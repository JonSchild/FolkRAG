=We are in the kitchen of Grace Ciolino. It's 11.10 am. 
Grace was born in 1943 in Detroit, Michigan. She tells me that her parents 
came to the U.S. in 1939 from a little town in Sicily called Terrasini (but 
later she will explain that her father was in Detroit longer before, and that 
her mother joined him in 1939). Grace has an older brother and two younger 
sisters. When she was three years old the family moved to San Pedro. 
Her father was a fisherman in Italy; when he moved to Detroit he opened a 
produce company with his brother but he was never satisfied. She says:" When 
you are a fisherman you always want to be a fisherman." So he came to San 
Pedro because he had some cousins and went fishing with them for about two 
months, then went back to Detroit where his family was, and packed everything 
and told his wife: "We are going to California." 
Her father did commercial fishing, he worked on a boat with ten men; they 
would go locally, for one or two days and during the summer for a week. 
Grace's father and her husband Dominic fished together. Grace's father and 
Dominic's father were brothers (so Grace and her husband are first cousins). 
Her husband came here 26 years ago from the same town Terrasini; they met in 
San Pedro and got married (later, when the husband arrives, we talk more about 
how they met). 
I ask Grace if she heard stories about her family's migration to this country: 
her father came with his father, one brother and one sister to Detroit. After 
about 10 years in Detroit her father went back to Italy and got engaged and 
married her mother but they did not consummate the marriage. She was 15 years 
old, and he was around 21. So he left again Italy and came back to America. 
During that time the war broke out. Her mother took the last boat that left 
Italy for America before the war really broke out. 
Her grandparents went back to Italy and died there. I ask her if she thinks 
that her father came to the States to stay or if he wanted to make some money 
and go back to Italy. She feels that he came to make money and go back, but 
then at that time America "was really blooming" and he really enjoyed America 
and ended up staying here. 
I ask her about her father's stories about fishing in Italy. She tells me that 
her father started to fish with his father when he was 8 years old. His father 
owned a boat, together with his 5 brothers, and was one of the 'well to do' in 
the city. Grace never got to know her grandfather but she tells me that her 
husband knew him or has heard stories about him. (Grace grandchild comes in 
with Grace's sister. She asks me to turn the tape-recorder off for a few 
minutes, until they leave again.) 
I ask Grace about her mother and her role in the family. 
She was a housewife, 
she says "she never worked." She describes her parents as "very traditional": 
the man was the breadwinner, he went to work and brought home the paycheck to 
her mom. Her mom took care of the house: she made bread. She says:"we had a 
T 
T; 
I( oo (

OL 
wonderful time"; she recalls that their house was always full of company. 
Her mother's name was Giuseppina (Josephine) and her father's name was 
Salvatore (Sam). He spoke English, while she spoke a very "broken" English. To 
the kids she spoke in Sicilian all the time and the kids answered back in 
Sicilian, while the father spoke to them in English, but he spoke Sicilian 
too. Grace's children learned Sicilian from their grandparents. Grace speaks 
Sicilian with her husband, with her kids and also with her grandchildren. 
I ask her if she visited Sicily. She says they went back 10 years ago, when 
her parents were still alive: "It was the most wonderful trip I have ever had: 
my children walked down the same streets that their grandparents walked down, 
their great-grandfathers walked down, because they all came from the same 
town. My husband visited the house he was born in. I saw the house that my 
grandparents lived in. It was the most wonderful feeling. The kids loved it. 
We stayed 6 weeks and when we left everybody cried and wanted to stay longer, 
but you have to get back to reality." She has two ants still alive in 
Terrasini and many cousins. She hopes to take her grandchildren there next 
year. 
I ask her if there are many people from Terrasini in San Pedro, and if they 
lived in the same neighbourhood. 
She says that there are quite a few families 
from Terrasini but that a lot of them came around 20 years ago. At that time 
they settled in different parts of San Pedro. Mostly, Italians lived in the 
lower part of San Pedro (below Gaffey street) and in the middle part. Not many 
Italians lived "further out", they all stayed "in the community", she says. 
She starts to talk about her daughter, who lives in the lower part of San 
Pedro and says that San Pedro is a very nice community and that is very 
difficult to move out, once you have experienced life here! 
I ask her about her 3 children (2 girls and 1 boy). Her son is in real-estate, 
her daughter is married and has 2 children, her little one is 16. Her son does 
not like fishing. I ask her if he worked in the fishing industry in the past 
but he never wanted to have anything to do with it. 
I ask her if her husband 
pushed his son into fishing, she says "not at all". I ask her if she thinks 
the young generation is getting away from the fishing business. 
She says that 
the fishing business is not doing very well, and this is the main reason. 
She 
also feels that her kids should do what they want to do. "If they wanted to be 
fishermen, I was behind them 100$.," Her son went to electronic school and 
worked in that area for three years, and she says "We were behind him 100%." 
But he was not happy with it. And now that he has his real-estate license, he 
is happy. Her daughter is a dental assistant, but she is not working right now 
because of her small children. She is also going for a real-estate license. 
The youngest daughter will go to college, she says. I ask her how she named 
her children and she says :"The typical italian." Her son Jerry is named after 
her father-in-law; her daughter Anna is named after her mother-in-law; and her 
daughter's name --Josette-- is a sort of nickname for Giuseppa, Grace's 
mother. (the telephone rings, I turn the tape-recorder off). 
She starts to talk about the extended family and says that they all are very 
Close. "Maybe was the way we were brought up." They have family gatherings 
"all the time": during the holidays, birthdays'parties; they go to the park 
together for the 4th of July with other Sicilian families from the same town 
and they play bocce game. She says: "We are the typical Italians; I am second 
generation, but I feel that I am more first generation than second." She says 
that her kids love that too. Her son, who is 24 years old, still loves to be 
with the family, and went with them to the park for the 4th of July instead of 
going to the beach with his friends. She feels that these feelings for the 
family are values passed on by her parents. 
I ask her about the duties of a fisherman's wife. She says: "A fisherman's 
wife has a harder life because has a total responsibility of the home and of 
raising the children." A fisherman is home for half a day, sometimes for two 
or three days, so he does not have the time to discipline the children. For 
her mother, she says, was even harder, because at the time she did not drive, 
so she had to walk to the store. "Women were not driving at that time." They 
had the milkman come, and they had the bread-man who used to come in his 
little truck, and the kids would go down to buy the American bread, the sliced 
one. Her mother baked bread every week. She did not have to cook for her 
husband when he went fishing, because every boat has a cook and they cook on 
the boat, but she had to take care of his clothing, like Grace does for her 
husband. 
I ask if her father used to tell stories about fishing around the table and 
she says: "Oh yes, even now our family uses the table as the conversation 
time. It's time for conversation, for memories, it's a wonderful time." Her 
dad used to tell a lot of stories about the depression in Detroit, bootlegging 
and staff like that, and how some of his friends got involved in that and how 
he stayed away from it. All the good times he had with his friends. Those were 
hard times, because a lot of people at those times were against Italians, 
because they thought of the mafia. He used to say that you get pretty tough 
because if people beat you up you get tougher. I ask her about the names that 
people used to call the Italians and how was the "atmosphere" in San Pedro. 
She says she does not recall bad names for Italians and says: "This community 
is very integrated. We have a lot of Blacks, Mexicans, lots of Slavonians and 
lots of Italians. I went to public school and I never had any problems and I 
don't think by brothers had any problems either. There were more problems 
among Italians, Italians not liking Italians for some reasons, you know, you 
are Sicilian and you are something else." I ask her if there was or still is a 
sort of rivalry between Sicilians and people from Ischia (Naples). She says 
"not really. There is always joking around. When we started our club (the 
Italian-American Club) 
they called it 
the Sicilian Club', because most of 
the people involved in the club are Sicilians but we do have other people. In 
these couple of years we really worked hard to get other people into the club 
and they start to come in now, which is really great." I ask her what the 
problems are in her opinion to get other groups into the club. She says that 
the main thing is to get involved. "If one person, maybe Roman, would come and 
join the club, they would pull in their relatives." 
We talk about the history of the club. The club was established 
20 years ago 
but it really did not work out. Six years ago Pasquale (the men's president) 
took over the club, it was a dying club, it was very quiet and he really 
helped the club. Then, four years ago he asked Grace to get involved. She put 
it off for a while, because her daughter was getting married, and then she 
decided to try it. She got a group together and started the woman's club 
division. They bought the building four years ago "which was just wonderful, 
the most exciting thing that has happened to the Italian Community in San 
Pedro." 
I ask her if she worked in her life. She was in real-estate. "I have worked 
many jobs: I started when I was 14, I worked for Fort McArthur (army base in 
San Pedro) as a clerk for many years." (A man enters the kitchen and Grace 
talks with him in Sicilian for a while, then she introduces me to him. I stop 
the tape-recorder and they tell me that tonight grandfather Ciolino is coming 
back from Italy and that the whole family is going to be at his house to have 
dinner together. The grandmother is going to cook "arancini" and I am invited 
to go with Grace to meet the family.) 
We continue to talk about her work. After Fort Mcarthur she had several other 
odd jobs, like working in a store, then as a typist for a real estate company, 
then she worked for a bridal company, typing and sending out flyers for the 
company. Then they owned their own shop too, a bridal registry, a store where 
the bride would go and pick up the china and gifts she liked as wedding 
presents. Grace owned the store with her brother and her little sister. I ask 
her if she thinks the wedding traditions are similar to the Italian ones. "Oh 
yes, they even put the trousseau out here, like in Italy. This town is really 
really traditional, you 
I ll be surprised. My sister-in-law, Grace Ciaramitaro, 
when her daughter got married, four years ago, she put out the trousseau just 
exactly like in our town, Terrasini." 
Side B 
I ask Grace if she did the same for her daughter. She says that she was too 
busy and that her sister-in-law is very good at these things. Her daughter had 
a trousseau too in a chest, and her youngest daughter has already the 
trousseau in the chest. She started to buy the items for the trousseau when 
her daughter was around 12/13 years old. When Grace went to Italy she bought 
table-cloths, in Tijuana she bought table-cloths for her. I ask her if her 
daughter bought things for the trousseau herself. She did not, everything was 
bought by the mother. I ask if she thinks her daughter will buy the trousseau 
for her kids and she says she hopes so, since she realizes that when you get 
married you have a lot of debts to start off with and its nice to fill your 
drawers with towels and nice table-cloths and nice things. She lists for me 
the things that were in her daughter's trousseau: underwear, night-gowns, 
towels. I ask if she bought a specific number of items (knowing that usually 
in Sicily everything is bought "a dodici" that is twelve pieces of everything 
or multiple of twelve). She says she bought a dozen sheets, tops and bottoms, 
a couple of dozens of towels in different sizes, dish-towels, aprons, and then 
right before she got married she bought dresses and clothing. I ask if she 
would do the same for her son. She says that she knows in Italy the boy would 
get pots and pans, but that here you get everything for the shower, and that 
showers in San Pedro are "very traditional, you get everything from A to Z." 
The relatives usually buy washing machine and dryer, you get almost everything 
for your home. 
"The mother usually buys the bedroom set, and pays for half of 
the wedding, and the mother-in-law buys the living-room set. Uncles and ants--
this is what is in our family, and in most of the italian families in San 
Pedro--they get together and they buy the refrigerator, the washer and dryer, 
so they start out really good." I ask her if it was the same when she got 
married. She says that things were not so good when she got married, "it 
wasn't like today." Her father and father-in-law bought the t.v. At that time, 
her husband paid for the wedding. I ask if that was traditional. She says: 
"well, it really was, the man paid for the wedding. Now it switched over, now 
the parents pay for the wedding." Her husband also paid for the furniture. I 
ask about her wedding dress. Her mother paid for it; it was a white dress and 
she says that the white dress is the norm today. She mentions that Italian 
weddings are big, with a lot of people and a lot of bride-maids and ushers. 
(The man in the kitchen has just finished to prepare coffee, and they offer me 
a cup. Dominic, her husband comes in and for a while is in the kitchen 
listening to us but not participating in the interview. I continue to ask 
Grace about wedding traditions.) 
I ask how they call the trousseau in Sicilian and she says "corredo" (same as 
in italian). I ask if it includes money or jewelry. She says that in Italy it 
does, but here it does not. I ask about the material of the sheets and 
trousseau items. She says that usually people buy things "ricamata" 
(embroidered) and that she gave her daughter one pair of sheets that belonged 
to her mother. However she mostly bought perma-press staff for her daughter, 
"because we are here in America." 
I ask if there is anybody in San Pedro who 
embroiders. She knows somebody who does, but not like in Italy. Her mother 
used to embroider; the sheets she gave her daughter are embroidered by her. 
Grace never used the sheets, she says: "they are too beautiful, not just too 
beautiful, too sentimental." 
She says that a lot of Sicilians still do "the corredo" in San Pedro because: 
"It's something that their parents gave them and that helped them were they 
were young, it is really a traditional thing but is very useful so is a great 
thing to keep the tradition." 
(There is a lot of noise between the coffe being served on the table and the 
kid who came back). 
I ask Grace if she quit her job when she got married. She says that she 
continued to work, that she is more "americanized." 
I ask her how she met her husband. He came from Italy with his father when he 
was very young and he stayed with Grace's family for a couple of years. They 
were engaged for about a year, but they had known each other for many years. 
(Grace's daughter Anna comes in and leaves soon after.) 
I ask Grace if would have been a problem for her family if she did not marry 
an Italian. She says that probably her parents would not have been happy. All 
her brothers and sisters as well as her husband's brothers and sisters are 
married to Italians. I ask her how she feels about her children. She says that 
she wants them to be happy. Her daughter married an Italian and her son and 
younger daughter are not engaged. She says she would like for them to marry 
Italians because "we have special traditions and it's nice when they 
understand the same type of life that you have." 
We start to talk again about the Italian-American club. I ask about the 
activities they have. At one o'clock in the afternoon a group of retired old 
men opens the club. They play cards until around four o'clock. Every wednesday 
evening men and women play bingo. The first friday of each month they have 
what they call "family night," they cook dinner for the families who belong to 
the club. Grace says: "it's a time to get together with all your friends." 
Around 100 people participate to these dinners during the winter time. The 
club has 300 members circa. 
Every year they plan different things: they have a Easter picnic, which brings 
together 700 people according to Grace. They rent a place which is all 
enclosed at a park, the club members do all the cooking, they play bocce game, 
they have a bunny rabbit who gives out presents for the kids, they have a d.j. 
who plays italian music. Then they have a Christmas party on december 22nd; 
and this year they have an italian music band from Canada. Usually the local 
band of Tony De Bruno plays at the Christmas party. Then they have a Halloween 
party at the club. 
I ask her about saints' celebrations and she says that they do not celebrate 
those because St. Mary of the Star church has the celebration of Saint Joseph 
every year. She also mentions that her mother-in-law has a San Giuseppe too. 
There are Sicilians here in San Pedro who have San Giuseppe. I ask what she 
means by "they have San Giuseppe" and she explains that her mother-in-law puts 
up an altar for the saint, she makes her own bread, and her own pasta, the 
special pasta of San Giuseppe. She explains that this is a "dovere" (an act of 
devotion) for her daughter Anna who could not have children, and she was 
having a very hard time coping with that. Her mother-in-law prayed to San 
Giuseppe: "if you have my daughter have children then I'll have 'dovere' for 
you." And her sister-in-law had a beautiful daughter and her mother-in-law has 
had "dovere" for 10/15 years now. Grace knows at least 3 families who every 
year have "dovere" to Saint Joseph. I ask her to describe what happens during 
the ceremony. Everybody comes to her mother-in-law's house and they pray for a 
week and then there is the festival at the house. Her father-in-law dresses as 
San Giuseppe and someone else dresses as Mary. Grace mentions that her 
brother-in-law has a video of the whole thing and later we arrange to come 
back another time to watch the video. (see IAW-PT-AO03 and A004 for precise 
description of the whole ritual). 
Mary Star has a big festival for Saint Joseph too. Grace says that the whole 
church is involved and after that they have a big meal in the auditorium. I 
ask if Saint Joseph is the protector of the fishermen and she asks her husband 
who says that the protector of fishermen is Saint Peter. Grace says that at 
Mary Star there is a huge statue of Saint Peter holding a fishing boat. I ask 
if the statue was donated by Italians, she says that Italians and Slavonians 
donated a lot of money to the church but not in particular for that statue. 
I ask Grace if there is a bocce club. She tells me that there is no club to 
play bocce and then she goes back to the Italian-American club 's activities. 
In the evenings it opens at six and men go there. They have a little bar that 
serves italian coffee, cappuccino, italian mineral water and chinotto (italian 
soda) and people go there to meet their friends, talk and play cards. 
Sometimes they rent the club on saturdays and sundays to help pay the payments 
of the building. 
The club is also involved in the fishermen fiesta (september 
29th to october 1st). The club has a booth and they sell meat-balls and 
spaghetti that they make, cannoli made by the women and italian coffee. The 
women get together in the kitchen of the club and make all these things. I ask 
if somebody is in charge of the cooking. She says that Grace Ciaramitaro, her 
sister-in-law, takes care of most of the cooking. 
I ask Grace if she considers her cooking italian or what. She says "I cook 
italian. Very rarely I cook American food because my husband is a typical 
italian. He loves italian food." She cooks pasta a lot, they barbecue fish a 
lot; they cook meat the italian way ("stufato" stew with vegetables). 
Dominic, Grace's husband starts to interact with us when we talk about food. I 
ask him where he goes fishing. He goes fifty miles below San Diego. They sell 
the fish to the canneries. Now is the season of tuna and bonita (same family 
of tuna but with a softer meat). There are 10 other guys on the boat with him. 
His crue has been together for a long time (20 years?). 
(I have a hard time understanding him, so I ask him to join us at the table. 
He agrees and sits down with us and I clip the lavalier mic to his shirt.)' 
I tell him that his wife told me his father was a fisherman, and ask if he 
learned from him. He says :"Ya, from the old country. I started to fish at 10 
years old, in Terrasini." His family had two boats but when his father and him 
left Terrasini nobody really took good care of the boats and they sold out. I 
ask why his father wanted to come to the States. He says "for a better 
living." When they first arrived they stopped for three weeks in Detroit where 
his father's brothers were living. As soon as they arrived in San Pedro his 
father went fishing while he went to school for a year. He did not graduate 
from high school. He recalls his father's words: "we need the money, we need 
?T-AO 
the money, you need to work." He and his father went to live with Grace's 
family. Grace's mother was against their relationship because they were 
cousins. I know that some time ago you needed a special permission from the 
church to marry a relative. Dominic recalls that they had to write to the Pope 
(?) to get this special permission. 
They got married at Mary Star 
He says: 
"The fishermen build that church. All fishermen's money."

While I change the tape we talk about the statue in the church. First Grace 
told me that it was the statue of St. Peter, now Dominic refers to it as the 
statue of St. Anthony. Anyway I want to talk about fishing with Dominic and I 
ask him "So you fished all your life?" "All my life, since I was a kid." He 
says that there is no special teaching, you just do what everybody else is 
doing, you learn doing it. 
I ask him why he did not teach his kid. He says 
that his son does not like fishing, he does not even like to eat fish! I ask 
him to talk about his grandfather. He says; "My grandfather was a smart guy. 
Before he came to the States he went to Africa with a sail boat, and this was 
120/130 years ago." He went to Africa to get the fish, salt it in wood barrels 
and then brought it to Sicily to sell it. Then he came to the States, to 
Detroit, but went back and forth from Sicily to Detroit three times. He had 
three kids in Detroit and six back in Sicily. Dominic's father is the youngest 
son. He came to the States with his son Dominic in 1955, they started the 
immigration papers in 1953; it took them to years. Dominic says: "If you were 
French, no problem, but if you were Italian it took a long time." When they 
arrived in New York, the family from Detroit was there to pick them up with a 
car. "700 miles from New York to Detroit." 
His mother came with the rest of her children two and a half years later. I 
ask Dominic how she managed travelling alone without speaking English. "You 
know what happened? They took the train in New York all the way to Detroit and 
they fell asleep on the train. They passed Detroit and went to another town, 
Ann Arbor." The family waiting in detroit for them went crazy and finally went 
to pick them up at the next stop. 
I ask Dominic if there was a person in San Pedro who acted as their "helper" 
when they first got here. Grace answers: "My father. He was the one who made 
the papers for them to come." He was the one hold responsible for them by the 
immigration office. 
I ask Dominic: "If you could go back in life, would you be a fisherman again?" 
He says: "No, no, it's no good to be a fisherman. 
Nobody likes to be a 
fisherman, I don't know why but everybody likes to stay out of the sea." 
I ask him when was is biggest catch. His wife answers for him: "Tuna, last 
year." 
"We got 30 tuna, and you know how big they were? We broke the record 
for the west coast of the United States! We got a tuna one thousand and fifty 
pounds! Never caught before in the history of the United States. They sold it 
for 27 dollars a pound, they sold it in Japan... Americans cannot afford to buy 
that fish. In Japan they had an auction and they bet on it." 
I ask him if he owns the boat he works on. He says he does not want to own a 
boat "because you go crazy. Different guys: who complains here, who complains 
there; who don't like this, who don't like that. I work on a share base, that 
I like it." I ask which language he speaks with the other men in the crew, he 
says he speaks italian because most men don't understand English. They talk 
all the time about the old country, in italian. Dominic comments: "I say, why 
RT-AOO -•, a 
don't you say something about here?" He says that they go back to Italy once 
on a while, on vacation. They would like to go back for good but their wives 
don't want to go! I ask them what the reason for this is. Grace says: 
" You 
are established here in America already, why do you want to take that chance 
of moving your whole family, and then the children get older.." Dominic 
interrupts: "Because life is easier overthere for men. You work, if you make 
money, you make, if you don't, you don't, you still live anyway..You don't 
have all the taxes you have here, you don't have big payments on the house 
like you do here, you mostly walk, most people don't have a car, and gas, and 
insurance. You have all kinds of different bills overhere. If you don't make 
it, it's hard." 
I ask if they think that women have more freedom in this country. Dominic 
goes: 
" whatever the man makes he gives the paycheck to his wife, the wife 
gets in the car, goes to the store,shops around here and there, go shower 
here, shower there. The men go to work, go to fish, they come back they go to 
the house: from the boat to the house, from the house to the boat. They never 
get to go no place. They know nothing about United States." 
Dominic goes on 
complaining about the life of a fisherman: "You have to eat when you are not 
hungry, sleep when you are not sleepy." 
_PT-"4Go 
T IAW-PT-A003=Grace explains all the phases of the Saint Joseph's day 
celebration following the events as they appear on the videotape filmed by 
Mimmo Bologna, one of Grace's brother-in-laws. 
Some time before the feast, Grace's mother-in-law (Dominic's mother) has the 
priest come to her house to bless the home-made bread, the fruit, and food 
that people bring for Saint Joseph. A week before Saint Joseph day (march 19) 
family members and friends go every night to the house to say Saint Joseph 
rosary. 
The video shows the three people who play the roles of Saint Joseph, the 
Blessed Mary and baby Jesus: they start out in the alley and they walk around 
the block three times, a ritual reenactment of the Holy Family's search for 
lodging in Bethlehem. People sing in Italian, I catch only a few 
lines:"...camminando per le strade...che pena the dolore, poverini the stanno 
fuori." 
Saint Joseph (Dominic's father) knocks three times at the door and asks for 
lodging: "Siam tre poveri pellegrini the si vogliono ripara' (we are three 
poor wanderers looking for lodging)." The woman inside replies: "La casa mia 
non e' locanda vate vi un' altra banda (My house is not a lodge, go somewhere 
else)." Then they go around the block again and then knock again asking the 
same question. This time the person inside replies: "Non c'e' luogo, non c'e' 
posto (there is no room, there is no place)." 
I ask who usually plays the role of Mary. Grace says that a lot of time are 
people who are sick who play the part. 
The third time that Saint Joseph knocks at the door he says "Siamo Gesu', 
Giuseppe, a Maria." The person inside opens the door and repeating their names 
out loud lets them in. Everybody applauds. 
Inside, the three impersonated saints sit down and are served every portion of 
what is on the table. First of all they are served Saint Joseph pasta, which 
is home-made maccheroni with five different kinds of beans and finocchio 
(fennel) added to it. This pasta is made only for this occasion, "it's the 
basic thing for saint Joseph," as Grace says. The camera moves to the 
different food on display on the table: there are special shaped breads, 
different kinds of cookies, and fish, artichokes, eggplant, broccoli. (meat is 
not allowed, I guess because St. Joseph's day falls during Lent). People give 
donations, and Dominic's mother sends the money to poor people in Italy. It is 
Dominic's mother who pays for all the food but relatives and friends help her 
cooking it. 
Grace explains that her mother-in-law started this act of devotion to Saint 
Joseph because one of her daughter, after being married for five years, did 
not have any children. She prayed to Saint Joseph "If my daughter has a baby 
I'll do this as long as I can..." She has done this for 13 years, since her 
niece, Joanna was born. 
While the video shows people eating Grace tells us that there is another 
tradition in San Pedro: "There is a woman who has a statue of Saint Joseph'and 
they bring it to their home and then they have their friends come over and 
they have like prayers for three days. Then they take the statue and bring it 
to another home and people come. And also they give donations and donations 
are given to an orphanage." The statue is about three feet. Grace continues: 
"My mother-in-law does not have a statue but that picture that she has of 
Saint Joseph is over one hundred years old. Her mother had it, and her 
mother." The painting of Saint Joseph holding Jesus hangs over the 
table/altar. 
There are four families in San Pedro who have the Saint Joseph celebration, 
PT-Aoo -31-2 
and then Mary Star celebrates it too. The members of the Italian Catholic 
federation cook the traditional food for St, Joseph's day. 
The video of Saint Joseph is followed by a video of a Halloween Party at the 
Italian American Club. The club has a Halloween party for children, one for 
teenagers, and one for adults every year. Grace speaks briefly about the other 
events sponsored by the Italian American Club (Christmas dance; picnic). We 
watch the video and comment on the different customs. 
The next video on the same tape is the Easter picnic that the Italian American 
club sponsors every year at a local park. The board of directors cooks the 
food: they have a big barbecue with chicken, sausages, and spaghetti. There 
are several contests: the video shows the kids doing the sack race contest. 
Grace tells us that they have bocce games, baseball, and at five o'clock the 
D.J. comes in and they start dancing. They also have an Easter egg hunt for 
the kids. The Easter picnic has been going on for the past four years. 
Grace tells us that she will try to get the video that somebody else shot of 
the tarantella dance that a group of club members performed during the San 
Pedro Traditions Festival last february. "We were also involved in the parade 
(for the one hundred years of San Pedro). Seven women of our club got together 
and brought seven sewing machine down at the club and they sewed about forty 
customs in one week for all the kids, boys and girls. Every region in Italy 
was represented... all the material was donated, all the colors were the same 
colors that they were supposed to be, the little handkerchiefs on their heads, 
they were adorable." 
Side 2 
Grace and Dominic continue to talk about the parade which featured also a 
float with the first Italian fishing families in San Pedro, Di Bernardo and 
Carrisi. 
Then we ask about the Italian American club. Grace says that it started 20 
years ago but then died out because nobody was really interested in it. Then 
six years ago Pat Colaruotolo (president of the men's division) took over: it 
was in a little place, a garage. They had a bar and a pool table; a few people 
used to go there and play cards. Then Pat, who is Grace's cousin, asked her to 
get the women involved. She got together fifteen women and set up a big 
meeting at the Portofino restaurant, open to friends and families of the 
women. By word of mouth they gathered 125 people: everybody was excited and 
signed up for the club. A week after that they had the elections and Grace was 
elected president, and she still is the president of the women's division. 
Three months after the elections the house that hosts the club now came up for 
sale. The club had 10 thousand dollars on its name, money collected by the men 
over the years. Grace called a Sicilian fisherman very influential in San 
Pedro, who has a lot of shares in the Bank of San Pedro, and asked him to help 
them get a loan through Bank of San Pedro to buy the property. He told Grace: 
"You go ahead and put an offer in... I'll take care of it ... don't worry about 
it, you put an offer, twenty per cent down, I'll take care of everything... if 
the bank will not do it, I have people who'll do it. Because he is well to do 
and he has a lot of influence... The offer was accepted and we bought the club. 
Now we had to get the money together, right? We started to writing letters to 
a lot of people, a lot of people in our club donated money ... we got together 
about 25 thousand dollars before the escrow was closed ... we signed a loan, 
that we were responsible for the loan. If anything happens to the club, the 
club was to fail, all the money that was in the club, all the property and 
7("T-14vv-3 
value whatever, is sold and goes to charity. No one benefits at all from the 
club—The building was in really bad shape... everybody donated their time; we 
got so much money donated to buy wall paper, drapes, the cement men came in 
and did all the cement, all doors, all the money was donated to fix it up." 
Grace goes on explaining in details other financial moves that they did to 
refinance the club. Al Galletti, another influential Italian American from 
Terrasini, same town where the Ciolino come from and who grew up together with 
Grace, he put up a benefit in Los Angeles and some of that money (twenty 
thousand dollars) came to the Italian American club. 
"We are having a problem, I don't know why we are having this problem: a lot 
of people feel that this is a Sicilian club, but it is not. We are trying to 
tell them it is not a Sicilian club but we need them to start coming into the 
club, for they can start bringing their friends and it will be different... if 
all the Italians in San Pedro got together we'd have the biggest club." 
It seems that there is a division between Sicilians, who belong to the Italian 
American club and the Ischitani who belong to the Italian Catholic federation. 
Grace and Dominic talk about the differences in the two organizations. 
Grace talks about the Fishermen's fiesta in which the club is involved at the 
end of september. She compares the fiesta they have now with the one they used 
to have at the time of her father: "The way they really decorated the boats, 
now they don't do anything, they just put a few little flags on them, that's 
it. Half of the fleet is out fishing because they don't even care about the 
fiesta, because it really was a fishermen's fiesta one time, now it isn't, 
it's just a commercial." 
Grace tries to find a movie of the fishermen's fiesta that she filmed 25 years 
ago. She cannot find it but promises to look for it and make a copy for us. 
She finds another video she filmed when a group of women went fishing with 
their husband. We watch it. 
The interview continues on IAW-PT-A004) 
T IAW-PT-A004=Interview continues from IAW-PT-AO03 
We are watching the video that Grace filmed when she went fishing on her 
husband's boat about ten years ago. Dominic explains to us all the phases of 
fishing anchovies. Grace moves quickly through the tape looking for the video 
of the fishermen's fiesta, which she cannot find. We see strips of her 
parents' fiftieth marriage anniversary; of her daughter's baptism; of the 
family's first and last trip to Terrasini,'Sicily, eleven years ago. This 
video focuses on barbecuing fish in the yard of their cousins's home where the 
family stayed. Grace describes her impression about her first trip to Italy: 
"I felt like I had gone back in time about forty years... it was such a great 
feeling knowing that I'm walking down the streets that my grandparents, and 
great grandparents ... they called us 'the Americani' ... I'm Italian, I'm not 
American, you know! 'Americanil' There was a lot of people from America 
though, from San Pedro who were there on vacation." 
The video shows images of a festival during which they had a pole climbing 
contest in the ocean: they grease a pole and lay it over the ocean. People try 
to climb it and if you climb to the end you win a price; a lot of people fall 
into the ocean. 
The next scene shows the procession of the Madonna delle Grazie, patron Saint 
of Terrasini. Dominic goes into the bedroom and comes back with a picture of 
Maria Santissima delle Grazie, patrona di Terrasini: this explains why so many 
women from that town are named Grace, after the patron saint.

TIAW-PT-A005=Interview in Italian at the restaurant "La Piccola Trattoria," 
owned by Franco Doardi. 
Franco talks about his passion for paintings. He says it is a is brotthheer 
di 
famiglia, 
a family passion: his father attended art school, his brother 
paints, he himself paints and his little daughter is good at drawing too. He 
never went to school to learn about painting. He says of himself "I have a lot 
of fantasy." 
The restaurant's walls are covered with his paintings depicting 
Venice, Italy, his home town in "a catastrophic way." He painted all the 
pictures of this decaying or dying Venice since he moved to the States: "It 
must be being far away, because before I never painted Venice... before I 
painted still life, landscapes, the sea." 
Franco came alone to the States almost nine years ago. He started to paint 
from the beginning, because he had a lot of spare time without his family. He 
came to work as a cook in the restaurant that two Italian Americans 
(originally from Ischia) and two more recent immigrants from Ischia were going 
to open in San Pedro. He met one of the people from Ischia while working in 
Sicily as a cook. 
In Italy Franco worked as a seasonal w orker, in ski resorts during the winter 
and sea resorts in the summer. His wife says that it was his choice to work 
out of Venice. She says: "We have been married for 25 years, but I had to come 
to America to be with him!" Franco also worked in Germany for three years. His 
wife tried to live in Germany with him when their first daughter was little, 
but did not like it and returned to Italy where she had her own job. She 
worked as "capo-zona" (area manager) for a cleaning contractor, a j 
ob which 
she liked because it allowed her to travel and meet a lot of people. coming to 
America meant for her to give up her job, and at the beginning it was 
difficult for her to adjust to her new job as bus girl. 
Franco has worked as a cook for 27 years. He learned, as he says "alla scuola 
dei vecchi," (the old timers' school), which means that he learned by working 
since he was young. He learned different regional cooking styles by working 
all over the country. In his restaurant now he cooks northern food, and many 
Venetian specialties. 
They comment on the differences between Italian food and Italian-American 
food. His wife says: "Most of the people who came here and opened restaurants 
did not know anything about cooking. They started here." Franco comments that 
people cooked what they had been eating at home, what their mothers used to 
cook. I ask if they know how the famous spaghetti and meatballs came to be 
identified with the typical Italian food: "In Italy, in some families, 
especially in the south, many years ago they had to put food together: they 
made the polpette (meatballs), the sauce, and pasta and put everything 
together. of course you don't find this in the restaurants in Italy, these 
were things that they used to eat at home." I ask what she says to people who 
order spaghetti and meatballs at the restaurant: "Look, this is an Italian 
spaghetti with meatballs in Italy and then I suggest 
re staurant, we don't eat 
 
auce, which is very rich . 
spaghetti with our meat s 
 
Franco worked for ten months in this same restaurant which had a different 
name. Then two of the partners left (the restaurant was too small for four 
partners), and Franco and his family (arrived a few months before) accepted 
the offer of another Italian man who was going to open a restaurant in Benin, 
near Palm Spring. The offer looked very promising but in the end Franco was 
defrauded: they signed papers to buy a house and payed a lot of money every 
month but ended up not owning the house at all. Since they were not completely 
'legal' in the States they could not take any legal actions and basically

returned  to San Pedro with no money at all: "We really had to start from 
scratch." Both Franco and his wife went to work for a new Italian restaurant, 
"I1 Piccolo," that opened at Ports o'Call. They worked there for four years 
until the restaurant changed management. Then Franco went to work in Beverly 
Hills in a Venetian restaurant for six months and his wife stayed home. Then 
for ten months they both went back to work at the restaurant "I1 Piccolo," at 
Ports o'Call but the relation with the owner was not satisfying. Franco went 
to work in west Hollywood at another Venetian restaurant: "Rondo," while his 
wife started to work as waitress at the restaurant that they own now, "La 
Piccola Trattoria." 
(The daughter, Lara, and Toni, an Italian friend of the family who has been 
recently hired to help in the restaurant come in.) 
Side 2 
The owner of "La Piccola Trattoria," had sold the restaurant "I1 Piccolo" at 
Ports o' Call. That restaurant had been very successful while the new one, 
located in a less touristic place, was not working as well. Franco and his 
wife knew that he was not happy with the new restaurant and offered to buy it. 
They bought the restaurant one and a half year ago. I ask if the Italian-
American community helped them financially. The wife says that the Italian 
community does the opposite. If their restaurant has been successful is 
because their clients are American. The few Italian friends that they had have 
disappeared since they opened the restaurant. They think that it is a form of 
jealousy as far as the business is concerned. 
Since they bought the restaurant they have changed its decor. The previous 
owner had pictures of Ischia hanging on the walls; they substituted those with 
Franco's paintings of Venezia. The color of the walls and the tablecloths 
changed too. They would have liked to change the name of the restaurant too, 
but it costed too much and they decided to keep "La Piccola Trattoria." The 
wife wanted to call it "Bella Venezia," or "La Gondola." Lara, the daughter, 
would like to call it "I1 Romantico." She explains: "People want to be 
romantic when they go to a restaurant... and there is too much about Venice 
anyway: everybody says they are Venetians, wherever you go, Bella Venezia, 
Venezia here, Venezia there, and nobody is venetian!" 
Lara (20 years old) tells me about her work in the restaurant. She has worked 
as waitress during busy nights, and as bus girl to substitute her mother. She 
has always been in charge of the bookkeeping, payrolls, and monthly taxes. I 
ask where she learned and she says that she taught herself. Silvia (16 years 
old), the other daughter has worked in the restaurant from the beginning as 
bus girl. The girls do not receive a salary; they are expected to help the 
family and receive money when they need it. Now Lara is planning to teach her 
sister the bookkeeping since in nine months she is going to graduate from 
school and plans to go on with her career as paralegal. Lara says that the 
restaurant business fascinates her but she does not think to have inherited 
the courage that her parents have: "I like to work for them, with them, I like 
to see the work done, but if it were mine, I don't know if I could make it." 
The wife tells how difficult has been for her to make the decision to leave 
Italy and move to the States. She says that she did it because of Lara who was 
really suffering the absence of her father. Lara recalls: "My school mates had 
told me that there were sharks in California, and my dad told me on the phone 
that he had been swimming in the ocean in december. I thought I was going to 
-A, 
oos1 ? 
die!" The wife and the two daughters left with a tourist visa after having 
sold all their belongings and left with the intention of settling permanently 
in America. 
Lara was 11 years old when they came to America and, as everybody else in the 
family, she did not know any English. 
Lara says that she learned English quickly thanks to two teachers in the town 
of Benin, who taught her intensively. "They told me 'In six months you will 
speak English' ... and they kept their promise. They were really good. People 
tell me that I was good but I know that I would not have learned so well if it 
were not for them." 
Franco and his wife do not speak English well. Franco learned more Spanish 
than English since he works always in the kitchen with Mexican helpers. His 
wife relies a lot on her daughter when she is around and seems to speak 
English well only when she is angry, Lara says. The parents admit that they 
depend on Lara for most of the work that requires speaking or writing in 
English and show their concern for the imminent future when Lara will not have 
too much time to dedicate to the restaurant. 
I ask if they would return to Italy if they had a good job opportunity there. 
Lara says definitely that she would not go back. She says: "My life is here 
now. I have my school here, my friends, my boyfriend ... on vacation for sure. I 
already told my boyfriend that our honeymoon must be in Italy!"

Silvia, the youngest daughter, likes the work at the restaurant but says that 
it is not what she wants to do for ever! Her passion is for music, she is now 
putting together a band with her friends (she plays the key board) and wants 
to go to school and become a paralegal like her sister: "To have a secure 
job 
Lara, like the whole family, likes opera. She listens to the music of the 
sixties and seventies to which all her friends refer to and that she does not 
know. She says: "Music is just part of society, so you just have to know it, 
and I don't. I know the things right now but most people don't even appreciate 
it, so you might as well go for the old staff, and go for the safe things." 
I ask if Lara's boyfriend speaks Italian, she says that he is trying to learn 
it. She says that they want their children to speak both German and Italian 
(her boyfriend is of German descent and speaks German fluently).

Lara and her mother tell me their immigration story. The whole family had to 
go back to Italy with the immigration papers. The American consul in Genova 
did not give them any trouble and signed the papers. When they arrived in New 
York, the immigration officer treated them "like animals," ordering them 
around in bad manners. The mother thought: "Where are we? In America or did we 
make a mistake and landed in Russia?" 
Lara says: "These people, they have an attitude problem, I think. They are not 
suited right for the job, they should be trained differently...I think they 
have a feeling that people who migrate here are taking over their job 
positions... they started asking questions and starting asking about my 
cousin ... they asked me to translate because there was no one that could be 
translating Italian to English...I did not want to give the wrong answers 
because I did not want her to leave and I knew they could have popped her back 
up on a plane and send her right back ... The first time she came here she 
stayed here a little longer than she was allowed to stay so on the passport 
there was still the ticket saying when she was supposed to go back and ... they 
realized she had left late. 
'What is she going to do? Leave always late? Why 
is she coming here this time? How long is she going to stay here? What is she 
going to do? What school ?... He asked me a question, which I really don't 
remember what it was and then turned to my mother to ask what the answer 
should have been. I did the wrong thing: he jumped at me, he said: 'This is 
not a three way conversation, DO YOU UNDERSTAND?' He goes: 'You are going to 
translate for me and that's itl If you can't do that then I get someone else 
and she is going to go right back to Italy.' He was screaming...I was just 
falling apart, I mean, I thought: if you want to get somebody emotionally 
distressed, you are doing a great job, a fourteen year old kid, let me tell 
you! ... He kept screaming at me. He reached the point in screaming where I was 
not understanding what he was saying anymore...I was just begging God, let it 
end, let it end. I don't care if I'm never going to come back here. And that 
thought, the thought that crossed me was: Why did I ever come here to get 
treated like this. I want to go back! I don't even want to stay here 
anymore ... So anyway, we all got it over with, finally he stamped her, threw 
her out of there and he did give it to her for six months. They knew the girl 
was going to stay, and he knew the girl was going to school here ... The minute 
I stepped out of that room, I lost it, I lost control of myself and I burst 
into tears, I was crying like a baby, I could not stop...I was thinking, you 
know: welcome to America!" 
The customs officer, who had been listening to the whole thing, was very nice 
to them, he smiled and let them pass without checking anything. Lara says: 
P 
T 
,/oo (, ;;?- 
"There were three or four people doing this to us, screaming at the top of 
their lungs; and there goes along one person, just one person that gives you 
one smile and treats you nice and it takes all that anger away ... there are 
kids that go through that and they want to retaliate from what happened, and 
they don't know about that but I understand, because at that moment, I wanted 
to retaliate. And some people grow along that, just from one experience... so 
they go into gangs...I show you who is the boss!" 
Lara goes on telling of her experience in San Diego when she saw the border 
patrol running after a group of Mexicans: "My heart scrunched, it was like a 
tight squeeze, Oh my God! What if I wasn't lucky enough to be an Italian, what 
if I would have been unlucky and had to be born in a country where the only 
way of coming here is through doing that? And when people say 'they cross the 
border every day, they take this away, they take that away,' I say 'Shut your 
mouth! Why don't you try to understand the situation. They don't have anything 
there... In my own little way I had to go through that ... The fear they were 
having, we had the same fear for three years, you know. Different lawyers did 
different things: one eloped, another one eloped, until you find the good 
one... Oh ya, no problem, and then something falls apart and you never see 
them again. They keep your money and elope... You kind of look in the yellow 
pages and you find jerks ... The first time you come here you are like a blind 
bat in the day time. You are so confused! And months go by and you are still 
confused." The mother stresses the fact that the first "bidonata," the first 
swindle, came from an Italian. 
I ask Lara if she is still in contact with Italian friends. She says "...all 
my old friends, all the friends that used to be my pals, you can write to them 
the first year, but that's it, there is no way. You don't know what to say 
anymore in letters, you got nothing to relate to...I went to see my best 
friend and it was the biggest disappointment in my life. She changed, she 
wasn't the person I used to remember... she wasn't a good good girl, she wasn't 
even nearly good, period." 
Side 2 
Lara met her boyfriend two years ago in school. She talks about a plan they 
have to go for a year to detroit where he could get a degree in mechanics. The 
mother reacts right away and speaking in Venetian dialect says that she did 
not know about this! Lara says is only one of the many plans they make and 
they don't know yet what they will end up doing. The mother says: "It's 
logical that she is going to get married but I was hoping that we would remain 
all together!" Lara replies: "If you don't take one year of sacrifice, you can 
have a life of sacrifice. You'd better take one year of sacrifice and 
sacrifice everything and then have the best!" 
Lara is very close to her 
boyfriend and cannot stand the idea of a separation, not even for a few weeks. 
Joking, her mother says that she will go with them on their honeymoon! 
I ask the girls if they know how to cook Italian food. They have favorite 
dishes but are not into cooking much. Lara says her favorite food is Italian 
food, naturally "there is not a single thing I don't like. I don't go crazy 
for meat sauce...I love sea food, as long as it is cooked. I'm a pasta person. 
You just feed me, I eat everything!" 
The mother says that her husband refuses to cook at home. I ask what they eat 
for the holydays. They make turkey for Thanksgiving, the traditional lamb for 
Easter, tortellini in brodo for Christmas "as I did in Italy, I keep the 
traditions."

I ask about their relations with the Italian American community and if they 
are involved in the Italian American club. They never got involved with the 
club in San Pedro. Their experience with Italian Americans goes back to the 
period they spent in Benin, near Palm Spring and the mother says that: "when 
the sicilians are together, they ignore you totally." Lara adds: "They are all 
'compari,' one stood godfather to one's child, the other stood godmother for 
the Comunion ceremony... they were all linked to each other in one way or 
another, and we were not linked in anyway!" 
I talk about the club in San Pedro and the mother says: "What would we do at 
the club, we would be like 'white flies'(a rarity)." 
Lara and her mother describe 
Franco worked on. He usually 
in his garage until he finds 
'skeleton' of a big guitar which he

the fact that he portrays Venice as 
that he misses 
my father, and 
about

freedom. He liked the fact that me and my sister could have had a future, 
opportunities, choices...in Italy you can go to school, you can go to school 
all your life, but then, unless you know somebody ... but even if you know 
somebody... it's difficult." 
The mother adds that he likes America for himself too, he likes the 
opportunity to try and work as much as you want.

I ask the mother if she is buying the trousseau for her daughters. She says 
that when she was in Italy the daughters were too little to be thinking about 
it, and now, in America it does not make much sense to think about it. She 
knows that when they finish school and have their jobs they are going to have 
money to buy what they like and what they want. As a mother she will help 
financially for the wedding itself. "My mother bought the 'corredo' for me: 
all these sheets that I had for twenty years and I got tired of them. I would 
have preferred something different." 
I ask for the dates of birth of the entire family: 
Roberta, the mother, was born in 1944 
Franco, the father, was born in 1941

Lara talks about the relations of her American friends with their mothers. 
"They look at their mother more like as a dictator, you know, really, they 
don't look at her as someone, like a person ... most often I think it ends up 
being the bad way more than the good way...they do it the wrong way. Instead 
of saying, if the mother goes 'Be home at ten,' 
'Mom, no problem.' No they go 
'Why do I have to be home at ten'." 
Toni brings a dish of pasta for me. Lara continues in Italian because there 
are American clients in the restaurant. She says that her friends do not try 
to understand their mothers, they don't try to be friends. She feels young 
people are pressured by going to parties and drinking, and smoking, and they 
don't try to put themselves in their parents' shoes. I ask if she ever 
considered to live together with her boyfriend before getting married. She 
would not do it: "It's not that I don't approve it ... but before doing it there 
should be a very good reason for making that decision ... We have to grow up, he 
is 21, I'm 20, and we only have to wait for two or three years. If he were two 
or three years older he would marry me, but he says that we live in a society, 
here in southern California where they don't give us any respect. We are 
considered children... they laugh at you if you say you are married at twenty 
years old." 
She continues explaining that her attitude towards life comes from having 
experienced things on her skin: "Since I was a little girl, my mother had to 
work, my father had to work, I had a little sister, I was always trusted ... and 
that is the best feeling I have ever had. So I learned the hard ways about a 
lot of things: first of all I had to take care of my sister ... pick her up from 
the 'asilo', (kindergarten), bring her home, when she was a baby, change her 
diapers, give her a bath, check the milk on your wrist, make sure that it's 
not too hot, and clean the house, do the dishes, 
whenever she comes home at night. And then I came 
skin on me also ... it was a war between myself and 
And she could not fight it for me, they could not 
were fighting their own war. So I reached a point 
myself and I. You have to conquer it. If you want 
it, you have to fight for it ... And I reached a point where if I want this, I'm 
going to get it, it's just the attitude I have, you know. I want it bad 
enough, I'm going to fight for it and nobody is going to tell me not to do it, 
no wayl ... I'll make sure I get it! I don't cheat in line and steal to do that, 
and I will never for anyone else... it's like to fight a battle for respect. 
Most people that come here the first time and say 'Is the owner here? or the 
person responsible for the restaurant,' and I say 'myself.' And they go 
'Really?' Ya, really, do you have a problem? What are you doing here if you 
don't like me? They run away, they kind of stood up and oh... In order for an 
adult, a bigger person than I am, to respect me I have got to smack them on 
the face real hard. When I smack them, they can smack me back, but they 
wouldn't do it...I learned in this restaurant how people humiliate me on the 
phone and things, and I learned the hard way ... they take advantage of your 
accent ... when you have an accent, you don't speak English too well, they 
always speak louder. Funny, but they do ... they think that if they speak louder 
you'll understand. I thought: that's very amazing, very interesting. Then I 
found that if you have an accent people feel that you don't know as much as 
you should know, and you actually know more than they will never know. I had 
people come in here once telling me 'it's illegal to do that.' I go: 
'Get out 
of my life! I'm taking legal classes and you are going to tell me this. The 
penal code says,' and I flip it around and they go 'oh well!'... Sometimes I 
and prepare dinner for my mom

get phone calls, people who don't know how to speak English. I mean, they are 
Americans, and they don't know how to speak English. I get very offended... The 
example I can think about is with a black person, that I respect, but they are 
hired and they don't teach them how to speak on the phone with people, and I 
get really mad at that. They call me and they go (she imitates a black 
accent): 'Excuse me ma'm, is you the owner?' And I go 'Is you the owner?' And 
they go on and I can't understand what they are saying. And I go 'Excuse me 
ma'm but I can't understand what you are saying.' 'Oh, I understand you have 
an accent. Where are you from?' And I go 'Call me back when you learn how to 
speak English! Thank you, and I hang upl... 'Is you the owner!' What the heck 
is that supposed to mean? I refuse to talk to people like that. I'm sorry. If 
you want to have an intelligent conversation with me you got to have somebody 
intelligent to speak to me..." I ask if she does not think that 'Is you the 
owner' is a dialect, and she says: "Yes it is their dialect ... but you are not 
supposed to speak dialect to start with when you are having a business 
relation on the telephone... It is like if I were in Italy and I started to 
speak my Venetian dialect to some kind of office management! What? That's very 
ignorant, I think. It's your dialect, whatever, it's wonderful. Unless you are 
in your own town, and you do that, that's fine. But don't come out to me and 
speak to me something I'll never understand or I refuse to understand! I'm 
Italian, I speak the Italian language. My dialect is something completely 
different. I'm in America, I speak the American language, their dialect is 
their own business!" 
She switches to Italian and tells me that when she went to Italy when she was 
seventeen she felt totally respected. People offered her expresso coffe, or a 
glass of wine, addressed her in the third person, and she felt honored. 
Something that you have to learn in this country, she says, is that you are 
considered a teenager, they don't respect you, and this is why in her opinion 
there are so many problems with teenagers in America. 
Roberta, the mother, tells me an episode that happened in school to Lara to 
show me that she always fought to be respected and always got the respect she 
wanted. The biology teacher spoke badly of Italian people in class and Lara 
reacted strongly to it. The mother went to the principal and asked him to do 
something about it. The principal supported them, but in the end they decided 
not to do anything about it, since the teacher was acting very nicely after 
that. The day after the episode Lara went to school with a T-shirt saying: 
"Kiss me. I am Italian." 
Toni and Franco come at the table and start telling a series of jokes. The 
first one plays on the phonetic resemblance between the English expression 
"five cents" and the Italian expression "fai sens(o)" which means "you make me 
sick." A guy goes to a store to buy something. When the seller asks for "five 
cents," the Italian replies: " e to fai schifo" which means: "you disgust me!" 
The juxtaposition of the innocent English sentence with the offensive Italian 
sentence provokes the humor. 
Toni goes on to tell another joke which can be understood only if one knows 
the 'funny' accent with which people from the city of Bari, in the southern 
region of Puglia, speak. one robber goes into a tobacconist's shop in New York 
owned by a Barese, a guy from Bari. He aims the gun at the guy and says "Kent" 
(a brand of cigarettes ). The Barese replies "Io nun saccho cantare", I don't 
know how to sing ("Kent" sounds like the imperative form of cantare, to sing, 
in the Barese dialect.)

Toni is definitely a good joketeller. Everybody laughs even if they have heard 
the jokes before from him. Encouraged by our laughter he goes on to tell a 
dirty joke, again in Italian. 
"There is a press conference in Hamburg. There is an American, a Frenchman, an 
Italian, and an Englishman, and they are talking about tall grandfathers. The 
Frenchman starts talking about his grandfather: he was so tall that he could 
go to get coffee from Paris to London with one step! The Englishman says "but 
this is nothing! My grandfather was so tall that when he had to sign a check 
for his petrolium in Saudi Arabia, he would just reach out with one hand! The 
American says that his grandfather was the tallest: he had to walk all curved 
because he was holding the moon and Mars on his back! The Italian asks: was it 
heavy? I know it must have been heavy, those were the balls of my 
grandfather!" 
Big laughsl he goes on to tell another joke. 
"There are American tourists touring Rome on a carriage. They arrive at the 
Altare della Patria and tell the Roman guide: this is nothing, in America we 
coilld build this in a week! The guide does not say anything. Then they arrive 
at the Foro Romano. They say: In America we could build this in five or six 
days! Then get to San Pietro and they say: this is a very small church, in 
America we would need two or three days at the most! The roman guide was 
already tired of this. They arrive at the Colosseo and they ask him: Excuse 
us, what is that? And the guide goes: What? That one? I don't know, I passed 
by here this morning and it wasn't here!" 
Lara goes on to tell another joke, on a similar theme: 
"There is an American who goes to a vegetable store in Italy and asks; What is 
this? And the greengrocer answers: these are oranges. The American goes: Ah, 
in America oranges are this big (making a big size with her arms.) What are 
these? These are potatoes: Ah, in America potatoes are this big! And he goes 
on, carrots, in America are this big. Then he points to a watermelon and asks; 
what is this? And the Italian goes: peas!!! 
T IAW-PT-A008=Geralyn Ciaramitaro (born in 1971) was named after her maternal 
grandfather, Gerolamo; her sister Mary was named after her paternal 
grandmother, Maria; her brother Dominic was named after his paternal 
grandfather, Domenico. 
Geralyn, called Jay by family and friends, came to the park to join her 
cousins and friends who are presently playing bocce. She was the activity 
director for the Italian American club and I ask her what her duties were. She 
says that before the club, Italians did not know eachother. Three years ago 
they started to spend time together, before then they did not know eachother 
well. "We wanted to get together so everybody could meet eachother and we 
could start doing things together. And then when we grew up we could have an 
Italian American club, you know, like the adults do .... The first time at 
meetings everybody came, you know, seventy people ...from 14, may be to 25 
years old ... most of them were single. A lot of things we could not get done, 
we were unable to do, so two years after that I decided I was going to do it 
no more, I got out of it... The boys can do whatever they want, because they 
are the boys! Right? Supposedly! Okay? But the girls, they are strict on, 
like: we cannot go dancing ... me and my sister we cannot go to the movies past 
eight o'clock..." 
She believes these restrictions come from the fact that her parents were born 
in Italy: "I know a lot of Italians whose parents were born here, and they get 
to do everything they want. Since they know what is like overthere, they bring 
it here..." She says that girls have more restrictions than boys: "Oh my God! 
When my brother was eighteen he got to do, okay, he got a graduation party and 
he got to go on a trip. When I was eighteen, I did not get a party, but that 
does not matter, but if I wanted to go on a trip, I could not. I had to go 
with the family, which is coming up soon." 
Jay recalls the only time when she got permission to go to Palm Spring for two 
days with her friends: "We were thirteen of us, all together, most of us are 
related... They let us go, I think, because we are all Italian, because they 
never let us go, you know, anywhere else, especially if there is no parents. 
The oldest person was 25,.but he is my cousin Jerry." 
Jay and her parents joke around the subject of getting married to a non-
Italian. Her father says: "If you do that, 'ti scannu'!" (sicilian expression 
that translates literally in 'I'll cut your throat'.) 
Jay has not visited Italy yet. She is supposed to go next year but she does 
not want to stay in Italy all the time, she wants to go to France, 
Switzerland, and Germany: "I don't think they like that either... If they want 
me to stay just in Italy I will not go!" 
Jay talks about her friends playing bocce. They are between 18 and 22 years 
old. The parents come to the park to play bocce every sunday. Jay's brother 
often comes to play with the adults. The younger group does not play 
regularly, they come down here when they have time, usually on saturdays. The 
adult men and women play separately: "They usually don't play with the guys, 
because the guys think they are wimpy, so the girls have their own game, the 
guys have their own game ... the younger people, see there are not as many of 
us, so we all play together." 
Jay learned when she was little. "Sometimes in the backyard... I'd see my dad 
play and I wanted to play, that's about it." 
She explains the game: "I never take score, because I get confused, but it's 
like: you play in groups of four, four people get the red, four people get the 
PT 
AOOFJ a 
black and you have to get close to the little ball... and then, I don't know 
how we do but I think we count how many fingers spaces between the ball from 
each person. Whatever ball is closest, we count a point for that 
team... probably we play an hour and then we start over, depending on who is 
losing, if it is a big lose, we start over." 
To measure the distance between balls they,use their fingers or feet. They 
usually speak English while playing but all the jokes, "anything that's funny, 
we say in Italian." 
Ken is taking a picture of the group. Jay screams to wait for her. After the 
picture they stop playing and everybody comes under the trees where the picnic 
tables are. 
I clip the lavalier to one of the boys, Salvatore who was born in Palermo and 
grew up in the town of Porticello. He says that there is a lot in common 
between the towns of Terrasini and Porticello, one east and the other west of 
Palermo. In both towns the fish industry is dominant. Salvatore came to San 
Pedro in 1973, when he was twelve years old. His family left Sicily for 
"family matters in the old country." "Actually we landed in New york, like 
Columbus did! (laughs). No, we stayed in New York for four months, but because 
the climate was different we moved overhere to San Pedro. San Pedro because, 
where we come from, Porticello, is very similar. The climate is the same and 
it's a fishing village also." His father (Mariano Crivello) was a fisherman in 
Sicily and in San Pedro continued to fish with his cousin. 
I ask where he learned English. "I learned it in school basically because that 
was the only choice I had. Because I came here, I came to find a lot of fellow 
Italians and so we hanged around together, we had a group and everything we 
did everywhere we went we spoke Italian. So it was very difficult to leran by 
doing that, it was all because of school. And then eventually it started 
fading out when we knew that we had to be good in English ... My parents' 
intention was to come here, try it out and go back ... we are a big family: five 
brothers and three sisters." 
At home they speak Sicilian: his parents speak always in Sicilians among 
themselves and with the children while the brothers and sisters mostly speak 
English among themselves. 
He introdeces me to his sister, Mary who was playing bocce too. 
I ask if they all Americanized their names. "I think the names, we Americanize 
them because, to make it comfortable among other people, especially Americans. 
It's kind of funny when you call someone with an Italian name, actually it 
depends on the name: Salvatore is kind of long, so people prefer to say Sal." 
"Everyone here, we have different groups of friends: we have American friends, 
and school friends, and working friends, but we also have ourselves and this 
is more like an original group." I ask if they mix these friends: "We do from 
time to time. It's hard because, I may feel uncomfortable to bring an American 
friend because he doesn't understand Italian and quite often we use Italian 
expressions to make fun of things or whatever.... For istance, you play bocce 
and... instead of saying 'go ahead, shoot the ball,' we say 'Dai, tira,' you 
know. Because here we try to maintain that little, that bit of original, of 
tradition, should I say. Because bocce, we started to play bocce not too long 
ago. It's an old people game, senior citizens play that, and we picked that up 
on them because it's fun and now everybody is into the habit of it and we use 
the same expressions they do, because we want to carry on the tradition. We do 
f 
T= ,4ao•, 3 
the same in soccer, we do the same in every other thing we do." 
The Italian soccer team is called 'Internazionale,' and plays every sunday. 
There are no women in the soccer team and joking Sal says: "we keep the 
tradition of female, like they are the females, they should stay home. No it's 
not true! I think this is the generation where we are breaking a lot of 
ground, things are beginning to change." A girl in the group says "We have 
more guys friends, before ... you had only girl friends. They used to say 'You 
don't have friends as guys. Either you like them or you don't have them.' Like 
my sister, she is twentyfive, when she was growing up, forget it..." Sal 
continues: "Today's twenty generation, twenty-twentyone year old people that 
are breaking new ground. 
I tell you that we are the last one, the 
twentyeight-twentynine who carry on the old tradition and now it's just 
changing, changing a lot." 
I ask what else they do that feels like they are carrying on the tradition. 
Sal says: "We do quite a few things: we get together from time to time, we 
play bocce. Of course we have the soccer team and we try to keep all Italians. 
It makes much more difference to play with other teams because we come on 
sunday and we talk about what's going on in Italy in the soccer league 
overthere. Everybody brings a little piece of news." 
on friendship Sal says: I think we all feel more comfortable being around 
eachother, Italian Americans, again because we can understand eachother's 
culture and if I have to say something to someone else..I know how to take it 
or they know how to take it because we know eachother really well. We know our 
background while if you spoke with an American fellow, then you'd better be 
more clear." 
Sal finished school two years ago. He works with computers. "I was the first 
one out of the family not to go into fishing...He (his father) was proud of it 
actually because he did not want my two oldest brothers to go either ... He 
knows how hard fishing is, he wanted us to have more decent jobs." 
Sal introduces me to Paolo Di Gerolamo, who came to the States with his family 
when he was one year old. His family came by ship through Ellis Island and 
then took the train to San Pedro where his grandfather (Dominic Ciaramitaro) 
had been for the past ten years. His father Gaetano di Gerolamo married 
Rosalia Ciolino. Paolo is not going into fishing. He says that some of his 
friends went into the fishing industry and he would have gone too if his 
father was not injured ten years ago and had to stop fishing. "I probably 
would have gone into fishing because by now he would probably have a fishing 
boat and all the combinations that everyone else has and I probably would be 
stuck on a boat. You know: son's owner, has to be working on the fishing 
boat." 
Another guy introduces himself. His name is Matteo, from the town of Trappeto, 
Sicily. He has a pendant hanging on his chest in the shape of Sicily, gift 
from his parents. 
I have two girls and two boys in front of me and I ask if they feel that they 
were treated differently by their parents while growing up. Everybody answers 
affirmatively. Mary starts to talk and I move the lavalier from Sal's to her 
shirt. Mary is fourteen. She says that her mom lets her go out, but she says 
that they would like to have the women home with mom all the time. Her parents 
PT-A00• q 
are more interested in her having a career. "My mom, she would be happier if I 
had a career instead of being a housewife right away, I know that." She helps 
her mother in the house a lot, and she is learning how to cook. Last summer 
her parents went to Italy and she took care of her smaller brothers at home. 
She tells me a couple of recipes for the tomato sauce and eggplant parmigiana. 
Another guy comments on the difference in strenght between men and women and 
tries to defend the attitude of parents toward the daughters: "You worry when 
they are out, you worry about things that might happen. Plus they (the 
parents) were young once too and they know how guys and girls ... guys try to do 
something with girls." 
Side 2 
Jay comments that her parents will not send her away to college. "They say 
they don't want me to be away from them because they want to watch me." Her 
brother, who went to college, choose to stay near the family but Jay is sure 
that if he wanted to go away the parents would have paid for his school while 
she knows that they would not pay for her. "Sometimes all of us regret being 
Italian, but then there is certain times, you know, like family gatherings, 
like Christmas, you say 'it's fun being Italian!' You know! (other people 
talk) ... a lot of times we just hate it, especially if you are a girl. Guys 
sure love it! ...American guys, they don't have traditions, they don't have 
family—American families are not as warm as Italian families." 
Mary compares her life with her friend's life. "...She can go out all night, 
it doesn't matter what time... she can have a boyfriend, I think, but compared 
to my mom! She wouldn't dare me have a boyfriend, probably not even when I'm 
sixteen...I call my friend's house and she is probably never home and she is 
not close to her parents. I always think about leaving my mom home, like 
before I go, I think 'oh oh, my mom be home alone! Maybe I should think about 
that, maybe I'll stay home this time. But my friend she 'd just leave, because 
she is not that close." 
Jay tells me that they spend all their holidays with family which could be 
from ten people to forty people. When they go on trips, they don't just go 
with family members, but with the "extended" family: "My mom would call her 
sisters and brothers and friends and—like we went to Las Vegas last weekend, 
we went eighteen people, all Italians, we just don't go little groups, 
neverl..,It's just fun, I don't know, that's when you like being Italian!" 
on sundays, most families have their "sunday pasta," when they have pasta con 
salsa: "You have to be home on sundays at twelve o'clock." "Sunday tradition 
is always the same, we always have tomato sauce with pasta." They don't eat 
breakfast or dinner, but only the big Italian lunch. Sal adds: "Sunday here, 
you cannot tell the difference between a sunday and a tuesday. We try to 
maintain that a sunday is a holiday." 
I ask if their families are religious: "They say they are," is one comment. "I 
think it's changed big time," is another. Jay says: "We like to go to church, 
and my parents don't." Another guy says: "It's funny when they first came 
here, my parents, my dad especially he went religiously every sunday, but 
then, as we grew up and everything," " I guess as they got Americanized they 
did not do it anymore." Everyone present has been baptized and confirmed. 
Somebody says: "You have to have that before you get married." "I think it's 
all the same but it's more liberal." Everybody goes to church, or tries to go 
-?7A9o(•F,S 
every sunday. They don't go to the Italian Mass but to the American Mass 
because they don't like the priest, they say. But tomorrow everybody is going 
to be at the Italian Mass at 5:15 (a special Mass officiated by an Italian 
priest visiting San Pedro). 
I ask about Saints' celebration. "We have San Giuseppe day. That's fun. All 
WAPS, all of us get together." Everybody laughs. "We get called waps, dagos." 
I ask about the D.B. club (dago bastards) but they have never heard of it. 
Jay tells about her grandmother's San Giuseppe and explains why she decided to 
have a celebration every year. I ask which roles do the girls play in the 
festivity and she says that her grandmother picks whoever she wants and 
usually picks girls outside of her family. Salvatore played San Giuseppe for 
the church celebration in 1978 when he was nineteen/twenty. 
Some of these youths are going to be at the Italian American club monday 
evening for the weekly meeting. They tell me it is scheduled for 6:00 but 
"don't come until 7:30, everybody comes late."

T IAW-PT-A009= 
Father De Dominici worked at Mary Star for the past 11 years. We decide to 
speak in Italian. I ask how the Italian community has shaped the church 
activities in San Pedro. 
They have three special sections of the Italian immigrants: the section 
spiritually more active is formed by the Ischitani; the other group is formed 
by the recent immigrants from Sicily (immigrated in the last thirty years). 
What counts for these groups is the celebration of the patron saints: San 
Giovanni Giuseppe della Croce, honored in august with a special prayer called 
"coronella" or "Coroncina." The celebration evokes the time when the relics of 
the saint were brought from Naples, where the saint died, to Ischia, where he 
was born. Father De Dominici has never been to Ischia; he directs me to the 
President of the Italian Catholic Federation, Filippo Mazzella, for more 
details about the saint's celebration in the old country. For this celebration 
they sing a special hymn, usually sang by a cantor whose mother was born in 
Ischia: this man never misses a celebration which is a family celebration for 
him as well as an act of religious devotion. 
The Sicilian group has formed a Sicilian association with their flag which is 
used for the procession of San Giuseppe 
held every year. The procession goes 
around the block and ends with the blessing of the table of san Giuseppe. To 
the celebration participates also another sicilian group of The Madonna del 
Lume. He says: "This is the way they show their devotion externally, in the 
typical Italian way." 
He talks about the altars in the church: there is an altar of the Sacro Cuore 
(The Sacred Heart); the altar of the Madonna del Perpetuo Soccorso (Our Lady 
of perpetual aid); the altar of Saint Anne (dedicated by the group called 
"society of the altar of Saint Anne" formed by women of Ischian and Neapolitan 
descent). 
He gives me a book published for the sixtieth anniversary of the church in 
which there is the history of this society. 
Only recently the Italian Catholic Federation was able to have a Mass in 
Italian every Sunday. However the attendance is not too high and De Dominici 
seems very disappointed. 
The third group is formed by people from Puglia (Colaruotolo is a typical last 
name from that region). However they are not "independent" as far as religious 
celebrations are concerned. Once there was also a group of people from Liguria 
(Castagnola is a typical last name from the region), and a few families from 
Piemonte. These regional groups were never too numerous and mix with the 
bigger Sicilian and Ischian groups for religious celebrations. 
I ask if he knows the story of the big migration from the towns of the 
province of Palermo (Trappeto, Terrasini, Partinico, San Vito to Capo, 
Castellamare del Golfo, Monreale, and others). He says that he does not know 
why there are so many families from that area. Recently he was called to bless 
the new house of one family from Trappeto. Blessing a new house is a very 
common practice among Sicilians. 
I tell De Dominici that people refer to the church as the church of the 
fishermen. He says Italian fishermen have made many offers to the church 
starting from the Di Massa family to the Di Carlo family ( who owned a bakery 
on Gaffey street) who made special offers to build some of the altars in the 
church. The statue of San Giuseppe Giovanni della Croce was donated by the 
Ischian group. The interior of Mary Star comes from Italy: all the altars, the 
statues, the mosaic works, the Via Crucis stations (the Stations of the 
Cross). 
Nine years ago, when the new liturgy after the Second Vatican Council 
wanted to modify the interior of the churches there were many pickets outside 
Mary Star. People who had contributed statues and objects of devotion to the 
church, afraid that things would have been, taken away, took home their own 
gifts to the church. Some returned them later, some kept them. In many 
churches the statues have been removed according to the new liturgy that wants 
the devotion to focus on Jesus and not on the saints. 
The names that Italians give to their children tend to be American names 
according to the priest. They are afraid to be ridiculized, he says. He 
baptized many Joseph, John, and Anthony. 
Mary Star was inaugurated in 1958 or 59. The land was bought by the Italian 
parish priest of the time: Massimo Benso from Piemonte. Father De Dominici 
comes from Piemonte too. He tells me briefly how he came to the States in 1954 
and how he had to face the total dominance of the Irish priests. 
I ask if there is any rivalry between the Ischitani and the Sicilians. He says 
that the Italian Catholic federation mediates between the two groups. 
Sicilians and Ischitani had to present their requests together in order to be 
heard by the diocesan curia of Los Angeles. 
I ask about funeral services. He says that he has to follow the liturgy and in 
his opinion Italian and American funarals are just the same. Vigil (veglia) 
cannot be done because of sanitary laws. Mortuaries in San Pedro are owned 
mostly by Irish people. 
I ask about pilgrimages organized by the church. He says that some travel 
agencien organize what are called "Catholic tours," but the church itself does 
not organize anything except for the pilgrimage to the Madonna of Guadalupe 
for the Mexican population of San Pedro.

TIAW-PT-A010=Interview continues from IAW-PT-A009. In Italian. 
I ask about Italian weddings. He says Italians spend thousands of dollars for 
weddings. Talking about the tradition of big celebrations he goes on talking 
about the Philippine traditions for funerals.

T IAW-PT-A011=Enez Rubino says she is over 65, a senior citizen. She was born 
in San Francisco. I ask her why she called us and wanted to talk to us. She is 
very interested in everything Italian and wants her parents to be remembered 
through a book or tapes. 
She shows me a picture of her family which was published on the special issue 
of the Pilot celebrating the centennary of,San Pedro. She was a hairdresser. 
Her mother used to call her in Calabrese dialect "spinnapidocchi" (lice-
picker), because when she was a young girl she used to have a woman come in to 
comb her hair and to her it was very degrading for her daughter to take up 
that profession. 
Her parents were born in Reggio Calabria. Her father came first to New York. 
Then, because of some trouble (?) went to Africa to work in the diamond mines. 
His wife, back in Italy did not hear from him for five years, she thought he 
was dead. Enez does not know how they got back together again, but at the 
beginning of the century he was in San Francisco and she joined him with 
Enez's sister, who was five years old at the time. In San Francisco Enez's 
brother was born, and another sister who passed away, then Enez. They moved to 
San Pedro where her younger brother was born. She does not know why her family 
went to San Francisco. She is happy that her family settled in California, 
especially in San Pedro that she loves particularly. She lived and worked 35 
years in West Los Angeles but decided to retire in San Pedro. 
Her father first owned a grocery store in San Francisco; then he started 
fishing but did not have too much luck fishing so came to San Pedro thinking 
that he would do better. But he did not do any better and started working in 
the lumber yard and as long as she can remember he worked there. 
Growing up she had to speak Italian: her mother did not speak English very 
well. They used to make fun of her. She would call the church "ghiorge," 
kitchen was "chikene." "She was a smart woman. She'd go out and buy property, 
and I'd go with her and interpret, without even telling my father! ... We used 
to say 'If she had a college education she would have been dangerous'!" 
Her mother came from a pretty well off family in Italy who used to loan money. 
Her father was adopted, so Enez does not know anything about his family. They 
do not have relatives back in Italy or in the States. The family will grow 
again through Enez's brother, who is a doctor, and has seven children and 
eleven grandchildren. "So the name will be carried on!" 
Enez does not speak Italian anymore but when she gets together with her 
brother's family they throw Italian words here and there. Her brother has a 
favorite word that he uses all the time to address people: "stunat" (stonato 
in Italian, which can mean "out of tune," or "bewildered, disturbed".) He gven 
put the word on his license plate. 
Enez's mother used to work in the fish canneries when Enez was young. After 
her last son was born she quit working. The family lived on sixth street and 
Cabrillo. "In those days we used to visit with people...I went every places 
with my mother. First place I had to interpret: any business or anyone got in 
trouble, I had to go ... anyway, we'd go visit these Italian families for the 
afternoon, and I remember three women in particular that we'd go and visit. 
But then at night, these people that were friends of ours from San Francisco, 
they would come to our house and visit us. They were Italians. But we used to 
have a lot of dinners, but they were American people. My mother used to wine 
4 
0 0 
and dine the people that worked in the lumber company, the bosses. She was a 
'apple polisher' we'd say. So my father would always have his job. She would 
always entertain them. And they used to love to come to our house because we 
used to make wine, and they drank wine and my mother would make a big 
pizza ... At Christmas time, I remember, she used to buy turkeys and in those 
days they did not take the feathers off and we'd have these live turkeys and 
we'd go to two of the bosses that I remember here in San Pedro and bring the 
turkeys ... and I said to her once: Gi, mom how come they get the turkeys and we 
don't? She says: Figlia mia (My daughter), this is how your father keeps 
working, she says." 
Enez was the one who spent more time with her mother and the family. She 
remembers the first turkey she cooked for the family for thanksgiving when she 
was fourteen. 
Her mother was noted for her ravioli in San Pedro. For a while, when Enez's 
father was not working she was selling the ravioli. Everybody in town must 
have eaten her mother's ravioli, she says. She also used to give them to the 
neighbors on Sixth street. 
"My father used to roll out the dough, he had this 
big heavy pipe ... and I remember I used to go with her to buy the meat, and we 
wanted two pounds of brains and they looked at me: brains? ... I used to be so 
embarassed sometimes when I'd ask for some of these things. And she'd put like 
beef, pork, veal, and the brains and the spinach...I can still see her today 
when she makes the dough... she had it in a big pan, she'd sit like this (she 
opens her legs), with her apron and she wore these long dresses ... the pan 
would be on the chair and she would be sitting on a chair. And then she'd make 
a well with the flour and break about two dozen eggs in this hole she'd made, 
and then she'd put the oil in and then she'd start kneading it. Then my 
father's job was to roll it. And then when they had made the ravioli, we used 
to have this big dining-room table with flour on the table and we'd put the 
ravioli. The next morning we had to turn them all over! We used to hate that, 
but that was our job (the kids' job) to turn them over so they dry on the 
other side." Today, Enez'9 sister-in-law makes ravioli for Christmas, 
following the old recipe. 
Enez remembers the sunday's smell of tomato sauce. Her father wanted some sort 
of maccheroni or pasta dish every night with his dinner. "Sundays, the 
morning, they would get up real early, and it started to smell like garlic all 
over! It smelled so good!" 
She remembers buying the baccala and stocafisso (stockfish, she calls it), and 
eating pasta with garbanzo beans and lenticchie (lentils), and "aglio a olio," 
oil and garlic. 
"See, these things, when I was growing up, they would embarass me because all 
my surrounding people, except for the neighbors next door, they were like 
Americans. They did not eat these things. I'll never forget when I was going 
out, we went to this real fancy restaurant in Beverly Hills, I was still 
living here, would you believe it? The side dish was pasta with oil and 
garlic! I could not believe itl Now everything that I was ashamed of when I 
was a kid but loved, it's very popular nowl ... If I was raised down there where 
all the Italians lived, I would not think anything of it, but I was like 
overhere by myself." 
Enez's mother bought property. She used to tell her daughter: "Keep the man 
broke and buy property and you will always have something." Enez says that she 
bought houses for her children. "That was her idea, to leave her children 
something." 
Side 2 
"We used to always say that my mother could squeeze a buffalo 
out of a nickel. She just knew, and I'm a good shopper too, I got a lot of 
that from her, she just knew how to shop: where the sales were; ...in those 
days we did not have a car, so we walked! So we went to all the stores that 
was the cheapest and that's how she did it. And we did not have a lot of 
clothes either. In other words, we did not even have a radio until way, way 
later when most people had radios ... We owned a house when most people didn't 
own a house!" 
Enez continues to talk about her mother's "entrepreneurial" activities: "we 
owned this house and then besides that house she build a little house for my 
sister when she got married. A one bedroom attached to the big house. And then 
during the depression, we used to have chickens and all kinds of peach trees 
in the backyard and everything, well, she got rid of all that staff and she 
build a duplex in the back! And I remember I was graduating from junior high 
and I came home crying and I say 'nobody came to my graduation,' and she says 
'dear daughter,' and she was helping carrying off the junk from what they torn 
down to build these duplexes... 'I'm trying to build a future for you,
, she was 
saying to me, and I remember she was getting 35 dollars a month for rent. They 
are still there, they are nice apartments...I remember my father cementing 
everything and I used to help him. I hate to say this, but he and my brother, 
they would fight all the time so I was always the one who did everything!" 
They all helped the father making wine in their cellar. They used to buy the 
grapes from Di Miglio, whose nickname was "U previti,"(the priest). "Everybody 
had a nickname here in San Pedro ... My mother used to give everybody a 
nickname! I remember my brother had a tall, skinny friend and she used to call 
him "lu citrolo," (the cucumber). This couple from San Francisco, that used to 
come and visit, I don't know why she called them "the Babbiti," I think 
because one of them stuttered... She used to call me 'la papera,' (the duck) 
because I used to be fat ... but she always called me 'Enezella,' so that was 
very endearing." 
Enez was named after a woman that lived near her mother in San Francisco. Enez 
is glad that her mother did not name her Mary or Rosy. Her sister's name is 
Mimi and her brother's name is Tony. The last brother was called Peter because 
he was born in San Pedro. 
Enez's family used to always have people over in the evenings. She recalls 
that sailors would come to her house and sit around and tell stories. "I used 
to be fascinated by listening to all this." 
I ask if she heard stories of her parents' trip from Italy: "The only thing I 
remember is when my mother and sister got to ellis Island. My sister had to go 
to the bathroom very badly and neither one spoke any English, and they were 
alone and couldn't make anyone understand. So my mother said 'go here,' so my 
sister went right there!" 
Her father used to tell her about Africa and working in the diamond mines, but 
she does not remember any of that. 
I ask if her mother put aside money to buy the trousseau for the daughters. 
She says that her mother never bugged them about getting married. They never 
pushed about marrying an Italian, and they never made a big deal about Enez's 
divorce. Enez's first husband was english and her second husband was Italian: 
Scaramucci. She did not take her second husband's name, because people had 
trouble understanding it. When she got the divorce she reverted to her first 
husband's name: King. 
She tells how she became a hairdresser. her mother wanted her to go to 
college, but she would have preferred to wgrk at the fish cannery because 
everybody else was working there. But her mother did not want her to work 
there. 
Her mother was very religious, she says. She used to go to church every sunday 
and holidays and made her kids go too. When they got older, nobody went. Her 
father never went to church. He used to tell the kids a story which made fun 
of priests, and the mother would get mad. Enez went to catholic school; she 
did not like it because everybody else in her neighborhood went to public 
school. One year she decided on her own to go to public school without telling 
her parents! 
She does not remeber going to religious processions, but remembers the 
fishermen's fiesta for which she was elected princess once. I ask about her 
weddings and she shows me her photo album. There are pictures of her when she 
was in the contest for the fishermen's fiesta. On one of the pictures there is 
her name spelled with an E, Enez (in Italian would be Inez). She tells me that 
her sister changed the spelling when enrolled her in school because otherwise 
people would have mispronounced her name. Enez won the contest the year that 
people voted for her. Later, when in order to win you were supposed to sell 
tickets, another girl won because her father bought a lot of tickets! She 
shows me pictures of her family and of her first wedding. I ask if she got any 
money, some sort of dowry when she got married. She says that her mother gave 
her some money but not a big amount. "She was buying propertyl" she says. The 
children received a inheritance when she died.

T IAW-PT-A012=Continues from IAW-PT-A011 
I ask about the wedding shower. Enez did not have one when she got married; it 
wasn't very popular when she got married. 
We continue to go through the photo album.,There are some pictures of the old 
church on Ninth street where she celebrated her second marriage. Family 
pictures are mixed with pictures of friends, parties, and men in the show 
business that she used to date when she moved to Los Angeles after her first 
divorce. 
A picture shows the lace that her mother used to make at the "tombolo," (lace-
pillow): "She made a bedspread for all of us. It took her five years to make 
each one... she made some curtains for my sister. I used to make the patterns 
for her, when they get old I'd transfer them on cardboard." Enez learned to 
make only a simple flower at the tombolo; she says it was too complicated. Her 
mother was taught by the nuns in her home town in Calabria. When her mother 
died there was still a piece of lace on the lace-pillow that she was working 
on. Enez took that and brought it to the mortuary to put her head on it "so 
she had something to go with her." 
She tells me how sixth street, downtown San Pedro, used to be when she was 
growing up. "Everybody knew everybody." She is happy that her brother, the 
doctor, has his office on sixth street, only two blocks from where they used 
to live, even if everything is changed now. 
TIAW-PT-A013=Interview in Italian. 
looking at the pictures of the exposition 
Grace and I are in the din ing-room, 
 
of her daughter's trousseau. In Palermo the custom is that before a girl gets 
(she uses the words as 
m arried the mother gives the dowry or trousseau 
 
synonyms). In Sicily on the invitation that you send to the guests you also 
write the days during which the trousseau will be exposed. Usually it is 
exposed one or two weeks before the wedding.ceremony for two or three days. 
The guests go visit and bring a present, either a gift or money. Grace goes 
ning what she exposed: the re arergeBe O andh 
through the pictures expl ai 
shoes 
towels, night -gowns , and negliges. The new dresses, hats, pu 
that Grace bought for her daughter were exposed on life-size dummies. Grace's 
husband made some wood stools which Grace covered with colored tissue-paper: 
on top of these are arranged hand-embroidered tablecloths and sheets in a 
fashion that gives prominence to the embroidery. Most of the trousseau was 
bought in Italy by Grace during her last trip ten years ago, in 1979. She 
bought the "biancheria," (table, kitchen, and bed linen) not only for Mary, 
her oldest daughter, but also for the other two daughters, for whom she is 
planning to do the exposition too. She did not buy the same amount of 
trousseau for her son, but she has linen for him too. In fact she has already 
sent a bedspread to his fiancee. 
The trousseau was exposed in the living-room. From the curtains hang blanquets 
(10 of them) and bedspreads. This exposition did not replace the shower party. 
Grace invited relatives and friends. American friends were astonished because 
they had never seen something similar before. Nobody else in San Pedro had 
done a trousseau exposition before. Grace says that she wanted to do it 
because she does not want to lose the Italian tradition. After she did it, one 
of her sisters-in-law decided to do the same for her daughter and borrowed the 
stools that Grace used. Grace hopes to be able to do it again for her 
daughters when they get married. She says that it is a lot of work but it is 
worthed: her mother and her relatives cried and said that it was like being 
back home, in Sicily. 
Grace was born in Sicily and came to America when she was fifteen years old. 
She based the exposition for her daughter on the memory of the expositions she 
witnessed back in Sicily. 
The trousseau was composed of 25 pairs of sheets, between the "good sheets," 
(lenzuola buone) and the everyday ones, or as she says, the American ones there 
Among the good ones there were some that belonged to Mary's grandmother, 
were some with a Neapolitan embroidery, some made at the tombolo (lace-
pillow), and some with the Venetian embroidery. I see in the pictures some 
rugs: Grace tells me that she even bought the rugs for the bathroom. Aprons, 
pot-holders, and kitchen towels were included. She also exposed the silverware 
sets in silver and gold that she bought for her daughter. She also paid for 
the bedroom furniture, as a present for her daughter's shower, while the 
mother-in-law paid for the living-room furniture. Her daughter basically got 
everything she needed to start her own household. She worked as a dental 
assistant until she had her second baby. Now she is not working but plans to 
go back to work soon since they are building their new house and they need the 
money. Grace says that the house they are building is going to be Italian 
style: bricks, marble, balcony.

hall and dinner (pranzo). For the dinner Grace wanted to add something Italian 
so she cooked lasagne and cannoli for everybody and asked the waiters to serve 
it for dinner together with the regular dinner that they were serving. For her 
shower her daughter received many presents that she chose in local stores 
(Grace Italianizes the word "store" and says "storo"). The day of the wedding 
the Sicilian tradition is to give money: her daughter received fifteen 
thousand dollars as wedding gifts. 
"I Siciliani qua, i soldi vanno assai. Americani! sentono queste cose a si 
ritirano. voi siete ricchi allora! (Sicilians here spend a lot of money for 
weddings. Americans comment that sicilians are rich!)" Even Italians from 
other regions of Italy who participated to the wedding commented that not even 
rich Americans could afford what Sicilians spend for a wedding. 
I ask Grace if they run into debt for this wedding. She says that they did not 
have to because they saved money in advance. 
While the American tradition requires the bride to pay for the wedding, the 
Sicilian tradition requires the bride and groom's families to share the 
expenses. The bride and groom pay only for the photographer, all the rest is 
taken care by the families. 
Now that Grace's only son is going to get married in Canada, Grace is already 
thinking to have a party in San Pedro for all the relatives and friends 
(commari) who are not going to be at the wedding in Canada. In addition to her 
share of the wedding expenses, she is willing to pay for another "small 
wedding" in San Pedro. 
The family is getting ready to go to Canada this summer for the engagement 
party. For the engagement they have green-colored confetti (the sugared 
almonds). The color green symbolizes hope (hope to get married). The bride-to-
be is going to be dressed in green too. People bring small presents, but most 
presents consist of money. For her daughter's engagement she says that she 
limited the invitations to the close family and a few commari (friends): only 
200 people! Her daughter received five thousand dollars in money plus the 
gifts. 
The girl that Grace's son is going to marry was born in Canada, near Toronto, 
from a family of Sicilian immigrants. Her mother was born in Terrasini like 
Grace: they lived only two blocks away in Terrasini. The boy and girl met in 
San Pedro when the girl was visiting her aunts and uncles. She came recently 
to San Pedro to choose her engagement ring. 
The wedding of Grace's daughter ended up costing thirtyfive thousand dallars. 
The two families split the costs. The bride and groom received thirty thousand 
dollars in presents: with that money they bought their first house. Now they 
resold the house, made money out of it, bought some land and are building
, 
their new house. 
Side 2 
Grace offers me coffee and home-made cookies. 
I ask how the two families involved in the wedding talk about it and arrange 
the division of duties before hand. She says that her son-in-law asked 
permission to date Mary in the real Sicilian way: "the first day that he 
wanted my daughter he came here to ask us. Because I did not let my daughter 
out at all, really. He said, you know that I like your daughter since we were 
going to school, with your permission I would like to go out with her once, 
just to talk about it. My husband said, you know that we are Italian, he is 
Italian too, he comes from Mazara del Vallo, he came here when he was 
fourteen, while my daughter was born in America. So my husband said: you know 
that we are Italian and we use 'Italian style,' no 'American style,' that we 
go out and then you bring her back any time. No, in my house we don't use 
that. He really followed his orders." When they went out on their first date 
he took her back at the time decided by Mary's father. Then he introduced his 
mother to the family, brought her over and since then they became like family. 
She says that they always agreed about things and decided everything about the 
wedding together. 
Grace paid for the engagement party, and she was supposed 
to pay for her shower party too. But she asked the boy's mother if she would 
have liked to participate in the shower and share the expenses, and she 
agreed. 
I ask if Grace's husband let her spend all the money she wanted and she says 
that in their household they use the Italian way: the husband gives her all 
his money and she "does everything." 
She talks more about the exposition of the trousseau. She says that she kept 
the trousseau exposed for a week because she was waiting for one of her 
cousins from Detroit and wanted her to see it. It was an occasion that Grace 
likes to remember and talk about. She says "it was a joy, every evening people 
came and I offered coffee, cannoli. First I explained everything and then they 
would come to the table ... people came and went. It was like an open house." I 
ask if it was Mary who asked for the exposition. She says that she wanted to 
do it herself and that Mary let her do what she liked. "People told me, here 
you have staff to marry three daughters, not one!" 
When she came back from Italy with the items of the trousseau she stored it in 
several chests. When it was time to give Mary her share, she called her three 
daughters and in front of them she divided the items evenly. 
The involvement of the mother in the wedding of a son is definitely less than 
her involvement in her daughter's wedding. However Grace already gave her 
future daughter-in-law a gold bracelet which she is going to give her for the 
engagement. "But this is just a personal gift, for her. I think I'm going to 
give them money too, so that they can open a bank account overthere and put 
there all the money they receive for the engagement." She is also going to buy 
for them either the living-room or the bedroom furniture. They usually buy 
Italian furniture in a Los Angeles import store. She shows me the furniture in 
her house which are all Italian. 
Grace came to San Pedro in november 1957. She says that her father came here 
two years before the family because of the opportunities that America offered. 
He was a fisherman and boat owner in Sicily, and he was doing fine, but his 
brothers here in San Pedro convinced him to come. Grace's husband is from her 
same town, Terrasini. She says that they would love to go back to Italy, to 
visit, more often, but it is too expensive. The last time she went back was in 
'79 for "la festa dei morti," All Souls' Day. 
She tells me the story of her large family: her grandfather sent two of his 
children to Detroit when they were young and this is why part of her family is 
still today in Detroit. One of her uncles came to San Pedro to fish and since 
then other members of the family from Terrasini have come to work as 
fishermen. Her father was the youngest of the family. During his first two 
1-/f013/q 
years in San pedro he stayed with his brother and fished with him. Then he 
bought a house in San Pedro in the early sixties for 18.000 dollars. When his 
family arrived from Italy found the house already furnished (she says 
"fornitura" for furniture). Grace was sent to school for three months but she 
wanted to get 
a job, because she was engaged with an Italian boy back in Sicily and wanted 
to put together enough money to go back to Sicily and marry this guy. Instead 
she met her present husband, and changed her plans. 
Grace's son comes in. I ask if he is happy to marry an Italian American girl. 
He says "my mother is happier than me!" Grace says "it's nice because in this 
way you never end the Italian tradition." 
I ask Grace about food traditions in her household. She says she cooks Italian 
everyday. "In my house pasta cannot be missing on a daily basis." When her 
husband is fishing she cooks pasta a little less, but when he is home there is 
pasta every dinner. Every sunday they have a big lunch with pasta and tomato 
sauce.

Grace talks about food traditions in her household . She taught her daughters 
to cook. They like Italian food. They usually help her cooking when she has 
people over for dinner, otherwise Grace is in charge of everyday's cooking. I 
know she is famous in town for her cookies,called "cuccidata," which she makes 
for Christmas (she demonstrated how to prepare these cookies at the San Pedro 
Traditions festival last february.) Another kind of cookies that she prepares 
once a year for Saint Joseph are called "sweet ravioli" made with ricotta 
cheese and ground garbanzo beans mixed with sugar , honey, cinnamon , chocolate 
and milk. The mixture is put inside the dough and then either baked or fried. 
She gives me the recipe for the Saint Joseph's pasta that they cook at her 
mother's house before the festivity . They cook all kinds of legumes: peas, 
white and red beans , lentils, fava beans , garbanzo beans, and broccoli and 
fennel and then pour these on fresh taglierini (a kind of linguine ). As an act 
of devotion everybody is served a dish of this pasta. No meat is cooked for 
Saint Joseph. Other vegetables are: fried artichokes , potatoes, eggplant, bell 
peppers and onions . Different kind of fish is also cooked. For her own private 
act of devotion to Saint Joseph Grace cooks the sweet ravioli she talked 
already about and sometimes she makes "spingi," also called "zeppole," another 
kind of cookies made with flour and eggs, fried in oil, and dipped in sugar 
and cinnamon . She decided to make these cookies because her mother does not 
have time to make these cookies which require a long time and also because 
nobody else knows how to make them so well. She has always cooked these 
cookies since the first time her mother started the Saint Joseph's 
celebration. 
Her mother is in charge of the bread . She usually makes 300/400 rolls. She 
starts baking bread a week before the celebration and freezes it. The bread is 
made in different shapes and every shape is a symbol: Saint Joseph's stick, 
Jesus's crown, the cross.'The priest blesses the bread. Everybody 
participating in the celebration receives a small roll, an orange and a lemon. 
The rolls have a cross on them. 
She tells me how her mother started this act of devotion to saint Joseph. I 
ask if she has ever played the role of the Madonna in the procession . She says 
that the Madonna must be played by a young girl, a virgin. There are other two 
people that Grace knows who celebrate Saint Joseph at their house . One of them 
started because of the sickness of her son; another one continued the 
tradition that her mother started a long time ago. 
Grace's sister, the one that had the baby after her mother's pray to Saint 
Joseph, helps building the altar. Grace describes how the altar is built with 
three tables of different sizes. The tables are covered with blue embroidered 
tableclothes . Blue is the color of Saint Joseph : Grace, her mother , and her 
sisters dress in blue also. The family decides who is going to play the roles 
of Saint Joseph , 
Mary, and Baby Jesus in the procession . This past year a 
young cousin visiting from Italy was chosen to play the role of Mary: "It is a 
good omen. My daughters never wanted to do it. But they participate in the 
celebration, they don't even go to school that day." 
She continues decribing the celebration: before eating, the priest, Saint 
Joseph, Mary, and Baby Jesus are presented with a jug of water to wash their 
hands. Then they sit at a round table and are served food while everybody else

watches them and sings Italian church songs (she sings one of the songs for 
me). Then everybody starts to eat. Near the altar they put a ribbon and a 
book: people put money donations and write their names in the book. The money 
is counted (last year they made 800 dollars); Grace's mother keeps enough 
money to pay for her expenses and the rest is sent to charitable organizations 
in Italy. The leftovers are given to the needy families of San Pedro. 
Grace describes the bigger Saint Joseph's celebration held at the church every 
year. She says that the people in charge of it are Sicilian families that used 
to have a celebration at their homes before. In the last five /six years it has 
become easier to organize celebrations in the church. 
When Grace arrived in San Pedro went to school for three months. Then she went 
to work in Redondo Beach for a sewing factory where she worked two years with 
other Italian women. When she got married, she was 17 years old, she quit 
working to take care of her household and children.

At the wedding of Grace's daughters were invited 550 people. She tells me the 
menu for the reception that was held in a hotel in Los Angeles. The Tony Di 
Bruno band played Italian music and people danced. 
Jay, her daughter, is going out for a Chinese dinner. Grace says that her kids 
go out when their father is not home. But she says: "We still do things the 
Italian way, for example, they must be home by a certain time. We still have 
the mentality of thirty years ago, of when we came. We are afraid. I trust my 
kids, but I tell them to come home early." 
She tells me more about the food traditions for Christmas. They make 
"pignolata", cookies shaped in the form of a pine cones. The family celebrates 
every holiday together. If they celebrate Christmas day at the parents' house, 
then one sister invites everybody for Christmas' Eve, another one celebrates 
New Year's Eve at her house. For Christmas' Eve and new Year's Eve they cook 
only fish: baccala, either baked or "apparecchiato," with a sauce of vinegar 
and cappers, pine nuts and olives; crabs and prawns; shark, accompanied by 
salad and vegetables. 
She says that her family is very close. They hear from each other or visit 
each other almost everyday. She compares her family life in San Pedro with the 
life that her relatives in Detroit live. They work a lot, she says, and do not 
find the time to visit the family every day. 
"They live too far apart from 
eachother. Instead here in San Pedro we live a life that doesn't seem like we 
are in America, it seems we are in Sicily, because we are always 
together... Women don't work... especially paesani, we don't work. We have a lot 
of work at home." For a while Grace was making and selling cookies and 
pastries for weddings and parties. Recently she has not been feeling too good, 
so her husband told her not to do it anymore. 
I ask if they celebrate birthdays. In her family, since her husband is often 
away fishing, they don't celebrate birthdays too much. But she says it depends 
on the families. 
For Easter, she recalls what they used to do in Sicily: all the engaged men of 
the town try to lift a big olive branch, as big as a tree, decorated with 
TT-401 -L/, 
3 
ribbons and cookies. It's like a contest, during which all the young men try 
to hold the branch for the longest time. The one who wins gets a prize. In 
Detroit they have this Easter celebration. Grace says they they are trying to 
do it in San Pedro too, perhaps next year. In Detroit they cook lamb, and also 
have "semenza," (sunflower seeds) and other kinds of roasted seeds that she 
calls "calia," which are put in paper conep for people to buy. She tells me 
that the Italian American club is also trying to have permission to celebrate 
San Peter's day, the 29 of June, and have a big procession and "festa." She 
says that they need the permission from the town of San Pedro because in order 
to have a big procession they would need to close the streets, and this seems 
difficult to obtain. She asks me if our group (the Library) could put some 
pressure on the city to help obtaining these permissions. I tell her that I 
doubt it, but that I will tell my colleagues about this wish for more 
celebrations felt by the Italians. 
I ask Grace which saint she prays to when her husband is fishing. She tells me 
she is a devotee of Saint Anthony. Her first baby was born the day of Saint 
Anthony. She says that Jesus and the Madonna are okay, but she "prefers" the 
saints.

T IAW-PT-A015=Neal (Aniello) DiLeva was born in Ischia in 1945, right after the 
war. It was really bad in those days and all the Italians were coming to San 
Pedro. Many Italians had already come in the early part of the century, but 
the latecomers came after the war, like his father. Some of the first people 
from Ischia came to San Pedro in the 1890s, but the fishing people he says, 
came in the early 1900, like 1910/15. His father was a fisherman. Two of his 
brothers were fishermen in San Pedro. The family has many relatives in the 
fishing industry. His uncle was the head of the Pan Pacific canneries for many 
years. He was called "Red" because of his red hair. He was one of the big 
organizer of the San Giovanni Giuseppe committee in San Pedro. 
Neal arrived in San Pedro in 1957 with his sister, younger brother, and 
mother. His older brother came with his father in 1956. They left Italy on the 
Christopher Columbus ship, sister-ship of the Andrea Doria. They stayed with 
relatives in New York for a week. He says that there were a few groups of 
cousins in New York who were like "the greeters" for all the Ischitani who 
came to San Pedro. The relatives showed them New York and then gave them a bag 
full of food and fruits and told them not to buy anything on the train. "They 
wanted to make sure that we had enough staff with you to last you three 
dayal ... as we got closer to Los Angeles the food ran out and we were too 
embarassed to go to the dining room, we did not know what to say, so my mother 
was trying to buy something and somehow the porter understood that we wanted 
to buy bread. The thing is: we never saw American bread before, sliced bread! 
This is bread? I mean! You were used to seen loafs of bread. We ate it because 
we were hungry." At the central station in Los Angeles his father and older 
brother were waiting for them. 
The family lived on 8th street for a couple of years. 
A lot of Ischitani lived there. They did not have to go far to communicate in 
Italian. They used to go to Italian stores (Al grocery) but also to American 
stores: they would go in groups and never felt they needed an interpreter. 
Neal started to learn English by watching t.v. In school they were put in 
"foreign adjustment English" classes. The teacher did not speak English but 
the kids were encouraged to bring things from their countries and talk about 
them. That helped, he says, she was a great teacher. His mother never learned 
English. 
Neal's father worked on a boat owned by his brother. The crew was composed by 
men who all knew each other from Ischia. Before coming to the States his 
father went to Argentina in the late forties, but it did not work out. Neal's 
mother went to Argentina last year to visit her three sisters that she hadn't 
seen for almost fifty years. Neal's father, whose name was Antonio, died in 
1966, at the age of 60. Two of his sons, Jerry and Vince are fishermen on the 
Santa Maria, the Di Bernardo's boat. Neal's wife, Anna, is a Di Bernardo (she 
comes into the room). 
Neal and Anna met at the Olimpia soccer game which the 
Italian American club originated in the early sixties. 
Neal went to school. He tried to get into architecture, but could not get in 
so he opted for mechanical engineering. Today he is a mechanical engineer 
technician for the Long Beach shipyard. He was a supervisor for a while but 
now, because of a reduction in the work force, he lost his title. He started 
to work there when he was twenty years old. His father was proud of Neal's 
white collar job. He did not show to Neal that he was proud, but he knows he 
was from what other people have told him. 
When the family came, and Neal was 12 years old, after school he worked at the 
fish market. He used to make wooden boxes to put the fish in. "we all went 
through the fish market route ... my other uncle, on my mother's side he used to 
own all the fish markets. My uncle Red ... even these days, his kids own the 
fish markets ... Cigliano, my mother's side is Cigliano." 
His two brothers have been fishermen for twentyfive years. Their kids are not 
going into fishing. "Unfortunately the art of fishing will be lost ... You can 
forget about it. The next generation, you are not going to find any 
fishermen." 
Anna's father, Pasquale Di Bernardo worked on the Santa Maria, but then he 
left and worked at another shipyard for thirty years. 
Neal says of himself that he was one of the first ones who broke away from 
fishing. Most people of his age went into fishing. 
We talk about the video of Saint Giovanni Giuseppe della Croce, patron saint 
of Ischia, which they are going to show me. The saint was born in 1654 in 
Ischia, and he was proclamed saint in early 1800. The Ischitani all over the 
world, whether in San Pedro or Argentina, he says, all have a feast to honor 
the saint. At the beginning of august in San Pedro people who belong to one of 
the committees for the saint's celebration go around and knock at every 
Italian door to collect money to send to Italy. In Italy the money is used to 
pay for the band and fireworks for the feast. People go around collecting 
money not only for San Giovanni Giuseppe but for many other saints. Next month 
Neal is going to collect money for the Lady of Pompei: as far as he can 
remember, for the past fifty or sixty years they have been sending money to 
the orphanage in Pompei. People from different towns collect money for 
different saints: Saint Anthony, Saint George and the money is always sent 
back to the respective churches or organizations in Italy. " We all know each 
others and we all donate back and forth. This is done even in other parts of 
California, in other parts where Italians live. It's 'collecting money for the 
saints,' they call it ... Some people think that that's a thing of the past, 
that should be stopped, we don't want to be bothered sending money and so 
forth, but, you know they say they have the money overthere, why do they need 
our money? But some people feel that when they give the donation is like, they 
are giving a gift to God or to the saint." 
The Italian Catholic Federation has used San Giovanni Giuseppe della Croce to 
name the local brench of ICF. Once a year they have a "tridium" a three-day 
celebration at the end of august. Thursday and friday night they have a Mass 
during which a preacher tells the life of the saint and during which they say 
the "Coroncina," a special prayer for the saint. Then on saturday they have a 
Mass in the morning and a procession. Five years ago they were able to restore 
an old statue of the saint which had been in San Pedro for over eighty years 
but was not used recently because the church in which the statue was, was 
condemned and the new church did not have room for this old statue. An old 
Italian lady took the statue to prevent its destruction in the early sixties 
and made a little shrine in front of her house. When this lady died the family 
did not know what to do with it and called Neal's brother-in-law, Pasquale Di 
Bernardo and asked to take the statue and do something with it. So they ask 
ICF to pay for the rejuvenation of the old statue and they introduced the 
statue in the three-days festivity and procession. Neal's father-in-law, Pat 
Di Bernardo built a wooden-stand for it, a flower arrangement around the 
?T4vis,3 
crown, and a candelabrum in front of the statue. The statue is very heavy, so 
they cannot go around the block but limit the procession to the parking lot of 
the church, but "at least it brings memories back of years past when it was 
done many years ago by the first Italians that came here." Every year they try 
to improve it. This year they are going to have music in the parking lot. Then 
they follow up with a dinner-dance at night which usually is attended by 400 
people. They have a barbecue-steak dinner, and Italian music (tarantella and 
Neapolitan songs). 
I tell Neal that I got the impression that a lot of celebrations started in 
San Pedro five or six years ago and that I was wandering if something happened 
at that time that made Italians wanting to have more occasions to get together 
as a community. 
He says that his father-in-law and himself just decided one day to do 
something about the statue. He knows that many years ago in San Pedro there 
was a big celebration and a big procession when they used to close off the 
streets and parade around town, just like in Italy. But as the years went by, 
there were restricted in what they could do, for istance, they couldn't close 
off the streets anymore. He goes on telling me that not only they rejuvenated 
the statue of San Giovanni Giuseppe but also the statue of Saint Anne, which 
is today in the auditorium of the church and is taken care of by the Saint 
Anne's society, another Italian organization formed by women. "These aren't 
just statues, they represent certain things that happened the last seventy or 
eighty years. When a person looks at them, memories come back. So it isn't 
just you are carrying a piece of clay or marble, you are carrying a lot of 
things, you are carrying, symbolizes the many people that looked at the statue 
and what it stood for. The processions and different rituals that the Italians 
have symbolize these things. We're trying just to show where we come from, 
that's all, and what our ancestory did and so forth and that we are God loving 
people. We love the church, we love the people, we like to have a good time 
too." 
He starts the video of San Giovanni Giuseppe della Croce's celebration held at 
Mary Star last year on august 27th. It starts with images from the morning 
when people set up the tables for coffee and doughnuts in the auditorium, 
before Mass starts. The statue of fan Giovanni Giuseppe is decorated and ready 
for the procession. Every year different people ask to be the carriers of the 
statue in the procession. I ask if people have to pay some money to carry the 
statue. He says that there is no money involved: "These are all people that we 
all know, they are fishermen, really people devoted to the saint." Usually the 
officers of ICF are in front of the statue together with the knights of 
Columbus. The images move to the interior of the church where the statue of 
San Giovanni Giuseppe is also decorated. His wife was telling me before that a 
lot of money is spent for the flowers to decorate it. 
The video shows the beginning of Mass: while people sing in Italian a song 
which speaks of Ischia and the saint, the procession walks up the aisle of the 
church. The Italian and American flags are carried by young kids in the 
community, while the ICF banner is carried by the president, Phil Mazzella. 
All the ICF members follow them; then the Knights of Columbus, then the priest 
and finally the statue which is carried to the altar. The ICF banner is put in 
front of the statue and the two flags at the sides, then the lights are lit 
around the crown of the saint and the Mass starts. The church is full of 
people. Neal tells me that many Ischitani go back to Ischia in the summer and 
stay until september when the saint's celebration is held. In Ischia because 
?-T-,4o15, 
of the tourists, the celebration has been moved to september, 
Pedro is celebrated on the original date. 
This year the statue will be carried by four young fishermen, 
kids. Neal gives me some of the names of Italians from Ischia 
Costa, Di Bernardo, Di Leva, Di Meglio, Buono, Di Iacono, Lauro, Amalfitano, 
Onorato, Esposito, Mazzella, De Girolamo. They are unique last name from the 
island, he says. 
While the video shows moments of the Mass I ask how they named their children. 
Neal says that in Italy you always have to name the first kid with your 
father's name. So his oldest daughter was named after his mother: Lisa 
(originally Elisabetta) and as middle name she got her mother's name: Anne. 
Then his son had to be named after his father, so he named him Anthony. Then 
the third came and "it was my wife's turn: he was a boy so I had to name him 
after my wife's father. His name is Pasquale, we did not want to name him 
Pasquale, it's Pat, so we name him Patrick. Patrick and Pasquale are two 
different things, but it's close enough, it works, don't you think? ... We did 
our best: we didn't name him Rodney or anything like thatl But a lot of people 
don't do that, they would break away. They'll use catholic names but they 
won't be after their (relatives)." 
while in San 
the Onorato 
in San Pedro: 
The video shows some moments of the Mass and then the exit of the statue from 
the church. From the church they carry the statue to the auditorium through 
the parking lot. People around the statue are concerned that the statue is 
going to hit against the walls. It's a very heavy statue and Neal shows some 
concern for it: "Can you imagine if something happens in church?l" 
I ask about the saint Joseph's altar. Neal says that the celebration at Mary 
Star is in his opinion one of the best in California. The central part of the 
celebration in his opinion is that they collect food for the poor. The 
tradition goes back to an event that happened in Sicily many years ago when 
the fishermen's community did not have enough food to eat and suddenly they 
received this manifold of fish so they pray to saint Joseph. 
We go back to the video. The ICF people do the cooking for the dinner. Neal 
mentions that in march they have another celebration for Saint John Joseph 
when they have a all fish dinner attended by 500 people. The saint died in 
march and was born in august, so they have two celebrations. 
The video shows people having free coffee and rolls after Mass. 
Neal took shots of different friends: one is called "Sauriello," a kind of 
Spanish mackerel, because he is short. He took a shot of the pastries and 
goodies on the tables, not Ischian pastries but nice anyway, he says. 
The video moves to the afternoon with shots of the auditorium set up for 400 
people. The statue is on a stage in the middle of the auditorium. People are 
barbecueing chicken and stakes. 
Then shots of the dinner-dance. Tony Di Bruno's band is playing "good 
Neapolitan songs," as well as American songs. While we listen to one song I 
ask Anna about her cooking: for Christmas Eve she cooks the traditional fish 
dinner at their house. 
The video shows the table where the people who prepared the dinner sit. They 
all wear aprons with the colors of the Italian flag. 
People dance "the chicken dance," a dance popular in Italy ten/fifteen years 
ago. It's a fun dance in which people move their feet and hands like chickens. 
vT 
T IAW-PT-A016=Ernesto Fortino (Ernie for his friends) came from Cosenza, 
Calabria on December 1959 and "made California his home." He was born in 1936. 
He tells us the story of his grandfather who went to Argentina to work for 
several years and then around 1890 went to work in the coal mines in 
Pittsburgh, Kansas. Ernesto's father, Mike, was born in Kansas in 1905 and 
when he was 6 years old the family moved back to Italy where they bought a 
ranch and made wine. Mike lost his American citizenship when he went to the 
military service in Italy. His brother Carmine Fortino, also born in the 
States, left Italy to go back to Kansas around 1933 (the family had money only 
to send one of the sons back to America.) Then he left Kansas and decided to 
go west and ended up in Gilroy where he called for the rest of his family back 
in Kansas (cousins and friends). 
After the war, Carmine filed the papers to have his two brothers, Mike and 
Francesco come to Gilroy. Because of some friction in the family only 
Francesco was able to come and Ernesto's father stayed in Calabria until 1959 
when finally he obtained his American citizenship and came with his whole 
family. 
Ernesto was in France for three years (20-23 years old) before coming to the 
States. "In Italy we were always working, and working, and we never got 
anywhere...I stumped grapes for years with my feet, I cultivated the 
vineyards, pruned the vineyards and grafting and planting, it really became, 
as a child, hard work and I wanted to get away from grapes. In France there 
was a little more opportunity." He worked in a saw mill and in the woods, 
cutting trees. Then he joined his parents, and his brother and sister in 
Gilroy. 
Gilroy was a small town (8000 people). A lot of agriculture work was available 
for them and a lot of Italian people from their town, Donnici (province of 
Cosenza) were involved in wine making. "And this is what we were good at... 
what we had done for years back in Italy and people were happy to have us with 
the knowledge and hard work. We could not speak English but we could work." 
In the winter time they worked in the fields and in the summer time in the 
canneries (Felice and Perelli canning company). When he first came he was 
making 95 cents an hour and worked 10/12 hours a day. The family stayed with 
an aunt for a few months then rented a house from her. 
Ernesto calls himself "aggressive" and because of that he says he was able to 
buy a house which he paid 15,000 dollars and worked three jobs to pay it. 
Ernesto did not go to school to learn English. He learned from friends, 
talking with people. 
Everybody worked in the family "because when you come from a 'stranger' 
(foreign) cowntry, nobody comes and gives you ... now we do a lot more for our 
friends and ancestors than they did for us. At the time nobody was in a 
financial position to help us." 
As time went buy Ernesto got better jobs and made more money. 
He met his wife and got married in Santa Cruz. He worked at the San Lorenzo 
lumber yard. Then he had the opportunity to work in a liquor store-wine 
tasting room in Monterey and eventually to become a partner in the business. 
His wife worked there too and learned about wine tasting and wine making and 
how to sell wine. The 
partnership did not materialize, and at the same time 
(1970) the winery that Ernesto now owns was for sale. He says that it had been 
for sale for ten years and it was a real dump. There was no equipment, no 
business anymore. The people who owned it were Italians from Milan (Angelo and 
Loui Cassa). In the sixties they had problems, then one brother passed away. 
They could not speak English. When Ernesto came here to meet the owner the old 
man cried. He told him that he would have liked to buy it but that he did not 
have money. They came to an agreement and Ernesto and his brother Mario (owner 
of the Hecker Pass winery next door) bought the winery. One year later the 
brothers split. 
Ernesto and his wife started with the help of Ernesto's parents. 
"We really did it by ourselves." He quit his job in Monterey and worked in the 
vineyards without any help. They did the picking, crushing, everything by 
themselves and saved money to buy equipment. "We started very small and very 
bottom." 
"Only in America I was able to do what I did, to make this big step in 
business." 
He talks about the many Italians who made it in America. He comments about 
mafia:"But even mafia was something good." He heard stories about Italians 
back in Kansas who were really mistreated. He admires his ancestors who came 
before him and made Italians to be respected. "Italians brought a culture 
here. They made America, they helped to make America. Italians have culture in 
many ways, not only farming but also bricklaying, masonry, builders, 
accounting... of course they used to make a lot of bootlegging too." 
Ernesto comments on the Italian-American Heritage meeting he attended a week 
ago in San Jose where they served his wine (9 cases of it) and where he met 
all the "prominenti." John De Vincenzi, professor at San Jose University; 
Victor Vanni, doctor at the University of Santa Clara, and others were there 
to honor the founder of the club. Judge Pannelli from San Francisco was there. 
"It was amazing for me to be among these people to celebrate the Italian-
American heritage. Many of them are in their seventies and I am really happy 
that all those people made it happen for us... and I really feel I am Italian-
American heritage and I want to be Italian-American not just Italian." 
side 2 
We ask Ernesto about the winery. He tells us how he started in 1971, insisting 
on his coming from a three generation wine making family. "We worked hard but 
we were able to accomplish the impossible." From a three thousand square feet 
building that they started with they have now twenty seven thousand square 
feet. 230 thousand gallons capacity winery. Very large tasting room. Large oak 
casks, stained steel; a fermentation room, a storage room and an aging room. 
Facilities for banquets; a deli and a boutique shop. People really like their 
wine because is natural "we do all naturally from the grapes to the bottle of 
wine." 
He says this is one of the largest wineries and the whole family works in it. 
His son Gino (23) and his daughter Terry (21) and her husband (24), and his 
wife Mary, all work together. 
"Through the winery I was able to meet people from all over the world... it's 
amazing how different cultures... everybody has the same goal, the same 
tradition, the same thinking to survive, to make good... in many ways I'm proud 
of myself, to be an Italian-American and to come to this country and create 
such a business that I'm able to give jobs, pay insurance and payrolls, in 
return I create a lot of revenues for other people... I'm really proud of being 
here in America." 
He teaches his son wine making and grape growing. "Wine making is not really a 
laboratory work ...wine making is an art, it's a knowledge by itself. Our 
grape is a natural fruit, we don't have to add chemicals to make wine. Back in 
Italy we never had any tests or anything, you taste by mouth, we see it 
whether the grape was sweeter, of course we were never sure ... but it was 
enough to make good wine back there." 
He started with red wine, as they did in Italy, but now they make 22 wines, a 
good amount of which is white, the most of which is red. His clientele knows 
?T-Ao j 
l
•, 
the Fortino wine as red wine. 
Division of work and responsibilities in the winery : until recently Ernesto 
and his wife "were doing all the work." In the last couple of years the kids 
started to work with them: the son has responsibility for production and wine 
making; the son-in-law is more responsible,for the sales and the tasting room; 
the daughter works in the boutique and the deli store while Ernesto and his 
wife supervise the whole thing. "But still we are part of the workers not only 
supervisors... this is when many companies fail, they start a business and 
then they put a bookkeeper, an 
assistant manager and they watch it grow, and no business will grow unless the 
person behind the business makes it grow. And this is what I want to do, and I 
want to make sure that my son and my son-in-law follow the same footsteps..." 
The three men do the pruning themselves with a Mexican worker . A few years ago 
he bought a pruning machine from Italy which works with air. "We do the 
pruning because we know how to prune. It's difficult to find people who know 
how to prune ... we shape the vines the way it is supposed to be." They hire 
people for picking the grapes, for work in the fields, for short time jobs 
that need to be done. 
Russell asks him to go through the process of what needs to be done in the 
vineyards month by month. 
September /October is the "vendemmia" or harvest time. In Gilroy the beautiful 
weather (warm days and cool nights that the grapes need ) allow them "to play 
games ourselves ", that is to decide when they want to pick. This year is a 
little early , because spring was warm. He hopes to finish crushing this year 
by the end of september. 
Then for a couple of months (october /november) they work the wine: 
clarification , and putting it away for aging. 
By december they have to bottle some wines. 
In january they start pruning grapes. The frost comes, the leaves drop and 
it's time to prune. Pruning goes on until february . The Fortino have 65 acres 
and it takes four men about four weeks to finish pruning with the machine. 
They switched to the machine only four years ago , in 1985. 
From february to april there is not much to do in the vineyard. 
In april they start to plough (french plough and disking). 
In may /june there is a lot of wild growth on the vines that they have to clean 
up. For this job they hire extra people to take all the extra growth of the 
vines, to get the vines to grow more vigorous. 
I ask if they spray "verderame" (verdigris ) on the vines. He says they used it 
in Italy because of the fog , but here they only spray dusting sulphur. They 
spray it two or three times per year, in may and june, and sometimes later 
depending on the weather. 
From june to september , they do not do anything to the vineyards . Roughly, it 
takes about three months of work to take care of the vineyard. In the meantime 
they do the work in the winery. 
He describes how the french plough works. 
He tells us which kind of grapes grow best here. The first Italians used to 
have Zinfandel , Carignane , Alicante , Bouchet, Mission. Then when the wine 
industry became more sophisticated they started with Cabernet Sauvignon, Pinot 
Noir, Chardonnay , Sauvignon Blanc. He produces 22 wines including Charbono and 
Burgundy. 
He explains how to test the sugar content of the grapes. 
Russell asks which part of the wine making process he considers "art." "The 
whole process is an art. You have to know when you pick your grapes , you have 
to know how to cultivate your grapes ... it's an art in every way ... the art of 
wine making is almost from beginning to end ... and after the wine is made you 
got to know how to keep the wine and how you prevent from spoilage. It's very 
simple: the air is the enemy of the wine and the only way to keep the air out 
is to fill the tank up to the rim, to the top ... The art comes with care..."

T IAW-PT-A017=Special celebration for the "vendemmia" or grape harvest: in 
Gilroy eight wineries get together and have festivals twice a year. Also the 
Fortino winery has dinners, wine tasting, employees picnics throughout the 
year. 
"Through the tasting room ... we are able to educate the American people, they 
know nothing about wine ... most wines they consider like marijuana or drug 
thing... and wine is not really considered a beverage. Wine has iron, has 
minerals, it's good with food. It's food in itself. It's not a beverage to get 
drunk, to get high. Really I'm very disappointed with laws and rules and so 
many people who throw blocks in the winery and warnings..." 
Religious observances that have to do with wine making: Ernesto does not 
remember any particular things. "Of course we were all catholics in Italy...I 
really do not relate any religion to wine making. Of course in Italy everybody 
drinks wine, kids, grown ups, ladies, men, we all drink wine... Wine was more 
like food. A glass of wine was more a relaxing thing. If you follow the 
tradition of wine consumption, in Italy they have the least amount of crime 
caused by drunk driving ... they don't think nothing of it. Kids drink wine, 
they grow up they know what wine tastes like, they don't go out and get 
drunk..." 
I ask if they follow the moon for certain works in the vineyards, and if they 
follow the tradition of changing the wine for San Martino (october 12). 
Ernesto says that they do not follow the moon for work related to wine making 
but he knows what I mean because his mother follows the cycle of the moon when 
she plants tomatoes and vegetables. He remembers an old saying from Calabria: 
"San Martino, tutto it mosto e' vino," (For Saint Martin, all the must becomes 
wine). They do not follow the same tradition because "here we crush our 
grapes, and it takes so many days to ferment, it takes so many days to 
clarify, and then we put it in the wood for aging." 
We ask about celebration and festival that he remembers from Italy. He 
remembers the close family collaborating in the picking of the grapes: "we 
used to go around and help each others and every end of the day, most of us, I 
used to play the accordion myself, we had a little dance, we would get 
together and have a spaghetti feast and accordion playing and dancing. At the 
end of the crushing there was more'festivity back in Italy. Here we are more 
commercial. We do festivity but we cannot do it daily." 
He talks more about the work in Italy, from sun-up to sun-down: they 
cultivated not only grapes but fava beans and tomatoes and they used to make 
bricks by hand. "It was very hard work. We used to do farming early in the 
morning, and make bricks during the day when it was warmer ... and then in the 
evenings we used to go and work in the ranch again ... we had all kinds of 
fruits, figs, we used to dry our figs, we used to make olive oil; we had goats 
and cows, we had to milk them and make cheese; we had the hogs that we used to 
'grow' for the winter time, sausages, ham, and coppa. It was a self sustained 
farm." The only things he remembers they had to buy were: tobacco for his dad, 
salt, and sometimes clothing, and shoes. The ranch in Italy still belongs to 
the family but nobody cultivates it anymore. 
Here the Fortinos cultivate olive trees, and a vegetable garden, not as big as 
they would like it to be because they spend all their time at the winery. They 
grow tomatoes, beans, cucumbers, zucchini, "finocchio." 
He invites us to the dinner party next saturday so that we can ask questions 
to his customers and see for ourselves "how people accept the facts of wine."

140j7, 
There are going to be many Italian-Americans, and Americans who married 
Italians. 
Ernesto's daughter married an American of German descent. He says:" I never 
had prejudice toward nationality, never. I always felt that the whole world is 
one town (Italian saying: "Tutto it mondo e' paese) and I trust everybody, I 
love everybody, until they prove different..." 
The food for the dinner party is going to be cooked by family members (pasta 
con pesto, barbecued Santa Maria steaks, cold cuts from the deli, focaccia 
made by a friend who has the right oven.) 
I refer to the special food that we cook in my region for the vendemmia. 
Ernesto says there is no special food for the vendemmia. Special food is 
cooked for Christmas Eve: baccala, anchovies with pasta, a fish dinner. For 
Easter they cook special bread called "cozzupa" in the Calabrese dialect, a 
round bread with an egg in the middle. 
Russell asks about the work in the canneries when he first came. Most of the 
workers were Italians, he says 80% Italians and the rest Mexicans. Today, 
Italians of his generation are involved in other kind of business, from 
farming to construction. 
Russell asks about the connection between growers/ wine makers in Gilroy and 
the fishermen on the other side of the pass. Ernesto's father-in-law was a 
fisherman: he used to get the fish from his in-laws and they would get the 
wine from him. 
"I met many Italians here and everybody is proud to be Italian or related to 
Italians or to be associated with Italians. The Board of supervisors here, the 
Santa Clara supervisor is Rod Deridon. When his father came from Italy he was 
'Deridona', then they change it ... He says that there is only two kind of 
people in America: those who are italian and those who wish they were 
Italian!" 
Ernesto has a wine cellar at home where he ages wine since 1971. 
"We have been aging wine not only to have a wine cellar but to learn the 
experience of see how wine aged well from '71 to now. And those wines.. it 
becomes part of the art I was saying before: you can look back and see the 
wine that you made in '71, how it aged today ... you want to have the experience 
yourself to tell your customers what to do." 
Side 2 
Tour of the winery. 
Ernesto shows us and describes the machines in every room. We start with the 
crushing room: crushing machinery, the dumper. The building was built "inch by 
inch" by Ernesto. Russell asks him how he learned how to do all this: masonry, 
carpentry, pouring concrete. "It's common sense. I think that if a lot of 
people used common sense in this world, it would come a lot easier! I was born 
and raised in a farming family ... but when I came to America I saw so many 
different jobs to be done such as masonry, lay concrete, or carpentry that I'm 
not really professional in anyone but..they call it 'Jack of all trades.' I 
needed to learn how to do it to accomplish what I did. I could not pay people 
to do the job, so I had to learn myself to save the money. In exchange or 
return I used to buy material: lumber, concrete, metals, machinery, 
pumps ... the office machinery, computers, many things that you need in the 
P7=,40/7,3 
business and so instead of paying contractors ... I used the money elsewhere...I 
use a lot of common sense and today I'm really happy to say that I show my 
family, my son, my son-in-law what to do, how to do it and they can use the 
same things as well. My son, by seeing me lay concrete and make the whole 
winery happen, it gave him an opportunity to learn. He went to school and 
learned mechanic and a little electrical sq my son is as good as anybody can 
be in any trade." His son can fix things, and this is how a lot of money is 
saved and can be used to expand the business. 
Both Ernesto and his son are in charge of the crushing room. 
He continues to explain the process from crushing the grapes to separating the 
juice from the stems. The grapes come into the primary fermentation vats. The 
juice and the skins go into the redwood tanks and stay there for four /six 
days. Then they press the juice out of the skins and this completes the 
fermentation stage. From here the wine is taken to the storage room, they let 
it clarify and then is put in oak tanks for aging. Their wine is aged from 2 
to 7 years in oak. 
He describes a special tank that his son uses to make Charbono wine for the 
first time. He is experimenting with it 
He tells us the time when he built the several rooms and concludes saying "Now 
I want to see when my son is going to build onel..(talking to the son) If you 
can do as well as I did, you are going to have the world in your hands!" 
Russell asks what is the most gratifying moment for him in all this. "Meet 
friends, family, be able to look back and say: Look, I did this, I 
accomplished this." 
We enter the storage room: in the stainless steel tanks the wine is left to 
clarify and from there is pumped into the oak tanks where it ages. There are 
oak tanks from 50 gallon to 6 thousand gallon capacity. 
I ask Ernesto about a little wood hammer on one of the tanks. It is used for 
bungs in a tank. A friend of his made a big joke out of a bung hole and now 
Ernesto uses this joke everyday. "A bung hole it's a hole on top of a tank 
where the cork or the bung fits in the hole. The hole is between a inch and a 
half and three inches in diameter and the cork of wood has to be the size of 
the hole." Some people use the word "bung hole" instead of just saying hole (I 
still don't understand the joke) 
Ernesto is called by his daughter. ` I ask his son Gino what he likes about this 
job. He likes the variety of it: "You are not doing the same things all the 
time, you do a lot of different things." He is in charge of the wine making. 
"Hopefully one day my dad will retire and I'll take over." He has been working 
full time in the winery for the past two years. We walk with him outside where 
he shows us the tractor they use to till the soil in the vineyard, and old and 
new knives they use to pick the grapes. We visit the bottling room. The 
machines are pretty old and break easily, Gino says. Then we enter another, 
storage room filled with white material used for insolation. "The white wines, 
you have to cold stabilize them. So you run them through a refrigerator that 
chills the wine and then you filter it all." Gino shows me a pad filter; the 
wine is filtered through pads, like coffee filter pads but thicker. This 
building is the oldest building on the property; it was there when Ernesto 
bought the winery in 1970. 
Gino shows me the machine, from Italy, that they use to prune the vines. It is 
air operated; it has four lines and four people can work at the same time. 
I ask him what is new about the Charbono grapes that he is experimenting with. 
"There are not a lot of grapes in California, there are about four or five 
wineries now that produce Charbono ... About six years ago we planted some of 
our own Charbono grapes, not very many, only about an acre, three or four 
hundreds vines. This year we had a pretty good crop, the birds did not it, so 
I decided to make a little bash of it. 
I go to talk to Terry in her "New European boutique," specializing in 
weddings, anniversaries, baby favors. This, was Terry and her mother's idea. 
"During the process of my big, huge Italian wedding we realized the price of 
favors (bomboniere), we tried to get a little creative with different nettings 
and tried to get some Italian ideas in here. Even the American people 
appreciate all of these." 
In the last month they provided the favors for three weddings. They sell 
"capodimonte" and silver almonds which you find only in Italy. 
We talk about her wedding: she had an Italian designed white dress. "We had a 
really large Italian catholic wedding," with 350 people. The bomboniera she 
chose is a nice parfume bottle. They had Italian music, "it was like a fiesta 
with a lot of Italian people. My maid of honor, she gave her toast in Italian 
(even if she is Danish and learned Italian in school) ... We gave speeches to 
our parents and we gave them presents, at normal weddings they would not do 
that. There were gifts for everyone ... It was really nice, really elaborate." 
(see my fieldnotes for the rest of our talk.)

T IAW-PT-A018--Teresa Filice tells us the story of her family. All the Filices 
came to America because her father's nephews, whose last name was Biseglia, 
came here as young boys around the end of the century 
(1880/1890). They were 
the 
children of the oldest sister of Teresa's father. They started to work on 
the railroad back east, then they slowly moved to San Francisco, then to 
Morgan Hill. "They found that the climate and the surrounding area were 
similar to where we came from. Where we came from was all canyons and 
hills ... At that time they found that the cannery business was something new, 
something that was developing." They were three or four brothers and they 
started a cannery in Paradise Valley (where the dam is now). According to 
Teresa the Biseglia boys moved the cannery from that location to Morgan Hill, 
near the railroad, and then started a bigger cannery in Gilroy. Originally 
they processed only tomatoes; later they started to process fruit too. Then 
they wanted to go bigger and moved to San Jose where they build a large 
cannery. (Teresa does not remember precise dates and she refers us to the 
grand-niece of the Biseglias who lives in San Jose for the full story of that 
family) 
Teresa's family came in 1906. Her father and his brother and their families 
came together by boat and it took them about a month to get to Gilroy. Teresa 
remembers that they took the train from San Francisco and got off almost in 
front of the cannery owned by the Biseglia Brothers in Gilroy. In Calabria 
they worked in the fields for the landlord. In Gilroy the whole family started 
to work at the Biseglia cannery. 
Teresa's father bought 24 acres of land in Morgan Hill and planted a vineyard. 
Teresa does not know exactly how her father got the money to buy the land. She 
supposes that the lady who sold him the land waited to be paid until her 
father started to make money. In 1919 the family moved to Gilroy where they 
bought land and continued to make wine. When prohibition laws started he went 
into ranching. "In those days if you paid 6 or 7 hundred dollars an acre you 
got choice land. And he thought that choice land was all the land which 
bordered a creek. He did not speak English, he did not go to school in Italy, 
so how he knew these things I don't know..." 
Mimi (Teresa's niece) talks about Teresa's father (her grandfather): "He was 
like a computer... they did not keep any of the men's hours ...at the end of 
the week my uncle would have to make out the payrolls, they'd ask my 
grandfather and he would figure ... well, Jo gets so many hours, at 35 cents an 
hour and he'd come up with an answer ... Plus, when people had to divide 
property, when they had trouble in the family, my grandfather was called on, 
he was like an attorney..." 
Jo (Giuseppe) Filice is the name of Teresa's father. He had 8 children, 6 were 
born in Italy, 2 were born here. I ask Teresa about her brothers and sisters' 
work. "In those days we did not think or we did not have the money to go to 
higher education, we did not believe in it, perhaps was it too. There was 4 
custom then, that the boys stayed and helped the father. Not today, you know, 
the boys go to college, and the father has to sell the land because he is 
getting old and can't do it. In those days, it was a custom of the old 
country: the boys stayed with their father." 
Mimi says:"In those days they raised their pigs, and killed the pigs and make 
their prosciutto, their coppa, and their salami, their lard and raised a 
garden ... they always had chickens, goats for your milk." 
Teresa worked in the farm: she picked prunes, picked grapes, picked peaches 
and sold them on the fruit stand on the highway. 
Teresa's mother died quite young. Teresa never married. She lived with her 
father until he died at the age of 82. Mimi tells us that Teresa had a beauty 
?T ,-1ct?, a 
shop in which she worked until four years ago. I ask Teresa how she decided to 
become a beautician: 
"When we paid off our ranch, we used to sell our peaches on the highway, then 
the time came when the men had to go to the prunes, they had to go and work in 
the dehydrator, that left some peaches on the trees and we went and gathered 
them and sold them on the highway and I made enough money that I wanted to 
take up beauty work. That was something new in those days too, back in 1938." 
Teresa goes back to talk about the hard life in Italy. "The living, it was 
very hard to live with the landlords. They made it so hard ... people were kept 
so behind by the landlord that living becomes a hardship ... the first fruit 
that came, it had to go to the landlord; you had to be careful how you spoke 
to them, by name, they had certain names. When these young boys came here and 
noticed how free it was, that you could move and do what you wanted, they 
couldn't help but write and say how much nicer it was here ... That all happened 
around the time of Columbus, you know, for a long time, it's like the time of 
Jesus: the years after that it's a very strong thing that happened. The same 
thing with Columbus: for many years after that it became very strong and very 
interesting: America..." 
I ask Teresa to tell us about her life when she was growing up in the farm, 
if they had contact with other Italian families. 
"..We had our own little circle of people who came from the same town, because 
there were many of us from Calabria, from the little villages were we 
lived ... we had our own get togethers. At weddings, it was a custom then, you 
invited your relatives... but we stayed among ourselves for many years ... now 
it's all together 
different. Now young people they don't know their relatives..." 
Mimi adds: "In those days you married an Italian, now everybody marries on the 
outside." She married an Italian, whose father was from Venice and whose 
mother was from Toscany. 
They talk more about the family. Mimi's mother (Teresa's oldest sister) helped 
her father with the business and always translated for him, who never learned 
English. Mimi says: "My mother was the oldest, never went to school, did not 
know how to read or write, my mother drove without a driver's licence until 
she died... she knew her figures, and where she could get the best deal.." 
Side 2 
Wedding customs: Teresa says that they carried the customs from Italy. When a 
girl married, the father would pay for her wedding. 
I ask if girls had the trousseau. Teresa knows that in the old country: "it 
was a big thing. For a girl to marry she had to bring so much and if she did 
not have so much she would not get married." Here she says that the trousseau 
meant only your personal things, and not the sheets. Mimi corrects her saying 
that girls had sheets when they got married. Teresa agrees but says that you 
were not required anymore to have a certain number of items in order to get 
married like they did in Calabria. 
Mimi tells us that wedding in the family were held in the fruit house, after 
they were married in the church. "Their custom was, it was called 
"rancitello," it was made from lamb parts, the liver, the heart, the lung and 
then they would have like a stew, that was made into a stew, because usually 
they used to kill lamb to do that... and then they had a large brick oven and 
they used to make all their bread and pastries." Mimi still makes that lamb 
stew once on a while; it's a lot of work she says, but it's delicious. 
P 
I — • 
"Weddings were fun in those days . Everything was cooked at home." 
Mimi explains that the fruit house was the place where the prunes were kept 
after they were dried until they were sold in october/november. Once on a 
while they would check the prunes, and eliminate those which were not dry 
enough and would get worms, or mold. If the prunes were too dry the farmers 
would sprinkle a little water on them to get more weight. 
I ask Mimi about her family. Her father , Michele, came from Bari (Puglia). He 
was in ranching too: he had prunes , pears, and made wine and sold it . He came 
to America in 1905 /6. His brothers and him had gone to Naples to look for a 
job but he did not get one. " Pretty soon my father's brother thought.."Where 
is Michele .. he had jumped on a ship and came to New York and he worked his way 
to Portland , working on railroads, then came down to this area. He said 'it 
was rough .' He came here wearing his Italian hat, the Italian clothes and 
people would throw snow balls at them and call them waps, dagos , and all that. 
It was hard when Italians first came to America." 
Mimi says that it was not 
as hard for them. They worked a lot, but it was not hard as for her father. 
There were no festivals after the grapes or prunes harvest. "We were glad when 
it was over!" 
Mimi remembers the time when they had to dry the prunes in the trays in the 
sun: "If it would rain at night, we all had to get out of bed and stack the 
trays and then we would put the trays like this so the water would run off of 
them. Then the next day to clear up ... we would get all the trays and put them 
out in the field again to dry. Then after that we build a large dehydrator, 
you know, gas." 
There were dances in Gilroy, Mimi remembers there was a park where people 
would go to. In the thirties there was a rodeo, "and that was quite an affair, 
they had a dance at the armory. And on saturday nights there was a lot of 
celebrating downtown... At that time there were a lot of Italians here and 
there were not the Mexicans , we have a lot of Mexicans now, so when you'd go 
to these dances , Mexicans would not dare to go because there were not many 
around Gilroy... so it was alright to go to the dances because there was 
everybody you knew at that time." 
There was no Italian neighborhood in Gilroy, "Italians were just all over 
Gilroy; at the cannery at that time there were all Italians, and it was fun 
working because you knew everybody there." 
Mimi tells us more about the work at the cannery: "it was 'piece work': more 
work you did, you got paid for. Now it's all hourly work." She explains the 
work done by hand with tomatoes and fruits . Women were in charge of the 
peeling and canning. During the war women did the men's work (dumping the 
fruit) and got men's wages for that work. They worked "until the fruit was all 
done: if it took until midnight, you worked until midnight." Mimi started to 
work there when she was twelve, lying about her age. They would work sometimes 
ten/twelve hours per day. 
In Gilroy they started canning spinach in the spring, the apricots in July, 
then peaches and pears, then the fruit cocktail, with grapes and pineapples. 
Mimi talks about her mother's 
peppers, zucchini, eggplants, 
vegetable and then either fix 
batter and dip the vegetables 
cooking. She would sun dry tomatoes, bell 
and in the winter time she would soak the 
them with tomatoes or fry them . She would make a 
in that and fried them. She would store the 
dried vegetables in paper bags and tie a string on top and hang them in the 
basement. Mimi does the same today with zucchini and tomatoes. Then she 
remembers they would kill the pig and cook the pig skin and put that under 
lard. They would use it to cook fava beans or cabbage. Her mother would make 
"conserva" (tomato sauce):"she would cook the tomatoes and keep stirring it 
two or three times a day with a cheese cloth over it.
,, Teresa adds:"We did not 
go to the store in the summer, we did not go in the winter, because what we 
raised in the summer we would prepare it for the winter... everything was in 
brine: green tomatoes in brine, eggplants in brine, peppers in brine, olives, 
anchovies. That was food for the winter. Then we had our chickens, we did not 
have to eat all that salty staff all the time ... we had eggs, and we had a cow, 
we had milk everyday, so it was a much healthier eating than it is today..." 
Mimi talks about special food for special occasions: the day before Lent, (I 
believe is Ash Wednesday) they would make home made pasta and home made sauce 
with pork and a fried pastry with "ceci," garbanzo beans. On Christmas eve 
they had broccoli, pasta with anchovies and "baccala" (dried salted cod) 
either dipped in batter and fried or in the oven with tomatoes, potatoes, and 
carrots. "That was Christmas Eve, every Christmas Eve we had the same dinner. 
Mama would distribute it to all the neighbors that were either widowers or 
were not married. She would bring over a dish of that food on Christmas Eve." 
For the Epiphany (January 6th) the old timers would go from house to house and 
sing and everybody would come out offering the pastry that they had made. 
Teresa remembers that her father's nephews played the guitar and the mandolin 
during these occasions.

T IAW-PT-A019=Ed Pedrizzetti was born on october 23, 1927. His wife, Phyllis, 
on october 27, 1928. 
Ed was born at home in San Martin. His father, John, worked for the cannery. 
Then they moved up the road, they bought a ranch with grapes and prunes. His 
father worked for San Martin winery for 9 years and at the same time he worked 
at night for the distillery of the San Martin winery (which they do not have 
anymore). He had his own grapes and they did a lot of farming in the valley 
between prunes and grapes and tomatoes and walnuts. The winery that the 
Pedrizzetti own today was bought by John in 1945. He used to buy and sell 
ranches: he would farm them for a while and then sell them. He bought this 
place and kept it and the family has had it since then. The family started a 
tasting room on the old highway 101 in 1968. 
Ed's parents are both northerners, from Piemonte and Lombardia. His father 
came to America when he was 9 years old. His mother was born in Albany, 
California. 
Phyllis tells us that he came over just before the earthquake in 1906. "They 
were in Oakland when the earthquake hit and they went over to San Francisco 
and they were just starving. So they broke into a store and swept a great big 
salami. Then they got real thirsty and the only way you could get any water 
was that you had to go and work with the crews for the clean up and they were 
afraid they would be conscripted into the army, because there were soldiers 
doing the clean up... somehow they got their way back to Oakland so that they 
would not get conscripted back into that work force. Never steal a salami, in 
other wordsl" (moron story). 
Then they went down to San Juan to the cement plan where the family stayed for 
a number of years. "There is where your uncle and aunt were born. His dad was 
the only single birth, your grandmother had two sets of twins." 
Russell asks what Ed knows about his grandfather's work back in Italy and why 
he decided to come to America. Ed does not remember much. Phyllis tells us 
that they were 4 brothers and 1 sister and that they all came to the States. 
One of the brothers went into the iron mines in Minnesota, the other three 
brothers and the sister came to California. They are sure that the family back 
in Italy was involved in wine making, even if Phyllis says that the coat of 
arms indicates that they were stone workers. 
Four generations of Pedrizzetti are in Gilroy (Ed's father, who is 90 years 
old, Ed, his son, and his grandchild). Ed was the only child. His mother, 
Phyllis says, worked very hard, "like a man" in the fields. And Phyllis 
herself worked hard: "I can remember working in the winery when the kids, our 
babies were small, before we had a forklift. A truck would come in loaded with 
cases of gallons, glass first we used, and Ed would go up on the truck and he 
would throw the case down to his dad and then his dad would throw the case to 
me and I would throw it to his mother and she would stack them. That's how,we 
unloaded the cases and we did 12 hundred cases at a time. The kids used to 
call me 'Popeye' because from lifting the gallon jugs, we would bottle, we 
could do a thousand gallons a day, just the two of us... from lifting the 
gallon jugs, because they weight 11 and a quarter pounds each, see, from 
lifting with one hand I had learned suddenly to be ambidexter." 
Ed continues: "We did a lot of gallons back in the forties, and fifties and 
sixties also and we did a lot of bulk wine also with other wineries. And I 
used to deliver to all the bay area, about once or twice a week in a big 
truck, I used to ... to deliver to families and stores, not too many. We kept 
that up until 1972 and then expenses got to high to be doing things like that, 
prices got up. So we quit that." 
While Ed is busy outside I ask Phyllis what Ed's mother duties were in the 
winery. "She had three jobs: she worked in the fields right alongside him, 
doing work just exactly like a man, she was also a mother and she was also a 
wife and housekeeper. She did everything that most women do plus working out 
eight/ten/twelve hours in the fields. She worked in the dehydrator, they 
dipped prunes, it's a tough life. She would drive the truck while John would 
load the boxes... she run a fruit stand for extra income; she made fancy 
candies: she would dry the fruit and then she would dip them in chocolate or 
else she would take the big prunes and steam them after they are dried, she 
would steam them, take the pit out, stuff them with walnuts and then dip them. 
All of this for extra income..." She stopped working in the fields when they 
moved into the new house they built in 1951, but continued to help in the 
winery. She was 41 years old. 
Phyllis tells us what a prune dipper is: "You have to dip the fresh 
prunes ... you dip them in a lay(?) bath, it's boiling hot water... and then you 
run them through the dehydrator and it makes them shrivel and dry, so the 
sugar stays in them. You don't dry them in the fields like our raisins..." 
Phyllis comments on her husband: "He is just Italian enough that he assigns 
roles and my role, besides taking care of the house, and him, and of course 
always the kids, now my job is to take care of the tasting room. I say 'where 
is it written in stone that I have to take care of the tasting room?' Because 
I usually work right there on the bottling line with him... We do everything 
together." 
Phyllis says that she did not want to marry a man who worked in a office: "I 
knew if I married a man, I had to be a part of his life. I could never have 
married a doctor. What do you see a doctor? Two hours a day ... We have been 
together for forty years, same house... same spouse, same job..." 
The Pedrizzetti have two daughters and 
business. One daughter is married to a 
secretary; the other daughter lives in 
Ed's plan when he decides to retire is 
be bothered by the fact that nobody is 
"I'm not an ego trip like a lot of the 
Russell asks "Do you have a love for it 
living?" Ed says "It's a way to make a living, it's a hard job , you have some 
hard people to deal with. It's not like it was back in the fifties, forties 
and fifties, it's all together a different game. It was a pleasure to be in 
the wine business in those years but now, now it's not, it's just a job... It 
was fun, you knew everybody, but now..." 
Phyllis adds: "the prohibitionists are just putting such pressure on the 
wineries with all these warning labels that we have to put on, and it has 
actually decreased sales. People who don't know any better look at the label 
and see that it says 'contains sulfites' and think that we are putting 
something bad in the wine and it's nothing more than what has been put in for 
the last two thousands years! But we all see a decrease in business because of 
these government restrictions... We are not allowed to put on the label that 
wine is good for you. Wine in moderation, although it has been scientifically 
proven that wine in moderation is good for you, we are not allowed to put it 
on the label. So why are they allowed to make us put a statement on there that 
is harmful to your health... A glass of wine, has got to be beneficial! All 
you have to do is look at all of your Mediterranean countries who daily drink 
one son. They are not involved in the 
cement contractor and works as a 
Maui; the son works as a counselor. 
to sell the winery. He does not seem to 
going to continue the family business. 
wine people are, not at all." 
or it has been a way to make a 
fT- Aol1,3 
wine...I have three very bright, beautiful children, and three gorgeous 
grandchildren: I drank wine all the time when I was pregnant! It was always 
with my evening meal and was part of our food. They have really taken all the 
pleasure out of it." They think upon retirement to live six months in Montana, 
where things are as they used to be in the Santa Clara valley, and six months 
in a warmer place. 
Phyllis adds: " I hear people say 
'oh, how could you retire? How could you 
leave the wine business?' How could you leave any job! You Know, let's be 
sensible. They talk about the romance of wine making... The only romance there 
is in wine is sitting in front of the fireplace with somebody you love and 
each have a glass of wine! That's romance! (everybody laughs) Making wine is 
not romantic; it's exciting, exhilarating, frustrating." 
I ask about the old times, if they have good memories of the harvest time. 
Phyllis remembers that they would have groups of Italians and parties, 
everybody laughing and singing: "It was a whole different life style when I 
was growing up... If we could have kept the old Italian style, where everybody 
got together and would help ... that's how John found out about this place ... He 
would come and help mister Colombano in his harvest and the pruning and so on 
and so forth ... the old original winery here was built in 1919 ... there was a 
loft upstairs and they would have parties and they would put mattresses at the 
bottom of the stairs (laughing) ..in case anybody fall down the stairs from 
drinking too much!" 
I ask if they remember names of the friends who used to help in the harvest. 
Phyllis mentions some names and says that they had a club named 'handle bar 
club.' There were two or three french men and the rest were Italians. She does 
not know the reason for that name, they would get together once a month and 
they would sing. She starts with the first word of a song "Marietta 
dammela..." I don't know what the words mean! all italian songs and Pep would 
play the accordion, they were wonderful... When they died the all life style 
died out with them." 
Ed remembers when he used-to deliver gallon jugs to the 'old Italian 
families': "Now you don't find those type of people that buy that type of 
wine, it's all bottles and things like that, that generation is gone." Phyllis 
says:" Now it has to be Cabernet or Pinot Noir. Then they bought red wine or 
white wine ... and the women did not` drink that much, they would probably have a 
glass with their evening meal, generally they were so busy with the cooking 
and the entertaining part of it that they were not that big of drinkers. But 
almost everyone of those Italian families had a gallon jug on the table! ... He 
would take 200/220 cases twice a week." 
Phyllis tells us that her husband hurt his back while taking some cases down 
in the basement and then one day he 'died' in the tank in 1968 from the gas 
produced in it. She recalls the event in details. 
Russell asks how his father learned how to make wine. He worked for the San 
Martin winery for nine years and learned from another Italian, Mike Bo, a 
gifted wine maker who lived on their property before they moved in. He was 
from northern Italy too and Phyllis remembers that he would speak to her in-
laws in their dialect. 
"He taught us everything we know. I became a wine judge because, I guess I was 
born with a good palate, and you develop this. So I tasted everything I could 
possibly taste and I evaluated it and of course because we raised grapes I 
knew what the fresh ones smelled and tasted like." 
They hired a wine maker in 1983, Alan, a chemist from Davis. They had to hire 
him because of the new government regulations. Phyllis says: "You have to know 
the total acids and the sugars and all of these kind of things... In the good 
old days, we just made wine and nobody cared about that... It's a food 
chemistry science, I guess that's the easiest way to explain wine making, food 
chemistry. To get his Master's he (Alan) had to take 
physical chemistry, I don't even know what that means, but he had to have 
it ... our business came to that; I kind of liked it back in the good old days 
when we just did gallon jugs." 
They keep talking and complaining about all the government regulations (which 
other business has to pay federal taxes twice a month?): "Sometimes the 
winery, if it's big enough, will have several people doing nothing but 
government compliances, it's amazing... if it had stayed the good old family 
Italian style, then it was fun. But you cannot earn a living that way anymore. 
We had to progress and when you progress you lose something. I thing we lost 
the best part!" 
Ed explains why it is not worth it anymore to cultivate grapes. 
Then I ask about his mother's cooking. He says she was a wonderful cook. He 
remembers a lot of pasta dishes, turkey and roasts for Christmas. She used to 
make candies with prunes staffed with walnuts and dipped in chocolate and sell 
them on the highway. 
T IAW-PT-A020=Carolyn Tognetti was born on February 8, 1946. Her mother, Gloria 
Rizzi was born on october 11, 1926. 
Gloria starts with the story of her paternal grandparents. Amerigo Ciabattari 
came alone around 1905 leaving his pregnant wife back in Lucca, Italy. He came 
to Gilroy where he had a brother. According to Gloria, California was chosen 
because of the climate very similar to Italy. 
Her maternal grandfather, Frank Bosco, arrived around the same time. He left 
his wife with three children in the little town of Casalino, 10 kilometers 
from Casale Monferrato, Piemonte. He came with the intention of making some 
money and go back to buy land. He came to Gilroy because he had family friends 
here (the Giannelli family of Stockton). Before he was able to send money for 
his family to come to America 15 years went by. He never returned to Italy. He 
worked always in farms. 
Gloria tells the story of her maternal grandmother's trip to America in 1922: 
she was so frightened that she would not let her children be out of sight. 
When they arrived in Ellis Island 
and had to go to the bathroom she had them go all together. Then they took the 
train to Gilroy. The station was then in the Chinese section of town. When 
Gloria's mother (18 years old) got out of the train the first people she saw 
were chinese. "She had never seen them in Italy ... and she turned to my 
grandmother and said 'Is this what the Americans in California look like?'" 
Gloria's grandmother, and the two daughters arrived in the middle of july, the 
height of the canning season, and went to work in the cannery the next day 
after they arrival. 
The family rented a house and after six months they 
bought 22 acres of land. Gloria does not know how they did it, and who would 
lend them the money but "they had a lot of courage," and the whole family 
worked in the farm. The grandfather made wine, the grandmother raised chickens 
and rabbits. 
Both Gloria and Carolyn tell their stories involving a rabbit/pet that their 
mother or grandmother killed for dinner. And the first image that Carolyn saw 
when she visited the Italian town where her maternal grandparents came from 
was the one of a member of the family skinning a rabbitl 
Rabbit was mostly prepared in a stew with polenta; chicken was roasted, not 
fried, with potatoes, carrots, and onions. "Our main meals were chicken, 
rabbit and naturally your pasta, your spaghetti; a lot of rice, because my 
mother's family was Piemontese and they ate more rice than my other 
grandmother from Tuscany." 
Gloria's paternal grandparents had a similar story. Before the grandfather had 
enough money to send for his wife and son (Gloria's father) six years went,by 
(1910 or 1911). Her grandmother could not get a place on the boats leaving 
from Genova; she left from the port of Le Havre in France. From Ellis Island 
she took the train to Gilroy. The first house they rented is still there (near 
the Casa de Fruta on the Pacheco pass); Gloria's grandfather worked for the 
Zanger ranch in Gilroy (the Zangers own now the Casa de Fruta). During the 
first three years three daughters were born. The grandfather worked in several 
places, always farming. Then he was able to buy 25 acres of land, now adjacent 
to the Gavilan college property. The old barn, and tank house are still there 
as well as the house which has been remodeled. Gloria's grandfather sold the 
property (none of his children wanted it) and now is a big subdivision and 
what is interesting for Gloria is that two of her children, Carolyn and Victor 
-1- ,40 j62, 
02 
and their families live there now, on the property that once belonged to their 
great grandfather. 
Gloria talks about her mother and father and their struggle during the 
depression. They both had to work in the cannery so Gloria's Tuscan 
grandmother (Albina Ciabattari) took care Qf her during the week. Because of 
that Gloria learned Italian but she also spoke Italian with her parents. When 
she started school did not speak one word of English. She believes that she 
was the one who taught English to her mother (who came to America when she was 
18) and never had much exposure to English. 
Albina Ciabattari, Gloria's grandmother, never saw her parents who died in 
Italy or her sisters again. Her two sisters, after three years of seasonal 
work in Argentina, married two Argentinean men, and never returned to Italy. 
"I know that many people in Europe in those days had hard and sad stories to 
tell but this is why I'm really proud of being Italian because, even if I was 
born here, I feel that my grandparents and their parents had..things were so 
tough for them and rough for them that to make a living or, as my grandmother 
said, to put food in our mouth, they left and went three, eight thousands 
miles away from their home, and never returned, never went back and they were 
young... They were always proud to be Italian. My father was especially proud, 
so was my grandfather... In those days they used to have Italian newspaper that 
came out from San Francisco and my grandfathers both subscribed to that 
because they always wanted to keep up with the news of Italy. And they always 
wrote to their family and friends, but they felt that they could not get ahead 
there..." 
Side 2 
Gloria continues telling the story of her grandfathers and how they managed to 
acquire land. Their farms were mainly vineyards but Gloria says "they always 
had their 'giardino', their garden and they grew every vegetable 
imaginable... and chickens :..Nonno Ciabattari had a lot of chickens and my 
grandfather used to hunt little birds and my grandmother... she'd make a stew 
out of them and they had polenta. They did not buy too much at the store: they 
had chickens that laid eggs, they grew all their vegetables, my grandmother 
made bread, she had one of those round, dome type, clay ovens that she used to 
go outside and make her own bread. She would make enough bread for a week..." 
I ask when Italian women stopped working at the cannery. Gloria says that they 
worked until they retired. "They worked until they were forced to retire, 
until they were too old ... the women liked that because they worked hard, they 
worked long hours but they made enough money and in the winter they were home 
with their families. And it was sure work, it was always every year ... mostly 
the older Italian women who worked in the cannery were retired because of old 
age ... the younger generation of Italians, my mother used to tell me 'I don't 
want you to work in the cannery ... You go to school and you learn , ... the big 
thing for my mother was to type on a typewriter, and to be a secretary." And 
Gloria learned that and became a secretary. I ask what she would say to her 
brother: she wanted her son to go to college and learn business, and he did. 
Carolyn talks about her father-in-law, Pete Tognetti. He was not always a 
farmer, he drove a truck and then ten years after his marriage he went into 
farming. He was born in the States but his father was from the same town near 
Lucca, Marlia, where Carolyn great-grandfather came from. "I tell my husband 
'Maybe we were related back somehowl' (laugh)" 
We talk about naming tradition: the family names were kept as middle names. 
Gloria learned from her grandparents to make the traditional dishes from 
Piemonte: bagna calda, polenta, risotto alla Milanese, rollatini (swiss steak 
pound out and in the center you put parsley, garlic, and onions, and then you 
roll it up and hold it together with a toothpick or a string), gnocchi. "It's 
interesting that was my grandparents generation, and my parents generation, my 
generation and now my children cook that!" 
She gives me the recipe for bagna calda (or cauda). 
I ask Carolyn if she sees a connection between her involvement with garlic and 
her Italian origins. She says that it was a pure coincidence. Her father was 
not in farming, he was a beer and soda distributor, and her mother, Gloria was 
a secretary. "The farming for me was not even part of my life until I married 
my husband. I was a dental assistant... the first few years that we were 
married he was working with my father selling beer, but he was always wanting 
to go into farming, just did not have the opportunity. His dad had a partner 
at the time he graduated from college and he could not take him in, it was not 
enough money. Then the partner retired and he went into farming with his 
father for a few years..." 
Carolyn's son, Gary, 17 years old, comes into the office. In the summer he 
helped in the garlic harvest. His mother says that he is good at it, but he is 
too young to know if he wants to be a farmer. Carolyn has four children, two 
daughters and two sons: the oldest girl, 23 years old, is a dental hygienist, 
and she is going to get married in october. I ask if the future husband is 
Italian and Carolyn spontaneously says: "No, darn it! No no, don't repeat 
that! He is a nice man, we like him!" The other daughter is 21 and studying to 
become a teacher. About her sons Carolyn says "These boys, I don't know, one 
of them possibly will carry on. I have a feeling will be this one (referring 
to Gary)." 
Carolyn starts to talk about "Garlic World," :"...This ended up to be my 
husband's idea, but it's my baby..it's like babies always are a husband's idea 
and the mother raises them! (laugh)" 
Carolyn tells how she met her husband, Ed Tognetti, and the story of his 
career in farming. He started with his father on 40 acres of land growing 
tomatoes and garlic. 
Carolyn quit her job as dental assistant and started to sell local cherries on 
a little trailer on the highway. At the time they were associated with Don 
Christopher in farming, and he had also a cherry orchard: Don Christopher 
provided the cherries and Carolyn and her husband provided the work. Carolyn's 
in-laws had property on the old 101 highway, at a time when the freeway was 
still going through Gilroy, and they set the trailer on the highway and 
started to sell cherries (Merry Cherry). A few years later the freeway 
bypassed their property; they rented or leased other spots for a few years 
then finally bought the present property (she shows me the aerial view of the 
property which hangs on the wall). Carolyn worked at the fruit stand 
alternating with her mother-in-law for fifteen years. Three years ago (1986) 
they opened "Garlic World". Even if "Merry Cherry" had been their identity for 
15 years, they decided to name the new store differently: " We changed the 
name to garlic because we found with the Merry Cherry, cherry season 
starts... about the first of june and is only a one month season, then we still 
sold cherries that we got from Washington and Oregon, just bought and resold, 
and those went on until the middle of august. But we had peaches that went on 
PT- 14 0 a0 '1 
y 
until now, and corn and other things, so we would keep the fruit stand open 
after we did not have cherries anymore and that was just such a hard thing to 
do because everybody would ask 'where are the cherries,'... people who did not 
know seasons. So ... I hated to give up the name: it was our identity for 
fifteen years but ... let's do garlic. By then in Gilroy the festival had taken 
place, it has been over 11 years now, so it was getting famous for garlic. We 
were doing partners with two garlic growers. Why not, we are going to feature 
a lot of garlic and garlic braids so let's name it something with garlic, 
which we have all year round. And that's how it came to be born, I feel it's 
like my baby, another baby!" 
Carolyn manages the store and even if at the beginning her husband and the 
other partner tried to interfere with her decisions on how to run the business 
she says: "I actually could not have him or my partner in here. They have no 
concept of this kind of work, you know, retail, working with the customers. 
They are out in the fields, they are in marketing, a total different 
concept...I have a lot of family here. The children during high school: my 
son, the one you just met, does work here weekends and works in the summer 
with his dad on the farm; and then the little boy, the eleven years old and my 
nephew come in and they rap garlic and the netting, that's the little job they 
do in the summer. And then my sister-in-law, married to my brother, is in 
charge of my computer, we have a catalogue, so she is in charge of that. Mom 
is her assistant with the computer, sending out catalogues and doing odds and 
ends jobs for me ... Now my sister joined the force over here, she is out in the 
shipping department, packaging the items and shipping out there. My husband's 
aunt ... has worked for me, and my niece... (laughing) it has become quite a 
family!!" 
She employs 32 people, "but they are not all family!" 
Gloria wants to tell me about Carolyn's paternal grandfather: Pete Rizzi (her 
husband's father). He was born in a small village in northern Italy, Cursolo, 
8 miles from the Swiss border, near Domodossola. One of his brothers migrated 
to Colorado and worked in the mines. When Pete was 28 years old decided to 
come to America: "He walked 23 miles to Domodossola where he could catch a 
train, the train to Genova, and he too came over by ship through Ellis 
Island." (continues on IAW-PT-A021') 
TIAW-PT-A021=Continues from IAW-PT-A020 
Pete Rizzi was 20 years old when he arrived in Ellis Island and he had an 
uncle in New Jersey (his father's brother) and stopped to visit him before 
continuing for Colorado where he was going to work in the mines with his 
brother. While he was there he met the girl that his aunt and uncle had 
adopted. She was of Irish descent (red hair and freckles), 17 years old. "He 
naturally fell in love with her, spoke to his aunt and uncle for her hand and 
marriage, they said yes. She did not have anything to say about it, because 
she was 17 years old, almost 18! It was a family arranged marriage. He married 
her right away, within two weeks, I think ... took her with him to Durango, 
Colorado ... and he worked in the coal mines and they had two children there. 
And then from there, they heard that things were better so they moved to 
Ringo, Kansas with these two children, also to work in the coal mines." There 
they bought a house and a few acres of land and they had four more children. 
Gloria says that he feared for the safety of his children, he did not want 
them to work in the mines, so in 1924 he reached his cousin in Gilroy who was 
in the plastering business. "My mother-in-law immediately went to work in the 
cannery also, with six children. The boys were old enough to work in the 
cannery too and the others went out in the fields and picked prunes; and the 
father, Pete Rizzi worked in the plastering business and within two years they 
were able to accumulate enough money to buy a home... she went on to have two 
more children... they all worked in the cannery, they all worked in the fields 
and the father from the day he came to Gilroy until he died worked as a 
plaster. One of the sons also followed into that business." Carolyn adds that 
one of the daughters married the son of the business partner. 
Gloria wanted 
to tell me this story because she felt this was interesting because they did 
not go into agriculture but into plastering and bricklaying. "They encouraged 
(the children) to do well in school. Grandma Rizzi, was always very important 
to her that her children did well and got good grades and studied so that they 
would get higher paid positions and did not have to work in the cannery. She 
worked in the cannery until she was 67 years old." 
Russell and later Ken come in. 
I ask if the families got together to celebrate Christmas and Easter. Gloria 
talks about the Italian-American dlub in Gilroy as "a means of still getting 
the Italians together, but as far as our immediate family always... holidays 
were very important to us, they still are, the family gatherings, I mean: 
anniversaries and birthdays, and Christmas, it's just something... all my 
children had "the big Italian wedding!" 
She defines "a big Italian wedding" as a wedding with a lot of people (around 
300 people): "a lot of dancing, singing, happy times and the Italian candies, 
you know, were always given away as favors." 
Carolyn, whose daughter is getting married in october says that it's changing: 
"My daughter is giving potpourri," instead of the traditional confetti, and 
both women feel bad about it. Carolyn comments: "Americanized, that's what's 
happening!" 
Carolyn summarizes for Russell the evolution of her business from selling 
cherries on the highway to "Garlic World." I ask if she did it for herself and 
she says: "No, not at all. It was my husband's idea and I'm a good Italian 
wife and I do what my husband tells mel (laugh) and then I kick him outl" She 
continues: " He felt that businesswise in his head this was a real good move 
and we should do it. In my head I knew he was right and in my heart I really 
did not want to do it because of the time it would take...I think Italians are 
T 
really into their family a lot." Gloria adds: "I think this business has 
brought her family, having four children from age 24 to 11 and her husband, 
they really work as one unit. The kids, even the little guy the 11 year old 
boy, comes here and work, and her daughter works and yet they are all pursuing 
different careers...I think this business has provided her children with the 
sense of how important is to work: if you want something you have to work for 
it. I was brought up that way, I think I have already given Paola the 
impression that my grandparents knew nothing but work, well, by working you 
become independent and by coming independent you become happy, and you can 
hold your head high anywhere, but you did it yourself, by work. And I feel 
this is what they have instilled in me and I have instilled in her and she has 
instilled in her children and I think it's a good quality." 
We ask if garlic has been associated with Italians as food of the lower social 
classes. Carolyn feels that today garlic is the 'in' thing, associated with 
gourmet food and healthy diet. 
Carolyn talks briefly about the garlic festival, how her partner Don 
Christopher with Rudy Malone were involved in starting the festival. Carolyn 
herself is not involved in the planning of it. Garlic World has a booth at the 
festival and Carolyn has been involved on a voluntary basis, as chair of 
charitable organizations. 
Carolyn and Gloria do not belong to any of the Italian-American organizations. 
Gloria speaks very highly of their activities and celebrations. "I attend 
their functions, I have been invited to their dances, to their dinners, I have 
gone, I don't know why I'm not..I have never been a club person." 
I ask more about the family gatherings. Carolyn remembers the extended family 
getting together at Oakdale park where they had the bocce ball court and they 
always had big picnics. Gloria adds: "There were not reunions or birthdays or 
anything. They were just dates set aside once a year that all these people 
were going to get together. They had a bocce ball tournament, they had 
somebody playing the accordion and singing. Remember grandma and aunt Cary? 
they'd always sing these Italian songs. I used to love to hear them singing. 
Unfortunately I don't know any of the Italian songs, well: "Arrivederci Roma," 
and all the popular ones but they knew the ones when they were young in 
Italy ... As far as reunions our families, Ciabattari side of the family, we go 
up to my brother's and we have family reunions..we have had them with the 
Rizzi side of the family out in the local park and everybody brings food, kind 
of potlatch..." 
Both Gloria and her daughter consider themselves good Italian cooks, and they 
have pasta almost everyday. Gloria gives the recipe for 'torta' (see also 
fieldnotes from our first visit to Jean Conrotto), and recalls the desserts 
that her grandmother from Piemonte used to make. From the Tuscan grandmother 
she learned the recipe for minestrone that she still prepares today following 
her grandmother's recipe (beans, salted pork, and all vegetables). 
Carolyn talks about her daughter's imminent wedding. They are inviting 325 
people, immediate family and friends, excluding second cousins and other 
relatives. The wedding is going to be in the Mission at San Juan Batista and 
the reception is going to be 
at the Monterey Beach Hotel. "The menu had consisted of chicken and rice which 
we have switched to pasta! (laugh) We cannot have rice at an Italian wedding! 
Italians eat rice but not the way they were fixing it! ... We are going to make 
sure that the band plays a couple of Italian songs."

Gloria and Carolyn did not have a trousseau when they got married and 
Carolyn's daughter does not have it either. She bought for her an electric 
blanket and the negligee. When Carolyn was in Venice, Italy she bought two 
tablecloths with worklace for her two daughters to use on the cake table at 
their wedding and to keep afterwards: "a little bit of Italyl" 
:PT- 140 •• . / 
T IAW-PT-A022=Sonia Bertolone, her brother Michael, the Spanish student who is 
staying at their house and me are in the car driving to San Francisco under a 
torrential rain. 
Sonia was born in Albenga, province of Savona. Her family moved to Gilroy in 
1977 when she was 6 years old. They left from the airport in Milan. Sonia 
remembers her mother had somebody make matching outfits for the children which 
they wore for the trip. She remembers playing in the snow outside the airport 
before leaving. The parents had residency already. Sonia tells me that they 
can get citizenship whenever they want but she goes: "Never, NE-VER! I will 
never give up my Italian citizenship." 
Sonia's uncle, her father's brother lived in San Jose at the time and he had a 
pizzeria in Gilroy called "Caesar's." Sonia's father invested all his money 
(before leaving Italy he had sold his vegetable store, his two condominiums, 
and a villa) with his brother in real estate. "At the time if you would have 
invested all that money, by now he would have been retired. Things just did 
not work out with my uncle Michael." Sonia's father trusted his brother but he 
put the property under his name and Joe could not prove that the money was his 
own without getting in trouble with Italy for illicit exportation of money.
