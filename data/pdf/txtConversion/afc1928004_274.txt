We danc'd till de morning light was seen, 
Way down in flyer's hall! 
Dere was Susie Simms, and George, and Pete, 
And all de boys from Wooster street ; 
And Marfa Jane, she look'd so sweet, 
At de gay old nigger ball.

We heard all de music gay and sweet, 
It put de shivers in our feet ; 
We laugh'd and we jumped in joy complete, 
Till on de floor we'd fall. 
Dere was " Poppy Horace " wid his " lamb," 
De people wonders who she am ; 
She looked just like a

At de gay old nigger ball.

De belle of de ball was Angeline, 
And I, of course, was " bellgerine 
But she was so fat, and I

We could not dance at all! 
When de morning came, we all was tight ! 
And some got sick, and some did fight ;

At de gay old nigger ball!

CHARACTERS—UNCLE BILLY, PETE, JAKE, JOE and JIM. 
Dress to 
suit the performers. 
[Scene, a room. 
PETE, JAKE, JOE and Jut discovered. 
Banjo hanging on the wall.] 
PETE.—Joe, can't you take down the old Cremona once 
more, and let's have one more dance before we go? 
Just to 
get your hand in. 
JOE.—Don't care if I 
do. 
Anything to keep up the racket, 
[Takes down banjo.] Now, boys, give us the heel-taps. [Plays 
and JAKE, PETE and JIM dance.] 
PETE.—Play that tune Uncle Billy used to freeze to. 
[JOE 
plays the air, " Oh, Poor Old Man," at first pretty briskly, gra-
dually more and more slowly and faintly.] 
JIM. — That makes a 
feller's eyes water. 
How I 
wish old 
Uncle Bill was here. 
He used to love to be with the boys. 
JOE. 
Uncle Bill ? 
Why, he must be done gone long ago. 
I 
think I 
see him now. How he could sing, too. 
He went 
away five years ago last Christmas eve. 
Just five years ago 
to-night. 
JAKE.— Why, he taught me the first step I 
ever knew. 
PETE.—Yes, and me too. 
They couldn't beat him much on 
heel and toe-ology. 
Could they, Jakey? 
JAKE.—Not much. 
PETE.—Then he was so good-natured. 
JOE.— What tricks we used to play on the old man. 
JAKE.—Yes ; 
do you remember when we filled an old hat 
with bricks, and turned it upside down on the ground before 
Uncle Billy's door ? 
He made a 
kick at it, and then you ought 
to have heard him squeal. 
Ha! ha I 
! 
ha! 
J131.—But he was so good-natured. 
JOE.—Then do you remember how well we fooled him with 
the dinner horn? 
PETE.—Yes; when we filled it up with mud. 
JOE.—Ha! ha! 
Who ever saw such a 
face when he got 
through blowing! 
JAKE.—'Twas a 
shame to worry the old man. 
I'd lik& to 
see him once more.

PETE.—Wouhin't it be a

JAKE.—Anyhow, not from such a 
good-natured ghost as 
Uncle Billy. 
Why, he wouldn't hurt a 
fly. 
[Knock heard 
outside.] 
ALL (
startled).—Wbo that? [Knock repeated.] 
JIM.—
Who—who--who's that knocking at the kitchen 
door? 
JOE.—I 
aint a 
bit frightened; but I'm gone down the street. 
Good bye, boys. [Exit JOE.] 
ALL.—Oh, he's a 
coward. [Knock outside.] 
Jnr.—I'm a 
good mind to follow Joe. 
I hate to let him go 
alone. 
Not that I'm a 
bit scared. 
Oh, no! 
PETE.—That must be Uncle Billy's ghost! I—I—I 
think 
I'll leave you, Jake, to keep him company. 
JAKE.—Not if I 
know myself. 
No ghosts for me. 
Let's go 
together. [Exit PETE and JAKE.] 
[Air of "Poor Old Man" played plaintively as UNCLE BILL 
enters.] 
UNCLE BILL (
looking round).—Nobody home? I 
thought 
I 
heard voices. 
Can it be possible that these old ears of mine 
have deceived me? I've been away from home just five years 
this very Christmas eve. 
Alt, that's a 
long time to wander up 
and down the world. 
Maybe the folks are all dead. 
Shouldn't 
wonder. 
Most time for the old man to turn up his toes to the 
roots of the daisies. 
I 
suppose I'm forgotten. 
[Lays down his 
valise.] 
Everything looks so natural. [Sees banjo.] 
Ali, they 
aint all dead here!

JAKE.—W hy, we took you for a

JIM.— How d'ye do, Uncle Billy ? 
JOE.—Why, you came very nigh scaring us. 
PETE.—Old man, how do you find yourself? Where have 
you been ? 
UNCLE BILLY.—Oh, I've wandered up and down a 
heap 
since I 
saw you. 
But I'm as good and as fine as a 
cotton hat, 
if I 
am broke. 
How's all the boys and gals? 
Jaicv.—Oh, they're all alive and kicking. 
UNCLE BILLY.—Well, boys, won't you dance and play for 
the old man, just for old times' sake. 
ALL—Give us a 
song yourself, Uncle Billy. 
JOE.— Sing to us about yourself,

OH! POOR OLD MAN.—[CoNcLuDrna 
And when I 
grew up I 
was sent to a 
school. 
And we say so, and we hope so. 
Cos I 
couldn't learn they said I 
was a 
fool. 
Oh! poor old man! 
My skin was white, and I 
was fair before they took to teaching me; 
I 
always cried, and never tried to learn my alphabet; 
I 
used to drink the ink, I 
think, as they were always beating me, 
'Twas through my skin the ink worked in, and made me black as 
jet. 
Oh I 
b'lieve me, ike. 
I 
had many sweethearts when I 
was young and strong. 
And we say so, and we hope so. 
But now all the girls laugh and say go along. 
Oh! poor old man! 
I 
once did love a 
pretty girl, and promised I 
would marry her, 
I 
bought the ring, and everything was ready for the day; 
And when the day arrived I 
allied, and hope to church Pd carry 
her, 
She'd slop'd, elop'd, gone, done, and run with another man away. 
Oh! b'lieve me, 4:c. 
If I 
had the cash I 
would treat you all round. 
And we say so, and we hope so. 
But in my pockets not a 
penny to be found. 
Oh poor old man! 
But listen while I 
tell you what my little brother Jimmy did, 
Tie borrowed all my money for to speculate, you know; 
He put it in a 
bank whose liabilities was limited, 
'Twas very rash, the bank went smash, and settled my poor bash. 
Oh I 
b'lieve me, &c. 
My story is done, so now I'll go away. 
And we say so, and we hope so. 
For nobody here seems to mind what I 
say. 
Oh! poor old man 
Well, now you know my woes, I 
s'pose you feel inclined to pity 
me, 
I 
guess you must confess that Pm the unluckiest of men. 
But, oh, I 
see you don't mind me, but just want to get rid o' me, 
Well, anyhow I'm going now, but I 
will come again. 
Oh! blieve me, &c.

An emblem of devotion, was sent to me, I'm sure, 
By one whose heart is true, and I

As from a 
fairy bower, rich blessings on my love.

Oa my heart doth show'r rich blessings on my love. 
This pretty little flower, pluck'd (ruin its dewy bed, 
In softly breathing whispers, unto my heart has said: 
What tho' all else be false, there's one e'er true to thee 1" 
Oh ! this pretty little flower brings joy and peace to me. 
Yes, this pretty little flow'r, I'll prize it from this hour,

I OFTEN DREAM OF _WELLY GRAY. 
I 
OFTEN dream of .Nelly Gray, who left me lona ago; 
Her features I 
forget by day, at night full well I 
know— 
Then years flow back, I'm young again, new hopes my bosom 
cheer, 
I 
carol forth a 
joyous strain in gentle Nelly's ear. 
Then years flow, etc. 
..AIy face is stern, my glance is cold, an iron man I 
seem ; 
I 
have no wish except tOr 
not so when I 
dream— 
Then wealth is turned to useless dross by memory's burning 
ray ; 
Then I 
regain my heart's great loss—I 
see dear Nelly Gray. 
Then wealth is turned, etc. 
And in my dreams there is a 
truth, all wakinc, dreams above— 
Dental are those days of youth that sloweil with Nelly's love; 
All e:se will fads before mine eyes, the world will melt away, 
But near my pillow, when I 
die, will linger Nelly Gray. 
All else will fade, etc.

OF 
all the pretty little blondes 
That ever walked the stage, 
There's one, I'll call her Nellie,

And her back is ornamented 
With a

The first time that I 
met her 
She wore a 
swinging switch, 
This beautiful, this charming girl, 
This pretty little witch.

Her manners are serene, 
Her teeth of pearly whiteness 
Are the nicest I 
have seen; 
Her voice at times is mellow, 
Again it's pure and rich, 
But the sweetest thing about her 
Is what golden swinging switch. 
The first time, etc. 
She skips before the footlights with 
An air of grace and ease, 
She sings like a 
canary, 
And is always sure to please; 
Admirers, they are many, 
They applaud the little witch, 
And when she gets an encore, then 
Oh don't she toss the switch.

W HEN the sun of prosperity's shining, 
And man's growing richer each day, 
When in ease and in comfort reclining, 
And golden success crowns his way, 
flow friends then will gather around him ! 
But if fortune should happen to frown, 
He finds that his former " good fellows" 
Will kick him as soon as he's down. 
CHORUS . 
When poor and astray a 
man's in the way, 
He meets all around him a 
frown ; 
Then reckless and sad, he " goes to the bad," 
Because he is kick'd when he's down. 
How kindly the world smiles upon him 
When life with successes abounds; 
How blandly each neighbor will greet him 
As in pleasure he's riding around ; 
But then let reverse overtake him, 
And his friends, both in country and town, 
Have not a 
kind sentence to cheer him. 
But will kick him as soon as he's down. 
When poor and astray, etc. 
Let a 
man get position and riches— 
No matter by right or by fraud— 
The world nods approvinoly on him, 
And loudly his creatures applaud ; 
But just let him lose all his treasures, 
Tho' before he was full of renown, 
The people find out be has fallen, 
And then let him die when he's down. 
When poor and astray, etc. 
0, why is all mankind so selfish 7 
We know it should never be thus ; 
Then why can't we do to our neiohbors 
As we would have them do to us 7 
And if in " adversity's ocean " 
We are sinking and ready to drown, 
Twice blest is the friend whose devotion 
Will help a man up when he's down. 
When poor and astray, etc.

THERE'S a 
charming young fellow now roaming about, 
Who loves all the girls in his way ; 
They say he's a" catch" but of that there's a 
doubt, 
For a 
single young man he will stay. 
He flirts and sighs, and tells such lies, 
Each one is sure she has a 
prize ; 
And he has such a 
naughty way, 
That one girl to another will say : 
Beware! beware! beware ! 
ctiontw. 
He isn't a 
marrying man, my love, • 
He lives on a 
different plan, my love ; 
Keep out of his way if you can, my love, 
For he isn't a 
marrying man. 
There's old Mrs. Brown with a 
daughter so sweet, 
She thought him an excellent beau ; 
She allowed Mary Jane his attentions to meet, 
And told her to never say no I 
But then there came a " mutual friend," 
With tales that seemed to have no end ; 
These warning words she heard with pain : 
" 
Believe me what I 
say, Mary Jane— 
Beware, beware, beware !" 
He isn't, etc. 
He dresses with care, and he's known ey'rywhere, 
He goes with the rich and the poor ; 
Sometimes he will drive a 
poor girl to despair, 
Till she thinks his affections are sure. 
But by-and-by, away he'll fly, 
And there she's left to droop and sigh, 
With sympathetic voices near 
To whisper these words in her ear— 
" 
Beware, beware, beware!" 
He isn't, etc.

I STARTED in the race of life 
With hopes and fancies mountain high; 
I 
won the fight in ev'ty strife, 
And left my hopes no chance to die; 
Great fortunes I 
have made and lost, 
And o'er the world I've rambled far, 
While ev'rywhere it was my boast 
To own a 
bright and " lucky star."

The " Big Bonanza" I 
behold; 
I've labor'd long and travell'd far; 
But now I 
see my dream of gold, 
And bless my bright and " lucky star." 
I'll buy a 
mansion big and grand, 
And spend my fortune gay and free; 
And gladly fill the beggar's hand— 
There's plenty in the world for me; 
I'll speculate withoiit a 
fear 
Of " Bulls " or " Bears' opposing war, 
And while I 
win their gold so dear, 
I'll bless my bright and " lucky star." 
The " Big Bonanza," etc. 
I'll search around my social sphere, 
And fall in love with some sweet maid; 
For love alone can cheer my home— 
The " Bia Bonanza" gives me aid; 
And when I'm wed and settled down, 
And voices round me cry " Papa!" 
I'll bless the day so far away 
When first I 
saw my " lucky star."

POOR AND GAY; 
OR, " IT M ORT 'LANE BEEN W O.RSE." 
Words by HARRY HUNTER.. 
Music by VINCENT DAVIES. 
MY 
old sire in Leicestershire 
Kept a 
little farm, 
And though ourlamily was iarge, 
lie shielded us from harm ; 
And this is what he always said, 
When fortune was perverse, 
" 
It's bad, my lad, but not so bad 
But what it might be worse. 
It's bad, my lad, but not so bad 
But what it might be worse." 
CHORUS. 
I'll be jolly and say 
I'm poor, but I'm gay, 
And my heart is as light as my purse, 
For whatever my lot, 
It surely is not 
So bad but it might have been worse. 
When I 
left my father's roof 
To earn my daily bread, 
Misfortune put me to the proof, 
But steadfastly I 
said, 
I 
have been taught that life is fraught 
With trouble and reverse, 
And thus advised I'm unsurprised, 
And know it might be worse. 
I'll be jolly, etc. 
With hardy will I 
struggled till 
Prosperity I 
knew, 
But poverty again stepped in, 
And friends again were few ; 
But still I 
wish for friends like this, 
I 
penned no mournful verse, 
No tear I 
shed, but sang instead, 
I 
know it might be worse. 
I'll be jolly, etc. 
Contentedly I 
still progress, 
Althou2h the way is rough, 
And if but little I 
possess, 
That little is enouffh ; 
The old resource will always force 
My sorrows to disperse, 
For come what, may, I 
still shall say, 
I 
know it might be worse. 
I'll be jolly, etc. 
WILL A MONKEY CLIMB A TREE ? 
Written and composed by JOHN REED, and sung by Gus Wiraisms. 
W HILST walking out the other night a 
girl I 
chanced to meet, 
A 
very simple looking lass, as I 
thought, in the street; 
She had a 
lovely head of hair, a 
dark and rolling eye ; 
I 
ask'd her if she'd walk with me, and this was her reply— 
CHORUS. 
Will a 
monkey climb a 
tree 7 
will a 
fish swim in the sea 7 
Will a 
lawyer take his fee'? a 
Jew his money lose 
Will a 
hackman take his fare 7 
will a 
barber cut your hair 7 
If they say no, then, dear sir, you I 
will refuse. 
I 
thought her very witty, so I 
to her did say, 
" 
Will you go to a 
music hall to pass an hour away 7 
Now, miss, what do you say to this 7 
your answer, yes or no '
I 
Just tell me what you really think, and if you'd like to go." 
SPOKEN.—" Will I 
accompany you?" she said; " why "— 
Will a 
monkey, etc. 
I 
hired a 
hack, drove to the hall, and paid the man his fare, 
And when we got inside the ball saw the chairman in his chair. 
I 
shook him by the hand and said, " What will you have with 
me— 
Whiskey hot or brandy cold or a 
glass of soda and B.7" 
SPON E.N.—" Will I 
take a 
glass of brandy and water, did you 
say 7 Oh !"— 
Will a 
monkey, etc. 
A 
waiter then he brought the drinks, which came to a 
dollar 
and four, 
The same time saying, " Sir, will you require any more 7" 
gave him a 
ten dollar piece, be looked at me so strange; 
I 
then said to the waiter, " Will you aecept the change 7" 
SPOKEN. — He first looked at the gold piece and then at 
and quickly putting the coin in his pocket, exclaimed— 
Will a 
monkey, etc.

TTTF. MONEYLESS MAN. 
Rs 
IIEN:ay STANTON. 
Is there no place on the face of the earth 
Where charity dwelleth, where virtue has birth! 
Where bosoms in kindness and mercy will heave, 
And the poor and the wretched shall ask and receivel N., 
Is there no place on earth where a 
knock from the poor 
Will bring a 
kind angel to open the door ? 
Ali! search the wide world wherever you can, 
There is no open door for the moneyless man. 
Go look in the hall where the chandelier light 
Drives off with its splendor the darkness of night; 
Where the rich hanging velvet, in shadowy fold, 
Sweeps gracefully down with its trimmings of gold, 
And mirrors of silver take up and renew 
in long lighted vistas the ' wildering, view; 
Go there in your patches,and find if you can 
A welcoming smile for the moneyless man. 
Go look in your church of the cloud-reaching spire, 
Which gives back to the sun his same look of fire, 
Where the arches and columns are gorgeous within, 
And the walls seem as pure as a 
soul without sin; 
Go down the long aisle—see the rich and the great, 
In the pomp and the pride of their worldly estate; 
Walk down in your patches, and find if you can, 
Who opens a 
pew for a 
moneyless man. 
Go to your judges, in dark flowing gown, 
With the scales wherein law layeth quietly down; 
Where he frowns on the weak and smiles on the strong, 
And punishes right while he justifies wrong; 
Where jurors their lips on the Bible have laid, 
To render a 
verdict they've already made; 
Go there in the court-room, and find if you can, 
Any law for the case of a 
moneyless man. 
Go look in the banks, where Mammon has told 
His hundreds and thousands of silver and gold ; 
Where, safe from the hands of the starving and poor, 
Lie piles upon piles of the glittering ore; 
Walk up to the counter—and there you may stay, 
Till your limbs have grow old and your hair turns gray, 
And you'll find at the bank not one of the clan 
With money to lend to a 
moneyless man. 
(1) 
THE MONEYLESS MAN.—Concluded. 
Then go to your hovel !—no raven has fed 
The wife who has suffered so long for her bread; 
Kneel down by her pallet and kiss the death frost 
From the lips of the angel your poverty lost— 
Then turn in your agony upward to God, 
And bless while it smites you, the chastening rod; 
And you'll find at the end of your life's little span, 
There's a 
welcome above for the moneyless man. 
JANE AND JEREMIAH. 
I'vE come this evening to complain 
Of the treatment of a 
girl call'd Jane, 
With eyes and hair as brown as a 
nut, 
Whose business place it was in the Cut; 
Penny ices there she sold, 
But like her trade her heart it was cold, 
Her each night I 
hear in a 
dream 
Cry," Lemon ice, raspberry or cream!" 
CHORUS . 
I never shall forget that girl 
Whom all the chaps admire, 
Nor yet the names and little games 
Of Jane and Jeremiah I 
She used to drive a 
roaring trade, 
And in the ice line money made, 
She turned them out so very nice, 
I 
lived on nothing else but ice; 
But on this fare I 
grew so thin, 
That I 
was merely bone and skin, 
And after all she told me flat, 
She liked a 
fellow short and fat. 
I 
never shall, etc, 
She said that in the summer days, 
The ice line is a 
trade that pays, 
But in the winter, when it's cold, 
There's very little to be sold. 
She met a 
man called Jeremiah, 
Who kept a 
brazier full of fire, 
And who dealt, in the winter time, 
In baked chestnuts and elder wine. 
I 
never shall, eta.

And you can tell when I'm about, 
For you can hear me cry—

To win her then I'll try ; 
With fortune made we'll then retire, 
No more you'll hear me cry—

WHEN playing ball the fellows use 
A 
phrase that's just the thing 
To say to pretty damsels, that 
Are always on the wing ; 
It is not all the used up slang, 
Nor " how is that for high," 
But simply is, and nothing more, 
Why, " catch it on the fly." 
CHORUS. 
So if you would succeed, my boys, 
In getting what goes by, 
Just throw your shoulders back, my boys, 
And " catch it on the fly." 
While passing down the street at night, 
A 
girl may say to you, 
"Tis chartnima, ain't it, George, dear 1" 
Or " Gus, how do you do'?" 
Some pretty little flirt, perchance, 
May wink her cunning eye, 
And should you like to walk with her, 
Why, " catch it on the fly." 
So if, etc. 
If on a 
Sunday afternoon 
You at a 
window sit, 
It's no one's bus'ness I 
am sure 
If you should flirt a 
bit; 
But should the female throw a 
kiss 
As she went tripping by, 
'Tis worthless to you lest, my boy, 
You " catch it on the fly." 
So if, etc. 
Now, friends, my little song is done, 
I 
hope there is no cause 
For you to sit in quietness, 
Or hold hack your applause ; 
If in my dancina you should see 
Some step you'd like to try. 
Why, call toe back and have them all, 
But " catch them on the fly."

TOOK a 
stroll the other night, 
To see my sweetheart fair, 
When underneath an awning wide 
I 
spied sweet auburn hair ; 
The wearer was a 
charming miss, 
So, her good graces to win, 
I 
raised my hat, when she replied, 
" 
Oh, Nixey, that's too thin." 
CHORUS. 
Oh, wasn't it a 
cruel act ? 
Oh, wasn't it a 
sin, 
To treat me so by saying thus, 
" 
Oh, Nixey, that's too thin." 
Of course I 
felt the sad reproach, 
But wandered on awhile, 
When soon I 
was accosted with 
A 
most bewitching smile; 
Her kindness to reciprocate, 
oave my killing grin, 
But oh, she hollered out aloud, 
" 
Oh, Nixey, that's too thin." 
Oh, wasn't it, ete. 
Determined to proceed along, 
And let the girls alone, 
I 
soon was met by one, who said 
Her " hubby dear had flown ;" 
She grasped me tightly by the arm, 
And asked me for the " tin," 
But on refusing her, she said, 
" 
Oh, Nixey, that's too thin." 
Oh, wasn't it, etc. 
At lost I 
reached my Dora's house, 
The clock was striking ten, 
She from the attic window criei,

Oh, wasn't it, etc. 
Now, gentlemen, take my advice, 
And pass all " cousins " by, 
Unless you have a

Oh, pray, etc. 
Oh, pray, sir ; throw your whiskey out,

Appeal in vain to you ;

In homes about the town, 
Oh, pray, sir, throw your " Bitters " out, 
And take your sign-board down.

,SAM ,IYLOORE'S LAMENT. 
As I 
happened in the city one fine evening, 
I 
took a 
little ramble down the street, 
When a 
splendid lookin' chap came up and asked me 
If I 
remembered when we last did meet. 
I 
told him that I 
had no recollection 
Of ever having seen his phiz before, 
And he gave me then a 
mighty close imspection, 
And he said, " my friend, I 
guess your name is Moore." 
ononus. 
Oh, yes, said I, my name is Samuel Moore, sir, 
I 
hail right from the sunny hills of Pike, 
My dad be used to keep the village store, sir, 
And I 
have five sisters and a 
brother Ike. 
Then he told me that he knew all my relations, 
And that his uncle's brother was my dad, 
And from his many friendly intimations, 
I'm sure I 
thought he was a 
bully lad ; 
But when he asked me, " How is your sister Lizzie V' 
I 
knew he was my long lost cousin Jim, 
And he took me in a 
place that made me dizzy, 
And he told me all that style belonged to him. 
Oh, yes, etc. 
Then be asked me if I'd play a 
game Called Keno, 
But I 
told him that I'd never yet learned how; 
I 
said I 
could play nothin' else but euchre, 
Which I'd learned on Sundays in the barley mow; 
Just then in rushed some fellows dressed so funny, 
And quickly cousin Jim put out the light, 
And now I'm left without a 
cent of money, 
For with it cousin Jim has taken flight. 
CITORUS. 
Oh, yes, I 
say, my name is Samuel Moore, sir, 
And I 
wish that I 
was back in sunny Pike; 
I 
would be contented in my daddy's store, sir, 
And I'd never play except with brother Ike.

SKELLY.

York. 
Price 10 cents. 
I'LL go back to my old love again, 
She will smile and forgive me I 
know, 
Ev'ry day brings me sorrow and pain, 
And I'm weary where ever I 
go. 
While we live thus apart there's a 
sigh in my heart, 
And I 
try to be glad, but in vain ; 
There's a 
sweet voice that whispers to me, 
" 
You must go to your old love again.", 
CHORUS. 
I'll go back again, 
I'll go back again, 
And remove from my heart all its pain; 
In my sorrow no more I 
shall roam, 
I'll go back to my old love again. 
Once again I 
will sit by her side, 
And the light of her smile will be mine, 
And the love which my absence denied, 
Will be brought back in gladness divine. 
We will kiss and forgive, and in future will live 
Far away from all sorrow and pain ; 
Oh ! the thought brings me hope and delight, 
I'll go back to my old love again. 
I'll go back again, etc. 
She will sing all the songs of the past, 
Which have echoed so long in my heart, 
I 
remember the sweet spell they cast, 
All around me that ne'er would depart. 
Many days since have fled, but the dream is not dead, 
While I 
live it will always remain; 
There is joy in the future for me, 
For I'll soon see my old love again. 
I'll go back again, etc.

THE mill's shut down to-day, dear wife, 
There's nothing here to eat, 
And look, the boots I've worn a 
year 
Are dropping off my feet; 
My clothes are hardly decent, wife, 
While you are ragged, too, 
And famine stares us in the face, 
Oh! what are we to do ? 
Oh! what arewe to do, dear wife, 
I 
cannot get my pay ? 
The grocer's bill is overdue, 
The mill's shut down to-day. 
The mill shut down to-day, dear wife, 
The coal is nearly gone, 
And see, there's scarcely wood enough 
To kindle in the morn; 
The landlord will be coming soon 
To get the rent from you, 
And I 
have not a 
cent to pay 
The bills becoming due. 
Oh! what, etc. 
The mill shut down to-day, dear wife, 
The snow is on the ground, 
And hark ! the piercing winds without, 
How mournfully they sound ; 
The children have no shoes to wear, 
They cry for milk and bread, 
But, wife, the mills have stopped to-day, 
How shall we all be fed ? 
Oh ! what, etc;

I'LL ne'er forget the parting kiss 
She gave me at the gate 
One evening fine in summer time, 
As it was growing late. 
She said that we must separate 
That night, and never more 
Should I 
escort her out to walk, 
Or cross her cottage door.

I'll ne'er forget the parting kiss 
She gave me at the gate; 
It shattered my once manly‘heart, 
My grief I 
can't relate. 
I 
asked her why she acted so, 
And pleaded, but in vain, 
For her to stop her foolish talk 
And not say that again ; 
She only laugh'd, and quickly said, 
" 
My dear, ' tis getting late, 
So I 
must take a 
parting kiss 
Before I 
shut the gate." 
I'll ne'er forget, etc. 
I 
loved her as none other loved, 
I 
tried my best to please, 
And thought I 
had a 
comforter 
My later days to ease; 
But bow deceived in her I 
was 
That evening at the gate, 
When I 
received the parting kiss 
That burned my cheek with hate. 
I'll ne'er forget, etc.

'Min the throng of busy people 
In the streets from morn till night, 
Little bootblack earns his living 
With his brush and polish bright ; 
Eyes of cunning ever watching 
For a 
pair from two to nine, 
Voice that never tires of crying, 
" 
Mister, don't yer want a 
shine 7" 
CHORUS. 
Shine yer boots, shine yer boots; 
Walk up, gentlemen, 
give yer all a 
shine; 
Shine yer boots, shine yer boots; 
Walk up, don't wait, I'll suit yer ev'ry time. 
In the cold of snowy winter, 
And the summer's torrid heat, 
Little bootblack waits his chances 
To improve the people's feet ; 
He will spy you at a 
distance 
if you look a 
trifle fine, 
And you can't resist the pleading, 
" 
Mister, don't yer want a 
shine?" 
Shine your boots, etc. 
Tho' his cheeks are always spotted 
With the color of his trade, 
Little bootblack labor's honest 
For the money he has made ; 
Bits of mischief are a 
relish 
When the urchin goes to dine, 
But ' tis over when he's crying, 
" 
Mister, don't yer want a 
shine 7" 
Shine yer boots, etc. 
'Mongst this class of little workers 
Some will see a 
brighter day, 
Little bootblack has a 
future, 
Though but now a 
gentle ray ; 
Cast no malice in his pathway, 
Or his " faiiinos " undermine, 
Make a 
way for him who echoes, 
" 
Mister, don't yer want a 
shine 1" 
Shine yer boots, etc.

THE LITTLE JACKDAW'S NOTE.—Concluded. 
AN 
Author sat in a 
dismal room, 
And he frown'd a 
number of times, 
For he had written a 
song upon Barham's Idea, 
Of the little Jackdaw of Rheims ; 
The words were done, but alas ! the oshance 
Of a 
sale seem'd most remote, 
For he wanted a 
chorus, but couldn't think 
Of the little Jackdaw's note. 
CHORUS 
Quar! quar! quar I 
And he " quar'd" till he hurt his throat, 
And he " quar'd " till he was black in the face, 
But he couldn't get the Jackdaw's note. 
A Composer soon came rushing in, 
And a 
wondrous man was he, 
But, bless you, he couldn't tell his friend 
What a 
Jackdaw's note might be. 
They put their heads together and caw'd 
Almost every sort of caw, 
And a 
course of caws was tried, of course, 
In the cause of the little Jackdaw. 
guar! guar I 
quar 1 
etc. 
They tore their hair, and they tried again, 
And a 
terrible oath they swore, 
They would find out the little Jackdaw's note, 
If they caw'd for ever more. 
They tried the cry of the Owl, and the Wren, 
The Magpie, as well as the Stoat, 
But the more they tried the further they seem'd 
From the little Jackdaw's note. 
Quar I 
quar 
guar! etc. 
They seized their hats and rush'd to the door. 
For 'twas more than they could bear, 
They would find out the little Jackdaw's note, 
Although they were not clear where; 
They would find it out or die, and so 
At the first public house they saw, 
They drank " Success," in a 
brimming glass, 
" 
To the note of the little Jackdaw." 
Quar I 
guar I 
guar! etc. 
I 
don't know how they spent their time, 
But I 
know the clock struck ' four," 
The moon shone brightly upon the scene, 
And it shone on the Author's door; 
It shone, beside, on two figures there, 
Who, speaking from husky throats, 
Requested the lamp post to give ' em change 
For a 
couple of Jackdaw's notes. 
Quar! guar 
quar ! etc. 
Now where they discover'd the Jackdaw's notes 
I 
really can't explain, 
But this I 
know, on the following day 
They'd forgotten them again; 
And their wives, than whom two nicer women 
I'm sure you never saw, 
Made some cutting remarks about Jackasses notes, 
Quite a 
different bird to Jackdaw. 
Quar 1

TH 
E 
band was playing in the park 
One August evening fine, 
And crowds of promenaders gay 
Were marching by in line ; 
The fellows in full force were there, 
The girls were plenty, too, 
And with flirtations, chats, and such, 
All had enough to do. 
CHORUS. 
But I 
was harnessed to my love, 
Who now and then would say, 
" 
That lady seems to know you, George, 
Who is she, tell me, pray 7" 
The ladies, bless the gentle doves, 
Al! seemed to bow to me, 
Which, with Louisa by my side, 
Did not at all agree ; 
And one, believe it, nudged me hard, 
I 
did not know her name, 
Or even the direction which 
The little damsel came. 
But I 
was, etc. 
I 
told my love that it was rude, 
For we'd ne'er met before, 
And then I 
said, " I'm sure she's not 
The style that I 
adore." 
Besides, I 
thought her impudent 
For doing such a 
thing., 
And then the band struck up the air 
My darling loved to sing. 
But I 
was, etc. 
1 
scarce bad got the sentence out 
When, lo, behold! there stood 
A 
maiden throwing kisses just 
As fast as e'er she could ; 
She aimed them all at me I 
know, 
For in her roguish eye 
I 
saw ' twas her intention then 
To toss them on the sly.

But I 
was, etc. 
"THAT LADY SEEMS TO KNOW YOU, 
GEORGE ?"—Concluded. 
Apologize again I 
must 
To my Louisa fair, 
Lest she should think that I 
for her 
Did not the slightest care ; 
I 
told her jokingly I 
thought 
The kisses flew too high 
For me or any other chap 
To catch them on the fly. 
But I 
was, etc. 
This rather vexed the little one, 
She wanted to go home, 
She was " so tired and sleepy that 
She could no further roam 
But ' ere we reached her domicile, 
A 
girl bewitching sweet, 
Said, as she passed aside us, " George, 
Next Sunday night we meet." 
But I

A 
rose red was placed on her breast, 
Her coffin was strewn with camelias

That she wished me not to repeat;

While walking through the grove, 
By what she said, I

The one I 
dearly love. 
There's sunshine in her smile, 
Her eyes with beauty beam; 
So fresh and fair, with nut-brown hair, 
I 
saw her in my dream. 
And as each day goes by, 
My every thought is of 
This lovely girl with teeth like pearl, 
The one I 
dearly love. 
She told me, etc. 
I 
have something else to tell, 
Which always makes me laugh; 
She sent a 
note, in which she wrote, 
"I want your photograph."

She's now my wife, through care and strife,

They wonder'd at my wild delight; 
But would I

The dance seems strangely dull to me,

THERE'S many mottoes in this world 
And good ones too, I 
know, 
But then we don't live up to them, 
For charity is slow ; 
To help the needy now and then 
Is showing best of pluck, 
So we will name the motto now, 
" 
Just try it once for luck." 
Deal kindly with the needy ones 
And show a 
little pluck. 
See that they are provided for, 
" 
Just try it once for luck." 
When e'er you see upon the street. 
An old or crippled man, 
Who asks for alms as you go by, 
Do help him if you can ; 
And should a 
ragged child approach, 
Don't act the " dandy buck," 
But hand a 
little trifle out, 
".Just try it once for luck." 
Deal kindly, etc. 
If ask'd to aid a 
noble cause, 
Why, do it with a 
will, 
For there is nothing gained at all 
By worshipping the till ; 
There's always room for doing good 
Where poverty has strudk, 
So make your mind and say you will

W HILE going to the matinee the other afternoon, 
I 
pass'd, of course, upon the road, a 
gentlemen's saloon, 
A 
lot " nobby " boys were there, as usual " dressed to kill," 
Their corporations look'd as tho' they all had had their fill; 
Each fellow had a 
flashy tie or bow about his neck, 
While all were eating toothpicks by the gallon, quart or peck ; 
Just then, a 
short and portly chap, more cheeky then the rest, 
Stepp'd up and said, " Good evening, miss, you look your very 
best." 
CHORUS. 
No, no, no, not if I 
know it, not if I 
know it, no, 
On me you can't play sugar sweet, so get right up and go. 
At last I 
reached the theatre not much like one forsook, 
For I 
was " lauahing in my sleeve" about the chap I " shook ;" 
The audience was very large, the men were plenty too, 
But luckily I 
had a 
seat where they were very few; 
An empty chair beside me answered for my parasol, 
When lo, the usher ushered in a 
gent both lean and tall; 
He'd scarce been there a 
moment when he whispered in my ear, 
" 
Ha, ha, I've caught you, darling one—my love, how came you 
here 1" 
No, no, no, etc. 
The play at last was over, so I 
started for my home, 
Determined never more to go to matinees alone ; 
I 
pass'd the gents' saloon again, they all were standing there, 
I 
also saw the man that sat beside me in the chair; 
But just as they got sight of me one said, " Boys, aint you dry ?" 
" 
Of course we are," they all replied, and " tumbled to their rye." 
Now, ladies, if you ever should be plagued as I 
have been, 
Just say, " Not if I 
know it," to the naughty, naughty, men. 
No, no, no, etc.

In dreamland, oh, that happy clime; 
His smile it was a

I 
saw his face, his dear sweet face. 
In dreamland, oh, that happy clime; 
He spoke to me of love, he smiled, 
And all seemed like the olden time. 
With outstretched arms he call'd me near, 
That he might give the love- warm kiss 
To me, he used to call most dear, 
The only object of his bliss; 
And as I 
started to receive 
The gifts of love so long ago, 
I 
then awoke to sorely grieve

So, mother, your darling must die. 
The angels are calling me, mother, 
Just look at the.heavens above, 
The gates they are open, and Bertha 
Is joining in praises of love; 
Oh see, she is beckoning, to me 
To come and abide with her there, 
Oh, mother, she's smith'', so sweetly, 
And looking so charming and fair. 
Hark, mother, etc. 
The angels are calling me, mother, 
Oh, listen and hear what they say, 
They tell me to haste to that Eden 
And not for a 
moment delay; 
So, mother, good bye, kiss your darling, 
For Bertha so charmingly sings 
That I 
must away then to join her, 
An angel with bright golden wings. 
Hark. mother, etc.

Written and Composed by Sant BAGNALL. 
I

Named the right bold ninety-third, 
And his daughter, she would certainly charm ye, 
When right quick march is the word.

She can sing, she can dance, she can canter, 
She can row, she can stow, she can steer; 
She's as wild as the uncaught panther, 
And as gentle and as light as the deer; 
She's a 
merry little laugh like the tinkle 
Of a 
sweet- toned silver bell, 
And a 
pair of wicked eyes with a

As black as the wild gazelle. 
She's a

IN a 
little cot down by the maples, 
Just under the brow of the hill, 
My younger days passed there as sweetly 
As waters flow down the clear rill; 
I 
had all that this wide world afforded, 
I 
loved all that nature had done 
To make so delightful and happy 
That cot by the maples—my home. 
CHORUS. 
My home, my home, that cot by the maples, my home; 
Oh, could I 
once more ' neath its old gable roof 
Seek shelter, and never more roam. 
Even now I 
can see by the maples 
That cot in its beauty arrayed, 
The vines they are clinging aside it, 
And there is the green where I 
play'd ; 
Then the lilies and poppies are blooming, 
The roses look charming and brieht, 
And the valleys and meadows are dotted 
With daisies of golden and white. 
My home, etc. 
Oh, listen to me, ye proud maples, 
That wave o'er the place of my birth, 
Watch over that darling old cottage, 
Protect ev'ry patch of the earth ; 
Tho' the winds and the storms may deface it, 
And time wear its beauty away, 
'Twill ever be fresh in my mem'ry, 
That cot where I 
first saw the day.

W AY down by the willows that bend o'er the brook 
That runs through the meadow so green, 
A 
grave, neat and lonely, is handsomely made, 
And there a 
lone daisy is seen; 
The breezes of summer bow down its meek head 
To kiss the sweet earth where it grows, 
And year after year it blooms there all alone 
O'er the dust of him nobody knows. 
CHORUS. 
The little lone daisy, the sweet watchful daisy, 
The meek little daisy that grows on his grave, 
Would tell us, no doubt, if it knew, faithful beauty, 
The name of the dead one o'er whom it doth wave. 
The songs of the robins at bright early morn 
Are anthems for him ' neath the clay, 
But all their sweet warblings to him are unheard, 
He heeds not their musical lay ; 
When roses are blooming, the honey bee sips 
From daisy, that dear little flow'r, 
The sweetness that it could more readily get 
From many a 
sweet scented bow'r. 
The little, etc. 
Sleep on, peaceful stranger, your grave vill be watched 
By songsters that flit near its side, 
And kind little daisy will bow its meek head 
For somebody's darling that died ; 
Perhaps a 
fond heart has been broken for years 
In some far away foreign land, 
Perhaps even now a 
fond maiden awaits 
in tears, for a 
grasp of that hand.

DOWN beside the crimson meadow, 
Where the gushing stream:et flows, 
There's a 
little bush of roses 
Blooming in their sweet repose. 
'Neath the pretty tinted blossoms, 
Sleeps an angel, once so fair, 
And above is spread a 
mantle 
Of the leaflets, made with care. 
Down beside the crimson meadow, 
Where the gushing streamlet flows,. 
There my darling angel's resting 
In a 
calm and sweet repose. 
Dewdrops glisten on the hillock 
At the early dawn of day, 
Robins gather there and warble 
Now and then a 
merry lay ; 
Bluebells, buttercups and daisies 
In profusion grow around, 
Makina, where my darling's sleeping, 
Cherished and most saintly around. 
Down beside, etc.. 
Morning zephyrs sweetly murmur, 
And the gentle evening breeze 
Makes a 
melody of beauty 
Ring throughout the cypress trees; 
There the whippoorwill at evening 
Echoes forth its usual cry, 
While the little chirping crickets 
Sing a 
doleful lullaby. 
Dow n

Starbeams cast their soft reflection 
All the lonely hours of night, 
shedding on her crave so pretty 
Gems of clearest silver lioht; 
And the gushina little streamlet 
Babbles near the grassy mound,

COME again, sweet days of summer, 
With your blue and cloudless skies, 
Bring to me a 
cherished maiden, 
With her sweet and dreamy eyes; 
In the meadows and the valleys 
We will gayly trip once more,

At the vine- clad cottage door.

Oh, my charming little sweetheart, 
With the soft and dreamy eyes; 
Oh, I 
never shall forget her, 
Fairest maiden 'neath the skies. 
Come again, my pretty songsters, 
Sing your glees for her and I; 
Call us to the shady forests 
Where you perch on twigs so high; 
Cheer us with your harmless twitter, 
Fill our hearts with new delight, 
Let the woodland ring with music 
Till you take your nest at night. 
Oh, my charming, etc. 
Come again, oh, gentle breezes, 
Scented with the new- mown hay, 
Bring the flavor of the clover 
From the fields and pastures gay 
Waft the echo of the mowers 
Singing far across the lea. 
And remind my little sweetheart 
She must ever think of me.

W HEN I 
was " broke and busted," and pinched for meat and 
bread, 
I 
joined a 
little party to " work them up ahead ;" 
That is, I 
was the agent, and the agent's business is 
To " fix thines" true and trusty for a 
good and healthy " biz ;" 
I " wrestled programmes" in the town, and helped to stick the 
bills, 
I " button- holed the locals,' and I 
advertised the mills; 
I 
got long " puffs " of eighty lines in papers that were read, 
I 
tell you it's a 
bully job to work the show ahead. 
CHORUS. 
Working ahead, workine. ahead; I 
tell you it's a 
bully job, 
When you are pinched for bread, 
To let yourself as agent and work the show ahead. 
I 
figured close on contracts for baggage, board and halls, 
And on the correspondents I 
made short and friendly calls ; 
I 
gave my " comps " to railroad men including eneineer, 
And didn't change a 
date unless the town was " very queer," 
1 
travelled some on beauty, and a 
lot of pretty girls 
I 
often " mashed " completely with my glossy raven curls, 
They all would make me dine with them, for I 
was easy led, 
Oh, it is just a 
bully job to work the show ahead. 
Working ahead, etc. 
I 
always wore a 
diamond pin when out upon the road, 
And when I 
could get trusted I 
would dress up a 
la mode; 
I 
used to think it gave the show a 
cultivated tone 
To have the agent looking nice, if clothes were Pot his own ; 
Oh I 
was just the " boss " of all the boys within the land, 
And if a 
brother " struck a

ONE day while walking down Broadway 
I 
met my cousin Joe, 
lie asked me then if I 
with him 
To Central Park would go; 
With my consent we then did start, 
And reached the lake at three, 
We took a

Were pass'd by Joe and me. 
CHORUS. 
Sailing on the lake, 
To the music of the birds, 
The rippling of the waters, 
And the sound of loving words. (
Repeat.) 
On our return we took a 
stroll, 
And soon did reach the mall, 
When from the distance music sweet 
Upon our ears did fall ; 
We sat and listened to the hand 
Beneath a 
hawthorn tree, 
While gentle breezes carried words 
Of love from Joe to me. 
Sailing on the lake, etc. 
Now Joe has asked me to be his, 
Of course I 
won't refuse, 
And pa has given his consent— 
This chance I 
must not lose ; 
And when some day at Central Park 
The lale you go to see. 
I 
know you'll \vhisper words of love, 
Like my dear Joe and me.

HE DOETH ALL THINGS WELL. 
I 
REMEMBER how I 
loved her, when, a 
little guileless child, 
I 
saw her in the cradle, as she looked on me and smiled; 
My cup of happiness was full—my joy words cannot tell, 
And I 
blessed the glorious Giver, who " doeth all things well." 
Months passed—that bud of promise was unfolding every hour; 
I 
thought that earth had never smiled upon a 
fairer flower ; 
So beautiful it well might grace the bowers where angels dwell, 
And waft its fragrance to His throne, who " doeth all things 
well." 
Years fled—that little sister then was dear as life to me, 
And woke in my unconscious heart a 
wild idolatry ; 
I 
worshipped at an earthly shrine, lured by some magic spell, 
Forgetful of the praise of him, who " doeth all things well." 
She was the lovely star whose light around my pathway shone, 
Amid this darksome vale of tears, through which I 
journey on; 
Its radiance had obscured the light which round his throne 
doth dwell; 
And I 
wandered far away from him, who " doeth all things 
well." 
The star went down in beauty, yet it stnileth sweetly now 
In the bright and dazzling coronet that decks the Saviour's 
brow; 
She bowed to the Destroyer, whose shafts none may repel, 
But we know, for God hath told us " He doeth all things well." 
I 
remember well my sorrow, as I 
stood beside her bed, 
And my deep and heartfelt anguish when they told me she was 
dead; 
And 0, that cup of bitterness ! let not my heart rebel ! 
God gave, He took, He will restore, " He doeth all things well." 
60 
WE HAVE BEEN FRIENDS. 
W E 
have been friends together, 
It cannot all be o'er; 
The flowers of love that decked our path, 
Oh ! shall they bloom no more 7 
'Tis sad to live ' mid ruined hopes 
That weigh upon the heart ; 
We have been friends together, 
Oh! why should we now part ? 
Oh! why should we now part? 
We have been friends together, 
When seated side by side, 
In the dear home of our childhood, 
Our parents' joy and pride. 
When hearts, that once beat warm and true, 
Were bowed with grief and pain, 
We have been friends together, 
Can we not be again 
Can we not be again'? 
We have been friends together, 
In summer's softest hours, 
In winter's dark and dreary gloom, 
In spring- time ' mid the flowers; 
When autumn leaves were round thee east, 
And sadness () loomed thy brow, 
We have been friends together, 
Oh ! what should part us now 1 
Oh ! what should part us now? 
COME, 
REST IN THIS BOSOM. 
COME, rest in this bosom, my own stricken deer; 
Though the herd have fled from thee, thy home is still here; 
Here still is the smile that no cloud can o'ercast, 
And a 
heart and a 
hand all thy own to the last. 
Oh ! what was love made for, if ' tis not the same 
Through joy and through torment, through glory and shame ? 
I 
know not, I 
ask not, if guilt's in that heart— 
I 
but know that i 
love thee, whatever thou art! 
Thou bast called me thy angel in moments of bliss, 
And thy angel r11 be ' mid the horrors of this; 
Through the furnace, unshrinking, thy steps to pursue, 
And shield thee, and save thee, or perish there too.
