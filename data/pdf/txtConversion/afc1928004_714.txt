Pm thinking of de day a-coining on; 
Oh, come along, my churub, give your Pop a 
kiss, 
Bless the day that he was born

Hello! Bab-by-, here's your Daddy ! 
Up and down he goes! 
You black pie-a-ninny from Old Virginny, 
Goodness, how she grows! 
Black pie-a- ninny from Old Virginny, 
Goodness, how she grows! 
Buy a

Let him swallow good fresh air; 
Feed him on bananas, neber have de gout, 
Yellow ribbon in his hidr; 
Jonah is his namesake, living in de whale, 
A floating noun' de ocean in a 
storm; 
Oh, shouting, happy neighbors, hail-a, hail-a, bail, 
Bless the day that he was born. 
Hello! Baby, etc. 
Buy him little slippers, cover up his toes, 
Keep him from de frost and cold; 
Sit him by the hot fire, don't you freeze his nose, 
Only twenty-two months old; 
Bring him up a 
Baptist, make him go to church, 
Oh, rare him like a 
Possom on a

Oh,give him plenty gum drops,better than the birch, 
Bless the day that he was born.

I 
brought in every neighbor, but with rage 1 
did go wild ; 
I 
found the room was flooded, every dancer lie had fled, 
From the bursting of the Croton by that family overhead. 
There's Rosy and Josy, etc. 
Oh, Norah plays the banjo, and young Cora plays the flute, 
While Rosy plays toe conceruine. it's one perpetual toot; 
Cornelius plays the clarionet until his nose is red. 
Whet, the empty cradle warbled by that family overhead. 
There's Rosy and Josy, . etc. 
Oh. Norah has a 
parrot. and sweet Josy has a 
cat, 
And Katy has canary birds, Cornelius has a

When passing through the hallway, oh, I

I'm dealing out the sherry and the brandy; 
With juicy, spicy whisky punch, a

Airy, gracefully, and handy. 
I'm rolling out the gin, the money's rolling in, 
From boatmen and the pilots of the ferries,

Oh, coMO and hurry, quick, and get a

Soda, sweetaer-kase and schooners.

-THE BLACKBIRD. 
As * ung by EDWAIID HARRIGAN in the Great Irish Drama, entitled 
" 
THE BLACKBIRD." 
'Twas on one summer's morning 
For soft recreation, 
I 
heard a 
beauteous maiden 
A-making a 
sad moan. 
My thoughts they did deceive me, 
Reflection did grieve me, 
And I 
am overburden'd 
With sad, sad misery. 
But if death should ever blind me, 
As true love now inclines me, 
My blackbird I'll seek out, 
Wherever he may be. 
Once on a 
time in England 
My blackbird did flourish; 
He was the bonniest flower 
That e'er in it did spring. 
But oh, that cruel fortune 
Has proven so uncertain. 
That caused the hittet pa rting 
Bet ween both you ano we. 
His blessed name I 
will advanct 
In Spain, Portugal or France, 
And seek out my blackbird 
Wherever he may be. 
I'm sobbing and sighing 
With eqfd 
A H 
oecaw-e my black bird 
Most royal he has flown. 
It. is not the wildest ocean 
Ca n 
frighten me with danger, 
A 
It hough life is a 
pilgrim, 
I 
wander all forlorn. 
But ye'll find more friendshIp 
From them that is a 
stranger, 
My blessings on my blackbird 
Wherever he has goes.

JOHN COPE, OR THE BATTLE OF PRESTON. 
AS sung in the Great Irish Drama, entitled " THE ELACKBiRD.* 
The blair in trumpet sounded far, 
And horsemen rode weel graithed for war, 
While Sir ;John Cope marched fra Dunbar 
Upon a 
misty morning. 
Prince Charlie wi' his Highland host. 
Lay Westward on the Lothian coast; 
But Johnnie,bragged wi' mony.a boast 
He'd rout them ere neist morning! 
Lang ere the cock proclaimed it day, 
The Princes men stood in array, 
And, though impatient for the (ray, 
Bent loW the knee that morning, 
When row-dow roll'd the English drum, 
The Highland bagpipe gied a 
bum, 
And told, the mountain clans had come, 
Grin, death and danger scorning. 
Ilk hand was firm—ilk heart was true; 
A 
shot! and down their guns they threw; 
Then forth their dree claymores they drew. 
Upon that fearfu' morning. 
The English raised a 
loud buzz& 
But durstna bide the brunt ava: 
Tifey wavered—turned—syne ran awa'; 
Like sheep at shepherd's warning. 
Fast— fast their foot a 
sal horsemen flew, 
And caps were mixed wi' bonnets blue. 
And dirks were wet— but no wi' dew 
Upon that dreadfu' morning. 
Few sta,y'd, save no devoted band— 
To bide the blow frae Highland brand, 
That swept around—and heart and hand 
Lopp'd, on that Windy morning. 
What sad mishaps that few befell! 
When faint bad grown the battle's yell 
Still Gardiner fought—and fighting fell, 
Upon that awesome morning. 
Nae braggart—but a 
sodger he. . 
Wha' scot-led wi coward loons to flee; 
San fell aneath the wuld-thorn tree, 
Upon that fatal morning!
