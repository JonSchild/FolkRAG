Bill:  how/we choose performers for a festival such as we have -- are we reviving
 
dying customs or encouraging living customs and promulgating new aspects of them?
 
The Festival never made it exactly clear what the musical purpose of the festival was.
 
This came up in a context of why we were discouraging electronic music at the
 
Festival.  Bill thinks that from a strictly musicological point of view rock and
 
electronic music is a by now a part of everyone's heritage. & e feels that it's okay
 
for us to support an acoustical pre-industrial musical style�we should say that clearly.
 
If on the other a hand we are intending to represent American xxxim musical tradition
 
today
 across the board, we should have had more electrified music than we had.
 
If we choose not to represent a tradition, that's okay, but we shouldn't allow people
 
to think that it's non-traditional (
s�nce we don't have it).
 
Occasionally people would ask from the m�x  crowd why are you not including electrified
 
music; why don't you have western swing?
 
The interaction of professional groups and strict traditional artists was discussed.
 
Frank commented part of the prcb}em was in schdduling the Boys of the Lough who never
 
got to sing more than two songs at a t
ime and were frustrated and angry; the De Dannon
 
group had half an hour programs during Irish week and^felt good wo so they integrated
 
better with the older traditionalists.  In general the feeling was that professional
 
groups and traditionalists can be presented at the same t
ime if they are handled
 
properly
 
The Diaspora part of the festival both in terms of field work and presentation
 
though it should have been the best a part of the festival was, Bill thinks, the
 
weakest.  Their field work in the :
west indes was pitiful, and their presentations
 
-
on the festival stage were more directed towards the slick pop show style rather
 
than trying to convey some data which might have been useful to the audience in
 
finding out what the music was about.  A person who should have been allowed to presetn
 
more often was the Belgian guy with Zaire; Halim was a victim of that pop format
,.
 
The goal of their presenters was to be a showmen.  James Early often made Jesse
 
Jackson st ye impassioned speeches which was okay but they didn't explain e anything
 
about the music to the people.  Bill Wiggins tried to say something substantive about
 
the music but he didn't know anything much really.  They did find sane very finde
 
performers but they also had sane :
,
: poor ones like the Zydeco band and two of their
 
blues bands . Also presenting avant garde experimental electronic music as they did
 
at the last confuses the issue very much; it was jazz rather than any relationship to
 
folk.
 
We really shied away from m saying things that might be cultural judgments, since they
 
are so easy to misunderstand.  Bill thinks �
 anyone doing anything like his
 
job in future should be brought on several months ahead of time in order to build up
 
his awn knowledge and information in order to make coherent statements.  Bess suggested
 
a cantometric run-through for a cultural style picture for each arPA from which
 
generalized comments could be made.
 
I
- Where Bill had had direct experience
 
and time to research he was on pretty sure territory but where he hadn't he had to
 
depend on field workers notes which were sometimes not very informative.  Susan sug-
gested that in future we should require of field workers that they prepare an over-
view statement making cultural statements and sketching in the historical and
 
cultural background
 -
 their field reports.
 
Frank:  there was never any clearly enunciated purpose for the main stage; opinions
 
ranged from Ralph's view that it relieved crowding to B
.C.'s notion that it was
 
where we should and could put our porofessional foot forward.  Physically it was
 
hostile to most of what the rest of the festival was about; it was a performance
 
context that was removed from anything we were trying to present -- traditional
 
people didn;t work that well in that context.  The Rumanian group was designed for
 
main stage presentation but everywhere else, where we were trying to present people
 
in something like paz
-fox=
Em=exo mkexk natural performance context, people were
 
frightened of performing there.  It was too high; it was too formal.  It was perfect
 
for blues bands and professional bluegrass but not for most of the folks.
 
Fifty-five thousand dollars was budgeted for sound there and 1
0,000 for construction
 
but nothing for presentation or programming until the last minute when we shifted
 
things around in order to get Bill and Al on.  This is pretty characteristic, Frank
 
thinks, of the confused attitude towards what the main stage was for anyway.
 
The rationale for the main stage was unclear and also poorly communicated to the
 
program areas.  In Old Ways, Shirley was working against Susan in trying to get coopera
-
tion for the main stage, so the field workers were picking up one message from Shirley
 
and another from Susan.  There were a lot of the field workers who understood the
 
cross-cultural idea immddiately P
ut a lot that never did.  Tom suggested that perhaps
 
the ethnomusicologists who tended to think cross-culturally caught on better, being
 
a bit broader in their perspectives than even the folklorists who often tended to
 
be extremely protective of their fiefdoms
 
Bill:  it seems to him an error to continue a festival based solely in Washington
 
and continue calling it a FAF.  It should be moved around the country from year to year
 
if we are coninuing to put on a national festival, one year in one state, one year
 
in another and so on.
 
We needed more people to go around and check on the well-being of performers; E
.C.
 
-and Orna Ball were put on for too long periods and were too tired and didn't want to
 
catmlain.  Probably there are many such situations we'll never know about.  There
 
should have been more checks and more fall-backs to minimize the damage of the
 
ixs mscitixex occasional insensitive people we hired.
 
The Festival stage programs were often not as strong as they could have been because
 
there was not enough time to work
,
,
 ith the performers before going on stage; we really
 
needed two presenters.  Repertoiren &uld have been selected.  Additional presenters
 
attached to the main stage should have been out on the festival grounds listening to
 
what the next days performers could have been.  Two is simply the minimum.
 
It would have been better if Bill could have gone to the site and listened to the
 
programs as given the first day; the rehearsals were useful, but the programs would
 
have been better.  Rehearsals were useful if they show very briefly what each per-
formance would be about; the least successful rehearsals were the ones that were
 
dcminated by the filming.
 
The musicians registry was marginally helpful from Old Ways when Bill got to see it;
 
Bill McNeill was a big help from Regional; Diaspora people were pzEJdw hostile to the
 
notion that a musicians registry was even being considered and were offended that
 
Bill
 enquired; Native couldn't give Bill anything because they didn't know what
 
was coming.  If the concept had been well done, it would have been a tremendous help.
 
The scheduling procedure that was finally evolved was probably the best that could be
 
worked out; they did it with Diaspora and Regional the Saturday or Sunda
y of  the  week
 
before and`�Wbld Ways at the rehearsal.  Bill says that anybody who was a field worker
 
who didn't feel himself responsible to prepare axfmixly
- in real detail what his
 
performers were about, where they were from, what they did etc. shouddn't have been
 
hired.

multiple roles of our r
-
orticipants- their occupations, region, ethnic heritage,
 
skill or talent.  The main stage might function in this way rather than or in
 
addition to presenting the cross cultural pictitlre.  This might help put to-
gether the shattered image of folklife we present.
 
If we do pursue the crosscultural idea, Susan suggests that we need to plan
 
the Festival with that in mind.  Just another thing to keep in our heads while
 
planning schedules.
 
Bill pointed out that for main stage the French week, esp. the Cajuns, worked
 
best for making the cross cultural point.  The Cajuns plus the U
.S .
 French
 
Canadians., and the Cajuns from Regional, Old Ways  and African Diaspora.
 
Again the question comes up, why did this week work so well?  Even better than
 
the Hispanic week where we really concentrated our energies to produce a cross-
cultural statement? Bess told how the Cajuns ado]ed the Regional stage with a
 
dance floor as their meeting ground and came from all over the Festival to
 
gather there.  It was, in her words, the way Regional ought to have operated..
 
&
:
'K  P

In general, the two sessions,k inted up our need to rethmnk the main stage
 
rationale and work out its effectiveness.
 
One suggestion was that perhaps we do evening concerts and even cross-cultural
 
things on area stages.  We could thus eliminate main stage (
Bill suggested that
 
in a way, it violates what all the other areas are about).  Or we could have a
 
main stage area, less elaborate, maybe with a dance floor,,,for big bashes and
 
programs when crowds were heavy, etc.
 1­X_
 
To explicate further, why could not Working Americans demonstrate their additional
 
traditional skills (
a fiddle playEming railroad engineer, a farmer-sculptor)?  There
 
really is no place in the entire festival where multiple roles are explored --
occupational, regional, ethnic, religious.

 (
Barbara and Bill, Mike
 
Ton Adler.  Week 2
.  A pleasant guy, didn't do terribly coiiplete field
 
reports and recommended a mixed bag of people including the lady who
 
learned to weave cornshucks from watching an exhibit at Williamsburg
 
(
we found out after she got here, totally inappropriate.)  and the
 
Mayfields, a singing family from Illinois that Mike wouldn't re-invite
 
Bill said he claimed he never got clear instructions from in-house staff.
 
Barbara and the group generally feel that would not re-invite him to
 
do field work for another festival.  He was one of the guys we hired when
 
we realized we had same holes in week 2 and Rusty Marshall couldn't
 
go in and do the work, so Rusty and Bob Byington recomm
ended him and Barbara
 
only spoke to him on the phone, so m perhaps his complaint was justified
 
(
n
o real guidance)
 
He is a graduate student at Indiana but has not worked on Ohio festival
 
according to T
im.  In conversation, Barbara said he seemed to know the turg
 
well, knew the people Ralph and T
im had suggested looking up but this was
 
not reflected in the field work w he turned into us.  Could have been a
 
question of time, or money or a poor explanation on Barb's part.  Bill
 
thought he really didn't understand what the festival was about and not
 
therefore being sure how to go about doing what he had onyl a very few
 
days to do.  He might, in summary, be a good person to be in touch with
 
if you needed to know something about that area in a hurry, but not the
 
most clearly focussed field worker possible.  Nick potinted out that what
 
he understood about the festival over the phone last summer was quite
 
P RtH
 different from the festival when he got to sce it.
 
ZxEH 
z Bess pointed out that this list will be totally out of date
 
in a matter of a year or so and should then be thrown out.
 
Peter Fagley.  Did work in New England, week 1
.  He was hired to do music
 
and Bill would not recommend him again.  Bill said he doesn't know his
 
stuff, maybe there is not anybody else up there that does either; he went
 
for revival types, a lot of the people he turned in were Greenwich Village
 
types.who  If anybody wants to know about contra dancing, however, he does
 
seem to know that backwards and forwards (
Barbara); Bill qualified that
 
to say if you want to know about contra dancing in New Hampshire he might
 
be the one.  Bill says he is s
imply not well versed in what we are looking
 
for; he was a free lance photographer with no training in folklore or
 
anthro -- Bill said somebody that Rayna knew. Bill said he has put on some
 
small scale festivals in New Hampshire.
 
Barbara said we should be looking for people's strengths as well as their
 
weaknesses, so that this list could have wider use than perhaps just
 
festival related skills.

a w Lutz.  Tim said he and Doug Radcliffe were hired originally to do
 
Ohio and collectively they spent zero days doing fieldwork in Ohio.  They
 
were sent to areas where they had never been - Mar g
in to New York state
 
and Kansas and Douglas to Illinois, Kansas and Nebraska.  Rixxdid They
 
worked for the Ohio festival the several years it was held; the first year
 
they were sound technicians and were very good (
assigned by the state fair)
 
and it turned out they knew folklore in southern part of the state pretty well
 
1

Zne second and third years they were field workers, concentrating on the south
 
of the axxx state; they know a fair a
nount about music and material culture of
 
that area including cognates in West Virginia and Kentucky.  Most of the people
 
they worked with had come to Chio from there.  Bill said they were kind of like
 
Jens; they turned in a lot of R stuff a lot of which was inappropriate.  I
le
 
assumed they could tell the difference.  Bess said she thought some people got
 
mixed directions on whether to turn in everything they came across good, bad or
 
indifferent; some people turned in just what they recommended and some the whole
 
shot.  Bill thinks they did the latter  though some of the things they recommended
 
we vetoed.
 
Steve Poyser.  Material culture in Kentucky.  Barbara doesn't know him.  He had
 
previously done f
ield work out of personal interest ixzwesturmzKeatx¢ky and has
 
a masters degree xm from Western Kentucky. Bill says he knows that field and area
 
fairly well.  Comes from Kentucky.
 
Ed Miller.
 (
Bill says no.)  Bazhoxaxsa±d  Later added his material culture was
 
all right — his music was awful.  Barbara said he recommended Gary Dunshee and
 
Rex Ivey and they were very good.  Bill said apparently he didn't know haw to
 
use a tape recorder, because you could hardly hear the music he turned in.  He
 
would sit in down on a table sounded like in a bar so you picked up the table
 
reverbs and the conversation and the music going on way in the background. The
 
tapes were almost useless to listen do.  He is Scottish in background and is now
 
in Scotland doing field work so one would assume he knows something about something
 
but maybe it's just material culture.
 (
It was really impossible to tell if his
 
music would have been any good if you could have heard it, so a judgment there is
 
difficult to make.) He was a coffee house performer.  Most of his recommendations
 
were seconded to Bess by Nick Spitzer;  Bess doesn't know haw much Nick knows --
she thinks both had the attitude that it was the normal range of material that we
 
wanted, that if most bands in an area were elctrified, for example, that we were
 
obliged to represent the area in terms of electrified instruments.  Bess thinks
 
that was the baseline that various field workers were working from and that it
 
was an issue that never quite got unscrambled with all the changeover of directions
 
in Regional -- whether we were going for the typical or the old or the special or
 
what.  General*y it turned out to be a mix of everything; at least Ed Miller was
 
deliberately trying to go for the average of what you would hear in that region
 
as we was Nick Spitzer.  Bill said that in talking to him, his idea was to show
 
how eclectic mmds
< folk musicians are which Bill isn't sure is what the festival is
 
out to show.  Bess thought that Jim Griffiths was similarly interested in and
 
intrmgued by the eclecticism they found -- its a respectable position; you have
 
to know though what people's line is.  This perspective has not been the one taken
 
by this festival -- however, there could well be others where this PH would be
 
useful.  Texas seems to be very big on that k
i=Rxoi kind of things, Diana said,
 
not just in folk music but with the seven flags kind of thing and what influenced
 
the various directions culture has taken there etc.  It may thus be an emphasis
 
throughout the whole state, though also this is a position promoted by UT folklorist
 
as well.
 
Dudley Radcliffe.  His orientation is more musical than Mark's; both of them went
 
to Ohio State, studied with Utley et al.  Barb asked Tim if their notion of
 
traditional music is more varied than hers, and Tim said yes. He said they were
 
interested in revival musicians personally, though not for a festival; however,
 
they would clearly support such groups as the Etc. String Band who were reviving
 
a tradition indigenous to their region.
 
Ken Stewart.  Bill said he knew him and would not recommend him.  "He knows material
 
culture stuff in the Xx Dakotas
 but he's clearly unrel(�ahle.  He did his field work
 
I
I
 
for the 1975 Festival but turned it in so later that it couldn't be used until
 
1
976 -- actually, Navember of 1
976.
 
Dianne Macallom.  Barbara doesn;t know her.  Tim said he and Charley (
?) went
 
up to talk her.  She had never done festival field work before, came very highly
 
recommended by Bob Teskie and Jack Witowski (
?) from Wayne State where she went.
 
She had done academic field work and some teaching assistant there.  She knows
 
Detroit like the back of her hand - has lived there all her life.  She was
 
extremely unfamiliar with what this festival was about, but caught on pretty soon.
 
She was the person who located the Williamsons. Her field work in terms of
 
anount was rather small because by the time she got her money she was already
 
starting graduate school - Most of what she turned in was music; the Williamsons
 
were the only people she found who were actually invited; she turned in a lot of
 
revival material but seems to know the difference.  She now has had some festival
 
work experience and Tim feels would be worthwile to work with again.  Bill doesn't
 
think you could send her just anywhere, that she would be better in Michigan,
 
specifically Detroit.  She has worked in the Wayne archives a lot, so she would
 
be good to contact for info about what is in the archives.
 
Rusty Marshall.
 (
FV
irbara didnt' know.)  Bill: I
'm not that impressed with the
 
stuff he's done. Barbara said she was totally unimpressed with the music he sent
 
in -- all sort of a jumble with no distinction between traditional carriers and
 
revival; we didn't invite any of the musicians he reccmTended -- the only thing
 
we went with was the mule business.  Tim said the problems with that were that he
 
talked with a guy at the state fair show and it got confused afterwards as to just
 
who kH he had talked to -- the guy gH he wanted to get has since died and his
 
brother came and everything got balled up because it was not clearly indicated
 
that he had not talked to the people for whom he turned in the cards.  Bill: his
 
comments were more cute than really informative.  He worked in Missouri.  Barbara:
 
Ralph and Bob have a very different opinion of Rusty; Bill said we didn't actually
 
hire him originally - Bob came in one day and said he had.and Tim talked with
 
Rusty one day he did seem to know a good deal about the people in southern Missouri
 
especially the mule shows.  His product however felt short of what we were led to
 
expect.  Barba said that he was really busy - that's why we had to hire Tan Adler
 
to work in that area.  Bill said that another thing is that he has a very abrasive
 
personality and that he's difficulty to get along with him until you get to know
 
him.  Bess suggested that he may have been adjusted to the earlier more casual
 
festival style (
before 1974) that this last year was the first year things got into
 
sane degree of general order - up till then it was pretty individualistic and
 
people didn't have to write reports and all that and he may just not have gotten
 
on to the new style.
 
Elliott Wiggington (
Was working with the Foxfire people for us.)  He phased in and
 
out. He has actually not sent in an invoice; Diana has talked to him a couple of
 
times and he feels very badly about taking any money from us at all and probably
 
will not.  He did recommend some people to Alan Tulles but actually he -
t-. didn't
 
have time to do anything for the Festival but was just going to do the building
 
because that was a good project for Foxfire students.  Bill said Wig is good on
 
crafts but knows very little about music.  Tim said one of the reasons the building
 
project didn't come through was lack of time on WU Wigginton's part; he was also
 
sick -- the foreman was ill also and they had a lot of projects they were comm
itted
 
to get ready for the beginning of the school year.
 
Gail Zaninovich.  Gail was recommended by Susie Jones to do Russian Old Believer
 
co m
munity She picked out sane very nice people; she didn't think of than as
 
singers -- she had to be asked to take a tape of them and send it in — so the
 
hunch is she doe nf
txk g
7A
 
knows the community more from a social-anthropological ap aspect than a
 
folkloric.  She was also pregnant at the time and had very little time;
 
she was unable to cane to the Festival for that reason.  She had worked in
 
the community before and didn't seem to have a problem catching on to what
 
we were looking for.  She might or might not be interested in doing things
 
beyond this; she probably would be interested in working for the festival
 
again -- she may be a Russian specialist.  Hhe  wasn't an obstacle -- saying
 
they won't do this or that or they shouldn't do this; she had a good attitude.

Sandy Rikoon did field work this past year and would like to again — $
m
 
Iowa, Oklahoma, Kansas, Missouri — midwest.  Tim also.  Also Bill.
 
Bill says midwest, south and New England are areas where he would feel comfortable
 
working; he's done more field work in New England than anyplace else.
 
Barbara said that a lot of the New RU England material crafts that were sub-
mitted reflected a colonial crafts revival -- Peter sent it in -- If we had
 
had more field workers there we could have gone beyond that level to others;
 
but the colonial revivals were what people hit when they first went out.  WR
 
rFakkyzdidzAtxdo  Munson protested that the level of New England field work
 
was poor -- that in New Hampshire, Maine, Vermont, not so much Conn and Mass
 
so much of the stuff is done exactly the way it's always been done.  The seaboard
 
along there is not revivalist, it's a part of life; Barbara agreed and said
 
she thought we didn't do the seacoast stuff well.  Bess said she thought we
 
blew New RU England generally.  We didn't have enough field workers out; by the
 
time we caught on to the fact we were in trouble, it was tough to handle it only
 
by phone.  Bob mentioned two of the big things that go on in New England are
 
trapping and taxidermy; pretty tough to represent at the festival.
 
Barbara said we worried early on about whether or not we were to attempt to
 
have some representation from every state; Jim's position was that we were not
 
obligated to pick a person from each state.  In New England we really did Penn-
sylvania and Maine exclusively.
 
Karen Baldwin.  Did the recitation stuff.  Worked very well in the festival --
did her dissertation on the recitation in New England or so r
e such; has had these
 
folks in the classroom.  She recomlended the people to Peggy (
she was me of
 
Peggy's teachers -- she's at Amherst now, went to school at Penn.  She was very
 
pleasant and cooperative to work with at the Festival during week one.
 
Jack Bennett (A  Barb:
 "He was a nice person who was trying to do a strange
 
job well; he had no area of expertise that pertziined to what he was doing.  If
 
you were doing a festival again and you had another nice person around who was
 
cooperative and willing, that other person would do just as well."  Nick:  "I
 
saw him put a couple of performers on the spot once or twice; he had a tendency
 
to say, "Why don't you tell us about that' and hand over the mike, but he seemed
 
willing to learn and willing to try."  Barb:  He was hired because I had asked
 
area coordinators to recommend people as t
.l.c.ers and presenters that they could
 
work comfortably with.
 (
The implication was that he had been hired as t.l.c.)
 
Joyce Bynum:  Tim:  Joyce worked very well this year; I wpa was very impressed
 
with her -- beter than last year.  Diana;
 "from the participant
 
coordination end of things and from the administrative end, she was kind of a
 
pain to work with; bmtxi;xmmzkha the administrative and programmatic areas seem
 
to be entirely different.
.- e.g. Diana said that she got on fine with Susie Jones.
 
F
aa m the standpoint of a staff person who has to get certain information etc. from
 
a field worker seems to have no bearing on whether or not the person makes a
 
good presenter.
 
Barbara said however that if a person is a pill and makes difficulties until they
 
get on the stage, it just isn't worth having them around regardless of how expert
 
they are in presentation.  Beverly apparently had the same kind of problem with Joyce
 
as RRz Diana did.
 
(
Background on Joyce from Bess:  She came to present the Assyrians in 1
975 f
bM as
 
part of the California presentation.  Several staff people heard her quarreling in
 
what must have been a very unprofessional way with them and Rayna got to the point
 
of wanting to send her home.  Bess opposed this on the grounds that nobody else could
 
get along with the Assyrians either — they were just like the Lebanese -- and that
 
Joyce was under terrific strain, both physical and psychological, since she had just
 
had a mastectomy two weeks before the festival and probably should not have come.
 
Bess had advised her to stay hone but did not insist since Joyce had done an enormous
 
amount of California field work and was looking forward to the experience very much.)
 
General agreement among the folkloric staff (
Mike, Barb, Nick, Tim) was that she
 
handled herself much better this summer especially with the folks but clearly the
 
administrative staff m m found her sonewhat acerbic.  Mike suggested that she was
 
one of those people who felt terrific concern that every one of the folks got just
 
what they needed and that possibly it came out as ani
 overly demanding attitude
 
on her a part.  Barb:  "Joyce is a hard worker who will do not only what you ask her
 
field wise but she'll generate a whole lot of her own ideas; her big drawback is that
 
she doesn't differentiate with consistency what is revival and what is traditional."
 
Barb would not hesitate to hire her again.  Bill commented that she was a kind of field
 
worker like Jens — she turns up a lot of stuff.  Nick added that this was true not
 
just in the field but as a presenter, she was willing to tackle anything; she's not
 
afraid of anything and that's very handy.  Barb — she also was able to say that someone
 
was a nice person and that person would turn out to be nice.  Bess:  in her California
 
work she turned in a tape of an Assyrian lady who was singing in a very mpeRatzx
 
operatic semi-professional style and we told her she was unsuitable and she had the
 
hutzpa to go back and tell the lady she wished she would sing like the lady ordinarily
 
did at hone.  So the lady sang like she ordinarily did at home, and Joyce said that's i
t
 
Most people don't do that; they will not tell a performer any other d
imension of
 
performance than the one they first getTxfhdszisxs
 Bill
 
commented that most people are both afraid to do that and don't have the time to
 
work on that level; when they are on the road, they can't go back.  Tim (
I think)
 
said he had found her flexible in programming.  Diana said she was inflexible in
 
business arrangements and tended to be brusquer and tempery in financial arrangments;
 
Barbara commented that she was surprised to hear that Beverly had had problems with
 
her too.
 
Ed Cabell.  Bill: I was not totally impressed with him.  Barb:  He was at first de-
fensive, making sure that we were going to treat the black people we were inviting
 
properly.  Beverly had an interesting telephone conversation with him before he knew
 
that she was black in which he told her what black folklore was about and what he
 
expected his treatment would be; then he talked to Alan Tullos and called back with
 
a completely changed tone (
Bev had been carrying him onyx and he had told her that
 
you white folks just don't understand where we're coning from.)  Mike:  He seemed to
 
have a decent background in what he was dealing in but he was very shy in presenting
 
and not willing to insert himself into a workshop or presentation in a way that could
 
guide or focus attention; he kind of laid back and seemed uncomfortable with the whole
 
idea of presenting.  Diana:  he was on the defensive and this comes out in all kinds of
 
ways.  Barb:  He was uncomfortable in presenting things he didn't know anything about
 
and when he presented things he d was familiar with he had a tendency �
pm to let it
 
just flow; his position was that people should pick out what was important rather than
 
telling them what to look for.  Bess:  This represents a definite philosophic dis-
agreement and some people are aware that they are taking that position and have a
 
lot of rationale behind it, and some people just do it because that's just their
 
personal style to let things go along in a serendipitous sort of way.

nportant to Mid out what a pres(i-i
ter's attitude
 
is on t
hat (
luestion.  If they have a very strong r
x)sition one way or the other,
 
its awfully difficult for them to take the opposite point of view.  I have a strong
 
position the other way and as a result it's very hard for me to lay back in presen-
tational terms, though it's easy for me to in interviewing.  I sometimes just psych
 
myself into saying well I
'm just going to interview this guy and let him ramble.
 
Bill:  Ed's a kind of a quiet person anyway; he was a lot better than(Sparky?)
 
Barbara: he felt that his job here was to take care of the black folks that we had
 
invited; he didn't show up to the second presenters meeting to find out the plans
 
and changes we were making and when I had a little run in with him the next day I
 
told him I thought one of the best waysto take care of the folks was to be a part
 
of the decision making.  He clearly was only interested in the folks that came from
 
West Virginia, again protecting them from whatever hard or oversights we might
 
inflict on them.  Bill contented that he had a lot of information about those folks
 
but that he didn't usually give it when he got up on stage; "I just got the impression
 
that he was a kind of a quiet person who didn't like to talk a lot." Mike:  I talked
 
to him frequently about the John Henry Foundation and he was very verbose when it came
 
to the role of black culture in the mountains etc. and twice I said, I
'm glad you told
 
me all this and I hope you can incorporate this information into your presentations
 
and he didn't really respond.
 
Barb:  He was very glad to have the folks we had presented in Regional rather than
 
Diaspora; and that says something positive about where he was corning from.  He
 
appreciated having them presented within a geographic cultural frame as well as
 
being Afro-Americans.  Bess:  he was a nice guy to have around; he seemed to get on
 
well with whites as well as blacks.  Barb:  he was willing to try things that he was
 
not familiar with - he presented the Christian Harmony folks because he was interested
 
in hearing them.  However, he was bored by the music and instead of saying so and
 
that he wanted to change he sort of didn't show up or pay much attention.
 
Guy Carawan.  Mike:  he did an excellent job with the presentation of his folks;
 
that's all I saw of him. It was more or less like his record; he felt a bit bad about
 
their being presented solely as miners, however, he wanted to give a little more
 
contextual information about life in West Virginia which Mike felt was also an
 
important point to bring out.  Barb:  Guy is good at getting people involved in and
 
sensitized to what music is about; he's too much so in that x everything sort of turns
 
into a happening or a love-in and so you sort of go with it.  Tim:  he was good in
 
what he did but he didn't do much with anything else, didn't go to the regional learnin, 
center or anything like that.  Mike:  He limited himself in what he did.
 
Dennis Coelho.  Bess:  I only heaxrd him on the main stage and I thought he was ex-
ceptionally good; he got a lot of zxz =atimazixk0xa information into very brief
 
introductory statements and it was useful information, pertinent.  Barb:  he was
 
Mokhmcx another one of those people who weren't afraid to tackle things he didn't
 
know anything about; he did the Basque workshop which could really have been a
 
disaster with three little people talking a whole hour about Basques in Idaho and
 
California.  He did an exceptionally good job on that; he had information that he
 
managed to slip in.  Mike:  He was totally plugged in to what we wanted to do with
 
the Festival.  He didn't hesitate either in week 6
 when we had a young gal who had
 
a drinking problem and who was making a fool of herself, not showing up at performances
 
etc. and he went and talked with her, didn't shy away from that sort of problem.
 
Bess: what about his field work?  Barb:  he had a sort of screwy setup as far as I
 
can determine.  He waR did Idaho and was then hired for a very few days to do Washingto
i
 
and he said he couldn't do it in that time and got 1
0 more days... Bill:  there was
 
a conflict between him and Susie because she thought he was going to do a lot of
 
ethnic communities in Washington and he didn't.  Bess:  I seem to recall Rayna didn't
 
approve of his field work.  Bill:  She didn't like him was what it was.  Diana:
 
She didn't like his field work either, she had a long phone call when she told him
 
:
i
 
to stop sending in that corny stuff.  Bill:  She l
iked some of his stuff; she liked
 
Roberta Whiting (
?) and all those f
iddlers, she just said that we've got too many
 
f
iddlers, and it had no balance.  Diana:  she said ik his work was not representative
 
of the area.  R Barb:  She also said his stuff was hokey and to stop sending in that
 
crap and some of that attitude got transmitted to Susie who then decided that Dennis
 
was on the wrong side of things.  Susie had the impression that he didn't have a good
 
relationship with the people  which certainly didn't come across in his f
ield reports
 
or in the people he brought in during his weeks (
his relationship with them).
 
He's still in school in Indiana, and is program director of the mid-west folk festival.
 
Bill:  The thing was he sent in some songs that a man and his wife learned from the
 
guy's father and RRyaaxsx d we said no and then Rayna said you've got to get some
 
singers and they had a set-to.  Barb:  Some of the confusion comes about when you don't
 
know if someone is sending in everything they collected or only the stuff they were
 
recommending.  But he told me that Rayna said that his stuff was cnmmy and then when
 
I looked it up in the book, most of it was graded 1 (
top grade).  Bill:yuciA she was
 
referring to those singers that had been turned dawn and she wanted a better balance.
 
Barb:  So I think his field work was obviously of acceptable quality.  Mike:  he
 
pitched in quite a bit here, problem solving.  Barb:  he again was like Peggy who
 
accepted the responsibility of being a go-between to explicate rather than to set up
 
barriers between participants and staff.
 
Linda Danielson:  Mike:  Her perspective on folklore has been tainted too much by a
 
limited amount of experience in a small area and she hasn't atteitvted to move out of
 
that area and get an overall perspective of the entire northwest region.  Her judgment
 
in terms of fiddle style is good; she knows those styles she has been exposed to.
 
From the human relations end  I would give her a law grade.  Barb:  I
 would never work
 
with her again, period.  I thought the way she conducted heraffairs in the field with
 
participants was totally destructive to our efforts here.  She is competent in fiddle
 
styles but in mopexakiya
.xapptied the applied cooperative sense, she's a wash-out.
 
Diana:  She would walk up to people she had brought, and right in front of you, she'd
 
say "Well, they've screwed us over again."  9kexwazxa  Barb:  She was a problem in
 
the dormitory too, not explaining to people why they had to stop playing at 11:00,
 
finding pianos for her people to play on.  Mike:  she put in dust instead of oil.
 
Jim Griffith:  Okay.  Good presenter.  Bill:  he has a tendency to like to perform.
 
Mike:  he doesn't like to get involved with presenting per se; he goes in for self-
definition, let the folks define themselves.  Barb:  he's an energetic field worker.
 
Mike:  and when it comes to x
 working out wrinkles he's willing to lend a hand and
 
stay up as late as necessary to handle problems.  Tim (
?) he helped me out a lot when
 
I was in his area in the f
ield. Hizxreportz)czth
 axtitidezxamh ake*zwbazxhazmamaged
 
Bess:  his reports, though a little inchoate, when you managed to figure out which
 
piece of paper he'd written what down on, were remarkably conplete with the information
 
you needed.  Mike:  he's very good at working with people like Van Holyoke, people
 
who hazxmarx have narratives.  Nick:  he's definitely a westerner.  Barb:  he's sensity
,
 
to cultural dif
(Ferences enough not to just blam into something, and I would work with
 
him again as a field worker and as a presenter, but I think he has somewhat the same
 
category as Joyce in that he turns in a lot of stuff  that is not M,
 rr
y :
riate for
 
this festival.  R One of the reasons may be that he is involved in a festival in his
 
own community that is a l
ittle less selective in a lot of the areas that we are selec-
tive in.  He's more plugged into what he's doing there than what we're doing here.
 
I found him totally undefensive though;ahoutxM 4 e
.g. when we talked about why we
 
couldn't fixd have the santero who tattooed saints faces on people he argued a little
 
bit but we didn't get into ideological hassles constantly over every such issue.
 
Bess:  I think he i
s, however, definitely a regionalist; he told me that one of his
 
job problems is that he is unwilling to leave Arizona; he said that's where I
've done
 
all my work aadx1xwiit and that's where I
 want to say.  I
'll go elsewhere in the
 
southwest but not anywhere else.  I think he would not be interested in moving around

the few presenters who had any poetry to him or who appreciated poetry.  I
Ie was
 
one of the few who would sit down and say, "DanTnit there's some good music going

Bess:  another nice thing about h
im was he was a good dancer and he was very good

Susie Jones.  Barb:  I would not work with Susie again where any kind of •
xi- cooperative
 
effort was required between a her and anybody else.  She has a good eye for materiel
 
but not for the people who produce the artifacts and for me ixzJcexmszofx mz-f

work; it doesn't make her a good i
imcd field worker in terms of finding nice people
 
Jm.  Bill:  the problem is that she's in an area where if you don't work with her
 
there's not a whole lot of other people.  Barb:  I think you ask Barry Toelken to
 
ask around.  Diana:  just for the record, I never had any difficulty dealing with her
 
in the kinds of things I had to deal with her about.  Barb:  Charley did in setting
 
up her contract; she m wrote him a rather vitriolic letter which is in the f
iles.
 
Diana:  since we did this in reverse for Joyce, I think it's only fair for me to
 
oomment again when it's this way round.  Mike:  I think the same holds true for Susie
 
as for Linda Danielson -- she's working from a very limited perspective andexposure
 
to a lot of things and that taints her outlook on the entire region.  And anybody
 
with a wider regional perspective is going to have a problem working with her.  Barb:
 
Ixtazmkx I don't think she is a regionalist in the same sense that Allen Tullos and
 
Jim Griffiths are; she's a
 wood-careerist from Oregon. I don't think she has an
 
interest and regional curiosity in terms of all the things going on in the area; I
 
think what we may have taken for regionalism was sort of defensiveness.  Bill:
 
I think she was Barry Toelken's suggestion.  Barb:  I think for a l
imited kind of thing,
 
if someone were interested in wood carvers in the northwest she would be the one to
 
contact, but in applying that to a general production of a festival she's not the
 
person.  Diana°  also Beverly had trouble with her — a
lmost everybody did.  Barb:
 
Poor a
af
fx attitude.  Mike:  Also before the Festival she had planted very bad seeds
 
in the participants so that whe they arrived a lot of them were on the defensive and
 
ready for a fight.  Barb:  It was to the point where when Beverly would talk to someone
 
on the phone about having tried to make this or that arrangement, the person would say
 
"Well, you really are trying to be helpful, aren't you?" xx -- they said said you
 
wouldn't be very helpful cc you'd try to do less than ym I
'd really need or whatever.
 
IH Bill:  I think a lot of that is due to the fact that she was warned last year Hot to
 
make sure that she got a guarantee on that, not to take anything for granted etc.
 
Barb: Many of us had first person experiences last year and if we recapitulated last
 
year's experience none of us would have been able to work together  and accomplished
 
what we did; we wouldn't even have accepted the job.  Nick:  It was the extension of
 
that to the participants that really got to me; I you don't use the participants as
 
weapons the way she did. She would stir them up really to make her point for her; it
 
was really kind of vicious.  T
j = Sandy:  she was very uncommunicative too; she kept
 
iRsimkixgxzozmnx
.bezxomaxwayxthat trying to get her own way behind your back so that
 
there was very little cooperation between her and the grounds crew.  Barb:  she would
 
also ask various people about the same thing until she got the answer she wanted
 
or misconstrue what one person said to the next person to produce the desired effect.
 
And this happened even before Linda Danielson was there, so it was not generated by
 
Linda.
 
David Littleton Taylor.  Knows material culture fairly well, N.E. seacoasts.  Seemed
 
willing to try to present music but wasn't very happy doing it and wasn't particularly
 
well; once we decided to turn him loose on crafts, he seemed a lot more happy and
 
productive.  He was very quiet, held back at the dorms.  Nick:  he took direction
 
pretty well; when he was presenting and got into difficulties, if you gave him a hint,
 
he would go right out and work with it; clearly music wasn't his bailiwick but he was
 
interested in trying.  He is also a regionalist - a Maine man and a seacoast guy,

M
ike:  I think that has to do with the fact that he's put on a lot of fiddle contensts
 
and he's been in radio. Bill:  he's a frustrated country western...  (
Everybody agreed)
 
He wanted to perform very badly and managed to sneak it in a couple of t
imes.  Sandy:
 
he gets along real well with the people from his area.  Mike:  his whole presentation
 
is based on visiting — he says, "We're going to visit with whoever" and he is very
 
informal and I only saw only one presentation that was bekow par.  Nick:  they were
 
a little on the corny side sometimes.  Barb:  he knows the region, he gets along very
 
well with the folks and he would be a good crafts presenter too because he can talk
 
to anyone, he doesn't stand there, he responds with gusto.  Maybe he works a little too
 
hard =- that's what drives him over into show biz.  (
His region is Oklahoma and his
 
especial area is music.) He's one of those "Let's give them a hand" kind of stage
 
presenters, which in context with the other things we had was a little forced.  Mike:
 
But he always managed to put in points about regionalism, about cultural geography
 
occupational skills and things like that so he was aware of what was going on.  I think
 
he functioned very well.
 
Jens Lund.  Jens was not one of those who was willing to go to the mat with a participw
 
trying to get them not to use a music stand or to do this kind of thing instead of
 
that.  He didn't take directions from the presenters meetings; he m
 did, however,
 
do a great job ox of presenting the a cappella singing convention.  He managed to get
 
in a discussion of shape note and shapes and historical information; he talked up RRd
 
at appropriate times.  Mike:  He got in a lot of information into his presentation of
 
a fiddle workshop where I was backing one of the fiddlers but it was kind of unnerving
 
the way he'd pop back and forth on stage and turn around and take pictures of the
 
participants on stage and so on.  I think he needed more experience in being used to
 
stage presence.
 Nick:  he looked uncomfortable on stage.

Subject
 . Evaluation of 1976 Festival of American Folklife
 
In considering this evaluation, it should be remembered that
 
it is usually the problems and hassles which impress themselves
 
most strongly upon one's memory. It is, however ; by taking note of
 
them that they can be avoided in similar future situations. Lest
 
the resultant picture be painted too dark, let me begin by explaining
 
that this year's Festival, even•'more so than past Festivals, provided
 
an  incomparably valuable and fulfilling opportunity to experience
 
traditions and people with whom I would otherwise have never come
 
into contact. Now that the great blur of memories i
s starting to
 
sort itself out, I appreciate even more the many magic moments, the
 
many unique and striking people, the many worlds that the Festival
 
featured. Also, the intention of this report i
s not to indict certain
 
people, or blame individuals for problems which were b
eyond their
 
control. With only the rarest exceptions, I was glad to have cordial,
 
productive working relationships with my fellow workers. And, even
 
_
more, I was lucky to have very good relations with those people I
 
supervised o
r worked most closely with. A few are cited below, but
 
special gratitude i
s felt towards Mike Herter, Bill Pearson, Al
 
McKenney, and Diana Parker; and, of c
ourse, Ralph, Bob, Bess, and
 
Tom.
 
My intention is, however, to recall the moods and attitudes
 
which obtained at the important, early stages of Festival planning
 
which directly and critically influenced the ultimate flowering of
 
events. If we plant a g
iladen and make certain mistakes in the sowing,
 
the garden may grow, but perhaps not as well as it might have. To
 
look afterwards for those mistakes is not prompted by the desire to
 
lay blame or search for moral flaws. It is, however, by examining; the
 
steps which went into any project, and by evoking the specific moods
 
and ideas which were current at the time, that we can best analyze
 
their significance. Whether or not those opinions are still held, or
 
whether the progress of events has changed the personal relationships
 
involved, it is the original factors that must be c
onsidered. Therefore,
 
this evaluation may seem sometimes harsh or unforgiving, it may seem

the same spirit of forgiveness and affection which I hope has been
 
my means of dealing with the criticisms and disappointments along
 
the way.
 
1
. GENERAL ROLE AND COMMENTS
 
There were s
everal aspects of my administrative position that
 
interfered with my most efficient and productive functioning. The
 
first is what I can formulate into a dynamic of authority: that a
 
position of responsibility and confidence creates its own authority.
 
In instances where I had a clearly delineated, publicly communicated
 
responsibility and the means to fulfill those responsibilities, it
 
was easier to secure the cooperation and help of other Festival staff
 
than it was in the areas where I was functioning without assigned
 
responsibility, or without support from above, or without a clear
 
understanding on other peoples' parts of my role. Here as well, the
 
appearance of legitimacy, the image of support and c
onfidence i
s
 
self-supporting and self-generating. If someone looks official, he
 
will be respected; if someone looks like a lone operator, he will be
 
ignored.
 
Second, there i
s an enormous difference between being involved
 
with a project from the formative stages and having input at the
 
earliest levels, and being called in (
or finally allowed in) to
 
save the game when the starting pitcher disappears between innings.
 
Worse, when a situation which exists in fact fails to be acknowledged
 
in form, the difficulties c
ited above proliferate. It is good to be
 
able to demonstrate one's capabilities in a pinch, but it is un-
fortunate when those abilities aren't perceived (
or worse, are ignored)
 
from the beginning.
 
Third, and similarly, it is demoralizing and discouraging when
 
it is deemed necessary to have someone else as "front man" to lend
 
legitimacy or improve appearances. Those whose opinions are most
 
important (
Festival staff and participants) understood my role for
 
the most part, and their appreciation and gratitude are what is
 
valuable. However, when I have done the bulk of work on s
ome project,
 
and carried it through almost to its conclusion, it is wrong to need
 
to look for someone else to accept the credit or to supply academic
 
credentials.
 
The fourth problem permeated every aspect of my Festival
 
experience - fiscal hassles. It should not be thought that all of
 
these hassles were caused by the DPA administrative staff, or that
 
the problems resulted from budget cuts. There were significant items
 
and expenditures that were forgotten or ignored at the early stages
 
of Festival planning when the budget was flexible. Two cases in point
 
were recording, and Festival Stage program and staff. Had budgetary
 
provisions for these projects been made in July of 1975,
 we would not

However, the hassles which were most fruoLraLirig  woro L
hoou c
roaL,
,d
 
or controlled by the D
PA fiscal attitude. The battles to purchase
 
sound equipment, to push through purchase orders, to get reimbursed
 
for petty cash - these were the draining, unnecessary problems which
 
consumed much of Mike Herter's and my energy throughout the Festival.
 
While we understood the fiscal bind the Festival was in, we were not
 
wasteful or exorbitant. Rather, we had our greatest problems getting
 
the bare necessities. The attitude seemed to be, "
If we hassle them
 
enough, maybe they'll stop trying to spend." There was a total lack of
 
candor and information as the fiscal status and procedures, and an
 
unresponsive posture towards requests and questions, which t
one was
 
set at the highest levels of the DPA administration.
 
These general problems will be cited below in the specific
 
instances where they affected efficient functioning and precluded
 
the successful realization of planned programs.
 
11. DOCUMENTATION
 
Documentation has long been the poor step-child of the Festival -
"How can we worry about that whoA we're trying to put on a Festival?"
 
That attitude was not changed by the piddling efforts to establish
 
an "archive". When I was assigned the task of systematizing the
 
Festival field research and documentation, I was not given the
 
logistical, technical, or administrative support necessary to make
 
it work. The extent (
small) of the Festival's c
ommitment and interest
 
in documentation was apparent to those within the programs whose
 
cooperation was vital. Intentions and lip-service alone could not
 
inspire much c
ompliance and interest on the part of program s
taff
 
when they c
ould easily perceive the Festival's disinclination to
 
_
really undertake a rigorous, scholarly approach to documentation and
 
archiving. It was impossible for me to demand field recordings from
 
programs when I c
ould not provide facilities for their future use.
 
It was pointless for me to demand field reports when I was not involved
 
at any time in reviewing them. Only in Regional America, where Bill
 
McNeil perceived the importance of archiving, was there any real
 
attempt to treat the materials properly-Consequently, throughout
 
the pre-Festival period, my energies were devoted to cataloguing past
 
tapes, and I was disinvolved in any planning or documentation for the
 
1976 Festival.
 
As mentioned above, no budgetary provision was made for s
ound
 
recordings of the Festival. Through the Fall of 1975 and Winter of
 
1976, there were several meetingsto review the 1975 recording project
 
and discuss future plans, involving such people as Ralph, Bob, Bess,
 
Tom, Brock Holmes, B
.C. May, Dot Neumann, but not me. When it was
 
finally decided to record the Festival, we wasted five months trying
 
to come up with the $ 10,000 needed to purchase tape. After one delay
 
after another, and after having one roadblock after another put in our
 
way by James Morris, we finally wound up getting a commitment, on the
 
Friday before the Festival began, for free used tapes from the Voice
 
of America. We have already gotten reports on the inferior quality of
 
I
 
that tape which caused drop-outs and other problems on the r
ecordi
.ng;_
,.
 
The uncertainty until five days before t
he Festival b
ed{an  also
 
precluded careful planning and procedures for the recording; and l
ogging.
 
Additionally, I was not involved in planning for photographic
 
documentation, video-tape documentation, and filming. When Mike Herter
 
was assigned during the Festival t
o record with the Nagra, I was
 
not present at that meeting, hearing about it from Mike. The presumed
 
reason for not involving me in these was to not add to my responsibilities,
 
but as archivist, I should have been kept informed as decisions and
 
plans were made.
 
In the final analysis, however, I was pleasantly surprised at
 
the success of the logging and recording operation. Of over 3
,000
 
tapes recorded at the FAF, all but a handful made it back to the
 
office in good order. Much credit of course goes to the volunteers
 
who showed up faithfully to log for us, and to the s
ound technicians
 
who supervised their work. Nick Vaczek did much of the early supervision
 
of this project, and after the sixth week, he assumed total supervision
 
over the logging and tape handling, taking a significant burden off
 
of Mike's and my shoulders. Had we had adequate equipment and new
 
tape, we would have a good complete record of the 1976 Festival,
 
rather than a poor complete record.
 
III. SOUND
 
In discussing the sound s
et-up for the Festival, we should
 
start before the 1975 Festival. B
.C. May and Peter Reiniger were
 
supposed to be responsible for all of the t
echnical and logistical
 
aspects of the sound systems, while I was to be responsible only for
 
recording. It became apparent two days before the Festival that they
 
.
had abdicated their responsibility, and it fell to me to assume it.
 
Along with Al McKenney and George Holt, I held together the operations
 
during two miserable weeks. Immediately after the Festival, I wrote a
 
report to Bob and Ralph on the 1975 experience, and gave them in
 
addition my recommendations for this year's staffing. (
That was to
 
have three sound staff members with technical and administrative
 
experience, on staff starting in April and May.) Throughout the Fall
 
of 1975, I attempted to discuss my evaluation and recommendations
 
with Ralph and Bob and was ignored repeatedly. Discussions in December
 
and January between Ralph, Bob, Bess, Tom, Brock, and sometimes B
.C.
 
on the question of sound were held and my presence was never solicited.
 
The resulting plan in March had Tom assuming all pre-Festival planning
 
responsibility and staff hiring and provided for only one staff
 
member who would not start until June 7
. At the beginning of May,
 
therefore, when it was discovered that half of our sound equipment
 
had been stolen, the relations between Tom and B
.C. were so s
trained
 
that it became apparent that I would have to assume responsibility
 
once again for sound planning anU7 acquiring equipment. With Nick
 
Vaczek's assistance, I determined from programs what their needs were
 
and what additional equipment needed to be purchased. Then, again

the last minute. Much of our sound equipment did not arrive until the
 
DAY BEFORE the Festival b
egan, making our carefully planned procedures
 
inoperable, and forcing us to start the Festival struggling to catch
 
UP.
 
The blanket purchase orders for musical equipment rental and
 
repairs which we had initiated months beforehand were not finally
 
completed until the second or third weeks of the Festival. The only
 
reason that we had amps and drums those first weeks was that our
 
supplier was willing to trust our good faith. In pre-Festival discussions,
 
B
.C. had indicated that we would be provided with secure storage space
 
inside the Park Police trailer for all of our mics and small equipment.
 
We were to have an office, with tables and telephones, behind the
 
Festival Stage. We indicated to B
.C. that we were ready to move down
 
to the Mall the week b
efore the Festival began. On Monday, June 14,
 
we decided we had no choice but to move down there, although there
 
were no telephones at the stage, no electricity in the tent, and no
 
place for secure storage of sound equipment. No provision had been
 
made for a pargo for Mike Herter to use in transporting sound equipment
 
(
and all of the assurances we got from Dick Lusher and Bobby Goodman
 
were worthless.) When we finally acquired a s
ecure office, in the
 
Supply Trailer, we immediately requested a telephone. They might have
 
installed one by now, but they hadn't by September 6
. (
The Festival
 
Stage finally got telephones the second week of the Festival, although
 
they were often out of service for a day or two and were c
onsistently
.
 
inaudible. Repeated requests for improved s
ervice and volume-control
 
headsets were ignored.)
 
Once we were able to develop regular procedures, the sound
 
operation proceeded without major disaster. There were two areas
 
-
which caused problems throughout the Festival - African Diaspora
 
and the Festival Stage. In Diaspora, there was a loose, confused
 
approach to the responsibility of sound operation. Every day, a
 
different person would show up asking for the equipment, often
 
a volunteer. Volunteers would be left at the stages while the stage
 
was operating and the sound technician was eating lunch or away
 
somewhere. The third stage (
the house stage) was not provided for
 
in the original staffing plans and Diaspora refused to assign ONE
 
member of their tech crew to assume on-going responsibility for it.
 
The loss or theft rate from Diaspora was higher than any other area,
 
and there were continual problems with excess volume and sound
 
interference. On the Festival Stage,the system was generally run
 
in an efficient, adequate manner. There were sometimes problems
 
caused by sound technicians exercising program control by use of
 
volume controls. That is, when they decided it was the "Merle
 
Travis" show, you could not hear Mose Rager; when they decided one
 
of the Regional gospel street s
ingers had a bad voice, they turned
 
off his vocal mic and all you could hear was his guitar. These few
 
instances when they overstepped their roles remind us of the importance
 
of having knowledgeable, sympathetic technicians who will serve the
 
music rather than shape it.

mammoth job. The t
ime and energy that f
ie put into the task, and the
 
quality of the results deserve special appreciation and commendation.
 
It is hard to think of anyone on the F
estival site who worked harder
 
and more efficiently. He and I were also fortunate t
o have a collection
 
of competent, agreeable, s
ensitive people working as sound technicians,
 
for which we are duly appreciative. Particularly helpful was Gregg
 
Lamping, who did much of the repair and maintenance throughout t
he
 
summer. To all of these people is due the credit for the consistently
 
high level of quality which characterized the sound this summer, in
 
the face of many obstacles and problems.
 
IV. SCHEDULING'AND SCHEDULE BOOK
 
During the planning stages of the Festival, I argued for having
 
stage schedules as we had in the past, the position which was agreed
 
upon. The schedules for the first few weeks, prepared when we were
 
in the office, were adequate as far as informativeness and accuracy,
 
even though they were not observed in all respects. However, once we
 
moved to the Mall, the scheduling process quickly degenerated. There was
 
less and less information each edition, and it was ignored more and
 
more by presentation staff. By the twelfth week, the same schedule
 
was reprinted five times, once for each day, although nothing changed
 
from day to day. The program book and schedule supplements were so
 
expensive they were rarely purchased. If the Festival were one week
 
or two, schedules such as these would be practical. For a longer
 
Festival, they should not be attempted. Rather, a textual description
 
of the c
ountry, region, trade, or culture featured should be developed.
 
V. FESTIVAL STAGE
 CROSS CULTURAL PROGRAMMING
 
-
 This year's Festival Stage program was patterned after the
 
1
975 program which I developed in May and June of 1
975. It seems,
 
however, that there was dissatisfaction on the part of Ralph, Bob,
 
Bess, and Tom with the 1
975 program, so that when they began planning
 
for this year's program, in January of 1
976, they excluded me from
 
any role in the Festival Stage planning or program. After much insistence,
 
I secured for myself a limited role in the preliminary l
evels of
 
programming (
which role later expanded.) More unfortunate in the
 
long run was their neglecting to make adequate budgetary provisions
 
in the Fall of 1
975 for staff and program expenses. As a result,there
 
was only money for one presenter and one participant aide. At the
 
same time, DPA had budgeted $ 55,000 for the sound system and $ 15,000
 
to construct the stage. There was no clearly enunciated purpose or
 
goal for the Festival Stage,
 except for  Ralph's repeated references
 
to it as a pressure valve to relieve crowding in other areas. It
 
started out difficult and became even more s
o to convince Festival
 
program staff members of the importance of the Festival stage, and
 
the opportunities it offered to enrich their programs and the entire
 
Festival. The basic aims and conceptual basis of the program, once
 
they were finally developed, were never adequately communicated to
 
the programs, n
o their cooperation was spotty.
 
The intended procodures for developing t
ic )
!
cstival atage
 
program were that Tom would conceptualize the individual programs
 
from field tapes, interview report cards, and the musician's
 
registry, and I would then attempt to schedule the performers he
 
identified onto the stage. B
ecause of Tom's difficulty in getting
 
the required information from programs, and because of my difficulty
 
in getting their cooperation in adjusting their schedules to accomodate
 
ours, the system never worked as intended. We soon adjusted the procedure
 
to bring the planning closer to real time rather than s
everal weeks
 
ahead of time, and, after s
everal weeks, Bill Pearson and I assumed
 
full responsibility for developing the programs and scheduling
 
participants. For the most part, this was done in the few days before
 
each week began - Saturday and Sunday for Diaspora and Regional and
 
at rehearsals on Monday and Tuesday for OW. Rehearsals were crucial
 
in providing an opportunity to observe and "audition" the performers,
 
identify good Festival Stage possibilities, and contact the field
 
workers and folklorists.
 
We were able to secure much cooperation from some of the
 
Old Ways presenters, who understood our goals, although others ignored
 
us completely. Regional and Diaspora started out reluctantly, but as
 
they came to realize we were not making impossible demands they
 
became more cooperative. With both areas, there were sometimes
 
weeks when their programs were too thin to allow any borrowing. And,
 
Regional was c
onsistently unable to inform participants in advance
 
of what their schedules were. The other factor which kept our
 
program from being as successful as it could have been was that there
 
was only one presenter - Bill Pearson. Bill was eminently capable,
 
and had an excellent rapport with participants and staff. His
 
presentations were concise and informative, and went over well with
 
the public (
from public that I talked to.) Bill deserves most of
 
the credit for the success of this year's program. However, he was
 
simply overworked - he could not adequately prepare one presentation
 
while he was on stage doing another. Had he been relieved even for
 
one or two programs each day the presentations would have benefitted
 
enormously. Two presenters would be the minimum necessary to s
tructure
 
and present programs as we conceived them. A third or fourth presenter
 
would have allowed a significant improvement in the quality of the
 
programs, by allowing much more advance preparation, and by allowing
 
the presenters to watch programs on the area stages and discuss our
 
plans with folklorists, presenters, and the participants themselves.
 
(
It should be noted that I was told before the Festival that "presenting
 
was not my strong point" and Bill was told specifically that if he
 
was sick or late or otherwise unable to make a presentation that he
 
should find Bess o
r Tom. Al McKenney was told as a condition of his
 
hiring that he could not make presentations.)
 
Al McKenney was the other member of our team. The best thing
 
I can say about him is to repeat what someone said to me while Al

If everyone on the Festival staff were like
 
Bill and Al, this whole evaluation would be superfluous.)
 
VI. FESTIVAL STAGE - LAST FOUR WEEKS
 
The Festival Stage program during the last four weeks was
 
intended to recognize some of o
ur favorite performers from this
 
summer and past festivals. Initial choices were made by Ralph,
 
Bess, Tom, Frank, Bill McNeil and Bill Pearson; Bill Pearson and
 
I contacted the performers and made substitutions when our first
 
choices were unavailable. In spite of starting late, we were able
 
to get most of those we s
ought. We were certainly the only program
 
to come in 25 % under budget. Diana Parker handled all of our
 
administrative affairs and participant c
oordination. She worked
 
long hours under the adverse conditions at the stage and made it
 
unnecessary for me to worry about anything she was responsible for.
 
.
e
 
A particular highlight of the program was the eleventh week,
 
when we were able to bring together white and black sources of
 
country music and illustrate the interchange between blacks and whites,
 
with Harmonica Frank, Mose Rager, Henry Townsend, Pearly Brown,
 
Merle Travis, and Ted Lundy. In the last week, our Cajun band
 
allowed us to demonstrate Cajun tradition from the earliest fiddle
 
and voice to a modern electric band. And, our last week,'s program
 
allowed us to thank and recognize such special friends as John
 
Jackson, Libba C
otten, Mike and Alice Seeger, Hazel Dickens, and
 
Dewey Balfa, all of whom have been steadfast in their loyalty and
 
-support for the Festival.
 
V. CONCLUSION ?
 
It is impossible to describe or sum up the effect that the
 
Festival has had on me and on its audience, throughout the years. The
 
opportunities to meet and to learn from c
ountless participants (
and
 
staff) have enriched my life immeasurably. There are so many lessons
 
they can teach, so many examples they offer of the possibilities of
 
human expression and human existence. For all the hassles and complications,
 
all the misfortunes and mistakes, the Festival has enri N d the l
ives
 
of almost everyone it has touched. It has also, we must r
ecognize,
 
caused some damage and hurt to individuals, which does not negate the
 
positive effects but reminds of how much better it could be. By accepting
 
the challenges and c
riticisms directed at all of us, we can best
 
make sure that our mistakes are not repeated, and d
evelop programs
 
and activities which produce only the desireable aspects of the
 
Festival without the occasional bad side-effects.
