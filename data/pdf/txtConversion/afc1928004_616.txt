" 
DAN DORM'S." 
[Burlesque Poem.] 
„kr delivered by PAT ROONEY, the peoples' favorite, with rounds of 1 
applause. 
The theatre was full, and so was the actors, 
Dan Dorkins was going to appear 
That night in a 
bare-footed slack wire clog, 
• 
For he was the pompey round here. 
The bar-room was perfectly crowded with beats, 
Who waited a 
pleasant surprise; [out, 
For they knew they would eat when the lunch was set 
And they longed for the curtain to rise. 
The curtain arose and so did the people, 
Who commenced for to shout and hurrah; 
Dan Dorkins came out with young Oliver Twist, 
And they gave him the laugh and" Yah, yah 
The play it began when the curtain went up, 
But something was wrong I 
felt sure; 
"He's away off his base," says old Joe Jewell, 
Who never went back on the poor. 
A 
brick! yes, it was! I 
saw Dorkins start, 
And carom on the dark-red for two; 
And it made me feel thirsty to see how he worked, 
And continually dropping his cue. 
He says: " I'm a 
king!" when a 
woman jumped up 
And says: " You lie, you are one of the gang!" 
It knocked Dorkins cold, he owed her for washing, 
And his head on his breast he did hang. 
At length to the footlights he approached with a 
rush, 
And " Ladies and gentlemen," said, 
" 
If I 
have not drank enough Bourbon to-night, 
The fault is my wealth, not my head. 
Many a 
time I 
have made you all sick, 
And get up and go out for a 
beer; 
When O'Leary and I 
walked a 
mile in a 
week, 
How I 
wish ould ' Sam Sandford' was here. 
You insult me to-night, and say I 
am sober, 
Let Tony Pastor play Hamlet alone; 
I'll tell you the reason, I 
know you won't laugh, 
I've a 
mother-in-law dead drunk at hornet"

by PAT ROONEY.

Sure I'm a 
high-toned 'ristocrat, 
As you can plainly see; 
I'm known by everybody, 
No matter where I 
may be. 
My influence is wonderful, 
Whenever I 
take the stand; 
And if you want a 
thoroughbred, 
Why Maloney is the man. 
CHORUS: 
For Maloney's a 
man, let ye understand, 
Who is well educated and tony; 
His influence is great, sure he takes the cake, 
There's no such a 
man as Maloney. 
You can see that I'm no fighter, 
And always take things cool; 
But if the boys make fun of me, 
They'll find that I'm no fool. 
I'm up and up with every one, 
There's no better in the land; 
So if you want an honest friend, 
Why Maloney is the man.

I've a 
daughter Clarabel, 
She's a 
roe- bud rich and rare; 
She wears her brother's derby 
And she bangs her own false hair. 
Her nose is Clueco-Roman, 
Her chromo you can see; 
Just gaze upon the father 
Of swect Clarabel Magee. 
Crionus. 
0! so sweet is Clarabel—.Break. 
She smashes every swell—Break. 
When she is at a 
ball 
'Twould break your heart to see, 
H'ow mashers fight to get a 
dance 
With Clarabel Magee. 
Oh! she has lots of beauxs, 
There is now a 
bitter strife 
Between Millionaires and Aldermen, 
To get her for a 
wife; 
Says she I 
can't marry all, 
Says I 
then chuck the dice and see 
What happy man will win the hand 
Of Clarabel Magee.

MULCAHEY'S COUSIN DAN. 
A Recitation. 
Written for PAT ROONEY by " Dell Morton." 
Copyrighted by A. 
J. 
FISIIER. 
The Half-Breeds and the Stalwarts 
Had a 
rough-and-tumble fight, 
The Half-Breeds had Jim Blaine for a 
leader, 
The Stalwarts said Conklin was right; 
Like Kilkenny cats they fought, 
Like bull- dogs, did growl and grin; 
And though Conklin's friends fought nobly, 
The man from Maine did win. 
Now, I'm neither a 
Half-Breed or Stalwart, 
To no party do I 
belong; 
And though for the spoils they wrangle, 
I 
say both sides were wrong. 
To settle this whole question, 
I 
have an easy plan; 
It is, to make a 
United States' Senator of 
Mulcahey's Cousin Dan. 
If Mulcahey's cousin was Senator, 
he'd make a 
change all round; 
No thieving star route jobbers 
In this country would be found; 
Beecher who says that a 
poor man 
Should live upon water and bread, 
Would have to kiss the Plymouth Church ladies, 
While he stood upon his head. 
MULCAHEY'S COUSIN DAN.—CONTINUED. 
In the Tombs windy Talmadge, 
Pour months, three times a 
year would get; 
I 
would play Billee Taylor 
In the tragedy of Olivette. 
I'd then take Susan Anthony, 
And turn her into a 
man; 
If they made a 
United States' Senator of 
Mulcahey's Cousin Dan. 
He'd sweep the sheets. of New York with Captain 
Williams, 
he'd then bounce Mayor Grace; 
And make Owney Geoghegan 
Hun the City Hall in his place. 
He'd run the 3d avenue cars to Ireland, 
And steamboats to the skies; 
he'd make bran new electric lights 
Out of the crusts of apple pies. 
He'd make Dennis Kearney president, 
Then the Chinese would have to go; 
Christina; would come in summer, 
On 4th of July we'd have snow. 
The Bulls and Bears of Wall street, 
In the Central Park would stand; 
When we make a 
United States' senator of 
Muicahey's Cousin Dan. 
MY ELDEST DAUGHTER CLARA, 
Copyrighted by A. J. Fisher, i880. 
Written by James Richmond for Pat Rooney and surs4 
by him with great success. 
Sure I 
have a 
lovely daughter, 
On the stage she cuts a 
dash, 
She wears blonde wigs and powders her face, 
To try and catch sa 
mash. 
She can dance a 
tailor's hornpipe, 
She tells the old woman that she is fine, 
She wears flesh colored pants when sh,t comes 
out to dance, 
And gets drunk on German wine. 
CHORUS. 
6he wears dizzy diamonds and wings on her back, [break 
In the ballet dance she is like a 
jumping jack, [break. 
She has a 
barrel of paint on her face, 
Like a 
fairy from Conamarra, 
The pride of the McCormick family, 
Is my eldest daughter Clara. 
You should see her in the can-can, 
She is the dead picture of her ma, 
She has a 
foot as big as a 
telegraph pole, 
Her features are like her pa. 
She has all the swells near crazy, 
An engagement for life she has signed, 
She is hitched to a 
man named Freddie McCan, 
He has a 
million dollars in his mind. 
McCORMICK'S MULE. 
Written by JAMES RICHMOND. 
Recited by PAT ROONEY with great success. 
McCormick had a 
Jack-ass, 
Blind in the teeth, lame in one eye; 
He had a 
celebrated record, 
For eating water and drinking pie; 
This Jack-ass was a 
high kicker, 
lie won many an undisputed prize; 
He kicked out seven rows of Mrs. Murphy's teeth, 
And jabbed out both her eyes. 
McCormick's Mule. 
This mule was born in Ireland, 
lie wears the Shamrock on his nose; 
At the Centennial he stole an iron safe, 
And dressed himself in a 
suit of clothes; 
He broke into a 
Jewelry store, 
Stabbed the proprietor with a 
nail; 
Chased four Policeman into the river, 
And set fire to the Jail. 
McCormick's Mule. 
McCormick was arrested, and produced the mule, 
For him all the neighbors had a 
grudge; 
He slapped the Jury in the mouth with his tail, 
And kicked the neck-tie off the Judge; 
The mule escaped, and they held McCormick, 
For the doings of the mule he was tried; 
He was just getting ten years' sentence, 
When a 
telegram came the mule had died. 
McCormick's Mule,. 
Moral on his Grave- Stone. 
Judge me as a 
Jack-
ass, 
Or judge me as a 
fool; 
I 
was smarter than some politicians, 
That went to Grammar School: 
I 
had the brains of a 
mighty man, 
But for one I 
could not pass; 
So please have printed on my grave, 
McCormick's little Jack-ass. 
Written by EDWIN TALLOT. 
PAT ROONEY'S greatest success. 
Cung also by MASTER ROBERTS with great applause as an Irish 
Song and Dance. 
Fix your eyes upon me straight, 
I 
feel so loose and airy; 
Ohl I 
can laugh, and I 
can joke, 
And never get contrary; 
I 
feel so fresh, I 
am so neat, 
I 
really shall go crazy; 
All hands roar and shout, 
I'm the funniest tarrier out. 
Cuonus: 
I'm the funniest tarrier out, 
Ohl listen while I 
spout; 
Stick your fingers in your ears, 
I'm the funniest tarrier out, 
They tell me I 
am funnier, 
Than a 
Greenhorn Chinese Cow; 
And in some German country, 
I 
will marry an Irish Frou; 
The history of my life is great, 
And wherever I 
may go; 
You'll hear comments upon my shape, 
I'm the funniest tarrier out.

My name it is McGinty, yes, 
I 
live on ham and flour, 
With O'Leary, the walker, I 
came here, 
For to walk a 
mile an hour, 
About half past twelve o'clock last nigli 
A 
gang gave me a 
terrible fright, 
They woke me up and set me tight, 
For to walk against O'Leary. 
They took mc to a 
great big field, 
And with alcohol set me crazy, 
They stripped me clothes off to the skin, 
And rt made me feel so lazy; 
It was then the gang commenced to talk, 
Saying who is the terrier going to walk, 
And they said they would hang me if I'd bauk 
When I 
walked against O'Leary. 
The first mile I 
walked my legs were weak, 
And the gang commenced to holler, 
They sptinkled salt upon the track 
And hit me with an iron dolkir. 
All the other walkers were ahead, 
Eating sponge cake, pie and bread, 
0 
heavens, I 
wish that I 
was dead, 
When I 
walked against O'Leary. 
I 
walked until I 
catched the cramps, 
Around and around the track, 
All the ladies threw bouquets at me, 
There was a 
corn upon my back; 
The judge told me it was time to stop 
As around the track like a 
chicken I'd flop, 
For the want of a 
whiskey I 
fbpugh I'd drop, 
The day I 
wantiad

MORNING ON THE IRISH COAST, 
BY 
JOHN LOCKE. 
Recited by Mr. J. 
F. 
SULLIVAN, of CRONIN & SULLIVAN, at HARRY 
MINERS'S THEATRE, N. Y., and throughout the country. 
Th' anam au Dhia! but there it is, 
The dawn on the hills of Ireland! 
God's angels lifting the night's black veil 
From the fair, sweet face of my sirelandl 
Oh, Ireland, isn't it grand you look, 
Like a 
bride in her rich adornin', 
And with all the pent up love of my heart, 
I 
bid you the top o' the mornin'. 
This one short hour pays lavishly back 
For many a 
year of mourning; 
I'd almost venture another flight, 
There's so much joy in returning— 
Watching out for the hallowed shore, 
All other attractions scornin'; 
Oh, Ireland, don't you hear me shout? 
I 
bid you the top o' the mornin'. 
Ho— ho! upon Cleena's shelving strand, 
The surges are grandly beating, 
And Kerry is pushing her headlands out 
To give us the kindly greeting; 
Into the shore the sea-birds fly 
On pinions that know no drooping; 
And out from the cliffs, with welcomes charged,' 
A 
million of waves come trooping. 
Oh, kindly, generous Irish land, 
So leal and fair and loving, 
No wonder the wandering Celt should think 
And dream of you in his roving! 
The alien home may have gems and gold— 
Shadows may never have gloomed it; 
But the heart will sigh for the absent land, 
Where the love-light first illumed it. 
INIORNING ON THE IRISH COAST— CONTINUED. 
And doesn't old Cove look charming there, 
Watching the wild waves' motion, 
Leaning her back up against the hills, 
And the tip of her toes on the ocean? 
I 
wonder I 
don't hear Shandon's bells, 
Ah, may be their chiming's over, 
For it's many a 
year since I 
began 
The life of a 
Western rover. 
For thirty summers, astore machree, 
Those hills I 
now feast my eyes on, 
Ne'er met my vision, save when they rose 
Over Memory's dim horizon. 
E'en so, 'twas grand and fair they seemed 
In the landscape spread before me; 
But dreams are dreams, and my eyes would ope 
To see Texas' sky still o'er me. 
Ah! oft upon the Texan plains, 
When the day and the chase were over, 
My thoughts would fly o'er the weary wave, 
And around this coast-line hover; 
And the prayer would rise, that some future day 
All danger and doubtings scornin', 
'I'd help to win my native land 
The light of young liberty's mornin'. 
Now fuller and truer the shore-line shows— 
Was ever a 
scene so splendid! 
I 
feel the breath of the Munster breeze, 
Thank God that my exile's ended. 
Old scenes, old songs, old friends again, 
The vale and cot I 
was born in! 
Oh, Ireland, up from my heart of hearts, 
I 
bid you the top of the mornin'.

Moloney You're Led Astray. 
Written by JoHN F. 
ADAMS, and sung by PAT ROONEY. 
My name is Mike Moloney, 
In the Fourth Ward I 
dwell, 
I 
just came here to-night 
My story for to tell. 
It's about a 
gang of roughs, 
I 
see them every day, 
When I 
go out sure they all shout, 
"I'm told you're led astray." 
CHORUS. 
They say go back to Ireland, 
And there forever stay, 
If you want to lead an honorable life, 
And not be lead astray. 
I 
got an invitation 
To attend a 
ball the other day, 
It was given by Mrs. McNally, 
Who resides across the way, 
As I 
ascended up the stairs, 
I 
heard some one say, 
" 
Here comes Moloney, let's put him back; 
Or he'll be led astray." 
They say go back, &c. 
I 
determined to go to that ball, 
Let the boys do what they may, 
So I 
went up on the landing, 
And for a 
moment there did stay. 
When they knocked me down with pillows. 
And there they let me lay, 
MOLONEY YOU'RE LED ASTRAY. 
Continued. 
( 
As they walked out I 
heard them shout, 
"Moloney, you've been led astray." 
They say go back, &c. 
I 
picked myself up and followed them, 
Just as quick as ever I 
could, 
But when I 
got out sure they were gone,/ 
So it didn't do me any good. 
I 
went to Mrs. McNally's room, 
When to me she this did say, 
("We have no ball, so I 
must confess 
That you've been led astray." 
CHORUS. 
Says I 
I'll go back to Ireland, 
And there forever I 
stay, 
For if I 
stop in America, 
• 
I 
surely will be led astray. 
Encore. 
IMy Henry is a 
preacher 
In a 
great big Brooklyn church, 
'With twenty thousand dollars every year.. 
He plays possum with the ladies, 
And leaves them in the lurch, 
And the congregation all feel very queer. 
CHORUS. 
He's a 
lady killer, he's a 
hypocrite, 
lie is like a 
Turk in war without a 
spear 
.He has had more fun than any son of a 
gun, 
And can kick as high as any Texas steer.

Then they Chase the Landlord from the Door. 
Written by Edwin Talbot for Pat Rooney and sung by him 
with great success. 
ELIE—" Never take the frorseshoe from the Door," as sung 
by Harrigan & 
Hart. 
Every month the rent is handed to the landlord, 
In the tenement house, where the families congregate, 
Then Mrs. Duffy says that Mrs. Reilly's daughter, 
In the sink threw dirty cabbage and corn mate. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, then they get a 
drinking and a 
slugging, 
It's worse than listening to the Pinafore, 
But when Kelly throws ashes at Terry Monaghans mother, 
Arrah, it's then then they chase the landlord from the 
door. 
Mrs. McNally had sixteen shirts upon a 
clothes line, 
And a 
brand new suit of dresses from the store, 
Young Kelly's son he stole them and he pawned them, 
You can bet she chased the young kid from the door. 
Last night her daughter Mary Ann the speeler, 
Was standing with a 
young man she met before, 
some one dropped out a 
scuttle full of cinders, 
To chase the dizzy lovers from the door, 
The milk is left up in the hallway every morning, 
From Jacob McCarthy's german grocery store, 
When he tries to collect his bill they give him warning, 
And chase the poor old milkman from the dour.

Empty Is The Stable, Davy's Gone. 
Written by BEN COLLINS. COPYRIGHTED, 1881, by A. 
J. 
FISHER 
Sung with great success by LESTER 8,: W ILLIAMS. 
I 
used to own a 
donkey, a 
bob-tail stubborn mule, 
He was born about the year of '49; 
His head was full of scars from stopping Railroad cars, 
He was ring-boned, spavined, deaf and blind; 
He could kick a 
steam engine, and raise you through 
the roof, 
And send you where Bob Ingersoll belongs; 
lie died at half past four, he's gone to that beautiful 
shore, 
Empty is the stable, Davy's gone. 
CHORUS: 
Gone to join the angels with spit-curls on his hair, 
Died with epizootic in the head; 
He might have gone to Congress if he only lived, 
Empty is the stable, Davy's gone. 
His hoof was like a 
slungshot, he could raise you 
through the roof, 
He'd come into the house and kick you out of bed; 
His feet was full of bunions, he could eat a 
barrel of 
onions, 
And go to sleep a 
standing on his head; 
he'd go to a 
saloon, shove his hoof through a 
spittoon 
And kick the bar into the gutter for a 
joke, 
When he laid down and dial, every mule in Jersey died 
Empty is the stable, Davy's gone. 
CHORUS: 
Davy's left the stable for the promised land, 
His overshoes and saddle are in pawn; 
No more hay he'll ever chew, they've turned him into 
glue, 
Empty is the stable Davy's gone. 
OH! FRED, TELL THEM TO STOP. 
Written and composed by GEORGE M EEN. 
Sang by EDWIN BARRY. 
His latest hit. 
No doubt you have heard of the great fancy fair, 
That used to take place every day; 
Well, I 
thought for amusement I'd take my girl there, 
To pass a 
dull hour away; 
We went in you must know, and saw Barnum's show, 
Van Amburgh's menagerie, as well; 
There were round-about swings, and all kinds of things 
Forget the day I 
never shall. 
INALootE.—Yes! when we got in the fair, my girl 
wanted to have a 
ride in the swing. I 
said, all right, my 
darling; but directly the swing went a 
little too high, silo 
lustily cried— 
CHORUS: 
Oh, Fred, tell them to stop, 
That was the cry of Maria; 
The more she said whoa, they said, let it go, 
And the swing went a 
little bit higher. 
The people that stood round of course they all laughed 
But I 
only said, stop the swing; 
There were four or five others in boats beside us, 
Saying, master don't do such a 
thing; 
Then four or five roughs caught hold of the ropes, 
Maria fell down on her knees; 
And one of them said, the young man's getting red, 
But isn't he having a 
spree. 
DIALootTE.—And Maria still cried out at the top of her 
voice— (Chorus). 
They soon stopped the swing, Maria jumped out, 
And quickly fell down on the floor; 
They brought her some water, which soon brought 
her to, 
The girl I 
now do adore.' 
Should you ever go there, to the great fancy fair, 
Friends, take advice while I 
sing; 
Of the great round-about, it's the best fun that's out. 
And finish the day with a 
swing. 
DIALOGUE.—And when you take a 
girl with you, make 
her promise she won't call out— (Chorus).

VIOLET FROM MOTHER'S GRAVE, 
Words and Music by W ILL H. Fox. 
Sung by W M. McALoox in all the principal Theatres in America, and 
by O'NEIL .&,• CONROY. 
Scenes of my childhood arise before my gaze, 
Bringing recollections of my childhood's happy days; 
When down in the meadow in childhood I 
would roam, 
But there's no one left to cheer now within my good 
old home; 
Father and Mother they have passed away, 
Sister and Brother arablaid beneath the clay; 
But while life does remain, there's one thing I'll retain, 
A 
small Violet I 
plucked from Mother's Grave. 
CHORUS: 
Only a 
Violet I 
plucked when but a 
boy, 
And often when I'm sad at.

give me joy; 
But while life does remain, in memoriutn I'll retain, 
That small violet I 
plucked from Mother's Grave. 
how well I 
remember my dear old Mother's smile, 
As she used to greet me when I 
returned from toil; 
Always knitting in the old arm chair, 
Father used to sit and read for all us children there; 
But now all is silent around the good old home, 
They all have left me in sorrow for to roam; 
While life does remain, there's one thing I'll retain, 
A 
small Violet I 
plucked from Mother's Grave.

Last Winter was a 
hard one, Mrs. Reilly, did you say? 
Well, ' tis myself that knows it, for it's many's the day 
Your husband wasn't the only man sat behind the waE; 
There's my old man McGuiness didn't get no job at all; 
The Politicians promised him Niark on the Boulevard, 
To handle a 
pick and shovel, and throw dirt on the cart. 
Ah, six months ago they promised him work he'd shortly 
get, 
But believe me, my good woman, they are promising him 
yet. 
CHORUS: 
Then cheer up, Mrs. Reilly, 
• Don't give away to the blues, 
You and I 
will cut a 
shine, 
New bonnets and new shoes; 
As for me, I'm done.a crying, 
No more will I 
sigh or sob, 
I'll wait till times gets better, 
When McGuiness gets a 
job. 
The Italians, the devil take them, why didn't they stay at 
home, 
Sure we had plenty of our own class to ate up all our own; 
They come out like bees in Summer time and sworn for to 
stay; 
The contractors they have hundreds for forty cents a 
day,

They work upon the railroad, they shovel snow and slush, 
But there's one thing in their favor, Italians they never do

No, they always bring their money home, taste no gin or

mine.

You should see him climb the ladder as nimble as a 
fox, 
Faith he's the boy can handle the ould three-cornered box, 
The boss is always bawling, Hi! there, don't you stop, 
* Keep your eyes upward, don't let no mortar drop; 
All! the old man he is always careful, nothing he let's

My name is O'Brien from Harlem, 
An Irishman as you can see; 
I 
can sing like a 
thrush or a 
starling, 
Or the little bird up in a 
tree. 
But the gang that stands there on the corner, 
Are trying the steps and the dance; 
And they shout out whenever I'm passing, 
There's O'Brien with his high-water pants. 
CHORUS: 
They tell me to go over to England, 
And pay a 
short visit to France; 
And there to bring out my new fashions, 
And call them the high-water pants. 
Last week I 
went to the theatre, 
Along with my first cousin Dan; 
We hired a 
seat down in the parquette, 
Behind the big man in the band. 
When a 
nag,er came out with a 
banjo, 
He played up a 
high-land clog dance; 
And he gave out a 
gag and. a 
con-nun-drum, 
'Bout O'Brien and his high-water pants. 
Cb•errus. 
One night as I 
strolled down the Bowery, 
Along with a 
friend, Paddy Brock. 
We tho't we'd just drop into Geoghan's, 
To try some of his rye and rock. 
When the gang all cried there's Dan O'Leary, 
The bar-keeper shot me a 
glance; 
" 
Howld your tongues " then said he to the loafers, 
That's O'Brien with his high-water pants.

I've a 
casket at home that is filled with precious gems ; 
I 
have pictures of friends dear to me, 
And I've trinkets so rare, that came many years ago. 
From my far distant home across the sea. 
But there's one -s
-weet little treasure that I'll ever dearly prize, 
Better far than all the wealth beneath the wave ; 
Tho' a 
small faded flow'ret, that I 
placed in childhood's (lays. 
'Tis a 
flower from my angel mother's grave. 
CHORUS. 
Treasured in my mem'ry like a 
happy dream, 
Are the loving words she gave, 
• 
And my heart fondly cleaves to the dry and withered leaves—. 
'Tis a 
flower from my angel mother's grave. 
In the quiet country churchyard they laid her down to sleep ; 
Close beside the old home she's at rest, 
And the low, sacred mound is enshrined within my heart, 
By the sweet ties of love forever blest. 
In the still and silent night I 
often dream of home again, 
And the visions ever tells me to be brave ; 
For the last link that binds me to the place I 
love so well, 
Is the flower from my angel mother's grave. 
Treasured in my mem'ry, &c.

Come to Casey's tin pan wedding, 
All the Irish will be there; 
Oh, such howling and such growling, 
And such cutting up so quare; 
All the Cork and Kerry people 
That resides in New York Town; 
Wearing high hats like a 
steeple, 
All the gang will sure be down. 
CHORUS: 
All the Irish will be there, 
Bring along your Bridget fair; 
Make her wear her Sunday hair, 
When in the set she's dancing; 
Won't there. be a 
how-de-how, 
When the gang gets in a 
row; 
None but buffaloes will be there, 
At Casey's Tin Pan Wedding. 
There will be ale, stale beer and whisky, 
Goose chowder and cat pie; 
And when Casey he gets tipsy, 
He will slug Riley in the eye; 
Old Pat Shay and Tim Maloney, 
From the town of Donnegal; 
Danced a 
reel for stale bologna, 
On the top of Casey's wall.

COMIC CHARACTER SONG. 
Words and music 
Sung with great success by

It's very strange indeed to me, that go where'er I 
may, 
So many queer remarks I 
hear about me every day; 
'Twas but last night upon the street, my style the boys did quiz, 
And one says " You can have it pards, if you guess what it is !" 
SPOKEN—As 
soon as they saw me they shouted, " Here it 
comes !" and as I 
approach they all began to sing— 
CHORUS. 
What is it ? heavens what is it ? 
Does it live do you know ? or is it a 
chromo ? 
Did it blow out, or did it grow out ? 
Oh ! for heaven's sake, what is it ? 
'Twas in the Park, a 
lively mob at me did talk and stare. 
" 
I 
wonder if it's loaded, and if that's all its own hair," 
"It lives, it breathes," one chap did say, its pulse is all serene. 
Approaching me " Old Krank," says he, " I'll see that you're 
kept green! 
SPOKEN—Yes, and 
" 
Look out for it, it's teethin' !" and then again comes the 
conundrum— 
when I 
say a 
word back, they shout, 
What is it, &c. 
They asked how long I 
walked alone, and say " when were 
you canned ?" 
And hint I'd look much better if upon my head I'd stand; 
And as around the Square I 
walk, with gloves and cane and 
pipe, 
I 
heard them whisper everywhere, " I 
wonder if it's ripe !" 
SPOKEN—Yes, they want to know if I'm natural or artificial, 
and how many of me there are in a 
bunch, and whether I'm

CUMBERLAND'S CREW. 
Sung with great success by Devlin & Tracy. 
Oh! shipmates, come, gather and join in my ditty, 
It's of a 
terrible battle that happened of late; 
Let each good Union-Tar shed a 
sad tear of pity, 
When he thinks of the once gallant Cumberland's fate. 
The eighth day of March told a 
terrible story, 
And many a 
brave tar to this world bid Adieu! 
Yet our Flag it was wrapt in a 
mantle of glory, 
By the heroic deeds of the Cumberland's crew. 
On that ill-fated day about ten in the morning, 
The sky it was clear, and bright shone the sun; 
The drums of the Cumberland sounded a 
warning 
That told every seaman to stand by his gun. 
An Iron-clad Frigate down on us came bearing, 
And high in the air the Rebel Flag flew; 
The Pennant of Treason she proudly was waving, 
Determined to conquer the Cumberland's crew. 
Then up spoke our Captain with stern resolution, 
Saying; my boys, of this monster now don't be dismayed. 
We swore to maintain our beloved Constitution, 
And to die for our country we are not afraid! 
We fight for the Union, our cause it is 'glorious, 
To the Stars and Stripes we will stand ever true; 
We'll sink at our quarters, or conquer victorious! 
Was answered,with cheers,from the Cumberland's crew, 
Now our gallant ship fired her guns' dreadful thunder, 
Her broad- side, like hail, on the Rebel did pour. 
The people gazed on, struck with terror and wonder, 
Th shots struck her sides and glanced harmless o'er;

It was nailed to the mast by the Cumberland's crew. 
They fought us three hours, with stern resolution, 
Till those Rebels found cannon would never avail them• 
For the Flag of Secession has no power to gall them, 
Tho' the blood from their scuppers it crimsoned the tide; 
She struck us amid-ship, our planks she did sever, 
Her sharp iron-prong pierced our noble ship through: 
And still, as they sank on that dark rolling river, 
We'll die at our guns! cried the Cumberland's crew. 
Columbia's sweet birth- right of Freedom's communion, 
Thy Flag never floated so proudly before; 
For the spirits of those that died for our Union, 
Above its broad folds now exaltingly soar 
And when our sailors in battle assemble, 
God bless our dear Banner: the Red, 'White and Blue! 
Beneath its bright Stars we'll cause tyrants to tremble, 
Or sink at our guns, like the Cumberland's crew.

THE DONKEY. 
trc.rds and Music by the late JAMES BRADLEY. 
AS 
sung 7ith 
great success all over the country by Tim ROGERS. 
I'VE got a 
donkey, he stands six foot high, 
I'll sell to the man that wishes to buy. 
He drinks Seltzer Water whenever he's dry, 
In a 
race on the turf he has never proved shy; 
He makes good time—about one mile a 
day. 
I'll match him again any stallion or bay. 
He fought for his country, he's bees through the war; 
I 
feed him on herrings, hay, rope, and tar. 
CHORUS. 
I've got a 
donkey, he's not very chunky, 
I'll trade for a 
monkey, to any old flunkey, 
Now wouldn't that be hunky, if he had my donkey, 
And I 
had his monkey, my donkey also ? 
If he's locked in the stable he'll make a 
stiff kick; 
If he wants to get out he'll pretend he is sick; 
I 
call out my donkey—his name it is Dick. 
I 
coax him along with a 
hickory stick. 
If I 
leave in his box a 
big bale of hay, 
He'll eat it all up and leave none for next day. 
Last week he broke loose, and he got astray; 
He was found in a 
sewer in Avenue A. 
I've got a 
donkey, etc, 
I 
harnessed him up last St. Patrick's day, 
I 
rode on his back so cheerful and gay, 
We started from the corner of Tenth and Broadway, 
We roue to the hall, without any delay. 
Just as we were passing by Central Park, 
A 
boy fired a 
pistol off, just for a 
lark, 
The donkey fell down, which caused a 
blockade, 
Only for fifty horse- doctors he'd spoil the parade.

. There Never was a 
Coward Where the Shamrock 
Grows. 
Respectfully dedicated to Fayette Welsh, and sung with great 
success by Edwin Talbot in his Parlor entertainments. 
Let cowardly slanderers say what they may, 
Against the dear land of my birth ; 
But I 
will maintain in spite of all foes, 
It's the clearest green spot on this earth. 
Some say we are cowards and fit for naught else 
But drinking our home-made potheen 
But I'll throw back the villainous lie in their face, 
We're as brave as the shamrock is green. 
Pat may he foolish and very often wrong, 
Pat 4 
got a 
temper which don't last very long, 
Pat is full of jollity as everybody knows. 
But there never was a 
coward where the shamrock grows. 
Tho' oppress'd and insulted for hundreds of years 
By the foe who once conquered them, they 
Have left us the courage our forefather's had— 
For that they cannot take away. 
They kept learning from us, stole all we hold dear, 
And crushed us till others cried shame; 
But in spite of it all we have struggled to learn 
That courage and wit are the same.

MACKEREL. ROW. 
Parody on Gossip Row. Written by JAS. DREW, and sung with great 
success by DONNELLY & DREW. 
Our names is John and Thomas Ryan, 
We hail from the 17th ward, 
There's an alley way in 11th Street, 
Where we both live and board. 
The trials and tribulations there, 
We will tell it to you now ; 
The neighbors fight, both day and night, 
Way up in Mackerel Row. 
Cuotms: 
Good morning, Mr. Dogface, 
And did you hear the news, 
Skinny Dick went broke last night, 
To-day he has got the blues— 
He says he never gamble, 
At the game they call faro, 
They use him for a 
billiard cue, 
Way up in Mackerel Row. 
Oh whisper :% fr, Pieface, 
To what I 
have to say, 
You threw a 
dirty tom cat, 
In my fine pot of tay ; 
You are bloated up with whiskey, 
You remind me of a 
sow— 
Its in Blackwell's Isle you otutht to be, 
Instead of Mackerel Row. 
MACKEREL ROW—CONTINUED. 
Now listen toothless Riely, 
I've a 
mind to break your jaw, 
Did you go tell the neighbors, 
That I 
killed my mother-in-law; 
When you know she's a 
daizy, 
Well I'll tell it to you now, 
She's big and stout and got the gout, 
Way up in Mackerel Row. 
CHORUS: 
There's little Owney Geoghegan, 
He lost his coat and pants, 
lie soaked them to his uncles, 
His cousin's and his aunts; 
Now he is singing comic songs, 
In Canada,, Ioho; 
And an Italian junk, he lost his monk, 
Way up in Mackerel Row. 
Now listen cranky Clow-
ley, 
What I 
have for your ear— 
1 
bear that politicians 
Are doing something queer; 
John Kelly has got the nightmare, 
And Hancock stole a 
cow, 
Mayor Grace he run a 
race, 
With a 
burn in Mackerel Row. 
Written by FRANK E. 
McNtsti s expressly for M URPHY and 
We'll tell you of a 
terrible thief, 
Who for stealing things could not be beat. 
He'd even steal the grub he'd eat, 
The man that stole the country. 
In his sleep he'd dream of what he'd done, 
And when he'd awake, the son of a 
gun, 
He'd get up and go out and steal for fun, 
The man that stole the country. 
CHORUS. 
He stole a 
horse, he stole a 
cow, 
A 
stack of hay and a 
cast-iron plow. 
Tie swiped a 
dog most dead with old age, 
A whole row of footlights off from a 
stage. 
Last night he came in this very place, 
And took the nose right off a 
man's face. 
All kinds of fish, from a 
whale to a 
perch. 
Even the steeple of Trinity Church. 
A 
pile of timber, a 
liberty pole, 
Stewart's body he must have stole. 
lie was bred of a 
family of very bad rank, 
„He stole all the bonds in Manhattan Bank. 
The Elevated Road he would ha-e 
got 
If it hadn't been riveted to the spot. 
He'd steal the tongue out of your mouth 
While you would be talking; 
He stole the shoes off O'Leary 
While he was a 
walking. 
He stole a 
mule that was dying with cramps, 
Then went out West and collared all tramps; 
Into a 
shop and sneaked out the boss, 
Over to Philadelphia and nipped Charlie Ross 
In Gilmore's Garden he collared the track, 
.1-le even tried to steal Murphy and Mack, 
THE MAN THAT STOLE THE COUNTRY,, 
Continued. 
And still he wasn't satisfied— 
The man that stole the country. 
To Blackwell's Island he was sent, 
And life-time given to repent 
Fcr things he'd done with bad intent--
The man that stole the country. 
I 
it the villain he was very bold, 
A. d 
prison walls could not him hold, 
And he's around again, so we're told— 
The man that stole the country. 
CHORUS. 
A pair of boots a 
tub, and a 
saw, 
The wc nderful man with the cast-
iron jaw. 
A 
full 'orass band, and a 
new piano, 
The ballot boxes in Louisiana. 
Presidtr,t Hayes' ulster and beaver, 
Went to New Orleans and took the fever ;

Took a

Stole all the bears there were in Wall street. 
To steal the City Hall he often did wish, 
He took the false teeth away from McNish. 
He s,ole a

Took B2ssie Turner from Theodore Tilton. 
Into a

He'd had Elizabeth, too, if it wasn't for Beecher.

THE TWO MALONES. 
Words and music by J. 
L. 
BARRETT. 
Dedicated to JOHN W ALSH. 
Sung by FERGUSON and )IAcK, 
at Tony Pastor's Theatre. 
On the 15th of September, 
We dressed up neat and gay; 
For to join a 
grand procession, 
We at once set on our way; 
There were tinkers, tailors, scavengers 
And ladies short and tall; 
All went to see the opening 
Of our lovely City Hall. 
There was Mr. Michael Murphy, 
With a 
bran new suit of clothes; 
That was made by Johnny Doherty, 
Whom everybody knows; 
Muldoon, the solid man, was there, 
As dacent as could be; 
But there wasn't one in all the lot, 
Could equal him or me. 
CHORUS • 
Did you see the two Malones, 
With their shining, bran new hats? 
Did you see them marching off 
Like two young aristocrats? 
There were flags and banners waving high, 
And dress in style was shown; 
But the greatest swells in all the lot, 
Was Pat. and Tim Malone. 
THE TWO MALONES—CONVINITED. 
The Mayor, upon the City Hall steps, 
Quite stately took his stand; 
He noticed none till we came by, 
And then he waved his hand; 
lie saw at once the style was there, 
For he stared with both his eyes; 
As if he thought we were some lords 
Or dukes dressed in disguise. 
We marched all through the city, 
Till I 
thought we'd never stop; 
So I 
fell out, and then fell into 
Magee's to take a 
drop; 
The people there were talking of 
The sights they saw that day; 
We felt a 
little flattered 
When we heard the women say— (Chorus). 
We received an invitation 
To attend a 
fancy ball; 
Without our evening dress suits, 
We couldn't go at all; 
Mr. Doherty, the tailor, 
Our measure coulan't take; 
Because, for Owney Geoghegan, sure, 
He had a 
suit to make. 
So we both went down to Baxter Street, 
Bought new suits, second hand; 
With a 
piece of shamrock in our hats, 
We looked a 
trifle grand; 
We danced about till midnight, 
And when home in the dark, 
You could scarcely walk a 
foot, 
When you'd hear some one remark—(Cho.)

TOSS THE TURK.

Price 10 cents. 
Oh I 
one evening lately, I 
dressed up nathly, 
I 
put on my Sunday clothes, plug- hat and all; 
And I 
started proudly, while whistling loudly, 
For Neal Brogan's raffle at Hibernia Hall. 
Going round a 
corner, a 
gang of rowdies: 
Oh! I 
know they're rowdies for they never work, 
Says, let give this ould Tad a 
racket, 
We will have a 
pic-nic, boys, and toss the Turk. 
CHORUS. 
Now I'm not a 
fighter, nor yet a 
biter. 
But when duty calls me I 
never shirk; 
So 
tell you plainly, tho' I 
look ungainly, 
That they had no pic-nic when they toss'd the Turk. 
Oh! the big ring-leader, a 
free lunch raider, 
Says, " O'Brien you had better paint the ' tile,' 
Put crape around it, get an axe and pound it ! " 
And he thought 'twas funny when the gang did smile. 
It was then my dander rose like a 
gander, 
For I 
heard one loafer say he'd flash a 
dirk; 
So I 
tapp'd him lightly, and surprised him quitely, 
And they had no pic-nic when they toss'd the Turk. 
'Now I'm not, etc. 
Ohl they gather'd round me, and thought to pound me, 
But I 
put my back against a 
big brick wall; 
You can't go behind me, says I, now mind me, 
If you stand forenint me I 
can bate ye all. 
Thor'- the gang did face me and thought to lace me, 
But I 
showed them tricks I 
learned at Donegal; 
Right and left I 
pounded, they were dumbfounded, 
And at last for mercy they began to bawl. 
Mpoken after 3d verse.—" Well, they looked surprised, and 
'Red Handed Mike' says, Who are you?' 
Well, says I, my 
name is Cornelius Thomas Francis Meagher O'Brien, azal.

Sung with great success by Miss Minnie Lee% 
When I 
was very young how fond I 
was of childisK joys; 
I 
loved to play among the girls, but better with the boys; 
It was pussy in the corner, tag and ineminie, 
And when my ma put me in bed I 
would steel out on the 
sly. 
I 
dared not make the slightest noise when getting back in 
bed, 
The biggest boy would boost me in my window overhead: 
I 
would go to sleep and dream I 
was a 
lady young and 
gay, 
And when my ma would take me up to her I 
used to say.. 
CHORUS-
Dance me on your knee, mother, dance me on your knee; 
Clasp your arms around my waist, it wont hurt me. 
Hold me tight, don't let me fall, I 
won't be afraid at all, 
Dance me, mother, dance me on your knee. 
13ut when I 
wore long dresses first the little boys I 
shook. 
As my ideas developed the bigger ones I 
took. 
Instead of childish games it was parties, social balls and 
drives, 
Where'er I 
went I 
had my favorite escort by my side. 
But when I 
tire of one young man, another soon I 
take, 
For there's a 
way of knowing how to give the boys a 
quiet 
shake. 
And when I 
wish to call one back a 
smile would win the 
day— - 
I 
need but look upon his face and coaxingly this say: 
Dance me on your knee, &c. 
I 
want to find a 
lover that will undertake the task, 
And understand just what I 
want, and never have to ask. 
If such can recommend himself I 
pray don't backward be, 
I3ut be sure you're brave and strong enough to dance me 
on your knee. 
There's many a 
wish a 
young girl has she don't like tot/ 
express, 
There's many a 
time we answer no, and heartily mean 
I 
always warn the fellows when we are sitting all alone, 
Be sure don't rumple up my clothes, when you dance me 
on your knee.

Dance me on your knee, &c.

As far from land as far could be, 
Far, far across the deep blue water, 
Where I'd have none to trouble me.

Sweet Maggie Gordon you are my bride, 
Come sit you down upon my knee, 
And tell to me the very reason 
Why I 
am slighted thus by thee. 
The sea is deep, I 
can't swim over, 
Neither have I 
the wings to fly, 
But I 
will hire some jolly sportsman, 
To carry o'er my love and I.

To you I

That I

Through being a

I

Until one Mike McCann, 
He came to me, and says, Duffie, 
You must run for Alderman.

In a

Where the boys of me made a 
holy show, 
When I 
ran for Alderman. 
It was in McCann's back room, 
That night they nominateeme; 
I 
axed the boys to have a 
drink, 
As they gave me three times three; 
They drank and smoked, they smoked arm] drank, 
'Till drunk was every man; 
'Twas all at the expense 
Of poor Pat Duffle, the Alderman. 
'Twas in the. &c.

The boys had all gone back on me, 
And were voting for Muldoon;

To laugh, they all began— 
Saying, we don't want no Tarrier, 
For to be our Alderman.

O'NEn, the great Irish Comedian and Vocalist with tremendous 
success, at the various theatres of the United States. 
I 
AM a 
true born Irishman, and I'll ne'er deny the same, 
I 
took a 
notion to cross the ocean, to America I 
came. 
When I 
landed here, it was in the year 1862. 
I 
was willing to fight, both day and night, for the Red, White 
and the Blue. 
I 
am your Candidate for Alderman, so believe me what I 
say, 
Put on your coats, and cast your votes, for me on Election day. 
When I 
started first in Politics, my friends they were but few, 
I 
can't forget, everyone I 
met, said that I 
was too "brand new." 
I 
worked the pipes on the Boulevard, along with Mickey Hart, 
'Fie was foreman over the old sixth ward, and the owner of a 
big ash-cart. 
I 
am your candidate. Stc. 
So now my friends I 
must be off, I 
can no longer stay, 
I 
hope you wont forget to vote, for me on Election day. 
And if I 
am the lucky man, on me you may depend, 
If you want to borrow, I 
wont be sorry, for I 
am the poor-man's 
friend. 
I 
am your candidate, tze.) ,

It was a 
snowy morning in the month of May, 
I 
discovered a 
girl falling off a 
roof; 
She landed on her nose, and busted all her clothes 
Her foot was bigger than a 
horse's hoof. 
Oh, her name it is Matilda Awful Gaul, 
She was decorated with two black eyes; 
She worked in a 
German brewery shoving froth -4 
lager beer, 
And in a 
tenement she was muzzling flies. 
CHORUS: 
Then it's lovely, cross-eyed Cinder Ella, 
Just as fat a'S a 
one dollar umbrella; 
You have won my heart, and stole my watch and chain. 
You have swelled my pocketbook for bottles of wine; 
I 
will meet you in the gutter outside the slaughter house. 
About twenty minutes after half-past nine. 
We met her bottling fog upon the river, 
And received an invitation to have a 
dinner; 
Her breath it was so strong it turned ice into hot water, 
And her nose was red from being a 
terrible ginner. 
She lived seven flights upstairs in an alley, 
We took the cars and soon got to the top; 
She collared all my money and stabbed me in the neck, 
And then was going to shoot me with a 
pop.

Across the ocean wild and wide; 
To where your heart has ever been,

The roses all have left your cheek, 
I've watched them fade away and die; 
Your voice is sad when e'er you speak, 
And tears bedim your loving eyes. 
CHORUS: 
Oh, I 
will take you back, Kathleen, 
Wo where your heart will feel no pain; 
And when the fields are fresh and green, 
I'll take you to your home again. 
I 
know you love me, Kathleen, dear, 
Your heart was ever fond and true:

I

That life holds nothing dear but you. 
The smiles that once you gave to me,

But may still in obscurity live; 
While shallower mortals successfully shine, 
And take all the world has to give; 
One waits on in vain, for good fortune's caress, 
While the other some chance may befall; 
Which used to advantage results in success, 
So, here's jolly good luck to us all. (Chorus). 
So, up and be doing, deserving good luck, 
And good fortune may favor the brave; 
For some of life's prizes are won by sheer pluck, 
And are lost by the indolent slave; 
There is always one chance in the life of a 
man, 
Which, if lost, he can never recall; 
So work for it, watc'h for it, hope if you can, 
That there's jolly good luck for us all. (Chorus).

JAMES O'NEIL'S PARODY ON 
Grandmother's Chair. 
Revised and sung by JAMES O'NEIL & JOHN CONROY, in all the 
leading Variety Theatres in the United States. 
My Grandfather he, at the age of 1,000 and 3, 
lie worked upon a 
farm catching bees; 
It was him discovered pie, and he had a 
leather eye, 
And his necktie was a 
boarding house for fleas; 
His lungs was made of wood, and he never was any 
good, 
lie could walk upon the water and never sink; 
His nose was very long, and his breath was very strong, 
He'd chew up porous plasters, soap and ink. 
CUOIICS: 
But now lie has departed, he bought a 
pair of wings to fly, 
Now he's painting clouds and frescoing the sky; 
He'd never refuse a 
drink, and lie always had blues, 
And when he died he left Dr. Tanner his old pair of shoes. 
When he grew up to be a 
man, he had five toes upon 
each hand, 
And he married a 
girl called Arrabella Green; 
They were married just one year, and don't you think 
it queer, 
They had a 
family the finest ever seen; 
While smoking a 
clay pipe, his eldest boy named Mike, 
Was playing with a 
puzzle made of blocks; 
When seven million dollars and 3,000 paper collars, 
Fell out of my Grandfather's socks. 
(Chorus). 
He was never known to eat, he had 14 set of teeth, 
And he never wore pants in all his life; 
lie was crossed in his thumbs, he had whiskers on his 
gums, 
And with ice cream he tried to choke his wife; 
One day he pawned his eye for to buy some rock and rye, 
He got wrestling with a 
brick and broke his head; 
He slept upon a 
box, he never changed his socks, 
And now I'm told the poor old man is dead. 
(Chorus).

You talk about your drummers— 
Ve're der finest in der corps— 
Ye serv'd our dime in sixdy-nine, 
In de Franco-Prussian War ; 
Are got medals from King William, 
Vhich we justly do deserve, 
For drumming in dat army, yes, 
And displaying spunk and nerve. 
Cuonus 
For ven you see us brave huzzars, 
Our helmets shine, just like der stars. 
Our noble flag shows many a

For we are known as der brave huzzars. 
De Americans love der nation, 
And der Germans, too, der same, 
For fighting for our liberty, 
Dat is our greatest fame; 
Yen ve meet oder regiments, 
No jealousy we show, 
Ye lend a 
helping hand to all, 
No matter high or low,

The Greatest Trick Book of the Age. 
IT PLEASES BOTH OLD AND YOUNG, 
Ft is a Fac simile of 
a Trick practiced by all 
the Professors of magic. 
WW•etr"",""" 
It is arranged so systematically, and is accom-
panied -with directions so plainly written, that, with 
a 
single perusal, any person may become an adept 
in an unfailing source of amusement. 
Bead what a leading Journal says of it: 
" 
An ingenious little book of the thaumaturgic order 
has been sent us, called 
EtIIMPTY DIIMPTY,' and bound 
in such a 
way as to give opportunity for a, decidedly 
puzzling trick. 
While presenting the ordinary appear-
ance of a 
child's picture-book, gayly printed and colored, 
it is so bound that a 
practiced manipulator, taking it 
up, and flirting the leaves rapidly over, can make it ap-
pear to be filled with copies of only one picture, or with 
blank pages, or with any one of quite a 
succession of 
figures. 
One minute the pamphlet, quickly thumbed, 
appears to contain nothing but portraits of Harlequin, 
in his tesselated. suit; the next, only Columbine; then, 
nothing but Pantaloon, or Riding Hood, or Mephisto-
pheles. A little practice, and the directions printed 
with the book will make anybody at,home in the hand-
ling of it."—Phila. Evening Bulletin.
