I 
wear two lovely emblems, 
I 
wear them on my breast, 
The harp entwined with shamrock 
Is the emblem I 
love best, 
They're symbols of old Erin, 
The place that gave me birth, 
The sacred spot of Erin 
Is the clearest spot on earth. 
CHORUS. 
The harp and the shamrock of Erin, 
The -harp and the shamrock for me, 
When ' ere my voice I 
raise I'll always sing in praise 
Of the harp and shamrock of Erin. 
When I 
see a 
bunch of shamrocks 
I 
think of St. Patrick's day, 
And if I 
hear its tune struck up, 
It makes my heart feel gay, 
My spirit overcomes me, 
And on Erin sweet I 
call, 
Just touch the harp of Erin, 
And I'll sing Tara's Hall. 
The old stone cross of Ireland, 
Is an emblem great and grand, 
With the wolf dog resting calmly 
Near the round towers of our land, 
Their relies dear to Irishmen. 
No matter where I 
roam, 
Good men are always firm and true 
To emblems of their own.

Always Speak A Kind Word When 
You Can. 
Originally sung by W ILL H. 
lloirroN, America's Comique, at the Park 
Novelty Theatre, Brooklyn. 
New sayings are all the rage on the street and on the stage 
And many a 
glorious maxim you may find, 
But there's one more than the rest seems to linger in my 
breast, 
And often comes a 
floating o'er my mind, 
I 
will tell you here to-night this motto true and bright, 
A 
lesson it conveys sublime and grand, 
To the beggar at your door, to all people rich or poor, 
Always speak a 
kind word when you can. 
UTTERCUPS AND DAISIES.., 
tten by BOBBY Nrwcolun expressly for W ILL H. 
Moirrox, America's 
Comique. 
When a 
little boy I 
wandered, 'twas a 
pleasant summer's 
day, 
My heart was like a 
feather as I 
journeyed on my way, 
To my eager footsteps soft the green grass laid, 
With a 
little playmate, such a 
tiny maid, • 
Playing I 
was poor man, playing she wa4. rich, 
flow her merry laughter reached the highest pitch, 
Pointing to the daisies silver wealth untold, 
Buttercups unnumbered, these she said were gold. 
With the time departing soon the air was chilled, 
Now if perchance you meet an old friend upon the street, 
Out upon the crisp wind loud the robin thrilled, 
lie is poor and all the world may sneer at him, 
Oh, do not pass him by in despair to live or die, 
But remember that his poverty is no sin, 
Then help him with a 
will, show that you respect him still, 
Welcome him and grasp him by the hand, 
Do not turn your head away, but remember what I 
say, 
Always speak a 
kind word when you can. 
, 
There's many and many a 
man who no riches can command 
Yet he may be the noblest of them all, 
Many a 
glorious deed he's done, many a 
victory he has won 
Yet his honors and rewards are very small, 
But when he's dead and gone, his loss they deeply mourn' 
He's a 
monument of friends on every hand, 
And his praises they relate when they know it is too late, 
For they never speak a 
kind word when they can. 
Onc2 again I 
wandered with my little maid, 
To our treasure garden vast in wealth arrayed, 
Soon we knew a 
robber, Jack Frost was his name, 
f
Had been there before us and taken all our gain 
With his icy fingers and a 
grasp so cold 
Stole our silver daises and buttercups of gold. 
Ian's estate I 
reached then, but I 
ne'er forgot 
My little maid companion and our treasure spot, 
or there was a 
lesson in our strange belief, 
Summer was our banker, Winter was our thief, 
So it is with friends, then sometimes so with all, 
They're true to us in sunshine but leave us in the fall, 
When a 
warm friend slights me or he treats me cold, 
I 
think of silver daisies and buttercups of gold,

I knew a

As member of the National Guards, 
A

When marching down Broadway, 
As I

One pleasant Summer's day

His dark eyes are as sparkling as 
The dew drops on the trees. 
And when he wears his soldier's clothes 
The ladies he doth please, 
As down Broadway they gaily marched, 
Flags and banners flying 
He touched his cap and gaily smiled 
While to the column crying.

I 
saw his bow so full of grace, 
The glance of his bright eye, 
It sent the blood into my face,

But one short month has scarcely fled, 
And I'm to be his bride, 
I'll ne'er forget that happy day, 
When to his men he cried.

THE LAGER KEG. 
PARODY. 
Written by SAUL SERTREW. 
AIR. —" The Water Mill." 
Listen to the lager beer all the live long day, 
Buzzing in its little keg, mad to get away, 
Rushing reckless in the glass when you turn the peg, 
Never coming back again to that lager keg, 
Then this reckless lager beer comes to grief at last, 
Th3 keg will never buzz again with the lager that 
has passed. 
Many are the schooners now, Johnny, you and I, 
We have got away with, 0, when our lips were dry, 
And the happy times we've had with our friends so gay, 
Shaking for thislager beer and seeing who should pay, 
But those happy times are gone I 
am broke at last, 
The keg will never buzz again with the lager that 
has passed. 
Take this lesson to yourself every one of you, 
Always look before you leap, that's the way to do, 
Don't be like this lager keg, rushing to the brink, 
Gobbled by some Dutchman then thirsting for a 
drink 
When you've got a 
good thing now keep it, clinch it 
fast, 
The keg will never buzz again with the lager that 
has passed.

TAKE HEED, 0. LEST YE FALL 
Written by SAITL SERTILEW. 
I'll sing to you a 
little song, 
And when you've heard me through, 
If you will follow up the plan, 
'Twill make a 
man of you, 
The subject now I 
sing to you 
And your attention call, 
Is when you're high up in the world, 
Take heed, 0, lest ye fall.

Take heed, 0, lest ye fall I 
say, 
Take heed, 0, lest ye fall, 
0, when you're high up in the world, 
Take heed, 0, lest ye fall. 
When up the ladder climbing, boys, 
Look out as you ascend, 
Though all appears so firm and true, 
Sometimes the spokes will bend, 
To warn you they are frail and weak 
And not to trust them all, 
Be firm, look out, be careful, boys, 
Take heed, 0, lest ye fall. 
(Chorus 
When fame and riches make you proud, 
You hold your head up high, 
And when you meet with friends so poor 
You pass them coldly by, 
Don't be to sure, though you may think 
You're safe above them all, 
There's many a 
slip 'tween cup and lip, 
And you may have a 
fall. 
(Chorus). 
Temptations now of every kind, 
You'll meet with every day, 
And all that art can now impart 
To charm you on so gay, 
But when they've led you to the brink, 
0, my advice to all, 
Be firm, look out, be careful now, 
Take heed, 0, lest ye fall. 
(Chorus). 
Now when you get invited out 
With jolly friends to dine, 
And overflow with happiness 
And lull or fun and wine, 
0, don't forget when you come home 
And lean against the wall, 
And sing ;` Shoo fly, don't bodder me," 
Take heed, 0, lest ye fall.

Words by It. F.. O'BRIEN. 
Sung by W ILL H. 
Aloirros. 
Winter twilight fades away, 
Darker grows the shadows, 
Sweetly falls the sun's last ray, 
On the distant meadows; 
Seated close by Harry Vane, 
Watching days' declining, 
Faces pressed against the pane, 
For each other pining, 
CHORUS. 
Courting in the twilight, 
Courting in the park; 
'Neither one can equal, 
Courting in the dark. 
Mother turns the lamp up bright, 
And to rest retires, 
But I 
think it isn't right, 
Gently dim it's fires; 
Soon it burns with fainter ray, 
Dimmer still and dimmer, 
But for fear of what " they say," 
There's the slightest glimmer. 
(Chorus. 
Mother shakes her wise old head, 
With a 
merry meaning, 
When on rising from her bed, 
She, the lamp is cleaning; 
But I 
vow my handsome beau 
Left at half past seven, 
Mother fancies, doesn't know, 
It was near eleven.

When telling that same ancient story, 
That's new since the days of the ark, 
That soul thrilling moment of pleasure, 
That gleam of love's light thro' the dark; 
Our hopes and our fears are all waiting, 
One word from a

If " yes" life's best nectar we sip.

Our hopes and our fears are all waiting, 
One word from a 
fair maiden's lip, 
If " no" all the world is a 
desert, 
If " yes" life's best nectar we sip. 
A 
blessing, just then, is a 
baby, 
Who comes as if sent from above, 
To say to our sweetheart that really, 
"What we call ' espect, he calls love;" 
And when the sweet damsel surrenders, 
Excuse for most exquisite bliss, 
The quiet remark of the young one, 
"Whoever I 
love, why, I 
kiss." 
(Chorus). 
" 
babies, though mar-plots, you're jewels," 
If one has the talent to take 
The proper amount of advantage, 
Of all the queer blunders you make ; 
And many a 
lover has reason, 
To bless for the whole of his life, 
The infant whose timely intrusion, 
Compelled him to ask for his wife.

I'se longing for the good ole times we used to hab of yore 
When we labored in de cotton and de corn, 
And Wry night de darkies gather'd 'round de cabin door 
To de calling ob de mellow bugle horn; 
We

And eb'ry charming yaller gal would to her lover cling, 
While all our hearts were honest, kind and true.

De ole fiddle and de bones made music too. 
And eb'ry charming yaller gal would to her lover cling, 
While all our hearts were honest, kind and true. 
Our ole massa used to like de fun and laugh'd to see de reels 
Dat the boys and girls were always sure to dance, 
And when the " picaninny nigs" would turn upon dar heels 
Be ole man would join dem in dar merry prance; 
Tho' he used to give us blows when among de cotton rows, 
He was kind to us when daily toil was o'er, 
And eb'ry one dat worked upon the old plantation knows 
His heart was bigger dan our sunny shore.

We have heard he joined de army after sending us away 
And was killed in battle down in Tennessee, 
And some one else has told us dat dey heard ole missus say

If de last report is so, all of us would gladly go 
And shed upon his grave a

For eber since we left him we have felt the keenest woe, 
Dar's nothing for de worn out darkey here.

And when he is promoted,

The Gal With The Broad Brim Hat 
Written by sarL SERTREW. 
Am. -" Belle of Fifth Avenue." 
The other day while strolling 
Through Central Park so gay, 
To see the sights and fashions 
And pass the time away, 
I 
met with lots of charmers 
And gayly did they chat, 
But the one that took my fancy 
Was a 
gal with a 
broad brim hat. 
Spoke — Yes, she wore one of those fly away broad bri 
hats, and she looked as if she had just bounced througl . 
circus balloon and ithad caught on her back hair, and— 
Cnonts. 
She won my heart completely, 
But I 
shall ne'er forget 
My trials and tribulations for 
This gal with the broad brim hat 
She told me she was s!ngle 
And lived in Avenue A, 
Iler father was a 
preacher 
On morals of the day, 
I'd have to be so careful. 
Her father was in fact, 
The strictest man you ever saw 
With the gal with the broad brim hat. 
Spoken.—Yes,, she was one of those guileless girls 
y 
ou would stand up for and have your clothes all torn 
pieces to be her gladiator. 
Cloru.8). 
That night I 
called upon her, 
The parlor it was full, 
I 
thought there was a 
raffle 
Or a 
young men's sparring school, 
And soon I 
met her brother, 
With him I 
had a 
chat, 
He said " those fellows all were sweet" 
On the gal with the broad brim hat. 
Spoken. — When I 
saw the crowd I 
didn't think there 
was much show for me and I 
was about to bolt when the 
young lady said I 
needn't be afraid, they were all gentle-
men's sons from the Gth ward. She very pressingly requested 
me to linger and I 
couldn't very well refuse her, for— 
(Chorus). 
There was " Nobby Jim, the Bouncer," 
Who everybody fears, 
And " Bully Mike, the Buffer," 
Who chawed off four men's ears, 
And " Jersey Sam, the Gouger," 
And " Pat McCann, the Rat," 
Who said he'd put a 
head on me 
For the gal with the broad brim hat. 
Sen. —It was a 
healthy crowd. 
When I 
came in they 
were all chewing sand paper. 
One shyed a 
glance at me 
and asked bow much I 
weighed ? 
Another said, " You're 
a 
nice plum, here's a 
gum drop for you." 
I 
thanked him 
and be said " What der yer say ?" 
Then the gal came in 
and asked me to waltz with her, and as I 
danced around I 
felt like a 
fellow up to his neck in honey with a 
boxing-
glove under his nose.

[THE GAL WITH THE BROAD BRIM HAT.— Continued]. 
The gal was fond of singing, 
I 
thought I'd do the grand, 
And sung " I'm Dreaming Love of Thee," 
To the air of " Branigan's Band," 
Some fellow said, " Oh, shoot it," 
Another one said " Scat," 
And bounced me down ten flights of stairs, 
For the gal with the broad brim hat. 
Spoken. — It was a 
base ball match and I 
was the ball and 
got bounced, but I 
stuck to the girl, for—
 
(Chorus). 
I 
thought there was a 
derrick 
Had raised me in the air, 
I 
felt just like a 
base ball 
A 
bouncing here and there. 
I 
looked just like a 
fish net 
Or a 
drowned long tail rat 
When that crowd got through a

For that girl with the broad brim hat. 
Spoken. — Yes, I 
looked as if I 
had passed through the 
hands of a 
lot of shoe makers. I 
was soled, heeled and 
footed. 
But nevertheless I 
didn't give up the girl for— 
(Chorus). 
Oh, what I 
had to suffer 
'Twould break your heart to hear, 
But now my troubles over 
And nothing more to fear, 
I 
persevered and won her 
And everything is gay, 
And we live in a 
brown stone cupola 
'Up in Avenue A.

I 
live up town in Harlem. 
Every morning out I 
crawl, 
Perhaps I 
come to tOwn, 
Perhaps don't come at all. 
My movements are uncertain, 
And curious folks I 
pity. 
For they would like to know quite well, 
What I 
do in the city. 
Spoken—My neighbors can't find out what I 
do for a 
living; 
they have all come to the conclusion, however, that I 
do—

SWEET CAMILLA MAY,

Delehanty 
Hengler's Champion Song and Dane 
IN an ivy-covered cottage, 
Hidden back of oaken trees, 
Lives a 
lovely little maiden, 
Just as happy as you please. 
Where upon a 
low veranda, 
Every Summer's eventide, 
I 
sit amid the flow'rs fair— 
Camilla by my side. 
CHOltrg. 
Ali among the roses, 
Making sweet proposes, 
Lovely, laughing, soul-bewitching. 
Sweet Camilla May. 
Captivating, aggravating,' 
Never tired of play, 
Flitting like a 
little birdie— 
Happy all the day, 
Oh I 
kill me or I'll die with lo 
For sweet Camilla May. 
Ohl I 
met this merry maiden, 
Just a 
week ago to-day, 
among the pretty flowers, 
Triming mignonettes s. gay. 
And I 
asked her for a 
single rose, 
And this I 
heard her say,— 
Take this sweet forget-me-not, 
From Miss Camilla May. 
All among the Roses, JEc. 
Wilh a 
little white eamelia, 
Gleaming in her dusky hair, 
Lovely violets and roses, 
Blooming in her face so fair, 
Little stars and merry sunshine 
In her eyes so bright and gay, 
There's a 
choir of angels singing— 
In the voice of Milly May. 
All among the Roses, A:c.. 
Now I 
bid you to remember, 
If in love you chance to be, 
Try and keep in all your feelings. 
Don't act foolishly, like me. 
For I 
live on hoping, dreaming 
Of a 
coming happy day, 
When I'll make of one camelia, 
Such a 
lovely sweet " bouquet." 
All among the Roses, 
OUR FRONT STOOP.

I'm the lather of a 
family, 
Six girls and one big boy, 
With the neighbors they are friendly 
They are their mother's joy: 
It's every summer evening, 
When the heat would make you droop; 
Friends there meet from every street 
To gossip on our front stoop. 
'There's dainty Misses Grogan, 
Alexander McAfee, 
The undertaker Hogan, 
The pride of Calvary. 
Such splendid vocalization, 
'Twould burst an opera troupe; 
The Sweet By and By would make a 
mat, ate, 
As sung on our front stoop. 
They talk about the Murphys, 
And say they put on style, 
And how their daughter Mary 
Went down to C-oney Isle 
With a 
German music teacher, 
Who filled her with clam soup, 
Then they say, don't give it away, 
What you hear on our front stoop. 
You'd have to run the gauntlet, 
If ye were walking by, 
They'd have your family history 
In the twinkling of an eye. 
They'd turn you gently over, 
While they 
it there in a 
group, 
They'd give to you sweet Ballyhoo, 
While passing our front stoop. 
They send Kate with a 
pitcher, 
For Cincinnati beer; 
Then their conversation 
For a 
mile or two you'll hear, 
They talk about the babies, 
The whooping coughs and croup, 
Whea the moon's out in sight, they say good night, 
And go home from our front stoop.

BEHIND THE SCENES, 
As sung by WILL. MORTON. 
When but a 
little boy, oh, it really was my joy 
To visit the theatre, I'll admit, 
And how happy I 
would be, the performances to see 
While seated in the gallery or pit. 
I 
fancied all was real, that the curtain did reveal, 
But since that I 
have passed beyond my teens; 
I 
begin to understand, though in front it may look grand 
It's very different just behind the scenes. 
So if if you will attend for a 
moment, now my friends, 
I'll do the best within my humble means, 
To show to you to-night, though in front it may look bright 
It's very different just behind the scenes. 
The comedian is one, who, while causing lots of fun, 
His heart may yet hang heavy in his breast; 
And he who plays the king, though it seems a 
curious thing, 
In private may be very poorly dressed. 
Then the ballet girl so fair, who goes floating through the nit 
And looks like little angels there instead ; 
Sometimes they have to roam, into a 
wretched home, 
And oftentimes go supperless to bed. 
And those who play the parts, of the men with stony hearts, 
And look as if their tempers were like fiends; 
Could you see them while away, you certainly would say 
They're the mildest looking men behind the scenes. 
Now there's many a 
married pair, I've no doubt you are awa 
Who in public are so tender and so kind; 
But could you only see them at home in privacy, 
A 
very different state of things you'd find. 
Sometimes it is the wife who causes all the strife, 
Sometimes it is the husband who's to blame; 
35 
But be that as it may, who causes all the fray, 
Their quarreling continues just the same. 
And oft they try to hide from all the world outside, 
The snarls and jars with which their household teems , 
And often when you hear them call each other dear, 
They hate each other just behind the scenes. 
Now . 
its just the sam:J in life, though what lots of care and 
strife. 
And suflering some folks will undergo 
Just to cut a 
shine, and to make themselves look fine, 
They think of nothing else but outside show. 
Some fancy and suppose, that those who wear good clothes, 
Always are they richest and the best ; 
But an honest heart and mind, is respected most you'll find, 
No matter whether rich or poorly dressed. 
Then ri0 matter where we go, from the highest to the low, 
From peasantry ' way u;) to kings or queens. 
Whatever we enjoy, therOs something to annoy, 
if we *mid only peep behind the scenes.

No pivoter could equal her,

And as we'd spin around 
They'd say, " Ain't she a

Then I'd ta-ta up to the bar

We are the Murphy twins, 
From the County of Kildare, 
We just arrived this morning, 
At the Castle Garden pier; 
We are looking out for Mulberry Street, 
Where lives our brother Dan, 
He is an American citizen, 
Likewise an alderman. 
CHORUS. 
We are the Murphy twins, 
From the County of Kildare, 
We have just arrived this morning, 
At Castle Garden pier; 
We crossed the stormy ocean, 
To become American citizens, 
Where could you find an Irish pair 
Could beat the Murphy twins. 
The morning we left Kildare, 
Our mother she did say— 
Hold up your heads me children, 
For you are going to America; 
You may become aristocrats, 
Or Democrats, you know, 
But don't forget old Ireland, 
Wherever you may go. 
We are, etc.

GOD HELP OUR SUFFERING POOR, 
Written and sung by Wm,. H. Moms with HARRIGAN 
HART'S Combinatica. 
While the sad cry of hard times resound through our land 
Do we give enough thought to the poor; 
Are we one and all ready to lend helping hand, 
To drive the grim wolf from the door. 
The selfish raay think that kind fortune has dealt, 
With them and their own to secure 
The comforts and blessings that money can bring, 
But God help our suffering poor. 
There are plenty we meet who could help if they would, 
But the fact is their money's all spent; 
They're too poor themselves, or they ain't in the mood, 
Or some other excuse they'll invent. 
But ask yon rich banker how much in his vaults 
These men have placed there to secure; 
And he'll tell you, if honest, their assertions are false, 
They could help our suffering poor. 
Can any one tell why those seeking for aid 
Always pass mLionaires with distrust? 
Can it be solem:..ruth, what I've often heard said, 
That the rich seldom give e'en a 
crust? 
But there's the mechanic and laboring man, 
Ever ready to share Ii s 
small store, 
For nearly each one knows how ' Lis himself, 
God bless these true friends to the poor.

We are swells of the first water, 
Our dress is quite sublime, 
Admired in every inarter,

GIVE THE WORKINGMAN A CHANCE . 
As originally sung by WILL H. MORTON, at Howard Atheneum. 
Boston, Mass. 
Some boast of wealth and riches, but give me the hardy hand. 
Give me the honest workingman. the pride of every land: 
The man that earns his living by the sweat of labor's brow, 
That wields the axe, the pick, the spade, or stands behind the 
plough, 
lovt, 
the sons of manly toil, they built up our success. 
And made a 
mi-hty nation of this western wilderness; 
onto our bright protecting stars they nobly did advance, 
For well they knew our iiag would give each workingman 
chance. 
They spanned the mighty prairie, they enriched the American 
soil, 
They built each railroad in the land, these sons of hardy toil: 
In vain did other climes compete, our vessels swept the sea, 
For labor ws our bond of strength. bright labor. strong and 
free. 
I 
envy not the titled lord, nor yet the man of wealth. 
I'd rather have the sinews strong, that tinge of ruddy health, 
That labor gives to all tier sons whose watchword is advance. 
What made our  
at success—we gave our workingman a 
chance. 
Let England send her hardy sons, to them we'll give the hand. 
We can't fors-et that Washington sprang from the motherland, 
Let Germany her thousands send, to leave their sunny Rhine. 
And Russia, from her icy plains, in countless thousands join. 
Let Ireland send each manly form, no tyrant here does stand, 
A 
welcome sweet we'll give to all in our bright Western land, 
Come from the borne of Lafayette— the sunlit bills of France, 
For ' tis our greatest joy to give each working-man a 
chance.

COME, gather ye cracksmen 
And ganiffs so fly,

Of the blokes doing time 
On the Isle de BlackwelL 
CHORUS. 
With my one, two, and three four, 
Then all in a

To the shoe shop and quarry 
Each bloke must keep time. 
We work like a

Then back to our cell, 
Such a 
grand institution 
Is the Isle de Blackwell. 
Oh, there is a

Who'd sugar galore, 
He hypothecated to - 
The Canada shore.

He tripped and he fell, 
Singing Moody and Sankey 
On the Isle de Blackwell. 
With my one, two, etc. 
Oh there is a

'Tis a

He was nabbed by a

A-shoving the queer.

DORKINS THE ACTOR, 
Written by BOBBY NEWCOMB, and sang with great success by 
W ILL. H. 
MORTON, with HARRIGAN & HART'S 
Combination. 
(2cew version.) 
The theatre was full, it was Dorkins' night— 
That is, Dorkins was going to play, 
A 
character new to himself and the stage 
That he'd trod for so many a 
day. 
By eight the theatre was perfectly jammed, 
All awaited a 
pleasant surprise, 
For they knew they would laugh till their sides would ache, 
And they longed for the curtain to rise. 
The play soon began, each neck was stretched forth, 
And eagerly watched each eye 
For Dorkins to make his first entrance, and then 
To give him a 
cheerful Hi, Hi! 
He soon appeared amidst loud applause, 
But something was wrong you could see: 
Why Dorkins is playing quite badly to- night, 
The people said sitting around me. 
A 
hiss? yes, it was : I 
saw Dorkins start, 
As though stung by a 
serpent's fang. 
Then he cast a 
beseeching look all around, 
And his head on his breast did hang. 
Some said he was drunk, and I 
thought so myself, 
For to me it was awful at times. 
To see how he'd struggle along with his part, 
And continually stick in his lines. 
At last he the footlights then slowly approached, 
And ladies and gentlemen said, 
Believe me, if I 
cannot please you to- night, 
The faults not the heart but the head; 
Many a 
time I 
made you all laugh, 
When I 
was scarce able to stand, - 
And every effort was pain to me then, 
Yes, if I'd raise but my hand. 
You hiss me to- night, and say that I'm drunk; 
From his breast came a 
sob and a 
moan, 
When I 
tell you the reason, I 
know you won't laugh, 
I've a 
little one dying at home,

THAT'S ,,WEEN I_ONJWILL-,KNOW WHO'S 
YOUR FRIEND- - 
Written and sung by BEN DODGE. 
To my true friend W ILL 
H. 3IorrroN. 
- 
It's all very foolish to boast of your friends, 
And imagine them faithful and true; 
In the hour of misfortue you surely will find 
There's no one with friendship for you. 
Your child may be starving and crying for bread. 
No one has a 
penny to lend 
To help drive the dread wolf away from your door— 
That's when you will know who's your friend. 
CHORUS. 
Then take my advice—it is said for your good— 
Bear in mind I 
don't wish to offend; 
Being saving of cash, and keep plenty on hand, 
And you never will want for a 
friend. 
While jogging along through the journey of life, 
You are sure to meet sorrow and care; 
But fight boldly onward, throngh thick and through thin, 
And never give pp in despair. 
Be honest and upright, whatever you do; 
Your honor at all times defend— 
All men will look up to you then with respect, 
And be r.roud to be known as your friend. 
• 
Then take my advice, (!cc.

JOHNNY MORGAN PLAYS THE ORGAN; 
Music published by W HITE, SMITH & Co., 516 Washington St., 
Boston. 
Price 35 cents. 
I'LL sing of a 
band that used to play 
Music in the street, 
And if you heard it you would say 
It was anything but sweet. 
They all played different instruments, 
The music was the same, 
They were all one family, 
And Morgan was their name. 
Johnny Morgan played the organ, 
The father beat the drum, 
The sister played the tambourine, 
The brother went porn, porn, porn—porn, porn, porn, 
All alone on an old trombone; 
The music was so sweet 
They often got a 
penny 
To go into another street. 
They used to say that Johnny WilS 
The smartest of them all, 
And round the area windows 
He would often make a 
call. 
His music was so lively, 
All the latest airs from France, 
The servant girls could not keep still, 
The music made them dance. 
John Morgan played the, etc. 
61 
Now one day John he chanced to play 
Outside a 
lady's door, 
And the lady said she never heard 
Such music played before; 
It pleased her so, that you must know, 
She heavy sums would pay 
To John, to stand outside the house, 
And play to her all day. 
John Morgan played the, etc. 
John played upon his instrument, 
And pleased the lady so, 
That when the time arrived to leave, 
She would not let him go. 
She asked if he would marry her, 
Which John did very soon, 
Now on the organ Johnny Morgan 
Plays her many a 
tune.
