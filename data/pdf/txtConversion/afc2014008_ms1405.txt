THE ORPHAN GIRL
 
No home, no home, cried a little girl
 
At the door of a princely hall
 
As she trembling stood on the icy steps
 
And leaned on the marble wall.
 
i
f
ty father, alas, I never knew,
 
He was lost on the ocean bright
 
1
Vr mother sleeps in a new made grave,
 
Tis an orphan who begs tonight.
 
Oh give me a place out of this cold wind
 
A place to lie down, she pled,
 
A pallet in the corner would do for me,
 
But please, just a piece of bread*
 
a
s sung by ALmeda Riddle
 
The rich man shook his haughty head
 
As he shut his mansion door
 
His proud lips curled with scorn as he xsaid,
 
No room and no bread for the poor*
 
I must freeze, she sobbed, as she sank on the steps
 
And tried to cover her feet,
 
With her ragged little dress all tattered and torn
 
And covered with snow and sleet.
 
The rich man lay down on his velvet couch
 
And dreamed about silver and gold,
 
While the little girl lay in the snow on the steps
 
And murmRred, so hungry, so cold.
 
The night rolled on and the midnight chimes
 
Rang out like a funeral knell
 
The earth was wrapped in a winding sheet
 
The blinding snow still fell.
 
The morning dawned and the little girl
 
Lay dead at the rich man's door
 
But her soul had fled to the realms above
 
Where therets room and bread for the poor.
 
The rich man still lay on the velvet couch
 
But his soul, too, had fled,
 
And I don't know where such men go
 
I do know one rich man 's  dead.

Poor little rabbit, cry like a newborn child.
 
I wish I was a headlight on some westbound train
 
(
I'd) shine my light on cool Colorado rain (

I wish I was in cool Colorado, on some mountain high
 
I could see my baby, as she go a—rollin' by.
 
latest sun is sinking fast
 
race is nearly run,
 
strongest trials are now past,
 
triumph has begun.
 
Oh come, angel band .,
 
Come and around me stand
 
Oh bear me away on your snowy wings
 
To my immortal home.  (Repeat last two lines of chorus)
 
I know I
'm nearing the holy ranks
 
Of friends and kindred dear

The crossing must be near.

Who bled and died for me
 
Whose blood now covers

Oh bear my longing heart t

And gives us victory.

LADY MARGARET as sung by
 
Lady Margaret sat at her high hail door
 
Combing back her hair
 
When along came Willie with his new made bride
 
Coming from the church so near, (repeat last line)
 
Well, she threw down her ivory comb
 
Back she tossed her hair
 
And down she fell frczn her high high window
 
No never more did come there.
 
Well day was g
one and night come on
 
And everyone asleep
 
Lady Margaret xrose and stood all alone
 
Weeping at Willie's bed feet.
 
Now how do you like you bed making,
 
And how d
o you like your sheet
 
And how do you like your new true love
 
Lying in your arms asleep
 
Right well do I like my bed making
 
Right well do I like my sheet,
 
But better do I like nr own true love
 
Weeping here at my feet.
 
That a dream I dream a dream as that
 
I fear it means no good,
 
I dreamed my room was full of tears
 
And my bride all drowned in blood.
 
So he called down his waiting men
 
By one, by two, by three,
 
Go ask leave of my new made bride
 
Lady Margaret I might go and see.
 
If you go see your Lady Margaret
 
Pray what becomes of me,
 
I won't be gone but an hour or two
 
Then I
' l
l return to thee.
 
Oh is she in her bowery,
 
Or is she in her hail,
 
Or is she in her chamberie
 
A lady before them all?
 
She is not in her bowerie,
 
Nor is she in her hail,
 
She lies asleep in a cold damp coffin
 
Up against the wall.
 
Irene Kossoy Saletar
i
 
Go open to me that new made coffin
 
Though it be sewn so fine,
 
So I may kiss Lady Margaret '
s lips
 
As often as they kissed mine.
 
Her father opened that coffin lid,
 
Her brother pulled down the sheet,
 
Three times he kissed Lady Margaret's
 
lips,
 
Fell dead right at her feet.
 
Lady Margaret i
s buried in our church
 
yard,
 
And Willie is in the choir
 
And from her grave grew a red red rose
 
And from his a briar.
 
They grew and they grew up the old
 
church tower
 
Will they could grow no higher
 
And there they fell to the cold cold
 
ground
 
And the rose hung round the briar.

Two loving sisters was a-walking s
ide by side
 
Oh the wind and the rain,
 
One pushed the other into the waters deep
 
And she cried, the dreadful wind and rain.
 
The miller fished her out with his long line and hook,
 
Oh the wind and the rain,
 
The miller fished her out from the bottom of the brook
 
And she cried, the dreadful wind and rain.
 
They made fiddle strings out of her long yellow hair,
 
Oh, the wind and the rain,
 
They made fiddle pegs out of her long fingerbones,
 
And she cried, the dreadful wind and rain.

JESSE JAMES as sung by J
Jieda Ri:Icile
 
J
esse James was a lad that  illed many a man
 
He robbed the Danville train
 
And a dirty little coward shot Mister Howard
 
That laid J
esse James in his grave.
 
It was Robert Ford, the dirty little coward,
 
I
 wonder how he feels,
 
For he ate Jesse's bread and he slept in J
esse 1s bed
 
But he laid old Jesse in the grave.
 
Poor J
esse had a wife to mourn for his wife,
 
Three children that were brave,
 
But the dirty little coward that shot'Aster Howard
 
Has laid Jesse James in his grave.
 
It x was with his brother Frank that he robbed the Galatian Bank
 
They carried the money from the town
 
It was at that very place they had a little chase
 
For they shot old Captain Sheets to the ground.
 
They went to the crossing not very far from there
 
There, they did the same,
 
With the agent on his knees he delivered up the keys
 
To the outlaws, Frank and Jesse J
ames.
 
1
 
It was on a Wednesday night, and not a star was
 
They robbed the Glendale train
 
The people they did say for many miles away
 
It was robbed by Frank and J
esse James,
 
It was on a Saturday night and Jesse was at home
 
Just talking with his family brave,
 
Robert Ford came along like a thief in
 
And he laid J
esse James in the grave*
 
the night
 
in sight
 
The people held their breath when they heard of J
esse's death
 
And wondered how he came to die,
 
It was one of his own gang, called little Robert Ford,
 
Who shot Jesse James on the sly.
 
This song was made by Milly S. Slade
 
As soon as the news did arrive,
 
Who said, there's no man with the law in his hand
 
Could take old J
esse James while alive.

Farther Along
 
Tempted and tried, we're all made to wonder
 
why it should be thus, all the day long
 
While there are others living about us
 
Never molested,  though in the wrong
 
Cho.
 
Farther along we'll know all abcut it
 
Farther along we'll understand why
 
Cheer up my brothers, live in the sunshine
 
You'll understand it all by and by
 
When death has come and taken our loved ones
 
Leaving our home so lonely and drear
 
Then do we wonder, why others prosper
 
Living so wicked, year after year.
 
When we see Jesus coming in glory
 
When he comes from his home in the sky
 
Thenhe shall bid us to that bright mansion
 
We'll understand it all by and by.
 
Verse L of Sing to the power of the Lord
 
Amazing graces how sweet the sound,
 
That saved a wretch like me
 
I once was lost, but now I m  found,
 
Was blind but now I see.

ay up in the  Sierra Pea s,  wher  the ye l

Rusty Jigga and Sandy Sam  had a rodeo c

And they made a Vow to brand each cow  that came within their view.

They s

And they ended up at the Depot House,  s
ome forty-odd drinks below.
 
A S  they were a-ridin' on back to the camp, a-packin' a pretty good i

0ar1y in the morning,
 
In the chilly light of dawn,
 
My alarm clock wakes me up
 a
 
And I put my work clothes on
 
And I go strolling through th& orchard
 
Down to the cutting shed,
 
And you can bet your dog-gone life
 
That I
'd rather be in bed asleep,
 
I
'd rather be in bed.

If every apricot I see 
C

Would change into a dime for me,
 
I
ly worries would be over then;
 
I
'd never have to work again.
 
The men with pails and ladders
 
Go quickly through the trees.
 
Their voices singing as they work
 
Float along the summer breeze
 
And yet the sun keeps getting hotter,
 
The morning's work is slowed,
 
Just when we think we'll take a rest
 
They bring in another load, oh yes,
 
They bring  another load.
 
If every anriect I see
 
Would change into a dime for me,
 
My worries would be over then;
 
I'd never have to work again.
 
The noon-day whistle tells us
 
It's time to stop and eat.
 
We sit beneath a shady tree
 
Gee,
 good to rest our feet
 
And munch on beans and cold tortillas
 
Or sometimes bread and cheese,
 
And If we're hungry for dessert
 
We just pick it off the trees, big treat
 
We pick it off the trees.
 
If every apricot I see
 
Would change into a dime for me,
 
l
:y worries would be over then;
 
I
'd never have to work again.
 
The smell of fruit a-drying
 
Draws bumble-bees and flies.
 
The sulphur smoke may kill the germs
 
But it darn near blinds our eyes
 
But not so we can't see the foreman
 
As he goes passing through.
 
he holler,  "Foreman, punch our cards
 
And that's all we want from you,  yes sin
 
all we want from  r

And the boss hands out our pay,

I Couldn't Refuse, I Couldn
 Resist Equality.
 
I remember way back yander, a hunJro
 yenrn or  ore,
 
When a poor man went to a rich man's house
 
He went to his back door.
 
Then fi htin' Andrew Jackson, came out -n j
:1' n ssec
 
He hobbled the big rich man, and sst the n
c r :
,an iron,
 
And what'd that do to me.???
 
Chorus
 
I couldn't refuse, I couldn't resist Equality,
 
I couldn't keep from shoutin' for the country of the free,
 
When Andrew Jackson invited me to the White Iouse for a spree,
 
I wouldn't refuse, I couldn't resist equality, oh no
 
I couldn't refuse, I couldn't resist equality.
 
I loved a rich man s
 daughter, & I guess she loved me more.
 
But her father said we could not wed because I was so poor,
 
So I up and run for Congress, and went to Washington,
 
And now her durned old daddy hangs around and calls no son
 
I wish I had my gun.
 
I couldn't refuse I couldn't resist equality,
 
I say a man is just a man wherever he may be,
 
When they set me a dinner with the aristocracy
 
I couldn't refuse I couldn't resist equality, 10
 
I couldn't refuse, I c
ouldnft resist equality.
 
Old Hick'ry had a message for a British Viceroy,
 
And the man he sent to London was that old Bear—hunter's boy,

My Church is under the tree,

The land of my church is as wide as
 
Bound only by cloud and by sky,
 
It's flag of true justice is always
 
Where tolerance never shall die.
 
The roll of my church is all colors

That makes you a brother of mine.

Your name e

Your name i

You are the one that 1

If I ever prove false to you my love, bright day will turn to night
 
Bright day will turn to night my love, the elements will turn,
 
The fire will freeze and bG no more, & the raging sea will burn.

One night he went out with his new-found fri nds
 
And th

They tey oted,hjm and tempted him, but he refus 1
 
until
 he took a glass of beer.

Uhen h9 seen v

while i

And cruelly he broke her tambourine.

And c me to the city to seek employment;
 
She hd to

t
nd her father had fallen down and hurt his knee.
 
Just before she went away her sweetheart, whose name was T-c
ic
 
Said to h4
'r, "I fear you will not be true" /
 
And so, she had to promise him before she got on the tein
 
That every ni,ght at eight o
'clock she would burst into te rs.
 
/
 
She came ,
to the city and was riding on E
y street cur
 
When a r n got uo and offered her his seat /
 
She refuseji the offer with scorn, for she saw thut Le
ooe
 
And she didn't know but that he might be a married man.
 
Then ip came the conductor and said, "I knew,you would be true"
