The Tinware Man
THE TIN WARE MAN 5126 A1
Sherman Loop Visalia, 1941
Come all you white folks A story I will tell 'Twas all about a pretty little girl In New York she
did dwell. Her father he sold apples On a Union ferry boat, Her mother made a fortune By
patching up old coats.
O she's gone far away I never shall see her no more She ran away with a tin-ware man
To Jersey's foreign shore - O she's gone far away I never shall see her no more She ran
away with a tin-ware man To Jersey's foreign shore.
My girl invented popcorn And that within good style Her sweet melodious voice could be
heard For over half a mile 'Twas there she met that Tin-ware man I wish he'd never been
born He asked her for to let him have Three cents worth of popcorn.
O she's gone far away I never shall see her no more She ran away with a tin-ware man
To Jersey's foreign shore - O she's gone far away I never shall see her no more She ran
away with a tin-ware man To Jersey's foreign shore.
I'm a-goin' to get me a musket And a keg of powder too And a great big knife and a pistu-
el And I'll hunt all Jersey through - If ever I Find that Tin-ware man He'll peddle his tin no
more I'll start another new graveyard On Jersey's foreign shore.
