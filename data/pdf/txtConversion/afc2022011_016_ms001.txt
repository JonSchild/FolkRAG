00:01 Question 1 
1.   Thinking back, what are your very earliest memories of, or about, weaving? 
A. Ulithian:  Hobe luluwal tefal ngo mada mele hochil mem’mangi hare gulayem mo irel yam 
la Kai mo gula doh deur? 
Interviewee in Ulithian:

Interviewee in English: 
When I began to understand the weaving process, I saw the 
ladies scraping the banana strips torn from banana bark 
layers. During this time, people were using commercial thread, 
but more people were still using local fibers.  We usually got 
the leftover bark of the banana, which they already tore the 
strips from, and we would dry them and use them to make our 
mini weavings. That’s how we started learning how to weave. 
 
Interviewer in Ulithian:

Interviewer in English:

Interviewee in English: 
Yes, we would learn by playing. We also made weavings from 
coconut leaves. That is what little girls used for play weaving, 
but that’s how we started to learn to weave. But as for myself, I 
started learning from watching people and learning from what 
they told me. I would get nails and nail them into a piece of 
board, and I would use that as my warping board. The ladies 
would tell me what to do, then I would do it.

Interviewee in English: 
For myself, I started learning from my parents. I moved to 
Falalop Island with my grandparents, and Laigtawas, the wife 
of my uncle Yichog, taught me how to weave. I learned how to 
warp the string on the Woleaian warping board first. Woleaian 
warping boards have 5 pegs, while Ulithian warping boards 
have only 4 pegs. My grandfather made a small loom and a 
small warping board for me, so I learned how to weave. When 
I reached womanhood, Laigtawas made me weave on the 
regular loom, and I learned from her. So, I started warping and 
weaving. 
 
04:02 Question 2 
2.   In your mind, who is the one person you most associate with weaving in your life and 
why? 
A. Ulithian:  Lol yam luluwal, itei semal le ye kael yam fel ngali irel yam fefaru doh deur hare

ngo yela m’moch yai dedeur le yiy mele ye haskuna ngalyei 
 
Interviewee in English: 
The one person I was close to when weaving was Laigtawas.  I 
learned from my grandmother first, but it was Laigtawas who 
taught me weaving after my grandmother and made me get 
into the weaving routine. 
 
Interviewee in Ulithian: 
04:45 Itei imala Laigtawas?

Interviewer in English: 
Who is Laigtawas? 
 
Interviewee in Ulithian: 
04:48 Ahh… semal ahhh, semal remradah, semal re Wolai, ila

Interviewee in English: 
She is from Woleai. She is the wife of Yichog. 
 
Interviewee in Ulithian: 
04:56 Defam iy Yichog? 
 
Interviewer in English: 
How is Yichog related to you? 
 
Interviewee in Ulithian:

Interviewee in English: 
Yichog is… 
 
Interviewer in Ulithian:

Interviewer in English:

Interviewee in Ulithian: 
05:02 Ngo yai uncle. Bo Makala wulyetigil mele rehasiyei bo

Interviewee in English: 
Yes, my uncle, because his parents adopted me. 
 
Interviewer in Ulithian: 
05:07 Iwe hosa hachigchig bo isa madaf. 
 
Interviewer in English:

Interviewee in English: 
So, she was the one who taught me the details of how to warp 
the thread, and how to weave.  When I made mistakes, she did 
not laugh at me or scold me, but she took her time and 
patiently showed me how to fix the problem. For one style of 
lavalava called peig, which is usually woven by the Woleaians, 
she told me I had to learn how to make it before she would 
give me one to wear. So, she taught me how to make the peig 
4 
 
pattern and how to make the designs at the ends of the 
lavalava. The first peig I wore was woven by us, together. 
 
Interviewer in Ulithian: 
06:17 Ila fal le ye kal yam felngali iyang? 
 
Interviewer in Ulithian: 
So, that’s why you associate weaving with her? 
 
Interviewee in Ulithian:

Interviewee in English: 
Yes. So, ladies would get together to weave. One time, the 
ladies got together and made warps and wove, but I didn’t feel 
close to any of those ladies like I was to her. Yes, Meek, Clary, 
and I wove together, but we were just weaving together. 
 
 
07:17 Question 3 
3.   Why is weaving so important to you? 
A.   Ulithi: Mada mele dedeur ye kael yal palengpelal ngalug iyang?

Interviewee in English: 
It’s very important to learn how to weave because lavalava is 
very essential in our culture. If you have daughters, it’s a must 
that she should have the tools for weaving and know how to 
weave. When there’s a death, it’s a must that you should give 
lavalava.  If you made some mischief in the community or to 
5 
 
another family, you need to give lavalava to beg for 
forgiveness and peace. Lavalava is something that we use for 
almost everything. It’s a woman’s responsibility to teach her 
daughter how to weave because it’s not good for her to not 
know how to weave. 
 
09:15  Question 4 
4.   How has weaving or woven skirts changed over your lifetime, or since the lifetime of 
those who taught you?

Interviewee in English: 
There have been so many changes in weaving that I see these 
days. In the old days, our weavings were only black and white 
because we didn’t have that many colors. Using the few colors 
we did have, we would try to make our thread lavalavas the 
same style as the local ones. A man’s lavalava is different than 
a woman’s lavalava.  Deur/gow style lavalava has to be 7 “gur” 
6 
 
(wider background stripes) and 6 “pad” (narrower contrasting 
stripes), but these days, they make their lavalava with  11 “gur” 
and 10 “pad”. And, the “gur” has to be a dark color and the 
“pad” has to be a lighter color.  Nowadays, some people switch 
the colors.  They use the lighter color for the “gur” and darker 
colors for the “pad”. How we wear lavalava has also changed a 
lot. There’s a certain width that a lavalava must be in order to 
wear it. It cannot be too short or too wide. The width should be 
enough that it falls over your knees when worn. A lavalava 
made from thread should be like one that uses local colors and 
patterns if it is to be worn. Nowadays, people make lavalava 
that go down almost to their ankles. They look more like long 
dresses.There are also some weavings now that look like the 
weavers used more supplemental warp pattern sticks that 
make that part of the weaving look different, more like a woven 
basket or mat. 
 
Interviewer in Ulithian: 
12:59 Rarel padal? 
 
Interviewer in Ulithian:

Interviewee in English: 
Yes. And the thin stripe is more like basket weaving. It’s like 
they used a lot of supplemental warp patterning sticks. I have 
seen lavalava with those patterns, but I have not seen how 
they are woven.  
 
Interviewer in Ulithian: 
13:20 Cholop dib iyang? 
 
Interviewer in Ulithian: 
So, they used a lot of pattern sticks?

Interviewee in English: 
Yes.  That’s how they say they do it, but I have not seen it 
done. I don’t know where it started from. They also do another 
way of warping that is different from how it’s normally done, 
and they call it “yochap”.  It’s a big change in weaving.  I think 
people are too smart, and they come up with different ways to 
weave. In the old days, only a few people knew how to fix the 
warp if something went wrong during weaving, like if the 
heddle rod fell out, or if another part of the loom was pulled out 
while weaving. You would have to look for these ladies and 
beg them or their families to fix your weaving. Nowadays, it’s 
not a problem anymore. Anybody can fix whatever problem 
that they have while weaving. 
 
 
15:53 Question 5  
5.    If you could talk to your great-granddaughter about weaving, what would you want to tell 
her?

Interviewee in English: 
I would tell my great-granddaughters to try and learn how to 
weave because it’s something that is very essential in our 
culture. We must teach our daughters how to weave because it 
is our culture. We look bad if we don’t teach our daughters how 
to weave. Some are like, how do we say? 
 
Interviewee in Ulithian:

Interviewee in Ulithian: 
17:34 Tapel mulwe resa luluwal wei chog irel meka milel

about our culture.

17:39 Ngo... ngo te, si need sibe gula hare, irel le bla wel doh

Interviewer in English: 
Yes. And we need to know how to weave in case something 
happens, and then we will have something to use if there is an 
issue. So, it’s important for them to know how to weave, right? 
 
Interviewee in Ulithian:

Interviewee in English: 
Yes, it’s very essential to have lalvalava available. Like I said 
earlier, we use it for almost everything, and that’s why it’s very 
important to teach our daughters and our great- 
granddaughters. I wouldn’t want other people to have to weave 
for my great- granddaughter because she doesn’t know how to 
weave her own clothing.
