ANY TINWARE TO MEND. 
Composed and sung by JOHNNY' ROACH. 
Anti—" Down Among the Coals." 
Good people all give ear to me, I'll tell you who I 
am, 
And if you listen to my song I'll amuse ye if I 
can. 
I 
am a 
traveling tinker as you can plainly see, 
Perhaps there's some one here that has a 
job for me. 
CHORUS. 
Any tinware to mend, any tinware to mend, 
I'm tile boy can mend your pans, your pots, your kitties, 
and your cans ; 
Any tinware to mend, any tinware to mend, 
They call me roving Irish Jack the tinker. 
They told me when I 
left the old dart, it's some time now, 
of course, 
A rolling stone where e'er it goes it seldom gathers moss. 
But I 
inn one that's not too fast, I 
never go too soon, 
For I 
belong to Butler's club and keep one eye on silver 
spoons. 
Any tinware to mend, &e. 
And if a 
pretty girl I 
meet, why the question then I 
pop,e 
She is sure to bring her pots and pans the holes for me to 
stop. 
And if the mistress does come down to find out what the 
bother, 
I 
never fail to use on her some of the same soft soder. 
Any tinware to mend, &e.

THE REFORMER ON THE SLY. 
Revised and Sung by JoHNNY RoActi with great success. 
'Good people all, take my advice, and listen unto me, 
But don't put too much confidence in every man you see, 
They say, fine feathers make fine birds, but not so every one, 
For men will often wear broadcloth, to hide their little game, 
But whether they are fish or fowl it makes no difference to 
I 
know my business, you can bet, I'm a 
ref Tmer on the sly. 
There are fifty kinds of swindling-mills in the papers every day, 
And lotteries where you dra v 
a 
farm ,God knows how far away.) 
'There's pliticians now- a- days that at public expense, 
They rob our city government and leave it not worth a 
cent, 
I 
wish for once I 
was a 
Judge, and had those thieves to try, 
They'd get sent up and polished off, by a 
reformer on the sly_ 
'There's Madam Morris, from Corsica, who with her telescope, 
Your futiree wife or husband shows. 
Good gracious that's a 
joke, 
If you give to her hut fifty cents, she'll send you a 
card by mail, 
I 
think they ought to find her a 
imme, six months in the county 
jaiL 
There's the seventh daughter of the seventh son to swindle yon. 
they'll try, 
But I 
know their little euchre game, I'm a 
reformer on the sly. 
In Chatham street, the other day I 
took a 
walk along, 
I 
heard a 
fellow crying out, ping, goin;, gone-
b'd3 for it, this fine gaLl watch, the finest ever seen, 
The thought I 
was a 
little 
erhaps a 
little green— 
I 
says, excuse me, please, if I 
wink so with my eye, 
I 
know my business, you can bet, I'm a 
reformer on the sly.

GIVE A MAN A CHANCE. 
Words and Music by J. 
Batchelder. 
I'm tied of offering advice, 
So will the subject change, 
And try a 
song of different stamp, 
A title far from strange; 
So, while I 
strive to do my best, 
At me pray take a 
glance, 
Just lend your sympathizing ears, 
And give a 
man a 
chance. 
So always, boys, act fair and square, 
Accept what fortune grants, 
And don't be over critical, 
But give a 
man a 
chance. 
It's anything but proper, 
On a 
couple to intrude, 
To spoil a 
Yellow making love, 
is very, very rude ; 
Don't interrupt their tete-a-tete, 
By making an advance, 
But walk a 
mile another way, 
And give a 
man a 
chance. 
So always, boys, etc. 
Suppose a 
fellow can't stump up 
Twenty shillings in the pound, 
Perhaps if breathing time be given, 
The needful will be found ; 
Say to lii iii ," 
Well, ill wait a 
bit," 
Think of this circumstance ; 
And if you don't press over hard, 
You give a 
man a 
chance. 
So always, boys, eta. 
My song perhaps, may net please you, 
But to do so is my aim ; 
To meet your kind approval is 
The summit of my tame ; 
But if you do not quite agree 
-With what I 
now advance, 
Just be as lenient as you can, 
And give a 
man a 
chance. 
So always, boys, act fair and square, 
Accept what fortune grants, 
And don't be over critical, 
But give a 
man a

THE COT IN THE CORNER,. 
POOR OLD lancr, 
I 
was rea -ed in Doncaster, 
Some forty years ago ; 
But times are very different 
As many of you know. 
I've had my slime of sunshine, 
Of cours, I 
can't complain,. 
But the goo .I old days have passed away', 
And they'll never come again. 
Poor old Mike. 
CIIORts. 
But now I'm growing old, 
And my age it does decay; 
A poor old worn out stableman, 
Every ono does say. 
Pour o.d Mike I 
poor old Mike! 
When I 
was rising six years old, 
They first put me across, 
One of Lord Derby's favorites, 
For a 
trial round the course. 
So firm and neat I 
kept my seat, 
The knowing ones they stared. 
As I 
rattled in from a 
two mile spin, 
Every one declared— 
'Twas clever little Mike. 
But now, &c:.. 
Then I 
was made a 
jockey, 
t 
suited well my taste; 
A handy chap at a 
handicap, 
Smart at a 
steeple chase. 
East. west, north or south, 
I ,o1.i show an open thee; 
For I 
always acted on the square, 
And never sold a 
race-. 
Monest little Alike! 
But now, 
But soon I 
grew too big, 
I 
could neither ' train' or ' waste;' 
My patrons, too. they died, 
So I 
was sacked in haste, 
But posting days were in their prime, 
A post-hack I 
bestrode; 
With a 
smack, Ya hip!' crack goes the whip, 
Rattling down the road. 
Poor old Alike! 
But now, Sz.c;. 
But steam • oon run us off the road, 
And rheumat is set in ;

Sung by Wm 
F. SINCLAIR LAW Lou, in the laughable sketch of Barney. 
and the Ghost, as performuil by CHAS. M AC .EVOY'S original 
Hibernicon Troupe. 
OCh lone, wirrastrew, how hard is our lot, 
The landlord has turned us out of our cot, 
To us in this world ' twas the happiest spot, 
On the hill- side, beyant in the corner ; 
The roof was thatched over with bright yellow straw, 
And the walls were as whie as the snowflake agra, 
Oh it was a 
fine picture a 
painter might draw, 
From the boreen beyant in the corner. 
It was putty without, it was tidy within, 
On the shelves, shone like silver, our plate made of ti. 
Which east sonic reflections when sunlight stole in, 
On the dog and the eat in the corner ; 
Of bacon, galore, we had many a 
flitch in 
The wide mouthed chimney, that yawned in the kitchen, 
Oh '
twould make your month water, and eager to pitch in 
To the hames that hung high in the corner. 
And there by the fire my mother would knit, 
And close to her side my.ould father would sit, 
What stories he'd tell when his dudeen was lit, 
While he smoked away in the corner; 
When supper was over the neighbors dropped in, 
And by the turf fire each roasted his shin, 
While the boys and the girls ne'er thought it a 
da 
For to hug and to kiss in the corner. 
When Jimm y the piper walked in on the floor, 
The young people all made a 
rush for the door, 
Dragging Jimmy along to the barn, and sure 
They placed him high up in the curlier ; 
Then at it they went dear with hearts light and gay, 
And danced the night hours into the young day, 
'Till Jimmy got drunk an' no longer could play, 
For he lay pipes and all in the corner. -

THE CYMBAL MAN. 
I'm going to tell the public the way that I've been served, 
And when they hear my story they'll know what makes me so 
unnerved. 
'Twas a 
girl called Mary, whom I 
loved—she promised me her 
heart and band, 
But she left me for a 
fellow whom she thought was much more 
grand, 
'Cause he played upon the Cymbals in a 
military Band. 
ei3onus. 
Cling, clang, the Cymbals went, the Cymbals went, 
Didn't he think himself a 
gent, as he marched in the middle of 
the Baud. 
I 
dropped in quite promiscuously to take a 
cup of tea, 
It was earlier than usual, I 
dtre say half past three, 
I 
was eating of a 
muffin, v 
N 
hen my girl held up her band, 
And says, my dear, now don't you hear, a 
military Band, 
Don't you see that darling fellow there, oh, don t 
he look quite 
grand. 
Cling, clang, & c. 
You can judge of my astonishment to hear her talking thus.; 
And of that beastly Cymbal fellow making. such a 
fuss, 
Mary, I 
exclaimed, with jealous rage, which I 
could scarce with-
stand, 
l'm sorry you take such interest in a 
military Band, 
'Cause fellows dressed in uniforms you always think looks grand. 
Cling, clang, ite. 
For a 
while I 
had to leave her, in the countr:,- I'd a 
job, 
I 
little thought that any one, my happiness would rob. 
When I 
returned and heard the news why I 
could scarcely stand, 
She skedaldlet1 with that Cymbal man, who she thought looked 
so grand, 
But I'll smash his Cymbals on his bead when I 
catch him in his 
Dana, 
Cling, clan, fko.

FONTENOY. 
As Sung by JOHNNY Roam 
0 ! have you heard the news, my boys, 
That glorious news to- day ; 
Those gallant sons, with pikes and guns, 
Are girding for the fray. 
The exiles are returning. 
Their dear old land to see ; 
And you and me, must ready be, 
To strike for Ilberty. 
We'll tear that British banner down, 
And well every foe destroy; 
Till we trample in the bloody dust 
Of an Irish Fontenoy. 
The green flag shall wave over us, 
As it did in days of yore ; 
And t'!e dear old harp of Tara's Hall, 
Shall strike its chords once more. 
And the tune we'll play, shall be Patrick's day 
And we'll play it o'er and o'er, 
And soon you'll see, old Ireland free, 
And the exiles home once more 
We'll tear, tte. 
We have begged of Englana Long, my boys, 
But now we'll beg no more ; 
No more like prowling hounds we'll crawl, 
Around our master's door. 
We have learned the way to freedom, boys, 
And soon well strike the blow ; 
That will raise up poor old Ireland, 
And lay the tyrant low. 
We'll tear, cbc. •

Don't imagine yotil meet with a

THAT'S WHERE YOU MATKE.— [CoscLuDED.] 
Do not fancy you'll meet with a 
cabby, 
Who more than his fare will not take, 
May as well think an oyster could crawl up a 
tree, 
And there you would make a 
mistake. 
If you fancy a 
girl dislikes a 
small kiss, 
You must be—what some folks call—a 
cake: 
If you think your collector of taxes won't call, 
That's where you make the mistake. 
Don't imagine a 
man has no coin in his purse, 
Because he's not dress'd as a " swell," 
A book with a 
cover that's olden and worn 
Has often a 
good tale to tell. 
You'll oft see a 
swell, all collar, and cuffs 
To his finger-tips, white as snow-flake, 
But if you believe he's all over alike, 
That's where you make the mistake. 
The ladies still wear an abundance of hair, 
'Tis a 
wonder their dear necks don't break, 
But if you imagine they grow it themselves, 
That's where you make the mistake. 
When courting, don't write spooney letters 
To your fair one, for love, nor for sport, 
For should you but break any promise, 
They are sure to be read out in court. 
When you wed, do not marry the famly as well, 
For that will not a 
paradise make; 
Above all, close the door to your mother-in-law, 
Or—that's where you'll make the mistake. 
But—talking of marriage—reminds me, 
We've given the Germans a 
shake: 
They fancied Louise and her cash was for them, 
That's where they made the mistake. 
Don't imagine your milk is not " doctored," 
Nor quite pure is your two-shilling tea, 
Don't imagine it's awfully jolly, 
The first time you go on the sea. 
Don't reckon your chicks before hatched, or 
Your duck may p'rhaps turn out a 
drake, 
Don't go and eat mustard, and fancy it's jam, 
Or that's where you'll make the mistake. 
With all the advice I 
have given, 
You ought to be well wide-awake, 
And should you imagine I'll sing any more, 
That's where you make the mistake.

BOURBON ON THE BRAIN. 
A 
Parody on " Just Before the Battle, Mother.* 
Just before the battle, mother, (hic) 
I 
was thinking least of you, 
While upon the field we're spreeing, (hic) 
With the enemy in view. 
Comrades ( hic) drunk around me lying, 
Filled with bitters made by Dod, 
For well they know that on the morrow 
Some will lie drunk on (hic) the sod. 
CHORUS. 
Farewell, mother, you may never, (
hie) never 
See me sober home again; 
But, oh 1 
you'll not forget me, mother, 
If dead with " Bourbon on the brain." 
Oh, I 
long to have, dear mother, 
A demijohn sent me from home ; (hic) 
First thing at morn I 
like my bitters, 
Ere to picket post (hic) I 
roam. 
Tell the traitors all around you, 
That ( hic) their cruel deeds, we know, 
In every instance, kill our soldiers 
With their stuff called " Kill (hie) me slow." 
Farewell, mother, ese. 
Hark, I 
hear the fish-horn sounding, 
'Tis the signal ( hie) for a 
muss; 
May I 
get no bruises, mother, (hie) 
As 1 
join into this fuss. 
Hear the battle- cry of (hic) Bourbon, 
how it swells upon the air ; 
Oh, yes, I'll rally round the bottle, 
And get blind drunk (hic) while I 
am there. 
Farewell, mother, (te. 
t‘ ERIN MY COUNTRY." 
Oh ! 
Erin my country, though strangers may roam 
Thy hills and thy mountains I 
once called my own : 
Thy lakes and thy valleys no longer I 
see, 
But warmly as ever my heart beats for thee. 
CIIORUS. 
Oh ! " Cushla Machree " my heart beats for thee, 
Erin ! Erin ! my heart beats for thee. 
Long years have passed o'er us since last time we met, 
But lived I 
a 
thousand I 
could not forget: 
The warm heart that loved me, 
The bright eyes that shone 
Like stars in the heaven of days that are gone. 
CHORUS. 
Oh! " Cushla Machree " my heart beats for thee, 
Erin! Erin! my heart beats for thee. 
Dear home of my youth, I 
shall ne'er see thee more, 
But memory treasures the bright days of yore : 
And my heart's latest wish the last sigh of my breast 
Shall be for thee, dear home, the land of the west. 
Oh ! " Cushla Machree" my heart beats for thee, 
Erin! Erin! my heart beats for tLee.

COSTERMONGER JOE. 
As sung by JOHNNY BoAm with great success. 
I'm Costermonger Joe, and as my rounds I 
go, 
For many a 
mile the girls all smile en Costermonger Joe. 
With mind devoid of care, and spirits light as air, 
I 
whistle and sing, and cabbages bring from Centre Market, oh. 
I 
started young in trade, and a 
nice connection made 
Along the streets, the avenues and squares. 
Now all I 
have to do is. call a 
thing or two, 
While " Ned," my little donkey, draws my wares, draws my wares— 
While Ned, my little donkey, draws my wares. 
CHORUS. 
Pm Costermongcr Joe, and as my rounds I 
go, 
For many a 
mile the girls all smile on t..ostermonger Joe. 
I'm Costermone.er Joe— no money do I 
owe: 
There's not a 
crust that's got on trust by Costermonger Joe, 
And yet to barely live, why, I 
must credit give, 
Or none would deal or grease the wheel for Costermonger Joe. 
It's not the likes of me yea in the paper see, 
Petitioning the court for a 
divorce ; 
But those who can almost a 
college education boast. 
So morality by learning loses force, loses fo rce— 
So morality by learning loses twee. 
I'm Costermonger Joe. & c. 
I'm Costermonger Joe, and steadily I 
row 
The stream of life, but wants a 
wife, does Costermonger Joe, 
His humble lot to share. 
Let her be dark or fair, 
szhell be always sure of affection pure from Costermonger Joe. 
How happy would I 
be in summer after tea, 
To drive my little Nrife around about, 
In the green lanes in my cart, with feelings proud at heart 
That I 
could own what I 
was driving out, driving out— 
That I 
could own what I 
was driving out. 
I'm Costermonger Joe, & c. 
I'm Costermonger Joe, and I 
would have on know 
All are not fools from ragged schools, says Costermonger Joe ; 
For it's there I 
first began to learn that every man 
his mind must give to work., and live like Costermonger Joe. 
I've told you all toy mind in hopes that I 
should find: 
So, folks, to own the ronehest may be true, 
And beneath the humble corduroy lie hearts that beat with joy— 
So respectfully I 
bid you all adieu, adieu— 
So respectfully I 
bid you all adieu. 
Costormonger JO', & C. 
PARODY ON TWENTY YEARS AGO. 
I 
wandered by the village, Tom-
1 
sat beneath the tree ; 
And gazed upon that dear old jail, 
That oft sheltered you and me. 
But none was there to bail me out, 
At least they told me so; 
I 
was not acquainted with the judge, 
Like twenty years ago. 
The jail is altered some, dear Tom, 
It's larger now than then ; 
It's cells are twice as wide, dear Tom, 
To accommodate more men. 
The bell is there that used to ring, 
When to work we had to go ; 
The music's just as sweet, dear Tom 
As twenty years ago. 
The boys are at the same old game, 
Of hooking on the sly ; 
They stole a 
ham the other night, 
'Twits oft done by you and 1. 
They're gambling, too, for money, Tom, 
At seven-up, you know ; 
That good old game we loved so well 
Just twenty years ago. 
Down by the spring, close to the elm, 
You know poor William Way ; 
I 
mean the old shoemaker, Tom, 
I 
saw him yesterday. 
Some wretch has kicked his stuffing out, 
He's dying, sure but slow ; 
Just as the one you wolloped so, 
Died twenty years ago. 
My lids have long been dry, dear Tom, 
But tears came to my eyes ; 
When 1 
think upon that good old hash 
And those dear old mutton pies. 
went into Peet's to get a 
drink, 
But, Tom, I 
started so, 
I 
had narry red- 1 
was dead broke-
Like tweaty years ago.

64 THE SPADE." 
21 
THE FELLOW THAT PLAYED THE BANJO. 
Give rue the Spade and the man who can use it ; 
A fig for your lord, and his soft silken hands, 
Let the man who has strength never stoop to abuse it, 
Give back to the giver—the land, boys, the land. 
There's no bank like the Earth to deposit your labor, 
The more you deposit the more you shall have ; 
If there's more than you want you can give to your neigh-
bor, 
And your name shall be dear to the true and the brave. 
CHORUS. 
Give me the Spade, &-,
c. 
Give me the Spade—the American's glory— 
That fashions the field from the bleak barren moor, 
Let us speak of its praise in ballad and story, 
While ' tis brightened with labor, not tarnished with 
gore. 
It was not the Sword that won our best battles, 
Create I 
our Commerce, extended our Trade, 
Gave food for our wives, our children, our cattle, 
But the Queen of all weapons—the Spade, boys, the 
Spade. 
Give me the Spade, &c. 
Give me the Spade, there's a 
magic about it, 
That turns the black soil into bright shining gold, 
What would our fathers have done. boys, without, 
When this land lay all bare and the north wind blew 
cold. 
Where the tall forests stood, and the wild beasts were yell-
ing, 
Where out stout-hearted ancestors shrank back afraid— 
Now the cornstack is raised and have cleared a 
dwelliwz. 
Then hurrah for our true friend, the Spade. boys, the 
Spade. 
Give me the Spade, S5c. 
I 
dare say yon think now that strange it appears, 
To see a 
comedian who is nearly in tears; 
But when my sad story I 
pour in your ears, 
Perhaps you will pity my Woes. 
It's on a 
young damsel I 
fondly did doat— 
NO 
charmer more fairer than she. 
She fancied the stage, but cool 
not sing a 
note, 
So she came to take lessons from me— do, re, mi. 
0101tUS. 
To music halls nightly this damsel would go, 
And listen to Robinson, who enchanted her so ; 
But now she's got married, and lives in a 
place I 
don't know, 
With a 
fedow who plays the banjo. 
On hearing me sing the " Bohemian Swell," 
She head-,ver-ears in love with me fell. 
In less than three weeks she knew all her notes well, 
Such attention I 
to her bad paid. 
All the new- ladies' songs that were published I 
bought; 
I 
bought her stage properties new : 
For she by this time to perfection was brought, 
And soon was to make her debut. 
To music halls nightly, Ice. 
Now. I 
asked a 
young fellow I 
happened to know, 
lie being rather clever 'loon tho banjo; 
And as I 
to the country for a 
week bad to go, 
To perfOrm my to W11 dii us for toe. 
He promised, and I 
on my journey did start— 
Came back, and found to toy dismay, 
That he with his banjo had Si) charmed her heart, 
That with Lim she :skedaddled away. 
To music halls nightly, &c. 
I 
ne'er saw her more after that night— 
ne'er sow her more, though I 
SVP.telwd left and right. 
And I 
was laid up seven weeks through the flight, 
The news it so played on my oerves 
As I 
was out strolliipz one very line day, 
I 
turned round to hear music tones. 
Saw this chap with his banjo was tutting away, 
While my darling was sit:II:ill! , the 
hones " 
To music halls nightly, &c. 
Against this yoang fellow a !,-rmige T 
do owe— 
Ile did very wrong in servint , no, so ; 
And also it grudge agains4t his haojo— 
And I 
hope it won't teep in tune. 
I 
hope, who he plays. 1 
ha' t 
he bridge will break down 
And knock a

Ana I 
also hope. when they go through the town, 
That they don't get one cent of tin.

KATE O'LEARY. 
Don't talk to me of your Broadway swells, 
Nor rave about your Bowery belles, 
I'll tell you of the best of girls, 
A country little fairy. 
I'll sing to you of a 
girl I 
knew, 
She lived in Huntingdon. it's true : 
And if you listen you'll find there were mighty few 
Could equal Kate O'Leary. 
CHORUS. 
For she is just the girl you'd like to spark; 
Her eyes are blue and her hair is dark; 
Not from the Battery to Central Park 
Could you equal Kate O'Leary. 
Her cheeks were red, and her eyes were blue; 
Her hair was dark, of the deepest hue ; 
Her foot was small and neat to view, 
And her heart was light and airy. 
Her voice was music to my ear ; 
She had an Irish brogue, so rich and clear : 
The like again 
never hear 
As from sweet Kate O'Leary. 
For she's just, &c. 
Although she had no 
Grecian Bend," 
She had the hearts of all the men. 
For invitations they NVOldd send, 
For she danced just like a 
fairy. 
She was none too short, nor yet too tall— 
She had no " ChignOn " nor 
Waterfall ;" 
But faith the belle of any ball 
Was my charming Kate O'Leary. 
For she's just, &e.

As snug by JOHNNY ROACH. 
Once I 
was a 
waterman and lived at home at ease, 
But now I 
am a 'mutineer and plow the raging seas ; 
I 
thought I'd like a 
sea-taming life to visit lands afar, 
So I 
sailed awsy from Calico Bay on board the Panama. 
cnouus. 
Then heave away my hearties we're bound for lands afar, 
As we sailed away from Calico Bay on board the Panama. 
Our ship she lay at anchor, in the fain'd Jersey canal, 
She was a 
great and noble ship, describe her now I 
shall ; 
Her cabin was on her second deck, through a 
ladder down 
the hole. 
And we were bound for Wigan, me boys, to get a 
big load 
of coal. 
Then heave away, &c. 
Our captain was a 
sturdy man, he stood just six feet three, 
His hair was red, his eyes were green, and his mouth as 
big as three; 
He could beat the world at drinking grog, you might 
search both near and far, 
And his wife she was first mate, me boys, on board of the 
Panama. 
Then heave away, & e. 
We sailed three days before the mast, when the water it 
got short, 
And every hour each man, me boys, he was allowed a 
quart,; 
We were in latitude a 
hundred and one, no land for many a 
mile, 
And all the provisions we had on board was a 
bottle of 
Castor Oil. 
Then heave . away, &c. 
We fell in with a 
big sand junk bound for a 
foreign shore, 
It's thunder and sparibles said I, me boys, I'll go to sea no 
more; 
We had to sail east, west, north and south to keep clear of 
ships in the bay, 
And three years after that, me boys, we landed down 
Broadway. 
Then heave away, & c. 
Dur captian he gave orders for action to clear the deck, 
When the man at the wheel fell through the hole awl 
nearly broke his neck ; 
I 
holler'd at my messmates till I 
was black in the face, 
But she turned out to be a C4inaman and bound for St. 
Mark's Place.

ALWAYS DO TO OTHERS.—[CoNeLunEn.] 
Perhaps in business you've been wronged 
By some " defaulting rogue," 
For by such scamps the world is thronged, 
They long have been in vogue; 
Don't seek revenge on such a 
wretch, 
But to forgive him try, 
And thus you " do to others, as 
You'd wish to be done by." 
CHORUS.—Then " 
bear good will to all men," 
It's easy if you'll try, 
And " always do to others as 
You'd wish to be done by." 
If you are rich, and some " old friend" 
Is " down at heel" and poor, 
Well, let the bar of station bend, 
And " open wide your door" 
To welcome him, as you were wont 
"In better days gone by," 
And thus you do to him, poor man, 
As " you'd wish to be done by." 
Cuonus.--Then " bear good will to all men," 
It's easy if you try, 
And " always do to others as 
You'd wish to be done by." 
/ 
think by what I've said or sung, 
In this my song to-night, 
That I 
have proved to every one 
The glorious might of right. 
So let us all make this resolve, 
And keep it till we die, 
That is to " do to others as 
We'd wish to be done by." 
Cuonns.—Then " bear good will to all men," 
It's easy if you'll try, 
And " always do to others as 
We'd wish to be done by."

JERSEY SAM 
Oh! I 
was bowl in jersey, 
And of that I'm going to sing; 
And yet it seems but yesterday, 
For time is on the wing. 
I 
went way down to New Orleans, 
And there I 
fought the foe, 
Along with Hickory Jackson, 
Some Fifty Years ago. 
ertonts. 
For I 
am one of the olden time, 
And may be thought too gay, 
But I'm Jersey Sam, the Farmer's man, 
Hurrah! hurrah! hurrah! 
I 
bear the name of Samuel, 
Though some, they call me Sam, 
And through this world I 
rove along, 
As happy as I 
can; 
The world, they say, has been improved 
But I 
should like to know, 
If folks are any better now, 
Than Fifty Years ago. 
For I 
am one, &C. 
When I 
was young, then boys were boys, 
And went to bed at ten; 
But now, when they are twelve years old, 
They think that they are men. 
You'll hear them call for rum and beer, 
And smoke cigars, heigh-ho! 
What would our parents have thought of that 
Sor,e 
Fifty Years ago I 
For I 
am one, &c. 
At midnight, too, one hears yonng men, 
With husky voices sing, 
That " Champagne Charlie" is their name, 
And they know it's no such thing; 
They go to bed with a 
head-ache, 
At least they tell us so. 
I 
never heard of such a 
thing, 
Some Fifty Years ago. 
For I 
am one, Sze 
The women of the present time, 
They cannot draw a 
line: 
But wear our hats and jackets, 
And appear quite masculine ; 
They wear false hair, for it's the style, 
And call it their own ; you know— 
But our girls would scorn to wear a 
wig, 
Some Fifty Years ago. 
For I 
am one gr.e. 
WNY DIDN'2 72.1:'U SAY SO BEFORE. 
As so g 
by Gus W ILLIAMS 
New by-words you know now-a-days, are the rage, 
You'll hear them from every tongue ; 
Wherever you go you'll find that it's so, 
The littl 
the big, old and young; 
Even the ladies are fond of the slang, 
While the boys in the street loudly roar, 
Oh; how they do shout, the latest one out, 
Why didn't you say so before ! 
One day driven mad with a 
toothache so bad, 
I 
rushed to the first doctor's shop, 
When the grinder he eyed and the tongs he applied, 
And he pulled me six times round the shop; 
Said I, when he'd done, you've pulled out the wrong one, 
While with agony loud I 
did roar; 
Now it's done, sir, says he, the fault don't lay with me; 
Why didn't you say so before I 
I 
once asked a 
friend me ten dollars to lend, 
And said : I'd return it next day. 
When he did begin at once to rub his chin, 
And these words, unto me he did say ; 
Old boy, it's too bad, I 
should have been glad, 
In fact, I'd have let you have more 
Had you called yesterday,— now, it's all paid away, 
Why didn't you say so before 
My wife yesterday sat crying away, 
Because our first-born was a 
boy; 
All day she would sigh and keep rubbing her eye, 
Instead of being happy -,7ith joy ; 
Says she to me, Joe, I 
hate boys, you know, 
I'd wane of girls have a 
score; 
Says I ( with a 
leer) it's too late, now, my dear, 
Why didn't you say so before

DOWN AMONG THE COALS. 
Mv Jernima was in service once 
At a 
house in Madis al Square, 
She never got o t 
and so I 
used 
lo go and court her there. 
Her inistresses were two old maids, 
Such very particular souls, 
That Jendina had to cat a 
hide me 
In amongst the coals.

Oh, by Jove it was a 
lark, all alone and in the dark, 
Down arnon , th- coals, down among the coals, 
Waitin. , to make love to my Jeinima. 
When in that cella 
cobwebs used 
To decorate my clothes, 
The coat- dust got into my eyes, 
And would get up my nose; 
And when it rain d 
the water came 
A 
trickling through a 
crack, 
And I 
always fancied spiders were 
A crawling down my back. 
Down among the coals, &c. 
One night they sent Jemima out, 
Who'd forgotten her dear Joe 
'Was (1

And a 
prisoner below. 
I 
began to N

And felt iodine,' to shout, 
At last call'd thro' the keyhole, 
"Here Jernium let's get out." 
Down among the coals, &c. 
At last the door was opened, 
'Twos dark, oh blest of bliss, 
I 
threw my arms around her neck, 
And gave her such a 
kiss. 
A scream and then a

Gave me one upon the head,

TEDDY O'NEALE. 
I've come to the cabin he danced his wild jigs in, 
As neat a 
mud palace as ever was seen; 
And consid'ring it served to keep poultry and pigs in, 
I'm sure it was always most elegant clean. 
But now all about it seems lonely and dreary, 
All sad and silent, no piper, no reel; 
Not even the sun, through the casement, is cheery, 
Since I 
missed the dear darling boy, Teddy O'Neale, 
I 
dreamt but last night—oh, bad luck to my dreaming! 
I'd die if I 
thought `twould come truly to pass— 
But I 
dreamt, white tears down my pillow were streaming. 
That Teddy was courtin' another fair lass; 
Oh! didn't I 
wake with a 
weeping and wailing, 
The grief of that thought was too deep to conceal; 
My mother cried—" Norah, child, what is your ailing?" 
And all I 
could utter was—" Teddy O'Neale." 
Shall I 
never forget when the big ship was ready, 
And the moment was come when my love must depart 
How I 
sobbed like a 
spalpeen, " Good-by to you Teddy," 
With drops on my cheek and a 
stone at my heart, 
IIe says 'tis to better his fortune he's roving, 
But what would be gold to the joy I 
should feel 
If I 
saw him come back to me, honest and loving, 
Still poor, but my own darling, Teddy O'Neal°. -

The pride iv her dad an' his dairy ; 
Oh ! she was his delight an' the pearl iv his sight, 
An' as frisliky an' blythe as a

Poor old Ned loved his daughter, for an angel he thought her,

'Tim his birth was a

Sez her father, " Daunt raise me, for the divil may Baize me,

I KNOW SOMETHING. 
Written, Composed and sung by Gcs W ILLIAMS. 
I 
know something which I 
don't mind telling you, 
But ke-. p 
it a 
secret, now mind, 
Becourse off my wife was to find it out, too, 
I 
know that mit rage she'd go blind 
It's about a 
young girl what I 
meet thother day, 
While walking along in the street— 
And I 
know off this young girl know'd I 
had a 
wife 
L'he wouldn't think I 
was so sweet. 
CHORUS. 
Now you know what I 
know, and what my wife don't know, 
She don't know what I 
know, and what I 
know you know, 
If you tell her what you know, and also what I 
know, 
Then she'd know what I 
know, what you know also. 
I 
know that this young girl wore lots of false hair, 
I 
could see dat at once at a 
glance, 
I 
klow that her feet was much larger than mine, 
I 
found dat out when we did dance. 
She got beauty spots all over her face, 
I 
don't want to make fun at all, 
She'd a 
mole on her cheek as red as a 
beet, 
And it look'd like a 
big cod-fish ball. 
Now you know what I 
know, (te. 
This girl's hair was red or a 
strawberry blonde, 
Her eyebrows hung down to her nose ; 
She'd a 
mouth dat when open looked like a 
mouse- trap, 
it worked on a 
spring, I 
suppose. 
But still she's a 
beauty dongside of my wife. 
To-morrow I 
get a 
Divorce— 
And the secret 
I (lout mind telling you— 
I 
marry this young girl, of course. 
Now you know what I 
bow. 
THE COVE ON WIRES. 
Written by J. W . 
LLOYD. 
am a 
sprightly sort of chap, 
As you can plainly see, 
Though hopping, skipping all the day, 
It never tires me ; 
For on the day that I 
was born, 
I 
made the people roar, 
I 
jumped clean off the nurse's knee, 
And tumbled on the floor. 
CHORUS, 
I 
tumble up, I 
tumble down. 
A chap that never t 
res, 
By all the boys throughout the town, 
Pm called the Cove on wires. 
And as I 
grew advanced in years, 
At school I 
couldn't stop, 
Bee muse my tumbling tricks would 
Always make me play the hop ; 
But in all kinds of running games, 
I'd take them by surprise, 
At football, through my kicking powers, 
I 
always won the prize. 
I 
tumble up, dm. 
At last I 
thought I'd married get, 
So tried to find a 
wife, 
And soon I 
joined a 
sprightly lass, 
To jog along through life ; 
Though I 
could jump before I 
wed, 
As some of you have seen, 
But if you saw me sometimes now, 
You'd think I 
went by steam. 
I 
tumble up, &c. 
When we were wed, my wife and I, 
Stuck to our work like bricks, 
And now I 
am the father of, 
A family of six. 
Yes, half a 
dozen boys and girls, 
Whom everyone admires, 
You'd take them for young marionettes, 
And think they went on wires. 
I 
tumble up, cEe.

IT'S NAUGHTY, -BUT ITS -NICE.—[CoNctunn I 
Last night I 
called at Westbourne Grove, 
And asked if she would go 
A 
walk, and we would talk of love; 
At first she answered, " No l" 
Then consented, and we walked and talked— 
I 
thought it paradise,— 
But she said 'twas wrong; I 
answered,— 
Well, it's naughty, but it's nice.—Cuo. 
I 
put my arm around her waist, 
Her form I 
gently pressed; 
And then she laid her lovely face 
Upon my manly chest. 
1 
kiss'd her two times on the cheek, 
I 
would have kissed her thrice, 
But I 
whispered, Ain't it naughty! 
She said, Yes, but it's so nice.—Cno.. 
To-day she asked if she might wed, 
Her ma exclaimed, My dear! 
You must not think of marrying Fred 
For many and many a 
year: 
It's wicked, miss, your pa and ma 
And home to sacrifice. 
To get married—well, I 
know, said she, 
It's naughty, but it's nice. 
Ciao.—If you think marriage wicked, ma, 
You're guilty of that vice; 
You perhaps may call it naughty, 
But you also know it's nice. 
Her parents have consented, and 
In two years she will be 
My wife; so now you know my tale: 
I 
hope you will give to me 
The same applause, that from you all 
So often I 
entice ; 
It's naughty Vrtraps to ask it, 
But to get it is so nice.—O.

Where sausages strong, 
And pretzels long, a

Then into lloossia I 
have rushed, 
The land of furs and capes, 
The men all make the women work, 
And the soldiers look like apes. 
For I'm a

With a 
turn o' my wrist, 
My stick I

And I 
am my mother's joy. 
To China thin I

And got my hearts contint 
Of the briny say, 
And wretch-ed bad tay 
Enough to make me squint; 
Japan then came in view, 
Be my sowl I 
saw that too, 
But yellow Jack nigh broke my back, 
That's why I 
look so blue. 
Then sailin' limner stars and stripes 
I 
reached Columbh's shore. 
And now I 
love the place so well, 
I'll never leave it more. 
Except the cry will be, 
"Come. Paddy, join with mo 
And brave once more.

And make etdd Ireland free."

BARTHOLGBIEW Dovrtrzo4 
By our camp-fires rose n 
murmur 
At the dawning of the day, 
And the tread of many footsteps 
Spoke the advent of the fray; 
And as we took our places, 
Few and stern were oar words, 
While some were tightening horse-girths, 
And others girding swords. 
The trumpet blast has sounded 
Our footmen to array— 
The willing steed has hounded, 
Impatiunt for the fray— 
The green flag is unfolded, 
While rose the cry of joy 
"'Heaven speed dear Ireland's banner, 
To-day at Fontenoy ' 
We looked upon that banner, 
And the memory arose 
Of our home and perished kindred, 
Where the Lee or Shannon flows; 
We looked upon that banner, 
And we swore to God on high, 
To smite to-day the Saxons' might, 
To conquer or to die! 
Loud swells the charging trumpet--
'Tis a 
voice from our own land— 
God of battles—God of vengeance, 
Guide to day the patriot's brand; 
There are stains to wash away— 
There are memories to destroy, 
In the best blood of the Briton, 
To-day at Fontenoy. 
Plunge deep the fiery rowels, 
In a 
thousand reeking flanks— 
Down chivalry of Ireland, 
Down on the British ranks—

And then we'd die with joy, 
One day upon our own dear land 
Like this of Fontenoy !

Alas, that game did not hist lit. g,

For soon I 
spent the marriage portion, 
Oa my wedding- day these clothes were new 
We went to church, so blythe ami merry, 
Thli hat of mine was new and light, 
We drank our crusted port and sherry, 
And ev'ry eye was beaming bright. 
But you, poor hat, can tell t

Of where we go, and what we do, 
But how you stand it is a

And seldom \were yon skirts e'er muddied,

And you, poor boots, were bright as any, 
You really were a 
lovely pair. 
Cleaning you've cost many a 
penny, 
I 
took you with me ey'rywhere, 
But farewell to the soles departed— 
For may poor toes they do peep through- - 
And you, poor tops, look quite faint-hearted, 
How different now, then you were new. 
Anti you, poor gloves, my hands did shelter. 
Yet still I 
held you in my love, 
We through tint world went better skelter. 
Like true friends, living hand and glove.

OH I'M SO FOND OF DANCING. 
Oh, I'm so fond of dancing, I 
never can say no. 
While the dances are advancing on a 
light fantastic toe; 
And when at balls or parties, I 
am sure to cut a 
swell, 
For in dancing there my heart is, as every one can ten. 
CHORUS. 
Oh I'm so fond of dancing, I 
never can say no, 
While the bright eyes are advancing on a

In the lancers I'm perfection, mazurka is my forte, 
By the ladies in general my hand is often sought, 
The gents give looks of envy as we go gliding by, 
And the ladies in the Waltz s 
are often heard to sigh. 
Oh, I'm so fond, Ito. 
We never care for sorrow, my heart is free and light, 
For I'm dancing in the morning, the evening and the night, 
We never care for trouble, we never do complain, 
And if we lose our sweethearts, another too we'll gain.

Oh thin these are the terrible times. 
The American bacon they say, (though the prices now and then 
vary), 
Every bit of it comes all the way, from that darlin' ould town 
Tipperary ; 
If you take a 
walk up the main street, sure its there where the 
wonderful trade is, 
Fine Cumberland cuts there you'll get, and beautiful 
floury 
potatoes, 
Notwithstanding the terrible times. 
And sure when the boys at home riz, sure the ructions were 
terribly awful, - 
But the peelers soon showed them that rows, were unpleasant

But sure what the row was about, there wasn't one of them

BROKEN DOWN. 
Once I'd money plenty! 
And friends, too, by the score, 
Then fortune smiled upon me 
And no one passed my door, 
Now I'm poor and lonely, 
And not worth fifty cents, 
Now no one seem to know me, 
I'm completely broken down 
CHORUS. 
I 
wander thro' the world, 
And meet with many a 
frown, 
No one seems to know Inc now, 
Because l'm broken down. 
With an ample fortune 
I 
went it rather fast, 
The pace was almost killing, 
And I 
found it couldn't last. 
Too proud to put the curb on, 
I 
thought myself high-bred, 
And now, for want of ' bread' at times 
I 
have to ' fast' instead. 
I

The immortal Shakespeare 
Says, All the world's a 
stage' 
And every man must play his part. 
From childhood to old age; 
And when I 
think of days gone by, 
How I 
was made the tool 
Of rogues, and sharps, tis then I 
know, 
My part' hail been the fool.' 
I 
wander, cto. 
Friends could recognize me, 
When Poole he made my coat, 
But when I 
had no ' Note to change,' 
flow soon they changed their note 
Ata object sad and needy, 
I 
wander thro' the town, 
A 
living paradox am I, 
Hard up,' yet ' Broken Down.' 
I 
wander thro' the world, 
And meet with many a 
frown, 
The time to try your friends you'll find, 
Is when you're broken down. 
IS HEART WAS TRUE TO POLL. 
AIlt:—" In 1869." 
I 
heard my aunt once sing a 
chant, 
Which now pYapi isn't new, 
Of Billy Kidd, who, whatever he did, 
To his Poll was always true. 
He sailed away in a 
gallant ship 
From the pretty port of jovial Bristol, 
And the last words as he uttered, 
While his hankerchec he fluttered, 
Were " My heart is true to Poll." 
CHORUS. 
My heart is true to Poll, (
businees) 
No matter what you do, 
If your heart is ever true, 
And his heart was true to Poll. 
They were wrecked. 
William, to shore he swam, 
And he looked abut for an inn, 
When a 
noble savage lady, of a 
color rather shady, 
Came up, with a 
cheerful grin; 
Says she, " Marry me, and a 
king you'll be, 
And in a 
pain e 
loll, 
Or they'll eat you like a 
filet ;" 
So he gave his hand, did Billy, 
But his heart was true to Poll. 
My heart is true to Poll, &c. 
So William Kidd a 
happy life led 
As the King of Kikaroos. 
He had nothing but a 
hat upon his head, 
And a 
pair of over-shoes. 
They made him a 
preAent of twenty wives, 
Which their beauties I 
cannot now extol; 
But one day they all revolted, 
So he back to Bristol bolted, 
For his heart was true to Poll. 
My heart is true to Pull, Ize. (Dance.)

CASTLES IN THE AIR. 
First introduced and sung in America by W . 
F. 
S. 
LAWLOR. 
This world is all a 
babble, wherever we may go, 
There's nothing hora bat troa b les, hardship, toil and woe; 
Go where we will, do what we may. we are never free from care, 
nd at the best, this world is but. a Castle in the Air. 
We are rocked upon the sea of life, just like a 
little boat, 
And some get wrecked upon the rocks, and never get afloat; 
But we will do the best we can, and never let despair 
-Usurp the place between us, and our Castles in the Air. 
There is a 
name known o'er the world, to Englishmen ' tis dear, 
And well may they be prutlof him, their native Bard Shake 
speare; 
When first his plays came cn the stage, be made the world stars 
And yet they were composed, while building Castles in the Air. 
If you take the works of Shakespeare, and study them well 
through, 
You 11 find his sayings are so wise, each sentimert so true; 
They'll ma':e you feel while reading them, as ifyoim had been there, 
And yet they were composed while building Castles lathe Air. 
tnt yet there is another name, to Scotchmen dearer still, 
And though a 
real true Scottish heart, ' twill make the blood to 
thrill, 
And though this world t-) him had been, a 
world full or care; 
Yet Burns was always happy, building Castles in the Air. 
His home a 
lowly Ploughman's Cot, yet strife there ne'er was seen, 
So happy and contented had he lived wee his Jean ; 
Beside the bank 0' Bonny Doon, near to the town O'Ayr, 
The immortal Bobby Burns, built bright Castles in the Air. 
The Irish had their poet too, they loved him well I'm sure. 
He was a 
true born Irishman, his name was Thomas Moore; 
Of this world's sorrows, we know be had his share, 
Yet Moore was always happy, building Castles in th- Air. 
He sang the rights of Ireland, he sang against her wrongs, 
And many loving Irish hearts, wil' cherish yet his songs; 
He made the Irish heart rejoice, he bade them ne'er despair, 
And for Ireland in the future, Built bright Castles in the Air.

May no fstal blunder e'er tear them asunder, 
But long be they wreathed in the island of green. 
The sweet little island, & c. 
Success to old Ireland, its bog and its mireland., 
There's not such a

For honor, for spirit, fidelity. merit. 
For wit and eeml fellowship, frolic and fun ; 
With wine and with whiskey, when once he gets frisky, 
An Irishman's heart in true colors is seen, 
While with mirth overflowing, with love it is glowing, 
With love for its own native island of green.

Yes, my old dad was a 
money making notary; 
And sipping his wine, has often told 
That woman was a 
riddle, and marriage a 
lottery, 
And wives at the altar were bought and sold; 
His reason for this I 
cannot divine, 
For it was not the ease with this wife of mine; 
She'd a 
father and a 
mother, and a 
sister and a 
brother. 
And they all got a 
living in the hardware line. 
CHORUS. 
She'd a 
father and a 
mother, and a 
sister and a 
brother, 
And they all got a 
living in the hardware line. 
The words that he uttered caused quite a 
panic 
In my youthful mind, so I 
soon did decide 
To cut broad-cloth, and, in the garb of a 
mechanic, 
From the unwashed multitude seek a 
bride. 
Twas there I 
found this wife of mine, 
When I 
laid my heart at Cupid's shrine ; 
She'd a 
father and a 
mother, and a 
si -
ster and a 
brother, 
And they all got a 
living in the hardware line. 
She'd a 
father, &c. 
Every town and village, I 
did rummage 'em, 
England, Ireland, and Scotland through, 
Till at last I 
came to the good oh l 
town of Brummagem, 
A 
second edition of the Wand'ring Jew. 
'Twas there I 
lost this heart of mine, 
To one of the gender feminine,

THE HARDWARE LINE. [CONCLUDED. 
She'd a 
father and a 
mother, and a 
sister and a 
brother, 
And they all got a 
living in the hardware line. 
She'd a 
father, &c. 
Her brother was a 
gunsmith, her sister was a 
burnisher, 
Her mother made buttons at three-pence a 
gross, 
And her father he plated harness-furniture, 
She kept the books of profit and loss. 
Three months for her did I 
waste and pine, 
Before I 
asked her to resign, 
Her father and her mother, her sister and her brother, 
That all got a 
living in the hardware line. 
She'd a 
father, &e. 
She's a 
first rate hand at a 
brewing or a 
baking; 
She can knit silk purses, or make mince pies ; 
Her bonnets and her dresses are all her own making, 
Her home-made bread takes all by surprise ; 
Champagne or claret from the hanks of the Rhine, 
Can't be compared to her gooseberry wine, 
Though she's a 
father and a 
mother, a 
sister and a 
brother, 
And they all get a 
living in the hardware line. 
She'd a 
father, (Ice. 
My clays they pass in one round of pleasure, 
I 
feel as if I 
should never grow old, 
For a 
wife that is good, is a 
priceless treasure, 
And more to a 
man than silver and gold ; 
Far better than a 
useless lady fine, 
Is this busy, merry, cheerful little wife of mine, 
Though she's a 
father and a 
mother, and asister and bro-
ther, 
And they all get a

THE CONVIVIAL MAN. 
They tell me there's nothing like pleasure, 
r1'0 keep honest fellows alive; 
So, I 
take lots of that at my leisure, 
And manage upon it to thrive. 
You will find when the %vine is before us 
And harmony freely began, 
I'm an excellent hand at a 
chorus, 
And quite a 
convivial man. 
CHORUS. Then, ha, ha, ha! I 
merrily sing 
Gentlemen, follow my plan, 
Whatever may befall. I'm happy withal, 
For, I'm a 
convivial man. 
It's true that I 
am not over wealthy; 
And yet I 
have riches most rare. 
Being happy, contented and healthy 
And not overweighted with care; 
3Iy heart is as light as a 
feather, 
I 
find it an excellent plan 
To chirrup in all sorts of weather : 
Fin such a 
convivial man ! 
Then, ha, ha, ha! &c. 
I'm asked out to every dinner, 
Invited to parties and halls: 
There's no fear of my getting thinner, 
Whilst favoured with these kind of calls; 
At a 
picnic, a 
wedding or christening, 
They- will have me there. if they can: 
And no one receives such a 
greeting, 
I'm such a 
convivial man ! 
Then, ha, ha, ha! &C. 
I 
cheer up the aged. 
God bless, em ! 
I 
frolic and play with time young: 
They smile as I 
kindly address cm, 
And laugli at my joke or my song. 
My days are unclouded, and sunny, 
I'm sought by each party and elan ; 
Oh ! believe me, it's better than money, 
And be a 
convivial man ! 
Then. ha, ha, ha! &c. 
Then long as I 
live I'll be merry, 
Enjoying the I 
hue as it dies ; 
Drinking tea it I 
cannot get sherry, 
And always be merry and wise, 
I 
will warble and sing like a 
linnet 
And, since life is only a 
span, 
Make the most of the world, whilst I'm in it, 
And be a 
convivial man ! 
Then, ha, ha, ha! &c.
