"Dear Mr. President", Middlebury, Vermont, January or February 1942
AFS 6451A
Elmer George: Mr. President, I am Elmer George of North Montpelier, Vermont and I address you in
your capacity as Commander in Chief of a nation of which I, although of somewhat humble origin,
am proud to be a native citizen.
You are no doubt aware that these country people in some of these New England states survive
chiefly by farming and lumbering which makes necessary the use of motor vehicles and motored
power. This makes us dependent on gasoline and oils for power. The present vehicles are mostly
mounted on rubber and originally designed so that they cannot be changed over to be used on
anything else. It is also practically impossible to use horse-drawn farm and lumber vehicles on our
highways since the advent of year-round motor roads. You can easily see how it is quite a problem
for us to carry on these activities under the conditions that presently exist relative to fuel entire
situation.
However, necessity is the mother of invention and we are all out to trim Hitler and the damn Japs by
producing all the foodstuffs that we can and buying bonds and stamps. That is, those of us that have
anything to buy with after paying for fertilizers and the taxes that have been bestowed upon us.
For we are a people who usually manage to carry the load and bear the burden. Although there are
times when, as the other fellow said, it is about all the steers can handle. I will now call on our state
senator, Raymond B. Daniels of Woodbury, Vermont, to tell us how he thinks the people from his
neck of the woods would respond to the situation. Mr. Daniels.
Raymond B. Daniels: Mr. President, history proves that Vermonters will go the limit to preserve their
freedom and independence. They will make any sacrifice and carry out any orders necessary to bring
this war to a successful conclusion. They will grimly subject themselves to any danger and apply
themselves to any task in order to accomplish this big job that we have to do.
In dealing with our people however, Mr. President, strict frankness should be adhered to. Upmost
care should be taken to avoid any results that would give an appearance of misrepresentation. This
does not mean that an honest mistake on anybody's part will be fatal to the cause. Vermonters and
New Englanders are always reasonable. But on the other hand, if too much frivolous, non-essential
lost motion is made a part of any program they are apt to think that the book isn't worth the candle.

On the whole, they can be relied upon to meet the acid test and with the same spirit that the Green
Mountain boys followed Ethan Allen. If you will tell us what to do we will do it.
