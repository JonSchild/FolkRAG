Speaker: I don't never did anything like this. That's where I was born, on the farm. You
mean before I was married when I was on the farm -- Well when I was growing up you
lived on a farm and we hadda get up in the morning 5-5:30, milk the cows, then the
cows everything got cleaned, the cows got out in the field and someone usually did the
chickens. We lived where a stream went through a small river, creek like, and someone
did the chickens and then you started at the other work. All a was farm work as I think of it
now what My children here don't didn't have to go through that. We did everthing by hand.
That a wheats, oats, everthing got cut off with a binder and four horses and we had to
shock it. On shocks, Then we had take it in then it got thrashed--this was all by hand. That
was our day.
Speaker: When I talked to my grand-- I have grandchildren, I have 17 grandchildren, and
our children here are eleven, well they had to work too. We did it long, I mean without
tractor or automobile or you just couldn't make it no more. So when the girls, the three
oldest the girls and when they didn't milk no more and were through school to the country
school over here -- then they went into the factory. Then the <gap> boys came next, they
had to milk. They didn't milk long by hand. They had to have a milk machine. No. You were
used to doing that and you did it. I said to my one grandson, I said, You're gonna be a
weakling because you come home -- he didn't know what to do -- I said, when my children
come home they got a big pan of oatmeal that they hadda eat and they did -- they ate that
fast then they went out and each one hadda do his work. So, corn and grass.

Speaker: See you have your hay then, you have corn to grind for your chickens or pigs or
cows and oats. And the wheat you usually sold most of it. Yea, well that's how the people
used to think you had to farm but see they don't farm like that no more. The next neighbor
here, they have a a big chicken house -- all automatic, they say. I wasn't in it yet. And they
have steers then. They don't bother with a couple of a this or that. Yea, see a farmer they
don't make money -- they can't -- they don't make hardly no money they can't have a little
of this and a little of that and live and pay for the electric bill, everbody has a telephone
bill, it costs too much. They they gotta have -- they gotta go in deeper like you have twenty
cows, you gotta have 50-60 maybe you gotta have more then they call you're a dairy
farmer. or if you have hogs well then you raise more of those so you have a little profit
from it, that you can live. Yes, when December come -- all summer -- that I missed a little
bit, if you think back. You ate smoked meat well these hams were smoked and they were
hung in the smoke house and you know by late summer when the temperature you know
the humidity or what it is changes, it molded a little then you had to brush that off, like then
we cut it off, trimmed it -- and that went out to the dogs. So fresh meat I like that better.
Yea, see that was so hard, you hadda salt these hams for three, four weeks you salted
them then you put them in the smoke house, cured them. Well then you had those hams
for a whole summer and then in the fall, well the meat got scarce. You had some summer
sausage meat but that got so hard you could hardly cut it and it was salty you know you
have to
3. 60
Speaker: salt it to hold it. You had to put a lot of salt on the meat so I agree with the
freezer now and have a little meat in having fresh meat. Then as soon as it got December
or it got colder they butchered. Then the work started again, you hadda take care of all
this meat. You salted the hams but then some of the meat you put in jars, you cooked it
on the stove. The sausages you fried, put them in jars -- I usually put only so much fat

and turned the jars up side down so they were tight -- then you hadda put that meat away
for a whole year. Now, well they have to put it away but what they do put everything in
a freezer, then it's fresh. Yea, well, the frying sausage, you mean? <unintelligible text>?
They put it through the grinder the meat and a well the butchers now they usually have
tubs and they know how much salt to put in and pepper. They would just mix it and it gets
put in there, there isn't that much to that. Now the summer sausage well there I know my
mother at home when we made some there was so much salt, so much pepper and so
much brown sugar and I think a little bit saltpeter. I questioned her once, I said for what
is this, that's to keep the color a little bit that it was a little bit pink or red. Now you don't
know what fer color is at the meat, now. It's red and well some is just butchered, you can
tell. It isn't all butchered that day when you go in the store -- this hangs for weeks and it's
sold. Well, we here when we butchered we butchered one beef and then we butchered two
or three pigs what we needed for the year and then the intestines from the pig, the small
ones, those got a -- I always had a shingle -- a shingle, what they put it on -- a wooden
shingle
4. 93
Speaker: a smooth one, really smooth, I put it away year that was my shingle and with
a dull table knife I scraped them. A neighbor woman soon asked me, she said How do
you clean those -- How do you clean em? I said put em on a smooth shingle and take the
back of you knife which is not sharp, and scrape em -- that's paper thin, you see through.
If you let some in you can tell. That's clean. So that's what you used and you could buy
those that time already -- if you got to the <unintelligible text>, well if you didn't have
enough, if you made a lot of sausage. I mean if you cut alot of the meat up for sausages --
<unintelligible text> some -- I know my oldest daughter they don't care for sausages that
much. Then they save their other meat, they keep it on roasts or well whatever cuts they
want of meat. The pigs stomach I cleaned, you know it had two -- the inner lining and the
outer. Well the pig's stomach is really muscle and the inside is what you discard, put away

it threw away. And if I could clean em and I did it right aways when you got them emptied,
everything cleaned out, and I did it right aways in warm water, you could clean them in
15 minutes. And some say "Oh, no, that takes me much longer." Well it all depends then,
too, if they have it laying someplace, it might freeze like all this cold weather what we
have, freezing everything's ice cold right aways. Didn't you never eat any? Oh, that's one
a -- that's a grandson of mine -- his mother, she loves that. Pigs stomach. You di -- peel
potatoes, then you dice em and then you cut some of that frying sausage in, inch and a
half pieces -- you put that in -- what else does she put in? I think a little cabbage or celery
5. 120
Speaker: but at home we always put only diced potatoes and sausages in. That was a
winter evening meal -- That was good. Oh, yea, we cooked it soft the potatoes was soft --
well so the sausage was cooked, also. And then we laid it out in the frying pan. The stove
was always hot -- just laid it in the pan and turned it around. You hadda be careful your
sewing where you cut it open when it gets soft the string tears sometimes, good though.
No, that's good, you gotta go someplace where they have that and try it. You gotta try that.
Yes, at the one end it's really, well the muscle is really <unintelligible text> that was my
best part when it's real thin I don't care for it, stringy a little bit you know if you if you'd fry it
that it would be too brown, I don't care for it then. Yea, just -- it just takes a couple minutes.
You have a little bit fat in the pan and just turn it aound and.
