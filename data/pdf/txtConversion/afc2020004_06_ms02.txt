Cathy Tagnak Rexford:  My name is Cathy Tagnak Rexford and this is “Anchorage, 1989.” 
 
[Cathy Tagnak Rexford reads “Anchorage, 1989”] 
 
CTR:  So, I began writing this poem in 2011. At the time I was living in Utqiagvik, which is the 
northernmost city in the United States, and it’s situated on the north slope of Alaska, which is 
the hub of the north slope—for the Iñupiat of the north slope. 
 
I finished this poem in 2020 and I currently now live in Boulder, Colorado. So, obviously, in my 
own life I migrate and I move away and come back to my home lands, and that aspect of this 
poem is meaningful and powerful to me, and I am just so grateful that it is a part of this 
collection and that it will be joining in spirit with other indigenous voices. And I’m so grateful. 
Quyanaqpak.
