from original tape W 19.
INTERVIEWER I: Is there some question that you would like to ask
INTERVIEWER II: (inaudible) ... the Ellis Island. And the Bunkers. How they treated you.
What happened then?
INFORMANT: Very good. Very good. They give us the biggest steak I never seen in my
life. And one big potato on the side. That a, I think the drink was coffee and water. I was so
hungry for that steak and that potato.
INT I: After those beets, I'd think so.
INF: Yes. And I think I sec, I skipped the coffee. I couldn't drink coffee after a meal. I drink
water and a big steak and fruit and bread, and all that stuff, you know. But we was big
tables, you know, loaded with immigrants. But they was very good.
INT I: Who provided the meal?

INF: Well, it must be United States government because...
INT I: A welcoming ...
INF: Yeah, a welcoming.
INT II: (unintelligible)
INF: (unintelligible) But, we had a beautiful shower rooms. We shave and clean-up and
shower rooms, you know, very nice, very
C 19 page two
clean, everything. And after I got through with inspections in there, one American man, he
took me New York central, to the (unintelligible). And I guess they saw our papers, and
where I was going, in Utah, all that, and they put me on the right train, to come to West.
The only problem, I didn't have no necktie, I couldn't get it in the, on the trains I knew from.
That's the only problem I had.
INT I: That's one thing they forgot to tell you.
INF: Yeah.
INT II: You came here to, to herd sheep?

afc1986022.afc1986022_ms1802
INF: Yes.
INT II: To herd sheep.
INF: Yeah. We, we had, the only way they let us come to the United States is to work with
the sheep. So I work five years for somebody else, with the (unintelligible), not with the
company, and then after five years, three guys got together, we put money together, and
we start buying our own sheep and our own land. Right after five years, I couldn't speak
very good English yet, very good, but we made it alright.
INT I: But, you never seemed to harbor a resentment that the Basque people could only
come in for one occupation, whereas other nationalities could take any job.
INF: Any job. Yeah. That's one thing ...
INT I: But you never, you didn't let that hold you back.
INF: No. Oh no. I was determined. I knew United States was very rich country. If I go over
there, I going make money.
C 19 page 3
And I think what I try to, anything, to start, you know. Yes, I, didn't matter for me. In fact, I
like it. There's, in 1925, 1930, this Western Slope was beautiful--lots of deer, rabbits, and
wild chickens, you know. Oh, it was most beautiful thing!

INT I: Did you hunt a lot?
INF: Yes. Yeah, I love hunt and fish. And trap coyotes, mountain lions. And if I saw some
tracks in the snow or anywhere, next day or so, I had it in my little trap. It usually was
there!
INT I: Did you ever use bow and arrow to hunt with?
INF: No. No, in Basque country, we didn't have bow and arrow. But, I was a very sharp,
very sharpshooter, I was trained in the in the Army. And just for instance, one time I was
working for the Overton, I saw coyote coming up a little draw. And I hide myself behind
the bushes. And there was a little lake, and he was coming there to drink water. Toungue
sticking out, he was coming right in the water hole. I waited long enough, and I hit him right
between the eyes with the 30/30. And to hit coyote like that, you got to be pretty damn
sharp, I'm telling you. Mr. Robert, he was very glad. We had a lot of losses, you know.
INT I: I was going to ask you if you had a lot of losses.
INF: A lot of losses, yeah.
INT I: From coyotes.
INF: Oh yeah. Lot of losses.
INT I: And at that time you could only shoot them. They didn't put out any of this poison.

INF: No. Those days, that thing, there was no thing they could
C 19 page 4
eat, no poison at all. And we trap them. And I caught a lot of them trapping. And you
have to learn how to make the scent to fool them, you know. It's, it's a very artistic system
because coyotes are very, very smart.
INT II: <gap> did you ever know <gap> A painter, and artist who used to ...
INF: No, I never metted him. I saw his paintings, and I admire his work, a wonderful work.
But I never met him.
INT II: You know, his sister lives here. She lives here. <gap> who used to be on the
(unintelligible) police department...

two thousand goats up at Lake Park. Lot of goats!
INT II: Oh yes, I remember that.
INT I: I never knew that.
INF: Oh yeah. They ...
INT II: Nobody likes them.
INF: No, nobody likes them. We came from Price, Utah with 6000 sheep, three herds,
2000 each. And the boss, I was, told me, "You watch very good. Don't mix with those
goats out there." So I herd them day and night, the sheep, so we don't mix them with those
goats, you know. Then finally, the old man died and fortunately he put sheep instead of
goats.
INT: Oh. That was probably one of the largest herds of goats that was ever had in here.
INF: Out here, ever, yeah. But we used to get lots of rain, lots of snow those days. And
vegetation was beautiful here. Lots of flowers on the desert here, you know. All over here.

Redland, there was no (unintelligible). We stayed away to 6000 sheep in Redland, I don't
know how long. There was no home,
C 19 page 6
nothing that we, just come down the river, and water sheep, and just let it go back. It was
an old wooden bridge. On the main street.
INT I: That'd be in the late 1920's.
INF: Late 1920's.
INT II: I'd like to have you back to our house. He probably remembers the hill.
INT I: Probably had some sheep up there where our house is sitting.
INF: Yeah, oh yeah. Yeah, we had someday. Well, some day we go out on the Redlands
out there, you know, and the hills are all (unintelligible). And I tried to locate where we
camped in there, you know. But now the people they build homes and all (unintelligible).

long time, and I heard a lot of commotion up in Lincoln Park. So I went out there-and I
want to ride those things, you know.

INF I: So, I go out there, I find two girls. This one, another girl, on the (unintelligible).
INT I: Ferris wheel.
INF I: Yeah, wheel there. And I couldn't hardly speak English, very little. I asked one girl,
"You like to go like that?" And she says, "Yes." So I took her up, and when we come down
she says, "How come you didn't ask me?". "Well, it's your turn now, do you want to go?".
