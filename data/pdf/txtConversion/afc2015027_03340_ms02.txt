what’s a female day laborer?

What are your responsibilities when you go there? 
2:58: First, we get there and wait to see if someone comes for us. We wait under the sun, or the cold. 
There are many women. Some don’t like us to go, like when you’re new. It’s hard. 
QUESTION: What’s a good day and a bad day on the stop? 
3:27 A good day is like on Fridays, when they take you for 6 hours. And the bad is that some tell you 
they’d pay $10 or $11 and when you’re done with the work, they tell you that only $8 or $9 because 
they don’t have money to pay us. 
QUESTION: How many women are on the stop? How’s your relationship with them?  
3:56 We are approximately 56 to 60, sometimes more. The relationships aren’t great, because we’re all 
different. Some don’t speak, others have a bad temper. The relationship isn’t good.  
QUESTION: What skills do you need to be a domestic worker? 
04:25 The skill? Be willing to work, specially cleaning. And be available during the day.  
QUESTION: What’s the necessary training to be a successful domestic worker?  
04:46 Do your job well, but sometimes they don’t have enough cleaning supplies to get the job done, so 
it’s not good.  
QUESTION: Have you learned any skills or tricks that attract employers? (repeats it) When the employers 
go to the stop, do you approach them, or do they chose you? How does it work?  
05:40 Since there are many women, they pick one. They (the employers) are the ones who choose the 
women.  
QUESTION: Do you have any specialty? (explains) 
06:10  Oh, my job is… I used to archive files. But since I am undocumented, and I don’t speak perfect 
English, I work as a day laborer.

14:03 I’m a member of the Worker’s Justice Project. 
QUESTION: When do domestic work, do you feel like you’re part of a larger community? 
14:17 We don’t work as domestic workers there. We work hourly, or daily, not as domestic <<NOTE: In

QUESTION: But do you feel that you’re part of a bigger group or community by being a domestic 
worker? 
14:43 No.  
QUESTION: When and how did you get involved in the Worker’s Justice Program? How did you find it?  
15:13 I became a member of the organization because there were women who came to offer us 
workshops, meetings, leadership, and I tried going and learned a lot there. They taught me a lot. That’s 
why I became a member of the organization.  
QUESTION: do you know anything about the domestic workers bill of rights? If you do, please explain 
how you’ve applied it to your life and work.  
16:08 On that stop we don’t have any rights. We would like someone who would be vigilant, because a 
domestic worker is different to a day laborer. A domestic worker means you’re full time a t a home. 
Maybe they do have rights, but we don’t have anyone to back us up, because it’s just for a few hours.  
QUESTION: What would you like to see in the future in relation with the Domestic Workers Bill of Rights, 
or with other protections for domestic workers? 
16:47 I would like to get support for all the women who are there, a good salary, so that we are 
respected and have some kind of support, or maybe ask many questions. That I would like.  
QUESTION: Why is the support of the Worker’s Justice Program and other groups for domestic workers 
important?  
17:16 The Worker’s Justice Program it’s very important to me because I’ve learned a lot from them in all 
the workshops and meetings. 
QUESTION: What do you want politicians to know about domestic workers?  
17:39 I would like them to know that we are also valuable and deserve the same respect as those 
women who work full time at a home. Because there at the stop we don’t get any support. We don’t 
have any back up, any rights.  
QUESTION: What kind of education or training would you like to get? (repeats it)

18:14 I would like to learn and educate many colleagues who are, there to join organizations like the 
Project. There they educate us with the workshops and all. For example, let the employers know our 
rights.  
QUESTION: What training did you get at the Worker’s Justice Project? 
18:51 I’ve learned many things; for example, to require them (the employers) to give me a mop, a fixed 
salary. I’ve learned leadership. I’ve learned to make organic products. I’ve learned technology. I’ve 
learned many important things.  
QUESTION: Do you have any final thoughts you would like to share? (explains) 
19:41 I would like to exhort other women to go to organizations, because there is where we learn about 
our rights.

work at the stop. She agrees and asks for the questions to be repeated.>> 
22:06 QUESTION: Could you describe me the stop for those who don’t know it? And could you also 
explain what’s a female day laborer? 
22:15 The stop is a one block corner. There are many women there. The street is Marcy Ave. and 
Division. There are about 100 women. It’s a place where we get a lot of sun and a lot of cold. We don’t 
have a bathroom. The employers take advantage with our salaries, and our time. They’d tell us 5 hour 
but then it’s actually 2.  
QUESTION: And could you also explain what’s a female day laborer? 
23:05 A female day laborer, is us, the women who go there to wait for someone to pick us up and take 
us to a place to work. We are exposed to many situations.

23:30 The first time I was there I was brought by a friend because I need work and it was about two 
years ago.  
 QUESTION: What’s the daily routine at the stop when you get there? What happens while you’re there? 
What are your responsibilities when you go work? What’s the routine like at the parade? 
24:06 The routine at the stop is being there waiting for an employer to come. Just stand there the whole 
time, that’s the routine.  
QUESTION: What are your responsibilities when you go work? 
24:29 The responsibilities are to try to meet the employers expectations. Look up the address where we 
are going to, and just look after one another. Take care of each other. That’s our responsibility.
