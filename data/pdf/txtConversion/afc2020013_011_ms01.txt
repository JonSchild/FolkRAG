[17:35]   
Challenges in Kart Racing 
Frustration of not knowing what’s going on sometimes 
Doing great some weeks and not others 
Communication when something’s went wrong or felt wrong can be hard to 
articulate to others  
Time can be a major challenge during a race, in terms of how many laps to go 
and how many more moves forward you can make 
Difficult to anticipate when something’s going to happen

Heat and Feature Races 
Lining up for feature races and how heat races work for placement 
Continued discussion of track changes when it gets dark, and impact on tires 
Looking at the track before the feature, if there’s a break, but not always being 
able to tell until out on it

Importance of sponsors to kart racing 
Racing being an expensive ‘hobby’ and sponsors help fund/cover the cost

Memories and Enjoyment in Racing 
All races good or bad are memorable in some way 
Most important part is time spent with her dad 
Enjoys that kart racing is very competitive, but also is her choice to race or not 
race (unlike school sport where is mandatory) 
Racing against mostly (but not all) guys and older racers  
Karts being neat and manageable, not sure about moving into another class 
Advice would be to stick it out and that it takes time to develop the skills, can’t 
just jump in and be great 
Kart racing is a lot of fun and meet lot of people
