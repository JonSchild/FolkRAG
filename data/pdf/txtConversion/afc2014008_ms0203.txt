To Whom It May Concerns
 
Enclosed is an article we have written entitled The Wicker-
work Hive.
 It describes beekeeping in pre-industrial Greece and
 
concentrates on the hive demonstrated by Mr. George Kodros at the
 
1975 Festival of American Folklife.
 An example of the hive has
 
been contributed to the Smithsonian Museum of History and Tech-
nology, Department of Agriculture.
 Craig Kodros, Geroge's son,
 
was also a participant and assisted his father in the demonstra-
tion.
 Material for the article came mainly from Mr. Kodros and
 
was supplemented by library research.
 Though it is not widely
 
known,  this particular process- is important to the history of
 
modern beekeeping.
 Since it is being replaced by more modern
 
methods, a study is essential at this time.
 
Craig Ernest Kodros has just received his B.A. from the
 
University of California at Berkeley, with a major in '
Biology.
 
He has researched crop introduction and assisted an agricultural
 
consultant at the University of California, Davis.
 His biolo-
gical knowledge of bees proved helpful in writing this article.
 
His main interests are photography and nature study.
 Currently
 
he is writing another article on an environmental issue.
 He
 
plans to teach Biology.
 
I have just graduated from the University of California,
 
Berkeley,  Phi Beta Kappa, with a major in English.
 I writeff
,
)oetry
 
and have been published in the Berkeley Poetry Review. 
One of
 
my outside interests in anthropology, and I participated in an
 
archeological dig in Nevada.
 At present,  I am co--authoring ano-
ther article with Craig.
 My plans include teaching English as a
 
second language.
 
We appreciate your reviewing our article.
 We have enclosed
 
a drawing, along with photographs of the Festival of American
 
Folklife.
 The collection of the Festival of American Folklife,
 
Division of Performing Arts of the Smithsonian, should also con-
tain some excellent photos of the hive.
 Enclosed is a self-

THE WICKERWORK HIVE
 
by
 Lisa Lethin
 
and
 
C. Ernest Kodros
 
From the island of Andros,  Greece, as well as from ogler
 
parts of the Mediterranean,comes a technique of beekeeping dating
 
back thousands of years.
 The process is simple and effective,
 
making it possible to continually harvest honey from the same hive.
 
This type of hive has its roots in ancient Egypt, and the harvest-
ing of honey dates back even further.
 
Man has probably used honey since he was a hunter and gatherer
 
by. , robbing the hives of wild bees.
 Our oldest evidence dates back
 
to the Paleolithic.
 In the Cuevas de la Arana in Valencia,  Spain,
 
a rock painting 15,000 years old shows two men gathering honeycomb
 
and depositing it into a container.
 
As man began to domesticate plants and animals, he subsequently
 
cultivated bees for their honey production.
 Man's earliest records
 
include involved descriptions of beekeeping.
 In Egypt, as early as
 
the lst Dynasty (3100 b.c.),  the symbol of the bee was associated
 
with royal power.
 Throughout Egypt's history, honey was important
 
both as a confection and a medicine.
 In the solar temple of
 
Ne-user-re at Abu Ghorab, a wall painting depicts the various steps
 
involved in keeping bees and processing honey.
 Horizontal pottery
 
cylinders and reed hives covered with dung were both used.  An
 
ancient Egyptian writing states that "more pleasant is the honey-
hive from the dirt, which.is dung, with its larger honeycomb than
 
the hive made of stone  (pottery)!"  Perhaps this is why the reed
 
hive is still in common use in Upper Egypt today.
 
Although Egypt provides the first written records of bee-
-2-
keeping. the practice developed quite early in other parts of
 
the Mediterranean,
 As Plutarch writes, noting its ancient origins,
 
"Formerly honey was used for libations and it provided beverages
 
(by fermentation) before the vine was discovered."  Greek legends
 
also recognized the profound antiquity of beekeeping,  telling of
 
the goddess, Melissa, who fed honey to Zeus himself as a child.
 
Aristotle and Herodotus were both aware of the varying regional
 
qualities of honey, considering it an important agricultural pro-
duct.
 Synesios of Kyrene,  of post-Classical times, writes,  "Athens
 
no longer has philosophy, but it is renowned for its honey."  From
 
this time, up until the 20th century,  techniques for making honey
 
in the Mediterranean remained virtually unchanged.
 
This type of beekeeping is still practiced by some of the
 
agrarian inhabitants on Andros.
 Prior '
to the recent introduction
 
of the movable-frame hive,  this was the only method used.
 Each
 
family maintained anywhere from ten to twenty hives, distributed
 
throughout their farm and on community grazing land in nearby hills.
 
Honey and wax obtained from these hives were usually kept for family
 
use.
 Since cane sugar was not available, honey was the only sweet-
ening agent used in cooking.
 The wax of the comb was used for
 
making candles.  All surplus honey was stored in clay pots for use
 
during the summer and winter when honey production had stopped.
 
The type of hive used in this beekeeping technique is a wicker-
work basket covered with cow dung.
 This hive has been used for
 
thousands of years in Greece, southern Spain and other parts of the
 
Mediterranean.
 The Greek name for the hive is "Kepsaye" and for
 
the basket with this type of weave,  "Coffini".
 The baskets
 
were constructed during the summer when bees began to reproduce.
 
At this time, branches of the Black Willow (Salix nigra) or Bamboo
 
were gathered for the hive's construction. 1 Men began to weave
 
immediately after gathering.
 If the branches were dried,  they
 
were soaked in water for a day prior to use to increase flexibility.
 
They stripped the branches of leaves and wove there in the following
 
mannerz
 Eight branches, each 2.0 feet long and finch in diameter,
 
were tied into a cone-like structure.
 Next, very thin flexible
 
twigs were woven around the branches in a wickerwork fashion, pro-
ducing a cone-shaped basket with thick walls.
 Two cross bars were
 
placed inside the upper portion, providing a support for the honey-
comb.
 The next step was to cover the basket with cow dung, allow-
ing it to dry for a period of two weeks.
 It was necessary to use
 
fresh dung since remoistened material loses its adhesive nature.
 
After the dung dried, the craftsmen imbedded beeswax in the interior
 
of the hive, making it a more conducive atmosphere for the bees.
 
Bees  (A. mellifera cecropia) were introduced to the hive in
 
late summer when swarming occured,  after the reproductive period. 2 
When the bees were about to swarm, a young boy was usually assigned
 
the task of watching the hive in order to catch the bees.
 Once the
 
swarm left the hive,  the boy followed until the bees landed on the
 
branch of a tree.
 He then cut the branch, with bees attached, and
 
shook the swarm into the inverted hive.
 The hive was immediately

 Black Willow is endemic to the island, while Bamboo was intro-
duced mainly as a wind break around houses.
 
2.
 After reproduction in the bee colony, a portion of the popula-
tion will migrate with a new queen to occupy another site.
 
This is termed "swarming".

covered with clean linen and left alone till night when bees are
 
less active because of the cold.
 Complete with bees, the hive
 
was then placed in a sheltered area, such as a rock outcropping,
 
or was covered with pieces of sheet rock.
 This protected it from
 
rain which could eventually wear down the dung covering.
 Sheet rock
 
was also used as a platform for the hive.  The bees used spaces at
 
the base of the hive for exits, which were small enough to be
 
easily guarded.
 If they were any larger, the wasp, a natural
 
predator, could enter and steal honey.
 
Beehives were distributed according to the availability of
 
pollen and nectar producing plants and the type of honey desired.
 
The most desirable area was in lemon orchards.
 Of secondary pre-
ference was grazing land where wild sage grew.
 
The honey was harvested twice yearly,  once in the spring, and
 
once in the fall after swarming. 1 The farmer smoked the bees away
 
from the hive by placing a clay dish of burning cow dung next to
 
the bees.  About 2/3 of the comb was cut away with a small knife.
 
If one left too little honey,  it would threaten the food supply of
 
the colony.  Too much honey would not necessitate further honey
 
production.
 The keeper then allowed the swarm to return to the
 
hive.
 The advantage of this technique was that the colony was not
 
destroyed.
 This is an important advantage over other pre-industrial
 
hives, such as the European skep, which necessiaaed killing the
 
bees by excessive smoking or the use of sulphur fumes at each har-
vest.
 
1.
 Since reproduction occured mainly in the summer, harvesting did
 
not interfere with the incubation of larvae in the honeycomb.
 
Some destruction of larvae was inevitable, but this kept the
 
swarm from becoming too large for the hive's capacity.
 
-
5-
Once the comb was harvested, it was hand-pressed and collected
 
unfiltered. The wax was washed and made into candles.  The honey
 
was stored in clay jars and used throughout the season.  A
. single
 
farm might collect between ten and twenty gallons of honey yearly.
 
During the winter months, when bees were unable to forge
 
because of cold temperatures (below 57' F), the c6lony of bees
 
would overwinter.  Honey and water were given to the bees at this
 
time to insure the colony's food supply.  This was simply placed.
 
in a bowl at the opening of the hive.
 By practicing this technique,
 
a hive could be active for a period of over ten years.
 
With the wickerwork hive, these agrarian people produced honey
 
using nothing more than a knife and the resources around them.
 
Today the craft is used sporadically in the Mediterranean, Confined
 
largely to isolated rural areas.  Although less effective than the
 
movable-frame hive, this older method provided the necessary back-
ground for its development.
 In the late 1700's, a group of European
 
scientists travelled to Greece to study beekeeping.  They discovered
 
the wickerwork hive, which was more efficient than the skep being
 
used in Europe at that time.  From their findings, they developed
 
the box hive, forerunner of the movable-frame hire.
 This Greek
 
technique is unfamiliar to many historians, but it was an essential
 
step in the development of beekeeping.

 have a

Wilner's book i
s
 o
f a
 t
ype t
hat
 
university presses once c
alled "pure
 
t
obacco." F
ifty y
ears ago, when a
 
number o
f d
irectors o
f s
cholarly
 
presses c
oined t
hat phrase, i
t
 was
 
possible t
o s
peak o
f publishing
 
s
cholarly books t
hat had no c
om-
mercial potential. For t
he r
ecord,
 
t
hat r
emains t
he f
unction o
f t
he
 
university p
ress. But i
t
 i
s
 t
he r
are
 
publisher who c
an now a
fford pure
 
t
obacco.
 
One o
f t
he r
easons f
or t
hat i
s
 
t
hat universities a
re i
ncreasingly
 
unable o
r unwilling t
o a

he
 
ongoing obligation t
hey have t
o
 
s
cholarly presses, many o
f which
 
a
re now r
equired t
o b
reak e
ven.
 
Another part o
f t
he problem i
s
 
t
hat quality has become c
onfused
 
with s
ize and public image, among
 
university administrators a
s well
 
a
s i
n t
he minds o
f t
he publishers.
 
Today's university presses have
 
t
o hustle f
or money and r
ecogni-
t
ion. They a
re i
ncreasingly i
n
 
positions s
imilar t
o t
hat o
f a

 s
oup
 
c
ompany. Ten s
taff members have
 
t
o do t
he work o
f 1

hey
 
a
re "
committed t
o publishing."
 
And because t
he number o
f t
i
tles
 
produced has t
o i
ncrease, many
 
p
resses a

The publisher a

and s
t

he b
reeding
 
g
round f
or h
is r

t
he changes will have t
o come f

The people running university
 
presses a
re i
ntelligent and t
alented.
 
They meet once a

The t

am t

f
e s

ontinued until I
 was about

t which t

 l
eft Baltimore.
 
Twenty y
ears l

 was v
isiting
 
my g
randmother i
n Baltimore and s
he
 
pointed out one o
f my c
hildhood
 
f
r
iends who was s
t
ill Arabing. I
 be-
c
ame c
urious about how many guys
 
were s
t
ill a
round Arabing, o
r doing
 
anything on horse-and-wagons. By t
his
 
t
ime, I
 had b
ecome a

ree-lance
 
photographer and was developing a
 
s
trong i

Going f

 was s
urprised t
o f
ind
 
t
hat t
hey had a
lmost nothing a
t a

Arabers and hawkers, which was my
 
f
i
rst c
lue a
s t
o how t
hese men were
 
v
iewed by t
he dominant c
ulture i
n
 
Baltimore. Turning t

I
 f
ound t

arried many c
olorful
 
a

I
 a

ef
lected a
 d
esire by t
he g
eneral public
 
t
o g
et r
id o
f t
he horse-and-wagons
 
a
ltogether. I
 was d
isturbed, and ang-
e
red t
oo, f
or I
 had many happy
 
memories o
f warm s
ummer days when
 
t
he music o
f t
he Arabers f
i
lled t
he a
ir
 
and t
here s
eemed t
o be hawkers o
f
 
e
very description e
verywhere.
 
Through f
urther i
nvestigation, I
 
f
ound t
hat t
here s
eems t
o be a
 g
eneral
 
c
onsensus t
hat, not only a
re t

unsanitary, but t
hat most people

re v
iewed
 
a
s an uncomfortably v
isible part o
f t
he
 
welfare c

t a
 dead end.
 
Again, t
his bothers me. Even t

Once upon a t

 boy named J
ack l
ived a

with h
is mother! That v

hould g

t
o anyone with a p

s o
ften portrayed a
s missing o
r
 
d
ead —which a
llows t
he boy t
o be "
alone w
ith h
is
 
mother." (
In g
irl-centered f
airy t

he mother i
s
 
s
imilarly missing o
r d
eceased which a
llows t
he g
irl t
o
 
b
e a
lone w
ith her f
ather.)
 
Jack l
ived
 
a
lone with h
is mother!
 
As most w
ill r
emember, J
ack t
rades h
is milk-giving
 
c
ow t
o an o
ld man who g
ives h
im s
ome beans i
n e

c
hange. At t
he s
ight o
f t
he beans, Jack's mother i
n-
s
i
sts t
hat he t
hrow t
hem out t
he window. (
I s
hall
 
r
efrain f
rom c
ommenting on e
ach and e
very s
ymbol.)
 
The next day, a
 huge beanstalk i
s d
iscovered. J
ack's
 
mother begs h
im not t
o c
l
imb i
t
, but he d
isobeys.
 
Up i
n t
he b
eanstalk world, t
here i
s a c
annibalistic
 
g
iant who o
ften i
n s
ome v
ague way i
s l
inked with
 
J
ack's f
ather —e.g., t
he g
iant a
llegedly s
tole J
ack's
 
f
ather's t
reasures. Fortunately, s
omeone up t
here helps
 
J
ack: I
t i
s Mrs. Giant. Did i
t
 e
ver s
trike you a
s s
ome-
what peculiar t
hat Mrs. Giant would help a t
otal
 
s
tranger, a y
oung boy, t
aking s
ides a
gainst her own
 
husband?  (
In t
his Oedipal p
rojection, t
he upper
 
world i
s an e

f t
he l
ower one.) And i
t may
 
a
lso be worth r
ecalling where Mrs. Giant h
ides J
ack
 
—it i
s
 i
n her oven. (The s
ymbolism o
f ovens i
n Euro-
p
ean f

s g
enerally quite c

I
n any e
vent, t
he s
tupid o
ld g
iant f
ails t
o s
ee J
ack
 
h
iding i
n h
is wife's oven. F
inally, J

ushes down
 
t

he g

p
ens, down a

f t
he beanstalk, waiting
 
w

s
 J
ack's mother. Taking
 
he hatchet, J
ack c

he s

auses
 
t
he death o
f t
he g
iant, and t
he s
tory ends with J
ack
 
l
iving happily e
ver a

Surely t

His c

Even t

"never t

But a

He was f

One episode i
n t
his r
egard s
tands out
 
i
n my aging mind. When we were uncer-
t
ain a
s t
o what horses t
o bet on, we c
ould
 
a
lways buy a t
ip. One f
ine s
pring c
lay a

or t

hird y
ear i

t
he most important t
est o
f our s
tudent
 
c
areer, no word '
 had been r
eceived. S
o,
 
g
loomily, we began t
he examination. Sud-
denly a s
econd y
ear s
tudent e
ntered t
he
 
r
oom, approached t
he i
nstructor who was
 
i
n c

ellow missive,
 
s
aid i
n t
ones audible t
o a

econd y
ear s

F

ince become known a
s
 
an outstanding professor o

I marched out t

 opened t

phoned i
n a bet and, with a s
igh o
f r
e-
l
ief, r
esumed my p
lace i
n t
he c
lassroom.
 
The  denouement  was  anticlimactic —
 
t
he w
ire had g
iven two horses, s
o I bet
 
an equal amount on both. One, y
clept
 
S

t e

Dear Ms. Hawes;
 
Thank you for your kind letter of  13 November
 
1975.
 Enclosed you will find a study guide for the film
 
"Los Vendidos."
 Tnere are still plans to eApand the guide
 
into a discussion manual which will include the guide along
 
with the entire T.V. script and a resource reading list.
 
Thank you for your endorsement of the film
 
and for having shown it at your festival this past summer.
 
I look forward to hearing from you again.

STUDY QUESTIONS FOR THE FILM "LOS VENDIDOS" BY
  
EL '
1
'
E
;ATR0 CAMPESINO
  
(Teachers please notes  Due to the nature of this film, the ques-
tions seem to be aimed at students who are familiar with the Chicano; i
.e.
 
who have lived or are living in areas where concentrations of Chicanos are
 
evident.  Because this film may be shown in any part of the United States,
 
however, we have attempted to include questions which anyone, whether fa-
miliar with the Chicano or not, might answer.  If you and your students
 
are not familiar with Chicano history and literature, many anthologies
 
and histories are available and might constitute an interesting unit for
 
your students.)
 
If you are from the Southwest or any area where there are centers
 
of Chicano population, do you feel that this acto represented the kinds
 
of Chicanos whom you are familiar with?  Were there any characters who
 
you thought were not representative of what you consider to be Chicanos
 
or Mexican Americans?  Were the characters real?  Are there any other
 
types of Mexicans, Chicanos or Mexican Americans who you would have in-
cluded in the acto?
 
The acto opens with calaveras (
skeletons) dancing and singing.
 
Why do you think the Teatro employs these symbols of "death?"  Is the
 
Mexican or Chicano attitude towards death different from that of North
 
American  Anglo society?
 
A reproduction of the Aztec "Calendar Stone" and of a Mayan
 
pyramid are very strong visual symbols in the opening of the acto.  Do
 
you think these Precolumbian images are important to the Chicano today?
 
Why would a contemporary Chicano acto use Precolumbian music and images?
 
The female and male "Diablos" (
"Devils") tell us that we are
 
going to be presented with the Seven Deadly Sins in this acto. What are
 
the Seven De,-
01y Sins, and how are they manifested in the acto? In other
 
words, how do these sins show up in the acto?
 
"
Sancho" tells us that he used to be a farm labor contractor
 
before he became a businessman.  What is a farm labor contractor, and what
 
is his relationship to the f
 armworkers?  Would you like to be a farm labor
 
contractor?

Is "Miss Jiminez" a Chicana, Mexican American, Mexican, Spanish,
 
or Hawaiian?  What reveals her character?  Why does she pronounce her
 
name "
jimmie-nez?"  Does she speak Spanish?  Does she understand Spanish?
 
A f
 armworker family is shown in the back of a truck.  Is this
 
where they live?  How do you suppose migrant families live?  What kind of
 
schooling would the children of campesinos (
f
 armworkers) get?  Would you
 
like to be a campesino?
 
As you noted, the language in this acto is bilinguals Spanish
 
and English, with a few "pochismos" (
literall
 
: language of the pochos, 
a term used by Mexicans to designate Chicanos  thrown-in for local color.
 
Did you understand the language?  If you are not Chicano, but have studied
 
Spanish in school, did you understand all of the non-English dialogue?  If
 
not, can you explain this?
 
Why do you suppose Chicano Theatre is always bilingual?  Do you
 
think this limits the audience that will totally comprehend an acto? Would
 
you prefer to have the characters communicating totally in English?  How
 
would this affect the characterizations?
 
As an example of his bilinguality, "Johnny Pachuco" says: "You
 
dirty mother . . . . " and is quickly interrupted by "Miss Jiminez's"
 
screams of protest.  Why do you suppose the playwright has this character
 
talking like this?
 
What are the characteristics of the pachuco as seen in "
Johnny,"
 
the vato loco and the "zootsuiter?" If you are familiar with this type of
 
Chicano, do you agree with the way they are presented in this acto?  How
 
might you change them?  What is your feeling about pachucos: why do we find
 
this type in the barrios?
 
For a special research project, look-up the famous "Zootsuit Riots"
 
of the 40's and write a report about them.
 (
Note: you won't find too much
 
information in your local high school history text
 
What does "
Sancho" mean when he says that pachucos make such good
 
"scapegoats?"  Can you think of ways in which this happens?
 
"Miss Jiminez" tells "Sancho" that the "Revolucionaxio" is "un-
American."  Is he?  Do you agree with her that to be American you must be
 
born in the United States?
 
"Eric Garcia" represents a "Mexican-American" in the acto. Do
 
you think the playwright likes "Eric's" type?  How does the playwright re-
veal his attitudes towards Mexican-Americans?  Do you consider yourself to
 
be Mexican-American?  What are the differences between Mexicans, Mexican-
Americans, and Chicanos?
 
When "Eric" speaks Spanish, "
Sancho" tells "Miss Jiminez" that he
 
is talking about his pride in his heritage, etc.  Is he?  What does "Eric"
 
really say, and why?
 
The scientist, dressed as a Mexican peon, says: "According to the
 
map, we've got Chicanos infiltrating every major urban center in the country."
 
Why do you suppose these people are placing Chicanos in these cities?  What
 
do you think will happen in the future?  What would you like to see happen?
 
a
 
"L0S VENDIDOS" page 3
.
 
Why is "Los Vendidos" an acto rather than a play?  Did you find
 
any differences between this acto and a play which you have seen performed
 
on stage and television?  Have you ever seen another acto, produced by
 
El Teatro Campesino or any other Chicano theatre troupe?  If so, how did
 
this acto differ from what you saw?
 
Originally written for any kind of acting area, "Los Vendidos"
 
has been produced by many different teatros (
Chicano theatre groups)
 
throughout the United States.  If you were going to produce this acto, 
how would you change it?  How would the production have to differ from
 
the movie? (
For a copy of the original acto, see Luis Valdez, Actos, 
published by Cucaracha Publications, P.O. Box 1278, San Juan Bautista,
 
California 9
5045, $
3.00.)
 
There is much comedy in this acto, some within the script and
 
some within the action of the characters.  What part of the acto was fun-
niest to you and why?  Did any part of the acto seem serious to you? Why?
 
Music is very important in the opening and closing of the pro-
duction.  Can you describe the music and what it meant to the overall
 
production?  Did the music enhance the presentation?  Were the tunes
 
familiar to you?  Would they be familiar to a Chicano audience?
 
When this production was telecast, it was aired in Los Angeles,
 
California and Chicago,Illinois.  Why do you suppose these two urban
 
centers were chosen?  Would you show this program in Memphis, Tennessee?
 
Do you think this program could be telecast nation-wide?  If it were,
 
would there be any repercussions?
 
What impressed you the most about this production?  What didn't
 
you like about it? In both cases, explain your reasons.

Our music was enthusiastically received by t
he t
housands o
f t
ourists who came t
o D.C. f
or
 
t
his 9
th Annual Folklife Festival.  Many sat i
n t
he audience with t
ears i
n t
heir eyes as our songs
 
t
ouched t
heir hearts.  We heard so many com ments, asking "Where are you f
ro m?" -
 "
I' ve never
 
h
eard such beautiful music before." -
 "You not only s
ing l
ike angels, you l
ook l
ike angels." The
 
Washington Post, July 5
, 1
975 s
tated "
... The Molokans, a
 Russian Protestant sect, are a
 surprise
 
t
o even some o
f t
he Californians present..." Many asked where t
hey could buy t
apes or records o
f
 
our music.  Of course, we made none available a
s we d
id not want our songs co mmercialized.
 
I
 
Our group l
ooked beautiful -
 our outfits and shirts i
dentified us as Russian Molokans and
 
a
ttracted everyone.  We s
tood out as a
 c
lean, wholeso me group.  S
o many were surprised t
hat we
 
a
lways dress f
or our church f
unctions i

his t
ype o
f c
lothing.  Many wanted t
o know what our
 
preachers wore -
 i
f i
t
 was anything d
ifferent -
 and were surprised t
hat t
hey dressed l
ike everyone
 
e
lse -
 t
hat no one i
s d
ifferent i
n our churches.  They were impressed with t
he f
act t
hat we have no
 
written music -
 t
hat our melodies are handed down f
rom generation t
o generation.
 
The S
ingers s
tood up on s
tage so proudly, men on t
he l
eft and wo men on t
he r

would com ment briefly on t

he meaning o
f t

 he announced who would s
tart t

song (
their name i

 and t
hen our Molokan S

with such beauty and such f

 and i

t t
ouched t

We s

Jack Pavloff, our Director, d

ob o
f s
electing t

t

hat were t
oo l
engthy, arranging the programs t
o have a
 variety o
f songs each day, and
 
especially bringing out t
he best i
n each s
inger so t
hat our Russian Molokan music was presented i
n
 
our t
ypical Russian peasant-style har mony and melody.  At t
his point we t
hank Kate Chernekoff who
 
put t
ogether special song books f
or u
s t
o t
ake back t
o t
he Festival.
 
Many t
imes t
he audience would applaud when t
hey heard Jack say t
hat t
his was t
he f
irst t
ime i
n
 
70 years s
ince our arrival i
n t
he United S

hat Molokan music has been presented out o
f t
he
 
confines o
f our co mmunity i
n Los Angeles.  They were delighted t
hat t
hey had t
he opportunity t
o
 
enjoy our music on such a
 h
istoric occasion and were happy t
hat we had a
ccepted t
he i
nvitation t
o
 
come t
o Washington, D. C
. and perform a
t t
his Festival.  A v
isitor f
ro m I
reland was so impressed
 
by our s
inging and said he never heard any music such as our Molokan music.  He wanted t
o know
 
3
 
so much more about t
he Molokans and we autographed a
 copy o
f "Molokans i
n America" t
hat he
 
bought t
o t
ake back t
o I
reland with h

autographed copies o
f t

We t
hank Annie Orloff Sobolew and W m. G. Klubnikin f

brass samovars f

Alex John Orloff and J

ictures o
f t

They t
hought we brewed t
ea i

i

 and l

t

hey re me mbered t
heir grandfather or grand mother drinking t
ea out o
f g
lasses and
 
saucers as we Molokans do.  I
t was a
 nostalgic t
rip f
or many who came t
o v
isit with us.  We
 
enlarged and d
isplayed Vera Sa marin' s
 poe m about drinking Tea Molokan S
tyle (
fro m t

Molokan cookbook) and Noreen S
tupin painted a
 p
icture o

 g
lasses with a
 bridge o

our chi booth when t

They a

nterested i

when he read t
he Molokans were going t

s
 
s

hat i
t re minded h

f childhood
 
experiences i

hanked u
s f
or our marvelous contribution t
o t

gave an unscheduled, impromptu performance f

rom Roosevelt High S

951.
 
As we sang f
or her a
 huge crowd gathered and i

inging.  One woman made
 
a
 special t
rip t
o bring her Ger man Mennonite uarents f
ro m Pennsylvania t

and s

s
 
again as t
hey re me mbered us f
ro m Russia.  They v
isited a
t l
ength with t

anded i
n Washington, D. C
. aboard our chartered f
light, our s
ingers sang
 
S
lava (Praise t
o God) and i
t was so meaningful and beautiful.  Later a
 young man who was one o
f t
he
 
California perfor mers came up t
o me and said "My mother i

f
or His goodness i

his possible -
 f
or u
s t
o share our Russian Molokan musical heritage and
 
making o

I
t was an i
nteresting and e
ducational experience f
or everyone -
 t
o see how o

till s
trive
 
t
o maintain t
heir cultural and e
thnic backgrounds j

How d

Research Center, Berkeley, Calif. who has been gathering material on Russian Molokans f
or many
 
years.  Ethel and S

he Molokans will be called "A Kingdo m within a
 City."
 
She wanted more i
nfor mation on our music and Moses Volkoff sang a
 s
election o
f songs f
or her on
 
t
ape.  Mrs. Dunn sent t
his t

one o
f t
he world' s
 f
ore most authorities on f

European and Georgian music.  He was so impressed with our Molokan music and we quote f
ro m
 
one o
f h
is l
etters t
o Mrs. Dunn, "
In conclusion, t
he Molokan repetory embraces many o

I

I
