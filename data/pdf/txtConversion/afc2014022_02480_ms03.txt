Introduction 
00:00:31-00:13:00 
Born in Philadelphia, first generation from India. Family in India has long 
agrarian roots, grandfather had mango and sapodilla farm that family still 
owns. Grew up in urban Philly. Went to school in Colorado, where real 
introduction to agriculture started. Studied environmental science, but 
didn’t know what she wanted to do until introduced to one of largest 
organic farms in earl 1990s. Became acquainted with farming community, 
and community attracted her. Production fascinated her, worked on several 
CSA farms out west. One was transformative, CSA farm in mid-1990s that 
had been organic since 1945. Was Seventh Day Adventist community, 
served 250 CSA members, owners passionate about ecological building and 
permaculture. Also had interest in advocacy and social justice, and organic 
standards getting written in 1990s also influenced her place in agriculture. 
Also spent time in 1990s in California fruit production, mostly produce, 
doesn’t have experience in livestock or dairy. Came back to east coast, got 
job at Shelburne Farms to manage their market garden. Was introduced to

dairy, cheese production, and Vermont style of farming which was very 
different than larger farms in Colorado and different climate. Worked at 
Shelburne for year, then became Produce Manager at Healthy Living to 
understand marketing aspect. Knew she wanted to work with food, knew 
production but wanted to work with marketing. Worked there 6 years, and 
concurrently started farm in Intervale with friend to sell at BFM and local 
restaurants. Mid mid-2000s stopped farming, left Healthy Living, went to 
get MS in Environmental Law and Food Policy at VT Law School to round 
out knowledge of food policy. Came back to Intervale as administrator, 
mostly business planning with farmers. Intervale had just received grant to 
start Food Hub, started building that business. Moved back east mainly to 
see family because they still lived in Philly. Got one year internship at 
Shelburne, decided not to leave. Fascinated by Intervale program, 
fascinated by farming in the northeast. Didn’t learn how to farm in school, 
first mentor in Colorado at Sunrise CSA and Gardens. Taught Sona steps of 
production, was more than internship. In VT, a lot of peer learning in 
Intervale. Worked with Andy Jones, Diggers Mirth, many others in Intervale 
community. All had different farm business and farming held different roles 
to individuals. VT Law School significant in one teacher’s heavy involvement 
in sustainable agriculture issues, opened issues of farming policy, was also 
big mentor. Intervale teaches her a lot as well, farmers on a daily basis, staff 
has been there for 8+ years and work as team. 
00:13:00-00:17:36 
When actively farming, aspiration was to be a farmer full time, the American 
Dream. Never farmed full time, held full time job at Healthy Living, intention 
was taking a few years to try farming out. After 3 years, wasn’t viable given 
circumstances without huge capital investment. As two separate friends 
supporting two individual lives was difficult, and Vermont land prices were 
fairly high and access to land difficult. Loved farming, but slowly realizing 
reality of it, shaping future in her involvement in agriculture. “This is always

going to be a part of me, I need to grow food in some way, I need to be 
around food production. I believe food production is one of the most 
amazing occupations or contributions to the world.” But contribution to 
food systems changed. Bittersweet to have the shift, not physically farming 
but supporting other doing it knowing how challenging and joyful it is. 
“Farming is such a part of your life, it’s your identity, and when you realize 
that that’s not what you can do for your occupation, it’s like part of your 
identity that is lost.” Get over that feeling with time, still feels like 
contributing in meaningful way. 
00:17:36-00:24:00 
Took time for family to understand her choice of career. Wanted to follow 
American Dream, parents wanted her to make money, have highly 
respected job, get married, buy land, parents worked hard to make that 
happen. Had personal struggles over the years over choices she made, but 
parents came around. Took 10 years, not until early 30s until they 
understood and respected her choices but still push her about working for 
higher positions occasionally. But they are also proud that she has 
maintained agrarian tradition in family, parents have become more 
involved with food production, meeting farmers, slowing down to 
appreciate food. “I think food and farming and our connection to the land is 
what is transformative for me and for the whole world. I think the more that 
we can tap into the food and the land, the more we are able to tap into the 
true essence of our beings, and be happy.” Has 2 older and 1 younger 
brother. They followed more traditional path, Dad has very high 
expectations. Have all taken own path, but now starting to converge in 
career paths somewhat. Get much creative freedom and can manifest 
change at Intervale more than in government position. To parents, not all 
about material possessions, more lack of understanding about where 
change can happen and things positions in higher power are more 
influential, but not always so.

Never had fully romanticized view of farming, knew it was demanding, low 
pay, but also knew joys of farming. Owning own business and being in 
charge of sales and financial goals was first introduction to reality of 
farming. Working 80 hours/week with incredibly low food prices. Then 
realized that would not change, that growing more food and selling more 
food means more expenses and not increased revenue. Also have to deal 
with climate of food production and policy changing very slowly with large-
scale producers and modern food system. Need to balance personal and 
professional, short and long-term goals.

At Intervale Center title is Intervale Food Hub Manager. Mostly manage food 
hub enterprise, is really market development for Intervale Center looking 
for new markets for local producers. Consumer education is key to this, 
access doesn’t mean utilization or sales. Food hub is a lot of things, in 
general concept is old. One of defining principles is bringing together 
multiple producers to leverage efficiency in food distribution. Could be 
aggregation, storage, distribution, marketing, retail, processing. Could be 
any of supply chain functions from field to table. Takes on many different 
forms. Deep Root Co-op has been doing this for 30-40 years. Modern 
renaissance of food hubs is response to desire for more models and co-ops 
and producers to bring farmers together and create more decentralized 
model of food distribution. Can be direct to consumer, wholesale, steps of 
production. Other defining feature is values-based value chain. Start with 
producer and meeting their needs/values, make sure those value are being 
incorporated at every level of supply chain.

Intervale Food Hub is direct to consumer hub. Aggregate, market, and 
distribute local farm products to community directly to consumers. Do wide 
variety of producers, produce, meat, eggs, value added, all contributing to 
VT economy. Product goes directly to individuals through central pickup 
locations in community. Now starting to go into wholesale as well. Using

logistics from existing model, working to serve Sodexo at University of 
Vermont and other colleges. Will be first entryway into larger wholesale 
distribution, but primarily direct to consumer aggregator and distributor. 
00:34:45-00:39:41 
Intervale Food Hub does not want to take away CSA customers. Since 
started in 2008, want to open new market and bring new people into local 
food movement. Chose workplaces first because individual farms weren’t 
reaching out to them. Maintained subscription model like CSA because 
allows guaranteed sales and markets for farmers. Has been tricky to 
distinguish from CSA, but different because not taking on risk of single farm, 
drawing from several producers and will get what you paid for. Ingredients 
also carefully chosen because buying them in, are not producers 
themselves. This model helps producers financially with new market. Also 
offer service of new customers, do annual surveys of participants and in 
first few years 80% of customers were new to local food movement. Now, 
about 40% customers stay, 50% new to local food movement in general, 
10% displacement. Consumer education and creating larger cultural shift 
towards local food movement are key. As non-profit, able to spend more 
time providing higher level of customer service and outreach/resources to 
help get members engaged. Farms don’t have margins to do extra work, so 
Food Hub can help prioritize those services.

Food Hub wants to turn a profit as a business. Currently business covers 
operation costs and half of overhead, so moving in desired direction. If were 
for-profit, ideal would be to cover all operations and assets, so halfway 
covering depreciation. Should reach goal within year, then can spend more 
to reinvest in business. Profit would be reinvested back into business, and if 
have large success could do profit sharing or other models, but not there 
yet. Not a lot of money in food distribution. Food Hub income is a general 
Intervale allocation, get an annual budget but want the business to be 
profitable like it were a standalone. Currently operating at about $600,000

cost of production. Can make money by squeezing people out, but not the 
intention and don’t want to lose money. Intervale Center sees a lot of value 
in business as critical to all of Intervale work, involved business planning 
with their farmers to meet the market demand, community outreach. Being 
on ground managing business is their strength. Want business to pay its 
way and be sustainable over time, currently still volatile. Hard to fundraise, 
don’t need as much now but critical to being non-profit to serve community.  
00:45:35-00:55:34 
One of biggest challenges for food hubs is farmer buy in. Fortunately, didn’t 
have that problem when started, partly because Sona had preexisting 
relations with farmers as peer and as buyer at Healthy Living. Trust was 
there because had been buying food from farmers for years, would have 
been greater challenge if relationships hadn’t existed. Other advantage 
starting out was emerging rom Intervale Center which also had history of 
supporting VT farmers. With lots of food hubs starting across state, having 
history and reputation was helpful. Original premise for 2007 grant was for 
food hub to be farmer-owned business, writing business plan themselves. 
Immediately realized not possible, farmers are too busy producing food to 
write business plan. Still want it to be farmer-driven and participator, key to 
business today to support farmers’ businesses. Great working relationships 
with their farmers, learn from one another. Have naturally grown 
relationships together keeping farmers’ interests in mind. Started with 300-
producer survey in Chittenden and 5 adjacent counties, excluding fluid milk, 
asking about production, markets, goals, needs, sales. Had several informal 
meetings to develop core group of 30-40 farmers, after a few years had 
clear commitments from farmers and reached out to round out products. 
Core group gains more than loses producers, people who leave either no 
longer farming or completely changing business model. Still steadily 
growing, but demand no longer outpacing supply, now it’s about longer-
term cultural shifts.

Pay farmers prices comparable to local wholesale rate, similar to City 
Market or Healthy Living. Farm gate prices (selling at farm stand, farmers 
markets, CSA) slightly higher, but food hub gives wholesale market rate. 
Local rate generally higher than Black River Produce, they are susceptible to 
national market rate and often work with Boston market prices. Sodexo 
doesn’t want to buy directly from farmers, wants to provide more local 
food. Signed new contract with University of Vermont, Real Food Challenge, 
pressure to improve. Challenge is costly for them and for producers to 
become approved vendors, so to overcome this, Sodexo tells producers to 
go through Black River Produce because they are already approved vendor. 
Some individual producers have become direct approved vendors, example 
Champlain Orchards, and once those systems in place much easier to 
maintain business, but most producers have to go through intermediary 
markets. Intervale has been building relationship with Sodexo for 8 years, 
Intervale Food Hub now approved vendor and will start selling summer 
2015. Intervale can meet requirements and certifications on behalf of 
producers to give producers access to Sodexo through Intervale Food Hub. 
Price Sodexo pays is lower than price consumer pays through Intervale 
Food Hub’s model. Price Food Hub pays to farmers trying to maintain the 
same, currently in transparent negotiations. Will allow Food Hub to serve 
more farmers and increase local food market, but still need to define 
parameters of business offered by Food Hub. Very easy for producers to ask 
Food Hub to be distributor, but not the only/total identity of Food Hub. 
Want to be clear in defining unique relationship while differentiating from 
Black River Produce and other distributors. Food Hub maintains full 
traceability and transparency in their products, about individual farms’ 
brands and not the Intervale brand. Back River very valuable, but Food Hub 
is different. Black River probably gives lower prices, but Intervale doesn’t 
want to compete for the market. Intervale does not anticipate impacting

Sodexo’s sales from Black River, could increase sales from both vendors, but 
Intervale may charge slightly more. Sodexo sees value in students’ desires 
for more local food and in forging relationships with local brands and 
producers, University of Vermont asking for this as well.

Food Hub still distributing through work places and civic centers, ho home 
delivery. Started as work places only, wanted to show that business have 
role in impacting Vermont economy and agriculture. Have had to cultivate 
more of local food culture among business leadership and among 
employees. Now, broadened to community. Retail is about building local 
food culture at work, school, community, home. Businesses slightly easier 
because started Food Hub in 2008 in poor economy and was challenging for 
workplaces to retain employees with productive work environment and 
happy employees. Huge incentive for businesses to create wellness 
programs and have benefits for gyms and food, so had advantages starting 
business then. Easy for business, Intervale does logistics, just need 
businesses to be champions of it and to encourage employee participation. 
Hard part is keeping businesses engaged with outreach and keeping 
employees as customers. Employees pay for their own shares, some 
businesses provide incentives and subsidies to encourage participation, 
Intervale supports that. So far, it’s working. Biggest challenge was 
expanding marketing from businesses to greater community, couldn’t rely 
on businesses to rely on marketing. Have shifted to more public locations to 
influence community with retail. Curious to see business evolve in near 
future and next steps with opening new markets in community.
