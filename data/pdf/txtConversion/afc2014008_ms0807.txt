Jan
.uaty 11, 1996
 
It was a pleasure to have the opportunity to meet with you all in
 
New York this past Friday. 
I felt we made some good progress in
 
identifying steps we need to take, in order to begin to realize
 
this long-discussed project.
 
One of  the  things  which  I had  offered to  do was to prepare a
 
listing of all - of the possible projects which Alan had mentioned
 
to me over time. 
I will enclose that with this letter.
 
Separately, Marian & I have sent you our new catalog, a video about
 
Rounder,  and a couple of other items which we thought it migh t be
 
good for you to have.
 
We will also prepare a suggested possible release schedule for your
 
There is one other matter which we volunteered to do,  and that is
 
to recommend a New York based sound engineer who would be good to
 
undertake the editing and preparation work on the various albums,
 
working with  the original  tapes  and  in collaboration  with the
 
editor(s)  you have selected.
 We will come back with a name in a
 
week or so.
 
In order to move forward, it seemed to me that there are a number
 
of decisions you would need to make.
 Please permit me to outline
 
what I think these are:
 
1
)  let Rounder know if you (Anna and Bess)  are content with Jef f Is
 
offer to serve as overall "point person" 
-- someone to facilitate
 
communication with Rounder from your end,  and to "crack the whip"
 
from time to time to keep things progressing.
 We feel this was a
 
very good suggestion,  and would enjoy working with Jeff, but the
 
decision is really Alan's and yours to make.
 
1
11111with .
 an overview of  the  audio
 
comprehensive;  there are certainly other recordings available for
 
future volumes.  Perhaps you might take this listing as a stimulus,
 
or a challenge of sorts,  to ask the question:  what else is there
 
which we might one day like to include?
 
If  I understood correctly,  I believe one  of  you  felt  that  Matt
 
Barton might have such an overview.
 It would not really matter to
 
us at Rounder who this person might be.
 It only seems important
 
that there be someone with this knowledge.
 
3
)  it would be good to have your thoughts on the proposed sequence
 
of releases in our game plan.
 Our recommendations are only that,
 
though these are presented with some thought as to marketing the
 
Lomax Collection as a whole, keeping a balance between the various
 
components.
 In a broader sense, what might work best is simply to
 
release those items which are more easily compiled first.
 
4
)  I think it is also a very good idea,  quite soon,  to designate
 
good people with available time to work on the various series,  or
 
sub-series.
 For want of a better term, we might consider them to
 
be  series  editors.
 You  may  wish  another  terminology,  such  as
 
Series Coordinator or Consultant.  That matters not to us.
 As we
 
all recognize, there are certain people who might be better working
 
on one series than another.
 I believe it was said that Andy Kay,
 
for instance, has a particular forte in Caribbean and world musics.
 
Thus,  he  might  be  a good  coordinator  for  the  12  albums  in Deep
 
River of Song which concentrate on the Windward Islands,  Trinidad,
 
Tobago,  Carriacou,  Grenada,  etc.
 Someone else might be the best
 
person for the New Orleans material.
 
Obviously,  past experience  in working with Alan on the materials
 
at hand would be a plus.
 
5
)
 It  would  be  very  good  to  begin  as  soon  as  we  could  on  a
 
Collection overview.
 I have a number of thoughts here,  based on
 
our discussion in New York.
 I will outline  those  in a separate
 
letter  to  come  along with this  one.
 Putting together a 'press
 
release" of a sort rarely seen in the record business would attract
 
some significant attention to the Collection from its inception and
 
accord  it  a level  of  gravity  that  might  well  help  sales  from
 
inception through the many years to come.
 I think we have a chance
 
to do  something quite  special  here.
 Additionally,  I think the
 
effort involved will pay off for us in many other ways, as it will
 
give all of us an overview and the experience of collaborating on
 
the  development  of  that  overview.
 It  will  also  give  Alan  the
 
opportunity to comment on each series,  even those which might not
 
be released for five year or more into the future.
 
Let me close now,  and get  to the other items  I have promised to
 
send along with this letter.
 I will add that all of us at Rounder
 
are  honored,
 and  excited,
 to  be  able  to  work  on  the  Lomax
 
Collection and we believe we can all join to create a presentation
 
of which we will all be quite proud.
 
Best,
 
THE LOMAX COLLECTION
 
Launch presentation / press release possibilities
 
As  we  began  to  discuss  in  the  2/9/96  meeting  in  New  York,  the
 
actual announcement  and launch of the Collection is  an important
 
moment.
 If possible,  we would like  to have  the  first  releases
 
ready by October of 1996,  and to be able at that time to announce
 
specific  dates  for  at  least  the  next  series  or  two  which would
 
follow the initial releases.
 
A standard press release is in order,  of course,  and we would also
 
propose a New York-based event to make the announcement.
 
At times,  Rounder has produced what we have termed a "video press
 
release"  which offers  the recording artist  talking,  performing a
 
song  or  two,
 and  so  forth.
 For  the  release  of  The  Lomax
 
Collection,  the idea of a CD-ROM press release is very appealing.
 
Assuming we are able to have the first series ready by this autumn,
 
a  CD-ROM  press
 release  would  be  quite
 an  unusual
 -
-
 even
 
innnovative -
-
 item.
 
What might we include in such a presentation could include:
 
-
-a written overview of The Lomax Collection,  written as much as
 
possible by Alan himself
 
--a listing of the various  series within the  Collection,  with a
 
promise of others not listed to follow as well.
 
--an initial sequence of series to be released
 
--comments,  again as much as possible by Alan himself,  on each
 
series.
 This could be Alan's opportunity to make a statement
 
on each series of recordings,  some of which would
 
understandably not be actually releaed for some years,  and to
 
do so within the context of his life's work  (which is to say,
 
the Collection as an entity.)
 I envision this as perhaps 1000
 
words on each series.
 These introductions could serve as the
 
introductions to each series,  as they are later published.
 
--sound samples from each series,  perhaps one to three selections
 
from each series
 
--representative photography from each series
 
--at  least  one  or  two brief  film/video  clips  to  illustrate
 
performance of some of the music in question,  and/or Alan
 
speaking  (
either historic or contemporary)
 
--possible initial celebrity quotations,  as appropriate
 
- -
-all the usual contact information,  credits for people involved
 
in the project at least as of that date,  a bibliography of
 
Lomax family publications,  etc.
 
Naturally, we would also need to have a print version available for
 
those who were either not  facile with computers or would simply
 
prefer  to  have  the  release  in  print  form.
 Nonetheless,  ths
 
statement  we would make would be  impressive  and  lend a certain
 
cachet and a certain gravity to the launch of The Lomax Collection.
 
Please let us know your thoughts on this.
 It does seem that the
 
work to develop such a comprehensive press release would also be
 
time well spent in coming to an understanding of the fullness of
 
the  Collection  and  the  methods  we  would  best  employ  to  begin
 
ublicat ion.

PREVIOUSLY PUBLISHED RECORDINGS
 
1.  Southern Journey  -
 12  LPs,  previously released on  Prestige.
 
Prestige  released  in mono,  though original  tapes  are  in stereo.
 
Would have to be re-assembled from original masters.
 
2. Folk Songs of Great Britain (was released as 10 LPs on Caedmon.)
 
Alan says he has,  additionally,  "acres of other unpublished songs
 
from the British Isles.. .on the shelf."
 
3.  Heather  and Glen,  field recordings  made  in Scotland  1950-51.
 
Unclear how many volumes this is.
 
4.  Folk Songs  of  Spain  (
eleven LPs)
 There  is  also  "much"  extra
 
material here,  in case we wanted even more than 11 albums on Spain.
 
Another letter refers to 12 albums.
 
5.  The Columbia World Library of Folk and Primitive Music  (
14 or
 
16 masters,  depending on the letter,  were released and Alan says
 
he has edited material for a couple more,  one from Mexico and one
 
other which in one letter he says is from "the Middle East" and in
 
another he says is from "Persia"
 
6
.  Italian Folk Music  (
enough for a "dozen or more" CDs,  and a huge
 
library of unissued material.
 "Two published,  10 unpublished."
 
7.  Negro Prison Songs,  from Mississippi  1947.
 There are already
 
two overlapping releases out on budget CBs.
 I still would think
 
we would want to release a definitive one,  even if at the higher
 
price.
 Alan says there is enough for a full double album,  which
 
would probably be the way to go.
