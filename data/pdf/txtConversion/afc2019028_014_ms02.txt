Abstract: Mr. Glenn Morris owns the oldest and most successful African-American-owned
“beef” farms in Indiana, where he also raises a variety of crops on his farm in the African
American farming community of Lyles Station, Indiana (Lyles Station is featured in a major
exhibit at the Smithsonian’s NMAAHC). Members of the African-descended Morris family
arrived in the Wabash river valley around 1800 from Charleston, SC where they have been
propertied free people of color. In the 1790s they petitioned the state of SC to end the
recently-created racist poll tax levied against them, before many of them left for the Northwest
Territorial frontier. Members of the Morris family helped to build Fort Allison and fought in the
War of 1812 in the Northwest Territory. In 2019 Glenn Morris was the first African American
farmer in the history of Indiana to be awarded “Farmer of the Day” at the 2019 Indiana State
Fair. (

Part 2 of 2
[0:00] Continues discussion of dangers of driving
[5:00] Glenn discusses the farming community he grew up in, how his family mainly stayed in
the country during his childhood. Discusses how he didn’t know anyone from town until he went
to high school. Talks about experiencing racial discrimination in town in food service, theatres,
and restrooms.
[10:00] Discusses integrating a white school in 6th grade and the bullying and racial
discrimination faced from white children. Talks about how some teachers hosted minstrel shows
that all the students were required to watch.  Glenn made some lifelong friends with some white
children who were kind.
[15:00] Great-great-grandfather Stewart came with the Stormonts a white family who was known
for being more fair than most in race relations. [ALC: The Stormonts were URR operatives who
worked closely with the African American Grier family and were involved in one of the most
famous URR escape attempts of the 1850. For more information see the Stormont family entry in
Gibson County, Indiana on the National Park Service URR Network to Freedom program site.]
ALC discusses the lineages of other African-American Midwest farmers.
[20:00] His family put a levee on part of their land that was flooding, after that 150 acres were
able to consistently produce crops.  ALC asks what question she should have asked. Glenn
discusses how today a white man with no farming experience would still be given preference
over him in renting land.
[25:00] ALC talks about the value of the farming land to American history.  Glenn talks about
how farming is something you must learn over the years because the learning curve is so steep
and so much knowledge and skill is required. Glenn discusses what he’d want young people
from the city to know about farming and talks about the hope and big dreams needed to farm.
[30:00]  Experienced many tough times trying to make ends meet. Glenn talks about how he’s
going to be honored at the Indiana State Fair and how people will be surprised to see him.
