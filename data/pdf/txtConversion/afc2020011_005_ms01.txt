Library in Stillwater, Oklahoma. 
Project Detail 
This project is supported by the Archie Green Fellowship of the American Folklife Center at the 
Library of Congress. 
The purpose of the Immigrant Women Artists Oral History Project is to examine the occupational 
folklife of first-generation immigrant women artists living in Oklahoma and the networks of 
support that allow them to pursue their vocations in a 
new environment. This series of interviews 
examines not only the cultural and occupational traditions that these artists nurture in straddling 
multiple cultural identities, but also the translation of an artist's occupational life between 
multiple cultural and physical spaces. 
Legal Status

Occupational Folklife Oral History Project 
About Angelika Sowka... 
Multimedia artist Angelika Sowka was born and raised in a 
small town in Poland, and she was 
inspired artistically by her mother and her older sister. At fifteen, she moved to the city of Nowy 
Wisnicz to study art, and then she attended Pedagogical University of Krakow after high school. 
She always loved the use of light and shadow in photography, especially with the human figure 
and the abstract perspectives that could be captured, but she focused her university studies on 
painting, graphic design, and printmaking, with a 
specific passion for lithography. She earned 
her bachelor's and master's degrees, and then moved to Oklahoma with her husband. In 2020, 
ARTSPACE at Untitled in Oklahoma City accepted her for its Artist in Residence program, and 
the residency proved to be an eye-opening experience for Angelika. There, she learned new 
techniques of printmaking that influenced and developed her methods, and she began to use 
color in her prints, whereas prior to this, her color palette had been primarily black and white and 
monochromatic. 
After ARTSPACE, Angelika continued living and working in Oklahoma City. Through her 
printmaking, drawing, painting, and photography, she interprets her feelings and experiences, 
and she portrays abstract views of the human body and human relationships. In this interview, 
she described differences between art she studied and produced in Poland as opposed to the art 
she has observed in America. She shared some highs and lows of her art career, and she detailed 
her hopes and plans for the future.

Sowka 
All right, this is Julie Pearson-Little Thunder with the Oklahoma Oral 
History Research Program at Oklahoma State University. Today is March 
13, 2021, and this is a 
remote interview with Angelika Sowka for the Library 
c 
f 
Congress' OcciApational Folkl fe Prc 
ject funded by the Archie Green 
Fellowship. I'm in Tulsa, and, Angelika, you're in Oklahoma City where 
you're a 
multimedia artist working in painting, photography, and 
printmaking. I'm looking forward to learning more about you and your 
work. Where were you born, and where did you grow iAp? 
I 
was born in a 
small city in Poland, and I 
grew up actually there with my 
family. When I 
was fifteen, I 
moved to the other city to start my art [high] 
school. 
Little Thunder 
Was it in Krakow? Excuse me. 
Sowka 
It was in Nowy Wisnicz, the city close to the Krakow. After high school, I 
was studying in Krakow. 
Little Thunder 
So it sounds like you were interested in art early on, very early in your I 
fe. 
Sowka 
Yes, I 
was. 
Little Thunder 
Were you interested in art? 
Sowka 
I 
wasn't doing art before I 
started high school, so it was the first time when I 
started [making] art. I 
was interested in because my mom was amateur 
painter and my big sister was also attending to the art high school, and it was 
kind of like because of them. 
Little Thunder 
They were an inspiration.

Little Thunder 
Sowka 
Yes. 
Yes, I 
was going to ask what your mother and 
father did for a 
living. 
So my mom is a 
nurse. 
So what was your first art experience, maybe, in high school or earlier that 
made you think you might want to explore art? Was it seeing your mom's 
paintings, or what was your 
first sort c 
f 
attraction? 
So I 
think first thing was actually in high school when I 
met everything like 
different subjects, like different mediums. I 
think that photography was the 
most important to me in that time, and it developed me to studying the ... to 
study graphic design and printmaking, yeah. 
What did you like about photography? 
I 
like the play with the lights, like with the lights and shadow. I 
like to 
photograph human body, so it was, like, interesting to me. With the 
photography, you can express yourself and show the human body in a 
different way, like some kind of the abstract way. I 
very like abstract art. I 
love to use this also in photography. I 
don't like to photograph the portraits 
or something like this. I 
like the whole body and show it in the abstract way. 
Yes, I 
love your photographs. They're really interesting. 
Thank you. 
So when you got to college, what did you study exactly? 
I 
did like double degree, so I 
studied painting. It was like I 
studied for five 
years painting, and I 
had there different media, different subject, different 
courses like the photography, illustration, painting, drawing, and even more. 
In the same time, I 
was studying printmaking and graphic design. It was like 
together. I 
did like theI finished this one in a 
bachelor's degree, so it was 
like for three years. 
A 
very, very deep background in all those media, and you got your master's 
degree, also, there. 
Yes.

Sowka 
Little Thunder 
Sowka 
You specialized in printmaking. Why did you decide on that? 
Okay, so I 
like kind of, if I 
can say that, I 
fell in love in lithography. Like it 
was the first printmaking technique that I 
learned. It was something that I 
liked and I 
like still. This was the first printmaking technique. I 
also did my 
diploma there in ... lithography studio at the university. I 
feel like this project 
was the best one, if I 
can say that. (Laughs) I 
like it very much. 
Can you explain a 
little bit what lithography is for us, just the simplest.... 
Okay, so lithography is the printmaking technique that for the matrix you 
use the flat stone, and this technique is a 
flat technique, which means that 
you don't have on your matrix any differences between the high, like on the 
surrounding. You need to use the acid to change the environment on the 
stone to print from the stone. Yeah, I 
think this was the simplest way that I 
could explain this. 
Good 
job. How did you end iAp in Oklahoma? 
I 
moved here with my husband. He got internship here, and we moved 
together. He's biotechnologist and, yeah, that's why. 
What were your 
first impressions cf Oklahoma when you got here? 
So the first impression were people, actually, because everyone is really 
kind. Here is like the hospitality, and I 
feel very good here. I 
hear a 
lot of 
compliments on the streets like, "Oh, I 
like your glasses," "I 
like your 
shoes," or something like this. This was pretty different. Yeah, it is this. 
How about your 
first impressions cf the Oklahoma art scene? What were 
they? 
Okay, so I 
started from Paseo, and so this was the first place where I 
was 
seeing art here. 
I'm going to just add that Paseo is one cf the, like, shopping areas in 
Oklahoma City, arts district. 
I 
noticed that Oklahoma art is different because here, Oklahoma artists use a 
lot of colors. It was like... it was different, yeah. I 
noticed that, also, 
Oklahoma artists use the topics like connected to the United States, to the 
country, to the Oklahoma, to the city.... 
6 
[00:10:05] 
Little Thunder 
Sowka 
Little Thunder 
So really sort cf specific themes that were... local themes, sort cf. How did 
you get involved with the residency at [ARISPACE ai] Untitled? You have a 
residency there. 
I 
was looking for something for me to do here because in the beginning, I 
couldn't work or I 
couldn't even drive. I 
applied for every document I 
needed, and during that I 
was waiting, I 
started looking for something else. I 
found this on the internet, the opportunity to apply there, and I 
applied. Then 
I 
got this. It was pretty like, I 
applied and they chose me. I 
started there in 
January 2020. I 
learned there a 
lot. I 
learned how to do screen printing like I 
have never done this before, so this was like the first time. I 
did my whole 
project in this printmaking technique. 
What were the requirements for the residency? What are, kind cf, the rules 
that you have to.... Are you free to do whatever you want, or how does it 
work? 
Sowka 
I 
needed to do a 
set of prints... and I 
needed to share them with ARTSPACE. 
It was like forty prints, and twenty was for me and twenty for [them]. 
Little Thunder 
I 
see. 
Sowka 
[00:13:40] 
Yeah, and I 
did something different because I 
could do everything what I 
wanted. I 
have created prints from the same two matrices, but each print was 
in different colors. It was the set from the different colors printed from the 
same matrix. It was something unusual here because usually artists ... here 
should do the prints from the same color, like the same set of prints, [the 
same colors for each copy] . 
Little Thunder 
... Cool, yes, I've seen pictures cf that series. What do you like about 
working in a 
series? 
Sowka 
I 
like my ideas. I 
always have some idea in the beginning, and I 
do sketches. 
I 
like the series because like my idea develops. That's why I 
do series, 
because I 
have something, and then I 
want to do, like, more of this and 
continue this first idea. That's why. 
Little Thunder 
Continue exploring. Is that also true for your photography and your 
painting, or are they more independent units when you create them?

Sowka 
Little Thunder 
In photography, I 
also like to do series. This is also because I 
like to have 
my 
project done in the way that I 
could display it in the gallery as my own 
exhibit. 
With a 
certain number cfphotographs. 
Yeah. 
Well, I 
love your photographs, and, like you said... often it's an angle, a 
nude body shot at a 
certain angle that makes it look very abstract, posed in 
these unusual poses. A 
lot cf times, I 
noticed you sort cf 
focus on hands, 
people's hands, and I 
wonder what's interesting to you about hands. 
... This one was created for the exhibition, and it was the theme gestures. 
I'm not sure if this is the word, like what you can do with your hand. 
Gestures, yes. 
Gestures, oh, thank you so much. 
Yes, you're right. Yeah, oh! 
Yeah, it was something that inspired me, like what kind of gesture you can 
do and what this expressed. 
In one cf your artist statements, you talk about emotion being the source cf 
a 
lot cf your imagery. What are some ways that you try to make sure the 
viewer feels a 
strong emotion when they're looking at your work? 
In my art, I 
want to like maybe (I 
don't know if this is the word) make 
people to see what I 
am like inside me. I 
want them to feel what I 
feel. 
Those emotions in my art are inspired by my past and my future, also, like 
what I 
think about something or something like this, and about the present. 
This is always something from my 
life. Yeah, I 
think about the topic, and I 
think about how this is connected with me. 
Cool. You've also done illustrations. I 
really like your illustrations. They 
feel completely d,,ferent. They're more whimsical, more light, you know, 
and 
feeling. I 
wondered what prc 
jects you have done illustrations for. 
What do you mean? What kind of illustration? 
Well, they're on your website, yes. 
8 
Sowka 
Okay, because I 
have, like, few there. I 
have illustrations for the book I 
did, 
and I 
have also the illustrations like the person inside the room or something 
like this. I'm not sure what you are talking about. 
Little Thunder 
So you did a 
book. 
Sowka 
[00:19:30] 
Little Thunder 
Sowka 
It was the university project, so it wasn't published or anything. It was a 
book about Buddhism. I 
illustrated those illustrations, and I 
created all book 
like I 
set up this in InDesign application. 
They're great. I 
think you should do more. So when the pandemic started in 
2020, you shared with me that a 
few months into the shutdown, you took 
advantage cf that to really work on your English. How did you go about 
that? 
Okay, so I 
can say that my English was very bad in the beginning when I 
moved here. I 
had English at school, but it was different here, the different 
accent and people also talk pretty fast. I 
was like, "Okay, I 
cannot 
understand anything." I 
started studying, and my husband helped me 
because his English is very good. He helped me with grammar, and actually 
he helped me study. We were, like, reading together. I 
was reading out loud. 
He was correcting me, and actually this was the best way to improve my 
English, to read out loud. After the pandemic—yeah, we have still 
pandemic. After the first lockdown we had here in Oklahoma City, I 
was 
back in ARTSPACE or in my work, and I 
was more comfortable to speak to 
people. It helped me a 
lot. 
Little Thunder 
You took great advantage c 
f 
that time. What's been the reception for your 
work so far? How have people taken to your work so far? 
Sowka 
Like what do you mean? 
Little Thunder 
Maybe some compliments that you've gotten on your work or some 
reactions that you've gotten to your work. 
Sowka 
I 
heard that my art from the website and mostly the lithography, that this is 
pretty dark art and what I 
have inside that I 
did something like this. Besides 
this, I 
heard pretty good comments about my art. People like it. Mostly this 
colorful project from ARTSPACE from my residency, I 
had exhibition here 
at the ARTSPACE, and a 
lot of people was there to see this. I 
heard that this 
was good one. So, yeah, mostly like the positive comments. 
Little Thunder 
I 
like your black-and-whites, personally. I 
think they're very dramatic and 
very emotional.

Sowka 
Thank you. 
What ties, or are there any ties that you have with the.... There's a 
Polish 
American community, cf course, in Oklahoma, like everywhere else. I 
don't 
know f you've met people from that community. What ties do you have? 
I 
have met some Polish people here in Oklahoma City, and they are mostly 
people from the internship that my husband is on, like scientists mostly. We 
hang out sometimes. Maybe not now because of the pandemic, but before 
the pandemic, we were meeting.... Oh, I 
forgot the word. 
Pretty regularly. 
Yeah, yes, this is the word. Thank you. (Laughter) 
How much have you networked with other immigrant women artists? 
I 
think I 
don't have any. I 
know artists from ARTSPACE, from my work in 
Oklahoma Contemporary Arts Center. There is a 
few artists, but I 
don't 
know any immigrants artists here. 
Immigrant artists here. How important are galleries to you right now in 
marketing your work? How important are they? 
Like the ... I 
don't know.... 
Galleries. Are you using art galleries very much, or are you mostly working 
at ARTSPACE? 
Yeah, so I 
mostly work in ARTSPACE. I'm a 
member now there, so I 
can 
use a 
studio anytime I 
need. I 
mostly work there. 
Is it a 
cooperative, Angelika? Is it a 
co-6p where people take turns running 
it? Do the artists take turns working atARLSPACE to keep it running, or is 
it.... 
I 
don't actually understand. What do you mean? 
That's all right. I 
imagine it's either the artists who run the space or it has a 
manager. It has a 
gallery owner. 
Oh, yeah, yeah, so there [are] artists that lead the classes there because there 
are classes for students, or open art studios. Some artists also lead classes, 
10 
like the member artists. For example, I 
could lead the class there, but I 
don't 
know. I 
don't feel like I 
want to. 
Little Thunder 
Go there yet. 
Sowka 
Yeah. For now, I 
just want to use the space to create my own art. 
Little Thunder 
And you had at least one opening during the pandemic, right? I 
saw you 
kind cf in front cf your work with a 
mask. I 
don't know.... 
Sowka 
Oh, yeah, so it was in December, and this is the project that I 
have created 
for Artist in Residence. This is the project, and I 
had the exhibit there. 
[00:27:10] 
Little Thunder 
With the color series. You're also an artist in residence at [Cristo Rey 
Catholic High Schoo•] in Oklahoma City. When did you start that? 
Sowka 
Yeah, so I 
also start in January 2020. I 
was teaching photography there for a 
few months, and it was after class classes. Now I'm back there because I 
had 
a 
break there and now I'm back there. I 
teach media art in high school. 
Little Thunder 
But you're teaching virtually, correct? 
Sowka 
Yes, I 
was teaching virtually, and now we have, like, hybrid. 
Little Thunder 
Okay. 
Sowka 
We have a 
few hours in school and a 
few online. 
Little Thunder 
What were the challenges cf teaching photography virtually? What were the 
challenges? What was hard about it? 
Sowka 
Little Thunder 
Sowka 
It was mostly to keep students attending to this course. Actually, also the 
teaching via Zoom, it was hard because we couldn't, like, use the studio. We 
couldn't take a 
photo together in a 
class. Yeah, it was hard. I 
was mostly 
saying about theory, right? They needed to practice by themselves. 
Right, you were talking about theory and, yeah, letting them practice. 
What's been the hardest art project you've done since you got to Oklahoma, 
the hardest one? 
I 
don't know. I 
think if I 
have to compare it to my being in Poland, and so 
there I 
did the hardest project that, I 
think, ever. Yeah, nothing was that hard 
here, for now. (Laughter)

And what one was that, again? Was that the.... 
It was my lithography. 
Lithography. 
Yeah, it was hard because I 
was printed on the large fabric and it was, like, 
ten meters. It was very large, and it was very hard to keep it clean on the 
press and everything. 
You have your hard stt f 
behind you. Well, what's been a 
highlight c 
f 
your 
artwork here in Oklahoma so far? What's been a 
high point? 
So I 
think the time that I 
was in the Artist in Residency program, it was the 
very good time. I 
think it was the one step to me to open to art here and to 
the people, so this one. 
And how about, like, a 
really low point, a 
d,. ficult time here? 
So the low point, I 
think time to time I 
have the low points for some time 
because, like, I 
don't have any ideas or I'm sad or something like this, so I 
don't want to create anything. I 
think this is because I 
miss my family and 
friends. Sometimes I 
feel pretty bad, and I 
don't want to do anything, yeah, 
but nothing specific I 
can say. 
How cften do you communicate with your family and 
friends? 
Every day. (Laughs) I 
talk with my sisters. We have the online chat together. 
We, like, text every day. 
That's great. I 
understand you and your husband are moving to Montreal in 
July. How did that come about, and what are you looking forward to? 
Okay, so we are moving to Montreal in September, but in July we're 
moving from here. We're going to Poland for a 
summer, and in September 
we're moving to Montreal. 
Okay. 
I 
would like to develop my career as an artist there. Also, I 
would like to 
develop my graphic design skills and work in the graphic design industry. 
Like, I 
would like to design websites. 
Little Thunder 
Okay, yeah, well, it's a 
wonderful city. I 
know you'll er joy it there. 
12 
Sowka 
Yeah, I 
really like that we are going to move to Montreal because this is like 
more European city, so this is pretty good. 
[00:33:52] 
Little Thunder 
Yes, you hear a 
lot cf languages iAp there, and it's wonderful, all the 
d,.) ferent peoples that live iAp there. Is there anything we forgot to talk about 
or anything you'd like to add about your art journey so far? 
Sowka 
Sure. I 
think I 
said mostly everything. I 
look forward to move to Montreal. I 
will have good memories from Oklahoma City. I'm very glad that we end up 
here because it was good experience and it still is. 
Little Thunder 
Well, I'm glad. I'm glad to hear that. Thank you for your time today, 
Angelika, and I 
look forward to keeping track c 
f 
your future creations. 
Sowka 
Thank you so much. Thank you for inviting me for this interview.
