Ben RiceJack StaffordMy name it is Jack Stafford, I came from Springfield Town;I've traveled this wide
world over, boys, I've traveled all around .I've had my ups and downs in live, and better days I've
saw,But I never knew what misery was till I struck Arkansas.It was in the year of eighty-two, in the
merry month of June,I landed in Hot Springs[ ,?] one sultry afternoon.There came a walking skeleton
and handed me his paw[,?]Invited me to his hotel, the best in Arkansas.I followed my conductor up
to his dwelling place, [Whosed?] Whose poverty was depicted in his [melancholy?] face.His bread it
was corn dodger, his beef I could not chaw.Oh, that's the kind of chuck I got in the state of Arkansas.I
started out next morning to catch an early train.Said he, "You'd better work for me; I have some
land to drain,I'll give you fifty cents a day, your washing, board and all,You'll find yourself a different
man when you leave Arkansas."I worked six weeks for the son-of-a-gun, [[Jess?] Herald Harold ?]
was his name.He stood six feet within his boots, an slim as any crane;His hair hung down in rat
tails, down o'er his lanky jaw.?a chance [ He was a [photograph?] of all the gents that's raised / in
Arkansas.He fed me on corn dodger as hard as any rock,My teeth begin to loosen, my knees begin
to knock,I got so thin on sassafrass tea, I could hide behind a straw;Indeed, I was a different man
when I left Arkansas.Farewell to them soft angels that cambricks and that chills ? Farewell to sage
and sassafrass tea and them corn dodger pills.If ever I see that land again, I'll give you all my paw,It
will be through the telescope from hell to Arkansas.
