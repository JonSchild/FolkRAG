importance of ﬁnding the right “ﬁt” between bakers; “... just throw ‘em in; they might get

process of creating a donut; so it’s important that everyone is on the same page and able to 
work together. Discussion of navigating disagreements between back-of-house staﬀ and 
making sure the work gets done while also actually abiding people’s social needs
●
“They have a unique skill that we don’t have anymore … so you can’t just come in and drop 
the hammer on them; you have to be respectful, because they do make our donuts, that we 
sell to people; and they do keep the Buckeye Donuts name going.”

Czar” (01:06:00) and ﬁgures out exactly what needs to be made each day; discussion of how

Pete discusses how diﬃcult it can be to ﬁnd professional bakers in Columbus, especially for a 
place like Buckeye Donuts, that does hand-cut donuts, made-fresh each day on-location (as 
compared to store locations like Krispy Kreme and Tim Horton’s); no timer for prooﬁng, 
frying, etc.; these are all highly skilled processes
●
Bakers are paid hourly, but more than other employees; Pete thinks it’s something like 
$15-20/hour; and some bakers take on multiple roles within the company (doubling as 
catering drivers, etc.) or work at multiple bakeries; oﬀering perks to “loyal” employees, such 
as oﬀering their catering driver personal use of the catering vehicle; wife of a baker coming

more sensitive to the employees.”
●
01:23:00 -- Retaining bakers and employees
●
01:24:00 -- Burdens and learning curve of retraining if bakers left for other bakeries;

Buckeye Donuts
