BE SURE YOU ARE RIGHT
Some will tell you “'Tis all right.” While others say “'Tis wrong.” Now listen to what I have to
say; My motto is my song.
Be sure you're right, then go ahead; Don't mind what people say. You have a row that you
must hoe, So hoe it your best way.
Sung by Mrs. Grace Lungino, Huntsville, Texas, May, 1939.
