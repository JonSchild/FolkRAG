There is due to the deceased from the ATLANTIC

death of his father and a subsequent assignment by DOROTHEA
 
CABLE CARY, of South Bolton Road, Bolton, Massachusetts.
 I
 
request that said future royalties be paid to me as they
 
become due and payable, without procuring Letters of
 
Administration in accordance with Probate Code Section 630.
 
The deceased left surviving him the following heirs at
 
law:
