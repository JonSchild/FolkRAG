Congress, at Washington, D. C. 
Empty Is The Stable, Davy's Gone. 
Written by BEN COLLINS. COPYRIGHTED, 1881, by A. J. 
FISHER 
Sung with great success by LESTER & W ILLIAMS. 
I 
used to own a 
donkey, a 
bob-tail stubborn mule, 
He was born about the year of '49; 
His head was full of scars from stopping Railroad cars, 
He was ring-boned, spavined, deaf and blind; 
He could kick a 
steam engine, and raise you through 
the roof, 
And send you where Bob Ingersoll belongs; 
He died at half past four, he's gone to that beautiful 
shore, 
Empty is the stable, Davy's gone. 
CHORUS: 
Gone to join the angels with spit-curls on his hair, 
Died with epizootic in the head; 
He might have gone to Congress if he only lived, 
Empty is the stable, Davy's gone. 
His hoof was like a 
slungshot, he could raise you 
through the roof, 
He'd come into the house and kick you out of bed; 
His feet was full of bunions, he could eat a 
barrel of 
onions, 
And go to sleep a 
standing on his head; 
He'd go to a 
saloon, shove his hoof through a 
spittoon 
And kick the bar into the gutter for a 
joke, 
When he laid down and di NI, every mule in Jersey died 
Empty is the stable, Davy's gone. 
CHORUS: 
Davy's left the stable for the promised land, 
His overshoes and saddle are in pawn; 
No more hay he'll ever chew , 
th ey 
ye turned him into 
glue, 
Empty is the stable Davy's gone, 
As sung by LESTER SL 
W ILLIA1.CS. 
Now I'm going to sing a 
little song, the tune you've heard 
before, 
'Tain't Grimes' cellar door, or love in days of yore; 
You've young fellows slipped upon a 
lean banana core, 
But here is something new; 
I'm in love with Cranky Ann, and 1 
asked her for her hand, 
And she gave it to me right across the ear. 
If there's any young girl here would like to treat me to 
some beer, 
I 
will meet her in the bar-room by and by. 
CHORUS: 
You may kiss and caress me and I'll never say no, 
I 
couldn't say no, I 
wouldn't say no; 
Buy me a 
Tom and Jerry, a 
keg of beer or so, 
But don't you tell my sister. 
As you can plainly see, with them we tra la la lee, 
They throw gumdrops at me, and follow me all over the 
town 
Like a 
gang of hungry bees, 
And buy me lemonade and taffy all the day; 
There's one in the gallery, you rascal I 
can see, 
You come here because you couldn't stay away. 
If to kiss me you would try, I 
know that I 
should die, 
And quietly pull down the blind and say: 
CIIORUS : 
You may kiss me and caress me and I'll never say nix, 
Oh, come and kiss me quick, I'll strike you with a 
brick; 
You may chew my alabaster ear, I'll never make a 
kick, 
But don't you tell my sister, 
BUGGY RIDING. 
Recitation by LESTER ct W ILLIAMS. 
Copyrighted by A. J. FISHER, 1881. 
"Suppose," said he in accents soft, 
" 
A 
felloe just like me, 
Should axle little girl to wed, 
What would the answer be?" 
The maiden drops her roguish eyes, 
Her smiles with blushes mingle; 
"Why seek the 'Bridle ( II) alter' 
When, dear sir, you can live single?" 
And then he spoke: " Oh, be my bride, 
I 
ask you once again; 
You are the empress of my soul, 
And there shall ever rein. 
" 
I'll never tire of kindly. deeds 
To win your gentle heart, 
And saddle be the shaft that rends 
Our happy lives apart." 
Upon her cheeks the maiden felt 
The mantling blushes glow. 
She took him for her faithful hub, 
To share his wheel or whoa. 
TORPEDO AND THE WHALE. 
In our back yard there lives two bums, 
They can dance upon their gums; 
They never had no thumbs, 
And with Ben Butler they were chums. 
CHORUS: 
Oh, they are crazy and lazy, 
Garfield and Ilazey; 
They are gentlemen of rank, 
Cage them up in some big tank, 
And we'll let them rob some bank, 
Then bite off their nose. 
In our back alley lives a 
cat, 
And her maiden name is Pat; 
She could sleep in an old bat, 
And in a 
butcher's she eats fat. 
In our back alley lives a 
guy, 
And he never told a 
lie; 
He h 
not afraid to die, 
And he makes his living stealing pie. 
Chorus. 
(Chorus), 
They ain't pleasing, they are teasing, 
Like lemons they need squeezing, 
lie's got warts upon his nose, 
lie never wore no clothes, 
He never sleeps, he'd always doze, 
And wash himself in soup.

WHIST! WHIST! 
-: 0:-
As sung by LESTER & W ILLIAMS, 
Such a 
lot of dizzy fairies every day you'll meet, 
Forty-five cent switches on their heads, no stocking 
on their feet; 
Living on free lunches and clam chowder, 
Their cheeks and faces disfigured with common paint 
and powder. 
Clioncs; 
You're a 
brick, whist, whist, 
You make me sick, whist, whist, 
Oh, pull up your skirts and run around the 
park; 
Give him a 
brace, whist, whist, 
Poison face, whist, whist, 
Is what those dizzy maidens all remark 
While seated with a 
fairy and enjoying the breeze, 
Of the kidney stew and liver and limburger cheese, 
When in a 
bruiser came and said, young fellow, this 
looks queer, 
If you don't let my girl alone, I'll bite your ear. 
CHORUS: 
Up I 
got, whist, whist, 
Away I 
shot, whist, whist, 
And they sat down at the table with a 
whist, 
whist, whist; 
So if you're flip, whist, whist, 
Always skip, whist, whist, 
When a 
bruiser comes to claim his girl, get 
up and get. 
As sung with great success by Tont PASTOR all through the 
United States. 
The topics of the day I 
sing, 
And hope I 
won't offend; 
I 
shoot at Folly on the wing, 
Though all mankind' my friend; 
The darling girls, the pretty dears, 
In ulsters cut a 
swell; 
How long before their chins will sprout, 
That's more than I 
can tell. 
CHORUS: 
That's more than I 
can tell, 
That's more than I 
can tell, 
How long before they'll pant for pants, 
That's more than I 
can tell. 
I 
know a 
widow, nice and sweet, 
And so bewitching, too; 
I 
breathed my passion at hut. feet, 
And swore my love was true; 
But widows they are dreadful sly, 
And oft turn out a 
sell; 
Who kissed those lips when I 
vamoosed? 
That's more than I 
can tell! 
CHORUS: 
That's more than I 
can tell, 
That's more than I 
can tell; 
What fellows wear the rings I 
gave— 
That's more than I 
can tell. 
My neighbor has a 
pretty wife, 
The parson visits there; 
I 
can't see why, upon my life. 
Each day, through foul or fair; 
If duty calls him to her side, 
Her griefs or cares to quell; 
Or comfort to her soul he brings, 
That's more than I 
can tell. 
THAT'S MORE THAN I 
CAN TELL— CONTINUED. 
CHORUS: 
That's more than I 
can tell, 
That's more than I 
can tell, 
But why her spouse don't smell a 
mice, 
That's more than I 
can tell. 
Bob Ingersoll goes spouting round, 
And people flock to hear; 
That many think he's very sound 
Upon the goose ' tis clear; 
Now if he takes the skyward road 
And doesn't go to—well, 
Will Talmage shake his hand up there? 
That's more than I 
can tell. 
CHORUS: 
That's more than I 
can tell, 
That's more than I 
can tell, 
Will each of them have wings to flop? 
That's more than I 
can tell. 
The preachers now are up in arms, 
To shut the playhouse doors; 
They preach about the awful harms, 
That wicked actors cause; 
Though black sheep dwell in every flock, 
how many parsons swell 
The ranks of scandal every year? 
That's more than I 
can tell. 
CHORUS,: 
That's more than I 
can tell, 
That's mare than I 
can tell, 
Why don't they let the actors rest? 
That's more than I 
can tell. 
NEVER AGAIN, 
How often we hear old fogies declare, 
If they could live over again; 
They'd never get wed or caught in a 
snare, 
But play quite a 
different game; 
It's all very well for people to talk, 
Of things in this world they would do; 
But start them again, you'd find they would walk 
The same path of life they've gone through. 
SPOKEN.—Look at the married man after his day's toil. 
He rushes home to his family and his evening meal, which 
is accompanied by the baby screaming the roof off. 
lie 
says, " What an idiot a 
man must be to marry!" The 
wife says, " If I 
were to die to-morrow, you'd get married 
in a 
month," to which he replies: 
Cuonus: 
Never again, love, never again, 
Smiles are bewitching and women are vain; 
Husbands are soft that never complain, 
You've had me this time, love, but never again. 
How awful bewitching the old woman is, 
Whenever she wants a 
new dress; 
She'll ask her sweet babe to kiss his papa, 
And puts on a 
smile of the best; 
NEVER AGAIN— CoNTINutp. 
The husband, poor lamb, is dragged to a 
shop, 
To see how much money she'll waste; 
And when he is there, of course he must shop, 
Because he has got such a 
taste. 
SPOKEN.—Poor devil! the wife orders twenty yards of 
silk at three dollars a 
yard. 
The old boy goes home sing-
ing— 
Never again, love, etc. 
Sweet honeymoons and connubial bliss, 
Are all very nice, I 
dare say; 
But some married couples are always amiss, 
They're fighting and rowing all day; 
The wife says, " I'm sure I'll go home to ma, 
And thus from a 
brute I'll remain; 
But when she starts out, she finds it's too far, 
And turns to her dear home again. 
SPOKEN.—And laying her head artfully on his shoulder, 
says, " James, dear, you won't tell me to boil my face in 
the fish-kettle 
again, will you, darling?" 
He, in an 
instant, says--

Oh! It's Awfully Wrong To Be Poor. 
As sung by America's own Vocalist, TONY PASTOR, with great 
success. 
His latest hit. 
I 
am a 
dreadful character, in vice I 
go the pace, 
I'll give a 
start to any man, and win an easy race; 
I've galloped helter-skelter through the catalogue of 
crimes, 
Committed theft and perjury at least a 
dozen times; 
I've had my fling at forgery, at felony and fraud, 
And when I 
go marauding, you can bet I 
do maraud ; 
But I 
never condescended, though of crime I've made 
a 
tour, 
To the greatest crime in Christendom—the crime of 
being poor. 
CHORUS: 
And that's how I 
keep from detection, 
If you give it a 
moment's reflection 
You all will agree 
In this precept with me, 
That it's awfully wrong to be poor; 
For the rich oft may sin, 
While the poor get run in, 
Oh! it's awfull wrong to be poor. 
I've been a 
bank director, and the bank it went to 
-smash, 
For we played at speculation with a 
lot of poor folk's 
cash; 
I've got up little swindles in the shape of silver mines, 
And sold the juice of cabbage stalks as port and sherry 
wines; 
.44116 
13 
OH! IT'S AWFULLY WRONG TO BE POOR. 
(CONTINUED). 
I've manufactured butter out of railway grease and 
fat, 
But I 
go to church on Sundays, and I 
always smell 
my hat; 
My balance at my bankers makes my dodges safe and 
sure. 
The safest sort of roguery is to rob and cheat the poor. 
CHORUS: 
And that's how I 
keep from detection, 
If you give it a 
moment's reflection 
You all will agree 
In this precept with me, 
That it's safest to swindle the poor; 
For the rich make a 
row, 
But the poor folks we cow, 
So it's safest to swindle the poor. 
If my little game were murder, still I'd keep my maw-
leys clean, 
I. could bribe my poorer brothers—monarchs do the 
same, I 
ween; 
When their neighbor's land kings covet, what's about 
the price they pay? 
Don't they send men out to rob him at a 
bob a 
head a 
day? 
Bother guilt upon your conscience, if you've gold 
inside your purse, 
You can be as bad as I 
am, and, in fact, a 
little worse; 
Wealth can make the wicked honored, and give beauty 
to the boor, 
But you mustn't be a 
villain if you happen to be poor. 
And that's how I 
keep, etc. 
ALL ON ACCOUNT OF ELIZA.

Price, 
cents. 
As sung in the Opera of •` Billee Taylor" by 
TONY PASTOR AND COMPANY. 
The yarn as I'm about to spin, 
Is all on account of Eliza; 
I'll tell you how I 
was taken in, 
All on account of Eliza; 
She said that she'd ever be true to one, 
But she bolted away with a 
son of a 
gun! 
So I 
cut my stick and to sea I 
run, 
That it's all on account of Eliza. 
CHORUS: 
All on account, all on account, 
All on account of Eliza; 
He cut his stick and to sea he run, 
All on account of Eliza. 
I've nearly been blown away in a 
gale, 
All on account of Eliza; 
And I've almost been eaten up by a 
whale, 
AB on account of Eliza; 
I've had sword cuts by dozens, and I've been sho. 
through, 
I've had yellow fever and also the blue; 
I've been bitten by sharks, and by crocodiles, too, 
All on account of Eliza. 
CHORUS: 
All on account, all on account, 
All on account of Eliza; 
He's been bitten by sharks, and by crocodiles, too 
All on account of Eliza. 
ALL ON ACCOUNT OF ELIZA—CONTINUED. 
My duty is now, smart lads, to press, 
All on account of Eliza; 
If they say " No!" why I 
say " Yes!" 
All on account of Eliza; 
So look up, my messmates, some boys for the sea, 
And if to your summons they do not agree, 
Why, shiver my timbers, just tell 'em from me, 
That it's alron account of Eliza. 
CHORUS: 
All on account, all on account, 
All on account of Eliza; 
Why, shiver my timbers, just tell 'em says he 
That it's all on account of Eliza. 
I've courted the ladies all through my life, 
All on account of Eliza; 
But never could steer to the proper wife, 
All on account of Eliza; 
I've kissed and I've hugged them in ev'ry port, 
The fat and the lean, the tall and the short; 
But somehow or other, they weren't my sort, 
All on account of Eliza. 
CHORUS: 
All on account, all on account, 
All on account of Eliza; 
But somehow or other, they weren't my sort, 
All on account of Eliza. 
MARY ANN, I'LL TELL YOUR MA. 
Written and Composed by GEOFFREY THORN. Sung with great success 
by TONY PASTOR, America's own vocalist, 
this 
song is published by permission of E. H. HARDING, 
229 Bowery, New York. 
Price 10 cents. 
I 
spoon a 
girl named Mary Ann, a 
tender little dove, 
Who costs me lots of half- pence, and a 
precious deal of love; 
She's living with her mother, as a 
maiden ought to do, 
And looks as straight and proper as a 
sdint, or me or you. 
But somehow when I 
trot her round, no matter where we 
I'm struck with all the people that this maiden seems to 
know; 
For certain as Mary Ann I 
proudly take about, 
Some heads pop round the corner and a 
vulgar voice will 
shout— 
CHORUS: 
Oh, very well, Mary Ann, rn tell your Ma. 
She little thought when you came out you'd go so far; 
I'm sure your mother doesn't know the girl you are, 
Mary Ann, fie! for shame, 'VA! yah! yah! Oh! yah! 
We went last Whitsun Monday to the forest by the rail, 
We did the thing first class of course, at that I 
never fail, 
tipp'd the guard a 
shilling, or what you might call a 
bob, 
To lock us in a 
carriage and preserve us from the mob. 
We sat on downy cushions and the curtains drew for fun, 
For Polly said her pretty eyes they could not bear the sun; 
But when we settled snugly and were just about to go, 
A head came through the window and a 
fellow shouted— 
(Chorus). 
MARY ANN, I'LL TELL YOUR MA.—CoivriNtED. 
We wander'd through the forest glades as happy as could be, 
We thought from vulgar people there, we should at least 
be free; 
We sought a 
sweet secluded spot, where none our vows 
could hear, 
And whisper'd those soft, silly things, that lovers think so 
dear. 
We sat beneath a 
spreading oak, our loving arms entwined, 
While I 
was fond and foolish, she was gentle, sweet and 
kind; 
But just as I 
my passion told, and sealed it with a 
kiss, 
A 
chap birds-nesting up above, so rudely shouted this— 
(Chorus). 
We came away disgusted, and we quickly made for home, 
For everywhere we met the cry, no matter where we'd 
roam; 
My Mary Ann declared to me she knew those people not, 
In fact, she said she would not mix with such a 
vulgar lot. 
But on this precious mystery I 
have some little doubt, 
And almost think that Mary Ann must:know her way about; 
For when we parted at her door, or rather just inside, 
A voice came down the staircase, and her little brother 
cried— 
SOKEN.—Oh! oh! oh! 
(Chorus).

SHE'S UP AT MACY'S. 
— 
0 : 
As sung by America's own Vocalist, Tarry PASTOR. 
: 
0 : - 
Her name is Flora, and I 
adore her, 
If you could see her so would you; 
She's up at Macy's—you all know Macy's— 
Fourteenth Street, Sixth Avenue. 
She handles lace with such a 
grace, 
' 
he has a 
face like angel fair; 
She is so charming, 'tis quite alarming, 
The way the fellows at her stare. 
CHORUS: 
I 
am her cavalier, I 
am her pretty dear, 
She loves me fondly with a 
heart so true; 
I 
take her to the car, I'm solid with her ma, 
She's up at Macy's Fourteenth Street, Sixth Avenue. 
She's so congenial, there's nothing menial, 
She finds a 
kindred spirit here; 
I 
find the yardstick a 
very hard stick— 
Instead of wine I 
must drink beer. 
I'm on Broadway for little pay, 
And on the ladies wait all day; 
With joy I'm greeted, when I 
am seated, 
My heart to Flora flies away. 
(Chorus). 
19 
SHE'S UP AT MACY'S-CONTINUED. 
In fancy dances. with sister France; 
She glides as gneeful as a 
fawn; 
They all admire her her, they all desire her, 
But she is mine from dusk till dawn. 
She lives on pie, she makes me sigh, 
Whenever we go out to dine; 
But I 
adore her, my pretty Flora, 
To me she seems a 
girl divine. 
SPOICEN.—Yes, my sweetheart is up at 
Macy's Four-
teenth Street, Sixth Avenue. 
I'm in the same business 
myself, but not at Macy's; they're all girls up there—they 
wouldn't have such a 
thing as a 
man around. 
Flora is 
such a 
sweet girl. 
She used to go round a 
great deal, but 
now we are more settled down; there was a 
time I 
used to 
think nothing of going out and spending two dollars all by 
myself in one night, just for beer. 
We used to go to Coney 
Island very often. 
I 
remember one day Flora got so sick 
•on the boat I 
didn't know what to do. " Oh," she cried, 
" 
I 
want a 
scuze of a 
lemon, just one scuze." 
But lemons 
were ten cents apiece. 
She recovered, however, and the 
next day you could hear her sweet voice up at Macy's call 
ing, " Cash here! 
Cash here! 
Cash! 
Cash!" 
CHORUS: 
She wears a 
circular, all made of silk and fur, 
And on her hat a 
bunch of violets blue; 
She smokes a 
cigarette, she sings me " Olivette," 
She's up at Macy's, Fourteenth Street, Sixth Avenue.

OH, THOSE COWHIDE SLIPPERS! 
Written and sung by TONY PASTOR, Esq. 
Ain—Golden Slippers. 
A 
tale of love I 
now will tell, 
Of a 
charming maid I 
loved so well, 
Her name was Blue. eyed, Laughing Nell, 
A most bewitching girl. 
'Tams at a 
ball we chanced to meet, 
I 
never met a 
girl so sweet, 
She seemed a 
fairy, dressed so neat, 
My brain was in a 
whirl. 
SPOKEN.—Yes, '
twas at a 
ball I 
first met her, and, as she 
gracefully waltzed round the room, I 
felt I 
had lost my 
heart, and as she came sailing past me, I 
discovered that 
she had on her little footsey wootseys— 
CHORUS: 
Oh, such lovely slippers, 
Like to water dippers, 
Red rosettes, high French heels, 
And fancy little bows. 
Oh! those darling slippers, 
Oh, those daisy trippers, 
Trimmed with gold, double-soled, 
And pointed at the toes. 
We met again one rainy day, 
The walks all wet and muddy lay, 
With cautious feet she picked her way, 
And crossed the crowded street. 
I 
watched her proud and lofty stride, 
With two policemen at her side, 
Who helped her reach the other side, 
Policemen on the beat. 
SPOKEN — Old and young women. (Gag about police-
- men). (Chorus). 
Again we met as lovers may, 
I 
begged her name the wedding day, 
She blushed and fainted quite away, 
Just then I 
heard a 
roar— 
Her angry father raised his foot, 
He wore a 
number eleven boot, 
And through the air he let it scoot, 
And bounced me from his door. 
CHORUS: 
Oh! those cowhide slippers, 
Oh! those tan-yard nippers, 
Crashing! smashing! through the air, 
Tearing all my clothes— 
No more golden slippers, 
No more cowhide flippers, 
Copper-lined, iron bound, 
And loaded to the toes. 
JOLLY GOOD LUCK TO ALL.

HARDINGS, `,.. 29 Bowery. 
If I 
had the power a 
gift to bestow, 
On the friends that around me I 
see, 
I'd give them the very best gift that I 
know, 
The gift that they lucky should be; 
For no matter how clever, how foolish, how wise, 
No matter how great, or how small; 
By luck more than merit, we fall or we rise, 
So, here's jolly good luck to us all. 
CHORUS: 
Here's jolly good luck to us all, my friends, 
The best of good luck to us all; 
For by luck more than merit, we rise or we fall, 
So, here's jolly good luck to us all. 
One man may be gifted with talents divine, 
But may still in obscurity live; 
While shallower mortals successfully shine, 
And take all the world has to give; 
One waits on in vain, for good fortune's caress, 
While the other some chance may befall; 
Which used to advantage results in success, 
So, here's jolly good luck to us all. (Chorus). 
So, up and be doing, deserving good luck, 
And good fortune may favor the brave; 
For some of life's prizes are won by sheer pluck, 
And are lost by the indolent slave; 
There is always one chance in the life of a 
man, 
Which, if lost, he can never recall; 
So work for it, watch for it, hope if you can, 
That there's jolly good luck for us all. (Chorus).

- THE HEART-FELT WISH OF MINE.

topical 
song, with immense success every place he appeared.

0 :-----
The year of 1880 has gone now to decay, 
Another year from our lives has quickly passed away; 
But during its career many changes we have seen, 
And to many a 
poor man how eventful it has been; 
The truth of what I 
state, will appear now in my rhymes, 
For in them I 
mean to introduce some topics of the times; 
Plain talk alone I 
now will use, so listen to each line, 
And I'll name some things you all would like, 'tis the heart-
felt wish of mine. 
I 
really hope that it will never be my lot again, 
While strolling by the North River to see so many men 
With their faces pinched with hunger and shivering in the 
cold, 
Such a 
piteous sight has to me quite a 
tale of misery told; 
The long-shore-men attend the stands, yes, morning, noon 
and night, 
In hopes for wives and families that they might earn a 
bite; 
But luck seems all against them, for bread their children 
pine, 
trust they may see better days, 'tis the heart- felt wish of 
mine. 
A 
glorious brightness has across the Emerald Isle been cast 
Fortune long in coming, seems to smile on her at last; 
English persecution now, I 
think is nearly done. 
Their long, long race of tyranny I 
think is liearly run; 
Too long has Erin slumbered ' neath Saxon's cruel spell, 
Thank God, she's now awakened at the call of brave Parnell 
Rise, rise, ye true born Irishmen, with a 
firm and resolute 
mind, 
To have our brethren set free, 'tis the heart- felt wish of mine 
Sung with great success by Miss Minnie Leg 
When I 
was very young how fond I 
was of childisl, joys; 
I 
loved to play among the girls, but better with the boys; 
It was pussy in the corner, tag and ineminie, 
And when my ma put me in bed I 
would steel out on the 
sly. 
I 
dared not make the slightest noise when getting back in 
bed, 
The biggest boy would boost me in my window overhead; 
I 
would go to sleep and dream I 
was a 
lady young and 
gay, 
And when my ma would take me up to her I 
used to say; 
CHORUS— 
Dance me on your knee, mother, dance me on your knee; 
Clasp your arms around my waist, it wont hurt me. 
Hold me tight, don't let me fall, I 
won't be afraid at all, 
Dance me, mother, dance me on your knee. 
DANCE ME 
ON YOUR KNEE.—Concluded. 
tut when I 
wore long dresses first the little boys I 
shook, 
As my ideas developed the bigger ones I 
took. 
Instead of childish games it was parties, social balls and 
drives, 
Where'er I 
went I 
had my favorite escort by my side. 
But when I 
tire of one young man, another soon I 
take, 
For there's a 
way of knowing how to give the boys a 
quiet 
shake. 
And when I 
wish to call one back a 
smile would win the 
day— 
I 
need but look upon his face and coaxingly this say: 
Dance me on your knee, &c. 
I 
want to find a 
lover that will undertake the task, 
And understand just what I 
want, and never have to ask. 
If such can recommend himself I 
pray don't backward be, 
But be sure you're brave and strong enough to dance me 
on your knee. 
There's many a 
wish a 
young girl has she don't like to/ 
express, 
There's many a 
time we answer no, and heartily mean 
I 
always warn the fellows when we are sitting all alone, 
11,e sure don't rumple up my clothes, when you dance me 
on your knee. 
Dance me on your knee, &e.

THE $5 
NOTE. 
A 
Comic Song sung by FRANK LEWIS, ESQ., with tremendous success 
everywhere through the country. 
Written by FRED SHAW. 
One night as I 
was out with the boys to have a 
spree, 
Thro' drinking whisky punches, I 
was drunk as I 
could be; 
My cash it quickly flew, I 
very soon was broke, 
So I 
borrowed front a 
friend a $5 
note. 
Cuouus: 
If you listen to my song, while the funny things 
quote, 
I'll tell you how  I 
spent 
that e5 note. 
As soon as I 
was fixed, I 
asked the boys to have a 
bowl, 
Which into my note made a 
very big hole; 
We had a 
round of punches, and then cigars to boot, 
Up went the first dollar of the $5 
note. 
The boys feeling hungry after drinking so much punch, 
We walked around the corner and we had a 
little lunch; 
They tackled oyster stews ' till I 
thought the boys would 
choke, 
And they soon eat up a 
dollar of the $5 
note. 
Then we went to the Theatre to see the ladies prance, 
And to hear the comic songs, and the funny song and dance; 
One of the girls says I 
feel thirsty, and brandy would suit 
my throat, 
And she soon drank a 
dollar of the $5 
note. 
Then we walked around the town called in a 
saloon or two, 
Then we went to see the ladies as the young men often do; 
One said she loved me, with her arms around my throat, 
And she soon got a 
dollar of the $5 
note. 
Then as I 
was going home, just as drunk as I 
could be, 
A poor laboring man came slowly up to me; 
His family they were starving, and ragged was his coat, 
And he got the last dollar of the $5 
note.

KEEP IT MUM. 
Sang by FRANK LEWIS at Colisseum Theatre, Detroit, with great 
success, and at Theatre Comique, and at Harry Miner's Theatre, N.Y. 
About twelve o'clock upon one Winter's night, 
Keep it mum; 
When this individual came to light, 
Keep it mum; 
When I 
was a 
lad, I 
was very headstrong, 
With my teacher at school I 
could not get along; 
But I 
hope what 
tell you to-night in my song, 
You'll keep it mum. 
The husband comes home from his club late at night 
Keep it mum; 
When the sun it is shining at break of daylight, 
Keep it mum; 
He tells his dear wife he's been out with a 
friend, 
And, of course, it was business he had to attend; 
She believes all he says, ' till in nine months they send 
Well, keep it mum. 
Some wives get religion when parsons do call, 
Keep it mum; 
On a 
glass of old toddy, they glory do bawl, 
Keep it mum; 
The husband goes to labor up town, 
The parson stops at me, do not frown, 
Alone, when together, they glory rake down, 
But keep it mum. 
Now, there is Bob Ingersoll says there no hell, 
Keep it mum, 
That is the doctrine Robert- does tell, 
Keep it mum; 
Now Bobby may walk, he may preach, he may pray 
And talk about Hell in his own funny way; 
But, perhaps he will find it out some future day, 
He'll keep it mum.

SPEAK TO MY WIFE. 
Sang by NED BARRY with great success at HARRIGAN & HART'S 
Theatre Comique, N. Y. 
There's a 
great and glorious time in store, 
For husbands one and all; 
For the wives are coming to the fore, 
And husbands singing small; 
The ladies mean to do the work, 
And so, in consequence; 
The men, all trouble mean to shirk, 
Oh! won't it be immense? 
SPOKEN.—And indeed, fellows ought to be grateful to 
the darlings for waking up to the fact, that the husbands 
have maintained the wives Jong enough, and now they 
mean to have a 
turn themselves. 
By Jove! 
Won't it be 
immense? When the fellow comes for the Poor Rates, 
Water Rates, or any other Rates, to say, " Oh! If its cash 
you require, you must" 
CHORUS: 
Speak to Lucinda! 
Yes! speak to my wife! 
Speak to Lucinda! 
The pride of my life; 
She saves me all trouble, all bother and strife, 
So I 
beg that you'll speak to my wife. 
They'll have to take us out each day, 
To Concert, Ball, or Rout; 
They'll have to treat us to the play, 
To Oysters, " Cham." or Stout; 
The dears will have to find the cash, 
To meet each big expense; 
They'll pay the debts or " go to smash," 
Oh! won't it be immense? 
SPOKEN.—Oh! bless them, they shall have Woman's 
Rights, and Woman's Responsibilities, and we fellows will 
stay at home and look nice, and, I 
say, won't it be immense 
to order carte blanche from the wine-merchant and cigar. 
man, and, when they hint at a 
settlement of " the little 
account," to gently remark—. 
(Chorus) 
La. 
29 
SPEAK TO MY WIFE.—CONTINUED. 
They'll drive us down in a 
Four-in-Hand, 
To the Derby, darling pets; 
And find us seats upon the stand, 
And lay us losing bets; 
We'll have new costumes ev'ry day, 
Regardless of expense; 
And the tailors' bills they'll have to pay, 
Oh! won't it be immense? 
Si OKEN.—And when they particularly wish to take us 
anywhere, we will say, " Oh, No! really can't go; haven't 
a 
th,ng to wear." 
Then, perhaps, they'll remark, " But 
whe_e's that sweet costume you wore_ 37esterday?" 
And 
we will reply, " The idea, that thing! Why I've positively 
worn it twice." 
Oh! won't it be immense to have a 
new 
rig out from Poole for every possible occasion, with the 
definite understanding that he is to— 
(Chorus). 
To business they will go by train, 
Or on the 'bus will ride; 
And if it should come on to rain, 
They'll have to go outside; 
A 
thousand things they'll have to do, 
To their disgust intense; 
And if it only does come true, 
Oh! won't it be immense? 
SPOKEN.—Ah! but I 
fear it is too good ever to come off. 
Nothing would suit me better than to change places with 
my wife, she to take the care and anxiety of the " head of 
the family," and I 
to live a 
life of luxurious ease at her 
expense. 
Just imagine, you know, if Chips, the Banker, 
wrote to say that there wasn't sufficient cash in hand to 
meet those little pieces of paper that are flying about with 
my autograph at the tail. 
Eh! I 
say! 
Won't it be im-
mense to write back and say, " Look here, old „.... tow, its 
not my affair at all. 
You must—

GRANDFATHER'S PANTS.

My grandfather, he, at the age of eighty-three, 
One day he took a 
notion he would die; 
And after he was dead, of course the will was read, 
By a 
lawyer as we all were passing by; 
Unto my brother Bill, he left an old saw mill, 
To my sister he bequeated our gray mare, Nance. 
But when it came to me, the lawyer then,. said he 
Has left to you his old brown pants 
CHORUS: 
But how they giggled, how they yelled, 
Even my sister, my dear Isabel; 
Gave me the laugh whene'er she had the chance, 
When grandpa only left to me his old brown pants.. 
My brother Bill one day, just to paRs the time away,, 
In the river, why he thought he'd take a 
swim; 
When a 
stray goat showed his nose, and he eat up, 
poor Bill's clothes, 
It was Summer, and his garments they were thin; 
Now Bill he kicked and swore, when he couldn't 
leave the shore, 
And I 
saw his situation at a 
glance; 
I 
give one laugh and yell, I 
said now brother, Bill, 
pon't you wish you had the old brown pants.

I'll take you home again, Kathleen, 
Across the ocean wild and wide; 
To where your heart has ever been, 
Since first you were my bonny bride; 
The roses all have left your cheek, 
I've watched them fade away and die; 
Your voice is sad when e'er you speak, 
And tears bedim your loving eyes. 
CHORUS: 
Oh, I 
will take you back, Kathleen, 
To where your heart will feel no pain; 
And when the fields are fresh and green, 
I'll take you to your home again. 
I

Your heart was ever fond and true; 
I 
always feel when you are near, 
That life holds nothing dear but you.

On a 
fishball he can skate, 
Baby mine—baby mine, 
lie can eat a 
barrel of cake, 
Baby mine. 
He makes faces at the women, 
Baby mine—baby mine; 
In a 
soup bowl he goes swimming, 
Baby mine—baby mine. 
Out of the ash-pan we do yan% him; 
In his high chair we do plank him, 
Oh, heavens! how we spank him, 
Baby mine—baby mine, 
His face would cave a 
bank in. 
Baby mine. 
At the table he is queer, 
Baby mine—baby mine; 
Stuffs the pan cakes in his ear, 
Baby mine—baby mine. 
Rubs molasses on his nose, 
Spills the mustard on his clothes, 
He jails the hash between his toes, 
Baby mine— baby mine, 
And we wash him with a 
hose, 
Baby mine.

THE MAID AND THE MAGPIE. 
Sang by NED BARRY with great success in HARRIGAN & HART'S 
New Play, " Mulligan Guards' Nominee," 
Theatre Comique, N. Y. 
:0:-
Now once there was a 
maid kept an old magpie, 
And a 
parson who prayed lived very close by; 
When this maid met the parson they both stopped to talk, 
And often on the quiet go for a 
cosy walk; 
But her lover was a 
sailor who sailed across the main, 
A.nd he promised she should be his wife when he returned 
again; 
Still she let this parson see her home from church. 
And kiss her, never thinking of the magpie on the perch. 
CHORUS: 
The maid and the magpie would talk all the day, 
The maid would believe all the magpie would say; 
She said I 
love the parson, don't you tell the tar, 
When the old magpie only said " guar! guar!" 
Now, whilst this sailor was away, so the story goes, 
This maid flirts with the parson, but, of course, nobody 
knows; 
Until she tells the magpie when talking one day, 
She'd rather have the parson now the sailor was away; 
But she said don't tell this secret, or I'll give you the birch 
Every night at nine, I 
meet the parson near the church; 
The magpie only guar, quar'd as he had done before, 
But lie meant to tell the sailor boy when he returned on 
shore.

THE MAID AND THE MAGPIE.—CONTINTED. 
Whilst stationed at Gibraltar, this sailor, so it seems, 
When sleeping in his cosy bunk, he had some funny dreams; 
He dreamt the girl he'd left behind on dear old England's 
shore, 
Would, whilst he was away, flirt with half a 
dozen more; 
So he made his passage homeward as quickly as could be, 
Landed safely at her house, but no maiden could he see; 
He then talked to the magpie who was dancing on the perch, 
And the magpie told him all about the parson at the church. 
(Chorus). 
Now when the sailor met the maiden, he passed her with 
disdain, 
So she sued for breach of promise, tried five hundred to 
obtain; 
But he brought the magpie into court, which told the 
truthful tale, 
So to get what she required, this maiden did fail; 
She then went for the parson, but in vain for him did 
search, 
For he knew which way the wind blew, so he hooked it 
from the church; 
The lawyers couldn't find him, so the case went on the 
shelf, 
And this tricky little maiden had to live by herself. 
CHORUS: 
The maid and the magpie ne'eK talk all the day, 
For the jolly little sailor took the knowing bird away; 
And now with all his shipmates, this rare good hearted tar, 
While the magpie tells the trnthfnl tale, he sings " guar! 
guar!"

On the 15th of September, 
We dressed up neat and gay; 
For to join a 
grand procession, 
We at once set on our way; 
There were tinkers, tailors, scavengers 
And ladies short and tall; 
All went to see the opening 
Of our lovely City Hall. 
There was Mr. Michael Murphy, 
With a 
bran new suit of clothes; 
That was made by Johnny Doherty, 
Whom everybody knows; 
Muldoon, the solid man, was there, 
As dacent as could be; 
But there wasn't one in all the lot, 
Could equal him or me. 
CHORUS• 
Did you see the two Malones, 
With their shining, bran new hats? 
Did you see them marching off 
Like two young aristocrats? 
There were flags and banners wavino• 
And dress in style was shown; 
But the greatest swells in all the lot, 
Was Pat. and Tim Malone.

THE TWO MALONES—CONTINUED. 
The Mayor, upon the City Hall steps, 
Quite stately took his stand; 
He noticed none till we came by, 
And then he waved his hand; 
He saw at once the style was there, 
For he stared with both his eyes; 
As if he thought we were some lords 
Or dukes dressed in disguise. 
We marched all through the city, 
Till I 
thought we'd never stop; 
So I 
fell out, and then fell into 
Magee's to take a 
drop; 
The people there were talking of 
The sights they saw that day; 
We felt a 
little flattered 
When we heard the women say— (Chorus} 
We received an invitation 
To attend a 
fancy ball; 
'Without our evening dress suits, 
We couldn't go at all; 
Mr. Doherty, the tailor, 
Our measure couldn't take; 
Because, for Owney Geoghegan, sure, 
He had a 
suit to make. 
So we both went down to Baxter Street, 
Bought new suits, second hand; 
With a 
piece of shamrock in our hats, 
We looked a 
trifle grand; 
We danced about till midnight, 
And when home in the dark, 
You could scarcely walk a 
foot, 
When you'd hear some one remark—(Cho.)

In the darling little Isle across the sea, 
Where the mountains and the hills,

Our little farm was small; it could not support us all 
So one of us was forced away from home. 
And I

With a

And I 
sailed for Castle Garden all alone.

SINGING ON THE ROOF. 
Written, composed and sung by JAMES KEARNEY, with great success 
who deserves all credit of the popularity of this great song. This 
is one of the best of M R. KEARNEY'S great songs. 
Copyrighted, 1879, and published by E. 
H. 
HARDING, 22.9 Bowery 
There's sixteen dacent families 
In the house where I 
reside; 
On summer nights to cheer ourselves, 
All pleasures we have tried; 
But on the roof it's best of all, 
To hear us would be proof; 
We make the neighborhood resound, 
All singing on the roof. 
Singing on the roof, the boys and girls together, 
We play the concertina, likewise the sweet banjo; - 
The Murphys and O'Neils come up to see the weather, 
We're highly elevated until we go below. 
Now up comes Mistress Hoolahan, 
With the baby in her arms; 
With pleasant conversation then, 
Sure every one she charms; 
There's Rosy Dunn and Reiley's son, 
And a 
Russian named O'Goofe, 
With voices loud they join the crowd, 
All singing on the roof. (Chorus). 
Young Roger Flynn got up to dance. 
With a 
lady from next door; 
"Come welt the tin," says Roger Flynn, 
"It's like a 
ball-room floor;" 
Then one by one they joined the fun, 
Sure, none could hold aloof, 
It was a 
sight that summer night, 
To see them on the roof. (Chorus) 
Now that's the place to spend the night, 
And feel that pleasant breeze; 
Take up your pipe and stretch yourself, 
In an attitude of ease; 
The boys and girls will gather round, 
And fill the air with glee; 
When singing on the roof at night, 
As happy as can be. ( Chorus),

In the sweet by and by, 
We shall meet on that beautiful spore, 
In the sweet by and by, 
We shall meet on that beautiful shore. 
We shall sing on that beautiful shore, 
The melodious songs of the blest, 
And our spirits shall sorrow no more— 
Not a 
sigh for the blessing of rest. 
(Chorus). 
To our bountiful Father above, 
We will offer the tribute of praise, 
For the glorious gift of his love, 
And the blessing that I 
allow our days'.

THE IRISH BRIGADE. 
Written, composed and sung with great success, by HARRY 
W HALING. at TONY PASTOR'S THEATRE. 
Now don't be alarmed, friends, at seeing me here, 
I'm a 
gem of the very first water; 
My appearance will show I'm a 
gentleman, too, 
I'm a 
son of a 
Marquis's daughter; 
Mother, God bless her! she doted on me, 
Said of danger I 
ne'er was afraid; 
So when I 
grew to manh000d, a 
commission I 
bought, 
And I'm one of the Irish Brigade. 
Chopu,—Then hurrah, hurrah, for the true sons of Erin, 
The stout-hearted soldiers are never afraid; 
They're true to the core, and in death ever daring, 
I'm Colonel Shea of the Irish Brigade. 
The Irish Brigade is a 
corps true and brave, 
And for fighting, the best in the land; 
In peace they're true-hearted, cheerful and gay. 
While in battle like lions will stand: 
And I 
am their leader, and proud to say, 
My soldiers all dote upon me; 
For oft midst the roar of the cannon they shout, 
"Give a 
cheer, boys, for brave Colonel Shea."— Chorus. 
To the roll of the drum they march gaily on, 
Through the fields, midst the dead anti the dying; 
And 1**li in the air. through the smoke can be seen, 
The Green Flag nobly flying: 
And there it waves proudly, amid shot and shell, 
'While my men to the charge they are led. 
And they'll fig ht till they die, ere an inch they will fly, 
In defence of the flag o'er their head. 
Chorus. 
Then boys, give a 
cheer for the sons of our Isle, 
In ?-,
stlantry, none them excel; 
For their rights and their country they've oft led the was-
And like soldiers have nobly fell; 
Thee've fought and they've conquered their foes o'er and 
o'er. 
In foreign lands ovtr the sea: 
And they'd try hard again, would my stout-hearted men 
If called on by brave Colonel Shea. 
Chorus.

When silver locks replace the gold, 
I'll love you, darling, as of old,

Still shed for me their loving light, 
And on your lips I 
plainly see 
The smile that's always'clear to me.

Ere life had crept so near its clos). 
When silver locks replace the gold, 
And love with some is growing old, 
I'll cling to you with all my heart, 
And death alone our love shall part; 
Thy face no more with ruby glows, 
The lily has replaced the rose, 
But still you are to me as dear, 
Your voice is just as sweet and clear. 
When silver locks, Lc, 
When silver locks replace the gold, 
Our stories oft will be retold, 
And in life's last declining rays 
We'll catch a 
glimpse of other days; 
The hands that clasped each other true, 
The olden vigor will renew. 
And 'till life's busy dream is o'er 
I'll love you, darling, all the more.

SO 
I

And took her little hand in mine and gave it a 
squeeze.

Says she, " I 
think my appetite is very good, 
A 
pleasant meal I'd relish sir, indeed I

I'm good at ordering suppers, and I'll save your pelf 
So if you do not mind, I'll order it myself."

Parody on Babies on Our Block, 
Written and sung by Billy Carter with great sus4 
You can talk of ugly babies, 
On our block it is a 
sight, 
To see a 
thousand babies chaw 
And claw with all their might. 
There is pug-nosed babies, goggle-eyed kids, 
And some of the good old stock, 
It's a 
regular menagerie, 
The babies on the block. 
Mrs. Grady's got a 
baby 
That talked before 'twas born, 
Another by the name of Simpson, 
With a 
nose like a 
Wm. goat's horn; 
They'll get squalling and bawling, 
And they'd gather in a 
flock, 
Barnum ought to make a 
call 
On 
the babies on our block. 
CHORUS. 
Little Johnny Toothpick 
And Susan Turpentine, 
A 
crying and a 
fighting, 
And a 
singing Baby Mine; 
They'd take the chromo cake and ail 
For smashing Grandpa's clock, 
They'd win the prize for swallowing flies, 
These babies on our block. 
PARODY ON BABIES ON OUR BLOCK. —CONTINUED. 
There's an Italian kid just two years old, 
With eyes in the back of his head, 
You can guess how the daddy feels 
When the young one's hair is red; 
Some have got no eyes, and some have got no nose, 
And a 
black and tan kid 
With an elephant hoof 
And forty-'leven toes; 
Some's dramatic, some's lunatic, 
One kid has a 
wooden ear, 
Another one, they call Napoleon, 
Drinks his barrel of lager beer. 
They'll rear and tare, 
And pull their hair, 
Until your nerves they shock, 
They'll scream and yell, 
And raise old fun, 
The babies on our block. 
CHORUS. 
Little Sally Falseteeth, 
Sitting in a 
custard pie, 
A 
crying 'cause her little brother 
Slugged her in the eye. 
Rise, Sally, rise, knock his eye out with a 
rock, 
For there's a 
hundred times more babies 
Than there's daddies on our block. 
THE CANDIDATE. 
Recited by MR. J. 
F. 
SULLIVAN, of CRONIN ct SULLIVAN. 
"Father, who travels the road so late?" 
"Hush, my child; 'tis the candidate." 
Fit example of human woes— 
Early he comes and late he goes; 
He greets the women with courtly grace, 
He kisses the baby's dirty face, 
He calls to the fence the farmer at work, 
He bores the merchant, he bores the clerk, 
The blacksmith, while his anvil rings, 
He greets, and this is the song he sings: 
" 
Howdy, howdy, howdy do? 
How is your wife, and how are you? 
Ali! it fits my fist as no other can, 
The horny hand of the workingman." 
" 
Husband, who is that man at the gate?" 
"Hush, my love; ' tis the candidate." 
"Husband, why can't he work like you! 
Has he nothing at home to do?" 
My dear, whenever a 
man is down, 
No cash at home, no money in town, 
Too stupid to preach, too proud to beg, 
Too timid to rob, and too lazy to dig, 
Then over his horse his legs he flings, 
And to the dear people this song he sings: 
THE CANDIDATE—CoNTEguEn. 
" 
Howdy, howdy, howdy do? 
hIow is your wife, and how are you? 
Aid it fits my fist as no other can, 
The horny hand of the workingman." 
Brothers, who labor early and late, 
Ask these things of the candidate: 
What's his record? How does be stand 
At home? No matter about his hand, 
Be it hard or soft, so it be not prone 
To close over money not his own. 
Has he in view no thieving plan? 
Is he honest and capable?—he is our man. 
Cheer such a 
one till the welkin rings, 
Join in the chorus when thus he sings: 
" 
Howdy, howdy, howdy do? 
How is your wife, and how are you? 
Ali! it fits my fist as no other can, 
The horny hand of the workingman." 
When the Brooklyn Bridge is done. 
Written by JAMES RICHMOND, for and sung by PAT REILLY 
with great success. 
I 
am Senator McCann and ex-Alderman, 
I've refused the President's chair; 
I 
eat Webster's Dictionary for pills, 
I've made a 
fortune bottling air; 
If I 
was President, I'd have the Mississippi Riv7 
run dry, 
I'd make girls wear mustaches and pants; 
We'd have moonlight picnics in the clouds, 
And dance an Irish Can Can dance. 
CHORUS: 
I'd make all the Chinese do washing free, 
Hang the organ grinders for fun; 
Oh, I'll build an iron ladder to Heaven, 
When the Brooklyn Bridge is done. 
Dance. 
I'd put all the old maids upon the Police, 
In the Gas House I'd put Jim Blaine; 
I'd have a 
tunnel under the Atlantic Ocean, 
And have a 
law to prevent snow and rain; 
I'd paint the moon, kalsomine the clouds, 
— "Whitewash the stars and sun; 
You can live forever, have your breath insured, 
When the Brooklyn Bridge is done. 
Chorus 
See that my C1-rave ' Is Whitewashed 
Every Summer. 
Written by JAs. McAvoy expressly for the SPARKS BROTHERS, and sung 
When I've cashed in my checks, little Rosebud, 
When I 
ant six foot under the turf, 
I 
forgive you, but you played me for a 
gilly, 
You worked me for every nickel I 
was worth. 
Oh, you said I 
could look, but mustn't touch, 
And you put me in such a 
dilemma; 
But there is one little snap I 
want to fake up between ns— 
That is, see that my grave is whitewashed every summer. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, the days will come to your poison face. 
Think of how you backcapped me when I 
was living. 
Clean the snow off, when I'm planted, with a 
shovel, 
darling, 
And decorate my grave with turkeys' breasts, Thanks-
giving. 
Don't get cranky when I 
ask you to remember, 
When you used to give me taffy on the stick, 
And with your funny gags you paralyzed me— 
But, my darling, you can't say I 
ever kicked. 
I 
will meet you in the happy land of Canaan, 
Tr-la-lee, skip the sewer, for you ate my baby; 
Plant huckleberry trees in the next lot to where I'm 
planted, darling, 
And see that my grave is kept shady. 
Oh the days will come, L'cc.

You'll find You're the Winner in the End. 
Sang by NED BARRY at the THEATRE COMIQUE, N. 
Y. 
Air—True as Steel. 
All this life is but a 
race, of men to gain a 
place, 
Of wealth, destruction, and a 
happy home; 
Some may come in away behind, but you'll very often 
find, 
That many a 
noble man is left alone; 
But my advice to all my friends to-night, 
Although you're poor, look manly, stern and bright; 
Love your neighbor as you ought, and when life's 
battle's fought, 
You'll find that you're the winner in the end. 
It was just eight years ago, on a 
night of storm and 
snow, 
When a 
beggar, thinly clad, stood on the street; 
A 
rich Banker passes by, but stopped at that sad cry, 
Of a 
penny, just to buy some bread to eat; 
Does he help him as he should, I 
ask of you, 
No! he scorns him just as rich men often do; 
And the beggar with a 
sigh, says my time is by-and-by 
And he'll find that I'm the winner in the end. 
Now the years have past and gone, and the subject of 
my song, 
I 
will prove, if you will listen for a 
while; 
Now the Banker he is poor, even riches are not sure, 
And the Beggar he has riches, wealth and style; 
With cold and bitter hunger, nearly dead, 
The Banker asks the Beggar for some bread; 
And the pityful cry is heard, he gives him money with 
the words, 
-You have found that I'm the winner in the end. 
Now 
in this, our glorious town, as I've very often found 
There's a 
hundred just such cases every day; 
Gold is all you need, you'll find, to prosper bear in mind 
It's the king of all the nation people say; 
Our country's been in trouble near and far, 
Peace and honesty seems like a 
distant star; 
We'll reform and do our best, with victory on our crest, 
You'll find we'll be the winners in the end.

Little porous plaster Jangles Esquire, 
has bunions on his ear; 
His neck-tie is a 
pair of pants, 
He is inspector of state beer; 
He picks up buts to eat them, 
his breath would pull a 
car; 
lie ain't changed his shirt in seven years, 
In his nose there is a 
banjo or guitar. 
CHORUS: 
Little Soloman Jangles, 
The worst of all the bums; 
Can bite cast-iron with his teeth, 
And walk upon his gums; 
He is the daisy lusher. 
He never will say no; 
He has signed two years' contract now, 
In Flotida shoveling snow. 
His cheek is as hard as iron, 
He'll drink kerosene oil or blow out the lamp; 
He is got a 
barrel of medals, 
For being the champion tramp ; 
He has been sentenced to be hung four times, 
For killing a 
German tailor; 
And every time he did escape, 
By getting stuck upon the jailer.

sent to any address on receipt of priee, 40 cents. 
There's a 
pretty little maiden, 
That I 
ever shall adore, 
In Italy that bright and sunny land; 
My life would be a 
pleasure, 
I 
would wish for nothing more, 
If she would only share my heart and hand; 
Her father is a 
brigand, 
On a 
lonely mountain pass, 
And with him on the mountain she does dwell; 
There is no titled lady, 
In all Europe can surpass, 
That dear Italian girl I 
love so well. 
CHORUS: 
Though her father is a 
brigand on the mountain, 
She's as gentle as the daughter of an Earl; 
And although she set me free, 
My heart will ever be, 
A captive to that dear Italian girl. 
While roaming lovely valleys, 
'Neath the blue and sunny skies, 
A band of sturdy brigands bold and strong, 
Did capture me, and helpless, 
with a 
bandage o'er my eyes, 
A 
victim, I 
was quickly led along, 
Five thousand pounds as ransom, 
They demanded I 
should pay, 
But that I 
was not rich enough to give, 
And only for the pleadings 
Of that little mountain maid, 
They would not have permitted me to live. 
(Chorus 
They put me in a 
dungeon 
Where I 
thought that I 
should die, 
And while the brigand chief with all his band, 
Were plundering poor travelers, 
This lovely girl came nigh, 
In gloomy night and by my side did stand; 
She tore my bands asunder, 
Bade me rise and quickly fly, 
And from her fathers coffers gave me gold; 
And while the tears of love and pity, 
Glistened in her eye, 
The secrets of our hearts were plainly told. 
(Chorus). 
bid her then to fly with me, 
And be my darling bride, 
Although her love for me was plainly shown, 
Her duty she declared, 
Was by her outlawed father's side, 
And so to America I 
returned alone; 
But I 
cannot live forever 
In this free and happy land, 
To Italy I'm going to return, 
To seek with love, and try to win, 
If only for awhile, 
That girl for whom my heart will ever yearn. 
(Chorus).

CUMBERLAND'S CREW. 
Sung with great success by Devlin & Tracy. 
Oh shipmates, come, gather and join in my ditty, 
It's of a 
terrible battle that happened of late; 
Let each good Union-Tar shed a 
sad tear of pity, 
When he thinks of the once gallant Cumberland's fate. 
The eighth day of March told a 
terrible story, 
And many a 
brave tar to this world bid Adieu! 
Vet our Flag it was wrapt in a 
mantle of glory, 
By the heroic deeds of the Cumberland's crew. 
On that ill-fated day about ten in the morning, 
The sky it was clear, and bright shone the sun; 
The drums of the Cumberland sounded a 
warning 
That told every seaman to stand by his gun. 
An Iron-clad Frigate down on us came bearing, 
And high in the air the Rebel Flag flew; 
The Pennant of Treason she proudly was waving, 
Determined to conquer the Cumberland's crew. 
Then up spoke our Captain with stern resolution, 
Saying: my boys, of this monster now don't be dismayed. 
We swore to maintain our beloved Constitution, 
And to die for our country we are not afraid! 
We fight for the Union, our cause it is glorious, 
To the Stars and Stripes we will stand ever true ; 
We'll sink at our quarters, or conquer victorious! 
Was ansv.'ered,with cheers,from the Cumberland's cre\N 
Now our gallant ship fired her guns' dreadful thunder, 
Her broad-side, like hail, on the Rebel did pour. 
The people gazed on, struck with terror and wonder, 
The shots struck her sides and glanced harmless o'er; 
57 
CUMBERLAND'S CREW.—Continued. 
But the pride of our Navy could never be daunted, 
Tho' the dead and the wounded her deck they did strew; 
And the Flag of the Union, how proudly it flaunted, 
Sustained by the blood of the Cumberland's crew. 
Slowly they sunk beneath Virginia's waters, 
Their voices on earth will ne'er be heard more— 
They'll be wept by Columbia's brave sons and fair daughters 
May their blood be avenged on Virginia's shore !— 
In that battle stained grave they are silently lying— 
Their souls have forever to earth bid Adieu !— 
But the Star-Spangled Banner above them is flying, 
It was nailed to the mast by the Cumberland's crew. 
They fought us three hours, with stern resolution, 
Till those Rebels found cannon would never avail them: 
For the Flag of Secession has no power to gall them, 
Tho' the blood from their scuppers it crimsoned the tide; 
She struck us amid-ship, our planks she did sever, 
Her sharp iron-prong pierced our noble ship through; 
And still, as they sank on that dark rolling river, 
We'll die at our guns! cried the Cumberland's crew. 
Columbia's sweet birth- right of Freedom's communion, 
Thy Flag never floated so proudly before; 
For the spirits of those that died for our Union, 
Above its broad folds now exaltingiy soar !— 
And when our sailors in battle assemble, 
God bless our dear Banner: the Red, White and Blue! 
Beneath its bright Stars we'll cause tyrants to tremble, 
Or sink at our guns, like the Cumberland's crew.

The Greatest Trick Book of the Age. 
1-111FIPTY DIEYIPTY 
IT PLEASES BOTH OLD AND YOUNG, 
it is a Pac simile of a Trick practiced by ali 
the Professors of Magic. 
It is arranged so systematically, and is accom-
panied with directions so plainly written, that, with 
a 
single perusal, any person may become an adept 
in an unfailing source of amusement. 
Bead what a leading Journal says of it: 
" 
An ingenious little book of the thaumaturgic order 
has been sent us, called HUMPTY DIIMPTY,' and bound 
in such a 
way as to give opportunity for a 
decidedly 
puzzling trick. 
While presenting the ordinary appear, 
ance of a 
child's picture-book, gayly printed and colored, 
it is so bound that a 
practiced manipulator, taking it 
up, and flirting the leaves rapidly over, can make it ap-
pear to be filled with copies of only one picture, or with 
blank pages, or with any one of quite a 
succession of 
figures. 
One minute the pamphlet, quickly thumbed, 
appears to contain nothing but portraits of Harlequin, 
in his tesselated suit; the next, only Columbine; then, 
nothing but Pantaloon, or Riding Hood, or Mephisto-
pheles. A 
little practice, and the directions printed 
with the book will make anybody at . home in the hand-
ling of it."—Phila. Evening Bulletin.
