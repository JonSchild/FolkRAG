Interview with Heather Hill, afc2016037_04000 
July 19, 2017 
Interviewed at Renaissance Funeral Home, Raleigh, NC, by Sarah Bryan for Folklife of 
the Funeral Services Profession 
Sarah Bryan: Let me ask you to introduce yourself for the recording, and tell me where 
we are today. 
Heather Hill: My name is Heather Hill, and Fm a funeral director at Renaissance 
Funeral Home in Raleigh, North Carolina. 
SB: And how long have you been doing this sort of work, and how did you get 
started? 
HH: I've been here at this funeral home for three years. I've been licensed almost 
exactly a year this month. So I've been licensed a year, but I did a two-year 
apprenticeship. I came here—I actually used to be a web designer, and then I did one of 
those career-builder websites one night, and typed in all my answers to the responses, 
and "funeral director" came up. And I slapped my head and said, "Oh yeah. This is 
awesome." And so I became a —I started school two weeks later. I'd had other careers in 
the past, but this is, I think, what that was building up to all these years. 
SB: What sort of other careers had you been doing before? 
HH: Ah. I started off as a bank teller, then I was a chiropractic assistant, then I was a 
vet tech, then I was an x-ray tech. And then I became a flight attendant, and that's 
where I met my husband. And then I went back to school to be a CT tech, realized that's 
not what I wanted to do. Then I did web design. (Laughs.) Little bit of everything. 
SB: Little bit of everything. 
HH: Yeah. Web design was the last thing before I went into this. 
SB: So a lot of those, it sounds to me, are caring professions, and working with 
people and helping people. 
HH: I guess that's what I'm drawn to, and that's why the web design thing didn't 
work, because I— Well, I had children at home, so I wanted to do something I could do 
at home. And I didn't continue with that because I wasn't getting a lot of personal— 
personal—personal time with people. And I wasn't doing things that I cared about. I 
realized I didn't like doing it anymore when I was doing websites for lawyers, or for 
things I didn't care about. When I was doing charity websites or some of my own 
websites, then I really had a passion for it, so I'm glad I took that career test at 3 AM. 
There it was. Before I started school, I came to this funeral home to speak to a director, 
because Td never been in the business before. Lot of people are raised in the business 
and this is their life, so I came and talked to Joe—Joe III, his father is also a funeral 
director. I said, "Give me the ins and outs. Tm about to start school, I don't know 
anything about this career." And he gave me the good and the bad. He said, you know, 
"You're going to be rewarded by helping people, but the hours are really crazy, and 
you see a lot of things that are hard. And so — didn't stop me. I continued to enroll in 
school, and then I came back. Kept in touch with him when it was time for an 
apprenticeship, and they had just finished up with another apprentice, and then I was 
able to step in. So I think it helped they were—I think they had in mind they were 
looking for a female. So I was at the right place at the right time, 'cause apprenticeships 
are hard to come by in this area. So I was really happy to stay on here. It's the only place 
I've been. 
SB: I've heard that a lot more women are becoming part of this profession. 
HH: Mm-hm. I'm not sure of the statistic, but it's a very high statistic of the people in 
school now are females. Yeah. 
SB: And how did you come to Raleigh? You said you're from Ohio originally? 
HH: Yeah, I'm from Ohio. I was a flight attendant, and I met my husband because we 
both worked for Corporate airline, and that was out of Cleveland. And then I was his 
flight attendant, he was my pilot, and we flew together all the time, and we fell in love. 
And then he had a condo in Florida, so it was either Ohio or Florida, Ohio or Florida; so 
we chose Florida. And then we got married, had children, and then we needed to sell 
the house. And my family was from Ohio, and I wasn't used to not having seasons 
down there, and I wanted to move halfway up. (Laughs.) And his mom lives in 
Durham, so it was a nice transition for us. So I wanted some seasons, but I didn't want 
the weather in Ohio. That's what brought me to Raleigh, just simply that. 
SB: That's great. Was he from Durham originally? 
HH: He moved to Durham when he was a senior in high school, with his mom, and 
then went off to flight school. And didn't spend much time there, but knew that he was 
gone all the time, and I had three kids, so — we had three kids (laughs) — I had three kids 
at home alone, so we wanted to be somewhere where I had a backup, just in case. That's 
what answered that call. And I like this area now. This is where we've planted our roots 
and we'll stay here now. 
SB: And what was your schooling like in this field? 
HH: All of my classes — I went through Fayetteville Tech, which, for those in the 
business know, in North Carolina, you can do either funeral director or embalming. 
And I started off doing just funeral director, then I moved to embalming, and then life 
situation—my husband passed away —and then I decided I needed to finish school and 
just get working. 
[0:05:00] And so — but in a small funeral home, Tm able to at least assist. I don't 
need to stay up front and be just with the families, or stay in the back and be just with 
bodies. So I like being able to do a little bit of everything. And we do a little bit of 
everything here, so I can still do hair and help dress, and assist with embalming. But I 
can't do embalming on my own, because I'm just a —not just a funeral director—I'm 
licensed as a funeral director, not an embalmer. 
SB: One thing that really interests me about funeral directors and embalmers and 
morticians is that I think it's natural that we're born with sort of a fright of dead bodies. 
HH: Mm-hmm. 
SB: How— Are people in your field not born with that? Or is it something that you 
have or get past because of your work? 
HH: I can tell you my experience. When I worked as an x-ray tech I worked in the 
hospital. And I had watched some autopsies, and it was fascinating. It was really 
fascinating to me. In not a morbid way, but in an anatomical way. And to actually see 
how everything works. I mean. I'd seen them in pictures, I studied anatomy for years, 
so to actually see a picture, to see it in real life, was fascinating. I had to x-ray somebody 
who had died, and that was the first time I'd actually touched a dead body. And that 
was when I was in my twenties. So I wasn't scared then. And then when I started here, I 
didn't know whether or not I could do embalming, because I didn't know how it would 
be with actually really working with the bodies — with, you know, lifting arms and 
dressing and everything. And I watched a few, and I said, "I'm okay with this." I don't 
have a fear of bodies. Of the dead. Would I want to sleep alone in a funeral home with a 
lot of dead? Probably, maybe I do have a little fun. Like, I don't know if I'd want to 
sleep here alone. Maybe I would. I don't know yet. (Laughs) Maybe I will, maybe I'll try 
that. I'd love to know if there's something scary about it. I've never experienced 
anything to frighten me. So. I've met more people that frighten me than the dead. 
(Laughs) 
SB: I'm so interested in the Death Cafe, and that phenomenon. Can you tell me a bit 
about that? 
HH: Yes! The Death Cafe is — You first tell people, "Death Cafe," "What the heck is 
that?" It is a conversation. It's basically a conversation that brings up every aspect, or 
whatever anybody wants to talk about, whether it's planning for your own death, 
preparing the documents that you need, or dealing with somebody that's dying. Grief. 
Ghosts. Afterlife. We talk about it all. We don't have an agenda. I've found — I started 
this, I think it's almost a year ago that we started doing this, and interest has grown a 
lot. And people leave so thankful, and saying, "This is a conversation we need to have. 
This is an important conversation." You hear this from people who have tried to speak 
to their own loved ones about planning for their own death, and people, our society, 
doesn't want to think about death or be cognizant of the fact that we're all going to die. 
And so we're afraid of it, we're afraid of the unknown, I think is what it is. But that's 
what we love about this, is that it brings these topics out, and it's okay to talk about. 
And somebody'll come, and they're like, "Finally! I feel like I can talk to people that are 
interested in this." It doesn't make you morbid. It doesn't make you goth. It doesn't 
make you odd. It makes you curious about your own death, and by being faced with 
death, you're able to live the best life that you can, because you know that you're going 
to die. And that's simple to say, "You know you're going to die," but people don't think 
about it. If you think about what kind of, you know, personal legacy you want to leave. 
So I think it brings up those topics, of people being able to think about how they want 
to be remembered, or taking care of loose ends, or things to give their loved ones to be 
able to plan and let them know what their needs are. And we talk a lot about grief as 
well. So — and how different it is for everybody else. So it's a great conversation. It's two 
hours, and sometimes I'm sure we all wish it was four. And we get a lot of great 
feedback about it. And I love the fact that we started — we started with about nine or 
ten, and we're up to about 25 now. And I think we might have to start dividing into 
groups now, because it's so popular. 
SB: That's great. Did that originate here? 
HH: No, Death Cafe is an international project started by actually a gentleman who 
just died. 
[0:10:05] His name is John Underwood. In London, I think, it actually originated. It 
is, it's worldwide. You can get on the website and see all the different countries and 
different places that are doing this conversation that I think is really important to have. I 
don't think we talk about it enough, and I think it's conversations that we need to have, 
to make people less fearful. 
SB: What are—this goes back to something that you were talking about earlier — can 
you talk more about the sort of, what draws people to the Death Cafe? Is there a typical 
member? 
HH: Well, we have a lot of members that are end-of-life advocates, because they don't 
have anywhere else to talk to people that are of like mind. We have a lot of death doulas 
that come, a lot of hospice workers. By saying that, it's not all professionals. We have 
people, we have a lady that is, she's an author, and she writes some sci-fi stuff, and she 
likes the morbid side of talking about death. We have some older folks that have some 
illnesses, or have been through a death, and were unhappy with the person not having 
the death that they wanted to have by planning their end-of-life decisions. And so 
they're trying to change that for themselves. And there's not enough people for them to 
talk about [it] with them. So it gives them a chance to come in and talk with like-minded 
people, where it's okay to say, "You know what? I don't want to be on a respirator. I 
don't want this, and how can I make sure that doesn't happen?" And also — I've made a 
lot of people come that I know (laughs), and they've told friends, and they told friends. 
There's some folks that we work with through the churches who work directly with 
families, and they're interested in the topic. I think somebody asked last time, "My 
mom doesn't want to talk about planning for herself. What are ways that I can bring 
this up to her?" And there was a lot of people who gave ideas. We have a lovely couple 
who come in, and they lost their daughter 17 years ago. So they have a great—they have 
great discussions about how they've, they deal with their grief. So it's just — I feel like 
I'm giving you different answers, but it's just a hodgepodge of what we talk about. And 
so it's a lot of caregivers, some of the public, a lot of the people that I've drug in 
(laughs), just people that find out by sharing it with somebody else that are interested. 
SB: I saw on the web link that you sent— I thought it was interesting that there was a 
note that said that, "This is not a support group." 
HH: Mm-hmm. 
SB: But it sounds like it may indirectly have that benefit. 
HH: Well, it does, indirectly, because grief is a part of death. And life. I think that also 
we put that there because people might not have heard of Death Cafe, and they may 
think that this is somewhere they can get help. There's no doctors there, there's no 
professional advice given. It's just talk. So I did that mostly for the public that wasn't 
interested — or wasn't knowledgeable of what a Death Cafe is. And we have had 
experiences where somebody has come in and lost someone, and the conversation is 
just about that. And as a moderator I try to — "Okay, we've been talking twenty 
minutes about grief, okay, so let's talk about something else." So I try to answer 
everybody's questions, when they want to talk about what happens to a body when 
they're decomposing, as opposed to how to deal with grief. So it's a lot of different 
topics at once. 
SB: And what is that like for you moderating, what is that experience like? 
HH: It's — I love it. I love it. There's only been a few times where it's gotten away, 
where I've had to kind of draw it back in, and that's when some of the grief stuff— And 
nobody's going to interrupt somebody talking about them losing somebody. And nor 
do I want to. But I like the— And it's easy to do, because each conversation leads into 
something else that somebody else is interested in. So it's not like I throw out, "Oh, do 
you want a green burial or do you want to be embalmed?" And there's never crickets. 
It's like, "No, I want to do this." "No, I want to be cremated." So anything that I change 
to is always something that somebody is interested in talking about. And it's never my 
idea. I just — also, when we go around the room and intro everybody, I ask what they 
want to talk about, and if I remember that this lady wanted to talk about a burial, then 
I'll bring that up. Or remember Jessica wanted to talk about this. So it's interesting and 
fun, and I love how thankful people are when they leave that we're having this 
discussion. And that makes it even more important. And I love it. 
SB: I think it's great. It's something I'm thinking I should come to myself. 
HH: Mm-hm! Mm-hm. 
SB: I would be really interested. 
[0:15:00] Now, in terms of your work here, how do these skills carry over? I would 
think being a moderator you're a listener, as well as a guide. 
HH: I think you have to — I think you really have to feel people, which sounds kind of, 
um, basic. But you really need to know when somebody needs to talk about something. 
I mean, of course, being a good listener. But you have to move things along. But if 
you're making arrangements, once the arrangements are done, then you sit and talk. 
And that conversation can lead to so many different things. Somebody will come back 
to pick up death certificates, and you just can tell—it's a widow, everybody's gone, left 
from the funeral. And that's a lot of times where we have a lot of the great 
conversations, when they come back in to pick up their death certificates. You know, 
there's an onslaught of people for the funeral, and then it's crickets. So I find that that's 
when I have the best conversations with a lot of the people that have lost somebody, is 
after the fact, after everybody has gone, because there's so much support during—I'm 
trying to remember the rest of the question you asked! — how that pulls over. So being a 
good listener is— And we have to pull on so many different talents too. You know, 
besides being, you know, being able to talk to somebody, you also — I have a strong 
graphics background, so I'll make prayer cards, and I'll take somebody's photo who's 
got, you know, four people in it from Grandpa's anniversary party, and be able to crop 
out his picture, and do really nice things with it, make it look like a portrait. So I think 
that's an important asset that I give to the families. Also making programs for them, 
and assisting with the obituary, and a lot of the slideshows. So I like to be able to give 
that gift, the graphic type of gifts, to them too, as well as the prayer cards. So I think 
that's a good talent to have. You have to be —I've found it's helpful to be really good 
with the computer, because all of our things are on the computer, I can help them 
navigate their way through things too and help them with links for attorneys and 
following up with the estate. And then being able to be on your feet all day, and being 
able to do somebody's hair. So there's a lot of different—we wear many, many hats. We 
can be babysitter, we can help prepare food (laughs), we will prepare for the body, and 
take care of all of the clerical stuff as well. So there's —having a lot of different skills is 
really helpful, and I think that's been helpful for me, with the graphics and the web 
background that I have. And I enjoy doing that. When somebody gives me — and I think 
that's why I brought that up first—when somebody gives me a picture that, you know, 
it's a torn picture from a frame, that's moisturized, and I can—has a lot of moisture 
damage to it— and I can take that photo and make it look— I'm not a genius on 
Photoshop, but I can really help it. And that's all you have left when somebody dies. 
You know? And I didn't realize that. And it's really important, when you can fix that 
picture, to have them be able to cherish that memory. I like that part of it. If you can't 
tell. (Laughs) 
SB: It's really interested me—I mean, I was telling you before we started recording 
about my friend Beacham, who partly inspired this whole project, and talking about his 
ancestors, and also other funeral directors I've met who um, have talked about earlier 
generations in this profession—it's really amazed me how many skills —and things that 
a lot of people would make an entire career out of, just one of the skills — you know, the 
clinical side, the legal side, the counseling aspects. And in your case, it really strikes me 
how many, with each passing generation, how many new skills are added. I mean, it 
doesn't sound like—maybe people are not carpenters anymore, building the coffins, but 
you are doing web design, and the graphic design. 
HH: Mm-hm. Skills change with the times. And a lot of people want to do — you 
know, the ages of the people that are passing are hopefully eighties and nineties, and 
their fifty- and sixty-year-old children are more computer-savvy. So you know, it does 
change a lot. From what I've heard, and like I said I've only been in the industry three 
years, funeral directors and funeral homes are the slowest thing to keep up with trend. 
[0:20:00] So I think that's slowly happening. We're finally getting to where we 
should be, trend-wise. You know, with computers and online obituaries and online 
arrangements. There should never been online arrangements, but there are some folks 
that are doing that, where everything is completely online; and that will never be a 
trend, nor will I ever think that's okay. You know. And that's where service comes in. 
That's why we offer a service. 
SB: How do you—you're one of the youngest people in this profession I've 
interviewed — how do you as a younger member of this profession— 
HH: Female. 
SB: — and female, how do you see your role as being different from, say, the people 
who've come before you? 
HH: See, I've only worked here, so I know that I'm very respected here. Our manager 
is younger than I am. I think in the industry, from the talk that I have — and more so 
with the public. I'll go to a church, and the pastor will come up and shake the 
associate's hand, and not realize that it's me. And it doesn't bother me. I'll just 
introduce myself. I don't know what people's first impressions are when they walk in 
and see that they're meeting with me. Because by the time they're done, I think they feel 
like they're being very well taken care of. Personally, in the three years that I've been 
only at one funeral home, I have not felt any competition with men or with older folks. 
The gentleman who I work with who's been doing this for over twenty years, he's been 
a very, very good teacher, and we work so well together because he's old-school—he's 
probably done three, four thousand embalmings — he knows the ropes. And then I come 
in, and I know the computer. And we excel in our own way, so we're like yin and yang 
together. We're like one person and we work really well together, so I think if you have 
a combination of that old-school integrity—not that we don't have integrity—but the 
old-school tradition, and then a fresh mind works really well together, I think. Because I 
came in with no funeral home experience, and I think we've made a good mixture of 
who we are as one. "Who we are as one" — sounds like a t-shirt. But I don't feel— I think 
in general— I'll tell you, when I was looking to find somewhere to work, I was going to 
the about-me pages and looking for a funeral home that had younger-looking folks. I 
know that sounds bad! I pictured a stuffy old man in a suit and, like, "Oh, god. I'm not 
going to feel comfortable there," being myself, you know? Because I'm not a somber, 
[uses Alfred Hitchcock voice] "Good evening" type of person. I was looking for someone 
that I thought I could get along with, and I'd be able to work with day-to-day in an 
industry where you still have to smile, you still have to enjoy who you're working with 
and try to make the best of it. And that's what I've found here. That's why I love it here. 
SB: And I think it's so cool that I came in and your kids are here. 
HH: Yeah. [Laughs] We put them to work. Well, after my husband passed away, my 
best friend moved in with me. She takes care of the kids, and I go to work full-time. She 
helps us set up, and school's out, so— And they love being in the chapel, because 
there's such a great acoustics in there. And they go in there and sing, and they play 
scary music, and make it echo. And they're intrigued by that. Yeah, and they're 
welcome here—you know, to a point. They would like to write on our whiteboard. 
When I interviewed, that first time when I came in to talk to Joe, my daughter was in 
the car, and she actually cried when I was in here. Like, "I don't want you working 
there. Mommy." And now it's like, [sighs] rolls her eyes at it. It's no big deal. And some 
of her friends think it's cool. They either think it's cool or gross that their mom's a 
funeral director. I think that's kind of neat. 
SB: I was actually going to ask exactly that, what do your kids friends think about it? 
HH: Mm-hmm. And what's really, I hope for this year, is they have truck fairs and 
career days. They call it a truck fair — and we didn't do this when I was in school, I 
didn't know what it was —where we will take the hearse to middle schools, and the 
sixth graders come around to each station, and they ask about our careers. And I 
couldn't wait, because my daughter's in sixth grade this year, and I couldn't wait to go 
to her school so I could embarrass her a little bit, and she could say, "That's my mom." 
You know. And they canceled the one at her school this year. So I'm like, if she does it 
next year at her school, hopefully she can pop in and see me. I was really looking 
forward to that point, but. Yeah. I don't want her to get made fun of or anything. 
[0:25:00] If she tells people, she must be proud of it. "Maybe someday you can do 
this." "No, Mom." [Laughs] We'll see. 
SB: May I ask you a bit about your husband's passing, and how that's affected your 
career? 
HH: I don't mind talking about that at all. No, what a lot of people think is that I went 
into this after he passed, because I was so moved by the experience. And that's not what 
happened. I was actually in school—I'm really bad with dates, but I think I was in 
school for almost two years, I think I started in 2012 or '13. So I had been in school, and I 
had just secured an apprenticeship here. I think I started in October. So I had some 
book-work behind me. And then I started here, and two months later he passed away. 
So I had already been established and knew a little bit. He was a pilot for JetBlue, and 
he was on a layover in San Diego, and didn't show up for his trip. And he had ruptured 
his aorta and passed away in his sleep. So I got a call on Saturday morning, "the call," 
as I call it, the day. And I'm thankful that I had this —you know, I had the psychology 
classes about telling the kids the truth, not to hide it, not to say "Daddy's sleeping and 
not waking up." You know. I'm glad I had the support for my background for this, and 
the folks here, hands-down, took excellent care of me. And because he was in 
California, my owner knew somebody who knew somebody out there that would take 
good care of him and then bring him back, and then everything was here. And so I 
think, aside from my personal dealing with that grief and with the children, I came back 
to work almost two weeks later—which seems quick, but I needed to get, I needed a 
purpose, I needed to get out of the house. Just today somebody viewed somebody who 
died in that same room that I walked through to view my husband. So as they're 
walking in the room, I can't say I know what they're feeling, but I understand where 
they were when they walked — I said, "I've walked that same path." Before, I 
remember—a friend of mine, one of my daughter's teachers, grew up in a funeral home, 
and before I started here, I said, "What do I say to people when I walk in? 'Hello, Mrs. 
Smith, I'm sorry for your loss?' Like, what do you say?" I was a little awkward on how 
to — It was almost like it was a different language that you speak to people that are 
grieving. But after my husband died I didn't have to think about it. It just happened. 
You know when there's people that are more formal, and there's people that will tell 
you their life story, and there's people that just need you to sit with them, maybe quiet. 
And I think that honed that skill for me more. I didn't have to think about it. It just was 
there. And I think that helped me deal with people. And it's like. I'm healing myself by 
being here. These are my people. "My people!" I don't know why I said that in a New 
York accent. "You know, I know a guy..." These are my people, literally. I don't know 
what they're going through but I know the steps that they take. Today when I met with 
that family, the lady asked me, "How do you do this?" She's like, "How do you do this 
now?" And I said, "I know where I am now. In no way are you ever going to heal from 
grief, but I know that I've been over that hump, and I'm sitting here with you guys and 
you're crying, and I know you're upset, but I know you're going to be okay. And that 
hope, that you're going to be okay, helps me to not break down with you." And so I 
don't know if that's resonating, but that really is truthful, because I'll look at them, and 
it's really hard, but I know they're going to be okay. And I know that maybe — as we 
talk about in the Death Cafe —maybe they'll see something positive from that death. 
You know, somebody that lost a parent, maybe they'll bond with that other parent. The 
lady that I work with who lost her daughter, she's now helping people. So while a 
death is tragic and — well, not always tragic — while a young death can be tragic, you 
can make something positive out of it. And that's not wrong to say. And while I would 
rather have my husband back. I think I'm able to hold their hand a little differently, I 
think. And I'm not ashamed or sad that I'm doing that. You know what I mean? I'm 
proud that I'm able to take something from that, and help people. You know? I've had 
widows that—their dads have passed, and they're like, "Do I let my kids see? Do I let 
them view? How do I talk—"And I can say, "I went through it. Here's how it was for 
me. Nobody's the same, but here was my thought on it." And then also when it comes 
to filing the estate and legal parts, "Here's what I went through, and here's who you can 
contact." 
[0:30:04] The register of deeds, that was really helpful to me. "And make sure you 
gather this item." Well, that's all facts, to actually go through it. You can say, "They told 
you do that, but you don't need to now." So I think everything that I can take good 
from that. I'm going to. And that's been helpful. I sound really positive about it—it's 
not always that great. That's how I've chosen to deal with it, is by— And it's an honor 
to be with somebody when they're going through the worst day of their life. It literally 
is, it's a vulnerable honor to be with somebody, and I take that very seriously. 
And it is — I went and checked on them while they were viewing, and I was like, "Are 
you okay? Do you need anything?" And just sat and talked. That's as vulnerable and as 
honorable a thing you could do. I'm really thankful to be able to do that. 
SB: It must mean a lot to them too, to be able to connect to somebody who 
understands. 
HH: I've heard that. I've heard people say—especially, not just people who are in my 
position, but somebody with kids, like, "Wow, I'm glad that we came here, because you 
have gone through it. You really have another angle to be able to help us." And you 
know, I get a lot of people that say, "That's very helpful." And that reiterates why I'm 
doing this. It makes it all worthwhile. And some people say, "Oh you're just saying it, 
it's helpful. Thank you for helping me, I appreciate your words," but it really does. I 
mean, that's why we do this, is to get that reaction. That's what we strive for. Not just 
for the reaction, but for you to feel that way, that we really help. It's a true feeling. 
SB: Can I ask what your husband's first name was? 
HH: Jon. 
SB: Jon. And how old was he when he passed? 
HH: Jon. Forty-three. Jonathan—he went by Jon. Yeah. We were married 10 years. 
And I got three—12, 9, and 10. Well, they're 12, 9, and 10 now, and he died December of 
'14, so it'll be three years this December. 
SB: I'm so sorry. 
HH: Thank you. 
SB: Your kids are beautiful. 
HH: Thank you. 
SB: I was really glad to meet them. 
HH: Two of them are literally spitting images of him. Like, I can't—especially — well, 
the boys are built like him, so the bigger they get the more I can see my husband. And 
it's really— Yeah, I have to sit back sometimes, because they look so much alike. I gasp 
a little bit, like— I know when they get older they're going to look even more like him. 
So. And I look back, and I think of that, and I think, wow, they're literally a part of him. 
Well. But then that's hard too, because they're missing out. I saw band night, parent 
band night, and dads escorting the daughters. And then my neighbors all look at me 
because they know I'm going to be tearing up, knowing that she's not going to have her 
dad to walk her on Senior Night. So I mourn for them a lot. You know. But they're 
doing okay, you know? For now. You know. We talk about him, and they're processing, 
and hopefully it will affect their lives in a positive way. Maybe they'll be hands-on 
dads, like he was. You know. That's how I choose to see it right now. That's what gets 
me through. (Laughs) You got to do what works for you. 
SB: Thank you for sharing about your family. 
HH: Sure. Tm fine to share. I love to share about it, and my little ornery kids. (Laughs) 
SB: Where does — You've talked a little bit about the interpersonal relations with the 
people you work with. What does — can you sort of walk me through that relationship, 
from, you know, receiving the call to — ? 
HH: Yeah. I'm trying to give examples of what has happened. Usually I'll meet 
somebody at the door. You know, when you first start out with meeting with 
somebody. I've found what works with me is you need to build their trust. They're not 
going to instantly pour out everything, or know that you're a good person and not out 
to take them for all your money. And so I usually start with the vitals first, because 
that's the easiest answers, usually. And then the vital talk usually brings up things. 
"Well, he was a waiter." "Oh really? Where did he work?" So you kind of build up your 
conversation then. And then after the vitals are done and you've already got a little bit 
of a rapport, then you start talking about service and what you can do for them. Like, 
"Well, let's personalize this. What do you think of this? And we can do slideshows. 
What do you think of this? And show me your favorite picture of him." And then 
things start to open up. Maybe I'll share with them; I don't tell everybody, "By the way. 
I'm Heather, and I'm a widow, and I'm going to be able to help you." 
[0:35:00] Sometimes I share it and sometimes I don't. And sometimes it just comes 
up in conversation. "Well, I know that I need 25 death certificates." I'm like, "No, you 
don't. I've been through this." And they're like, "You have?" "Yeah, actually, I only 
needed this many, and I know every situation's — " Because there's an old-school 
thought that you need like 25 death certificates. You don't really need that many. So 
that's where it comes up, that I may have a little bit, know what you need. And then it 
goes to — usually then it moves on to the type of service, and that I can make this 
picture, and I can make this picture pretty. And that you don't need to choose an urn 
right now, let's decide that later, because you guys have a lot going on right now, and 
let's just get the service done." And they appreciate —they're making a lot of tough 
decisions, and I know that when things are in print, it's harder to see. I know when I 
first saw my husband's obituary in print. So I don't know if many people realize that, 
but certain things that triggered me I think might trigger somebody else. So when it's 
time to do the things that are in print. I'll even say, "This is hard, I know." To sign the 
cremation authorization—we do a lot of cremations here — so, "I know it's hard for you 
to sign the cremation authorization. You know, that's— Do you want me to go over that 
with you, or do you want me to just summarize each paragraph? I can give you a copy." 
So I think they appreciate me stepping into those things easy. And I know that it's hard 
to see the casket room. So when we go see the casket room, "This is kind of— When 
you're ready—" It's hard to see caskets when you know that your son or your mother 
or your father is going to be in there. So I think they appreciate that. And then I think a 
lot— and then I'll show them around, and it always seems to me there's a time— Sadly, 
funeral directors have a bad rep, a lot of them. You know, because of all the—Jessica 
Mitford book1, and a lot of the — which is still relevant, that it being just a business, that 
we're here to make money. And I think a lot of people come in already challenging you 
on things. Then I almost can feel every point when they realize that that's not why I'm 
here, what we here at Renaissance do. You know, we're—nobody has a lot of money— 
well, some people maybe want to spend a lot of money on a funeral (laughs), but I'm 
like, "You know what, you can get this, but this one has this feature, and it's not as 
much as that, and it comes from a different company. So let's not do that." And, "I'll 
print you some obituaries. We don't charge to print that, I just want you to have those." 
Like, once they know that you're not trying to get them — (laughs) sadly thanks to past 
funeral directors — or that you really are there, there's an actually, you feel it, in the 
conference, when you actually gain their trust. And then once you gain their trust, then 
it's two ways the whole way. That happened today. I met with a family this morning 
and I actually felt that turn. She was kind of snippy in some of her responses to me— 
"Well, that's not what we want to talk about right now" — and then it turned. And then I 
think, once you've gained that trust, then anything that you do, they're so grateful for. 
And I don't know how many times people say, "You know what, this turned out great. 
It's a funeral, but everything went the way it was supposed to go, and thank you for 
this suggestion." So I think, for me, that's how it progresses. And I never show anybody 
the facility when they first walk in. They're not ready to talk about service stuff yet. We 
need to get in, we need to get to know each, how—you know, there's a lot of different 
relationships. There's the mom and the step-mom together, and the sister who doesn't 
talk to the other sister. You know what I mean? You feel that out, respect it, and you 
find what works. So I think once you come back and go over all those things and get 
that feel, then it grows from there. And I like. I've actually had, picked up somebody at 
the hospital, in the hospital room, met with them, went through the service, and took 
them to Arlington myself, and walked with the family behind the casket. So literally 
from death to burial. That's what I love best about what we do here. I'm not sure how it 
is at other funeral homes. I think whoever's working does the service. I want to be with 
them from the second they arrive, whether they pick up the body or not, to the very 
end. And they like to see that same—they trust me, and they look to me, and they know 
that I've been that stable for them the whole time. And I think that's what gains trust, 
too. And sharing, when I do share with them, then people do, they realize they're 
talking to somebody that's been through it. And I don't throw it out with everybody, 
but there's times that I know it will be helpful to them to know that I've been through it 
too. So I think that's kind of how it works for me. I don't know how it works for 
everybody else. 
1 The American Waij of Death, first published in 1963. 
[0:40:00] SB: I'm glad you brought up the Jessica Mitford book. I already knew 
several funeral directors before I read that, so you know, I had the perspective that, you 
know—this is not the whole picture, it's if anything a very small part of the picture. I 
knew that all the funeral directors I'd met were very compassionate people who 
worked in it for — 
HH: For the right reasons. 
SB: —yeah, who were in it for the right reasons. Exactly. But how has that affected 
the field, and public perceptions of the field? 
HH: That's a good question. I feel like I'm in such a small population, where we are, 
and that our funeral home doesn't operate like that. And I'm only going to bring this up 
because I think it's relevant. I just had a gentleman email me yesterday, and he was 
getting cremation rates. And our cremation rates are in the low, in the mid-twos. And 
he said, "Well, I found some for $980 in Richmond. What's the difference?" I'm like 
"Fair question." I said, "Well, there are some that are lower-price ones, and there is a 
need for that. There are some families that are not going to have a service, and that's all 
they can afford. And nobody's going to judge that." And then so I answered him that 
there are $950 providers, and there's $4,000 providers, that you're going to buy a 
package. Mostly corporate-owned funeral homes. And I'm biased that you're going to 
buy a package and you're going to get a hundred thank-you notes that you don't need, 
and you're going to get this engraved necklace that— I don't know what they provide, 
because I don't work there. But I said, "We provide a level of service a step up from 
there." I know a gentleman that does it here, works out of his car. Doesn't always wear 
a nice suit when he comes to pick up your mother. You know? And I wouldn't want 
that level of care. So I said, "We're a step up from that care. And we file the death 
certificate, which means going to the doctor's office, sometimes going back twice, and 
then taking it downtown. And then we notify Social Security, we help you place an 
obituary, we will help you with estate settlement." So I gave him all the services we 
provide, and then I said, "Actually, the cremation is the cremation. We're probably all 
using the same one. But it's a level of service that we provide." And so — and I'm going 
somewhere with it — and I said, "Is that the level of care that you want?" And the 900, 
you're going to get that car with somebody that's not very professional, you don't know 
how they're handling the body. So he wrote back, and I thought — I almost did it with 
my fur up, "Well, think about—you get what you pay for," to a point. You know what I 
mean. He wrote back, and he was like, "Thankful for your thoughtful email," 
discussing why, and, "I will be calling you when my dad passes." I didn't expect to get 
that. I was like, "Okay, I spent twenty minutes thinking out that email, and it came 
back." Because there is — I remember before I got into the funeral service a 20-20 
episode about people up-selling, and all these things that seal up that you don't need to 
seal up. And I had my back up when my mom was planning for my grandmother. I was 
like, "Don't let them sell you this, don't let them sell you that." And I think that's a hard 
rap to beat. And I think slowly people—and I remember that, and I'm mid-forties, and I 
think a lot of people that are planning for funerals are my age or usually older. And I 
think that there are still people out there like that. I belong to a Facebook group that's 
all about business. And somebody said, "Would you charge somebody to come in and 
fill a necklace with cremains?" "Oh, yeah, absolutely. We're putting our time in." And 
then most of the people said "Absolutely not." But it's because there are still people like 
that out there that it's about— And I think the corporate funeral homes don't help at all 
by charging the prices that they do charge, I think, and including it in a package of 
things they don't need. We do charge what we charge, but we have to pay the bills. We 
have staff. Nobody's driving expensive Lamborghinis in the back, you'll see that. So I 
think it's fair, and I'm happy that I work somewhere that I feel is fair. And you do get 
great service. And it'll be beautiful, and we have a beautiful chapel and a beautiful 
facility. And that's something that you pay for as well. And we also offer our families 
the use of our facility for no charge when we do a cremation, because we feel it's so 
important to have that rite of passage. You know, and I like to talk people into doing 
that. But in general, how that book— Hopefully we're on our way back up. But I think 
while we're still — I don't know, people aren't really educated. I think the average 
estimate is that 2.5 people will plan a funeral in their lifetime. They'll plan 2.5 funerals 
in their lifetime! 
[0:45:00] Which is, you know, normal people that aren't interested in this don't go 
around investigating this type of stuff until you need it. You know? So it's not like — I 
mean, you're talking about funerals, so you're interested in it. There's not many people 
that do that. So I think until, as public knowledge, as that you have more choices, you 
don't have to do the standard funeral that we all grew up with. I actually had someone 
come in and said, "I thought by law you had to embalm." And I said, "Absolutely not. 
You don't have to do embalming." So hopefully that shift is changing. And I'm trying to 
do my part in that by having these Death Cafes. And you don't know what ripple effect 
that might have, if somebody else actually saying to somebody, "Well, I was at a Death 
Cafe, and Heather said you don't have to embalm," or "Heather said you don't have to 
do this." And hopefully my little ripple will cause something in the general vicinity. 
(Laughs) I like to think so anyway. (Laughs) We'll see. 
SB: Thinking about planning funerals, what is it like to work with a person who's 
coming in with pre-arrangements? Both, you know, just— 
HH: Like if they've prearranged with us and have everything done? Or if they bring 
in their own paperwork and say, "This is what we want." It's the same thing. 
SB: Oh, I mean if — I may not know the right term for it—but when a person comes in 
and wants to pre-arrange for their own funeral arrangement. 
HH: Mm-hmm. We do that a lot. Usually it's because they had a death recently in 
their family that wasn't planned, and, or they went through somebody that did have it 
planned, or they've been to, close friends with somebody. Recently I had a family who, 
nothing was planned, not even the gravesite or the burial place, not even a cemetery. 
And I remember all of her friends around her, she had a lot of support, they're like, 
side-whispering to me, "You know what. Heather? This is like — realizing we all need to 
go do this." I don't think until you, unless you're really anti— You know the people, 
they're like, "Absolutely not, don't bring it up, I don't want to talk about it." But it's not 
for you, it's for your survivors. And I find a very — and I'm for it. I'm all for pre¬ 
planning. Even if you don't pre-pay, give me a booklet of exactly what you want. You 
want a cremation? You want to do a church service at the church? And you want your 
remains to go here, and you know what song you like? Just so somebody knows what 
your wishes are. Although then again, we run into people who say, "Dad wanted 
nothing. He just" — my dad's like this, he says, "Throw me in a pine box out in the 
woods" is what he says. Which I like to do, because I like green burial. But they're like, 
"Well, Dad said he didn't want anything, and we want to honor his wishes." And I've 
turned a couple people. I'm like, "Well, your dad loves you, and we don't charge — " So 
it's not like I'm trying to talk them into something we charge for. You can use our 
facility for free, but— but with a lot of the direct cremations that we're doing now, 
people just want to do direct cremation and wash their hands and be done. Whereas 
there's a community rite, r-i-t-e, a community rite for people to gather and remember 
that person and give their condolences to the family. And I think it's an important part 
of the grieving process that people have that service. So I've talked several people into 
saying, "He wanted that because he didn't want you to have extra costs, or maybe he 
didn't like going to funerals, but this is for you. This is not about him right now. This is 
about you and your mom, who are left, and you guys can be lifted." Because the 
community that surrounds somebody lifts them up so much. When it happened to me, 
there was so much love and support around me. I found it hard to cry a lot because 
there was so much love, and people were doing so much. You know when I'd cry, when 
somebody would do something nice for me. Like "She bought me this dinner and I'm 
so happy." So it's so important to have something. Don't have it here. If your dad liked 
to drink, go down to the bar and have a shot in his name. You know, or go to the 
bowling alley. And you know, do something. Whether that's, if that's pre-planned and 
he tells everybody, then good. And the prepayment makes it so much easier on the 
family too. Although cremations aren't that expensive. You could dole out $3,000, 
$3,500 for a cremation, as opposed to nine to $10,000 for a funeral. Not that everybody 
has that. You know what I mean? It's a little easier. I've done a lot of pre-payment 
lately, and pre-planning, and it's for your loved ones. And I'm a big proponent of pre¬ 
arranging. Literally you pick a day and time. Everything's already done. And people 
say, "This is so easy. I'm so glad she did this, and we don't have to make any 
decisions." When you pre-pay you can also pre-sign your cremation authorization, 
which means you don't have to have all the family get signatures before you can even 
do the cremation. You can sign your own. And everything is done. It's so easy. I really 
think it's a great idea. And I've read places where they say it's a scam, where you can 
use your life insurance money. But God forbid you go into long-term care. 
[0:50:00] Then that money that you're putting for a pre-arrangement is protected, 
it's a protected asset. So when people hear that, they're like, "Okay, no matter where 
you go, your initial investment is always there. We don't keep the money. We invest it 
with third party." So I'm all for it, and the families like it when people do it. Happy 
families, happy me. (Laugh) That helps. 
SB: My father did that. He had arranged and paid for everything, and we didn't 
know about it. And thank goodness he did, because when he died it was such a shock, 
we couldn't have, you know—there was various messy legalities, we didn't have the 
cash on hand to take care of it if he hadn't done it. So you know, it was a good thing. 
HH: It's a gift. It really is. 
SB: Yeah. Absolutely. Now, this is a fairly—the Raleigh area anyway, this is a fairly 
ethnically and religiously diverse area. Is that the case of the clientele here? 
HH: Yes. That's what I love about this. Like I said, we're family-owned, and Joe is 
younger than me, and his dad, Joe, has a funeral home in New Hyde Park. And from 
what I hear, they're all Italian or Polish Catholic. It's the same service they do every 
day, different person. I love that we don't do that. It would be a little easier, because 
you'd have everything already set up. I had a Jewish funeral yesterday. We've done 
non-denominational funerals. I've got a Christian funeral coming up. The family that 
owns this is Catholic, so we do a lot of — I'm an honorary Catholic, by the way. I'm of no 
religion, but I'm an honorary Catholic, and I love the music. But I love the idea. We've 
done Indian Hindu funerals, and creative things, and I love the diversity in this area, 
and I love the different traditions. It was my first Jewish funeral yesterday, so that was 
really interesting to be a part of that. It was so hot though! (Laughs) Outside at the 
cemetery. But I love that part of it. You brought that up, and it's so true. You never 
know what we'll have. It's really neat. 
SB: Is there a lot of sort of quick learning about traditions, or do you come into this 
with a — 
HH: Well, the hardest ones to learn are the Catholic— They have their special rules. 
And Hindus have their rules. You know, the burial has to take place in this amount of 
time, and there's anointing to be done. And the same with the Jewish folks. They need 
to have this done at this time, and this is the kind of casket. The chevra kadisha will 
come and wash the body. I've not done a Muslim funeral yet. But I have a friend who's 
Muslim, and he might plan with me. (Laughs) But um, I think, those ones, yes. We do 
know those strict rules. And we have Jewish folder up there and we read, "Okay, this is 
what we need." Because we don't do them every day. But the other ones are usually 
no n-deno mi national, and then it's the sky's the limit. You can do what you want. And a 
lot of our green burials end up like that, where they'll do — somebody had a sprite and a 
juice mix, and it was called the Elixir of Life. And they passed around cups to us and we 
drank it, and then we sprinkled some on the grave. And then they lit candles and we 
sang. I love the freedom of that, but I also respect the Catholic way, because you know 
what to— Mass is what comforts people, because you know what's going to happen. 
They know that they're going to get their Eucharist, and so there's something calming 
about having that. I love it all. I never know what's going to walk in the door. 
SB: So anthropology is another field that's — 
HH: Yeah, it really is. And also we have these different sects. Those people that did 
the Jewish funeral, they weren't strict followers. So there's a little bit of leeway there. 
You know, and then you have some Catholic folks. Most devout Catholics don't 
cremate, but we do a lot of Catholic cremations, because it's okay now. The Pope has 
approved it. So while we get those religions, we get variations of those religions too, 
where I think in that funeral home like in New York, you do this, this is the morning-of, 
there's no variation. So we have variations even on our strict religions. (Laughs) Very 
lenient down here in the South. 
SB: What is the approximate break-out of, you know, the work that you do here 
between embalming, non-embalming, earth burial, green burial, cremation? 
HH: I think I just looked at these numbers the other day, and don't hold me to this. 
[0:55:00] I think we're about, this year, and I think we're a little lower this year, we're 
only halfway through, we're 75 to 80% cremation. And of our burials. I'd say a little 
more than half of those—say 20% of our burials. I'd say 10% are embalmings, or 15, and 
then I think the other 5% is green burial. Which is kind of my thing. I really like green 
burial. As you know it differs from year to year. But our cremation rate is very high. 
Especially in Raleigh. You go outside of Raleigh—which, you've probably talked to 
some folks outside of Raleigh—and that may flip. It's really different. There's so 
many—with the Triangle here, with Research Triangle Park, we have a lot of people 
that aren't from here. So I think that makes it higher. And I did some research—let's 
see—I think a lot folks that are more educated folks, I think, do cremation and green 
burial than traditional burial. I read a number there, don't quote me on that though. 
That's where we are in it. Which is neat too. Even though we do direct cremations, most 
of them have services. So we're still doing, servicing the family, not just doing a direct 
cremation. 
SB: What are the options for green burial? What's currently available? 
HH: Green burial is the quick—no embalming, no vault. And there's two cemeteries 
in Raleigh that do green burial. Oakwood Cemetery, downtown, has a section called 
Mordecai Meadows, where they do green burial; and then Pine Forest in Wake Forest. 
They have a beautiful cemetery, and then a pond, and then behind the pond is just 
woods — and you're literally in the woods. Folks can choose from a cardboard container, 
a pine box that is made locally here in North Carolina, or a shroud. So they choose 
which cemetery, then they choose which casket or shroud, and then we don't usually— 
with those we don't usually do viewings, because the body's not embalmed. Although 
it could be viewed without being embalmed. But usually it's, you want to do a viewing 
right away. So usually just the family, if they need to have their closure and see the 
body that's done right away. Then the folks will either do a service here or will do a 
graveside service. And whether or not they're— A lot of times at Oakwood what we've 
done so far is they have a lowering device that will lower the body down. At Pine 
Forest we have ropes. We actually, the family will lower down and sometimes even 
cover up the grave themselves. And I love the green burials. I think it's beautiful. We 
did a green burial on someone's property, and I just remember the grandkids covering 
up the grave, and saying, "Bye, Grandpa." And I thought, how healthy is that. Where 
we get phone calls all the time, "Is there going to be a body present? I don't want to 
bring my children if there's going to be a body." So I love the idea that it's more hands- 
on, it's more interactive, and it's —I think—it's healthier. That's my opinion. I'm not 
sticking behind. (Laughs) We all grieve better when we're more hands-on, I think. 
SB: I think so too. Do you encounter much by way of people's supernatural beliefs in 
your work? 
HH: People— I'll hear people talking about some strange occurrences that have 
happened around the home. And I love hearing that. I wish that I would have— 
hopefully your next question is have I ever noticed anything here —maybe it wasn't— 
but no, I haven't. I really wish I would, because I personally don't know what's on the 
other side. And I figured if I saw something here that would change my mind, then I 
would feel better. But I never have noticed anything odd here. And I love to hear what 
people say. Most of it is at the time of death. Like, "She was waiting until somebody 
came," or "The second we stepped out, this happened," or "Right afterwards, my 
phone died," or— You know, I love hearing—nothing, no major stories, "I was visited 
and she said 'Go to Renaissance.'" (Laughs) I wish they would. But I like, I hear a lot of 
the same ones. I remember, I was taking an urn to the church one time, and I was 
driving my own car, and I sat the urn down beside me in my seat, and a ladybug came 
and landed on the lid. I said, "Well, hello. You're coming with me." And then I got 
there and I told the family. I thought it might be nice. And they're like (gasps), "You're 
kidding! That was her favorite. That was her visiting." So I love that story. And I'm 
open to it, and I love hearing about it. I just wish I would experience it. 
[1:00:00] Maybe someday. I guess you have to be open to it. But I don't know. I 
wish I knew. 
SB: And is that something that the folks at the Death Cafe have talked about some 
too? 
HH: Mm-hmm. Yeah. Not so much. Hopefully I'll bring that up a little bit next time. I 
can't exactly right now remember, but I have had, remember some topics coming up. I 
think at our very first one —and she's never came back—her husband was actually an 
investigator, paranormal investigator, and she had said they never found much. But I 
think that also comes into having faith. You know. There are redbirds around, and if 
you see a redbird land in your yard and you think that's a sign from your husband, 
then please, it is a sign. That's your faith. I love that, and I love hearing those stories, 
and I hope it is. I hope that we figure out the greatest— That's what my husband told 
me when I started working here. I'm like, "What happens, and why do people think 
this?" And he's like, "Whatever happens when we die is the greatest mystery, and 
we're not supposed to know until it happens." Well, maybe someday we'll all know. 
Maybe we'll all be back together again someday. If I only had proof. A notarized 
statement would be nice. (Laughs) I wish. 
SB: What do you see in the coming years for your work? 
HH: Personally, or as funeral work? I would love to have my own funeral home, with 
a crematory, and do green burial, and actually have my own green cemetery. That's 
what I would love to do. And then have a therapy dog there, so that people can grieve. 
That would be my dream. And before I, before my husband died, he was like searching 
for crematories, and open up your own thing—because everybody asks you that, "Do 
you want to open your own?" After he passed I was like, dream is gone, because I have 
to support my family. I can't dream like that. But there are some people that are doing 
that and doing a good job at it. Our green burial rate is so low right now I'm not sure it 
would sustain something. That's why I would want to have a crematory as well. But if I 
had, if you handed me like six million dollars right now — I don't know why I said six— 
that's what I would do. I would buy a big plot of land, open a green cemetery, my own 
funeral home, and get a therapy dog. Don't even need to think about that. 
SB: I love the idea of having a therapy dog. 
HH: Mm-hmm. And they're out there, and they're happening. And I'm trying to get 
one here. I have two at home, but they would not do well. My labradoodle is afraid of 
people, and my little one, a Maltese-Yorkie mix, he would just lick you the whole time. 
But I'd love to get— Because people love animals, and that would make the experience 
even that much better, I think. But I'm not good at training dogs, so I'd have to have 
help with that. 
SB: (Laughs) Well, there are so many topics we've covered, but so many more we 
could. What have we not touched on that you would like to be sure and include in this 
recording? 
HH: Um, I think I would touch just more on the move to green burial and why. 
SB: Yeah. Yeah. 
HH: I think we get stuck in customs. You know. Even growing up, my grandparents 
passed when I was in my twenties and early thirties, and you did embalming, and you 
did a casket that sealed, and a vault that sealed. It's just what you did. And then my 
other grandfather passed away right after I started here, and he was cremated. And it 
was the first cremation in our whole family. I like seeing that move to different things. I 
don't personally like the idea of somebody in a casket, in a sealed box under the ground 
like that. I've seen a disinterment lately, and after seeing that. I'm even more convinced. 
I think our bodies are organic materials and we need to return to the earth. Whether 
that's through cremation or through green burial, personally, that's what I think. I don't 
understand why we ever went to that in the first place. Nobody— I don't know if 
people think— And I don't talk people out of it, but I wonder what people think your 
body is going to be protected forever? And the process that happens to a body when it 
decomposes, and it's not, have air and water, is not—people don't know what happens. 
It's a secret. Like, google what happens to a body in a sealed —I'm trying not to —the 
public may be listening to this — but do your research on what, how bodies decompose. 
That's not how you want to decompose. 
[1:05:00] That's why I think cremation is so popular. But there's such a slow move 
from what we think a traditional funeral should be. And the more I've done this, the 
more convinced that I am that I want to just return, I want to return my body to the 
earth. There's a Fox Chase, Fox-something Reserve in Ohio. I forget the name. It's in 
Wilmot. It's a conservation ground. So by planting yourself there (laughs) you're not 
only returning to the earth and helping things grow, you're also conserving that land. 
Nothing else will be— They won't pave Paradise and put up a parking lot. You know? 
So I love that idea. What's hard to see is people come in and say, "She was a gardener, 
she loved this, and she bought organic food." But then you're going to buy expensive 
chemicals and a casket and just—you know, and I don't like the fact that funeral 
directors aren't educating people about the different choices, and that they're going to 
make more money by doing that. On this Facebook site that I'm a member of, just to, I 
don't know, turn a side-eye, "Well, we can't do cremation because that's killing our 
business." Well, you've got to adapt. And I think, I don't think green burial will ever be 
the choice, but I think it will be alongside cremation. I don't like the— And I hope that 
that trend continues, and I hope that we can educate people on the other choices that 
they have. But it's really hard to educated people. As I'm sitting here with you. I'm 
wondering, maybe you just buried somebody and you chose a vault and a casket, now 
you're wondering, "Ew, what choice did I make?" Like, mausoleums, why— putting 
somebody in a — So we're educated about everything else, but we don't research what 
happens to our bodies. If you're very concerned about the body that you're going to 
spend $4,000 on a casket, and $1,400 on a vault, but not research why or why not you 
want— 
SB: What in ten years from now the body's going to be like. 
HH: Yeah. In less than a year you could decompose naturally, or in thirty to forty, 
fifty years. And I don't know why people — I don't understand, besides tradition and 
culture, why that would be. But. I don't know. 
SB: When you talk to people about green burial, do you find that they already know 
about it, or are they surprised? 
HH: Hmm. That's what we come up against. It's not— They may have heard the 
word, but they don't understand what it means, or that it's legal, or that you can do it 
here. When I walk away from a green burial people will say, "I didn't know you could 
do that," or, "Can I do this in my yard?" That people know that they can do some stuff 
at home. First thing you think of, "A funeral at my house? I don't want a body—" Then 
we have to say, why do we have that death-negativity? That's what we did beforehand. 
It's kind of like, death and birth, before it was professionalized and medicalized, it was 
done at home. So I would love to be able to help people do home funerals, and then 
assist them with burial. They may have heard about it and they don't know about it, 
and they may be leaning that way, but they're afraid what their friends might think. 
They're afraid that it's not, you know, respectful enough. And that's kind of tough. The 
family before last, there was the wife and two, I think it was her nieces. And the nieces 
like hounded me with questions. "Ooh, where can you do this? This is allowed? We 
love this idea." And the wife said, "No, this is tradition. This is how—" And never, ever 
would I question or judge. I mean, I have my opinions, but I can 100% respect what 
somebody does. And she thought about it and thought about it, and I thought, "Oh, I'm 
going to sway it." But then we ended up doing a sealed vault and an embalming, and 
that's what comforted her. And that's fine. But for me or my loved one, that's not what I 
would choose. But they were intrigued. So it's a little— Although I did do a green burial 
last month of a 90-year-old. She chose her green burial. But I think it's going to take a 
long time, but we're dropping these little clues everywhere. And hopefully somebody 
will remember, "Oh, no, you can do this. "And hopefully more cemeteries will offer it. 
You know, when I get my six million and I open up my cemetery in North Raleigh, then 
everybody will know about it. (Comical laugh) I wish! I'll play the lottery. 
SB: I do too. 
HH: "Got to play to win." 
SB: I think you mentioned this earlier, but do you think this is — some people who 
creation would have chosen green burial if they'd known about it? Is cremation like the, 
sort of, understood alternative to — 
[1:10:00] HH: I think so. I think it is socially acceptable, more socially acceptable 
sometimes than green burial. And I don't know. I think cost does play a factor, because 
direct green burial is more than cremation. So if it comes down to cost, I think that's 
important. And I think the people that are choosing cremation, it's because that's what 
the deceased wanted. Maybe the deceased didn't know there was a green burial. So I 
think those factors play into why they do it. Most of the people that I sway into green 
burial—not sway or discuss or bring up —is not usually cremation to green burial, it's 
traditional burial to burial. So it's almost like there are two different things in people's 
minds, and they don't usually go from cremation to green. They usually go traditional 
to green. That's what I've found. 
SB: That's fascinating. I would have guessed it was the other way. That's interesting. 
Now, I was just reading recently about the—and I can't remember the term for it— but 
the water— 
HH: Aquamation, or alkaline hydrolysis. I'll come up with it. It's water cremation. A 
lot of people are doing it with pets now. It's only legal in a few states, and had you not 
asked me I probably would have been able to rattle it off. I don't know. Because 
people—the way— there's water that comes out when it's done, and people are 
concerned that that's organic body material that's coming out. And the real intricate 
study that I read on it was that where that is going has to be filtered into the public 
waste area, and that that's the reason it's not allowed, is that what is draining is coming 
out. But it produces the same results as cremation. It's just breaking down the body 
chemically as opposed to with flame. I've not heard much buzz around it here at all. I 
think anything in the funeral industry, from what I've heard, takes really slow. It's 
getting, you'll see press about it, splashed around, but I don't think you'll see it 
mainstream. And I think the units are pretty expensive too. So I doubt that you'll find a 
funeral home that offers both. Because they're both pretty expensive. But we'll see. 
Time will tell. 
SB: I was curious reading about it, thinking not — I wasn't fully understanding why 
this is a, you know, what this offers that cremation doesn't. 
HH: The flame. I guess. They call it flameless cremation. So. And it's a little less, pulls 
a little less energy than, I think, cremation does. Someone said it's like driving from 
here to Wisconsin in a Prius, is how much fuel—I mean, you still use up a lot of fuel. I 
mean, cremation is not — depending on who you ask—cremation providers will say. 
"It's very green." And green burial outfits will say, "Well, no, it's not. You're still 
putting mercury into the air, and you're still using fuel to fuel the—" But it's less 
invasive on the earth than traditional burial. Depending on who you ask, you'll get 
different answers. But I don't know that it would ever be mainstreamed, for a while. 
Unless the cost comes down on it too. Because you know, funeral homes are businesses, 
and you have to be able to afford to buy one. So. I think it's a lot more relevant with 
pets right now. I don't know. We'll see. I'll be watching too. Really. 
SB: Well, this has been fantastic. Is there anything you'd like to add before? 
HH: I can't think of anything. I've kind of — gave you many of my thoughts, and think 
I've covered most of it. And I'm glad you're doing this, you know, for people to listen to 
and educate them on. If this reaches just one person, who will take some information 
about Death Cafe or have a better— (Laughs) That's kind of an inside joke. You see 
people on talk shows, "If I could help one person with my crazy thing that I do." Maybe 
somebody will hear this and look into green burial, or realize that funeral directors 
aren't all bad. Or out to make a buck. Pay the bills, that's what we want to do. And 
make a living, and be able to send my kids to karate class. You know? So they can beat 
me up. (Laughs) But no. And I think when people are choosing, I like the idea of 
working for a locally-owned funeral home. I think that's supportive. 
SB: Thank you so much. This has been great. 
HH: You're welcome. Thank you. Appreciate it.
