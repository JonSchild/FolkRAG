BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH. 
JENNIE MORGAN , 
whose Vocal triumphs throughout 
the principal Cities of the Union, have received the highest 
encomiums of the press, is now the reigning Metropolitan 
favorite. 
Her first appearance before the public was in First Class 
Concerts, as a 
Balladist, where, by the correctness of her 
• 
singing, and the sweetness of her voice, she attracted uni-
versal attention. 
• 
An offer of an almost unprecedented remuneration, in-
duced her to enter upon the Variety Stage ; to which, her 
presence has lent refining influence. 
Her modest appear-
ance exacts the warmest sympathy among her auditors, 
while her naive rendition of the ballads she sings charms 
the entire audience. 
Her greatest hit has been in the Kiss SONG, which she 
sang in Chicago for twenty consecutive weeks. 
In 
Boston 
she created a 
furore, and in New York her admirers are 
legi on.

KISS, KISS. 
As sung with the greatest success, by JENNIE M ORGAN. 
Music to be had of G. D. ntSSELL S
.: CO., Boston, Mass., Price 50cts. 
Who hath not felt when sad and lone 
The magnetic pressure of a 
hand? 
The music of a 
friendly tone. 
We all the charm well understand! 
But there's a 
rapture deeper, dearer, 
Love's symbol and its seal of bliss, 
When hearts and lips come nearer, nearer, 
And language melts into a 
kiss! 
CHORUS. 
Ala! Leaves on the tree, 
Flow'r and the bee 1 
To the waters glowing, winds are kisses blowing! 
Matron and maid, 
None are afraid, 
Sign of all our earthly bliss is this, a 
kiss! 
Tho' many a 
false kiss bath been given I 
Tho' many a 
lip hath feign'd its love! 
A 
kiss came none the less from heaven. 
It must be right, ' tis done above! 
Affection hath no image purer. 
Then if a 
maid be over coy, 
Let this reflection reassure her, 
That angels quite approve the joy ? 
Ah! Leaves, itc.

" 
Good Bye, Sweetheart, Good Bye." 
As sung by JENNIE MORGAN. 
Music to be had of Wm. A. 
POND & CO., 547 Broadway. Price 40cts. 
The bright stars fade, the morn is breaking, 
The dew-drops pearl each bud and leaf, 
And I 
from thee my leave am taking, 
With bliss too brief, with bliss, with bliss too brief. 
How sinks my heart with fond alarms, 
The tear is hiding in mine eye, 
For time doth thrust me from thine arms; 
Good bye, sweetheart, good bye ! 
Good bye, sweetheart, good bye! 
For time doth thrust me from thine arms. 
Good bye, sweetheart, good bye! 
For time doth thrust me from thine arms. 
Good bye, sweetheart, good bye! 
The sun is up, the lark is soaring, 
Loud swells the song of chanticleer, 
The levret bounds o'er earth's soft flooring, 
Yet I 
am here, yet I 
am here ; 
For since night's gems from heav'n did fade, 
And morn to floral lips doth he, 
I 
could not leave thee, tho' I 
said, 
Good bye, sweetheart, good bye! 
Good by, sweetheart, good bye! 
I 
could not leave thee, tho' I 
said, 
Good bye, sweetheart, good bye!

High in my window two love-birds 
Hung in their cage for a 
summer long; 
Their passion had not the relief of words, 
And they did not appear to know a 
song; 
But there they nestled upon the perch, 
Beak to beak in a 
loveable way, 
Like two young lovers just fresh from church, 
And a 
look in their eyes that seemed to say— 
CHORUS. 
Hours go by 
Let them fly 
We'll mark them with a 
kiss. 
Hours go by 
Let them tly 
The time we pass in kissing, 
The time we pass in kissing 
Is time we never miss. 
My bird's example spread far and wide; 
There in the window they kiss'd and coo'd, 
'Till it soften'd the hearts of folks outside, 
And quite affected the neighborhood; 
And love grew in fashion more and yet more; 
All thro' the terrace flirtation so rag'd, 
That no One of twenty, few of two score, 
But was either just wed or else engaged.

I 
and you 
Take our delight in this. 
Kiss and coo 
I 
and you 
To share a 
perch together, 
To share a 
perch together, 
And kiss and kiss and kiss 
My aged Granny. a 
prim old dame, 
Was wholly perturn1 at their wooing ways: 
What forward things, I 
am 
with shame, 
No birds so acted in my young days, 
Their brazen inr2aothsty pray disown, 
And send the creatures at once to roost; 
You ought to provide them a. chaperone, 
And see them properly introduced. 
Chorus as before. 
At last came some one to see the birds ; 
Somebody came, I 
won't tell who, 
But he begg'd them of me with pleading words; 
Ask'd for them and their mistress too: 
And some bow, I 
and that foolish man, 
Tho' how it happeri'd I 
cannot swear, 
Agreed to follow the Love-bird's plan, 
And make two couples instead of a 
pair. 
Chorus as before.

If you love me as I 
love you, 
No knife can cut our loves in two, 
And so the best thing you can do 
Is just give a 
little kiss. 
To make poor little Cupid blind 
Was very cruel and unkind, 
lie's got his lips so never mind 
So long as be can Kiss. 
CH0:—A kiss for you, S:c. 
3. 
" 
Oh take oh take those lips away" 
I 
hear a 
timid maiden say. 
But bring 'em back another day 
To give another kiss. 
Faint heart fair lady never won, 
So go on as you have begun, 
And if you won t 
tell any One 
I'll let you have a 
kiss. 
Cuo:—A kiss for you, Ice. 
4. 
" 
Oh come with me to fairy dells" 
Well build our house of oyster shells, 
Where no intruder near us dwells, 
To see us give a 
kiss. 
Love in a 
cottage oh how sweet, 
Till poverty comes down the street, 
Then out love flies, his wings are fleet, 
He doesn't stop to kiss. 
Cuo:—A kiss for you, & c. 
5. 
Some folks who would our love annoy, 
Have put poor Cupid ever coy, 
In nickerbockers, naughty boy, 
Because he learnt to kiss. 
I 
hope my song has caused delight, 
And if you kindly think I'm right 
I'll come again another night, 
And throw another kiss. 
Clio:—A 
kiss for you. &c.

Music to be bad of Wm. A. 
POND & Co., 541 Broadway. 
Price 30cts. 
Here by thy side, love, sadly I 
stand, 
Eager to feel the soft touch of your hand, 
Waiting to hear again thy sweet voice; 
Tender words breathing to make me rejoice; 
How have I 
suffered and wished I 
were dead, 
For those sad words that in anger I 
said; 
Oh, whisper you cherish for all, no regret, 
Say you forgive me, then kiss and forget, 
CHORUS. 
Kiss and forget, love, each angry word; 
Speak but to tell me my pleading is heard; 
Kiss and forget love, each angry word; 
Speak but to tell me my pleading is heard: 
Why should your heart be repining yet ? 
Say you forgive me, then kiss and forget. 
Why should your heart be repining yet? 
Say you forgive me, then kiss and forget. 
Smile on me, dearest, same as of old, 
Rest on my bosom thy tresses of gold; 
Tell me in accents tender and true, 
All that my loving lips once did repeat. 
I 
have been wayward and unkind to you, 
Yet in my heart I 
have ever been true. 
Think of the past with no mournful regret, 
Say you forgive me, then kiss and forget. 
Kiss and forget, &c. 
Why did we ever wander apart, 
Filling with sorrow each happy young 
Love's rosy pathway should know of no tewA,g, 
Never a 
shadow of sorrowful fears. 
Life should be joyous to you and to me, 
Fair as the sunlight that kisses the sea. 
Let us go back to the day that we met, 
Banishing all as we kiss and forget. 
Ki 
and forget,

Upon a 
rustic bridge we met 
One afternoon in Spring; 
His loving words I 
can't forget, 
Within my ears they ring ! 
The swans were sailing on the Lake, 
And all the Park was gay; 
My hand in his he chanced to take 
In such a 
charming way! 
The flowers were bright, but oh, his eyes 
They shone like stars of night! 
His smile was like the glowing skies, 
And filled me with delight. 
I 
seem'd in love's delicious dream, 
My heart with rapture beat; 
And while his eyes did on me beam, 
I 
heard his lips repeat : 
CHonus. 
There is no harm in kissing. 
Pray tell me, is there, dear? 
Those rosy lips invite me now, 
And no one lingers near! 
Then loving ones are meeting, 
No prying eyes to mark, 
There is no harm in kissing, (a 
kiss) 
At twilight in the Park! 
We strolled along wuere roses grew, 
And all was bright and fair; 
He promised ever to be true, 
And begged my love to share. 
The little birds were flying home4 
They heard my lips reply; 
And stars were bright in yonder dome 
Before we say good bye. 
But, oh, he seemed so sad to leave— 
My heart grew sad as well, 
Yor love within each heart did weave 
Its dear bewitching spell ! 
We lingered, though the hour was late, 
How quick the time had sped! 
But when our lips met at the gate. - 
He softly to me said : 
There is no harm, &c.

PETEERB, 599 Bowery, N. Y. Trice 30ets. 
I 
am a 
gay dashing belle, 
As you are all aware, 
I 
love to dress and cut a 
swell, 
With me none can compare; 
I'm always cheerful, light and gay, 
My heart is never sad, 
I 
strive to cast dull care away, 
To keep my spirits glad. 
REFRAIN. 
Oh! yes, I 
am a 
gay young belle, 
And well I 
love to cut a 
swell, 
Among the boys and girls as well, 
I 
m call'd a 
female swell. 
As I 
walk down the crowded street, 
I 
toss my flowing curls, 
And smile on ev.ry gent I 
meet, 
I'm envied by the girls ; 
The little dears, they are so shy, 
Their thot's they dare not tell, 
They are afraid to wink so sly, 
Like me, the female swell. 
Oh ! yes, I 
am, &c. 
The other day I 
caught a 
beau, 
He offeed me his arm, 
He talk' cl so sweet, we walk'd so slow, 
He worship'd ev'ry charm ; 
He spoke his heartfelt love to me, 
In words I 
cannot tell. 
"Pray stop." said I. " for don't you see, 
That I'm a 
female swell." 
Oh ! yes, I 
am, &c. 
The Day When You'll Forget Me. 
Words by " MonoAN ."

As sung by JENNIE Monam 
Mimic to be had of °LIVED. DITSON & CO, Boston, Mass., Price lOcts. 
You call me sweet and tender names, 
And softly smooth my tresses, 
And all the while my happy heart 
Beats time to your caresses. 
You love me in your tender way, 
I 
answer as you let me; 
But ah! there comes another day, 
The day when you'll forget me, 
The day when you'll forget me. 
I 
know that ey'ry fleeting hour 
Is marked by thoughts I 
bring you, 
I 
know there dwells a 
subtle pow'r 
In the sweet songs I 
sing you. 
I 
do not fear the darkest way, 
With those dear arms about me, 
Ah I 
no, I 
only dread the day 
When you can live without me, 
When you can live without me. 
And still you call me tender names, 
And softly smooth my tresses ; 
And still my happy answ'ring heart 
Beats time to your caresses. 
Hush ! let me put that touch away, 
And clasp your hands above me; 
So while I 
ask to die that day, 
The day you will not love me. 
The day you will not love me. 
You need not check the thoughts that rise 
With darkness wrapt about them, 
For gazing in your earnest eyes, 
My heart can almost doubt them. 
Yet hush my whispers as you may, 
Such chidings do not fret me; 
Al I 
no, I 
only fear that day, 
The day when you'll forget me, 
The day when you'll forget me.

The Grassy-clad Hills of Ould Ireland, 
BUNG BY JOHN 1 
  
F ',DING. 
Let every one cherish the land of their birth, 
No matter what creed on face of the earth. 
With conviviality, friendship and mirth, 
And charms their own little sire land. 
For it's all Botheration to spake of a 
nation, 
• 
Or run down its station from bottom to top; 
The same sky is over its wheat and its clover, 
The time it moves o'er its strength to each crop. 
Cuonrs. 
Hurrah for the hills and murmuring rills 
Where the shamrock illumines the mire land, 
Hurrah for a 
home, musha vilan och hone, 
Near the grassy- clad hills of ould Ireland. 
In praise I 
will sing of that swate, little place, 
Its name from my bosom will ne'er be erased, 
Until the cold turf o'er my body is placed, 
'Neath the soil of my dear native Ireland. 
Where there's rale hospitality, friends in reality, 
An abundance of charity always in store, 
Plenty to trate yez with, milk and potatoes, 
And plenty to greet yez with, whiskey galore. 
Hurrah for the hills, &c. 
Those fond recollections of Erin asthore, 
Will ne'er be effaced from ray mind I 
am sure, 
For my heart dwells in transport on that little shore, 
Near the grassy-clad hills of ould IrCland ; 
For near those hills a 
place is where a 
swate little face is, 
Whese presence it graces a 
cane little cot, 
A 
sweet little cratu.re an angel of nature, 
Her features if once seen would ne'er be forgot, 
Hurrah for tho hills, &c.

IDLING THE TIME AWAY, 
Sung by JOHN FIELDECG. 
If you have health, if you have wealth, 
If you intend to enjoy yourself; 
If you want pleasure, if you want sport, 
Just take a 
trip to New,. York; 
Walk through the City, 
There you'll finci. pictures, I 
think of every kind, 
If you feel weary, not up to the mark, 
Then take a 
gentle walk through the Park. 
Cnouns. 
There you can lie beneath the trees, 
Enjoying yourself with the greatest of ease, 
Wink at the girls just as you please, 
Idling the time away. 
You feel so jolly, lighthearted and gay ; 
Perhaps to a 
girl these words you say :— 
I 
mean to enjoy myself to day, 
Whate'er the expenses may be ; 
You treat her to one or two bottles of beer, 
Then you gef spooney—call her your dear,  
Say that you love her, to her you'll be true— 
In fact, anything in this world say you'll do. 
There you can lie, &c. 
19 
'You stay there p,rbaps r.onie hours, 
Watching the bees, the birds, and the flowers, 
Exercising all your power 
To get her to name the day; 
First she'll say yes, then she'll say no, 
Then she'll say Fred, don't bother me so, 
But if it will please you, it will give me delight, 
To give you an answer going home to-night. 
There 'you can lie, & c. 
Beneath the trees no longer you stay, 
But for home you hasten away, 
Back to the City you return again, 
And see the girl home to her door, 
You kiss her, caress her, squeeze her hand tight, 
And after some talk bid her good night,— 
Tell her you have an income for life, 
And then she'll consent to liccorne. your wire. 
Cnoirus. 
And all through lying beneath the treez. 
Enjoying yourself,

THE WEST POINT CADET, 
Words by Jr)ntrEEcGL. 
Music by M. de Dox2,ro. 
As sung by JENNIE ENGEL. 
Music to be had of G. D. RUSSELL & 
Co., Boston, Mass. 
'Tis sweet on the sea side to wander 
With the darling who gain'd your first love, 
Or alone o'er his kind words to ponder, 
As with joy you his constancy prove; 
But if pleasure you would be receiving, 
A 
pleasure you would not forget, 
'Tis the greatest of fun I'm believing, 
To waltz with a 
West Point Cadet. 
You think to yourself what a 
blessing, 
To waltz with a 
West Point Cadet. 
CHORUS. 
As around with a 
feeling entrancing, 
You gaze on your partner with pride; 
You dream of his future, when dancing, 
How to glory he proudly would ride, 
Is fondly your waist he is pressing, 
And a 
glance from his bright eye you get, 
You think to yourse,f, what a 
blessing, 
To waltz with a 
West Point Cadet; 
You think to yourself what a 
blessing, 
To waltz with a 
West Point Cadet. 
You see him in fancy prc-paring 
To march as a 
Warrior so brave, 
For his life in the battle not caring, 
That his country's bright banner may wave 
In glory and triumph above him; 
To rout the brave foe he has met; 
You wake from your dream but to love him, 
That noble young West Point Cadet. 
You wake from your dream but to love him, 
That noble West Point Cadet. 
As around, Jec. 
Some years have passed by since that Morning 
When I 
and that loved one did meet, 
But the memory oft is returning, 
How together our young hearts did beat. 
I 
have oft in the dance trod a 
measure, 
But the night I 
shall never forget, 
It is stored in my heart like a 
treasure, 
That waltz with the West Point Cadet. 
It is stored in my heart like a 
treasure, 
That dance with a 
West Point Cadet. 
As around, ice.

DARLING, I 
am growing old, 
Silver threads among the gold, 
Shine upon my brow to- day; 
Life is fading fast away, 
But, my darling, you will be, will be 
Always young and fair to me— 
Yes, my darling, you will be, 
Always young and fair to me, 
CHORUS , 
Darling. I 
am growing, growing old, 
Silver threads among the gold, 
Shine upon my brow to- day, 
Life is fading fast away— 
When your hair is silver white, 
And your cheeks no longer bright 
With the roses of the May, 
I 
will kiss your lips and say, 
Oh ! my darling, mine alone, alone, 
You have never older grown— 
Yes, my darling, mine alone— 
YOU have never older grown! 
Darling, I 
am growing, etc. 
Love can never xua.-

uw old, 
Locks may lose their brown and gokl; 
Cheeks may fade and hollow grow, 
But the hearts that love will know, 
Never, never, winter's frost and chill; 
Summer warmth is in them still— 
Never winter's frost and chill, 
Summer warmth is in them still. 
Darling, I'm growing, etc 
Love is always young and fair, 
What to us is silver hair, 
Faded cheeks, or steps grown slow, 
To the heart that beats below; 
Since I 
kissed you, mine alone, alone, 
You have never older grown— 
since I 
kissed you, mine alone, 
You have never older grown. 
Darling, I 
am growing, etc.

:, LTTLE DARLL1STG, 
As sung by Charlie 31e:ville. 
Come sit by my side, little darling, 
And lay your brown head on my breast, 
While the angels of twilight around us, 
Are singing the flowers to rest. 
Your hands are as fair as the lilies, 
That blossom in tile shadows of green, 
And their touch has a 
magical power 
My heart from all sadness to wean. 
Come sit by my side, little darling, 
And lay your brown head on my breat, 
While the angels of twilight around us 
Are singing the flowers to rest. 
I 
dream, when your arms are around me, 
That life is an infinite calm, 
Your kiss has the spell of a 
charmer, 
Your kiss that is sweeter than balm, 
Oh! what could be sweeter than dreaming 
This dream that is on us to-night ? 
Let us think of the present, my darling, 
The future is out of our sight. 
Come sit by my side, &c. 
Sing low in the twilight some ballad, 
As sweet as the smile on your face, 
That shall thrill me with melody's sweetness, 
And touch with its words' tender grace. 
And I'll give you a 
kiss when it's ended, 
A 
kiss that the singer shall earn, 
And perhaps, do you hear, little darling ? 
I 
shall ask for a 
kiss in return. 
Come sit by my side, &c. 
IT may not be, it cannot be 
That such rya was made for me; 
But oh! gin it had been my lot, 
A 
palace not a 
highland cot; 
The bonny, simple gem had thrown 
Bright lustre mund a 
jeweled crown; 
For, oh! the sweetest lass to me 
Is Annie, Annie o' the banks o' Dee. 
Cnonus. 
Annie o' the banks o'Dee ;-
Annie o' the banks o'Dee, 
For, oh! the sweetest lass to me 
Is Annie o' the banks o' the Dee-
I 
love her for ii r 
artless truth, 
I 
love her 
the heart o' youth ; 
When a' the golden dreams o' love 
Bring winged Angels from above: 
A 
stolen glance from Annie shares 
My heart away from a' its cares: 
For, oh ! the sweetest lass to me 
Itnnie, Annie o' the banks o'Dee. 
Annie o' the, &c. 
Come back to Erin, Mavourneen, Mavourneen, 
Come back, Aroon, o 
the land of ,hy birth, 
Come with the Shamrock and spring- time, Mavonrneeta. 
And it's Killarney shall ring with our mirth, 
sure, when we lent you to beautiful England, 
Little we thought of the long winter days, 
Little we thought of the hush of the Star Shine 
Over the mountains, the bluffs, and the brays. 
Cnme back to Erin, Mavourneen, Mavourneen, 
Come back again to the land of thy birth, 
Come back to Erin, Mavourneen, Mavourneen, 
And it's Killarney shall ring with our mirth. 
Over the green sea, Mavourneen, Mavourneen, 
Long shone the white sail that bore thee away, 
Riding the white waves that fair summer mornire, 
Just 'Ake a 
Mayflower a- float on the bay. 
Oh. but my heart sank when clouds came between urs 
Like a 
gray cartain the rain falling down, 
gid from my sad eyes the path o'er the ocean, 
Far, far away where my colleen had flown. 
Come back to Erin, Sze. 
Oh! may the angels, 0 
wakin' and sleepin', 
Watch o'er my bird in the land far away 1 
And k's my prayer will consign to their keepin' 
Care o' my jewel, by night and by day. 
When by the fireside I 
watch the bright embers 
Then all my heart flies to England and thee, 
G—aviu' to know it my darlin' remembers, 
Oz if Ler tkouglits may be crossin' to me. 
Come back to Erin, Ltxt. 
THERE'S a 
sweet little spot, away down 1,,7 Gape Mar, 
Sure, it's Ireland herself, to all Irishmen dear; 
Where the white praties blossom like illig,ant flowers, 
And the wild birds aIng sweetly above the round towers; 
And the dear little Shamrock that none can withstand, 
tbo heautlfv1 Emblem al Old Ireland, 
in his hat, good St. Pat./9A used alvraya to wcer; 
The Shnmrock, whenever he went to a 
fair; 
And Nebuchadnezzar, no doubt highly prized 
A 
bit of the bleesom when he vent disg,-mised; 
For, the bosom of beauty itself might expand, 
Wheta bedecked by the Shamrock of Old Ireland. 
When far, far awuy, a 
swixt blossom 
sot; 
I've dreamt of Shillelagt and Shamrocks so grzaza; 
That grow, like two twins, on the bogs and the hills, 
With a 
drop in my ey 3, that with joy my heart filk2; 
And Iv' a 
biassed the dear sod from a 
far distant strand, 
Arvi the beautiful Shamrock of Old Ireland.

ERIN, MY COUNTRY. 
OH! ERIN, my country, though strangers may roam 
Thy hills and thy mountains I 
once called my own 
Thy lakes and thy valleys no longer I.see, 
But warmly as ever my heart beats for thee. 
Oh I "Cushla Machree" my heart beats for thee, 
Erin! Erin! my heart beats for thee. 
Long years have passed o'er us since the last time we rzyl-z-, 
But lived I 
a 
thousand I 
could not forget: 
The warm heart that loved me, 
The bright eyes that shone 
Like stars in the heaven of days that are gone. 
Oh! " Cushla Machree," &c. 
'Pear home of my youth, I 
shall ne'er see thee more, 
But memory treasures the bright days of ycre: 
And my heart's latest wish, the last sigh of my breast 
Shall be for thee, dear home, the :and of Le west.

Good bye, Charlie, Sze. 
It's hard to see such swarms of swells, 
Who stay at home at ease, 
Tho while my darling has to sail 
The wide and stormy seas. 
That _I 
suppose it would not do 
For all to stay at home, 
.knd so I 
can but hope my love 
Ere long will cease to roam.

Bid the hawthorn breathe perfume. 
Spring, A:c,

wander 'mid the roses in the golden summer timc 
And listen to the streamlet while it rings a 
merry chime, 
But far sweeter than the -
roses and the streamlet unto me, 
is the sunlight face of Bessie, darling Bessie of the lea. 
She is the fairest flower ever sent to comfort me, 
Pure and gentle as an angel, darling Bessie of the lea, 
Yes, she is the fairest flower ever sent to comfort me, 
She is my star and treasure, darling Bessie of the lea, 
Not a 
bird in the wild wood but will answer to her call, 
Oh ! most I 
love the twilight when the pearly dew-drops fall. 
Then she meets me in the valley and she kindly welcomes me, 
My bonnie star of evening, darling Bessie of the lea, 
She is, &c. 
Oh ! the honey bee may linger where the buds and blossoms 
grow, 
The gentle breeze of summer in its fragrance come and go, 
But they all will pass unheeded, for wherever she may be, 
My heart is full of Bessie, darling Bessie of the lea. 
She is, Pcx.

For we shall then meander, 
happy through the grove, 
And while the moonbeams linger, 
We'll softly whisper love; 
There, my little sweetheart, 
I 
will something say, 
That will prove I 
love you 
More and more each day; 
Then, I 
know you'll kiss me, 
Pretty Ida Vane, 
Just one little kiss, love, 
Until we meet again.

My gem or jewel rare;

That's half so fair as thee, 
And there is naught in life, lova. 
That's half so dear to me; 
So do not keep me waiting— 
Hoping all in vain, 
Oh! come and smile upon me,

Oh: grant this one request love,

LITTLE CHURCH AROUND TEE 
CORNER. 
BY J. C. STEWART. 
Air—" The Veteran. 
'Twas in a 
christian land, 
A veteran actor lay, 
Whose sands of life had near run out 
And soon must pass away: 
4` 
I 
fear not death," quoth he, 
"My life has been upright ;" 
A heavenly smile passed o'er his face, 
A 
soul had taken flight, 
But, alas! he was an actor. 
His friends had gathered 'round, 
Their last respects to pay, 
And one who knew his christian heart, 
Now sadly wound his way 
To a 
minister, and begged, 
That he'd read a 
funeral prayer. 
" 
We never pray for Actors, no, 
But, I'll tell you where, 
There's a 
little church around the corner." 
In vain the friends did plead, 
But Sabine would not budge, 
Instead of trying to redeem, 
He fain would be the judge. 
The felon in his cell, 
Or murderer doomed to die, 
Can have a 
sermon read for them 
But not our friend, and why ? 
Alas! he was an actor. 
With pity and disgust, 
The friends now turn toward 
A shepherd, who protects his flock, 
And lives to serve the Lord. 
The service he performed, 
And prayed tor that poor soul, 
The friends discovered they had found 
A Chrlstian, not a 
fool, 
In thli little church around the corn , 
MY pretty Jane, my pretty Jane, 
-What makes you of me shy ? 
Meet me to-night at Taylor's, 
And sip the good old rye. 
The day is dawning fast, my love, 
I 
whisper in your ear; 
The evening soon is corning, love, 
In fact is almost here. 
Then pretty Jane, my pretty Jane, 
I 
beg you, don't be shy, 
But meet me in the evening, 
And sip the good old rye. 
And when you finish your first glass, 
I'll give the bell a 
ring; 
The waiter, in his jacket white, 
To answer it shall spring. 
The day is waning fast, my love, 
I 
whisper in your ear; 
The evening soon is coming, love, 
In fact is almost here. 
Then pretty Jane, my pretty Jane, 
I 
beg you don't be shy, 
But meet me, as I 
have proposed, 
And sip the good old rye.

LIA.RY OF THE WILD mooa 
Zt was on one cold Winter's night, 
As the wind blew across the wild moor, 
When Mary came wanderinz home with her babe, 
'Till she came to her own lather's door. 
I' Oh! father, dear father. she cried, 
Come down and open the door, 
Or the child in my arms will perish and die, 
By the wind that blows across the wild moor. 
° Oh! why did I 
leave this dear spot, 
Where once I 
was harpy and free, 
But now, doomed to roam without friends or horn.s, 
And no one to take pity on me." 
The old man was deaf to her cri, 
Not a 
sound of her voice reached his ear, 
But the watch-doz howled and the village bell tol:

 village clock is striking eight 
As the misty twilight closes, 
And some one stands in the cottage porch, 
Under the clustering roses; 
And ever she gazes down the road, 
Her young heart anxiously beating; 
" 
Why stays he so late •' thinks she, 
Her lips each stroke of the clock repeating 
"Why stays he so late" thins she, 
Her lips each stroke of the clock repeating. 
The village clock is striking ten 
While two *neath., the roses linger, 
And something bright in the fair moonlight, 
Shines on the maiden's finger: 
_ 
And whisrers the youth •' to morrow morn" 
Is he bids good-bye in the door way: 
! 
hasten t'^v coming, Laroy dawn.

Now don't you think it's very nice, in such a 
scene as this, 
To fix your arm around her wait—t:al. a 
gentle kiss, 
And whisper tales of love to her, and press her to your heart, 
And vow by all the purple he,ils your love will ne'er depart? 
Cho. —It's all among the clover, & c. 
Then pluck the gentle clover, that blushes at her feet, 
Then robe your love in garlands, there's nothing half so 
sweet, 
The rose will mantle on her cheek, her eyes will sparkle 
bright, 
All among the clover, on a 
summer's night. 
Cho. — It's all among the clover, & c. 
There's nr,thing in this wile, wide world, could please you

As strolling in the clover, with tales of love to tell; 
It makes your heart rebound with joy, and fills your soul 
with bliss.

AS I 
strayed beneath a 
marble arch, one evening in July, 
A maiden fair, with golden hair, came gently tripping by; 
The lustre of her diamond eyes, shone on me like a 
torch, 
And in a 
whisper soft she said, is this the marble arch? 
Then round her lovely form I 
drew my magic circle, 
I 
pressed her. I 
caressed her, my brain was in a 
whirl, 
Around her lovely form I 
drew my magic circle, 
I 
kissed her and I 
called her a 
very pretty girl. 
I 
took her to a 
shady spot beneath the spreading trees, 
I 
took iold oilier lily-white hand, and fell down on my knees; 
Beloved, cried I, arcsize, said she, and before I 
had time to speak 
t.ne imprinted a 
one burning kiss upon my blooming cheek. 
Then round her lovely form, lc. 
Good-night, says she, in a 
voice so sweet, and gently squeezed 
my hand, 
My knees began to knock and shake, for I 
could scarcely stand; 
We'll meet again some other night, and then prepare to march, 
But where, cried I, she then replied, beneath that marble arch, 
Then round her lovely form, 
However, since that fatal night, I 
have not seen my queen, 
But I've heard them say she's run away with a 
big fat horse 
marine; 
A 
ring I 
give her when we meet, but not as you suppose, 
I'll never put it on her hand, I'll stick it through her nose. 
Then round her lovely form, & c. 
When the corn is waving, Annie dear, 
Oh, meet me by the stile. 
To hear thy gentle voice again, 
And greet thy winning smile. 
The moon will be at full, love, 
The stars will brightly gleam, 
9 
come, my queen of night, love, 
And grace the beauteous scene. 
6110.--When the corn is waving, Annie dear, 
Oh, meet me by the stile, 
To hear thy gentle voice again, 
And greet thy winning smile. 
When the corn is waving, Annie dear, 
Our tales of love we'll tell, 
Beside the gentle flowing stream, 
That both our hearts know well. 
When wild flowers in their beauty, 
Will scent the evening breeze, 
Oh haste, the stars are peeping, 
And the moon, behind the trees.

In her " little bed" we laid her, 
When the roses lost their bloom, 
A.nd a 
valley- grave we made her, 
Close beside her mother's lonely tomb; 
Little birdie sang his sad notes, 
As her spirit passed away, 
Ere she sought the home of angels, 
In the land of perfect day. 
0E1°n-us—Little birdie sing your sweetest, 
For, darling is an angel now, 
She is free from pain and sorrow, 
With love's star upon her heavenly brow, 
Far too lovely was our darling, 
For this cold and bitter life, 
And although we weep to miss her, 
She is free from mortal worldly strife; 
And we dream her angel mother, 
Strolzes again her darling's head, 
And, amid angelic music. 
Lays her in her little bed. 
Little birdie, &c.

Darling is an angel now,

In the angel home above us, 
Let this cheer our mournful heart.

FAREWELL to thee Erin, dear home of my childhood, 
Farewell to thy valleys, thy mountains and hills ; 
Farewell to thy lakes and thy evergreen wildwood, 
Farewell to thy brooks and thy murmuring rills; 
11\To more shall I 
dwell in the land of my sires, 
No more thy green banner above me shall wave; 
Forever is quenched freedom's bright fires, 
For thy tyrants have doomed me the life of a 
slave. 
In exile and bondage in my dreams still I 
wander, 
To every loved object will fond memory soar; 
And on thy lost glories forever will ponder, 
Dear land of my fathers, old Erin-go-Bragh ! 
But the battle is over, and the cause we have fought for 
Is lost to us now, yet one boon would I 
crave, 
That still I 
may find what in battle I 
sought for, 
A 
grave ' neath thy shamrock, not the fate of a 
slave. 
Thy green velvet cheek that is kissed by the ocean, 
Now fastly is fading away from my sight; 
But with tears and with, sighs and heartfelt emotion, 
I 
wish thee, dear country, forever good night. 
To the land of the stranger in bondage they bear me, 
Yet grant me, kind heaven, the boon that I 
crave, 
Break though my heart; but this agony spare me, 
Let me die as a 
freeman, and not as a 
slave. 
0, M0'..,LY DAWN, why leave me tilning, 
Or tonely waiting here for you, 
While the stars above are brightly shining, 
Because they've nothing else to do. 
The flowers late were open keeping, 
To try a 
rival blush with you, 
But their mother, "Nature, kept them sleeping 
With their rosy faces washed in dew. 
Ct-fout.Ts. 
0, Molly Dawn, why leave me pining, 
Or lonely waiting here for you, 
While the stars above are brightly shining,' 
Because they've nothing else to do. 
The pretty flowers \yero made to bloom, dear. 
And the pretty stars were made to shine, 
The pretty girls were made for boys, dear, 
And may be you were made for mine. 
The wicked watch dog here is snarling, 
lie takes me for a 
thief, d'ye see, 
For he knows I'd steal you, Molly darling, 
And then transported I 
should be.

The New

A little book has lately appeared in print at Messrs. Fisher & 
Denison's, 93 Nassau street, called "The Little Flirt." We cannot 
say that we recommend i 
t 
to our young lady and gentlemen readers, 
as we think it would only encourage the bad h- bit of "flirting." 
Unfortunately there is enough of it done without any further neces-
sity of explaining " how, when and where to do it," and this little 
'volume would advise and initiate the uncorrupted in practising what 
is commonly called "flirting." 
The N. Y. Evening Telegram writes: 
We have lately seen a 
neat little book, bound in morocco, costing 
cents, called "The Little Flirt," pubdshed by Messrs. Fisher & 
Denison, 98 Nassau street. 
It gives information of the moans oper-
andi of flirting, and of the meaning of every motion of the hand-
kerchief, fan, glove and parasol. As there is nothing at all oljec-
tionahle in the volume, and its contents might afford i-atne innocent 
amusement to many, we do not hesitate to recommend it to our 
young lady and gentlemen readers.
