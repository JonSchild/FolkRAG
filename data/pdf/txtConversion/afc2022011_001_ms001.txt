Question 1 
1.   Thinking back, what are your very earliest memories of, or about, weaving? 
A. Ulithian:  Hobe luluwal tefal ngo mada mele hochil mem’mangi hare gulayem mo irel yam 
la Kai mo gula doh deur? 
Interviewer English: 
00:01 Ok, I am interviewing Conchita Leyangrow.  
Interviewer Ulithian: 
00:09 Con, Leyangrow, hobe lulual tefal ngo mada mele hochil 
memangi mo irel yam la gula doh deur. Makala Wulul yami 
fufeur doh deur mo ralkawe? 
Interviewer English: 
Thinking back, what are your very earliest memories of, or 
about, weaving? 
Interviewee Ulithian: 
00:29 Wulul farol deur? 
Interviewee English:   
How did we weave? 
Interviewer Ulithian:   
00:31 Ngo, hare ifa sangal, hama feur deur mo iya? Ha feur di 
chog deur wototal hare? 
Interviewer English:    
Yes how and where did you weave?  Did you use a warping 
board to make the warp, or did you just make it on the ground? 
Interviewee Ulithian: 
00:41 Sew si feur di chog deur wototal, ngo sew si feur wol meka 
(Maliyel). 
Interviewee English: 
We make the warp on the ground and we also make it on the 
warping board. 
Interviewer Ulithian: 
00:45 Yath kala ngo sa your maliyel? 
Interviewer English: 
Did you have a warping board before? 
Interviewee Ulithian: 
00:46 Igla yor maliyel. 
Interviewee English: 
Yes, now we have a warping board. 
Interviewer Ulithian: 
00:47 Yab yad kawe. 
Interviewer English: 
I mean, in the past.

Interviewee Ulithian: 
00:48 Yath kawe tor maliyel bo si fod fadal chog wototal siya 
chow.  Sibe chowu le be igla chog siya ha maloi. Si towe 
ligdalog bo walsu bo yarmat rede hatwasi. 
Interviewee English: 
In the past, a warping board was still hard to get. So we just 
put sticks in the ground and we made the warp, but we would 
have to finish it because it was in the open and kids and 
people around might break it. 
Interviewer Ulithian: 
01:05 Yok ila sangal? Sibe chowu chog siya yathmagli bo be 
mol, irel makala ye fod dii chog wototal? 
Interviewer English: 
Oh yeah, so you would start and finish it in one session 
because it was just made on the ground and also in an open 
area? 
Interviewee Ulithian: 
01:10 Ngo bo sari, rede hatwasi bo ila ye fod di chog wototal. Te 
wochog iye yemel wol maliyel le be t’mol ngalgich siya haliliyal 
log sulbos. 
Interviewee English: 
The kids could break it because it’s on the ground in an open 
area. It’s not like when it’s on the warping board when, if you 
don’t finish it, you can put it somewhere safe, out of the reach 
of children. 
Interviewer Ulithian: 
01:22 Ewe ngo mada meka hama feur cho (deur) mo iyang? 
Thread hare? 
Interviewer English:  
What do you weave from? Thread, or…? 
Interviewee Ulithian: 
01:31 Yengangel fulyach mele ha kai iyang. Yath kala ngo ted 
yor thread. Ted tapel igla le sa cholop doh thread. Yengangal 
fulyach le yuch mo gulfui. 
Interviewee English: 
We learned how to weave with local fibers because, in those 
days, we hardly had thread. We used banana fibers and 
hibiscus fibers. 
Interviewer Ulithian: 
01:48 Gulfui mulwe… Ifa sangal yach faru gulfui? 
Interviewer English: 
How did you get the fibers from the hibiscus? 
Interviewee Ulithian: 
01:53 Si tolu, si tolu di lited hare lu’chol. Si tayutie mo 
wol  mokawe raal  siya yisin nog lu’chol hare si tolu dii hasisig 
ye la maad ngo siya hamaladah siya hamahla bo sibe 
muslohoi mulwe lal ewe ye harep ngali mulwe gil mele sitaptap 
“Marub” makawe lupuwal  mele sihasi  bo  yach mel deur kea. 
02:25 Yath la be maad makla irel yach tolu dii ngo bele lahloh 
mala lal mo mala lupuwal le ila mele sihasi boy yach mil deur 
kea. Ewe ngo mala lugul le si wol hasi bo yach ifah ewe ngo ila 
bo ye muchagchog. 
Interviewee English: 
We cut the branches, take off the bark, and put them in the 
water (ocean) for some time until the skin layers come apart. 
There are three layers of the hibiscus skin. We use the first 
3 
 
layer (the closest one to the bark) for a kind of lavalava that is 
called “Marub”, and it is used for weft as well. The middle layer 
is the one that is used for weaving the main lavalava that is 
worn by the women. The last layer, next to the wood, is used 
for weft because it easily breaks. 
Interviewer Ulithian: 
02:45 Mulwe lugul? Mulwe lugulwei? 
Interviewer English: 
The layer next to the bark? 
IntervieweeUlithian: 
02:47 Ngo mele ye katab ngali mla gil mele sihasi bo yach ifah. 
Interviewee English: 
Yes. The layer next to the bark is also used for the weft. 
Interveiwer Ulithian: 
02:58 Ila yekatab ngali sifdei? 
Interviewer English: 
What do we do with the layer next to the first layer? 
Interviewee Ulithian: 
03:00 Ewe ngo mala ye katab ngali le ye roh lupuwal, le ila mele 
sihasi bo yach mil dur, yach luguchol hare yol. Ngo mala katab 
ngali irea we mele sihasi bo yach ifah. 
Interviewee English: 
The middle layer is the one we use for the main fibers of the 
weaving and the next to the wood is the one we use for the 
weft. 
Interviewer Ulithian: 
03:18 Le mulwe harep ngal irea we mo mulwe hartal wei irel 
mulwe gil mele sihasi bo ifah? 
Interviewer English: 
So, the layer next to the skin and the layer next to the wood 
are the ones used for the weft? 
Interviewee Ulithian: 
03:25 Mala chog lupuwal mele sihasi bo yach mil cho? 
Interviewee English: 
So the only middle part is the one we use for the warp? 
Interveiwer Ulithian: 
03:31 Gulfui mo mada mele sima taptap irel yengang ralkawe? 
Interviewer English: 
Hibiscus fibers, and what else did we use for weaving in those 
days? 
Interviewee Ulithian: 
03:36 Gulfui chog mo yuch. 
Interviewee English: 
We use hibiscus fibers and banana fibers only. 
Interviewer Ulithian: 
03:40 Pangal metmatal yuch ngo sima taptap hare katot chog. 
Interviewer English: 
Did we use all the different kinds of varieties of banana plants 
for fiber weaving? 
Interviewee Ulithian: 
03:42 Samat chog yuch mele sitaptap. Ewe ngo mulwe luchul 
long le ye maching.  Mulwe wol ngachel wei, Mulwe katabdi 
irel mulwe gil mele si hasi bo yach ifah. 
Interviewee English: 
There’s only one variety of banana plant whose fibers we use 
for weaving. The banana stalk is layered and, in the layers, 
4 
 
there are only certain portions that we take because some 
portions are easily broken. 
Interviewer Ulithian: 
04:11 Ifa sangal wulul dedeur ralkawe? Irel ahh… Yor deur le 
sifaru bo yar mal mo yar fafel? 
Interview English: 
How or what kind of lavalava were you making in those days? 
Were you weaving lavalava for both women and men? 
Interviewee Ulithian: 
04:23 Hale ngo…Yar mal si hoho chog yuch. Yuch mele sihoho 
rel yar mal yar fafel si hoho yuch, si hoho gulfui. 
Interviewee English: 
For men’s lavalava, we use banana fibers only.  For women’s 
lavalava, we use both banana fibers and hibiscus fibers. 
Interviewer Ulithian: 
04:35 Beyog be gulfui mo yuch hare gulfui gulfui chog hare? 
Interviewer English: 
Can we make a lavalava out of hibiscus only, or does it have to 
be hibiscus and banana fiber? 
Interviewee Ulithian: 
04:40 Ngo…Si hasi mulwe ye katab ngali la we, iwe mo mulwe 
lugul ewe ngo mulwe puwal mele si hasi bo yach lugchol mo 
yol. Mulwe katab ngali mulwe gil mele sihasi bo yach ifah mo 
ewe ye katabngali yerawe. 
Interviewee English: 
Yes, the layers next to the wood and the layer next to the bark 
are used for weft and the middle layer is used for the warp. 
Interviewer Ulithian: 
05:04 Ewe ngo ifa meka si taptap marub iyang? 
Interviewer English: 
Which layers do we use for “Marub” (a style/design of 
lavalava)? 
Interviewee Ulithian: 
05:07 Mulwe ye katab ngali irea we. Sibe sei loh, siya tolu ewe 
ngo sa lagloh sedal mo sedal. Iwe lupuwal me sihasi bo yach 
mil deur ngo mala lugul mele sihasi bo yach marub. 
Interviewee English: 
The layers we used for “Marub” is the one next to the bark. 
Interviewer Ulithian: 
05:30 Fudow layers irel gufui 3? 
Interviewer English: 
How many layers are there on the hibiscus skin? 
Interviewee Ulithian: 
05:37 Ngo suldal. Sew ila ye ketab ngal irea la, sew ila lupuwal, 
le ila mele si hasi bo mil deur kea ewe ngo ila lugul mele sihasi 
bo yach marub. Ikala meka hamem hakia doh muswe, 
motamol yamem kai. 
Interviewee English: 
There are three layers. One close to the bark, the middle layer, 
then the last layer (easily breaks) next to the wood. 
Interviewer Ulithian: 
05:56 Iwe ila ngo sulmat deur le yamat refefeur ralkawe? 
Interviewer English: 
So, there were three different designs that you did in those 
days? 
5 
 
Interviewee Ulithian: 
05:59 Ngo. Guluch, Marub, Gulfe. Yar maal si hoho chog yuch. 
Si hoho yuch irel lugchol ngo si hoho yuch irel yuelol.  Igla siya 
mechrag bo so your thread. 
Interviewee English: 
Yes. Guluch, Marub, and Gulfei. Guluch is the style for men, 
and we only used banana fibers. It’s much easier now that we 
have (commercial) threads. 
Interviewer Ulithian: 
06:33 Ewe ngo ifa sangal, sibis ngo re dedeur log chog irel 
immear hare, sima log irel immar fafel siya dedeur. 
Interviewer English: 
Do the women do their weaving at their house or do they go to 
the women’s house to do the weaving? 
Interviewee Ulithian: 
06:47 Sew ila sangal buwa fangal, ay sibe  chufangal sibe 
yengang.  Iwe resa bidi  buwa fangal ipol fafel resa 
yengang.   Sibe “Habullap” ngo sima yengang fengal.  Tapel 
mala, hare gich ngo sibe yangang fangal deur. 07:13 Hare semal 
chog ngo ye feur yal deur ilang semal ngo depal hare be bidi 
ipol hare be yagloh. 
Interviewee English: 
Sometimes women gather at the women’s house to do the 
weaving. Sometimes two or three people like to get together 
and weave. This is called “Habullap”. Or, if an individual like to 
weave on her own, then it’s up to her if she likes to stay home 
or go to the women’s house to weave. 
Interviewer Ulithian: 
07:31 Iwe ngo ma ifa yodol ngo sa mol sew deur? 
Interviewer English: 
How long does it take to finish one lavalava? 
Interviewee Ulithian: 
07:41 Ye fithiy chog yach yangang.  Hare yetir yam yangtali hare 
tapel molwe hote pepai tangi bo ho deur chog. Hare ho maro 
ngali chog ilang be igla chog ngo ye mol. 
Interviewee English: 
It depends on each weaver. If the weaver puts the effort into 
weaving and does not do other stuff, then the lavalava can be 
finished in one day. 
08:42 Question 2 
2.   In your mind, who is the one person you most associate with weaving in your life and 
why? 
A. Ulithian:  Lol yam luluwal, itei semal le ye kael yam fel ngali irel yam fefaru doh deur 
hare yam deduer doh?  Bo mada fal? 
Interviewee Ulithian: 
08:58 Ifel ngalir rechoke igula bo re wegdeg ngal yei 
ngo  remommai ngal yei.  Mala bisil seley mele ye kael yai fel 
ngali bo yal teach igli yei doh deur ngo te ma kaftorai ngal 
yei.  Ma mommai chog yal haskuna yei.  
Interviewee English: 
I associate it with those that were good to me, but my maternal 
aunt is the one I most associate it with and learned weaving 
from.  She was patient with me.

09:45 Question 3 
3.   Why is weaving so important to you? 
A.   Ulithi: Mada mele dedeur ye kael yal palengpelal ngalug iyang? 
Interviewee Ulithian: 
09:52 Ye paling pelal bo e-hapalpal, ngo, pangal meka bela wel

iyang.  Ila mele ikangalir pangal makala wol laiy.  E hawaresi 
ngalir chog dedeur ila pangar ngo resalap irel deur. 
Interviewee English: 
Weaving lavalava is very important because we use it for 
clothing.  We also used to pay for healing massages when our 
kids, ourselves, or any of our relatives get hurt. When our girls 
reach maturity/womanhood, we make them wear woven skirts. 
That is why I have been teaching my kids how to weave so 
they know how. 
11:51 Question 4 
4.   How has weaving or woven skirts changed over your lifetime, or since the lifetime of 
those who taught you? 
A.   Ulithi:  Ifa sangal yal deur mo dedeur susuwel doh irel yam bubudoh yesa holadoh 
igla? Hare sa change tangi Yathkawe ho k’kai mor irel sensei kala yam? 
Interviewer Ulithian:

Interviewer English: 
How has weaving or woven skirts changed over your lifetime, 
or since the lifetime of those who taught you? 
Interviewee Ulithian: 
12:09 Siya ligda loh meka yengangal fulyach. Siya milngali chog

Interviewee English: 
These days, we tend to leave behind the local ways and turn to 
commercial thread because it’s easier. Back then, we only 
worked with the hibiscus and banana fibers. Thread does not 
have value compared to the local woven skirts in our 
culture. With the local fibers, it is us that do all the work to get 
the fibers from the hibiscus and banana trees. So that is the 
value of the local lavalava. These days, every time families 
gather to collect woven skirts for occasions, all are skirts 
woven out of the thread we bought from the stores, and we 
always wish for the locally made ones.    
13:47 Question 5  
5.    If you could talk to your great-great daughter about weaving, what would you want to tell 
her? 
A.   Ulithian:  Hare wochog bo hobe malili ngal lol lom tarfefel irel deur, mada mele hobe 
kangalur hare hodipli hobe kangalur? 
Interviewee Ulithian: 
14:03 Ibe kangalur bo rebe kai.  Rebe kai deur, Cho, ye deduer 
meka yengangal fulyach bo rebe gula.  Te tapel rechokea retai 
gulale resa mil chog thread.  Ewe ngo yengangal fulyach mele 
yor pelal ngal gich, ngo siya ligdaloh.  Ila mele ikangalur bo reb 
kabung yengangal fulyach. 
Interviewee English: 
I will tell my great-granddaughter that they need to learn 
weaving, especially weaving the local fibers because it’s 
valuable. 
Interviewer Ulithian: 
14:32 Ila chog mele hobe kangalur hare? 
Interviewer English:   
Is that all you want to tell your great-granddaughters? 
Interviewee Ulithian: 
14:36 Ngo, ila mele ikangalur bo rebe kabung meka yengagnal 
fulyach. Bo rebele dabei chog thread, ngo be tor loch salapi 
ngo tor mele sibe chuwayi ngali thread kawe. Te we yengangal 
fulyach le sifaru ngal peuch siya yengang. 
Interviewee English: 
Yes, I want to tell them to learn how to do the local weaving 
because if we don’t have money then we can’t buy the thread 
to weave.  For the local fibers, you don’t need money to go cut 
the hibiscus branches and banana trunk to make your fibers 
for the lavalava. 
Interviewer Ulithian: 
14:56 Hare mo tor salpi ngo be mol hobe feur? 
Interviewer English: 
Even if you don’t have money, you can still weave your woven 
skirt? 
Interviewee Ulithian: 
15:01 Ngo bo siya feur ngal peoch. Si radu yuch, si supi gulfe, 
ewe ngo gich mele siyengang iyang.  Te we tapel salpi le sii 
chuwai thread ngo be tor chog salpi, towe yor yach thread. 
Interviewee English: 
Yes, because we can do all the work and weave our skirts 
without spending money. Not like the thread that we have to 
8 
 
buy.  If you have no money, then you don’t have a woven skirt 
when you use thread.
