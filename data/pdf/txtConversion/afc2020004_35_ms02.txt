[Mahealani Perez-Wendt reads "Na Wai Eā, The Freed Waters"] 
 
Mahealani Perez-Wendt:  Thus ends the poem "Na Wai Eā, The Freed Waters.” This poem is 
dedicated to my husband, Ed Wendt, a life-long Kalo farmer. 
 
Their story of this community is very complex, but I wanted in some small way to honor the 
indigenous farmers, fishermen, hunters and gatherers of East Maui who still live the traditional 
subsistence lifestyle of their ancestors. They fought nearly two centuries to restore water taken 
by U.S. businessmen and their successor corporations. Finally in 2018, their dedicated efforts 
resulted in the largest water restoration in Hawai`i's history. The siphoning off of water away 
from indigenous communities enabled a U.S. sugar plantation economy in Hawai`i throughout 
the 1800's up through current times until the last plantation closed down in 2016.  
 
Interwoven in the poem is the story of Hāloanakalaukapalili (or Haloa Naka), the taro plant. 
Hāloa Naka, child of Papa (Earth Mother) and Wākea (Sky Father) was stillborn. He was buried, 
his mother's tears at the grave nurturing growth of the first kalo plant, which became our 
traditional staple food. A second son was born, also named Hāloa, progenitor of all humans. 
There is reciprocity—Haloa Naka is revered and cared for as our elder brother who feeds and 
cares for us in return. Other Hawaiian gods associated with wai, water, and `āina, land, are also 
important to this story. It is the story of a people whose resistance and unbroken connection to 
ancestral gods, family, land, water, and all of the universe has sustained them since the 
beginning, and will continue to sustain them until the end of time. Aloha.
