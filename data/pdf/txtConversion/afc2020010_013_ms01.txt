Transcript of Interview with Jason Mullins, February 19, 2020 
By Ethan Sharp 
Ethan (00:00:03): 
This is Ethan Sharp. I'm here with Jason Mullins. It's February 19th, 2020. And Jason, maybe you could just 
start by telling us well where you were born, where you grew up. Give a little bit of a background on 
yourself and then we can talk about how you got into this line of work that you're in. 
Jason (00:00:26): 
I was born in Wise, Virginia, 1979. I was born to a single mom. She was 17 years old when I was born, a 
very exceptional woman. Put herself through college with me in tow. So you know, further on in my 
addiction later on, like, I always had her to draw back on too, because that strength that she had to, to 
not let having a child at such a young age hold her back, you know. So biological dad ran off when I was a 
baby. So she did that. She put herself through college, me living with her. I remember going to classes 
with her and sitting under a desk, coloring. And I remember going out in the hallway and playing with little 
matchbox cars, you know. Some of it, I remember, some of the stories she tells me, cause I was awful 
young. And then we ended up settling in Kentucky in Harlan County, let's see, when I was in eighth grade. 
And so I was probably 12, 13, around that time. We moved around a lot in between there. She got married 
when I was four, and they were young parents. So we moved around in Virginia and then ended up in 
Kentucky, and I've been in Kentucky pretty much ever since. 
Jason (00:01:57): 
So I had a pretty good childhood. You know what I mean? There were, like any childhood, I think, there 
were, there were some ups and downs, and you know, I had some trauma early on, which you know, 
which is something that's very common when it comes to addicts. There's usually some kind of childhood 
trauma. And that's, that's true in my story. But you know, for the most part, like I never needed anything. 
They always made sure we had what we needed. You know, there was no abuse at home or anything like 
that. So like I lived in, I grew up in a pretty, you know, normal, for the most part, home. Was--I excelled in 
sports. I excelled in academics. Was captain of the football teams, all state. Graduated top of my class. I 
had a congressional appointment to West Point military academy. Lots of scholarship offers, not just for 
football, but also for academics, but that's also when my addiction started becoming prominent in my life. 
I had tinkered with things throughout high school and stuff, but it was around that last year of high school, 
first year of college, when things started really taking on, when addiction took on a new meaning. And I 
think it was, you know, I went to college when I was 17. I think I was, I could have used another year at 
home, another year of maturity before going off to college, when there was a lot of freedom and I don't 
know that I was ready for it at the time. You know, so a lot of drinking. 
Ethan (00:03:40): 
Where did you go to college? 
Jason (00:03:40): 
The first, I went to several colleges. This is a result of my addiction. The first one was, at that time, it was 
called Clinch Valley College. Now it's called the University of Virginia in Wise. It was always, I think, a part 
of the University of Virginia, but they ended up changing the name of it. Or maybe they took it over. I'm 
not really sure how that happened, but at that time it was Clinch Valley College. Now it's the University of 
2 
 
Virginia at Wise. Didn't do well there that first semester. I, I drank a lot. Didn't go to class very much and 
ended up basically flunking out and had to move back home. Went to community college for a semester. 
Got a job. Did well during that time. I drank some during that time, but it wasn't--I was living in the home, 
so it wasn't like I could do it like I had done when I was off living in college. Then I ended up going to Union 
College my sophomore year, and I was there for three years. I have enough college credits to probably 
have a master's degree, but I don't. My last year at Union, the second year at Union, I actually got hurt 
during a football game. And I had to have surgery on my hand, and I was prescribed Vicodin. So up to this 
point, I had done a lot of drinking. And during lots of periods, it was daily drinking, but never really fooled 
with drugs much until I had that surgery, and they gave me that prescription of Vicodin. And didn't really 
even know that it was a thing, you know, but I had, you know, the guys on the team from other places, 
other states and stuff, and they found out I had those and was coming and wanting them. And I was like, 
what is this? What are y'all? Why do y'all want these? I mean, they're trying to pay me 10 bucks a pop for 
a pill. 
Jason (00:05:54): 
And I'm like--so I got curious and tried it myself. And you know, and then that led into a pretty good Lortab 
habit and just turned into an Oxycontin habit, you know. And didn't finish with my degree. And then that, 
that set me on a journey for many years of chasing that high, chasing, not so much--and there's a big 
misconception that an addict is out there just trying to, trying to feel good, trying to party all the time. It 
wasn't like that for me. It was really more trying to feel normal. It was really more trying to, to cover up 
pain, internal pain, trying to cover up feelings that I didn't want to feel, trying to numb them out, you 
know. And that went on for a long time. And 2007, I started trying to get clean. It was when I actually, 
probably started trying around 2006. 2007, I got clean for the first time. And then here we are, it's 2020. 
So I've spent 13 years actively trying to get clean and stay clean. And there was a lot of failures. I'd get 
clean for a while, and then I'd relapse. I'd get clean for a while, and then I'd relapse. And you know, during 
all that time, I went to a lot of treatment centers, you know, multiple treatment centers. One thing that I 
noticed, especially now looking back that was always missing was that, other than the relationship with 
the people that were in the program, that commonality that we got, that brotherhood, you know, there 
wasn't a lot of staff that had firsthand experience with addiction. Most of what they, they knew they 
learned in books. 
Jason (00:08:05): 
You know, and I'm not knocking counselors at all because we have some of the best that there are here 
at the Isaiah House. And they, they provide a very, very important vital role in recovery and in the mental 
health as a whole. But I needed that guy that could sit there across from me, look me in the eye, and say, 
"I know. I've been there. I felt like that. I know what that's like," you know what I'm saying? And when, 
when I explained, when I would explain something like I'm not doing this to just feel good, you know, for 
somebody to be able to tell you, "You know what, I know. I wasn't either." So I think that's one thing that 
drew me to peer support later on. And it really drew me back in those days to programs, 12 step programs, 
and for sake of tradition, I'll not name them, but because there's the fellowship that exists within those. 
Ethan (00:09:18): 
And what was the key for you to getting clean? Was it-- 
New Speaker (00:09:27): 
3 
 
It was pain. It was pain. I get asked that a lot if there was that one thing. 2007, I got clean just because, I 
don't know why I really. Like I didn't--I was miserable, you know, I was, I was homeless. Didn't have a job. 
So I was offered an opportunity to move back in with my dad under the demands that I stay clean and 
sober. And that was like a, you know, kick in the hind end that I needed at the time. And it worked, it 
worked for a while. I started doing well over a year during that time. And was very active in recovery 
groups. But then it--I had gotten an abscessed tooth, and see there's a lot more to recovery than just not 
using. The not using is really the easy part. It's the learning how to live, is the hard part. Because a lot of 
times, you know, an addict has to relearn how to live, has to really relearn how to do daily things. For me, 
mine started so early, like I had to, I didn't know how to live, period. I went to college when I was 17--My 
addiction took off and like, I didn't know how to pay bills. I didn't know to carry insurance on a car. I didn't 
know how to do nothing. So like, that's the, and I wasn't addressing those things in my recovery. I was just 
not using. I was just not picking up. So over a period of time, I become ungrateful for the fact that I, that I 
wasn't using. I felt stuck because I wasn't growing. And I got an abscessed tooth, and funny how it 
happened, walked into work. And the guy that I had, a coworker, he came on and said, "Is your tooth still 
bothering you?" I said yeah. And he held out his hand and he said, "Here, this will help." And he dropped 
it in my hand and I didn't even look at it. Popped it into my mouth. And then I went out and got on my 
forklift--and I was working at a grocery distribution center at time--and I remember thinking, oh, no, what 
have you done? So, you know, then that started me off a year, year and a half, you know, of all the way 
back out there. I ended up losing the job, that job. And it's just the same old story. And, and then I come 
to Isaiah House again. 
Ethan (00:12:18): 
So you had been here? 
Jason (00:12:18): 
Yes, three times. Took me three times. So then I come back, then I come here, and it was the first time I 
had been in long-term, any kind of long-term treatment. All I'd ever done before was short-term. Long-
term is extremely important. And there's not enough of that. And what's sad about it is, there's not 
enough of it because the government won't support it. The government wants to put everybody, get 
everybody in detox, and throw them on Suboxone and get them back to work, so they start paying their 
taxes. They ain't really trying to fix the problem. They're just trying to make sure the money keeps rolling 
in. 
Ethan (00:13:04): 
So how much is, how many months is long-term usually? 
Jason (00:13:08): 
Long-term is a year. Some, some long terms are 18 months, you know. Long-term here is a year, which 
consists of residential, IOP, outpatient, sober living, time in the sober living house, you know. 
Ethan (00:13:34): 
So you were talking about coming back here. 
Jason (00:13:36): 
Getting here was like a big commitment to me because I was, you know, I have, I had a, I have a daughter. 
Still have here, but she was a lot younger then. She was maybe six, five at that time. So you know, and 
4 
 
even in my addiction, like I could maintain enough a day a week that I would get her and spend time with 
her. So this would be really the first time in her life, you know, that I was going to be going weeks and 
months without seeing her. So it was a big commitment. It was just a really difficult thing to do. But I was 
really at a place where like I had lost all hope. I, I felt like if this don't work, I don't know. I don't know. 
All's I know is I gotta do something, you know? So I come here and things went well for a while, and I did 
well, you know. There's, there's addicts out there that we, we affectionately call rehab rock stars. You 
know, they can do great while they're in treatment, but once they leave the bubble, once they leave the 
nest, they don't, they don't function so well, you know, and that was me. 
Jason (00:15:02): 
Like, I could, I could walk the walk, talk the talk, you know, but I couldn't live it. So the latter part of my 
time here then, where I could come and go as I pleased, I was in the later stages of the program, I ended 
up meeting a girl that was also in recovery who had less time sober than I did. And I only had maybe eight 
months at the time. I think she maybe had four or five, six months, something like that. So we get together, 
and it's two months, we relapsed together. And then that, that set off two years of very, very difficult 
times. We ended up having a child together. When the child was born, it had drugs, she had drugs in her 
system. So social services got involved immediately. Two months after she was born, her mom died in my 
arms of an overdose, and that was eight years ago. So that's still something that, it's been very difficult, 
you know. There was a lot that come with that too. There was, there was the loss of the child. The child is 
not in my life today. That's a consequence that I have to live with. You know what I'm saying? Like getting 
in recovery doesn't, you don't automatically just get everything back. And some things we don't get it 
back. And that's one of those things that I've not gotten back that I've had to learn how to live with. There, 
there were legal things. There were accusations that I had some kind of involvement in it. So there was a 
lot of, a lot of difficult things going on, and it's really, whatever someone believes about miracles, it's really 
a miracle that I didn't kill myself, you know, during that time, being accused of things that I didn't do, 
which, you know, I was never charged and it had come out that it wasn't true, you know. But just the, just 
the being accused of that. And it being somebody that I, that I loved. You know what I mean? Like it was 
hard. And then the loss of the kid, and I lost my home that night and everything, you know. So I ended up 
coming back here again mourning, mourning, mourning her death, mourning the loss of the child, not--
uncertainty of not knowing if I'm going to be able to be in her life and what that's going to look like or 
anything. And I only lasted here about three months at that time, you know, and I ended up leaving, and 
then I, and I hit out for about six months. I went to my mom's. She let me stay in the guest bedroom. I was 
drawing unemployment. And I just sat there and drank. I didn't know what else to do. I was so miserable, 
you know. 
Jason (00:18:16): 
And then I ended up coming back again after, you know--I almost did some, I almost did some real 
mourning during that time, even though I was drinking a lot. Everybody's past is different. I firmly believe 
that a part of me needed that. So when I come back, it was really, it was really more or less a God thing. 
In the sense that, God had always told me that I was supposed to be doing this kind of work, but I didn't 
want to do it. And I ran from it. 
Ethan (00:19:07): 
You felt that sense, you had felt that for years. 
Jason (00:19:10): 
5 
 
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Addicts, were selfish and self-centered, you know, and I didn't wanna help nobody else. 
You know what I'm saying? I just wanted to do for me. But God don't work like that. He didn't leave me 
alone till I finally decided to come back. And I come back and ended up getting an internship here and 
worked on the case management team. I finished an associate's degree. That's when I got, you know--I 
was, that's actually when I got certified as a, as a peer support specialist. Well, I got the associate's degree, 
and then I got the peer support certification. We had a counselor, and I don't remember what her name 
was. But she come through, and worked there for maybe a month. It was all she worked there, but she 
told me about this new certification that you could get, the adult peer support specialist. And so I looked 
into it, and, and I even asked five or six other people that are, that were interns if they were interested in 
going. Nobody wanted to go. And at that time, it was, it was taught through the division of behavioral 
health. It wasn't, it wasn't taught by places like Isaiah House, Centerstone, or Bluegrass.org or anywhere 
like that. So it was free. You didn't have to pay anything for it. I worked second shift, so I was able to go 
to the training and then just come into work, and you know, work till late at night to get everything that I 
needed to get done done. And it was just a week. It started out with-- 
Ethan (00:20:52): 
Thirty hours? 
Jason (00:20:55): 
Yes. Basically the same curriculum that I use. Like it's been adjusted some, ours has, the one that we 
submitted and got approved, but it's, you know, a lot of this very similar, same stuff. It meets the same 
standards that the state set. 
Ethan (00:21:09): 
So what year did you, did you do that? 
Jason (00:21:11): 
This was in 2014. 
Ethan (00:21:13): 
So it was a pretty new thing. 
Jason (00:21:14): 
Yeah, at that time, nobody knew what it was. Never even heard of it, you know, like very few people even 
knew anything about it. The cool thing about peer support and it being used in addiction treatment today 
is that it was originally designed for mental health, more than anything else. People suffering from things 
like bipolar, schizophrenia, you know, people , who had learned to maintain and live a productive life with 
those mental illnesses, you know, to be able to support peers to do the same thing, you know. But really 
peer support has been around since 1935, when Bill Wilson went and did the 12 step call on Dr. Bob and 
helped Dr. Bob get sober. And then AA was founded, you know, and it's based off peer support. So it's 
really been around. 
Ethan (00:22:18): 
So it's similar to a sponsor. Someone has asked me that, like, what's the difference between a sponsor. 
6 
 
Jason (00:22:21): 
There's a big difference, but there are similarities in the sense that it's using your own personal experience, 
your own story, to relate and to help someone else with, with similar experiences. You know, in the Big 
Book, it talks about a great freightliner. And it talks about that basically, let's say you have someone in 
there on that boat that barely got on that boat. Couldn't barely afford to get on it, so he's sleeping in the 
bottom of the boat, you know, and he's eating cheese sandwiches, you know, cause he can't afford no 
better. And then you got the guy that's up there at the top eating at the captain's table. They don't have 
anything in common, but when that Titanic hit that iceberg and that thing started sinking, now they've 
got a common peril. Now they've got something in common and that's peer support and that's 
sponsorship. So there's your similarity between peer support specialist and a sponsor. But then, you know, 
there's, there's a whole other level of ethics involved and professionalism when it comes to being a peer 
support specialist that you, you don't see in sponsorship. You know what I'm saying? There's, there's a 
greater level of intimacy in sponsorship, but there's a very high level of intimacy in peer support too, 
because of the suffering from the common peril. And not just suffering from the common peril but also 
having a common solution, you know. Because those guys that are on that boat and that boat starts 
sinking--they didn't have anything in common before it started sinking--when it started sinking, they did. 
But the life boats come rescue them. They get back to shore, what happens? They go their separate ways 
because they don't have anything in common anymore. The thing that holds addicts in recovery together 
is not just that we have a common problem, but there's the common solution, of living a life of recovery 
that keeps us together after we get on the shore, you know. So there's differences, but there's similarities 
as well. 
Ethan (00:24:32): 
Is there, is there a schedule that you kind of stick to when you're working with someone or is it sort of as, 
as needed? 
Jason (00:24:44): 
Like how often we meet with them. It depends. Sometimes it's as needed, and sometimes we give them 
homework. They come back with the homework. We go over homework. Give them so more homework. 
It kind of depends on where they're at. And one of the big things about peer support is, is to help them 
to, is to advocate for them, but to also help them to learn to advocate for themselves, you know, because 
not everyone's recovery looks exactly the same. So as a peer support specialist--as a sponsor, I could go 
to someone and say, "Look, here's what I have to offer. If you don't want it, then I can't help you because 
this is all I got. You're going to do it my way, or we're not going to do it at all." But with peer support 
specialists, my job, part of our job is to help them find their own way, what works for them. You know 
what I'm saying? Because it may not look exactly the same, you know, so I can't just set this standard, this 
is the way we do it, this cookie cutter approach, which is the problem we have in addiction treatment 
today. 99% of them follow this cookie cutter approach. And, you know, it's like, you know, somebody 
come in here with a box and they, they wanted to put you in it. And you got in that box, you fit in that 
box, but you barely fit in that box. I'm quite a bit bigger than you. I'm not going to fit in that box. So in 
order to get a box to fit me, the box has got to be built around me. It's the same way with treatments, 
same way with recovery, you know, that person-centered approach. 
Jason (00:26:17): 
I'm actually going to a training next week that's specifically about recovery planning and the person-
centered approach and things like that, because not everybody's recovery is going to be the same, because 
7 
 
we're not all the same. We're addicts. We have common, a common thing, but we're different. Right. So 
just because it worked for you, don't mean it's gonna work for me. Just because it worked for me, doesn't 
mean it's going to work for you. So that's a big part of it, is helping them find their own way and being 
open, you know, to helping them on their path. Because it's their path. It's not me sitting there and 
diagnosing them and telling them about themselves. It's about me listening to who, what they're saying 
who they are, and me telling them who I am and my experiences, finding that commonality, and then 
finding a path for them. 
Ethan (00:27:16): 
Can you tell us a little bit about Isaiah House? A little bit of the history, and then maybe how it's changed 
with, you know, with some of the things that have happened. 
Jason (00:27:28): 
Well, the funny thing about Isaiah House, and we're talking about peer support, is that is what it was 
founded on that, really and truly. It was founded in, I think, it started in 99, Mark LaPalme. And he actually 
started taking in homeless people in his house. And then he ended up getting a bigger house donated, 
and he moved into that. And, and it was really just operating as a homeless shelter, but then he started 
noticing people kept coming back. They'd come, you know, they'd clean them up, feed them, give them 
some clothes, get them a job. And then they'd leave. And then they'd come back with the same problems, 
you know. And Mark's in recovery too, Mark LaPalme, the founder and CEO, you know, so he wasn't no 
dummy to, to addiction and to what addicts do. So he started, and they kept coming back, so that's when 
he shifted his focus from just being a homeless shelter to being, you know, a recovery ministry, 
Ethan (00:28:31): 
And at that time, he's working out of Willisburg? 
Jason (00:28:34): 
Or at that time, it was in Hustonville. 99% Sure. If I'm wrong, it's somewhere around there. I'm pretty sure 
it's Hustonville. Check that fact. I'm pretty sure that's where it was at. But, and then from there, like see 
at that time, it was, it was him, his family and the guys in the program. Peers. It was just peers then. Mark 
didn't have specific peer support training. But it was still peer based. So, and then the relationship within 
the guys, within the house, you know, there's a peer support that, that's involved in that too. I think in 
2007, 2008, maybe 2008, they got the house, the old school in Willisburg. Moved over there. It was similar 
to the way that it was in Hustonville, just got much bigger. More guys in the program. Things went on. 
Eventually they were able to take insurance. They got some counselors on board. Some licensed clinicians 
on board. Started taking the insurance. 
Ethan (00:29:52): 
Did they, did they use twelve steps? 
Jason (00:29:56): 
No. During those early periods, it was more, it was Bible. And then there was, there was a curriculum of 
books, such as Battlefield of the Mind, Grace Walk, Victory over the Darkness, Hidden Value of a Man. 
And these, those books were like the core curriculum other than, than the Bible. But as time went on, we 
started instituting Celebrate Recovery, which is a big thing that we use here, you know. And even in, you 
know, peer support, we'll use the 12 steps a lot, you know, and the literature that comes from the various 
8 
 
12-step programs, you know. And that's all part of that trying to help them find their path. You know what 
I'm saying? I love the Bible. Celebrate Recovery didn't work for me. You know what I'm saying? But some 
of the other 12-step programs do. That's where I find my continued ongoing recovery. So, so in peer 
support, we try not to say, "You got to do it this way. You gotta do it that way. It's gotta be like this," 
because that's trying to do a cookie cutter approach and not help them find, cause if they find their own 
path, it'll stick. Trying to make them conform to something else, it doesn't stick, not in my experience 
anyway. 
Ethan (00:31:19): 
So that's probably a change that you've seen at Isaiah House? 
Jason (00:31:22): 
Absolutely. Become much more open to things. You know, like the Bible's here, and it ain't going nowhere. 
But seeing that it can be combined with other sources, and it become very beneficial tools for people's 
long-term recovery, because that's the goal, is long-term recovery. It's living a life free of addiction. It's 
not the constant evolving door. And you see it all the time, the guys in and out, in and out, for years and 
years and years before they finally get it, if they survive, if they live through it. 2014, I went and got the 
peer support certification. I worked here for a little while as a case manager. After that, I ended up leaving. 
2016, I came back to start the peer support department here. I've been here ever since then. Started out 
with me and a little old 10 by 10 office, with one group of 12 guys. 
Ethan (00:32:34): 
So that means you manage the peer support specialists and also provide the training? 
Jason (00:32:39): 
Yep. Yep. So it went from that little room, me and 12 guys, to me doing, doing one group a day to doing 
two groups a day, to doing three groups a day to doing four groups today. And then I got another peer 
support specialist and another one and then another one. And, you know, so then now we're doing peer 
support in three different locations, and we got our curriculum approved, you know, so we do the trainings 
about every three months to certify other peer support specialists, which, you know, we, we put people 
from our program, from our, that work for us in it, but also people from the outside, from other programs 
come to our training. 
Ethan (00:33:18): 
About how many do you have working for you that are peer support specialists? 
Jason (00:33:23): 
That are peer support certified or providing the actual service? 
Ethan (00:33:29): 
I guess certified then. 
Jason (00:33:30): 
Well, certified, 25. Maybe. That's just me throwing a number out there. 
9 
 
Ethan (00:33:39): 
But you've got a lot more who are doing that kind of work? 
Jason (00:33:41): 
Well, though, but those, those people that are peer-support certified, they're not doing, they're not 
actually providing the billable service. But they're working in functions such as case management, house 
management, you know, in other areas. So they're still being able to use the training and the tools that 
they learned in that training in that other job. Now, I only have a handful of about five guys that actually 
provide the service, and that's all they do is peer support. 
Ethan (00:34:12): 
Yeah. All right. I don't want to get ahead of myself, but I have heard that there's this new sort of new thing 
in the pipeline, which is the recovery coaches. So how does that compare with-- 
Jason (00:34:35): 
I'm not real sure. I can speculate, but I would think that a recovery coach would be more of a long-term 
paid sponsor type of deal. It's kind of what it sounds like, but I don't know. That's not something that 
we've really looked into yet. Recently, me and seven other employees here got, we were certified as 
nationally, nationally certified intervention professionals. So we're certified to do interventions now, 
which is, is new. For us, it's new. But as far as the recovery coaches, like, I don't really--but what it sounds 
like to me is like a paid sponsor, kind of like a life coach. 
Ethan (00:35:29): 
Yeah. I wasn't sure what the difference was. I just knew that some people were sort of moving from peer 
recovery support specialist to calling themselves recovery coaches. 
Jason (00:35:41): 
Yeah. I don't know. There might even be a certification for that out there that I don't know about. 
Ethan (00:35:49): 
Probably. Well, you, you may get into that at some point. I don't know. 
Jason (00:35:52): 
Yeah. I mean, if that becomes the thing, then that's what we'll do, I guess. 
Ethan (00:35:57): 
But the intervention specialist is, is that, you do the interventions then on site, or is that-- 
Jason (00:36:04): 
No that's where we would actually go to them. There would be like a family member could call in and say, 
"My son needs treatment bad, but we can't get him to go." And then we have a process that we would go 
through to set up the intervention and then to go and perform the intervention, you know, with the family 
and the, the addict to persuade them to come to treatment. Which is pretty cool, like from my perspective, 
and one of my guys was also certified, is that we could--this is cool--is we could be the interventionists to 
10 
 
go get them into treatment and then end up being their peer support specialist through the treatment, 
which would be really cool. 
Ethan (00:36:48): 
Yeah. So when you do the trainings, is that just for folks who are connected to Isaiah House, or is that 
open to everyone? 
Jason (00:36:59): 
It's open to everyone, anyone. The adult peer support specialist, in order to be eligible for that training, 
you have to be in recovery from substance use disorder or from a mental health diagnosis or some kind 
of mental health disorder. So, you know, and it could be schizophrenia, bipolar. 
Ethan (00:37:20): 
So have you had--so obviously you come in, how does that work? You come in contact with people who 
are working in all kinds of recovery programs, I assume. 
Jason (00:37:32): 
Yeah. I mean, we've had people in the trainings that weren't addicts, you know, they're really going to be 
working more in mental health specific setting. We've had people come from several different treatment 
programs. The majority are substance use disorder. There's only been a few that weren't. And the truth 
is, is that often you find one and one with other, you know what I mean? With addiction, there's typically 
some form of mental, mental health issue there somewhere aside from the addiction, whether it's PTSD 
or something like that. And you know, typically someone with a mental health diagnosis, they often abuse 
drugs or alcohol. And so you know, a lot of times it's, it's self-medicating. So is it the chicken or the egg 
kind of thing. So the peer support specialist could be very influential in helping in that area. You know 
what I mean? Because some people develop a mental health issue because they're using, and some people 
use because they have a mental health disorder. 
Ethan (00:38:53): 
And that's part of the training you do? 
Jason (00:38:53): 
It's the co-occurring, co-occurring disorders. We used to do a group here called the DTR, Double Trouble 
in recovery. It was specific for people that had both. Now, we just kind of combined that with the regular 
peer support groups. 
Ethan (00:39:18): 
Well, maybe, so with the peer recovery support specialist, did they do the one-on-one, but they also run 
the groups? 
Jason (00:39:28): 
Yep. We do groups and one-on-ones, so the groups, we do 35 groups a week. 
Ethan (00:39:46): 
Okay. Well, and those are all run by-- 
11 
 
Jason (00:39:50): 
Peer support specialists. So they get those, and then they also get Celebrate Recovery, and then they also 
get clinical groups. And church. So we keep them pretty busy. 
Ethan (00:40:03): 
That's great. So can you, just getting, just to get a little background, so what would happen, just kind of a 
brief outline of what would happen in the, in the group setting? 
Jason (00:40:15): 
Well, usually, you know, when you bring them in, you want to do, like typically in a circle is better. So 
everyone's seeing everyone. And you open it up. Usually it's not much of an issue to get the group 
involved. You open it up to any kind of anything anybody's going through, any kind of struggles that 
anyone's, you know, currently going through. And, you know, being, when residential, actually living here, 
a lot of times we deal with silly things, like their cigarettes. They didn't get to smoke because of this or 
that, you now. Their, their needs aren't getting met to their standards, or as fast as they think they ought 
to, which is typical for an addict. I want what I want when I want it. So, you know, and with that, like they 
can't hit us with something that we don't understand, cause we've all been through the program. So like 
when they, when they come at us with the poor, poor pitiful me over this or that, you know, like, I 
remember feeling that way. This is what I, this is how I understand that today. Years later, I understand 
what this was teaching me. That when I was there, I didn't understand. It really helps them process things. 
Used to, you didn't have that ability or capability to be in a group where you could do that. Because now 
you have a professional who is also a peer, you know, where they can come in here and share what they 
need to share without worry, without worrying about getting in trouble for what they say. There's that 
freedom, you know, to do that. Of course, there are limitations, you know, if they're gonna hurt 
themselves or something, the legal thing, you know, but for the most part, like they can come in here and 
share anything they need to. And it's with somebody who understands, somebody that can say, "Yeah, I 
remember that. I remember feeling that way. I remember not liking that. I remember going through that. 
I remember missing my kids. I remember missing my wife. I remember," you know. And, and being able 
to help him find the reason for it, to find the lesson in it. And that's something that I tell the guys a lot is, 
it doesn't matter what you're going through. There's a lesson. There's something to learn from everything. 
It doesn't matter what it is. And that's what groups consist of a lot of times is, there's a problem, now let's 
find the solution. And typically what I'll do-- 
Ethan (00:43:09): 
And it's just sort of as problems come up? 
Jason (00:43:09): 
Yeah, and there's not a shortage of them. So typically that's how group, you know, how I will run a group. 
We'll come in. I open it up. They hit me with a problem. I'll usually let a few of them share to get some 
relation on the problem. Because he shares about this problem, then this guy here is probably going to 
jump in and say, yeah, me too. And you know, so I'll let that go for just a little bit, you know, and then I 
come in, and I'll do the same thing and relate to it. And then I help steer them towards the solution. Here's 
the lesson. I get it. I understand. But how did we learn from this? Here's the lesson in this. Here's the 
solution to this. So that's typically the way that one would work. And then there's also times that we will 
do, we may do a step study. There may be times when we may study something out of the scripture. 
There may be times when we might watch a testimony or some kind of documentary over addiction and 
12 
 
recovery, something from a celebrity like that. And then we'll spend time processing that and discussing 
that. And with the curriculum that's used here is Living in Balance, the clinicians use that, but occasionally 
we'll pull from that to give more of a peer's standpoint, you know, on some of it, because some of it is like 
12 step programs. And if a clinician who's not an addict, who's not been in a 12 step program, is it better 
for them to teach that portion of their curriculum or better for a peer support specialist, you know, to not 
teach, but to facilitate a group over that? 
Ethan (00:45:05): 
So then you'd probably have meetings where you kind of go over, you know, with the clinicians and other 
members, and you decide how things are going to play out for each person? 
Jason (00:45:12): 
Yeah, we communicate. At this point in time, we're--the clinicians that are here, and I've been here a long 
time. And my, some of my guys have been here a long time. We kinda know. We don't really have to talk 
about who's going to do what. We kinda know now. But we work really well with the clinicians. That was, 
that's part of the training. The curriculum is, is the professionalism of learning how to deal with situations 
that arise, because you may have a clinician that doesn't respect the peer, the peer support specialist, 
and, you know, the peer support specialist of how to, to work professionally and efficiently with the 
counselor, you know. And we have a good relationship with ours. We, we lean on them. They lean on us, 
you know. Because we get information, they don't get. Well, they have, they have education that we don't 
always have. So it takes both. 
Ethan (00:46:17): 
And folks that you would train, who don't work for Isaiah House, is it kinda the same for them? Are they're 
working sort of in a similar setting, or are the-- 
Jason (00:46:27): 
Some are, and some work in the outpatient setting. We have, that's where I was at this morning, we have 
an IOP in Danville. It's not residential. People come in for groups. They come in for counseling, and they 
go back home. 
Ethan (00:46:40): 
But they're kind of working with the team. I mean, they're not out on their own? 
Jason (00:46:43): 
No, they're not on their own. A peer support specialist is under supervision, under clinical supervision with 
a counselor too. So like our notes are all signed off by someone with a license. They're fully aware of, you 
know, like what we're doing on. 
Ethan (00:47:00): 
I don't know all the details, but that's good information to know. 
Jason (00:47:04): 
Yeah. Yeah. So we're not out there just, you know, doing whatever we want to do. 
13 
 
Ethan (00:47:10): 
You couldn't have someone go in for training who doesn't really have a place to take that training to? 
Jason (00:47:17): 
Well, that happens a lot. A lot of people come and get the training in hopes of getting a job somewhere. 
Ethan (00:47:24): 
They can't go out on their own? 
Ethan (00:47:24): 
No, I mean, they can, but they're not going to be able to like set up shop and offer peer support services 
without having an account, without having a clinician. And, you know, there has to be accreditation, AOD, 
and everything like that. So no, they couldn't just go out and just start charging people for peer support 
services. 
Ethan (00:47:51): 
That's good. Well, a couple of other things. So you, I don't know if you do any kind of advocacy work. I 
don't know if you have time for that or if Isaiah House does it sort of in, you know, in other departments, 
where you're just sort of trying to engage the public to inform them about substance use disorder or 
maybe even trying to contact elected officials? I don't know if that, that kind of stuff goes on. 
Jason (00:48:20): 
That happens a lot. A lot of that, Mark LaPalme does a lot of nowadays. He was in Washington DC not long 
ago. He's met with several congressmen and all those highfalutin political people that I don't know nothing 
about. So he does a lot of that, but then we also have a public relations department. And their role is not 
just to put Isaiah House's name out there, but it's also to be an advocate for addiction treatment and 
recovery as a whole. We have, you know, church outreach. We go to churches, and a graduate goes and 
speaks and tells their story, you know. So yeah, there's a lot of that. 
Ethan (00:49:05): 
Okay. You work with certain networks of churches? 
Jason (00:49:09): 
No, not, not, not really a network. We don't like adhere to like a certain denomination or anything like 
that. See that goes back to the cookie cutter thing. Cause you have, you have some good treatment 
programs out there, but they're like denomination specific. Well, what if this person was raised in a 
different denomination. Like you, you know, are you going to be able to reach them? You know what I 
mean? So it goes back to more of that person centered approach, you know. So we don't adhere to a 
particular denomination. 
Ethan (00:49:41): 
So you're careful about that. Do you have like rallies or sort of public events here, where you kind of bring 
people in? 
Jason (00:49:50): 
14 
 
Occasionally, we have things, some fundraisers and things like that. We have one guy who is actually one 
of my peer support specialists. He goes out and sets up a booth every week, at different storefronts. And, 
you know, he talks to people, prays with them. 
Ethan (00:50:08): 
But he also gives information-- 
Jason (00:50:10): 
Yeah. There's information about addiction, recovery, Isaiah House. There's Isaiah House merchandise that 
he, you know, has on hand there. We do fundraisers. We have a golf fundraiser we do every year. I'm 
actually in the process of having our first powerlifting meet this year for recovery. It's still in the works on 
all that. I'm probably going to try to use a gym in Harrodsburg or Danville area. So it will be more 
centralized, rather than people having to drive all the way out here in the middle of nowhere. Appreciate 
you coming out here, by the way. 
Ethan (00:50:48): 
I like it out here. It's nice. 
Jason (00:50:49): 
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, as far as rallies, there's not really-- 
Ethan (00:50:56): 
Yeah, I was just curious. 
Jason (00:50:58): 
There's a lot of those though. And we, we, we maybe have not put a lot of them on or anything, but we 
make our presence known at them. We go and participate in those 
Ethan (00:51:11): 
And really Isaiah house is one of the larger recovery centers. I mean, you draw from all across Kentucky, 
right? 
Jason (00:51:19): 
Yes. And from other states too. Connecticut, Ohio. A few years ago, we had somebody from Canada. 
Ethan (00:51:28): 
Wow. Okay. Well, I thought we'd end by talking sort of about where you see things going, maybe if there's 
any issues that you see that still need to be addressed, maybe things that you think folks need to know 
about. There's a lot there, but you know. 
Jason (00:51:48): 
I think, and I mentioned it earlier. And I'm not a politician, and I'm not a government leader, but coming 
from someone that's on the front lines, someone that's been in the gutter. Their whole way of thinking of 
let's get them, let's--Suboxone is one of the most addictive drugs out there, and it's their answer. Well, 
15 
 
why is it their answer? It's their answer because it gets people back to work, so the tax dollars start coming 
in. You know what I mean? There needs to be more support for long-term treatment. Well, they don't 
want long-term treatment cause there's more, it's more time--it's expensive--but then it's more time that 
they're not getting as much taxes coming in. So more support on real treatment, real treatment, not a 
magic pill right, is very, very much needed. Do I foresee that coming? I hope, but I don't, I don't, I don't 
foresee that. 
Ethan (00:53:05): 
But certainly a need. 
Jason (00:53:05): 
Definitely a need. I just don't know that the government will ever, will ever do that. They, they want the 
short-term treatment. They want the quick, they want the quick fix, like the addict wants it, but it doesn't 
exist. 
Ethan (00:53:19): 
So, so Isaiah House does do any medically assisted-- 
Jason (00:53:23): 
We actually do. We use it in our 28 day facility in Willisburg. We use it for detox. I don't know, like a 7 to 
14 day taper or something. I'm not sure on the specifics of it. I know that we do use it. And then we do 
offer it in our IOP in Danville. And the thing about-- 
Ethan (00:53:49): 
Are there alternatives to Suboxone? 
Jason (00:53:52): 
There is. Vivitrol, there's also Vivitrol. 
Ethan (00:53:54): 
You think that's better? 
Jason (00:53:58): 
Well, it doesn't create a high. Vivitrol doesn't. And I'm not for sure if it's more specific for alcohol than 
opiates, but I think that it's, I think it supposedly works for both. But the thing with Suboxone is it's not in 
itself a bad thing if done correctly. Bring them in, get them to a certain level, make them go to treatment, 
make them go to groups, make them go to counseling, make them participate in recovery, you know. It's 
a difference between a medical assisted treatment and recovery treatment, like it not being about the 
medicine, but the medicine just being a part of the treatment, you know what I'm saying? And having that 
taper down over the course of a year, let's say, but they're being involved in peer support. They're being 
involved in clinical. They're involved in, you know, counseling, one-on-one counseling, you know, that 
they're not just coming in and getting it. And we don't, and that's what we do there. We don't let them 
just come in and get a script, you know. And you get that a lot out there. They have to participate in all 
the functions of recovery. And, and to taper that down, and for it not to be a forever fix. And there 
16 
 
shouldn't be anybody out there two or three, four or five years on Suboxone, because they're still 
dependent. You're still dependent on a substance. 
Ethan (00:55:38): 
Well, then, you also have abuse. 
Jason (00:55:38): 
We get guys come in all the time because they've been abusing Suboxone. You know what I mean? 
Ethan (00:55:46): 
Yeah, something's off there. 
Jason (00:55:50): 
It does make a whole lot of sense, you know. Big pharma and Big Brother. 
Ethan (00:55:54): 
Yeah. They're making money. Yeah. Are there any other issues or, well, let's, let's start with--how do you 
see things going? You know, maybe, maybe they're not gonna switch to the, government's not going to 
switch supporting, you know, real long-term recovery, but what are some other developments you sort 
of see coming? 
Jason (00:56:21): 
As far as the future goes, I really don't know. Like it could go any way. 
Ethan (00:56:27): 
But you've seen a lot of successes, and sort of, in the past six years with the new treatment models? 
Jason (00:56:33): 
I have, with some of the new treatment models. Yeah. I think, I think peer support is, and I'm not saying 
that just because that's what I do. I'm saying that because that's an evidence-based practice that works. 
You know what I'm saying? That'll continue. And I think there needs to be even more emphasis on that. I 
think there needs to be more money made available by the government for peer support services. I mean, 
Medicaid makes it hard to make anything off of it, you know? And that's government, that's government 
insurance. 
Ethan (00:57:08): 
Insurance will also cover--private insurance will also cover some of that? 
Jason (00:57:12): 
No, peer support is Medicaid only. 
Ethan (00:57:16): 
Really, I didn't realize that. 
17 
 
Jason (00:57:18): 
So that would be something, if that changed. You know what I mean? So it would be nice to see the 
government, and they say they are, but then what they do doesn't prove that. It doesn't back that up. You 
don't say peer support, peer support, peer support, and then cut the money in half or however much it 
was, it was a lot. 
Ethan (00:57:41): 
Yeah. Yeah. They did that recently? 
Jason (00:57:43): 
They did that last year. 
Ethan (00:57:45): 
Okay. Is that at the federal level? 
Jason (00:57:47): 
It was just Medicaid. It might've been just Kentucky Medicaid. But it was a lot. It was dramatic. You know, 
how they say it's that important, and then they... But see, this was all during the time when they were 
putting in this push for Suboxone being a part of all treatment. So that would definitely be something that 
I would like to see become more important. I have no problem with Suboxone as, as a detox, as a short-
term aid, a short-term tool, but not being the treatment within itself. 
Ethan (00:58:24): 
That's concerning. 
Jason (00:58:25): 
A lot of places out there do that. It's just about the money. It's just another pill mill. It's all it is. It's just 
another pill mill. 
Ethan (00:58:34): 
Yeah. But how do you see in Kentucky, are people sort of open to more? 
Jason (00:58:40): 
I think it depends on who you're talking to. Most of the recovery communities, not probably, not as open 
to Suboxone, because we've all abused it--or know someone who's abused it. But at the same time, I 
mean, how do I tell some, some mother calling in, you know, that's tried everything in the world and is 
scared to death her son's going to die. And maybe Suboxone will keep him around. How do I tell her that 
it's a bad idea. So it depends on who you talk to. I'm sure the government loves it. You know, more 
taxpayers, more money, you know. So like it depends on who you're talking to. Yeah, big pharma. I'm sure, 
"Let's sell all we can of everything addictive." Cause if they're addicted to it, they're going to keep coming 
back for it, and we're gonna keep making money off of it. 
Ethan (00:59:44): 
18 
 
Yeah. Well, I guess sort of that question about where do you see things going, you know, I mean with, you 
know, the opioid epidemic has been taking a lot of lives and, you know, there's been a lot of attention to 
it. I mean, do you see improvements? Do you see that sort of, you see that sort of dying down? You know, 
sort of taking a really broad view of things. That's kind of our last point there. 
Jason (01:00:17): 
I really don't see it changing. Will it get worse? I don't know that it'll get worse. To me, when I hear the 
word epidemic, I hear something that is short-lived, something that came and happened, and it was big, 
and it was terrible, and it died down. I don't think of this as that. I think this is going to be something we'll 
be dealing with for a very, very long time until scientists find some way to eradicate whatever part of the 
brain that causes addiction. If there is one. Not saying that there is, or there isn't. I don't, I think it's not a 
problem that's just gonna go away. I don't think you can fix it. And I think that creates a need for treatment 
centers. It creates a need for, for evidence-based practices that actually work. 
Ethan (01:01:10): 
So the need will be there, and we'll continue to improve treatment, maybe? 
Jason (01:01:13): 
I think that it will. I believe that it will. Addiction has been a problem as far back as we can go. It was 
alcohol, I mean, thousands of years ago. Opium, it's always been a problem. It always has been. I think 
the thing that's made it really maybe more well known, but maybe a bigger problem was the whole thing 
with the pain pills, with Oxycontin and stuff like that. It was, it started affecting people that it wasn't 
affecting before. And then when they started making the Oxycontin and pain pills and stuff scarce and 
more expensive or harder to get, people started turning the heroin. Well, then most people saw heroin. 
Well, we're finding people with just fentanyl, straight fentanyl, in them. They don't even have heroin. 
They're snorting, shooting straight fentanyl, you know. And so I think it started, what's made it, what's 
making it so prominent now is, was everything with the pain medications. So I don't know. It ain't going 
away. 
Ethan (01:02:40): 
Those drugs are still out there, right? And the, and the folks who you have seen coming in the past few 
years, has it continued to be opioid use disorders? 
Jason (01:02:51): 
There is. A lot, a lot of people on meth, though. Rarely do you get someone that's strictly an alcoholic 
anymore. Very, very uncommon that you get just a straight alcoholic anymore. Usually it's a combination, 
you know, of different things. Opiates and meth, I would say, they're the two biggest that we see. 
Sometimes we have more meth than we do opiates. 
Ethan (01:03:19): 
Yeah. That's kind of recent thing, right? 
Jason (01:03:22): 
Yeah. You know, and it's, you know, it's cheaper. It's easier to get. It's easier to make, you know, so like 
what happens whenever they make that harder to get? They'll just be something else. The problem, the 
19 
 
thing is what I, what I had to learn about my addiction was the drug is not the problem. The alcohol isn't 
the problem. I'm the problem. I can't, I can't, I gotta fix me. If I'm fixing me, I fixed the problem. Well, 
that's all everybody wants to do. They want to focus on the drug. That ain't the problem. The problems in 
the human. That's where it's got to start. That's where the work's gotta be done. Not on trying to find 
some magic pill. And until that starts happening, I don't see it getting better. 
Ethan (01:04:19): 
Well, is there anything else that you'd like to share for posterity? 
Jason (01:04:28): 
No. No. I appreciate the opportunity. 
Ethan (01:04:32): 
Well, thank you for taking time. I'll shut this off. So, we were right at an hour.
