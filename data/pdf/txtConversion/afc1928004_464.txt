Oh ! have you never met will pretty Jessie? 
She's the sweetest girl in town,

Little stars drop from the skies,

The dewdrops are her eyes. 
Oh ! who would dare to crush her,

I'm getting along fast in love, you bet,

To see de fire machine, 
Her hair flew back on de top of her head, 
She looked like a 
Duteh May queen. 
Her dress was white, and her smile was bright, 
Her figure gaunt and lean ; 
She was brigadier gen'ral of a 
market store, 
Sold hammers, turtles and cream. 
I'm going away to leave you,

As sung by R. G. 
LITTLE. 
I've a 
casket at home that is filled with precious gems; 
I 
have pictures of friends d-ar to me, 
And I've trinkets so rar-, thn.t came many years ago, 
From my far distant home across the sea. 
But there's one sweet little treasure that I'll ever dearly 
prise, 
Better far than all the wealth beneath the wave; 
Tho' a 
small faded flow'ret, that I 
placed in childhood's 
days. 
'Tis a 
flower from my angel mother's grave. 
CHORUS. 
Treasured in my mem'ry like a 
happy dream, 
Are the loving words she gave, 
And my heart fondly cleaves to the dry and withered 
leaves— 
'Tis a 
flower from my angel mother's grave. 
In the quiet country churchyard they laid her down 
to sleep ; 
Close beside the old home she's at rest, 
And the low, sacred mound is enshrined within my 
heart, 
By the sweet ties of love forever blest. 
In the still and silent night I 
often dream of home 
again, 
And the vision ever tells me to be brave; 
For the last link that binds me to the place I 
love so 
well, 
Is the flower from my angel mother's grave. 
Treasured in my memory, etc.

SALLY IN OUR ALLEY. 
Composed by HENRY CAREY. 
Music sent postpaid on receipt of io cents by the Popular Pub-
lishing Co., 32 Beekman street, N. Y. 
Of all the girls that are so smart, 
There's none I 
love but Sally, 
She is the darling of my heart, 
And lives in our alley. 
There's not a 
lady in the land 
That's half so sweet as Sally, 
She is the darling of my heart 
And she lives in our alley. 
When she is by, I 
leave my work, 
I 
love her so sincerely ; 
My master comes like any Turk 
And bangs me most severely. 
But let him bang his belly full, 
I'll bear it all for Sally. 
She is the darling of my heart 
And she lives in our alley. 
Of all the days that's in the week, 
I 
dearly love but one day 
And that's the day that comes between 
Saturday and Monday. 
For then I'm drest all in my best 
To walk abroad with Sally; 
She is the darling of my heart 
And bhe liv, 
ia oar alley.

Continued. 
My master carries me to church, 
And often I 
get blamed, 
Because I 
leave him in the lurch 
As soon as the text is named. 
I 
leave the church in sermon time, 
To walk abroad with Sally ; 
She is the darling of my heart 
And she lives in our alley. 
When Christmas comes about again, 
Oh, then I 
shall have money ; 
I'll board it up and box and all, 
And give it to my honey. 
And would it were ten thousand dollars, 
I'd give it all to Sally; 
She is the darling of my heart, 
And she lives in our alley. 
My master and the neighbors all, 
Make game of me and Sally, 
And but for her I'd rather be 
A 
slave, and row a 
galley. 
But when my seven long years are out, 
Oh ! then I'll marry Sally ; 
Oh! then we'll wed, and then we'll bed, 
But not in our alley.

upon de coast, 
De captain and de mate had trouble on de mind, 
De captain and de mate said dey better draw straws, 
So straws were drawn Jonah were casted. 
Janah were casted in the bottom of de whale, 
For three long days and three long nights, 
Jonah; he lay in de bottom of de whale, 
Live humble, live humble, humble yourself to me, sir. 
Glory in de honor, praise King Moses, 
Glory in de honor, bress de lamb. 
Repeat last two lines. 
Now de whale he commanded de Lor's right band, 
To cast brudder Jonak on de innocent land, 
to heave 
brudder Jonah on dry sand; 
And de moon shone down from de promised land, 
Now dat ain't all dere's besides. 
Take a 
little nigger to a 
new burying-ground, 
New burying ground open all de time; 
Dat put a 
frown on Jonah's Crown. 
Live humble, live humble, humble yourself to me, sir; 
Glory in de honor, praise King Moses, 
Glory in de honor, bress de lamb.

To see her taking off a

My wife alone she said she'd be ; 
Yet their vanity she flattered, and their hearts she always shat-

When they tried to play that game on me, you see. 
Her voice filled this darkey full of glee,

LONGING FOR THEM GOOD OLD DAYS AGAIN

To-night I 
am lonely thinking 
Of the happy days that's gone, 
And the dear old spot I 
never more shall see; 
Where around our humble cottage 
The wild flowers sweetly bloomed, 
And the ivy green around the old gum tree.

Oft I 
think I 
see the moonlight 
Beaming in the cabin door. 
And the sad tears my poor old eyes can scarce restraii 
When those scenes raise up before me, 
For Pse old and homeless now, 
And longing for dem good old days again. 
My days am nearly numbered, 
And I 
soon will be at rest; 
No more to hear the laugh of children in the cane; 
The sweet music of their voices 
Through the mists of memory steals, 
And keeps me longing for dem good old days again. 
Oft I 
think, etc. 
I 
am toiling clown the hillside, 
For my youth is past and gone, 
To rest beneath de southern skies again; 
Where my friends they all am sleoping, 
In the old home far away, 
Makes me weary for dem good old days again.

EPIL—My 
gracious, times am bard now. 
Times ain't like

Ebery thing am changed:, I 
am gettin' too 
old to work now, my bones am too weak. 
There's my good 
old wife, Hannah ; if it were not for her I 
don't know what I 
would do. 
The old woman can't last much longer, for she 
works too hard, and if she was to die I 
don't know what I 
should do. (Hannah sings outside.) 
Well, my gracious, dat's 
de old woman comin' down de lane. 
If it were not for dat old 
woman I 
would have died long ago. [Enter AUNT HANNAH.] 
HAN.—Whar you been all mornin ? 
Goodness, you will die 
sure, old man, if you don't eat. 
De breakfus has been waitin' 
for you for de last two hours. 
EPH.—Well, Hannah, if it wasn't for you, I 
don't know what 
old Ephriam would do. 
Hannah, I 
hates to see you workin' so 
hard. 
I 
wish dat I 
was young again ; I 
wish dat I 
was strong 
enough to work. 
But my days are numbered, and dey will soon 
be over. 
HAN.—Cheer up, Ephriam, don't look so downhearted, you 
make me feel bad. 
You must not look so forlorn. 
For while 
Hannah lives you will never want for anything. 
I 
wonld not 
desert you, Ephriam, for I 
am willing to go down on my poor 
old hands and knees and scrub for you. 
When I 
was 
sick 
wasn't it you dat worked and took care of me ? 
No, Ephriam, 
you must cheer up, for there am only us, and while Aunt Han-
nah lives you shall never want for something to eat. 
EPH.—Thank you, Hannah. We am both old now and our 
days are but few. 
Everything am gone.— Poor old missus am

WE 
am getting old and feeble now, we cannot work no more 
We have laid the rusty bladed hoe to rest; 
Old massa and old missus, they're sleeping side by side, 
And their spirits are now roaming with the blest. 
Things are changed about the place, de darkies dey am gone, 
And I 
cannot hear dem singing in de cane, 
And de only one dat's left me is dat good old man of mine, 
In dat little old log cabin in de lane.

We ain't got long around here to remain ; 
But de angels dey will bless us in our happy little home 
In dat little old log cabin in de lane. 
EPH. — There was a 
happy time to me, ' twas many years ago, 
When de darkies used to gather round de door, 
When dey used to dance and sing and I 
played de old banjo, 
But alas I 
cannot play it any more. 
De hinges dey got rusty, and de chimney has fallen down, 
And de roof lets in de sunshine and de rain ; 
Nut de only ftiend dat's left me is dat good old wife of mine, 
In dint little old log cabin in de lane.

And de fences am all going to decay. 
And de creek is all dried up where we used to go to mill, 
De time has turned its course de other way ; 
But we ain't got long to stay and what little time we got, 
We'll try and be contented while we remain,

MY OLD KENTUCKY HOME. 
Music, with Piano Forte Accompaniment, published by J. C. 
Beckel, Philadelphia. 
I 
long, how I 
long, for my home in Kentucky, 
With its fields where I 
labored, so green, 
Where the possum and the coon, and the juicy -wild duck, 
And the 'bacca so prime, I 
have seen ; 
Then I've fished from the banks of the Masella creek, 
And oft, in the shade of the night, 
Have I 
watched with my gun, nigh the old Salt Lick, 
For the game as it come to my sight. 
CHORUS. 
There is my cabin home, 
There is my sisters and brother, 
There is my wife, joy of my life, 
My child, and the grave of my mother. 
That hut, my dear home, my log cabin home, 
With the bench that I 
stood at the dom., 
Where, weary at night, from my work I 
would come, 
And there rest, ere I 
stepped on its floor. 
The calabush vine, that then clung to its walls, 
Oh I 'tis dear in my memory still to me; 
And my master, who lives in his own handsome halls, 
Not so happy as then I 
could be. 
There is, etc. 
But that cabin is far, far away from me now, 
I 
am far from the scenes that I 
love, 
Far away from that wife who once heard me vow 
That forever I 
faithful would prove— 
My friends are still there, and still there is my child, 
And still there, all in life, I 
must crave— 
Still there is that mound, with its flowers so wild, 
Thatscoveis my old mother's grave. 
There is, etc.

THE sun shines bright in the old Kentucky home, 
'Tis summer, the darkies are gay, 
The corn- top's ripe and the meadows in the bloom, 
While the birds make music all the day. 
The young folks roll on the little cabin floor, 
All merry, all happy, and bright; 
By-'n-by hard times comes a-knocking at the door— 
Then my old Kentucky home, good-night. 
CHORUS. 
Weep no more, my lady, 
Oh ! weep no more to- day ; 
We will sing one song for the old Kentucky home, 
For the old Kentucky home, far away. 
They hunt no more for the possum and the coon 
On the meadow, the hill, and the shore ; 
They sing no more by the glimmer of the moon, 
On the beach by the old cabin door. 
The day goes by like a 
shadow o'er the heart, 
With sorrow where all was delight, 
The time has come when the clarkies have to part, 
Then my old Kentucky home good-night. 
-Weep no more, etc. 
The head must bow and the back will have to bend, 
Wherever the darkey may go. 
A

In the field where the sugar canes grow;

No matter, ' twill never be light, 
A

Then my old Kentucky home, gOod-night.
