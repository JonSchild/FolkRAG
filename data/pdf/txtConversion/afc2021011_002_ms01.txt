SPEAKERS
Dale Baumgartner, Jared Schmidt
Jared Schmidt 00:01
All right. It is Friday, March 4, 2022. This is Jared Schmidt with Dale Baumgartner. We are in his
home in Beaver, Oregon, surrounded by a lot of mule deer, elk mounts and everything, which
I'm very impressed by as someone who grew up elk hunting. Before we begin, Dale, I just want
to make sure I have your consent to record this interview.
Dale Baumgartner 00:25
Yes, you do.
Jared Schmidt 00:26
Great. How are we doing today, Dale?
Dale Baumgartner 00:28
Good.
Jared Schmidt 00:28
Good.
Dale Baumgartner 00:29
Very good.

Q 
Jared Schmidt 00:29
Dale is wondering, before we begin, if you wouldn't mind introducing yourself, when you were 
born, what year, your hometown, a little bit about your educational background.
Dale Baumgartner 00:42
Named Dale Baumgartner. I grew up [in] Hebo, Oregon, about four miles from where I'm living 
now. I was born 1951. I grew up on a dairy farm, we had 28 cows and pretty much milked cows 
night and morning until I graduated from my school, and I actually started working for the 
creamery when I was 16.
Jared Schmidt 01:16
Oh, really?
Dale Baumgartner 01:17
Yeah.
Jared Schmidt 01:21
[Making notes] At 16. What did you do with the grammar at 16?
Dale Baumgartner 01:24
Well, you know, back in originally, my dad was on the board of directors for the Hebo Cheese 
Factory, and it was called the Hebo Cheese Association then, and he was part of Tillamook 
Cheese. All the, all the, all the milk came to the factories in milk cans, 10 gallon milk cans.
Jared Schmidt 01:47
The old school?
Dale Baumgartner 01:48
Yeah.
Jared Schmidt 01:48
Ok, really?
D
D
D
D
Dale Baumgartner 01:49
That's all there was back then, you know. And between my junior and senior year of school, I
started working in June of 1968. I started at the Hebo Cheese Factory, making cheese and he
was right there at a point where the farmers were being forced to go Grade A, which at that
time was the milk cans needed to go away and the farmers needed to put bolt tank in...
Jared Schmidt 02:20
Ok.
Dale Baumgartner 02:22
...so that the milk could be cooled in the milk cans. On the farm, the milk cans, you just had a
pit in the milk parlor, a pit that might be, maybe, 10 inches deep...
Jared Schmidt 02:37
Ok.
Dale Baumgartner 02:37
...you'd fill it with cold water and set the milk cans in that.
Jared Schmidt 02:40
Hmm.
Dale Baumgartner 02:40
Well, you know, things were moving, moving along, and it was time for that to go away.
Jared Schmidt 02:48
That doesn't sound very sanitary [laughs].
Dale Baumgartner 02:50
[Laughs] No. Anyway, so that, that was happening right there at that time, and the Hebo
Cheese Factory then shut down in October of '68.
D
D
D
D
D
Cheese Factory then shut down in October of '68.
Jared Schmidt 03:04
Ok.
Dale Baumgartner 03:05
So then I went back, I finished my senior year and then in May, in May of '69, I was, I had my
classes done at the school. So I was actually he's still in school, but I actually was working at
the...It'd be in January, in January of '69, all 13 of the little cheese factories shut down and we
all moved to the Tillamook Plant.
Jared Schmidt 03:35
What year was that again?
Dale Baumgartner 03:36
Huh? January of 1969, all 13 of the plants were shut down and moved, consolidated at the
TIllamook Plant.
Jared Schmidt 03:36
What year did they all shut down again? And were they located all around the county, or...?
Dale Baumgartner 03:52
Every little town had 'em here.
Jared Schmidt 03:53
Ok.
Dale Baumgartner 03:53
You know, like...Hebo, I was at Hebo. Cloverdale had a cheese factory. Beaver had a cheese
factory. Central had a cheese factory, which was halfway between, almost to PC [Pacific City].
Ore Town had a cheese factory.
Jared Schmidt 04:14
D
D
D
D
Jared Schmidt 04:14
Really?
Dale Baumgartner 04:15
Yeah, yeah, there was a Molar, Red Clover. There was just, you know, it's just [chuckle] you
know, the average form was probably, you know, 30, 40 cows at that time, you know, back
then. And then that was a big, that was, you know, to have 30, 40 cows, that was a pretty big
farm you know. And you had the occasional big one, you know, but mean there was nothing
like today.
Jared Schmidt 04:46
Right.
Dale Baumgartner 04:47
Nothing, you know, I mean [laughs], there was no hired men, you were the hired man on the
farm [laughs].
Jared Schmidt 04:54
Because you said you grew up with, what was it, 28 head of cows?
Dale Baumgartner 04:57
Yes.
Jared Schmidt 04:58
So what was your morning like as a, as a kid, I want to back track a little bit.
Dale Baumgartner 05:01
[Dale clears his throat] We were milking at six o'clock in the morning, every morning. You
know, we, you, when you're milking cows, you want to get on to a, a routine.
Jared Schmidt 05:11
Mhm.
D
D
D
D
Dale Baumgartner 05:12
Six o'clock at night, six in the morning. And most of the time I was running to catch the school
bus [laughs].
Jared Schmidt 05:19
Yeah. [Laughs]
Dale Baumgartner 05:19
You know, get done milking, and clean up, and whatnot, and that pretty much...I didn't play
sports in high school because I was milking cows.
Jared Schmidt 05:28
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 05:28
You know?
Jared Schmidt 05:29
Yeah. No time for basketball when there's cows to milk.
Dale Baumgartner 05:32
No, there wasn't, no, uh-uh.
Jared Schmidt 05:34
Okay.
Dale Baumgartner 05:35
No, because, that was, those sports all took place after school hours, you know, and I had to go
home and milk cows [laughs].
Jared Schmidt 05:41
D
D
D
D
D
Yeah, yeah. So then, in Hebo, like, you said, all these little towns had their own cheese factory,
or their own creamery. How much cheese would, you know, like a plant like Hebo make?
Dale Baumgartner 05:53
You know, we were running anywhere from 8 to 10,000 pounds of milk. And, you know...
Jared Schmidt 06:00
A day, or...?
Dale Baumgartner 06:01
A day. You know, I went back to Wisconsin, oh, I got an award back there from the Wisconsin
Cheese Makers Association a couple years ago...
Jared Schmidt 06:19
Ok.
Dale Baumgartner 06:19
...and, you know, for innovation for coming, you know, and I wrote up an article there. You
know, I actually started with the creamery, you know, anywhere from 8 to 10,000 pounds of
milk when I started, and when I finished with 5 million [laughs]
Jared Schmidt 06:42
Just a little different. That's awesome.
Dale Baumgartner 06:46
And you know, I've seen every bit of, I've seen, I've seen every bit of the... [claps hands]. I've
seen every bit of the changes, you know, I've been through six CEOs with the company and,
you know, helped start up three plants. And just pretty much done it all, all the way from. You
know, people don't even realize today, people don't realize that a baby loaf wasn't cut out of a
40 pound block.
Jared Schmidt 07:23
Yeah.
D
D
D
D
Dale Baumgartner 07:24
Baby loaves were made individually. Each individual piece was made.
Jared Schmidt 07:30
Back in the day.
Dale Baumgartner 07:31
Back in the day.
Jared Schmidt 07:32
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 07:33
I've got a hoop here, I'll show you here today.
Jared Schmidt 07:34
Ok, I'm excited, yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 07:36
And and you, I mean, we had our 100th anniversary in 2009.
Jared Schmidt 07:41
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 07:42
And I told the guys there at work, I says, "You know, for the 2009, or, 100th anniversary, I'm
going to make some babies loaf the way we made them back in the '60s and '70s, and that. I
mean, they were just amazed they couldn't hardly believe it how each baby loaf was made. You
know, there was five pound forms, there was three pound wheels, 13 pound wheels, 23 pound
wheels, and all everything was made by hand and waxed and cheese cloth and the whole
works.
D
D
D
D
D
Jared Schmidt 08:16
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 08:16
And boy, they were just amazed.
Jared Schmidt 08:19
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 08:19
I had a, I had a wheel, a 23 pound wheel.
Jared Schmidt 08:26
Mkay.
Dale Baumgartner 08:27
that was still branded, the whole nine yards, and if you had there at at the anniversary, and I
actually gave it to a farmer.
Jared Schmidt 08:36
Aww.
Dale Baumgartner 08:36
And it was still, it was excellent, it was excellent cheese and they ended up eating the whole
thing [slight chuckle].
Jared Schmidt 08:42
[Laughs]
D
D
D
D
Dale Baumgartner 08:43
I was hoping they were gonna save it, you know, preserve it, but I, I do have a, I do have a
three pound wheel here.
Jared Schmidt 08:49
Is the wheel like the mold?
Dale Baumgartner 08:52
A round piece, a round wheel of cheese.
Jared Schmidt 08:55
Ok.
Dale Baumgartner 08:57
Anyway, I have one here. 1988 was the last year we made the wheels. We did any waxing
cheese, wax cheese in uh, 1988. And I've got, I've got one of those wheels from 1988 still.
Jared Schmidt 09:10
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 09:11
All branded and waxed and everything.
Jared Schmidt 09:13
Oh, that's cool.
Dale Baumgartner 09:14
Yeah.
Jared Schmidt 09:15
Oh, the wheel cheese itself that's...
D
D
D
D
D
Dale Baumgartner 09:16
Yes. Oh, it's from 1988, yeah.
Jared Schmidt 09:20
So, I'm a year older than that wheel of cheese.
Dale Baumgartner 09:22
Okay [Laughs]. [Laughs]. There's some context for me. I like it. So you started working at the
Hebo Creamery when you were 16. Yeah.
Jared Schmidt 09:34
How did you learn to make cheese? What was the education process like?
Dale Baumgartner 09:37
You know, you know, you started to bottom like that and you just...what ended up really
happening was I worked there and kind of got introduced into the cheese and then making it.
And then in '69, we went up there to Tilllamook and then you're going along. What happened
was you got 13 cheese factories at all come together in one building.
Jared Schmidt 10:01
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 10:02
Well, you've got 13 bosses, also. [laughs] Well, you know, they, they had picked somebody for
who's going to be the real boss. And Jim, they wanted, they actually picked Jim Golstrum from
the Central Cheese Factory to be the head cheese maker but his wife was dying from cancer at
the time, so he declined it. So they ended up giving it to Ed Yates down there, at the Ore Town
Cheese Factory.
Jared Schmidt 10:39
Ore Town like O-R-E Town?
D
D
D
D
Dale Baumgartner 10:40
Yeah, right. Just before Neskowin.
Jared Schmidt 10:43
Okay, okay.
Dale Baumgartner 10:45
Yeah
Jared Schmidt 10:45
I wasn't sure if that was a pun on OR like Oregon Town or something.
Dale Baumgartner 10:48
Oh, no, no. Anyway, so Ed was a cheesemaker, then, so now you've got, you know the cheese,
you got all, now there's still 12 cheesemakers [laughs] and they've been their bosses for years,
their own bosses in you know. I mean, [laughs] it didn't it, didn't work super good. Because, you
know, you got you, you can't they're all used to working day shift first of all...
Jared Schmidt 11:18
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 11:18
...being the boss and working day shift. And now, while we still need some swing shift people,
we still need some early morning people, you know. Anyway, it just didn't...It really opened the
door for me because, you know, like Morph Worthington from the Beaver Cheese Factory, he
ended up going to ice cream, and then he went to the farm store. Mert Loucks from the
Cloverdale Cheese Factory, he, uh, he stuck around for a while but he went to the farm store.
Hugh Sheldon from the Moeller Cheese Factory up north above, you know, for Moeller, he
ended up going to the whey plant. You know, they just, Jim Golstrum actually, I think Jim
Golstrum was the actual only one that actually stayed the whole time. And, and he actually
retired from the cheese, and he worked early morning and he was the only one. But, we got
into the cheeses all made into we're still making in, we're in the '70s and we're still making
thousands of individual baby loafs every single day.
Jared Schmidt 11:19
D
D
D
D
Ok. Right.
Dale Baumgartner 12:40
We're making wheels, trips and whatnot. And, and we didn't, we made some 40 pounders but
not, not a whole lot. And then, tremendous manual labor, tremendous manual labor.
Jared Schmidt 12:59
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 13:00
And, and it was in 1975, when we actually started messing around with cedar, 40 pounds cedar
that we ended up sealing cheese in 40 pound bag.
Jared Schmidt 13:14
Ok.
Dale Baumgartner 13:15
And in 1975, we started messing around with that a little bit there and testing that out
because, before that, we were hand wrapping the 40 pound block just like a Christmas present
with some really heavy waxed paper.
Jared Schmidt 13:30
Ok.
Dale Baumgartner 13:31
Some real heavy, almost like your butcher paper, only really with a heavy layer of wax on it.
Jared Schmidt 13:38
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 13:39
We'd wrap it just like a Christmas present. And then we had a cooker, that was a size of a 40
D
D
D
D
D
We'd wrap it just like a Christmas present. And then we had a cooker, that was a size of a 40
pound block that a, just like your block on your engine.
Jared Schmidt 13:52
Ok.
Dale Baumgartner 13:54
It was about that thick [makes measurement between thumb and index] only had hot water
running through the center of that jacket.
Jared Schmidt 13:59
So, probably what two and a half inches looks like?
Dale Baumgartner 14:00
It was, it was, it was, it was a couple inches think, anyway. Anyway and you had a door on you
take that wax block of cheese, stick it in there, close the door and leave it in there for, I can't
remember how long we left it in there.
Jared Schmidt 14:14
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 14:14
But it actually melted that wax on that paper...
Jared Schmidt 14:20
Mmm.
Dale Baumgartner 14:20
...and that's how we actually kind of sealed them.
Jared Schmidt 14:22
The mother loafs, then.
D
D
D
D
Dale Baumgartner 14:23
The 40 pound loaf of cheese.
Jared Schmidt 14:25
And then how much does a baby loaf weigh again?
Dale Baumgartner 14:27
A baby loaf is a two pounder.
Jared Schmidt 14:28
Two pounder, ok. And how many of those would you, those mother loaves and baby loves
would you make a day, do you think?
Dale Baumgartner 14:36
Oh, baby loaves...
Jared Schmidt 14:36
This was back in the '70s, you said?
Dale Baumgartner 14:37
Wed, yeah, we'd must have made...Oh, God. I wouldn't be surprised if we made a thousand of
them [laugh].
Jared Schmidt 14:38
A day?
Dale Baumgartner 14:44
Just, oh yeah. Tremendous. Tremendous.
D
D
D
D
D
Jared Schmidt 14:48
And what was the distribution range of the creamery at that point? Like what you said the
1970s?
Dale Baumgartner 14:53
Pretty much just the Northwest.
Jared Schmidt 14:55
Just the Northwest.
Dale Baumgartner 14:55
We, we were just pretty much the Northwest. Yeah.
Jared Schmidt 14:58
Ok.
Dale Baumgartner 14:58
And you know, we we didn't, back then, pretty everything was pretty much just medium
cheese.
Jared Schmidt 15:06
Ok.
Dale Baumgartner 15:06
We, we did, you know, it wasn't, it had to have been, it had to have been into the mid '80s or
something when we started doing a bunch of black wax. And that was some cheese that was
older, you know, maybe a year year and a half old black, what we called Black Wax.
Jared Schmidt 15:27
Ok.
Dale Baumgartner 15:27
D
D
D
D
D
Dale Baumgartner 15:27
And it was cut out of a 40 pounder and wrapped in cellophane
Jared Schmidt 15:32
Mhm
Dale Baumgartner 15:32
and then dipped in black wax, and we called it the Black Wax.
Jared Schmidt 15:36
Oh, ok.
Dale Baumgartner 15:36
And then that was what we called our sharp cheese but we didn't get into the, we didn't push
into the real aged market. The creamery made a decision in 1994 that we were going to go into
the, we were going to hit the aged cheese market big time. And we really started putting
cheese back away for real aging.
Jared Schmidt 16:01
Before that it was just medium cheddar, right?
Dale Baumgartner 16:04
Pretty much just medium cheddar, yeah.
Jared Schmidt 16:06
Is that what we have one of them here? [Jared points to one of the cheeses Dale has prepared
for him to try] Yeah, that's medium right there. That's the medium.
Dale Baumgartner 16:16
Yeah.
Jared Schmidt 16:17
D
D
D
D
D
Jared Schmidt 16:17
What makes, I've heard it explained that it's just, what defines a medium versus sharp is, is
time, is age. Is that what it is?
Dale Baumgartner 16:18
It is, it is, pretty much. Yes it, yes. Yeah.
Jared Schmidt 16:19
[Jared takes a bite of medium cheddar] That's always so good.
Dale Baumgartner 16:23
Yeah.
Jared Schmidt 16:23
So how old is or how long is medium cheddar aged for?
Dale Baumgartner 16:27
We don't, Tillamook is a raw raw milk cheese. We we heat shock our cheese only on cheddar
and so we do we do both I guess. But do, they, we do pasteurize some, too, but... It's pretty
much, our medium cheddar is heat shocked. So by law, you have to hold it 60 days
Jared Schmidt 16:56
Ok.
Dale Baumgartner 16:56
before you can actually cut it and send it to market. And, so this is, so our medium, Tillamook
medium cheddar cheese is going to be at least 60 days old.
Jared Schmidt 17:06
Okay, and they store it in like a cool facility or...
Dale Baumgartner 17:09
Correct.
D
D
D
D
D
Correct.
Jared Schmidt 17:10
Ok.
Dale Baumgartner 17:10
Yep, yep, yep.
Jared Schmidt 17:11
Ok. With the fancy robot you all have now...
Dale Baumgartner 17:14
Yep, yep. Yeah [both laugh].
Jared Schmidt 17:16
I've heard tale of the robot the, the...
Dale Baumgartner 17:18
Oh, the ASRS. Oh yeah, that's, well, when you got into that aged cheese market, you know,
now you got to set cheese, you got to set millions and millions of pounds of cheese back. So
you got to have a storage facility, you know, it took a big...The first storage facility was like 10
million pounds and then we ended up, by, doing the robot, you know? And yeah.
Jared Schmidt 17:43
Yeah. And this is, which color label is the medium that's the the red label or is that the...
Dale Baumgartner 17:49
No, that's the normal, that's the normal, hang on...[walks to kitchen and grabs baby loaf of
cheddar in wrapping from his refridgerator]
Jared Schmidt 18:06
Oh, that one? Yeah, the normal...
D
D
D
D
Oh, that one? Yeah, the normal...
Dale Baumgartner 18:07
This is a normal two pound loaf.
Jared Schmidt 18:09
The one that we have in our fridge right now [laughs].
Dale Baumgartner 18:12
You know, like the Bandon...You know, Tillamook also makes the Bandon cheese.
Jared Schmidt 18:17
Mhm, yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 18:18
Well that, the Bandon cheese is actually fully pasteurized and it is actually fully pasteurized and
actually we can market it right away.
Jared Schmidt 18:26
Okay, Bandon, they make the Vampire Slayer garlic cheese, is that the one I'm thinking of? Or
is that a different creamery? Maybe a different one?
Dale Baumgartner 18:34
Must be.
Jared Schmidt 18:35
Okay could be. So that's the orange the cheddar looking label is the medium cheddar?
Dale Baumgartner 18:40
Yeah right.
D
D
D
D
D
Jared Schmidt 18:42
Ok.
Dale Baumgartner 18:43
The red is what they call sharp, and then you got your black, your extra sharp.
Jared Schmidt 18:49
Ok. And how long are those aged for?
Dale Baumgartner 18:53
I think the extra sharp is 15 months.
Jared Schmidt 18:56
Ok.
Dale Baumgartner 18:56
The nine months, I believe, on the red one.
Jared Schmidt 18:59
Okay, what makes it when you age a long was it, what makes the process making it age, or
making it taste different? Or what what happens in that process?
Dale Baumgartner 19:10
You know, what we ended up doing...You know we have a tremendous grading century lab
there in Tillamook.
Jared Schmidt 19:21
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 19:22
And we actually created that I believe in 19, I think it was 1994 when we started the century
D
D
D
D
D
lab and to grade the cheese. Before that, the field man, back in the '70s and '80s, our field man
that worked with the farmers was was also the cheese grader.
Jared Schmidt 19:42
Okay.
Dale Baumgartner 19:44
So he would come in and, you know we, we make a vat of cheese and you save out samples
and these go to the lab for you know salt, fat, moisture, all the analysis and bacteria in the
works. And they would grade it, and, you know, back in the '70s and '80s there was either B
Grade, or it was good.
Jared Schmidt 20:09
Yeah, ok.
Dale Baumgartner 20:09
There was two grades [both laugh]. Well, then, when we started the century lab, then we got
into a lot more, you know, like now, they'll wait til 60 days old, bring the samples in, plug them,
smell it, you know, taste taste everyone, every every everyone. And, you know, if there's, if
there's some signs and maybe a little bit of off flavors or something, then it needs to go to
medium.
Jared Schmidt 20:25
Ok.
Dale Baumgartner 20:36
If there's just something there you want to just set cheese back to age like this, you want it
pretty much almost perfect at, at 60 days, you want to pretty you know, there's not much for
off flavors or any of that. Yeah, we can set it back for aging.
Jared Schmidt 21:05
Ok.
Dale Baumgartner 21:05
D
D
D
D
And then it just depends on how much sharp they need or how much extra sharp or whatever
you own. You pick, uh, sales kind of depict that.
Jared Schmidt 21:14
Right. Okay.
Dale Baumgartner 21:15
So, but it...[laughs] it gets, it gets pretty detailed, actually, you know.
Jared Schmidt 21:23
Right. I can believe that. Yeah, yeah. So but so, and beginning, and so you were making this
medium cheddar at the Creamery exclusively until '94? Is that what it was?
Dale Baumgartner 21:35
Well, I mean, we had some cheese that got set back for the Black Wax program... ...but it
wasn't until '94, we had, the creamy decided that they're going to get big time into the sharp
market and we're going to really take over the sharp market here in America and and really get
into it and, you know...I think Tillamook had an upper hand there to begin with because, you
know, our farmers here, the farmers here in Tillamook, you know they, they recognize the value
of quality milk, and our milk here in Tillamook was just absolutely the best. I mean, I think just
about anybody in the country would have told you that, boy, you know, I wish we had the milk
that they have up there in Tillamook.
Jared Schmidt 21:39
Right, ok. Yeah. What makes it so special do you think, or so good?
Dale Baumgartner 22:00
Well, I mean, it's just a matter of cleanliness and, you know, taking care of your cows and uh,
Jared Schmidt 22:04
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 22:05
the whole nine yards there, and...the milk was just, it's just high quality here. It's just absolutely
D
D
D
D
the whole nine yards there, and...the milk was just, it's just high quality here. It's just absolutely
super high quality, it was and and it made it, uh...It just makes it, it makes a good for the
cheese maker to make good cheese [Jared and Dale both laugh]. Yeah.
Jared Schmidt 22:50
It makes your life easier, right?
Dale Baumgartner 22:51
Yeah, I mean, we had Dairy Gold up in Sunnyside, Washington. They're playing up there in
Sunnyside, Washington, you know, they came down here and seen, our visitor center, and "Oh,
man! Oh, we're going to give Tillamook some competition."
Jared Schmidt 23:08
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 23:08
And, you know, I mean, that had to be in back in the '90s, or somewhere in the 90s. And then,
and they, they built in fact, actually they had the, they had the ASRS robot before us.
Jared Schmidt 23:23
Oh, okay.
Dale Baumgartner 23:23
We actually went up there and looked at theirs before we bought ours [Jared and Dale both
laugh]. Anyway, they put in a big visitor center and everything and they were gonna make
sharp cheese and they're gonna run Tillamook right out of the market. And uh, their quality of
milk wasn't good enough. And they, they didn't [ha]. They didn't hurt us at all.
Jared Schmidt 23:43
Spoiler alert - it didn't work, right?
Dale Baumgartner 23:44
[Dale laughs] It didn't work.
D
D
D
D
Jared Schmidt 23:45
[Laughs]
Dale Baumgartner 23:46
But, you know, we even, even when we decided to, when we knew...In the late '90, we knew
that we couldn't, we knew the Tillamook plant couldn't meet the market demand anymore.
Jared Schmidt 24:02
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 24:02
And so we, we had to do something. We had to do something to...we either got to start taking
shortcuts
Jared Schmidt 24:10
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 24:13
and kind of losing the quality, or we had to build a plant or find a plan, you know.
Jared Schmidt 24:18
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 24:18
And we the, I think there was like six, there were six or eight board members that were on the
committee and I was on there because I was cheesemakers at the time and we just, you know,
we're not going to take any shortcuts.
Jared Schmidt 24:37
Right.
D
D
D
D
Dale Baumgartner 24:38
We're going to keep the quality, quality's gonna be number one, and we're going to do
something else, and... And, you know, at that point, we knew we're going to build a built a plant
or something, somewhere and, you know, we, we had a whole bunch of, you know, Klamath
Falls was on the radar. Orland, California, was on the radar. Baker, uh, Baker, uh, Napa, Idaho,
the plant there was a plant in Nappa, Idaho, and uh, Blackfoot, Idaho
Jared Schmidt 24:38
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 24:49
There was a plant called Snake River Cheese at that time. And I went over there and spent like
a couple of weeks in Idaho Falls, and then went to the Snake River Plant and took inventory of
all their equipment, and what we could do there you know, what, what it would be capable of.
You know, we went to Orland, California, looked at the plant down there, see what that was
capable of. I went to the Napa plant with Swiss Village Cheese there in Napa and spent some
time there at that plant seeing what, you know. And, you know, we didn't only just go there, we
actually had milk from Orland, California shipped up to Tillamook.
Jared Schmidt 25:56
Okay.
Dale Baumgartner 25:56
We had cheese from Idaho, or milk from Idaho shipped to Tillamook.
Jared Schmidt 26:01
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 26:01
And we actually made cheese out of this milk Anyway, and that, that's the way it worked out,
and, you know, we ended up, we ended up going to Boardman ,you know. We ended up going
out and, we didn't buy a used plant, we just decided we're going to break ground and build a
plant in Boardman, you know. And there wasn't a single milking cow in Morrow County when we
broke ground for that plant.
Jared Schmidt 26:03
D
D
D
D
Jared Schmidt 26:03
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 26:04
and kept it separate so we could actually, you know, we could actually graded it 60 days in
accuracy, what we had for...
Jared Schmidt 26:11
Right.
Dale Baumgartner 26:11
It's called Glambia, now. They changed your name to Glambia, their an Irish company. And we
actually took our stirred curd production there, our Monterrey, and Pepper Jack, and Cojack.
And we actually, by taking that out of the Tillamook plant, and taking it over there, we could
actually free up a lot of space for more Tillamook cheese to be made at Tillamook. You know,
what's their milk quality and whatnot.
Jared Schmidt 26:14
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 26:14
So I mean, you know, everything moves slow at Tillamook.
Jared Schmidt 26:19
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 26:19
You know, that's one of the things that just drove, I think all the salesmen and that just crazy
[Jared laughs]. Everything just moves so slow. But they just didn't realize that, you know, we
make cheese today, we're not gonna look at it again for 60 days.
Jared Schmidt 26:31
Mhm.
D
D
D
D
Dale Baumgartner 26:33
And so, if you test a bag out, or test something out, we're not even gonna look at it for another
60 days, and then, you know, they want to sell today not tomorrow [Laughs]
Jared Schmidt 27:00
Right. Okay, okay.
Dale Baumgartner 27:05
And that was a big deal. And, you know, in the meantime, we can't, we can't meet our
demands.
Jared Schmidt 27:14
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 27:14
We still got some time before the plant comes on in Boardman, so we ended up, we ended up.
We don't, we don't want to give up our recipe for Tillamook cheddar cheese. So we actually, at,
I believe it was '90...I believe it was '98 when we went to Twin Falls, Idaho he was it was called
Avenmore West at that time. Okay. So is, today,the pepper jack is made an Idaho, is that? No,
no.
Jared Schmidt 28:07
Okay.
Dale Baumgartner 28:08
It was, it was was made in Idaho from 1998 to 2001.
Jared Schmidt 28:27
Okay, so pepper jack cheese that's currently in my fridge was made in Tillamook.
Dale Baumgartner 28:31
Oh, that's, that's made in the Boardman plant.
D
D
D
D
D
Oh, that's, that's made in the Boardman plant.
Jared Schmidt 28:33
Boardman plant, okay, making sure. It's nice to know,it's nice to know where your food comes
from, right?
Dale Baumgartner 28:38
Yes, right, right. But we couldn't, we just needed some, we needed to go somewhere...We
didn't want to give anybody our cheddar cheese recipe.
Jared Schmidt 28:49
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 28:50
So we, we just felt it best. Our best chance for survival was to take our stirred curd and
because, you know, you can sign all the agreements you want but there's also a way around it.
You know? We went to Glambia and we're making our cheese there, yo and next thing you
know, they're making cheese for, their making cheese for somebody else. Well, it's higher
moisture. They got around it so easy it wasn't funny.
Jared Schmidt 29:21
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 29:22
And, you know, we ended up down at Crescent City, California, with Romianos. We ended up
making a bunch of cheese down there, also, at Romianos, down there and we actually ended
up, we actually ended up at Sunnyside in Dairy Gold. We actually ended up making some
cheese up there at Sunnyside plant also...
Jared Schmidt 29:47
Mkay.
Dale Baumgartner 29:47
...waiting for that, the Boardman plant, the Boardman one, to come online.
D
D
D
D
Jared Schmidt 29:53
Mkay.
Dale Baumgartner 29:53
And then we bought it online in July of 2001. And then I think it was in late October of 2001,
when we brought all of our outside production, we brought it all back home.
Jared Schmidt 30:08
Okay, and that was 2001 you said?
Dale Baumgartner 30:10
Yes, late-October 2001.
Jared Schmidt 30:15
Everything was brought back?
Dale Baumgartner 30:16
Yes.
Jared Schmidt 30:18
Okay, making sure. Okay. Quite the journey there's all this cheese is just having with...I think
what always surprises me is how complicated something so like, you know, quote unquote
simple as cheese is. They think everyone just [Dale laughs in background] thinks. "Oh, it's just
cheese." But, like, no there's so much more to it than just milk equals cheddar, right? There's
so much more.
Dale Baumgartner 30:45
Yeah, it's been a, been a tremendous journey for me and a tremendous journey for me anyway.
Jared Schmidt 30:50
Yeah.
D
D
D
D
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 30:50
Coming all the way, you know, just, you know, we...Even in Tillamook we had, everything was
made by hand up until 1990, May of 1990.
Jared Schmidt 31:06
Ok.
Dale Baumgartner 31:07
You know, we made, you're making all the cheese in open tables, you have open cooking vats,
you have open tables, it's all manual labor, you know, you're hanging over the vat, you're
losing sweat into the cheese. People are watching you right there at the windows, they're like
three feet away from the windows, there at Tillamook at the time, in the '80s, you know, and
production is growing. I think at the time we were growing like at 13% a year, you know, it's
just hard to keep up.
Jared Schmidt 31:38
Right.
Dale Baumgartner 31:39
And you realize that we've got to do something. And...I'm gonna say it was 1988 when we
realized we got to do something.
Jared Schmidt 31:51
Ok.
Dale Baumgartner 31:52
And the decision was to put in a cheddar, a cheddaring machine, an automated cheddaring
machine. And Ed Yates and I flew back to Iowa, and we looked at a plant back there that had to
one of these machines and New Zealand is, back then New Zealand was just kind of the...they
were at the top cheese equipment manufacturing world, you know. They were the, they were
the kind of the kings, there, they were their technology was just ahead of most places, you
know. So uh, we had a cheddaring machine made down there in New Zealand and it came up
D
D
D
D
here and, uh, it must have showed up in, maybe right there at the very beginning of 1990. And
you know [clears throat], we have all these farmers out here...now Tillamook is going to
automated equipment.
Jared Schmidt 33:01
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 33:01
Oh man. I think if you would have asked just about anybody in Tillamook County back in, before
we started up that cheddaring machine, they would have said that Tillamook's gonna to sink
here in just a few months.
Jared Schmidt 33:13
Really?
Dale Baumgartner 33:13
Yeah, there was very little confidence, there's very little confidence in the machine.
Jared Schmidt 33:20
Hmm.
Dale Baumgartner 33:20
It was a real lot of negative, negativity here in Tillamook County over this, this automated
equipment that we're going to put in, cheese is just gonna go to heck and we're going to be
done.
Jared Schmidt 33:31
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 33:31
And you know, I mean...1990 was probably [laughs] 1990, 1991, were probably two of my worst
years...
D
D
D
D
Jared Schmidt 33:42
Really?
Dale Baumgartner 33:42
...as far as stress and and putting in hours of just, you know, hours and hours and hours. You
know, we got this cheddaring machine in, and we built it right on, the vaulted room that we're
in right now, you know that, up here in Tillamook. But, we built that on, now...The machine was
shipped from New Zealand and a couple guys from New Zealand came up with it and, uh, me
and Butch [Ciphered] and Ed Yates, we helped put the machine together and...
Jared Schmidt 34:18
Which is no, that's a big machine.
Dale Baumgartner 34:20
[In exapserated note] Oh, huge. Anyway, you know, I was fortunate enough to get to put this
machine together and understand how it works and the whole nine yards, you know, and we
know. We went to fire it upthere in May of 1990. Well, our treatment plant couldn't handle
the...we couldn't run both plants. We were trying to run a little bit of cheese in the new plant
and run the old plant full bore.
Jared Schmidt 34:52
Right.
Dale Baumgartner 34:52
And just couldn't keep up, couldn't keep up with it. We had to make the decision we've got,
we've either got to...We've either got to say to heck with the equipment or we got to, you
know. So we ended up shutting the other plant down, just going out to the big plant, the new
plant and that automated equipment. And boy, I tell ya, we just, you know you're working out
[clears throat]...We ended up, we ended up going out there, running for a while, and then we
went back to the other plant back and forth. Because we found, you know, we got to fix this, we
got to do this, we had to put some more runners under the belt. We just had to do...We just
fought it for a good year and a half.
Jared Schmidt 35:35
Yeah.
D
D
D
Dale Baumgartner 35:36
We fought it for a good year and a half, we made a huge amount of adjustments to it. There
was time, there was a there was probably a month or so where we had to go in and readjust
the belt every single night after run, and you know, take you several hours and then we finally
figured out we had to put some pins in there to keep the sprockets from moving. And just
things like that. And you know, um, I'm going to say by 1992...
Jared Schmidt 36:07
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 36:07
...by 1992, we probably had mostly bugs worked out.
Jared Schmidt 36:10
Ok.
Dale Baumgartner 36:10
And uh, then we decided, well now we're going to, now we're going to try running stirred curd
[Jared laughs], you know, or Monterey and that. And I think this was actually one of the first
machines here in Tillamook that actually ran stirred curd...
Jared Schmidt 36:23
Ok.
Dale Baumgartner 36:24
...on and we figured it out. And, you know, I think, we ended up proving all them doubters
wrong. But it took us almost two years to do it.
Jared Schmidt 36:36
Right.
Dale Baumgartner 36:36
And, and by making a lot of adjustments to the machine and whatnot. And we actually, I think
D
D
D
D
D
And, and by making a lot of adjustments to the machine and whatnot. And we actually, I think
we actually, we made the...we ended up making the product much more consistent, is what we
ended up, in the end.
Jared Schmidt 36:49
Okay.
Dale Baumgartner 36:49
Because we ended up making a much more consistent product
Jared Schmidt 36:52
Right.
Dale Baumgartner 36:53
versus what we did on the open tables and you open vats.
Jared Schmidt 36:56
Yeah, I mean, the proof is literally on our, on the table.
Dale Baumgartner 36:58
Oh yes, yes.
Jared Schmidt 36:59
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 37:00
In fact, here, you know, this cheese here [points at an aged whited cheddar] is 17 years old.
Jared Schmidt 37:03
Yeah, I was gonna ask you if you could explain what we have, the spread you set out for me.
D
D
D
D
Dale Baumgartner 37:08
This is some white cheddar that's seventeen-years-old,
Jared Schmidt 37:12
Wow.
Dale Baumgartner 37:12
from 2005. And you know, here in America, I mean, this is probably...
Jared Schmidt 37:19
[Eating the aged white cheddar] Oh, that's divine.
Dale Baumgartner 37:21
...this, this cheese is probably worth anywhere from $50 to $100 a pound.
Jared Schmidt 37:27
Really?
Dale Baumgartner 37:27
Easy, easy! Easy $to $100 a pound, believe me.
Jared Schmidt 37:33
The crystals in that, just, it pops.
Dale Baumgartner 37:35
It's got the crystals and what not. It, you know, there, if you went out here to the Krafts,or the
Dairy Golds, or Sargento, or any of these, and you told me that you've got some seventeen-
year-old cheese that's absolutely excellent. They wouldn't hardly, I, they wouldn't hardly
believe you, probably.
Jared Schmidt 37:56
D
D
D
D
D
Jared Schmidt 37:56
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 37:56
Probably until they tasted it. But this is seventeen-year-old cheese that has aged out into 40
pound block that is absolutely phenomenal.
Jared Schmidt 38:05
Well I'm very fortunate to try that.
Dale Baumgartner 38:07
Oh, it's worth a fortune, believe me [Laughs].
Jared Schmidt 38:12
[Eating cheese Dale put on table] So if you explain, so this one was, was set aside for
seventeen years, and then just left to age, and then...
Dale Baumgartner 38:20
That's actually, that was, that's actually out of my private stash [Laughs].
Jared Schmidt 38:26
Well, thank you, Dale. I really appreciate it.
Dale Baumgartner 38:27
[Laughs]
Jared Schmidt 38:27
I, like you said, you can just feel...For the listeners at home, you can just feel the crystals just
Dale Baumgartner 38:35
Oh yeah.
D
D
D
D
D
Jared Schmidt 38:35
back of your teeth, it kind of pops, not unlike...
Dale Baumgartner 38:38
You know, for, for say. You know, I don't, I don't drink, or smoke, or don't drink coffee, or any of
that stuff, but, for someone that loved wine and cheese.
Jared Schmidt 38:52
Oh.
Dale Baumgartner 38:53
They would pay a million for this [Laughs]
Jared Schmidt 38:56
My mind is thinking that with a Cabernet Sauvignon would just be like chef's kiss.
Dale Baumgartner 39:01
Yeah.
Jared Schmidt 39:03
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 39:04
Yeah, yeah.
Jared Schmidt 39:05
It's got, like, romantic St. Valentine's Day written all over it on that one.
Dale Baumgartner 39:08
[Laughs] Yeah.
D
D
D
D
D
[Laughs] Yeah.
Jared Schmidt 39:10
Super good. Yeah, you said, you brought up with the crystals, right?
Dale Baumgartner 39:14
Yeah.
Jared Schmidt 39:14
What makes that crystaline happen? What, what made, what's going on with that cheese?
Dale Baumgartner 39:19
It comes with age.
Jared Schmidt 39:20
It comes with age.
Dale Baumgartner 39:21
Yes, yes, it gets crystally. In fact, it doesn't, you see how crumbly it is?
Jared Schmidt 39:29
Mhm, yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 39:31
As cheese ages, you can't, you can't cut it like this anymore.
Jared Schmidt 39:36
Okay, I gotta take a picture of it before, before I eat it all.
Dale Baumgartner 39:38
D
D
D
D
D
[Laughs]
Jared Schmidt 39:42
Okay, yeah, it gets crumbly with, with age because of the crystals, or?
Dale Baumgartner 39:47
It's like if you took...as it ages, you can't cut it, it just falls apart.
Jared Schmidt 39:54
Okay.
Dale Baumgartner 39:54
The moisture...You know that's one of the things with Tillamook cheese. That's another one,
you know that um, you know, I don't know, I don't know how much I want to say about the
recipe, you know.
Jared Schmidt 40:06
Right.
Dale Baumgartner 40:08
[Clears throat] I've got the recipe seen the gun safe [laughs]
Jared Schmidt 40:11
Right behind me, right beneath [ILL] beneath the antelope and the mountain goat. I like that,
like little sentry guards.
Dale Baumgartner 40:17
Yeah. [Jared laughs] But you know, the you know, you can't just take a piece of cheese and age
it and have it turn out to be good cheese.
Jared Schmidt 40:27
Okay.
D
D
D
D
Okay.
Dale Baumgartner 40:28
You know, you have to do things to get it, you have to do things with the moisture and whatnot
to get it to age.
Jared Schmidt 40:34
Okay, like, like what?
Dale Baumgartner 40:36
So, you mean, you know, this, this medium loaf of cheese, here, is going to have higher
moisture than that, that cheese there.
Jared Schmidt 40:45
Okay.
Dale Baumgartner 40:46
You know,
Jared Schmidt 40:47
we leave that as almost old enough to vote.
Dale Baumgartner 40:49
You know, we, we, we [clears throat] when I was still there, working, you know, you'd, you'd be
working while we were making pretty much aged...We were making pretty much aged cheddar
every single day in Tillamook.
Jared Schmidt 41:01
Okay.
Dale Baumgartner 41:03
And we were making pretty much all of our medium at the Bordeman One plant.
D
D
D
D
D
Jared Schmidt 41:07
Okay.
Dale Baumgartner 41:09
And, and we're intentionally we're intionally running the moisture up higher on the, on the
medium cheddar cheese.
Jared Schmidt 41:17
Mkay.
Dale Baumgartner 41:19
You know, money's water, or water's money.
Jared Schmidt 41:22
Water's money, yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 41:23
Water's money you know, I mean...You know, if you're not gonna, if you're not gonna age it,
you can run the moisture up a little bit higher, say a percent higher
Jared Schmidt 41:33
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 41:34
And, and sell a little bit of water and still have good cheese.
Jared Schmidt 41:38
Mhm.
D
D
D
D
Dale Baumgartner 41:39
You know, that's one of the things that I think Tillamook needs to be be extremely proud of is
that, you know, we've never...[Clears throat] I stayed up with technology all the time, but,
trying different things out that, you know, the industry was doing.
Jared Schmidt 41:55
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 41:56
You know, like uh, uh flavor enhancers to try to get cheese to , a 60-year-old piece of cheese to
taste like a six or eight month old piece of cheese.
Jared Schmidt 42:07
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 42:08
And, and, you know, we had an open, we had an open vat there in Tillamook, an open table and
we could make cheese here. And we did make cheese here, we made our curd, cheese curds
there for retail.
Jared Schmidt 42:21
Right.
Dale Baumgartner 42:22
And, and I would mess around with that just to see, so you knew what, you know, you wanted
to be up on technology and you want to. And, and we pretty much, pretty much proved to
ourselves that you can use flavor enhancers, but you can't
Jared Schmidt 42:38
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 42:38
[tapping on table in cadence with the words in this sentence] you can't compete with
Tillamook's actual natural aging.
D
D
D
D
D
Tillamook's actual natural aging.
Jared Schmidt 42:43
Right.
Dale Baumgartner 42:43
It just didn't work.
Jared Schmidt 42:44
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 42:45
Tere, there was no comparison. But I, you know, I stayed up on that stuff all the time, different
things like that, that were going on out in the industry. And, and, it just, it just never worked
out. It never worked out for us that way.
Jared Schmidt 42:59
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 43:00
We pretty much proved ourselves
Jared Schmidt 43:02
Right.
Dale Baumgartner 43:02
to ourselves, which was good. We wanted, to we wanted to, you know, this is just naturally
aged cheese, whole milk just naturally aged. And uh
Jared Schmidt 43:10
Yeah.
D
D
D
D
Dale Baumgartner 43:10
there's not a lot of people doing that out there anymore.
Jared Schmidt 43:13
Okay. So what we are, we're having is just the chemistry of it working out not like, you're not
injecting it with anything that's...
Dale Baumgartner 43:19
Nope, nope, nope, absolutely nothing.
Jared Schmidt 43:21
Okay.
Dale Baumgartner 43:21
You know, it's naturally aged. You know, it comes all the way down to, [clears throat, chuckles]
all the way down to the cheese bags, even, the forty pound cheese bags.
Jared Schmidt 43:33
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 43:34
We, we tried, I wont go into detail, but. [Jared laughs] We tried...
Jared Schmidt 43:40
You're more than welcome to.
Dale Baumgartner 43:42
Well, I don't know how much we want to, you know...
Jared Schmidt 43:44
D
D
D
D
D
Jared Schmidt 43:44
How much you can share?
Dale Baumgartner 43:45
Yeah, yeah, I don't know.
Jared Schmidt 43:46
That's fine.
Dale Baumgartner 43:47
I mean, I could but I don't, I don't know if I really wanna because I've actually thought about a
book.
Jared Schmidt 43:52
Mkay.
Dale Baumgartner 43:53
I've actually got a lot of notes down myself. My cousin is actually, he wrote, he just got through
writing a book and [clears throat] but...We've tried different cheese bags out there on the
market, made a different material and actually proved to ourselves that you can use bags of
certain material
Jared Schmidt 44:11
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 44:12
and you cannot age cheese
Jared Schmidt 44:13
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 44:15
D
D
D
D
D
in them bags like you can certain bags.
Jared Schmidt 44:17
Hmm.
Dale Baumgartner 44:18
And so we actually use a specific bag, there, to age our cheese out [clears throat] for full
length, you know. And it's just, there's just so much to it, it, it's amazing how much, it's just not
making a piece of cheese and throw it in a bag and throw it in your refrigerator.
Jared Schmidt 44:40
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 44:40
You know, even, even, even [clears throat] you can go down to the grocery store and you can
buy a whole bunch of two pound baby loaf...
Jared Schmidt 44:49
Right
Dale Baumgartner 44:50
...and throw it in your refrigerator and leave it for five years.
Jared Schmidt 44:55
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 44:56
And if I had, at the same time, I had a a 40 pound block of cheese that was setting right beside
it in the refrigerator...
Jared Schmidt 45:06
Mhm.
D
D
D
D
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 45:07
...that 40 pound block of cheese is going to age out much better than that two pound baby loaf.
Jared Schmidt 45:13
Really?
Dale Baumgartner 45:13
Absolutely.
Jared Schmidt 45:14
Why's that?
Dale Baumgartner 45:15
It's just, you have more cheese and more enzymes and the whole thing working together.
Jared Schmidt 45:23
More mass, kind of...
Dale Baumgartner 45:23
Yes, yes. Yeah, so it, a 40 pound block of cheese is gonna, [pointing at the aged white cheddar]
this was cut out of a 40 pound block of cheese here.
Jared Schmidt 45:31
The seventeen-year-old one.
Dale Baumgartner 45:31
This was this was cut...I cut up a 40 pound block here just, it hadn't been probably, less than a
month ago.
D
D
D
D
D
Jared Schmidt 45:40
Well, I'm very flattered that you shared that with me, that...
Dale Baumgartner 45:42
I had, I had a 2007 block I'd been working on before that. But, [clears throat] yeah. To go out
on the market and try to find something like this are probably going to be next to impossible.
And if you are, I see, I've seen, I've seen cheese like this
Jared Schmidt 45:57
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 45:57
back in Wisconsin advertised for $100 an ounce. $100 an ounce. You're eating money there
[laughs].
Jared Schmidt 46:06
I am. Well, thank you for sharing your money with me, I appreciate it [Dale laughs]. I will, I will
savour your money, there, Dale.
Dale Baumgartner 46:12
No it is, it's almost impossible to get.
Jared Schmidt 46:16
Well, it's, it's divine. It's, seriously.
Dale Baumgartner 46:18
Yeah.
Jared Schmidt 46:18
Like that's critical. And I come from, I'm moving, coming here from Wisconsin. Yeah, I can I can
believe that.
D
D
D
D
Dale Baumgartner 46:25
Yeah.
Jared Schmidt 46:27
Let's, let's go back a little bit. You were saying in the '70s, right, you were back, you were
working at the Creamery and everything was done by hand?
Dale Baumgartner 46:34
Everything was done by hand. Everything was done by hand.
Jared Schmidt 46:37
And that was your, that was your day-to-day, was?
Dale Baumgartner 46:39
You know, you had calluses on your hands. I had calluses here on my sides
Jared Schmidt 46:44
Really?
Dale Baumgartner 46:45
from sliding down the sides of the vats, cutting and stacking and ditching the vats and whatnot.
All, all, whole by all manual labor clear up until 1990.
Jared Schmidt 46:57
What was your position title at that point was it...What was your job title at that point?
Dale Baumgartner 47:02
Oh, I was a grunt then [both laugh].
Jared Schmidt 47:06
That's what it said on your a tax from, was...
D
D
D
D
D
That's what it said on your a tax from, was...
Dale Baumgartner 47:08
From 1968 until 1990...I think it was 1992 when I dropped out of the union as a teamsters
union near and went management and in preparations are taken over free MGH when are you
know, down the line. And what ended up happening was like when I was talking about him 13
cheesemakers all showed up. Well, they all started splitting off because they weren't gonna
listen to somebody tell them what to do. And they all want a day shift. It really opened the door
for me. You know, I was, you know, I grew up on a farm. Most kids back then grew up in a form.
And you were used to working and what's not, we're not there today.
Jared Schmidt 48:07
What's my high school classmates? Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 48:10
Anyway, I was interested in learning this stuff and, you know, the only way you're gonna learn
that stuff is to put in a lot of hours and there's overtime hours to be put in. You know, you don't
tear the equipment down during the daytime because you're using it during the daytime. So it's
nighttime hours to tear down equipment and fix things.
Jared Schmidt 48:29
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 48:29
USDA inspections and all that. And so, I ended up just learning, I ended up stepping to the plate
and learning all this equipment, how to tear it down and put it back together and how, you
know, I was here when we put the cheddaring machine together put the belts in.
Jared Schmidt 48:45
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 48:45
But the mill in, all this, so, I just had an upper hand to some extent because all these guys
dropped off and it came down to me and Butch, really, and ED.
D
D
D
D
Jared Schmidt 48:56
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 48:57
And, you know, Butch ended up kind of having kind of almost like a nervous breakdown. And
before it was all over with and ended up going to century, so it just left me and then in 1990, n
April of 1996, Ed, Ed left the company and I took over.
Jared Schmidt 49:25
And your position then, was...?
Dale Baumgartner 49:27
Head cheesemaker.
Jared Schmidt 49:28
As head cheese maker.
Dale Baumgartner 49:29
Yeah. You know, though, you know, then, you know we had, uh...Well, we just, you know, we
had. I just, I've never have really liked to telephone, talking on the telephone. And so that was a
big adjustment talking to old salesmen and all, you know. We really, at that point in '96, you
know, we didn't have a purchasing department. So, you know, you just picked the phone up
and...send so much, you know.
Jared Schmidt 50:04
Right.
Dale Baumgartner 50:04
And it was just amazing how things change, you know? You know, and then we got to where,
you know, now, '98 now, I'm traveling. I'm traveling to Twin Falls, Idaho, I'm flying to Boise all
the time.
Jared Schmidt 50:24
D
D
D
D
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 50:24
Renting a car and going to Twin Falls to make cheese there.
Jared Schmidt 50:30
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 50:31
Did that all the time, you know [chuckles].
Jared Schmidt 50:32
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 50:33
You know, I mean, it just seemed like you could almost tell when you were there and when you
weren't there as far as the cheese quality.
Jared Schmidt 50:40
Really?
Dale Baumgartner 50:41
Yeah. It seemed that way. Yes.
Jared Schmidt 50:43
Okay.
Dale Baumgartner 50:44
To us and, you know, when, when we ended up going, taking some cheese production to
Sunnyside, Washington, to Dairygold, there
D
D
D
D
D
Jared Schmidt 50:54
Okay.
Dale Baumgartner 50:54
we actually ended up sending Ed Sander up there to live and so he was in the plant every day.
Jared Schmidt 51:02
Okay.
Dale Baumgartner 51:03
Because we figured it out, you know, they, they're cutting corners when we're not there and
whatnot so [Clears throat]. But, you know, that went on and then, and, you know, I'm going to
Twin Falls, and then at the same time, we're building a brand new plant in Bordeman, and
we're going to start up in July of 2001. And now I'm living in a motel and Bordeman [both
laugh]. I lived in a motel Boredman, I think it was like nine months.
Jared Schmidt 51:31
Mkay.
Dale Baumgartner 51:32
And uh, came home every once in a while.
Jared Schmidt 51:35
Right.
Dale Baumgartner 51:37
Pretty much, you know, when we, when we started that plant up the programmers were
running way behind. So we had to manually operate all the valves and everything manually
from from July to, it wasn't till November 2001, that they got to programming and we got the
automation part of the plant run and up in there and going and uh [clears throat]. You know it
was, it, it tied up, well, really it tied up pretty much almost the rest of my life there, you know, I
mean.
D
D
D
D
Jared Schmidt 52:14
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 52:15
From, from really 2001, to...I was still going over in 2016.
Jared Schmidt 52:23
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 52:25
I pretty much, I worked probably, I probably end up in them 15, 16 years, I probably ended up
putting in, probably three quarters of my time at Boardman plant
Jared Schmidt 52:36
Okay.
Dale Baumgartner 52:36
living in a motel over there.
Jared Schmidt 52:39
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 52:40
I worked there probably three quarters of my time.
Jared Schmidt 52:44
Okay, over in Boardman.
Dale Baumgartner 52:45
Yeah.
D
D
D
D
D
Jared Schmidt 52:45
Okay.
Dale Baumgartner 52:45
Yeah [laughs].
Jared Schmidt 52:47
Wow.
Dale Baumgartner 52:47
Yeah, so...
Jared Schmidt 52:48
Just a little bit of time on the road. Just a little windshield time.
Dale Baumgartner 52:51
Well, we ended up, we ended up...Well, it's from my house, here, it's a 242 mile drive.
Jared Schmidt 52:56
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 52:56
[Both Dale and Jared chuckle] And, and, uh, it worked out, but it was definitely not the life, it's
not a real good life.
Jared Schmidt 53:07
Hmm.
Dale Baumgartner 53:07
But it worked out. I enjoyed, you know, I enjoyed the team over there. And uh, you know, we
D
D
D
D
D
But it worked out. I enjoyed, you know, I enjoyed the team over there. And uh, you know, we
ended up building a Boardman, what we call Boardman Two, we built a second plant over
there.
Jared Schmidt 53:19
Okay.
Dale Baumgartner 53:20
Then we built a whey plant over there. And, you know, I was able, you know, I was fortunate
enough to, to come from the, from the old days of making cheese by hand
Jared Schmidt 53:33
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 53:33
all the way to starting up the new automate cheese plant in Tillamook in 1990,
Jared Schmidt 53:40
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 53:40
starting up Boardman One in 2001.
Jared Schmidt 53:43
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 53:43
And then, 2005, or 2006, we started Boardman Two.
Jared Schmidt 53:48
Mkay.
D
D
D
D
Dale Baumgartner 53:48
So, you know, I was, you know, I was fortunate enough to start up three different cheese plants,
you know.
Jared Schmidt 53:54
Wow.
Dale Baumgartner 53:54
And, you know, starting up a cheese plant is huge.
Jared Schmidt 53:56
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 53:57
It's huge. It's a huge job, takes tremendous hours. And yeah.
Jared Schmidt 54:02
What would you say is some of the biggest surprise that you've seen, starting from the little
time in Hebo, which is just south of where we are, right?
Dale Baumgartner 54:11
Yeah.
Jared Schmidt 54:12
What would you say is the thing that surprised you the most between then and now, as far as,
like, the cheese manufacturing process?
Dale Baumgartner 54:20
If people knew how we made cheese back in the '70's [Chuckles] they would probably never
buy another loaf of cheese. [Laughs] And I'll show you, here, in just a minute, here. Because I
have a hoop, and a rags, and whatnot.
D
D
D
D
D
Jared Schmidt 54:35
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 54:35
Of how we made cheese back in the '70s and, uh...[Jared laughs]. You know as far as, as far as
quality, the...I think what, what it is, is the quality control is what is probably the biggest...the
complete biggest picture between the '70s and '80s and where we are today, it's got to be
quality control. Because, at the Hebo cheese factory, when we're making cheese, people can
stop and visit.
Jared Schmidt 54:35
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 54:35
Back then, you just reached in the vat, grabbed a handful of curds out of the vat, and just
handed it to them, and they ate it! They can take a tour.
Jared Schmidt 55:02
Right.
Dale Baumgartner 55:11
So, most of the time, there was three or four of us working on a day shift, on a shift there at the
Hebo cheese factory. We took turns showing, you know, the next people through, it's your turn
to take them around. And next time is your turn, and the next time is your turn.
Jared Schmidt 55:16
Right.
Dale Baumgartner 55:16
And so, he goes through there and if we, if we were, say we had some fresh curds, we just got
trough milling a vat., and we got some fresh curds there, just salted.
D
D
D
D
Jared Schmidt 55:32
Mkay.
Dale Baumgartner 55:32
Because I think there's, there's a lot of good bacteria out there that helps us also.
Jared Schmidt 55:32
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 55:32
Our immune systems are much weaker than they were back in the '80s, too.
Jared Schmidt 55:38
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 55:39
There's nothing better than warm, salted curds.
Jared Schmidt 55:44
Yeah. [With playful disgust] No. [Both laugh]
Dale Baumgartner 55:54
That went on, that went on clear up into the '70s.
Jared Schmidt 55:58
Yeah. I don't think the FDA would like that.
Dale Baumgartner 56:02
No, no, no, that's true. And, and, you know, the hoops we used.
D
D
D
D
D
Jared Schmidt 56:07
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 56:07
The hoops we used to make this cheese. I mean. Yeah, no, it was...I think, I think, I think we've
actually gone a little too far.
Jared Schmidt 56:20
Okay.
Dale Baumgartner 56:21
I believe we've gone a little too far on, on the cleanliness. I think, not...on the cleanliness
worldwide, actually.
Jared Schmidt 56:34
Mkay.
Dale Baumgartner 56:36
You know, if we had our immune, if everybody had their immune systems that they had back in
the '80s, the pandemic probably wouldn't have been near as bad as it was.
Jared Schmidt 56:55
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 56:57
But I see I think, yeah. And then, you know, that's, that's really the reason why we heat shock
our cheddar cheese, rather than fully pasturize.
Jared Schmidt 57:08
Okay, mhm.
D
D
D
D
Dale Baumgartner 57:08
Because there is, we know, that there's bacteria in that milk that helps us develop our
Tillamook flavor.
Jared Schmidt 57:15
Mkay.
Dale Baumgartner 57:15
You know, I worked back in the, I think it was '92, 1992, we worked, we worked a tremendous
amount with Oregon State University [Corvallis, Oregon] with cheese. They have a real nice
cheese program out there at Oregon State. And Bill Sandeen was there to time. And Bill
Sandeen and Floyd Bodyfelt. And we had an open table up here. And we use several different
strains of bacteria to, for our Starter Culture Program.
Jared Schmidt 57:50
Okay.
Dale Baumgartner 57:51
So, we worked with Oregon State University and Bill Sandeen, and we made cheese in that
open table, ssing single strains, we just used one strain of bacteria.
Jared Schmidt 58:07
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 58:07
And then we'd set that cheese back and we're waiting for 60 days. And we did that for a whole
summer.
Jared Schmidt 58:16
Mkay.
Dale Baumgartner 58:17
With, anyway, there was one of us intern, one of these interns helped me they're in the vat.
D
D
D
D
D
With, anyway, there was one of us intern, one of these interns helped me they're in the vat.
And we just kept using different, a bunch of different single strains that Bill'd came up with. And
we made cheese, and we sent it back, and you know, they'd come down, Bill and Floyd, and
we'd all go back and taste this trees, and, you know, [In a tone of disgust] "Oh! Ugh! It's going
the wrong direction. Not that one's out. That strains, out no good. And oh, geeze, this one here.
This is really developing some nice cheddar flavors. Let's keep this one."
Jared Schmidt 58:52
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 58:52
And then we ended up spending a whole summer there making cheese and we ended up
coming up with a bunch of strains that we use, we kept using and, so it's been a been a huge
learning. I mean, it's just just great. It's been great for me, it was great for me, that's all there is
to it.
Jared Schmidt 59:12
Yeah. How do you, you mentioned you can tell by tasting and all that, like what cheese is going
the wrong direction verses the right direction? What, how do you know if cheese is going the
right direction? What makes it do that? What makes, what...
Dale Baumgartner 59:25
You don't really know what makes it do that, you know. You know, you, you've got, say you've
got 150 producers.
Jared Schmidt 59:33
Okay.
Dale Baumgartner 59:34
Got 150 producers, you know, I know there isn't that many nowadays, now, but you know, at
one time we probably had 250 back in the '90s,
Jared Schmidt 59:44
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 59:44
D
D
D
Dale Baumgartner 59:44
2000, you know, and...
Jared Schmidt 59:46
By producers you mean, like, farmers, or?
Dale Baumgartner 59:48
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Producers.
Jared Schmidt 59:50
Okay.
Dale Baumgartner 59:51
So, say you have 200 producers. And, you know, you're relying on 200 producers to clean their
equipment on that farm just as good as you clean the equipment in your plant.
Jared Schmidt 1:00:08
Hm hm.
Dale Baumgartner 1:00:09
Seriously.
Jared Schmidt 1:00:10
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 1:00:11
You know what I mean?
Jared Schmidt 1:00:12
Mhm.
D
D
D
D
D
Dale Baumgartner 1:00:13
And, you know, your, well, it's no different than anything else.
Jared Schmidt 1:00:20
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 1:00:21
Somebody's milk cooler broke down. He calls the cheese plant and says, "Oh my milk coolers
down." You know, they have recording charts on them, recording the temperature so you can
see. Anyway, he goes out to the barn and, "Oh my god, the cooling system's down. And my
milk is, instead of being down in the 40s, my milk is, my milk is 55 in my...I got 5,000 pounds of
milk in my bulk tank here that is 55 degrees." They will call the cheese factory, will get hold of
the field man, to field man will go out to the farm, he'll taste the milk, or smell the milk. He'll
determine whether we can pick it up or not bring it in.
Jared Schmidt 1:01:06
Mkay.
Dale Baumgartner 1:01:06
So, say he says, "Yeah, yeah, I think it's gonna be good. I think it's gonna be okay."
Jared Schmidt 1:01:10
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 1:01:10
We bring it in, you know, we don't have, at the plant we have silos.
Jared Schmidt 1:01:16
Right.
Dale Baumgartner 1:01:16
Anywhere from 200,000 pounds to half a million pounds. Silos, half million pound silos in
D
D
D
D
D
Boardman, you know. [Jared and Dale laugh] You know, you got 5,000 pounds of milk, here,
now you put it into silos, now you put it in this silo with 50,000 or 100,000 other pounds of milk.
Jared Schmidt 1:01:42
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 1:01:42
It gets mixed together, you know, and, and you know, I mean, it's just like anything else, you
know.
Jared Schmidt 1:01:47
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 1:01:48
There's always breakdowns, there's always problems, you're going to have some farmers that
have problems, maybe somebody didn't wash the udders of the cow quite so good to, this day
as they did the day before. Or maybe this hired man washes the bags better than the other
farmer, you know, the hired man, and, it just, it just. We actually, Tillamook, we actually run a
vacuum chamber.
Jared Schmidt 1:02:14
Mkay.
Dale Baumgartner 1:02:14
Which is rare out there in the industry.
Jared Schmidt 1:02:17
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 1:02:18
And, you know, back in the '70s we had, we made cheese and we put it on pallets, and we put
it in the vacuum chamber, and turned it on, and ran it for 20 minutes. And it actually took the
air, it would remove the air from the cheese mechanical openings I'll show you a picture here in
D
D
D
D
a little bit.
Jared Schmidt 1:02:41
Okay, yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 1:02:41
Anyway, that removed the mechanical openings. And then, in 1985, we put in our new milk
pasteurizer there, and we actually installed a vacuum chamber in-line.
Jared Schmidt 1:02:53
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 1:02:55
And this is really, takes the air out of the milk, but it also removes off flavors. You know, like if
you were, walked back into the milk pasteurizer room in say, late-August, -September, when
they're doing all the corn chopping,
Jared Schmidt 1:03:14
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 1:03:15
and they're starting to feed corn silage.
Jared Schmidt 1:03:17
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 1:03:17
You could smell a little corn in there, you could actually smell a little corn in the room.
Jared Schmidt 1:03:22
In the Creamery?
D
D
D
D
Dale Baumgartner 1:03:22
In the milk pasteurizer room.
Jared Schmidt 1:03:25
Hmm.
Dale Baumgartner 1:03:25
And this, this just vacuum chamber is removing these off flavors. It actually helps remove these
off flavors in the milk.
Jared Schmidt 1:03:32
No kidding?
Dale Baumgartner 1:03:33
Yes. And, I mean, that, you know, things that...
Jared Schmidt 1:03:38
Coming from corn and soybean country I can,I can believe that.
Dale Baumgartner 1:03:40
You know yeah. You got your corn over in Boardman, you know, their carrots, all kinds of stuff,
they're feeding the cows.
Jared Schmidt 1:03:51
Hmm.
Dale Baumgartner 1:03:52
And it's free, you know, kind of lower cost feed for the farmer and you got to deal with it.
Jared Schmidt 1:03:58
D
D
D
D
D
Jared Schmidt 1:03:58
Right.
Dale Baumgartner 1:03:58
[With laughter] So, it's up to us, you know, as cheese makers to deal with it. Because, at the
farm level, they don't care.
Jared Schmidt 1:04:04
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 1:04:04
You know, milk, you know, they think milk's milk, and milk's not just milk. [Jared laughs]
Anyway, it's the quality of milk that makes cheese that you can sit back and age for 17 years.
Jared Schmidt 1:04:16
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 1:04:17
It's the quality of milk, when it comes down to it.
Jared Schmidt 1:04:21
That's interesting. Yeah, that makes a lot of sense, especially since you said, you're bringing in
so many different people together, right?
Dale Baumgartner 1:04:27
[Dale walks over to a corner of the room with posters, grabs one, and brings it over to show
Jared] You know, that's another huge that's another huge accomplishment, there, you know?
That's huge. That's, that's cheese, that is cheese from all over the world.
Jared Schmidt 1:04:41
[Reading poster] "Best medium cheddar in the world."
D
D
D
D
Dale Baumgartner 1:04:43
That was in a contest with cheese from all over the world. Or medium cheddar cheese in 2010,
and, you know that's a...
Jared Schmidt 1:04:52
Wow.
Dale Baumgartner 1:04:53
That's just a big accomplishment for Tillamook, you know.
Jared Schmidt 1:04:56
Yeah. Congratulations.
Dale Baumgartner 1:04:58
[Chuckle] Thanks.
Jared Schmidt 1:04:58
That's super cool. [Reading poster] "Tastes better because it's made better.' [Dale laughs] And
you had something, and and that was your fingerprints all over it, right Dale?
Dale Baumgartner 1:05:09
[Laughs] Yeah. [Grabbing a different poster] This is a picture, this is a picture of...
Jared Schmidt 1:05:16
Oh, wow! Look at this!
Dale Baumgartner 1:05:17
This is probably from '50s or '60s.
Jared Schmidt 1:05:20
Yeah.
D
D
D
D
D
Dale Baumgartner 1:05:22
This is a five pound loaf of cheese.
Jared Schmidt 1:05:24
Okay.
Dale Baumgartner 1:05:24
This is how they were made. That's the cheese cloth with wax on it
Jared Schmidt 1:05:29
Right.
Dale Baumgartner 1:05:29
that's been whacked off. And then we branded them just like that.
Jared Schmidt 1:05:34
Mhm. With Tillamook across it and the little...
Dale Baumgartner 1:05:35
You know, like there, you can see a little slit in the cheese.
Jared Schmidt 1:05:38
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 1:05:38
They're what we called mechanical openings.
Jared Schmidt 1:05:41
Okay.
D
D
D
D
D
Okay.
Dale Baumgartner 1:05:41
That's because, back then, we didn't know anything about vacuum chambers.
Jared Schmidt 1:05:45
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 1:05:46
[Laughs]
Jared Schmidt 1:05:48
"Look for Tillamook on the rind." Oh, I love it. I'll have to get a picture of that later.
Dale Baumgartner 1:05:53
Okay.
Jared Schmidt 1:05:54
That's super cool. I like all that old vintage art work.
Dale Baumgartner 1:05:57
Oh I've got piles of, piles of, you know the wheels. The wheels were, they were a little thick.
These were cut out of 40 pounders
Jared Schmidt 1:06:08
Okay.
Dale Baumgartner 1:06:08
for the 100th anniversary, or 105th anniversary.
Jared Schmidt 1:06:11
D
D
D
D
D
Jared Schmidt 1:06:11
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 1:06:13
But back when we made the wheels they were a little thicker.
Jared Schmidt 1:06:18
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 1:06:20
And you had a board here and a Tillamook, Tillamook, Tillamook, Tillamook branding deal, and
you'd ink that, and you'd put it on there and you'd...
Jared Schmidt 1:06:29
Roll it across?
Dale Baumgartner 1:06:30
Roll it and it'd have Tillamook all the way around. [Jared laughs] Yeah, that's how we made all
the cheese.
Jared Schmidt 1:06:36
Oh man. So, were you still doing that kind of work, by hand, when you were the, because you in
1996, you said you took over...
Dale Baumgartner 1:06:43
We quit make, we quit making the wheels in 1988, was the last of the wheels.
Jared Schmidt 1:06:47
Okay.
Dale Baumgartner 1:06:48
The last two wheels was '88.
D
D
D
D
D
The last two wheels was '88.
Jared Schmidt 1:06:49
Okay.
Dale Baumgartner 1:06:50
And then we went to, pretty much, pretty much all 40 pounders. We did, we did mess around
with a little bit of wheels later in, in the demo vat. I actually have, I have a bunch of wheels out
there in the refrigerator.
Jared Schmidt 1:07:09
Nice.
Dale Baumgartner 1:07:11
I never gave it up.
Jared Schmidt 1:07:12
Good.
Dale Baumgartner 1:07:15
That open vat, we continued to make cheese in that open vat until after they quit making,
using that open table after I left and,I left at the end of 2017.
Jared Schmidt 1:07:31
That's when you retired?
Dale Baumgartner 1:07:32
Yeah, I worked about three months out of 2018 on the consultings and things but a...They quit
using that table, then, that. But, making cheese by hand in that vat for retail curd and that was
an opportunity to teach new employees what that enclosed cheddaring machine is doing for
you.
Jared Schmidt 1:07:59
D
D
D
D
Jared Schmidt 1:07:59
Right. Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 1:08:01
[Chuckles] You know.
Jared Schmidt 1:08:02
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 1:08:02
I mean it's, it's huge.
Jared Schmidt 1:08:05
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 1:08:06
It's absolutely huge what it's doing in there.
Jared Schmidt 1:08:08
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 1:08:08
You know, you can teach them something on how to, how to make cheese in that open table,
open vat. You know, cutting it, you know, setting it up, coagulating it, cutting it, you know, the
importance of being handling it with care and rolling the cheese to get the moisture out, to get
the moisture down to where you want it for, for your cheese whatever you're making there, you
know. You know, like on our, our Hobenero cheese.
Jared Schmidt 1:08:43
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 1:08:43
D
D
D
D
D
You know, we developed, I developed a recipe for it in that demo vat.
Jared Schmidt 1:08:47
Mkay.
Dale Baumgartner 1:08:48
And then took it to Boardman.
Jared Schmidt 1:08:49
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 1:08:50
Our smoked black pepper cheese, it was all to, all those recipes were developed in that open
table and then taken to big equipment.
Jared Schmidt 1:08:59
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 1:08:59
And you know, I mean it was it was a it's a huge learning tool that that there are they're,
they're not, as far as I know, they're not using it anymore. But it was, it was a, it was really
good to teach,for teaching tool, really,is what it was.
Jared Schmidt 1:09:15
Yeah! I can believe that.
Dale Baumgartner 1:09:16
Tremendous teaching tool.
Jared Schmidt 1:09:17
Yeah. So, you just said, a second ago, that you developed the recipe for the Habanero cheese?
D
D
D
D
Dale Baumgartner 1:09:24
The Habanero, the Habenero, and we did the smoked black pepper. We had a...
Jared Schmidt 1:09:32
Now you developed that one and the smoked black pepper?
Dale Baumgartner 1:09:34
We had, we had horseradish cheese at one time, we had...Jeeze, trying to think of what all
there is there's a...there's a...I got one here that I'm missing, I know that.
Jared Schmidt 1:09:54
What about the Cape Mears?
Dale Baumgartner 1:09:55
Huh?
Jared Schmidt 1:09:56
The Cape Mears.
Dale Baumgartner 1:09:57
Cape Mears, yeah, that was there. Hey, I was...
Jared Schmidt 1:09:59
Was that you?
Dale Baumgartner 1:09:59
That was right there, you bet!
Jared Schmidt 1:10:01
D
D
D
D
D
Because that has been, that's my, my girlfriend my, that's our favorite go-to-cheese.
Dale Baumgartner 1:10:04
Oh! to cheese. I've got Cape Mears right out there in the refrigerator, the original Cape Mears.
Jared Schmidt 1:10:09
I knew I liked you.
Dale Baumgartner 1:10:12
[Laughs]
Jared Schmidt 1:10:12
So that was your design?
Dale Baumgartner 1:10:13
Oh, absolutely.
Jared Schmidt 1:10:14
What's that like? Can you tell me about that process of how you like...?
Dale Baumgartner 1:10:17
Oh, it's just it's just, you know. It was me and Gary Burningham working together to develop
that.
Jared Schmidt 1:10:23
The Cape Mears.
Dale Baumgartner 1:10:24
Jill Allen, um, I'm not sure just what her title is up there at the to cheese factory, but, you know,
she was on the, what do you call it the development, the, the...
D
D
D
D
D
Jared Schmidt 1:10:39
Research and Development, kind of?
Dale Baumgartner 1:10:41
The research and development side of things, there. And, anyway, "Yeah, we'd like to, we'd like
to come up with a kind of Irish, you know, kind of came from Ireland," really, you know.
Jared Schmidt 1:10:54
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 1:10:54
You know. And we'd like to, and you know, I get talking to Gary about it. No, I [ILL] . And, you
know, Gary'd come up here, stay a few days. And we use that demo vat and we'd try this
culture, and then we'd try to use, we just tried a bunch of stuff until we come up with
something that we wanted really just kind of trial and error.
Jared Schmidt 1:11:14
Really, just kind of trial and error?
Dale Baumgartner 1:11:15
Yeah, absolutely. Trial and error. Absolutely.
Jared Schmidt 1:11:17
And how did you decide, like, what made you, what made you go this one? Like this is the
recipe was it...?
Dale Baumgartner 1:11:23
You know, Jill's team in the sensory, I don't know though we ever reached on that,on that Cape
Mears. I don't know, though, we really ever seen eye to eye on it completely. But, Gary, and I
knew we had a good product.
Jared Schmidt 1:11:42
Mhm.
D
D
D
D
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 1:11:45
But I think he did. It was a good product. He has a good product.
Jared Schmidt 1:11:53
I think so.
Dale Baumgartner 1:11:53
Sales and marketing was probably the biggest pain in the ace there was on that.
Jared Schmidt 1:11:59
Hmm. Okay.
Dale Baumgartner 1:11:59
Because they were they wanted sales and marketing seemed to want something out there to
12 to 15 months range.
Jared Schmidt 1:12:10
Okay.
Dale Baumgartner 1:12:12
We were developing, excellent. Excellent. What we call it back then before he didn't have a
name at that, right. We call it sweet chatter. Back then, we felt we had a sweet cheddar
product that was very marketable at two to six months. There was no reason to hold on to it for
12 or 15 months. When when when when we had extra flavor developing it at three, four or five
months already. But yeah, yeah, we were Yeah. Yeah, I've got a bunch of that out here and
refrigerator.
Jared Schmidt 1:12:55
I want to say thank you for that, because that is...
Dale Baumgartner 1:12:58
D
D
D
D
D
Dale Baumgartner 1:12:58
[Laughs]
Jared Schmidt 1:12:58
That is, and then, Cape Mears, did you name, did you name it or was that somebody else?
Dale Baumgartner 1:13:01
No, no, that was all them.
Jared Schmidt 1:13:04
Okay. The day we felt very clever was when we brought some Cape Mears cheese out to the
Cape Mears lighthouse, and had some there.
Dale Baumgartner 1:13:11
Okay! [Laughs]
Jared Schmidt 1:13:11
We felt very clever that that afternoon when we did that. Yeah. All right. Yeah. I have so many
questions left [Dale laughs] [Phone rings]. Do you need to get that phone, or?
Dale Baumgartner 1:13:21
No, no. It's gonna sit there and ring.
Jared Schmidt 1:13:23
Okay, so, so as the head, sorry, as the head cheesemaker, your job included, setting up,
creating new creameries developing new cheeses, well, I mean, what else did you do? [Both
laugh]
Dale Baumgartner 1:13:39
I tore down equipment all the time.
Jared Schmidt 1:13:41
D
D
D
D
D
Jared Schmidt 1:13:41
You, what was that?
Dale Baumgartner 1:13:42
Tore down equipment all the time, you know, the equipment, training people how to tear down
and whatnot.
Jared Schmidt 1:13:48
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 1:13:49
Doing USDA inspections. You know, I just knew the ins and outs of all the equipment, you know,
over them many years. And, you know, training, training the new guys, you know, because you
know, you can only be there so long.
Jared Schmidt 1:14:06
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 1:14:07
And, you know, I ended up Corporate Artists and Cheese Master, I think is where I ended up at.
Jared Schmidt 1:14:17
Mkay.
Dale Baumgartner 1:14:19
But uh, you know, you just. Hey, I was out on the floor. I was out on the floor, I hated the office.
You know, you have to spend time in your office, but...
Jared Schmidt 1:14:35
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 1:14:35
I was out on the floor. I'm sure they would, they would tell you too much, but...[Jared laughs] I
D
D
D
D
D
I was out on the floor. I'm sure they would, they would tell you too much, but...[Jared laughs] I
knew what was going on out the floor at all times.
Jared Schmidt 1:14:45
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 1:14:46
Yeah, I think that made a big difference. Yeah, yeah. It may makes a big difference when
somebody that knows something's out on the floor and they know what's going on...
Jared Schmidt 1:14:49
Right, like a general at the front sort of situation. Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 1:14:50
You know, I still make cheese every day. [Laughs] I just knew enough to where I knew when I
was being buffaloed, or, you know.
Jared Schmidt 1:14:50
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 1:14:50
Yeah, it was good career, that's for sure.
Jared Schmidt 1:14:50
Yeah. What's your, what's your favorite parts about doing your job? What did you, what did you
love the most? Like, what made you wake up and say "Yes, I want to keep doing this." Oh really
Dale Baumgartner 1:15:25
Oh absolutely.
Jared Schmidt 1:15:26
In your retirement you still do this?
D
D
D
D
In your retirement you still do this?
Dale Baumgartner 1:15:27
I think of, I think cheese making all the time. All the time.
Jared Schmidt 1:15:30
Hmm.
Dale Baumgartner 1:15:31
You know, you know, you're just constantly, things are changing all the time. You know, the,
you had to stay up with, you had to stay up with the changes because your suppliers are
constantly, you know, they're...Your suppliers are trying to make money too, so they're trying
to cut corners too.
Jared Schmidt 1:16:01
Right.
Dale Baumgartner 1:16:01
And, you know, we, a lot of times we wouldn't find things out until
Jared Schmidt 1:16:07
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 1:16:08
we should have found out way sooner, you know, or they should have confessed that they were
changing a recipe at their end on a product that we're using.
Jared Schmidt 1:16:17
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 1:16:17
You know, they should have let us know ahead of time, that we'd catch it, you know, just be,
just because we're so thorough.
D
D
D
D
D
just because we're so thorough.
Jared Schmidt 1:16:26
Right.
Dale Baumgartner 1:16:27
You know, we save cheese out of every single batch of cheese just made, that's gonna be
tested by the sensory lab.
Jared Schmidt 1:16:33
Mkay.
Dale Baumgartner 1:16:33
When I was at the Tillamook plant I would go back to sensory in the morning so that I could be
there when they were grading cheese, because I want to know what's going out to the general
public. I want to know. And then, not only that, but packaging department is right...You know,
you got to cheese making here, you got packaging department here. I can walk from cheese
right over to packaging when they're dumping in 40 pound block of cheese, and I can take a
knife and cut it off cut off a piece of cheese and I can taste it right here. I know what's going on
down the line that's going to be out there on the store shelf in just a few weeks
Jared Schmidt 1:16:54
Mhm. Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 1:17:12
to some customer. You know, I was out there constantly taking cheese because I wanted to
know what's going out to the customers.
Jared Schmidt 1:17:18
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 1:17:18
You know, you care about it. I mean, I did, I cared, I wanted them to be getting the best cheesy
buy, you know.
D
D
D
D
Jared Schmidt 1:17:24
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 1:17:26
But I, I've watched a cooking show. You know, there are certain cooks that used Tillamook
cheese.
Jared Schmidt 1:17:33
Oh yeah?
Dale Baumgartner 1:17:33
I see it on TV where there's cooks that use, they go for Tillamook cheese.
Jared Schmidt 1:17:38
Like on the Food Network, or?
Dale Baumgartner 1:17:39
On the Food Network.
Jared Schmidt 1:17:39
Oh really? Compared to anybody else?
Dale Baumgartner 1:17:40
They go for, they go for Tillamook cheese on that store shelf. And, you know, I mean, I know, I
can tell Tillamook cheese by the color. Tillamook chees is... To anybody else. Really? Tillamook
cheese is the lightest colored cheese out on the market.
Jared Schmidt 1:17:54
Huh.
D
D
D
D
Dale Baumgartner 1:17:54
And, you know, we make cheese with no color, and we make it white and colored.
Jared Schmidt 1:18:04
Right.
Dale Baumgartner 1:18:04
But our colored cheese is the lightest colored cheese out on the market.
Jared Schmidt 1:18:08
Okay, good to know.
Dale Baumgartner 1:18:10
In the Tillamook medium?
Jared Schmidt 1:18:11
Yeah, okay.
Dale Baumgartner 1:18:12
In the Tillamook medium,not in the Bandon.
Jared Schmidt 1:18:14
Okay, those qualifiers, gotta make sure which, yeah... Right.
Dale Baumgartner 1:18:17
But, but and then, I think we've actually, I think we've actually...You know, everybody out in the
industry says the cheese color doesn't affect the cheese. But we, we have always, kind of really
felt like cheese color did actually affect aging some, and the flavor development, and whatnot, I
think. But it is the lightest color. [Pounds table twice] I can, I can go into a restaurant, and
somebody says they have Tillamook cheese on the, on the menu, there,when you ordered and
when it comes. Hell, we were down there...You know we bought Bandon Cheese Factory
D
D
D
D
D
[Bandon, Oregon]. And, so then, now I was traveling to Bandon all the time. And we was on our
way down to Bandon, stoped there for a sandwich to eat somewhere down the coast. I don't
remember where it was. Florence [Oregon] or somewhere down there.
Jared Schmidt 1:19:07
Mkay.
Dale Baumgartner 1:19:07
They said to had Tillamook cheese on their burgers, and we got our burgers, and I told the
waitress she was full of shit. [Jared laughs] It wasn't Tillamook cheese. I can tell by the, I can
tell by the color. Yeah.
Jared Schmidt 1:19:22
What did the server say?
Dale Baumgartner 1:19:24
Oh, she's she was just embarrassed. But I said, "Hey, I said that's not Tillamook cheese." I said
I'm from Tillamook cheese. She just, you know, they weren't expecting somebody that knew.
Jared Schmidt 1:19:32
They weren't expecting the man. [Laughs]
Dale Baumgartner 1:19:33
Yeah, yeah [Laughs]. They got surprised. Yeah, yeah, definitely. They definitely got surprised.
Jared Schmidt 1:19:40
That's funny
Dale Baumgartner 1:19:40
Yeah, I wasn't gonna put up with that.
Jared Schmidt 1:19:43
D
D
D
D
Jared Schmidt 1:19:43
Yeah. That's funny.
Dale Baumgartner 1:19:44
Too many years for that.
Jared Schmidt 1:19:45
Right. When youm when you, you've mentioned you seen it on, on TV.
Dale Baumgartner 1:19:49
Oh yeah.
Jared Schmidt 1:19:49
Like the Food Network. What, what do think when you...
Dale Baumgartner 1:19:52
Oh, I feel great about it! I know that he is dealing, he is dealing with the best cheese there is.
That's all there is to it.
Jared Schmidt 1:20:00
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 1:20:01
Hey, I mean, I taste cheese.I love, I love going out here and, you know, tasting and other
people's cheese.
Jared Schmidt 1:20:10
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 1:20:11
Even, even their ice cream. Just, Tillamook ice cream just blows everybody else's ice cream
clear out of the water.
D
D
D
D
D
Jared Schmidt 1:20:16
Oh, if you're expecting an argument out of me, you're not gonna get one.
Dale Baumgartner 1:20:19
But, you know, I mean, and our cheese. You know, I mean when they go for tilma cheese, you
know they're, they're going for the best and you don't mean you can talk to a lot of people
even at the store shelf, you'll Joma cheese might be a little bit more more expensive. Maybe
their finances are a little tight right now and they just can't, you know, they have to buy that
piece of cheese, and I understand that.
Jared Schmidt 1:20:41
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 1:20:41
But when, [Pounds table twice] you know, if you want the best. I mean, you can go anywhere. I
can wear my Tillamook shirt. You know, I spend half the summer and Bend [Oregon] in Sun
River
Jared Schmidt 1:20:52
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 1:20:53
in the summertime, you know, we got a condo in Sun River and, you know. I'd wear my tilma
shirt over there. Hey, I've got a Tillamook, I've got a Tillamook bicycle jersey that I wear.
Jared Schmidt 1:21:06
Okay.
Dale Baumgartner 1:21:06
I've worn my Tillamook bicycle jersey over there in Moose [Wyoming] just outside of Jackson,
well, Grand Teton National Park.
D
D
D
D
Jared Schmidt 1:21:14
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 1:21:14
I was riding my bicycle out there on the dirt trails and, Tillamook, you know and Tillamook
Cheese jersey on there, [Excitedly] "Oh man! Oh, that's the best cheese there is!" [Jared
laughs] Hey, I hear this all the time when I have my Tillamook shirt on.
Jared Schmidt 1:21:15
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 1:21:17
And, you know, people know what it, is people know it is. It just depends on whether, you know,
your finances can afford it, this day or that day, or whatever. People know that it's a quality
product.
Jared Schmidt 1:21:39
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 1:21:40
But I think that cheese making, that, believe me, it never, won't ever go away.
Jared Schmidt 1:21:46
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 1:21:48
They won't go away it's, it's there.
Jared Schmidt 1:21:51
What about cheese draws you so much to it, as opposed to any other dairy product or food
product. What about cheese is like so captivating?
D
D
D
D
Dale Baumgartner 1:22:03
You know, I have only had one job my life. I've never filled out a job application in my life.
Jared Schmidt 1:22:08
You're not missing anything. [Both laugh]
Dale Baumgartner 1:22:14
You know, I just got, you know, it's one of those things that I got into when I was just a kid, you
know. 16.
Jared Schmidt 1:22:19
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 1:22:21
And when I started at the Hebo Cheese Factory, I started, I was making $1.91 an hour. Dollar
91.
Jared Schmidt 1:22:30
Wow!
Dale Baumgartner 1:22:31
And I thought I was raking it in.
Jared Schmidt 1:22:35
[Laughs]
Dale Baumgartner 1:22:37
You know, I think, I think, you know. I mean, if you were, if you are making, I think, what I
think..I think the biggest example, I think is Boardman, when we started up Boardman One.
Jared Schmidt 1:22:52
D
D
D
D
D
Jared Schmidt 1:22:52
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 1:22:55
You know, I know that Tillamook is making a top notch quality product.
Jared Schmidt 1:23:01
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 1:23:02
And our, our goal was to start out Boardman One, and to continue making absolute top quality
cheese.
Jared Schmidt 1:23:13
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 1:23:14
But, now you have a brand new plant, you're getting ready to startup. And you have a real
diverse population of employees.
Jared Schmidt 1:23:29
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 1:23:31
Because it's out in nowhere.
Jared Schmidt 1:23:36
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 1:23:36
And now you're, you've got to, you've got to convince 70, 80 employees that our goal here is to
make nothing but the best cheeser there is.
D
D
D
D
D
make nothing but the best cheeser there is.
Jared Schmidt 1:23:53
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 1:23:55
And, you know, I'd have to say it took a couple years.
Jared Schmidt 1:23:59
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 1:23:59
Maybe a little longer.
Jared Schmidt 1:24:01
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 1:24:02
But it wasn't long, and you heard them guys, and when you heard thm people saying, "Oh man,
boy, when I go to the grocery store, I buy Tillamook cheese." And, you know, the other thing
that really made them proud was they, they went to the store to buy that loaf of Tillamook
cheese,
Jared Schmidt 1:24:24
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 1:24:24
because that might be a cheese that I handled.
Jared Schmidt 1:24:28
Yeah.
D
D
D
D
Dale Baumgartner 1:24:28
This might be a piece that [Pounds table] I made. I might [Pounds table] have been running the
cooking vats this day when we made this [Pounds table] cheese. [Pounds table] And this might
be the one, one of them out of that vat of cheese.
Jared Schmidt 1:24:38
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 1:24:38
And you start hearing that from them and they were proud of it.
Jared Schmidt 1:24:42
For the people on the floor that were working... Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 1:24:44
The everyday grunts. The everyday grunt is out there doing the work, making me look good.
But they, you know, there's, there's, there's just something about that. You know you're making
a product, when you can go out there in a store shelf anywhere you want here Northwest or,
their back east, now, and pick up that loaf of cheese, and say, "Hey, I helped make that loaf of
cheese."
Jared Schmidt 1:25:09
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 1:25:09
It's a big deal!
Jared Schmidt 1:25:10
Yeah!
Dale Baumgartner 1:25:11
It's a big deal.
D
D
D
D
D
Jared Schmidt 1:25:13
Yeah, it is. That's pretty cool.
Dale Baumgartner 1:25:14
[Laughs] You know.
Jared Schmidt 1:25:15
Yeah. And you say you bring cheese, we were speaking before we started recording about
bringing cheese out elk hunting in Wyoming.
Dale Baumgartner 1:25:22
Oh, absolutely. They look, they just, they can't wait for me to get there.
Jared Schmidt 1:25:27
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 1:25:27
How many people, I didn't take this, [In a hushed tone] I didn't take the 17-year-old. I have to
admit, I didn't take that.
Jared Schmidt 1:25:33
Okay. You didn't share that with the Wyomings.
Dale Baumgartner 1:25:37
But I took, I took some 2013 cheese over.
Jared Schmidt 1:25:41
Okay.
D
D
D
D
Dale Baumgartner 1:25:42
Which is, you know, they,they're not gonna find it over there.
Jared Schmidt 1:25:45
No.
Dale Baumgartner 1:25:45
They love it. They love it. They count on it. That's why that farmer stopped he didn't stop to
bullshit. He stopped to pick up cheese. [Both laugh]
Jared Schmidt 1:25:52
He wasn't there for you. He was there for what you brought.
Dale Baumgartner 1:25:58
But, you know, we, we, you know, we end up taking smoked fish over, we take, we we take
oysters over every year.
Jared Schmidt 1:26:03
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 1:26:04
And those guys barbecue 'em, you know. And, and cheese, oysters, salmon. I even took tuna
bellies, smoked tuna bellies over to them. And, you know, I mean, you know, it works out good
for me. And it works out good for them.
Jared Schmidt 1:26:20
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 1:26:21
You know, it really works out good.
Jared Schmidt 1:26:24
D
D
D
D
D
Jared Schmidt 1:26:24
Yeah. Where, when you've been traveling, where's, where have you been surprised to find
Tillamook cheese. You be like, "Hey, I didn't expect that there." What did you think, at all when
you see it somewhere that you didn't expect?
Dale Baumgartner 1:26:35
You know, you know, really I don't kno as I'm so surprised to see Tillamook cheese. What I think
surprises me the most is the price.
Jared Schmidt 1:26:50
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 1:26:51
Is when you like, say, even in Wyoming.
Jared Schmidt 1:26:53
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 1:26:54
Or, say you're back in Wisconsin, the price is just going to be horrendous. Sad to say, but it is.
Jared Schmidt 1:27:02
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 1:27:03
Seemed like, you know, there's a lot, there's just a tremendous amount of middleman markup
somewhere along the line. [Laughs] You know.
Jared Schmidt 1:27:12
Distribution costs, and blah, blah, blah.
Dale Baumgartner 1:27:13
D
D
D
D
D
Dale Baumgartner 1:27:13
It is. I don't, I mean, I was surprised to see some ice cream in Wyoming just because of the
Rockies
Jared Schmidt 1:27:22
Right.
Dale Baumgartner 1:27:22
and blowing the lids off,and they were actually, they were puffed up. They were puffed up. But,
you know, I always, when I go, when I'm somewhere, when I'm somewhere, I'm always winging
through the grocery store to look at the cheese section to see how big it is. You know, some
cheese handle, some stores may only handle just, you know, just a, just a little tiny bit.
Jared Schmidt 1:27:39
Yeah. Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 1:27:47
Some handle the shreds, and a slice, and everything, you know. But I'm always looking, I'm
always looking at these grocery stores or whatever. I'll have to admit that, I'm definitely guilty
as heck of that. But I'm proud of Tillamook cheese. You know, I'm proud of what I've done for
the company in everything. And, hey, I'm proud of the product.
Jared Schmidt 1:28:07
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 1:28:07
That's all there is to it, you know.
Jared Schmidt 1:28:09
Yeah!
Dale Baumgartner 1:28:09
I just wish more people knew where we came from, you know. From the '60s, to, or '50s, even,
for that matter, to where we are today, you know. We've come a long ways, baby. [Both laugh]
D
D
D
D
Jared Schmidt 1:28:27
I can see that. Yeah. Especially looking at the factory, or the today, right?
Dale Baumgartner 1:28:32
Yeah, right.
Jared Schmidt 1:28:32
Seeing it's one of the most popular tourist attractions even in Oregon, right.
Dale Baumgartner 1:28:38
Yeah.
Jared Schmidt 1:28:39
That's kinda, gotta feel pretty cool.
Dale Baumgartner 1:28:40
And, you know, we don't, we don't even have a tourist center or anything in Boardman, you
know.
Jared Schmidt 1:28:44
Okay.
Dale Baumgartner 1:28:45
And it's right on the freeway. It's right beside the freeway, you can see the, you can see the
plant and the silos from the freeway, as you go out of Boardman going east.
Jared Schmidt 1:28:54
Okay, Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 1:28:55
D
D
D
D
D
Dale Baumgartner 1:28:55
If we had a visitor center there with that freeway...
Jared Schmidt 1:28:58
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 1:28:59
Puh, man. It'd be huge, probably, you know. But, yeah, I think that's something we need to,
Tillamook needs to be real proud of, to is the, you know, we've done a quality job on that retail
center where people can watch the cheese being packaged
Jared Schmidt 1:29:15
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 1:29:15
and being made,and being packaged and. You know, it's a, it's a big deal.
Jared Schmidt 1:29:22
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 1:29:22
You know, that, all the equipment, pretty much, you know, the, the cheddaring machine, all out
of New Zealand. We got some cooking vats out of England. You know, it's, it's given me a
chance to travel around the world, that's for sure.
Jared Schmidt 1:29:44
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 1:29:45
You know, work with these companies making the equipment the way we want it made. You
always see it's a, it's a...You know, in 1990, when we were starting up the very first one in
Tillamook, and, you know, we fought it for the first couple years and we made changes, and
D
D
D
D
D
changes, and changes. You know, then when we, when we went back to New Zealand for
Boardman One, you know, these are the changes we've got. These are the changes we've gotta
have, you know. You know, you got to do this, this, this is how.
Jared Schmidt 1:29:49
Mhm. Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 1:30:19
So, I mean, these machines are, these machines have been built for us.
Jared Schmidt 1:30:25
Right. Cutom made, right?
Dale Baumgartner 1:30:28
You know, what we, what we know will make Tillamook cheese.
Jared Schmidt 1:30:29
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 1:30:30
Yeah, yeah.
Jared Schmidt 1:30:31
Hmm. You mentioned a second ago, Dale, about the town, right, and bringing people, in
bringing, the Creamery bringing people in. What do you think the overall impact of the
Creamery has on, on Tillamook the town and the County?
Dale Baumgartner 1:30:46
Ha! Oh, oh!
Jared Schmidt 1:30:46
I mean, you've watched it since the '50s and '60s, you know.
D
D
D
D
I mean, you've watched it since the '50s and '60s, you know.
Dale Baumgartner 1:30:49
You know, Tillamook, Tillamook cheese, i's got to be...Tillamook cheese, here, in Tillamook, is
keeping the county alive period, pretty much.
Jared Schmidt 1:31:05
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 1:31:05
You know, you take, and you take these producers, here. They may only be down to 100
producers now, but they're huge producers. You know, they're they're the big producers now.
Jared Schmidt 1:31:15
Right.
Dale Baumgartner 1:31:15
And every one of these producers has a tremendous amount of hired hands working.
Jared Schmidt 1:31:22
Mkay, yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 1:31:23
You know, I'm not sure just how many people are in Tillamook County all together. But we,
we've got thousands, there is thousands of people in Tillamook County that are relying on the
Creamy or on the working on a cheese farm every single day.
Jared Schmidt 1:31:40
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 1:31:42
You know, the Tillamook, Tillamook cheese has got to be one of the top, I wouldn't be surprised
if they're the top or maybe the second biggest employer in Tillamook.
D
D
D
D
D
if they're the top or maybe the second biggest employer in Tillamook.
Jared Schmidt 1:31:53
Yeah, I can believe that.
Dale Baumgartner 1:31:55
You know, I mean, we got Tillamook Country Smoker and Werner's, but I think Tillamook might
be the number one. I wouldn't be surprised if it was number one.
Jared Schmidt 1:32:04
Right.
Dale Baumgartner 1:32:04
And, and between the employees there at the cheese factory, and, well, I think, I think the last I
heard is over 900 employees all together.
Jared Schmidt 1:32:16
Okay, and I mean the sphere of influence on it, is...
Dale Baumgartner 1:32:18
But you've got Boardman, and you got Portland, you know?
Jared Schmidt 1:32:20
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 1:32:21
And then you got, you know, Tillamook, and then, you, now you got the farmers, you got
hundreds out there on the farm. All these farm families, you know, it's hard. Um, there's,
there's, there's times where I just don't even go places or go do things because I know I'm
going to run across a bunch of farmers. And then they want to, you know, they want to talk.
Jared Schmidt 1:32:41
D
D
D
D
Yeah. Right.
Dale Baumgartner 1:32:41
It's not as bad, now, as it was when I was working. But when I was working ,was actually
actively working, you know, to go to the farm store to get something was just almost a pain in
the rear. [Jared laughs] Because now I know I'm going to get bombarded, you know, with
questions and "Why are they doing this?" You know, the farmers want to know and, you know, I
don't, I don't want to get hung up in the middle or any of that stuff.
Jared Schmidt 1:33:07
Right.
Dale Baumgartner 1:33:09
You know, it's not hard to find out what's going on around here. You know, everybody in
Tillamook is related to [Jared laughs], everybody's related to somebody here in Tillamook, you
know.
Jared Schmidt 1:33:19
Small town living.
Dale Baumgartner 1:33:21
It is, small town living.
Jared Schmidt 1:33:22
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 1:33:22
And you gotta be careful, and yet. The Creamery, yeah, the Creamery is keeping Tillamook
County alive, that's for sure.
Jared Schmidt 1:33:31
Yeah. Especially during the pandemic with everybody eating cheese and everything was tough.
D
D
D
D
Dale Baumgartner 1:33:36
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Right. Yeah, right. Right. Yeah. No, it's been tremendous career, it's been
tremendous.
Jared Schmidt 1:33:43
And then you said, I have two more questions before I'll pause it for today, at least. You said
you made cheese still?
Dale Baumgartner 1:33:52
I just, I think about it all the time. You just think about it all the time. You know, you just, you
know, I don't drink, because I, I quit drinking beer, I think, in 1992, just because I was on call
24/7. And you know, them employees, you know, when they call at two o'clock in the morning,
they need an answer.
Jared Schmidt 1:34:14
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 1:34:17
When you're running, like at the Tillamook plant, you know, you're running, say 1.6 million
pounds of milk, and you start up, you know, you running your day, you run, you run, you
don't...Our days go more than 24 hours. We end up with like a 26 hour day.
Jared Schmidt 1:34:40
Mkay.
Dale Baumgartner 1:34:40
Because we're making cheese, but we're cleaning up right behind it.
Jared Schmidt 1:34:45
Right.
Dale Baumgartner 1:34:46
So you're, you're, and when you're making cheese...
D
D
D
D
D
So you're, you're, and when you're making cheese...
Jared Schmidt 1:34:50
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 1:34:51
You're, you're making cheese here, and it's going through the machine, and there's more
coming there's, more coming.
Jared Schmidt 1:35:00
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 1:35:00
And if you have a breakdown, here, now you have hundreds of thousands of backed up milk.
Jared Schmidt 1:35:07
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 1:35:09
Cheese making in different processes, you know, along the line. You're backing all this up.
Jared Schmidt 1:35:14
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 1:35:15
And there's, you know, I think, I think it's hard to get...When you're, when you're doing this
every single day, and you're handling, say you're handling four thousand 40 pound blocks a
day.
Jared Schmidt 1:35:35
Yeah. Just astounds me.
D
D
D
D
Dale Baumgartner 1:35:38
And you're, you're, you're sealing them up, and you're handling them all day long. You're,
you're eight or ten hour day is nothing but handling 40 pound blocks of cheese. Pretty soon
those blocks of cheese just kind of become pennies.
Jared Schmidt 1:35:52
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 1:35:53
You know, they're just pennies.
Jared Schmidt 1:35:54
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 1:35:56
You've got to, you've got to...Even when I was consulting after I retired, that was one of the
things that I thought was really lacking at the Boardman plant was employees didn't
understand how much money they were dealing with.
Jared Schmidt 1:36:16
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 1:36:17
You know, that block of, that, that 40 pound block of cheese, there, is worth several hundred
dollars.
Jared Schmidt 1:36:23
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 1:36:24
Now, do you want to, you want to handle it pretty good? Or do you want to just let it fall on the
floor?
D
D
D
D
D
floor?
Jared Schmidt 1:36:29
You said a 40 pound block is worth $700...?
Dale Baumgartner 1:36:32
It's probably, it's probably three...It's probably, it's got to be worth close to, that 40 pound block
of cheese is probably close to $200.
Jared Schmidt 1:36:44
Really?
Dale Baumgartner 1:36:44
And, you know, you handled thousands of them today.
Jared Schmidt 1:36:50
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 1:36:52
And, you know, the, that vat of, that, you just gotta...You've gotta let them know how much
things cost, or how much they're dealing with to get them to buy into, oh man. [Hits hand on
table enacting something fall on the floor] You know, that block of cheese bounces...Say that,
that block of cheese is down a conveyor and it falls off the conveyor. Or, or they were shooting
the breeze with somebody and not paying attention, and an eye I wasn't, an eye is looking
there, wasn't working, or something, or didn't work, and they back three or four of them, and
backed up and a couple of them fell off on the floor. Now they're going to go to the garbage
can.
Jared Schmidt 1:37:33
Yeah. That's $200 in the garbage.
Dale Baumgartner 1:37:36
Hey, that's your wages, today, that's going in the garbage can.
D
D
D
D
Jared Schmidt 1:37:41
Right.
Dale Baumgartner 1:37:41
You won't tp watch, you want to watch some more go on the floor? [Laughs]
Jared Schmidt 1:37:46
Yeah. No.
Dale Baumgartner 1:37:48
It's, you're just, you can lose, you can lose $50, $100,000 in a heartbeat.
Jared Schmidt 1:37:56
Really? Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 1:37:57
In a heartbeat.
Jared Schmidt 1:37:57
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 1:37:58
You can just flush it down the toilet in a heartbeat in a cheese plant.
Jared Schmidt 1:38:04
Hmm.
Dale Baumgartner 1:38:04
Believe me, you can lose $50,000 so fast you can't even believe it.
D
D
D
D
D
Jared Schmidt 1:38:09
Really? I can believe it.
Dale Baumgartner 1:38:10
You've got to be on top because there's things are moving, things are moving, things are
coming whether you want them to come or not.
Jared Schmidt 1:38:19
Yeah, like that I Love Lucy skit.
Dale Baumgartner 1:38:21
There is thousands of pounds of cheese coming at any one minute of the day.
Jared Schmidt 1:38:27
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 1:38:27
Thousands!
Jared Schmidt 1:38:29
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 1:38:29
And it's coming whether you want it or not.
Jared Schmidt 1:38:31
Mkay.
Dale Baumgartner 1:38:32
And, and if it doesn't come, it's going to go to, there's going to be some things going down the
D
D
D
D
D
And, and if it doesn't come, it's going to go to, there's going to be some things going down the
drain. [Jared laughs] I mean, it's huge. It's huge. It's big. You really got to be on top of things.
Jared Schmidt 1:38:46
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 1:38:47
It's so huge, it's not funny.
Jared Schmidt 1:38:49
I believe it. Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 1:38:51
You know, when you're, when you're, when you're dealing with, you know, 1.6 million here, and
3+ million over there in Boardman every day, you know, I mean, it's, it's a lot of milk.
Jared Schmidt 1:39:04
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 1:39:04
It's a lot of milk.
Jared Schmidt 1:39:05
That is yeah, because how many, much, how many gallons of milk come to the Creamery in
Tillamook?
Dale Baumgartner 1:39:10
Between the two,between two plants, we were pretty much running 5 million a day. 5 million
pounds of milk a day.
Jared Schmidt 1:39:16
5 million pounds of milk, or gallons?
D
D
D
D
5 million pounds of milk, or gallons?
Dale Baumgartner 1:39:18
5 million pounds of milk.
Jared Schmidt 1:39:19
Pounds of...Wow.
Dale Baumgartner 1:39:20
Yeah. A gallon eight, like eight-and-a-half pounds, you know.
Jared Schmidt 1:39:25
Still, like that's, that's some serious milk.
Dale Baumgartner 1:39:28
Oh! Yeah, that's a lot of gallons [Both laugh]
Jared Schmidt 1:39:30
That's a lot of milk. So then, so when you're making your cheese, here, because you said you
make it in your own home, here, or?
Dale Baumgartner 1:39:39
I've actually made, made cheese in a, in a gallon, a gallon jar for my daughter, and she filmed it
for a science project at school.
Jared Schmidt 1:39:52
Aww.
Dale Baumgartner 1:39:52
And it worked out real good. I'm not sure where the tape is, now, but. You know, it takes, it
takes ten pounds of milk to make one pound of cheese.
D
D
D
D
D
Jared Schmidt 1:40:01
Okay.
Dale Baumgartner 1:40:02
So, 100, 100 pounds of milk is going to make...100 pounds of milk is going to, the way
Tillamook treats their milk, 100 pounds of milk is going to make about 11 pounds of cheese
[Pounds table]. Yeah, yes. Yes.
Jared Schmidt 1:40:19
Wow, I'm bad at math. 500, 5 million pounds of milk. Okay.
Dale Baumgartner 1:40:25
You...that's another mind boggling thing, is, you know, you're...We're gonna make, say, 450,
anywhere from 450 to 475,000 pounds of cheese today. And just, it's just, tomorrow, and the
day after.
Jared Schmidt 1:40:26
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 1:40:26
You know, it's just, it's just, it's hard to, they're just numbers that are huge that are, it's pretty
amazing.
Jared Schmidt 1:40:54
Right.
Dale Baumgartner 1:40:55
You know, this is how much cheese people are eating.
Jared Schmidt 1:40:58
Yeah. You'd think we like cheese in this country or something?
D
D
D
D
Dale Baumgartner 1:41:01
Yeah. [Jared laughs] It's amazing. Yeah.
Jared Schmidt 1:41:04
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 1:41:05
I don't know where my piece of paper is, I probably have it, I'm sure I have it here, on, you
know, the...I had broke down to how much milk, you know, we were running every day of
Boardman. I was just, I would make, I just made it for Boardman just so I could, I could meet
with each crew and let them know what, what, you know, how much milk we're running today.
Because, you know, as a, as an employee you come in, you're just, you just think your job is
just putting the bag on the towers, and pushing the button, and cheese comes out, and you go
down a conveyor, and you seal it and,
Jared Schmidt 1:41:41
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 1:41:41
that's my job, you know. I wanted them to understand how important their job was,b ecause, if
that sealer breaks down,
Jared Schmidt 1:41:50
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 1:41:50
[Pounds table] then that tower isn't running, we're gonna back up $50, $200,000 worth of
product.
Jared Schmidt 1:42:00
Yeah.
D
D
D
D
Dale Baumgartner 1:42:02
Is gonna be backed up in that cheddaring machine, and the cooking vat's waiting for you to get
that tower going.
Jared Schmidt 1:42:07
Right.
Dale Baumgartner 1:42:07
It's an important job, whether it's a grunt job or not, it has to be done. And we got it, you know,
it has to be done to keep the process moving here. And, you know, I had, you know, the cost of
how much milk was in a vat, you know, how many, you know, 50, 57,000 pounds of milk in the
this vat.
Jared Schmidt 1:42:27
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 1:42:28
It's worth $20,000, you know, [Changes voice pitch lower], "Wow! You're kidding me?"
Jared Schmidt 1:42:34
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 1:42:36
They just, it's amazing. It's amazing. It's some of the, you know, I mean, they were amazed,
they were amazed a lot of them were absolutely shocked.
Jared Schmidt 1:42:43
Yeah, it is astounding...
Dale Baumgartner 1:42:46
How much...How much cheese we're gonna make today.
D
D
D
D
D
Jared Schmidt 1:42:48
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 1:42:48
You know, how many 40 pound blocks we're gonna make.
Jared Schmidt 1:42:51
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 1:42:51
Thousands! And, and it's just, you know, it's the information you need to get your employee so
they understand that their job is important.
Jared Schmidt 1:42:58
Right, the weight of it.
Dale Baumgartner 1:43:01
Yeah. The weight of it. Yeah, that's right. Yeah.
Jared Schmidt 1:43:03
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 1:43:04
Absolutely.
Jared Schmidt 1:43:04
The weight of it and baby loaves.
Dale Baumgartner 1:43:07
[Laughs] Yeah, yeah.
D
D
D
D
D
Jared Schmidt 1:43:08
That's cool. And then so, it, so, how many times have you made cheese on your own at home,
then, since you retire.
Dale Baumgartner 1:43:14
Oh, I haven't made any here at home since I've been retired.
Jared Schmidt 1:43:17
Oh, okay.
Dale Baumgartner 1:43:17
No, I don't need to, hell, I've...I just, I just, I think about cheesemaking. I can be out here doing
something ,be thinking about, you know, you're just constantly thinking about cheesemaking.
Jared Schmidt 1:43:30
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 1:43:30
You're just, it'll probably, I'm sure it'll never go away.
Jared Schmidt 1:43:34
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 1:43:34
You know, that's just the way it is. You're just, been my life, you know?
Jared Schmidt 1:43:40
Yeah. Do you ever go back to the Creamery to do consulting, or?
Dale Baumgartner 1:43:42
D
D
D
D
D
Dale Baumgartner 1:43:42
Oh, yeah, yeah. Well, I don't anymore, I don't anymore but, uh, 2018 was the last of that but,
you know, I, you know, I talk to the guys and whatnot.
Jared Schmidt 1:43:57
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 1:43:57
In fact, actually, one of the, one of the guys I've worked with for about 40 years, he actually
passed away on Boardman, here just, funeral's tomorrow.
Jared Schmidt 1:44:10
I'm sorry.
Dale Baumgartner 1:44:11
He's the one that actually, I trained here in Tillamook to go, to move to Boardman to run the
operation in Boardman.
Jared Schmidt 1:44:18
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 1:44:18
And he passed away a couple few weeks ago and...
Jared Schmidt 1:44:22
I'm sorry.
Dale Baumgartner 1:44:24
Way too darn Young. God, it's just terrible. But, yeah, you just, it's just something you think
about all the time, you know.
Jared Schmidt 1:44:34
D
D
D
D
D
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 1:44:35
I love, you know, the quality of product we make, I think are just tremendous.
Jared Schmidt 1:44:42
Yeah, speaking of that history and that legacy aspect. What is it like when you see, when you
go to the Creamery, to see your face, and your part of the story on the timeline, right? [Dale
laughs] Because you are on the historic timeline of the, the overall arching history of the
Creamery, you're at the very tail end of it, but what's that, I mean, like, what's it like to see
your face in that moment?
Dale Baumgartner 1:45:02
I'm proud of it.
Jared Schmidt 1:45:05
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 1:45:05
I'm proud of it. And, you know, I feel like I, you know, I've been a huge, I've been a huge part of
their success for those farmers' success, you know?
Jared Schmidt 1:45:15
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 1:45:17
You know, they have, you have, you have branded product, and then you have commodity
cheese.
Jared Schmidt 1:45:28
Right.
D
D
D
D
Dale Baumgartner 1:45:29
Which is,
Jared Schmidt 1:45:30
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 1:45:31
you know, Dairy Gold's making [taps table], or Glambia's making [Taps table], or Kraft's making
[Taps table].
Jared Schmidt 1:45:37
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 1:45:37
And, you know, if we were making commodity cheese at Tillamook, there wouldn't be any
farmers in Tillamook.
Jared Schmidt 1:45:45
Okay.
Dale Baumgartner 1:45:46
They would be all out of business, they would have, they would have all been up, they would
have all went belly up years and years ago. Hmm. Just because of, the commodity cheese, you
know, you just, you just pay the farmers whether you got rock bottom for their milk.
Jared Schmidt 1:46:04
Right.
Dale Baumgartner 1:46:05
They'd have gotten nothing for their milk. And around here, it's so expensive to farm.
Jared Schmidt 1:46:10
D
D
D
D
D
Jared Schmidt 1:46:10
Mkay.
Dale Baumgartner 1:46:11
You don't have these big feed loss like you have over here in Idaho and California and that.
Jared Schmidt 1:46:16
Or back in the Midwest.
Dale Baumgartner 1:46:17
In Western Midwest.
Jared Schmidt 1:46:18
Yes.
Dale Baumgartner 1:46:19
You know, you have all, they have all these big round liquid tanks, manure tanks.
Jared Schmidt 1:46:23
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 1:46:23
And now you got to spread the manure out on the field when the weather's just right, you
know. We're under, these farmers are under DEQ spotlight.
Jared Schmidt 1:46:32
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 1:46:32
Big time! Because Tillamook is Portland, Salem, Eugene's playground.
D
D
D
D
D
Jared Schmidt 1:46:39
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 1:46:39
They come here for the weekends.
Jared Schmidt 1:46:41
Mhm, yeah!
Dale Baumgartner 1:46:42
They get, they come here, and then they complain about our farmers spreading manure on
their field and air smells like shit.
Jared Schmidt 1:46:51
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 1:46:51
Seriously, they're under the spotlight all the time.
Jared Schmidt 1:46:54
Yeah. I can believe that.
Dale Baumgartner 1:46:55
And it costs, it costs a lot more money. If you had a feedlot here.
Jared Schmidt 1:46:59
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 1:46:59
The cows would be buried, they would, they'd go out of sight in the wintertime in the mud.
D
D
D
D
D
Jared Schmidt 1:47:04
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 1:47:05
They'd sink! So they got to have indoor buildings for them.
Jared Schmidt 1:47:09
Right.
Dale Baumgartner 1:47:09
So,I mean, they would, if, if we were making commodity cheese, what's kept these farmers
alive is what we're making right here. This is what's kept these farmers alive here in Tillamook.
Period.
Jared Schmidt 1:47:22
And you're, and you're a part of that.
Dale Baumgartner 1:47:24
Absolutely.
Jared Schmidt 1:47:25
That's got to make you feel pretty proud.
Dale Baumgartner 1:47:27
Oh yeah. Yeah, I'm proud of what I did for Tillamook, that's for sure.
Jared Schmidt 1:47:30
Yeah.
D
D
D
D
Dale Baumgartner 1:47:31
You bet.
Jared Schmidt 1:47:31
What's your, what you're still doing, in a way with your legacy?
Dale Baumgartner 1:47:33
Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah.
Jared Schmidt 1:47:33
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 1:47:33
Yeah.
Jared Schmidt 1:47:37
Well then one final question for you today, Dale. This is gonna be hopefully a tough one. What's
your favorite cheese?
Dale Baumgartner 1:47:43
Oh, it's definitely right there [Points at the aged white cheddar].
Jared Schmidt 1:47:44
Oh wow, easy question, then!
Dale Baumgartner 1:47:46
Yeah, I like sharp cheese.
Jared Schmidt 1:47:49
The 17 -oldage one you brough.
D
D
D
D
D
Dale Baumgartner 1:47:50
And, you know, I think, I think, you know, I would go back and grade in the mornings with a
grading crew if I was in Tillamook. I wanted to go back and grade because I wanted to know
what you cheese, how the cheese was doing.
Jared Schmidt 1:48:03
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 1:48:04
You know, there's, three or four of them in the Grading Department. We usually,when we were
grading, you know, plugging everyone, they'd, they'd sample it, you know, and chew it, and
[imitates spitting], and they also had a bucket to spit in.
Jared Schmidt 1:48:23
Okay.
Dale Baumgartner 1:48:24
Believe me, I never spit in that bucket.
Jared Schmidt 1:48:27
Good.
Dale Baumgartner 1:48:28
I ate every piece of cheese I [Laughs] I ate every bit of it.
Jared Schmidt 1:48:33
That brings me to the question, like, how much, how many pounds of cheese do you think
you've eaten over the course of your life, then?
Dale Baumgartner 1:48:39
Oh man.
D
D
D
D
D
Jared Schmidt 1:48:39
[Laughs]
Dale Baumgartner 1:48:43
A lot. But, you know, I wanted to, you know. You know, the curds, the warm curds in the demo
vat, you know, just salting them, you know. And, you know, it's not necessarily...It was actually
a quality control deal. Wasn't really just simply, you're just eating cheese because you wanted
eat cheese.
Jared Schmidt 1:49:08
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 1:49:08
But, you know, we're making. Say we did that demo back this morning.
Jared Schmidt 1:49:12
Right.
Dale Baumgartner 1:49:13
And this is curd that's going to go out to retail.
Jared Schmidt 1:49:16
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 1:49:16
It's going to be sold to hundreds, and hundreds, and hundreds of tourists that are coming in out
there. You want to know what you're going to buy.
Jared Schmidt 1:49:24
Right.
D
D
D
D
Dale Baumgartner 1:49:25
You're done making a demo vat, you're salting the vat, putting it on and, you know several
applications, say it's three applications because you want to kind of work in, you don't want to
just throw it on there and hope it works in, and and...You know, in the end, you want to, you
want to taste, you know, them curds, so you know what retails getting here to sell to their
customers.
Jared Schmidt 1:49:49
Mhm, yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 1:49:50
I went down to Bandon once, there, and that was one of the, our CEO, at the time, was Harold
shields. And, "Boy Dale, whe we get this all ironed out and we take over Tillamook cheese, I
want you to go down there to Bandon and I want you to show [Pounds table] them how to make
real cheese! [Pounds table] Real cheese!" And, and, you know, I go down there and try to show
them how to make real cheese. It, you can't believe how hard it was.
Jared Schmidt 1:50:18
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 1:50:19
How hard it was to try to change what they were doing.
Jared Schmidt 1:50:24
Hmm.
Dale Baumgartner 1:50:26
"Here, I'm going to show you something here. Now, do this," and, you know, their cheese
turned out a lot better. They were so used to...I think it would be, it would be same as a
someone that has, say, was 50 years old and they have ate nothing but Kraft Cheese all their
life.
Jared Schmidt 1:50:45
Mhm.
D
D
D
D
Dale Baumgartner 1:50:46
Or Kraft singles, or something like that.
Jared Schmidt 1:50:49
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 1:50:49
Or commodity cheese. And then giving them a taste of this
Jared Schmidt 1:50:53
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 1:50:54
and trying to convert him to [Pounds table] you're not going to buy that anymore. You're going
to buy [Pounds table] nothing but Tillamook, and you're going to finish out the [Pounds table]
rest of your life eat quality cheese.
Jared Schmidt 1:51:03
[Laughs]
Dale Baumgartner 1:51:03
It's hard.
Jared Schmidt 1:51:04
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 1:51:05
It's actually hard.
D
D
D
D
D
Jared Schmidt 1:51:06
Right.
Dale Baumgartner 1:51:06
And he was amazing. I remember going down there and making, they had a little visitor center,
right here on Highway 101, right in Bandon. And I said, "We're gonna make some good curds
today. We're gonna make some curds today that these customers are just gonna..."
Jared Schmidt 1:51:22
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 1:51:23
And we made up into the vat there. We got them all salted, we took them out to a little retail
center, and there was two, three gals out there, you know, and they're gonna package it up
and put it up for sale. It wasn't ten minutes later here, here they come, pushing that cart with
all that curd.
Jared Schmidt 1:51:39
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 1:51:40
What's this shit?
Jared Schmidt 1:51:42
Hmm.
Dale Baumgartner 1:51:44
They were so used to old crummy curds,
Jared Schmidt 1:51:48
Yeah.
D
D
D
D
Dale Baumgartner 1:51:48
that they didn't know what really good curds tasted like.
Jared Schmidt 1:51:51
Really?
Dale Baumgartner 1:51:51
They actually brought it back. We took them tubs, dumped it back into vat, overcooked it,
ruined it, and get it back out there and they were happy. [Both laugh] Just exactly what we did.
We just put it right back into the vat, turned the heat on, ruined it, and sent it back out there
and they were happy. I couldn't believe it. [Laughs] You don't even know what real good curds
are.
Jared Schmidt 1:52:18
As somebody who used to work at a microbrewery, I get that. Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 1:52:23
Oh, yeah, yeah...I've been up to Pike Place up there in Seattle. You know, I mean, all over. I've
been all over. You know, I've been to cheese factories over in England, and Denmark, and New
Zealand, and everywhere. Yeah, I, as far as, as far as, you know, I think one of the things I was
always really proud of there at Tillamook was, was how darn clean we kept the plant all the
time, too. Yeah.
Jared Schmidt 1:52:23
Yeah Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 1:52:54
And, you know, it'd be...I would have to contribute that to the visitor center.
Jared Schmidt 1:52:59
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 1:52:59
You know, it's showcase. And, you know, we don't want, we don't want curds or anything on the
D
D
D
D
D
You know, it's showcase. And, you know, we don't want, we don't want curds or anything on the
floor. We want to, if there's something that gets on the floor,and whatnot, with, "Hey, we got to
get it cleaned up, here."
Jared Schmidt 1:53:15
Yeah. Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 1:53:16
We're not gonna leave it there till tonight to clean up so tourists can see it. We're gonna do it.
And, you know, we took that, I took that philosophy to Boardman, Boardman One and
Boardman too, "Hey, get this cleaned up. Don't leave it just set here. I don't care if there are no
tourists or not." I think, you know, I mean it, in the cheesemaking industry, it ties into the
quality cheese.
Jared Schmidt 1:53:38
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 1:53:38
Something on the floor, it's the bacteria, the, what we call a phage in the air that will actually
attack, will actually attack our starter cultures.
Jared Schmidt 1:53:49
Huh.
Dale Baumgartner 1:53:49
And they can actually effect, the effect of cheese. So, it's something I've always been proud of,
is how clean we've kept all of our plants all the time.
Jared Schmidt 1:53:59
That's cool.
Dale Baumgartner 1:54:00
That needed to happen, that needed to happen. I, I came from the Hebo Cheese Factory. We
didn't even have a hose to hose floor down. [Jared laughs through his nose] The end of the
D
D
D
D
didn't even have a hose to hose floor down. [Jared laughs through his nose] The end of the
night, we turned the hot water on full bore on the double, big, great,big old double sink.
Jared Schmidt 1:54:15
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 1:54:15
And we'd all grab five gallon buckets to start at one end. And this is how we did the floor.
Jared Schmidt 1:54:20
[Laughs] [ILL]
Dale Baumgartner 1:54:20
You know, and then, you know, I think the friendliness of your plant really ties into how, your
quality of cheese, that's all there is to it.
Jared Schmidt 1:54:30
Kind of sets the tone.
Dale Baumgartner 1:54:31
Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely.
Jared Schmidt 1:54:34
Yeah. And if people want to buy it, because they see it clean.
Dale Baumgartner 1:54:35
Yeah, yeah. I mean if they're looking into windows and they're just seeing nothing but a mess.
You know, why would they go down here and buy a piece of Tillamook cheese before they go
out the door?
Jared Schmidt 1:54:45
Yeah.
D
D
D
D
Dale Baumgartner 1:54:45
You know, if they see a nice, really clean plant. The overhead pipes are all nice and clean.
Jared Schmidt 1:54:51
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 1:54:51
And everybody out on the floor. You know, we, we actually went to uniforms, I don't know, you
know, we used to just wear white.
Jared Schmidt 1:55:02
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 1:55:04
For years and years we wore whites. And then we went to uniforms, just because, you know,
some people just don't want to wash their clothes as often as others. You know what I mean?
Jared Schmidt 1:55:17
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 1:55:17
And holy T-shirts, or holy shirts and this. It was just, it was good we went to uniforms and
Jared Schmidt 1:55:23
Right.
Dale Baumgartner 1:55:25
that really, really helped, you know.
Jared Schmidt 1:55:27
D
D
D
D
D
Jared Schmidt 1:55:27
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 1:55:27
That made a big difference, you know,
Jared Schmidt 1:55:29
Like seeing a doctor in a white, in a white coat, kind of situation. That idea of clean and
authority.
Dale Baumgartner 1:55:33
Yeah, yeah, yeah. And,you know, I mean, if a guy has, a guy has dogs or cats at home, and
they're all over your furniture. Now you've got hair all over your white pants or your white shirt.
Now you come into cheese factory to make cheese.
Jared Schmidt 1:55:46
And I wouldn't know how that goes at all. We have white couches and a black lab, so...[Laughs]
Dale Baumgartner 1:55:51
I can show you, and, you know, another one that, another interesting one was. We were over at
the Boardman plant, there, in 2001. And we were working over there and, you know, I mean, I
knew people all over, you know, in the cheese industry. And uh, Idaho Milk Processors... You
know, they have their big convention up there, Sun Valley, Idaho, every year, you know, every
summer. I got a call from a guy over there. Anyways, "Hey," he says, "John Laniganfrom
Glanbia," they, you know, they had just got to doing a bunch of work for us, you know, making
a bunch of cheese for us.
Jared Schmidt 1:56:11
Mhm. Okay.
Dale Baumgartner 1:56:34
"Hi. Hey, they win the grand champion here every year, every year it's the same thing! John
Lanigan wins that Grand Champion every year. Why don't you send some cheese over here!
Send some cheese over to the contest will ya?"
D
D
D
D
Jared Schmidt 1:56:48
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 1:56:48
And I sent a, I sent some sharp cheese over there. And won grand champion [Laughs. That's
the only time I ever sent cheese. [Laughs]
Jared Schmidt 1:57:00
They didn't invite you back?
Dale Baumgartner 1:57:01
[Laughs] How took Grand Champion gold watching the whole works [Laughs]
Jared Schmidt 1:57:07
Nice! That's fun. Congratulations.
Dale Baumgartner 1:57:12
Yeah.
Jared Schmidt 1:57:12
They didn't want to set up a dynasty of you winning every year then, huh?
Dale Baumgartner 1:57:17
[Laughs]. Nah. You, you just, you know, the milk quality, throughout, say the Northwest
California.
Jared Schmidt 1:57:26
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 1:57:27
California their quality of milk has just never been, they just they can't even make aged
D
D
D
D
D
California their quality of milk has just never been, they just they can't even make aged
cheddar down there.
Jared Schmidt 1:57:34
Okay.
Dale Baumgartner 1:57:35
That's just, it's just almost out of the question.
Jared Schmidt 1:57:37
Okay.
Dale Baumgartner 1:57:37
And you know [Clears throat] Christmas City, California, there...You know, they, I've taken
cheese down there, boy, you know, "Oh, if you're coming down, bring some sharp cheese down
with you." You know, same way with Glambia hey, I can, I can take sharp cheese just about
anywhere.
Jared Schmidt 1:58:03
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 1:58:03
And I mean to tell you, there's gonna be just a big old hug.
Jared Schmidt 1:58:07
Yeah, yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 1:58:09
It's just, it's just, you know, Romianos, they just, they just, they just love it when I show up. I, in
fact, I went down there right after I retired, I went down there and took a whole bunch of
cheese. God, never just pumped. You know?
Jared Schmidt 1:58:23
D
D
D
D
Jared Schmidt 1:58:23
[Laughs]
Dale Baumgartner 1:58:23
It's amazing, when you show up with a nice aged cheese. People just don't get it and
people...It's hard to, it's hard to make.
Jared Schmidt 1:58:32
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 1:58:33
It's expensive to make...You know, it costs a lot of money to store millions and millions and
millions of pounds of cheese to age, you know. It cost money and it runs, that's why Tillamook
Cheese, you know, it's more expensive because people just don't realize what it costs to store
cheese at a certain temperature and
Jared Schmidt 1:58:41
Yeah. Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 1:58:52
and store, you know. You know, you paid for the milk. It's just nothing but huge money setting
in the cold storage area. You know, it millions of pounds of cheese. It's costing a lot of, you
know, it may only be a couple pennies a pound a month, but it, it all adds up when you're
talking millions of pounds.
Jared Schmidt 1:59:15
Yeah. Yeah, I believe that. Well, that is all I have for right now, Dale. Do you have any, we can
pause and we can always come back and do another interview which I would love to do.
Dale Baumgartner 1:59:27
Mhm.
Jared Schmidt 1:59:27
Do you anything else before I turn off the recorder?
D
D
D
D
Do you anything else before I turn off the recorder?
Dale Baumgartner 1:59:33
I'm sure, you know, we could go on for days here with no problem.
Jared Schmidt 1:59:36
Don't, don't tempt me.
Dale Baumgartner 1:59:37
[Laughs]
Jared Schmidt 1:59:39
We will have to one of these.
Dale Baumgartner 1:59:41
Yeah, yeah, no, I'm fine. I'm fine. I can show you how we made babies off back in the '70s, so,
here in a little bit.
Jared Schmidt 1:59:48
I'd like that.
Dale Baumgartner 1:59:49
Yeah.
Jared Schmidt 1:59:49
Sounds good. Well with that, I'll, thank you Dale, and I'll stop it right here then.
D
D
D
D
