I WAS FORCED ON BOARD TO SERVE MY KINGEarly, early in the spring,[I?] was forced on board
to serve my KingA-leaving of my dear behindWho loved and set her heart towards mine.As she
lay smiling in my armsI thought she had ten thousand charmsWelcomes a man and kissed her
sweetSaying: We'll get married next time we meet.As I went sailing over the seaI took an opportunityI
wrote aletter to the dearest dearBut nothing from her could I hear.I went unto her father's hallAnd
for my dearest love did call,He answered me in this reply,My daughter is married and you must
be denied.O then I asked him what did he mean,He answered me all in her name,My daughter
daughter/is married for a richer life,She's left you to choose you another wife.O now I've lost my
golden crown,I'll roam the sea all around and around,I'll seek a deck where the bullets fly,I'll roam the
sea till the day I die.O Willie dear, do stay on shore,Don't roam the raging / sea [any?] more,There is
girls in the town that is fair as I,Don't go where the waves and the bullets fly.I'll go where the drum
and the fife does playIt's never ceasing night nor day,I'd rather be on the raging seaThan to be in
a false girl's company.O cursed is gold and silver too,And all fair maids who won't prove true,[I'm?]
when their own dear promises break,And marry another for richer's sake Ben Rice[Cox?]I was cast
