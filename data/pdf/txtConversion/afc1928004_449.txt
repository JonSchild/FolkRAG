ARISTOCRATIC NIG-S. 
Written expressly for TIIE FERGUSONS, by A L. H ORTON. 
W E are two aristocratic figs from Alabama, 
And the white folks call us Pomp and Sammie, 
And the yellow gals say that we're quite dandy, 
And dear old Alabama that's our home. 
When massa put us on the old plantation, 
We was so gay and very captivating, 
That the yellow gals' hearts we kept a-breaking, 
Did those aristocratic figs from Alabama ; 
For 0 
you see, we're always gay, 
(
Break.) 
Singing, dancing all the day. 
(
Break.) 
CHORUS. 
Yes, we are always gay, 
No matter where we roam, 
And we're going back again, 
To our Alabama home. 
(Dance.) 
At night, when old mossa he is sleeping, 
And the pretty liltle stars are a-peeping ; 
Down the green lanes you will find us creeping, 
To sing and dance with the gals of Alabama ; 
But now, kind friends, as we will have to leave you 
We'll go back home ; we hope it will not grieve yol 
For we have done our best to try and please you, 
Has these aristocratic figs from Alabama ; 
For, 0 
you see, we're always gay, 
(
Break.) 
Singing, dancing all the day. 
(
BPeak.) 
Yes, we are, etc. 
LOVE. 
Composed by HARRY BENNETT, and sung with success by BILLY 
CARTER. 
Oh, love is such a 
very funny thing, 
And it catches the young and the old, 
It's just like a 
plate of boarding house hash, 
And many a 
man it has sold! 
It makes you feel like a 
fresh water eel, 
And causes your head to swell ; 
You lose your mind, for love is blind, 
And it empties your pocket book as well. 
CHORUS. 
Boys keep away from the gals, I 
say, 
Give them lots of room, 
Or you'll find when you're wed, 
They will bang you till you're dead 
With bald headed end of a 
broom. 
When a 
man is gone on a 
pretty little gal, 
He talks just as gentle as a 
dove; 
lie spends all his money, and calls her his honey, 
For to show her he is solid on his love. 
When Ins money is gone and his clothes in hock, 
lie finds the old saying it is true, 
That a 
mole on the arm is worth two on the leg, 
But what is he going for to do. 
Boys keep away, etc, 
When married folks have lots of cash, 
Their love is firm and strong, 
But when they have to feed on hash, 
Their love don't last so long. 
With a 
wife and seventeen half starved kids, 
I 
tell you it's no fun, 
When your butcher comes around to collect his bill, 
With a 
dog and a 
double barrel gun. 
Boys keep away, etc, 
Young fellows just take my advice, 
Don't be in a 
hurry for to wed, 
You think you're in clover till the honey- moon's over, 
And then you'll think you're dead. 
With a 
cross eyed baby on each knee, 
And a 
wife with a 
plaster on her nose, 
You'll find true love don't run so very smooth, 
When you have to wear your second hand cloths. 
Boys keep away, etc. 
When the rent is high, and the kids all cry 
Because there's no grub to ehaw, 
You'll holler for your son 
To load up your gun, 
While you vaccinate mother-in-law. 
CIRCUS DIFFICULTIES. 
Irish Song, composed by T. 
FERGUSON. 
AIR.—" Irish Candidate.' 
A 
GOOD morning to you all, 
We come in to make a 
call, 
To tell you of the troubles we have seen. 
We're a 
couple of circus men ; 
To the north pole we have been, 
But our salary was so high they made us fall. 
When we joined the circus band, 
We was the greatest in the land ; 
We had dimmed pins and smoked the best cigars, 
And the ladies used to say, 
0 
their hearts would give away; 
They're the daisies on the horizontal bars. 
CHORUS. 
We can turn a 
double somersault, 
A flip-flap, or a 
front, 
"We can leap the horses forty, 
It is queer how we do so, 
Iteis all nerve, and if you will observe, 
We have got the knack of standing on our ear. 
(Dance.) 
0 we're going to get a 
job 
With the circus in the spring, 
For to carry the centre pole from town to town; 
We can ride around the ring, 
And so gaily can we sing ; 
We can caper up as cute as any clown ; 
We can act on the trapeze, 
Do a 
twister from our knees. 
0 I 
tell you we have got an awful gall; 
For to see us on the bars, 
We're as handsome as the stars, 
0 we think that we can paralyze them all. 
CHORUS. 
0 
get on to our nobby style, 
We are happy all the while; 
We're the brothers to the man from Donegan ; 
But we'll leave you for awhile, 
Till we go and get a 
smile, 
We'll come back again and do a 
funny fall. 
(Dance.)

THAR'S A HAPPY LITTLE HOME. 
Words by nanny BENNETT. 
Music by HARRY WPODSON. 
Titan's a 
happy little home, 
Down in Southern Tennessee, 
Whar the ivy blossoms twine around the door; 
And forever fresh and green 
In my memory it will be, 
ThoughI know I'll never see it any more ; 
But I 
never can forget the home I 
love so well, 
And the many good old tunes that I 
have sung; 
And the tears they fill my eyes every time I 
try to tell 
Of the times I 
used to have when I 
was young. 
CIIORUS. 
Now the tambo and the bones are forever laid away, 
The fiddle and the banjo am unstrung, 
But I 
often heave a 
sigh for the happy days gone by, 
And the times I 
used, to have when I 
was young. 
When the autumn days lvd come, 
I 
would husk the yellow corn, 
In the field I 
was singing all the day, 
And before they made me free, 
I 
had. never cause to mourn ; 
And around the old. place everything was gay, 
And many, many a 
time, when the work of day was o'er, 
With my melody the old plantation rung ; 
And my heart does often long for the happy days of yore, 
And the times I 
used to have when I 
was young. 
Now the tambo, etc. 
THE FATHER OF THAT AWFUL lifARY ANN. 
Original Irish Song, written by TERRY FERGUSON. 
I SUPPOSE you've all heard of Mary Ann, 
-Who has the great edication ; 
Well, I'm her father, Dinnis, 
And of that there's no dictation. 
I 
brought her up ; ' twas at a 
great expense 
Of a 
hundred thousand dollars, 
And now she has a 
piano, 
And forty thousand scollars ; 
And the way she plays ' twould break your heart I'm 
sure. 
(Break.) 
Her style and grace is something to adore ; (Break.) 
But I'll love and cherish her through life, 
As long as she can earn a 
dollar: 
At the piano she'll set all day, 
And this is what she'll holler ? 
CHORUS. 
She's a 
darling, she's a 
daisy, 
She's a 
dumplin', she's a 
lamb ; 
You should see her play on the piano, 
Such an edieation has my Mary Ann. (
Repeat.) 
There's a 
spalpeen by the name of Billie Malone, 
Who comes to court my daughter, 
When there all alone, at Dudley's Grove 
It's most to death he'll talk her ; 
He tells her that his mother is a 
king, 
And with all such talk he will stuff her ; 
But if I 
lay my hands on him, 
I'll paralyze that young duffer, 
For away they galavant, and they say tra-la-lo, 
(Break.) 
Skip the gutter, Charley, for you are very fleet. 
(Break.) 
But I'll love and cherish her through life, 
As long as she can earn a 
dollar ; 
At the piano she'll set all day, 
And this is what she'll holler : 
She's a 
darling, etc.

OH! MOSES. 
Sung by FitANK Bunt. 
Ant—" Whoa, Emma." 
O NE day I 
had, a 
thought, 
A 
little yacht I 
bought 
To take my family down to Coney Isle 
But as I 
neared the beach, 
A 
gang began to screech, 
But I 
did only turn around and smile. 
SPOKEN.—Yes, I 
didn't mind the boys, but just as we 
were making for a 
hotel, I 
heard them all holler out --
CHORUS. 
Oh ! Moses, oh! Moses! 
Look at them sheenies, 
Oh ! ain't they got noses, 
Oh! Moses, oh ! Moses. 
Dot's what they cry at me morning and night. 
My wife felt very bad, 
And said dose boys are mad, 
And asked me if I 
could the reason tell ; 
I 
said I 
did not know, 
But home we'd better go, 
And as we started they began to yell: 
Oh ! Moses, etc. 
We got into ft boat, 
And when we were afloat, 
A 
rotten goose-egg hit me in the eye ; 
It spoilt my bran new clothes, 
And stuffed up all my nose, 
And then to make it worse they all did cry : 
Oh ! Moses, etc. 
BEHIND THE SCENES. 
AIR.—" My Love Nell." 
Written by TERRY D. 
FERGUSON, for my biother JAMES 
FERGUSON. 
Now a 
funny little song I 
am going for to sing, 
And I 
hope you will say it is well ; 
It's about young girls that you meet on the stage, 
It's many a 
man they sell ; 
They call you a 
gawk, and a 
funny little guy, 
And say you are in your teens. 
And they all do laugh, and say they got great graft', 
When they get you behind the scenes. 
CHORES. 
For the wine runs high, and your pocket runs low, 
And they call you a 
gawk and a 
green, 
You'll wish you were out or walking round about, 
Instead of behind the scenes. 
Now I 
went to the show the other night, 
When a 
charming little girl so fair 
Come out on the stage to do a 
song and dance, 
And upon me she did stare ; 
She winked at me as she danced around, 
And as strange as it may seem, 
She roped me in like the rest of the gawks, 
And got me behind the scenes. 
For the wine runs high, etc. 
Now, says I 
to her, do you look here, 
What kind of a 
place is this, 
To rope a 
man in and talk to him sweet, 
And charge him five dollars for a 
kiss ; 
But she only looked and gave inc the laugh, 
And said it was a 
sin, 
But I 
was a 
gawk, she knew by my talk, 
To allow her to rope me in. 
CHORUS. 
So I 
was very glad to get out wid my life, 
And enough to get a 
plate of beans, 
And I 
swore with all my might, 
I 
would never more get tight, 
And be roped behind the scenes.

TIIE BRIAR. 
SONG AND DANCE. 
D OWN by a 
little running brook, 
Where berries sweetest grow, 
Dere lives de only girl I 
love, 
Miss ' Liza Jane, my beau. 
'Twas in among de bushes, 
De first time I 
espied her ; 
She cried aloud, oh, darkey, come, 
And pull out dig yer briar ! 
CHORUS. 
Oh, darkey, don't you linger dere, 
Lord, I 
shall expire ! 
Come help dig bleeding finger, 
And subtract away de briar. 
I 
grabbed dig fainting fair one, 
Right by her little thumb, 
And pulled de thorny dagger out, 
Like 'possum from de gum. 
De more I 
kissed de finger, 
De more it seemed to heal, 
And when I 
kissed her two lips, oh, 
How happy she did feel ! 
Oh, darkey, etc. 
I 
courted sweet Miss 'Liza Jane, 
And well I 
played my part ; 
I 
says subtract de briar out 
Dat's sticking in my heart ; 
I 
took her to the parson's, 
Wid hymen's knot to tie her ; 
Our lives hab been as berries 
Since, widout a 
single briar. 
Oh, darkey, etc.

Its music speaks of other days, 
And makes me long to die. — Cho.

I'll lay me down to die alone, 
Beneath this old pine tree; 
For all the joys that once were mine, 
Have fled away from me: 
My dear old wife, and children, too, 
They died so long ago: 
I 
know that they are waiting me, 
Beside the heaVilly do'. — Cho.

I've weeded out my troubles here, 
And hoed my row of life, 
And now I'm going far away 
To join my darling wife: 
The massa's sending angels bright 
To set my spirit free. 
Ana soon this body will grow cold, 
Beneath this old pine tree.—Cho. 
CRUEL GAL. 
(BANJO SOLO.) 
By HARRY W ATSON, of W ATSON 86 ELLIS. 
Behold a 
poor deluded young man, 
With his cheeks besmeared with tears, tears, tears, 
Through the affections of one I 
loved, 
And courted for many long years. 
I 
treated her to ice cream and wine, 
But soon came the day of my woes, 
Oh, she fell in love with another sardine— 
He was a 
man with a 
wart on his nose! 
Oh, the cause of my agitation was 
A 
fellow that walked the tight rope, rope, rope, 
He wrote a 
letter to my false one, 
Asking her to elope! 
She sent him a 
lock of her blue red hair, 
And said she'd be his darling rose; 
With a 
big butcher knife I 
swore revenge, 
On the man with a 
wart on his nose. 
One night he made me feel very jealous, 
lie announced on his rope would walk, walk, walk; 
So I 
resolved to put an end to his life, 
By playing a 
trick with his chalk. 
So I 
greased his rope with a 
tallow candle, 
And smiled as he walked on his toes; 
Ile slipped and fell on a 
big brick bat, 
And busted the wart on his nose. 
Oh, they bathed his head in kerosene oil, 
But no sign of life did he make! 
So I 
resolved to speak to my rose once more, 
But bravely she gave Inc the shake, shake, shake, 
So in sad despair I 
wander, 
My heart for some one to dispnse, 
My Rosey keeps as a 
relic in a 
little alcohol, 
That wart T 
knocked elf! 
nose. 
The boy I'm going to sing about, 
He is a 
son of mine 
He's working in a 
clothing store, 
They use him for a 
sign; 
He looks the image of myself, 
Although he's not so stout, 
And I 
use him for a 
walking stick 
Whenever I 
go out. 
CHORUS. 
My son Moses, he is the boy, 
I 
dress him like a 
five cent toy, 
And you know my only joy 
Is my son Moses. 
My Mosey is a 
tough young man, 
He wears his hair like me, 
His nose and chin they both do meet, 
And he looks like a 
Chinee. 
The girls they call him Darling Mose, 
For he dresses up so fine, 
And he says he'll.put me in his place, 
For I'd make a 
better sign. 
My son Moses, eta 
Written by HARRY BENNETT, the Rotterdam Comedian. 
THERE are many curious titles 
For the ballads of the day, 
Such as " Kiss me once, dear mother," 
" 
Little Tommy's gone astray ;" 
But I've found some new and sparkling, 
Which I'll warble while I'm here, 
They are full of grief and pathos, 
And may draw a 
silent tear. 
CHORUS. 
Now prepare to hear my card, 
It will cause your hearts to throb; 
I 
will chirrup slowly, softly--
Do not be ashamed to sob. 
Papa's chest-protector's faded, 
Throwing freckles at the breeze, 
He had seltzer on his ulster, 
Let me sniff the fragrant cheese ; 
Little Willie's tombstone's mortgaged, 
Sister's gum is in the hash, 
He had pimples on his duster, 
Let me hear the lightning flash. 
Now prepare, etc. 
TITLE 
S.—Concluded. 
There's a 
prize in every doughnut, 
Come and lean upon the ice, 
Do not waltz on Eva's chignon, 
Throwing turkeys for the dice; 
Papa's hair is getting mouldy, 
When dew is on the lake, 
Give my last year's clothes to brother. 
When I'm chilly let me shake. 
Now prepare, 
Who has spit in auntie's slipper ? 
Darling Kitty's hair's decayed, 
Let me hear that sweet hand-organ, 
Coaxing sunshine in the shade ; 
When I'm bathing in the treetops, 
Sprinkling ginger on the sea, 
Papa will you leave off boozing ? 
Save one little club for me. 
Now prepare, 
Let me die among the oysters, 
There are scars upon his hair, 
Writing monograms in lager, 
Do not harm the grizzly bear ; 
What is home without a 
doorknob ? 
When thy nose begins to blush, 
Soothing bedbugs in the moonlight, 
Bury me beneath the slush. 
Now prepare, etc. 
Good evening, neighbors all, I've come to make a 
call, 
I'm going to give you all a 
little warning. 
T 
haven't been this way for a 
week or so to- day, 
And now I've come to see my little darling. 
She's the sweetest ever seen, with her flounces trimmed in 
green. 
She's the primrose of Ireland, and her age is seventeen. 
It will be on next Sunday night when I 
wed that little queen. 
And I'm going to give you all an invitation. 
CHORUS. 
We will dance (
sym.), and we will sing (
sym.), 
And we will raise the very divil in the nation. 
Now, laddies, don't you fail, we will have a 
keg of ale 
When I 
celebrate my Irish invitation. 
How happy I 
will be, when my Mary marries me, 
Then I 
will drive away all care and ag,gravation, 
Happy as the days are long, I 
will sing a 
little song, 
And I'll be the happiest man in all the nation; 
I 
will give a 
hearty cheer, and I'll take my glass of beer, 
I 
will drive away all trouble when I 
wed my little dear. 
Now don't forget to come, for I'm sure we'll have some fun, 
When I 
celebrate my Irish invitation. 
I 
keep a 
store down in Chatham Square,— 
If you wish to buy, I 
hope you'll come there ; 
My goods are all cheap, and I'll warrant them tine— 
You can't miss the place, for my name's on the sign. 
Some men come in there and think that I 
cheat, 
But I 
bet you I 
keep the best place in the street; 
I 
sell pills and needles and washtubs and beetles. 
My store is the best, and my goods can't be beat. 
Isaac's my name and my number is twenty— 
Don't think I 
can't suit, for you know I 
got plenty ; 
Come right in my store, it's the best in the country, 
And if you want goods, why, just give me a 
call. 
I've coats and I've pants and vests by the score, 
I 
have a 
wash line full outside of my door; 
Don't say I 
can't suit you, for it's very plain, 
If you trade there once, you will trade there again. 
I'll sell you a 
coat for a 
dollar or two; 
Don't think that I 
beat because I'm a 
Jew. 
The goods that I 
deal in, don't think that I 
steal them. 
So hellup me gracious, they're all bran new.

SUCH A CONSTITUTION HAS MY BROTHER 
JOHN, 
Words by C. R FiSliEll. 
Sung by HARRY KERNELL. 
M Y 
brother John's so verdant, you can hear him ev'ry 
day 
Talk about his morals and his strength ; 
He thinks he's trim as Talmage, for schooners he can 
pray, 
He can struggle with smoke herring any length. 
He can snore up all the Murphies, set you 17:Whig with a 
song, 
And make you sick as garlic with a 
yarn. 
His jokes are like a 
bottle—the right cork put in wrong, 
Such a 
constitution has my brother John ! 
enollus. 
He is " nervy," " topsy-turvy," 
As sprucoly handsome as an empty barn ; 
And to see him dance, would make a " muleass " prance, 
Such a 
constitution has my brother John ! 
By his face you see he's German, his features are so 
li'igl it, 
He can raise an iron boiler without help, 
His nose collies in for -whiskey, he smells it without 
light, 
He can make a 
bound for Brooklyn with a 
yelp. 
Though he cannot play piano, he can play his landlord 
cheap, 
And evade his washing programme by a 
yarn. 
If you request a 
little debt, he'll hum you sound asleep, 
Such a 
constitution has my brother John ! 
CHORUS. 
He's a " bracer," pea-soup chaser, 
And for gratis smokes he does not care a 
darn ; 
He can roam all night, in the morning fight, 
Such a 
constitution lrxi my brother John !

I

Or dream those dreams again !

AIR—" The Day I 
Played Base Ball." 
My name is Isaac Moses, 
Pm a 
man that sells old clotheses, 
I 
keep a 
store in Baxter Street, 
One hundred and fifty-four; 
But the loafers that hangs out round there, 
They tease me and they pull my hair, 
And the other night they cline in there, 
And tried to rob my store. 
An Irishman called Pat McCann, 
He was a 
lazy Irishman, 
lie grabbed me by the collar, 
And he threw me on the floor. 
They stole from me my coats and pants, 
And knocked me nearly in a 
trance, 
And on my counter they did dance, 
The night they robbed my store. 
"Police!" and " Murder!" I 
cried out, 
When some one struck me in the mouth, 
And then they all kicked me about, 
And dung me through the door; 
Both of my eyes were black and blue— 
Believe me what I 
say is true— 
They dragged me away up to Bellevue 
The night they robbed my store. 
SINCE MICHAEL LEARNED TO DANCE. 
Sung by JOHN KERNELL. 
My name it is O'Donovan, 
I 
live in Jersey City, 
I 
have three boys, and four big girls. 
On me they have no pity ; 
My eldest boy's about nineteen, 
lie sings a 
song called " Dancing on the Green," 
Not a 
day's luck in the house is seen 
Since Michael learned to dance. 
He has all the boys and girls taught 
To waltz around upon their toes ; 
He practised kicking yesterday noon, 
And busted all his clothes ; 
He comes from the theatre about daylight, 
And says with the actors he had a 
terrible fight, 
The house is a 
circus from morn till night, 
Since Michael learned to dance. 
He brought home stuff he called burnt cork, 
Which he says he got at the play halls ; 
Ho broke the clock, 
Trying to stand on his head ; 
While he done some funny falls ; 
As an actor Ile SfryS lie's great, 
My family to Hoboken must emigrate, 
Since :Michael learned to dance. 
He calls his sister a 
leading lady, 
lie wrote a 
drama, called the " Stolen Cheese," 
He played a 
year at Sing Sing, 
Doing a 
cornet solo upon a 
high trapeze; 
The manager told him to write again, 
He doubled up with Geo. Francis Train, 
Begorra, I 
have water on the brain, 
Since Michael learned to dance.

She bothered him daily while lie was at work. 
Oh, this gal she would watch him and on him keep an eye, 
She swore she would have him or with him she'd die ; 
When she went to embrace him he'd yelp loud and strong. 
Get thee gone, girl, get thee gone, girl; 
• 
But the girl wouldn't get thee gone. 
Oh, she tortured him hourly and stuck just like glue, 
He wasted away and his clothes he fell through. 
He rented a 
barnyard and slept in the shed, 
e
l'  And this girl she hung till his reason had fled. 
Now she'd crawled thro' a 
knot hole and roost by his side, 
., 
With a 
hank of blue ribbon his ankles she tied, 
• 
When be awoke from his slumbers like a 
hero did say, 
Get thee away, girl, get thee away, girl, 
But the girl wouldn't get thee away. 
Oh, she followed him around, and one evening he died, 
He opened his mug and he let his breath slide, 
In an alley way they have laid him to take his last sleep, 
Where the tom cats do fight and the bull dogs do eat. 
Oh, she dressed herself up in a 
new Sunday coat, 
With some whitewash his age On a 
shovel she wrote, 
Now she gets boiling full, and the boys all do shout, 
Get thee out, girl, get thee out, girl, 
But the girl don't get thee out.

HER FRONT NAME IS HANNER. 
As sung by LARRY TooLET. 
The heart in my bosom has lately been stolen, 
By a 
sweet blushing maiden. just nineteen years old; 
She's half Irish, blonde, and likes pork and beans, 
He feet are a 
feature—she wears seventeens. 
Cuortus. 
Her front name is Harmer, 
Her father's a 
tanner, 
Him she does hammer, 
In an artistic manner; 
She sings ". Star Spangled Banner," 
And " A Lean Banana." 
With tooth brush I 
fan her, 
When she thumps the pianner. 
She wears a 
moire antique pull back, cost six cents a 
yard. 
Her hat and parasol are made out of lard; 
She shall be a 
lady, like Judy O'Grady, 
For I've wealth (to get) and will keep it shady. 
Her front name, etc. 
Her mouth—well, it stretches from ear to ear.. 
Whenever it's open I'm afraid to go near. 
Whenever she talks I'm never around, 
For I'm sure I'd fall in, and I 
know I'd get drowned. 
Her front name, etc.

GOOD-EVENING, friends, I'm Solomon Bulenrisky,

At glass puteen, yon bet I 
can't be beat. 
My route is right through Ludlow to the Bowery, 
And. from the Bowery down to Avenue A, 
When the loafers on the corner do insult me 
I 
only turn around to them and. say 
CHORUS. 
Butsky (

They're Irish and. they don't know what I

That's the only way I

For I

ow the other day a 
loafer on the corner, 
Come up and asked me if I 
was alive, 
And with a 
dub he hit me on the shoulder, 
And for the nearest store I 
made a 
dive. 
The man that owned the store he chased me quickly, 
And -with his fist he hit me in the eye, 
Then I 
told him for to nemt, a, missamashinna, 
And at the dirty loafers I 
did cry— 
Butsky, (

Now another loafer standing on the corner, 
Says there's going to be a 
big wind out to- day ; 
You better strap your business to a 
lamppost, 
And hold on or you will both get blowed away. 
He said. he knew a 
place they wanted monkeys, 
To carry signs .for sixty cents a 
day, 
And I 
asked him then, why he was not a 
working, 
And I 
nearly drove him mad when I 
did say—

THE ISLE DE BLACKWELL. 
i3nng by HARRIGAN ck: HART in EDWARD Il_kRRIGAN'E; great burlesque. 
the " Celebrated Hard Case." 
Come gather ye cracksmen 
And ganiifs so fly, 
Maces and braces, 
Shoplifters draw nigh. 
I'll warble a 
ditty, 
While the chorus you swell. 
Of the blokes doing time 
On the Isle de lifackwell. 
CuoutTs. 
With my one, two, and three four, 
Then all in a 
line. 
To the shoe shop and quarry 
Each bloke must keep time. 
We work like a 
Turk, 
Then back to our cell, 
Such a 
grand institution 
Is the Isle de Blackwell. 
Oh, there is a 
d : rung 
Who'd sugar galore, 
He hypothecated to 
The Canada shore. 
The boodle was heavy, 
He tripped and fell, 
Singing Moody and Sankey 
On the Isle de Blackwell! 
With my one, two, eta. 
Oh, there is a 
baby, 
'Tis a 
pity he's here, 
He was nabbed by a 
hipper 
A-shoving the queer. 
His people are nobby, 
On the Avenue they swell, 
He's a 
family skeleton 
On the Isle de Blackwell. 
With my one, two, etc.. 
There's Scotty, our keeper, 
We all know his afoot, 
He collars the old togs 
Then hands out a 
suit 
Striped like a 
zebra 
Then it's good-bye. farewell, 
We're regular boarders 
On the Isle de Black well. 
With my one, two, etc. 
DOWN WHERE THE WATER LILIES GROW. 
Sung with great success by Miss CArnun Dmga,tig at TONY PASTOR'S 
Theatre. 
"fwAs in the pleasant summer time 
I 
met him all by chance, 
The robins sang their sweetest rhyme, 
And loving was their glance ; 
We wandered 'midst the blooming flowers, 
He called me sweet -find fair, 
The queen of all the sunny bowers, 
The brightest rosebud there. 
SPOKEN.—Oh, he was such a 
charming, such a 
delight-
ful young fellow, that I 
never can forget : 
CHORUS. 
When we met there by the river 
In the sunlight's merry glow, 
For my heart he won forever 
Down where the water lilies grow. 
He whispered words of fond delight, 
The birds they listened, too ; 
We wandered till the stars at night 
Shone out in sky so blue ; 
When arm in arm we wandered on, 
Way down the lonely lane, 
He said he'd never roam alone, 
And we soon met again. 
SPOKEN. — W e 
are meeting quite often now, and I 
never 
will forget the first time : 
When we met there by the river, etc. 
THERE'S ALWAYS A SEAT IN THE PARLOR 
FOR YOU. 
Written by WILLIAM ScAN.LAN,.and performed by the great SCANW4 
and CnoNEst. 
Minsie published by F. W. IIELmicK, No. al Fourth St , Cincinnati, 0. 
THE subject to-night of my song is love, 
Something quite heavy to bear ; 
When that being you love to you proves untrue, 
For none else in the world do you care. 
The lady I 
love is an angel divine, 
And with her my life I 
would share ; 
But whene'er I 
go to her house her to see, 
There is always somebody there. 
SPOKEN. —I explained the matter to her the other 
evening, and when I 
had finished, she looked into my 
face this way, and said, that's nothing— 
CHORUS. 
There's always a 
seat in the parlor for you, 
No matter how many are there ; 
There's always a 
seat in the parlor for you, 
A 
sofa, a 
stool, or a 
chair. 
I 
went to her house one evening last week. 
You may easily judge my surprise ; 
I 
was just going to enter the hallway when 
I 
met that which opened my eyes. 
THERE'S ALWAYS A SEAT IN THE PARLOR 
FOR YOU.—Concluded. 
For there stood a 
man both tall and stout, 
Who said, what do you wish here ? 
Grabbed me by the neck, threw me out on the walk, 
And the last words I 
could hear while there was— 
CHORUS. 
There's always a 
seat in the gutter for you, 
No matter how many are there; 
There's always a 
seat in the gutter for you, 
When you come around here have a 
care. 
Now the young men I 
go with all gave me the laugh, 
My troubles to them I 
have told ; 
They say I 
am foolish to speak to her, 
Because I've been so often sold. 
No matter how often I 
have or may be, 
My love I 
shall never expel, 
I'll follow her, yes, both day and night, 
And my burdensome tale I 
will tell. 
SPOKEN.—Yes ; 
I 
shall haunt her day and night if it's 
only to hear her say— 
CHORUS. 
There's always a 
seat in the parlor for you, 
No matter how many are there; 
There's always a 
seat in the parlor for you, 
A 
sofa, a 
stool, or a 
chair.

Words by EDWARD HARRIGAN. 
Music by G. W. H. Cluirrrs. 
Sung in EDWARD DARRIGAN'1S great play of " Old Lavender." 
On, many 11100118 have passed and gone, 
Since first I 
went to school, 
At Harvard, dear old Harkrd, friends, 
I 
learned the Golden Rule; 
My classmates scattered here and there, 
All trod their different ways. 
I 
love to think and ponder o'er 
My youthful college days. 
(Repeat last two lines.) 
I 
remember when a 
Freshmen there ; 
My age just twenty-four, 
In the Yale and Harvard races, 
I 
always rowed stroke oar ; 
Our colors—handsome scarlet bright— 
First led the van always. 
Admired by the ladies all, 
Was I 
in college days. 
(Repeat last two lines.) 
Oh, the day when I 
did graduate, 
I 
was my parents' pride, 
Fitted for the bar or bench, 
A 
linguist, too, beside ; 
Socially I'd always meet 
My colleagues bright and gay, 
And toss a 
merry social glass, 
To our commencement day. 
(Repeat last two lines.) 
Culture and intelligence 
Are qualities quite fine, 
They help constitute the gentleman, 
In every worldly clime ; 
You may crush them down unto the ground 
With poverty's cold ways, 
They'll rise again, assert their claims, 
As taught in college days.

FEARFULLY AND WONDERFULLY MADE: 
BAN.ro Sm.°. 
(New Air.) 
Written and composed by SAM DEVERE. 
DECEPTION just now is the rule all around, 
It's practiced in all shades of life ; 
Just mind what I 
say, and be careful, my friends, 
When the time comes to pick out a 
wife. 
Her eyes may be loving, her smile may be sweet, 
When you approach her she's timid and afraid ; 
Be careful, look well before making the leap, 
You don't know how the dear girl is made. 
In the good days of old, in our grand-mothers' time, 
Girls didn't enamel or paint ; 
Didn't wear palpitators their bosoms to swell, 
Didn't lace themselves up till they'd faint ; 
Didn't wear patent calves, or use bloom of youth, 
And the rose in their cheecks didn't fade. 
You must know a 
girl well now before you get stuck, 
For she's fearfully and wonderfully made. 
Girls long ago didn't pencil their brows, . 
Use lotions to make the skin fair ; 
The girls long ago combed the hair on their heads, 
Now it's combed on the back of a 
chair. 
I've got more to tell when I 
see you. 
alone, 
I 
have said too much here I'm afraid. 
But before you get married, examine them well, 
For they're fearfully and wonderfully made. 
THE EXILE'S FAREWELL. 
Written and composed by BAim-Ey FAGAN, and dedicated to his friend, 
DAVY DOHERTY, Of the B P. 
How dim grows the shore of my own native isle, 
As 
from its green hills I 
depart an exile, 
My eyes fill with tears and I 
sadly regret, 
The parting with those I 
shall never forget. 
My own darling Aily my playmate of youth, 
That dear soul of innocence, virtue and truth, 
To leave you, my heart fills with sadness and pain. 
In my dreams I 
am seeing you, darling, again. 
CHORUS. 
Farewell, mavourneen, from you I 
must roam, 
The cabin and green fields that once were my home, 
My dear aged parents from them I 
depart, 
At leaving you, darling, it near breaks my heart. 
Oh, when shall I 
visit the land of my birth, 
The green hills where once full of pleasure and mirth, 
The colleens assembled to join in the glee, 
In my bright days of childhood, I 
ne'er more shall see. 
How happy the hearth of the poor Irish lad, 
To wander alone through the fields I'd be glad, 
-Where the bright sunlight rays, east their beams from 
above, 
On my own Irish home I 
so dearly love. 
Farewell, mavourneen, etc. 
'Tis you, my own darling, I 
am longing to see, 
How bright your eyes sparkle, how glad you will be 
To hear of my coming back to my home, 
From which I 
shall never be tempted to roam. 
Cheer up, mavourneen, don't harbor despair, 
I 
long for a 
glance" of my beauty so fair, 
And with thee I'll linger, fond years shall decay, 
I'll ne'er part with you, darling, till laid in the clay. 
Farewell, mavourneen, etc. 
MASSA'S KITCHEN FLOOR. 
As sung by JOHNSON and BRUNO, with success. 
Two old. Virginia niggers. 
You mustn't think we're green ; 
When working on the steamboat 
On the Mississippi stream. 
We used to tote the cotton bales, 
And heave the plank ashore ; 
And often spend. our money 
On the Old Virginia shore. 
Two lightning colored mokes, 
(
Breo;',..) 
From Old Virginia shore. (Breqk. 
if epeq! .) 
And now we'll show you how to dance 
On old Massa's kitchen floor. 
When on the old plantation, 
darkeys held our sway ; • 
We'd sing and dance from morn till night, 
And on the banjo play ; 
We'd pick the cotton, hoe the corn, 
And when our work was o'er, 
Then altogether we would dance 
On Massa's kitchen floor. 
Two li,glitning. 
THE IRISH GENTLEMAN . 
Written by W ALLY W EST. 
Music by PETE -MHO H ALEY. 
I'm an Irishman from Donegal, 
Though I'm sure you'd never guess, 
If I 
had only left you 
To judge it from my dress. 
I'm a 
representative Irishman, 
And I'm here to prove to you 
That in Ireland, as well as here, 
There are gentlemen full true. 
CHORUS. 
I'm proud to say I'm Irish. 
Deny it I 
never can, 
I'm a 
true representative of Erin's green isle, 
And an Irish gentleman. 
We see men come upon the stage 
Who pretend to represent, 
With peculiar brogue, the character, 
Of a 
decent Irish gent. 
If they'd try it in old Ireland 
They soon would understand 
That the Irishmen repudiate 
Such an insult to our land. 
I'm proud to say I'm Irish, etc. 
Some paint their faces like a 
Turk, 
And like a 
Chinaman they talk, 
And an elephant with a 
broken leg 
Seems the model for their walk. 
If they'd go to Ireland, sure they'd find 
We're just like all the rest, 
There's gentlemen and ladies there, 
That's equal to their best. 
I'm proud to say I'm Irish, etc.

There's no one half so handy 
As this nigger, you be bound, 
I

And my cognomen is Sam— 
This Slim and Slippery Southern Nig, 
From Sunny Alabam.

See me dance and slide about, 
I 
turn myself near wrong side out, 
I 
hope that you are satisfied, 
For I'm the ladies' man, 
This Slim and Slippery Southern Nig, 
From Sunny Alabam. 
Singing is my chief delight, 
Of dancing never tire, 
The way I 
throw myself around 
You'll say I'm hung on wire. 
I'm my mother's only joy, 
My father's name was Ham, 
So watch the antic tricks 
Of this Nig- from Alabam. 
See me dance, etc.

Written by FRANK DE-MONT, and sung by HAnnY Woonsox with great 
success at TONY PAST011,'. 
FAR away in the South, among the cotton fields. 
Is the place I

Oh ! the dear sunny clime where I 
was bred and born, 
And the memory is ever dear to me; 
Oh !

In this wide, weary world. wherever I 
may go, 
There is no place like the dear old home.

Then give me a 
home in the dear old South, 
For fondly I 
love it still ; 
Then I 
sigh night and day, what I 
long to see to-rain 
is that old log cabin on the hill. 
Oh ! the ones I 
love is sleeping in the ground, 
When I 
am passing so fast away, 
And my heart grows so sad I 
long to return, 
Oh ! the old man ain't what lie used to be ; 
And the magnolias bloom around the cabin door, 
Tis then I 
turn with a 
sigh, 
Oh ! 
I 
will go back again, back to them cotton fields. 
In that old cabin home there let me die. 
Then give me, etc. 
DON'T FORGET ME, IDA. DEAR. 
Written by W ILLIE W ILDW,,NE. 
W ILES the spring morning in breaking., 
Tips with gold each quivering spray, 
And the pretty little flowers awaking, 
Welcome the new-made day ; 
When the brilliant sun is rising, 
O'er the vale and o'er the lea, 
That it seems to be apprising 
That my love is nearor to me. 
ellonts. 
Then don't forget me, Ida darling, 
Though the days be dull and drear, 
When you hear the voice of the starling, 
Don't forget me, Ida dear. 
When the dews of eve are falling, 
On the bushwood hedges near, 
And the happy birds are calling 
To their mates so soft and clear. 
While their sweet notes till the air, 
Sweet as ever sweet as can be, 
Perchance some of them will dare, 
To breathe my name to thee. 
Then don't forget, etc 
When the bright new moon is peeping 
From its home way in the sky. 
I 
hope a 
thought you're keepintr. 
In the sweet by-and-by. 
For a 
boy who now is roving 
Far across the deep blue sea, 
And who will ne'er cease loving, 
Your grace and purity. 
Then don't forget, etc. 
As sung only by the original EmmERsoN 4: CLARK, of 'cosi' PASTOR'S 
Troupe. 
On, here we are a 
happy pair, 
As you can plainly see ; 
Old mama gave us a 
holiday, 
And so we'll have a 
jubilee. 
De fox he burrow in de ground, 
De birds live in de tree, 
But we're at home most any place, 
No matter whar we be. 
CHORUS. 
Quit your fooling, 
Stop dat nonsense, honey, 
Quit dat ticklkng me, 
It makes me feel so good. 
There is music in the parlor, 
And in the kitchen, too,

Oh, glory hallelug,11 ; 
Put on de golden slippers, 
We will give our feet a

We'll dance the double shuffle, 
And cut the pigeon wing.

THE PAR EX. NIGS, 
Dedicated to JOHNSON and But:No by JAMES F. 
DOOLEY. 
BEHOLD before you here to-night two double•breasted 
mokes ; 
We guarantee to cure the blues, and we'll prove that 
we're no hoax; 
We'll do our best to please you, if we dislocate our necks ; 
Observe us get our work in, then you'll gamble we're 
Par Ex. 
If you watch the capering of these gents, (
Break.) 
We know you'll say that we're immense ; (
Break.) 
Just watch us while we sift around, and dance two or 
three steps ; 
And when we're through, we know that you will gamble 
we're Par Ex. 
When we worked upon the levee, way down at New 
Orleans ; 
We had some very happy times, and seen some joyous 
scenes, 
We used to juggle cotton bales, upon the steamer's decks, 
And when the work was over, why, ' tis then we'd feel 
Par Ex. 
If you watch, etc. 
But perhaps we are intruding upon you're precious time, 
If so don't be offended, nor consider it a 
crime ; 
For we always labor hard to please, and do not wish to

So we leave it to your judgment, if these coons are not

MONEY WILL ALWAYS FIND FRIENDS. 
Sung with great success all over the country by II.utay MovrAouE. 
Though sad the appearance I 
make to you now, 
Well up I 
have been in my time ; 
But stony and cold has the world been of late, 
And poverty still seems a 
crime. 
I 
have found out with bitter experience this: 
Without money you soon will decay, 
And those who you thought you could count as your friends, 
When wanted were always away. 
CHOEUS. 
If poor you will find it a 
terrible crime, 
For poverty often offends •, 
But if you are wealthy, how different then— 
For money will always find friends. 
When I 
kept a 
fine house and parties could give 
En a 
style that's been seldom before, 
Friends I 
could find in plenty, of course; 
Their numbers I 
could count by the score. 
But now if I 
meet them and ask them for help, 
With a 
shrug of the shoulder they say. 
" 
Excuse me just now ; 
see you again !" 
And nodding they shuffle away. 
If poor, you will find, etc. 
Perhaps the dark cloud that's been hanging o'erhead 
Will fade, and its place become bright ; 
And fortune, thought fickle, will smile o:Ice again 
On this most deplorable wight. 
And if but again I 
have wealth it command, 
I'll pay back to those with a 
frown 
Who ought to have helped a 
friend when in need, 
And not kicked him because he was down. 
If poor, you will !Ind, etc. 
SHE DIDN'T NAME THE DAY. 
An original Double ( Male) Song and Dance, as performed only by the 
DALY BROTHERS—THOMAS and W ILLIAM.

FIRST LOVER. 
I'VE just come down to see my gal, she lives across the 
way, 
She loves me very dearly, and her Pop is rich, they say ; 
I'll ask her if she'll take a walk, when the stars are 
shining bright, 
I know that she admires my style, I'll pop this very 
night.

SECOND LOVER. 
As I 
was walking down the street, I 
thought I'd make a 
call 
Upon my love, and ask her if she'd tend a 
fancy ball ; 
I've also bought the wedding ring—I 
know she won't 
decline, 
And then how happy I 
will be—she'll be forever mine. 
I 
know I'll be accepted, etc.

screamed from above.

Now give it to them, throw them out, and drive the fools 
away. 
And set the dogs upon me, now that's what my gal did

You see we're not accepted, now let us go away, (

We're sadder, yes, and wiser since she didn't name the

MeCORMACK, THE COPPER 
Written by W ILLIAM SCANLAN, and performed by SCANLAN and Cnomx 
in their great sketch written by W ILLIAM SCANLAN, entitled 
"McCormack, the Copper." 
W HY do I 
smile ? well I 
will tell, 
My heart is filled with joy, 
I'm a 
dandy copper on the Broadway Squad, 
And a 
brave one at that am I. 
If there's a 
murder or fight about, 
You'll always find me near, 
And as I 
pass the ladies say, 
Ah ! isn't he a 
dear. 
CHORUS. 
I'm a 
darling, ain't I 
charming. 
And the ladies all say as I 
pass them by, 
Ain't he purty ! ain't he lovely ! 
Dan McCormack the copper am I. (
Repeat.) 
I 
visit all the collar shops, 
About three times a 
week, 
In one of them my sweetheart works, 
And of love I 
always speak. 
I 
acquaint her with all the acknowledgments 
Which from the public I 
receive, 
And tell her how they'll sigh and sob, 
When the force I'd have to lave. 
I'm a 
darling, etc. 
My antecedents were high-toned, 
Respected everywhere ; 
My father could whip an elephant— 
My mother could whip a 
bear ; 
My sister could toss a 
camel, 
My brother could fight a 
fly, 
They could stand a 
rhinoceros on his head, 
And sing the Swate By-and-Bye.

APPLES AND PEARS. 
Sung with great success by W ILD and BRADLEY, of Theatre Comique, 
514 Broadway, N. Y. 
I'm a 
widow with a 
large family, 
My husband was killed in the war ; 
He enlisted one day for a 
soldger, 
Faith, they murdered my darling agra , 
From the Government I 
receive a 
small pension, 
Which all my family does share ; 
Faith, it ain't enough to maintain us, 
For I 
have to sell apples and pears ! 
If I 
was a 
man I 
could labor, 
Sure, what can a 
poor woman do ; 
I 
can't stand all day at the wash tub, 
The reason I'll tell now to you ; 
I'm troubled bad with the rheumaticks, 
And to put up with, many's the cares,' 
And that's the reason you see me 
Out here, selling apples and pears. 
There's a 
great many men I 
could marry— 
There's Dennis McCarthy, so fat ! 
There's Patsy Marley, a 
sound boy ! 
Faith, he is a 
good Democrat ! 
But they all ;lo object to the children ; 
To marry me, not one of them cares; 
So I'll let them all go to the divil, 
And stick to my apples and pears !

FEVER. 
Beware the first approaches of this stealthy foe, that cometh 
like a 
thief in the night. 
A change of drinking- water, unripe 
fruit, a 
debauch, a 
slight cold may be the first clutch of Fever. 
It can be guarded against and repelled by a 
timely use of 
Merlin's Health Granules. A person should never 
travel to the mountains, to the sea- shore, or on the ocean with-
out a 
supply. 
Doctors admit this fact, and they don't speak 
well of any medicine unless its merits are very great. 
DVSPEPSIA, the arch- fiend of misery and decay, can 
be cured effectually by a 
persistent use of Meran's Health 
Granules. Why'? 
Because these Granules go to the 
very root of the complaint. 
They not only drive out the fecu-
lent matter -that clogs the avenues of the body, but they in-
vigorate and give tone to the digestive apparatus, and make 
healthful blood flow through every petty artery ; then comes 
a 
good appetite, and good food insures a 
lasting cure. 
In the Cholera Years it was found that the firm, 
thing needed was to drive out of the stomach and bowels the 
noxious germs of the destroyer. 
Nothing is so effectual for 
this purpose as Merlin's Health Granules, for while 
they are very powerful for good they are harmless for evil. 
A child may take them in moderation, while they can be 
made to operate upon the strongest man. 
" 
I 
DON'T KNOW WHAT AILS ME !" 
How often do we hear this remark. A man or woman grows 
weak, feeble, irresolute. 
As Hamlet, says, " Man delights not 
me, nor woman either." 
This feeling arises from many causes. 
Lack of exercise, loss of appetite, deep grief— all these tend to 
render the fluids of the body heavy, thick, sluggish. 
There 
was a 
health- lesson taught by the angel stirring the pool be-
fore the sick got any benefit from its waters. 
It needed action, 
vitalizing with pure air. 
This is precisely the effect produced 
by Merlin's Health Granules. The sluices are cleaned, 
and the nutriment finds its way where it is wanted and can do 
most good.

MALARIAL FEVER. 
However doctors may differ as to the exact cause of this 
fearful disease, they all agree upon one thing, that poisonous 
atoms have found their way into the system. 
Common sense 
tells us that the way to cure this disease is to expel these 
poisonous atoms. 
This is effectually done by a 
free use of 
Merlin's Health Granules. Not only do they cleanse 
the bowels of the perilous stuff that to retain is fatal, but they 
restore the blood to activity, and make it pay frequent visits to 
the lungs, where it becomes aerated and full of health. This is 
purifying at the fountain head. 
Where the source is clean the 
stream cannot be foul. 
Good health and chins and fever of 
course cannot exist together. 
THE GOUT CAN BE RELIEVED, 
if not entirely banished from the system, by using Merlin's 
Health Granules at the first intimation of an approach-
ing attack. 
The Granules prevent the formation of the 
chalky deposits which, if allowed to become at all fixed, ren-
der the joints stiff, and make them work with difficulty. 
The 
Granules have exactly the same effect upon the joints that 
grease has upon axles and wheels—lubricates the grating 
parts, then the joints work smooth and easy and without any 
pain. 
Try Merlin's Health Granules occasionally if 
you want to bid defiance to that old hereditary foe, the Gout_ 
AVAKEFULNE §S AD SO3IXAMBULIS 3,1, 
though so different in many of their features, are children of 
the same parents—Indigestion and Torpidity of Blood. 
Both 
ct these complaints can be cured in the same way, simply by 
producing a 
healthy, natural digestion. 
It is no use trying 
local remedies. 
You may swathe and bathe and bandage the 
head till you are tired. 
It will not alter the condition of the 
blood. 
You might as well expect to make a 
house healthy by 
whitewashing the outside and cleaning the windows while the 
cellar was reeking with sewer gas. No! the blood must be puri-
fied, or disease will ride rampant. 
Use Merlin's Health 
Grannies and Wakefulness will subside into calm slumber, 
and the open-eyed sleep- walker will remain with his eyes closed 
upon the unruffled pillow.

health and money, as their timely use will avert attacks 
of Bilious Fever and Malarial Fever, and will so fortify

DON'T WAIT TILL TO- MORROW 
If you feel any symptoms of Jaundice or other complaints be-
ginning in a 
non- acting Liver. 
The bile is stopped, and not 
doing its duty. 
Soon follow torpidity, congestion, mot'. 
lineation, DEATH. Take at once a 
full dose of Her-
iin"s 11.1!aith Granules. That will stop the disease. 
NERVOUS DEBILITY 
is the curse of civilization. 
Luckily it can be cured. 
It pro-
ceeds from intense mental strain ; from violating physical laws, 
throwing the reins on the neck of Passion. The body becomes 
impaired, the mind follows suit, then the weak body and the 
irresolute mind plague each other, and drive the poor wretch 
to mental imbecility ; but, as we have said, Nervous Debility 
can be cured ; the diseased humors can be driven from the 
blood; the stomach becomes strong and active, the heart 
bounds to its work, the mind follows r.uit, black despair flies, 
health returns, not by any miracle, but simply by using the 
great remedy, Merlin's Health Granules. One box 
has been known to bring a 
poor wretch from the edge of the 
grave. 
Do your bones ache 3 You are either filled with Malarial 
Poison or there lingers in your system the dire effects of an-
cestral indiscretions and the Mercurial Poisons never driven 
out. 
But do not despair. 
By judiciously using the never-
failing remedy, Merlin's Health Granules, the poison-
ous atoms are expelled to give place to pure, strength- giving 
blood. 
THE PRESENT DAY 
is the time to try and get well. 
The ounce of prevention is 
the thing. 
Don't wait till you have to get the pound of cure. 
Stop the first small leak. 
Don't wait till the ship is water-
logged. 
Disease is absolutely prevented by using Men 
lin's Health Grauules as a 
family medicine.

" 
CONE AND LET US REASON TOGETHER." 
It has been veil said that he that cannot reason is a 
fool ; he 
that dare not reason is a 
slave ; he that will not reason is a 
bigot. 
We do not believe, good reader, that you belong to either of 
these three classes, and therefore addref,q ourselves to you. 
You will have noticed that every Doctor, after feeling the 
pulse, looking at the tongue, and ascertaining the temperature 
of the body, pauses for a 
moment's thought. 
Then he quickly 
asks, " Are your bowels regular ? " 
This you will therefore 
notice is 
the very key-note by which he seeks to know 
whether you are healthy or diseased. 
By further questions in 
the same direction lie learns the particular nature of the dis-
ease. 
But no odds how many different points he may wander 
to, he soon returns to the digestive organs. 
The disease may be most apparent in the lungs, the kidneys, 
the heart, the liver, the head ; but it is always the bowels he 
treats as the salient point of disease that has to be first treated, 
hence the first medicine prescribed is a 
dose to act upon the 
organs of digestion. 
This is wisdom. 
The doctor knows that 
without thorough digestion half the food taken is 
worse than useless. 
As certain things strewn around become 
incorporated with the soil and nourish it (left in a 
compact 
heap they breed disease), so without an active digestion food is 
hurtful. 
These are truths that no sane man will attempt to 
gainsay. 
What is the remedy ? 
Surely a 
medicine powerful 
enough to carry ow all injurious matter, and at the same time 
having such balsamic qualities as will heal any inflammations 
that may have arisen in the lining of the different ducts. 
Now 
the very best thing that can be used to do what all doctors 
recommend is Merlin's Health Granules. Pleasant 
to take, easy in operation, and leaving lasting good effects after 
their use. 
This is homely, sound doctrine. 
Try, and be con-
vinced. 
Merlin's Health Granules do not compete 
with any other aperient medicine; they simply extinguish 
them. 
The sun don't fight with a 
penny dip, it merely out-
shines it.
