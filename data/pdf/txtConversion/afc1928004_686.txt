OPINIONS OF THE PRESS. 
"ARCHIE W HITE appeared on the Tambourine End with Duprez and 
Benedict's Minstrels, and made a 
decided hit. 
Mn. W HITE is au excellent 
comedian, who in addition to his humorous abilities, is a singer of no 
mean order."—Kansas City Journal. 
" 
ARCHIE W HITE can safely be classed A 
No. 1 
as a 
comedian, while his 
tricks cf keeping two tambourines in continuous oblique revolutions across 
the stage at the same time, was a 
triumph of nerve and skill."—Lincoln 
(Nebraska) Globe. 
" 
ARCHIE W HITE is undoubtedly one of the best comedians that ever 
appeared in this city."— Chicago Journal. 
" 
Ancum W HITE 
in his aged negro specialties, met with general favor, 
and proved a 
strong card."— Cincinnati Commercial. 
" 
W HITE is one of the funniest men in the business ; modest and unas-
suming, and bound to shine most brilliantly in the minstrel galaxy of 
stars."— Syracuse Standard. 
"Mn. W HITE, like the lamented (leo. L. Fox, has more of a 
ministerial 
than a 
minstrel or professional air; but on the stage he is a king among 
the fun-makers."—Cohoes News. 
"ARCHIE 
W HITE is a 
master with two tambourines, and was perfectly at 
home on the end. 
His jokes were new and not coarse, and everything he 
does is of a 
high order of merit."—Saratoga Evening Journal. 
"Originality characterized the vitty, pungent hits made by the End 
Men. ARCHIE W HITE kept the audience in a 
continuous roar of laughter. 
He is a 
Rochester boy, and an old favorite in our city. 
He is a 
born min-
strel, and his comicalities and witticisms evince originality that already 
rank him high in the profession."—St. Joseph ( Mo.) Herald. 
" 
ARCHIE W HITE, who has gained such popularity in this city, is now 
travelling with " Harry Robinson's Minstrels," and is a 
great favorite."— 
New York Mercury. 
" 
ARC HIE W HITE, the unapproachable End Man, kept the audience in a 
continual uproar. A 
most particular feature of this gentleman in his bon. 
flints was the absence of cant slang and innendoes; his witticisms being 
clothed in the most select and appropriate language. 
He exhibited a 
de-
gree of intellect rarely possessed by " End Men,” and in private life ha is 
an educated gentleman,—Dubuque (Iowa) Herald.

"ALWAYS ON THE MOVE ." 
An original copyrighted Song and Dance specialty, by ARCHIE W RITE. 
On, here I 
am, a 
lively boy as ever you did see, 
I'm always free from every care and full of jollity. 
I 
hope that I 
will please you all, 
And that you will approve 
Of my little eccentricities ; 
I'm always on the move. 
So now my blood begins to boil, 
Just watch the rattle of the shoe ; 
I've got the very latest style, 
And so a 
jig I'll dance for you. 
(Dance.) 
I've done the nerve almost to death, 
And danced an overture ; 
I 
knocked old hundred out of breath, 
And tired out the cure. 
At Lanagan's Ball I 
beat them all, 
As to you I 
can prove ; 
I'll keep the ball a 
rolling on ; 
I'm always on the move. 
So 
now I'm going to indulge 
In what I 
call extravagance ; 
The name of it I'll not divulge, 
But it's a 
solid song and dance. 
(Dance.)

THE OLD LOG CABIN ON THE HILL. 
Written by FRANK DUMONT, and snug by HARRY W OODSON with treat, 
success at TONY PASTOR'S. 
FAR away in the South, among the cotton fields. 
Is the place I 
ever long to see; 
Oh! the dear sunny clime where I 
was bred and born, 
And the memory is ever dear to me; 
Oh ! the mocking bird's singing in the trees close by, 
While far from the spot I 
now roam, 
In this wide, weary world wherever I 
may go, 
There is no place like the dear old home. 
CHORUS. 
Then give me a 
home in the dear old South. 
For fondly I 
love it still ; 
Then I 
sigh night and day, what I 
long to see agra 
Is that old log cabin on the hill. 
Oh ! the ones I 
love is sleeping in the ground, 
-When I 
am passing so fast away, 
And my heart grows so sad I 
long to return, 
Oh ! the old man ain't what he used to be ; 
And the magnolias bloom around the cabin door, 
Tis then I 
turn with a 
sigh, 
Oh ! I 
will go back again, back to them cotton fields. 
In that old cabin home there let me die. 
Then give me, eta.

UNSOPHISTICATED LOVE. 
Erud Song. 
Sung by ARCHIE W HITE with D LIP.AEZ and BENEDICT** 
Minstrels. 
THE gal that I 
love is both tall and serene, 
Her teeth are bran new, and her cheeks are so green 
Her voice is as sweet as the tones of a 
mule, 
Her uncle's a 
sailor, her brother's a 
fool. 
She can chew all day long on a 
big lump of gum, 
Like a 
freckled faced boy with a 
wart on his thumb, 
Her appetite's good, she'd devour with great ease, 
A 
couple of tons of old limburger cheese. 
CIIORUS. 
She had a 
great love for the new silver dollars, 
She looks like a 
fairy in clean paper collars, 
When she opens her head the inside can be seen, 
No " taffy " at all, she's a 
lovely sardine. 
She owns a 
big farm where the bull frogs do grow, 
She raises a 
crop of the best kind of snow ; 
I 
gave her my picture dressed in my best togs, 
And she put it in the sty for to frighten the hogs. 
She wears a 
glass eye, and its color is red, 
She's a 
big bunch of feathers attached to her head, 
She can talk broken Chinese in seventeen tongues, 
And blow down a 
house with her cast iron lungs. 
She had, etc. 
I 
never can tell all her beauties at once, 
She calls me a 
sugar-coated galvanized dunce; 
When she kisses me with her big mouth open wide, 
There's room enough in it for an elephant to ride. 
If she ever got mad she'd pulverize your jaw 
With one little swipe of her delicate paw; 
What shall I 
say of her gaiters to wear ? 
It takes forty big cowskins to make her a 
pair. 
She had, etc.

THE SNOOZE. 
Written feir 
ED. FREINTOti by ED. HAnnrams., 
THERE'S a 
fellow who lives in this city, 
And he sleeps on the floor of saloons; 
He lives on birdseed and crackers, 
And his business is juggling spittoons ; 
He's known by every barkeeper, 
As a 
bum he is the worst of thin all; 
You bet he never would tumble, 
The ham with the terrible gall. 
They say he is a 
horrible snoozer, 
And a 
boozer, what a 
rooster; 
When he borrows your money you're loser, 
The suoozer with the terrible gall. 
He has got an eye in his head like a 
mackerel, 
Aid his neck is as long as a 
crane; 
He eats gruel that is made out of sawdust, 
Mixed up with a 
seven days' rain ; 
His clothes would cover a 
Nair-pin--
Shoot him with a 
big cannon ball; 
You bet that he never would drop— 
The bum with the terrible gall. 
They say, etc,

HE WANTED HIS BREAKFAST. 
By BARRIE GRAY. 
TBEtscene occurred at Manhattan Beach. 
It was one of 
those pleasant midsummer evenings when a 
grand pyrotech-
nic display, or a 
select concert by Gilmore's famous band, 
attracted a 
large number of visitors thither. 
This occasion was one of festivity, and an extra display 
of fireworks and a 
specially selected programme of music 
attracted an unusally large number. 
As one passed to and 
fro amongst the vast multitude he could distinguish people 
of all classes and nationalities, and not until the last rocket 
was discharged, and Gilmore ceased to waive his baton, did 
they think of " Home, sweet home." Then was a 
rush for 
the gates. 
People were clamorous in their vain endeavors 
to gain access to the cars, but the blue coats and brass but-
tons of the law warned them that the attempt would be 
useless. 
The writer elbowed his way through to the gate 
and inquired of the law " how long before the train would 
start." 
He explained that the time for starting was 11:25, 
but the delay was caused by the absence of the incoming 
train. 
A 
half hour elapsed and still " no thoroughfare." 
A 
stout gentleman, of the Teutonic type, who had here-
tofore been silent, here made a 
sensation. 
Clearinr, his 
way through the crowd as best he could, he neared the 
" 
officer " and gave vent to his feelings as follows : 
" 
Yousf look here, mine frendt ; ouf I 
peen kept here 
enny longer ash dhis, I 
youst vant you sendt me mine 
prekfasdt." 
The gates were opened.

KEEP YOUR EYE ON THE FINGER BOARD, MY 
HONEY. 
END SONG. 
Written expressly for ARCHIE W HITE, by NED STRAIGHT. 
Published by B. 
W . 
HITCHCOCK, 166 Nassau St., N. Y. 
As you go travelling through this world, 
Keep your eye on the linger board, my honey. 
There'll be temptations at you hurled, 
Keep your eye on the finger board, my honey ; 
And when old Satan shows his hand, 
Don't go and join the sinner's band ; 
But listen to this coon's command ; 
Keep your eye on the finger board, do. 
CHORUS. 
Keep your eye on the finger board, my honey; 
Keep your eye on the linger board, my honey ; 
If you get off the track, 
Heap of trouble to get back ; 
Keep your eye on the finger board, " do, do, do." 
Keep your eye on the finger board, my honey; 
Keep your eye on the finger board, my honey; 
If you get off the track, 
heap of trouble to get back ; 
Keep your eye on the finger board, do. 
When Satan tries you with his snares, 
Keep your eye on the finger board, my honey; 
Don't let him catch you unawares, 
Keep your eye on the finger board, my honey; 
When Job was covered up with bibs 
He did not spoil his face with smiles ; 
So listen to this coon awhile, 
Keep your eye on the finger board, do. 
Koop your oye. etc.

WHERE THE PEARLY DEW DROPS FALL ." 
SONG AND DANCE. 
Words and Music by ARCHIE W HITE, and performed by Duprez and Ben 
edict's Minstrels. 
DOWN by a 
little babbling brook, 
Beside the meadows green, 
There dwells a 
charming little maid, 
Her age is sweet sixteen ; 
Her hair it hangs in ringlets, 
As onward she does stroll 
Toward that lovely little cot, 
Where the pearly dew drops fall. 
CHORUS. 
For I 
love to stand and watch her, 
As onward she does stroll 
Toward that lovely little cot, 
Where the pearly dew drops fall. 
This evening I 
will meet her, 
As the clock is striking nine; 
If she her promise will keep true. 
I'm sure that I 
will mine ; 
And we will walk together, 
Down by the garden wall, 
Until we reach the cottage, 
Where the pearly dew drops fall. 
For I 
love to stand, etc.

MY SWEET MARY ANN. 
By HARRY BENNETT. 
I 
AM fond of courting, also of sporting', 
I 
often go courting the girl I 
adore; 
Her hair she does crimple, her cheek has a 
dimple. 
her nose has a 
pimple five days out of four; 
Her first name is Mary, her last name is Cary; 
She never gets airy, the dear little sprite; 
She's pretty, she's witty, the belle of the city, 
And walks like a 
kitty, with step prim and light. 
CHORUS. 
Have you seen Mary, light as a 
fairy ? 
Never contrary, sings like a 
canary, 
From old Tipperary, she works in a 
dairy, 
And never gets weary, my sweet Mary Ann. 
Her voice is soprano, she plays the piano ; 
The " Star Spangled Banner" is the song she sings; 
iler style would amaze ye and set ye all crazy. 
With the songs of this daisy the neigh borhood 
ring; 
Her appearance is dashing, slis dresses in fashion, 
She's the darlipg for mashing the boys ev'rywhere; 
We're soon to be married, too long we have tarried ; 
Four years she has carried a 
lock of my hair. 
nave you seen Mary ? etc. 
THAT'S WHERE I'D LIKE TO BE. 
Old Man's Song. 
Sang by ARCHIE Wilma. 
THERE'S a 
spot in the sunny South, 
Where the orange blossoms grow; 
Where the mocking bird sings in the trees, 
And glistening waters flow. 
My heart longs for that paradise, 
And in my dreams I 
see 
The cotton fields as white as snow. 
Oh, that's where I'd like to be. 
Oh, take me back, I 
want to go, 
My childhood's home to see, 
In Alabama's sunny land, 
That's where I'd like to be. 
I 
remember when I 
left that place., 
'Twas many years ago, 
I 
thought to find a 
fairer spot, 
But sad my heart does grow. 
I'm all alone, no loving words 
Are spoken now to me, 
My dear old friends are far away. 
Oh, that's where I'd like to be. 
Oh, tnice rn" lin ok.

MY UNLUCKY GIRT., 
Written by JANES COOKE. 
N.tv girl is a 
most unlucky duck, but dresses in the fashion, 
She's always getting in a 
muss, but never gets in a 
pa* 
sion, 
Her hand is like a 
bear's paw, I 
never shah forget her, 
She says her boots are number three, but tens would fit 
her better. 
A 
circus came some time ago, and to set it she was bent; 
And when the show was over to supper of course we went, 
She eat up everything they had, my heart got in a 
flutter, 
A 
codfish ball stuck in her throat, her head went into the 
butter. 
.The doctor brought a 
stomach pump, and said that she 
must die, 
She seized a 
roll of sausage and pasted him in the eye ; 
The Coroner's jury sat on her and settled the critical 
question, 
That she wore too large a 
waterfall and died of sponta-
neous combustion. 
She got up next day with a 
toothache from the bunions 
on her toes, 
Her under jaw was spavined, the epizootic got up her nose, 
She went into consumption, and I 
hear her last disaster, 
She broke her neck by falling through a 
hole in a 
porous 
TIlater.

THE VILLAIN WITH A JACK KNIFE CHASED 
HER. 
AN END SONG. 
Words by PETER GALE, of II
I° 
AMERICAN FOTTE. 
Am—" 
Very Fresh." 
I 
WENT to the garden with old Jim Birch, 
For to hitch up the donkey to take us to church, 
We got in the sleigh, when the villain, Jim Crow, 
Took the young lady and he threw her in the snow. 
A 
long tail rat a 
crawling for his hole, 
A 
monkey and a 
baboon a 
climbing up a 
pole; 
Sally in the garden a 
sifting sand, 
Johnny, hand me down that Cincinnati ham. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, how that poor gal did suffer, 
Oh, what trouble that lady seen, 
Oh, how that poor girl did suffer, 
And the villain with a 
jack knife chased her. 
(Repeat.) 
We went in the church and we kneeled down to pray, 
To listen to what the preacher would say, 
Saw Jim Crow a 
hanging around the lock, 
To try and steal the money from the missionary box. 
The bell in the steeple it started for to ring, 
And all the little children they started for to sing, 
The preacher hollered Moses, he was slaughtered with the 
lamb, 
Johnny, hand me down that Cincinnati ham. 
Oh, how that poor gal did suffer, etc.

Says the old Obadiah to the young Obadiah, 
" 
Keep it dark, Obadiah, keep it dark ! 
For I 
know a 
little tavern where they like a 
merry mood, 
Where the charge is strictly moderate, and all the liquors good ; 
Slope the backway, and the missis needn't know where we are 
gone ! "

Says the old Obadiah to the young Obadiah, 
" 
Well, you may, Obadiah, dear, you may ! 
To your parent, I'll observe, ' twould be but dutiful and just, 
And you needn't spend much money, if you get it all ' on trust.' 
I 
never felt so much inclined for larks in all my life!" 
Says the young Obadiah, "here's your wife ! " 
Says Missis Obadiah to the old Obadiah, 
" 
I've your hat, Obadiah, I've your hat !" 
Says the old Obadiah to his Missis Obadiah, 
" 
Then, Missis Obadiah, you're a 
cat ! " 
Says Missis Obadiah, " All this selfishness is stuff; 
If you'll take me out this evening I'm agreeable enough ! 
For of some such relaxation, dear, I

" 
Our conversation then you've overheard." 
Says Missis Obadiah to her old Obadiah, 
"Ev'ry word, Obadiah, ev'ry word ! 
After which, Obadiah, there is only left one course, 
You wicked old imposter, I

THB GOSPEL RAFT.. 
Written by FRANK DUMONT. 
Dedicated to Mu. ADCHIE Warm 
rsE gwine to cross the river on de gospel raft, 
Like Noah in de good ole ark ; 
Keep your candles all a-burning; keep dem burning all 
de time, 
Or you'll lose yourself and tumble in de dark. 
Get your baggage on de craft, don't forget to get your 
check ; 
You've got to pay your passage right to- day ; 
Be sure de money's good, for de captain's eye is sharp, 
You can't sneak aboard and hide away. 
Hide away, hide away ; dar's no use trying to hide 
away; 
Get your baggage on de craft, 
Don't forget to have it checked, 
For you can't sneak aboard and hide away. 
Let me tell you about de army Mr. Pharaoh did command 
-When he followed ole Moses long ago ; 
They was drowned in de water Avid their life preservers on, 
And de fishes had a 
jubilee below. 
Dar was Jonah was a 
fool and as stubborn as a 
mule ; 
But de whale he made him quickly disappear ; 
Jonah den pulled out a 
razor and he cut de whale in half, 
And he floated to de shore upon his ear. 
Hide away, etc. 
Now, take warning, little children, don't you fool about 
de raft, 
For de opposition boat is running too ; 
But she's liable to burst her boiler any time at all, 
And you niggers will be cooked into a 
stew. 
Pse got a 
private box and an opera glass to see 
You sinners trying to buzz in at de door ; 
But dey'll kick you down de stairs if you hasn't got de 
grace. 
If you come back dey'll slap you in de jaw. 
-aide away, etc-

T1  CURLY HEADED HASHER. 
BANJO SOLO. 
Wlitten by ROY LESLIE for BILLY OAIITE11. 
I'LL sing a 
song of a 
nice young man, 
Who thought himself a 
masher, 
He told the girls he was clerk in a 
bank, 
But the truth he was a 
hasher. 
He would work from sunrise in the morn 
Until his lunch was over, 
Then he'd dress himself up in a 
ten dollar wit, 
And he'd go out on the mash, sir. 
CHORUS. 
He was born in the Fall, 
This man with a 
gall, 
So loud he would bawl 
For hash through the hall. 
He laid over them all 
And he'd run them to the wall ; 
And he never would fall, 
This curly headed hasher. 
One day when the matinee was out, 
He met a 
charming lady ; 
He called her his love and turtle dove, 
And then she called him baby. - 
Some time after this to his hotel 
Went this charming lady, 
And she saw her mash a 
slicing his hash, 
On her head he spilt some gravy. 
CHORUS. 
When he saw his mash, 
He dropped with a 
crash 
A 
plate full of hash. 
From her room he did dash, 
As quick as a 
Hash; 
He shook his mash 
As quick as a 
flash, 
This curly headed hasher.

DELIA ON THE TRAPEZE. 
IRISH SONG. 
Written by Wm. J. SCANLON. 
27 
I HAVE a 
charmer, she's my alarmer, 
Oh, what a 
pleasure to have such a 
treasure, 
I 
call her baby, she calls me deary, 
We pass all our time in a 
most pleasant way. 
When we're out for a 
walk the young men do say 
As we pass them by in the street, 
"Look at Lynch and his mash, don't they cut a 
dash, 
Don't his darling look charming and sweet ?" 
CHORUS. 
But you should see Delia 
When on the trapeze, 
She'll stand on her head 
And she'll fall on her knees. 
She is a 
daisy, sets them all crazy, 
They laugh and the/ shout till you'd think they 
-would burst. 
(
Repeat.) 
I 
brought my brother, his wife and her mother, 
To the theatre, so they could mate her, 
When she came out you'd think they would ate her, 
They shouted and yelled a 
horrible way. 
When poor Delia heard it she looked with surprise, 
From the trapeze I 
thought she would fall, 
She turned a 
flip-flap, bounced around on her back, 
Ah, my! how the people did bawl! 
But you should see Delia, etc,

Providence, R. I. 
Price 40 cents. 
I 
LOVE a 
fellow nice and sweet, 
A beautiful brunette, 
He is not swellish, but he's just 
A 
darling, you can bet ; you bet; 
His form is beautiful and straight, 
lie has a 
manly air, 
And then lie has a 
lovely head 
Of black and curly hair. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, he is just a 
darling duck,' 
My Charlie, sweet and fair ; 
The dearest thing in life to me 
Is Charlie's curly hair. 
He has a dark arid piercing eye, 
A 
killing black mustache, 
And when he promenades the street 
He cuts a " nobby " dash ; you bet; 
The girls they all are after him, 
For them he does not care, 
Ahho' they often compliment 
his black and curly hair. 
Oh, he is, etc. 
Together we go out to ride 
Behind a 
trotter fast ; 
You ought to see us on the road, 
We never are the last; you bet; 
We " shoot " past all the single teams, 
Oft beat a " fancy pair," 
And all the time I'm thinking of 
My Charlie's curly hair. 
Oh, he is, etc: 
He calls to see me twice a 
week, 
And brings nice things to eat, 
Which he lakes from the pockets of 
His clothes made up so neat; you bet; 
And when he bids me sweet " good night," 
He whispers of an heir 
That we may have in future years, 
With black and curly hair. 
Oh, he is, etc.

Words by JOE PETTINGILL. Music by CHAS. DOCRSTATER. 
As sung by the AMERICAN FOUR. 
W E 
got a 
day off to see our girls, they live in yonder 
cot, 
The number on the door is one hundred and forty-four 
And the place we've not forgot, 
'Tis Master Johnson's birthday, and the figs have got 
• 
a 
spree, 
With a 
band of music playing, we'll dance out on the 
green. 
Come out here, Obey Primrose, come out, you little 
queen, 
Come out here, Obey Primrose, and dance here on the 
green. 
CHORUS. 
We'll drive the gospel engine, 
We'll drive dull care away, 
We'll sing and dance with hearts so light, 
While the band does sweetly play. 
When we go out to promenade we make the white folks 
smile, 
Arm- in-arm we go along, you bet we put on style, 
Down on the green where we'll be seen, we'll make the 
leather shake, 
Hand in hand ! we lead. them all a 
walking for the cake. 
Put on style, Obey Primrose, I'll do just as I 
please, 
Put on style, Cloey Primrose, and we'll dance here on 
the green. 
We'll drive the gospel engine, etc.

MAJOR MAGOOZLUM. 
Written by W ASH. FAVOR for the " Irish Emperors," FAVOR and 
SHIELDS. 
W E 
are two gallant soldier boys 
That you very seldom meet; 
And though we never refuse a 
drink, 
We were never known to treat. 
We work the lunch routes every day, 
And get taffy on a 
stick, 
From the fellows that's fly, they give us the guy, 
But we're never known to kick. 
CHORUS. 
Major Magoozlum, just from Jerusalem, 
Where we've been training the Turks how to fight; 
They call us two guagers, the Judge and the Major, 
But still we go mashing the girls all night. 
We never get cranky, for Moody and Sankey 
Told us it was a 
sin; 
We never do fight, if ever we're tight, 
But at our work we begin. 
We draws the cans from under our coats, 
And drain the kegs for beer; 
We drink it quite sly, and wink our left eye, 
Then walk off on our ear. 
Major Magoozlum, etc.

CHARLES ATJGIISTUS WILLIAM BROWN. 
SONG AND DANCE. 
Written and sung by ARCHIE W HITE. 
I'm a 
genteel nobby little nig, 
A 
funny, frisky boy, 
I'm dancing, singing all the day, 
The ladies' pet and joy. 
I'm number one on style, you know, 
On that you bet your pile, 
And my name is Charles Augustus William Brown. 
CHORUS. 
So I'm bound to beat the style of all the " mashers," 
That's the reason I'm so nobby and so dashing, 
I'm a 
loose and careless little nig, 
Look out for me, I'm bad, 
And my name is Charles Augustus William Brown. 
I'm always to be seen upon 
The fashionable parade; 
My fascinating figure 
Throws all others in the shade. 
All the darlings they go crazy, 
As they see me pass along, 
For they're sweet on Charles Augustus William Brown.

I 
COULD TELL IT IF I 
FELT IT IN THE 
DARK. 
As sung with great success by JAMES GRAY. 
THERE is a 
thousand funny things a 
comic singer sings, 
To you no doubt revealing, 
And really on my word it is seldom that I've heard 
A 
song that touches on the art of feeling. 
There is a 
power, understand, in the grip of the hand, 
As one man to another may remark. 
And oft you'll hear them say of the things they see by 
day— 
I 
could tell it if I 
felt it in the dark. 
CHORUS. 
I 
could tell it if I 
felt it in the dark, 
I 
could tell it if I 
felt it in the dark ; 
I 
like it very much, I 
know it by its touch, 
I 
could tell it if I 
felt it in the dark. 
Sometimes we chance to hold some silver or some gold, 
That may be the case with many ; 
But he is very poor who never from his store 
Can afford to finger more than a 
penny. 
Sometimes we have to spend and ofttimes to lend, 
And all of us do like a 
jolly lark ; 
But what so be the coin on which -my fingers join, 
I 
could tell it if I 
felt it in the dark. 
I 
could tell it, etc. 
The other day I 
chanced to meet a 
maiden fair and 
sweet, 
Beneath an old tree so shady, 
She pledged to me her vow, I 
will not tell you now; 
Some day I 
mean to wed that little lady. 
I 
tell you it is bliss to steal from her a 
kiss 
While roaming together in the park, 
And as my arm was placed in a 
circle round her waist, 
For I'm always in to have a 
jolly lark. 
I 
could tell it, etc. 
PAIR KATRINA, AND CARROTTY BEN. 
Written expressly for HARRY STAN WOOD, by the late J. B. Muurxx. 
On, list to me while I 
relate, 
The sad, untimely, cruel fate 
Of a 
galliant youth with earrotty hair, 
Who loved a 
German maiden fair. 
His name I 
cannot mentu-en, 
But the neighbors called him Carrotty Ben 
And through the country far and wide, 
All knew Katrina Kroutzeuklyde. 
CHORUS. 
Then list to the mournful tale I 
tell 
Of a 
love-sick youth, what him befell, 
how false Katrina, fat and fair, 
Daceived poor Ben with the carrotty hair. 
'Twas at a 
German pic-nic ball, 
That CArrotty Ben in love did fall, 
With the false Katrina, fat and fair, 
And waltzed and ‘polkald with her there, 
He told his love, and with a 
smile, 
She answered in Teutonic style : 
`• Mine boy, I 
loves you, more as good," 
And so the matter was understood. 
So list, etc. 
Now Carrotty Ben without good sense, 
Rushed in and went to much expense ; 
He bought Katrina silks and rings, 
And lots of other curious things ; 
But on the day they were to wed, 
She fell down stairs and broke her head ; 
Then Carrotty Ben he felt so queer, 
lie drank a 
barrel of lager beer. 
Then list, etc. 
Now Carrotty Ben reolved to die, 
So he built a 
balloor aryl soared so high ; 
Then out he jumped with a 
fearful lurch, 
And fell on the 9,pire of a 
country church. 
The steeple run him through and through, 
And he sticks there still where all can view ; 
The sun has dried him very plain, 
And they use him now for a 
weather-vane. 
CHORUS. 
Now this was the tale I 
had to tell 
Of Carrotty Ben, what him befell; 
So lovyers all whatever you do, 
Beware the wiles of a 
German Jew.

W HEN I 
landed at Castle Garden, 
About ten years ago, 
I 
made my home in a 
tenement house, 
In Cherry street below. 
'Twas there I 
got acquainted 
Wid a 
German girl so gay, 
It was only six months after, 
She named my wedding day. 
CHORUS.. 
Ring a wreath of roses, 
We'll ring a 
wreath for thee, 
All the little children 
Sang so sweet to me ; 
Ladies came in carriages, 
With presents and bouquets, 
To little Michael Callihan, 
Upon his wedding day. 
It was on a 
Saturday evening, 
With laugh and merry shout, 
The boys and girls in the neighborhood, 
So gayly did turn out ; 
The old folks dressed their very best, 
And had funny things to say 
To Mike and Lena Callihan, 
-Upon their wedding day. 
Ring a 
wreath of roses, etc. 
There was August Schmitt and Kunkle, 
And Henry Cisebnyer, 
With all my wife's relations, 
And Cohn, the old clothes buyer. 
My brothers, Pat and Danny, 
Wid the ladies danced the glide, 
But the Germans tried to kill them when 
They tried to kiss the bride.

wreath of roses, etc.

THERE'S a 
letter in the candle, 
And it points to baby mine; 
Nancy Lee has broke the crystai 
To the watch upon the Rhine ; 
Kitty Clyde has pinched her feet, 
To keep herself up in the style - 
And Ben Bolt has stole the waterfall 
Of gentle Annie Lisle. 
I 
am sitting on the stile to- day, 
A 
hundred in the shade, 
With old Muldoon the solid. man, 
Of Patrick's day parade. 
He tried one day to stop a 
ball, 
With Spaulding at the bat, 
But a 
fielder caught him on the nose, 
And busted Muldooli's hat. 
Put my little shoes away, 
When the swallows homeward fly ; 
The man up in the moon will laugh, 
To see the well run dry. 
Oh Mollie dear, will you he true, 
When I 
am far at sea ? 
And don't be flirting in the park 
With the fellow that looks like me, 
Charley Ross has been discovered, 
Where the leaves begin to fall; 
Dennis Kearney lost his hatchet, 
But he done, it for a 
stall. 
He left his dray in Frisco, 
For to elevate his means, 
And Yankee Doodle filled him up, 
'With Boston pork and beans. 
Grandpa's clock has just been buried, 
You will miss it now it's gone, 
For they'll never resurrect it, 
Till old Gabriel blows his horn. 
The devil's dream of little Maud, 
The organ-grinders test, 
The silver threads,among the gold, 
Will have to take a 
rest.

NICE YOUNG GIRL FROM IIARLMI. 
Written by SAM DEVDRE. 
NOT long ago, while riding down 
In a 
car to the lower end of town, 
A 
gal got in who was dressed in brown, 
She was a 
nice young girl from Harlem. 
Her style was great—could not be beat— 
I 
winked at her, she smiled so sweet, 
I 
walked right up and took a 
seat 
By this nice young girl from Harlem. 
I 
spoke and said I 
meant no harm, 
She carried a 
book upon her arm, 
She said her farther owned a 
farm, 
This nice young girl from Harlem. 
She said she was going to meet her pa, 
Her little brother and dear mamma, 
She was " giving me taffy " and " 
This nice young girl from Harlem. 
We left the car and took a 
cruise, 
I 
swore this girl I'd never lose, 
Bought lager beer and seventeen stews 
For this nice young girl from Harlem. 
In about two hours she got her fill, 
Then asked me to loan her a 
ten-dollar bill, 
Said she'd come back—but I'm waiting still 
For this nioo young girl from Harlem.

We came for to sing you a 
song, 
We'll try our best for to please you, 
And we promise we'll not keep you long.

To tell you of all our misfortune,

If any of you want for to marry, 
And settle completely for life,

Boil your eggs and your coffee and tea, 
We'll be easy and quiet and loving, 
For two lonely widows are we.

THE POOR WORKING GIRLS, 
Burlesque on " Many Can Help One," by Fnewit FIELDS. 
NEw sayings we hear every day in the week, 
And one-half I 
believe to be lies. 
While the rich man is feasting on peanuts each day, 
The poor man is starving on pies. 
I'll sing of the.poor working girls in my song, 
Who can't afford silk dresses to buy, 
Their clothes are all sunburnt, their false teeth in pawn, 
To get money their eyebrows to dye. 
CHORUS. 
Remember my sayings when you are dead drunk, 
And counting your dimes by the penny. 
Remember you have suspenders and chest protectors as 
well, 
While the poor working girl hasn't any. 
In walking through the business street of this great town, 
These poor girls you will meet by the way ; 
Working from seven in the morning till eight o'clock at 
night, 
And all for ten dollars a 
day. 
It's a 
shame in a 
country that owns she is free, 
That assistance there cannot be lent, 
The poor girls have large families of children to support. 
I 
hope I 
don't intrude.

Mary, the Walker. 
Written expressly for INInurtr3r & l'amai by FRANK 
Ant..—" Biddy, the Ballet Girl." 
I 
am in love with a 
bouncing fat girl, 
Who is known all over creation; 
She beats the life out of Harrigan's Mary Ann, 
Or Dr. Landis for a 
good educwion, 
A masher she is called on the stre&t, 
In the " Black Crook " she does the statues ; 
But lately she has cancelled all dates, 
And is off her nut on walking matches. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, her tront name she says it is Ma', 
And she is a 
bouncing fat fairy, 
It is no use to talk, she's a 
daisy to wa:k, 
She has the score-board all markeel with long 
streaks of chalk. 
As around on the track she goes creep; 
And time to ay., music keeps beating, 
The men they all &lout, " Give it up, you're too 
stout 1" 
But Mary sticks out to the finis. 
Next Monday night she starts out 
To try and beat Harriman and Ennis, 
And if they don't do better than before, 
I'm sure that their names will be Dennis 
Next season she goes out with me, 
Then I'll he proud as a 
lord, 
No danger or my trunks getting stuck, 
Fr Mary will walk off with the board. 
Oh, her fro-t.i name, cto 
TILE GOOSE WITH THE GOLDEN EGG. 
Written by BOBBY N EWC031B. 
Sung by CHAS. H. 
DuNciar. 
W HEN I was of age my father he left 
To me quite a 
snug little sum ; 
He says—" Now, my boy, good sense please employ, 
And remember you've reached twenty-one." 
My friends when they heard of what had °warred, 
How they hastened to borrow or beg; 
For I 
flew a 
high kite, and they said, when in sight— 
" 
He's the goose with the golden egg." 
To my utmost surprise I 
attracted all eyes, 
And people inquired my name, 
Who a 
few months before, pronounced me a 
bore, 
And of my dress and my features made game. 
They'd laugh when I'd joke, with me dine, drink, or 
smoke, 
To my face they were dumb as a 
keg; 
But when I'd turn my back, how they'd laugh and they'd 
clack, 
At the goose with the golden egg. 
The girls all so fair, admired my hair, 
It was auburn— before it was red; 
They spoke of my style, drooped their eyes when I'd 
smile, 
And mammas marked me fit to be wed. 
Their daughters they sighed, and some their hair dyed, 
I 
was loved by Jane, Martha and Meg; 
My presents they took, and they all tried to hook— 
The poor goose with the golden egg. 
But a 
day came at last, I'd been living too fast, 
Run in debt and my money all flown ; 
Where'er I 
would call, they'd let me wait in the hall, 
And the message I'd get—" Not at home." 
They'd giggle and jeer, where'er I 
appeared, 
Pass me by with a 
nod or a 
sneer; 
For the goose it was dead, and the egg turned to lead, 
I 
had bought my experience dear. 
Now my subject of rhyme may just be in time, 
For the world I 
don't care a 
peg; 
But what I 
would say—I 
was once in nay day, 
A 
poor goose with a 
golden egg.

THE APOLOGY TO O'REILLY. 
NOT a 
hundred yards from where I 
std, 
In this our glorious Union land, 
Is kept a 
first-class liquor stand 
By a 
man whose name's O'Connor. 
There's a 
man who's known both near and ear, 
Who attends to Mike O'Connor's bar; 
Who, in our late war received no scar, 
And his name it is O'Reilly. 
Beneath our banner's starry wave, 
There's not a 
man fought half so brave, 
Or half the money for whiskey gave, 
As did McDermott. 
O'Connor's bar-room blazed with light 
On that eventful, bloody night 
That McDermott had the fearful fight 
With O'Reilly. 
With sleeves rolled up McDermott stood, 
And vowed he'd die before he would 
Say the slightest word that could, 
In any manner, be misconstrued 
Into an apology to O'Reilly. 
With a 
frowning brow and flashing eye, 
O'Reilly collared a 
glass of rye, 
Which he devoured without a 
sigh, 
Then turning to McDermott, said, 
" 
You alchoholic vat, you drunken loon ! 
You've no more sense than a 
gossoon !" 
"Be Heavens ! 
I'll make you change your tune," 
Says McDermott. 
McDermott went for O'Reilly's nose, 
And on it planted fearful blows, 
Till o'er his eye a 
shanty rose, 
Erected by McDermott. 
O'Reilly fell into a, swoon, 
With his head jammed in a 
big spittoon, 
And dreaming of Barnum's big balloon, 
The polie'e came 
and afired he gang. 
CHARMING ADULCIANA. 
Words and music by AncniE WniTz and ELLA ESMOND. 
On ! here I 
am at last, 
On time I 
try to be 
To meet my Adulciana dear, 
And here she'll surely be. 
But why she does not come 
I 
really cannot see, 
For every night she meets me here 
To sing and dance with me. 
CHORUS. 
Oh ! this is really provoking, 
(Sym.) 
With love I'm almost choking, 
(
Sym.) 
I 
am always happy 
And gay as I 
can be ; 
A- singing and a 
dancing 
Wherever I 
may be. 
Oh ! here I 
am, my Jimmie, 
Right straight from home I 
came ; 
You've waited half an hour or more 
But me you must not blame. 
That rascal, Pete, you see, 
Has just been here again; 
But I've come here to dance with you 
For we've got it on the brain. 
For we'll sing and dance together, 
For we're as light as a 
feather, 
We are always happy 
And gay as we can be; 
Singing and a 
dancing 
Wherever we may be.

THE FLANNEL MOUTH MICK. 
Written by W ILLIAM W ELCH of Simmons and Slocum's Minstrels. 
I KNOW you'll have pity 
When you hear what I 
say— 
The way I 
have been treated 
By the blackguards each day, 
Who stand on the corners, 
As I 
pass them by, 
You can hear them say plainly, 
Arrah, " stag the old guy." 
CHORUS. 
Oh, they yell out, " You terrier, 
Go shoot that hat quick !" 
They call me a 
chow and 
A 
flannel mouth mick. 
The other day while a- walking 
I 
went down the street, 
A 
charming young damsel 
By chance I 
did meet; 
Says T, '• You look charming, 
Ah, cushla ma vick ;"_ 
Says she, " Drop on yourself, 
You flannel mouth mick." 
Oh, they yell oat. etc. 
When election day comes, 
I 
know what they'll say— 
" 
How are you, Mr. McGuinness, 
How are you I 
good day. " 
They'll hand me a 
ticket, 
Say, " Go vote it, now quick—" 
I'm a 
gentleman then, 
And no flannel mouth mick. 
Oh, they yell out, etc.

O'REILLY'S RAFFLE. 
Words by 
oux PEASLEY. Sang with great sugoess by We, 
PEASLEYS. 
.7ell you of a 
jolly time 
'We had while at O'Reilly's raffle, 
Some were dancing, some were singing, 
Others making lots of fun. 
Some were dancing with their partners, 
Others kissing in the corners, 
Music playing, -whiskey flying, 
At O'Reilly's raffle. 
We were called up to the bar, 
We took a 
drink with Paddy O'Alar, 
Mickey Flynn, who had the most, 
He got up and gave a 
toast. 
CHORUS. 
Here's good luck to all the party— 
James Muldoon and Biddy McCarty. 
Michael Dolan, Teddy Regan, 
Danced the dust out of the floor. 
Here's to all the pritty ladies— 
Katy Mack, the two O'Bradys, 
We won't forget the time we had 
While at O'Reilly's raffle. 
We played all games and danced all dances. 
From the break-down to the lancen;, 
Cracking jokes and tellling stories, 
The girls all were in their glory. 
Some were eating, some were thinking, 
Some were sleeping, some were drinking, 
Others shaking for the turkeys, 
At O'Reilly's raffle. 
Tiien the ruction soon began, 
'ills-as woman to woman, and man to man, 
Broken chairs began to fly, 
One struck me right over my eye. 
CHORUS. 
Music playing, whiskey flying, 
Some were laughing, some were crying, 
Others taking off their coats, 
And getting ready for a 
fight. 
The girls they began a- squealing, 
The big blaguards they had no feeling, 
It it right and left they went, 
Aul busted O'Reilly's raffl?..

SWEET JENNY 
THAT PLAYED THE WELCH HARP. 
My name is Dan Largan, 
Cockolortun, Cock Lane, 
I 
came from Llangoillin, 
A land far away ; 
With my bead near turned, 
And my heart full of fear, 
To seek a 
Welch lassie, 
But can't find her here. 
CHORUS. 
Her name it is Jenny, 
So neat mid so sharp, 
She came front North Wales, 
And she plays the Welch ITarp, 
I 
courted sweet Jenny, 
Six months and three days, 
I 
sat by her side, 
And she paved the sweet lays, 
Till a 
man with a 
banjo 
Came strolling that way, 
He saw my sweet lassie, 
And bore her away. 
Her name it is Jenny, dre. 
I'd told her I 
loved her, 
As true as the stars; 
I 
thought her a 
Venus,. 
But she turned out a 
Mars; 
She scattered my hopes, 
With one sinale blow, 
She tingles her harp, 
To a 
nasty banjo. 
Her name it is Jenny, &e. 
If ever I 
meet him, 
As sure as the dead. 
smash his old banjo, 
And the crown of his head. 
As for false Jenny, 
i11 leave her to die. 
Far leaving Dan Largan, 
The 4auderino• boy. 
Her name it is Jenny, dm

THE HANDSOME PAGE. 
My name is Tommy Quatter, 
I 
run twenty years of age, 
And all about Belgravia 
I 
am known as the handsome page; 
When I 
walk out with Missis, 
The people all do stare, 
And \veil they might, or what a 
look, 
We are a 'lobby pair. 
CHORUS. 
I'm very fond of picking 
At a 
little bit of chicken, 
A 
little hit of Turkey, 
Or a 
little Lit of Ham; 
And isn't I 
a

At a

do, 
And if you was a 
Page Boy, 
Why you would wish it too.

the kitchen the other night, 
One of them I 
did see, 
A picking of the chicken 
Which of course belonged to me. 
I'm very fond, c!,:c 
When we have a

That's the time for me, 
The Jam and the Oranges 
Just suit me to a

There's one thing that I

You will agree I'm sure 
That's when the fellow's had enough, 
He can't eat ally more.

SWELLS OF THE DAY". 
Comic Song, by DEN COLLINS, Esq. 
Sung by PAT ROONEY. 
Copyrighted, 1b70, by CLINTON T. 
DE W ITT'. 
Now a 
comical song I'm going to sing, 
And I 
think you'll agree with me too, 
It's about the young men we every day meet, 
And the facts I 
believe are all true. 
They'll stand on the corner for twenty-four hours, 
They'll wink, and they'll blink, and they'll stare ; 
With Sherman House toothpicks and three-cent cigars, 
And bad hair oil all over their hair. 
CHORUS. 
• They are the swells of the day, 
Oh, that's what the police all say ; 
Their gold watch is brass, their diamond 
S' are glass, 
But still they're the swells of the day. 
They'll hang around our large hotels, 
A 
burden to the city ; 
To see them on a 
rainy day, 
Wouldn't move your pocket to pity. 
They'll snit tobacco all over the walk, 
I 
wish they were in Jerusalem ; 
There is Augustus, George, Girard, and Oliver, 
• 
And Don Pedro alamagozlems. 
CHORUS. 
They're par excellence, 
I 
wish they'd leave the town ; 
Why can't they go out West, 
Or where they can't be found ? 
Oh my, them second-hand hats, 
Look dizzier every day ; 
I 
wish they were buried with Brigham Young, 
Ten thousand miles away. 
They'll bow to every lady 
And they'll try and look their best ; 
They'll button up that linen duster 
To hide their old-time vest. 
They'll go in a 
bar-room, step up to the counter 
And drink when they know they can't pay ; 
If the bartender murmurs " Please settle that round," 
They'll wink their brunette eye and say— 
CHORUS. 
By-and-by, by-and-by, they'll say 
" 
Charge it," and then hurry to the door;

rid a 
gay young chap from Erin and they call me Dandy Ntt, 
I 
wear a 
green regalia, a 
harp, and shamrock in my hat; 
I 
joined the Ancient Order; we're the boys that looked so gay 
When we marched in the procession on last St. Patrick's day, 
And oh, such music, such music, such music as we had all day, 
Such music, such music, how sweet the bands did play. 
Mirth Ma ,dnnis was chief marshal and he rode a 
fine white horse, 
With a 
sword and sash beside him, oh! boys he was the boss ! 
With a 
smile on every feature. and a 
uniform so gay, 
The ladies all smiled on him as we marched along the way, 
And oh, such winking, such winking, such winking as was 
there that day, 
Such winking, such winking, they winked the livelong day, 
'Twas just below the common we fell into the line, 
With flags and banners flying, the day being nice and fine, 
The band played Garry Owen and then the Mulligan Guard; 
And we carried the harp of Erin beside the stripes and stars. 
And oh, such tramping, such tramping, such tramping as was 
there that day, 
Such tramping, such tramping all through the mud and clay. 
When we marched in open order faith ' twould make you laugh 
to see 
The little stick lea cripple keephyr step with Mick Magee; 
When we come before the marshal's house they brought us ta 
a 
halt, 
And they gave us just ten minutes for to go and get our malt. 
And oh, such whiskey, such whiskey, such whiskey as was 
drank that day, 
Such whiskey, such whiskey, the bar-rooms made it pay. 
Then when we were disbanded as quick as you could wink 
We all bounced down to Kelley's for to have a 
drop to drink, 
The whiskey punch flew lively for the liquor was so rare, 
In less than fifteen minutes divil a 
sober man was there. 
And oh, such drinking, such drinking, such drinking as was 
there that night, 
Such drinking, such drinking, the boys got awful tight. 
Mike Connors and Pat Cronin then got into a 
dispute, 
Mdte said his bat was finest, and Pat slapped him on the :moot, 
„ 
Then broken heads were plenty, the blood ran freely there, 
Myself and long Dan Carty had to waltz off on our ear. 
And oh, such fighting, such fighting, such fighting as the boys 
had there, 
Such fighting, such fighting, ' twas like an Irish fair.

DANCING IN THE MOONLIGHT. 
SONG AND DANCE. 
As Sung by LIZZIE LA 
GRANGE, of Howe's Circus. 
One pleasant Summer's evening 
Some lady friends of mine 
Had given L 
moonlight pie-nic, 
And I 
was asked to join. 
Tim time and place was stated. 
And finally we met ; 
How anxiously I 
waited, 
I 
never cau forget. 
The time came round and there I 
found 
That all was bright as sunlight ; 
The ladies fair with 11 
Were dancing in the moonlight. 
crioitt:S. 
Balance to your partners, then the music played. 
Ala natal corners, all promenade, 
The sweet one then came to me 
With smiles as bright as sunlight. 
But soon we were both happy there, 
While dancing in the moonlight. 
But soon we left the dancers, 
And sought a 
shady nook, 
And ‘vhile they danced the lancers, 
A ', Ovate chat we took ; 
The music from a 
distance. 
Came waned on the breeze, 
'Twits food tor our loves cadence, 
And set our hearts at ease. 
We spoke of love, the stars above' 
That showered on us their bright light, 
In dusk and dew, I 
bent me low 
And kissed her in the moonlight. [ Balance, itc. 
The (lancing now was over, 
And here and there was found, 
The gentle love and lover 
Conversing on the ground, 
But where was me and mine own, 
Unnoticed by the rest. 
In bliss until the unknown's 
Sweet head lay on my breast, 
She to my question answered yes, 
Which almost killed me outright, 
A memory bright of that sweet night, 
Comes dancing in the moonlight. 
Balance &c. 
LITTLE ROSIE MAY. 
Oh, the summer has come, 
With flowers in bloom, 
The birds sing out their lay ; 
Where the grass grows green, 
My rise is seen, 
A walking day by day. 
She has a 
roguish jet black eye, 
Which brightens when I 
Say, 
I 
love but you, and only you, 
My Ii tie Rosie May. 
CHORUS. 
My little Rosie May, 
None 
as e'er so gay. 
Yor her voice is sweet, and she dresses neat, 
My little Rosie May. 
You should have seen 
This little queen, 
A walking down Broadway, 
With a 
winning smile, 
And a 
pleasing style, 
To steal your heart away. 
The gents they turn to look at her, 
And this is what they say, 
She's a 
charminw. belle, 
And she knows it 
My little Rosie May. 
My little Rusk( May, 4c. 
Now I 
take Miss Rose 
To all the shows, 
To parties and to ride; 
And where e'er I 
be, 
You are sure to see, 
Miss Rosie by my side. 
She can sing a 
song, 
Or dance a 
jig, 
The piano she can play; 
There is none so fair, 
None can compare, 
With little Rosie May.

ONz day while walking down Broadway 
I 
met my cousin Joe, 
He asked me then if I 
with him 
To Central Park would go; 
With my consent we then did start, 
And reached the lake at three, 
We took a

were pass'd by Joe and me.

Sailing on the lake, 
To the music of the birds, 
The rippling of the waters, 
And the sound of loving words. (

On our return we took a 
stroll, 
And soon did reach the mall, 
When from the distance music sweet 
Upon our ears did fall; 
We sat and listened to the hand 
Beneath a 
hawthorn tree, 
While gentle breezes carried words 
Of love from Joe to me. 
Sailing on the lake etc. 
Now Joe has asked me to be his, 
Of course I 
won't refuse, 
And pa has given his consent— 
This chance I 
must not lose; 
And when some day at Central Park 
The lake you go to see, 
I 
know you'll whisper words of love, 
Like my dear Joe and me.

My love she is a

About her face no paint is seen,

I

And as we sat in the parquette, 
how nice I 
felt I 
scarce can say ; 
The bell it rang, the curtain rose, 
A man came out in spangled clothes, 
Entrancing me with dashing style, 
While to my love he gave a 
smile.—Oh. 
She never flirts, ke. 
To see my love next day I

To pop the question was my intent, 
Alas ! poor me, I

To hear she'd gone in a

did squall, 
She'd took her trunks and her waterfall„ 
I 
seized my hat, to the show I 
ran, 
But she'd eloped with the circus nian.—Oh. 
Take warning boys, and don', you go, 
With your sweet heart to a

And you'll never see your girl again.
