Dear Carl:
 
About a year and a l
ial
.f ago the F lk Arts Program of the National
 
Endovmwnt for the Arts funded a Yup' ik literature and photcr-
graphy project at St. F
-
Iary'ss.  One of the results of the proj-
ect was a book called ThrquWi VUD' ik Eve&. Last week the national
 
funding panel for the Folk Arts Program not here.  They reviewed
 
that project, among o
 and were h4 ably Impressed with the
 
book.  Weveral of the panel mambers
 favorably and
 
asked if they could h
ave d es.
 
Roy Helms, who is executive director of the Alaska State Council
 
on the F
arts, tells as that the only copies of Throucai 1
i
'uplik
 
Eves w
1iich have = * been distributed are probably at

vista.
 
if you have a quantity of these books on hanc , •
soul% you P

consider this an order for eight copies of °

laou(4h Yup' ik Eyes?
  
if you could have someone send them to me at the followi mj
 
address, along with an invoice, I
'll 
 make sure that they get to

Dear Dave:
 
Enclosed i
s
s ethe material you asked for at the Panel meeting in
 
reference to the Snake River Regional Studies Center in Idaho.
 
I
've just xeroxed their Final Descriptive Report, so let me
 
give
s you some backup information on the grant.  it was awarded
 
back in April of 19761 $1,080 to the College of Idaho to sup-
port "demonstrations of folk arts related to the cattle industry
 
in conjunction with a land use conference".  The grant ended
 
in June of 1976.
 
you might be interested in writing to Donne
, Parsons, Director of
 
the Regional Studies Center for a copy of the proceedings of
 
the conference.  We only have one copy here, and as it has little
 
to do with our grant to the m I did not bother to xerox it and
 
send it along (
it's a bit lengthy).  of course, if you'd like
 
a copy and have any problems getting it from them give me a
 
ring and I
'll ship it out.
 
Enjoy your summer, and I'll M W you in the fall.
 
Cordially,

Executive Director
 
Knoxville Dogwood Arta Festival
 
301 Ch urch Avenue, S.W.
 
Knoxville, Tennessee 37901
 
L
)ear Mr
r. Falls:
 
`hank you for your recent letter.
 I am certainly happy that
 
the Dogwood Festival was the success you describe, and I am
 
very sorry twat I couldn't join you for the event.
 
I ass hoping in the next few weaks to be able to send a con-
sultant through your area who would be able to call upo n you
 
and discuss the Folk Arta program and its guidelines (
i &ich
 
are cuttently und er revision) .  in the meantime, I ma enclosing
 
application forms which should, as you know, be retu r
ned to us
 
in triplicate along with the green card.
 Our neh-t u
xacxor ing
 
deadline is July 15 for projects scheduled to start ax XMd the
 
first of the year.
 if that is too moon for you, you c =ld
 
sukaait by  
ptember 15, a date set for projects eWieculed to
 
start April 1.
 
In terms of your last application, our advisory panel felt the
 
project description abeMed a lack of expertise in planning and
 
development of the folk and traditional part of your pr gtam.
 
They were also concerned that there was apparently no pee on
 
on your staff qualified to clan and present the traditia m'
 
s
it of your festival with di
ne sensitivity to the needs of
 
the folks.
 (There :
may, of course, L
uave been several such people;
 
h
aver, this was not clear in t
1he application.)
 in general,
 
the panel feels stron( ly that a I
)erson with either academic
 
br practical training
; in t:he special problems of -K
ablic presen-
tation of traditional culture should be involved in any ,
project
 
they fund, and they are bAppy to support the costs of hiring
 
such special. assistance.

Perhaps additional consultation with Lin d White would be h
+elo -
ful.  Another passibility is Joe Wilson, executive director of
 
the National council on the Traditional. Arts.  I
le can be reached
 
at 1346 Connecticut Avenue, N.W. , Washington, L.C.
 20036-
, 202/
 
296-0068.  
 Joe's mother lives gear Kn:)+-vi11e and he was brought
 
up in that general area; l
ie is a highly experienced folk festival
 
organizer and knows numbers of people in your J*articular neck of
 
the woods.
 
The panel felt additional reservations about the video-tape
 
portion of your application.  Frankly, they have begun to play
 
c
lown videotape, mince the results are so extremely chancy, both
 
in technical and directorial quality.  my corn personal advice
 
is that you leave videotaping out of any new application unless
 
you feel that it is absolutely emeential for your nee d and you
 
can send in a really ingressive suiple of the kind of t
uaterial
 
you would have videota p
ed,  As 2 may, the panel looks at all
 
videotape projects thiao days with a particularly ceatious eye.
 
Z shal
.lpprobably be in touch with you during the next few weeks
 
by telephone in order to set up a personal visit wither fr =
 
me or a represobtative.
 
Cordially,
 
Bergs Lomax Hawes
 
Director
 
Fo3k Arts Progra::i
 
P.S. Should you decide to r* W ly to our panel, you should
 
send along a fairly speeific account of just what hai4-ened
 
at your last festival, including performer s and craft
 
de monstrator's names, names of m.c. '
s
a and
. "Presenters", how the
 
day was scheduled and the like.  this would be really i
.
zxportant
 
to them.

 most of thew extremely entertaining as
 
well as so intrinsically difficult I have the reassuring feeling
 
that nobody else in the world would know quite how to do theca
 
either.  This relieves my mind considerably and allows me to

I really o

the Folk Arts panel's response to your p
ro
d to work up a
 
special presentation by the Revolutionary Road Company.  To
 
be absolutely m
eet, I simply forgot.  I did discuss the
 
idea with the Pa m'; they were not terribly enthusiastic
 
(feeling that the project overall fell outside the program's
 
guidelines) but were willing to consider an application to
 
cover tY

Dear Yuri Lyra:
 
it was pleasant talking with you the other day, even though I
 
could hear only every third ward or so.  I hope that enough of
 
my remarks to you got through to be reassuring as to the interest
 
of the panel in your project.
 
Overall, they thought it was an elegant Idea and well worked out,
 
and they were particularly impressed by the evi f
tece of strong
 
carrautity support.  They were also plAwand by the high quality
 
of the photographs and slic e.
 
rMey did, however , fekl that the ,
project w
ee awfully expensive
 
per se , and finally, aft " a good deal of 60btte , agreed to
 
award you $13,000/  14hey did not feel that your salaries were
 
out of line.  They did d
ent that the per diem was too high,
 
but I realized later on that the figure was for two people, so
 
that should not require revision.
 
It se ms to me that you should now just relax and lay your plans
 
for raising additional cash money on your return.  The $13,©00
 
is now yours (after, of course, approval by council and Nancy
 
f
lanks) and you can use it any way you like.  But you will, I
 
think, need more money if you w
e going to go to all the conw A
 
nities you outline . Perhaps the California Arts Council people
 
will a ms through , and I suggested to Y
iargery in an earlier con-
versation that you approach same of the Portuguese associations,
 
like the daryman's group and so on.  The I
-
Aw l also
 
that you try the Gulbenkain F
 An7
jdation ,
 but I ast sure that has
 
al msdy occurred to you.  Anyway . the $13,000 is enough to get
 
your project well started, it see m to me.

we felt that your being in the Asores ruts a different f
lexion
 
on the matter.  Still, it is r
ely crucial that you and/or
 
Margery make no public announa ment of this until after the
 
Council meets (August 12-13), a
ceoa
 ndation.  I have seen at
 
every Coun;ail meeting one or anot
r grant referred back to
 
panel for reconsideration.  Though the d-d
ances of this happening
 
to your application are about one in a million, it get everybody
 
here terribly upset it a story "leaks" out about a panel recom-
tion before t
he council has finally concurred.
 
Vast, I think it would really be better if you would possibly
 
S
inop by Washington and go over the final details add sign the
 
right version of your application.  we are working against a
 
d
Aadline, since it is the, end of our fiscal year, and the sooner
 
we get this one ,
put to bad and finishe d up, the better for all

 . Can you p

It was s

that a 34 a

$ 15,000, since ours is a matching I=ogras.  Finally, before

Dear Mr. M

Thank you for your letter of May 31 in which you detail your
 
estbod of search for a folklorist for the institute of Texan
 
Ciltures.  Since your letter arrived coincidentally with a
 
meeting of the Folk arts panel, I shcK#ed it to the panel members,
 
and they asked me to congratulate you c
an your thorough and
 
serious search.
 
The j
sanel concurs with so that you have assembled an outstanding
 
group of caruli d
e►tei, and they are sure that you will be able
 
to select f m
- a
!# w o them
, an individual who will be an effective
 
worker within the Institute.  They also feel that it would be
 
inappropriate,  (particularly given the excellence of the group
 
as a whole,) for the Folk Arts panel itself to r
id any
 
aprticular individual over any e
ither.  You are, of 008 =*, free
 
to ask for personal opinions from any panel nmdmr, j
jwt as you
 
will probably be asking for
 tions from the referees
 
named by the various candidates.
 
I assume that by now you have received the letter from our
 
grants office (wiled to you June 1, 1977) which confi=w the
 
funding of�

Dear Andy Nazell:
 
Thank you for your letter of enquiry.  I am enclosing c
yuide-
1ines from tvo different Endowment programs where you mick
it
 
be aide to seek support for your project of a film on the
 
Trinidadian steel
. drums.
 
As you will see, the programs (Folk Arts and Public Meida)
 
are based on different principles.  To su:a them up rather
 
briefly, Falk Arts considers the significance of the topic
 
proposed, the technical and folkloric expertise of the people
 
involved in the project, an.I the im-
,
-act of the project upon
 
the traditional cowmunity.  }
4e would be concerned about whether
 
or not the 1
JUr for r
M
rrs were getting adequate pay for their
 
services, wbether the finished film o
ld be widely available
 
both to Trinidadianss and black American audiences, and whether
 
your films would provide a
ccurate and substantive information
 
about the tradition.  Public Madda is essehtially concerned
 
with film as an art fora; the other factors stationed are of
 
secoondary+ importance to their advisory panel.
 
The above are :
limply suggestions that might help you in frw i
ang
 
your application to either program.
 
Then in Folk Arts terms at least, it seems to me your budget
 
is awfully steep.  We have only once given a grant for $50,000
 
and that was for a massive Bicentennial project.
 If you comae
 
to us, you wo*l.d simply have to scale it c an, either by
 
modifying your budget or raising more than half of the match.
 
Andy Narel.l

(My personal opinion is that your salaries are out of line
 
our Program just cannot s
leet the level of professional tees
 
custnmAry in the field.)  it is possible, however, that the
 
Meida Arta panel can afford bigger grants than we can; their
 
guidelines are new and I a
rse not yet familiar with them.
 
A final difficulty I should mention is that the rndowment 11
-l
ass
 
not frequently funded projects that take place outside the
 
United Statea.
 I think this could be overcome, however, in
 
your proposal write-up by stressing the inter-connections
 
between Trinidad and G.S. black culture.
 
Frankly, I thi
,rO you have a l
ong raw to hoe 3
.n front of you.
 
Raising money for me l
 a projects is a reA l
  
ly hard job these
 
days, but I wish you the beat of luck and hope that you will
 
call on us if we can he of further assistance.

It never rains but it pours.  The day after I wrote you about

r m a very fine folklorist
 
at the University of Pennsylvania
 i
ing a student of
 
i
ris for your project in the highest terms.  Her name is Carol
 
iilvernuna , and she has worked with Ra
 t 
 
kan and Gypsy groups in
 
various eastern cities, as I understand it.  She lives in New
 
York; her telephone nu
bs is 431E--0614.
 
Bill Pearson called me this afternoon; I informed hits again
 
that you would be in touch with him -- (816) 333-3506 -- and
 
took the liberty of telling him I was also submitting Carol
 
Silvezman's narae to you.  Perhaps you would want to split the
 
job between thew or either one could use theoother as consultant.
 
Actually, as I said in my previous letter, you are the one to
 
make the final decision.
 
I hoP
�e all goes well with your work, and that in our efforts
 
to bo helpful we are not putting you in a c

I think both of these young people are fine candidates and
 
agreable and interested people who could work: effectively
 
either separately or in tandem.

Dear Alexia:
 
.
here is the trip report I wrote up for Nancy after a day's
 
visit to the Cinnamensen school district in Now Jersey where
 
they are putting on a folk and traditional artistam.-in-
wools
 
project.  I hope so m of the observations will be helpful. in
 
,Aanning your follow-4n
.
,/
 
I mate to sound like a crackxvi record (and a " lf-serving one
 
at thatY), but Z s
tart to continue to urge you to locate really
 
experienced folklorists to work on all such .
proj
ects and,
 
hopefully, to direct the pCOqz9n,.  I think you've already seen
 
the beneficial effects of using l
 eople who have "been there
 
before" in terms of your research, and in the school situation,
 
t
aieir participation is even more crucial.
 
Oh4�d mY, Y'm so sorry you're doing to Now York when the Chicago
 
situation is just beginning to fl

can leave behind you, a caa-

T
lumk you for your letter.  I am enclosing a xerox c
opy of the
 
Folk Arts grants which were approved by the Arts Endowment's
 
Hational C
louncil at their most recent umeting.  1 hope these
 
brief descriptions will prove useful.
 
You application received a most thorough rswiew and dis masion
 
at the last Folk Arts pan * sooting.  fte panel has a difficult
 
time with educational projects at beat, since they feel that
 
they are: intrudinc  into the m
in of Health, Education and
 
'
Welfare.  Our forays into support of education to the folk arts
 
have bberefore been c all insocope and a bit tentative, general-
ly focussed more on denK mstration than Anstruction per se.
 
in sum, the panelists finally decided that your proposal, though
 
highly worthy, simply dial not fall into our area of action.
 
Specifically, they felt that the support of organized instruction
 
by professional or semi-professional teachers is outside our
 
ranee of competency, especially in view of our lix-a
ited Ounc3s.
 
Again, let r
ae emphasize that in no way was the panel critical
 
of the aims or r
aethods of your project, and l krx m they would
 
join me in wishing you well in your search for funding.

Dear Jo Jo aunt:
 
`
i
'hank you for your letter of May 20.  I believe Ms. Farrer did
 
return yourarproposal to you, since it was not fundable under
 
our c
juidelines, and it was such an elegant presentation she
 
though you might have need of it elsewhere.
 
I will of ocurse be happy to discuss the CE O application with
 
you or Mr. Lynch or anyone else you deem appropriate:.  However,
 
let me point out againtthat the Folk Arts program is small and
 
very narrowly foc-
-ussed.  we are unable to support projects of
 
the size and scope of the one you M an. as we simply do not
 
l
za
.ve the funds to do so.  Nor are we able to support evolving
 
and emergent art for am.  Our mission is strictly controlled by
 
our juidelines;  to
 3
 out and support the most traditional
 
of living artists in whatever ways aee a  ropriate.
 
Thus instead of funding powwows (an e mrgent form )
 we fund
 
documentation of traditional danv�s when tribal auth orities
 
request funds for doirV so.  Instead of funding exhibits of new
 
native t
unerican painters and sculptors, we support t
1ke teachings
 
of traditional skills by Older native experts in local tribal
 
arts centers.
 
.
Part of the Wsaoon
 are so specific in our goals is t
1lat the
 
evolving, neaw arts forms are funded through the Endommuent ` a 
Expansion Arts proclram, a pz
+ogr€ m that has far ?urger a budget

Dear Mr. Dick ":
 
Thank you for your letter.  Your application essentially asked
 
for funding for documentation of a umdo-lo W Native American
 
pow--wow and various q
tr m
aps as ethnic cultures to be
 
held on your campus.  The p
Aw "1 1a view was that Native American
 
pow—wows have been doctua
iented very f
 y and that they are
 
basically very similar in all pacts of the country.  They further
 
felt that doc umentat&on of craft activities would be bettw e
t
 
handled in situ fin s ue or in the ha m comm mities) rather than
 
on a univeraity campus, where s
t
'
+ass 0240ent
.s of staving would
 
necessarily cr
y in.
 
I hope this explains their rationale sufficiently.  You x
m
.=t
 
realize that this is a small program, and our funds must be
 
very judiciously managed in order to stretch, them a
mt the
 
vast numbers of folk arts l
,
�rmjects that we are aaksad to sul Vort.
 
For this reason alone , our panel has been looking oppecially
 
sharply at filta and video projects, all of which are so extaeraely
 
e
-x ensive.
 
Please feel free to enquire again, if you '
lave further questions.

almost upon us, I would appreciate it if you would take

I am horrified to realize how much time has 9 we by since I

a Y
4ational Council meeting and the task of preparing a smv
 
panel book have all intervende; still I am really embarrassed
 
to have delayed sending r
ay thanks to you for your cordial and
 
:
ouch appreciated hospitality.
 
I hope the Ci
 traditional artistse-in -

is still going along as beautifully an it w o the day I visited.
 
I a
ra sure it will turn out the great success I predicted �
tuw
i
 
Linda first told me about it.  As you may know, I was so in-
pressed by Linda's ,
plan that I asked her to send me a written
 
report which I could circulate to other interested school
 
districts.  It will be the first item in the informal news-
letter I intend to start this suuuter w
inch will circulate to
 
the state arts agencies.
 
Again, r
ay thanks for your warm hospitality, and please dive
 
my greetings to your husband and to Linda when you see her

Dear Marjorie:
 
Thank you for your good wishaso This is a fascinating, thoubh
 
brain-fatiguing job, and I shall look forward in another year
 
to returning to California and the a
.cac
ic life.
 
It was nice to meet with your husband, Frank Boles, though I
 
didn't realize t
he realtionship at the t
iara.  He is a most
 
pheasant and understanding gentlemen, and we had a cordial
 
meeting.  Since that time, I have gotten m me additional
 
information which may be of use to you.
 
As you will see from the enclosed program description of the
 
National Endo% went for the Humanities, the X W has a separate
 
program for out
,--port of archival ,
projects which I was unaware
 
of when Mr. Boles and I spoke.  Perhaps it would be worth a
 
letter of krxluiry from you to that particular program.
 
I realise the distinctions between the t
wo Endowments thesiselves
 
strike applicatns as arcane and irrational.  Some of theca are
 
laid uvon us by law and others have evolved
. historically (a
 
process not necessarily featuring logic).  I am taki=3 another

Dear Don:
 
Thank you for your letter and ym r efforts in our behalf.  I
 
am beginning to think that possibly a straight forward request
 
in the SERI newsletter .
-
aight be the s
urest and most effective
 
thing to do.  This might give us enough leads that we follow
 
up by telephone and get a rouVh fix on the size of the pooblem.
 
Nnother more coax licated possibility mig2it be to dive a ,mall
 
individual grant or contract to an ethnce i
sicologist at a
 
major university with a MATS line and have theme put a couple
 
of graduate students onto the problem.  it would seea
a to me
 
an interesting project at the IV
% level. if appropriately
 
supervis4e
Kl, as you suejc est.  I don't think such a survey could
 
be started
, until after the Spl
ste€ ber panel meeting; both Folk/
 
Ethnic and Folk
. Arts are up
, to their respective eye1wows
 
keeping up with the business we've already generated.
 
I
 
Ted Graeae has been in to see me several tLmetr about his various
 
current projects and he strikes me as too busy to take such a
 
survey on himself.  S ues I think it would have to be done
 
mostly by phone. the gentleman at Toronto would s
 to be out
 
of the running.  I have mat SoanJe Wade and Bruno Nettle and
 
know their work but he m wavew worl

you to stop by washington on your return in S

that we could talk over the situation as it will have develop-ed
 
by then?  I'd appreciate being able to consult with you.

Dear Dr. M eller:
 
Your proposal concerning an American l

We appreciate your thoughtful
. letter.  It is always gooc. to
 
hear that maple share our concerns for vaintaining the
 
strength of traiditonal cultures in the united States.  Unfor-
tunately, it is beyond the capacity of this .
program to mount
 
a nationwide effort such as the one you  roPose-
I a
re, however, enclosing a copy of our program guidelines for
 
you to look over so t
liat you can see the kind of projects we
 
can assist and the hark we are already undertaking.  V
ie have

mer of festivals
 
ewlebrating t
ree Am mican folk culturel heritage, a notable
 
example being the Regional America section of the 1976 Festival
 
of American Folkl.ife put on by the Smithsonian institution.
 
We are continuing an active program of financial and advisory
 
su,x
xport of workshops, festivals and demonstrations of folk
 
arts activities throughout the country.
 
It might also inta mst you to know that the Congress last year
 
paused a bill to set up an Arerican Folklife Center at the
 
Library of Congress; this Center is beginning its program
 
under the direction of Dr. Alan Jabbour who, I am sure, vmuld
 
be pleased to near from you concerning your suggestion.  You

Dear Mr. Swenson:
 
Mr. J
ohn Blaine of the Seattle Arts Cf
tuissi
.on reached me
 
this afternoon with the distressing news that our response
 
to the Seattle Folklore Society's litter of October 15th
 
never reached Miss Yee.
 
I male " a xerox of the letter that Claire Fmrrer sent
 
hiss Yee is October 29tht Miss F$rrer was at that time act-
LM as the Folk Arts Director pending my arrival in the
 
middle of Nov
 ember . As you will see, she tried repeatedly
 
to reach Miss Yee by tolep
b  to discuss the probl m with
 
her directly but was unable to get in touch.  Since her mows
 
was essentially discounWing she simply assumed that the
 
Society had dedi
.ded to seek funds elsewhere.
 
I am truly sorry about the mix-up.  I enclose for your future
 
use a copy of the Molk Arts program description and our dead-
line s
chedule for the coming year.  You wJ U see that our
 
panel 1
4miis itself to the support of traditi mol arts and
 
artists exclusively, on the grounds that other sections of
 
the f
it, such as the Expansion Arts program6 fund
 
larger conumity-wide programs.  For ex
ile, dm m M you
 
again ask us for assistance in funding the Northwest Regional
 
Folklife Festival, our panel would probably limit itself to
 
supporting the expenses of the traditional artists who partici-
pate in the broader Festival.  We are a very s
c
+
o
►all section of
 
-2—
 
the
 with a L Wted buclgett thuewswe prefer to fund
 
s Mll tightly focussed projects.
 
my telephone conversation with Mr. Blaine piqued my curioni
.ty
 
as to what the Folk Arts panel has funded in the state of
 
Washington.  A search of our files roveals the following
 
projects were funded for, or through* the Seattle Folklore
 
Society in 1974 and 1975.
 
$11 #000.00 for kinescoping four videotape archive
 
$17,710.00 for an hour videotape of Basque
 s
 
$10,00©.00 for the Northwest Regional Folklife i0s uval
 
Additionally, to have supported .
several
, other Washington
 
State: projects:  the Yak
kime (
through the Sm L
aaki
.n Research
 
institute), the Makah (
through X6cah Ca wn2
xioations Enter-
prise), the Colville confederated Tribes programs for artists
 
and the public through Vaited 2DdLana of All Tribes Foundation,
 
as well as a film series through K WS in Spokane.  We've spent
 
over $133,000 in the State of Washington since our Program
 
began in late 1974.
 
We look forward to a continuing relationship with your orgaa3-

Yes, indeed, an in-kind match is acceptable.  We will also
 
watch any other federal funds you have, providing they are
 
not from the 1-
imanities Endowment since we are the same at
 
one level of organization.  And, of course, we will match
 
State monies as well.
 
1 am a bit concerned about the honorarium to the groups. Do
 
you feel that $100 is sufficient?  This is, I suppoxo, in
 
addition to any travel and per diem expenses they might
 
encounter.
 
Our Panel would appreciate information concerning the groi n
s
 
you would propose to use.  we have a heavy demwul on our
 
funds and the Panel feels they mint direct their energies to
 
the most traditional artists.

Dear Sr. Gonzales:
 
Allow me first to thank you for your interesting proposal.
 
The Folk Arts Program in very anxious to be of assistance to
 
you in the presentation of your classic drama.  i
re d
ry, however,
 
require more information from you, and we need in turn to give
 
you information concerning what we can and cannot fund that is
 
too complex and lengthy to put in the form of a letter.
 
We have therefore asked a good friend, Sr. John Vincent from
 
the New M nieo Arts Commission in Santa fe to drive down to
 
see you and discuss the ,
problem.  I
le will bring with hire the
 
necessary application blanks and consult with you concerning
 
your budget.  Sr. Vincent has had such experience in filling
 
out government forms and understands our r
Ammisf Z a
wn sure you
 
will find him extremely helpful.  He will be c
al
f y
ou
 
within a fen days; if you should want to reach him in the
 
me Mtime, you could call him at (
 505) 527-2061.
 
we will .
look forcnard to receiving your completed application
 
and will hope to be able to be of assistance to Lois c
cckanches
 
de la Serna.
 
Yours very truly,

there are lots of people in the world whouldn't take it ont
 
we will need tLe following:

 a
 
copy of the organization's I

as a 501 or 509 non-profit organization.

cannot run longer than one year.
 
4)
 we Mould like to be sure that they have the consulta-

Al Ortiz or 1
4arta Weigel in the Anthrgp*10gy DG@Prt-

they need help of this kind.

Dear Mr. WiAson;
 
Thank you for your recant, informative letter concerning the
 
needs and concerns of Pit River Tribara r
to-a
lera.  it is apparent
 
theat a good deal of thought has gone into your proposal.  The
 
Folk Arts program is in syM
.)a
:thy with the desires of you and
 
your people to do the necessary reasarch An order to provide
 
documentation for future lands clai m cases.  However, it is
 
not a project we can support.  Ra m arch is more appropriately
 
addressed to the Humanities Endowleent.  I are enclosing a
 
brochure of theirs for you to s
:saro with your anthropologist
 
friend, Mr. Black.
 Perhaps the two of you will be able to
 
dee
m a project that would be a
}s
oling to the humanities
 
Endowment.
 
Z did note several items in your proposal that I'd like to
 
c
c
ent on.  Concerning language, the Center for Applied
 
Linguistics (1611 North Kent Street, Arlington, Virginia,
 
22209, 202/528-4312) '
t
eas recently received a grant from the
 
Humanities Endowment to work with
, native people in order to
 
write previously unwritten languages.  Perhaps you could
 
wrtie to Dr. William Leap at the tenter and see if #a could
 
be of '
hel p to you.  Dr. Leap is a fine linguist who has had
 
p
ride experience working with various Indian tribes.
 (You
 
might want to check with f
ir. Ro bert Gann, Comr;tissioner of
 
Indian Affairs, State of okl
.alho m, Oklahoma City, 73105 for
 
a reference on Dr. Leap.  Mr. Gana, himself an Indian, has
 
spo ke most highly of Dr. Leap and work he has c
lone with
 
Indian tri
p .
in Oklahoma.
 
Concerning Mythologies, Mu "C, Legends and Survival:  Those
 
Mr. Darryl Wilson

are items we may be of help with.  However, we'll need more
 
.
information.  l
ie have supported work with Luiseno m aple and
 
Yakima people , a
i
:ioruj ethers , to record their tribal alders
 
relating information about their own tradition& or collecting
 
pre-recorded information from archives of universities or the
 
government !
f
ir from museums.  I wonder if you and Mr. Black
 
would like to send us a
. narrative and budget for a project of
 
this sort
 If so, could v
ie talk about it?  You may call us

Dear Linda:
 
Here are the necessary application forms.  You probably know
 
the routine, but just to remind you -- we seed three copies
 
returned, one of which ,
should be in the origi ml typescript
 
and contain original
, signatures.  Sena back the green carp:

T
 he sooner you can possible get this back to us, the better-
,
 
maybe, since the mails are so eternally slow here, you right
 
want to send it to my horae -
-- 2300 North Fairfax, Apartment
 
401, Arlington, Virginia 22203.  Another possibility, of
 
course, would be gust to give it to me if it turns out that
 
I can make it to visit you nw t Nmek.
 
Finally, be sure to ask for enough.  Films sireAy eat a
x>ney,
 
as everybody, including our renel, knows,and,you should try
 
to yet your film nan to come up with a really realistic
 
budget Gor finishing the f
i La off in proper styles.  We would
 
rather fund fewer and better done films.
 
I
'll hope to be t
reeing you next ;

Dear Barb:
 
Thanks so much for your nice letter.
 I feel extremely honored
 
and shall retain it for historical purposes.
 
I am so pleased that the business with Christianson seems to
 
be working out so well -
-- at least, is off to such an auspicious
 
start.  You mustn't let my rambling about folk artists in
 
schools dampen your enthuslaa m I've been working hard on tIAt
 
line lately and so it's much on my mind -- however, I think
 
your notion of seeing vhat could be worked out with Christiansen
 
after the festival is excellent.  First things first.
 
Alicia is looking forward to helpirMj out also; I thiz
'
sk
. She' s
 
really ready to go home.  she's certainly been a help and
. I
 
thikk & e's learned quite a lot, but you always feel at the
 
end of something .
like this that you could/should have used the
 
time better.
 
I
 I m e
anclosing a bunch of r
aiscellan*.:uz sutff some from Alicia,
 
sometthings I found around the place after you left and didn't
 
know if you needed or not.  Also a xerox of Mitre's letter and
 
a few other odds and e
n ds.
 
I have a
. lousy drppy cold this morning, so won't carry on much
 
farther.  I had planned to go over to the Library of Congress
 
at noon today to hear the Blue Glass Cardinals (free concert
 
on the Library steps) but if this deeps up I shall gust go home.
 
Much love always,

: no aaAswer; 2 apologize .
for the
 
apparent delay in responding.
 
I am enclosing guidelines for the Jar /'olkfLthnie program in
 
our Music Division as well as for Folk Arts.  You will notice
 
that Folk Arts has no individual non-matching grants.  Folk/
 
Ethnic, however, does.
 
IV recctuaendation is that if you i
n
fould f
iant to apply to either
 
program for the National Public i
tadl
io internship, you must pa
 
provide with your application a statement from r
+PR that they
 
do in fact want you as an intern, in fact, it would be more
 
logical for them to file the application.  nave you been in
 
touch with them?  Would they be willing and would they have
 
any money to put in thes:tselves
 s if so, you might be able to
 
fund yourself entirely through NPR
, and Cooperstown and not
 
require our assistance at all.
 
Both Folk Arts and Folk/Ethnic are extrem e
ly interested in
 
t
rel ping develop radio programs, and often neglected are to
 
the panel's t
ray of thinking.  '
There is a lot wore, however,
 
to putting on a good radio program than aingily collecting
 
the material.  t
ry suggestion would be that you should start
 
working up sample scripts with recordings you k
l.ready have
 
available.  Sample programs of this type would be a more
 
convincing evidence of your expertise than unedited interviews.

ed to your letter of the 14th concerning your project

It appears the project is already in fine a

photographs?  Would it be possible for you to dive us soars descriptive
 
material such as might
 mpnay the photographs?  Also, it would be
 
helpful if we could have some infor m tion concerning those artists
 
who would be included in the photographs.
 
I am enclosing a set of application farms for you to use.  1b M
 
you return the completed forms, pla*tse incl
 vita, or ressarlat, for
 
the exhibit pre
 parator and the per ms who will be doing
 
the research . Please return the c=Tletetd forms as soon as pos-
sible, since our deadline was April 15.
 
I ass me that you will be the project director.  since you, and the
 
Center, have had a grant from us an the past, it would be most help-
ful if you could have your final report from the old grant in to us
 
before you submit a now W isest for funding. our Panel has gotten a

Have you thought of going to acme of the private corporations

Dear Raye V
Viriginia:
 
You put :
ae to shame as a letter writer.  You are indeed in-
defatigable.
 
I have spoken to Wancy and all those folks :
dio take care of
 
her schedule repeadedly about the Texas meeting, and the
 
signs appear favorable but I have yet to get a really defi-
nite answer.  Probably you will bear directly from Nancy
 
before I will,  Anyway, I
'm keeping c
an pushing.
 
As for myself, the prognosis is clearer.  we have been able
 
to shift the panel m eting dates, and I ,
a
liall be d
e3
.l.ightea
 
to *ttend the m eting.  So i
lhk
t; bit of business is settled.
 
Are you really surer you want me to chair a panel and show
 
a movie too?  Perhaps I should send a print of it down to
 
UT and let some of you folks take a look at it before it
 
gees on the printed scha f
tle.
 it's a nice quiet little
 
film about an awfully good fiddler but he is from Oklahoma
 
and I'm afraid he playa more Missouri style than Texan.
 
Anyway, I'll leave it to the program chairman's discretion,
 
but do let him/her know that r
ay feelings won't be hurt if
 
it's cut out.
 
1 spent last weekend with my b mther JUan in New York.  His
 
work is really exciting, and I
'm sure you'd enjoy netting
 
together the next tim e you area up his way, or he's down yours.
 
All the beat to you always,
