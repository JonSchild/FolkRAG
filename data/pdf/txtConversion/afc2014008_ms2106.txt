CREATIVE MARRIAGES:  TRADITIONAL ARTS APPRENTICESHIPS
 
(by Bess Lomax Hawes and Barry Bergey
 (Published in slightly
 
different  form in Celebrating Amerrica's Cultural Diversity
  
publ.by the National Assembly of Local Arts Agencies,  1010
 
Vermont Ave,  Suite  920,  Washington,D.c,  1993.)
 
The development of an artist is by no means a
 
straightforward matter of the acquisition of information and
 
the mastery of technique.  The novice must also acquire that
 
elusive component of all great art -
-
 style.Style means not
 
just what  
notes are played but how they are played,  how the
 
colors and textures  in a piece of
 stoneware relate to one
 
another,  how a singer's
 vocal chords widen or constrict,  how
 
and when a dancer's  feet step or point or tiptoe.Learning
 
style isn't easy nor,  as  some people think,  automatic;  no
 
less a master than Leonard Bernstein once observed that the
 
only way classical musicians can acquire that  final
 
burnishing essential to outstanding performances is by being
 
allowed direct association with senior artists of stature -
-
in other words,  through some kind of apprenticing,  where the
 
subtle and continuous  line of decisions artists must make can
 
be  jointly confronted.  The classical musician must  learn that
 
extra essential dimension that can't be written down on the
 
score;  they,  like other artists,  must  learn style  .And
 
nowadays not  just one  style but the several varied styles
 
expected of the well trained concert musician.
 
By contrast,  the field of folk arts encompasses not a
 
few but hundreds,  even thousands,  of directly replicated
 
styles of music, as well as dance,singing,  story telling,  pot-
throwing,  basket-weaving,  etc.  etc.  -
-
 artistic behaviors of
 
all types.  For in the traditional folk arts,  essence is
 
revealed by the particular,  and specificity is everything.
 
What  is this basket made of? What is its use?
 Which tribe
 
owns this dance? Who sings this  song?
 On what occasions?
 
Each traditional artistic item,  each traditional artistic
 
event  is the cherished production of a particular group and
 
represents  its values,  its concerns,  its actual being.  In
 
very real ways;  in the traditional arts,  the style itself
 
contains,  indeed is,  the message.
 
It then follows that the creative use of those stylistic
 
elements -
-
 the ability to improvise and stretch everyday
 
boundaries,  the pre-vision,  one might  say,  of the aesthetic
 
future -
-
 requires  study,  discipline,  and close supervision.
 
This  is what apprenticing provides.  And if the apprenticeship
 
is with an authentic master,  brought up within the
 
originating culture,  (as the Folk Arts Program emphasizes)
 
the learner also becomes part of the gradual creative process
 
of change through which all traditional art  continuously
 
evolves.

Traditional Arts Apprenticing
 
The term,  apprenticing, has a long and complex history.
 
In the general  field of the arts,  it  is  important to realize
 
that it has an informal,  rather than legal,  usage.  It has
 
nothing to do with the nationally codified and union-approved
 
training of -
-
 for example -
-
 building tradesmen like
 
plumbers,  brick-layers,  or carpenters through the general
 
stages of apprentice,  journeymen,  and master.In folk arts,
 
the terms master and apprentice represent a particular kind
 
of creative marriage,  a joining together of the experienced
 
hand and the eager learner to see to it that the tradition is
 
maintained as accurately as  can be and that the old ideas get
 
a respectful hearing.
 
This can and does happen sometimes  in a school room.  But
 
in our complex cities where shifting groups of small cultures
 
continually jostle for their place in the sun,  large scale
 
training programs  like classes and workshops tend to be
 
ineffective,  except perhaps  in an introductory capacity.  In
 
the traditional arts,  apprenticeships are ultimately much
 
more productive.  This  is why from its very beginning in 1977,
 
the NEA Folk Arts Program included a modest  funding provision
 
for the support of apprenticeships.
 
State Apprenticship Programs
 
At  first the Folk Arts
 Program funded individual
 
apprenticeships directly.  Eventually,  this approach was
 
abandoned due to the general inefficiency of administering at
 
the  federal level dozens of small,  geographically-dispersed,
 
individualized grants.  In  1984 the Folk Arts Program
 
initiated a pilot state-based apprenticeship funding category
 
intended to encourage the perpetuation of distinct folk
 
artistic traditions.
 This new program sought state partners
 
(most  frequently state arts agencies)  that were able to draw
 
on the expertise and energies of state folk arts coordinators
 
as well as locating matching moneys.
 
Twelve states participated in the initial year of this
 
pilot effort.  Some eight years later,  36 states
 conduct
 
active apprenticeship programs,  assisting apprenticeships in
 
art  forms  ranging from Ukrainian weaving to Mississippi
 
blues,  from cowboy poetry to Cambodian dance,  from Sioux
 
beadwork of the northern plains to Hispanic santo carving in
 
the Southwest.Some states have even developed spin-off
 
activities out of their apprenticeship programs,  both small
 
local presentations of the work accomplished and grander
 
projects  such as  "Colorado Folk Arts and Artists  1986-1990",
 
an important exhibit  featuring the work of Hispanic,  Native
 
American and other Coloradan master/apprentice teams to be
 
toured throughout the  state  in  1992.

The Urban Apprenticeship
 
To see how apprenticing might work in a large urban
 
area,  we might turn to the District of Columbia Commission on
 
the Arts and Humanities which set up a pilot  folk arts
 
apprenticeship program in 1989.
 The arts commission is
 
entering its fourth year of apprenticing in such arts
 
traditions as Bengali tabla  
music,  Caribbean steel drum
 
making and tuning,  the song repertoire of Guinea,  Afro-Cuban
 
drumming,  African-American quilt design and technique,  the
 
music of the  Indian sitar, and various  specialized aspects of
 
the African American religious music tradition.
 
In the District of Columbia's current program,  the
 
experienced quartet trainer and vocal coach,  Samuel Hubbard,
 
takes on a young black male contemporary vocal foursome to
 
help them refine their pitch discrimination,  rhythmic
 
precision,  and general presentation.  ("Every word is
 
pronounced,  from the first to the last," one of the
 
apprentices recently declared in respectful amazement.)
 
In another apprenticeship,  the last active  jubilee-style
 
spiritual quartet  singing group in D.C.,  The Four Echoes-- 47
 
years together -
-
 works with the younger Spiritual Kings of
 
Harmony,  a group of ex-convicts who formed their group in the
 
local minimum security prison.  Through apprenticing to the
 
Four Echoes they hope to learn more about their history and
 
cultural tradition,  as well as to widen their chances to pick
 
up engagements by acquiring the venerable vocal style that  is
 
still greatly appreciated by older D.C.  audiences.
 
Remarkably,  this apprenticeship occurs directly after
 
one with the younger singing group,  Prophecy:  Cops  for
 
Christ,  a gospel quartet of the Washington Metropolitan
 
Police officers which last year worked for many weeks with
 
the Four Echoes to increase their repertoire of traditional
 
spirituals.
 (Prophecy frequently ran through a song or two
 
in the precinct house to the applause of those waiting to be
 
charged.  "We were locking them up and giving them the Lord's
 
word at the same time," said the bass-baritone.)
 
A third apprenticeship will be conducted by Deacon
 
Solomon Bouknight,  an African American church elder who leads
 
his congregation every Sunday in the old-fashioned "lining-
out" hymn style  in which the song leader sings a line that  is
 
repeated improvisationally by all those present.  The lining-
out  style dates back to slavery and beyond;  its drawn-out
 
surging phrases are intensely emotional. Many older
 
worshippers feel that  if they don't get to sing at least one
 
such song every Sunday morning they haven't  really been to
 
church.
 
4
 
It is important to note that within the single category
 
of traditional African-American religious music,  these are
 
three absolutely distinctive stylistic inventions,  and none
 
of the three masters could substitute for the other.
 
Fitting the Program to the Culture
 
Just as single apprenticeships have historically been
 
custom-crafted to meet the needs of the master,  the
 
apprentice,  and the unique needs of the art form,  so are
 
state apprenticeship programs notable for their necessary
 
variety in structure and flexibility of design.
 These
 
jointly  (federal and state)  funded programs are of necessity
 
administered by state-based cultural specialists since they
 
require hands-on involvement with individual artists,
 
including contact with prospective applicants and evaluation
 
of ongoing pairings.
 
In most cases apprenticeships are selected through
 
formal application by a rotating panel of cultural
 
specialists,  arts administrators and artists.  However,  other
 
patterns may turn out to be culturally more appropriate;  the
 
evident popularity of this small program  (
total federal
 
budget for FY92 ---$572,999)  may in part be due to the
 
flexibility of its rules that allow a genuinely wide range of
 
variation in methodology while simultaneously maintaining
 
clear,  limited and precise goals.
 
The territories of the Pacific provide some really
 
striking case-studies of the complexities out of which a
 
working apprenticeship program can emerge.  For example,
 
American Samoa is an unincorporated territory of the United
 
States comprising six inhabited islands with a total
 
population of under 40,000,  as well as an uninhabited bird
 
sanctuary.  Four to five times more Samoans now live in Hawaii
 
and on the West Coast of the mainland than in American Samoa,
 
so the total population is around 2,000,000 with a vast
 
disproportion living outside Samoan lifeways and customs.
 
John Enright,  the Folk Arts Coordinator at the American
 
Samoa Council on the Arts,  says that,  while far from
 
vanished,  traditional craft skills have become endangered by
 
the arrival of modern commercial allurements.  "Many masters
 
today 40 and older learned their traditional crafts at a time
 
when simple metal blades and implements were the sole modern
 
refinement upon their ancestors'  methods of handiwork.  But as
 
Samoa inexorably becomes a money economy,  interest in and
 
time to devote to these traditional craft skills have all but
 
disappeared in a single generation.The tufuga  (
craftsmen)  are
 
respected but sparseley emulated."
 
In designing an apprenticeship program,  Enright realized
 
that within his  local landscape of widely dispersed villages
 
5
 
headed and administered by chiefs,  the awarding of special
 
apprenticeshp grants  could lead to inter-village antagonisms.
 
Further,  within the villages,  each extended family would
 
claim their own accomplished craftspeople,  so the selection
 
of particular master artists could well lead to perceived
 
insults to entire families.  In a society that has
 
traditionally encouraged and valued group activity,  the one-
on-one learning situation of a European-style apprenticeship
 
is not only an obvious anomaly,  it's  frequently regarded as
 
just plain weird.  And finally,  in terms of a local economy
 
that  is only partially dependent on currency,  the
 
interjection of outsider money into the cultural equation
 
could well be ultimately destructive.
 
The  start-up of the apprenticeship program proved to
 
confirm Enright's concerns.There were absolutely no responses
 
to newspaper and radio ads  in Samoan announcing the new
 
program.
 It was decided that he should speak directly with
 
leaders in the remote and dispersed villages where it became
 
necessary to follow the long and slow process of chiefly
 
deliberation,  protocol and oratory.
 Eventually even this
 
approach was abandoned because it became too politicized,  and
 
an even slower process of informal consultation and consensus
 
building emerged.
 After twelve months of apparent total
 
inactivity,  a time extension for the pilot grant was
 
requested and eventually approved.  A letter from Enright at
 
the time referred to the project as  "lurching forward" with
 
the  situation discouraging and often even enervating.
 
Finally four pilot apprenticeships were begun -
-
 two
 
involving pandanus mat weaving,  another woodcarving,  and the
 
last employing a traditional house builder.  Master carpenter
 
Togiva Vai' au worked with several apprentices at different
 
times  in the construction of a .
t
'ale tele, a traditional round
 
house,  at the International Airport at Pago Pago.  Using
 
traditional adzes,  structural timbers were decoratively
 
incised and the  structure was painstakingly bound by 130
 
miles of hand-braided coconut fiber.  In 1991 Hurricane Ofa
 
struck American Samoa,  destroying many island buildings
 
including the modern hangars and warehouses of the Pago Pago
 
airport.  The traditional fale was the only airport building
 
to survive unscathed.
 
So too the Samoan apprenticeship program has weathered
 
the ever-shifting cultural winds of this Pacific island,
 
largely due to the investment of a lot of time,  a lot of
 
cultural  sensitivity developed through lengthy discussions
 
and consultations,  and even more TLC.  Preparations are
 
currently underway for a third round of apprenticeship
 
grants.  In one of his optimistic moments,  as he struggles
 
with his budding program,  John Enright writes,  "I always take
 
refuge in the people -
 like Saunia and Mata,  my mistressful
 
pandanus plaiters of Futiga,  Manu'a,  women of strong hands
 
6
 
and peaceful eyes who always  laugh when they see me,  laugh at
 
the mutual mysteries of what  it  is we are doing.  Or my master
 
builder Vaia' u's pleasure at my first uneven strands of woven
 
sennit.  For them I
' m not a program,  just a person."
 
Newcomers an\d Old Settlers
 
In Samoa as well as Washington,  D.C.  we can see the
 
impact of the apprenticeship idea upon a long established and
 
resident  cultural population;  but  it has also proven to be
 
capable of addressing some of the needs of traditional
 
artists recently arrived in this country.  For recent
 
immigrants,
 geographic dislocation is often no less severe
 
than the cultural disorientation which occurs inevitably in a
 
new country with a different  language where there is a
 
primary need to negotiate an unfamiliar terrain of values.
 
Choices are quickly made about what to retain,  what to
 
discard,  and what to pass along to future generations.  Though
 
most cultures resonate with the concept of intensive face-to-
face transmission of artistic knowledge,  immigrant artists
 
are often confronted with a situation which pits cultural
 
preservation against the survival of health and home.
 
The Missouri Traditional Arts Apprenticeship Program has
 
supported a series of apprenticeships  involving Mone
 
Saenphimmachak,  a Lowland Lao embroiderer and weaver.  She and
 
her family moved to St.  Louis in  1984  from refugee camps in
 
Thailand,  having fled there to escape the political troubles
 
in Laos.  Mone was born in Mahazai,  a village of 500 families
 
in central Laos,  and she began to learn weaving and
 
embroidery at her mother's  side at the age of 12.  Mone says
 
of these  skills:  "No one wants to marry a girl who can't
 
sew. .Even very wealthy girls who would never have to sew as
 
adults had to know some kind of handwork in order to be
 
considered marriageable." While  she was courting with Vanxay,
 
her husband-to-be,  his mother was inspecting her weaving. As
 
part of the process of betrothal,  Mone had to present
 
Vanxay's mother with a sarong she had made.
 
Lest one think that these marital pre-conditions were a
 
bit one-sided,  Mone's  father,  at the same time,  was concerned
 
that his  future son-in-law did not know how to build a loom.
 
After their marriage,  Mone's  father instructed Vanxay in the
 
making of a loom,  commenting,  "Why did you get married if you
 
don't even know how to make a loom?"
 
Since moving to St Louis,  Mone has taught  in the
 
apprenticeship program four of the past  five years,
 
instructing a total of seven apprentices on looms Vanxay has
 
constructed for her.  This past year,  Vanxay has taught a
 
young man,  the husband of one of Mone's apprentices,  the art
 
of building a traditional Lao loom,  further echoing a cycle
 
of tradition initiated in a far-away village  in Laos.

Weaving and traditional embroidery seem to be part and
 
parcel of Mone Saephinnachak's sense of her self and her
 
bittersweet past.  She told an interviewer:  "When I teach
 
sewing I feel homesick because the patterns  I make on the
 
material remind me of the time when my mother taught me."  It
 
is  important to keep weaving,  she says,  so "we may recognize
 
ourselves by these patterns."
 
These woven and sewn patterns,  a repertoire of visual
 
melodies,  can only be passed on to a student by means of a
 
long and intimate process of demonstration and instruction.
 
Lao motifs are not graphed or charted,  they emerge on the
 
loom from the weaver's  internalized storehouse of designs.  A
 
site visitor to Mone's apprenticeship notes:  "In some ways,
 
learning each pattern is much like a fiddler working out a
 
new tune--it  is a taxing memorization process which also
 
requires physical dexterity and precision."
 
In some ways,  Art Galbraith,  a fiddler from southwest
 
Missouri,  might  seem the cultural antithesis of Mone
 
Saenphimmachak.  Six generations of Galbraiths have lived in
 
the Ozark region.  Andrew Galbraith,  Mr. Galbraith's great-
grandfather born in 1796 and a veteran of the War of 1812,
 
moved from Tennessee to the banks of Missouri's James River
 
in 1841.  A dancing master and fiddler of Scottish ancestry,
 
Andrew Galbraith passed his tunes through generations of
 
children and grandchildren until many landed in the custody
 
of Art Galbraith,  now in his early eighties.
 Mr.  Galbraith,
 
who knows hundreds of tunes,  bemoans the fact that some
 
fiddlers play for dances and seem to repeat the same tune
 
over and over all night.  He says that after twenty-five
 
repeats  "even a top-notch tune can begin to wear on you."
 
When he selected Justin Bertoldie,  a fourteen year old
 
fiddler from a musical family in a neighboring town,  Art
 
Galbraith wanted to be sure that  in addition to learning
 
technique,  Justin acquire a repertoire of these time-tested
 
tunes and that he appreciate "the history and heritage of
 
those tunes".  He also wanted to be certain that Justin be
 
conversant with the full range of tune types -
-
 hoedowns,
 
waltzes,  jigs,  reels,  rags,  blues and hornpipes.
 
One tune especially important to Mr.  Galbraith is  "The
 
Flowers of Edinburgh",  an old melody that came from his
 
great-grandfather Andrew.  He worked especially hard with
 
Justin on this tune,  because the Galbraith version is unlike
 
that performed by any other fiddler.  Gaibraith's persistence
 
was  justly rewarded.
 At a National Council on the Arts
 
meeting held in St.  Louis  in 1988,  Art and Justin performed
 
"The Flowers of Edinburgh" to demonstrate the value of the
 
apprenticeship program.  After several times through the
 
complex tune playing in unison,  Art gradually lightened his
 
touch until he  sat with his  fiddle in his  lap,  knowingly
 
smiling at the  realization that neither the audience nor the
 
8
 
young apprentice was
 aware that the mentor had stopped
 
playing.
 
Learning  About Learning
 
The Folk Arts Program has found that in contrast to
 
other activities in which endless definitions and
 
explanations are required,  the aims and conditions of an
 
apprenticeship program are everywhere almost immediately
 
understandable and acceptable.  The other striking
 
characteristic of an apprenticeship program is that it can
 
fit in just about any place,  serving the needs and interests
 
of all kinds of groups,  large and small,  urban and rural,
 
stable and mobile,  religious,  occupational,  and ethnic.  A few
 
other general observations have become evident as well during
 
the program's almost  fifteen years of testing and
 
experimentation:
 
+That the powerful human desire to extend one's own time
 
on earth is very frequently expressed by a longing to share
 
one's
 knowledge with juniors so that they can carry it
 
forward.  Young people,  too,  long for but have not everywhere
 
received frequent opportunities to earn adult attention and
 
approval.  These contradictory but positive impulses are the
 
basic energizers of any apprenticeship program and should
 
never be overlooked.
 
+That every overall apprenticeship program and every
 
individual apprenticeship within it needs to be individually
 
carved out of a base-line set of principles sufficiently
 
flexible to allow for cultural differences and sufficiently
 
rigid to encourage the production of art -
-
 art that must
 
represent,  further,  and enhance the values of the particular
 
culture in question.  (
Contrary to popular opnion,  folk art is
 
rarely widely accessible and even more rarely is it simple or
 
easy.)
 
+That genuine apprenticeships are a bit like genuine
 
marriages:  tricky to arrange and even trickier to keep going.
 
Individual creative artistic impulses must be negotiated at
 
all stages of the procedure,
 and a great deal of work
 
devolves upon the "marriage counsellor",  better known as the
 
arts administrator,  who keeps trying to bring hopeful couples
 
together and acts as both referee and consultant should any
 
difficulties occur.
 
+That it is therefore unwise to initiate an
 
apprenticeship program without having available both cultural
 
expertise and an energetic support staff.  This is a program
 
that requires hands-on administration;  there is no use to set
 
it in place without a clear understanding that extraordinary
 
efforts may be necessary to implement it.
 On the other hand,
 
extraordinary
 art may result,  and that is not an everyday
 
happening.
 
9
 
+Finally,  that apprenticeships programs seem to succeed
 
when they draw heavily on values and traditions embodied in
 
and reflective of very particular cultural landscapes.  As
 
with forests and friendships,  deeply rooted individual
 
apprenticeships tend to stand the test of time.  This
 
mysterious process succeeds  in the long run when there is a
 
timely convergence of aptitude and attitude,  grounded in a
 
sympathetic cultural terrain.  Like so many good ideas,  the
 
concept of apprenticeships came to us quite unannounced from
 
the past,  a lesson of many masters from many places.
 
And like good apprentices,  the Folk Arts Program and its
 
state arts agency partners honor this time-tested concept
 
through imitation.

ncluding
 
contact w

rospective applicants and evaluation o

I
n most cases apprenticeships a
re selected t
hrough f
ormal
 
application by a r
otating panel o
f c
ultural specialists, a
rts
 
administrators and a
rtists.  However, o

be culturally more appropriate; t

The t

f t
he Pacific p
rovide s
ome r
eally s
triking case-
s
tudies o
f t
he complexities out o
f which a working apprenticeship
 
p
rogram can emerge. For e

f t
he United S

ix
 
i
nhabited i
s
lands w

s well as
 
an uninhabited b

American Samoa, so t

otal population i
s a
round 2
,000,000 w

vast d

i
ving outside Samoan l
i
feways and c
ustoms. John
 
Enright, t
he Folk Arts Coordinator a
t t
he American Samoa Council on

t
he Arts, says t
hat, while f
ar f
rom vanished, t
raditional c
raft s
kills
 
have become endangered b
y t
he a
rrival o
f modern commercial
 
a
l
lurements.  "Many masters t
oday 40 and o
lder l
earned t

t

i

The t

(

re r
espected but sparseley emulated."
 
I
n designing an apprenticeship p
rogram, Enright r
ealized t
hat w
ithin
 
h
is l
ocal l
andscape o
f w
idely d
ispersed v
i
llages headed and
 
administered by chiefs, t
he awarding o
f s
pecial apprenticeshp
 
g
rants could l
ead t
o i
nter-village antagonisms.  Further, w
ithin t
he
 
v
i
llages, each extended f
amily would c
laim t
heir own accomplished
 
c
raftspeople, so t
he selection o
f particular master a
rtists could
 
well l
ead t
o perceived i
nsults t
o entire f
amilies.  I
n a s
ociety t
hat
 
has t
raditionally encouraged and valued g
roup activity, t
he one-on-
one l
earning s
i
tuation o
f a European-style apprenticeship i
s not only
 
an obvious anomaly, i
t i
s f
requently r
egarded as j
ust p
lain weird.
 
And f
i
nally, i
n t
erms o
f a l
ocal economy t
hat i
s only partially
 
dependent on currency, t
he i
n
terjection o
f money i
n
to t
he c
ultural
 
equation could well be u
ltimately destructive.
 
The s
tart-up o
f t
he apprenticeship p
rogram p
roved t
o confirm
 
Enright's concerns.  There were absolutely no r
esponses t
o
 
newspaper and r
adio ads i
n Samoan announcing t
he new p
rogram.
 
F
inally, i
t was decided t
hat he s
hould speak d
irectly w
ith l
eaders i
n
 
t
he r
emote and d
ispersed v
i
llages where i
t became necessary t
o
 
f
ollow t
he l
ong and s
low p
rocess o
f c
hiefly deliberation, p
rotocol
 
and o
ratory.  Eventually even t
h
is approach was abandoned because i
t
 
became t
oo politicized, and an even s
lower p
rocess o
f i
n
formal
 
c
onsultation and consensus building emerged.  A
fter twelve months
 
o
f apparent i
nactivity, a t
ime extension f
or t
he p
i
lot g
rant was
 
r
equested and eventually approved.  A l
e
tter f
rom Enright a
t t
he t
ime
 
r
eferred t
o t
he p
roject as "
lurching f
orward" w
ith t
he s
i
tuation
 
d
iscouraging and o
ften even enervating.
 
F
inally f
our p
i
lot apprenticeships were begun -
-
 two i
nvolving
 
pandanus mat weaving, another woodcarving, and t
he l
ast employing
 
a t
raditional house builder.  Master carpenter Togiva Vai'au worked
 
w

I

rom s

m

f Mone Saenphimmachak.  S

generations o

hat a

When he selected Justin Bertoldie, a f

LEARNING ABOUT LEARNING
 
The Folk Arts P

ew
 
o
ther general observations have become evident a
s well during t
he
 
p

lmost f
i
fteen years o
f t
esting and experimentation:

+That t

o t
hat t

t f
orward. Young
 
people, t
oo, l
ong f
or but have not everywhere r
eceived f
requent
 
opportunities t
o earn adult a
ttention and approval. These
 
contradictory but positive i
mpulses a
re t
he basic energizers o
f any
 
apprenticeship p
rogram and s
hould never be overlooked.
 
+That every overall apprenticeship p
rogram and every
 
i
ndividual apprenticeship w
ithin i
t needs t
o be i
ndividually carved
 
out o
f a base-line set o
f p
rinciples s
ufficiently f

-
 a

Contrary t

opnion, f
o
lk a

s r
arely w
idely accessible and even more r
arely i
s
 
i

+That genuine apprenticeships a
re a b
it l
i
ke genuine marriages:
 
t
r
icky t
o a
rrange and even t
r
ickier t
o keep going. I
ndividual c

a

mpulses must be negotiated a
t a
l
l s
tages o
f t
he p

and a g
reat deal o

he "marriage c
ounsellor",
 
better k
nown as t
he a

o b

ing
 
h
opeful couples t

s both r

s
hould any d

+That i
t i
s t
herefore u
nwise t
o i
n
itiate an apprenticeship
 
p
rogram w
ithout having available both c
ultural e
xpertise and an

So what with one t

've done a good s

f
 
t

He s

But h
