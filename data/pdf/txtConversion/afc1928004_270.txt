THE BOULEVARD. 
A POPULAR IRISH SONG. 
The Music of this song is published by E. II. H ARDING, 229 Bowckry, New 
York. 
Price 10 cents. 
As sung by Jonx ROACH. 
GOOD evening to you, one and all, 
You're looking well I 
see ; 
I 
took a 
trip in a 
great big ship 
Acrooss the raging sea; 
I've been out of work a 
month or more, 
And you know it's very hard; 
But now I've got a 
job to do 
Beyant on the Boulevard. 
CHORUS. 
Whist I 
ad id- y ! whist I 
ad-i-d-y! 
Times are very hard, 
But now I've got a 
job to do 
Beyant on the Boulevard. 
So here I 
am, an Irishman, 
And to work I'm not afraid; 
While my son does carry the pick, my boys, 
And I 
do handle the spade; 
My Uncle Dan is an Alderman, 
And he holds a 
grip in the ward ; 
'Tis him that gives the tickets out 
To work on the Boulevard. 
Whist I 
ad-i-dy! etc. 
So now farewell, l'm going away, 
I 
can no longer stay ; 
For if I 
sing any more for you 
I'll lose a 
half a 
day; 
I'm going down to the City Hall, 
To try and get a 
card 
To put my father's uncle to work 
Beyant on the Boulevard. 
Whist I 
ad-i-dy ! etc. 
THE RUNAWAY MARE.

York. 
Price 10 cents. 
W E 
started for the fair, 
With spirits light and hearty, 
Behind McCarthy's mare ; 
Oh, it was a 
lively party! 
You never saw the likes of it, 
Believe me what I 
say! 
Sure we had a 
roaring racket, 
But the mare she ran away. 
Off she wint ! off she wint ! 
Be gob, I 
%
wasn't worth a 
cint ! 
The sate was jist as hard as flint, 
Behind McCarthy's mare. 
CHORUS. 
" 
Hould her in !" McCarthy cried; 
" 
Stop her !" says McCue ; 
I 
thought I'd shake to pieces 
As along the road we flew! 
Me head was swimming like a 
top, 
My heart was in despair, 
The divil himself was in the wheels 
Behind McCarthy's mare. 
McCarthy held the reins, 
And Murphy held McCarthy, 
But whiskey filled their brains, 
And made them wild and hearty; 
Maloney tumbled out behind, 
And there we let him lay— 
Sure I 
offered to assist him, 
But the mare she ran away. 
Off s'n, wint ! off she wint ! 
Be gob. I 
wasn't worth a 
cint ! 
The sate was jist as hard as flint, 
Behind McCarthy's mare.

Hould her in !" etc.

TTTE RUNAWAY MARE.—Concluded. 
Me dacent coat was tore, 
Me hat was left behind me; 
I 
rattled and I 
swore, 
And I 
thought the dust would blind me; 
In holes and ditches wint the wheels-
0, murther! such a 
day! 
Sure mesilf was kilt intirely, 
With the mare that run away. 
Off she wint ! off she wint! 
Be gob, I 
wasn't worth a 
cint! 
The sate was jist as bard as flint, 
Behind McCarthy's mare. 
" 
Hould her in!" etc. 
I SHALL NEVER SEE THE SUMMER FLOW'RS 
AGAIN. 
Words by ROBERT MCKAY. 
Music by J. SCHWENSECK. 
The Music of this song is published by E. H. HARDING, 229 Bowery, New 
York. Price 10 cents. 
Su how fast from heaven, mother, 
Fall the feath'ry flakes of snow, 
Weaving white and pure a 
mantle 
For the fruitful earth below ; 
Ere they melt I'll leave you, mother, 
Leave for e'er this world of pain; 
Something tells me I 
shall never 
See the summer fiow'rs again. 
CLIORUS. 
Do not weep, dear loving mother, 
Sad am I 
to cause you pain; 
But something tells me I 
shall never 
See the summer flow'rs again. 
How I 
lov'd alone to wander 
In the happy days long flown, 
O'er field and meadow fair, to gather 
Bright-hued blossoms freshly blown ; 
Soon beside the ripplincr river, 
Winding onward o'er the plain. 
The buds will burst, but I 
shall never 
See the summer flOw'rs again. 
Do not weep, etc.

GOOD-BYE, BIDDY DEAR. 
[Copyright, 1875, by ROBERT M. 
DEWITT.] 
A SKETCH FOR TWO CHARACTERS. 
[Scene, a 
cabin with an open window. 
Enter TEDDY, with a 
bundle slung over his shoulder.] 
TEDDY.—I've had a 
bard time of it here in ould Erin, and 
although I've tried to keep up my spirits for the sake of my 
dear colleen, I've at last been forced to go over the sea. 
It's 
hard, hard times in the ould land, and I 
must be off to the 
new. 
But do you think that I 
ever can forget you, Erin dar-
ling? 
Bad luck to the Irishman that ever did! 
One more 
sweet kiss from the girl I 
love, and then for the big ship. 
This is Biddy's cabin. 
She must be up. 
I'll knock. [Knocks 
at cabin door.] 
Biddy acushla! 
• 
[BIDDY at the open window.] 
BIDDY. —Is that you, Teddy ? 
TEDDY.—Yes, darlint, and I'm going away; so I 
thought I'd 
come and say good-bye. 
BIDDY.—Going away so soon? 
TEDDY.—Yes, darlint; but it won't be for long. 
I'll soon 
clasp you to my heart again, and we shall be as happy as the 
starling. 
BIDDY.—But you'll forget me, Teddy; they say there's pret-
tier faces over there than you'll find at home, to steal away 
your heart. 
TEDDY.—Is it prettier faces there than here ? 
Why, beau-
tiful girls in ould Ireland are as plentiful as the daisies; and 
you are the queen of them all. 
I 
could never forget you, 
Biddy; don't speak like that. 
Sure among ten thousand lovely 
girls I 
couldn't see one but you. 
[Music plays the symphony of the song. BIDDY and TEDDY 
clasp hands at the window.] 
TEDDY sings. 
Then here I 
am an Irishman, 
I'm always fond of mirth ; 
But show me the creature 
Would slight me for my birth. 
( 
1 ) 
GOOD-BYE, BIDDY DEAR.—[ComaNuEnj 
And here's my sweet colleen 
I'm forced to leave behind ; 
I 
always was the broth of a 
boy, 
And my true love she is kind. 
CHORUS—BIDDY and TEDDY. 
Bidd 
0! 0! 0! good-bye, 
ddyy 
dear; 
Te 
'Tis hard to part from you; 
Although we're going to sever, 
My- heart it will prove true. 
Thin cheer up, mavourneen, 
And don't look so forlorn, 
We soon will meet again, love, 
When these gloomy days are gone. 
TEDDY.—I 
wouldn't leave ould Irc'and, 
But times are bad, yon know; 
So to the land of plenty, 
My darlint, I 
must go. 
I 
bundled up my kit, 
Oh, Biddy, don't you cry ; 
The vessel soon will bear me on 
With many a 
weary sigh. 
CHORUS—BIDDY and TEDDY. 
[Same as before.] 
TEDDY.—When I 
arrive, my darlint, 
There'll be joy within my soul, 
I'll work and save my money, 
And send you, love, the whole. 
The maidens may be fair; 
But, Biddy, never fear— 
The last words that you say will still 
Be ringing in my ears. 
CHORUS—BIDDY and TEDDY. 
[Same as before.]

GOOD -BYE , BIDDY DEAR.—[CONTINuED1 
TEDDY.—Now I 
must say good-bye to you, 
I 
can no longer stay; 
The ship will soon be sailing 
Far out from Dublin Bay. 
But, Biddy, soon expect me, 
We'll marry by-and-bye; 
Oh, when you are for ever mine, 
No more I'll weep and sigh. 
CHORUS—BIDDY and TEDDY. 
[Same as before.] 
[They embrace, and TEDDY departs, leaving BIDDY looking 
sorrowfully aft:r hin2,.]

ONE day while walkino down Broadway 
I 
met my cousin Joe, 
lie asked me then if I 
with him 
To Central Park would go; 
With my consent we then did start, 
And reached the lake at three, 
We took a 
sail, and words of love 
Were pass'd by Joe and me. 
CHORUS. 
Sailing on the lake, 
To the music of the birds, 
The rippling of the waters, 
And the sound of loving words. (Repeat.) 
On our return we took a 
stroll, 
And soon did reach the mall, 
When from the distance music sweet 
Upon our ears did fall ; 
We sat and listened to the band 
Beneath a 
hawthorn tree, 
While " en 
tle breezes carried words 
Of love from Joe to me. 
Sailing on the lake, etc. 
Now Joe has asked me to be his, 
0;. course I 
won't refuse, 
And pa has given his cohsent— 
This chance I 
must not lose ; 
And when some day at Central Park 
lake you go to see, 
kaow you'll whi ,per words of love, 
Like my dear Joe and me.

I 
hear their sweet voices on high, 
They call roe to join little Bertha 
Who dwells far above the blue sky ; 
I 
know they will treat me with kindness, 
For look, they are smiling at me, 
Their arms are around one another, 
Come, mother, be quick and you'll see. 
Hark, mother, dear mother, they call me, 
Come nearer and look to the sky, 
They call me to join little Bertha, 
So, mother, your darling must die. 
The angels are calling me, mother, 
Just look at the heavens above, 
The gates they are open, and Bertha 
Is joining in praises of love ; 
Oh see, she is beckoning to me 
To come and abide with her there, 
Oh, mother, she's smiline so sweetly, 
And looking so charming and fair. 
Hark, mother, etc. 
The angels are calling me, mother, 
Oh, listen and hear what they say, 
They tell me to haste to that Eden 
And not for a 
moment delay; 
So, mother, good bye, kiss your darling, 
For Bertha so charmingly sings 
That I 
must away then to join her, 
An angel with bright golden winos.

My name is Roger O'Malley, understand, 
And don't begin for to doubt me ; 
I 
own my own house, and a 
bit o' land, 
There's DO common stock about me. 
I 
went to college when a 
boy, 
And left with heaps of lore ; 
And came out here to this free land, 
Just pravious to the war. 
CHORUS. 
Roger O'Malley, that's my name, 
Quite famous I 
have grown ; 
I'm far superior to Muldoon, 
Mulcahy, or Malone. 
I'm quite independent in my way, 
High-ton'd and well educated ; 
All my taxes Pm ready for to pay, 
And I'm not in the least dissipated. 
I 
can take a 
drink, and smoke a 
cigar, 
With comfort and delight ; 
But you'll never see me loafin' round 
The whiskey bars at night 
Roger O'Malley, etc. 
I'm as dacent a 
man as you can find, 
Like all my seven generations ; 
With a 
good deal of larnin' in my mind, 
Which I 
use on important occasions ; 
I'm far above yer common scraps, 
That fling their names all round. 
And they'll not catch me in any traps, 
For I'm sensible and sound. 
Roger O'Malley, etc. 
I'm a 
marshal whenever we patade, 
I 
ride a 
horse from Arabs-
With a 
big stick of honor in my hand, 
Sure, in martial affairs I'm no baby. 
I 
ate my fill, and wear good clothes, 
Made up in the style you see ; 
My walk is grand, and plainly shows 
That there's no such man as me

POPPING CORN . 
AND there they sat a-popping corn, John Stiles and Susan Cut-

And talked of different kind, of ears, and bitched their chairs up

Then Susan she the hopper shook, then John he shook tha pop-

Till both their faces grew as red as saucepans made of copper, 
And then they shelled, and popped, and ate, all kinds of fun a-

And be haw-hawed at her remarks, and she laughed at his jok-

And still they popped and still they ate, John's mouth was like

And stirred the fire, and sprinkled salt, and shook and shook

kept popping; 
It struck eleven, then struck twelve, and still no signs of stop-

And John he ate, and Susan thought, the corn did pop and pat-

Coy and demure, 
That I 
thought her complaint 
Only marriage would cure ; 
So I 
asked, " If she wed," 
Did she think she would die? 
She pretended to faint, 
But her only reply -was — 
Cho. — Oh, my 1

5. Now I 
found out this bashful 
And timid young lamb 
Was simply a

Her kisses were free ; 
Perhaps she had one of them, 
But she didn't "have me," (with her)

41y bark of life was tossing down the troubled stream of time, 
When first I

Misfortune nursed me as her child, and fondly loved me too, 
I 
would have had a 
broken heart, had it not been for you ; 
Kind words were whispered soft and sweet, but glad I 
could not 
be, 
Until I 
found that yort had been a 
faithful friend to rite.

The light of hope from your bright eyes dispelled the clouds 
of strife, 
And threw their rays of sunshine down my weary path of life :

I 
smile to think ' mid all life's scenes, you've been a 
friend to me.

Can dance an Irish jig.

IT'S many years ago in Ireland, you must know, 
Since happiness looked down on our land, 
Our sons they then were free, and the star of liberty 
Shone gloriously on every Irishman. 
But let us bar the door on the days that are no more, 
There's a 
light a 
beaming on us from afar, 
If you listen unto me I 
will tell you, do you see, 
The sentiments of Pat of Mullingar.

Hurrah for Erin's Isle, though her sons you can beguile, 
Because they know the wolf is at the door, 
Yet may our flag be seen aloft in College Green, 
And a 
Home Rule in Ireland evermore. 
In England they may boast that our Parliament is lost, 
And say that we never should complain; 
Would you have my heart be light when I 
know for this very 
right 
My countrymen are wishing o'er the main'? 
Gladstone he may rave, but our country for to save, 
These words they should be heard from shore to shore, 
For O'Connell he did say, before he passed away, 
A Home Rule for Ireland for evermore. 
Hurrah for, etc. 
There's one now in his grave who struggled hard to save 
Our country from oppression long ago, 
Henry Grattan is his name, and may heaven be his gain, 
his energy on Ireland did bestow. 
His voice lie never gave our people to enslave, 
Nor drive them to a 
far and distant shore, 
May the flowerlets ever wave upon our hero's grave, 
And a 
Home Rule in Ireland for evermore. 
Hurrah for, etc. 
There's a 
laurel for the brow of the one who's striving now 
To win our Legislature back again, 
John Martin, ever bold our misery to unfold, 
And Ireland for the Irish will maintain. 
But let us all unite to drink this toast to-night, 
May happiness revisit Erin's shore, 
And the plan of Isaac Butts, from the palace to the huts, 
Be a 
Home Rule for Ireland for evermore.

OR, THE ROLLICKING IRISHMAN. 
Sung by JOHNNY ROACH. 
So, boys, I'm here once more you see, and a 
story I'm going to 
tell; 
It's something new between, me and you, which an Irishman 
befell ; 
'Twas in the town of Liverpool, in a 
street I 
forget the name, 
But to pass the time in the chorus join, just while I 
sing the 
same. 
CHORUS. 
His name was Pat—just think of that! anel beat it if you can ; 
There's none so gay, both night and day, as a 
rollicking Irish-
man; 
Whack, whack, whack, burro°, tiddy I 
dow do dow, 
Whack, whack, whack, burro°, tiddy I 
dow de dow ; 
Oh, at a 
wake or a 
fair we're always there, the Tipperary men. 
Now the weather was cold, and this hero bold about for work 
did seek ; 
He got a 
job to carry bricks at eighteen shillincrs .a,week ; 
He bought a 
hod for half a 
crown from a 
man named Mickey 
Burke, 
And Pat so gay the very next day at six o'clock went to work. 
His name was Pat, etc. 
They were building a 
house—'twas very high, but Pat didn't 
care a 
jot; 
To his work got drilled, when his hod was filled, bow quick up 
the ladder he'd trot ; 
He was going to the top about twelve o'clock, but whether ' twas 
frost or the rum, 
This hero bold he missed his hold, and down be came by the 
run. 
his name was Pat, etc. 
Now, as Pat down did go, he put his hand so, and then a 
loud 
veil he gave; 
He cried, " Och hone!" as down he came ; " may the Lord my 
poor soul save !" 
He turned o'er and o'er when be reached the first floor, on his 
feet he then tried to jump, 
But his bead first came down, and when near the ground he 
cried, 
Now for a 
thundering bump !" 
His name was Pat, etc.

But none will care from whence he came,

SAD was the day, Erin, I 
bade thee good-bye, 
I

Thy hills of pure em'rald, the pastures and plain 
Are sights, darling country, I'll ne'er see again ; 
A

heart that was sore, 
Was mine when I 
left thee to see thee no more ; 
But visions of all that I 
left there behind 
Are flitting so sweetly at times thro' my mind.

bade thee good-bye, 
And sad were my feelings when Norah did cry ; 
I 
left her, sweet jewel, a- waving her hand, 
As the ship shot away from my dear native land. 
She stood on the cliffs till the dark of the night 
Had shut the fast- sailing craft out of her sight; 
Then to her small cabin she went, well I 
know, 
And wept did my darling, because I 
would go. 
Sad was the day, etc. 
Sad was the day, Erin, I 
bade thee good-bye, 
But hard I 
will work, and much harder will try 
To bring the dear creature, the sweet little dove, 
My Norah, to this, now the land that I 
love ; 
The Irishman finds here a 
friend that is true, 
The Green waves aside of the Red, White, and Blue ; 
And all from the Emerald Isle of the sea 
Find welcome in this, the real home of the free.

WHEN THE AUTUMN LEAVES ARE 
FALLIN G. 
W ords by 3. E. CARPENTER, ESQ. 
Music by J. W. CumulT. 
W HEN the autumn leaves are falling, 
And the flowers have lost their prime, 
And the bird to his mate is calling 
To soar to a 
brighter clime, 
The heart that is bow'd by sorrow 
Now sinks in a 
deeper gloom; 
For we know that the coming morrow 
Must wither some lingering bloom. 
For we know that the coming morrow 
Must wither some lingering bloom. 
When the shadows of ev'ning lengthen, 
And we muse o'er each present grief, 
The hopes.that we strive to strengthen, 
We feel, like our joys, are brief ; 
And the leaves, as they fall around us, 
Remind us how short our span ; 
That the flow'rs which the springtime found us 
But fade like the hopes of man. 
That the flow'rs which the springtime found us 
But fade like the hopes of man. 
MY IRISH HOME; 
OR, " DEAR ISLE OF THE SHAMROCK." 
Words by T. C. S. CORRY, M . 
D. 
Music by W ALTER BURNS. 
D EAF: isle of the shamrock, where I 
lov'd to wander, 
And pluck hawthorn blossoms when hope's dream was young, 
Thonoh far, far away, my heart daily grows fonder 
Of thy plaintive lays which so oft I've heard snip,. 
Green, green be thy 'fields; happy home of my childhood; 
Thy danediters are pure and thy sons brave and free ; 
Fair land of the mountain, lake, round tow'r, and wild wood, 
Tho' now I'm an exile, my heart clings to thee. 
At morn when the sun thro' night's darkness is gleaming, 
And darting his rays from the east o'er the sea,. 
Each stream of pure light that so brightly is beaming 
Seems ‘vaftinE,v a 
inessaae from Erin to me. 
Yet this western world with abundance is flowina, 
There's food for the poor and the weary find rest; 
But tho' nature's gifts all around me are growing, 
My old Irish home is the spot I 
love best.

SIXTY NINTH." 
Words by ED. HARRIGAN. 
Music by DAVE BRAHAM. 
The Music of this song is published by Wm. A. POND is Co, 547 Broad-
way, New York City. 
Price 40 cents. 
W E are privates in the Sixty-Ninth, 
We follow up the fife and the drum; 
We can't forget our old comrades, 
And their glory at Bull Run. 
It vs as there with bayonets bristling, 
In the thickest of the fray, 
Where the shot and shell were wh'stling, 
Our boys help'd gain the day. 
CHORUS. 
We march behind the band, 
True sons of Paddy's land, 
The Irish boys for style are excellent; 
The green above the red, 
With martial step we tread, 
In the gallant Sixty- Ninth Regime., 
They admit we are the ladies' pride, 
When we're out for a 
grand review, 
They shout huzza from near and far, 
At our Irish boys so true; 
With columns solid as a 
wall, 
Bright uniforms neat and clean, 
We are one and all sons of Erin, 
From the land of the Shamrock green. 
We march, etc. 
Should America call on her soldier boys, 
To the front we'd boldly go; 
For a 
rialueous cause, our Nation's laws, 
Give battle to the foe, 
Well ne'er for;:et old Ireland, 
But keep our powder dry, 
"Fauah a 
ballaah " our cry, clear the way, 
To conquer or to die. 
We march, etc.

IT 
was on a 
Saturday night 
That we started a 
Company, 
And elected Anthony Wright, 
Our Captain for to be ; 
He accepted office with thanks, 
And appointed us Pioneers 
For to march in front of the ranks, 
In the Hoolahan Musketeers! 
CHOTZUS. 
We march'd like soldiers thro' the streets, 
With our new flags flyina so gay, 
And bate the time wid both our feet, 
While the band did sweetly play ; 
From win lows high the girls did look, 
And they smil'd at the Pioneers, 
And then their handkerchiefs they shook, 
At the Hoolahan Musketeers. 
To the guests invited we Dave 
All the prizes to carry round, 
And at nine o'clock we did lave, 
For to go to the shooting around, 
Where we stopp'd for two hours or more, 
And we toasted the Pioneers, 
Had eating and drinking galore, 
Did the Hoolahau Musketeers! 
We march'd, etc. 
But when we got back to the ward, 
It was then we felt light and gay, 
And our Captain flourish'd his sword, 
While the crowd did lave the way; 
At Monahan's we broke up then, 
And faith, we gave three hearty cheers 
For the officers and the men, 
In the Hoolahan Musketeers! 
We march'd, etc.

THE hero of my humble song 
Was once a 
mighty man, 
A 
shining light in his neighborhood, 
And chief of all his clan; 
But when he found in course of time 
The tricks his friends did play, 
Sure he left them all, and now they

cry, 
lie was great and grand, and took command 
Of the boys on Patrick's day; 
But now the cry is everywhere, 
Mulcahy's gone away. 
He won our pride and won our praise, 
And he deserved it too! 
Sure many a 
time for nights and days 
We stuck to him like glue; 
He held an office of the State, 
And faith he made it pay; 
But for such a 
place he was too great, 
And now he's gone away! 
He was great, etc. 
The politicians worshipped him, 
And swore he'd yet be Mayor; 
And tho' the chance looked rather dim, 
He thought it bright and fair;

MULCAHY'S GONE AWAY. —Continuec2 
But ere he came to rule the town, 
His mind was led astray, 
And now the cry is everywhere, 
Mulcahy's gone away! 
He was great, etc. 
He was as sound a 
Democrat 
As ever filled a 
chair, 
But he lost his great position, 
And it drove him to despair; 
We know not where to seek for him; 
He must have crossed the say; 
0, it grieves us just to think of it— 
Mulcaby's gone away! 
He was great, etc. 
He trenied us like gintlemen 
Whenever we did meet; 
The sight of him would do you good, 
From his head down to his feet; 
He wore a 
collar stiff and high, 
Which made a 
great display; 
He was a 
most distinguished man— 
But now he's gone away! 
He was great, etc. 
The girls went crazy when he winked, 
And many an artful plan 
They put in operation for 
To catch this darlin' man; 
But now they're left alone, poor things; 
They weep and wail, and say— 
Oh. what'll we do at all, at all 1 
Mulcahy's gone away!

HAT ME FATHER WORE. 
Composed by DANIEL McCenrr, and given by him to JOEINNT RoAcn, as 
a 
token of respect. 
AIR.—" Irish Molly, 01" 
Pin Paddy Miles, an Irish boy, just come across the sea; 
For singing or for dancing, boys, I 
think that I'll please ye; 
I 
can sing and dance with any man, as I 
did in days of yore, 
And on Patrick's day I 
love to wear the hat me father wore. 
CHORUS. 
It's old, but it's beautiful—the best you ever seen; 
'Twas worn for more than ninety years in that little Isle so green. 
From my father's great ancestors it descended with gallore— 
It's a 
relic of old decency, is the hat me father wore. 
I 
bid you all good evening—good luck to you, I 
say, 
And when I 
cross the ocean I 
hope for me you'll pray; 
I'm going to my happy land in a 
place called Ballymore, 
To be welcomed back to Paddy's land with the hat me father 
wore. 
It's old, etc. 
And when I 
do return again the boys and girls to see, 
I 
hope that with old Erin's style you'll kindly welcome me, 
With the songs of dear old Ireland to cheer me more and more, 
And make me Irish heart feel glad with the hat me father wore. 
It's old, etc.

M ESELP and Barney Casey whit to have a 
little spree, 
He had a 
bottle for himself, and another one for me; 
We thravell'd round the city till our heads and feet were sore 
And evtry dbrink it was so nice, it made us wish for more. 
CHORUS. 
Bad luck to Casey's whiskey, it made us both so frisky, 
We dlirank our bottles empty, and at last we couldn't stand; 
Along the streets we rambled, we staggered and we scrambled, 
And sang a 
song, the whole night long, of gay ould Paddy's 
land. 
We met a 
big policeman, and be looked at us, says he, 
" 
What brings you out so late as this ?" says I, " the counthry 
free ;" 
" 
Shut up," says Casey, " come along!" " 0, divil a 
bit," says 
" 
I'll sthrike him if he says a 
word, We durty mane ould spy.' 
SPOKEN — And if I 
ever did sthrike him he might well say 
Bad luck to, etc. 
He turned around and left us—sure the man was not to blame 
I 
called him back, and axed him if he'd phase to tell his name 
" 
Of coorse," says he, " it's Flanigan, I'm front the count 
Clare." 
Hurroo l" says I, " shake hands, me bty, our whiskey you mus 
share 1

Bad luck to, etc. 
Out kern the empty bottle, and I 
put it in his paw, 
" 
Look out," say he, " whin on me post, a 
dhrink's against the 
law." 
He put the bottle to his mouth, but divil a 
clhrop was there, 
And while we laughed at Flanigan, sure he began to swear! 
Bad luck to, etc. 
He raised his club above his bead, and vowtd he'd take us in 
For dhrinking on the highway, " 0," says Casey, " that's too 
thin!" 
He dhragged poor Casey off to jail, and thried to take me too, 
But to keep a 
hoult on Casey was as much as he could do. 
SPOKEN.— I 
pitied poor Casey and I 
suppose he pitied me. 
But it was all his own doings. 
The two bottles fixed him. 
Bad luck to, etc.

THEET 
As 
Sung by Gus W ILLIAMS. 
Just like Sinbad the Sailor, 
Or Rooinson Crusoe— 
left my native land, in search, 
of wonders 1 
would go: 
I 
went to be a 
sailor— 
I 
come back, as you see, 
A 
iii : aturo of an Indian, 
A Turk and Chimpanzee. 
CHORUS: Jamsetjhee, ins jabajebm 
Tabhery Dobie Porie 
Ikey, Pikey, Sikey, Crikey, 
Chillingowullahadorie. 
We'd been to sea a 
fortnight, 
A dreadful storm arose: 
Upon an Island I 
was thrown, 
To wind and rain exposed, 
By savages surround,d 
at was their Island home) 
They addressed me in a 
langnage, 
Decidedly their own. 
Jamsetjhee, ma jabajehoy, &e, 
I 
expected from these savages, 
Less pence titan kicks and blows: 
They'd a 
funny dress, in fact they'd no 
A single stitch of clothes. 
They tore my things from off my back, 
My hair from out the roots, 
They left me with a 
waistcoat, 
A bat and pair of hoots. 
Jamsetjhee ma jabajeboy, 
When they'd got alt my clothing, 
Thinks I: what next they'll do/ 
They brought their paint and painted we, 
With colors red and blue— 
And so that was my costume: 
A waiscoat for my clothes, 
Striped red and blue, a 
hat and boots, 
And a 
ring stuck through my nose 
Tamsetjhee, majabajehoy, &a. 
Vor five years in that costume, 
I 
roamed about the land: 
To a 
damsel of the Royal-blood 
They made me give my hand: 
And there were great rejoicings, 
Upon the wedding day, 
And we've got two pairs of black kids, 
My wife has taught to say: 
Jamsetjhee, ma jabajehoy, è. 
One day, a 
ship app eared in sight, 
I'd scarce believe it true— 
To reach the ship I 
stole a 
boat, 
And paddled my own canoe. 
But now I'm back in Merrikey, 
The country I 
adore— 
I'll take good care to stick to It— 
And never leave it more. 
Jamesetjhee, majabajohoy AmS,

I 
KEEP a 
saloon on the corner, my boys, 
And faith I've a 
flourishing trade ; 
I've brought out my cousin, Nathaniel Doyle, 
The money on whiskey I 
made. 
I 
could sell to you now a 
nice " Pusse Caffay," 
Or a " Rhino Victoria " cigar ; 
No slate, chalk, or pencil, is kept in the house 
When Malone's at the back of the bar. 
Tra la la, tra la la! 
When Malone's at the back of the bar. 
I 
never was stood up for brandy or beer. 
My rule is to never give " tick ," 
When a 
bunt's at the store on a 
cold winter's morn, 
It's meself that is making a " kick." 
I 
set out a 
lunch on the table so neat, 
Fat herrings, presarved in a 
jar ; 
I'd cut off the hand of a 
snoozer, or vag, 
That grabs when I'm back of the bar. 
Tra la la, etc. 
The till I 
keep here in my pocket so safe, 
I 
light up my kerosene lamps ; 
At daylight I

YOIJNG FELLAI1, YOU'RE TOO FRESH. 
SERIO-COMIC SONG. 
Written and composed by JOSEPH E. SKELLY. 
Entered according to Act of Congress, in the year 1874, by E. H. HARDING, 
in the Office of the Librarian of Congress, at Washington, D. C. 
The Music of this song is published by E. H. HARMING, 288 Bowery, New

BECAUSE I 
am a countryman, 
And a 
stranger in the city, 
All sorts of tricks they play on me, 
And they think their actions witty; 
When I 
go out I 
turn about, 
And peculiar smiles I 
see; 
" 
Oh, ain't he fresh 7" I 
hear them shout, 
While they take long looks at me. 
SPOKEN.—I 
can't understand it at all. 
No matter where I 
go, 
I 
hear some personal remarks. 
I 
don't like personal remarks. 
They strike deep into my sensitive breast, and make me swear. 
say, " Dew it, what does it mean 7" and echo answers, " Dem 
what does it mean'?" 
The very day I 
arrived in this city I 
a • keil a 
man up at the Grand Central Depot if he knew where I 
von:d engage a 
nice furnished room. " Oh," says he. " you're 
fter furnished rooms, eh ? 
Well, sir, you're in the wrong 
n-syi.hborhood; you don't belong here. 
Well, sir, I suppose 
you'll keep correct by following your nose !" 
I 
told him he 
was very impertinent. But as I 
walked away in silence and dis-
may, I 
heard the fellow say in a 
very peculiar way— 
CHORUS. 
Young fellah, you're too fresh, 
Young fella"), you're too fresh; 
It strikes me very forcibly, 
Young fellow, you're too fresh. 
One day last week I 
took a 
car, 
And a 
stranger sat beside me, 
Who stole my watch and pocketbook, 
Though to prove it he defied me; 
I 
went and saw a 
man of law, 
And berrued his best advice ; 
" 
My friend," said he, " .vou're very fresh ; 
Why, you've just come off the ice." 
(1) 
I.) 
YOUNG FELLAH, 
YOU'RE TOO FRESH. 
Continued. 
SPOKEN.—I 
thought that a 
very strange expression for a 
man 
of law. 
I 
told him he must certainly be mistaken, for I 
had 
never been on ice in my life. " Oh, yes, you have," says he, 
" 
metaphorically speaking, you have, sir; you have been on the 
ice of innocence; you have lived in an atmosphere of Arctic 
virtue, free from the burning influence of metropolitan wicked-
ness." 
He wanted to convince me that I 
was an ice man, I 
sup-
pose. 
But as he could give me no satisfaction for the loss I 
sustained, I 
left him; and as I 
came down stairs I 
heard him 
say— 
Young fellah, etc. 
I 
took my girl to Central Park, 
And while there I 
grew quite spoony; 
I 
asked her if she'd marry me; 
" 
Why," says she, " you must be loony ;" 
I 
told her no, it is not so, 
I 
assure you, I'm quite sane; 
You know I 
love you very much— 
Oh, don't let me love in vain. 
SPOKEN.—She didn't seem to understand my feelings correct-
ly, although I 
poured out my love in strains worthy of a 
trou-
badour. 
All she would say was, " Oh, don't! please don't! I 
want to go home! please don't!" 
" 
Nay, home thou shalt not go 
Till reasons good I 
know 
Why thou wilt not bestow 
Thy love on me, 
And fill with glee 
This breast now shadowed o'er by woe. 
By jingo! yes, the cause I'll know I 
Speak out! Oh, fairest creature speak! 
Tell me what secret hate thou hast! 
The tale I 
hear may make me weak, 
And all my hopes and fancies blast, 
But I 
must know! yes, I 
must know, 
Wherefore thou slightest me." 
I 
began to get excited, so she thought she had better explain 
herself. 
You may judge of my astonishment when she remark-
ed— 
Young fellah, etc.

PADDY CAREY. 
'Tams at the town of nate Clogbeen, 
That Sergeant Snapp met Paddy Carey; 
A 
clatter boy was never seen. 
Brisk as a 
bee, light as a 
fairy; 
His brawny shoulders, four feet square, 
His cheeks like thumping red potatoes, 
His legs would make a 
chairman stare I 
And Pat was loved by all the ladies, 
Old and young, grave and sad, 
Deaf and dumb, dull or mad, 
Waddling, twaddlng, limping, squinting, 
4 
Light, brisk and airy— 
cuonus. 
All the sweet faces at Limerick races, 
From Nullinavelt to Magherafelt, 
At Paddy's beautiful name would melt 
The sowls would cry, and look so shy, 
Och! Cushlamachree, did you never see 
The jolly boy, the darling joy, the ladies toy, 
Nimble- footed, black-eyed, rosy-eheeked, 
Curly-headed Paddy Carey! 
0, sweet Paddy, beautiful Paddy! 
Nate little, tight little Paddy Carey. 
His heart was made of Irish oak, 
Yet, soft as streams from sweet Killarney, 
His tongue was tipped with a 
bit of the brogue, 
But the deuce a 
bit at all of the blarney. 
Now Sergeant Snapp, so sly and keen; 
While Pat was coaxing duck-legged Mary, 
A 
shilling slipped, so nate and cane, 
By the powers, he 'listed Paddy Carey! 
Tight and sound—strong and light— 
Cheek so round—eyes so bright— 
Whistling, humming, d:inking, drumming, 
Light, tight and airy— 
All the sweet faces, &x.

The Bowls wept loud, the crowd was great, 
When waddling forth came widow Leary; 
Though she N% as crippled in her gait, 
Her brawny arms clasped Paddy Carey! 
" 
Och I 
Pat," she cried, " go buy the ring; 
Here's cash, galore, my darling honey." 
Says Pat, " You sowl I'll do that thing." 
And clapped his thumb upon her money. 
Gimlet eye—sausage nose— 
Pat so sly—ogle throws—

Sweet widow Leary! 
All the sweet faces, &A 
When Pat had thus his fortune made, 
He pressed the lips of Mistress Le . ry, 
And mounting straight a

In captain's boots struts Paddy Carey;

To others like a 
dromedary; 
Her eyes, that seemed their strings to crack, 
Were Cupid's darts to Captain Carey!

Yet thou did'st pale, silent and pained, 
And thou did'st moan ; sad, sad to be 
Utterly lone by the bleak sea!

YOU AND I. 
Music and words by CLAnnsEL. 
We sat by the river, you and I, 
In the sweet summer time, long ago, 
So smoothly the water glided by, 
Making music in its tranquil !low ; 
We threw two leaflets, you and I, 
To the river as it wandered on, 
And one Wai rent and left to die, 
And the other floated forward all ale.nte. 
And oh ! we were sadden'd, you and I, 
For we felt that our youth's golden dream 
Might fade, and our lives be sever'd soon, 
As the two leaves were parted in the stream. 
'Tis years since we parted, you and I, 
In that sweet summer time, long ago, 
And I 
smile as I 
pass the river by, 
And I 
gaze into the shadow depths below. 
I 
look on the grass and bending reeds, 
And I 
listen to the soothing song, 
And I 
envy the calm and happy life, 
Of the river as it sings and flows along, 
for—oh ! how its song brings back to me, 
The shade of our youth's gollen dret

She'll sing and she'll dance to the old mill clack, 
And the song that she sings, " Will my love come back ?"

Laughs alou-I till the tears down his checks run clear; 
And the lads in the village they know right well, 
What a

How my heart goes bump when I

That we both first met in the new-mown hay, 
She looked like a

delicate blush, 
Or a 
sweet water lily all among the rush. 
I 
sighed, " Pretty Polly, what a

THE LESS I SAY OF IT,

Ant.—" It's wonderful bow we do it, but we do." 
New songs will come around, 
As new subjects they abound, 
And the one I've got, I 
think is just the cheese, too, 
And if it makes a 
hit, 
Why then, I 
don't care a 
bit, 
For my object is for to sing and to please you. 
It's a 
saying, by the way, 
That you hear every day, 
And sometimes you may read it in a 
letter; 
So with no more preface, 
I 
will introduce my case— 
For, I 
think the less I 
say of it, the better. 
A 
young man in the street, 
A 
pretty girl does meet, 
And introduces himself by sweet talking 
She thinks lie is so nice, 
For he talks as smooth as ice 
To her, as along the street they're walking ; 
And not long after that, 
She's got on a 
new hat, 
And way up town we find that he has net her ; 
And when it does get dark, 
They walk into the park— 
Well, I 
think the less I 
say of it the better. 
I've been idle just a 
year, 
And I'm feeling mther queer, 
; 
As to where I'm going for to raise some 
money 
For it's true, upon my life, 
l've got a 
darling wife, 
And she can't live very long cm love and honey; 
But there's one thing so fine, 
We've no children so divine, 
So poverty it don't seem such a 
fetter. 
But on this you may rely, 
There will come some by- and-bye—

MY 
love is the belle of the Avenue, 
She walks up and down ev'ry day, 
And charms ev'ry one as she passes by, 
So beautiful, graceful, and gay; 
The swells when they see her go crazy, 
And silently wish they were free 
To walk by her side, but they are denied, 
For she will have no one but me. ( Oh!) 
CHORUS. 
She is the belle of the Avenue, 
Graceful and bright, full of fairy light, 
Sweet and enchanting with eyes of blue, 
Beaming with love and glee; 
She 
the star of socety, 
Pride of the ball with her fairy form, 
Joy and delight of her home so bright, 
And dearer than life to nie. 
Sometimes when it's fine in the afternoon 
Her ma sends her out for a 
walk ; 
"Now, darling," she'll say, " don't be long away, 
Don't stand with the young men to talk ;" 
" 
0, ma," she replies, " do not fear me— 
You know such a 
thing cannot be ;" 
Then 'smiling she goes in all her nice clothes, 
And waits on the corner for me. ( Ha ! ha!) 
She is the belle, etc. 
We walk and we talk of the latest balls, 
And view all the styles of the day, 
And when she must leave, oh! you can't conceiva 
How much I 
would wish her to stay ; 
But she will return ort the morrow,

THERE is no place so gay as the ball- room, 
When we are dancing in dreamy delight, 
When the cares of the day never greet us 
In the flash of the beautiful night ; 
But the dawn puts an end to our glory, 
And the pleasures we dearly adore, 
We must part from the scene so enchanting, 
And go home looking sleepy and sore.

Oh, it's all very well to be waltzing, 
And the pleasures we love to recall, 
But you know how you feel in the morning, 
Coming home, coming home from the ball, 
There the ladies are rivals of Venus. 
And then- smiles all around us do bestow, 
Every face wears a 
mantle of gladness, 
There is welcome wherever we go; 
But when morn comes around, we are weary-, 
And we growl at the pain in our heads, 
And we think we are foolish for dancing 
When we should have been home in our beas. 
Oh, it's all, etc. 
All around us the music is floating, 
Light and gay as the bird's happy song, 
And we sigh when the last note is over, 
Tho' we know we've been dancing too long; 
We are lost in the gladness around us, 
And we heed tint the hours as they fly, 
T:il the light peeping in through the window 
Makes us all bid each other good-bye.

Still your words are melody; 
You are always young to me.

He pressed his pining boy, 
For her he loved had gone before, 
And Willie's end was nigh; 
He bore him to his little cot,

And Willie murmured in his sleep, 
"I wish mamma was here !"

I 
wish mamma," etc. 
His darling pined that very night, 
Until the turn of tide, 
Tho anr.zel death was near him then, 
At early dawn he died. 
The father cried in wild despair, 
" 
Oh ! live, my darling dear !" 
And Willie breathed his last fond sigh, 
"

TIIRRZ'S a 
letter in the candle, 
And it points direct to me; 
How the little spark is shining, 
From whoever can it be ? 
It get's brighter still and brighter, 
Like a 
little sunny ray, 
And I 
dare to guess the writer, 
For it drives suspense away. 
CHORUS. 
Bright spark of hope, 
Shed your beams on me, 
And send a 
loving message 
From far across the sea. 
Hope and fear alike perplex me: 
Oh, superstitious dread, 
ow many idle fancies 
You conjure in my head; 
When those we love are absent, 
How wantonly you play—. 
Ev'ry shadow seeros a 
substance, 
And drives suspense away. 
Bright spark of hope, etc. 
How gladly I 
remember, 
'Tis two short months—no more, 
Since a 
letter in the candle 
Shone out as bright before; 
Then the darling messenger 
Came prompt and safe to me; 
If this is only from the same, 
How welcome it shall be. 
Bright spark of hope, etc.
