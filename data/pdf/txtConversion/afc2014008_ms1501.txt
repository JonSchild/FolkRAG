Anthropology 3
26: Folklore
 Final Exam
 Fall, 1972 
This paper is due no later than 3
:30 p.m. Friday, January 19th, 1973;
 if at all
 
possible it should be handed in by the last class meeting, January 17th.
 Please
 
do not use bluebooks; and type (preferably) or write on one side of the paper
 
only.  Please cite any references used in preparing your answers.  M
 Remember
 
that attendance at the final exam period, Monday January 22nd z*x*tf
t from 9
:00
  
to 10:00 a.m. is still absolutely required.
 
1
.  During this semester, you have read one optionally-selected book which was
 
either an autobiography, an ethnography or a personal account of a field work
 
experience.  The purpose of this assiagment was to help you recognize that folklore
 
exists within a life context but is not the whole of a life experience.  Discuss
 
at leas t three folkloric items you found in your selected book, identifying each
 
by genre, and relating them to the life-style of the people or individual whose
 
culture they express.
 
The above question is mandatory.  Please m select three
 
additional questions from the following group:
 
2
.  Discuss, being reasonably specific in your answer, how the materials (data)
 
of folklore might be usefully related to the needs of one other field of
 
m
'sz scholarship, preferably your own.
 
3
.  Comment on the following passage from The Adventures of Tom Sawyer by Samuel
 
Clemens (Mark Twain) in terms of what you know about the operation of traditional
 
belief systems:
 
You take and p split the bean and cut the wart so as to get some
 
blood and then you put the blood on one piece of the bean and take and
 
dig a hole and cury it about mid
.gight in the crossroads in the dark
 
of the moon, and then you burn up the rest of the bean.  You see that
 
piece that's got the blood on it will keep drawing and drawing, trying
 
t
o f
etch the other piece to it, and so that helps the blood to draw
 
the wart, and pretty soon, off she c
omes...
 
4.
 The process of oral transmission in folklore has sometimes been likened to
 
the familiar game of "Gossip".  In what significant ways might this be considered
 
a false analogy?
 
5
.  Using what you ksk know about traditional narrative form and content, categorize
 
(describe in technical terms) and analyse briefly the following  Hottoantot narrative.
 
u zm Non-technically speaking, I think it is beautiful.)
 
The Moon once sent an insect to man saying, "Go to man and tell them,
 
'
As I die and
., dying, live, so you shall also die and, dying life. "  The insect
 
started with the message but, while on his way, was overtaken by the hare who
 
asked, "On what errand are you bound?"  The insect answered, "I an send by the moon
 
to tell men that, as she dies, and, dying, lives, so shall they also die and,
 
dying, live. "
 
The hare said, "As you are an awkward runner, let me go."  With these
 
words ,  the hare ran off and when he reaced men, he said, "
I am sent by the Moon to
 
tell you,  '
As I die and, dying, perish, in the same manner you also shall die and
 
come wholly to an end. "
 
The hare then returned to the Moon and told her what he had said to men.
 
The Moon reproached him angrily, saying, "Do you dare tell the people a thing which
 
I have not said?"  Wuth these words, the Moon took up a piece of wood and struck the
 
Hare on the nose.  Since that day, the Hare's nose has been slit, but men believe
 
what Hare has told them.

Efik tale,  Langston Hughes, ed0  An African Treasury 0 
c0 l
ong long ago, there were no other turkeys in the world except a £.00k
 
Corn Maidens, with whom lived a l
ittle adopted girl.  Every day the l
ittle
 
drove the flock of turkeys fr o
m the corral, tended them as they grazed, and at sundot
•.
 
brought them home again, to eat for her s

he Corn Maidens had l
.-
The d
ay neared for a great corn dance in a nearby village and t
he Corn Maidens begar
 
preparing to go, m
aking themselves new moccasins and washing their long h
air.  When the
 
l
ittle girl begged t
o go, s
he was told that s
he had to l
ook after her turkeys and beci&
 
s
he had no ceremonial garments to wear.
 
At dawn on the morning of the f
iesta the l
ittle girl went out with her turkeys, s
in
 
dolefully-:  "We are going into the hole in the rock's
 That is the Underworld, where e
 
goes after death,)  The turkeys, not c
aring to die, and feeling s
orry f

ittle
 
asked her why t
he was s
o s
ad0  "I am crying because I cannot go to the fiesta.  I hay
 
no good clothes to wear, and there is no one else to take care of you "
 
The turkeys then held a council and s
aid to the l
ittle t
urkey girl, "We will giv
 
a manta and a belt and moccasins and we will take care of ourselves while you go to t
 
esta, but be s
ure t

undown to put u

anta (
the blanket dress), anotl
 
opped a woven belt, while a third and a dour t
h each d
ropped buckskin moccasins.  }'

e l
ittle turkey girl put them on and s
kipped away to the f

All day she danced and feasted and in her joy

that she had to look after her turkeys, and besides she had no ceremoz

At dawn on the morning of the fiesta the Little girl went out with h
 
turkeys, singing dolefully, "We are going into the hole in the rock."
 
(That is the Underworld where one goes after death.)  The turkeys, fbi

caring to die, and feeling sorry for the little girl, asked her why s

was so sad.
 "I am crying because I cannot go to the fiesta.  I hav ,

The turkeys then held a council and said to the little turkey gi

Herskovits started out arguing against the c
oncept of race (
following Boas).
 
Thus his earliest attempts to unscramble cultural and physical aspects resulted
 
in his insistance that Mnericani blacks had been totally culturally assimilated.
 
(
He was a political man).
 
His field work in Surinam convinced him that there were pockets of k sub-Saharan
 
African culture in New World and he b
egan to see them elsewhere.
 
He wrote in 1930's
 with a concern for the fact that African survivals in the white
 
folk mind might b
e thought equivalent to savagery or barbarism.
 
He c
ounteracted this by asserting that they were traits with a long history in
 
Africa (
pointed out positive aspects of African culture and by pointing out
 
that certain items of zxtz African culture had already been so integrated
 
into American society that we accept them now as "
American" rather than
 
"African".

P
oint out he was discussing African retentions.  Where he could not prove a specific
 
African retention, he was using the concept of re-interpretation (
adaptation of an
 
older cultural pattern to the new set of circumstances).  Syncretism -
p - -
 (
a specialized
 
form of re-interpretation) means the melding together of an item of a
iiz
e zzeztEt z
 
the original society together with a new item from the contacted society.
 
This is difficult to prove except through sheer masses of data -

work, and many people still feel that he did not prove his case.

?ennsylvania Dutch culture pattern.
 
Palatine region of south-western Germany.  Penn sent
 
agents to bring then over; first came in 1 83, bhe
 
biggest group sailed in 1709.  Relglous dissidents,
 
mixed group of P otostants from  "
iish through L
Toravians
 
to Menonites.
 
"These Palatine emigrants comprised a peasant stock from
 
ma norial villa ges in petty German baronies.  ThAir ranks
 
included no asiiring yeomanry or middle-class merchants
 
or impoverished gentry.  Bound to the soil in their home-
land, indifferent by their rel igious tenets to educational
 
dove T
hpment, dependent on traditional crafts for their
 
self-sustaining feudal economy, the Palat ines brought
 
to j
imerican a medieval folk culture, which acquired  meri-
can hues."
 Dorson, p
. 7 _7'7.

lues for culture survival and necessary conditions.
 
a.  Dialect.  "?ennsylvanish".
 
Nearly one million still
 
speak it.
 doption of English words:
 "1eIfInschurings'.
 
German order of words:  "Look the window out and see who
 
the yard is coming in".
 Frequent use of proverbs and
 
aphorisms -
-
 "No matter how lousy the dog, it still has
 
ts hangers-on". "Let every man sweep before his own
 
loor".
 Sometimes mixed with Irish dialect.
 
.
 Folk medicine.
 Specially important is "brauche" or
 
"oow-wowlng", regarded as a system for driving out dis-
ease, and dependent on faith and symoathy for its suc-
cess.
 :
ncient
 medical idea  some "brauche" formulae.
 
from 8th century in England, 10th in Germany. Dorson men-
two types of " ow-wowing" cures; drive nail gently into
 
floor (
doctor does thiI), sick one bangs it and witch dies.

clean up his barn and sick cattle improve.  kmxxmx Korson:
 
pow-wower wrote on request a charm for miners to carry,

Therefore, Jesus walketh with -  
to protect against mining disasters.

.  Visual arts and folk crafts; txx
i i tradition of
 
craftsman from Europe very strong. "Hex" signs on barns
 
apparently for ornamentation, as drive for ornamentation
 
shows up throughout P. Dutch culture -
