About Barbara Miller Byrd… 
 
Third generation circus owner, Barbara Miller Byrd was born in 1946 in Smith Center, 
Kansas to D.R. and Isla Miller. Barbara is the current owner of Carson and Barnes Circus, 
which finished its seventy-fifth season in 2011. D.R.’s father, Obert, was the first generation 
of the family involved in the circus business, starting with a dog and pony show.  
 
D.R. and Isla moved to Hugo, Oklahoma in 1941 and Barbara continues to call Hugo home. 
When she was five, Barbara performed in the circus for the first time on the swinging 
ladder. From that day on, she has performed various acts and worked multiple jobs on the 
circus from selling tickets to riding elephants to managing the budget.  
 
Barbara attended and graduated from the University of Oklahoma where she met her 
husband, Geary Byrd. They were married in 1970, and after he returned from a tour of duty 
in Vietnam, they ‘joined’ the circus together. The duo has managed the business operations 
of Carson and Barnes Circus for the last fifteen years. Barbara also oversees the Endangered 
Arc Foundation in Hugo, committed to the care and breeding of Asian elephants, a vision 
her father had many years ago.  
 
Barbara and Geary have two daughters, Traci and Kristin.  The Byrds continue to proudly 
manage and operate Carson and Barnes Circus, keeping the family tradition alive by 
providing quality entertainment to cities along their route across the United States every 
year.

My name is Juliana Nykolaiszyn with the Oklahoma State University 
Library. Also with me today is Tanya Finchum, and we’re here in Hugo, 
Oklahoma. It is Saturday, November 19, 2011, and we’re here 
interviewing Barbara Byrd as part of our oral history project of Hugo 
circus occupations. Thank you so much for joining us today.  
 
You’re welcome, glad to be here. 
 
Well, let’s begin by learning a little more about you. Could you tell us 
where you were born, the year you were born? 
 
I was born in a little town in Kansas, called Smith Center, and I was 
born July 9, 1946. 
 
And tell me a little bit about your parents. 
 
Well, my parents were wonderful people, of course. They were my 
parents. I was an only child so we were particularly close, especially my 
mother. They came from varied backgrounds. My mother was the third 
youngest child of eleven in a farmer’s family in Kansas, and they had 
very meager beginnings. They had the typical story of all the kids riding 
an old horse to school and having hand-me-down clothes, but they had a 
wonderful life because of all the siblings. She had fond memories. I was 
close to my grandparents. They used to come and stay with us when we 
were in our off-season, back down here in Oklahoma. They would come 
down from Kansas and stay with us during the winter months so that 
was a wonderful experience for me, being close to my grandparents.  
 
And then, of course, my grandfather on the other side, he traveled with 
the circus so we were always together. But my father was from a family 
of maybe a little more well-off financially people in the county. He had

teachers in his family, and his grandfather owned the hardware store in 
the town, and he also owned what was called the Opera House, and 
traveling shows used to come and perform at the Opera House. Later, 
they converted it to a silent motion picture theater. And during the time 
when they would be re-reeling the reels of film, my father and my 
grandfather would perform on stage with little dogs and ponies to 
entertain the people, while the reels were being changed. And then my 
father would sell popcorn, and that’s kind of how they got into the circus 
business.  
 
I’m third generation so it was my grandfather that really had the interest 
in the circus. They just started fiddling with dogs and ponies and 
monkeys and typical I guess you would call it a dog and pony show. 
And they started traveling around Kansas within a fifty-mile radius, 
doing little shows in little farming communities. My grandfather loved 
the animals and loved that part of it. He wasn’t like a flashy guy. He was 
very quiet, kind of unassuming, a small man, but he loved dogs, and he 
loved ponies, and he loved training them. So they got into it that way, 
just very gradually. And my father was about eight years old, I believe, 
when they actually started doing these little shows in the state. His 
mother passed away shortly thereafter, and he was taken out of school, 
even though there were schoolteachers in his family. And my 
grandfather proceeded on this career of circus business.  
 
They worked for other circuses in the beginning. They started a couple 
of other little circuses and failed. My father also had—I don’t want to 
leave him out because he was very important to the whole scheme of 
things—an older brother, named Kelly. So it was basically the three of 
them after their mother died, and they would travel around and work for 
other circuses. My grandfather was very tight-fisted with money. 
Everything they earned went back into the box to start their own circus. 
And, like I said, they started a couple and had a couple of failures.  
 
My mother, in the meantime, went through eighth grade. And, at that 
time, it was all in a one-room schoolhouse out in the country. She was 
going to go on to further her education, but they had to move into Smith 
Center, to the town. She was waiting for her sister to graduate from 
eighth grade so they could go in together and live in a boarding house or 
somewhere and try to continue on with school. But my mother and 
father met at a barn dance, and I don’t know if it was love at first sight, 
but my mother said she was very drawn to him. They married when she 
was fifteen and he was sixteen. They’d had their license for, oh, several 
months before they actually got married. And my father tells the story 
where when they got married, the minister charged them—I don’t know 
the exact figure, but it was five dollars, something like that. And then he 
turned around and gave them three dollars back as a wedding gift,

because he could tell they were going to need it. So they were married 
and they went with the circus.  
 
My mother had never even been out of the county. And the first night 
they stayed in like a pup tent, and they stayed on the edge of a game 
farm. And she heard these lions growling and trains going by, and she’d 
never experienced any of that. Also, she ended up with chicken pox on 
her wedding night. I’m sure it was a very frightening thing for a young 
girl to be in a pup tent, listening to lions and having chicken pox. But 
they went on, and they worked for a circus. She learned to perform, and 
she loved it. When I came along, it was twelve years later, and like I 
said, I’m an only child. So they were married twelve years before I was 
born. She loved the circus as much as my dad did and really devoted her 
life to the circus. It was his passion, but it grew to be hers. She was a 
wonderful woman. She really was.  
 
How did your family come to Hugo? 
 
My family came to Hugo in 1941. In traveling around the country, there 
are people in every area of the country that are circus fans. They love the 
circus. They’ll go to any circus that comes to the area. But, in traveling, 
they met a man named Vernon Pratt, who was an influential 
businessman here in Hugo. He owned the big grocery store. In fact, 
Pratt’s still have a grocery store in Shawnee, Oklahoma. So it was a very 
prominent family, but he loved the circus. And he met my parents and 
my uncle and my grandfather, and they became fast friends. My parents 
had already left Kansas. They moved south gradually, looking for 
warmer climate as they acquired more animals, looking for a place 
where the winters wouldn’t be quite as severe as Kansas.  
 
So they moved first over to Springfield, Missouri, and then they moved 
to Joplin, Missouri, then they came down to Mena, Arkansas. Then Mr. 
Pratt talked them into coming to Hugo with the promise of free water for 
the animals for life. That was one of the big draws to come to Hugo so 
they did come to Hugo. By that time they had one elephant. And my 
mother and father lived in the truck, in the front—one part of the truck 
with the elephant, and the elephant lived in the back part. They parked 
up as you’re going out of town, if you go through town and on the way 
to Paris, Texas, there’s a corner down there. When you live in a town 
you don’t always remember the names of the streets, but it’s still in 
town. But on the way out towards Paris, there was a building there. And 
I don’t know if Mr. Pratt owned it or what, but he let them park there the 
first winter.  
 
So the first winter in Hugo, my mom and dad lived in the truck with the 
elephant. The rest of the equipment, I guess they parked there so they

would have maybe lights or something for the elephant. I don’t know 
why they got to park behind this building, but the other people were 
parked out at what they called the poor farm. And, again, I don’t 
know—as a child, you hear this, but I never said, “Well, Mom, what was 
the poor farm?” It was a piece of property out there where they let them 
park. And then they bought the farm across the street from where we’re 
sitting today. It was an established farm, and they bought the acreage. 
My grandfather moved into the little house on the property, and the 
elephant got a barn. So my mother always joked and said that the 
elephant had a house before she did, because she was still living in what 
we would call a RV now, but back then it a was very crude-type mobile 
home.  
 
They were very fortunate to find this community, because the 
community has always opened their arms up to us, and we’ve always felt 
at home here. We didn’t always get free water. We pay for our water 
now, but it’s always been a good town. (Laughter) I was born in ’46 so 
they actually came here before I was born. And the only reason I was 
born in Kansas was because I was born in the summertime and the circus 
was touring. So my mother went back to Kansas to have me, and then I 
returned to the circus when I was two weeks old. So that’s how we got 
to Hugo, and we’ve been here ever since.  
 
One funny story, my father was always a dreamer. My grandfather and 
uncle were more realists and kind of settled, but my father always had 
big dreams, and so he found a property on further south in Texas one 
time. This was probably back in the late ’50s, I’d say. He found a ranch 
down there for sale that he thought would be perfect for our winter 
quarters. He wanted to make one more move further south, and it was 
going to cost fifty thousand dollars. Back then, that was—it’s still a lot 
of money—but back then, that was a fortune. So I guess they each had 
equal vote, and democracy rules. My grandfather and uncle voted no and 
my father voted yes. But it turned out that it was where the ballpark is 
and Six Flags and everything, in Arlington, that’s where it would’ve 
been. We always joked with them that we didn’t make that next move 
south. But we’ve always been happy here in Hugo, and I think the 
people of Hugo have really kind of adopted the circus, because as you 
go through the community, you’ll see a lot of evidence that the circus is 
here. 
 
What is your earliest circus memory? 
 
My earliest circus memory—I wish I was one of those people that could 
remember the day they were born, but I can’t. And sometimes I don’t 
know if I’m really remembering what happened or if I’m remembering 
the stories that were told about what happened. But really, my earliest 
 
 
8
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
memories are of riding the pony in the—we called it a spec. It’s short for 
spectacular, but it’s really the parade that happens during the 
performance of the circus. And I remember riding the pony under the 
tent, in the circus. And I had a little gold cocker spaniel, named 
Goldie—that’s original—and Goldie used to follow me everywhere. So 
when I was about five years old, I learned to do a little—it’s called 
swinging ladder, and it’s the first thing that all the little girls in the circus 
learn to do. It basically looks like a trellis ladder, but it’s hung, and it has 
a little loop on it, and you swing back and forth and do little poses on it. 
My mother was the swinger, and my little dog used to come in the ring 
with us and watch me go back and forth.  
 
It was a wonderful life. And looking back now, I realize how magical it 
was, but as a child, you take your surroundings for granted. I mean, it 
was a wonderful playground, and you got to travel everywhere and be 
applauded for doing a silly little trick, with your dog watching you, in 
the center ring. And it was a great life. I got to be around the animals, 
and I traveled with my mother and father, my grandfather, my uncle, my 
aunt. My uncle and aunt had a daughter, also an only child, and her 
name was Karen. She was eight years older than me and so I always 
looked up to her. So it was a magical life.  
 
The circus is, maybe some people wouldn’t think so, but the circus is a 
wonderful place to raise a child. It’s a really protective community, and 
everyone’s always watching out for the kids, but yet you have this 
freedom to run across the lot. There’s the horses and the elephants, but 
there’s always a set of eyes watching you and very protective of the 
children. We got to travel. I’ve been everywhere in the United States and 
seen probably, not every park, but I’ve been to the majority of national 
parks and the wonderful cities of the United States. But then you come 
back to little Hugo in southeastern Oklahoma, and you have roots. And 
that was the great part of my particular life in the circus, because I had, I 
always felt, the best of both worlds. I had the roots and the community 
of Hugo, but yet I had this opportunity to travel and do all these exciting 
things.  
 
Some circus children don’t have the opportunities I had, because I went 
to the same school system all my life until I graduated and went on to 
university. Some children don’t have that, that chance that I had in 
circus business. Their parents are artists, performers that travel from 
circus to circus, and they don’t have that root. But as you talk to circus 
people in Hugo, I believe that anyone that traveled with the circuses in 
Hugo felt that sense of having a home, because they were always 
welcome back to Hugo and felt a part of the community. They didn’t 
feel like the outsider or the weird circus person. The children didn’t 
make fun of them because of their parents’ occupation or because they

traveled and their home was only on wheels. The children here were 
accustomed to that so they didn’t make fun of them. I think Hugo has 
been good for circus.  
 
So you would come home and attend school during the school year? 
 
Yes, yes. I went through school just like any normal child. I’ve got my 
first grade picture, my second grade picture, my third grade picture, all 
with the same children that were my friends, and still are my friends, 
here in Hugo. 
 
And would your mom come off the road, too? 
 
Yes. What we did was, as long as I was doing well in school, they would 
let me leave in March, when my parents left for the circus to start. And 
my parents always saw to it that I came back when school started, but 
the teachers would let me take my books. And I still have letters from 
my friends that were students, where they would write to me and send 
me the letters while I was on the road, telling me what was going on in 
school and how much they missed me. And some of them are most 
prominent citizens here now, but I still have the little letters that the 
teachers would have them write me. It was a magical, enchanted life I 
led. Problems of adulthood eventually hit me in the face, but at that time 
there was not a care in the world. 
 
Well, you started with swinging ladder. What are other acts that you 
may have gravitated towards as you were growing up? 
 
Well, I was the owner’s daughter so I usually did anything that either no 
one else wanted to do or that maybe someone broke their leg and 
couldn’t do. But I always say I was kind of a jack-of-all-trades. I wasn’t 
very good at any of it, but I did it all. So it’s a very varied list. I rode the 
elephants, and I rode dressage horses, I worked ponies in the ring, I wore 
a pumpkin head. I mean, anything that my parents, or my father 
particularly, asked of me, I tried to do. I walked tight wire, I did an act 
called bounding rope. It was a thick rope and you had a pole. It was kind 
of like a ballerina-type costume, and you used to do like different little 
poses on this rope. It sounds silly when you talk about it, but it was fun 
and I enjoyed it. It was funny. I learned to do an act. I used to practice 
every day after school. They had a trainer for me in the old barn across 
the street, and so I would practice over there every day after school, 
especially after grade school.  
 
After I got into junior high I was a cheerleader, and I was in the band, 
and I had a lot of different activities. But in grade school, I had practiced 
almost every day, and I had learned to do a little single trapeze act where

you hang by your heels and your toes. It was funny, I never got to 
perform that act, because we had an employee on the circus that was 
very important to us and his wife learned to work that act. So my parents 
decided, “Well, we’ll let her perform instead of you.” But it was still 
good training. I enjoyed doing it. I did Spanish web, which is kind of a 
step up from the swinging ladder. All the girls learned to do the Spanish 
web, and that’s just a rope hung. You do basically the same tricks that 
you do on the swinging ladder, but it’s on a rope, and you climb up and 
do the poses on it. And let’s see. What else did I do?  
 
Like I said, I kind of did anything that no one else wanted to do. I 
progressed onto the concession department. I made cotton candy. When 
I graduated from high school that was about the last year that I 
performed, and my parents decided that it was time for me to move into 
the office, that they could hire people to do that but they needed some 
family members in the office. So I went into the office. Of course, I’d 
already started with my grandfather when I was twelve years old. I used 
to collect tickets on the main gate. My grandfather was losing his sight 
in his older years, but it was funny. He could tell a twenty dollar bill 
from a five dollar bill. (Laughs) No one took advantage of him when it 
came to money. But that was a wonderful experience, working with my 
grandfather out on the gate, collecting tickets from the patrons as they 
came in. So I sold tickets.  
 
One year, after I was an adult, our cook quit, and I was already married 
to my husband then. And so we went into the cookhouse, and we cooked 
in the cookhouse for about three weeks. That’s one of the hardest jobs 
on the circus, is trying to make one hundred, two hundred people happy 
with their food every day, and they’re usually not. It was funny, because 
my mother-in-law lived in Lawton, Oklahoma, and there was a Vo-Tech 
school over there. So she went and she got two graduates from the 
culinary school at the Vo-Tech center. They came up to take over our 
cookhouse, and they arrived on my birthday so my husband put bows all 
over them and brought them up to the cookhouse. That was my birthday 
present, to get sprung out of there. (Laughs) It was funny. I’ve done 
everything on the circus, really. I haven’t physically put the tent up and 
down, but I’ve helped carry poles or when the wind hits, I’ve tried to 
help guy out so it wouldn’t blow over and done whatever I could. 
 
Growing up, did you always think that you wanted to be involved with 
the circus? 
 
I guess I always did. I knew that I was going to complete my education, 
and I graduated from OU [University of Oklahoma]. But I guess I never 
made a conscious decision of, “This is going to be my path in life.” I met 
Geary at OU. He was an engineering major. He had never been to a

circus before he met me. We got married a year after we graduated. He 
went to Vietnam, and so I came back on the circus with my parents, to 
stay while he was gone. And I guess I just assumed I would go and do 
whatever Geary wanted to do. We were going to build roads and bridges 
or whatever, being a civil engineer. When he came back from Vietnam 
he was going to get his master’s, and we went back to the campus. This 
was kind of a tumultuous time, the early ’70s, and I don’t know, we just 
didn’t seem to fit in.  
 
In the time he was gone, the governor had changed, and the programs to 
help the Vietnam vets had changed so we were just kind of in a flux. So 
my dad said, “Well, come on. Come with the circus. Just follow me 
around for six months, and you might like it.” And I had also determined 
in that six months that I was gone, before he went to Vietnam, that I was 
sad. There was something missing, and I didn’t realize it would be like 
that until I was married and was taken out of this element. Basically, 
except for when I was away at school, I had never been away from the 
circus. And I guess I didn’t think I would miss it as much as I did. I 
found that I missed it tremendously.  
 
So when he came back and my dad said that, we decided to just go. He 
got back in July, and it wasn’t time to start school anyway, and so we 
would just at least take one semester for him to decide what he wanted 
to do. We got married in ’70, and that was ’71. He was gone, he left in 
July of ’70 and came back in July of ’71, and we’ve been here ever 
since. He said Vietnam was great training for the circus. (Laughs) He 
learned how to sleep anywhere, eat anything, and work under very 
adverse conditions. So he’s been a great guy to do this, and he basically 
loves it now as much as I do. He’s devoted all of his life to it. We’ll be 
married forty-two years in January so he’s as much of a pro at it as I am 
now.  
 
After college and after you all decided you were going to settle in with 
the circus, were you more involved with business operations at this 
point? 
 
Yes. Well, actually, I had our first daughter, Traci, in ’72, and then our 
second daughter [Kristin] came along in ’75, and so I was kind of 
involved in raising them. (Laughs) I did help. I helped with the 
costuming, I helped with the performance direction, I would still fill in 
anywhere they needed me, to sell tickets or whatever. But I didn’t really 
get into the office part of it until about fifteen years ago, where I was in 
the office on a daily basis. I was more involved with, like I said, the 
costuming and the performance and raising my girls. 
 
Can you talk a little bit more about the costuming?

Oh, yes! Back when we were making it in our basement, we changed 
themes every year. We would come up with a new theme. And at that 
time, we probably had maybe sixty or seventy people performers in the 
circus, plus the animals you have to costume, also. And so it was quite a 
task. It was a full-time job. We would be in our basement eight, nine, 
ten, twelve hours a day, making the costumes. We went from the design 
to purchasing the materials to cutting out. It went all the way through the 
process in our basement. And sometimes it’s harder to fit the animals 
than it is the people. It’s harder to get them to stand still. But at that 
time, we were carrying with us eighteen or twenty elephants so we made 
each elephant a blanket. And they were very detailed. We had a Mexican 
theme, a South American theme. We had a Knights of the Round Table, 
we had a Roaring ’20s, we had an Under the Sea. I mean, every year we 
would have a different theme. It was quite a time consuming and very 
expensive thing that we did.  
 
And then, of course, on the road there were always repairs and making 
of things that got destroyed. The elephant might eat the corner off of one 
of the blankets or something, or it would get blown off and caught onto a 
tent stake and get torn. There were always repairs to be made. So it was 
a very all encompassing task, making the costumes, but that’s the icing 
on the cake. If they went in there in their street clothes, it wouldn’t be 
very pretty. So I think it’s a very important part of the circus. And we 
carry the tradition on today. We are constantly making new costumes.  
 
We don’t have quite as many performers as we used to. We’ve 
condensed it down to a one-ring circus, and I often wonder what my dad 
would think of that, because like I said, he was a dreamer, and he always 
wanted the tent so big that you couldn’t see from one end to the other. 
And he accomplished that, but with today’s economic times and with the 
rules and regulations, government oversight and just the complicated 
world we live in today, we have downsized. But we have a wonderful 
product, and we get rave reviews everywhere we go. So I’m hoping that 
it would only be my father that would be critical, not the public. 
 
I was kind of sad, one time I was sitting in the tent. And we had actually 
gone from a five-ring circus down to three so we hadn’t even gone down 
to the one-ring yet. And I was sitting in there, kind of melancholy. It was 
the night before we were going to open, and the lights were very dim, 
and I was sitting in the seats. And in walked David Rawls’ father, Harry 
Rawls, who I hope you were able to speak to before he passed away. 
And he walked in and said, “What’s the matter, Barbara?” We were 
setting up over at Paris, and he had come over to check out the 
operation. And I said, “Oh, I was just feeling kind of sad, Harry. I was 
wondering what my father would think of cutting down to three rings.”

And he said, “Well, I want to tell you one thing, Barbara.” He said, 
“Your father is probably mad at you, but,” he said, “your grandfather is 
so proud.” My grandfather never wanted to have that big colossus of a 
circus. He wanted to have the smaller, more intimate family experience-
type circus. So it made me feel better that he thought my granddad 
would be okay with the idea. 
 
I know that my father would be happy that the show is still continuing. 
He wouldn’t care what form it was in, and when he says he would be 
mad at me, he really wouldn’t be mad at me. He would just be so proud 
that we’re forging on, that no matter what it takes, we’re going to keep 
this operation going. And if it has to be one-ring, has to be thirty or forty 
performers, has to be three or five elephants instead of [thirty], that’s 
okay because it’s still continuing the tradition, keeping the circus going.  
 
Backing up just a little bit, I think the two circuses that I associate with 
your family are Al G. Kelly Miller and Carson and Barnes. 
 
Yes, right. 
 
Can you talk a little bit about Al G. Kelly Miller? 
 
Yes. When I talked about my childhood and of growing up and how 
wonderful it was, that was on Al G. Kelly and Miller Brothers. Miller is 
my maiden name. They used to be called Miller Brothers Circus, and as 
most people in Oklahoma know, there was a famous Miller’s 101. So it 
was kind of a confusion there. We used to even get some of their mail. I 
don’t know whether they got any of ours or not, but we used to. And as 
they went along, they thought they needed to differentiate the name a 
little more. So there was a famous traveling circus back in the, probably 
’20s, ’30s, called Al G. Barnes Circus, and that kind of had a ring. They 
liked that. So they kind of pilfered the Al G., and they put the Kelly on 
because that was my uncle’s first name.  
 
So they called it Al G. Kelly and Miller Brothers Circus. That was the 
one they actually formed in 1937, and it was in business until the mid-
’60s, late-’60s. And my father, he went through some downtime, 
because my uncle died at a very young age. He was only forty-six years 
old when he passed away. And then my grandfather died in 1969. I was 
married in ’70. And I think my dad went through kind of a really hard 
time for him, because his mentor and his brother were gone, and he 
didn’t really know if he was capable or able or even wanted to try to 
keep going. So he had started I don’t know how many circuses in his 
lifetime, lots of them right down in Hugo. There was Famous Cole, and 
there was Tex Carson. There were several different shows that he had 
started, and he had started Carson and Barnes Circus with a gentleman

named Jack Moore and his family so it was in operation. It was founded 
in the ’50s, and it was operating simultaneously with Al G. Kelly and 
Miller Brothers Circus. We didn’t travel with it, but my father had 
financed it, and Mr. Moore was running and operating it with his family. 
 
As Al G. Kelly and Miller Brothers kind of took a back seat, it actually 
went off the road for a while. He had it about twenty-five years. David 
Rawls was a young man that worked for us, and he came from a long 
history of circus families. And he’s ambitious, and he was running our 
concession department. My husband and he are about the same age. 
They were friends and they often discussed that David didn’t want to do 
this his whole life. He wanted to be a circus owner and manager, and so 
my husband put the bug in my dad’s ear, that David would probably be 
leaving if we didn’t do something with him, to hang on to him.  
 
And so my father bought an old, defunct circus, and David put the elbow 
grease in it. My dad put some of the finances behind it, and they took it 
back out. And that would’ve been about thirty years ago. So have to do 
the math there—and David ran it successfully for twenty-five years 
before he decided to retire. And he wasn’t out of it but for about six 
months, then John Ringling North [II] came along, who’s a descendent 
of the famous Ringling family, and I think he wanted a hobby. And so 
he bought the circus. By this time, the name had been shortened down 
to, legally, to just Kelly Miller Circus. David thought the Al G. Kelly 
and Miller Brothers was a little wordy so he condensed it down to just 
the current title of Kelly Miller Circus.  
 
And how we ended up on Carson and Barnes was, during this kind of 
downtime for my father, Mr. Moore developed cancer, and his wife 
asked us if we would come over and kind of help. So we went over, I 
worked in the office, we ran the concessions, and my father was just 
kind of there to support him. He did pass away and Ann [Angela] didn’t 
want to continue so my father bought her 50 percent of the operation, 
and we were right back in the middle of circus business again. So I 
called Carson and Barnes Al G. Kelly Miller Brothers and everybody 
did for a long, long time until we finally got it into our heads that we 
were on another circus with another title. But my father built that circus 
from a very small operation into the largest traveling circus in the United 
States. And that’s when we had the five rings, a lot of elephants, a lot of 
animals, a lot of people. At one time we had almost 250 people that were 
traveling and moving everyday to a different location. It was a huge 
undertaking. 
 
The logistics… 
 
Oh, it was mindboggling. The armed services actually went and studied

Ringling Brothers when they were under tent to see how they did what 
they did, because Ringling Brothers, in its heyday under the tent, had 
two thousand employees, and they had five hundred horses. They 
traveled by train, but they moved this huge colossus thing in a very 
orderly and organized manner. And we get tickled, really, when we 
hear—I think the media in this day and age kind of use the circus in a 
negative light. And it really drives me crazy because they’ll—the O.J. 
trial or the whatever, “It’s a circus! It’s a circus!” And if they only knew 
how organized and orderly a circus is, they wouldn’t even think about 
using that in the terms that they’re using it today, because there’s 
nothing chaotic or disorderly or unorganized about the movement of a 
circus. It’s very coordinated, and it’s time-driven, and everyone knows 
their job. You come to see our circus set up, you won’t see any 
screaming or hollering. Everybody knows their job, they do their job.  
 
People ask me, “How do you get them to move so fast and to do that job 
so well?” I said, “Well, they get a salary. They don’t get paid by the 
hour. When they’re finished, they’re off.” So they kind of keep moving 
along, but it’s not a negative word. Circus is a positive word, and it’s 
brought joy and entertainment to millions and millions of people all over 
the world for centuries. So it should be seen in a positive light, and it 
kind of ruffles me every time I hear the media use it in that manner.  
 
You talked about your father being a big dreamer. And I think something 
else the circus industry associates your family with are elephants. 
 
Oh, absolutely. 
 
Could you talk a little bit about that? 
 
Yes. 
 
Did he just wake up one day and say, “I think we need a whole lot of 
elephants.”? 
 
Well, he loved elephants. And, like I say, when my parents moved to 
town, my mother lived in the truck with the elephant. The elephant came 
first, and it had a home before my mother had a home. And they just 
have always loved elephants, especially my father more so I’d say than 
my uncle and my grandfather. And so he wanted to have more elephants 
than anyone. I mean, that was his big dream. And at one time, he did 
have fifty elephants, and so he’s always been associated with elephants. 
All of his life he loved to work with them and train them.  
 
When I was a baby, my mother tells stories about how they would go on 
the off-season and they would take their elephants. They made a Tarzan

movie in Hollywood one time, which is always hysterical because, I 
think, Tarzan was in Africa and these were Asian elephants, but no one 
paid any attention. And they would go and make like the big Shrine 
dates in the coliseums during the wintertime, and they performed with 
elephants since before I was born. My mother tells a story, like I said, 
she was a little farm girl from Kansas, never even seen an elephant. And 
so when they finally got their first elephant, my dad was so proud, and 
he brings this elephant in. So my mother’s going to style the act for him, 
be the beauty in there with the big pondering elephant. And so my dad 
says, “Lay down.” And he was kind of a jokester anyway, “Lay down.” 
So she laid down. So he brings this elephant, and this elephant is going 
to step over her. The first thing she did was got up and ran, of course, 
but it did go into the act. And eventually, the elephant did step over her, 
and she did all the mounts and everything.  
 
But they just always loved elephants. And when they passed away they 
actually left their estate directly to the elephants. They had already given 
property to the elephants, to the Endangered Ark Foundation, 120 acres. 
So we used their estate to erect the buildings that house the elephants 
and the exercise pens, and we have some left in a fund for perpetual care 
of the elephants. It was very important to them, that they felt they were a 
part of our family, and that they stay together, and that we care for them 
until they pass on. So that was an important part, and he also set up the 
breeding program and wanted there to be baby elephants around us. And 
he wanted there always to be elephants in the United States, because it is 
predicted —at one time and maybe still is—that if the birthrate didn’t 
change, then by the year 2050 they would be extinct in the United States. 
We have the second largest gene pool of Asian elephants in the United 
States next to Ringling Brothers, and so we’re a very vital part of trying 
to see that the Asian elephant doesn’t disappear from the United States. 
We don’t have much control over the rest of the world, but hopefully we 
can keep them coming here.   
 
And in the early days, they were named after…? 
 
Oh, yes. They’re still named after members of our family. That’s a very 
important thing if you get an elephant named after you. Our latest baby, 
as you may have well known, was born in April. It was a little boy, and 
the town got the honor of having him named after Hugo. But before that, 
we had a little girl and she was named Val, after my mother-in-law, 
Valine. And we have a Traci, and we have a Kristin, and we have a Lisa, 
Libby was my grandmother. At one time, in the ’70s, my father got 
twelve elephants at one time, and so seven of them were named after my 
mother’s sisters and her. I actually have a picture of them, the elephants, 
when they were small, with each aunt that was their namesake. That’s a 
treasure because they’ve all passed on now, and they got a big kick out

of it. Isa’s had a couple of babies. Well, my real Aunt Isa never had 
children, and so she got a big thrill out of her elephant, Isa, being 
pregnant and having babies. As you look around my home, I have 
elephants everywhere. Elephants have always been a very important part 
of our lives. 
 
How long has the oldest one been with the family? 
 
My namesake was Barbara, and we lost her two summers ago. She was 
sixty-eight years old. Our oldest elephant now is probably Minnie. 
Minnie and Susie are almost the same age. I performed with Minnie in 
the ring when I was about twelve years old, and she was probably about 
five years old. I’m sixty-five now so she’s getting on up there, but she’s 
semi-retired. She only does just a little bit of traveling, not much at all, 
and she will be retired soon. But the elephants, they’re kind of creatures 
of habit, and they’ve been doing this all their lives. They ride along with 
us, they’ve been moving and performing, and they know when it’s time 
to get in the truck and go to the next town. And when they get to the 
next town, they put their trunks up in the air, and they kind of smell 
around and try to see, “Well, what’s this new town going to offer?” And 
I think they’re kind of like people. Sometimes people, when they retire, 
they think it’s going to be wonderful, but it really isn’t. So I think 
elephants are kind of like that. I think as long as they’re healthy and 
they’re not in any pain, they should keep performing, they keep their 
muscles toned, and that’s what their life has been. And I’m not retired 
yet so Minnie will keep going for a little while. (Laughs) 
 
So they live to be seventy-five-ish? 
 
Well, they live to be in their mid-sixties, late-sixties. We have never had 
any that have reached seventy, but hopefully, we will someday. 
 
I kind of want to get into you as the owner/operator of Carson and 
Barnes, but I do want to step back and talk about when your father 
passed away. Did he pass away on the road? 
 
Yes, my father passed away in McCook, Nebraska. It was about time for 
the circus to start, the afternoon performance, and he had a motor 
home—my mother had already passed away. My mother passed away 
eleven months before my father did, and they were almost married sixty-
five years, I believe it was. As a child, you—maybe everyone doesn’t—
but I often wondered which of my parents would do better if one of them 
passed away. I think it would’ve been my mother because my father, 
like I said, only lasted eleven months. He was visiting the show after my 
mother had passed away. He came on, fell, and broke his hip, and so that 
was kind of the start of the bad stuff. It wasn’t so much the hip; he

passed away from his heart. He had a heart attack, but he had a rough go 
with the hip.  
 
He was a very proud man, and he used to drive himself to his physical 
therapy in Paris. He wouldn’t let anybody else drive him so he’d put the 
walker in, and he’d drive over to do his physical therapy. And I think 
maybe he felt like he was going to be limited, and he kind of went 
downhill. He did pass away in McCook, Nebraska, and he passed away 
while his circus was touring. Actually, my youngest daughter, Kristin, 
drove his motor home over, and he was riding with her, and he had a 
heart attack so they had taken him to the hospital in McCook before I 
even got there.  
 
So as soon as I got there, they started motioning and I could tell 
something was wrong. I didn’t even park my trailer. I just jumped out, 
got in a car, and they took me down to the hospital. But he was doing 
better when I got there. They were going to release him, and so they told 
us to bring him back at nine o’clock in the morning. I have a little hard 
feelings for the hospital there, because he never actually saw a doctor. 
He saw a physician’s assistant. He was an eighty-three-year-old man that 
had come in with an obvious heart attack. I said, if he’d been the mayor 
in the town, they’d probably air-flighted him to Lincoln. But he was just 
the circus guy coming through town so they sent him home and told him 
to come back at nine o’clock in the morning and they’d look at him. 
Well, he died at four o’clock that afternoon. And he died in his motor 
home on the circus grounds, which was probably preferable to him, 
anyway.  
 
When we picked him up at the hospital and we were talking, asking him 
how he felt, of course, and my husband and I and our two daughters 
were in the car with him, and we were driving back to the fairgrounds 
where the circus was set up. He said that—and I had never heard this 
story—he said that this was the first town he had ever seen a circus in 
and that when he was a little boy, his father and mother had brought he 
and his brother Kelly from the Smith Center area of Kansas up to 
McCook, Nebraska, to see a circus. It was called the John Robinson 
Circus, and I later had someone look it up, and it would’ve been in 1924. 
They had records of the circus being in there. So he told us about his 
experience of coming and seeing his first circus. We got back to the 
fairgrounds and, of course, like I said, it was just about time for the band 
to strike up for the four-thirty show, and he died at his motor home. But 
it was really—it was almost like it was full-circle. And the weight that 
that story took off of my shoulders, I can’t even describe to you how it 
felt. If I had never heard that story, I think I would’ve been completely 
devastated. There was something about that story that he had come full-
circle from that little boy seeing his first circus to this famous circus

owner seeing his last circus. It was a very moving experience for me and 
for my family.  
 
He had basically planned his own funeral. He had already purchased his 
own coffin. It was a shiny red coffin with brassy gold trim. And he 
always said, “You can get a lot of publicity out of this, for the circus.” 
So we did. We got a lot of publicity off of it. But he didn’t want to be 
buried while his circus was touring. He wanted to be buried after his 
circus came home. So it was also strange because we were in McCook, 
Nebraska, but we were heading to Colorado. The only people in the 
world besides the people here in Hugo that I know that own a funeral 
home happened to be in Denver, Colorado. They’re relatives of relatives 
so we called them and they said, “We’ll come get him.” So they picked 
him up in McCook. We had a couple of moves in between, and we 
ended up in a Littleton, Colorado over the weekend. They had already 
gotten my father. We went down that morning before we left McCook. 
My husband and our two daughters, and we picked out a very plain, 
wooden casket for him to be transported in because we knew he had this 
shiny one back home. And they came and picked him up, they took him 
to Littleton, to Denver, and they prepared him for a funeral.  
 
We had two shows in Littleton, but we had a service in the tent between 
shows. It was a wonderful service. We gave our show, we had full 
capacity people, which my father would’ve loved, we ran them out, and 
we all came in, and he was brought into the tent by a young male 
elephant pulled in on a wagon, and he was placed on elephant tubs, 
which are the big tubs that the elephants perform on in the ring. His 
casket was placed there, we had some flowers, we had music over the 
sound system. At that time, we actually had some Catholic nuns that 
traveled with us. We’re not Catholic, but the majority of our employees 
were so we had some Catholic nuns that have done this for forty or fifty 
years, traveled with circuses. And they happened to be traveling with us 
at that time so they helped greatly with the service. Our minister from 
Hugo flew in and some friends flew in from all over, and we actually 
had a service, right there, in between the shows on the circus, just like I 
think he would’ve enjoyed.  
 
But he didn’t, like I said, want to be buried while his circus was on tour 
so our friends in Denver took him back to their mortuary, and they put 
him on cold storage until the circus tour was over in November. Then 
when we came home, we had the one that got us all the publicity. 
(Laughs) The one in Littleton, Colorado was very quiet and private, but 
the one that we had in Hugo was covered around the world. I received 
clippings from around the world from newspapers, and it was covered 
quite heavily here in Oklahoma. It was on the front page of the Tulsa 
World, the Daily Oklahoman, of course, our paper here in town and the

Paris paper. And it was a glorious day in the fall, and I think everything 
went just like he would’ve planned it. David Rawls and Trey Key 
actually helped us quite a lot, because it took place just two days or three 
days after we came home, and so I wouldn’t have had time to coordinate 
everything.  
 
They set the Kelly Miller tent up out at the fairgrounds, we put the seats 
in it, we set the rings up, the lighting. Again, he was placed on the 
elephant tubs in the center ring, and circus owners from all over the 
United States flew in. They were his pallbearers. All the townspeople 
came out, and it was really a celebration of his life and of his love of the 
circus. Very moving, many people—we had representatives from the 
community that spoke. We had representatives from the circus world 
that spoke. My daughter composed a poem. Our minister, again, 
conducted the services. And from the fairgrounds, we had a parade. We 
paraded to the cemetery. We even have a video. Someone produced a 
video of it, and they closed the schools. The businesses closed down, 
and there were hundreds and hundreds of people that stood on the 
sidewalk for the procession to the cemetery, and we made it a circus 
parade.  
 
We had camels, elephants, and horses. Mr. Rawls and Mr. Key had 
arranged to have a circus band there, and they brought circus wagons in 
from historical museums from Peru, Indiana and different places. We 
had a circus band up on top of the parade wagon. He was in a horse-
drawn hearse and—my father was—and we had the elephants decked 
out in their best blankets, and the lead elephant actually carried the 
flowers that were placed on his coffin. They carried it to the cemetery. 
And when we got there the band played. Of course, he served in World 
War II, he served in Europe and so he had the military burial also, but it 
was quite an affair. As we went along the city streets, people held up 
signs thanking him for all the fun memories of the circus and the good 
times. It was quite moving. 
 
The way he would’ve wanted it. 
 
Yes, exactly the way he would’ve wanted it. He got a lot of publicity, 
and even in his death, he brought a lot of smiles to—there were clowns 
in the parade, and so it was a great day. 
 
What do you think your mother would’ve thought? 
 
Oh, Bette Midler’s song, “The Wind Beneath Your Wings,” well, she 
was that to him. She was the rock in the family, and she always took 
second place behind him, but she was really holding him up. She was a 
wonderful lady and one of the strongest people I ever knew or ever will

know. 
 
Well, at this point, I guess there was no doubt in your mind that the 
circus was going to continue. 
 
Well, pretty much so. He kind of said it had to, so—and everyone 
usually listened to him. But he also gave other sage advice. He said, “It 
can break you so don’t let it break you,” and so that’s one reason we’ve 
tried to cut down is because we want to keep it going, but it’s very, very 
costly in this day and age to keep it going. That’s one reason why we’ve 
made it smaller, is to try to keep it going. But he would be happy. He 
would be happy with our attempt, and he never got to know his great-
grandchildren, but he helped raise his granddaughters, and he would be 
very proud of them today, and of me and my husband.  
 
Well, here in Hugo at the Mount Olivet Cemetery, we have Showmen’s 
Rest. Can you talk a little bit about how all of that got started? 
 
Sure. We had a gentleman that worked for us, and he was just a drifter 
that came on as a teenager and ended up spending his whole life with us. 
His name was John Carroll, and he worked with the animals. And 
especially back in the old days, some of the guys that would come along, 
they were drifters and didn’t really have family connections, and so the 
circus kind of ended up being their family and their home, and they 
spent their lives here. So John Carroll was one of those characters. He 
had lost his eye in an accident, and he received like an insurance 
settlement. I think it was seventeen thousand dollars or something, and 
he didn’t have a family. About five or six years later, he passed away. 
And unbeknownst to my father, he had left this insurance settlement to 
my father. My dad didn’t know what to do with it, and about that same 
time my uncle passed away, and that was in 1960.  
 
So he got the idea of making this place where circus people would be 
buried, because a lot of times circus people, like I say, don’t have roots, 
and they would be buried in Timbuktu. Nobody would ever know who 
they were or know this rich history that they had or anything about them. 
So he thought it would be cool to have this area where circus people 
could be buried and that there would always be somebody that would 
come and visit that would be able to tell stories about that person or have 
a connection. It was just going to be a place where they wouldn’t be 
forgotten. So when my uncle died, he took this John Carroll money, and 
he purchased this area at Mount Olivet. He named it Showmen’s Rest. 
My uncle was the first person buried there.  
 
My father buried John Carroll there. He has one of the biggest 
headstones out there. I don’t know if you’ve been there or not, but his is

quite large. And then my father —what was left, he invested it so that it 
would always be earning money. And he had it fixed so that if 
somebody died in the circus business and wanted to be buried there, if 
they didn’t have the means or the family, that John Carroll’s fund would 
supply the plot and put a small marker. And if you’ll notice while you’re 
at the cemetery, there’ll be some small markers that say, “Donated by 
the John Carroll fund.” It’s worked quite well. We’re almost full. We 
only have just a few plots left, and we’re trying to figure out how we can 
expand. But that was the basis of it, how it got started. It was an 
inheritance from one of our workers that didn’t have family and left the 
money to my father, and my father had this vision of a place that would 
be like it is today. It’s really become a landmark in Hugo.  
 
I’m always amazed. I go out to change the flowers on my parents’ and 
my grandfather and step-mother’s graves, oh, four times a year or 
something, and I’m always amazed when I’m there. It never fails that at 
least one group will stop by, or maybe just a couple, or maybe a bus tour 
will stop by to be looking at this particular part of this community 
cemetery. So it has gotten quite a bit of notoriety around, at least in the 
state, and it was in Southern Living magazine one time, and it’s gotten 
some national publicity. It’s kind of a tourist place in Hugo. And you 
always feel kind of silly asking people, “Well, you’ve been to the 
library, you’ve been to the museum, you’ve been here, you’ve been 
there. Have you been to the cemetery yet?” And they kind of give you a 
funny look. But it’s a really neat place, and it kind of gives you a sense 
of well-being when you are there to know that these people will never be 
forgotten. 
 
And a lot of people who are buried there have been so closely tied to the 
circuses in Hugo. 
 
Yes. 
 
And not only just to Hugo. 
 
Oh, absolutely. There’s our circus mechanic, and there’s our trapeze 
star, and there’s just all these different people there that have lived in 
Hugo and are known in the community. But there’s also people buried 
there that just wanted to be where other circus people are buried, which 
it may sound corny, but that was their desire. So there are people there 
from California. There’s a young man that was killed in a train accident 
with Ringling Brothers who never worked for our circuses in Hugo or 
never lived in Hugo, but he wanted to be buried there. And so there are a 
number of people there that really have requested to come from many 
different parts of the United States to be buried there.

You said you’re uncle was the first to be buried there? 
 
Yes. 
 
Did your father design the stone? 
 
Honestly, I don’t know. My aunt was still living at that time, and I don’t 
know whether my father—unfortunately, she’s passed on and so is her 
daughter. Her grandson still lives here in Hugo, but I don’t really know 
who designed it. It was put up by Griffin Monument Company, out of 
Ada, Oklahoma, and they have done a lot of the stones there, the 
wonderful wagon wheel and ones that are very unique. But I do know 
that they did take a picture of the archway in front [of this house]. And it 
was done stone by stone, an exact replica of what the archway is. It’s 
still there. My aunt and uncle built this home, and it was built in the mid-
’50s. And for this part of Oklahoma at that time, it was quite a place—
and still is.  
 
I can remember my aunt and uncle didn’t live here very long, because 
my uncle passed away and my aunt just didn’t want to continue living 
here. It’s a large home and her daughter was at the University of 
Oklahoma at that time. She started at OSU. She was in the band at OSU, 
but she actually ended her studies in Oklahoma City, but she did attend 
OU so my aunt moved up to Midwest City to be closer to her and her 
grandson. So she wanted to sell the house and my father bought it from 
her. I moved in here when I was fourteen, and so I’ve lived here ever 
since. But it was quite a house and people used to just pull up and ring 
the doorbell and say, “We’ve heard about this house. Can we look at it?” 
and my father would just bring them in and show them around. We’re 
talking the early-’60s, and it was very trusting at that time. You 
wouldn’t necessarily do it now.  
 
I remember him being very proud of it, and the fact that his brother had 
built it. My uncle did a lot of the woodworking in the shop in the back, 
making the cabinets and the windows and stuff. So I would hear my 
father giving his fifty-cent tour, and I’d be a teenager in my bedroom, 
throwing my clothes in the closet trying to get my room straightened up 
before the people walked in. (Laughter) Our home has been a very 
important part of our life, because we came back here every year. And 
every year we’d come back, we would always have—well, my 
grandfather’s birthday party or a New Year’s party or whatever, and we 
would invite the circus people from the community. It’s always been 
kind of a gathering place. Many, many baby showers and different 
events have taken place here. And we still have the occasional person 
that wants to go through and see it, because it does have some very 
unique aspects.

Well, I think your family is also known for innovations in the circus 
through the years. 
 
Absolutely. 
 
Could you talk a little bit about some of them? 
 
Well, my family started many businesses here in Hugo. They started a 
printing company, and so we would do our own posters and printing of 
our items. We had that for a while. They started a welding shop with 
Wayne Sanguin. My uncle was a very creative guy, and he was a lot of 
the force behind some of the mechanical innovations that took place on 
the circus. Actually, they invented and held patents on several different 
circus paraphernalia. One was called a tent spool, and they named it a 
spool because it basically is like a giant spool of thread, but instead of 
winding thread, it wound the big top. So at night when the boys would 
take the tent down, instead of having to physically hoist it up onto a semi 
or a flatbed, they would unlace it in the middle, and they would fold it, 
fold it, fold it, until it was less than eight feet wide. They would hook it 
onto this spool, and as the truck backed up, this spool would actually 
turn and pull this canvas up on it. It was divided into two parts to 
distribute the weight. And also, the tents were so large it couldn’t go on 
one, it would be top-heavy. They actually perfected that here and 
patented it.  
 
They also were very innovative in developing —you call it a pile 
driver—we call it a stake driver. The posts or rod irons that are in the 
ground, we call them stakes, S-T-A-K-E-S, and they had different 
techniques to drive these. Of course, in the old days, it was arm power. It 
was five or six guys standing around, slinging these sledge hammers to 
put these down, but as the tents got larger and there were more stakes to 
be put in the ground on a daily basis, I think most people think, “Well, 
the circus sets up and you set there for…” No. We move everyday to a 
different town so the stakes had to be driven in the morning and pulled 
up at night. So they developed different systems to drive these stakes 
mounted on either tractors or the back of trucks, and it eased up the 
physical labor a lot.  
 
And as labor got more expensive—back during the ’30s and ’40s you 
could pay somebody a dollar a day and give them a place to sleep and 
food, and they were happy. But as times progressed and minimum wage 
and demands increased, we could afford fewer workers. So now, all the 
stakes—I say all the stakes. That’s not true. We still drive some stakes 
the old fashioned way. Number one, the public loves to watch it, five or 
six guys in coordination, driving these stakes. I still like to watch it, but 
 
 
25

also, for the smaller tents and for areas where you can’t maneuver the 
tractor or the truck we still send the guys out to drive the stakes. But it’s 
much faster and requires a lot less help so they developed the stake 
driver.  
 
We were the first circus in America to carry a giraffe in a truck, and my 
father designed a semi truck that was especially designed for the giraffe. 
We make all our own like, elephant trucks. You don’t just go out to your 
local trailer store and buy an elephant semi. They all have to be specially 
reinforced and designed, air openings in the floor and everything, to haul 
the elephants. They’ve done a lot of innovative things as far as seats, 
seat wagons. In the old days, the seats were put—they were called 
stringers and boards. The stringer was the part that went up and then 
they would have an A-frame thing that held them up, and then the 
boards would fit on them, and they’d tie them on with binding twine. It 
was very time consuming to erect these. And honestly, they weren’t 
quite as safe, probably, as they should’ve been because some of the 
ground’s unlevel, or if there’s mud they would have to put boards under 
them to try to level them up.  
 
And so my father was very involved in developing the modern seat 
wagons that actually fold out. We call one of ours—newer ones—we 
call it a transformer because the kids have the Transformer toys, and so 
it kind of transforms into a vehicle going down the road that hauls 
equipment, poles, ring curbs, different lighting and things. And when it 
gets there, that all gets unloaded and it transforms into this seating 
grandstand. So they were very inventive in that matter. My father was 
way ahead of his time in many things. He was the first one to use 
airplanes as advertising. He had a small single-engine plane that traveled 
in front of the circus. And back in those days, you could do about 
whatever you wanted to in the air so the pilot would fly over the town 
with the loud speaker and circus music and tell about the circus coming 
to town. There’s just many, many examples like that of things that they 
did that were innovative and kind of ahead of their time. 
 
That kind of leads us into how the circus has changed from yesterday to 
today. Maybe we could hit on a couple of those things. I guess today, 
music is probably canned? 
 
It is, I’m sorry to say. That’s one of the true regrets I have, because I 
loved the circus band. They used to hit some awful notes and be out of 
tune, but to me, that was all a part of it. I love the circus band. When we 
first got started—I wasn’t around, but I have memories, even when I 
came, that usually we had an organ and a trumpet and a drum. That was 
all we could afford. But in the very beginning, my aunt was a talented 
musician. My mother leaned more towards performing in the circus, but 
 
 
26
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
my aunt usually supplied the music, and so she always played the organ. 
And we’d usually have a drummer that was keeping beat over there. He 
might not be a real drummer, but somebody could hold some sticks and 
kind of stay with the music, and so my aunt always supplied the music.  
 
I think music is very important to a circus. And proof of that, I think, 
would be the modern example of the Cirque du Soleil because they 
have—don’t get me wrong, they have wonderful artists—but the 
majority of their appeal is their smoke and mirrors and their music, the 
illusion. Some of the acts came straight from Carson and Barnes or 
straight from other circuses so it’s how it’s presented. I think music and 
the staging is very important. And I love those old-timey bands. We, at 
one time, had an eleven-piece band, and we would have the organ, the 
drums, a couple of trombones, trumpets, a bass, and it was really an 
oom-pah-pah-type thing. And, like you imagine, the ta-da at the end of 
the act and everything. We were one of the last ones to go to it [taped 
music]. We held on until the very end. But, again, it’s hard to find 
musicians that want to travel on our schedule.  
 
We get tickled when we hear the rock people and the country people 
say, “Oh, we’re doing fifteen spots over three months,” or whatever. 
They’re just all this talk—we show in a different town every day, two to 
three shows a day for eight and a half months. So I don’t accept their 
belly-aching when they are traveling in these multi-million dollar buses, 
and they arrive and it’s all set up. But it’s hard to get musicians that 
want to live under those circumstances. Also, the union had an effect on 
bands, circus bands. We never really had that direct problem but other 
circuses did. Ringling Brothers, I know did, that if the performance ran 
over the allotted time, they weren’t allowed to keep playing. Well, you 
never know how long a circus performance—if the lion or tiger doesn’t 
want to go back into the chute, it may last five minutes longer or if, God 
forbid, somebody falls. There’s a number of things that can happen. 
Circus isn’t like a movie where it starts at an exact second and ends an 
exact second.  
 
There were a lot of things that made circuses have to change to the 
canned music, but we try to have the very best can music we can. 
(Laughs) We have a gentleman in circus business, we’re very lucky to 
be connected with a man, who composes the music for us. So therefore, 
he can take a modern piece, tweak it, and make it adaptable for the 
circus. We’re lucky to have him around in these days, and a lot of 
circuses depend on him to write their music. Of course, some people pay 
and use the original music. I love music and, of course, I love music 
that’s done by the wonderful singers and whatever, but I think there’s 
something that isn’t quite right about hearing Mariah Carey or someone 
sing in the circus. I think it really needs to be adapted to have that circus

feel so that’s what we try and do. 
 
How has the performers changed through the years? 
 
Well, I think of all the changes in the circus business, that’s probably the 
least thing that has changed. Performing is—circus is an art, and I think 
a lot of times, especially in the United States—in Europe and South 
America, circus performers get a lot more respect and have a lot more 
admiration than they do in the United States. In some places they’re 
treated like movie stars if they’re at the top of their game. And it used to 
be that in Russia and China the very best athletes were chosen for the 
circus school. I think in different parts of the country maybe circus 
performers are viewed a little more different. But I tell you, I think that’s 
turning around a little bit, because of these shows on television. If you’ll 
notice—what’s, America Has Talent? [America’s Got Talent] 
 
Yes. 
 
A circus act, I don’t believe, hasn’t won it yet, but if you watch that 
show and you watch the reaction to the circus acts, they get as much 
applause, or in some cases, more applause than the singers or the 
comedians or the dancers. So that’s kind of neat for me to see, that a true 
circus act is getting that kind of appreciation. The people that do that 
show, or the people that watch that show, might not realize they’re 
watching a pure circus act, but they are. Performers are usually multi-
generational. Some performers do get into it. On that particular show, 
there was a girl who said she fell in love with the man on the flying 
trapeze, and so she decided she was going to learn this act, and she was 
marvelous. She had to have had some gymnastic background. But 
usually performers are raised in the circus and are multi-generational. 
It’s a gift that is passed on from one generation to the other. I think of all 
the things that have changed and modernized in the circus world, 
probably, that aspect of it has least changed.  
 
When you get ready to plan your next season, do you already know who 
you want? 
 
As a performer? 
 
As a performer. 
 
Yes, well, we try to change our performance drastically every couple of 
years. A lot of the communities we go back to are repeated every couple 
of years so we want to have something new and fresh for the audience. 
And we may keep the same people, but we may ask them to learn a new 
routine or to change it in such a manner that it’s not recognizable. Some

of our performers have been with us for many years, but they have 
evolved into different acts so that the public wouldn’t realize it’s the 
same person. But we do, I mean, we know now who’ll be with us next 
year. But there are always unforeseen things.  We had a young man fall 
last year, and he was injured quite severely. He’s recovering and will 
recover, but it’s possible that he won’t be ready for the start of the 
season.  
 
It’s kind of, I guess, like a football team. You have injuries or 
pregnancies or marriage breakups. It’s living life on the road in the 
center ring, but there’s still all the problems of living life that go along 
with it. You’re not immune to any of the problems that you would have 
in Stillwater or wherever you live. I mean, you still have illnesses and 
problems, but you know what I’m trying to say. Life goes on, even 
underneath a tent so we have to adapt for those circumstances. We had 
an accident this year. The third day out a high-wire troupe was rear-
ended by a truck through no fault of their own. Completely demolished 
their living compartment and their rigging for their act so they had to 
hurry and scramble and go and try to get it. We were without them for a 
little while, but they eventually came back. You have to keep adapting to 
every day what comes up before you.  
 
It’s probably a little more complicated than the average person would 
imagine.  It’s not just a circus, it’s many different types of businesses put 
together. It’s a trucking business, it’s an animal business, it’s 
entertainment, it’s concessions business. We feed our people. We have a 
truck that all it does is prepare meals so they get two full meals a day. 
Everyone on the circus that wants to go there and eat can go there and 
eat. Then they have coffee and rolls in the morning before they leave. 
Say we’re in Hugo setting up, and we’re going to Paris, we would get up 
at five-thirty, they would have their coffee and rolls, they would get their 
little route slip that tells them “Highway 271,” and whatever, and they 
would go to the next town. At eleven-thirty they would have lunch, but it 
would be in the next town. And that cookhouse will go and prepare a 
meal and be ready to serve it by eleven-thirty. So they’ll take a break 
from whatever they’re doing, and they’ll have the night meal and that’s 
usually the larger meal.  
 
A lot of the performers won’t eat that meal, because it’s in the middle of 
the performance. So they’ll get take-home trays, take them home, and 
then after the show they’ll eat the meal. So it’s many different—it’s a 
costuming company. It’s so many things put together. We have someone 
that handles the logbooks, and we have to do DOT [Department of 
Transportation] and IFTA [International Fuel Tax Association]. You 
have to get those—every day we purchased two thousand dollars, last 
year, worth of fuel to pump into our generators and our trucks. All that

has to be taken care of on a daily basis. We have a mechanical crew that 
travels along with us. They follow up with the wrecker and the tires and 
everything. We don’t call a local guy to come and fix our tire. We fix 
our tire ourselves and move on to the next town. So it’s quite an amazing 
operation, it really is. It’s a big umbrella or big, big top. Everyone that 
travels with the circus is not wearing that spangled costume in the center 
ring, but they’re just as important as that performer in that center ring. 
Their job is just as valuable. 
 
How do you keep everything straight? 
 
Oh! (Laughs) Sometimes we don’t, but it’s, like I said, if you come and 
see us set up, you won’t hear anyone hollering instructions or screaming. 
It’s very departmentalized. There is a head mechanic, there is a head 
electrician. We have one man that all he does is secure water all day. We 
have a truck with a huge tank on it, our local host, the rotary or the 
chamber or whoever, arranges for us to have a water source. He goes 
and fills his tank, he delivers water to the animals first, the elephants, the 
ponies. Everything gets watered. He goes back, he gets another load, he 
comes and brings it for the cookhouse, the concession department. He 
goes and fills it, then he fills the sleepers with water. So that’s his job all 
day, is to procure water so nobody has to tell him.  
 
We have a man called a twenty-four hour man that goes ahead of us and 
meets with the local hosts, looks over the grounds, sees where the tent’s 
going to be, finds out where the water is. So he meets that man when he 
gets to the next lot at seven or eight in the morning. He leads him to the 
water source so he knows where to get his water, and that’s his job all 
day. The cooks know that they have to prepare these meals. We have 
one person that goes and buys local produce and fresh meat and 
everything every day. That twenty-four hour man, a day ahead, 
schedules hay to be delivered for the animals. It’s very organized. It’s 
very departmentalized. When the tent is going up, there’s a big top crew, 
there’s an electrical crew, there’s —we call them butchers. They’re 
vendors that sell the popcorn and stuff during the performance, but they 
help put the tent up too so they have their job, they have their seats to 
erect. It’s very, very organized.  
 
And not that things don’t go wrong, they do, but we have good bosses, 
we have good people, and so that part of it usually—it’s usually outside 
forces that throw wrenches into our gears. It’s usually mother nature or 
the local health inspector decides that he wants something different than 
the last one hundred towns we’ve been in. Everybody has their own little 
pet-thing. Maybe this day the electrical inspector thinks we need to bury 
all the cables instead of just laying a rubber matting over the cables. So 
you never know what to expect every day, but mostly it’s not within, but

it’s the outside sources that usually slow us down. (Laughs) 
 
When the show’s going on, where are you? 
 
It depends. Hopefully, I’m in the office counting money. (Laughter) But 
not always. I still consider myself a jack-of-all-trades. I will sell tickets, 
I’ll take tickets. I’ll direct the people. My husband will be out there 
parking cars, if needed. If I see that they need me in the tent, I’ll go in 
there and help sit people. If the line at the concession stand’s too long, 
I’ll jump in and make snow cones. My father watched every 
performance. He was very famous because he had his folding chair, he 
would carry it in, he would sit by the back door, and he would watch 
every performance. I don’t do that for several reasons. One, I’m very 
critical, and I’m very picky.  
 
If I watch it too many times, I start being too critical, because I don’t see 
it as the audience sees it. I see it as somebody that’s sitting there seeing 
it every day and maybe critiquing something that really doesn’t make 
any difference, if that makes any sense. A lot of people wonder why I 
don’t sit there every day, but honestly, that’s the main reason. I think I 
get too critical. And if this person’s shoes are a different color than this 
person’s shoes in the same act—or that the public wouldn’t—I want it to 
be good, and I want the acts to be completed properly, and I want the 
wardrobe to look nice, and I want all of that. And it is, but I just feel that 
if I watch it every day, every show, that I might become overcritical so I 
don’t watch it. I like to walk in and it to be fresh, and I really enjoy 
watching it, if that makes any sense. (Laughs) 
 
So you may watch the first one of the season and the last one of the 
season? 
 
Well, I watch a few more than that. And I kind of watch at the end of the 
seats sometimes, when they don’t even know I’m in there, because I 
want to be sure that what I see when I’m sitting in the front row is not 
something different than the average person that comes to see it would 
see if I’m not sitting in there. So I kind of surprise them and drift in and 
out and don’t get in too much of a routine. But I also do a lot of the 
paperwork. Everybody in our family is responsible for different aspects 
of it, and I have the unpleasant task of inputting the bills. (Laughs) But 
that gives me a chance to see who’s spending what and whether this guy 
stopped at a gas station that the gas was $3.98 a gallon and the other guy 
stopped where it was $3.68 a gallon and I’ll ask that guy, “Why didn’t 
you look for the $3.68 a gallon gas?” It gives you a chance to see how 
the money is being spent. So that’s my job.  
 
Traci, our oldest daughter, is in charge of all the immigration papers.

She does all the immigration for the people that come from a variety of 
countries all over the world to work with us. She and her husband also 
are in charge of the concessions, and then her husband oversees and 
designs the lighting and is kind of responsible for hiring all the acts. He 
comes from a circus family, and he has a lot of contacts, and so he does 
that. Our other daughter [Kristin] is in charge of all the animal permits, 
which is very complicated. Sometimes each city, each state, has to have 
different documentation for the animals. And she also meets with our 
local host every day, the Kiwanis or the chamber, and she settles up 
ticket sales and that part of it. Our other son-in-law is more in charge of 
erecting the big top, and he likes animals. He doesn’t really work with 
the animals, but he observes and checks on them. So they all have their 
own expertise and their own jobs, that way we try not to step on 
anybody’s toes. (Laughs) So it takes everyone.  
 
There are people that are single owners of circuses that don’t have 
family working with them. And, to me, it would not be a fun thing. I 
really enjoy our family being together and working towards one goal. 
My grandchildren have jobs. My granddaughter rides a little pony in the 
parade like I used to do when I was five. And my one grandson is our 
office gofer, he gets change and tickets and changes seats and runs for 
us. And then my other grandson—kind of interested in performing, but 
this year he worked in the concessions. He worked one of the windows, 
waited on the public. They’re ten years old, will be eleven soon, and so 
they learn at a young age to work and have responsibilities.  
 
I’m not bragging because anything is possible, but we don’t have a drug 
problem or anything like that on our show because they’re busy, they’re 
working, they’re occupied. We have a school that travels along with us, 
and we have a teacher that is usually a retired teacher and has never been 
on a circus, but they like to travel. The one we had last year was 
wonderful. We had fifteen students in our school, and they go to school 
every day. He had four different classes, and they go Monday through 
Friday, all the way through the summer. And then we take them to state 
parks and national parks and museums and things along the way so they 
get exposed to all kinds of things. 
 
We have a young lady that travels with us that was a roommate of my 
daughter’s at TCU, and she graduated and she kind of liked the circus so 
we said, “Come travel with us, just for a summer.” She’d never traveled 
much, and so she did. And that was seven years ago, I think, and she is 
our office manager, but she really works with the children. She works 
with them on the weekends. They have little productions they do. They 
had a beautiful ceremony on 9-11. We have one young lady that’s about 
fifteen, she has a beautiful singing voice, and she sang “God Bless 
America,” and a couple of songs. And they recited poetry, and it was

wonderful. All the circus people attended. We have Easter egg hunts. 
We have all kinds of things for kids during the year. We have a weenie 
roast at the Fourth of July. It’s great, it really is. 
 
Just a big family. 
 
Yes, it’s kind of like, I guess, you imagine in the old days in the cities 
where there are blocks, have block parties, and the blocks kind of have 
personalities. Well, it’s a true melting pot because we have people from 
all over the world, and we seem to live together and function well, even 
though sometimes the language is a problem, because there might be 
five or six different languages spoken on the circus grounds. And the 
food tastes aren’t always the same, but at least once a year, sometimes 
more, we have potluck where everyone will bring different foods from 
their countries, and we all share in the big top and have potluck dinners. 
So that’s something fun we do, too. But it’s extremely hard work, and 
you have to love the circus and love what you do or you couldn’t do it. It 
takes too much out of you physically, emotionally, to do this day after 
day if you really didn’t love what you are doing. And that goes down to 
the working man that’s driving that stake in the ground or the guy on the 
flying trapeze that’s completing the triple. They really have to like what 
they’re doing. 
 
Do you have a favorite part, yourself? 
 
As far as the performance? 
 
Yes. 
 
The elephants, yes, yes. There are several different acts that I really 
enjoy, and we have a wonderful flyer, and he’s really a joy to watch. 
He’s really good. We have a young man that has been here. He’s 
eighteen now. He came when he was fifteen, fourteen or fifteen, and 
he’s a contortionist. More than watching him, I love the reaction of the 
audience when he does his act. I love to see the young performers that 
really have practiced. I’ve seen them practice in between shows and 
before and after, and then when they get to debut that act in the ring, I 
really enjoy watching them. But I guess I’ve inherited that true love for 
the elephants. They’re the most magnificent animals on earth, and I just 
really like being around them, seeing them. 
 
Do you have a favorite venue or town? 
 
As far as the…? 
 
Stops, what’s your favorite town?

Byrd 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Oh, stops. Yes, historically there’ve been some that we’ve developed 
over the years that we really look forward to going back to, one of them 
is Sheboygan, Wisconsin. We always play right on the lake, and 
Sheboygan has a circus history. My mother and father, the first circus 
my mother ever worked for was called Seils-Sterling Circus, and it was a 
family out of Sheboygan, Wisconsin that had that, the Lindemann 
family. A lot of them still live there and are retired, and so they always 
come and see us, and we have brats, and we have a polka band. I guess 
my favorite venues maybe don’t have anything to do with the circus, but 
rather the location and the camaraderie of different places around the 
country where we set up, Jacksonville, Illinois is one.  
 
A lot of it depends on the people that are in the community, rather, I 
guess, than the location. Sometimes we’re down around Houston, we’ll 
set up on the Gulf and here my RV is parked with a perfect view of the 
Gulf, and I think, “Wow! It’d cost me several million dollars to have a 
condo here,” and so those venues are always nice. But I like to set up in 
Kansas on the farmland. It all depends on the response of the community 
and whether you feel like you’re wanted and appreciated. If people come 
out in the morning and watch the tent go up or maybe they’ll bring 
school buses of children out to see the animals and see the activities, 
that’s what makes you—I know it sounds really corny, but that is what 
makes you feel like what you’re doing is worthwhile. When you feel like 
you’re coming into a community that wants you to be there, that 
appreciates you, and you bring joy and fun into their lives, that maybe 
they wouldn’t have if you hadn’t have brought the circus to town that 
day. So I think wherever that happens, that’s my favorite venue. 
 
How do you decide your route every year? 
 
Well, we cover a lot of the United States. Maine and New Hampshire 
and Vermont, besides Alaska and Hawaii, I think, are the only three 
states that we haven’t ever set up in. So we try to vary it. We went west 
last year. This year we’ll probably stay in the midwest, which is my 
favorite. Then we might go east. We vary it from year to year because 
we go to smaller communities. I mean, we play Chicago, we play Fort 
Worth, we play Dallas, but I probably prefer being in Shawnee or 
Okmulgee or Elk City, rather than Oklahoma City or Tulsa, just because 
we like to be the big fish in the pond. Those cities are inundated with 
entertainment. They can pick to do something every night of the week if 
they wanted. But if we pull into Chickasha, it might be a big deal. So 
Chickasha we wouldn’t go back to every year. We might give it a year to 
rest. Tulsa, we might go back to every year. So we will vary the route to 
let it rest and hope that another circus doesn’t come in in the year we’re 
letting it rest to go back to, just so that it’ll be fresh, and they won’t say,

“Well, we just went to a circus last year,” which it might’ve been two or 
three years ago. So we try to let them rest in between, the smaller towns. 
 
And how big of a lot do you need to set up in? 
 
Well, it’s changed during the years. It used to be a lot bigger than it is, 
and I’m amazed now, at some of the places my son-in-laws can get this 
set up. We’ll pull into a grounds and I’ll look and I’ll say, “There’s no 
way that we’re going to get this on.” But it was funny, we set up on a 
mall this year and they had trees on it. We actually had a tree sticking 
right up through the tent. They had to lay it out where it laced around 
this tree for us to be able to set up on. So it has gotten smaller, but we 
need at least somewhere around four hundred by four hundred feet, not 
counting parking. We set up in so many different types of venues. 
We’ve been on soccer fields, we were on a golf course—which I don’t 
recommend that because it might rain—we’ve been in Farmer John’s 
pasture, where you’re stepping over the cow patties, we’ve been on 
deserts, we show on military bases, we’ve been at universities, parks, 
you name it. We’ve set up malls, strip malls. We’ve been on just about 
every kind of land you can imagine. Some of them not suited for circus, 
but somehow we made it work. 
 
And you also play indoors some? 
 
Some. It’s not our forte. Our favorite saying is, ‘If you don’t have a tent 
and you don’t have an elephant, you don’t have a circus.’ But we do 
break away from our traditional love every once in a while and set up in 
a building. We set up in Tulsa every year at the fairgrounds. American 
Airlines bring us in as a Christmas party for their employees. And we 
also do a Fort Worth ten-day stand in Will Rogers Coliseum for the 
Shriners. And we did a thing in Guthrie, out at Gaylord’s Horse 
Pavilion. So every once in a while we will, but it’s not our preference 
and it’s not our love. 
 
Well, the circus business, it’s hard work, and it’s definitely changed 
through the years. 
 
Yes. 
 
What are some of your current challenges as an owner? 
 
Well, getting people to want to spend their scarce dollar for 
entertainment. That’s the largest challenge that we have to overcome, 
currently, is the economy. I think we’re kind of like the canary in the 
mine. I think it kind of hits us, and we see it coming, maybe, before the 
average business. People still have to eat, they still have to wear clothes,

they still have to do whatever, buy food, but they don’t have to go to the 
circus. So this problem in our economy has really hit us. That’s our big 
challenge is to get people excited enough before we get to town to think 
that this is something they want to spend their hard-earned money on. 
Once we get them there, they love it and we have a wonderful response. 
We’ve got a great product, and we’re very proud of it. Sometimes, just if 
I’m down, just to make myself feel better, I’ll go stand at the gate as the 
show’s over and take in the compliments of, “Thank you for coming to 
town,” and, “It was a great show,” and, “Come back.” It makes you feel 
good. But you’ve got to get them there, and right now that’s our most 
difficult challenge. 
 
How has government regulations impacted the business? 
 
Oh, it’s impacted it tremendously. It’s because, like I said earlier, it’s 
such a business of varied businesses. It’s not just that if you are a 
rancher you have to deal with the USDA [United States Department of 
Agriculture] or whatever. Or if you’re a restaurant you have to deal with 
the health inspector. We deal with all those entities. Right now, 
immigration is very difficult. We can bring people in as performers, 
which is different than bringing in laborers, but we also bring in H-2B 
laborers. And believe me, everyone that works for us is legal and they 
have Visas, because we go everywhere in the United States. We’re 
upright and above board, and we don’t hire any illegals. But it gets more 
difficult each year to bring those workers in, because of the climate in 
the United States now where people think that all these people are 
coming in and taking our jobs. If we were honest, they’re doing jobs that 
nobody else would want to do, and they are a caliber of people as a 
whole, I don’t want to judge people as groups—but as a whole, the 
caliber of people that we can hire to do this job from foreign countries 
are a higher caliber person that we could hire from the United States to 
do the same job.  
 
So any barriers that are put up for us bringing people up legally because 
of the reaction to the ones that are coming illegally, that makes it harder 
on us. Just every community is having financial problems now, so 
therefore, every community is trying to raise money rather than taxing 
their constituents. So all these new permits have blossomed over the last 
few years. A permit for everything you can imagine, we have to have. 
Where it used to be twenty-five or fifty dollars for a business license, 
now it’s five hundred dollars for a business license. So it’s kind of like a 
domino effect. The economy effects the local communities, which put 
on more rules and regulations, which effect the businesses. And, 
basically, we’re a business, and so anything that comes along down the 
pike like that effects us. I mean, it’s just things like that that have 
changed over the last years.

Where do you see the future of the circus, in general, going? Do you 
think we’ll always have a circus? 
 
Well, I’ve been asked that before, and I believe there will be. It may not 
be in the same form as it is today. When my parents started, I’m so 
grateful that my father lived in the time he did because for him to be a 
real circus guy, a real showman in that genre, he lived at the perfect 
time. When they came to town, they didn’t have TV, they had limited 
radio, no internet of course, or anything like that. This was the 
entertainment coming to town. They would let school out. I mean, kids 
would come from all over. I have eight-millimeter movies of the crowds 
coming. They had their white gloves on, the gentlemen had their hats, 
their white coats, and their ties. I mean, this was an event. They would 
sometimes bring picnic lunches and spread their blankets out, and they 
would be there all day. And that’s changed.  
 
We are lucky to get them there. Hopefully we can get them to come in 
the morning, like I talked about, but that doesn’t happen every day. And 
hopefully, we can get them to come and spend a couple of hours with us 
before the show. But it used to be an event so my father lived in the best 
possible time to be a circus owner and a showman. I think the challenge 
nowadays is to get the kids away from the computers and all that and to 
get them to the circus. Because once we get them there, they have a 
great time. They enjoy it. And even teenagers, who really think it’s 
beyond them, if we can get them there, they have fun.  
 
We had a friend of ours that was a retired superintendant of schools, and 
he traveled with us for, oh, seven or eight years and did marketing and 
publicity. He also traveled on the show with us. And we set up in this 
town just this fall where his godchild was going to the university. She 
was majoring in journalism so she took that opportunity to come out and 
do a little story on the circus and talk to me. So I invited her back and I 
said, “Get some of your friends. Bring them back tonight. We’ll treat 
you.” I didn’t think she would. She showed up at the night show, and she 
had five or six of her college friends that she had just met, because the 
school had just started, and she’s a freshman. But she talked them into 
coming to the circus and they rode the elephant, they had their face 
painted, they saw the show. I got thank you letters like you wouldn’t 
believe. They just went on and on, what a wonderful time they had. And 
I bet if I had told them or talked to them the day before the circus came 
to town, they would’ve had no interest at all of going to the circus. But 
because she came and had a connection and talked them into coming, 
and it was free for college kids because I treated them, they had a 
wonderful time. So those are the challenges that we face and making the 
circus relevant in today’s society.

Where do you see the future of Carson and Barnes going? 
 
We’re holding on. We’re holding on. And my children love it. I can’t 
plan my grandchildren’s lives, and some of them may end up in the 
circus, and if that’s what they want—but we would never push them 
towards it. All of my grandchildren will go to college, whether they 
want to or not, and then they can make that choice of whether they want 
to continue or whether they want to go in a different field. And I can’t 
predict what that will be, they’re only ten, seven, five, and one week old. 
I have five, four boys and a girl. But if that’s what they want to do, then 
hopefully Carson and Barnes will still be there for them to want to 
continue on with. And my husband and I and our daughters and our son-
in-laws are doing the very best we can to see that that happens, but it’s 
very challenging, very challenging. 
 
Well, you can call any place home, yet here you are in Hugo, Oklahoma. 
 
Yes, Hugo, Oklahoma. (Laughs) 
 
You’ve seen all parts of the US, why do you decide to continue to call 
Hugo your home? 
 
Well, this is our home. I mean, this is where we feel comfortable. We 
love Oklahoma. We feel we’re good ambassadors for the state of 
Oklahoma and for Choctaw County and Hugo, because in every 
performance, in every town we’re in, our elephants are introduced as 
being either from the Endangered Ark Foundation or the Carson Ranch 
in Hugo, Oklahoma. So everywhere we go, people know we’re from 
Oklahoma, and we’re proud to be from here. And we feel welcome here. 
We feel part of the community. David Rawls was our partner for many 
years. He had seven brothers and sisters. I’ve seen them grow from 
children into adults, and he is the only one that really has stayed in the 
business. He’s been our mayor, he’s been our city manager. I mean, 
circus is an integral part of Hugo.  
 
And I’ll have to be honest with you, one time, back in the—let’s see. I 
was in high school. It was in the ’60s. My father bought property on the 
Gulf Coast, in between Biloxi and Gulfport, and he had every intention 
of moving the winter quarters to there and trying to make it a year 
around business, because it’s very hard to travel. Expenses are so much 
that it’s very difficult to come home with enough money to see 
everybody through the four, four and a half months. I mean, hay is now 
eighty dollars a round bale. A couple years ago we paid $120 dollars a 
round bale for the hay, and with cold winter like last year, the elephant 
barns are heated by natural gas. We spent seventeen thousand dollars a

Nykolaiszyn 
 
 
 
Byrd 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
month on one barn. It’s one hundred dollars a day just to open one of 
those shops just to keep it heated during the winter. And it was very 
appealing, the thought of going to the Gulf Coast and having a 
permanent park there that would continue to stay open during the 
summer while we were gone, and then we would be able to have tourists 
and people come in the winter times, and it would be continual revenue.  
 
He did very seriously consider it, and he did take some stuff down there. 
We didn’t physically go. We stayed in our home. I was in school and 
they didn’t want to uproot me and take me to a different place, and so 
we had people down there. But it didn’t pan out. I’m glad it didn’t, but it 
didn’t pan out, and I think half the property is probably washed off by 
hurricanes by now. But it was a good idea, and I could see why he 
thought of it, but we didn’t move, and I’m glad. I unfortunately lost my 
purse, and why I was carrying this in my purse I have no idea, but back 
when telegrams were still a way to communicate long-distance, the city 
of Hugo actually sent us a telegram telling us how important we were to 
the community and that they really wished that we would not leave. That 
means a lot to you. So we’re here, and we’re glad we’re here. Hugo’s 
evolved just like the circus business has evolved, some for the better, 
some for the worse, but it’s home.  
 
As we get ready to close out our interview, any wisdom or lessons that 
your parents passed down to you that just really resonate with you 
today? 
 
Well, they were hard working people, and they loved what they did. And 
I think that that is a very important lesson for young people to learn, that 
there are things of value that you may not even realize that you’re 
learning as you’re growing up with your parents. I think they instilled in 
me the love of the circus and hard work and trying to take care of your 
employees and making it feel like a family. When you’re the owner of a 
circus, you end up being their banker, their minister, their psychologist, 
their—you become everything to them. So it is like a big family. And I 
think they instilled that feeling in me as an adult or a child, and I hope 
I’ve continued to do that to the people that we’ve worked with today.  
 
But they were just good people, and they tried to give people good value 
for their dollar, and they appreciated that people worked hard to earn 
that money to come to the circus. And they didn’t want anybody leaving 
without having a good time and without feeling that they—we don’t 
please everyone. You can’t please everyone, but I’d say we give it the 
best try we can. And I see that in my girls, too. If a little kid trips and 
spills his snow cone, they go get his cone and they put another snow 
cone in it. They don’t wait and let their momma buy another one. Or if 
the little kid’s balloon bursts, then you go get them another balloon. As

far as the circus world, that’s what they instilled in me and what they 
instilled in my children and I’ve tried to instill in my children, that what 
we do is—it’s good, and it’s worthwhile, and it’s not just for the money. 
I mean, we do have to make money. It’s how we make our living, but 
it’s not about the money. It’s about the tradition of the circus and putting 
on a quality show and giving people a good bang for their buck. I don’t 
know if that’s what you had in mind, but that’s what came to my mind 
when you asked that question. 
 
Well, do you have anything else you’d like to add that we may not have 
asked you about today? 
 
Well, I have stories about my family and my upbringing. Everyone says, 
“You should write a book,” and I don’t know whether it’d have to be 
under fiction or fact because there are so many things that have 
happened to us and to them. Their stories seem to be more fascinating to 
me than mine do to me because mine seem normal, but they have stories. 
My father bought a ship one time, and he had a vision of going up the 
coast and performing in different towns and being in a ship. So my 
mother and I were there, and we bought a ship, and we had a little 
airplane. We flew up to Nova Scotia and waited for the ship to come 
from Florida. It kept breaking down. They finally got there, and we had 
our show. The ship catches on fire, and it sinks, and we have to get the 
animals off. It’s just like a movie, and there’s just so many stories like 
that.  
 
When they moved to Mena, Arkansas, they didn’t have anything. My 
mom and dad used to get twenty-five cents a week. That’s what they got 
to spend. Everything went back to the circus so my mother would buy a 
candy bar, and my father would buy a cigar. And they built this house 
out of green lumber and they left, and when they came back it had all 
shriveled up, and so they had to pack dirt and rags into the—I mean, 
there’s just stories. I could go on forever. When they’d been in show 
business fifty years, we bought my parents a beautiful, nice motor home, 
and so they stood up, and they were saying how grateful they were and 
everything. So my mother stood up and she says, “This is beautiful. 
Thank you all.” She said, “When your father and I got married”—she 
was talking to me—“we didn’t have a pot to pee in.” And she said, 
“Here fifty years later, I’ve got one that holds thirty-five gallons.” 
(Laughter) And that was her sense of humor. There’s just so many 
stories we’d be here for days. So we can wrap it up with that, I guess. 
(Laughter) 
 
When we look back on circus history, your family, not only in Oklahoma, 
it’s just something that will always be remembered.

I hope so. I hope so. I hope we’ve been an asset to the circus business. I 
hope we’ve had a positive influence on the circus world. And I believe 
we have. I’m very, very proud that we just completed our seventy-fifth 
tour, seventy-five years of doing this all over the United States. And 
that, actually, there’s never been a family in the United States that has 
continuously owned a circus in the United States for that length of time, 
for seventy-five years. They’ve done it in Europe a lot, but here in the 
United States—I mean, Ringling Brothers has been in business longer 
than we have, but they’ve been owned by a variety of entities, Mattel 
Toy Company, Ringling Brothers, the Feld Family. I’m very proud of 
the fact that we’ve been doing this continually for seventy-five years. 
 
Well, we appreciate you talking with us and spending some time with us 
and giving us just a little glimpse into your life as a circus owner and the 
contributions your family has made. Thank you so much. 
 
Well, you’re quite welcome.
