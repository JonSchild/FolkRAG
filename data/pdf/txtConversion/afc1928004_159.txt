THE KISS BEHIND THE DOOR ) 
Or, Where's Rosanna Gone? 
As sung by GEORGE HARRIS. 
0 
ONCE I 
was as gay 
As a 
jolly young cock sparrow, 
Who's perch'd upon an apple tree, 
Or down amongst the corn. 
But now clean through my heart 
You could drive a 
large wheel-barrow, 
For my love has left a 
bole it it, 
0 
where's Rosanna gone. 
CHORUS. 
I 
shall neyer kiss my love again behind the kitchen door, 
I 
shall never squeedge my darling's little anger any more. 
And she'll ne'er pinch my funny-bone until it's rather sore, 
Oh! where's Rosanna gone. 
I'm sure no other maid 
Could equal my Rosanna, 
Without my love this manly form 
Will soon become a 
wreck; 
Of her Dad I 
was afraid, 
lie's a 
d 
is agreabl e 
tanner, 
And he's often promised faithfully 
Ile'd dislocate my neck. 
I 
shall never kiss my love, cte. 
in an evening after tea, 
While her Daddy blew his ' bum', 
I'd seek my love Rosanna, and 
Ask her to share my lot. 
But when he found it out, 
Oh my! how he would whack her, 
While I'd jump over the garden wall, 
As tho' I'd just been shot. 
I 
shall never kiss my love, &c. 
I'd jumped over the wall one night, 
In search of sweet Rosanna, 
And tho' I 
gently whistled, 
My love did not appear; 
But my hair stood bolt upright, 
For out came her dad, the tanner, 
Oh I 
my teeth they rattled like dominoes, 
And my legs doubled up with fear. 
I 
should never see my love, dm 
• 
Some say she's hid away, 
By her cruel Dad on purpose, 
To cure her of her love for me. 
Some say my love s 
no more. 
If she's defunct, then soon 
Shall they find my gray cold corpus, 
And our ghosts shall come and frighten her Dad 
Behind the kitchen door. 
I 
shall never kiss my love, &
c.

SPEAK OUT LIKE A MAN. 
Sung with the greatest success by J
ENNIE ENGEL. 
THOUGH you gentlemen are smiing, 
It's very plain to me, , 
But most of you are single, 
Which of course ought not to be, 
There's girls I'm sure in plenty, 
Who would yOur happiness advance, 
By wedding you to morrow 
If they only had a 
chance. 
CHORUS. 
filen don't be shy, for single life's a 
sin, 
Fair laly, as the proverb says, 
saint heart did never win. 
Then don't be shy, but do the best you can: 
And when you go a 
courting 
Why, speak out like a 
man. 
When at your kind attentions, 
We appear to take offense' 
Pray don't be disconcerted 
Thai's merely a 
pretence. 
If to wring your, ears we threaten, 
We, of course, mean no such thing, 
It's merely a 
suggestion, 
We ourselves should like a 
ring. 
Then don't be shy, &c. 
Now you gentlemen attention. 
If you'd happy be for life,, 
Don't live in single wretchedness, 
But quickly take a 
wife. 
There's a 
funny man sitting there, 
Like one upon the shelf, 
To set you an example. 
I'll make love to him myself. 
Then don't be shy, ite.

DOLLY DOT. \ 
As sung by M ISS JENNIE ENGEL. 
FM told that once there lived a 
maid, 
Whose name was Dolly Dot, 
And while her Pa soled boots and shoes, 
She sold potatoes hot; 
He never stirred from out his stall, 
But Dolly had to roam, 
For she -
I•epaired to Madison Square 
While he repaired at home. 
CHOU'S. 
Dolly Dot was handsome, Dolly Dot was fair, 
Dolly Dot potatoes hot sold in Madison Square; 
Oh: Dolly Dot was charming, Dolly Dot was gay 
And just the sort of a 
girl to steal a 
fellow's heart away 
Now as she earned her daily bread 
'us said that it Mel, 
She won the heart of one who came 
His daily bread to sell; 
So gay was he that in his coat 
A 
flour was , lways found, 
And he went round the Square because 
The'Square was in his round. 
Doily Dot, cie. 
ut Dolly hatia black amour 
A 
chit:rine" sweep so cute, 
ztod as she!Aped the black-a-moor, 
She, looked apon his soot; 
An ali pert ling tongue had he 
And was seeh an adept, 
That all h cr,A was chimneys weep 
And theu du chimneys wept. 
Dolly Dot, &c. 
These two het,
-)es were bosom friends 
Until it caD,e about, 
That they fell in with Dolly Dot 
And then ney both fell out; 
Beside poor Dolly's can they met 
For her fair hand to tight, 
knd soon they had the matter up 
And down in black and white. 
Dolly Dot, &c. 
The baker soon began to tire, 
For dough is tender stuff, 
And when they'd a 
bout or two 
He'd aad about enough; 
The lucky chimney sweep thus proved 
His right to Dolly's charms, 
And soon his sweetheart flew unto 
Her love's victorious arms. 
Doily Dot, Etc.

IN THE BOWERY, 
TONT PASTOR'S Great Sensational Song. 
Ain—" Piccadilly." 
[This song has been called for nightly for months in succession, hav-
ing been sung by Mr. PASTOR in his own inimitable style, and been 
received with thunders of applause. 
SOME say that Central Park's the place, 
For fun of every kini,l; 
On Broadway and Fifth Avenue 
Much pleasure others find. 
But I'm a 
different sort of chap 
No fun in that I 
see, 
For when I 
want enjoyment 
The Bowery for me. 
SPOKEN.— Yes, you may talk about your Broadway belles, 
your Fifth Avenue swells, your exquisitely-dressed creatures, 
with their lavender kids, and their la-de-da's, now, what do 
they know about enjoyment? They are afraid to go in for a 
little fun for fear of disarranging their toilets: and then what 
would Mrs. Grundy say? " Charles Frelerick Augustus is get-
ting decidedly vulgar; Seraphina Emelia is positively shock-
ing!" 
But here in the Bowery people enjoy themselves just 
when they feel like it. 
They don't care a 
curse what others may 
say, for that's the custom. 
CIIORUS. 
In the Bowery, in the Bowery, 
For beautiful girls with bright eyes and dark curls, 
In the Bowery, in the Bowery, 
That's where I 
reside when I'm home. 
No butterflies of fashion there, 
Or idlers may be found, 
11 
But men with open hearts and hands, 
With honest labor browned; 
Men who to help a 
friend in need, 
Would their last dollar lend, 
Who never live on other filks, 
But earn the cash they spend. 
SPOKEN. — Yes, there is no place in the Bowery for those well-
d 
ressed corner statues to try to look- 
like millionaire's sons, while 
their mothers are out scribbing fir a 
dollar a 
day to support 
them in idleaez,s. 
A felio .
.v 
has no business on the east 
siiti of town unless he w-tnts to work and elm his own living. 
What fortune i ; there More honorable than that of a 
working 
man. 
There was Washington, he was a 
farmer. and Franklin a 
printer. 
Warren a 
doctor. 
Andy Johnson a 
tailor. 
Abe Lin-
coln a 
rail-s1;litter, and Grant a 
tanner. 
If you want to see 
men who make our country great, who add to her wealth, de-
velop her resources. maintain her strength and prosperity, you 
will always find them— 
In the Bowery, dr,c. 
The other day a 
well-dressed fop, 
While walkin4 through the street, 
Insulted a 
poor workino-
With whom he chanced to meet 
A 
young mechanic came along, 
And heard tile words he said 
He soon pitched in to the fop 
And on him put a 
head. 
SPOKEN. — Yes, he laid the cowardly rascal cut. " Ncw," he 
says, i• 
it up and git, and if I 
ever catch you inzultine- a 
female 
again I'll mid a 
French roof to that head I've Fit on you." 
The dandy quietly sneaked away: the young lady turned to her 
a 
• 
• 
preser7-er, with tears in her eyes, and said; " My dear sir, how 
can I 
ever thank you for the kindness which you have shown 
me in protecting me from the insults of that ruffian and I 
hope 
sir, we shall meet again. 
Do you live near here? 
Certainly, 
young lady, I'm always found— 
In the Bowery, &-,
c. 
When dark rebellion raised its head, 
And war o'er-spread the land, 
When rushed unto t]olumbia's aid 
Each gallant hero h 
Among the I ) 73:nost on the field, 
Amid the b.ittle's noise, 
Upholding still our starry flag; 
Was found the Bowery boys. 
SPOKEN—When the call came for callers in the hour of dan-
ger, the Bowery was the first to send its volunteers, and nobly 
did they do their duty, 
Who does not remember that incident 
at the battle of Antietam, when the enemy charged in full force, 
• 
one brave regiment bravely stood its ground, under a 
terrilic 
fire and chimged the tide of seeming de.Liat to one of gl—ious 
victory. 
This was notice.] by General McClellan, who ex-
claimed; " What re ,,hnent i

PARTING AT THE GATE. 
Composed by J. S. Cox, for SHERIDAN & MAC1L 
I 
WAS walking out one evening, 
'Twas in the month of May, 
A 
pretty maid was by my side, 
Who stole my heart away; 
She looked so sweet and loving, 
I 
vowed that soon or late, 
I'd steal a 
kiss from that young miss, 
When partir;g at the gate. 
CHORUS. 
'Twas on one pleasant summer's night, 
But never nand how late, 
I 
vowed to kiss this charming miss, 
When parting at the gate. 
I
. 
We met quite often after that, 
'Till on one summer-night, 
I 
told my love I 
did the same, 
I 
trembled with delight; 
She vowed that she'd be faithful, 
I 
blessed my lucky fate, 
Of course, I 
kissed this charming misa

A MEDLEY 
As sung by Miss Jenney Hughes 
Maid of Athens ere we part, 
Give, oh 1 
g' ve me back my heart, 
And it's if you want to hire me, 
Step into Mickey .4

And ask me not, why my fond 
Emotion,

Little Jack Horner, he sat in a 
corner,

Eating a 
Christmas pie, 
lie stuck in his thumb and be pulled 
Out— 
Old dog Tray's ever-faithful, 
Grief cannot drive him away, 
lie's gent'e and he's kind, • 
You'll never , never find, a,h! ah! ah! 
All among the hay boys, 
All among the hay, can't you have 
a 
jolly spree— 
Out in this cold world, 
Out in the street— 
Asking a 
penny from each one I 
meet, 
I'm hungry— 
And tired now, and sleepy too,— 
So put rue in my little bed. 
Come' sister come, kiss me good night, 
For I 
feel just as happy as'a big sun 
flower. 
That nods and bends in the breezes, 
And my heart is as light as the 
wind that blows, 
Over the sea, over the sea, 
hear what a 
little bird whispers to me, 
Oh I 
Come back to Erin, Mavourneen 
Mavourneen! Come back Aroon, 
to the land of thy birth, 
And riding in a 
sleigh boy's 
Passing all the style, 
Talking to a 
pretty girl as we are 
passing by, 
How the bells are jinglin, 
As so merrily we fly 
Behind our two forty nag, 
Oh! how is that for high':

COURTING IN THE RAIL 
ONE April morn, when walking down, 
A 
quiet country lane, 
I 
overtook a 
fair young girl, 
Whilst hurrying through the rain. 
I 
asked her " If she would accept 
My arm and take a 
share 
Of my umbrella ?" " Thanks, kind Sir, 
I 
will," replied the fair. 
1 
SPOKEN. — One width golden locks, by Jove, and without et:e 
of those useful articles (holding up Umbrella)--when she 
popped her little arm in mine, my heartbeat to that degree it 
nearly dislocated my ribs (of the Umbrella I 
mean -
) 
it's a 
fact: I 
thought to myself, here's a 
chance to go— 
Cuonts. 
Courting in the rain, courting in the min, 
ne'er regret the day I 
met my charmer in the lane: 
Courting in the rain, courting in the rain, 
'Twas sweeter far than moon or star, 
Whilst cour, lug Mary Jane. 
The rain poured down alarmingly, 
When to a 
tree we came, 
And shelter took beneath it: 
There I 
quickly learnt her name. 
She also told me where she lived, 
With Pa down at the farm, 
A 
farmer's daughter: well, said I, ' 
That is an extra charm. 
15 
SPOKEV.—I glory in country life, and a 
iarmers ctaughter 
what could be better ? I 
wished the rain would keep on as 't 
rather liked--
Courting in the rain, &o. 
At length the rain abated, 
And the sun shone out quite bright, 
The little birds began to sing, 
My heart it felt so light— 
I 
gently pressed her arm in mine, 
And said: " Now don't aay nay, 
But let me come and meet you here 
Again, some other day." 
SPOKEN.—" Well, she said, I 
can't exactly decide, you must 
esk my Pa—" So I 
made up my mind to go in and inform th3 
old gentleman we'd been 
Courting in the rain, 
We reached the old farm-house, and then 
She introduced to me 
Her Pa, a 
jolly nice ohl ooy, 
With him I 
made quite free: 
I 
told him where and when I'd met, 
His daughter in the rain, 
And ble:4.-ed the lucky chance that took 
Me down that country lane— 
SPOKEN.— The old gentleman was quite delignted with my 
kind attention, and I 
soon gained his consent, whicn proves the 
truth of the eld proverb—" It never rains but it pours," and so 
it occurred tc me through— 
Courting in the rain, cte.

KILLARNEY. 
published in B. W. Hitchcock's Half Dime series, 
By Killarney's lakes and fells, 
Em' raid isles and winding bays, 
Mountain paths and woodland dells. 
Alem'ry ever fondly strays. 
Bounteous nature loves all lands, 
Beauty wanders ev'ry where, 
Footprints leaves on many strands: 
But her home is surely there ! 
Angels fold their wings, and rest 
In that Eden of the west, 
Beauty's home, Killarney, 
Ever fair Killarney. 
Innisfallen's ruin'd shrine, 
May suggest a 
passing sigh, 
But man's faith can ne'er decline, 
Such God's wonders floating by, 
Castle Lough and Glenna Bay, 
Mountains Tore and Eagle's Nest, 
Still at Mucross you must pray, 
Though the monks are now at rest. 
Ange's wonder not that man 
There would fain prolong life's span, 
Beauty's home, Killarney, 
Ever fair Killarney.

No place else can charm the eye, 
With such bright and varied tints, 
Every rock that you pass by, 
Verdure broiders or besprints. 
Virgin there the green grass grows, 
Every morn Spring's natal day, 
Bright-hued berries daff the snows, 
Smiling winter's frown away. 
Angels often pausing there, 
Doubt if Eden were more fair, 
Beauty's home, Killarney, 
Ever fair Killarney, 
Music there for Echo dwells, 
Makes each sound a 
harmony, 
Many-voiced the chorus swells, 
Till it faints in ecstacy. 
With the charmful tints below 
Seems the heaven above to vie, 
All rich colors that we know, 
Tinge the cloud wreaths in that sky. 
Wings of angels so might shine, 
Glancing back soft light divine, 
Beauty's home. Killarney, 
Ever fair Killarney.

WON'T you tell me, Mollie darling, - 
That you love none else but ? 
For I

You are all the world to me. 
Oh! tell me, darling, that you love me, 
Put your little hand iii miue,

Say that you will give me thine.

Mollie, fairest, sweetest, dearest, 
Look up, darlin! ,,

Do you love me, Mollie darling ? 
Let your answer be a 
kiss. 
Stars are smiling, Mollie darling, 
Through the mystic wail of night; 
They seem laughing, Mollie darling, 
While fair Lima hides her light; 
Oh ! no one listens but the flowers, 
While they hang their heads in shame, 
They are modest, Mollie darling, 
When they hear me call your name. 
Mollie, fairest, &c. 
must leave you, MoILe darling, 
Though the parting gives me pain; 
When the stars shine, Mollie darling, 
I 
will meet you here again. 
Oh! good- night, Mollie, good-bye, loved one 
Happy may you ever be, 
When you're dreaming, Mollie darliii• 
Don't forget to dream di' me.

STROLLING ON THE SANDS. 
As sung by EDDY NORIVOOD. 
OF course we all know Ramsgate well, 
That spot to thousands deal, 
Where dashing belles and heavy swells, 
Assemble ev'ry year: 
Some like to roam along the Pier, 
And view what that commands, 
But my delight from morn till night, 
Is strolling on the sands. 
CHORUS. 
Strolling on the sands, strolling on the sands, 
Watching all the bathers dip, list' fling to the band, 
Strolling on the sands, strolling on the sands, 
In cool or heat there's nought to beat, a 
stroll upon the sands. 
ne'er forgA last summer-time, 
I 
spent a 
fortnight there, 
And made the sweet acquaintance of 
A 
lovely lady fair 
She'd gone to bathe at Dampton Gap, 
But, oh! the naughty queen, 
For once she thought she'd do without 
That vile bathing machine.

She placed her clothes unon-the beach 
And then in the water played, 
But when she tried to come on shore, 
Olt l 
wasn't she dismayed; 
The tide had turn'd, and all her clothes 
Were floating out to sea, 
She'd nothing but her bathing dress— 
In what a 
plight to be. 
Strolling dr,c, 
I 
fetch'd her mother to her aid, 
And saved all further strife, 
The maiden said, " this great event 
I'll think of all my ife." 
We soon became the best of friends 
For all enjoy'd the fun; 
We're lovers now—and soon we two 
Are going to be one.

I'VE been thinking of late, I've been thinking, 
My thoughts I 
can scarcely define, 
I've been thinking why people can wonder, 
At this terrible increase of crime; 
Cries, Old Uncle Sam it's a " poser," 
There's a 
something I 
can't understand, 
I 
would just give a 
trifle to know, sir, 
Why crime should increase in our land. 
I'm sure that we've plenty of gold, sir, 
Our banks are as full as can hold, sir,. 
We could buy the whole world I 
am told, sir, 
Yet still, there's an increase of crime. 
It's true what you say, Uncle Samuel, 
We've plenty of gold laid away, 
Mouldy with mildew and rust, sir, 
Guarded by night and by day; 
While you, like a 
dog in the manger, 
Your gold to yourself you confine, 
When a 
little would make a 
great change, sir, 
In this terrible increase of crime. 
For expenses you don't care a 
groat, sir, 
Politicians, you feed a 
whole lot, sir, 
While the poor man, with hunger may rot, sir, 
And still you wonder at crime. 
I 
am sure you will own Uncle Sam, sir, 
Temptation is hard to resist, 
Just look at our poor working girl, sir, 
Striving her best to exist;

Uncle Sam can you wonder at crime. 
Can you wonder at crime can you wonder, 
When you see the police on his beat, 
Arresting a

THE FACTORY GIRL OF MANCHESTER, 
As sung. by Miss JENNIE EXCEL. 
'TWAS dow-a in Lancashh‘e in the wintry month of March 
To commeoce my unhappy little story: 
I 
met a 
little loss, whom none could surpass, 
But she's left me alone in my ;glory. 
;The wore a 
blue print gown, and a 
shawl on her arm, 
And a 
handkerchief, the col(); I've forg,otten ; 
Fbe'd a 
Oarnling ! Ude head, the hair of which was red, 
And smothered all over with cotton. 
CHOELTS. 
I 
brought her up to town into West minkter, 
She was liserlily Oeli-hted with the dancing; 
And her 1)1*.:Ity little clogs went tap. tap, tap, 
And I 
couldn't keep her still for her prancing 
She said she was single, and would like to wed 
To soup, one who was a 
famous Comic Singer, 
Then she s:1i.1 to me, I'd like to marry thee, 
If thrall place the little ring upon my fingt,r; 
I 
ran as quicl: as thought, and the little gem I 
bought 
And gave it her ;or ever, as I 
told her; 
But the naughty little Miss, a 
few wecks after this, 
Was married to a 
six-foot soldier. 
I 
brought her, &c. 
What these pretty girls w:11 do to lovers kind and true, 
Ilow they fool them, teaze them, and despise them; 
rmil it is too late, and tl,ey have joined their fate 
By wedding those who know not how to pri7e them. 
So you see I've lost the girl, wiln I 
thought a 
priceless pearl, 
It serves me right for being such a 
spooney, 
So young lads beware, of this factory girl take care, 
Or like me you'll become a 
perfect looney. 
I 
brought her, &c.

PICCADILLY, 
Sung by M ISS JENNIE ENGEL. 
SOME fella's think the Zoo's the spot 
For the " creme de la creme" 
And crawl into the monkey house, 
To hear their brothers scream ! 
While some declare that Belgrave Square's 
The Eden of the West, 
To meet with swells and dashing belles 
But by Jove, I 
know the best 
SPOKEN.—The locality I 
refer to is. 
Cnonus. 
Piccadilly, Piccadilly! 
For elegant swells and the fairest of belles, 
Piccadilly, Piccadilly, 
That's where I 
reside when in town. 
Sometimes I 
do a 
gentle crawl, 
By Jove, I've-gone that far, 
That I 
have nearly knocked against 
That horrid Temple Bar; 
At once I've lmil'd a 
Hansom 
" 
Haw, cabby, heaw, come heaw, 
Oh! drive me home directly or 
By Jove, I 
shall be queer." 
SPOKEN.---Where to 
confound the fella, why of course 
Piccadilly, &c. 
Sometimes into the Burlington 
Arcade a 
fellow drops, 
Because a 
fella cannot bear 
The Common sort of shops, 
, 
The doosed beadle knows me there 
As he walks up and down, I 
He'll call me captain, touch his hat 
And that costs half a crown. 
SPoKEN.--Of course a 
fella must spend half-a-crown 
now and then especially if he resides in 
Piccadilly, &c. 
One meets in Piccadilly, folks 
Who are well known at court, 
No retired talloW chandlers there 
No vulgar trading sort - 
A 
legacy enables me 
To mix with the elite 
And many a 
fair charmer there 
I'm fortunate to meet: 
SPOKEN — Among my aristocratic acquaintances I 
num-
ber the Honorable Priscilla Pimple, Lady Dudley Dood-
lem, the Duchess of Cowcrosshire, and many other first-
class people, and they all reside in 
Piccadilly, &c. 
But this butterfly existence now 
With me will soon be past, 
For Hymen soon will bind me 
In his rosy fetters fast; 
I 
shall shortly pop the question, 
To the child of an M. P. 
I'm sure to be accepted, so 
It's all U. P. with me. 
SPOKEN.—But I 
suppose a 
fella oughn't to grumble at 
the present of a 
fair creature and a " plum" a 
year. Proper 
weddings are generally done at Hanover' S4uare, but I 
mean to patronize the little church in

First Lover. 
I'VE just arrived in town to day, 
To see the girl I 
love, 
She lives in yonder little cot, 
She is my turtle dove; 
I 
know I've got a 
rival, 
That comes here on the sly, 
I'm bound to have the girl you bet, 
At least I'm going to try.

Oh, my, the girl she must be mine, 
With her Grecian bend stuck out behind, 
I'm bound to have the girl you know, 
The:fairest in the land, 
And I 
never will be satisfied, 
Until I 
take her hand. 
Second Lover 
I 
wonder who that feller was, 
He thinks he cuts a 
shine, 
He comes around the OA I 
love, 
And very soon I'll find;

He'd better quickly take a 
walk, 
On him I'll put a 
head, 
And send him home with his Ma, 
She'll put him right in bed. 
Oh, my, the girl, &c. 
Both. 
Oh, what's the matter? excuse me, sir, 
What was you doing here ? 
Second Lover. 
I 
came to court the girl I 
love, 
Now don't you interfere. 
First Lover. 
I'd interfere, just if I

For you was now on time.

But don't turn up at me your nose.

Look, darling, tell me that,

And you are my loving spouse, 
We'll have lots of Dolly Vardens, 
Playing around the house.

Gently put on them a

If Ever I 
Cease to Love. 
BY GEORGE LEYBOURNE. 
IN a 
house, in a 
square, in a 
quadrant, 
In a 
street, in a 
lane, in a 
road, 
Turn to the left on the right hand, 
You see there my true love's abode. 
I 
go there a 
courting and cooing, , 
To my love like a 
dove, 
And swearing on my bended knee, 
If ever I 
cease to love, 
May sheep's heads grow on apple trees) 
If ever I 
cease to love. 
CHORUS. 
If ever I 
cease to love, 
If ever I 
cease to love, 
May the moon be turn'd into green cheese, 
If ever I 
cease to love. 
She can sing, she can play the piano, 
She can jump, she can dance, she can run, 
In fact she's a 
modern Taglioni 
And Sims Reeves rolled into one. 
And who would not love such a 
beauty 
Like an angel dropped from above, 
May I 
be stung to death with flies, 
If ever I 
cease to love. 
May I 
be stung to death with flies, 
If ever I 
cease to love. 
If ever I 
cease to love, 
If ever I 
cease to love, 
May little dogs wag their tails in front, 
If ever I 
cease to love. 
For all the money that's in the bank, 
For the title of a 
lord or a 
duke, 
I 
wouldn't exchange the girl I 
love, 
There's bliss in every look. 
To see her dance the polka, 
I 
could faint with radiant love, 
May the Monument a 
hornpipe dance 
If ever I 
cease to love. 
May we never have to pay the iLICOMO Tax, 
If ever I 
cease to love. 
If ever I 
cease to love, 
If ever I 
cease to love, 
May wo all turn into cats and dogs, 
If ever I 
cease to love. 
May all the seas turn into ink, 
May negroes all turn A\ hite, 
May the Queen in Buckingham Palace live, 
May we idrink too much wine to- night. 
May cows lay eggs, my fowls yield milk, 
May the elephant turn a 
dove, 
May Bobbies refuse te eat cold meat, 
If ever I 
cease to love. 
May I 
be stuffed with sausage meat, 
If over I 
cease to love. 
If ever I 
cease to love, 
If ever I 
cease to love, 
May each old maid be blessed with twins, 
If over I 
cease to love. 
OH, how I 
envy girls who have 
Their lovers close at home, 
While distance keeps me far from mine, 
Who o'er the seas muct roam; 
Should I 
but see him twice a 
year, 
Contented I 
must be, 
And hope he'll ne'er forget my words 
-When last he went to sea. 
CHORE'S. 
Good-bye, Charlie, when you are away, 
Write me a 
letter, love; send me a 
letter, 
love, 
Good-bye, Charlie, when you are away 
Do not forget your Nellie, darling ? 
How nice the drive, the game at chess, 
Or moonlight walk must be 
How nice to have one's love " drop in " 
To take a 
cup of tea 
How nice to have sweet billet-doux 
Arrive by ey'ry post I 
The whilst poor me can but expect 
Just two a 
year at most. 
Good•bye, Charlie, ezo. 
It's hard to see such swarms of swells, 
Who stay at home at ease, 
The while my darling has to sail 
The wide and. stormy seas. 
But I 
suppose it would not do 
For all to stay at home, 
And. so I 
can but hope my lovo 
Ere long will cease to roam. 
Good-bye, Charlie, &o.

Music by .1. WHITMORE. 
OH! Mollie, darling, the anchor is weighed 
The ship is now ready to sail o'er the sea, 
Each moment is precious, and time will not wait, 
Oh ! Mollie, my treasure, do listen to me; 
You're going far away from kindred and friends, 
Off to the land that is far o'er the foam, 
We've no one but you to gladden our hearts— 
Don't leave us, Mollie, sweet light of our home.

Don't cross the sea, Mollie, and leave us alone, 
For dreary our beautiful home then will be. 
We've no one to care for but you, Mollie dear, 
Don't leave us, darling. 
Oh! listen to me. 
Oh! Mollie, my darling, your father is ill, 
But still he has come down to see you depart. 
He stands by your side in our sorrow and pain, 
And tears tell the anguish that lies in his heart, 
! 
come to my arms, let me fold you again, 
Close to the heart that is throbbing for thee, 
Remember the days when I 
sang you to sleep, 
Don't leave us, Mollie, to cross the blue sea. 
Don't cross the sea, Mollie, &c. 
Oh! Mollie, my darling, say what will you do, 
Alone in a 
land where but strangers abide, 
No kind words you'll hear of advice, Mollie dear, 
But ah ! many evils will lurk at your side; 
Let me kiss you, perhaps for the last time on earth. 
For we are old, and our days arc but few, 
There's tears in your eyes, I 
sc,c you'll not go— 
Heav'n pour sweet blessings, dear Mollie, on you. 
Don't cross the sea, Mollie, &e.

They play such jolly music, 
Waltz, Polka and Quadrille; 
And sometimes play so feelinglro

The Leader sometimes gives a

And looks as though he's rash; 
And then they play so soft and sweet, 
And after comes a

Ain't it Nice to Have a 
Beau? 
BY 
ART1kR W . 
FRENCEI. 
AS you out a 
walking go, 
When the crowds are in the street, 
Passing by you to and fro, 
Oft by chance SOME ONE you meet; 
Soon he's walking by your side, 
With his arm in yours—just so— 
Looking down on you with pride— 
Ain't it nice to have a 
beau ? 
CHORUS. 
Ain't it nice to have a 
beau, 
One N-ho loves you well, you know, 
As you out a 
walking go— 
Ain't it nice to have a 
beau ? 
Arm in arm you stray along, 
Envied by each single lass, 
Who from out the passage throng, 
Jealous glances on you cast. 
And, the swells that try to flirt 
Find that they have got no show, 
Deeming you so proud and pert— 
Ain't it nice to have a 
beau? 
By and by you reach the door, 
While, of course, just there and then 
Words of love HE whispers o'er, 
Sayin7, he will come again. 
Loving lips 10 yours are pressed, 
An I 
you murmur softly—oh! 
Don't you wish you knew the rest? 
Ain't it thee to have a 
beau ?

LIKE a 
game at Croquet 
Or bowling on the green, 
I 
like a 
little boating 
To pull against the stream,

Through the bush and bramble, 
Kiss and never tell. 
Talk about your bathing 
Or strolling on the sands 
Or some unseen verandah 
Where gentle zephyr fans, 
Or rolling home in the morning, boys, 
And very nearly tight, 
Could never beat a 
ramble 
Upon a 
starry night. 
A starry night for a

I 
like to take my sweetheart 
"Of course you would" said he, 
And softly whisper in her ear 
"How dearly Hove you,"

The scenes of such delight, 
You'll want to take a

Upon a

A

Some will choose a

And others take a 
drive, 
And some will sit and mope at home 
Half dead and half alive. 
And some will choose a

And others even fight, 
But I'll enjoy my ramble 
Upon a 
starry night.

PERHAPS SHE'S ON THE RAILWAY. 
BEHOLD in me a

Perhaps she's up in a

Perhaps she's dead, perhaps alive, porhaps she's" on the sews 
Perhaps she's gone to Brigham Young, a 
Mormonite to be. 
She read so much of Mormonites, of nothing else she'd talk, 
And with a 
sanctified young chap each day she used to 
walk; 
She said he was a 
Mormon saint from far across the sea, 
I 
have not seen her for a

Perhaps she's, &c. 
She can't respect the marriage vows, that faithfully she

I 
hope they'll always row and fight wherever they may be.

pleasant dream of fairies wit:I:Alt number, 
All singing sweetly to me, when I'm waken'd from my slumber

WAITING FOR A 
BROADWAY STAGE. 
AS up Broadway I 
strolled one day, 
To see the styles pass by, 
A 
pretty little girl I 
very soon met, 
And she had such a 
roguish eye; 
her little short skirts in points hung down, 
For that style's all the rage; 
She was looking up and down, with a 
pretty little frown, 
Waiting for a 
Broadway stage, oh! 
Crrouus. 
She was just about the girl that's all the rage; 
Sweet sixteen was just her age; 
I 
met her on the corner; it was there that first I 
saw her, 
Waiting for a 
Broadway stage, 
She saw that I 
was looking at her, 
When a 
sweet little smile, like a 
beam, 
.1ust played round her face, and, with such ease and grace. 
Why, like an angel she did seem. 
Wit I 
kept getting like one in fear, 
For my heart felt like a 
bird that's in a 
cage; 
how I 
wished I'd never have seen that handsome little queen 
Waiting for a 
Broadway stage, oh! 
She was just, &c. 
But as the ice was broken, my hat of course, I 
raised, 
As the stage, she required, soon came by; 
When she said in tones so sweet, perhaps some time we'll meet 
As up the steps her little form did fly. 
But I 
never since have seen her, so I 
wander in despair, 
For it seems that since she left me ' twas an age; 
But I 
never shall forget that little girl I 
met, 
Waiting for a 
Broadway stage, oh! 
She was just, &a.

AFTER THE OPERA'S OVER 
ikfter the Opera's over, 
Gas tries to outshine the stars, 
When half the world sleep contented, 
We'll champagne and smoke fine cigars; 
For life without pleasure is cold, 
And I 
shouldn't live very long, 
But how we survive in the Avenue, 
I'm delighted to tell in my song. 
Sms-AN—With a 
tootle turn turn accompaniment upon the piano 
from the fair hands of a 
lady we sing— 
After the Opera's over, 
After the Opera's done, 
We gems of the very first water, 
With the ladies we tootle turn turn., 
I 
keep my own box at the Opera, 
I've racers and hunters as well, 
Estates and lands in the country, 
So much money I 
cannot tell. 
Then why should I 
let myself down, 
And neither spend money or lend, 
For money well spent brings joys, 
Yes money was made to spend. 
After the Opera, et* 
After the Opera's over, 
Fifth Avenue could tell many tales, 
And as I 
am one of its people, 
It wouldn't be fair to drive nailes. 
Suffice me to say that at night, 
We, " Upper Ten," never feel glum, 
We dance, sing and play till morn, 
With the ladies we tootle turn turn. 
After the Opera, ate. 
After your business take pleasure, 
But business, by Jove, I've none. 
A 
fellow to find out his troubles, 
Why hang it, I 
don't see the fun. 
To vou that have money to spend, 
Just take a 
lesson by me, 
Live in the Squares of Fifth Avenue, 
Aad the pleasures of life you'll see.

She's doing the grand in a

That all other folks are but fools,

A SMILE WAS ALL SHE GAVE ME. 
Written and sung by Bobby Newcomb. 
Not long ago, I 
was the beau 
Of a 
pretty girl, named Mary; 
With a 
face so sweet, and a 
s'yle so neat 
And a 
step just like a 
fairy. 
We courted long, our love was strong: 
How I 
wished that she would have me 1 
But when I 
did the question pop: 
A 
smile was all she gave me. 
CIIORTJS. 
And she was so fair, I 
do declare, 
How I 
wished that she would have men 
But when I 
did the question pop: 
A 
smile was all she gave me. 
I 
sent her notes, I 
sent her flowers, 
I 
took her out a- riding: 
Row quick time flies when love and sighs 
Are with the hours gliding! 
A 
rival was my only fear : 
And I 
eGuldn't think, to save me, 
That when I 
asked her who he was, 
A 
smile was all she gave me. 
Chorus. 
At last, a 
note, I 
got one day, 
And dreadful news it carried, 
Inviting me to come and see— 
Herself and rival married! 
Now off I 
went, on death was bent, 
Resolved that none should save me— 
But I 
am not dead, though she got wed, 
And a 
smile ,was all she gave me.

rare amusement for Young Ladies 
and Gentlemen. 
A Beautiful Cloth Gilt Volume. 
Read what two leading New York papers say of it. 
The New 
York Evening Mail writes: 
A 
little book has lately appeared in print at Messrs. Psher & 
Denison's, 98 Nassau street, called "The Little Flirt." We 
cannot 
say that we recommend it to our young lady and gentlemen readers, 
as we think it would only encourage the bad habit of " flirting." 
Unfortunately there 
there is enough of it done without any ZurthQr neces-
sity of explaining "how, when and where ta do it," and this little 
volume would advise and jail late the uncorrupted in practising what 
is commonly called "flirting." 
The N. Y. Evening Telegram writes: 
We 
have lately seen a 
neat little book, bound in morocco, costing 
25 cents, caled "The Little Flirt," published by Messrs. Fisher & 
Denison, 98 Nassau street. 
It elves information of the modus oper-
andi o 
flirting, and of the meaning of every motion of the hand-
kerchief, fan, glove and parasol. As there is nothing at all objec-
tionable in the volume, and its contents might afford some innocent 
amusement to many, we do not hesitate to recommend it to our 
young ,lady and gentlemen readers. 
The LITTLE FLIRT contains Fourteen Silhouette Illus-
trations. 
Is bound with bevelled edges and gilt aides,
