Saul Castellanos interview, 2012-09-02 : interview conducted by Ellen E. 
McHale 
 
INTERVIEW LOG 
 
0:04-20 Introduction. Saul works for Mark Hennig.  
 
00:20 Brother was working for Wayne Lukas and he got Saul a job 
"walking hots." Saul has been working with the horses for twenty years. 
He started at the bottom like everyone else. He worked his way up. He 
was a night watchman and was a hot walker for Wayne Luckas. Walking 
Hots He was a groom for Denny Pites. Saul was a hot walker for Wayne 
Lukas when Mark Hennig was an Assistant Trainer. After quitting the 
track for a time, Saul saw Mark Hennig at Belmont and asked for a job 
and he started with Mark as a hot walker, at the bottom again. 
 
1:31 Saul's brother is Rafael Castellanos and he works now in horse 
transportation for air travel. Similar to a flight attendant for horses.  
 
2:18 It used to be that people got a job with the assistance of others. 
Now people come into the business just because they love horses and 
they get experience on the job. Before, it was difficult to get a job 
because family connections were important: my brother brought him and 
he brought another brother and he brought his friends.  
 
3:39 Most of grooms go back and forth. People get temporary visas for 9 
months and then have to go back to renew it.

4:10 Saul is originally from Jalisco, Mexico. He grew up in a farm in 
Mexico, his father had horses and Saul worked with horses there. He 
didn’t know that Mexico had racetracks until he came to the USA.  
 
5:02 He came to the US for Spring break and he stayed for the last 20 
years. His brother brought him here.  
 
5:25 You learn a lot from horses. If you are nice to the horses, they are 
nice to you.  
 
5:50 An assistant trainer makes sure that everything is ok for the trainer. 
Makes sure that the people are working correctly and that the horses are 
ok. Saul checks the horses' feed tubs when he arrives at 4:30 a.m.. If 
there is food left over than they check their temperatures. You take the 
wraps off the legs and make sure that there is no heat in the legs. Makes 
sure that the horses are taken out on schedule and you check their legs 
before they go out. He makes sure everything is OK in the barn. He also 
talks to the owners. Now with technology, most people check the 
internet. He makes sure that the owners know when their horses are 
running. He clocks their work-outs and puts the time on the website. He 
does a little bit of everything. It is a fun and interesting job. You meet a 
lot of people. At Saratoga people come from all over the country.  
 
8:12 They have 29 horses here at Saratoga. Every trainer is allowed 29 
or 30 stalls. They have horses also at Monmouth, NJ. Their base is 
Belmont.  
 
8:42 You do the same job wherever you are.  
 
2 
 
9:02 From Saratoga they will go to Belmont (after Labor Day). Saul 
stays at Belmont all winter and they also race at Aqueduct after 
Belmont.  
 
9:45 In the winter they send half of the horses to Florida with the trainer, 
Mark Hennig. They train at Palm Meadows. Saul stays in New York.  
 
10:22 In total, they have between 60-75 horses that they train. When a 
horse is not being trained, it is laid off. It gives a lot of people jobs.  
 
10:54 For every four horses there is a groom and a hot walker, so two 
people for four horses. They had 23-25 people in Saratoga besides him 
and his boss. Saul does the hiring. He says that he hires people and they 
stay forever. He is proud of his crew. Every time he hires someone he 
makes a home.  
 
12:06 They have a lot of people from Guatamala and Mexico who work 
in the barn. The winters are hard for Saul because everyone goes to their 
countries.  
 
12:28 Saul hears that there is a lot of unemployment but at the racetrack 
there are jobs. But they are seven days a week jobs that a lot of people 
don’t want to do that. But the horses need seven day a week care. They 
eat all the time.  
 
13:34 A usual day is 12 hours long, 4:00 a.m. through 4:00 p.m. with a 
break at noon for lunch. It is not constant work, however. You have to 
be available. I want to be available to be somebody.  
 
3 
 
14:50 Being Spanish in America, you have to look up. You have to 
prove to people you can do it. Lots of people stay in the same position 
but not him. He wants to do more and more.  
 
15:15 For Mark Hennig, Saul is one of two assistant trainers. There is 
one in New Jersey and in Florida (Robbie), beside Saul in New York.  
 
15:40 There are two assistant trainers. Then there is a foreman who is 
Saul's assistant and a foreman for Robbie. In this barn, everyone knows 
what to do. If you ask people to do something and you say please and 
thank you, they will work hard.  
 
16:54 Every assistant trainer started at the bottom. If he became a trainer 
tomorrow, he would hire an assistant who had worked hard. Saul was a 
hot walker, he was cleaning stalls, he bedded in the tack room, he rode 
the trailer for 24 hours with the horses going to Florida. He is proud that 
he is an Assistant Trainer.  
 
18:11 He was asked at Belmont if he would be a mentor to people 
starting out. He wishes in his time people had instructed him on how to 
do the work. No one was telling him. When he came to Chicago for 
Spring Break to see his brother, his brother got him a job at the track and 
said, "here is your job, good luck, now I have to go to Kentucky 
tomorrow." So Saul was living with someone who he had never seen 
before – for two months – and could hardly speak English. He lived on 
chili-and-beans for a couple of months because that was all he could say 
in English. He was about 22-years old.  
 
19:50 He was in America for the first time. He thought he was the king 
because he was in America. When he got his first paycheck in Hot 
4 
 
Springs, Arkansas, he went to the bank and put it in but couldn’t speak 
English. He had an account for the first time. That was his American 
dream.  
 
21:14 You make friends here. You make family here. Right now, there 
are people from Guatamala, Argentina, El Salvador in the barn.  
 
22:03 Right now, there are more Guatamalans working for him. Most of 
the racetrack – the backside - are Latinos.  
 
22:50 Twenty years ago there were more horsemen in general. Now 
there are more businessmen. Of course they are all business but before 
you had to love the sport more than the money.  
 
23:50 Right now, the industry is doing a lot of good things. There was a 
dead-heat at the Travers. That was a huge event for Saul. That was 
racetrack history. He was proud of it. That will be in the history books. 
In New York we need to prove that we are still sports people.  
 
25:25 He has always worked for successful people: Wayne Lukas, Mark 
Hennig. If you have a lesser quality of horses you go to different tracks. 
(He doesn’t want to name them.) If you don’t have enough horses to 
compete in Saratoga there is no reason to come to Saratoga. You would 
go to a place where you could win. (He has never been in that situation.) 
 
26:40 Belmont is Saul's home. Belmont is one of the most beautiful 
tracks in America.  
 
27:04 He was at Keeneland way back, San Anita, Hollywood Park. A lot 
of beautiful tracks.  
5 
 
 
27:39 He has never been to the smaller tracks, like Finger Lakes.  
 
28:00 Being an assistant, there are never too many horses. The more 
horses the more chances you have to make money. If the horse wins a 
race, the assistant wins money through a bonus. If there are 100-200 
horses, more chances to make money. If you are a worker, that is a lot. 
Every groom rubs four horses. Every hotwalker walks four-five horses. 
If he had 100 horses, he'd have to hire more people. In the winter Saul 
only keeps 15-20 horses at Belmont. Less horses, less work, less chances 
to make money. But the winter in New York is brutal. One year he was 
down twelve horses. He finished early every day.  
 
31:14 Saul has to look at every horse, every day. He has to check each 
horses legs every day. You don’t want to send them to the track with 
sore legs. He sits in the middle of the barn and every horse has to pass 
by him.  
 
32:13 He loves Saratoga. He works more at Saratoga but after work 
every one goes to town to have fun. Even if you work seven days a week 
you have a real life. No matter how late you go to bed, you have to get 
up in the morning. If you want to sleep late, this is not the job for you.  
 
33:30 Saul wishes that the backstretch had more help. The people in the 
backside need support. They work seven days a week and they don't 
have too much life. They are taken to some places for fun, but they need 
more money. He doesn't mean those people who get paid and then spend 
their money at the bar. But people need a better life, they need better 
accommodations (rooms). They are not allowed to do anything. There 
are a dozen rules everywhere, but some of the rules are stupid. The rules 
6 
 
are for your accommodation, not theirs. They should be thinking of the 
workers because they are the people who make this work. Saul works for 
Mark Hennig who has been the best. There are a lot of people who treat 
people badly.  
 
37:09 Trainers speak to each other.  
 
37:40 Saul says he feels that people should be treated fairly and well.  
 
38:14 To get retirement, you have to wait a long time. You have to go 
through a lot of stuff to get there. They pay decently, not the best. But a 
lot of people work more than they are supposed to. And they don’t know 
that they are being overworked. And they get paid too low. This is at any 
track – Saratoga, Belmont, Kentucky. The people who work in this 
industry. For the workers to go to the grandstand – for them to buy 
something it's half their check. Even to go to the kitchen. It is these 
workers who make the races. They are not allowed to cook in their 
rooms.  
 
41:15 At Belmont you have more chances to rent places off the track. At 
Saratoga it is $1200.00 for the meet, $2000.00 for the six weeks.  
 
42:44 At Belmont, you can't cook in the rooms either. No track allows 
cooking because there is straw and hay around.  
 
44:40 Saul aspires to be a trainer some day. That is everybody’s dream. 
But he is picky. He wants to train his own horses, not someone else's. He 
wants to be me, me, and me. He would like to be a trainer, even if it is 
for two horses. He wants to be owner, Saul Castellanos and trainer, Saul 
Castellanos.  
7 
 
 
46:15 His friend, Andrew Lakeman, was a jockey and is doing well as a 
trainer with 4-5 horses.  
 
47:21 When Saul was a groom, his dream was to run the Kentucky 
Derby. That is everyone’s dream to be at the Derby. When he was 
rubbing horses he wanted to be a foreman. Then, he wanted to be an 
Assistant Trainer. He wanted to be a foreman because he wanted to ride 
a pony. Now he doesn't want to ride a pony anymore.  
 
49:04 "I want to say really loud – I'm here." End of Interview. 49:29. 
Saul Castellanos.  
 
Part II  
 
00:16 When his boss goes to Florida in the winter, Saul says he is in 
charge. He has to know the medication rules. He has to know the 
jockeys rules, entries. He has to go through a test. If you have been in 
the business than it's easy. There is a book to help you. At the back of 
every condition book for every track there are the rules for every track.  
 
1:39 When he told his boss he was going to take the test, it only took 5 
minutes. He called his boss to say he got his license and then Mark was 
able to leave for Florida. For his license, he had three references: Wayne 
Lucas, Kieran McLaughlin, and Todd Pletcher. He will have to take 
another test to become a trainer.  
 
3:15 First you have to say, "Yes, I can do it." Then you can do it. You 
have to be positive in life.  
 
8 
 
3:43 He thinks they work with about 10 different owners in the Mark 
Hennig stable. Some people have several horses in training. At Saratoga, 
most of the owners come to the meet. They bring doughnuts and coffee 
for the workers.  
 
4:40 Mark Hennigs father (John Hennig) was a trainer. He [John 
Hennig] breaks babies in the winter.
