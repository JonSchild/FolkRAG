October  6-9,  1994
 
US Air non-stop to Albany arrived 2:30 p. m.,  met by John
 
Suter.  He drove me to Ricketts Hall,  Sage College,  Troy,  a
 
pleasant  comfortable  facility where we stayed overnight,
 
partied,  banqueted,  and met.  Very convenient
 
The  first evening featured reading of the original speeches
 
from the first meeting of the Society.  Lydia Fish,  Bruce
 
Buckley,  Varick Chittenden did the honors.  The next morning
 
opened with a lengthy but extremely poetic invocation by
 
Mohawk leader Tom Porter,  who has recently led a delegation
 
of Mohawk families back to the Mohawk Valley where they
 
originally lived.  They have bought up a tract of land
 
including 15+ sacred sites and have settled in to try to
 
build a new Mohawk community supporting themselves by
 
farming.  These were the people who opposed the introduction
 
of gambling casinos on the Akwesasne Reservation and manned
 
the barricades unarmed during the recent  "war".  Porter is a
 
truly remarkable fellow,  in his  50s,  I' d say,  very bright and
 
very gentle in that  special  Indian way.
 
My paper was well received,  and Robert Baron did a nice  job
 
with his,  reviewing the history of the NY Folklore Society in
 
some detail.  There was  lots of reviewing of said history
 
during the next two days,  much of which was news to me,  and
 
they had a lot to be proud of,  I thought.  Apparently Dorson
 
made NYFS  into his particular devil,  because they published
 
authors  like Louis C.  Jones and Harold Thompson who Dorson
 
didn't think were scholarly enough.  Anyway,  he really went
 
for them;  Ben Botkin took up the editorial cudgels and had
 
back at him for years and years and that is why so many New
 
York folks call Botkjn their particular elder folklore hero.
 
The next  session included two traditional people  (Tom Porter,
 
and Colleen Cleveland,  who has taken up her grandmothe r's
 
cause and sings her songs  "as a gift" while supporting
 
herself as a house painter)  and two folklorists all
 
discussing reasonably amiably how song ownership can be
 
worked out.  Verdict:  the folks are going to make their
 
decisions based on their own cultural criteria(Tom and
 
Colleen had very different points of view)  and the
 
folklorists are going to have to continue struggling with the
 
inequities of copyright,  because that's the way the larger
 
publishing and recording system works.
 
That night there was a concert:  Vaughn and George Ward are
 
good singers of folk songs.  Vaughn is  really steamed about
 
having been turned down by the panel;  she has had academic
 
training,  she does work continually with tradition bearers,
 
and she knows and is  committed to the region.  She's a little
 
pushy and big-mama in style for my taste and I suspect  she
 
may get on the younger folklorists'  nerves,  but  I found it
 
difficult to refute her claims and there she  is and she's not
 
going to go away.  I advised her to talk matters over more in
 
depth with F&TA and turn in some  local knowledgable panel
 
names.  Colleen Cleveland sings a capella with the  same kind
 
of sweet  slightly trained vocal style her grandma had;  she
 
isn't as  compelling but  she made her way accurately through
 
several  lengthy ballads and didn't drop a note.  Paul Kibler
  
is a lovely fiddler;  I don't know that  repertory well enough
 
to rate him but he played up a very pleasant  storm and
 
absolutely delighted Tom Porter,  who said somewhat  sheepishly
 
when it came his turn that,  though Mohawks don't  fiddle,  he
 
really loved fiddling,  also Patsy Cline.  Tom Porter  
brought
 
in some younger folks both Indian and miscellaneous and
 
taught  four social dances to the music of three young fellows
 
playing small water drums and rattles and singing quite well.
 
Lots of people  joined in and a great time was had by all.
 
Saturday Jerry Hirsch spoke about Botkin followed by Debora
 
Kodish who was as usual extremely nervous but gave a really
 
excellent paper on her views on the theories behind public
 
folklore.  I was able to compliment her really honestly and
 
asked for a copy which she said she would send I didn't agree
 
with her  100% but it was  impressive. John Roberts then read
 
"John Mason Brewer:  Regionalism and African American
 
Folkioristics"  ,
 another good job.  It was a useful modestly
 
expressed paper about a fellow who has  long been categorized
 
as an Uncle Tom and it was  far from John's often somewhat
 
hectoring tone.  I do believe he may be mellowing a trifle.
 
Later Bruce Buckley recounted the conflicts  in New York
 
folklore history especially over Cooperstown,  and Ellen
 
Stekert,  who had arrived with a broken  jaw along with her
 
other physical disabilities,  spoke almost unintelligibly.  She
 
is  in awful shape,  poor woman.  The final paper of the day was
 
by Karen Taussig-Lux and Jessica Payne,  and it was  close to a
 
disaster.  They began by saying that their work in public
 
folklore often left them uncomfortable,  especially the
 
frequent need to explain their work in different terms  for
 
different audiences making them feel two-faced and
 
unscholarly;  also their continual perception that  in order to
 
fit various conditions  such as guidelines and agency policies
 
they were not only being pushed around themselves but being
 
made to impose these outside value structures on the folks.
 
And on and on they went,  basically explaining that their
 
situation wasn't perfect and how on earth should they cope
 
with it?  Steve Zeitlin and Robert took them on gently,  I less
 
smoothly because  I was quite tired by then and really
 
resented having to sit through such a sophomoric and lengthy
 
screed.  (They said some inaccurate and unkind things about
 
Folk Arts both national and state-wide,  but  I think the thing
 
that  irritated me most was their evident sense that they were
 
the only people who had ever been sensitive enough to notice
 
that there were these  in-built problems and difficulties.)
 
Karen,  I think,  was horrified to realize the effect of the
 
paper and came and talked a bit to me about  it.  I tried to be
 
both correcting and consoling and probably didn't do either
 
very well but we are still  friends,  I hope.  I believe what
 
went wrong was that the two of them likely talked back and
 
forth a lot while writing,  kind of unknowingly egging each
 
other on,  getting ever more sorry for themselves,  being ever
 
more outspoken and laying it on the line to their elders,
 
without  realizing just how it was going to be to say those
 
things to the same elders  in public.  I expect the eventual
 
paper will be considerably modified,  and everyone will have
 
learned from the experience,  me  included.
 
Lastly after a pleasant dinner,  there was a general sing led
 
very well and informally by the Wards.  Bruce Buckley sang
 
along,  knowing all the words,  and I began to realize looking
 
around the room that an awful lot of these  folks had actually
 
entered the world of folklore through becoming part of the
 
folksong revival and joining their college folksong club.  So
 
we  sang Michael Row the Boat Ashore and
 and Charley on the
 
MTA and the Banks of the Ohio and lots and lots of rounds
 
including one that goes
 
There would be  less danger
 
From the wiles of a stranger
 
If our own kin and kith
 
Were more  fun to be with.
 
and played a ridiculous hand game about a fellow who worked
 
in a button factory.  A most  satisfactory closing to a very
 
well planned and carried out conference,  with only one thing
 
wrong -
 poor attendance,  not more than  50 people any day.
 
Some things  I learned:
 
1
)  If I ever want a conference planned,  carried out,  and
 
run,  I would try to persuade John Suter to do it.
 He is A+.
 
2)  We should note the extreme closeness of the middle
 
aged folklorists and the middle aged revivalists;  they' re
 
often actually the same people or they were.  Maybe this  is a
 
key to trying to heal over that difficult breach.
 
3)  We must develop some
 be tter
 way
 of  thinking
 about
 the
 
"ethical" problems that young public workers are talking
 
about.  They are getting all tied up in unnecessary knots,  and
 
my remarks on the topic in my opening speech clearly didn't
 
help.  Deborah Kodish took a much more radical and lively
 
point of view.
 
4)  These upstate New York folks have a long history of
 
public and academic activity behind them.  They also are very
 
proud of having fought Dorson tooth and nail for some years
 
and consider themselves automatically on the side of public
 
folklore.  Part  of this  is  reflected in their numerous small
 
popular publications,  all those  little Catskill books;  this
 
is what Dorson hated and what they were and are using to try
 
and get  stuff back to the folks.  I wish I had realized this
 
when  I was dealing with them.

Thursday's opening event, a recapitulation of the 1944 founding meeting at

nstitute, and Saturday evening's banquet and music, song, and
 
dance party should be particularly stimulating and convivial t
imes.

, at 10:30.  We
 
would l
ike you to g
ive us the benefit of your extensive experience,
 
thinking, and l
eadership i

ield of folklore and folk arts on the
 
national level i
n the post World War I
I era.  Following your address,
 
Robert Baron w
ill g
ive opening remarks devoted to the h
istory of the f
ield
 
i
n New York State, so you needn't feel obliged to focus on New York
 
yourself.  As I mentioned to you on the phone, we p
lan to publish the
 
papers presented at the conference i
n the f
irst 1995 i
ssue of New York

two days of the conference (
presumably Friday and Saturday).  We may be
 
able to offer you an additional honorarium depending on the number of

fees for the additional days you spend at the conference.  You w

 When I was a

i
t just wasn't New York,  into the great city,  the biggest and most cor
tiplicat
 
in  the country,  maybe in the whole world.
 Then later on,  I found out there
 
as a whole enormous state of New York,  just as full of beauty and mystery as
 
bi g  city i
tself.
 
So I was really pleased to be asked to address the New York Folklore
 
bcciety because I
'm a long-term lover of the place and the people.
 Then I
 
hc
iught the occasion was interesting.
 There have been a large number of
 
:
c
rniversaries lately,  all starting with the mind-blowing extravaganza of the
 
'
atior
ial bicentennial.
 There have been so many ?? observations since then
 
t
hat people have gotten k
ind of bored and irritated with thinking them
 
irrelevant and unnecessary i
nterruptions to what should be going on.
 But the
 
calendar has i
ts own logic and should be attended to respectfully because
 
every now and again the calendar says we should take just a moment to stc
 
Well,  we should breathe.
 We have to,  to stay alive,  but we should inhale
 
then exhale.
 Taking in a few heady drafts of future possib1
 
exhaling some of the never to be despised ?? or past efforts.
 
Of course breathing is an incessant and unsolvable activity,  r-.Ln e
i
 
th  vL'k of folklore.
 Actually this morning I thought of a variation on
 
cid aphorism.
 Men
, work from sun to sun,  but a folklorist,  if he is a mar.
 
: join the women whose work is never done.
 So another common expressi
 
taking a breath,  has to mean to pause and this may mean simply becc
uminu
,
 
briefly conscious of the process of breathing.
 In just such a way s 
:nn
,iversaries pull our work, what we are actually doing,  into our
 
i
n
ids for a shc
 " 
1 ey  are useful
 
50 years.
 
r
y
e
i what American folklorists have been doing with ourselves since 1944.
 Whe
 
I came down to do all of this,  as nice as I felt about i
t,  I found i
t a b
 
duntir
ig because most of you already know what's been going for the past  
ears and you've heard about i
t.
 I
t really leads me to the fact that almc
 
everything I say this morning will certainly be old news to somebody.
 All
 
W,­
tan do is try to put a b
it of a new spin on i
t,  and to begin by pointing 1
-d"

j-,
t 
 we mAst always bar i
r 
,mind that the bulk of cur ererq i
 me and  ur t
 1
 
'
U
 
fo r  the past 50 years has beer 
,concerned in  responding with varying degrees Of
 
rffect to an enormously actively changing society,  one that has been notably
 
on the move,  with whole populations migrating south to north,  east to west and
 
back again,  with major industries that had employed thousands of people,
 
relocating themselves out of the United States,  leaving the folks behind,  with
 
-
1e virtual elimination of small farming in favor of agribusiness.
 With the
 
:evelopment of ar
t enormous service industry,  which is notably not centrali zed
 
bit spread,  indeed if I may say so,  splattered evenly across the nation s o
 
t
-hat few communities are any longer without their McDonalds or with their
 
'
cm's cafes.
 With all of these disruptive factors and more,  i
t's a wonder
 
:
here is any folklore around at all,  or any folklorists left to tell the tale.
 
For folklore and folk art,  however one may find them,  are never national.
 
They are i
nherently local phenom enon, occasionally regional,  but as the
 
(
T
h
iericar
u population becomes evermore mobile,  fewer and fewer distinctive
 
eographic cultural regions survive.
 I
've been wondering if their p
lace is
 
oartially being taken by ethnicity.
 Ethr
iicities frequently show enormous
 
coherence and tenacity across great distances of time and space.
 So do other
 
non-geographic alliances based on religion,  gender,  age and the l
ike.
 
r
icreasing strength of such groupings may result in part from the grad
 
breaking down of some of the smaller community ties.
 But those ties d
 
i
isappear,  if ever they really do,  but they are putting up a darn good fi
 
Tar example,  one of the features of the past 50 years has been the i
n
icreasir
 
:
ublic concern for the general health of tradit io n,
 for a better understand:
 
f the past as made present.
 
You know,  people don't
 
them or they quietly get them,  but now a days they are often vocally corcerr,
 
about the survival of those old things.
 That is pretty new.
 In response to
 
cuch public concerns,  after a 50-year span that began with the sudden,  and
 
:
y mind, tragic dismantling of the entire New Deal,  we now once more sec
 
federal action in this area.
 With the Arts & Humanities Endowment,  thE
-
Library of Congress,  the Smithsonian Institution and the National ParkE
:
-
Fervice investing modest but plainly defensible amount of public dollar
 
academic and public folklore programs.

This is a very significant change.
 50 years ago you would not have dreamed
 
many community-based activities going on,  nor would the government of
 
York have declared this Folklore Week.
 Even
t more significantly we see th
 
major issues of cultural identity,  the enrichment of the cultural histori
 
mcord,  the aesthetic innovations of small groups i
n similar topics fam
 
t o  folklorists,  have become major springboards for artistic creations
 
m
iters,  f
ilmmakers and musicians from the formalized art world.
 
Folklorists didn't write ROOTS,  nor did the discipline of folkic
 
i
t: bute to i
ts phenomenally successful reception.
 I
t was as flex f
t
 
p
lendid professional writer,  who put his particular genius to the job
 
asponding to an overwhelmingly important question that had gushed out
 
American population that half believed i
tself bereft of history and a

years,  during which the American people from coast to coast 27 about for
 
Letter sense of who they all are and where they all came from beca
 
fascinated with the old songs of the American frontier era and bey
.
 
F
olk song revival was a major cultural development.
 I
t was also,
 
cr
tsiderable part,  a quest for reassurance by a people who's insistence
 
rootlessness and rabid individualism was affording them ever more acute
 
aychic power.
 A great many academic folklorists didn't approve of the
 
avival,  thinking of i
t as inaccurate from a scholarly point of view
 
:
iersir
iiplified history.
 Commercial takeovers of groups own cultur.I
 
tradition,  maybe even a new k
ind of folklore.
 Then of course,  the L
 
.uth to that.
 There is generally some truth to everything,  isn't there.
 I

gets tiring to have to say that every time,  but there always is SOr

of
 
Jevml.:prnent didn't take much of an active part.
 They had quite a lot on thc
 
Iates already because another large scale development during the 50 years wc
.
 
:
.
me considering was the almost daily announcement of new technologies.
 Each
 
vent ion promising wider and more accurate coverage of every possible k
ind
 
c
nan behavior.
 Remember,  in the 1940s even tape recorders were not yet
 
4
ide use.
 They were very specialized p
ieces of equipment then,  and few f
ie.
 
orkers routinely even took still cameras along with them.
 Think of how har
 
:
t is to find photographs of folklorists i
n the field from that period.
 
a
r
iii ly,  for instance,  we used the camera for i
ts earliest funct i o n,
 for
 
portraiture,  rather than documentation.
 Everybody would l
ine up or the f
cc
 
porch and you would take a family p
icture.
 There are no p
ictures of my fat
 
i
nterviewing anybody, we never thought of doing that.
 But World War I
I,  ha
 
n
i  the heels of the brilliant work of the FFA photography projects,  accustc
 
the American public to excellent photographic coverage of almost any kind
 
human activity.
 The universe of recorded sound advanced l
ight years in I
 
ccuracy and scope of i
ts capacities during the years after the war,  and
 
rapturing of motion i
tself moved into a world of new possibilities with I
 
:
I
evelopmer
it of television and eventually the camcorder and similar portaL
 
cameras.
 All of these things evolved and burgeoned during the past 50
 
Tuch a short time,  and indeed this u
nending stream of inventions cha;;:.
 
t
 h
 inf
l5.
 
In an earlier talk this year I pointed out that the increased use of
 
:
hle recording machine by folk song collectors led in part by my doub
 
r
ather and my i
nnovative brother had alone shifted the entire emphasis of
 
olklore scholarship from the song as the cultural artifact to the perfc
 
'
s an event,  and the performers as artists.
 ?? roared off the page via t
 
ecording,  bringing the humanity of the singers and the excitement of the
 
:
.
ccasion with them.
 One
 t help l
istening and what had been remotr
 
intellectually exciting became immediate and visceral. And so the singers
 
began t o  seem more i
mportant and interesting than the product he or she
 .
 
working with; the song.
 As academics began to turn away from ballad traces,
 
10  too the buying public stopped p
iling more books of folk song collections
 
op of the piano and started record collections.
 The world of popular r
i
1usi
 
rhowed exactly the same shift.
 I recall buying pop song word sheets as a
 
teenager at the five-and-dime every week.
 We would all rush down and get
 
latest leaflet of pop songs,  because I l
ike my other teenage friends w
z
 
r
.rn that we
' s bit oarade scnq,  and I wanted to sing i

is that were sung were l

But every new documentary invention resulted ir
 
obtained and clearly recorded or pictured data.  First scholars and thei
 
rchives began to fall behind in the most elementary tasks of accessioning arc
 
atalog i
 ng.
 Interviews went untran
iscri bed,  tunes unn
iotated.
 Fi l
m
, especi a
 
'
ideotape,  unedited,  all not even inspected.
 Joe Wilson's gentle warning
 
e believed that God must have called more people to make documentary f
ilc
 
to sit and look at them,  could have been equally applied to the
 
F folk and traditional music,  especially the new CDs that could i
 
forever.
 Even academics weren't making much sense out of all tho
 
ccumulated piles of human creativity.
 Two contrasting scholarly
 
:aveloped,  one group steadfastly continuing to increase the pool
 
nformat ion by including ever more sectors of the population,  espE
 
hite -collar and urban folks,  not to mention the vast increase in resea

,I
to previously somewhat neglected areas such as traditional visual art:.
 
-afts,  food ways,  agricultural practices and other non-verbal genres.
 The :
 
i
s so much new work to do i
t was hard to f
ind time to analyze the results of
 
t
he findings.
 On the other hand,  still other scholars were busily ar
inourc'
 
—at the great age of collecting was now over.
 We've done all that.
 The
 
•asn' t anything nearly important left to be done in that l
ine and folklc
iri
 
nould now turn their attention exclusively to problems of critical analysiE.
 
E:me issues of the Journal of American Folklore be

But history kept on happening.
 I
t never e

r
iply public folklore.
 After sc
mrne early experiments,  the major federa
 
;stitutions,  the Smithsonian,  the Library of Congress and the Arts En
idc mie
 
hacame involved,  and during the next decade public folklore programs p
:ppE
 
Cc'0SS  the country in almost every state and territory.
 Like most ncr
 
.
.
.
:
.ier
iients,  public folklore began and still continues in a half- world
 
r
iewhere between suspicion and hope.
 I
t often appears neither schol
 
Cugh for the academic nor relaxed enough for cultural activists.
 Certa
 
folklorists who have taken jobs in this part of the f
ield ccnt.irua '
 
rd fraught with both possibilities and myths.
 They may completely burr
 
nd they often do,  but ??,  and they have chan ged the f
ield of f
clh1.
 
I
t will never be the same as i
t was.
 
To g i v e  y
o u  o
n e  quick example,  public f
c
 
i ited with brand new immigrant populations that most of us had ba
 
'card of.
 Many of them include the particular society's most important
 
'raditional artists.
 Artists who have migrated here in part because of the
 
ope that at least their art form,  if not their entire culture might not ju:':
 
;
urvive,  but thrive in our more open artistic climate.
 The American dream K

Inside or outside academia,  folklorists have certainly been busy these past
 
years trying to cope i

i

 And these days we seem super busy,  going in a

Ik1•:rists do,  anyway?"  And a Colorado folklorist friend said,  sc
'meI
 
;
earily,  "Well to begin with we spend a lot of time telling people wha
 
:
'
lklorists do."  But after the last,  i
t didn't take anyone of us more
 
:ree sentences to satisfy the nice lady who had asked the question,  a:
 
'
urtherrnore she approved of our answers.
 She understood us quickly,  an ,
_
'
 
t
hought what we were up to was worth doing,  and really,  most people these
 
j
ays,  do.
 You and I know,  though,  that things are actually more cor
nplicatE
 
:
r
id difficult,  but what we are doing is okay.
 Indeed, 50 years ago i
t woult
 
ve been sensational,  but today i
t often .
just isn't great.
 Really,  i
t oft€:
 
Sr
i' t up to the stature of our material, our subjects.
 Our scholarly studi
 
'
:n' t seem to have reached into the hearts and minds of many other academic:
 
;
;uch less everyday folks we might hope are thrilled.
 We aren't really,  as
 
iscip1ir
ie,  in the mainstream,  and doggone i
t,  we ought to be.  Especially 11
 
1bar
iy, and i
n Washington,  where we have made many strides,  but where we st:
 
end to be thought of as a decoration,  when you think of after the real iss
 
have been resolved.  From the point of the view of the art world,  folk arts
 
pproved of and l
ifted and g
lowed over for evermore.
 But they somehow dc
 
u
ite seem to have the stature or the dignity or downright inevitability
 
he real f
ine arts,  and from the point of view of the humanities world
 
:
lklore scholarship is not as often as i
t ought to be i
n the promir
 
n
ie of the social sciences or anywhere else.
 And I will agree that.
 
wadays,  the general public watchword is what always put us up therc
 
i
e whole parade,  multiculturalism.
 This brave term has been in trc
'ub
 
most from the first moment anybody ever said i
t.
 I
t has been picked
 
Thcked at and misconstrued and redefined and overworked and used to cover
 
l
titude of totally contradictory activities,  u
ntil the poor thing is pri.
 
i
c
'se to hanging on the ropes.
 But I think we ought to be careful before w
.

 I believe

rrnula represents a kind of wide and quite new general acceptance,  a
 
l

ir

:
- -out multiculturalism and each one working from absolutely opposite points
 
ew.
 For one group,  the social conservatives, have the perception that the
 
:
:r
iir
iionality of the English language has weakened in the United States.
 Th:t
 
-
m
i
g
r
a
tion is continuing absolutely without check and that the melting
 
:
inciple is no longer working.
 All together theirs is a truly fearsomc
 
pcture of potential national dissolution and i
t deserves careful analysis
 
pert treatm ent.
 I don't pretend to be able to do this but I think i
t is a:
 
sue that must be drawn to our attention and i
t must be dealt with i
n more
 
'
ect ways than we've been doing.
 I think we've been skirting this bunch  ;
f
 
i
jiks,  we've been a l
ittle scared of them.
 One small possibility for easing
 
:eir fears might be to consider coc
iptir
ig our multicultural banner,  and
 
offensive for a change,  regularly and calmly,  i
ncluding in our rhetoric
 
L C  fact the most of the world actually speaks more  than one language,  ar
id
 
i
ll remains true to their own internal identity,  and their own group

ty.
 That many Americans move comfortably in multicultural sit uat I

,

idparents on weekends, talking computerese at the office weekdays,  and
 
ving in their own comfortable African-american
i or Mohawk-american world in

 Why not start suggesting again regularly,  calmly,  comfortably.
.
 
:
.
king i
t part of the national rhetoric that we are mostly all b
i- or t
 
:
.Jtural,  and isn't i
t kind of i
nteresting,  now that we think about i
t
 
i
t isn't really so scary.
 Folklore which has always deeply concerna
 
h both s
tability and charge is i
n a particularly st rong  positio

r ry as f

Tthough the 100% americans feel under attack these days,  so do many small
 
oups,  tribes,  ethnicities, that are desperately trying to maintain their
 
.
A
itural individualities.
 If they only could be quite sure what they are a
r
 
to go about finding the l
ittle pieces that have inevitably gotten lost c
 
cved away.
 This is exactly the opposite point of view of the 100% America -n:.
 
would urge you that such dis.jur
ectures are a standard state of affairs i
n t.:
 
f
l-i
erican body politic.
 We can get all upset when we know i
t's something 1
i
 
'
his but part of our systems genius is in i
ts capacities to contain tot 1
 
pposites.
 However we must remember that small groups feel a special ac
 
articular and different angst and fear,  because for them so much of thc.i
 
'istory is carried in the memories of their fragile elders,  and without
 
organized history,  they tend to feel negligible,  uncounted and weY-
gain perhaps the world of folklore might take up the offensive.  I
n to
 
p
lace we must always inquire from the older folks what and where the
 
i
dest ideas and materials are.
 These deep structures are the wellspring f
.
 
hich everything else flows,  and they must be respectfully recognized ad
 
a
iled upon to appropriate attention.
 I
've been bothered recently by
 
:aalizin
ig that the current folkloric preoccupation with product,  frcrr
 
'astivals to books to recordings to craft sales,  where everything we d
:
 
ave an immediate outcome,  spurred almost entirely,
 afraid,  by the
 
,
canting system.
 This preoccupation with product is making many field workc s
 
look f
irst of all to those culture bearers who are already preserving their
 
:
c
'rk in public.
 Local orchestras who p
lay for weddings for instance,  story
 
:
allers who have already been in the public l
ibrary,  craft workers who are
 
aady for market and have things they are really not ready to sell.
 We
 
hereby too often are unable to get around to the small home traditions,  the
 
h
ew,  developing,  not yet ready for prime time artists.
 Most significantly th
 
tradition bearers who may never choose to appear i
n public in any f
 
Part of our 50 years coming up might well be spent doing just th,
 
T Y.
 information back to the folks.
 Culturally appropriate methods
 
r
'ansrnissior
i and storage are often easy at hand.
 When I worked in the
 
.
r
'ts program I was once visited by a delegation of basket makers from

T
here is a lot of loose talk these days about power and folklorists
 
e
r
i
ied to have taken power away from or bestowed i
t upon various groups,
 
though power could be plopped on or scraped off someone's plate l
ike a
 
poon
iful of mashed potatoes.
 This entire topic will be addressed later cr,
 
:
day by a panel,  I believe.
 I hope they will include in their deliberations
 
few truisms.
 For one,  knowledge really is power,  and we should think a lot
 
.out that.
 I remember when folklorists wouldn't ever talk at all except just
 
say what song do you know,  to any folks because they were afraid if they
 
go of any of their information i
t would spoil the singer.
 I could evs;
 
l
l you the names,  privately.
 A second truism,  is that no cultural actic
 -
 
'
he result of another single action.
 We must abandon this l
inear style of
 
inkir
ig.
 There are always multiple occurrences that bring about and a
lts
 
ery event.  My view is that folklorists can bring useful information ar
 
.periences to cultural activities in which they will i
nevitably be en.j H
 
;
any other people with their own useful information and experiences,  th:
 
:
ntire enterprise taking p
lace within the overall context of an incredib >
 
:
tent group of outside i
nfluences,  from national media competitions to iocc
 
:
:
:lice regulations.
 We are always,  whether we choose to recognize i
t or not
 
rt of a team.
 We'd rather advertise folklore and folk culture,  and folk
 
udies as the source of information on any cultural problem and now  hc:r
 
-
ave chickens are flying home to roost.
 Most of us who are k
nown as
 
'
lklorist get asked u
nanswerable questions everyday and we are thrown lit
 
-
 cient cultural battles without a by your leave.
 We are expected to
 
.
:st elegantly refined opinions about l
iterally hundreds of art forms c
r
 
ccial problems.
 Nobody knows that much,  but we ought to try.  We must
 
-
 '
ntin
ivally educate ourselves,  we folklorists,  i
ndeed,  we must demand to bo
 
ucated better.
 Besides reading and l

Dear Lynn:
 
I really apologize for the  length of the accompanying paper.
 
I can only plead that  I did cut  it and it  just keeps on
 
growing.  Who was  it  (Oscar Wilde?)  who apologized for writing
 
such a long letter "because  I do not have the time to compose
 
a short one"? That's me.
 
I have marked several cuts that  seem possible on the at
 
mss,  but  I fear they will only save a page.  I also can
 
usually snip out a page's worth of unnecessary words f
 
most of my writing if  I sit back and edit  just to that e
r
 
and I' ve not done that yet with this thing. (For example the
 
phrases  in parentheses on pages  5 and 6 could perhaps come
 
out without  loss of clarity.)  I will have no particular
 
difficulty in doing this kind of picky-picky  (wiki-wiki?)
 
editing during my Texas visit or even before,  but right now I
 
need some  indication from you as to whether or not this
 
entire approach fits  in with your overall vision.  It's your
 
book,  you know,  really.
 
Please don't hesitate to show this around to Wendell or Rick
 
or Barbara or whoever else.  I' ve run it by Dan and Terry Liu
 
but  in a slightly earlier version,  and it's awfully easy for
 
mis-statements to creep in when you' re trying to be concise.
 
For that  reason,  I' d as  soon you didn't give anybody else a
 
copy for keeps;  people sometimes get very sloppy about
 
quoting and if they're going to quote  I want to be sure  I
' ve
 
gotten it as right as  I can.
 
One other slight problem.  I thought  I would like  (at the  *  on
 
page  6
)  to reference Alan's Folk Song Style and Culture;  most
 
of the ideas in this paper are his or I' ve discussed them
 
with him at various times.  However,  I thought you might want
 
to keep the footnotes  isolated in a particular place -
-
however you want to handle  it.  Also,  I haven't had time to
 
talk with Ric about whether there is a general book on the
 
music of the Pacific that  should be referenced there as well;
 
Dan doesn't know ofa really good one nor do  I.
 
I'll call you tomorrow or Wednesday when you' ve had a chance
 
to look this over.  Feel quite free to criticize;  I can always
 
use this  somewhere else if it doesn't work for you.  And I
 
enjoyed working on it.
 Love always,
 
A FEW IDEAS FOR TEACHERS:
 4/11/94
 
In the varied classrooms of Hawaii,  how to make "Musics
 
of Hawaii"--
 this remarkable collection of diverse sounds,
 
impeccable research and deeply moving performances -
-
 cor
n
 
alive to the everyday student may at first  seem a f
 
undertaking.  However,  it can be predicted with total
 
confidence that every teacher and every listener,  chila o

adult,  will find somewhere  in these tapes at  least one piece
 
of music that  is memorable,  haunting,  and personally
 
evocative.  Conversely,  each one of the performances on these
 
tapes will sound like home to someone.  A little exploration
 
here,  and you will find your own particular piece or pieces
 
within the larger picture of the many musics of Hawaii.
 
The harder part  is to learn how to follow one's friends
 
and neighbors into their music.  Musical  literacy is not
 
really especially helpful on this  journey,  and a lack of such
 
training should never disqualify a teacher from using these
 
materials.  The enclosed Essays on each cultural group will
 
open many doors.  But there are also some broad ideas and
 
perspectives that may prove helpful  in planning how to
 
approach the entire project.
 
More than 50,000 years ago, mankind embarked on perhaps
 
the greatest of all human adventures -
-
 the exploration of
 
Oceania,  during which generation after generation of voyagers
 
carried human beings onto almost every one of the myriad
 
islands  scattered throughout the Pacific.  But these voyagers
 
were not  just explorers or tradesmen,  they were settlers as
 
well.  A great many of them stayed in the places they came to
 
and began to make new lives according to the new
 
circumstances they found.  Over the centuries,  the peopling of
 
the Pacific made an unparalleled contribution to the great
 
human reference  library of things that had never been in
 
existence before,  creating an enormous number of new
 
'
L
_  L
_-  .S
 
instruments,  choral styles,  the whole range of things and
 
special ways to do things that make people human.  The raging
 
creativity of this region  is one of the first points that
 
must be emphasized.
 
Nowadays there are  few uninhabited places  left on  earth,
 
and
 
almost
 
nowhere where no one has ever been.  But the human
 
impulse to explore continues
 
of peoples
 
in
 
over all the earth's
 
sometimes pushed.  Indeed,  it  is
 
the ever-restless  journeying
 
surface,  sometimes pulled and
 
almost  impossible now to find
 
a place where only one kind of people live,  for so many
 
travellers  still go on wanting to settle down in the places
 
to which they have come.  And after a while they bring their
 
families and friends  in too. F he se days,  Robinson Crusoe
 
would probably find himself co-habiting his  island not  just
 
with Friday but with the entire Friday family and their
 
married-in relatives besides.
 
No matter where we live today,  then,  we are always
 
neighbored by people of different backgrounds,  ideas,
 
experiences,  and know-how,  for no traveller has ever arrived
 
anywhere empty-handed.  Each new settler has  learned as a
 
child the repertory of hand and mind skills essential to
 
being whoever he or she is,  and these particular skills then
 
become developed,  amplified,  twisted into other shapes,
 
combined,  passed on,  or forgotten,  as new circumstances
 
dictate.  And when other new peoples arrive,  everybody -
-
natives and old-family-newcomers and absolutely-new-newcomers
 
alike -
-
 has to get busy learning how to accommodate to the
 
new situation.
 
This whole process has been going on for so many
 
thousands of years that one would think that the human
 
species would have caught on to the hang of it by now,  and it
 
would be considered the normal state of affairs.  Not so.  We
 
worry and complain about the results of human migrations  in a
 
thousand guises.  We worry about  cultural purity,  we worry
 
about the economic impact of tourism and immigration,  about
 
multi-culturalism,  about political,  social and cultural
 
equity.  There are even times when all this migrating around
 
is thought to be entirely negative in result,  and regulations
 
and laws  are concocted to prevent  it.  They never  seem to work
 
for  long.
 
We may have to reconsider the entire  issue.  It may turn
 
out,  indeed,  that the next great human adventures will not be
 
geographic but  spiritual -
-
 voyages  into the mysteries of
 
people-to-people contact.  Instead of discovering new places
 
to move to,  we may need to discover new levels of stimulation
 
and excitement at home.  How varied groups of humans can live
 
peaceably as neighbors  is a question for which we do not yet
 
know the answers.  How can differences be relished and enjoyed
 
instead of resented? How can this particular odd behavior be
 
overlooked  (or at  least tolerated,  as  in any family)  in view
 
of the amusing,  lovely or useful other thing those folks do?
 
And here  is where art becomes important,  indeed vital.
 
Almost all art  is a form of public statement,  and when an
 
artistic practice is  common to a particular group of people,
 
it generally is designed to represent not only their especial
 
ideas of beauty but what they most  like to display about
 
themselves,  the best  foot that they have to put forward.  Even
 
an unfamiliar art  form can become an area in which
 
explanations can lead to understandings,  and understandings
 
to friendships,  because most people feel intuitively that art
 
is a non-threatening area,  infinitely less  sensitive a forum
 
for contact than politics or economics.
 
Music is especially important  in this kind of cultural
 
interaction because it  is not language-based and can
 
therefore cross  cultural barriers with greater ease. ,
[ I
nde ed
 
some people have suggested that,  as more and more migrations
 
mix peoples together in ever more complex relationships,
 
music might possibly become a kind of world language.  Perhaps
 
there is a kind of international multicultural music just
 
waiting to be invented,  through which everyone on earth could
 
sing the  same  songs together.  A great many composers of what
 
is  sometimes called "world music" are actively searching for
 
such a new way of communicating.
 
One  is reminded,  though,  of the saying that you must be
 
careful what you pray for because you may get it.  It  is not
 
clear that a uniform communication model such as a "world
 
music" would survive what  seems to be the universal desire of
 
humans to be different,  special to themselves.
 
A wise old instrumentalist once remarked,  when asked if
 
he wouldn't  like to play a particular musical style from
 
another school,  "Oh yes.  I would love to be able to play that
 
way,  and then not do it." He was not being ironic or
 
scornful;  he meant his remark quite literally.  He wanted to
 
be able to play this new technique,  but he wanted to use any
 
such added skill to improve the music he already played.  The
 
question of  just exactly what a musician plays and how a
 
singer uses her vocal chords  is not simply a question of
 
technical agility;  it  is primarily a matter of cultural
 
identification informed by personal taste.
 
It  is worth noting that as peoples have roamed about the
 
world,  carrying with them various highly developed musical
 
styles and repertoires,  both the new and the old musics often
 
continue to persevere  side by side.  Co-existence does not
 
necessarily lead to the kind of all-out competition where one
 
music wins and the other is never heard of again;  musics can
 
and usually do co-exist  in a kind of relative balance.  Their
 
interactions can also lead to new musical inventions.
 
Occasionally an explosion of human creativity at particular
 
cultural crossroads has produced an entirely new kind of
 
music.  Jazz  is the standard example,  though one can cite
 
dozens of others  including the still-evolving Polynesian
 
"himeni"  (hymns)
 
It may be useful to utilize the musics on this album to
 
demonstrate to older students a fundamental analytical
 
principle announced by an anthropologist many years ago:
 
Every human being is  like all other human beings  in
 
some ways:  (e. g.  in biological or physiological needs);
 
Every human being is  like some other human beings  in
 
some ways:  (e.g.  speaking the same language);  and
 
Every human being is  like no other human being in
 
some ways;  (e. g.  identical twins do not share exactly the
 
same cluster of  individual experiences and personality
 
traits)
 
This plain-spoken and extraordinarily useful  formula,
 
which co-ordinates the approaches of the biological/physical
 
sciences,  the social  sciences,  and the psychological
 
sciences,  can be applied to many things besides human beings.
 
It  is certainly helpful when considering music.
 
Every musical performance can be discussed in any or all
 
of the fore-going ways.  At the first level  (every music is
 
like all other musics  in some ways)  students can be helped to
 
discover by experimentation the  fascinating physical
 
properties of sound,  for there is no music without  sound,
 
there is no sound without vibrations occuring at a range and
 
speed suitable to the ear,  and there are no vibrations
 
without movement.  Proving the truth of this  statement
 
requires action  (always a delightful event  for children) : a
 
vocal chord or a column of air in a trumpet or conch shell
 
has to be  set vibrating by a breath,  or a string by a
 
plucking finger,  a drum-head by a hand or a stick,  a metal
 
plate by a mallet.
 
At the second or cultural  level, (every music is  like
 
some other musics  in some ways)  students can begin a
 
lifetime's exploration of the fact that although the physical
 
laws of sound are universal,  every group of people has
 
always,  because of a complex of geographical,  historical and
 
cultural  factors,  emphasized and elaborated certain musical
 
sounds and played down and even eliminated others.  These
 
combinations of group aesthetic choices are usually called
 
musical style,  and they are due to the infinite intertwining
 
of geographical,  historical and cultural factors that each
 
group of people has experienced.  Certain scholars have been
 
exploring these areas  for many years.'
 
Finally at the third level, (every music is  like no other
 
music in some ways)  we confront the artist,  the remarkable
 
individual human being who has both comprehended and
 
incorporated the physical and cultural  levels  (1 and 2
)
 
into the act of making music in such a personal and private
 
way that an experienced  (educated)  ear can often tell  just
 
which particular singer or instrumentalist  is giving a
 
particular performance.  Most of the time,  most artists are
 
working within the cultural style their particular group has
 
developed,  but  some few will be playing about on the outer
 
edges of that  style,  pushing the rules a bit,  adding
 
something new.  It  is  a daring role and an important
 
responsibility.
 
In the schoolroom,  the second  (cultural)  level is
 
probably the one at which these tapes  can best be enjoyed and
 
discussed,  for the cross-cultural exposure they provide is
 
possibly their most  important gift.  When thinking about this,
 
it  is useful to bear in mind that all the musics  included on
 
these tapes,  even those of relatively recent  immigrant
 
groups,  have been in active existence for a very long time.
 
Present day listeners,  especially the young,  are all too
 
completely adapted to novelty,  to rapid change,  to the very
 
latest thing.  They tend to dismiss  lightly anything that  is
 
not  in current  fashion.
 
Age,  however,  must be respected,  for the "test of time"
 
has always provided us with art of enduring value.  One does
 
not dismiss purely as  "old stuff" either an ancient Hawaiian
 
sacred mele or an eighteenth century string quartet,  for
 
generations of music makers have poured their creative
 
energies  into these sounds,  and generations of careful
 
listeners have  selected them to remember and ask for again
 
and again,  so that they have survived the centuries and now
 
reward our privileged ears.
 
Some of the sounds on these tapes,  however,  are
 
completely opposite from those we may have been taught  are
 
appropriate for music-making.  Those of us  from Polynesian
 
backgrounds,  for example,  may feel that the human throat
 
should be open and the vocal chords  should vibrate widely for
 
the most  "beautiful"  sound to be produced.  Those from Asian
 
backgrounds,  on the contrary,  may find that  "beauty" lies  in
 
the voice when it  is at  its most  intense -
-
 narrow and pure,
 
uniform in color and volume,  disembodied,  piercingly
 
emotional.  Some orchestras,  also,  are composed largely of
 
metal gongs  (Indonesian gamelans),  some of struck membranes
 
(
Polynesian drum choirs),  some of bowed strings  (European
 
symphonies) .
 Each group may feel the other is a bit bizarre,
 
even a bit non-musical.
 
But  it  is not necessary that we  "like" the music of our
 
neighbors and our friends.  Our lives will be enriched if we
 
can simply learn to consider and savor these musics and these
 
unfamiliar styles,  looking for their particular qualities and
 
their especial reasons  for being.  It's a little like learning
 
to enjoy a new food;  the first olive may be distasteful but
 
repeated and varied exposure may very well produce a gourmet.
 
Careful attentive listening and re-listening is the primary
 
solution to appreciating those new musics that may at  first
 
seem totally unapproachable.  Learning about the music is
 
another route to appreciation;  the strangeness of a
 
particular set of sounds may prove to be because it was
 
created for a purpose particular to a time or place or people
 
that we are not  familiar with.  The more we learn,  the more we
 
will understand,  the more we will enjoy.
 
Careful listening is a heavy labor,  though,  and teachers
 
may be surprised to find that many students rarely engage in
 
it,  even though they may be continuously surrounded by sound,
 
from the Muzak  in the grocery store to their own personal
 
Walkmans.  Some  children even study to music,  using it as a
 
sound baffle to block out  casual  interruptions and ambient
 
noise.  Some such listeners have come to regard hearing music
 
-
-
 any music -
-
 as a signal to start doing something else -
-
anything else,  Learning to pay strict attention to the music
 
only,  may be a new and complex experience,  one that varies  in
 
intensity according to whether the particular music is
 
unfamiliar or not.
 
Another good way of learning about music is to try one's
 
hand at the making of it,  though there are a few cautions
 
necessary here.  Traditional music is often thought of as
 
"simple" and something that  "everyone can  join in on" and
 
indeed almost every culture has a repertoire of musical
 
activities especially for children -
-
 singing or clapping
 
games,  for example -
-
 as well as a repertoire of social,
 
perhaps party-time,  songs that are intended for everyone,
 
skilled and unskilled.  But overall,  we find that all musical
 
systems require dedicated,  well trained,  and highly
 
experienced artists  in order for their true values to sound
 
out  clear,  and it  is unwise to suggest to children that
 
making some people's music requires effort while other
 
people's does not.  Cultural respect and tact enter in here;
 
for some classes,  learning a childrens  song from another
 
culture may be a good idea,  or singing together songs  like
 
"Hawaii Aloha",  in situations where group participation is
 
desired.  Investigating and practicing good multi-cultural
 
audience manners could provide another useful perspective.
 
Musicians  from certain cultures  like to have audiences  clap
 
along and interject  shouts of approval,  while others prefer a
 
respectful silence;  whistling may mean pleasure or dislike
 
depending upon the particular culture;  and everyone can learn
 
a complimentary phrase in another language.
 
Be comforted that most chidren,  both younger and older,
 
really like music and have thought about  it to a greater or
 
03
 
lesser extent on their ow
 A4
1
-4- most schoolrooms are multi-
cultural,  so that although some of the musical styles
 
included on these tapes may be unfamiliar to a particular
 
teacher,  they may be very comfortable,  even "down-home",  to
 
individual class members.  In fact,  certain students might be
 
pleased to act as class  "experts"  in the music of their own
 
backgrounds.
 
It  is also possible that particular students may have
 
relatives who are well acquainted with  (or practitioners of)
 
musics  included in these tapes;  it  is always exciting to
 
invite real musicians  in for demonstration and inspiration.
 
These are  fine tapes and well recorded,  but  for lasting
 
memories,  there  is nothing like living sound and living
 
musicians.  There may also be students  in class who come from
 
musical backgrounds that are not  included in these tapes;
 
this could provide an exciting opportunity for research and
 
amassing new information.  Put all the musics  in. It  is a
 
multi-cultural world we live in,  and the Golden Rule for a
 
multi-cultural world is to make  sure that every single group,
 
no matter how tiny,  gets  some time and some recognition.
 
I believe that the teacher who has the opportunity to
 
use these remarkable tapes  in the classroom has a great
 
opportunity to educate in the original sense of the term -
-
to help lead students out of ways of thinking that are no
 
longer fruitful,  to open up new visions and new
 
possibilities.  Of course,  there are tricks to the trade.  A
 
few ideas  follow,  that can be dressed up or down according to
 
the age of the  students and the  focus of the class.  There are
 
hundreds more.
 
1
)  Experiment with body slapping  (cf.  "Sasa" the
 
Samoan seated dance) .
 The human anatomy is  charmingly
 
variegated in pitch possibilities.  Try the difference between
 
slapping the forehead and the upper arm and the thigh.  Which
 
is higher in pitch,  which lower?
 Childrens'  clapping games
 
in many cultures emphasize these tonal possibilities.  Do any
 
of your students know any such games? Here is a case where
 
some music-making could be very educational;  for example,  see
 
if an entire class could play a familiar clapping game
 
exactly together on the beat.  It  really is hard,  and trying
 
it  out will add to the class'  appreciation of the  "Sasa".
 
Oceania is an area where percussion is generally
 
important;  there are many different kinds of drums.  Some drum
 
traditions emphasize pitch variation,  as  in body slappina;
 
some
 
feature rhythmic variation an
 
complexity.  In listening to these tapes,  the relative
 
importance of various types of percussion is observable and
 
comparable between cultural  styles.  This could interest older
 
students,  who might also look into the relationship of the
 
availability of natural materials and local musical
 
instruments  in particular places.  The wide variety of
 
percussion instruments  in the Pacific is in part a function
 
of whether or not a particular island can support  forests,
 
bamboo stands,  shell beaches,  coconut groves.
 
2)  The human voice not only produces beautiful musical
 
tones;  when words are added,  it  sends messages.  The function
 
of song as poetry or literary communication can be explored
 
on many levels beginning with the simple personal  statement
 
of the lullaby or the  lament  (
the Molokai song)  and
 
continuing to the larger mythological accounts of the affairs
 
of the gods or the voyages of heroes.
 
It  is of real importance that the songs on these
 
tapes be utilized not only in music classes but  in history,
 
literature and current affairs classes as well.  The testimony
 
of popular belief which is  contained in the songs that people
 
make up to sing about events,  is actually part of the
 
historical record.  It tells us what people felt at the time
 
about what happened,  and even if they may have gotten it a
 
bit wrong,  their views may prove to be of ultimate
 
significance in terms of what happened next.
 
3
)  The qualities that make up musical  style can be
 
considered even on the primary level.  Some singers  sing on
 
one pitch for one syllable;  others in many different pitches,
 
swooping the voice up and down using only one syllable.
 
"A
 
a
 
a
 
a
 
a
 men!" This effect has a pretty name,  "melisma",
 
and some peoples seem to like to sing melismatically and
 
emphasize  it  in their vocal style while others do not.
 
Similarly some singers may like to sing a particular note and
 
decorate  it with trills or little slidings up or down,  or
 
perhaps they don't.  The important thing is to recognize that
 
these effects tend to be emphasized or not emphasized by
 
singers not  just because of their own individual feelings but
 
because of the general preferences of their own group.  In
 
other words,  most people in their home audience like to hear
 
their songs their own special culturally approved way.
 
It  can be a fascinating exercise to list the ways  in
 
which one performing group or one musical style differs  from
 
or is  similar to another.  Each performing group in these
 
tapes  shares certain stylistic characteristics with some of
 
the other groups and is quite different  from others;
 
comparing two or three in terms of frequency of vocal
 
ornamentation
 r use of melisma
would be an interesting
 
analytical project  for older children.  It would also provide
 
a perspective that may encode a crucial point for students of
 
any age who can thereby learn to think of other groups not as
 
"those people who make those funny noises"
 
people who generally sing one at a time in
 
people who mostly like to sing harmony all
 
but as  "those
 
turn" or "those
 
together at the
 
same time," or "the ones who generally decorate the notes"
 
and "the ones who generally don't".  More technical terms for
 
musical description are of course,  preferable,  but have not
 
been used in this essay in order to reinforce the point that
 
a standard musical education is not essential for teachers
 
who wish to use these tapes  in the everyday classroom.
 
These tapes are tools.  They are of themselves excellent
 
in quality and therefore can be used without  fear,  without
 
any of the preceding suggestions or ideas being put  into
 
effect.  Just having this music around,  being played every
 
once in a while,  taking its place in the school's overall
 
atmosphere,  will,  as Dr.  Trimillos points out in his
 
introduction,  have a positive effect.
 
But  just as a particular artist,  alone  in his quest to
 
amplify and extend his group's particular tradition,  may not
 
be successful-- that  is,  his or her audience may not approve
 
of the particular preferences exemplified in the work -
-
 a
 
teacher may find that a particular musical tradition is not
 
enjoyed by particular students.  This is no tragedy,  indeed it
 
is normal.  And it  is appropriate,  I believe,  to raise such
 
issues,  especially with older children,  from time to time.
 
They,  as well as we teachers can use some perspective,  and it
 
may be important  for all of us to consider that,  as many
 
scientists believe,  there can be no such thing as failure,
 
there are only actions with either positive or negative
 
results.  With either,  something useful has been learned.
 
So be of good heart.  Play these remarkable tapes;
 
delight  in their variety,  and be proud of the complexity and
 
depth of the artistic resources that mark the beautiful state
 
of Hawaii.
 
I wish you  joy in this new adventure.

m ovi n g on i

S
tylistically, Texas c

azzier and more
 
improvisational. The very t

NOTE ON THE AGENDA
 
Our mission is threefold:
 (
1) to outline the current situation, needs, and
 
concerns in the public sector endeavor;  (
2) to think creatively about, and
 
recommend, the kinds of educational programs and experiences that will benefit
 
this endeavor; and,  (
3) to identify and plan a program that can be developed
 
under the terms of the current grant.  We have proposed the agenda to help us
 
accomplish that in five working-group sessions and a follow-up assessment with
 
Pat Jasper.  We expect to refine the agenda in response to our discussions.
 
We are asking Dan Sheehy and Bess Hawes to open the discussions because it is
 
largely their ideas and concerns that have brought us thus far.  Very briefly,
 
the background is the following:  Last year, after learning that special funds
 
for education might be available through NEA's Folk Arts Program, Bess Hawes
 
initiated discussions with a number of people around the country--including
 
George Holt and Beverly Patterson at the NC Arts Council--about the
 
possibility of creating some institute-like opportunities for folk arts
 
coordinators and others working in the public sector.  Bess felt the field
 
could use the kind of stimulation she herself had experienced in a summer
 
institute.
 Folklife Section staff at the Arts Council in Raleigh and faculty
 
from the Curriculum in Folklore at the University of North Carolina in Chapel
 
Hill all proved receptive to exploring the idea with her.
 In consultation
 
with Bess, we reached a consensus that the wisest course would be to gather a
 
few highly experienced and articulate public sector and academic folklorists
 
who could bring a greater variety of perspectives to the discussion and
 
planning of such a project than we could muster locally.  With funding from
 
NEA Folk Arts and some additional support from the University of North
 
Carolina, we have been able to invite you to join us in what we hope will be a
 
lively, thoughtful, and productive gathering.
 
We have not asked anyone else to prepare a paper or a talk, but will ask you
 
to think about what kinds of educational opportunities you would like to see
 
for those working in the public sector.
 To focus the discussion somewhat, we
 
want to pose two related questions in advance and ask titdre Evans-Pritchard,
 
Jim Leary, John Roberts, Nick Spitzer, Amy Skillman, and Elaine Thatcher to
 
respond to them on Friday afternoon.
 
First, taking a cue from Bess Hawes, could you draw on your own
 
experience, observation, or imagination and briefly describe a program,
 
event, seminar, or other experience that you think has potential as an
 
educational "model" (in both the way it is carried out and its subject
 
area) for invigorating professional folklorists and others working in
 
the public sector?
 
Second, would you reflect upon what those working in the field
 
(
including those with professional training or experience in folklore,
 
community scholars, and others) need to know in order to perform their
 
work in the public sector?

PROJECT NARRATIVE:
 SUMMER INSTITUTE FOR FOLK ARTS WORKERS
 
PURPOSE 
This project seeks a two-year $40,000 grant to initiate a series of
 
summer institutes at the University of North Carolina for Folk Arts Specialists
 
and others working on behalf of the folk arts and artists in the United States.
 
The  first  phase  (1994)  will  be  a conference  charged  with both  review  and
 
planning.  In the review, conference participants will evaluate current public-
sector programs and activities on behalf of the folk arts (many of which were
 
funded by NEA), exploring their historical development and inherent problems,
 
assessing  their  current  needs,  and  considering  educational,  cultural,  and
 
political strategies for developing these programs further.  In conjunction with
 
this review, the conference will develop guidelines and plans for the intensive
 
training  seminars the  institutes  will offer.
 The second phase  (1995)  will
 
initiate the  institutes  on  the UNC  campus.
 In  these  institutes,  selected
 
participants drawn from the ranks of folk-arts specialists will explore timely
 
issues  in  their  field,  and  will  receive  specialized  training  from  invited
 
consultants.
 
BACKGROUND
  
Since its establishment in 1978,  the Folk Arts Program of the National
 
Endowment for the Arts has been instrumental in creating almost all of the state-
based folk-arts programs.  The development of these state programs began with a
 
call to arts agencies to include folk arts specialists on their staffs.  Under
 
the leadership of Bess Lomax Hawes, the Folk Arts Program has met its goal of
 
establishing nationwide an infrastructure for supporting the folk arts.
 
North  Carolina  joined  this  network,  bringing  with  it  a  long  and
 
distinguished record.
 As early as 1930,  the University of North Carolina in
 
Chapel Hill offered  courses  in  folklore.
 By  1940,  Ralph  Steele Boggs had
 
established the UNC Curriculum in Folklore, making it the oldest graduate program
 
in folklore in the United States.  Decades later, as the nation celebrated its
 
bicentennial, the North Carolina Department of Cultural Resources became aware
 
of the talents of a young Duke graduate, George Holt, who had organized highly
 
successful public festivals and programs celebrating the state's folk heritage.
 
Holt's entry into the Department in 1977 as director of the newly created Office
 
of Folkilfe Programs gave North Carolina its first state level position for a
 
folklife specialist.  When the Department reorganized in 1981, the Office became
 
part of the NC Arts Council where it acquired a grantsmaking capability and a new
 
name, the Folk i
lfe Section.
 
Under Holt's leadership, the Folklife Section has planned and carried out
 
a wide range of projects in support of the state's folk arts.  Some projects have
 
focused on extensive fieldwork documentation with sound recordings, photographs,
 
film  and  videotape,  and  slides.
 In  other  projects,  the  staff  developed
 
festivals, tours, conferences, concerts, and special programs for public schools.
 
In 1989, the Section initiated the North Carolina Folk Heritage Awards modeled
 
on the National Heritage Fellowship awards created by the NBA Folk Arts Program.
 
Recently,  however,  folk arts specialists in North Carolina,  along with
 
others in the field, have felt increasing pressure to act more creatively and
 
constructively on behalf of folk arts and artists.  The old and dominant models
 
of presentation--festivals, for example--have come under criticism as thoughtful
 
observers question whom they really serve, and question the validity of their
 
presentation of traditional arts and culture.  Yet it is not clear how to replace
 
or improve current models.
 Public folklorists are also feeling pressures to
 
rapidly expand their working  definition of the  "folk arts"  in  an effort to
 
recognize traditional artists and arts--native, ethnic, and i
m migrant--unfamiliar
 
to Americans a decade or two ago.  And, of course, as budgets shrink and all of
 
the arts come under closer public scrutiny, folk arts specialists must be more
 
prepared than ever to justify their programs and to find allies in other fields--
2
 
such as the park service, museums, and agencies for historic preservation.
 In
 
short, those who work on behalf of the folk arts need to become more effective
 
advocates for traditional artists.
 
Such problems have been a matter of concern to many in the field, including
 
the staff of the Folklife Section of the North Carolina Arts Council, other
 
folklorists in the state, and the faculty and students of the UNC Curriculum in
 
Folklore, who have worked in close association for many years.  This association
 
has  produced  a number  of  useful  results,  one  of  the  earliest  being  the
 
establishment of the Folklife Institute in 1974 with the
- assistance of David
 
Whisnant,  who  is  now  a UNC Professor of  English and Folklore.
 In a 1989
 
collaboration, the Curriculum in Folklore and the Folklife Section, with support
 
from the Folklife Institute, planned a highly successful "Sounds of the South"
 
conference to celebrate the opening of UNC's Southern Folklife Collection, which
 
has become a major folk arts resource for the region.
 All folklife documentary
 
grants made by the Folklife Section now carry the stipulation that materials
 
resulting from the grant be deposited in the Collection.
 In other cooperative
 
efforts, George Holt, the Director of the Section, has taught a course in public-
sector folklore for the Curriculum; and Professor Glenn Hinson has released some
 
of his North Carolina field recordings in Eight-Hand Sets and Holy Steps, an LP
 
album produced by the  Section and  selected  by the Library of  Congress  for
 
inclusion  in  its  list  of  outstanding  folk  recordings.
 Since  the  Folklife
 
Section's  summer  intern program began seven years ago,  it has employed five
 
Curriculum  students,  supplementing their  university training with practical
 
experience in the public sector.  Many other Curriculum students have worked on
 
programs and festivals produced by the Folklife Section.
 Curriculum graduates
 
now work in folk arts programs from Massachusetts to Alabama, and Virginia to
 
Wisconsin (see Appendix A for a partial list).
 
How  to  strengthen,  deepen,  and  innovate  public  folk-arts  activities
 
continues to be a topic of discussion between the UNC  faculty and the Arts
 
Council  staff.
 Their  collaboration in  this  new conference  and the ensuing
 
institutes is a natural next step.
 
PLAN OF WORK The need to evaluate the activities undertaken by the state-based
 
programs over the past 15 years, and to set a direction for the next phase of
 
public folk-arts programs, coincides with the needs of folk arts coordinators to
 
re-tool in light of social and cultural changes and conceptual changes in the
 
field of  folklore.
 We  plan  to  meet  these  needs  by  initiating  the  summer
 
institutes in two phases.
 
PHASE I is a five-day planning conference scheduled for August, 1994.
 It
 
will have two distinct and interlocking responsiblities.  First, the group is to
 
evaluate the present status of public-sector work on behalf of the folk arts.
 
We  expect  this  evaluation  to  begin  with  a close  look  at  the  historical
 
development of public programs and at their underlying assumptions, and that it
 
will include an assessment of present needs and problems of the field (
such as
 
its language and rhetoric, its major constituencies, its most common strategies,
 
etc.)  in light of its guiding assumptions.
 We also expect some assessment of
 
potential political and cultural strategies that would explore possibilities for
 
new or stronger partnerships with state and federal agencies (for example, the
 
National  Park  Service,  State  Departments  of  Education,  Rural  Development
 
Councils, and possibly with private groups like historic preservationists).  The
 
second responsibility of the planning conference would be to produce a working
 
document to guide the planning of the 1995 and subsequent training institutes for
 
folk arts coordinators.
 
The planning  conference discussion will  take focus  from three invited
 
papers  to be prepared  in  advance and circulated to participants before the
 
meeting.
 Possible topics include the historical development of public-sector
 
3
 
folk arts programs, the language and rhetoric of "folk" arts, old and new models
 
for folk-arts activities, a non-historical look at the present status of folk
 
arts in American life, and the anticipated cultural and demographic changes in
 
the United States over the next 20 years.
 The topics selected will guide the
 
selection of who is invited to write the papers.  An ad hoc steering comm ittee
 
(
composed of  faculty from the Curriculum in Folklore,  staff of the Folklife
 
Section,  other local folklorists,  and the former chair of the NEA Folk Arts
 
program) is soliciting advice from other colleagues and planning the Conference
 
venue
 
We anticipate inviting approximately twelve working participants to this
 
planning conference.  The steering committee will seek diversity and balance in
 
the working group by selecting participants who will offer a broad range of
 
thinking, expertise, and experience as well as gender, and ethnic, regional, and
 
institutional representation.
 The conference will also be open to appropriate
 
observers, who will have opportunities each day to comment and raise questions.
 
PHASE II will include one or more one-week training institutes designed for
 
folk arts coordinators and others working in the public sector on behalf of the
 
folk  arts.
 At  present,  we  anticipate  planning  two  sessions,  inviting
 
approximately twenty participants to work with a highly skilled faculty in each
 
session.  These intensive sessions will focus on timely and specialized subject
 
areas.  Possible topics could include the performing arts of Southeast Asia, or
 
the traditional arts of new immigrants from the former Soviet Union, or seminars
 
in new approaches and analytical techniques useful to active folklore work.  The
 
actual plans for these institutes will, however, be an outgrowth of the direction
 
set in the 1994 planning meeting.
 
DISTRIBUTION We expect this planning conference to produce up to three papers
 
as well as transcripts  (from tape recordings) of meeting discussions,  and a
 
planning document for subsequent training institutes for folk arts coordinators.
 
We will circulate these materials, appropriately edited, as widely as possible.
 
Possibilities  include  publication  in  the  Journal  of  American  Folklore,
 
presentation in a panel or forum at the annual meeting of the American Folklore
 
Society,  or  circulation of portions  in newsletters that  reach public-sector
 
folklorists and folk arts coordinators.  Ideas and information resulting from the
 
subsequent training institutes will be shared informally with other folk-arts
 
workers and will become embodied in future projects.
 
VALUE  Folk arts have become more vulnerable than usual at a time when economic
 
pressures require financial cutbacks that affect them, when standard presentation
 
strategies are losing their freshness and effectiveness, and when a recent and
 
continuing influx of diverse ethnic groups introduces traditions that academic
 
folklore programs have not taught.  As a result of these changes, however, folk
 
arts have the potential to play an important role in helping the American public
 
to adjust to a multi-cultural society.  Short well-focused institutes will offer
 
folk arts specialists a way to share knowledge and information with each other,
 
rethink their activities together, and get information from other specialists
 
that they need in their work.  The initial planning session would gather highly
 
knowledgeable and experienced public-sector and academic folklorists together
 
with others whose expertise would be of use to them in reassessing the field.
 
Their thinking will benefit specialists in the field, and ultimately the folk
 
arts and artists themselves, if they can come up with new directions, strategies,
 
and plans for institutes that can reach the whole field.

May 3,  1994
 
Bess Lomax Hawes
 
I resigned as Director of the Folk and Traditional Arts
 
Program at the National Endowment  for the Arts  just over two
 
years ago.  Since
 hen  I have visited folk arts projects  in
 
some thirteen states  (AL,  NY,  SC,  KY,  CA,  GA,  WI,  CO,  MI,  HI,
 
OH TX,  VI,  DC)  as well as  spending three weeks at an Inter-
Pacific festival where  I conferred with artists and arts
 
administrators  from the Northern Marianas,  American Samoa,
 
Guam,  Hawaii
 nations.  And I
 
can say on the basis of first-hand observation that the folk
 
artists  in all these places are doing well.  They are becoming
 
ever more clear,  more confident,  more accustomed to
 
widespread public attention and to the odd things people
 
still  say about them.
 
For as we all know but rarely say out  loud in public,
 
the  real problem with the  folk and traditional arts is what
 
has been called in another context,  the triviality barrier.
 
No matter how delicate the color palettes,  how refined the
 
weaving techniques,  how imaginative the designs of a Paiute
 
coiled tray maker  (notice  I don't call her a basket weaver),
 
her work still carries with it the stigma of being an
 
artistic pursuit really only appropriate for small children.
 
Indeed "Basket Making 101"  is a synonym for a snap college
 
course for boneheads.  And "everybody" knows
 that nobody paid
 
any real attention to country fiddle music until a real
 
professional,  Aaron Copland,  came along and wrote that
 
wonderful  "Rodeo" ballet music based on some old fiddle tunes
 
he  found in the the Folk Song Archive at the Library of
 
Congress.
 
The triviality barrier is higher and,  I do believe,  even
 
more impervious to attack than the Berlin wall;  at least  I
' ve
 
been scratching away at  it my whole lifetime and I don't  see
 
a lot of marks on it.  But  recently,  due in some part,  I
 
believe,  to the work of the Folk and Traditional Arts
 
Program,  some young people are beginning to select a career
 
in the traditional arts over the other options they could
 
pursue.  This  is a really new development and excit
P

 for
 
example,  a young Native American college graduate 
es to
 
1
 
explore the Woodland flute tradition rather than/ more
 
conventional music training1 e
— his—Qw --eerrpu
t--on
-s.  Maybe
 
such decisions  represent not  just a scratch but even a small
 
crack in that wall that has  loomed so high for so long.
 
For there are riches to be  found on both sides of the
 
barrier.  I' ve always  liked "Rodeo" and I also delighted in
 
the o
or
ri
ig
gi
in
na
al
l
 
 
r
i  old Virginia fiddler that
 
Copland drew from in his remarkable score;  in fact,  on the
 
day that he came to listen,  I helped Mr.  Copland find the
 
tunes he eventually used.  And so to me  "Rodeo" can be thought
 
of as  just another version of "Hop Light,  Ladies" or,  if you
 
prefer,  you could put  it the other way around.  It would be so
 
marvellous if more art  lovers could recognize that the sharp,
 
distinctive stylistic excitement,  just  reeking of Appalachia
 
and no place else in the world and embodied in that  fiddle
 
tune,  could only have been invented and perfected by a person
 
steeped in that particular musical tradition,  not  in the
 
larger,  more diffuse,  and grander purview enjoyed by
 
Mr . Copland.
 
When I w
 working for the Endowment,  I used to think
 
that the Folk A ts Program was a
\iniature edition of the
 
Endowment as a wh \le.  We had almost \exactly the same problems
 
as our larger pare
\
ial agency.  We we 
multi-disciplinary;  we
 
were multi-cultural;
 funded individu \l artists and 501 03
 
arts groups;  we worked tbrough state,  loc \l,  and regional
 
arts agencies;  we funded presenters,  museums,  schools,  media
 
centers,  universities,  church groups,  tribes,  social agencies
 
and libraries.  We helped set
up state,  regional,  local and
 
private folk arts programs.  We did a'\few new things too;  we
 
experimented with apprenticeship prog ams and recognition
 
awards  for senior 4rtists.  The only th ng I can think of that
 
we did not try was
 o handle treasury f nds,  because we
 
rarely dealt with irstitutions that had e ough money to
 
qualify.  But anything we could possibly make work,  we tried,
 
and after a while  I began to think of the Endowment as  just a
 
larger form of the Folk Arts Program.
 
For example,  while the Endowment was worrying about how
 
to  supp rt  individual artistic creativity,  we in Folk Ar ts 
were thi
ing about how to support cultural artistic
 
creativit
 the creative capacity inherent  in all artistic
 
systems.  It s not an easy problem,  especially when you are
 
dealing with\aesthetics as diverse as those developed by
 
Louisiana Ca uns,  western cowpunchers,\Japanese ban dancers,
 
and black Mis issippi  farmers.  For although many people think
 
of the traditi
nal arts  supported by Folk Arts as  relics  from
 
the remote past\ -
-
 and many of them are,  j st  like
 
Palestrina,  just  like Gregorian chant -
-
 we  find that new
 
forms and new rep rtoires  continually bubble
 p,  fueled by
 
these ancient and  ç
aried ways of making beauty. \ And as  in the
 
larger arts world,  there are some in the folk ar s world who
 
feel that one must at all costs preserve and support the old
 
classics and others w'io feel the real action  lies with the
 
newly developing styles and repertoires.
 
My brother,  Alan Lomax,  has been engaged for the past
 
twenty-odd years  in research concerning the artistic systems
 
of the entire planet.  His  results suggest that all the
 
aesthetic styles developed by the myriad tribes and peoples
 
of the world have an extraordinary lasting power,  that they
 
keep on staying alive.  True,  they may be weakened or
 
distorted but they don't quite disappear,  no matter how
 
overshadowed by the  latest novelty -
-
 not until the  last
 
person reared in that tradition finally dies.
 
This suggests that 'these artistic styles and repertoires
 
are essential to the sheer existence of the communities where
 
they flourish;  certainly it  is plain they are essential to
 
community morale.  Other research carried out  in recent years
 
in  Italy and elsewhere has  clearly demonstrated that those
 
communities that have an actively accessible,  culturally
 
widely understood and widely practiced artistic tradition can
 
more strongly withstand catastrophes p
more quickly recover
 
from disaster,  caft pull themselves together better to face
 
the  future.
 
1• 1

And this  is
 
really why I feel  I should make  in closing a
 
special a peal  for the Folk and Traditional Arts Program even
 
though I a  quite aware that there i  no art discipline that
 
receives the 
1
1
 monetary support  it  coul'  use.  But the critical
 
area of comm nity solidarity is where\I believe the Folk Arts
 
Program has 
 made special contributions and could make
 
many more. j
ever
 its chronic under-funding continues to
 
force it to expend its monies on the tried and true.  It  is
 
drowning in its own successes,  receiving so many applications
 
from new areas  for funding already proven activities that
 
there  is nothing ±e'ft  for the experimental or for research.
 
And that  is always bad.
 
For many years,  the energy and imagination of the Folk
 
and Traditional Arts Program has helPed\the Endowment put its
 
best  foot  forward before the Congress and  the nation.  It is a
 
sad irony that the Program consistently
 ceives,  in my view,
 
m
ii
4
 share of funding an
 so t
huc
'h more than
 
share of publicity.  It  is constantly b ing called on
 
during tough political crises because of it' remarkably wide-
ranging geographic an
 cultural  impact.  It
 sad that  it  is
 
5
 
still such a tiny program and that  its  funding is  so low,
 
only 2.4% of the entire Endowment budget.
 
And look what  it does with with it!  Last year,  it  funded
 
projects  in 49 of the  56 states and territories;  during the
 
previous three years,  in all the  states and territories  save
 
two.  In FY  93  it  spread apprenticeship programs throughout
 
small communities  in 40 states,  and over half its project
 
grants went to rural areas.  This  is only a hint of Folk Arts'
 
genuinely distinguished record,  one the whole Endowment -
-
and this  Sub-Committee -
-
 can look upon with pride.  Thank
 
you.

course for boneheads. And "everybody" knows  that nobody paid
 
any real attention to country fiddle music until a real
 
professional, Aaron Copland,  came along and wrote that
 
wonderful "Rodeo" ballet music based on some old fiddle tunes
 
he found in the the Folk Song Archive at the Library of
 
Congress.
 
-2-
The triviality barrier is higher and,  I do believe,  even
 
more impervious to attack than the Berlin wall; at least I
've
 
been scratching away at it my whole lifetime and I don't see
 
a lot of marks on it. But recently,  due in some part,  I
 
believe,  to the work of the Folk and Traditional Arts
 
Program,  some young people are beginning to select a career
 
in the traditional arts over the other options they could
 
pursue. This is a really new development and exciting -
-
 for
 
example,  a young Native American college graduate decides to
 
explore the Woodland flute tradition rather than more
 
conventional music training for his own compositions. Maybe
 
such decisions represent not just a scratch but even a small
 
crack in that wall that has loomed so high for so long.
 
For there are riches to be found on both sides of the
 
barrier.  I
've always liked "Rodeo" and I also delighted in
 
the original recordings by an old Virginia fiddler that
 
Copland drew from in his remarkable score;  in fact, on the
 
day that he came to listen,  I helped Mr. Copland find the
 
tunes he eventually used. And so to me "Rodeo" can be thought
 
of as just another version of "Hop Light, Ladies" or,  if you
 
prefer,  you could put it the other way around.  It would be so
 
marvellous if more art lovers could recognize that the sharp,
 
distinctive stylistic excitement,  just reeking of Appalachia
 
and no place else in the world and embodied in that fiddle
 
tune,  could only have been invented and perfected by a person
 
steeped in that particular musical tradition, not in the
 
larger, more diffuse,  and grander purview enjoyed by
 
Mr.Copland.
 
When I was working for the Endowment,  I used to think
 
that the Folk Arts Program was a miniature edition of the
 
Endowment as a whole. We had almost exactly the same problems
 
as our larger parental agency. We were multi-disciplinary; we
 
were multi-cultural; we funded individual artists and 501 C3
 
arts groups; we worked through state,  local,  and regional
 
-3-
arts agencies; we funded presenters, museums,  schools,  media
 
centers, universities,  church groups,  tribes,  social agencies
 
and libraries. We helped set up state,  regional,  local and
 
private folk arts programs. We did a few new things too; we
 
experimented with apprenticeship programs and recognition
 
awards for senior artists. The only thing I can think of that
 
we did =
 try was to handle treasury funds, because we
 
rarely dealt with institutions that had enough money to
 
qualify. But anything we could possibly make work, we tried,
 
and after a while I began to think of the Endowment as just a
 
larger form of the Folk Arts Program.
 
For example, while the Endowment was worrying about how
 
to support individual artistic creativity, we in Folk Arts
 
were thinking about how to support cultural artistic
 
creativity,  the creative capacity inherent in all artistic
 
systems.  It's not an easy problem,  especially when you are
 
dealing with aesthetics as diverse as those developed by
 
Louisiana Cajuns,  western cowpunchers,  Japanese b=  dancers,
 
and black Mississippi farmers. For although many people think
 
of the traditional arts supported by Folk Arts as relics from
 
the remote past -
-
 and many of them are,  just like
 
Palestrina,  just like Gregorian chant -
-
 we find that new
 
forms and new repertoires continually bubble up,  fueled by
 
these ancient and varied ways of making beauty. And as in the
 
larger arts world, there are some in the folk arts world who
 
feel that one must at all costs preserve and support the old
 
classics and others who feel the real action lies with the
 
newly developing styles and repertoires.
 
My brother, Alan Lomax,  has been engaged for the past
 
twenty-odd years in research concerning the artistic systems
 
of the entire planet. His results suggest that  Jj the
 
aesthetic styles developed by the myriad tribes and peoples
 
of the world have an extraordinary lasting power,  that they
 
keep on staying alive. True,  they may be weakened or
 
-4-
distorted but they don't quite disappear,  no matter how
 
overshadowed by the latest novelty -
-
 not until the last
 
person reared in that tradition finally dies.
 
This suggests that these artistic styles and repertoires
 
are essential to the sheer existence of the communities where
 
they flourish;  certainly it is plain they are essential to
 
community morale. Other research carried out in recent years
 
in Italy and elsewhere has clearly demonstrated that those
 
communities that have an actively accessible,  culturally
 
widely understood and widely practiced artistic tradition can
 
more strongly withstand catastrophe,  can more quickly recover
 
from disaster,  can pull themselves together better to face
 
the future.
 
And this is really why I feel I should make in closing a
 
special appeal for the Folk and Traditional Arts Program even
 
though I am quite aware that there is no art discipline that
 
receives the monetary support it could use. But the critical
 
area of community solidarity is where I believe the Folk Arts
 
Program has already made special contributions and could make
 
many more. However,  its chronic under-funding continues to
 
force it to expend its monies on the tried and true.  It is
 
drowning in its own successes,  receiving so many applications
 
from new areas for funding already proven activities that
 
there is nothing left for the experimental or for research.
 
And that is always bad.
 
For many years, the energy and imagination of the Folk
 
and Traditional Arts Program has helped the Endowment put its
 
best foot forward before the Congress and the nation.  It is a
 
sad irony that the Program consistently receives,  in my view,
 
so much less than its share of funding and so much more than
 
its share of publicity.  It is constantly being called on
 
during tough political crises because of its remarkably wide-
ranging geographic and cultural impact.  It is sad that it is
 
-
5-
still such a tiny program and that its funding is so low,
 
only 2.4% of the entire Endowment budget.
 
And look what it does with with it! Last year,  it funded
 
projects in 49 of the 56 states and territories; during the
 
previous three years,  in all the states and territories save
 
two.  In FY 93 it spread apprenticeship programs throughout
 
small communities in 40 states,  and over half its project
 
grants went to rural areas.  This is only a hint of Folk Arts'
 
genuinely distinguished record,  one the whole Endowment -
-
and this Sub-Committee -
-
 can look upon with pride. Thank
 
you.

REAUTHORIZATION OF THE NATIONAL ENDOWMENT FOR THE ARTS

The National Council for the Traditional Arts,  speaking for
 
itself  and the entire  folk arts  field,  strongly recommends  the
 
reauthorization of the National Endowm ent for the Arts.
 
Without a doubt, the Endowment has vitalized the artistic and
 
cultural life of the country -
-
 by supporting artists and arts
 
institutions,  and  by making  their work  accessible  to  citizens
 
throughout the country.
 
We consider folk arts the quintessential "American" program at
 
the  Endowment  and  the  NEA  has  made  an  enormous  difference  in
 
helping  to  sustain  these  precious  and  often  fragile  cultural
 
treasures
 
The NEA's  Folk Arts  Program,  perhaps  more  than  any  other
 
Endowment  initiative,  embodies  the  rich  diversity  of  American
 
culture that unites us as a people.  It supports those forms of
 
artistic expression that spring from our deepest values and that
 
give our society both strength and vitality.  The program seeks to
 
affirm the ties between artists and their communities and to give
 
all Americans access to the magnificently varied forms of artistic
 
traditions found throughout the United States.
 
From blues and gospel music to Irish-American step-dancing,
 
from Cajun fiddling to Pueblo pottery, from Appalachian ballads to
 
Afro-American  storytelling,  the  traditional  arts  expand  our

capacity to understand one another, to value our diversity, and to
 
strengthen the social fabric of our nation.
 
Before the establi shment of NEA's  Folk Arts Program,  these
 
unique forms of artistic expression were rarely considered relevant
 
by state and regional arts councils, presenters, or other parts of
 
the arts community.
 Today, local folk arts advocates repeatedly
 
point to NEA  funding as the catalyst in leveraging support from
 
both public and private sources.
 
A survey of public folk cultural programs at the state and
 
local levels in 1988 estimated that $20 million was spent annually
 
on  such  activity,  compared  to  $2  million  ten  years  earlier.
 
Following the pattern of other Endowment programs, private sector
 
support  has  also  increased.
 Still,  this  growth  in  support  is
 
insufficient  to meet  the  burgeoning  needs  and  number  of  grant
 
requests.  Some of this  pressure might be eased if the folk arts
 
were not at the bottom of the NEA's funding priorities.
 
The allocation of dollars (including set-aside funds) to the
 
Folks  Arts  Program  in  F?  1993  was  only  2
.3  percent  of  the
 
Endowment's total budget.  In the reallocation of set-aside dollars
 
mandated by Congress in 1991, the Folk Arts Program received the
 
highest percentage cut (
18.3%) of any Endowment program.
 Certain
 
set-aside funds were then returned for work already begun with
 
state and regional arts councils to reach underserved communities.
 
Although this amounted to a slight increase in total dollars for
 
the program,  funding requests  from state  and regional  agencies
 
increased by 84 percent.  In Fl 1993, the Folk Arts budget was set
 
2
 
05/02/94
 09:26
 202 357 1565
 OFC OF TELECOMM
 
Z004
 
at only $4.1 million. .
.53 million in program funds and $1.1 million
 
from the set-aside account.
 
While  we  understand  it  is  not  within  the  scope  of  this
 
committee to establish the specific allocation of funds, we do wish
 
to  point  out  that  the  Folk Arts  Program,  despite  its  limited
 
budget, has played a major leadership role in meeting many of the
 
objectives  outlined  in  the  reauthorization  bill  now  under
 
consideration by Congress.
 For example,  its  funding  is almost
 
exclusively  devoted  to
 "projects  and  productions  which  have
 
substantial artistic and cultural significance and that reach, or
 
reflect the culture of,  a minority,  inner city,  rural or tribal
 
community" as called for in Section 954 of the current statute.
 
Using set-aside funds provided in the last reauthorization,
 
the Folk Arts Program supports activities that "would otherwise be
 
unavailable to our citizens for geographic or economic reasons",
 
again referring to words of the statute.
 Using these set-aside
 
dollars, for example, the program provides state arts agencies with
 
matching funds to assist apprenticeships between senior artists and
 
talented mid-level learners.
 In FY 1992, these funds reached 21
 
states from Hawaii to Rhode Island and from Alaska to Alabama. In
 
the same year, another $1 million in set-aside funds supported folk
 
arts projects in another 27 states and two special jurisdictions.
 
Grants using regular program funds were awarded in all fifty states
 
in  addition  to  the  District  of  Columbia,  Guam,  the  Northern
 
Marianas, American Samoa and Puerto Rico.
 
The current authorizing legislation also charges the Endowment

 Z 005
 
to support projects which give emphasis to American creativity and
 
cultural diversity . . .
 a charge at the heart and soul of the Folk
 
Arts  Program.
 A  brief  survey  of  recently  funded  projects
 
illustrates the richness of this diversity: a performance series of
 
native  Alaskan,  Eskimo,
 Indian  and  Ab ut  music,  dance  and
 
storytelling  at  the  Anchorage  Museum  of  History  and  Art;  the
 
presentation  of  traditional  performance  and  folk  arts  of  the
 
Sephardic  diaspora  at  the  L'Chaim  Festival  of  Jewish  Arts  on
 
Stanten Island;  support for the National Black Arts Festival in
 
Atlanta; a series of on-site concerts of traditional Hispanic music
 
for senior citizens in nursing homes and day care centers in New
 
Mexico; the Tennessee Banjo Institute which attracts musicians from
 
all over the country.  These examples are illustrations of the many
 
important projects supported by the Endowment that have brought the
 
vitality of the traditional arts to all the regions of our country.
 
In recognition of the success of NEA's efforts over the past
 
twenty-eight years,  we again urge Congress  to reauthorize this
 
unique government agency and to lend unqualified support to the
 
Endowment's mandate to support excellence in all the arts.

Statement to the House Appropriations
 
Subcommittee on the Interior and Related Agencies
 
May 12, 1993, Washington, D.C.
 
Dr. Nick Spitzer
 
I speak to you today as a folklorist who has served as a
 
director of folkljfe and folk arts programs for the State of
 
Louisiana's Arts Council,  as a form er senior folklife specialist
 
with the Smithsoni an,  and now as an independent media producer,
 
host and artistic director of Folk Masters: a 13 part nationally
 
heard radio concert series produced first at Carnegie Hall and
 
now at Wolf Trap.
 
Folk Arts,  more  than any program at  the Endowment,
 
represents support for the artistic  lifeblood of this country:
 
blues, gospel,  old-time jazz and country music;  cowboy skills and
 
poetry and Native American crafts; quilts, weaving,  and
 
needlework of women (
and men) in many cultures; Tex-Mex music and
 
Cajun fiddling; duck decoy carving;  Italian-American St- Joseph
 
altars; Irish-American step-dancing. Folk Arts is the program
 
that demonstrates that great art can be found all over this
 
country from Black Caribbean Garifuna drummers in south central
 
Los Angeles to fine pack basket-makers in rural Maine. The Folk
 
Arts Program does not try to import arts into communities, so
 
much as seeking aesthetic excellence interior to those places.
 
This is as true of grassroots-based folk arts projects in
 
Louisiana as it is of national programming on public radio and
 
te1evj jon.
 
Thus it was in the 1960s and 70s that folk arts specialists
 
encouraged Cajun and Creole musicians in French Louisiana to
 
1

acknowledge their surviving masters by recording them and helping
 
to present them at local festivals. When players such as the late
 
NEA Heritage Fellows fiddler Dewey Balfa and zydeco accordionist
 
Clifton Chenier refined their then underappreciated skills and
 
gained more local support they, among others,  led a musical and
 
cultural explosion from French Louisiana that continues to
 
reverberate artistically and economically, to this day.
 
Now at a national level--when,  with the support of an NEA
 
Folk Arts grant,  I bring artists to Folk Masters at Wolf Trap or
 
to our upcoming 4th of July National Public Radio broadcast from
 
the Washington Monument--those people are coming from places like
 
Clyde, North Carolina; Zuni, New Mexico; Harlem, New York City;
 
Middle Well, Texas; Fitzgerald, Georgia; Yakima,  Washington and
 
Southeast Washington, D.C. We even have a National Heritage
 
Fellow and Piedmont bluesnian, John Cephas, raised on Capital Hill
 
(and in Virginia). National folk arts programming such as the
 
radio series Folk Masters and tours of great fiddlers and
 
guitarists reach back to the very artists' communities--thereby
 
stimulating the folk arts traditions to continue at home.
 
I
've given you the good news so far. Indeed it is hard not
 
to be upbeat about the Folk Arts Program, because of the artists
 
and communities it reaches and represents to larger audiences.
 
But there are some basic problems for folk arts and artists in
 
our country and at the Endowment. Since they are so diverse and
 
because most of their arts are not practiced in institutional
 
settings like concert halls and art museums, folk artists have
 
little voice with the arts establishment. By and large they are
 
not part of 50].-C--3 tax exempt organizations.

Also, Folk Arts is really not a genre program like others at
 
the Endowment.  It is not dance alone  it is
 
is not literature alone;  it is not music or
 
it is all of these things:
 
puppet theater and Chin s
 
of Indian tribes and
. Anglo
 
flatfoot and tap
 
not theater alone;  it
 
design alone. Instead
 
dancing; Italian
 
opera; the oral literature of hundreds
 
Jack-tale tellers;  the music of a
 
polka band or a mariachi orchestra; T
Jkranian Easter Egg design
 
and the pattern in an African American basket from the South
 
Carolina Low Country. Even the media arts are embraced by folk
 
arts through documentary projects on radio, CDs, public
 
television,  in film and photography. Of course museums are also a
 
medium for display of folk arts. Folk Arts at the Endowment is
 
not a genre program, it is a way of reaching great traditional
 
artists of all cultures and all genres within those cultures in
 
America--and sharing that greatness through performance, display,
 
and recognition.
 
With such a wide constituency,  and broad multi-cultural
 
reach into the most fundamental forms of American artistic
 
excellence,  it is a continuing source of dismay to folk artists
 
of many cultural backgrounds, to traditional. community leaders,
 
and to folk arts specialists like me that Folk Arts remains the
 
smallest program at the Endowment. At around 4 million dollars
 
annually--including special set-aside monies--the Folk Arts
 
Program receives only 2.3% of the NEA budget. The Music Program
 
alone--a program dominated by funding largely restricted to
 
classical music and orchestras--has annual grant monies near 12
 
and a half million (
7-1%)-

This is not to deny the value of grants to Western classical
 
music and musicians, but to ask that we better support the one
 
program at the Endowm ent that addresses cultural equity in terms
 
of high-quality, authentic arts that actually arise in our multicultural
 
communities--including classical forms in all cultures. It is to
 
ask that when the NEA produces a promotional video with nearly
 
25% of its content devoted to folk arts, that the program whose
 
content is so praised get some funding equity in relation to its
 
obvious value to the Endowment vis-a-vis the American public and
 
the Congress.
 
In a time when there is so much talk of absolute freedom for
 
particular individuals who test social boundaries with their art-
-
 and hope for federal funds to do so--I wonder how we can still
 
be so relatively unsupportive of the great diversity of folk
 
artists. These are artists who signal American cultural freedoms
 
to our nation and the world by their continued willingness to
 
create the traditional arts of our tribal, ethnic, regional,  and
 
occupational groups--all in the settings of families,
 
neighborhoods,  communities and regions.
 
In this time when most applicants to the Folk Arts Program
 
are not from arts institutions as conventionally understood, when
 
30% are first-time applicants to the Endowment and when 42% of
 
Polk Arts Program dollars are spent in rural areas,  it is
 
appropriate to consider what would only be the second increase to
 
program funds in the last decade. An increase of $400,000 could
 
be used to satisfy demand for operating support of a new tier of
 
folk arts private non-profit organizations. These are groups like
 
Texas Folklife Resources and the Penn Center on St. Helena Island

South Carolina.  They are trying to play by Endowment rules, but
 
cannot get such organizational support from the fiscally-strapped
 
Folk Arts Program.  Such operational support is routine in other
 
Endowment program areas.  A separate increase of half this amount
 
($200,000)  could support the kind of field survey work and
 
presentation that identifies and brings to public notice some of
 
the fine folk
, arts traditions I have detailed. Another increase
 
of $400,000 could unfreeze the increasingly lower ratio of
 
funding for a record number of applications seeking record
 
dollars.  Taken together,  an increase of $1,000,000 to do all
 
three things would still only bring the Folk Arts Program to a
 
$5,000,000 dollar annual budget for the roots cultures of the
 
entire country. From my perspective,  and many other people in and
 
out of this field,  the time has come to support the kind of
 
excellence,  diversity,  impact and cultural freedoms represented
 
by the Folk Arts Program, and to do it in a serious way at least
 
commensurate with other Endowment programs of far more restricted
 
reach. Thank you.

May 17.
 Flew into Montgomery, met by Hank who took me to
 
dinner with Anne Kimsey and his new hire, Aimee Schmidt
 
replacing Erin Kellin  (recently resigned after the birth of
 
her daughter).  Aimee is a graduate of U Miss where she worked
 
under Tom Rankin who apparently thinks very highly of her.
 
She has done fieldwork in southwest Georgia on the Ichauway
 
(
former quail hunting plantation) project and on several
 
Mississippi sites.  My impression is that her main interests
 
are in the non -performing side of things -- occupational,
 
personal narratives,  material culture, etc. She seemed
 
direct,  pleasant, quiet and a bit laid back; she will start
 
full time in June.

Montgomery folk festivals  for now. (Cf news  stories enclosed)
 
Even so there is lots going on.  The Birmingham Festival will
 
continue;  there will be another state-wide shape note hymn
 
sing;  they have high hopes  for the upcoming religious music
 
celebration;  and Hank has been approached by the Alabama
 
Highland Games to add a folk component to their next event.
 
He has come up with some interesting ideas  including the
 
participation of a black covenanters congregation that moved
 
to Alabama from Missouri way back and still sings the psalms.
 
I
' m not  sure even Hank can get away with that at a Highland
 
Game,  but  it will be  fun to watch him try.
 
The ATCC is working hardest of all on media and
 
publications;"Alabama Folkways"  is continuing on radio and in
 
newspaper columns throughout the state.  A first Alabama
 
Folklife Newsletter is about to come out and the  first
 
Alabama Folklife Association  journal issue "Tributaries" as
 
well.  (Cf supporting materials) .
 I don't think ATCC will find
 
time hanging heavy on their hands even if the festival  is
 
cancelled;  it's probably more of a blow to their pride than
 
anything.
 
I also enclose a notification of their new FAX
 
number as well as a list of the participants at the board
 
meeting;  all were present except  for Lee and Sawyer;  the
 
governor's wife,  Mrs.  Folsom,  phoned Hank to apologize for
 
her absence and sent a substitute who stayed through the
 
whole afternoon -
 a good sign.  It's a good board and a credit
 
to Hank,  also to Joyce Cauthen who is exceptionally helpful,
 
hard-working,  cooperative and keeps what's really important
 
firmly front and center.  She is no scholar but knows a lot
 
about what  she knows  (Hank says her Alabama fiddlers booklet
 
is excellent)  and she  is an fine community organizer;  she
 
might well be considered as a panelist  some time.
 
May 19.
 Spent day with Hank,  mostly driving to Tuscaloosa
 
and visiting Nora Ezell,  she in great  form,  full of beans and
 
bursting with energy.  The only cloud on her horizon was the
 
cancellation of the festival,  for which she and her class of
 
quilting trainees had been preparing a special quilt top,
 
each student making a square of the same design but with her
 
own choice of material and colors;  it was to have been
 
donated to the  festival -
-
 now what can she do with it? And
 
she objected strongly to the note about her own work in Maude
 
Wohlman's catalogue that goes along with that  southern quilts
 
exhibit.  She was offended at the mention of hoodoo,  and the
 
assumption that  she was using African aesthetic values;  "I
 
don't know nothing about no Africa" she kept  saying tensely.
 
Her son is  living with her now;  she quilts  9-10 hours daily,
 
and I would recommend her without reservation as a general
 
festival participant;  she  is boiling with energy and highly
 
articulate.
 
May 20.
 At ACTC,  met with L.  Wade Black of Bozart
 
Mountain/Jade Films  (
704 Kingman Road;  Birmingham,  AL)  who is
 
working on a project to prepare a series on the history of
 
U.S.  protest  song starting back in the  colonial period.  He
 
mentioned the Sloss Furnace situation;  apparently they have
 
set themselves up as a kind of industrial park a la
 
Lowell,  Mass;  it's quite successful,  he says,  though they are
 
concerned about their failure to include and involve the
 
various European ethnic populations of Birmingham,  most
 
particularly the  Italian,  in the way they have the African-
and Anglo-Americans.  I suggested they might  come to Folk Arts
 
for a quick and dirty site visit by someone  like Anna C just
 
to get things  started,  or for a longer term field project,  or
 
for both.  Perhaps there is  still  some of that  special state
 
money lying around.  He will pass the word along.
 
Flew into Columbus;  met by Howard and Judy Sacks
 
and their daughter.
 
May 21-2.
 Spent both days on the Kenyon campus;  it couldn't
 
have been prettier,  the weather lovely,  almost everything
 
outdoors under the green trees,  lots of relaxed but content-
laden ceremony.  I went to it all,  met  lots of nice people
 
including fellow honoree Michael Harper,  a black poet from
 
Brown.  He had just edited a posthumous  collection of Sterling
 
Bron's poetry;  I volunteered that Alan would swap LWTBB for
 
his book and he accepted with pleasure.  My cap fell off
 
repeatedly in spite of all my efforts;  otherwise,  I think I
 
was a reasonably successful representative of the world of
 
folk arts,  and I enjoyed every minute of it.
 
May 23.
 Spent the previous night at Howard and Judy's -
 a
 
gorgeous old house out  in the corn country surrounded by open
 
fields about  15 minutes outside Gambier  (which is  just a part
 
of Kenyon College and vice versa,  nothing else anywhere
 
around) .During the day we drove to visit Eva Hosack,  a fine
 
rag rug maker  (braided and loom-woven) .
 She has had a number
 
of apprentices,  and has at  least  four really old-timey looms
 
in her basement where  she does her teaching,  along with an
 
entire wall of discarded wool coats on hangers  (her rug
 
stock)  and bales of woollen mill  scraps and ends.  I was
 
really impressed and wished I had gone out to visit the
 
Maryland rug makers before hand.
 
After lunch,  we took in two Amish farms -
 one was
 
run by two elderly sisters,  barefoot and white capped,  who
 
took us to see their kittens,  their hens  (who have  "whiskers"
 
and lay pale lavender eggs -
 delicious -
 Judy made a
 
marvellous omelet  for supper)  and their garden,  as well as
 
the exquisitely stitched quilts they take orders  for.  This
 
appears to be their comfortable way of handling the tawdry
 
and possibly evil business of buying and selling.  One of the
 
ladies does the piecing and one does the quilting,  and they
 
have quite a number of orders and Judy and Howard for
 
friends,  so all  is well there.  We also stopped by a younger
 
and a bit more  struggling Amish family -
 the lady does rough
 
doorway rugs and the husband rough carpentry -
 chests and the
 
like -
 plus,  of course,  running their farm and raising three
 
children.  They are worrying over the need for cash income and
 
don't quite know how to work it  out;  barter is their
 
preferred method and they asked Howard to come back the next
 
day and take the husband to visit a chiropractor.  Howard
 
agreed and told me later they would probably give him a pie.
 
Howard has received a three year Humanities grant
 
to work on the  family farm in his area;  he is planning to use
 
his graduate students and do a really well-planned,  fully
 
carried through study.  I was  impressed by how warmly he was
 
received both in academic and the surrounding communities.
 
His  situation contrasted sharply with what  I was able to find
 
out about matters  in the rest of the state,  which seems
 
unable to get together in any meaningful way.  Howard had
 
heard that Tim Lloyd has applied for the field work position
 
preparatory to the moving of the National Festival back to
 
Ohio.  He hopes he gets  it and I guess  I do too.  Certainly the
 
sort of work that Howard and Judy are doing is the kind of
 
consistent,  day-to-day,  caring kind that we would hope to see
 
right across the country.
 
Overall,  I found the  situation in Ohio,  as nice as
 
it was where  I was,  impressively contrastive to that  in
 
Alabama,  where Hank,  Joyce Cauthen,  Joey and others appear to
 
have molded together an informal but highly effective network
 
of cooperating folk-lorists and fellow travellers.  The Sacks
 
appear to be pretty isolated and they surely deserve all the
 
help that  can be gotten to them.

We at Kenyon look forward with great pleasure to your coming for
 
Commencement, May 21 and 22,  to receive an honorary degree.
 In
 
preparation for that occasion,  I would like to invite you to
 
several events surrounding the graduation ceremony, when your
 
degree will be conferred,  and request some information from you.
 
It is customary for each honorary at Kenyon Commencements to have
 
a College host who will welcome you to campus,  escort you and
 
your party to the events of the weekend and present you for your
 
honorary degree.
 Your host for Commencement will be Howard
 
Sacks,  Professor of Sociology.
 
The weekend begins with the Baccalaureate Service at 1:30 PM on
 
Saturday,  with Professor of History William Scott as the
 
principal speaker.
 We hope that you may be able to arrive in
 
time to attend that ceremony and the reception for seniors and
 
their families that will follow.
 On Saturday evening,  at 6:00
 
PM,  there will be a cocktail reception and dinner in honor of all
 
of the honorary degree recipients at Cromwell Cottage,  the
 
President's house,  and in Peirce Lounge nearby.
 
Commencement takes place on Sunday, May 22 at 10:30 AM.
 
Honoraries will gather for a short rehearsal at 9:30 that
 
morning,  then join the procession at 10:00.
 Following the
 
ceremony there will be an informal lunch for you with your party
 
and Kenyon hosts.
 
We hope that you will bring family members with you and be able
 
to arrive on Saturday morning or early afternoon.
 On the
 
enclosed reply form will you please list the persons who will
 
come to Kenyon with you,  the accommodations at the Kenyon Inn
 
that you and your party will need and the meals that you will
 
attend.
 Please describe your travel plans in detail so that we
 
may know when you will arrive and depart and provide
 
transportation from and to the Columbus airport.
 Also,  please
 
indicate whether you will need academic regalia or will bring
 
Page 2
 
your own.
 Finally, will you please send or have sent a current
 
resume or biographical sketch and two photographs of yourself,
 
glossy,  if possible.
 
Thank you,
 
Sincerely,
 
Joyce Klein
 
Coordinator for Special Events
