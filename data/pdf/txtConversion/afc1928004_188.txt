MISS JENNIE ENGEL 
WAS born in the city of New York, of German and English 
parentage. 
Made her first appearance at Laura Keene's Thea-
tre, in the extravaganza of the " Seven Sisters." 
She next 
appeared at the American Theatre, 444 Broadway, where sho 
achieved a marked success as a 
Sentimental Vocalist. 
Her 
next engagement was with Professor John McEvoy's original 
Panorama of Ireland, with whom she travelled for an entire 
season, Sh4lit,g with exquisite taste, the simple yet touching 
melodies of Tom Moore; her sympathetic soprano voice being 
peculiarly adapted to them. 
After leaving the panoramic busi-
ness she was secured for three years by the enterprising- variety 
manager, Mr. George Lea, and sang in Washington, Baltimore, 
and Detroit, w 
ith increasing success. 
Thence to Tony Pastor's 
Opera House, where she became an established favorite, singing 
originally a great many melodies that have since become so 
popular—" Nora O'Neil," " The Dear Little Shamrock," and a 
great many others. 
Miss Engel next played in New Orleans for 
three consecutive seasons as vocalist and leading Burlesque 
artist, being pronounced by the press and public as the greatest 
favorite in her line that ever played in the Crescent City. 
For 
an entire season she remained at the Howard .
Athergeum, Bos-
ton, where her popularity exceeded any other city she had 
visited. 
In fact, all through the Eastern Country Miss Engel's 
name is a 
sure card, and her receptions the most flattering and 
enthusiastic. 
For the past two seasons she will be remembered 
as one of the leading liAts of the Pastor Combination. 
All of 
Miss Engel's songs are wr:tten especially for her, and sang by 
her originally, but afterwards obtained by the rest of female 
vocalists and retailed as original productions by them through-
out the country. 
Her unique and jaunty style of costume, her 
entire stage action and 
manner, have 
been 
adopted and 
approved of by all the serio-comic vocalists in America.

OPINIONS OF THE PRESS. 
AEADEILY Or Mr.rslc-11r.NErri' 
M IS3 JENNIE ENGEL.—It 
is only 
feces ary to all:1311tiC2 tho bene!it of JENNIE ENGLa, to make it the grand 
event of the season; noC so much bacausi of her personal graces, which 
are many— of the kindly feelings which she has always hal from the play-
going pablie —but because in elegance and finish, grace and individual worth, 
Jennie Engel is an actress whom we all honor and admire. When she was , 
comparatively unknown to us, her benefit was quite an ovation, and now 
that years of intimate acquaintance have made strong the admiration she 
first inspired, there is no room to doubt that the demonstration this even-
ing will be one marked and notica.ble in her professional life. 
But with 
that modesty which has always been her chief attraction, she offers to 
the public a 
substantial equivalent for any acknowledgment they may 
make her.—..lrew Orleans Picayune. 
JENNIE Excrrm, a 
vocalist of considerable reputation, sang some popu-
lar ballads 
She was rapurously applauded, and called out four times. 
She is probably the greatest favorite in her line that has ever appeared in 
this city. 
Her songs are new - just the style to pelase; and, we are pleased 
to say, do not depend upon double entendres for strews =. 
She has a 
pleas-
ing appearance and sings with great taste.—Xcut York Clipper. 
M ISS JENNIE ENGEL presides over the troupe as its Queen of Song, 
and warbles in the sweetest strains.—New Orleans Times. 
M ISS JENNIE ENGEL, on her first appearance in Hamilton, won for 
herself golden opinions. 
Her voice is very soft, sweet, and pathetic. and 
beautifully adapted for the singing of those touching melodies of Tom 
Moore, which are so appropriately introduced throughout the exhibition. 
—Canadian Paper. 
II TSS ENGEL, who possesses a very sweet voice, rendered several of 
Moore's melodies in very pleasing style, and received many plaudits.— 7b-
rode ar'op.T. 
THE patrons of lids theatre are completely enraptured with 2tIrsi. 
JENNIE ENGEL, the beautiful eantatrice. 
Miss Esa 
ill. is possessed of a 
countenance., figure, mien and voice, seldom, if ever, witnessed in this city. 
Her voice is mellow as the flute, and of a 
richness calculated to enrapture 
the most stubborn stoic. --Baltimore Star.

Street, Boston, Mass. 
Price 3.5 coma. 
Sung with immense applause by it trx. DAVIS. 
A TINY, pretty boy was Been 
To climb his father's knee, 
And kiss his brawny cheek and say, 
"Now papa, you kiss me." 
The father pressed his darling child, 
And smoothed his silken hair, 
And Willi murmured with a 
sigh, 
" 
I 
wish mamma was here!" 
CHORUS. 
I 
wish mamma was here ! 
I 
wish mamma was here!" 
And Willie murmured with a 
sigh, 
" 
I 
wish mamma was here!" 
A tear rolled down the father's cheek, 
He pressed his pining boy, 
For her be loved had gone before, 
And Willie's end was nigh; 
He bore him to his little cot, 
And dried the falling tear, 
And Willie murmured in his sleep, 
" 
I 
wish mamma was here !" 
" 
I 
wish mamma," etc. 
His darling pined that very night, 
Until the turn of tide, 
The angel death was near him then, 
At early dawn he died. 
The father cried in wild despair, 
"Oh! live, my darling dear :" 
And Willie breathed his last ftn1 sigh, 
" 
I 
know mamma is here i" 
" 
I 
wish mamma," etc. 
r_ -Mitten by GEO. W A.11E. 
Sung by JENNIE ENGEL. 
THERE was a 
young woman her name. was Fan, 
That's the way the story goes; 
She fell in love with a 
man named Dan, 
That's the way the story goes. 
Now Dan loved Fan and Fan loved Dan, 
As true as a 
woman l
oves a man ; 
And Dan he owned a 
chestnut stand, 
That's the way the story goes. 
I'd like to get married, says Dan to Fan, 
That's the way the srory goes ; 
Says Fan, I 
quite approve of the p7an, 
That's the way the story goes ; 
Dan said, go get your parents' consent ; 
Fan said she would, and away she went, 
Looking so fair and innocent, 
That's the way the story goes.. 
In a 
grocery store in Christie street, 
That's the ‘vay the story goes ; 
Another yOung man she chanced to meet, 
That's the way the story goes; 
lie looLei so shy and winked bis eve, 
To escape his glances na, (lid try ; 
'Twas all in vain, he gave her a 
pie, 
That's the way the story goes. 
(1) 
THAT'S THE WAY THE STORY GOES. 
Concluded. 
The pie it gained the heart of Fan, 
That's the way the story goes; 
The rival of Dan was a 
grocery man, 
That's the way the story goes ; 
Fan gained her father's and mother's consent 
To get married, and off with the Dutchman went; 
But since that day she's had cause to repent, 
That's the way the story goes. 
For coming away from church that day, 
That's the way the story goes; 
A 
German band began to play, 
That's the way the story gees; 
And frightened a 
horse in a 
prison van, 
Knocked down and killed the poor Dutchman, 
And made a 
widow of faithless Fan, 
That's the way the story goes. 
Now broken hearted about the streets, 
That's the way the story goes; 
Faithless Fan her Dan oft meets. 
That's the way the story goes; 
He heeds her not but passes her by, 
" 
All hot, chestnuts," she hears him cry, 
She's sorry she ever took the pie, 
That's the way the story goes,.

THE LITTLE COLLEEN—[CONCLUDED.1 
My father had gone to his work on the farm, 
My mother was minding the dairy, 
TO go to the fair I 
thought it no harm, 
So tripped it as light as a 
fairy; 
The lads and the lasses were dancing with glee, 
Miss Macarty was out with big Harry; 
I 
looked all around, but no where could I 
see 
My swateheart, my own darling Larry. 
Cho.—Then success, &c. 
Then the piper struck up wid a 
beautiful tune, 
Och, the music he play'd was delightful; 
If Larry don't come I'll go mad very soon, 
For iudade I 
was getting quite spiteful; 
They kissed in the ring, the buckle they crost, 
My feet I 
could scarcely keep quiet, 
I 
wanted a 
jig, but my partner I'd lost, 
When I 
get him I'll kick up a 
riot. 
Cko.—Then success, &c. 
Mister Larry in the midst of the fair I 
did spy, 
He was dancing a 
lilt so delicious 
With Mistress Kate Kearney; to myself then thinks I, 
This conduct is rather suspicious; 
To trate me so lighily, you'll say 'twas a 
shame, 
When admirers I 
know I 
have plenty, 
To put up with such conduct I'd be much to blame, 
Where he's one swateheart, I 
can get twinty. 
Cho.—Then success, &c. 
If a 
nate Irish boy in the company here 
Will propose then, no longer I'll tarry; 
If he's English I 
don't mind, bekase I've a 
fear 
I'm getting too ould now to marry; 
If he's Scotch I 
don't mind, for I 
now feel inclined 
For his conduct to make Larry w 
histle ; 
If we wed, our affections they shall be entwined 
Like the Shamrock, the Rose, and the Thistle. 
Cho.—Then success, &e.

PRETTY CAROLINA ;

CHOW CHOW CHOPSTICK. 
AN ANGLO-CIIINO SERIO-COMICO SONG 0 
Written and composed by G. W. H UNT. 
CHIN, Chin, Chow, that's very good China— 
Means I'm going to sing a 
song, 
About a 
curious beau of mine, a 
"Chow Chow Chopstick " of Hong Kong. 
Chopstick was a 
Bohm merchant ; 
Finest tea he used to grow; 
Wishing for an English bride, ho 
Used to bore and bother me so. 
SPOKEN.—W ith his— 
eitortus. 
Chin, Chin. pretty Carolina, 
Chow Chow love yon so. 
You, the pretty girl in China, 
AhI me, don't say nu! 
His complexion rather smoky, 
Very thin, and rather tall, 
Used to smile whenever spoke he; 
Nasal organ somewhat small; 
Finger nails so long I 
think he'll 
Surely scratch himself some day, 
Iatle eyes that used to twinkle, 
Every time to me he'd say— 
Chin, chin ; pretty Carolina, etc. 
He was famed for purest Pekoe, 
Strong Gunpowder, choice Souchong, 
Finest flavor'd you could seek, 0! 
Came from Chopstick of Hong Kong, 
PRETTY CAROLINA.—Continued. 
Loved by all the Chinese ladies, 
Yournr, old, thin, stout, short and tall, 
Those he scorned, but always made his 
Rule to call me best of all. 
Chin, chin, pretty Carolina, etc. 
Said he--" You be Mrs. Chow Chow, 
Chopstick he do love you so, 
We will live on little bow wow," 
Politely I 
answer'd "110 ;" 
Then said he, with strong Gunpowder, 
I 
will kill myself—shoot. bang! 
Then he vow'd by great big Thunder, 
By his pigtail he would hang. 
Chin, chin, pretty Carolina, etc. 
Ile would not suit Carolina, 
English love would better please, 
Don't care for Chinese nor China, 
The only thing I 
likes—their Teas, 
But I 
fear he may come over 
Here and find me out some day, 
If he does this Chinese lover, 
Chow Chow Chopstick's sure to say, 
Chin, Chin, pretty Carolina,...__, 
ch -
O;,v, Chow, love you so, 
- 
Me come all the way from China, 
Now you can't say no.

ILILLARNEY.—[CoNcLuDED.1 
Innisfallen's ruined shrine 
May suggest a 
passing sigh ; 
But man's faith can tie'er decline, 
Such God's wonders floating by. 
Castle Lough and Glena Bay, 
Mountains Tore and Eagles' Nest, 
Still at Mueross you must pray, 
Though the monks are now at rest. 
Angels wonder not that man 
There would fain prolong life's span 
Beauty's home, Killarney, 
Ever fair Killarney. 
No place else can charm the eye 
With such bright and varied tints, 
Every rock that you pass by, 
Verdure broiders or besprints ; 
Virgin there the green grass grows, 
Every morn spring's natal day, 
Bright-hued berries doff the snows, 
Smiling winter's frown away. 
Angels often pausing there, 
Doubt if Eden were more fair: 
Beauty's home, Killarney 
Ever fair Killarney.

S 
Written and compwed by G. W. HiJIM 
I SING " Hurrah for our hearts of oak," 
And " Hurrah for the open sea," 
" 
Hurrah for our ga.11ant sailors " too, 
Wherever they may be. 
Hurrah for our army, shout hurrah ! 
And our valiant volunteers, 
Hurrah for the men who thrash the foe, 
Whenever he appears. 
CHORUS. 
For they are the men for me, my boys, 
They are the men for me; 
God save our land and bless the tried and true, 
For they are the men for me. 
Hurrah for the Mall with a 
dollar a 
day, 
And hurrah for the man with two, 
Hurrah for the man with a 
thousand a 
year, 
And who's got no work to do. 
Hurrah for the man with five hundred thousand sknds, 
Whoever he may be, 
And hurrah for that man, if he makes his will, 
And leaves it all to me. 
Then be is the man for me, my boys, 
The is the man for me, 
If he left me ev'ry dollar, I'd ne'er be out of collar, 
So he'd be the man for me. 
II arrah for the coon who never fee's queer 
When he goes upon the sea, 
hurrah for the party \vial a 
heap of poor relations, 
But who never a 
one does see ; 
Hurrah for the henpeck d 
husband, who 
Don't wish he'd single tarried, 
And hurrah, hurrah, for Cho jolly old maid, 
Who doeso't wish she'd been married. 
CHORUS. 
For she's the old maid for me, my boys, 
That's the old maid for me, 
Who don't want man to cheer her, or to come a 
little nearer, 
Then, that's the old maid for me.. 
Hurrah for the man who never kick' d 
A " poor unlucky wight " when he is down ; 
Hurrah for the man with a 
cheerful heart, 
Who hasn't got " a 
cheerful 
brown,' " 
Hurrah for the man who never backs 
A 
horse but what he wins, 
And hurrah, hurrah for the " honest working man," 
Who's the father of a 
half a 
dozen twins. 
For he's the man for me, my boys, 
He's the man for me ; 
The friend of emigration and a 
surplus population, 
So he's the man for me. 
Hurrah for the wife who has always a 
smile, 
And who is not always wanting a 
now bonnet, 
Hurrah for the man with a 
jovial face, 
And a 
jolly good nose upon it; 
Hurrah, hurrah 
for the dear, dear girls, 
May their charms be never less, 
And hurrah for the man who lends a 
helping hand 
To another in distress. 
CHORUS. 
For he's the man for me, my boys, 
He is the man for me, 
And if you like this lay, then I 
am bound to say, 
That you are the men for me.

The girl with the gold - en

To dilate on this beautiful creature 
Is a 
task not easily done, 
She's a

She can bop, skip, and do the little caper

The other ballet girls can ne'er ape her,

At me in the stalls, I

JOHNNY, THE ENGINE-DRIVER.—[CONCLUDED. 
My Johnny's eyes are a 
deep dark black, 
And likewise is his hair; 
And BO'S his face and hands sometimes, 
But for that I 
do not care; 
There's not a 
driver on the line 
So bold and brave as he; 
Ohl I 
am so fond of Johnny,—and 
My Johnny's fond of me. 
C110.-011 I 
my Johnny, &e. 
When my love starts on a 
journey, 
On the platform there I 
stand, 
First he makes his engine whistle, 
Then to Inc he'll kiss his hand; 
His engine puffs, and blows, and goes, 
And I 
watch till out of sight; 
And then I 
long to see my love 
Come back again all right. 
CH0.- 011 I 
my Johnny, dre. 
There's not another man like him 
Can make the engine scream, 
And can't he make an awful noise, 
When he blows off the steam; 
Along the line at lightning speed, 
My Johnny likes to dash, 
But lor' I 
I 
often quake for fear 
He'll some day go to smash 
Cuo.—Oh I 
my Johnny, dre. 
One day he quietly asked if I'd 
His "Stoker" be for life, 
Or rather, to be plainer, would 
I 
be his darling wife! 
So I 
promised to be his "Tender" half, 
And he vowed by "smoke" and "steam," 
We ne'er should rail, but keep in line, 
And make life pats like a 
dream!

X FANCY I'VE SEEN YOU BEFORE.—[CorycLuDrp.] 
Thro' life I've been neither too proud nor too nice, 
Though, of course, that's no business of thine, 
And although the three card trick's considered a 
vice, 
'Twas a 
favorite hobby of mine. 
But last Epsom races, while plying my game 
(Which I 
never shall do any more), 
A 
fellow came up, and requested my name, 
For he fancied he'd seen me before. 
Cno.—(He said) I 
think I 
have, &e. 
I 
told him that he was a 
stranger to me, 
But next moment I 
stared with surprise, 
When the fellow quite coolly informed me that he 
Was a 
mounted police in disguise; 
Well, he took me in charge, locked me up fcr the night, 
And next morning I 
had to appear 
Before the old judge, who startled me quite, 
By mumbling these words in my ear: 
C110.— I 
fancy I've seen, (h. 
I 
politely informed the old gent he was wrong, 
For I 
never had been there before; 
When he warned me that I 
must not come out so strong, 
Or he'd certainly punish me more; 
The three card trick game was then proved against me, 
Which I 
stoutly and firmly denied, 
But I 
made no impression, I 
plainly could see, 
For the magistrate coolly replied: 
CI:op.—I've heard that old story before, 
I've beard that old story before, 
The tale seems to be so familiar to me, 
That I 
fancy I've heard it before. 
Well, he gave me three months which my feelings annoyed, 
And in prison three months I 
did stay, 
Since which I 
have sworn lawless games to avoid, 
For I 
find that they don't always pay. 
So I've turned comic singer, and nightly appear 
To amuse and obtain an encore 
Yet folks everywhere, when my voice they do hear, 
Still fancy they've seen me before. 
Clco.—I Wink I 
have, de.

So beautiful and free : 
Be not cast down, my charming bride, 
I'll soon return to thee, 
I'll soon return to thee. 
The rain falls fast, the lightning gleams, 
He can no longer bide,

O'erwhehn him in their tide. 
The mountain torrents cease to roar, 
The waters calmly glide, 
But where is he ?—alas! no more 
He comes to greet his bride, 
He greets no more his lovely bride.

That spot to thous,:nds dear, 
Where dashing belles and heavy swells, 
Assemble ey'ry year: 
Sonic like to roam along the Pier, 
And view what that ecnintands, 
But my delight, from morn till night, 
Is strolling on the sands. 
CI101:13S. 
Strolling on the sands, strolling on the sands, 
Watching- all the bathers dip, list'ning to the band ; 
Strolling on the sands, strolling on the sands, 
In cool or heat there's nought to beat a 
stroll upon the sands. 
rn ne'er forget last summer- time, 
I 
spent a 
fortnight there, 
And made the sweet acquaintance of 
A lovely lady fair, 
She'd gone to bathe at Dumpton Gap, 
But, oh ! the naughty (mean, 
For once she thought she'd do without 
That vile bathing machine. 
She placed her clothes upon the beach, 
Then in the water played, 
But when she tried to come on shore, 
0h1! wasn't she dismayed; 
The tide had turn'd, and all her clothes 
Were floating out to sea, 
She'd nothinr, but her bathing dress— 
In what a 
plight to be. 
I 
feteh'd her mother to her aid, 
And saved all further st: ife, 
The maiden said, " this g: eat event 
think of all my life." 
We soon became the best of friends 
For all erjoy'd the fun ; 
We're lovers now—and soon we two 
Are going to be one.

OH DEAR, I'M SO PLEASED.—NoNcLunED.] 
He told me one day, and it surely is quite true, 
With a 
fondness so touching I 
ne'er shall forget, 
That he loved me most dearly as older be grew, 
And the pang had remained since the first time we met, 
Then his words are so charming, oh dear, I'm so pleased, 
Ha, ha, ha, ha, I'm so pleased, ha, ha, ha, ha, I'm so pleased; 
Then his words are so charming, oh dear, I'm so pleased. 
My old grandmother frowns, and protests I'm too young, 
With the lessons of Cupid so soon to be teased, 
But so sweet is the honey that flows from his tongue, 
I 
could listen forever, oh dear, Pm so pleased. 
Ha, ha, ha, ha, I'm so pleased, ha, ha, ha, ha, I'm so pleased; 
I 
could listen for ever, oh dear, I'm so pleased. 
If he asks me to wed, as be hinted to-day, 
When my band he so kindly and tenderly squeezed, 
He's so charming a 
youth, that I'm sure I 
can't say nay, 
I'll go and be married, oh dear, I'm so pleased. 
Ha, ha, ha, ha, I'm so pleased, ha, ha, ha, ha, I'm so pleased, 
I'm going to be married, oh dear, I'm so pleased. 
WHEN VULCAN FORGED. 
WnEN Vulcan forged the bolts of Jove 
YEtna's roaring glow, 
Neptune petitioned he might prove 
Their use and power below; 
But finding in the boundless deep, 
Such thunders would but idly sleep, 
He with them armed Britannia's band, 
To guard from foes her native land. 
Long may she hold the awful right, 
And when through circling flame 
She darts her vengeance in the fight, 
May justice guide her aim, 
While, if assailed in future wars, 
Her soldiers brave and gallant tars 
Shall launch her fires from every hand 
On every foe to Briton's land.

IT'S FUNNY WHEN YOU FEEL THAT WAY. 
I 
SHAN'T forget how queer I 
felt when first I 
fell in love, -
I 
had a 
most sevne attack through squeezing a 
lady's glove. 
Her lovely band was in it as I 
danced with her so gay, 
I 
thought myself in paradise—it's funny when you feel that 
way. 
C1101117S, 
I 
felt as the' I'd tumbled into honey, and some one had left me 
all their money. 
The feeling's so peculiar and funny, it's funny when you feel 
that way. 
I 
took hor down to supper, and sat down by her side, 
I 
helped her to the ices, and filled her (*lass with pride, 
In fact paid such attention, that she viewed Inc with dismay, 
I 
moved my chair so close to hers, it's funny when you feel that 
way. 
I 
felt as the', etc. 
We met again one afternoon, and as wo were alone, 
I 
plucked up nerve to ask her if some day she'd be my own ; 
She blushed and said, go see papa and ask him if I 
may, 
I 
danced the cancan round the room, it's funny when you feel 
that way. 
I 
felt as tho', etc. 
The old man said that we might wed and so he crowned our 
bliss, 
And I 
shall be a 
married man in about a 
month from this. 
It seems as though the time, somehow, would never pass away, 
I

A

All sorts of weather, hail or rain,

I'd long and sigh with love until

asked a 
parting kiss,

I 
sunk upon my knees in quite 
An agonizing state; 
"Selina, say you'll have your George, 
And when shall we he wed I" 
I 
longed to hear my love's reply, 
And this is what she said—

Of course we feel a 
little hurt 
To learn one's sweetheart is a 
flirt ; 
You find out that you're taken in, 
But never mind, go in and win; 
Spoil the fellow's little game, 
Go and do the very same; 
Tell him, what is very true, 
What's good for him, is good for you. 
Cno.—Jog along, &e. 
Suppose our spouse gets tipsy quite, 
Although a 
row would serve him right, 
Don't pick a

If headache serves him out next day, 
But if it shouldn't serve him so, 
You've been a 
model wife, you know.

And sniv'lling won't the matter mend_

Suppose you're dressing for a

Your curling hair won't curl at all, 
Your white gloves crack, your laces break, 
Your fav'rite partners others take; 
Never mind, don't fume and fret, 
Whatever else you may forget, 
In weal or woe, in good or ill, 
Girls bravely chant this chorus still.

But if you don't applaud it, why,

i3iA iJT1FUL LOVE. 
LOVE, love, oh, what is love 1 
love, ' tis that makes man feel so 
peculiar : 
Oh,love, who does not love a 
Maud, a Matilda, a 
Jane or a 
Julia 
Love it is, and love alone, that makes the world go round tind 
round, 
Leve is certain to be known, where a 
woman's to be found. 
When one has the fi: st attack it's like raspberry jam, running 
down ones back. 
CI1011.17S. 
Oh, love, beautiful love, love it is that makes a 
man feel so peen 
liar. 
Oh, love, beautiful love, a 
man's but a 
fool when he falls in love. 
Oh, hove, when you're in love, to presents, to parties and picnic.; 
you treat her, 
Oh, love, just squeeze her glove, and you feel just as tly4' you'd 
111e to eat her; 
But the best of loves must part—then an end COO1'-'3 to y( u: 
You press the dear one to your heart and take from her the 
parting kiss. 
You bid her good-bye at the door with another sly kiss and two 
or three more. 
Oh, love, etc. 
Oh love, when you're in love every half hour you'd go to court 
her. 
But oh, love, if she won't love, you talk about drowning yourself 
in cold water; 
If it's all dela she'll .,Tig.7,1e and say, please ask father if I 
mar, 
Then you feel so jolly and gay, and tease her till she names the 
day, 
You'll serenade her when she's abed and her dad drops fiewer-
pots on your head. 
Oh love, etc. 
Oh love, when you've your love out, ail the money you have 
you must ladle, 
Servants, dresseSTparties, and bails, perhaps each year a 
cherub 
to lay in the cradle. 
When the honeymoon is teat then your eyes are not so blind, 
Your dream was far too good to last and your face grows len:: 
to find, 
Your looked-for happiuess begins with a mother-in-law 
• beautiful twins. 
Oh love, otc. 
SPEAK OUT LIKE A MAN. 
Though you gentleman are smiling, 
Its very plain to me, 
But most of you are single, 
Which of course ought not to be. 
There's girls I'm sure in plenty, 
Who would your happiness advance, 
By weddiu4 you to-
morrow 
If they only had a 
chance. 
CITODATS. 
Then don't be shy, for single life's a 
sin; 
Fair lady, as the proverb says, 
Faint heart did novel' 
Thee don't be shy, 
But do the best you can, 
And when you go a 
courting 
Why, speak out like a 
man. 
When at your kind attentions, 
We appear to take offence , 
Pray don't be disconcerted, 
That's merely a 
pretence 
If to wring your ears ‘ve threaten, 
We of course mean no such thing, 
It's merely a 
suggestion— 
We ourselves should like a 
ring. 
Then don't be shy, etc. 
Though we ladies are as sisters 
To the angels up above, 
Yet only whisper marriage. 
And we're gentle as a 
dove. 
To say " 1
7,s" is very foolish, 
When the question popp'd may be, 
But "

would be au answf r 
Much more silly you'll agree. 
Then don't be shy, 04

I'd jumped over the wall one night 
In search of sweet Rosanna, 
And though I 
gently whistled, 
My love did not appear; 
But my hair stood bolt upright, 
For out came her dad, the tanner, 
Oh I 
my teeth they rattled like dominoes, 
And my legs doubled up with fear.

To cure her of her love for me, 
Some say my love's no more. 
If she's defunct, then soon 
Shall they find my clay-cold corpus, 
And our ghosts shall come, and frighten her dad 
Behind the kitchen door.

UP TO TFTTI MARK. 
Written and sung by JENNIE Exam.. 
Am," 
Wait for the Turn of the Tide." 
'Tie well to be up to the mark, my boys; 
Just look at the days gone by, 
When Washinaton planted our flag, my boys, 
And raised our bright banner on MA ; 
When Jefferson stood by this land of the free, 
And Lafayette too, he fought in the field ; 
When first shone our stars in the face of the foe, 
Those stars and those stripes which never did yield. 
CHORUS . 
For these men were up to the mark, my boys, 
They brought sweet sunlight from the dark, 
They made this great land where we live, my boys, 
And proved themselves up to the mark! 
And they'll find before long the north pole, my boys, 
Or.travel that northern sea through; 
Or die at their post like brave Hall, my boys, 
Midst the icebergs of cold eighty-two. 
We Yankees, ' tis said, through the world, my boys, 
Do not know the meaning of defeat or fail; 
Our banner shall there be unfurrd, my boys, 
The future will soon tell of the tale. 
CHORUS . 
We've men left like Morton and Hayes, my boys, 
One failure but kindles the spark ; 
And brings to the surface them all, my boys, 
These men that are up to the mark. 
Dear Ireland, that's over the seas, my boys, 
Has got a 
bright record to show; 
Since Sarsfield he fought for the cause, my boys, 
And trod down the base Saxon foe. 
O'Connell he struggled with might, my boys, 
Brave Emmett he gave his dear life, 
Their sons will continue the fight, my boys,' 
Till the shamrock does win in the strife. 
CHORUS . 
So list to the words of this song, my boys, 
Though DOW you may seem in the dark, 
A good time will come for the Irish, pay boys, 
And 
prvve themselves up to the mark. 
/CATTY AVOURNEEN. 
?was a 
cell winter's night and the tempest was snarlite, 
The snow like a 
sheet covered cabin and. stye, 
When Barney flew over the hills to his darlize. 
And tapped at the window where Katty did lie. 
" 
Arrah, jewel," said he, are ye sleepin' or wakin' ? 
The night's bitter cold, an' my coat it is thin; 
Oh, the storm ' tis a 
brewin', the frost it is bakin; 
Oh, Katty Avourneen, you must let me in. _ 
Arrah, Barney, cried she, and she spoke thro' the window,, 
Ah, would ye be takin' me out of my bed ? 
To come at this time it's a 
shame and a 
sin, too; 
It's whiskey, not love, that's got into your head. 
If your heart it was true, of my fame you'd be tender; 
Consider the time and there's nobody in, 
Oh, what has a 
poor girl but her name to defend her; 
No, Barney Avourneen, I 
won't let you in. 
Ah, cushla, cried he, it's my heart is a 
fountain 
That weeps for the wrong I 
might lay at your door; 
Your name is more white than the snow on the mountain 
And Barney would die to preserve it as pure; 
I'll go to my home, though the winter winds face me, 
I'll whistle them off, for I'm happy within; 
An' the words of my Kathleen will comfort and bless me: 
Oh, Barney Avourneen, J 
won't let you in 
HER BRIGHT SMILE HAUNTS NE STILL. 
Ms years since last we met, and we may not meet again; 
I 
have struggled to forget, but that struggle was in vain. 
For, her voice lives on the breeze, and her spirit comes at will; 
In the midnight on tit.. 
as, her bright smile haunts me still 
At the first sweet dawn of light, when I 
gaze upon the deep, 
Her form still greets my sight, while the stars their vigil. 
keep. 
When I 
close mine aching eyes, sweet dreams my senses fill; 
And, from sleep when I 
arise, her bright smile haunts me still. 
I 
have sailed 'neath alien skies, I 
have trod the desert path; 
I 
have seen the storm arise like a 
giant in his wrath. . 
Every danger / have known, that. a 
reckless life can fill ; 
Yet her presence is not flown, her bright smile haunts me still.

BILLY JOHNSON'S BALL.—[CoricumEn] 
There were the Jones-es-es, and the Brown-es-es, 
And the Smith-es-es a 
score, 
The Spriggins-es, the Scoggins-es, 
And half a 
dozen more; 
In Billy's room, there wasn't room, 
To dance a 
decent jig, 
So he went and took a 
big one 
At " The Tinder-box and Pig." 
Spoke—An efficient band was provided, consisting of a 
fiddle 
tin whistle, and a 
Jew's harp and they played—Ono. 
They introduced the baby, 
And we kissed it twice all round, 
Mrs. Johnson was quite "overcome," 
Fell fainting to the ground. 
But they " brought her to" with water, 
And " a 
drop of something in," 
And when " she felt herself again," 
The dancing did begin.

In and out and round about., 
Such a 
ball was never seen, 
And every now and then, 
We'd " a

With all the girls he'd find, 
Mrs. Johnson she grew jealous, 
And declared he was " unkind."

'Twas somehow " ups and downs," 
To tell you how it ended,

Everything you'd please: 
Treacle, soap, and bundles of wood, 
Lollypops and cheese. 
His daughter minds the shop, 
It's a 
treat to see her serve; 
I'd like to run away with her, 
But I 
haven't got the nerve.—Csmarrs. 
Poor old Brown he's very often. 
Troubled with the gout, 
He " grumbles" in the little parlor, 
When he can't get out. 
Then I 
go and make a 
purchase, 
Oh, and when she hands the change, 
That gal makes me feel gal-vanized, 
I 
feels so very strange.—Cuoaus. 
Miss Brown she smiles so sweetly, 
When I 
says a 
tender word, 
lint old Brown says that she shall wed 
A

lord; 
but I 
don't think as ever

And some tains go in for trade, 
But I 
havn't such bores to alarm me, 
My fortune was already made.

In the Park I 
am often seen driving,-
When the dear girls take me for a 
duke I 
Whenever I 
go in for billiards, 
Somehow I'm a 
demon to fluke. 
Sometimes to an evening party, 
To keep them alive in I 
peep, 
Whenever they ask me sing 
They're certain to fall fast asleep. 
SPOKEN-4 give them " Yankee Doodle," you know, or elAe I 
give them the " Dead March in Saul" on the flute; oh, it's awfully 
jolly-they do laugh, it completely doubles them up- Cue.

Some fellows will borrow a 
tenner, 
For which I 
get no T. 0. U.; 
Sometimes I 
assist them in bills, 
Which / have to pay when they're due. 
There are mothers, with daughters to marry, 
Somehow take a 
fancy to me; 
They think they're as deep as Old Harry; 
But the bait and the hook I 
can see. 
Sros.r4t-And when they find it is no go, they say-Ono.

I MOULD LIRE TO BE A FAIRY.-10oNoLuozo.1 
If I 
had fairy wings, you know, 
I'd tease out of their lives 
Old bachelors, and flirting men, 
Who won't make girls their wives; 
I'd hover round their haunts, and show 
The joy a 
wedding brings, 
And try to touch their stony hearts 
With Cupid's fairy wings. 
CHORUS.—I 
sllould like to he %fairy, 
So graceful, light, and airy; 
How nice to be a 
fairy with 
A 
pair of paper wings. 
I'd try to show the wealthy few, 
The good they might insure, 
With fairy wings of golden hue, 
Amidst our starving poor; 
I'd teach them in sumptuous borne% 
That poverty oft brings 
The poor to lose it's honesty 
Through want of golden wings. 
Cnonus.—I should like to be a 
fairy, 
So graceful, light, and airy; 
How nice to be a 
fairy -with 
A 
pair of paper wings. 
We've all our different fancies, let 
Them be whate'er they may, 
If we wish to do the heavy, why 
Then for it we must pay; 
So, when upon the " fly," my boys, 
Your sprees and little flings, 
Just bear in mind that bank notes inaks 
The best of paper wings. 
CEOUTS.—I should like to be a 
fairy, 
So graceful, light, and airy; 
How nice to be a 
fairy -with 
A 
pair of paper wings.

Oh 1- Cho,

FANCY I CAN SEE HER NOW.---10oNcLuntvis 
I've had one fight since I've been here, 
I 
knocked a 
fellow flat; 
Because he roared right in my ear,— 
" 
I 
say, I'll have your hat ;' 
This hat my Betsy gave to me, 
And said, in voice so sweet, 
You wear this for my sake, dear Joe," 
As she placed it on my feet. 
Spoken— My head I 
mean.—I'm thinkin' so much o' her, I 
don'• 
know what 1 
say.—Cnoaus. 
The lovely bread she used to bake, 
The scones and pancakes too; 
And Everton Toffy she could make 
As sticky and thick as glue. 
I'd back her, too, agiu the world, 
Liver and bacon to fry, 
When think o' the watery qaters too, 
The steam comes from my eyT. 
Spoken—I 
mean, when I 
think o' the steaming 'taters the wate 
comes frac my eye, darned if I 
know what I'm sayin', thinkia' 
that lass.—Cuonus. 
I 
bought her, once, a 
splendid dress, 
That cost me many a 
groat; 
To show ye how she loved me, now, 
I'll tell a 
nannygoat :—(anecdote.) 
She saved a 
great lump of her dress, 
This is a 
truth, I 
vow, 
And made me this fine waistcoat, 
That ye see me wearite now. 
Spoken—Look at that!—there's a 
fit,—the Prince o' Wales" 
tailor couldn't mak' better nor that—no fear o' it splittin---plent7 
o' room to grow,--ah I 
she woe a 
good lass, she'd do onything l'C 
tell her without me kickiu' her. 
She wor dairy-maid wi' 
Fen, I 
used to work at plough,—then we used to romp when work 
wor done—I 
used to pinch her arm as hard as I 
could till sli 
cried, and she used to hi 5 I 
on the head wi' the spanc,—wha, 
It's no use me a-standin' here, 
I'm wastin' all my time; 
But to meet my Bet again, 
The hi7liest mountains I 
would climb; 
If I 
can't see nowt (
43 her here, 
Frae Lunnou I'll retire, 
And weepin' for my Betsy Gray, 
Go back tao Laneashire.—Cnoass.

As down Broadway they go, 
march close by the band, 
When my trombone sees me,

My mellow brass trombone.

Some girls love the soldiers
