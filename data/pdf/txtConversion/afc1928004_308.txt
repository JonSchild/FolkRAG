OPINIONS OF THE PRESS, 
THEATRE COMIQUE,Broadway.—The principal attraction here 
this week is the great Harry Osborne and Fanny Wentworth in 
their beautiful and soul-stirring sketch entitled, '' Mollie's Trou-
bles and Sunshine," in which they display a 
profusion of criginal 
wit, sentiment, humor and versatility, harry Osborne making 
two distinct changes, from a 
brainless English fop, to the lively 
and humorous Irish lad, impersonating each to perfection, while 
Fanny Wentworth kept the audience alive with her sparkling 
merriment, rich brogue and quick wit, then again moving them 
to tears in her sentiment, al.ogether commanding the due ap-
preciation of the public.—Evening Telegram. 
Harry Osborne and Fanny Wentworth are truly the great 
attraction at the Tivoli this week, their beautiful original 
sketch entitled, " The Soldier's Return," which is taken from 
the drama of " Caste," and is really the finest sketch ever pro-
duced upon the variety stage. 
Harry Osborne acting in the 
role of Old Eccles was really wonderful for so young a 
man, 
and could not be excelled, while Fanny Wentworth very natur-
ally and with great dramatic ability, displayed all the tender 
feeling of the young mother, the heartfelt anguish of the grief-
stricken wife, and the pride, spirit, and indignation of the 
whole-souled honorable woman.—Xew York Dispatch. 
ODEON, Newark.—Harry Osborne and Fanny Wentworth 
proved a 
great attraction here last evening in their mirth- pro-
voking sketch entitled " Courtship." 
They really are the most 
amusing Irish delineators, and possess a 
great deal of merry 
humor and original wit. 
Harry Osborne also produced a 
very 
laughable after-piece entitled, " The Unsophisticated Yankee," 
he himself sustaining the character of the old yankee greatly 
to the amusement and satisfaction of the audience. — Newark, 
Journal. 
CARTON'S VARIETIES, Williamsbrirgh.---Harry Osborne and 
Fanny Wentworth made their reappearance here last evening 
much to the pleasure and satisfaction of the audience, in a 
new and original sketch, introducing Lancashire Lad and 
(Welsh Lassie), a 
character never seen on the stage. 
Their 
business was as usual clever and refined. 
Osborne has many 
imitators but they are not Osborne.— Times. 
Harry Osborne and Fanny Wentworth are acknowledged to 
be the greatest and most versatile comedians and sketch artiste 
of the day.

An Irish lad and lassie 0,

Last night we went to Mick Moldoon's, 
We danced a 
double shutil 
And sorra one can do it like 
This dashing Irish couple. 
We sailed away fro : I

And crossed the briny seal ; 
So now we're here and settled down 
• 
In this free land—America. 
We've saved enough to buy the farm, 
And we are doing well yon see. 
So you are welcome for to call on us 
In a 
foreign part of sweet Jersey. 
So you see we are two thorough breds. 
Our likes you never scanned : 
For we are always happy, tear-a-nouns 
Is this lad and lass irom Ireland.

TWO THOROUGHBREDS FROM IRELAND 
Composed and sung with great success by HARRY OSBORNE 
and FANNY W ENTWORTH. 
On here we are two thoroughbreds, 
From Ireland all the way, 
We1et
'±-„at sparkling little isle, 
Her brooks and winding bays ; 
R7 -
1. ne'er forget the shamrock green 
grows upon thy shore, 
Not if centuries'thy freedom should restore. 
CHORUS. 
Machree, Machree, we long to see the day, 
Asthore, Asthore, the enemy to slay, 
And plant the flag of freedom 
With harp and shamrock bright, 
While we are marching to the fight boys. 
That was a 
glorious day of the patriots whose names 
Should emblazon every honored roll 
With glory and with fame; 
They are rescued from the tyrant's grip, 
Australia's fettered chains, 
So hurrah for the gallant boys, the Fenians. 
C !
TORUS, 
March on, March on, 
One victory is won; 
And yet we'll have that dear green Isle 
Restored to freedom's sons, 
This work we hope will soon be done.

WHERE CAN MY LITTLE BROTHER BE? 
Where can my little troller be. 
Why ever did he stray ? 
His loss has been a 
blow to me, 
hope he'll stay away; 
To bring him back, my love is such, 
I 
must some plan devise, 
My grief is when I 
think how much 
'Twill cost to advertise. 
Cnoaus. 
Where can my little brother ? 
Can he have gone away, 
To study hard at Botany, 
Afar in Botany Bay ? 
He's six feet high and very lean, 
His length's his chiefest charm, 
his boots are twelves, his gloves sixteens, 
lie's tatoo'd on his arm; 
Ills face a 
noble cast was deem'd, 
A 
cast his optics bore, 
Ills Roman nose turn'd up, mid seent'd 
To say Excelsior. 
CHORUS. 
Where can my little brother be ? 
Why ever did he stray ? 
His loss has been a 
blow to me, 
I'll hope he'll stay away. 
'Twas doubtful when I 
saw him, for 
His form was faint and dim ; 
You could not quite be sure which was, 
His shadow) which was him : 
His legs were like the pelican's, 
So tall he seemed indeed, 
With graceful neck, long as the swan's, 
A hop pole run to seed. 
Where can, etc. 
His voice it is a 
baritone. 
And if you heard him try 
To sing, I 
feel assured it N. OUld bring 
A 
tear into your eye ; 
His upper notes are like the lark's. 
His lower notes are groans; 
Perhaps the Negro Minstrels have 
Bought him up for bones. 
Where can, etc.

EMMET'S NO MORE, 
By HARRY OSBORNE. 
Sung with great success by FANNY 
W ENTWORTH. 
AIR: Exile of Erin. 
Despair in her wild eye, a 
daughter of Erin 
Appeared on the chit of a 
bleak rocky share, 
Loose in th wind flowed her dark streaming ringlets, 
As heedless she gazed on the dread surges' roar. 
Loud rang her harp in 
tones so despairing, 
The tune passed away with the present comparing, 
And in soul-thrilling strains deeper sorrow declaring, 
She sang Erin's wrongs, or my Emmet's no more. 
Oh Erin, my country, thy glory's departed, 
For tyrant's and traitors have stabbed thy heart's core. 
Thy daughter's now leave in the streams of affliction, 
Thy patriots are fled or lie stretched in their gore. 
Ruthless ruffians now prowl in thy hamlets forsaken, 
And from pale hungry orphans their morsel have taken, 
Yet the screams of thy females no pity awaken, 
Alas, my poor country, thy Emmet's no more. 
Brave was his spirit, yet mild as the brahmin, 
His heart bled in anguish at the wrongs of the poor, 
To relieve their liald sufferings he braved every danger, 
The vengeance of tyrants undauntedly bore. 
Even before him the proud titled villains in power 
Were seen, though in ermine, in terror to cower, 
But alas he is gone, he has fallen a 
young tl,)wer, 
They have murdered my Emmet, my Emmet's no more •

SHE WAS CLERK IN A 
CANDY STORE. 
Composed by FRED LINDEN.

Price 10 cents. 
THE other day, up by the square, 
I 
saw a 
pretty face, 
A 
pair of dancing sloe-black eyes, 
And actions full of grace ; 
In silks and velvets by the yard, 
In the fashion of the tkiy, 
Made up this charming little belle, 
Who stole my heart away. 
SPOREN.-- I 
was struck very bad; I 
bowed ; she bowed ; we 
both bowed . and ' twas not long before I 
found out— 
CHORUS. 
She was clerk in a 
candy store, 
She was clerk in a 
candy store, 
She was sweeter by far than the sweetest of sweets, 
Was this clerk of a 
candy store. 
And now we were the best of friends ; 
We chatted, laughed mud talked ; 
Her theme was candy, mine was love, 
As down the street we walked ; 
The best of friends must often part, 
I 
left my heart's delight, 
But promised we should meet again 
'Neath the dusky shade of night. 
SPOKEN. — Yes, at nine o'clock this evening, I 
home— 
was 
This clerk, etc. 
• 
to escort 
Tne twinkling stars shining bright, 
They seemed so full of life, 
Winked and nodded as I 
asked, 
If she would be my wife ; 
And as she gently murmured "yes," 
One year from this sweut night, 
They danced and sparkled as if to say 
We'll keep your pathway bright, 
She was clerk, etc.

Maggie darling, now, good bye, 
To America I 
go; 
It will nearly break my heart to leave you, 
And still I 
cannot live here so. 
I 
will nearly break my heart to leave you, 
Yet I 
must from old Ireland go. 
The old folks they are growing grey Maggie, 
The farm it wont support us all, 
I 
cannot stay and see them suffer. 
So I 
must go where duty 
CHORES, 
Maggie, dear Maggie dear, 
Oh ! should I 
never see thee more, 
My fondest hope is that you hive me, 
When you've loft old Ireland shore. 
Barney what will come of me 
When you are gone far, o'er the Main ? 
The birds will only sing in sadness, 
The sun will ne'er shine bright again: 
The birds will only sing in sadness, 
Till Barney comes back home again. 
Maggie, Barney feels ' tis hard to part, 
To leave his home and country too, 
But times are getting hard here, Maggie, 
And I 
must now find work to do. 
AIR: Remember you love in my prayers 
Composed by HARRY OSBORNE and sung with great success by 
FANNY W ENTWORTH. 
Oh, how often my mind retraces joy past, 
When childhood and youth knew no care, 
How I 
rambled with Kate, the pride of Newlas, 
Plucking wild flowers to wreath in her hair. 
How oft did our playmates stare at us and prate, 
In that ancient old town near the mill, 
When returning from rambles with) beautiful Kate. 
Seeing her home to that c ) t, at the hill, 
I 
remember how often her eyes they would beam, 
When I'd tell her a 
sweet tale of love, 
how my mind was enraptured with youth's happy dream, 
Oh how blest by our ruler above, 
Then oh shall we part from each other at last. 
Leave that love we bear fade with wili; 
Oh no I 
would seek for to moulder and pass 
In a 
grave at the foot of you hill

PARODY ON THE MAID AND MULETEER, 
Composed by HARRY OSBORNE and sung by HARRY and FANNY. 
We are an Irish pair as you can plainly see, 
I 
think all the world of her, she thinks the same of me:. 
Oh tell me, Patsy dear, who was that colleen bright 
Who was romping in the lane with you the other night. 
Oh please don't ask me that, for on paddle feet she goes, 
And I 
see her photo now, with that monstrous big nose. 
Oh Patsy be my friend, don't such compliment's extend, 
For you know that a great portion of that bugle you could 
lend. 
Do you say so, yes I 
say so. 
Oh then, sure, I 
love you well, but then for all that, 
To suit my taste you are too flat; 
Go away you great big ugly grey tom cat, 
The people know that you are that. 
Arrah, arrah, cushla gal machree, 
If you will only come with me 
We'll have a 
jolly spree. 
Oh Barney I 
can see with Blarney you're too free, 
You tould me yesterday that you would marry me. 
Oh Cathleen achree, I 
mean to marry thee, 
Then we will sail away from dear old Dublin Bay. 
No we cannot settle down in dear old Dublin town, 
So patsy we will go to a 
land where there's no foe. 
Yes darling we will happy be in that dear land of liberty, 
Yes glory into every son who followed 
Brave—George Washington. 
Oh then sure, &c.

W E 
are two funny characters, 
And the same you will allow, 
You will always find us tippling, 
And the last ones in a 
row: 
But when our Irish blood gets hot, 
And we pull the, cobeen o'er our face, 
You hear them quickly calling out, 
Let them alone for they are no brace. 
CHORUS. 
We are two dacint people, 
We stand as straight and firm 
As a 
wall or a.church steeple 
That no one can overthrow; 
So we are known by every one 
As two devils from below. 
Sure we are in for every party, 
Rallies, fairs, or wakes, 
And if there's any one too hearty, 
You can bet their pie is baked; 
For people look and stare at us, 
And say do now squeel low, 
For there at McGuffin's party 
Goes, them devils from below. 
We are two, &c.

OH, WHAT A 
DAY WE'RE HAVING, 
Sung by '
HARRY OSBORNE: A: 
FANNY W ENTWORTH. 
IF 
you'll listen I'll tell you what happened last week, 
Brown and I 
we went for our annual treat, 
And two pretty girls we happened to meet 
As we went to the palace at the park : 
The carriages all were as full as could be, 
So one pretty girl had to sit on my knee. 
And the other on Brown's, who shouted with glee, 
I 
say what a 
day we are having. 
Cuonus. 
Oh ! what a 
day we are having. I 
say ! 
Oh! what a 
day we are having, 
Enjoying ourselves with two pretty girls, 
I 
say what a 
day we are having. 
Our wives you must know we had both left at borne 
So of course Brown and I 
were entirely alone. 
And we thought that about with these girls we could roam, 
And no one be any the wiser ; 
We soon reached the Palace, the gardens went in, 
Play'd at kiss in the rin. drank brandy and gin, 
And some fellow smashed Brown's new hat right in, 
singing, oh ! what a 
day we are having. 
Oh ! what a 
day, etc. 
We all got as jolly as jolly could be, 
When Brown he proposed we should go and take tea, 
On this point the ladies ot course did agree, 
So away to the tables we started ; 
We ordered the tea, I 
had scarce taken my place, 
When a 
basin of slops was thrown in my face, 
And two voices shouted out, here's a 
disgrace; 
And a 
very nice day you are having. 
Oh! what a 
day, etc. 
We both wiped our faces, look'd up with surprise, 
When there t00d before us our two loving wives, 
Threat'ning to tear out those young ladies eyes, 
And they'd already torn off their bonnets. 
01 course Brown and I 
no longer could stay, 
And with our two wives walked meekly away, 
And some swells in the crowd shouted out, Here I 
say ! 
What a 
day you young scamps have been having. 
SPOKEN.—Yes, we had something to do, to square it with our 
wives, but Brown hit upon a 
happy thought, he proposed we 
should go to his house and finish the day. We did. He introduced 
the wine, we got jolly, Brown kissed my wife, I 
kissed his 
wife, then Brown said he would sing a 
comic song. This is what 
he sang— 
Oh! what a 
day we are having, I 
say, 
Oh! what a 
day we are having, 
Enjoying ourselves with our own proper girls, 
I 
say I 
what a 
day we are having.

Composed and sung with great success by HARRY OSBORNE. 
I 
am Pat O'Neil, an Irishman. 
Just from the county Clare,— 
As smart s 
any ever walked 
To country dance or fair, 
But poverty the poor man's lot, 
Drove me across the sea, 
To find a 
borne in this fair land 
Of sweet America. 
CHORUS. 
Many a 
noble minded man 
For refuge flew to thee ; 
Your ports are always open, 
Ever ready is your hand, 
To welcome here both great and small 
From dear old Ireland. 
When I 
was home 1 
often heard 
Of a 
country iar away, 
Where the rich and poor they both enjoy 
The same bright light or day ; 
Then my heart says rat don't work no more 
For nobles without pay, 
But go and gain your liberty 
In sweet America. 
Many a 
noble, etc. 
I'll not forget the noble flag, 
That guards our liberty,— 
Inviting those who are opposed, 
To come across the sea ; 
Hoping that the day may come 
When Ireland will be free,— 
I'll have you all to give three cheers 
For sweet America. 
Many a 
noble, etc.

AIII.—Dublin Carman. 
MY name is Denny Conner, I 
am a 
charcoal man, 
And if you will but listen, you'll see I'm an Irishman, 
I 
was born in Dublin City, that place of great renown, 
But now I'm here in America and peddling charcoal 
through the town. 
CHORUS. 
Charcoal is my cry, I 
make the old horse git, 
And if he does go slow you'll bet I 
use the whip, 
I 
fell in love with a 
nice young girl, her name was Rosy 
Ann, 
She said I 
was a 
genius and she'd have no other man; 
But now she's gone and left me, for a 
fellow by the name 
of McGee, 
Who peddles sawdust around the the city and my Rosy 
no more I'll see. 
Charcoal is my cry, & c. 
One day when they were riding the horse he took a 
fright, 
And ran away with Rosy and never stopped till night, 
He ran way up to Harlem Bridge, Rosy screamed with all 
her might, 
He npset the charcoal wagon and threw Rosy out of 
sight. 
Charcoal is my cry, &c. 
When McGee saw this cruel thing, it was more than he 
could stand, 
He drew out his 
land, 
So now I'm left alone, to lead 
And to peddle charcoal as ) 
wife.

I've been dining and wining to- day you can see, 
In a 
manner remarkably loose, 
And to go on a 
spree I 
know would suit me, 
For I 
mustn'n go home, ' tis no use. 
Oh I 
do feel so gay, so reckless and gay. 
My spirits so lively and spruce, 
I 
could sing or play in a 
juvenile way, 
For I 
do feel so awfully loose. 
CiaoEt's. 
I 
do feel so awfnlly loose, so loose, 
I 
do feel so awfully loose, so loose, 
Of course you can see I'm out on a 
spree, 
For I 
do feel so awfully loose, 
I 
was walking and talking along Broadway, 
And feeling decidedly loose, 
I 
was laughing and chaffing with ladies so gay, 
The excitement must plead my excuse, 
All at once I 
descried a 
girl by my side, 
And my heart went pit- pat like the deuce 
For I 
give you my word this would not haw vectored 
Had I 
not felt so awfully loose. 
I 
do feel. &c. 
Then to woo and to coo I 
embraced every chance 
In a 
style that was certainly loose, 
For I 
pressed her to go to the Argyle to dance, 
And really would take no excuse. 
I 
said Iwould be bliss if she gave me a 
kiss. 
And to raise her veil tried to induce, 
Who is that! on my life ! I've been courting my wife, 
Oh I 
did feel so awfully loose. 
I 
do feel, &c. 
Now what she said and I 
said may easily be guessed 
We both felt remarkably loose, 
The dispute grew so warm that I 
thought it the best 
To leave her by way of a 
truce. 
So I 
left her behind, and comfort I 
find 
In imbibing the generous juice; 
Oh I 
shall get it hot, but I 
don't care a 
jot, 
Feir to- night I 
am out on the loose. 
I 
do feel, S:e.

KIND friends I'm a

thing of the past, 
A 
poor faded flower that cannot long last, 
Tho' once I 
was jolly handsome and free, 
But my wife has quite settled rue. 
I 
thought when I

That I 
should be the happiest man the world had ever seen, 
But how to tell, this awful tale my blighted features scan, 
Then let me be a 
warning to (11(.11 unmarried man. 
SPOKEN —Yes, my happy single friends, look at me—a mar-

You see fin married, although a 
few months back 
was considered a 
sweet and interesting youth; but now they 
call me the " Caution."— 
Cnonns. 
I 
once was so handsome, rosy and gay, 
But now I 
am settled and faded away, 
In fact I 
was rakeish and called " Giddy Dan," 
Behold me a 
poor married man. 
No youth could be fairer than I 
used to be, 
The pride and hope of the whole family. 
The image of my mother, the pet of my dad, 
A 
sweei ' tempered, round shouldered lad ; 
My youthful hopes all vanisl'ed when ray litatt, vies stole

I 
thou.6ht Miss Green had money, but grieves me now to say, 
Se was ugly, lame and squinted, and tall as a 
Giraffe, 
My friends instead of pitying me th. y 
only jeer and laugh. 
SPOKEN—Yet she never treated me to a 
jam tart, or a 
penny 
valentine; all she thinks about is reading all the high class 
novels, • Jack Shoppard," " The Road to Ruin," " The New-
gate Calendar," " Sketches" by Turpin and Calcraft, and 
other eminent authors ; whilst I—poor Bounce! she cans me 
"Boggy"—has to do the

THERE'S a 
charming young fellow now roaming about, 
Who loves all the girls in h:s way; 
They say he's a " catch " but of that there's a 
doubt, 
For a 
single young man he will stay! 
He flirts, and sighs, and tells such lies, 
Each one is sure she has a 
prize ; 
And he has such a 
naughty way 
That one girl to another will say: 
Beware! Beware! Beware! 
CHORUS. 
He isn't a 
marrying man, my love, 
He lives on a 
different plan, my love, 
Keep out of his way, if you can, my love, 
For lie isn't a 
marrying man ! 
There's old Mrs. Brown with a 
daughter so sweet, 
She thought him an excellent beau, 
She allowed Mary Jane his attentions to meet, 
And told her to never say no! 
But then there came a " mutual friend," 
With tales that seemed to have no end, 
These warning words she heard with pain : 
" 
Believe me what I 
say, Mary Jane, 
'Beware! Beware! Beware! 
Chorus.—He isn't, etc. 
He dresses with care and he's known everywhere, 
lie goes with the rich and the poor ; 
Sometimes he will drive a 
poor girl to despair, 
Till she thinks his affections are sure; 
But, by and by, away he will fly, 
And there she's left to droop and sigh, 
With sympathetic voices near 
To whisper these words in her ear: 
" 
Beware! Beware! Beware !" 
Chorus.— He isn't, etc. 
Sung by Miss JENNIE ENGEL. 
HOW many things so wanting, now I 
very often say, 
I 
would supply with pleasure, if I 
only had my way! 
Apart from help to needy souls, and " 
to struggling friends, 
I'd give some follies that I 
know their just deserts and ends, 
have the honest aided and the weary hearts made gay; 
And idleness turn'd begging if I 
only had my way! 
CHORUS. 
If I 
only had my way! if I 
only had my way! 
I'd do all sorts of wonders if I 
only had my way! 
I'd have the earnest worker paid his credit and his due, 
Nor have the toil of many made the pleasure of the few! 
I'd put a 
tax on bachelors, and have some husbands know 
Their proper place at home and let some idle woman go, 
I'd be reven.g'd on all that's mean, I'd make all debtors pay, 
I'd do all sorts of wonders if I 
only had my way'

You've heard of the Lakes of Killarney, 
So sparkling, so pure and clear; 
And sure, without one word of blarney, 
There's none that I 
love so dear. 
And in those sweet, romantic dells, 
I've rambled day by day; 
'Tis there where saucy echo dwells! 
And I 
so love to stray. 
CHORUS. 
Down by Killarney Lake! 
There many strolls I'd take ; 
Passing time away, so happy light and gay, 
Down by Killarney Lake! 
The blossom of the flowers look neater 
Than those that you elsewhere see; 
The songs of the birds sound sweeter 
Than other birds to me. 
The Emblem of dear Erin's Isle! 
Blooms fresh and fairer there! 
Its Shamrock smiles its welcome, to 
Killarney's Lakes, so fair!

UNDER THE ROSE BUSH, 
Sung with great success by Miss CARRIE DUNCAN, at Tony Pas-
tor's theatre. 
WHEN eighteen years old, and just growing bold 
Of me cupid made quite a 
happy young bride 
By shooting his dart through, and sending my heart to 
A gentleman stranger, whom I 
had espied 
Reclining at leisure, enjoying his pleasure 
Beneath the light rose-bush full burdened with bloom 
So kindly he pressed me, and gently addressed me 
Remarking, look here, miss, there's plenty of room. 
CIICRUS. 
Under the rose- bush, under the rose-bush, 
Picking the clover and picking the way, 
Under the rose- bush, under the rose- bush, 
He asked me to kiss him. I 
did not say nay. 
Of modesty heedless, in fact it was needless, 
We sat by the side of that May-bedecked hedge, 
heard his confession of love and depression, 
He asked for a 
kiss in exchange for the pledge, 
I 
never denied it, but then and there tried it, 
Beneath that bright- rose bush full burdened with bloom, 
So like the May flowers, which served as a 
bower, 
It seemed quite as sweet as the lovely perfume. 
Under the rose-bush, kc. 
At sun's early dawning, I 
went there each morning 
To meet my romantic and strangely met swain, 
All mystery was banished, nil secrecy vanished 
Dear Ned vowed he'd love me again and again. 
*We do not like walking, we much prefer talking 
Beneath that bright rose-bush, full burdened with bloom, 
So when to the altar I 
went without falter 
I 
had my dear Ned for a 
happy bridQgroom.

THE AMERICAN FLAG. 
Mn. FRANK LEWIS' Great Original Song, as Sung by him 
over 100 times, in New York and Philadelphia. 
Wonderful that glorious emblem, boys, the banner of the free, 
The stars and stripes which brightly wave, supreme o'er land and sea 
It floated proud when nations tried to drag it through the mire, 
It filled brave men in every clime with patr,otic fire. 
It shed its radiance through the world on Concord's Village Grvolt! 
Wherever Liberty, it shines, that emblem can be seen. 
It stood on Bunker's Mountain Coast, where Warren nobly die(1, 
And in the cause of Freedom boys, it all the world defied. 
It spread its folds at Valley Forge, 'mid storm of rain and snow; 
It floated proud at Trenton, boys, where prostrate lay the foe; 
O'er Washington it placed its wings, as in the boat he stood, 
When bold the Delaware he crossed, and braved its angry flood. 
It brightly waved at Dallymount, when Gildersleeve he shot; 
When Bodine, Fulton, and the rest, the golden prizes got; 
And when the Cumberland went down 'mid screams of wild despair, 
It proudly floated o'er the wreck, undaunted still was there. 
ts folds protected Sheridan when he did swiftly ride; 
,It went with Sherman to the sea, when he to conquer tried. 
Defending it young Ellsworth fell, and free without a 
stain. 
It spread out its victorious stripes with Scott at Lundy's Lane. 
It went with Rough and Ready against a 
foreign foe ; 
Its shadow spread destruction o'er the plains of Mexico: 
And down with Jackson, in the South, behind his cotton bales, 
That starry emblem was unfurled ' till victory prevailed. 
It floats on every foreign shore, our own beloved flag! 
And curses light on him, my boys, who low its folds would drag; 
On sea, that emblem, far and wide, is worshipped bY our tars; 
On land each Freedom's loving Son does bless its Stripes and Stars! 
But brighter, boys, it•ne'er did shine, than when the people all, 
Met on the Fourth of last July, in Independence Hall— 
And raised that banner to the clouds with loud triumphant cry— 
That just one hundred years had passed, since it did the world defy.

KATE O'BRIEN. 
OH.! 
Kate O'Brien is my name, 
I'll tell you boys from whence I 
came, 
Old Ireland is the place I 
claim, 
And I'm an Irish girl. 
No Country is more dear to me, 
Than the little isle stands in the sea. 
Where boys and girls are gay and free, 
Deny it if you can. 
Sure old Ireland's the place, 
That there's fame for fun and mirth, 
Its equals you cannot find, 
And search all o'er the earth. 
Good-natured boys and girls there, 
With few of them you can compare, 
Their hearts and minds are free from care, 
That makes an Irish- man. 
CHORUS. 
Then Kate O'Brien is my name 
I'll tell you boys, from whence I 
came. 
Old Ireland is the place I 
claim, 
And I'm an Irish girl. 
Oh Dan O'Connel, Ireland's friend, 
He struggled hard her to defend 
Vainst all invaders who did intend 
To crush poor Paddy's land, 
He always proved poor Paddy's friend 
When on his trial he did attend, 
And made the noblest back to bend, 
To the honest Irishman. 
In the high court of justice, 
He made them all to stare, 
With his learning, wit, and humor, 
To hear him it was rare. 
May peace and plenty ever be, 
In our little isle stands in the sea, 
Then let the toast be Ireland free, 
And you'll all be happy men. 
Then Kate O'Brien, &e. 
In Eighteen forty-eight gone by 
The Irishmen they had to fly, 
For famine stood in every eye 
Along old Grannia's shore; 
Thousands to America did sail 
Leaving their wives and babes to wail, 
They were determined they would not fail, 
But their hardships undergo. 
The Harp that once through Tara's Halls, 
Its cord shall strike again, 
And welcome back the exile 
From across the stormy main. 
May peace and plenty ever be, 
In that little isle stands in the sea, 
Then let the toast be Ireland free, 
And you'll all be happy men.

The sweetest of these fellows 
Has a

And has, to match a

A 
head of curly hair; 
He has the whitest pearly teeth, 
And when he casts a

easily 
Could kiss him all the while. 
I

Oh, could I

He meets all around him a 
frown! 
Then reckless and sad, he " goes to the bad," 
Because he is kick'd when he's down! 
How kindly the world smiles upon him, 
When life with successes abounds ; 
How blandly each neighbor will greet him, 
As in pleasure he's riding around; 
:Cut then let reverse overtake him, 
And his friends both in country and town, 
:mace not ti kind sentence to cheer him, 
But will kick him as soon as he's down 
When poor and aitrAsy, 
Let a 
man get position and riches, 
No matter by right or by fraud; 
The world nods approvingly on him, 
And loudly his creatures applaud; 
But just let him lose all his treasures, 
Tho' before he was full of renown, 
The people find out he has fallen, 
And then let him die when he's down! 
When poor and astray, &c... 
Oh! why is all mankind so selfish ? 
We know it should never be thus! 
Then why can't we do to our neighbors 
As we would have them do to us ? 
And if in adversity's ocean 
We are sinking, and ready to drown, 
Twice blest is the friend whose devotion 
Will help a 
man up when he's clown. 
When poor and astray, r!:-

TURN DOWN THE GAS. 
Words by the lovely Vocalist, JENI•rrz LINDSAL 
Dedicated to my friend EURRY BRaiNE'rr. 
You have all heard the song of Pull down the blind, 
But another I'll sing just as good, you will find; 
Now, Wipe off your chin, I 
believe is the last, 
But I 
have one still later, 'tis Turn down the gas 
Now, I 
loved a 
young man so charming and gay, 
Who came round to see me most every day; 
When we'd kiss and embrace, to me he would say— 
Turn down the gas! Turn it down right away! 
SPOKEN.—Yes, he was a 
darling fellow; whenever he, 
came to my house to see me, it was always when Pa and. 
Ma were gone to meeting; he would put his arm round, 
my neck and say, Jennie, darling--
Clionus. 
Turn down the gas! Tura down the gas! 
Darken the room, love, there's a 
dear lass : 
Though we love each other, remarks may be pass'd, 
So come kiss your Harry and—Turn down the gas! 
My Harry's a 
darling, you can see at a 
glance, 
And don't he look sweet in his new lavender pants; 
He sings like a 
bird, and oh! can't he dance! 
If you saw him waltzing why you'd go in a 
trance, 
For such style as his was never seen yet— 
He's King of the Fashion, now don't you forget. 
We are going to be married, and I'll never regret 
When I 
turned down the gas for my dear darling pet. 
SPOKEN.—Iiarry and I 
have been keeping company for 
over a 
year, and mother says it's time he proposed. 
I 
think so too. 
He says he will marry me before the Cen-
tennial is over. 
At any rate, I 
hope he loves me just as 
well as when he first courted me, and with a loving 
squeeze told inc to please— 
Turn down the gai, r' &at.,

I'm Such a 
Modest Young Man. 
SERIO-COMIC SONG. 
Composed and sung by GEORGE HARRIS, the great Centennial 
Vocalist. 
-4ir .—" Belie of the Ball." 
The darling of all the fair charmers, 
I 
am such a 
bashful young man, 
Too bashful I'm sure for to harm one, 
From danger like that I've oft ran. 
The night I 
was born, they told me 
That my modesty could not be worse, 
I 
would not let my mother behold me, 
And hid all my charms from the nurse. 
SPOKEN.—Yes, I 
was born bashful. 
Most babies generally 
cry when they make their first appearance. 
All I 
did was to 
blush, for— 
CHORUS. 
I'm such a 
modest young man, I 
am, 
I'm such a 
modest young man, I 
be, 
Don't look at me, for I 
blush, you see, 
I'm such a 
modest young man. 
Of course I 
can never get married, 
Too bashful to ask for a 
wife, 
My hopes—as a 
father— is buried, 
Condemned to live single thro' life. 
No helpmate to comfort and cherish, 
No baby to hold on my knee; 
With shame I 
should certainly perish 
If the thing was suggested to me! 
SPOKEN. —I 
was very near getting married once; but when 
I 
commenced thinking of what would come after, you can bet 
my courage gave way. I 
don't know how these married folks 
manage; I'll sure if it ever should fall to my lot to—to—well, 
you know bater than I 
do—I 
should certainly sink through 
the floor, for— 
I'm such a 
modest young man, <to. 
Therrst " pull-back' I 
saw, made me dizzy, 
At an ankle I 
faint right:away; 
A 
striped stocking it sets me crazy, 
And I'm fit for no more thro' the day. 
As ladies walk past when its raining, 
And lift up the skirt gliding by, 
If a 
view underneath I'm obtaining, 
I 
vow I 
am ready:to die. 
SPOKEN.—And the more they show—the more palpitating I 
get! A 
dashing young feminine once fainted in my arms; she 
wore a 
low-necked dress l 
and the sight I 
then beheld so un. 
nerved me, that I 
have never recovered my proper firmness 
since, for— 
I 
am such a 
modest young man, &c. 
I 
would die at the sight of a 
bustle, 
Though to some it is exquisite bliss; 
It would weaken the strength of my muscle 
Should a 
female attempt me to kiss! 
So girls, I 
do now give you warning— 
Don't you think that I 
ever would wed ; 
I 
should leave you alone before morning— 
With the pillow to grasp in my stead! 
SPOKEN.—I 
never could overcome the sensation! To be a 
married man would use me up completely. 
I'm too bashful, 
you know—in fact— 
I'm such a 
modest young man, &..c. 
MULDOON'S PARTY. 
46 
Sung by JAMES O'NEIL. 
It was last week Muldoon gave a 
party, 
The gang in great numbers were stuffs, 
When O'Reilly, N. G., and McCarty 
Sung an Irish song called the " Two Toughs." 
Pete Doolan was lush and got cranky, 
And swore he saw " blood on the moon," 
When Mulcahy's Irish got worked up, 
And knocked the tar out of Muldoon. 
SPOKEN.—Ye's talk about good-lookin' girls! there was Mat. 
cahy's sick daughter; she was as party as a 
pig ! 
And the 
whiskey—they use it on the Boulevard to blast rocks with! 
O'Reiley's wife asked me to dance a 
reel with her—I 
got a 
breeze from her breath and I 
reeled on the door. 
CHORUS. 
But here is success to the party, 
The Clipper then tapped a 
fresh keg, 
The bung hit Miss Eugene McCarty. 
And she danced the cancan on oae leg. 
When the music struck up I 
got crazy. 
The gang made a 
rush for to dance, 
Said Muldoon to O'Reiley, •' be 17.i.sy, 
For he's got on his tra-la-lee pants." 
" 
He is lookin' for graft" said McCarty. 
" 
Throw him out" said a 
cberry faced bloke, 
" 
He is too fresh" and the girls they laughed hearty, 
And O'Malley said •• go sab the coat '." 
1
, I 
SPOKEN.-" Here," said I 
to Uuldoon, 
Lin no Italian, and 
I'll have no more of it; I 
came here to enjoy myself. 
Said 
O'Reilly—" they're only givin' you a 
guy," • I'm no sailor." 
Every mother's son now take a 
skip, 
I 
see that you're all on the guy, 
For I'm bound to hold on to my grip, 
And I 
danced ' ronnd the room like a 
fly. 
The gang, nearly starved, made a 
rush, 
For the table they made very quick, 
nere was pigs' feet, red herrin's and mush, 
3e the Heavens they made it look sick. 
O'Malley filled up on red lierrin's, 
Whin they carried him out nearly dead. 
0' Reilly's sick daughter she fainted, 
AA was carried in pieces to bed. 
SPOLEN.—Tes, they all commenced looking for fight, and 
their brains were crazed with whiskey. 
Chairs, tables, stove. 
pipes and !amps were fiyin' around the room, which broke up 
the party. I 
bid Muldoon good- night, and went home. 
All the next day I 
laid in me bed, 
With a 
plaster stuck under my chin, 
And an iron hoop bound round me head 
To keep down the whiskey and gin!

ALWAYS THINK BEFORE YOU SPEAK. 
Sung by George Hard. 
MY advice, if it you seek, 
Is but simple in its way, 
Ere you ope your mouth to speak, 
Think of what you're going to say; 
Hurried words will oft cause pain, 
Where you would not wound at all, 
Then repentance comes in vain, 
For the speech you can't recall. 
C HORtS. 
Always think before you speak. 
Words are strong when judgment's weak, 
If you friendship's hand would see, 
Think before you speak, boys. 
When a 
maiden's hand is sought, 
And she's asked if she will wed, 
Oft without a 
second thought, 
Is the answer quickly said; 
Be it yea, or be it nay. 
Ere a 
year or two have passer:, 
Often do--• 
she rue the day. 
That her tonmie ran on so fasl. 
Alcrays think, ita. 
From a 
rash and hasty speech, 
Quarrels often will arise, 
Weigh your words, then, I 
beseech, 
If a 
quiet life you prize 
Then when you those words recall, 
And you've put them to the test, 
You will own that after all, 
Second thoughts are always best. 
Always think. lee 
Thoughtless men will talk until, 
They forget what they have said, 
Po you know, the toligue that's still. 
Often shows the wisest head , 
Time and words they only waste, 
With their tongue's unceasing flow, 
Those who always speak in haste, 
Very seldom wisdom show. 
Always think, Scc.

THE HONEST WORKING CLASSES 
An Original Song by Mr. Fr.INK LEWIS. 
How the world has wrote the pi aises of our politicaus of fame, Sir— 
And balls and suppers given them in honor of their name, Sir. 
The Poets, too, have sung of them, and such kind favor passes ; 
But none have sung in praise of our honest working classes. 
There's many a 
battle has been won by those who get no thanks Sir; 
The tide of victory Olt been turned by the solid poor man's rank Sir: 
Where would they be, these nabobs and dictators of the masses, 
If it was not for the solid votes of our honest working classes. 
The honest, brown face working man, with his hands so tough and 
hard, Sir, 
A 
trudging to his daily toil, is the noblest work of God, Sir. 
IsTo Duke's or Earl's fine silver plate, e'er equals or surpasses 
The homely, plain tin dinner pails of our honest working classes. 
Now, I 
think it would be about as well, for those high up in office, 
To try and help the poor man. and feed his empty coffers— 
Take the money that they spend for wine, big suppers and fine 
dashes, 
And feed the starving children of our honest working classes. 
There's the newsboys and the bootblacks, often sick, poor and for-
lorn, Sir, 
They meet the ignorant snob's contempt, the haughty rich man's 
scorn Sir; 
But some may go to Congress, and there control the masses— 
A 
noble representative of oui honest working classes. 
sow, there are good men, brave and true, who represent our nation 
And who will not be offended at any insinuations: 
There are some, by deeds have earned their names, not by gold or 
clink of glasses, 
But have nobly risen, step by step, from our honest working classes

Words and Music by T. E. PowRas. 
As sung by MAXWELL & REYNOLDS. 
It was on a 
Saturday night 
That we started a 
Company, 
And elected Anthony Wright, 
Our Captain to be; 
He accepted office with thanks, 
And appointed us Pioneers 
For to march in front of the ranks, 
In the Hoolahan Musketeers! 
CHORUS. 
We march like soldiers thro' the streets, 
With our new flags flying so gay, 
And bate the time wid both our feet, 
While the band did sweetly play; 
From windows high the girls did look, 
And they smiled at the Pioneers, 
And then their handkerchiefs they shook, 
At the Hoolahan Musketeers. 
To the guests invited we gave 
All the prizes to carry round. 
And at nine o'clock we did lave, 
For to go to the shooting ground, 
Where we stopp'd for two hours or more; 
And we toasted the Pioneers, 
aad eating and drinking galore, 
Did the Hoolahan Musketeers ! 
We march'd, &e, 
But when we got back to the Ward, 
It was then we felt light and gay ; 
And our Captain flourish'd his sword, 
While the crowd did lave the way ; 
At Monahans we broke up then, 
And faith, we gave three hearty cheers, 
For the officers and the men. 
In the Hoolahan Musketeers!

Words by " M ORGAN." 
Music by J. R. THOMAS. 
As sung by JENN'IE M ORGAN. 
Music to be had of OLIVER DITSON k. CO., Boston, Mass., Priee 40ota. 
You call me sweet and tender names, 
And softly smooth my tresses, 
And all the while my happy heart 
Beats time to your caresses. 
You love me in your tender way, 
I 
answer as you let me ; 
But ah ! there comes another day, 
The day when you'll forget me, 
The day when you'll forget me. 
I 
know that ev'ry fleeting hour 
Is marked by thoughts I 
bring you, 
I 
know there dwells a 
subtle pow'r 
In the sweet songs I 
sing you. 
I 
do not fear the darkest way, 
With those dear arms about me, 
Ah! no, I 
only dread the day 
When you can live without me, 
When you can live without me. 
And still you call me tender names, 
And softly smooth my tresses; 
And still my happy answ'ring heart 
Beats time to your caresses. 
Hush! let me put that touch away, 
And clasp your hands above me; 
So while I 
ask to die that day, 
The day you will not love me. 
The day you will not love me. 
You need not check the thoughts that rise 
With darkness wrapt about them, 
For gazing in your earnest eyes, 
My heart can almost doubt them. 
Yet hush my whispers as you may, 
Such chidings do not fret me; 
Ah! no, I 
only fear that day, 
The day when you'll forget me, 
The day when you'll forget me.

IN THE BOWERY, 
TONT PASTOR'S Great Sensational Song. 
Am—" 
[This song has been called for nightly for mouths in succession, 'hay.-
ing been sung by Mr. PAs .ron in his own inimitable style, and been 
received with thunders of applause. 
SOME say that Central Park's the place, 
For fun of every kind; 
On Broadway and Fifth Avenue 
Much pleasure others find. 
But I'm a 
different sort of chap 
No fun in that I 
see, 
For when I 
want enjoyment 
The Bowery for me. 
SPOKEN.—Yes, you may talk about your Broadway belles, 
your Fifth Avenue swells, your exquisitely-dressed creatures, 
with their lavender kids, and their la-de-da's, now, what do 
they know about enjoyment? 
They are afraid to go in for a 
little fun for fear of disarranging their toilets: and then what 
would Mrs. Grundy say ? " Charles Frelerick Augustus is get-
ting decidedly vulgar; Seraphina, Emelia is positively shock-
ing !" 
But here in the Bowery people enjoy themselves just 
when they feel like it. 
They don't care a 
curse what others may 
say, for that's the custom. 
Cnonus. 
In the Bowery, in the Bowery, 
For beautiful girls with bright eyes and dark curls, 
In the Bowery, in the Bowery, 
That's where I 
reside when I'm home. 
No butterflies of fashion there, 
Or idlers may be found, 
66 
But men with open hearts and hands, 
With honest labor browned; 
Men who to help a 
friend in need, 
Would their last dollar lend, 
Who never live on other folks, 
But earn the cash they spend. 
SPOKEN. — Yes, there is no place in the Bowery for those well-
dressed corner statues to try to look like millionaire's sons, while 
their mothers are out scrubbing for a 
dollar a 
day to support 
them in idleness. 
A fellow has no business on the east 
side of town unless he wants to work and earn his own living. 
What fortune is there more honorable than that of a 
working 
man. 
There was Washington, he was a 
farmer, and Franklin a 
printer. 
Warren a 
doctor. 
Andy Johnson a 
tailor. 
Abe Lin-
coln a 
rail-splitter, and Grant a 
tanner. 
If you want to see 
men who make our country great, who add to her wealth, de-
velop her resources, maintain her strength and prosperity, you 
will always find them— 
In the Bowery, ;lc. 
The other day a 
well-dressed fop, 
While walking through the street, 
Insulted a 
poor working girl, 
With whom he chanced to meet 
A 
young mechanic came along, 
And heard the words he said 
He soon pitched in to the fop 
And on him put a 
head. 
SPOKEN. — Tes, he laid the cowardly rascal nut. " Now," 
says, ""git up and git, and if I 
ever catch you insulting a 
fernak-, 
again ni add a 
French roof to that head I've put on you. 
The dandy quietly sneaked away: the young lady turned to her 
57 
preserver, with tears in her eyes, and said; " My dear sir, how 
can I 
ever thank you for the kindness which you have shown 
me in protecting me from the insults of that ruffian and I 
hope 
sir, we shall meet again. 
Do you live near here ? 
Certainly, 
young lady. I'm always found— 
In the Bowery, Icc. 
When dark rebellion raised its head, 
And war o'er-spread the land, 
When rushed unto Columbia's aid 
Each gallant hero band, 
Among the foremost on the field, 
Amid the battle's noise, 
Upholding still our starry flag; 
Was found the Bowery boys. 
SPOKEN—When the call came for soldiers in the hour of dan-
ger, the Bowery was the first to send its volunteers, and nobly 
did they do their duty, 
Who does not remember that incident 
at the battle of Antietam, when the enemy charged in full force, 
one brave regiment bravely stood its ground, under a 
terrific 
fire and changed the tide of seeming defeat to one of glerious 
victory. 
This was noticed by General McClellan, who ex-
claimed; " What regiment is this?" " New York Volunteers," 
was the ar3wer. " Where do they hail from?" Why, of course

THE BUSY B'S. 
An Original Song, as Sung by FRANK LEWIS, with im-
mense success. 
A 
strange name for my song I've selected, 
But still I 
will try you to please ; 
They are men of bad deeds been suspected, 
And I'll call them the great Busy B's. 
Now it's simply because that same letter, 
Is the one that commences their name ; 
So I 
took it for want of a 
better— 
They are men of renown and great fame. 
CHORUS. 
Now Belzebub was the first B, sir, 
He made Eve steal the fruit from the tree, sir; 
Caused mankind its shame first to see sir, 
He was the most wonderful B. 
Belshazzar one day gave a 
dinner, 
And invited his Senators, all ; 
But he found he was scarcely a 
winner, 
When the writing appeared on the wall. 
Brigham Young gets his wives by the hundred, 
He's babies, I'm told, by the score ; 
But not satisfied, the old rascal, 
He is constantly wishing for more. 
CHORUS. 
Ben Butler with one eye does see sir— 
He goes that same eye on a 
fee sir— 
He is a 
most comical B, sir, 
That ever this nation did see. 
Mr. Beecher, to the people still preaches, 
Giving sly winks at each pretty Miss ; 
Henry Bowen says bad things he teaches • 
He is best at a 
sweet fragrant kiss. 
Spain speaks of apologies ?-iven— 
Will that bring the dead back to life ? 
Will that aid the wives and the children 
Of the victims who fell in the strife ? 
CHORUS. 
We want Burril, the butcher, on high, sir, 
On a 
gibbet that shall reach the sky, sir 
Like the men he has murdered, to die, sir; 
Not till then will we listen to Spain. 
Mr. Blaine is a 
B 
that was Speaker, 
He hails from away down in Maine; 
For the chair in the White House, a 
seeker, 
No fool of a 
B, was old Blaine. 
Mr. Babcock, the gay and the frisky, 
Is a 
B 
that went in for the tin; 
He made his small pile out of whiskey— 
But stealing by law is no sin. 
CHORUS. 
Boss Tweed and Boss Shephard, so great, sir, 
Made cash at a 
tremendous rate, sir ; 
Our currency went to inflate, sir— 
These men were such Busy B's. 
But the worst B 
of all in the nation, 
Who late did his pockets well fill— 
Is the one from the poor soldier's ration 
Did steal what he could at Fort Sill. 
Aaron Burr, we are told, was a 
Traitor— 
For his country he did not care a 
rap ; 
Though, peihaps his proud soul did hate her— 
Was he worse than our General Belknap?

For now I'm candidate for Presidint,

Whin Malone this land is rulin' ? 
Won't I

tinf rtunately, there is enough 
of it done without any further necessity of explaining " hoe', when and 
'where to do it," and this little volume would advise and initiate the un-
corrupted in practicing what is commonly called "flirting." 
The N. •Jr. Eeeving Telegram writes: " We have lately seen a neat little 
book, bound in Morocco leather, co ding twenty-five ( cuts, called the 
"Little Flirt," published by A. J. F.surin, No. telo Nassau street. 
It 
gives information of the modus cp rat:di of fliot ing, and of the meaning 
of every motion of the handkerchief, fan, glove and parasol.

is nothing at all objectio...able in the v. dome, and its contents might af-

four rows, and are to be read according to directions. 
Many of the an-
swers depend upon the position certain cards bear to other cards. The 
method of playing is somewhat complicated, but the directions have 
been made so that very little study will suffice to an ordinary under-
standing.

Courting Cards.—This Series of Cards has been arranged 
to meet a 
want frequently felt by young people—a want of means of 
expressing one's sentiments in such a way as to be non-committal. 
Many young ladies are visited by gentlemen who are either too diffi. 
dent or too fearful of a 
repulse, to venture upon asking the momentous 
question. The lady is restrained, by custom and a 
sense of propriety, 
from doing anything that would seem to be an unlady-like encourage-
ment. As a 
result of this dilemma, many 
lives are spent as an unloved 
tedious existence, which might have been prolonged and enjoyed in the 
happiness of matrimony. This pack of Cards will overcome the diffi-
culty, and being in the shape of questions and answers, will cover every 
phase of courtship. 
The sentiments conveyed therein need not be 
adopted by the parties to the game as their own, unless it accords with 
the state of their affections, which fact makes further explanation un-
necessary. The playing of these Cards is not restricted to two players, 
,. but may be enjoyed by evening parties
