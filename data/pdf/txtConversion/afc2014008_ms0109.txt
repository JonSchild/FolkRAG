SUBJECT:
 Proposed festival foot: plan for 1
`76  (
as requested)
 
Consultation with the Program Coordinators confirms =
"y earlier--stated
 
objections to the food service furnished ny GSI.
 These include:
 
failure to provide requested menus
 
poor quality food - lukewarm and tasteless
 
monoP lization of most profitakle food ite ms
 
high prices
 
slovenly and inefficient aervice
 
in fact, there is no area of food service in which GSI meets even minimum
 
standards except for the doling out of calories to a large number.
 
This is a situation of real concern.
 There is no culture in the
 
world in which food dons not have meanings far beyond its ;
physiological
 
function; and one of t
?.e hallmarks of ritual and celebrational activity
 
everywhere is the consumption of special and festive food.  Therefore,
 
regardless of either our or GSI 's  intentions, food is an intrinsic
 
mart of our nro�ram and must be apnroachea at that level.
 
-
 .
_
_
.
 
Each item of food and drink served is a communication with the
 
Festival goer -
-
- a statement concerning the social context (this is a
 
party, a good time, different from every-day), a particular cultural
 
group (we're Native Americans and isn't our fry bread terrific) or a
 
googra-phic area  (
this is California and here's wherq the olives grow
 
on trees).
 When we serve such tacky and tepid concoctions as mass-
produced "honey dint fried chicken" or water--lodged half--ears of corn,
 
the stated message is that we are producing merely another run--of-the--
mill rip--off event.
 
As a symbolic substance, food seems to operate on two levels.
 
First,  it says who you are;  it is a form of personal identification.
 
The strength of this emotional identification goes far beyond the
 
simple requirements of nutrition, a very clear example occurring during
 
the 1375 Festival when the Italians refused to rat at all until they
 
were provided with pasta.
 quite literally,  the Italian contingent were
 
identifying themselves as pasta consumers;  if the appropriate food wasn't
 
present,  the Italians wouldn't be either.
 The second way that food
 
operates may, however, be of even greater irsportance in Festival
 
management:
 food says what we think of you.
 At a runner party. one
 
can serve hamburgers or steak:  the nutritional content is about the
 
-2-
same, but the -
message to the guest is different.
 It is interesting
 
to speculate on the menu the director of OSI serves guests at his home.
 
Mass-produced food, then , conveys a mass message.
 If we are
 
forced for logistical reasons to handle a part of our food sererice on
 
a mass basis , then our strategy should be to look to those occasions
 
when :
'
americans get together in large numbers for really convivial
 
activities and select which of those occasions and their associated
 
cuisines most closely reflect the spirit and concerns of our Festival.
 
Ball park hot dogs are a case in point.
 '
thousands of people at our
 
major league games consume well-fl&vtored and tasty franks. the hot dog
 
is, indeed, so closely associated with the self--image of the United
 
States that during the thirties the Roosevelts served red hots to the
 
visiting King and Queen of England at a White s
'
iouse picnic.  Here is
 
a mass-produced and mass--distributed !
good item which means, to most
 
2
-mericans, good times, a kind of youthful nostalgia, and a public
 
occasion (
since the ball park hot dog is unreproductible in the dome
 
kitchen) .
 
Mon- mass produced food, on the other hand, conveys a non-sass
 
message.
 It speaks of home, or conjures up the place one hopes to
 
visit one day.  Wherefore, the Festival should include a number of
 
small food services offering regional or ethnic foods.  These rust be
 
;
prepared by specialists from the area or national group involved;
 
mass-nroduced imitations such as the taco ?
latter or the German
 
sausage and sauerkraut offered by GSI this past summer are so far
 
below the standards set by our general program as to he demeaning.
 
The United States produces a
. variety of foodstuffs unparalleled
 
in other areas of the world.  We o
urs our many visitors in 1976 the
 
opportunity to wander through the restival sampling this bounty,
 
visiting fresh-squeezed juice bars and sweet corn stands, hot tamale
 
and roast chestnut vendors, with occasional aide trips to pick up
 
some barbecued chicken or a really find ice crease cone.
 The
 
popularity of the .
Axabbers should convince us of the value, salability
 
and plain goodness of the many t ees of hand-held foods we would offer.
 
In summing up the many staff suggestions, the following pattern
 
for food service has emerged as our ultimately desired scheme:
 
1
.
 One, or at most  two, large structures serving carni val food
 
(
hamburgers and the like).
 
In Regional, Native Americans, Old gays and Diaspora, !
n
erc�ium-
sized food-dispensing .
structures equipped to produce full-plate
 
(
complete  s
eal) .
services of regional or ethnic foods, staffed by
 
competent cooks fx =
,
, the regions or ethnic group  involved.
 
_3-
3
.
 In Working Americans .
and the Childrens area, program-related smaller
 
food services -- coffee, '
pie or doughnuts in working americans;
 
juice, s
i3ild-sized sandwiches, etc. in the Childrens area
 
4
.  Throughout the Festival, a variety of push-cart or individual
 
boot's servers of first-class hand-held foods.  These should be
 
mobile carts or small stands selling one or at most two food
.
 
ite ms (ice cream cones, f
iat sweet earn, juice, etc).
 
W i€s may slee
t n aini.stratively complex; however, it is an extension
 
of t o patcbrn already set in the M stival-  Each Festival area should
 
be administra
,tiJelY responsible for its r
o
to
r special food
, service, leaving
 
to the overall administration only the responsibility for the mobile
 
vendors & K the large structure food services.
 
Staff concerns may be sumnarized as follows:
 
1
.  GS1 has Served us badly for too long.
 7
e should rid oarselves
 
of it.
 
2
.
 If we cannot, there are three: essentials to stress in negotiations:
 
a.  GSI has proven 04a
.pable of producing palatable full meals.
 
its menu should I
se confined to carnival Foods -- hamburgers,
 
hot dogs, pretzels, beer, lemonade and the like -
-- of top
 
quality and sold at a reasonable price.
 
b.  GSI should not be longer allowed to monopolize the sale of
 
beer, for some the sorest point of all.  Boer is an essential
 
part of some ethnic cuisines and forms an important point of
 
sslf-image for :A
merican workers.
 B
esides,  it s
often means
 
the difference between profit and break-even for local church
 
and community groups.
 
No must be allowed to contract with individual producers of
 
high-quality specialized '
food ite m (
e .g. .
Swensons ice cream
 
or fresh fruit juice bars) as well as with church and
 
community groups capable of preparing program-oriented regional
 
and ethnic foods.
 
Quality is the area of greatest staff concern.  Any food served
 
on the mail must reflect our high opinion of and our genuine
 
concern for our visitors.

 Finally;  we rust never be locked into a single r
-ood custributor
 
or a single type of c
oon service-
 "me entire Festival turns c
an
 
a st =nons to Americans to c
reme and celebrate the beauty of their
 
diversit7.
 Only in the area of food have we been letting them
 
down.

analysis, adding only t
hat after several hours of watching I could
 
tell when B

a r
elatively experienced a

ilm maker)
 
was behind t
he c
amera.  B
ishop's footage s
hows you what you want to see;
 
footage shot by t
he other  cameramen, t
hough t
echnically acceptable,
 
had an i
rritating t
endency t
o m
iss t
he heart of t
he action.
 
On t
he basis of t
he foregoing and my own experience w
ith f
olkloric
 
f
ilms, I have arrived at t
he f
ollowing recommendations.  They speak,
 
I believe, t
o most of t
he concerns expressed b
y t
he s
taff f
olklorists,
 
t
hough t
he p
lan d
iffers f
rom t
heirs.
 
a
.  That we go to f
ilm.  The advantages of f
ilm are:  archival
 
stability; availability of experienced and h
igh quality cameramen; a
 
built-in r
equirement of t
ight s
hooting; f
lexibility of equipment u
nder
 
varying conditions.
 
b
.  That we set up a t
ight s
hooting schedule each week of t
he
 
anticipated t
op performances (
including s
tory t
ellers, crafts people
 
and t
he l
ike a
s performers).  A working schedule c
ould be projected
 
i
n advance by Tom a
nd myself i
n consultation w
ith program coordinators,
 
checked on t
he f
irst performance day of t
he week by someone of A
lan's
 
t
ype (
an experienced f
olklorist, uninvolved w
ith other a
spects of t
he
 
festival), and shot on t
he f
ollowing two days.
 I
t should be budgeted
 
t
ime; t
hat i
s, we s
hould shoot only so much, perhaps an hour.
 
c
.  That we edit out each week a s
imple stringing t
ogether of a
 
half hour or even f
ifteen m
inute program of top performances on t
he mall
 
for t
hat week.  This should be s
imply i
ntroduced, perhaps by a f
olklorist/
 
host, followed by a performance t
aken a
ll t
he way t
hrough.  At t
he end
 
of each program, t
here s
hould be a
n announcement of what's coming next.
 
E
.g. "This i
s what i
s going on on t
he mall t
his week at your own
 
f
estival; f
irst, here's a f
ellow f
rom G
loucester, Massachusetts, showing
 
how you make f
ishnets," f
ollowed by a careful p
iece of footage t
hat
 
actually s
hows t
he entire process.  Then, "Now here are some people f
rom
 
Switzerland who have come to celebrate w
ith Swiss-Americans; t
hey're
 
p
laying on broomsticks a
nd g
lasses and one of t
hem i
s p
laying t
he t
une
 
on a l
eaf he p
icked off t
he tree."
 
d
.  That s
imultaneously, f
ootage t
angential but r
elated to t
he
 
selected performances be shot, a
lso on a budgeted basis:
 i
nterviews;
 
i
nteractions between performers a
nd audiences; special events; Marymount
 
footage; general v
iews of t
he areas (
e.g. t
he D
iaspora market); audience
 
r
eactions and t
he l
ike.  Such coverage would a
llow a
 series of r
etrospective
 
programs to be e
dited out during t
he f
all and w
inter, creating t
he k
ind
 
of series originally proposed by t
hefolkloric staff.  F
ocusing t
his
 
.WUWUN M.
 
tangential footage upon t
he major performances for t
he week i
s,
 
admittedly, a l
imiting factor; however, B
ishop's experience i
ndicates
 
c
learly t
hat we have to d
iscipline or focus ourselves i
n some way,
 
a
nd a properly r
epresentative selection of "performances" should i
nsure
 
our ability to produce not only coherent but w
ide-ranging r
etrospective
 
programs.
 
e
.  That we u
se a
s cameramen only experienced ethnographic or
 
documentary f
ilm men, not news cameramen  or special events cameramen.
 
I
f we are going to i
nvest a
ll t
his money, we s
imply must not g
ive way
 
on t
he primary i
ssue of getting t
he best possible material w

t
o work.
 
f
.  That masters of a
ll footage s
hot not be cut but be archived
 
i
n t
he Smithsonian's Anthropological  F
ilm Archives.  My primary objection
 
to v
ideotape i
s t
he sure k
nowledge t
hat most of t
he data w
ill be "wiped"
 
i
f not i
mmediately u
sable.
 
I believe t
he above r
eocmmendations t
o be coherent a
nd suitable to t
he
 
scholarly and r
esearch principles of t
he I
nstitution.  They speak to
 
t
he concerns of NEA w
ithout whose funding support t
he project i
s
 
unlikely to be r
ealized.  They g
ive u
s t
he best of both proposals we
 
have been considering.  Obviously, t
hey depend upon several factors:
 
f
irst, availability of a
ir t
ime; second, money.
 I
f, however, our
 
r
esponsibilities for archiving are t
aken seriously,  I do not believe
 
t
hat f
ilm w
ill be s
ignificantly more expensive.  V
ideotapers appear
 
generally to shoot a lot more t
han f
ilm cameramen because t
hey can w
ipe
 
what t
hey don't need.  We, on t
he other hand, need i

 I t

 Ethnic groups
 
This memo is being circulated for your information.
 It appears that
 
increased coordination during the field work and research period should
 
be advantageous to all programs.
 For example,  if field workers for
 
Regional or Working America turn up me: L
 crs of ethnic groups from the
 
first two lists below,  it would be extremely helpful for
 to know this.
 
List number three is especially important,  since it contains many groups
 
constituting significant blocks within the general population -- e.g.
 
Puerto Ricans, Chinese, Armenians, Lithuanians.
 These people are deeply
 
and legitimately concerned that their importance be recognized during
 
the 1976 celebration.
 If. field workers from any program locate potential.
 
participants from the third list,  it would very hel pful to know about it.
 
Please notify me, and I will get the ir
_formatior
_ to Fran% for  the master
 
wall chart a

estival F

t appears t
hat t

enough.
 Certain programmatic i

 Various suggestions, such as R

r
ecommendation of i

gnored.  Two whole
 
programs -- Family Folklore and t

entirely from t

One of t

ispanic-American
 
culture a
nd t
he cultural contributions of Spanish-speaking Americans.
 
The e

memoranda.
 I s
hould l
ike to emphasize t
hat a

he cooperating sections
 
of t

Native Americans, Regional Americans, O

t
he following points were made:
 
1
.  Other a

horoughly explored.  One
 
suggested was to expand R
egional during t
he week of July 4
,
 
r
educing t
he r
est of t

nd s
imilarly to
 
expand Working American during Labor D

C.
 The following agreements were r

3

I. Four D
ay Week
 
a
.  A
11 programs agree t
hat a four day week would be superior to a

The f

ather t

The most consistent and d

eceived has
 
been of t
he gap between r
hetoric and r

he marked d
isparity
 
between what we say we are doing and what we actually produce.  We
 
should t
herefore devote whatever r

tell you that I did receive yours and enjoyed it.

As far as Canada goes,  we are still in the  lengthy
 
process of governmental negotiations;  however,  the prospects
 
appear excellent.
 A telephone call a few weeks ago indicated
 
that some of the cultural affairs people from Ottawa will be
 
visiting us soon,  and final arrangements can then be set.
 
This rather elegant ritual dance must be completed before we
 
can get down to the  enjoyable part of field work and planning
 
what will actually work on the Mall.
 
Would it be possible for you to send me a vita with
 
particular reference to your field work?  Also,
 fi  you have
 
done anything in reference to Japanese Americans we should
 
be especially interested to hear about that,

Dear Bess,
 
I recently received a 'phone call from Andres Gutierrez,
 
of the E1 Centro Campesino Cultural -- distributors of
 
the film L03 VENDIDOS, which we used in our California
 
film -presentation.
 He asked me if I could furnish
 
any more endorsements of the film which could be used
 
in a publicity flyer he is preparing (I had already
 
sent him a quotable quote).
 So, this is the reason
 
for my letter.
 If  Tu do have the time in the next
 
week, a brief letter sent to Andres with such an
 
endorsement would, I know, be much appreciated.  I
 
personally think LOS V3NDIDOS is a film very much
 
worth promoting -- and it was my impression that .
you
 
felt similarly.  The letter shoi.ld be sent to:

 phone number:
 
E1 Centro Campesino Cultural

P.O. Box 1274

Also, if the film received any press coverage in Washington
 
during the Festival, I know that Andres would very much
 
like to know about it and receive clippings,  etc.
 
I hope you are well and enjoying your work.
 We are
 
still trying to re-adjust to life at home after a
 
splendid vacation.
 
Fpnd regards,

•  "BLUEGRASS CARDINALS" 
• 
The ultimate in Bluegrass/Country ! 
The incomparable
 
BLUEGRASS CARDINALS.
 
This sweet singing bluegrass band has been rated as the finest
 
in the country.
 They spent the summer of  '
75 entertaining people
 
from all over the world in the Showtime America presentation at
 
Busch Gardens in Van Nuys, California.
 Their fine humor and easy
 
rap accompanied by outstanding instrumental and vocal harmonizing
 
has brought them rave reviews in national publications.
 
The BLUEGRASS CARDINALS have appeared with Merle Travis,
 
Fmmylou Harris, The Dillards, and Linda Ronstadt.
 They have lent
 
their instrumental talents to such popular traveling groups as
 
Country Gazette, The Flying Burrito Brothers, Billy Strange and
 
Glenn Campbell as well as Mac Wiseman and Hylo Brown.
 Members have
 
been featured on five record albums and individually have done the
 
banjo background music for the Beverly Hillbillies TV series,
 
Disneyworld promotional advertisements , and a Seven-Up commercial.
 
This year they were chosen by the Smithsonean Institution to
 
represent b
luegrass from the state of California at the Festival of
 
American �
 ,
,,-
Klife in Washington, D.C.
 They have performed at most
 
of the well-known clubs in S. California, on many campuses, and at
 
most major bluegrass festivals..capturing all individual instrumental
 
classes, best instrumental group, and best vocal g:uup in the 1974
 
Arizona Bluegrass Festival held in Phoenix.
 
Randy Graham, mandolin master, was chosen the best bluegrass
 
vocalist in the state in 1974.
 Bill Bryson excells on stand-up
 
bass.
 As a former DJ he 'raps'  it all together.
 Don and David
 
Parmley  (
the father and son of the Cardinals) play the hottest
 
banjo and guitar ever to come out of Kentucky.

Dear Ms. Hawes:
 
It was indeed pleasant speaking with you today and
 
I hope we can work out some arrangement whereby Oak
 
Publications can show the public the ethnicmusico-
logical works it publishes.
 
I am sending a copy of each of the program books Oak
 
published for the Smithsonian and our complete cata-
logue as well.
 Please turn to the section marked
 
Oak in our catalogue, but for a fuller listing our
 
new catalogue will be forthcoming shortly and that
 
contains many new interesting publications.
 
I look forward to your comments and help.
 
Many thanks.

Dear S
irs:
 
I
 write on behalf of M
s. K
ate E
. R
inzler who has applied f
or
 
your program of graduate education.
 
I f
irst met M
s. R
inzler i
n California perhaps 1
2 or 1
5 years
 
ago; we h
ad many f
riends i
n common and we kept i
n c
asual touch
 
socially f
or some years.  At t
hat t
ime, s
he was a dancer, but a
lready
 
beginning to move i
nto t
he f
ield of education as a t
eacher of dance,
 
demonstrating i
n her personal behavior a
ll t
he qualities of self-
d
iscipline and perseverance t
hat such a career entails.
 
For t
he p
ast several years, she has been i
n Washington, D
.C.
 
where she t
aught i
n several  i
nner c
ity schools a
nd a
lso developed t
he
 
extraordinarily successful program f
or t
he C
hildrens Area for t
he
 
Festival of American Folklife.
 I have seen Ms. R
inzler's early
 
memoranda and s
tatements of principle on which t
he C
hildrens Area was
 
established; t
hey are h
ighly l
iterate, t
horoughly r
esearched,  i
nnovative,
 
and educationally sound.  They would be acceptable i
n any graduate
 
education program that I know of.
 
A
s Professor of Anthropology at California State University at
 
Northridge (
presently on a year's l
eave f
or work at t
he Smithsonian)
 
I have had occasion t
o work w
ith many graduate s
tudents r
eturning t
o
 
formal e
ducation after a period of years spent r
earing c
hildren or a
t
 
work.  They are often superior students, h
ighly motivated, setting
 
t
hemselves standards f
ar i
n advance of t
hose of t
he average graduate
 
student.
 I should myself p
lace Ms. R
inzler i
n t
his c
lass, a
nd I u
rge
 
your acceptance of her application.
 I do not t
hink t
here i
s a chance
 
you w
ill be d
isappointed.
 
P

Dear T
im:
 
Thanks f
or your p
leasant l
etter.
 I
 was myself very happy about
 
the California Chicano presentation, but i
t's good to hear that Don
 
Jesus l
iked i
t too.  As Don Jesus and Dan probably told you, t
here
 
was a
lso a presentation f
rom Mexico i
n another section of t
he Festival
 
which I hardly got to v
isit a
t a
ll, being so busy w
ith my end of
 
t
hings, but I heard good r
eports about i
t a
lso.
 
I enclose a program f
rom t
he 1
975 Festival  i
n which I have
 
noted the home town of t
he California Chicanos and Mexican Americans
 
for your i
nformation.
 I
f you need specific addresses, Barbara R
ahm
 
at CSUN can perhaps help you.  Phil Sonnichsen was i
n charge of t
he
 
program f
rom Mexico (
which i
ncluded some Mexican Americans and
 
Chicanos); perhaps you could get i
n touch w
ith h
im concerning how
 
to l
ocate "his folks" a
s I don't have t
hat i
nformation available.
 
I
'm a
lso enclosing a form f
or ordering t
apes from t
he F
estival; Dan
 
Sheehy, a
lso at C
SUN, or Barbara R
ahm m
ight be able to advise you on
 
what to ask for.
 
I
f you'd be i
nterested, I could send you l
ater on some
 
i
nformation on t
he whole week we p
lan to have next summer (
around the
 
second week of August) which w
ill be primarily devoted to H
ispanic
 
Americans.  Some of your s
tudents m
ight be i
nterested i
n coming --
I t
hink i
t w
ill be very exciting.

Dear Bess:
 
I heard detailed r
eports from Dan Sheehy and Jesus Sanchez about
 
the success of the Chicano and Mexican performances at the National
 
folk festival and I want to congratulate you.
 
I am particularly interested in knowing if the tapes of the
 
Chicano groups (
other than Jesus Sanchez) are in any way available.
 
I am particularly interested in the groups connected with the Farm
 
Workers.
 
Could I get a program with the names and place of origin of
 
each of the Chicano performing groups?  I would really appreciate
 
your help.

Dear B

I r

New Orleans, and was deeply moved by your paragraph on Ben Botkin.
 
I thought 1 should write and tell you so.
 I
t was l

t was

 F
inally t
he
 
apartment door c
losed for t
he l
ast t

and sat around a b
it f
or a post mortem a
nd then we noticed Ben,
 
who had gotten a b
it muzzy during t
he evening, s
itting quietly i
n
 
a corner, smiling t
hat l
ittle smile.  So we a
ll r
ushed around a
nd
 
made a f
uss over h
im and f
ixed h
im a bed for t
he n
ight and said
 
we would have a l
ong breakfast i
n t
he morning t
o catch up on o
ld
 
t
imes.  But i
n t
he morning he had a
lready gone, w
ith a neat l
ittle
 
note l
eft on h
is p
illow saying he thought he'd better get home.
 
He'd made up h
is bed, of course.
 
Well, he was a good friend.
 I am g
lad you appreciated h

 Program development status reports
 
Would each of you prepare for us no later than
 
Friday,  October 31  (All Hallows Eve),  a status report
 
up to and including that date providing a rundown
 
on fieldwork progress and program development so far
 
plus any info and/or questions you have about
 
directions,  deadlines,  and funding for future program
 
development.
 
These reports will provide necessary data for
 
the agendas of a series of meetings to be held between
 
Ralph,  usn's and each of you through next week  (the
 
time of which will be arranged individually).
 
Thank you.

Subject:
 the Italvision f
ilm
 
It turns out the answer print got damaged, and thus Italvision
 
will k
iKxx not be a
ble to send the film copies  (
2)  to us
 
before another 5 or 6 days.
 This presents us with two (
2)
 
problems:
 
a
.
 Paying for the f
ilm.
 It will cost $145 each if we buy
 
two, to a total of $
290.
 Can a purchase order or a something
 
be put through before we l
eave for New Orleans, so that this
 
will not be fouled up while we are gone?  Maybe just alert
 
Louise Neu?
 
b
.
 Disposing of the two copies.
 It would be great to have
 
our copy available for showing in New Orleans.
 Could Susan
 
perhaps either bring it with her or arrange to have it sent
 
after she leaves, if necessary?  The other should go in a
 
solemn diplomatic sort of way to the Museum of Rome a
s an
 
official gift of the Smithsonian.
 
Anna will have her own copy of the f
ilm with her and would
 
like to show it to Ralph and Alan Jabbour if possible while
 
she i
s here on Monday.
 If Susan would have time to set this
 
up  (
checking Ralph's schedule and then phoning Jabbour and
 
t
elling him) it would be great.

Dear Connie,
 
I thought you might be interested in seeing how
 
our plans for "Hispanic-A.-n
erican week" are developing.
 
The enclosed memorandum outlines the basic plan, but
 
even since I got it out two days ago,  there have been
 
new developments.
 
Dr. Arturo Warman of the Universidad Iberoamericano
 
will be meeting with Ralph Rinzler and me at the American
 
Folklore Society sessions in New Orleans next week.
 We
 
hope to persuade .
him to undertake the Mexican field
 
work and final presentation.
 Also, Ralph is just back
 
from Spain where he was unable to meet with Caro Baroja
 
who was in the Basque region at the time of Ralph's visit.
 
However, Anna Lomax will be meeting with Dr.  Baroja during
 
her visit to Spain this coming month.
 I am sure your
 
kind letter to aim has paved her way smoothly.
 Ralph
 
reports to our great triumph that we will not have to deal
 
with the SeccionTO i
nia but that Anna can go directly to
 
the field escorted by one of Dr.  Baroja's students.
 So
 
all seems to be going well there.
 
Again, our thanks for all your help and counsel.
 
Should you have any further suggestions by any chance in
 
regards to this program or any others, we'd of course be
 
grateful.
 Please feel free, if the mood hits you,  to call
 
me or Ralph collect at any time  (
202-381-6532).

This letter is to confirm officially ghat Rayna

presentation with your program in Spokane: for the

We very u
tuch regret the necessity for this
 
decision, but we have concluded that rather than engage
 
in further negotiations with your program we will
 
attempt to seek Gypsy participation from areas otier
 
t1 aii  t

We completely concur with your concern tlat
 
Gypsy culture be represented during the Bicentennial
 
celebration and wish to assure you t
ilat we will explore
 
every possible route to do so.
 We wish you success'

SUBJECT:
 Help at Marymount
 
My sister,  Shirley Mansell, now resident with
 
me, has been speaking with a friend, Mrs. Anne
 
Yarborough, wife of ex-Senator Yarborough's son.
 
Mrs.  Y.  is active in the Arlington Junior Action
 
Council  (
a sub-group of the Jr.  League) .  These young
 
women are well-organized and continually looking for
 
community service projects which they can do in
 
between taking children to school, etc.  -- in other
 
words, not full-time jobs.
 
Shirley remarked on the various difficulties at
 
Marymount last summer, especially problems of
 
transporting or helping participants with simple
 
problems,  like getting haircuts, going to the drug
 
store and the like.
 Anne thinks her organization
 
would be delighted to be of service in that kind of
 
area, pointing out they all live near Marymount and
 
could easily drop by to take participants shopping or
 
whatever.
 
Shirley,  herself, has had considerable experience
 
managing dormitories and would like to be of help.

Dear Paul,
 
Recent developments in my job here have caused
 
me to reconsider our conversation concerning my
 
participation on the Personnel Committee for the
 
department this year.
 The fact is, my time is
 
becoming increasingly not my own to schedule,  and
 
although I still anticipate a visit to the Los
 
Angeles area during March of next year, it is pretty
 
clear by now that I will not be able to control
 
exactly which week it will be.
 Ralph Rinzler,  the
 
Festival Director, has an increasingly heavy schedule
 
of diplomatic visits abroad, and a large part of my
 
job here is covering the home front for him during
 
his absence.
 I just don't think you can depend on
 
me for next spring.
 
I really hate to write tlis  letter, since I am
 
sure you have already proceeded with my nomination.
 
I shall. just hope I wasn't elected or that the PP&R
 
Committee turned the idea down.
 In any event,  I have
 
the  utmost faith in my colleagues,  as well as in
 
yourself,  and I know,  as I told you over the phone,
 
that you can form a strong co mmittee without me.
 
Please give everyone my affectionate greetings.
 
I will be seeing you sometime in the spring.
 Don't
 
work too hard.
 
Yours,

week
 
It occurs to to you may not l

on the uispanic-i

 week scdedule, now set for
 
August 11-14.
 Old Ways is .
bringing in Spain and
 
14exieo then;  Diaspora will have aigeria  (aausa add
 
Yoruba)  and Panama or Puerto Pico matcaed by Puerto
 
Ricaas and Cujans from  ew York,  Regional is doing
 
the SouCnwe3t and NA is bringing in the Pueblo Indians
 
from the name area.
 Lots of bpanislh-speaking on t
are
 
Nall that week.
 
It Seems to ma it might i
>e interesting if you
 
asked your field workers to keep an especial eye out
 
for workers of Spanish, Moxican, Puerto Rican, C yan,
 
etc. background during that weak.
 At first l regretted
 
that we hadn't seaedulad it during tie 'workers who
 
feed us" week, but that's becoming a stereotype.
 How
 
about getting a bi-lingual Chicano teacher from t
ine
 
California AFT for inatance?  They have mounted a big
 
program r
taere and .
have some fascinating materials and
 
researdh stuff dealing with "Spar
aglish' and Vie lime.
 
And Z should t
;iink there would be Chicano or Puerto--
rique-nos in true-king or railroading maybe?

Dear Ms.  Forster,
 
I am sorry to have taken so long to respond to
 
your nice letter, which was passed along to me during
 
Ralph Rinzler's absence in Europe.
 I circulated the
 
information on the Washington International School
 
to our various program coordinators , and I understand
 
that Mrs . Melnicove i
ias already spoken to you by phone
 
with a view to recruiting not only volunteers but some
 
possible participants from your student body.
 
Our volunteer coordinator Aas not yet come on
 
staff, and I hesitate to interfere with the workings
 
of the school by sending visitors from our staff one
 
at a time .  Would it be agreeable if we postponed a
 
visit until I can assemble the various interested
 
program and volunteer coordinators so that we can visit
 
the school early next spring in a group?
 
In the meantime, thank you so much for your
 
thoughtfulness in sending the information on your
 
school.
 I look forward to m
e=eting you again and to
 
seeing the extraordinarily interesting work you are
 
doing.

Alan says Jim says he doesn't care about tee shirts, medallions
 
or phonograph records one way or the other and the issue is now
 
over to somebody-else.  Since the papers have now returned to my
 
desk, I guess it's me; on the other hand, I have had some degree
 
of training in side-stepping and it appears to me the prime issue
 
is fiscal.
 
My recommendations are as follows:
 
1)  It seemed to me last summer that tee shirts were a critical
 
psychic issue, in view of the number that were swiped, and the
 
number of participants who asked me where they could be bought.
 
My own view is that medallions, being less conspicuous, will not
 
fill the bill, especially if the staff continues to wear tee shirts.
 
Many participants will not have record players; besides ikxXxx
rxx records are
 
a bulky item to transport back home to Manipur.
 
2
)Therefore: could we adopt either plan A or M.
 
A.  Scrap the medallions or make them available at cost
 
Buy every participant and staff member a tee shirt, give them
 
out to the program coordinators and make them responsible for getting
 
them where they should go.
 
Make the Smithsonian album available at cost to all participants
 
and staff (
purchases to be made at the record store on the mall).
 
B.  As above, except to make the tee shirts also available for purchase
 
at cost to participants only.
 
If a decision could be made on the above issue now, it could be put
 
in the budget and got out of the way.  Personally, I strongly recommend
 
A.  I understand the unit cost is small compared tkt the amount of
 
good will engendered.

Mr. Ralph Rinzler, Director of the Festival of American
 
Folklife, has been nominated to make application for a Guggenheim
 
Foundation grant by f
ir. Julian Euell, Assistant Secretary for
 
Public Service, Smithsonian Institution.
 The application form
 
was delivered to Mr. Rinzler's office on October 1st and carried
 
a deadline date of October 8th.
 
Mr. Rinzler has been in Europe on a business trip for the
 
Smithsonian since September 7th and will not be back in the country
 
until November 1st.
 I spoke to Mr. Rinzler upon receipt of the forms
 
and informed him of the nomination.
 He was very grateful for the
 
honor but felt that the time problems surrounding the deadline, his
 
current absence from the country, and his consequent inability to
 
present a thoroughly considered proposal, prevent him from applying
 
for a grant at this time.
 
He asked that I express his deep regret at not being able to do
 
so and his hope that he may have the opportunity to make application
 
in the future.
 
Sincerely yours,
 
Bess Lomax Hawes,
 
Deputy Director

SUMMARY OF 1976 PROGRAM BOOK: CONTENT SUGGESTIO14S
 
The following recommendations were arrived at in
 
consultation between Bob B.,  Rayna, Charley,  Bill,  Susan K.,
 
Peter,  Tom K.,  Bernice and Bess.
 Not all are supported
 
with equal enthusiasm by each of the above;  the thought ,
was,
 
however,  to get a beginning down on paper for later
 
refinement.
 
1
.
 Overall format. The decision to publish one program
 
book to be sold throughout the twelve weeks was strongly
 
supported;  this should be of the highest quality in
 
terms of content and illustrations,  in hopes that it will
 
be purchased and retained as a Bicentennial souvenir.
 The
 
program book would contain an insert which would be
 
published weekly or bi-weekly;  the insert should be
 
available for sale separately at a slight cost to
 
people who want only a simple schedule of events.
 
The suggestion follows that the program book return -to
 
the original 9 x 12 format so as to encourage the
 
retention of the book in the family bookshelv-
-s.
 The
 
insert, however,  could still be printed longways,  if
 
schedule lay-out is better served.
 
2.
 Insert content. The insert should contain the following
 
items at a minimum:
 (
the first two should remain the
 
same throughout the Festival;  the last two change.
 
a map of the Festival grounds
 
a general informational section  (
as in .
1975 program
 
book)
 
li sts of the participants'  names
 
an abbreviated schedule of events in all sections
 
The names of sponsors and contributors might be divided
 
as follows -- sponsors and major contributors in  the
 
program book;  donors whose contributions will be visi ble
 
on the Mall for only one or two weeks in the ins ert.
 
3
.
 Program book content. 
Sever al basic ideas as to content
 
emerged in our discussions.
 They are summarized for
 
the sake of convenience in terms of se ctions,  though
 
it is not necessary that this division be maintained in
 
the final book copy.
 
l
 
A.
 An overall "ceremonial" section which should
 
contain the following:
 
A statement by Secretary Ripley.
 We feel
 
that the Secretary should be invited to
 
contribute an especial'evaluative comment for
 
this Bicentennial book.
 
A statement from the National Park Service
 
Director.
 
2 n r
)
1 v i  r
'
1e
 
An article of some length by Ralph R
.inzler
 
reviewing the history of the Festival.
 
B.
 A program-related section in which each of the
 
seven Festival divisions is represented by a
 
brief statement of the purpose and perspective
 
of the particular program.
 Each of these
 
should be limited to a half-page  (
one page at
 
most)  including an appropriate ph oto.
 
C.
 A section of general cross-programmatic arl.icles
 
addressing major issues,  interestingly written and
 
illustrated by photographs and other
_ suitable
 
graphics.
 The following suggestions were
 
made;(not all need be use 0.

overall topic of celebration and festival

An article by Alan Lomax, condensed from one
 
published by UNESCO magazine�on the topic of
 
cultural feedback -- how the  Festival can
 
reamin alive in the home commu►iities a f
ter
 
the events on the Mall are finished.
 
-3-
 
•
 
A cross-programmatic picture story on a
 
single type of behavior:
 bread making was
 
suggested.
 
D.
 A section of short articles,  including picture
 
stories,  interviews with performers,  and the
 
like generated out of the various sections of
 
the Festival.
 Each program would  (
according
 
to our somewhat rudimentary figuring)  have
 
about seven pages,  allowing for two or three
 
articles on different topics relevant to
 
their presentation.
 Regional suggested they
 
would like to have an article on the various
 
ways people have of defining or explaining their
 
"home turf" -- their region,  town,  or homesite.
 
This would be prepared from interviews with
 
participants.
 Secondly,  they would like to
 
include an article on some aspect of regional
 
food and cookery practices.
 Old Ways wants to
 
have one article which would consist of the
 
life history of a participant,  addressing
 
particularly the immigrant experience.
 Secondly,
 
they want to include an article on the ethnic
 
community, how it works, how people move in and
 
out of it at varying times in their lives, what
 
its supportive functions are.
 Native Americans
 
suggests the possibility of repri nting one or
 
two of the fine articles written by a variety
 
of Indianist scholars which were printed in
 
the American Airlines magazine a year ago.
 The
 
article on Native American religion by Al Ortiz
 
and the article on Native American law by Vine
 
Deloria were mentioned as possible selections.
 
Other programs would provide similarly varied
 
sections.
 
It was agreed that Bess and Bob would discuss
 
this overall scheme with Susanne and Janet,  and
 
check it with Ralph upon his return.
 Bess will
 
then go back to the various programs for
 
further specific ideas  for articles;  formal
 
negotiations with prospective authors  will be
 
conducted by Bess.
 
Overall,  the feeling seemed to be that the program
 
book should be generated by the Festival but should reach
 
beyond it.
 We want people to keep it and use it after

should call on the resources of our admirable picL-ure file
 
as well as on the bibliographic recommendations of our
.
 
authors.
 We have a chance here to make a lasting contribution
 
which wi ll keep the principles of our Festival alive long
 
after we' ve all gone home.

Dear Annie,
 
I write in haste to apologize for t
_ie interminable
 
delay in sending t
ine enclosed tape.
 I had thoug h it
 
had gone out long ago when I found it on my desk today.
 
I really don't know what happened, but I am sorry for
 
the mix-up and hope that the magnificence of your
 
sound will make up for our inefficiency.
 
I am sending along a reel-to-reel recording, since
 
it's quality is better than any cassette version could
 
be.
 F
:owever,  if you prefer a cassette,  let me know and
 
I will have the 1
,1
arymount session dumbed for you in
 
that form.  On a few of the selections,  tie microphone
 
placement was such that certain voices stand out a bit
 
strongly;  I
' m afraid jack won't like that too much, but
 
it was an electronic accident rather than a lack of
 
community blend in the actual singing.
 I do :
lope y
_ou
 
lice them.
 
Finally,  I was in Boston last weekend to look at
 
t
sie videotape that was taken of the California presentation.
 
As you remember, one of your concerts was filmed in full,
 
and Joan Bishop, my i
-on-in-law, asked me to tell you that
 
he will edit t
:ais into form to be sent you within the next
 
couple of months, t
iie whole matter having been :
f
ield up
 
pending the arrival of some necessary video equipment in
 
the University of Massachusetts lab.
 The bit I saw looked
 
fine,  and I hasten to tell you that the editing will
 
simply consist of taking out the  occasional bits of
 
bustle that inevitably occur between selections when the
 
audience is reseating itself and so fortiz.
 6
a
rien the final
 
editing time comes closer, Join will no doubt write you
 
to find out if you want tie videotape in the form of a
 
cassette or reel to reel or just 4hat.

Dear Mrs. Luttman ,
 
Thank you for sending me your interesting proposal.
 
I have taken the liberty of forwarding it along to the
 
Smithsonian's National Anthropoligcal Film Center;  their
 
archive has not been in existence very I
c
ing, but they
 
may have some information that would be of help to you
 
concerning prior work that may have been done on this
 
topic.
 
As for funding, it would seem to me that this
 
project is one of those which might be of interest to
 
either the National Endowment for the Humanities or the
 
National Endowment for the Arts.
 I do not know which
 
agency concerns itself more generously with the kind of
 
visual recording you propose.
 Perhaps the NAFC people
 
will speak to that point.
 
I would suggest that your apparent lack of
 
experience in filming or video-taping is a serious
 
difficulty in seeking funding.
 Perhaps by -the time you
 
send in your final application you will be able to add
 
information suggesting your qualifications in the
 
necessary techniques.
 (
I speak here from personal
 
experience, having served on some of the NEA committees.
 
I do wish you the best of luck with your project,
 
and please give Hector Lee my kindest regards when you
 
see him next.

Dear  Ms.  Hawes:

CAL
IFORNIA STATE COLLECE,SONOMA
 
LUX MENTIS-LUX ORBIS
 
My  husband  and  I were  speaking with Hector  Lee  recently  about  our plan  to
 
spend  next  summer  studying  and videotaping  the  dances  of  the  Arctic Alaskan
 
Eskimos.
 Dr.  Lee  suggested we  contact you  for  suggestions  about  our project.
 
I am  enclosing  a copy  of  our preliminary proposal  so  that you may  acquaint
 
yourself with  our plan.
 
We  are  having  difficulty  finding  literature  on  the  subject.
 I suspect  that
 
this  is  because  there  just  isn't much.
 But nonetheless,  I feel  compelled  to
 
search out whatever meager  studies  might  have  been made.
 Can you  suggest
 
possible  sources  of  bibliographies  on  the  subject?
 Also,  can you  suggest  any
 
possible  sources  of  funding  for  such  a project?
 
Due  to  the  accelerated  rate  of  acculturation  of  the Alaskan  natives,  it  is  of
 
increasing  concern  that  their  folkways  be preserved.
 The  art  of pantomime-
dance  is  still  retained  by  a small  group  of  aging  Eskimos,  but  in  another  few
 
years  it may  cease  to  exist  entirely.
 Therefore,  not only  is  this  project
 
of  extreme  importance,  but  it  is  essential  that  it  be  done  soon.
 
Since we  are planning  to  begin  our  study  at  the  end  of  the  current  academic
 
year,  we  are  required  to  submit  our proposal  for  funds  in  the  immediate
 
future.
 Therefore,  your  rapid  reply will be  greatly  appreciated.
 
Thank you very much  for whatever  assistance  you  can  offer.
 
Sincerely,

 I have sent it along to the editor of

 By the way, it turned out that

FROM:

SUBJECT:
 Main stage house band
 
B.C.  at a recent meeting raised the need for a house
 
band, singing group or the like, to be assigned to the
 
main stage throug l
out the Festival to cover blank periods
 
in t
ide mai:i stage schedule,  fill in for missing performers
 
and the like.
 Such a group would be scheduled formallVt_
.Onae
 
or twice a day and would not be available for other
 
Festival appearances, so as to be continually "on call"
 
for the main stage.
 Any group selected sAould be reason-
ably versatile witiz exteasive repertoire and enough aplomb
 
to go into action quickly when needed.
 
I have discussed this notion since with several people,
 
and two suggestions i
iave emerged:
 
1
.
 To turn the responsibility for selecting and booking
 
such a "house band" over to Regional.
 This would
 
give us a different performing group each week on
 
the main stage selected from the region being featured,
 
and so providing some variation in style.
 Consultation
 
with ;
regional reveals they would be happy to take on
 
the responsibility providing that budgetary help
 
would be forthcoming from somewhere.
 
2.
 To select,each week, a different group from Washing-
ton, D.C.  alone.
 This could be  c
andled jointly
 
between ADAG and Regional choosing from local blue
 
grass groups, gospel quartets, etc.) .  This scrien-t
e
 
has certain fiscal attractions, most particularly
 
that local groups would not have to be put up at
 
x
Aarymount and would not cost us in travel money.
 
Thus, each group selected could be paid a flat fee
 
of perhaps $500.00 a week.
 Such a fee, admittedly
 
low, might be attractive to local groups because of
 
the visibility afforded ,y a week-long stint on the
 
Hall , and considering that their evenings would
 
still be free for other 000kings.
 
-2-
I pe r
sonally tend to favor the second alternative,
 
in part because of the advantages cited ajove, and in
 
part because it would demonstrate that we are paying
 
some specific attention to D.C. itself during the
 
Bicentennial year.
 
Fiscally speaking, monies for either }
flan, it seems,
 
should come from the administrative budget since no
 
specific area of the Festival would benefit outside
 
of the main stage.
 Are t
aiere any funds left in that
 
budget?

Dear Mr. Rinzler:
 
Unfortunately I did not receive a copy of your letter of
 
August 13 until September 4.  I am very grateful fot your invitation
 
to colaborate in the presentation of hispanic folk tradition in
 
1976,  as I fully agree with the objectives of your effort. However,
 
I am afraid,  I shalL not be able to colaborate on a full time basis
 
because of my com
ilitments in academic and research work.  But I am
 
willing and able to cooperate with you and I shall
-
-be glad to meet
 
you in Mexico to comment and to plan the program if I can be help-
fuly.
 
As a previous opinion,  I believe that Irene Vasquez o
,- The
 
National '
Museum of Anthropology,  is the best option for doing the
 
research,  field work and coordination of the presentation at the
 
Festival.  She has the best academic and proffesional qualifications.
 
Aditionally,  as a member of the corresponding mexican institution,
 
she willbe able to facilitate the official ties needed for your
 
project.  In another sense,  I think that we will be able to work
 
together in some aspects of the project.  If you think that to
 
establish a previous contact with her will be helpfully I shal be
 
glad to do it.
 
Regreting that I am not able to accept your invitation
 
Truly yours
 
an
 
Sorry for my English and my typewritting.

 Bess Lomax hawes
 
Deputy Director for Presentation
 
Festival of American Folklife
 
In the presentation of folkways from the California
 
central agricultural region during the 1975 Festival of
 
American Folklife, one of the participants was an elderly
 
gentleman from the Greek Island of Andros who demonstrated
 
the making of the traditional straw beehives common to
 
Mediterranean farmers.
 
Upon Mr. Kodros'  return to California, his son Craig,
 
a biology student at the University of California in
 
Berkeley, researched his father's craft and recently sent
 
us the attached brief paper for forwarding to the  Smithsonian. 
The paper strikes me as a bit amateurish for publication;
 
however, it did seem perhaps that the enclosed photographs
 
(
some taken by Craig Kodros and some by the Festival
 
photographer) might be of some interest, and that the
 
topic might be sufficiently intriguing to be worth further
 
investigation by your staff.
 
At any rate, we should appreciate your consideration
 
of Mr. Kodros'  article.

 Documentation of the Italian and Italian-American meeting
 
at Marymount, summer, 1975
 
Attached is Anna Lomax's translation of the session held at
 
Maxymount by the Italian and Italian-American performers to discuss
 
both the present and the future state of Italian traditional music.
 
Anna has written it out in the form of a dramatic script, and in
 
places one can almost hear it b
eing "played".
 
I hope you can find time to go through it.  There is repetition
 
and some dullness and a number of flights away from the subject; but
 
in places it is an absolutely extraordinary record of the poetic
 
springs from which our Festival derives its strength.
 
If we can repeat this experiment with every national group
 
that comes next summer,  I think we can produce a book of which the
 
whole Smithsonian would be very proud.

SUBJECT
 : Documentation and Archiving Policy
 
The Deputy Director for Presentation, Bess Hawes, is responsible for
 
formulating and supervising policies relating to FAF documentation and
 
archival preservation. Under her direct supervision, the Archivist, Frank
 
Proschan, is responsible for implementing and activating those policies.
 
The field research documentation procedures have already been determined
 
by the programs; the Festival documentation policies are currently under
 
consideration. Following is a statement of policy regarding the Archival
 
functions:
 
PURPOSE
 
The Archive will provide a central listening, storage, security, and
 
duplicating facility for Festival documentation and field research materials.
 
The tapes and documentation in the Archive will be catalogued so as to
 
allow for their efficient and convenient use by FAF staff and qualified
 
researchers.
 
SCOPE
 
The Archive will receive and Archive all FAF recordings and photo-
graphs, as well as copies of all field reports and interview report cards.
 
The Archive will provide access to this material to DPA staff for Festival
 
planning and research, and ultimately to outside scholars, and provide
 
duplication services for DPA staff and other authorized persons.
 
PROCEDURE FOR FIELD DATA
 
As field data is received, program coordinators or field research
 
coordinators should first determine that the field research contract is
 
fulfilled by the material submitted. Then, all tapes and photographs
 
should be turned over to the Archive, along with copies of all field
 
reports and interview report cards. The material will be assigned num-
bers, catalogued, and stored in the Archive, where it will be available
 
for use in Festival planning.
 
DUPLICATION PROCEDURE
 
Duplication of FAF recordings and photographs will be allowed only
 
to the following persons:
 
a
.
 Those to whom we have a contractual obligation to provide copies.
 
b.  Participants, of their FAF performances and field interviews.
 
c
.
 Field-workers, of their field work and performances in their areas
 
at the Festival.
 
d
.
 Educational, scientific, or cultural organizations or institutions,
 
subject to approval by Ralph or Bess.
 
In all cases, requester must sign an assignment agreement promising not to
 
make commercial use of the tapes. Also, in all categories except (
a),
 
requester must reimburse the DPA for the cost of the tape, and for cases
 
(
c) and (
d), requester must also pay an hourly fee of $ 15 for the
 
copyist's time. This service fee can be waived at the discretion of
 
Ralph or Bess. All requests for duplication services should be directed
 
to Frank, and no obligations that are inconsistent with these procedures
 
should be made by anyone.

 ADAG
 
September 9,  1975
 
The anomalous position of ADAG vis a vis OWriW is
 
beginning to create embarrassment and difficulties.
 We
 
suggest that you make official :
.
ry memo the situation that
 
exists in fact  (
even on Dick's new organizational chart)
 
and confirm the administrative independence: of ADAG.
 At
 
the same time,  there is a clear need for continual
 
coordination between ADAG, OWNW and Ethnic Tours.
 Perhaps
 
some such wei-L
i
oranduzn as the following would be appropriate:
 
TO:
 Supervisory Committee and all Program Coordinators
 
FROM:
 Janes Horris
 
During the recent period of firming up the organizational
 
and staffing plans for t
:ie 1976  r
estival,  the relationship
 
between ADAG and OWAW has been re-examined.
 It seems both
 
efficient and appropriate to recognize that the problems
 
and policies of these two units are not identical, and thus
 
that their administrative procedures differ also.
 I SI,
 
therefore, severing these two units, making ADAG responsible
 
to the Supervisory Committee,  tae two deputy directors and/or
 
to the restivil Director depending on Cie nature of the
 
pro' lem involved.
 (
See t
ree organizational chart being
 
circulated by Dick Lusher.)
 
H
cniever,  in view of the need for close coordination
 
between Old `
mays, Diaspora and ethnic Tours, t
iie Program
 
Coordinator or designated pippresentative for the latter two
 
units should attend Old Ways staff meetings.
 Diaspora and
 
Ethnic Tours may also invite an Old Ways representative; to
 
their meetings, but time might well be conserved by the first
 
procedure alone.

Subject:  Sea chanteys
 
A. L
omax says that during the sumrr
_er of 1976 there is going to be a
 
sail-in into '
N
ew York harbor participated in by all the clipper ships
 
in the world (
several hundred, apparently).  He suggests that all
 
field workers should know about -t
his in case they come across ar
.
,y
 
smell of an old chantey tradition; (
the people organizing this event
 
are looking out too, and we might be able to use some of their people).
 
He particularly suggests that Tom Vennum keep an eta out for the chantey
 
tradition in Germany, where it used to be e
specially strong and where
 
they had their own special repertoire.  There i
s quite likely to be
 
a sea
_ chantey society in Germany where he might be put on to some of
 
the old singers.
 
There might possibly be some c
oordination here, especially finar

If it comes off, anyway, it ought to be t

Alan Lomax suggests that, since the instrumentalists u
sed in the films
 
by the Seccion Feminina are quite fine traditional players, we might
 
approach the Spanish government about s
ending over a national company
 
of musicians, with no dancers.  (He points out that most musicians can
 
dance anyway, so t
i
led be getting some d
ance performance built in.)
 
In representations to the Spanish goverii
mrent, it might be pointed out
 
that the musical tradition transferred to the new world in a more
 
lasting t
ray than did the d
ance tradition.  Perhaps with this approach
 
the Seccion Ferinina might even cooperate.
 
He also recommends that the ballad tradition of Astuu:ias be looked into
 
by the field worker.  Here i
s another p
art of the world (
besides the
 
1
'aroes) where the ballads are danced -- a very ancient style.  He s
nys
 
also that the Astarian ballads are typic=
illy sung in responsorial form,
 
the lead singer singing a line and then wole chorus-audience repeating
 
it.  This should be good for our audiences, who always like to get in
 
on some of the act.

From:  Bess
 
Subject:  Etiznic groups
 
This memo is being circulated for your information.
 It appears that
 
increased coordination during the field work and research period should
 
be advantageous to all programs.  For example, if field workers for
 
Regional or Working America turn up members of ethnic groups from the
 
first two lists below, it would be extremely helpful for OWNW to know this.
 
List number three is especially important, since it contains many groups
 
constituting significant blocks within the general population -- e.g.
 
Puerto Ricans, Chinese, Armenians, Lithuanians.  These people are deeply
 
and legitimately concerned that their importance be recognized during
 
the 1976 celebration.
 If field workers from any program locate potential
 
participants from the third list, it would very helpful to know about it.
 
Please notify me, and I will get the information to Frank for the master
 
wall chart and to all other programs that might be concerned.
