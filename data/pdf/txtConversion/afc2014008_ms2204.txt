Dear Mrs. Haves:
 
In preparing for the production of STEP IT DOWN, Mr.
 
Prettyman and I discussed the book's jacket.  We thought
 
it would be a nice presentation to have a photograph of
 
you on the cover--the flap or back cover--.
 
If you agree could you send us several photographs':
 
Thank you.

Dear Mrs. Haves:
 
I owe you more than an apology for not having kept you
 
up-to-date with our progress on STEP IT DOWN.  The manu-
script has gone into production and we shall be getting
 
a schedule out to you in a couple of weeks.
 
I have suggested a minor change in the order of material,
 
that is the placement of the Notes to Scholars and Teachers
 
at the back of the book.  They are no less useful there, but
 
they are less obtrusive to the general reader.
 
I do' üot think any problems will arise from the use of
 
"Negro" at places in the text.  There is such a lack of
 
objective criteria for the use of "Black, Negro, and Afro-
American." that I think they can we l
l be used interchange-
ably -
 according to one's ear -
 as long as no one of them
 
is left out completely.
 
I also feel that the inclusion of "Coonshine" and "Daniel"
 
is a good idea.  Each in its way indicates a different ex-
pressive range no less spontaneous or genuine than the other
 
games and plays.  It's good to indicate that these too are
 
part of the heritage.
 
Mr. Brackman apparently forgot to check the copyright status
 
of these two additional songs, but I expect to hear from
 
him on this shortly.
 
a 
iince I sha l
l be in the ian FrancIsco area next week,
 
from Monday, September 1 to Wednesday, September 3
, at the
 
meetings of the American Sociological Association, I shall
 
try to reach you by phone to say hello and talk over any
 
other points we may need to consider prior to publication.
 
With very best wishes,

Thank you for your nice letter, which I haven't answered before
 
because it arrived while I was away on a long-delayed vacation;
 
then when I got home I had to face not only a large stack of mail
 
but the start of the fall quarter and my career as a graduate
 
student.
 I am sorry we didn't get together during the sociological
 
meetings in San Franciscot it would have been a great pleasure to
 
meet,

Your secretary,  I believe, has written me once or twice aski
 
about photographs for the book jacket.
 I will send one a1on
 
of myself within the week; I hope it will do for reproductio
 
I have no suitable picture of Beasts Jones but I can suggest
 
least two sources from which you might be able to obtain goo
 
pictures.
 The first is a young photographer named Bob Yolli.
 
who took the photographs for Guy Carawan's book Ain't You Go!-
Right to the Wree of Life. Have you seen that book by the w

I think it's a gorgeous piece of work.
 The other photograph
 
q
ho might have good pictures of Bessie is a young lady named

 J
 •  Davies who, I understand, has photographed Bessie extens iv.
 
As a matter of fact, I believe either Bob Yellin or Miss Davies
 
f
l
ight already have suitable photos ready at hand and both are I

 Unfortunately, I don't have an address for either on

Dear Krs. Hawes:
 
I wrote you about a month ago recuesting a picture of Mrs.
 
Jones but I haven't heard from you. Perhaps you misplaced
 
the letter or was just tied up with moving,etc.
 
The manuscript is in production and soon we will be workiric
 
on the jacket, jacket,copy etc. and we would like to have a
 
picture of Mrs. Jones as soon as possible. It could also be
 
cseo P
or publicity purposes.

Dear Mr. Prettymans
 
I have finally located a photograph which might do for your
 
book-jacket purposes and which I enclose.  Please let me know if
 
it is both suitable and reproducable.  The photographer has
 
offered to make another print to specifications shoat
hd the
 
quality be unsatisfactory.
 By the way, since this young gen-
tleman is  just starting out as a free-lancer and since photo-
graphs cost money, who pays him - -  me or you?
 
Concerning Bessie Jones, I have also located two pictures of
 
her through the kind offices of the Berkeley Folk Festival;
 
however, they only wish to lend the pictures and neither of
 
them seems to me quite right anyway.  Have you had any luck
 
with the two suggestions I made in an earlier letter?  If not,
 
let me know and I will send these; I do hope we could do better,
 
though.  One was taken in full sunlight and she is squinting a
 
bit; the other, though a beautiful picture, was taken over ten
 
years ago and doesn't really look like her now.
 
Now I wonder if you could help me with another problem?  Somehow
 
I have lost the bibliography and annotations sections which should
 
be with my carbon of the manuscript.
 I have written Josephine
 
Rogers asking if she has them but she has not replied, so I
 
assume she doesn't.
 Would be at all possible for you to xerox
 
just those few pages and send them to me?  I need them for ref-
erence quite frequently; I
'd also like to check them over for
 
the fortieth time before we get into the galley stage.
 
And speaking of galleys, how long can I go on making corrections
 
and additions?  There are two bobs, for example, which I shost
hd
 
very much like to include somewhere: a new dictionary of jump
 
rope rhymes and'an old classic which I have only just now been
 
able to locate at the University of California library: Dr.
 
Lorenzo Turner's Africantsms in the Gullah Dialect. There is a
 
book which should never have been allowed to go out of print, by
 
the way, and if I were a publisher. I would bring it out again
 
as a public service along with Zora Neale Hurston's Mules an  Men,
 
both of them elegant books and both of them quite unobtainable
 
except in the odd library.  Just a suggestion...
 
I hope things arØ going smoothly.  Do let me have a copy of the
 
btblio raphy at '
,Least
; if you possibly can.
 I won't add anything
 
without your okay, bjt  I certainly could use it.
 
Cordially.

from Toni Rachiele
 
re Ster, It Down
 
The music editor had a lot of questions for the author that
 
have to be answered before we go any further with the music.
 
Could you send her the attached material, Xeroxes of the
 
edited music, and ask her to look them over.  Secia1  ttention
 
should be given to the items on the memo from the must
 
editor,
 
but she should also look at the rest of th e songs
 to make sure
 
the music has been correctly interpreted.
 
The t
le
 pages are due in Friday or Xonday, and as soon as
 
we apprbve them the manuscript can go out to the compositor.
 
That means the art work should move along pretty fast from now
 
on, so it doesn't hold the galleys up.
 
Thanks very much.

Dear Miss Runtleyi
 
Thank you so much for the copy of the bibliography for
 
Step It Down. Can I trouble you for another favor?
 
When I originally wrote Mr , Prettyman about a xerox of the
 
bibliography, I also asked to have the Annotations section
 
copied for me as well, since I had been working on the two
 
together and managed to lose both at the same time.
 (
I think
 
they are simply misfiled and probably safely packed away in
 
my old office at San Fernando Valley State College, but they
 
might as well be on the moon as far as accessibility to me
 
are concerned.)  Anyway, I guess the message wasn't clear.
 
Could you possibly have that second section (
headed Annotations)
 
xeroxed for me as well?  I am sorry to be such a nuisance.

Dear Mrs Pr.ttytaans
 
Enclosed are the musical transcriptions for  
p I
t LWn together with
 
a separate list of the songs end my 0ot
0nts an each.  Since there are
 
now so many copies and rewrites floating around, I have also stapled
 
a note to each transcription which seemed to me to ratse any problem.
 
There are quits a number of overall points $
 
1)  I agree to the editor's recommendation that the indication of the
 
key in which the song was ortgtnal y sung should be dropped from this
 
bock.  It is o however, a standard recommendation of the International
 
Folk Music Council, a copy of whose official practices for the trans -
cription of folk music I will be happy to sand you for your music
 
departmental reference library.
 
2)  1 also agree to the elimination of the parentheses I had placed
 
around notes in the key signature which do not appear in the melody
 
line.  This is again a recommended standard p
ractice, since it indicates
 
to musicologists that the tunes in question are modal, as are a large
 
propootton of American folk melodies.  }
Iovever, I agree that it i
s
 
confusing in a book of this kind.
 
3)  Putting the metronome mark on the left side of the copy appears
 
to be a standard practice; my error.
 
4)  The line above the staff for the clapping patterns to fine with
 
me and looks much nicer than the way I had it.
 
5)  The editor seems to prefer accent marks to be placed under the
 
note in question rather than above it.  I really don't care where they
 
go, but it might be helpful to note that I just looked at three standard
 
books of lolk.ong transcription taken from my shelves at random, and
 
they all have the accent marks over the notes in order, I suspect, to
 
avoid their getting in the way of the words a
lso printed under the
 
music •
 which was why I put them on top to begin with.  I should think
 
this point could best be settled between the music editor and the printers
 
6)  About those grace notes (almost all
, of which were revised by the
 
editor, not just those in (rooq Sally  D). 
They represent my attempt
 
to demonstrate, in a way which would leave the skçletal fra m
ework of
 
the tune cle a
r, some small part of the subtle quality of Mrs. Jones'
 
melodic phrasing and "decoration" of the notes.  I could have put in
 
thousands; the ones I left in were carefully selected to the best of
 
my ability, after literally hundreds of listening& to the tapes, as
 
important to the partieular quality and interest of the tunes •
 An
 
eighth note followed or preceded by a grace note should not be taken
 
as a complicated way of writing two sixteenth ; the grace note i
s
 
2.
 
intended to indicate the quality of attack or release given a particu-
lar note.
 I an willing to have the problem handled in one of three
 
ways s
 
a) left as I wrote then
 
b)  the line to the grace may be drawn straight rather
 
than in a curve like a slur lines in some transcription systems
 
(particularly in jazz) this is done to indicate a slide, which is more
 
the desicred effect than a vocal hop.
 I haxid't chosen to do this be-
cause I thought it looked a bit outlandish and strange.
 
a)  if we are unable to a
gree on either of the above al-
ternatives, they should be omitted entirely.
 
In no case are the rewrites to be used; they are wrong and musically
 
misleading.
 I am perfectly willing to dicker over this point because
 
it is a real problems but pending further discussion, I have asked in
 
the accompanying list of songs that the first alternative be followed
 
and the grace notes left as originally written.
 I have also written
 
an explanatory paragraph which can be inserted into the "advice to
 
teachers" section, depending on the final decision on this problem.
 
(See attached.)
 
7)  The "talking" songs are another real difficulty.  As a reader, when
 
I see chants written out on a single line as suggested by the music
 
editor, I feel they are intended to be intoned on a single note.
 These
 
are very dEfinitely not supposed to be done that way; indeed, Mrs. Jones
 
often uses a highly stressed and exaggerated inflection pattern which
 
really is just half-way between speaking and singing and which I tried
 
to suggest by putting the "
x" notes on the staff.  This latter method
 
is a totally standard
 indeed, routine
 practice in ethnomusicology;
 
as a matter of fact, I expected static from the music editor because
 
I had done it rather casually, not because I had done it at all.
 (In
 
some cases where the intonation pattern was not particularly emphasized
 
by Mrs# Jones, I had simply put all the x's on the same line of the
 
staff, which I realize, on looking them over again, really does imply
 
a monotone delivery,)  Then too, what is to be done about the songs
 
in which part is sung and part is chanted?  In some cases the editor
 
suggests using my system; in ethers hers.
 I would suggest one of the
 
following two compromise solutions:
 
a)  Those songs which do not have a çlearl  stressed
  
intonation pattern may be written out on a single line off the staff
 
as the music editor suggests; those which do should be left as I wrote
 
them, and an explanatory statement written into the preface of the
 
"advice to teachers" section.
 (See suggested paragraph enclosed.)
 
b)  If this seems too inconsistent (though I don't really
 
think it is, I will rewrite those few songs which I had done all on
 
one line of the staff and indicate their inflection pattern (again
 
with an explanatory statement, though here a new one would have to be
 
written).
 
Pending a final decision on the matter. I have followed system a) in
 
the song list enclosed and in my notes attached to the transcriptions.
 
8)  Concerning the particular songs mentioned in the music editor's
 
memorandum, Head and Shoulders is not musically incorrect as far as
 
I can see; the first measure starts on the second beat, that's all.
 
The rewrite is wrong; don't use ttk  I
've tried to clear up any pos-
sible confusion on the copy enclosed.  Shoo Turkey I have corrected
 
as requested; it is not now both clear and correct, please let me know.

J
ose htçe I like better in the staff style of noaation.  Cre n Gree  
the Crab ADDle Tree (which was the one the editor was objecting to.
 
not Green Sally UD) is correctly transcribed; the "little" notes are
 
indeed harmony and are indeed dissonant.  Actually, I chose to trans -
cribe this particular harmony part to demons
 tsate, without making a
 
huge point of it • that Afro-American folk-harmony is not all barbershop
 
and blendy; it can also be far-out and highly sophisticated.
 It seemed
 
to me that this transcription made a nice subtle contrast with such
 
items as old rui the Ro U1n
,  Pin which represents the other kind of
 
harmony this group uses and is comfortably corny.  Personally, I think
 
the harmony to Green G e,n the Crab A
pple Tie, is an absolute knockout,
 
though it is so unusual I am not surprised it was queried.
 
You will be horrified, no doubt, to hear that I am sending you another
 
whole letter under separate cover, deali n
g with some problems in the
 
text which I don't want to have lost in all the musical business.
 
Sorry about that.  In the meantime, please let me know if there are
 
any other questions that arise in connection with the music; I
'll try
 
to be a bit quicker next time
 I
've had a bad head cold since before
 
Thanksgiving and it slows we down.

Dear Mr .  Prettynans
 
A private word from me to you about the music.  Your music editor, who
 
is clearly highly competent in technical terms, equally clearly has had
 
little experience with this khhd of music nor the specialized problems
 
of interpreting it in print.  Plea e do not take her advice without
 
consulting met by re-working those grace notes, she made significant
 
changes in the actual melody line (not to mention the rhythm) in song
 
after song throughout the book, all in the blithe conviction that she
 
was straightening out the copy so it would look like the average music
 
score.  It is not the average music score, and I am still a bit open-
mouthed at her happy assumption that she understands how the tunes go
 
without ever having heard them.
 
I tried to write the letter which accompanies the manuscript in a way
 
that would not exacerbate an already tricky situation, and simply took
 
the tack that there could be no question but that my corrections would
 
stand as given.  I just hope that's true.  Due to her dashing style
 
with a Pentel and the fact that I had to re-correct about half her
 
corrections, the whole mess should actually be recopied at this point,
 
but I cannot spare the time until the Christmas vacation which starts
 
in two weeks, and. God knows, I am no music copyist anyway.
 
Grace notes are always a problem, and I well remember Ruth Crawford
 
Seeger's dissolving into tears of helpless rage over her correspondence
 
with h = music edttoris about them.  The real problem is this, a
c
a
d
e
m
i
-
cally trained (concert style) musicians road them as intrinsic parts
 
of the melody line with a whole lot of complicated rules concerning
 
how you allow time for them (notice, you editor particularly objected
 
to my grace notes going downward ater the melody note; that just
 
"
isn't done" in classical music).  Anyway, the typical feeling of an
 
academically trained musician is that grace notes are unnecessary
 
compèexities which should be avoided wherever possible since they are
 
"hard to read",  t
tssicoiogists, on the other hand,
 especially
 
ethnomusicologists
 read them as indications of the style of note
 
decoration used in a particular musical system and thus feel that their
 
inclusion is significant and important to proper understanding of the
 
whole musical approach of a culture.  Lay readers, in my experience,
 
tend sensibly to ignore I U grace notes and concentrate on the major
 
melodic line as indicated by the big notes.
 
I tried very hard to work in between all these systems of looking at
 
grace notes •
 I loft out enormous numbers I could have put in; I stuck
 
in just enough, I think, to make musicologists feel I was doing a
 
reasonable job of technically accurate transcription, and I kept the
 
melody line in the big notes.  This i
s why & U your editor's rewrites
 
2
.
 
of the grace notes are wrong; she got the tune mixed up with the orna-
mentation*  And this is why, in the other letter, I said that if we
 
could not agree on how to do them, they should come out.  However, I
 
do feel that that is a very undesirable alternative, because i
f they
 
are all omitted, no experienced folklorist or ethnomusicologist will
 
feel that the music has been handled with any degree of technical
 
accuracy.
 
I am angry with myself that I didn't take the time to have the copy
 
professionally done to begin with; as you may recall, the original
 
manuscript was stolen and my teen age son and I sat up all one night
 
working from my pencil roughs getting this one ready to replace it.
 
The fact that I niver get my "b" ster
na the right way round has probably
 
convinced your editor that I am a real musical novice, and she no doubt
 
feels that she is saving us all much embarrassment by "fixing it up",
 
(And, in her own areas of expertise, of course, so she is, and I am
 
grateful.)  I don't quite know what else to do at this point but to
 
shove the responsibility back on to you; if you feel she is going to
 
fix it up &R#in s please return it to me and it will just have to wait
 
until I can work on it two weeks from now.  The mos., I believe, is
 
okay as it stands now except for being so difficult to read.  The
 
two paragraphs I wrote on transcription style for inclusion in the
 
"Advice to Teachers and Parents" section as well as the amount of
 
academic garbage I put in the letter accompanying the manuscript
 
may help convince Miss Brooks that I know at least a bit about what
 
I am doing and soothe her shattered nerves a little.  I ft hope I
 
am handling this the right way.
 
There is another thing worrying me too.  The memorandum you enclosed
 
from Toni Rachtele mentions art work.  This is the first I have heard
 
of art work being included in the book.  Who is the artist?  I
s he
 
black?  Can I see samples of his work?  I would really rather have
 
the book not appear at all than covered over with cutesy-pie kids
 
or Uncle Tom.
'y drawings.
 Please forgive my bluntness on this point,
 
but I have a friend whose book was partially wrecked by a maladroit
 
art editor with extraordinarily bad taste in just this area, so I
 
know that it S M happen even in the largest of publishing houses.
 
And the movement and stance patterns are so important in this particular
 
book, it would really wreck it if they were badly done.
 a it is being
 
illustrated in real detail, would it help if the artist and I were put
 
in touch?  I could refer him to some photographs, for example, that
 
might be of help.
 
Actually, I
'm just getting more and more nervous about the whole book,
 
I guess •
 Five years ago, when I started work on it, it seemed an inter-
esting thing to do and possibly oven a little bit useful.  As the
 
polarization between bi ack and white increases across the country, I
 
feel less and less sure of the point of the whole project, and every
 
day's delay increases the number of readers who are going to take it
 
as just one more example of white scholarly paternalism and exploita-
tion*
 
You know, when this book comes out, if ever it does, I should very
 
much like to invite you out for a drink.  You will be surprised, I
 
3
.
 
suspect, to discover that I an really not the nit-picking and
 
slightly neurotic personality I appear to myself in all my letters
 
to you.  Maybe it's book birth psngs.  Anyway, until that happy day,
 
cord
 ial y,
 
Bees Lomax Haves
 
P
.S.  I just found out that my brother, Alan Lomax e was the person who
 
took the p
icture I
 sent you of Bessie looking out into the distance
 
with the kerchief round her head.  He seems to be the key to the
 
photograph problem.  Can't you just get him on the phone and ask him
 
where to get some good up- to-date photographs
 I an sure he could put
 
you in touch with Bob Yellin or that girl photographer I mentioned
 
before, or maybe he even has some more recent ones that he has taken
 
himself.
 
Notes to accompany music transcripttonss  Step It Down
 12/4/69
 
I
.  GO TO SLEEPY LITTLE BABY  Edited version okay.  I deleted one dot
 
in the second line which I believe must have been a blot or something.
 
2
.  JUMP THAT JODY  Edited version okay.
 
3
.  RIDE CHARLEY RIDE  Edited version okay.
 
4.  TOM TOM GREEDY GUT  Suggested treatment okay.  This is one chant
 
where infl3ction pattern is not particularly important.
 
5.  GREEN SALLY UP  Edited version is not correct.  Grace notes should
 
be left as originally written; rewritten version changes the tune.
 
I have filled in second verse words as requested.
 
6
 •
 ONE RY TWO.
 RY  Suggested treatment okay.
 
7
.  ONE SAW TWO SAW  Suggested treatment okay.
 
8.  HEAD AND SHOULDERS BABY.  This song starts on the second beat of
 
the measure,  This could be indicated by starting the measure with a
 
quarter rest, but each subsequent verse also begins on the second beat
 
wt
hhout pause after the word "three" at the and of the
.  I can't
 
see any other way to do it than the one in the original, but perhaps
 
writing the first ending all the way out, showing "
knee and ankle"
 
coming in the same measure as the last note of the first verse would
 
help.
 Seo copy.)  Do not use rewrite; it i
s wrong.  (By the way, I
 
tried putting the whole thing into 2/4 time in order to obviate having
 
to change to 2/4 and back to 4/4, and in hopes it would all look clearer;
 
it doesn't work.)
 
9
.  HAMBONE  This can be written on the single line if preferable;
 
inflection doesn't matter much here
 •
 However, I do suggest my emended
 
version for the clap pattern written at the bottom of the page in pencil
 
(
over the green question mark).  I realize it's unconventional, but I
 
have done a lot of teaching of these rhythms, and I find that the more
 
clearly the triplet effect can be visualized for people, the more easily
 
they get the idea.
 
10.  JUBA  This chanting i
n so close to singing  . actually the whole
 
thing slides back and forth between the two
 that I prefer the version
 
in which the chant part i
s written out on the music staff with approximate
 
pitch indicated.  Also note the fourth line first measure has been
 
wrongly corrected in both the original and the editor/s recopy.  Also
 
in my transcription, there is another wrong correction which was not
 
copied onto the edited version.
 
U.  SKIP TO THE BARBERSHOP.  This is a tough one; the inflection pattern
 
is not realty stressed, but it should be chanted with much expression.
 
I have put an indication to that effect along the tempo line and I guess
 
then it can be written out on the straight line as the music editor suggest
 
2
.
 
12.  JUST FROM THE KITCHEN
 Edited version is incorrectt please leave
 
as originally written.
 
13.  SHOO TURKEY  I really goofed on the verse ending problem and have
 
tried to correct it accurately on my own transcription page.  Rewritten
 
version is incorrect 1 but that is my fault,  fleas. let me know if this
 
is not clear.
 
14.  KNOCK JIM CROW.  Please return grace notes to their original states
 
however, I did some fresh editing here myself.  Please note change in
 
eighth note pairs to dotted eighth with a sixteenth.  Actually this song
 
is somewhere in the middle between the two, but I find on looking it
 
over after a lapse of time that the way I now have it feels to me cloedr
 
to the rhythmic pulse of the song.
 
15.  JOSEPHINE.  I like the version written out on the staff lines much'
 
better, as in my original, but I do approve the music editor's change
 
of the second part of the song from 2/4 to 4/4.
 It is much easier to
 
read.
 
16.
 ELEPHANT FAIR.  I strongly p
refer the version written out on the
 
staff lines herel this song is "talked" withoexaggerated expressiveness.
 
17.  PIZZA PIZZA MIGHTY MOE  Inflection isn't so important beret can
 
be handled on the single line as the editor suggests.
 
18.  GREEN GREEN THE CRAB APPLE TREE  This is correctly transcribed
 
though I grant it is highly dissonant.  I see no technical error in it
 
except for some fades in the xerox which make it hard to tell if the
 
notes a
re half or quarter.  I have re-copied it to make sure it is
 
clear.  Perhaps the "
little" notes might be more clearly written if'
 
their flags went up over the melody line, but if this were done here,
 
I suppose the other harmony parts should be handled the sam e way.
 
19.  JOHNNY CUCKOO  Both versions correct.
 
20.  OH GREENFIELDS ROXIE  Okay.
 
21.  GO IN AND OUT THE WINDOW.  Okay in both version..  I discovered here
 
an original copying error of my own which I corrected in both versions.
 
22,  DRAW ME A BUCKET OF WATER.  Okay as is.
 
23.  NANA THREAD NEEDLE  The correction to half-notes is right and should
 
stand as edited.  I also agree with the elimination of the word "I'm"
 
in the lead-in to the chorus, as the two parts do follow each other
 
directly.
 (Don't write in "verse" or "chorus" howeverl this is simply
 
a two-part game.)  Could you please have the word "I'm" deleted or
 
simply put in parentheses in the text page too?
 
24.  LITTLE JOHNNY BROWN
 kay
 
25.  EAST COAST LINE  Suggested treatment okay
 
26.  SIR MISTER BROWN  Please leave grace notes as ortginal y written.
 
27.  WAY DOWN YONDER SOMETIMES  Please leave grace notes as originally
 
written.
 
3
.
 
28.  SOUP SOUP  Okay as is.
 
29.  PUNCHINELLO  The "
suggested treatment" is fine with me (as is
 
the placing of the claps on a line above the staff throughout the book).
 
l
b
,wever, I don't understand the deletion marks in the line marked
 
"
E)nma's clap"s you can't delete those eighth rests and have the bar come
 
out even.  Perhaps I don't understand.
 
30.  LITTLE SALLY WALKER. The edited version of all three is all right
 
with me ete ptLonexception of the grace notes in version #2.  They
 
should not be written as even sixteenth notes but as originally transcribed
 
31.  UNCLE JESSIE  Please leave change to 2/4 as originally written
 
even though for only one measure.  If you feel this is an unnecessary'
 
complication for this particular tune. I
'm willing to argue the point
 
but in that case the ending will have to be changed and the dance
 
directions looked at again.
 
32.  WAY DOWN YONDER IN THE BRICKYARD  Please leave grace notes as
 
originally transcribed.
 
33.  WAY GO LILY  I am unclear about the deletion mark on the second
 
lines what is being deleted?  Was there an extra mark of some kind on
 
the original page?  The quarter rest, of course, is necessary.  Other
 
than this, this is okay.
 
34.  STEAL UP, YOUNG LADY  Grace note should be left as originally trans-
cr
i b
e
d
 
trans-
cribedl otherwise okay.
 
35.  POSSUM-LA  My opinion is that the quarter rest at the end of the
 
first chorus (fourth line of music) should stand as originally written.
 
What follows is not the second verse but simply a verse variattq  
which can be put in ad lib and has an independent pick-up.
 
36.  RANKY TANK  Mrs. Jones' exaggerated inflection pattern hero seems
 
to me extremely important in giving this chant interest and swing.
 
I greatly prefer having this stand as originally transcribed on the
 
staff lines.
 
37.  COONSHINE  Re-flagging is okay with me.  The last note should be
 
"g" rather than "a".
 (See copy c
orrection).
 
38.  SANDY REE  Okays please note deletions indicated in green.
 
39.  DANIEL  Please leave grace note as originally written,
 
40.  ZUDIE"O  Both edited and original versions okay.  Was any substantive
 
change made in the edited version?  (
I didn't notice any and just want
 
to be sure.)
 
41.
 I
 •
 M GOING AWAY TO SEE AUNT DINAH  The re-phrasing of the rhythm
 
is all right with mej harmony parts should be included.
 
42.  BOBIA NEEDLE  Okay
 
43.  WHOSE BAG IS MY GOLD RING  Okay.
 
4.
 
44.  MISS LUCY  Oh heck, let's leave the pitch variation in the chant
 
part at the end inp it makes it so much more dramatic, don't you
 
think?
 Otherwise, okay.
 
45.  HORSE AND BUGGY  Reflagging okay with me.
 
46.  WON'T YOU LET THE BIRDIE OUT?  Okay as edited.
 
47.  LONDON BRIDGE  In version #1 (
? e. Jones') please leave the grace
 
note as written.  Otherwise okay.
 
48.  ALL HID  Re-copied version okay except for grace note changesi please
 
leave as originally written.  Also note one correction on page two of
 
the editor's version.
 
49.  I HAD AN OLD ROOSTER  May.
 
50.  PRETTY PEAR TREE  I made a mistake in this one in the original copy
 
and have attached a correction which should be included.  Otherwise,
 
the re-written version is okay.
 
51.  WAY DOWN ON THE BINGO FARM  Suggested treatment i. fine.
 
52.  HAVE COURAGE TO SAY NO  Please leave grace note as originally written.
 
53.
 BROTHER RABBIT AND MISTER RAILROAD'S TAXERS  "Falsetto-like voice"
 
is the better of the azatlable possibilities, I think.
 
54.  OLD BILL THE ROLLING PIN  Both edited and original versions look
 
okay to me.
 
55.  RABBIT AND THE POSSUM  Grace note should be left as in original,
 
56.  AIN'T IT HARD TO BE A FARMER  The third full measure actually does
 
contain that strange full lengthening of the "
b" note and should be left
 
as I originally wrote it.  Otherwise okay.
 
57.  PEEP SQUIRREL  I tied the pairs of notes together in the first It
he
 
because the word is actually pronounced "
aquirl" rather than "
squir rel".
 
This seems perfectly clear to m
 but can be changed if the editor feels
 
it is confusing.

Dear Nr • PrettyTnan $
 
Is not answering mail a policy of yours?  I sent you all that music
 
revision plvs  two  letters over a month ago and, had it not been for a
 
note from Josephine Rogers # I wouldn't even know if you'd gotten it.
 
Honestly.
 
I delayed the accompanying editorial revisions thinking I would surely
 
hear something from you concerning the music and I could then do all
 
the work at one session; howeverg I have now given up and gone ahead
 
on my own.
 I assume you realize that this will
, have to be done again
 
if things don't get moving this spring, as somehow or other, other
 
publishers do keep on putting new books out.
 
The currently necessary corrections follow, and I
'll apologize right
 
now all at once for those which are the results of my own errors; the
 
others are duo to the fact that a year has passed since I last went
 
over the manuscript and brought it up to date,
 3ince I am not sure
 
that the pagination on my copy is the same as yours. I am referring'
 
to my corrections under the appropriate song or game title.
 
1)  I find that Emma Ramsey spells her name Ramsey rather than
 
Rams y as I had thought,
 This should be corrected at the end of the
 
Acknowledgements section, in the footnote at the bottom of the third
 
page of the general Introduction, in the first page of the introduction
 
to the section titled "baby Games and Plays", in two places in the
 
introduction to the play "This Little i
i
.pgy" and in any other place
 
I may have overlooked.
 
2)  There are several errors in the introduction to "Tom Tom Greedy
 
Gut", so I have retyped it and a corrected page is enclosed for substi-
tution.
 
3)
 In the words of "Josephine", the first time the word "ball"
 
occurs (
I've got a bell of cord), it should be underlined to indicate
 
an action takes place at that point.
 
4)
 In "Nana Thread Needle" I notice I spelled the term "nana"
 
differently in different places since I didn't know how to spell it
 
to begin with.
 Lorenzo Turner says it is the Gullah word for "mama"
 
or "older woman" anT .
1
1 suggest we follow his s p
elling; could you please
 
have it checked in the Table of Contents, underneath the music transcrip-
tion and in the introduction to the song, as well as in the Annotations
 
section?
 
5)  In the game directions that parallel the song words in "Way
 
Down Yonder in the Brickyard", the second direction now roads:  "Center
 
player stops in front of a ring player and both '
step it down' four
 
2)
 
times."  Please Cut the phrase "four times"; this is a case where
 
loss specificity is helpful.
 In addition, the word "
swing" in the
 
last line of the song text (Oh, swing your love and turn around)
 
should be underlined.
 
6)
 In the section titled "Note to teachers",  I would suggest
 
changing the title to "Note to teachers and parents".
 I also added
 
two paragraphs in my last letter to you; I assume those are already'
 
included.
 
7)  In the section titled "Note to scholars" in paragraph 4, please
 
cut the sentence beginning "The original key..." (assuming we are agreed
 
upon cutting the key indication).  Also, in the same section, the last
 
word of paragraph 7 should be changed from "References" to "Annotations".
 
8)  I have added six books to the Bibliography and made the resultant
 
necessary additions to the Annotations section.  Copies of both are
 
enclosed, though I notice that 1 failed to put the new additions into
 
the "Annotations" section in alihabetical order.
 I
'm sorry about that,
 
but I really don't think it's especially important to have them alpha-
betically arranged anyway.
 Change thor
n or not as you think most appro-
priate.
 
9)  I do think, though, that in the final printing, pagination for
 
the original songs should be indicated in the Annotation section.
 (
In
 
other words, each entry should read something likes "Tom Tom Greedy
 
Gut
 P. -
 and then the cf
 a.)  There is no point i
n my doing
 
this since I don't have the correct page numbora $ perhaps someone at
 
your and could tak 4r
n that chore.
 
10)
 I think, sadly, that the last two paragraphs of the Introduction
 
to the Dance section should be cut (from" This still bothers me** **
$
 until
 
the end).  They already sound dated.
 I
'm sorry to lose thor
n, for
 
I thought they made a nice point, but I
'm afraid that topical allusions
 
are not too suitable for a book of this sort.
 (
I'd like to hope that
 
it will stay in print for a little while anyway.)
 
11)  I noticed that the descriptions of "
stepping it down" in the
 
clapping section and the "Jumps and Skips" section are not consistent
 
(cf. the introduction 4f both sections).
 This is because, frankly,
 
Mrs. Jones "
steps it down"differently depending on whether she is
 
dancing or clapping.
 I have rewritten the description in the "Jumps
 
and Skips" section in a way which I hope clears up the problem without
 
making a big noise about it.
 I have retyped the whole page in question
 
for substitution; the only substantive change, however, is in the final
 
paragraph
 the description of the "Step it down" stop.
 
I hope all this is clear and that it will cause minimal trouble.
 Please
 
let me know if there is anything further I should do and what you think
 
the publication schedule will be.
 I am terribly anxious to get this
 
show on the road.
 
Sincerely,
 
Bess Lomax Hawes

"Daniel".  I had included them in a first version of the book and later taken
 
them out; obviously, I an ambivalent on the question and would appreciate
 
any reactions you might have.  "Coonshins" I had eliminated because I don't

I am sending a copy of this letter to Josephine Rogers, and will also
 
write Al Brackman t
oday to advise him of the inclusion of two additional
 
s
ongs.  I assume he will check the copyright s

brother Alan and advise you accordingly.
 
I
 will be seeing Mrs. Jones this cMing week and will go over the con-
tract with her and get her signature.  You should receive the signal aggee-

he end of the week.  I hope this delay has not held up the publi-
cation of t
he book; i
t would be wonderful it it could come out in the fall

Please don't hesitate t
o send me any editorial reactions or comments
 
you might have.  I
'm anxious to help make the book as good as t*nc e be.
