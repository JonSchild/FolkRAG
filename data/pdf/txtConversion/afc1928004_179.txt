GO, EDMUND, JOIN THE MARTIAL THRONG. 
Go Edmund, join the martial throng, 
And nobly seek an honour'd name, 
Go pour the tide of war along, 
And climb the rugged steep of fame. 
Yct, yet forgive a 
maiden's fear, 
Whilst valour's toilsome paths you prove 
Oh ! sometimes wipe the pensive tear. 
And sweetly think of me and love. 
On Erin's sod you drew your breath. 
From her you caught the patriot glow, 
Whose children spurn the thoughts of death, 
And foremost meet the daring foe; 
Yet whilst with pride you scorn to fly, 
Or from the brow of battle move; 
Oh! sometimes breathe the tender sigh, 
And dearly think of me and love. 
Should Fate your early fall decree, 
Far, far from Erin's parent shore, 
Where ne'er my doating eyes might sa , 
Those looks of manly beauty more; - 
To heav'n should rise the fervent prayer, 
To meet in lasting bliss above; 
Within my breast the wound I'd bear, 
And meekly die for you and love.

IRISH WAR SONG. 
Bright sun, before whose glorious ray, 
Our Pagan fathers bent the knee; 
Whose pillar altars yet can say, 
When time was young our sires were free— 
Who seest how fallen their offspring be— 
Our matrons' tears—our patriot's gore ; 
We swear before high heaven and thee, 
The Saxon bolds us slaves no mere 
Our Sunburst on the Roman foe 
Flaslid vengeance once in foreign fic4d— 
On Clontarfs Olin lay scathed low 
What power the Sea-kings fierce could wield 
Bein Burl) might say whose cloven shield 
'Neath blooly hoofs was trampled o'ur; 
And by these memories high, we yield 
Our limbs to Saxon chains no more ! 
The lairseach wild, whose trembling string 
had long the " song of sorrow" spoke, 
Shall bid the wild Rosg-Cata sing 
The curse and crime of Saxon yoke. 
And, by each heart his bondage broke— 
Each exile's sigh on distant shore— 
Each martyr 'neath the headman's stroke— 
The Saxon holds us slaves no more I 
Send the loud war-cry o'er the main— 
Your Sunburst to tbe breezes spread ; 
That slogan rends the heaven in twain— 
The edrth reels back beneath your tread, 
Ye Saxon despots, hear, and dread— 
Your march o'er patriot hearts is o'er— 
That shout hath told—that tramp bath said, 
Our country's sons are slaves no more

LAMENT FOR THE DEATH OF EOGHAN 
RUADFI 0 
NEIL. 
Time- 10th Nov., 1649. 
Scene—Ormond's Camp, County Waterford. 
Speakers —a 
Veteran of Owen O'Neil 's clan, and one of the horse.. 
men just arrived with an account of his death. 
" 
Did they dare, did they dare to slay Owen Roe O'Neil l" 
" 
Yes, they slew with poison him they feared to meet with steel." 
May God wither up their hearts! May their blood cease to flow! 
May they walk in living death, who poisoned Owen Roe! 
Though it break my heart to hear, say again the bitter words." 
"From Derry, against Cromwell, he marched to measure swords; 
But the weapon of the Saxon met him on his way, 
And he died at Cloc Ua.ctair, upon Saint Leonard's Day." 
" 
Wail, wail ye for The Mighty One ! 
Wail, wail ye for the Dead; 
Quench the hearth, and hold the breath— with ashes strew the head. 
How tenderly we loved him ! How deeply we deplore! 
Holy Saviour! but to think we shall never see him more. 
Sagest in the council was he, kindest in the hall, 
Sure we never won a 
battle—'Twas Owen won them all. 
Had he lived—had be lived—our dear country had been free; 
But he's dead, but he's dead, and ' tis slaves we'll ever be. 
O'Farrell and Clanricartle, Preston and Red Hugh, 
Audley and Macilahon—ye are valiant, wise, and true; 
But—what are ye all to our darling who is gone? 
The Rudder of our Ship was he, our Castle's corner-stone! 
Wail, wail him through the Island ! 
Weep, weep for our pride! 
Would that on the battle-field our gallant chief had died! 
Weep the Victor of Rehm Burl; —weep him, young men and old ; 
Weep for him, ye women—, our Beautiful lies cold! 
We thought you would not die—we were sure you would not go, 
And leave us in our utmost need to Cromwell's cruel blow— 
Sheep without a 
shepherd, when the snow shuts out the sky: 
Oh! why did you leave us, Owen h Why did you die 
Soft as woman's was your voice, O'Neil ! bright was your eye 
Oh: why did you leave us, Owen why did you die 
Your troubles are all over, you're at rest with God on high; 
But we're slaves, and we're orphans, Owen! why did you die I"

THE PRICE OF FREEDOM. 
Man of Ireland—heir of sorrow— 
Wronged, insulted, scorned, oppressed—. 
Wilt thou never see that morrow 
When thy weary heart may rest ? 
Lift thine eyes, thou outraged creature ; 
Nay, look up, for Man thou art— 
Man in form, in frame, and feature— 
Why not act man's godlike part ? 
Think, reflect, inquire, examine, 
Is't for this God gave you birth— 
With the spectre look of famine, 
Thus to creep along the earth ? 
Does this world contain no treasures 
Fit for thee, as Man, to wear ?— 
Does this life abound in pleasures, 
And thou askest not to share ? 
Look ! the nations are awaking— 
Every chain that bound them burst, 
At the crystal fountain slaking 
With parched lips their fever thirst ! 
Ignorance, the demon, fleeing, 
Leaves unlocked the fount they sip— 
Wilt thou not, thou wretched being, 
Stoop and cool thy burning lip ? 
History's lessons, if thoult read 'em, 
All proclaim this truth to thee ; 
Knowledge is the price of freedom— 
Know thyself, and thou art free 
[1] 
PRICE FREEDOM.—[CONCLUDED. 
Know, oh Man! thy proud vocation— 
Stand erect, with calm, clear brow— 
Happy, happy! were our nation 
If thou hadst that knowledge now! 
Know thy wretched, sad condition— 
Know the ills that keep thee so— 
Knowledge is the sole physician— 
Thou wert healed if thou didst know! 
Those who crush, and scorn, and slight thee— 
Those to whom you once would kneel— 
Were the foremost then to right thee, 
If thou felt as thou shouldst feel! 
Not as beggars lowly bending— 
Not in sighs, and groans, and tears— 
But a 
voice of thunder sending 
Through thy tyrant brother's ears I 
Tell him he is not thy master— 
Tell him of man's common lot— 
Feel life has but one disaster— 
To be a 
slave, and know it not! 
If thou knew what knowledge giveth— 
It thou knew how blest is he 
Who in Freedom's presence liveth, 
Thou wouldst die, or else be free! 
Round about he looks in gladness— 
Joys in heaven, and earth, and sea— 
Scarcely heaves a 
sigh of sadness, 
Save in thoughts of such as thee!

THE UNION 
How did they pass the Union? 
By perjury and fraud ; 
By slaves, who sold for place or gold 
Their country and their God: 
By all the savage acts that yet 
Have followed England's track: 
The pitchcap and the bayonet, 
The gibbet and the rack 
And thus was passed the Uuion 
By Pitt and Castlereagh: • 
Could Satan send for such an end 
More worthy tools than they ? 
How thrive we by the Union? 
Look round your native land! 
hi ruined trade and wealth decayed 
See slavery's surest brand; 
Our glory as a 
nation gone --
Our substance drained away— 
& 
wretched province trampled on. 
Is all we've left to-day. 
Then curse with me the Union, 
That juggle foul and base, 
The baneful root that bore such fruit 
Of ruin and disgrace. 
And shall it last, this Union. 
To grind and waste us so ? 
0 
er hill and lea, from sea to sea, 
All Ireland thunders, No 
Eight million nceks are stiff to bow— 
We know our might as men— 
We conquered once hrfore, and now 
'We'll conquer once again ; 
And rend the cursed Union, 
And fling it to the wind— 
And Ireland's laws and Ireland's cause, 
Alone our hearts shall bind I 
"ogl 
J
it 
t 
OURSELVES :ALONE. 
The work that should to-day be wrought 
Defer not till to-morrow; 
The help that should within be sought, 
Scorn from without to borrow. 
Old maxims these— yet stout and true— 
They speak in trumpet tone; 
To do at once what is to do. 
And trust ourselves alone. 
Too long our Irish hearts we schooled 
In patient hope to bide; 
By dreams of Engilsh justice fooled, 
And English tongues that lied-
That hour of weak delusion's past 
The empty dream has flown; 
Our hope and strength, we find at last, 
Is in ourselves alone. 
Aye! bitter hate, or cold neglect, 
Or lukewarm love at best; 
Is all we've found, or can expect, 
We aliens of the west. 
No fri-nd beyond her own green shore, 
Can Erin truly own; 
Yet stronger is her trust, therefore, 
In her brave sons alone. 
Remember when our lot was worse— 
Sunk, trampleMato the dust; 
'Twas long our weakness and our curse, 
In stranger aid to trust. 
And if at length, we proudly trod 
On bigot laws o'erthrown; 
Who won that struggle t Under God, 
Ourselves—ourselves alone. 
Oh, let its memory be enshrined 
In Ireland's heart forever; 
It proves a 
banded people's mind 
Must win in just endeavor. 
It shows how wicked to despair, 
How weak to idly groan— 
If ills at others' hands ye bear, 
The cure is in your own. 
The foolish word " impossible." 
At once, for aye disdain; 
No power can bar a 
people's will 
A people's right to gain. 
Be bold, united, firmly set, 
Nor flinch in word or tone— 
We'll be a 
glorious nation yet, 
Redeemed—erect—alone.

STANZAS. 
ty THOMAS FURLONG. 
[Supposed to be written on the night that the Act of Legislative 
Union became the law of the land.] 
Oh ! Ireland, my country—the hour 
Of thy pride and thy splendor bath pass'd ; 
And the chain that was spurned in the moment of power, 
hangs heavy around thee at last. 
There are marks in the fate of each clime— 
There are turns in the fortunes of men, 
But the changes of realms, or the chances of time, 
Can never restore thee again. 
Thou art chain'd to the wheel of the foe, 
By links that the world shall not sever, 
With thy tyrant. thro' storm and thro' calm thou shalt go, 
And thy sentence is bondage forever. 
Thou art doom'd for the thankless to toil, 
Thou art left for the proud to disdain. 
And the blood of thy sons, and the wealth of thy soul, 
Shall be wasted and wasted in vain. 
Thy riches with taunts shall be taken, 
Thy valor with coldness repaid, 
And of millions who see thee thus sunk and forsaken. 
Not one shall stand forth in thine aid, 
In the nations thy place is left void, 
Thou art lost in the list of the free, 
Even realms, by the plague of the earthquake destroy'd, 
May revive-.-but no hope is tor thee.

THE IRISH MOTHER'S LAMENT. 
rm kneeling by your grave, aroon! the autumn sun shines bright, 
Flinging upon the grassy mound a 
flood of golden light; 
The flowers I 
tended for your sake are drooping one by one. 
While I 
must weep in hopeless grief above your grave, my son. 
The withered leaves are showering down, they cannot break your 
rest; 
And fair and bright the gorgeous pall they've flung upon your breast; 
I 
saw them bud and blossom forth, beneath the soft spring sky, 
But little dreamed that you, my son, should be the first to die. 
I 
knew that want had paled your cheek, that hunger cast its blight 
Upon the crimson lip, and eye, whose very glance was light! 
I 
knew thy powerful arm grew weak, the sweet voice lost its tone; 
Yet still watched on, in trembling fear, till death the struggle won. 
I 
longed to yield with cheerfulness the treasure lent to me, 
But vainly strove to bow the will, although I 
bent the knee. 
Ohl torrible the inward strife that rends the mother's heart! 
They only know who've felt the pang, how hard it is to part. 
Was there not plenty in the land the earth gave forth her store— 
The glad and fruitful mother earth, with riches brimming o'er; 
Not for the slave who tilled the soil tho garnered wealth was won; 
Our tyrant masters gorged their fill, and murdered thee, my son! 
Were there not stately homes enough, that our rooftree must fall, 
On the forsaken green hillside I 
see the blackened wall; 
Be calm, my heart, in faith abide, God will not still endure 
That tyrant hands shall desecrate the dwellings of the poor. 
The dwellings of the virtuous poor, the homes of poverty, 
Are sacred in the sight of God though humble they may be, 
Beneath the holy cabin roof the truest prayers may rise, 
And many a 
suffering spirit there, is fashioned for the skies 
Mavourneen! hark, the bitter winds are howling round your borne, 
Sleep on in peace, my own one, sleep, your mother soon will come; 
The autumn leaves are showering down upon your place of rest, 
And bright and beautiful the pall that wraps your gentle breast.

THE ANTI-IRISH IRISHMAN. 
From polar seas to torrid climes, 
Where'er the trace of man is found, 
What common feeling marks our kind, 
And sanctifies each spot of ground ? 
What virtue in the human heart. 
The finest tribute can command 
The dearest, purest, holiest best, 
The lasting love of Fatherland. 
Then who's the wretch that basely spurns, 
The ties of country, kindred, friends— 
That barters every nobler aim, 
For sordid views—tor private ends ? 
One slave alone on earth you'll find, 
Through Nature's universal span, 
So lost to virtue, dead to shame. 
The anti-Irish Irishman. 
Our fields are fertile, rich our floods, 
Our mountains bold, majestic, grand, 
Our air is balm and every breeze, 
Wings health around o.ur native land, 
But who despises all our charms, 
And mocks her gifts whereer he can ? 
Who, he, the Norman's sneaking slave, 
The anti-Irish Irishman. 
The Norman—spawn of fraud and guile, 
Ambitions sought our peaceful shore, 
And leagued with native guilt, despoiled, 
And deluged Erin's fields with gore! 
Who gave the foeman footing here ? 
What wretch unholy led her van? 
The prototype of modern slaves, 
An anti-lrish Irishman. 
13 
TEUS ANTI-IRISH, 
&C.—[CONCLUDED. 
For ages rapine ruled our plains, 
And slaughter raised " his red right hand ; 
And virgins shriek'd l—and roof-trees blaz'd— 
And desolation swept the land, 
And who would not those ills at rest, 
Or aid the patriotic plan, 
lo burst his country's galling chains? 
The anti-Irish Irishman! 
Hurrah! " the sunburst!"— Once again, 
Our ° rill:mine is on the gale, 
With shamrock wreaths encircling, 
The blazon'd glorious words " Repeal!" 
The coward slave that quits his post, 
Let Argus eyes the traitor scan, 
And infamy eternal brand.

BATTY DARLING. (A 
PARODY) 
001, Katty, my darlin', your rest I'll be breaking, 
For time crow of the ould cock is heard on the hill, 
An' the dew trout his cape, now the peeler is shakin', 
Yet. ICatty my damn', you're slumbering still. 
Och ! have yes forgotten the promise ye's made me, 
or yer bett and yer board was'nt I 
to have part, 
For _a 
week, for a 
month, if I 
liked it forever ; 
Then, dearest, wake up, hear the voice of my heart. 
Wake, Ratty, my darlin', arise from the floor now, 
And the glint that is out with a 
Weiler light .; 
Och ! where i 
the bell, that once hung at thy door, now 
Arise in thy beauty and let's in to- night. 
Och ! Katt v, °eh 7 
murder! the rain is last 
To think now, that only a 
door should us part, 
May be you've no ears, so yo-. can't hear me bawlin', 
Oh why are you deat to the voice of my heart.

THE WEST'S ASLEEP. 
When all beside a 
vigil keep, 
The West's asleep, the West's asleep— 
Alas ! and well may Erin weep, 
When Connacht lies in slumber deep ; 
There lake and plain smile fair litid tree, 
'Mid rocks—their guardian chivalry— 
Sing oh ! let man learn liberty 
From crashing wind and lashing sea. 
That chainless wave and lovely land, 
Freedom and Nationhood demand, 
Be sure, the great God never plann'd 
For slumbering slaves a 
home so grand. 
And, long a 
brave and haughty race, 
_Honored and sentinelled the place— 
Sing oh ! not even their sons' disgrace, 
Can quite destroy their glory's trace. 
For often in O'Connor's van, 
To triumph dasli'd each Connacht clan— 
And fleet as deer the Normans ran, 
Through Coirrsliabh Pass and Ard 
And later times saw deeds as brave ; 
And glory guards Clanriearde's grave— 
Sing oh! they died their land to save, 
At Aughrim's slopes and Shannon's wave. 
And if, when all a 
vigil keep, 
The West's asleep, the West's asleep— 
A'as ! aid well may Erin weep, 
That Connacht lies in slumber deep. 
But—hark I—seine voice like thunder spike. 
ne We Cs awake, the West's awake!"— 
Sing oh I 
hurrah I 
let England quake, 
We'll \Vateh tili death for Erin's sake!

HE SAID THAT HE WAS NOT OUR BROTHER. 
He said that he was not our brother— 
The mongrel! he said what he knew— 
No, Erie! our dear Island mother, 
He ne'er had his black blood from you? 
And what though the milk of your bosom 
Gave vigour and health to his veins — 
He was but a 
foul foreign blossom, 
Blown hither to poison our plains! 
He said that the sword had enslaved us— 
That still at its point we must kneel,— 
The liar !—though often it braved us, 
We cross'd it with hardier steel ! 
This witness his Richard—our vassal! 
His Essex— whose plumes we trod down! 
His Willy—whose peerless sword tassel 
We tarnished at Limerick town 
No I 
falsehood and feud were our evils, 
While force not a 
fetter could twine— 
Come Northmen—come Normans—come Devils! 
We give them our Sparth to the chine! 
And if, once again he would try us,

THE APPEAL. 
.Weary and spin - wore, 
Bleeding front every pore, 
Wrong casting more and more 
Wrecks on her way ; 
Rudderless, pilotless, shifiless, in sore distress, 
Ireland lies helplessly prostrate to-day. 
Struggling for life and air. 
Foot sore and bosom bare, 
Mourning her hopes so fair, 
Faded and gone ; 
Painfully, wearily, hard set and drearily, 
Grasping at shadows that ever flit on, 
Who shall assuage her pain ? 
Who shall bid freedom reign ? 
Who bring back peace again, 
home to our isle ? [ him, 
True souls shall meet him. and strong hearts shall greet 
Reflecting the sunrise of liberty's smile. 
Who will our purpose aid ? 
Where shall our choice be made? 
Where the men not afraid 
Erin to free ? 
Deceived and deceiving, betrayed when believing, 
The bitter fruit bearing of long slavery. 
Prophets and Saints of old, 
Sires of our Fathers bold, 
Rise from your graves so cold, 
Wakethtlie few— 
The faithful and true men, a 
host, tho' a 
few men, 
Who'll shield us from danger, and teach us to DO. 
Ali. they will defend us, 
And rise to befriend us, 
Whom kind heaven sends us, 
They never forget 
How we kissed the grim halter, for love of the Altar, 
And sealed with our lifeblood the bond of their debt. 
Down in the forest glen; 
Hiding in savage den. 
Fighting the Saxon men, 
Years ot the past ; 
Smiling in sorrow's face, xvrithing in dark disgrace, 
'Yielding e'en life itself; true to the last. 
Oft on the scaffold high 
Rang Erin's dearest cry, 
Up to the listening sky, 
" 
Soggarth Afton ;" 
amidst us 
The hell-hounds who whipped us, stood awe-struck 
That they ere came between us, oli,'Erin ma vrone! 
Brave were the hearts that bled, 
Bitter the tears that shed, 
Never from danger fled, 
Never from shame; 
And thevfitinted not measure, of blood or of treasure, 
To shelter their Soggarth, and halo his name, 
Priests of our Irish fluid, 
Bishops, whom Heaven's,litind 
Placed in your high command, 
Pause well to-day; 
Ruin and vice are rife, save us from bitter strife, 
Wolves gather round us, to trample and slay. 
Alas, for the poison weeds 
Scatter their noxious seeds, 
Gladly the serpent feeds 
Thoughts such as freeze [us, 
The old feelings that bound us, and treacherously round 
Spread doubts of that old love, that grew at your knees. 
Ere the dark storm gathers, 
0 God of our fathers, 
Awaken the sleeping, give strength to the brave, 
And let Ireland's dark story, 
Grow bright in the glory 
Of the priesthood who raised her from slavery's grave,

O'BRIEN THE GOOD-. 
A 
patriot's statue! a 
monument built, 
Not to honor some scion of alien blood; 
Not raised to emblazen the triumph of guilt, 
But graved with the MUM; of O'Brien the Good I 
A statue to him — the undaunted, the proud, 
The soul whom no bribe could corrupt or allure ; 
//is form raised aloft o'er the eddying crowd, • 
Lis face in the gaze of the rich and the poor. 
Oh, place it not there, lest his presence should cast 
A reproach on the tricksters that glide at his feet, 
And the hand of the lifeless scent lifted to blast 
The sycophants fawning round tyranny's seat ! 
Oh, place it not there, lest the light that is fled 
Should glitter an instant again in those eyes, 
And a 
curse seem to fall from the lips of the dead 
On the vileness that revels where liberty dies. 
Not there— in the heart of the passer below 
A spark might be lit front the patriot's shrine, 
And the charm of his presence enkindle the glow 
That ennobles the slave and makes manhood divine. 
Not there—for the lessons men draw from his grave 
Can no longer be taught in the land where he lies— 
Pis name must be barred to the lips of the slave, 
And his monument hid from his countrymen's eyes. 
Not there shall they build it! 
Some robber who sailed 
'Neath the banner of Britain thrice purpled in blood, 
Some cut-throat whom England as victor has hailed— 
Let his be the place of O'Brien the Good. 
The princes who scourged us with stripes and with chains, 
And those known alone for their greed and their lust, 
Mae fill each unoccupied site that remains, 
But no spot can be spared to O'Brien the Just. 
Yes, hide it away ; in some tenantless lane. 
Some bye-way surrounded by ruins and mud, 
Where the stranger, bewildered, may seek it in vain, 
Let the marble be raised to O'Brien the Good. 
Yes, hide it away—tor the prlde of his race, 
Their virtues and zeal were interred with his clay, 
And the sight of those features might startle the base, 
And crimson the cheeks of his country to-day. 
But hear it, ye false ones, the oath that goes round, 
Ere the hands that have pledged it shall wither to dust 
In the land that he loved shall a 
statue be crowned, 
By the hands of the tree to O'Brien the Just.

To speakthe malisou of heaven.

They would have pray 'd

But know that when its sheet unrolls, 
The weight of blood is on your souls.

The neo Ins on your hearth shall grow, 
Dead as the green oblivious flood 
That mantles by your walls, shall be 
Tito glory of O'Connor's blood. 
Away, away to A

Where, down ward when the sun shall fall, 
The raven's wing shall be your pall. 
And not a 
vassal shall unlace 
The vizor from your dying face.

A 
bolt that overhung our dome 
Suspended till my curse was given, 
Soon as it pass'd these lips of foam, 
Peal'd in the blood-red heaven. 
Dire was the look that o'er their backs 
The alle-ry parting brothers threw : 
But now, behold : like cataracts, 
Come down the hills in view

MAN'S MISSION. 
Human lives are silent teaching— 
Be they earnest, mild, and true— 
Noble deeds are noblest preaching 
From the consecrated few. • 
Poet-Priests their anthems singing, 
Hero swords on corslet ringing, 
When Truth's banner is unfurled 
Youthful preachers, genius-gifted, 
Pouring forth their souls uplifted, 
Till their preaching stirs the world. 
Each must work as God has given 
Hero hand and poet soul— 
Work is duty while we live in 
This weird world of sin and dole. 
Gentle spirits lowly kneeling, 
Lift their white hands up appealing 
To the Throne of Heaven s 
King— 
Strongest natures, cu'ininating, 
In great actions incarnating 
What another can but slug. 
Pure and meek- eyed as an angel. 
We must strive--must agonise; 
We' must preach the saint's evangel 
Ere we claim the saintly prize— 
Work for al— for work is holy— 
We fu'fil our mission solely 
When, like Heavan's arch above, 
Blend our souls in one emblazon, 
And the social diwason 
Sounds the perfect chord of love.

A PICTURE OF MUNSTER. 
Let the Pilgrim of Beauty roam on as he may, 
From the snows of the north to the regions of wine, 
What space can unfold in the light of the day, 
In glories more varied, sweet province, than thine? 
Where the sun that at morn scatters fire on the crest 
Of the giant-bro wed Gal tees, rounds southward, and takes 
A golden farewell ere he sinks to his nest 
In the arbutus bowers of the legended lakes. 
Hero grey castles moulder like dreams of the past. 
'Mid the sunshine of morn and the dews of the clime' 
Here round towers, haunted with shadows, still last 
On the evening inland, like dials of Time. 
Streams freshen the meadows by forests of green, 
By moss covered Abbeys, all ruined and bare, 
Whose lone chancel casements at twilight are seen 
Like skeleton bands pointed heavenward in prayer. 
Here rise the great hills from the pasturing plains— 
Here goldens the cornland by village and lea— • 
Here rolls the broad Shannon, enriched with the rains, 
By the turrets of Limerick, swift to the sea. 
Ah! once by those waters great argosies cast 
From their broad vans at sunset, a 
heroic :gloom: 
Ah! once by those mouldering battlements, past 
The dusky brewed Spaniard in armour and plume. 
The pageant is o'er, but the blood that enshades 
The peasant's rich cheek from that fountain is drawn, 
And glows in the dewy-dark eyes of her maids, 
Like the sunned Guadclquiver's first ripple at dawn. 
Here feasted the chiefs by the castles broad fire, 
And swelled the wild song of the wandering guest, 
'Till the memoried music be struck from his lyre, 
Stirred the sword in the scabbard, the heart in the breast. 
Here oft as the battle day gloomed o'er the flood, 
Their fierce cheers gave note of the enemy's flight, 
As t 
ey marched by the turrets of Desmond's wild wood, 
With their reddened spears raised in the evening light. 
But lo ! while we muse in the light of thy streams, 
That sparkle in fresh diamond dances anigh, 
The souls of thy clime, like a 
splendor in dreams, 
Descend in a 
radiant train from the sky. 
Floats up from the Shannon a 
shadowy blast, 
Were great Brian's Eincera lies ruined and lone,

A PICTURE OF PtIUNSTER.—[CoricLuDED. 
And a 
phantom looks down from the clouds of the past, 
And mournfully sighs on the years that aro gone. 
When discord lay dead as his steel-shining hand 
Waved the terror-struck fleets of the North-men away; 
When Peace crowned Victory shone in the land 
Like a 
warrior's plume on a 
mid-summer day. 
Rude years, but ennobled by battle and toil, 
Proud years, that still rise o'er the ages at rest, 
Like turrets that look o'er a 
fertilized soil, 
As they moulder in mist on the skirt of the west. 
And mark, after long barren ages of gloom, 
A new light burns broad on eternity's wing, 
And Grattan strides proud]y. by Liberty's tomb, 
With the tongue of a 
prophet, the brain of a

Great chieftain of Freedom, proud Erin's alone, 
Whose soul like a 
thunder-clond born in the blue, 
Could shake to its centre, the foreigner's throne, 
While it nurtured the sweet native green with its dew-. 
Who treads by his side o'er the purple belled heath, 
With wild scattered hair o'er that forehead so wan, 
Whence flashes the upturned eye from its sheath, 
With a 
glance like the brown-hooded falcon's at dawn 
Ah! rich native Fancy, thy flame never lit 
Such splendors as swarmed from our Curran' s 
blight brain— 
Scintiltant as spar, to the sparkle of wit, 
Yet soft as the blossom enriched with the rain. 
Orphan Isle of the Ocean ! Low bright is thy sway, 
Though sadly then sit'st by the western wave, 
When the song of thy Moore charms the world on its way, 
When the brain of thy Burke rules the age from Lis grave. 
Ah! when shall thy Genius arise with the power 
To guide thy old storms o'er a 
fertilized mould, 
Pile them high in the west in tranquility's hour, 
And magic their gloom to a`glory of gold. 
Despair not—though shadowed by memory long. 
Great spirits shall guard thee like planets aflame, 
And armored by heaven, prolific and strong, 
With the youth of eternity toil for thy fame: 
Yes, nurtured to life by the sun of thy clime, 
New heroes shall pace where thy Glories have trod, 
And Voices, yet hushed in the silence of Time, 
Roll up with thine old living echoes to God.

A NEW YEAR'S SONG... 
My countrymen. awake! arise! 
Our work begins anew. 
Your mingled voices rend the skies, 
Your.hearts are firm and true; 
You've bravely marched and nobly met 
Our little green isle through; 
But, oh! my friends, there's something yet 
For Irishmen to do! 
As long as Erin hears the clink 
Of base ignoble chains— 
As long as one detested link 
Of foreign rule remains— 
As long as of our rightful debt 
One smallest fraction's due, 
So long, my frierr7s, there's something yet 
For Irishmen to do! 
Ton long we've borne the servile yoke— 
Too long the slavish chain— 
Too long in feeble accents spoke, 
And ever spoke in vain— 
Our wealth has filled the spoiler's net, 
And gorg'd the Saxon crew; 
But eh! my friends, we'll teach them yet 
What Irishmen can do. 
The olive branch i in our bands, 
The white flag floats above; 
Peace —peace pervades our myriad bands, 
And proud forgiving love! 
But, oh, let not our foes forget 
We're men as Christians. too, 
Prepared to do for Ireland yet 
What Irishmen should do. 
There's not a 
man of all our land 
Our country now can spate, 
The strong man with his sinewy band, 
The weak man with his prayer. 
No whining tone of mere regret, 
Young Irish bards for y. n; 
But let your songs teach Ireland yet 
What Irishmen should do. 
And whereso'er that duty lead. 
There— there your post should be, 
The coward slave is never freed f 
The brave alone are free. 
Ob. Freedom. firmly fixed are set 
Our longing, eyes on you: 
And though we die for Trelanaa.et, 
So Irishmen stould do.

Ring it out from every steeple • 
Call the clans from every fold; 
We're a 
democratic people, 
And our faith we mean to hod. 
We're for mercy to the beaten foe, 
For brothers we have been; 
And what oppression is we know, 
All we who Wear the Green. 
Aye! what oppression is we know, 
All we woo Wear the G; een--
In our very hones what it is we know, 
We boys who Wear the Green! 
We have felt it in our Sireland, 
With its whip our backs are scored; 
Of the South we'll male ,no 
Scourged with famine and the sword. 
'Tis true they tried the rebel game 
But punished they have been ; 
And I 
rather think we've done the same, 
All we who Wear the Green. 
We ourselves have done the very same. 
All we who Wear the Green; 
And we hope again to do the same, 
We boys who Wear the Green! 
0, Manhood's proudest duty, 
Is to fight for Manhood's faith ; 
And true courage has a 
beauty. 
That not even crime can scathe. 
Into chaos they plunged headword, boys, 
Their guilt we do not screen; 
But our Emmet and Lord Edward. boys. 
Did likewise for the Green ! 
Aye! Hugh O'Neil and Owen Roe, 
Were rebels for the Green,— 
Wolfe Tone, and great Lord Edward, boys, 
Did likewise for the Green! 
And the day is not far distrait 
When our equal boast shill be ; 
That our country's crown is glistened 
With our Hancock, Grant and Lee. 
By Stonewall Jackson's front of flame, 
And Sherman swift and keen; 
And Meagher, 'who led on to fame 
Us boys who Wear the Green! 
Tom Meagher, whose brigade of fame 
All wore the plumes of Green, 
And Sheridan, -whose deathless name 
Proclaims he Wears the Green ! 
So " Mercy" be the countersign 
And " Union " the parole ; 
While the bugles ring along our line 
And the drums for battle roll. 
And the cry shall swell from every month 
And on our flags be seen ; 
" 
We're for mercy to the beaten South, 
We beaten of the Green."

OUR counsz. 
We look'd for guidance to the blind! 
We sued for counsel to the dumb,. 
Fling the vain fancy to the wind— 
Their hour is past, and ours is come; 
They gave, in that propitious hour, 
Nor kindly look, nor gracious tone, 
But heaven has not denied us power, 
To uo their duty and our own. 
ANI is it true, that tyrants throw 
Their shafts among us, steeped in gall; 
And every arrow, swift or slow, 
Points foremost still, ascent or fall— 
Still sure to wound us, tho' the aim 
Seem ta'en remotely. or amiss ? 
And men with spirits feel no shame 
To brook so dark a 
doom as this. 
Alas I 
the nobles of the land, 
Are like our long-deserted halls, 
No living voices, clear and grand, 
ReQpond when foe or freedom calls ; 
But ever and anon ascends. 
Low moaning, when the tempest rolls; 
A tone, that desolation lends, 
Some crevice of their ruined souls. 
So be it—yet shall we prolong, 
Our prayers, when deeds would serve our need ; 
Or wait for woes, the swift and strong, 
Can ward by strength or 'scope by speed, 
The vilest of the vile ot earth, 
Were nobler than our proud array, 
If, suffering bondage from our birth, 
We will not burst it Ivheu we may. 
And has the bondage not been borne 
Till all our softer nature fled— 
Till tryanny's dark tide had worn, 
Down to the stubborn rock its bed,

But if the current cold and deep, 
That channel through all time retain, 
At worst, by heaven I 
it shall not sweep, 
Uhruffled o'er our hearts again. 
Up tor the land—'tis ours—'tis ours— 
The proud man's sympathies are all. 
Like silvery clouds, whose faithless showers, 
Come froz'n to hailstones in their tall. 
Out freedom and the sea- bird's food, 
Are hid beneath deep ocean waves, 
And who should search and sound the flood, 
If not the sea-birds and the slaves ? 
In Ireland so frisky, with sweet girls and whisky, 
We managed to keep care and sorrow aloof; 
Our whirling revels made all the blue devils 
Creep out with the smoke through a 
hole in the roof. 
But well I 
remember, one foggy November, 
My mother cried. Go make your fortune, my lad; 
Go bother time ninnies clean out of their guineas, 
Away then I 
scampered from Ballinatad. 
Then to seek for promotion, I 
walk'd the wide ocean, 
Was shipwreck'd, and murder'd and sold for a 
slave, 
Over mountains and rivers, was peltel to shivers, 
And met on dry land with a 
watery grave. 
But now Mr. Jew-man, has made matte me a 
new-man 
And whisky and Mammora make my heart glad, 
To the sweet flowing Litley I'm off in a 
jiffey, 
With a 
witack tor old Ireland, and Badinalad. 
From this cursed station to that blessed nation, 
Again Mr. Rooney- shall visit your shore. 
Where I'll flourish so gaily my ! Trig of shilletah ; 
Long life to old 
adab of Great Mogadore, 
Oh then all my cousins will run out by dozens, 
And out too will hobble old mammy and dad, 
At dinner they'll treat us with mealy potatoes, 
And whiskey distill'd at sweet Ilallinafad.

Oh! give me back that royal dream, 
My fancy Nvrought, 
When I 
have seen your sunny eyes 
Grow moist with thought ; 
And fondly hop'd, dear love, your heart from mine 
Its spell had caught ; 
And laid me down to dream that dream divine. 
But true, methought, 
Of bow my lite's long task would be, to make yours bless-
ed as it ought. 
For your sweet sake, 
To watch with you—dear friend, with you !— 
Its wonders break ; 
The sparkling Spring in that bright face to see 
its mirror make— 
On summer morns to hear the sweet birds sing 
By thin and lake! 
And know your voice, your magic voice, could still a 
grander music wake I 
On some old shell strewn rock to sit, 
In Autumn eves, 
Where grey Killiney cools the torrid air, 
hot autumn weaves ; 
Or by that Holy Well in mountain lone 
Where faith believes 
(Fain would I 
b'lieve) its secret, darling, wish 
True love achieves, 
Yet, oh! its Saint was not more pure than she to whom 
my fond heart cleaves. 
To see the dark mid-winter night 
Pass like a 
noon, 
Sultry with thought from minds that teemed, 
And glowed like June; 
Whereto would pass in settlp'd and pictured train 
Art's magic boon; 
And music thrill with many a 
haughty strain, 
And dear old tune, 
Till hearts grew sad to hear the destined hour to part had 
come so soon.

But my best chosen friend, companiou, guide, 
To walk through life, 
Link'd hand in hand, two equal, loving friends, true hus-
band and true wife. 
[21 
By JAMES OUR. 
A. United Irishman of 1798, and fought at Antrim. 
An :—" Vire Ia." 
The savage loves his native shore, 
Though rude the soil and chill the air; 
Then well may Erin's sous adore 
Their isle which nature formed so fair. 
What flood reflects a 
shore so sweet 
As Shannon great, or pastoral Bann 
Or who a 
friend or foe can meet 
So generous as an Irishman! 
His hand is rash, his heart is warm, 
But honesty is still his guide; 
None more repents a 
deed of harm, , 
And none forgives with nobler pride. 
He may be duped, but won't be dared— 
More fit to practise than to plan ; 
He dearly earns his poor reward, 
And spends it like an Irishman. 
If strange or poor, for you he'll pay. 
And gnide to where you safe may be; 
If you're his guest, while e'er you stay, 
His cottage 'holds a 
jubilee. 
His inmost soul he will unlock, 
And if he may your secrets scan. 
Your confidence he scorns to mock, 
For faithful is an Irishman. 
By honor bound in woe or weal, 
Whate'er she bids, lie dares to do; 
Try him with bribes,— they won't prevail; 
Prove him in fire— you'll find him true. 
He seeks not safety, let his post 
Be where it ought in , anger's van; 
And if the field of f 
me be lost, 
It won't be by an Irishman. 
El in ! loved land I 
from age to age, 
Be thou more great, more famed, and free; 
May peace be thine, or. shouldst thou wage 
Defensive war—cheap victory. 
May plenty bloom in every field, 
Which gentle breezes softly fan, 
And cheerful smiles serenely gild 
The home of every Irishman 
THE IRISH WIFE. 
By T. D. X'GEE. 
[al 1370, the statute of Kilkenny forbade English set-
tlers in Ireland to intermarry with the old Irish. James, 
Earl ot Desmond, was the first to violate this law.1 
I 
would not give my Irish wife 
For all the dames of the Saxon land— 
I 
would not, give my Irish wile 
For the Q 
tee .t ot France's hand. 
For she to me is dearer 
Than castles strong, or hinds, or life— 
An outlaw—so l 
m near her, 
To love Liii death my ii ish wile. 
OM what would be this home of' mine— 
A ruined, her 
place, 
But for the light that nightly shines, 
Upon its ‘vall from 
Kathleen's face ? 
What comfort in a 
mine of gold— 
What pleasure in a 
royal life, 
It the heart within lay dead and cold, 
If I 
could not wed my Irish wile? 
I 
knew the law forbade the banns— 
I 
knew : sty King abhorred her race— 
Who never bent before their clans, 
Must bow before their ladies' grace. 
Take all my forfeited domain, 
cannot wage with kinsmen strife— 
Take knightly gear, and noble name, 
And I 
will keep my Irish wile. 
My Irish wife has clear blue eyes, 
My heaven '
by day, may stars by night. 
And t‘vinlike truth and fondness lie 
\Violin her swelling bosom white. 
My Irish win; has golden hair— 
Apollo's harp hail once such strings— 
Apollo's self might pause to hear 
lice bird-like carol when she sings. 
I 
would not give my Irish wife 
For all the dames of the Saxon land--
I 
would not give me Irish wife 
For the Queen of France's hand. 
For she to me is dearer 
Than castles strong, or lands, °Hite— 
In death I 
would be near her, 
And rise beside my Irish wife!

KATHLEEN BAN ADAIR. 
By FRANCIS DAVIS. 
The battle blood of Antrim had not dried on freedom's 
shroud. 
And the rosy ray of morning was but struggling thro' the 
cloud; 
When, \Nit 
lightning foot and deathly cheek, and wildly 
waving hair, 
O'er grass and dew, scarce breathing, flew young Kath-
leen ban Adair. 
Behind. her native Antrim in a 
reeking ruin lies, 
Before her, like a 
silvery path, Kells's sleeping waters rise ; 
And many a 
pointed shrub has piere'd those feet so white 
and bare. 
..But, oh 
thy heart is deeper rent, young Kathleen ban 
Adair. 
And Kathleen's heart but one week since was like a 
har-
vest. morn. 
When hope :mil joy are kneeling round the sheaf of yel-
low corn ; 
But where's ttie bloom then made her cheek so ripe, so 
richly fair. 
Thy stricken heart bath fed on it, young Kathleen ban 
Adair. 
And now she gains a 
thicket, where the sloe and hazel rise, 
But Xvity those shrieking Nvhispers, like a 
rush of worded 
sigl ? 
Alt ! low and lonely bleeding lies a 
wounded patriot there, 
And every pang of his is thine, young Kathleen ban Adair. 
" 
I 
see them, oh I 
I 
see them, in their fearful red array, 
The yoemen, love I 
the yeomen come—all! heavens away. 
away ! 
I 
know, I 
know they mean to track my lion to his lair; 
Alt ! save thy lite—ail! save it for t!.y Kathleen ban Adair. 
" 
May Heaven shield thee, Kathleen !— when my soul has 
gone to rest; 
May comfort rear her temple in thy pure and faithful 
breast ; 
But to fly them, oh ! to fly them, like a 
bleeding hunted 
hare, 
No! not to purchase heaven, with my Kathleen ban Adair.

' 
I 
loved, I 
love thee, Kathleen, in my bosom's warmest

And Erin, injured Erin, oh! I 
loved thee even more; 
And death, I 
feared him little When I drove him through 
their square, 
Nor now, though eating at my heart, my Kathleen ban 
Adair." 
With feeble hand his blade he grasp'd, yet dark with 
spoiler's blood, 
And them, as though with dying bound, once more erect 
lie stood ; 
But scarcely had he kiss'd that cheek so pale, so purely 
fair, 
When flashed their bayonets round hint and his Kathleen 
ban Adair. 
Then up arose his trembling, yet his dreaded hero's hand, 
And up arose, in struggling sounds, his cheer for mother 
land ; 
A thrust—a 
rush—their foremost falls ; but alt ! good God ! 
see there, 
Thy lovel's quivering at thy feet, young Kathleen ban 
Adair. 
But heavens ! men, what reeked he then your heartless, 
taunts and blo WS, 
When from his lacerated heart ten dripping bayonets rose, 
And maiden, thou with frantic hands, what boots it kneel-
ing there? 
The ivinds heed not thy yellow locks, young Kathleen ban 
Adair. 
Oh ! what were tears, or shrieks, or swoons but shadows 
of the rest, 
When torn tvas frantic Kathleen from the slaughtered 
hero's breast, 
And hardly had his last-heaved sigh grown cold upon the 
air, 
When oh ! of all but kite they robb'd young Kathleen ban

But whither now shall Kathleen fly ?— already is she gone, 
Thy ‘vater, Kells, is tempting tair, and thither speeds she 
on; 
A moment on its blooming banks she kneels in hurried 
prayer— 
Now in its wave site finds a 
grave. poor Kathleen ban

[Dr. Drennan, the author of this ballad, was one of 
the ablest writers among the United Irishmen. 
His 
SO) gs and ballads were elliefly directed to enlist Ulster 
iii " 
the Union." His song named " Erin," which fixed 
upon Ireland the title of `• the Emerald Isle," Moore 
esteems among the 1110St perfect of modern songs.] 
Here our murdered brother lies; 
Wake -him not with women's cries; 
Mourn the way that manhood ought ; 
Sit in silent trance of thought. 
Write his merits on your mind ; 
Morals pure and manners kind; 
In his head as on a 
hill, 
Virtue plac'd her citadel. 
Why cut off in palmy youth? 
Truth he spoke, and acted truth. 
Countrymen. UNITE., he cried, 
And died— for what his Savior died. 
God of Peace, and Goa of Love, 
Let it not thy vengeance move, 
Let it not thy lightnings draw ; 
A nation guillotin'd by law. 
Hapless nation ! rent and torn, 
Thou went early taught to mourn.

Hunted thro' thy native grounds, 
Or flung reward to human hounds; 
Each one pull'd and tore his share, 
Heedless of thy deep despair. 
Hapless Nation—hapless Land, 
Heap of uncementing sand 
Crumbled by a 
foreign weight; 
And by worse, domestic hate. 
God of mercy! God of peace! 
Make the mad confusion cease; 
O'er the mental chaos move, 
Through it SPEAK the light of love. 
Monstrous and unhappy sight! 
Brothers' blood will not unite; 
Holy oil and holy water, 
Mix, and fill the world with slaughter. 
Who is she with aspect wild? 
The widow'd mother with her child; 
Child new stirring in the womb ! 
Husband waiting for the tomb! 
Angel of this sacred place. 
Calm her soul and whisper peace, 
Cord, or axe, or guillotin' 
Make the sentence— not the sin. 
Here we watch our brother's sleep ; 
Watch with us, but do not weep; 
Watch with us thro' dead of night, 
But expect the morning light.

SQUARE-TOED BOOTS. 
By T. D. Sucuves. 
Ala:—" King O'Toole." 
Says Johnny Bull to Larcom, " Oh, tell my dear police 
To watch those wicked foreigners who much disturb my peace, 
Who come across the ocean on no manifest pursuits, 
And who swagger down my thoroughfares in square- toed bcots. 
Their bats caved in and shapeless, to slight the crown are meant 
Their knickerbocks and gaiters show atlesperate intent; 
Their beards look all seditious, from the tips unto the roots, 
But there's mischief-beyond measure in their square-toed booth. 
" 
When met by sub-inspectors, high sheriffs, or J'. P.'S, 
There's something quite defiant in the wag of their goatees; 
They never bow submissively; they dream of no salutes, 
Save what's hinted in the action of their square- toed boots. 
"But now, no more these rovers shall fright rue and annoy— 
I'll treat then, to the beauties of Kilmainham and Motintjoy ; 
For I've made this resolution, whatever be its fruits, 
That my laws shall not be trampled on with square-toed booth." 
From Larcom to the Royals the word was sent around, 
And fast they seized Americans where'er they could be found; 
They dragged them off to prison, and they treated them like brutes, 
On a 
charge of foul conspiracy, and square-toed boots. 
But now the news has traveled afar across the sea, 
01(1 Uncle Sam has heard it, and a 
mighty man is he; 
Through all his huge anatomy a 
thrill of anger shoots, 
And like thunder comes the stamping of his square-toed booth. 
And Johnny Bull grows fearful, as surely well he may, 
When up that giant rises, and strides across his way ; 
For past experience whispers, what no later fact refutes, 
That there's terrible propulsion in his square- toed boots. 
Am I 
the slave they say, 
Soggarth aroon, 
Since you did show the way, 
Soggarth aroon. 
Their slave no more to be 
While they would work with me 
OuId Ireland's slavery, 
Soggarth aroon ? 
Why not her poorest man, 
Soggarth aroon, 
Try and do all he can, 
Soggarth aroon, 
Her commands to fulfil, 
Of his own heart and will, 
Side by side with you stil, 
Soggarth aroon ? 
Loyal and brave to you, 
Soggarth aroon, 
Yet be no slave to you, 
Soggarth aroon— 
Nor, out of fear to you, 
Stand up so near to you— 
Och ! out of fear to you! 
Soggarth anon. 
Who in the winter's night, 
Soggarth aroon, 
When the sold blast did bite, 
Soggarth aroon. 
Came to my cabin-door, 
And, on my earthen-floor, 
Knelt by me sick and poor, 
Soggarth aroon ? 
Who on the marriage-day, 
Soggarth  
aroon, 
Made the poor cabin gay, 
Soggarth aroon— 
And did both laugh and sing, 
Making onr hearts to ring, 
At the poor christening, 
Soggarth aroon. 
Who as friend only met, 
Soggarth aroon, 
Never did flout me yet, 
Soggarth aroon ? 
And when my heart was dim 
Gave, while his eye did brim, 
What I 
should give to him, 
Soggarth aroon ? 
Och I 
you, and only you, 
Soggarth aroon 
And for this I 
was true to you 
Soggarth aroon; 
In love they'll never shake, 
When for ould Ireland's sake 
We a 
true part did take,

UNDER THE GREEN FLAG. 
By T. D. SULLIVAN. 
Come, stand beneath the Green, boys, 
Our ancient Irish Green, 
That would not fade; 
The truest shade 
The earth has ever seen. 
At Mother Erin's call. boys, 
Dear Mother Erin's call, 
Come, let its stand 
With sword in hand 
Beside her, one and all. 
Fill up those ranks anew. boys, 
Those shattered ranks anew, 
For artful knaves 
And sordid slaves 
Have left them but a 
few. 
But Erin dear has still, boys, 
Our Erin dear has still 
A gallant host 
From coast to coast, 
On valley, plain, and hill. 
Yes, and beyond them too, boys, 
And far beyond them, too, 
Her pure blood runs 
In loving sons 
Prepared her work to do. 
And now, from pole to pole, boys, 
From further pole to pole, 
Some subtle wire 
Conveys the fire 
That kindles in her soul. 
We'll bid that flame arise, boys, 
That sacred flame arise ; 
The time is near, 
The signs are clear. 
On earth and in the skies. 
Whate'er our fate may be, boys, 
Whate'er our fate may be, 
Well act our parts, 
We'll nerve our hearts, 
And die, or set her free. 
Then stand beneath the Green, boys, 
Arrayed beneath the Green, 
No flag unfurled 
Through all the world 
Is loved as that has been. 
'Twas borne through the past, boys, 
The wild, the stormy past; 
For every thread 
A hero bled— 
'Twill triumph at the last.

THE GREEN AND THE GOLD. 
By Du. R. D. JOYCE. 
Ant :—" Neil McCreaman was a 
brew Hieland Soldier." 
In the soft blooming vales of oar country, 
Two colors shine brightest of all, 
Oct mountain, and meorland, and meadow, 
On cottage :Led old castle wall; 
They shine in the gay summer garden, 
Anti glint in the depths of the weld. 
And they gleam on the banner of Ireland. 
Our colots ! the Green and the Gold! 
Then hurrah, for the Green and the Gold! 
By the fresh winds ef Freedom out-rolled, 
As they shin'e on the brave Irish banner, 
Our colors! the Green and the Gold! 
In the days of Fomorian and Fenian, 
These colors flashed bright in the ray; 
And their gleam kept the tierce Roman eagles 
In Rome conquered Britain at bay, 
When Conn forgot his hundred red battles, 
And the lightning struck Daithi of old. 
As lie bore through Helvetia's wild gorges 
Our colors ! the Green and the Gold! 
Then hurrah, for the Green and the Gold! 
May they flourish for ages untold. 
May they blaze in the vanguard of freedom, 
Our colors! the Green and the Gold ! 
Up many a 
grim breach of glory, 
In many a 
fierce battle's tide, 
Flashing high o'er the red gleaming surges, 
Our banners swept on in their pride. 
From the day when triumphant they fluttered 
O'er the legions of Brian the Bold ; 
Till with Sarsfield they streamed down the Shannon, 
Our colors! the Green and the Gold! 
The' hurrah, for the Green and the Gold! 
In victory's van as of old 
May they flash over new Fenian legions, 
Our colors! the Green and the Geld! 
In these dark days of deem and disaster, 
Is it dead the old love for our land, 
Are our bosoms less brave than our fathers', 
Comes the sword- hilt less (left to our hand I 
No, we've proved its the wide world over 
Wherever war's surges have rolled, 
And will raise once ae-ain in Old Ireland, 
Our colors! the Green and the Gold! 
Then hurrah for the Green and the Gold! 
And hurrah for the valliant and hold 
Who will raise them supreme in old Ireland, 
Our colors! the Green and the Gold! 
THE BARDS. 
Oh, for the Bards, the glorious Bards, the pride of the 
days of old, 
When the honour'd claim of 
manly name was not found-
ed on the servile gold ; 
When the chiefs of our land with chivalrous band gave 
Genius a 
regal crown, 
While the soulless knave to a 
nameless grave like a 
grove-
ling worm went down. 
When with godlike might 
Worth, fame, and right 
Were defended by steel-nerved men ; 
0 God of the Free, 
It was grand to see 
The pomp of our country then. 
Here's to the Bards, the brave old Bards, who kindled the 
martial fire, 
In Chief and Prince with the eloquence and magic op 
harp anti Tyre ; 
When the soul of the proud like a 
lightning cloud flamed 
up at the thrill of song, 
And leapt to the fight with a 
fierce delight to avenge an 
unmanly wrong. 
For the brave Bards gave, 
Like a 
mountain wave, 
A sweep to the Nvarrior's brand, 
And fired hint to show, 
The mark of his blow, 
When a 
tyrant was in the land. 
The Norman Lords, with their valorous swords to our Isle 
as Invaders came, 
But soon they grew to that land more true than the Irish 
in birth and name ; 
For our Island song, with a 
witchery strong on their 
souls threw an Irish spell, 
And their brave hearts felt the fire of the Celt, and they 
show'd they lov'd Erin well. 
But gone are the Bards, 
And the warrior lords, 
The pride of the thIle3 of yore; 
And a 
bloodless race 
has taken their place, 
Where fremcn are seen no more. 
0 ! splendid days when love and praise were the meed of 
the bold and true— 
When hands were strong to resent a 
wrong, and traitors 
and knaves were few ; 
When no hireling spy dared come to pry round the homes 
of the wiling poor, 
For our Princes ruled with a rod of gold, in 
pe.,ple's love secure. 
And time halls of the peer, 
Shook with roaring cheer. 
And the traveller was welcomed in! 
0 God of the brave! 
It was grand to live, 
In the Kingdom of Edit then. 
their 
Then here's to the Bards, the proud old Bards, that hurled 
our clans to light, 
Like the headlong dash of a thunder-crash, 'gainst a 
foreign invaders might ; 
When our chieftains broke from Henry's yoke, what 
sharpen'd their battle swords, 
ro strike for their right with courage and might ?—' twas 
the songs of our brave old Bards. 
High souls of song! 
Stern foes of wrong, 
Since perished our order grand, 
The lions are dead, 
The eagles have lied, 
And jackals have curst the land.

Since the days of Trojan Paris 
When beauteous lielen was the toast, 
O'er lords and mighty monarchs

And why should clippies hang behind 
In gallantry such men of note? 
On Irish ground, in Irish wind 
We spread our flag—a 
Petticoat ! 
For we were croppy heroes 
With pike in hand. and flog afloat, 
Who fought and bled lot fri•e/!om 
Beneath that flag— the Pekticoat I 
This Petticoat was broidered 
By lingers fair as lair could be, 
And once its folds fell over 
A gleaming allele gracefully. 
A milk-white foot that stept tIe glades 
As light as fairies of the moat,— 
Young Nora's, pride of Wexford milids, 
This I 
yrant-conquering Petticoat ! 
And we were choppy heroes 
With pike in hand, and flag :' float, 
With stains of blood upon it— 
This flag— the conquering Petticoat I' 
'Twas on a 
summer morning 
As we marched down the dewy hill, 
We found our briolit-eyed Nora 
Upon the way-side stark and still. 
A yeoman's bullet in Iter breast., 
.A sabre wound across her throaI— 
'Twas then we made with vengeful zest 
Our banner of her Petticoat 
For we were croppy herous 
With pike in hand, and flog afloat, 
Determined to avenge her 
Beneath that flog— the Petticoat !

And though with fire each dream be fraught 
Across those bright eyes stealing— 
That heart is true, those thoughts are bold; 
And bold each feeling sweepeth. 
There lies not there a 
bosom cold, 
A pulse that faintly sleepeth. 
Ills dreams are idiot-dreams, ye say, 
The dreams of fairy story ; 
Those dreams will burn in might one day 
And flood his path with glory ! 
Thou old dull vassal ! fling thy sneer 
Upon that young heart coldly. 
And laugh at deeds thy heart. may fear, 
Yet he will venture boldly. 
Ay. fling thy sneer, while dull and slow 
Thy withered blood is creeping; 
That heart will beat; that spirit glow, 
When thy tame pulse is sleeping. 
Ay, laugh, when o'er his country's ills 
Wifh manly eye he weepeth ; 
Laugh, when his brave heart horbs and thrills, 
And thy cold bosom sleepeth. 
Laugh when he vows in heaven's sight, 
Ne'er to flinch—ne'er to falter ; 
To toil and fight for a 
nation's right. 
And guard old Freedom's altar. 
Ay, laugh when on the fiery wing 
Of hero thought ascending, 
To fame's bold cliff, with eagle spring 
That young bright mind is tending. 
He'll gain that cliff, he'll reach that throne, 
The throne where genius shined), 
When round and through thy nameless stone, 
The green weed thickly twineth.

BOOKER'S RUN. 
By 
T. 
D. 
SULLIVAN. 
AIR :
—" 
The King of the Cannibal Islands." 
Oh, list and hear, good friends, from me, 
The news that's just come o'er the sea, 
About the light-legged company 
Led on by Colonel Booker, 
The " Queen's Own Regiment" was their name; 
From fair Toronto town they came, 
To put the Irish all to shame, 
And win themselves immortal fame, 
Tantora, rubadub, oh, hi-ho 
Drums beat up and bugles blow, 
011 they march to meet the foe, 
The Queen's and Colonel Booker, 
Such fury filled each loyal mind, 
No Volunteer would stay behind ; 
They flung their red flag to the wind. 
" 
Harm, my boys," said Booker, 
"Behold, beyond you sloping heights, 
Their bayonets flashing in the light; 
Go forth, my heroes, left and right, 
Let none among them live to night— 
Readily, steadily, oh, hi-ho, 
Sure your aim, and strong your blow, 
No Irish ruck could face, you know, 
The Queen's and Colonel Booker." 
The rifles flashed, the balls came by, 
The Queen's men fell with groan and cry— 
"Good Lord, I'd give the world that I 
Were safe at home," said Booker. 
He spurred for shelter here and there, 
He wheeled and cantered to the rear, 
BOOKER'S RUN. [CONCLUDED. 
'While every loyal Volunteer 
Was shaking in his boots with fear. 
Quailing, tailing. oh. hi- ho, 
Afraid to lace the Iri.sh foe, 
Who cheered and laughed to see the show, 
The Queen's and Colonel Booker. 
"What sound is that comes o'er the breeze ? 
Are those their horsemen midst the trees? 
Down, soldiers, down upon your knees 
To meet their charge," said Booker. 
Then turning quick, he left the place, 
lie wished, he said, to " change his base;" 
His soldiers joined him in the race, 
And all went off at railroad pace ; 
Helter-skelter, oh, hi-ho, 
Higgledly, piggledy, there they go, 
Swords and guns away they throw, 
The Queen's and Colonel Booker. 
Oh, never say the Indian breed 
Bear off the palm for wind and speed; 
What dusky chief could take a 
lead 
From loval Colonel Booker ? 
Bid him bring out, by day or night, 
His gallant 
Queen's" equipped for fight, 
Place Colonel John O'Neill in sight 
Amidst a 
ridge of bayonets bright— 
Then give the word. and oh, hi-ho, 
See how they hi fly the Irish foe, 
See how they'll ply the heel and toe, 
The Queen's and Colonel Booker.

WHY WE WEAR, THE GREEN. 
By J. A. JOYCE. 
Anti—" Wearing of the Green." 
When God raised up our Island, 
'Mid the billows of the West; 
And with vale, and stream, and highland, 
Made beautiful her breast. 
The smiling sun flung rotund her 
A robe of golden sheen ; 
And the misty west wind crowed her 
With a 
garland over Green. 
Soon the Gaelic 7;arrior galleys 
Sailed to the shining shore ; 
And bravo men and beauteous women 
Came to dwell forever more. 
And their sacrificial fit es 
On their altars high were seen ; 
When the sun Lnd winds they worshipped 
For their glorious gift of Green. 
But the Pagan fires faded, 
And the Druid altars fell ; 
When Patrick came, with glowing words, 
His nobler truths to tell. 
•' in the Shamrock, lo ! the emblem 
Of the Dinity is seen"— 
'Twas thus he consecrated hero 
The Wearing of the Green. 
And the nation's heart leaped to it, 
And thence for evermore ; 
On their breasts and in their banners, 
The flashing tint they bore. 
On their breasts and in their banners 
The gleamiog hue was seen; 
And tit° proudest foes went down before 
The men who bore the Green. 
So we wear it, and will wear it. 
In memory of the brave— 
The trite and tried, who strove and died 
Our nation's riahts to save: 
Of those who nobly chei islied it, 
When smote oppression keen ; 
Of those w ,•0 pine in prison 
For the love I 
hcv lo-ae the Green. 
[Edward Lysaght was born in Brichhill, County Clare. 
He 
entered Irini!y College in 17.9, and was subsequently called to 
the Bar. 
He was generally known as" pleasant Ned Lvsaght," 
and, to use the words of Sir Jonah Barringtoti, " considered law 
as his trade. and conviviality his profession." 
Ile wrote some 
good national songs, Ivhich, owing to his having obtained a 
government pace, were omitted from his published collection. 
The following song was written against the Union ] 
How 
justly alarmed is each Dublin cit, 
That he'll soon be transformed to a 
clown, sir, 
By a 
magical move of that conjurer, Pitt, 
The country is coming to town, sir I 
CHORUS. 
Give Pitt, and Dundas, and Jenky a 
glass, 
Who'd ride on John Bull, and make Paddy an Ass, 
Thro Capel street soon as you'll rurally range, 
You'll scarce recognize it the same street; 
Choice turnips shall grow in your Royal Exchange, 
Fine cabbages down along Dame street. 
Give Pitt, &c. 
Wild oats in the College won't want to be ; 
And hemp in the Four Courts may thrive, sir ! 
[II 
A PROSPECT.—[CONCLUDED. 
Your markets again shall with muttons be fill'd— 
By St. Patrick, they'll graze there alive, sir ! 
Give Pitt, Ste. 
In the Parliament House, quite alive, shall there be 
All the vermin the island e'er gathers; 
Full of rooks, as before, Daly's club-house you'll see, 
But the pigeons won't have any leathers. 
Give Pitt, &c. 
Our Custom-house quay,Aull of weeds, oh. rate sport, 
But the ministers' minions, kind elves. sir 1 
Will give us free leave all our goods to export, 
When we've got none at home for ourselves, sir ! 
Give Pitt, &-c. 
Says an alderman—" Corn will grow in your shops; 
This Union must work your enslavement." 
"That's true," says the sheriff, " for plenty of crops* 
Already I've seen on the pavement." 
Give Pitt, 65c. 
Ye brave loyal yeoman, dressed gaily in red, 
This minist er's plan must elate us ; 
And \veil may John Bull, when he's robb'd us of bread 
Call poor Ireland " The land of Potatoes." 
Give Pitt, & c. 
*A term used for the rebels in 1798, who wore their hair cut close.

Deep in Canadian woods we've met, 
From one bright island flown ; 
Great is the hind we tread, but yet 
Our hearts are with our own. 
And ere we leave this shanty small, 
While fades the autumn day, 
toaSt old Ireland! 
Dear old Ireland ! 
Ireland, boys, hurrah! 
We've heard her faults a 
hundred times 
The new ones and the old, 
In songs and sermons,kants and rhymes, 
Enlarged some fifty told. 
But take them all, the great and small, 
And this we've got to say :—

To snap her rusty ehai ,

How far they've won their way—

We've seen the wedding and the wake, 
The patron and the lair ;

And the heads they break down there, 
With a

And a 
thundering " clear the way I '—

From their peaceful homes, for miles

When Sunday morning smiles ! 
And deep the zeal their true hearts feel 
When low they kneel and pray.

AIR:—" The wearing of the Green." 
Young America and his Irish. Father. 
" 
0 ! father, dear, I've often heard you speak of Erin's Isle— 
Its scenes how bright and beautiful, bow " rich and rare" 
they smile; 
You say it is a 
lovely land in which a 
Prince might dwell, 
Then why did you abandon it, the reason to me tell ?" 
" 
My Son, I've loved my native land with fervor and with 
pride— 
Her peace I 
ul groves, her mountains rude, her valleys green 
and wide, 
And there rye roamed in manhood's prime, and sported 
when a 
boy, 
My Shamrock and shillelagh sure my constant boast and 
joy. 
" 
But lo! a 
blight came o'er my crops, my sheep and 
cattle died, 
The rack-rent too, alas ! was due, I 
could not have supplied ; 
The landlord drove me from the cot where born I 
had 
been, 
And that, my boy's the reason why I 
left old Skibbereen.—

what a 
dreadful sight it was that dark Novembet 
day; 
The Sheriff and the Peelers came to send us all away; 
They set the roof a-blazing with a 
demon smile of spleen, 
And when it fell, the crash was heard all over Skibbereen. 
"Your Mother dear, God rest her, fell upon the snowy 
ground, 
She fainted in her anguish at the desolation round ;— 
She never rose, but passed away from life's tumultuous 
scene, 
And found a 
quiet grave to rest in poor old Skibbereen. 
"Au ! sadly I 
recall that year of gloomy ; 
I 
rose in vengeance with " the boys" to battle against fate ; 
We were hunted thro' the mountains wild, as traitors to 
the Queen,— 
And that, my boy's the reason why I 
left old Skibbereen. 
"You then were only two years old, and feeble was your 
frame, 
I would not leave you with my friends—you bore my 
lather's name !— 
I 
wrapped you in my " Catainorel at dead of night unseen, 
Then heav'd a 
sigh, and bade good-by to poor old Skibbe-
reen."
