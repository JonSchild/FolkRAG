TO Tfit PUBLIC, 
MISS ALECIA JOURDAN is the youngest performer in her line 
now before the public, and she has, by strict attention to her 
business, accomplished wonders in improvement, gradually 
working her way up the ladder of fame until she has gained the 
summit, and now stands the Queen of all Protean _Artists. 
Her 
songs are all entirely new, most of them written expressly for 
and sung only by her. 
Her latest original sensation is inchanging 
from female to male character— the quickest change ever accom-
plished by a 
lady. 
So rapid is this almost incredible transform-
ation, that the audience_ are spell- bound and hardly believe 
their own eyes. 
The male changes too are marvellous, and the most complete 
ever made by any change artist—man or woman— changing 
hat, collar, necktie, vest, pants, shoes and gloves. 
She is undoubt-
edly the Premier Star of all lady vocalists and commands a 
higher 
salary than any other in her line.

Opinion 
S of the PPCS 
tz'„S 
MISS ALECIA JOURDAN is undoubtedly the Queen in her line. 
Nature has endowed her with its rarest giftS—beauty, voice, 
form and talent. 
Her songs are all new and first-class, not 
of a 
trashy sort, such as we hear in entertainments of this kind, 
but full of good ideas, and entertaining throughout. 
She is 
the authoress of most of them, we believe, which adds another 
wreath of talent to her bounteous store. — 
New Orleans Picayune. 
Miss Jourdan has a 
Shakespearian idea of her business— 
" 
suits the action to the word, the word to the action." 
her 
changes are the quickest we ever witnessed, and we could 
hardly realize it was the same party who stood before us, 
She 
is a 
great card. — Atlanta Herald. 
THE card of the evening was Miss Alecia Jourdan, and the 
entertainment she gave was a 
treat not to be f 
rgotten. 
Her 
lightning changes were inimitable, her songs all new — at least 
to us—and her wardrobe 'fell, ct-fitting and elegant to perfec-
tion. 
She is the best cat d 
we ever saw at this theatre during 
our experience of seventeen ears,—Savannah, (Ga.) News. 
A 
YOUNG lady, called on the programme Miss Alecia Jourdan, 
next presented herself for plflic favor, and was instantly recog-
nized as a 
songstress of undoubted ability in character changes 
She is young, pretty, a 
good figure and decidedly original.—

Chestnut Street, Philadelphia. 
Price 40 cents. 
I 
would ask of you, my darling, 
A 
question. soft and low, 
That gives me many a 
heart- ache, 
As the moments come and go. 
Your love I 
know is truthful, 
But the truest love grows cold 
It is this that I 
would ask you,— 
Will you love me when I'm old? 
It is this that I 
would ask you,— 
Will you love mo when I'm old. 
CHORUS. 
Life's morn will soon be waning, 
And its ev'nings bell. ba toll'd• 
Life's morn will soon be waning, 
And its ev'nings bells be toll'd; 
But my heart will know no sadness, 
if you'll love me when I'm old. 
But my heart will know no sadness, 
If you'll love me when I'm old? 
Down the stream of time togetner, 
-We are sailing side by side; 
Hoping some bright day to anchor, 
Safe beyond the surging tide, 
6 
'To-day our sky is cloudless, 
But the night may clouds unfold; 
And its storms may gather round us,— 
Will you love me when I'm old? 
And its storms may gather round us,— 
Will you love we when I'm old? 
Life's morn, &c. 
When my hair shall shame the snow-drift, 
And mine eyes shall dimmer grow; 
I 
would lean upon some loved one. 
In the valley as I 
go. 
I 
would claim of you a 
promise, 
Worth to me a 
world of gold; 
It is only this, my darling,— 
That you'll love me when riu old? 
It is only this, my darling,— 
That you'll love me when I'm old?

TAKE IT BOB, 
Sung with immense success by MISS ALMA JOURDAN. 
I'm a 
jolly young miller, Bob Bell is my name, 
And in my own village I'm well known to lame; 
I've a 
dear little sweet- heart, a 
nice little lass, 
I'm fond of her too, and I'm fond of my glass. 
Perhaps I'm too fond they say, that may be, 
I 
try to be merry, and am as you see; 
But if I 
attempt to refuse drinks a 
day, 
I 
fancy the wheel of my mill seems to say— 
CHORUS. 
Take it Bob, take it Bob, take it Bob, take it Bob, 
That's what I 
fancy my mill seems to say; 
Take it Bob, take it Bob, take it Bob, take it. 
Take it Bob, take it. its better than tea. 
I 
dreamt ' tother night that Bob Bell was no more, 
lie died at the age—well, say twenty-four, 
And I 
heard the folks ' round me say, " drinks done its 
worst." 
And although I 
was was dead, I 
was dying with thirst. 
A 
bottle of brandy close by I 
could see, 
'Twas meant for the mourners, it was'nt for me, 
And as on my bed still and silent I 
lay, 
In the distance distinctly I 
heard my mill say— 
Take it Bob, & c. 
Now I'm only up hen for a 
bit of a 
spree, 
My Pa thinks its business between you and me, 
But you know the old saying that never deceives— 
What the eye does'nt see, the heart never grieves. 
I 
must toddle at once, so good- by to you all, 
Perhaps soon again I'll give you a 
call; 
Now don't ask me to drink before I 
go away, 
Or I'm certain to fancy I 
hear my mill say— 
Take it Bob, & c.

THE NOBBY LITTLE COP , 
Written expressly for Miss ALECIA JOURDAN (
words and (
ma, 
sic) by J. 
F. 
SHERIDAN. 
At a 
glance you can see what I 
am, 
The style of my dress tells you that, 
My number is 4-2-1, 
My name it is—no matter what. 
My beat's on the east side of town, 
Amon.- the bon ton and elite, 
Where beauty and style promenade, 
The belles of the season I 
meet. 
CHORUS. 
As I 
march along on dress parade, 
Or saunter on my beat, 
The exclamations greet my ear— 
" 
Oh. Julia, ain't he sweet! 
They talk about my grace and style, 
To look at me they stop, 
This epithet they all apply— 
He's a 'lobby little cop. 
All the parties and halls I 
attend, 
The ladies invite me of course, 
An excuse the captain must get— 
Good order and rules to enforce, 
My duties I 
own I 
neglect, 
But only on occasions rare; 
And instead of wieldin ,, baton, 
I 
flirt with the ladies so fair. 
As I 
march along, Sz,c. 
I'm a 
terror to all the youmg men, 
Who hideous make ni ,
,dit with their noise; 
Anonymous notes I 
oft get, sayi g— 
" 
Please don't be hard on the boys 
They know it's no use to be rash, 
For there's two of us—me and my pop; 
And they know I 
mean biz when I 
draw, 
So they try to keep in with this cop.

I 
WANDERED BY THE BROOKSIDE 
Music Published by F
IRTH, P
OND & 
Co., 547 Broadway, New York 
I 
wandered by the brook-side, 
I 
wandered by the mill— 
I 
could not hear the brook flow, 
The noisy whee' was still. 
There was no somn, of grasshopper, 
No chirp of any bird— 
.-,nd the beating of my own heart 
Was all the sound I 
heard, 
I 
sat beneath the Elm tree, 
I 
watched the long, long shade, 
And as it grew still longer, 
I 
did not feel afraid— 
For I 
listened for a 
footfall, 
I 
listened for a 
word, 
But the beating of my own heart, 
Was all the sound I 
heard. 
He came not, no, he came not 
The moon came out alone ; 
The little stars sat, one by one, 
Each on its golden throne. 
The evening wind passed by my cheek, 
The leaves above were stirred, 
But the beating of my own heart 
Was all the sound I 
heard. 
Fast, silent tears were falling, 
When something stood behind, 
A 
hand was on my shoulder, 
I 
knew the touch was kind; 
It drew me nearer, nearer, 
We could not speak a 
word, 
And the beating of own hearth 
Was all the sound we heard.

Don't Forget the Old Folks at Home. 
Words and Music by J. F. Sirrnmax. 
For the young folks our song is intended, 
Them their duty we wish to remind; 
We hope they will not be offended— 
'Tis said, with intentions most kind; 
We know as they spring up from childhood. 
To strange, distant countries they roam, 
And seldom, if ever, a 
thought give 
To the old folks so lonely at home. 
Cnonus. 
Don't forget the p- or old folks at home; 
Remember the old folks at home; 
They nursed you with care— 
Your hardships did bear ; 
Don't forget the poor old folks at home. 
They protected and nursed, aye, and cared fol 
You, when so fragile and weak; 
They watched with affection your first smile, 
And taught you to lisp and to speak; 
And now they in turn have grown helpless, 
Old age cruel traces have shown; 
Is it right to refuse them assistance, 
And leave them forgotten, alone! 
Don't forget., Jr.c.,

MY LOVE SHE IS A 
FAIRY QUEEN 
Sung by Miss Alicia. JOUR-DAN. 
ny love she is a 
fairy queen— 
About her face no paint is seen; 
Her pretty foot is very small, 
But very large is her waterfall; 
Her ankle, too, so plump and fat, 
It makes my heart go pit-a-pat; 
Were I 
a 
bee upon her lip, 
I'd stay all day and sip, and sip. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, she never flirts—she's no coquette; 
She never scolds, nor does she fret; 
She's some on style, and full of fun ; 
" 
You bet your life," she's number one. 
I 
took her to a 
show one night, 
I 
almost knew 'twould please her quite; 
And as we sat in the parquette, 
How nice I 
felt I 
scarce can say; 
The bell it rang, the curtain rose ; 
A man came out in spangled clothes, 
Entrancing me with dashing style, 
While to my love he gave a 
smile. 
Oh, she never flirts, Lc. 
To see my love, next day I 
went— 
To pop the question was my intent; 
Alas! poor me, I 
felt quite. sore 
To hear she'd gone in a 
coach and four; 
Her mother squealed and I 
did squall; 
She'd took her trunk and waterfall; 
I 
seized my hat—to the show I 
ran, 
But she'd eloped with a 
circus man. 
Oh, she never flirts, &o.

THE SWELL OF THE DAY. 
Words and Music by J. P. SKELLY, 
Sung with great success, by Miss &sou. Jouiumw. 
I 
au a 
swell of the day—as you see— 
All other swells are but models of me; 
You must havo heard of the name which I 
bear, 
Surely you must, for I'm known everywhere; 
Girls are enchanted when I 
am in view, 
Gents are bewildered, and gaze at me too; 
Some criticise me and stare, while they say, 
" 
Oh, ain't he nobby, that swell of the day !" 
CHORUS. 
I am the swell of the day—. 
That's what the people all say; 
Go wbere I 
will, they say to me still, 
He's a 
genuine swell of the day. 
Now I 
confess I'm a 
little low down; 
How can I 
help it, when all thro' the town, 
People are praying for times to improve ? 
Still I'm contented and keep on the m^ve— 
Why should I 
grumble when care I 
have none ? 
All my delight is in fashion and fun; 
Friends crowd around me, and wine makes us gay, 
Then they all flatter the swell of the day. 
I 
am the swell, &c. 
I 
am accomplished and very refined; 
Ones I 
was rich, but my purse has declined; 
Love is a 
stranger, as yet to my heart, 
But from the ladies I 
ne'er can depart, 
They are the cause of my joy and despair; 
None can resist them, so charming and fair; 
Some spooney fellows they drive to dismay, 
But they all cling to the swell of the day. 
I 
am he swell, ar.e.

WHAT SHOULD MAKE THEE 
EAT, MY DARLING. 
As sung by Ssrzumics & Msoir. 
What should make thee eat, my darling, 
Pork and beans and mutton stew, 
Ham and veal, and roasted turkey, 
Hearts and livers, kidneys too, 
Sour krout, sausages, and limburg, 
Eggs and oysters, bread and crust? 
If you do not quit your gorging, 
Dsrling, you will surely bust. 
Beets and turnips you devour, _CM), 
Sweet potatoes take your eye, 
Cucumbers, cabbages and string-beans, lova, 
Heavy on your stomach lie; 
Quail on toast and prairie chicken, 
Taste so lovely, so you say ; 
I 
should think so, for you eat, love, 
Sixteen good square meals a 
day. 
Pickled eels feet, stewed canaries, 
Pigs feet broiled in kerosene, 
Elephants stuffed with sarsaparilla, 
Donkeys' ears with pork and beans, 
Beeswax fried in black molasses, 
Oysters stuffed with Arctic whales, 
Or frogs in glue prepared in fine cut, 
Iloopskirts broiled on monkeys' tails. 
THE ' DANCING APOLLO. 
HERE I 
am with blubber lips, 
Feet just like a 
pair of ships, 
Nose as flat as ever built, 
Eyes like holes burnt in a 
quilt, 
Mouth that spreads from ear to eat. 
Monkey shines and actions que6r, 
Dancing like a 
crazy one, 
To fill you w:th delight. 
CHORUS. 
Kick up shins, 
Full of grins, 
These the pins 
That always wins, 
Coming like an avalanche to greet you every night. 
Nigger is the great man now, 
That white folks must allow, 
Everybody clears the track, 
When they see a 
man that's black, 
Woolly head it is a 
sign, 
That the owner's bound to shine, 
If you say he isn't, 
There's sure to be a 
fight. 
Kick up shins, tic. 
When to Congress I 
do go, 
Attitude I'll strike—just so; 
Make a 
speech, it doesn't matter 
What about—just raise a 
clatter, 
All the papers call it high— 
Praise this nigger to the sky— 
Give me grand reception, 
What a 
patriotic right. 
Kick up shins, a*. 
Dancing is my greatest glee, 
When these hoofs get on a 
spree, 
Spreading out upon the ground, 
Filling up for miles around, 
Death upon all creeping things, 
Loud applause my talent brings, 
I 
always feel as bully 
As if I 
was half white. 
Kick up shins, &e. 
The constables shut down on tods, 
That makes to me but little odds, 
I 
never want to touch a 
sup, 
While I 
can keep my spirits up; 
And while the ladies take a 
glance 
To see Apollo in the dance, 
I 
like to see them view me 
With approval and delight.

THE ELEGANT SWELL! 
THE BELLE OF THE AVENUE. 
Words and Music written expressly for Miss Amu& J0171. 
DLN, by jOHN F. 
SHERIDAN. 
My kindest good evening to all, 
" 
A 
stranger," no doubt you will say; 
In that assertion your right, 
I've been here just one week to-day; 
I 
came here from Paris direct, 
I'm known in that great City well; 
Among the E7ite and Bon-7on, 
I'm known as the Elegant Swell! 
CHORUS. 
Elegant! Elegant! 
That's what they say of me, 
As I 
parade down the gay thoroughfare; 
Elegant! Elegant! everywhere greets my ear. 
In style, grace and excellence, 
None can compare. 
After my toilet, this morn, 
A 
stroll I 
took through Central Park; 
In picturesque beauty, unique, 
I 
think ' tis a 
shade o'er the mark; 
Your ladies, in beauty and style, 
In some respects Paris excel; 
And I 
flatter myself I'm a 
judge— 
Who'd dispute the Elegant Swell? 
Elegant! Elegant 1 
ito.

And challis ev'. y

So beautiful, wai dui and gay; 
The swell dim they see her, go crazy; 
And silently wish they were free 
To walk by h -r

For she will have no one but me. (Ohl) 
CHORUS. 
She is the belle of the Avenue, 
Graceful and bright, full of fairy light, 
Sweet and enchanting with eyes of blue, 
Beam rig with love and glee; 
She is the star of society. 
Pride of the ball with her fairy form. 
Joy and delight of her home so bright, 
And dearer than life to me. 
Sometimes, when it's fine in the afternoon, 
Her ma sends her out for a 
walk; 
" 
Now, darling," she'll say, " don't be long away, 
Don't stand with the voting men to talk ;" 
"0, ma!" sha replies, • do not fear me— 
Yon know such a 
thing cannot be ;" 
Then smiling she goes in all her nice clothes, 
And waits on the corner for me. ( Ha! ha!) 
She is the belle, etc. 
We walk and we talk of the latest balls, 
And view all the styles of the day; 
And when she must leave, oh! you can't conceive 
How much I 
would wish her to stay; 
But she will return on the morrow, 
That is, if mamma will agree; 
And while we're apart, I 
know in my heart, 
She's all the time wishing for me. (Al 
I) 
She is the belle, etc.

You call me sweet and tender names, 
And softly smooth my tresses, 
And all the while my happy heart 
Beats time to your caresses. 
You love me in your tender way, 
I 
answer as you let me; 
But ah! there comes another day, 
The day when you'll forget me, 
The day when you'll forget me. 
I

Is marked by thoughts I

I 
know there dwells a

In the sweet songs I 
sing you. 
I 
do not fear the darkest way, 
With those dear arms about me, 
Ah! no, I 
only dread the day 
When you can live without me, 
When you can live without me. 
And still you call me tender names, 
And softly smooth my tresses; 
And still ray happy answ'ring heart 
Beats time to your caresses. 
Hush I 
let me put that touch away, 
And clasp your hands above me; 
So while I 
asic to die that day, 
The day you will not love me. 
The day you will not love me. 
You need not check the thoughts that rise 
With darkness wrapt about them, 
For gazing in your earnest eyes, 
My heart can almost doubt them. 
Yet hush my whispers as you may, 
Such chidings do not fret me; 
lh! nO, I 
only fear that day, 
The day when you'll forget me, 
The day when you'll forget me.

BEAUTIFUL LOVE. 
LOVE, love, Oh, what is love, 'tis that makes man feel so pe-
culiar ; 
Oh. love, who does not love a 
Maud. :a 
Matilda, a 
Jane or a 
Julia ? 
Love it is, and love alone, that makes the world go round anc; 
round, 
Love is certain to be known, where 
woman's to be found. 
When one has the first attack it's like ra,sperry jam, running 
down one's back. 
CHORUS. 
h, love, beautiful love, love it is that makes a 
man feel so pe-
culiar. 
Oh, love, beautiful love, a 
man's bit a 
fool when he fails in 
love. 
Oh love, when you're in love, to presents, to parties and pic-
nics you treat her, 
Oh love, just squeeze her glove, and you feel as though you'd 
like to eat her; 
But the best of loves must part, then an end comes to your 
bliss, 
You press the dear one to your heart and take from bet' the 
parting kiss, 
Yon bid her good-bye at the door with another sly kise and two 
or three more, 
_CU love, tn.

Oh love, when you're in love ervery half hour you'd go to WU* 
her. 
But Oh, love, if she won' t 
love, you talk about drowning your. 
self in cold water; 
If it's all right she'll giggle and say please ask father if f 
may, 
Then you feel so jolly and gay, and tease her till she names the 
day, 
You'll serenade her when she's abed and her dad drops flower-
pots on your head. 
Oh love, ac. 
Oh love, when you've your love out, all the money you have 
you must ladle, 
Servants, dresses, parties, and balls, perhaps each year a 
cherub 
to lay in the cradle. 
When the honeymoon is past then your eyes are not so blind, 
Your dream was far too good to last and your face grows long 
to find, 
Your looked for happiness begins with a mother-in-law and 
beatiful twins. 
Oh love, Sze, 
MAGIC CIRCLE,

Vocalist, with tremendous applause. 
WHILE strolling through the city park, 
One evening in July, 
A 
maiden fair with golden hair, 
Came tripping lightly by; 
The lustre of her diamond eves, 
Shone around me like a 
Lirk, 
And in a 
whisper. softly said, 
Is this the city park. 
CHORUS. 
While around her slender form, 
I 
drew a

I

Down on my bended knee;

cried; arise, said she, 
When before I'd tim to speak, 
iihe imprinted one sweet burning kiss, 
Upon my lovtly cheek. 
While around her slender form, etc. 
Good-night, said she, in accents low, 
Aud geutli squeezed my hind, 
My knees began to knock and shake, 
For I

SIX FEET OF EARTH, 
Written, composed and sung by Joz A. Guticx, and sung by 
wILEy HAMILTON with tremendous applause. 
I'LL sing you a 
song of the world and its ways, 
A 
nd the many strange people we meet, 
From the rich man who rolls in his millions of wealth, 
To the poor starving wretch in the street; 
Now a 
man though he's poor and in tatters and 'rags, 
We should never affect to despise, 
But think of the adage, remember my friend, 
That six feet of earth makes all men of one size. 
There the rich man with thousands to spare if ne choose, 
But he haughtily holds up his head, 
And thinks he's above the mechanic who toils, 
And is honestly earning his bread; 
But his gold and his jewels he can't take along. 
To the world .up above when he dies, 
For death levels all and conclusively shows, 
That six feet of earth makes all men of one size. 
There's many a 
coat that is tattered and torn, 
That covers a 
brave manly heart, 
But because he's not dressed like his neighbor in silks, 
Society keeps them apart: 
On ona fortune smiles, while the other one fails, 
No matter what venture he tries, 
Till time in the end calls them both to the grave, 
And six feet of earth makes both men of one size. 
When e'er you see a 
poor fellow that tries 
To battle the world and its frowns, 
Let's help him along, and perchance he'll succeed, 
Don't cruill him and still push him down, 
For a 
cup of cold water in charity give; 
Is remembered with joy in the skies, 
We're all human beings, we've all got to die, 
And BiZ feet of earth makes us all of me site.

As sung by TONY PASTOR. 
DID you ever make love ? If not, have a 
try, 
I 
courted a 
girl once, so bashful and shy, 
A 
fair little creature who by the by, 
At coaxing and wheedling had such a 
nice way; 
Ev'ry night to her house I 
went, 
In harmless delight our evenings were spent, 
She had a 
queer saying, whatever it meant, 
For whenever I 
entered her house she would say: 
CHORUS. 
Pull down the blind, pull down the blind, 
Pull down the blind, love, come don't be unkintit 
Though we're alone, bear this in mind, 
Somebody's looking, love, pull down the blind. 
How loving we were, how cosy we'd chat, 
'Bout one thing and Cother, and this thing and that, 
With my arm round her waist, how cosy we sat, 
Like two little turtle-doves perched on a 
tree; 
Such squeezing and teasing and pleasing we had— 
Such wooing and cooing to make our hearts glad, 
With laughing and chaffing I 
near drove her mad; 
But still she was awfully spooney on me. 
SPOKEN.—And if that soldier would only have left us alone, 
elle would never have exclaimed: 
Pull down the blind, ate 
One night, fo, a 
change, we went to the play, 
And when we got home she was awfully gay, 
She saw them make love, and so learned the way, 
The plecq was " Claude Melnotte," and suited her fine; 
She called 'ne her rose- bud, her duck, and her dear, 
She thres , her arms round me, while fast fell each tear; 
She cried, oh, don't leave me, for sadly I 
fear 
You don't love me truly, say, will you be mine? 
SPOKEN, — Just at that moment a 
policeman passed, and she 
said: 
Pull down the blind, etc. 
Our courting days o'er, at last we were wed, 
I 
oft bless the hour when to church her I 
led, 
I 
now call her Mary, she calls me Ned, 
We're happy and loving, and never know strife; 
We've a 
fine handsome lass, and two noble boys, 
Trouble or sorrow, never us annoys; 
Of life we've the sweets, and while tasting its joys, 
I'm thankful I'm blessed with a 
good little wife. 
SPOKEN.—And should an angry word rise to my lips, with a 
meek smile on her face she'll exclaim:

Last night I 
was out rather late— 
'Twas only an innocent spree— 
My wife for my coming did wait, 
When sleeping I 
thought she would be; 
i 
found her in temper and tears; 
Oh! she cried, it's a 
sin and a 
shame— 
And she scratched both my eyes and my earw, 
But I 
told her I 
soon would explain.

The " Club" had a

Of bus'ness we had a 
great sight. love; 
Don't think for a

I've, only been down to the Club. 
My boots I 
left down in the hall, 
And softly I 
crept up the stairs; 
X 
kept rather close to the wall, 
And thought to ascend unawares; 
But just as I 
got to the door, 
I 
seemed to get lost in the dark; 
I

And just then I 
could only remark— 
The " Club" had, Sr,c.

And said she'd go back to her Ma ; 
While I

And tried to enjoy my cigar. 
I

dress 
If she'd let me alone for a-while ; 
Then I 
gave her a

And I 
saw her beginning to smile.

must depart.

But safe in your keeping clear, I 
leave my heart, 
Eily Mavourneen! Lily machree ! 
The ship now is waiting, out there in the bay, 
At dawn she will quickly be sailing away. 
Then good-bye, my darling, is all left to say, 
Eily Mavourneen ! Lily machree! 
In that land of promise, far ,
far o'er the sea; 
Eily Mavourneen! Eily machree! 
The land of the stranger, the home of the free ! 
Eily Mavourneen! Lily machree! 
And if in this wide world of sorrow, of pain. 
Now fate should decide that we neer meet again : 
Tien I 
should be left for to sigh all in vain, 
Eily Mavourneen ! 
Eily machree! 
Then kiss me good-bye, love, and let me away, 
Eily Mavourneen ! 
Lily machree! 
That glimmer betokens the break of the day, 
Eily Mavourneen 
Eily machree ! 
Hard fat, it may sever, but cannot divide 
Two hearts that are faithful whatever betide.

LITTLE DARLING, DO YOU MISS MV 
Music Published by Wm. A. Pond, 547 Broadway. 
Trice 40 wets 
LITTLE darling, do you miss me, 
Wand*ring from your cottage door? 
Do you linger there to kiss me, 
As you did in days before ? 
Is your gentle heart repining 
For the joys that once were thine, 
With my arms around you twining 
And your little hand in mine. 
CHORUS. 
Little darling, do you miss me, 
As you dream of days before, 
Do you linger still to kiss me, 
By the little cottage door? 
Little darling, do you miss me, 
Roaming by the streamlet tide? 
Where I 
whispered as I 
kissed thee. 
You were more than all beside? 
Does sweet memory returning, 
Bring again those happy days, 
With the never ending yearning, 
For my lips to speak thy praise ? 
Little darling, ets. 
Little darling, do you miss me. 
Do you long to hear my voice, 
Breathing words so sweet and tender, 
That would make your heart rejoice? 
By and by I 
hope to greet thee, 
As I 
did so long before, 
Are you waiting still to meet me, 
As you've done in days of yore ?

I 
am growing old and weary now, my sight is getting dim. 
And my work on the earth is nearly done; 
Old massa has departed, I 
soon will follow him, 
And my friends have cross'd the river one by one. 
Oh, ' tis saa lo bid good-by to all that was so dear, 
For I'll never see those good old times again; 
And I 
miss the happy voices that I 
fondly used to hear 
In my little old log cabin in the lane! 
Ah, yes, I 
am old and feeble now, ray head is bend-
ing low, 
And I 
never more shall hoe the corn again! 
Yet the angels they will lead me, when my time has 
come to go, 
From my litle old log cabin in the lane! 
Oh, I 
once was happy all the day, and never knew a 
care, 
And my good old wife she wander'd by my side; 
Our little home was humble, but happiness was there— 
'Twas the sweetest spot in all the world so wide! 
Now 'tis sinking to decay, and all is dark and sad, 
And I 
hear upon the roof the falling rain; 
E'en the banjo now is silent, that once made m 
glad 
In the little old log cabin in the lane! 
Ah, yes, I 
am old and feeble, /cc. 
So I'll totter to my journey's end and try to do my best, 
Tho' I'm sad and weary-hearted all the day; 
The angels soon will call me, I 
soon will be at rest, 
In that bright and happy home so far away. 
Still I 
linger by the door and try to sing my song 
As I 
used to do among the sugar cane; 
And I'm waiting for the summons, and it soon will come

When those we love are a:bseht, 
How wantonly you play;

So smoothly the water glided by, 
Making music in its tranquil flow; 
We threw two leaflets, you and I, 
To the river, as it wander'd on,

And the other floated forward all alone, 
And oh! we were sadden'd, you and I!

Might fade, and our lives be sever'd soon,

Why cold to-day? once I

Cold as if we never had met; 
Ciaa it then be hearts can forget?

Be my heart heard, or it will break, 
For one kind word; 
No TOWS to bind, no pledge I

Only be kind—speak to me, speak. 
One idle day thou did'st deplore 
Some castaway, on desert shore; 
'Twas but a 
tale, by poet feigned, 
Yet thou did'st pale, silent and pained, 
And thou did'st moan—sad, sad to be 
Utterly lone, by the bleak sea; 
My life is drear, I, cast away— 
Give me the tear thou shed'st that day.

Be bore him to his little cot, 
And dried the falling tear, 
And Willie murmured in his sleep, 
"

Untl

The N. Y. Evening _Wail writes: 
"A Little Book has lately appeared in print at Mr. A. J. 
FISHER'S, OS Nas-
sau street ca led the • Little Flirt." 
We cannot 
that we recommend 
it to our young lady and gentlemen readers. a we think it would only 
encourage the had habit of " flirting." 
Unfertunately, there is enough 
of it done without any further necessity of explaining " how. when and 
where to do it,' and this little volume would advise and initiate the un-
corrupted in practicing what is commonly called "flirting.' 
The N. Y. Eeening Telegram writes: " We have lately seen a neat little 
book, bound in Morocco leather, co ,ting twenty-five cents, called the 
"Little Flirt," published by A. J. FISHER, nat. taa Nassau street. 
It 
gives information of the modus op , randi of Ili, tires, and of the meaning 
of every motion of the handkerchief, fan, glove and parasol. 
As there 
is nothing at all objectionable in the volume, and its contents might af-
ford some innocent amusement to many, we do Lot hesitate to recom-
mend it to our young lady and gentlemen readers."

Courting Cards.—This Series of Cards has been arranged 
to meet a 
want frequently felt by young people—a want of means of 
expressing one's sentiments in such a way as to be non-committal. 
Many young ladies are visited by gentlemen who are either too diffi. 
dent or too fearful of a 
lepulse, to venture upon asking the momentous 
question. The lady is restrained, by custom and a 
sense of propriety, 
from doing anything that would seem to be an unlady-like encourage-
ment. As a 
result of this dilemma, many 
lives are spent as an unloved 
tedious existence, which might have been pro.onged and enjoyed in the 
happiness of matrimony. This pack of Cards will overcome the diffi-
culty, and being in the shape of questions and answers. will cover every 
phase of courtship. 
The sentiments conveyed therein need not be 
adopted by the parties to the game as their own, unless it accords with 
the state of their affection,., which fact makes further explanation un-
neeetssary. 
The playing of these Cards is not restricted to two players, 
but may be enjoyed by evening parties
