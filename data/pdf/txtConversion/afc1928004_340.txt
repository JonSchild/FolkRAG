Beecher is the greatest man 
That ever preached to text ; 
It must be so, the Ladies all go, 
To hear what's coming next; 
He commences very mild, 
Then he rips, swears and dams ! 
And has the cheek to tell us that, 
He's been tender on the lambs! 
CHORUS-
•Go hear Beecher, boys. 
Go hear Beecher, boys, 
Go hear Beecher, for, 
He's tender on the lambs I 
One certain Lady T. 
Who interested, went 
To hear this wonderful Beecher 
In his great argument; 
She soon was satisfied— 
She joined both heart and hand— 
Said Beecher's food was very good 
To feed the tender lambs! 
Go hear Beecher, Sas: 
Now, Beecher tried his nerve 
To preach of the promis'd land, 
But the sight of so much woman, 
He got cranky on the lamb! 
You'll find him now at home, 
Singing his new mane Psalms; 
The ending of his verses are, 
I'm still tender on the lambs I 
Go hear Beetles, &a

WHERE HAS TWEED GONE 
By JAMES CARR-
0A.N any one tell us where Tweed has:gone ? 
Old Bill has gone, the Boss has gone. 
You see, Sheriff Connor feels very forlorn, 
While sorrow is breaking. his heart. 
The Warden and Keeper have got in a 
stew, 
Got in a 
stew—in fact, into two— 
To happiness now they have bidden adieu. 
Because the chief played it so smart. 
SPotam—Among the numerous opinions that are hazarded' 
in my hearing I 
note the following; 
Perhaps he's on Jim Bennett's yacht, and plows the raging' 
main; 
Perhap3 with Babcock gone, crooked budge to straighten, 
again; 
Perhaps " gone West" with Susan B. upon a 
special car 
Perhaps he's gone to Cuba, for a 
Connecticut seed segar. 
A 
nice pile of ducats they'll pay if you bring 
This Tammany King, this Boss of the Ring, 
And Connor and Dunham and Hagan will sing 
With joy if the Sachem you'll find. 
They have sought high and low William M. to regain—. 
But all in vain, that's very plain, 
Have concluded they'll never escort him again— 
I 
think I'm of the same mind. 
1
 
&POICZN — But still I 
hear this clamor: 
Perhaps he's gone with Darwin to civilize the ape, 
Perhaps with Bristow gone " to let no guilty man escape' 
Perhaps he's gone to Utah, the Cancan dance to teach, 
Perhaps to Boston gone he is the " Third-term Ghost" 
poach.

Pull down the Blinds, you have heard, 
It has now long stood the test, 
Like Hildebrandt Montrose, 
Or, quietly, Pull down your Vest; 
NOW 
here is one, you must admit 
It's new, but it's rather too thin, 
I(, 
For the boys all do cry as you pass, 
Say, Mister! please wipe off your chin! 
CHORUS. 
For Heaven's sake, wipe off your chin! 
Your nose is a 
sight, take it in! 
The boys all do cry, as you psi them by, 
Say, Mister! Go wipe off your chin! 
There's a 
gentleman sitting right, there— 
I 
mcian you, with the dollar diamond pin ! 
Take lily advice, go get ten cents', 
So a:barber can wipe'off your chin. 
Stop squeezing that girl by your side, 
For the boys are taking you in; 
They know yon ain't go i 
a 
cent, 
So you be'ttei go wi
• pe' off your Chin 
CHORUS. 
For goodness, sake wipe off Your chin ! 
That red necktie 's 
bum! take it in; 
For the boys all will cry, Oh, shoot the old Guy! 
Or make him go wipe off his chin! 
You see, there is President Grant, 
A 
third term he is trying to win; 
But I 
don't think he'll get it—do you? 
So he had better, now, wipe off his chin! 
Now, Belknap has stePped down and out, 
For the fraud of Fort Sill was too thin; 
Then Marsh told all that he knew 
So they both had to wipe oft their chins! 
CHoRus. 
Great President, wipe off your chin! 
For you have been long enough in; 
The boys all will cry, let the Administration die, 
Then the Cabinet can wipe off their chins!

To watch the girls so fair, 
I

black-eyed girl, 
Her name was Kitty Claire.

From the maid I 
love so well,

When I

Oh, don't I

Of her I

WHEN in my dreams I 
fondly think of brother, 
When in visionslundly dream of another, 
When the night long watch is ended, 
And the busy day suspended, 
All my fancies, all my visions may come true, 
still in fancy dreaming I 
only love but you. 
Whed the midnight stars are peeping, 
And the silvery dew secreting 
Fragrance for the coming day; 
'When auroras charms are blended 
To the Southern skies extended, 
Memory paints the picture—no matter what you say. 
Deftly clings the moonlight 
On the curtained starlight, 
Chequered clouds of fancies floating all around; 
Glinted zephyrs playing—stately actions swaying,. 
in this pure Elysian—this holy fancy 'groin& 
Fire-flies dancing in the humming. 
Angels on their lutes are strumming. 
LOTS'S cohorts in armOr coming, 
O'er the mountitint'dipped in devt. 
'Victory on their banner ensigned, 
Glory on their armor entwined; 
still in fancy dreaming, I 
only love but you. 
WHERE THE ROSES BLOOM, 
Bang by HARRY W ESTERN at the Theatre Gomique, 
Washington. 
Copyrighted by KNAKE and McGoweN, Pittsburgh, Pa. 
HOW I 
love in the fields to ramble, 
To hear the rustling corn, 
And watch the silken tassels waving, 
In the sweet and dewy morn. 
I 
love to hear sweet music 
From birds in the woodland gloom, 
But the wish of all I 
have now is, 
To live:where the roses bloom. 
CHUR1JS. 
Fairest of all flowers, 
Their odor is perfume. 
But the wish of all I 
have now 
To live where the roses bloom. 
I 
love to smell the gentle lilac, 
And the honeysuckles climbing on the wall, 
With the brightly colored morning glories twining. 
In their beauty on the wall. 
I 
gathered lilies from the brookside, 
And daisies by the silvery moon, 
But the wish of all I 
have now is, 
To live where the roses bloom.

DOWN WHERE_ THE VIOLETS GROW 
y, ^ 
Bung by HARRY W ESTERN at Tony Pastor's, New York. 
WHILE strolling by a 
running brook, 
One evening in July, 
I 
met a 
maid so lovely, 
I 
winked at her so sly. 
Her eyes shone like the brilliant star% 
That winked at us you know. 
She took my:arm, I 
led her on, 
Down where the violets grow. 
CHORUS. 
For she is a 
fairy queen, 
The fairest ever seen, 
I 
blest the day she came that way, 
Down where the violets grow. 
I 
gathered flowers and decked her hair, 
Then told her of my love, 
She whispered very softly, 
You are my turtle dove. 
I 
asked her then to come again, 
Where the rippling waters flow, 
She murmured as I 
kisied her cheek, 
Down where the violets grow.

Dem was de good old times, 
When you could save de dimes. 
But now lem times am gone and passed away, 
But give we de days of old, 
And my story am Sohn told, , 
Dats when old man' Hickory iiekson had his day, 
One thing more I'd like to SO, 
Just before I

Of the times I 
use to have in Dixie's Land. 
I 
use to hoe de corn from de breaking of de morn, 
And many a

But when de work was done, we darkey's had de fun,

For de old Virginny reel, 
From de toe down to de heel,

'Tis there dwells the girl of ray heart; 
Although far from home, yet memory still, 
From old scenes would never depart. 
Tho' the notes of the trumpet would sound an alarm, 
Tho' deafning the cannon's loud roar, 
In angel stood guard and kept me from harm, 
'Twas my Molly who lives in Killmore. 
My old Killmore, 
And now do I 
seek her with love in my heart, 
With pockets and spirits both light; 
From her and my home I'll never depart, 
Until I 
forever take Plight.

Hurrah for the Minstrel Band, 
Copyright, 1876, by E. E 
HARDING, Music Pub., 229 Bowery, ICY. 
Written and sung by Frite.vK LEWIS. 
Also the BIG FOUR. 
There is not a 
man in the whole Minstrel Band, 
Who would ever go back on his friend; 
Tho' dark be his face, yet the black can't efface, 
The. kind deeds which thro' life him attend. 
I 
hear the echo sounding, sounding, 
In notes loud and clear thro' the land; 
I 
list to its voice---and it bids me rejoice,— 
Then hurrah for the Minstrel Band! 
Then Hurrah! Then Hurrah! 
Then Hurrah for the Minstrel Band; 
I 
will speak first of one whom we lov'd in the past. 
He'd a 
heart that was noble and brave; 
Nelse Seymour, who never refused his last dime, 
If he thought you from hunger 'twould save. 
I 
hear his praises sounding, sounding, 
In notes loud and clear thro' the land; 
The tall son of 'York, he has died at his Work, 
And the pride of the Minstrel Band! 
He was the pride, the pride__ 
Was the pride of the Minstrel Band! 
Brave Unsworth, he stood liks a 
Minstrel so true, 
'Jill defeated at last by grim death, 
And Budworth, alas! broke his old Banjo strings, 
Which he lov'd, 'till he parted with breath. 
I 
hear their dirge now sounding, sounding. 
In notes loud and clear thro' the land; • 
They liv'd and they died, with the boys that they loY'd. 
.The dear boys of the Minstrel Band! 
The dear boys! The dear boys! 
The dear boys of the Minstrel Band! 
t 
But now I 
must speak of 
e 
prince of them all,— 
Who is that but our own gallant Dan! 
iet ev'ry one raOrtrii, for our'ehif
eitain i i oes 
Dan Bryant, the Minstrel land Man. 
Let all his praise's be sounding, sounding, 
Inin8telsloud'and clear thro' the land. 
He livid. and he died, both our glory and pride, 
And the king of the Minstrel Band! 
Hpysts king,! He was king ! 
He was king of the Minstrel Band ! 
There is silk) finame that is well known to Fame— 
* 
George Beltnore, the. Jockey so true! 
His last race is run, and the prize he has woii; 
To the Judges his spirit it flew. 
I 
hear tbe peoPle shenting, shoUtiiag, 
As the flying Sciid passes the s6na: 
The teat, it is run, the Gold cup is won, 
He has join'd the True Minstrel Band! 
He has joined, he: 
has joined, 
He has kilned the i;iuelihi'strel Band!

Autcl ivery day at me their slang they do toss, 
And they say I

They always do give me their slang and abuse, 
They cry out " Gilhooley-, your collar is loose ;"' 
At Mulligan's wake sure they filled me with =IA 
And tould me to go out and get rueself stuffed. 
Sure, one of thim said, if I 
wanted a

To go to the river and shovel off fog! 
Eut to understand thin rm greatly at loss, 
Whin they say, " Pipe hint off—there goes yoga.

'Taw only last night, sure, they gave me a

ing interest which is insephrable rrors Mrs. Row-
son's writings, can rest satisfiea while denying them-
selves a 
perusal ci the life of Charlotte Temple's 
Daughter, Lucy fempli.. 
It is a 
sequel possessed of all the thrilling in-
terest that characterizes the life of the unfortunate 
mother, while it exemplifies in a 
wonderful manner

clisappointmenx.s. 
resulting from once yiffi-
ing to the seductive intineLce 3f passion.

The New 
York Evening Mail writes: 
A 
little book has lately appeared in print at Messrs. Fisher & 
Dmison's, 98 Nassau street, called "The Little Flirt." We cannot 
wry that we recommend it to our young lady, and gentlemen readers, 
as we think it would only encourage the bad Ir bit of "flirting." 
Unfortunately there is enough of it done without any further neces-
sity of explaining"how, when and where to do it,' and this little 
*volume would advise s 
ad init iate the uncorrupted in practising what 
is commonly called "flirting." 
The N. Y. Evening Telegram writes: 
We have lately seen a 
neat little book, bound in morocco, coqing 
25 cents, called "The Little Flirt," published by Messrs. Fieher & 
Denison, 98 Nassau street. 
It gives information of the mod us open-
andi of flirting, and of the meaning of every motion of the hand-
kerchief, fan, glove and parasol. As there is nothing at all objec-
tionable in the volume, and its contents might afford 1-orne innocent 
amusement to msny, we do not hesitate to recommend it to out 
young lady and gentlemen readers.

First Book for Mechanics, Machinists & Engineers 
By OLIVER BYRNE. 
12mo., cloth. $ 1.50. 
ENDORSEMENTS OF THE PRESS: 
The highest praise which can, be given to this excellent 
elementary work on practical mecbsnics, consists in the fol-
lowing simple statement of facts : Thu editor of this journal, 
while teaching.natural philosophY and chemistry in the 
Cooper Institute from 1859 to 1864, was in need of a 
text-
book of practical mechanics, adapted to the advanced classes 
who had been trained in mathematics; in his search among 
the many mechanical text- books, there was not o' 
so 
fully answered his requirements as the above,wortN, was 
therefore adopted and used with perfect satisfiiction, and it 
is with pleasure that he receives it now as an old friend fro'rn 
the publishers, gives it his most ea-nest recomreendrition, 
and wishes it in the hands of ail who are still in the fog- about 
tho units of work, calculation of the power of machinery, 
rekjstance to motion, strain on material, etc.—Nanufactarer 
and Builder, July, 1874. 
The author of this work is well known as an extensive 
writer who has made some valuable additions- to American 
technical literature, enumerated above in detail. 
The work 
we are now noticing is a 
theoretical treatise on practical me-
chanics, designed to supply a 
recognized deficiency. Most 
of the works on mechanics treat the subject ki a 
manner 
which is not available to young men commencing as appren-
tices in shops. 
Any young marl with a 
fair kuo,i-ledge of 
arithmetic may, however, use this work to great a " 
it is ,not only suitable for a 
text- book, but also Izs.costilri 
of reference. 
Most ambitions young men will rnakelibeni-
selves.'so fathiliar with its contents as to be hole to flier 
readily to any portion of the book. 
The author has adopted 
a 
new notation to distinguish units of work troith 
which 
not without value, and might be aq'Az-
„,4 t
