[00:00:00] Brief introduction; Seymour Ray (“Ray Idol,” “The Great Magnifico”) describes 
basic personal background information including his date of birth and current place of residence 
in Bristol, Tennessee. 
 
[00:01:47] Ray discusses some of his earliest introductions to the world of professional 
wrestling, including a match between famous wrestlers Ric Flair and Wahoo McDaniel that left a 
lasting impression on Ray. “I always respected wrestlers as athletes.” Recognizable in-ring 
characters attracted Ray to “territorial” wrestling, along with the sheer number of weekly 
televised matches. More established promotions (e.g. Southeastern Championship Wrestling, 
Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling) would run local shows near Ray’s hometown.  
 
[00:05:20] Ray outlines the trajectory of his career as an independent professional wrestler. 
Local shows helped lay the foundation for Ray’s interest in pursuing wrestling. Ray’s physical 
frame, shaped by competitive bodybuilding, often caught the eye of promoters. He shares a story 
of being approached by multiple promoters over the course of several years who offered to act as 
his managers, but Ray wasn’t convinced they had his best interests at heart. Ray details how he 
met Beau James, the owner of Southern States Wrestling in Kingsport, Tennessee. At the time, 
Ray was a middle school teacher “with no thoughts of going anywhere else,” so training with 
James for an extended amount of time was “no big deal.”  
 
Ray talks about his experience in trying-out and training at Southern States Wrestling. “Training 
was pretty intense.” Conditioning, “running the ropes,” “taking bumps,” “being slammed” were 
part of Ray’s in-ring education. Other lessons included “control” and “self-respect.”  
 
[00:12:43] Ray makes note of some of his earliest mentors including Steve Flynn, Ricky 
Steamboat, Manny Fernandez, Jimmy Valiant, and Buddy Landel among others. These 
instructors offered valuable advice that improved Ray’s in-ring performances. Ray’s career 
afforded him the opportunity to meet a handful of wrestlers he watched on television as a child. 
“I think every wrestler has an ego, and a lot of times those egos are overinflated.” 
 
[00:17:38] Ray defines the term “psychology” as it applies to professional wrestling. He 
connects it with the concept of storytelling. Ray believes contemporary pro wrestling has moved 
away from in-ring psychology and towards performances that are “highspot after highspot” (i.e. 
acrobatic stunts and highly-stylized maneuvers). “You’re telling the story in the true essence of 
the sport.” Traditional portrayals of “good guys” versus “bad guys.” Ray emphasizes the 
necessity of crowd “buy-in.” He offers several examples of what can be considered “good 
psychology.” “A lot of good psychology is gone in today’s market.” 
 
Ray attempts to draw connections between “psychology” and “kayfabe.” He sees the practice of 
“keeping kayfabe” falling to the wayside as the internet offers fans “more exposure to elements 
of wrestling that were somewhat kept a secret.” Ray weighs the need for kayfabe and what merit 
it still has.

[00:23:05] Ray draws attention to the differences between independent promotions and larger 
entertainment spectacles. He provides an example of a college athlete becoming a contracted 
professional and what skills are lost or gained in the process, especially as it relates to work 
ethic. Ray delves into the politics of professional wrestling and how it impacts both individual 
wrestlers and wrestling promotions. Nepotism is commonplace throughout the pro wrestling 
industry.  
 
[00:26:52] Ray talks about the development of his in-ring persona, Ray Idol. Similarities were 
drawn between Ray’s performance style and that of Mid-South Wrestling wrestler Junkyard 
Dog. Relatedly, professional wrestler Austin Idol was one of Ray’s favorite athletes growing up. 
“From the physique to the promos, I feel like he was one that was before his time.” Naturally, 
“Ray Idol” is ultimately a tribute to Austin Idol.  
 
Ray’s first match was in October of 2000. He assesses his strengths as a wrestler, one of which is 
his ability to adapt to his opponent. “Your goal is to put on a good event that fans want to come 
back to see.” Ray also discusses his character’s personality. “He was an extension of Seymour 
Ray.” Ray notes that he was always concerned with “fan reactions.” “Ray Idol was an extension 
of his fans, too.”  
 
[00:32:00] Ray outlines a typical show day from start to finish. He mentions feeling “butterflies” 
before matches. “You should never be overconfident about what is going to transpire.” Planning, 
exercising, interacting with other wrestlers, warming up, and performing in-ring are all described 
in detail. “Pretty much the same whether I was in front of 200 people or 4,000 people. It was 
pretty much the same routine.”  
 
Ray talks about what it feels like to perform during a match. “It’s addicting...once it truly gets 
into your blood, it’s hard to walk away.”  
 
[00:37:12] Ray considers the more challenging aspects of wrestling. Physical demands, injuries, 
time commitments, medical bills, finances, and remembering specific matches are discussed. 
Ray also grapples with the separation between Seymour Ray and Ray Idol. At the beginning of 
his career, Ray traveled and wrestled consistently Thursday through Sunday night. He describes 
finding a balance between being a middle school teacher and wrestling professionally. “If I’m 
able to make money wrestling, great. If I don’t, I have something to fall back on.” Fewer options 
exist today to earn money as an indie pro wrestler.  
 
[00:41:48] Ray discusses the intersections between being an educator and being a professional 
wrestler. Ray recalls a funny conversation he had with his school principal when he was a 
teacher. “The first comment that she made was something to the effect of, ‘Why are you doing 
this? You’re too intelligent to do this.’” Wrestling as a means to relieve stress and as a “way to 
reach kids.” Ray recounts a story where he made a meaningful connection with a student as a 
result of wrestling.  
 
Ray touches on stereotypes that are attached to professional wrestling (e.g. alcoholism, drugs, 
intelligence levels, etc.) “Wrestlers come from all backgrounds.” He brings up misconceptions

about how easy it is to become a pro wrestler. Promoters ignoring a wrestler’s ability in order to 
earn a profit. “It gives wrestling a bad name.”  
 
[00:48:59] Ray offers insight into how his career has been shaped by being a Black professional 
wrestler in central Appalachia. He talks about current race-related conversations that have 
emerged over the course of the last several months, perhaps as a direct result of the coronavirus 
pandemic. “...limited number of African Americans on the big stage of wrestling,” which has 
also extended to regional and local independent promotions. The “good ol’ boy” system as a 
harmful entity. 
 
Ray has experienced “little negativity” himself and theorizes that this could be a result of the 
image he chooses to project. He underscores the value of respect and offers examples from early 
in his career. One involves a promoter who thought Ray was white based on a phone 
conversation and the other involves an opponent with a Ku Klux Klan tattoo.  
 
[00:55:48] Ray looks towards the future of independent professional wrestling. “I think it looks 
very bright.” He remarks on the tremendous level of talent that exists in the industry, which he 
hopes will lead to a resurgence in quality promotions.  
 
Ray offers advice to those interested in becoming professional wrestlers. He stresses the 
importance of training at a “credible school.” Ray also encourages wrestlers to seek opportunities 
beyond hometown promotions. “Travel as much as you can.”  
 
[01:00:02] Ray reminisces on what he considers to be one of his “greatest matches” with wrestler 
Steve Fury. “There was a real element of ‘realness’ to our matches where we just laid it in.” 
Other matches with Thorn and Kid Kash are also discussed. Ray recalls one of his weaker 
tag-team matches against two inexperienced wrestlers at a cancer benefit show. “At this point, I 
can’t afford to get hurt.” 
 
[01:07:41] Closing remarks. “From my perspective, I have had the opportunity to meet or be in 
the ring with a lot of great wrestlers.” Ray lists additional mentors whose advice has remained 
meaningful.
