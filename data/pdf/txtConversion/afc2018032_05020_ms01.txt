Summary of Interview: Pat Kellar discusses working in different careers until she moved back to 
Wisconsin and became an EMT. She explains how she went to school for nursing and realized 
she enjoyed psych, and how she worked with all ages on inpatient psychiatric units, but 
especially loved youth. Realizing she wanted to go into management, she talks about returning to 
school to obtain an MSN, researching political participation in nursing. She states her last job 
prior to retirement was in a rural hospital. She currently serves as president of the Wisconsin 
Center for Nursing.

Introduction 
0.00.24 
Born and raised in Eau Claire, Wisconsin; lived in various states. 
0.01.27 
Goal to go to law school; majored in history and political science in Fort Collins 
at a state university; worked in banking. When back in Wisconsin—married, with 
young son—her mother decided to go to college at 49 years old. This prompted 
interviewee to go back to college. Decided to go into nursing; had never thought 
about this as career. Knew she liked people and working with people. “I thought, 
nursing you can do lots of different things and be in lots of different areas, talked 
to nurses, and decided to go into nursing—and I never regretted it. It was just one 
of those pathways that I never would have predicted but it worked out for me.” 
Knew a couple of nurses, and she was intrigued by what they did. Before went 
into nursing, went through training for EMT and was interested in and enjoyed it.  
0.03.45 
Went to school at University of Wisconsin—Eau Claire. Commuted with some 
people who worked in Eau Claire. Carpooled with another nursing student for 
most of three years, reviewing notes and working schedules and projects together. 
0.04.40 
Found nursing school to be challenging: a lot of science, math, and critical 
thinking. “I don’t think people realize what nurses need to know. And we’re 
probably our own worst enemy. We tend to underplay what we know and what’s 
going on in our heads when we’re taking care of patients.”  
0.05.15 
Was helpful to have had liberal arts credits from previous history and political 
science major during four-year BSN but didn’t specifically draw on knowledge 
from these disciplines. 
0.06.05 
Started clinical rotations second year after classes. Had EMT experience but 
didn’t really have background in bedside care of patients, so rotations “really get 
you in greater with that.” The year prior to rotations there was a ‘skills lab’ where 
you learn some of these skills, but then actually taking of patients is a whole other 
thing. Example: early on, when mostly focusing on making patients comfortable, 
went into patient’s room who was a double amputee, and the unusual experience 
threw her in the moment.

0.07.45 
Increasing levels of responsibility as clinical experience goes on. Start out with 
basic skills—making beds, getting patients into a chair—and moving on to 
increasingly complex tasks—giving patients medication, making assessments, 
reporting to other nurses. After you graduate and actually go to work, something 
of a culture shock: “It’s real, and you’re not just a student, and you’re not just 
there for a few hours.” At that time, nurses had 8-hour shifts, rather than 12-hour 
shifts. Graduate 1985 from bachelor’s degree.  
0.09.00 
Did rotations at hospital most of the time. But for the community health part of 
the program, working with public health, went into clients’ homes. For psychiatric 
clinicals at that time, each county had a facility; these are no longer in place. For 
interviewee, it was Northern Center in Chippewa Falls. 
0.09.45 
At that time all nursing students went through both community health and 
psychiatric. Somewhat different now. At that time, the curriculum was set up so 
you had at one time community health and another time something else. Now 
curriculum set up so that these are more intertwined. 
0.10.16 
At that time, program was two semesters, a summer, and then two more 
semesters: five altogether. In the summer semester, was starting to think: “You 
know, I don’t know if this is really what I want to know and panicking a little 
because I had invested so much time and money. Then I had my psych semester 
and rotation. And that was the one for me—and then I knew.” It may have seemed 
attractive—interviewee not sure—because it involved less of the clinical side of 
things and more talking with people. “I’ve always said that it’s a good thing that 
nurses don’t all want to go into the same area … We all have the area we gravitate 
to, and that’s good.” 
0.11.55 
After 1.5 years working on the psych unit, took a job as a school nurse for six 
months. Thought that would be the perfect job and had taken a couple of optional 
classes in the area of school nursing. Within a short time, knew it was not for her. 
Six months later at end of school year, got a call from hospital asking her to 
interview for management position, which worked out. Found she missed being 
around nurses and other medical people.  
0.13.30 
Not many people were going into psych field when interviewee did psych 
rotation. “Most nurses shy away from psych and mental health. They’re 
uncomfortable with that area.” “I think the majority of nurses like the 
medical/surgical part or critical care … And they’re just not as comfortable or 
don’t like it as much.” Not really any divisions among nurses with respect to 
different kinds of nursing. 
0.14.30 
First job after graduated was in psych, at Luther Hospital in Eau Claire, now part 
of Mayo Clinic, a general hospital with a psychiatric unit. They had an adult unit 
and one part of it was for children and adolescent patients. The nurse manager at a 
staff unit asked for volunteers to be among the four core nurses to work in a new 
child and adolescent unit, involved in programming and group activities. Four 
nurses, including interviewee—all new grads—raised their hands. “And it was a 
wonderful experience. We got to help build the program, and otherwise I would 
not have had that opportunity … It was just a fabulous opportunity.”  
0.16.39 
In same job: the stories patients had could be so sad. One particular young woman 
had been sexually abused by her grandfather and had lots of self-destructive 
Page 3 of 7 
 
behaviors like cutting. “I wish I knew how she was doing.” Another patient, a 
teenage boy, interviewee happened to meet at a community choir and discovered 
was doing very well, which was “really special” although patient did not 
remember her. 
0.18.30 
A typical day on the unit depended on whether you were working days or 
evenings. Day shifts would involve getting patients up and to breakfast, checking 
vitals and giving medications. Psychiatrists usually did rounds in the morning, 
and you would give them a report on how patients slept, how they were doing, 
their affect and mood, and so on. Then there were group activities, largely run by 
occupational therapists and activity therapists. Nurses would do patient education 
about medications, etc. Often ran groups, especially on child and adolescent units. 
“There was a weekend where we had lots of sick calls, and it was me and this 
nursing intern … So, I said ‘OK, here’s our plan for the day; we’re going to keep 
them busy.’ So, the unit was full—it had a max of 16, and we had 16 kids. So, we 
just had activities for the day and kept them busy, counting heads the whole 
time.” 
0.20.30 
Worked with psychiatrists, psychologists, activity therapy, music therapy. 
Relationships with these groups were good. “You had to be a team, because when 
patients act out, you’ve got to work together.” “At that time, when I first started, 
we used physical restraints a fair amount. When I became a manager, the 
regulations were changing in terms of joint commission and so on, looking at 
really reducing the use of restraints—which was good, but it meant developing 
another set of tools which you would use instead of restraints. But we did it and 
worked away from it. And they’re still used, but really only as a last resort. But 
even without restraints, if there’s someone who’s acting out, the team has to work 
together and go through training, and someone has to take the lead and know 
what’s your role.” 
0.22.05 
Took special training after starting job to work with children and adult 
populations. For first two weeks, just classroom orientation. Had hired 16-17 new 
nurses because of the new child and adolescent unit. All started at same time and 
went through training together—which wouldn’t normally happen. 
0.22.45 
Worked at this job for about two years. And then the last six months as a staff 
nurse was when interviewee worked as a school nurses but stayed ‘per diem’ on 
the psych unit, working every other weekend. And then they decided to have a 
separate manager for the adult unit and another for the child and adolescent unit. 
It was “too much” for someone to manage both. Interviewee was acting manager 
in this role for several months, and then was selected as manager for the adult 
unit. 
0.23.55 
Had started out working with adults, and even when working on child/adolescent 
unit, would work with adults when child/adolescent unit had fewer clients. Knew 
that at some point would go into management. Initially there was some nurses 
who had worked there for longer than interviewee and also interviewed for same 
position, there were some challenges. In some interactions, “had to make it clear 
that I was the manager.” But mostly a good team that worked well together. Little 
turnover in staff “because it’s one of those areas that the staff who go there tend 
Page 4 of 7 
 
to—I mean, that’s where they want to be … in psych in general.” Always a core 
group that stays there. 
0.25.55 
Would have student nurses there for their clinical rotation, and trained these 
people, and used nurse interns. Hired nurses into new positions when they came 
open—usually new grads.  
0.26.27 
Wasn’t as involved with training, usually another staff nurse. As a teaching 
philosophy, “I think what works for me is actually doing [the task] and doing that 
in a progressive manner. So, you start out with someone not giving you a whole 
lot to do, and then eventually you’re doing it all, through that orientation.” 
0.27.12 
Worked in this manager role for 10 years. Then through strategic planning, that 
interviewee was part of, that things were going away from in-patient and more 
towards out-patient. At that point, interviewee was the in-patient nursing 
director—having gone from the manager for child/adolescent down to just one 
manager. But “as census decreased as things were going out-patient and lengths 
of stay were shortening, the decision was pretty clear that the out-patient manager 
was going to be the one manager.” An opportunity arose to manage the 
emergency department, and so interviewee did that—although had no experience 
in emergency at that time. “I said, ‘I can’t do that.’ But he said, ‘They don’t need 
someone with the clinical expertise, they need someone with the management 
expertise.’ So, I went in and said, ‘I’m not going to be the clinical expert here. 
You’re the clinical experts.’ I bring the management piece to the team, and we’ll 
work together as a team.” Some could never accept that, but that worked out 
okay. “And I was able to demonstrate that that was the piece that was needed. The 
previous manager, her expertise was clinical, not management.” 
0.29.40 
A typical day at that emergency department—a big city might differ from a 
community hospital—early in the morning it’s usually pretty quiet, with maybe 
one or two patients left from the night. “And then it just builds as the day goes 
on.” Managed 2-3 nurses a shift. Went into nursing administration after that role. 
0.31.05 
Relationships tended to have more friction in emergency department. “My read on 
it was always that the type of person who works in emergency department is that 
they want outcomes, they want to get stuff done, and the adrenaline rush. They’re 
not process people at all. Whereas people who are in behavioral health, they tend 
to be more process people. And it’s just a different way of thinking about. There’s 
no right or wrong. It’s just different.” Sometimes there could be ‘turf battles’ 
between a nurse and EMTs: an EMT might want to do more than a nurse wanted 
to or thought they should be. They still worked as a team, but less so than other 
roles. 
0.32.37 
Didn’t find it hard to work in the different environment. “I think it helped that I 
figured that out … I think it made me realize that I had to help them see the 
process. They wanted to get from here to there, like, now, and I would have to 
say, ‘No, we’ve got to do it this way.’” Having a background in mental health is 
very helpful if you’re in management, although not so many people in 
management do have this background. Experience in emergency department was 
critical for moving to nurse administration role, because that department (unlike 
earlier roles) interacts with almost every unit in the hospital. Worked here 5-6 
years.

0.34.35 
While in manager role in behavioral health, had gotten master’s degree at UW-
Eau Claire, an M.Sc. in Nursing with a nursing administration focus. Program 
took seven years, on a part-time basis because of family and work commitments. 
Wrote a thesis on political participation of nurses: “they’re not very 
participatory.” Part of the project was looking at the definition of political 
participation. “Not just nurses, but people, when you say ‘political,’ they think of 
government. But really political participation is influencing what happens. And 
so, there’s political participation at the level of just being part of a committee or a  
work group and voicing what you think should happen … There’s a whole 
spectrum that’s political participation.” 
0.37.10 
There was no union in the hospital where interviewee worked.  
0.37.25 
Was drawn to nursing administration because “I liked being involved with a lot of 
different things, and see them go from start to finish … I’m a process person.” 
Worked in administration still at the same hospital, in Eau Claire for a few years, 
and then moved to Bloomer as the nurse administrator for critical access units, 
and then to  for the last ten years of career. 
0.38.45 
The critical access designation is a Medicare designation, designating hospitals in 
rural areas as having to have an emergency department and no more than 25 beds. 
They would get paid better. Designed to keep rural hospitals going, but not to get 
big, and to keep key services. 
0.39.59 
In the nurse administrator role, took a higher-level view of the overall nursing 
services and other projects—even construction projects, overseeing development 
of new services. “And that’s probably why I really liked it—because it was 
always different.” 
0.40.55 
“I always explained that my job was to support the nurse managers, and their job 
was to support their staff, and all of us, it was so that the staff could take care of 
patients.” Did not have direct patient contact in this role. After this role, retired. 
Throughout career, was active member of state nurses’ association. Joined board 
of Wisconsin Center for Nursing 6-7 years ago, focusing on nursing workforce. A 
great way to transition to retirement: hard to go from working to stressful high-
level position to being completely separate from nursing. 
0.42.43 
The Wisconsin Nurses Association represents nurses in Wisconsin—although not 
all nurses belong to it—lobbying for nurses’ issues, organizes conferences, and is 
part of the American Nurses Association. The Wisconsin Center for Nursing is a 
non-profit, and its mission is to ensure an adequate nursing workforce in 
Wisconsin. The main activity is, when nurses re-license every two years, they pay 
a surcharge and participate in a mandatory survey, and that data is analyzed and 
the Center produces a report every two years, reporting average age, gender, 
intent to leave direct patient care, etc. “So, we’ve been able to see that we’re fast 
approaching a point where we’re not going to have enough nurses in the state. So, 
we use that information to lobby for support. The key thing right now—the 
bottleneck—is that we don’t have enough faculty. There aren’t enough of them 
right now, and there’s more of them retiring. There are lots of people who want to 
go into nursing, and a big demand. But to get them into nursing, you’ve got to 
have enough faculty, and we don’t. So, using the data we have, the nursing 
educators approached the governor to put into his budget a $10 million dollar 
Page 6 of 7 
 
piece to support nurses getting their master’s or doctorate. And they would then 
have to teach for 10 years.” 
0.45.55 
Reason for the gap is to some degree that trainees are getting a DNP and 
becoming nurse practitioners. Although this is good—because there aren’t enough 
nurse practitioners. But there’s also a need for nurses to go into doctorate 
programs or even a master’s program so they can teach the community college 
level. But a lot of people aren’t doing that. “A big piece is that they pay difference 
is huge between what a faculty person and a nurse practitioner or nurse 
anesthetist—that gap is huge.” So, although people are interested in nursing, the 
economic gap produces this effect. 
0.48.00 
The demand for nursing courses greatly exceeds supply, and some go on a waiting 
list, but some are lost to the profession. Not sure how these effects have changed 
over time but has the sense that demand has increased and will continue to, as 
population ages and being living longer with chronic diseases. 
0.49.00 
A number of states now having nursing workforce centers, and a number have 
surveys. Some—not all—of these are mandatory. “The plus of them being 
mandatory is that we have a good sample—good data.” Increased greatly from a 
22% return rate when survey was voluntary. 
0.50.05 
From the perspective of having worked in many roles in nursing, the changes in 
the mental health field in Wisconsin: “We’re not unique in Wisconsin—this is a 
national situation—the lack of access to mental health services. And there are 
counties in the state that don’t have a psychiatrist. There are areas where there is 
no access to a nurse practitioner who specializes in mental. It’s not unique to 
Wisconsin but certainly an issue in Wisconsin.” Working in Eau Claire, “that’s 
another piece too. There’s a lack of in-patient beds. So, you know, the goal is to 
try to do as much as possible at an out-patient level. But there are times when a 
patient needs to be in-patient, and there’s limited beds in the state.” 
0.51.45 
At the Center for Nursing, this is not really an advocacy organization. There was a 
conference a few years ago that focused on mental health. The survey doesn’t ask 
about the mental health of nurses themselves. But it more broadly focuses on 
demographics about the workforce. 
0.52.32 
From interviewee’s own experience, nursing is a stressful job. “I don’t know that 
it’s the most stressful job. But it is stressful. But not all of it is stressful.” On 
people coping with stress: “I can remember working as a staff nurse, and this was 
before things moved out-patient. And during the winter months things would be 
very busy, and we always had a full census. And working 40-50 hour weeks, 
because, you know, you were the staff … And just supporting each other, when it 
became stressful.” 
0.54.00 
Lots of nurses who interviewee took to be mentors or inspirational. One of the 
Board members was the senator who wrote the legislation to require the surveys 
that are done—and like that, there are lots of nurses who interviewee looks up to. 
“And part of the reason that I became a member of the Wisconsin Nurses 
Association were a couple of faculty who took me to meetings—so absolutely.”
