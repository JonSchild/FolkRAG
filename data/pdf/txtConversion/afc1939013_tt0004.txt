Blackem Boogey [Textual Transcription]
RECORD 1
B3
“Blackem Boogey”, a Conch song learned and sung by Wilbur Roberts, Riviera, Florida,
January 16, 1940.
Recorded by Stetson Kennedy and Robert Cook.
This song is about a man who lived all his life in the Bahamas without telling his name.
Even when he grew up and married and had children, no one knew what his name was.
Every day when the man went to the well to draw water, he would look at his reflection
in the well and would sing the first two lines of the song. His children would stand behind
him and when they heard him sing the first two lines, they would sing the third line, and he
replied with the last line.
BLACKEM BOOGEY
“Blackem Boogey, sokkity-lendy; Kickity-boo, backity-oo.” “Is that Your name Daddy?”
“Yes, that's my name: ‘Daddy’”
