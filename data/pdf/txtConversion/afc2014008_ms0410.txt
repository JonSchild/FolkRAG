Dear Archie,
 
I thought you might he Interesste4 in the enclosed corresporxdence and t
he
 
hook.  Frankly, I wasn't sure whether I was supposed to keep the book or
 
not, so I
'a happily turnins* this protocol proble►r over to you!  If you
 
yourself aren't deeply concerned with land and power in South Amerfcan I
 
an sure you will know a student who would be nlonsed to find out about it.
 
Could you drop the Consul a letter ane pass along; a few W ass?  This seems
 
a worthy cause
_.
 
See you in October.  It's pretty awful in D
.C. just now, but the Smithsonian
 
Festival will he l
ivening WAshington up just a bit for the next few weeks.
 
I always Inew that festivals were functional!

Sear Mr. Nordiander,
 
Thank you for notifying me of Profeavor Sven Lindnvist's future visit to the
:
 
United States.  I intend to attend the American volblore fociety's meeting
 
in San Antonio, Texes this cominA October and will look forward to Professor
 
Lindgvist's address.
 
I have only two suggestions for further lecture contac t
s.  Professor
 
Archie Green, International Center for the Study of Folklore and rthnomusicol
.ogy,
 
University of Texas, Austin, TX  78712, has combined his interests in labor
 
history with his folkloric training.  He might well be the s
ource o
f s
everal
 
possible contacts, and I have taken the liberty of forwarding a copy of your
 
letter to him along; with the book, "
La m and rover in South hierics" that yore
 
an kindly sent along.
 
Then] it seems quite possible that rrofessor Yvonne Lockwood and the university
 
of Michigan where Dr. L
indgvist lectured lest year mirbt have some productive
 
suggestions.
 
I t
rope the above suggestions are veinfu n  Please convey to Dr. Li

Dear 0r. del Rosario,
 
Pursuant to written correspondence of June 9 from M. A
.milear TUado, in
 
consulting with the appropriate specialist in the Arts Endowment's Grants
 
office*, I am told that the s
ituation in subcontracting the Vistoria del C
.ustro
 
film to another agent, such as noricua College, is the following!
 
1
)  We need to receive e
a copy of the contract between the tvo agencies
 
for review by both our G
'rant's Office personnel
, and the folk Arts
 
Program staff in order to approve* It.
 
2
)  Arrangements for distribution of the films, as well as arrangements
 
for credit ,
g
iven to the institute of Puerto Rican Cultura, should
 
be worked out between the Institute and the subcontracted agency.
 
As long as the plan seems effective in reaching the Puerto Plean
 
and/or New Yoricaan cammurity, I see no reason why it would not meet
 
with our Program's approval.
 
3
)  he Institute would need to send us a request for a budget revision,
 
in which the cast-sharing and in-l
:ind contributions obligations on
 
the part of the Institute would be elicirate*d.  3 can give you our
 
Propram's tentative approval of waiving these obligations, but in
 
order for the ebanges to he formalized, our Crants Office must have
 
the request for the charges in writing before they can respond in
 
an official capacity.  I see no problem in this regard, other than
 
the time delay, V
M
I, I very much regret to any, is in most cases
 
a
z3rroxisately one month.
 
4
)  Alto with much regret, I must add  that I or n
eat empowered t
o authorize
.
 
the Immodiate use of funds to W in work on the fuze
!.  For such
 
approval to be W e by our program, the fiscal responsibility must
 
first be clarified.
 
If you should have any Ivestions regarding the details of this process, you
 
may contact either rose a
 organ or Martha rue3nhold i
n the Folk Arts FroAraam at
 
202/634-4282 r
ind/or `
's. I
.ee Dennison in the I
=ndowmen es rrants office at
 
202/634- 016.  And, as a
lways, if I may he of any assistance please do not
 
hesitater to call uron re.
 
Y
-9 . Dennison, by the wav, informs r
ye that one other alternative to handling
 
the grant Mould be to return the entire grant amount to t
he Endowment and
 
have it reissued to the new sponsor.  In doing this, you could come to an
 
aglecment with the new sponsor and Dr. "irado that the institute be given
 
appropriate mention in the file
s credits.  This alternative would relieve
 
the Institute of any fiscal responsibility in the accounting of grant monies.
 
Again, looping forward to the successful completion of this milestone file,
 
I offer any assi
_stence and cooreration within ry power.

This  letter will  inform you of a program designed  to be  of benefit  to
 
all
, Americans,  not only  those of  Czechoslovak birth.
 Attached  is a
 
description of  the aims,  accomplishments and  goals of  the Czechoslovak-
American Education Council and you will note  that  one of  its prime obj-
ectives  is  to  refute  the  hostile  foreign ideologies which now penetrate
 
our  schools and  colleges,  and  even our  libraries.
 The  success of  our
 
project would not  only enrich  the  level of education but help preserve
 
the vital principles  of  democracy.
 
When you  read  the attached enclosures we  feel  sure  that you will agree
 
with us  that  there  is  a situation fraught with danger  in our  country...
 
especially  for  the young who unfortunately  are  apt  to accept  hostile
 
written words  as  truth.
 
We  hope very much  that you will support  our  endeavor,  and  can assure you
 
that  every dollar of  your  generous contribution will be used  in  the fur-
therance of  this vitally important cause.
 Please mail your  check before
  
December  15th, if you wish it  to
 clear  your account,  for  tax deduction,
 
before  the  end of  this year.
 
With best regards,

OUR PROJECTS AND PROGRAMS
  
The Czechoslovak-American Education Council is incorporated in Virginia as
 
a non-profit, non-political organization.
 Incorporation papers authorize
 
the Council to engage in any lawful activity relative to American, Czech
 
or Slovak educational, literary, scientific, religious or other charitable
 
programs.
 
From contributions already received, the Council has been able to
 
(
1) contribute towards the establishment of the Chair of Czech and
 
Slovak Languages at the University of Chicago;
 
(
2) finance the publication of Milada Horna's Czech Readings and  
Conversation Drills, which has been widely used by U
.S. universities
 
and government language schools;
 
(
3) finance the publication of a monograph on the Czechoslovak historian,
 
Frantisek Palacky, by Professor Francis Schwarzenberg.  American
 
students of European history will find many hitherto unpublished
 
facts in this essay.
 
In addition to activities similar to those above, we hope our programs will
 
soon include:
 
(
a) financing classes in the Czech and Slovak languages;
 
(
b) commissioning treatises by U
.S. scholars to refute certain erroneous,
 
damaging or offensive statements about both American and Czechoslovak
 
history and philosophy and the American economic system.
 Such
 
statements, regrettably, are found in an increasing number of books
 
available in American schools and libraries.
 
(
c) granting scholarships to especially qualified students of American
 
and  Czechoslovak history, of sociology,  the arts, economics or
 
political science;
 
(
d) financing visits to the United S
tates by deserving Czechoslovak
 
citizens, anxious to study our system of government.
 
The Council has been granted the status of a publicly supported organization
 
and, therefore, all "gifts, bequests, legacies, demises and transfers" to the
 
Council are deductible for federal estate and gift tax purposes.

FEBRUARY 1980
 
TO MEMBERS OF THE HONORARY COMMITTEE
 
AND THE ADVISORY COUNCIL
 
On December 31,  1
979,  the Council completed the required five-year "advance
 
ruling" period, and now, within a few weeks,  looks forward to being granted
 
a permanent publicly supported organization status, under which contribu-
tions to the Council will continue to be deductible from taxable income.
 In
 
1
979 we have increased the number of members of our Honorary Committee and
 
the Advisory Board, as listed in the enclosures; former Senator Roman L. Hruska
 
and d
ime. Jarmila Novotna are now also members of the Honorary Committee.
 
Our main objective is now the development of educational programs which will
 
benefit not only those of Czech and Slovak origins, but all young Americans
 
who include the future leaders of our nation.  Many of them are now -- we are
 
afraid -- often being misinformed about the values and principles which have
 
so greatly contributed to our country's two centuries of progress and success
 
in both domestic and international affairs.
 For the support of these programs
 
we will seek and hope to attract financial assistance not only from the pub-
lic but also from private foundations and government sources.  While our major
 
projects are still in the planning stage, we have already been able to finance
 
the publication of the two educational pamphlets listed in the enclosure, and
 
to make modest contributions to the following Universities:
 Brown University,
 
R
.I.; University of Chicago;  Indiana University; Lawrence University, Wisc.;
 
and the School for International Training, Vermont.
 
Last fall,  following a reception for members of our Honorary Committee at the
 
home of Dr. and Mrs. Jerome Lord, we agreed to support the very worthwhile
 
production (
the first fully staged in the U
.S.) of Dvorak's Opera JAKOBIN, as
 
r
eported in the attached press release.  Our participation not only materially
 
assisted the Sokol Opera Society to balance its budget for JAKOBIN, but earned
 
our own Council's treasury many direct and most welcome contributions as well.
 
Upon receipt of our permanent status as a publicly supported organization, we
 
plan to intensify our search for additional financial sources.
 Our new letter-
head can be printed, and we will soon proceed with our first nation-wide fund
 
raising campaign.
 Because our Councilhas no "membership," as such, we plan
 
to establish several classes of "friends" of the Council, with graduated an-
nual contribution rates in each category.
 
We deeply appreciate your interest and support and hope to soon bring you
 
good news of our major projects.  Your comments and suggestions as well as re-
quests for additional information shall be most welcome.
 
With warmest regards,
 
Dr. Joseph Hasek, President

TO MEMBERS OF THE HONORARY COMMITTEE
 
AND THE ADVISORY COUNCIL
 
Pursuant  to  our February report,  we  are  pleased  to  inform you  that
 
your  Council has  been  granted  a permanent  status  as  a publicly  sup-
ported  organization.
 
We  enclose  a partial  copy  of  the  respective  IRS  ruling  dated April  24.
 
You will  also  find  a copy  of  a November  25th  fund-raising  letter  which
 
was  used  in  a limited  pilot  project  and  addressed  to  250  selected  in-
dividuals  of  various  professional  backgrounds,  from all  over  the  U.S.A.
 
It  also  occurs  to  us  that  you would  like  to  know  that  the  Czech conver-
sation book,  described  in  (2)  on  the  grey  sheet  attached,  is  already
 
being used  to  teach Czech  conversation  in  the  Department  of  State,  the
 
Department  of  Agriculture  and  a number  of  Universities.
 
With best wishes,  I remain
 
Sincerely yours,

Dear Ma. Ruekes.
 
T an sorry if I t
rot your bones up to no avail.  The Nationrl rndowuent for

student projects.  I sitml
_y sent you the Poxfire materials hecausae T
. thought
 
you might find ther
e Interesting and stimulating.
 
4ctr
.ially, one of the }
asst interesting things about the  '
roxfIre i
dea is that
 
it has been able to be introduced into high school curricula without requiring
 
outaide m
eanies.  I don't of course know about your schoo ls facilities, but
 
many such rrolects are oubl
.iah
l
 ed in inexpensive offset or even missspograph form
 
and are Rold at low cost.  You m1p
,
.ht want to vrIte the editor of the newsletter
 
I sent you, Mrs. Sherrod Reynolds, Rabun Cap, Ceorgia and r
isk her to send you
 
some came studies. I think she has several Publications t
hat describe how
 
various schools started their awn =all  publications.

tar of recording local history and sigrific-itt
 
folklore.  1

► n
ctnol stu,lents, no matter ?
sow g
ifted, j
ust usually aren't
 
sophisticated enough to do a professional loh of recording folk tales and son'
-s3
 
and transcribing them properly.  Rosides a lot of the f
inest older folk artists
 
just won't tell a voting person everything they kncw.  Lots of the most Inportant
 
and significant songs, tales. and histories .
are for gowns-
u
p
s.
 
T would suggest toast If Sou to ahead and do same of this project yourself, you
 
would not think of it an  '
bits and nieces of Trulkese culture - but as a way
 
of perhaps helping your hushand in his I.Mortart Trukese oral history project.
 
Just getting the geneologies all straight could make a fascinating interview
 
Project for your students, and the adults on Trul,
-, I abould think
., would be
 
delighted to have such information available in whatever fo nt.  This is l
ust
 
a sugstestion.  Really, I thick you a
anA your husband ought to be the prirarq
 
collectors of Trukese culture.
 
1 am sending* a copy of your letter to "
'r. Rallendorf at the Micronesian Area
 
Research Center on Guam an,1 to Roy l

- 2 -
 
concerning tax-exempt status, I think that our governments (
the United States
 
and the Federated States of Micronesia) have not yet worked out all the details
 
of our new relationship.  You could, however, apply for projects through either
 
MARC or C-PAC for the time being.  I shall enclose another copy of our brochure;
 
you will see that there are dates scheduled in the back for applications.

I really feel that I have let you down, my dear friend.
 Somehow, we should
 
have arranged some indcredibly enormous signal of your wedding -- a hundred
 
parachutists floating gently down over central Nebraska; a phalanx of a
 
hundred hoop snakes, mouth to tail, rolling down Route
 , a marathon polka
 
contest in Scotts Bluff, the winners to be featured at the 1982 Worlds Fair
 
in Knoxville, Tennessee.
 (
The last part of this is really true.)
 
But somehow none of these seemed enough, and so -- human imaginations being
 
as limited as they are -- we did nothing at all except think of you and Linda
 
and smile at each other when we remembered that tomorrow, or today, or yester-
day, or two weeks ago, was our Roger's wedding day.  We were -- and are --
so happy for you both.
 It is seldom that we get to celebrate a happy time
 
for our friends.
 
I hope that Linda will_not take umbrage (
whatever that mysterious substance
 
may be) if I write to you, Roger, very directly for just a moment.  As my
 
Jewish friends say, my dear, you are a mensch, and there are not so many of
 
them to call upon these days.  As you know, I relied on your sound judgment
 
and your integrity at every one of the panel meetings in your three years.
 
I believe just now we are sailing directly into extremely hard times, when
 
all of our best qualities will be strained to the utmost.
 I do believe I
 
can count on you and I hope you and your beautiful wife will feel welcome to
 
call upon me.  We must all hang together and maybe so we can withstand the
 
parlous winds that I know will beat upon us all.
 I have just come home from
 
a purely social party where a gentleman of my years suddenly turned upon me
 
and said "I hope you'll go on back to California and earn yourself an honest
 
living for a change."  We had heretofore exchanged perhaps two sentences, but
 
his mouth was a tight slit and he was spewing forth perhaps a twenty year
 
accumulation of bitterness.
 
I didn't mean to bring up hard problems or hard times either.
 In Nebraska the
 
next few years should signal the time of the Welsch, a golden age when the cry
 
of the hammer dulcimer is heard upon the land, and when a man can settle
 
beneath his vine and fig tree with his beloved and live in peace and unafraid.
 
Affectionately,
 
Bess

De r
r Ms. Foster,
 
I am delighted to hear that the Kansas Stntee historical Society is Interepted
 
in the notion of a state folk arts coordinator position.  I shall enclose for
 
your reference a packet of one and two paves reports drawn up a year ago by a
 
number of folk arte coordinators Ascrihinp their own particular programs.
 
Though s
omewhat out of date now, T think these
s l
ob descriptions can gives yots
 
a notion of the range of Possibilities and problems.
 
I shall also enclose our guidelines, incluOing application forms, and  a fev
 
copies of our s
s
t
sall brochure.  Additionally, You might want to t
ake the
 
following observations into consideration:
 
Fiscally spearing, we try to be extremely flexible ir our funding of
 
these positions, at least for the f
irst year.  As the program proves itself,
 
W
 assumes t
hat nore hard dollars will he contributed from the state sponsors,
 
and T
r
es r
usks ever? effort to he comnletely out of the picture by the end of
 
the third year of federal funding.
 (
we can, of course, assist with any
 
number of plojects after the third year! i
t's Just the position i
tself that
 
we feel should be
' 
- locally supported hY that time.)
 
The application should be accompanied by a Job description and a state-
ment of
. qualifications.  The former should combines both f
lexibility (
You don't
 
want to tie Yo"r person's hands) while at the same t
im e showing some serious
 
Planning.  The qualifications should be professionals I a
lways recommend at
 
least an M
.A. In folklore, ethnomusicaloay, anthropology or a related discipline
 
that would bare given the applicant s
ave cross--cultural exneerlence7 and some
 
period of serious field work.  Other factors you night lone for include
 
administrative experience (
least Innortant, for my money), language skills
 
including
, knowledge of a foreicn language, documentation and production
 
experience (
familiarity with cameras, tape recorders, video, radio, f
1ln or
 
recording production and so forth).  The current issue of the Endowment's
 
publication, The Cultural
. Pont ban an article on the work of various state
 
folf arts coordinators that makes the possible variation in both needs and
 
approaches very visible- there o"gbt to be a cony available at the Kansas
 
Arts Commission.
 
I hone this will Five You a f
ew ideas of the potentlat of this rroara?^.
 
We're very exciter' to hear that Fznsas may he joininv in! T really don't
 
think vou`d renret it.  Please don't hesitate to ask if there is any
 
additional Information you Fl ?ht want or need , a rer

Dear rirk,
 
I hope my recent telex didanot worry you.
 I am still trying to
 
learn how best to handle problems over such vast distances.
 
Basically, I was trying to find out whether or not it was admini-
stratively possible for you to help us out with a problem before
 
I took the t
ime necessary to get a letter to you laying out the
 
case.  In the meantime, I find to my relief that Roy Helms has
 
already discussed the matter with you in Honolulu.
 
;
g
iven so, I should recap to wake sure the message got to you
 
correctly.  The Folk Arts panel at its March meeting approved a
 
grant to the Palau Museum to produce and distribute a film on the life
 
and work of
 C harley Gibbons.  The film
s
= was to be made by Dan Baker,
 
and I believe he drew up the application although Tina Rehuher,
 
the Palau museum director, signed the application both as author-
izing official and project director.  So far, we thought, so f
lood,
 
until we determined that the Palau Museum does not have the essential
 
tax status with IRS and neither does any other Palauan organization
 
as far as I can discover.  I suppose this awaits the ongoing ne-
gotiations between the two governments.  Anyway, we have to find
 
another sponsoring organization in order to be able to release
 
any funds.  Dan wants to start this summer, probably in July.
 
when I discussed the situation with Dan, he said he would like
 
very much to work through MARC or C-PAC.  However, C-PAC doesn't
 
have its tax status either and all their funds are funneled through
 
Arts Alaska.  That just began to seem too bizarre to me -- a pro-
ject involving a filmmaker in California and an artist in Palau,
 
funded through an arts organisation in Ataskai
 x began to worry
 
that it would raise unnecessary questions in our agencys besides, I
 
personally want to be sure that things are set up so that Dan not
 
only makes a good film but handles himself well in Palauan terr
vs
 
and keeps proper track of the money.  Wverall, although Roy Helms
 
-2-
has kindly kept the C-PAC offer open, I would feel infinitely
 
better if the whole project could be handled by MARC as the logical
 
sponsoring organization physically closest to the scene.
 
So, fby tells we you said you #ight consider taking the project on,
 
and I for one would be enormously grateful.  I am enclosing a xerox
 
of the grant proposal so that you will know as much as we do, and
 
so that you can show it to any university officers who may be in-
volved.
 Please feel free -- as you gust know you are -- to turn this
 
down, after reflection.  I realize there way he sc
are potential pro-
blems; however, I hope ,
you will agree that this is a rood project
 
and one that should be carried forward.
 
in order to change sponsoring organizations, my prFogran
• admini-
strator, Martha Kuenhold, tells me we will need two thing s  a
 
letter fron a University of Guam official authorized to receive
 
federal grants accepting the grant (
I hope you yourself can do it)s
 
and a letter fror Tina Rehuher releasing it.  I am writing Tina in
 
this same hail and will enclose a xerox.
 Perhaps if you are in
 
touch with Palau via shortwave, you could get a chance to discuss
 
the matter further with her.
 I don't want Tina or any other Palauans
 
concerned to feel that we are snatching the grant away without con-
sultation.
 
we have received, by the way, an application for a folk arts
 
coordinator position from Sister Callista.  I am so pleased, and I
 
hope it will pass our panel's review without any difficulty.  Funds
 
are tight, but I do believe if we could get an experienced cultural
 
worker into such a position for even a year or two,  it would be
 
very helpful. to MARC as well as to the Arts council.
 
with all best wishes,

 Council report on Program matching requirements
  
As you may know,  the Policy & Planning
 
requested,  at its April 8-9 meeting,  a
 
of the National Council on the various
 
Endo%o
rient Programs.
 
Committee of the Council
 
report to the May meeting
 
matching requirements of
 
The purpose of this report is to inform the Council of the current
 
range of Program policies on matching requirements and the reasons
 
for these various requirements.
 This report will also examine
 
whether and to what extent an Endowment-wide policy might be
 
feasible.
 
In order to prepare this report in time for the May Council
 
meeting, we need your answers to the questions below by noon,
 
Thursday, April  16.
 
1.
 Other than grants to individuals,  does your Program have
 
any funding categories where matching our funds is not
 
required or generally waived?
 If so,  please specify.
 
2.
 For your funding categories in 1981, what kinds of matches
 
were required?
 Cash?
 Any combination of cash and in-kind?
 
Any limitation on the percentage of in-kind match?
 Please
 
specify your funding categor -
-s,  your requirements,  and
 
rationale.
 
11  
3
.
 For your funding categories in 1982, what kinds of matches
 
are required?
 Cash?  Any combination of cash and in-kind?
 
Any limitation on the percentage of in-kind match?
 Please
 
specify your funding categories, your requirements, and
 
rationale.
 
4.
 Do any of your 1981 funding categories require more than a
 
1:1 match  (
for grants using Program funds)?
 If so, please
 
list funding categories, your requirements, and rationale.
 
5
.
 Do any of your 1982 funding categories require more than a
 
1:1 match  (
for grants using Program funds)?
 If so, please
 
list funding categories,  your requirements,  and rationale.
 
- 3
 
6.
 Are there funding categories in your Program  (
in 1981 and/or
 
1982)  in which the Endowment contribution to projects
 
typically represents less than 25% of total project costs,
 
for which Treasury Funds could be used or, alternatively,
 
a higher than 1:1 match in Program Funds could be required?
 
7.
 In your Program, do you feel that grants over a certain
 
amount or grantee organizations above a certain budget level
 
might require, or be required to provide either a cash match
 
at 1:1
 or a higher
. than 1:1 match  (
of whatever kind)?
 
If so,  above what levels of a
)  grant
 b
)  organizational
 
budget size?
 
8
.
 Do you feel that an Endowment-wide policy  (with enough
 
flexibility to allow for exceptions,  as necessary)  could
 
be developed on the basis of 6
.  above?
 
i
 
4
 
Do you feel that the Treasury Fund represents any special
 
advantages in leveraging private support,  beyond what
 
stricter matching requirements in your Program would provide?
 
(
For example,  do you find that the requirement to obtain a
 
cash donation "up front" to release Treasury money helps
 
your grantees to obtain or maintain foundation support?)
 
10. After the first cash gift that matches the Treasury Fund
 
grant 1:1,  do your grantees in fact fulfill the second
 
half of the Treasury matching requirements?  What docume n-
tation of match do you require in your final reports?
 
What kind of compliance do you receive?
 
11.  Could your Program/the Endowment be making more creative
 
use of Treasury Fund?
 How?

Subject:
 Sore ideas for discussion at the Endow- ent "Fetreat`'
 
1
)
 I want first to quote,  in part, a paper that Folk Arts
 
panelist Free' Lieberman wrote during the discussions over
 
the integration of Folk-Ethnic Music with Folk Arts...
 
Consider,  if you will that all
. rusic activities must
 
be complete corzrsunications systers if their potential
 
is to be fully actualized.
 A necessarily simplified
 
model of such a system is:
 
creator - performer - distribution media -
° audience
 
(concerts,  tours,
 
records, tapes,
 
radio, tv, film)
 
Changes at any point in the system will affect every
 
other point in the system.
 For exa{rple, an inappropri-
ately srlall audience in an oversize hall  (distribution/
 
audience mismatch) will tend to detract fro-n the duality
 
of the perforrance...
 
The Endowment's outside funding might be injected at
 
any point in the system.
 In deciding how to apportion
 
its limited resources fairly and efficiently, the
 
Endowment must consider first the nature of the total
 
system being funded, then the relative effects of
 
funding different elements of tree system.
 The complexity
 
of such situations is apt to be so enormous that one
 
can never anticipate all
. possible influences_ and results;
 
one must make considered judgments based on the best
 
information available, and try to ipprove the batting
 
average by careful evaluation of results.
 Does this
 
happen now?  Are we aware of successes and mistakes and
 
do we learn from them in an orderly way?
 
I first found this paper of Fred's a hit repellent,  full of
 
jargon and lacking in soul.
 I notice, however, that
. I con-
tinually refer to his notions somewhere in the back of m
ay
 
heady  it has clarified my thinking, particularly the point
 
about which stage of the process might be the most effective
 
for federal fundina.
 Some Pndou
-ment Froara:rs  (such as Fold, Arts)
 
- 2 -
 
seem to try to contribute at every stage of the communication
 
process: maybe we'd do better to analyze the cycle with
 
greater thoroughness and concentrate on one or two points,
 
rather than trying to do everythina a little bit.
 At least
 
the ilea might he worth discussion.
 
2
)
 A second problem I O like to brined up is whether there
 
are not national issues within each discipline that need
 
our rrimary consideration.
 I define these quite simply:
 
national issues are those that reach across state lines
 
and can only be handled effectively by the federal
. government.
 
They are things that will not be lone if the federal govern-
ment s
loes not do them or does not bring pressure to see that
 
thov are: c
lone.
 
Such issues can ranges from the: off-Y;eat  (e.g. Pete Seeger's
 
suggestion that the telephone company be urged to set their
 
dial tone to 440 cycles so that everybody in the country
 
can tune up by just lifting a receiver)  to the sobering
 
(
the decline in traditional crafts due to the difficulty
 
and expense involved in locatinrx materials from fine lace-
making thread to Indian beads);  from the inter-federal  (
the
 
chronic problem of junk souvenirs sold in National Park
 
Service facilities while local craftsmen can't find a market)
 
to those involving the pr&vatew sector (e.q. Michael straight's
 
suggestion that t
l;e Fne
.owment could increase nublic interest
 
in music by ur
.?ing television manufacturers to increase the
 
quality of the sound equipment they put in their sets.)
 
The thing I
'm getting at here is my continued feeling that
 
the National Endowment for the Arts has, primary to its
 
purpose, the responsibility for meeting national needs,
 
needs
  that are too pervasive to he net by local or state
 
arts adninistrationn.
 It seems to me that these problems
 
should
. aet priority attention.
 As of now, we only get a
g-
round to them when the c
lay-to--day grants requests have been
 
`
candled.
 
3
)
 7
% clarification of the comple mentary roles between federal
 
and state funding is, it s
ere
 ens to me, necessary.
 ?
such of
 
the verbiage that surrounds the "partnership" deems to me
 
obfuscating and inappropriate.  The fact is that the U.S.
 
Constitution has set up an intrinsic, essential, and productive
 
tension between federal and state/local c
aovernance.
 We must
 
preserve this creative= tension at all costs.
 Where are some
 
things the federal government can do that the states can not
 
do.
 There are some things the states can e
go that the federal
 
government can not do (at least, not nearly as well).
 There
 
are some things that both bodies can do, and it all depends
 
upon which state and which federal government.
 I think we
 
must work towards clarifying this s
ituation, rather than
 
muddying it further.

)
 We need to do some heavy talkinr
.
 
international responsibilities.
 I don't
 
disciplines, but in Folk Arts we typically
_
 
our least useful -
models.
 In both cases,  "show-b.,_
 
primary criterion.
 I can tolerate this in terms of irpaL  ,
 
but the cultural items we have exported as "folk arts",
 
particularly in performance areas, are shameful.  At the same
 
time, this seems to me a secondary responsibility; the balance
 
between our national and international responsibilities is
 
really tricky.
 There are, it seems to me, a .
few things we
 
might be able to c
oo
 
a.
 We can e
l*pha
.size, as our area of Primary concern,
 
our contiguous neighboring nations:
 Mexico, Canada, the
 
Caribbean islands, et al.
 Here we have the greatest areas
 
of mutual concern, the most imposing cultural overlaps, the
 
greatest need for co miunication and mutual endeavor.
 
b.
 r
i
de can an.? we must break the restraininct shackles
 
of western European artistic styles in terms of our artistic
 
export and import activities.
 I art a strong supporter of the
 
classical symphony, but I fran8ly see absolutely no justifi-
cation for the federal government of the United States spending
 
a nickel to import or export any of the major symphony orchestr as
 
of the world.
 We muit think about what we have that is unioue
 
and especially American; we must think abont what the rest of
 
the world has that is not duplicatahle in the United States.
 
'
.
Where is not enough money to do otherwise.
 
5
)
 Underneath all of the foregoing, I believe, is ny uneasy
 
sense that the Endowment is doing too much responding and not
 
enough leading.
 This sense has been reinforced in our planning
 
and budgeting exercises.
 Planning should precede budgeting,
 
not the other way round.
 The numbers
 the actual dollar
 
arounts -- should be the final point in a steady proeression
 
of setting coals and mee maluatinq strategies.
 I do not see
 
the political likelihood of the Fndowment's netting ever-
increasing funO
ling, particularly on a "business-as--usual"
 
basis.
 We must continue to develop ever more cost-effective
 
ways to encourage and enhance Arts activities across the nation.
 
Pitting one program against another, or setting up arbitrary
 
percentages for budgetinar does not serve that end.
 At some
 
point, the collective imaginations represented in the Endowment
 
must be encouraged to fly.
 
6
)
 And finally, a word about housekeeping.
 Except in a very
 
few areas, we are sloppy and careless in the facr we present
 
to the world.
 It's remarkable that our staff keeps such
 
cheerful dispositions when they have nowhere to put things
 
except to pile them on the floor, when halls leading into
 
their offices are full of trash, whbn hhkir walls are bare,
 
even of informational signaae.  We certainly don't look
: Uke

an agency dedicated to art, for heavens sakes.
 we need
 
sojr
,ehody to do Bert xuhli's Old job, checking round to keep
 
people up to snuff, drean
nina up ways in which furniture can
 
he core effectively arranged, finOinq the furniture needed,
 
fraying art and decoratkiggour-?
 alts.
 Z am sure this all
 
wounds trivial, but public style is crucial to a bpu.Olic
 
agency.

From:  Less Lomax Hawes
 
In working through the diary (
I'm still at it!) of my Micronesian trip, I
 
came across a note saying that Sister Callista requested me to determine
 
whether or not a legal document exists proving that the Insular Arts Council
 
of Guam has 501 0 status, and if so, where is it?  She would like a copy
 
post-haste, if sucks a thing exists.  If not, I suspect she would like a nice
 
legal explanation.  Could you take care of this for her?  I was completely
 
flummoxed.
 
Yes, I will get you a report.  I don't seem to get any time at all to myself
 
these days, and nobody much cares about Micronesia except for me and tree and
 
C-PAC so it gets pushed to the bottom of my pile...

Dear Farb,
 
Just a quick note to tell you that I last week participates In a neeti g
 
with Mrs. McClure, the wife of the Senator from Idaho.  Mrs. l
fcClure
 
appears to be extremely interested in Idaho art and 1s talking about various
 
ways to promote it, including sponsorship of one or another kinds of
 
exhibition.  I had better not get any more
=
. E
siecific at this point since she
 
is not definitel9 committed to one scheme over another.
 
Anyway, w
ee did talk about folk .
art in Idaho. and she seemed, at least by
 
the end of
, the couuve
,reation, quite intereste4.  I do believe that '
per Perce
 
Beadwork, Mormon quilting, l
.estherwor'x, pottery and the like will be a p*rt
 
of whatever it is she finally decides to try and do, so I thought I Just
 
might give you a little notice.  I mown you're worrwin7 over your projected
 
recordings at this point, but think c
a thought or two about I
daho traditional
 
crafts too, and maybe you can complete t
he conversion of `
ire. McClurel  She
 
seemed a dice lady, and reasonably knowledgeable o
►.ce her mind was turned
 
in that direction, but the just hadn't thought of folk arts before.
 
We'll be in touch right after the panel

Dear ;Overly,
 
My goodness,  You sound so ditty, not to mention high style, in your last
 
letter I
'm almost afraid to write you.  Robinson & Associates!  Wawt
 
I
'm really happy for you honey.
 
Just to catch you up on fa
mily s
tews, you heard that Shirley is na
.rried.
 
Please address her now as Mrs. Tom Duggan, and you'll find that (
though
 
she's still our same
 !
salty Shirley) she's really happy to be a Mrs.
 
once again.  Foss Is a Food man; he's going to learn a lot from being around
 
our old girl
..  The same address will raise her.
 
I
'm glad that the festival i
ts going well.  Things in nashington, as I
'm sure
 
you know, are a bit gloony.  Actually, I
'm writing you to sup7est, as I
've
 
suggested to all our current grantees, that if vote have another project
 
you're secretly holding to your bosom, you might want to try to get it in
 
for our April deadline.  We will expand all our 19.81 moneys at that deadline,
 
and (
as of t
he; moment I write you) we don't know what we'll have as a budget
 
for 1932.  So -
-- my feeling is _- overTbody should get their requests in
 
risht now while we know what honeys we have available, And we'll hone the
 
panel divvies things .
up effectively, honestly, and evenly.  I
'll enclose a
 
copy  of our guidelines and a copy of the program brochure for your use.  You
 
.
now, I really like thia brochure, this time.  The rhetoric is a hit old-
fashioned, but it still i
s good, I think7 and the pictures give you the whole
 
story of -

Dear
. Ana t
;
alrta,
 
I an sorry to confirm our conversation of t
he other evening and t
ell you
, t
hat
 
the Folk Arts Panel did not approved your r
equest for $
42,577 for t
he 1
9E1
 
LO
W Aldea Festival.
 
The reasons -- taken from our panel notes in no particular order -- are as
 
follows.  This was a request for third year funding for the same event, and
 
our guidelines suggest that we only rarely furA the sa
me event beyonJ two
 
years.  Theca t
he amount requested was almost three times t
he amount we were
 
able to contribute t
o t
l
:is event in IP80.  Desides the f
act t
hat we v
eneratly
 
anticipate being asked to fund a s
n►allear not a larger amount each year ; t
he
 
Program's total allocation for t
his past f
isca? year hardly kert up wit , 
inflation, while onr application load i
ncreased enormously.  We s
i K & d
id
 
not have the money to fund a great many highly worthy such smaller projects,
 
an3 your event appeared to be ever-increasing in sire.
 
Finally, site visit reports from l
ust year suggested that t
here was ;enerally
 
l
ittle distinction drawn between r
e
aneral ethnic and traditional artists, t
hat
 
the presentation of the artists was not careful and informational, and that
 
certain of the aspects of
. the l
.oizea Aldea Festival in the t
raditional sense
 
were not fully observed
..  These problems were certainly partially offset by
 
t
he same reporters who said that t
he audience you reached w
e*s e
sxtrevesly la me
 
and t
hat the event was obviously successful t
o terms of attendance and
 
participation.  However ; in a year Ken Folk Arts was extremely hard-pressed
 
for funds, this application, which reached us very late ane at t
he last possible
 
minute, was simply not competitive.
 
Ana -
C
arta, I ar not at all sure t
hat you really want to sake thla i
nto a Falk
 
Arts tvoe of event.  There are many ways t
o celebrate, and our rules are not
 
appropriate for s
ome of t
hem.  I don't believe you have ever been comfortable
 
with t
he
: Folk Arts guidelines.
 
T apologize for any apparent nesl
.e*ct in returning your calls.  As you might
 
i
r
+agine, we are very concerned theme nays about t
he Aene~ral federal budgetary
 
problem, and I find vyself in almost constant meetinve, thus t
hrusting a l

Dear Wayne,
 
I a
n
t sorry to have been so dreadfully lon? in answering your letter.  I was
 
in the hospital for a while, and that set me behind in r
Av work, and then I
 
toots a quite long business trip in January, which only added to the pile-
-tip
 
of unanswered mail.  I really do apologize.
 
I guess one of the reasons your letter gravitated to t
he bottom of t
he pile
 
was that I didn't quite know tow to a
nswer i
t.  Vie sons that you sent titled
 
"Dinmond Joe" Is a parody written by Py husband for a B
.A.C. radio propram,
 
the script for which was written by Elizabeth Lomax, then Alan's wife.  I
 
honestly don't know the legal r
ights there, though I doubt anybody would hive
 
you any trouble.
 
A secon4 consideratior
. is that, as I say, this sons~ was a str.aigbt parody of
 
Lee E
iays  extretaely unusual version of
. "The State of Arkansas", w h
ich I
 
believe hos been registered as a c
lays cota
anosition.  I
f i
t hasn't been, it
 
should have been , i
t breathes much tore of Lee '
Rays that' the original folks.
 
Butch admired tae sono greatly, and got Lee's permission t
o do a parody, as
 
far as 1 know, but it really i
ts Lee's song in a
s sense.
 
Then .
.
,
.
_ believe It or not -
a there are two other consi.terations.  There is a
 
whole oth€
:r song '
`Diamond Joe", an enirratic whisper of just a few verses that
 
I think it on one of t
he Library of Congress' folt<
: music recordings.  That
 
song
; was where Elizabeth pot t
he i
dea of calling the rain character in her
 
play *
*Diamond Joe'.  Finally, unless my memory is completely skewed, you have
 
the words of Butch's piece* wrong.  I checked with Naomi and }
:ictF and they bot', 
remezber i
t differently too.  I have one copy of one of Butch's workings of the
 
song, and I could send you that, but what yo+
.: have here is pretty good -- I
 
suspect the classic processes of oral transmission have been at work on the
 
thin<t. and I
'd kind of l
iatex to freeze it in aspic.
 
I guess I :
.ave by nmy told you more than you warted to know about `
 Diarond Joe".
 
See what an innocent little requeot to put a verse of a song: into a banio manual
 
can do.  I
f I were you, I t
hins
+
. I
'd
 _
fust go ahead and use

Subject:  Evaluation of the Grey Eagles American Indian Dancers
 
Again, as a matter of policy, we cannot recommend these artists.  Though one
 
of the dancers, M
fr. Grey Eagle, may be considered a traditional dancer in his
 
own tribal (
Cherokee) style, the major portion of their presentation appears
 
to be a pan-tribal selection of some of the flashier Indian dances and
 
costumes, and, we feel, tends to reinforce misleading stereotypical perceptions
 
of Native Americans.

APPRENTICESHIPS
  
In his native homeland
. of Vietnam, Mr. Tam Vi They was considered to be among
_
 
the best musicians performing classical Vietnamese music.  He is a :
Waster of both
 
the don nguyet (
"moon lute") and the tranh (
a type of dulcimer), two classical
 
Vietnamese musical instruments.  In Western tradition, this would be analogous
 
to being
; a concert performer of both the classical guitar and the piano.
 
Following the war in Vietnam, Mr. Thuy fled from his country to the United
 
States, where his blindness, language limitations, and shortage of professional
 
performance opnortanities are a disadvantage in f
.indinF
, meaningful employment.
 
Fortunately for all concerned, four younger .
fellow refugees who aspire to
 
perform their own classical music found their way to Mr. Thuy's Vietnamese
 
community in northern Virginia.  All four--Tu Bui, Thanti Phiong Hua, Kim Oanh
 
Thi Nguyen, and Phoong My Thi Tran--have received Folk
.
. Arts apprenticeship
 
grants of $
1
.,500 each.  Mr. Thuy will have the opportunity to perform and
 
teach his music professionally, the four students will be able to study with
 
one of the beat Vietnamese masters, and a very special part of Vietnamese
 
culture will have the opportunity to continue for the benefit of both Vietnamese
 
immigrants in America and the American public in general.

(
Presentations  workshops)
 
A grant of $18,689 was awarded to North Country Community College in Saranac
 
Lake, New York for a series of workshops in Adirondack quideboat construction
 
taught by master traditional craftsmen Carl Hathaway and Ralph Morrow.  The
 
Adirondack guideboat, once a fixture within "camps" and resorts in the area,
 
is a traditional craft derived from the Native American canoe and the French
 
bateaux of Lake Champlain anal the St. Lawrence River.  The guideboat is, however,
 
no longer w14ely built due to the availability of less expensive commercially
 
produced craft and the continually decreasing number of skilled traditional
 
craftsmen capable of producing it.  The purpose of this grant, therefore, was
 
to insure the passage of necessary skills and expertise from two of the best
 
surviving guideboat builders to younger craftsworkers in the area, as well as
 
to provide direct support for the traditional artists still producing these
 
wonderful boats.  While classes have only recently begun, the initial response
 
to the project was overwhelming:  over fifty applications for the twelve
 
available places within the workshops, almost all from experienced woodworkers
 
with a deep intest in the Adirondack guideboat.  7n addition, the administration
 
of North Country Community College has been so delighted with the response that

the Folic Arts Program relies heavily upon the process of peer evaluation as
 
t

independent recommendations to the Chairman ensure that our grants-nak
_ing
 
;
process is both honorable and responsive to the current state of the arts.
 
The three year limitation on the tarn of any panelict is probably p
rise but
 
invariably hard on the program staff, who come to rely upon senior panel ists
 
for general advice and counsel.  As Program Director, 2 would like to may that
 
your contribution for the past three years has been exceptional, and it m
ates
 
the composition of this latter an especially difficult task.
 
As panel Chairman, you have taken on additional responsibilities, not only of
 
conducting the meetings but of consulting with ne on interim panel concerns of
 
all kinds.  I have also come to rely upon Fou for site visits during which you
 
have counselled prospective applicants wisely :
and evaluated ongoing projects
 
accurately and constructively.  I an delighted that you have consented to
 
continue Q this latter capacity as you can find time.  We will try not to
 
overload
. you.
 
Speakin; both for the Program staff and the ongoing panelists, thank you for
 
your wisdom, your fairness, and your dedication during your past three years

Here at long last is the little brochure describing the proxram I administer

about it by now, but we discussed it briefly in Washington at the AAA
 
meeting, after Connie Arensberq's speech when my brother, Alan Lovmx,
 
introduced us.
 
I Hope you have a chance to glance through it, and that, if you feel the
 
spirit, you will send us a critique.  I should greatly appreciate any
 
comaents you night find time to made.

Folk Arts recently sent staff vember Daniel Sheehy and ranclist Robert Garfias,
 
a Hispanic ethnomusicologist and Vice-Provost of the University of Washington,
 
on a week-long site visit to Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands.
 
I am attaching a copy of Dr. Garfiss' report for your general interest, but
 
want especially to draw your attention to pps. 14-15.  I
've received many
 
previous rumors that the situation C

any strategies we could employ?  Perhaps you and Dan could discuss this
 
during s

January 26.  I really think it is a scandal and one that should be addressed
 
in some fashion even if just to soothe our own consciences.
 
Until I get clearance from Dr. Garfins, I
'd want to keep his memo confidential,
 
so perhaps discretion s

Lear Mr. Madera:
 
It was a great pleasure having the opportunity to t
weet you at
 
the artesano awards ceremony during my recent stay in Pseato Rico.
 
I much ad
-mired the idea of rewarding the craftsmen with tools
 
for their outstanding cultural contributions to the people of
 
Puerto Rico and the artistic world at large.  Also, I was most
 
moved by the new spirit of cooperation among the :
wain govern-
ment institutions working for the common good of traditional
 
artists.  This kind of cooperative effort can only serve to
 
multiply the individual efforts many titres over.  I applaud
 
you for your leadership role in making this possible.
 
Also impressive were the successes of the energetic Walter Murray
 
Chiesa.  I have never seen a more diligent and dedicated govern-
ment representative.  I only hope that he will continue his
 
excellent work, and perhaps more importantly in the long run,
 
be able to train other persons like himself to carry on the
 
campaign after he retires.
 
I sincerely hope that we might be able to engage in some
 
joint activities in the futtre.  If I can be of any assistance
 
in any way, do not hesitate to contact me.
 
Cordially yours,
