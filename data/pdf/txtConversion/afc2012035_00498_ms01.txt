OZUKI SALON FIELD NOTES 
1025 Thomas Jefferson NW Suite 155, 
Washington, DC 20007 
 
 
 
I first spoke with Elizabeth Pierotti on the phone. She is the co-owner of Ozuki Salon 
located in Georgetown in Washington D.C. Elizabeth was extremely helpful. During our 
phone conversation she gave me a brief history about their business. Elizabeth is 
Caucasian and her husband, Iku Kawashita, is Japanese and also the head stylist at Ozuki. 
She said originally Ozuki was just a regular salon but they were struggling to survive so 
they decided to become a Japanese salon that catered to an Asian clientele. And that is 
when their business started to thrive.  
 
Elizabeth was extremely helpful. She asked most of her staff members to come into work 
about an hour before they opened for a group interview. I arrived at 9:45am. We sat in a 
circle and I set up the recording equipment on a table in the middle of the circle. Since I 
could not put a microphone on everyone, the audio quality suffered quite a bit. The short 
individual interviews were conducted in the back room of the salon and they were much 
better in terms of audio quality but since the stylists were working they had a limited 
amount of time to spend with me. I observed, photographed and conducted individual 
interviews until approximately 3:30pm.
