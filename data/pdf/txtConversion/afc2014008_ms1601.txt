n support of this application  I present the following (
I) detailed outline
 
of my p
lan of study, research, or travel and service to be performed during
 
the period of the l
eave; and (
2) statement of the resulting benefits which
 
w
ill accrue to the u
niversity and i
ts students.
 (
Attach additional sheets i
f
 
necessary.)
 
I propose to spend my sabbatical year, if granted, in the following
 
activities:
 
1
)  A three to six month period in New York City at the Cantometrics
 
and Choreometrics Research Project (affiliated with the Anthropology
 
Department of Columbia University and under the overall supervision of
 
its chairman, Prof. Conrad Arensberg).  This period of study and research
 
should serve to:
 
a) give me access to teaching materials, in the form of tape
 
recordings and films, unobtainable elsewhere, and
 
b) strengthen my teaching skills through additional training
 
in kinesic and musicological analysis.
 
2
)  A one to three month period at the University of Texas, where
 
I shall be setting into order the correspondence and field notes left
 
by my father (
the late John A. Lomax, folklorist) to the University
 
of Texas archives.  These materials are osentially unsorted; they
 
cover his forty years' experience collecting American folk songs, and
 
thus contain a vast amount of information important to further research
 
in this field.
 In their current condition, they are practically unusable;
 
I thus consider this rather onerous chore a contribution to future
 
scholarly research.
 
3
)  What portion of the year remains, I should like to spend completing
 
the manuscript of a book on American ritual traditions.  This work already
 
exists in first draft form, lacking only some additional research which
 
can be completed at the New York Public Library and the Library of Con—
 
gress during my New York stay.
 I am hoping to arrange to spend this
 
period of my sabbatical somewhere in the Caribbean, so that I can combine
 
the necessary editing and revising with field work in Black traditional
 
childrens' music, a topic on which I have already published.

 I agree to return to the service of
 
the California State Universities and render at l
east one term of service for
 
each term of  l
eave following my return from the l

I
n support of this request and pursuant w

ist of assets (the value of which i

the State of California against l

Description of Attachable Assets:
 (
Include the current balance i

fund account.)
 
I currently have a balance of $6,691.71 in my retirement fund account.
 
Dhould this not be considered a sufficient earnest, I also have part
 
equity in my home at 2522 24th Street, Santa Monica, California.  How-
ever, due to delays in settling the estate of my late husband (deceased
 
December 23, 1971), I cannot legally claim my equity at this time.
 I
 
am assured by my lawyer that the matter will be cleared within the
 
coming month.

Dear Mrs. Hawes:
 
This is an official confirmation of your appointment as a lecturer
 
(part-time) at the San Fernando Valley State College for the fall
 semester
 
of the t58_59 school year.
 The appointment is for one semester only.
 The
 
salary for this service is $183.20 per load unit (a load unit is a lecture
 
hour per week for a semester); laboratory and workshop hours are reduced to
 
lecture equivalents.
 This sum is approximate because the number of payroll
 
days varies slightly from semester to semester.
 You will receive each month
 
one sixth of the amount due you until your final month of service when the
 
balance of the total amount will be paid.
 
Prior to beginning service it is necessary for you to follow certain
 
procedures stipulated by State law: sign a loyalty oath, be fingerprinted,
 
and fill out income tax forms in the Personnel Office.
 If you have been
 
previously employed by the Los Angeles State College, it will not be
 
necessary for you to be fingerprinted again.  However, for part-time
 
personnel a new income tax form and new loyalty oath are necessary each
 
school year (but not each semester).
 
You should call for your paycheck at the Extended Day office on the
 
first working day of each month.
 
Appointments are contingent on enrollment and if sufficient numbers
 
do not enroll in any class to justify its maintenance,  the class will be
 
discontinued and this offer is withdrawn.
 
The faculty and administration welcome you as a member of the teaching
 
-aff of the college.  We look forward to a pleasant association with you
 
urinr the cor
nir
 semester,
 
Cordially,
 
Ralph Prator

o
r energy a

I
ncluding f

emonstrate the enthusia a and c
on-
s
istency of purpose which have marked her career here.
 
'
i
'
here are perhaps two points which i
nevitably '
arise f
or c
onsideration.
 
The nature of the s
pecial promotion indicates that i
t i
s being requested
 
)
efore the candidacy would be raised in the noinial t
ime period.  The
 
:
oimiiittee f
eels that while Mrs. Hawes may indeed be early i
n r
ank, t
i at
 
i
t i
s not early i
n terms of her total l
ength of service here.
 
The o
ther c
onsideration r
elates t
o the d
octoral d
egree.  At the beginning
 
of a career, the Ph.D. criterion i
s helpful f
or evaluation f
or lack of
 
other data, but in mid-career with the other materials available expressed
 
i
n t
erms of quality in t
eaching, University and professional work, i
t
 
night be c
onsidered that the Ph.D. i
s less the crucial criterion.  S
uch
 
would be the opinion then of this C
on ittee:  that the lack of the d
octorate
 
i
n the case of Mrs. Hawes i
s not t
o be c
onsidered a
s the primary i
ssue.

RECOMMENDATION ON SPECIAL PROMOTION FOR BESS LOMAX HAVES
 
After reviewing the dossier of Mrs. Bess Lomax Hawes and noting
 
in particular the progress she is making in her Graduate studies,
 
it is my pleasure to recommend that she be promoted to the rank
 
of Associate Professor contingent upon the successful completion
 
of the M
.A. degree prior to September 1
, 1
970.
 
in my personal Judgment, Mrs. Haves' distinguished record of
 
academic excellence and scholarly publication in the area of
 
Folklore in the field of Anthropology earns for her clear
 
promotion without any contingency.  However, since previous
 
recommendations (Dean Dance, February 1
, 1
967; Anthropology
 
Department Personnel Co m
mittee, November 1
, 1
968; Letters and
 
Science Personnel Committee, January 28, 1
968) have stipulated
 
that the M
.A. be required for promotion to the rank of
 
Associate Professor, I reluctantly place a degree contingency
 
on promotion.
 
A brief summary of Mrs. Haves' outstanding record now follows:
 
Her teaching excellence is unequivocal in that she earned a
 
Distinguished Professor Award in 1
968.  Her l
ist of papers read
 
at professional meetings, her published materials, and her films
 
are impressive in that they are capped by a book in press with
 
Harper and Row Step It Down and a newly released film Pizza
  
Pizza Daddy-O. She is now in her sixth year of rank as Assistant
 
Professor; her record is marked by continued productivity.

Dear Pauli

1970
 
As you may recall, when I decided to request that
 
I not be considered for promotion last fall,  I said that I
 
intended to bring my file up to date during the winter (1969-70)
 
as my various then-current projects neared completion.
 I
 
have recentlu sent you those documents and materials which
 
have become available to me up to this point in time, and
 
I should now like to ask that I be considered for promotion
 
this spring, if that is possible.
 
Cordially,
 
Bess Lomax Hawes

 I
R,  I 7O
 
I
 have received f
ro m Dean Sillars reco m mendations f
ro m the depart mental
 
and School l
evels regarding a special pro motion in your case.  Ordinarily,
 
I
 do not indicate to a proposed candidate for pro motion my negative
 
decision,  s
ince the publication of the na mes of those favorably acted upon
 
has been the accepted means of notification.  However, s
ince the reco m-
mendations in your case ca me to me after the established t
i me pattern for
 
pro motion consideration, I
 am providing you with individual notice as to my
 
decision.
 
In l
ight of the reco m mendations that have been made to me  I
 regret to
 
i
nfor m you that I
 am not acting favorably in regard to your advance ment
 
in rank a
t this t
i me.
 
I
t is my s
trong predisposition to accept the reco m mendations o
f the superior
 
faculty co m mittee in reaching my decision, unless I
 have personal knowledge
 
that would l
ead me to reject the reco m mendation.
 
I
 recognize there may be so me f
eeling that greatest credence should be
 
g
iven to the reco m mendations of depart mental co m mittees; however, I
 
understand that when the Personnel Planning and Review Co m mittee d
ivested
 
i
tself of the role o
f l
ooking a
t individual cases in the pro motion process, the
 
assu mption was that the School co m mittees would take the responsibility for
 
making the overall assess ment intended to insure equity and co mparability.
 
I
 hope you will understand the basis for my having reached the decision I
 
have in this matter.

Addendum:  Since in prior years I have announced two publications which
 
have not been forthcoming, I should l
ike to clarify their current status.
 
1
)  An article titled "La Llorona in Juvenile Hall" was accepted
 
two years ago for publication by Western Folklore, the j
ournal of the
 
California Folklore Society.  This summer I received a memorandum asking
 
me to order reprints from the University of California Press which puts
 
out the journal.  I have yet, however, to receive either the reprints
 
or an i
ssue of the journal containing the article.
 
2
)  My book manuscript "Step It Down" was accepted f
or
 
publication at Little Brown last fall; during the editorial revision,
 
the editor working on my manuscript resigned (I hope coincidentally).
 
The second editor and I did not agree, and the relationship was broken
 
off.  The manuscript is now at the University of Chicago Press where
 
i
t has received f
avorable attention, but I cannot claim to have
 
received more than encouragement.  They still hold the manuscript, but
 
have made no offer.

American Folklore Festival sponsored by the Smithsonian Institute.
 
(Washington, D. C.)  (
July 1
1-14,  1

an official memorandum from Governor John Connelly of Texas expressing
 
"our genuine gratitude for and great pride in the contributions of the
 
late John Avery Lomax and his children to the preservation of and
 
growing appreciation for America's folk songs and lore which
  
might well, without the tireless labors of this f
amily, have l
ong
 
since faded into oblivion."

To:  Dr. McMahon
 
From:  Bess Hawes
 
Vice-President Oviatt told me last spring that he had received
 
a number of letters relative to such matters as my teaching abili-
ty, my experience as a folklorist and so on.
 I had assumed that
 
copies of these letters would appear in my personnel folder, but
 
I understand that they are being retained (
I assume in Dr. Oviatt's
 
office) in view of the fact that they were not addressed to me
 
and that the writers might prefer that I not see them.
 
However, it occurs to me that these letters might contain s tate -
ments appropriate to the deliberations  of either the school or
 
the college personnel committee.  Would it be in order for you to
 
enquire as to the possibility of these letters being included in
 
my file when it leaves this office, so that they may be examined
 
by such committees as may be involved in consideration of my
 
tenure?

:
urrently being considered by Doubleday-Doran Publishers.  Dr.
 
;
alter A. Goldschmidt, chairman of the Department of Anthropology,
 
CLA, has read the manuscript and advised me verbally that, as
 
member of the editorial board of the University of California
 
ress, he would urge its acceptance by the Press in the event t
hat
 
oubleday rejected the manuscript.  I believe that Dr. Maurice
 
ance has spoken further with Dr. Goldschmidt on this matter.
 
) Read paper titled "La Liorona in Juvenile Hall: a study of the
 
syho-social adaptation of a Mexican legend" before the annual meeting
 
f the California Folklore Society at the University of California
 
:
t Davis, in April, 1966.  Dr. Albert B

copy of the paper for publication.
 It is currently being revised;
 
opies are available if requested.
 
) Invited to be a member of an advisory committee formed to aid
 
n the adjustment of the Carl Orff Schuiwerk music education method
 
:
o American educational institutions.  This committee has undertaken
 
n in-depth examination of American cultural expression and has
 
•
een at work for the past year; the work will continue for at leant

i
e year more.  Experimental studies are being carried out in the
 
ailf lower Unified School District; other members of the advisory
 
ommittee are: Dr. Dean Flower, Professor of Literature, USC;

r
. Richard Harsch, evaluation consultant, Los Angeles Board of
 
J
ucation; and Dr. Robert Haas, committee chairman, University E-
:
ension, UCLA.  In addition to meeting with the committee and pre-
aring reports for consideration, I have attended Schuiwerk demon-
trations, conducted one workshor for the training program and will
 
onduct another later this fall.
 
) Have applied to UCLA graduate division for advanced work in
 
T
nthropology, and have received approfal for graduate status from
 
r
. Walter Goldschmidt, chairman of the department of Anthropology.
 
recent communication from the graduate studies division, UCLA,
 
i
dicates that a failure of the Bryn Mawr College registrar to send
 
y transcript has held up formal acceptance.  Bryn Mawr informs me
 
;
hat the transcripts were duly sent as requested some months ago.
 
hey are currently sending new copies.  Hopefully, the matter can
 
;till be straightened out in time for me to und ertake graduate work
 
T
uring the winter c

)  Initiated and continued supervision of a research project by
 
t
hree students during the spring semester (and voluntarily over
 
the summer) to re-examine and re-state the problem of folklore
 
taxonomy.  A paper on the preliminary results of this project
 
was submitted by one of the students to a student folklore contest
 
s
ponsored by the Southern California Folklor e Soci ety, th e resu
lt s 
o
f which will be announced in January, 1967.  In the meantime, the
 
:ociety invited the student to read his paper at their fall meeting
 
(
tugust, 1966) at which time I introduced th e pro
jec t an d par
t
i ci-
pated in a full discussion of the problem of formal definitions
 
in this field.

Addendum:  Since in prior years I have announced two publications which
 
have not been forthcoming, I should l
ike to clarify their current status.
 
1
)  An article titled "La Llorona in Juvenile Hall" was accepted
 
two years ago for publication by Western Folklore, the journal of the
 
California Folklore Society.  This summer I received a memorandum asking
 
me to order reprints from the University of California Press which puts
 
out the journal.  I have yet, however, to receive either the reprints
 
or an issue of the journal containing the article.
 
2
)  My book manuscript "Step It Down" was accepted f
or
 
publication at Little Brown last fall; during the editorial revision,
 
the editor working on my manuscript resigned (I hope coincidentally).
 
The second editor and I did not agree, and the relationship was broken
 
off.  The manuscript is now at the University of Chicago Press where
 
i
t has received favorable attention, but I cannot claim to have
 
received more than encouragement.  They still hold the manuscript, but
 
have made no offer.
 
During the a
cademic year 1
967-68, in addition to my routine duties, I
 
engaged in the following activities:
 
Within the Department:
 
1
)  Acted as co-sponsor of the Anthropology Club
 
2
)  Acted as a member of the Library Committee
 
Within the College:
 
1
)  Guest speaker for the Viet Nam course sponsored by the
 
Experimental College.
 (March 14, 1
968)
 
2
)  Delivered three l
ectures f
or the "Project Learn" minority
 
students.
 (
Summer Session, 1
968)
 
Off-campus papers and talks:
 
1
)  Conducted a two-day seminar on f
olklore at Lewis and Clark
 
College (
Portland, Oregon) during which time I delivered six
 
l
ectures and showed SFVSC folklore films.
 (
See program attached)
 
2
)  Appeared as mistress of ceremonies, commentator and singer at
 
the Newport Folk Festival (
Newport, Rhode Island)(July 25-28, 1
968)
 
3
)  Received invitation to be "honored guest" at the second annual
 
American Folklore Festival sponsored by the Smithsonian Institute.
 
(Washington, D. C.) (
July 11-14, 1
968) At this occasion received
 
an official memorandum from Governor John Connelly of Texas expressing
 
"our genuine gratitude for and great pride in the contributions of the
 
late John Avery Lomax and his children to the preservation of and
 
growing appreciation for America's folk songs and l
ore which
  
might well, without the tireless labors of this f
amily, have l
ong
 
since faded into oblivion."

Dear Ralph:
 
You were n
't k
idding that this is a tough form to fill out.
 In trying to be
 
accurate, I ran across some recorded bits of my past, but a good bit of it
 
is scrappy and incomplete, I
'm afraid, and I really don't remember any more
 
than I put down.
 
I.
 
I left a few things out which you might want to put in for the sake t
-  total
 
completeness:
 
My first job (
immediately preceding the OWl) was as private
 
secretary assistant to Carleton Sprague Smith, Head of the Music Division,
 
New York Public L
ibrary.
 I worked for him for a year -
 1941-2 -
 as I recall
 
and pulled down $25.00 a week.
 
Z
.a I have also taught odd courses here and there:
 
4.From 1961-66 at Idywliwild Arts Foundation, Idyiwild, California:
 
two-week summer workshops in folk music; during this period the Foundation
 
became a campus of the University of Southern California and the works Mp
 
a course with credit at USC.
 
b
.  At Los Angeles State College, I taught a night course in American
 
Folk Music in the Music Department for a year (
1962-3).  My title was Instructor.
 
I haven't the least notion what I was paid.
 
c
.
 In the summer of 1970, I taught two courses for the Institute for
 
Folklore and Mythology at the University of California at Los Angeles.  My
 
title was Lecturer; again, I don't know what I was paid.
 
A more important addition is a section from my vita which I have xeroxed titled
 
"Consultantships and research affiliations".
 It should be added, I should think,
 
under #21, but I used up all the space.
 
Lastly, I did not fill in the sections 15,  1
6 and 17, s
ince I did not know if
 
you were putting this in for the WAE position we discussed with Jim or the
 
full-time position we talked of over the phone, or both.
 I would think you
 
could check that off properly depending on the circumstances.
 
I am sorry to have taken so long over this.
 I also hope I have f
illed in enough
 
information to get by; I really haven't kept miniscule records of my past.
 
All the best,
