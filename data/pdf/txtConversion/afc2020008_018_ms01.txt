Dominic Ninni interviewed by Vyta Pivo on May 26, 2021 at the Lehigh Cement Company 
Plant in Evansville, Pennsylvania. The interview transcript has been edited for clarity.  
 
[00:00:00] 
 
Vyta Pivo: 
Today is Wednesday, May 26, 2021. This is an interview for the occupation 
History Archive, which is part of the Folklife Center at the Library of Congress. As part of this 
project, I am interviewing some workers in the Lehigh Valley, Pennsylvania, the birthplace of 
the modern cement industry in the United States. The recording and transcript will become part 
of the permanent collection at the Library of Congress. I am Vyta Pivo and today I am speaking 
with Dominic Ninni here at the Lehigh Cement Company Plant in Evansville, Pennsylvania. 
And just to confirm, you give me your permission to record the interview?  
 
Dominic Ninni: 
Yes.  
 
VP: 
Thank you so much. Um, so could you tell me your full name, your year of birth and 
where you were born? 
 
DN: 
Full name is Dominic Michael Ninni, year of birth 1990, and what was the third 
question?  
 
VP: 
Where you were born.  
 
DN: 
Redding, Pennsylvania.  
 
VP: 
So just around the corner?  
 
DN: 
Yeah. Yeah.  
 
VP: 
Is that where you grew up?  
 
DN: 
Yes, I grew up just outside Redding, Old Lehigh Valley, um, probably 15 minutes 
outside the city, farm country.  
 
VP: 
So, when did you first learn about cement?  
 
[00:01:24] 
 
DN: 
I've actually known about cement almost my whole life. Actually, my father worked 
here for 30 years, so he's worked here. He actually started as a laborer, I think in 1992, I want 
to say. Um, and he's been working here ever since. He's had multiple jobs through the union 
side and the hourly side, and now he's a production supervisor. Um, so I've kind of known 
about cement, yeah, basically my entire life.  
 
VP: 
Do you remember coming to visit your dad at work?  
 
DN: 
I did, yeah. Back then it was a little bit different as it is now, there's kind of more safety 
rules and things like that. But before you could come to the plant and, you know, like we'd 
2 
 
bring him lunch sometimes and things like that, we also had company picnics, um, and we still 
have those things now, obviously different with the Covid stuff. But, um, yeah, I remember 
coming here as a little kid and stuff and uh. Yeah. So, it's kind of been a part of my life, my 
entire life.  
 
VP: 
What did you think about the plant when you would come to visit?  
 
DN: 
Um, it was huge. When I was a kid, it was very big. I mean it's still big now, but yeah, 
um, I never really knew, uh, that much went into making cement before, you know, growing 
up. I never knew it was such a process, really.  
 
VP: 
But what were the company picnics like?  
 
DN: 
Um, they were good. They were there over at a little um, I forget the name of it, it’s 
over at Bland and it's like a little park outside and they would have raffles and, uh, food and 
everybody would go to it. And there's me being younger kid there, there's guys I work with 
now that we're kids with me, uh, then too. So, it's kind of like a big family, cement family 
reunion there, I guess you'd say.  
 
VP: 
Did you at all like have activities to, like, learn about cement?  
 
DN: 
Um, not at the company picnics, really. They were more like just hanging out outside 
of the workplace. But, um, they didn't have any like, uh, you know, educational stuff there. It 
was mainly just food and family and fun.  
 
VP: 
So, when did you start to think about joining the industry yourself?  
 
[00:03:51] 
 
DN: 
Um, well, I actually, uh, had was in college and I was kind of deciding what I was going 
to do with, uh, with my career as I started to get out, get ready to get out of college. And my 
dad had told me that they were hiring summer help laborers here and it was good pay and it 
was going to help me pay for school when I was, you know, into my senior year. And so, I 
started here doing that as a summer help laborer. And through that, I had, uh, you know, was 
getting ready to graduate. And I actually have my degree in criminal justice, not even cement-
related, but I was looking for a job. This is back in 2013 or 2012-2013. I was looking for a, uh, 
looking for a job in police work and it was kind of hard to find at the time. And you go to a, 
you go to you know, an Allentown police department would be hiring two police officers and 
there'd be 300 people there. So, it was kind of tough to find a job at that point. So, um, I had 
found out through my dad they were hiring full time here. And this is after I had done summer 
help labor. So, I got hired on as a full-time laborer, and that was, I want to say the end of 
2014/2015, and so I got hired as a full-time laborer and it was tough. The, I mean, the 
environment's tough, temperatures and the dust and things like that. And I really wasn't sure 
was what I wanted to do. And so, I stuck it out, was really good pay, really good benefits. Um, 
so, you know, the company made it worth it. And I eventually was stayed on and shipping 
supervisor position came open. And so, I applied for that and I had come into the interview for 
it and I didn't get that initially, that job they had one of the main supervisors that was already a 
supervisor had gotten it. But my interview went well and they had said, you know, if there's 
any other supervisory positions come up that, you know, to apply for it. And then so I stayed 
on the labor in the labor department and production and eventually the labor supervisor job 
3 
 
came up. So, I applied for that and I got it. And I was the labor supervisor for about two years. 
And then I filled in during that time, um, as a production supervisor and the labor supervisor. 
Um, and then eventually from there, the job I have now, which is a plant buyer, that position 
came open and I kind of wanted to get more into the purchasing side and aspect of it as opposed 
to the production side, because I spent the first four years in the production side here and it's, 
you know, it's dusty and dirty and I wanted to, I kind of was attracted to the purchasing side of 
it. So, the job that I have now, plant buyer, came open. I applied for that and I got hired and 
I've been in that position ever since. So, yeah, currently I'm the senior plant buyer.  
 
VP: 
Can you tell me a little bit about what the summer help job entailed, what you did as 
part of that work?  
 
[00:07:27] 
 
DN: 
Oh, yeah. So, summer help labor basically it’s just labor work. You're shoveling a lot, 
wheelbarrowing, sweeping, um, operating equipment as far as forklift skid loaders, things like 
that. Um, there's a lot of, like, confined space in the plant. So, you need to do, like, like hole 
watch or, you know, fire watch if you're doing hot work. Um, so it's multiple jobs, but mainly 
like the majority of it is just straight labor work, shoveling, wheelbarrowing. Um, there's a lot 
of spillage of belting when you make cement, so a lot of piles and we're governed by MSHA, 
so, it's uh, you know, it's trying to keep walkways safe and clear and it's a lot of cleaning.  
 
VP: 
Did you work as part of a team?  
 
DN: 
Yeah, there was, I think when I got hired, there was probably, I want to say five or six 
of us as summer laborers. And we were all wet with a full-time laborer. Um, we never were 
alone in the plant. Um, and we’d go to different job sites. So, it's probably, they'd split us 
sometimes, you know, three or three or four, you know. And so, we usually work with 
somebody. Yeah.  
 
VP: 
What's surprised about that work when you started?  
 
[00:08:56] 
 
DN: 
Um, the most surprising thing probably was some of the temperatures in the area we're 
working on were really hot. Um, and then a lot of it, too, was the dust, some of the dust and the 
reaction it has with your sweat and on your skin can get here tating and cause rashing. And 
then some of that I didn't really know going into it. Um, and then also a lot of the confined 
space stuff, I didn't know much about that. That was surprising to me that, you know, if you go 
in certain equipment, there has to be somebody there to watch you the entire time you're 
working in there. So, uh, in case anything would happen.  
 
VP: 
So, what are some of those cases? Could you give an example? 
 
DN: 
Um, yeah. So, like are finished mills where the cement, the finished powder gets 
crushed in the finish mill. Um, any time there's work that has to be done in there, it's obviously 
not meant for human occupation in there. So, you have to have the guys who crawl in and work 
in there. And while they're in there, you'll just basically stand at the hole that they enter with, 
it's called the sniffer, and it detects any kinds of gases in the air or anything like that, and then 
4 
 
you just write down the numbers, you get off the digital sniffer and just make sure, you know, 
nobody passes out or the temperature is OK or anything like that. Yeah.  
 
VP: 
What was your schedule like?  
 
DN: 
Monday through Friday, 7 AM-3 PM. Yeah.  
 
VP: 
Did you like working with the other coworkers?  
 
DN: 
 Yeah. Yeah, it was a lot of, uh, it's a lot of family members. So, like, it's a lot of times 
it's people you already know. Um, they hire family here a lot. So, uh, you know, one of the 
girls that worked as a summer help laborer, her dad had worked here. So, I knew her and I went 
to school with her sister and, um, a couple of the other guys I had already known. They went 
to other local schools in the area and but yeah, they were good crew.  
 
VP: 
Does that does that familiarity of the folks working with you make the job easier or a 
bit harder or...?  
 
DN: 
Um, I would say probably easier because you're more comfortable and you also have 
to have a certain amount of trust with the people you're working with, too, just because some 
of the areas can get a little hairy safety-wise. And, um, especially, like I said, with the 
temperatures and some of the certain things in different areas, you want to make sure, you 
know, you have somebody there that, you know, will also be, you know, working with you to 
get the job done because you want to get out of there if it's really bad. And, you know, just 
knowing that they are also, you know, working smart. Yeah, it's better, I feel like when you 
know who you're working with. 
 
VP: 
Were there jobs that you’re just like, oh no, not again? 
 
[00:11:58] 
 
DN: 
Yeah. There’s, so we have inside the finished mill there's a screen, there's two, uh, 
there's basically two sections of the finished mill and then there's a screen in the middle and 
that screen in the middle keeps some of the, uh, like small material from going through into the 
end of the second compartment. And every once in a while we have to go in there and clean 
that screen out and there's like a little metal balls and all kinds of washers and things will be 
stuck in those screens. And when they take the mill down, it has to be down for a certain amount 
of time before any human occupants can go on it because it's so hot. But when you go in there 
and it's technically clear to go in, it's still hot. So, cleaning the screens inside the mill, that was 
the job that I did not thoroughly enjoy just because of the temperature. And the work is tough 
to, sometimes we have a little air chisels to get them out. If you couldn't use their chisels, you 
have to use pry bars and then they shoot out. And so, it was, yeah, that wasn't one of the 
favorites for anybody.  
 
VP: 
How often would you have to do that?  
 
DN: 
Um, it depends. It's really up to the mill engineers. But, um, I would say it's probably 
like once or twice a month maybe max. Yeah.  
 
VP: 
So, it seems like the labor worker experience gave you a perspective on the whole plant.  
5 
 
 
DN: 
It does. It's actually a great starting point, I think, because you put in so many different 
areas and when you're, you go to a certain area, a lot of the other hourly employees and 
supervisors that work in that area give you a good description of how everything's operating so 
you can work safely. You know, you'll get, like if you have to clean under a belt, um, they'll 
tell you, ok, you have to lock this belt out and lock this belt out because this is running to this. 
And so, you’re going to get a good understanding and you get sent all over the plant. So, you 
get a huge understanding of all different areas in the plant as opposed to, you know, sometimes 
a mill operator is only in the mills and he's not held back by, like, the kilns. So, you kind of 
get, you get a taste of different areas every day, which is good for building experience.  
 
VP: 
Were there particular sections that you really liked that you wanted to go into?  
 
DN: 
Um, the mill building wasn't my favorite, very dusty in there, um, and hot. Uh, I would 
say probably on top of the silos. I always like the cleaning on top of the silos because they're 
150 feet up and you can kind of see the whole plan and it's you get a good breeze up there. You 
can see down into the quarry, which is pretty cool. Um, so yeah I would say probably on top 
of the silo, that’s always good place to work when it's a nice day out, too. It was nice.  
 
VP: 
Did you ever feel like, um, you know, you were in college then you're coming to the 
plant and, like, cleaning out like in this heat. Were you ever kind of annoyed?  
 
DN: 
Yeah. I mean, it has its days when you just didn't feel like doing it. Some days you'd be 
down, the worst area you could go as a laborers is called the pan conveyor, which is like the 
hot clinker comes out from the kiln, it goes into a cooler and then onto this pan conveyor. And 
it's very, very hot there and very, very dusty. And that's where that dust bowl burn your skin. 
And so, some days you be like, oh, you know, I really don't feel like going down there. And 
you got to go down and you got to wear extra layers because you don't want the dust on your 
skin. And it's then you're out, you're sweating because it's so hot. So, it's like a lose-lose. But 
yeah, definitely had its days where you were like, I don't want to go there.  
 
VP: 
So, did you ever feel like kind of, sort of rebellious treatment from the, like, older folks 
who were just like, oh, this young kid from college coming in?  
 
DN: 
Yeah, you kind of get that vibe. You know, there's not a lot of these guys, you know, 
aren't college educated. They have just worked here. You know, it was a different day back 
then when they started. They worked here since they were 18, 19, you know, 20 years old. And 
this is all they have known. And so, they have a ton of knowledge. And you kind of come in as 
a, you know, college kid and it's like, you know, you can't hack it here. So, yeah, you get that 
on occasion for sure. Yeah.  
 
VP: 
So, do you feel like it takes like a little bit more effort for you to get accepted?  
 
[00:16:40] 
 
DN: 
Yeah, a little bit. I think it was easier for me just because my dad had worked here so 
long and he's a super nice guy, well respected, too. So, that kind of helped me when I came in 
to get, you know, a little more respect from the hourly guys. And then I would think, you know, 
other people who either didn't know anybody here or, you know, knew somebody different. 
But I think that really helped me have a great, gain a little more respect, like, you know. But 
6 
 
you definitely have to earn it. You definitely have to get put in those tough environments and 
show you can hack it, for sure.  
 
VP: 
So, did any of the other laborers who started with stayed on or? 
 
DN: 
Um, as far as summer help?  
 
DN: 
I don't think so. I don't think so. Um, now, when I got hired full time as a full time 
laborer, uh, I think all those guys might still be here except for one. I didn't think that was for 
I want to say four of us maybe. But as far as summer help goes, I don't think anybody else 
stayed on from that group.  
 
VP: 
So, what do you think makes people stay working of the in the industry?  
 
[00:17:53] 
 
DN: 
Um, I think the pay is really good to pay. The benefits are really good. Um, and as far 
as know, speaking for this plant, it's, uh, it's good in the sense that you go you know, your 
supervisor gives you your job and you go and basically you do your work and they'll come up 
and check on you and, you know, making sure that you're doing what you're supposed to be 
doing and things like that. But it's really, like they know how tough some of the environments 
can be. So, it's like, you know, job done, but, you know, you still got to get your job done and 
complete. But it's not like, you know, it's not like, OK, this is an assembly line. You got to be 
here at this time and you can't know it's for this plant, I would say, the environment’s good and 
the culture I see. But I think the main attraction and manufacturing in general is the pay and 
benefits are really good. Um, and, you know, I think a lot of the guys here especially too like, 
take pride in making the cement here and, you know, it's cement used all over the place. So, 
it's kind of when you get that instilled in you and you realize how crucial cement is to the 
country, it's pretty cool.  
 
VP: 
And describe what you do now in your position?  
 
[00:19:14] 
 
DN: 
Oh, yeah. So now, um, I do procurement, so basically I buy all the parts for the plant, 
uh, rental equipment, uh, any kind of, like, mobile equipment we'll use. Um, so we have an 
inventory like roughly around 8 thousand parts and, uh, they range from belt conveyors, 
sprockets, um, bearings, rollers, all kinds of, all kinds of equipment. And, basically I just, we 
have an hourly employee that will do inventory, so we do inventory together. So, we inventory 
all the parts, we reorder all the parts, and make sure we're stocked. And then we order, you 
know, special parts for, like, winter repairs. And, uh, and then we also, I'll work with rental 
companies on getting equipment in here and purchasing mobile equipment also not just renting 
it.  
 
VP: 
So, does that mean that you don't get out into the plant very much?  
 
DN: 
I do on occasion. Sometimes if there's a special like, if there's something that we don't 
normally stock, I'll have to go out to a job and look and say, OK, we need this and it fits here 
and this is what it is. And, you know, I work really closely with the maintenance department 
on that. So, if there's something that we don't stock and we need to, you know, locate it to make 
7 
 
sure, you know, I'm getting the right stuff, I go out in the plant, but definitely not as much as I 
used to being in the production department, you know. I spend most of my time on the phone, 
procuring.  
 
VP: 
So, what do you think prepared you most for this position?  
 
[00:21:01] 
 
DN: 
Um, well, I have a really good supervisor in this position because I can say I. I really 
didn't know much about it on the hourly side, I had filled in, um, in the store house, which is 
the hourly position for basically just receiving parts that come in and keeping track of 
inventory. And so, I knew a little bit about it, but when I had wanted to get into it, I talked to 
my current supervisor now and, about doing it, and he gave me a lot of guidance and a lot of 
instruction and a lot of knowledge because he had done it for so many years. So, I think he 
really prepared me for what I was getting into very well. And then also just kind of like, you 
know, studying on my own, you know, making sure I knew. And the company offers a lot of 
trainings and a lot of online learning and things like that, so. But one of the major things that 
helped me was honestly just starting from a laborer and working my way up to this position 
and just knowing the plant, you know, having a knowledge of the plant really helps a lot, too.  
 
VP: 
Are there particular parts of the plant that break down on a regular basis, so there’s a 
kind of cycle or schedule for replacing parts?  
 
DN: 
Um, so we do have a system, a charge out system. So, when parts do that, we get 
charged out, they come up in the computer system for automatic reorder. And then basically 
when they come up for automatic reorder, I'll take those and I'll shoot it out to get quoted to 
different companies and then, you know, we'll end up purchasing it and restocking it. Um, but 
as far as, I feel, I think belting is probably one of the things that we, belting and mobile 
equipment are two of the bigger things that we spend more money than anything, I would think.  
 
VP: 
And you mentioned you have like there are some opportunities for you to study a little 
bit extra, but what are some of the additional skills or additional knowledge that you feel like 
you would benefit from?  
 
DN: 
Um, as far as being out in the plant and taking them over to the job I have now. 
 
VP: 
No, your current job, you mentioned there’s training.  
 
DN: 
Oh, yeah. So, some of the training will have online is basically kind of like negotiating 
classes, like you negotiate pricing a lot in the job I have now. So, the kind of like negotiating 
classes, I went to a few of those, um, and then there's just training in general, just the overall 
process of, you know, the manufacturing of the cement, which really is crucial because that's 
when you get an understanding of, you know, when you're buying stuff, you want to buy good 
stuff, not cheap stuff. So, it kind of gives you an understanding of, OK, you know, we want 
this. And, you’ll know what is good and bad just because you've seen what's good and bad out 
in the plant.  
 
VP: 
So, could you tell me what you're a typical day at work looks like?  
 
[00:24:07] 
8 
 
 
DN: 
Oh, yeah. So, I come in, you see about 6-6:15 in the morning and we have a 6:30 
basically appreciate meeting with all the supervisors. So, maintenance, um, purchasing myself, 
um, electrical, and the production department. And we just go over what we're going to do 
through the day. And then when that meeting ends, usually the hourly guys are showing up 
around 7 AM and we do a safety meeting. Every morning, we do a safety talk and that's sent 
out by the safety manager. So, he'll send out different topics to discuss in the morning. And 
that's about 15-20 minutes. We do that. And then once we do a safety meeting, um, I usually 
go through the system and I'll check my emails first because I usually have a lot of those, um, 
and then I'll go through the system and see what came up for the order from the previous day. 
And start sending items out to be quoted. And then throughout the day, a lot of different stuff 
pops up, a lot of random stuff. So, you know, a piece of rental equipment will break down and 
will have to contact the rental company to come out and repair it. A lot of different, if a 
breakdown happens, then we have, you know, an emergency where we'll have to get parts 
rushed in. And you're doing research on trying to get the right stuff in quickly and call on 
different vendors to see who has what and where it's stocked and things like that. And then and 
in that, I mean, that's really the whole day it’s just kind of checking the system for reordering 
and then dealing with breakdowns in the plan and making sure. And then we have a couple of 
meetings and that where we discuss, like, we have a lot of planned work discussing getting, 
you know, high dollar items. And so, then we have, like, that's like 1:30 we have that meeting. 
So, but that's basically the day is getting stuff quoted and getting it here, so we're prepared for 
a breakdown or anything.  
 
VP: 
When do you typically leave work? 
 
DN: 
 Around 3-3:30, yeah.  
 
DN: 
Yeah.  
 
VP: 
And, are you kind of I, I assume you have a company phone.  
 
DN: 
Yes, I have a cell phone.  
 
VP: 
Do you get calls after work? 
 
DN: 
So, like if we have an afterhours delivery because the guy that I supervise is usually the 
one to unload deliveries as they come in. And so, they'll call me sometimes for that. And if 
there's a driver that shows up after hours and then I'll just call the plant and have them send in 
a forklift operator down because there's somebody here 24/7, so. I also handle the elevators 
throughout the plant. So, if we have an emergency with any of the plant elevators, I have to get 
in contact with company to get the elevators back up and running and things like that. And that 
happens a lot after hours. And then sometimes you just have breakdowns after hours that we 
need to get rush stuff in. And I just have to make a lot of phone calls from home.  
 
VP: 
So, would you say that developing relationships with the other companies, the suppliers, 
is important?  
 
[00:27:39] 
 
9 
 
DN: 
You know, and I always view I think back in the day was kind of always viewed as, 
you know, negotiate real hard and try and get the lowest price you can. Now, I think it's flowing 
a little bit more towards, you know, for both of us to succeed, we need to work together. So, 
you definitely want to have a good relationship with these companies. And, you know, because 
we rely on them, they rely on us, so. And we do, we have a lot of sales guys who come in from 
different companies and we also have national contracts with companies we have to use. So, 
um, there's some of that. But for the most part, the we do a pretty good job of vetting the 
companies that we use here. And we have good relationships with them, especially the ones 
we have national contracts with. They we have good relationships with.  
 
VP: 
Why do you have to use particular companies for the national contract?  
 
DN: 
Uh, well, because the, uh, they've signed a national contract to use them. So, it's and it's 
not, like, 100 percent have to it's if we need a certain item, we go to them and but we still send 
it out to get quoted through other places. And now usually when we have a national contract, 
somebody we have preferred pricing. So, you know, it usually goes to them anyway. But it's 
just, uh, um, a lot of companies I know don't do national contracts much, very, very often 
anymore. But we have it with a few rental companies. Um, but if they don't have what we need 
or can't get it in a timely manner and, uh, we go to somebody else, you know, that's just the 
way we need it.  
 
VP: 
And you mentioned this for a particular parts?  
 
DN: 
Yeah. For certain things. So, a lot of this like bearings and belts and things like that will 
go to a certain company. The rental equipment will go to a certain company. And like I said, 
we still send it out to get quoted through different vendors. But, usually we get preferred pricing 
through national contracts.  
 
VP: 
Are many of the suppliers local or regional?  
 
DN: 
Yeah, a lot of them are local. Yeah. Um, a lot of them are bigger companies so they’re, 
but they local, uh, local locations. But we do use like a lot of local small mom and pop shops 
too in the area.  
 
VP: 
Do you have any international suppliers?  
 
DN: 
Um, yeah, we do, um, kind of think of certain ones that we use quite often, but we 
definitely have do, um. For a little for a lot of the different parts, there's a lot of companies that 
do a lot of, like weird parts you wouldn't even think of, you know, that are overseas, that we 
get shipped in from, like, from Spain and Italy and Germany, a lot in Germany.  
 
VP: 
Do you have an examples? 
 
DN: 
 So, um, yeah, I'm trying to think of the one that we use for so like Lincoln is one that 
we use and they make these lube pumps for our mills and they come from Germany. So, like I 
think they were bought out by SKF. I think, um, they're one that they come from Germany. A 
lot of our separator parts and stuff come from Spain. Um, F.L. Schmidt is one of our big 
suppliers.  
 
VP: 
What would you say is the most challenging part of your job?  
10 
 
 
[00:31:13] 
 
DN: 
Um, for me personally is I don't like when things aren't in my control. And when you're 
ordering stuff and there's logistics involved in it, a lot of it is outside your control. Um, and 
when you're trying to get stuff here and, you know, you have a lot of supervisors and managers 
waiting for things to come in, either for the plant to run or to fix a certain thing that can be 
frustrating is just trying to fight through, especially with the pandemic. Uh, logistics sometimes 
can be a nightmare, so. That's probably the biggest downside, for me personally, I don't like to 
not be able to control it. So, you know, waiting on other people is the toughest thing for me. 
But, yeah.  
 
VP: 
Can you tell me a little bit about how the pandemic has impacted your work?  
 
[00:32:01] 
 
DN: 
Um, yeah, well, pricing for sure for some stuff. I mean, we use a, well we used a lot of 
like plywood when we dump mills and stuff and obviously the price of lumber skyrocketed. 
So, that was that affected us decently. Um, and then it's just a lot of, you know, businesses 
being shut down and trying to catch up. We've also have some filters that we get, uh, for some 
of our motors that are made with the same material as respirators. So, they were on a long, 
long, long backorder because obviously our motor filters aren't as important as respirators were 
during the pandemic. So, it affected us a couple of different areas that were random, you 
wouldn't really think about it. Yeah, lumber was one, the material for the for the respirators 
was another one and then just the overall logistics. Right now I know trucking is a big one. It's 
hard to find trucking, um, for some of our raw materials, but.  
 
VP: 
What would you say is your favorite part of your job? 
 
DN: 
I would say my favorite part of my job is probably that I get to do a lot of different 
things. You know, I'm not just stuck in one lane, really. I do a lot of different things throughout 
the plant, which I really like, you know. I work really closely with the maintenance department 
and the production department. And I would, that's probably my favorite is just working closely 
with each department and then being able to, uh, you know, it's nice when you can get stuff 
here to make sure we stay running and continue running.  
 
VP: 
Do you see yourself working in the cement industry in the future?  
 
DN: 
Yeah, I hope so. This is like I said, I had started here as summer help. And I really, the 
company has afforded me huge opportunities to move up and quickly too, you know, so I 
definitely would like to continue to move up in, uh, you know, in this company for sure. But 
even if it wouldn't be in this role and in purchasing if it was in another one, the either or I love 
the purchasing department, so I'm really focusing on that. And but the company offers so many 
opportunities and it's such a big company that, yeah, I definitely see myself to continue working 
in the cement industry for sure.  
 
VP: 
Are you, uh, at all interested in going to Germany or kind of swimming in international 
waters to see what it’s like?  
 
11 
 
DN: 
Um, I would be, but unfortunately I'm married, not unfortunately married. No, my wife 
is an eye doctor, so she has her own practice in the Berks County area. So, we have kind of 
some roots planted. So, I don't know how much relocating I'd be able to do, but it would 
definitely be a cool experience to go check that out, though, you know, for a period of time, I 
don't know if I long term, I could do it.  
 
VP: 
So, in closing out the interview, is there something that I haven't asked you about or 
something you'd like to kind of comment on? 
 
[00:35:20] 
 
DN: 
Off the top of my head I'm not sure of anything. For anybody that's not, uh, you know, 
familiar with the cement industry, it's kind of, it's kind of a neat thing to see. And I didn't know 
being outside of it until I got in the complexities that are involved in actually making cement. 
You know, you kind of think of, what is it, Flintstones where they just smash a rock and you 
know, but it's not that simple and it's uh, some of the complexities involved in it are pretty 
crazy and it can be a tough environment. But you know, it's very important for the country 
obviously, and it's a huge commodity. So, um just, uh. Yeah. For anybody who doesn't know 
and is interested to check it out  
 
VP: 
What do you think of the, uh, kind of a major misconception or a missing kind of 
knowledge about the cement industry from the general public?  
 
DN: 
Probably that it's just as simple as crushing rock.  
 
VP: 
And is that what your friends think you do?  
 
DN: 
Yeah, yeah. There's a, you know, there's a lot of, uh, smart people involved here and 
they really make a good quality product. And I think that's what helps our plant stand out a lot, 
so. You know, there's good you know, people who purchase our cement, like the strength and 
the color. And there's a lot of smart people working here to make sure that we continually 
produce high quality cement, so.  
 
VP: 
Awesome. Well, thank you so much.  
 
DN: 
Thank you.
