PADDY- IS-THE- BOY SONGSTER. 
PADDY IS THE BOY. 
A Popular Irish Song. 
It's some years ago, I 
very well know, 
Since I 
first saw daylight with my two blessed- 
eyes! 
I 
was born, so they say, when my dad was away, 
On St. Patrick's day, in the morning. 
How they nursed me with joy, said : whata fine boy! 
Put a 
stick in my fist, by the way of a 
toy: 
Faith! there's no mistake, they admired my make, 
,And said some day I'd give the girls a 
warming. 
Chorus. 
For Paddy is the boy that's fond of a 
glass! 
Paddy is the boy that's fond of a 
lass! 
.Dear Old Dublin is the place for me, 
And Donnybrook is the place to go for a 
spree! 
At a 
wake or a 
fair, poor Paddy is there; 
He will fight foe or friend, if they do him offend; -1' 
Let the piper strike up — he will rise from his cup: 
With a 
smile on his face adorning, 
With his little Colleen he'll dance on'the green 
Sure, an Irishman, there, in his glory was seen: 
Play a 
reel or a 
jig, he don't care a 
fig; 
But he'll dance till daylight, in the morning. 
Chorus.

PAT MALLOY. 
Now, boys, do you mind: you never will find 
Such a 
dear little place as the Emerald Isle; 
Long, loner '' 
may it stand, and (rood luck to the l
and 
That dear Old St. Patrick was born in! 
May the girls, young and old, may the boys, brave 
and bold, 
Unite, heart and hand, to protect the dear Isle! 
And, morn, noon, and night, may joy. and delight 
Shine on them, like a 
fine summer's morning! 
Chorus. 
PAT MALLOY. 
IThe music of this song can be obtained at the welbknown 
Music Store of War. A. Pox D & CO., 547 Broadway, New York.] 
.At sixteen years of age I 
was my mother's fair-
haired boy; 
She kept a 
little huckster shop, her name it was 
Malloy. 
I've fourteen children, Pat, says she, which heaven 
to me has sent; 
But ender ain't like pigs, you know; they can't pay 
• the rent! 
She gave me ey'ry shilling there was In the till, 
And kissed me fifty thnes or more, as if she'd never 
get her fill: 
Oh, heaven bless you! Pat, says she, and don't for-
get, my boy, 
That: Ould Ireland is your country, and your name 
is Pat Malloy! 
Oh! England is a 
purty place: of g-oold there is no 
lack. 
I 
trudged from York to London wid me scythe upon 
me back. 
The English girls are beautiful, their loves I 
don't 
decline; 
FELLX McCARTY. 
The eating and the drinking, too, is beautiful and 
fine; 
But in a 
corner of me heart, which nobody can see, 
Two eyes of Irish blue are always peeping out at 
Me! 
Oh Molly, darlin', never fear: I'm still your own dear 
boy. 
Ould Ireland is me country, and me name is Pat 
Malloy! 
From Ireland to America, across the seas, I 
roam: 
And every shilling that I 
got, alt! sure I 
sent it 
home. 
Me mother couldn't write, but, oh! there came from 
Father Boyce: 
Oh! Heaven bless you! Pat, says she 
I 
hear me 
mother's voice! 
But, now, Pm going home again, as poor as I 
began, 
To make a 
happy girl of Moll, and sure I 
think lean; 
Me pockets they are empty, but me heart is filled wid 
joy: 
For, Ould Ireland is me country, and me name is 
Pat Malloy! 
FELIX McCARTY.

" Robinson Crusoe." 
Hould yer whist, if yer•can ' and I'll sing of a 
man, 
Ah Irishman healthy and hearty, 
A 
great politician — you shouldn't be missing 
The friendship of Felix McCarty. 
Chorus. 
Then hurrah for bold Felix McCarty, 
The pride of the Dimecrat party; 
He lived in the Sixth Ward, and the divil a 
word 
Could be said agin Felix McCarty.

PAT MALLOY'S RETUR: 
TO IRELAND. 
He done all the fighting, and took great delight in 
The men that belonged to his party; 
If you'd dare raise your voice agin the man of his 
choice, • 
You'd soon hear from bold Felix McCarty.

Now, one ov those days, when he makes a

We'll elect the bould Felix McCarty.

Alit — " The Captain with the Whiskers." 
When landed safe in Dublin town, I 
met a 
castle 
hack, 
The boots upon my feet he eyed, and the clothes 
upon my back; 
says, 
You're from America, you look so neat 
and trim. 
Just let me see your letters, sir — I 
handed one to 
him; 
PAT M.A.LLOY'S RETURN TO IRELAND.: 
PAT MALLOY'S RETURN TO IRELAND, 
.
9 
He says, It's from O'Mahony. 
And, says I,— You 
funny elf, 
It's a 
letter from my own sweet Moll, I'm taking 
home myself; 
lie says, You are a 
Fenian. Says I, — You're right, 
old boy, 
For Ould Ireland is my country, and my name is Pat 
Malloy. 
He had me then examined, and he says,— My nice 
young man, 
What brought you home to Ireland? Was it the 
Fenian plan? 
The ship, it brought me home, says I, and Fenians 
all agree, 
That from sweet Athlone to Blarney- Stone, Ould 
Ireland shall be free; 
But was it not for Molly's eyes that sticking in my. 
heart, 
An' me mother an' the childer, too, oh sure they had 
their part! 
I'll take them to America, and then look out, my boy,. 
For Ould Ireland is my country, and my name is 
Pat Malloy. 
But when I 
met my Molly clear, she kissed'me o'er 
and o'er, 
She could not laugh for crying, as I 
gave her goold 
galore ; 
It's your own, my dearest Molly, for I 
knew you 
would prove true, 
Every pound I 
sent me mother,I put by two for you: 
And now you have the shiners, Moll, and will you 
take myself? 
She blushed and whispered, — Yes, dear rat, I'm 
yours, but not for pelf; 
We got my mother's blessing, and it tilled my heart 
'with joy, 
For Ould Ireland is my country, and my name is 
Pat Malloy. 
10 
PAT M ALLOY.S RETURN To IRELAND. 
Early the next morning, sure, we went to Father 
Boyce: 
That rib, says he, wid a 
wink at me, it is a 
purty 
choice ; 
And mighty strong it is, says I, my heart, sure, 
knows it best, 
Three years or more, with thumps galore, she made 
it thrash my breast; 
These eyes are mighty killing, sir, but now they are 
my own, 
For four long years; when far from home, they made 
me cry och, hone! 
And now I 
ask your blessing, . sir, for to complete 
my 
joy, 
For Ould Ireland is my country, and my name is 
Pat Malloy. 
Now my mother's in her rocking-chair, her childer 
pay the rint, 
In New York, relieved from work, each happy hour 
is spent, 
And free from every toil and care; her heart is light 
' 
and free, 
She sings a 
good old Irish song, with young Pat on 
her knee; 
And Molly, lovely Molly, sure, he is her heart's de-
light, 
She sings, and talks, and plays with him both morn-
ing, noon, and night, 
And says he's his daddy's picture, and she calls him 
her darling boy, 
For he was born in Ould Ireland, and his name it is 
Malloy.

MURPHY DELANY. 
11 
MURPHY DELANY. 
It was Murphy Delany, so funny and frisky, 
Reeled in a 
shebeen shop to get his skin full; • 
And reeled out again, pretty well lined with whiskey, 
As fresh as a 
shamrock, and blind as a 
bull; 
When a 
trifling accident happened our rover, 
Who took the quay- side for the floor of his bed, 
And the keel of a 
coil-barge he just tumbled over, 
And thought all the time he was going to bed. 
And sing fillaloo, hubbaboo, whack botheration, 
Every man in his humor, as Kate kissed the pig. 
Some folks, passing by, drew him out of the river, 
And got a 
horse- doctor his sickness to mend; 
Who swore that poor Pat was no longer a 
liver, 
But dead as the devil, and there was an end. 
Then they sent for the coroner's jury to try him, 
But Pat, not much liking his. comical strife, 
Fell to twisting and twirling the while they sat by 
him, 
And came (when he found it convenient) to life. 
And sung, etc. 
Says Pat to the jury, — Your worship, an't Prase 
. \ 
ye, 
I.don't think I'm dead, so what is it you do? 
Not dead! 
says the foreman, you spalpeen be 
, 
aisy; 
Don't you think the doctor knows better than 
you? 
So then they went on with the business further, 
Examined the doctor about his belief; 
When they brought poor Delany in guilty of murder, 
And swore they would hang him in spite of his 
teeth. 
And sing, etc. 
12 
ST. PATRICK WAS A GENTLEMAN. 
Then Paddy laid hold of a 
clumsy shillalah, 
And laid on the doctor; who, stiff as a 
post, 
Still swore that it couldn't be Murphy Delany, 
But somethin ,, alive, and so .must be. a-ghost; 
Then the jury began, but with fear, to survey him, 
Whilst he like a 
devil about him did lay; 
And sent straight out of hand for the clargy to lay him, 
But Pat laid the clargy, and then ran away. 
And sung, etc. 
ST. PATRICK WAS A GENTLEMAN.' 
Saint Patrick was a 
gentleman; and came of dacent 
people, 
lie built a 
church in Dublin town, and upon it put a 
steeple; 
His mother was a 
Callahan, his father was a 
Brady; 
His sister was an (Monahan, and his brother an 
O'Grady. 
Chorus. 
Noh! noh! noh! noh! 
••  
Success attend St. Patrick's fist, for he's the 
decent saint, 0. 
He gave the bugs and toads a 
twist, 
He's a 
beauty without paint, 0! 
The Wicklow hills are very high, and so's the hill of 
lIowth, too ' 
• 
But I 
know a 
hill that's twice as high, and taller 
than them both, too; 
'Twas on the top of that high mount, where St. 
Patrick preached his sarinint. 
Ile made the frogs jump through She bogs, and he 
banished all the varmint. 
Chorus. 
Noh.! noh! etc. 
•PRIEST ,THE PARISH. 
13. 
No wonder the Irish boys should be' so gay and 
. frisky, 
For St. Patrick taught the happy knack of drinking 
of the whiskey. 
'Twas he that brewed the best o' malt, and under-
stood distilling, 
For his mother kept a 
shebeen shop in the town of 
' ' Inniskillen. 
Chorus. 
Noh! noh.! etc. 
Then should I 
be so fortunate as to go back to Mun-
ster, 
Och ! Fil be bound that from that grouiid, again I 
ne'er would once stir. 
'Twas there St. Patrick planted turf, and plenty of 
the praties, 
With pigs galore, a 
grab, reestore, and buttermilk 
and ladies. 
Chorus. 
Noh! noh! etc. 
PRIEST OF THE PARISH. 
An out-and-out good song. 
The priest of the parish on his garron bawn, 
Come Over the mountains to marry Susan; 
[Repeat the two first lines of every verse.] 
There was Patrick and Dermott, aud. a 
score more 
beside, 
With long spades and pitchforks to ride home the 
bride. 
Chorus. 
And you're welcome, all heartily welcome, 
Gramachree, welcome every one. 
14  
PRIEST OF _THE PARISH. 
As for the bride she was comely and fair, 
And as small in the waist as a 
two-year old mare. 
When she opened her jaws they spread like raven's 
wings, 
And with tearing bull-beef she burst both her eye-
strings. 
The bride she was dressed in .a 
short bodied gown, 
Her skirt was green drugget, the tail swept the 
ground; 
Her bodice was white, trimmed with blue all round, 
And her hat was a 
castor that cost her a 
pound. 
They had for their dinner a 
very fat goose, 
stuffed up with potatoes when she was let loose. 
They had slashings of beef that came from afar, 
And scullions were drawn on a 
slipping side- car.-
Of barley-meal bannocks they had twenty score, 
With stacks of call cannon and butter, galore, 
They'd a 
jar of good whiskey from a 
still of their 
own, 
And a 
sloop load of herrings came down from Tyrone. 
They'd a 
great pratie pudding, baked in a 
limn-kiln, 
Where ladies and gentlemen might eat their 1111; 
The tail of a 
rat, and the brains of a 
ram, 
Stuffed in a 
pig's bladder, and fried in a 
pan. 
The bride she sat at the top of the room, 
She walloped the grub with both knife, fork, and 
spoon, 
She called for a 
towel, 'twas handed in speed, 
When a 
piece of a 
bed- tick was handed indeed. 
The bride and the groom they danced, to he sure, 
For once their old brogues never parted the 'lure; 
They wiggled and waggled to the lilt of the bag, 
But their favorite tune it was " Moll in the Wad." 
THE WHISTLING THIEF. 
15 
She danced till the strings of her petticoats broke,. 
And with her bare buttocks she humored the joke; 
The piper lay over, as blind as a 
goat, 
While the cat eat his bags and the tails of his coat. 
When this noble couple retired to bed, 
With old shoes and stockings they bolstered their 
• heads; 
Arrah, will you lay over, and let us play fair, 
Take your hand out of that, for you'll get nothing 
there. 
Were you ever at the wedding of Kelly Poreen, , 
Such a 
wedding you never have seen; 
They danced, and they pranced, till their heads went 
• astray, 
And they danced banalang till the noon of next day. 
,THE WHISTLING THIEF. 
'When Pat came o'er the hills his colleen fair to see, 
His whistle loud and shrill his signal was to be. 
Oh, Mary, the mother cried, there's some one whis-
tling, sure •, 
Oh, mother, you know it's the wind that's whistling 
through the door. 
I've lived a 
long while; Mary, in this wide world, 
my dear, 
But the wind to whistle like that I 
never yet did 
hear. • 
But, mother, you know the fiddle hangs just behind 
the chink, 
And the wind upon the strings is playing a 
tune, I. 
think. 
1G 
THE WHISTLESG THIEF. 
Tho dog is barking now, and the fiddle can't play 
that tune; 
But, mother, you know that dogs will bark when 
they see the moon. 
Now how can he see the moon, when you know he's 
old and blind ; 
Blind dogs can't see the moon, or fiddles be played 
by wind. 
And now there is the pig, unaisy in his mind; 
But, mother, you know they say that pigs can see 
the wind. 
That's all very well in the day, but then I 
may re-
mark, 
That pigs no more than we can see anything in the 
dark. 
Now I'm not such a 
fool as you think, I 
know very 
well it is Pat; 
Be off, you whistling thief, and get along home out 
of that; 
And you be off to your bed, and don't bother me 
with your tears, 
For though I've lost my eyes, I 
have not lost my 
ears. 
Moral. 
Now, boys, too near the house, don't courting 
b 
d'ye mind, 
Unless you're certain sure the old woman's both deaf 
and blind; 
The days when they were young forget they never 
can; 
They're sure to tell the difference twixt a 
fiddle, a 
dog, or a 
man. 
NORAH CREINA. 
Who are you that comes this way, 
So like the Empress Diajanohna? 
Is it true what people say, 
That you're the famous Shelaginah? 
Or are you Pompey of great fame, 
Or may be the bold Tilaborana? 
Or are you Dido, or Dr. McGee ? 
Arrah, no, says she, I'm Norah Creina. 
Who are you that asks my name, 
Othello, Watts, Lased, or Julius Cwsar? 
Or are you Venus of bright fame, 
Or that old fogy, Nebuchadnezzar? 
Or may be you are Pluto stout, 
Or jolly old Bacchus, drunk and hearty? 
There, my girl, your eye is out, 
For I'm Napoleon Bonaparty. 
Won't you dine with me to-day? 
I'll send for you a 
hOrse and crupper; 
And in case you go before you stay, 
I'll tell you who we'll have to supper. 
We'll have McGillanty of the rocks, 
O'Dona,hue Slim, the Duke of Gloster, 
Oliver Cromwell and Bryan O'Linn, 
Cadullader Waddy and Dr. Foster. 
Chorus. 
I'm the girl that makes the stir, 
From Cork along to Skibbarena; 
All the night and day we drink strong tea, 
And whiskey, too, says Norah Creina,.

on, NORM!, MY DARLING. 
OH, NORAH, MY DARLING. 
Oh, Norah, my darling, dear Erin can boast, 
In its sea-girt Isle not a 
maiden more fair, 
And where love is the feast, and beauty the toast, 
There's none that for either with you can compare; 
All in vain the bright sun above me will shine,. 
11, blessed darling, it borrow no brightness from 
thee, 
If your eyes give no light, there is none, then, for 
mine, 
Och hone! my dear Norah, what darkness to me, 
Och hone I 
my dear Norah, what darkness to me. 
Oh, Erin go Bragh! though the stars maybe bright, 
When like diamonds they blaze, and sparkle at 
men, 
Yet, Norah, your eyes with their beautiftd light, 
Are brighter than they, and quite as near heaven. 
If the sun and the stars my heart cannot cheer, 
Bewitched by your beauty, oh, what will I 
do ? 
I'll not grope in the dark with daylight so near„ 
But turn, like a 
sunflower, dear Norah, to you. 
Now, Norah, take pity, and turn not away 
Your face, full of lilies and roses so sweet, 
Let love, .and not lightning, fair maiden, I 
pray 
From your eyes strike quickly the boy at your 
feet. 
Ah 
how my heart trembles, och hone, will you 
speak, 
The words which alone its contentions can still ? 
You need not, God bless you, your eye and your 
cheek, 
Those telltales betray you, I 
know that you will, 
Those telltales betray you, I 
know that you will. 
UNCLE PAT'S CABIN. 
tr-Ncir, PAT'S CABIN. 
Aig 
" 
Uncle Sam." 
Now all brave sons of Erin, 
To my side if you'll draw near, 
I'll sing as fine a 
ditty 
As any man would hear. 
'Twas by the side of a 
big mountain 
Where the spring comes bubbling by, 
Uncle Pat, he built a 
cabin, 
Which was one story high. 
He had a 
horse, a 
cow, and calf, 
had everything in rig, 
And beside him in the shanty 
lie kept his darling pig. 
Out of a 
pan he eat his pratees, 
Drank his coffee from a 
mug, 
But the thing which was the sweetest, ' 
Was the whiskey in the jug. 
By trade he was a 
tailor, 
And it took him to make a 
coat; 
lie could cut it out of broadcloth, 
Or the skin of a 
billy goat. 
His wife, she'd do the cooking, 
Very little, too, was that; 
A 
little drop of whiskey, 
Was all that suited Pat.

LANIGAN'S WAKE. 
LANIGAN'S WAKE. 
Written and first sung in America by NV-mlAm Cintivroisr, at 
Tony Pastor's Opera House, New 
York. 
" 
Lanigan's Bail." 
No doubt yez have heard of' poor Jerry Lanigan, 
He batthered away till he hadn't a 
pound; 
He gcv a 
grate ball to frinds and relations, 
But they since bawled at his wake, for he's now 
undher ground. 
His wake, my boys, was a ." caution to sparrows," 
Bad luck to the like uy id ivir was seen; 
Some kern in turf- creels and some in wheelbarrows, 
But I 
thripped it there on a 
ten-toed machine. 
Pal de lal, lal, etc. 
There was pipes and tobacco, and snuff, tay, and 
whiskey; 
The piper gev his owld chanthers a 
shake; 
There was Brian MeGurk, and his two grandmothers, 
And several others, at Lanigan's wake. 
There was tall Tim Toole, and blind Biddy Bergin, 
The sehoolmasther Brophy got'up to spake; ) 
Some dhrunken dhrumgullion flattened his hat, 
And " mum " was the word at Lanigan's wake. 
Pal de lal, etc. 
The company now got rather confuddled, 
Long Corny Casey get dhrunk as a 
fool; 
He went to McGurk, who lay dhrunk in a 
corner, 
And flattened his nose wid the three-legged Stool. 
Thin there was murdher — bad luck to sich fight-
- 
A 
reg'lar pitch-battle 'twas, no mistake; 
They'd have smashed all the glass, if' there had been 
windows, 
And they half killed the corpse at Lanigan's wake. 
LANIGAN'S BALL. 
21 
The uproar now lasted nearly an hour — 
The divil a 
ha'porth left whole in the place — 
Not even poor Jerry's remains wur rispected, 
In a 
Christian-like counthry 'twas quite a 
disgrace. 
Whin the uproar was loudest, sez a 
voice in the bed: 
Boys, 
Yez did the same thing whin ye kern to my ball; 
And if ye don't dhrop it, I'll lie here no longer, 
But scran to my sowl if I'll stand it at all. 
LANIGAN'S BALL. 
A roaring Irish song. 
Sung by T. L. DONNELLY, Comedian 
and Irish Vocalist, at the New Bowery Theatre. 
In the town of Altry lived one Jerry Lanigan, 
lie batthered away till he hadn't a 
pound, 
His father he died and made him a 
man again, 
lie left him a 
farm and ten acres of ground. 
lie gave a 
large party to all his relations 
That stood beside him whin " he went to the wall," 
Now if you but listen, I'll make your eyes glisten, 
With the rows and the ructions at Lanigan's ball. 
Dance. 
Whack, fal lal tal lal talladeddy! 
Whack, fal lal tal lal tal ladcddy! 
Whack, fal lal tal lal tal ladedcly! 
Whack, hurroo, for Lanigan's ball! 
'Twas myself had free invitations 
For all the boys and girls I 
might ask, 
In less than five minutes I'd frinds and relations, 
Singing as merry as flies round a 
cask. 
Jenny O'Hara, a 
nate little milliner, 
Tipt me the wink and asked me to call, 
Whin I 
arrived with Timothy Gilligan, 
Just in time for Lanigan's ball. 
Dance — Whack, fal, lal, etc. 
22 
1..A...m.aals-S 
BALL. 
Whin we got there they were dancing the polka, 
All round the room in a 
quare whirligig; 
But Jenny and I 
put a 
stop to this nonsense, 
We tip't thim a 
taste of a 
nate Irish jig. 
Oh, Mayrone, wasn't she proud o' int1 
We " batthered the ilure ". till the ceiling did fall 
For I 
spent three weeks at Brooks's Academy, 
Learning a 
step for Lanigan's ball. 
Dance 
Whack, fal, lal, etc. 
The boys were all merry, the girls all frisky, 
Drinking together in couples and groups, 
Whin an accident happened to Paddy O'Rafferty-, 
He stuck his right fut through Miss Flanigan's 
hoops. 
The craythur she fainted and roared " millia mur-
then ! " 
Called for her frinds, and gathered them all, 
Tim Dermocly swore that he'd go no further, 
But he'd have satisfaction at Lanigan's ball. 
Dance — Whack, fal, lal, etc. 
Och! arrah, boys, but then was the ructions, 
Myself got a 
wollop from Phelim McCocl, 
Soon I 
replied to his nate introduction, 
And we kicked up the devil's own phillalaloo. 
Casey, the piper, he was nearly strangled, 
They squeezed up his bags, chaunters and all; 
The girls in their ribbons, all got entangled, 
And that put a 
stop to Lanigan's ball. 
.Dance — Whack, fal, lal, etc.

THE IRISH - GIRL. , 
One evening, as I 
strayed clown the river-side, 
Looking alr around me, an Irish girl I 
spied, 
So red and rosy were her cheeks, and yellow was 
her hair, . 
And costly were the robes which my Irish girl did 
wear. 
Afir 
rrsxmAN's WAKE. 
25 
Her shoes of Spanish leather, were bound ronnd 
with spangles big, 
The tears came down her crystal eyes, and she-be-
gan to say, 
Och bone, and alas! store areen mocree„ 
Why should you go and leave me, and slight' your 
own Molly ? 
The first time that I 
saw my love, I 
was sick and 
very bad, 
All the re quest I 
asked was that she might tie my 
head! 
I 
asked her if one as bad as me could ever mend 
again, 
For love's a 
sore disorder — did yOu, ever feel the 
pain ? 
My love she'll not come nigh me for all the moan I 
make, . 
No neither will she pity me, if my poor heart should 
break, 
But was I 
of some noble blood, and she of low de-
gree, 
She would hear my lamentations, and come and 
pity me. 
FINNIGAN'S WAKE. 
As sung by- Billy Emerson. 
Tim Finnigan lived -in Walker Street, 
A 
gintleman Irishman, , 
mighty odd, 
lie had a 
brogue so neat and sweet, 
And to rise in the world he carried a 
hod. 
But he had a 
sort of a 
tippling way, 
With love for the liquor poor Tim was born, 
And to help him throwili his work each day, 
he'd a 
drop of the creature every morn. 
26 
FINNIGA.N'S WAKE. 
One morning Tim was rather full, 
Which caused his body for to shake, 
He fell from the ladder, split open his skull, 
And they carried him home his corpse to wake. 
They rolled him up in a 
nice clean sheet, 
And laid him out decently on the bed, 
With fourteen candles at his feet, 
And a 
gallon of whiskey at his head. 
His friends assembled at the wake, 
Misses Finnigan called out for a 
lunch; 
First they had both tea and cake, 
And then a 
small smather of whiskey punch. 
Biddy O'Brien began for to cry, 
" 
Such a 
poorty corpse did you ever see, 
Arrah, Tim avourneen, and why did you die?" 
" 
Ah, thin, hould yer gab," says Judy Magee. 
Then Peggy O'Connor took up the job, 
" 
Arrah, Biddy," says she, " you're wrong, I'm 
sure," 
But Judy she hit her a 
smack in .the gob, 
And left her sprawling on the floor. 
Each side in the war did soon engage, 
'Twas woman to woman and man to man, 
Shillalah law was all the rage, 
And a 
terrible ruction soon began. 
Micky Mulvaney raised his head, 
When a 
gallon of whiskey was thrown at him, 
He dodged, and it hopping upon the bed, 
The liquor scattered over Tim; 
Bedad he revives, see how he raises, 
And Timothy, standing straight up in bed, 
Says, " Now you're battering away for your lives, 
Bad luck to you all, do you think I'm dead?"

THE BOYS THAT LIVE IN IRELAND. 
My name is Ned O'Manny, 
I 
was born in sweet Killarny, 
I 
can fight, dance, or sing, 
I 
can plow, reap, or mow. 
And if I 
meet a 
pretty girl 
I 
never practice blarney. 
I 
have more alluring, 
Which, perhaps, you'd like to know. 
I'm none of your Bullgrederes, 
Nor other shabby families, 
But can write my pedigree, 
A pretty title show. 
Oh, I'm of the O's and Mac's, 
And likewise the sturdy Whacks; 
That live and toil in Ireland, 
Where the apple-praties grow; 
That live and toil in Ireland, 
Where the apple-praties grow. 
I 
could a 
deal relate, 
If I 
could but trace my pedigree. 
My mother was a 
Hogan, 
But my father I 
don't know, 
I've ninety-nine relations 
In a 
place they call Rosearberry, 
f 
And each unto their names has a 
Mac or an 0. 
My uncle A'as a 
Brallaghan, 
My aunt she was a 
Collaghan, 
And, as to my character, 
Why, I 
can plainly show 
I'm a 
rantin', roving blade, 
And I 
never was afraid, 
For I 
was born in Ireland, 
Where the apple-praties grow; 
For I 
was born in Ireland, 
Where the apple-praties grow. 
28 
THE BOYS TEAT LIVE IN MELAND. 
May Heaven still protect 
Our hospitable country, 
Where I 
first drew my living breath, 
And heard its cocks to crow. 
Adieu to its green hills, 
And its lovely Bay of Banty, 
Where many a 
pleasant evening 
My love and I 
did go. 
Where shoals of fish so pleasantly 
Did sport about so merrily 
Beneath its glassy surface, 
Their wanton tricks to show. 
Oh, those scenes I 
did enjoy, 
Like a 
gay, unthinking boy, 
With the lads who live in Ireland, 
Where the apple-praties grow; 
With the lads who live in Ireland, 
Where the apple-praties grew. 
St. Patrick was our saint, 
And a 
blessed man in truth was he; 
Great gifts unto our country 
lie freely did bestow. 
He banished all the frogs and toads 
That sheltered in our country, 
And unto other regions 
It's they were forced to go. 
There is one fact, undoubtedly, 
That cannot contradicted be, 
For, trace the Irish history, 
And it will plainly show, 
Search the universe all round, 
Tighter fellows can't be found 
Than the lads who live in Ireland, 
Where the apple-praties grow; 
Than the lads who live in Ireland, 
Where the apple-praties grow.

KATY AVOURNEEN. 
'Twas a 
cold winter's night, and the tempest was 
snarling, . 
The snow like a 
sheet Covered cabin and sty, 
When Barney flew over the hills to his darling, 
And raprd at the window where Katy did lie. 
" 
Arrali, jewel," says he, " are you sleeping or wak-
in' ? 
It's a 
cold bitter night, and my coat it is thin, — 
The storm in a 
brewite, tbe frost is a 
bakin', 
Oh, Katy avourneen, you must let me in." 
".Ah, then, Barney," says Kate, and she spoke 
through the window, 
" 
How could you be takin' us out of ()imbed? 
To come at this time it's a shame . and a 
sin, ,too, — 
It's whiskey, not love, has got into your head. 
If your heart it was true, of my fame you'd be ten-
der; 
Consider the time, and there's' nobody in; 
What has a 
poor girl but her name to defend' her? 
No, Barney avourneen; I 
won't let you in." 
, 
" 
A-cush-la," says he, " it's my eye is a 
fountain, 
That weeps for the wrong I 
might lay at your 
door; 
Your name is more white than the snow, on the 
mountain, 
And Barney would die to preserve It as pure. 
I'll go to my home though the winter winds face 
me — 
I'll whistle them 
Air I'm happy within, 
And the words of my Katy shall comfort and bless 
me, — 
"No, Barney avourneen, I 
won't let you in."

PADDY MAGEE'S DREAM. 
ERIN MAVOURNEEN. 
31 
PADDY MAGEE'S DREAM. 
John Bull he was an Englishman, 
, 
And went on tramps one day, 
With threepence in his pocket 
To take him a 
long way. 
He tramped along for miles and miles, 
Yet no one did he see, 
Till he fell in with an Irishman 
Whose name was Paddy Magee. • 
Then they overtook, i 
Scotchman, 
Who, like them, was out of work; 
To judge by his looks, he was hard up, 
And as hungry as a 
Turk. 
" 
Can you lend me a 
shilling, Scotty?" 
At last said Paddy Magee. 
" 
I'm sorry I 
canna'," said the Scotchman, 
"For I 
ha:e na got ane bawbee." 
" 
Now I 
think we had better buy a 
loaf," 
The Englishman did say, 
" 
And then in yonder hay stack 
Our hunger sleep away. 
We can get a 
drink of water 
From yonder purling stream, 
And the loaf shall be his in the morning 
4 
Who has the greatest dream." . 
The Englishman dreamt, by the morning, 
Ten million men had been 
For ten years digging a 
turnip up, 
The largest ever seen. 
At last they got the turnip up, 
By working night and day, 
Then it took five million horses 
This turnip to pull away. 
Said the Scotehman, —" I've been dreaming 
Fifty million men had been 
For fifty years making a 
boiler, 
The largest ever seen," 
" 
What was it for?" said the Englishman, 
" 
Was it made of copper or tin?" 
" 
It was made of copper," said Scotty, 
" 
To boil your turnip in." 
" 
Och," said Paddy, " I've been dreaming 
An awful great big dream: 
I 
dreamt I 
was in a 
haystack, 
By the side of a 
purling stream; 
I 
dreamt that you and Scotty was there, 
As true as I'm an Oof; 
By the powers, I 
dreamt I 
was hungry, 
So I 
got up and eat the loaf." 
ERIN MAVOURNEEN. 
When the pure sense of honor shall cease to inspire 
thee, 
And kind hospitality leaves thy gay shore; 
When the nations that know thee no longer admire 
thee, 
Then, Erin mavourneen, ni love thee no more. 
When the trumpet of fame shall cease to proclaim 
thee, 
Of warriors the nurse, in the ages of yore, 
When the muse and the record of genius disclaim 
thee, 
Then, Erin mavourneen, I'll love thee no more. 
When thy brave sons no longer are generous -and 
witty, 
And cease to be loved by the fair they adore, , 
When thy daughters i 
no longer are virtuous and 
pretty, 
Then, Erin mayourneen, I'll love thee no more. 
THE TWIG OF THE SHANNON. 
On the beautiful banks of the Shannon 
There grows such an illegant tree, 
And the fruit that it bears is shillalah 
I've a 
sprig of it here you may see. 
'Tis the remnant of all my large fortune, 
It's the friend that ne'er played me a 
trick, 
And I'd rather lose half my supportin' . 
Than I'd part with this illegant stick. 
'Twas a 
delicate sprig in the summer, 
When I 
first cut it off from the tree, 
And I've kept it through all the cold weather. 
Faix, the sprig of shillalah for me. 
It's the porter that's carried my luggage, 
For I've shouldered it many a 
mile, 
And from the thieves it will safely protect me 
In a 
beautiful, illegant style. 
It's useful for rows in the summer, 
• 
And when winter comes on with a 
storm, 
If you're short of a 
fire in the cabin, 
You can burn it to keep yourself warm. 
'Twas a 
beautiful twig, etc. 
It's a 
friend both so true and so constant„ 
Its constadey pen cannot paint, 
For it always is there when it's wanted, 
And sometimes is there when it ain't. 
It beats all your guns and your rifles, - 
For it go es off''whene'er you desire, 
• 
And it's sure to hit just what it aims at, 
For shillalahs they never miss , 
fire. 
'Twas a 
beautiful twig, etc. 
DERMOT ASTORE. 
It's a 
talisman so upright and honest, 
Twenty shillings it pays in the pound, 
So if ever it gets in your debt, sir, 
You're sure to be paid. I'll be bound. 
It never runs up a 
long score, sir, 
In trade it's not given to fail, 
There's no danger of its being insolvent, 
For it always pays down on the nail. 
'Twas a 
beautiful twig, etc. 
And, faith, at an Irish election, 
An argument striking it's there, 
For, with brickbats and sprigs of the Shannon, 
We see things all go right and square. 
It's then there's no bribery at all, sir, 
They vote as they like every soul, 
But it's no use opposing shillalah, 
Or it's sure to come down on the poll. 
'Twas a 
beautiful twig, etc. 
DERMOT ASTORE. 
, Written by 3lits. CPAWFORD. 
Oh, Dermot astore! between waking and sleeping, 
I 
heard thy dear voice, and I 
wept to its lay; 
Every pulse of my heart the sweet measure was 
keeping, 
Till Killarney's wild echoes had borne it away. 
Oh, tell me, my own love, is this our last meeting? 
Shall we wander no more in Killarney's green 
bowers, 
To watch the bright sun o'er the dim hills retreat 
And tl.ie wild stag at rest in his bed of spring 
flowers? 
Oh, Dermot astore! etc. 
34 
PAT AND TIE DUTCHMAN. 
Oh, Dermot astore! how this fond heart would 
flutter, 
When I 
met thee by night in the shady boreen, 
And heard thine own voice in a 
soft whisper utter 
Those words of endearment, " Mavourneen col-
een ! " 
I 
know we must part, but oh, say not forever, 
That it may -be for years adds enough to my pain; 
But I'll cling to the hope, that though now we must 
sever, 
In some blessed hour I 
shall meet thee again. 
Oh, Dermot astore! etc. 
PAT AND THE DUTCHMAN. 
Ant—. Down, Derry, Down." 
It's not long ago, of a 
cowld frosty night, 
A 
poor Irish fisherman got a 
sad fright; 
his cabin it stood by the side of the sea, 
And he sat drinking whiskey, and thought it was tea. 
Derry down, etc. 
His candle was one that had never a 
wick, 
'Twas the moon — but it shone not, the night was 
so thick; 
When a 
voice from the ocean roared out a 
deep sigh, 
At the sight of which groan Paddy cocked his left 
eye, 
`I 
Derry down, etc. 
The groan was repeated, Pat ran to the shore, 
For au Irishman ne'er on distress closed his door; 
" 
Speak out now," says Pat, "' if there's somebody 
dead," 
When up from the ocean there popped a 
black head. 
Derry down, etc. 
PAT AND THE DUTCHMAN. 
35 
Now the head wasn't black, it was only the hair, 
But when seen in the dark, how it made Paddy stare; 
And it made him stare more when, with voice loud 
and clear, 
It opened its mouth and sung out, " Aw, myn-
heer! " 
Derry down, etc. 
• 
By the help of his senses Pat very soon found 
That the man had been shipwrecked, but hadn't been 
drowned; 
So into his cabin he led him at once, 
Saying, " Sit by the fire, now, and dry your wet 
sconce." 
Derry down, etc. 
Now this sailor a 
Dutchman he happened to be, 
Who of English or Irish knew not C 
from D ; 
And Paddy knew nothing out of his own tongue, 
But what good St. Patrick, his saint, said and sung. 
Derry down, etc. 
The Dutchman still kept his warm seat by the fire, 
And opposite to him sat Pat's chief desire— 
His wife — a 
sweet damsel of six feet and two, 
With a 
voice like a 
trumpet, and throat like a 
cow. 
Derry down, etc. 
They talked on by signs, and they talked on by 
winks, 
And sometimes by shrugs and grimaces and blinks, 
Till the Dutchman was dry and most plenteously 
fed, 
When Paddy hawked off his tired body to bed. 
Derry down, etc. 
36 
PADDY'S WEDDING. 
Faith, he soon heard a 
sound which he took for a 
kiss, 
" 
Arrah, blazes !" says he, " sure there's something 
amiss 
So out of his bed in a 
moment jumped Pat, 
Saying, —" What is yourself and the Dutchman 
both at? " 
Derry 'down, etc. 
" 
How dare you, you jade, for to let him make free, 
In taking those kisses belonging to me ? 
Why didn't you threaten him at the first.tOuch?" 
"Oh, how could 1," says she, " when I 
couldn't 
speak, Dutch?" 
Derry down, etc. 
PADDY'S WEDDING. 
Sure won't you hear what roaring cheer, 
Was spread at Paddy's wedding, 0, 
And how so gay they spent the day, 
From the churching to the bedding, 0. 
First, book in hand, came Father Quipes, 
With the bride's dadda, the bailie, 0, 
While all the way to church the pipes 
Struck up a

Then there was Mat and sturdy Pat, 
And merry Morgan Murphy, 0,

At twelve in the morning, all misery scorning, 
I, Phe 
O'Durphy; one evening was born; 
So, to make themselves frisky, and tipple the whis-
key, 
The neighbors assembled as soon as ' twas morn. 
" 
Och, fait ! " cried _ my mother, " he's Cupid's own 
brother, 
He's a 
much finer boy than his sister, Miss Kate;„" 
So, to give me dissarning, and plenty'of 
They sent me to school unto Paddy O'Prate. 
Tudy row di dow. 
Edication being finished, my patience diminished, 
With a 
heart light as lead-to my home then I 
goes; 
"What an illigaut crature, grace moves in each 
fature," 
The jewels all cry when my person I 
shows. 
But I 
soon was forsaken, my parents was taken 
By ould Father Death, while wid whiskey alive! 
And left me in money -full twenty pounds, honey, 
A 
nate mud estate, and of pigslour or five: 
'ruddy row di dow. 
After sighing and mourning, my person adorning, 
I 
sold my estate, and to London I 
trudged; 
And widout,any blunder, the folks stared wid IyOn-
der, 
As, wid breeches 'cross shoulder, to London I 
trudged. . 
I 
soon reached:that city, the ladles so pretty, 
All smiled in my face, and the men cried, " Od rot 
Och! there's a 
nate dandy, his legs arc so bandy, 
And then what a 
nose to take snuff he has got." 
Tudy row di dow. 
39 
In London so gayly I 
sported it daily, 
I 
saw all the sights in the town to be seen; 
Till one night, at a 
ball, sir, a 
lady so tall, sir, 
In Cupid's clear ditch quickly tumbled me in. 
The hair on her,head, sir, as carrots was red, sir; 
Her voice, too, was softer than father's old sow's. 
Her illigant nose, too, was red as a 
rose, too; —. " 
While I 
gazed I 
felt some how, I 
cannot tell how.

To joke I.soon brought her, to home did escort her, 
But soon I 
found out that my lady was bad; 
She had taken my purse, sir, faith, and what was 
worse, sir, 
She had taken likewise every dump that I 
had. - 
I 
quick did upbraid her, my fist nately laid her , 
Slap into a 
gutter, but,-arrah, alas! 
In a 
giffy she rose, then, hit me on the nose, then, 
Which knocked me through a shop- front, and 
•smashed all the glass.

But what most displazed me, some officers sazed mc, 
And like a

Ten pounds they demanded, and. I 
was remanded, 
By me conscience! because I'd no money to pay. 
But what did discontent me, to Brixton they sent

When my time .was expired, from town I

BAGGED PAT. 
RAGGED PAT. 
Now, all young gents, to my song lend your car, 
•'Tis about a 
poor Irishman, whose name was Pat 
Clere; 
'His'clothes were all patches, and torn was his hat; 
They called him the name of " Poor Ragged Pat." 
Chorus. 
Oh, boy, Paddy Whack! 
• 
A 
cat NV011't catch mice, if put in a 
sack. 
On Sunday, at church, his coat was of black, 
With a 
big ivory button sewed into its back; 
And his breeches were blue, the cloth very coarse--
He'd look like a 
clown if he sat on a 
horse. 
Chorus. 
Oh, Paddy whack, etc. 
Now, this gent, ragged Pat, although he was poor, 
'Sickness, no matter what sort, he could cure; 
With a 
measure of oats, another of grass, 
He would take away glanders from any jackass. 
Chorus. 
Oh, Paddy whack, etc. 
His eyes they were black, his volce was so sweet, 
He stood up for the laws, and on Priddy ate Meat; 
On Sabbath, at church, he'd sure shut his eyes, 
With his big mouth wide open, as if cabching flies. 
Chorus. 
Oh, Paddy whack, otc. 
LLNIEBICK IS BEAUTIFUL. 
41 
As you gave close attention, I'll here end my song, 
Although full of pathos, it's not very long: 
In the churchyard of Erin, under the sod, 
Lies poor ragged Pat, alongside of his hod. 
Chorus. 
Oh, Paddy whack, etc. 
LIMERICK IS BEAUTIFUL. 
Limerick -is beautiful, 
As everybody knows, 
The river Shannon, full of fish, 
Through that city flows. 
But 'tis not the river or the fish, 
That weighs upon my mind, 
Nor with the town of Limerick 
I've any fault to find. 
Ochone, ochone. 
The girl I 
love is beautiful, 
And soft eyed as the fawn, 
She lives in Garryowen, 
And is called the Colleen Dawn. 
And proudly as that river flows 
Through that famed 'city, • 
As proudly and without a 
word,' 
That colleen goes by me. 
Ochone, ochone. 
If I 
was made the. Emperor 
Of Russia to command, 
Or Julius Cwsar, or the 
Lord lieutenant of the land, 
I'd give my plate and golden store, 
I'd give up my army, 
The horse, the rifles, and the foot, 
And the Royal artillery. 
Ochone, ochone. 
I'd give the crown from off my head, 
My people on their knees, 
rd give the fleet of sailing ships 
Upon the briny seas; 
A 
beggar I 
would go to bed, 
And 
rise at dawn, 
If by my side for my sweet bride 
I 
had found my Colleen 13awn. 
Ochone, ochone.

LARRY O'BRIEN. 
In Dublin town I 
was born in, 
In Limerick town I 
was bred in; 
A 
neat little fellow for a 'courting, 
When my name was Larry O'Brien; 
When the press gang they took me, 
And sent me to sea, 
And there strange sights 
Young Larry was to see. 
Spoken. 
". With their raking, yes, and with their scraping." 
Chorus. 
Sure, a 
sailor they were making of young Larry;. 
Och and thunder was the game that I 
did tarry, 
Which did never do for Larry O'Brien. 
Then the captain gave orders for sailing, 
Contrary winds were prevailing, 
American ships we were hailing, 
Played the devil Nvid young Larry O'Brien; 
When a 
fair wind we got, 
Och, we whipped her into dock, 
And then we did strip her of strap, mast, and block. 
Spoken. 
"With their oakum, yes, and with their thrriliSh 
oakum." 
Chorus. • 
Sure, a 
sailor, etc. 
Then the lcaptain came up as soft as milk sop, 
And ordered me right up into the top, 
Which caused my head to whirl around like a 
whip-
ping top. 
Which never did do for Larry O'Brien; 
SHELAII O'NEAL.

Then the sailors went up, 
And they lowered down a 
rope, 
And they fastened it around my body 
And they hauled me up. 
Spoken. 
They were hauling, yes, and,I was bawling, 
Still, the divils they kept hauling on young I. 
Chorus. 
Sure, a 
sailor, etc. 
STIELAII 
When first I 
began for to sigh and to woo her, 
Of many fine things,I did say a 
great deal; 
But, above all the rest, that which pleased her the 
best 
Was — Och, will you marry me, Shelah O'Neal? 
My point I 
soon carried, 
For straight we were married, 
Then the weight of my burden I 
soon 'gait to feel; 
For she scolded, she fisted, 
Oh, then I 
enlisted, 
Left Ireland and whiskey, and Shelah O'Neal. 
Then, tired and dull-hearted, oh, then I 
deserted, 
I 
fled into regions fdr distant from home — 
To Frederick's army, where none e'er could harm me, 
Save Shelah herself in the shape of a 
bomb. 
I 
fought every battle 
Where cannons did rattle, 
relt sharp shot, alas! and the sharp-pointed steel; 
But, in all my wars round, 
Thank my stars! I 
ne'er found 
Aught so sharp as the tongue of cursed Shelah 
O'Neal.

Och

In the boughs of a

"NO imizNILED APPLY." 
4E7 
IRISH NEED APPLY." 
rY JOHN F. rooLa. 
Written for and sung with immense success by To:TY PAsTon. 
I'm a 
dacint boy, just lauded from the town of Bal-
lyfad ; 
I 
want a 
situation — yis, and want It mighty, bad. 
I 
saw a 
place advartised— " It's the thing for me," 
says I; 
But the dirty spalpeen ended with — " No Irish need 
apply." 
"Whoo 
I " says I; " but that's an insult — though 
to get the place I'll try; " 
7 Bo I 
wint to see the blaggard with" No Irish need 
apply." 
I 
started off to find the house, I 
got it mighty soon; 
There I 
found the ouhl chap salted — he was read-
ing the Tribune. 
I 
tould him what I 
came forowhin he in a 
rao-e did fly; 
" 
No ! " says he, " you are a Paddy; and 
Irish 
need apply." 
Thin I 
felt my dandher rising, and I'd like to black 
his eye — 
To tell an Irish gintlenaan, " No Irish need apply." 
I 
couldn't stand it longer, so a 
hoult of him I 
took. 
And I 
gave him such a 
welting as he'd get at Donny-
brook. 
Ile hollered, ".Millia murther!" and to ,get away 
did try, 
And swore he'd never write again, " No Irish need 
apply." 
Tie made a 
big apology, I 
bid him then good-by — 
saying, " When next you want a 
bating, add, No 
Irish need apply.'" 
48 " 
NO nusx NEED APPLY." 
Sure I've heard that in America it always is the 
plan 
That an Irishman is just as good as any other man: 
A home and hospitality they never will deny 
The stranger here, or ever say, " No Irish need ap-
ply." 
But some black sheep are in the flock — a 
dirty lot, 
say I; 
A. dada man will never write, " No Ifish need 
apply." 
Sure Paddy's heart is in his hand; as all the world 
does know; 
His praties and his whiskey he will share, with 
friend or foe; 
His door is always open to the stranger passing by; 
He never thinks of saying, " None but Irish may 
apply." 
And in Columbia's history his name is ranking 
high; 
Thin the divil take the knaves that write, " No 
Irish need apply !". 
Ould Ireland on the battle- field a 
lasting fame has 
made •, 
We 
all have heard of l`bleagher's men, and Coreoran's 
brigade. 
Though fools may flout and bigots rave, and fanatics 
may cry, 
Yet when they want good fighting-men, the Irish 
may apply. 
And when for freedom and the right they raise 
the battle- cry, 
Then the rebel ranks begin to think no Irish need 
apply. 
BOYS CAN no. 
49 
I 
ps. 
WHAT IRISH BOYS CA'S DO. 
Answer to " No Irish need Apply." 
They insult an Irishman, and :think naught .of what 
theY say; 
They'll call him green, an Irish bull; it happens 
every day. 
Now to these folks I'll say a 
word ; to sing a 
song 
I'll try, 
And answer to those dirty words " No Irish need 
apply ! " 
t• 
So, if you'll give attention, I'll sing my song to you, 
And the subject of this song shall be: What Irish 
boys can do. 
J 
If you'd come to Ireland, they'd treat you well, I'M. 
Sure; 
Pat would share his last potato with the destitute 
and poor; 
If you were sick and weary, and had no place to 
rest, 
The bed you'd get, though poor perhaps, would be 
Pat's very best. 
He'd nurse you, too: he would that, and give you 
whisky, too; 
And you cannot find a 
nobler act than Irishmen can 
do. 
Did you ever know an Irishman from any danger 
flinch ? 
In fighting, too, he'd rather die than give his foe an 
inch. 
Among the bravest in the world are the sons of 
Erin's green isle. 
54) 
WHAYIBISH. BOYS CAN DO. 
Sure the Iron Duke of Wellington was a 
native of 
the soil; 
And didn't he badly whip the French on the plains 
of Waterloo ? 
Which plainly showed to the whole world what. 
Irishmen can do. 
Old Ireland's had her warriors, who fought both 
true and brave; 
Pat's assisted every nation, on the land and on the 
wave. 
And poets, too, she' had; yes, many and many a 
score; 
Where can yori find much brighter stars than toyer 
or Tom Moore ? 
Old Ireland's had her actors, and authors not a 
few; 
And things of wit and humor the Irish all can do. 
Did you ne'er hear tell of Sheridan, or of lamented 
Catharine Hays ? • 
Did you ne'er see fun in Irish songs, or laugh at 
Irish plays ? 
Old Ireland's had her statesmen; their fame the 
wide world rings; 
She's likewise had musicians to tune her old harp 
strings! 
Not all Irish girls are beautiful, but then they're 
always true, 
And, for faith and generosity, the Irish girls will do. 
And then, too, in the present war betWeen the North 
and South, 
Let no dirty slur on Irish ever escape your mouth; 
Sure, did you ne'er hear tell of the 69th, who bravely 
fOught at Bull Run ? 
OH, TAKE ME TO THY HEART AGAIN. 
51 
And Meagher, of the seven days'fight, that was in 
front of Richmond ? 
With General Shields, who fought so brave for the 
Flag Red, White, and Blue? 
And anything like a 
bayonet charge the Irish boys 
can. do. 
Then, why slur upon the Irish? Why are they 
treated So ? 
What is it you have against them? is what I 
want 
to know. 
Sure, they work for all they get, and that you can't 
dewy! 
Then why insult them with the words: No Irish 
need apply ? 
If you want to find their principles, go search the 
wide world through, 
And you'll find all things that's noble the Irish folks 
can do. 
OH, TAKE ME TO THY HEART AGAIN. 
As Bung by Miss .A.da Tesman. 
Oh, take me to thy heart again, 
I 
never more will grieve thee, 
All joys are fled and hope is dead, 
If I 
indeed must leave thee; 
Forgive the wild and angry words' 
This wayward heart hath spoken; 
I 
did not dream those cherished cords 
So lightly could be broken. 
Chorus. 
Oh, take me to thy heart again, 
I 
never more will grieve thee, 
All joys are fled and hope is dead, 
If I 
indeed must leave thee. 
52 
THE NS-A=7'01Sb BOYS. 
I 
think, how*very sad and lone 
This life would be without thee, 
For all the joys my heart hath known 
Are closely twined about thee; 
Oh, teach me to subdue the pride 
That wounded thee so blindly, 
And be once more the gentle guide 
Who smiled on me so kindly. 
Chorus. 
Oh, take me to thy heart, etc. 
TUE WATERFORD BOYS. 
ATE — " The Flaming O'Flannigans.“ 
Well, boys, for divarsion we've all met together, 
I'll tell you how from Waterford hither I 
came; 
I 
left that dear city in dark, gloomy weather, 
My heart it was light and my pockets the same. 
I 
lilted a 
song as I 
tripped it along; 
By the roadside a 
tavern I 
happened to spy, 
And as I 
was meltin', my pockets I 
felt in, 
For the price of a 
drink — I 
was mortally dry. 
Chorus. 
But we are the boys for fun, wit, and element, 
Drinking, and dancing, and all other joys, 
Ructions, destruction, divarsion, and devilment, 
Who can compare with the Waterford Boys ? 
In the tavern T 
strolled, out the landlord he rolled, 
" 
Good-mornin'," says he — says I, " If you please, 
Could you shake me a 
bed, but first bring some 
bread, 
With a 
bottle of porter and small lump of cheese.

Tint WATBRVORD BOYS. 
53 
For times they are queer, and provisions are dear, 
If you cannot get meat, with cheese be content ; " 
Says the landlord, " You're right," as he brought me 
the bite, 
So I 
rolled up my sleeves and at it I 
went. 
But we are the boys, etc. 
My bread and cheese ended, I 
then condescended 
To seek my repose, so I 
bade 'em good- night, 
Soon under the clothes I 
was trying to doze, 
But first popped in my toes and then popped out 
the light. 
Not long was I 
sleeping, I 
heard something creep-
ing, 
And meandering and scratching about the bed-
post, 
My breath I 
suspended, but the noise never ended, 
Thinks I, ye have mighty long claws for a 
ghost. 
But we are the boys, etc. 
The row it commences, near out of my senses 
I 
ventured to peep from beneath the bed- clothes •, 
"Milla murther, what's that?" 'Twas a 
big black 
jack- rat, 
With a 
leap from the floor came a 
top o' my nose. 
"Divil swape ye," says I, " for a 
scheming ould. vag-
abone; 
Take that, and that "— I 
jumped on the floor. 
" 
04, Moses! blue fire! Biddy! Sophia! 
The rats they are eating me up by the score." 
But we are the boys, etc. 
The landlord affrighted, he then brought a 
light 
in, 
Says I, " I'm near dead, it's time I'm away ; " 
Says he, " Before going, I'd have ye be knowing 
For supper and bed you've five shillings to pay.' 
54 
KATY O'CONNOR. 
" 
Five shillings! for, what? 
Now, don't be dis-
gracing 
Yourself as a 
rogue," says I, " if you please; 
'When I 
can't sleep for rats, you've the devil's own 
face on ye; 
To charge me five shillings for plain bread and 
cheese." 
But we are the boys, etc. ' 
Says he, " Och! those rats, I 
wish they would leave 
me; 
They ruin my trade— I'm not worth a 
rap." 
Says I, " The five shillings now would ye forgive me, 
If I 
tell you the way to keep out every tat." 
" 
I 
will." 
Says I, —" Then to supper invite them, 
And plain bread and cheese set before them, be 
sure, 
Don't mind if they're willing, but charge them five 
Bad luck to the rat that ye'll ever see more." 
But we are the boys, etc. 
KATY O'CONNOR. 
When first I 
was married to Katy O'Connor, 
So fair was her face, and so neat was her trim, 
That sweet Mr. Barney he doted upon her, 
But devil a 
bit did she dote upon him. 
She frowned and she snubbed at her dutiful lover, 
And said very often what shouldn't be said; 
And when my dear darling began to discover 
She could not break my heart, faith, she tried at 
my head. 
With a 
whack, whillilew, hubbaboo, botheration, 
Can't you be aisy, be aisy, my dear; 
With a 
whack,whillilew, hubbaboo, botheration, 
Can't you, oh, can't you be aisy, my dear. 
PADDY O'FLANAGAN. 
So, says I 
to myself, Mr. Bariey O'Bother, 
Did you never see two frisky puppies at play? 
When the pert-cur that's perching the other, 
The moment he stops, in his turn runs away. 
To be sure, then, I 
altered my tone in a 
jiffy, 
And filled the dear creature so full of alarm, 
That just as I 
thought, she popped into the Liffey, 
The sweet little Katy plump'd into my arms. 
With a 
whack, etc. 
And there's a 
receipt to live snug and quiet, 
And get all your grievances laid on the shelf, 
When you stop your beloved one from breediag a 
riot, 
And don't like to wait till she stops of herself. 
With a 
whack, etc. 
PADDY O'FLANAGAN. 
'Twas Paddy O'Flanagan set out, one morning, 
From Dublin sweet city to London, on foot, 
In an old tattered jacket all foppery scorning, 
With a 
shoe on his leg, and his neck in a 
boot. 
Musha whack! in no time, he walked over the water, 
And soon set his head on England's famed shore, 
While, for joy of his safety, his stomach did totter, 
lie sung Teddy O'Reilly and Molly Asthore. 
With his phillilu, hubbuboo, hugamaurainee, 
Musha gra, botheration, and smalliloo, huh! 
A 
place he soon got when in London arrived, sir, 
To brush up a'gemman, and wait on his coat; 
Where he soon learned to know that jist four beans 
make five, sir, 
And could tell you a 
tale with his tongue clown his

PADDY O'FLANAGAN. 
Now, one day, while Pat was his master attending, 
In his study, where letters around him did lay, 
When he begged hard for one to his friends to be 
sending, 
As 'twould save him from writing, and be the best 
Way. 
With his phillilu, etc. 
Soon after, being sent with a 
basket and letter, 
Crammed full of live pigeons to give to a 
friend, 
Enraged at their fluttering, he thought it was better 
To set them at large, and their misery end; 
Then on jog he went to the place where directed, 
But the door had no knocker; so, what does he 
do ? 
Faith! he knocked at the next, when the servant 
attending: 
Cried Pat, — Its your knocker I 
want, and not you! 
With your phillilu, etc. 
Being brought 'fore the gemman, he gave him the 
note, 
Who said, — In the letter here's pigeons, I 
find. 
Be jabers! says Pat, that's a 
very good joke! 
For, they fled from the basket, and left me behind! 
The gentleman swore: for the loss he must pay, 
Or on losing his place for certain depend. 
Pat replied —To your offer I'll not once say nay, 
If you'll he so kind as the money to lend! 
With my 
phillilu, etc. 
Being pleased with the joke, poor Pat got forgiven; 
For, though blunder on blunder, no harm there 
was meant, 
And, if he's not dead, with his master he's living, 
And, when not out of humor, is always content.

NORATI MAGEE. 
Sung by W ILLIAM CARLETON. . 
Dark eyes softly beaming, and pearly teeth gleaming, 
And black, rippling tresses, loose, flowing, and 
free; 
A 
face sweet and simple, and many an arch dimple — 
That's Norah, my Norah, sweet Norah Magee. 
A 
small foot, a 
neat foot, a 
dainty and fleet- foot, 
No foot in the dance halt' so nimble ' you'd see; 
As gay as a 
fairy, and graceful and airy — 
That's .Norah, my Norah, sweet .Norah Magee. 
Now teazing, now vexing, and always perplexing, 
The heart that 'adores her to such a 
degree; 
Now frowning, now smiling, bewitching, beguil-
ing — 
That's Norah, my Norah, sweet Norah Magee. 
She has lovers a 
dozen, and Maurice, her cousin — 
A 
torment and plague is that cousin to me — 
For it passes endurance, his airs and assurance, 
To Norah, my Norah, sweet Nora Magee. 
But Norah, I

I've a 
stick of good blackthorn, t'would soon let

That to no base pretender I'll ever surrender 
My beautiful Norah, sweet Norah Magee. 
Dark eyes softly beaming, and pearly teeth gleaming, 
Capricious, and wilful, and charming is she; 
In kind mood or cruel, she's always my jewel — 
My own darling Norah, sweet Norah Magee.

Isle of the ocean! my dear native land 
Unknown as a

Years of oppression thy children have known, 
Weary and languid, in sorrow, alone. 
Nations around thee in freedom and wealth, 
Flourish in commerce, her people in health; 
All save poor Erin, in sackcloth cast down, 
A

Erin, oh! Erin, I 
sigh for the day 
When thou shalt cast all thy burdens away; 
When thy old tyrant be driven again 
From every inch of thy pleasant domain. 
Freedom! blest angel — oh! smile on our land; 
Strengthen our children in heart and in hand; 
Speed on the day when no more we shall mourn; 
Heal our poor bosoms, liONY bleeding and torn, 
Help our brave sons while engaged in the fight, 
Teach all our children to do what is right— 
Pity our wretchedness, sorrows and tears, , 
All we have suffered for many long years. 
Erin, oh! Erin, & c. 
Aid us, oh Heaven! and grant us success — 
Deign to look down on our woful distress; 
Children around us in misery clad, 
Nought to relieve them, or make their hearts 
glad; 
Be with us, Father, whenever we meet, 
Aid us, we pray thee, our foes to defeat; 
Smile on our efforts as Thou didst before, 
Let Ireland be known as a 
nation once more.

This is somethin' in

Ah! sir, I'm afeered you'll

FATHER MALLOY. 
FATHER MALLOT. 
Words and Music published by OLIVER DITSON & CO., Boston 
Oh! Paddy McCabe was dying one thy, 
And Father Malloy he came to confess him; 
Oh, Paddy prayed hard he would make no delay, . 
But forgive him his sins, and make haste for to 
bless him. 
" 
First tell me your sins, then," says Father Malloy, 
" 
For I'm thinking you've not been a very good 
boy." 
"" 
says Paddy, " so late in the evening I 
fear 
"rwould trouble you — such a 
long story to hear; 
For you've ten long miles o'er the mountain to go, 
While the road I've to travel's much longer, you 
know. 
So give me your blessing and get in the saddle. 
To tell all my sins, my poor brain it would addle. 
And the doctor gave orders to keep me so quiet, 
'Twould disturb me to tell all my sins if I'd try it. 
And your reverence has told us unless we tell all, 
It's worse than not making confession at all. 
So I'll say in a 
word, I'm no very good boy. 
And now for your blessing, sweet Father Malloy." 
" 
Well I'll read from a 
Book," says Father Malloy, 
"The manifold sins that humanity's heir to, 
And when you hear those that your conscience an-
noy, 
You'll just squeeze my hand as acknowledging 
thereto." 
Then the father began the dark roll of iniquity, 
And Paddy thence felt his conscience grow ricketty; 
And lie gave such a 
squeeze that the pri est 
gave a 
roam'. 
" 
Och! murther!" says Paddy, " don't read any 
more. 
CI 
FATHER MALLOY. 
For if you keep reading, by all that is true, 
Your reverence's fist will be soon black and blue. 
Besides, to be troubled my conscience begins, 
That yOur reverence should have any part in my 
sins. 
'.4o you'd better suppose, I've committed them all; 
For, whether they're great ones, or whether they're 
small, 
Or if they're a 
dozen, or if they're fourscore, 
It's your reverence knows how to absolve them 
asthore. 
So I'll say in a 
word, I'm no very good boy, 
And now for your blessing, sweet Father Malloy." 
" 
Well," says Father Malloy, " if your sins I 
forgive, 
So you must forgive all your enemies truly; 
And promise me also that if you should live, 
You'll leave off your old tricks and begin to live 
newly." 
" 
I 
forgive everybody," says Pat, with a 
groan, 
"Except that big vagabond, Mickey Malone, 
And him I 
will murther if ever I 
can." 
" 
Tut', tut,"says the priest, " you're a 
very bad man: 
For, without your forgiveness and also repentance, 
You'll ne'er go to heaven, and that is my sentence." 
" 
Och ! " says Paddy McCabe, " that's a 
very hard 
case, 
With your reverence and Heaven I'm content to 
make peace; 
But with heaven and your reverence, I 
wonder, och 
hone ! 
You would think of comparing that scoundrel Ma-
lone. 
But since I'm hard pressed, and that I 
must forgive, 
I'll forgive if I 
die — but, as sure as I 
live, 
That ugly blackguard I 
will surely desthroy. 
And now for your blessing, sweet Father Malloy."

DARBY MAGUIRE. 
Some say 'twas in England I 
first saw the. 
light, 
And others in Scotland would have my first night; 
But,' as writers 'on heroes are often astray,

very well know, 
When the clergyman turAbled in, covered with snow; 
He laid hold of myself, and sat down by the fire, 
And made a 
good boy of young Darby M'Guire. 
Then hurrah for old Ireland, the land of my birth! 
'Tis there you'll get plenty of pleasure and mirth, 
Where the beautiful girls are sure to admire 
Such rollicksome fellows as Darby M'Guire. 
From christ'nings to weddings what heavenly bliss, 
As I 
stand by the bride and obtain the first kiss, 
While the creature looks sly as if nothing occurred, 
And the husband looks daggers, but daren't say a 
word; 
Och! then, for the carving of praties and pigs! 
The piper begins to " rattle the jigs," 
The girls they jump up and begin to perspire,. 
At the pleasure of dancing with Darby M'Gu ire! 
Then, hurrahl'or ould Ireland! etc. 
For twenty miles round at a 
market or fair, 
I'm sure to be found, if I 
don't be elsewhere; 
I'm just on the spot when a 
row is begun, 
And I'm smashing away for the sake of the fun; 
'Tis then that you'll 'see the big blackthorns all fly; 
Milla murther! you'd think 'twas a 
show'r from the 
sky! 
And who wins the battle? I 
never inquire; 
They're all " blood relations " to Darby M'Guire. 
Then, hurrah for ould Ireland! etc.

But, speaking of rows, I 
don't wish to offend; 
For, I'm always the boy to assist a 
poor friend; 
Though first in the " field" and not last in the 
" 
row," 
I 
can mind number one, and look after the plough. 
Some paint Ragged Pat with a 
villanous face, 
But I 
hope none of that in my own I

To see every man happy is all I

Contented and jovial, like Darby M'Guire.

IRELAND, THE LAND OF SHILLALAGH LAW. 
Och, Ireland the place is, for Grecians and graces, 
For sweetest of faces the world ever saw; 
For fighting genteelly and drinking too freely, 
Potatoes so mealy, and sweet as gasbaugh. 
Och! the paddies are rare ones, the ladies are fair 
ones, 
And no one there dare once say they are not. 
If Barfly were by now, his cudgel would fly now, 
And make him to fly now, as quick as a

cried," now how can you ride now, 
And have at your side now, such a

Or faith! I'll soon learn ye how to behave."

Pat's cudgel was handy, and though be was bandy, 
He was quite the dandy in love or a

It was quite a stopper, it stopped his mouth 
quite. 
His courage was all out, he murder did bawl out, 
"And why did we fall out, sweet Barny, my

" ° chi if you'd know why now, for Judy I'd die

Take that in your eye now, sweet Paddy, my boy." 
For I'm of the nation, etc. 
So Judy I 
caught her, but very soon after, 
She did die a 
martyr to whiskey, so strange ; 
There was a 
grand making at sweet Judy's waking, 
Light whiskey and cake in galore the night long. 
As Judy did lie now, her friends all did cry now, 
Och! why did you die now, and leave us to- night; 
Till, with liquor o'ertaken, we got to head breaking, 
And finished the wake in a 
row and a 
fight. 
For ,we're of the nation, etc. 
Mv name is Pat Murphy, I 
was born in Killarney, 
The sweetest of spots 'neath the Gem of the Sea,

ney, 
And faith they are as brave as the bravest can be; 
On the fifth of December they held a 
large meeting 
In Dublin's great city— but shure I'll not brag — 
Across the wide waters they sent us this greeting, 
Old Ireland is true to the American flag.

'
PAT MURPHY. 
At that meeting the chairman passed his resolution, 
Resolved that our countrymen were forced for to 
roam; 
On the American soil, a 
free institution, 
The right hand of Freedom, they there found a 
home ; 
A home with the right of a 
citizen gifted; 
Free from all tyrants they ever might be, 
And the hand of old Ireland shall never be lifted 
To strike a 
foul blow against the Flag of the Free. 
When the death and the famine were raging in our 
land, 
And those who should help, they quick turned their 
back, 
While thousands were dying in valley and highland, 
Who was it that sent us relief in a 
crack? 
It was the Americans, truly — old Ireland befriend 
her— 
Out Irishmen all in her troubles shall Share, 
And now on the field we march forth to defend her, 
luau Irish brigade, led by brave General Meagher. 
Now here's to the free land of freedom — God bless 
her — 
And here's to the might to the arm there dwelt, 
Too long we have fought to uphold the oppressor, 
The time is now come when we shall fight for 
. ourselves. 
Then off with the chain which our tyrants have 
wreathed us, 
And Liberty ever our watchword shall be, 
And the sword from the scabbard shall never be 
sheathed 
Till old Ireland becomes like America, free.

PADDY ROACH. 
As Emig by W. J. FLonExCr.. 
On the night coach, one morning, from Dublin so 
g4ly, 
I 
set off and walked every step of the way; 
. 
All the money I 
had was a 
thumping shillalah, 
Which brought me no more than a 
dirty half-pay. 
Och ! many a 
lad I 
have paid with it nately, 
Made him cry out for mercy, bawl out he was dead; 
Stole his cash, though he had none, then tripped off 
so swately, 
And knocked out his brains, though he had none 
in his head. 
Chorus. 
With whack, etc. 
I 
never shall forget, no, not while I 
remember, • 
The misfortunes that happened to myself, Paddy 
Roach; 
Summer weather it was in the month of December, 
When first I 
fell sea- sick a- top of the coach. 
I 
whispered aloud, " Take me back to the Liffey ; " 
They ne'er heeded my cries, but much faster did 
scud, 
When smack from the coach I 
was thrown in a 
And buried alive in a 
bog full of mud. 
Chorus. 
With whack, etc. 
Och! Paddy, said I 
to myself, as I 
lay in

Thou'rt kilt ! but however, get up, and don't stay in, 
But trudge back to Dublin, thy own native place.

Bad luck to the hour which first made me leave it,

But when I 
next do, faith, I'll ride on.my feet.

TERRY O'RANN. 
Sung by W. J. FLORENCE, with shouts of applause. 
Terry O'Rann was a 
fine young man, and from a 
boy 
it was his joy 
To tipple and drink, and lovingly wink at all the gay 
lassies in Derry ; 
And when his first love he was making, the girls for 
him had such a 
taking, 
If he'd just wink his eye, -och! wouldn't they sigh? 
You'd think all their backs was a-breaking. 
He took whiskey- punch every night to his lunch, all 
the thoughts of his love to bury, 
And then he would roam far away from his home, 
to the grief of the lasses of Derry. 
Day and night 'twas his delight to play this game 
without any shame. 
Till stopped by death, which took his breath, and 
killed him with whiskey in Derry. 
His loss to the lasses was grievous, but from death 
there is nothing can save us! 
And every soul in terror did howl. saying, ' Och ! 
Terry, why did yez leave us ?" 
That night at the wake every head did ache, and 
when they went with the coffin to bury, 
A crowd was seen that covered the green, in the 
black-looking churchyard at Derry, 
TERRY O'lLtXN.. 
71 
The mayor of the town was a 
man of renown, he 
was a 
shoemaker and a 
tailor, 
A 
baker, a 
doctor beside, and undertaker to all the 
people hi Derry; 
And when they were all merry-making, himself to 
his bed was taking, 
When Terry's deadghost stood at the bed-post, says 
he, ""fis a 
shame to the waking, 
Nor I 
don't ask your lave to come from the grave, 
your conduct is very shocking, och! very, 
I 
say to your face, you must alter my case, or I'll 
tell the people in Derry. 
"I was buried to- day, lint where I 
lay the ground 
was damp and gave me a 
cramp, 
All over my body the wet did get, there was water 
enough for a 
ferry, 
And besides, my feelings to harrow, I 
was doubled 
up as if in a 
barrow, 
I 
was wedged in tight- bound, I 
couldn't turn round, 
My coffin was too devilish narrow. 
It was made of had stuff, not half long enough, and 
as sure as my name was Terry, 
I 
will not lay quiet, I'll kick up a 
riot, I'll haunt all 
the people in Derry. 
" 
Pray," says the mayor, " now take a 
chair; if 
you'll allow, I'll measure you now 
For anew coffin longer, that's broader and stronger, 
if that'll make your heart merry." , 
Then the ghost brightened up in a 
jiffy, his frolic-
some spirits grew frisky; 
Says he," With pleasure you may take my measure, 
and I'll take a 
measure of whiskey, 
For you needn't he tould that the grave's very cold, 
and doesn't agree with poor Terry; 
I'm a 
comical elf, so I'll drink a 
good health to all 
the live lasses in Derry." 
/2 
TERRY O'RAN.N., 
While the bottle and g
. lass merrily pass, and Terry 
was ripe for a 
song *and a 
light, ' 
The clock struck one, and ended the fun of the frol-
icsome corpse of poor Terry, 
For the sound of the clock was a 
warning no ghost 
e'er was scorning; 
So, tipsy and drunk, away he slunk to get into his 
grave before morning; 
But the old women say that he missed his way, but 
they the coffin did bury, 
Which, quite empty, was 'found on the up-turned 
ground, to the grief of the lasses of Derry. 
The truth to suppose, for nobody knows, the ghOst 
ran hard to gain the churchyard, 
But to his distress, he got into a 
mess, by meeting 
some blackguards from Derry; 
Surrounded in every direction, no shinalah had he for 
protection, 
So they in a 
crack popped him in a 
sack, and car-
ried him off for dissection; 
lie told all the house he was but a 
poor ghoSt, but 
they wouldn't believe him, poor Terry! 
With hearts hard as stones, cut the flesh off his
