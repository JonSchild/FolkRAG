First real Italian grower Pasquale Saturno. Peddled vegetables by 
cart. Saturno said "I breen you vegetables ," so came to be known 
as "Breen." Great grandson Doug Breen changed named back to 
Saturno due to rise in Italian pride caused by Italian Heritage 
Association (IHA). Saturno had sent for young nephews, including 
Locatis & Arbinis . Later broke away & started own farms. 
Suggests talking to Maria Greco. She was a tailor & trained sons 
to be tailors. Grecos had local tailor shop & dry-cleaning shop 
in Walla Walla . RC remembers Mr. & Mrs. Greco sitting 
cross -legged on table sewing in tailor shop . Suggests talking to 
Nick Longo . Still speak broken English "after all these years." 
Longo was railroad man. Longo & RC's father worked on local 
railroad . Starbuck, WA (ca. 30 mi. N.E. of Walla Walla) leading 
railroad center. 
Re IHA: Ca. 12 people got together to start an association to 
help revive "customs & culture." RC saw announcement & went to 1 
of 1st meetings . Brought in attorney to write bylaws & 
incorporate . 1 of first things was to start adult dance group. 
Also decided to revive the language . 1st taught by Kate Cosper at 
Walla Walla Community College, but because of college fees, RC 
now teaches Italian free. Dorothy Criscola discovered on a recent 
trip to Italy that RC's teaching had helped her a lot. 
RC's background in education . Came to Walla Walla at age 6 from 
Los Angeles, Went to Eastern WA College in Cheney, WA. Then went 
to Columbia U. for Master 's. Most of career RC was director of 
instructional materials for Walla Walla Comm. School Dist.

far from Catholic schools went to public schools, such as Braden 
School south of Walla Walla.

encouraging Heritage Days at museum & setting up_displays. Fort

- Local 
al-i7an custom was to not "blow your own horn," but to live 
peacefully & quietly. Carmy Destito & Francis Christiano did most 
to start IHA. 
First IHA meeting called by Christiano & met at 
Ray & Lila LocatiIs house. IHA members are "Americans first, but 
PAraD©f'J 
we are proud of our heritage." Brought in attorney & a committee 
set up constitution & bylaws & incorporated IHA. RC volunteered 
•c'yaLzy 
to edit a newsletter which he still does. Needed as "organ of 
information." Puts an Italian lesson in it each time. Groups get\ 
together to make Italian pastries in local kitchens.- 
[CONTINUED ON SIDE B:) 
IHA meetings then moved from house to house. Some IHA women 
revived recipes from mothers & grandmothers. RC makes Danatoni  
(sweet bread) & gives away at Christmas. 
Explains how panatoni 
are made. Taught to non-Italians. 
RC suggested to IHA Board to

make Walla Walla Italian Heritage Cookbook, which is now out. 
"Some recipes never written down before. Some contributors had to 
watch how they were made & then record it. Contributors listed & 
in some cases province from which recipe came. Describes a blood 
jelly from pigs' blood. More description of cook book. 
Describes 
multifamily sausage-making days. 
RC born in Los Angeles suburb, moved to Walla Walla later. Father 
& mother married in Dayton, WA, lived in Starbuck while working 
for railroad. Discusses naturalization papers. RC's father first 
came to Chicago, then to Starbuck, WA (ca. 30 mi. N.E. of Walla 
Walla). Mother's father also worked on railroad in Starbuck. In 
1919 moved to Los Angeles from Starbuck. In 1931, mother & RC 
moved back to S.E. WA. 
Father had sent money home to relatives 
in Italy. Some Walla Walla Italian families visit families in 
Italy. Many have kept contact, except during the war years. Some 
early Italians came, made money, then went back & bought farms in 
Italy. 
Some had that goal but stayed in US anyway. Some came to 
U.S. to escape army service. Bea & Ben Eli a regularly have v is its 
from a Milanese relative who works for Alitalia. 
Gonzaga 
University (Spokane) has exchange program with schools in Italy & 
some locals have taken advantage of that. 
IHA has potlucks several times a year, featuring Italian dishes: 
salads, casseroles, pastas, risotto. Northern Italians use 
"saffron" (actually safflower) in rice. Charlie Paietta grows 
safflower. Italian men like to cook & are proud of cooking. RC's 
father great cook, taught RC to cook as a child. Mother cooked 
from memory. RC's meatballs & meat sauce different each time. 
IHA's Walla Walla Italian Heriage Cookbook has these things 
written down. 
Some women have made local costumes. Hoping to organize an 
Italian choir soon. Brings in a choir from Vancouver, B.C. for 
Italian Heritage Days. Children's dance group very popular in 
community, always being invited to dance publicly. Dance group 
discussed at meetings. Geraldine Magnoni Hartley director of 
dance groups. Mary Christiano Kleyn & Cheryl Landoni Knotts 
direct children's group. Jan Cristofoli Eaton (originally from 
Trail, B.C.) chair of Italian Heritage Days. Jan usually chairs 
princess & court committee. IHA open to all, not only Catholics, 
& not only old Walla Walla Italians. Some local Italians are 7th 
Day Adventists, because of College Place (& Walla Walla College) 
large Adventist community. Membership includes people outside of 
Walla Walla. Last year Jan Eaton chaired Heritage Days. Quick to 
"jump in" & lead. 
Walla Walla Italians pretty evenly divided between Northern 
Italians & Southern Italians, with few from middle. Northern 
Italians from Lonate Pozzolo & Southern Italians from Calabria &

BY BUTTICE.) 
Italian Heritage Association (IHA) meets Sunday. Importance of 
Italian contributions to Walla Walla Valley. Leading contribution 
is "Walla Walla Sweet Onion." Hard labor & sacrifices of Italians 
emphasized. Walla Walla Valley soil rich. Italians built many 
ti 
railroads in Pacific N.W. 
2 core areas of Italians in Walla Walla Valley: Near College 
Place mostly Milanese. Southern Italians settled mostly in "South 
9th Area," due south of Walla Walla. CD came to Walla Walla in 
'53. At that time Northern Italians sat on north side of St. 
Francis of Assisi Church, Southern Italians sat on south side.

1st generation suffered discrimination. Emphasizes their co-
4\operation & hardship. 2nd generation began buyi ng farms o f th e ir 
,•U 
own. After WWII many educated with GI Bill. 3rd generati on became 
Q` 
professionals & left farm. Main basis still agricultural. 1911 
•a Italians donated Columbus statue, same year Columbus Day legal 
holiday in WA. Whole town celebrated, although statue donated by 
Italians,Doug Breen restored family name Saturno. Italians had 
built St. Francis of Assisi Church because of anti-Italian 
feelings of other Catholics. St. F.A. Church established by 
Father (Oscar) Balducci (who was at that time chaplain at Fort 
Walla Walla Veterans Administration Hospital as a mission church. 
Dedicated in 1915. Present church built in 1939. 1916 Walla-Walla 
Gardener's Association (WWGA) established with John Arbini as 
president. At that time uneducated Italian gardeners being 
tt)W 665 
2 
underpaid for their produce, so WWGA established-in response. 
Many early Italians illiterate . WWGA oldest ..-produce house W. of 
Mississippi River still under original charter. Now some younger 
ones have established own plants. Jim Vinti present president of 
WWGA. His grandfather was one of charter members . Other families 
prominent in WWGA named & Board members. Manager of WWGA Bryon 
Magnaghi , grandfather also a charter member . 4 Joe Locatis in 
Walla Walla Valley. Jim Vinti has seen major changes in Walla 
Walla gardening , from hand to machine. 
CD raised in Spokane, WA. Came to Walla Walla Valley in 1945, 
when cousin married sister-in-law . Italians "loving, outgoing &• 
warm " to extended family members . CD's father was Canadian-born, 
who worked on railroad in US N.W. 
Italians can be reticent, 
f  
loyal, "but don't cross 'em!" 
1976 was the 70th anniversary of St. Francis of Assisi Church, 
Father Van der Heijden (the priest ) asked CD to develop 
celebration for church , which included rededication of Columbus 
statue. "Turning point " making it o.k. to be Italian again. 
Looked into possibility of establishing a Sons of Italy chapter 
in Walla Walla , but didn't work, as Walla Walla Italians too 
independent . In early 20th cent., Italians had some kind of 
lodge, possibly "Cristoforo Colombo Lodge ," but unaffiliated with 
any national organization . Not 'til later local Italians were 
involved in Knights of Columbus . CD chaired St. Francis of Assisi 
Church activities. At such an event in 1985, Francis Christiano 
stood up & said timing was right for establishment of an Italian 
heritage club, to do something for our heritage & our youth. 17 
people showed up for 1st organizational meeting. Covered by local 
paper. Wrote to every Italian family in Valley. Grew to over 100 
members 1st year. Downtown Main Street Foundation asked CD to 
start an Italian Heritage Days event . Saw this as opportunity to 
re-establish the Columbus Day parade. First festival organized in 
less than 2 months . Lots of support from local businesses & 
Chamber of Commerce . Have now had 4 festivals . In '76 had a 
church-sponsored social event for anniversary . In 1986, 1st

changes in Walla Walla Italian community. CD's nickname "Carmy" 
discussed. In Walla Walla, Italian foods not generally available 
unless made at home. Walla Walla Italians did not subscribe to 
Italian language newspapers. Community very isolated from other

for pipelines. EB doesn't know why they ended up in Walla Walla 
Valley. Parents & brothers came in early 20th Century, probably 
in the 1920s. 
CD's grandfather "Grandpa Spanish" (originally "Spagnuoli") moved 
back & forth & made money in US, with which he bought land in 
Italy. "Grandpa Spanish" made 7 or 8 trips back & forth. More on 
family members moving back & forth. Men coming & getting

Venneris had "nicest homes in neighborhood." Early Italians were 
railroaders, truck-gardeners, & coal miners. Many were ditch 
diggers. Many Chinese worked in Walla Walla Valley on railroad.

[FRANCIS CHRISTIANO DOES MOST OF THE TALKING, WITH OCCASIONAL 
COMMENTS BY NADINE CHRISTIANO] 
Italian Heritage Association (IHA) idea first began at program at 
•b 
DeSales Catholic Jr.-Sr. High School, 75th anniversary of St. 
Francis of Assisi Church. Carmy Destito chaired event. FC wanted 
to address group on idea of an IHA. Destito first volunteer. 
Described how first organizational meeting organized & held. Had 
been some interest in Italian heritage in years before. FC had 
previously asked people . Many said it was not possible because of 
friction-between 9th St. -&-south-area Southern.Italians & College 
Pl,ace-,&-northzarea-Nor,therm,-T,talians. 
Friction had prevented 
formation of organization years ago. Organization had been 
started in 1920s, but failed because of N-S friction. No Sons of 
Italy Lodge was ever in Walla Walla area. When IHA started, some 
suggested making it a Sons of Italy Lodge, but this was not what 
they had in mind , so IHA started as an independent organization. 
Sons of Italy from Seattle & Spokane approached them. One of 
Walla Walla Italians who had belonged to Spokane Sons of Italy 
suggested affiliation, but IHA members voted it down . Pros & cons 
discussed . Wanted a local organization . People opposed to dues to 
a national organization & sending delegates to national 
meetings. 
FC born & raised in Walla Walla area . FC's grandfathers were both 
gardeners. Father worked with grandfather working in gardens. 
Mother was Milanese , father a Calabrese . Friction between 
families. Father worked for produce companies after stopped 
\
working with grandfather . Eventually worked with Walla Walla 
Produce Co. 
Mother 's father had land near there, one of sons

stayed in it. That family bought into Liberty Pool Hall. FC 
worked for Continental Can Co. since 1943, worked for them most 
of life. In 1944 worked briefly for prune-packing house in 
Stateline, OR., where he met his wife. 
FC hated history in school. But in 1950s got very interested in 
local history from influence of local gun enthusiast with whom he 
hunted. Both were Western history enthusiasts. FC also Civil War 
buff. Started muzzle-loading association in Walla Walla in 1960. 
Continued interest in Western & NW. history. Interest in Italian 
history came later. FC's father played guitar & sang Italian 
songs. Families would sing Italian songs at family get-togethers 
& holidays. This sustained FC's interest in Italian heritage. FC 
wanted to revive old folksongs. As a child, he lived with 
grandparents, who spoke Italian all the time. FC spoke Italian 
(Calabrese dialect) as a small child. Visiting other 
grandparents, they would speak Milanese to him, so he learned 
both dialects. After family left farm, moved to town and lived in 
"Russiantown," German-Russian neighborhood at 10th & Willow in 
Walla Walla. But next door neighbors were the Spanish (formerly 
Spagnuoli) family, who were only other Italian family in that 
neighborhood. FC wanted to revive language, music. Father & 
cousin would do carnevale, moving party from house to house 
singing & playing at Christmas Eve. FC can only remember first 
line or two of old Italian songs. Looking for sources of these 
songs. Most of these songs Southern. 
Italian Father's songs 
J 
probably of "early vintage," as cannot be found nowadays. 
f 
Beginning of Italian language instruction at Walla Walla 
Community College. Later had Italian language classes in people's 
homes. FC taught it for awhile from tapes. Later taken over by 
Richard Campanelli. 
FC grew up with both Milanese & Calabrese cooking, because mother 
had to learn both, being Milanese & living with a Calabrese 
mother-in-law. Wife, Nadine Christiano, also learned to cook 
Italian (both Calabrese & Milanese) because lived with FC's 
parents in early years of marriage. Calabrese use much tomato 
sauce. Milanese use lots of rice. FC grew up eating both. 
Describes what they ate. NC describes rissoto & how made--recipe. 
["Saffron" is really safflower.] FC describes making of polenta. 
Grandparents had special copper Polenta kettle, which he 
describes. Describes serving of game broth with polenta. 
At one time almost all Italians in Walla Walla Valley made 
homemade wine. FC used to help his father. Zinfandel grapes 
ordered grapes from CA. 5 or 6 families would order truckload 
from CA through Walla Walla Produce Co. FC describes how wine was 
made. Would stomp grapes with r-ubbgN boots. More on how FC's 
father made wine, fermentation. Pure grape juice made best or

"first" wine . Second fermentation of mash with added cider to 
make "second " wine. "Second" wine would be drunk fresh while good 
wine was aging. Would also make wine for grandfather who was too 
ill. Some home wine making still done , but not in traditional way 
nor in the large batches. 
[CONTINUED ON SIDE B] 
When father had new house built , had part of basement left with 
dirt floor, to use for wine cellar . Restrictions on quantities & 
pressure during Prohibition made most Walla Walla Italians give 
up wine making . FC's father always had wine on table. [Figgins'] 
Leonetti Winery only Italian winery in area. 
1st Italian Heritage Days in 1985. In '76 a celebration of 
erection of Colubus statue, but FC not involved . FC founded local 
Civil Air Patrol in 1950. Describes local CAP. 
Retired from Continental Can Co . in 1980, went to work as 
volunteer at Fort Walla Walla Museum, & served on board of Fort 
Walla Walla Historical Society. Wife is active in Germans From 
Russia Organization . FC attended their meetings & decided 
Italians needed a similar organization . Mexicans had organization 
too. 
At museum, proposed Ethnic Days programs for museum--tried 
to get German-Russian group , Mexican group, Danish, 
French-Canadian & Chinese involved. This was around 1982 or -3.

not know it so many left. People who were left joined in on 
dancing . Activities limited by facilities. 
Joe J. Locati's book (The Horticultural Heritage of Walla Walla  
County, 1818 -1977 ) coming out in 1978 caused a lot of friction, 
because of factions who felt left out. Many Walla Walla Italians 
do not belong to IHA because of factional frictions & jealousy. 
Many didn 't join until year after IHA founded so missed charter 
membership.

[BERT PESCIALLO DOES MOST OF TALKING WITH OCCASIONAL COMMENTS BY 
ROSE] 
Father was G.D. "Joe " Pesciallo , was Genovese . Was a fruit 
farmer . His father came to Pendleton , OR., because someone paid 
his way . Worked a year for his passage. Bought land in Milton-
Freewater, came to present place in 1910, bought 40 aces of raw 
sagebrush land & developed it, building 2-room cabin. Grew 
strawberries & Rome beauty & winesap apples. Peddled fruit in 
vicinity with wagon & team. 
As BP grew up, father grew strawberries . Neighbors helped 
neighbors without pay. Groups co-operated on butchering hogs. 
Used to raise winesap , Rome beauty & stamen apples . Nowadays 
mostly Delicious , also aragals , Fujis, Granny Smith. His trees 
are Delicious . Also raises some plums . All his trees are "early 
sport" variety. Joe Pesciallo had gone back to Genoa to marry. 
Father kept $2,000 in gold because of Panic of 1907 not trusting 
banks. 
Family was mostly self-sufficient, raised own meat & chickens, 
bought flour. Didn't each much Italian food. Father raised grapes 
& sold to Italians in Walla Walla. Italians from Walla Walla 
would come out to Pesciallos by wagon on Sundays. Father raised 
mostly Black Prince grapes, a few tokays, a few malagas. Black 
Prince a good wine grape. Not as strong as zinfandel, some mixed 
Black Prince & zinfandel or used zinfandel for best wine. To make 
"dago red," added sugar to used, squeezed grapes. "Had to have a 
a 
'pretty good stomach' to get it ['dago red'] down." Father was 
•• 
given wine by his Walla Walla customers, but criticized how it

was made, Walla Walla Italians didn't use good barrels. Father 
made some wine for his own use. Didn't drink much wine, except 
once a day at noon. Pesciallos were raided but none found. Hidden 
under haystack. Describes 3 Federal officers coming with search 
warrant. Father sold lots of grapes (but no wine) during 
Prohibition. During Prohibition were his father's 
best grape-
selling years. Father would show people how to make wine from his 
grapes. 
BP helped his father make wine as a child. "Just grew up with 
it." Later started making wine in his own winery. Never used any 
preservatives, entirely natural. Started his winery (Blue 
Mountain Winery) in 1955. A Dr. H.Y. Yang of O eon State College 
gave him pointers-on-commercial wine making.

wine he made in 1937bttled it about 25 years ago, 
as iT-wa 
sbrink`iiq"'in- the- barerls. "Tastes just like velvet." 
Made all his wine with Black Prince, although experimented with 
mixing in some muscatel. Likes Black Prince wine better than 
zinfandel. Not as strong as zinfandel, but he likes it better. 
"Compares pretty much with zinfandel." Never mixed water with it. 
Father always said, "When you want to drink water, drink water, 
when you want to drink wine, drink wine." Never used water or 
made wine from water, squeezings, & sugar. Grapes were killed by 
a freeze in 1955 or 1957 . Gave up license in 1959. Federal 
Revenue agent from Seattle helped him set up licensing, showing 
him "short cuts first." Describes closing out & inventorying by 
Federal agents. 
,C• 
Describes wine making steps : Importance of a clean barrel. Always 
picked the grapes in best condition & quality. Pressed grapes 
fermented naturally. Would be picked around October 10, when 
sugar content was up. After fermentation, drew out wine & put in 
another barrel for aging . Whiskey barrels were the best to use, 
gave added flavor. Dr. Yang made several trips to Pesciallo's to 
give advice. Yang was a specialist in wine making at OR. State 
College. Didn't do it scientifically. Used natural yeasts, never 
added yeast to mash. Wine sold a gallon at a time. Bottled in 
,gallons & half-gallons. Had salesroom in shed at house. 
p'a.6 .,,•Ga e a 385-gallon barrel that his father had bought in Walla 
Walla 
to the Milton—Freewater Historical Society. 
Was shipped to 
Walla Walla with "whiskey from Spain." (?) 
Used cider press for 
pressing and rigged up an electric grinder. Never was big enough 
cbusinesss to-be°--anyth-irig -but a sideline

When Walla Walla Italians came to father's orchard to buy grapes, 
the Northern Italians & Southern Italians would take turns 
talking to him, because of clannishness between Northern Italians 
& Southern Italians. 
Father got along with both groups. BP 
understood Genovese dialect, but not real Italian. Father spoke 
national language-Italian to his Northern Italian & Southern 
Italian customers. Can still understand some Genovese, but not 
national language-Italian. 
Gary Leonetti Figgins & Rick Small, Walla Walla commercial wine 
makers came to BP for advice. Sold his French 
glass ebulliometer  
(measures alcohol -content) to Small. 
[CONTINUED ON SIDE B:] 
Has visited Small's winery recently. Glad to see earnestness of 
Figgins & Small, and that they won some prizes. Federal law lets 
you run the wine 3 times from the same grape pomace base. Good 
wine doesn't give you a headache. BP had a "Farmer's Winery" 
license, so he couldn't buy grapes, could only use his own. Was 
selling grapes at the same time. Figgins planted some of his test 
grapes on BP's property. Black Prince was both a good wine grape 
& a good table grape. 
European wine grapes won't stand temp below -5 °. American grapes, 
such as concord, Niagara, or s lip s ki ns can stand severe freezes. 
If it freezes 1 in. below ground, the sudden thawing will kill 
the plant. Would bury grapevines if a heavy freeze expected. 
Still buys grapes to eat. 
Used to occasionally attend St. Francis of Assisi Church in Walla 
Walla. Has not yet gotten around to joining Walla Walla Italian 
Heritage Association. 
Mrs. Pesciallo is from College Place, WA. 
Her family Milanese. He could not understand Milanese dialect. 
They go to Italian Heritage Days events at Fort Walla Walla 
Park. 
Old people from old country made & drank a lot of wine. Next 
generations drink very little wine. Mrs. Pesciallo's father made 
several barrels a year. BP's father didn't drink it very much, 
nor did he. Talks about his gallons of 50-year-old wine.

Text: 
(RECORDING HAS A FLAW: RECURRING BACKGROUND NOISE SERIOUS 
ENOUGH TO DROWN OUT INTERVIEW.) [LOUIS IS THE FATHER, GREG THE 
SON & MANAGER OF BOSSINI PACKING CO.] 
Louis Bossini: Bossinis have been in onion-growing business since 
1916. Farm started by his father Carl. Came to Walla Walla to 
make a living & start a new life. Father worked in a sugar mill 
in California. 
[NOISE PROBLEM] 
Father raised onions, spinach, radishes, carrots, & "bunch 
stuff." In 1927 bought 7 acres near Walla Walla. Moved his house 
there from College Place. Mother died. Father & sisters raised 
him. Grew up helping him on the farm. Would cut asparagus before 
school. 
[NOISE PROBLEM] 
Father couldn't drive tractor or truck, so quit farming until LB 
came back from WWII. 
Used to raise lots of "bunch stuff," carrots, radishes, beets, 
turnips, green onions. 
[NOISE PROBLEM] 
Raised other vegetables to give them more to live on in various 
seasons.

r 
Went to onions because price more predictable in 1950s. LB took 
over farm in early '50s. Early days work done by hand & with 
horses . Families did the work . Hired hands didn't come in 'til 
late 1940s . In early days direct-seeded onions in late 1930s 
started transplanting . In 1972 went back to direct-seeding, 
because of labor costs. 
Describes & defines direct-seeding and transplanting --how and 
when done. 
Greg Bossini : As acreage got bigger , too much labor cost in 
transplanting. 
LB: Originally went to transplanting so they could raise two 
crops, such as a spinach crop & an onion crop . Describes how & 
when done . With direct seeding can only raise one crop. 
Describes seed-onions out there now. 
Changes in harvesting described . Used to be field-packed and 
-graded . Sizes checked with a ring . Then went to boxes, graded in 
warehouse . Then to using bins , with hired help. 
GB: Describes dimensions of bags , boxes, & bins . Changes in bags, 
boxes, & bins described . Who did it & when. Went to bins in late 
1960s . Less labor in bins. Bins loaded by tractor . "Walla Walla 
<
-Sweets " still loaded by hand, because of fragility. Yellow or 
winter onions loaded by machine . Winters are hybrids & are 
machine - harvested now, as of this year. Describes how topped, 
lifted, windrowed , and loaded . Winter onions topped by machine. 
"Walla Walla Sweets " still topped by hand . Clipping of roots on 
"Walla Walla Sweets." Competition with TX & GA for 
"clean-looking " onions . Describes how windrowing done . Left out 
1-2 weeks to dry out . Used 
windrow by hand. "Walla Walla Sweets" 
are 90 % moisture. Winter onions are 85 -6%, so "Walla Walla 
_Sweets" too delicate for machines . Too much bruising. 
"'- Term, "Walla Walla Sweets " first used in late 1940s. Mostly 
called that locally . Late '50s & early '60s term started to be 
used in marketing elsewhere . "Walla Walla Sweet Onion Commission" 
(WWSOC ) founded to combat growers in other areas who called 
theirs "Walla Walla Sweets ." Founded around '81. WWSOC has 
specific standards, established a USDA-grade standard. Packers 
encouraged growers to harvest too early, giving immature onions & 
tarnishing reputation. WWSOC set up 3-man committee to o.k. when 
ready . Now has one checker, who is LB.

says "Genuine Walla Walla Sweets." 
GB: High demand for "Walla Walla Sweets" in last 10-12 years. 
Another sweet onion has been developed recently in Brooks-area 
near Salem, OR., called a "Willamette Sweet," but gave little 
competition. "Walla Walla Sweet " is unique by being an--
open-pollinated onion, not a hybrid . Developed from/Corsican"" 
ancestor . Other sweet onions are hybrids. 
LB: Used to be different varieties of "Walla Walla Sweets." Now 
standardized & improved . Used to have lots of onions if they got 
too mature . Thrown out. Very few doubles , whites, or reds now. 
GB: Demand for "Walla Walla Sweets" increased in recent years. 
Caused by WWSOC 's marketing. Before that only Seattle & Portland 
consumers knew them . Now demand comes from East Coast , Southeast, 
California, & Alaska . Shipped all over the U.S. Feels market 
could be expanded . "Walla Walla Sweet " growing area very small, 
compared to TX . & Vadalia,_ GA. 
Onl 
about 700 acres of "Walla 
Walla Sweets " grown . 
(Most advertisign'to chain-store &-•

"Walla Walla Sweet " 
growing area strictly defined. 
Includes some of Umatilla Co., OR . Bounded by hills north & 
south , Blue Mountains to east, and west as far as Touchet, WA 
(ca. 18 mi . w.). Milton-Freewater as far south as boundary goes, 
ca. 10 miles south & 18 miles west. Bossinis grow some of theirs 
in OR . Fungus disease , "white rot ," came into area in 1950s. Hard 
to control , so they abandon ground & move plantings around. Spore 
stays in soil. 
People have tried to grow "Walla Walla Sweets" elsewhere, but 
without success . Walla Walla area has right soil, seasons & 
climate . Walla Walla Valley is warmest part of eastern WA. 
February '89 freeze had some effect. Snow cover saved it. 1969 
freeze was the worst , with no snow cover & high winds. Most 
onions killed in '69 . In '89 had more diseases, due to weakening 
by cold . 1989 had inconsistent spring. More on climate in area & 
surrounding WA. 
LB: His father was one of original Walla Walla Gardeners' 
Association (WWGA ) charter members . LB left in 1970, GB in '69. 
WWGA more mechanized now. Built new big warehouse in 1975. Were 
going to raise lots of carrots , but did not pan out. Stores lots 
of onions. WWGA changed from co-operative to a shareholders 
association. 
GB: Was in WWGA for ten years, but left , because since it had no 
stock, being a co-operative , old farmers had nothing to show for 
resources put in.

GB felt some assets should be realized back, so started own

WWGA now a stockholder corporation. Changed so 
there would be assets left over for retirees. 
LB: Growers were putting own money into WWGA & not getting 
anything back. 
GB: In old days winter onions were "Sweet Spanish" type, now 
raises several varieties of hybrid winter-onions. Many raised for 
processing. Bred for long shelf-life. 
Most winter onions grown 
today are not sweet.'"Walla Walla Sweets" not a cooking onion,

how stored until Sept, then reset (description), covered, in

Can taste the difference between Walla Walla Valley-grown 
root crops , from same seed-stock, if grown elsewhere. May not 
look as good, but best taste comes from Walla Walla -- especially 
carrots & asparagus & "Walla Walla Sweets." Today's consumers 
cannot tell the difference in taste . Complains about tomato 
quality . Describes wholesaler in Tacoma, WA who 
specializes in 
high-quality products . Seed companies are developing hybrids that 
will winter over. They will eventually be raised more , as will be 
in demand by buyers for their shelf-life . Walla Walla growers 
need to get to consumer for marketing . Seattle & Portland areas 
have promoted "Walla Walla Sweets." Occasionally articles appear 
in other parts of the country . Have been featured in N.Y . Times. 
A Palo Alto , CA. banker gives Bossini 's "Walla Walla Sweets" to 
his favored customers. 
LB: 
In early days raised the other crops too. 
GB: 
Bossini is diversified . In '85-7 raised 3380 acres of 
onions . Now about 100 acres . Grew some asparagus 'tit last fall. 
Still grows beans , spinach, sugar peas, zucchini, carrots . Onions 
are main crop. Non-onion crops not grown for consumer , but for 
processing . Quit asparagus because of labor cost. New regulations 
have raised cost of labor. 
LB: 
In CA lettuce cut by hand , but put on conveyor & packed by 
machine . Walla Walla can't compete with CA where crops raised 
year-round , which is what buyers want. 
GB: 3-4 different varieties of asparagus raised in Walla Walla 
Valley . New variety called "Jersey giant ." All male, no females. 
A very expensive hybrid seed . Asparagus varieties grown locally: 
"Mary Washington ," 500W, and two WA State Univ. hybrids. Old 
farmers north of College Place grow a lot of asparagus . Main core 
of "Walla Walla Sweets" was north of College Place . Now growing 
there mostly small, retired , part-time. 
LB: Suggests I talk to Virgil Criscola. 
GB: Criscola has his own small packing operation.

Jim Vinti third generation Walla Walla Italian-American grower. 
All 3 generations raised onions . Other crops, too. Father raised 
3•c••N 
lettuce, beets , carrots, cabbage, etc. Grandfather did too . 
o rs•a • 
Farmed at same place. Also rented other land. Family was from 
/
C,i- 
Southern Italy, half Sicialiano, half Calabrese. 
,,ov.r4 
Grandfather was charter member of Walla Walla Gardeners' 
\ 
Association (WWGA ). Most Italians involved in WWGA, a strong 
association . Some growers went independent , but most stayed witl 
WWGA. Today thirty active growers in WWGA. Younger generation 
less interested in farming . Today WWGA is mostly an onion- & 
asparagus -packing service. Used to sell other vegetables, too. 
Now just "Walla Walla Sweet onions ," winter onions, & asparagus. 
WWGA always had own packing plant. New warehouse built 10-12 
years ago. Most modern packing facility in area . Describes old & 
new WWGA buildings . WWGA still predominantly Italian. 
Only a fe 
non-Italians are members. 
Describes change from co-operative to corporation & reasons why. 
Stock issued to people putting money into it. People can now 
recoup investments by selling stocks when retired . JV president 
of 7-person Board of Directors . One woman on Board . She also 
raises asparagus & onions . WWGA still packs a few radishes & some 
romaine lettuce , but is mainly onions & asparagus. Can't compete 
with CA growers on crops other than onions & asparagus.

Doesn't remember when onions first called "Walla Walla Sweets."--••`•

standards . Have to be grown in area to be "Genuine Walla Walla

EAW-Si--A-wcva(6 
Sweets ." Established in early 1980s. Objectives of WWSOC 
described . WWSOC has own logo. More & more buyers are asking for 
"Genuine Walla Walla Sweets " with logo . WWSOC set-up described. 
WWSOC assesses growers so much per sack to pay for services. 
WWSOC has rules & regulations packers must abide by to certify 
"Genuineness." Describes the Walla Walla, WA, Tri-Cities 
(Kennewick , Richland, Pasco ), WA & Milton-Freewater, OR packers 
in WWSOC. Louis Bossini hired to inspect "Genuine Walla Walla 
Sweets '" quality at packing sheds. 
Onions have to meet USDA requirements & onions not packed too 
green. Makes sure of use of logo, & onion must be up to quality. 
Bossini has authority to stop packer, if quality not up to 
standards. 
Describes territory in which they must have been 
grown to be "Genuine Walla Walla Sweets": All of Walla Walla 
County & part of Umatilla County, OR. 
Some people have 
experimented with planting "Walla Walla Sweets" elsewhere. WWSOC 
logo is a Registered Trade Mark . Are tightening regulations for 
origin of onions vis-a-vis Federal regulations . "Walla Walla 
Sweet 's" taste changes if grown elsewhere. Are other sweet onions 
elsewhere . Other sweet onions are hybrids . "Walla Walla Sweets" 
are open-pollinated onions . Have own taste & shape , highly 
perishable . Harvested June 15 through August 10 (August 1 
preferred ). Break down because of high sugar content. Vadalia, GA 
sweet onions have longer shelf -life . Walla Walla packers have 
experimented with increasing shelf-life of "Walla Walla Sweets." 
Some people wrap onions individually to keep. Are sometimes tied, 
separated by a knot, in pantyhose & kept in cool , dry place. This 
seems to work. "Walla Walla Sweets " are shipped all over U.S. &• 
Canada . Some have been shipped to Hawaii & experimentally, by 
airfreight , to Japan. Japanese pay top dollar for high-quality 
produce. 
Has seen lots of changes in growing & selling of onions, although 
only 40 years old. Remembers when they were transplanted. Father 
would seed hotbed August 26. Would transplant in October when 6-7 
inches tall . Describes how transplanted by hand. Now they are all 
direct-seeded, all planted by September 10 with a 
precision-seeder . Describes how. JV grows own seed, by picking 
out bulbs from harvested crop . All done by hand. Seeds harvested 
in mid-August, description of how they are harvested . Used to 
grade, size , & sack onions in field. Now hauls them to plant in 
bins, where packed . Describes how onions are harvested --" Walla 
Walla Sweets " hand topped , lifted with lifter . Uses Mexican 
crews. They come at 5-6 p.m. & work 'til dark. Cut onions & put 
them in windrows . 8 rows is a tier. Next morning come back at 
dawn & cut 'til 8-9 o'clock. Onions lay on ground 10-12 hours. 
Then fill tote -bins & let air in field one more whole day to dry. 
This dries roots.

Much asparagus grown in area. JV grows very little asparagus. 
Used to grow more . It is too labor-intensive. Cost of labor is 
too high, raising costs. "Walla Walla Sweets" too perishable to 
harvest other than by hand . JV also grows winter onions. They are 
hand-topped, but loads mechanically . Winter onions are a hard 
onion , a hybrid, can stand more abuse. 
WWGA has gone from a co -operative organization to a corporation. 
Now it is a large, completely mechanized facility. 9 or 10 
full -time employees . When asparagus are packed , with day & night 
crew, have 2-300 people on payroll . Are presently packing winter 
onions & peeling white onions for resale . Hybrid winter onions 
planted in March & harvested in August, September , & October 
Planted from seed. 
[CONTINUED ON SIDE B] 
Hybrid winter onions have been grown for many years. Grown 
supplementary to "Walla Walla Sweets ." His father grew some in 
old days . Used to sell to hospital . Used to trade potatoes & 
onions to hospital for baby-delivery costs . JV sells some "Walla 
Walla Sweets " directly to consumers from home. 
Family kept some Italian customs . Sisters & sisters -in-law still 
bake Italian at"•Chr 
stams•: East

customs . Grandfather &"'father used to make wine . Had wine-press. 
WWGA used to order grapes from CA. for its members. Used to be a 
lot of wine barrels in cellars along Lower Milton Rd. Home wine 
making has died out in Walla Walla area. Figgins of Leonetti's 
Cellars winery may be only Italian-American still making wine. 
CWWGA in old building had a grocery store, sold It a li an 
R 
specialties , such as spaghetti , macaroni, fish, salamis, cheeses 
to Italian-American members . Had grocery credit plan, which kept 
growers fed during seasons when money not coming in. WWGA's 
grocery closed about 20 years ago. 
Major change in area is the limitation of crops to onions & 
asparagus . Younger generation wants to concentrate on one major 
crop . Easier for WWGA to handle those two crops , as set up for 
them. Cost of labor also major change . Change from hand labor to 
mechanical . Father would be dumbfounded to see how crops handled 
today. WWGA has manager & sales-manager, all computerized. "They 
were never that busy when they had to write it all by hand." 
WWGA 's new building not worked to capacity. Describes numbers of 
units packed . A few younger ones just getting into growing. Larry 
Arbini 's boys going into horticulture. Most younger 
Italian-Americans have gone into professions . JV's brothers &

{ 
Cycle is one or two good years, then a couple bad years, then 
level out to average years, then return to good years. Onions' 
economic cycle never constant -- either up or down. Few "average" 
years. Depends on weather & supply-and-demand . 1989 good year for 
prices, but crop low due to 1989 winter damage . Previous year 
(1988 ), prices way too low . 1987 a bonanza year. 1986 "basement" 
year . Every other year good or bad. 1990 may be a bad year. Used 
to be in early July Walla Walla growers only ones who had onions, 
now competition coming in during that period too . Some local 
growers have been totally wiped out, including a neighbor two 
years ago . Some local wheat ranches have been bankrupted by bad 
farm economy. 
.Father's side of family all farmers . Mother 's side were 
orchardists . Stress of economic uncertainty . JV also raises 
carrots, beans , wheat, & cattle . Diversifies so won't be too 
dependent on any one crop. Other younger farmers are now 
diversifying , raising beans, spinach, &_carrots . JV raises 70 
acres of onions a year. In Walla Walla Valley that is a large 
crop . Used to raise 40-50 acres "Walla Walla Sweets" & about 100 
acres of hybrids . Too many onions & not enough demand. Excess 
hybrids stored in WWGA warehouse. JV has been president of WWGA 
for ten years . Have had same officers for long time . Decisions 
made by votes of Board . WWGA a close-knit group. Ca. 50 members, 
with about 25 active growers . Rest are retired or semi-retired 
who bring in a few onions now & then. WWGA also buys asparagus 
from outside organization. Also does this with onions, if have 
surplus capacity during season . Members come first. "Works pretty 
smooth ." Also a Walla Walla Grain Growers ' Association , Alfalfa 
Seed Growers ' Association, and Cattlemen 's Association. WWGA 
closest-knit organization. Most Italians who came into valley 
became farmers. 
JV's grandfather was a carpenter by trade . Settled & worked in 
Chicago, but when came to Walla Walla Valley, took up farming. 
JV's father & his brother-in-law built Vintis ' house about 40 
years ago. 
The Italians who settled south of Walla Walla "ventured out 
more, " & had bigger operations . Group north of College Place 
stayed small , but were more numerous . At one time were all 
involved with WWGA . Cigars were always passed out at WWGA 
meetings.

Text: [VIRGIL CRISCOLA DOES THE TALKING WITH OCCASIONAL COMMENTS 
Y DOROTHY CRISCOLA.] 
Has been onion-farming since 1946. Father was onion-grower too. 
Hasn't regretted it a bit. Father was born in N.Y. City. 
Grandfather came west to Walla Walla to look for gold & was 
related to Pasquale Saturno, who invited him to Walla Walla to 
work if he didn't find gold. So he worked for Saturno, then went 
back to N.Y. for awhile. Was fruit-peddler on N.Y. City streets 
but had problems with gangs, so he moved back out west. Had 10 
kids, 5 girls, 5 boys. All boys had only one child. Girls of 
family had more children. So VC had no brothers or sisters. 
Grandfather from island of Ischia, off Salerno. Were fishermen. 
Went to a place where they knew somebody, so went to Walla Walla, 
because related to Saturno. Knew no-one on coast, where he could 
have fished, so went into farming. 
•-Early Italians saved enough money working for others to buy a few 
acres to start on their own. This was top priority. With cow to 
make cheese & butter & barrel of homemade wine, raising own 
vegetables, "that's all they wanted." Survived on soup. Everybody 
had pig, cow, chickens. VC remembers old-timers making lard & 
putting it in crocks, & packing sausage in lard crocks to keep. 
Would even keep in summer. People ate lots of fat & cholesterol, 
"practically wallering in it." All Italians lived about the same 
\. way. 
Walla Walla had 2 different Italian colonies, "Northern Colony" 
of Milanese, & "Southern colony" of mainly Calabrese, groups 
settled separately. Northerners who married Southerners were

disgraced. Criscolas not really part of this as they were from 
northern part of southern Italy. His family from Castelmare di 
Stabia (?), north of Sorento. 
Only 5 or 6 Neapolitan-area 
families in Walla Walla. Walla Walla pretty equally divided 
between Northern Italians & Southern Italians. Saturno was 
Southern Italian, but didn't bring many Southern Italians to 
Walla Walla. 
When VC started high school in 1938, also worked at grocery 
store. Saturday night worked til 1 a.m. cleaning & unloading 
vegetable racks. Grocery work helped VC with "being able to meet 
people." Farm life too isolated & social contacts limited. 
'Trend in farming today to larger operations, caused by 
mechanizing. Back when he started in 1946, ten acres of onions 
was a large farm. Nowadays need 50, 60, or 100 to get by. Trend 
from hand labor to mechanization. Doesn't believe bigger 
operators really making any more money than they did when they 
did all the work themselves. Old-timers had large families for 
free labor. People nowadays "farm from the pickup," watching 
everybody else (hired) working. Walla Walla area has had farm 
bankruptcies in last 2-3 years. Never heard of before. Italian 
community never had people on welfare, because of pride. People 
don't have pride they used to have. People were poor, but made it 
anyway. Bought first pair of corduroy pants as freshman in high 
school. 
Tells story of his first pair of cords: Saved money & went to 
Ward's. Went by himself. Tried on in dressing room. Left wallet 
with $4 in dressing room. Someone else went in & out of dressing 
room. When VC, returned his wallet was gone, & money. "The world 
came to an end." Confronted the other man & got the money back. 
Now always takes his wallet with him when trying on pants. "That 
was a great lesson!" 
^
VC's father was not in Walla Walla Gardeners' Association (WWGA), 
but grandfather was. Father wanted freedom to sell things on his 
own. Many left WWGA. But fifteen years ago, VC joined WWGA, 
because needed solidarity on prices. Is not active anymore. 
Raises small crop & retails it himself from a stand. Hires 
grandson in summer, but does most of work himself. 
Years ago irrigated by ditch, but since WWII had had overhead 
irrigation. Hard to establish new practices because old-timers 
fought new practices. Were always 20 years behind the times. Hard 
to change things because old-timers were successful. VC's father 
tolerated him modernizing. Uses Allis-Chalmers G cultivating 
tractor. Not built since 1955, but still best tractor for 
vegetable cultivation. Walla Walla last area to use them, in 1954 
or 1955. Then when adopted, new ones no longer available. People

went to buy used ones around the country . More Allis Chalmers G's 
in Walla Walla area than any other area in U.S. Many bought two 
or three of them . Went from hand-cultivating to hand walk-behind 
tractor , Planet Junior to Allis Chalmers G. Similar ones made 
today , but not as good. 
In old days 4-7 acres were large operations . Raised onions, 
lettuce, green onions, turnips, beets, carrots , asparagus. More 
diverse then. Not financially sound enough to take a chance on 
one big crop . Also provided food for family. Father started out 
with 5 acres in 1925. Paid $1,000 per acre. Wasn 't paid off until 
1947 . Had a truck before a car . Got truck in 1926 . Got a car in 
1933 . When VC came into business, bought more acreage. Today VC 
has 18 acres. When VC farmed more intensely , he rented 20-30 
acres down the road . Locals don 't want to sell small farms, 
because, "It came hard & we want to hang on to it." His two sons 
have no desire to farm . Were good workers as kids, but are not 
interested . Education caused sons to lose interest in farming. 
Nowadays, with fewer farmers , production is still greater because 
of larger farms. 
More asparagus is raised on the small plots north of College 
Place, because "asparagus natural thing to grow wh en you 're 
retired." Most of these little <10-acre plots are owned by 
retirees . Asparagus (a perennial ) gives more leisure time to 
travel. VC doesn't raise asparagus , because he hated cutting it 
as a kid . Had to get up early to cut it, & went to sleep in high 
school class & was berated by teacher . "Soured on asparagus." So 
just raises onions. 
Many have left onions because of "white rot" fungus disease. Best 
onion-growing area in country, but many plots can't grow it 
because of disease . The north of College Place area, called 
"Blalock area ," settled by Northern Italians. 
Blalock had been 
orchard & had good mulch in soil because of leaves dropping & 
tree roots . Had been an 8-900 -acre orchard started by a Dr. 
Blalock . When sold off in 1920s, Northern Italians bought it up 
an acre or two at a time . Would pull trees out & cultivate land, 
which was very rich & productive. Hauled manure all winter from 
wheat ranches ' 
horses & mules. Soil is fantastic . VC now rotates 
Austrian peas with onions, tries to avoid using too much chemical 
fertilizer . Tries to make it produce naturally. 
"White rot " started in 1949 . At first, didn't pay much attention, 
swept through Walla Walla Valley & put most onion-farmers out of 
production . So growers started renting land out of town that had 
not been in onions , but it was not as productive . Had to learn 
how to farm that land, which was high-clay . Called "farming the 
highway." VC & others who stayed on local small plots fumigate, 
covering entire acreage with tarp & pumping in fumigant. Costs

$1,200 per acre . This has saved them. Plot in back of his house 
is fumigated about every three years. Can sometimes get five. 
Describes how done . Company in Vancouver , WA does it for them, 
tractor rolls down plastic and injects methyl bromide gas into 
soil. When covered with plastic looks like water so ducks & geese 
will try to land on it. Very expensive but cost-effective as it 
saves renting & commuting & weed-killing costs. Fumigating also 
kills weed seeds . Worth it for 3-5 acres, but not for a big 
operator , so they just move on.

VC does his own packing. Raises about 5 1/2 acres. Packs 70-80% 
of own. Sells it retail from the house & has roadside stands 
around area . Bossini has to grow large crops to keep his packing 
plant going . When VC harvests, he hires local kids. Is last 
farmer to do this . Starts them age 13 & works them until 16, when 
they try other jobs. Some stay til 18 because they like the work. 
Hires a crew of about 12 or 13 kids, from 6 a.m. til about 1 p.m. 
VC tries to teach them something, too. Is like being a 
scoutmaster . VC uses mostly field boxes instead of bins . Have to 
start crop a little--on green side,•so they won't be overripe when 
harvesting finished . Gets better curing from field box. Bin holds 
24 field boxes. Filed box holds 30 -35 pounds . Slatted, has lots 
of air movement . Stacked about 5 high. Gets better drying on 
early harvesting . They hand top, then windrow. 
Describes kids ' 
workday during harvest season . First thing at 6 
a.m. they top 4 or 5 100 -foot windrows. Onions were lifted 
mechanically , with a "lifter," the night before . It cuts the 
roots . Tops them by hand with a specia 
knife similar to a paring 
knife . At 8:30 will start running them othre 
the grader , leaving 
the topped ones to sit . Do that for an hour, then break for pop. 
"You gotta treat a kid like a kid. You can't treat 'em like an 
adult and that 's how you get the work out of 'em." Finish grading 
about 10:30 -11. Then go back out & pick up what topped in 
morning, stack them up, & leave 'tit next day. Load from day 
before is then loaded on truck . Onions only stay in windrows 4-5 
hours. If left through afternoon they can sunburn in the 100 °-
weather . They cook at 98 °, because "Walla Walla Sweets " tender 
from high water-content, 94 -5% water. Sun will damage. Just want 
sun to dry up dirt & roots , so it shakes off. Will cure in bin or 
box out in the field . Stay out there overnight . In afternoon all 
ar under cover. Put an empty box on top of stack of 5 to keep sun 
off. Has small grader in shed, sets it all up in summer. 
In shed he stores bagged onions for retail customers . Most of 
advertising by "word of_mouth ." Granddaughter, age 10, sells 
onions out of shed at house . She stays in house looking out 
window for customers. There are signs around pointing to VC's. 
She makes spending money that way. At first was very shy, but 
then caught on. Family has built-in salespeople . Tries to keep

-A 
business in the family. This "goes back to our heritage." 
Old-timers, including Tachi & Saturno, lent money to other 
Italians. Italians had own baking system. Never went to real bank 
to borrow money. Weren't educated & didn't trust anybody but 
fellow Italians. 
In 1940, VC's father bought new Chevrolet for $900. VC had just 
gotten his license. VC had a fender-bender accident & was afraid 
to go home. Told his father. Father sent him to Chevrolet garage 
on way to school for repair. Bill was $3 & some cents. Dad told 
him to charge it, but didn't have charge account. So he phoned 
home & father raised hell, so they let him have the car. "They 
[Italians] didn't understand charging & all that stuff." If they 
bought anything, saved money first, then went to buy it. Father 
paid for Chevy with $900 cash. Describes first refrigerator they 
had. 
WWGA had own store for members, with bulk foods, as large 
families needed. Members could charge in winter against future 
crop deliveries. "One of the reasons WWGA was so successful." 
This kept people in WWGA. This was the only means of charging 
they were comfortable with. Comparable to bartering. Music 
instructors also took barter. They trusted music-teacher Prof. 
[Frank] Giovinazzo because he was Italian. 
Taught accordion, 
violin, trumpet. If he had wanted cash for kids' lessons, fathers 
would have said they couldn't afford it, but if payable in 
onions, fathers thought it was o.k. "Thinking kind of funny. 
Wouldn't come up with money, but product was same as money." 
Maternal grandmother lived to be 98, despite all the lard she 
ate. Good hard work. In old days, men quit work 1 p.m. Saturdays, 
get cleaned up, go to town to tavern & have a beer or two. Beer 
was a treat, because they had all the wine they wanted at home. 
Not many abused wine, only a few. All would go to town, do their 
shopping, put on Sunday clothes on Saturday. Sunday morning would 
go to church, then congregate al old folks' place. Million kinds

outhern Italian sausage has fennel seed, Northern Italians don't 
use fennel seed. Southern Italians use hot chili pepper. Northern 
Italians use white pepper. They like blander sausage. Genoa 
famous for its hard salami. Basic spices varied according to 
taste. VC made 60 pounds the other day, just for VC & 
brother-in-law. Made during December. Not dried like it used to 
be. Made fresh & frozen. Buys a 65-1b. case of pork butt. Take 
out as much fat as possible. Grinds, mixes it, then stuffs into 
casings & lets hang for a day. Casings now easier to get because 
of sausage-making trend. Wine making trend nowadays too, but not 
among Italian-Americans. 
Gets imported Danish casings from 
Seattle. Describes how casings cured. Old-time Italians always 
had a dirt-floor cellar for wine- & sausage making. Saturnos 
built wine cellar before they built their house. "That was a top 
priority for the wine & the sausage and salami. They would live 
in a tent, but they built that thing first." 
,--VC's family still make Italian Christmas cookies. Don't make 
other typically Italian Christmas foods, though. In old days, the 
Christmas Eve specialty was bacala (?) 
(dried salt cod), when 
Christmas Eve was fast day. Bacala described. Bacala not liked by 
younger generation. Italian-Americans in Walla Walla area still 
celebrate Christmas on Christmas Eve. VC didn't know that most 
"Americans" celebrate it on Christmas Day. They also have a big 
dinner on Christmas Day these days, but present-opening & dinner 
_ for family is still on Christmas Eve.

VC is a musician . Learned music from Professor [Frank] Giovinazzo 
•in exchange for onions. Took up trumpet in high school. Played in 
a lot of combos for dances. Combo had piano, drums, trumpet, sax, 
sometimes a bass or guitar. 4- & 5-piece combos . As a teenager, 
was a fan of big bands . Harry James was his favorite. High school 
t had 14 -piece band , but couldn't play swing. Their band-teacher 
wouldn't let them "jazz it up ." Would buy the music themselves & 
go to other kids' houses to practice swing. Played for high 
school dances . Had lots of opportunity to play , as professional 
musicians had gone to war (WWII ). Remembers making $6 for a 4-hr. 
job. Big money in 1941 . WWII time-frame gave a lot of people 
opportunities they had never had before . Was in combo with 
Stanley Deccio occasionally, maybe a dozen times. Stanley 
Deccio 's had different style. Trumpet doesn't go with accordion. 
Best combo for accordion is clarinet, violin, mandolin , etc., for 
regular Italian music. VC didn't like accordion. Tried a lesson, 
couldn 't do it, so went to clarinet . Old Italians had clarinet, 
f violin, accordion combos . Didn 't like clarinet either, so went to 
trumpet, against professor's advice. Took to it & liked it. 
Played in local Elks ' marching band. Did some symphony work, too. 
Music opened a lot of doors for him. In high school, music did 
for him what sports did for others . Encouraged his kids to take 
lessons, but they didn 't pursue it. 
VC played some Italian music, but he preferred swing & Dixieland. 
Had gone to 1983 New Orleans World 's Fair. Likes New Orleans 
street music . Didn't do much with Italian music, like to hear it, 
but didn't play it much. Has some Italian records. Accordion 
better suited for Italian music . VC & DC were in Italy 
a year 
nt all 
 
'V 
mostly 
e clarinet 
y &rmandolin, softumusicV eAlso eviolas, cellosmpets, 
violins, grand pianos, or piano & accordion combos . Accordion & 
mandolin basic to Italian music. Horace Lazzari came to Walla 
Walla from Canada to 
teach accordion , had lots of kids as 
students , but rock 'n' roll wiped out accordion music. 
r--VC still farms "the old way." Being small. Doesn't want hassle of 
"the new way ," large scale. Tried it, but is semi -retired so does 
it "the old way." Too much stress in "the new way." "If I had 100 
acres of onions sitting out there, I'd have all kind of worries." 
Older more conservative, doesn't want to lose what he has. 
Younger ones have less at stake. VC no longer a gambler, but 
still wants to keep his hands in onions, because he likes to 
watch things grow . Every day is a challenge , but that what keeps 
I you going . "It's intriguing to watch things grow." Always tries 
to improve . Bigger operators do that, too , but don't always know 
what they have all over . VC "as progressive as anybody, when it 
comes to machinery." But doesn 't have latest grading equipment. 
Won't invest in new equipment at his age, has to be able to sell

in a few years. 
Changes in gardening have been gradual, rather than sudden. Most 
sudden change was going from hand-transplanting to direct 
seeding. In days of hand-transplanting, acreage had to be small. 
Started transplanting about October 20, and it might snow by 
November 10, and it was fall-planted onions that made the money. 
They were transplanted to produce two crops from same acreage. 
Would plant in fall, harvest in June or July. In August, planted 
spinach in same ground & harvested that by fall, "working this 
ground hard. Had to be taken care of." Right after spinach, 
onions would be transplanted again. With rising costs of labor, 
hiring Hispanics wasn't worth cost of labor. Also no longer had 
supply of manure and of hauled in peavines. So it became 
economically better to direct seed, and then take on more land to 
raise spinach. Old-timers said not to direct seed, because it 
would need thinning, but coated seed made it possible to make 
proper spacing to raise a nice onion. 
[CONTINUED ON SIDE B] 
Then it became possible to plant up to 100 acres with a precision 
seeder. Even his 5-acres are precision-seeded, "just like the big 
boys, but on a smaller scale." 
Walla Walla lost some processors, McNeill and Libby closed up. 
Built plant in 1932, but closed later. Other processors decided 
to pack spinach in CA. Loss of those processors brought people 
over to asparagus & onions. VC raises only "Walla Walla Sweets." 
Used to raise some winter onions. Will retire soon. Have enjoyed 
farming. Didn't want to be one as a kid, "hated every minute of 
it." Remembers harvesting onions under weeds that were 10 feet 
tall. But changed his mind after the war. Herbicides made work 
much easier. Finally got the challenge in the blood. That 
challenge keeps you going. Never satisfied with a mediocre crop. 
Fellow down the street had a poor onion crop. Couldn't stand to 
get up every morning & look at it. Couldn't wait to harvest it, 
so he didn't have to look at it anymore. VC can never wait to get 
over this year's crop to get to next year's crop. Always raised 
own seed. Everybody's own "Walla Walla Sweet" seed is slightly 
different from their neighbors. Always pulls choices bulbs for 
seed. Picks them up while harvesting. Big operators don't have 
time to "rogue" that while harvesting, but "us old-timers" do. 
"Roguing" is taking out those that are not good. Same as culling. 
Big operators save whole bins for seed. Small operators like VC 
pick out each seed-onion individually. Take out any that are 
less-than-perfect. 
Industry has not been careful enough picking out seed, so quality 
3 
71---/4-toto o,
0L 
has gone down. John Arbini had been picking out an earlier 
strain , called "Arbini strain ." Came up with four different 
strains . He picked them out himself. This extended the season. 
Used to be "Walla Walla Sweet" had a season of two weeks, now 
have a season of 6-8 weeks . "Walla Walla Sweets" should mature 
all at once . Nowadays , with mixed-up seeds, they mature over a 
week, so you get a mixture of mature & immature bulbs. Immatures 
are thrown out by packing shed. The bigger the operation, the 
more chance of quality going down. Today 's kids are damn good 
farmers, but can't get the high yield, but don't need to, because 
working on volume. VC has special customers who want his onions 
to send somewhere . VC's "Walla Walla Sweets" given tender loving 
care. 
"You pick out what your desires are." 
Some want to be first, so 
they pick out a flatter type bulb , because it will mature a few 
days earlier than a globe . Flats tend to crack skin. They are 
hard to run over grader, as they fool the sizer if they go in 
sideways . Don't have as good appearance as globe or as great a 
yield..Clo e• has more onion than flat, but guys who want to be 
_frst, pick outflats, especially early roadside sellers. VC 
prefers globes , even`though a few days later. VC picks for right 
shape, and for early , he picks ones with small necks. For later 
varieties , still picks globes, but picks a wider neck. Size of 
neck decides early , medium, or late. 
Seed onion bulbs usually planted 1st week of September or last 
part of August . They stay in ground all winter. Leaves come 
right away , but umbel or seed-stalk doesn 't come 'tit early May. 
Seed pods are then cut by hand in early August , set out to dry 
for 2 weeks , then "thrashed ," and seed washed, floating out junk 
(seed sinks). In old days, gunny sack filled half full of dried 
seed pods , know tied, then beaten with a baseball bat. Nowadays, 
put in a gunny sack , but run over with the duals of a truck on a 
concrete driveway . That smashes them, then they are "washed" in a 
regular washtub. Seed set out to dry. Seeds settle, chaff and 
junk float. Tips tub so water flows off & seed settles in a 
pocket . 3-4 washings per batch. In old days , if you had too much 
chaff in seeds, you could wind winnow at arm's level. Now have a 
seed-cleaner that does it.

[CHARLIE PAIETTA DOES MOST OF THE TALKING, WITH 
OCCASIONAL 
COMMENTS BY LILLIAN.] 
CP's father, Visento & mother were married in College Place. 
Father came from shore of Lago di Maggiore near Milan. Mother 
came from Naples. In old days, Northern Italians lived in one 
area, Southern Italians, another. Only 2 Tuscan families, and a 
very few Siciliani. Many families came from Lonate Pozzolo near 
Milan. When parents married, after WWI, lived in College Place. 
Parents would take in job-seeking veterans, mother cooked 
minestrone & pasta sucie (?). CP didn't like it then, but does 
now. Also cooked rolenta, a cornmeal mush, poured stew or tomato 
broth over it. Was a main Northern Italian dish. In Po Valley, 
main dish was rice. 
CP still likes rice the best. 
Before mother married, lived in College Place with family of 10. 
Grandfather loved to hear stories of Italy. Had Italian book of 
romances. Just after 1906 San Francisco earthquake, a woman from 
there & taught local kids to read & write Italian. She would read 
to his grandfather, even after she was married. Father was once 
visited by Dr. Angelo Pellegrini, Italian-American English 
professor from the University of Washington. Pellegrini was 
friend of local bank president, who knew CP's dad & brought him 
to meet them. 
First lived on Country Club Rd., walked six miles to town to 
.,F 
shop. Nearby was an Irish family, whose sons came & hung out with 
00 
his mother. Would disappear promptly at 4 p.m. Boys' mother 
objected & when she found out, she lashed them (who were in their 
--S L-A -

A-Q" 
20s!) with a strap . Was afraid people would talk. Mother didn't 
think anything of it . After that they never came back . One bad 
winter, quail would come to eat waste wheat after threshing. 
(Stored vegetables in dirt cellar .) 
So mother rigged a trap with 
an apple box, a stick, and a cord to catch quail . That winter 
lived on quail & potatoes. "Mama saved family." Moved to College 
Place from Country Club Rd. & young Italian men came through 
Walla Walla . Priest, Father Balducci, would send them down to his 
father. Couldn't give them work, but would help them out. 
Some of his relatives were Criscolas . Neighbors were Criscolas. 
Whole Criscola family would party every Sunday , next door to CP's 
childhood home . Always had 5 gallons of chocolate ice cream. CP 
would sneak over to have ice cream, which Paiettas never had. 
Group of 20 in extended family got together . This doesn't happen 
anymore. 
In school, there was prejudice against Italians . In ist grade, CP 
made to sit in corner for 9 months . Told mother years later & she 
cried . Had to stay in 1st grade 2 years. Attributed to prejudice. 
Still a little prejudice now, but a lot then. "Eye-talian" the 
derogatory term. His family didn't suffer as much prejudice 
because his mother spoke English well and father was blue-eyed, 
light-complected . Lampertis & Locatis didn 't know as much 
English. Joe J. Locati first Italian to get an education . Mother' 
21 grandchildren all college-educated, with Ph.D.s or Masters'. 
Proud of how they came up. 
Calabrese were easy-going, worked hard , got more out of life. 
Milanese thrifty, less sociable & more clannish . A Joe Locati 
[not Joe J., but his cousin ] was first Northern Italian to marry 
a Calabrese . This made intermarriage more acceptable. 
CP grew up attending St. Francis of Assisi Church. Alludes to his 
article on his mother 's courtship . Could pick out 50 of the 
people in the 1915 St . Francis Church people. Father [Oscar] 
Balducci was from near Pisa . Was involved in getting Walla Walla 
Italians to invest in San Francisco Bank of Italy before it 
became Bank of America . CP's father mortgaged home to get money 
for shares. He lost money on this, as shares went way down. Paid 
off that mortgage rest of his life . Broke Father Balducci 's heart 
& he died soon after. Present pastor Father Van der Heijden, a 
Dutchman. 
When father came from Italy, had no education . Worked for 
railroad for awhile. Then worked for a local grower , & finally 
got a few acres of his own ground. Son John teaches at Wright 
State Medical College in Ohio . Too much stress in farming. Was 
worse when had no weed -killers or tractors . Today 's young farmers

bright & can make a fairly good living . Father would come home 
late in the evening with the horses , then rub them down, then 
pitch hay , then he'd come in & eat. Always took care of horses 
first . One day father went out to feed horses & didn't come back 
for a long time . Had fallen from hayloft & broken 8 ribs. 
Italians really took care of horses & animals . In Italy, hogs 
taken good care of. Father came from town of Angera (?), would 
herd cows. Picked flowers for his girl friend in meadow. 
aietta ls brother Steven was musical genius . Studied law, but 
worked as a musician. At age 11, worked for Walla Walla radio 
station as accordionist , pianist, & singer . At noon would leave 
St. Vincent School & go play on his own 1/2-hour radio show. Kept 
music up, at age 16, played for dances , then played for Elks. But 
left Walla Walla to seek fortune , went to Portland, OR. to 
perform on radio. Finally went to Hollywood & played in band on 
Art Linkletter's show for 16 years. Later had five orchestras & 
signed a contract to play music for Disney films when he died. 
Had learned music in Walla Walla . Learned piano from nuns at St. 
Vincent 's. Learned accordion from an Italian from Yakima, WA 
named Elmo Letti (?). Steven was brilliant musician . Was once 
called "w'orld! 
s greatest 
-accorcl 
Had tried many 
businesses , but always lost money'. His widow works for ex-Pres. 
Reagan's law firm. She knows Reagan well & has been to his farm. 
Saw Reagan 's horses eat upholstery off his jeep. Reagan tells her 
to call him "Ron ." Goes to Washington , DC. to work on Reagan's 
financial business. Wife 's cousin was one of Reagan's Middle East 
advisors. Predicted Lebanon Marines massacre. Now works in Poland 
& Russia. Son at Wright State just got 1/2-million-dollar grant 
-for genetic research. 
Gives me article he wrote about a visit to Italy in 1940s. Met a 
man, Salvatore Maranda, on shipboard on his way to Tangiers, who 
later turned out to be a major criminal . CP was years later 
questioned by FBI for having known him. Later saw article in 
Argosv magazine about Maranda's criminal career. Died in a French 
prison. In Milan met some Fascists & went to their meetings. 
Their leader , a woman , predicted Italy would be Fascist again by 
1990 . Found them to be scary. Has a cousin, Giancarlo Paietta, in 
Italian Senate, one of leaders of Italian Communist Party. CP 
visited his sister , but never met him. Once in Rome, CP was 
almost refused a place to stay because he was related to 
Giancarlo Paietta . Called him filio da cani (?) 
(son of a dog). 
Italians favor animals in cuss-words, porcio (pig). Call a stupid 
man un papagallo (a parrot). Daughter teaches in New Haven, CT. 
Other daughter lives in Issaquah. CP first saw pizza in New 
Jersey about 40 years ago. 
Father always raised vegetables.

Family worked the farm. Prices were low for lettuce & onions, 
tough to make a living. But everybody was in same boat. Had get 
togethers with wine, no pizza. Italians used "saffron" [actually 
safflower] in rice. Father didn't like tomato sauce. Would eat 
spaghetti with olive oil with garlic fried in it, & cheese added. 
Tomatoes more typically Calabrese. CP has 4 recipes in Walla 
Walla Italian Heritage Cookbook. Some people objected to article 
on hog- butchering & use of blood for pudding. Paiettas pickle 
asparagus. Talks about varieties of "saffron." Europeans use 
milder one than Middle Easterners [which is real saffron]. Local 
grower, Bowers, makes & sells pickled vegetables, including 
asparagus. 
Puts "saffron" in rice. Most people have to grow to like 
"saffron." In old days, always busy. Would go to swamp to get a 
weed called zucchi (?) by Italians. 
Would be cut with a falcet -
(?), a curved knife, dry it in sun for 3 weeks, wrap it in 
bundles for storage. Soaked in water 2 hours before use & used to 
ties bunches of carrots. Was used for many years, before rubber 
bands & twisters. Looked forward, as children, to going to find 
zucchis. Nowadays no longer available, as all swamps have been 
drained. A lot would be picked in swamp where shopping mall [Blue 
Mountain Mall] is now. Would bring lunch, sardines, hardboiled 
eggs & father's favorite vegetable, dandelion greens with vinegar 
& oil. 
Old-timers had a bad diet, too many eggs & too much pork. Father 
died age 59, mother 92. Still can imagine mother out there 
feeding chickens. CP & his brother, Louis, were partners. Bro. 
married a Sicialiano. Paiettas were thought rich because his 
father built one of the first real houses. Others lived in 
ijJ6(t1.%--shacks. Mothers would tell their daughters to try to get Charlie 
or Louis (filii di Visento [?]). Hundreds of marriages after 
WWII. Francis Christiano has a book listing all Italian marriages 
in Walla Walla area. 
Paietta brothers raised spinach, lettuce. Lettuce hard to raise, 
must be ditch-irrigated, ruined by sprinkling. Quit raising 
lettuce when offered 1c a head. Didn't sell it, just mashed it. 
Never raised any more. Then went into spinach for years. In 
recent years, CP & Mrs. Paietta have been raising asparagus 
nursery-stock root to sell to asparagus growers. raised 1,000 
acres worth of nursery stock. Quit it because of danger of 
poisons used in spraying. Now no longer farms. Family has lots of 
love. CP & bro, were once among largest onion-growers in Walla 
Walla Valley, but nothing compared to big growers now. Louis 
Paietta was great singer. Father didn't encourage education, but 
encouraged them to stay home & farm. Louis hated gardening.

Text: [HER NEPHEW , CHARLIE PAIETTA , IS ALSO PRESENT & MAKES 
OCCASIONAL COMMENTS] 
Father came to U.S . in 1905 . Came to find work, because one of 
his Locati cousins sent him passage , but someone else had his job 
when he arrived , so he was out of work . Went to work for local 
Frenchman , Pete Perri , who was from Corsica, one of Walla Walla's 
first farmers. After 2 years sent money for Mother's and CC's 
passage (she was 2). CC came in 1906 . By then bought acreage with 
a partner. 
Perri gave him Corsican onion-seeds. Called "French onions." 
Perri always called "the Frenchman ." Other growers picked out 
first-ripening seeds from these & improved them to have an early 
"French onion." [This was origin of "Walla Walla sweet onion."] 
Then moved to Electric Ave., by Mill Creek [north of College 
> 
Place] . Had small house, shack with flue instead of chimney . > 
Mother was helping father cut asparagus, CC was in bed (age 2 or 
3), dropped sister by creek, yelled for neighbors , neighbor broke 
window & threw out CC with featherbed . "The Frenchman " then put 
them up in his garage . The vegetable- and fruit-shipping houses 
bought lumber & neighbors got together & built them a 4-room 
house. Remembers getting milk from "the Frenchman " (Perri), & he 
had grown children . Remembers how his family were formally 
dressed . One of his sons, in Waitsburg, WA, was electrician, 
another a newspaperman in San Francisco. Some Perris still in 
Waitsburg [ca. 20 mi . NE. of Walla Walla] . Relatives came, one 
after another , to find work in Walla Walla Valley. Land high 
quality . Husband 's side of family, Criscolas, came to N.Y. City 
first. Her late husband, Bill, was born in N.Y. Sister-in-law 
(Charlie Paietta's mother) was born in Walla Walla. 
CC's 
father-in-law stayed a year in Walla Walla, then went back to NY. 
Her sister-in-law (CP's mother) said to be first Italian 
immigrant's child to be born in Walla Walla. Others say that a 
Manuel/Magnoni was first. 
CP: Some local Italians changing their names back to Italian 
form. Prominent artist, Geniso (?) Magnoni [David Manuel Magnoni] 
from Walla Walla changed his name from Manuel back to Magnoni. 
Magnoni has a museum at Wallowa, OR, but lives in CA. 
CC: Magnoni has sculptures in banks. Family rented from Tachis & 
Saturnos/Breens. Breen grandchildren changing names back to 
Saturno. Her family (Locatis) then bought a plot of Blalock 
Orchard property from Dr. Nelson G. Blalock. Took out trees with 
horses. Property had artesian well. Shopping-mall--[Blue Mountain 
Mall] now using that water for sprinklers.-Blalock Orchard good 
property because of artesian wells. Everybody hadgown - days & ---
hours to water. 
In early days crops diversified. All work done by hand. Small 
holdings. Raised asparagus, rhubarb, "bunch stuff": carrots, 
radishes; cabbage. Did well with carrot until cannery relocated. 
Nowadays only onions, spinach & asparagus. If you didn't make it 
on one crop, you did on another. There were no local telephones, 
& shipping houses got orders, father had to wait at shipping 
house until order came. Then he went home by horse & wagon & put 
up the order. Usually had one hired man then. This took lots of 
time. Putting up the order then became first priority for 
everyone in family. 
Locatis were in Walla Walla Gardeners' Association (WWGA), father 
was, but her husband, Bill Criscola, wasn't. Used other shipping 
houses. WWGA was "a wonderful thing for the growers." WWGA had a 
store which the members could charge staple goods against crop. 
WWGA's store sold rice (by 100-1b. sack), flour, canned goods, 
oil, & salami. Paid for it when produce sold to WWGA. This really 
helped growers. "Got by with what they had." 
CP: 
[In his work with St. Vincent's charities] never has had any 
Italian-Americans ask for help in 20 years. Next generation 
different though. Get $387 per child from welfare, gets food & 
clothes free [from St. Vincent's]. 
CC: Walked to school from Myra Rd. Had chillblains from cold 
during walk. People gave them rides in buggies or wagons. 
Remembers Mr. Tachi killed by runaway horses.

[Blue Mountain Mall] is today. That place frightened CP. Tachi's 
widow had a Greek lover who used up all the family fortune. 
CC: Mrs. Tachi was Locatis' landlady. 
Had lots of property in 
Walla Walla area. She was illiterate. The Greek, her niece's 
husband, her niece died, and he ended up taking care of her 
business. When she died, wasn't a cent left, despite all of her 
scrimping & saving. Mrs. Tachi gave them peaches that had fallen 
off the tree. She sold fruit. Mrs. Tachi got up on ladder to pick 
cherries, even as a very old woman. 
CP: Mrs. Tachi proud, stubborn, uncharitable. 
CC: Mrs. Tachi came to CC's house one Christmas morning, when CC 
was a little girl, & brought her a doll. Was taught to respect 
her. 
CP: Remembers when his mother, as a little girl, wouldn't dance 
with Tachi, so she was tied to the table for six hours for 
disrespect. Tachi didn't mind it either. "He said that she should 
have more respect for older people." 
CC: Once when Tachi startled Bill Criscola's dog & the dog bit 
him, they had to kill the dog. 
CP: Remembers old man Tachi was so tight, his workers had no food 
in winter. They would sometimes steal potatoes from hogs & eat. 
Still have iron kettle. 
CC: They were happy, didn't know any better. Christmas got only 
some oranges, nuts & doll, brothers got little toy truck. Now 
they get everything & they're not happy. Grandchildren have 20 
teddy bears. 
Christmas Eve put out little baskets & they were filled with nuts 
& oranges & occasionally a little toy & candy. Always walked to 
church Christmas Eve. Had dinner, uncle's family came to family 
gathering. Used to get milk from neighbor, Raimondos (?). Sister 
& CC would fight over who went for milk Christmas morning because 
they had more & always gave a treat. Raimondos had marshmallow & 
coconut cookies. Doesn't make Italian Christmas cookies due to 
arthritis. Used to make them. Southern Italians make more 
Christmas cookies than Northern Italians. 
CP: Southern women bake a lot. 
CC: Mother made Christmas bread, Danetone. 
CP: Mrs. Lamperti & Mrs. Daltoso came later. Paiettas came in 
19th century.

CC: Went back to Italy in 1952 with mother. Italy hadn't changed 
much then. Went to hometown of Galerati & it was the same. Also 
went back in 1971 , after husband died, for cousin's wedding & 
Galerati had changed totally . Now Italians owned their own homes, 
quite modern . Her son went there last year. 
CP: 
[In Italian ], "The women from Italy are the most beautiful in 
the world." Roman relative said Neapolitan women most beautiful. 
CC: CC started growing irises 20 years ago . About 15 years ago, 
started growing iris bulbs commercially . Met many growers all 
over the U.S. Has cut back on iris -growing because of age. Went 
to growers' convention in Oklahoma City & Memphis, TN. Have 
enjoyed it. Flower-growers wonderful people . Austin Morgan of 
College Place grows about 8-10 acres of them. She sold most of 
her stock to him 2 years ago. Kept some, though , just enough for 
her to take care of. 
Has sold some to Belgium, Canada, & Italy. 
Has had request from East Germany. East German's parents had had 
nursery, but couldn't improve it. Asked for some irises, but he 
couldn't receive them . Girls in iris club wanted to help send 
them . He contacted her through her ads in American Iris Society's 
newsletter . Enjoys flowers more than anything else. Has helped 
her because of wonderful letters . [CP leaves.] 
[CONTINUED ON SIDE B] 
In Northern Italy, they raised silkworms, but men had to go to 
Switzerland or France to look for work. CC's father went to 
Switzerland to work in rice-fields . Also helped build Alps 
tunnels . Also took care of horses for landlord . To find steady 
work, had to come to U.S. or South America. Father's brother & 
sister went to South America . Her father was a fine worker, a 
perfectionist, a good farmer. Her son, Virgil Criscola, also a 
perfectionist . One has to like watching things grow . She always 
wanted to marry a farmer. Likes to work with Virgil & help him. 
Dreads not being able to get up and dig in the dirt. Just turned 
85, so time to give it up because of bad shoulder.

MD is from Cazale di Scodozia (?), near Padua, Veneto, Italy. 
Came to U.S. 
Was 19 when she came to U.S. Her husband had come 
to Walla Walla in 1921, came back to Italy in 1928, married her, 
and brought her back to U.S. in 1929. Mr. Daltoso was an onion-
grower. Went back to Italy with four children in 1948, and came 
back to U.S. in 1949. 
Spent many years working in the onions, pulling weeds, 
transplanting seed onions before winter, thinning. In fall used 
to plant transplant onions, one-by-one, in rows. Would cut 
spinach, pull carrots, cut lettuce & cabbage, bunch radishes, 
raised rhubarb. Used to sing while working, especially when 
topping onions, which was hard work. No-one wanted to do it, but 
early in morning & late in afternoon, kids would help if she told 
stories or sang. They would sing with her. Remembers one 
Thanksgiving Day they were planting onions. Didn't want to, but 
had to because winter was on its way. So she put turkey in oven, 
went out & planted onions all day & had Thanksgiving dinner in 
evening. 
Mr. Daltoso was from same time. Was 13 years older than she. 
Served as a water boy in WWI. During war, his family moved to 
Lombardy, near Milan. That was where Daltoso family had been 
from, but he had been born in Cazale di Scodoza (?), Veneto.

In U.S., they cooked spaghetti, risotto, polenta and stew, beans, 
catsola (?) 
(cabbage stew cooked with pork skin, bones & meat, 
with wine added). Still likes to make that. Some kids like it, 
some don't. Made meatballs, chicken. Raised her own chicken & 
pigs. Made own salami. Would butcher 60-70 young chickens at a 
time & freeze in freezer. Made own bacon & ham. 
hey celebrated Christmas both Eve (Vigil) & Day. Went to church, 
had Christmas tree. Went to Midnight Mass, Came home 1 a.m. & had 
fried salami & "all kinds of goodies." Didn't go to bed until 
3:30-4 a.m. 
Christmas Day had big meal about 1 p.m. Waited 'til 
after midnight to have feast so they could eat fried salami. 
Earlier Christmas Eve (Vigil) ate tuna and bacala (?) 
(dried 
cod). Still goes to midnight mass on Christmas Eve. They still 
open presents in evening. Hard to find bacala in Walla Walla. 
Once got some from Seattle. Wanted to bring some home from Italy, 
but after wrapping it to cover smell, it didn't fit in suitcase. 
Can't bring meat through Customs. Still loves bacala. 
Now can eat meat on Fridays. Ash Wednesday, even today, no meat, 
also Holy Friday (Good Friday). Avoids meat on Fridays during 
Lent. 
Easter she made best ravioli. Lot of people ate risotto, pasta. 
Always the best kind made. Ate cakes called torta margarita. Is a 
very soft cake made with only yolk. Try to make different foods 
for Easter. Grandchildren color eggs & get candy. 
Daughter celebrates Christmas the traditional Italian way, 
because her children (MD's grandchildren) like it that way. 
Christmas morning they sleep in. Kids like fried salami, open a 
few presents & go to bed, in the morning they open the 
restaurant. 
Daltosos belonged to Walla Walla Gardeners' Association (WWGA). 
Left his share to his son. Eight acres were enough for Daltosos 
do "pretty good." Nowadays her son [Bennie Daltoso] is partners 
with Frank Magnaghi, grow a lot of onions. Still pays land rent 
to MD. This year put in wheat to strengthen soil, no longer get 
peavine & manure to put in ground. Soils weakened by chemicals. 
Last year they fumigated the ground for "white rot," fungus 
disease. Paid $4,000 and onions still got the disease. This year 
put in wheat. 
Wrote down the stories & songs from memory to help her remember 
when I came. A few years ago she had a better voice. Now it 
cracks.
