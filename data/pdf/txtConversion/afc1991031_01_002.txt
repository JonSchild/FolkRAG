T.The Region and White Settlement 
Middle Park--Explored and recorded first by a party from 
Illinois in 1839. Fremont expedition (official 
exploration)--1844. Berthoud Pass discovered as a 
"practicable route" into the Park ca. 1860. 
■' i 
Indian agent for Middle Park for negotiations with 
Ute Indians ca. 1862. Blue River Pioneer Exploring 
Co. —1865. 
Summit County—Established 1861. County seat: Breckenridge 
Named for mountainous character of the territory. The 
eastern boundary of the original county followed 
"the summit of the snowy range" from a point a little 
south of Breckenridge to the Wyoming line. One of 
the original 17 territorial counties and embracing 
a vast area. Portions were used to create other 
counties and its area is now 604 sq. miles (Eichler) 
Breckenridge (Summit County) 
Indigenous name—"Nah-oon-kara" (Ute). Located 
in eastern crook of Continental Divide. Region 
watered by Blue,River, headwaters of Arkansas River 
and South Platte River. Ten Mile Range parallels 
the Continental Divide west of Breckenridge—the 
peaks are numbered to denote the miles travelled 
from Brectenridge to Frisco in the "old days" [L^-Baw] . 
Founded by a party of prospectors under Gen. 
George E. Spencer. Grew to service the mining communities 
that developed after 1859, a trading center.

Founded December, 1859. A fort was built 1 mile 
north of the present site of Breckenridge—Fort 
Mary Bigelow, named for the first woman quartered 
there. 
Town of Breckinridge named in honor of John 
Cabal Breckinridge, Vice President under President 
James Buchanan. Intended as a flattering gesture to 
prompt Congress to create a post office at the 
new settlement, effort met with success. Because 
of John Breckinridge's later sympathy with the 
Confederacy, the ardent Unionists of the city petitioned 
Congress to change the spelling of the name of the 
town to '*Breckenridge" . 
Breckenridge mentioned in The Rocky Mountain Herald 
for June 16, 1860. By 1861--population= approx. 5,000. 
Established as the oaunty seat, 1862. 
Mining attention in Breckenridge primarily focused 
on gold. Three mining booms: 
(1) placer gold (ca. 1863) 
(2) lode gold (ca. 1878) 
(3) dredge gold (ca. 1897) [LeiBawl 
By spring of 1865—a general store was operating 
in Breckenridge, proprietors: Tabor and Weber 
(H.A.W. Tabor, later of Leadville and Denver fame). 
Sample prices: 
flour—$42/barrel 
butter--$2.50/lb. 
eggs--$2.50/dozen 
Newspaper, Summit County Journal established 1879.

Railroad (Denver, South Park & Pacific) reacked 
Breckenridge) 1882. 
Description of Breckenridge printed in Grofutt's 
Grip-Sack Guide of Colorado (1882) reads, in part, as 
follows: 
Breckenridge—County seat of Summit 
county, received a town organization in. May, 
1880, and in the census taken soom after 
gave a population of 1,628, which, at the 
close of the year, had nearly doubled;and is 
is still rapidly increasing. It is situated 
on the Blue River, on the western slope 
of the "Snowy Range" eighteen miles southeast 
from Como, and 106 miles south of west from 
Denver. Principal business, placers and 
quartz mining. There are three smelting 
works and one stamp mill in the city, and 
others building. Breckenridge has three 
newspapers—the Journal, daily and weekly, 
and the Leader, a weekly. The Grand Central, 
and the Denver are the two leading hotels 
out of a dozen. Six churches or church 
organizations, seven public schools, an opera 
house and theatre, telegraph and telephone. 
Two banks, stores, restaurants, saloons, and 
shops of all kinds, together with private resi¬ 
dences, comprise the town. Two railroads are 
now building to reach the business of the region 
CO80-BO-BR 
-4- 
The Denver & Rio Grande from Leadville,via 
Kokomo, and the South Park from Como, via 
Breckenridge Pass. It is expected both of 
these roads will reach the town about the 
the same time, or by July 1st, 1881. 
According to the census of Breckenridge, 
when taken, there were only four persons 
out of employment, twelve that could not 
read and write, and only nine disabled by 
disease. Twenty-five per cent were of 
foreign birth, and the balance Americans. 
Lode mines are counted by thousands in the 
vicinity, and large numbers of mines are 
producing gook milling and smelting ores— 
the number, too numerous to mention. The 
greater portion of the ores are gold, but 
many carry silver, lead, and copper... 
.. Breckenridge is surrounded by great numbers 
of small mining camps of from fifty to 300 
miners, that purchase all their supplies 
and spend most of their money at the county 
seat, which add materially to the business 
prosperity of the city. Game, such as deer, 
elk, bear and grouse, are abundant near the 
city; also, trout. 
From Breckenridge to Lincoln City is 
four miles; to Swan, eight miles; to Preston^ 
three miles; Alma, seventeen miles; Frisco, 
ten miles; Georgetown, forty miles; Conger, 
three miles; Chloride, four miles; and Kokomo,

to "Breckenridge, i+s Early History and 
Present Resources," soon to be published 
by the proprietors of the Summit County 
Leader. Price fifty cents. Fares: seventeen 
miles from Como, by stage, $2.50; from 
Denver, via South Park Division, Union 
Pacific Railway, eighty-eight miles by 
rail, fare $7.35... ^p.79] 
By some accounts (LeBaw), through a legal oversite 
a 1300 sq. mile area including Breckenridge was never 
admitted to the Union. This mistake was corrected on 17 
August, 1936. The town celbrates "No Man's Land Day"-- 
holding their right to be a "free and independent kingdom 
for 3 days each year"--a holiday recently incorporated with 
the spring ski festival: Ullr Dag. 
Frisco (Summit County) Named for San Francisco, CA. 
The first settler was H.A. Recen, who arrived in 1873. ^Eic 
Grand County Estabished 1874. County seat: Hot Sulphur 
Springs. Nmaned for Grand Lake and Grand River (later 
renamed the Colorado R^jLver) County formed from a portion 
of Summit County. Area = 1,854 sq. miles [Eichler] 
Population and settlement: first few decades-- 
largely male society. Most women of marriageable age 
living there in 2880's were legitimately married. 
Relatively high rate of divorce (11 between 1879-1886). 
By 1890, population 20% female, by 1900t-25% female. 
C080-BO-BR

Predominantly white society. Non Anglo/American 
settlers--many of Germanic origins (names like Lehmans, 
Linke), German-speaking Swiss (especially in Kremmling) 
and Austrians. Rapid assimilation, no "ethnic communities"^1 
Central City land office established to parcel out 
land—maximum of 320 acres (160 by pre-emption, 160 by 
homestead) available at low cost. Mountains determined the 
shape of properties. 
Local county politics important--often factional and 
divisive. 
Grand County's first newspaper —North Park Miner (1881) 
Mining boom (rush) 1882; decline—post-1885. 
Development of ranching (sheep, cattle) and crops 
to support livestock. Irrigation. 
Moffat railroad (ran through Kremmling) in order 
to connect Denver with the Yampa Valley, provided stimulus 
to towns of Kremmling, and Hot Sulphur Springs. 
Grand County News—established 1903. Telephone and 
telegraph arrived ca. 1906. Population rose in early 
1900's—Swedish, Germans, Canadians,,some Greek, 1 Negro, 
no American Indians. 
Beginnings of organized conservation (forest reserves)— 
Rocky Mountain National Park, occupying part of Grand 
County, est'd. between 1912-1915. 
Automobiles arrived in the second decade of 1900's and, 
with them, the development and improvement of roads. 
Pre-World War I prosperity (ranching vigor) In 1912, 
Kremmling became the site of the popular Grand County Fair, 
featuring "greenlorse races" and "bucking contests". 
CO80-B0-BR

Prohibition by state amendment (1916)—defiance and 
evasion in Middle Park. Forest provided concealment for 
distilling (e.g. Sam Stone—local ranching personality- 
smuggled liquor to Hot Sulphur Springs) ^Black] 
Increase in cultural activities, school functions, in 
second decade of 20th century. Grand County Pioneer Society (1919 
Still little organized religion. 
1920's—Middle Park didn't share in the general 
national prosperity; Great Depression hit the region ca. 1920, 
not 1929. Collapse of prices—repurcussions throughout 
debt structure. 
Moffat Tunneh begun ca. 1923. Water piped to Denver. 
1930-31—State Highway Dept, kept Berthoud Pass&pen 
during winter—year-roamd auto traffic through region 
for the first time. 
1950's--Colorado-Big Thompson irrigation and power 
project. 
Hot Sulphur Springs (Grand County) Named for hot springs 
in the area. Townsite once owned by William N. Byers, 
founder of the Denver Rocky Mountain News. 
Grand Lake Largest natural body of water in Colorado. 
Kremmlinq (Grand County) Named for immigrant, Rudolph 
Kremmling, a retail merchant who came to the tovmsite from 
Dillon in 1884. Kremmling had been born in Germany, had 
come to the U.S. in order to avoid military conscription, 
C080-BO-BR 
-8- 
and settled first in New Jersey. After a military stint 
during the Civil War he moved to Iowa in 1879, to Denver 
in 1881 and to Dillon in 1883. His Grand County interests 
were always subsidiary—post office under his name. 
The site of Kremmling was an obvious transport meeting 
point with fine bottom meadows. A ferry ran across the 
Grand River. First "stores" opened by Aaron Kinsey and K 
Tracy Tyler. Became a trade center for ranchers. 
Among its early churches were "community church". 
Episcopal Church, and Roman Catholic Church, but religion 
generally lagged. [Black] 
II. Indian settlement 
Utes native to Blue River area. Favored hunting area. 
Indians (general)--effects of Spanish importation of horse: 
1) locomotion—mobility 
2) transportation—burden carriers, tribes able to 
follow migrating game 
3) warfare—circling charge 
4) food getting—move from primitive agriculture 
(squash, beans, maize) to pursuit of buffalo. 
Travelled inMnall bands. 
Skirmishes between whites and Indians over horseflesh 
Disease ("Evil Spirit") brought by whites 
Population shipfts and pressures lead to wars among Indians 
and between Indian pnd whites^ 
Utes--little tribal organization 
Ouray—Ute choice for supreme chiefl to negotioate with 
CO80-B0-BR 
-9- 
whites. 
Indian agencies—first Indian agent, Kit Carson, 
warned of Ute discontent (1859); Otto Mears, Indian agent. 
Agencies maintained herds offcattle for the Indians' use. 
Tensions between whites and Indians escalated with repeated 
rumors of massacre (especially 1864-1867) ^Lavender] 
III. Mining 
1851—Solti—first-“discovered" in Colorado by prospectors 
led"^by^Sree^Rnsse^l. Concentration on gold mining in 
Breckenridge. 
Silver collapse—1893. Labor disturbances among 
miners in Cripple Creek —wake of crash, siisistence wages 
($3/day, cost of living high, e.g. shack $15/month, 
water 5c/bucket, cord on wood $4.50) and labor glut. 
Wages uniform but not hours. Discontent. Strike. Violence 
(May 1894). Repurcussions throughout Colo. Breckenridge, 
because of its concentration on gold mining fared better 
than most mining towns in the face of the silver crash. 
Mining proceeded sd^SSa^y, punctuated by booms, e.g. 
initial boom subsided as placer gold was depleted, gold 
that remained were deposited in combination with other 
minerals—insufficient technology and capital to proceed 
with deep mining. ^Lavender) 
Mining camp life (Colo., general) 
Population, early days--ratio men: women:: 30:1 
Those women in the area usually settled there legitimately 
with a husband. 
CO80-BO-BR 
-10- 
Quarters: Initially lodged in overcrowded hotel 
rooms, partitions improvised from bed sheets fire-proofed 
with alum. Straw mattresses and pillows. Community towel 
and community comb. Settlement--tents, evergreen lean-tos 
or cavities in hillsides. Next, log cabins--sawdust floor 
and gunny sack carpet, furnishings: usually a hand-hewn 
table, chair with woven rawhide seat, 3-legged stools, 
shelf, bed fastened to wall (required only one leg), 
hay mattress, tin dishes, iron pots used over fireplace 
(few stoves). Sometimes newspaper wallpaper. ^Lavender-2] 
Diets Game (peddled by local hunters), oxen, salt pork 
bacon, beans, potatoes (cooked in fireplace), bread (baked 
in fireplace in a fruing pan set edgewise to the blaze), 
coffee. Dried fruit as a luxury. Taffy pulls (social event) 
"Lemonade" (citric acid powder to disguise the flavor of 
the water) hawked in the streets. ^Lavender-l^ 
Description printed in GrofuttTs Grip-Sabk Guide of Colorado 
The cooking in most towns and cities in the 
mountains, belond the lines of railways, is 
most infernal. The supply of meats, such as 
beef, mutton, elk, deer, bear, etc., is abundant, 
also trout and feathered game; yet everything is 
cooked in grease--fairly wallowed in grease. The 
cooks do not appear to know anything about broiling, 
or boiling, or how to bake a trout. When we first 
encountered this mode of cooking until our return— 
three months--it seemed as though the same piece 
of meat left at the first meal, and the same cook, 
had kept just a little ahead of us for the whole time. 
...They will take the finest brook trout, put it in 
a pan of grease that it could swim in, and fry 
until the delicate flavor of the fish is completely 
absorbed in grease... ' {jp.182] 
Sanitation and Public Services: Atmosphere of 
public thoughtlessness--attention expended on mining 
C080-BO-BR 
-11- 
enterprises, little left over for public administration, 
e.g. no maintenance of public roads. Water difficult and 
expensive to obtain--little washing. Filth and garbage 
accumulated. Rats and mice abounded. 
Health: Respiratory diseases common—poorly ventilated 
buildings, chilly, habit of spitting in publicindoors and 
and out--in proximity to where people would bed down. 
"Mountain sickness"—a form of typhoid or undulant fever, 
disappeared ca. 1880. Symptoms: foul-tasting mouth, 
lassitude, constipation, headache, chills and high fever; 
fataiities-2%; treatment: boil sagebrush in large kettle 
until a thick syrup--add whiskey, dose frequently. ^Lavender 1&2^ 
Morale: Early camps relatively decorous. Predominancy 
male society. Inconvenient and inaccessible for parasite 
types. Concentration on business venture—seen as temporary, 
get-rich interlude. Debating, literary and glee societies. 
Illumination poor and not much to read. Non-professional 
dances (Breckenridge's Rev. Dyer often vexed by miners' 
acrting church harmonium off for a dance) Evening visiting, 
singing with fiddle, flute, or jew's harp. Later— "hurdy-gurdy 
girls" or "dance hall girls"—usually sold dances (50C-$1 per 
dance), often half of her earnings went to the house. 
Dance orchestra: 1-3 fiddles. 
For women in mining camps—isolation, spiritual and 
physical hardship ("cabin fever" struck them especially 
hard) 
Religion: itinerant missionaries, e.g. Rev. John L. Dyer- 
spread the gospel and carried mail.

Law—people's court 
^Lavender-2) 
IV. Ranching (general) 
Longhorn cattle= Andalusian cattle, arrived with 
Spanish colonists. Bred ralidly in S. Texas. Also 
cultural remnants of Iberian tradition, e.g. practice 
of branding as legal evidence of livestock ownership: 
attitude toward fencing: under English law. the cattle 
owner is expected to fence his cattle in, under Spanish law, 
the property owner is expected to fence others' cattle out: 
ranching vocabulary: "bronco"— rough, cratpbed*, "sombrero"-- 
"sombra", shade; "remuda"--change, replacement. 
Cattle drives north from Texas—Uncle Dick Wooton, 
1840's, commercial venture. 
American pioneers brought cattle across continent, 
mountaineers accumulated the stock pioneers abandoned in 
the Rockies, allowed them to winter on their own, feeding 
on native grasses. Despite this practice among trappers, 
tradition attributes the introduction of the livestock 
industry to a freighter, "Colonel" Jack Henderson, who 
in 1858 turned his cattle loose in the vicinity of Cherry 
Creek because he couldn't feed them through.-, the winter, 
only to recover them in spring, still hale d hearty. 
Succession of large-scale ranchers: e.g. John Illiff, 
a Scotch Methodist who, arriving in Colo, at age 28, purchased 
discarded cattle from cross country emigrants and in 
quantity from Texas rancher, Charle Goodnight, and sold 
at great profit. Eventually upgraded his stock, accumulated 
land in vicinity of Greeley, ran a highly profitable business. 
Also Oliver Loving--rancher around Pueblo. 
CO80-BO-BR 
-13- 
After the Civil War, Texas ranchers were poverty- 
stricken, partly on account of transportation tie-ups— 
drove their cattle north in direction of railroad lines 
and markets. Supplied Colo. Yet, Texas longhorns had 
deficiencies—not tasty, tough hides, and disease carriers 
(carried ticks which spread "tick fever" or "Texas fever" 
to which they were immune). There rose an effor to halt 
importation of longhorns into Colo, (legislative edict- 
1867) When this failed to take effect, longhorns 
forced to winter out of the area, as winter weather killed 
tne diseased ticks. Ta0ff&McCaffre^ Meanwhile, ranchers 
such as Sam Hartsel attempting to breed self-sufficiently, 
by importing cattle from the East. 
Throughout 1860's and '70's stockgrowers began to 
realize the possibilities represented by a growing Eastern 
market stimulated by post-civil War industrial growth. 
Moreover, the coming of the union Pacific, the Kansas 
Pacific and the Santa Fe railroads made speedy transportation 
possible, while the development of refrigeration ih 
the Chicago meat-packing industry opened up European markets, 
increasing the demand for western meat. 
Eventually, competition for land and stock rose. 
Rustlers became a problem (Goff & McCaffree contend that 
the term "rustler" came into vogue ca. 1898, a prduct of 
tthe dime novel era; "to rustle"-common expression for 
person or cow that's energetic or active). Cattlemen 
banded together for mutual protection, forming the ' 
C-txAssociation) (1867f). Association hired 
C080-BO-BB 
-14- 
private detectives, registered brands, appointed brand 
inspectors to check for alteration of brands at major 
shipping points (inspectors clipped the amimal1^ hfe& 
to see it's hide or sometimes had it killed to inspect the 
underside of the hide, where recent burns sere more apparent, ^ 
ae$i established round-up districts aid appointed round-up 
foremen. Association developed considerable political 
power—passed through legislation on quarantines, bounties 
for predatory animals, rewards for locoweed (until it was 
discovered that farmers were raising it expressly for the 
purpose of turning it in) made the railroads responsible 
for any livestock they killed (prompting the railroads 
to fence along their rights-of-way). 
Gradually, Eastern and foreign capital entered the 
industry--often subjected to swindles and inefficient 
management. 
Meanwhile, Colorado stock upgraded by import^ion of 
stock, e.g. Galloways, Devons, Ayershires—some unsuited 
to the climate and altitude. 
1870's--decade of the "cattle baron"; 1880's-- 
decade of cattle companies forming ^Goff & McCaffree~\ 
During the 1880's—ranching boom. Increasing competition 
for land. Water was key. "By controlling a choice stream 
site, a man also controlled the grazing land as far back 
as a cow could walk" £ Lavender-1~~] Legal claim= 160 acres 
(homestead allotment), so large-scale ranchers took out 
land in names of relatives, hire hands, etc. Also 
by purchase—technique was to surround someone until they 
were forced to sell. (E.g. John Iliff owned 15,000 acres 
C080-BO-BR 
-15- 
along the S. Platte--controlled forty times that much) 
Used barbed wire to fence off -enormous tracts of public 
domain—unauthorized. 
By 1886—boom collapsed. Drought and Blizzard. 
Alterations in industry—turn to raising hay for winter feed, 
use reserve pastures, breed with Herefords (more meat 
per animal)» 
Ongoing competition for land--agriculturalists fencing 
off portions, scoring the land with ditches; competition 
from sheep ranchers (late 1870*s) raising wool. Sheep— 
clip grass too close, trample roots with razor-sharp 
hooves; because in constant need of protection, travel 
in concentrated packs, destroying the range for cattle. 
By 1886--2 million sheep in Colo. Competition for land 
produced conflict, some vie! ence--f actional combinations 
among large ranchers, small ranchers, sheep ranchers, 
rustlers=strange bedfellows. 
Combined factors spelt doom of range ranching. By 
1891 Forest Service stepped in to halt controversy over 
use of public domain (range). Created reserves—no trespass 
by animals. 
1934—Taylor Grazing Act. Curtailed use of public 
lands and practice of homesteading. 
Ranch life (general). First ranch dwellings were 
dugouts roofed with earth, doors made of hides stretched 
on pole frames. Gradually log cabins or shanties of raw 
lumber were erected. Barns, toosheds, smithies and corrals. 
COOU-BO-bR 
-16- 
Ranch work—injury expected daily—falling horse, charging 
cow, etc. Illnesses: treated with castorix, castor oil, 
mustard plaster, turpentine (favorite antiseptic), a 
poultice of tobacco quids for snakebites, matted cobwebs for 
stopping bleeding. \Lavender-l; Sprague~\ 
Water and Agricultural Life (general). Irrigation. 
Mormons employed irrigation extensively (cooperative 
irrigation) both in Utah and in other area they colonized. 
Railroads encouraged agricultural settlement (to 
help pay the cost of extending lines, railroad corporations 
became land developers) 1880's--Thousands of Russian 
and German immigrants arrived. Also whole communities 
resettled--e.g. cooperative venture: Greeley. 
Sandy uplands more fertile than bottoms. 
Employed canals and reservoirs to lead water to soil. 
Federal aid to projects such as dams (Bureau of Reclamation) 
Conception of property rights—water rights— "prior 
beneficial use"=whoever puts water to good use first has 
claim to it. 
V. Ranching and Agriculture—Middle Park and Grand County 
Ranches developed ca. 1860's—small; legal 320 acres 
didn't provide sufficient return. 
Bills proposed to increase allowable acreage: e.g. 
as bounty for planting timber (Timber Culture Act, 1873) or 
for irrigating (Desert Land Act, 1877). 
Because ranches small, droveAcattle ^to piai&s (over 
Rollins Pass) for summer grazing. Practice of cattle 
driving died out with the development of an adequate 
hay supply. 
C080-BO-BR 
-17- 
Considerable use (infringement) of public domain—control 
ling winter meadows for winter feed. (Public domain also 
of interest for its minerals.) 
Ranching boom ca. 1880. Large scale enterprises: 
Iliffs, "Col." Alfred Arghalier ("May-be-so Ranch"), 
Thomas Webb Preston—irrigated, kept 3,000 sheep by 1885, 
Hilary Harris and Co. (Day Ranch)--over 2,000 sheep. 
1875—first registered brand, by 1884—176 registered brands. 
Thomas E. Pharo—first secretary of Middle Park Stockguwers' 
Association; Pharo also ranched and cultivated vegetables and 
grain on the Lower Blue River—his dwelling, complete with 
post office, named Colorow. 
Acceleration of mining in region led to acceleration 
of ranching to supply miners with meat. 1870's--primarily 
extractive economy; 1880's—primarily cultivating economy. 
George Henry Church introduced Hereford breed to Grand 
County. Coberly introduced 100 head Iowa cattle 1882. 
Georgetown—group of promoters proposed engrossment 
of entire western half of Middle Park for corporate livestock 
empire, advertising a profit rate of 45% in first year (1884) 
Winter 1889—severe livestock losses. Encouraged 
cultivation of hay for winter feed, employment of irrigation 
techniques and more administrative control in ranching 
industry. 
1890's—economic stagnation; ranching—subsistence 
living, but more settled than the suffering mining industry. 
Little tenantry or emcumbrance by mortgage, number of 
deeded acres reached 200,000 by 1900—western districts 
most sought after. 
CO80-BO-BR 
-18- 
1898-99—terrible winter, animals couldn't reach 
hay, severe losses. Nevertheless, by 1900, ranching was 
dominant economic force in the county; one-sixth of total 
investment was in livestock, mostly owner-operated businesses. 
Several settlers of German origin—quickly assimilated into 
American ranching community by virtue of common ranching 
methods. Small scale operations—usually proprietor, his 
family and 1 or 2 hired hands. Out-trailing of cattle 
in autumnn--often small return on investment. Pole (not 
wire) fences. [Black, p.257-8] 
- Water diversion to eastern slope, competition with 
places like Boulder City for water. Serious regulation 
and administration of water rights ca. 1906. 
Hay=key crop. 200 tons/100 acres constituted superior 
production. 
Transportation improvements—cattle shipped from 
trackside pens causing less deterioration of the meat 
before it reached the Denver market as opposed to former 
practice of driving cattle. Meat brought $6-$7.10/100 weight 
ca. October of 1913. Last attempt to "trail" cattle—1923. 
No profit. 
First 2 decades of 20th century was "Golden Age" of 
ranching [.Black-; p. 329) 
Modernization: availability of gas, ranchhouse interiors 
"hissed with the brilliance of mantle lamps" [Black, p.327] 
Yet in business fundamentals, little change ("The internal 
combustion engine had not yet invaded the hay meadow"— 
ensrgy expended by man and beast--Black, p. 327) Ca. 1920 
CO80-BO-BR 
-19- 
still a pole fence landscape. 
Expansion of number and size of ranch units between 
1900-1920. New ditches (and litigation). Continued 
cultivation of "small grains" (oats, wheat, barley); 
some commercial dair^’> enterprises (e.g. Kremmling Cheese 
and Butter Co.) 
WuA 
Importance of annual hay sale tof. economy demonstrated 
dominance of ranching industry in the area. 
Comparative absence of bad feeling between cattlemen 
and sheepmen. One instance of controversy in Ten Mile Valley— 
Fritz and Sophie Linke (sheepraisers) vs. Josef Rohrac’ner. 
Kremmling--ranch center. 
During slump years of 1920's, the number of ranches and 
farms remained stable, but the size of the units increased 
and there was a decline in estimated Value 1920-1925. 
During these years—44% of all units were encumbered by 
mortgage, attachment or foreclosure. General stagnation. 
Ranchers driven to discover alternative to beef, which was 
not marketable—turned to dairying, sheep. (e.g. Hinman 
Bros, and Jone Cattle Co. turned to sheep). Also, increase 
in truck farming (lettuce). 
"Throughout the twenties the earlier Grand County— 
its pole fences and privies, its eaves dripping ice water
