Toast the army and navy who fought for our cause, 
Who conquered and wen us our freedom and laws. 
WHAT ARE YOU CRYIN' 
FOR, 
NELLY ? 
A 
comic duet, by FRND MAY, received nightly with thunders of ap-
plause. 
MOTHER.—Now what are you cr' yin' for, Nelly? 
Don't be blubbering there like a 
fool, 
With the weight of your grief, sure I 
tell you, 
You'll break down the three-legged stool. 
I 
know now your crying for Barney, 
But, don't b'lleve a 
word that he'd say, 
He tells nothing but big lies and blarney, 
Sure you know bow he humbugged Kate Kearney.

NELLY.-011, mother—

NELLY.—Arrah°, mother, he's going away. 
Oh, mother, he's going away. 
Oh, mother, he's go-

Sure I 
dreamt t'other night of his ghost draped in 
white. 
Oh, mother, he's going away. •

liontEn.—On then, if he's going much the bettor, 
Blessed hour when he's out of my sight. 
He'sn plague and a 
scold, sure I 
dread him 
Coming here every morning and night. 
'Twas only last week you protested 
When he courted fat Jenny McOhre°, 
That the sight of the scamp you detested, 
And your tongue from abuse never rested. 
NELLY.—Oh, mother—.

MoTnEu.---7Faith, then if he's your joy, go and wed him; 
But One bit'df advice I 
would give, 
With a 
motherly feeling I 
tell you, 
With Barney you never can live. 
He's too fond of gaming and dancing, 
At foot-balls, and parties, and wakes, 
And with unmarried feinales keeps prancing, 
Which always hard jealousy makes.

As the mother and Nelly were squabbling, 
Bould Barney stept in at the door,

FRED MAY'S COMIC SONGS. 
Made a 
dart at the window to Nelly, 
Took a 
smack of a 
kiss, to be sure; 
The mother, half frantic, discovering, 
Cries " Barney, you impudent brat, 
Round my house and my place you're still hovering, 
Be sure now and mind what you're at." 
NELLY.-011, mother—

NELLY.-011, mother, he's going away: oh, mother, 
he's going away; 
Oh, mother, he's going away; 
Sure, he'll make me his wife for the rest of my life, 
Oh, mother, he's going away. 
TEDDY O'NIELL. 
Sung by FRED M AY in the principal concert rooms. 
I. 
I 
dreamt but last night, oh, bad luck to the dreaming,' 
Sure, I'd die if I 
thought 'twould come truly to pass, 
I 
dreamt while the tears down my pillow were 
streaming, 
That Teddy was courting another fair lass, 
Oh, didn't I 
wake with a 
weeping and wailing, 
The grief of the thought was too much to conceal. 
My mother cried, N6rah, child, what is your ailing? 
But all I 
could utter was Teddy O'Niell; 
But all I 
could utter was Teddy O'Niell. 
I 
went to the cabin he danced his wild jigs in, 
As neat a 
mud palace as ever was seen. 
DUBLIN BAT. 
15 
Considering it served to keep poultry and pigs in, 
I'm sure you'll allow t'was most decent and clean; 
But now all around it looks cold, sad, and dreary, 
All sad, and all silent, no piper,' no reel, 
Not even the sun through the casement shines cheery, 
Since I 
lost the dear darling boy, Teddy O'Niell; 
Since I 
lost the dear darling boy, Teddy O'Niell. 
Shall I 
ever forget when the tig ship was ready, 
And the moment was come for my love to depart; 
How I 
sobbed like a 
spal peen good-bye to you, Teddy, 
With a 
tear on my cheek, and a 
stone on my heart. 
He said 'twas to better his fortune he wandered, 
But what would be gold to the joy I 
should feel, 
If he'd only come back to me honest and loving, 
Still poor, yet my own darling Teddy O'Niell; 
Still poor, yet )my own darling Teddy O'Niell. 
DUBLIN BAY. 
I. 
There sailed away in a 
gallant ship Roy Neil and his 
fair young bride, 
They had ventured all in the bounding barque that 
danced o'er the silvery tide; 
But their hearts were young and spirits light, as they 
dashed the tears away, 
As they watched the shore recede from sight of their 
own sweet Dublin bay. 
[Repeat the last line.] 
U. 
Three days they sailed, when a 
storm arose, and light-
ning flashed the deep,

And the thunder's crash broke th shdrt repose of

Oh, love," she cried, "'twas a

[Repeat the last line..] 
• LII. 
On the crowded deck of the doomed ship some knelt 
in mute despair, 
While some, more calm, with a 
holy lip raised their 
voice to their God in prayer; 
She's struck on the rocks, the sailors cried; in the 
depth of their wild dismay, 
The ship went down with that fair young bride that 
sailed from Dublin. bay: 
'Tis morn, and the sun does in Majesty rise, 
His bright beams illuming the waves and the skies, 
And spreading new joys o'er the dew-covered earth, 
As I 
think on the dearly-loved land of m 
Y 
birth. 
'Tis eve, and our messmates rejoice o'er the bowl, 
Which each to the other does merrily trowl; 
But I, all alone, am a 
stranger to mirth, 
And I 
think on the dearly-loved land of my birth. 
QUIET LODGINGS. 
Each day I'm the same, I 
remember her still, 
And pray heaven forever to shield her from ill; 
That she still may be ever first on the earth, 
Is my prayer for the dearly-loved land of my birth. 
QUIET LODGINGS. 
Am.—King of the Cannibal Islands. 
All you who love retirement free,. 
I'm very sure 34%11 pity me, 
Who'd been all my life used, do you see, 
To quiet country lodgings. 
You must know that word was sent me down, 
To see my good old uncle Brown, - 
Who'd died, and left me every crown, 
So I 
must come and live in town. 
I 
wrote to my cousin Jimmy Wood, 
To ask him, if he'd be so good, 
To find me in his neighborhood, 
A 
very quiet lodgings. 
All right in, town I 
arrived next day, 
And to my lodgings went straightway, 
And. found they really were 0. K., 
A 
very quiet lodgings. 
'Twas in a 
street, I 
do declare, 
Where the river runs at the end so clear, 
And sends up .such refreshing air, 
Close by the dry dock, I 
do declare. 
Says my landlady, with looks demure, 
You'll find them clean and very pure. 
So I 
took them for a 
twelve-month, sure, 
Those very quiet lodgings.

FRED MAY 'S COMIC SONGS. 
Next morning, just before I 
rose, 
Or popt my head from 'neath the clothes, 
I 
heard a 
brute chanting—" Off she goes," 
In front of my quiet lodgings, 
And scarcely had he moved away, 
And I 
hoped to be quiet all the day, 
When an organ-grinder began to play, 
" 
Nix my dolly, pals fake away;" 
And when this too had left the place. 
There came two fifes and a 
double bass, 
Blowing away in my very face, 
In front of my quiet lodging's. 
To rave and curse I 
did begin, 
To find how I'd been taken in, 
When another infernal musical din, 
Saluted my quiet lodgings. 
A man with bagpipes now had come. 
Blowing out such a 
rumtitum, 
Just like a 
donkey's bray, by gum, 
'Twas enough to knock the devil dumb; 
And not content with number four, 
It kept the street in a 
wild uproar, 
For he played six tunes at every door, 
Each side of my quiet lodgings. 
V. 
My dinner I 
hoped to get in peace, 
But, Lord, the nuisance wouldn't cease, 
In fact, it seemed more to increase 
Around my quiet lodgings. 
A 
German brass band came in view, 
With drums, cornets, and cymbals too, 
THE VORKHOUSE BOY. 
1.9 
And kicked up such a 
fillaloo, 
I 
wished they'd blOwn themselves in two; 
But scarcely had these fellows fled,• 
When two chaps, by instinct led, 
Began to punch each other's head, 
In front of my quiet lodgings. 
VI. 
With rage I 
then did puff and swell, 
Out by the roots I 
pulled the bell; 
The landlady rushed in pell mell, 
To my very quiet lodgings. 
"Are these your quiet lodgings, pray? 
I'll leave your house this very day." 
" 
Oh, but before you go away, • 
A 
twelvemonth's rent you've got to pay." 
I 
paid the money with sad grimace, 
I 
rushed out of the cursed place, 
And slammed the door in the old hag's fact, - 
And cursed my quiet lodgings. 
As 
sung by SAM COWXLL. 
I. 
The cloth was laid in the vorkhouse hall, 
The great coats hung ' gainst the vitevashed vall, 
The paupers they hall looked blythe and gay, 
A 
keepin' their Christmas ' oliday. 
The master he cried, with a 
roguish leer, 
"You'll hall get fat on your Christmas cheer." 
Ven von, by his looks he seemed to say, 
He'd like some more soup on this festival day.

Am.—Ilattlin' Ilovin' Blade. 
I. 
I was born in the town of Tip so gay, 
Where the boys they welt the flure away; 
Faith, I 
fell in love, my boys, do you see, 
And the girl I 
loved was Biddy Magee. 
Too ra la too ral. 
'I wint to the fair one summer's day, 
Dressed in my Sunday frieze so gay, 
An' in a 
tint I 
wint so free, 
And there I 
Met wid Biddy Magee. 
I called for a 
naggin of the old ding dong, 
Just to give a 
polish to the song; 
I 
paid for the same so frank and free, 
And the first toothful I 
gave was to Biddy Magee. 
rv. 
I 
gave her a 
chuck under the chin, 
My blarney tale I 
did begin; 
To be my wife she did agree, 
So condescending was Biddy Magee. 
v. 
Then, my boys, a 
week after that, 
Biddy she invited her darling Pat, 
The boys I 
invited to join in the spree, 
Of the wedding of Pat and Biddy Magee.

There was tall Maguire and Dinny O'Moore, 
Phalim and Tim to welt the flure; 
McGorrnan, the fiddler, who never could see, 
lie came to squint at Biddy Magee. 
The whiskey went round in quarts, galore, 
Those who were knocked up fell on the floor, 
Thin Phaley and Tim to kick up a 
spree, 
Swore they'd have the first kiss from Biddy Magee. 
VIII. 
I 
bate the divils that very night, 
And put the company all to flight. 
Says I, " my boys, you've found out, do you see, 
The kisses you'll get from Biddy Magee. 
We finished the row as it did begin, 
Thin Biddy and I 
put out the glim; 
We went to bed quite drunk, do you see, 
And there I 'gan huggin' Biddy Magee.

We hadn't been married a 
month, 'tis true, 
Whin she brought me twins—oh, two, 
Says I, " my dear, this won't agree," 
"Just like their dad," says Biddy Magee. 
"Faith," sis I, " 
it's very soon, 
To bring your work home from the loom, 
You took a 
lesson from the bee." 
" 
I 
don't like to be idle," says Biddy Magee. 
Says I, " my dear, they're not like me." 
" 
Oh, but indeed they are," says she, 
"Irish manufacture, it's true, do you see, 
An' you're the pattern,".says Biddy Magee.

At the childer I

With long spades and pitchforks to ride home the 
bride.

And you're welcome, all heartily welcome,

As for the bride she was comely and fair, 
And as small in the waist as a 
two-year old mare. 
When she opened her,jaws they spread like raven's 
.Wings, 
And with tearing bull-beef she burst both her eye-
strings. 
The bride she was dressed in a 
short bodied gown, 
Her skirt was green ,

Her bodice was white, trimmed with blue all round, 
And her hat was a 
castor that cost her a 
pound. 
They had for their dinner a 
very fat goose' 
Stuffed up with potatoes when she was let loose. 
They had slashings of beef that cam from afar, 
And scullions *ere drawn on a 
slipping side- car. 
Of barley-meal bannock-s 
they had twenty score, 
With stacks of call cannon and butter, galore,

They'd a 
jar of good whiskey from a 
still of their own, 
And a 
sloop load of herrings came down from Tyrone. 
They'd a 
great pratie pudding, baked in a 
lime-kiln,. 
Where ladies and gentlemen might eat their fill; 
The tail of a 
rat, and the brains of a 
ram, 
Stuffed in a 
pig's bladder, and fried on a 
pan. 
The bride she sat at the top of the room, 
She walloped the grub with both knife, fork, and 
spoon, 
She called for a 
towel, 'twas handed in speed, 
When a 
piece of a 
bed-tick was handed indeed. 
The bride and the groom they danced, to be sure, 
For once their old brogues never parted the flure; 
They wiggled and waggled to the lilt of the bag, 
But their favorite tune it was 
Moll in the Wad." 
She danced till the strings of her petticoats broke, 
And with her bare buttocks she humored the joke; 
The piper lay over, as blind as a 
goat, 
While the cat eat his bags and the tails of his coat. 
When this noble couple retired to bed, 
With old shoes and stockings they bolstered their 
heads; 
Arrah, will you lay over, and let us play fair, 
Take your hand out of that, for you'll get nothing 
there. 
Were you ever at the wedding of Kelly Poreen, 
Such a 
wedding you never have seen; 
They danced, and they pranced, till their heads went 
astray, 
And they danced banalang till the noon of next day.

SIMON THE CELLARER. 
As sung by HErini DRAYTON and HARRY nunsox. 
Old Simon the Cellarer keeps a 
rare store 
Of Malmsey and Malvoisie 
And Cyprus, and who can say how many more ? 
For a 
chary old soul is he— 
A chary old soul is he. 
Of sack and canary he never doth fail, 
And all the year round there is brewing of ale; 
Yet he never aileth, 
quaintly doth say, 
While he keeps to his sober six flagons a 
day; 
But ho! 
ho! his nose cloth show 
How oft the black jack to his lips doth go. 
But ho ho! ho! his nose doth show 
how oft the black jack tc his lips doth go. 
Dame Margery sits in her own still room, 
A matron sage is she; , 
From thence oft at curfew is wafted a 
fume, 
She says it is rosemarie— 
She says it is rosemarie. 
But there's a 
small cupboard behind the back stair, 
And the maids say they often see Margery there. 
New, Margery says that she'grows very old, 
And must take a 
something to keep out the dold; 
But, ho! ho! ho! old Simon doth know 
Where many a 
flask of his best doth go. 
30 
FRED MAY'S COMIC SONGS. 
Old Simon reclines in his high-backed chair, 
And oft talks about taking a 
wife, 
And Margery often is heard to declare 
She ought to be settled in life— 
She ought to be settled in life. 
But Margery has—so the maids say—a 
tongue, 
And she's not very handsome, nor yet very young, 
So somehow it ends with a 
shake of the head, 
And old Simon he brews him a 
tankard instead, 
While, ho! ho! ho! he will chuckle and crow, 
" 
What! marry old Margery? No! no! no! 
CABBAGE GREEN-. 
A 
parody on the Ivy Green. 
A 
dainty plant is the cabbage green, 
Wot grows in the garden bold; 
With a 
gammon of bacon, half fat and lean, 
It's good either hot or cold; 
The leaves must be tender and not decayed, 
To pleasure your dainty whim; 
And the cove that loves cabbage, I'll tell the blade, 
It's & jolly good feed for him. 
CHORUS. 
Sprouting out of the ground he's seen, 
A 
dainty plant is the cabbage green; 
Sprouting out of the ground he's seen, 
A 
rare old plant is the cabbage green. 
Fast he sprouts, for he's food for kings, 
And a 
right choice heart has he; 
flow tightly he sticketh, how tightly he clings 
To the stalk till he's quite stumpy; 
THE IRISH JANITTS.. 
31 
In a 
wagon he's trotted along to town, 
And his leaves no longer waves, 
For he's packed like a 
convict, ,and quite turned 
brown, 
As his way to Fulton market he paves. 
Sprouting out of the ground he's seen, &T. 
Full wages have fled, hard work's ill 1:>id, 
And grub very scarce has been; 
But the stout old cabbage shall never fade 
From being a 
cove wot's green; 
The hardy old plant in his lonely days, 
Shall fatten you up quite fast; 
And the best of vegetables man can raise 
Is the cabbage, my boys, at last. 
Sprouting out of the ground he's seen, 
That rare old plant the cabbage green; 
Sprouting out of the ground he's seen, 
That rare old chap the cabbage green.

The better to think what was best to decide, 
For a 
rumbling grumbling jalap and jaundice fit, 
Heigh°, in grief for poor Tommy. 
Poor Tom was licked, she couldn't tell how. 
Heigh°, poor Tommy. 
She gave him some milk, quite warm from the cow, 
But that made, him worse, and he kicked up a 
row, 
With his rumbling, grumbling, &c. 
While she wept from her heart, and hung down her 
head, ' 
Heigho, poor Tommy. 
On the hearth With her pillow she made him a 
bed, 
With a 
napkin then bound up the poultice she made. 
For the rumbling, grumbling, &c. 
Tom urged by his gripes to struggle and stretch, 
Heigh°, poor Tommy. 
" 
Lord, bless me," cried she, " I'm an unhappy wretch, 
Oh, what shall I 
do? I 
the doctors must fetch." 
To your rumbling; grumbling, &c.

With his rumbling, grumbling, &c. 
As Tommy refused to swallow the pill, 
Heigh°, poor Tommy, 
The doctor used force, and against Tonimy's will, 
He blew the pill down through the hole of a 
quill, 
With a 
rumbling, grumbling, & c. 
Lest the pill should too long in the thorax lurk, 
Heigh°, poor Tommy, 
He took up by the ear, and gave Tommy a

That downwards the physic the quicker might work. 
With its rumbling, grumbling, &c. 
Then to comfort his stomach Miss fed him with pap, 
Heigh°, poor Tommy.

Oh, I 
am a 
gay and rambling boy, 
From Tipperary town I'came; 
And poverty has compelled me, 
To turn out in the rain, 
In all sorts of weather let it be wet or dry, 
It was my fate, and I 
knew my state, 
I 
could neither laugh nor cry.

Oh come buy my humble ditty, 
From tavern to tavern I 
steer, 
Like every other good fellow, 
I 
like my glass of beer, 
For I 
am the rambling son of poverty, 
And the son of Michael O'Feer. 
Oh, cold winter is a 
coining, 
And I 
have no clothes to clad; 
I 
have left none behind me, 
I 
have got all on my back. 
My coat cost ten and sixpence, 
About twenty years ago; 
And I 
bought it from a 
clothier, 
us name I 
do not know. 
My stockings cost me fourpence, 
And I 
thought the price was high; 
My shirt I 
picked up in the dirt, 
Where Barney used to lie; 
My hat I 
bought of a 
soldier, 
And the lining from it was tore, 
And the oil cloth that was over it, 
For seven long years was wore. 
My gloves they are not fellows, 
But that is nothing rare, 
One I 
picked up in Chatham street,' 
The other in Franklin square; 
I

LIMERICK RACES. 
I'm a 
simple Irish boy, resolved to see some fun, sir, 
So to satisfy my mind to Limerick town I 
come, sir; 
Oh, murther, what a 
pretty place, and what a 
charm-
ing city, 
Where the boys they are so free, and the girls they 
are so pretty. 
'Twas on the first of May that I 
began my rambles, 
And every thing looked gay with jaunting cars and 
gambles; 
I 
looked along the road, all lined with smiling faces, 
A driving in all shapes, and going to Limerick races. 
'Twas then I 
was resolved to go and see thd races, sir, 
So behind a 
coach and four I 
nately took my place, 
sir; 
When a 
boy bawled out behind, and the coachman 
dealt a 
blow, sir, 
And he hit me just as fair as if his eye was in his 
pole, sir. 
Oh then, I 
had to walk, and make no great delay, sir, 
Until I 
reached the course, where every thing looked 
gay, sir; 
38 
FRED MAY'S COM1O SONGS. 
And there I 
spied a 
wooden house, and in the upper 
story, 
A band struck up a 
tune, 'twas--" Garryow!n and 
glory." 
There was fiddlers' playing jigs, and lads and lasses 
dancing, 
And boys upon their nags around the course was 
prancing; 
Some were drinking whiskey punch, and others 
bawled out gaily, 
"Hurrah for the shamrock green, and a 
splinter of 
shillelah." 
There was " betters, to and fro, to see which horse, 
would win, sir, 
And sporting boys, you know, with their pockets full 
of tin, sir; 
One said, " I'll bet you twenty pounds, and put it 
down this minute, 
But says I, I'll bet you twenty pounds that the fore-
most horse will win it." 
'Twas then I 
went to town, but long I 
didn't stay, sir, 
Sure, I 
paid my two thirteens to go and see-the play, 
sir; 
There was coblers, kings, and queens, and Columbines, 
and fairies, 
But I 
thought myself at home when they struck up 
"Paddy Carey."

One summer's eVe,_ when labor was o'er,

Came to our village begging. 
I 
pitied his sad mournful tale,. 
For at pity I'm . no railer, 
Then pray bestow your charity on me,

Despise me not, I 
pray now don't, 
Because in shabby rigging, 
If I 
had my limbs I'd rather work, 
Than I'd be seen a 
begging ; 
I'm like a 
ship distressed at sea, 
Without a 
friend to hail her, 
Then, pray, bestow your charity on me, 
A 
poor old worn-out sailor. 
False reports came home that I 
was dead, 
My poor wife died broken-hearted, 
My daughter roamed, I 
know not where, 
And forever we were parted. 
.I was shipwrecked of all in this world I 
held dear, 
Poor girl, I 
oft bewail her, 
If I 
could find her, she'd a 
comfort be, 
To a

And as he sung his monrnful song,

And clasped him to her bosom.

THE OLD MOUSQUETEER. 
Weath a 
vine-covered porch sat an old mousqueteer, 
Watching intently a 
fair child at play; 
The toys round him scattered, tho' simple they were, 
Won the old soldier's thoughts far away. 
At the sound of the drum he was feeble no more, 
But flourished his crutch in the air, 
If a 
soldier you'd be, find a 
tutor in me. 
"Shoulder arms, shoulder arms, shoulder arms, 
Shoulder arms!" cried the brave mousqueteer. 
Then the old soldier spoke of warlike array, 
He built mimic rampart

a d storm''d 
towers, 
Oh, the heart of a 
soldier whs formed on that day, 
In that garden of fresh wild flowers. 
1Twas thus, boy," he cried, " our emperor stood,

With my knapsack, my belt, and batter'd canteen, 
At Jena and Wagram, the east and the west, 
With the old mousqueteer have they been. 
I

But prudence still whispers beware; 
For the period draws nigh when grim death will cry, 
Pile your arms, pile your arms, pile your arms, 
Pile your arms to the old mousqueteer." 
JUDGE NOT A MAN. 
Judge not a 
man by the cost of his clothing, 
Unheeding the life-path that he may pursue; 
Or, oft you'll admire a 
heart that needs loathing, 
And fail to give honor where honor is due. 
The palms may be hard, the fingers stiff jointed, 
The coat may be tatter'd, the cheek worn with 
tears; 
But greater than kings are labors anointed, 
You can't judge a 
man by the coat that he wears. 
[Repeat the two last lines of each rerse.] 
Give me the man, as a 
friend and a 
neighbor, 
Who toils at the loom, the spade, or the plough, 
Who wins his diploma of manhood by labor, 
And purchases wealth by the sweat of his brow. 
And that man shall be found 'mid the close ranks of 
labor, 
And be known by the work which his industry 
rears; 
And the chiefdom when won shall be dear to hiN 
labor, 
And we'll honor the man whatever he wears.

Watch well the path that each is pursuing, 
And let the most worthy be chief in the land. 
Why should the broadcloth alone be respected, 
And the man be despised who in fustian appears? 
While the angels in heaven have their limbs unpro-
tected, 
You can't judge a

orphan wept; 
And shivering on the doorstep he raised his eyes to 
where, 
Amid the warm and glittering halls the rich man 
slumbered there. 
MORTIS. 
Dream on, dream on, thou sleeper, nor heed the tem-
pests roar, 
'While the orphan child is weeping in rags beside thy 
door. • 
Amid the gathering snowdrift there comes a 
stalwart 
form, 
That breasts the icy whirlwind and struggles in the 
storm; 
He bends above the outcast, then looks above to 
where, 
Amid the warm and cheerfuliall the rich man shim-
bered there.

Well done, well done, thou watcher, he folds him to 
his breast, 
And within his arms he bears him where his drocp-
ing head may rest; 
And in after years his bosom felt no thrill that seemed 
so sweet, 
As the memory of that midnight hour and the orphan 
in the street.

Here are fashion and form of a 
modernized date, 
But I'd rather have looked on the old farm-gate. 
[Repeat two last lines of each verse.] 
'Twas here that my sisters would gather to play, 
In the shadow of twilight or sunny midday; 
How we laughed and run wild 'mid those hillocks of 
sand, 
Where temptations existed no child could withstand, 
But to swing on the gate-rail, to clamber and ride 
Was the utmost of pleasure, of glory, and pride, 
And the car of the victor, or carriage of state 
Never carried such hearts as that old farm-gate. 
Oh, fair is the barrier taking its place, 
But it darkens a 
picture my soul longs to trace; 
I 
sigh to behold the rough staple and hasp, 
And the rails that my growing hands scarcely could 
clasp; 
Oh, how strangely the warm spirit grudges to part 
With the commonest relics once linked to the heart; 
And the brightest of fortune the kindliest fate, 
Would not blemish ray love for that old farm-gate.

They flock out like a 
swarm of bees, 
Each summer's afternoon, 
Upon the pave so sportive, 
Decked with carmine and perfume, 
The passing swells enticing, 
" 
Come here, my duck," they'll say, 
The gay girls of New York, 
A 
stunning race are they. 
With smiles they make us pass by, 
Then for new togs they sigh; 
And. often hint they'd like a 
draln, 
To wet this little eye. 
For when they swear they love you best, 
Be cautious how you stay, 
For the merry girls of New York town 
An artful race are they. 
Then let us always act like bricks, 
And when they shivering stand, 
In lonely streets, 'mid frost and snow, 
Oh, lend a 
helping hand; 
That fortune then may bless your lot, 
They fervently will pray; 
For the merry girls of New York 
A 
grateful race are they. 
SMUGGLER KING. 
There's a

From her nest in the Bustling bay: 
The fresh breeze meets her dingy sheets, 
And swiftly she flies away.

She never must run in the light of the sun, 
But along with the owl take wing; 
She must keep her flight for the moonlight night, 
For she carries the -smuggler king. 
[Repeat two last lines of each verse.] 
A 
monarch is he as bold as can be, 
Of a 
strong and daring band; 
The bullet and blast may go whistling past, 
But he quails neither heart nor hand. 
He lives and he dies with his fearful prize, 
Like a 
hunted wolf he'll spring 
With trigger and dirk, t
o the deadliest work, 
And fight like a 
smuggler king. 
Back, back from the wave, to his home hi the cave; 
'.Neath the sheen of the torches' glare, 
.1Ie reigns the lord of a 
freebooter's board, 
And never was costlier fare. 
Right firm and true are the hearts of his crew, 
There's faith in the shouts that ring, 
As they stave the cask, and drain the flask, 
And drink to the sthuggler king. , 
ST. KEVIN AND KING O'TOOLE. 
St. Kevin once was travelling through a 
place called 
Glendalough, 
He chanced to meet with King O'Toole, and he axed 
him for a 
shough; 
Says the king, " you're but a 
stranger, for your face 
I 
have never 'seen, *, 
But if you have a 
taste of weed I'll lend you my dhu-

47, 
While the saint was kindling up the pipe, the mon-
arch gave a 
sigh, 
"Is there any thing the matter," says the saint, " that 
makes you cry?" 
Says the king, " I 
had a 
gander that was gave me by 
my mother, 
And this morning he has cocked his toes :with some 
disease or other." 
"Are you. crying for the gander, you unfortunate 
old goose, 
Dry up your tears in fretting, sure the devil take the 
use;" 
Says the saint, " what would you give me if the gan-
der I'd revive, 
Says the king, " I'd be your servant all the days that 
I'm alive." 
"I'll cure him," says the saint, " but I 
want no sar-
vint man, 
But if I'd not make too bould to ax I'd like a 
bit of 
land; 
As you think so much about the bird, if I 
make him 
whole and sound, 
Will you give me the taste of land the gander does fly 
round." 
"In troth, I 
will, and welcome," says the king, " give 
what you ask," 
" 
Says the saint, " then bring the gander, and I'll be-
gin the task." 
The king went to the palace for to fetch him out the 
bird; 
Tho' he'd not the least intintion of sticking to his 
word. 
54 
FRED MAY'S COMIC SONGS. 
St. Kevin took the gander from the arms of the ould 
king; 
He first began to twig his beak, and then to stretch 
his wing. 
He hooshed him up into the air, he flew twenty miles 
• 
around. 
Says the saint, " I'd thank your majesty for that little 
bit of ground." 
The king to raise a 
ruction, faith he called the saint a 
witch, 
And sent in for his six big sons to heave him in the 
ditch. 
"Nabocklish," says St. Kevin, " now I'll settle these 
young urchins," 
He turned the king and his six sons into the seven 
churches. 
Thus King O'Toole was punished for his dishonest 
doings, . 
The saint then left the gander for to guard about the 
ruins. 
If you go there on a 
summer's day, between twelve 
and one o'clock, 
You'll see the gander flying round the glen of Glenda-
lough. 
Now I 
think there is a 
moral attached unto my song, 
To punish men is only right wheniver they do wrong. 
For poor men they may keep their word much better 
than folks grander, 
For the king begrudged to pay the saint for curing 
his ould gander.

Oh, ever a 
rover's life for me, 
,A gallant bark and a 
rol1ig sea; 
On my own proud deck like a 
king I 
stand: 
-Where brave hearts bow to their chief's command. 
With canvass spread where'er I 
roam, 
The deep deep sea's to me a 
home; 
And my heart on this will ever be, 
With the black flag floating gallantly. 
[Repeat the last line]. 
Tho' thunder storms and lightning's flash, 
Onward my bark will proudly dash; 
Swift as the flight of the hawk she'll sail, 
And proudly ride through the wildest gale; 
I'll shun no foe, I'll strike to none, 
With broadsword gleaming, or mounted gip; 
But I'll meet them on the broad blue sea, 
With the black flag floating gallantly.

As sung by FRED MAY with thunders of applause, in the theatres and

A 
parody on " Cheer, boys, cheer," by FRED M AI'. 
Di'ink, boys, drink, the beer is now before us, 
Drown all our sorrows, care, grief, and pain; 
Sing, and be merry, all join in the chorus, 
Pass round the lush, call the landlord in again. 
Here, take the can, let it be filled again, boys, 
We'll not forget the time fit for mirth, 
Sing comic songs, and never forget our joys, 
Join hand and hand, and prove we're lads of mirth.

Beer, boys, beer, for this and every land. 
Think, boys, drink, the tankard round we're sending, 
Braces each frame, but as through life we pass, 
NeN,er reflect on the time we here are spending, 
Nor iike a 
drunkard be too fond of the glass: 
The day that we toil it plenty will procure us, 
Our borne we'll support, let that care be the first, 
Now ere we part a 
toast, and then the chorus, 
May this hour we're spending of our lives be the

VERY POLITE OF TIER.

VERY POLITE OP HER. 
One night to a.concert I 
went, 
, I 
was dressed in my best from top to toe, 
Where many an evening I 
spent 
'Mongst the ladies, dear creatures, I 
love to go,. 
I 
walked up the room in good style, 
There sat a 
sweet lass, I 
caught sight of her; 
She said, take a 
chair, gave a 
smile; 
Now was't that mighty polite of her? 
Cnonus.—Foldi dollol de di rol. 
As we sat side by side on the chair, 
My very heart strings seemed to crack again; 
I 
threw a 
sheeps' eye at the dear, 
And she in return threw it back again. 
I 
called for a 
bottle of wine, 
Which very much gladdened the sight of her; 
She drank both her own share and mine; 
Now was'nt that very polite of her ? 
, 
Said I, Miss, take something to eat; 
I 
thought she would like a 
nice taste, so I 
Went into a 
shop down the street, 
And bought half a 
dollar's worth of pastry. 
A 
puff, tart, or gooseberry pie, 
She said it was quite the delight of her; 
They were gone in the wink of your eye; 
Don't you think that was mighty polite of her? 
To drink negus I 
gained her consent, 
Forgetting my landlord had called that day; 
Till every dollar I 
spent; 
Good Lord, thinks I, there's the rent to pay. 
• 
I 
did not expect her abuse, 
Which you must all own was'nt right of her, 
When she said, I 
am married, you goose: 
Now say, was that very polite of her ? 
With rage -T 
began for to stamp, 
When a 
fellow came in and did bounce about; 
He said if I 
did not decamp, 
My head he quickly would trounce about. 
He hit me a 
blow here about, 
Which knocked me flat down in the sight of her; 
She said, now he's down serve him out; 
• 
Do you think that was very polite of her! 
At length the police were called in, 
And over the room they did follow me, 
Without knowing the cause of the din, 
Two lanky blue devils did follow me. 
For assistance and mercy I 
prayed, 
She said I 
intruded in spite of her; 
To the station they had me conveyed; 
Now was'nt that mighty polite of her? 
Next morning the fine was a 
pound, 
To give this sweet damsel to quit her; 
No money nor friend could be found, 
So they sent me to jail as a 
rioter. 
My landlord a 
letter next sent, • 
He seized on my sticks every mite of ' ern. 
As I 
owed him five dollars for rent; 
Now wasn't that very polite of him ? 
But at length T 
got free from the jail 
Wherein I 
had shown my agility; 
Folks say I 
look wonderful pale, 
But the picture of respectability. 
Could I 
see a 
young lady divine, 
- And my figure, and form please the sight of her, 
gra 
And she would consent to be mine, 
I 
shall take it as very polite of her. 
PADDY'S VISIT TO THE THEATRE. 
From the swat() town of Limerick lately I 
came, 
To vie W 
this fine city, John Doody's my name; 
My Cousin Pat Casey I 
met tother day, 
Says he, will you come and we'll go see the play. 
Cuouns.—Derry down, down, derry lie down. 
Is it the play that you mane, sure, Casey, you're 
right, 
For they trate the whole town with PizarrO to 
night; 
will if you'll trate me to things nate and cane, 
But the - 
trate as he call'd it cost me all my tin. 
The curtain drew up and a 
lady I 
spied, 
A man came to kiss her, she scornfully cried: 
Get out, you big blaekguard. I'll bother your jig, 
When in came Pizarro, who growled like a 
pig. 
In the days of king Ferdy" a 
long time ago, 
When the Spaniards all marched to Peru, you must 
know, 
Shying, give us your jewels, your cash, and your 
keys. 
But a 
boy they called Rolla says, not, if you please.

star in the day time appeared, 
He made a 
long speech and the sogers all cheered, 
Saying lather the dons, boys, and do the nate thing 
Arrah, who wouldn't fight for his country and king 
Then arose a 
hubbaboo, confusion, and strife, 
And Rolla, God bless him, he saved the kings life, 
Then went to Alonzo cooped up in a 
jail 
And letting him go stuck himself in for bail. 
Then in came Pizarro, and with him a 
gossoon, 
That was handled by Rolla as I 
would a 
spoon, 
But as he was crossing a 
bridge o'er the green, • 
He was shot by a 
villain behind a 
big screen. 
Then in came Rolla' and with him the child, 
Faix he looked, for all the world, like a 
man that was 
wild, • 
Saying, " take the dear creature, it's my own blood 
that's spilt, 
In defince of your child, blood an ouns, how I'm kilt." 
Then Alonzo gave Pizarro a 
murthering blow, 
That laid him as low as ould Brian Born, 
And Rolla's poor body was laid out in state, 
And all the ould sogers smoked pipes at his wake. 
Then Alonzo came forward and handsomely bowed, 
Saying, " ladies and gintlemen," maning the crowd, 
It's with your permission to-morrow night then 
We will murther Pizarro right over again.

PADDY MILES. 
From the big town of Limerick lately I 
came, 
I 
left Ireland solely bekase of my name, 
For if any thing went wrong, or a 
mischief was done, • 
Shure, they'd lay all the blame on my mother's own 
son. 
So my name now is Paddy O'Connor, 
Pon an Irishman's true word and honor; 
Miss Fortune my curse light upon her, 
• 'Twas she christened me Paddy Miles. 
If a 
window was broke, or a 
house robbed of tiles, 
And you'd as who done that ? fais, they'd say Paddy 
Miles. 
Who was it set fire to his riverince's wig, 
And cut the tail off of Pat Flanagan's pig; 
Who called Mrs. Mulrooney a 
schallop 
And gave Biddy Magee's cat the jalap? 
Some blackguard would hit me a 
wallop, 
And say it was you Paddy Miles. 
I 
worked in the bogs, and behaved well I 
thought, 
From my master Mick Flynn, a 
karactat I 
bought, 
But it done me no good, which I 
thong it mighty od: 4 
So I 
made up my mind for to lave the ( uld sod. 
For the divil a 
one would employ me, 
The girls they all tried to annoy me, 
They threatened at once to destroy me 
All bekase I 
was called Paddy Miles.

The jackeens kept calling myself to annoy, 
There goes Paddy Miles, he's a 
Limerick boy. 
Till I 
flourished my sprig of shillelah, 
And smothered their gobs so ginteely, 
Whin the blood it began to flow freely, 
Says I, " How do you like Paddy Miles?" 
In short, before long to this country I 
came, 
And found Paddy Miles out here just the same, 
If my name wasn't changed I 
was likely to starve, 
For the divil a 
master could I 
get to sarve. 
So Paddy O'Connor it's made, sir, 
And if you want a 
smart blade, sir, 
Be my sowl, then you needn't be afraid, sir, 
For to hire me I'm not Paddy Miles. 
TRUE—BORN IRISHMAN. 
Oh, I 
have got an illigant name 
And who dare say it's not; 
was born one day at Killboggin's town, 
In a 
nate little mud-built cot. 
My 
father was the pride of the boys all round, 
And my mother she was that same; 
DON'T SPEAR OF A MAN AS YOU FIND HIM. 
65 
An that's how it is, my honeys, do you see, 
That I've got sich an illigant name. 
CIIORUS. 
I'm the broth of a 
boy, deny it who can, 
For my mother is a 
true-born Irishman; 
I'm the broth of a 
boy, deny it who can, 
For my mother is a 
true-born Irishman. 
Sure, an Irishman will fight like the divil himself, 
And fright him you ne'er can; 
They are the bravest set of boys that ever was found 
Since first the world began. 
With the whiskey in their heads, and shillelah in their 
fists, 
They'll fightlike the divil, do you see. 
They'd never say dead till they're murthered quite, 
And that's just the way with me. 
Sure Ireland's a 
place that's got great fame, 
But that I 
suppose you've all heard; 
'Tis the finest little spot that ever was found, 
It is—take an Irishman's word. 
For there's not a 
land throughout the world, 
Where the boys are so kould and free; 
They may talk of their tru7-born Englishmen, 
But an Irishman's the boy for me. 
DON'T SPEAK OF A MAN AS YOU FIND 
'Tis the fashion to make a 
great fuss about, 
Failings we find in a 
friend; 
, 
66 
FRED MAY 'S COMIC SONGS. 
Tho' we censure what's wrong in another, 
How few of our own faults we mend. 
We judge a 
man by what we can see, 
Unable his motive to trace, 
When perhaps our own conduct would be, 
Much worse were we put in his place. 
CHORUS. 
Then don't speak of a 
man as you find him, 
Unless you've a 
good word to give, 
mean to abuse when behind him, 
Be generous, live and let live. 
Tho' not very old in my time, 
I've had plenty of knocking about, 
And that poverty oft leads to crime, 
Is a 
truth I'm unwilling to doubt. 
With character ' tis just the same, 
We always find them the most prone 
To rob others of a 
good name, 
Who have not a 
good name of their own. 
How ready some are to condemn 
Any man when he's needy and poor; 
Why not work. 
and be happy like them. 
It must be his own faultiehey are sure. 
Situations there must be in plenty, 
That would his condition advance, 
When really there's not one in twenty 
Would give a 
poor beggar a 
chance. 
An acquaintance you meet in the street, 
And hope to find in him a 
friend; 
You say you've your rent for to meet, 
And hope he'll a 
dollar or two lend. 
Ms excuse is he really can't spare it, 
You turn on your heel with a 
Gurse; 
When the truth is if he'd only declare it, 
He had not a 
dime in his purse. 
Of charges now this is the oddest, 
To blame a 
young man when he's gay, 
When perhaps he'd be prudent and Modest, 
If chance were not thrown in his way. 
Women say men are wicked deceivers 
With hearts made of iron and stone; 
While if in such faith they're believers, 
Oh! why don't they leave us alone. 
Now I 
don't wish to keep you too long, 
For fear I 
might fail to amuse; 
So to prove it, I'll finish my song 
With a 
toast that you cannot refuse. 
Here's success to the man who delights 
In deserving a 
good honest name; 
While he who his neighbor backbites, 
May he hear his own failings with shame. 
Mg LEARNED MAN. 
S'Amle the distant day I 
prattled o'er 
The horn book and the battle door, 
What musty tones I've prattled o'er, 
And yet I've scarce began. 
Then if I've volubility, 
I'll tell with what facility_ 
And wondrous ability, 
I've studied if I 
can.

FRED MAY'S COMIC SONGS. 
If of your verses, any fit, 
I'll show you in a 
trice, 
How you'd derive great benefit 
By taking my advice. 
First shake off all timidity, 
Apply with due solidity, 
Eschewing every quidity, 
To be a 
learned man. 
Commence with etymology, 
Go next to geneology, 
Your head fill with chronology 
Although it be a 
ban. 
Then go on to anthology, 
And physico theology, 
Observing strict philology, 
Go wrong you never can. 
Mix up no lampoonery 
In what you say or do, 
And let no vile buffoonery, 
E'er emanate from you. 
If you touch on the magistical, 
Celestial, or terrestrial, 
Let it not be cathechristical 
To be a 
learned man. 
If you'd display chirography, 
In any one's biography, 
Look well to your geography, 
Times and dates well scan; 
Antediluvian history, 
Of mythology the mystery, 
Theogony consistory, 
To study be your plan. 
And if past mediocrity, 
in wisdom you would soar, 
A 
• 
TIIE LEARNED MAN. 
Go on with all alacrity, 
In search of further lore, 
Then turn to botanology, 
Give a 
glance at mineralogy, 
And ditto ichtheology, 
To be a 
learned man. 
Learn alchemy by particle, 
Theurapeutics every article, 
And pharmacy cathartical, 
Or emilical you can; 
But there's a 
multiplicity, 
Of etceteras electricity, 
Computation with facility, 
O'er which I 
have not ran. 
Architecture, ichnography, 
And diaptrics you learn, 
From cosmography to topography, 
And mechanisms turn; 
Forms of government theocracy, 
And that one termed democracy, 
Not for genocracy, 
Te be a 
learned man. 
ENCORE VERSES. 
To oratory turn your mind, 
And diacoustics you will find, 
Will with each other be combined, 
If a 
public life's your plan; 
And then, as you progressive be, 
Mind that you don't digressive be, 
But let your looks expressive be, 
Go wrong yon never can. 
Didactics, dialectics, 
And orthmpy you learn, 
Taking care that inconsistency, 
And discongruity 
spurn: 
69 
FRED MAY'S COMIC SONGS. 
Then let originality, 
Ideality, causuality, 
To be blended with morality 
To be a 
learned man. 
Then go next to astrography, 
But skipping adnography, 
Take lessons in stenography, 
And practice when you can; 
Avoiding all tautology, 
Of no use is amphibology, 
But come bump on phrenology, 
And all its points we'll scan; 
And you must get anthology, 
Imprinted in your mind, 
Astronomy, astrology, 
By you must be defined; 
And don't be egotistical, 
But by your knowledge stand or fall, 
And when you've learned this budget all, 
You'll be a 
learned man. 
I 
WAS THE BOY FOR BEWITCHING TTTEM. 
I 
WAS the boy for bewitching them, 
Whether good humor'd or coy: 
All cried, when I 
was beseeching them, 
"Do what you will with me, joy." 
"Daughters be cautious and steady," 
Mothers would cry out for fear— 
" 
Won't you take care now of Teddy, 
Oh! he's the divil, my dear."

For I 
was the boy for bewitching them, 
Whether good humor'd or coy; 
All cried when I 
was beseeching them, 
"Do what you will with me, joy." 
From every quarter I 
gather'd them, 
Very few rivals had I; 
If I 
found any I 
leather'd them, 
And that made them look mighty shy. 
Pat Mooney, my Shelah once meeting, 
I 
twigg'd him beginning his clack—. 
Says he " at my heart I've a 
beating," 
Says I " then have one at your back." 
For I 
was the boy, &c. 
Many a 
lass that would fly away 
When other wooers but spoke, 
Once if I 
looked her a 
die-away 
There was an end of the joke. 
Beauties, no matter how cruel, 
Ilundreds of hias though they'd .crost, 
When I 
came nigh to them, jewel, 
They melted like mud in the frost. 
For I 
was the boy, &c. 
ONE BOTTLE MORE. 
ASSIST me, ye lads, who have hearts void of guile, 
To sing out the praises of ould Ireland's isle; 
Where true hospitality opens the door, 
And friendship detains us for one bottle more— 
One bottle more, arrah, one bottle more; 
And friendship detains us for one bottle more. 
Old England, your taunts on our country forbear; 
With our bulls and our brogues we are true and sincere:

For if but one bottle remains in our store, 
We have generous hearts to give that bottle more. 
One bottle more, &c. 
At Candy's, in Church street, I'll sing of a 
set 
Of six Irish blades who together had met; 
Four bottles a-piece made us call for our score, 
And nothing remain'd but just one bottle more.

IT EL LOVER. 
Wnoo! I'm a 
ranting, roving blade, 
Of never a 
thing was I 
ever afraid; 
I'm a 
gintleman born, and I.scorn a 
thrade, 
And I'd be a 
rich man if my debts was paid. 
But my debts is worth something; this truth they 
instil,— 
That pride makes us fall all against our will; 
For 'twas pride that broke me—I 
was happy until 
I 
was ruined all out by my tailor's bill. 
I'm the finest guide you ever did see, 
I 
know every place of curosity 
From Thig-d-na Vauragh to Donaghadee; 
And if you're for sport come along wid me. 
I'll lade you sporting round about— 
We've wild ducks and widgeon, and snipe, and thront; 
And I 
know where they are and what they're about, 
And if they're not at home, then I'm sure they're out.

The miles in this counthry much longer be— 
But that is a 
saving of time d'you see, 
For two of our miles is aiqual to three, 
Which shortens the road in a 
great degree. 
And the roads in this place is so plenty, we say 
That.., you've nothing to do but to find your way; 
If you're hurry's not great, and you've time to del ay, 
You can go the shortcut that's the longest way. 
And I'll show you heaps of good drinkin' too, 
For I 
know the place where the whiskey grew; 
A 
bottle is good when it's not too new, 
And I'm fond of one, but I'd die for two. 
Thruth is scarce when liars is near, 
But squealing is plenty when pigs you shear, 
And mutton is high when cows is dear, 
And runt it is scarce four times a-year. 
Such a 
country for growing you ne'er did behowld, 
We grow rich when we're poor, we grow hot when 
we're cowld; 
And the girls they know bashfulness makes us grow 
bowld; 
We grow young when we like, but we never grow 
owld. 
And the sivin small sinses grows natural here, 
For praties has eyes, and can see quite clear; 
And the kitties is singing with scalding tears, 
And the corn fields is listening with all their ears. 
But along with sivin sinses we have one more— 
Of which I 
forgot for to tell you before— 
'Tis nonsense, spontaneously gracing our shore, 
And I'll tell you the rest when I 
think of more.

THE POPE TIE LEADS A HAPPY LIFE 
CLIARLES LEN LIC. 
THE Pope he leads a 
happy life, 
He knows no cares nor marriage strife; 
He drinks the best of Rhenish wine— 
' 
would the Pope's gay lot were mine. 
But yet not happy is his life— 
He loves no maid or wedded wife, 
Nor child hath he to cheer his hope— 
I 
would not wish to be the Pope. 
The Sultan better pleases me, 
lie leads a 
life of jollity, 
Has wives as many as he will— 
I 
would the Sultan's throne then fill. 
But yet he's not a 
happy man— 
He must obey the Alcoran 
And dares not taste one drop of wine--
I 
would not that his lot were mine. 
So here I 
take my lonely stand, 
I'll drink my own, 
y 
native land; 
I'll kiss my maiden's lips divine, 
And drink the best of Rhenish wine. 
And when my maiden kisses me 
I'll fancy I 
the Sultan be; 
And when my cheering glass I 
tope 
I'll fancy then I 
am the Pope.
