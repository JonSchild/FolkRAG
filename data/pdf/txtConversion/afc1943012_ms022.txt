Bond
September 19, 1942 Doctor H. M. Bond Ft. Valley State College Ft. Valley, Georgia
Dear Doctor Bond:
I am in the midst of setting up a project which will include recording fellowships in the
South during 1943â€“44. Do you have any suggestions for persons to do such work in
Georgia for the Library of Congress. If so, I should appreciate your writing me about the
matter and suggesting that these parties themselves write me about what they have done
and are interested in doing.
I was sorry to again miss your festival at Fort Valley, but I am sure I can come next time, if
you will let me know.
My kindest regards.
Cordially yours, Alan Lomax Assistant in Charge of the Archive of American Folksong
