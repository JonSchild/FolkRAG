DAMARIS PIMENTEL - ULTRA BEAUTY SALON     
BOSTON, MA (Jamaica Plain)

My editor’s best friend Andrea Fleck Clardy suggested I interview her 
hairdresser, Damaris Pimentel at Ultra Beauty Salon located a few blocks away 
from her house. She offered us (my mother who is also my field assistant) a 
place to stay for the few days we were in town so we had an opportunity to 
spend more time in the neighborhood. 
 
Jamaica Plain is a neighborhood in Boston that is in the process of becoming 
gentrified. Old restaurants, convenient stores, hair salons and barbershops sit 
right alongside upscale restaurants, clothing boutiques and high-end grocery 
stores such as Whole Foods. While sitting on a park bench on Centre Street, 
the main street through Jamaica Plain, local residents which consisted mostly 
of Latinos, Caucasians and college students walked by. The evening before the 
interview we ate dinner at a neighborhood Latin restaurant that had been a part 
of the community for many decades. It was so authentic we needed help with 
the menu. Everyone spoke Spanish. It felt as though we were in a different 
country. We had a great meal.  
 
We arrived at Ultra Beauty Salon at noon. It’s unlike any beauty shop on the 
street. It has an upscale appearance with a large curved glass façade. Damaris 
was very down to earth and forthcoming about the changes taking place in her 
neighborhood. After the interview I photographed her styling her receptionist’s 
hair. We left around 3:00pm.
