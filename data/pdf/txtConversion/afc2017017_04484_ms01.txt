KS: This is Kim Stryker, today is September 6, 2017, it's about 9:16 AM. and we're in Delaplane 
Virginia at Arterra wines in the Tasting Room. I'm sitting here with Jason Murray, and he is the 
business manager/winemaker and owner? 
JM: Yep 
KS: And owner of Arterra Wines. We are going to talk about his experience here. Hi, Jason! 
JM: Hey, thanks so much for coming to talk to me. 
KS: So, tell me about is this place that we're in right now. 
#arterrawines #hawkmotharts #tastingroom #gallery #sandymurray #artstudio 
JM: We are in the combined Arterra Wines and Hawkmoth Arts Tasting Room and Gallery 
space. It is the environment where we do tastings of the wines that I make from grapes that we 
are growing, and from a partner site that we have about a half an hour away. And then we also 
have Sandy's studio and gallery space set along one entire wall, which is a central focal point to 
the space that we're in. And blends beautifully with the natural wooden environment that our 
building is set in and the style of building that we have constructed which is an authentic 
constructed timber frame using mortise and tenon joinery. So it's a very craftmanship-focused 
building to complement the craftsmanship of the artwork and the winemaking style. And in 
addition, on this same name floor of the building is Sandy's art studio where all of the work is 
made, and her kiln for firing her ceramic work. And she has a wood-carving station down in the 
cellar below us where the wine is produced and bottled and stored.

KS: OK. It's a beautiful space. Lots of natural wood. You’ve got very fit timbers. Do you know 
where they sourced these timbers from, they're massive! 
JM: Yes, this was a new construction timber frame. We worked with a framer who was in the 
Shenandoah Valley, his name is Joseph Sunsmith, he works with a company named 
“Sunnyschmitt” 
[00:02:43] 
JM: He sourced the timbers from North Carolina. They are white pine and modern timber 
framing tends to use conifer species because they are a strong wood but a lighter wood, so a little 
bit easier to deal with and faster-growing. So pretty ideal for this type of craftsmanship. 
KS: It's gorgeous. And so when was this built?

JM: This building was built during 2014, and the excavation work was all done early 2014, the 
frame went up late summer of 2014, we worked with the framer to assemble the frame in place. 
And then we ourselves with the help of a couple other people, finished out the entire rest of the 
construction. 
KS: Oh wow. Is that something you've done before at all? 
#carpentry #woodworking #diy #doityourself 
JM: This was kind of the culmination of life's training of all those home-improvement projects 
you do. I've built decks, put up walls, taken down walls, done floors, bathrooms, plumbing, 
electrical, I'm one of those people that any time there was a trade person around or a project 
going around, I would follow around and watch what they were doing, and then start doing for 
myself. So by the time we built this three years ago, when I would have been, I guess, 37, this 
literally put together all those different skills to be able to pull off a final product at a far lower 
price than we would have been able to afford. So we really kind of define ourselves as extreme 
do-it-yourselfers. 
[00:04:31] 
KS: Yeah, it's beautiful, I'm amazed that you were able to do all of that. It's a really amazing 
space. And so when did you guys decide to get into wine, how did you end up doing wine?

JM: That's one of the classic questions that comes through the tasting room, so we answer that 
question a lot, so if I sound like it's a pre-recorded answer. There's two sides of life that 
converged on this. One is mine, one is Sandy's. And the paths led together. in us. Very pleasant 
thing because we're married, we've been together since high school, and life has continued to 
steer us in the same direction as opposed to in different directions. That's been really nice. I'll 
circle back in a second. Having an environment we are working together but doing different 
things, that ultimately work toward the same goal in terms of business success is really nice, 
because we complement but we aren't like on top of each other doing the same things. People 
say, "oh don't work with your spouse." We're not like that. We're a team, but we have our own 
identities within us. So my background story is I grew up in agricultural area. So I was in a 4H 
family, we raised sheep, we did all the livestock fairs I worked with local farmers, from the time 
I was young. Working with sheep, cattle, cutting hay, from the time I was 13 I worked all 
summer and couldn't drive a car yet, so either took the bicycle to the fields or a farmer would let 
you drive the tractor home from work and back to work the next day. So it was the start of a 
pretty solid work ethic, I think, pretty young. And was mostly animal agriculture. My mindset 
through youth was, I'll grow up to be a veterinarian and that probably would have paid a lot 
better than what we're doing. But wasn't the right fit. And it took a short period of time to 
discover that, because during my upper years of high school, once I could drive, I worked at a 
garden center locally, and really enjoyed working around the plants. So once college started I 
went to the pre-vet program. Took about a year, year and a half in, to discover that animals really 
weren't my fit. I grew up around them, it's what I knew, so it made sense at the time. But it 
wasn't what I enjoyed and made peace with. Animals have a tendency when there's things wrong, 
Winery Workers in Virginia

and bad, like vets have to deal with at least large animal farm vets, you know, it's not always 
pleasant. And being around animals just raising them and having them, they're needy. twice a 
day you got to feed those guys. And if not, it's not a good thing. So I switched over to plants. 
Plants were a different pace and phase of lifestyle. And a vineyard does have its time-sensitive 
demands that are unforgiving, but it also has times when you can walk away from it for 7 days 
10 days and not look back, and it's OK. So plants are different. So I went into plants, got a 
bachelor's degree and a Master's Degree at the University of Maryland. And I'm lifelong friends 
with my grad school adviser, Dr. John Lea-Cox, who is great, and focused my graduate work on 
woody, perennial plants. I'd worked on irrigation management and irrigation technologies, and 
there was another student I worked with that did a nutritional component similar, but we were 
working on releasing water and nutrients for Chesapeake Bay protections, basically. So more 
advanced systems for horticulture. Learned a lot about plant stresses, and how far you can take a 
woody perennial plant before you kill it and it's still ok. So I learned a lot of things that ended up 
applying to vineyards. After graduate school, I was fortunate to get a job in Loudon County, 
Virginia, and that was as a commercial horticulturist, so I was not working with homeowners, 
but I was working with businesses. So, vineyards, fruits, vegetables, ornamentals, anything there 
was. Christmas trees, all of it. The two biggest crops were the vineyards and the Christmas trees. 
And the vineyards took the lion's share of attention, they're very intense production-focused. And 
so I had a really close working relationship with the majority of the vineyards that were in the 
northern part of the state during the time I did that. it went from 2001 through 2005. So I really 
got hooked on it in terms of it being a different form of horticulture. Most horticulture is how 
fast can you grow a plant at what yield kind of thing.

JM: Whereas vineyards can go from maximum crop productivity at lower production costs to 
very high quality at low yields. And there's a whole spectrum in-between. I’m really fascinated 
with. So I learned what does and doesn't work in Virginia vineyards by exposure to that industry. 
About halfway through that, I started a vineyard for a new grower who was going to start a 
winery in Fauquier County, and I was allowed to work on the site at Fauquier County because I 
technically worked for Loudon County. And in doing so, I ran a young vineyard for about two 
years. And when it was time to start cropping, I went on full-time, brought in a couple other 
growers for more fruit, and set up the winery and started making wine. Just from simple basics 
from knowing people, I had been to meetings, I'd read books, just the basic concept. And did that 
with that person for about 10 years. Running a lot of sides of the business. It wasn't just "you're 
the winemaker." But I ran the vineyard, I ran the winery, I spent a lot of time in the tasting room. 
I did a lot of licensing, recording, a lot of the budgetary processes, the development processes, so 
exposed to pretty much all side of things except it wasn't my checkbook. 
[00:11:04] 
 
KS: Can I just interrupt for a second, so did you have any specialized training or was that 
required of you, or they just knew that you were great at learning on your feet? How did they 
trust you to take it all over?

JM: Well the vineyard side was I had a lot more exposure and working knowledge than most 
people in the area. So the vineyard side kind of came naturally. And we found over the years this 
isn't an absolute role, but there's a lot of success in vineyards from people who are from this area. 
Because they understand our climate. And then how a plant with certain issues or susceptibilities 
that it takes that extra attention. The vineyards I came pretty naturally. And a lot of these really 
small wineries will have one individual do both the grape-growing and the wine-making. 
Because conceptually, on a higher quality perspective, it's one process. The changes you make in 
the vineyard, are intended to carry through beneficial results in the wine. So we worked on the 
premise when I went in there, that if we could grow really good fruit, the wine would be OK, and 
we could kind of learn and improve. And it is cost-saving to not have to bring in somebody who 
is super-credentialed out of California and may not adapt well to Virginia. 
[00:12:36] 
 
#fruit #grapes #winemaking 
 
JM: So I think some people may have expressed concern, others it was just "if you can show that 
you can do it, you're going to do it." And I knew people, so I had people I could call and ask 
questions and fall back on. So it wasn't a complete blind jump. But it was an eye-opening first 
year experience kind of thing. So then finally after having done that for some time, we can get 
more into my wine-making style shortly, but I developed my own style and way of doing things 
and a certain set of customer base that was really appreciative of what I was doing. And it just 
became time to move on to independence. And that's on a couple fronts. One is that the process 
for me evolved that, if you're a grape-grower, and you're growing really good fruit, you don't 
really want to give it to somebody else to make bad wine out of. So you develop making wine, so 
that you can utilize good product and then initially that to me was like the complete process. 
Then once you go beyond a conventional or cookie-cutter kind of process in wine into something 
that is different and unique, it's really hard to have someone else's name and identity and image 
represent that when their image doesn't necessarily reflect your philosophies in the wine-making.

JM: So then it's the next step to carry through owning and representing the wine in the way it 
was actually produced and the philosophy behind it. So that's the long story of how I got there, 
and secondarily in Virginia, there is an issue with professional wages in this industry because it's 
agricultural. It is a very expensive area to grow grapes and make wine. So profitability is only so 
much. This is not California wineries making gobs of money, and I'm sure a lot of those will tell 
Winery Workers in Virginia

you they don't either, but it's a hard dollar to earn in Virginia, which means the term that gets 
thrown at you is "well you can only get paid this much." Because you're only a wine-maker in 
Virginia, and that's how much winemakers in Virginia get paid. So by the time I was about 33, I 
had hit a plateau of as much as I was ever going to make in vineyards and winemaking in 
Virginia. And having had a young family at that time, it seemed a little ludicrous to spend the 
next 30 some years never making an additional dollar. So then there's one option, two options, 
change careers, or figure out how you can capitalize on your own product. Where it really came 
from in a catalyst, though, is Sandy. Sandy's story is she went to art school, she started at 
Carnegie Mellon, and she finished in the Maryland Institute College of Art in Baltimore and got 
her degree in Fine Arts. And she then went into teaching. So she initially went into the Baltimore 
City schools, working through the Walters Art Museum in Baltimore, doing project-based art 
education where art programs in the school had been discontinued. She would work with the 
classroom teachers and develop projects based on history and reading and writing and science. A 
lot of history since it was the museum. And integrate those things into the classroom. So after we 
had moved out western Maryland a little bit, that commute was a little much, and that program 
was winding down. And she got a job in the Washington County, Maryland school system. 
[00:16:32] 
KS: When is this about? 
#washingtoncountyschoolsystem 
 
JM: She would have finished undergraduate school in 2000. And worked through 2001 
approximately, and Baltimore City area, and then we moved to Washington County Maryland in 
2002. So by 2003 she was working in the Washington County School system. And she was 
initially hired there as an elementary art teacher. But she was at a magnet school that focused on- 
-"arts integration” was the term. So again going beyond just doing her art curriculum in the art 
room, to integrating projects, multi-disciplinary project-based with the classroom teachers, again 
integrating history, science, math, writing, reading. Great stuff. We feel very strongly that that 
project-based education is the most impactful form of education. The retention of kids was 
amazing. So she really enjoyed that, and over the course of time, had a transition out of the 
classroom into curriculum development and specializing in this integration work, with the 
Washington County school system. part of that transition was along the time that our first son 
was born. And so when time became a little limited early on, she went into that a couple days, 
and then it went to 3 and then 4 days and it built back up.

JM: She eventually left the Washington County school system in summer of 2009, right after our 
second son was born. And it was at that time that we finally moved down to Virginia. So I'd been 
running the vineyard in Fauquier County since 2003, full-time since 2005, and driving an hour 
and 20 minutes each way from Maryland. From 2005-2009 and it was unpleasant. So when she 
left because we had two young kids, that was when we moved down here and eliminated my 
commute. And then we landed in Hume, Virginia. And we became entrenched in the wine scene

there in Fauquier County. So her next move is to start utilizing her varied art experiences and 
working with multimedia and doing wine and grape themed artworks and selling those at wine 
festivals. 
[00:19:17] 
#mainstreet #mainstreetshop #arterrawine #site #property #land #acreage #vineyard 
#winemaking 
 
JM: It's a lot of ceramic work, picking leaves from the vineyards, using those leaf impressions to 
make bowls and platters and doing carvings in retired wine barrels and the staves and the heads, 
and framing paintings, etching glass, and all these different things. And she sold work, and I 
would go with her on weekends at wine festivals. And did that for 4-5 years. And constantly the 
customers wanted a more permanent location they could go to get what they wanted when the 
wanted as gifts or for themselves. As opposed it, it's the middle of June, and yeah these might 
make good Christmas presents, but my brain's not there yet. So she had a need for a more 
permanent space and a need to get her studio out of the house because it's kind of tough working 
conditions doing fine arts in the home. So once it was clear that she needed her space. We 
thought about just a main street shop. And then the reality is you got to pull in a whole lotta other 
junk and trinkets to make a go of that, economically. And we figured, well, if we put some wine 
in there, it could go on a wine trail, and cross-market with the wine scene, we could make a little 
bit of wine to do that. And that would make sense and work. And so then we thought about again 
getting like a Victorian house on a main street in a little town and making wine in the basement 
and then having the gallery space and wine sales upstairs. Because I have two growers that I 
worked with all this time since 2005, that grow great fruit. But we have a great relationship that 
was continuing. But then we find real quick that me and Sandy can't make the wine in the 
basement, there was kind of retail type areas, and one thing led to another that what made sense 
to us long term once it became clear that I needed to make a move also, was we took a giant leap 
towards the bigger property in the rural area that was ideal for vineyards, growing more of our 
own fruit at top quality, combining the two into one space, and purchasing it under agricultural 
loan programs as a long-term investment. Essentially cashing out any dollars that we had 
anywhere, and borrowing as many as we could. And having this be our long-term investment 
plan. So the process goes on from there but that was a very long-winded version. [00:21:54] How 
we came to be here. 
KS: So yes we were at, let's see, your first son was born 2005, second one was 2009, and that's 
when you moved to Virginia, to Hume. [JM agrees.] Hume is how far from here? 
JM: 20 minutes south of here. 
[00:22:17] 
 
KS: You're doing the art festivals, she was working, and you wanted to find a little shop front, 
but that wasn't working. So then 2014 was when you…?

JM: Fall going into early winter the end of 2012, was when we wrote the business plan. So it 
took a while for all the pieces to sink to be able to actually, without being a rich person, start a 
wine business, and be able to make the economics work. Once they're up and running, it's not so 
bad. But starting them is horrid. And it took a long time working to find how the economic 
model would click. Really hard. We wrote the business plan with a good model and contracted 
property April of 2013, and worked with the USDA to anchor our loan program with farm 
service agency and they get behind people like us that don't have the economic resources to start 
on your own, but are the right kind of people to do what we're talking about doing, and have a 
good plan. And they got behind that, and that loan process takes a long time. And we finally 
settled on this property in January of 2014. 
[00:23:45] 
KS: And then, started construction quite quickly, then. 
#fauquiercounty #affidavit #farmbuilding #floodplain #environmentalimpact 
 
JM: Yeah, we had to start with the permits run-around which was just in Fauquier County at the 
moment is just an affidavit for the building which says we're putting up farm building here. That 
one was pretty easy. We had to cross the stream at the front and that was a little bit more because 
it was in a flood plain so it needed to be engineer-certified kind of thing. For environmental 
complications. 
[00:24:20] 
KS: For the driveway up to the house. 
#stream #creek #erosion #forest #vineyard #clearing #clearingforest #buildings #construction 
#power #licensing #permits #harvest #winemaking 
 
JM: Just to be able to cross the water to start coming up the hill. And that one took some effort 
and then just the two of those the building plus the stream crossing and the driveway, barn, and 
combined brought the scrutiny of whether or not we needed erosion and sediment-controlled 
plants and all that macro-construction development stuff. Which we just didn't. We came in just 
under that threshold. Which was nice. We disturbed as little as we possibly could because we 
love the forest and we wanted to keep that and they don't have those same land disturbance 
permit implications on the agricultural fields. So we had to remove forest to put in vineyard, that 
didn't happen. So 2014 it probably took us 2 or 3 months to be able to cross the stream and get 
up the hill. And then start clearing and establishing a foundation for the building. So that the 
frame could go up over the summer. And once that was in motion, later summer we started 
clearing for the vineyards, we have two vineyard plots here. And we then by mid-August jumped 
full-speed into enclosing the buildings because they wouldn't allow us to connect power from the 
electric company until the building was at least enclosed. So we rapidly enclosed it enough to 
just you know get it protected from the elements. And got power running and set up the cellar for 
wine-making and went through wine-making in the fall so took a pause for 6-8 weeks during the 
harvest season and then immediately came back to the upstairs after harvest to finish the interior 
of the building. And our business plan, knowing we were going to be well out of money by then, 
had us slated to open at the beginning of February 2015 and to go from the frame going up in 
August which ran a couple months behind schedule going up and pinched us pretty hard. We 
Winery Workers in Virginia

pretty much ran about 7 days a week, 14, 15, 16-hour days straight through that time to get open 
because we had no choice. And we built it again mostly ourselves. So we built it. When you look 
at a wall, a paint, a door, a floorboard, a light, a plumbing fixture. We put it all in. 
[00:26:52] 
KS: When you say "we" was it just you and Sandy, did you have any staff that were helping. 
Friends? 
#carlossosa #carpentry #craftsmanship #framercarpenter #electrical #plumbing 
 
JM: I had a guy that I'd known for a while named Carlos Sosa. And he is an amazing craftsman 
and carpenter and his finishing skills exceed mine. So a lot of the fine-tune finish work he had to 
do, but he also was a great "bang it out" framer carpenter. So it was effectively me and him and 
then one of two assistants helpers along the way. And when he was available, he'd bring in an 
extra guy or two and I'd work with him, and we'd bang out what we could, and when he wasn't 
available, because he does have other work, then I would plow forward on to pieces that I could 
do on my own. So I was more towards mechanical and basic carpentry. I put in all the walls, all 
these doors, all the electrical, plumbing and all that kind of stuff. But worked with him in every 
aspect of it. So when you see the big windows, the chalet-type windows, there was me and him 
going up there by ourselves just the two of us, hoisting these windows way up off the ground, 
which from the outside is, by the time you get to the top, you're probably a good 45-foot drop to 
the ground, and we had our own scaffoldings kind of set up and built out hauling that stuff up 
there. It was a little crazy. [They laugh.] 
[00:28:26] 
KS: This is very high. The space we are in right now sort of feels almost like a church. The 
windows are...how big those are? 
JM: The two big central windows are probably each 6x6? [KS agrees.] They're pretty big. And of 
course those high ones were really high. The highest triangle ones at the top. So we built the 
building of probably half the price of what it would have cost. 
KS: So when you say you did it, you really did it? 
#diy #doityourself 
JM: Yeah, me and another guy, basically. We did more than that. By the time we opened, we had 
built the concrete tables that we're sitting at right now which are craft concrete with leaf 
impressions in them. Sandy and I made those. The initial tables on the patio, we made those from 
old wire reels from electric companies. There's not as many as there was because they're not 
designed for getting rained on constantly like they are right now. So a couple of them have worn 
out over time. We replaced them but we made all those. 
[00:29:42] 
 
KS: Wow I would have thought that you got these from some hipster, you know. 
Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017

JM: That's a table that probably would have cost about $800 a piece that we probably built for 
$35 or something. [He laughs.] 
KS: These are great, the tables we're sitting at right now, and they have sort of almost the 
concrete is made to look sort of like weathered copper or something. It's got like a stain, is it a 
stain you put on it? [He agrees.] They're beautiful. Yeah they're awesome. So you made all of 
these and there's like 20 of them? 
JM: There's 10 in here. 
[00:30:15] 
 
KS: Wow. And so how old are the kids, are they helping out with any of this, or are they still too 
young? 
JM: The older one's 11 now the younger one is 8, and what they do comes and goes. There's 
times when they get real motivated and real helpful, and then there's time when they'd rather just 
do their own thing. Our older son Grayson is at a bit of a transitional point where he really did 
start helping a little bit more over this past summer. Started doing a little bit of work in the 
vineyards, some trellising work, some crop management, and it was really neat to see him 
starting to participate. The younger one is Callan [KS confirms spelling.] and he loves to jump in 
and help but the stamina is not quite there. So he'll participate for a little while and then kinda 
need to go off and go do something else. 
[00:31:18] 
#certification #virginia #winery #sales 
 
KS: So we were talking about how you got it open. So do you need any sort of certification or 
anything in Virginia? What is the process to be able to open a winery and sell that wine to the 
public? 
 
#ttb #virginiaABC #entrepeneur #shenandoahvalley #zoning #license 
 
JM: There's several folds. So we are licensed at the federal level through TTB which I've never 
understand the words to that...Tax Trade Tariff Bureau? It's more Ts than 2 so I've never figured 
out how that works. [KS laughs.] Which used to be ATF. So we get a federal license there. I 
understood that process because I'd done it before. And after you get that license then you apply 
for a state license through Virginia ABC. They won't start their process until their federal license 
is approved but then they come and inspect and they make for that all your doors lock and that 
kind of thing. And that where you say you have your wine is where you have your wine, or going 
to be. And so that's the second inspection. Our story is a little bit classic entrepreneur in that we 
knew we needed to open in 2015 and we make an authentic distinctive Virginia wine we'll talk 
about that process in a minute, but we wanted to open with our own wine. A lot of wineries start 
with somebody else's leftover excess wine that they stick their own label on it and they open the 
doors for cash flow. And, from cash flow point of view, ok cool. But that wasn't our path. We 
wanted to start with our own wines. So we actually in 2013, got our first license to make wine on 
Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017

our residential property and they licensed the shed in the backyard. And so we had to deal with 
ridiculously small-scale. It was like the classic, "we started in the garage." It was one of those. 
And so I had fruit from another grower I had worked with in Shenandoah valley and it was a lot 
of kind of calling in favors and relationships. The whole thing started from relationships. So 
there was trading and consulting for fruit and that kind of stuff going on. So we started in 2013 
without spending any money. And made that first wine at home, legally, under license, and then 
once the building here was ready, got the license here, shut down the license at home, transferred 
that wine here and then crushed the 2014s here. So yes we have a federal license and we have a 
state license and the county then has to just approve that you're in proper zoning. 
[00:34:16] 
Part Two (Second file) 
KS: This is Kim Stryker continuing the interview with Jason Murray of Arterra wines, on 
September 6, 2017 at 1:56 PM and we are continuing to talk about his very first wine that was 
made under the Arterra name in 2014. So sorry, go right ahead. 
 
#bottling 
JM: The first wine license was at our residential property with the 2013s, once we had the license 
established here in 2014, we were able to crush ferment our 2-14s here and had moved over 
2013s and bottled them. To have a pretty quick turnover but start selling wine of our own making 
and our own style in the beginning of 2015. With the intention being that we didn't just want to 
buy somebody else's leftover bulk less-than-ideal wine and stick our name on it. We wanted to 
start with our own authenticity and integrity. 
[00:01:19] 
#growers #grapes #virginiagrapes 
KS: So do you find that when growers, unless they have an exclusive contract with somebody, if 
there are grapes available to buy on the market in Virginia, they're going to be less than prime 
grapes? 
 
#yield #grapeyield #bulkwine #winery. 
JM: No, this isn't necessarily an issue of the grape-growing or the grape-growing quality. that 
can go any which way regardless of doing what it is. there's people that focus and do well and 
there's people who don't and there's people that just want bigger yields and there's people that 
want better quality. And that's just a matter of who it is you're working with and what their focus 
is. A lot of larger places to maintain their flexibility and preserve their quality, if they have the 
economic advantage to do so, will overproduce wine. And then instead of selling the fruit that 
they don't need, from projections, they will make it all into wine and then eventually, once it's 
time to make their blending decisions for bottling, will pick out what are the good pieces that 
they want for their wine and there will be what's left that doesn't make any sense to spend on 
bottles and labels if it's more than they're going to be able to sell. And then you sell that wine as 
"bulk wine" or you bottle it with someone else's label and sell it to them as "bottled wine" they’re 
going to sell in their winery. Just as a basic concept, you have to assume that the winery that 
Winery Workers in Virginia

started this was choosing the best pieces for their image, and they're selling what's not the best. 
So that's why we didn't want to go that way. 
[00:03:13] 
KS: Where were you originally from? 
 
#maryland #glenelg #sykesville 
JM: We both grew up in central Maryland, only about 5-10 minutes apart. I grew up in Glenelg, 
Maryland, and Sandy grew up in Sykesville, Maryland. [00:03:32] [They confirm spelling.] So 
we were pretty close together. We went to the same middle school and high school. And we got 
together senior year of high school. 
[00:04:03] 
 
KS: Did you at that time, when you were kids, getting to know each other, dating, think that you 
would eventually do something like this? Did you have any idea that this was down the road for 
you? 
#livestock #horticulture #goodwine #wine #drinkingwine 
 
JM: No, at that time I was still really thinking about livestock. Or, when I went into school for 
horticulture, eventually, was based on the Maryland horticulture industry, more focused on 
greenhouses and nurseries. And no at the point in time we had no idea. The only thing we had at 
that point in time was Sandy's stepmother Kathy, liked to drink good wine. [KS laughs.] 
[00:04:47] 
 
KS: So you were exposed to, kind of, but there was wine around, or somebody was enjoying 
wine and talking about wine in your midst. 
 
JM: That there is a difference between good wine and not good wine. 
 
KS: So that was probably your first experience, probably in high school, she’d be enjoying some 
wine. 
 
JM: Yeah. Just exposure. 
[00:05:23] 
#winemaking #wineries 
 
KS: In preparation for this as your career was evolving and you were closer and closer to this 
being the model of winemaking and having the facility here where you could do the studio as 
Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017

well, did you visit other wineries to get any perspective on how they were doing things? Or did 
you just have a very clear idea of how you wanted to do it, or you and Sandy wanted to do it? 
#tastingrooms #land 
 
JM: To develop our place, we really have a pretty strong philosophy behind our crafts and the 
way that we approach the entire project is based on that. So that is one of the biggest things to 
explain as the overriding philosophy here. With that pretty well defined, you approach the type 
customers that you connect with, why that piece of land was chosen. So, we had some exposure 
to other wineries and tasting rooms and so forth, but the last thing you want to do, in my opinion, 
is just recreate what other people are doing. There's things to learn from in terms of like basic 
process flows or customer flows, but overall you need to have your own identity. And that's what 
I think we were pretty well established. 
[00:06:53] 
 
KS: What have been some of the surprises to getting this project off the ground, maybe things 
that you didn't anticipate. 
 
#virginia #virginiawine #virginiawineries #boom 
JM: The biggest shocker was after we opened. So I had opened another winery who had 
somebody else working for it. It was 2006. And 2006 when we opened, and that's when a lot of 
wineries started to open. The first, the beginning of the wave started to hit. When that opened, 
there was 85 86 wineries in Virginia. And then over the 9 year span up until when we opened, 
and I had worked for one place and was seeing it mostly from the inside, because you're too busy 
to get out a lot. By the time we opened there was 285 wineries in Virginia. So it hit a phase 
where the number of wineries the growth of the number of wineries has outpaced the growth of 
the winery customers. So competition is kind of a tricky word in this business. Because I don't 
really feel like my neighbors are my competition. I feel like my neighbors are an asset and a 
resource because customer goes to 1, 2, 3, 4 places, and as long as they have a good experience 
and they really enjoy at last one of them, then more customers come to the region. So I don't 
consider my direct neighbors an issue in that regard. But just the sheer number of wineries and 
some of the regions with monumental funding for marketing, and some of the individual 
wineries with monumental marketing for funding, and the trend towards more wineries moving 
closer in to the public, means that by the time you actually select a site that is truly ideal in terms 
of elevation and soils, for producing the best quality wine you can produce, your own like the far 
side of hell. From when we opened in 2015, I was shocked at how challenging it is to get people 
to show up. Compared to what it was like for wineries opening 8 or 9 years ago. When you open 
the door, it seemed like the people just walked in. 
[00:09:22] 
KS: So maybe some of the novelty of it or there's was just so much competition for people to go 
and maybe some are closer to their homes.

JM: It's a cultural phenomenon and I don't want to cast this in a negative light, because again I 
think there's a positivity to be found in this. But the bigger wineries that are closer to the 
highway closer in, with far higher investment, and far larger marketing campaigns, catch the 
masses of people, the masses of people this is tricky to say. but a lot of people--there's two sides 
to the wine industry. One of it is just enjoying yourself, and the other side is the wine. And a lot 
of people for good reason want to just go enjoy themselves. Perfectly good. Whether it's 
something to do other than going to the mall or going to a coffee shop, or talking a walk in a 
park, you go hang out at the winery. You take your kids, they run around. You take your dog, 
you do whatever it is. And there's a lot of people that their primary interest is just get out of the 
house, go down the road, it's convenient to get to, all my buddies can meet up here because it's 
not that far from everybody, and they all pile in these places that are closer. And there's nothing 
wrong with these places. But it takes the customer that really is focused on wine or integrity and 
quality of the product as the focus of the winery. To get to those people to take that extra step 
further. And I'm not trying to say that some of these bigger places closer in are inferior in any 
way, but we connect with a different clientele. And the big wineries act as, in a way, a filter, that 
get tremendous more people. And so then we get tremendously less people but we do a better job 
of getting the type of people that connect with our philosophy and then appreciate that we are a 
little quieter and not so overrun. So it's a tricky thing in Virginia. 
[00:11:37] 
 
#wealth #money #jeffwhite #glenmanorvineyards #glenmanor 
JM: One of the issues in my mind in the industry is that a lot of wealth, a lot of the wineries are 
owned by wealth. Second careers, retired wealth. We have none. It's hard to compete with 
wineries that want to be big and cool and offer deep discounts and spend tons of money, and the 
place is huge and flashy, and everything’s great, and there isn't necessarily the profitability in 
some of those. At least recouping your investment. And if the motive isn't true profit and they 
can give away a lot more, and spend a lot more, and we can't. So it's really hard to enter this 
industry as little guys. The wineries that are doing this are nailing the bigger market and they're 
doing it really well. It just makes it harder for the little guy on the outside. To establish. So the 
roundabout story is that what is required in this industry I think if you're going to make it at least 
economically, Arterra is testing the model as to whether or not, as a non-wealthy person, you can 
make it in this industry. And I got to tell you, I don't recommend it. [They laugh.] It has not been 
easy, it has not been fun. The common question is "are you so excited you're living the dream?" 
It's like, "yeah there's great things about this, but the amount of background residual stress in 
getting this thing going is phenomenal. The original question was what was the hard thing or the 
scary thing, it was getting it going. What was a slower start, has turned into a stronger foundation 
and a much more ideal place of growth. So, I asked Jeff White at Glen Manor Vineyards, 
because he's a high-quality place that's out there. You know, what do you think of site location? 
He said, “don't be on the big roads because if you want that nicer crowd of people that are 
focused on quality, then make them have to search you out. Where they have to search you out 
and takes them longer to get to you.” And so we see a delay of 9 months to a year and a half 
from when people hear about you to when they show up at your door. and then they do and they 
tell all their buddies that it was great, then another big lag until those people show up. …So we're 
circling to philosophy…

#spontaneousfermentation #fermentation 
JM: We started the whole business on the philosophy of craftsmanship, authenticity and 
integrity. And it comes from both sides. And there's a second version of this that I'll point out in 
a minute. But Sandy's artwork has always been this. There's always been a nature basis to it. A 
connection to the earth. A connection to nature. It is not replicated works. And she puts herself 
through much more challenging processes. In order to have something that really resonates 
authenticity and integrity. So she uses a lot of the leaves from the vineyards. A lot of people say 
well why don't you just get a mold and you could reproduce these. Well then, now. She wants 
each leaf or each bowl to be an individual leaf from the vineyard or from the forest. It's harder, 
so you have to pick the leaves, you have to cut them out, you have to make each one, and then 
assemble them all, and its extra effort. But the pieces are amazing. So they say, well why don't 
you bring in a bunch of little minions, and have them just make these things like crazy and train 
them, and then you could have a whole bunch more. She's like, “but then I didn't make it." She 
said the whole point is that this is my work, a piece of me in every artwork. So she approaches it 
from that philosophy. The wine philosophy is a big concept, because this brings into light some 
micro and some macro concepts. There are a few wineries, one or two maybe, in any region, that 
kind of go the way we go. Likely more in Europe. But what we do is foremost we're focused on 
quality fruit from the site. And then we do native-yeast fermentations. Which is also known as 
indigenous yeast, wild yeast, uninoculated, all these different terms mean the same thing. We 
don't add yeast. The wine ferments from the yeast that's on the grapes' skins. So that means that 
that yeast is in our Virginia vineyard, on our Virginia fruit, comes in with that fruit, and every 
one of our fermentations starts spontaneously from that yeast. So it's a second tier--it's a 
spontaneous yeast fermentation. Some people will get the first one started, and there's a 
succession of 6 or 7 different yeasts so they'll have time from alcohol tolerance and temperature 
tolerance and the ones in the middle are faster and stronger, and once those get going, they'll 
grab that and they'll use that to re-inoculate each subsequent fermentation. So that could still be 
indigenous but it's not spontaneous. And we get a huge attribute to the wine style from the 
spontaneous early naturally starting yeast. It's way harder, the fermentations start way slower, 
they finish way slower, the dynamics of it are different, the aging, the evolution of the wine is 
different, it takes very focused attention to the wines every day during fermentation and then it 
takes a lot of patience to get them where they need to be.

KS: Is this anything to do with biodynamic farming? 
JM: That is an excellent question. I have a lot of exposure to biodynamics and organic 
philosophies and we are not operating organically or biodynamically. Biodynamics, takes into 
account--the easiest way to describe it is two main concepts. 1 is the celestial cycles so that's 
moons and suns and constellations and where those energies are flowing and moving and as to 
Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017

what days of the month you would conduct which activities. That's one kind of phase of it. The 
other one easiest way for me to convey it is, it's homeopathic remedies for plants, for agriculture. 
So there is different treatments that are done, that are then applied to the fields to then 
energetically energize different aspects of the crops. And it's different depending on which crops 
you're growing, and what your region is. It's a strong philosophy that rules out a lot of bad things. 
Just like organic rules out conceptually a lot of the bad things. We’re not quite organic here 
because there's a disease that's really prevalent from Central Pennsylvania through North 
Carolina called Black Rot that exists in New York and Ontario but with the cooler climate up 
there isn't a big deal. The disease as far as I know, isn't really prevalent anywhere else in the 
world. Maybe I'm making that up. but this is what I understand. And it's really focused in this 
region and we haven't found the organic management for it and it is a disease that really focuses 
when the vines are flowering in early June, late may, and if you don’t treat that, then 3 or 4 
weeks later as the berries are starting to grow, they all shrivel up into little black raisins. And you 
lose 80-85-90% of the crop. And I've seen people that had resources and put forth incredible 
effort into controlling this organically and it didn't work. And one that I highly commend for the 
effort that went in would be Black Ankle vineyard in Maryland. That guy's name is Ed Boyce. 
And if there's somebody that put in effort to see if you could grow European vinifera grapes 
organically and you know that land. That guy tried as hard as you can try. So there was a lot to 
be learned there.

#nativeyeastfermentations #wine #redwine #winelabeling #organics #chemicals #additives 
 
JM: So you've got to learn from other people sometimes. He was b-good to learn from. The 
lesson learned was we don't quite have block rot beat. Everybody thinks you can't do organic 
here because it's hot and humid in the summertime. That's really not that bad. We've got two 
diseases called powdery mildew and downy mildew, and we got pretty darn good organic 
options for controlling that kind of stuff. So I went with a program after bloom, so when the 
berries are set, that we did organic spray program with one exception. And I put in phosphite, 
which is known to be benign in terms -of plant and animal well-being, human well-being. It is 
known to be benign, but because it isn't a naturally-occurring whatever it is, compound, and then 
it can have evidence of persistence, and it doesn't fit the philosophy of the organic program. But 
if used properly and properly time, either dissipates or isn't really in the fruit, or is nothing that's 
going to impact humans. So what we did as a philosophy was because we do these native yeast 
fermentations, we want to know that the fruit is clean and healthy, nothing chemical-wise on it. 
Because we do drink our wine and we enjoy it. And we want to know that what we're drinking is 
the equivalent of probiotic and healthy. And so when they say red wine is good for you, well red 
wine can be good for you, but I would question most red wines out there that are mass-produced 
as far as what's in there. Because there has been a huge fight from the wine industry to prevent 
ingredients labeling on wine. Because there's more in there than you want to know. And we don't 
do any of that stuff.

#tannin #manipulation #grape #climate #redwine #californiawine #virginiawine #yeast 
#nativeyeast 
 
JM: So we pick clean fruit that doesn't have bad nasty residual chemicals on it. And in theory 
we could stop when the chemical said stop this one 2 weeks ahead, stop this one 6 weeks ahead, 
or whatever they are. But I push the limit a little extra hard and I just say well by the time there's 
a little grape there, we should stop spraying it with that bad stuff, because we can use the more 
organic-minded stuff and fruit's clean. Healthy. So then we get it into the cellar. We do this 
natural fermentation. Then we don't have any of the cellar chemicals and additives that people 
are doing. So we don't use enzymes to break down skins or increase juice yield which produces 
bitterness, which then needs to be fined with fining agents which is a really friendly term in the 
industry for chemicals. And we aren't using any tannin or additions or manipulations and all this 
crazy stuff. Instead, we don't do anything that was going to change the character of the wine or 
the grape as it grew in our climate. So we don't take our reds and crush them and then separate 
off a percentage of the juice, which would make rose, but we concentrate your red so that you 
have a bolder red in Virginia. Pretty similar to a bold red from California. We're not trying to 
recreate anything anywhere else but we're trying to use as minimalist processes as possible to say 
this is Virginia style wine. So if you took all the process steps out, and manipulations out, at the 
core, this is what true Virginia wine is. A grape from Virginia, a yeast that's on that grape's skin, 
none of these additions and manipulations.

#badgrapes #goodwine #goodgrapes #stainlesssteel #bottling #agingwines #oxygenation 
#oxygen #redwine #shelflife #sulfite 
 
JM: I understand that, in the wine world, wine-making is the art of what the wine-maker does to 
make bad grapes into good wine. OK, cool, fine, if you're starting with bad grapes. We start with 
good grapes. That's our main premise. The only thing that ever touches our wine is a minimum 
amount of sulfite and that is because we are making aging wines, and just the process of moving 
them to get them ready for bottling and into the bottle, they pick up enough oxygen to where 
they would have a drastically reduced shelf life. You could make a wine without sulfites I think 
if you just kept it in stainless steel, bottled it really young, never let it get exposed to air, and 
some of the things that make great red wines great red wines, is that bit of exposure to air. And 
you'd be making a bit of a different wine if you did that, but you could do it. 
[00:24:46] 
#screwcaps #corks #stelvin #tin #price #cost 
 
JM: Instead, a second adaptation we've done is we've switched over to screwcaps, we use 
Stelvin, and we use Stelvin with a tin liner. And that is a screwcap that does not let air in. And 
there's a couple reasons for this. First, the switch was for quality control. Because corks are 
getting horribly inconsistent for aging wines. After a few years, bottles start to show different, 5- 
10 years you're losing bottles. A customer buys a $40 bottle of wine, some people take that home 
and drink it that night because that's their cheap wine with pizza. Some people save that for 3 
Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017

more years until they're fortieth wedding anniversary. And that's their special wine. And my 
issue was that bottle of wine needs to be good when that person drinks it. No matter what. Can't 
have the bottle you bought turn out to be the bad one. And as a wine-maker working with corks, 
if I had a bad bottle I'd run back down in the basement and grab another one and say "oh, it's not 
the whole lot that's gone bad, it's just that bottle." But that's not acceptable for somebody who's 
paying their money for a bottle to gamble on whether or not it's going to be a good bottle of wine 
because it was bottled with a cork. So then for aging wines, you put extra sulfite in so that as 
oxygen's coming through the cork over time, the sulfite is mitigating that oxygen and preserving 
the wine longer term as an antioxidant. That's the way I use sulfite, as an antioxidant. I don't need 
to put that extra sulfite in, because I don't have that extra air coming in over time. All I need to 
do is make the transfer into the bottle, it's sealed up tight, and it's done. 
[00:26:30] 
#technology #newworld #oldworld #winemaking 
 
JM: So we are using as low of sulfite levels, as far as I know, as has been ever heard of or tried 
or intelligently used for an aging wine. We are at rock bottom bare-minimums, where most of 
my colleagues are like, "you can't go lower than that. Don't do it, you're already pushing it." But 
it's worth it. And it's working because there's a modern technology, there's a new closure that lets 
us protect, and we also have the advantage of nitrogen and carbon dioxide tents. We do use 
modern wine-making practices that allow us to not use all these other additives and tricks and 
techniques. So we're a really interesting process because we’re actually one of few places I know 
that is intentionally combining and trying to gain the best of what is referred to as old world and 
new world wine-making. 
[00:27:28] 
#yeast #nativeyeastfermentations #oxidation #oxygen #oxygenexposure #cork #whitewine 
#palate #complex #depth #aroma #flavor 
 
JM: Old world wine-making was these native yeast fermentations. Before the 70s there was no 
yeast to be had. So things would start slower, they would pick up more oxygen, or some old 
world wine-making the way I understand it would be that you get a lot of oxygen into the juice, 
you blow through that juice in subsequent wines oxidative capacity, so that further down the line 
after bottling, the wine isn't going to change, it isn't going to further degrade from oxygen 
exposure, cork or not whatever it is. You've gotten past that. The juice gets all like white wines it 
gets all turned brown from all this air, the brown drops out, you ferment, on you go. You get this 
really round, broad palate, complexity, depth, interesting characteristics in the wine, but you've 
lost the vivid fresh fruit aromas and flavors. 
[00:28:24] 
#fruit #fruitcharacteristics #winecomplexity #grapes #yeast #floralflavor #californiawines

JM: So old world wine tends to have subdued fruit characteristics, but has great complexity. New 
world is easiest explained as these yeast additions, and yeast additions, right after you pick or 
Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017

press those grapes, you throw in a huge hit of yeast, takes off like a shot, there is no time for any 
of this oxidation to occur, and the wine's preserved this really vivid fruit floral flavors and 
characters. And so best I can understand, that's why I like California, "oh they're this big fruit- 
bombs" which I don't really understand because I don't get a lot of fruity flavors out of California 
wines compared to our wines, but because it's that vivid, purpley character freshness, that's new 
world. But the wines are more linear, streamlined, simple. They don't have roundness, they don't 
have depth, they don't have this complexity of character. They're very repeatable, they're very 
fast, they're very controlled, and then you start to do all these other wine-maker techniques to try 
and make up for those things. 
[00:29:36] 
#oak #tannin #additives #concentrations #bleedoffs #sugar #drywine #nativeyeast #headspace

JM: Then oak comes in, tannin additions, and the bleed-offs, and the concentrations, and all this 
stuff goes on. and a lot of sugar, there's a lot of sugar in dry wines, especially red wines, that you 
can't perceive up to about .7%, but gives a wine this artificially inflated volume. Our wines are 
dry, dry, and have this volume from their native yeast process, but we capture the best of the new 
world by using oxygen avoidance practices, such as head space protection, with nitrogen or 
carbon dioxide, and we don't have the oxidated degradation, so while our fermentations start 
really slow, they're protected. They finish slow. But we protect them. We bottle them protected 
and you would think, "oh this means once you open the bottle it's going to go bad in minutes." It 
doesn't. At all. Quite the opposite, they open up beautifully over 45 minutes, and hour, 2 hours, 3 
hours, and if they're actually intentionally handled properly, can be really nice even the next day. 
They get better and better and better as they breathe. To a point. Only overnight if you actually 
intentionally keep it in a sealed-up smaller container. 
[00:30:58] 
#newworld #oldword #virginiawine #virginiagrapes #indigestion #acidreflux #headaches 
#heartburn #astringent #bitter #oak #overoaked 
 
JM: But we capture the best of the new world flavor-wise, with the best of the old world with 
this native yeast depth, complexity of character that we get. What we don't have is all the new 
oak. So in order to capture Virginia, fruit character, grape character, is all older oak barrels so if 
you aren't ready for wine like ours, and all you're used to is over-oaked wines from the grocery 
store, you're going to think something's missing in our wine. But if you're tired of tasting those 
wines that are just oak because the fruit wasn't really good in the first place, it's got these 
astringencies and bitterness as they finish, from unripe tannins, tannin additions, other chemicals, 
manipulations and tweaks, and you find that I don't really like red wine, but then you try ours, 
the amount of people that never drink red wine but are hooked on our wine is unbelievable. And 
the amount of people that say "yours are the first wines that don't give me headaches." Don't give 
the indigestion or reflux, or heartburn, these kind of things. We have an ever-increasing list of 
people that say, the more that we drink your wine, the less we drink anything else. Because the 
cleanness of how these wines are made starts to reveal the things that you took for granted and 
didn't notice but now do that you don't enjoy about other wines.

#americanfoodsystem #us #america #strawberry #flavor #taste #organic #palate 
 
JM: I say this as a small and big concept, this is a reflection of the American food system. So we 
are that equivalent of that little guy organic-y producer out there, which again, we're not organic, 
but we're going to pay extra for strawberry that was organic and tastes phenomenal, or you're 
going to say what's the difference and you're going to buy the cheap regular strawberry. It's your 
choice. And some people are happy one way, and some people want to go the other way. We're 
going to capture the people that really can dial in on what it is that they're putting in their body, 
have some more typically developed palate, not meaning you're older, but you've been drinking 
wine long enough to actually know what you're tasting. And kind of discern. So we have a wine 
that has great depth, complexity, character, a lot of different features going on into it, but it's not 
a cookie-cutter wine. So some people aren't ready for it. And if you're not ready for it, you can 
easily overlook what's going on in your wine. 
[00:33:29] 
#wabisabit #philosophy #nature #authenticity 
 
JM: So that was again horribly long answer for the philosophy behind our place, and we produce 
as natural and authentic a product as we can. And so we are set in a forest that is undisturbed as 
we could keep it, is a building that is as natural-based as we could produce, made ourselves, and 
further wrapped this up, when people want to understand our philosophy, Sandy put a term on 
the wall above the kiln wabi-sabi which, when she found it, noticed it captured our concept. It is 
a traditional or heritage Japanese term and it's defined by these three statements we have on our 
wall above our patio door windows, and they are seeing beauty in impermanence, transience, and 
non-perfection, reverence for authenticity and earthiness and appreciation for the genuine 
integrity of natural objects and processes. So what this says is the way that nature does it, is 
what's best. So we try to make wine as much as possible according to how nature makes it. So I 
don't define myself as a wine-maker because I don't make the wine. I have an environment for 
the wine to evolve itself. So it's a lot more of a "keep an eye that things don't go really wrong, 
but let it be." 
[00:35:16] 
KS: Wow. When you were choosing this site, how many acres are here? 
#acreage #site #land #vineyard #property #arterra 
JM: The property is 75 acres, which is way bigger than we wanted, but was the right piece. And 
most of it is still fully wooded. We have 2 vineyard blocks that total about 8 acres right now. So 
the one right by the tasting room is the smaller one. And then the biggest continuous plantable 
area was a hill across the back of the property, and that's where the rest of it is.

KS: when you were clearing the land, did you find a lot of apple trees back in here from when it 
was previously different things, or remnants of apple trees? 
 
#dccorridor #washingtondc #dc #fruit #train #hickorytrees #poplartrees 
 
JM: The apple trees on this property are gone, but it was a big point, because this entire area set 
of hills was apple trees through the early 1900s is what I was told or understand. When this was 
the supply area for the DC corridor. And I think things changed because these are low- 
productivity but high-quality soils, and so you don't get as much fruit, it's more expensive to 
grow fruit here, whereas there's other areas where they're higher productivity but maybe lower 
quality. But they could produce a cheap, bring it in on the train, and undercut. And there was a 
point in time at which the American system started to cater towards lower-cost food as opposed 
to higher quality food, and I think a portion of the population is starting to circle back on that 
one. But this got let go. And basically, the forest that we're in now was cut once around 1990 and 
that was the big trees that were here, amongst the first regrowth from the orchard. So most of 
what grew on this property was poplar on the front half, and hickory in the back. 
[00:37:23] 
#fieldpoplar #mountainpoplar #clearingforest #forest 
 
JM: So I guess these are two species that come in pretty fast and strong. And the poplar we had a 
mix, when we cleared the field, of what are called Field Poplar and Mountain Poplar, and that's 
basically the logger terms. The sawmill terms. And so Field Poplar is what grew when it was 
converting from a field or the orchard back to forest. And because it was pretty open, they grow 
a lot of branches. that's why they have a lot of knots, all the way up and down them, and you can 
see them, not while it's wet and rainy right now, but they sort of look like little kitty-cat faces 
where all the branches came off of the poplars. And it's like a bunch of black spots. About every 
foot or so apart going up the trees. So that's a low-dollar poplar. 
[00:38:13] 
And then we have some which is what was probably mostly cut during the 1990s, was Mountain 
Poplar which was in the second growth. Which are the ones that shoot up straight without the 
branches, because they're trying to reach up and get the sunlight. So I think what would happen 
was there wouldn't have been a whole lot of time difference between the two, but the ones that 
are the Mountain Poplar would have been a few years later came in, and just shot up to out- 
compete the others and then [unintelligible.] But there's no apples left. But this was the forest as 
it regrew from the orchards.

KS: OK. And so did you do soil testing or was there anything, you hear about the minerality in 
the soil here because there's a lot of granite in this area? 
JM: We soil tested and did and didn't do some things to the soil. We put some lime on because 
the main issue was from being forested, really acidic soils. So real low pH and that's hard for the 
vines. So we put some lime on it first, and then maybe we put more on. And that takes some time 
to work down into the soils. And other than that, they were basically a little bit phosphorous- 
deficient in our front field. After that, really not so bad, and grapes are pretty efficient at getting 
what they need. But then there's another dichotomy in philosophies in the industry and one of 
them is, it's got to look beautiful, and it's got to look like a golf course, so when they come in and 
they deep rip down to 2 and half feet, brings all the rocks up, they go through and pick up all the 
rocks, get all the rocks out of the field, disc it, smooth it, get it all looking like a golf course and 
then you stick your vines in. and the rocks are really good for long-term for, they decompose, 
and they put more nutrients elemental nutrients back into the soil. And they're really good for 
drainage and quality. 
[00:40:29] 
#clearing #raking #plowing #vines #roots #soil #perennials #annuals #vegetables #wheat #crops 
#fertilizer #seeds 
JM: We did the opposite, which is we cleared it, and ran a rake over it to get the sticks off, and 
didn't touch anything. It takes longer for our lime to work its way down into the soil than if you 
had plowed it in real deep. So our vines, depending on where they are in the fields, have grown a 
little bit slower, younger, in response to the conditions are a little rougher, and the field's a little 
bumpier, and we approached it with the minimum intervention philosophy that, in the long term, 
it's a healthier, better soil, and the vines will do better. And produce better. And they have to 
search their roots a little deeper and longer to find what they need, and they might, some of them 
take an extra year to get where they need to go. But if you come in and you greatly disturb the 
soil, I feel that it's a mistake for long-term permanent perennial crop production system. It's great 
for annuals, is where this comes from, so whether it's vegetables or wheat or corn or whatever, 
you fluff up the soil, it's got a lot of air in it, you plant your seeds, there's seeds root out really 
fast and easy, they grow fast, they set their crop, great crop, bang-done, you do it again the next 
year and you throw on your fertilizer and you pile it up and fluff it up every year and you get 
your crop in and out. It works really good. 
[00:41:59] 
#oxygen #nutrients #longterm #shortterm #soil #clay #dirt #rain #climate #virginia 
 
JM: The vines will grow the same: really good, really fast, really strong that first year if not two, 
maybe three. And they're like "whoa this is great! Soil's loose, fluffy, nutrients are all here, 
everything's fine so they don't root out real far because the nutrients are there" and they're putting 
all this fertilizer in. And they got everything they need and there's good oxygen and good 
nutrients, and they're super happy. And then after a few years with our rain that we get out here, 
and the clay that we have as a component in our soil, the soils start to settle and compact. And if 
you take dirt, we did this in agronomy class in college, and you put it in a jar of water and you 
swirl it all around, and it's all fluffed up, and that's really nice, and then you come back the next 
day and it's this packed at the bottom. And then you come back a week later and it's a tighter 
pack at the bottom, and month later it's a dense pack at the bottom.

#vines #roots #rootsystems #leaves #winter #virginiawinters #altitude 
 
JM: And the vineyard soil does the same thing. If you fluffed it up like that, it packs tighter and 
tighter and tighter over time until there's no oxygen getting through that soil. You retain 
tremendous amounts of moisture and are soggy, or are bone-dry and super hard. They get really 
dense, the vines can't root out in them, they struggle, and then they become, because they have 
limited root systems, even if you are giving them fertilizer to grow green leaves, the root systems 
are limited, and when our cold, hard winters hit every so often, those vines start dying. And 
you'll see a lot of vineyards in Virginia that have seen a lot of turnover. Lower sites are worse, 
and the cold pockets, it's more of an issue than a little bit higher sites like ours. But I have seen 
vineyards on lower or worse sites that were planted with minimum soil disturbance and the vines 
have done a lot better than better sites planted with extreme soil disturbance. because long-term 
it's not good for their roots. We're minimalist on all fronts, which sometimes makes it harder in 
the beginning, but is planned to be better in the long run. 
[00:44:18] 
#harvest #grapes #grapevarieties 
 
KS: So right now, a lot of folks are doing harvest, this is sort of harvest time. [JM agrees.] So 
what kind of grapes are you growing?

#sauvignonblanc #riesling #coolclimate #hotclimate #summerheat 
 
JM: At this property, we have three main grapes: Tannat, Petit Verdot, and cabernet sauvignon 
which I like for blending, not as a primary varietal in Virginia. But it needs to be on a good site, 
so this is a good site. Cab Sauv doesn't do well on poor wet sites in Virginia. Its good sites. We 
have some here. And then I have smaller amounts of Petit Syrah, Chenin Blanc, and Roussane, 
on the other sites that I work with, which is a Seven Oaks vineyard, not Seven Oaks winery, 
which has come along. But Seven Oaks vineyard is in Philomont, between Middleburg and 
Purcellville and that's by Mark and Madeline Skinner, I've been with them for I think its 12 
years, and they're amazing people that helped us a lot getting Arterra going, still do. Their site 
has all of the Chardonnay, all of the Cab Franc, and all of the Malbec, and then also Petit Verdot 
and Tannat. So we tried a couple different whites because I'm looking for whites that get out of 
the summer heat, and Chardonnay works great in Virginia. And after that I think we're too hot 
for most whites. Most of the whites like a cooler climate, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, a lot of 
things like cooler conditions. We're hot, and a lot of the white grapes that like hot and still 
maintain their quality, like Italian-style stuff, and they just die in our winters. So we're a 
conundrum, I think, for whites, even though there's a lot of white wines in Virginia.

#Viognier #VirginiaViognier #yield #moisture #rain #drainage 
 
KS: What about the Viognier? 
JM: Viognier does really good in some places, really not at others. It seems to be really 
susceptible to moisture as a limitation of crop potential. On really dry really well-drained sites it 
seems to work really good, sets good fruit, and it's nice quality. On sites that hold a little bit more 
moisture, it doesn't set crop. Pathetically low yields, and I would wager that there's as much 
Viognier been pulled out of the ground in Virginia as there is still in the ground. 
[00:46:40] 
KS: That was sort of the signature white of Virginia for a while, it seemed like. 
 
#longisland #newyork #bedellcellars #alberino #chrysalis #redwine #whitewine #grapes 
#grapevarities #harvest #october #vines #virginiawine #californiawine #bigred #tannins 
 
JM: It’s got a zippy name, Virginia Viognier. I pulled it out and after having pulled it out from 
extreme frustration, I'm just not willing to take the chance on it. We're going to try, I think in a 
couple years, when we can open up the next hill which would connect our two vineyards, we're 
going to try and put in Alberino. We've seen some nice things from that, Chrysalis has that, we 
just had a nice blend of it from up on Long Island at the Bedell cellars, there seems to be some 
luck with that, and we might go towards blending whites, because other than Chardonnay I have 
a hard time finding a single white that I can really blend with. Reds we've got a great program 
between Cab Franc, Petit Verdot, Tannat, those three grapes are really strong. [They confirm 
spelling of Tannat.] It's not a grape for everybody, because it ripens really, really late. So we 
typically pick it right at the end of October, and that's only if we cut the crops in, vines balance, 
everything you can do to keep ripening advanced. So it's really late, and if it doesn't ripen 
properly it's tart and rough with tannins. But if it's ripe with tannins, it makes an amazing, big, 
bold, rich, full-bodied, dense wine. People think you can't make it, that big red in Virginia. That 
makes the big red. It hangs with big Italians, the big Californias, all of it. It's a big, bold red. 
[00:48:17] 
#cold #coldhardiness #vines #grapes #loudoncounty #winter #tannat #petidperdot #blend 
#barrels #bleedoff #concentration #manipulation 
 
JM: The other catch to it, the reason there isn't much of it, is it is borderline for our area for cold- 
hardiness. So a lot of us, and I had it in Loudon, on lower sites, so 2014 and 2015 winters were 
hard, and below about 650 feet in this area, you sorted out what could handle that elevation and 
what couldn't. and Tannat below 650 feet in this Northern Virginia area doesn't work. You get a 
cold-cold winter, it will just die. So you have to put it on higher ground. So we have it on the 
higher parts of both of our fields here. We're up around 850 feet should do a lot better. So there's 
not that much Tannat in Virginia. There never will be. But it makes an impressive red wine. Oh, 
Winery Workers in Virginia

I love Petit Perdot, also, in blends but it's just big in a way that nothing else is. Without barrels 
and all that bleed-off concentration manipulation stuff... 
[00:49:20] 
 
KS: Well since you're' not doing that stuff, maybe that's another reason why you need to have a 
grape like that that can deliver for you. 
 
#boldwine #cabernetfranc 
JM: And that's part of what we do is we embrace it. Each grape and each variety is different, so 
Cab Franc at its natural balance is more medium-weight, not as bold. And then Petit Verdot gets 
bigger and Tannat gets bigger, and we have wines that can span the spectrum, so we don't feel 
the need to have every one need to be the bold wine, or manufacture whatever. Let Franc be a 
little bit lighter, because the Tannat is bigger.

#harvest #labor #staff #employees 
 
KS: When you have to bring in the harvest, who works here generally? 
#SevenOaksVineyard #yearroundcrew #pickingfruit #maintenace #handwork #vineyard 
JM: On the production side, mainstay is me and Joaquin. And then at the Seven Oaks vineyard 
there's one other guy over there who pretty much is out in the vineyard all the time. But Joaquin 
is the guy whose hands are in the vineyard all the time. He was in here with us this morning 
because it's raining. He might be out in the rain right now, but we'll see how it goes. He does 
most of the handwork at this point, because I just don't have the hours to do the handwork. And 
so instead of bringing in a crew of 10 or 15 people and they sweep through the vineyard every 3 
or 4 weeks, in one day, instead we figured out up to about 8 or 9 acres, how to have one person 
that we are attentive to our timing, just keep circling through the vineyard over and over and over 
and over and over again. Every vine is handled exactly right and consistently every year. and it 
works really well. The only time that we bring in help is for picking. Because we are hand- 
picked. And so, since we are small, and we pick an acre at a time here, we try and find, 
depending on which block it is, and how much fruit there is, 2-4 more people to come in for the 
day. And help pick fruit.

JM: I do mowing, spraying, he does handwork, he helps with crush, so when we're actually 
pressing or destemming/crushing, he'll help with that physical work. But when it comes to actual 
Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017

wine management, fermentation, aging, racking, I'm the only one who does any of that. And he'll 
help with bottling. And aside from him and Sandy, we have some help in the tasting room 
Saturdays and Sundays, and some Friday-Saturday-Sunday. And some of those people help out 
when we need it too. So when we need extra hands bottling, whatever it's going to be, they want 
to learn, participate and know more. So we tend to work with them. We don't really do 
volunteers because they don't realize how hard the work typically is, and we go at things with a 
"get the job done" mentality and if somebody's not on that page it's more effort than it's 
worth. [00:52:22] 
KS: But that is something that other wineries do, they bring in quote unquote volunteers, and 
have them bring in the whole shelf. 
JM: I've been with Joaquin since 2006, so life has kind of evolved to both of us together again, 
and we're great friends, like a brother. 
KS: He's an employee year-round? [JM agrees.] 
JM: And both of us would rather work harder than have other people in the way.

KS: OK. And then so who comes up with the design for your logo, your labels, do you have 
somebody do that, is that something Sandy does. 
 
#GKV #PR #Baltimore #maryland #brandconcepts 
 
JM: The basic concept is all things aesthetic are Sandy's department. I am not an aesthetic- 
minded person. I am a very practical kind of person. So I can get things done, I can get things 
made, I can do things. But when it has to look nice, Sandy figures it out and then decides. And so 
a lot of the character of the entire environment and presentation is Sandy. And she for our labels 
and logo, like the brand imagery, we worked with GKV, which is her father's I would call it a 
branding firm or a PR firm. In Baltimore. And that's his business. And they're not the biggest 
firm, but they are a high quality firm. So we came up with all our brand concepts and worked 
with them to develop the actual labels and logo type stuff.

one local products store. Locally. But those are mostly relationships, give-and-take kind of stuff. 
Locally. We are not a production-model to where distribution economics work. Virginia is 
ridiculously expensive, so it's hard to compete on distribution. You can't compete on price if we 
distribute into stores and restaurants, at least not with the quality perspective that we're doing. 
For example, right now, we have our outer gear fence we had to put up, we just put up an inner 
electric fence for bears and raccoons to keep them off, we bird-netted about half the vineyard to 
keep birds off of that. We just put up streamers in the rest of the vineyard to keep birds off of 
that, and now the turkeys are flying over all of it and eating the grapes [KS laughs] and again we 
have a constant flow of handwork in the vineyard because we have this rain, we have this 
humidity, and it's a hard area to grow fruit. 
[00:56:03] 
#spain #spanishvineyards #spanishwine #economics #distribution #cost #price #tastingroom 
#overhead #business #environment #property #building #food #entertainment 
 
JM: When we visited Spain, economics were great for distribution because the vines were 
planted in a row, they grew, and however which way, they came through once during the light 
summer with a wire on each side, and just you yanked it up and pulled them up together. They 
might have sprayed 2 or 3 times during the season, there was no fences, no raccoons, no bears, 
no birds, no predators, no nothing. Growing these giant grape clusters that can tolerate the mild 
winters. It was crazy. I was like, no wonder you guys can make wine that sells for 10 dollars a 
bottle. That's still oaken, good wine that you're making for like 3. Whereas, even if you just 
eliminate the whole concept of the overhead of the business and the tasting room, I can't make a 
bottle of wine for less than 11 dollars. It's ridiculous how expensive running this type of business 
is. So then you either could dodge the whole tasting room model and go into distribution but 
you're going to have a hard time making money because then you can't compete on price. and 
then once you have a nice wine, and you create a nice enough environment between the piece of 
property, the building, the ambiance, a lot of the cost of wine in Virginia is how much more has 
to go into the overall package to be able to do this. So Virginia wine could lean towards a little 
bit more expensive. Hopefully then you're at least getting a good wine back for it. Whereas 
sometimes you're paying that extra money because there's live music and there's a slushie 
machine and there's a pizza truck. And you're getting entertainment. And in this world, you pay 
for entertainment no matter where you go and what you do, so I'm not saying that's wrong, it's 
just that you're paying through the bottle for that entertainment.

normal day, you're not going in. But, you got to pay an extra $10 for your bottle of wine, you do 
it. So, Virginia's a little bit more expensive. So we can't compete in distribution. All I can work

out is some marketing advantage. But the amount of effort that goes into making those sales and 
placements is phenomenal. And the time commitment there is huge. So we instead hunker down 
here and are mostly a word-of-mouth growth business. It's referrals, reputation, kind of growth 
pattern. It's not advertising, because again we're a kind of niche kind of select market type of 
thing. So yes we are out of here. And only thing that I'll circle back and mention that I think we 
should but I forgot is, as we connect with people, is the concept of the name itself, Arterra. And 
that is the art of the land. And so it's the land because we consider it a true expression of the site 
because the yeast and the fruit come from the site. That's a true expression of the land that we're 
on. And it's an artistic expression of that land because it is an intuitive wine-making process, 
based on perceiving the vine, the grapes, the wine, as they evolve. As opposed to an analytical 
wine-making process which is lab testing, numbers and so forth. Because you as the consumer, 
customer, you care about how the wine tastes, maybe, but you don't care if it was pH 3.2 or 3.67. 
You don't care. So we don't go by numbers. We are defined as the art of the land as the concept 
of how we do things here.

JM: My parents are about an hour and a half away, so are Sandy's parents, so we see them but 
not all the time. I have brother over in Maryland, don't see him that much, and it's busy because 
the kids are an age where they need parents. And they're involved in activities, all different 
directions, and we're living in an area where everything is spread out. To get from home to 
anything is 25 minutes. Home to here is 25 minutes, home to the elementary school is 25 
minutes, home to town is 25 minutes, and to connect any of those three points is 25 minutes. So 
you can't leave the house without having lost an hour minimum no matter what. just driving, the 
miles we put on our car are insane. But we love the quietness where we live. But we have family, 
house that we take care of, here I am winemaker, grape-grower, business manager, bookkeeper, 
tasting room manager, Sandy does all the communications with our newsletters, club members, 
all the social media, marketing, branding, imagery, all the artwork, we both do any wine-related 
focused event type stuff that we do as long as it's like about the wine. But she does all that type 
of stuff. So between the two of us, we run all sides of the business, and there's never enough

psychologically, you try to get every second you can out of a day, and it's exhausting. And you 
just want to collapse. And then there's the personal factors that come in on top of that is. I've had 
for 2 decades, pretty significant back problems. It's hard after all this to find the time to do your 
yoga when you're exhausted and you just want to lay down. But if you don't take care of 
yourself, you're in worse shape. And Sandy went through some things that forced her into a lot of 
dietary restrictions. No choice in the matter, it wasn't just for the novelty of it. But she had to 
completely change diet which ended up good for us. Again, helped us a lot with understanding 
health of what we're consuming in the wine. But she basically has to cook everything. She can't 
eat out, she can't go to restaurants, there's always something in there. You can't get your 
packaged foods, your pre-made things, you can't just buy a frozen thing and throw it in the oven. 
And if you actually have to cook 3 meals a day, whether you're home, at work, or on the road, 
like people used to do back in the 30s or 40s, and have kids and have a business like this? It's 
nuts. So it's really hard and we're looking forward to the time when we can afford that extra help 
just to take the edge off. And we don't want to not do what we do, we love it. We look at it as 
this is who we are and what we do, and we don't know how to do or be anything else. Life has 
led us here, and this is our role. But it would be nice if it was a step easier. And Joaquin asked 
me, he's like, "yeah I just heard on the news the other day a woman hit the lottery and she called 
work the next day and said she's never coming back." He's like, "if you hit the lottery, would you 
do that?" I'm like, well first of all I would need to play the lottery in order to win it and second 
no! I love this. I would just like it to not be so constantly overwhelming.

JM: And we're looking hopefully in another full year getting to where the business tips into the 
black. Past that point. And it's really hard and really stressful, the first couple years really bad. 
This spring was really good for us. And was really comforting and we do great January through 
May when people are coming in this colder season to check out good wine. And then once you 
hit the late summer and the fall, people are going to the places that have a party on the patio. And 
they don't show up here so much. So my growth rate through the spring has been impressive. My 
growth rate through the fall, not so impressive. But it's really hard when you've gone through a 
year and you say well, we're doing this month, month, month, month, month, month, and then do 
you say "well, we can assume it's going to carry out through the rest of the year, or not and you 
just never know. So it's been really hard with the economics because we put in everything, the 
collateral as this property, our house, everything. We're a case where everything is on the line 
and there's only so much fallback. 
[01:05:58]

JM: We have certain people, one or two people, that are really key and are conceptually there for 
us. But you want to make it. On your own. You don't want to work insane effort and then 
psychologically feel like you didn't make it on your own. That's really hard. That there's no 
greater effort that could have been put in. No more efficient model or cost-savings that could 
have been implemented. and you just hope you get there. Because I don't know any other winery,

and I'm sure if someone hears this, they will know one that goes against this rule. But I don't 
know any other winery that started like we started. And there's some that started modest and 
humble and fine. But most people either have a previous career, had some wealth, retired, started 
a business, oversee it, or inherited land. Inherited money to then use on the land. And they don't 
have the basic cost that we do to start the business. Or one of them is interested in this business, 
and one isn’t. And one of them still has their career and has health insurance. And has money 
that can pay the basic mortgage and put food on the table. We're both all in on this because we 
had to be to make it work. If I wasn't here and I was out working somewhere else, I'd probably 
be making less money than the guy I would pay here to be doing what I'm doing. And it doesn't 
work.

#reporting 
 
JM: We were completely in. From when we signed that loan and closed January of 2014. I 
actually left previous work, the end of June 2014. But we are making it solely on this business in 
a way that I don't know any other winery. Some wineries are looked at as overgrown hobbies of 
rich people--for the most part they are. And that's hard to compete with because they can 
advertise like crazy, and they can offer huge discounts to where the customer expectation is that 
the place should be huge and amazing, there should be all this live music and entertainment and 
stuff to do and activities going on, and you should get all kinds of stuff for free, and all kinds of 
huge deep discount. And when you can't afford to offer those things, a lot of consumers are 
going to look at you and go, that guy down the road's got a bigger, fancier building, and it's a 
better bargain than you. And then there's going to be those select few customers that say "the 
concept of what you're doing here has such integrity to it. And they connect with it. and then you 
have ten times the loyalty and attention from the people that you do connect with. So we have an 
upside but it's a harder way to start and I really don't know many people that could pull this off. 
Most winemakers are winemakers and that's what they do. Most winemakers would not be able 
to build a building the way that we built a building. Most of them have not done the federal 
license, the state license, the annual reporting, the monthly reporting, the taxes, the cashflow 
budgets, the whole thing. 
[01:09:53] 
#costs #expenses #overhead 
 
JM: Because it's not just making wine! And it's also tough because people look at you and if you 
look at the income side of what comes in through the register, it looks pretty good. But nobody 
can understand that running as small and tiny of an operation as we have here, that your 
operating costs just to survive the year are upwards of 400,000 dollars a year. And they're like, 
"how is that possible?" and they don't believe you. But it is. It's an expensive business and I have 
a hard time especially because of how long it takes from getting a vine in the ground or picking 
the grape to selling it and cash-flowing it. But I have a hard time picking out a business that 
could possibly be harder.

#smallbusiness #familybusiness #america 
 
JM: We have gotten to where we are so embedded in family small business that we will go to 
great lengths and extra expense to support other family small businesses because that is what 
America was founded on and made it great. Now I don't even want to imagine what number of 
people are working at the box stores for 9 bucks an hour and don't have any choice. The world is 
in a hard place. 
[01:11:48] 
KS: You've kind of made your own world here, though, haven't you? 
#price #cost #accessibility #affordability 
JM: We have. But again, it's not the cheapest wine, so it's hard to say if you really value the 
quality in the ingredients, it's hard to say well I only make 10 bucks an hour I don't want to buy 
that wine at that price. I can buy this cheap stuff for 7 bucks in the store. How can you argue 
with that? 
[01:12:13] 
KS: Does that bother you a bit, that it's like not accessible to everybody because of the cost? 
#tourism #discounts #clubdiscounts #wineclubs #cases #casediscounts 
JM: We do as good as we can to make our business work. And we are priced based on a 
comparable quality in the overall bigger wine world market. We are not tourist priced. We are 
quality basis priced. Which puts you in a bracket that is beyond some people what they look for, 
like the bulk of wine drinkers just want the 9 dollar bottle of wine. The statistics just straight up 
show it. what we do different though, is we price the bottle based on what it should be priced. 
Then if you are getting to our club through like bigger purchases, you get a nice little discount 
Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017
31 
 
that shows we appreciate you and want to retain you. But it's not a big discount. All the 
marketing people that walk in the door say, "your 40 dollar bottle should be 60 dollars a bottle so 
that when somebody buys a case, they get at 35% discount, and you get your 40 bucks still for 
it." But these people feel like they're made special and they're getting their bargain and they're 
extra cool and everything's great. That's fine and all, except for the fact that, what about the 
person that comes in that can only afford one bottle. Should that person have to pay 60 bucks 
opposed to 40? Whereas the person that can afford to buy an $800 case of wine, gets a huge 
discount? No. We try and focus it towards people that are on our economic reality. Which is, you 
might buy a bottle, you might buy 6, you might buy 12, you might buy whatever it is, but if you 
value what you're buying, that's why you're buying it. You're supporting w o the people are and 
how it's made. We don't try and price people out, I don't try and price to weed out people that 
don't have money. I don't believe in that. And after that it's choices of what people do or don't do 
or can't do with their money. but it's not we’re not trickery, we're not gimmicks, just "this is what 
this is worth." 
[01:14:38] 
KS: Anything else that you want to add? 
JM: I'm sure I'll think of all kinds of stuff. 
KS: Well I can always come back and talk to you again. But I feel like also talking about how 
much little time you have, I feel like we've already taken so much of your time, I feel like 
hopefully just because of the rain maybe you've had a little leeway today in your schedule? 
 
JM: Yeah and the timing worked out fine. And I think things like this are somewhat important. 
I'd love to see what ...I do have one other point. But to see what this all looks like after you've 
done this project, and then to look at it in 20, 30 years. Because I think this is why I was 
interested. This will be my last point. If you're good on time? 
[01:15:25] 
KS: Oh yeah. 
 
#virginia #virginiawine #virginiawineindustry#vineries 
 
JM: Virginia's at a really interesting phase right now. One thing is me and my lifestyle, which is 
different from you interviewed the wealthy guy that started a winery and he's got tier after tier 
after tier of managers and it just runs like a corporate business. We're not that. My lifestyle's 
captured. It's crazy, there’s two modes: there's insane and then just plain stupid. And you're one 
or the other. But Virginia's at a really interesting point, and I have concern. And I have concern 
because I need to support my family through this business. And the industry has to have a certain 
integrity in order for it to continue on a positive path. And I don't feel like anybody's right or 
wrong for how they do things, and I don't want to take people down from different models, 
Winery Workers in Virginia

because customer A is looking for this place, and customer B is looking for that place, they 
should find the place they like. That's perfectly fair.

#californiagrapes 
 
JM: My concern is that the straight up make-a-dollar capitalist business mentality is going to be 
damaging to the long-term potential in Virginia, because there are a lot of wineries that use either 
half or all of their fruit from out of state. California, Washington. And we started with one wine, 
because we didn't have enough white from a grower we know up in the Finger Lakes, and we did 
that for two years and then we phased that out as our production picks up. But a basic farm 
winery concept, and there's different ways you going to have this. The basic farm winery concept 
in Virginia was 75% Virginia fruit, and if there's a bad winter, or frost, or hailstorm, or 
something, you lose the crop. You can supplement that with more out-of-state if you get an 
approval from ABC. Instead, what has happened is Bob with a bunch of money shows up to start 
a business, a big hopping place down on the big road, and says, we are built out and opening our 
doors as a 10,000 case winery. There isn't enough fruit in Virginia to be a 10,000 case winery, 
therefore, I need to bring all this fruit in from the west coast. 
[01:18:00] 
#policies #regulations #virginiapolicy #virginiaABC #washingtonpost #robertparker 
#winemagazines #winewriters #reviews #winetourism 
 
JM: Point number one is, if you're business didn't have established on paper to start with 75% 
Virginia fruit, it shouldn't have been allowed. So the big places wouldn't be big places, if they 
were forced to use the right amount of Virginia fruit. They would have been smaller, and then 
more customers would have ended up spread out amongst the rest of us little ones all spread 
around. So there's a lapse and a precedent. And at that point there was a bunch that popped up 
and said, "we're a 10,000 case winery, we can only find 1,000 cases worth of Virginia wine. The 
rest comes in from the West Coast." I understand. You're a business man, you put a lot of money 
in, it's a big place, you got a cash flow to pay for it, it's business. Cool. More wineries, more 
wine, more people come. Growth of an industry. Cool. That's neat. Industry has to keep growing. 
Short-term game. Long-term risk. All the big wine writers and I don't know all their names 
because I'm not in that world, but you take all the wine writers through Washington Post and 
Robert Parker and whoever all these other people are. And if they all start doing reviews that go, 
"why would you waste your time going to Virginia wine country if you want Washington State 
wine, or if you want California wine, go buy it in California or Washington, or buy it at half the 
price in the grocery store. Why are you going to some Virginia overpriced winery to get a 40 
dollar bottle of red wine that is the same wine as is on the store shelf for 10 bucks?" All of a 
sudden, the concept of Virginia as a wine region to get respect and growth of true wine tourists 
coming for wine is dead. And then you are condemned to only be a local entertainment industry 
and you are a rural bar and that's all you will ever be.

JM: At which point less and less will be able to do what we did. Because people that appreciate 
wine quality will know it's not worth trying. If 9 out of 10 end up being not local fruit, I as a 
wine consumer wouldn't go. I'd say why am I wasting my time. So that's my concern. Is that 
Virginia already kind of mis-grew. And I don't hold it against the individual wineries because 
the     market is there. The customers seem fine with it. This is a positive example of this: you go up 
to Stone Tower in Leesburg. Complete opposite of our place. It's monstrous. It's beautiful. And 
their main wine brand, they tell you straight up not hiding it, this is California wine. They don't 
hide it. People there they love it, it's great. So how can I blame them, because the customer's 
there. Whereas would it have been a different situation if ABC said, "no, you can't do that. You 
can only do this." They would have built a completely different business if that was the case. 
They’re a great example, because they disclose and the customer accepts, and I think there is 
different versions of licensing that you can do these things. 
[01:22:03] 
#VirginiaWineBoard #GrowersGroups 
 
KS: I know there's all these different groups like the Virginia Wine Board and different growers' 
groups and things. Are people pushing back? I would assume that the majority of the wineries 
are more on the side…I would assume you're more in the minority. 
 
#LoudonCounty 
JM: At least in terms of our focus on fruit quality, local production we are smaller percentage of 
us. Loudon County is an example because there's a lot of wineries in Loudon County and I 
worked in Loudon County for a while. And if you add up how many vineyards are up there 
compared to how much wine is going through, I'm not sure it balances. But again, I don't want to 
slander an entire region. Because there are some up there that are incredible and do things great, 
and with integrity and so forth, but when you're selling several thousand cases of wine and your 
vineyard is the size of my building, which is a small building...So that's just my concern is that it 
will be hard for the industry to grow once this decision of how business is done comes back to 
haunt you. And it may not ever. But you got to look at the 4state. They want the tax revenue. 
And the enforcement agency is understaffed. So there's no one place to place blame, there is 
more of an  issue in the industry not so publicly as to whether or not it's local wine and so forth, 
that does come up to some extent conceptually, but I don't think it's going anywhere because 
nobody wants to be the guy who points fingers at the other wineries and then all of a sudden 
you're getting no referrals. So I don't think anybody wants to take the risk of fighting that fight. 
[01:24:11] 
#cabernetfranc #perditperdot #restaurant #food #events #winecountry #licensing #compliance 
JM: But from the public point of view, there has been a tremendous pushback in evaluation now 
from the state level, and it's happened at local levels also. Of wineries using the winery license to 
be events businesses. The winery point of view is anything we do that gets people here and sells 
wine is a wine accessory event. People come here, they drink wine, it's a wine event. It's to sell 
more wine. Which like when we do our wine event, it's a tasting of different vintages of Cabernet 
Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017

Franc. Or it's a comparison of different sites of Petit Verdot, or it's the new wines that are coming 
out. And people come and they focus on the wine. As opposed to luau night. And they're 
drinking  wine. And there's a lot of food service provided, and their winery licensing is all music, 
all entertainment, all the weddings, and I don't really hold it against the wineries for wanting to 
do those things to be profitable, but I feel like if they were restricted from doing those things, 
other business and entrepreneurs would come in to fill the gap. So if people need restauranty- 
food out in wine country, a person should open a restaurant. If you want to do receptions and 
events, someone should open an event center. And a lot times the licensing to do those things, 
the requirements to get those licenses, the wineries wouldn't be in compliance with. So then 
they're getting away with things and an unfair advantage, but then somebody else goes "Well I 
have to jump through all these extra hoops and all these extra expenses for me to do this 
business, when you're doing it without all that regulation.” It again makes it an unfair playing 
field. And it takes people like me, that could be some family that has, land, you grew up out 
here, you want to start a local retreat center, all of a sudden you're like, how am I supposed to do 
this, when there's an unfair market competition. [They laugh.]

#signage #bluesigns #brownsigns #route50 #highway #USDA #bribery #lawyers #sue 
 
JM: So that is being scrutinized at the state level right now and it's going to be a really difficult 
thing to difficult, both out-of-state wine and the events thing, because how do you take 
businesses that have been doing these things, for 5-10 years, and say, "you can't do it anymore." 
And if you don't do that, is it really far, "alright well you guys can keep doing it, but you new 
wineries can't." It's not really fair to them either. So we have an issue of the signage. There's blue 
signs and there's brown signs. The brown signs was a program that was phased out 10 years ago. 
On highways and secondary roads. And it is, "whatever winery, left, .5 miles." Big brown signs. 
Everybody sees them. They phased this program out 10 years ago, they said people that already 
had them are grandfathered in, they can keep their signs. And then as a new winery you can only 
get a blue sign. And there's all rules about where you can and can't put them. And I say "I want 
one here" and they say "no you can't because there's a set of rules." But that guy down there has a 
sign that violates the rules that you just said. "Well we decided it on a case-by-case basis." "Well 
can you review mine?" "Well, there's a set of rules." "But I just mentioned that guy." "Well it's a 
case-by-case basis." "But what about mine?" "Well submit your application and then we can 
reject you." Well, thanks. And then, nobody sees the blue signs. They all look at the brown signs. 
So old program discontinued. So what happened 3 months ago? All these old, run-down looking 
brown signs all got pulled off and put up brand new, shiny, brand-new signs. [KS laughs.] I'm 
like, if a program is discontinued, doesn't that mean that that's done? And then a new winery 
can't get the big brown sign. So not to mention their name, but there's one up on Route 50 that 
business sold. The old business that had the brown sign shut down. New business started, the 
way wine works, that license is gone, done. New LLC New federal and state wine license, new 
everything. It's a different business. Brand new big shiny brown sign went up with the name of 
the business, and I'm like, there's two things going on in this world, either there's impressive 
bribery, which I can't afford, or you can't afford to pay your lawyer to sue them until they back 
down and give you want you want, which I can't do either. So those are the things, all these 
things are why this has been hard, because to be a little guy without money, there's other than the 
fact that we're in agriculture, and the USDA has a good loan program, there is nothing in the

Unites States of America right now that caters to a small family entrepreneurial business. 
Healthcare's against you, regulations are against you, lawyers are against you, every which way 
you turn, something is meant to knock you down so you end up working at the Walmart. 
Literally, other than that USDA loan program to help me as a farmer get going, I can't mention a 
single thing about this society that actually helps and doesn't outright try and just wreck. And this 
is what the country was founded on. That's my last point.
