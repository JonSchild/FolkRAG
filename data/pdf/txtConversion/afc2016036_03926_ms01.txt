[00:00] Introductions. Has lived in New Bedford for 10 years, 5 years have been working in the 
fishing industry. He is from Santa Lucia, Cotzumalguapa, Guatemala. Shares about life back in 
Guatemala and coming to America at the age of 30. Before living in New Bedford he lived for a 
short while in Providence, Rhode Island. 
[05:55] Jobs before obtaining his position in the warehouse. How he got his job in the fishing 
industry. His job at the warehouse is managing storage. Regular work day at warehouse is 
unloading what the company has ordered, such as cardboards and plastics. It is a small 
warehouse. Also works inside the cooler, storing the fish that is purchased at the auctions. 
[10:52] Fish from the auctions are bought in New Bedford. They store various types of fish, 
squids, and shrimp. They do not have scallops. His main job is warehouse storage, he only deals 
with fish if there is less work to do in the warehouse. 
[14:09] Uniforms used at work. Talks about filleting the fish. They use very sharp knives to get a 
good fillet out of the fish. Different types of fish are cut differently. It requires a lot of skill to be 
able to cut fish and not be injured. 
[19:40] The most interesting part of the job is described as everything, because he is not 
pressured from his superiors he is able do his job at his own pace. The hardest part of the job is 
the long work days that sometimes are required. Long days range around 12 hours. Regular work 
days are around 7 to 8 hours, 35-40 hours a week. Job hours vary depending on the merchandise 
that is brought in and out of the warehouse. Work is usually busier when the market price drops. 
[26:54] Work hour salary is discussed. Salary is very dependent on the work skill. Works 
through a staffing agency not a directly by the company. Gender differences in the work area. 
Women usually clean the fish after it is cut. The cutting of fish is a male dominated skill in this 
industry. 
[35:31] Diversity of co-workers is discussed. Environment is very diverse from many different 
Central American countries and locals from the area. Some arguments during work have 
happened but company has a zero tolerance for fights during work, therefore everyone does their 
best to get along. At work Spanish is very common to be spoken. English is the dominant 
language. English is very needed to be able to advance in a job, it brings more opportunities. 
Some co-workers are only Spanish speaking and are able to work there. 
[41:30] Shares about relationship with brother. Mother and other family members are still in 
Guatemala. Is uncertain if he will remain in the fishing industry. If he is promoted in the future
