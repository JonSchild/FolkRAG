SLENDER NIGS. 
Written by W M. BRYANT expressly for BRYANT S
C. W ILLIAMS. 
Oh here we are the slender nigs, 
As you can plainly see: 
We've just stepped out to have a 
stroll, 
My brother, Jim, and me. 
It's our delight to dance by night, 
Your favors try to win; 
You'll see that we are full of life, 
Although we are so thin. 
(Break.) 
They call h:m Dancing Pete, ( Sym.) 
(Break.) 
Just watch him throw his feet, (Sym.) 
You bet we are two first-class figs, 
Is me and Brother Jim; 
The ladies all do fall in love, 
Because we are so thin. 
But now, kind folks, we'll bid adieu. 
We can no longer stay; 
But we'll dance a 
little step or two 
Before we go away. 
And if by chance you see us here, 
Some time that you drop in, 
You'll not forget us lively mokes, 
Because we are so thin. 
(Break.) 
They call him, etc.

BRIGHT-EYED LOU. 
Written by HARRY BENNETT, 
Expressly for BRYANT S: 
W ILLIAMS. 
1Then twilight falls so soft and sweet, 
And silent is the hour, 
My charming girl I 
long to meet, 
"Within some leafy bower. 
And whisper sweet tales in her ear, 
And promises so true. 
To me she is the one most dear, 
My little bright-eyed Lou. 
CHORUS. 
(Break.) Her dancing smiles they seem to cheer my heart. (
Syirt.) 
(Break.) I'm sorely wounded with little cupid's dart. 
(Sym.) 
Her smiles will ever cheer my way, 
She's loving, kind and true. 
I'm waiting for that happy day, 
I'll wed my bright-eyed Lou. 
Her voice is full of melody, 
Her lips are rosy red. 
She wears a 
jaunty little hat 
Upon her darling head; 
A cunning little foot. Oh, my I 
The size is number two, 
all these charms that make me love 
My little bright eyed Lou. (Break.) 
Her flancing smiles, & c, 
WE NEVER MISS A MEAL. 
Written by W M. BRYANT for BRYANT S: 
W ILLIAMS. 
Before you stands two thorough-breds. 
Of first-class, high-toned style, 
You can find us a 
free lunch stand, 
For we're eating all the while. 
They say that's what makes us so thin, 
But for that we never squeal, 
We're never known to pay a 
cent, 
Nor ever miss a 
meal. 
At the first stroke of the dinner gong 
You should see us make a 
leap, 
We drink up the good new milk. 
And swallow up the meat. 
When the waiter turns his back to IN, 
The pies then we do steal, 
For the landlord he might chuck us out, 
And then we'd miss a 
meal. 
Now all you roosters, do like us, 
Don't let your lips hang down. 
And don't go too far away, 
To hear the dinner sound. 
Should the land lord make a 
bluff at you. 
Be as slippery as an eel. 
Tell him, old man, you'll never stand 
To miss a 
good square meal. 
Written by W ILLIAM BRYANT for Miss LIZZIE RICHMOND. 
While sitting by the fire one day, 
A 
subject came to me, 
How people get along so nice, 
And how I 
can not see. 
Some people have just what they want, 
Believe me, I 
am true; 
You needn't take my word for that, 
I'll leave it all to you. 
Now has it e'er occurred to you.. 
(How strange it seems to me!) 
These girls they glide along the streets— 
Much less than twenty-three. 
Their pa's are poor, but still they dress 
In silks and satins. too, 
Now how they get all' these good clothes— 
I'll leave it all to you. 
A man and wife that I 
know well, 
Don't agree. I 
must confess; 
Because they have no children to 
Complete their happiness. 
The father wants a 
little girl, 
And ma a 
boy, that's two; 
Now how they're going to get them— 
I'll leave it all to you. 
So now l've sung my rhymes to you, 
I 
hope I've pleased you all; 
Some other night I'd be all right 
To make another call. 
And when. I 
come back here to sing, 
I'll bring you something new; 
But that is not for me to say— 
:zo I'll leave it all 
Sung by YALE. 
There is a 
dart that pierced my heart, 
'Twas thrown by a 
darling 
Whose eyes are bright as diamonds, 
And her hair hangs down in curls. 
I 
can't forget the evening, 
When first we chanced to meet: 
We were riding in an omnibus, 
She smiled on me so swoet. 
Cuont-s. 
Oh, I'd he as happy as a 
bumble-bee, 
That flies around the street; 
If I 
could only find the girl 
That smiled on me so sweet. 
I 
tried in vain to meet her, 
Ever since that happy night 
That I 
met my little fair one, 
For I 
loved her at first sight. 
But still I'm not discouraged, 
For I 
live in hopes to meet 
This darling little creature, 
That smiled on me so sweet. 
Oh, I'd be as happy, ete.

HOOP 'EM UP 'LIZA JANE, 
Goin' across de mountain, 
I 
gave my horn a 
blow, 
Thought I 
heard Miss ' Liza 
Yonder comes my beau. 
She's nicer than the roses, 
That grow down on the plain, 
I 
lub dat little yaller gal— 
My sweet ole Liza Jane. 
If you want to buy a 
horse, 
Don't bny a 
horse dat's lame: 
But if you want to buy a 
mule, 
Buy ole 'Liza Jane. 
She's sweeter dan de 'lasses, 
Dat drops from sugar cane; 
She is de darlin' oh my heart— 
My sweet ole Liza Jane. 
CLOWN OF THE PANTOMINE, 
One night I 
was kindly invited 
To take a 
fair girl to a 
show, 
And with it I 
was so delighted, 
That I 
quite forgot my dear Jo. 
Until I 
beheld my fair damsel. 
On whom I 
had spent so much time, 
A winking and flirting like fury 
With the clown of the pantomime. 
It made me so wild and uneasy, 
That I 
did not dare to turn ' round, 
For fear that I'd see my dear Josey 
A winking at the pantomime clown. 
The clown would make funny faces, 
Then heels over head he would go; 
And throw himself down by the footlights, 
Then smile and look over at Jo. 
Oh, then, how I 
wished I 
was near him, 
I'd punch off the half of his crown; 
For I 
couldn't bear to see Josey 
In love with a 
pantomime clown. 
Next day I 
went to call on her, 
But Josey wasn't to he found; 
Her mother she sobbed as she told me— 
She'd run off with a 
pantomime clown.

Lookin' out de window he saw a

Dis am de story he told me, 
All about de animals he did see— 
Skunk on de wall blowin' his nose, 
Frogs dressed up in soldier elo's; 
Geese and de gander and de ole gray nag, 
Joined in de chorus and " rallied ' round de flag I" 
Cuottus. 
Hop along, Peter, hop along, hop along, 
Hop along, Peter, hop along, hop along, 
Hop along, Peter, whar you gwine? 
Never go back on gooseberry wine. 
Owls in de gardan winkin' and a

Cats in de pantry chasin' mice 
Ducks in de attic playin' poker, 
Spider in cobweb shakin' dice. 
Nigger up a 
tree sayin' his prayers, 
Nigger chewin' railroad iron upstairs; 
'Sally in de garden siftin: peas, 
Tome and, kiss me if you please. 
Hop along, etc.

POVERTY. 
Written by W ILLIAM SCANLAN, and sung by SCANLAN & 
ORoNnt, 
in their Original Sketch, entitled " POVERTY." 
Farewell, dear home, farewell to all 
The comforts of this world. 
We're ould, we're helpless and forlorn. 
In the street from our home we are hurled. 
A 
time was when joy ne'er left our home, 
Oh, 'twas then our poor hearts beat with glee, 
But now to the poor house we must go, 
The cause is poverty. 
CHORUS. 
May Heaven protect us day and night, 
Where ever we may be; 
So to the poor house we must go; 
The cause is poverty. 
I've looked for work, but all in vain— 
They say that I'm too mild, 
I've gone and begged from door to door 
To keep out the hunger and cold; 
But Mary, dear, when we are dead, 
And they ask what became of you and me, 
They can never say we robbed or stole, 
But died from poverty. 
May Heaven, .te.

white folks we hope that we have 1)leased yoLl. 
Do our best now we are going to try. 
Our home is in the south, down in Caroiina, 
Nnd we're red not -hunIcv horn boys. 
We ..,an sing and dance and play the banjo, 
Doing the pigeon wing we don't stand far behind. 
We're happy on the boats that run the river. 
And when we dance we always come in time. 
One day we wont down in Louisanna. 
That's where the cotton pods do grow. 
And went to New Orleans upon the levey, 
And there to the figs we some dancing showed. 
We jumped on the boat, went up the Mississippi, 
The passengers they asked us for to dance. 
We told them to form a 
little circle. 
Clear the upper deck, give us nigs a 
chance. 
As sung by WILLIAM ScANLAN. 
(Air---" Pat Won't Go Horn.: Till Morning.”) 
It was only on the tenth of last Noventher. 
That we heard the news we ever shall remember, 
That the fire-king had cast its burning embers 
O'er another fated city in our land. 
As the woeful tidings flashed along the wire, 
Of this other sad catastrophe so dire, 
That Boston, beallteuiti city war on tire, 
And sinking 'neath 
r.:Intless hand. 
CtioRCS. 
Fire ! fire ! was heard the cry, 
In every breeze that passed us by, 
And all the world did heave a 
sigh of pity; 
Fervent prayers to heaven to aid, 
Before the fire in ruins laid, 
Fair Boston, beauteous city. 
And all through the terrible commotion, 
The wind blew a 
gale from off the ocean, 
The brave firemen worked with all devotion, 
To laugh at their efforts yet it seemed; 
And soared with fiery prayer still higher, 
O'er chimney top, steeple and church spire, 
Till all was one vast flame of fire. 
And the light around the horizon gleamed. 
Fire ! fire ! was heard, etc. 
But who saved the city from a 
panic, 
From the rule of a 
lire-king too tyr alum% 
But the brave- hearted firemen and Inc hank!, 
The best and the noblest in the land ; 
Far brighter than tae soldier's record of glory, 
Are the names of those who live in song or story, 
Who rebuild the city to its former glory, 
And build her up, if possible, more grand.

PETE.—Well, my gracious, how de times am changed and 
how de streets am changed. 
Most ebery ting am changed. 
When I

but a 
lane. 
But dat am nearly ten years ago. 
I

I 
wonder if old. Massa 
Williamson am alive yet, and de old, old, wife ob mine, and de 
chillen, de chillen dey must be grown up now. 
I 
wonder if any 
oh de folks would know me now. 
I 
am not Pete dat was young 
and lively, but Pete dat am gray and feeble. 
I've seen many 
hard times since I 
left home. 
But I 
thought dat I 
could better 
myself by running away. 
But I 
found out my mistake. 
Go 
where you will dere am no place like home. 
I'll just go down 
an see if dey will recognize de old man.

Scene Second, Plantation, 
Cottage R. Tree L. bench 
under

Enter PETE from cottage very slowly, (slow music.) 
PETE.—All am passed away, old Massa am dead, old Missus 
and Hannah am dead. 
All dat was dear to de old man am 
gone, and dar am no one here to speak to me about de place I 
,loved so well. 
(
Sing.) 
THE GOOD OLD HOME. 
Oh! I'm growing aged and gray, 
And my strength fast fades away. 
An' I 
know dat I'll soon be called to go up dar,‘ 
Once I 
was young and gay, 
Singing, dancing all de day, 
But now de gray hab got among my laa!!") 
Old Massa, he am gone 
To dat long and silent home, 
An' now among de angels he does well, 
And before I 
was laid low, 
I 
thought I'd once more go 
To dat good old home I 
always loved so well. 
CHORUS. 
In my home, in my home, 
When I 
think of the past it seems a 
spell. 
An now dat I 
am home, Oh! I 
never more will roam 
From de good old home I 
always loved so well. 
It was an humble little cot, 
Standing in a 
fairy spot, 
Where de roses an de pansies used to grow, 
And de sweet magnolia trees 
Used to tempt de honey-bees, 
And a 
little crystal brook would gently flow, 
When the orange was in bloom, 
It would shed its sweet perfume 
Making like a 
paradise this little dell, 
But how sad dese changes now, 
De old man can only know, 
Dat good old home I 
always loved so well. 
When I 
did go away, 
Oh. dat well remembered day, 
I 
was happy as de birds up in de air; 
But now I'm once more here, 
I 
can feel the scalding tear, 
And I 
hope de angels will soon call me dere. 
Now my wife she's laid away, 
Neath the heavy sod and clay, 
And now she wid de angels dere to dwell; 
And I'm waiting here to-day, 
For her to call me away, 
To dat home above I 
always loved so well.

As sung by HARRY BRAHAM. 
If I 
seem somewhat excited, 
Well, I 
trust I'll be excused, sir, 
My faith and hospitality's 
Been shamefully abused, sir; 
My Angeline—my only child— 
On whom I 
fondly hoped. 
Has driven her father frantic. wild! 
The baggage—she's eloped. 
Cumws. 
On, where's that Jones? 
If I 
catch that Jones, 
I'm sure there will be slaughter; 
Take all I've got—I'd not care a 
jot, 
But don't take an old man's daughter. 
Fool that I 
was! 
I 
let my child, 
The coxcomb introduce, sir, 
And from that fatal moment, 
He has played the very deuce. sir. 
He'd what those chits of girls would 
A 
fascinating manner; 
He'd sing namby-pamby love songs, 
While my child played the " pianer." 
Oh, where's that Jones, etc. 
My girl got so affected, and 
So sad and queer her tones, sir, 
If but a 
day elapsed without 
Her seeing her dear Jones, sir; 
He'd come to dinner, stay to tea, 
Play chess till late at night; 
That she should leave her dad for Tones, 
You'll own was hardly right. 
Oh, where's that Jones, etc. 
Yesterday morn I 
waited, 
To receive her morning kiss, sir, 
She did not come as usual, 
Something I 
feared amiss, sir. 
Before me laid a 
little note, 
Which froze my poor old bones— 
She hoped I 
would forgive her, 
For she'd run away with Jones. 
Oh, where's that Jones, etc.

NAUGHTY MARY ANN. 
As sung by HARRY BRAHAII. 
Oh! naughty naked Cupid, 
With his little bow and arrow, 
Has settled me, who used to be 
As gay as a 
young cock- sparrow; 
Yes, once I 
was as happy 
As a 
Marquis or an Earl: 
But now I'm broken-hearted, 
All thro' a 
false young girl. 
CHORUS. 
Naughty Mary Ann, 
Naughty Mary Ann, 
How could you be so very unkind 
And false to your young man. 
Describe her beauty? 
No, I 
can't, 
And so I 
don't intend; 
The darling lived at a 
bonnet shop, 
In a 
street at the West end. 
I've stood so long in front of it, 
Her form to gaze upon; 
That once or twice a " bobby's" come 
And told me to move on. 
Naughty Mary Ann, etc. 
She used to work there all the day, 
And then go home at night; 
I 
used to 'scort her to the door, 
Which I 
thought such delight; 
I 
told her how I 
loved her more 
Than a 
miser loves his gold; 
And I've waited for her in the rain, 
And caught a 
dreadful cold. 
Naughty Mary Ann, etc.

With her dad I 
used to smoke my pipe, 
And I'd drink tea with her mother; 
'Twas settled in a 
month we should 
Belong to one another. 
So I 
bought the ring, and full of joy, 
To see her went one day, 
When they said a 
soldier'd been and gone, 
And taken her away. 
Naughty Mary Ann, etc. 
She'd known this soldier chap some time, 
Tho' she vow'd to be my wife; 
I 
hope if ever he goes to the wars, 
They'll frighten him out of his life. 
For he and she have ruined me, 
I'm a 
poor unhappy man; 
Bad luck to all false females, and 
Bad luck to Mary Ann! 
Naughty Mary Ann, etc.

I'm going to tell you what I 
know 
Of a 
nice society, 
The ladies, almost every one, 
Declare they are N. G. 
But you're expected at your post 
At every dress parade, 
To stand outside the theatre door 
With the Matinee Brigade. 
CHORUS. 
There on the mash, stuffed with hash. 
Cheeks as hard as rocks! 
There on the street from morn ' till night, 
And never change their socks. 
All in a 
line, rain or shine, 
These rosebuds all parade! 
They stand for ladies to admire 
In the Matinee Brigade! 
Jawdge, and Chawles and Jerome are there, 
Got up with wondrous skill ; 
And when they wink their naughty eye 
It never fails to kill. 
With ten cent canes and dizzy suits 
By a 
sheeny tailor made, 
The choicest plums in all the land 
Are the Matinee Brigade. 
There on the mash, &c. 
They always strike an attitude 
To give themselves a 
tone, 
They live on love and Dutch free lunch, 
And smell of bad cologne! 
I'll bet two cents if the truth was known 
Their wash- bills wasn't paid ; 
But nobody knows how hard they mash 
In the Matinee Brigade!

ABOUT THE HOUR OF THREE. 
Character Song and Dance, witten by JAS. NILES. 
He. 
There's a 
roguish little belle that always comes this way, 
And I 
think its very likely that I'll meet her here to-day; 
She's the sweetest little nymph that ever you did see, 
And she's sure to pass this way about the hour of three. 
She dresses so exquisite this darling little mix, 
Her shoes are number three, her gloves are number six, 
I 
spoke to her one eve as I 
was rambling out, 
She smiled and showed her pretty teeth, 
In a 
most bewitching mouth. 
CHORUS. 
She's sweeter than a 
peach, I 
wish you all to know, 
We first met on the avenue, about two weeks ago; 
She's a 
handsome little belle in that you'll all agree, 
She's always sure to pass this way about the hour of three. 
I 
see the little charmer coming down the street, 
I 
wonder will she angry De if to her I 
speak, 
I 
will linger near and wait a 
little while, 
And should she recognize me 
I 
will bow to her and smile. 
She. 
Oh! there's that handsome fellow that I 
by chance did meet, 
Who spoke to me one evening, coining down the street, 
But I'm sure he don't remember, and has quite forgotten me, 
r 
was just two weeks ago to- day, and about the hour of 
three. 
She's Sweeter, Jcc. 
He. 
GoOo evening Miss, how do you do? 
I've something sweet to say; 
I 
dare to ask your pardon 
For we've met before to-day.

THE cnap I'm going to sing about,

He keeps the corner store above. 
Where he sells his beer and wine,

And he votes for Tammany Hall; 
They will put him up for Alderman, 
If he lives until next fall: 
He has the ward all to himself, 
And it'sthim that cuts a

He commands a

As I 
go down the street, 
There is a 
twinkle in the eye 
Of every girl I 
meet. 
I 
ask'd my Cousin Sally once, 
Why it was she smiled so sweet ? 
She says I 
am a 
perfect dunce— 
They're laughing at your feet! 
CHORUS. 
I 
blushed and bowed my head with grief. 
My anguish to control ; 
And said, when I 
could catch my breath, 
Oh, Sally, bless my soul ! 
Of all the talent I 
possess, 
Those feet they are my pride ; 
They are good size, and cost me less 
To walk with than to ride; 
They always take me out of town 
As fast as I 
can go! 
And Sally fills me with alarm, 
By talking to me so. 
I 
blushed, ciLc, 
Now I've resolved to search this town, 
Some smaller shoes to try; 
That will not draw the glances down 
Of every passer by. 
I'll get a 
smaller pair, I 
vow, 
And dress up in the style ! 
And when I 
meet my love, I'll bow 
And raise my Harvard tile!

LOG CABIN IN DE LANE. 
We am getting old and feeble now, we cannot work no more. 
We have laid the rusty- bladed hoe to rest; 
Old massa and old missus, they're sleeping side by side, 
And their spirits are now roaming with the blest. 
Things are changed about de place, de darkeys dey am gone 
And I

And de only one dats left me is dat good old man of mine, 
In dat little old log cabin in de lane.

happy time to me, ' twas many years ago 
When de darkies used to gather round de door, 
When dey used to dance and sing and I 
played de old ban.io, 
But alas, I

De hinges dey got rusty, and de chimney has fallen down, 
And de roof lets in de sunshine and de rain;

OFF FOR GEORGIA. 
Performed, with great success, all over the country, by

Way down in Georgia, upon the old plantation, 
There's where to live to be happy, light and free; 
And when our work was over, we had a 
new variation, 
And with the nigger wenches we had a 
jubilee. 
Off for Georgia, so early in the morning; 
01T for Georgia before the break of day. 
Give our respects to all the pretty yaller gals, 
For we're off for Georgia before the break of day. 
'Way down in Georgia, upon the old plantation: 
Oh, how quick the day did pass, so happy light and free, 
I

Dancing on the green, by the double rule of three.

I 
am thinking to-day of dem years dat pass'd away, 
When dey tied me up in bondage long ago; 
In old Virginny State, it was dar we separate, 
And it fill'd my heart with misery and woe. 
Dey took away my boy, he was his mother's joy, 
From a 
baby in de cradle we him raise ; 
Oh, dey put us far apart, an' it broke de old man's heart ; 
In dem agonizing, cruel slay'ry days. 
CHORUS. 
Dey never come again, let us give our praise to Him, 
Who looks down whar de little children play; 
So ev'ry night and morn, we will pray for dem dat's gone. 
In dem agonizing, cruel slay'ry days. 
Still my inem'ry will steal o'er, to dat dear old cabin floor, 
When de shadow of de sun came peeping in; 
[bark, 
At night, when all was dark, we would hear de watch-dog 
And we'd listen to de murmur of de wind. 
It seem to say to me, " You people must be free," 
For de happy time am coming, Lord be prais'd! 
For then we would weep and moan, for our souls were not 
our own, 
In dem agonizing, cruel slay'ry days. 
I 
am very old and feeble, and our life am nearly done, 
I 
have travel'd in the roughest kind of road ; [ last, 
Thro' sickness, toil and sorrow, I 
have reach'd de end at 
And I'm resting by de wayside wid my load. 
Forget now and forgive, has always been my guide, 
For dat's what de golden Scripture surely says ; 
But our mem'ry will turn roan, when our souls dey were 
tied down,

You'll Miss Me When I'm Gone. 
As sung by T. M . 
HENGLER. 
I 
am growing old and feeble, 
My hair is turning gray 
My limbs are weak and painful— 
Are stiff, and won't obey. 
My dancing days are over, 
My pleasures are all gone ; 
For goodness, not for greatness, 
You'll miss me when I'm gone. 
CHORUS. 
When I'm gone, you will miss me ; 
When I'm gone, you will miss me ; 
There is one kind heart will miss me, when I'm gone. 
When I'm gone, you will miss Me ; 
When I'm gone, you will miss A ; 
There is one kind heart will miss me, when I'm gone. 
What will you do without me 
When Winter time comes on? 
Who'll fold their arms around you, 
As I 
have often done ? 
Who'll hug you, and caress you, 
When I 
above have flown? 
You'll know where you can find me, 
But you'll miss me when I'm gone. 
When I'm gone, &e.

LITTLE SUNSHINE. 
Copyrighted, 1875, by T. M. HENGLEZ. 
A Medley, Song and Dance. 
Written by J. J. Mc 
DEBMOTT, for T. M. HENGLER. 
Awake, my love, Awake! the Moon is shining, 
The little Stars are peeping from above; 
Come, wander with me where the roses twining, 
Send forth their sweet perfume for thee, my love. 
We'll stroll amid the rosebuds while they are sleeping, 
To the spot where we've passed many happy hours, 
I'll tell you, love, the secrets I 
am keeping, 
While cupid leads us through his rosy bowers. 
CHORUS. 
Awake! Awake! Awake! 
'Neath your window, little Sunshine, 
I'm waiting for ray pride; 
For I 
am happy little Sunshine 
When you linger by ray side. 
(Dance.) 
Oh ! We'll be like two turtle doves, 
Two turtle doves, 
Two turtle doves. 
And fond and true will be our loves, 
No matter come what may, 
And all will be a 
bright sunshine. 
A 
bright sunshine, 
A 
bright sunshine. 
And joy will reign when she is mine, 
For us, both night and day. (Dance, Polka time.) 
My beautiful Sunshine, the jewel of my heart, 
From her, my own darling, I 
never will part; 
She's fairest and brightest, I 
love her so well, 
My darling is sweeter than flowers in the dell; 
\,4 
tity sweet little Sunshine, the light of her eyes, 
Far purer and brighter ne'er shown from the skies, 
Will cast its bright rays o'er the pathway of life, 
And e'er guide my footsteps through sorrow and strife. 
WaUzi 
Cheeks so plump and rosy, 
She's my little posey, 
Pretty little, charming little, darling Sunshine ; 
With her charms enriching, 
She is so bewitching, 
Happy day will be the day that I 
can call her mine. 
[Dance—Schottische. 
She promised she would meet me 
At the little garden gate, 
Where she often comes to greet me, 
At about the hour of eight; 
To whisper that sweet story 
She has whispered o'er and o'er ; 
She often said she loved me, 
yes, a 
thousand times or more. 
(Dance—Polka. 
Sweet little Sunshine, 
Dear little Sunshine, 
She is all in life to me ; 
I'm in clover, 
Love all over, 
Don't you wish that you was me ? 
She's like a 
butterfly, 
She's like a 
butterfly, 
Pretty, cunning, and so shy; 
And her Pa says, 
And her Ma says, 
We may marry, bye and bye. 
[Dance—Tra-la-la. 
They Borrow, But Never Return.

Price 10 cents. 
As Sung by the For SISTERS. 
As we pass, day by day, thro' life's busy highway, 
There are many strange people we see ; 
And the worst, I 
conclude, are the ones who intrude 
On our charity, be it so free. 
For they seem to depend upon what we will lend, 
Not a 
dollar they honestly earn ; 
Yet they prosper and thrive, and the way survive 
Is, to borrow and never return ! 
CHORLI. 
Yes, they borrow but never return, 
So of course it is easy to learn, 
There are some folks that live, not to spend or to give, 
But to borrow and never return ! 
If you lay up in store a 
few dollars or more. 
Upon this you can truly depend. 
They will sure find it out, and they'll chase you about, 
Till they force you ,) our money to lend. 
If you doubtingly say, ' I'm afraid you won't pay," 
Such ideas of course they will spurn ; 
And you'll find out some day, I 
am right when I 
say, 
That they borrow, but never return ! 
Yes, they boi row, &e. 
In the fashion they dress, and their manners express 
They have plenty to eat and to wear ; 
But they'd be in the shade if their bills were all paid 
And the poor-house would have them in care. 
'Tis no wonder they smile when they pass you in sty— 
It is better to beg than to earn ; 
While it's true, as a 
rule, they will deem you a 
fool, 
Whez they borrow, to never return! 
Yes, they borrow, ix.

H ARDING, 229 Bowery, N. Y. 
Sarah Smart is young and charming, 
Sarah Smart's the girl I 
love, 
Which I'm sure there is no harm in ; 
Though she thinks there is, by Jove! 
For, when first I 
courted Sarah, 
Very much afraid was she, 
And all the more I'd try to square her, 
All the more she'd round on me. 
And when playfully I 
squeez'd her 
Little hand in mine, she said, 
That such liberties displeased her, 
So I 
squeezed her waist instead, 
Of course she tried to get away, 
But J held her while she did say— 
CHORUS. 
John, dear John, now do give over, 
Johnny, how you frighten me; 
How I 
wish you'd sail the seas over— 
Will you give over and let me be ? 
I 
said I 
loved her to distraction, 
Spoke to her old crusty dad; 
Gave him every satisfaction 
As to how much money I 
had. 
He then gave me his permission, 
If I 
could, his child to wed : 
Still, she would not calmly listen 
To the loving words I 
said: 
But blushed and murmured, 
" 
Cheese it, Mister !" 
As I 
held her in my arms ; 
And if I 
but tried to kiss her, 
She was filled with dreadful qualms ; 
She'd wriggle in my arms and cry, 
0 
let me go or I 
shall die. 
John, dear John, dre.. 
At last, one evening I 
did meet her, 
In a 
quiet retired spot, 
And I 
with a 
kiss did greet her, 
Ere she'd time to tell me not. 
I 
then quickly did discover 
That she was not now afraid, 
When '1 
acted as her lover, 
Soon great progress I 
then made. 
Married lifechei.said she'd like it, 
She would gladly marry me ; 
So a 
bargain I 
did strike it, 
And my wife she'll shortly be. 
And since I've named the happy day, 
While I 
squeeze her, she will say— 
CHORUS .

"St. Patrick's Day in the Morning:" 
By Mem McAmiy. 
Sung by ED. SCULLY. 
The noisy streets are supremely green, 
And all the clans are in order ; 
A 
thousand waving flags are seen, 
And each has green for its border. 
Arrah ! But the land is all ablaze. 
The bells have sounded their warning, 
And the only tune the wide world plays 
Is " St. Patrick's Day in the Morning." 
Each lad appears all neatly dressed— 
No monarch ever was bolder— 
With a 
spray of shamrock in his breast 
And a 
sash thrown over his shoulder; 
And the lass she smiles upon the lad, 
And turns no more in her scorning, 
For she could'ut resist his suit, bedad, 
On " St, Patrick's Day in the Morning." 
Och ! sure, but the streets are a 
gala sight, 
The people are all so frisky! 
With here and there a 
bit of a 
fight, 
The result of a 
drop of whiskey! 
If Mike and Pat come out of a 
spat 
With eyes of their own adorning, 
Diva a 
bit do they care for that, 
On " St. Patrick's Day in the Morning." 
You may traverse the world from Northern main, 
To the line of the hot equator: 
You May go from Sahara's desert plain, 
To Vesuvius, close to the crater ; 
You are certain to find an Irishman there, 
If you come with never a 
warning. 
And he's sure to be humming the (Lading air 
Of " St. Patrick's day in the Morning !" 
But though you find him in distant parts, 
And whether at sea or on dry land, 
The tenderest spot in his heart of hearts 
Is reserved for the Emerald Island. 
The soil of his birth is his proudest boast, 
•And he'll give you a 
wack for a 
warning, 
If you fail to respond to his patriot boast 
Of " St. Patrick's Day in the Morning!"

OLD Uncle Pete got full, last night, 
Looking out the w

This is the story he told me 
All about the animals he did see :— 
Skunk on de wall, blowin' his nose, 
Toads in de grass, wore soldier's new clothes ; 
Ducks and gander, and de ole gray mag, 
Playing on de pianer, " Rally roun' de Flag." 
CHORUS. 
Hop along, Peter, hop along, hop along, 
Hop along, Peter, whar you gwine, 
Hop along, Peter, hop along, hop along. 
Owl in de tree, winking and blinking, 
Cats in the pantry, catching mice; 
Bugs in de attic, playing poker, 
Spider on a 
cobweb, throwiu' dice. 
Pigs rehearsing in de swill-tub, 
Ducks in de river, tellin' lies ; 
Bull- frog on de stump, grabbing ' skeeters, 
Bald-headed June bug coaxing flies. 
Grasshopper in de barn, singing soprano, 
Big bull-frog singing bass; 
Elephant on de wall, out serenadin', 
Little brown weasel wid a

" 
en ingenious little book of the thaumaturgic order, has been sent nit; 
called ' Humpav DUMPTY,' and bound in such a 
way as to give oppottn• 
nity for a 
decidedly puzzling trick. 
While presenting the ordinary ap. 
pearance of a 
child's picture book, gaily printed and colored, it is af, 
bound that a 
practised manipulator taking it up and flirting tha leaves 
over, can make it appear to be filled only with one picture, or with blank 
pages, or with any one of quite a 
succession of figures. 
One minute the 
pamphlet, quickly thumbed, appears to contain nothing but the portrait 
of Harlequin, in his tesselated suit ; the next only Columbine, then 
nothing but Pantaloon, or Riding Hood, or MephistoPhiles. A little 
practice, and the directions printed with the book will make anybody 
at home in the handling of it."— Phil. Eve. Bull

Courting- Cards.—This Series of Cards has been arranged 
to meet a 
want fiequently felt by young people—a want of means of 
expressing one's sentiments in such a way as to be non-committaL 
Many young ladies are visited by gentlemen who are either too diffi. 
dent or too tearful of a 
repulse, to venture upon asking the momentous 
question. 
The lady is restrained, by custom and a 
sense of propriety, 
from do!ng anything that would seem to be an unlady-like encourage-
ment. 
As a 
result of this dilemma, many 
lives are spent as an unloved 
tedious existence, which might have been prolonged and enjoyed in the 
happiness of matrimony. 
This pack of Cards will overcome the diffi-
culty, and being in the shape of questions and answers, will cover every 
phase of courtship. 
The sentiments conveyed therein need not be 
adopted by the parties to the game as their own, unless it accords with 
the state of their affections, which fact makes further explanation un-
necessary. 
The playing of these Cards is not restricted to two players, 
I but may be enjoyed by evening parties
