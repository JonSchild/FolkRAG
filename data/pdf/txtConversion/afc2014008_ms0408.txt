Dear George,
 
The enclosed paper may s
eem at first just another bunch of academic verbiage.
 
But if you take heart and plow along, you might find yourself very moved by
 
the ending.  Anyway, I Was, and I think you might find it all worth your time.
 
Love,
 
Bess Lomax Hawes
 
Director
 
Polk Arts Program
 
P
.S.  From a perspective of no knowledge whatever about your daily activities,
 
could I offer a word of advice?  Don't let Glenn do all the field work.  Be's
 
good, but so are you and you need it as much as he does.

BL:  Administrative bads for Panel Contracts
 
As of Juno 20, 1980 the Folk Arts Program has $3,432 reminaing in 2380/Panel
 
Contracts.  Please note the attached deobligation for TA 0719 dated March 17tH
 
which totals $970.  We would also like to transfer $360 from 2524/Training into
 
2580/Panel Contracts.  These additions would bring our balance to $4,753 to cover
 
expenses for our panel chaisaaa to attend the August Council meeting and costs
 
of our fourth and final panel meeting to be geld September 5-6 in Santa Fe,
 
New Mexico.  We estimate that the August Council will cost $1,055 and the
 
September meeting will cost $8,200, putting us in the hole by S4,502.  Funds
 
allocated to panel contracts have been used solely for panelists attending
 
either c
ouncil meetings or panel meetings, and
, no additional or v
iascheeduled
 
meetings have been held.  We are now requesting $
4,502 to cower expenses
 
for our chairman's travel and our fourth gavel meeting.
 
As long as we are on the subject of our planned September  panel meeting - we
 
are in the process of confirming reservations for the s
leeting facilities at
 
St. John's college and San it de Fonzo.  To date we expect costs for two days
 
to be a total of $250.  The only other expense anticipated is rental fees for
 
vans to transport staff and panel to the meeting locations.  The number of
 
staff  to attend will be held to 5
.  Please let me know, if you  foresee any
 
problems with these plank.

Dear Mr. Welsh:
 
John Altman has asked me to conti
nent on the appropriateness
 
of his recent film,  "They Tell It For the Truth" for scheduling
 
on PTV-1.
 I should normally be d
teliahted to give a
ny views
 
on the matter, but it seems inappropriate for an official
 
of a granting agency to make such comments.
 I am sure that
 
you readily can find other sources of opinion on the matter.
 
Cordially,

Dear Ted,
 
Alan just sent me a copy of your remarks when you took .
day Ruby et al
 
on at the Flaherty whatever-it-was . It made me feel very pro m --
not just to know you, but to have been (
so they say) in the audience
 
when yet another defence of human dignity and yet another affirmation
 
of the possibility of human understanding were laid out for thettaking.
 
I
 wish I had really been there.
 
Yesterday a Kiowa gentleman cane to see n
ee.  I took my ritual three long
 
breaths and tried to slow down ; I reminded myself not to say uh-huh all the
 
time (
as I do with most people ,
 being incorrigably encouraging); and I
 
composed myself to just sit still and t
rait . He turned out t
o be more
 
brisk than I had sspected, a gentleman in his fifties with considerable
 
experience with the BIA ,
 an Indian bureaucrat of about my  age and degr*e
 
of sophistication . We had soma business to do ,
 but all through it he
 
kept on t
alking to us about Mooney.  I
le had just been over to the
 
Smithsonian and looked at some of Mooney 's old stuff, and he had been
 
terribly moved.  His grandfather had, he said, taken ?
looney in, made
 
him welcome, helped his learn.  Without Mooney we wouldn't know really
 
all that much about ourselves ,
 he said.
 
I finally asked him i
f he tbought that going to college had alienated
 
him from Kiowa-news . No
, he said ,
 it made no wore Klass.  I learned to
 
value what it was that made us special because it vasn't there when I
 
learned about other people . But that Mooney wan, he did a hard job...
 
The National Endowment for the Arts through its Policy and Planning
 
Committee of the National Council hex recently announced that the
 
preservation of `alternative aesthetic syste m" is one of its important
 
goals . This is startling n
ews indeed . I think I will circulate a copy
 
of your speech around the Endosmsot.  I hope you won't mind; I think
 
it will help.
 
Affectionately and admiringly,

Subject:  Attached fire-broather
 
I beliove we discussed this the other day.  Dick Shea writes a mighty
 
forthright letter.  I have checked the situation out with my old fri e
nd
 
Jim Griffith who is working in the Tucson area; Jim saps he is sure that
 
everything Dick said is true but that the letter will probably ultimately
 
do more harm than good to the cause of folk arts in Arizona.  The response
 
so far has been totally defenaive.
 
Anyway, you said you'd like to see it.

I believe we discussed this the other day.  Dick Shea writes a mighty
 
forthright letter.  I have checked the situation out with my old friend
 
Jim Griffith who is working in the Tucson area; Jim says he is sure that
 
everything Dick said is true but that the letter will probably ultimately
 
do more harm than good to the cause of folk arts in Arizona.  The response
 
so far has been totally defensive.

Tear Peter:
 
I write to tell you that at its last meeting the Polk Arts Advisory Panel
 
engaged in a thorough review of the history of the Oregon state folk arts
 
program.  As you know, the Panel supported the position of the Oregon
 
Folk Arts Coordinator for an almost unprecedented three years; this was
 
entirely due to they great respect they had for the quality of the work
 
produced each year with our grant funds.  The several local festivals,
 
the associated books and pamphlets, the photegcaphic survey of Oregon
 
traditional crafts, and finally the splendid epnibit, soon to be mounted
 
i
n the prestigious Smithsonian Instituttsm's Rennvick Museum were testimony
 
to the effectiveness of the Folk Arts coordinator's efforts and to the
 
support she received from your office.
 
Rose of the panel members, however, -- all experienced scholars in the
 
field -- believes that the projects you
, have already completed have ex-
hausted the folk arts resources of your magnificent state.  The work d
erma
 
so far is simply a sampling of the cultural richness available in Oregon.
 
Although we c oot longer continue our funding support for the salary of a
 
folk arts specialist, we stand ready to give federal assistance to additional
 
folk arts projects of equivalent quality in your state.  Please let us
 
know hone we may be of assistance.
 
Cordially,
 
Bess Lomax Hawes
 
Director

 I concur with Bess that this has to be caret

honestly weighed, and then either let's go with it of let us stay out of it.
 
In short,  I know that none of us can be all things to all people.
 Similarly,
 
I know that the Endowment must deliberately select out certain principles
 
and priorities and.then pursue those goals.
 Otherwise
:, we dissipate
. our
 
identities as well as our funds.
 Otherwise, we become a bowl of mush,
 
easily flushed down the drain without anyone caring or noticing  (if I am not
 
being too careless with my metaphor).

Dear Ms. White,
 
I an happy that you were able to arrange a meeting; with Elisabeth Dear,
 
and that her visit was helpful.  I have already asked that a copy of our
 
application forms be sent you, but r
 shall enclose another one with this
 
note.  The mails have been extremely unreliable recently, and I want to
 
be sure that at least one form gets through to you.
 
We look forward to receiving an application for a "Celebration of Navajo
 
Folk Arta".  Please don't hesitate to get in touch with me or any of the
 
Folk Arts staff if you have any problems with the forces or reed additional
 
information.  You could either write or telephone person-to-person
 
collect on 202/634-4282, and your call will be returned on the
y federal line
 
at no cost to you.

Near Bill,
 
In response to yours of the 15th, have you turned bureaucrat on me, r
ay
 
deal old pal?  Unless my mind fails me, we discussed the problem with
 
that application at the start:  it was an UEH style conference with
 
little emphasis on performance and it concerned a topic of secondary
 
priority to the Tolk Arts panel.  Lastly, we are in a fiscal squeeze;
 
we had to go back and cat out $
175,000 worth of perfectly good projects,
 
including yours, in order to leave
e enoufh money for our final deadline
 
of the year.  The panel wished the conference well but Just didn't think
 
it addressed our pri mry concerns in a year of fiscal stringency.
 
You don't need any instructions in "improving your applications".  You're
 
the all-time champion money-raiser I k
now for pity's sakes.  One of these
 
days I
'm going to offer you a contract to go around and explain to the
 
folks how to raise the necessary scratch; you're an e
imert.
 
I hope the conference went swimmingly.  I know lots of people who went
 
but Uav m lt sat still long enough to get in a good gossip about your
 
latest triumph.  Please keep in touch.
 
Affectionately, but irritatedly

Dear Charles and Donna,
 
Thank you very much for the kind invitation to attend the ground breaking
 
ceremony for Appalshop`s new hose.  The Folk

excitement at the prospect of moving into new and more ample quarters
 
and applauds the efforts you have made in developing all the Appalshop
 
programs.
 
unfortunately, the spring meeting of the National Council on the Arts
 
falls on the very s
ame day as your celebration, and thus none of the staff
 
will be able to attend.  While we may not be able to be with you in person,
 
we certainly will all be with you in spirit!
 
Thank you again for the invitation, and our heartiest congra

How is your spring coming along? We
've not stopped for breath here and
 
the suanar bids fair to be equally energetic.
 
I
'm a bit concerned about the fact that we are still holding on to your
 
application for a Fol}c
 Arts program . I wonder if the best t
hing to do
 
mightn't be for you to withdraw it pending the action of >  on the
 
application from the Rhode Island Ruranities folks.  This would allow t
he
 
two of us more time to get together for a planning meeting
,, and at the
 
sams time clear our books for this fiscal year.  Polk Arta is a bit hard-
pressed for cash at this point and needs every nickel we can squeeze out
 
of our budget; at the same time, I naturally long to see a healthy folk
 
arts program developed!
 is Rhode Island and right now feel obligated to
 
bang on to sole money to s
end your way...
 
Sally Terkovich tells ne that staff response to the Rhode Island Humanities
 
application is very positive, and she has great hopes for its success.
 
It would be really nice if we could coordinate a state-wide program
 
between the two agencies right f
a
.
 the beginning rather than cobble i
t
 
together later as we usually have to do.
 
Anyway think about it, and give m
en a call s ~

Dear '
Mr. Vol
.fsohn-
7 enjoyed our weetinr
, of last month anet regret that it has taken me so
 
long to follow up on our discussion.
 
As you recall, the Folk Arts Advisory panel did not feel that the revised
 
plans developed by Columbia Colleere to Imp1 cent Crant 92-5531-171 fell
 
within program guidelines.  You and I therefore agreed that the only
 
solutions were for Columbia College to decline the grant, or for the Folk
 
Arts Program to deobligate it.  The first alternative s
e3eox preferable,
 
and I could appreciate a letter from vett to that effect.  Since our fiscal
 
year ends in September, it would be good to hear from you within the next
 
month, allowing us plenty of t1me to clear the hooks.
 
I hope you will gear in mind that this action will in no way affect
 
further relationships between Columbia College and this or any other
 
pror
,
;rar within the Arts Endow mnt.  I
le loot
/ forward to the possibility
 
of our doing business together in future.

Dear Nora:
 
I first must apologize for n
ay long silence,  I have been waiting for the
 
rules governing the f
ederal hiring freeze to clarify, but we are still
 
a hit i
n the dark.  However, whatever happens about that, I have decided
 
that we must stick with the original ordering; of our priorities and select
 
(
if and when we can) someone with background in anthropology and special
 
experience in l
ative American arts.
 
I
 hope you will a
llow me, however, to keep your resume on f
ile f
or future
 
consideration in case we have another opening.  I
'd also like to feel free
 
t
o call on you for occasional s
ite visits and consulting work.  People
 
with your qualifications are quite special; I
`m only sorry they do not
 
f
it our particular needs a
t this p
articular time.  Perhaps it will all
 
work out for t
he best i
n the long run.  This job would have wade i
t
 
awfully hard for you t
o f
inish your dissertation.
 
I did enjoy greatly our meeting, and I feel still in your debt f
or responding
 
on such s

t was awfully kind
 
of you.  May I
 wish you all success vith Your dissertation and your worts

I am in receipt of the copy you sent us of your application to the Museums
 
Prograse at the National Pnaiowment for the Arts.  As I inagine the Museums
 
Program has informed you by now, the Arts Endowment cannot fund the U.S.
 
Pepartr
sent of the Interior.  The Folk Arts Program has occasionally funded
 
activities in the
, traditional arts that occur on National Park Service land
 
but that are sponsored by other organisations.  I shall enclose an informational
 
brochure about the folk Arts Prorram that explains our program.  I hope
 
you'll find it useful

You might also wish to get in touch vIth Joe Wilson at the National
. Council
 
on the Traditional Arta.  Mr. T
?ilson has a contract with the National Parts
 
Service that allows him to make occasional site visits to discuss the
 
development of local traditional arts activities within particular federal
 
parks.  If you would like to consult with Mr. Wilson, you could reach  hiss
 
at 1346 Connecticut Ave., N.V., Vaxbington. t

Another idea that occurs to r
ue is that the Folk Arts panel chairman, Roger
 
Welsch, will be visiting South Dakota towards the end of the summer.  He
 
is an experienced folklorist at the University of Nebraska and has many
 
friends among the various Plains tribes.  I would be ha
apP9 to have hire
 
stop by to meet both with you and your staff and the appropriate repre--
sentatives.of the Oglala Sioux if you think that would b
e helpful.
 
Should you wish to discuss these or other issues with su
e, please don't
 
hesitate to write again or you can telephone s
ae direct person-to-person
 
collect at 202-634-4282, and I will return your call on the federal line.

in getting '

I

the Endowment publications, and also vent a copy to }
dank Willett as he
 
requested.  I hope this circulation is all right with you- they are all
 
honorable people and will get in touch with you if any kind of publication
 
possibility emerges.
 
It was lovely to see you again after all these years.  Please tape good
 
care of yourself; you are a rare spirit and we need you active and
 
energetic and inspiring us all.  Alan gill continue to pursue the television

Dear Hank,
 
just a hasty note to thank you and pour hard-working associates, not to
 
w
Amtion s
ay old friend, Zak, for your hospitality last weekend.  You ran
 
the conference beautifully and with great aplomb.  I hope you're feeling
 
appropriately successful.  I think it was a stirring event and one that
 
bodes fair for eves sore interesting developueuts in folk arts in Alabama.
 
Alan and I had a pleasant evening and morning in .
Joe Wheeler State Park,
 
thanks to your good offices.  The rain cooled my ideas about hiking
 
throuRb the woods, but we holed up costly and caught up or our sleep and
 
our conversations.  During Monday afternoon, we explored the four cities
 
area, and I finally flew out of Muscle Shoals in the evening, leaving
 
Alan with the intention of calling an Bill
. Foster and then making his way
 
back to Livingston.  He was still thinking about going by Tuscaloosa,
 
though, so don't be surprised to see hiss turning up most anywhere in the
 
state.
 
Please, by the way, don't worry about my expenses.  The Endotment was
 
delighted, I hope, to take care of my  visit and it was really rewarding.
 
There is nothing; that bents seeing whatever it is in person; I always
 
learn lots on s
ay trips away from H.C. and I carne back with many new ideas
 
to chew on.
 
Thanks again for all your courtesy, and please especlall
.q Pass my cOm plisaents
 
along to Reba.  She was lovely to all the conferees and a great help to
 
us all.

P.S.  I don't remenber whether we aroke of this or not, but I was such
 
interestdd by what our black quartet expert told me about the existence
 
of "trainers'" who used to coach quartets in the old days.  It see m to
 
me that, if any could be located In Alabama, this s
light be a
 
rArvellous AIS project
 t
hey could work: at Tuskegee maybe or in
 
mostly black high schools and tain up a whole bunch of new young
 
quartets.  I an sure the Polk Arts panel would be interested
 
in this if you could get anything going.  Just think it over anyway...

time and we could chat about it further, if you like.
 
It was also so mice of you to arrange that pleasant reunion with my
 
previously unlnown frjends on the Metro Arts Council.  It was a perfectly
 
lovely visit.  I hope I was able to help a bit with getting the Omaha and
 
the Lincoln folks back together.  Thera are so navy interesting things to
 
be done , it would be a shame for risunderstandings to get in the way of

It was a most pleasant trip.  I was rather tired by then , and I doubt
 
my conversation was scintillating*, but I hope I vats able to help out some.

 I was totally puzzled by your reference to the Arts Council's
 
belief that folk artists live in "canes" until T thought about Roster's

I hope you'll keels me informed how things develop in Nebraoka.  And
 
please let r
ye know , too, if you think another trip night be useful:
 
I could a
lvA7s coupe visit another time . I tried hard with both the
 
W ho and the Lincoln folks to smooth over some of the tensions; it
 
just isn 't productive to keep quarrels alive indefinitel7.  Either everybody
 
ought to shake and make up, or the issue should be f
aced downs and fought out.
 
I can go either way.  Let me know ghat you think , once the dust settles.
 
Keep up the good work.

Dear Mr. Jones:
 
Just a hasty note to thank you again for your cordiality when we met in
 
Omaha last week:.  I enjoyed our conversation and hope the meeting was
 
fruitful for you as well.  I made a mental note that the Rebrask
ua Arts
 
Council had not received coFies of the Folk Arts brochure or ruidelives
 
for 1980 and am sending a few along to you under separate cover.  Please
 
don't hesitate to get in touch with us at 202-534-4282 if you need more.
 
When the 1981 edition comes out next fall, I shall see to it that we
 
wend them out your way directly rather than trusting to the Endowment's
 
mail office.
 
I hope you will convey s
py regrets to Robin Tryloff that I managed to miss
 
her and my hones that she g
r
ill drop by and call on the Folk Arts Program

Dear Fancy Timmins:
 
As I drove down from Omaha to Lincoln after our recent lunch party, I
 
kept thinking about the question you asked me -- w
lr
.at do folklorists do?--
and I decided that I hadn't answered you very well . Let me try again.
 
I
r
e terms of arts activities , folklorists are really art critics.  Like
 
other critics, some of them write, some of them do research , some of
 
then teach.  Tike other critics (
e.g. music critics w
t-;
o way be expert in
 
opera or ir.
 18th century chamber music or Moog synthesizers) some ofolklorists
 
are expert in Russian-German
, Mennonite =sic ,
 or Ukrantan crafts or the
 
Hispanic fold-
 drarsas of northern New Mexico.  Still , again like other
 
critics , they are ex-neeted to be sufficiently conversant with their general
 
f
ield t
hat they can either ask* critical Juds
!Aents themselves or know
 
another expert better qualified to do so.  And their field is a
ll the art
 
forms of all the peoples in the world whose traditional arts have not been
:
 
►
e
e
s
.�
 s
eacl prosaoted by tho major institutions, profit or non-profit.
 
You probably noticed the Nord "traditional" in the last sentence.  W e
 
important ,
 because the field of folklore is so incredibly broad anyway.
 
We have to have some way to narrow it dowse ,
 so, although every one of us
 
is aware of individual artists who are Nork
.inr out creative variations on
 
well-worn therles ,
 we
, tend to look for our bread and-tsutter constituency
 
t
o those artists who would be called "classic" if they had only had had the
 
g
ood f
ortune to be easel painters or symphonic composers.  I wrote a whole
 
book about one of these traditional artists and didn't even scratch the
 
surface . I
'm sending the B
,arteks a copy . :
M
aybe they 'll let you borrow I
t.
 
Anyway ,
 what a eood folklorist can .
lo for You is to help to keep your
 
standards hi
.gb when: you venture outside the well-known paths of "high art"
 
music or painting or dance . If You are dealing with, any, a Polish community,
 
i
t helps t
o have a knowledgable person around who knows what kinds of
 
songs they might be able to sing, what the names of their instruments are,
 
what the designs on their painted eggs mean ,
 whether or not they might do
 
paper cut-outs and if no , i
f your paper-cutter i
s produclnf innovative
 
patterns;
 or following the designs of a particular region of Poland. These
 
folklorists are particular kinds of jqp rts, Nancy, and though admittedly
 
they can't know evervthinlr about everything, they are ,
 or -
s
hould be, expert
 
in finding out.  '
that `s what their training amounts to, and that is why
 
2
 
i
 
they get insulted when their expwrtise i
s overlooked or denigrated.  The
 
best ones -
-- and you have a "
beet o
ne" i
n y
our a
wn state -
-
- care deeply
 
about what they do, and know, and the unused and unknown people they try
 
to represent.  This i
s why they get argumentative and intransigent and
 
downright rude every once in a while.  I
t's a passionate f
ield, and I
,
 
for one, hope it always remains so.
 
I hope you will share this letter with Gloria.  I wrote her a bread-and-
butter letter which was heart-felt but which didn't raise any of the
 
issues I
've discussed here.  But both the letters are to both of you.
 
Please think some more about the radio i
deas we were discussi
.np.  I
 
t
hink
. an Omaha arts series could be smashing.
 
Yours always,

Dear :
tike,
 
Just a note to thank you for the extremely thorough and informative final
 
descriptive report on the restival des Duey Mondes.  I
'd also like to
 
congratulate you and the Vermont Arts Council on bringing the whole project
 
off in such obviously fine style for a second year.
 
It's too bad the tour is at an end, but I can quite seep that other activities
 
voul
.d take precedence.  Possibly in a year or so you'll see some of the
 
seeds that you've shown via the tour sprouting up in terms of locally l
eased
 
franca-Anerican cultural activities, dances, fetes, and the like.
 
You might also be interested to hear that the tour in a w
ary. Isn't over,
 
though it will go on on a different geographic basis; we're working right
 
now with the National
. Council on the Traditional Arts who are interested
 
in sponsoring a Franco-American tour for 1981 to f
ait French-speaking
 
co  unities in Missouri, Arkansas, and Louisiana.  They hope to include
 
musicians and :
lancers from New England, though the loss of Louis Beaudoin
 
is a sad blow.
 
Ant v
aay. thanks again for your useful a
ard helpful report.  We values such
 
documents, as they point up difficulties and discoveries that can keto
 
us from repeating the same mistakes and focus us on now ideas.  Please
 
let us hear from you when there is s
ense nets folk arts g
assiness in Vermont.

To:  Par

From:  Bess Lomax Raves (

Subject:  Information for congressional hearings
 
As always, I must begin with the ritual remark, "Polk Arts is d
ffferent
 
fror the other programs".  In utilizing the attached info, please note
 
the following particular differences:
 
1
)  We have not spent all our 1980 money yet; we have approximately
 
34  of our 1980 allocation to obligate at Polk Arts June panel meeting.
 
We will give you real figures; if you want, multiply by 150; for the
 
entire 1980 year.
 
2
)  Since most of our grants are for support of one-shot projects
 
ranging from films to specific events, site visits generally follow t

awarding of grants rather than preceding them.  Thus, though staff often
 
make technical assistance visits in order to help develop good applications,
 
our panelists and other consultants generally go forth to evaluate the
 
worth of projects that we have already funded.
 
Therefore, comparing our site visits with the total number of grants
 
awarded or applications received per fiscal year is relatively meaningless,
 
since the site visit may occur the fiscal year after the project has been
 
funded.

of course, program  money, not administrative funds.

grants, rather than applicant and grantee organizations, in keeping with
 
our project support type of funding.
 
Keeping all of this in mind, this is what we have come up with:
 
Site visits
  
1980 Total to date
 
47 (
25 by staff, 2
.
2 by consultants through contract), representing
 
about 20% of our applications to date and about 32% of our
 
grants to date.

1979 Totals 
7
4 (
25 by staff and 49 by consultants through contract), representing
 
about 181 of our applications and about 357 of our total grants.
 
(
Since moee of our events funded take place during the late Spring and
 
Summer than any other time of the year, our percentage of grantees visited
 
in all of fiscal 1980, particularly by staff, will probably turn out to be
 
significantly greater than the percentage to date and the total percentage
 
of fiscal 1979.)
 
Equipment Purchases
  
Since this time last year, we have purchased a self-contained, mobile
 
sound unit, consisting of two tape recorders (
cassette and reel-to-reel),
 
turntable, amplifier/tuner, two speakers, two headphones, and lockable
 
mobile cabinet for use in application review.  Total cost $
2,347.44.
 
The sound equipment (
$1,387.19) was purchased on July 7
, 1979, and the
 
security cabinet (
$460,25) on April 3
, 1
.
930.
 
Rejected or Reduced Past Grantees
  
Since we mainly give support for specific projects rather than general
 
or organizational support, a year-to-year comparison of funding for any
 
given application organization would not be very meaningful.
 
First-Time Grantees
  
To date in fiscal 1980, we have funded 38 first-time grantees.
 
Seventeen of these are apprentice fellowships, which are intended to be
 
one-time only grants.

Subject:  Polk Arts Council Pa%aes (
May meeting)
 
Thanks very much for your careful scrutiny of our council pages.  It's
 
a relief to know that someone else takes a good look at them.
 
1
)  The Creek "picnic" is a simple issue.  l
ie'll simply call it an "ethnic
 
celebration" which is what it is in our terns.
 
2
)  The fatter-son apprenticeship issue i
s trickier, as you said.  We've
 
funded such situations twice before, but nobody noticed.  So far, the panel
 
has evolved no policy on the issue, preferring to treat each case on its
 
ema merits.
 
How would you feel about the following paragraph as an insert at the
 
bep
,inninf
: of the apprenticeship category?
 
four of the following recommended awards -- Carshallo,
 
Molina--Morales, Negro-Rios, Rosario -- vere brought to the
 
attention of the Polk Arts panel by Sr. Walter Murray-Chiesa,
 
director of the Office of Crafts Development, Administracion
 
de Fomento F
,conomico, and widely recognized as the leading
 
crafts expert of Puerto Rico.  Sr. Murray--Chiesa selected these
 
craftsmen personally from hundreds in his files as exemplary
 
artists for whom economic incentives and assistance was
 
crucial in order that they might be encouraged to tape time
 
to instruct apprentices.  A further important aspect of these
 
awards is the reinforcement provided by federal recognition;
 
many young people in Puerto Rico do not learn traditional crafts
 
because they do not see them as economically viable.  Sr. Murray-
Chiesa made a particular effort to locate possible father-son
 
combinations in order to reinforce the family crafts tradition
 
in Puerto Rico; each apprentice applicant already knows the basics
 
of the craft but each is at an ape vhesre a
. serious career co mmitment
 
t
rust be made.  It is hoped these small awards will provide the
 
incentive to help keep these endangered family-based crafts alive.

Dear
 
I dislike troubling you between panel meetings, since we lay so very much
 
on you when you meet in Washington, but I do have a few business items to
 
take up.  Please accept my apologies for disturbing such peace as you're
 
able to maintain.
 
First.
 I need to be sure that everyone is aware of the panel meeting
 
dates for the rest of this calendar year.  They are:
 
June 12-14 Washington, D
.C.
 
September 5-6  Santa Fe, New Mexico
 
December 7-9  Washington, D
.C.  (
changed so as not
 
to interfere with the AAA meeting in D
.C. the weekend previous).
 
Would you please indicate those meeting dates when you now know you can or
 
cannot be with us and return in the enclosed envelope?  I
'll try to fill in
 
any gaps that may show.
 
Second.  You may remember that you voted on and approved the establishment
 
of a "nominated fellowship" category for our 1981 guidelines.  The language
 
agreed upon at our December meeting is as follows:
 
The Folk Arts Program further announces a pilot category of
 
nominated fellowships in 1981.  Many of our most significant
 
and influential folk and traditional artists go unrecognized
 
by the larger community and unrepaid for their contributions
 
to the health and happiness of the nation and of the arts.
 
Because of this, the Folk Arts Program is introducing this
 
special category.
 
Fellowships will be awarded on a one-time only basis to exemplary
 
master artists and artisans whose names have been recommended to the
 
Folk Arts Panel.  Up to twenty-five such awards, in the amount of
 
$1,000 each, will be recommended by the Folk Arts Panel in 1981.
 
- 2 -
 
Nominations may be made by sending a letter to the Folk Arts
 
Program.  The letter should detail the career of the artist
 
nominated and explain why you feel that he or she should receive
 
national recognition through a fellowship award.
 It should
 
include as much documentation as possible as to the expertise
 
of the individual being considered and the traditional art form
 
represented.  The deadline for 1981 nominations i
s June 1
, 1981;
 
awards will be announced during December of that same year."
 
This was presented to the National Council for approval along with the other
 
proposed changes in the 1981 guidelines.  Everything was just dandy with
 
the Council except for the nominated fellowships idea which they referred
 
t
o the Council's Policy and Planning Committee for more detailed discussion.
 
I have just met with the Committee.  They felt that the idea was fine, but
 
the title troubled them.  They felt that the term "fellowship" should be
 
reserved for genuine periods of support for an individual artist to do his
 
thing; they also were concerned that the exact nature of our idea was not
 
expressed by the bureaucratic title we had used.
 In short, they recommended
 
that we call the program "Folk Arts Heritage Awards".  No other changes in
 
the wording above were recommended.
 
The staff here finds the title change acceptable, but wants to be sure that
 
you do.  We also feel that it puts a slightly different complexion.on the
 
idea, clarifying, to the point of perhaps striking terror into your hearts,
 
just what we're doing here.  Do you want to be in the award-giving business
 
(
even if the candidates are nominated)?  We're game if you are, but I do
 
think we should get a vote on it.
 
So, would you please indicate your sentiments on the enclosed sheet, and
 
write any other comments you might have, and return it post haste?  We
 
should re-discuss this at the next Council meeting, which will occur in May,
 
prior to our next panel meeting; otherwise, I wouldn't trouble you with a
 
mailed ballot.
 If you'd rather discuss the issues involved with me or
 
any other staff member personally, you can, of course, call, and we'll
 
get right back to you.
 
Thanks, again and always, for all your help and counsel.
 
Affectionately,

Dear Nancy,
 
.
rust a note to thank you for your thorough and helpful report on your
 
discussion with Ms. Martin of the Akron American Indian Center.  It surely
 
is hard to know what to advise on such projects, isn't it?  I completely
 
agreed with you that i
t seems unlikely that the panel will support such
 
a large amount for a first-time effort; yet I can understand perfectly why
 
they want to start with a big bang.  What to do?
 
The undiscoverable question (
until after we've tried it) is whether or not
 
they are well enough organized to put on a festival that lasts that long
 
and costs that much.  It's a big Job, and I
've written them suggesting that
 
they might consider cutting the festival to two days or otherwise limiting
 
its scope.  Anyway, it'a up to them now, but I really appreciate the time
 
you put into working this one over.
 
Ob, and thank you also for forwarding along the proposal from the pubb-Bubhs.
 
I am forwarding it to our panel chairman, Professor Welsch, for response
 
and co=aent.  If the June panel book weighs is at less than a ton, perhaps
 
we can get this worthy project iu for a group decision.
 
Love,

Dear Mr. Hosick,
 
I an sorry to have taken so long in getting back to you.  We've had several

I a
xe enclosing
, a copy of the Volk Arts program guidelines for use in
 
applying to us for your arts festival project.  April first (
translation:
 
first week of April) is our next deadline.  Powever, I don't see any
 
indication of exactly when you plan to hold the festival.  If it will be
 
held next spring, I would reco
:
end that you delay your application until
 
our October 1 deadline, when we will
. have 1
981 monies to allocate.  Our
 
April deadline will see the last of our 1980 funds; the competition will
 
be especially keen and there is no f
lexibility -- once we've emptied the
 
pot, it will be all gone.
 
I have also examined your budget with great interest besides reading
 
Dr. Nancy Lurie's extremely supportive report on her discussion with No.
 
Joan Martin of your center.  It seers to me that your budget is well worked
 
out, and I understand entirely your rationale for wanting to start off vith
 
a "big oh m".  However, I must tell you that your chances would be enormously
 
improved if you could see your way to a more modest request.  Our funds are
 
short, and the Folk Arts advisory panel is generally reluctant to fund first_
 
tine-ever projects heavily.  Start--up monies are invariably bard to get
 
asyvay; our panel wrestles with the problem at almost every meeting.  One  
Nay to economise might be to cut the length of your proposed festival; a
 
three day program is quite ambitious for a first--time effort.  Or perhaps
 
you can find local resources that you are not currently aware of.
 
No matter what you decide, if I can be of any further assistance, please
 
don't hesitate to write again or to call, person-toy-person collect at
 
202-634-4282 and I
 Will return your call on the federal line.

Dear Dr. Burn,
 
'
thank you for your letter.  I must apologize, as I have had to in all of
 
s
ty correspondence this past month, for the long, delay in responding.  Our
 
Program has been so short-staffed, that we have fallen inexcusably far
 
behind with day-to-clay business.
 
I am enclosing a copy of the Folk Arts guidelines for your information and
 
use, when you feel your plans have developed far enough that you are
 
ready to apply.  I must tell you that the Folk Arts advisory panel has
 
always been reluctant to initiate large-scale projects.  Start-up monies
 
are always the most difficult to obtain, and our budget is so limited
 
that we o
ast be conservative, especially in the area of assisting with
 
the acquisition of permanent collections.
 
After looking through our guidelines, you might wish to consider consulting
 
with Vank Willett, the folk arts coordinator at the Alabama Arts Council.
 
He at one time worked as an intern in the Folk Arts Progran and knows us
 
well.  Another possible avenue of support might be the Museu m Program at
 
the National Endowment for the Arts.  There is always the possibility of
 
co-funding; certainly there are parts of the project you suggest that would
 
fit well within the scone of the things we can help with,
 
please don't hesitate to get in touch with us again after your project and
 
budget are further developed.  We will of course need B
auch more information,
 
including vitas of any folk arts consultants you might plan to use, samples
 
of film, interview tapes, size and extent of the exhibit, personnel to be
 
involved and the like.  Please feel free to write again or if you have

Dear Mr. Rud'
jak
. and Ms. Szabo
 
Bob Teske has been called out of toom by a family emergency, so I a"
 
trying to take care of some of his accumulated mail.  I apologize for
 
the delay in answering your letter of enquiry.
 
I shall enclose a copy of the Folk Arts guidelines for your use in
 
preparing an application for our April first deadline.  I should caution
 
You, however, that your proposed request se
 emA exceptionally costly for
 
two one-day events that are largely of a social nature.  In fact, I can't
 
gee what extra costs would be involved except for instructors and artists
 
fees.  Perhaps it `
could be more economical to hold a series of individual
 
ethnic events -- p
icnice,dances, and the like -- where the participating
 
families could bring their own food for foodways d
em onstrations and we
 
could help support live music for the dancing.
 
I am sorry to sound so penny-pinching, but we are approaching the end of
 
our fiscal year and I dust tell you that our last panel was forced with
 
great regret to turn down $150,0nn worth of a
lready approved grants because
 
our funds are so limited.  I do believe, in view of our past record of support
 
of the International Institute, that a further grant request would have a
 
better chance of success if it were really tightly budgeted and economically
 
conceived.  We are just rurmins out of
. cash.
 
One further suggestion,  I think t
he panel will be extremely interested in
 
knowing which ethnic groups will be involved, which consultants invited,
 
and just what the products of the events will be.  In other words, a good
 
deal of back
:-up information would strengthen your application.  I shall, Of

Dear Mr. Frei
 
2 am sonevi,at at a loss to know just hov t
o answer in a useful manner your
 
letter of February 21.  The various i
deas you outline suggest our Museums
 
Program, our Design Arts Program (
formerly known as Architecture and
 
Fnvirarmental Arts) and the Crafts Program in Visual Arts among
.
, others.
 
The National Endowment for the Humanities in i
ts Education Programs has
 
supported some public information activities of the kind you describe in
 
your lecture series.  The Historic rreservation Program at the Department
 
of the Interior has also concerned itself with projects to protect, restore
 
and/or document historic buildings.
 
I &hall enclose the Guide to Progr 2s from the national Endow "nt for the
 
Arts.  This will give you a capsule description of the general types of
 
activities currently being supported here.  I shall also enclose a brochure
 
describing the work of the Folk Arts Program in t
reater detail.
 
I
'll also suggest two additional publications that might be of use.  You
 
could write to the American Folklife Center at the Library of Congress and
 
ask for a copy of their publication "Folklife and the Federal Government":
 
it is a bit out of date, having been published in 1
977 but it contains uuch
 
useful information, addresses. progra" description and the like.  There is
 
a modest fee charged per copy.  Finally, the Associated Council of the  
Arts has recently published a such larger guide entitled "Cultural nirectory:
 
Cuide to Federal Funds and Services for Cultural Activities".  The
: price
 
for this hefty and up to date publication is $
4.40 including postage and
 
handling; you car obtain it from ACA Publications, 1564 Broadway, New York,
 
New York
.  10036.
 
I do hope you don't think I an f
obbing you off in some bureaucratic ploy.
 
Your ideas seem worthy and interesting; the problem i
s to figure out which
 
i
dea f
its which possible funding source.
 
Yours sincerely.

April 1 and

).  I have, however, checked with a mmber of folk music authorities
 
who have worked in the '
4orfolk a
rea o
n both sides of the Chesapeake, and
 
they all expressed real doubts that the repertory of occupational sang
 
you are seeking is still alive.  My brother, in fact, worked with sore of
 
the menhadin fishermen in the forties and at that time found only a few
 
who still recalled even any of the old rowing songs.  I would recommend
 
that you subvit with your application some really solid evidence that your
 
researcher can have some chance of locating
* living traditional singers.
 
Otherwise, I as afraid our a

effort.

There seem to me t
o be several things to consider in answering the attached.
 
1
)  The Chairman might want to consider whether supporting this request
 
would involve him in the affairs of another federal agency.
 (
It's a pretty
 
benign project, though
., and night not bother him at all.)
 
2
)  Might he get a ton of similar requests for similar support?  There
 
are an awful lot of sites out there that people want to preserve.
 (
The ten
 
under consideration are certainly high quality and worth preserving, but
 
with a lot of such requests, Design Arts, Folk Arts, et al might be put on
 
the spot to figure out whether or not support would be desirable.  Still
 
and all, I don't believe in not doing something you really think should be
 
done for fear of opening "floodgates"; often they aren't there
..)
 
3
)  Would responding favorably to this request imply that the Endowment
 
would fund such projects?  I would think that (
assuming he wants to support
 
it) a sentence might be put in that would read something like:  "It is
 
hoped that the success of this nomination might strengthen the possibiiity
 
of attaining fiscal support for this project through the S
tate
. Historical
 
Preservation Commission or through the appropriate agency in the Department
 
of the Interior."
 
4
)  The Chairman might also want to be aware of the fact that Spaces
 
(
a California-based organization) has applied to the
. Special Projects Program
 
for funding to set up a newsletter and a sort of network support organization
 
for people interested in preserving this kind of site.
 (
The grant was
 
recommended by panel, at a lesser amount than requested, and will
. go to May
 
Council as far as I know.  This kind of grant i
s, in my view, as far as the
 
Endowment should go.  I don't think we should be involved in supporting
  
costs for peeservation projects.)
 
This is undoubtedly more than you ever wanted to know about this topic.  I
 
hope it helps.

Bear Yr. Ludwig,
 
Thank You very much for your interesting letter.
 
The tipi film eeems to r
ye a distinct possibility for Folk Arta funding, and
 
I shall enclose a copy of t
he program guidelines for your use in applying.
 
Our next deadline is April 1
; following that, we can handle only emergency
 
applications until the fall deadline of October 1
.
 
The wampum files Is more problematical. not so much because of the controversy
 
surrounding the topic as because of the treatment you seem to be planning.
 
We are an arts agency and our mission is to support artistic activities in
 
every way we can.  My suspicion i
s that our reviewing panel would feel that
 
your film will be a social/political/historical document, more suitable for
 
funding through the ?
rational Endowment for the Eutaanities than through us.
 
I do think a case could be made for the wampum belt being an artistic product
 
as well as a ceremonial and religious artifact, but I think your treatment
 
would have to s
tress that aspect, not simply the question of the pros and
 
cons of ownership.  And that right distort the f
ilm you have in mind.  You
 
might want, then, to enquire from the Humanities Media progrars at 806 15th
 
Street, N
.W., Washington, r
A
r
,  20506, and you might also try, the .
Arts
 
Endowment's ?
Media Arts Progrart where they are concerned  with film as an
 
art f
orc
e in and of itself and therefore aren't quite as picky about topic
 
and treatment as Folk Arts has to be.  I shall enclose a copy of their
 
guidelines for your use.
 
You've addressed several of the following i
ssues in the material you have
 
already sent in, but let me outline what you'll need to do when you decide
 
where and when you wish to apply.  With your f
illed out and signed appli-
cation. please send along a suggested treatment and a sketch of your
 
distribution plan.  Indications of support from Indian leaders would be
 
essential! support letters from cultural specialists such as anthropologists
 
etc. would be helpful.  t
o
te would later need a ten minute filra sample for
 
panel review.  Flan to have this reach us by May 15, and we will return i
t
 
within a month.  If you want to submit a completed full-length film as your
 
sample, please let us know which ten minute segment you would L
ike the
 
panel to see.

Dear Ms. Freund-Nelson,
 
Thank you for your Interesting letter.  I must apologize for the delay in
 
responding, but we have been so short-staffed lately that we have fallen
 
terribly behind in our conduct of business.
 
T enclose a copy of both the '
folk Arts and the Visual Arts guidelines for
 
your reference.  (
The Visual Arts Program includes a Crafts category for
 
the support of professional activities in handicrafts; it is possible that
 
some part of your proposed project might fit into their program.)  If
 
you decide to apply to Folk
. Arts, we would look carefully at whether or
 
not the teachers you select are themselves traditional artists as defined
 
and described in our guidelines.  We are a small program with limited funds
 
and have decided for this year and next to place our emphasis on supporting
 
those artists as artisans who come frog traditional com mnities (
e.g. Native
 
American tribes) and who have learned their art forks in traditional ways.
 
I hope the enclosed materials will help you determine for yourself to which
 
program and for which part of your activities you might best apply.  If
 
you need any further assistance, please write again, or telephone me or
 
my associate, Bob Teske, person to person collect at 2G?-534-42:2 and we
 
will return your call on the federal line.

Dear Dori,
 
If your workshop program (
or whatever you will finally call it) uses
 
really traditional local artists as instructors, T should think the panel
 
would find it an interesting idea.  I
'll enclose another set of guidelines;
 
please give us a suggested list of the kinds of skills you would have
 
taupbt and who some of the teachers might be.
 
The real proble" is that I am afraid it will be too late for us to be able
 
to get you even a small a"ount of money this summer.  You would have to
 
get An application in for our April first deadline, and even that could not
 
support a program that was going
, to take place earlier than, say, the middle
 
of August.
 
Why not rake your plans for next surmer?  That would give you more time
 
to pull a really exciting program together.

Dear Ms. Har
iada,
 
Thank you for your interesting proposal.
 
The Polk Arts Program has occasionally been able to assist witty some of
 
the costs involved in mounting proprams such as you describe.  Powever, I
 
would urge that you read our enclosed guidelines very carefully.  Since we are
 
a small program with very limited funds, we restrict our support very
 
carefully to truly traditional arts and artists.
 
I a
s
sn also a bit concerned about the broad sweep of cultures you plan t
o
 
include in your project.  Do you really think that you have the staff and the
 
research capability to present such a broad topic as "Asian-American
.
 
artists"?  I don't know the situation in Portland, but in Arlington,
 
Q2rginia where I live, that would include the crafts and traditional arts
 
of Chinese, .
Japanese, Korean, Viet Namese, Laotian, Cambodian, Philipi
.no
 
and possibly others that don't occur to me at the moment -- a truly
 
formidable responsibility.  The sane thing, I would think, would hold true
 
for dative Americans.  There are quite a number of distinct tribes represented
 
in the state of Oregon: it would seem to we a difficult task to present
 
accurately and sensitively the arts of so many different groups.
 
Let me s
nake a suggestion.  The Oregon Arts Council has recently employed
 
a folklorist named Steven Siporin as the nev state folly arts coordinator.
 
You can reach him by telephone at (
503)378--3625.  I would recommend that
 
the two of you get together and discuss your project in more detail.  A
 
person-to-person talk is always mare productive an+i legs tedious then letter
 
writing.  You can, of course, always reach a
me by phone by calling person-
to--person collect at 202-634--4212, and I will return your call on the
 
federal line.  Still, I do think a d1scussion with Steve would be the first step.

 PROCEDURAL ALTERNATIVES
  
The number of international touring opportunities for
 
artists and organizations is very limited, and the ICA
 
makes the final selection of organizations, repertory and
 
.
schedules.
 For these reasons, we recommend that the system
 
of identification of interest and the selection process
  
'
 remain as simple as possible.
 
.
.
`
., The Endowment may wish to place responsibility .
 for the
 
final recommendations with one or a combination of the
 
following:
 
A.
 REGULAR ENDOWMENT PANELS:
 
1
.
 Panels meeting.between March 11 - April 11: During
 
this one month period, specific ICA requests for
 
organizations and geographic areas would be presented
 
to each panel.
 About two hours should be set aside to
 
discuss overall program, specific needs and past
 
experiences.
 Possibly, 1 ICA representative could
 
be present.
 
2
.
 Panels meeting before or after March 11-April 11:
 
At any other time, panels would be asked for a small list
 
` of "the best" or the "most representative" organizations
 
or artists.(approximately 1 hour of agenda time).
 
'Geographic considerations would have to be delegated

at any t
ime during the year.
 1 ICA
 
representative could be present.
 
B.
 INTERNATIONAL PANEL:
 
Preliminary lists of recommendations made throughout
 
the year by each of the discipline panels could be
 
brought to an International Panel for final tailoring
 
.
.to the ICA's geographic needs.  A variety of ICA
 
representatives could assist the panel in evaluating
 
past experiences,  current programs and placing -cultural
 
programs in context with other ICA activities.  The
 
panel would probably meet for one full day once a
 
year according to NEA and ICA needs.
 If an International
 
Panel were used, time spent for international
 
discussions by discipline panels could be reduced
 
throughout the year.
 
f N
 
.  "AD HOC" PANELS:
 
:Small "ad hoc" panels could be established by each of
 
-
the programs to meet for 1 day sometime from March 11 to
 
April 11.' One ICA representative would be asked to
 
.
 -
r
 
attend each panel.
 Recommendations would be tailored
 
to geographic needs,' but a coherent cultural plan
 
for each goodr
.aphic arr
.n would prohnhly not he ponni
.ble
 
because of separate meetings.
 
We look forward to exploring with you the best and most
 
realistic means to fulfill the NF
.A/ICA Agreement.

Dear Dean Brackett:
 
I s
prite in support of Professor Lieberman's Candidacy as
 
Chairman of the Music Department at the university of Texas.
 
I have known Professor Lieberman for perhaps ten years.  we
 
first crossed paths at a national meeting of the Society for
 
Ethavausicology where he gave a preliminary screening of the
 
outstanding film footage he had shot in Sikhim.  I was enor-
mously impressed by the ,
poetic elegance of his film work
 
within the constraints I knew had faced him doing field work
 
in that complicated '
Land.
 Sa had accomplished a small miracle.
 
we kept in touch subsequent to our first meeting because of
 
our shared interest in film and in w ild musics, and I was
 
delighted when he took the position he now holds in the
 
Department of Music and Ethnomusicology at t
he university of
 
Washington.  During his tenure he has developed a r
emarkable
 
teaching and research facility, which I had the pleasure of
 
visiting a few years ago.  Under his leadership, the department
 
had clearly thrived.
 
When in 1977 S left my teaching position w professor of
 
anthropology at California State University at Northridge to
 
accept the position of director of the Folk Arts Progress at
 
the rational Endow ment for the Arts, one of my earliest official
 
acts was to invite Fred Liebeezman to join the: Program's advisory
 
panel.  This panel meets four times a year in Washington, D.C.
 
for two or three day sessions.  It is charged with two responsi-
bilities:  the formulation of basic polbciess concerning grants
 
and other program activities, and the recommendation for approval
 
or rejection of all applications submitted to the program.  We
 
4
,
 
-2-
review four to five hundred application a year and the
 
responsibility is a heavy one.
 
Professor Lieberman has more than lived up to the confidence
 
I had i8 him,.  I knew he was a competent and gifted musician
 
and musical theoreticians what I had not known was his
 
incisive ability to deal with budgets, administrative
 
structures and similar matters.  He is, without reservation,
 
one of our most reliable, accurate, and well-informed panelist,
 
and the entire panel relies heavily on his judgment.
 
I have further had occasion to ask professor Lieberman to
 
make site visits to a variety of folk arts organizations to
 
review their work and give these general. counsel.  Be has
 
handled these missions with tact and efficiencys he has a
 
particular ability to size up a situation quikkly and give
 
sensible advice in bath administrative and artistic problem
 
areas.
 
Overall, as you can gather, I am extremely enthusiastic
 
about Professor Lieberman as an able musician, a stimulating
 
teacher, and a practical man of vision, qualities that are
 
rarely found in tandems.  I recommend his candidacy unreservedly.

I
'm sorry to have taken so long answering
, your letter.  This i
s a
 
horrendously busy place.
 
The mechanism we were speaking of Is called an IPA appointment (
I
 
forget what the initials stand for).  The idea is that it allows federal
 
agencies to "hire" academics or state government employees for a year
 
or two without the individuals affected losing their home-based jobs.
 
The person selected goes on leave from their home institution, and the
 
borrowing agency nays the institution the requisite salary and benefits
 
he or she would normally have had.
 
IPA appointments must be requested by a particular federal agency.
 
I should think the thing for you to do would be to address a hatter to
 
Patricia McFate, Deputy Director, National Endowment for the Fumanities,
 
806 fifteenth St., N
.W., Washington, DC  20506, and tell her you're
 
interested in working for the agency.  Enclose an up--to--date vita, and
 
see what happens.  Dr. McFate has a variety of PhD's from a variety of
 
institutions; she came to Uumanities from the '
University of Pennsylvania
 
where she taught in several departments, including Folklore,  She's
 
a bright person and would be interested to hear from you, I should think.
 
One other suggestion I have would be to call Sally Yerkovich at Humanities
 
and discuss this notion with her.  S
tye► used to work for s
ae but transferred
 
over to Humanities last fall and now has a pretty good sense of the
 
inside workings of t
he place.  She might well suggest an alternate
 
strategy.  You can reach her by phonfng 202--724-0358.
 
It was great to see you in Los Angeles.  Hope evervthing is going well
 
for you, and keep in touch.

Bear Svatcha,
 
Just a quick note in answer to your lovely long letter.
 
Several people on my staff have been speaking with Ed nugetz, Tom Sim s
 
and :
Bruce Lane.  They intend to send us an application for a Texas-Czech
 
film or television series this spring
_.  It should be in a more final fort
 
than the one we saw a year ago.  The application will be reviewed at a
 
panel meeting in June and then probably again by another group in August.
 
So it seems unlikely to me that you need postpone your possible trip to
 
Prague this coming summer.  I very much doubt that. i
f the project can
 
be funded, the work could begin before the fall.
 
Still, I am glad you are still interested, and I do hope that Something
 
can be worked out.  And if you do go to Praryue and you do come through
 
Washington, it would be marvellous to see you either coming or going.
 
I am still in the same funny building but in a different apart m
ent,
 
where there is a spare room that is waiting for you.
 
Affectionately always,

Dear Mr. Pagerstrand,
 
I have been checkInF into the cyllinder recording situation at the Library
 
of Coneress for you and discover that the two tapes you mentioned in vour
 
letter of January 29 (
preservation LWO 7
008, Reels 1 and 2
) cost $18.50
 
each.  You can obtain then by writing the American
. Folklife Center at the
 
Library of Contress, Washington, D.C.  Your letter might be sent c/o
 
Ronald Walcott.
 
You right also dish to enquire from Mr. Walcott whether or not other
 
Cherokee Musical r
rateriala are turning
; up in the course of the cyllinder
 
project.  A very extensive project to copy these historic materials is
 
currently underway and it may be prerature to order copies (
other than the
 
tapes previously mentionei) until the entire operation has been completed.
 
I an not sure whether the extent of any tribe's music on federally-held
 
cyllinders could be accurately estimated at this point.
 
Finally, I as enclosing a copy of the Polk Arts Program descriptive brochure
 
for your use.  You will note that we do not specify that we provide fundi
.nb
 
for archival projects -,
 however, we are conferring with the Humanities
 
Fndo ment on the problem and hope to have arrived at a solution by the time
 
the cyllinder copying project is complete.  Please don't hesitate to
 
e
nquire again when we are just a bit further down the road.  I promise to
 
answer a bit mre promptly next tirmt

Dear Mr. Murphy*
 
Thank you for your interesting letter.  I av enclosing a copy of the
 
Folk Arts Program guidelines for your use.  You will note that our next
 
deadline is April 1
, for projects scheduled to start about six months
 
later.  I should think this would be the beat one for vou.
 
When you write up your application, you might want to address two issues
 
that occur to s
ae:  the expense, (
it seers like quite a lot of money and
 
you might want to detail the need), and whether or not Folk Arts might
 
be approached annually for new costume suprnort.
.  We are a small program
 
with a large constituency and we squeeze every nickel.  Fox this reason,
 
the panel is especially reluctant to embark on ideas that might involve us
 
in regular annual funding.  There are so many good folk arts projects
 
out there that we try to keep our funds unpledged as well as a
re can.
 
We specialize in small seed money *
rants and one or two-time support for
 
local projects while other funding sources can be sought.
 
We will keep your original letter to put with your application when it
 
arrives.  Don't hesitate to send in additional backup information or cost
 
breakdowns.  We have a concerned and hard-working panel and they will
 
read attentively anything you send.  Should you have any further questions
 
about our procedures, don't hesitate to call me person-to-person collect
 
at 202--634-4282 and I will return your call on the federal line at no
 
cost to you.  You might also wish to consult your own state folk arts
 
coordinator, Dick Spitzer, who can be reached at Division of the Arts,
 
Box 44247, Baton Rouge, LA  70804, (
504)342-6467.  He interned at the
 
Endowment and is an old friend of the Folk Arts Program.  I
'm sure he would
 
be happy to help.
 
By the way, you might be interested to know that my brother, Alan Lomax,
 
wrote one of the early books on Jelly Roll Morton, and both he and I
 
know New Orleans well.  It was delightful to hear from your fine organi-
zation, and I hope to be able to visit the festival one of these years
 
soon.  '
please send next year's dates, when you know them!

Dear Charlie:
 
Just a hasty note to say that I
'm afraid I cannot wake it to the CFS
 
meeting in April after all.  The change to April 19 really wiped me out;
 
as I had said to you, I think, I have another conference that sarie
 
v "kend.  I had hoped, rather impractically, to try to make one end of
 
one and the other end of the other.  April 19 is right in the middle,
 
though, so I guess I
'd better bow out.
 
I hope it all goes well.  Please masse s
py apologies to everyone concerned,
 
and tell them I hope to nake C

Eere was a down-]somas Mississippi black man singing old-time blues and talking
 
about hard times to an every day class full of children in a uis©lasipri
 
public school and the whole thing was being broadcast over national television
 
just as though it weren't anything special at all, as though it was just as
 
ordinary an occurreate as t

I still don't quite believe it.  This is my sixtieth birthdaay ?

watched and worked and worried for i
s pretty long tine; vaybe it was all for
 
that one minute.  I wonder if even you. as an experienced young southerner, have

I am talking art, you underasta*gd, not politics -- excent irsofar as politics 19

To Whom It May Concern
 
I have knawn Martha.Ruenhold since January of 1
.977 when I ;
Joined the staff
 
of the Special Projects Program at the `N
ational pna mnaent for the Artn in
 
Washington, D
.C.  At that time, Me. Kuenhold was acting as program secretary.
 
She continued in that position until January of 1978; when the Folk Arta Program
 
was set up as a separate:
 office ,
 Ms
. Fuenhole joined us as Program Specialist,
 
primarily acting as grants officer.  Inter, as Folk Arts' staff grew to six,
 
she was pronnoted to Program Administrator . Since that time, she has confined
 
her grants responsibility to general supervision and trouble shooting and has
 
added to her list of duties both the
. ProorA
 is ndr4inistrative ene programmatic
 
budget calculations as •
*
sell as the general ti
anagement of the office and the
 
supervision of the rapport staff . f
our pro-rasa funds have amounted to as much
 
as $3,01n,OCC and our a4ministrative r
.
.
s
c
snevss to $
200,000.
 
t
4s. Fuenhold is a person of exceptional character and ability.  She is
 
attractive and poised and handles face-to-face or telephonic contacts easily.
 
She is imaginative and ingenious  she is also that all-too-rare type -- a
 
self-starter who not only liken to solve problems but takes the initiative to
 
discover where V-e problems are that need solutions.  She is orderly and
 
dependable , rarely absent and never later, she has a strong ethical sense:.  She
 
is a fast worker and enjoys completing tasks , she covets a clean desk.  She
 
has a particular flair for f
is►
.ures . most of all
., she is fun to have around.
 
A cheerful office i
s a fine thing, and
. Martha Kuenhold has helped keep ours
 
that way.
 
I
 would recommend Ys. Kuenhold without hesitation for any position involving
 
people, or figures ,
 or both . I would also be happy to an. wer any detailed
 
questions a prospective employer might have about her either in person or in
 
w
sritin�;
.  Needless to say, p
is. kuenhold's resignation is voluntary and for personal
 
reasons having to do with her own career develorzent.

Dear Ilyan:
 
Herewith the latest in our communications with the Turkish-American
 
Cultural Alliance.  The reason for the exchange i
s that Dr. Akdemir has
 
insisted that their accountant will not allow him to pay any of the
 
people involved in the execution of last year's grant without a letter
 
of authorization from our office.  He has assured ve repeatedly that he
 
wants you to continue as advisor to the project next year.  F
?owever, he
 
maintains that using you as project director is impractical, since the
 
position calls for constant minor decision-making and reaching you by
 
phone is both expensive and unnecessarily t
ime-consuming.
 
The administrative complexities leading up to this are really too complicated
 
to go into in a letter.  Perhaps we should talk them over by phone if you
 
are disturbed by t
his development.  However, from here I could see no
 
other method of straightening out the past year's grant in t
ime for them
 
to apply for refunding this coming s uer.  Again I have emphasized to
 
them that we require evidence that some cultural and aesthetic expertise
 
must be involved in a new grant request, and that the position of cultural
 
advisor would perhaps better suit your real relationship with their
 
multitudinous activities.
 
Alan asks mr to send you his best wishes along with f
iine.  He has been staying
 
with me the past several months working at the Library of Congress, and
 
we've had a really pleasant family reunion t
hereby.

Dear Dr. Akdemir,
 
As requested in your letter of January 25, the Polk Arts Program has
 
approved the appointment of Mr. Aytug Izat as the project director of
 
your current grant.  We understand that you will continue to call on
 
Professor Ilyan Basgoz's expertise as necessary in order to maintain the
 
very highest artistic standards in your presentation of Turkish and
 
Turkish-American traditional arts.  We also approve the two recently
 
appointed employees of the Turkish American Cultural Alliance as described
 
in a recent telephone conversation with Ys. ?
Martha iuenhold of the Folk
 
Arts staff.
 
A separate letter from the Grants Officer at the Arts Endowment approving
 
the time extension of your project dates through '
larch 1
, 1980 will follow.
 
We look forward to receiving an application for second year support, and
 
hope the confusion over this year's grant has not delayed you in preparing►
 
the form.

Dear Don:
 
I am afraid you will have to file another application form if
 
you will again need federal funding for the 1980 Pipestem
 
festival.  There is no way we can carry over an application from
 
one year to another.  We will need a report from last year's
 
festival and an application in a hurry; it's already very
 
late.
 
I must point out, Don, that if you had read the information
 
sent you in the last grant package and returned the cash
 
request form we enclosed, you would have had your check by
 
return g
rail.  I
le are dealing with hundreds of applications
 
each month; there is no possible way we can follow each one
 
through and make sure that each grantee has requested their
 
:
coney.  Many people don't runt their :
coney a12 in one lump
 
or prefer us to hold it until a specific time.

At the last Council meeting, Roy Helms told g
ee that he had liked the
 
Folk Arts statistical breakdown that was included in the Council book
 
pages and thought it gave an interesting and clear picture of our
 
operation.  He asked permission to reprint it as a special insert in
 
the NASA newsletter, with possibly a brief description of the state
 
folk arts coordinator program added.
 
Since the Cultural Post is printing a story about r
olk Arts in its 
next issue, I wondered whether or not this might be overkill.  I also
 
wondered who -- if anybody -- I should consult about this -- you, or
 
Bank Putsch, or just make up my own mind?

Dear Glenn,
 
Thank you for your recent letter and for the photographs taken as part of
 
the crafts survey.  Regarding use of the photos, please don't be alarmed.
 
Publication is only one of several possibilities for using the information
 
gathered in this survey.  We have not yet received a final report from
 
Bruce Nickerson and therefore have no real notion whether or not it
 
would be worth publishing.  Certainly there would be some consultation
 
with the participants in the project before we rushed into print.
 
However, I noted with interest the photographs you sent with another
 
thought in mind.  We are tryinp to build up a file of black and white
 
photos suitable for reproduction that have emerged from projects funded
 
by Folk Arts.  We need them from time to time for news stories in the
 
CULTURAL POST, for our guideline brochure and for similar Endowment
 
publications.  We give credit and a small fee when used.  Would you be
 
interested in making perhaps ten or so of your prints available for us?
 
Bob Teske is in charge of this project and could answer any particular
 
questions t
ilat might occur to you.
 
Bob and I would be very interested in discussing the crafts survey with
 
you when you come to Washington next.  It was not ideal from our point
 
of view either, but we can taik that over better in person.
 
Thank you again for your help and for the photographs.

Dear George.
 
It was nice to speak w ith you the other day.  I still remember my visit
 
to Cody wits enormous pleasure.  I
've f
inally located the recording I
 
wanted to s
end you, and I
'll get it in the mall to you soon.
 
I think we may have f
ind a misunderstanding* over the phone.
 (
I hate phones
 
anyway.)  I have a new position added to my staff, and I
'm looking for
 
ghat the Covernment calls an Arts Specialist.  I already have two -- one
 
is a ethnowusicologlat who is bi-lingual in Spanish and has d
ome field
 
work in Mexico and the southwest; he basically works with all our grantees
 
and applicants but especially those from the far-east, and those with
 
musical projects of all kinds as well as anything Rio-panic (
wexican-
American, Puerto Rican, Afro-Cuhan, etc.)  The other one is a folklorist
 
who has taught for four years at Western Y
.entucky; he is a crafts and
 
ruseum specialist and works with projects involving material culture,
 
particularly those from ruropean-Americans and Appalachians.  Re comes
 
from Wisconsin, so he especially enjoys working with pe+pple from the Vreat
 
Lakes area where he hopes to return someday.  But, like the first one, he
 
has to be able to handle anything or anybody who comes in the office.
 
I am now looking for a third person on about that level -- not a first
 
job - a middle career person with sufficiently broad training to be able
 
to discuss cultural problems with Lithuanians and Sioux and Eskimos,
 
blues pickers and African druemaers and split-oak '
basket makers.
 
That's why I loop for people with anthropological, folkloric, American
 
studies, or ethnomusicological training.  The PhD is not essential for
 
rt
e, but the Government says you get a blwher salary if you have one.
 
My third Arts Specialist, I hope, will have especial background, training,
 
and interest in Native American culture; I
'd also like to hire soneone
 
who is interested in media -- film, recording, and t
.v.  '
We have many
 
proposals in these areas and no one on staff who is especially qualified
 
to deal with them.  If I can locate an American Indian with either or
 
both of these areas of interest, I will be delighted, but I agree with you
 
that the search will be hard.
 
However, I have people other than Arts Specialists on my staff for which the
 
qualifications are not so specialized -- administrators, grants officers, etc.
 
I don't happen to have such a vacancy at the moment, but I know T will
 
have one day, and besides, I hear of other positions that open up at the
 
Endowment all the time.  If you know of talented Indians with art or
 
museum interests or the like who would like to work in Vashington for a
 
while, I a
cs certain I could help them find a job.  Why not suggest that
 
they send m
e: their resumes (
and preferably a federal form 171 at the same
 
time)?  We don't at the moment have a single American Indian on staff
 
as far as I know-in the whole Endowment, and I think it is a disgrace.
 
I also don't think t
hat an American Indian has ever applied here, and i
tis
 
a nice place to work.
 
I
'll enclose a job announcement for the Arts Specialist position if it's
 
ready by the time this letter is tyred.  I
'd appreciate it if you'd post
 
it, and ask anybody you know to apply.  We keep all names on f
ile, and i
f
 
a particular vacancy doesn't happen to fit, we will reco merd them to the
 
next one that n
oes.
 
Would you consider a '
Washington job yourself one of these days?  I
t's not
 
a bad place to live -- kind of interesting.  Think about it. and let me n
 
know.

Dear George,
 
At long! last I have succeeded in locating copies of the albums I had
 
wanted to send you for your own personal enjoyment and whatever pleasure
 
they might bring visitors to the Plains Indian Museum.
 
The songs were recorded by Professor Willard Rhodes during the thirties
 
and forties, I believe, so that they are not exactly up to date-
, however,
 
the music is of historical interest and might stir memories among some of
 
the senior traditionalists.  I have had the album notes xeroxed for you,
 
since the Library of Congress has gotten around to having them properly
 
printed.  Please, therefore, do not reproduce them; they are for your infor-
mation only.  There is a long complicated story about these notes that I
 
will tell you one day when we meet a
ttain.
 
All the above reminds v
ie to suggest to you that you might want some year
 
to invite Professor Rhodes to give a presentation at  your conference on
 
Plains Indian culture.  He is a dear gentleman, well into his seventies,
 
I believe, and would be deeply moved, 1 am sure, to see what a splendid
 
collection you have put together.
 
With all best wishes to you and your family.

Dear Joe,
 
I thought it might be useful to set down the gist of our discussion of
 
the ethnic tours problem last week.  The following notes cover the
 
discussion as I understood it; if I got anything wrong, please don't
 
hesitate to correct me.
 
January 11, 1480:  Discussion of ethnic tours.  Present:  Joe Wilson, Dick Shea
 
Kathy Pfieffer, Bill Kornrich of HCTA; Bess Hawes, Dan Sheehy, NrA
 
Characteristics of the ethnic tour program:
 
1
 1
)  Tours are made up of ad hoc assemblages of artists, the finest
 
that can be found from all parts of the country.  Each touring group,
 
therefore, must be funded for a rehearsal period as well as the tour
 
itself.
 
^
)  Tours are planned primarily to reach audiences of the same
 
ethnicity though the general public is also welcome.  Sites will be
 
chosen accordingly, though one or two general public concerts can be
 
included for financial reasons.
 
3
)  Tours will be planned and staffed by the best possible cultural
 
experts available as artistic directors and persenters.  Ynowledgable
 
scholars will be involved as well as practicing cultural activists.
 
4
)  Tours will feature musical and dance styles traditional within
 
the particular ethnicity.  Modern or emergent forms nay or any not be
 
included; traditional forms always will be.
 
5
)  There will be an educational component included in each presen-
tation, by whatever means are appropriate -- informational programs,
 
presenter's remarks, public announcements, posters, translation techniques etc.
 
6
)  Each tour will be planned to create a waive, to maintain some kind
 
of continuing relationship with the conm►unity visited after the tour coves
 
on, to maximize the impact of the tour visit while the folks are there.
 
Appearances on local radio and television programs, guest concerts in
 
schools, master classes and/or informal sessions with local musicians
 
and dancers will be scheduled in every possible location.
 
2
 
Ethnic tours discussed:
 
1
)  Appalachian tour (
currently funded and being planned by Joe Wilson
 
and dill Kornrich)
 
2
)  French tour (
possible venture being considered by Missouri
 
Friends of the Folk Arts to visit Missouri and Louisiana under leadership
 
of Kathy Pfieffer.  Some discussion of second leg of tour hitting; New
 
England; possibility of includion of I
titchiff Indians also mentioned.)
 
3
)  Jewish tour to feature Klezmer music (
possible venture being
 
investigated by Bill Kornrich.  Mark Slobin, Ruth Rubin, Mr. ?
.opoznick
.
 
and Balkan Arts personnel recommended as consultants.)
 
4
)  Mexican-American tours. (Two possibilities -- a tour through
 
central California valley and another from Texas north through the
 
midwest being discussed by Dan Sheehy and Dick Shea.  Tour organizer
 
needed
 Y )
 
5
)  Puerto Rican tour.  (
Dan mentioned possibility of organizing
 
Puerto Rican/Newyorkican tour to be organized by Hector Vega, Puerto
 
Rican ethnomusicologist.)
 
organizational problems:
 
1
)  NCTA, in order to mount a tour activity greater than the current
 
Irish and Appalachian effort
 „would need staff additional to Dick Shea.
 
Bess and Dan will see about the possibility of Expansion Arts institutional
 
support grant.
 
2
)  Dick
. Shea, if he returns to school, may be able to work part-time
 
on touring; whether or no, he needs to start training some full or part
 
time help.
 
3
)  Folk Arts will need to estimate total costs carefully especially
 
in view of the energy situation and rising transportation expenses.
 
Continuing on a one-¢rant-per-tour basis for the next year may prove the
 
wisest course.
 
4
)  It was agreed that, although NCTA is currently interested and
 
active in developing an ethnic touring program, neither NCTA or Folk Arts
 
is bound to this.  Folk Arts will continue to consider suitable applications
 
from other organisations, i
f any are received; NCTA will continue to keep
 
all its irons hot and will seek advice from its board before getting much
 
further into the business.  All options were to stay open for the time
 
being.
 
That's all I can remember, Joe.  As I said, don't hesitate to edit and
 
return, if you want.  I mostly got this down for my own use in explaining
 
the program to the administration here and to others w
tio may enquire.

UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT
 
memorandum
 
1)
 Concerning recent grants in the state of Arizona, Folk Arts,
 
as ycu  observed,  funded Phoenix Coming Together,  Inc. to
 
the amount of $1,000 while Expansion Arts gave them up to
 
$3,000, both in support of the annual "Hello Phoenix"
 
festival.
 
Mr. Biddle should know that in spite of appearances,
 
there is no overlap here,
 Expansion Arts is funding
 
the festival in general.
 Our grant is specifically
 
"for support for field work to identify local folk
 
artists and to include them in the  I
festival.
 
The Festival has featured general community and ethnic
 
arts for the past three years;  this is their first
 
serious attempt to focus upon folk traditions in their
 
activities."
 Folk Arts funds will go to a professional
 
field worker and to fees for the folk artists that he
 
or she locates in the Phoenix area.
 We're rather pleased
 
with this grant;  it is economical and represents a bit of
 
a break-through for us in the Phoenix area.
 
2)
 Folk Arts grants to Indian tribes in Arizona are attached.
 
There are two additional things the Chairman might want
 
to know:
 
a.
 We are taking to March panel meeting an application
 
from the Museum of Northern Arizona for a project
 
to document Navajo rug-making techniques.
 This is
 
pending; no recommendation has yet been made.
 
b.
 Along with Special Projects, we are in negotiation
 
with the Hopi 
about appropriate arts-related activ-
ties in celebration of their 1980 tri-centennial.
 
This anniversary commemorates the uprising of the
 
southwestern tribes in 1680 against the Spanish,
 
who were defeated and temporarily driven back into
 
what is now Mexico.
 Folk Arts has sent panelist
 
Clydia Nahwooksy to provide technical assistance to
 
the several Hopi Mesas in planning their observance.
 
Special Projects has given them a planning grant to
 
the same end.
 We anticipate that they will this
 
year approach several Endowment Programs  (probably
 
Museums and Folk Arts) with applications relating to
 
their cultural activities this year.

he Folk Arts Program at the national Fndowaent for the Arts.
 
I have read your proposal and back-up information concerning the production
 
with much interest . Clearly, this is a p

hat should be seen by many
 
Americans . Unfortunately, your project appears to fall outside the Folk
 
Arts Program guidelines,
 a copy of which I e
nclose for your interest.

comaaunity, thus ve touch t
heater seldor.
 and confine our media support to
 
projects that document or present traditional artist
ic practices current

troup.
 
I
t seems to me, however , that your project might be fundable under t

forwarding i
t to them with a recoam

Dear Roger:
 
I agree wholeheartedly with the principle of panel rotation un-

I hope -- one of my  good friends.  And then I grumble and swear
 
and think -- how on earth can I get along without you?
 
My major consolation is that you will continue to advise and
 
counsel the Folk Arts Program in the capacity of consultant.
 
I will try not to make a nuisance of myself, but I will be
 
calling on you from time to time; there is nobody I know who
 
can quite take your place.
 I Dope you realize what a splendid
 
contribution you made to the development of the program= I
 
really think it will stand over time as a model of what a
 
group of sincere and intelligent and concerned citizens can
 
create together.
 
Thank you once again for all your help and all your good advice.

I understand from Carl Petric that Elizabeth Bybee, has passed away.
 
I am enclosing the recording as a donation in Me. Bybee`s r

however, that the Flathead and the ?
fez Perce share a .
s
►
,
reat number of
 
songs and melodies, so perhars this record will be of some interest
 
to you and your students.
 
Please accept my condolences on your great loss, and s

for the success of your school.

I hope that you are well and that the winter is not too severe in Idaho.
 
Mrs. Farl tells me that you are t

wonderful that you are passing along your knowledge and skill to the

Dear Professor Alegria,
 
This is a sadly belated note to thank you for sending the Folk Arts
 
Program the beautiful Puerto Rican folk arts posters.  I had thought to
 
write you a rote of thanks right away -
-- and so vividly that x actually
 
began to believe that I had! -
-- until your note cas
te asking if we had
 
received the posters.  I apologize for the delay, and send you wa rt
 
thanks for your generosity.  We are most appreciative.  We have sent
 
them but to be framed; as soon as they return, we will grace our offices
 
with th us.
 
I also owe you, I suspect, thanks for referring Sr. Tirado and Sr. Cbiesa
 
to me . I have had several long, delightful and; I hope, productive
 
meetings with both of these gentlemen.  They sees to me to be doing
 
exceptionally fine work, and I have great hopes that we will be able to
 
develop some successful strategies for assisting ther with some of the
 
costs involved in their exciting projects.  I should like that more than
 
anything.
 
Has Dan Sheehy written you yet that he plans to com
m
ie to Puerto Rico some
 
time in the next month?  He will get in touch, I an  sure, when his plans
 
are more exact, and will hope you have time to meet with him.  We are
 
honored that you have consented to be a consultant to our program: I am
 
sure that Dan will have many questions to discuss with you.
 
We will continue to hope that the panel can one day meet in Puerto Rico.
 
I can of imeRIne a happier site.

Dear mr. Cartwright,
 
Fell, I
've checked around for the Wabanaki Alliance newsletter and come
 
up with nothing, as you anh I feared.  The Literature Program at the
 
Fndowment at least provided me with guidelines, which I enclose for
 
your interest, but I saw nothing there that could help you, and neither
 
did their staff.
 
It really is a shame.  If it's any consolation, I personally thought
 
the i
ssues you sent were extremely interesting and the entire publication
 
obviously extremely worthwhile.  I
'll enclose a copy of our guidelines -
maybe you'd like to put a little article about us in a future issue
 
in case we can help somebody else.  Do you suppose newspapers have to
 
be self--supporting so that they won't become corruptl  Fell that to
 
Scrinps-Howard, maybe.
 
Anyway, thank you for sending me the issues, and gooe luck.  Tell candy
 
Ives hello for me the next time you see bin.
 
With best regards,

Dear Dr. rivon,
 
I an embarrassed to d
iscover that I have not answered your letter of
 
November 30.  I suppose your pl;ms to delay applyine rade we relax my
 
normal vigilance.
 
Concerning your questions:
 
1
)  MatehinA funds.  ?
Normally, the Endowment likes a 5
0-5n match.
 
However, Folk Arts typically deals with groups that are high on energy and
 
low on cash: therefore, we accept so-called "soft" match, and in special
.
 
cases, even allow partial match.  When you get aeady to wort out your budget,
 
I would recommend that you consult our grants officer, Martha Kuenhold,
 
about how to figure your match in detail.  Such i
te m as overhead costs
 
can be donated back to the program, as can labor costs and the expenses
 
that would be involved if you had to rent such items as tape recorders,
 
typewriters anti the like.  There are many gays to skin that cat and Ms.
 
ruenhold knows most of
, them.  Some cash is always advisable, however.
 
2
)  Distribution.  Your distribution plans sound very, complete.
 
About hew sany copies of your story collection would be involved?
 
3
)  Deadlines.  "hough it's all right to do it, I don't believe I
 
would submit your request a year ahead of your start date, simply because of
 
ever-increasing inflation.  I should think it would be difficult to plan
 
a realistic budget too far ahead of time, and budget a
ttending is a t
ime--
consuming process.  I think Tour safest het would be to submit to the
 
deadline that falls about eight or nine months before you plan to start.
 
I have one additional reaction.  This is the Arts Yndocment, and I would
 
recommend that when you get around to writing up the final application you
 
stress t
he artistic quality and value of the stories you plan to collect
 
and distribute.  I
'd feel safer specifying Just how you right do that i
f
 
I had a clearer i
dea of l
ust w
!-at you plan to do.  Apparently you Plan to
 
produce booklets---books? ­ containing traditional Ute narratives.  Row will
 
they be selected?  Will they be Published in the or in Fmplisb or in both?
 
Will they be i
llustrated and do you plan to go into print or keep to a
 
s
impler format and work with off
.-set t
vpe and the like?  If your product has
 
"literary met h", we might be able to refer you to our Literature Program
 
(
which has s
nore money than Folk
. Artsl) or at least get you some cooperation
 
from their Small Press Program.  Some time when you are not off in Colorado,
 
- 2 -
 
g1ve we a call person to person collect at 202
_-634-4282 and I
'll return your
 
call on the federal line so that we can talk the whole project over.  I
 
really need more detail in order to be able to help better.  Or just drop
 
me another letter at your convenience.
 
I hope your work continues to vo well.

Dear Professor Satterthwaite,
 
Thant
/ you for your letter and outline of your project.  T apologize for
 
not responding sooner- we have had a flurry of enquiries recently, and I
 
an way '
behind in answering my mail.
 
I enclose a copy of the Folk Arts guidelines for your information and
 
possible use, though, to be honest with you, I rather doubt that the
 
Folk Arts panel will recorwend f
lour project for our funding.  The essential
 
problem is that your focus i
s on training students to use media rather
 
than on folk or ethnic arts or artists.  The budget, for example, includes
 
$20,000 for media equipment (which we do not provide); the rest i
s for
 
training.  There is no indication that the artists being documented would
 
get any relm
-bursement for their time or services nor is there any sign
 
that cultural
. experts would be consulted as to which artistic practices
 
need to be documented and what filmic approach should he used.  Both these
 
are required in terms of our guidelines.
 
In general, it seems to me that you have an essentially educational rrolect
 
here and that you should seek funding from some department in the Office
 
of education.  The Arts Endowment really does very little with educational
 
pro rams, other than our Artists in Schools activity.  Please understand
 
that I don't think you have a bad idea! its just that you've gone to the
 
wrong
, federal office.  The Arts Endowment
. basically exists to support
 
developed and mature artists, we normally leave training up to other
 
agencfes.
 
I am sorry to sound so discouraging.  You should remember that this is
 
only staff opinion and that you have a perfect right to apply to the
 
Folk Arts Program in spite of m9  a
tloomy prosmosis.  Read through t
he
 
guidelines and see what you think.  i do have a couple of additional
 
suggestions.  You should think about the possiblity of applying to your
 
awn Arizona Cormission on the Arts and Humanities*
, you can f
ind them at
 
6330 north Seventh Street, Phoenix, Arizona  85014; (
601)271-5€PA .
 
A further thought is that you might want to consult Kith Jim Bfiffiths,
 
who is acting as the Arizona folk arts coordinator.  Fe is located at the
 
University of Arizona In Tucson, and can be reached by phone at (
602
.)
 
626-3392.  Jim is a good man and might have some further ideas for you.

Dear f
ir. Stokes.
 
I have been a
waked to write concerning the application of Richard Shea to the
 
Law School at the University of Virginia.
 
I have known n
ick for the past several years, first as an employee of the
 
National Center for Urban Ethnic Affairs where he did some preliminary studies
 
and planning that resulted in an application from the organization to the
 
National Endowment for the Arta.
 
After the grant was approved for funding, I had occasion to meet frequently
 
with Dick as project director for the conduct of that grant.  Pe proved to
 
be hard-working, energetic, intelligent, and responsible.  Hie ability in
 
administrative organization, budgeting, and data-gathering was exemplary
 
and, frankly, startling in one so young.
 
Since that initial grant, Dick has successfully prepared and advinistered
 
several additional grant applications.  I should think he would he an outst
W
 ing
 
candidate for law school, and I reco mend him to your attention in the
 
highest terms.
 
Should you have additional questions that I might be able to answer, please
 
don't hesitate to call me at 202-634-42A2

anitor's expenses and supplies and than like) ,
 he
 
applied again for the same thing.  I then took the application to panel
 
which, naturally, burned i
t down.
 
Then
. T sent Roper Abra3her}s in an a site visit.  non wasn't home. Then 
T ysent Archie Creen in on a site visit; he connected for only one evening
 
(
T
)on was off on a reading tour for most of the weekend Archie had planned
 
to spend).  Archie talYed him into sending us a fundable application, the
 
VA panel triumphantly funded it, but '
ton never tot around to looking at
 
the !
rant pecket we sent him.
 
The f
irst we knew that ev

.
 
asking where was his money R months alter the Grant was a

Inrgpn finally wrote Dan a

`xr1ainion the situation; Dozy finally sent in the form requesting all his
 
money and it was sent him Novwnl er 29.
 
During the past tvc years, he has been s
ending out leaflets and posters

statine triumphantly; "This project in not being funded by the National

and don't rind at all his slanArrIng us all orer the place, but T do
 
want panel members to feel that we are Pt  least raking an effort to t

Ton about all this! I am trying t
o
 
keep on speaking terms with pis?.  The real rrobler is that he Is alros3t

I know our panel would want to

Why not keep in touch as s

s
tage where Folk Arts could actually be of

Dear No. Cockre hl,
 
I
 t t first apologise for delaying so long in answering your letter
 
co ne  ing the Nolen Parkne ss Flanders collection.  December i
s always
 
a difficult sett►.
 
You are probably correct in your assumption that the Arts Endeva mt Yolk
 
Arts Prourar would not be able to fund your plaos as they are am d
evelop ":
 
h
eawever, we are always happy to bear of such plans in their owleal stage
 
since there are always possibilities for projects to grow out of such
 
efforts that we could help with.
 
I shall enclose a copy of our guidelines for your consideration in this
 
future context.  In the seantime, I think you're p
rise to consider
 
submitting an application to WM, a
lmd I an snr
+e n
ay colleagues there have
 
already been in t
ouch with you.
 
It seems to s
ee your plans are .
already in very good she ", and  L
 Mould
 
hesitate to offer any real suggestions at this point.  Thar* are, howe "r,
 
a couple of additional a ss I could mention.  I as sure you =met already
 
be in touch with Jane Beck, who is working out of the aerment Arts Council
 
as state folk arts coordinator; her e
avwber there is ("2)g2g-3291.
 
Another person who I know would be very Interested in hearing of your p

Dear -
Mr. Ha nson
 
I
'm sorry you didn't have a good tine at the Colder Cate Festival.  We
 
provide a part of the funds used at a great a
s ter of festivals across the
 
country; some dd the festivals include ausit created out of a religious
 
i
vrAse In their progra m and so m do not.
 
As you know, a great deal of artistic creation has ste=ned free religious,
 
a
s well as anti—religious convicttong.  Our art galleries across the nation,
 
as Nell as our concert halls are
a fall of works speaking to both positions.
 
I personally believe t
hat everyone should have froedom of choice.
 
The delicate part of the i
ssue is whether or not the Hallelujah chorus or
 
Farther /Moog is sang for its Wsicol interest of its textual cost
 
Amt.
 
'
hat
 •
 s not &hays easy to determine.  Certainly, support of direct pro-
 
syletisiug wou U place the Covernuent is the unacceptable pos i  t of
 
advancing religieve activity and should be avoided.  Mr
stever, let n
ee assure
 
you that Endow mat s
upport was for,prosentation of the Festival as an
 
artistic experience and cultural e
'.aant.  Z hope that during t
he two or three
 
days of the Festival, you heard s
e e t ic that you did enjoy.
 
Sincerely,
