Moore and Donald Eugene Stacy
INTERVIEW LOG
00:00:29  Name is Rhonda Estrada.  Lives in Hermiston, Oregon.  Has been a home care worker 
since 2007.  
00:00:43  Works mostly as a home care provider for Senior & Disabled Services, but recently 
became a personal support worker (PSW).  
00:01:03  How did you become a home care worker?  Worked for migrant Head Start for five 
years, and a friend asked her to work as a substitute home care provider.  The consumer let her 
friend go and hired her.  Then she began to work for Senior & Disabled Services.  
00:02:02  Previous jobs - worked in the fast food industry.  Caregiving is different because there 
is more compassion involved.  The pace is slower as well.
00:03:00  Special qualities needed?  Compassion and patience.  
00:03:17  How did you gain your job skills?  Became a mother at a young age; has four children.
00:03:37  Typical duties - grocery shopping, helping clients with laundry, taking consumers to 
medical appointments, providing medication help, housekeeping.  Currently has three 
consumers.  
00:04:10  Works 25-30 hours per week.  
00:04:20  Do you become close to your consumers?  Has known one of her consumers for 25 
years, and she does not want anyone else to work for her.  They are able to maintain a 
professional relationship during Rhonda's working hours.  Rhonda takes her job very seriously.  
00:06:00  She does get to know some of her consumers' family members.  
1
00:07:02  There a lot of caregivers in her area.  They get together through the union.  Rhonda is 
very active in SEIU.  She helps run meetings in Umatilla County, serves as an alternate on the 
bargaining team, and serves as a steward.
00:08:06 The union was around when she started working as a caregiver.  Went to her first 
meeting and immediately joined.  “SEIU [Service Employees International Union] has been 
amazing for me.”  Has traveled to Minnesota and Pennsylvania to help start unions and also 
attended a leadership conference in St. Louis.  Did not know that she was a leader until the union
picked her to go.  She did not travel at all before becoming a union activist.  
00:10:30  Discusses what she tells potential union members when going door-to-door during 
organizing drives.  
00:11:00  Talks about meeting new friends through the union.
00:11:29  Discusses talking to legislators about her work.  Had not previously participated in 
public speaking.
00:12:04  Having a sense of humor on the job is important.  She can laugh and joke with one of 
her current clients.  
00:12:46  What you do to relax?  Takes care of her family, which is very important to her.
00:13:39  Hardest part of your job?  Being a personal support worker (PSW) and working with 
people with mental disabilities.  Rhonda's daughter-in-law is a PSW supervisor and convinced 
her to become one.  The consumers tend to be more challenging than people with physical 
disabilities.  
00:15:05  She recently recruited her daughters into the home care industry.  Both of them work in
Umatilla County.    
00:15:40  Asserts that Umatilla County needs more home care workers.  Talks about a client who
faced significant health and financial challenges and only receives 20 hours per month of care.  
00:18:00  Was on the SEIU bargaining team two years ago.  The union received two raises–one 
from $10.20 per hour to $13 per hour and another from $13 per hour to $13.75 per hour.  
Currently fighting for $15 per hour plus retirement and sick leave pay.  
00:18:51  Paid sick leave is very important because home care workers should not get their 
clients sick.  They should have enough time to recover from illnesses.  Home care workers get 
exposed to germs as well.  Most of her consumers tell her, though, when they are sick.

00:19:37  Favorite part of the job - taking care of her consumers.  She thought she would only be
in the field temporarily, but does not want to leave it now.  Does want to become a CNA or a 
nurse someday.
00:20:27  Talks about being a grandmother.  Often takes care of her three-year-old 
granddaughter.
00:22:07  Discusses the similarities between working for Head Start and being a caregiver.  
00:22:50  How do you think you were received by legislators when you talked to them about 
your work?  Rhonda told them about her consumer who had to panhandle on the corner for 
money in a wheelchair, and they were moved by the story.  
00:24:31  The future of the field - Thinks that the work should continue.  “Caregiving is a field 
that will never go away.”  It's sad that consumers sometimes have a hard time getting hours.  
Thinks that there are a lot of people out there who do not know that they can go into caregiving 
and receive union benefits.  “People just need to know what's out there and we can probably get 
more caregivers that want to do the caregiving.”  
00:26:36  Thinks that the “average person” in the community does not always understand what a 
caregiver does, but once she explains the work, they get it.  Many people ask, “How come we 
don't get the kind of pay you guys get?”  
00:27:43  Describes working as a PSW for someone whom she has known for 20 years.  He 
asked her, “How come you're treating me like this?  We're friends.”  She explained that there are 
rules associated with the job.  Also describes strategies that help her interact effectively with her 
consumer.
