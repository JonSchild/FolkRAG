Briana OHiggins interviewing Mario Cervantes January  
 
Mario Cervantes, AFL CIO community services liaison, United Way of the Plains 
 
Are you from Wichita? 
 
I am. 
 
And, um, when you were growing up in Wichita, were you aware of Boeing? 
 
Absolutely, it has been kind of a family tradition; my father was working there at the 
time. 
 
Your father was working at Boeing while you grew up? 
 
Uh huh. 
 
Did any of your other, or do any of your other family members work at Boeing? 
 
My sister, actually, she was once a Boeing employee, but since the (?) she is a Spirit 
employee now.  
 
What did you think of Boeing when you were growing up, do you remember? 
 
Growing up as a child, that was just the place that my dad went to work, you know? 
Nothing special actually.  
 
Did you go to college, or university? 
 
No. 
 
How did you get hired at Boeing? 
 
Well, you know, my father worked there, of course, and he knew that there was a 
position opening up in the tooling department – plaster/pattern maker. And, boy, I 
just went everyday and put my application in, when they had a physical HR where 
you could do that. But, it was like every day I would go and check on my record or 
my resume and all that. And finally, they got tired of looking at me and interviewed 
me and set me up in tooling classes and I took eight weeks of tooling classes and I 
ended up a pattern maker.  
 
How old were you? 
 
I’m 53. 
 
How old were you then? 
 
I was 19. 
 
And how long did it take you to get that job, you say you went every day… 
 
Oh, I’d probably say six months maybe, yeah, it didn’t take very long. Classes were 
coming up pretty fast, so they needed to fill those spots. And actually I think at that 
time, I don’t want to say it was a quota, but being a minority might have helped me a 
little bit, because tooling was predominately, what I want to say, anglo, probably, so 
getting minorities in at that time in those positions was something that I think the 
government made them do, probably.  
 
You say six months was pretty quick?? That was a quick hire? 
 
It was, it seemed to be a quick hire. Of course the eight weeks was a long training 
time, we did that at the botech at East High, and I worked second shift, so I had to 
work during the day and go to class at night, and uh, it seemed like forever, but 
really it was a short span. Trying to get on at Boeing, because I was at the meat 
packing plant, and then I went to Cessna for a little bit and everybody at Cessna said, 
“ Oh you don’t want to go to Boeing,” but my dad wanted me to go out there. And it 
was kind of like a perfect fit for me really. It has been a blessing to be able to work 
for them.  
 
So besides your dad wanting you to come over to Boeing to work with him, was 
there any other reason why you really wanted to work at Boeing? 
 
Not really, I guess I knew they paid well, and I knew all I had was a high school 
diploma and I needed somebody to teach me skills so I could provide for my family 
and they gave me skills and this is where I am at today, because of Boeing. 
 
Did your dad retire from Boeing? 
 
Yes, he did. Ahuh. 
 
Was it unusual for Boeing to hire someone that young at that time, 19? 
 
No not really, there were new programs coming in the 757, 767, so they had to tool 
up for those, and there was a demand for workers at that time, and uh, kind of the 
lot older guys, like I am now, you know, were getting to that point of retirement, 
they needed to train other people in, and the young ones were the future, so no, it 
was pretty, there was a bunch of us there were a whole bunch of us.  
 
You mentioned what you were doing a little bit, but what was your job title  at 
Boeing and what did you do? 
 
Plaster pattern maker and what we did was tool up, make tools uh that actually 
made parts for the planes. At that time they did every detail in house so there were 
no vendors, it was a lot of work, but we tooled up for the 757, 767, so they could pull 
skins and all that kind of stuff, yeah. 
 
It asks here, did you have to have special training? And you did, you said you had to 
go school, beyond that did you have training? 
 
You know, on the job training, you know there is nothing better than, you know, on 
the job training when you can, you know, work next to a veteran who has been 
doing this forever, and not everything the engineers would put on paper would 
work in the shop, so the old guys would know how to work a job and teach us how 
to do the same thing. So yeah, that is the best kind of training.  
 
Did you work on the commercial side, military side, both sides? 
 
I worked on the commercial side. Of course, we did some military work over there, 
because we were just one big tool shop at the time. So yeah, both sides, but 
predominately I was commercial.  
 
And when the commercial side split off what was that like? 
 
Well now, I happened to be on a leave of absence at that time, staffing as a 
community services liaison with the AFL CIO, so that’s been a blessing all in itself, 
because I got to stay attached to the Boeing Company. So, I am still considered a 
Boeing employee, been on a leave of absence for 10 years, well soon to be 11 years.  
 
I want to know more about that, but first, when you were working in tooling and 
such, what Boeing… all the aircraft industry goes up and down, what were those 
times like for you, were you every laid off? 
 
I’ve never been laid off, that’s been… again, kind of lucky, I have just been fortunate 
where things happen inside the tooling department, I mean, we weathered a lot of 
layoffs in the 80s, and I just was fortunate that we merged both plaster and plastics 
together an all the plaster guys came in first, because to build the patterns, and then 
the plastic guys came in second. So we were fortunate to get into the door first, and 
they had to leave before we did. It was, it got up to my year, but then again, they 
started instead of A through Z they started Z through A.  so again, I weathered it. So I 
have been very fortunate. There has not been very many people that can say they 
have not been laid off for over 30 years now.  
 
Wow. What was it like experiencing strike for the first time? 
 
You know, it was tough. But you know, when you work for justice in the workplace 
and try to make conditions safety conditions, you know, good in the workplace, get 
benefits. It is not always about the salary, it is other issues in the workplace. But it’s 
tough. I had three small children at the time. I have been through two strikes, and 
long strikes. Both in 89 and 95. And, it’s no fun. I brought my children and my wife 
with me on strike so they knew why dad wasn’t bringing home a check. So they 
knew what was going on. So it has just been something in my blood. Although, 
nobody wins probably in a strike, the result is hopefully you are going to have not 
only better benefits and salary but you know a safer workplace for everybody. You 
know, kind of justice in the workplace. So strikes are no fun, but something that you 
have to do from time to time.  
 
Will you talk a little bit about how you became so involved with the union, and how 
you got this position? 
 
Well, you know, I have always believed in organized labor even before I was 
organized labor because I worked in the meat packing industry and at that time they 
got rid of their union, at that time. And you know, I saw a lot of things going on in 
that workplace that, you know, unsafe conditions, long work hours, very little 
breaks, you know, and you couldn’t go to the rest room, unless it was on your break. 
You know, so you experience those rough times and you think, “well there’s got to 
be a better way.” And, organized labor gave me that opportunity once I got into 
Boeing, to try to advocate for the workplace, I call it justice in the workplace. You 
know, but, uh, that eventually led me to being kind of part of the team on the good 
neighbor fund at the time, which is their employee giving out there, which in turn 
part of it comes here to the United Way. So I sat on the board as board president a 
couple times, had a lot of activities with the non-profits around the city. So, I was a 
loan executive here, from Boeing, loaned to United Way for three months, prior to 
me coming here. So, this position was open at the time and so they kind of used me 
to contact organized labor, so I knew this was really something that I wanted to do. I 
love helping people, I love helping my community. Uh, so this kind of gave me an 
opportunity. But at that time, they shut down all the applications for the job, so I 
didn’t get the job. But in about a year and a half later it opened up and I knew that 
was what I wanted to do. And, there were like 27 other people that applied for the 
job at the time. And I was so fortunate to be a machinist, one. Because we are the 
largest union in the city. I think that gave me the real upper hand. And they knew 
that I was acting in the union, so our leadership, they got together… I am doing 
something I love, you know. 
 
What exactly do you do here? 
 
Well, my main focus I think here, is fundraising. To get all the organized labor on 
board and that is AFL CIO or Change to Win, because they all support United Way, 
and they have for over 75 years. Uh, I am one of over 200 liaisons that staff United 
Ways in over 100 communities throughout the country. We’re the voice of organized 
labor there, so we kind of bring in the unions and all their memberships to try to 
encourage it to give at a level to the United Way; whether that’s a dollar or two 
dollars or leadership giving. But then, my second role is direct services, uh, I get a lot 
of calls – probably 3 or 400 a year, uh, that need a helping hand up. Whether that’s a 
food box– in fact I operate a small little food pantry out of my central labor body, uh, 
so I am able to give them food, or maybe utility assistance or, you know, rent and 
mortgage, or therapy for a child. Or, today, I got a call looking for a bath chair. Uh, for 
someone who has surgery and needing a shower chair. So. You know, it’s kinda… 
and I extend my help to not just union members, but everybody in the community. 
Because I think the only thing folks know, especially here in Wichita, about 
organized labor is strikes. They don’t realize that millions of dollars goes to charities 
every year from men and women of organized labor. So as we do good, the 
community does well too. So.  
 
When you were still working at Boeing was there any um, I guess, not hostility, 
that’s not the right word… but from other people, other employees at Boeing that 
maybe didn’t agree with your stance on unions? 
 
Oh well, we have every body that works out there, you know? So they can argue or 
disagree with just about anything out there. But you know, you know there were 
some that weren’t members and we would try to encourage them to become 
members, but I don’t think it was every a friction really. Maybe ones or twosies, I 
think it is more hard– harder– when someone might cross our picket line and then 
you go back into the workplace where you have that, you know, wedge there for a 
little while. And some folks don’t forget that, you know, so. Um, but you know what? 
We are all one big family out there, you know. When you cross that gate in the 
morning it doesn’t say Cessna, LearJet, HawkerBeech Craft, you know, it says Boeing. 
We are with those folks more waking hours than we are with our own family, so you 
build that bond. So I think that’s kind of, I think that is probably what really 
devastated a lot of our workers. Is that we have given so much loyalty to the Boeing 
company. Although we’ve had strikes against it, we are still Boeing employees. But, 
so, it is kind of hard to see a family member go away. You know? Leave the house so 
to speak. Although I am a true blue fighting machine, you know, I am also a proud 
Boeing employee. 
 
Do you miss working at Boeing? 
 
I do. I miss my guys, I miss the folks out there and the guys and gals that you work 
with everyday. The camaraderie, you know. The horse play now and then that 
would make the day pass. You know? That is what I miss the most. You know, in the 
office, sure I get to leave the office, I get to visit the plant. But there is nothing like 
being there everyday, day in and day out. Now, I don’t miss it a whole lot, but I miss 
the guys. I don’t miss the workplace actually. I love my job, so I am doing a… I always 
say I am doing God’s work here. It sounds really corny I guess, but I just love helping 
people. It just gives me a new opportunity in life. 
 
(Noise from hallway, pause) 
 
My darn walls are so paper thin. They don’t build them like they used to. 
 
So, you already worked here when the commercial side split off. So are you still on 
leave from Boeing?  
 
I am still a Boeing employee. 
 
Is there still a position for you to go back to? 
 
Well, not now that they’ve closed. Getting ready to leave town. But you know, I built 
such good repoire with management, uh, at the Spirit side that used to be Boeing, 
that they are willing, I believe they would take me back. But you know, I don’t really 
want to go to Spirit, you know? Its just… I am a Boeing employee. I don’t know if I 
would even consider going anywhere with Boeing, because this is home. This is 
where I grew up, and all my family is from Kansas. So, you know, its, uh…. I don’t 
think there is an opportunity for me to go back. To go someplace else. 
 
I didn’t write this question, so I am not completely clear on this, but it says when 
Boeing and McDonnell Douglas got together did this cause an issue with the union? 
 
Yeah, well, you know, I was there at the time, of course. But I don’t remember there 
being much friction other than we didn’t want Harry to drive down our company 
that he.. Because he was in control of Boeing at the time, back, leaving McDonnell 
Douglas. So maybe we would wonder why they would let him, you know, run the 
company after he had just ran McDonnell Douglas into the ground. But I wasn’t 
aware of any friction. 
 
Um, do you participate in negotiations between Boeing and management? 
 
No I don’t. Otherwise as the AFLCIO community support liaison I will support the 
end result. And if that end result means there is going to be a work stoppage, then 
what I do is I go in and I train union counselors to be able to navigate their 
employees to assistance during the work stoppage– whether that is getting a food 
box, or any type of assistance, maybe health care or dental work or something like 
that. Yeah. 
 
Um, what is, and what was your impression of Boeing as a contributor to the Wichita 
community throughout its tenure here? 
 
Its been a big contributor, I am talking millions of dollars. You know, at one time 
there was over $3 million coming to United Way alone. Uh, and that’s not, that’s 
above and beyond what you know, they would give to small organizations, not only 
in Wichita non-United Way agencies, but our departments in our outlying 
communities. So you know, yeah, you are talking millions of dollars just going into 
the community. You know. Besides the good work that they do out there through 
volunteers and things that like. Yeah, it is going to be a big loss, a big loss.  
 
Um, You already mentioned this, too, but do you feel a sense of loyalty to the Boeing 
company, even now? 
 
Oh, absolutely, absolutely, yeah. Like I said, I am a Boeing employee, and I am proud 
to be a Boeing employee. You know, when I see, Sunday morning, about the 
commercials and the defense and protecting America, and that is Boeing. You know, 
it is a sense of pride, that we are helping out. It might be a little piece, but you know, 
we are all as Boeing employees at the end result providing these great products to 
keep America safe, to have America travel. So yeah, it is um, loyalty that um,… like I 
say you spend more waking hours out there then you do your own family, so you 
create bonds, one big bond was with the Boeing company. I can say I was proud 
every morning to cross that gate. 
 
Last year, last fall, no year before that. When Boeing announced that they would be 
withdrawing completely from Wichita what was your reaction when you heard that? 
 
Well, I was pretty shocked. You know, then you kind of wonder, what about me? You 
know, what happens to me. And I am not at that age yet where I can retire. I’ve got a 
couple more years, so I am hoping I am going to sneak that in before they shut the 
doors. In fact, I hope I am the one that turns the lights off and shuts the door. I am 
not sure that is going to happen though. It is devastating, it is like losing a family 
member. I know for one, I never thought that they would sell. You know? But then 
they sold. You know. I never thought they would leave Wichita. Especially with all 
the investment that Wichita and the county has invested in the Boeing company, you 
know? And then for all the hard work we did to union members and, you know, 
regular employees and Boeing did to get that KC135 work. You know? That fuel 
work. And then abandon us after it went. You know? Those were jobs. Those were 
good jobs in a community that’s been hurting for 4 or 5 years. So, yeah, it is 
devastating.  
 
Did you feel slighted at all? 
 
You know, I don’t know if I want to call it slighted or not. But you feel that at 
contract time. You know, you feel maybe slighted at contract time, but this time if 
felt like something different, you know? It felt like a stab to the heart, you know? 
Because, you know, again, you are loyal for over 30 years and the average worker 
out there is 50+, so where does a 50-year-old man go find employment when the 
only trade he knows is working with his hands? You know? There is hardly no other 
options out there for him. You know, they want the younger workers now at the 
other aircraft. You know, maybe a couple of experienced. There is no opportunities 
for us. For one, we are going to ask for more salary than the new ones are being 
paid. So the opportunities are… the doors are very small for us. 
 
Have you heard from other Boeing employees, union members… um, that are losing 
their jobs? 
 
Sure. I attend my union meeting every Saturday, or once a month on a Saturday. 
Yeah, we hear people are retiring, people are thinking about transferring, you know, 
to Seattle, because they have no choice, you know. But there is not a whole lot of 
them because they are like me– they want to stay here with their families. But there 
are a lot of them that are sacrificing right now. Keeping their families here and going 
over to Seattle working over there. And  I just heard one or two would be staying 
over there. And there will be more, I’m sure. But uh, yeah. It’s tough, it’s tough. Yeah.  
 
How do you think Wichita is going to be different with Boeing not here? 
 
You know to be honest I don’t really know if they are going to miss is now. Because 
everybody thinks Boeing is gone already with Spirit out there, the biggest chunk. 
You know? So I get people saying, “oh well, Boeing is still here?” when people ask me 
where I work. And I say, “Yeah, you know it is that little piece on this side of Oliver. 
It’s the military piece.” But you know, I think that the community has a sense that we 
are almost gone already, uh, but they are still there. We just don’t know how long 
yet. 
 
Do you think it will hurt the Wichita community? 
 
Oh, sure. Sure it will. You know, even the size they are now they are giving a half a 
million dollars to United Way. And you know, again, there’s going to be other 
charities that are going to benefit besides United Way. They do  a lot of good 
volunteer work, uh, the employees are really engaged, and I think that says a lot 
about all aircraft, in general – is that we are really good contributors to the 
community, so they are going to be missed, absolutely. 
 
Mike? 
 
(Film Guy: And be sure to talk to Briana. The airplanes you worked on were really 
leading edge type technology, I mean 757, 767… how did the technology on the new 
engines impact the union. 
 
Oh it did, because they don’t need as many workers. You know, to reel the plane. It 
used to be it’s in plant two, and there used to be a lot more rivet pounders, but 
through technology they have gone on to machines, computers, all set up and are 
doing a lot of the uh, riveting now. So yeah, we have seen a lot of change out there. 
They don’t need as big of a workforce as we did, you know, back in the day. Even my 
work, the plaster/pattern work, they don’t do it that way anymore. I am kind of like 
a dinosaur in that. It is all done on a digital, it is all computerized now. So, we don’t 
need to set up any mocks and sweep in a 41 section as big as a house. You know, so 
everything is done on computers. Yeah, I’ve seen a lot of change out there, a lot of 
change.  
 
(Film Guy: how do you feel when you read in the news about the problem the 
Dreamliner’s having?) 
 
Well, you know, maybe coming from the labor side the reason is we didn’t keep that 
in house. You know, when you offload and you go to vendors, you know, and those 
vendors they can’t do the work, so they offload it to another vendor, then it goes to 
another vendor. So you lose quality, you know. And, I don’t know who does the 
wiring, if that is China, or who is doing that wiring, but we used to build every little 
detail in plant two, or all the plants out there at Boeing, and now we just got so many 
other makers and you have to marry all those parts up, so sometimes that is 
difficult, absolutely.  
 
What do you hope to see happen to that plant? 
 
Well, gosh, it sounds crazy, but I would like to see Airbus come in it and put a line in 
there. You know, I think and you know ,those were our arch rivals. When I first got 
into Spirit, or after the divestiture, we went to the administration building where 
the red carpet is, leads out to the factory, and you know, for the first time I see 
“Welcome, Airbus” and it just sort of made my skin crawl. But that is what we need 
to do. We’ve had our eggs in one basket in aircraft, and we need to get some new– I 
know Airbus is aircraft, but maybe we need to get someone new in here. We’ve got 
the workforce, and they just want to work. So I think it would be a good thing for 
someone like Airbus to come in, but I don’t know if that is actually going to happen. 
It might be a Spirit place. 
 
(Film Guy: you know, of the four interviews that I have done, two of them Hispanic, 
the lady we talked to last time actually was a riveter on B29s, and she talked about 
how difficult it was for her, not only as a woman, but as a Hispanic. When you 
consider the size of the Hispanic community in south central Kansas, what was 
Boeing’s relationship with the Hispanic community? 
 
Well I think it was a good relationship, I think you know, a lot of the Hispanic 
workers came out of the packing plants, uh, and Cuttahay, Exel, so that kind of gave 
us… opened our horizons up a little bit where we could go into Boeing and learn a 
skill. And, I think the community, you know, like I say, Boeing was good to all the 
community. You know, not just the United Way, but they extended help to you know, 
a lot of different organizations, La Familia Senior Center for one, and I think they are 
going to be missed. And there is a good relationship, there were struggles at first, 
even with me coming in in 79, you know you think of civil rights, and you think well, 
a lot of that has been done, and you know, things are just perfect, but you know, 
there were struggles between the employees in there, but we learned to get along, 
we are all after one thing, and that was to make Boeing successful. But, I think the 
communities, whether it was the African American =community, Hispanic 
community, I think Boeing is just valuable to all those communities and helped build 
their people up, so we could do better. 
 
And the work environment for you when you were working at the plant, was it fair 
to minorities? 
I think it was. In the beginning, maybe you didn’t get the perfect jobs, some of the 
others got. From the lead man, or supervisor. Overtime, you had to prove yourself, 
and I am not saying that there weren’t any minorities in the tooling area, but there 
were ones and twosies there. Maybe that I can count on one hand. You know, but, 
once you learn: we are just people. You know, everybody. You know, I always tell 
everybody we are all brothers and sisters, you know. And we are all working for one 
thing: to make that company successful. So our families can be successful. You know, 
so I tell everybody, you know Boeing has provided a good living for me, I raised 
three wonderful children. And it is just hard to see them go. You do become loyal, 
even if you have strikes. You know, sure, for that short span you’ve got to, you know, 
you hate everybody at that time, you know, but then you go back and you learn to 
work together in the end, but you know we are striving to do, again, to make Boeing 
successful.
