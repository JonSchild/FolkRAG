NSOP7dISTICATED LOVE. 
End song. 
Sarv.; by Aacau; W HITE With DI:l'IZEZ and BENEDICT'S 
THE gal that I 
love is both tall and serene, 
Her teeth are bran new, and her cheeks are so green, 
Her voice is as sweet as the tones of a 
mule, 
Her uncle's a 
sailor, her brother's a 
fool. 
She can chew all day long on a 
big lump of gum, 
Like a 
freckled faced boy with a 
wart on his thumb, 
Her appetite's good, she'd devour with great ease, 
A 
couple of tons of old limburger cheese. 
CHORUS. 
She had a great love for the new silver dollars, 
She looks like a 
fairy in clean paper collars, 
When she opens her head the inside can be seen, 
No " taffy " at all, she's a 
lovely sardine. 
She owns a 
big farm where the bull frogs do grow, 
She raises a 
crop of the best kind of snow ; 
I 
gave her my picture dressed in my best toga, 
And she put it in the sty for to frighten the hogs. 
She wears a 
glass eye, and its color is red, 
She's a 
big bunch of feathers attached to her head, 
She can talk broken Chinese iu seventeen tongues, 
And blow down a 
house with her cast iron lungs. 
She had, etc. 
I 
never can tell all her beauties at once, 
She calls me a 
sugar-coated galvanized dunce ; 
When she kisses me with her big mouth open wide, 
There's room enough in it for an elephant to ride. 
If she ever got mad she'd pulverize your jaw 
With one little swipe of her delicate paw ; 
What shall I 
say of her gaiters to wear ? 
It takes forty big co wskins to make her a 
pair. 
She had, etc. 
THAT'S WHERE I'D LIKE TO BE, 
Old. Man's Sour. 
Sung by Ancan: 
THERE'S a 
spot in the sunny South, 
Where the orange blossoms grow ; 
'Where the mocking bird sings in the trees, 
And glistening waters flow, 
'My heart longs for that paradise, 
'And in my dreams I 
see 
The cotton fields as white as snow. 
Oh, that's where I'd like to be. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, take me back, I 
want to go, 
1\1-v- childhood's home to 
In Alabama's sunny land, 
That's where I'd like to be. 
I 
remember when I 
left that place, 
'Twas many years ago, 
thought to find a 
fairer spot, 
But sad my heart does grow. 
I'm all alone, no loving words 
Are spoken now to me, 
My dear old friends are far away. 
Oh, that's where I'd like to be. 
Oh, take me back, etc.

That can bate the bon-ton of Bidalia Jane McCann. 
Her education's wonderful, 
She spells and writes by ear, 
She plays the " Maiden's Prairie," 
And she sings " Beloved Ear." 
She says " I 
feel so fatigayed 
I 
don't know what to do." 
Says I, " Bidalia, some grub and ale 
Might help your fatigu." 
Bidalia Jane, etc. 
She gives a " German " ev'ry week, 
An " Irish " too as well. 
She says a 
cork would shade my face, 
So I 
could tend the bell ; 
She sings duets all by herself, 
She talks French like a

She's very mirevore indeed,

Such dincin' and singin' and jolly sport have we ; 
Our picnics bate them all without, denial, a

Would set you wild with pleasure, at the Twilight Coterie, 
It's dance, and prance, and catch the motion easy, 
And in a 
whirl, swing your girl, now we're off in style,

And still the fiddles and the horns are soundin' while 
boundin', 
Are all the merry spielers of the Twilight Coterie,

Then it's on a 
summer's night up in the Park, my boys, 
Where the merry girls are dancin' and singin' light and 
free, 
Hands around, and round, and round, oh ! what a 
lark, 
my boys, 
How the spielers prance, at the moon- light dance of filo 
Twilight Coterie. 
There's honor'd delegations from the " Starlighth" and 
"Skylights," 
The " Ours" and " Yours," and other Coteries, 
Together with their friends and all their ladies, the daisies, 
Invited guests, whose hearts are bless'd with all the beer 
they please ; 
It's skip, and dip, and sachez round in glory, 
0 Kate asthore ! bang the floor ! 
That's the style of girl 
for me, 
Anti so around we balance and each daisy is crazy 
Wid great hilarity, all at the Twilight Coterie.

YOU TELL ME THAT YOU LOVE ME. 
Written by EDDIE SA.N1.14., and sung by Ii.,,LATING and SANDS. 
Am.—" Hand in Hand We Wander." 
You tell me that you love me 
With a 
passion pure and high 
As the heavens that bend above me, 
When the day-god warms the sky ; 
You vow that you will cherish 
My memory whilst you live, 
That you will let no feeling perish, 
While you've life-blood yet to give,. 
You say that you are truthful 
As aught beneath the sun, 
That you will let no ivy ruthfld. 
My flowers of bliss o'errun ; 
Yet of hearts I'm an inspector, 
And I 
know thine, link by link, 
At its founts of bubbling nectar, 
Any one that will may drink.

It for me, my dainty lip 
Will never taste the renish 
From the goblet others

Of all the mem'ries of the past, 
That come like summer dreams, 
Whose rainbow hues still 'round us cast 
Their bright— their bright but fleeting beams; 
The dearest, sweetest that can be, 
Of days long gone before, 
Are those that oft recall to me,— 
Scissors grinding, dot's my business, 
You could seen alroady ; 
Ven every one got someding to grind 
Dot made de business steady.

Oh, he kissed her, and she kissed him, 
And they kissed one another ; 
The one she gave was for his dad, 
While he " smacked " her for mother. 
He said, " how sweet !" she said, " how nice 
It is to have a 
cousin ! " 
And then she kissed him several times, 
While he gave her a 
dozen ! 
Oh, he kissed her, and she kissed him, 
And they kissed one another ;

And he lived in the laud of the free ;

Which hung way down to his heels.

As fishes in the Nell, 
They ate me out of house and home 
And destroyed my family. 
There's her father, and her mother, 
And her sister, and her brother, 
1700 babies laying on their knees ; 
Her uncles and her Cousins, 
Her aunties by the dozens, 
Lived upon the earnings of Patrick Maloney !

About ten years ago,

It was only six months after, 
She named my wedding day.

All the little children 
Sang so sweet to me ; 
Ladies came in earriac.e::. 
With preents and bouquets, 
To little Michel 
Upon his wedding day. 
It was on a 
Saturday evening, 
With laugh and merry shout, 
The boys and girls in the neighborhood, 
So gayly did turn out ; 
The old folks dressed their very best, 
And had fanny things to say 
To Mike and Lena Callihan, 
Upon their wedding day. 
Ring a 
wreath of roses, etc. 
There was Aug ust Schmitt and Kunkle, 
And Henry r'Ciselmyer, 
With all my wife's relations,

But the Germans tried to kill them when 
They tried to kiss the bride.

PRETTY LITTLE VIOLET. 
SONG AND DANCE. 
Written and sung by ARCHIE W RITE and ELLA EsmoND. 
On I 
I'm deep in love, as you call plainly see, 
With a 
darling little fascinating belle ; 
I 
met her out, ' twits on a 
summer's eve, 
While rambling through the dell. 
She looked at me, I 
looked at her, 
Those smiles I'll ne'er forget ; 
And since that time I've called her mine, 
This pretty little Violet. 
CHORCS. 
Oh, yes ! she's all this world to me, 
Laughing, joking, full of joy and glee ; 
(
Syrn.) 
Oh ! Cupid's dart has pierced my heart, 
And I 
hope 
not regret 
When first I 
met 
This charming little pet, 
My pretty little Violet. 
(Dance.) 
Oh I 
she promised that she'd meet me here to- night, 
And here she'll surely be; 
For every night she's sure to meet me hem 
To sing and dance with me, 
asked her if she'd name the happy day 
That her and I 
should wed, 
She said the knot would soon be tied 
And she would be my bride, 
This pretty little Violet. 
Oh, yes ! she's all this world, etc. 
Origiiz,1iytillag by BILLY CAIZTLIL 
YOU see before you a 
married man, 
You can tell that by my looks; 
For the last two years I've spent my time, 
In dodging plates and books ; 
My wife is a 
female Samson, 
As a 
boxer she beats the deck, 
She fought a 
hundred rounds under water 
With a 
grindstone around her neck. 
For she juggles light and heavy weights 
From midnight until morn, 
I 
never saw such muscle 
Since the hour that I 
was born ; 
She won't eat anything but gravel 
And water mixed with flour, 
For she's training to walk a 
thousand miles 
In a 
thousand quarter hours. 
The house looks like a 
race track, 
She's given me the blues, 
For she's walking in there from morn till night, 
And wearing out all my shoes 
She hasn't slept for thirteen weeks, 
Her feet are tied up in a 
sack, 
She says she'll beat Madame Anderson's time, 
Or perish on the track. 
THOUSAND QUARTER HOURS.—Conclude,d. 
Oh I 
the room is only six by nine, 
A 
little out of style, 
She has to make a 
million laps 
Before she makes a 
mile ; 
The kids are yelling for soothing syrup, 
And howling with all their power, 
While their ma is walking a 
thousand miles 
In a 
thousand quarter hours. 
Her feet are like two pumpkins, 
This pedestrian baby mine, 
She's kept me awake the last two weeks 
A 
marking down her time ; 
She has fifty warts on the back of her neck, 
She's blind and cannot see. 
If she wins I'll give her a 
chromo, 
And a 
club and a 
pound of 'tea. 
But I 
hope she comes in way behind, 
I 
hope she will get beat, 
For she races every fire engine 
She meets upon the street ; 
She wanted to match O'Leary to walk 
For a 
keg of Italian flour, 
But he advised her to bed to soak her head 
For a 
thousand million hours.

I 
MET MY LOVE IN SPRING—TIME, 
SONG AND DANCE. 
Sang by ELLA ESMOND. 
OH ! 
I 
met my love in spring- time, 
When the birds were 011 the wing ; 
She was tripping, tripping through the meadow, 
When I 
heard her gayly sing. 
! 
the sweet young flowers around her 
Seemed to know as she went by; 
her month was like a 
rosebud, 
And her eyes were like the sky. 
She's the prettiest little blossom, 
And I 
love her so ; 
She's sweeter than the roses 
In the morning glow. 
I 
never shall forget her, 
Since the first time that I 
met her, 
She's the dearest little one I 
know, 
Oh ! we rambled through the meadows, 
And I 
took her hand in mine ; 
When she smiled so sweetly on me. 
And I 
thought she was divine, 
How I 
told her that I 
loved her 
And to me she was so dear, 
That her love would be in spring- time 
As every month that's in the year. 
She's the prettiest, etc.

In spite of sadness that grief cloth bring ; 
The hurrying throng will pa„is heedless by

For me no more the world is bright.

To meet my love whose heart so true,

I KEEP an actor's boarding-house hero in the city, 
All the gang about the town says l'in the boss, 
From the leading lady down to the back line of the ballet. 
Oa all the gang I 
have money lost. 
I've got a 
little (laughter that's struck upon the stage, 
And I 
fear that's been ordained by late ; 
She went out the other night with a 
couple of the gang, 
When she came home situ said, " l've got a 
date." 
CHORUS. 
She's going on the stage, ain't it funny, (Bus.) 
They're going to use her for a 
dummy, (
Bus.) 
She must paint, powder and galvanize her face, 
Or she'll never make a 
hit in the world. 
She gets a 
letter every day from little Johnny Shay, 
And wants to double up with Amelia Dean ; 
Sh e does a 
walk round to her litle song and dance, 
And they say it i he dizziest ever seen. 
She's got a 
lithoraph of the L?rrible danger, Norton, 
Her eyes on Watson and Ellis she wants to feast, 
She's sitting on the end at Harry Hill's 
Waiting for Dr. Landis to coma East. 
CI1011.17F4. 
Six dollars a 
week is her salary, (

Three she gives up to the gallery, (Bus) 
She kicked, got fired clean out of the place, 
Now she's biscuit shooting in our boarding-house.

And blushes like a

Keeps nodding to the gentle breeze, 
With rosy perfume laden ; 
To greet a

For her my heart is yearning ; 
And lately I 
ant scarce myself, 
My heart with love is blooming,

Little Cherry Blossom, will you wed me ? 
While the stars are twinkling in the silent dell 
Such a

The lily all proclaim so fair, 
She is the queen of flowers ; 
The rose, they say, conveys true love, 
'Mid Cupid's shining bowers ; 
The Pansie says, ' forget me not ! " 
The Laurel crowns with glory, 
The one that's fairer titan the lot, 
The subject of my story,

The dew upon the rose is like 
The tears that she is shedding, 
Impatient for a

For soon there'll be a

And from life's garden I

A 
fair and fragrant flower, 
And keep it blooming all my life, 
Within love's happy bower.

'TwAs on a 
stormy winter's night, 
The snow was falling fast ; 
A 
mother and two little babes 
Were wandering through the blast. 
Still clinging to their mother's breast, 
The little ones would cry, 
Please, mamma, won't you make us warm ? 
0, mamma, we will die. 
CHORUS. 
Toll the village bell, 
Let all good people know, 
'Twas on that dreadful stormy night 
Three perished in the snow. • 
When morning dawned the sun came out, 
The snow was melting fast ; 
Three darling forms lay side by side, 
in one fond, loving clasp. 
A 
farmer heard the sad, sad news, 
That made him weep to know, 
That from his house not twenty rods, 
Three perished in the snow.

To me he is certain to come, 
\\ill send him there as sure as fate, 
If he planks down a

So, if any of you wants to be Governor, 
Come and have a

And if we can come to arrangements 
Why, Governor you surely will be ;

And cigars and whiskey too ; 
Now, what wealth do you think you'll stand ? 
Just say a 
thousand or two. 
Oh, Paddy McCoy, etc.

Bat I

thought it my duty,--
Cajoled by a

Oh, now matrimony's perplexing,

His answers are ugly and vexing, 
And very insulting to me.

Marry, marry ! 
What a

And give her freedom up ! 
Not home yet !

SONG AND DANCE. 
Written by FRANK DUMONT. 
Sung by Fox and W ARD. 
'TWAS in the sunny month of .May, 
The birds were sweetly singing, 
And in the dells and valleys 
The summer flowers were springing. 
When playing croquet on the lawn, 
Such sweet one I 
did see ; 
And soon my heart did throb with joy, 
For she turned and smiled at me. 
CHOIR'S. 
And she says I 
stole her heart, 
My love for her shall never depart; 
She's gay as the birds that sweetly sing 
In the vales or shady bowers. 
To me she's dear and just as sweet 
As the balm of a 
thousand flowers. 
One eve we sat beneath the trees, 
And I 
asked her to be mine; 
She whispered with a 
sigh, 
" 
Yes, dearest, I'll be thine." 
And now together, hand in hand, 
We share our joys and strife; 
Sweet as the balm of a 
thousand flowers 
Is my darling little wife. 
And she says. I 
stole, etc.

W HO rides yonder, proud and gay, 
Spurning the dust on the King's Highway ? 
Lord of thousand acres wide, 
While I, the beggar, must stand aside! 
Go thy way! let me go mine; 
I 
to beg, and thou to dine: 
Scatter the dust on the King's Highway, 
But room for the beggar, room I 
say. 
Fair and free, night and day, 
Fair and free is the King's Highway; 
Fair and free, night and day, 
Fair and free is the King's Highway. 
Hug thyself in wealth of state, 
Empty purse has a 
careless gait; 
Thou must watch thy chests and bags, 
None would steal tkie beggar's rags. 
Wine for thee, for me a 
crust, 
King and beggar, they both are dust ; 
And dust to dust will be borne one day, 
High and low on the King's Highway. 
Fair and free, night and day ; 
Fair and free is the King's Highway. 
Fair and free, night and day; 
Fair and free is the King's Highway. 
Dainty maid of high degree, 
What has the beggar to do with thee ? 
Thy life is morn, and love is May; 
What has the beggar to thee to say ? 
Gentle word hast thou for me, 
Tears are in ray heart for thee; 
Ali, that thou should'st fade one day, 
E'en as I, on the great Highway! 
Fair and free, night and day; 
Fair and free is the King's Highway, 
Fair and free, night and clay; 
• Fair and free is the King's, the King's Highway.

For being sweet, could ne'er compete 
With darling Isabel. 
On Sunday eve, at half-past eight, 
I

Down by the little rustic gate, 
She's waiting there for me ; 
I 
take her arm, we stroll along 
Where the silvery moonbeams play. 
Ben.ath the shade of the greenwood glade, 
My love and I

I

Her name I'd never tell.

HUNT. 
They tell me I 
am too bashful by far, 
And sometimes I 
think they are right,. 
But so awfully naughty the masculines are, 
No wonder one feels in a 
fright. 
I've been led to believe men were born to deceive, 
So when they their compliments pay, 
In language absurd, I 
don't hear a 
word, 
But first as a 
caution I 
say: 
CHORUS. 
Go away, get along, go along, get away, 
You don't say what you mean, or mean what you say; 
Go away, naughty boy, go ever so far, 
You are so awfully awful, you are. 
Go away, get along, go along, get away, 
-You don't say what you mean, or mean what you say; 
Go away, naughty boy, go ever so far, 
You are so awfully awful, you are. 
When I 
go to a 
ball, and one asks me to dance, 
At the finish I 
soon slip away, 
For I 
know Mr. Noodle, if he has the chance, 
Is sure to have something to say; 
So I 
stop the sad man as soon as I 
can, 
In case he'd be going too far, 
Perhaps what he'd tell me he has told two or three, 
For such sad Don Giovanis they are. 
Go away, etc. 
I 
dread Christmas time whene'er it comes ' round, 
'Tho' it's awfully jolly, I 
know, 
But so many young men, again and again, 
Lead me under the mistletoe; 
Oh I 
would you believe, on last Christmas eve, 
I 
found a 
young man at my feet, 
With an offer of marriage, a 
mansion and carriage, 
Of course I 
soon beat a 
retreat. 
Go away, ate.

I'm dancing, singing all the day, 
The ladies' pet and joy. 
I'm number one on style, you know, 
On that you bet your pile, 
And my name is Charles Augustus William Brown, 
CHORUS. 
So I'm bound to beat the style of all the " mashers," 
That's the reason I'm so nobby and so dashing, 
I'm a 
loose and careless little nig, 
Look out for me, I'm bad, 
And my name is Charles Augustus William Brown. 
I'm always to be seen upon 
The fashionable parade; 
My fascinating figure 
Throws all others in the shade. 
All the darlings they go crazy, 
As they see me pass along. 
For they're sweet on Charles Augustus William Brown.

Whoa, ho, Mare! Whoa! Whoa, ho I 
Whoa, ho! 
My love to Bridget Flynn did broach— 
Whoa, ho, Mare ! Whoa! Whoa, ho ! 
Bat sure she wants to wear the pants; she likes her beer, 
And every day when I'm away she acts so queer, 
Will wink her eye at passers-by, so devilish sly, 
Whoa, ho, Mare I Whoa ! Whoa, ho! 
CHORUS. 
A 
hackman's wife from flirting should be free; 
Whoa, ho I 
such games wont do for me; 
A 
hackman's wife a 
hackman's star should be— 
Her poker makes me stars to see. 
The other night an awful sight— 
Whoa, Mare! Whoa ! Whoa, ho I 
Did cause poor Dennis's heart to blight— 
Whoa, ho, Mare ! 
Whoa! Whoa, ho ! 
I 
loud did yelp for aid and help, but I 
was beat ; 
I 
saw a 
man as off he ran, way down the street. 
He left his coat, the scheming bloat, on it was wrote, 
Whoa, ho, Mare 
Whoa! Whoa, ho ! 
A 
hackman's wife, etc. 
I 
couldn't stand like Gideon's Band— 
Whoa, ho, Mare! Whoa I 
Whoa, ho! Whoa, ho! 
Came all the blackguards in the land, 
Whoa, ho, Mare ! 
Whoa ! 'Whoa, ho! 
So I'm again a 
single man, as you can see; 
Untied the band, no partner plan would do for me. 
I've sold my coach, and Biddy Roach is in the lurch;

THE SONGS MY MOTHER USED TO SING. 
Sung by SAN. DEVERE. 
TICE songs my mother used to sing, 
Could I 
but hear them once again. 
To childhood's memories still they cling, 
They soothed my every ache and pain. 
Oh! how sweet they used to seem, 
How they made my heart rejoice; 
Years, long years seem but a 
dream, 
Still I 
hear my mother's voice. 
CHORUS. 
Childhood's days to me so dear, 
Sweetest recollections cling; 
How I 
often long to hear 
The songs my mother used to sing. 
Those sweet and simple little songs, 
Songs I 
love so well to hear; 
How they'd heal my childish wrongs, 
How they'd seem to please and cheer. 
Songs in memory buried deep, 
Songs that oft put me to rest, 
Songs that closed my eyes in sleep, 
Lying on my mother's breast. 
Childhood's days to me, etc. 
Every simple little strain, 
Calls to mind some happy scene, 
Brings up childhood's days again, 
Days to me yet fresh and green ; 
Better to me than glittering gold, 
Greater by far than crown of king; 
Dearer to me than all the world, 
Are the songs my mother used to sing. 
Childhood's days to me, ate,

On, I'm one that's fond of pleasure; 
It is my greatest pride, 
And in my hours of leisure 
To go toddling thro' the glide. 
0, give to me the outside sport, 
It is so gay and airy,. 
For all the boys around the park 
They call me Boston-

With my tita la, oh, tita la! 
Wherever I 
may go, • 
I'm one that's fond of pleasure, 
Is Boston Mary, oh. 
With my tita la, my tita ht ! 
Wherever I 
may lark, 
You bet I 
have the best costume 
Of any of the girls in the park. 
I 
have a 
charming sweetheart, 
And Joey, that's his name; 
At summer time often on the lawn 
We play the croquet game. 
Oh, do I 
not admire it ? 
My chance I 
would not miss; 
Before my petty parts with me 
His darling he must kiss. 
With my tita la, etc. 
One evening, while out rambling— 
'Twas shortly after dark— 
My Joe and I 
went meandering 
'

One asked me to pay 'a visit 'With him

DOWN AMONG THE DATSIES. 
Down among the daisies, by the running stream, 
Where the waters ripple soft and low; 
Sitting with my darling, in a 
happy dream, 
Heedless of the hours that come and go. 
There I 
meet my darling every summer's day, 
And the leaflets nodding up above 
Wore the only ones that list to what we'd say, 
As we whispered o'er our tales of love. 
Crionrs. 
Down among the daisies, by the running stream, 
Where the waters ripple soft and low ; 
Sitting by my darling, in a 
happy dream, 
Heedless of the hours that come and go. 
Down among the daisies we will ever dwell, 
In a 
little cottage by the stream; 
Naught will ever come to break the happy spell, 
Break the happy glimmer of our dream. 
Days may come and go, like flowers that bloom and die, 
But as long as life is with us, queen, 
We will dwell together, you and I, 
Down among-the daisies by the treatn.

Of the troubles of a 
nice young gal I'll tell, 
Oh, she was a 
South Fifth Avenue belle; 
There was a 
tall, short, thick set built man, 
Who was mashed on Liz 7ileGruder; 
Wherever she went, she was never content, 
For the villain still pursued her. 
She washed her face and wiped her nose, 
Then dressed herself in her .Sunday clothes; 
As stiff as starch was the dress she wore, 
She was an ironer, a 
w.isher and a 
fluter, 
On her head was a 
wreath, and she wore false teeth, 
But the villain still pursued her. 
0, the ducks and the geese were a- singing in the trees, 
The air was soft with a 
clammy breeze; 
At the hour of twelve on a 
moonlight night. 
She went to meet her suitor, 
She slipped on a 
pie, run the crust in her eye, 
But the villain still pursued her. 
One day she went in a 
Dutchman's store, 
Her dress was bruised and her eye was tore; 
Oh, she tried to conceal in her pocketbook a 
ham 
And the Dutchman then did shoot her ; 
She fell on her knees with a 
mouthful of cheese, 
And the villain still pursued her. 
Written and sung by SAM DEVERE. 
Calico Ike was a 
nice young man, 
lie was clerk in a 
dry goods store; 
His hair was blue and his eyes were red, 
All the girls did him adore. 
One night he imbibed too much hair tonic 
With a 
friend out late it seems; 
And they both went home and fell in bed, 
To wander in the land of dreams. 
Ike dreamt that linens and calicoes 
Were piled up mountains high, 
And rich old dames with daughters fair, 
Were walking in to buy. 
He dreamt that hustles flew in the air, 
That whiskey ran in a 
stream ; 
The 'skeeters and bed-bugs had a 
picnic, 
While this dry goods clerk did dream. 
Ike dreamt of one young fairy form, 
Who cut a 
gorgeous shine, 
That walked into his dry goods store, 
For muslin, superfine. 
He dreamt be was tearing off seven yards, 
Then something went ker smack, 
His friend jumped up with his night shirt torn 
Rer flip right up the back.

THE GIRLEMNi S ON OUR BLOCK.

Written by Thomas POWER3. 
Sang by JATZ CONROY and Lim 
Sarrrn. 
Copyright., 1879, by CLINTON T. 
DE Wrrr. 
IF 
you want an hour's diversion in seeing funny tricks, 
Walk over with in 
silently to Casey's row of bricks ; 
There'll you see Paul Casey, a 
cradle he does rock, 
Surrounded by young " gammons " and the girleens on 
our bluek. 
There's the Cmoys and Laceys, from the divil knows 
where, 
Throwing packs of firecrackers 'neath grandfather's rock-
ing chair, 
And sitting in the yard at night all drinking -rye and rock, 
Singing ring a 
ring a 
rosey with the girleens on our 
block. 
CHORUS. 
Ring a 
ring a rosey, a 
bottle full of rye, 
My darling is a 
posey and lives on lemon pie; 
Casey cries all hands around, the cradle we will rock, 
Is sung by all the girleens boarding on our block. 
Of a 
warm night in summer, on the roof we try to sleep, 
The blackguards from the corners on their hands and 
feet do creep, 
They have a 
big stinted bladder, they crib us an awful 
sock, 
Which creates a 
roar of laughter from the girleens on our 
block.

THE GIRLEEWS ON OUR BLOCK.—Concluded. 
There's the Ryans and Bryaus. men of sensibility, 
Dancing Irish jigs and reels with ease and gentility. 
All the neighbors' child.er playing duck upon a 
rock, 
A 
fireman for me, is sung by the girleens on our block. 
CifOliUS. 
A 
fireman, a 
fireman, a 
dirt cartman for me, 
If ever I 
get married a 
fireman's wife I'll ; 
Casey cries all hands around, the cradle we will rock, 
Is sung by all the girleens boarding on our block. 
Good morning, Raudeen Murphy, your head is swelled 
to-day, 
Go tell your wife it's now her turn to scrub the alleyway, 
Bay soft soap in the Dutchman's, get a 
lump of salt rock, 
My mother will assist her with the girls on the block. 
Faith they rubbed and scrubbed till the sun went down 
the west, 
It was ten o'clock at night before they took a 
rest. 
Casey cries, all hands around, the cradle we will rock, 
Is sung by all the babies living on our block,

ONLY THE WAY ON THE STAGE:' ' 
Song of the Times, composed and sung by FRED. J. 
MAcaury 
IF you listen to me, some facts I 
will mention, 
Concerning the past and the present strange age, 
And in them, my friends, to you I'll relate, 
Some things I 
saw one night and played on the stage: 
I 
came to this city with one or two friends, 
And went for a 
stroll, they seemed quite amazed, 
When we read on the bills of the Bowery Theatre, 
And found a 
new Drama was played on the stage, 
The first scene I 
saw was a 
street in New York, 
There a 
poor woman begging, she quite old in age, 
Those sad means she tried to keep her from starving, 
A 
very sad lesson, of life's book a 
page ; 
But a 
policeman passed by, his face seemed all smiles, 
Placed his hand in his pocket and drew forth his wages, 
And he gave part to help this poor wretched woman, 
But ' twas only the way it was played on the stage. 
The scene it then changed from a 
street to a 
court room, 
There a 
prisoner on trial for a 
crime very sad, 
He'd murdered a 
man, by the people respected, 
And the court room was crowded with people so glad 
To see that man punished for the crime he committed ; 
The jury looked stern, and the judge in a 
rage, 
And they hung that rich man for the murder of Fisk, 
But it was only the way it was played on the stage. 
In the next scene I 
saw a 
clergyman from Brooklyn, 
Who was dancing a 
hornpipe, and seemed quite the rage, 
Another one from Jersey was. playing the 
The audience in front lyith wonderment gazed ; 
For just at that minute a 
party named Tilton 
Then gave a 
fine sermon on the morals Of the age, 
And I 
thought that they practised each sermon they. preached; 
But it was only the way it was played on the stage. 
CUSTODIANS OF THE PEACE. 
Written by HARRY RICHMOND. Sung with great applause by ARCHIE 
W HITE and ELLA ESMOND. 
BEHOLD this squad of bold police 
Custodians of the law; 
A 
finer squad of officers 
This city never saw; 
And when down Broadway we do march 
In front of a 
parade, 
The rest of the procession's left 
Completely in the shade. 
The ladies smile, 
(
Sym.) 
They like our style, 
(
Sym.) 
And the boys do shout hurrah; 
The never-sweats, 
(
Sym.) 
The ladies' pets. (Sym.) 
The cream de la cream we are, we are, we are. 
CHORUS. 
The Broadway squad, the Broadway squad, 
Oh ! don't they all look gay; 
Oh ! look at the " bobby," oh, isn't he nobby! 
They're coming down this way. 
The Broadway squad, the Broadway squad, 
The finest of police, 
Bold, defiant, brave and true, 
- 
Custo-dians of the peace.

STUAWRERRIES AND C41:A.M. 
Composed and written by W . 
II. 
DELEHANTY. 
Muzi.. and honey, oh ! its funny— 
I 
eannot keep from dancing ; 
For I 
love a 
girl—she's a 
pretty pearl— 
A 
lovely belle supreme— 
She's a 
lolly-pop---sweet forget-me-not— 
And her voice is so entrancing, 
She's my honeycomb, she's my sugar-plum, 
She's strawberries and cream. 
Yes, she's a 
basket full of fruit, 
She's my pretty love, she's my turtle dove, 
Her voice is like the music of a 
flute, 
And she's just sweet sixteen. 
CHORUS. 
Milk, honey, strawberries and cream, (sym.) 
Like the music of a 
happy dream, (
sym.) 
She's a 
darling ! she's a 
daisy, 
She's a 
lovely plate of peaches, 
She's a 
dandy— gasses candy— 
She's strawberries and cream. (
repeat chorus.) 
I'm enraptured, I 
am captured. 
By a 
lovely lump of sweetness. 
She's an oyster pie, she's a 
chicken pie, 
And she haunts my every dream. 
She's a 
little maid, she's a 
lemonade. 
And the pink of perfect neatness. 
She's a 
box of dates, she's a 
bunch of grape, 
She's strawberries and cream. 
Oh! yes, she's far too sweet to live, 
Is this lay-pop, is this candy shop, 
And her loss I 
know that I 
would grieve--
Sweet vision of my dream.

A LOCK OF MY MOTHER'S HAIR. 
Written by FRANK Duxosr. Sung with great success by ELLA ESXOND. 
I'vn a 
letter that was written long ago, 
'Ti.3 a 
letter that I've kept for many years; 
And, oh I 
how oft I've read those fading lines, 
And over them there's traces of my tears. 
She sent to me her blessing in this missive, 
To See 111.3 was her constant holy prayer ; 
The little lock of gray in this old letter 
Is a 
lock of my angel mother's hair. 
CHORUS. 
I've a 
letter that was written long ago, 
Ms a 
letter that I 
keep with tender care; 
The little lock of gray in this old letter 
Is a 
lock of my angel mother's hair. 
I've a 
letter that was written long ago, 
'Tis a 
missive that was sent me ' cross the sea ; 
When ' mong strangers I 
was wand'ring far away, 
And longing home again to ever be. 
Bat underneath the sod my mother's sleeping, 
She's free from earthly trials and its care, 
But ever next my heart I'll keep her letter, 
And the lock of my angel mother's hair. 
I've a 
letter, etc.

DANCING IN THE SUNLIGHT. 
Written and composed by JANE M AAs for the GIRARD BROTHERS, and 
9ung by them with immense success, at the Howard Atheneum, 
Boston. 
W HAT a 
pleasure there is in dancing in the sunlight, 
-When all earth seems to smile; 
It makes a 
merry ringing in your laughter, 
You have no care or guile. 
With ringing notes from pearly throats, 
We while the hours away ; 
With beaming smile our time beguile, 
We are always blithe and gay. 
Oh, what a 
pleasure there is dancing in the sunlight, 
When all earth seems to smile ; 
It makes a 
merry ringing in your laughter, 
You have no care or guile. 
CHORUS. 
Hark, hark ! hear the music ring, (
syin.) 
Shout, shout! raise your voice and sing. (syns.) 
What a 
pleasure there is dancing in the sunlight, 
When all earth seems to smile ; 
It makes a 
merry ringing in your laughter, 
You have no care or guile. 
What a 
pleasure there is dancing in the sunlight, 
For it will make you glad ; 
In the golden rays its shadow it will mock you, 
And whirl and dance like mad. 
When sunset's come, and day is done, 
And darkness claims her right, 
We'll go to rest, and the blest, 
The rays of morning light. 
Oh ! What a 
pleasure there is dancing in the sunlight, 
When all earth seems to smile ; 
It makes a 
merry ringing in your laughter, 
You have no care or guile. 
Hark, hark, et&

HER FRONT NAME IS HANNER. 
As sung by LARRY TOOLEY. 
The heart in my bosom has lately been stolen, 
By a 
sweet blushing maiden, just nineteen years old; 
She's half Irish, blonde, and likes pork and beans, 
He feet are a 
feature—she wears seventeens. 
CHORUS. 
Her front name is Harmer, 
Her father's a 
tanner, 
Him she does hammer, 
In an artistic manner; 
She sings " Star Spangled Banner," 
And " A 
Lean Banana." 
With tooth brush I 
fan her, 
When she thumps the pianner. 
She wears a 
moire antique pull back, cost six cents a 
yard, 
Her hat and parasol are made out of lard; 
She shall be a 
lady, like Judy O'Grady, 
For I've wealth (to get) and will keep it shady. 
Her front name, eto. 
Her mouth—well, it stretches from ear to ear. 
Whenever it's open I'm afraid to go near. 
Whenever she talks I'm never around, 
For I'm sure I'd fall in, and I 
know I'd get drowned. 
Her front name, eta. 
SIX FEET OF EARTH. 
I'LL relate to you now of the world and its ways, 
And many strange people we meet ; 
From the rich man that rolls in his millions of wealth, 
To the poor starving wretch on the street. 
A 
man may be poor, and in tatters and rags, 
Though we ne'er should affect to despise, 
But think of the adage, and remember, my friends, 
That six feet of earth makes us all of one size. 
There's many a 
coat that is tattered and torn, 
Covers many a 
brave manly heart, 
But if he's not dressed like his neighboring self, 
Society keeps him apart. 
On one fortune smiles, while the other one fails, 
No matter what venture he tries, 
Till time in the end calls both to the grave, 
Then six feet of earth makes them both of one size. 
Now, should you ever meet a 
poor fellow that tries 
To battle thi world and its frowns, 
You help hini along, perchanc:3 he succeeds, 
Don't crush and still put him down. 
For a 
cup of cold water in charity given, 
Is remembered with joy in the skies, 
We are all human beings, we've all got to die, 
Api.4.4 Not of earth makes us all of one size.
