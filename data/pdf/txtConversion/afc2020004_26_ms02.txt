Kimberly Blaeser:  Boozhoo. Kim Blaeser indizhinikaaz. Anishinaabekwe indaaw. Gaa-
waabaabinganikaag indoonjibaa. I’m Kimberly Blaeser. I’m Anishinaabe from the White Earth 
Nation.  
[Kimberly Blaeser reads “Poem on Disappearance”] 
 
KB:  In the popular imagination, Native peoples appear primarily after the so-called discovery of 
this continent. In this poem, I wanted to suggest the reality that precedes invasion and 
colonization: the autonomy of Indigenous tribes, their place-making, embedded relationships, 
their lifeways. And I wanted to underscore the consequences of settler colonialism, the losses, 
swathes of disappearances—not just the claiming of land ownership by imperial forces, but the 
results that ensued from a mindset of exploitation—losses of natural spaces, yes, but also the 
disruption of longstanding traditions, losses of resources and species. Finally, I wanted to 
suggest the way the stance of capitalism renders even the bodies of Indigenous women as 
objects of commerce.   
 
This unfortunate transformation of Turtle Island, Indigenous America, I render poetically not 
only through image, but through literal absence as well—through the blank spaces on the page.  
 
Yes, the poem is a lament, but I hope it allows a re-vision of the “idea of Indian,” which then 
may make possible another understanding of place and history.  
 
Miigwech for your attention. Thank you very much.
