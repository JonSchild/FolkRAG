ir. Warden,
 
Thank
, yo" for your recent letter retarding possible Folk Arts Program support
 
for the revival and touring of a serlen of Carolina folt dra ms throughout the
 
western part of the st9te.
 
While the project sounds extremely interestiny, I a
r
ia afraid that the dramas In
 
question m
1pht not qualify as "folk" under the Folk Arts program guidelines.
 
As the enclosed brochure suggests, our definition of folk arts depends nrImarily
 
on the traditionality of the material, t
he informality of its transmission, and
 
the underIlln* cormunity aesthetic supnorttn7 it.  Civen these requirements, I
 
think it somewbAt unlik &7 thst the plays written by students of Professor Koch
 
at Chanel hill in the twenties, thirties and forties woule he regarded by our
 
advisory panel as traditional art forms.
 
Althongb it seems improbable thrst the Folk Arts Provra m could provide x*7
 
direct aasistaucc with this project, I would recos mand that you contact Mr.
 
Coorge Volt, the State Fo1v Arts Coordinator, regarding possible state support.

Dr. Councill Taylor was an excellent panelist, extremely knowledgeable in
 
matters African and African-American and plain old Black.  He is a dancer,
 
a writer, and a savant.  He also has an appreciation of emerginsp
, art forms,
 
knows quite a lot about both :
mzsic and dance and poetry.  I
'd recommend him
 
to you.
 
Worth Long is also an interesting panelist who is rotatin g off Polk Arts' panel
 
this year.  F
ie is a bit per ip atet
ic but  spends
 most
 of  his t
ime in the deep
 
south.  For the next year, he'll be in southeastern Louisiana.  I
'd recommend
 
him to you in the highest terms- he knows Black cultural ornanizations right
 
across the south, is a poet, and a media r
oan.

Folk Arts plans to stay with its travel request of $12

I
'8 like to point out that several trigs which we
 
feel are most important and w
'
,iich we had hope(# to do in the first quarter
 
simply did not happen because of the 52,000 first quarter allocation, as
 
opposed to our request of S4,Q50.  Also, trips which were taken this first
 
quarter were often cut short i
n
. order to stay within t
?-l
e reduced allocation,
 
thereby reducin;* the mumber of site visits in a given city or locality and
 
preventing the stay of additional days which would have allowed for more
 
meetings with people in the folk arts field.
 
Fe would lil,e to request permission to add on the $2,950 difference between
 
the first quarter a
llocation and the amount requested to our third or fourth
 
quarters in order t
o accomplish our original goals.  '
:
Normally travel is liRht
 
in the summer months because of preparations for our Council meeting and a
 
meeting of our Panel on program policy,  however, the policy meeting; in August
 
is being eliminated. freeing up some time for us -- an(? there are many useful
 
trips we can make teen.

Dear Dr.  Schiff:
 
I enjoyed reading your two proposals for the cantor concerts and film.
 Both
 
appear to fit our program guidelines and I am sending along the appropriate
 
application forms.
 Our next deadlines are January 3 and April 1
, with project
 
start dates approximately six months thereafter.
 
In the concert project, I suggest you further highlight the stylistic differences
 
between cantorial traditions.
 An audiotape with musical examples would be of
 
great help in this regard.
 One other issue that we discussed before might
. be
 
further developed,  that of the particular need for the concerts.
 Are the
 
individual culture groups unaware of other cantorial styles?  Could members of
 
a congregation benefit from a more informational or "behind the scenes"
 
presentation of their own cantor's musical tradition?  Finally, I must le*. you
 
know that the amount you plan to request,  $35,400, compares very much on the
 
high side of the range of grants we have given in the past for a concert series.
 
Will the 30% indirect cost rate be negotiated by the application deadline?  If
 
not, overhead costs should be spelled out in individual line items.
 
On the film project,  the same is true of the amount to be requested -- it is
 
higher than any single film grant we have given,  to my best recollection.
 
Coincidentally in both cases,  if you were to eliminate the 30% indirect costs,
 
you would be much more in the range of grants for each type of project.
 
With the film, we will need a good deal  more support material concerning the
 
outline of the film, samples of the filmmakers' work, and resumes of key
 
personnel (
this is true as well for the concerts).
 The advisory panelists will
 
also need to know t
hat there is minimal
. duplication of effort between this film
 
and the one funded earlier this year on cantorial arts.
 
One f
inal and very important detail.
 In both budi;ets you are requesting more
 
t
han 50% of t
he total project costs from us.
 We fund up to (
hut not more than)
 �
 
507 of the t
otal project costs  I
n our organizational grants.

•
 
To make a very long letter short, I am sending you a copy of opr Folk Arts
 
brochure.
 It explains our program guidelines, limitations, grant ranges, and
 
gives some idea, I think, of our program priorities as well.
 In general, we
 
have not supported visiting foreign artists, but have supported foreign artists
 
with U
.S. residency in various ways.
 One example is Yacub Addy Tetteh (
a Ga
 
musician from 
•
 1
 
who, through his /
••.•- Institute
 
for African Culture, has received a couple of grants from us to do series of
 
workshops in Ghanaian music and dance, oriented primarily toward the local
 
African and Afro-American community.
 In other cases, under our apprenticeship
 
category, several advanced learners showing a serious commitment to learning
 
Yacub's music have received apprentice grants to study with him on a one-to-one
 
basis.  Yacub is a Ghanaian citizen, but 
permanent U
.S. resident
 
By the way, thank •  e
 much for
.• them both and enjoyed
 
them very much.  When I first began my studies

Lear Ms. Harmone,
 
I feel very b
ald not to have answe
erea your co m
munication sooner, but I haven't
 
quite known what to sin and thus kept putting mY response off.
 
I knew and a
tdnire Barry Ancelet.  f
ie is a uninuea representr
.
.tive of M R people.
 
l
ie has distinguished himself by his enerpv, his tws!
-ivation, a
 nc
l a kind of
 
duality that I can only describe as purity of intention.  On the other hand,
 
I think Barry is doing just exactly v
fhat he should be doing at this time in
 
his career, heading up the T
_nstitute for Louisiana
n Studies at the T
iniversity
 
of
. '
Southwestern Louisiana.  I
sere he has a structure within which to worl, — 
very important, I believe, for a young scholar -- he is teachinv, writing,
 
running local community soirees and festi
.vala and in general being the role
 
model that he should be for other younger Acadi
.ans.  rrpnkly, I believe that
 
a
rt award "freeing B
atrry"'€rom all obligation and re mitting
, hint to make un-
limited use of his talent'' woulcl come at Just the m
oron,
. time.  7e is only
 
thirty-one: in t
er view, &
e► needs and wrlcotaes obliretions, e9reciailly since he
 
is fortnnateb enough
, to be at exactly the institution v
lvere his pritu
.
 r
y work
 
lies spread out before him.
 
I
'm trying to give you my honest opinion.
 I will say , too , tha t if  I heard
 
mo
 
to
rrow that Barry had gotten a
s MacArthur award I would only cheer.  He is
 
wood.
 I am just not sure this is the bane when he could make hest t
ime of What
 
vour award seeks to provide.
 
I certainly '
Know ,
a few other folks T
'd like to not
 innte myself.
 Is there any
 
provision for this?
 
With s
ay very beat wishes for the success of your work, I a
sr+
 
Very truly.

Dear Hiliie Buekeat
 
or course I remember you.
 I'm delighted that you 're here for a
 
while happy that your husband is able to pursue his archaeo-
logical studies further.
 I am,
 sure you will both learn much that
 
will be useful when you return to Truk and a13o that you will have
 
much to teach your new Santa Sa mara friends.
 
As far as folklore studies go,  I am afraid you won't find much in
 
Santa Barbara itself.
 The University of California at Los Angeles
 
has a folklore program , and you night write Dr. Wayland Nand and
 
as!
,� lin to send you information on any night or Saturday cou rses
 
that
 
i
rght be
 o"fered .  Be sure to use v
jy name;  we are old
 
'
friends.
 If he cannot com
ae up with anything that you could get
 
to,  is the m* some particular topic  that you're interested in?
 I
 
could perhaps send you a readi ng listj  I an sure that the Santa
 
Barbara University library would he s
able to provide you with
 
enough reco mmended books to keep you^ interest.
 
Please let me know if there is anyt hing else  that I could do.
 
You can write me at this address any time.

Subject:  Folk Arts Responses to Touring/Presenting Memo
 
c 
�V
 
1
.
 Folk Arts would like to associate itself with A.B. Spellman's memorandum
 
of October 18, 1982, especially the statement that "there should be no uniform
 
policy on Touring and Presenting save that needed for coordination among the
 
programs".
 
2
.
 Folk Arts'  so-called "ethnic tours" are purposely designed for smaller
 
community.facilities.,  We have therefore confined our funding to the touring
 
rather than the presenting end of the spectrum.  We feel this gets the money to
 
the artists in our field in the most direct manner possible.
 
3
.  We too are engaged in discussions with Regional Organizations.
 Regional
 
Organizations, however, normally send their tours into major auditoria or college
 
campuses,  the end result all too often being as Joe Wilson puts it, "stimulating
 
the overstimulated".  We have been trying to develop community sites for our
 
tours, places where we know community members will go and feel comfortable there.
 
I still believe that we can work through this problem with at least one or two
 
of the Regional Organizations, especially, for example, the Southern Federation.
 
4
.
 Even though Folk Arts carries on minimal touring/presenting activity, we
 
still appreciate being kept in the picture.

Re:
 Cost Center Accounting (
CCA)
 
While the aims of the new cost center accounting method are certainly appropriate,
 
our experience thus far has been that its procedures are confusing, irritating,
 
and time consuming, and I wonder if perhaps we shouldn't take another look at
 
the process to see if
.
. CCA is really going to be helpful to any of us.
 
Case in point:
 the Folk Arts Program has a travel allocation of $2,000 for
 
the f
irst quarter and we had been keeping a pretty accurate log of allocated
 
travel amounts as well as actual reimbursements.  We recently sent to Finance
 
a travel authorization for Daniel Sheehy, Assistant Director, to go to NYC on
 
December 3-5 for several site visits, only to have the TA returned to us saying
 
that we did not have enough money to cover the trip and we would need to f
ill
 
out the necessary form for the transfer of monies from another category and
 
get the Deputy Chairman to sign off on it.  We relooked at our figures and again
 
decided that we had enough money to cover the cost of the trip and resisted
 
filling out yet more paper for the transfer.
 Such transfer would have added,
 
in turn, yet more work for many people including the Deputy Chairman, Budget,
 
Finance, as well as our office, not to mention the time lag in having the document
 
sit in various offices until signoff occurred - all this for less than a $250
 
shortfall even by Finance's incorrect figures.
 
After several conversations with Finance (
I must add that they were not being
 
difficult,  they simply did not have up-to-date information on the computer)* the
 
TA was finally processed without our having to transfer money.
 
But the real question is, why must we -- and they -- go through all of this?  If
 
the intent of the cost center accounting method is to make the programs responsible
 
for their monies,  this system does not seem, at least from this experience and
 
other similar ones,  to be doing so.  Most of the Program Directors have had the
 
responsibility of managing far larger sums than we now have to work with.  We
 
keep good running accounts.
 Surely a slight overage at the end of a quarter is
 
something to keep an experienced eye on, but not something that should take up
 
two days time of two good staffers, not to mention causing them to have to keep
 
a tight grip on their tempers.
 If such a small problem causes this much chaos
 
and irritates this many people, what reserves will we have to call on when the
 
big problems hit us?
 
*This is another sore point all on its own.  Why aren't the figures for actual
 
expenditures put onto the computer in a t
imely fashion?  -
h
ie knew what they were
 
because we keep track here.

Subject.  Nominations for Careers in the Arts publication
 
Folk Arts nominates Sanders (
Sonny) Terry, harmonica blues player.  Mr. Terry
 
received one of the first National Heritage Fellowships awarded by the Folk
 
Arts Program in the summer of 19'1.  His biography as it appeared in the May
 
1982 Council Book reads as follows:
 
The lives of millions have been brightened by the efforts of great artists
 
who themselves are plagued by major afflictions.  In folk music, many of the
 
great musicians have been blind.  Sonny Terry was not born blind but lost his
 
sight in an accident near his home in North Carolina when he was very young.
 
He taught himself to play the harmonica during the lonely hours of his childhood.
 
i
lia father Played harmonica and his mother sang.  As he grew older, be started
 
to play harmonica in local churches and dance halls7 his technique strenphhened
 
and became ever more inventive.
 
Today, Sonny Terry has a national reputation.  Together with his long-time
 
partner, Rrownie McChee, he has toured nationally and internationally.  Ve
 
has recorded several dozen titles on such labels as Savoy, Fantasy, Folkways,
 
Verve and Prestige.  He has been featured at the Newport '
Folk Restival and at
 
coffee houses across the country- he has appeared
. in Broadway shows.
 
In addition to a dazzling technique, Sonny Terry's musicianship is peerless.
 
?
'e alternates singing  and harmonica playing so rapidly that one often does not
 
know which voice is speaking--the instrument or the man.  ?
Fe develops his t
iny
 
non-chromatic instrument into a mini--orchestra, achieving a closely-knit
 
rhythmic structure that imitates the clicking of a railroad train, the galloping
 
of horses hooves after a fox, or that simply urges t
he l
.
i
.stener to come on and
 
dance.  The balletic movements of Sonny's hands, the constant interplay between
 
voice and instrument, the infections beat of his music distinguishes him amongst
 
all American folk musicians.  Re 1
.
s unique, a man not to be replaced.
 
Mr. Sanders became blind as a young boy.  He has supported himself throughout
 
his life by his harmonica playing and sin.q*ng.  F

agent Lou Viola at APA, 838 - 7th Ave., New York, NY  10106, 212-5f

FROM:
 Paula Terry, Coordinate
 
Office for Special Constituencies
 
SUBJECT: REQUEST FOR NOMINATIONS/ARTISTS AND ARTS ADMINISTRATORS TO BE
 
FEATURED IN CAREERS IN THE ARTS PUBLICATION
 
k
v f
t
 
The National Endowment for the Arts' Office for Special Constituencies and the
 
President's Committee on Employment of the Handicapped have undertaken a joint
 
project -- a publication about careers in the arts for disabled people. State
 
Arts Councils and National Arts Service Organizations are invited to nominate
 
disabled persons whose careers in the arts make them appropriate subjects for
 
inclusion in the book. This effort is a result on an interagency agreement
 
between the two federal agencies, and is designed to make the public more
 
aware of the valuable contributions that people with disabilities are making
 
in the arts, and disabled persons more cognizant of the career opportunities in
 
the arts.
 
The President's Committee on Employment of the Handicapped (
PCEH)  is responsible
 
for fostering job opportunities for disabled people and plays a leading role in
 
establishing a favorable climate in industry and labor and related fields towards
 
hiring handicapped persons. The publication will be produced by the nonprofit
 
Public Advertising System of the New York City School of Visual Arts through a
 
contract with the President's Committee. The Public Advertising System has con-
siderable experience in photographing  and interviewing disabled people through
 
its several years of work for the President's Committee.
 
The publication will feature approximately twenty (
20) individuals who are
 
professional artists or arts administrators of the highest caliber.
 The emphasis
 
of the publication will be the individual's career in arts, although the individual
 
must have a disability. The term "handicapped person" is defined in NEA's 504
 
Regulations, Subpart B (
S1151.11) pages 16-18.
 
Employment includes the complete range of the arts -- visual, performing, media,
 
and literary arts  ( i
.e. musuem curator, painter, arts administrator, actress,
 
designer, writer, architect, etc.). All persons selected for inclusion in  the
 
book will be photographed and interviewed  about their work and lives. The '
nook
 
will be nationally distributed by the Endowment and the President's Committee.
 
An Arts Advisory Panel of professionals in the arts will be convened to select
 
N 
the twenty subjects from nominees. Invited to serve on the panel are
 
Itzhak Perlman, Nanette Fabray, Phyllis Wyeth and others of equal stature
 
in the arts world.
 
We encourage you to use your networks to find the highest quality artists
 
and arts professionals. We ask that State Arts Councils notify and solicit
 
local arts councils in the search for qualified candidates. Persons nominated
 
should be currently employed  or self-employed in their chosen careers,
 
and should have regional or national stature. Artists and arts administrators
 
nominated by arts councils will be directly contacted in December by the
 
National Endowment for the Arts. We will request that they submit support
 
materials at that time.
 
Nominations should include:  1
) name, address, and telephone number of the
 
nominee; 2
) a brief biographical sketch of the artist and indication why you
 
consider this person important in his/her field; and 3
) disability of the
 
nominee. Nominations must be submitted to the Office for Special Constituencies,
 
National Endowment f
or the Arts, Washington, D
.C. 20506, by December 1
,  1
982.
 
All completed nominations will be prescreened by a review panel convened
 
from a range of program areas within the National Endowment for the Arts
 
to review the nominations based on artistic quality or excellence in the
 
individual's arts profession. The Arts Advisory Panel will then select the
 
people to be featured in the publication.
 This is not a contest; rather,
 
twenty individuals will be selected from the  best nominees by the Arts
 
Advisory Committee.
 Consideration will be given to representing a range of
 
occupations, disabilities, and geographical locations.
 
We are deli ghted that this cooperative project is now coming to fruition.
 
There had been a delay resulting from the Office of Management and Budget's
 
(
OMB) moratorium on government publications. We are pleased that OMB feels
 
this to be a valuable effort as evidenced by their recent approval. I am
 
attaching a copy of our previous press release for your information.
 
Your assistance in helping identify artists and arts administrators to be
 
considered i
s essential for the project's success. If you have any questions
 
please contact me or Ms. Abby Lazerow, project coordinator, Office for Special
 
Constituencies at the Endowment (

The l
ives of millions have been brightened by t
he efforts of great artists
 
who themselves are plagued by major afflictions.
 I
n folk music, many of the
 
great musicians have been blind.
 Sonny Terry was not born b
lind but l
ost his
 
sight in an accident near his home in North Carolina when he was very young.
 
He t
aught himself to play t
he harmonica during t
he l
onely hours of his
 
childhood.
 His father played harmonica and his mother sang.
 As he grew older,
 
he started to play harmonica in local churches and dance balls; his t
echnique
 
strengthened and became ever more inventive.
 
Today, Sonny Terry has a national reputation.
 Together with his l
ong-time
 
partner, Brownie McGhee, he has toured nationally and internationally.
 He has
 
recorded several dozen titles on such l
abels as Savoy, Fantasy, Folkways, Verve
 
and Prestige.
 He has been featured at the Newport Folk F
estival and at coffee
 
houses across the country; he has appeared i
n Broadway shows.
 
I
n addition to a dazzling technique, Sonny Terry's musicianship i
s
 
peerless.  He alternates si6ging and harmonica playing so rapidly t
hat one
 
often does not know which voice i
s speaking--the i
nstrument or the man.
 Hn
 
develops his tiny non-chromatic instrument i
nto a mini-orchestra, achieving a
 
closely-knit rhythmic structure that imitates the clicking; of a railroad train,
 
t
he galloping of horses hooves after a f
ox, or t
hat simply urges t
he l
istener
 
t
o come on and dance.
 The balletic movements of Sonny's hands, the constant
 
interplay between voice and i
nstrument, t
he i
nfectious beat of his music
 
distinguishes him amongst all American folk musicians.
 H
e i
s unique, a man not
 
to be replaced.

Subject:  Eliminating the revised budget requirement
 
Vot
 
•
.
 
Folk Arts has caucussed on this excellent idea.  Though we approve in principle,
 
we are content with our current procedures because:
 
1
.  We ask our panelists to take one of only three actions:  Approve a grant
 
in full, reject it, or state what parts of the activity they do not wish to
 
fund and give the staff an "up to" amount to work with.  Thus we only need to
 
get revised budgets on a relatively small number of grant applications.
 Since
 
we primarily do projects, when our budget is cut, we just cut the number of
 
grants we fund rather than cut grant amounts.
 
2
.  We schedule our panel meetings to allow us at least eight weeks between
 
panel and Council.  This gives us time to get everything lined up, including
 
explaining to applicants what kind of revisions we are requesting.  We do this
 
by phone, as they tend to be panicked by filling  in extra forms.
 
3
.  We utilize the budget revision calls to explain t
o grantees that they
 
are required to' get our approval for substantive change;,elfher budgetary or
 
content-wise, they wish to pursue during the conduct of the project.
 
4
.  Because of the hard work and dedication of Folk Arts staff, especially
 
Sheehy, Teske, and Rose Morgan, who keep our rambunctious field in fine order,
 
we normally have most of our grants in the grants office by the time of the
 
Council meeting anyhow.
 
After the recent program director's meeting, I understand why some of the
 
Programs would greatly benefit by eliminating the budget review; not us, though.
 
I hope that your announcement of flexibility from program to program still
 
holds.  We believe that for Folk Arts and maybe us along it's a useful step.

 process in order t
o save staff time and t
o reduce the time
 
In fiscal year •
:
 - Endowment awarded $
109.5 million
 
contracts to organizations.  If every grant and contract was one day later
 
than necessary in getting to the arts organization, the total opportunity
 
cost to our 
•
 -
 • 111
 of our 
borrow
 
money from banks and other sources as a "bridge" between Council meetings
 
and actual receipt of the money.  We have an obligation to minimize this
 
period; the benefits to the arts should be substantial.
 
At present, panels usually recommend less than the requested amount to
 
applicants.  Applicants are then notified of the lesser award, and required
 
to resubmit a detailed budget, revised to accomodate the lesser award.  The
 
time required for notification of applicants, revision of the budget (
often
 
requiring many calls to the program and grants offices) and resubmission i
s
 
extensive.  More important, perhaps some of the NEA staff time which goes
 
into the revised budget process could go into ascertaining what actually
 
happened in the project, at the end of the project period.
 I am told that
 
the revised budget cycle is one of the most time-consuming elements of the
 
grants process.  In my opinion it is not time well spent, particularly given
 
our 
-
. staff resources.
 
What I propose is the following:  a team of program office and grants office
 
people get together and work out a process which eliminates the need to go
 
out to the applicant for a revised budget, at least in a large majority of
 
cases.
 (
We might decide to require revised budgets from applicants who will
 
- 2 -
 
be receiving more than some set amount, such as $50,000 or $
100,000.  We
 
might require revised budgets from applicants whose awards are such a small
 
percentage of what they applied for that project integrity i
s obviously
 
threatened, perhaps at 25% of request.  We would obviously require revised
 
budgets from applicants when the panels wish to verify programmatic changes
 
in the projects, such as changes in personnel.)  Something like the following
 
sequence should work:
 
1
.  Applicant asks for $
75,000; panel recommends $45,000.
 
2
.  NEA notifies applicant of the lesser recommendation, saying:
 
a
.
 the 50% match is still a requirement.
 
b
.  NEA will assume no major changes in direction of the project,
 
although some diminution of the project is expected.
 
c
.  NEA will therefore assume a reduction of the overall project
 
budget reflecting the lower amount.
 
d
.  NEA will expect more detailed accounting in the final
 
project report.
 
e
.  Any major changes in the project budget should be reported,
 
either at the beginning of the project or as they occur.
 
f
.  Acceptance of the award indicates acceptance of these
 
conditions.
 
Initial discussions with Bob Wade and'Leon Lilly indicate that a process
 
along these lines will satisfy both legal and accounting requirements for
 
federal grants control.
 
I am very interested in your answers to the following questions:
 
1
.  What are the pros and cons of trying to reduce or eliminate
 
. the revised budget requirement for our applicants?
 
2
.  How would you suggest this be done:  what steps in the process
 
do you see as necessary, and what conditions would you put on
 
it (
upper dollar limit, etc.)?
 
3
.  Who would you suggest for membership on a small team to work
 
out the details?
 
If you can get back to me by the end of Monday, November 1
5, we'll t
ry
 
to have a new process in place as soon as possible.

Dear Mrs . Smith.
 
Thank you for nor
-=inating lAwrence Older for a Natfr+nal T
ieritage rellovship.
 
I was prievod to hear t
his weetk.
 that t
er. Older has died, and I shall therefore
 
have to remove his name from consileration ,
 as these are not awards (
which
 
could be given poethi
jmously) but fellowships f
or l
iving artists.
 
in sWi.tioa t
o your nomination , I have letters f
rom Sandy Paton, Margaret
 
MacArthur .
 Victor F
. Kibler, P€tasr r.
 McFllinott< I also have a copy, of 11
r.
 
Older '
s rolk Legacy recording . Ubuld it be anproDriate for as t
o return
 
theme materials to f
ir. elder 's family, or what could you suggest?
 
This is a d
ifficult letter to write.  I never had the pleasure of �
.
.eetin�-
 
Mr. Older .
 but I haO advired t
r
im by reputations from afar.  7 suppose that
 
the nature of the Heritage Fellowship program i
s such that t
his will happen
 
more often t
han I tike to think . already too marr
y of our nominees have paused
 
on before we had a chance to thank them for their contributions the w
avy we
 
should have.
 
`
I
'hanIs anyway for your support of our program.  Please send a
te other nominations
 
as they a
s
eess worthy to !
tow.

Dear Jennie Lee Gorton:
 
Halcokm Ryder of the visual Arts Program here at the Kdowmont has passed along
 
to us a copy of your recent l
etter concerning your work as an artist and your
 
need for f
inancial assistance.  Unfortunately t
he r
o n Arts Program has no
 
funding mechanism for individual artists fellowships, as you will see from the
 
enclosed brochure describing our program's aims and categories.  .
rust last year,
 
we introduced our n
ew Heritage Awards, but you rust he nominated by someone else
 
in order to be considered for this award and, unfortunately, our deadline for
 
this year (
October 1
1) has j
ust passed.
 
T have taken the liberty of forwarding a copy of your very intereetinp letter
 
to Ira. Lida Rogers, txeacutive Director of the Mississippi Arts Commission.
 
M
ors. Rogers in also a member of the rational Council on the
. Arts, the Endowment's
 
Advisory body, and has always shown a keen Interest in our program and in the
 
f
iele of folk arts.  I should a
cid that i
t is almost always easier
., any; faster,
 
to seek assistance at the local and state levels, than it is at the national
 
level.  Z know that Mrs. Rogers will wive you the bent advice she can, whether
 
it t
akes He form of suggesting you arp Q directly to the state agency, should
 
you so qualify, or Providing su r
iestions or counseling on whom you right contact
 
for assistance.
 
Your interest in preserving the Mississippi deltas plantation scenes throu$ph
 
painting is certainly admirable and we congratulate you on your nany achievements
 
and your great dedication and determinations.
 
With warmest rewards,
 
Sincerely,

Dear reorre,
 
I
've been truing to reach you by phone, but no luck.  I wanted to tell you a
 
couple of thingst  first, that the MissisaippI Arts Council is looking for a
 
state folk arts coordinator, and it occurred to me that you might want to apply
 
(
if you'd like to move to Mississippi, that is).  I think you would he greet
 
for the job, and I have so i
.nforsted Lida Rorers, the extremely snart lady who
 
directs the Mississippi Arts Council.  She is something of a nouthern +
rand
 
dame, experienced in the arts world, an old friend of '
fancy 7anVs, and a member
 
of the ;
rational Council of the ETA.  By all means, if you are interesteet. call
 
her up (
601-334--7336) and t
ell her no, no your name will be p
est in We pot.
 
I don't know how lon^ the position has been advertised, or hog: many others
 
have applied.
 
Secondly, I wanted to tell you that at the AFS meetings in Minneapolis Z ran
 
into Judy Het
.`
.ulloh who was rannlnr the table at which University of Illinois
 
books were sold.  I noticed that gook you aid with the photographs and interviews
 
with six young flacks from Ceorr
:ix e
ra+? she said, "Oh by the way, be sure to tell
 
George when you t
alk with him t
hat that book is ext remely %*11 liked by B
lacks;
 
they keep cominr back to take another look at it, and we've sold quite a few.''
 
So since I couldn't tell you In person, here's the r
e+tssa7e.
 
All the best,  Call if you want any nore Information about the Mississippi job
 
(

uv,
 
Thank you for your thouChtful letter.
 
Although the Polk Arts panel has nearer been really gun?-ho on conferences, the
 
Propsam has funded several that seemed clearly focussed on the public presentation
 
of folk arts and artists rather then scholarly or research oriented concerns
 
alone. 
I think the regional flavor of your proposed conference in a plus; this would
 
allow you to reinforce the occasionally thin ranks of experieanca►d fold lorists/
 
ethromusicologistm/folk artists with additional troops from Texas, New I
fexice.
 
Arkansas and other appropriate states.  The involvement of potential presenters,
 
such as museur. public parks, and libraries people might be useful as yell, and
 
held► keep the conference focussed or the exposure of folk
, arts in addition to
 
the needed research.
 
near in mind
. that Oklahoma's Heritage Fellowship winner, Geors eann Robinson, is
 
a good exemplar of the strength of the combination of public and private research
 
plus presentation t
ckat we try to advocate.
 
I
'll enclose a copy of our current g

write as you need to as this plan develops.  We it certainly trT to heir all we

for applications January 1

MEMORANDUM
 
November 3
, 1982
 
To:  Harold Horowitz
 
Research
 
From:  Bess Lomax Hawes
 
Folk Arts
 
Subject:
 Informatics Package
 
I had t
o be out the end of last week.  In order to try to hold to your deadline,
 
Pat Sanders drew up a response from Folk Arts, making a series of points with
 
which I completely concur.
 I would like to add some thoughts:
 
a
.
 I am not opposed on principle to asking for additional data from
 
applicants.
 I am not, however, at all clear as to what we will do with the
 
information received nor how this ever-declining staff will find time to reflect
 
that data in its day-to-day operations or in its planning.
 Is it now a primary
 
function of this agency to amass information and circulate it?  We've always
 
tried to do that in Folk Arts but strictly in a-spirit of individual helpfulness.
 
We never thought of it as a primary responsibility of the agency itself.  Maybe
 
we should.
 I
'm not arguing here, just discussing.
 
b
.  The questionaire was originally drawn up, as I understand it, to sample
 
the various fields on a voluntary basis.  It has now become universal and compulsory.
 
It seems to me that this change requires a re-examination of the "need to know"
 
factor in every single question.
 
C.
 I believe that the usefulness and integrity of the information collected
 
will be seriously compromised if data from non-arts organizations is lumped in
 
with data from arts organizations.
 Indeed, I really question the propriety of
 
requiring economic information from non-arts-related organizations, such as Indian
 
tribes, educational institutions, etc.
 
d
.  Finally, it makes me rather sad to see the Endowment making the application
 
procedure ever more complex.  We used to be so proud of how we were the least
 
bureaucratic and at the same time the most effective agency in the federal govern-
ment; indeed when I first suggested that it might save disappointment for people
 
applying to Folk Arts i
f they sent us an informal note saying what they wanted to
 
do before filling out the application form, it caused a perfectly tremendous
 
hoorah, the thin head of the Grants Office telling me  that  the
 
NEA was the only federal agency with a one-step application procedure and how he
 
would fight
. to the death to keep me from complicating it.
 (
Folk Arts, with its
 
then 30 grants a year max was obviously the nose of the camel.)  Oh well, sic
 
transit... We're growing up now.  But even though we do have to begin moving into
 
I
 
- 2 -
 
that grave new world when we will talk each to our own computer terminal and
 
hand calculator and seldom if ever to a real live human artist, perhaps we could
 
retain some of that early-years brightness if only in our paperwork.
 Couldn't
 
the new forms be a little more clearly and elegantly designed?  Design Arts
 
could help with that, I should think.  The questionnaire language, couldn't
 
that be a little more interesting, pithy, even evocative?  We have a first-class
 
Literature Program full of good writers...
 
COMMENTS FROM FOLK ARTS PROGRAM ON INFORMATICS PACKAGE  (LETTER OF
 
INTENT,  GRANT APPLICATION FORM, ESA.
 
Letter of Intent
  
Ethnic/folk coding under Music is misleading and should be
 
eliminated.
 (We realize that there is an ethnic/folk coding under
 
dance, but this is more appropriate and probably should stay).
 
Application Form
  
Page 1
  
Under C - Federal Employer Identification Number -  Do we really
 
need this?
 Believe it will cause a lot of confusion among our
 
applicants.
 
Under E - Congressional District of Applicant Organization - We
 
believe this gets us off on the wrong foot right away,  could imply--
or they could infer--'a11 kinds of things,  not the least of which
 
would be that they should have letters of support written to their
 
Congressional representatives, which will then be forwarded to us
 
for response,  etc.
 
Under F - Eliminate names of payee and contact person,  not needed.
 
Have words "print or type"  in parens after authorizing official
 
and project director so applicants will not think that those are
 
signature blocks.
 
Under K - unnecessary/eliminate
 
2A - Project summary - if this is for our use for Council pages and
 
Annual Report,  this space should be left blank for program to fill
 
in correct summary otherwise it will be of absolutely no use as
 
it will almost always be wrong.
 
Page 2
  
Narrative space too long/cut
 
Proposed activities might be better heading...
 
Page 3
  
Under H - What is Marketing?
 If we don't know, we're sure our
 
applicants won't either.
 
f.
<
 
-- Have box to check off if they are a "new" applicant to NEA
 
-- Change NISP so it relates more to Endowment programs on Letter of Intent
 
-- Have box or somewhere show. TPC, AR,  and PYS on front page of application
 
Caveat:
 In these times of having to cut program expenses so dramaticall•
 
the cost of printing our panel books will rise substantially as almost
 
double the amount of pages will need to be printed - more paper and
 
possibly two books, instead of one,  for our panel to read.
 
ESA Form
 
-- was originally thought of as a sampling process and still believe
 
this would be the best approach
 
speaking exclusively from the perspective of Folk Arts,  I do not
 
think that getting complete folk arts data about our organizations"'
 
fiscal activities will be useful to NEA,  the field,  or our
 
applicants because of the extreme variety in nature and size
 
of that fiscal and artistic activity among our applicants.
 
short form seems tolerable, but I would predict that we will spend
 
a great deal of additional staff time explaining the survey and
 
how to fill out the form i.e., exactly what figures we are requesting.
 
This leads me to believe that perhaps the fiscal information that
 
is needed from smaller organizations might be incorporated into
 
the grant application,  rather than requiring a separate form filled
 
out and submitted.
 
also,  I questiorRI
 
' 
whether we should lump together information gleaned
 
from arts organizations with non-arts organizations that just
 
happen to be doing an arts project.
 I  would suggest that requiring
 
additional financial disclosures from non-arts organizations would hav(
 
a negative effect on their being interested in arts activities.
 
Folk Arts urges a reconsideration of the issue of requiring additional
 
fiscal information and recommends a return to the sampling or
 
voluntary approach that was initially planned.

Dear Pnmalyn,
 
This is scandalously late, but I do like to put my appreciation for hospitality
 
received on paper sometime. I occasionally think that when rabriel cslls me I
 
will go down into the e
trave writing just one more note.
 
I thought, as di
al Bob Tasks and the many folk arts coordinators in attendance,
 
that you really s
cent the distance In hosteseing such a warm and friendly party
 
for us In Minneapolis last month.  It was a lovely occasion and set just the
 
right tone for
, our toter conferencewvith the winnespolis Arts Agency folks as
 
wall as my many conversations with the coordinators of the nreat Lakes States.
 
It +
a
rsnaged to six sociability with professional interes t
s in just t
he r
1pht
 
proportion.  Thanks again.
 
M* only complaint was that we didn't have enough time to talk.  Too bad that you
 
couldn't W e at least a part of
. the Folklore Society meeting.  It vas most
 
interesting, as always, When I could vet away frmn the many zany grants conver-
sations that kept s
ee standing in the hall!  Neither Bob nor I
. now anything of our
 
Minnesota Arts Council friends; I huge they wanaged to get in for a while.  I
 
sha h se N theta a bread--and-butter letter today as wall.
 
please let me Inow ubeu you'll next be In '
Washington.  n be we could have lunch
 
or something.

I still f
ind mvself not terribly excited by this idea.  I
r Polk Arts, trends
 
and new ideas are more freouently evidenced in conversations and through actual
 
productions than by the writing
, of evaluative or n
ewsy articles.  I personally
 
find that, although I keep up with the journals relevant to Folk
. Arts, I rarely
 
extract from tbem a tenth of the ideas generated by a good solid visit to the
 
field.
 
A second difficul t* in that the concept of federal funding of folk artists is
 
still such a
9 radical notion that feet peopled ir
, the field do the kind of
 
constructive thinking
; or up-to-the minute reportage that would be good to
 
circulate.  I think we'll have trouble finein€: suitable reporters and they 
will have trouble finding interesting things to report.
 
I
?owever, ve'll viva it a try.

Dear Me.
. 
 Gh :
 
Your letter of October 5 with your plane to study the p'ansori opera tradition of
 
Korea was directed to me for response.
 
I mina I could offer you smse possibility of grant support through our program, but
 
we do not have a cateSory for research projects.  hen the two National Endowments
 
were created in 1965, research was relegated to our sister apenev, the National
 
Endowment for the Rumanities.  Our VolV Arts program does fund sane projects with
 
a humanistic corponent to t
hese, but since we are part of the Arts Fudowment,
 
whose main charge is the Presantation of arts and artists, the main thrust of
 
our projects is just that -- presentation-orionted projects such as festivals,
 
performance tours, art v hibits, and so forth.  Moreover, we are limiter! to
 
artistic traditions found within the confines of the united States and its
 
territories.
 
The only su7gestion I have for you, unless you are a doctoral candidate in which
 
case you could apply for a Fulbri7ht *
rant, would be to look into fundlnp
 
possibilities at t
he lational Endowment for the Humanities.  You n1gbt want t
o
 
write to a colleague and friend of mine there, Dr. Sally Yerkovich, who alght be
 
ahle to direct you to a promising funding source, their Youth grants program,
 
perhaps.  for address is:

your grants search.

Dear Carolyn:
 
It was good to hear from

in St. Croix was cut off in the middle, though I must admit that I was so
 
utterly exhausted at that point that I wasn't sure I was rating any sense at all.
 
I did enjoy my whirlwind stay there, though.
 
I spoke to Walter Murray Chiesa ten minutes ago, and be vas his usual vigorous

self in expressing his interest in visitint St. Croix.  I

I would love to see an application for a c

By the way, would you remind me of your telephone nuv&ers again?  I cannot

Dear Lita,
 
•

I write to support the project proposed by Russell Bernard to extend the
 
procedures developed by the Otomi linguistic project to Chamorro speakers
 
on the island of Rota in the Commonwealth of the Northern Marianas and
 
Ponapeans/Molikese on the island of Ponape, Federated States of Micronesia.
 
Rita Enos, high school principal of Rota, and Damien Sohl, educator and
 
congressman from Ponape, are spending sabbatical study time this year in
 
residence at the Cross Cultural Resource Center in Sacramento California.
 
Their studies are being facilitated by Dr. Steven Arvizu, anthropologist
 
and linguist, who has proposed to Russell Bernard that Ms. Enos and Mr. Sohl
 
spend three to four weeks at the University of Florida learning microcomputer
 
text technology.  In this way, upon their return to Micronesia; they will be
 
able to write directly in their own languages just as those trained by the
 
Otomi program can.  It is this training for which support is being sought.
 
During my visit to Micronesia a year and a half ago, I had the pleasure of
 
visiting Rita Enos and observing her school.  The island of Rota is one of
 
the few remaining where Chamorro is the language of everyday use, and I
 
watched Ms. Enos hand-lettering primers in Chamorro for basic reading
 
instruction.  In Ponape most of the classes I observed were carried on in
 
English before largely uncomprehending groups of students from the smaller out-
islands.  To develop independent control by indigenous personnel over the
 
development of literacy in their own language communities is an achievement
 
well worth supporting, and this particular situation seems to be working
 
out so opportunely.  Dr. Arvizu will spend time this fall teaching oral
 
history and ethnographic techniques while Dr. Bernard will work on the
 
orthographic and technological problems, so that at the end Ms. Enos and
 
Mr. Sohl will be competent to initiate a written literature in their own
 
languages for the first time in history.
 
I think the concept is extremely exciting, and so did several prominent members
 
of the Folk Arts panel which reviewed this concept a few months ago.  However,
 
the project overall was judged to fall outside our guidelines, since its
 
primary focus at this stage was not on any art form per se but on acquiring
 
technological competence.
 It seems possitle that the Folk Arts Program might
 
be interested at a later stage of the project, particularly if the focus
 
shifts to traditional tales, songs, sayings, and the like.

I do hope the Wenner Gren Foundation can support this excellent proiect.

Dear Dr. Cohn,
 
I am sorry to have delayed so long in auveri
_ng your renue±st for an evaluation
 
of Professor Yocum's scholarly work.  I have been out of town a
s fre:at deal
 
these: past months.
 
As a prelininery comment, at they last meeting of the Anerican '
Folklore Society
 
a resolution was passed favoring the consideration in hiring and tenure decisinns
 
of such unusual forms as films, recordings.
  festivals and similar productions
 
along with the more standard literary contributions of folklore scholarship.
 
I s
way perhaps be >
r
eiastake*s as to the exact status of the action, but I believe
 
the President of the Society, Dr. Linda Degh of the Unive rsity of Indiana or
 
the Executive secretary, Charles Camp, State Fol Uorist, '
Maryland
, Arts Council,
 
15 '
Vest
  `
rul
.berry Street, Baltimore, MD  21201, wou13 know and "
tight be able to
 
send a copy of the final wording for your and your colleagues' consideration.
 
Before I came to t
he position at the Folk; Arts Program that I now '
}
told, I
 
taught folklore, ethnological music and allied topicess in several California
 
universities and colleges for some fifteen Years.  My later festival work called
 
on as much knowledge, as much experience, and as much wisdom as any written
 
document or any lecture series.  If writing "maheth an exact man" (
I hope" I
'm
 
not misquoting) , festival *
work m
aabesth a man or voran look
- at the cW
_
_aplexity of
 
oral literature, the depth and dignity of b
emoan covounication.  I think its
 
harder.  It might also interest you to know that professional reetings of
 
folklorists now, both national and state, typically include formal academically
 
analytical reports from folklorists who undertaken to work in t
he context of
 
festivals or other folk events.
 
I first ret Margaret Yocum when I was acting
, as Deputy }
director for Programs
 
for the summer-long Festival of t
inerrican rolklife conducted by the Smithsonian
 
Institution in 1976.  She was a first--class field s
e
e>rk
.er, her scholarship was
 
exemplary, and she maintained a fine relationship with performers and folklorists
 
alike.  I liked her enormously anil indeed offered her a job at the '
 ationasl
 
Endowment for the Arts when I moved there after the festival.  She felt, however,
 
that her s
wain begat lay in t
e3aebing, and I expect she was rlFht.  I a
r
e sure she
 
2
 
r
 
must v ke a .
fine colleague, and I commend her to pour B
rost earnest consideration.
 
"
`lease let me knew if I can he of further assistance.

Dear Charley,
 
I was greatly distressed by your letter of Sentember 23 and regret that several
 
interveeninp out of town trips delayed ry answer until now.  In the interim,
 
however, I was able to discuss the situation briefly by phone With Lynwood
 
Montell, the Chairam of the State of the Profession Co  ittee. and you will
 
notice that I an e
t
eading a copy of this letter to him.  I shall make myself
 
available to the Cmaittese3 at the upcoming meeting in Minneapolis should they
 
wish to call c
an re.
 
In the reantimee, i
t s
eems appropriate that I detail the procedures of t
he
 
National Endow
-,ant for the Arts in general and the folk Arts Program In particular
 
concerning the issues of confidentiality ane conflict of interest. Overall apesncy+
 
policies on the two are quite clearly spelled-out in the Panelists' Handbook, e
t
 
copy of which every panelist receives for his aesneral guidance.  I shall enclose
 
a x
earox of ties relevant pages in t
he Pandbook for 1930181, issued early in 1980
 
and still in use.
 
In terms of the Program's specific procedures for executing these policies, at
 
the beginning~ of every panel
. r
zoeting I customarily remind
  all asses )
led of the
 
necessity of observing confidentiality as to what transpires at the meeting.
 
This instruction is binding on all those attending, including
•
, staff and Fndow
.ment
 
observers.  I further remind everyone of t
he Endowment's concern leAt any conflict
 
of interest sway panel decisions on grant awards.  All present, includi
.np staff
 
m
embers, who feel that they might he considered to pain personally by a particular
 
decision are asked to absent themselves durin¢ t
he discussion of the protect in
 
question.  I have personally listened to the tepee of the meeting of Tune 11, 1991
 
at vhich the Raltinore Muse:ur, of Art's application for an exhibit of window screens
 
was submitted.  I did indeed make r
ry traditional opening remarks, and everyone
 
should have heard them.
 
There were twelve panelists at that
. meeting.  It was also attended by two consultants,
 
one of whoa was a former panelist: the other was you.  At the previous panel meeting
 
in March a vote had been taken to invite to each f
t
jture meetinn A different state-
based folk arts coordinator (
or state folklorist) in order that the panel might
 
benefit from the varying perspectives that would be added to the «
iiscussion.
 
(Consultants, according to overall Endowment regulations, can p
sarticipate in
 
grant award discussions but may not vote.)  In carryinn out this request, Folk
 
Arts staff decided to invite coordinators rou7hly in order of seniority.  As the
 
noat senior of the; currently active !
-rour of state folklorists or folk arts
 
�
i  
coordinators, you were accordi nly f
r
_vitee to the June weetina.  I do not believe
 
at the t
ime of the in
vitation I was aware that we had any r
a
T
iplicationss from t
he
 
state of Y
faryland.
 
As you can see from the forepoins> discussion, I cannot maize available the records
 
of any panel meeting.  ConfidentiAllty in not only the overall regulation of this
 
agency, it was also assured to be ir
_ effect durinp the meeti n, so that I would
 
be breaking the trust of collseapusss as ae11 as s
3gency rules if I pot into a
 
discussion of who said what.  There are Endowment procedures, which c
oo not break
 
confidentiality, for appealing grant award decisions. as far as I know the remedy
 
of appeal has not been sought in this particular instance.  As f
ar an conflict
 
of interest does, the Program obviously relies on the honor of those participating
 
in application review, a quality I would not consider challenging in any colleague
 
or friend
..
 
I have long advocated personally that grant review meeit
anps should be open.  If
 
our June meeetinR had been, I do not believe this ugly situation would have
 
transpired.  I am concerned and dismayed that the fair and just ,
aorkingss of t
he
 
Polk .
Arts ?
grogram have been brought into questions.  I believe we have heretofore
 
generally enjoyed the confidence of the profession, and I a
s
a
± therefore
: extremely
 
anxious to help resolve this situation in any way that Y honorably can.  Please
 
let me know if there is any additional information I might be able to provide.
 
I shall stand ready to meet with the Cormittee at their invitation as well.
 
Sincerely,

Thank you for your letter of September 9
.  It was good to hear of your ensemble,
 
which from the acco manying articles appears to he entertaininf in the extreme.
 
I hope I have an opportunity to witness one of your performances someday.
 
As far as funding from our program to subsidize your touring plans, I re!vret to
 
say that I cannot offer you much assistance.  Under our program guidelines
 
(
determined in no small part by a limited budget), we only surport traditional
 
arts performed by traditional artists.  Consequently, for example, a
re might
 
support a Pinnish--Amerfcan kantele player n
esrforminp the traditional repertory
 
typical of that instrument and cultured tradition, but we would not fund the
 
s
aar
ie musician and instrument to perform old-time blues nor a clearly Aralo-American
 
from Bakersfield, California (
such as myself) who did not learn t
he music and
 
the  instrument from his own cultural tradition.  Thus, the eclectic nature of
 
your repertory and male-up of your group leads ne to feel that your plans would
 
not fall within our program limitations.  I hope this nutshell e
summary adequately
 
explains the situation.  If not, I am also sending Atong a copy of our program
 
brochure for a more complete explanation.
 
I a
ny sorry that I cannot he of help to you or this occasion.  Perhaps I will
 
be able to subsidize you more directly in the future by going to one of vour
 
performances.
 
Sincerely,
 
Daniel Sheehy

Dear "
Ss. Salmi-Saslaw°
 
It was good to receive your response so promptly.  I shall respond in kind.
 
we are swiftly onoour pay to becoming regular correspondents.
 
To gnawer your four questions:  1
) you should apply for an organizational
 
grant, since our apprenticeship granas are to support the one-on-one study
 
of hoar to practice the; art fors, rather than to document it-
, 2
) the organization
 
applying for the grant has control over the rights to sell and distribute the
 
booklet (
they, of course, could turn the control over to you, if they so
 
desired); 3
) the applying organisation has legal s*v concerning whether or not
 
the Department of rducation may print additional
. copies (
if they themselves
 
apply, of course, this should be no problem whatsoever)- and
.
. 4) the NTA does not
 
have a rer.uirement specifying
; the number of free copies to be distributed, this
 
is up to you and the organization applvimg.
 
I have a question of von.
 How will the booklet be distributed?  Also, what
 
information will be included in addition to the step-by--step
 
description of the weaving procese
t, if a
rnr?  Vho will the photographer be?
 
We will need samples of this nersnn's work.
 
I an sanding another copy of our application guidelines, in case you reed
 
them.  The form is rather simple, and it is even simpler in your case, since
 
I do not think that a match of funds and in-kind
. contributions is recuired
 
in applications from Saipan.  Even though t
he form is brief, please do not
 
hesitate to g
ive us a &RIthe added detail necessary on additional pages.
 
Ms. Pawes sends her best regards.  I loot: forward to hearing from you again
 
in the rear future.

Dear Mr. Webb
 
f
ir. Hugh Southern, Deputy Chairman for Programs of the Arts Endowm mt, received
 
your letter of August 31 and forwarded it to our Folk Arts Program for response.
 
Our program, t
?
le program in the
. Arts Endowment Est closely rele
nted to folk
 
music, has supported concerts of traditional music in parks both federal and
 
local, and judgin! from their success, I do spree with you that the parks are
 
a fine vetting for such presentations.  Thev seem especially appropriate for
 
folk music.
 
In terms  of funding from the Fndo we:nt for your plans, though, I cannot
 
paint a very optimistic picture for you.  Our Folk A
rts Program is l
imited
 
to supporting authentically traditional folk artists performing their own
 
traditional repertory.  I personally like the idea of sing--alongs to got
 
people involved in making their own music, but voice majors with classical
 
training betug the swim artists involved, in this case, your idea would not
 
line up withoour prog
rram'es guidelines.
 
I an told that the National Parks Service has a limited '
budget for cultural
 
programs in their parks, but I am also told that that budget is becoming more
 
and r
aores limited all the time.  It might be worth inquiring to them, however.

Subject:  Attached travel request
 
During my approved trip to Santa Fe for t
he YESTAF meeting, Jin Griffiths,
 
State Folk Arts Coordinator for Arizona, invited we to visit him in Tucson
 
over the rest of the weekend, where I could confer with two potential
 
panel members and visit several Folk Arts projects already underway.
 
Since I deterr4ned I could get a cheap--o flight frov Tucson to Washington, DC.
 
t
hat would be less than the ticket I held from Santa Fe to Washington, and
 
s
ince I was offered free room and board with f
riends, I f
elt that the
 
expenditure of an odd $60.00 (
flight from Santa Fe to Tucson) to visit Tucson
 
for a day and a half would be well worth the money.  During the time T was
 
there I conferred with three separate srante+es and attended t
hree separate
 
folk arts events.
 
I
'd appreciate getting; after-the-fact approval for this since Travel g
rants it.
 
Should t
his kind of opportunity arise in the future while on t
he road, i
s
 
t
here some particular  action I should take in terns of getting advanced
 
sanction?  I notified my own staff. but didn't take it any further, since all
 
the action was over the weekend and I
'd be returning to work as per my original
 
schedule.

Dear Bill,
 
I want first to thank you for writing so frankly.  I shall do the same.
 
1
)  I do apologize for not having originally set in place a mechanistr
. for
 
responding to heritage nominations.  We now have a form letter that woes out
 
rromptly, I hope.  There are only 6 of us to do the things we do.
 
2
)  The letter you received about holding nominations over for a second
 
y
,ear was another form letter.  Our single tireless secretary, Pat Makell, and
 
I both checked for double and triple and quadruple nominations of the same
 
person, but apparently in your case, we both goofed.  Roger Abrahams had also
 
nominated Almeda Riddle, so he got the letter about holding her no ination over
 
for a second year rather than you.  I should have written her name into your
 
letter as I did in other similar cases, but I neglected to do so.
 
3
)  As f
ar as bypassing t
he Ozarks i
s c
oncerned, s
hout a
ll I c
an s
ay i
s
 
that Almeda's name was the next in line when the panel voted to close the slate.
 
(
She would have been number 1
6, if they had gone farther.  Clen Okrlin was
 
somewhere in t
he early twenties, if I recall
. correctly.)  Personally, I too felt
 
she should have been included in the final list, and I even drafted a posts-a
-eeting
 
letter to the panel suggesting that Almeda, and a Puerto Rican musician
,, and a
 
Black religious singer whose nave I don't want to include here be added to the
 
final s
late.  Ynwever, I decided after consulting staff that it would be inappro-
priate for r
ye to weigh in so strongly after the fact.  There was already an
 
over-balance of musicians anyway.
 
4)  Concerning Alan Lomax, he nominated only one parson -- Ji my Driftwood --
and the panel did not support the nomination.  The complex personalities and
 
histories involved in the Ozarks were never discussed during the panel meeting
 
as far as I am aware.  71be  panelists, a number of whor
: had never heard of ,
Jimmy,
 
listened to samples of his recordings and appeared to conclude that his work
 
was too %modern" and not sufficiently traditional.  Myself, I vould have gone
 
with Alan is this case rather than with you, Bill.  I do think that Jimmy had a
 
considerable impact on the general public boas with his reworkings of his
, father's
 
and other old tunes, his many tours. and above all his development of the Ozark
 
Center.  I did not speak to this. however, an
d t
he panel obviously agreed neither
 
with me nor with Alan.
 
;
i
 
b
 
- 2 -
 
5
)  Bill Monroe's name coming before the panel for consideration was
 
indeed my responsibility.  I asked Ralph Rinzler to nominate him; Ralph didn't
 
want to because he felt Bill didn't need the honor or the money, but I persuaded
 
him that it would be appropriate.
 Since I came to the Arts Endowment I have been
 
trying to get away from the general Endowment picture of folk artists as unappre-
ciated, shy, overlooked, pitiful, past-their-prime, unsuccessful, isolated,
 
poverty-stricken sad-sacks.  It seemed to me (
thinking in Endowment terms) that
 
one or another of our first Heritage Fellowship, nominees might well be a blues
 
singer or a country musician who had "made it" in the commercial world.  My
 
feeling was that such a nomination might actually enhance the stature of the
 
other less widely known nominees.  There were several such commercially-successful
 
nominations made to the panel; they picked Bill Monroe.  I still don't think it
 
was a bad idea, though several people besides yourself have taken exception to it.
 
6
)
 I really wish I could convey to you and all other folklorists the
 
independent nature of the Folk Arts panel.  They' are independent people and
 
independent scholars; they agonize over their decisions; they work terribly hard.
 
I simply cannot tolerate their being thought of as robots of some kind of
 
Lomax/Rinzler axis.  You might want to glance at the names of the panelists who
 
participated in the first awards (
the decisions were made during a lengthy year
 
and a half during which normal panel rotation occurred.)  I
'll briefly describe
 
those whom you might not know.

In addition we were joined at each meeting by a different state folk arts
 
coordinator; if my memory is correct, Tim Lloyd, George Holt, Nick Spitzer,
 
and Hal Cannon were each present at meetings where the Heritage Awardees were
 
debated.  I really do not understand how any such complex group of individuals
 
could possibly have been controlled by a single individual, especially one who
 
wasn't there.
 
3
 
7
)  Finally, I do agree that we made a mistake
s in allowing panel nominations.
 
It allowed for an appearance of impropriety that was quite unnecessary since any
 
one of them could have simply asked a friend to do the nominating for then.  We
 
will not make t
hat error this year.  In the meantime you right be interested in
 
k
t►owina which panelist nor+inated
  whoa
..  Dan Patterson nominated Hugh McGraw and
 
Sister Mildred Barker.  Elizabeth Dear nominated George Lopez.  Peter Seeger
 
nominated Joe Heaney, Sonny Terry, To my Jarrell (
also nominated by CeCe Conway),
 
Harvey Ward (
also nominated by Jack Braunlein), and Dave Tarras (
also nominated
 
by 4artin Koenig and Ethel Rain).  Jeff Titon nominated Lightning Hopkins ane
 
Reverend C-1. Franklin.  As you can see some of the panel nominees made it and
 
some didn't.  I
'm afraid we got anxious a little too quickly when the early
 
nominations were slow in coming in.
 
If you'll be in Minuegota, I
'd be glad t
o sit down and go over this some more.
 
P
lease feel free to pass this around to anyone interested.

I have a suggestion or two for the Fellows pro "

hink all offices that
 
use interns should be requested not to give t

„studying" a question across t

t
he fellows, who are not here long:
 enough to learn even one operation thoroughly
 
anyway, and bad for the Endow m

Minute or two . I like to help fellows but eroueh i

I also went to express concern for the placing of interns in t

Dear Yrs. Nest,
 
'rank
: you so much for your letter about Jirmy Driftwood.  I Have to tell you
 
with real regret that when I took
: on the position T
, now hold in this federal fundin 'o
 
agency, I decided that I would write no letters or recommendation nor take any
 
other action that s
x
.ight possibly involve the yolk Arts Program in any appearance
 
of a conflict of interest.  Although this may seem an irrelevant consideration in
 
connection with a nomination for a 4edal of Bonor, I really don't believe I should
 
change from a policy that has served this Program pretty well u, to now, I hope.
 
I do have another suv estion, however.  You may or may not have heard that the
 
Folk Arts Program has a National 1
 eritage Award progrs m
z
.  It is described in }
,he
 
brochure Vv enclosing.  You H
aight want to nominate Jimmy for that honor; the
 
first awardees are pictured in the brochure and instructions for nomination are
 
also included.
 
And yes, I do have an office in the Columbia Plaza Building on the 11th floor
 
above that Bureau of nines!  Please do stop in and visit the Program; we'd be
 
delighted to see
e you and any friend of Ji;m+'s is certainly a friend of mine.
 
I as sorry to have missed your recent visit but your letter r
uns held up in the

Dear Mr. Hawes,
 
t
hat a nice business-like letter you write.  I shall try to do the same.
 
My late husband, Baldwin Haves was the second son of Charles Boardman ;
iawes of
 
Boston, Massachusetts who was an editor of Boys Life and wrote a nukbesr of
 
adventure sooriets for boys, one of which won the Newbury Medal for excellence
 
in ehildrens literature.  It was called The Mutineers. Another of his well-known
 
books was the Dark Frigat*.
 
Charles Boardman Hawes died quite young, leaving his wife and two sons,oune aged
 
four and one (my husband) aged two.  Ris wife, Dorothea Cable Hawes (
daughter
 
of the southern writer C
age Washington Cable) remarried a few years later.
 
As a result, r
ay husband know relatively little about his father's family and we
 
have few records.  My son, Nicholas Hawes of 218 Bridge! Btree►t, Northhampton,
 
A
eassachusetts 01060, is the family geneologist and I am sure would be delighted
 
to hear from you.  My understanding is that Charles Boardman was born in Maine and
 
that his branch of the; family essentially based itself in Yaine.  Charles' father,
 
if I am correct, was president of Bowdoin Coll
.e=
_rer, for many years.  Rio sweat-great
 
ancestors cases to the United States, as I understand it, during the 17th century
 
but managed to miss the Yayflowert
 
I should certainly be interested in any references to this or other branches of
 
the Rawe°s family you can refer be
, to.  I was amused to z
et your letter partly
 
because I was born in Texas.  I had to go north to meet a Haves
 
Thank you for your good wishes.  We are working hard to do what we can with a
 
verb few dollars for our fine folk arts and crafts, and particularly t
j-i

and artisans themselves.  I shall enclose a copy of our brochure for your

Dear Professor Saraydar:
 
Thank you for your letter of August A to our Folk Arts Program concerring your
 
plans to build the  .
Iroquois loughouse.  1 apologize for the delay in reenondin¢;
 
this current grant deadline seems to be very popular, and our staff seems to
 
shrink, rather than grow, over time.
 
I must say that I cannot recall a request to our program similar to yours over
 
the last few years; we are not usually involved in funding technical or cultural
 
assistance in the construction of buildings.  I would r
iot let this daunt you,
 
though, from going ahead with your application,  At the same time, I will continue
 
to ask around for other possible sources of funds for your plans; the Humanities
 
Endowment -
nay offer some possibilities.
 
I expect that one of the i
main issues that will come up in the consideration of
 
your application will be the University site.  Oftentimes, universities are not
 
the nost logical places for traditional com w
.nities to congregate.  Elders or
 
people of little for
d education m
ay shy away from the academic setting:.  You
 
should address this issue in your proposal.  How many Iroquois people are there
 
in the area?  Are they in the habit of frequenting the university grounds?
 
As you may see from t
he application form, we give rx
 tchin� grants in which we
 
fund up to 300 of the total project costa.  You list no matchinp contributions
 
in your preliminary budget, but I am certain t
hat some of t
 he missing items could
 
count as in-kind contributions.
 
Another potentially major issue is the 492 indirect cost rate . The $6,890 in
 
indirect costs will undoubtedly seem g
itite high, considering that the application
 
will be in competition mainly with arts institutions that add no indirect cost
 
percentages at all.  You might want to get it lo ured, if possible.
 
On the application form, there is a space for a s
ummary narrative descriptiou
 
of the project $ In addition to this please sent' i
ts an expanded version with
 
all the detail necessary to paint a clear picture of what you want to do, the
 
purpose, future uses of the longhouse, need for the building
: among the Iroquois
 
co munity, and so forth.  Letters of support from corrounity representatives
 
would strengthen your (
application,  Also, it would be important to include
 
resumes of all the principal personnel involves:, and perhaps even photographs
 
of a traditional longhouse.
 
In putting together your application, you ray want to !
,
,,
et in touch with me
 
by telephone.  If you call me person-to-person collect at 202/634-4282 and
 
leave your name and number, I will return your call as soon as I an able.
 
Our official upcoming deadline 3
s October 1
, but if you get the application to
 
us by about October 15, that should be enou7h t
ime to include it in with the
 
rest cowing in for this cycle.

 If you intend to

If you really want to be on the up-and-up about the whole thing, simply send

irst as a student of wine at UCLA ten years
 
ago, and more recently as a consultant on a project documenting traditional
 
Afro-Cuban religious music.  As an aside, I taught the Mexican music class
 
at San Bernardino on two or three occasions about eight years ago.
 
In short, Steve is well-trained and talented in the area of Latin American
 
music moth as an ethnomusicolos+ist and an a performer.  Us first--hand experience
 
with performance greatly enhances his intimacy with the topic and the confidence
 
with which he speaks to the subject.  He is responsible, bard-
-working, s

dedicated to spreading k

I was interested to hear of your research on the traditional r
nisic of the
 
Chesapeak waterman.  It t
rust be rough going, with so few inforrants left to
 
work with.  I have heard of a few others working with maritime musical material
 
that have had a similarly difficult time in collecting.
 
By the way, was "Johanna and Rhodie" presented to you as a Vira
.
,inia sea chantey?
 
I had been told that it was a
s sonp of the Georgia; Sea Island area.
 
In any case, as far as grant support frou,cur program is concerned, I cannot
 
paint a very rosy picture for you.  c
ite general rule of thumb i
s that we fund
 
projects that include the presentation of the traditional art by traditional
 
artists inoone way or another.  So, if you were to apply for money to finance
 
a radio progran, festival, file, and so forth with contenporary traditional
 
artists presenting their own traditional art form, this would probably qualify
 
to apply for funding.  Funds for straight field research without the clear
 
assurance that a presentational product will result are not available,  I
 
regret to any.
 
You might, however, went to contact the state folklorist of Maryland, Charles

Thank you for your letter of August 12 to our Folk Arta Program concerning- the

I have gone over your plans, and though what you want to do I
tight fit our
 
program guidelines in some ways, it does not fit them in other ways, and
 
frankly, I cannot offer you much hope for fundir
.^ throu?f
it our program.  I
 
have a feeling that the context of the performance would be considered by our
 
advisory panelists as atypical of the traditional performance setting.  Also,
 
the exploratory comparison of Asian, European, and Native American attitudes
 
might be considered as more of a husuenistic endeavor, and thus placing the fil:
 
in the domain of the national Endowment for t
he Humanities, our sister agency.
 
In addition, we give matching grants t
o federally non-profit orpanirstions in
 
which we fund up to 502 of the total project costs.  The rest must come from
 
the applicant in the fora of in-kind contributions, grants, and cast
,.  Priority
 
is given to those applications with substantial cash in the matching portion of
 
the budget.
 
go that you might have a fuller idea of our program guidelines and priorities,
 
I am enclosing a cony of our prograr

: like, as veil as

I hope to have them frark±d for display in the office.  Also, the two instruments
 
by Gerardo '
3egron arrived in good condition.  They are beautiful.
 I have one
 
hanging in my office for all to see.
 
Ana "aria Duque sent us photographs of Luis Conzalez at the DAS conference.  I
 
am very pleased that they accented our nomination.  I can tell that he is a fine
 
artist from the three cantos pictured in the photographs.
 
Valter, I am also writing in response to your letter concerning
. Father Alvaro de
 
Boer and the plans to record the Julio Negron family.  We do offer financial
 
support for recordings of folk music, but our support is limited to the most
 
authentically traditional folk
 m usic that is rare or previously undocumented.
 
We are also concerned the music recorded be in a natural
. style, without special
 
arrangements that deviate from the traditional manner of performance, and without
 
special effects added in recording them.
 
Generally, our support goes toward supporting cultural expertise involved, in
 
selecting the reprrtory to be recorded and researching and writing descriptive
 
notes to enhance the value of the recorded music.  We also support artists`
 
fees,grinting of the descriptive notes, and recording expenses (
recording tape,
 
for example).  '
What our advisory panel has tended not to fund is the cost of
 
pressing the actual disc.  Does Father Alvaro have someone knowleds_
,eable in the
 
tradition involved in his plans, or does he possess the knowledge himself?  We
 
are most concerned that the standards of artistic excellence and traditionality
 
of repertory be upheld in the
: recordings we fund.  Are the tir
-bales, listed in
 
the budget, a traditional element in the perfo r
mance of that music, or is it a
 
recent addition?  Would one of the ethnomusicologists in Puerto Rico be interested
 
in participating in the project?
 
As always, it is important to keen in mind that we s
kive matching
; grants (we fund
 
up to 50% of the total project costa) to federally non-profit organizations.
 
They would need to provide at least balf of the costs of the record(s).
 
r
 -2 -
If all of these concerns are t
aken into consideration anc addressed in the
 
project plans, I would encourage Father Alvaro to apply to us for a grant.
 
If he s
loes apply, and I am enclosing, the proper application forms, he will need
 
to send along a sample of the music to be recorded, a description of the cortents
 
of the recordings to be made, a letter of agreement from Julio Negron, resumes
 
for both the project director and the person who will write the descriptive
 
notes, a recording sample showing the technical duality of the recordist(s),
 
and a plan for the distribution of the discs once they are rude.
 
Our next upcoming deadlines are October 1
, 1952 and January 3
, 1983, for projects
 
to begin April 1
, 1983 and July 1
, 1983, respectively.
 
If either you or Father Alvaro have any questions concernin^ the application
 
fora, the additional support materials, or anything
, else, please do not hesitr!te
 
to contact me either by mail or by telephone.  If either of you call me person-
to-person collect and leave your name and number, I will return your call as
 
soon as I can.
 
Walter, how i
s your health?  I hope your back is imp r
oving and not keeping you
 
in San Juan more tha layou would like.  By the way, your letter of nomination for
 
Rafael Cepeda for a '
rational Heritage Fellowship award is still active, and if
 
you have time, I would urge you to gend along a more thorough description of his
 
background and musical involvement, the importance of the bombaa tradition in Puerto
 
Rico, and the apecific ways in which he has encouraged Vae practice of t
he
 
tradition within his own community and made the authentic bombaa music visible
 
among all Puerto Ricans and others.  I think this would be of great help in
 
•honing the advisory panelists how significant and deservin
,p of an award he really
 
is.
 
Well, this is all for now.  I hope things are -oin  well for you.

Dear Sister Callista,
 
Word has reached me about third hand (
so i
t is possibly wrong) that you may
 
have selected the folk_ arts coordinator for Guam.  ?
naturally, we're all very
 
curious as to whom you have selected.  Also, I
'd be personally interestaid in
 
s
welcosting Mr. or Me.
  
 to this rather new profession and
 
seeing if I or other Folk Arts staff_c
 ould be of anv assistance.
 
I try to keep in casual touch by letter or phone with stete coordinator* on
 
the mainland: it will be more difficult in the cane of Guava, but I do believe
 
that a reasonably regular exchanne of correspondence might be helpful on bath
 
ends; also I am sure there are materials -
-- publications, directories, project
 
evaluations, and the like -- that I could send along if I know in what direction
 
your folk arts program was developing.
 
In any case, please be assured of my continued interest in the racif:ic in
 
general and Guam in particular.  On gloomy days here I occasionally daydrear.
 
about the possibility of teaching a sunwer course or two at the University

Dear C

I thought you would be pleased that your nomination of Ceorpeanne Pobinson
 
not only resulted in her getting an award, but her work was used by the
 
Smithsonian Institution as the front and back cover design for their program
 
brochure at this past summer's festival.  Osage ribbonwork is indeed lovely,
 
and it caused much comment at the Museur

 Robinson
 
demonstrated her needlework for a week prior to the awards ceremony.  I
'll
 
enclose also a copy of the Washington Post review of the ceremony; it all went
 
off splendidly.  Please start think
_inp of some other fine American Indian
 
traditional artists whose work should be retosmized.  We'll make at least 15
 
awards every year!
 
Thanks again for your cooperation and help.  I wish I could come to your seminar
 
again, but we're out of money.  '
3ext year maybe.  All t
he hest in the meantime.

This i
s just a personal note to thank you again for your steady, warn and wise
 
support during your Council tenure.  You warn a fine Council member, and t
he
 
Endowment will be the poorer for your l
eaving.  I feel I can make such a cosmic
 
statement, because I represented a field that was easy for the average Council
 
member to overlook, or to sentimentalize over, or to misconstrue.  You did none
 
of those; you kept your eye on the fundavental problems and treated us with the
 
awe careful respectful attention you showed t
o all the other fields.
 
I really appreciated your cautionary wisdor
t and your consistent helpfulness.
 
Outside of t
he fact that we bacame -
-- I hope and believe -
- personal friends, I
'll
 
miss you in that other professional dissension as well.  Please let's keep in

rts
 
The Wall Street Journal lady telephoned me and asked when we could talk
 
substantively about Endowment affairs, specifically questions concerning the
 
budget, my impressions of the Chairman, and how the agency as a whole was
 
getting along.  I said I was just back from a lengthy series of out of town
 
site visits and was not up-to-date on budgetary considerations, and that,
 
though I did not wish to seem evasive or uncooperative, I was extremely busy
 
with the new Heritage Fellowship program and would appreciate her deferring
 
our conversation for a week or so.  I also recommended that she get in touch
 
with the Public Information office and I think, though I
'm not absolutely
 
positive, that she said she either already had or that she would.
 
I think a memo from you giving a written outline as to how we are to handle
 
requests from media people and reporters would be helpful.  There are lots of
 
new staff and even us old tired ones get doubtful sometimes.  For example,
 
I just gave WETA a tape recorded interview on the Heritage Fellowships, and
 
I know I will be asked on the mall for more.  Should I tell you before or
 
after or both?  I also attach a copy of  a VOA program that I was interviewed
 
for.  My general rule of thumb has been that I would take care of (
while
 
letting your office know) substantive enquiries about Folk Arts per se, as
 
long as they weren't fiscally speculative, while referring general Endowment
 
queries upstairs.

Dear A
ir. 'A
l
 idden,
 
'hank you for your recent letter regarding possible rolk Arts Progract support
 
for your work in the area of seashell sculpture.
 
While the slides which you enclosed with your correspondence are certainly very
 
Interesting, I am afraid that they confirm the fact that your highly innovative
 
work falls outside the guidelines of the Folk
. Arts Program.  If you will examine the
 
attached copy of our Program Description, I think you will find that Polk Arts i
s
 
permitted to support only those traditional art forces supported by shared, co-Munity
 
aesthetics which have been t
ransmitted informally over time.  In addition, the only
 
categories of individual support available t
hrough Folk Arts are apprenticeships
 
and National Heritage Fellowships, neither of which sees especially A
;Ipropri
.ate.
 
As an alternative to Folk Arts rrovram support, I believe you have contacted the
 
appropriate source in the F
'ndow*
.
:
.ent `
s Visual Arts Program.  I am sure you will be
 
hearing from their office in the near future regarding Your application for a
 
fellowship in sculpture.
 
I am sorry we are unable to he of assistance to you in pursuing your work, and I
 
wish you the beat in identifying
, other sources of funding.  I an enclosing the
 
support materials which you provided the Folk Arts Program should you need them
 
in making application to other agencies.
 
Again, thank you for your interest in the Folk Arts Program.

t very much your warm steady support  an d regar

meant to me during t

even possible, I didn't knmy if the artists were out there for sure anymore, and
 
I didn't bnow i

8 we were smart enough to develop ways t
o find teem and fund t
hem
 
besides.  As you, I suspect, alone among all the Council knew, we fell on our
 
faces quite a lot of tires, in te ms of what we wanted to do and hoped to do.
 
But it got better, and we s
h
ot better at our i

I find the enclosed sort of discouraging.  I had a long meeting with Shalom in

tetting his salary
 
basically from F01Y

our guidelines.  And every onee in a while learning
. to say "folk art" instead
 
of "folklife" wouldn't hurt.  But this seems to me totally pointed towards the
 
profession and almost
  not at all towards artists or .
folks, as far as that goes.
 
Maybe I
'm just gloony these days.  I have viral bronchitialpneu"Onia that just

ThAnk you for your letter inviting me to visit your Center.
 I s
lid
 
not respond right away, because my travel glans were still up in the
 
air.  As it turned out, on my trip to the test, I regrettably did
 
not have the time to make a swing through northern California.  The
 
furthest north I got was to Fresno, and then I had to rush '
back to
 
Los Angeles for more apnointynenta.
 
For the future, though, I definitely plan to s
nake a full-fledged visit
 
to our :
%any grantees and other friends in the Sacs Francisco area. and
 
you will definitely be on s
ay itinerary.
 I will get in touch with you
 
as soon as I have an idea of when that will be.
 
Best regards,

Dear Mr. Dunann:
 
I apologise for the delay in returning your slides.  Your application
 
for the U.S. Japan fellowship was recommended at the level of the Folic
 
Arts Frogram, but apparently, later on in the review process it was
 
cut from the finalists.  After it was recommended by our panel, I felt
 
it best to hold on to the slides a hit longer in the case that they
 
would be needed in further application evaluation.  I should have
 
contacted you t
o inform you of this, but it was a detail that slipped
 
by me.  I regret any inconvenience it might have caused you.
 
Your slides were returned to you yesterday under separate cover.  If
 
they have not already reached you, they should :
arrive at any time.
 
Beat regards,

nomination and would greatly appreciate your providing us with any additional
 
background materials that may be indicated on the enclosed checklist.  We
 
apologize for resorting* to a foray letter for this purpose, but we are rapidly

sent back to you.

Subject:  Folk Arts policy meeting
 
U 
Folk Arts' next panel meeting is a two-day affair planned for August 26 and
 
27.  The first day will be spent essentially in grant review.  Friday,
 
August 27 will be reserved for a full scale policy discussion along the lines
 
of the outline that I have attached for your information.  The panel has
 
also received Council book pages covering all the grants they recounnended
 
during fiscal 1982.  At the meeting, they will receive some additional up-to-
the-minute budget information for fiscal 83 and 84 and a statistical analysis
 
of the Folk Arts 1982 grants, currently being prepared.
 I shall forward you
 
copies as soon as they're done.
 
It occurred to me that one or another of you might want to attend the Friday
 
policy discussion either in whole or in part.  If you can let me know which
 
topics are of greatest concern, I can try to let you know approximately when
 
that particular discussion might take place, or simply jimmy the agenda about
 
so that it fits your schedule.
 
You are of course cordially invited to sit in on the grants considerations as
 
well (
all day Thursday, August 26).
 Sometimes I think grant debates are more
 
fundamentally informative than policy discussions.

Way back in 1973, the Folk
. Arts panel rejected an application from the
 
Appalachia South Folklife Center (
of Pipestem, West Virginia), and ever since
 
that black day, they've had it in for us.  About every six wonths, ASFC
 
director Don West, who must be eighty if he's a day, triumphartly sends me
 
another notice of an activity which we have not funded and then t
its back
 
and snickers, the ornery old so-and-so.
 - _
 
Actually, this is
 classic mountain spit-in-your-eve revenge, and I thought
 
you might find it a reassuring example of the fact that we've not buried
 
t
he last pioneer yet.  Besides, considering; how difficult it is for us to
 
get  proper credit for things we do do, maybe :
netting publicity for things
 
we don't do is a feasible alternative!

Dear `
fancy,
 
Thanks so uwch for Your nice note.  I too was delighted with the selection of
 
Georgeann Robinson.  She :
na
.de a fine speech at the award ceremony in which
 
she said that t%e Osajes owed their ribbonwork specialization to the 18th
 
century French revolutionaries who stripped the aristocrats of their lace
 
and ribbons thus making them available for trade goods to French exploreets2
 
And then, as she pointed out, the 0sape ladies the explorers ran into knew
 
3ubt what to do with all that pretty stuff.  Great folk history.
 
Please bear in mind that we will need some more 4quivelently interesting and
 
useful nominations for next year's omrds.  Due date for letters of nomination
 
is October 1
, in case you get any ideas or run into anyone who would like to
 
nor+inate someone.
 
Finally, we have two sore panel meetings this year.  August 25-27 and December
 
5-6-7.  Please let anybody here know if you can cone to either or both: we'll
 
fix up the tickets and all that with great pleasure.  z
'
.ave fun with the
 
Winnebagos, and congratulations :
for getting that history actually done.  It

July 21, 1983
 
To:  Hugh Southern
 
Deputy Chairman for Programs
 
From:  Bess Lomax Hawes
 
Director, Folk Arts Program
 
Subject:  Revised Application Forms
 
I have several general comments on the proposed revisions:
 
1
)  I associate myself with A
.B.'s earlier comments on the inappropriateness
 
of using grant application forms to collect general informational data for our
 
own purposes.  The Arts Endowment has long been distinguished for i
ts comparatively
 
simple and direct application procedures.  I continue to feel proud of the fact
 
that through us any citizen can petition his government without having to hire
 
an accountant or a professional
. grants writer in order to have any chance at all
 
of success.  I further wonder whether this is an appropriate time to propose a
 
more complex series of paperwor'c hoops for applicants to jump through.  I had
 
understood that there was a general movement to simplify rather than to complicate
 
citizen—federal interactions.
 
2
)  The application form, i
t seems to me, should be limited to information
 
that will help panelists make sensible decisions concerning grants.  This may
 
vary from field to field.  For example, Folk Arts often asks applicants to
 
provide information as to just what part of a project federal funds are requested
 
for.  This i
s important information for our panel, but might be not at all relevant
 
to the considerations of another program.  These particular supplementary requests
 
will, I predict, inevital
;,ly creep hack
. in program by program no matter how the
 
form i
s finally revised.
 
3
)
 Folk Arts rather li;;es the current form.  This i
s partly because
 
familiarity in this case breeds comfort, but it's partly because i
t's not so
 
awful after all.  We have frequently suggested a feia revisions on the form
 
i
tself; I don't know whether you want any sucl, simple an approach at this time.
 
4
) would i
t not he possible to direct the energies of t
he form revisionists
 
towards the final reports?  The fiscal final report form provides no information
 
whatever, and this i
s when you would really like to know just what they actually
 
wound up spending that money for, and how they really did get their match together,
 
all of which information a grantee should he perfectly willing to share.  And if
 
they weren't, I wouldn't feel at all ?
gad about leaning on them heavily.  This is
 
- 2 -
 
when our statistical needs might be fulfilled at least in part and I think the
 
figures we would end up with would !
Ne  far more accurate than those taken from
 
V,e application form.
 
I have attached Bill Potter's revision with pencilled comments.  I hope we do
 
not seer
. too negative.

In your final report, you should present as clearly as possible just what you
 
have learned during your apprenticeship, and perhaps even mention *h
.
 at more
 
you could learn during another one.  Do not spare the details, especially
 
those that give hard-hitting iusiRhts to your apprenticeship experience in
 
the wartachi milieu.  Also keep in mind that it is they t
raditional end of the
 
mariachi musical spectrum that is of most interest to our program.  You might
 
mention the groups and situations that you have performed and studied in as
 
well.
 
Things around here are about the same.  The group continues to hold together,
 
but business is terrible.  People just don't seem to have the loose money to
 
spend on music.  I don't mind it that much, though- I can always use a break.

I am sending along an application form, in case you do not have one.  The next
 
deadline is October 1

expires, you should send us a letter requesting that the current grant period

Dear Mr. Angus:
 
Thank you for your letter of July 6 to our Folk Arts Program concerning
 
possible f
ending for the "
rational Highland Dancin^
- Championship.
 
In past, the policy of our prograzr, and, I believe, that of the Arts
 
Endowment at large, has been not to support arts competitions of any sort.
 
Riddle contests, for example, are not fundable under our program guidelines.
 
In addition, in your case, sane of the s
pecific #texas you request funds for--
travel for the judges and dormitory counselors, construction of s
tance platforms,
 
and general subsidization for housin^ and heals -- would not be the expenses
 
given high priority for funding by our advi
.sory panel.  Two of their highest
 
priority items are artists' fees and the involvement of cultural expertise
 
in the planning and carrying out of the artistic presentation.
 
I wish I could present a more optimistic picture for you, but given our present
 
program guidelines and priorities, I cannot.  You may want to look into funding
 
possibilities through your state arts council in Columbus.  Their address is:

Mr. Terry Zwigoff

Dear Mr. Zwigoff:
 
Your proposal to produce a film on the life and music of ?
toward Armstrong seems
 
interesting
, and it may fit our program guidelines.  From the Information in
 
your letter, the film personnel seems to be thoroughly professional and Mr.
 
Armstrong appears to have been little documented; both are important criteria
 
taken into consideration by our Folk Arts advisory panel during application
 
review.
 
Another important area of concern will be the traditionality of the filers
 
content and the cultural expertise coming to bear on the subject in the
 
production of t
he film.  Mr. Armstrong's repertory is obviously wide-ranging,
 
and my feeling is that in soT:e respects, he and his music would be considered
 
to he of a traditional nature, and in orther respects, his music mould be
 
thought of as an eclectic repertory necessary to a successful professional
.
 
musician.  This may seem like splitting hairs, but i
t will undoubtedly figure
 
highly in whether or not the application would be more appropriate for our
 
program or for the Media Arts Program here in the Arts Endowment.  Involving
 
a cultural consultant (
such as a folklorist or ethnomusicologist) may be of
 
,
great Help to you in putting into relief the representative value of Howard
 
Armstrong (
traditional Afro-American folk artist vs. professional musician)
 
and in general, in coming up with the most sensitive treatment possible of
 
what in many ways is a very complex topic.
 
I have enclosed application forms from our program and from the Media Arts
 
Program for your convenience.  Our next application deadline is October 1
, for
 
projects beginning April
. 1
, 1983 at the earliest.  Along with your application
 
to us, you should include resumes for the film personnel, including the cultural
 
consultant, seat iwdication of Mr. Armstrong's agreement to participate in the
 
film, as detailed a plar
. as possible for the distribution of the finished
 
product, a
 sequential outline of the f
ilm's contents, and a sample (
ten-m1nutes
 
or so) illustrating the filmmaking ability of those involved.  The film sample
 
should approximate the style of treatment to be used in the proposed film,  Also,
 
a sample of :
toward Armstrong's recent performing (
an audiotape and photographs,
 
at least) would be important to include.
 
Finally, for the moment, anyway, I would strongly encourage you to include
 
same cash resources (
usually either cash or grants) in the matching portion
 
of the application.  As our own budget decreases, our advisory panel has been
 
increasingly reluctant to be the only cash contributor to film projects.

Re:  A Preliminary Flan for an `EA Information Center
 
Overall, Polk Arts staff looked at this proposal with real reserve.  iobody
 
actually opposed it, but comments were restricted to "yell", and "
:lone".
 
I think this is because the idea is so obviously com mendable that one
 
hesitates t
o point out the possibility that unless we are extremely careful
.,
 
we my find ourselves thought of as a primary source for information on the
 
arts, a role we have neither time, facilities, nor staff to undertake.
 
After some yearns, Palk Arts has gotten across to the general public that if
 
you want information on folk arts the first step is to .
ao to a public library,
 
not to write a letter to the Mational Endowment for the Arts.  When I first
 
came, I not m letter requesting information from at least one high school
 
class a week.
 
This dismal croaking should not be interpreted as "Don't do it" -
- it seems
 
a basically good idea.  Maybe, though, we shouldn't blow our horn about how
 
much arts information we have until we've worked up a wav of distributing it
 
or allowing public access to it.

I am enclosing a copy of a review that appeared in the Washington Post the
 
day after the National Fellowships were finally awarded.  The story is quite
 
accurate and captures well the ambiance of the occasion which was serious,
 
warm, and occasionally just a bit sentimental (
but then, why not?).
 The
 
Chairman and I gave out the framed certificates in a brief ceremony before the
 
actual concert began; Theo emceed the rest of the evening with his always
 
expected and always welcomed eloquence; the Departmental Auditorium to which
 
we had retired because of the threat of rain was packed to the rafters; the
 
honorees all demonstrated, by the elegance and individuality of their perfor-
mances and comments, just why they had been selected; and all in all, it was
 
a real success, I believe.
 
So now I want to thank you personally for all your support and good counsel
 
while this whole effort was coming into being.
 I do wish you could have been
 
with us, but perhaps at a future Council meeting, some of our honorees can
 
join us and you can get a first-hand sense of the dignity and skill of these
 
remarkable artists.  They, by the way, wish me to express also their profound
 
sense of gratitude to all those who contributed to this program; and that
 
plainly includes every member of the National Council on the Arts.

Dear Sis and Gordon,
 
I
'm sending along a copy of the little brochure
s we put out that describes what
 
we do in the Folk Arts Program.  I guess I want you to feel like we do
 
something, even though we don't -- and can't -- do what you are asking
, funds
 
for.
 
The thing
, is, Congress set up the two Endowments ane
. specifically stated that
 
the National Endowment for the Humanities is to take care of scholarly research,
 
while the ;
rational Endowment for the Arts is to tare care of the production of
 
art itself (
creative writing, poetry, misic, drama, etc.).  So I
'm constantly
 
in the uncorafortable position of telling
, p
eople if you want to write
s a book
 
about an art form, you have to Qo to TMM, and NEM is an awfully difficult place
 
to get m
. ney out of unless you are attached to a
c scholarly institution.
 
You might consult Alan about the situation.  le's managed to wangle some grants
 
out of NEE through his connection with
. Columbia.  q
ty own hunch, though, is that
 
neither NEA nor RM  can help you.  Let me give you another thought.  Why not
 
write the Skaggs Foundation at 1330 Broadway, Suite 1738, Oakland, CA  94612.
 
You could use e
r
n
+ nave if you wanted.  They are a private foundation that likes
 
to fund folk type things, and t
his idea just might appeal to them.
 
I don't aver se es to get up to :
yew York these days.  In fact, I don't ever get
 
out of Washington in any direction as much as I would like to.  !
one of these
 
days, he' ll have a reunion.  In the -
-eantime, here's a little article I s
lid about
 
one of our latest projects that I hone will make you feel eood.
 
Affectionately always,

Dear karjorie,
 
This is .
just a note to express cr
y appreciation ane admiration for the fine job
 
you did as Heritage Program Coordinator at the
. Smithsonian's Festival of
 
American Folklife 1982.  Program coordination Is a task fraught with responal-
bility, requiring a delicate touch, great patience, and considerable t
act.
 
You certainly showed all three
s.  I e
ras+ also very impressed by your ability to
 
leer your priorities straight; i
t was very clear that the needs of the part y
 
cipants were always first in your mind, and it's easy to lose that essential
 
perspective.
 
Finally, you worted really hard and weren't afraid to put out the extra effort
 
that was needed in a particular situation, whether or not it was "your Job".
 
Festival program
s coordination is admittedly a specialized assignment, but it
 
seems to rm that you d
emonstrated skill, intelligence, backgvound, ane diligence
 
in high degree and I
'd certainly enjoy wart
-
.ing with you again.
 
Please let me know i
f
. I can be of help now or at some future t
ime, and let's
 
keep in touch.
 
Sincerely,

Dear Mtss Kinikini,
 
I write to tell you how very much I enjoyed the performance you and your
 
family put on a few weeks ago at the Fife Conference in Logan.  I was in
 
the audience, and many others besides myself were pleased, moved, and
 
fascinated by the performance.  The drumming was particularly fine, the
 
singing as well, and the dances were of the highest interest.  In fact,
 
I would think of anything I would like to see changed in the entire program.
 
Mtse Kinikini, I hope that you will continue to work, together with your
 
talented family, to preserve the original culture and arts of Tonga.  I
 
visited Hawaii a year ago and tourer the Polynesian Culture Center and was
 
disturbed by what seemed to me a
s sort of show-business approach to the
 
Pacific cultures, just the exact opposite of what you and your family presented
 
to us in Logan.  I myself work for a program that is concerned with helping
 
to preserve the living art forms of the many peoples that live here in the
 
United States, and I feel a very deep responsibillty to testify publicly when
 
I see these important cultures being nresented well or badly.  I ho'e you
 
will oo on presenting programs of the puelity and interest and realness that
 
you gave us in Logan, and if there it;  ever any way I can be of
. help, I hope
 
you will let me knows.
 
I would also appreciate it if you would give m9  respects to your father-in-law,
 
!
f
ir. Muli Kinikini, and tell hiss how much I appreciated his performance and
 
his gifts as a composer and a musician.  He has taught and inspired his
 
family well.
 
I shall enclose a
s little brochure that describes the work that the Polk Arts
 
Program does in Washington.  Val Cannon wor2,s with us often and could help
 
answer any questions, and perhaps we can be of assistance at some time in
 
the future when you have a Tonean cultural project that needs some backing.
 
Yours very sincerely,

Dear Sarah Richards,

I am happy to hear that you will soon begin recruiting for the position of Folk Arts
 
Coordinator using grant monies made available through the Folk Arts Program.  I
 
am also happy that you are planning to treat the position as a fully professional
 
slot, recruiting in the general neighborhood of an Assistant Program Specialist 4
 
slot with a salary in the $
17,000 range.
 I have checked through the last several
 
such positions that Folk Arts has funded to find that the salary you are considering
 
falls within the medium or slightly low range compared with those of other equivalent
 
statearts agency positions.  You will need to offer at least $17,000 to make your
 
position competitive with others and to attract the kind of qualified professional
 
applicants needed to do the work detailed in your position description.
 
As a person who has watched these positions in the various states over the years
 
from t
he vantage point of a funding agency, I can assure you that if you do not
 
attract a professional, the position simply will not work out.  You need applicants
 
with demonstrated professional skills in this field, including appropriate educational
 
background at least at a master's level, in ethnomusicology, folklore, cultural
 
anthropology, American and/or Pacific studies, and professional experience in
 
the planning and management of folk arts programs as well.  Quite a number of the
 
other State Folk Arts Coordinators -- now numbering nearly thirty -- have their
 
doctorates; every one of them has told me that the demands of their jobs are so
 
complex that they use every ounce of their previous experience, education, and
 
training every day.  These are truly top-flight positions, and require top-flight
 
people to fill them adequately.
 
I
t has long been my personal dream to be able to help the state of Hawaii to
 
develop a program in the traditional and indigenous arts that will make ever
 
more healthy, and ever more visible your remarkable multi-cultural heritage.
 
I believe very deeply in the potential that a well-trained highly educated
 
folk arts specialist and advocate can bring to your agency.
 I
'm delighted
 
t
hat you are so near t
o finding one.  Please keep me informed, and if I can
 
be of help in any way, please don't hesitate to get in touch.
 
Cordially,

Dear rx. Detoux,
 
Thank you for your letter of
. June 2
5.  I have set the process underway to +
give
 
you a time extension for the baleen basketry project until r
'ebruary, 1
.983.
 
Powever, if you will examine your arrant letter, you will discover that it
 
specifically states that the Bras:t was awarded to fund an exhibit on baleen
 
basketry.  Thus, if you eliminate the exhibit, you will have changed the
 
entire scope of the project, which must then be rere
_viewed by the Folk Arts
 
,
Advisory penal before the ohliaated funds can be released.  Please note also
 
that in t
he case of budr
.
,et revisions, if you s
wish to movermoney from one
 
category to another, a revised budget mast be submitted to and approved by
 
this office as well as our Grants Office.  This applies even when the end
 
f
igure reamins the sarig.
 
Perhaps we should discuss all this bq phone at some
! point.  I understand your
 
need to reassign the personnel but the eliminating t
he exhibit seems to cut
 
the central heart out of the whole effort.  What then would the publication
 
be about?  '
that would he taught in the workshops?
 
It is a shade that you have been plagued by so many delays.  I had understood
 
that all the endangered species questions had been cleared before the application
 
even reached us here.  I do !
pope that somethinpccasf be worked out: let's
 
talk it over soon.  You can call s
ae person-to-person collect at 202-634-4282
 
and I will return your call on they federal
. line.  Or if you prefer, you could
 
;
discuss the ratter with Bob Teske or Dan Sheehy as well.

P.S.  Have you discussed your difficulties with Suzi Josses?  She might have a
 
suggestion or two, and she knows the folk Arts oreration vwry well.
