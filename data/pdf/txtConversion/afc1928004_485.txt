Entered, according to Act of Congress, in the year 1879, by A. J. Ffsiarm, 
in th.., Office of the Librarian of Congress, at Washington. 
Written by JAS. R ICHMOND for PAT ROONEY. 
Copyrighted by A. J. FISHER, 2879. 
You've heard of McCormick, the politician, 
But I 
am the man that's wide awake; 
I 
can speak as long as O'Leary can walk, 
And for grammar I 
take the cake, 
I 
was seventeen years a 
Congressman, 
And in the Treasury I 
made a 
big dent; 
I'll have no trade dollars, but all iron money, 
When Muldoon is your President. 
CHORUS. 
I'll give every bootblack a 
broNs n 
stone front, 
And the laboring man free rent ; 
I'll make politicians walk on their hands to save their shoes 
When Muldoon is your President. 
I'll have iron railings around New York, 
I'll build a 
railroad across the sea ; 
I'll move Central Park to Washington, 
You can ride to California free. 
I'll tear down all the Elevated roads; 
No more Governors will be my intent ; 
I'll have steamboats running by telegraph 
When Muldoon is your President. 
Moloney You're Led Astray. 
Written by JOHN F ADAMS, and sung by PAT ROONEY. 
Copyrighted by A. J. FISHER. 1879: 
My name is Mike Moloney. 
In the Fourth Ward I 
dwell, 
I 
just came here to-night 
My story for to tell. 
It's about a 
gang of roughs, 
I 
see them every day, 
When I 
go out sure they all shout, 
"I'm told you're led astray." 
CHORUS. 
They say go back to Ireland. 
And there forever stay, 
If you want to lead an honorable life, 
And not be lead astray. 
I 
got an invitation 
To attend a 
ball the other day, 
It was given by Mrs. McNally, 
Who resides across the way. 
As I 
ascended up the stairs, 
I 
heard some one say, 
" 
Here comes Moloney, let's put him back,' 
Or he'll be led astray." 
They say go back, &c. 
I 
determined to go to that ball, 
Let the boys do what they may 
So I 
went up on the landing, 
And for a 
moment there did stay. 
When they knocked me down with pillows. 
And thete they let me lay, 
MOLONEY YOU'RE. LED ASTRAY. 
Continued. 
As they walked out I 
heard them shout, 
"Moloney, you've been led astray.' 
They say go back, &c. 
I 
picked myself up and followed them, 
Just as quick as ever I 
could, 
But when I 
got out sure they were gone, 
So it didn't do me any good. 
I 
went to Mrs. McNally's room, 
When to me she this did say, 
"We have no ball, so I 
must confess 
That you've been led astra.3 .
!' 
CHORUS. 
Says I 
I'll go back to Ireland, 
And there forever I 
stay, 
For if I 
stop in America, 
I 
surely will be led astray, 
Encore. 
My Henry is a 
preacher 
In a 
great big Brooklyn church, 
With twenty thousand dollars every year. 
He plays possum with the ladies, 
And leaves them in the lurch, 
And the congregation all feel very queer. 
CHORUS. 
He's a 
lady killer, he's a 
hypocrite, 
He is like a 
Turk in war without a 
spear ; 
He has had more fun than any son of a 
gun, 
And can kick as high as any Texas steer 
Cats in Our Back Yard. 
Writtm by JAMES RICHMOND for PAT ROONEY. 
Copyrighted by A. J. FISHER, 18 79. 
I 
live in a 
brown stone tenement, 
With green shutters painted white ; 
There's a 
family of cats lives in the rear, 
They play " Pinafore" every night. 
They sing something about Maria, 
And the times are very hard ; 
Oh, they'll chew tobacco and spit in your eye, 
The cats in our back yard. 
CHoRUS. 
Tral a 
le, tral a 
la, 
For the cats in our back yard. 
(Repeat.) 
They have walking matches on the fence, 
Have picnics in the cellar ; 
I 
threw seventy bricks at a 
Thomas, 
You ought to hear them beller. 
They sing alto, base, and tenor, 
Oh, they ought to be feathered and tarred ! 
Oh. they are worse than Haverlev's Minstrels, 
Yes, the cats in our back yard. 
Tral a 
le, tral a 
la, &c.

PAT ROONEY'S SONG AND DANCE. 
Composed by B. H ART. 
Copyrighted by A. J. FISHER, 1879, 
Here I 
am, an Irish lad, that you can plainly see, 
I've traveled this world o'er and o'er, till I 
got to this land 
of the free. 
From Dublin Bay I 
came away, I 
never fret or sigh, 
For I'm always gay, both night and day, this son of Erin's Isle. 
CHORUS. 
Yes, I 
am an Irish ranting blade, and that I 
never deny, 
And I'll give you all a 
chance for to see the way I 
dance, 
As they do in Erin's Isle. ( Repeat.) 
The other day I 
went astray, I 
never shall forget, 
When a 
pretty little Irish girl oh I 
by chance had met. 
She showed me home, that I 
will own, and this was her reply: 
" 
You I 
do vdore, and there is something more, you're a 
son 
of Erin's Isle." 
Yes, I 
am, &c. 
For to return home once more my mind is fully bent, 
And when I 
arrive on the shamrock shore, won't there be a 
grand event. 
My friends and my relations will greet me with all smiles, 
To welcome home one of their own, a 
son of Erin's Isle. 
Yes, I 
am, &c.

McCluskey, the Politician. 
As sung by PAT ROONEY. 
Copyrighted by A. J. FISHER, 1879. 
I'm a 
man that's known both far and near, 
McCluskey that's my name, 
An all the politicians, sure, 
Are envious of my fame ; 
I 
got a 
grip in the auld Sixth Ward, 
And ye bet I 
make it pay, 
An' I 
hould a 
high position 
Upon Election Day. 
CHORUS. 
As I 
walk through the ward, 
As proud as a 
lord, 
The gang rise their hats and cry out, " Clear 
the way." 
Oh for style an' for air, 
There is none to compare 
Wid McCluskey on Election Day. 
It was on last election time, 
I 
ran for Alderman, 
My political antagonist 
Was a 
loafer named McCann; 
But I 
trated all the boys I 
met, 
From Harlem to Cow Bay, 
And they said they'd vote nine times for me 
Upon Election Day. 
As I 
walk, & c. 
Election time came quickly round, 
I 
wint to make a 
speech, 
But the gang they knocked thesplatform clown, 
And I 
loud for help did screech. 
Now although I 
didn't get the place, 
Just listen to what I'll say, 
I'll play them all for suckers 
On next Election Day. 
As I 
walk, & c. 
Jerry Slattery. 
As sung by PAT ROONEY. 
Copyrighted by A. J FISHER, 1879, 
Jerry Slattery was a 
tailor, he was ninety years of age, 
He had a 
son named Micky, a 
play actor on the stage. 
He'd play Romeo with his sister, for diamonds he'd give her 
pork and beans, 
Then little Michael Slattery would tear the bedclothes up for 
scenes. 
He is crazy, he is lazy, he broke his leg last week, 
He is always singing, always dancing, and playing tragedy in 
his sleep. 
He is always talking of Mary Anderson, he'd support her on 
the stage, 
Sure last night he got so crazy, we had to put him in a 
cage. 
CHORUS. 
Then it's little Michael Slattery stole his father's pants, 
He cut them up for tights to do a 
song and dance ; 
When his mother was asleep he cut her hair off for a 
wig, 
Now little Micky Slattery is doing an acrobatic jig. 
He cut off his father's whiskers to play Hamlet and King Lear, 
Took a 
shot gun to his mother and made her walk off on her ear, 
He learned his sister dancing, cut off eleven of her toes, 
Now little Micky Slattery is singing tenor through his nose. 
For he's dramatic, he's lunatic, he is clean gone off his base, 
His father and his mother say he is a 
Celebrated Case, 
He says he takes the cake, as an actor he beats them all, 
Next week he plays Julius Caesar down at Solomon Duff's 
hall. 
Then it's little, &c.

Katie Dear. 
As sung by PAT ROONEY. 
My Katie dear, my Katie dear, 
It's her I'm going for to see ; 
I'm going to take her to a 
dance to- night, 
And it's happy we will be, 
She's not very stout, she's not very thin, 
But I 
want you all to understand, 
To sing a 
song or dance a 
jig 
She can beat all the girls in the land. 
CHORUS. 
She can sing, (Aril) 
She can sing, ( Sym.) 
She's my Irish colleen everybody know. 
Arrah, whenever a 
fiddle begins to play 
Now this is the way she goes— ( Dance.) 
My Katie clear, my little Katie dear, 
We're going to be married soon; 
I 
feel so happy, boys and girls, 
And as proud as the richest gossoon. 
And when we settle down in  
here, 
All the people in the town we'll invite. 
You can bet your dime we'll have a 
good time. 
We'll not go home till broad daylight. 
We will sing, ( Sym.) 
We will dance, (Sym.) 
We'll have a 
good time, now remember, sure, 
And when old Murphy squeezes the pipes, 
It's then we'll welt the floor. 
Murphy's Great Walk. 
Written by JAS. RICHMOND for, and sung by, PAT RooNv. 
Copyrighted by A. J. FISHER, t879. 
Arrah, my name is Isaac Murphy, 
And I'll have ye all to know 
That I 
was born in China, 
Near the county of Mayo. 
I 
can walk six months and never stop, 
I 
can run faster than a 
train ; 
Faith, I 
am soon going over to England, 
To bring the belt Rowell took back again. 
CHORUS. 
I'll walk the first hundred miles on my head, 
The second on my toes; 
The third I'll walk on my eye-brov‘s, 
And the fourth upon my nose. 
The fifth and last I'll walk on my ear, 
Then the Atlantic I 
walk across, 
Sure the Philadelphia Bladder says, 
Of all walkers I 
am the boss. 
I 
can walk from here to Australia and back 
In about three days and a 
half, 
Or around the world in a 
hundred hours— 
When I 
told O'Leary he gave .me the laugh. 
I 
can walk for a 
year without any sleep, 
And keep waltzing around on the track 
It would take me ninety minutes, just, 
To walk from here to Germany and back. 
I'll walk the first hundred, & c.

Oscar Magee. 
Written by JAMES RICHMOND for PAT ROONEY. 
Copyrighted by A. J. FISHER, 1879. 
Oh, ladies and gentlemen, I 
now tell to ye 
About a 
young man named Oscar Magee; 
He had cast-iron teeth, and he never eat hash, 
When his money was all spent he had to pawn his moustache. 
He had a 
brother named DeWitt, in Brooklyn he did preach, 
He married old Corbin down at Manhattan Beach; 
He married them in a 
cellar, he must have been in a 
trance, 
The wedding present was a 
cast-iron overcoat and a 
wooden 
pair of pants. 
He bought a 
gold mine in Hoboken, and he found nothing 
hut rocks ; 
He went crazy and mad and cut his throat—with a 
pair 
of socks. 
He was found guilty of arson and stealing twenty gold rings, 
Then he was taken 
to a 
coal 
yard, and hung by the 
shoe strings.

Played Base Ball.

My name it is O'Hallohet, 
I'm a 
man that's influential, 
I 
mind my business, stop at home, 
My wants are few an' small, 
Some blackguards ' tother day did come, 
They were full of whiskey, gin and rum, 
An' they took me out in the broilin' sun, 
To play a 
game of ball. 
They made me carry all the bats, 
They nearly drove inc crazy, 
An' they sent me ou n " ceutre field," 
But I 
paralyzed them all, 
, 
put up me hands to catch a " fly, ' 
Holy murther, it struck me in the eye 
And they hung me on a 
line to dry, 
The day I 
played base ball. 
I 
took the bat an' hit the ball 
I 
thought to San Francisco, 
An' thin around the bases 
Three times I 
ran them all, 
But thin the gang began to howl, 
An' they said ould man you made a 
fowl, 
An' they rubbed me down with a 
Turkish toy. 
The day I 
played base ball. 
Two reporters begged to know me name, 
An' presinted me wid a 
medal, 
An' they asked me for me photograph 
To hang upon the wall, 
They said that 1 
had won the game 
Th,ugh my head was broke and my shouldet 
lame, 
An they sent me home in a 
cattle train,

As Sg*g with unbounded applause, by PAT Ro•-niEr, at 
the Olympic Theatre. 
All the trials and troubles— 
To you I 
will relate— 
That I 
have had to undergo 
Through being a 
candidate; 
I 
always lived a 
quiet life, 
Until one Mike McCann, 
He came to me, and says, Duffle, 
You must run for Alderman. 
CHORUS. 
'Twas in the 7th Ward below, 
In a 
neighborhood they call Cork Bow; 
Where the boys of me made a 
holy show, 
When I 
ran for Alderman. 
It was in McCann's back room, 
That night they nominated me; 
I 
axed the boys to have a 
drink, 
As they gave me three times three; 
They drank and smoked, they smoked an,1 drank, 
'Till drunk was every man; 
'Twas all at the expense 
Of poor Pat Duffle, the Alderman. 
'Twas in the. &c. 
But when election day it came, 
I 
found out very soon, 
The boys had all gone back on me, 
And were voting for Muldoon; 
And when I 
axed the raison why— 
To laugh, they all began— 
Saying, we don't want no Tarrier, 
For to be our Alderman.

But with my daughter Mary Ann I

For she's learned a

Since Mary Ann learned how to dance, 
I

She's out all night ' till broad daylight, 
A

On every moonlight plc-the sure my daughter can be found. 
And when I 
hid her stay at home she says, ' Go feel around ;" 
And on starlight excursions, where the band ; lays Flewy-

'Tis there I'll find my Mary Ann a

FISHER. 
My name it is McGinty, yes, 
I 
live on ham and flour, 
With O'Leary, the walker, I 
came here, 
For to walk a 
mile an hour, 
About half past twelve o'clock last night 
A 
gang gave me a 
terrible fright, 
They woke me up and set mc tight, 
For to walk against O'Leary. 
They took Inc to a 
great big field, 
And with alcohol set me crazy, 
They stripped me clothes off to the skin, 
And it made me feel so lazy; 
It was then the gang commenced to talk, 
Saying who is the terrier going to walk. 
And they said they would hang me if I'd batik 
When I 
walked against O'Leary. 
The first mile I 
walked my legs were weak, 
And the gang commenced to holler, 
They spr inkled salt upon the track 
And hit me with an iron dollar. 
All the other walkers were ahead, 
Eating sponge cake, pie and bread, 
0 
heavens, I 
wish that I 
was dead, 
When I 
walked against O'Leary. 
I 
walked until I 
catched the cramps, 
Around and around the track, 
All the ladies threw bouquets at me, 
There was a 
corn upon my back; 
The judge told me it was time to stop 
As amund the track like a 
chicken I'd flop, 
For the want of a 
whiskey I 
tlumgh I'd drop, 
The day I 
walked against O'Leary.

Good evening, to ye, Gents and Ladies, 
I've come to make a 
little call ; 
I'm descended from the great O'Grady's, 
The best 3ou'll find in Donegal. 
A 
year ago I 
took the notion 
To sail across the briny deep; 
The sea was in a 
great commotion, 
I 
could'nt get a 
wink of sleep. 
CHORUS. 
They call me roaming Mick O'Brien, 
I'll fight ' till I'm pushed to the wall, 
t 
The young girls they were all a 
crying 
When I 
came from old Donegal. 
Sure I 
was known throughout the country, 
And devil the one with me could dance; 
I 
was the first in every nation— 
And drunk when I 
had the chance ; 
I 
used to drive the women crazy, 
So nimbly I 
could shake my feet; 
-1hey never found me slow or lazy, 
At jigging I 
could not be beat. 
They call me roaming Mick, &c.

Sung with great applause 
by PAT ROONEY. 
When I 
landed in America, I 
settled in New York, 
And wandered up and down the streets a 
trying to get work, 
Ent evei y 
place that I'd inquire, oh this is what they'd say. 
For heaven's sake take that dicer off, for that is what gives 
you away. 
CHORUS. 
Go where I 
may, roam where I 
will, 
The blackguards they do say— 
Oh! Take that dicer out of the draft, 
For that is what gives you away. 
I 
walked the streets from morn ' till night, my heart was 
sore distressed ; 
And whin I'd ask for work they'd say, oh, go, pull down 
your vest ! [key pray ; 
They said go on to the platform and with Moody and San 
And get those peg tops taken in, for that is what gives you 
away. 
Go where I 
may- &c. 
I 
went into an eating-house to get a 
bit of bread, 
'the waiter called me Jimmy Lush and put me on my bad. 
I 
axed. the Mayor for a 
job and to me he did say— 
You'd better get another face, for that one gives you away. 
CHORUS. 
They say, have you time to carry a 
trunk? 
How long are you going to stay ? 
And get those side-boards taken off, quick, 
For that is what gives you away.

Sung by PAT ROONEY. 
PreSeSted to FIELDS and H ANSON. 
Give my boxing- gloves to brother, mamrnie, when I'm dead, 
When the sexton puts me under in my little bed ; 
If the job is like to throw him when the string he jerks, 
Get some little boy to show him how the old thing works. 
[Repeat last line. 
Mamma, buy me a 
bran new Ulster, hire a 
Pullman car, 
Give me a 
bath of Florida water, I 
see the gates ajar ; 
Give me a 
dose of paregoric—there's nothing about me mean, 
Give the sexton half a 
dollar to see that my grave's kept green, 
[Repeat last line. 
Give my chewing gum to sister, I 
don't want it any more, 
On my lips it raised a 
blister that was awful sore ; 
Sing to me the Last Rose of Summer—mamma, don't you cry, 
For in the clouds I'll raise a 
racket, in the sweet by and by. 
[Repeat last line. 
Sprinkle my body with powdered sugar, smear me over with 
tar. 
Cover my form with peacock's feathers—I 
want to be an 
angel, ma; 
Let me bite the old torn cat's tail off, she can't ketch no mice, 
Let me go bathing with the girls—it's naughty, but it's nice.

And graduated, from Old Donegal;

Big politicans and office-seekers—

To make me Governor of the 6th Ward 
I 
am well acquainted throughout the City, 
From the Battery to the Harlem Flat—

[Copyright, 1872, by JouN Clauses & co.] 
Sung with great success by PAT ROONEY. 
I'm a 
lighthearted Paddy, a 
rate Irish laddy, 
I 
went to America strange wonders to say ; 
I 
sailed from dear Cork for the port of New York, 
I 
was eighteen long days a 
crossing the say. 
When I 
arrived in the land I 
was tuck by the hand 
By a 
blaggard who said, " Paddy, come go 
me, 
And I 
will show you the city, the sights are so pretty." 
He says, - What's your name ?" says I " Tim Flaherty.' 
CHORE'S. 
I'm Tim Flaherty, arah, gaze upon me ; 
A 
lighthearted Paddy is Tim Flaherty. 
He showed me around, the sights were soon found, 
I 
viewed them with wonder and astonishment: 
When he bade me good-bye, tears came in my eye, 
I 
found he'd been through me, and took i
-v'ry cint, 
What to do I 
didn't know, where was I 
to go ; 
So I 
wint to the Coort, and explained to the Judge. 
He called me a 
pauper. a 
vagrant and loafer, 
And gave me six months in the Island above. 
I'm Tim Flaherty, (tc 
So I 
shouldered my bundle, and homeward I 
wandered 
Ould Erin forever, oh, she is my joy! 
It's here I'm at home, and never will roam, 
For she's good enough for a 
rale Irish boy. 
Sure, there's whiskey galore, just here by the door. 
And beauties you ne'er can find afar o'er the say 
And the girls are so pretty, so nate and so witty,

Kind friends if you will listen now, 
My woes I'll now tell you ; 
My heart is nearly broken, 
And I 
don't know what to do; 
No matter where I 
chance to go, 
Nor wherever I 
may be, 
The blackguards cry as I 
pass by, 
O'Reily, you're N. G. 
If I 
go into a 
tavern, 
And call out for a 
boos, 
The gang says I 
must treat them 
Or their frendship I 
will lose ; 
And if I 
do refuse them, 
Their heads they shake at ma, 
And sing out Philadelphia— 
O'Reily, you are N. G. 
It was just before election 
I 
was called to make a 
speech,
,, 
For a 
friend of mine, 
Whose name was Thomas Lich; 
The gang was there, I 
do declare, 
And when I 
did begin, 
They said, for God's sake, fire him out, 
Where did he get his wind ? 
T. couldn't speak a 
word at all, 
They made such a 
terrible noise; 
And all at once I 
felt a 
brick 
Hit me between the eyes, 
And through the door I 
fled, for sure) 
Sure they meant to murder me, 
And when I 
was outside 
I 
heard them cry, 
O'Reily, you are N. G. 
The slang the gang is using now, 
You'll hear from every lip ; 
Its shoot the hat ! and get it boiled , 
And don't you lose your grip! 
They say I'm too fresh, and too bran new. 
And will I 
ever drop, and stag his nips, 
And skip the gutter, and hit him with a 
ir 
The children there are using the slang, 
its well as every one. 
They'll say to me, go take a 
bath! 
And why don't I 
take a 
run ? 
And then they'll say, 
Go stop the coat, so long as Tra Ia la lee'

Is when they bawl—

YOU KNOW THE SL ATE IS BROKE. 
Copyright secured, 1876, by A. J. FISHER. 
As sung by PAT ROONEY, at the Olympic Theatre, 
In these now hard, uncertain times, 
They do things very queer; 
If you hav'nt got the ready cash, 
You cannot get your beer; 
The man behind the bar will say, 
Just by way of a 
joke— 
He'll shake his head with a 
meaning smile— 
You know the slate is broke. 
CHORUS. 
You're welcome in, to spend your tin, 
To have a 
drink or smoke; 
But you'd better put the money up, 
For you know the slate is broke. 
When you're daily labor is ended, 
And to walk you feel inclined ; 
As you pass along the busy street, 
How many friends you'll find ; 
They'll say to you come and take a 
drink— 
You'll return it with a 
smoke; 
But you'd better put the money up, 
For you know the slate is broke. 
You're welcome, & c.-
Perhaps you'll make a 
night of it, 
The fun will run so high; 
You'll get drinking by the bucket-full, 
And always getting dry; 
But when the sober morning comes, 
You'll feel like a 
hungry moke ; 
To think you've spent your ready cash, 
And know the slate is broke. 
You're welcome, &c. 
It's one word more I'll say to you, 
And then I 
will be done; 
I 
hope that I 
have pleased you all, 
And have offended none; 
But before I

My advice I 
hope you'll take ; 
Don't let your slate hang up too high, 
Or it may fall and break.

I 
rambled on the street ; 
The gay saloons were lighted bright,

While passing through a 
lane; 
his wages he was giving fast 
For that which crazed his brain. 
His wife at home, though she was stars 'd, 
The baby she must rock, 
And yet, that wretched man was drunk, 
just after twelve o'clock. 
Come, roam & e. 
And then there was another scene, 
I 
think it has been told, 
I 
saw a 
man escape from jail, 
The guard was bought with gold. 
He stole so much he is revered, 
And rich men round him flock ; 
And who can tell where this man went 
Just after twelve o'clock ! 
Come, roam, &lc, 
Now soon I 
reached the river's side, 
And paused there for a 
rest ; 
'Twas there I 
saw a 
poor young girl, 
Her babe clasped to her breast: 
Her marriage was a 
mockery— 
She jumped out from the dock— 
A 
shriek ! a 
splash 
th waves rolled on, 
Just after twelve o'clock ! 
Come, roam, & c,

W-h-a-e-k ! Paddy's the boy. 
There's a 
three-legged stool, with a 
table to match 
And the door of the shanty is locked with a 
latch, 
There's a 
nate fether mattrass all bustin' with straw, 
For want of a 
bedstead, it lies on the floor. 
Arrah! me honey, & c, 
There's snug little bureau, without paint or gilt, 
Made of boords that was left when the shanty was built: 
There's a 
thiee-cornered mirror hangs up on the wall, 
The divil a 
face has seen it all. 
Arrah! me honey, &c. 
He has pigs in the sty, and a 
cow in the stable, 
And he feeds them on scraps from the table ; 
They'd starve if confined, so they roam at their aise, 
And come into the shanty whinever they plaise. 
Arrah! me honey, ix. 
He has three rooms in one— kitchen, bedroom and hall , 
And his chist is three wooden pegs in the wall ; 
Two suits of owld clothes makes his wardrobe complete, 
One to wear in the shanty, that same for the street. 
Arrah! me honey, &c. 
He can relish good victuals as ever ye's ate, 
But is always continted with praties and mate ; 
He prefers them when cawld ( if he can't get them hot), 
And makes tay in a 
bowl when he can't get a 
pot. 
Arrah! me honey, &c. 
There is one who partakes of his sorrows and joys, 
Attends to the shanty, the girls and the boys ; 
The brats ne thinks more of than gold that's refined), 
Out Biddy's the jewel that's set in his mind. 
Arrah! me honey, &c. 
The rich may divide their enjoyments alone, 
With those who have riches as great as their own; 
3ut Pat hangs the latch-string outside of his door, 
And will share his last cent with the needy and poor. 
Arrah! my honey, Jo.

Good evening to ye, kind friends, we hope ye'll attention pay. 
We'll not detain you very long with the few words we have 
to say; 
It's about the Yankee blagards and the slang at us they flings, 
And when we go out after us they shout, " There goes Bar-
num's Simies Twins."

They say that we're ould terriers, 
And of course that our hearts stings; 
But worst of all is when they bawl— 
" 
There goes Barnum's Simies Twins." 
[REPEAT.] 
They call us fie- face terriers and bifel-backed galoots, 
And if we dare to look at them, sure they say they'll break 
our snouts ; 
They're always making game of us, and calling us such funny 
things, 
lint worst of all is when they bawl, " There goes Barnum's 
Simies Twins." 
They say that we're ould terriers, &c. 
Wer'e going back to Ireland, for here we cannot stay, 
We can't stand their slang and abuse, for they are at us night 
and day; 
We wish they were in the tenepensery, or the place that they 
call Sing Sing, 
Or that the devil had them all, and their Barnum's Simies 
Twins. 
For they say that we're ould terriers, &c.

We are two sons of Erin, 
We just came over here, 
From far across the deep blue sea, 
From a 
place we love so dear; 
With main and might, day and night, 
Our efforts have been in vain, 
We had no rest, so we think it best 
To go back to the Ould Dart again 
CHORUS. 
Oh, why did we ever lave it (sym.) 
Our hearts they now crave it (

We arc two Irishmen, 
Both with might and main ; 
All day we tread for work and bread, 
We'll go back to the Ould Dart again. 
When we left old Ireland, 
With spirits light and tree, 
We took a 
trip in a 
great big ship, 
And landed in America; 
The politicians met us, 
And said to us quite plain— 
Tweed with a 
pang, gave away the gang, 
And is back to the Ould Dart again. 
Oh, why, etc. 
And now, kind friends, we'll say good bye, 
We'll sing to you no more, 
We're going to cross the raging sea, 
To the home we do adore ; 
And if we have not pleased you, 
We hope you won't complain, 
But with just cause give us applause, 
We're going back to the Oulli Dart again. 
Oh, why, etc.

Never to see you, to speak to you more,

With sorrow, acushla, my cup's flowing o'er, 
Farewell, alanna! farewell, asthore. 
Farewell, alanna! farewell, asthore, 
To friends and to kindred and scenes loved of yore, 
Oft when in silence and sadness I 
mourn, 
To Erin and you shall my spirit return, 
Still in your heart darling let me reside, 
E'en though in far distant lands I 
abide, 
Still remain true to the vows pledged of yore, 
Farewell, alanna! farewell, asthore. 
Cuonus. 
With sorrow acushla, my cup's flowing o'er, 
Farewell, alanna! farewell, asthore. 
The Beaute. 
Oriinally sung by the " Irish Emperor,;," FAVOR and SmELDs, a:. the 
Theatre Comique Providence. 
Your attention now we ask for a 
couple of years, 
"lo a 
story we will relate, 
It's about a 
purty Irish girl we met while we was walktng, 
She was hanging on a 
slaughter-house gate. 
She was as purty and as sweet as a 
cow, 
Such clothes you never did see ; 
he had a 
darling little bonnet with a 
poodle dog upon it, 
She's the Irish girl that winked at me. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, my, wasn't she a 
beaute, 
Tra la le, skip the gutter, the baby's got a 
tooth ; 
Wrestling pots, that was her chits', 
And her sister was a 
boarding-house cook. 
My name is 
Patsey Marley, and the daisies call me 
Charley, 
I'm a 
double-breasted acrobatic Mick ; 
My name is 
Patsey Marley, and the daisies call me 
Charley, 
I'm a 
double-brLasted acrobatic Mick. 
The other day we thought we'd take a 
little walk, 
For to try and see the daisy ; 
While walking down the street, by chance we her did 
meet, 
With a 
man about six foot eight. 
Says I : " Excuse me, my dear, 
But isn't your name Arabella?" 
She hit me such a 
poke that my neck she nearly broke, 
And silt knocked me head and heels in a 
cellar. 
Oh, my, wasn't she a 
beaute. & c.

THE BEAUTY OF LIMERICK. 
Words by E. 
HARRIGAN. 
Music by BRAHAL 
I 
sing of my loved one, an idol to me, 
Though parted we are by the deep rolling sea, 
My thoughts gladly wander to Erin's green shore; 
Where dwells my treasure, mavourneen astore. 
By the side of a 
brooklet, a 
clear running stream, 
I 
fancy I 
see her, my Irish colleen. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, there's no girl fairer nor lovelier than she, 
My beauty of Limerick, Acushla Machree. 
sigh when I 
think of our farewell good-bye, 
How you strived for to keep the sad tear from your eye, 
Saying, Paddy, God save you, and send you safe home 
To the heart that is melting for you all alone; 
Sure (Iota I 
remember the promise I 
gave, 
how I'd go back to Ireland when money I'd save. 
0h, there's, &c. 
The Merry Little Fat Grey Woman. 
Sung with great success in England and America, 
By JOLLY NASH. 
A 
merry little woman with a 
funny little eye, 
He, he, he, he, he, ha ! 
A 
very merry fattish man was sitting very nigh ; 
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha ! 
And got a 
little nearer, just to have a 
little chat, 
When both began a 
laughing and they never knew what at. 
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha! He, he, he, he, he, he! 
A 
funny little dumpling shape the lady was in make, 
And he a 
double dumpling seem'd, which did her fancy take 
And with a 
chuckle, said at last, I'm thinking, Sir, thatwe— 
Are very like each other in our figure, he, he, he! 
He, he, he, he, ha, he, he! Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha! 
CHORUS. 
Oh! my merry little fatty, fatty, fatty, fatty, fatty, 
With a 
funny, funny, funny, funny, funny little eye, 
With a 
funny. funny, funny, funny, tunny little eye, 
With a 
funny little eye, ha, ha, ha, ha, with a 
funny 
little eye, he, he, he. 
They really shook with laughing, and their laughing shook 
He, he, he, he, he ! [ the floor. 
And striving to restrain themselves, it made them laugh 
ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha ! [ the more ; 
The glasses jingled, bottles clink'd, at which the company 
Began to mingle in the laugh, and never was such glee ; 
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha ! He, he, he, he, he, be ! 
He always took a 
pinch of snuff, whenever pleased or vex'd 
And taking out his box for one, it somehow gave prr text 
For titt'ring anew, and his fair neighbor with a 
cry 
Of joy, exclaim'd, do you take snuff, how funny, so do I. 
He, he, he, be, he, he, he! Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha! 
Oh! my merry, &c. 
This pleasauL little lady he escorted home that night, 
He, he, he, he, he, ha ! 
And on the next he took her to the Op'ra, with delight ; 
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha ! 
But when the dancers did appear she whisper'd as they sat, 
What fairy forms a.ud figuring, we should not do for that ! 
Hs, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha ! He, he, he, he, he, he ! 
Why, No, said he, but we should do, I 
think, for man and 
wife— 
I've thought the same, she laughing said, I 
have upon my 
life ! 
And so this merry dame and he, ( my story to condense,) 
Got wedded soon, at which they've been a 
laughing ever 
since. 
He, he, he, he. he, he, he ! Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha ! 
SPOKEN. — And they've got a 
funny little baby, with a 
funny little eye—just like its funny little Mamma's, and 
iv:L;a1 its funny little Papa looks at it, he exclaims— 
Cnonus, 
Oh ! my merry little fatty, fatty, fatty, fatty, fatty, 
With a 
funny, funny, funny, funny, funny little eye, 
With a 
funny, funny, funny, funny, funny little eye, 
With a

WHEN only a 
year in this country, 
And a 
month in this wonderful town; 
Strange things I 
have seen and stranger things heard 
Which to me appeared queer I 
must own; 
don't want you to think I'm perfection, 
Nor I 
wouldn't be indeed if I 
could, 
Yet whenever I 
go among the rich or the poor, 
TIn.re is some one to say I 
am no good. 
Cnoncs. 
Por the boys in the street they cry out 
'In a 
way can't be misunderstood; 
Will you ever go home to old Ireland; 
Murphy, lay down, you're no good. 
When first I 
arrived in the city, 
To a 
lirst-elass hotel sure I 
went; 
Straight up Broadway I 
r 
mbled, 
To view all the sights I 
was bent; 
Into a 
neat little gin-mill I 
wandered, 
Like a 
r. al Irish gentle an should; 
Whe the puppy that sto t' behind the bar, 
Says you can't hang me up, you're no good. 
For the Boys, a;,4 
Says I 
do I 
look Ike a 
hangman,: 
Or an: of that rascally crowd; 
Who in Ireland for less than a 
shilling, 
To Lake a 
man's lit' 
would he proud: 
No, indeed, now my friend, you don't know me, 
Thou.2,-lipoor I 
might be and need food, 
Yet there is not a 
man in the country, 
Begorra could say I 
am no good 
For the Boys, & c. 
When at home I 
was a 
bit of a 
boxer, 
And could hold my own with the rest, 
And in many an off hand encounter, 
I 
was known to have come out the best; 
Yet, I 
hardly reached Castle Garden, 
Scarcely knew, be dad, where I 
sto d, 
When a 
shaver shot up to 11ly shoulder, 
Says Murphy, lay down, you're no good. 
For the Boys, &c. 
This saying at first did surprise me, 
But now I 
am used to it all, 
And along with the rest of the gang, 
I 
can daily be seen at the hail ; 
Now when the poor and the sick need assistan c, 
By you all it is well understood, 
There is not a 
man in the ward 
Will say Murphy, lay down you're no good. 
For the boys in the street, they all shout. 
In a 
voice can't be misunderstood, 
There goes Mr. Murphy the solid man, 
Pare any of you say lie's no g

Wid every invited guest, 
We've pudding and cake and porterhouse steak, 
Wid the bones of a

Gould watches, cups and rings, 
We give three cheers for the pioneers, 
And thin the CoMpany sings. 
Thin forward, march, etc.

Murphy's Dream. 
Written by GEORGE M URPHY, and performed by GEORGE and Jona 
M URPHY. 
George and John Murphy stayed out a 
whole night, 
And the truth is they drank too much beer, 
And when they got home they both were so tight, 
That both of their heads felt quite queer. 
" 
Let's sit down and rest ourselves," George said to John ; 
" 
Let's try and recollect where we've been ;" 
So they sat down, but, oh, in a 
minute or two, 
They were asleep and beginning to dream. 
Now dreaming is funny—your mind wanders away— 
Some dream n 
they are a 
king, some a 
goat, 
Why, I 
dreamt t'other night, peculiar to say, 
I 
was an engine on the elevated railroad. 
But the Murphys they dreamed that in Paris they were, 
Looking for a 
first-class hotel, 
In their valises was gold, but how it got there 
Neither of the Murphy's could tell. 
They dreamt George was a Dutchman, and that his name. 
was Jake, 
With his clothes tore, and bald-headed at that, 
That John was an Irishman, and from jail he did break, 
That his name wasn't John, but was Pat ; 
Among lunatics surely they thought that they were, 
Who they tried to kill, strange it did seem ; 
That they were arrested and caught in a 
snare, 
This the Murphys.all saw in their dream. 
They dreamt to the gallows they both had to go, as their 
sentence was they had to die ; 
That they mounted the scaffold, John quickly, George slow, 
and that neither attempted to cry. 
They dreamt that hanging them wasn't severe, 
But imagined that it would cause lots of fun ; 
That the soldiers and sheriffs all stood quite nen, 
To make sure that the murderers were hung ; 
They dreamt that the trap fell and that they were dead, how 
strange the sensation did seem, 
But the truth was the beer had got into their heads and 
caused such a 
ridiculous dream.

COR.—The judge told me that unless I 
got some minister 
or preacher who knew me to vouch for my character, he'd 
send me up to give sparring exhibitions with Joe Coburn

I 
sent for Senator Bob Hart, and he got me out right away.

DAN.—Good avening, Cornalius. 
COR.—How are you, Dan McCarthy? 
DAN.—Where was you going the other day when f 
saw

Sir John Astley 
sent me a 
letter by telegraph asking me to keep my eye on 
things for him. 
DAN.—Did you do as he asked you ? 
COR.—I 
tried to, but nearly got in a 
muss over it with the 
doorkeeper. 
He says to me : " You're in such a 
hurry, man 
(Harriman), people will think you're interested. 
DAN.—An' is ( Ennis) that all the trouble you had ? 
Co.—Well, he made me feel kind of _Leary before such a

COR.—Who arrested you ? 
DAN.—Captain Williams arrested me for assault and bat-
tery. 
He was going to Blake a 
man's jaw for interfering. 
COR.-011, oh ; what did you do ? 
DAN.—He arrested me for striking a 
match. 
glad you're out, but I've been arrested myself, 
DAN.—Shure, man (Sherman), I've been to Washington to 
see the President. 
He's ( Hayes) a 
friend of mine. 
COR.—Have you any influence? 
I 
have an application in 
as watchman on the Elevated Road—watching the tracks to 
see that no dogs or cattle get on them. 
DAN.—Well, I 
have some influence, and can get you a 
good job. 
COR.—Can you ? 
What as ? 
DAN.—Up in the Park, inspector of goats ! 
COR.—You're giving me a 
kid ? 
DAN.—No, I 
am not. 
You're stretching it, but it's a 
soft 
job. 
I 
can get your brother a 
job, too. 
Co.—What to do ? 
DAN.—Keeping the rest of your family from going to Sing 
Sing. 
Con.—You wouldn't do for a 
job like that, as all your 
family's there except yourself, and you'll follow them as soon 
as you get your trial. 
DAN.—You're too sharp. 
I 
see I 
cannot down you, al-
though you are a 
stranger in the city. 
Have you been around 
visiting the different places ? 
Con.—I have some. 
Do you know a 
good way for me to

'Well, let me ask you one. 
What makes a 
hog grunt? 
DAN.—I 
don't know. 
There's no one touching you. 
COR.—Why is your mouth like the sounds of a 
dying man 
coming from a 
hospital ? 
DAN.—I 
give it up. 
Why is your mouth like the sounds of 
a 
dying man coming from a 
hospital ?

Ha, ha, ha !

FOREMEN ON THE ELEVATED ROAD. 
Here we are, two light-hearted Irishmen, 
We hold our heads as high as any in the land, 
We shun all Irish like Pat Rooney ; we want you to un-
derstand 
We're foremen on the Elevated Road. 
Two dollars a 
day is all the pay we get, 
In our gang is Mike the Bite, alias the Weehawken Pet. 
We keep our men to work, and never let them set 
Like the foremen on the Elevated Road. 
CHORUS., 
Then give three hearty cheers for Cornalius and Dan, 
Who can warble a " Come all ye" like true-born Irishmen ; 
We like no interference when in charge of our gang, 
Do the foremen on the Elevated Road. 
Every morn at eight o'clock we get them all together, 
'Tis then we call the roll, in wet or shiny weather ; 
It makes but little difference—they're all as tough as 
leather, 
Are the laborers on the Elevated Road. 
At half-past five at night, ' tis then that we get done, 
To our wives and children home we very quickly run ; 
They say my boy is like his father— the little son of a 
gun, 
Oh, oh, we're proud foremen on the Elevated .Z.oaxl.

much. 
No Bummer will refuse to drink when asked at any time, 
unless he receives a

v,!rage to be fourth-proof camphine, which is liable to affect 
the breath.

blime organization.] 
All played-out and indigent Bummers, having become lin-
able to " stand up to the rack," will immediately proceed to

of green. 
In England your roses make mighty fine posies, 
Provoke Scotia's thistle you meet your reward; 
But shure for its beauty an Irishman's duty, 
Will teach him his own native plant to regard. 
St. Patrick he set it, with dewdrops he wet it, 
And often to cherish and bless it was seen, 
Its verdures are rare too, it's fresh and it's fair too. 
And blooms but in Ireland's own Island of green. 
The sweet little Island, Sz.c. 
A 
sprig from each stem, forms a 
rich varied gem, 
More brilliantly bright than the dew on the thorn, 
Together unblighted unsullied united, 
It blooms a 
bouquet beauty's breast to adorn. 
Oh ! long may they flourish, may heavens dews nourish, 
Each warm kindred soil where the emblems are seen, 
May no fatal blunder, e'er tear them asunder. 
But long be they wreath'il in the Island of green. 
The sweet little Island, &c. 
Success to old Ireland, its bog and its mireianci. 
There's not such a 
universe under the sun, 
For honor, for spirit, Fidetity, merit, 
For wit and good fellowship, frolic and fun. 
With wine and with whiskey when once he gets frisky, 
An Irishman's heart in true colors is seen ; 
While with mirth overflowing, with love it is glowing, 
With love for its own native Island of green. 
The sweet little Island, (Vc. 
O'Hoolahan, What Der You Say? 
Composed and sung with great success by CHARLES A. 
GREAR, America's 
Own Mimic, and kindly dedicated to my friend JOHN F. 
FIELDS. 
Good evening to you, one and all, 
I'm glad to find you well, 
To listen to my tale of woes 
That I'm about to tell. 
I 
cannot take my daily walks, 
And I'll tell you the reason why, 
The gang all shout as I 
walk out, 
O'lloolahan, what der you say ? 
CHORUS. 
They're setting me almost crazy now, 
And I'll tell you the reason why, 
'or the gang all shout as I 
walk out, 
OlIoolahan, what der you say ? 
I 
stepped into a 
restaurant 
To get a 
bite to eat, 
I 
thought I 
would enjoy myself, 
And none of the gang I'd meet 
The waiter looked at me and laughed . 
Says I, give me a 
custard pie 
When through the hall he dm loud y 
bawl 
O'Hoolahan, what der you . ay . 
They re setting me airciost, Xi 
JUST OVER. 
Written and sung with great success hy Mt.ss Ftotm Mount, 
I 
came front Tiperary, 
A 
few short momns ago, 
With spirits light and airy, 
I'm an emigrant you know, 
Pray let me ask yer pardon, 
Smile on me if yer please, 
For I 
came from l'iperary, 
So far beyant the seas. 
Crionus. 
For I'm just over, just over, 
Just over from the old Country, 
Just over, just over, but I'll soon go back again. 
But now I'm going to leave ye, 
I'm going far away, 
I'm going to leave the land I 
love, 
That's dear America, 
I 
am going back to my birth- place, 
In that little Isle so green, 
The home of all true Irish, 
And the best place that I've seen. 
CHORUS. 
Forliii just over, just over, 
Just over from the oid Conntrv, 
Just over, just over, but ill soon go back again

String Clam Jimmy. 
Written and sung with great success by NED TALBOT. 
AIR 
" Champagne Charley." 
Some time ago there was a 
fig, 
Who used to go about, 
A 
screaming " Who'll buy my string clams, 
I 
feel so awful stout." 
This fig he was the size of a 
pig 
A 
feeding in the sty, 
And the only thing that happened him, 
He had a 
string clam eye. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, String Clam Jimmy was his name, 
His old woman never could make him tame, 
He'd roar with fright both day and night, 
For String Clam Jimmy was his name, ta ta. ( Repeat.) 
• Now Jimmy he fell in love one day 
With a 
girl with cross-eyed feet; 
She said she would not let him go 
Until she'd cut his teeth. 
She busted his poor pocketbook, 
Which made him fell so sore ; 
She gave him the slip and split his lip, 
Then skipped right out the door. 
Oh, String Clam Jimmy, &c. 
Dear Jimmy is contented now, 
He never goes about, 
He says bad times has spoiled the trade, 
Now don't that nigger shout. 
He feels so weak, he's got a 
cheek 
About three ton and a 
half, 
He looked so nice they put him on ice, 
Now how's that for a 
laugh

American Fortune-Telling Car 
ds .— This is the`old-
est and most widely known pack of Fortune-Telling Cards. We have 
published it for years, and the demand is continually increasing, 
These Cards are arranged and printed in series—Hearts, Clubs, Dia-
monds and Spades—and each of these into K for King, Q for Queen, 
tied K 
for Knave, and numbers I, 3, to 10. 
The Cards are arranged in 
four rows, and are to be read according to directions. 
Many of the an-
swers depend upon the position certain cards bear to other cards. Tim 
method of playing is somewhat complicated, but the directions have 
been made so that very little study will suffice to an ordinary under-
standing. 
Many professional Fortune-Tellers use these cards, and we 
are in receipt of letters in relation to them from all parts of the U. S.

courting Cards.— This Series of Cards has been arranged 
to meet a 
want frequently felt by young people—a 
want of means of 
expressing one's sentiments in such P. way as to be non-committal. 
Many young ladies are visited by 
-Ltlemen who are either too diffi-
dent or too fearful of a 
repulse, to venture upon asking the momentous 
question. 
The lady is restrained, by custom and a 
sense of propriety, 
from doing anything that would seem to be an unladylike encourage-
ment. As a 
result of this dilemma, many lives are spent as an unloved 
tedious existence, which mis-ht have been prolonged and enjoyed in the 
happiness of matrimony. 
This pack of Cards will overcome the diffi-
culty, and being in the shape of questions and answers, will cover every 
phase of courtship. 
The sentiments conveyed therein need not he 
adopted by the parties to the game as their own, unless it accords with 
the state of their affections, which fact makes a 
further explanation un-
necessary. 
The playing of these Cards is not restricted to two players,-
but may be enjoyed by evening parties  -

" 
A 
Little Book has lately appeared in print at Mr. A. J. FisuEn's, 98 Nas 
sau street, called the " Little Flirt." We cannot say that we recommend 
it to our young lady and gentlemen readers, as we think it would only 
encourage the bad habit of" flirting." 
Unfortunately, there is enough 
of it done without any further necessity of explaining "km, when and 
where to do it," and this little volume would advise and initiate the un-
corrupted in practicing what is commonly called "flirting." 
'Pile N. Y. Evening Telegram writes: " We have lately seen a 
neatThtle 
book, bound in Morocco leather, costing twenty-five cents, cal* the 
" 
Little Flirt," published by A. J. 
FISHER, No. 98 Nassau Str&t. 
It 
gives information of the modus operandi of flirting, and of the mean-
ing of every motion of the handkerchief, fan, glove and parasol. As 
there is nothing at all objectionable in the volume, and ito contents 
might afford some innocent amusement to many, we do net hesitate to 
recommend it to our younr, 
lady and gentlemen readers."
