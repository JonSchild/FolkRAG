00:01 Question 1 
1.   Thinking back, what are your very earliest memories of, or about, weaving? 
A. Woleaian: Hare hobwe liwaney tefaliy igawe mmwal yamw kabung teor iwe nge metta

Interviewee in English: 
When I started to learn weaving, I learned first from the sister 
of my mother’s mother, Letalimerip Petra. She was the first to 
teach me to weave. I then moved to Yap, and in Yap, Done 
(Donesia), one of my mother’s sisters, and also my mother’s 
younger sister, Linda, taught me how to weave. They taught 
me the correct method of tying the threads together, and they 
also taught me how to make the supplemental weft design 
called “taabw” that is woven into both ends of “peg” style 
lavalava. 
 
01:01 Question 2 
2.   In your mind, who is the one person you most associate with weaving in your life and 
why? 
A. Woleaian: Lan yamw niniwan nge iteoiu semal ye kail yamw fil ngali reli yamw 
kabung/fefortog teor? Iwe nge yebwe mwel hobwe hamatefa fal?

lalolai nge ye mataf yal hasukul reli min peigil teor, iwe iye 
mennen e fil ngali. 
 
Interviewee in English: 
Donesia, my aunt, is the one person I was comfortable 
learning from because she was patient with me and taught me 
in a way that I understood and could remember. She is the one 
person I am most comfortable working with and learning about 
weaving from. 
 
 
01:35 Question 3 
3.   Why is weaving so important to you?

rebugutam hare wechiyelamw nge ye wei selapiye, bwe hobwe 
mwel hobwe hara ngali bwakingomw me hariya. 
  
Interviewee in English: 
Lavalava are a huge part of my life as I have learned that there 
are many uses for them in our culture. They are what all the 
adolescent girls and women wear; it is their one item of 
clothing. You can also give them as gifts to family members, 
your peers, and friends. It has much value, like money to us. 
We also use them when asking for pardon of wrongdoing in 
the community, and in exchange for many other things, 
including land and food.  
 
02:16  Question 4 
4.   How has weaving or woven skirts changed over your lifetime, or since the lifetime of 
those who taught you? 
A.   Woleaian: Ifa senegal yal teor me kabungul teor niniwel tog reli yamw giula me 
kabungtog ye holatog igela? Hare ya liwe tangi yatokawe ho kabung me yatol malewar me

Interviewee in English: 
When I started learning to weave, the person that taught me to 
weave told me how make the outermost part of the edge of a 
lavalava, and then how to make the designs for the half and 
half pattern of weaving. She told me to make sure my nylon is 
even on both sides so that when the warp is transferred from 
the warping board to the loom it would be easier to begin the 
weaving process. I was also taught that the supplemental weft 
design we stitch to the two ends of the “peig” style are not just 
random designs, but rather they are specific designs, and each 
design has a specific design that should be paired with it. But, 
today, people are no longer pairing the designs to their specific 
pair. They are just stitching random designs, or designs that 
are faster to stitch, just so they can finish it. In the old days, 
each family or clan or weaving group had their own designs for 
the outermost edge of the lavalava, and also for the the 
supplemental weft designs, and they were stingy with their 
designs, and they kept them for themselves and their 
3 
 
daughters. Today people are copying each other’s designs. 
  
 
 
03:49 Question 5  
5.    If you could talk to your great-granddaughter about weaving, what would you want to tell 
her? 
A.   Woleaian: Hare iga hobwe haingali laiun laiul laum sari shobut kofal teor/foril teor, metta 
menne ho tipeli hobwe haingali? 
Interviewee in Woleaian: 04:00 Ibwe haingalir bwe retewai hashey lago menne fasiul

Interviewee in English: 
I would tell them not to lose the knowledge and skills and 
original ways of weaving, and I would also tell them of its 
significance, value, and importance to us as weavers, as island 
women, and as wearers of lavalava*. It is our money, our 
clothing, and they should know and value its importance to us 
and it’s many uses in our islands and culture. 
 
 
* Interviewer’s Note: A ceremony is done for a girls coming of age, and all her aunties come 
with leis and turmeric and woven skirts to dress the girl and share their wisdom and 
expectations of her as she enters womanhood. This includes distancing herself from her 
male family members and males within the community. Once a woven skirt is put on an 
adolescent girl, she can no longer play or climb trees. She is required, by culture, to do the 
women’s work.
