Dear Mrs. Hawes:
 
I am writing at the suggestion of my sister-in--law, Barbara
 
Scholz, who is one of your students.  Barbara has told me about
 
the novel and exciting course in folklore which you conduct; I
 
certainly wish there had been such courses when I was an undergrad-
uate.  She has also mentioned that you have an unpublished manu-
script on children's games.  If you have not already promised this
 
manuscript elsewhere, I should very much like to look it over. As
 
you may know, The University of Chicago Press is probably the
 
leading American publisher in the field of folklore, with several
 
titles by Richard Dorson and the very popular FOLKTAT.F
.S OF THE
 
WORLD series.  I want to enlarge and improve our list in this area,
 
and your work sounds like just the kind of material I am looking
 
for.  I do hope you wi
ll let me examine it.
 
I enclose our standard author's questionnaire form.  If you
 
decide to submit your manuscript to this Press, please fill out
 
the questionnaire and return it to me.
 
I shall look forward to hearing from you.
 
Yours sincerely,
 
Philip Krapp

Dear
 
17
 .
rapp:
 
Thank you so much  for your cordial letter concerning
 
my manuscript on Negro childrens' games.
 I feel most negligent
 
to have delayed answering it for so long, but ixkxdxkorw§txxxoh
 
the manuscript itself has been at Do8bleday Doran in New York and
 
I had hoped each day I might hear from them one way or another.
 
Actually, they do send me encouraging notes from time to t
ime, but
 
they still have not made up their collective mind.  Should we agree
 
to sever our rather tenuous relationship, I will certainly take
 
advantage of your kind offer and s
hip to  the manuscript off t
o you
 
for examination.
 
I suspect Barbara may have benn a bit over-enthusiastic
 
in her letter.
 I know the book has good stuff in it, but it does not
 
really fit any of the usual pattern-,
 0
 t
i:
 is  WIa t  i
 
giving Doubleday so much trouble.
 I have attem tcd both to describe
 
how to play the games and to explain why these particular games are
 
the ones played by American Negro children, and t in this process
 
have included large, though somewhat disguised, dollops of sociology,
 
history, psychology, ethnomusicology and folklore.  The end result
 
is a bit too informal, I suspect, for z folklorists (w
ho don't
 
really ±tx k like to play games) and too informative for elementary
 
teachers and hard-pressed parents who just want to know how to tame
 
the tigers one more day.  However, I keep seeing the pattern as a
 
whole: the world of the child as a place where serious preparations
 
are made for an emergence into tke an incredibly strenuous and
 
contradictory adult life, and I am unwilling to produce a book o
 
just games or just research.
 If tkftx this still sounds possible t
o
 
you, I will be glad to sand it your way,  should Doubleday and I fail
 
to agree.
 
I i
ondcr, rorhaps, i
i  you are acquainted with the work
 
for some year -
,
 
my brothar
 
,
.lan Lomax, has been doing?  He has been engaged in
 
(
at the Anthropology Dept. of Columbia University)
 
a mammoth work of research/on folk song styles of the world and
 
is, I think, about ready with a book on the results.  Would you
 
perhaps be interested in examining it?  *t*zxAxx
txw xkx fxxT
 
x
t<
 
kxix i  It's a very important project,
 1tx
m utR* highly
 
controversial and, I believe, highly significant.  He my 0'  cour
 
have a publisher, but when I last heard from him he did
 
ddould you care to get in touch with him, he could be reach
 
t
hrou b Columbia.
 
L
ow v r, the life of the American Negro child, as I see it, is just
 
t
oo complex, too ironic and too contradictory to fit into a sir
imic
 
pattern, and I found it impossible to produce a simply patterned
 
book as a result.  I
f all this still sounds like a possibility t
o
 
you, I will be glad to sent the manuscript your way s shouL
 
Doubleday and I fail to agree.

Dear Mrs. i
iawes:
 
I
'll confess I wasn't very rapid in my answers to you, and
 
so perhaps I shouldn't be worried about the fact that I have, as
 
yet, no answer from you about our proposal for a contract for your
 
book STEP IT DOWN.  I did talk with your brother on the telephone
 
about a week ago, and he seemed to think that the contract terms
 
were quite low.  As I said to him, we based them on other books
 
containing music that we have published, but we are certainly will-
ing to talk further about terms.  If that i
s the reason I haven't
 
heard from you, please don't hesitate to write and l
et me know what
 
you think fair terms for a contract for your book would be.
 
I hope to hear from you before l
ong.
 
All best wishes.

Dear Bessie:
 
Well, I f
inally have s
ome really good news.  It looks as though a pub-
lishing company a
ctually wants to buy S
tep It Down, and I have just
 
written off a letter asking them to draw up a contract for us to s
ign.
 
S
o we may be g
etting a lump s
um of money in another couple or three
 
months to divide between the two of us.  As I wrote you, the writer's
 
money for this book is being divided equally between the two of us,
 
and we will both be listed as authors.  The songs will be copyrighted
 
in your and Alan's name just as all your s
ongs are.
 
N
ow what will happen is that we will get a payment which will be an
 
advance; we won't get any more unless the publishers decide to print
 
the book again.  So this money may be all that we will ever g
et, and
 
therefore i
t is very important that we handle the money correctly.
 
How would you feel about using yours to pay off the rest you owe on
 
your house?  I
 was talking to Alan about i
t,
, and he s
uggested that
 
either he or I
 might be able to help you arrange to do it with the
 
money you'll be getting; only, of course, we would have to know exactly
 
how much you owe and what the taxes are and s
o on.  If you would like
 
us to handle i
t for your we will, but we would have to get a lawyer
 
here to make i
t all legal and s
ee that nobody gets cheated, and that
 
would mean that we would have to correspond with whoever holds the
 
mortgage and has all the figures.
 
Honey, I
 want you to s
it do
wn and think about this, and also keep it
 
to yourself for a while - -  don't go telling everybody unless you need
 
to ask them for advice.  This may very well be the only money either
 
you or I
 will ever get from this book, s
o you must think carefully
 
about what you want to do with i
t.  You will have to s
ave s
ome of it
 
out for income t
ax, and the only way to do that is to put s
ome of it
 
where you can't possibly get hold of it until the tax is due, and then
 
do what you most want to do with what is left, because you really
 
must not count on g
etting a whole lot more.  The contract will be a
 
fair one; I
 will g
et a lawyer to look at i
t before it comes to you
 
and Alan will as well, but books just don't bring in very much income.
 
Now there are two o
ther things:  the book won't be a
ctually published
 
until n
ext winter, and the publishers will s
end you s
ome copies for
 
your own when i
t is published, s
o don't look for it until then.  And
 
lastly, don't run up any bills because you think you will be able to
 
pay them laLer; the contract is not s
igned and there isn't any money
 
yet and Butch and I are broke ana
an't help you out now.  Why don't
 
you think about the i
dea of getting your house clear when the money
 
does come?  S
end me or Alan the figures and let us get it done for
 
you.  We both love you very much and want you always to be comfortable
 
and not to be worried about where you can live,  lake care of yourself,
 
honey, and read this l
etter over again and be sure you understand
 
what I
'm s
aying.
 
Affectionately always,

Dear Marjorie Donnelly:
 
This will be less of a letter than a sequence
 
of brief notes and reactions.  I
'm keeping a carbon so that we
 
can possibly save time in future correspondence by referring to
 
point number something or other.
 
1)  1 gather that you feel the basic audience for the book
 
should be the teacher and/or headatart worker, etc.  Agreed; with
 
the added comment that I have had my greatest success with teachers
 
when I addressed them as adults and scholars  which they are.
 
Though t
eachers tend first to focus on mater ial (that is
 units
 
usable in the classroom) they vitally need the additional content
 
I
've tried to include, and many of them are fully aware of this.
 
2
)
 y own teaching "style", which I think I have unconscious-
ly reflected in the book, is to mix up the specific with the gen-
eral, to move rapidly fr o
m instruction to analysis to historical
 
background, trying to give as rounded a picture as I can within
 
any one slot of time or
ace,  I suspect this has struck you as
 
disorganization, and I am willing to admit that it may work better
 
when I do it than when I write it.  Still all my instincts tell
 
me not to let this book be r.sent.d in too much of a how-to-do-it
 
or fifty-famous

)  I think we have to fact up to the fact that some of these
 
games are playable cross-culturally and others simply are not.  For
 
instanc.
M1 the teaching techniques I can devise, with the ad-
vantage of personal demonstration and recorded sound, it still
 
takes me several hours to teach "Juba" to the average college class,
 
and some of them never do get it.  Therefore although I have made
 
an honest try in the book at explaining how to play "Juba" I would
 
be amazed if anybody really worked it out on the basis of my descrip-
tion alone; the crux is tat I doubt th.yw,uld want to that much.
 
However, "Juba" is enormously interesting whether
 
t is Dlaved o  
I think; the content of the verse, Mrs. Jones' discussion o
 
what she thinks it means -
-
 all this is fascinating and useful
 
information for any teacher.  Th* point to me is that much of the
 
usefulness of the book is in the tangential material rather than
 
the simple game descriptions; therefore we should guard against
 
presenting it as an instructional book alone.
 
-2 -
4)  This brings up Mrs. Jones and her occasional, appar-
ently irrrelevant remarks.  Since she is really co-author, I
 
feel it my responsibility to include as much as possible of what
 
she has to say, and often what she has to say is more important
 
than the material itself, I think.  I admit it sometimes is not
 
exactly on the point, but to r
oe the irrelevance ate both signif
 1
..
 
cant and captivating.
 I hope people will
 j this book, not just
 
it.
 (
I remember as a child reading W.W. Newell's GAMES AND
 
SONGS OF AMERICAN SCHOOL CHILDREN over -
-
-and over again  quite
 
fascinated by what he had to say, though I never recall playing
 
a single one of the games.  Do you know this book by the way?
 
You might like to look at it; it's a classic in the field and
 
a reprint of it has recently been put out in paperback by the
 
Dover Press.)
 
5
)  Part of my problem in reworking the book is to determine
 
which of your suggestions are motivated by "
literary" concerns
 
and which are determined by practicality
 how much can be got on-
to a page for instance.  Cèuld we agree that each song/game
 
should be, as far as possible, printed so that the title, game
 
directions, music, song text, comment by l
irs. Jones and relevant
 
analysis by me be printed on facing pages?  I haven't the foggiest
 
idea what the limitations are, of course; it would seem likely
 
to me that "Juba" and "
Sandy Real' as they now stand are longer
 
than can possibly be gotten onto two pages.  How much?  Should
 
I even be thinking about this at this stag.?
 
6)  Turning to the literary angle, I think I am basically
 
in agreement with you about the style; in places it is unnecessar-
ily highfaluting.  I will attempt to fix this up, and I will also
 
remove footnotes by reworking the information into the text.  Fur-
ther 1011 cut out cited references provided I can include a
 
descriptive bibliography.  This could be printed in small type
 
and 1 would only include a phrase or two indicating the parti
 
cular usefulness of each book in addition to the usual data pro-
vided.
 
7)  However, as a nod to my profession, I want to include
 
another page of annotations
 th.siL bbreviated references be-
loved by folklorists which indicate where other versions of the
 
same song or game can be located.  Folklorists do have their little
 
ways, and one of them is to affirm that any work which is not
 
annotated is rubbish and below their notice.  It seems to me a
 
small thing to do to keep them happy (and make them use the book);
 
I am working on the annotations now and will send them along.
 
This can be printed in very small type as no one except folk-
lorists will care at all to read it.
 
8
(  I am surprised at your reaction to the jntrpduct4ons. 
I had conceived of them as a special nod to the teachers -
-
 as
 
place. where I could include apecitfic suggestions about the
 
games in 3
j -
-
 which were hard, easy, which could be used in
 
special ways and so on.  Further, I had tried to set the historicj
 
social tone of the upcoming section very quickly and specifically
 
in them, so that teachers would not feel they b1d
. to read the long-
or "essays".  Perhaps I wrote them badly, but I still think some-
thing along this line is needed.
 
9)  The "essays"
 and I
'd like to leave the term out in the
 
book as printed
 just have a section titled "On Clapping" or
 
"On House Parties and Country Amusements" breaking up the book from
 
time to t
ime
 are far more generalized.  These are attempts at
 
major theoretical statements and are
 tied to any specific
 
section of upcoming material.  My idea was to put all the big back-
ground information here plus the lengthy stylistic descriptions
 
that seemed too obtrusive to include in the briefer more practie..
 
cally oriented "introductions".  Actually, I really JJ_
kq this organ-
ization and I sweated long and hard over it.  Perhaps if I recast
 
the introductions so they would seem more specifically pointed to-
wards teacher use you would feel more in agreement.  Actually, I
 
dust can't see working up "essays" to head each chapter
 and I
 
lIke the breaking up of the structure of game description.
.quote;
 
game.
'd.scription.
.quote by a lengthier piece of writing every once
 
in
 while.  Do you really think I
'm wrong about this?  (
m ci.
.
 
dent 41y, I have been considering the posstbltlity of including
 
the "note to teachers" material from the general introduction in
 
the chapter introductions, providing we continue to have them.  How
 
would that - -  as my daughters would say - -  grab you?
 
10)  A quite parenthetical point but one which I feel strongly
 
about.  I would like to keep the repertoire intact as I gave it
 
here, though the last section of stories and songs is less fixed
 
in r
ay mind.  This is the first time a complete game repertoire
 
has ever been published and I'd hate to chop it up.  It's a selling
 
poinç for on. thing.  I realize this hasn't come up yet (except in
 
connection with Vt
hger Names which I
'll simply rewrite so that It
 
"looks like" This Little Piggy!) but I expect it will and I
'd like
 
to get my two cents in first.
 
ii)  I will send
 you a reworking of the section you returned
 
to me by the end of the week plus reactions to the specific criticisms
 
page by page.  Is this how it should be done?  I am unclear on the
 
mechanics of this business.
 
I am awfully sorry to be so incredibly s
low.
 
I keep on getting sick; just now it's an abcegsed ear and a hor-
rible cough.  I hope to get things rolling now.
 
All the best,

Dear Bess Hawes:
 
I
'm sorry to be writing that I
'll be l
eaving Doubleday at the
 
end of the week for a new job at T
. Y
. Crowell.  One of my greatest
 
regrets is that we won't be working together on STEP IT DOWN.
 In
 
truth, we had hardly begun, but the book is such an interesting and
 
exciting one, I
'm sorry to he leaving it.  Mr. Seth Agnew, the manager
 
of our department, will be writing to you shortly to tell you who your
 
new editor will be, but in the meantime, if you have any ouestions or
 
problems, contact him directly.
 
The re-worked section of your manuscrint has not vet arrived
 
and I was beginning to be worried about i
t.
 I
s i
t possible that i
t
 
has gotten lost in the mail?
 
I wish you every success with the hook and I
'll certainly he
 
keeping an eye out for i
t!
 
All best wishes.

Dear Jo:
 
Thanks so much for sending STEP IT DOWN by Bess
 
Lomax Hawes and Bessie Jones over to us.
 We've
 
given this our thoughtful attention, and I agree
 
with you that it's an excellent book.  The problem
 
is that it's hard for anybody, even a writer like
 
Mrs. Haves, to put down on paper anything about
 
music--an audial experience--and to describe
 
physically active games and plays.  When you do
 
this, it becomes a text book practically.  So
 
I
'm afraid we have to let this one go by; we
 
just couldn't get the kind of sale for this book
 
in our Trade publishing that it deserves as a
 
wonderfully documented book about the folklore.
 
Thanks again for letting us see this one.

D
ear Bess Haves,
 
No, I am not forgetting about STEP IT DOWN and, in al
l hone3 ty,
 
I think it may take us quite a while to find the right publisher.
 
I would hate to start chasing university type presses right at
 
the beginning.  I f
eel that there i
s a g
eneral trade sale and
 
I do think it would be too bad to gi ve  up at this point and
 
settle for a university press.  I am not saying it may not come
 
to that in the end, but I think that kind of rea oning  
 
bit early.
 
Simon & Schuster did in  fac t  tur n it down and I enc 103e  thei r
 
letter.  I
t i
s now with Random House.  I realize your co-author
 
is probably very anxious for results and it i
s probably awfully
 
hard to appreciate the movements of the publishing busines;.

 been thinking over our conversat
..
 
.
.e 
Jet
. i
yed reactions.
 This is the way I see
 
could establish right now, if it needs to be further establi
 
at traditional play activities of black and white children
 
ross the country are structurally and stylistically differer'
 
body different value systems.
 This is based both on my own
 
:
les of collectania -
-
 several thousand items -
-
 and parallel
 
ilections published in folklore journals, etc.
 There are so....
 
.ortant gaps that need to be filled in (I mentioned the scanty
 
servatioris on play activities of  
Negro boys, and I would also
 
I
ke to do a study onI
'1exican-American games on which I have oni:
 
i
ited data) but I wouldn't exp ect th e resu
lt s to change
 the h
. 
what should be done with this in
 
s
s L
 e t re are three lines of approach:
 
1) That it should be fed back into the Negr
 
i
rnunity, presenting them with the fact that they and their chi
 
are a beautiful and yeasty tradition which is uniquely theres an , 
ich the majority community admires.
 This has to be done with s
 
Licacy, since the ancient stereotype of Yegroes being "natural
 
ngers and dancers has to be avoided, but I think it can be don.,
 
'
-hand, I can think of two possibly practical ventures: that
 
;
ething like the footage I have shot of the L
.A. children be
 
red into a film which could be used in teacher training progra:
 
in the schools themselves; this would be especially effectiv.,
 
think, if equivalent films could be done of other
 game traditie:
 
well.
 There's certainly enough material.
 Seccindly, that Negro , 
such as my frier!  i
rs. Jones be hired as consultants to teach, derr'  -
 
strate
 insert 7
,nme of these activities into the standard element
 
that their indigenous Negro origin be emphasi-
2
) That these activities be nresented to the
 
indication of the richness and depth of thei
 
;i Libor's tr ditioxs,
 however, there is a special danger here;
 
as I have watched attempts within the educational system to enlarg.
 
.nd enrich childrens' exoerierces by ex osing them to other culture:
.
 
it seems to me that we always manipulate the data slightly so that
 
it comes out to be simply exotic Americana.
 J
e never allow the real
 
cultural confrontation to ta1 e place, so that most of us grow up
 
Feeling that 1
1awaiians are really just like us except that they are
 
s
lightly aberrant tn such .

3)  That serious analysis of this data be funded
 
with the view to deter ut
hing its r

 feeding
 
these experimentally into the educational system itself.
 If you
 
that  :
e ro children are comfortable playing their own games
 
and not comfortable in the schoolroom -
-
 which seems to be pretty
 
obvious -
-
 what factors are in con 1ict: use oL7 space, att rition to
 
body dynamics, relation of leader to group, comiunication style,
 
what?  I once heard a sixth grade class of Negroes whose teacher
 
was reading poetry out loud while the class echoed each line back
 
to her; everyone listening commented on how precise and elegant
 
their enunciation was compared with their normally slovenly diction
 
(which was making their learning to spell difficult).
 The call and
 
response pattern is fundamental to Afro-American music; it was quit
 
clear that these children were doing something that was stylisticaL
 
comfortable for them -
-
 it really began to swing as they went alor
: *
 
This is the kind of thing I mean, but it should be
 
more careful analysis than has been done up to now.
 
I
'll try to work up some specific proposals
 
some of these points; in the meantime, my next visit to '
pew Yor
 
must unfortunately be based around my commitments to the rewpor
 
Folk Festival (July 26 through 28th).
 This means I could stc
 
your office and show you the film either dednesday or Thursdc
 
(July 24th -
 25th) or M

 I

Dear Bess:
 
August 5, 1968
 
Your letter of July 12 and our visit in Alan's office have been
 
much on my mind these past weeks without my being able to do much more
 
than reflect on these matters.  I have also shared your letter with my
 
colleagues for there are a number of implications of your work which
 
would naturally involve other people in this office.
 
Our experience in school change suggests that the links between the
 
sort of understanding that comes from a close study of peoples and the
 
introduction of the different knowledge into schools must be handled in
 
a sophisticated manner if one is to preserve the full value of the com-
munication.  In what sort of school setting, for example, would Mrs.
 
Jones' teaching and demonstrating most effectively cut through the con-
ventional views of the school's role, particularly where black teachers
 
may themselves negate the values in their own culture.  Well, we have
 
school projects and other work underway in the South and South West and
 
it may be possible to try out some things there.
 
We've spent our budget for the year and are rushing to get the
 
paper work done so that some vacation can be worked in.  After October 1
 
there will be a new budget.  Sometime in September would f
ind us in a
 
better position to respond to your fascinating suggestions.
 
After speaking with Alan and
 
showing your manuscript to Joseph
 
Republic and is deeply interested
 
piece about yours and Mrs. Jones'
 
directly.  At the same time, I am
 
refer any interested ones to Mrs.
 
With very good wishes,
 
NM/mb
 
Mrs. Rogers I took the liberty of
 
Featherstone, who writes for The New
 
in education.  If he wants to do a
 
study, he will get in touch with you

Dear Bess,
 
I do hope it was a good trip East you had,
 
Newport and all the rest.
 
Gloomily I returned from vacation to find
 
that Norton couldn't summon up sufficient
 
imagination to do STEP IT DOWN.  I am now
 
taking it up with Knopf -
-
-
 I hope with
 
more success.
 
Undoubtedly, I think it will see publication,
 
but I would just as soon it was something more
 
than by a university press.

 I believe she has a telephone but I don't have t

number.
 
She is a charmin2
,, friendly and cordial la y; how-
ever she is getting old now and I worry lest she overstrain herself.
 
At the same time she is living or
. the edge o
f real wart, and
 v  kin'
 
of paying work you might be able to get her would be of real importance
 
-
 
to her.
 She regards  Ian, by the way, as her "marager'.
 
You mi ht also like to look at a book by two friends
 
of mine,  uy and Candy Carawar
i, who have documented, thgough tape
 
recorded interviews and extensive photographs, the life of Johns Island,
 
South C
arolina.
 Their book, which has been put out in paperback by
 
Simon arid Schuster, is called Ain't You Got i

ife?
  
and is, in my opinion, a real c
lassic.

As for '
-
Irs. Jones, she looked a bit thin and
 
olr  when I saw her this summer; however, she sang with all her old
 
:
Eire.
 Since 'Ass :
-
:artus didn't make the purpose o  Ass .tro''s
 
visit clear to me -
-
 if there has to be a purpose, indeed -
-
 I
'm not
 
quite sure what to tell you about 'rs. Jones.
 There Ire a 7ew things
 
that mi ht be useful to know:  F
irst,  that :rs. Jones'  conversatioiial
 
style is both f
luent and circular; sometimes she only makes e
rrtional
 
sense to me.
 Then, like many hirhly expert people she is very tn ccu-
rate in the  rca of technical description.
 She needs to do it, not
 
talk about it.
 "
urther,  s
ince she is a representative of the  fro-
American cultural style, almost everything she does requires r group;
 
it just doesn't work as a solo performance.
 
The last thing that I mi'-ht mention is that she
 
considers my brother, .',.
Ian Lomax,  to be her "manager"; this is because
 
he has been able to get her some work From time to tiue -
-
 it is
 
strictly anl gnorary, i
tOt  a legal, position.
 i
:e and I have urged, her,
 
however, not to record, perEorm etc. ad lib for just anybody who

Dear Bess:
 
Dorothy Hassfeld, a representative in the Southeast of the
 
Foundation's Leadership Fellows Program, was just in and we talk-
ed about reaching teachers in the schools.  One of her Fellows
 
this next year will be Miss Lu Elrod, a white music teacher and
 
supervisor, who expects to spend the first semester 1968'69 at
 
U.C.L.A. on musicology.  Miss Elrod appears to be more successful
 
in working with black children than some black teachers. Dorothy
 
will suggest that Miss Elrod arrange to see you when she is out
 
there and would like her to meet Mrs. Bessie Jones before she
 
leaves Atlanta at the end of August.  Would you send Mrs. Jones'
 
address to Dorothy Hassfeld at this address:  Leadership Fellows,
 
805 Peachtree Building, Room 571, Atlanta, Georgia 30308.
 
Sincerely,
 
Marjorie Martus

The above sounds, on re-reading, a bit pere mptory.  You may not consider
 
i
t appropriate for a s
tranger to call on Mrs. Jones without i
ntroduction.
 
On the other hand, I
 would not have suggested i
t i
f I
 hadn't the impression
 
that the encounter would be a congenial one.

Dear Mrs. Hawes:
 
Telephone: 404876377U
 
Thank you for your letter of August 22 giving us Mrs. Jones'  address.
 Marj Martus
 
had let me peek at Mrs. Jones' games and songs which seemed of prime importance to
 
one of our Fellows, Miss Lu Elrod.
 
The Leadership Development Program is a special Ford project to fund rural teachers
 
in several specified areas so they can participate in study and activities else-
where in the country which seem particularly germane to their own interests and
 
local problems.  Miss Elrod has received operatic training (Baylor,  sullalter s
tu-
dent scholarship with the Houston Opera Company), and now sings professionally
 
in the Southeast.  Her primary activities, however, have been centered around
 
public school music teaching.  During the Fellowship year in Los Angeles,  she
 
will study in the department of ethnomusicology at U.C.LA.:  she wants to be able
 
to present more than classical5western music to school children, especially s
ince
 
we are working toward a desegregated society.
 
Miss Bernice Reagon has said some of Mrs. Jones' music i
s available on records.
 
If possible, we'll acquaint Miss Elrod with this material before she l
eaves for
 
California.  We hope there will be some way the two can work together at some
 
point during the year; your description of Mrs. Jones'gay, outgoing personality
 
and responsive wit is true of Miss Elrod.
 They should be able to hit it off
 
well together.
 
We understand the plight of the blacks in the rural Southeast,  s
ince some of
 
the Fellows are black teachers from these areas.  Mrs. Jones'  rights as a pro-
fessional musician certainly will be respected.
 
Thank you for your offer to help Miss Elrod when she gets to California.
 She
 
'
f
Lll certainly be in touch with you soon.

Dear Marjorie Martue:
 
A few weeks ago you s
ent me a letter which began "
In connection with
 
our telephone conversation the other day, I am enclosing a copy of a
 
letter from Larry Gotkin..."; however, Mr. Gotkln's letter was not
 
enclosed.  I decided to wait a few days before answering on the assump-
tion that perhaps the letter was following, but this proved to be a
 
fatal error.  The end of the s
emester caught up with me and I plunged
 
head-deep into a pile of term papers and exams from which I have just
 
emerged.  I hope there was nothing in Mr. Gotkin's letter which
 
required urgent attention on my part.
 
In the meantime, I have heard from Josephine Rogers that Harpers is
 
seriously interested in my book.  I am, of course, absolutely delighted,
 
and I am sure that I owe you most of the credit for getting their
 
attention.  I do thank you very much for all the trouble you've gone
 
to; and I hope the results will be worth all the time and energy
 
you've put into the project.
 
My co-producer on the Negro children's game movie tells me that the
 
laboratory is now re-doing the opticals for the fifth time!  Appar-
ently, i
t has been so long since they have worked with black and
 
white film that their technicians have forgotten how to handle it, and
 
he has had finally to go down and take them through the process a
 
step a
t a time.  The world is moving too fast for me; I have just
 
learned what the word "opticals" means and I am told that we won't
 
even be using film within another year -
-
 only television tape which
 
gets digested or something, not printed.
 
Thank you again; when the laboratory finally produces an acceptable
 
print, I shall s
end you the first one.
 
Hopefully,
 
Lomax Hawes

Dear Marjorie:
 
As you know I did have time to skim 
"the Hawes manuscript / I
t i
s as fine as
 
you and Irene Krull indicated.
 I would hope that a publisher could be found
 
to produce the manuscript in i
ts present form.  The writing i
s c
lear, relevant
 
and persuasive.
 
I would l
ike to suggest that the underlying ideas and songs should be extended
 
in their development.  Furthermore, the point of view presented in the manu-
script i
s closely aligned with our own philosophy of an instructional curriculum.
 
However, the problem is, how do you translate her manuscript into an on-going,
 
regular, and developmental c
lassroom curriculum.
 
The crucial i
ssue, it seems to me, i
s the teachers.  The teachers need more
 
explicit guides, training and support to introduce and maintain the musical
 
content described in the manuscript.  Having the Sea I
sland Singers come and
 
do short demonstrations would be a valuable way of breaking the ice.  But, how
 
many trips can they make, and how does  one make sure even if they did make a
 
trip, that the curriculum to support their work would be maintained?
 
Irene's observation, and one that you make, is that basically many of the
 
children know much of the content, and it i
s the teachers' job to permit this
 
to happen in the c
lassroom.  On the one hand, I agree with this point of view;
 
on the other hand, in the vast majority of cases this will not be enough to
 
make the curriculum work.  Teachers need to understand, have confidence and be
 
able to accept the very content that would emerge.  Also, they should be able
 
to extent
!
. and support what is introduced.
 While what the children do will teach
 
some of the other children, the teachers need to be in a position of supporting
 
and helping those children who do not know.

Having explored this music and  l
ooked at some recent t
raining programs in
 
music, I feel several observations are important.  Standard music instruction
 
in kindergarten c
lassrooms i
s very different from the kind of music described
 
in the manuscript.
 I
t i
s different in two major ways:  One, the music being
 
presented in ghetto schools is unrelated to the experience of the children,
 
and two, the teacher's style in presenting it i
s to sit at the piano, play
 
the song and not relate very much to the children in the c
lass.  What I l
ike a
 
about the music program described in the Hawes manuscript i
s that i
t i
s inter-
actional which i
s consonant with the kinds of games that we work on.
 Also,
 
as Irene points out these music games are non-competitive and participatory.
 
What might be done?  Some form of training program needs to be provided to
 
enable teachers to feel at home with the music and the approach.  For example,
 
I had Irene try to tach me one of the "Plays".  She has a music background
 
and had read the manuscript more carefully.
 She had considerable trouble
 
introducing it to me.  And, I had even more trouble l
earning the content.  While
 
the children would know many of these "Plays" and thereby support the teacher in
 
something new, most t
eachers are very uncomfortable trying to accomplish such an
 
activity without really knowing what it is about themselves.  Especially with
 
four and five year olds this would prove most difficult..  If such a curriculum
 
is to have impact and i
s to be disseminated, we need a training program for
 
teachers and supportive materials to help them introduce such curriculum into
 
the classroom.  What about the teacher who just i
sn't that good setting the
 
rhythm of the game?  Would i
t be possible to have records that provided support
 
during the early stages of  introducing the games?  I have used some of Pete
 
Seger's response records with four-year-olds and found that they helped to
 
establish what was going on.
 
Because much of this i
s visual or movement based, would i
t be appropriate to
 
make several films which described, in a teaching way, the e
lements required
 
to accomplish some of these "Plays".  What I mean by this i
s that often the
 
children pick up the rhythm of a "Play" much earlier and easier than adults,
 
especially middle c
lass adults.  Furthermore, most teachers have just never
 
been taught or encouraged to improvise lyrics, which I would see as a related
 
part of this as an extended music program.  An important part of this as a
 
curriculum i
s that it combines movement with music and both the movement and
 
music are already part of the child's culture.  By making use of the behavior
 
that the child i
s already familiar with, we bring them into the classroom and
 
school environment much more happily and in less restricted ways.  I have been
 
appauled at the degree to which the music in New York and Newark schools lack
 
a relevant rhythm and movement.

I would like to propose a meeting in December or January with Mrs. Hawes.
 
Among those at the meeting would be Dr. Fran Aronoff of Mills College of
 
Education.  Perhaps even before you receive this letter Dr. Aronoff would
 
have contacted you to read it.
 I am suggesting that Dr. Aronoff participate
 
because her orientation to music involves the use of games and game-like
 
situations of a non-competitive nature.  Also, she is oriented to the use of
 
movement with music and she is involved in teacher training.
 
The primary objectives of such a meeting would be to make recommendations as
 
to next steps.
 Should a proposal be written?  What would constitute the out-
line for that proposal?.  Should movies be part of a teacher training product
 
to arise from a possible proposal, etc?

I
 Owe you more than an apology for not having kept you
 
Up-to-date with our progress on STEP IT DOWN.  The manu-
script has gone into production and we shall be getting
 
a schedule Out to you in a couple of weeks.
 
I have suggested a minor change in the order of material,
 
that is the placement of the Notes to Scholars and Teac�
.-
E
),"s
 
at the back of the book.  They are no less useful there ) but
 
they are less obtrusive to the general reader.
 
I do,hot think any problems will arise from the use of
 
"Negro" at places in the text.  There is such a lack -of
 
objective criteria for the use of "Black,
' Negro, and Afro-
American." that I think they can well be used interchan-c-
ably - according to one's ear - as long as no one of the
�,M
l
 
is left out completely.
 
I also feel that the inclusion of "Coonshine" and "Daniel"
 
is a good idea.  Each in its way indicates a different ex-
pressive range no less spontaneous or genuine than the other
 
games and plays.  It's good to indicate that these too ar-
-
part of the heritage.
 
Mr. Brackman apparently forgot to check the copyright statu s
 
of these two additional songs, but I expect to hear from
 
him on this shortly.

 Though my book

ultimately unfair to both of us.

It was very exciting to read in the newsletter of Orff-Schulwerk in the United
 
s
tates that you
, have produced the film "Pizza Pizza Daddy-C".  For the past
 
ear I have been collecting black play chants and jump rope rhymes.  We have
 
1ack children whó,,ussed t
o our suburban s
chool from the Boston inner c
ity
 
nd they began teaching them t
o me last year.  As I began sharing them with
 
uet a few other children, it was no t
ime at all before they spread through
 
,he entire school.
 For months I listened, then taped and began transcribing,
 
nd it was then that I began to do research on the existing l
iterature, and
 
r
ound that very little has.been done.
 
got summer I had the opportunity to share many of these chants with
 
c
oll.agt.e from various parts of the country.  Their response was most
 
enthusiastic, so I have decided t
o prepare a collection for publication.
 
i
arriet Kiebanoff, who is a professional photographer, has agreed to col1abor
'
 
:
ith me, and has taken s
ome marvelous photographs of the children playing the
 
'
ames.  I think she has written to you asking about the film in connection wi
 
er work at the Mass. Dept. of Mental Health.  Last year, she and Norma Canner ,
 
•ho is a specialist in creative movement, did a s
tudy on the use of creit ve

and a time to dance",
 
t
iona1 Catholic
 
ucators Assn. asked me to write an article on the clay chants whien  i
-
.
 
opeer in the forthcoming March-April Issue.
 I suggested several months
 
'
hat they title the article, "Pizza Pizza Daddy-o"! .
1 an really delighted t
'
 
•
c
now that this chant exists also in California, and I can't wait t
o see you:
 
i
lm. However, apart from my astonishment at this extraordinary co-incidenc'
 
I am concerned, because I had also decided to title the book,  Pizza Pizza
 
Daddy-o".  I shall not go ahead with this plan if you object, or if this wc _
 
in violation of a copyright you
. hold.
 
I should most appreciate hearing from you as soon as possible, as my work is
 
nearly completed.  I don 1t mea' t
o infer for a moment that possibilities for
 
collecting more materials are exhausted
..  On the c
ontrary, I could go on for
 
many years I
'm sure, but I feel strongly that I must s
top where I am, because
 
these materials need to be shared.

Dear Caroll:
 
hank you so much f
or the announcements about the guitar-making school; I have
 
posted them in strategic spots around the campus.
 
As to the Bessie Jonas project, i
t i
s at l
ong lest becoming a reality.  I vi
 
'
L
)t bore you with the incredible story of i
ts vicissitudes. (
I had heretofore
 
ad the naive assumption that the American book-publishing industry was a
 
husiness and conducted on a somewhat business-like basis; I know better now.)
 
Aayway, after one episode of a publisher's l
osing the manuscript, two incom-
petent music editors, who kept editing my music manuscript with indelible
 
red pentel pens and returning i
t to me with the remark t
hat Mrs. Jones could
 
ot possible have sung it that way, and four copy editors who kept resigni
'
 
in mid-flight leaving the whole project to be started over again, I now ay
.
 
possession of galley proofs, and I beh
a
ve it will be out this fall.
 
he publishers are Harper and Rove; the working title i
s Step It Down: Ga
mes
 
and Plays of Afro-American Children by Bees Lomax Haves and Bessie Smith Jones.
 
Tt contains all Bessie's repertoire as of four years ago (when the manuscript
 
as finished'
.), as accurately transcribed as I could do i
t and keep i
t readable
 
£)r the general public.  All games are described in detail, dance steps and
 
verall dance style analyzed and described, and I hope i
t will be a useful
 
addition to the general library of books on the subject.
 
Would you be interested * perhaps, in reviewing a copy?  I
'll send your name
 
co Harpers as someone with knowledge in the field plus experience with Bessie
 
and perhaps we can wangle you a free copy.  I should greatly appreciate, j
ust
 
n a personal basis, having your reactions.
 
It was good to hear from you.  I miss those pi'aiar

t, I no longer have that kind of time myself any  ore.

 I can have a review cop'

(the article, not the photo)
 
I hope  r
on were satisfied with the way it came out.
 I'm glad that
 
we were able to include the soundsheet in the issue and have Butch's
 
voic
 on it.
 
I
c received a copy of step it Down, and I think it's great.
 Do

ht be possible to reprint one of the games in our Teas  -i

then
 
all right with you, do you know who we should speak to at Harper & Ro ?
 
C'
 
Since we also hope to have a soundsheet with that issue, perhaps  ,
rou
 
could also tell me how to find music to go with one of the gam
.
 
One more question; we received a copy of Bruce Jackson's book
 
of prison worksongs Wake UD Dead Man. 
Would you be interested in
 
A
rriting a review for us, or could you suggest soneono else woo o n
 
could do a good job?  If you would like to write toe rev er, let  u

know and I'll send it to you right away.
 Hope to hear from you soon.

Dear Bob Norman:
 
I was very happy indeed with the way the article on Butch came out
 
and with the soundaheet.  Actually, I hadn't listened to it, since I
 
was very rushed getti n
g ready to move to Portland for the summer, and
 
I expect I wouldn't ever have realized you had Butch's voice on the
 
soundsheet if you hadn't mentioned it!  You certainly took a lot of
 
trouble to locate a recording of his voice, and I do appreciate all
 
the time and care you put in on the project over a
ll  
•
 I
've sent copies
 
to all the children, and to Butch's parents and his brothers and sister,
 
and I am sure they will feel as grateful and appreciative as I do.
 
I
'm also glad you like Step It Down. I don't see any reason why a
 
reprint of one of the Eames couldn't be used in Sing Out!; at least,
 
I
'd be strongly in favor of it.  I am sending a xerox copy of your
 
letter to my editor, Kt ae e McCullough at Harper and Row, together
 
with my recommendation on the matter.  You could reach her by calling
 
593 7206; her office is at 10 East 53rd Street, New York 10022.  She
 
may have to turn you over to someone else in the legal department,
 
but she is the person who should first be approached, as far as I know.
 
As to recordings, there are two possible ways to go.  In the Discography
 
in the back of Step It Down is a list of Bessie's recorded performances
 
that have already been put out in record form, some on Alan's Southern
  
Journey series a d some on the Southern Polk Heritage series. I should
 
imagine, legally speaking, that reprinting already released material
 
would be the easier solution; I
'm sure, at least, that you could get
 
'
lan's permission without any trouble (providing he gets back from Europe
 
where he now is).  I don't know the ins and outs of the whole business,
 
but Al Richmond at TRO ) n les most of Alan's stuff, and could probably
 
advise you accurately.  If you like, I
'd be glad to write Al Richmond
 
for you, as far as that goes.
 
The second possibility, of course, would be for me to send you an exerpt
 
or two from the field tapes I made of Bessie working out here.  This would
 
also, I suppose, have to be cleared with TRO, since, as you notice, I
 
stayed completely out of the copyri ht issue as far as the songs themselves
 
go; it seemed to me it would only confuse matters further to have yet
 
another name added to the copyright list.  The problem here is that I
 
would have to get permissions from other people who are singing on my tapes
 
too: the Sea Islanders and some of the participants in the game seminar
 
at Idyllwild.  Also I
'm up in Portland for the summer and left those
 
tapes at home; however, should we decide this is the way to handle it, I
 
could have them sent me.
 
You can reach me at the above address until August 4th; after that I
'll
 
be on the move for a while until school starts.  Probably the easiett
 
thing is just to write to my old home address in Santa Monica; friends
 
staying at the house are forwarding my mail and keeping in close touch.

Dear Bess,
 
I have just received a copy of "Step It Down,t!
 and love it.  It
 
is a very good and valuable book.  I had expected a section of it from
 
you for possible use in Redbook, but now that I have seen it I realize
 
that I would not have been able to push it through in spite of the fact
 
that Mrs. Jones' counsel on introducing babies to the world is so sound.
 
Just the same I hope you'll keep in touch with me on the chance that
 
somwthir
 '
rou might ho working o
ct in the future will he suitable for
 
Redbook
 
I hope y
o
'o '
irr well  and th r."ir
