Speaker: There was a very definite difference especially in the children of those that lived
in town and those that lived outside of town. Those children that lived in town had all the
advantages. They could take dancing lessons, music lessons, and had more social life
among themselves because they lived close together, where out here in the country, we
were isolated. There was no such thing as dancing lessons or music lessons or anything
of that sort. Our folks couldn't take us to town for anything like that. We spent our time
playing with the animals on the farm. We had rabbits, chickens, cows, and I talked my
father into letting me have a couple of pigs and I had a goat. I loved working in the garden
and tending to the flowers. So our life was entirely different. The children in town used
to like to come out here and play with my goat and go on picnics. It was a real luxury to
me to get invited to go into town to play with someone or have dinner at the Inn with a
friend of mine that was living at the Inn. This was when I was older and had my bicycle
and could get there. These children also had the advantage of having their parents have
time to help them with their schoolwork. Where out here, when it was time for me to work
on my studies, my parents were either busy or tired and needed time for themselves to
read. I think in the country children were taught to be more self-reliant and not expect the
parents to help them with the work that was the children's work. We were provided for in
all the essential ways, such as food and clothing, but I think in the country people felt their
children had an obligation to carry on our own work particularly school work.

Speaker: We had two schools in Concord in my day. The kindergarten and first grade were
in the Ripley School, which was the former high school and was where the Hunt Gym now
stands. Then we went to the Emerson School which was across the street which is now
the old youth center, and there we went through the eighth grade except the second and
third grades. They were over in the high school which is now a vacant lot across from the
library. Between the Emerson School and the high school was a little school that had been
moved there from where the library is now and we had what we call today manual training.
From the eighth grade, girls and all went over there for one hour a day and in high school
it was an elective. There was also a school in West Concord which stood on the playyard
of what is now the Harvey Wheeler School. When the West Concord people were ready
for high school, they came to Concord center by electric car, which were around by that
time. Children from Bedford came here to high school by electric car and the children from
Lincoln also came here but by train. Also the children from Carlisle came here, and in my
class, there was only one that came from Carlisle by horse and carriage every day. The
transportation to school for most of us was by barge,which was on wheels. In the winter, it
was the same type of vehicle but on runners. Hay was put in the bottom of it but we used
to freeze to death. It took a long time, those horses were so slow. But in the summertime
we would have the curtains up on the barge and we didn't mind the ride. On the last day
school, everybody all around town collected wild flowers and decorated
Page 11
Speaker: the barges to see who had the most beautiful barge. But the winters were agony.
After the eighth grade you had to find your own transportation which was usually the
bicycle except in the winter when your father might have to drive you. The early 1900s
saw a new type of transportation, the automobile, come into use. I remember the first
automobile that appeared on Lowell Road, my father came dashing into the house calling
us all to come look at the horseless carriage. Everybody used to go out for a ride on

Sunday afternoons and everyone had a special or dress-up carriage for Sundays. It
was kept neat and clean and covered over during the week. I can remember the first
experience we had meeting an automobile. We were out riding and my father saw an
automobile coming and made everyone get out of our carriage and over the stone wall
while he held the horse.The same thing happened when we saw an electric car on a visit
to my grandparents in Bedford. As the automobiles came in, there were some people
who still retained their horses and carriages. The people in town had stables behind their
houses for their driving horses and carriages. In the country the farmers had farm horses
and a driving horse for their carriage for the women. In town many of the women had
maids, out here we had hired girls, and those women that had maids would go out riding
in the afternoons. One or two of them had coachmen. The ladies would sit in the back
with their parasols. I have one of those little parasols that I carried in a parade last year. I
remember <gap> from
Page 12
Speaker: Monument Street, the <gap> sisters from Sudbury Road and Nine Acre Corner,
and <gap> on Strawberry Hill Road. <gap> had a very handsomely outfitted coachman.
The electric car revolutionized country travel. It brought people to Concord and took
people out of Concord. It was a very happy day when the electric cars came especially for
the women. It made them more independent. They could go anywhere themselves. One of
the things the electric cars did was to give us Lexington Park. This was a joy spot enjoyed
by adults and children. It was a park on the Lexington-Bedford line. It was an attractive
spot with animals for the children and a fairgrounds with a stage where they had very
satisfactory vaudeville entertainment once a week. There was an afternoon and evening
performance, and it was very good, high-class vaudeville. When the automobile came,
people could then go to more distant spots and the park didn't last long after that. With
more and more automobiles being used, there became a need for better roads. Macadam

roads were developed using crushed stone, so many, many stone walls were taken down
and crushed for the new roads. After World War I, life in Concord was entirely different.
The men came back after having the experience of being away, and some had to find
different employment than what they had been doing. It just seemed the whole nature of
the town changed particularly in growth. With the coming of automobiles, more people
were coming out from the cities and building began. Of course, with the war, industry came
in which hadn't been
Page 13
Speaker: flourishing before. For instance, the harness factory in West Concord was
booming making harnesses for the horses used in the war. Business seemed to grow and
there were new avenues of business. end of excerpt M11 A(1)
