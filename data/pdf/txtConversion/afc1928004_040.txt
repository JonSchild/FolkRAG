SHE RATH GONE. 
Sung by H ARRY H OWARD, at CHRISTY'S Opera House, Chicago. 
SHE hath gone in the spring time of life, 
When the young heart, was buoyant and light, 
Ere earth with its sorrowing strife, 
Had cast o'er her spirit a 
blight. 
She was wandering with hope through the bowers, 
Where her footsteps delighted to stray; 
But the spoiler had looked 'mid the flowers, 
And she passed in her gladness away, 
Chorus. ' . 
She was wandering with hope through the bowers, 
Where her footsteps delighted to stray ; it 
But the spoiler had looked 'mid the flowers, 
And she passed in her gladness away. 
THE JOYS OF HOME. 
She bath gone from a 
world where the thorn 
Is concealed 'neath the breast of the rose, 
Where the skies which are brightest at morn, 
Will darken in gloom ere the close, 
Whore sorrow and wearying care 
The varying pathway attend, 
And the pilgrims, o'erborne with despair, 
To death's lonely chamber descend. 
She was wandering, etc. 
She bath gone to that radiant shore, 
Where the bowers are mansions of rest, 
Where weeping forever is o'er. 
And the spirit forever i3 blest. 
She bath gone to the land of delight, 
Where the angels of paradise rove, 
Where the pleasures forever are bright, 
And the song is the rapture of love. 
She was wandering, etc. 
THE jOYS OF HOME. 
THE world hath its delights, 
And its delusions too; 
But home to calmer bliss invites, 
More tranquil and more true. 
Chorus. 
Sweet are the joys of home, 
And pure as sweet are they; 
Like dews of morn and evening come, 
To wake and close the day. 
The mountain flood is strong, 
But fearful in its pride, 
While gently rolls the stream along 
The peaceful valley's side. 
Sweet are the joys, etc. 
SHAKESPEARE. 
Life's charities, like light, 
Spread smilingly afar, 
But stars approached become more bright, 
And home is life's own star. 
Sweet are the joys, etc.

Dey fought until de broke of day, and got dere bodies

DOWN THE RIVER. 
Opening Chorus. 
As Sung by CHRISTY'S minstrels. 
On the river is up and the channel is deep, 
And the wind blows steady and strong; 
Let the splash of your oars the measure keep, 
As we row the old boat along. 
Oh the water is bright, and flashing like gold, 
In the rays of the morning sun; 
ROATA.NCE AND REALITY. 
And old Dinah's away up out of the cold, 
A-getting the hoe-cake done. 
Oh the river is up and the channel is deep, 
And the wind blows steady and strong; 
Let the splash of your oars the measure keep, 
As we row the old boat along. 
Down the river, down the river, 
Down the Ohio;• 
Down the river, down the river, 
Down the Ohio. 
Oh the massa is proud of the old Broadhom, 
For it brings him plenty of tin ; 
Oh the crew, they are darkies, the cargo is corn, 
And the money comes tumbling in. 
There's plenty on board for de darliies to eat, 
And there's something to drink and to smoke; 
There's de banjo, de bones, and de tambourine, 
And de song, and de comical joke. 
Oh the river is up, and the channel is deep, 
And the wind blows steady and strong; 
Let the splash of your oars the measure keep, 
As we row the ole boat along. 
Down the river, down the river; 
Down the Ohio; 
Down the river, down the river, 
Down the Ohio. 
ROMANCE AND REALITY. 
An—" The Lonny Boat," 
A 
HAPPY life is that of a 
tar, 
At least so we are told 
By those who stay at home and write, 
Of sailors brave and bold. 
But oh, how soon their tune would turn, 
If once, before the mast, 
They'd go one jolly three years cruise— 
My word, 'twould be the last. 
I'd like to see those writing chaps, 
Some dark night go aloft, 
To " shake out sail, " take sail in," 
With hands so white and soft. 
I'd like to see them " slushing down," 
Or " scraping" in a " sling ;" 
I 
think that when they got ashore, 
They'd count it not the thing. 
I'd like to see them in a 
storm, 
Take one " trick" at the wheel; 
Get knocked down with a 
rnarlinspike, 
And see how that would feel. • 
To see them drinking water black, 
And very bilg,y too; 
So strong one holds his nose to drink, 
As I 
have had to do. 
To see them chewing old " salt junk," 
Tough as a 
buffalo's hide; 
So tough the very jaws will ache, 
As with a 
crow-bar pried. 
To see them to the " focastle" go, 
To get a 
bit of sleep, 
And wake with bedbugs covered o'er, 
About two inches deep. 
To see them lying in the " bunk," 
How it would cut their pride; • 
To wake and find their bedmates dear 
A 
nigger on each side. 
'Tis very nice to talk of " Jack," 
His joys by sea and shore; 
But let them try a 
taste of sea, 
And they would talk no more. 
SWEEP HO! 
ELECTION DAY, 
As Sung by JAMES BRYANT, with CHRISTY'S Minstrels. 
Now colored folks and citizens I 
pray you listen unto 
me, 
And darkey musicians just keep your strings in tune, 
For my true love has gone from me, the policeman did 
get hold of she, 
They've sent her up to Sing Sing for taking silver 
spoons. 
Chorus. 
So darkies all and citizens, 
Listen to him while he sings, 
lie's going to run for alderman, 
The next election day. 
Oh her brother's name is Weller, and is a 
clever feller, 
He used to sell umbrellas on the wet and rainy clays ; 
But he traveled on his muscle, so that clever man 
Judge McCunn, 
He sent him on the Island to try and mend his ways. 
So dailies all, etc. 
But when my love is free again we'll have a 
jollification, 
So darkies, I'll invite you all, and Sambo, you'll come 
too; 
And when my troubles all are o'er, I'm going to keep a 
candy store; 
I'll wrap myself in the American flag, whoop-de-doo-
den doo. 
So darkies all, etc. 
SWEEP H01;

Singing sweep ho! ho! ho! h.o!

To make smoky chimneys dere errors to mend,

With no fear in his heart, or soot in his eye. 
Singing sweep ho! etc. 
He stan's above all on de petty world, 
De commander ob de kitchen when ashes fall, 
'Tis a

To make de chimney smoke more clan before.

KISSING ON THE SLY. 
De ole man found out what I 
was arter, 
And wid a 
big stick he said he'd slaughter; 
He thought he'd stop my game if he could. 
(Spoken.) 
But he couldn't. 
De ole man came out, my feelings for to puzzle, 
'Way out in New Jersey; 
He loaded his blunderbuss up to de muzzle, 
And pop went de trigger right into my guzzle, 
I 
thought I 
was dead right away, 
(Spoken.) 
But I 
wasn't. 
I 
didn't go dar many times more, 
'Way out in New Jersey; 
To ring the bell and hear the song, 
And as my story is not very long 
You may think there's another long verse to 
my song, 
(Spoken.) 
But there isn't. 
KISSING ON THE SLY. 
Am—"Comin' thro' the Rye." 
His manly whisker swept her cheek, 
She uttered no reply; 
How could she part her lips to speak, 
While kissing on the sly? 
There's such a 
sum of smacking bliss, 
That Crcesus could not buy ; 
The honeyed worth of one sweet kiss, 
That's taken on the sly. 
Chorus. 
There's such a 
sum of smacking bliss, 
That Crcesus could not buy; 
NELLY HO'
WE. 
19 
The honeyed worth of one sweet kiss, 
That's taken on the sly. 
The maiden meek one kiss received, 
Demurely winked her eye: 
And with the air of one bereaved, 
She heaved a 
heavy sigh. 
Again the wayward whisker pressed 
Her cheek, she breathed " Oh my!" 
flew grateful to the burdened breast, 
Oh, this kissing on the sly! 
There's such a 
sum, etc. 
Though rigid rules declare the deed, 
To be a 
crime so high, 
No lover dare deny the deed 
Of kissing on the sly. 
Though pa's and ma's berate and prate, 
Till Dulcineas cry; 
The custom don't a 
bit abate, 
Of kissing of the sly, 
There's such a 
sum, etc. 
While leading thus a 
single life, 
What happier lark than I, 
When opportunity without strife, 
A 
glorious chance descry, 
To seize the dainty treasure, which 
No royalties outvie; 
No king, as I, is half as rich, 
Thus kissing on the sly. 
There's such a 
sum, etc. 
NELLY HOWL 
Written by M. CAMPBELL. 
'TwAs way down Souf, long long ago, 
A 
yaller gal did dwell; 
20 
DE DARKEY CREW. 
Her name was Nelly Howe, 
We sometimes called her Nell. 
Her figure fair, beyond compare, 
And her eyes black as sloe. ' 
Would melt the heart to love as sure 
As sunshine melts the snow. 
Chorus. 
Her figure fair beyond compare, 
Her eyes as black as sloe, 
Would melt the heart to love as sure 
As sunshine melts the snow. 
Time wore on, a 
stranger came, 
He saw my lovely Nell; 
He sought her parents, told his name, 
And said he loved her well. 
His money won her father o'er, 
They never thought of me ; 
My Nelly soon became his bride, 
And I 
then went to sea. 
His money won, etc. 
I 
sailed the ocean far and wide, 
Nor cared where I 
did roam ; 
With spirit broke, and sick beside, 
I 
sought my native home. 
Her 'husband said, that Nell was dead, 
And departed as he came; 
And she sleeps soundly with her child,

Has popped the question, ma, to me.

A BATCH OF FUNS. 
You must not go, my gentle dear, 
There's no use now a-talking; 
You must not go across the fields, 
With Billy Grimes a-walking. 
To think of his presumption, too, 
The dirty, ugly drover! 
I 
wonder where your pride has gone, 
To think of such d 
rover. 
What d'ye say, etc. 
Old Grimes is dead, you know, mamma, 
And Billy is so lonely; 
Besides, they sal', to Grimes' estate, 
That Billy is Me only 
Surviving heir to all that's left, 
And that. they say is nearly 
A 
good ten thousand dollars, ma, 
About six hundred yearly. 
What cry° say, etc. 
I 
did not hear, my daughter dear, 
Your last remark quite clearly ; 
But Billy is a 
clever lad, 
And no doubt loves you dearly. 
Remember, then, to-morrow morn, 
To be up bright and early, 
And take a 
pleasant walk with him, 
Along the fields of barley.

don't mean double cents, sir. 
A BATCH OK PUNS.

As thus a

Not long ago I 
knew, sir, 
To fly—he caught a 
fly, and then - 
Flew up the chimney flue, sir. 
Chorus. 
Bow wow wow, etc. 
But such a 
scene, was never seen, 
I 
feel quite sure of that, sir; 
As when, with bats, all hands essayed, 
To hit the bat a 
bat, sir. 
To make a 
pair, two'pears it takes; 
If cyphered out with care, 
You'll find each pair, though, worth two cents, 
If but a 
cent a 
pear, sir. 
Bow wow wow, etc. 
If one were ridden o'er a 
lot, 
He might his lot bewail, sir; 
If on a 
rail, most likely he, 
Would rail against a 
rail, sir. 
A 
certain knight, whene'er it rained, 
Gave to his horse the reins, sir; 
And rode at random on the road, 
Heedless of neck and brains, sir. 
Bow wow wow, etc. 
The captain gave the mate a 
rope, 
To carry up aloft, sir; 
And though he took it up aloft, 
It was not up a 
loft, sir. 
Another one was sent aloft, 
A 
certain rope to bend, Or, 
And then because he missed the rope, 
They gave him the rope's end, sir. 
Bow wow wow, etc.

Miss SurEY SMITH had flaxen hair, 
Her daddy had the pewter;

So nimble, lithe and brawny, 
The yaller fever took him off, 
Away to Californy. 
Chorus.

And when I 
heard that he was gone, 
"It's now," said I, " or never!" 
I

And caught and mounted Dobbin; 
But all the way I 
rode along, 
My heart, it kept a-throbbing. 
Bow wow wow, etc. 
And when I 
reached her daddy's house, 
My heart kept up a-jumping ; 
But when I

It kinder stopped a-thumping.

I 
knelt, and yet ere dinner; 
With honeyed speech, and winning ways, 
I 
had contrived to win her.

And slip his arm around her; 
When good gracious sake! she let him kiss

Were sitting in the corner; 
His name, I'm told was Joshua White, 
And hers was Patience Warner. 
Not much the pretty maiden said, 
Beside the younc; man sitting; 
Her cheeks were flushed a 
rosy red, 
Her eyes bent on her knitting. 
Nor could he guess what thoughts of him, 
Were to her bosom flocking; 
As her fair fingers, fast and slim, 
Flew round and round the stocking. 
While as for Joshua, bashful youth, 
His words grew few and fewer ; 
Though all the time to tell the truth, 
His chair edged nearer to her. 
017R NATIVE LAND. 
Meantime, her ball of yarn gave out, 
She knit so fast and steady, 
And he must give his aid, no doubt, 
To get another ready. 
He held the skein, of course the thread 
Got tangled, snarled and twisted; 
"Have patience," cried the artless maid 
To him who her assisted. 
Good chance wits this for tongue-tied churl, 
To shorten all palaver; 
"Have Patience," cried the dearest girl, 
" 
And may I 
really have her?" 
The deed was done, no more that night 
Clicked needles in the corner; 
And she is Mrs. Joshua White, 
That once was Patience Warner.

On

For thee thou lustre of the world; 
Still firm united we will stand, 
With banner high, and flag unfurled.

By freedom sanctioned, still is ours, 
Nor shall our noble tree be reft, 
While every branch is strewed with flowers. 
Chorus. 
Then hurrah! hurrah! ye sons of the free, 
Strike! strike the blot from treason's hand; 
For God, for fame, for liberty, 
For union, and our native land. 
Our country dear, our country dear, 
Shall faction spurn our holy laws? 
Shall freedom's sword, or freedom's spear, 
Be wielded in oppression's cause ? 
Our fairy fields, shall they be strewed, 
With brothers slain, by brother's hand? 
Shall fathers raise their arms of blood, 
Against the ensign of our land? 
Then hurrah I 
hurrah! etc. 
Our starry flag, our starry flag, 
Whose eagle sits enthroned above; 
Shall it not wave o'er hill and crag, 
Triumphant in the hour of fight? 
Let him who swells rebellion's cry, 
In civil strife but turn to thee; 
A

His bright sword strike for liberty.

THE DUEL 
As sung by the CHRISTY&

The Girl I 
left Behind me.” 
ONE Mr. Knott, with Mr. Schott, 
Into a 
quarrel got; 
The cause was what, no matter what, 
Their anger, it waxed hot. 
Then Mr. Knott, called Mr. Schott, 
Hard names,' no matter what; 
And Mr. Schott replied to Knott, 
In term, no matter what. 
Wrote Mr. Knott straightway to Schott, 
And Schott replied to Knott; 
Wrote Mr. Knott, again to Schott, 
And Schott wrote back to Knott. 
So Mr. Knott, from Mr. Schott, 
A 
deadly challenge got; 
DOG LOST. 
And Knott sent right back to Schott, 
That he declined it not. 
Big Mr. Knott, and Mr. Schott, 
Three glorious rounds then fought; 
When Mr. Knott, he got the shot, 
And Schott, he got it not. 
As Mr. Knott had missed his shot, 
And Schott had missed his not;

I

"I believe I

" 
Well, sir, you would hardly credit my sayin' so, but 
last week I 
unfortunately lost him." 
"You did ?" 
" 
Yes, sir." 
" 
How did it happen?" 
"Well, you see, I 
was walking down de street wid 
him, one day in de fore part ob de week, and he fell into

" 
You mean mud puddle." 
" 
Yes; and afore I

Wait a moment, Julius. 
You say he was ship-

"Yes, dat's what I

Why, I

Now I

Why, 'cause it was a

As sung by the Cmusrys. 
I WILL now then my troubles unfold, 
You must know, I've been sold; 
And l'm sure when my story I've told, 
Badly treated I've been you will say, 
By a 
cook who was called Sarah Jane, 
Sarah Jane was her name ; 
But I 
hope I'll ne'er see her again, 
Rootle-turn, tootle-turn tay.

Tho' I 
vowed that I 
never would leave her, 
She turned out a 
cruel deceiver. 
Rootle-turn, tootle-turn, tootle-turn, 
Bootle-tum, tootle-turn tay. 
Now I 
met his cook first in the park, 
Central Park, just near dark; 
And I 
ventured to make a 
remark 
That it was a 
very cool day; 
She answered me not at all bold, 
That it was very cold; 
Her name and address she then told, 
Bootle-tum, tootle-turn tay. 
Tho' I 
vowed, etc. 
Sarah Jane was a 
frisky young maid, 
And good wages was paid. 
And at the fine house where she staid

But one evening she drove me quite mad, 
Yes, quite mad, 'twas too bad, 
A 
Dutch barber beside her she had, 
Rootle-tum, tootle-turn tay. 
Tho' I 
vowed, etc. 
" 
Mister Dutchman," says I, " this looks queer, 
Swilling here, lager bier; 
But you ain't got no biz'ness down here, 
So listen to what I 
now say: 
If I 
catch you here again, forsooth, 
It's the truth, though uncouth, 
I 
will darken your eyes, my sweet youth!"

Though I 
vowed, etc. 
"Now," said he, " vy to you interfere,

Now, then, Miss, your affections I'll test— 
Do not jest, I

And the barber she vowed she loved best.

I

I'M A 
LADIES' MAN. 
As Sung by CHRISTY'S Minstrels. 
TELE ladies—bless their hearts !—whenever I 
pass their 
gaze, 
Bestow on me sweet epithets of fond, admiring praise. 
Their favor would spoil some, but me it never can— 
For Cupid is the bosom friend of every ladies' man. 
Whenever I 
promenade, I 
always dress so gay, 
I'm obliged to take a 
cane with me to keep the girls 
away; 
They can't resist my style—now do you think they can ? 
There's something fascinating—quite—about a 
ladies' 
man. 
With politics and art I 
never bore my brains ; 
Although I 
pass these subjects by, the ladies don't 
complain. 
With gossip to be stored, I 
find the better plan— 
It doesn't want intelligence to be a 
lathes' man. 
Sometimes I 
find I'm snubbed by vulgar, jealous men, 
Because to one flame they may have, I can at leas' 
boast ten. 
To never be " put down" I 
find the wiser plan— 
It wants a 
deal of impudence to be a 
ladies' man.

rim sing to you a 
funny song, 
And promise not to detain you long; 
I'll tell you of the funny sight, 
On the Central Park of a 
Sunday night. 
What crowds of people, I 
declare! 
CENTRO' JURIC ON A SUNDAY NIGHT. 
45 
From fives to tens are walking there; 
All other grounds are deserted quite, 
For Centrol Park, of a 
Sunday night. 
Chorus. 
If you doubt the truth of what I 
say, 
And wish to prove it anyway, 
Go yourselves and take a 
sight. 
Of Central Park of a 
Sunday night.. 
You'll find old bachelors strutting away, 
Chatting and talking with maidens gay; 
And old maidens there you'll find, 
With little poodle dogs behind. 
Patrick and Bridget will be there, 
Rambling in the evening air; 
A-strutting around with great delight, 
On the Central Park of a 
Sunday night. 
If you doubt, etc 
Youn.g maidens, tired of single life, 
And wishing to become a 
wife, 
Trying with many a 
cunning leer, 
To catch a 
swellish husband dear. 
And young men a-passing along, 
Singing " Out on a 
spree," or some other 
song, 
With sweethearts under their arms so tight, 
On the Central Park of a 
Sunday night. 
If you doubt, etc. 
Soft young lovers, there you'll meet, 
Dressed in their Sunday clothes so neat; 
Billing and cooing like turtle doves, , 
And calling each other dears and loves. 
And under the shadow of the trees, 
How they do each other squeeze! 
If trees could speak, tell tales they might, 
Of the Central Park of a 
Sunday night. 
If you doubt, etc. 
46 
OUT ON A srErai. 
The thing that oft me most annoys, 
Is to see so many naughty boys;- ; 
Instead of being home with their mammas, 
Running round smoking penny cigars. 
And girls scarce sixteen years old, 
Laughing and chatting with them so bold; 
And doing the thing that is not righ t, 
On the Central Park of a 
Sunday night. 
If you doubt, etc. 
OUT ON A 
SPREE. 
As sung by the CHRISTYS. 
Ant—" Paddy is the Boy." 
IP 
you will listen to me, I 
will sing of a 
spree, 
That once happened to me, and my friend Brown 
The other night after dark, we went out for a 
lark, 
To go home with the milk in the inorninc,r. 
We were first-rate old pals, looking after the gals, 
We'd not been long out, when we chanced for .to view, 
We walked up the street, when who should -
we. meet 
But two gals that looked as gay as the morning. 
Chorus. 
So mind what you're about, when you're out with your 
pals, 
Don't get larking along with the gals; 
It may happen unto you, as it did to Brown and me, 
I 
mean the other night when we went out on the spree. 
For a 
dance we were bent, to a 
ball-room we went, 
To give a 
display of the fantastic toe; 
We had the latest of dance, Prince Imperial of France, 
And we showed them a 
style for a 
warning. 
The polka was first, a 
quadrille next did follow, 
At dancing I 
tell you, we beat them all hollow; 
My partner and pal, with his other gal, 
. • 
OUT ON A SPREE. 
47 
Kept dancing all night till the morning. 
So mind what, etc. 
The ladies looked shy, and said they were dry, 
They asked us some sherry cobblers to stand; 
Me and Brown, with each lass, drank glass after glass, 
The effects of which we felt queer in the morning. 
What with dancing and drinking, and cutting a 
shine. 
Along with these ladies, we both thought divine; 
We opened our eyes, and we gazed with surprise, 
To fuid our watches had gone in the morning. 
So mind what, etc. 
The ladies were rude, a 
row there ensued, 
My gal's fancy fellow, he pitched into me; 
Another pitched into Brown, right and left about the 
Which we very soon took as a 
warning. 
A 
fellow said my gal was his niece, and he called the 
police, 
Who very soon came, and the row then did cease •, 
Ile took me and Brown, where we very soon found, 
Ourselves locked up all night 'till the morning. 
So mind what, etc. 
The judge with his hair grey, said, " Young men, you 
must pay, 
Without any dismay, for your night on the spree; 
You've been playing your larks, along with the spc.rks, 
And I 
beg you'll take this as a 
warning. 
For cutting a 
shine, I 
shall inflict a 
fine, 
The amount of ten dollars, or twenty-one days; 
Not a 
word then we spoke, we were regular broke, 
And put back in the cell till the morning. 
So mind what, etc. 
I 
sent for my wife, which caused grief and strife, 
For we had no money for to pay the fine; 
Brown's wife also came, who did us much blame, 
But received us with smiles in the morning.

RIDING DT A RAILROAD TRAIN. 
Now all you young men, take a 
warning by me, 
Stop at home with your wives, and don't get on the 
spree, 
Or it may happen to you, as it did to Brown and me, 
When we went on the spree till the morning. 
So mind what, etc. 
RIDING IN A 
RAILROAD TRAIN. 
As sung by CniusTy's Minstrels. 
Ara--" Riding in a 
Railroad Car." 
Somr. say a 
trip by rail, to please can never fail, 
To me it brings naught but pain; 
When I 
think of an event, which happened when I 
went 
Riding in a 
railroad train. 
It was going on a 
trip, for a 
salt water dip, 
To Saratoga, and back again. 
That I 
met a 
young spark, who stole away my heart, 
When riding in a 
railroad train. 
When riding in a 
railroad train, 
That I 
met a 
young spark, who stole away my heart, 
When riding in a 
railroad train. 
He was handsome, wore a 
watch, sported a 
moustache, 
Of which he appeared quite vain ; 
So very courteous do you see, he made ample room for 
me, 
By the side of him in the railroad train. 
What he whispered by the way, of course I 
need not say, 
But his eyes pierced me through again, 
And very soon he placed his arm around my waist, 
When riding in the railroad train. 
[Repeat. 
As the tunnel we drew near, I 
expressed to him my fear 
Being terribly afraid of the same; 
MARETFD ON A WEDNESDAY: 
But scarce had I 
got in, when I 
felt above my chin, 
Such a 
tickling in the railroad train'. 
When the darkness clisapeared, how strange he did ap-
pear, 
I 
looked for his moustache but in vain; 
Goodness gracious what a 
fix, they were sticking to my 
lips, 
Whilst riding in a 
railroad train! 
The passengers all smiled, as he tore them off so wild, 
And put them to his lips again; 
But the train, it quickly stopped, and in a 
conductor 
got, 
And stared at us all in the train. 
My spark blew his nose, for concealment I 
suppose, 
But the conductor said, " I 
know your little game. 
For a 
message I 
have got, by the telegraph to stop' 
Your riding in a 
railroad train." 
Why they should serve him so, just then I 
didn't know; 
They brought him back to town again; 
But on looking on the ground, lay empty purse I 
found, 
Whilst riding in a 
railroad train 
Now ladies stop at home, don't go traveling alone, 
Or you may get served the same; 
And never let a 
spark slyly kiss you in the dark, 
When riding in a 
railroad train. 
MARRIED ON A 
WEDNESDAY. 
As sung by CHRISTY'S Minstrels. 
Aix—" Hoboken is the Place to Ruralize." 
I 
ONCE knew a 
girl, a 
beauty I 
thought her, 
A 
milkman's daughter, I 
went for to court her; 
I 
made up my mind, and the ring I 
bought her, 
And I 
asked her to marry me. 
, 
She sighed and she giggled, and she said " Oh la! 
I 
should very much like, but you'd better ask pa ;" 
So it was settled that night, all right and tight, 
To get married on a 
Wednesday. 
Chorus. 
Oh Polly Pluck, she's such a 
duck, 
With Cupid's dart, my heart she struck, 
Oh, goodness gracious me, 
To get married on a 
Wednesday. 
This girl, sl,e 
was so dreadful particular, 
Oh, what a 
Ftickler, I 
once tried to tickle her; 
She caught ni a 
slap right on the auricular, 
"There's time enough for that," says she. 
I 
like her all the better, for I 
wouldn't give a 
cuss, 
A 
girl that goes a-tickling, she isn't virtuous, 
So fly away time, oh isn't it prime, 
To get married on a 
Wednesday. 
Oh Polly Pluck, etc. 
She went over the water to a 
fortune-teller there, 
Down in a 
cellar there, and spoke to a 
feller there, 
I 
knew that the feller in the cellar would tell her, 
She'd be married to a 
feller like me. 
He said that she would be my bride, 
Have fourteen babbies, but wouldn't be satisfied; 
But promised six more, oh just before, 
If we get married on a 
Wednesday. 
Oh Polly Pluck, etc. 
I 
furnished a 
house, as well as I 
was able to, 
A 
chair and a 
table too, a 
pump and a 
ladle too. 
But she made me go and buy a 
cradle too, 
To put in a 
nursery. 
Oh ain't I 
jolly proud of it, above a 
bit rather; 
Only fancy some day that I 
shall be a 
father! 
With such bliss in store, I 
shall burst before 
I 
get married on a 
Wednesday. 
Oh Polly Pluck, etc. 
'BETSY GAY. 
51 
Now single gents, take my advice, a 
bit, 
Do in a 
trice, a 
bit better go splice a 
bit; 
It's far more better, and much more nicer bit, 
Than all by yourselves to be. 
Oh won't I 
be a 
regular first-rater, 
When I 
take the babbies out in a 
perambulator! _ 
It's enough to make a 
man take any gal he can, 
To get married on a 
Wednesday. 
Oh Polly Pluck, etc. 
BETSY GAY. 
As sung by CHRISTY'S Minstrels. 
I 
LOPE a 
little oyster girl, her name is Betsy Gay, 
She doesn't love me in return, the reason why I 
say; 
Because she says I 
am a regular spoony-dandy-fancy 
sort of chap in my way. 
She 11 break my heart, I know she will, that saucy 
Betsy Gay. 
Chorus. 
Because she says I 
am a regular spoony-dandy-fancy 
sort of chap in my way; 
She'll break my heart, I know she will, that saucy 
Betsy Gay. 
We took a 
trip one day, 'twas in the winter time, 
We both put on a 
pair of skates, and didn't we slide so 
fine! 
Oh my yes, we got so far upon the ice, it broke and I 
fell in, 
They put me in a 
vapor bath, which made me twice as 
thin. 
For she says, etc. 
I 
gained her consent one night, and took her to a 
fancy 
ball, 
52 
ONE NIGHT WHILE WANDERING. 
My foot caught in her crinoline, and' both we down did 
fall; 
Oh my, what a 
Gay, she was hurt, and I 
was hurt the 
most of all, to tell, 
She left me lying on the floor, and walked, off with a 
For she say, etc. 
Next day a 
letter I 
received, it came from Betsy Gay, 
Saying, " Spooney, I've given you turnips, with another 
I've cut away." 
Oh my, didn't I 
give a 
sigh when I 
found she was de-
ceitful with another gone away. 
She's broke my heart, I 
know she has, that saucy Betsy 
Gay. 
For she says, etc. 
ONE NIGHT WHILE WANDERING. 
As sung by CHRISTY'S Minstrels. 
Ain—" Fair shines the Moon to-night." 
ONE night while wandering, this gent was pondering, 
On strange ideas squandering all over so so; 
To strains on ristoning, I 
found myself listening, 
When quite melancholy, to a 
dark gal called Molly, 
Was singing Oh Polly, won't you try me oh, 
Try me oh, try me oh, won't you try me oh. 
With big lips pouting, his love much doubting, 
She bade him go scouting, nor near her be found; 
Jealousy was larking, love for him smarking, 
In spite of his barking, he could not gain ground. 
If she had guessed rightly, he was quite sprightly, 
With other girls nightly been bobbing around, 
Around, around, been bobbing around, 
Around, around, been bobbing around. 
HOW THE MONEY GOES. 
A 
big oath he dashed in a 
big oath he smashed in, 
His best tile he mashed in, for his woes had begun; 
While she in her sleeve oh, grinned to see him grieve, 
oh, 
His buzzum did heave oh, for his woes had begun. 
Says he, " No more will I 
flatter, farewell you may 
chatter, 
I'm off like a 
hatter, to my Mary Ann. 
Mary Ann, Mary Ann, to my Mary Ann, 
Mary Ann, Mary Ann, to my Mary Ann." 
HOW THE MONEY GOES, 
As sung by CHRISTY'S Minstrels. 
Arit—" Off she Goes." 
M ONEY is your only friend, 
Be careful how your cash you spend, 
Is a 
proverb often told, 
But of late it's getting old. 
For everybody seems to waste, 
Their cash freely, to suit their taste ; 
Then complain loudly of their woes, 
And wonder where the money goes. 
Now a 
countryman as green as grass, 
Will come to town a 
week to pass; 
Resolved is he to have a 
spree, 
And the " elephant" to see. 
But before he is a 
day in town, 
He meets a man who does him " Brown ;" 
His cash is gone before he knows, 
And that's the way the money goes. 
The model clerk of manners free, 
With some fair maid keeps company; 
And being inclined to cut a 
dash, 
54 • 
HUN= DoREY. 
Upon her freely spends his cash. 
Each night he takes his charmer out, 
To a 
party, ball or rout; 
While his employer little knows, 
How mighty last the money goes. 
A 
man, he sometimes will get tight, 
And then he goes in for a 
fight; 
He tries to punch his neighbor's head, 
He can't, but his is punched instead. 
, A 
policeman takes him in his charge, 
For fear he might do harm at large; 
Next morning ten dollars for blows,. 
And that's the way the money goes. 
The ladies too, I 
must confess, 
They all seem very fond of dress; 
And notwithstanding the high price, 
They can't do without something nice. 
They fear what Mrs. Grundy'll say, 
So husband a 
small bill must pay, 
For those dear bonnets, and new clothes, 
And that's the way the money goes.

With your smiling faces round, 
'Tis then I'm hunkey dorey. 
MINKET' DOREY. 
Now when a 
man is poor', 
His relations all will shun him; 
And should he owe a

His creditors will dun him. 
But when he makes a

It's quite a 
different story; 
They all come fawning round, 
Just because he's hunkey dorey.

Now a 
barber full of airs, 
He takes to going after, 
A 
gay Fifth Avenue belle, 
A 
Wall St. broker's daughter. 
He swears he is a

Then she believes his story; 
And meets him on the sly, 
And very soon he's hunkey dorey. 
A 
fast young dry-goods clerk, 
He loves a 
maiden sightly; 
She being one of the gals, 
He goes to see her nightly. 
His wages being small, 
So from his bosses store he 
Rich presents makes his dear, 
And of course he's hunkey clomp. 
In your handsome servant maid, 
An interest you are taking; 
You drop into the room, 
When she the bed is making. 
Your wife then happens in, 
In vain you tell your story; 
She soon kicks up a 
row, saying, 
" 
I 
found you hunkey dorey."

DIAMOND RING. 
DIAMOND RING. 
As sung by CHRISTY'S Minstrels. 
I'LL sing you in my song, 
Of a 
gay young cavalier, 
Who once upon a 
time lived, 
In this town right here. 
His name was Charles Augustus, 
And divinely he could sing; 
He was clerk in a 
dry-goods store, 
And he wore a 
diamond ring. 
He wore a 
black moustache, 
His hair hung round in curls; 
Oh, he was the fellow to smash, 
The unsuspecting girls. 
He'd meet them in the street, 
Sly glances they would fling, 
At the handsome ladies' man, 
For he wore a 
diamond ring. 
To parties he would go, 
And with the ladies flirt; 
He was such a 
charming beau, 
The girls would all assert. 
Had plenty of cash on hand, 
And all that sort of thing; 
He drove a 
two-forty horse, 
And he sported a 
diamond ring. 
Now things went on quite well, 
Our hero cut a 
dash; 
Like many a 
dandy swell, 
On his employer's cash. 
But his salary was too small, 
These luxuries to bring; 
He had the run of the drawer, 
And be wore a 
diamond ring. 
Now at last suspicion rose, 
In his employer's mind, 
THE BONNY GREEN FLAG. 
That Charles Augustus's clothes, 
Were altogether too fine. 
So a 
watch was set one day, 
To stop that sort of thing; 
And our dry-goods clerk was caught, 
Coming this, with his diamond ring. 
So our dry-goods clerk was taken, 
And before a. court was tried ; 
And as his case wa.s clear, 
His guilt was not denied. 
They sent him for his health, 
To the village of Sing Sing, 
To play chequers with his nose, 
Without any diamond ring. 
THE BONNY GREEN FLAG. 
As sung by CHRISTY'S Minstrels. 
AIE—" Sprig of Shillelagh." 
THERE was glorious doings on St. Patrick's day, 
When the boys all turned out from over the way. 
With the sprig, etc. 
With their bonny green liar', and their hearts in a 
glow, 
For faith they are the'boysto make a 
big show, 
And sure such a 
sight New York ne'er had seen, 
As the sprig, etc. 
There's many around don't know what they're at, 
When they laugh, and they fun, and make game of poor 
Pat, 
With his sprig, etc. 
And there are others you know, who oft tcll a 
big lie, 
When they say that the Irish need not apply, 
But when soldiers they want, in the front Pat is seen, 
With his sprig, etc. 
There are many come here that do nothing but grieve, 
DOINGS AT WASMNGTON. 
When if they'd stopp'd at home they'd get a 
ticket of 
leave, 
Without the sprig, etc. 
There are others come here, it is well understood, 
They do it alone for their country's good; 
But for his own good Pat in this land is seen, 
With his sprig; etc. 
Here's to the bonny green flag, and long may it wave, 
With the stars and the stripes in the land of the brave, 
With the sprig, etc. 
And at no distant day, it will once more float free, 
On that dear little Island over the sea, 
When brave boys and fair girls, dancing merry will be 
seen, 
With their sprig, etc 
DOINGS AT WASHINGTON. 
As sung by Cilium's Minstrels. 
Ant—" Central Park on Sunday Night." 
K.DTD folks, one moment list to me, 
I'll tell the strange sights you may see, 
Around the White House every day, 
If there you'll pass a 
hour away. 
Long Wentworth's getting short and fat, 
And Welles, 'tis known what he is at; 
And Andy Johnson, it is said, 
Each night does sober go to bed. 
Chorus. 
Such things as these are wondrous true, 
That I 
am telling now to you • 
But 'tis the place for joy and fun, 
Any fine day at Washington. 
You'll see old Fry prepare the draft, 
You'll see old Welles on gunboats daft; 
And Charley Sumner, so they say, 
DARLING LITTLE SZE. 
59 
Making niggers lawyers every day. 
And shoddy-merchants you will meet, 
Trying the country for to beat; 
And Butler talking many a 
lie, 
Ho* to take Fort Fisher he did try. 
Such things as these, etc. 
You'll see Stanton in a 
mighty fix, 
A 
sending yarns to General Dix; 
And Seward writing all the time, 
Letters without reason or rhyme. 
With Gordon Bennett and Thurlow Weed, 
All trying the nation for to bleed; 
And you'll wish that you had power enough, 
To get the devil to carry them off. 
_ Such things as these, etc. 
And army generals you will see, 
Not at the front, but on the spree; 
Give them their pay, lig' all they want, 
Greenbacks preferred to General Grant. 
Say what you like, they are swindlers all, 
Robbery's made by great and small; 
As I 
have seen, I 
tell to you, , 
What more can a 
poor comic;'-singer do ? 
• 
Such hings as these, etc. 
Mx love she is a 
cooky, 
And don't live a 
mile from here; 
And when I 
go to senher, ' 
I 
put away the lager-bier. 
I 
take her ont on Sunday— . 
So nicely dressed, 
true ;
• 
DAELLN'G LITTLE strE. 
And all the fellows round about, 
Take notice of my Sue. 
Chorus. 
Oh dear oh, you ought to see her hair, 
Rea cheeks, and pearly teeth, the fairest of the fair. 
Oh dear oh, I 
love that girl, I 
do, 
Such a 
darling creature, is my charming little Sue. 
Her fingers, they are tapered, 
Her breast is white as snow; 
And when I 
go to see her, 
She calls me her own dear Joe. 
The other night I 
went with her, 
For to fetch the lager-bier; 
I 
saw some fellow wink at her, 
Which made me feel so queer. 
Oh dear oh, etc. 
She wears a 
jocky hat, 
Trimmed with flowers, oh dear I 
Which seemed to say, Gents, through 
My heart there is no thoroughfare. 
And she wears a 
large crinoline, 
As big as old St. Paul's; 
And for to shade her pretty face, 
One of those handsome falls. 
Oh dear oh, etc. 
She wears balmoral boots, 
So stylish at the heel; 
And when I 
take her for a 
walk, 
She looks very genteel. 
She's fond of no steel jewelry, 
But oft says with a 
grin, 
" 
Her finger, it is itching, 
For to enter the gold ring." 
Oh dear oh, etc. 
I 
now must go and meet her, 
Or else the policeman will; 
THE SONG OF SONGS. 
And if I 
was to lose her, 
Myself I'd have to kill. 
So farewell for the present, 
I'll take my leave of you; 
And when I 
come here again, 
bring my little Sue. 
Oh dear oh, etc. 
THE SONG OP SONGS. 
As sung by the CHRISTV. 
I DREAMT I dwelt in marble halls, 
With the dark gal dressed in blue; 
And didn't she seem to like it, 
When early falls the dew. 
My Jane, my Jane. my pretty Jane, 
I 
liked my lager-bier; 
Then pour out the Rhine wine, 
For I 
am a 
muleteer. 
I 
wish I 
was with Nancy, 
Far away where angels dwell; 
So early in the morning 
I 
hear the murmur of the shell. 
Come where my love lies dreaming, 
Far far away upon the sea ; 
I 
am a 
young man from the country, 
But you don't get over me. 
Come into the garden, Maud, 
Underneath the willow tree! 
In such a 
moment I'll but ask, 
That you'll remember me. 
Let me like a 
soldier fall, 
In a 
garret near the sky; 
Troubadour enchanting, 
Beef, pork, mutton will you buy? 
SALLY SLY. 
In this arm-chair, my father sat, 
With Nan of Battersea; 
He said my own, my guiding star, 
We'll get married on nextWednesday. 
The boy of the Bowery goes 
The whole hog or none '•  
And so does Isabella with her gingham um-
beralla, 
Who lived at Weehawken. 
'Twas rank and fame that tempted me 
To be a 
young recruit; 
When Nelly Bly did leave me, • 
For the shepherd with his lute. 
Then take this cup of sparkling wine, 
There is some one knocking at the door. 
If you'll lull this tempest of the heart, 
I'll ask for nothing more. 
SALLY SLY. 
As sung by CHRISTI'S Minstrels. 
Ant—" Minnie Clyde." 
LONG I 
have sang of sweet Nancy, 
who lived in Broadway as you know; 
But alie has given up her lodgings on the second floor 
And she has bolted with a 
fellow named Joe. 
But I 
have got another gal, her name it is Sal, 
Her sweeter sure never was seen ; 
Her eyes are so bright, as she sheds her sweet light 
Up a 
court near Bowling Green. 
Chorus. 
Oh Sally Sly, oh criminy cry, 
You have given my buzzum such a 
twister; 
If ever I 
loved a 
girl in my life, 
It's Sally Sly, Bobby Sly's sister. 
WATER CRESSES. 
63 
I 
think that her eyes are brighter than Nancy's, 
One is green and the other is black; 
And she wears a 
belt with a 
little gold buckle, 
To show off the fall on her back. 
Her voice is so sweet as she sings in the street, 
And the truth is as I 
am a 
sinner; 
Her eyes are the windows in which you can see, 
What my Sally Sly's had for her dinner. 
Oh Sally Sly, etc. 
She's been very ill, with a 
cold in her nose, 
And the rheumatism in her heels; 
Bile and lumbago in both of her toes, 
That's put the poor gal off her meals. 
But she's got cured at last by Brandreth's pills, 
And a 
tremendous big blister. 
You may have the blister, you may have the pills, 
And I'll have Boby Sly's sister. 
Oh Sally Sly, etc. 
WATER CRESSES. 
As sung by the CHRISM. 
Ain—" The Oyster Gal. ,' 
I AM a 
jolly farmer, from New Jersey I 
came,, 
To see some friends in. New York, and Johnson is my 
name; 
At a 
diary farm near Newark I 
live when I'm to home; 
And if I 
get back safe again, I 
ne'er again will roam. 
If you'll give me your attention I 
will sing without 
delay, 
Tell you how a 
buxom little damsel my affections led 
astray; 
And. she promised for to marry me upon the first of 
May, 
And she left me with a 
bunch of water cresses. 
04 
wirrat CRESSES. 
It was on the first of April when I 
arrived in town, 
And, as a 
loitering I 
wandered up and down, 
Till I 
lost myself entirely, and about me I 
did stare, 
I 
found I 
was in a 
little street near by Chatham Square. 
A neatly-dressed young female came passing by that 
way, 
And as I 
remember her I 
shall ne'er forget the day; 
For she promised for to marry me upon the first of 
May, 
And she left me with a 
bunch of water cresses. 
I 
politely addressed her in a 
gentle way, 
" 
I 
wish to go to Grand Street, will you direct the way?" 
" 
Oh yes sir, oh yes sir," she speedily replied, 
" 
Take the turning to the left, and go down the other 
side." 
Her voice it was the sweetest I 
ever yat did hear, 
In her hands so plump and rosy, I 
noticed very clear, 
She had a 
bunch of early onions, a 
pitcher with lager-
bier, 
Some pickles and a 
bunch of water cresses. 
So I 
kindly thanked her, still walking by her side, 
Thinking she would suit me as a 
dairy farmer's bride; 
I 
summoned resolution, and asked her if she'd wed; 
To introduce the subject, why thus to her I 
said; 
"I've a 
farm of forty acres, some horses, cows and 
geese, 
Likewise a 
dairy full of butter-milk and cheese, 
Will you come with me, and mistress be, fair lady, of all 
these, 
And live upon love and water cresses?" 
She blushed, and she said, " Dear sir, if you choose, 
You are so very generous I 
cannot well refuse. 
If you'll give me your address, I 
will, without delay, 
Prepare for matrimony, and the happy day. 
I've a 
wedding dress to buy, and some little bills to pay." 
I 
handed her some greenbacks, her expenses to defray, 
STRIKING LEM. 
65 
And she promised for to marry me upon the first of 
May, 
And she left me with a 
bunch of water cresses. 
Next day a 
letter I 
received, and read there with sur-
prise, 
Dear sir, for disappointing you I 
must apologize; 
Next time you ask a 
female, into partnership for life, 
Be sure she is a 
maiden, or a 
widow, not a 
wife. 
I 
have husband of my own, and his name is Billy Grey, 
And when I 
can afford it, the money I 
will pay; 
But to think that I 
should marry you upon the first of 
May, 
You must have been as green as water cresses." 
STRIKING ILE, 
As sung by CunisTy's Minstrels. 
THE world revolves on its own axle-tree, 
Once in twenty-four hours, says G. 0. Graffee; 
The axle got hot, and the world stopt awhile, 
And the people have all gone to " boring for ile." 
Chorus. 
Never strike ile, 
Never strike ile ; 
People get looney, run mad for a 
while, 
They'll bore through to China, before they strike ile. 
There's lawyers and doctors, and men of all grades, 
Men that live by their wits, and men that have trades; 
Through old Pennsylvania they've trudged many a 
mile, 
With their forty-foot auger, they're going to " strike ile." 
Never strike ile, etc. 
The bulls and the bears of Wall Street, I 
am told, 
Like true cats and dogs, they fight over their gold;

THE CHARM-RIG YOUNG WIDOW 
When a 
greenback's a 
dollar, the poor man can smile, 
At a 
hundred per cent., he cap never " strike ile." 
Never strike ile, etc. 
Maximilian in Mexico has a 
hard time, 
His pockets are empty, he's not worth a 
dime 
There's no blood in turnips, he'll not make a 
pile, 
If he lives till he dies, he'll never " strike ile.' 
Never strike ile, etc. 
John Bull in his dotage, has smelt a 
big rat, 
He'd rather meet Satan, than one democrat; 
There's a 
doctrine called mongrel will stir up his bile, 
He may run the blockade, but he never'll 
strike ile." 
Never strike ile, etc. 
Napoleon the little, has lately grown thin, 
He's troubled with nightmare, and takes Dr. Gin; 
We've a 
small bill against him, Abe's got it on file, 
Then to balance his ledger, he'll have to " strike ile" 
Never strike ile, eta, 
Jeff Davis in Richmond, didn't get along well, 
"His Southern Confederacy was naught but a 
shell!" 
Let him brag and eat fire in true Southern style, 
He may dig his last ditch, but he'll never " strike ile." 
Never strike ile, etc. 
TFCC CHARMING YOUNG WIDOW I 
MET IN THE TRAIN, 
As Sung by CHRISTY'S Minstrels. 
Ant—" Jennie Jones." 
I 
LIVE in New Jersey, and one morning last summer, 
A 
letter informed me my uncle was dead; 
Also requesting I'd come on to New York, 
For he'd left me a 
large sum of money, it said. 
Of course I 
determined on making the journey,. 
And booked by the first train I 
found was bent; 
I MET IN THE TRAM 
67 
But if I'd stopped for the next, I'd never encountered, 
The charming young widow I 
met in the train. 
An infant she had, so fondly caressing, 
I 
ventured to ask her if that was her own. 
She answered in tears, appearing distressing, 
"Yes, and its papa is dead and gone." 
When the question I 
asked her, she in my face looking_ 
That look I 
should ne'er be forgetting again— 
In fact my heart to herself she was booking, 
Was the charming young widow I 
met in the train. 
As the train it was stoppin' the locomotive to water, 
She asked in a 
hurry, would I 
be so kind, 
The infant to take it, the darling so quiet! 
Of course I 
said that I 
didn't mind. 
To the refreshment room she went into, 
The signal for starting I 
heard, but in vain, 
Not a 
glimpse could I 
see of her, the train started with-
out 
This charming young widow I 
met in the train. 
Now loud I 
was shouting, the train to be stopping, 
And out of the window putting my head; 
No answer receiving, the child then I 
took it, 
Discovered, oh horror! that it was dead! 
n 
its bosom was sewn a 
note, which on reading, 
I 
found I 
was taken in, done for quite plain; 
It begged me bury the child for the sake of 
This charming young widow I 
met in the train. 
It was strange to me, for I 
was remarking, 
1.1Qw quiet a 
child, not hearing a 
sound; 
The infant fast asleep was, she told me, 
And quite dead asleep, in truth so I 
found. 
I 
took it, and buried the poor little creature; 
Its age or its name, I 
could not explain; 
On a 
stone was inscribed, " Underneath is bequeathed 
me, 
What the charming young widow left me in the train."

I 
SPY YOUR Liriwrl GAM:N. 
I 
SPY YOUR LITTLE GAME. 
As sung by CHRISTY'S Minstrels. 
Are—" Does your Mother know You're out ?" 
I'VE something now to tell you, 
And you'll own that it is true; 
We meet so many kinds of men, 
We scarce know who is who. 
Then if a 
kind advice I 
give, 
I 
think I'm not to blame; 
Whoever you meet be sure at first, 
To see their little game. 
Fol de rol, etc. 
The other day I 
met a 
man, 
His name, he said, was Brown; 
Says he, " As you're a 
stranger, 
I'll show you round the town. 
Of course you'll stand expenses, 
And next week I'll do the same ;" 
Says I, " Excuse me, Mr. B. 
I 
spy your little game." 
Fol de rol, etc. 
While at the races lately, 
Around I 
chanced to stray; 
A 
man at three card monte, 
Was shuffling away. 
Says he, " I'll bet you fifty, 
The next card you can't name ;" 
Says I, " I'm not quite green enough, 
I 
spy your little game." 
Fol de rol, etc. 
The other day, going down Broadway, 
At a 
faro bank I 
stopped; 
Where on the black and red cards, 
The men their dollars popped. 
Says one to me, I'll bet a 
V, 
Now you just do the same ;" 
A DOLEFUL BALLAD. 
69 
Says I, " My friend, excuse me, 
But I 
spy your little, game.' 
Fol de rol, etc. 
A 
widow lady close by here, 
One day I 
went to see; 
But soon I 
found that although old, 
A 
trap she'd set for me. 
She sighed " Oh dear, you know that, 
Living single is a 
shame ;" 
Says I, " It may be, madam, 
But I 
spy your little game." 
Fol de rol, etc. 
The other night while walking out, 
A 
gal I 
chanced to meet; 
She asked me for to see her home, 
She lived in Hester Street. 
Says she, " Now won't you stop awhile, 
For others do the same !" 
" 
No ;" says I, " my gay young damsel, 
I 
spy your little game." 
Fol de rol, etc,

THE PERAMBULATOR. 
As sung by CHRISTY'S Minstrels. 
I'vE fallen in love with a 
pretty young girl, 
My wife I 
think I'll make her; 
I 
met her first at Central Park, 
As she drove a 
perambulator. 
Such pretty feet, for I 
watched her heels, 
As I 
came up behind her! 
There may be a 
fairer in the land, 
But I 
don't know where you'll find her. 
Chorus. 
For she's just about the age, 
And she's all the rage, 
Is my Matilda Baker. 
She looks so fair, 
With her yellow curly hair, 
And she drives a 
perambulator. 
Her perambulator looks so fine, 
With blue and dark brown paint, oh! 
Pick'd and with pink and yellow stripes, 
THE PERAMBULATOR. 
And lined with bright magenta. 
Two babes inside, so fat and plump, 
Like cupids they are thriving; 
And she looks like the guardian angel, 
As she up the hill goes driving. 
For she's just about, etc. 
I 
introduced myself as soon, 
As I 
could overtake her ; 
By saying, " My dear will you let me push 
Your handsome perambulator ?" 
" 
Yes, certainly," she spoke so nice, 
And chatted on so gaily; 
Oh, don't I 
love that handsome girl, 
And so I 
meet her daily. 
For she's just about, etc. 
You should see her blush so very neat, 
Her cheeks like roses flushing; 
And gaily trots on by my side, 
While I 
does all the pushing. 
She's told me all about her friends, 
Such kindness she has shown me; 
And she's promised me her photograph, 
I'm sure that girl's sweet on me. 
For she's just about, etc. 
To the dancing-rooms around the town, 
On Saturday nights I 
take her ; 
And there's not another pair can cut a 
shuffle 
there 
Like me and Matilda Baker. 
Sometimes we to the music halls go, 
Sometimes to the Casino ; 
And as soon as I've saved enough coin, 
I 
mean to make her mine, oh. 
For she's just about, etc.
