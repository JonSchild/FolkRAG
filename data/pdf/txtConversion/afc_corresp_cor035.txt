[Letter from Harold Spivacke to Carita Doggett Corse,
September 21, 1939]
September 21, 1939
Dr. Carita Doggett Corse State Supervisor Statewide Writers' Project Federal Works
Agency, W.P.A. 40 West Duval Street Jacksonville, Florida
Dear Dr. Corse:
Thank you for sending me a copy of your official request. Until this is taken care of, you
may rest assured that I shall do everything in my power to prevent any interruption in your
work.
I do not understand exactly what arrangement you made with Professor Morris with regard
to the blanks of the University of Florida. As you know, we want the originals of all the
records in the Archive here and therefore we would like to know what indebtedness, if any,
has been incurred.
Sincerely yours, Harold Spivacke Chief, Division of Music
