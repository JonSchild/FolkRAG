Composed and written by W. H. 
DELEHANTY. 
Milk and honey, Oh! its funny— 
I 
cannot keep ,from dancing; 
For I 
love a 
girl—she's a 
pretty pearl— 
A 
lovely belle supreme— 
She's a 
lolly- pop—sweet forget-me-not— 
And her voice is so entrancing, 
She's my honeycomb, she's my sugar- plum, 
She's strawberries and cream. 
Yes, she's a 
basket full of fruit, 
She's my pretty love, she's rriy turtle dove. 
Her voice is like the music of a 
flute, 
And she's just sweet sixteen. 
CHORUS. 
Milk, honey, strawberries and cream (
spit.), 
Like the music of a 
happy dream (
spit.). 
She's a 
darling! she's a 
daisy, 
She's a 
lovely plate of peaches, 
She's a 
dandy—'lasses candy— 
She's strawberries and cream. 
Repeat Chorus. 
I'm enraptured, I 
am captured, 
By a 
lovely lump of sweetness. 
She's an oyster pie, she's a 
chicken pie, 
And she haunts my every dream. 
She's a 
little maid, she's a 
lemonade, 
And the pink of perfect neatness. 
She's a 
box of dates, she's a 
bunch of grapes, 
She's strawberries and cream. 
Oh! yes, she's far too sweet to live, 
Is this lolly pop, is this candy shop, 
And her loss I 
know that I 
would grieve— 
ZiWeet vision of my dream,

am fond of eourting, also of sporting. 
I 
often go courting the girl I 
adore : 
lIer hair she does crimple. her cheek has a

Her nose has a 
pimple five days out of four ; 
I 
ler first name is Mary, her last name is Cary ; 
She never gets airy, the dear little sprite;

Have you seen Mary, light as a 
fairy'? 
Never contrary, sings like a 
canary, 
Front old Tipperary, she works in a 
dairy, 
And never gets weary, my sweet Mary Ann. 
Her voice is soprano, she plays the piano; 
The •• Star Spangled Banner 
is the song she sings; 
I 
ler style would al eftZe ye, and set ye all crazy. 
With the songs of this daisy the neighborhood rings; 
Her appearance is dashing, she dresses in fashion, 
She's the darling 
for mashing the boys ev'rywhere ; 
'We're soon to 1.,0 married, too long we have tarried; 
Four years she has carried a 
lock of my hair.

THE OLD LOG CABIN ON THE HILL. 
Written by FRANK DUMONT, and sung by HARRY Woonsox 
with great success at Tony Pastor's. 
Far away in the South, among the cotton fields, 
Is the place I ever long to see, 
Oh! the dear sunny clime where I was bred and born, 
And the memory is ever dear to me; 
Oh! the mocking bird's singing in the trees close by, 
While far from the spot I now roam, 
In this wide, weary world wherever I may go, 
There is no place like the dear old home. 
CHORUS. 
Then give me a home in the dear old South, 
For fondly I 
love it still ; 
Then I sigh night and day, I long to see again 
Is that old log cabin on the hill. 
Oh I the ones I 
love is sleeping in the ground, 
When I am passing so fast away, 
And my heart grows so sad I long to return, 
Oh ! the old man ain't what he used to be; 
And the magnolias bloom around the cabin door, 
'Tis then I turn with a sigh, 
Oh ! I 
will go back again, back to them cotton fields, 
In that old cabin home there let me die. 
Then give me, etc.

The theatre was full, it was Dorkins' night— 
That is, Dorkins was going to play, 
A 
character new to himself and the stage 
That he'd trod for so many a 
day. 
By eight the theatre was perfectly jammed, 
All awaited a 
pleasant surprise, 
For they knew they would laugh till their sides would ache, 
And they longed for the curtain to rise. 
The play soon began, each neck was stretched forth, 
And eagerly watched each eye 
For Dorkins to make his first entrance, and then 
To give him a 
cheerful Hi, Hi! 
He soon appeared amidst loud applause, 
But something was wrong you could see : 
Why Dorkins is playing quite badly to- night, 
The people said sitting around me. 
A 
hiss? yes, it was 7 
I saw Dorkins start, 
As though stung by a 
serpent's fang. 
Then he cast a 
beseeching look all around, 
And his head on his breast did hang. 
Some said he was drunk, and I 
thought so myself, 
For to me it was awful at times. 
To see how he'd struggle along with his part, 
And continually stick in his lines. 
At last he the footlights then slowly approached, 
And ladies and gentlemen said, 
Believe me, if I 
cannot please you to- night, 
The faults not the heart but the head; 
Many a 
time I 
made you all laugh, 
When I 
was scarce able to stand, 
And every effort was pain to me then, 
Yes, if I'd raise but my hand. 
You hiss me to- night, and say that I'm drunk; 
From his breast came a 
sob and a 
moan, 
When I 
tell you the reason, I 
know you won't laugh, 
I've a 
little one dying at home. 
THE BOYS FOR ME. , 
Sung by EVA BENNETT. 
Written by George Cooper. 
Music 
by G. Operti. 
My name is Clementina Araminta Saucy Jane, 
If not exactly pretty, I 
am certainly not plain; 
I 
hate all bashful, shy young girls, admire a 
dashing man, 
And flirt with all, but I 
intend to marry if I 
can. 
The dashing, flirting, jolly swell, who's always gay and free, 
You, perhaps, may think me rather quick, but he's the boy for 
me; 
Dashing swells, jolly swells, romping swells are the boys for 
me, 
Dashing swells, jolly swells, romping swells are the boys for 
Inc. 
I 
love to promenade Broadway and see the funny sights, 
To mash the chaps who wink at me is one of my delights; 
I 
dote upon a 
fine mustache, it may be wrong, you see, 
But if the wearer, if he's nice, is just the boy for me. 
The dashing, & e. 
I'd like to capture, if I 
could, a 
chap to suit my mind, 
He must be handsome, got the stamps, and always good and 
kind, 
So if there's any out of rdi, the faces here I 
see, 
Who'd like to take me as I 
stand? 
Oh, he's the boy for me. 
The dashing. &c.

SHE'S ALL THE HEART COULD FANCY, 
WHISPER YOU'LL BE MINE, LOVE, 
SONG AND DANCE. 
'Twas going to the Central Park, 
To take the country air, 
And see the fishes and the swans, 
And other sights so rare, 
I 
met a 
pair of roguish eyes, 
That pierced me through and through, 
And made me feel so very queer, 
I 
scarce knew what to do. 
CHORUS. 
She was all the heart could fancy, 
And lovely as a 
queen, 
And just about the gayest of the gay ; 
And it was her pair of roguish eyes, 
That pierced me thro' and thro' and thro' 
And charmed my heart and senses all away. 
(Dance.) 
Her dress was made in the latest style, 
And trimmed with charming taste, 
She wore a 
brilliant necklace, too, 
Of diamonds—made of paste; 
Her golden hair in ringlets fell, 
Around her lovely neck, 
And since her charming face I've seen, 
My heart's a 
perfect wreck. 
As sung by CIIAS. DIAMOND, 
For sale at the office of The _Dramatic and -1Iasical Mirror, 1.\:o. 
10 Union Square. 
Whisper you'll be mine, love; tell me you'll be true; 
Why should I 
repine, love, loving as I 
do? 
Promise not to doubt me, trust your heart with me; 
Life were sad without thee, lonely I 
should be. 
Days to me are lonely when thy smilnQ I 
miss; 
No one but thou only fills my heart with bliss.

Sweetly beaming, softly streaming— 
Blue eyes, golden hair ;

Through the mazy dance ; 
Half exposing, and half hiding, 
Charms that all entrance.

Merry, laughing Cherry N'orine, 
Sweetest darling Cherry Norine ; 
Blue eyed beauty, sweetly dreaming, 
Golden hair so softly streaming, 
My heart's enchained with love. 
Form of fairy, winsome, airy, 
Movements of a 
sprite; 
Brighter gem than decks the starry 
Diadem of night; 
Rose tints wreathing, perfume breathing, 
Cheeks and ruby lips; 
Chains of love unconscious weaving, 
Where'er her footstep trips. 
Merry, laughih.;, Lc 
What the measure ? Gods would treasr.r,2 
Such transcendent bliss; 
Oh ! the deep, enchanting pleasure_

Brightens all one's days.

A man may be quite handsome and not be fascinating— 
It's in my style and winning ways, I'm so insinuating; 
Of course I'm sometimes sneered at, by the stupid, calm

But to my reputation that's in no way deleterious. 
Fine Fellow, &c. 
L's pleasing to a

In the Central Park, the other day, 
I 
met my charmer fair, 
Her pretty face and beaming smiles--
And she had such lovely hair— 
While from beneath her jockey hat 
Those curly tresses fell ; 
And when I 
smiled she blushed, and look'd 
Like the roses in the dell. 
CHORUS. 
And it's Oh, My ! she looked divine. (Sym) 
How I 
wished that she was mine. 
She's the fairest little flower I've ever seen; 
In the Park she is the Belle! 
Whene'er we meet, her blush is just 
Like the roses in the dell. 
We sat awhile beneath the tree, 
The time flew swiftly by; 
She said she felt so happy then, 
But could not tell me why ; 
I 
asked her, then, if she'd be mine r 
Into my RTITIR she fell, 
And answered " Yes !" and crimson blushed,

VIOLETS DIPPED IN DEW 
Words and Music by W. H. DELErwiTri, 
As I 
strolled out one evening, 
The Sun had just gone dowh, 
While leisurely meandering 
A 
little way from town ; 
I 
there beheld a 
damsel 
With eyes the brightest bins, 
Beneath her dark eye-lashes, 
Like Violets dipped in dew. 
CHORUS. 
A 
smile was all she gave me, 
But how it did enslave me, 
'Twas love, the first I 
knew ; 
There's some sweet charm entrancing 
Within her eyes so blue, 
A 
dreamy, soft expression, 
Like Violets dipped in dew. 
I 
followed on behind her. 
I 
think she knew it well, 
And as a 
sweet reminder, 
Her handkerchief it fell; 
I 
raised the scented linen 
From off the grassy ground; 
Her name, in letters crimson,

CHORUS. 
She deigned to smile upon me, (Symph.) 
That moment she had won me, 
My heart it pierced me through ; 
There's some sweet charm entrancing, 
Within her eyes so blue; 
A 
dreamy soft expression, 
Like Violets dipped in dew. 
At length I 
did approach her, 
And ventured into talk, 
By asking her permission 
To join her lonely walk; 
She blushing, frowning, smiling, 
Said, " Oh ! I 
think you're rude ;" 
But those blue eyes, beguiling, 
Seemed to say, I 
wish you would. 
CHORUS. 
So arm in arm we wandered, ( Symph.) 
'-es, side by side meandered, 
And told our love tales too. 
There's some sweet charm entrancing, 
Within her eyes so blue, 
A 
dreamy, soft expression, 
Like Violets dipped in dew.

THERE is a 
girl not far from here, 
Who stole my heart away; 
Her eyes are bright as stars at night, 
So lively and so gay. 
We met 'twas in a 
woodland dell, 
Where berries sweet do grow; 
'Twas there we plighted both our loves, 
And I 
named her my June Rose. 
CHORUS. 
For she's just as pretty as a 
bouquet of flowers, 
That in the garden grows; 
And she has promised to be mine, 
My lovely sweet June Rose. 
We 
often meet each pleasant eve, 
And wander through the grove; 
And while the moon is beaming bright, 
We whisper then our love. 
Until the parting hour comes, 
Then from her I 
must go; 
But when she's mine no more I'll part 
From my lovely sweet June Rose. 
For she's as, Ize.

I

Whene'er they awake, my fond heart, in its dread,

While Angels are watching them ; slumber is best.

Lull them to rest! lull them to rest! 
Lull them to rest! lull them to rest! 
They say there is plenty and peace in the land, 
And that charity gives with a 
lavishing hand; 
Notwithstanding that church spires point to the skies,

Good evening to you. one and all, good evening, 
We're glad to see your smiling faces here, 
We've just arrived from Alabama this morning, 
To sing and dance, and make ourselves feel quer; 
We also come to tell you of a 
pleasure, 
Which both of us two niggers think is grand, 
And that is on a 
starry moonlight evening, 
The fun you have while tumbling on the sands.

It's a 
pleasure that we colored folks delight in, 
A 
better one you never can demand; 
It makes you lively as the lightning, 
The fun you have while tumbling on the sands. 
We now thank you for your kind attention, 
And ask you all to come some day, 
We'll try our best to gain your approbation, 
In the acrobatic biz we do display; 
Before we go, we want you to remember 
There's nothing half so nice in all the land, 
For a 
jolly time to exercise your muscles, 
As the fun you have while tumbling on the sand. 
It's a

Watching the shadows 
That dance on the meadows, 
When the day begins to fade; 
When a 
sweet remembrance comes to me 
Like a 
long forgotten strain 
Of music, awaking 
And freshly breaking 
Over my heart again. 
In visions of the past, 
I 
see my love arise, 
And in my dreaming 
I 
feel the beaming

CRUEL DAYS BEFORE THE WAR. 
Written by .TEninv KENNEY, and sung by HARRY WOODsON, at 
Harrigan & Hart's Theatre, N. Y. 
Oh, listen to the words 
Of a 
poor old colored man, 
Whose heart am filled with misery and wee; 
And a 
story I 
will tell, 
That you all do know full well, 
Of them cruel, cruel days of long ago. 
In dear old Tennessee, 
I 
lived so happily, 
The thoughts do make my old heart feel sore; 
When I 
think of days gone by, 
The tears come to my eyes, 
Them tyrannizing days before the war. 
CHORUS. 
Them cruel days am gone, 
Let us pray both night and morn, 
That they again may never come no more; 
In my memory it am new, 
The sufferings we went through, 
In them tyrannizing days before the war. 
I 
remember wel!, I 
know, 
It am very long ago, 
When I 
used to sit around my cabin home; 
With my children around my knee, 
'
44 
41 
They would play so merrily, 
Until that woeful bitter day did come. 
The white man came one day, 
Took my little ones away, 
Ohl can it be I'll never see them any more ? 
It's taken then were we, 
And sold into slavery, 
In thoso tyrannizing days before the war. 
Them cruel days, etc. 
My companions are no more, 
They have gone unto that shore, 
And their journey through this life now am done; 
They will find that all am love, 
In that happy land above, 
In that bright and blessed peaceful happy homo. 
But always we will pray— 
Yes, every night and day, 
That them cruel times may come no more; 
For our sufferings they were great. 
How terrible our fate, 
In those tyrannizing days before the war. 
Them cruel days, etc,

Grandpa's chair is vacant, 
Near the fire in the grate; 
Where he told his tales of boyhood, 
Kept the little ones awake. 
One eve, so worn and weary, 
Sleeping on his knee they lay, 
Death called that night, like the Are bright, 
Grandpa passed away. 
CHORUS. 
So let the room be cheerful, 
Place the old arm chair 
Where we talked to Grandpa, 
With his silvery snow white hair. 
How he'd watch the falling ashes, 
And sadly meditate, 
Gently sigh, we all must die, 
Like the fire in the grate. 
One bitter night in winter, 
The snow fell fast and wild; 
A 
girl looked in the window, 
A 
careworn, hapless child; 
Then Grandpa whispered " baby," 
And toddled to the gate, 
To save from sin, he brought her in, 
Near the fire in the grate. 
So let the room, eta 
Keep the fire burning, 
'Tis charity's bright flame; 
Reminding of the evening 
The orphan Mary came, 
So ragged, cold and hungry, 
With Grandpa from the gate; 
For him she kneels, a 
prayer she yields, 
Near the fire in the grate. 
So let the room, 
to.

OH there's many faces here to-night, 
how well I

But if I

Then I'll apologize—but as 
You seem to know me, 
And so many smiles I

But if you want to learn to dance, 
Just telegraph to me.

Oh I'm always here in time, [ Break.;

To which you must all agree, 
But if you want to learn this step, 
Just telegraph to me. 
To amuse you all I'm here to-night, 
To sing and dance for you, 
And as you seem to like it then, 
Up goes this big shoe;

But if you want to learn

I 
took my girl one day, 
A sailing down the bay, 
And Emma was the darling creature's name; 
While standing on the pier, 
Some chaps at her did stare, 
And one and all around her did exclaim:

Ohl Emma, whoa! Emma, 
Emma, you put me in quite a 
dilemma; 
Ohl Emma, whoa! Emma, 
That's what I 
hear wherever I 
go. 
I 
asked them what they meant, 
When some one at me sent 
An egg, which nearly struck me in the eye 
Emma began to scream, 
" 
Oh! Fred, what does this mean?" 
I 
asked again, and this was their reply: 
Oh! Emma, etc. 
I 
thought they'd never cease, 
So shouted out " Police!" 
And when he came he looked at me so sly; 
The crowd then at me laughed, 
And said I 
must be " daft," 
And once again they all commenced to cry: 
Oh 1 
Emma, eto 
An old man said to me, 
" 
Why, young man can't you see 
The joke!" and I 
look'd at him with surprise

saying's got about; 
And then their voices seem'd to rend the skies!

I 
KNOW SHE LOVES ME. 
SONG AND DANCE. 
Sung by T. 
M. HENGLER. 
I 
know a 
little maiden, fair and young, 
The sweetest little creature in the village, 
Her face is like a 
garden of flowers, new sprung, 
And she lives within a 
rustic little cottage. 
There may be maidens just as fair, 
With the same bright winning ways ; 
But none with eyes so lovely, 
Such a 
sweet bewitching gaze. 
Oh, yes, she is a 
beauty, so loving kind and [rue, 
And the only girl to suit me. 
With her laughing eyes of blue. 
That's why I'm always happy, light and gay, 
Because, you see my heart with love is laden ; 
Cupid came and drove dull care away, 
The day I 
met this pretty little maiden. 
I 
know she loves me dearly, (syruph.) 
Her actions prove it clearly. ( .‘ ) 
CHORUS. 
That's why I'm always happy, light and gay, 
Because, you see, my heart with love is laden ; 
Cupid came and drove dull care away 
The day I

• 
One day, while we were walking side by side, 
I 
never shall forget the look she gave me ; 
' 
lwas when I 
asked her would she be ray bride ? 
She smiling said, of course. if you will hare me, 
Then threw her arms around my neck— 
Which I 
took not amiss, and in that happy moment, 
You might have heard a 
kiss. 
Oh yes, she loves me dearly, and I 
love her the same 
While her actions prove it clearly 
That she'd like to change her name. 
So there will be a 
wedding some fine clay, 
And you will hear the merry bells a 
ringing ; 
We'll live out in the country in grand array, 
In a 
flow of joy we'll dwell—to birds a 
singing. 
I 
know she loves me dearly, (symph) 
Her actions prove it clearly, ( " ) 
That's why I'm always happy, & c.

What a 
pleasure there is in dancing the sunlight, 
When all earth seems to smile; 
It makes a

You have no care or guile. '

We while the hours away; 
With beaming smile our time beguile,

For it will make you glad; 
In the golden rays its shadow it will mock you, 
And whirl and dance like mad. 
When sunset's come; and day is done, 
And darkness claims her right, 
We'll go to rest, and the blest, 
The rays of morning light. 
Oh I

When all earth seems to smile; 
It makes a

A BURLESQUE ON JOHN B. GOUGH'S SPEECH. 
Delivered by Gus W ILLIAMS. 
viii now make a few remarks on dernperance. 
I 
am no 
drinking man, never haying drank a 
drop of liquor in my life— 
dot T 
paid for. 
I 
am no orator, but shall try to represend dot 
gread demperance orator, John B. Gough, a 
man whorr I've of-
den been daken for. 
Should I 
possess the eloquenc, of Gen-
eral Grant, I 
could give more scope to de subject I 
am now 
aboud to wrestle mit. 
Demperance is an old und yell yorn sub:cet, but like a 
Keno 
box ve can shake it ub, und get anoder number. 
It's very bard to approach a 
man vat ain't a-drinking; you're 
apt to be met with—" Who tole you I 
vasn't drinking ?"— 
" 
You mind your business, mid I'll mind yours."—" Come und 
take a 
ball," und odor vell-known expressions used by politi-
cians. 
I 
vas called upon vonce to see voile of de hardest cases of 
demperance it has ever been my good fortune to yitness. 
A 
man, who yen drunk vos do kindest of husbands: but yen sober 
he vos a 
perfect devil. 
I 
vent to de house, a 
beautiful brown 
curb- stone front, knocked de door down, und vent in. 
De man 
vos dere. 
I 
said to him—" Viii you please give me a 
drink of 
vater?"—(de firsd dime I 
ever dook vater in my life.) 
He said, 
" 
Yes, sir; have a 
seat," pointing to a 
red-hot sdove. I 
de-
clined to sit, for various reasons. 
I 
spoke to him aboud Infla-
dion, Seven Oud, but I 
avoided de subject of demperance. 
At 
last I 
said, " you have a 
vife, I 
believe ?" 
Ile replied, " Yes, 
sir; de fifth one; red-headed." 
I 
said, " You love your vife, 
don't you ?" 
He said, " Vell, id's unnatural for a 
man to love 
his vife now-a-days." I 
said, " Don'd you dink of you vould 
sign dis paper, und go und get full vid me to-night, you could 
come home, get a 
club, und have a 
good deal of fun around de 
house ?" 
Ile said, " Yes, I 
suppose so." 
I 
said, " You'll do 
Id?" 
He said, " I 
viii." 
I 
pulled oud a 
coby of " Good-Look-
ing Snow," I 
laid id on de dable; he placed his nose in the ink-
bottle, und wrote his name. 
Just den a 
voice came from anoder room—(full of emodion 
und beer)—" Luke Gerloot I" 
De man said, " Come in mit me, 
Mr. Whooping-cough," I 
vent in dere, und his vile vos lafing 
on a 
bed, she vos dead—drunk. 
He knelt down und printed a 
kiss on her forehead in large types. 
She took his foot in her 
hand, looked up, und said, " Oh Luke is such a 
good husband 
ven he's drunk, but yen sober, he's N. G-!" ( de first time I 
ever 
knew she spoke Latin.) 
De man said, " She says I 
am good I" 
at de same time pulling down de neck of his shirt, he showed 
me a 
second-hand scar. 
I 
said, " Yore you vaccinated dere ?" 
His vife said, " I 
cannot tell a 
lie, I 
done it mit a 
little hatchet." 
Of my lips had been dry Yen I 
came in dere, I 
assure you dey 
yore vet den, for I 
alvays carry de stuff mit me. 
But dis is 
only vone case oud of dwo hundred und fordy-dree und a 
half, 
vere I 
have carried my good vork; I 
intend to carry id all over 
de cidy, so dot ven I

monumend erected to

Of dere is any bresent to-night dot vould like to help me in my

ALL THE WORLD TO ME. 
SONG AND DANCE. 
Written by ROBERT W ORDEY, of W ORDEN Sr, MACK. 
Oh I 
I 
know a 
grove of stately poplar trees, 
That whisper in the sunlight soft and low, 
And gently lend their branches to the breeze, 
And often there to meet my love I 
go; 
She greets me with a 
loving smile, 
And welcomes me with voice both low and sweet, 
We sit and talk the while, 
And count the daisies growing 'neath our feet. 
She s 
pure as heaven above, (
break: 
She's all I 
have to love, 
:break: 
I've sworn by moon and stars that I'll be true, 
Our vows were plighted 'neath the poplar trees; 
And I 
really love her dearly, 
She is all the world to me. 
And when the Summer time has passed and gone, 
And Winter spreads its mantle o'er the earth, 
And the poplar trees are bare and gaunt and wan, 
I'll marry then my pearl of priceless worth; 
For she has promised to be mine, 
And share with me her future life and love, 
I've pledged her oft in rubs wine, 
We'll live as happy as the turtle dove. 
She's pure, etc. 
IT'S NICE. 
Written expressly for!LarrLE BOB, by BEN DODGE. 
Some time ago I 
loved a 
girl, 
And very strange to say, 
Although she claimed to worship me, 
She'd a 
peculiar way 
Of acting very shy and strange, 
Whenever I 
was nigh, 
And when I 
asked the reason then, 
To me she would reply— 
CHORUS. 
It's nice, it's nice, 
Don't you think it is so? 
It's nice, it's nice, 
Now that's what I 
exclaim; 
It's nice, it's nice, 
Don't you think it is so? 
Most everybody says it is, 
Of course I 
think the same. 
We're married now, and happy live 
As two doves in a 
nest, 
And with a 
charming family 
Our union has been blest; 
We've got a 
pair of bouncing twins— 
A 
lovely girl and boy, 
Anil the pleasures of our married life 
There's nothing can annoy. 
It's nice, etc. 
Now there's my next door neighbor, who 
Is known as Deacon Brown, 
Supposed by every one to be 
The straightest man in town; 
But I 
caught him late last Sunday night, 
Doing something wrong I'm sure, 
lie was trying to kiss his servant girl 
Behind the pantry door. 
SPOKEN.—I said, " Here, here, 
Deacon, stop! 
That's 
naughty." 
But he only said, " I 
know it is, Bobby, but— 
It's nice," etc. 
Words by ROBERT W ORDEN, of W ORDEN & MACK. 
One evening in July, 
When the sunset gilt the sky, 
And the little birds were warbling 'mid the trees; 
I 
met a 
maiden fair, 
With wavy golden hair, 
Who seemed to lend a 
perfume to the breeze. 
Her eyes of dreamy blue, 
Her cheeks of brilliant hue, 
And a 
merry song she warbles all the day; 
Her name she would not tell, 
And as I 
loved her well, 
I 
christened her my Jockey Club Bouquet. 
CHORUS. 
It's true I'm deep in love, (
break) 
I'll win the girl, by Jove, (break) 
For she's promised to be mine, 
Before the Winter time, 
And don't I 
wish to see the wedding day; 
For her name she will not tell, 
And as I 
love her well, 
I've christened her my Jockey Club Bouquet. 
(Dance.' 
She is as gentle as a 
dove, 
And bashful as her love, 
And says that I'm an impudent young man ; 
And when I 
ask a 
kiss 
From this charming little miss, 
She tries to hide her face behind her fan. 
But if my wooing thrives, 
And the wedding day arrives,

LAWDY DAWDY FELLOW, 
Characteristic of a 
Lady Killer. 
Words and Music by T. M. ITENGLER. 
Copyright, 1877, A. 
J. 
FISHER, 98 Nassau Street. 
I'm a 
charmmg, captivating, fascinating fellow. 
Where ere I 
stray, the ladies say, 
Oh, isn't he a 
swell, 0'. 
They pet, and treat me tenderly, 
And call me lady killer, 
They laugh, they sigh 
As I 
pass by, 
'I'm so awfully deuced clever. 
By jingo, I'm so charming, 
And their darling. j 
CHORUS. 
I'm the ladies choice, by Jove, 
A handsome, charming swell, 0; 
By jingo, how the ladies sigh, 
For this Lawdy Dawdy Fellow. 
I'm known at Saratoga, 
Long Branch, oft' I 
visit, 
The ladies fair, at me stare, 
And say, isn't he exquisite, 
I'm lady-like in fancy, 
In form and style a 
stunner. 
In the mazy waltz, the polka too, 
They sigh to be my partner. 
I'm the ladies, et.

American Fortune-Telling Cards.—This is the old-

publiabefl it for years, and the demand is continually increasing. 
These Ce:rds are arranged and printed in series—H, arts, Clubs, Dia-
monds and Spades—and each or these into K for King. Q for Queen, 
and K 
for Knave, e,nd numbers I, 3, to 10. 
The Cards are arranged in 
four rows, and are to be read according to directions. 
Many of the an. 
ewers depend upon the position certain cards bear to other cards. The 
method of playing is somewhat complicated, but the directions have 
been made so that very little study will suffice to an ordinary under-
standing. Many professional Fortune-Tellers use these,cards, and we 
are in receipt of letters in relation to them from all parts of the U. S. 
inclosed in handsome case

Canning Cards.—This Series of Cards has been arranged 
to meet a 
want frequently felt by young people—a want of means of 
expressing one's sentiments in such a way as to be non-committaL 
Many young ladies are visited by gentlemen who are either too diffi. 
dent or too fearful of a 
repulse, to venture upon asking the momentous 
question. The lady is restrained, by custom and a 
sense of propriety, 
from doing anything that would seem to be an unladylike encourage-
ment. As a 
result of this dilemma, many lives are spent as an unloved 
tedious existence, which might have been prolonged and enjoyed in the 
happiness of matrimony. This pack of Cards will overcome the diffi-
culty, and being in the shape of questions and answers, will cover every 
phase of courtship. 
The sentiments conveyed therein need not be 
- adopted by the parties to the game as their own, unless it accords with 
tin state of their affections, which fact makes further explanation un-
necessary. The playing of these Cards is not restricted to two players, 
but may be enjoyed by evening parties  •
