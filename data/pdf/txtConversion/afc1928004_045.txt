Now just list to what I 
mention; for, to sing 'tis 
my intention 
About Dame Nature's great invention: its the 
naughty, naughty girls. 
Oh! you pretty creatures, bless you! though we 
love you and caress you. 
But it costs a 
heap to dress you: oh! you naughty 
naughty g irls ; 
In the dry-goods' places you're dropping, your ex-
penses there's no stopping: 
For, you love to go a 
shopping; oh I 
you naughty, 
naughty girls. 
There are ribbons, silks and laces, velvet Basques 
and satin dresses, 
Paint and powder for your faces: oh! you naughty, 
naughty girls. 
There's a 
Thirty-dollar bonnet, and to make the 
face become it 
You've a 
flower-garden on it: oh! you naughty, 
naughty girls. 
There are Water-falls expensive, Patent Heavers so 
dimensive, 
And a 
tilting-hoop extensive: oh! you naughty,

When to business we are making, how our anger 
you are waking, 
With your hoops the side-walks taking : oh you 
naughty, naughty girls! 
A Policeman, at the crossing, makes each driver 
hold his horses in, 
Off you go, your head a 
tossing: oh! you.naughty, 
naughty girls. 
When in crowdea cars or stages, no matter what 
our ago is, 
We've to stand while you engages all the seats, 
you naughty girls. 
When a. chap in love is getting, how you weave 
him in your netting, 
With your flirting and coquetting: 
oh! you 
naughty, naughty girls. 
He swears he'll never doubt you, vows he cannot 
live without you, 
Jealous gets, and fights about you: oh! you 
naughty, naughty girls. 
When he thinks you'll ne'er deceive him, for an-
other one you'll leave him, 
And the sack you'll coolly give him: oh! you 
naughty, naughty girls. 
How One's character you handle! for, at telling bits 
of scandal, 
There's no one can hold a 
candle with the naughty, 
naughty girls. 
All our little secrets telling, on our little foibles 
dwelling, 
All our faults and follies swelling: oh ! 
you 
naughty, naughty girls. 
Though I 
may sing about you, and others they 
may scout you, 
But what could we do without you ? oh! you, dear 
delightful girls!

Beautiful Young Mrs. Crop. 
Young Christopher Crop was a 
farmer, 
When he took it into his head 
To tall deep in love with a 
charmer, 
Who was all he could wish for, he said, 
For dumplings she made to perfection, 
Mock turtle and prime ginger pop, 
And would make, as said all his connection, 
A 
beautiful young Mrs. Crop. 
4 
Oh I 
most beautiful, &c. 
She understood singing and sowing, 
And pianofortes and ploughs, 
And Berlin wool-work and beer brewing, 
And music and milking the cows. 
She could play the guitar and cure bacon, 
In phrenology she was tip-top, 
So there was no doubt of her making 
A 
beautiful young Mrs. Crop. 
Oh! most beautiful, &c. 
For stoves she could cut out such. papers, 
As really astonished the Crops ; 
She danced, and made pickles and capers, 
And understood growing of hops. 
So, Christopher's father and mother 
Both urged him the question to pop, 
Which he did, and without any bother., 
She agreed to become Mrs. Crop. 
Oh! most beautiful, &c. 
Her wedding dress was her own making, 
'Twas figured lace, seven yards wide; 
And proudly his shoes began creaking, 
As he walk'd in the church with his bride.

And, as most lasses do in such cases, 
She blush'd,-and was ready to drop ; 
Yet the blushing but added fresh graces, 
To beautiful young Mrs. Crop. 
Oh! most beautiful, &c. 
They were married almost without knowing, 
To her it appeared like a 
dream ; 
And 'twas not till from clinch she was going, 
She found she had altered her name: 
When the bells of the villame ' gun 
As if they never intended't o 
stop ; 
And they sounded as if they were singing— 
Oh ! beautiful younp. Mrs. Cron. 
Oh I

The First Kiss. 
One fine night, as homeward hieing, 
When good folks in bed were lying, 
I 
espied the fair Li,etta 
Standing by her cottage door ; 
Softly, softly, I 
drew near her— 
llound her form the moon shone clearer— 
When her tiny hand I 
seized it, 
Anger finsled her cheek all o'er ! 
" 
Do not fear.' " Pray let me go, sir! 
You are rude, I'd have you know, sir!" 
" 
Lovely maid, one kiss deny not.

ask no more !"

Such I 
never give to man, sir."

Going Down Murray Hill. 
I 
was out promenading one lovely morn 
In the middle of July, 
Admiring all the pretty little dears 
As they went passing by, 
When I 
saw, Oh I 
such a 
dear little duck, 
Who caused this frame to thrill, 
As she swept the pave with a 
green cotton dress 
As she went down Murray hill. 
CHORUS. 
As she went down Murray Hill, 
As she went down Murray Ilill. 
Now my swells when you're out, 
Just mind what you're about 
With the girls down Murray Hill. 
As I 
pass'd by. she look'd so shy ; 
Sus I, " Miss, is your name Jones ?" 
Says she—like a 
saint—" Well, no it ain't," 
In, oh ! such lovely tones ; 
Says she with a 
wink, " It's no such thing, 
My name's Maria Till," 
And then she said she was a 
nu'ssery maid, 
To a 
house down Murray Hill.

You may come to night, and I'll make it all right 
At the house down Murray Hill. 
Oh, away down Murray Hill, &c.

was there in a

Poverty Is No Sin. 
Poor Kate with nosegay basket trim, 
Sent forth a 
plaintive cry; 
Tier varied flowers round the brim, 
She bid each traveller buy ; 
But heedless pass'd the giddy throng 
In vain she Loped to win. 
She sigh'd and held her basket low, 
Sure poverty's no sin. 
She silent g.rieves, but perseveres, 
By hunger pinched and cold ; 
A

By force he press'd this modest maid, 
Who pity wisli'd to win, 
Who strupgl'd, frowned, and blushing cry'd.

The Naughty, 
One night I 
went out and returned before time, 
And down stairs as usual did walk, 
-When arrived at the door a 
surprise great was mine 
Two voices inside were at talk. 
I 
looked through the keyhole, and what did I 
see 
A 
sight whicli bound me like a 
spell, 
My worthy employer had Nell on his knee, 
Which proves that you never can tell. 
Then I 
went to bed, but at supper next night, 
I 
questioned her as to the act, 
She said," Dearest Georgy, I 
own its not right, 
But I 
did it for von, love, in fact, • 
I 
love you most dearly, which the old man knew, 
He'd discliar,re me you know very well, 
So I 
just let him kiss me to stay here with you, 
Perhaps she did, but you never can tell. 
One morning soon after Nell dressed in her best, 
Went out as she said for a 
change,

Under a 
spreading chesnut-tree the village smithy 
stands, 
The smith a mighty man is he, with large and 
sinewy hands 
And the muscles of his brawny arms are strong as 
iron bands. 
His hair is crisp and black and long; his face is 
like the tan ; 
His brow is wet with honest sweat, he earns what-
e'er he can. 
And looks the whole world in the face, for he ow-es 
not any man. 
Week in, week out, from morn till night, you can 
bear his bellows blow 
You can hear him swing his heavy sledge, with 
measur'd beat and slow, 
Like a 
sexton ringing a 
village bell when the 
evening sun is low, 
And children coming home from school, look in at 
the open door, 
They love to see the flaming forge, and hear the 
bellows roar, 
And catch the sparks that fly like chaff from a 
thrashing floor.

Singing in the village choir, and it makes his

And with his hard rough hands he wipes a

Toiling, rejoicing, sorrowing, onward through life

Something attempted, something done has earned

Now I 
fell in love with a 
charming young gal, 
Her name was Arabella; 
The first time I 
met her, forget it I 
ne'er shall 
When I 
carried her blue silk umbrella. 
Her father a 
baker in Harlem lane lived, 
Free, open-hearted, and merry ; 
Whenever I 
called, Arabella to see, 
She said, " 'twas delightful-0

Which pleased very much Arabella;

The Naughty, 
" 
Would it rain," she asked me, wishing to know , 
Should she take her blue silk umbrella. 
"If yen wish" I 
replied, tho' a 
very fine day, 
By Dummy we started so merry ; 
We were chatting and laughing the whole of the 
way, 
She said, " ' twas delightful-0 ! very." • 
At Coney Island arrived, the palace went through, 
Then a 
trip on the water took Bella ; 
She said. " or a 
sail, suppose that we do 
Open the blue silk umbrella," 
We were sailing but slow, when of wind such a 
gust, 
Came as we were singing so merry; 
Upset the skiff, the moment when just, 
She said. "'twas delightful-0 very." 
An oar about floating, I 
luckily found, 
But alas ! of my dear Arabella; 
Not a 
glimpse could I 
see nowhere round, 
Or the blue silk umbrella. 
A 
boat from the shore to rescue soon came, 
Were dragging inc into the wherry ; 
They rolled, and they squeez'd me, to myself soon 
I 
came, 
Feeling far from delightful-0! very. 
Some drags were obtained, two boats quickly 
man 
n 'd, 
To search for my lost Arabella. 
Very shortly they found grasped tight in her 
hand 
The ill-fated blue silk umbrella. 
A 
process of squeezing and rolling went through, 
In the fIce was as red as a 
cherry ; 
Which rubbire2_,-, and brandy, soon she came too, 
Said she felt so " delightful-0! very."

Homeward returning on the same night, 
As 1 
carried the blue silk umbrella ; 
The day to be wed, was settled all right, 
Sealed with a 
kiss from Bella. 
We were married, and now of children have three, 
With faces so rosy and cherry ; 
As each one arrived, Arabella to me 
Says " this is delightful-0! very."

with heart nigh breaking : 
When one who saw her, pity taking, thus spake, 
her drooping soul to cheer; 
" 
Claim thy sorrow ! comfort borrow ! she is gone, 
who loved the well, 
Par away where angels dwell. 
Orphan lone ! thy mother's gone, far away where

She asks all who round her throng, for the way 
that she must journey : 
They say that" the voya7e is long, that the, road is 
rough and thorny."

MY MOTHER'S GENTLE WORD. 
My mother's gentle voice how oft 
It comes again to mind, 
Though years have passed since first its tones 
were in my heart enshrined ; 
When I, in childhood's careless hour, 
My friends to anger stirred, 
And only heard that kind reproach, 
My mother's gentle word. 
My mother's gentle word, it steals 
Like some sweet olden song, 
Whose melody is only heard 
To be remembered long ; 
And even now, when angry thoughts 
Within my breast are stirred. 
My soul grows calm, f,r still I 
hear 
My mother's gentle word. 
Oh! youth it is too frail a 
flower 
For passion's storm to rend, 
An unkind word the heart may break, 
But gentleness may bend ; 
Then ne'er by childhood's tender years 
Let discord's voice be heard, 
Life's sweetest mem'ry then will be 
A 
mother's gentle word.

I've bought an umbrella."

He kiss'd her out of her consent, 
That she'd become his bride ; 
To buy the ring was his intent, 
And then to buy the license, 
They parted, but he took much pains, 
Where they should meet to tell her; 
Says she, " I'll meet when next it rains, 
So bring your umbrella."

The Old C14niney Corner. 
In the dear old chimney corner let us circle round 
the fire, 
For the wind it whistles mournfully, chill falls 
the evening dew ; 
Our fire has life existenco; heap the blazing faggot 
As warm and bright it kindles, will each bosom 
kindle too. 
'Tis a 
friend, a 
gk;ad companion, thro the lonely 
winter night, 
it's creation, how delightful, to neglect it were a 
shame, 
How it blazes, how it sparkles, as it bursts from 
smoke to light, 
With life and voice it leaps, it speaks I 
feed, 
merry hearts the flame. 
In the snug old chimney corner is the oning 
burnt of home, 
The sacrifice of heart at hospitality's own shrine; 
The incense of good fellowship, we'll raise to all 
that come, 
From which as high the smoke ascends, we'll 
omens draw divine. 
Blythe the fire! what fairy visions in the cheerful 
front we trace, 
Bright faces, sunny landscapes, that still smile at 
every care, 
Thy ashes tell us we must die, but thoughts of 
sorrow chase, 
And with our fire-side songs, my merry hearts 
defy despair.

The Naughty, 
BY CHARLES DIBDIN. 
Tom Tackle was noble— was true to his word,— 
If merit bought titles, Tom might be a 
lord ; 
How gaily his bark through life's ocean would sail ! 
Truth furnisli'd the rigging, and honor the gale. 
Yet Tom has a 
failino., 
if ever man had, 
That good as he was, made hlm all that was bad, 
He was paltry, and pitiful, scurvy, and mean, 
And the snivelino.est scoundrel that ever wis seen, 
For so said the girls, and the landlord's long score, 
Would you know what his fault was 2—Tom 
Tackle was poor. 
'Twas once on a 
time, when they took a 
galleon, 
And the crew touched the agent for cash to some 
tune, 
Tom a 
trip took to jail, an old messmate to free, 
And four thankful prattlers soon sat on his knee : 
Then Toni was an angel, downright from Heaven 
sent, 
While they'd hands he his goodness should never 
repent. 
Return'd from next voyage, he bemoan'd his sad 
case 
To find his dear friend shut the door in his face ! 
" 
Why, dye wonder ?" cried one, " you're served 
right, to be sure,— 
" 
Once Tom Tackle wa ,

But don't this same honor concern poor and rich ?

And if ever tar had a 
good heart, it was Tom ; 
Yet, somehow or 'nother, Torn never did right ;

None knew better the time when to spare or to 
fight; 
He, by finding a leak once, preserved crew and. 
ship, 
Saved the commodore's life—then he made such 
rare flip ; 
And yet, fir all this,' no one Torn could endure, 
I 
fancy, as how, 'twas because he was poor. 
At last, an old shipmate, that Torn might hail land, 
Who saw that his heart sail'd too fast for hand, 
in the riding of comfort a 
mooring to find, 
Reefd the sails of Tom's fortune, that shook in the 
wind; 
He gave him enough through life's ocean, to steer, 
By the breeze which it might, steady, thus, or no 
near ; 
His pittance is daily, and yet Torn imparts 
What he can to his friends ; and may all honest 
hearts, 
Like Tom Tackle, have what keeps the wolf from 
the door, 
Just enough to be generous—too much to be poor.

While I

And, blithe as the lark, that each day hails the

Vows are many—truth is rare. 
He is courtly, she is simple, 
Lordly doublet speaks his lot; 
She is wearing hood and wimple—

Sweeter far she deems his whisper, 
Than the night-bird's dulcet thrill ; 
She is smiling, he beguiling ;

The Naughty, 
In a Garret Near the Sky. 
AIR—" In the Cottage by the Sea." 
Happy days now pass before me, 
When I'm in my snug retreat; 
And I 
feel my spirits rising, 
With all creation at my feet. 
A cottage by the sea so damp is, 
And de walls are nebber dry ; 
Berry warm I 
feel, no cramp is, 
In a 
garret near the sky. 
De music ob de waves is charming, 
in a 
Cottage by the Sea; 
De chance of drowning is alarming, 
Such music bath no charms for me. 
I 
sleeps no fear of dangers meeting, 
And I 
close each weary eye ; 
With little Patti sounds so sweet, 
In a 
garret near the sky. 
Dey say de sea breeze it am bracing, 
And de landscape berry fine: 
On de beach see donkeys racing, 
And de gals with crinoline. 
No big waves can I 
see rolling, 
Scenes more lubly meet my eye ; 
Sparrows hopping, torn cats strolling, 
In a 
garret near the sky. 
And yet for all there is delight, 
As you gaze upon de sea ; 
And de sea birds in their flight, 
Reminding me of liberty. 
When I 
tink ob dat I 
ponder, 
And de thought occurs to me ; 
After all would live, and wander 
In a 
cottage by the sea.

Ant.—" The Last Shilling." 
I 
had knock'd out the dust from my pipe fother 
night, 
Old Tine towards midnight was creeping; 
The last smoke from its ashes had taken its flight, 
I 
felt neither sleeping nor waking. 
A 
voice, loud and hollow, and seemingly near, 
(You'll say 'tis a 
dream or a 
fable) 
Directed towards me, said audibly clear, 
" 
List to me, list to me, thy oak table." 
" I 
was once of the forest the monarch so bold, 
Nor tempest nor storm made me tremble; 
And oft, very oft, the famed Druids of old 
Would under my branches assemble ; 
Their mysterious rites they perform'd before me ; 
Those rites to unfold I 
am able ; 
But be that forgot—I 
was then an oak tree, 
And now I 
am but an oak table. 
" 
But the axe brought me down, and soon lopp'd 
was each bough, 
When I 
to a 
ship was converted ; 
Manned by true hearts of oak, the wide ocean.- to 
plough, 
And by victory never deserted. 
But worn out by time, and reduced to a 
wreck, 
Bereft of my anchor and cable; 
A 
carpenter bought, and, with part of my deck, 
Made me what you see now—an oak table. 
" 
Now thrust in a 
corner—put out of the way, 
(But I 
fear I 
your patience am tiring,) - 
I 
expect nothing less than, some forthcoming day, 
To be broke up and used for your firing." 
" 
No, never," cried I, as I 
started awake, 
" 
I'll keep thee as long as I'm able, 
And each friend that my humble cheer will par-
take 
Shall be welcomed around my oak table."

A page with a

There came out a

And leap'd on the courser's back ;

And was it but to betray ?

It has borne me high to the dark lee shore, 
But we struggled heart and hand. 
And a 
fight with the sea in its angry roar, 
Shames all your strife on land. 
The storm was long, but found me true, 
So mother be proud of your boy in blue. 
And if the breakers kill our ship, 
And your boy goes down in the foam, 
Be sure the last breath on his lip, 
Is a 
prayer for those at home. 
But come, cheer up, methinks I

Luck in life, or good or bad, 
Ne'er could make me melancholy, 
Seldom rich, yet never sad, 
Sometimes poor but always jolly;

Yet I

Ha. ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha ! 
With laughing at their comic phizzes 
After that, in love I 
fell, 
(Love creates a 
deal of trouble,) 
But my courtship, strange to tell, 
Only made my mirth redouble; 
I 
laughed—she frowned— I 
laughed again, 
Till I 
brought her to the tether, 
Then she smiled—we wed—since then 
We mean to laugh through life together,

Thy twinkling footstep, dull and slow, 
Or blanch'd thy sunny hair.

DE WITT'S 
TEN CENT ROMANCES. 
It is the object of the publisher of this series of popular low 
priced books, to present readers with a 
library of intensely in 
fictions, based mainly upon real incidents—descriptive 
of Border, Indian, Trapper, and Hunter Life. 
Every book will 
be a 
complete novel of itself. 
Authors of first-class reputation 
will furnish the tales; which will far surpass in interest and 
graphic power any similar works ever published. 
Each book will contain one hundred pages, printed on fine 
white paper; and will be enclosed in a 
handsome cover, with an 
illustrated engraving; and sold at the remarkably low price of 
TEN. CENTS. 
Haw Ready: 
No. I. THE DEMON OF THE DESERT. 
This book is one of the most powerfully exciting novels ever written. 
The 
scenes are laid in Southern Texas—the land of the rifle, the tomahawk and the 
scalping knife. 
Strange and terrible adventures crimson almost every page. 
Wondrous contrasts keep the reader's attention engaged. 
The beautiful Prai-
rie Girl and the devilish half-breed—the generous young Hunter and the 
awful Fear of the Forest cross each other's paths. 
The fawn and the ja-
guar—the dove, 
and the vulture—are types of the unceasing struggle of in-
nocence and vice—perpetually oocurring on every leaf of this startling book. 
No. 2. PRAIRIE PETE; or, tlio Trapriors 
Of all the isles of wild adventure in forest and prairie, this is the most ex-
cellent. 
The reader seems to actually hear the yell of the demon red skins, 
sees their painted faces, and witness the lurid flames of the frontier log 
cabin. 
Hears, too, the sharp rifle crack of the hunter and the trapper as 
they send the unerring bullet of the avenger into the cruel hearts of the for-
est desperado. The vast expanse of the flower-carpeted prairie—the gloomy 
vista of the dense forest—the silver lake—the high peaked mountains, and 
the dark caverns, haunts of the wild cat and the grizly-bear, are all produ-
ced with vividness and wonderful power, in this captivating story. 
For Sale by all News Dealers; or, sent, POST PAID, to any ad-
dress, on receipt of price, TEN CENTS.
