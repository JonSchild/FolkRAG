Summary of Interview: Gina Bryan describes growing up in Milwaukee within a family of 
educators. She talks about working as a nurse in an Emergency Department, which she describes 
as fast-paced and stressful. She states that she became licensed as an Advanced Practice Nurse 
Practitioner (APNP) working in mental health, and she went on to obtain a PhD in health policy 
to be an advocate due to the stigma that still surrounds mental health. She describes nursing as a 
privilege and a service profession that is a part of her identity.

Introduction 
0.00.25 
She talks about growing up in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Her parents were 
educators. She describes her family as “traditional.” Her aunts, uncles, and some 
of grandparents were all teachers; that was her initial career goal as education was 
a big part of her life growing up. She does think it was a bridge into healthcare as 
right now her role as a nurse, she says, is as an educator. Her family talked about 
social justice, politics, public health, access to health environments, etc.  
0.03.28 
Her parents were involved in various programs for diversity in public education. 
Milwaukee has a history of and reputation for segregation, disparities in public 
schools in the city vs the suburbs. “Being in Milwaukee and dealing with some of 
the issues that we struggle with in Milwaukee around segregation, access to good 
healthcare, the discrepancies between public schools in Milwaukee and public 
schools in the surrounding suburbs, that was absolutely from a very young age 
something that was, again, dinner table conversation.” Her parents were active in 
the community. Set a “culture” very early on in her life where she voiced her 
opinions and felt heard.  
0.05.25 
She talks about considering health care in high school, she’d started volunteering 
at Children’s Hospital in Milwaukee. “At the time we still called them Candy 
Stripers. We don’t use that term anymore, but I was working in different units … 
spending time with kids if their parents couldn’t be there … It was my first time I 
had concentrated time with health care providers.” She also shadowed her own 
pediatrician; she would go in the room with patients, “He wasn’t super formal … 
It was an exposure to roles I didn’t really think about.”  
0.07.16 
She describes how she still thought she’d be a teacher when starting college, but 
eventually moved into health care. “The ideas of social justice, serving people that 
were underserved. Having access to people’s lives was really appealing to me” 
[laughs]. She talks about how at an early age her teachers had all said she talked a 
lot in class, called her a “busybody,” and “thinks she’s in charge of the 
classroom.” “I have always been really interested in human beings … From day 
one, I had a real interest in individual stories and in community stories. I think it’s 
what has continually drawn me into mental health and psychiatry.”

She went to undergrad at UW-Madison. She talks about making her decisions to 
go into healthcare, but not for nursing. She’d planned to go to medical school. She 
took pre-med courses but went to a nursing info session with a friend. She became 
interested, but she thought about it still as a step to med school.  
0.10.54 
She applied to nursing school at UW-Madison; she also got into med school, but 
then decided to stay in nursing. “It was at that time I realized I really had fallen in 
love with nursing. I thought this was a fit for me clinically, professionally.”  
0.11.32 
At this time, she says, it was general practice nursing rather than mental health. 
She talks about working at a camp during the summer with kids who had 
HIV/AIDS. She knew she wanted to be a Nurse Practitioner, possibly in 
infectious disease. She did an independent study at Journey Mental Health Center 
(which at the time was the Dane County Mental Health Center). “At the time that 
I was in school, there were very few psychiatric Advanced Practice nurses.” Talks 
about the process of nurse practitioners getting “prescriptive authority” in 
Wisconsin.  
0.13.44 
She describes working with an Advanced Practice NP in mental health at Journey 
and independent practice. “I fell in love with that role. It was the first time I’d 
seen someone acutely psychotic or living with a manic episode. It was like this 
whole world opened up.” She says she was “fascinated” with the role and with the 
brain. “It felt like I had found my spot in healthcare. It was serving people that 
didn’t have access to care, that were really quite ill.” 
0.14.34 
Gina talks about her first job out of undergrad as an emergency room nurse. “I 
liked the acuity …  With thoughtful evidence-based interventions people got 
better.” She states that even then advocacy was important and early intervention 
was important.  
0.15.24 
She describes more about working at Dane County (Journey). “It was probably 
the first time I truly saw team-based care. It was really interdisciplinary, when it 
worked well it was interdisciplinary. We’d go to these staffings or case reviews, it 
really was this team of people that came together. They’d brainstorm; they’d 
challenge each other. It reminded me of that dinner table again, at home. I was 
like, ‘These are my people!’” Healthcare should be a respectful debate amongst 
people. Also, motivated by research and clinical opportunities. Describes the job 
as real community-based practice. 
0.17.11 
It was different; she says from her nursing school education though she had done 
a community-based clinical. She describes how the clinicals work in most nursing 
schools; for instance, a lot of students might be interested in peds (pediatrics), but 
there are only six slots open. She talks more about her rotation in a community-
based setting, it was with the Ho-Chunk nation. She loved that setting; at times, 
she would go into people’s homes.  
0.19.00 
She talks about that first job more after undergrad. “Culturally in nursing there is 
absolutely this argument that continues until today, if you are going to be a 
psychiatric nurse … You need to do time in a medical setting.” She knew she 
wanted to go to graduate school, so she worked in medical nursing to have a good 
background. The things she now tells students is that there is no “right” plan. She 
notes she never worked in primary care, but she still knows about those things 
from school. People’s scope and competencies vary.

0.21.27 
“There is still a stigma with mental health nursing that your skills—and I do that 
with a parenthesis—and your value as a nurse is what you can do, skills. I can put 
in an IV this fast; I can try blood this quick … That that is where value lies. We 
see that in healthcare … ‘Oh, you’re a psychiatrist.’ That means you don’t have 
knowledge in some of these areas. We don’t say to primary care, who manages a 
lot of mental health, ‘Oh, you’re not board certified in psychiatry.’” She explains 
that the skill-based professions have higher salaries.  
0.22.42 
She gives an example of how she explains this to her students. For example, in 
cardiology, we know a ton about how the heart functions and exactly how the 
medications work. Whereas in mental health, might not be able to say specifically 
how a medication will affect them. “I know about the function in the body, but I 
can’t tell you Charitie or Bob or Grace this is gonna work the same for you.” This 
vagueness can be hard for providers and for patients. There are no black and 
white answers. 
0.24.06 
Working in crisis unit for 17  years, most patients were under a Chapter 51 
commitment [court ordered treatment] and they had to take the medications but 
couldn’t give them specific timelines or outcomes. Psychiatry can be a “grey” 
area with a lot of ambiguity. “Some people gravitate towards that and their 
personality is such that they say ‘It’s intriguing to me. I feel and empathize with 
people in those situations’ … It calls to you or it doesn’t more so than most areas 
of health care.” Psych not the largest draw for students.  
0.26.30 
She states there is evidence that many people who work in mental health have had 
some personal experience.  She talks about articles on “wounded healers” (though 
she doesn’t like that term); providers having mental health diagnoses themselves. 
She adds though that education has kind of moved past this phrase because we 
know more about the mental health of students and health care providers.  
0.28.00 
“Nursing has the worst health outcomes.” She describes reasons for this. Health 
worsens during first few years of practice for many reasons including “Our ethical 
obligations don’t line up with what we are asked to do.” She talks about the 
causes for burnout among nurses. “Being asked to do work that doesn’t align with 
your belief system.”  
0.29.22 
She talks about the patient population that she works with and the constraints 
she’s under (for example, a 30-minute appointment) as well as the various 
economic and social factors affecting them.  
0.30.31 
She states that she became interested in policy after serving people who didn’t 
have access to what they needed. Her doctorate focused on health care policy and 
access. She says she really felt the need to be an advocate. “I had the privilege of 
having this degree and being able to take time from my life to advocate for 
policy.” She clarifies what her degrees are: BSN, MS (not MSN) in psychiatric 
nursing which led her to be an Advanced Practice Nurse Prescriber (APNP), and 
then DNP all from UW-Madison.  
0.33.18 
Charitie asks her to back up a bit to describe her first stay on the job when she 
graduates from nursing school. She describes the emergency room setting; 
historically new grads don’t go into the ER or ICU as older nurses with more 
experience usually got those jobs. She says in part she got the job because of a 
nursing shortage and the hospital was recruiting nurses into these units as a sort of 
Page 4 of 6 
 
residency to get them better trained. She was a “pilot” student; paired with 
experiences nurse who was a mentor.  
0.34.40 
“I did not have very many clinical skills; I walked into a fast-paced, really intense 
environment. My first day was July 4, which was a holiday. If you know about 
emergency departments, holidays are extremely busy.” She describes UW 
hospital a bit more, type of hospital, type of traumas, and so on. She explains 
what a “level-one” trauma center means; med-flight access, most critical patients. 
“I was a bit over my head.”  
0.36.15 
She explains that “everyone has a role in a trauma” and trauma centers are rated 
on how quickly they can stabilize a patient. “Everyone’s got a role and you don’t 
deviate from that role;  you move quickly, and you don’t screw up.” It was intense 
and cause her some anxiety even though she likes that environment. She describes 
herself as being motivated by stress typically but in this job “I was scared out of 
my mind to the point I was vomiting before coming into work.” “I’d hear the 
chimes and want to hide, the chimes meaning it would be a code and you need to 
take the cart from the ER. I’d find myself hiding because I was scared. I was 
humiliated by that. I didn’t want to ask bad questions.” You don’t want to be the 
one that asks the “dumb question.” 
0.38.00 
She talks about a wonderful mentor she had encouraged her. He had a traumatic 
experience as a doctor that made him very aware of students’ reluctance to ask 
questions. She explains being a preceptor (mentor to young nurses) and how 
important it is to have students see that they can ask questions without fear. 
Medical errors are a huge problem especially when new students arrive.  
0.39.23 
“What is the culture of any setting that allows you to ask questions and not be 
shamed by asking those questions. And we’re not there yet in healthcare. We still 
shame people. We believe this hazing, for lack of a better term, that we all went 
through is the right way to learn because it worked for us.” [she hits the table for 
emphasis]. She notes here the influence of growing up with educators. 
0.40.20 
How to ask questions that aren’t shameful; it might seem like a basic question but 
your first time with a patient or with death “I didn’t see someone die in nursing 
school, well guess what, I did two weeks into practice.” She talks about 
frustrations she experienced being the new nurse and the culture of the ER. 
“Where in education in nursing did I learn about what it was like to experience 
anything … I hear about trauma 90% of the time … I listen all day long” “Where 
do we teach students about how you live with that? Where do you teach students 
wellness?” “We still haven’t figured out how to teach that.” [hits table for 
emphasis]. 
0.42.26 
Charitie asks how Gina learned these things. “You found people. They seem to be 
doing okay, how did they deal with that?” She notes she still isn’t great at coping 
skills for herself. Balance is hard; for example, she can’t go home if her notes 
aren’t done. “Balance isn’t the right word for me. How do I find energy? How do 
I find mechanisms  to get done the work I’m doing while still caring about the 
work I do? How do I ground myself before I go into an appointment?” “I know 
the person I’m going to see, sometimes I’m their only social contact for a month.” 
She emphasizes how important it is to be “really present” for them.

0.44.15 
She talks about some of her own medical experiences, pregnancy for example. 
She uses those experiences to help her connect with patients and empathize with 
them. She shares how she felt speaking with a provider and how important those 
moments were for her during pregnancy. She uses this as a reminder when she is 
working with patients. She talks about “health care IQ.”  
0.46.42 
“Before I walk into a room, I stop, I take three or four deep breaths, kind of that 
mindfulness I’m teaching patients all the time, but I thought ‘That’s not for me, 
I’m not a touchy-feely person.’ But it changed my practice when I said, I’m just 
going to take a minute, take a couple deep breaths, remember who I’m going in to 
see. All the things that now I try to share with my students.”  
0.47.04 
She sees herself as a clinician, “You can never take me away from my patients.” 
She didn’t see herself going into teaching. She says she pursued it because it 
allowed her to work in policy as an academic. She then got excited about teaching 
as she worked with students. “If I educated new mental health providers, they 
were going to improve access. They were going to go out into the community.” 
Notes that nursing needs more diverse teachers. She’s been teaching for six years. 
0.48.35 
She states she’s taught interdisciplinary; in medicine, pharmacy, and nursing. But 
maintains clinical practice (she’s a clinical faculty full-time) while being a full 
professor. She works now in Janesville and Beloit in Rock County rather than 
Dane County. She’s an APNP.  
0.49.33 
Gina describes her current job in Rock County. She works with underserved 
populations and rural communities outside of Janesville. She talks about urban 
areas in Wisconsin versus most of the rest of the state, which is rural. How rural 
versus urban areas impact services and care.  
0.51.10 
Charitie asks how mental health has changed over her career. She describes how 
the general public has become more family with Nurse Practitioners. Other 
clinicians are also more aware of what her license allows her to do, for example 
prescribe medications. She talks about some of her policy work related to 
prescriptive authority and legal issues, “collaborative agreement.” Issues with 
access and number of psychiatric providers in Wisconsin. 
0.53.30 
She notes that substance abuse use has changed over time. States that “as a 
provider we’ve created a lot of the problems around opiate abuse. What does that 
feel like to be part of the problem?” Substance abuse has always been a problem 
in mental health, but what it looks like specifically, and in children for example, 
has changed. Children being treated with antipsychotics who are now coming of 
age. How has this changed their lives and their brains? 
0.55.38 
She talks about how psych has often been collaborative and interdisciplinary; 
always work with therapists and social workers or with mental health aides. One 
thing is that training for APNPs has moved away from therapy and more towards 
prescribing medications. In part, she says this is due to how insurance 
reimbursement works. “You get paid higher percentages for doing that work 
[prescribing].”  
0.57.05 
She says another change is the focus on wellness; she pushes harder for educating 
patients about health broadly: nutrition, exercise, mindfulness. “If you look at 
billing items, you can’t bill for education around nutrition.” She notes that 
Page 6 of 6 
 
exercise can be as effective as medications for depression and should be conveyed 
to students more clearly.
