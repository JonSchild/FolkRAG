Wife Wrapped in Wether's Skin
WIFE WRAPPED IN WETHER'S SKIN
This old man walked to his sneep pen And off he jerked a wether's skin.
He wrapped it all around his wife's back And with a switch he made it crack.
“I'll tell my father and all my kin That you whipped me in a wether's skin,”
“You may tell your father and all your kin I'll do what I please with my own wether's skin.”
