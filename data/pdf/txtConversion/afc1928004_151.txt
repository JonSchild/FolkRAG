Written by NED HARRIDAN, 
Originally Sting:by HARRIGAN & HART. 
OH kape your eyes on us now, 
We're twins as ye plainly see, 
The way that we suffer now, 
We'll expose it all to ye; 
Brought up on mush and milk, 
From small little babies, oh, 
We're the Mulcahey Twins, 
The pets of the ladies, oh. 
It took two hundred days ye know, 
To cross the big ocean, oh, 
The:ship she was tossing, oh, 
Wid awful commotion, oh; 
We 
had nothing to ate, agrah, 
But oatmeal and praties, oh, 
Had the Mulcahey Twins. 
The pets of the ladies, oh. 
Let all of yees Yankee boys,

For 
ourselves that has kim here, 
To lave an example, oh; 
If yees have any grudge against,

BIG AND THE LITTLE OF IT. 
Original by HARRIGAN A: 
II Arrr. 
First Lover. 
I'VE just arrived in town to day, 
To see the girl I 
love, 
She lives in yonder little cot, 
She is my turtle dove; 
I 
know I've got a 
rival, 
That comes here on the sly, 
I'm bound to have the girl you bet, 
At least I'm going to try. 
Oh, my, the girl she must be mine, 
With her Grecian bend stuck out behind, 
I'm bound to have the girl you know, 
The:fairest in the land, 
And I 
never will be satisfied, 
Until I 
take her hand. 
_Second Lover 
I 
wonder who that feller was, 
lie thinks he cuts a 
shine, 
lie comes around the girl I 
love, 
And very soon I'll find; 
he'd better quickly take a 
walk, 
On him I'll put a 
head, 
And send him home with his Ma, 
She'll put him right in bed. 
Oh, my, the girl, &c. 
Both. 
Oh, what's the matter? excuse me, sir, 
What was you doing here ? 
Second Lover. 
I 
came to court the girl I 
love, 
Now don't you interfere. 
First Lover. 
I'd interfere, just if I 
like, 
For you was now on time. 
Second Lover. 
I 
reckon not if I 
know myself, 
She promised to be mine. 
Oh, my, the girl, &c.

GIRL WITH THE FLOWING HAIR. 
Original. HARRIGAN & HART. 
MY thoughts of a 
girl I 
can't conceal, 
I 
met the ether day, 
She'd a 
dainty foot and a 
lovely heel, 
With, oh, such a 
winning way; 
No duck in a 
pond was half so light, 
As she with her careless air, 
The veil she wore was scarlet bright, 
The girl with the flowing hair. 
CHORUS. 
Oh! my heart_ pit-pat as she plssed me by, 
So beautiful and fair, 
She glanced at me with her soft blue eye, 
The girl with the flowing hair. 
We met again, 'twas in a 
set, 
At the colored waiter's ball, 
As I 
balanced across her eye I 
met, 
I 
really thought I'd fall; 
The music stopped, I 
stepped aside 
To let her pass with care, 
To speak to her I 
really tried, 
The girl with the flowing hair. 
Oh! my heart, 
c. 
Oh what is the use of feeling sad, 
When there's lots of pretty girls, 
In this town yet to be had, 
With plenty of silks and curls, 
But she's the only one I 
love, 
I'd tell her if I 
dare, 
She's sweet to me as the turtle dove, 
The girl with the flowing hair. 
! 
my heart, 
ft 
SHE'S ONLY SEVENTEEN. 
Original. HARRIGAN ltz; HART. 
ni in love I'd have you know, 
And the feeling's very queer, 
They call her darling little Flo, 
Her voice I 
love to hear, 
It's sweeter than the blackbird, 
Singing from a 
tree, 
And only her, upon my word, 
I 
love to go and see. 
CIIORL 
It seems just like a 
dream, 
When first I 
met my queen, 
She's this darkey's honey-comb, 
She's only seventeen. 
Oh the rainbow is pretty in the zky, 
And a 
sun-shower very pretty too, 
Methinks I 
hear you all reply 
They are very handsome things to view, 
But perhaps to see this girl you wOullj 
Say she's the prettiest of all, 
If by chance you ever should, 
In love with her you'd fall. 
It seems, &c. 
Her pa I 
went to see, 
And what do you think- ne said ? 
Wait one year—then he'd agree, 
That she and I 
should wed, 
I 
feel sad now, but never mind, 
I'll wait till the year is o'er, 
I'll be so sweet, and twice as kind, 
As I 
ever was before. 
It seems, S:c.

Parody, written for TONY PAST(); by NED HARRIGAN. 
I 
MET Molly in the garden, 
I 
believe 'twas after tea, 
She had on her Dolly Varden, 
She completely dazzled me; 
Oh, tell me, darling, that you love me, 
She gave my little hand a 
squoze 
Take my greenbacks, Molly darling, 
Don't turn up to me your nose. 
CHORUS. 
Molly, fattest, fairest, huggest, 
Look up, darling, tell me that 
You still love me, Molly darling, 
Don't despise me 'cause I'm fat. 
When we're married, Molly darling, 
And you are my loving spouse, 
We'll have lots of Dolly Vardens, 
Playing tag around the house; 
You must give them paregoric, 
Put them in their little bed, 
Should they annoy you, Mol.y darling, 
Gently put on them a 
head. 
Molly, fattest, Sze.

DON'T YOU GRIEVE AFTER ME. 
End Song, as Sung by HARRY KERNELL. 
I 
ONCE knew a 
girl, her name was Susy Horner, 
She is of light complexion and she lives around the corner, 
I 
told her that I 
loved her, she said she was a 
goner, 
I 
told her not to grieve after me. 
CHORUS. 
When I 
am gone, I 
told her not to grieve, 
When I 
am gone, [SYMPHONY.] 
When I 
am gone I 
told her not to grieve, 
Oh, I 
told her not to grieve after me. 
Oh, Susan says to me, I 
want your hand in marriage, 
She put her hand in her pocket to pay for the carriage; 
Den I 
says, Susy, I'll pay for the ferriage, 
But don't you grieve after me. 
When I 
am gone, tt,c. 
I 
kissed her three, she then began to cry, 
She had a 
blubber on her cheek, and a 
tear in her eye, 
I 
says, Susy dear, I'll be back bye and bye, 
Oh, don't you grieve after me. 
When I

DAINTY LITTLE NAN. 
OH, I'M WASTING AWAY. 
HARRIGAN & HART. 
OH, tu can guess why I 
come here. 
Dressed in my best attire, 
I 
feel so good, oh my, oh dear, 
My bosom is on tire, 
It caught the flame from a 
little dove. 
So close to me she ran, 
And ever since I've been in love 
With dainty little Nan. 
CHORUS. 
Dainty little Nan, 
I'll do everything I 
can, 
Your fancy for to please, 
You're sweeter than a 
plum, 
.And always full of fun, 
Like the little birds singing from the trees. 
Oh, I 
got acquainted with her ma, 
And the way it came around, 
I 
was riding in a 
city horse-car 
To my residence, way up-town, 
"I' you please," says she, " I'll take a 
seat, 
While you hold my daughter's fan." 
I 
took one look, there laughing sweet, 
Sat dainty little Nan. 
Dainty little Nan, Sse. 
Oh, what a 
pleasant, quiet chat, 
I 
had with Nan alone, 
I 
talked ot this, I 
talked of that, 
'Till we arrived at home. 
Oh, I 
like her, and she likes me, 
And now I 
must away, 
Little Nan I'm going to see, 
For her folks are out to-day. 
Dainty little Nan, ..te. 
By NED HARRIGAN. 
Sung by TONY PASTOR, 
OH, I'm a 
sample of a 
used-up man, 
Afflicted with a 
thousand a 
s, 
1 
can't get fat, do what I 
can, 
Just look at these half-starved gills. 
My parents were as thin as I, 
They never had a 
shadow—so people 3a;, 
They wen't off like a 
puff, they could'nt the, 
And their boy is wasting away. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, it's a 
pity that I'm so thin, 
I'm sure that I 
shall never get fat, 
I 
look like a 
small-sized clothes pin, 
To find me you must get a 
map. 
The doctor recommended me, 
To drink nothing else but so-long tea, 
But I 
busted a 
brewery not far from here, 
Where they sold Cincinnati beer; 
Oh, I 
worry and cry, and sob, and fret, 
To see my friends grow stout and gay, 
Fat on me I'll never get, 
For, oh, I'm wasting away. 
Oh, it's a 
pity, ex. 
All the gals they do me shun, 
And shake me for some other fell, 
They say I 
look like the barrel of a 
gun, 
Could be used for an umbrell; 
Oh, what will I 
do? Oh, where will I 
go ? 
In the eye of an needle I 
make my stay, 
I'll never come out, till I 
get stout, 
For, oh, I'm wasting away. 
Oh, it's a 
pity, &c.

ue. 
Am,..—Never Push a 
Man Gong Down the Hill. 
IN this wide world there!s many a 
man, 
With brave and honest heart, 
That's struggling on from day to day, 
Striving to get a 
start; 
But envious eyes are on him, boys, 
Foes seek to do him ill, 
And slander him behind his back, 
To keep him down the hill. 
CHORUS. 
Then believe not all you hear, my boys, 
About your fellow man, 
For foes will often lie you know, 
To injure if they can; 
But search it through and through, my boys, 
Until you prove it true, 
And that's the time to talk, my boys, 
But not before you do. 
But oh, how many men there are 
Believe what's told for sure, 
Will tell it the first they meet, 
Adding a 
little more, 
And so the tale gets worse, my boys, 
Spreads quicker then wild-fire, 
Ten thousand curses on the head 
Of every slandering liar. 
Then believe, (9

Just one more word before I 
stop, 
I 
wish you all to know 
What everybody says is true, 
T 
say it is not so. 
For everybody sometimes lies, 
My song will prove to you, 
And hoping you'll take my advice, 
nt bid you now adieu, 
Then believe, ,k.c. 
LIZZIE BELL, 
SONG AND DANCE. 
ROVING through the wild wood, 
Where the pretty stream does flow, 
I've seen the house where I 
was born 
Some twenty years ago; 
I 
remember the happy days I 
had, 
In that house where I 
did dwell, 
And that pretty girl I 
used to play with, 
Her name is Lizzie Bell. 
CHORUS. 
To me she's like a 
twinkling star, 
Shining for me ever far, 
She knows that I 
do love her, 
But she does'nt like to tell, 
For I 
think there's none above her— 
My little Lizzie Bell. 
I 
gazed on it in ecstacy, 
It was to me a 
dream, 
Thinking of the fun me and Lizzie had 
When yachting in the stream; 
I 
used to sing her my pretty song 
Of yachting in the bay, 
She used to tell me it was delightful, 
And thought it very gay. 
To me she's, Sr,c. 
I've seen her since and asked her to be mine, 
And she has answered yes, 
Now I 
am as happy as any one, 
I 
really do confess, 
We are a 
happy couple, 
As ever you did see, 
For we always travel together, 
Me and little Lizzie. 
To me she's, &c

SQUINTY DAN. 
BANJO SOLO. 
I'LL tell you of a 
nice young man, 
And of a 
maiden gal; 
The neighbors called him Squinty Dan, 
And she long-legged Sal. 
They lived down on Centre Street, 
And loved each other well; 
And its o! a 
dismal history, 
That now I'm going to tell. 
Now Squinty Dan he had red hair, 
And looked two ways for Monday, 
lie peddled clams around the street, 
On every day but Sunday 
But Sundays Squinty Dan would go 
To court long-legged Sal, 
And take her to ride in his clam-barouchc 
On the banks of Gowanns canal. 
He used to feed her on clam-soup, 
Clam-chowder, and clam-pie, 
And send her lots of long-necked clams, 
For her to roast and fry: 
Till the neighbors gals, through jealwisy, 
Made up a 
horrid plan 
To freeze the love in the bosom of 
her darling Squinty Dan. 
When Squinty Dan heard the news, 
He climbed to a 
chimney-top, 
He pulled a 
pound of powder out, 
And down be let it drop: 
At ilassied up with a 
fearful roar, 
And blowed him so far on high, 
He never came down—and that is the last 
Of this mournful his-to-7.

THE DANCING APOLLO. 
HERE I 
am with blubber lips, 
Feet just like a 
pair of ships, 
Nose as flat as ever built, 
Eyes like holes burnt in a 
quilt, 
Mouth that spreads from ear to ear, 
Monkey shines and actions queer, 
Dancing like a 
crazy one, 
To fill you with delight. 
Ctioncs. 
Kick up shins, 
Full of grins, 
These the pins 
That always wins, 
Coming like an avalanche to greet you every night. 
Nigger is the gre:,t man now, 
That white folks must allow, 
Everybody clears the track, 
When they see a 
man that's black, 
Woolly head it is a 
sign, 
That the owner's bound to shine, 
If you say he isn't, 
There's sure to be a 
fight.

Kick up shins,

Dancing is my greatest glee, 
When these hoofs get on a 
spree, 
Spreading out upon the ground, 
Filling up for miles around, 
Death upon all creeping things, 
Loud applause my talent brings, 
I 
always feel as bully 
As if I 
was half white. 
Kick up shins, .tc. 
The constables shut down on tods, 
That makes to me but little odds, 
I 
never want to touch a 
sup, 
While I 
can keep my spirits up; 
And while the ladies take a 
glance 
To see Apollo in the dance, 
I 
like to see them view me 
With approval and delight. 
Kick tip shins, Ltc.

H.ETTY CLOVER. 
SONG AND DANCE. 
'TIS of a 
girl I'm going to sing, 
And her fortunes to relate, 
Reconstructed site has been 
From old Carolina State; 
Her eyes were bright, her teeth were white, 
But her feet they spread all over, 
If you wish to learn her cognomen, 
'Tis pretty Hetty Clover: 
CHORUS. 
Hetty, (Sim) Hetty, (Svm.) 
You may search this world all over, 
You'll never find so sweet a 
girl 
As pretty Hetty Glover. 
asked Miss Hetty for hei hand, 
When she began to sigh, 
Your refusal, Hetty, dear, 
Will cause me for to die. 
She threw her arms around my neck, 
And kissed my face all over, 
She said your mine through life or death, 
My own devoted lover.. 
Hetty, (
vi.) Jce. 
In a 
little while we were wed, 
I 
had a 
small amount of cash, 
A 
dandy nig he came along 
With a 
big moustache; 
My Hetty fell in love with him, 
My happiness was over, 
lie came one night and did elope 
With my false Hetty Clover. 
. 
CHORUS. 
Hetty, (Svm.) Iietty, (Svm.) 
You rnay search this world an over, 
You'll never find so false a 
girl, 
As ugly Hetty Clover. 
THE HAPPIEST DARKIES OUT. 
WE'VE just arrived in town to-night, 
Our story for to tell, 
We don't care much if we ain't white, 
Our color suits us well; 
We practice on the heel and toe, 
And then we sing .and shout, 
We're always welcome where we go, 
We're the happiest darkies out. 
CHORUS. 
Just watch the movement of the shin, 
We kick dull care about, 
And always wear a 
jolly grin, 
The happiest darkies out. 
When our plantation work is done, 
We go upon a 
spree, 
ro have a 
little sport and fun, 
Our hearts chock full of glee; 
Let politicians rave and blow, 
Let Horace Greeley spout, 
We care for neither friend nor foe, 
We're the happiest darkies out, 
Just watch, tts. 
35 
37 
36 
We both support double-breasted heels, 
Which bring us lots of cash, 
We both love ' taters and fried eels, 
And don't go back on hash; 
And thus we pass each night and day, 
Take dull care by the snout, 
And make him scoot some other way, 
From the happiest darkies out. 
Just watch, ,k,c, 
We go to a 
fancy colored ball, 
And dance a 
jig or reel, 
We fascinate the wenches all, 
By the movement of the heel. 
They think we are aristocrats 
From Beacon street, do doubt,— 
" 
But no," we cry, " that's all my eye," 
We're the happiest darkies out. 
Just watch, & c. 
The rebels soon will get their pity 
For cutting people's throats, 
And so will Jell, who ran away 
in his wife's petticoats; 
To old Salt,River he will steer, 
Just by the shortest route, 
And we will entertain you here, 
The happiest darkies out, 
Just watch, :kc. 
IOW 
Don't Marry a 
Man if He Drinks. 
Music of this Song to be obtained at Horace Waters' Music Store, 
No. 481 Broadway, New York. 
YOUNG 
ladies, pray listen to me, 
And keep just as quiet as mice, 
While I 
sing you a 
song, it is not very long, 
Which contains quite a 
piece of advice. 
Spoken—It is this: 
No matter what people may say, 
No matter what somebody thinks; 
If you wish to be happy the rest of your days, 
Don't marry a 
man if he drinks, 
Dont marry a 
man if he drinks. 
He may be so handsome and gay; 
And have such a 
beautiful voice; 
And may dance so divinely you'll feel in your heart 
That he must be the man of your choice. 
If his accents are tender and low, 
And sweeter than roses and pinks, 
And his breath quite a 
different thing, you may know 
Your exquisite gentleman drinks. 
'Tis no matter, &c. 
Just think of the sorrows and cares, 
The heart-
rending sighs and the fears, 
Of the words and the blows, and the cruelest woes, 
And then think of an ocean of tears. 
Think of Toodles, the drunkest of men, 
His attitudes, hiccoughs, and winks— 
And then think what a 
dignified pair you will make, 
f 
you marry a 
man and he drinks. 
'Tis no matter, & c. 
Young ladies, look well to your hearts, 
Don't throw them away on a 
sot; 
Or a 
man who is given to treating his friends, 
Whate'er be his station or lot. 
Though his pride may uphold him awhile, 
Yet sooner or later he sinks; 
Then if you would be happy the rest of your days, 
Don't marry a 
man if he drinks. 
,'Tis no matter, &c. 
38 
FOLKS THAT PITT ON AIRS. 
OH ! white folks listen, will you now, 
This darkie's gwine to sing; 
I've hit upon a 
subject now, 
I 
think will be the thing. 
I 
never like to mix at all 
-With any one's affairs, 
But my opinion am just now 
'Bout folks that put on airs. 
CHORUS. 
No use talking, no use talking, 
It's so now everywhere, 
To do as folks of fashion do 
You've got to put on airs. 
De Politician first of all, • 
On 'lection day will stand, 
And every man dat passes by 
He'll shake him by the hand. 
But when he gets a 
good fat job, 
For dat am all he cares, 
He thinks himself some pumpkins den, 
Oh ! don't he put on airs. 
No use talking, &e. 
When a 
gal gets ' bout sixteen, 
She 'gins to think she's some, 
A 
fop dat sports a 
big moustache 
She kinder likes to come. 
Two hours 'fore de looking-glass 
To meet him she prepares, 
And when she gets her tixins on, 
Oh! don't she put on airs. 
No use talking, &c. 
A 
boy, too, when he's ' bout half-grown, 
Although he's " nary red," 
Has lots of hair around his mouth, 
But none upon his head. 
He patronizes tailor shops, 
Gets trust for all he wears, 
And when he goes amongst de gals, 
Oh ! don't he put on airs. 
No use talking, &c. 
THE GRECIAN BEND. 
OH, here we are a 
lovely pair, 
And ain't we dressed complete, 
On every pleasant afternoon 
We promenade the street. 
Oh Sal likes me and I 
like her 
She's one I'll recommend 
To cut a 
swell, for she's the belle 
That swings the Grecian Bend. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, I 
have (she has) got the Grecian Bend, 
Just look at that (my) pannier, 
Oh, it's (that's) the style I'll recommend. 
For a 
belle to engineer. 
am—Oh, yes I 
think this style tip-top. 
Now list I'll tell you why, 
Whenever out we promenade, 
I 
attract each passer by; 
They stop and look and make remarks, 
I 
hear their voices blend— 
Oh, ain't she sweet when on the street, 
She swings her Grecian Bend. 
Oh, I 
have (she has) got, &c.

••• 
In Harlem Lane, there once did dwell a 
charming little beau, 
With whom I 
walked and sometimes talked, his christian name 
[was Joe ; 
I 
knew that he was fond of me, though he never told me so, 
But when my hand in his was pressed, I 
said 0

CHORUS. 
0, Squeeze me, Joe, 0, Squeeze me, Joe, 
It makes me feel so jolly you know ; 
0, squeeze me, Joe, 0, squeeze me, Joe, 
And if you love me tell me so. 
He kept a 
pretty little farm, and horses he had three, 
Se he said, my dear, there'll be no harm to take a 
ride with me, 
lie did and slipp'd from off the horse, and caught me you must 
[know; 
Then placed his arm around my waist, when I 
cried, don't 
CHO.— [squeeze me Joe. 
He popp'd the question there and then, he did upon my life, 
And said my little darling, will you really he my wife ; 
I 
gave a 
sigh, then said, 0 
my, I 
really can't say no; 
I'll be your wife and joy through life, if you'll only squeeze me 
CHO.— [Joe 
I 
married him then, and now am happy as can be, 
For the little farm, and all its charms of course belong to me, 
And when he says, I'm going away, to town for a 
day or so, 
I 
can't do less than give a 
kiss, and say, 0, squeeze me, Joe.

Oravin' to know it my darlin' remembers, 
Or if her thoughts may be crossin' to me.

Dolly! Dolly! Dolly ! Dolly Varden. 
I 
purchased it one fatal day, 
Immediately my mother, 
Whose weight is nearly half a 
ton, 
Rushed out and bought another, 
Miss Smith—and Jones must have one too. 
They're as bold as a 
brass farden, 
And now I'm blessed if grandmother, 
Has'nt got a 
Dolly Varden. 
CII0.— 
I 
see it in my dreams at night, 
No rest I 
ever find sirs, 
I've Dolly Varden on the brain. 
And Chintz upon the mind sirs, 
This fearful fashion haunts me now 
I 
really beg your pardon, 
Rut is there any body here, 
Who wants a 
Dolly Varden.

When The Band Begins To Play, 
I'm very fond of music, 
To me it's quite a 
treat, 
Unless it be from German Bands, 
Or Organs in the street, 
Thro' list'ning to a 
Band one day, 
I 
fairly lost my heart, 
The Leader'twas who found it, 
And he now with it won't part. 
CHORUS. 
Oh I 
I 
feel so awfully jolly when the Band begins to play 
The Band begins to play, 
When the Band begins to play, 
I'm so very fond of music, I 
could listen all the day, 
Especially when my Charlie leads the Band. 
Porn. 
Porn. 
My Charlie is my darling, 
The beau ideal of loves, 
With his hair so black and curly, 
And his whitest of white gloves, 
My love stands in the middle, 
With his Baton in his hand, 
And leads the Instrumentalists, 
In a 
style that I 
think grand. 
CO.— 
They play such jolly music, 
Waltz, Polka and Quadrille ; 
And sometimes play so feelingly. 
It gives me quite a 
thrill; 
The Leader sometimes gives a 
frown, 
And looks as though he's rash ; 
And then they play so soft and sweet, 
And after comes a 
crash. 
Now where my Charlie's to be seen, 
I 
don't intend to tell ; 
For fear that he might captivate, 
Some other Belle as well ; 
lie's asked me one small question, 
I 
gave him lily reply; 
In about a 
month there will not be 
A 
happ:er wife than I.

Ain't it Nice to Have a 
Beau? 
By ARTHUR W . 
FRENCH. 
AS you out a 
walking go, 
When the crowds are in the street, 
Passing by you to and fro, 
Oft by chance somE o 
NE you. meet 
Soon he's walking by your side, 
With his arm in yours—just so— 
Looking down on you with pride— 
Ain't it nice to have a 
beau ? 
Cnouts. 
Ain't it nice to have a 
bean, 
One who loves you well, you know, 
As you out a 
walking go— 
Ain't it nice to have a 
beau ? 
Arm in arm you stray along, 
Envied by each single lass, 
Who from out the passage throng, 
Jealous glances on you cast. 
And the swells that try to flirt 
Find, that they have got no show, 
Deeming you so proud and pert— 
Ain't it nice to have a 
beau ? 
By and. by you reach the door, 
While, of course, just there and then 
Words of love iiE whispers o'er, 
Saying he will come again. 
Loving lips to yours are pressed, 
And you murmur softly—oh! 
Don.'.t you wish you knew the rest ? 
Ain't it nice to have a 
beau ?

MOTHER SAYS I 
IVIUSN"f, 
A NICE young man I 
once knew welt, 
A 
few short years ago, 
lie courting came, in hail or rain, 
lie vowed he loved me so. 
He'd Icily , and sigh with love until 
'Twas time he was away; 
And when he'd ask a 
parting kiss, 
I 
always used to say: 
CHORUS. 
Mother says I 
musnl, 
Mother says I 
musn't, 
01), George, dear George, 
Not just yet awhile, 
Mother says I 
musn't, 
Mother says I 
musn't, 
Oh, George, dear Georgc, 
Not just yet. 
He waiting kept, at last one day, 
lie thought he'd know his fate, 
And sank upon his knees in quite 
An agonizing state. 
Selina, say you'll have your George, 
And when shall we be wed; 
Ile longed to hear me give reply, 
And this is what I 
said: 
Mother says I 
musn't,' &c. 
From then he went to work, indeed, 
lie left no stone unturned; 
Until two thousand dollars a 
year, 
At last he'd really earned. 
My mother heard how things had changed, 
And when we met one day, 
I 
seemed so pleased and so at last 
I 
lovingly did say: 
SPOKEN.—Well, George, darling, as you have improved in 
circumstances since we last met, suppose you ask me agaLi 
that question, eh, what say Georgie Porgey? 
Think of my 
surprise when he said, " You're very kind, but

A 
Starry Night for a 
Ramble. 
I 
LIKE a 
game at Croquet 
Or bowling on the green, 
I 
like a 
little boating 
To pull against the stream, 
But of all the games that I 
love best 
To fill me with delight, 
I 
like to take a 
ramble 
Upon a 
starry night. 
47 
CHORUS. 
A 
starry night for a 
ramble, 
In a 
flow'ry dell, 
Through the bush and bramble, 
Kiss and never tell. 
Talk about your bathing 
Or strolling on the sands 
Or some unseen verandah 
Where gentle zephyr fans, 
Or rolling home in the morning, boys, 
And very nearly tight, 
Could never beat a 
ramble 
Upon a 
starry night. 
A 
starry night :for a 
ramble, etc. 
I 
like to take my sweetheart 
"Of course you would" said he, 
And softly whisper in her ear 
"How dearly I 
love you," 
And when you picture to yourselves 
The scenes of such delight, 
You'll want to take a 
ramble 
Upon a 
starry night. 
A 
starry night for a 
ramble, & c. 
Some will choose a 
velocipede 
And others take a 
drive, 
And some will sit and mope at home 
Half dead and half alive. 
And some will choose a 
steamboat, 
And, others even fight, 
But I'll enjoy my ramble 
Upon a 
starry night. 
A 
starry night for a 
ramble, Lize.

Broken Down. 
49 
ONCE I'd money plenty, 
And friends, too, by the score; 
Then fortune smiled upon me, 
And no one passed my door. 
Now I'm poor and lonely, 
And not worth five cents, 
No one seems to know me— 
I'm completely broken down. 
Cnonus. 
I 
wander thro' the world, 
And meet with many a 
frown; 
No one seems to know me now, 
Because I'm broken down. 
With an ample fortune 
I 
went it rather fast, 
The pace was almost killing, 
And I 
found it couldn't last. 
Too proud to put the curb on, 
I 
thought myself high-bred 
But now for want of "bread" at times, 
I 
have to "fast" instead. 
The immortal Shakespeare 
Says: "All the world's a 
stage," 
And every man must "play his part," 
From childhood to old age; 
And when I 
think of days gone by 
How I 
was made the tool 
Of rogues and sharps, 'tis then I 
know 
" 
My part," has been " the fool." 
Friends could recognize me, 
When Poole he made my coat; 
But when I 
bad no "note t3 change," 
How soon they "changed their note I" 
An object sad and needy, 
I 
wander thro' the town, 
A living paroclos am I: 
"Hard up," yet "Broken Down." 
DARK AND ROLLING EYE. 
WE all do like the pretty girt* 
We see them day by day, 
And have at first sight fell in love, 
When ere they pass this way; 
A 
charming girl the other morn, 
I 
saw come passing by, 
And as I 
gazed, I 
found she had 
A 
dark and rolling eye. 
C
HORUS. 
But I 
never shall forget her, 
The first time that I 
met her. 
But when I 
looked, my fate was booked, 
I 
sealed it with a 
sigh, 
I 
found that I 
had fall'n in love 
With a 
dark and rolling eye. 
Hee dress was in the fashion cut, 
Tucked up so gay and neat, 
And when she wanted to cross the way, 
She showed her pretty feet; 
But then she dropped her handkerchief, 
It was marked "Lucy Y.;" 
I 
picked it up she thanked me 
With a 
dark and rolling eye. 
But I 
never shall, &c. 
Of course this little chance I 
took, 
We walked and talked awhile, 
She said, her father he twas rich, 
lie lately had struck ile; 
When I 
exclaimed, " Will you be mine ? "

DANCING ON THE BRAIN, 
SONG AND DANCE. 
OF all the nigs you ever see for dancing or for singing, 
Such a 
nig as me you never see to set the boards a-ringing; 
I 
go to balls and parties too, in moonlight snow or rain, 
I've got so fond of dancing that I've got dancing on the brain. 
CHORUS. 
You twist your heel and shake your toe, 
Now this is how you do it, 
(.31usic.) 
Everybody's getting it and none seem to complain, 
I 
reckon it's mighty pleasant to have dancing on the brain. 
There was a 
ball the other night, I 
got an invLation, 
I 
went and got my purtty's on with the greatest exultation; 
I 
was not dancing long, when I 
found it mighty plain, 
That all the gals was after me for dancing on the brain. 
You twist your, & C. 
Such a 
happy nig I 
do declare was never yet created, 
To dance and sing is my delight, and yet I'm celebrated; 
And how I 
got this dancing fit I 
never can explain, 
But I'll carve my way to glory, oh, with dancing on the brain. 
You twist your, & c.

My Polly Ann and me 
Was dressed to death-in all our best, 
So happy, light and free, 
When Pompey Smash, a 
colored moke, 
Came rushing in the hall, 
And swore that none could dance with Poll, 
There at the fancy ball. 
CHORUS. 
Strike up the fiddle, 
And let the banjo ring, 
Join in the chorus, 
While merrily we sing; 
Let all the darkeys quarrel, 
For I'm a 
happy darkey, 
All in this song and dance. 
My Polly Ann, she looked at me, 
And then she gave a 
sigh, 
While Pompey Smash, he shook his fist, 
With vengeance in his eye. 
I 
kissed my hand to Polly Ann, 
The leader gave a 
call, 
Away went Pompey with Polly Ann, 
The gayest of them all. 
Strike up the, &c. 
Soon Pompey and Polly were married, 
Pompey cleaned the gentlemen's clothes, 
While Polly shouted hot corn, 
Whar the summer breeze blows, 
But now they have retired, 
You will see them no more: 
For Pompey has made his fortune, 
And gone to Baltimore.

WAITING FOR A 
BROADWAY STAGE. 
AS up Broadway I 
strolled one day, 
To see the styles pass by, 
A 
pretty little girl I 
very soon met, 
And she had such a 
roguish eye; 
Her little short skirts in points hung down, 
For that style's all the rage; 
She was looking up mat down, with a 
pretty little frown, 
Waiting for a 
Broadway stage, oh ! 
Cuonus. 
She was just about the girl that's all the rage; 
Sweet sixteen was just her age; 
I 
met her on the cornet.; it was there that first I 
saw her, 
Waiting for a 
Broadway stage. 
She saw that I 
was looking at her, 
When a 
sweet little smile, like a 
beam, 
Just played round her face, and, with such ease and grace, 
Why, like an angel she did seem. 
But I 
kept getting like one in fear, 
For my heart felt like a 
bird that's in a 
cage; 
How I 
wished I'd never have seen that handsome little queen 
Waiting for a 
Broadway stage, oh ! 
She was just, &c. 
But as the ice was broken, my hat of course, I 
raised, 
As the stage, she required, soon came by; 
When she said hi tones so sweet, perhaps some time we'll meet 
As up the steps her little-form did fly. 
But I 
never since have seen her, so I 
wander in despair, 
For it seems that since she left me ' twas an age; 
But I 
never shall forget that little girl I 
met, 
Waiting for a 
Broadway stage, oh ! 
She was just, kc,

I've racers and hunters as well, 
Estates and lands in the country, 
So much money I

Then why should I

And neither spend money or lend, 
For money well spent brings joys, 
Yes money was made to spend.

FIFTEEN YEARS AGO. 
I've wandered through the village, Tom, and was singing 
merrily. 
When I 
was arrested and brought to jail that oft sheltere(/ 
you and me; 
But none were there to bail me out, at least they told mi 
so, 
For I 
wasn't acquainted with the judge, like fifteen yearr 
ago. 
The boys are at the same old game of stealing coffee and 
tea: 
They stole a 
ham the other night, you've done it oft with 
me; 
They're gambling still for money. Tom, at that baby game, 
keno, 
That dear old game we loved so well some fifteen years 
ago. 
And the old jail is altered some, ' tis larger now than then, 
The cells are much wider, Tom, to accommodate gentle-
men. 
But the bell is there that rang out when to the Island we 
must go, 
The music's just as sweet, dear Tom, as ' twas fifteen years 
ago. 
The river is running just as still, the willows on its side 
Fell over on a 
man, dear Tom, and yesterday he died; 
The grapevine, too, is ruined, Tom, where we had fun you 
know,

She's doing the grand in a

THE BIG SUNFLOWER. 
THERE is a 
charm I 
can't explain 
About a 
girl I've seen; 
My heart beats fast when she goes past, 
In a 
dark dress trimmed in green; 
Hei• eyes are bright as evening stars, 
So loving and so shy; 
And the folks all stop and look around, 
Whenever she goes by.

And I 
feel just as happy as a 
big sunflower, 
That nods and bends in the breezes, 
And my heart is as light as the wind that blows, 
The leaves from off the trees—zees. 
As days past on, and we became 
Like friends of olden times, 
I 
thought the question I 
would pop, 
And ask her to be mine; 
But the answer I 
received next day— 
How could she treat me so! 
Instead of being mine for life, 
She simply answered, no. 
And I 
feel just as happy, &c. 
I 
went next day, dressed in my best, 
This young girl for to see; 
To ask her if she would explain 
Why she had shaken me; 
She said she really felt quite sad, 
To cause me such distress, 
And when I 
said, " Wont you be mine ?" 
Of course she answered " yes." 
And I 
feel just as happy, ,kc.

You're all looking quite well;

A Beautiful Cloth Gilt Volume. 
Read what two leading New York papers say of it. 
The New 
York Evening Mail writes 
A 
little book has lately appeared in print at Messrs. Fisher & 
Denison's, 98 Nassau street, called " The Little Flirt." We 
cannot 
say that we recommend it to our young lady and gentlemen readers, 
as we think it would only encourage the bad, habit of "flirting." 
Unfortunately there is enough of it done without any further neces-
sity of explaining "how, when and where to do it," and this little 
volume would advise and initiate the uncorrupted in practising what 
is commonly called "flirting." 
The N. Y. Evening Telegram writes 
We 
have lately seen a 
neat little book, bound in morocco, costing 
25 cents, called "'The Little Flirt," published by Messrs. Fisher & 
Denison, 98 Nassau street. 
It gives information of the modus oper-
andi of flirting, and of the meaning of every motion of the hand-
kerchief, fan, glove and parasol. As there is nothing at all objec-
tionable in the volume, and its contents might afford some innocent 
amusement to many, we do not hesitate to recommend it to our 
young lady and gentlemen readers. 
The LrrTLE FLIRT contains Fourteen Silhouette Illus-
trations.

To those who have never perused the sad story of CILUILOTTB 
TEIEPLE, joyed with her in her early pleasures, sympathised and 
wept with her in her sorrows, a.ad glowed with indignation at the 
wrongs which she suffered from base, calculating villains, an oppor-
tunity is afforded of reading one of the most absorbing works ever 
written, proving " truth stranger than fiction." 
The poet's lines are but a 
just description of the unfortunate) 
Charlotte Temple: 
Her form was faultlesa, and her 
Untainted yet by art, 
WaS noble, just, humane and kind, 
And virtue warmed her heart. 
But, ah 1 
the cruel spoiler came--" - 
This book, in the language of Mrs. Rowson, " affords a 
striking 
example that vice, however prosperous in the beginning, in the 
end leads only to misery and shame.
