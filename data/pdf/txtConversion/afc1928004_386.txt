My heart is gladly beating, 
As I 
tread the scene once more, 
Where boyhood gayly revell'd 
In the happy days of yore ; 
And I 
greet the zephyr's melody 
That round me sweetly plays, 
For its tone is still as joyous 
As it was in early days. 
enont-s. 
My heart is gladly beating, 
As I 
tread the scene once more, 
Where boyhood gayly reve11'd 
In the happy days of yore. 
The fragrant breath of summer 
Would fan the boyish brow 
That, once so fair, by cruel care 
Is sadly altered now ; 
For the glossy raven tresses 
In which that brow was dress'd, 
Have faded, 'neath the hand of time, 
Into a 
snowy crest. 
My heart, etc. 
The green and waving meadows, 
The bed of fragrant thyme, 
The flowers fair, all seem to wear 
The dress of olden time ; 
The wavelets in the river 
Still seek their sunny track, 
And vanish like the golden hopes 
That never can come back. 
My heart, etc.

Though the world bath many sorrows, 
And perchance they may be ours; 
Love, from tears, a 
brightness borrows, 
Like the earth from summer show'rs. 
We will share our griefs and gladness 
In the future, as of yore; 
Awl in all our hours of sadness, 
Dearest, then I'll love you more. 
3. 
Youth may pass, but ask not, whether 
When you're old, I'll love as true? 
Shall we not grow old together, 
And time's changes mark me too ? 
Life may cease, but then, to heaven 
Will my pure affection soar; 
Yes. when freed from earthly leaven, 
Dearest, then I'll love you more. 
LOVE HAS EYES. 
Love's blind, they say,— 
o 
never, nay; 
Can words love's grace impart? 
The fancy weak 
The tongue may speak, 
But eyes alone the heart; 
In one soft look what language lies 
0 
yes, believe me, love has eyes. 
Love's wing'd, they cry-
0, never I 
On pinions love to soar. 
Deceivers rove, 
But never love; 
Attached, he roves no more. 
Can he have wings who never flies I 
Ah I 
yet, believe me, love has eyes.

My little darlings I 
will meet 
And kiss their faces bright.

You have never older grown— 
Since I

Music by W. H . 
BIIOOKWAT. 
LITTLE rosebud, are you lonely 
Now I 
am so far away 
For of you I'm thinking only, 
As I 
ever sadly stray ; 
Since from you I 
sweetly parted 
Earth has no delights for me, 
And I 
wander, heavy hearted, 
O'er the land and o'er the sea. 
CHORUS. 
Little rosebud, are you lonely 
Now I 
am so far away 
For of you I'm thinking only 
As I 
ever sadly stray-. 
Little rosebud, I 
am coming 
Home to see you once again; 
For I'm weary now of roaming, 
Drifting o'er the stormy main ; 
Will you welcome home the ranger 
To the sunshine of your smile'? 
Then shall sadness be a 
stranger, 
And life's sweetest joys beimile. 
Little rosebud, etc.

THEY bore him away when day had fled, 
And the storm was rolling high, 
And they laid.him down in his lonely bed, 
By the light of an angry sky; 
The lightning flash'd and the wild sea lashed 
The shore with its foaming waves; 
And the thunder pass'd on the rushing blast 
As it howl'd o'er the rover's grave, 
And the thunder pass'd on the rushing blast, 
As it howl'd o'er the rover's grave. 
No longer for him, like a 
fearless bird, 
Yon bark floats under the lee; 
No longer his voice on the gale is heard, 
When its guns peal over the sea; 
But near him the white gull builds on high 
her nest, by the el earn itiu WRY('

Price 10 cents, 
WHEN the sunbeams kiss the flowers, 
And the songbirds sing in glee, 
Making sweet the passing hours, 
Then my darling waits for me ; 
Little lov'd ones run to meet me, 
When from toils of day I 
come, 
At the door sweet smiles will greet me, 
AR 
I 
sing " God bless our home!" 
CHORUS. 
Bless our home, and all its treasures, 
Cheer our sorrows when they come, 
Bless its pure and simple pleasures, 
Evermore, " God bless our home!" 
When the gloomy night is falling, 
And my weary heart is sad, 
Sweetest voices then are calling, 
Making music pure and glad ; 
Oh, they charm away my sorrow, 
Smooth my path where'er I 
roam; 
Not one cloud can dim the morrow 
While I 
sing, " God bless our home 
I. 
71 
Bless our home, etc. 
There the dearest joys are biding, 
There is heav'n on earth for me; 
While the sands of life are gliding, 
Sweetest blessings there I 
see ; 
May those blessings live forever, 
Keep the wolf from out the door, 
Welcome be each friend, and never 
May our hearts forget the poor. 
Bless our home, etc.

Though our youth may pass unclouded, 
In a 
peaceful happy home; 
Yet, as year on year advances, 
Changes must, changes must upon us come; 
For the step will lose its lightness, 
And the hair be changed to gray; 
Eyes, once bright, give up their brightness, 
And the hopes of youth, the hopes of youth decay: 
When all these have pass'd upon me, 
And stern age has touch'd my brow, 
Will the change find you unchanging? 
Will you love me, will you love me then as now ?

THE MERRY MOUNTAIN HORN. 
Yes, I 
will leave the battle field, 
And seek again my native land: 
I'll cast aside my spear and shield, 
And join the merry mountain band. 
To roam o'er hill and valley green, 
I 
gaily rise at early dawn ; 
And listen to the echo wild, 
Of the merry mountain horn. 
I 
love to watch the rising sun, 
That gaily gilds the mountain brow, 
I 
love my home when toil is done 
And smiles that greet my quick return. 
To roam o'er hill and valley green, 
I 
gaily rise at early dawn; 
And listen to the echo wild, 
Of the merry mountain horn.

witb immense applause by TONY PASTOR. 
A 
TINT, pretty boy was seen 
To climb his father's knee, 
And kiss his brawny cheek and say, 
"Now papa, you kiss me." 
The father pressed his darling child, 
And smoothed his silken hair, 
And Willie murmured with a 
sigh, 
"I wish mamma was here!" 
CHORUS. 
wish mamma was here 
I 
wish mamma was here!" 
And Willie murmured with a 
sigh, 
"I wish mamma was here !" 
A 
tear rolled down the father's cheek, 
He pressed his pining boy, 
For her he loved had gone before, 
And Willie's end was nigh; 
fie bore him to his little cot, 
And dried the falling tear, 
ilnd Willie murmured in his sleep, 
"I wish mamma was here !" 
" 
I 
wislimamma,” ate. 
His darling pined that very night, 
Until the turn of tide, 
The angel death was near him then, 
At early dawn he died. 
The father cried in wild despair, 
" 
Oh! live, my darling dear !" 
And Willie breathed his last fend sigh, 
" 
I 
know mamma is here !" 
"I wish mamma," etc.

W HEN the songsters are returning 
From their southern sunny home, 
And the violets are blooming 
In the fields we used to roam; 
Will you promise then to meet me, 
With your loving kind caress, 
Tell me if you then will greet me; 
Blue-eyed darling, whisper yes. 
Will you promise, then, to meet me, 
With your loving, kind caress, 
Tell me if you then will greet me, 
Blue-eyed darling, whisper yes. 
When the bobolink is calling 
In the brushwood hedoes near, 
And the golden-breasted robin 
Sings his songs so loud and clear ; 
Will you meet me ' neath the maple, 
Where I 
tied your golden tress ; 
Say that you will surely greet me; 
Blue-eyed darling, whisper yes. 
Will you promise, etc. 
When the chickadee is peeping 
In the branches over head, 
And the blue- bird seems to listen

And your velvet hand I'd press, 
And your heart I'd have you give me;

WANDER'D to- day on the sea shore, 
The winds and the waves were low, 
And I 
thought of the days that are gone, Maud, 
Many long years ago; 
Ah 
those were the happiest days of all, Maud, 
Not a 
care nor a 
sorrow did we know, 
As we played on the white pebbled sand, Maud, 
Gathering up the shells from the shore. 
CHORUS. 
Gathering up the shells from the sea shore 
Gathering up the shells from the shore; 
.A.11 those were the happiest, days of all, Maud, 
Gathering up the shells from the shore. 
Oh, don't you remember the day, Maud, 
The last time we wander'd on the shore, 
Our hearts were so joyous and gay, Maud, 
For you promised to be mine evermore; 
Then the shells they were whiter than ever, 
And the bright waves were lovelier than before, 
The hours were but moments to us, Maud. 
Gathering up the shells from the shore. 
Gathering up the shells, etc. 
But now we are growing up in years, Maud, 
Our locks are all silver'd and gray, 
Yet the vows that we made on the shore, Maud, 
Are fresh in our mem'ries to- day; 
There still is a 
charm in those bright shells 
And the sound of the deep ocean's roar, 
For they call back the days that we spent, Maud, 
Gathering up the shells from the shore. 
Gathering up the shells, ete.

And the violets show their blue-, 
I 
will greet my cherished treasure 
With a 
song of love that's true ; 
Then repeat the loving stories 
That so often have been told, 
While I 
steal the sweetest kisses 
Where the sunbeams drop their gold.

And the breezes sigh again, 
I 
will tell you fondest, fairest, 
How your heart I

And your tiny hand I'll hold, 
While I

The clock is striking in the belfry tow'r, 
And warns us of the ever fleeting hour; 
But neither heeds the time which onward glides, 
For time may pass away, but love abides.

If we must part, Ah! why should it be now ? 
Is this a 
dream? &c. 
THE SMILE THAT PLAYS. 
The smile that plays on woman's cheek, 
The sigh which breaks her rest, 
Though bright or sad, but ill bespeak 
The feelings of her breast; 
They may some anxious thoughts impart, 
But those who've most relied, 
Know not the love of woman's heart, 
Until that heart be tried. 
There may, in her uncertain smile, 
Some token be of grief, 
Some impulse which may, for awhile, 
In sorrow seek relief : 
But those who most have watched the part 
Portray'd by hope or pride, 
Know least the love of woman's heart 
Until that heart be tried.

THE VILLAGE BLACKSMITH. 
Words by II . 
W . 
LONGFELLOW. 
Music by W. H. Weiss. 
Under a 
spro, cling chestnut tree 
The village smithy stands: 
The smith, a 
mighty man is he, 
With large and sinewy hiaids, 
And the muself s 
of his brawny arms 
Are strong as iron bands. 
H is hair is crisp, and black and long; 
His face is like the tan ; 
His brow i 
wet with hone t 
sweat, 
He earns whate'e he edit, 
And looks the whole world in the face, 
For he owes not any man. 
Week in, week out, from morn ' till ugh, 
You can hear his bel ows blo ; 
You can hear him swing his heavy sledge; 
With m asured be..t and slow, 
Like a 
sexton ringing th 
village bell 
When evening sun is low. 
And children coming home from school 
Look in at the oven door— 
They love to see the flaning forge 
And hear the bellows roar, 
And catch the sparks that fly 
Like chaff from from a 
threshing foot, 
lie goes on Sun& y 
to the church, 
And s'ts amongst his boys ; 
He hears the par,on pray and preach; 
He hears his daughter's voice 
Singing in the village choir, 
And it makes his heart rejoice ; 
It sound3 to him lite her mother's voice 
Singing in Paradise ; 
Ile needs must think of her ° Lee more, 
how in the grave she lies, 
And with h 
s ard r.Aigh hand he wii:ee 
A 
tear from out his eyes. 
Toiling. rejoicing, sorrowing, 
Onward through life he goes: 
Each morning s. es some task begun, 
Each evening se 
it, close; 
Something attempted, sernething dote, 
Has eArned a 
night's repose. 
Thanks, thanks to thee, my worthy fr en, 
For the lesson thou hast aught; 
Thus at the flaming forge of life, 
0.1r fortunes must be wrought; 
Thus, on its sounding £
111V ,1 
shaped 
Each burning deed each thought.

KIND mother, dear, the hour has come

Dear mother, be has vowed to me 
That I

And tenderly we'll wander through 
Our short uncertain life; 
So, mother, stop your sobbing, do? 
And cease those bitter tears ; 
Come, let me kiss your lips again,. 
And drive away your fears. 
Good-bye, etc. 
The home is in a 
distant land 
That he has made for me, 
'Tie ' monast the golden orange groves 
Away beyond the sea; 
I've promised that I'd meet him there, 
So mother, dry your eyes, 
For I 
must see ray anxious love 
'Neath bright Italian skies. 
Good-bye, eta.

HOW DEAR TO ME THE HOUR. 
By THOMAS Moorm. 
how dear to me the hour when daylight dios„ 
And sunbeams melt along the silent sea; 
For then sweet dreams of other days arise, 
And mem'ry breathes her vesper sigh to thee. 
And, as I 
watch the line of light that plays 
Along the smooth wave tow'rd the burning west, 
I 
long to tread that golden path of rays. 
And think 'twould lead to some bright isle of rest.

W HEN the birds awake the morning 
With their twitter in the trees, 
And the silver dew is shining 
On the daisy dotted leas; 
When the brilliant sun is rising 
O'er the emerald- coated hill, 
When the brooklet weaves its carol, 
I 
am thinking of thee still. 
CHORUS. 
Thinking, thinking thinking of thee still ; 
When the brilliant sun is shining 
O'er the em'rald-coated hill, 
When the brooklet weaves its carol, 
I 
am thinking of thee still. 
When the mid- day zephyrs murmur 
Thro' the forest branches high, 
And the lilies of the valley 
Seem to breathe a 
gentle sigh; 
When the roses shed their plumage 
Near my vacant window sill, 
When the busy bees are humming, 
I 
am thinking of thee still. 
Thinking, etc. 
When the twilight gray is falling 
O'er the path we used to roam, 
And the di'mond stars are peeping 
Down upon my cottage home; 
When a melody bewitching 
Rises from the meadow rill, 
When I 
leave for realms of slumber 
I 
am thinking of thee still.

I'm getting old and feeble now, I 
cannot work no mare; 
I've laid de rusty-bladed hoe to rest; 
Ole massa an' ole miss's am dead, dey're sleepin' side by side; 
Deir spirits now are roaming wid de blest ! 
De scene am changed about de place, de darkies am all gone; 
I'll nebber hear dem singing in de cane, 
And I'se de only one dat's left wid dis ole dog ob mine, 
In de little old log cabin in de lane. 
CHORUS. 
De 
chimney's falling down an' de roof is cavin' in; 
I 
ain't got long round here to remain; 
But de angels watches over me when I 
lays down to sleep 
In de little old log cabin in de lane. 
Dar was a 
happy time to me, ' twas many years ago, 
When de darkies used to gather round de door; 
When dey used to dance an' sing at night I 
played the old banjo. 
But alas, I 
cannot play it any more. 
De hinges dey got rusted an' de door has tumbled down, 
And de roof lets in de sunshine an' de rain, 
An' de only friend I've got now is dis good ole dog ob mine, 
In de little old log cabin in de lane. 
De chimney's falling down, eta, 
De foot- path now is covered o'er dat led us round de hill, 
And de fences all are going to decay, 
An' de creek is all dried up where we used to go to mill ; 
De time has turned its course anodder way ; 
But I 
ain't got long to stay here, an' what little time I 
get 
I'll try and be contented to remain, 
Till death shall call my dog an' me to find a 
better home 
'Jan dat little old log cabin in de lane.

CLOSE your eyes, my little rosebud, 
Lay your hand upon your breast, 
It is time, my pretty darling, 
Now to tuck you in your nest; 
Oe the perch your birdie's sleeping, 
He will call you when it's light, 
And around your pillow, darling, 
Angels whisper sweet good night. 
CHORUS. 
On the perch your birdie's sleeping, 
He will call you when it's light, 
And around your pillow, darling, 
Angels whisper sweet good night. 
With the break of early morning 
You will hear the birdie sing, 
He will raise the head that's nestled 
Underneath his golden wing. 
With a 
trill that is enchanting, 
He'll awake you from repose, 
For the faintest rays of daylight 
Rouse him from his quiet doze. 
On the perch, etc. 
Thet. adown the dewy meadow 
You can trip with joy and glee, 
And awaken from their slumbers 
Yellow butterfly and bee ; 
They will all be glad to meet you 
In the sunshine warm and bright, 
So, my little darling, kiss me, 
While the angels say good night. 
On the perch, etc.

W HERE THE WATER LILIES GROW." 
Music by AIITEURR PERCY. 
Published by Wm. A. POND & Co, 547 Broadway, New York. 
'TWAS in the pleasant summer time. I 
met him all by chance. 
The robins sang their sweetest rhyme, and loving was his 
glance; 
We wander'd mid the blooming flow'rs, he called me sweet and 
fair, 
The queen of all the sunny bow'rs, the brightest rose-bud 
there. 
SPOKEN.—Oh, he was charming—such a 
delightful little fel-
low! I 
never can forget— 
CHORUS. 
When we met there by the river, 
In the sunlight's merry glow ; 
For my heart he won forever, 
Where the pretty little water lilies grow. 
I 
dream of him where'er I 
go, I 
never can forget 
Those eyes that shone with sparkling glow, the day when first 
we met ; 
The lilies all will fade and die, the birds will fly away, 
We can't forget, nor he nor I, the love was told that day. 
SPOKEN.—No! 
For he begged me just to whisper the little 
" 
Yes." 
When we met, etc.

Published by KINKEL BROS., St Louis. 
'Tis years since I 
left my home, the one I 
loved so dear, 
Where in my youth kind parents lived my weary heart to 
cheer; 
Now all those days are pass'd and gone, and I 
am from them 
still, 
lint while I 
live I'll not forget the cot upon the hill. 
CHORUS. 
The cot upon the hill, where friends are living still ; 
That pleasant little love- birth place, the cot upon the hill, 
That pleasant little love- birth place, the cot upon the hill. 
'Twas in that cosey little cot I 
passed my younger days, 
With friends and others always by, to cheer my childish ways ; 
But now that I 
am far away, I 
often wonder still 
If those kind friends would welcome me, to the cot upon the 
hill.

So to comfort and to cheer me, 
Sing the old songs once again. 
CHORUS. 
Softly, sweetly sing the old songs, 
Sing them, darling, once again,

Wand'ring down sweet mem'ry's lane. 
Softly sing the old songs, darling, 
They were always dear to me, 
I 
can hear each simple measure, 
Sweet as ever sweet can be ; 
What a 
vision floats before me 
Of those hours so free from pain ; 
While the magic spell lies o'er me, 
Sing the old songs once again. 
Softly, sweetly, etc. 
Softly sing the old songs, darling, 
In the twilight sweet and low, 
Bring me back the golden moments,

Soon they'll pass away for ever, 
Like the reaping of the grain ; 
Kiss me, love, and leave me never I 
Sing the old songs once again.

WANDE1tSft'S DREAM. 
I'vE been thinking of thee, mother, all this long, long rummer 
day, 
For last night I 
dreamed I 
met you, in car old house far awv, 
And methought you smiled upon me, u you used to itc of." yore, 
And, mother, I 
was happy then, but that sweet dream is o'er ; 
My father's welcome, too, '
twas sweet; his words were soft and 
mild, 
Just as they used to sound to me when I 
was but a 
child ; 
I 
pressed his hand within mine own, its clasp was warm and 
true; 
And, mother, I 
was happy then, with father dear, and you. 
My sister's lips I 
pressed to mine, and clasped her to my heart, 
I
-
 • And she murmured softly in mine ear, " we never more must 
part 
She told me she had lonely been, and often wept for me, 
As she feared the wayward wanderer she never more might see; 
And last, my brother's welcome, his love had ne'er grown cold ; 
He pressed me to his throbbing heart, as he'd often done of 
old ; 
He told rue I 
was strongly grown, since I 
crossed the stormy 
main, . 
But, mother, if my form is changed, my heart is still the same. 
Then methought I 
stole away and sought the garden fair, 
Where blossomed many a 
fragrant flower, of beauty rich 0.nd 
rare, 
Then down beneath the orchard trees, where oft a 
child I 
played, 
Once more I 
sat upon the grass beneath the pear tree's shade ; 
Then, with a 
smile upon my brow, I 
sought the homestead fair, 
Lightly I 
bounded through the door; hush! ' twas the voice of 
prayer; 
My father read the holy page, oh! how lifelike it seemed; 
And mother , then it was I 
woke. and found I 
bad but dreamed.

That I

bird that is weary, 
Oh, come to your Norah so trua I 
Linger not long, for the days they are weary, 
While Norah is dreaming of you. I 
Still I 
am waiting, etc.

those who weep and sigh; 
For to keep a 
good heart is a 
brave man's part, So " nev - er 
say die," but " try." 
Some men will be poor, and be jolly too, 
While others with riches will pine; 
So which are the richer by far of the two 
Is not very hard to divine. 
Though " keep up your courage" is common, perhaps, 
'Tis not very far from the truth, 
For you can't make a 
man out of one of those chaps, 
Who lets his heart fail in his youth.— Cho. 
The hill we've to climb we must climb in our prime, 
Or else we shan't do it at all; 
For there's an old gentleman, called Father Time, 
'Will give the go-by to us all ; 
So let us be happy, as long as we may, 
Until we have troubles, and then 
Let us meet them, and beat them, completely defeat,. them, 
And conquer like resolute men.— Cho. 
Then never give way, nor put off for a 
day 
A 
task you once have begun; 
But work with a 
will, and don't leave it until 
You find that your object is won; 
For Providence watches your struggles, and Imows 
Your heart has been brave in the fight; 
And you'll find from the autumn of life to the close 
Your days will be peaceful and bright.—.-Co.

HE DOETH ALL THINGS WELL. 
I 
REMEMBER how I 
loved her, when, a 
little guileless child, 
I 
saw her in the cradle, as she looked on me and smiled; 
My cup of happiness was full—my joy words cannot tell, 
And I 
blessed the glorious Giver, who " doeth all things well." 
Months passed—that bud of promise was unfolding every hour; 
I 
thought that earth had never smiled upon a 
fairer flower ; 
So beautiful it well might grace the bowers where angels dwell, 
And waft its fragrance to His throne, who " doeth all things 
well." 
Years fled—that little sister then was dear as life to me, 
And woke in my unconscious heart a 
wild idolatry ; 
I 
worshipped at an earthly shrine, lured by some magiespell, 
Forgetful of the praise of Him, who " doeth all things well." 
She was the lovely star whose light around my pathway shone, 
Amid this darksome vale of tears, through which I 
journey on; 
Its radiance had obscured the light which round his throne 
(loth dwell ; 
And I 
wandered far away from him, who " doeth all things 
well." 
The star went down in beauty, yet it smiletti sweetly now 
In the bright and dazzling coronet that decks the Saviour's 
brow; 
She bowed to the Destroyer, whose shafts none may repel, 
But we know, for God bath told us " He doeth all things well." 
I 
remember well my sorrow, as I 
stood beside her bed, 
And my deep and heartfelt anguish when they told Inc she was 
dead ; 
And 0, that cup of bitterness! let not my heart rebel 
OW gave, He took, He will restore, " He doeth all things well."

once I 
was dear ! 
Then, thy heart stired and flusli'd thy brow,

Now thy hand lies listless in mine, 
Once its replies spake love divine! 
Cold as if we never had met ; 
Can it then be hearts can forget'? 
Ah, speak to me, speak ! 
Be my heart bard, 
Or will it break for one poor word? 
No vow to bind, no pledge, I

Only be kind! speak, to me, speak—speak! 
One idle day thou did'st deplore, 
Some castaway on desert shore ; 
'Twas but a

Yet thou did'st pale, silent and pained, 
And thou did'st moan ; sad, sad to be 
Utterly lone by the bleak sea! 
My life is drear, I

Give me the tear thou shed'st that day!

So the Laird may marry the Lady, 
The Lady of high degree, 
And jewels so fair she may twine in her hair, 
They are better for her than me; 
And gaily I'll dance at the bridal, 
I'll merrily dance on the lea, 
With Susan, and Alice, and Emma, 
But Donald shall dance with me! 
And I 
will marry, 
So the Laird he married the Lady, 
The Lady of high degree, 
And the lowland lassie he lov'd so well 
Abode in her own country; 
For oh ! where would my heart be, 
Was ever her constant cry, 
If ever I'd dared to marry the Laird ° 
Why, Donald would surely die! 
So I

SWEET ROSE OF YARROW 
The morning broke in blushes o'er me, 
As up in the sunny hill I 
strayed; 
beauteous girl I 
saw before me. 
And thus I 
spoke the lovely maid : 
Sweet maid, and whither (lost thou rove ? 
Thine eye is Cupid's piercing arrow, 
Thy name I 
prithee tell me, love ?' 
She said, 
They call me Rose of Yarrow.' 
'Be mine, dear maid, and fondly I'll cherish 
Those blooming charms have won my heart, 
For sooner, dearest, would I 
perish, 
Than any pang to thee impart.' 
She blush'd consent: the village peal 
Rang for our nuptials on the morrow, 
And bless'd contented do I 
feel, 
l'ossess'd of her, sweet Rose of Yarrow.

THE MONEYLESS MAN. 
Ry linxrry STANTON. 
Is there no place on the face of the earth 
Where charity dwelleth, where virtue has birth! 
Where bosoms in kindness and mercy will heave, 
And the poor and the wretched shall ask and receive 1 
Is there no place on earth where a 
knock from the poor 
Will bring a 
kind angel to open the door ? 
Ah! search the wide world wherever you can, 
There is no open door for the rnoneyless man. 
Go look in the hall where the chandelier light 
Drives off with its splendor the darkness of night ; 
Where the rich hanging velvet., in shadowy fold, 
Sweeps gracefully down with its trimmings of gold, 
And mirrors of silver take up and renew 
In long lighted vistas the ' wilderina view ; 
Go there in your patches,and find if you can 
A welcoming smile for the monayless man. 
Go look in your church of the cloud-reaching spire, 
Which gives back to the sun his same look of fire, 
Where the arches and columns are gorgeous within, 
And the walls seem as pure as a 
soul without sin ; 
Go down the long aisle—see the rich and the great, 
In the pomp and the pride of their worldly estate ; 
Walk down in your patches, and find if you can, 
Who opens a 
pew for a 
moneyless man. 
Go to your judges, in dark flowing gown, 
With the scales wherein law layeth quietly down; 
Where he frowns on the weak and smiles on the strong, 
And punishes right while he justifies wrong; 
Where jurors their lips on the Bible have laid, 
To render a 
verdict they've already made; 
Go there in the court- room, and find if you can, 
Any law for the case of a 
tuoneyless man. 
Go look in the banks, where Mammon has told 
His hundreds and thousands of silver and gold ; 
Where, safe from the hands of the starving and poor, 
Lie piles upon piles of the glittering ore; 
Walk up to the counter—and there you may stay, 
Till your limbs have grow old and your hair turns gray, 
And you' ll find at the bank not one of the clan 
With money to lend to a 
moneyless man.

TUE MONEYLESS MAN.—Concluded. 
Then go to your hovel !—no raven has fed 
The wife who has suffered so long for her bread; 
Kneel down by her pallet and kiss the death frost 
From the lips of the angel your poverty lost— 
Then turn in your agony upward to God, 
And bless while it smites you, the chastening rod; 
And you'll find at the end of your life's little span, 
There's a 
welcome above for the moneyless man. 
JANE AND JEREMIAH. 
I'VE come this evening to complain 
Of the treatment of a 
girl call'd. Jane, 
With eyes and hair as brown as a 
nut, 
Whose business place it was in the Cut ., 
Penny ices there she sold, 
But like her trade her heart it was cold, 
Her each night I 
hear in a 
dream 
Cry, " Letn.on ice, raspberry or cream!" 
• 
CHORUS. • 
I 
never shall forget that girl 
Whom all the chaps admire, 
Nor yet the names and little games 
Of Jane and Jeremiah! 
She used to drive a 
roaring trade, 
And in the ice line money made, 
She turned theca out so very nice, 
I 
lived on nothing else but ice; 
But on this fare I 
grew so thin, 
That I 
was merely bone and skin, 
And after all she told me fiat, 
She liked a 
fellow short and fat. 
I 
never shall, etas, 
She said that in the summer days, 
The ice line is a 
trade that pays, 
But in the winter, when it's cold, 
There's very little to be sold. 
She met a 
man called Jeremiah, 
Who kept a 
brazier full of fire, 
And who dealt, in the winter time, 
In baked chestnuts and elder wine. 
I 
never shall, eta.

OLD TIMES ROCKS. 
Old Black Joe."

Friends that I

Bent is dis form and all snow-white am dose locks, 
And still my heart. is dreaming of dew old times rocks 1

I'm sighing, yes, sighing, 
As de past around me flocks; 
Me heart's forever thinking of dew old times rocks 
Gone is my home ' way down in Tennessee; 
There I 
was gay and happy as could be. 
Grief conies along and at my door it knocks, 
I 
never more shall see again dew old times rocks. 
I'm sighing, etc. 
Where is de stream by my little cabin door ? 
Where are de birds that I 
never hear no more ? 
New times hab come, but my grief de y 
only mocks, 
I'm weeping for de happy scenes of old times rocks. 
I'm sighing, etc. 
Once I 
was young, wid de banjo by ni; side ; 
Now, I've no friend in dis weary world so wide; 
Tears sadly fall as sweet mem'ry's gate unlocks, 
It makes me young again to sing of old times rocks. 
I'm sighing, etc. 
Sweet were the days when we darkeys used to sing, 
Den light and gay how we made the banjo ring ! 
Children dey danced as eunnine as de fox, 
Ah, clew was just de good old times, clew old times rocks. 
I'm sighing, etc. 
Old friends are gone dat used to greet me here, 
Old faces pat that once to me were dear: 
Death's at de door, and berry soon he knocks ; 
So, darkeys, let's hab de dance of old times rocks I 
Pin sighing, qt.c.

Hold the fort with firm endeavor, 
When you're in the right !

On the road of life! 
Be a

A SKETCH FOR ONE CHARACTER. 
[Scene, a cottage. 
As the curtain rises the symphony of the 
tong is played vcry softly.] 
[Enter enAnr-Es; he looks inquiringly around him, and 
when he .Me3 the cottage expresses delight.] 
CHARLES.—'Tis the place at last! 
Oh, what a flood of 
pleasant memories rush upon me at this moment. 
There's 
the little garden where so often we have walked in happier 
days. 
Yonder is the green, shady lane, and the little white 
church on the hill. 
There is her window; and far away 
see the soft glimmer of the stream, by which we used to stray 
and dream of the bright future that we deemed was in store 
for us. 
I 
wonder if she has forgotten me? They say that ab-
sence conquers love, and I 
have been away over the sea for the 
last five years. 
How well I 
remember the little parlor where 
we used to sit and chat in the lovely twilight. 
Then those lily 
fingers of he 
us s*i to fly over the strings of her harp, as she 
woke the sweet strains that I 
never can forget while life shall 
last. 
There seems to be no one at home. 
Even the birds are 
quiet. 
What would I 
not give to hear that touch upon the 
harp once more. 
It would tell me that I 
was not forgotten. 
[The symphony of the song is again played. CHARLES Caln.14 
forward and sings.] 
Just touch the harp gently, my pretty Louise, 
And sing me the songs that I 
love; 
They will call back the days when together we sat 
On the porch 'neath the nest of the dove. 
There was one that you sang, my pretty Louise, 
It brings fond recollections to me ; 
You remember the mocking-bird mimicked it once, 
As it perched on the sycamore tree. 
Just touch the harp gently, my pretty Louise, 
Just touch the harp gently, Louise, etc.

[After the let verse is sung, the strain is taken up by a 
voice 
behind the scenes. 
CHARLES listens attentively.] 
I'll touch the harp gently, your loving Louise, 
And sing the old songs that you love; 
They'll recall the bright days when we played in the wood, 
And watched the birds flitting above. 
For each song that she sang, your pretty Louise, 
E'en now she remembers them well, 
For though we've been parted, they've lived in her heart, 
And sweet is the love that they tell! 
[The song is taken up by both yokes.] 
HE. 
Just touch the harp gently, my pretty Louise, 
Just touch the harp gently, Louise. 
Oh, touch the harp gently, my pretty Louise, 
And sing the old songs that I

On the porch ' ne_ath the nest of

No father, no mother, and no where to go, 
left a 
poor orphan, a 
burden of woe ; 
From morn until night I 
am roaming the street, 
But dare not appeal to the strangers I 
meet, 
The nicely dressed ladies all pass in their pride, 
And shrink from my garments when I'm by their side 
The gentlemen jostle and knock me about, 
And stylish young Misses' trip by with a 
pout. 
CHORUS. 
No father, no mother, and nowhere to go, 
I'm left a 
poor orphan, a 
burden of woe ; 
From morn until night I 
am roaming the street, 
And dare not appeal to the strangers I 
meet. 
No father, no mother, and nothing to wear, 
I 
am a 
sad picture, an object of care ; 
While day after day f 
go hungry and sore, 
But will not appear at the wealthy one's door. 
The servants are chilly, and look with a 
frown, 
They tell me there's plenty of work in the town 
The landlady orders me back to the street, 
And this is the pity they throw at my feet. 
No father, no mother, et 
No father, no mother, no shelter for me, 
I 
am a 
poor outcast—oh, Nrhy should it he I 
From dawn until dark I 
am trampina in vain, 
But none will give aer to my alymish and pain. 
The people are heartless, and charity's blind! 
But there is an Eden I 
hope soon to find ; 
The needy are welcome, the weary find rest. 
Oh I 
may I 
soon enter that home of the blest. 
No father, no mother, etc.

With no children left you there,

Do you miss the many faces, 
Miss their love- kiss on thy brow, 
Loving hearts and warm embraces, 
Is the old home lonely now 7 
CHORUS. 
Is the old home lonely, mother 
Lonely to you night and day ? 
With your children, one another, 
Wandering so far away. 
Mother, is the old home lonely, 
With no voices hush'd in pray'r, 
And no little footsteps only 
Making music errywhere 7 
Happy hea-Fts that lived to cheer you, 
And your cup of bliss tc 
They may never linger near you. 
Is the old home lonely now ? 
Is the old home, ete. 
Mother, is the old home lonely, 
As you think of other days, 
When kind hearts around thee only 
Linger'd still to speak thy praise! 
You are growing old and weary, 
Marks of sorrow on your brow; 
And the days must be so dreary.
