day long they talk like baby.She's his jelly-elly-roll,He's her sugar-ugar-boy.That's the way they bill
and coo,Pookie boo, pookie boo, pookie boo.All night long he calls her snooky-oo-kums, snooky-oo-
kums;All day long their neighbors shout,Cut-it-out, cut-it-out,They cry,for goodness sakeDon't keep
us all awakeWith your snooky-ooky-ooky baby talk.
