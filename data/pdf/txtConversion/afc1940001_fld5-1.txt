of course)
4244
AslanianNote for record 66M.Note on A 1, Camels' caravan.
Afer playing the pieces on [57M?] Mr. Aslanian asked me not to record for a while because they
were going to play something to please and amuse themselves. Apparently the recording was a
grant strain to them and they were a little self-conscious and stiff about it, and they did not work
[?] playing faster and faster and louder and louder as Eastern orchestras usually do. Once they had
gotten that off their chest they decided to entertain themselves on Sunday afternoon, this being
the way they usually spend Sunday afternoon, at Mr. H.'s house anyhow. So they set to. I had not
stopped the motor and let the machine go on running and when they got all through I raised the
needlehead and they realised I had been making a record. I laughed and they were very amused
although they seemed to fear that that wasn't crikcet, but they decided they didn't mind when they
found it made a pretty good record anyhow. And they said that sounds really very much better
than when we took so much care with it. I was interested in making the first records to notice that
whenever in the first records I tried to bring the violin out above the other instruments, so as to
follow the melody more clearly; they protested as they considered that the record sounded better
when you heard fully as much of the other instruments that is the oude and the kanoon as you did
of the violin accompaniment and the clarinet that were laying the melody in unison. It was not at all
as I would have balanced the record of course, as I was foolishly thinking in terms of transcribing the
melody, but to them apparently all the parts were equally important.
Another thing I should have said about Aslanian's orchestra is that it is often invited to other cities,
for inst. to San Jose and San Francisco, and [Turlook?] and Modesto, and all up and down the San
Joaquin Valley, where there are a great many Armenians of course, to play for weddings and funerals
AFCCC-FLD5-1 http://www.loc.gov/resource/afc1940001.afc1940001_fld5-1
and dances generally. There are a good many dances out in the country I am informed, at places
like Foler and Sanger where the Armenians still do circle dances, the round dances. It is interesting
also to note that in recording these pieces in which the voice comes in occasionally, the feeling of the
singer is much like that of the people who shout out in American Square Dance bands occasionally.
They do not feel that the voice should be [reeninent?], but [it?] that it should be one of a whole group
of instruments. Therefore, when I tried to bring out the voice in the interests of transcribing, that is
always objected to.
4245
Note for record 67M.More notes on Aslanian's Armenian orchestra.
Mr. Aslanian is playing the violin as a substitute for the kemancha and he uses the oriental
tune usual with the kemancha. I will give the tuning of the four main strings and then the four
sympathetic strings, taken from left to right as you face the instrument, [?????] B-flat -F- (below
middle C),[?] F, B-flat, E-flat; add B, E-flat, B-flat, E-flat for the sympathetic strings.
Since this recording was made Mr. Aslanian told me that he put sympathetic strings on his violin
to make it sound like the kemancha because in Aloppo once he ran across a man who had such
an arrangement. So he fixed up his violin this way and when Mr. Haroutunian built a kemancha in
this country he added the four sympathetic strings to it too. As nearly as I can make out [theyis?]
don't gras the relation between the sympathetic strings and the main strings; they just consider
that having the sympathetic strings increases the volume, which in a sense is of course a fact, when
sympathetic strings are / properly tuned, but in this case nobody seems to have any convictions
about how the sympathetic strings should be tuned.
This orchestra seems to have been organized and kept going by Mr Aslanian and certainly he is the
most active spirit in it. It plays at times at the [Ararat?] Cafe in Fresno. Mr. Martin's [Ararat?] Cafe
to a place where I am told a poor man can get something to eat now and again even if he does not
have any way of paying for his meals. But aside from that it is obviously a great Armenian resort,
not like the Omar Kayam Restaurant, which is an expensive place, where the wealthy Armenians
and other people go, but a quiet place where very good and very inexpensive Armenian food is
served. Mr. Aslanian and Mr. Haroutunian used to play in the old country and they stand almost in
the relation of adopted son and father; they are very devoted friends. Mr. Takakjian is about their
age but apparently did not know them till they were all together in this country. Mr. Krotlian was
AFCCC-FLD5-1 http://www.loc.gov/resource/afc1940001.afc1940001_fld5-1
born in Turkey but left at the age of 13 to come to the US. He learned to play thee the oude after he
came to America.Conclusion of note from beginning of 68M.
Aslanian and Haratounian have played together for [?] 25 years or more. They played together in the
old country.1954 - Note on Martin's Ararat Cafe, which was like a small Cafeteria, which had an outer
room for checker and card players upstairs, across from the Hotel Hughes. After Mr. Martin's death
his daughter and son-in-law moved across the street to run the Hotel Hughes Restaurant with a large
counter and a few tables, very American and no longer so cheap as the Ararat nor so welcoming
to oldsters and checker players, but which served the best Armenian food in Fresno until the hotel
burned in 1953.

music that is not pure Armenian, but most Armenians enjoy the Armeno-Turkish music very much.

The best kemancha player in US died in Fresno a year or two ago; Mr. H. takes great pride in his
kanoon playing for which he is famous all up and down the San Joaquin Valley, but he says he is no
good on the kemancha. Instruments everywhere in the Haroutunian house: under the bed behind
the closet on a top shelf on the back porch - some are not in condition to play, like the sag, which is a
true Armenian instrument but Mr. Haroutunian has not strung it because he does not know how it is

Palyed by Mr. Haroutunian.B 1 Tuning of kanoon - complete scale. 23 strings (plus 1 missing).As
above, giving alteration produced by bridges. In one or two instances he forgot to play the open
string, so tuning is not complete. Quarter tones at some points in the scale but most of the intervals
are larger.This does not give the modes he uses, of course, but only the pitches from which the notes
of a mode may by chosen. The mode is often "altered slightly at certain points" duing a piece, or it
may be completely changed to a different mode for part of a piece - all by means of the little bridges.

Information on the [?] Kanoon from Mr. Haroutunian, Fresno, Calif., April 1939. Transcribed from
record 65M.
It should be mentioned that the notes produced on the open strings and the notes produced by
these bridges/ which alter the tones have nothing at all to do with the actual scale used. There
are a number of scales. Mr. H. said somewhere up in the seventies - a number of possible scales
- a number of possible arrangements of bridges which create a scale on this instrument. He of
course does not use all of them by a long shot, nor does he set the bridges in one way and retain
that scale all the way through. Here is a good deal of thematic alteration and also a good deal of
modulation of a [?] kind between sections of most of the pieces that he plays. He told me that it
was only the very old pieces that you could play in the same way, that is with the same tune from
beginning to end.This is a record made by Mr. Bedros Haroutunian, 264 M Street, Fresno, Calif.
April 22, 1949.I want to express my appreciation to Mr. H. who knows the music of his people
thoroughly and has been a great help in searching out old instruments and helping me to study
them.A propos of the orchestra of which Mr. H. is a part, Mr. Aslanian told me that they can play in
five languages, that is to say Armenian, Turkish, Greek, and Arabian music, and American jazz. They
speak of Turkish music as the jazz of the Near East, incidentally 62MArmeninMr. T. Shatinian, 254 N

AFCCC-FLD5-1 http://www.loc.gov/resource/afc1940001.afc1940001_fld5-1
like South Uist Gaelic according to [Hebrides?] Islanders here,[??] Telling me about the song entitled
'the Coopers' which she said was written in 1871, she recorded te following:
"Well, this man has worked with building barrels. Well, they call that, the man that builds barrels like
that, they call his the cooper, you know. And that's the way this man got the song. And he says: (she
sings in Gaelic to a tune that I recorded from the millers in August '53 on Cape Breton Island)
She sang several verses and then stopped with a sigh: "Ah know no, I have no more!"
Question by S. R.: What's the story of the song.
Answer: "This fellow started this song - he started to make - you are the man building his barrels and
I start the song - to make a song about it - and they say when he would go over to sell the barrels
to Baddeck he'd buy - he had a sister, an old maid, and her name was Mary, and when he'd go over
to sell the barrels he'd buy molasses and sugar and calico dresses for Mary, before she'd get old on
them, before she'd be an old maid, you know, to dress her up - and then they'd say the merchant
that was over in Baddeck, keeping the stores, his name was Colin Campbell, when he'd come over,
he'd have a bill for this man to pay the things and owe, all the....
SR: Those most be things that really happened?
Mrs. McD: " [?] Oh yes, right there!
SR: Was there really a merchant by that name, do you suppose
Mrs. McD: "Oh yes, I [knowd?] them and went to their store and everything. And I know the [ecaper?],
the man that is was building the barrels. He was only a little ways from us.
SR: Well,... Heaven's sakes.
Mrs. McD: "And we called them -- we always called them -- Now we don't know what their real name
was, but on account of them building these barrels, they were called the Coopers, you know. 2 Note
on record 69M, cont'd(Mr. [McD.?] sings a couple of lines in Gaelic and then explains in English):
"And they'd go over across the water, you know, and these was the men that kept the store."
SR: How long ago was that? Would you have any idea what year that was?
Mrs. McD.: "it (Pause while she thinks) ... It was in '71, I think.
AFCCC-FLD5-1 http://www.loc.gov/resource/afc1940001.afc1940001_fld5-1
SR: That's the year my mother was born.
Mrs. McD.: "Yes? ... 'twas about '71, for I was married / in '72."
SR: And when did you come out here?
Mrs. McD.: "In '75. And I had two children then. We came to stay in San Francisco. But my husband
had the asthma and he could not stay there and then I had another baby before I left there and then
we went to Nevada -- I had six children there -- then I am 35 years in this house here.
SR: Tell me about those songs. When somebody made up a song like that Mrs. McDonald, they made
up the words, somebody there [?] make up the words, but where did they get the tune.
Mrs. McD.: "They took a tune from another song. Now, for instance, this book here, now the woman,
the composer, I know her too, the woman that composed the songs that's here. She never went to
school, she didn't have one word of schooling, she never went inside a schoolhouse. There was lots
of people there[.?] like that."
SR: Yes I am sure, but they were not ignorant, for that.
Mrs. McD.: "No, and I [?] some of them that run a store, and they never went to school, no,
but this woman, that composed this [?] songs song,[?????] [?????] she never, I know her, when

extremely intricate rhyme schemes -- Certain of the most difficult types of rima make sense recited
either forward or backwards, syllable by syllable. In the "Golden Age" men spoke to one another
in verse, and these verse forms are still used in improvisation among contemporary Icelanders.

Rimur do not require the effort singing nor the monotony of changing - that man is best at kvetha
who performs most effortlessly. Mr. Bardarson has great reputation as a kyithamathur. Usually the
group accompanies the leader softly and holds the last tone of each stanza for him so he can get
his breath and rest an instant.Each singer has his favorite tune for a given form of rima, though he
may know many others and will change tunes in the middle of a story to correspond with the spirit
of each part of the narrative: romance, battle, contemplation, triumph, despair.Some of the rimur
are a translation into Icelandic of novels from France and of a period 800 (? !!) years ago, according
to Leo Bardarson.101M101MA 1 Rimur. Sung by Sigurd Bardarson and son Leo, as above.B 1 Rimur.

present, who crushed an egg shell in his hand voer the head of the eldest Spanish ladies. It was all
very dignified; eggshells were never thrown! See article by Mrs. Antoinette Little in Monterey Herald
about December 1939. Rowdies were ushered out by the elder gentlemen - there was never any
