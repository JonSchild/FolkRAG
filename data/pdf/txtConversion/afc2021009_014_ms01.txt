CH 00:03
Good evening and thank you so much for agreeing to take part in this historical Archie Green Folklife
Occupations Project with the Library of Congress. How are you doing this evening?
BH
I'm doing quite well.
CH
Wonderful. Will you give us your complete name and your year of birth?
BH
Barbara Jones Hatcher. Year of birth, 1945.
CH
Where were you born?
BH
I was born in Waterbury, Connecticut.
CH
Where do you reside now?
BH
I reside in Washington, D.C.
CH
Tell us about your family dynamic.
BH
My family dynamic? You mean, like, composition? So, my family was made up of my mother, father,
and I had two sisters. One sister died young and so, at this point, I have one sister who is alive.
CH
Have you ever been married? Have any children?
BH
I’ve been married but never had children. I was married once.
CH
Once was enough [laughing]. Okay. Who or what inspired you to become a nurse?
BH
Well, I think what inspired me was the Cherry Ames books. When I was a child, we got books every
Christmas and I got the Cherry Ames series and my sister got-- I can't remember. That person was like a
teacher or something. I can't remember the name of her series. So, that's how I thought about becoming a
nurse, because Cherry Ames was everything – Cherry Ames: Visiting Nurse, Cherry Ames: Surgical
3
afc2021009_014
Nurse, Cherry Ames, you know. It went on and on and on. In fact, a couple of years ago, I purchased the
whole series again because I had lost, you know, the original books, so I purchased them all again. So,
that's why, and Cherry Ames was always doing something different, you know. She was not a nurse like
people think of nurses. She was always doing something different. My parents thought I would be a
history teacher but I became a nurse [chuckles].
CH
Because of Cherry Ames [laughs].
BH
Largely because of that, even though I loved history. That's why they thought I would become a history
teacher.
CH
Your educational journey. Share that with us.
BH 3:46
Well, I went to undergrad school at the University of Connecticut. That also was something that my
parents said. If I became a nurse, I had to go to a collegiate school, and at the time I was going, they
were just starting. I think only one historically Black university had a bachelor's program. It was in the
south and my father said I couldn't go. I think it was in Alabama. He said, "No, I couldn't go to
Alabama,” so I wound up at University of Connecticut.
CH
Were there a lot of Black students there?
BH
No.
CH
What was that like?
BH
In my class, was I the only one? Well, actually, we started out with two of us, but the other person in my
particular class, she failed pharmacology. At the time I went, you had to get a B in pharmacology and if
you didn't, you failed out of the nursing school. I mean, there was no-- at that time where you could
retake courses and all that. You were just--
CH
Finished.
BH
Finished. I remember all of us crying, ‘cause there were a number of us. We worked with her and
worked with her and worked with her. I think she got a high C. She just, you know, about missed it, but
it was like, that was it. Also with UConn, the first two years were all your, like, required courses and we
started the clinical the summer after your sophomore year, and that's why if you didn't pass
4
afc2021009_014
pharmacology, you could not go to clinical. So, I was the only one in my class. I think there was one
person in the class ahead of me. She would have been a junior and then a senior. How was it? You know,
in the nursing school, I didn't feel anything. In the University of Connecticut, when I was in stores, I
mean, there was probably-- I doubt there were 10 Black people on the whole campus, so it was kind of
different, you know. For the most part, people didn't bother you, but I had one incident, and that was my
sophomore year. In the morning, every morning when I went to wash up and shower, there was a white
girl who would come in the bathroom and yell, "Nigger! Nigger! Nigger!" [both laugh]. Finally, I told
her I was not tolerating it anymore and all that and I would hurt her [both laugh]. I said, “I’m not
tolerating this,” and all of a sudden, she got afraid, you know, and I ran around the bathroom and she ran
out screaming and yelling like I had touched her. But anyway, calling me, "Nigger, nigger, nigger." So,
anyway, I did get-- Well, we both got in trouble, but I got in trouble. She stopped, ‘cause I went
downstairs and told the House Mother that what had occurred and what I had done, and I wasn't going to
tolerate it anymore. So, that kind of-- She said, "You're both, whatever. You have to be in certain times
for a week or 10 days," or whatever it was, but she never bothered me.
CH
What about your instructors? How do you feel they treated you?
BH
For the most part fine, and in fact, some of them, like the History of Nursing teacher, O.B. teacher,
actually, those people wanted you to succeed, and so I never really felt in the nursing program a lot of
racism.
CH
What about on the fine art side?
BH
Fine arts?
CH
Psychology, sociology, English.
BH
No, not undergrad. No, no. Number one, we had these big lecture classes, you know, with the
psychology and sociology. They didn’t halfway know who was in there ‘cause there were hundreds of
students, so those instructors were wild [inaudible 10:06] [both laugh]. They were kinda screwy, but,
you know, so no, I never really felt it, except for those instances on the campus.
CH
And in the dorm.
BH
In the dorm, no, not-- Oh yes! That incident. Actually, that was the only incident I ever had with a
person, a white person, my whole time in school. You know, people may have had feelings, but they
never expressed them or, you know, bothered you about it.
5
afc2021009_014
CH
Let's talk about your graduate education.
BH 10:58
Okay, my master's was in public health at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Okay, I guess
I went the time when they were attempting to get more minority students, so actually didn't really have
problems in the School of Public Health. Now, North Carolina was another point [both chuckle]. When I
went there, I found an apartment. I stayed in what was called Carrboro, North Carolina. Then, because I
didn't have a car, often, particularly if it was late in the afternoon or evening, I would call a cab. There
was a cab company there, but it was a Black-owned cab company. If I called them, they came like that,
‘cause they said they were concerned about me being out in Carrboro in an apartment by myself,
because whether I knew it or not, Black people didn’t live in Carrboro. So, I said, “Well, you know, I go
home, close my door, blah, blah, blah,” so they said, “Wherever you need to go, anywhere, you just call
and we will come and make sure you get to and from wherever you need to go.” I never really had an
incident, but most of the people in that particular apartment were students or graduate students, so
people didn't really bother with you at all. Again, the only time when I felt any racism and stuff is when
we did clinicals or went outside the school environment. I wanted to get my PhD. No, I’ll start with one
incident. We had to do a clinical at the Public Health Department in Chapel Hill and, again, there was
one other Black person. She was like Alabama and Mississippi, but she would tell you there's no such
thing as racism, but anyway, you know. I was kind of a militant. I told you when the revolution coming.
I think I [inaudible 14:16] [both laugh]. Anyway, we went to, like, this orientation and we're sitting there
and the Health Department director was a physician, came to staff meeting to tell the nurses to go full
steam ahead on this family planning and get rid of some of these nigger babies.
CH
Wow.
BH
And, you know, he knew well we were sitting there, but that was his philosophy. So, there were little
scattered things, but in terms of school, no, I never really felt that I was being treated differently than
any other students. But of course, they had a lot of foreign students as well so, you know, I guess the
school was a little more attuned to having people who were different than the majority. Again, we did a
summer clinical in-- What's that by the water in North Carolina? Oh gosh. I can't think of it, but it's
down on the water. And, of course, the school rented a house on the beach for all the students doing the
clinical there. I was friends with a nun who came from Baltimore. She was a nun that didn't wear the
habit so, you know, people not did not know. We went out to swim one day. There were people on the
beach and we got out there, Joanne said, “Good morning,” to the people on the beach [chuckles]. “My
name is Joanne and this is my sister, Barbara, and we have the same father”. Well, of course she was a
nun and that’s why she was saying that but those people didn't know that. They looked up at her
[inaudible 17:20]. My father said, “The only way you get away with that is because you're a woman.
You all need to, you know, just need to stop.” I said, “I didn’t say anything. I just went out on the
beach,” and Joanne told them, “Well, thank you for giving us the whole beach” [both laugh]. [inaudible
17:46] leave. I mean, those kinds of incidents, but I also didn't stay in North Carolina to work, so I can't
say what opportunities you did or did not have to succeed. Really wanted to do my PhD in Sociology
there, but the head of that department said that women needed to go home and have babies.
6
afc2021009_014
CH
A lot of biases.
BH
You know, so he didn't believe a woman--
CH
It was a gender bias.
BH
Needed a PhD. “Number one: You’re already getting a master’s. Isn’t that enough?” “No!” “You don't
need a PhD,” so, anyway. I mean, there were racial things going on, because they weren't paying some
of the staff, the staff that cleaned the rounds and kept up the dormitories and cooked the food, so we did
some picketing on behalf of those people to get better salaries. At that time, they would break up your
picketing and you could get jail. I was always afraid if I got jailed, my father would absolutely kill me
for even being out there, but anyway.
CH
Where did you go to do your doctoral work?
BH
My doctoral work I did at George Mason, so that was later in my career. I went to the doctoral program
there while working full-time, you know.
CH
What was your concentration?
BH
My concentration was Nursing Administration in Health Policy.
CH
Tell us about your nursing career.
BH 20:11
My career. One thing, I started off my career at Waterbury Hospital in Waterbury, Connecticut. I was the
only nurse in the whole hospital with a bachelor's degree, because Waterbury Hospital had a School of
Nursing, so most of the nurses there were Waterbury Hospital graduates. I worked on a med surg floor. It
was a 45-bed med surg floor. Think it was forty-five. When I started, I worked three to 11 ‘cause I didn't
want to rotate, you know, days and nights and all that, so I just did permanent evenings. I was there
about, maybe at the most, two weeks when they told me that I was charge nurse because I had a
bachelor's degree, and since people with a bachelor's degree were supposed to be so smart, then I was
charge on three to 11. I never had enough-- Every night I worked in that hospital, there were two of us
on that floor – me and a nursing aide.
CH
No!
7
afc2021009_014
BH
Me and a nursing aide. By the time I gave meds, it was time to give, you know, the next round of meds. I
never, ever saw the cafeteria. I couldn't tell you where the cafeteria was, ‘cause she and I would eat after
we fed the patients and got them to sleep. We’d be back there eating crackers and maybe getting coffee
or tea, you know, that we could warm up in the kitchen. I never had a meal.
CH
The other units were staffed that way as well?
BH
Not to my knowledge, no. Not necessarily.
CH
They had adequate staff.
BH
Well, I don't know in those days if people were adequately staffed, but they certainly had more than one
nurse. I was like, “What is this? What if I kill somebody because I’m here trying to get all this done?”
People had to have their dressing changes ‘cause it was a surgical floor and all that nonsense. So, I left.
CH
How long were you there?
BH
I worked there for about four months and then that's when I came to D.C. and became a public health
nurse, a visiting nurse. That just ended it for me for hospital nursing, ‘cause I just thought that was, like,
that was poor care to people and if somebody dies, then you have to say, “What [inaudible 23:50].”
CH
[Inaudible 23:52] safe.
BH
You know, what did I miss?
CH
Management never saw a problem with that?
BH
No, no. They thought it was alright ‘cause I was a bachelor's nurse, you know. I was smart, you know. I
was supposed to-- So, it was, like, a dig at me for having a bachelor's degree and everybody else were
three-year graduates.
CH
Diploma. After you did public health nursing, what did you do after that?
8
afc2021009_014
BH
After visiting nursing?
CH
Mmhmm.
BH
After visiting nursing, that's when I went back and did my master's, and once I finished that, I came back
to Children's Hospital and I became their public health nurse coordinator and I helped with the discharge
planning for patients and making sure if those that needed nursing services, the nursing care, they got
referred, picked up by someone and seen in the hospital. I also did work for the hospital administrator. I
shouldn't say “for”, but with him in doing his sudden infant death studies. So, I would go into the home
studies patients, families, that had died when they were doing the initial research on SIDS, trying to find
out what the cause-- what was causing SIDS and all that. Then, you know, was involved with all the
planning for the new hospital. Also became the chief of their Children and Youth Project. They had a
federal project, so I was over that, and we had two clinics that provided primary care to primarily infant
to about 18, 17 or 18. In Adams Morgan, we did have a teen pregnancy program, and I was responsible
for the teen pregnancy program at Adams Morgan. I actually did that before I became the Chief Nurse
and was overall--
CH
You were the chief nurse at Children's Hospital?
BH
For the C & Y Project.
CH
Ok, just for that project. You mentioned new hospital. That was a new hospital for children, hospital in
Washington, D.C.?
BH
‘Cause I started out at the old hospital when it was on 13th Street and then, you know, nursing had a big
role in designing--
CH
Okay. It’s a beautiful building.
BH
That hospital. When we transferred there, I became the Chief for Nursing, outpatient nursing, all
outpatient nursing at Children's.
CH
Did you write policies?
9
afc2021009_014
BH
Yes. Some, yeah. I mean, it was all a team approach there so, I mean, the policy and all that came from
the nursing office and you were involved, given whatever expertise you had. So, I would be more
involved with outpatient policy and the emergency room policy than inpatient policies.
CH
Where did your journey go after being an administrator?
BH 28:20
After that, I went to the D.C. government. I was assistant project director for a prenatal program,
prenatal postpartum program that worked not as much directly with women but with other services to try
to establish the appropriate services for women to make sure they got the most appropriate prenatal care.
It was very political, you know, very political with people wanting the money but not, you know. What
was happening to women, you did not-- you were not always certain.
CH
They were not really concerned about the actual care of the women.
BH
I mean, people would say they were but they were not and so, you know, we really wound up in the
politics of-- in the competition between the hospitals, like how [inaudible 29:57] in G.W. and
Georgetown, and because we were a federal program with money, everybody wanted the money and
control, so, you know, it was--
CH
It was difficult. Were most of the patients from the lower socio-economical areas?
BH
Oh yeah.
CH
And those hospitals were vying for them to become their consumers.
BH
At that time, they were vying more to be in control of what they thought was adequate prenatal care.
They wanted more the control of it than--
CH
Than the quality.
BH
The two hospitals that really saw more patients were G.W. and Columbia Hospital for Women was still
open then. So, Columbia started seeing more people, but there was still the disparities with poor women
trying to get to Columbia or anywhere else. Of course, D.C. General was open and, to them, D.C.
General was the bottom of the Earth and, you know, Howard was probably one step above. That's the
way they felt so, like I said, we dealt primarily with the politics of that issue and trying to get the Mayor
10
afc2021009_014
and the City Council to pass the kind of legislation and provide the insurance options that would really
help people get the services they wanted.
CH
Were you successful in your advocacy for that?
BH
Yes, I think we did some good. You know, of course, you never can change everything. We made people
more aware. There was a little bit more coordination, but you couldn't change everything. I mean, even
our own health department was a problem, because at the time, they didn't want to change either, you
know. They had provided prenatal care in a certain way for years and it was like, “Well, like, who the
heck do you all think you are coming in and telling us how we ought to change services?” I've really
done a little bit everything, but then I went to social service side, became chief nurse out at Forest Haven
with the mentally retarded, but we also had juveniles that were incarcerated out there. That was a trip,
because when I got there, they were just transferring to having LPN’s and RN’s, because the aides on
units gave all the medication.
CH
Unsafe.
BH
Can you believe it? Then, you know, we had to-- What was that company? ASCO. We worked with
them to set up where patients, they couldn’t have stopped medicine, so you could only give the
prescribed and the patient got their pills whatever time--
CH
Work safety.
BH
Huh?
CH
Work safety.
BH
Yeah, and, you know, we even had carts, but most of the aides that had given these medications for years
hated us. They absolutely hated us ‘cause they were used to if X was acting out, they’d just pop some
pills on him or her. They get them to cool out. So, that was a whole educational process to try to get
back, to change. We, you know, we did get something done there. We did have to go on the other side
and we did take care of those juveniles over there, because we had a nurse over there and they got their
meds, or if they got sick, we had a small hospital, and so anyone on the campus that got sick, if they
could be maintained out there, they went to the hospital, or they may have gone to another hospital and
they came back to recuperate or they were reassigned back to their unit they went to the hospital. I
mean, that was an experience, and as one staff person told me, ‘cause I was sitting in her home ‘cause
she was drunk, was like, “Barbara, baby. I seen ‘em come and I seen ‘em go.”
11
afc2021009_014
CH
Oh, talking about administrators?
BH
Uh huh. “And I will see you go too,” and I said “but you are going home and that is for sure.” This man,
he had been in, I think, the Navy or like a corpsman or something. He was really very good except when
he got drunk. So, you know, you knew on pay Friday that he was gonna come in at three o'clock drunk
as a skunk. You could depend upon that and he would harass the nurses. I finally one day called him to
my office and I told him-- You couldn't do anything with him. He was a [inaudible 37:50], and if you
tried to discipline him, nothing ever went through. So, I had to go to him, “If you touch another nurse, I
have this friend,” who I didn’t have, “that does not like sexual harassment and I will report you to him
and you don't know who will sneak up on you the next time you’re drunk,” and he said, “Are you
threatening me?” I said, “Yeah,” so he went back to the unit and said, “Miss Hatcher’s threatened me.”
People said, “Miss Hatcher threatened you? Oh, you’re full of it.” People asked me, “Did you threaten
him?” I said, “No,” [both laugh]. What was so funny, the man went and got into Alcoholics Anonymous.
CH
That was a good thing. You scared him straight. That was a scare-straight tactic.
BH
Next thing I know, they said, “I don’t know what you did, but he went to Alcoholics Anonymous.”
CH
It was good for him.
BH
I said, “[inaudible 39:12], because as long as you not drinkin’, you a good worker. You good with the
clients. It doesn't make any sense.” Then, after that, what did I do? I went to the mental retardation
administration as a special assistant, and that was doing, you know, city-wide kind of stuff in some of
the policies and all that related to taking care of retarded and developmentally disabled in the
community.
CH
How long have you been a nurse?
BH
I guess going on 55 years.
CH
When did you get into education?
BH 40:22
I got into education after I left doing global public health. National--
CH
Let’s backup to the global public health. Tell us about that.
12
afc2021009_014
BH
Okay, well I’ll back up. So anyway, after I left [inaudible 40:41] and all of that, I did go to the first, what
would you call it, the first insurance program for children with special needs, and so we planned to pay
for all their services from a variety of pediatricians, etcetera.
CH
This was in Washington, D.C.
BH
It was in Washington, D.C. It was among the first of its kind in the nation, and in D.C. was definitely the
first one that just dealt with special needs children. That one I left because we got laid off ‘cause of some
funding stuff. I then went to the American Public Health Association and I worked to do-- I was over
Scientific Affairs, so we did the policies for the whole organization. Policies normally came from
members, but every year at the annual meeting, they had policy statements that they passed, so my job
was to work with, alongside my staff, the Science-- it was called The Science Committee, to make sure
the policies were correct, you know, and state of the art and etcetera, etcetera. So, we did a lot of that
policy kind of work, developed several programs like traffic safety. We worked with NHTSA to do
traffic safety programing, maternal and child health, to do a maternal and child health education program
where we brought people in from across the country that weren't maternal and child health [inaudible
43:24] for some education. I then became what's called the Secretary General for the World Federation
of Public Health Associations.
CH
Is that a federal government agency?
BH
No, it was under APHA.
CH
Which is a private company?
BH
Private, yeah, but the World Federation was made up of the state or country health departments across
the world. At that time, the main office was located at APHA. That's when I did a lot of traveling to the
various countries, working with them to kind of develop their organizations and look at their
programming. Also helped organize two world congresses before I left. I was the first nurse, the first
Black and, of course, there was some people, one or two people, that didn’t like it [inaudible 44:59]
other than that. And worked with the World Health Organization, because we were a recognized
organization for the World Health, so every year, we went to the World Health Organization and
participated in their events and also some of the policy making for the World Health.
CH
That must have been exciting.
BH 45:32
It was. It was. It was. Then, after that, that's when I left APHA and I started to teach.
13
afc2021009_014
CH
Where did you teach?
BH
At George Mason.
CH
That's in what part?
BH
Fairfax.
CH
Fairfax, Virginia. What did you teach?
BH
Well, I taught Health Policy, Health Administration primarily.
CH
Was that for undergraduate or graduates?
BH
No, graduates.
CH
So, you primarily taught on the graduate level?
BH
Yeah, doctorate, DNP and PhD students.
CH
What makes a successful graduate student, in your opinion?
BH
A successful graduate student. Well, I mean, most graduate students are independent thinkers. They're
organized, you know, and they kind of have in mind where they want to go with their career and you're
trying to help shape them and give them the kind of information that they need to be successful whatever
they wind up being, executive or whatever. So, I mean, you have to be self-directed to me to be a
graduate student, and in this day and age, most graduate students are kinda working and going to school,
so you have to be kinda organized and committed to doing what you want to do.
CH
What kind of challenges did you see that the graduate students faced?
14
afc2021009_014
BH
You know, what did they face? I just felt that, at least where I taught, and more so for the DNP’s, we
were training a lot of people for primary care whose experience was all hospital and, therefore, trying to
help them see that you can't view patients that you're going to care for in the community like they’re a
visitor to your hospital, you know. You got so used to this visitor kind of thing that people have in
hospitals that you really have to see people in a different way.
CH
In a holistic manner. You have to treat the whole person, which includes family a lot of times.
BH
And the policy, you know. I don't know. I think I did a good job, because I required them to do certain
projects. I required them to attend trainings and events that would help them see another perspective,
you know. You know, I made these folks go into Washington D.C. and go over the river. This all kind
of--
CH
Get the urban experience.
BH
Yeah. It’s not just the urban experience. It's all these things that are available, you know, the trains at
NIH or all these other places that had stuff. I think most students felt that I pushed them in the right
direction and, of course, you know, I did do-- A few of the students, I was their advisor on their projects
and helped them get their dissertation or DNP study done.
CH
You're also an entrepreneur.
BH
Yeah.
CH
What type of business do you have?
BH
A consulting business, and most of it’s related to organizational development and some health equity.
CH
Can you tell us a little bit more about the health equity side of it?
BH
Okay, the health equity primarily has been more related to maternal and child health and making sure
people are designing efforts that get into equity. It's fair for all women, all people. In this case, most are
women, in getting the kinds of services they need and working with hospitals or other organizations to
look at their programming and how they can make it more equitable, particularly for minority women
and poor, or so poor minority women, just minority women. Until the pandemic, I did some work in
15
afc2021009_014
Africa helping public health organizations set up, you know, get their structure, their organization, but
since the pandemic, I haven't done that. Can't travel.
CH
Chi Eta Phi Sorority Incorporated.
BH
Oh boy.
CH
How long have you been a member?
BH 52:11
Since 1983.
CH
What chapter and region are you a part of?
BH
I’m part of the eastern region and Alpha chapter.
CH
Okay, Alpha chapter. Have you held any offices on the local, regional or national levels?
BH
Locally, I was what we call the Tamiochus, which is more the-- I'm trying to think of it in lay terms. It's
the financial person that accepts the money and records the money. So, I've been that. I've been over
several committees. What are we calling it now when we bring in people? They changed the term.
CH
The Dean of Membership.
BH
Membership, yeah. So, I've been the Dean of Membership. I've been over a number of committees. Used
to be on the Finance Committee, would help with the awards, awards committee and on and on.
Regionally, I was the treasurer for the region for about seven years, and nationally, I used to be the
editor-in-chief for Chi Eta Phi’s publications.
CH
Service for humanity. How do you think Chi Eta Phi Sorority Incorporated impacts humanity?
BH
Well, I think at the local level, we impact humanity at variety of ways, including some of our programs
related to blood pressure screening, in helping people stay well, in promoting health fairs and providing
education, whether it's in schools, nursing homes, etcetera. We also, I mean, more of late, we help fund

efforts that certainly help a lot of people, like the Kidney Foundation, childhood cancer. So, I think we
help in a variety of ways, making the world a little bit better for people.
CH
What advice would you give someone who's considering becoming a DNP, going to graduate school for
nursing?
BH
Again, I think you have to be clear on what you want to be. Most DNP’s now, even though you don't
have to be, so, I mean, do you want to be in administration or do you want to be a clinical person? So,
you have to be clear on that, to me. I think it has to be something that you want to do, not just to get a
DNP, because you have to put a lot of time and effort in providing services to people, and most DNP’s
now are nurse practitioners so, I mean, you’re a primary care provider and you have to want to do that
kind of work and be willing to put up with those things that go along with providing primary care, but
most importantly, becoming involved in making sure nursing can practice in a way they want to practice,
you know, and practice independently and not have all the restraints that might be placed on nurses by
the medical community. So, I mean, that's another area where nurses really have to become politically
aware of what impacts your practice and what impacts your patients from a policy standpoint. I think a
DNP gets into that much more actively than, say, a nurse in a hospital.
CH
I call us “regular practice” and “advanced practice” nurses. Any words of wisdom for service for
humanity?
BH
Service for humanity, I really think you have to go beyond just feeding yourself and feeding populations,
and that means really looking at making sure services are reaching the population. Whatever population
you decide to serve, I think you should be making a impact on that area. So, if we take childhood cancer,
it’s not just giving the money or seeing a child, it is helping the policy and programs develop that you
know will best serve that group of patients, but it can be any group.
CH
So, to really make an impact, a real inroad impact.
BH
Yeah, and it’s not just one and done or whatever. It’s continuous.
CH
To have a vested interest. Well, I thank you so much, Dr. Hatcher.
BH
Well, I hope it was useful.
CH
For being a part of this very important project. I have a confession to make to you. You are my private
mentor [laughs].

BH
Private mentor.
CH
You’re my secret mentor. I’m your secret mentee, I should say, and I really appreciate you taking your
time out as we are here at the Live Hotel and Casino in Maryland for the 70th Northeast Regional
Conference and Workshops. So, thank you so much.
BH
Okay. You’re welcome.
