INTRODUCTION
 
This report examines the feasibility of developing a major touring exhibit
 
including visual and performing folk arts.
 It is based on two site visits and
 
conversations with nineteen people related to three different forms of
 
transportation that could be used for such a tour.
 Case studies concerning
 
train, truck, and barge exhibits are included along with an evaluation of each
 
mode of touring.
 In addition, a rationale for undertaking such a project and
 
recommendations for future action are included.
 
I want to thank all the people who shared their time and knowledge with me for
 
making this report possible.  The subject is an interesting and challenging
 
one, and I think they all enjoyed talking about it as much as I did.  The most
 
pleasant surprise of all was that everyone responded positively to the idea of
 
presenting folk arts and artists from throughout the country by means of a
 
touring exhibit.  The general interest for such a project seems to be present.

EXHIBIT RATIONALE
 
The successful implementation of state folk arts programs in the past ten
 
years, across the United States, has led to a dramatic increase in the
 
public's awareness and interest in traditional arts throughout the country.
 
While this cultural resource has long been present, it is only in relatively
 
recent times that the wonderful scope and variety of folk arts and artists has
 
been properly presented to public audiences.  Excellent, and nationally
 
recognized, events such as the Festival of American Folklife, National Folk
 
Festival, and the National Heritage Fellowship Awards have played an important
 
role in this awakening while playing to primarily the same regional audience
 
each year.
 
The time seems right to develop a major touring exhibit, featuring both visual
 
and performing folk arts, that can travel to communities of all sizes in a
 
mobile celebration of human creativity within cultural traditions.
 
There are many advantages to such a tour.
 First and foremost, artists and
 
their work will receive greater exposure to the public and press both in their
 
home region and in other parts of the country.  A high quality exhibit, both
 
educational and entertaining, and presented with flair, will draw attention to
 
individual state folk arts programs at each stop.  A successful tour will gain
 
high press visibility and will reach many new people who have yet to discover,
 
understand, and appreciate the world of traditional art.
 The tour can stop at
 
localities that otherwise would not be able to share in major national
 
exhibits.
 
-3-
Probable residual benefits would include increased interest and support of
 
existing programs, and stimulation of private sector financial support.  A
 
tour such as this would also serve as a catalyst for interstate cooperation
 
between folk arts programs.

THE ARTRAIN IN MICHIGAN
 
Based on a meeting with Jim Tottis, of ARTRAIN Staff, July 1
,  1
985, Detroit,
 
Michigan, and a site visit to Holland, Michigan on July 2
,  1985.
 
The ARTRAIN,  formerly the Michigan Art Train, is based in Detroit, Michigan
 
and is the result of an idea conceived in 1968.
 The original cars for this
 
project were donated to the project from the 1976 American Freedom Train.  The
 
Michigan Art Train began rolling in 1971 and now travels outside the state as
 
well.
 
The primary concept of the ARTRAIN is to take a variety of art exhibits, each
 
with an individual theme, to towns and small cities throughout the state of
 
Michigan, and beyond, thus providing quality visual art presentations in parts
 
of the state that otherwise would have little or no exposure to such exhibits.
 
The train does include large Metropolitan areas as well while maintaining its
 
primary goal of serving smaller constituencies.
 
According to ARTRAIN literature, they have visited 300 communities in
 
twenty-five states with a total viewing audience of over two million since
 
1971.
 Of that total, over half have been school-aged children on educational
 
field-trips.
 It is the only art museum touring throughout the country via the
 
rail system and has been administered by its own non- profit corporation since
 
1975.
 
-5-
The stated goals of the ARTRAIN are "to take fine art to the people and to
 
serve as a catalyst for arts education and community arts development."  A
 
"Teacher's Aid to Creative Artraining", approximately seventy pages in length,
 
is published and made available to teachers who bring their classes to the
 
exhibit.
 It contains a number of valuable sections and is designed to be used
 
before the visit to the exhibit in order to enable viewers to best take
 
advantage of the time spent at the ARTRAIN.
 It includes a comprehensive list
 
of pre-visit coaching, classroom activities, descriptions of the various
 
components, inter-disciplinary activities, suggested listening and reading,
 
and a guide for creating a "classroom museum".  Also included is a two page
 
evaluation form for teachers to fill out after their visit which asks them to
 
evaluate as GOOD/ADEQUATE/POOR all people, materials, presentation, and
 
exhibit content.  A take-away student booklet is also made available to all
 
visitors.
 (The cost of the Teacher's Aid to Creative Artraining is made
 
possible in part by a grant from The W.K. Kellogg Foundation which funds
 
educational projects.)
 
ARTRAIN COMPONENTS
 
(The exhibition I viewed was titled "THE MUSIC OF ART" and focused on music
 
and musicians in visual art and the artistic aspects of musical instruments
 
from the Baroque era.
 Each tour has a new theme they borrow from some of the
 
nation's "foremost" private and public art collections.)
 
(In total,  the ARTRAIN consists of four cars and one caboose with no means of
 
self- locomotion.
 It is 375' in length.)
 
-6-
The first segment of the exhibition is a computerized, four screen, audio-
visual presentation introducing the Baroque era which lasts approximately ten
 
minutes.
 The visual and audio were both of high quality and this format
 
provided an exciting prologue for the exhibition.
 (The children viewing
 
during my visit were mostly from Mexican families that were in the area as
 
seasonal migrant field workers.)  The amount of interpretive, musical, and
 
visual information that can be delivered by this medium is impressive and is
 
well suited to the small confines of a train car.
 
The next component is the first of three "galleries" and features exhibit
 
cases containing musical instruments.
 It is at this point, as the observer
 
begins to weave through the small channel between the cases, that the
 
narrowness of the train car begins to make an impression.  A valiant attempt
 
to disguise the cramped quarters is made by the use of mirrors on the walls to
 
give the impression of more space.
 (The exhibit content was a disappointment.
 
Of the approximately twenty instruments on display, not one was an original.
 
On top of that, the copies were not made by the best contemporary makers.  The
 
exhibit also failed to mention that there is a large movement in the music
 
world back to the use of period instruments.)
 
The next two galleries housed various two- and three-dimensional art pieces
 
based on musical themes.
 (These were all original pieces and of high
 
quality.)  These areas did not feel as "closed in" as the gallery with large
 
exhibit cases and were therefore relatively more comfortable to be in.
 
At the end of the third gallery (and third train car) is a small museum retail
 
shop selling souvenir items such as buttons, mugs,  t-shirts, hats, etc. priced
 
-7-
from $
.50 to $6.00.  Exhibition catalogues, exhibit guide books, and other
 
publications are also available.  This area has not been a financial success.
 
At its best, it has "almost broken even".
 
The fourth and final area is "The Studio Car".  This is the area presenting
 
two working artists and it is the most popular section of the exhibit.
 One
 
artist is part of the tour package (always a potter working at a wheel) and
 
the other is someone chosen by the local presenting committee who in this case
 
was a painter.
 (At one point they even had a working kiln in the car until it
 
burned through part of the car.)
 
The concept of having actual working artists to watch and talk to at the end
 
of the exhibit is a good one, however, I found it odd that neither of the two
 
artists were working with a medium or subject that had anything to do with the
 
content or subject of the entire exhibit.
 The ARTRAIN position on this is
 
that "the potters wheel is always a hit" and that the second artist is always
 
chosen by local organizers regardless of their genre.
 This is definitely an
 
area that could use some re-evaluation.
 
Viewers exit the ARTRAIN from the Studio Car.  There are two wheelchair lifts,
 
one at the entrance and one at the exit.
 
PROVISIONS FOR ARTRAIN SPONSORS
 
Local sponsoring agencies must meet the following provisions in order to have
 
the ARTRAIN visit their town:
 
Fee:
 In Michigan - $1,500 per five day stay.
 
Out of Michigan - $6,000 per five day stay.
 
-8-
J 
Note:
 It is my impression that the fees are somewhat negotiable depending on
 
tour itinerary, logistics, politics, and need.
 
OTHER SERVICES TO BE PROVIDED BY LOCAL SPONSOR
 
1
. Four hotel rooms for train staff - two doubles and two
 
singles.
 Cost approximately $1,000.
 (This is usually
 
donated locally.)  The staff and artists have never
 
lived or travelled on the train since its inception
 
although the caboose does provide a lounge area for them.
 
2
. Fuel oil for the diesel generator providing all power
 
for the train.  This includes climate control, heat and
 
air conditioning, lights, and security systems.
 
3
. Two portable toilets.
 
4
. One rental car.  ARTRAIN staff pays for the gas.
 
5
. All advertising and promotion.  ARTRAIN provides posters.
 
6
. Gallery guides (docents) for each of the four cars'
 
exhibit hours.
 
Local sponsoring groups may not charge for viewing the ARTRAIN.  Many groups
 
schedule special previews for sponsors and local dignitaries at each stop.
 
NOTE:
 The maximum number of people that can view this exhibit in one day is
 
one thousand.

-9-
CO-OPERATING RAILWAYS
 
The following railroad companies have co-operated with the ARTRAIN by pulling
 
it, at their convenience, from one venue to the next:
 
The Chesapeake and Ohio Railway Company
 
Consolidated Rail Corporation
 
Detroit and Mackinac Railway
 
Grand Trunk Western Railroad Company
 
Michigan Northern Railway
 
Tuscola and Saginaw Bay Railway
 
(
The Santa Fe Railroad and the Southern Pacific Railroad used to pull them but
 
have stopped due to the expense.)
 
COST AND ACCESS TO TRAIN CARS
 
The original train cars used by the Michigan Art Train were donated.
 The
 
availability of cars is quite good costing roughly $4,000 for a used car in
 
reasonably good condition.
 (This may be a high figure.  Woodruff Price of the
 
Chessie System reports that his company has been giving old cars to the state
 
of North Carolina to be dumped in the ocean in order to create fish reefs.)
 
While access to train cars is relatively easy, the cost for stripping and
 
refurbishing the car to be used an as exhibition space is very high.
 The most
 
recent car converted for ARTRAIN use cost $120,000.
 This includes insulation,
 
heat, cooling, flooring, electricity, humidity control, exhibit cases, and
 
custom wood working.
 (The $120,000 cost is up from $75,000 for one of their
 
earlier cars with much of the same equipment.)
 
 
I
 
-10-
NEEDED IMPROVEMENTS FOR ARTRAIN
 
I
.  All the cars need more insulation to better protect against air and dust
 
leakage, and to have easier control of the temperature in each car.
 
2
.
 The program would like to have another full time position which would be
 
dedicated to education.
 
TRAIN STAFF AND BUDGET
 
The ARTRAIN has an annual budget of $600,000.
 Fifty percent of this covers
 
its twelve person staff which consists of six administrative positions and six
 
staff who are connected with the actual touring of the train.  The train staff
 
has a manager, one gallery co -ordinator, two technicians, and two artists.
 
One person always rides with the train while moving from one venue to the
 
next.
 
Budget Capsule:
 Staff
 $300,000
 
Insurance
 54,000
 
Fuel, Security,
 
Printing, Office,
 
Phone, Maintenance
 246,000
  
TOTAL:
 $600,000  
The insurance premium is for ten million dollars covering theft, fire,
 
breakage, accident liability.
 (They have recently increased their insurance
 
coverage after someone committed suicide by driving into the train pulling
 
them to a venue.)
 
-11-
VENUES
 
One of the primary difficulties with using trains as a mode of transportation
 
is the reality of where they must be parked at each particular venue.
 
Ideally, any exhibit needs to be in a familiar part of town, well lighted,
 
with ample parking, easy access, and attractive surroundings.
 None of these
 
conditions are easy to find in the areas usually available for parking the
 
Artrain during its tenure at each site.
 Local railroad people must find
 
unused track and acquire permission to park the train.  More often than not,
 
this unused track is next to grain elevators, old warehouses, industrial
 
areas, maintenance areas, or railyards.  These areas are not inherently
 
hospitable or desirable for attracting audiences.
 They also usually do not
 
have good parking areas or access roads that are familiar to the general
 
public.
 (Ironically, the ARTRAIN was parked at one of the very few beautiful
 
venues on its tour when I visited.  This was a beautiful park in Holland,
 
Michigan overlooking Lake Michigan.)
 
The staff of the ARTRAIN does all the scheduling with various rail companies.
 
They must reach a separate agreement with a variety of different companies
 
since they have been touring outside of Michigan.  The train companies donate
 
their services and pull the ARTRAIN behind the most convenient freight train
 
on their schedule.  Years of contacts have been developed in order to make the
 
coordination of this crucial aspect of the train tours possible.  The
 
fundamental fact is that the ARTRAIN functions by the grace and good will of
 
the rail companies servicing the areas they wish to tour.  Without their
 
donated services, the cost of moving the train would be completely prohibi-
tive. The cost of an engine, union crew, and access to tracks would be
 
impossible.

EXPLORATORY MEETINGS WITH RAILROAD OFFICIALS
 
I
.  MR. MAURICE ROSENBLATT - long-time lobbyist for many railroad industry
 
causes with familiarity with most of the key figures in the business and on
 
Capitol Hill.
 
Mr. Rosenblatt is a fascinating person combining a wonderful sense of humor
 
with a very intellectually steeped way of discussing various subjects.
 He is
 
currently on retainer for the Norfolk and Southern Railroad Company although
 
semi-retired.
 He was extremely helpful in setting the players and the
 
atmosphere of the industry in focus.
 
He is very interested in the arts and felt that it would be very much to the
 
benefit of various railroad companies to become involved in a travelling folk
 
art exhibit due to their historic personification as land grabbers and
 
spoilers, and corruptors of local governments.
 Particularly on the state
 
level, he felt there was much to be gained by helping to make possible the
 
visit of a nationally recognized exhibit to local venues.
 According to him,
 
there is a continual need to appease local politicians and this may be the
 
kind of vehicle that could provide such good will.
 
Having said that, he fears that the railroads, in the midst of a surge of
 
profits following de -regulation, may be too busy and too interested in only
 
moving cash income freight, or too complacent.  He hoped the view from the
 
railroad board room would be a little broader than that.
 Historically, he
 
regretted, they have not been that way.
 
 
I
 
-13-
He is a very good contact for many different aspects of the railroad business.
 
In traditional lobbyist optimism, he feels it is possible to talk them into
 
serious consideration of some form of participation.
 
2
.  MR. WOODRUFF "WOODIE" PRICE
 
CSX Corporation (Rail System)
 
(Also just acquired North American Van Lines)
 
Mr. Price was very interested in the possibility of a national tour of folk
 
arts.  He felt the major drawbacks for using trains were the price of moving
 
the trains from one place to another and the unattractive places that the
 
train would have to be parked.  He felt that the cost of the mandatory union
 
crews and the shifting from one jurisdiction to the next would be extremely
 
high if the train were pulled by its own engine and that track availability
 
would be very difficult to secure.
 He was very frank about his belief that
 
the parking areas for the train would not be conducive to drawing viewers.
 
Because a tour train would be "foreign" to the rail system's everyday routine
 
he felt that companies would be very reluctant to schedule it.
 
There is a format that would fit into their everyday routine that could move
 
the exhibit.  He suggested using their "piggyback" system of loading trailers
 
onto flat cars,  taking them into the region desired, and having them met by
 
tractors (trucks) on arrival to pull them to each venue.  The exhibit could
 
either be crated in the trucks to be set up later or each of the trailers
 
could be designed to be a preset exhibit itself.
 
L
  
-14-
The advantage is that railroad companies run hundreds of piggyback trains
 
daily to many different parts of the country.
 
There is certainly no problem with existing tracks as far as where they
 
actually could take an exhibit.  An extensive track system criss-crosses the
 
entire United States.
 The tracks are owned by many different companies.
 
NOTE:  The CSX Corporation is currently involved in a bitter court battle with
 
Norfolk and Southern Railroad trying to prevent them from acquiring the
 
Conrail System.
 
Upon arrival, the trailers could be pulled to any number of places in the
 
region.
 (This would be a savings in cost versus entirely pulling them by
 
truck only if the railroads provided the service free of charge.)  A question
 
to be considered is whether the exhibit could sustain the jarring of being
 
loaded and unloaded by crane without damage to the contents.  This also would
 
involve both trains and trucks which could complicate the planning and
 
scheduling of travel from venue to venue.
 
Mr. Price felt that there would be advantage for the rail industry, on a state
 
level, to help bring a folk art exhibit to local communities.  He stressed the
 
importance of their getting recognition with local politicians in a positive
 
way.  Since their tracks run through many different legislative areas, good
 
relations are vital to them on the local level.
 
I
 
-15-
 
He felt that there is a definite po ssibility of some
 sort
 of support
 in  
transporting an exhibit which may be no cost, at cost, or a combination of
 
those if the trailer idea was used.
 
If train cars were being considered, he recommended contacting Mr. Bob
 
Mathews, of the Railway Progress Institute in Alexandria, Virginia, about the
 
design and fabrication of train cars.
 (They are the company that makes train
 
cars.)  He also reports that they are in dire straits financially at this
 
time.  He also recommended contacting the Association of American Railroads,
 
the umbrella agency that coordinates the sharing of rail cars among various
 
companies.
 (They all constantly use each other's cars by necessity.)
 
Mr. Price would be the person to approach if specific proposals were ready to
 
be made to the CSX Corporation.
 
(CSX has a semi-annual train trip to various locations which is offered to
 
Congress and their staff as a good will gesture and to maintain visibility.
 
Two hundred and eighty people including eleven Congressmen made the most
 
recent trip - to Thomas Jefferson's estate.)
 
3
.  THE HONORABLE EDWARD BREATHITT
 
Norfolk and Southern Railroad
 
(Mr. Breathitt is a former Governor of Kentucky who is now an executive for
 
Norfolk and Southern Railroad Company.  He was instrumental in creating the
 
Kentucky Arts Council during his term.  His late wife was on the Board of
 
Directors for the Kennedy Center.)
 
-16-
Mr. Breathitt, although a firm patron of the
 
the feasibility of the rail system as a mode
 
exhibit.  He felt the Association of American
 
involved in any such plan and
 
arts, was not optimistic about
 
of transportation for a folk art
 
Railroads would have to be
 
recommended that I meet with them.
 (Maurice
 
Rosenblatt predicted that this would happen and said it was a sign of "passing
 
the buck" since it is only the companies who own the cars and track that can
 
make meaningful decisions.)
 
It would only be appropriate to re -approach Mr. Breathitt again once there was
 
a definitive plan accompanied by a well defined proposal.  His interest in the
 
arts is sincere.

 CAROL B
. PERKINS
 
Information and Public Affairs
 
Association of American Railroads
 
This was a very short meeting to touch base with the AAR and inform them of
 
our interest in possibly using trains for a touring exhibit.
 She shared the
 
feeling of others that cost and site location would be major problems.
 She
 
would be a good contact for helping to establish the public relations benefits
 
for the railroad industry and for possible coordination of efforts in
 
identifying the proper industry contacts when a proposal is designed.
 She
 
also recommended speaking with Susan Martin of Amtrak and Ilene Wirth of the
 
Union Pacific Railroad.

-17-
5
.  SUSAN MARTIN
 
Senior Director for Corporate Communications
 
Amtrak
 
L
 
Ms. Martin was interested in the possibility of a touring exhibit and reports
 
that Amtrak does run special trains.  However, in any project they are
 
involved with, they must cover their expenses by charging fees.
 (These are
 
extremely high including union crews,  track rights, maintenance, etc.
 Because
 
they are a tax supported company, she said they cannot donate equipment or
 
services.)
 
Amtrak does tour two exhibit cars of their own.  One is a static exhibit and
 
the other features a multi-projector slide show.
 In the past, Amtrak has
 
allowed other cars to be attached to their regularly scheduled trains.  The
 
cost, she said, of acquiring, preparing, running and maintaining a complete
 
train would be prohibitive.
 She can put us in touch with someone who could
 
more closely put figures on costs but the prevailing estimate of $
100,000 to
 
$125,000 just to set-up one train car sounded close to their figures.  Any
 
equipment to be used in conjunction with Amtrak must be compatible with their
 
cars.
 
Mr. Danny Boehr, General Superintendent for Transportation, would be the
 
contact for more detailed cost estimates - (
202) 383-2404.  Mr. Bruce Heard,
 
Senior Director of Special Events is a further contact - (
202) 383-2997.

 ILENE WIRTH
 
Union Pacific Railroad
 
Omaha, Nebraska
 
The Union Pacific Railroad seems to be very active supporters of the arts.
 
They are located in Omaha, Nebraska and have tracks in twenty-one states west
 
of the Mississippi River.
 Ilene Wirth was the most positive of any of the
 
railroad people I met.
 The Union Pacific Railroad is very public relations
 
minded and has run special excursion trains, pulled by their show steam engine
 
RE 9-51.
 They own three exhibit cars that were bought from the Canadian
 
organization that had bought them from The American Freedom Train.
 (Union
 
Pacific's General Director for Public Relations and Advertising, Joe
 
McCartney, was very involved in The American Freedom Train.  See details about
 
that project elsewhere in this report.)
 
If the train option is to be pursued, Union Pacific Railroad seems to be the
 
more likely system to become involved.
 Joe McCartney and Ilene Wirth both
 
seem inclined towards support of touring events although to what extent would
 
depend on the structure of the exhibit.  Most importantly, running special
 
trains is not alien to this company.

The American Freedom Train 1975-1976
 
The American Freedom Train was a twenty-two car extravaganza that toured the
 
United States during 1975 and 1976 as part of the celebration of the American
 
L
  
-19-
Revolution Bicentennial.
 It was the idea of Mr. Ross E. Rowland, Jr. a
 
commodity broker and avid train buff, who formed The American Freedom Train
 
Foundation to oversee the entire project.
 
The inspiration for this train was an earlier American Freedom Train in 1947
 
sponsored by the American Heritage Foundation.
 It stopped in every one of the
 
then 48 states.  That train had seven cars, three of which had exhibits.
 
The 1975-76 American Freedom Train had twelve exhibit cars, each with separate
 
themes, including "The Beginning",  "Exploration and Expansion", "Growth of the
 
Nation", "Origins",  "Innovations",  "Human Resources", "Sports",  "Performing
 
Arts", "Fine Arts", "Conflict and Resolution", and two "Showcase Cars".
 
(Please see addendum for more information.)
 
This project was a monumental undertaking that most likely would not have been
 
possible had it not been for the Bicentennial inclination of the railroads and
 
large corporations to become involved in the most significant national
 
celebration of the century.  The budget was 12.5 million dollars.
 
Despite the very large amount of financial backing for this project, this
 
train was still vulnerable to the fundamental problems of narrow exhibit space
 
in the cars and less than beautiful sites to park the train at each venue
 
(They tried to solve the narrowness/traffic flow problem of the trains by
 
employing a "moving walkway".
 I believe this tactic directly contradicts the
 
essence of viewing an exhibit by denying people the opportunity to view and
 
contemplate exhibitry at their own pace.)

THREE TOURS VIA TRUCKS
 
1
.  THE TENNESSEE VALLEY AUTHORITY TRUCK CARAVAN
 
In celebration of the Bicentennical, TVA mounted a five truck caravan that
 
toured throughout the Southeast.  Each of the five trailers was rebuilt into a
 
gallery area featuring exhibitry about the history of the Tennessee Valley
 
Authority.
 There was a very heavy emphasis on electronic equipment for
 
presentation.  The trailers were configured front to end in a semi-circle with
 
viewers walking one way only for the length of five trucks.
 The cost of
 
preparing each trailer was extremely expensive.
 (Very close to $100,000 per
 
trailer which is equal to converting a train car.)  The cost of the tractors
 
to pull them was additional.
 
Russell Alan, the director of this project, reports that they had very serious
 
maintenance problems throughout the tour which were quite costly.  He also
 
says he would never use that mode of transportation again because of the
 
startup costs and mechanical breakdown problems.
 
2
.  THE ELEANOR ROOSEVELT INSTITUTE TRUCK EXHIBIT
 
This one truck touring exhibit toured for one year, October 1983-October 1984
 
with an exhibit celebrating the 100th Anniversary of Eleanor Roosevelt's
 
birthday.  The truck made 75 stops each for two days during the year.
 Our
 
contact, Marjorie Spoerri of the Institute, had very few details about this
 
exhibit.
 (The project director was no longer around.)
 
A personal note:  Having waited for thirty minutes only to be turned away from
 
this exhibit at 5
:Olpm while it was at the National Folk Festival, I can
 
attest to the small capacity of this one truck exhibit and the slow audience
 
flow.

-21-
3
.  R.J. REYNOLDS'  "PRIDE IN TOBACCO CARAVAN"
 
This is another example of a trailer exhibit featuring exhibit cases and
 
electronic gear that tours extensively.  The goal of the exhibit is to "help
 
unite the complex tobacco family and to create greater public awareness of
 
tobacco's impact on the nation's economy."
 
A modest estimate of the cost of this one truck exhibit would be $250,000.
 
There is a stage attached to the side of the truck when set up that has live
 
music performances at the same time people walk through the truck to view the
 
exhibitry.
 (Again, the traffic is one way and narrow.)

TENNESSEE VALLEY AUTHORITY EXHIBIT BARGES
 
MR. RUSSELL ALAN
 
Tennessee Valley Authority
 
Knoxville, Tennessee
 
(Russell Alan has been the Director for two tour exhibits for the Tennessee
 
Valley Authority.
 The first incorporated a five truck mobile caravan to take
 
exhibits through the Southeastern United States in 1976.
 (
Discussed later in
 
this report.)  The second, and much larger project, involved barges in an
 
exhibit that was featured at the 1982 World's Fair and also toured the
 
waterways during the Summer of 1983.
 
The 50th Anniversary of the Tennessee Valley Authority was celebrated with the
 
use of two barge exhibits that toured as well as having tenure at the 1982
 
World's Fair.  Each had an exhibit area of 4
,500 square feet including a
 
theater area seating 100 people, and a second floor office.
 These barges pull
 
a very shallow draft.  The barges were designed to withstand winds of up to
 
100 miles per hour.
 
Mr. Alan reports that the exhibits were unqualified successes both at the
 
World's Fair and on tour.  The barges made 23 stops while touring
 
April-October 1983.  The barge was able to be pushed right up to the bank
 
where possible.
 The Coast Guard and River Captains were very co-operative
 
throughout the course of their travels.  They had a touring budget of
 
$750,000.  TVA considered it money very well spent.
 
-23-
The barges are now docked on the Tennessee River at Muscle Shoals, Alabama.
 
They have not been used since the summer tour ending in the Fall of 1983.
 On
 
November 7
,  1985,  I visited the barges along with Russell Alan to evaluate
 
their current condition to determine if they could be adapted for a folk arts
 
touring exhibit.
 
The barges are in effect, two very large buildings - 152' long and 34' wide
 
each.
 (End-to-end they are as long as a football field.)  The floors are made
 
of 2" by 6" pressure treated and fireproofed wood planks in very good
 
condition.
 They were built for the Army Corps of Engineers in 1944 and were
 
rebottomed in 1977 with a double hull.  The tops of the barges were sealed
 
before the TVA superstructure was built on top and there is virtually no
 
leakage through the bottom or the top.
 (Condensation does occur but this is
 
not a problem.  We checked the bilge area for leakage while I was there and in
 
six months, they had accrued only three inches of water.)
 
The superstructure on both barges is quite impressive using large steel
 
girders that can withstand winds of up to one hundred miles an hour.  Each
 
barge has a second floor office overlooking the exhibit level below.  The
 
exhibits themselves, from the TVA tour, have been removed but many of the
 
walls and structures that supported them are still intact.
 
One of the barges also has a one hundred seat theater complete with dressing
 
room area.
 A small "spud" barge also goes with the two larger barges to
 
facilitate mooring at each venue.  During the TVA tour the barges were
 
accompanied by a tow boat which pushed them from site to site and provided
 
power for the barges.
 (
The crew also had living quarters on the tow boat.)
 
A-
-24-
Mr. Alan's first quote on the cost of getting the barges set up for touring
 
was between $50,000 and $75,000 but when pressed about this after viewing the
 
barges he reduced that amount to around $35,000.
 (He has a side interest in
 
finding work for laid off employees of TVA in the area.  Work on the barges
 
would not have to be done by his people however.
 A less costly means of
 
bringing them up to speed can probably be found.  There is room for negotia-
tion as well.)
 
(PLEASE REFER TO PHOTOGRAPHS AND LITERATURE FOR MORE INFORMATION)
 
The basic schedule for visiting a venue with these barges took five days:
 One
 
day for set-up upon arrival, three days open to the public, and one day for
 
break down.
 Time between venues varied, of course, depending on the distance
 
between sites.  Tour stops were scouted in advance for attractive mooring
 
sites and contact was always established with local authorities and institu-
tions to provide local support and publicity.  The coming of these barges was
 
a big event in each location given the unique nature of the event.
 The
 
current trend in restoration and development along riverfront areas was an
 
important factor in the success that TVA experienced.
 
The Tennessee Valley Authority is very interested in seeing these barges used
 
again.  Their value together is $1,000,000.  According to Mr. Alan, he
 
believes TVA would be willing to lease both of them for a total sum of between
 
$1,000 and $1,500 per month.  This is quite amazing considering that these
 
barges provide 10,336 square feet of covered exhibit space that is also
 
portable.
 (The 60' spud barge is included in this price.)
 
-25-
The crew for the TVA tour included one captain, one co-pilot, two deck hands,
 
and two security.  The general cost was $250 per day while the barges were
 
moving and $150 per day while they were sitting.
 The barges can average about
 
five miles an hour while travelling and can cover 100 miles a day with a 24
 
hour crew set up.
 
It is recommended that the tow boat for pushing these barges have on board a
 
10OKW power generator or two 60KW generators to enable the barges to be
 
completely self-contained.
 
Other facts:
 
TVA had $500,000 worth of exhibitry on board.
 
They had telephone hook-up at each venue.
 
They used 16 volunteers to man the barges at
 
each venue.  (Retired TVA employees)
 
Their retail store did not make money.
 
The mooring configuration was always a
 
partially offset side-by-side situation.
 
Their schedule ran 9
:30am - 9
:OOpm.
 
PLEASE REFER TO THE SET OF BLUEPRINTS FOR BOTH BARGES CALLED "BARGE A" AND
 
"BARGE B".
 ALSO NOTE SEPARATE PLANS FOR POSSIBLE CONVERSION OF ONE BARGE TO A
 
LARGE PERFORMANCE HALL.
 
ALSO FIND MAP OF THE INLAND WATERWAY SYSTEM WHICH SHOWS THE NUMBER OF STATES
 
THAT CAN BE VISITED BY THESE BARGES.
 WHAT IS NOT APPARENT ON THAT MAP IS THE
 
POSSIBILITY OF VISITING THE EAST COAST STATES VIA THE COASTAL INLAND WATERWAY.
 
LONG RANGE TRIPS WITH THE BARGES CAN BE MADE BY ATTACHING THE BARGES TO
 
COMMERCIAL BARGE TOWS THAT FREQUENT THE WATERWAYS.
 THIS WOULD MAKE IT COST
 
EFFECTIVE TO GET THE BARGES UPRIVER TO BEGIN A TOUR SCHEDULE.

EXPLORATORY MEETINGS ABOUT RIVER TRANSPORT

Senior Vice-President
 
Transportation Services
 
American Commercial Barge Lines
 
(Mr. Whitlock is an expert on barges, tow boats, boat construction, river
 
travel on the inland waterways, and paddlewheelers.
 Jeffboat, Inc., an ACBL
 
owned company, recently built The General Jackson sternwheel showboat for
 
Opryland USA in Nashville, Tennessee.)
 
About commercial barge costs (current market prices):
 
Rental Fee = $50 to $
100 per day.
 They must have a companion
 
boat to supply electricity, provide room for crew and staff
 
quarters, and to push the exhibit barge from one location to
 
the next.
 
Tow Boat Crew = Captain @ $
175 per day
 
Pilot @ $125 per day
 
Cook @ $70 per day
 
Barge Crew = One @ $65 per day
 
-27-
Fuel Costs:
 The rule of thumb is that one gallon of fuel is
 
used per horse power of motor per hour.  Rough daily cost =
 
$900-$1,000 when moving from one location to the next.
 
Other information:
 
There is no fee for travelling through river locks.  Passage
 
is on a first come first served basis.
 Passenger boats are
 
given priority over freight barges.
 
Barge availability is very good.
 
NOTE:  The costs listed above are the full commercial rates and are not
 
necessarily applicable to a specialized touring barge.
 
Mr. Whitlock suggested looking into boats as an alternative.  The advantages
 
are that boats are self propelled, less costly to move from point A to B
, and
 
have more enclosed space.  It was his impression that there may be a stern-
wheeler available for rent or purchase.
 He said the New Orleans World's Fair
 
was using many different boats and suggested searching in the area for a
 
possible boat.
 He also recommended advertising in the industry "rag",
 
"Waterways Journal Weekly", for a boat with needed specifications.  This
 
publication is seen by everyone in the boat and barge business he said.
 
He also recommended contacting The National Waterways Operators Association,
 
Arlington, Virginia for more information about boat availability.

(Mr. Evanszyk is very familiar with the building, selling, leasing, and
 
availability of paddlewheel boats.)
 
Mr. Evanszyk does not share Mr. Whitlock's belief that there are usable
 
paddlewheel boats available for hire but he was not completely negative.  He
 
reports that the use of paddlewheel boats and river cruise boats is very much
 
in demand and that many people have approached his company as to where they
 
can be located for both purchase and rental purposes.
 
A boat large enough to house a folk art exhibit of substance that is in
 
operating condition is worth approximately $
1,500,000 and he knows of no such
 
boats that are sitting idle.  The demand for used boats is very high due to
 
the cost of building new ones.  Mr. Evanszyk estimates that a boat to fit our
 
needs would probably rent for $
200,000 for a Spring/Summer/Fall season.
 
Nevertheless, he thinks it would be a worthwhile exercise to advertise in the
 
Waterways Journal Weekly inquiring for a vessel large enough to house an
 
exhibit.

. NESZPAUL
 
Administrative Assistant
 
American Wind Symphony Orchestra
 
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania
 
The American Wind Symphony Orchestra has a floating "Arts Center" built on a
 
barge which has travelled some 65,000 miles on the waterways of America and
 
Canada since 1976.
 It is 195' long, 38' wide, and draws 7 feet of water.
 It
 
was built at Tidewater Equipment Corporation in Norfolk, Virginia.
 It is a
 
double hulled vessel, self propelled, powered by three outdrive diesel engines
 
on loan from the U.S. Navy.
 It is called The Point Counterpoint II.
 
During the summer of 1985 it visited forty cities along the Illinois and
 
Mississippi Rivers, the Great Lakes, and the East Coast.
 Included is a large
 
performance stage and a smaller 125 seat theater.  There are also living
 
quarters for the conductor and his family.  He also is the Captain of the
 
vessel!
 
They have a non— union operated/maintained vessel with a crew of 5-7 persons at
 
any given time.
 They operate during the summer months with a 2-3 day stay at
 
each location.  They mostly perform on the barge with occasional concerts at
 
nearby sites.
 This custom built barge was extremely expensive to build and
 
they report that maintenance is needed regularly.  They report that the vessel
 
and the concerts are always well received.

EVALUATION OF TRANSPORTATION MODES
 
The criteria for evaluating the various transportation modes discussed in this
 
report are the following:
 
I
.  The s
ize and type of exhibit that can be accommodated.
 
2
.  The regions it can tour and where it can be set up.
 
3
.  Cost of conversion for touring purposes.
 
4
.  Cost and convenience of moving from s
ite to site.
 
5
.  The number of viewers that can be accommodated per day.
 
6
.  Flexibility for both visual arts and performing arts.
 
7
.  Ability to capture people's attention.
 
A
. TRAINS
 
There are four fundamental problems with touring an exhibit via trains.  While
 
this mode appears to be an attractive, even romantic, way to take an exhibit
 
to the public, the underlying reality of the artistic and physical concessions
 
inherent to such an undertaking is impressive.
 
1
.  The equation of preparation/transportation costs versus money spent on
 
actual exhibitry/artists does not seem justifiable.  An overwhelming
 
percentage of the budget for such a project would have to be spent on the
 
medium rather than the message.
 
The best estimate by consultants as to the minimum cost of converting
 
rail cars to exhibit space is $
100,000-$125,000 per car.  This does not
 
include exhibit contents.  While there i
s a possibility of in-kind gifts such
 
as help with moving the train from site to site, no one expressed any interest
 
in funding the cost of car conversion.
 
I
 
-31-
2
.  Leaving costs aside, the physical limitations of narrow train cars
 
forces both the exhibitor and the viewer to compromise on the quality of
 
presentation and the experience of viewing.  Trains demand a "
one way viewing"
 
sequence forcing the viewer t
o continue moving on to the next car and
 
precludes re-examination of an interesting exhibit component.  According to
 
the Artrain s
taff, they can only accommodate 1
,000 people per day at most.
 
The kind of things that can be exhibited and the way they can be exhibited is
 
severely restricted due to the 9 foot width of the cars.
 
3
.  There is a consensus of opinion that more often than not, such a train
 
exhibit would have to be parked in less than desirable sites.  The train must
 
be left at venues on unused track which very often means near warehouses, by
 
grain elevators, railyards, or maintenance terminals.  These areas are
 
generally both unattractive and unfamiliar to the public with inadequate
 
parking facilities.  The image of the well-kept local rail s
tation in a
 
pastoral setting as a s
topping place for an exhibit train is far from reality.
 
4
.  The final consideration i
s the monumental cost and complexity of moving
 
such an exhibit from site to site.  There does seem to be a certain interest
 
in the industry for cooperation and in-kind support, however, even the most
 
enthusiastic of the rail companies (
Union Pacific Railroad) would have to 
cover their out-of-pocket expenses.  And these costs are very high including
 
fuel, union crews, maintenance, track fees.
 (
Estimated in the hundreds of
 
thousands of dollars.)  No one thought it was realistic to have a
 
self-contained train including sleeper cars and dining cars due t
o the very
 
high cost of s
taffing and operating such equipment.
 
I
 
-32-
CONCLUSION
 
Even if the funds could be raised to cover all the above expenses, the end
 
product would be too heavily handicapped by the medium of transportation to
 
justify the effort.  We can do much better and for far less money.
 
B.  TRUCKS
 
The great advantage of using trucks as a mode of transportation is their
 
flexibility of movement.  They can go just about anywhere there is room to
 
park them, from small school parking lots to major urban festivals.
 
Granting that important attribute,  trucks share many of the same drawbacks as
 
train cars.  A major exhibit would require at least three tractor-trailers to
 
house it.  The cost of each rig being somewhere around $100,000.  The cost of
 
converting the trailers into temperature controlled galleries is roughly the
 
same as a train car conversion (
$100,000-$125,000).
 
Again, the narrowness of the available space forces compromises the creative
 
possibilities for the exhibitor and the viewing pleasure of the public.
 
Multiple trailer exhibits must be set up end-to-end thus creating a one-way
 
channel.  Trucks also limit the number of people who can view the exhibit
 
during the course of a day, much like train cars.
 (And they are not quite as
 
interesting to be in as a train.)
 
Russell Alan, who directed a five truck "caravan exhibit" in 1976 vows to
 
never undertake another due to the mechanical breakdowns they experienced
 
during their six-month tour.  Each truck required maintenance on the tour
 
-33-
which hindered their schedule and finding an area to park five consecutive
 
trailers provide more difficult than expected.  In addition, each of the
 
trucks required its own driver.
 
In addition, any presentation of performing arts would require a special stage
 
with separate dressing quarters.  As a rule, such performance stages have not
 
been especially well suited to high quality presentation due to limited size
 
and protection from sun, rain, and wind for the performers.
 
CONCLUSION
 
Despite the advantage of unlimited venue selection provided by trucks, the
 
nature of the end product would be dictated heavily by the space limitations.
 
While the moving of these vehicles would not be as complicated as trains, the
 
cost of preparation, custom exhibitry, and maintenance does not justify the
 
end product.  An additional stage would have to be built for performance,
 
outside of the trucks, and this would make those presentations vulnerable to
 
the elements thereby weakening the overall presentation of the tour.
 
C
.  BARGES
 
This mode of transportation, which on the face of it sounds rather unromantic,
 
is in fact extremely well suited to an exciting and successful folk arts tour.
 
The space limitations, audience flow and size problems, and performing arts
 
limitations inherent to trains and trucks are not present with this mode of
 
transportation.
 
The 1982-1983 Tennessee Valley Authority Exhibit Barges proved that this can
 
be an exciting and popular way to take both visual and performing arts to a
 
diversity of places throughout much of the country.
 
I
 
-34-
The two barges used by TVA are very impressive and also available for use for
 
a folk arts tour.  They remain in excellent condition and can best be
 
described as two complete floating exhibit buildings.  Due t
o their large
 
s
ize, 1
52' x 34' each, there is more than ample space t
o mount a large variety
 
of exhibitry and to provide uncluttered viewing space for the audience.  One
 
of the barges already has a 100 seat covered theater for performance plus a
 
dressing room.  Both barges have good s
ized offices on the second level
 
overlooking the exhibit area. (
See barge blueprints for detailed information.)
 
The earlier tour of these barges by TVA was extremely successful and created
 
quite a lot of excitement at each stop of the tour due to i
ts unique nature.
 
While at the World's Fair in Knoxville, it accommodated over 2
.5 million
 
visitors in s
ix months.  These barges featured many different kinds of
 
exhibitry including computers, mechanical gadgets, graphics, photography,
 
sculpture, slide shows, and a large scale working model of a river lock that
 
could be operated by the viewers.  The stage was used for performance and
 
lectures.
 
The number of different places that can be visited by these barges is
 
substantial.  Thanks to the inland waterway system, tours could be mounted
 
from Minnesota to Brownsville, Texas and from St. Louis to Florida.  In
 
addition, there is a feasible way to t
our the eastern coastal states via the
 
coastal inland waterway and special channels in Florida.  Counting the
 
population within one hour's drive of the towns and cities that can be
 
visited, a very large portion of the population will have access to this
 
exhibit.
 (
See map of the inland waterway.)  The western states would be the
 
only region that could not be reached by these barges.
 
I
 
I
L
 
-35-
Costs for this mode of transportation are substantially less than trains or
 
trucks.
 
1
.
 Because of the large space available, existing exhibit cases and
 
exhibits can be used which will greatly reduce costs of set-up.
 
2
.  The cost of adapting and sprucing up both of these barges will be
 
less than the cost of converting one train car or trailer truck.
 
3.  Maintenance for these barges is quite low.
 
4
.
 Part of one barge can be converted for living quarters for staff and
 
performers which would greatly reduce the cost of the entire tour.
 
5
.
 A "spud" barge is included with these which is used for docking.
 
This barge, like the two main ones, is covered with wood decking and provides
 
an additional space for activities.
 (
TVA used it for dances.)  While on the
 
river, this barge can be used to transport whatever tour vehicle is necessary
 
for the staff to be mobile once it arrives at a new location.
 
The places that these can be parked are usually quite attractive and in
 
familiar places to the public.
 (The current renaissance in river development
 
and rehabilitation throughout the country will be an added advantage to
 
attracting audiences and finding attractive docking areas.  Advanced scouting
 
is required to find the best site.)
 
These barges are not in use at the current time and the Tennessee Valley
 
Authority is anxious to see them be put to use.
 The estimated total cost of
 
renting both barges and the "spud" barge for mooring is between $1,000 and
 
$1,500 per month.
 It is hard to imagine finding two such facilities on dry
 
land for such a low cost let alone the fact that they are built on moveable
 
floating barges.
 
-36-
CONCLUSION
 
Without doubt, this manner of mounting a touring exhibit is the best option.
 
These vessels provide both the size and f
lexibility to mount an exciting and
 
high quality touring arts exhibit and at far less cost than any of the other
 
modes considered.
 I
t is quite fortuitous that these exhibit barges not only
 
exist but are also available for use at a bargain basement price.  It is a
 
wonderful way to take an innovative, comprehensive, and entertaining
 
presentation of folk arts to many different communities of the country.  In
 
short, this option offers far more opportunity for success for substantially
 
fewer dollars.

RECOMMENDATIONS
 
A tour using the Tennessee Valley Authority barges is a very exciting
 
possibility.
 The potential benefits for folk arts and artists are excellent.
 
The idea of a floating celebration travelling the waterways of a large portion
 
of the United States has appeal for artists, folklorists, the public, and
 
importantly, potential corporate sponsors.  And, the precedent for success has
 
been set by the TVA tour.  This option should be pursued as quickly as
 
possible while the barges remain available.  Such a tour will support the
 
goals and rationale outlined in the beginning of this report.
 
SEQUENCE FOR IMPLEMENTING THIS PROJECT  
1
.
 Plan and Budget for Logistical Component of Tour
  
A comprehensive plan and realistic budget, in detail, should be formulated
 
focusing on the logistics, staffing, and operating of these barges.  This
 
would include fuel cost estimates, power supply, barge refurbishing, tow boat
 
and crew (there are a number of options), and travel schedules.  The
 
possibility of acquiring a tow boat and portable generators from the pool of
 
surplus Navy equipment should be pursued.  (I recommend this be done very soon
 
as I currently have access to a very highly-placed person in the Navy who
 
could facilitate any possibilities that might exist.)  This aspect would play
 
an important role in the final cost of transporting the exhibit.
 
2
.  Plan and Budget for Exhibit and Performance Content
  
Given the flexibility of this option, planning of this component should be
 
relatively easy and exciting.  There are many very interesting possibilities:
 
Electronic exhibitry, multi-media shows, computers, three dimensional
 
-38-
exhibitry, works of art sharing equal billing with live performance,
 
workshops, and lectures.  The system of programming used at the six month Folk
 
Art Festival at the 1982 World's Fair could be adapted very well to this tour.
 
It incorporated many different contributions from folk arts programs and
 
institutions into a basic fundamental structure that provided a revolving
 
variety of folk arts.  Existing exhibits of proven quality can be used due to
 
the amount of space available.
 
3
.  Funding
  
These two sets of plans and budgets can then be used to design a strategy
 
for a fund raising campaign.
 I believe the unique nature of this tour and the
 
number of states involved will prove to be attractive to private sector
 
sponsors.
 This project would be in line for major funding from the National
 
Endowment for the Arts due to its unique nature and the large number of states
 
and people who will experience it in communities of all sizes.
 
A POSSIBLE SCENERIO
 
Two touring seasons for these barges seem to be preferable in order to reach
 
the largest number of people.  Tour periods from May-November seem to best
 
suit this mode of travel with the barges being towed up river in order to run
 
down river for the course of the tour.
 The Spring,  Summer, and Fall of 1987
 
would leave ample time for scheduling and preparation.  The barges could
 
winter in a warmer climate before being towed north for the next season.
 
A typical tour would last for 180 days.  This would allow for twenty stops of
 
five days each, (one day set-up/three days open/one day breakdown).  This
 
would leave 80 days of travel which could cover up to 100 miles per day.

Even if this project were restricted to one six month tour, that tour could
 
cut through the heart of the country from Minnesota to the Gulf of Mexico.
 
The number of people living within one hour's drive to the river would make
 
the tour accessible to millions of people.
