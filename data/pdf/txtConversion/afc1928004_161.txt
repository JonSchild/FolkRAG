MARY AND HER LAMB. 
AIR :—" Mabel Waltz." 
From upward of a 
hundred manuscripts sent to the office 
of THE SUN, we select the following versions or the popu-
lar poem which relates the adventures of Mary and her 
lamb, as specimens of public opinion on the subject con-
veyed in metrical form. 
The variety and surprising nature 
of the adventures in which Mary and the lamb—and par-
ticularly the lamb—are involved, indicate a 
considerable 
development of the imaginative faculty among the con-
tributers. 
These productions are in the strictest sense pop-
ular poems. They emanate from a 
part of the great con-
/ 
stituency who read THE SUN, and are the artless, untutored 
utterances of the people. 
As such they will be sure to be 
appreciated. 
In most instances the authors modestly with-
hold their names; but the verses which we print first, in 
point of style and finish and in imaginative power, singu-
larly resemble those choice moreeaux, by the Hon. Von 
O'Hall with which our metropolitan weeklies are occasion-
ally enriched. 
The envelope enclosing them bore the 
monogram of the Lotus Club, of which the Hon. Von. O'H. 
is President. 
Dare we surmise that the poem is from his 
polished pen ? Here it is: 
Mary had a 
little lamb 
That couldn't read or write; 
When Mary offered him his hash, 
Her hand he'd always bite. 
Mary took her little lamb 
Round to the butcher's shop; 
Then Mary's father gave a 
feed 
With lots of mutton chop. 
Mary had a 
little lamb, 
It jumped down in the well, 
And after Mary pulled it up 
It ran and jumped down again, 
And was drowned. 
Mary had a 
little lamb, 
Its eyes were heavenly blue. 
And if you touch that little lamb 
" 
put a 
head on you." 
And so the teacher turned him out, 
But still he lingered near, 
And waited patiently about, 
" 
Then walked off' on his ear." 
[1]

MARY'S LAMB. ((_inyraruED.) 
She put him in his little bed,. 
And bade him go to rest. 
" 
You bet," the little lambkin said, 
"1'11 do my level best." 
Mary had a 
little lamb. 
She gave that lamb THE SUN, 
And when it red the news, it said, 
" 
That's how the whole thing's done. 
Mary had a 
little lamb, 
"rwas the very picture of jollity, 
But it never amounted to much, 
As it had no ancilliary quality. 
Marie hat von Eddie scheep, 
Hish void, vas plaek as ink; 
She dook him out to schkate von tay, 
Tint tround him in der Rink. 
Cut yen she go mit ped dat night, 
She tream she hear him pleating ; 
But Yen she vake, she vas misdake, 
He only vas a 
skeeding. 
NEW YORK, feb. 1st, 1870, 
mr. editor dear sir ascept this from a 
little girl 8 
years 
old. 
mary had a 
little lamd 
with her it would not go 
she throughed it down a 
flight of stairs 
.and how is that for low. 
Mary had a 
little lamb, 
And snow white was its skin, 
But when it followed her to school, • 
The boys said, " That's too thin." 
She missed him from her side; " Alas," 
She said, " my lamb's a 
goner." 
But he was only nibbling grass 
By the Little Church round the Corner. 
Mary had a 
little lamb 
That followed her with fear ; 
When Mary stopped to get a 
SUN, 
He " walked off on his ear."

MARY'S LAMB. (CoxmitJED.) 
Mary had a 
little lamb, 
That acted very queer, 
For every time she told it to 
"I'would 
walk off on its ear." 
By this, at last, it broke its neck, 
'Then up at Mary looked, 
And murmured, as it closed each eye, 
Dear Moll, my mutton's cooked.",. 
Mary had a 
little lamb. 
It's tail went with a 
jerk, 
So she cut it off behind the ears, 
, 
To " see bows the old thing work." 
Mary had a 
little lamb, 
Its fleece was white as snow, 
And every time it heard a 
ba-a-h,' 
It bleated "Not for Joe." 
Mary had a 
little lamb, - 
Its wool was black as ink, 
And everywhere that Mary went, 
The lamb went too, I 
think. 
He followed her down town one day, 
Which made Miss Mary swear; 
She caught him by his little neck, 
And pulled him by the hair. 
She made him " walk upon his Car." • 
And used him like a 
brute. 
Then ": put a 
bead " upon the dear, 
And " bust hint in the snoot." 
31ary had a 
little lanib, 
All covered o'er with . wool; 
lie wandered to the Stock Exchange, 
And tried to be a 
Bull. 
The brokers greeted him with joy, 
Approached him with a 
query, 
And offered to give him a 
certain point. 
On a 
few hundred shares of Erie. 
The Bears. embrace:1,111m with a 
hug, 
And urged him to take a 
risk ; 
But he vowed and swore he would'nt go in 
Until he could see Jim Fisk.

'MARY'S LAMB. (ComNum.) 
For Jim be went to the Opera House. 
And wagging his tail with a 
jerk. 
Told him about the brokers, and asked, 
"How does the old thing work ?" 
But Jim replied in his choicest French 
Prenez garde you do't get soled; 
Te'ne parle pas Anglais, 
Allez vous trouver Jay Gould. 
The last that was seen of the little lamb 
Was at the corner of Broad and Wall, 
He was going toward the stock Exchange, 
And never came back at all. 
Mary had a 
little lamb 
As round as any gherkin, 
She took to school the old thing once— 
" 
That's how it was a 
workin." 
It made the children laugh and play 
To see a 
sight so new— 
A 
little boy to Mary cried: 
"I'll put a 
head on you." 
The teacher unto Mary said, 
"You cunning little elf, 
Why did you thus ?" and Mary said, 
" 
You know how 'Us yourself?" 
When Mary had to leave the school, 
She cried in a 
sad, sad manner, 
And went to bed, and softly said, 
"That's what's the matter with Hannah." 
Mary hat von leetle lamp, 
Dat vas its mistress bride, 
It lift, oond lift, oond kept on lifting, 
Oond ten it slitoppt—oond died. 
Mary had a 
little lamb, 
He died and was a 
goner, 
She took him to Sabine, 
And he told her to go to the Little Church round the Cor-
ner. 
[4] 
MARY 
S LAMB. (Corrniun.) 
Mary lost her littuel lam, 
Its fat was fried out in lard; 
Its fleece made busily bombazine, 
Five quarters to the yard. 
Mary had a 
little lamb, 
It pleased Ulysses S.; 
She sent it on to Washington, 
And now she's Postmistress. 
Mary had a 
little lamb, 
It drank cold water freely, 
And looked so innocently wise, 
She called it Horace Greely. 
" 
Mary had a 
little Lamb," 
I've heard so often said. 
That all I 
know about it is, 
1 
wish that Lamb was dead. 
A contributor to the Virginia (Nev) Enterprise furnishes 
to that paper the following : 
"I cannot help writing poetry, no matter how hard I 
try. 
Legal, medical and theological advice has been taken in 
vain—nothing stops it—it must come. My 
friends have advis-
ed me to persevere, and I 
mean to do it. 
My 
last (and best) 
effort is as follows; • 
Mary had a 
little lamb, 
They got it very cheap, 
And when it was tired of being a 
lamb, 
It grew up into a 
sheep. 
One day it followed her from home, 
And didn't know what to think 
When it saw the people going around 
Inside the skating rink 
Then the lamb said; It's very queer. 
What ever could have got ern 
Just then poor Mary tumbled down, 
And bumped her little—head. 
Mary had a 
little lamb, 
And liked it very much; 
It pleased her better far than birds, 
Or ducks and geese, and such. 
[5]

MARY'S LAMB. (CONTINUED.) 
Whenever, Mary came from school, 
Her mother quick she sought, 
And gave her not a 
moment's peace 
Until her izimb was brought. 
And everywhere 'that Mary went 
The lamb was sure to go, 
Because when asked if she'd have more, 
lie never answered " No." 
What made dear Mary like the lamb, 
Does any one inquire ? 
Because E 
he knew how good it was, 
When roasted by the fire. 
Ard when served up with good mint-sauce 
And fresh green peas you'll know 
ow tis yourself, and understand 
Why Mary liked it so. 
Mary had a 
little lamb. 
It's fleece was white as snow, 
And anywhere that Mary went, 
That lamb it wouldn't go. 
So Mary took a 
stick, one day, 
And lammed it for a 
spell— 
They had him with green peas next day 
And he went very well. 
Mary had a 
little lamb. 
She laid it on a 
shelf, 
And every time it wagged it's tail, 
"You know how 'tis yourself." 
Mary had a 
little lamb. 
That was all over white, 
She put his hide on every day, 
And to keep it from wearing out too fast 
She took it oft at night. 
Mary had a 
little lamb. 
That stayed with her at home, 
[61 
17 
MARX'S LAMB: ( CoNUEUDED.)A‘::.. 
But she broke its wretched little neck, 
Because its wool was so confounded tangled 
That it would not comb: 
Mary had a 
little lamb, 
Left.ireland to its fate, 
That dined at Sweeney's ev'ry day, 
And drank its whisky straight. 
Ulysses had a 
little lamb, 
He called it St. Domingo— 
Now Sumner he went fierce for it 
knd grabbed it's wool, by Jingo! 
Mary had a 
little lamb 
That never missed its feed— 
It fed and whisked its little tail, 
Upon the Banks of Tweed! 
Mary had a 
little lamb, 
Sung Irish songs unfearin', 
But Wry tune had silvery sounds, 
To suit the (S) Harps of Erin. ) 
Mary had a 
little lamb, 
She sent to Colonel Burke, 
The exile smiled, and feebly said: 
" 
How does the old thing work.". 
4arybad an Irish lamb, 
From drink, she said, I'll wean ye, 
The lamb broke lose and joined the crowd, 
You'll find with young DAN SWEENEY. 
Mary had a 
little lamb, 
His name was " Slippery Dick ;" 
But Haveymer—though jolly Green— 
Did beat him every trick. 
Mary had a 
little lamb, 
His name was 0. K. Hall; 
.And every time they talked to him, 
He 'd 
loudly " Vouchers" call.

DAYS OF '49 IN CALIFORNIA. 
Oh, here you see old Tom Moore, 
A 
relic of former days. 
And a 
bummer too, they call me now— 
But what care I 
for praise? 
For my heart is filled with the days of yore, 
And oft do I 
repine, 
For the days of Old, the days of gold, 
And the days cf Forty-nine. 
I'd comrades then who loved me well, 
A 
jovial saucy crew; 
There were some hard cases I 
must confess, 
But still they were brave and true; 
Who'd never flinch, what'er the pinch, 
Would never fret or whine, 
But like good old bricks, they stood the kicks, 
In thfi days of Forty-nine. 
There was Kentuck Bill, I 
knew him well, 
A 
fellow so fall of tricks, 
At a 
poker game he was always thar, 
And as heavy too, as bricks; 
He'd play you draw, he'd ante a 
slug, 
And go a 
hatful blind ; 
But in a 
game with Death, Bill lost his breath, 
In the days of Forty-nine. 
There was Monte Pete, I'll n'er forget, 
For the luck that he always had; 
He'd deal for you both night and day, 
Or as long as you had a 
scad. 
One night a 
pistol laid him out, 
Twas his last Jay out in fine, 
It caught Pete sure, right in the door, 
In the days of Forty-nine.

• 
DAYS OF '49 IN CALIFORNIA. [CONCLUDED.] 
There was New York Jake, a 
butcher boy, 
So fond of getting tight; 
And whenever Jake got on a 
spree, 
He was sp'iling for a 
fight. 
One day he ran agin a 
knife, 
In the hands of old Bob Cline, 
So over Jake we held a 
wake, 
In the days of Forty-nine. 
There was Rackensack Jim, who could out-roar 
A buffalo bull—you bet; 
He roared all day, he roared all night, 
And I 
believe he is roaring yet. 
One night he fell in a 
prospect hole— 
Twas a 
roaring bad design— 
For in that hole Jim roared out his soul, 
In the days of Forty-nine. 
There was a 
poor lame Jess, a 
hard old case, 
Who never would repent, 
Jess never missed a 
single meal, 
Nor he never paid a 
cent. 
But poor old Jess, like all the rest, 
Did to death at last resign; 
For in his bloom, he went up the flume, 
• 
In the days of Forty-nine. 
Of all the comrades I 
had then, 
Not one remains to toast; 
They have left me here in my misery, 
Like some poor wandering ghost 
And as I 
go from place to place, 
Folks call me a 
traveling sign; 
Saying, " Here's Tom Moore, a 
bummer, sure, 
Of the days of Forty-nine."

As you out a

When the crowds are in the street, 
Passing by you to and fro, 
Oft by chance some one you meet; 
Soon he's walking by your side,

Envied by each single lass, 
'Who from out the passing throng, 
Jealous glances on you cast. 
And the swells that try to flirt, 
Find that they have got no show,

OLD FOLIC 
Written By J. 
W OOD. 
Now don't be sorrowful, darling, 
And don't be sorrowful pray, 
Taking the year together, my dear, 
There isn't more night than day; 
'Tis rainy weather, my darling, 
Time's waves they heavily run, 
But taking the year together, my dear, 
There isn't more cloud than sun. 
We are old folks, my darling, 
Our heads are growing grey, 
But taking the year all round, my dear, 
You will always find the May; 
We have had our May;-- my darling, 
And our roses long ago, 
And the time of the year is coming, my dear, 
For the silent night and snow. 
Time tries us most severely, 
And our children they are gone, 
Ah I 
the ones that loved us dearly 
Have left for their happy home; 
That I 
and you may meet, good wife, 
In that home that is above, 
Where all is day, for there's no night, 
But all is Perfect Love.

Christ who of the bondman shall the Liberator be ; 
And soon, throughout the sunny South, the slaves shall all be

Glory, eke. 
The conflict that he heralded, he looks from Heaven to view 
On the army of the Union, with his Flag, red, white, and blue, 
And Heaven shall ring with anthems o'er the deed they mean 
to do; 
For his soul is marching on 
Glory, dze. 
Ye soldiers of Freedom, then strike, while strike you may,

" 
AWFULLY JOLLY." 
lie—The first years of our matrimonial life, 
I 
consider'd extremely delicious, 
But lately my charming and dutiful wife, 
You appear to be very suspicious; 
I 
cannot walk out by myself half a 
mile, 
Or dine with a 
few hearty fellows, 
But a 
frown on your face takes the place of a 
smile, 
You've grown so excessively jealous. 
She—You were fond of your home, sir, and proud of your wife 
And to wander was never ambitious; - 
He—But lately there's nothing but trouble and strife, 
Since you've grown so very suspicious. 
UP IN A 
BALLOON." 
She—Suspicious you say, no wonder indeed, 
Yoirr conduct's outrageous, 
lie—Go on, ma'am, proceed, 
'Vow manor-s 
are charming and lady-like quite, 
She—You may sneer as you like, sir, but you know I'm right. 
It's lucky my temper is even and mild. 
He—Remarkably so, quite the style of a 
child, 
A 
temper like yours, when your tongue is unfurl'd, 
Would make a 
man wish himself out of the world. 
Or up in a 
balloon, ma'am, up n 
a 
balloon, 
That's were I 
shall wish myself, believe me very soon, 
Up in a

I 
should get a 
little peace, if I 
was up in a 
balloon.

She—You promis'd to be home, sir, at six, to dine, 
Instead of that von come, sir, at half-past nine. 
He—Allow me to explain, love, 
And then you'll not complain, love, 
Business me detain'd, love, 
Till the clock struck nine. 
She— Not business, sir, but pleasure, 
The home you once did treasure, 
You come to at your leisure, 
And wish me to believe

If that is your excuse, sir, I 
must decline 
To hear another word, sir, such quibbles are absurd, sir, 
tie—Why cannot I 
convince this wife of mine ? 
" HORRIBLE TALE." 
He — I've often heard it said and sung 
That men and women, old and young, 
If e'er convinc'd against their will, 
Were of the same opinion still: 
And as I 
can't to-night forsooth, 
Convince my wife I 
speak the truth, 
A 
simple plan I 
will essay, 
To drive some jealous thoughts away. 
" REAR IT LIRE A MAN." 
And gayly sing from day to day, 
And do the best I 
can 
To drive such jealous thoughts away 
Or bear it like a 
man.

letter here addressed to him, 
To read I 
can't resist, 
Dear Brown, we meet at half-past eight, 
A 
quiet hand at whist, 
And Champagne supper just for five, 
Altho' the number's odd— 
There's Fred and Charley, (Jones don't play), 
Yours truly, Tommy Dodd. 
I

it's Tommy Dodd, Tommy Dodd, 
Pretty business you'll allow,

THE CURLY LITTLE BOW WOW. 
Miss Biggs was an old maid, 
So stately and s 
D staid, 
And her house in Portman Square, 
Was crowded with nick-nacks, 
And china all in cracks, 
• 
With articles of vertu rare ; 
She'd a 
parrot gray, call'd " Polly," 
That could whistle " Nix my Dolly ;" 
But the pride of her life, I 
vow, 
Was a 
pretty little poodle, 
Of the name of Shanky Doodle, 
Which she used to call her bow, wow, wow, 
CHORUS. 
For a 
jolly girl was she, 
So easy and so free, 
With her curly little bow, wow, wow. 
Great pains Miss B. would take 
Her little pet to make 
In health and strength quite sound; 
To keep its coat like silk, 
It was fed on bread and milk, 
And when Saturday morn came round 
She'd put it in a 
tub, 
And its coat begin to scrub; 
Then she'd towel it dry with care, 
And take air and exercise, 
With her pretty little prize, 
In the neighborhood of Mayfair. 
For a 
jufly, & c. 
But her poodle long had pined 
Its liberty to find, 
As though of all sense bereft., 
She, with no one near to warn her, 
One day darted round the corner, 
When the street door was open left. 
. 1 
CURLY- LITTLE BOW WOW.. kcYrourp. 
Miss B., when told the news, 
Was afflicted with the blues, 
And grew nervous over tea, 
And was very nearly cranky 
At the thought of losing Shanky, 
Who she never more thought to see. 
For a 
jolly, & c. 
Now, not far from Portman Square, 
There resided, I 
declare, 
An old Major of the name of Boodle. 
One evening after dark, 
While walking in Hyde Park, 
He met a 
distracted poodle. 
He was smitten with its charms, 
So he took it in his arms ; 
While his bachelor days to end, 
He said, when he was shown her, 
That he'd wed the lucky owner 
Of his curly little canine friend. 
For a 
jolly, &c. 
The owner he found out, 
From the hand bills round about. 
The Major off did start, 
With the poodle in a 
string, 
Saw the maiden Biggs--poor thing 1— 
And offered her his hand and heart. 
Upon his 1;nees he went, 
And, asking her consent, 
Said a 
happy man was he; 
While stroking like a 
noodle 
That pretty little poodle, 
She promised that his wife she'd be. 
For a 
jolly, clre.

THE CONCERTINA MAN. 
I'm an open-air musician, and something of a 
star, 
To satisfy the public I 
journey near and far; 
With a 
fiddle and a 
harp each day we meet, 
And play the pop'lar melodies in almost ev'ry street, 
I 
play the Concertina, and I 
don't mind saying 
That the open-air arrangement is as cheerful as its paying, 
I 
was happy till one day I 
play'd outside her door, 
But now I've done with happiness for:evermore. 
CIIOILUS. 
Her name was Angelina, and she liked the Concertina, 
You really should have seen her when I 
played outside her door, 
I'm sure no love was keener than I 
felt for Angelina, 
But she's cut the Concertina, I 
shall never see her more. 
In a 
house down a 
street not far from this place, 
Lived the object of my love, such a 
figure, such a 
face; 
play'd outside her door, not selfishly for pelf, 
But just to catch a 
glimpse of her lovely self; 
The fiddle and the harp used to grumble and say— 
That love was all bosh and never would pay; 
But I, I'd have travelled North, East, West and South, 
To gain but one sight of that eyes and those mouth. 
Her name was, &c. 
She said she wanted lessons, and I 
gladly taught her, 
And one of Lachenal's instruments, a 
beauty ' twas I 
bought 
her; 
She learnt, I 
wooed, the hours flew by, ah, now I'm going to tell, 
How one day going down to Kew, my hopes went down lib 
well, 
[1] 
THE CONCERTINA MAN.—[CoNommtn. 
Oh ? Jones, fales Jones, the harpist, however could you do it, 
I 
loved that girl to madness, yes, horrid Jones, you knew it, 
Such treatment from a 
chum, I 
can't find words to tell, Oh— 
Your conduct's doubly base Jones, in fact a 
violent-sell-o. 
Her name is, & c. 
The day was fine she was on board, we took a 
lot of money, 
When Tubbs, the fiddle, says to me, says he " It's rather 
funny; 
The way that Angelina looks at Jones, and Jones at she, 
I 
saw them wink, and if they're not all right it's odd to me." 
I 
rush'd at Jones and took him by his ugly nose, just so, 
When Angelina started up, and screamed " just let him go : 
My feeling shall are haltered, and my mind is chang'd for ever, 
I'm Jones', Jones' honly," were the words, so help me never. 
Her name was, & c. 
Oh, agonies of agonies, I 
gave an awful leap. 
And jump'd from off the steamer into the briny deep: 
It was unfortunate for me, the tide was very low, 
I 
could not drown, oh cruel fate to serve a 
fellow so. 
They fish'd me out all muddy, and a 
sadly wiser man, 
Though Angelina's conduct forget I 
never can; 
I 
mean to stick to bus ness, and hope each night to see. 
Your smiling faces while you join in chorus here with me.

How do 
you like 
the 
mil - i 
ta - ry 
style? 
I 
joined the rants so martial, 
As you can plainly see, 
Though to " Reviews" I'm partial, 
No " rifle-butt" I'll be. 
At " small sword exercise" I'm great, 
Although perhaps you'll smile, 
I 
do the " goose-step" like a " duck," 
In military style. 
Chonc8.—How do you like, &c. 
To " sham fights" I'm devoted, 
And always " gain the day;" 
Fm sure to be promoted 
For " merit" not for " pay." 
I've read the deeds of" Wellington," 
But in a 
little while, 
I 
fancy I 
shall " cut him out" 
In military style. 
Chortus.—How do you like, &c. 
And when there's warfare raging, 
There often is, no doubt, 
With manners so Engaging, 
I'll put the foe to rout; 
I'll storm the trenches, scale the walls, 
The enemy I'll " rile," 
And if I'm beat—I'll run away 
In military style. 
Chorus.—How do you like, &c.

JACK'S PRESENT. 
Oh! there was a 
sailor bold and his name it was Jack 
Tiller, 
He fell in love with Polly Arabella, daughter of the miller; 
She was as pretty a 
gal as you'd wish, 
To see at a 
milldam a 
catching of fish, 
And she fish'd up a 
Jack, and he says to she, 
" 
Oh pretty, pretty Polly you are now just twenty-three 
twenty-three,"—(whistles). 
If you only say you will be my bride, 
To me you'll be spliced, whatever may betide, 
Fli fetch you a 
present from the roaring sea, 
Whatever you may fix upon that present is to be. 
" 
All right," she says, " your ship is bound for northern 
seas to sail, 
You say you'll bring me anything, then bring me back a 
Whale!" 
CHORUS. 
Hilly, ho! hilly ho! hilly ho, boys I 
Hilly ho, boys! hilly ho! 
Hilly ho, hilly ho! hilly ho, boys ! 
Hilly ho, boys, hilly ho ! 
Now Jack he went afloat like all his parental Tillers, 
And his ship got sealed HERMETICALLY in the midst of the 
frozen billers. 
But no kind of assistance never came nigh, 
And " Time " was the only thing as ever passed by ; 
They'd devoured all their beefs, and their muttons, and 
porks, 
[

JACK'S PRESENT. [CONCLUDED. 
And they made belief 'twas meat when they nibbled the 
bulwarks—the b 
ul warks—(whistles) 
At length came a 
thaw, and the ice got slack, 
And the vessel as folks say " came out in a 
crack," 
But the crew after ten years look'd miserable sights, 
For they had no solid food except the " Northern Lights," 
They'd eaten all their canvas sails and likewise all their 
cordage, 
And some say that they put away a 
little boy from Shore-
ditch ? 
Now Jack he met a 
friend in London when he landed, 
Says he, I've been away ten years and I 
ha-a-vent caught 
Polly a 
whale to be candid, 
I 
whistled and I 
tried to put salt upon their tails, 
But very artful indiwindywiduals is whales. 
Says the friend " how old might your sweetheart be ?" 
Well pretty, pretty Polly is over thirty-three—thirty-three 
(whistles) 
She's got a 
grey hair p'raps and one or two wrinkles, 
Whilst you've lived on Petroleum and frozen periwinkles, 
So take my advice and hnmediately pop, 
Into Wiggins's emporium—the lace and bonnet shop. 
And purchase a 
lace wail at once and under circumstances, 
I 
think you'll find her quite disposed to favor your ad-
vances.

LITTLE ETIVLY. 
Written by J. B. 
LAWREEN. 
It isn't at the East-end, nor is it at the West, 
But just between the two there's a 
spot I 
love the best, 
You do the heights of Clerkinwell and when you reach the 
top, 
Of a 
bill called Pentonville, you'll see a 
little shop, 
I 
do not know the owner's name or neither do I 
care, 
But just behind the counter stands the fairest of the fair, 
Selling penny ices both the day and night is she, 
• 
Of course I'm awful spoons on her and she's the same on 
me. 
Dear little Em'ly, I 
love her as my life, 
Dear little Einly I 
mean to make my wife; 
For sweet little Emly, my heart is never still, 
Who sells penny ices on the top of Pentonville. 
Both raspberry, and strawberry, and lemon ice she makes, 
Elder wine, and blackberry, and yellow soafr'y cakes ; 
Piaster of Paris sugar plums, lemonade and Pop, 
And chestnuts in maccasar oil are friz'led in the shop. 
And there you'll see on Sunday nights, no end of little boys, 
Who while they try to do the grand kick up an awful 
noise; 
On hot coffee and potatoes, why it's there they get a 
fill, 
Just for two-pence half penny, on the top of Pentonville. 
Dear little Em'ly, 
Tho' by ices she's surrounded, she never treats me cold, 
Her hair it is the color of Abyssinian gold ; 
She doe's the_Grecian Bend, and she's got a 
Roman nose, 
{1]

LITTLE EMELY. [CoNcLuRE1.1 
Her eyes are bright as diamonds, her lips are like the rose, 
She wears a 
lovely chignon, when: she's out in the street, 
A thing called a 
pannier, a 
yard above her feet; 
And talk about* a 
wasp-waist, I'm sure you need'nt 
When I 
tell Yon that her's Pleasure's just three inches and 
a 
half. 
Spoken.—Of course I 
ought to know the size, when I've 
measured it—tind she says by high pressure she'll 'get it 
another inch less before we are married. 
Dear little Duly, itc. 
I 
thought about a 
week ago, when I 
was in the shop, 
Just finishing a 
raspberry, the question now I'll pop, 
She softly answered " yes," then named the happy day, 
But said to me in everything, she meant to have her way. 
To that I'd no objection, so married we shall be; 
And shunt I 
just be jolly with a 
baby on my knee, 
Be it either boy or girl to me it's just the same, 
rf 
No matter to me what it's sex, Little Em'ly it's name. 
Spoken—And you can all come to the christening, and 
drink our healths in ginger pop, cool your over-flowing joy 
in penny ices—and do a 
sure feed on baked potatoes, and 
fried pap.

THE LATEST STYLE THAT'S OUT. 
Written and Sang by J. W. LLOYD. 
In me you see the latest fashion, 
For this style I 
have a 
passion, 
Look so neat in the street, 
So grand, So grand. 
I'm going to cause a 
great sensation, 
By my style throughout the nation. 
Make it please, it's the cheese, 
So grand, So grand. 
CHORUS. 
No matter night or morning, wherever I 
may go, 
I 
give all swells a 
warning whene'er myself I 
show, 
My style is very dashing and. not much seen about. 
Of course it's not, because I've got the latest style that's out. 
Should I 
through the Park go strolling, 
Or in my carriage gaily rolling, 
Damsels fair, stop and stare, 
So grand, So grand. 
Swells with light kid gloves and glasses, 
Leave their sweethearts and their lassies, 
Just to see, look at me, 
So grand, So grand. 
No matter night, &c. 
My tailor's name I 
must keep latent, 
Till I've taken out a 
patent, 
For the suit, hat to boot, 
So grand, So grand. 
There's no other knows the secret 
If they did they couldn't bent it, 
Style so fine, cut a 
shine, 
So grand, So grand. 
No matter night, &c. 
Though the cut is rather funny, 
Still it costs a 
lot of money, 
I 
care not, I've a 
lot, 
So grand, So grand, 
To cut a 
dash is my ambition, 
Still I 
think I'm in condition, 
I'm so gay, lead this sway, 
So grand, So grand.

MOONLIGHT, STARLIGHT, DAYLIGHT. 
While going thro' this brilliant world, 
So many lights we see, 
There's moonlight, and there's starlight, 
And daylight makes the three ; 
They are the three great lights, we are told, 
At least we'll let them be, 
For daylight is a 
jolly time, 
And moonlight shines so free. 
CHORUS. 
Moonlight, starlight, daylight or other lights, 
Rushlight, sunlight, no matter what they be, 
Gaslight, nightlight, candlelight or limelight, 
Skylight, lamplight, are pleasant unto me. 
First moonlight shines so brightly, 
The stars they glitter so; 
The daylight shows us daily, 
Wherever we do go: 
The gaslight burns so gayly, 
While the rushlight's glimmer glow ; 
The best and dearest of all things 
Is light, that we all know. 
Moonlight, &c. 
One day I 
purposed that I'd go, 
IA 
Palace for to see: 
The sun was shining bright that day, 
The birds sung out their glee. 
The day it passed, the evening came, 
While sitting down to tea, 
A bird came whistling in my ear, 
And singing merrily. 
Moonlight, &c. 
It shines on man and woman, 
It shines on cattle too ; 
But most I 
hope sincerely, 
It shines on all of you. 
It shines on houses, and on lands, 
The waters and its view, 
flow pleasant of a 
sunny day, 
When the sky it looks so blue.

LIFE UNDER THE LIGHTS. 
Under a 
light from a 
chandelier, 
A scene of splendor we view, 
Age, youth and beauty we see here 
And wealth shows what it can do ; 
'Midst glittering jewels and rustling silks, 
This scene's a 
fashionable ball, 
It's cold without, but what care they, 
Under the rich man's hall. 
CHORUS. 
Under the lights, how many sights, 
In this great world we see, 
In pictures true, I'll show to you, 
how they appear to me. 
Under the light from a 
policeman's lamp, 
A poor wretch next we see, 
hungry, homeless, cold and damp, 
And his crime is poverty. 
" 
Move on " says law, " move on " but where ? 
There's no helping hand to save. 
So the river finds him a 
spot to die. 
And the Parish a 
pauper's grave. [Under the, &c. 
Under the light of a 
street lamp's ray, 
A drunkard stands alone. 
Asking the post to show him the way, 
To reach his neglected home. 
And by the light of a 
wretched fire, 
Watching the fait fading life. 
Of her dying child, a 
mother sits, 
A mother, and drunkard's wife. [Under the, &c. 
Under the. light, the still moon-light, 
A vessel we now see ride. 
O'er the dark blue waves, on this calm night, 
Thro- the gentle rippling tide. 
She's homeward bound with hopeful hearts, 
Dreaming of home while they sleep, 
But when to- morrow's sun shall rise. 
They'll sleep beneath the deep. [Under the, &c. 
Under the light of the glorious sun, 
A busy city is seen. 
Where men and women. old and young, 
Fight hard against the stream. 
We leave this scene, and in the fields, 
how beautiful is the sighti 
Of hillQ nod dales and sparkling brooks. 
Under the bright sun-light. [Under thec. 
SUCH IS LIFE. 
Written and Sung By J. W. raoro. 
Life seems a 
strange and mazy dream, 
And like a 
river wide, 
And as we glide along,the stream 
What strange things oft betide, 
Some folks have riches in galore, 
No signs of toil or strife, 
Whilst more deseving men are poor, 
...us strange, but such is life. 
CHORUS. 
We meet with many ups and downs 
First happiness then strife, 
Dame Fortune give her smiles and frowns 
By turns, but such is life. 
Though dark clouds close on every side, 
And no escape we find, 
A change of fortune sends them wide, 
The bright sky shows behind, 
The longest lane must turn at last 
As joy succeeds to strife, 
And then when all our cares are past, 
We think, that such is life. 
We meet with many, dm. 
One day we might perhaps repine, 
And think how hard our task, 
The next, bright Fortune's rays may shine, 
And we beneath them bask, 
Then let us strive to be content, 
Though pressed with cares and strife, 
These troubles for the best are sent, 
To us, for such is life. 
We meet with many, Arc.

SHE WAS A SERI-COMIC SINGER. 
Written by GEORGE HERBERT. 
The other evening for a 
walk, 
Thro' Charing Cross I 
strayed, 
And just to pass the time away, 
Went into the Lowther Arcade. 
I 
shall ne'er forget the funny things 
That I 
saw there for sale, 
'Twas there I 
met a 
charming girl 
And she wore a 
bright green veil. 
CEIORI33.— She was a 
serio-comic singer 
From the West-end Music Hall, 
And she quite took this heart by storm 
With her pretty green Parasol. 
As she passed me by I 
heaved a 
sigh, 
She gave a 
knowing wink, 
So I 
offered her my arm and asked 
If she with me would drink ? 
She paused and then replied " yes, sir, 
1'11 have some ice cream soda," 
Then into Gatti's we went, 
And my love I 
quickly told her. 
Spoken.—Yes, and in return she told me it was the same with 
her, as it was with me, love at first sight, but she let me know 
more than she intended I 
could see, and that -was, she was going 
to open at " Deacon's " the next evening, as 
A 
serio-comic singer, (tc. 
Next night, my boys, of course I 
went 
Into Deacon's Music Hall, 
And there I 
saw and heard my love 
As she did loudly bawl, 
But judge of my surprise, 
When a 
fellow rushed on too, 
I 
rushed out of the Music Hall, my friends, 
Not knowing what to do. 
Spoken.—Yes, at first I 
intended throwing myself down a 
plug 
hole and drowning myself, upon second thoughts I 
rushed back 
to the chairman and asked him what he knew of her ? he said 
he knew she was lately married to a " Pro," and that she now is 
a 
duetist, but before— 
She was a 
serio-comic, cte. 
But now I 
will be off, my friends, 
A 
broken hearted card, • 
For all my hopes are blighted, 
And my happiness is marred. 
But I 
never more will speak, 
To those charming little maids, 
Who try to catch tck victims, 
While strolling in Arcades. 
She was a 
serio-comic, itEc.

RORTY SAM. 
Written and Sung by J. 
TROWBRIDGE. 
An :—"Artful Joe." 
Now you've heard of Artful Joe, and you've heard of Ikey Bill, 
That dashing yob who went to France to see the " Gay Mabille." 
The style of both these knowing youths is looked upon as grand, 
But against this mob as rivals, for long they will not stand. 
For I'm the cove that tops them, in fact they all confess, 
From East to 'West there's not a 
swell with such a 
style of dress, 
But I 
see you all look curious snd wonder who I 
am ? 
Well allow me to inform you that I'm known as Rorty Sam. 
CHORUS. 
Now did you ever see such a 
Ikey card before ? 
My togs are up to " nix," but they look immense I'm sure, 
I'm a 
Lardy Dardy Coster and I'd have you all to know, 
I'm known as Rorty Sam, my pals, wherever I 
may go. 
Now I 
earn my money honestly, tho' I 
like to do the grand 
I've as nice a 
little round as any Coster in the land, 
And it still keeps on increasing, the reason I'll confess, 
Is because I 
captivate the girls, with my dashing style of dress. 
But I've got a 
little Donah, her name it is Flash Kate, 
She is a 
regular clipper, pals, she is, and no mistake, 
When we go out on a 
Sunday, Oh I 
how the people stare, 
They think that I'm some Duke, and she a 
Duchess I 
declare. 
Now did you ever see, dr.c. 
To the Garden, Field, or else the Gate, each morning I 
take a 
drive, 
And you should hear the Costers' cheer directly I 
arrive, 
They proudly lead my donkey and quickly clear the way, 
Then they shout " Hurrah " here's Rorty Sam the hero of the 
day. 
They know full well beneath my coat there beats an onest heart, 
For I 
always do my best to play an upright honest Part; 
If I 
meet a 
chum that's in distress, I 
help him all I 
can, 
To start him in his graft again is the style of Rorty Sam. 
Now did you ever see, dm

BRIGHT EYES. 
Written by HARRY SYDNEY. 
I've a 
song to sing, 
Not too long to sing, 
And I 
hope you will not think it wrong to sing, 
'Tis a 
merry one, 
Just the very one, 
That any one would like to know; 
"Xis a 
sporting one. 
And a 
courting one, 
For lovers just the very sort of one. 
Whether old or young, 
When they hear it sung, 
They'll like it very much I 
know.• 
Bright eyes are glist'uing. 
Tiny eyes list'ning, 
What I 
shall sing of they all want to know. 
There's a 
maiden fair, 
With her raven hair, 
Gently waving in the morning air, 
Though now sad enough, 
She'll be glad enough, 
But when she would like to know 
• There's a 
gentle swain, 
With his heart in pain, 
Soon in Hymen's bonds they will be twain 
But the days are long, 
As they roll along, 
What they sigh for I'd like to know. 
In the prime of life, 
One wants a 
wife, 
Rumor with the wedding now is rife, 
One not worth a 
rap, 
At him sets her cap, 
She'd like him very much I 
know. 
" 
He has gold," says she, 
"She's a 
scold" says he; 
" 
At least that's what I 
have been told," said he, 
"-I'll be true," says she, 
" 
Then you'll do," said he, 
Now that's just what I 
want to know I 
Love is never old, 
So the poets told. 
It makes the heart to feel both young and bakl. 
As in ages past, 
So 'twill ever last, 
The reason I 
should like to know! 
But it must be true, 
Both with me and you, 
Thro' the world we ramble two by two. 
Whether small or great. 
Each requires a 
mate. 
Who'll be mine I 
should like to know I

Mist by the streamlet roaming, 
What sweet thoughts came to me, 
-As I 
watch the waters foaming, 
When waiting, love, for thee. 
The evening bells now ringing, 
So merrily and clear, 
To tell the hour that's bringing 
My love to meet me here. 
Roaming by the streamlet, 
Waiting, love, for thee, 
Listening for the footsteps 
Of one who comes to me. 
Fair nature's now reposing, 
And Earth in' grey seems drest, 
Each flower it's leaires now closing, 
The sun has sank to rest. 
The EDQ011'S now brightly beaming 
While twinking stars above, 
To me seem fondly gleaming, 
With joy tO see my- love. 
Roaming, clso.

sadness 
In the quiet and gentIonight, 
But I 
welcome with gladness, 
The beautiful moonlight;

While on it's banks I'm roaming,

OUT IN THE COLD. 
By Sr BAGNALL. 
Gazing on noblemen's mansions of splendour, 
Fill'd with perfume and shining with gold, 
A thought often strikes me, do great ones remember 
Those that are shivering out in the cold. 
CHORUS. 
Hungry, dejected, feet unprotected, 
Houseless, homeless—sad to behold, 
Eyes red with crying, care- worn and sighing, 
Shivering and shaking out in the cold. 
No one to soothe the sad heart of sorrow, 
None to pity—plenty to scold ; • 
None will ask if he lives to-morrow, 
Shivering and shaking out in the cold. 
Hungry, 'ie. 
What has he done to be so neglected ? 
Why do you thrust 1im away from the door ? 
Perhaps he was once most highly respected, 
The answer is simply,—because he is poor. 
Hungry, (fa., 
What is that dark-looking object, before us ? 
A 
funeral, carried from the workhouse I'm told, 
They're taking a 
poor wretch home to his friends, 
They found him last night out in the cold. 
Hungry, ikc. 
Friends of the churchyard, none there will scorn him, 
E'en from the best down to the worst; 
He'll soon be forgotten, no one will mourn him, 
Where he commingles his dust with the dust. 
Hungry, 
c. 
Sad scenes of sorrow, each coming morrow, 
Brings in it's dull stealthy pace day by day; 
Heaping fresh troubles on man to his horror, 
Till death seals his doom, aud he passes away. 
Hungry, &re.

GOING OUT FISHING. 
Written by J. B. 
LAWRERN. 
Izack Walton's book, I've oft read of the joys 
And delights of the gentle sport, 
So started out of town, with jolly Jack Brown, 
Both equipp'd like such anglers ought: 
Soon the river we reach'd, and got into a 
punt, 
But forgot that the stream ran fast, 
We began to fish for chub, in a 
boat like a 
tub, 
And got wrecked upon the bank at last. 
CHORUS. 
Thro' going out a 
fishing, going out a 
fishing, 
How often now I'm wishing, 
I'd never seen a 
brook, or Izack Walton's Book 
On the pleasures and the joys of Fishing. 
We next got into a 
field, but didn't see a 
board, 
With a 
notice of the dog " Beware," 
And angled in the stream, for jack perch and bream, 
Says Brown, we shall have a 
bite here. 
We stood watching our floats, and longing for a 
bite, 
In the rain for an hour and a 
half. 
When ' midst an awful rout, I 
heard Jack Brown call out, 
" 
There's a 
dog got hold of me by the call " 
Thro' going, & c. 
I 
didn't want a 
bite, so I 
took to my ' eels, 
When the owner of the dog came in sight, 
The Joskin of a 
clown, in a 
ditch ran me down, 
And I 
got the worse of the fight. 
We fought like bricks till I 
got a 
fearful black eye, 
Which at once put an end to the war, 
And then he said to Brown, when next you gents come down, 
I 
can promise yet a 
few bites more. 
When going, & c. 
We somehow hobbled off, got on the towing path, 
Of having better luck then in hope. 
And soon I 
got a 
bite, but never got a 
sight 
Of a 
barge bein ,, pulled by a 
rope 
I 
found I'd hook'd a 
fish, mid heard Brown call out, 
lie's a 
whacker—keep your rod a 
little bent, 
While both brimful of hope— behind us came the rope, 
And slap into the river we went. 
Through going, & c. 
'When both were nearly drowned, the barge-man got its out. 
And we vowed we'd ne'er angle again, 
So we ran about three miles—over hedge ditch and stiles, 
Just in time to be too late for the train. 
We'd to walk all the night, ill sorrow to our homes, 
Where our wives both began to scold. 
You may call fishing sport, by what we really caught, 
Was a 
scolding and a 
jolly bad coll.

SKATING ON THE ICE. 
Written by ALBERT LEIGHTON. 
One morning when I 
rose from bed 
1 
looked into the yard, 
And found to my intense delight, 
That it was freezing hard; 
at course I 
quickly donned my clothes, 
And off I 
went in a 
trice, 
To Regent's Park there to enjoy, 
A skate upon the Ice. 
CHORUS. 
Skating on the Ice in the Park, lads 
Skating on the Ice in the Park, lads 
I 
never shall forget, the charming girl I 
met, 
When skating on the Ice in the Park, lads. 
Already thousands had arrived, 
That charming spot to try, 
But soon amid that motley throng 
A damsel caught my eye, 
With sealskin hat and jacket too, 
She really looked so nice, 
As like a 
fawn she glided on, 
While skating on the ice. 
Skating on the ice, Lic. 
I 
followed her where'er she went, 
I 
could not go away, 
In fact I 
could have followed her 
For ever and a 
day; 
She neared a 
spot marked " Dangerous," 
Unheeding the advice, 
She onward sped and with a 
scream 
She sank beneath the Ice. (Skating on the, &c. 
Towards the place I 
madly rushed 
That lovely girl to save, 
Then in I 
plunged and soon a 
sigh 
Of satisfaction gave, 
I 
found her, clasped her in my arms. 
There held her like a 
vice. 
And with her quickly made my way 
From underneath the ice. 
Skating on the, & c. 
Of course I 
went to see her home, 
We made love on the way, 
And often I 
have called to see 
My darling' since that day, 
It is arranged that I 
shall wed 
That little pearl of price, 
I 
saved her life and won a 
wife, 
When skating on the Ice. (Skating on tne, &c.

THE DAISY VALLEY.-
I

I 
felt that I 
must love her, yes, if she would or no; 
It was a 
happy day, full well, full well, I 
know, 
I 
met her in the valley where the daisies grow. 
She was fair to me, as fair as fair can be, 
No damsel yet was half so fair as she; 
She vowed that she'd be true to me 
Down in the valley where the daisies grow, 
CHORUS. 
The daisies oh I

Down in the valley where the daisies grow; 
It was a

And where beside a 
streamlet the water-lilies blow; 
It was a 
happy moment when first she let me know 
She lov'd me in the valley where the daisies grow, 
Ah, 'twas a 
joy to me, my heart was full of glee, 
When she agreed my loving bride to be,' 
And vow`d that she'd be true to me, 
Down in the valley where the daisies grow. 
The daisies oh! the daisies oh! 
Down in the valley where the daisies grow; 
It was a

Waiting in the garden down beside the stile, 
For a 
little maiden with a 
winning smile, 
Nothing e'se can cheer me now I 
feel so gay, 
Since my darling Emma came and stole my heart away 
We strolled along together many things discussed,

She blushed and look'd so roguish saying with a 
smile, 
To morrow nigl.t at seven meet me at the stile.

BLUE-EYED SALLY. 
Written, composed and sung by GEORGE HERBERT. 
You've heard it sung a 
hundred times, 
flow fellows fall in love, 
But the other night my heart was won, 
By a 
pretty little dove ; 
Oh, she keeps an Ice cream shop, • 
And she is a 
charming gal, 
And by all her customers she's known, 
As pretty blue-eyed Sal. 
Spoken—Yes, and the first time I 
saw her  
I 
felt so jolly happy, I 
feel so jolly gay, 
I 
do not care a 
jot whatever people say, 
My heart is light and merry, I'm singing all the day, 
Since pretty blue-eyed Sally stole my heart away. 
Into the shop I 
strolled one night, 
It being rather hot, 
And kindly said to her-
-What refreshment have you got ? 
She said, Sir, I 
have everything, 
That in this world is nice, 
But the stuff that will just Fnit you. 
Is a 
glass of Strawberry Ice. 
Spoken—Fancy a 
charming creature coming up to you and saying, 
" 
My dear fellah, what will you take ? I 
have everything that's nice, 
—Why you would say, give me your three-penny-worth of the lady's 
fancy, I 
will bet it would make you 
• Feel so jolly, & c. 
The Ice I 
quickly had and 
Called for more and more, 
My love was growing rather hot, 
For her I 
did adore. 
I 
thought of a 
happy home, 
And comforts of a 
married life, 
So I 
whispered o'er the counter, 
Dearest, will you be my wile 7 
Spoken—That word " will you" knocked her clean off her feet, but 
she like a 
sensible woman soon came round, I 
never knew a

chance of being made

Feel so jelly, &c. 
Spoken— This is the touching part, don't cry, 
She blIsled and took me there and then, 
As her lover kind and true, 
And when we are married, boys,

I'll open a 
fine shop, and sell 
Everything that's nice, 
And bless the happy day

PRETTY POLLY BANGLE; 
OR, MANGLING DONE HERE. 
Written and composed by G. W. 11uNT. 
I'm a 
flower cut down in the bloom of my youth, 
And all through a 
damsel who spoke not the truth; 
in a 
snug little house lived the one I 
held dear, 
And over the door it said, " Mangling done here." 
Whenever I 
pass,d pretty Polly I'd see, 
A-turning her mangle, which quite mangled me, 
To think such sweet hands such hard work endured, 
And thus ' twas I 
loved her, and would not be cured. 
CHORUS. 
Pretty Polly Bangle 
Used to turn a 
mangle, 
But she's sold her old mangle and bought a 
piano, 
And married the Marquis of Camden Town. 
One day I 
spoke to her, with love did I 
burn, 
Said 1, you look tired, miss, let me have turn: 
She smiled a 
consent, and to work I 
did go, 
How long I 
was at it I 
really don't kuow; 
I 
soon felt fatigued, but I 
didn't care, 
I'd have turned for a 
month her sweet presence to share 
At last I 
fell on my knees and while on the floor, 
told her I 
loved her and would evermore. 
Pretty Polly Bangle 
Used to turn a 
mangle, 
But she's sold her old mangle and bought a 
piano, 
And married the Marquis of Whitechapel Road. 
PRETT 
Y FOLLY BANGLE. [Commum. 
I'd go there every day, and I'd turn for my life, 
At length she consented that she'd be my wife; 
I 
was happy until I 
was told one find day, 
Someone else turned her mangle when I 
was away. 
I 
told pretty Polly the tale I 
had heard, 
She said, 'twas redekclus, horful, habsurd ;" 
Said I, I've your promise and hope you're sincere, 
For if I've a 
rival, there'll be Mangling done here.

Pretty Polly Bangle, 
Used to turn a 
Mangle, 
But she's sold her old Mangle and bought a 
Piano, 
And married the Marquis of Bloo 
bury Square. 
After that she appeared to quite change in her manner, 
She sold her old Mangle and bought a 
Pianner, 
Now, I 
couldn't turn that, and—ah, me, one day, 
I 
found her honse closed and my love gone away; 
They say she's retired from mangling for life, 
That some Duke or some Marquis has made her his W ; 
SO 
I 
sighs and I 
mourns, and oft drop a 
tear, 
When I 
think of my love, and the Mangling done here.

LITTLE THINGS. 
As little things are all the rage 
To please this little throng ; 
And, as I'm on this little stage 
I'll sing a 
little song. 
Oh! oftimes a 
little trouble, 
Often little sorrow brings; 
It'll give you a 
few little lines, 
On little funny things. 
The little ladies of the day, 
Their little figures dash on, 
They have such funny little ways, 
And they like a 
little fashion. 
And as they cross the little streets 
They look like little pegs, 
And when they raise their little skirts, 
They show their little legs. 
There was a 
very little maid, 
Looked like a 
little dove, 
This little maid felt very queer, 
She telt a 
little love. 
There was a 
very little man, 
Said he felt a 
little smart, 
He told this pretty little maid 
That she'd stole his little heart. 
And, now this very little maid, 
So says my little song; 
She believed this little man, 
And she done a 
little wrong. 
And, oh, this pretty little maid, 
She grew a 
little wavy, 
And so after a 
little time, 
She found a 
little baby. 
And now this very little man, 
After the little wrong he'd done 
From this naughty little maid, 
This little man did run. 
Oh! he would not a 
little pay, 
To buy little baby frocks. 
They sent him then a 
little way, 
To crack the little rocks. 
Now all you very little men, 
Just let the little ladies be; 
Unless babies you will nurse, 
Why cracking little stones you'll be. 
Now listen to this little moral, 
You pretty little ladies, 
Ann never walk with little men, 
If you're not fond of little babies.

THERE'S NOTHING OF THAT ABOUT 311E. 
Written, composed, and sung by J. W OOD. 
FM a 
single young chap in search of a 
wife, 
From the country I 
just have come; 
In London I'm told—at least, heard it said, 
There are plenty of girls full of fun. 
For I'm a 
jolly young chap in my way, 
Though by some l'm call'd too free, 
But I'm neither proud nor gay, 
No! there's nothing of that about me, 
For I'm a 
jolly, Itc. 
To make a 
girl happy for life, 
My intentions you'll find they are true, 
For there are plenty who live on in strife, 
And wish they never had woo'd. 
My heart I'll give with my hand, 
And steady and constant will be, 
I'm not fond of doing the grand, 
No there's nothing of that about me. 
For I'm a 
jolly, dm 
There are many who are fond of fine clothes, 
And think if they only- dress well, 
The girls will admire their show, 
And be enamoured to walk with a 
swell. 
I 
don't think they could e'er have been to school, 
Or what they have learned I 
can't see, 
it's through pride I 
suppose they so act the fool, 
But there's nothing of that about me, 
For I'm a 
jolly, & c. 
Some people are always complaining, 
At the trouble they have to go through, 
Then take my advice and cease crying. 
For I'm sure that will never help you, 
You will never get through it by fretting, 
And sorry at heart you will be, 
If my motto you are it forgetting, 
For there's nothing of that about me. 
For I'm a 
jolly, Sce.. 
So now if there's any young lady here, 
Who to marry does feel inclined. 
I 
hope she'll speak for once quite clear, 
And not afterwards change her mind. 
I'm not seeking for one who has wealth in galore 
For with that we ne'er happy could be, 
Or one that would alway be pining for more, 
No! there's nothing of that about me. 
For I'm a 
jolly, tte. 
That is known unto 
you,

A SHILLING OR TWO.—[CONCLUDED.1 
Now if you your friends would try, 
There's but one thing to do, 
Just ask them to lend you 
But a 
shilling or two. 
And you will find your sworn friends 
Turn their backs upon you, 
For it is dreadful to want 
Just a 
shilling or two. 
C'liorus.—A shilling or two, a 
shilling or two, 
Friends can be bought for a 
shilling or two; 
Yes, yes, it is true, you '11 find it is true, 
Friends can be sold for a 
shilling or two. 
Now, pray, do girls wed for love, 
Well p'rhaps some of them do, 
But they more often do wed 
Just a 
shilling or two. 
But mind, most men are the same, 
But their folly they rue, 
Because real joy is not bought 
For a 
shilling or two. 
Chorus.—A 
shilling or two, a 
shilling or two, 
It oft proves a 
curse, a 
shilling or two; 
Young maidens are bought, and young men sold too; 
And all for what, just a 
shilling or two. 
Perhaps you may think it strange, 
Yet still it is true, 
But I'm singing these few lines 
For a 
shilling or two. 
And I've not been backbiting, 
For, search the wide world through, 
And all men you '11 see fighting 
For a 
shilling or two. 
Chorus.—A 
shilling or two, a 
shilling or two, 
Wonderful charms has a 
shilling or two; 
It buys things on earth, that 's 
all it can do : 
But heaven's not bought for a 
shilling or two.

THE DETECTIVE'S SONG. 
When information I 
receive that Jones has been a 
forging, 
And on the proceeds of his crime, is prodigally gorging, 
Do you suppose I 
collar ray friend and take him to the beak 
Ma'am; 
Why bless your heart they wouldn't retain me in the force a 
week, Ma'am. 
In curious wig and quaint disguise and strangely alter'd face, 
Ma'am; 
Unrecognis'd I 
followed my prey about from place to place, 
Ma'am; 
I 
note his hair, his eyes, his nose, his clothing and complexion, 
And when I've got 'em all into my head, I 
set about detection. 
I 
take his servants, one by one, and bring them all to book; 
Ma'am; 
Both man and maid of every grade particularly his cook, Ma'am; 
His tradesmen then I 
call upon, examine them on their oaths, 
Ma'am; 
And the elderly man of the Hebrew clan, who buys his left-off 
clothes, Ma'am. 
His father-in-law, perhaps, is buffalo-hunting in the prairies. 
His aunt may keep a 
lodging-house in the ocean.girt Canaries; 
His uncle's out in Honolulu, his niece in arctic zones, Ma'am ; 
I 
find them out and talk to them before arresting Jones, Ma'am. 
And when my case is quite complete, and home again I 
fly, Ma'am, 
I 
find that Jones has gone abroad, some people are so sly, Ma'am) 
But I've this consolation all the facts I've collated, 
Would surely have transported Jones, if Jones had on'y waited. 
THE POTTERY GIRLS. 
To sing a 
song of Pottery girls, 
I 
have come here to-night. 
With their eyes like diamonds, teeth like pearls; 
They form a 
pretty sight. 
And who in our hearts should e'er be first, 
In life's sudden changes and whirls, 
So sing a 
song to you I 
must, 
Of the dear little pottery girls. 
CHORUS. 
The pottery girls, the pottery girls, 
Eyes like diamonds, teeth like pearls, 
Buckles on their shoes, hair in curls, 
What darling little creatures are the pottery girls. 
At nine o'clock each morning, 
They roam along the street, 
All thought of danger scorning, 
They look a 
perfect treat. 
And as they pass each gay young spark 
Oh! don't they use their eyes, 
Some look very saucy, 
And some look at the skies. [The pottery girls, & c. 
Their different trades I'll state and then, 
l'm sure you'll say I'm right, 
They work as hard as any men, 
From morning until night. 
Like the " Wheel of Life," they turn the lathe, 
And sing like jolly pals, 
Then where's the school can equal 
The dear little pottery girls. [The pottery grls, &c. 
Some have to stand in a 
show room 
From morning until night, 
With hair cropped up in front and a 
lump on the top. 
And squeezed in the waist very tight, 
And some at Biscuit earn their bread, 
While others paint I'm told, 
And others burnish up the gilt, 
But they are all as good as gold. 
The pottery girls, dm 
But now I 
must be going. 
For soon I 
am to be wed, 
To one of these dear pottery girls, 
Who earns her datly bread. 
She gets her eighteen bob a 
week 
On which she lives quite well, 
And if you want to know her name 
Of course I 
will not tell. [The pottery girls; (tic.

DOWN AMONG THE COALS. 
My Jemitna was in service once 
At a 
house in Madis.m Square, 
She never got out and so I 
used 
To go and court her there. 
Her mistresses were two old maids, 
Such very particular souls, 
That Jemima had to often hide me 
in amongst the coals. 
CIIGRUS.—Down among the coals, down among the coals, 
Oh, by Jove it was a 
lark, all alone and in the dark, 
Down among the coals, down among the coals, 
Waiting to make love to my Jemima. 
When in that cellar, cobwebs used 
To decorate my clothes, 
The coal-dust got into my eyes, 
And would get up my nose; 
And when it rain 'd 
the water came 
A 
trickling through a 
crack, 
And I 
always fancied spiders were 
A 
crawling down my back. 
Down among the coals, tke. 
One night they sent Jemima out, 
Who'd forgotten her dear Joe 
Was down among the Wallsends 
And a 
prisoner below. 
I 
began to freeze, was obliged t ) sneeze 
And felt inclined to shout, 
At last call'd thro' the keyhole, 
"Here Jemima let's get out." 
Down among the coals, itc. 
At last the door was opened, 
'Twas dark, oh blest of bliss. 
I 
threw my arms around her neck, 
And gave her such a 
kiss.

WEBSTER'S BUSINESS MAN 
treats upon every topic incidental 
to the experience of a 
business 
man. While 
its main design is to instruct the 
reader in the details of commercial correspondence, the subject matter of these 
specimen letters embrace all points of interest to the general trader. 
Prominence has been given to banking, and the relationship between bank-
ers and their dealers, inasmuch as hundreds of thousands of persons main-
taining accounts of deposit and discount, are in ignorance of the duties of 
bankers and of the the rights and privileges of the dealer. 
To the body of the work has been appended:— 
I. A Glossary of the Technicalities of Commerce, or terms employed by mer-
cantile men at home and abroad, as a 
peculiar and distinctive language not 
familiar to the general reader. 
2. A table of moneys in which mercantile accounts are kept in various 
foreign countries, information all important to dealers in imported merchan-
dise; end 
3. Several farms of important documents not to be found in a 
majority of 
,vorks upon book-keeping. 
This work has been submitted to the perusal of several of our most eminent 
bankers and traders, and has invariably met with their approval. 
This Book contains over 200 pares, bound in boards, with a 
splendid illum-
inated cover.
