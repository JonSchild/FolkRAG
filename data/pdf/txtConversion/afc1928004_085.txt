ALICE GRAY. 
She's all my fancy painted her, 
She's lovely, she's divine; 
But her heart it is another's, 
She never can be mine. 
Yet loy'd I 
as man never lov'd, 
A 
love without decay: 
Oh ! my heart, my heart is breaking, 
For the love of Alice Gray. 
Oh! my heart, &c. 
Her dark brown hair is braided o'er 
A brow of spotless white; 
Her soft blue eye now languishes, 
Now flashes with delight; 
The hair is braided not for me, 
The eye is turned away; 
Yet my heart, my heart is breaking, 
For the love of Alice Gray. 
Yet my heart, Sze. 
I've sunk beneath the summer's sun, 
And trembled in the blast; 
But my pilgrimage is nearly done, 
The weary conflict past 
And when the green sod wraps my grave, 
May Pity haply say, 
Oh t 
his heart, his heart is broken, 
For the love of Alice Gray. 
Oh 1 
his heart, &c.

OVER THE SUMMER SEA.. 
Over the summer sea, with light hearts gay and free, 
Join'd by glad minstrelsy, gaily we're roaming; 
Swift flows the rippling tide, lightly the zephyrs glide, 
Round Us on every side bright eresis are foaming. 
Fond hearts entwining, cease all repining, 
Near us is shining Beauty's bright smile. 
Ah I 
Beauty's bright smile! 
List there's a 
bird on high, far in yon azure sky, 
Flinging sweet melody, each heart to glidden; 
Hark ! its songs seems to say, " Banish dull care away! 
Never let sorrow stay, brief joys to sadden." 
Fond hearts entwining, who'd be repining, 
While near is shining Beauty's bright smile ? 
Ah ! Beauty's bright smile! 
-GIPSY DAVY. 
The Music of this song is published by OLIVER DiTsos & CO., 277 
Washington Street ,Boston, Mass. Price 30 cents.] 
There was a 
lord, a 
high burn lord, 
He loved n 
high born lady, 
She lived in a 
palace all so grand, 
Till she met with the Gipsy Davy. 
CHORUS. 
Elopements now are all the go, 
They set the ladies crazy, 
Now then ladies all beware, 
And look out for Gipsy Davy. 
'This lord he was a-nice young man 
He set this lady crazy, 
She pack'd up her duds 'and away she ran 
Along with the Gipsy Davy. 
Elopements now, &c. 
Her parients ravel and tored their hair 
When they found they had lost their baby, 
To think that that high born lady 
Would run off with the Gipsy Davy. 
Elopements now, &e. 
'Last night she lay on a 
vlean feather bed 
And in her arms a 
baby, 
-To-night she will lay on the cold cold ground 
And so will the Gipsy Davy. 
Elopements now, &c. 
How could she leave her house and. lands 
How could she leave her 'baby, 
How could she leave her own true lord 
For .
1,0 run off with the Gipsy Davy. 
Elopements now, ttc.

TWILrGHT DEWS. 
When twilight dews are falling fast 
Upon the rosy sea, 
I 
watch that star whose beam so oft 
Has lighted me to thee; 
And thou, too, on that orb so dear. 
Ah! do'st thou gaze at even, 
And think tho' lost forever here, 
Thoult yet be mine in heaven! 
There's not a 
garden walk I 
tread, 
There's not a 
flow'r I 
see, 
But brings to mind some hope that's fled, 
Some joy I've lost with thee; 
And still.' wish that hour was near, 
When friends and foes forgiven, 
The pains, the ills we've wept thro' here, 
May turn to smiles in heaven I 
ROBIN ADATR. 
What's this dull town to me? Robin's not near. 
What was't I 
wished to see ? what wished to hear ? 
Where's all the joy and mirth made this town a 
heaven on earth ? 
Oh they're all fled with thee, Robin Adair 1 
What made the assembly shine ? Robin Adair! 
What made the ball so fine? Robin was there! 
What, when the play was o'er, -what made my heart so sore ? 
Oh I 
it was parting with Robin Adair! 
But now thou'rt cold to me, Robin Adair! 
But now thou'rt cold to me, Robin Adair! 
Yet he I 
loved so well, still in my heart shall dwell I 
Oh 1 
I 
can ne'er forget Robin Adair.

But while you thus tease me together, 
To neither a

And with thee my heart it would ever 
Its love and affection convey.

To charm me by night and by day; 
To be to each one a

NOLLY PUT THE SETTLE ON 
Molly, put the kettle on; why don't you put the kettle on 
Molly, put the kettle on; we'll all take tea. 
Sukey, take it off again; why don't you take it off again ? 
Sukey, take it off again; for they are all gone away. 
Now put flown the ginger-cake, now put down the ginger-cake. 
Stir the fire, and let it bake; and we'll all take tea. 
Put the muffins dawn to roast, put the muffins down to roast, 
Blow the fire, and make the toast.; and we'll all take tea. 
Dolly, set the table out; Dolly, set the table out; 
Move the Ashes all about; and we'll all take tea.

DOWN THE RIVER. 
Oh I 
the river is up, and the channel is deep, 
And the wind blows steady and strong; - 
Let the splash of your oars the measure keep, 
As we row the old boat along. 
Oh 1 
the water is bright and flashing like gold 
In the rays of the morning sun: 
And old Dinah's away, up out of the cold,. 
A-gotting the hoe-cake done. 
Oh ! the river is up, and the channel is deep, 
And the wind blows steady and strong; 
Let the splash of your oars the measure keep, 
As we row the old boat along. 
CHORUS. 
Down the- river, down the river, 
Down the Ohio; 
• 
Down the river, down the river, 
Down the Ohio. 
Repeat:, 
Oh!Alio master is" proud of the old Iitoad-horn, 
For it gives him plenty of tin ; 
Oh.t the crew they are darkies, the cargo's corn, 
And the money comes tumbling in. 
There's plenty on board f3r the darkies to eat, 
And there's something to drink and to smoke', 
There's Cie banjo, the bones, and the tambourine, 
There's the song, and the comical joke. 
Oh ! the river is up, and the channel is deep, 
And the wind blows steady and strong, 
Let the splash of your oars the measure keep, 
As we row the old boat along. 
Down the river, down the river, 
Down the Ohio; 
Down the river, down the river, 
Down the Ohio. 
Repeat, 
GRANDMOTHER'S ADVICE. 
I 
lived with my grandma on yondel little green, 
She's the nicest old lady that ever was seen; 
She taught me fine lessons of prudence and cave, 
She bade above all things of young men beware 
Of young men to beware, 
Of young men to beware, 
And she bade me ' bove all things of young men to beware. 
These false young men they flatter and deceive, 
So, my dearest Eliza, you must not believe: 
They'll flatter, they'll coax, 'till you are in their snare, 
And away goes poor old grandma's care, 
Poor old Grandma's care, 
Poor old Grandma's care, 
And. away goes poor old Grandma's care. 
The first came a-courtin,g was litle Johnny Green, 
Fine young mau as ever was seen; 
But the words of my Grandma did run in my head, 
And I 
could not hear one word that he said, 
One word that he said, 
One word that ho said, 
And I 
could not hear one word that he said. 
The next came a- courting was young Ellis Grove, 
'Twas then we met with a 
joyous love; 
f 
With a 
joyous love I 
could not be afraid, 
You'd better get married than die an old. maid. 
Than die an old maid, 
Than die an old maid, 
Better get married than die an old maid. 
Oh! dear, what a 
fuss these old women do make 
I 
wish in my heart, they would make a 
mistake. 
If all the young women of young men were afraid, 
Then Grandma herself would have died an old maid. 
Would have died an old maid, 
Would have died an old maid, 
Then Grandma herself would have died an old maid.

'TIS HOME WHERE THE HEART IS 
'Tis home where e'er the heart is, 
' 
Where e'er it's loved ones dwell, 
In, cities, or in cottages, 
Throng'd haunts or mossy dell, 
The heart's a 
rover ever, 
And thus on wave. and wild, 
The maiden with her lover walks, 
The mother with her child. 
'Tis bright where e'er the heart is, 
It's fairy spell can bring 
Fresh fountains to the wilderness,. 
And to the desert spring. 
Green isles are in the Ocean, 
O'er which affection glides; 
A haven on each sunny shore, 
When love's the sun that guides. 
Tis free where e'er the heart is. 
Nor chains, nor dungeon's dim 
May cheek the mind's aspiring thought 
The spirit's pealing hymn. 
The heart gives life its beauty, 
Its glory and ta power; 
'Tis sunlight to its rippling stream, 
And soft dew to its flowers.

I'D OFFEB THEE THIS HAND OF NINE 
I'd offer thee this hand of mine, 
If I 
could love thee less; 
But heart no warm and pure as thine 
Should never know distress. 
Ily fortune ' tis too hard for thee, 
'rwould. chill thy dearest joy, 
I'd rather weep to see thee free, 
Than win thee to destroy, 
I'd offer thee, hz. 
'I leave thee to thy happiness,' 
As one too dear to love, 
.As one I 
think-of but to bless,' 
As wretchedly I 
rove. 
But, oh! when sorrow's cup I 
drink, 
Alt I 
bitter though it be, 
now sweet 'twill be 'for me to think 
it holds no drop for thee. 
I'd offer thee, 
And now my dreams are sadly o'er, 
Fate bids them all depart; 
And I 
must leave my native shore 
in brokenness of heart. 
Then, oh! dear one, when far from thee, 
I 
no'cr know joy again, 
I 
would not that one thought of me, 
Should give thy bosom pain. I'd offer thee, &e. 
TilY OWN NATIVE LAND. 
rVO roved over TOOTilltahl, 
CTOSSCd Over wood, 
I've traversed the wave-rolling sand ; 
Though the fields were as green, and the moon shone as bright, 
Yet it was nut my own native land. 
No, no, no, no, 110-110, 110, 110, 110, 110! 
Though the fields were as green, and the moon shone as bright, 
Yet it was not my own native land. 
The right band of friendship how oft I 
have grasped, 
And bright eyes have smiled and looked bland; 
Yet happier far were the hours that I 
passed 
In the West--in my own native land. 
Yes, yes, yes. yes, yes—yes, yes, yes, yes. yes! 
Yet happier far were the hours that I

in the -West—in my own native land,

Methought the stars were blinking bright, 
And the old brig's sails unfurld ; 
I 
said, 
I 
will sail to my love this night, 
To the other side of the world." 
I 
stepp'd aboard,—we said so fast, 
The sun shot up from the bonnie ; 
But a 
dove that perched upon the mast; 
Did mourn, and mourn, and mourn. 
O 
fair dove! 0 
fond dove! 
And dove with the white, white breast 
Let me alone, the dream is my own, 
And my heart is full of rest. 
My true Jove fares on this great hilt, 
Feeding his sheep for aye; 
I 
look'd in: his hut, but all was still, 
My love was gone away. 
I 
went to gaze in the forest creek, 
And the dove mourn'd on a-pace; 
No flame did flash, nor fair blue reek, 
Rose up to show me his place. 
O 
last love ! 0 
first love! 
My love with the true, true heart ! 
To think I 
have come to this your home, 
And yet we are apart. 
My love! he stood at my right hand, 
His eyes were grave and sweet ; 
Methought he said, " In this far land, 
Oh, is it thus we meet ! 
0, maid, most dear, I 
am not here, 
I 
have no place, no part, 
No dwel ing more by sea or shore 
But only in thy heart." 
O 
fair dove ! 0 
fond dove ! 
Till night rose over the bourne, 
The dove on the mast, as we sail'd fast, 
Did mown, and mourn, and mourn. 
PARODY ON BEN BOLT. 
Oh, don't you remember the b'boys, Jim Holmes, 
The bloys with noses so red ? 
Who drank with delight whenever they met, 
And always went drunk to bed ; 
In the old grave-yard, at the edge of the town, 
In corners obscure and alone. 
They have gone to rest, for the gay young sprigs 
have dropped off one by one. 
Oh, don't you remember the jug, Jim Holmes, 
And the spring at the foot of the hill, 
Where we have lain through the hot summer hou 
And drank to our utmost fill ? 
The spring is filled with mud, Jim Holmes, . 
And the wild hogs root all around, 
And the good old jug, with whiskey so sweet, 
Lies broken and spilled on the ground. 
Oh, don't you remember the tavern, Jim Holmes, 
And the bar-keeper kind and true. 
The little nook at the end of the bar, 
Where we drank the wine that we drew? 
The tavern is burned to the ground, Jim Holmes, 
And the bottles are cracked and dry, 
And of all the boys who spreed it then, 
There remains, Jim, but you and I. 
BONNY MAE. 
In the sweet blooming valley, ah I 
down by the wood, 
There's a 
cottage with roses and vines covered o'er, 
And there dwelleth a 
fairy in that loved abode, 
Bonny Mae, the sweet maiden who sings by the door. 
cuonus. 
Bonny Mae ! Bonny Mae ! 
Wherever I 
roam and whatever my lot, 
Sweet hope in my bosom to thee turn for aye, 
Bonny Mae, the fairy, and little low cot. 
As I 
go in the morning to call home the kine, 
In the garden I 
see her a-culling sweet flowers: 
As I 
come, I 
oft linger 'neath low jessamine, 
And thus fly, with the fairy, the gay rosy hours. 
Bonny Mae, &c. 
Oh ! the blithe little maiden, with lips of the rose, 
With a 
kind beatine• bosom, and blue beaming eyes: 
Without her the earth were a 
desert of woes— 
But 'tis with her a 
garden, a 
bright paradise !

DAY AND NIGHT I THOUGHT OF THEE." 
I 
thought of thee, I 
thought of thee, 
On ocean many a 
weary night, 
When heav'd the long and sulien sea, 
With only waves and stars in sight. 
We stole along by isles of balm, 
We furled before the coming gale, 
We slept amid the breathless calm, 
We flew beneath the straining sail ; 
But thou wort lost for years to me, 
And day and night I 
thought of thee.

I've thought of thee, I've thought of thee, 
Thro' change that teaches to forget; 
Thy face looks up from Wry sea, 
In eV'ry star thine eyes are set. 
Thro' roving 'neath those Eastern skies, 
Whose golden beauty breathes of rest, 
I 
envy every bird that flies, 
To my dear home the sunny West, 
I

She's bare-footed and pretty, she's lively and witty,

I HEARD A SPIRIT SING.

It might have been a 
fancy, 
Or it might have been a 
dream, 
But I'll ne'er forget the beauty 
Of the voice or of the theme: 
I 
was sitting at my lattice, 
One fair night in budding spring, 
When a 
flood of light fell o'er me, 
And I 
heard a 
spirit sing: 
CHORUS. 
"Come away! Come away! 
To the land of light and beauty, 
Come away! Come away I" 
While the weary zephyrs slumbered 
In the shady summer bowers, 
And the air was lotus laden 
With perfumed breath of flowers; 
While the birds bathed in the brooklet 
And the tired bee dro( pod its wing, 
Sudden music swept the silence, 
And I 
heard a 
spirit sing: 
Come away! &c. 
True, it might have been a 
fancy, 
Or it might have been a 
dream; 
But I'll ne'er forget the beauty 
Of the voice or of the theme; 
And, come storm, come strife, come shadow, 
I 
can conquer while I 
cling 
To the happy memory-moments 
When I 
heard a 
spirit sing: 
Come away! &c

LOOK AT THE CLOCK 
AIR.—" Groves of Blarney." 
Young ladies tarry, think ere you marry, 
A 
lesson pray take from what I 
sing, 
For though black slaves are, of course unknown here, 
We wives, you 11 find are the slaves of the ring. 
Our husbands nightly very impolitely, 
With their companionc abroad will roam, 
Of us ne'er thinking, they go off drinking, 
While we are crying our eyes out at home. 
CHORUS. 
Think, think, how slowly the moments pass, 
While you're enjoying your pipe and glass, 
Think, think, bow slowly the moments pass, 
Now, gentlemen, pray mind what I 
say and look, look at 
the clock. 
Now, thus to leave us and :so deceive us, — 
l'm sure you'll own a 
monstrous sin, 
For there's no knowing where you are going, 
Or what bad company you may get in, 
For when you tell us, deceitful fellows, 
That at your club you have passed the night, 
At that saloon oh, you are often seen oh, 
You must acknowledge that is not right. 
Think, think, & c. 
Then when returning, we're soon discerning 
That in your manner there's something queer, 
You whisper" salmon," but that's all gammon, 
It's something stronger than that I 
fear. 
It must be really, for when awaking, 
A noise you are making for a " cup of tea," 
You didn't ought to want soda water, 
Through eating salmon you must agree. 
Think, think, &e. 
The cradle rocking or mending stocking, 
The time we strive hard to pass away, 
While you are flirting, your health, too, hurting, 
By staying out till the break of day, 
Besides suspicions will sometimes enter our heads 
While sitting up waiting alone, 
About your latch keys, for who's to know pray, 
Whose doors they open beside your own. 
Think; think, & c.

Last night I 
was dreaming of you, 
And bright happy moments gone by, 
We trod the old paths that we know, 
Ere absence has caused us to sigh, 
Kind friends and companions were near, 
A merry and mirth- loving throng, 
With links of relationship dear, 
That bin 1 
us life's pathway along,

was dreaming of you. 
I 
saw the sweet smile that you wore, 
As you gazed on the friends we knew;

An outeast's lot is hard, to meet the proud world's scorn, 
And suffer starvation s

And grant that in the better world they ne'er know want again.

To the town° where shee was dwellin', 
You must come to my master deare,

For death be printed on his face, 
And, ore his heart is stealin: 
Then haste away to comfort him

Tho' death be printed on his face, 
And ore his hearte is stealing, 
But little better shall he bee, 
For bonny Barb'ra Allen. 
So slowly, slowly, she came up, 
And. slowly she came nye him; 
And all she sayed, when there she came, 
Young man, I 
think y'are dying. 
He turned. his face unto her strait, 
With deadly sorrow sighing;

lovely maid, come pity mee, 
I'm on my death- bed lying. 
If on your death-bed you doe lye, 
'What needs the tale you're telling;

And spied the corps a

When he was dead, and laid in grave, 
Her harte was struck with sorrowe,

She, on her death-bed as she laye, 
Beg'd to be buried by him;

As she was walking ore the fields 
She heard the bell a

And every stroke did seem to say°,

With scornful eye she looked downe 
Her cheek with laughter swellin; 
Whilst all her friends cried out, amain°,

The lord in courtly castle,. 
And the squire in stately hall; 
The great of name, of birth and fame, 
On John for succour call. 
He bids the troubled heart rejoice, 
Gives warmth . to natures cold; 
Makes weak men strong, and old one's young, 
And all men brave and bold. 
Hey, John Barleycorn, & 
Then shout for great John Barleycorn, 
Nor heed the luscious vine; 
I've not the mind, much charm to find, 
In potent draughts of wine. 
Give me my native nut brown ale, 
All other drinks I 
scorn ; 
True English cheer is English beer, 
Our own John Barleycorn. 
Hey, John Barleycorn, &c.

The other day as I 
was strolling, 
Somewhere down Broadway, 
I 
saw a 
cab come flying by, 
I 
hailed it right away; 
Then in I 
sprang, and said — 
" 
Pray drive to Brook street, number three; 
And when we had arrived there, 
SPOKEN—I 
said, "Cabby 
would you be so kind if you please, 
as to—" 
Put it down to me; Yes— 
CIIORUS. 
Put it down to me, sir, 
Put it down to me; 
I 
tick like a 
chronometer, 
So put it down to me. 
One wet day I 
was tripping 
'Cross the top of Fourteenth street, 
When one of those street-sweepers swept 
The dirt upon my feet; 
I 
hailed a 
little blacking boy, 
Who brushed away with glee, 
And after he had shined my boots, 
Sroxrx—I said, " Blacking-boy would you be so kind if you 
please, as to" 
Put it down to me; Yes— 
Put it down, cte. 
I. 
wanted much to come to town 
By the last express; 
I 
always make a 
point of traveling 
First class, as you'd guess— 
I_said,—First class to York, sir;" 
He said ""Iwould cost a 
V ;" 
PUT IT DOWN TO ME.—(CoNcLuDED.) 
Then I 
snatched up my ticket and the cash, 
SPOKEN—And said, " Ticket-seller— I'll tick it—so would you 
be so kind, if you please, as to" 
Put it down to me. 
Put it down, ttc. 
One day when in my dog-cart, 
A 
toll-gate did appear; 
I 
slightly slackened my pace, 
Of course, on drawing near; 
The toll-gate man stood ready 
To receive from me his fee, 
But, as I 
gave my horse its head, 
SPOKEN—I 
said, " Toll gate man 1 
would you be so kind, if you 
please, as to" 
Put it down to me; Yes— 
Put it down, &e. 
To-night, when I 
arrived here, 
I 
found I 
had no tin, 
But, as of course, you'll guess, my friends, 
I 
wanted to come in; 
The man who sells the tickets, 
He handed one to me; 
I 
took it, and said, " Thank you, sir, 
SPOKEN—" I 
have no change about me just now, so would yon 
be so kind, if you please, as to" 
Put it down to me; Yes— 
Put it down, 
I 
have no more to tell you, 
So I 
think I'd better stop; 
Or, as they have it in the trade, 
I'd better "shut up shop—" 
But you all do look so jolly, 
And laugh so much at me; 
If you'd like to have a 
glass all 'round 
SPOREN—" Ill tell you what you may do, audience, if you nay 
you may" 
Put it clown to me; Yes— 
Put it down, dm. 
The marriage rite is over; 
And though I 
turn aside, 
To keep the guests from seeing 
The tears I 
could not hide, 
I 
wreathed my face in smiling, 
And led my little brother, 
To greet my father's chosen ; 
But I 
cou,d not call her Modica'? 
She is a 
fair young creature, 
'With meek and gentle air ; 
With blue eyes soft and loving, 
And silken sunny hair, 
I 
know my father gives her, 
The love he bore another; 
But if she were an angel, 
I 
could not call her Mother? 
To night I 
beard her singing, 
A 
song I 
used to love, 
When its sweet notes were uttered, 
By her who sings above : 
It pained my heart to hear it, 
And my tears I 
could not smother, 
For every word was hallowed, 
By the dear voice of my Mother. 
My father, in the sunshine 
Of happy days to conic, 
May half forget the shadow, 
That darkened our old home, 
His heart no more is lonely ; 
But me, and little brother, 
Must still be orphan children— 
God .cazi give us but one Motnerl 
WOODMAN SPARE THAT TREE. 
Words by G. P. 
M ORRIS. 
Music by H. Russzu,„ 
Woodman, spare that tree, 
Touch not a 
single bough, 
In youth it sheltered me, 
And I'll protect it now. 
'Twits my forefather's hand 
That placed it near his cot, 
There, woodman, let it stand, 
Thy axe shall harm it not. 
That old familiar tree, 
Whose glory and renown 
Ate spread o'er land and sea, 
Say, wouldst thou hack it down1 
Woodman, forbear thy stroke, 
Cut not its earth.bound ties, 
0, spare that aged oak, 
Now towering to the skies. 
Oft when a 
careless child, 
7, 
Beneath its shade I 
heard 
The wood- notes sweet and wild 
Of many a 
forest bird. 
My mother kissed me here, 
My father pressed my hand, 
I 
ask you with a 
tear, 
To let that old oak stand. 
My heart-strings round thee cling, 
Close to thy bark, old friend, 
Here shall the wild bird sing, 
And still thy branches bend: 
Old tree the storm still brave, 
And woodman leave the spot, 
While I've a 
hand to save, 
Thy axe shall harm it net.

LONDON SOCIETY.—{CoNcLubmi.} * 
Society has fancy fairs, for charity, of course; 
To them one has to go— the proper thing, you know; 
There Mrs. Smith, the brewer's wife, who rides the mighty 
With countesses and duchesses will show: [horse, 
They ask you from their stalls, you cannot make excuse, 
You join a 
lottery and p'rhaps you win— 
Though five pounds for a 
doll, that's not the slightest use, 
Should cover quite a 
multitude of sins 1 
Ctionus.—Baden Baden, &c. 
Society, as soon as e'er the London season's o'er, 
Will to the sea run down, where, in a 
bathing-gown, 
It dabbles in the water, or perhaps upon the shore; 
It 3 
awns and wishes it were back in town. 
Assembly balls are slow; and, though it may be nice 
To drink the nasty waters at the Spa, 
And meet the sort of men you'd cut at any price, 
The London season I 
prefer by far. 
Cnonus.—Baden Baden, &c. 
Society reads magazines; as through the list I 
range, 
My eye doth quickly rest on one, and I 
invest • 
; 
It's called " London Society,"—by Jove 
how very strange 
The title of my song should be the best; 
Its poetry is good, its pictures you should see, 
Its fund of information is a 
host— 
Henceforth I 
take it in, and once a 
month 'twill be 
Upon my table with my " Morning Post." 
Cnonus.— Baden Baden, &c. 
Society I've met with in the Highlands, 'mid the fogs, 
In Paris, ever gay, and in New York's Broadway, 
In Mont St. Bernard's Convent, with the monks and jolly dogs— 
At every place, I 
think that I 
may say. 
But there's a 
charm in town, I 
can't help saying so, 
That makes me like it more than all the rest; 
And, with a 
private box, a 
ball, and Rotten Row, 
Society in London is the best. 
CHORUS.—Baclen Baden, & c.

'TIS BUT A LITTLE FADED FLOWER. 
'Tis but a 
little faded flower, 
But, oh ! hov., fondly dear 1 
'Twill bring me back one golden hour, 
Through many a 
weary year. 
I 
may not to the world impart 
The secret of its power, 
But treasured in my inmost heart, 
I 
keep my faded flower. 
CHORUS. 
'Tis but a 
little faded flower, 
But, oh! how fondly dear, 
'Twill bring me Lack one golden hour, 
Through many a 
weary year. 
Where is the heart that doth not keep, 
Within its inmost core, 
Some fond remembrance, hidden deep, 
Of days that are no more ? 
Who hail' not saved some trifling thing, 
More prized than jewels rare? 
A faded flower a 
broken ring— 
A 
tress of golden hair ? 
'Tis but a 
little, &c.

Words by G. P. 
M ORRIS 
The young stars are glowing, 
Their clear light bestowing 
Their radiance fills the calm, clear Summer night! 
Come forth like a 
fairy, 
So blithesome and airy, 
And ramble in their soft and mystic light! 
CHORUS. 
Come, come, come, Love, come! 
Come ere the night- torches pale! 
Oh I 
come in thy beauty, 
Thou marvel of duty, 
Dear Annie, dear Annie of the Vale 1 
The world we inherit, 
Is charmed by that spirit, 
As radiant as the mild, warm Summer ray I 
The watch-door is snarling, 
For fear, Annie darlino-, 
The beautiful young friend I'd steal away! 
Come, come, Stc. 
THE RING MY MOTHER WORE. 
By Louts DELA. 
The earth has many treasures rare, 
In gems and golden ore; 
My heart bath one mere precious far— 
The ring my mother wore, 
I 
saw it first, when I, a 
child, 
Was playing by her side ; 
She told me then, ' twas father's gift, 
When she became his bride. 
I 
saw it oft in sorrow's hours, 
Which marked the after years, 
-When shining on the soft, white hand, 
That wiped away my tears, 
And oh I 
I 
saw it once again, 
When, on her dying bed, 
She lifted up her hand in prayer 
And laid it on my head. 
Beside that bed, where fell my tears, 
The ring to me was given; 
She placed it on my hand, and said: 
" 
We'll meet again in heaven I" 
I 
kissed the cheek I 
oft had pressed. 
From which the rose had fled ; 
And bowed with grief, stood motherless, 
Alone, beside the dead. 
Among the blest in realms above, 
Where sorrows are unknown, 
Oh ! may I 
meet my mother dear, 
No more to weep alone. 
Her dying words of love and faith, 
I'll cherish evermore, 
Within the heart which holds so dear, 
The ring my mother wore.

THE GLORIOUS VINTAGE OF CHAMPAGNE. 
W ords by EDMUND FALCONER. 
Music by M. W. 
BALM 
When fortune frowns and friends forsake, 
And faith in love is dead; 
When man has nothing left to stake, 
To hope, nor yet to dread, 
One god-like pleasure doth remain, 
Worth all the j )ys he's lost— 
The glorious vintage of champagne, 
To drink at some knave's cost. 
CHORUS. 
Let life's last song have for refrain, 
The glorious vintage of champagne. 
When one by one fade all the beams, 
That light morning's path, 
So dull the world around us seems, 
At life itself we're wrath. 
New vigeur then would we regain, 
Let's drink at some knave's cost; 
The glorious vintage of champagne, 
Worth all the joys we've lost. 
Let life's last song, &c. 
BEAUTIFUL VENICE. 
Beautiful Venice! City of song! 
What inem'ries of old to thy regiols belong! 
What sweet recollections still cling to my heart. 
As thy fast- fading shores from my vision depart ! 
Oh ! poesy's home is thy light colonades, 
Where the wind gently sigh as the sweet twilight fades! 
CHORUS. 
I 
have known many homes, but the dwelling for me, 
Is beautiful Venice, the bride of the sea! 
Beautiful Venice ! queen of the earth ! 
Where dark eyes shine brightly ' mid music and mirth, 
Where gay serenaders, by light of the star, 
Oft. mingle their son°. with the dulcet guitar : 
All that's lovely in life, all that's deathless in song, 
Fair Italy's Isle! to thy regions belong ! 
I 
have known many homes, &c. 
WHEN THE SWALLOWS HOMEWARD,. 
FLY. 
When the swallows homeward fly, 
When the roses scattered lie. 
When, from neither hill nor dale, 
Chanute the silvery nightingale. 
CITORITS. 
In these words my bleeding heart 
W ould to thee its grief impart: 
Shall we ever meet again ? 
Parting au ! parting, parting is pain, 
Parting, ah parting, parting is pain 1 
When the white swan southward roves, 
There to seek the orange-.4roves, 
When the red tints of the West, 
Prove the sun has gone to rest. 
In these words my bleeding heart 
Would to thee its grief impart: 
Shall we ever meet again ? 
Parting, ah! parting, parting is pain, 
Parting, au ; parting, parting is pain I 
0 poor heart! whate'er befall, 
There is ' e.t for thee and all— 
That on earth which fades away,

Comes again in bright array :

I'VE NO SISTER NOW. 
By 
THEODORE Romaiss. 
Am—' I 
have no mother now, I'm weeping.' 
Hark, the soft wind s 
sighing, 
Through every bush and tree, 
Where now sweet sister's lying, 
Away from love and me. 
From eyes the tears ac starting, 
And sorrow smiths my brow, 
Oh, weary was our parting, 
I 
have no sister now. 
I 
see the stars are shining, 
Ott shit • r's white tombstone, 
The rose bush around it twining. 
Is here, like me, alone. 
And just, like me, are weeping, 
Those dewdrops from the bough 
Long time has she been sleeping, 
I 
have no sister now. 
My heart is ever lonely, 
My We is dreary and sad. 
Twas her sweet presence only, 
That made my 
si irit glad, 
From morning until even, 
Care rests upon my brow, 
She's gone from me to heaven, 
I 
have no sister now.

HE JOLLY CATS. 
'Words by G. W. Hum% 
Ant— Jolly Dogs. 
There are a 
lot of jolly cats, 
That often meet at night, 
To hold a 
comcert on the tiles, 
Or else to squall and fight. 
CHORUS. 
And they always are so noisy, oh, 
So noisy oh, so noisy oh, 
They always are so noisy, oh, 
Whilst on the tiles they be. 
They fi(rlit, they bite, 
They swear and tear each other's hair, 
They call, they squall, 
Such noky cats are they.

Mel row, row, mol row, row, and

There they are again, there they are again, 
Kwatchk! pitutt! there they are again. 
Such jody cats are they. 
They kick up such a 
jolly row, 
In vain to sleep I 
tries, 
'Their little claws Put sure were made 
To scratch each other's eyes, 
For they always, &c. 
They wander round the chimney pots, 
And climb the water spout, 
And oft I 
have to throw a 
brick, 
To put them to the rout. 
And they always, eic. 
To watch their gambols and their pranks 
Sometimes is jolly fun, 
Although I 
never shot the cat, 
I 
mean to buy a 
gun.. 
For they always, &c. 
whey drink our milk and steal our meat, 
And think it not a

And when they bring forth kittens, 
They come fifty at a

JOCKEY HAT AND FEATHRIL 
As I 
was walking out one day, 
Thinking of the weather, 
I 
saw a 
pair of roguish eyes, 
'Neath a 
hat and feather; 
She looked at me, I 
looked at her 
It made my heart pit-pat, 
Then turning round she said to 
" 
How do you like my hat ?" 
CHORUS. 
nae, 
Oh I 
I 
said its gay and pretty, to, 
They look well together, 
Those glossy curls and jockey hat.„ 
With a 
rooster's feather. 
She wore a 
handsome broadcloth ba&quel, 
Out the latest fashion, 
And flounces all around her dress. 
Made her look quite dashing; 
Her high-heeled boots as she walked on 
The pavement went pit-pet, 
ne'er forget the smile I 
saw, 
Beneath that jockey hat. 
Oh! I 
said its gay, &r.. 
She kissed her band and said " Au revoir," 
Then I 
was a 
goner, 
Before I'd time to say " Good-bye," 
She was round the corner. 
I 
tried that night, but could not sleep, 
So up in bed I 
sat, 
And right before my face I 
thought 
I 
saw that jockey bat. 
Oh I 
I 
said. its way, 8ro.

WE PARTED BY THE RIVER-SIDE. 
We parted by the river-side; 
The moon looked down on you and me, 
The stars put on a 
look of pride, 
The river murmured to the sea: 
The dew-drops kissed the blushing rose, 
The gentle winds did sigh; 
One word broke nature's sweet repose, 
The sad word was 
Good-bye! 
CHORUS. 
Oh tell me that you love- me yet, 
For, oh! the parting gives me pain. 
Say, tell me that you'll not forget, 
For, we may never meet again! 
We parted by the river-side: 
A tear-drop trembled on your cheek, 
In vain to tell my love I 
tried, 
My heart was sad, I 
could not speak. 
I 
promised that I 
would be true 
Vo long as I 
would live; 
The parting kiss I 
gave to you, 
Was all I 
had to give. 
Oh! tell me- Ire. 
We 
parted by the river-side: 
And I 
have roamed a 
distant clime, 
My i_eart has not forgot its pride; 
For, I 
have loved you all the time. 
And I 
am faithful to you still, 
While I 
believe you true; 
Afar or near, let come what will, 
lin love you, you, only you. 
Olt 1 
tell me, Oka,

I 
WILL STAND BY MY FRIEND. 
As we go on through life's career, 
how many have to rough it ? 
While one gives us a 
helping hand, 
A dozen try to buffet. 
Still let's be faithful where we can, 
A helping hancl to lend; 
My maxim is, that, come what may, 
I 
will stand by my friend ! 
My maxim is, &e. 
When well to do in life, 
We all a 
ready welcome get; 
It's ‘ I 
low do you do, to-day, my boy ? 
I'm 2lad that we have met." 
But, if in our career through life, 
Bad luck does us attend, 
How few will give a 
hand and say, 
I 
will stand by my friend ! 
How few will, 
A friend in need is one indeed ; 
His heart and hand he lends; 
How different where we have to say, 
Oh ! save us from our friends! 
'With many friendship's but a 
name, 
No sympathy they lend, 
They bid good-day, but never say, 
I 
will stand by my friend! 
They bid, &c-.. 
DIY SISTER DEAR. 
From the Opera of ' M ASSANIELLO.' 
My sister, dear, o'er this rude cheek, 
How oft I've felt the tear-drop stealing, 
When those mute looks have told the feeling 
Heaven denied thy tongue to speak, 
And thou hadst comfort in tint tear 
Shed for thee, my sister, dear. 
But now, alas! I 
weep alone, 
By thee—by joy, by hope forsaken, 
MA thoughts that darkest fears awaken 
Trembling. f,r 
thy fate unknown, 
And vainly flows the bitter tear, 
Shed for thee, my sister, dear,

Words- by GEORGE COOPER. 
Music by H ARRISON M ILLIS/17i, 
There are lonely hearts to cherish 
While the days are going by; 
There are weary souls who perish, 
While the days are going by; 
if a 
smile we can renew, 
As our journey we pursue, 
0 the good we all may do 
While the days are going by, 
CHORUS. 
While the days are going by, 
While the days are going by; 
All may find a 
field of toil, 
While the days are going by, 
There's no time for idle scorning, 
While the days are going by; 
Let your face be like the morning, 
While the days are going by; 
0! the world is full of sighs, 
Full of sad and weeping sighs; 
Help your fallen brother rise, 
While the days are going by. 
While the days are going by, &e. 
All the lovino. links that bind us, 
While the days are going by, 
One by one we leave behind us, 
While Cie days are going by; 
But the seeds of good we sow, 
Both in shade and shine will grow, 
And will keep our hearts aglow, 
While the days are going by. 
While the days are going by, & c. 
THE Mt/SIC MASTER. 
'She was called a 
coquette at the ball in the west, 
But what did she care for that ? 
The man wasn't there that she loved best, 
So she didn't mind what she was at. 
She thought, though I 
flirt here as much as I 
can, 
And go on in a 
terrible manner, 
My heart is at home with that dashing young man. 
Who teaches me to play the piano. 
CHORUS. 
With his two-four, three-four, six-eight time, 
And play the passage faster; 
F, A, C, E, G, B, D, 
She loved her music master. 
She feared her papit'd be a 
bar to her hopes, 
For he wanted her tied to a 
lord ; 
And she eloped down a 
ladder of ropes, 
Her musician supplying the chord ; 
For she was too sharp to be wed to a 
flat, 
And escaped in a 
natural manner; 
And it isn't a 
slur on her levier that 
He's a 
teacher upon the piano. 
With his two-four, &c. 
And now they are married, he's not too much cash, 
But she don't note that minor offence, 
For he'll get her fortune and then cut a 
dash, 
At her father, the major's, expense. 
.13ut one thing he wanted that wasn't quite fair, 
And yet from his wish he may waver ; 
The : when she refused him a 
key he did swear, 
And muttered a 
demme-stuni-quaver. 
With his two-four, &c. 
She has bought him a Broadwood's mahogany grand, 
On which when at lo me, he will play, 
For since he's possessed of an heiress's hand, 
He'll teach no more from to- day. 
And doctor of music he shortly may be, 
Because though in vain he might try it, 
To get honor by talent, between you and me, 
As he's money, he's only to buy it. 
With his two-four, &c.

The next is Charles James Fox, who blew up parliament one day-
Guy's hospital was built upon the ruins, people say ; 
Next Joan of Noah's Ark, an English maiden in her prime, 
It's from a 
photograph by Mayall, taken at the time ; 
The other's Mary, Queen of Scots, or else it is John Bright, 
We're not sure which, our figures somehow got mixed up, one night; 
The next's a 
famous pugilist, his name I 
think's John Knox, 
Then Shakspeare, author of the tragedy of Box and Cox. 
Spoken- Step up, they're all alive I 
alive !-Cnonus, as before. 
The merry monarch, Charles the First, you'll notice, dressed in red, 
Folks made fun of him all his life, and then took off his head. 
The kind, good Duke of Gloster, who became old Dick the three, 
lie killed two princes, but he loved his mother, don't you see ; 
Wat Tyler. that's the man who first invented " who's your hatter." 
King John the Chartist, who once signed a 
something, but no matter; 
Next, King Canute and Anne of Cleves, preparing to elope. 
And 1Vashington, who first invented washing-days and soap.-Cno.

Our room of horrors if you'd see, please twopence extra pay, 
But if your nerves ain't very strong you'd better keep away; 
First, that repulsive little boy is Mager Johnny Green-
lie put the kitten in the well, and stole a 
crinoline ; 
His mother thrashed him for the deed, and after her attacks 
We managed to secure a 
neat impression in the whacks. 
That hideous monster, next to him, was taken during life, 
lie asked a 
friend to dine-without permission of his wife.-CnO. 
The next is Mr. Peabody, most terrible of men, 
Then cruel Guillotine, who first invented Gillott's pen ; 
Our room of horrors would not be at all complete, you'll say, 
Without the author of the last absurd sensation play ; 
This strange, infernal-like machine (brings out two or three guns, fast-
ened together,) oft frightens folks to fits, 
And when it goes off, blows you into twenty million bits: [(70 qr.) 
You'd like to see it work, perhaps-you wouldn't ? well, then, go Nuns 
And send your friends to patronize the famous wax- work show.-Cno.

THE GRAVE OF BONAPARTE. 
On a 
lone barren isle, where the wild roaring billows, 
Assail the stern rock, and the loud tempests rave, 
The hero lies still, while the dew- drooping willows, 
Like fond weeping mourners lean over the grave. 
The lightnings may flash and the loud thunders rattle, 
lie heeds not, he hears not, he's free from all pain; 
He sleeps his last sleep, he. has fought his last battle, 
No sound can awake him to glory again— 
No sound can awake him to glory again. 
Yet, spirit immortal, the tomb cannot bind thee, 
For like thine own eagle that soared to the sun, 
Thou springest from bondage, and leav'st behind thee 
A name, which before thee no mortal had won. 
Through nations may combat, and war's thunders rattle, 
No more on thy steed wilt thou sweep o'er the plain ; 
Thou Lleep'st thy last sleep, thou ! last fought thy last battle, 
No sound can awake thee to glory again— 
No sound can awake thee to glory again 
Oh, shade of the mighty, where now are the legions, 
That rushed but to conquer when thou led'st them on t 
Alas ! they have perished in far chilly regions, 
And all save the fame of their triumph is gone. 
The trumpet may sound, and the loud cannon rattle, 
They heed not, they hear not, they're free from all pain; 
They sleep their last sleep, they have fought their last battle, 
No sound can awake them to glory again— 
No sound can awake them to glory again.

THE DYING CALIFORNIAN. 
Hearken to me, brother, hearken! I've something I 
would say, 
Ere the veil my vision darkens, and I 
go from earth away. 
I 
am dying, brother, dying; soon you'll miss are from your berth, 
And my form will soon be lying ' neath the ocean's briny surf. 
Lay up nearer, brother, nearer, for my limbs are getting cold, 
And thy presence seetneth dearer when thine arms around me fold. 
I 
am going, brother, going, yet may hope in God is strong; 
I 
am willing, brother, knowing that he doeth nothing wrong. 
Tell my father, when you greet him, that in death I 
prayed for 
him; 
Prayed that I 
might, one day, meet him in a 
world that's free from 
Tell my mother, God will help her now that she is growing old; 
Say her child did yearn to kiss her when his lips grew pale and 
cold. 
Listen, brother; catch each whisper; 'tis my wife I'd speak of now; 
Tell, oh ! tell her how I 
missed her, when the fever burned my 
brow. 
Tell her—
rob
v. 
rother, closely listen; don't forget a 
single word ; 
That, in death my eyes did glisten with the tears her memory 
stirred. 
Tell her, she must kiss my children, like the kiss I 
last impressed; 
hold them as when last I 
held them, folded closely to my breast; 
Give them early to their Maker, putting all their trust in God, 
And he never will forsake her, for lie says so in His Word. 
Oh ! my children—Heaven bless them! they were all my life to 
me! 
Would I 
could once more caress them, ere I 
sink into the sea. 
'Twas for them I 
crossed the ocean, what my hopes were, I'll not 
For tell;
they've gained an orphan's portion, yet lie doeth all things 
well. 
Tell my sisters I 
remember every kindly parting word; 
And my heart has been kept tender by the thoughts their memory 
stirred. 
Tell them I 
never reached the haven where I 
sought the precious 
dust ; 
But I've gained a 
port called heaven, where the gold will never 
rust. 
Tell them to secure an entrance, for they will find their brother 
there; 
Faith in Jesus and repentance will secure for each a 
share. 
Hark ! I 
hear my Jesus speaking; 'tis His voice I 
know so well. 
When I'm gone, oh! don t 
be weeping; brother, here's my last 
farewell !

LARBOARD WATCH. 
DUETT. 
At dreary midnight's cheerless hour, 
Deserted e'en by Cynthia's beams, 
When tempests beat acid torrents pour, 
And twinkling stars no lagergleam, 
The wearied sailor spent with toil, 
Clings firmly to the weather shrouds, 
And still the lengthened hour to wile, 
Sings as he views the gathering clouds, 
Larboard Watch, a-hey 
a 
ton us. 
But who can speak the joy he feels, 
While o'er the foam his vessel reels, 
And his tied eye-lids shun hering fall, 
lie rouses at the welcome call, 
Of Larboard watch, a-hey 
With anxious care he eyes each wave, 
That, swelling, threatens to o'erwhehn, 
And his storm-heaten bark to save, 
Directs with skill the faithful helm. 
With joy lie drinks the cheering grog, 
Mid storms that bellow loud and hoarse,. 
With joy be heaves the reeling log, 
And marks the leeway and the course. 
Larboard watch, a-boy! 
But who can speak, .± e.

Row gently here, my Gondolier; 
So softly wake the tide, 
That not an ear on earth may hear,

As starry eyes to see: 
Oh think what tales " twould have to tell 
Of wand'ring youths like me. 
Row gently, dze. 
Now rest thee here, my Gondolier; 
Hush hush, for up I 
go— 
To climb you light belongs to night, 
Whilst thou keepest watch below. 
Ah ! did we take for heaven above, 
But half such pains as we, 
Take day and night for woman's love, 
What angels we should be.

Good news from home—good news for me, 
Has come across the deep blue sea, 
From friends that I 
have left in tears— 
From friends that I've not seen for years. 
And since we parted long ago, 
My life has been a 
scene of woe, 
But now a 
joyful hour has conic, 
For I 
have heard good news from home. 
CHORUS. 
Good news from home, good news for me, 
Has come across the deep blue sea, 
From friends that I 
have left in tears, 
From friends that I've not seen for years. 
No father's near to guide me now, 
No mother's tear to soothe ray brow, 
No sister's voice falls on my ear, 
Nor brother's smile to give me cheer. 
But, though I 
wander far away, 
My heart is full of joy to- day, 
For friends across the ocean's foam 
Have sent to me, good news from home. 
Good news from home, (tc. 
When shall I 
see that cottage door, 
Where I've spent years of joy before? 
'Twas there I 
knew no grief or care, 
My heart was always happy there. 
Though I

Nor stand upon my native shore, 
Where'er on earth I'm doomed to roam, 
My heart will be with those at home.

THOU HAST WOUNDED THE SPIRIT 
THAT LOVED THEE. 
Thou hast wounded the spirit that loved thee, 
And cherished thine image for years, 
Thou hast taught me at last to forget thee, 
In secret, in silence, and tears. 
As the young bird when left by its mother, 
Its earliest pinions to try, 
Round the nest will still lingering hover, 
Ere its trembling wings can fly. 
Thus we're taught in this cold world to smother, 
Each feeling that once was so dear; 
Like that young bird I'll seek to discover 
A home of affection elsewhere. 
Tho' this heart may still cling to thee fondly, 
And dream of sweet memories past, 
Yet hope, like thii rainbow of summer, 
Gives a 
prk.,nike of Lethe at last.

Near the banks of that lone river, 
Where the water lillies grow,

Nor how pure and gentle- hearted,

Near the banks of that lone river,

Bloomed and faded long ago. 
Like the stream with lillies laden, 
Will life's future current flow, 
Till in heaven I

BEAUTIFUL LEAVES. 
Beautiful leaves in their midsummer splendor, 
Clothing the forest in emerald green— 
Where are the blooms that such beauty can render, 
Or spread such a 
fullness or grace o'er the 'Scene? 
Every gay tint of the sweet garden flowers, 
Every bright garland that innocence weaves ; 
Though culled from the fairest of nature's gay bowers, 
Looks cold, if not blended with beautiful leaves. 
Beautiful leaves in the Winter time falling. 
Oft have I 
thought, as they dropped one by one, 
That they were obeying some mystical calling. 
That lured them away when the Summer was gone. 
And knowing the Spring will their brightness restore us, 
I 
have thought as time cold earth their ashes receives, 
That we too must fade, like the dead leaves before us, 
And bloom once again, like those beautiful leaves. 
THE MAN WHO CAN'T KEEP STILL. 
Since the days when I 
was a 
little child, 
I've heard my mother say, 
There was nothing ever would keep me still, 
By night or yet by day. 
Fin a 
man grown up, but it's all the same, 
For, do whatever I 
will. 
'Tis a 
fact that, whether I 
sit or stand, 
I 
really can't keep still.

When at school, they sat me on a 
chair; 
My feet went tap, tap, tap:

'Till oft I

If I 
went to church it was all the same,

To dance a

OUR GRAND-FATHRRS7 DAYS, 
A 
song for to plea.se all my kind friends before me: 
I've been thinking., of late, it new suhject to raise, 
And one I've got and I 
know it will please you: 
I 
am going to sing of our grand-fathers' days. 
In our grand fathers' days, men were judged but by merit, 
And those who were sound, got their measure of 
riie; 
But, now- a 
days, folks judge of men by their money— 
That wasn't the case in our grand- fathers' days. 
In our grand- fathers days they had no patent leathers, 
Garot-choking collars, or no peg tops pant ,
: ; 
Young men didn't go it with two- forty horses, 
Or visit young ladies, at night at their aunt's, 
The hors didn't then congregate on the corners 
To see the gals crossing, on wet slushy days, 
Nor the gals didn't want a 
policeman to help them— 
That wasn't the style in our grand- fathers' days. 
In our grand-fathers' days, billiard markers ne'er sported 
Mrstache on their lips, or goatees on their chins, 
Nor did six penny barbers drive out in light wagons, 
Nor did fish- ball waiters wear diamond pins. 
The gals didn't paint, stuff themselves up with cotton, 
They didn't wear hoops, patent bustles or stays, 
Didn't smoke cigarettes, or drink cock- tads at Taylor's: 
That wasn't the style in our grand-fathers' days. 
In our grand fathers' days married men they were steady; 
You'd not find them out every day of their lives, 
Nor see them out, late, walking home with their consinF.; 
They always retired in good time to their wives; 
They had no Champagne-suppers, no little flirtations, 
No trying logo it in various ways; 
Didn't stop in saloons with a 
female acquaintat”.e— 
They had no waiter girls in our grand fathers' days. 
In our grand fathers' days, when a 
man ran for office, 
lie did it alone for the national good, 
And not for the dollars and cents he might poeket— 
That 
something- that, now- a- days, ain't understood. 
TIml;overnment, limn, was for wisdom selected , 
Rebellion hadn't set the Country a- blaze; 
But the people have sworn that our Flag shall float over 
The Union that was in our grand-fathers' days I

Price six cents.] 
I'll sing of pretty little Flora, the gem behind the bar, 
At a 
place near Harlem, you will find my guiding star, 
She is the sweetest treasure, all around near and far, 
And to speak the truth, I 
adore her ! 
Swells flock like little flies around a 
treacle pot, 
And want to steal my fair one, but I 
don't care a 
jot, 
They talk and drink, just to look large, and fancy they'r A 1, 
But they have not half a 
chance with little Flora. 
CHORUS. 
List'ning to the music up in Central Park, 
All among the crowd I met her; 
Flora was her name, my heart is in a 
flame, 
And I 
never, never, never can forget her I ! 
How I 
love little Flora, and for hours I 
would stand, 
The proudest of the proud, and the grandest of the grand, 
And soon 
place the gold ring upon her tiny hand, 
Yet I 
keep my eye on all who stand before her; 
When swells they pass a 
joke, she says, ' Sir, don't be rude,' 
And putting on a 
frown, declares they very much intrude, 
Then, turning round, she looks at me, as much as just to say, 
Oh 1 
George, you have the heart of little Flora! 
List'ning to the music, &c. 
I 
could eat pretty Flora my love is so sincere, 
She wants no Bloom of Youth, her skin it is so fair, 
Her eyes are full of fire, she's a 
splendid head of hair, 
And in a 
brooch she carries me before her; 
We've named the happy day, so I'm rigilt for life, 
lf all is true as she says, she'll prove a 
charming wife, 
So am I 
not a 
lucky man, my rivals to defeat, 
And marry my own charming little Flora ? 
List'ning to the music, Szo. 
JESSIE, THE tELLE AT THE BAR. 
'Twas at a 
rail- road station, in pursuit of my vocatic n, 
I 
saw a 
tall and handsome girl, wiro etood behind the bar. 
1 
heard some one call her Jessie, perhaps, 'twas Mr. Pond, the lessee, 
And her diamond eyes were twinkling, just like the evening star. 
I 
found this pretty dame made love to all that came, 
In a 
quiet sort of way, with her eyes so soft and bright. 
She had lovers half a 
score, always some one to adore, 
From the first train in the morning, till the last train out at night. 
SPOKEN.—Yes, nor admirers were, 
cnoacs. 
A 
tinker and a 
tailor, and a 
soldier and a 
sailor, 
And a 
swell who used to talk about his pa and his ma, 
A butcher and a 
baker, and a 
quiet looking quaker, 
All courted pretty Jessie at the rail-road bar, 
N OW 
this darling little creature, with a 
smile on every feature, 
Was serving all the custormrs with cakes and bitter beer, 
And this was on a 
Monday; so, I 
asked her il on Sunday 
She would meet me at the Park gate, when she gave me such a 
leer, 
And then she said to me, 11 most happy I 
should be, 
But I'm sorry to inform you that it's not my Sunday out; 
One Sunday out of nine is the only day that's mine ;" 
And then she had to leave me just to serve a 
glass of stout. 
SPOREN.—Yes, but she never informed me that she had on previous 
Sundays walked out with— 
A tinker, etc. 
Well, better late than never, and I 
thought that I 
was clever, 
To get Jessie dear to meet me, when it was her Starr ay out, 
With my hair curled and anointed, at the time and place appointed, 
I 
was there to the minute, and began to look about— 
And when my Jessie came, my heart was in a 
flame, 
When I 
saw her water- fall and her bonnet trimmed so gay. 
She politely took my arm, I 
admired her every charm— 
But judge of my surprise, when I 
heard some nrchins say. 
SPOKEN.—I 
say, Bill, if there ain't Jessie, along with another swell! 
why, I've seen her with— 
A 
tinker, etc. 
Now my confidence was shaken, but I 
thought the boys mkstaken, 
And my modesty would not permit to ask if it was true. 
I 
proposed, and she accepted, in a 
manner unaffected, 
And the tears she shed completely hid from me her eyes no blue. 
Then I 
sent her a 
wedding dress, fit for an Empress. 
And saw the porter trive it her, while serving at the bar, 
Bat on our wedding•day, Miss Jessie ran away 
And got married to a 
man who sold the HERALD and the STAII 
SPOKEN.—Yes, and the only consolation I 
had Was, she had taken ink 
besides myself, 
A tinker, etc.

My little blue butterfly, rest awhile, 
here whore the garden blooms ! 
The beautiful roses, how sweet they smile, 
With rich and rare perfumes! 
Come, rest you here in clover, 
Why must you onward hie? 
Each bud you kiss, you rover, 
And then away you fly I

Ah I—its just the same with love; yes, 
Well find it out at last!

From heart to heart he'll flee, 
A 
little butterfly so gay, 
That's roving from you to me! 
So, little blue butterfly, gay and free, 
Never a 
word you say; 
But wooing and winning you sail in glee, 
Through all the summer day! 
The rose and pink are smiling, 
Come, linger by their side; 
The lillies fair beguiling, 
Their lips won't be denied I 
Ah !—it's just the same, ttc.

Blue-eyed violets are nodding 
On the mild and balmy breeze, 
While the rippling brook is singing 
All its sweetest melodies: 
She was fairer than the flowers

Blooming on the green bill- side, 
Where the violets are nodding 
Oe'r the darling one that died.

Oh, her voice was like sweet mnsic, 
Gushing forth in songs so light, 
That our hearts were tilled with sorrow 
When we saw death's chilling blight; 
But we hope to nit- et our darling 
Far beyond death's changeful shore, 
Where no angel's flowers are blooming, 
Save to bloom for OVCITIlore.

KATIE'S SECRET. 
The sunlight is beautiful, Mother, 
And sweetly the flowers bloom to-day, 
And birds in the branches of hawthorn, 
Are caroling ever so gay: 
And down by the rock in the meadow, 
The rill ripples by with a 
song ; 
And, Mother, I, too, have been singing, 
The merriest all the day long. 
Last night I 
was weeping, dear Mother, 
Last night I 
was weeping alone: 
The world was so dark and so dreary, 
My heart it grew heavy as stone; 
I 
thought of the lonely and loveless, 
All lonely and loveless was I. 
I 
scarcely could tell why it was, Mother, 
But, oh! I 
was wishing to die. 
Last night I 
was weeping, dear Mother, 
But Willie came down by the gate, 
And whispered: Come out in the moonlight, 
I've something to say to you, Kate. 
Oh ! Mother, to him I 
am dearer 
Than all in the wide world beside; 
He told me so out in the moonlight, 
And called me his darling, his bride. 
So now I 
will gather my roses, 
And twine in my long braided hair: 
Then Willie will come in the evening, 
And smile when he sees me so fair— 
And out in the moonlieht we'll wander, 
Way down by the old hawthorn-tree. 
Oh Mother I 
wonder if any 
Were ever so happy as we. 
THOU EAST LEARNED TO LOVE ANOTHER. 
Thon bast learned to love another— 
Thou bast broken every vow— 
We have parted from each other, 
And my heart is lonely now. 
I 
have taught my looks to shun thee, 
When coldly we have met, 
For another's smile bath won thee, 
And thy voice I 
must forget, 
Oh I 
is it well to sever 
This heart from thine for ever, 
Can I 
forget thee ? never! 
Farewell, farewell for ever. 
We have met in scenes of pleasure, 
We have met in halls of pride, 
I 
have seen thy new found treasure, 
And I've gazed upon thy bride. 
Thy looks were stern and altered— 
Thy words ran cold and high, 
How my traitor courage faltered, 
When I 
dared to meet thine eye. 
Would I 
ne'er had met thee, 
Fain, fain, would I 
forget thee, 
'Twere folly to regret thee; 
Farewell, farewell for ever. 
We have met and and we have parted, 
Yet I 
uttered scarce a 
word, 
Like a 
guilty thing I 
started, 
When thy well known voice I 
heard. 
I 
have marked the timid lustre, 
Of thy downcast nappy eye, 
I 
have seen thee gaze upon her, 
Forgettinf!. I 
was nigh. 
Oh, woman's love may grieve her, 
And woman's pride will leave her, 
Life is fled when love deceives her, 
Farewell, farewell for ever. 
HAPPY BE THY DREAMS. 
61. 
Oh, happy, happy, happy be thy dreams, 
Bright be the vision that before thee lies, 
Dreams of radiant hills and sunlit streams, 
Dreams of the bright and blue unclouded skies! 
Sleep—for thy mother watches by thy side; 
O'er thee, unseen, the watchful spirits glide. 
Pure as the star that o'er thee mildly beams, 
Oh, happy, happy, happy be thy dreams, 
Happy, happy, happy be thy dreams. 
Oh, happy, happy be thy path in life, 
Long still thy mother's tender love to share; 
Till Heaven has called her from this vale of strife, 
And purer bliss succeed to worldly care! 
Then, if the Angels earth-ward turn their eyes, 
She will watch o'er thee from the radiant skies. 
Sleep—while yon Star still o'er thee mildly beams, 
Oh, happy, happy, happy be thy dreams, 
Happy, happy, happy be thy dreams!
