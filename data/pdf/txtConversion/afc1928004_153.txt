I'M THE HAPPIEST SOUL THAT'S OUT . 
Ant.—" 
The Happiest Fellow Out." 
Sung by MISS JENNIE ENGEL, 
How very pleasant 'tis to feel in this world of strife, 
That always happy I 
can be, each day of my life ; 
No troubles to molest me, or put me about, 
A 
mind contented I 
possess, I'm the happiest soul that's out. 
CHORUS. 
With me fal the ral, the ral he lal, &c. 
Happy as the lark, each morning I 
arise, 
With a 
smile of gladness beaming in my eyes, 
Free as mountain air, all sunshine round about, 
Happy as a 
queen I 
am, the happiest soul that's out. 
With me fal the ral, the ral le lal, 
Some complain without a 
cause, but I 
never grieve. 
Though lovers many I 
I 
ave had, who did deceive, 
But what of that I 
only say, more there are about, 
Disappointment do not feel but am the happiest soul that's out. 
With me fal the ral, the ral he lal, & c. 
Everywhere all observe, I'm such a 
merry elf, 
Every one I 
strive to make as happy as myself; 
Very often I 
succeed, there's not the slightest doubt, 
Considered am by every one, the happiest soul that's out. 
With me fal the ral, the ral le lal, & e. 
By striving to amuse, affording all delight, 
Your applause confirms the fact, bestowed night after night : 
Every night as I 
appear, all around me shout, 
There's the merry creature, the happiest soul that's out. 
With me fal the ral, the ral le lal, 
Ee'r I 
do conclude, as advice to you would say, 
Come here every night I v 1 , btue devils chase away; 
My maxim is contentment, and I 
have found (. ut, 
That I 
am, as you preeeive, the happiest son1 that's out. 
With me fal the ml, the ral le lal, dze.

Spoken.—One with golden looks, by Jove, and without one of those 
useful articles (holding up umbrella), when she popp'd her little arm in 
mine my heart beat to that degree it nearly dislocated my ribs (of the um-
brella, I 
mean ) ; it's a

The rain poured down alarmingly, 
When to a 
tree we came, 
And shelter took beneath it, 
There I 
quickly learned her name. 
She also told me where she lived, 
With pa down at the farm; 
A 
farmer's daughter! well, said I, 
That is an extra charm. 
Spoken.—I 
glory in country life, and a 
farmer's daughter, what could be 
better; I 
wish'd the rain would keep on as I 
rather liked— 
Courting in the rain, eze. 
At length the rain abated, 
And the sun shone out quite bright, 
And the little birds began to sing, 
My heart it felt so light. 
I 
gently press'd her arm in mine, 
And said now don't say " nay," 
But let me come and meet you here 
Again some other day. 
Spoken.—Well, she said, I 
can't exactly decide, you must ask my pa. So 
I 
made up my mind to go, and inform the old gentleman we'd been—

We reach'd the old farm-house, and then 
She introduced to me 
Her pa, a 
jolly nice old boy, 
With him I 
made quite free. 
I 
told him when and where I'd met 
His daughter in the rain, 
And bless'd the lucky chance that took 
Me down that country lane. 
Spoken.—The old gentleman was quite delighted with my kind atten-
tion, and I 
soon gain'd his consent, which proves the truth of the old 
proverb," It never rains but it pours ;" and so it occurred to me, through—

Won't you tell me, Mollie darling, 
That you love none else but me, 
For I 
love you. Mollie darling, 
You are all the world to me. 
0! tell me, darling, that you love me, 
Put your little hand in mine, 
Take my heart, sweet Mollie darling, 
Say that you will give me thine. 
Mollie, fairest, sweetest, dearest, 
Look up. darling, tell me this; 
Do you love me, Mollie darling, 
Let your answer be a 
kiss. 
Stars are smiling, Mollie darling, 
Thro' the mystic veil of night; 
They seem laughing, Mollie darling, 
While fair Ltina hides her light. 
0 no one listens but the flowers, 
While they hang their heads in shame, 
They are modest, Mollie darling,

THERE ARE FRIENDS THAT WE NEVER 
FORGET. 
Words be ALICE HAWTHORNE. 
Music by SEP. W III3fElt. 
There are friends that we never forget. 
There are hearts that we ever hold dear. 
Tho' we meet with a 
kiss in a 
moment of bliss, 
Yet we part with a 
sigh and a 
tear ; 
Oh we learn our first lesson of love, 
At the home where our childhood is pased, 
And we never forget tho' we part with regret, 
The friends of our youth till the last. 
There are friends that we never forget, 
There are hearts that we ever hold dear, 
Tho' we meet with a 
kiss, in a 
moment of bliss, 
Yet we part with a 
sigh and a 
tear. 
There are friends that we never forget, 
Tho' the sea may divide us for years, 
Yet we linger apart with a 
sorrowing heart, 
In an absence that only endears; 
There are friends that we never forget, 
There are hearts that we ever hold dear, 
Tho' we find but a 
few, who are earnest and true, 
Yet how sweet is our passing career. 
There are friends, &e.

LOOK AT THE CLOCK 
AIR.—" Groves of Blarney." 
Young ladies tarry, think ere you marry, 
A 
lesson pray take from what I 
sing, 
For though black slaves are, of course unknown here, 
We wives, you'll find are the slaves of the ring. 
Our husbands nightly very unpolitely, 
With their companionc abroad will roam, 
Of us ne'er thinking, they go off drinking, 
While we are crying our eyes out at home. 
CHORUS. 
Think, think, how slowly the moments pass, 
While you're enjoying your pipe and glass, 
Think, think, how slowly the moments pass, 
•Now, gentlemen, pray mind what I 
say and look, look at 
the clock. 
Now, thus to leave us and so deceive us, 
I'm sure you'll own a 
monstrous sin, 
For there's no knowing where you are going, 
Or what bad company you may get in, 
For when you tell us, deceitful fellows, 
That at your club you have passed the night, 
At that saloon oh, you are often seen oh, 
You must acknowledge that is not right. 
Think, think, &c. 
Then when returning, we're soon discerning 
That in your manner there's something queer, 
You whisper " salmon," but that's all gammon, 
It's something stronger than that I 
fear. 
It must be really, for when awaking, 
A 
noise you are making for a " cup of tea," 
You didn't ought to want soda water, 
Through eating salmon you must agree. 
Think, think, &c. 
The cradle rocking or mending stocking, 
The time we strive hard to pass away, 
While you are flirting, your heallh, too, hurting, 
By staying out till the break of day, 
Besides suspicions will sometimes enter our heads 
'While sitting up waiting alone, 
About your latch keys, for who's to know pray, 
Whose doors they open beside your own. 
Think think. ckc.

THE PRIDE OF PETTICOAT LANE: 
OR, 
DARLING MARY JANE. 
Sang by Miss JENNIE ENGEL. 
Of all the trials that mortals have I 
think that Love's the worst, 
In every sad disaster you're sure to find him first, 
My reason now for saying this. I 
quickly will explain, 
How I've been served by courting one the pride of Petticoat Lane. 
cnoutts. 
Then oh what would I 
give, 
Could I 
only but obtain 
A sight of my darling Mary Jane; 
The Pride of Petticoat Lane. 
I'm not going to say that she's a 
queen because I 
know she aint, 
Nor yet a 
perfect beauty, an angel, nor a 
saint, 
Her business it's not over grand you oan bear hcr might and main, 
On Sunday mornings crying out, " hot stew'd eels," down the Lane. 
Then oh what, Sce. 
Her mother used to carry out a 
baked potato can, 
IIer father was that celebrated Turkey Rhubarb man, 
Her sisters made handkerchiefs in a 
crowd, her brothers did the 811114 
So amongst them all they did a 
tidy business down the Lane. 
Then oh what, &c. 
I 
used to go on Sunday's and sit behind her stall, 
No sooner there than a 
crowd of dirty brats would loudly bawl, 
" 
Oh! here's some swell that's out of luck, we'll watch his little game,' 
Then with cabbage stumps, and orange peel, they'd pelt me down the 
Lane. 
Then oh what. & c. 
One day as I 
sat by her side, she said, " Oi Georgey dear, 
Do serve out some eels for me I 
feel so very queer; 
For I 
want to run to mother, I 
will soon return again," 
So I 
had the job to cry and sell hot stew'd eels down the Lane. 
Then oh what, & c. 
When she returned she brought with her, a 
ferociousdooking man, 
Who empties over me all the hot eels in the can; 
Which burnt my face, and sdoilt my clothes, but I 
wouldn't care a 
fig 
It burnt the hair all off my bead so I'm forced to wear a 
wig. 
Then oh what, &c.

THE SONG OF THE FRENCH FLOW ER GIRL. 
M usic by SAM. BAGNALL. 
Sung by Miss JENNIE ENGL. 
Ladies, dear ladies, and gentlemen too, 
For one single moment listen, au ! do, 
To a 
wandering florist with my little few 
Of sweet scented beauties to sell unto you. 
I 
am far, far away trom my own native France, 
Where the gayest and fairest exquisitely dance: 
With garlands of flowers of various hues, 
Will you from my basket, will you please to choose. 
CHORUS. 
Of my -violets, roses, sweet scented posies, 
All of them sparkling, dripping with dew ; 
Violets, roses, sweet scented posies, 
Who'll buy my roses all sparkling with dew. 
Deserted, oh, dear, not one single son, 
Then charming ladies I 
ask of you ; 
To look at my roses and lilies so lair, 
Like diamonds they'll sparkle and shine in your hair -
I 
have daisies, pansies, violets as well. 
The blue-bells of Scotland the Scottish blue-bells, 
The Shamrock so green, with England's sweet rose ; 
Ma'mselle, from my basket will you please to choose 
Of my violets, roses, ctc 
Do buy if you please,—it you please will you buy, 
I 
have come a 
long way my fortune to try ; 
From my dear native France, my own sunny land, 
They will make you look handsome, their will make 
you look grand : 
I 
have some for your coat, 1 
have some for your room, 
The odours are delicious and all in full blown ; 
It you don't, buy them soon they will wither awl die, 
Amid leave me to Nvander aim plaimmtively cry. 
Of my violets, roses, Sc. 
DON'T GO, MOLLIE DARLING. 
Words by FRANK D UMONT. 
Music by J. HENRY AV IIITMOP.E. 
Oh! Mollie, darling, the anchor is weighed, 
The ship is now ready to sail o'er the sea, 
Each moment is precious and time will not wait, 
Oh! Mollie my treasure do listen to me; 
You're going far away from kindred and friends, 
Oil to the land that is far o'er the foam, 
We've no one but you to gladden our hearts— 
Don't leave us, Mollie, sweet light of our home. 
CIIORUS. 
Don't cross the sea, Mollie, and leave us alone, 
For dreary our beautiful home then will be. 
We've no one to care for but you, Mollie dear, 
Don't leave us, darling. Oh ! listen to me. 
Oh ! Mollie, my darling, your father is ill, 
But still he has come down to see you depart. 
Ile stands by your side in our sorrow and pain, 
And tears tell the anguish that lies in his heart, 
Oh ! come to my arms, let me fold you again, 
Close to the heart that is throbbing for thee, 
Remember the days when I 
sang you to sleep, 
Don't leave us, Mollie, to cross the blue sea. 
Don't cross the 'sea, Mollie, & c. 
Oh! Mollie, my darling, say what will you do, 
Alone in a 
land were but strangers abide, 
No kind words you'll hear of advice, Mollie dear, 
But aim ! many evils rill lurk at your side; 
Let me kiss you, perhaps for the last time on earth, 
For we are old, and our days are but few, 
There's tears in your eyes, I 
see you'll not go--
Heav'n pour sweet blessings, dear Mollie, on you. 
Don't cross the sea, Mollie. & c.

TURKISH MANNERS DONT' SUIT ME. 
My most respectable papas— 
A grand bashaw in Turkey, 
With beard that nearly sweeps the ground, 
Complexion somewhat murkey ; 
Ills slaves oft tremble for their lives, 
When his scimetar he'll flourish, 
He's just got eight and twenty wives, 
To love, protect and nourish. 
CHORUS. 
0, my, glad am I, 
To Turkey I 
have said good-bye, 
Fin free, for you see— 
Turkish manners don't suit Inc. 
The Turks delight in many wives, 
Iii fact they lay a 
stock in ; 
You'll think their morals somewhat loose, 
To me its something shocking ; 
A Turk's but slightly married, if — 
Ilk wives but number twenty, 
l'm told that here you often rind, 
One prove more than plenty. 
0, my, glad am T, 
One day there came an ancient Turk, 
Who bored me with his bother, 
he'd got already fifty wives, 
And thought he'd like another ; 
The old gent's offer I 
declined, 
And declining's not the fashion, 
So my paternal parent flew, 
Into a 
dreadful passion. 
0, my, glad am I, ite. 
The reason I 
can speak your tongue, 
And am so good a 
talker ? 
I 
ate a 
book of words when young, 
Compiled by Mister Walker ; 
To single gents it might afford— 
Just Some slight satisfaction, 
To know I'm not engaged— and that 
; I 
could love to— distraction.

THE FACTORY GIRL OF MANCHESTER.. 
As sung by Miss JENNIE EXCEL. 
'Twas down in Lancashire in the wintry month of March, 
To commence my unhappy little story; 
I 
met a 
little lass, whom none could surpass, 
But she's left me alone in my glory. 
She wore a 
blue print gown, and a 
shawl on her arm, 
And a 
handderchief the color I've forgotten ; 
She'd a 
charming little head, the hair of which was red, 
And smothered all over with cotton. 
cnOltlfa. 
I 
brought her up to town into Westroinister, 
She was highly delighted with the dancing: 
And her pretty little clogs went tap, tap, tap, 
And I 
couldn't keep her still for her prancing. 
She said she was single, and would like to wed 
To some one who was a 
famous Comic Singer, 
Then she said to me, I'd like to marry thee, 
If thou'll place the little ring upon my finger ; 
Iran as quick as thought, and the little gem I 
bought, 
And gave it her far ever, as I 
told her ; 
But the naughty little Miss, a 
few weeks after this, 
Was married to a 
six-foot soldier. 
I 
brought her, & c. 
What these pretty girls will do to lovers kind and trae, 
How they tool them, teaze them, and despise them ; 
Until it is too late, and they have joined their fate 
By wedding those who know not how to prize them. 
So you see I've lost the girl, who I 
thought a 
priceless pearl, 
It serves me right for being such a 
spooney, 
So young lads beware, of this factory girl take care, 
Or like me you'll become a 
perfect looney. 
I 
brought her, & c. 
PICADILLIE. 
Some fellas' think the Doves the spot 
For the creme de la creme, 
And crawl into the monkey house, 
To hear their brothers scream; 
While some declare that Belgrave Square, 
The Eden of the west, 
To meet with swells and dashing belles, 
But by Jove I 
know the best. 
CHORUS. 
Picadillie, Pieadillie, for the elegant swells 
And fairest of belles; 
:1 hat s 
where I 
reside when in town. 
Some dines I 
do a 
gentle crawl, 
By Jove I've gone that far, 
That I 
have nearly knocked against 
That horrid Temple Bar; 
Once I've hailed a 
Hansom cab, 
Hackman here, come here, 
011! drive me home directly, 
Or by Jove to hall la queer. 
Picadillie, 66c. 
Some time into the Burlington, 
Our cads a 
fella dropped, 
Because a 
fella cannot bear, 
Those common sot t 
of shops; 
The dozy Beadle knows me there, 
As he walks up and down, 
1101 call me captain, touch his hat. 
That costs a 
half a 
crown. 
Pieadillie, &c 
But this butterfly existence, now 
With me will soon be past 
For liymen soon will lead me in 
ilk sorrows fetters last, 
.1 shall shortly pop the question, to 
The child of an 111. P— 
pm sure to he aecepted, 
60 it's all up with me.

DOLLY DOT. 
Sting by Miss ‘,TENNIE ENGEL. 
I'm told that once there lived a 
maid, 
Whose name was Dolly Dot, 
And while her Pa soled boots and shoes, 
She sold potatoes, hot; 
He never stirred from out his stall, 
But Dolly had to roam, 
For she repaired to Madison Square 
'While he repaired at home. 
CHORUS. 
Dolly Dot was handsome, Dolly Dot was fair, 
Dolly Dot potatoes hot sold in Madison Square; 
Oh Dolly Dot was charming, Do'ly Dot was gay, 
And just the sort of a 
girl to steal a 
fellow's heart away. 
Now as she earned her daily bread 
'Tis said that it befel, 
She won the heart of one who came, 
His daily bread to sell ; 
So gay was he that in his coat 
A 
flour was always found, 
And he went round the Square because 
The Square was in his round. 
[
1] 
Dolly Dot, & e. 
DOLLY DOT. 
[CONCLUDED. 
But Dolly had a 
black amour 
A chimney sweep so cute, 
And as she helped the black-a-moor, 
She looked upon his soot; 
An all persuading tongue had he 
And was such an adept, 
That all he cried was chimneys weep 
And then the chimneys wept. 
Dolly Dot, ttc. 
These two heroes were bosom friends 
Until it came about, 
That they fell in with Dolly Dot 
And then they both fell out ; 
Beside poor Dolly's can they met 
For her fair hand to fight, 
And soon they had the matter up 
And down in black and white. 
Dolly Dot, & c. 
The baker soon began to tire, 
For dough is tender stuff, 
And when they'd a 
bout or two 
He'd had about enough ; 
The lucky chimney sweep thus proved 
His right to Dolly's' champ:, 
And soon his sweetheart new unto 
IIer love's victorious arms.

I'll go a

CHANT—She thereupon tore her best chignon to smithereens, 
danced the " Can-can" on top of the water- butt, and joined " the, 
woman's rights association," and frequently edifies the angelic 
members by softly chanting— 
Dinkle doodle dum, dinkle doodle dum, 
That's the kind of soul-inspiring song she sung, 
Dinkle doodle dum, dinkle doodle dum, 
Oh! the bold fisherman.

HURRAH FOR THE EMERALD ISLE 
There's a 
health to the friends that are far, 
There's a 
health to our friends that are near, 
Here's to those who rank first in the war, 
Oh the brave hearts that never knew fear I 
Here's to him who for freedom first draws, 
And here's to the heart free from guile, 
The patriot friend to his home and his laws, 
Who stands by his own native isle. 
Then hurrah for the Emerald Isle I 
And here's to the bosom's bright glow, 
When the banner of liberty waves; 
And here's may she conquer her foe, 
Ere the sons of her glory be slaves ! 
Then here's to the friends all around, 
The emblem of Erin's rich soul, 
And oh ! may they ever, when wanted, be found 
To stand by their own native isle. 
Then hurrah for the Emerald Isle I 
THE VESPER HYMN. 
Hark, the vesper hymn is stealing 
O'er the waters, soft and clear— 
Nearer yet, and nearer pealing, 
Now it bursts upon the ear : 
Jubilate,  
Amen. 
Farther now, now farther stealing, 
Soft it fades upon the ear 
Now, like moonlight waves retreating 
To the shore, it dies along, 
Now like angry surges meeting, 
Breaks the mingled tide of song. 
Hark I 
again like waves retreating 
To the shore, it dies along.

THE SWELL OF WASHINGTON SQUARE. 
Sung by Miss JENNIE ENGEL. 
At a

Some few months ago; 
I

To an elegant beau, 
He danced and conversed 
With such distingue air 
Said lie was the Swell

CHORUS. 
He had light curly hair, features so fair, 
Said that he'd win me or die in despair: 
In style, oh so charming his love he'd declare, 
And he was the swell of Washington Square. 
He sat next me at supper. 
Days after we met, 
And oh ! what he said, 
I 
shall never forget. 
Ile told me lie 'oil(' me, 
And vow'd then and there 
To ! Lake me the lady 
Of Washington Square. 
He had light curly hair. (

And I

For fear I 
should fall, 
Of my love and good fortune

He had light curly hair, & c.

AL D E, WrrT, 33 Rose Street. ".Sce five cents.) 
The soldiers gather on the green, 
With IL.,arts so full of martial joy, 
And in an humble cot was seen, 
A 
mother bending o'er her boy; 
"My place is in the ranks to- day," 
lie cried to her in tones of woe, 
" 
An I, mother dear, I 
must away, 
My country calls, and I 
must go; 
But if I'm sav'd, U 
mother dear, 
Thy boy to thee will quickly come: 
I 
hear their martial foot-step drawing near,— 
Toe trumpet sounds, hark ! the drum." 
CHORUS. 
The trumpet sounds, the trumput sounds, 
Don't you hear my country's calling ? 
The trumpet sounds, the trumpet sounds, 
must away, my time has come; 
The trumpet sounds, the trumpet sounds; 
I 
must away my countr:i's 
Forward. march ! forward, march ! 
The trumpet sounds, hark I 
the drum. 
Forward ! forward! forward ! hark the drum. 
A 
long and weary year had passed,— 
The mother sits alone, and sad, 
her bitter tears are are failing fa- t, 
She sadly mourns her soldier lad ; 
4` 
Why did he go ?" she sadly cried, 
" 
Who never injured any one, 
fear lie with the wounded lies, 
Or with the dead, my only son ! 
But, hark a sound falls on mine ear ; 
Is it fancy ? no, no, my boy, has come! 
I 
hear his well-known footsteps drawing near, 
Ile has returned, hark ! the drum." 
The trumpet sounds, the trumpet sounds, 
Welcome back, our country's glory; 
The trumpet sounds, tile trumpet sounds, 
Ile has rettirned with rank and fame, 
The trumpet sounds, the trumpet sounds, 
Its trumpet tongue speaks forth its story, 
Victory! victory 
lie has returned, hark I 
the drum. 
SHE RAN AWAY TO FOREIGN CLIMES. 
As Sung by TONY PAsTOR. 
I 
sat inc down and wrote a 
song, 
I 
wrote it well, I 
wrote it long, 
At every line I 
shed a 
tear, 
At every verse I've lost my dear. 
My will will brealc and I 
shall die, 
And when I 
think, it makes me sigh, 
That I 
should love with such a 
love, 
And now I've lost my turtle dove. 
Cimitus. 
She ran away to foreign climes, 
She loves the man who plays the chimes. [Repeat. 
_Tier name was Susan Sarah Jane. 
And don't you think it quite a 
shame 
That I 
should pine in such like times 
Just for a 
man that plays the chimes? 
She's not so tall, but very lime, 
Alas, she never can be mine ; 
Her eyes are large and very bright, 
Her mouth is small, with teeth so white. 
She ran away, crte. 
She's curly hair, as dark as night, 
Her skin is fair as lilies white; 
Her cheeks are like the blushing rose, 
A merry laugh and Roman nose ; 
She's rather stout and full of pride, 
And when she walks she takes a 
stride; 
She swings her arms with such a 
grace, 
No Venus e'er had such a 
face. 
She ran away, & C. 
I 
decked my hair with violets blue, 
To let you know I 
loved her true ; 
I 
bound my calves in black and white, 
Because I 
lost my heart's delight ; 
My coat I 
changed to cabbage green, 
Which means forsaken by my queen; 
3Iy corpus thus in colors slashed, 
To let you know my heart is mashed. 
She ran away, 6te. 
I'll seek some spot where lambkins play, 
And gently breathe my grief away. 
Where little pigs and ducklings quack, 
You 11 find me stretched upon my back, 
Anil in my hand a 
carving knife, 
To let you know I 
took my life, 
Through loving one that ne'er loved me, 
Because defunct for love of she. 
She ran away, (te

I 
married sweet Lucinda Long, 
And blessed the lucky catch, 
But soon found out she was so strong, 
I 
was not near her match; 
For at our wedding breakfast, oh! 
She gave the guests a treat, 
By seizing me by the hair of my head, 
And lifting me off my feet—Cno. 
Instead of walking down the stairs, 
She'll clear the flight at a 
bound, 
Catch hold of me by the tail of my coat, 
And swing me round and round; 
She throws half-hundred weights about, 
And twirls the Indian club, 
Or balances two chairs and the eat 
On top of the washing-tub. 
SPOKEN—And frequently winds up her performace by throwing 
an astounding somersault from the water-butt on to the dust-
bin,—Cno. 
She does the dumb-bells twice a 
day, 
(A terrible weight they are), 
In the garden she's fixed a 
high trapeze, 
And a 
horizontal-bar; 
And there she sports her lovely form, 
To the neighbors who come and stare, 
To see my wife—the pride of my life— 
Going round and round in the air. 
SPOKEN.—Or practising the somewhat difficult feat of hanging 
by her eyebrows. 
If I 
dare to remonstrate with her she threat-
ens to throw me into the next street; says she's certain she could 
do it " once in three times." 
Horror! I 
believe she could; too;

PUT BY FOR A RAINY DAY. 
(Mimes the world may laugh, and jeer at what I'm going to 
say, 
That is, provide yourselves, my friends, in case of a 
rainy 
day; 
For if you don't, when you grow old, on what I 
say depend, 
If you can't help yourself, ' tis hard to find a 
friend. 
CHORUS. 
So now be careful, and be wise, and, like me, stow away, 
A 
little pelf, to protect yourself, in case of a 
rainy day; 
Be not extravagant or mean, have just what you require, 
Be kind and provident to all, it is ruy heart's desire; 
When I 
see my fellow creature is trodden down with strife, 
To help him on the road is a 
proud time of my life. 
So now be careful, &c. 
" 
Waste not, want not," my motto is, a 
maxim I 
would teach, 
And this another I'd prescribe : " Touch nothing out of reach ;" 
For " honesty's best policy," so honest people say, 
And just remember, though but small, put up for a 
rainy day. 
So now be careful, & c. 
A 
pin a 
day, is a 
groat a 
year, which proves that the smallest 
mite 
Put by will soon accumulate, and shows my words are right; 
So persevere when in your youth, and then when old you'll say, 
I 
care not now how the world treats me, I 
thought of a 
rainy day. 
So now be careful, & c. 
I'm hale, I'm jolly, as you can see, and I 
like my friends to call, 
Though the best of friends I've ever found, was my pocket, 
after all; 
For that old friend sticks to me still, through thick and thin, 
I 
say, 
If you would be advised by me, put by for a 
rainy day. 
So now be careful, & c. 
" 
A friend in need's a 
friend indeed," but how often wheim 
you're poor, 
Those friends will pass you one by one, and on you close the 
door ; 
So let your motto be like mine, whate'er the world may say, 
Look out for number one, that is— put by for a 
rainy day. 
So now be careful, ,tc..

Your sweet face adorn with gladness 
Thinking still of me. 
Don't you cry so, &c. 
Don't you cry so, Norah, darling,

Don't you cry so, Norah, darling,

THE KISS BEHIND THE DOOR.—NONCLUDED. 
Of an evening after tea, 
While her Daddy blow his 'ham,' 
I'd seek my love Rosanna, and 
Ask her to share my lot. 
But when he found it out, 
Oh my ! how he would whack her, 
While I'd jump over the garden wall, 
As tho' I'd just been shot. 
I 
shall never kiss my love, cte. 
I'tjumped over the wall one night, 
In search of sweet Rosanna, 
And tho' I 
gently whistled, 
My love did not appear; 
But my hair stood bolt upright, 
For out came her dad the tanner, 
Oh I 
my teeth they rattled like dominoes, 
And my legs doubled up with fear. 
Spoken—At the end, of our interview I 
felt convinced that he 
understood what 'tanning' was, and so did I. 
I 
also conclued. 
I 
should never see my love, ,Sze. 
Some say she's hid away, 
By her cruel Dad on purpose, 
To cure her of her love for me. 
Some say my love's no more. 
If she's defunct, then soon 
Shall they find my clay cold corpus, 
And our ghosts shall come and frighten her Dad 
Behind the kitchen door. 
So I 
used to kiss Rosanna just behind the kitchen door, 
But I 
ne'er shall squeedge my darling's little finger any more, 
And shell ne'er pinch my funny-bone, until it's rather sore,

MARY OF THE WILD MOOR. 
It was on one cold winter's night, 
As the wind blew across the wild moor, 
When Mary came wandering home with her babe, 
Till she came to her own father's door. 
Oh, father, dear father, she cried, 
Come down and open the door, 
Or this child in my arms will perish and die, 
By the wind that blows across the wild moor. 
Oh, why did I 
leave this dear spot, • 
Where once I 
was happy and free ? 
But now, doomed to roam without friends or home, 
And no one to take pity on me. 
The old man was deaf to her cries; 
Not a 
sound of her voice reached his ear; 
But the watch-dog did howl, and the village bell toll'd, 
And the wind blew across the wild moor. 
But how must the old man have felt, 
When he came to the door in the morn, 
Poor Mary was dead, but the child was alive, 
Closely pressed in its dead mother's arms. 
Half frantic he tore his gray hair, 
And the tears down his cheeks they did pour. 
Saying, this cold winter's night, she perished and died, 
By the wind that blew across the wild moor, 
The old man in grief pined away, 
And the child to its mother went soon; 
And no one they say, has lived there to this day, 
And the cottage to ruin has gone, 
The villagers point out the spot, 
Where the willow droops over the door, 
Saying, there Mary died, once a 
gay village bride, 
By the wind, that blows across the wild moor!

I 
fell in love with a 
pretty girl, 
A few shot t 
years ago. 
All sorts of weather, bail or rain, 
To court her I 
would go; 
I'd long and sigh with love until 
'Twas time to be away, 
And when I 
asked a 
parting kiss, 
She always used to say: 
Oh, mother says I 
mustn't, mother says I 
mustn't! 
Oh, George. please. George, not just yet awhile ; 
Mother says I 
mustn't, mother says I 
mustn't I 
Oh, George, don't, George, not just yet. 
I " waiting" kept, at last, one day, 
I 
thought I'd know my fate, 
I 
sunk upon my knees in quite 
An agonizing state; 
" 
Selina, say you'll have your George, 
And when shall we be wed 7" 
I 
longed to hear my love's reply, 
And this is what she said— 
Spoken—Well, George, dear, you're very kind, but we could nrvor 
live on two hundred a 
year, so until you are worth at least live 
hundred per annum, darling— 
Mother says I 
mustn't, & e. 
Prom then I 
went to work, by Jove! 
I 
left no stone unturned, 
rntil five hundred pounds a 
year. 
At last I 
really earned; 
Selina beard how things had changed, 
And when we met ot e 
day, 
Sbe seemed so pleasant,.and at last 
She lovingly did say — 
spoken—You remember, George, dear, what I 
said when you asked 
tile some time ago,—well, George, dear, as you have so improved in 
circumstances, suppose you ask me now, Georgy, Porgey, darling I 
eh, what say? 
Well, said I, upon consideration you're very kind, but— 
Mother says I 
mustn't, &e. 
Give me the girl who loves a 
man, 
And loves him for himself, 
Whose first consideration is, not 
What he's worth in pelf: 
All sordid-minded damsels, who 
May worship golden dross. 
May they be old maids till they die, 
And we'llnever feel their lo,s— 
Spoken—So ladies who don't want to be old maids, mind you, don'i 
once too often say— 
Mother $ ays I 
mustn't, &c.

We reached the Park at two r. M. , and wandering we went, 
On where to find a 
shady spot that we might pitch our tent, 
And soon we found a 
quiet spot where we could sit unseen, 
To smoke a 
pipe, to sing a 
song, or dance upon the green; 
We introduced the eatables, the bottled stout and beer, 
With sundry drops of something short, our sinking souls to cheer ; 
When Sister Sarah Sprig,ginbottom begged that Brother Pim 
Would sing her Champagne Charlie and she would sing a 
hymn. 
Then you may go to Blackpool, dr,c. 
Now when we'd done with Doctor Watts we took a 
turn at Bass, 
And drank success to temperance in many a 
flowing glass, 
We pledged each other manfnlly in wines of every sort, 
The women doing ditto in a 
drop of something short; 
We satisfied the inner man, then cleared the crumbs away, 
We danced and sung, declaring we had spent a 
happy day; 
Then had a 
game at kiss in the ring, and kissed each other's wives, 
And vowed it was the jolliest day we'd spent in all our lives. 
Then you may go to Blackpool, tie.

Never look obstinate, sulky or glum, 
Wait till your married, my dear. 
Never stand prating, keeping him waiting,

Put on your bonnet he's here, 
Never look obstinate, sulky or glum, 
Wait till you're married my dear. 
Lightly, sprightly, trip down the stairs, 
Ask him to fasten that hook, 
Hum him his favourite Trish air, 
Tell him we're reading his book, 
Set him off talking, on that, while you're walking, 
Say that you wish so to have it explain'd; 
The thoughts are so deep, love, it sent me asleep, love, 
But you, you've a 
husband you know to be gain'd. 
Lightly, sprightly, trip down the stairs, 
Ask him to fasten that hook, 
hum him his favourite Irish air, 
Tell him we're reading his book.

WHY DON'T I 
CHANGE MY NAME. 
I've chances had to change my name. 
And so to do I 
mean. 
But 0:i ! it seems I 
never shall, 
I've so unlucky been ; 
Mv name's a 
nice one—Fanny Gootl— 
It looks well in a 
letter ; 
1'%-,
-ow who would change the name of Good 
Unless twere for a 
better ? 
My Pa, my Ma, they scold they fret. 
But I 
am not to blame, 
Altho ugh from morn till night they ask. 
Why don't I 
change my name? 
had a 
beau—I 
liked him too, 
At Brighton twas we met ; 
Ilk whiskers were Dundreary ones, 
Their color blac& as jet : 
Mania, Papa, went out one day, 
Left us at home quite snug—he 
Went down upon his knees and said, 
Will you be :Mrs. Buggey ? 
That such a 
nice young man should have 
A name like that's a 
shame, 
I 
told him. No. 
And yet they ask. 
Why don't I 
change my name? 
The course of true love never did 
Run smooth they do declare; 
Another beau I 
found—thought I, 
I 
need not yet despair ; 
He wrote fine sonnets to my eyes 
He brought me charming books, 
But when he did propose I 
found 
Ilk name was Mr. Snooks! 
Of course I 
cried and told him he 
Must go from whence he came— 
And yet they tease me still and say, 
Why don't I 
change my name ? 
T MIS at a 
ball just after that 
A partner I 
did gain, 
He pressed my hand—and how he sighed 
When we did ladies' chain ; 
He called next day--arvnin—again-
At last, thought I, 112'11 speak-
[1] 
WHY DON'T I CHANGE MY NAATE—ICoscLunicp. 
I 
felt ashamed when out it came, 
Sweet love be Mrs. Cheek! 
Upon my cheek I 
felt the blush, 
It must have glowed like flame— 
I'm single still—and still they say, 
Why don't I 
change my name ? 
Both Mr. Quick, and Mr. Slow 
Have sought my hand in vain; 
I 
Mr, Lush and Mr. Low 
Forbade to come again ; 
Young Gimlet tried to pierce my heart 
But he, like Butcher failed; 
And Fish and Fags, and Bragg and Briggs, 
All tried but none prevailed. 
I 
would not hesitate I 
vow, 
If Mr. Wright but came, 
And yet they tease me still, and ask, 
Why don't I 
change my name? 
I 
could have done with Smith or Brown, 
Have put up with a 
Jones, 
Or even with a 
Robinson, 
That name so many owns ; 
Alas! they never came to me, 
My way they didn't jog : 
The nicest man I 
ever knew, 
ilk name was Mr. Hogg ! 
'Twas Hogg or none my parents said, 
I 
cut him all the same, 
A rasher match could I 
have made 
For Hogg to change my name ? 
A rose by any other name. 
They say would smell as sweet, 
Alas ! it never was my fate 
A Mr. Rose to meet: 
A 
single maiden still' am. 
In spite of all my trouble, 
I 
would be White or Black. or Dunn, 
Or even Mrs. Double. 
I 
would not be particular. 
But have I 
been to blame 
For ugly names like these to say 
I 
would not change my name?

First we (lanced, and then we sang, our voices thro' the whole house rang, 
And all enjoyed themselves, but I

found out I 
was in love, for cousin Fred call'd me a

When he'd kiss'd me the second time, I 
heard Big Ben commence to chime, 
The clock struck twelve, and then you know I 
thought it was quite time

had enjoy'd the fun, 
So Freddy thought ' twouldn't be amiss just to steal another kiss.

GENTLEMEN'S VERSION. 
When I 
a-courting first began, I 
really was a 
shy young man, 
For I 
feel in love with pretty Fan, forget that day -I 
never can; 
For as we were making hay, she sigh'd and said, 0 
lack-a-day; 
Then I 
blush'd as red as apple pips while gazing on her ruby lips. 
Chorus.-I 
kiss'd her once, how ashamed I 
was; 
I 
kiss'd her twice, how ashamed I 
was; 
I 
kiss'd her thrice, I 
thought it was nice, 
Bat goodness knows how ashamed I 
was. 
And when I 
saw her pretty feet, and rosy lips like cherries sweet, 
I 
felt as tho' I'd lost my heart, and vow'd from her I'd never part; 
She blush'd. and then hung down her head, and in a 
whisper I 
to her said, 
Tell me, darling, what's amiss, then her pouting lips besought a 
kiss. 
Chorus.-I 
kiss'd her once, (tc. 
And when I 
asked her if she'd wed, but goodness knows now, what she 
said, 
My head spun round just like a 
top, and I 
really thought she would drop; 
Iler heart was beating like a 
clock, which gave my feelings quite a 
shock, 
At length she stammeed-Yes-and then I 
gave her such a 
kiss. 
kiss'd her once, & c. 
Now I'm a 
happy married man, contented with my little Fan, 
And never shall forget the day, we lost our hearts while making hay; 
I 
dance, I 
whistle and I 
sing, for I'm more happy then a 
king. 
And for the little ones, some people say, Fan and I 
are making bay.

By the golden river's shore : 
And my heart it yearns with sadness,

Sweetly now the angels carol, 
Tidings from our loved ones far, 
That she still does hover o'er us,

By the golden river's shore : 
And my heart it yearns with sadness, 
When I

For I'll think of her as sleeping, 
Not as dead, but gone before.

THE GAL THAT SIGNS HERSELF " LU." 
As Sung by TONY PASTOR. 
Ax :—" Rosin the Bow." 
Have you seen the philosopher's darling, 
Who thinks Eddy Booth's so divine, 
And that poor Annie Dickinson's taper 
Is shockingly dim in its shine ; 
Who rustles in silks she has paid for, 
And holds up Sir Horace to view, 
Twirling round in the Redowa polka— 
'
l'
he gal that signs herself Lu? 
This damsel so tenderly nurtures 
The best moral plant ever grew, 
She's skill'd married folks to unmarry, 
And rivet their fetters anew. 
But lest she should fly to the zenith, 
When the Tribune cries hastily " shoo !" 
There's a 
string always tied to the ankle 
Of the gal that signs herself Lu. 
Pretty women, whose husbands are shiftless, 
She advises to sidle away, 
Provided kind gentlemen willing 
To see them safe home from the play. 
When Beecher her mandate peruses, 
He carries his mummeries through, 
His will and his judgment he losses 
For the gal that signs herself Lu. 
Oh, had I 
the knack of composing 
Such letters as flow from her brain, 
What a 
treasure I'd be to old Bennett; 
I'd never be seedy again. 
But since it is folly to wish it— 
Free lovers, I 
know what to do— 
If she's ready— hey ! " onward to Richmond" 
With the gal that sins herself Lu.

Pity my sorrow and melt at my woes, 
What I've put up with you would not suppose, 
how I've been treated and snubbed all along, 
Listen to me and I'll tell in my song; 
When but a

In the last form I 
continued to aest, 
Getting well flogged when I 
tried to rise higher, 
Twas out of the frying pan into the fire.

Out of the frying pan, out of the frying pan, 
Perhaps you may fall, if too high you aspire. 
Out of the frying-pan, out of the frying-pan, 
Out of the frying-pan, into the fire. 
When tired of leading a 
bachelor's life, 
Looking around Tile I 
sought for a 
wife, 
Met with an angel with manners so soft, 
Face like a 
cherub's that sits up aloft. 
Oh ! how I 
picture our lives free from care, 
happy as Dicky-birds up in the air, 
But such a 
temper had darling Maria 
Twas out of the frying-I) . n

Doating on children, to badies endeared,

when first twins appear'd 
But the next year they were triplets we had, 
Somehow or other I

so glad ; 
Now at my table twelve mouths do I 
see. 
Hungry and open and waiting for me, 
Why did I

Once I

Twenty per cent was the dividend paid,

THE MAID OF ERIN. 
My thoughts delight to wander, 
Upon a 
distant shore; 
Where lovely, fair and tender, 
is she whom I 
adore. 
May Heaven its blessings spariag, 
On her bestow them free, 
The lovely maid of Erin, 
Who sweetly sang to me. 
Had fortune fix'd my station, 
In some propitious hour, 
The monarch of a 
nation, 
Endow'd with wealth and power 
That wealth and power slim ing, 
My peerless queen should be, 
The lovely maid of Erin, 
Who sweetly sang to me. 
Although the restless ocean, 
May long between us roar, 
Yet, while my heart has motion, 
She'll lodge within its core ; 
For artless and endearing, 
And mild and young is she, 
That lovely maid of Erin, 
That sweetly sang to me. 
When fate gives intimation, 
That my last hour is nigh 
With placid resignation 
I'll lay me down and die; 
Fond hope my bosom chew ing, 
That 1 
in H av _ hall see 
The lovely maid of Erin, 
That sweetly sang to me.

As she for me cares not a

The soldier got seven years for life, 
So Polly never became his wife, 
The Bobbv made sure she'd be his bride. 
But she preferred " sweet suicide."

In sadness— not even cold meat 
Delights his gaze—he feels so glum, 
And nightly he dreaubi of the born ! horn ! bc;io

MY NATIVE LAND SO GREEN. 
Sung by W . 
F. 
S. 
LAWLOR at Mr. Cuts. MACEvoi's Original 
Ilibernicon. 
I 
am A. true- born Irishman, I 
come from Paddy's land, 
Where the stranger finds a 
welcome with the grasp of friendship's 
hand ; 
Where the wit it flows spontaneously, and pleasure does abound, 
And good-nature, tnix'd together, in abundance can be found. 
Where the boys are all so jolly, at a 
pat tern, race or fair,

PRETTY MISS RICKETTS, 
THE GROCER'S MAID. 
Oh! a 
sadly pitiful story's mine, 
Just listen, and you shall hear, 
How naughty Miss Ricketts, the Grocer's maid, 
Once treated her swain so de.ar ; 
For I 
fancied her heart was mine, and thought 
How happy we both should be. 
Oh ! naughty Miss Ricketts, the Grocer's maid, 
How badly you treated me! 
CHORUS. 
So in love—yes, in love! 
So in love with the fairest site, oh ! 
Naughty Miss Ricketts, the Grocer's maid, 
Was all the world to me; 
Oh ! naughty Miss Ricketts, the Grocer's maid, 
Was all the world to ! 
For her eyes were as bright as little stars, 
Her manners were kind and frank, 
She said she'd a 
couple of building shares, 
And cash in the Savings Bank ; 
She looked like an angel in cotton print, 
Weighing up sugar and tea, 
Oh! naughty Miss Ricketts, the Grocer's maid, 
how badly you treated me! 
So in love, & c 
Otis blissful night, ' twas her Sunday out, 
She promised that she'd be mine, 
how little I 
thought on that moonlit night, 
Her fortune was all moonshine ; 
Tint I 
married her soon, and found I'd got, 
Instead of a 
fortune small, 
With pretty Miss Ricketts, the Grocer's maid, 
A temper, and—that was all! 
Su in love. & c. 
She grumbles and scolds from morning till night 
I 
fancy I 
hear her now! 
'Tis the voice of my dear angelic spouse, 
I 
must go or there'll be a 
row. 
All you who would wed for money, take care, 
That first the money you see, 
And think of Miss Ricketts, the Grocer's maid, 
And how she behaved to me! 
For I 
was so in love, & c.

DIY NATIVE LAND SO GREEN. 
Sung by W. F. S. LawLoa at Mr. CILts. MAcEvor's Original 
Hibernicon. 
I 
am 
true- born Irishman, I 
come from Paddy's land, 
Where the stranger finds a 
welcome with the grasp of friendship's 
hand; 
Where the wit it flows spontaneously, and pleasure does abound, 
And good-nature, mix'd together, in abundance can be found. 
Where the boys are all so jolly, at a 
pattern, race or fair, 
For courting purty girls,none with them can compare ; 
They're the bravest set of boys that ever yet were seen, 
The boys of dear ould Ireland, my native land so green. 
You will surely find that Paddy his aid will always lend, 
And be ready to assist you, if e'er you want a 
friend; 
If his cabin you should enter, you know as well as use, 
he'll treat you with the very best—quite welcome you will be. 
Hell share his pipe and whisky, your spirits he will cheer, 
Oh! mild Ireland, you're my darling—the spot I 
love so dcar; 
For true hospitality—no matter where I've been— 
There's no place like ould Ireland, in 
native land Bo green. 
If e'er you're bent on pleasure, abroad you need not roam, 
There's no such sights in foreign lauda like those we have at home 
Killarney's lakes are beautiful, as every one must own, 
And if your fond of nonsense, just kiss the Blarney stone.

shy! I can't pass a stay-shop, be-cause I'm so shy. 
Some people go to the theatre each night, 
To see actreses dress'd eomme ilfaut, 
But I 
never will cast my eyes on the stage 
Unless the foot-lights they put low; 
There's the ballet girls too, so graceful to view, 
To see them is streteh'd ev'ry eye; 
To some this is good, but 'tis not to me, 
For I 
feel most awfully shy, 
Ballet girls' movements are all very well, 
But I 
feel so wretchedly shy. 
Cno.—Shy, shy, shy, shy I 
Oh I 
I'm so shy—dreadfully shy, 
Shy, shy, shy, shy! 
I 
would, if I 
could, but I 
can't; I'm so shy. 
For all I'm so shy, I 
once fell in love, 
To my sweetheart no question could pop, 
For hours I 
would sit by my loved one and say— 
Nothing 1 
and then I 
would stop; 
She put the question, I, blushing, said "yes," 
Got married—I 
felt I 
should die, 
To think of the future, tears came to my eyes, 
I 
felt so terribly shy, 
Yes, to think of the future, tears came to my eyes, 
For I 
felt so uncommonly shy. 
CH0.—Shy, shy, shy, shy! 
Oh! I'm so shy—dreadfully shy, 
Shy, shy, shy, shy! 
When I 
put on the ring I 
was awfully shy.

THE DAISY VALLEY. 
I 
met her in the valley, where the daisies grow, 
I 
felt that I 
must love her, yes, if she would or no; 
It was a 
happy day, full well, full well. I 
know, 
I 
met her in the valley where the daisies grow. 
She was fair to me, as fair as fair can be, 
No damsel yet was half so fair as she; 
She vowed that she'd be true to me 
Down in the valley whe• e 
the daisies grow, 
CIIORIJS. 
The daisies oh ! the daisies oh ! 
DOW11 in the valley where the daisies grow ; 
It was a 
happy day, full well I 
know, 
Down in the valley where the daisies grow. 
I 
woo'd her in the valley where the daisies grow. 
And where beside a 
streamlet the water-lilies blow; 
It was a 
happy moment when first she let me know 
She lov'd me in the valley where the daisies grow, 
Ah, twas a 
joy to me, my heart was full of glee, 
When she agreed my loving bride to be, 
And vow`d that she'd be true to me, 
Down in the valley where the daisies grow.

MOONLIGHT, STARLIGHT, DAYLIGHT. 
While going thro' this brilliant world, 
So many lights we see, 
There's moonlight, and there's starlight, 
And daylight makes the three ; 
They are the three great lights, we are told, 
At least we'll let them be, 
For daylight is a 
jolly time, 
And moonlight shines so free. 
CHORUS. 
Moonlight, starlight, daylight or other lights, 
Rushlight, sunlight, no niatter what they be, 
Gaslight. nightlight, candlelight or limelight, 
Skylight, lamplight, are pleasant unto me. 
First moonlight shines so brightly, 
The stars they glitter so ; 
The daylight shows us daily, 
Wherever we do go : 
The gaslight burns so gayly, 
While the rushlight's glimmer glow; 
The best and dearest of all things 
Is light, that we all know. 
_Moonlight. &c. 
On day I 
purposed that I'd go, 
The Palace for to see : 
The sun was shining bright that day, 
The birds sung out their glee. 
The day it passed. the. evening came, 
While sitting down to tea, 
A bird came whistling in my ear, 
And singing merrily. 
Moonlight, &c. 
It shines on man and woman, 
It shines on cattle too ; 
But most I 
hope sincerely, 
It shines on all of yon. 
It shines on houses, and on lands, 
The waters and its view, 
how pleasant of a 
sunny day, 
When the sky it looks so blue. 
Moonlight, &c.

I'd do all sorts of wonders if I

I'd have the earnest worker paid his credit and his due, 
Nor have the toil of many made the pleasure of the few 
I'd put a

Their proper place at home and let some idle woman go.
