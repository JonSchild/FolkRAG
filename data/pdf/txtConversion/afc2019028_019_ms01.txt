Abstract: Dwight “Cap” Greer is a farmer in Lyles Station, an historically Black farming
community in Gibson County, Indiana. He is descended from members of the Lyles family, who
moved to Indiana in the 1830s, a generation after the earlier African American homesteaders
arrived. The Lyles were long-free people of color (originally from Virginia), who had
homesteaded the Tennessee frontier in the 1810s before rising racism- including the loss of their
right to vote or bear arms – forced them to leave Tennessee in the 1830s for Indiana. He
discusses many details of farming and what it meant to be a person of color in southern Indiana.
He also discusses details in changing farming techniques including his personal experience with
the toxicity of certain herbicides and pesticides used in farming at the time.
