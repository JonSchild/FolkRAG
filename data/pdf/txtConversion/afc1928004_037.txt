Wearing of 
the Green. 
(As supg by T. 11. Wormy, as Shaun The Post, in Arrah 
•a 
Pogue:) 
Oh, Paddy dear, and did you bear, the hews that's 
going round, 
The Shamrock 'is !forbid 'by law, to grow on ' Irish 
ground; 
St. Patrick's day ;no more-we'll keep, his color can't 
be seen, 
For there's a 
bloody law ag'in 'the wearing of the 
green, 
, . 1 . 
4 • 
I 
met with Napper Tandy, rand the tuk 
o' by tho 
hand, 
And he said hew's ' poor ould'Ireland, and how 
does she stand„ 
She's the latest distressful country, that ever you 
have seen; 
They're hanging- men ,and women there, .for wearin.' 
of the green.

Wearing of the Green Songster. 
Then since the color we must wear, is England's 
cruel red, 
Sure Ireland's sons will ne'er forget the blood that 
they have shed; 
You may take the Shamrock from your hat, and 
, 
cast it on. the sod, 
But ' twill take root and flourish still, tho' under 
foot"tis trcid,t1 
t 
When the law can stop the blades of 'grass, from 
growing as they grow, 
And when the leaves in summer- time, their verdure 
dare not she.*' 
; 
Then I 
will change the color tbat I 
wear in my 
caubeen; 
But till that day, plase God, I'll stick, to wearing 
of the green. " 
But if at last our color should, be torn from:Ire-
land's heart, , 
Her sons with shame and sorrow from the dear onld 
soil will part; 
I've heard whisper of a 
country, that lies far be-
yant the say,s° 
Where rich and poor stand equal in the light of 
freedom's day, 
Oh, Erin, must we lave you, driven by the tyrant's 
hand, 
Must we ask a 
mother's welcome from a 
strange 
but happier land, 
Where the cruel cross of England's thraldom never 
shall be seen ; 
And, where, thank God, we'll live and die, still 
wearing of the green.

Right hearty was the welcomo

For years gone by he fully proved

How well he loved the Green; 
And there was one amongst them 
Who grasped him by the hand—

He brought them news from gallant friends

Street Ballad. 
'Tie now we'd want to be wary, boys, 
The recruiters are out in Tipperary, boys ; - 
If they offer a 
glass, we'll wink as we pass— 
We're ould birds for chaff in Tipperary, boys. 
Then hurrah for the gallant Tipperary boys, 
Although we're "cross and contrary,' boys, 
The never a 
one will handle a 
gun, 
Except for the Geeen and Tipperary, boys. 
Now mind what John Bull did here, my boys;' 
In the days of our famine and fear, my boys: 
He burned and sacked, he plundered and racked, 
Child Ireland of Irish to clear, my boys. 
Now Ball wants to pillage and rob, my boys, 
And put the proceeds in his fob, my boys; 
But let each Irish blade just stick to his trade, 
And let Bull do his own dirty job, my boys. 
So never to list be in lii,aste, my boys, 
Or a 
glass of drugged whisky, to taste, my boys; 
If to India you'll go, 'tisto grief and to woe, 
And to rot and to die like a 
beast, my boys.

But now he is, beat forpen, nay boys, 
His army is getting so thin, ihyi boys, 
With the fever and ague,the sword and the plague, 
Oh! the devil a 
fear that he'll :win, my boys.

Then mind- net the robbing - Ould sch6rner, -boys, 
Tho' he SaYS that he's richer,than iDamer, 
boys, 
Tho' he bully and roar, his `power is o'er, 
And his black heart will 
be tamer, boys 
Now isn't Bull peaceful and civil, boys, 
In his mortal distress and:his-evil, boys t 
But we'll cock ' each caubeen when his sergeants 
are seen, 
And we'll tell them to go to the devil, boys. 
Then hurrahlor the gallant Tipperary, boys!' 
Altho' we're cross and contrairy, bays, 
The never a 
one will handle a 
gun, 
Except for the Green and Tipperary, boys.

Tim Fini&an Hied ia Walker street, 
A 
gentleman Irishman—mighty odd— 
He'd a 
beautiful brogue, so rich and Sweeti,( 
And to ride in the world he earried the hod; ' 
But you see he had a 
sort of a 
tippling way :

One morning Tim was rather full, 
His head felt heavy, Whichniade him shake, 
lie fell from the ladder and broke his skull; 
So they carried him 'home his corpse to wake 
They, rolled hir . up :in a 
nice clean sheet „ 
And laid hirn out upon the bed,. 
With fourteen candles round his feet, 
And a 
Ponple pf doien around his head. 
His•friends assembled at his wake, 
I, 
Mania Finigan called out for the lunch : 
First they laid in tay and cake, 
Then pipes and tobacky and whisky punch. 
Miss Biddy 'O'Brien began to cry: 
Such a 
purty corpse aid ever you see,-, 
Arrah! Tim avourneen, an' why did ye die'? 
Och, none of your gab, sez Judy -Magee. 
Then Peggy O'Conner took up the job, 
Arrah,-Biddy says she, ye'er wrong I'm sure, 
But Judy then gave her a-belt on :the gob, 
I 
left her sprawling ,on the ure. * 
Each side in war did soon engage: 
'Twas woman to woman and man to man; 
Shillelah law was all the rage, 
And a

When. a

And we cheered up our spirits, by letting some 
down. 
When I 
got her snug into a 
corner, 
And the whisky 'began for to warm her, 
She said her sweet-heart'was an informer, 
°ch.! it was then I 
said prayers for my stick. 
We got whiskyficated to such a 
degree, 
For support poor Kate had to lean against me; 
promised to see her safe to her abode, 
By the tarnel we fell clean in the' mud, on the road. 
We were roused by the magistrates order 
Before we could get a 
too further— 
Surrounded by peelers for murther, 
Was myself and my innocent stick. 
When the trial came on,,Katty swore to the fact, 
That before I 
set too, I 
was dacently whacked,, 
And the judge had a 
little more feeling than sense, 
He said what I 
done was in self defence. 
But one chap swore again me named Carey, 
(Though that night he was in Tipperary) 
He'd swear a 
coal-porter was a canary, 
To transport myself and my stick. 
,SVhen I 
was aquitted I 
leaped from the dock, 
And the gay fellows all 'round me did flock; 
I'd a 
pain in my shoulder I 
shook hands so often 
For the boys all imagined I'd see my own coffin. 
I 
went and bought a 
gold ring sirs, 
And Kate to the priest did bring, sirs; 
So next night 'you come I 
will sing, sirs, 
,The adventures of me and ink stick.

Paddy Conner's Wedding. 
'Twas last Sunday' morn, to me the news was car-
ried, -
That Pat and Judy Conner, were going to be mar-
ried. 
I 
saddled my donkey quick, and gave him such a 
whack, 
With my shillelagh stick, I 
was after them in a 
crack., 
Chorui. 
Oh, what joys, nothing we 'were dreading, 
Roaring boys, were all at Padily's wedding. 
So then I 
rode away, till I 
came to mother Leary's, 
There I 
heard them say, they were going unto St. 
Mary's. 
I 
flew there in a 
trice, and there was such a 
rout, 
Together they were spliced, 'and all a-coming out. 
Oh, what joys, etc. 
Together then we strolled to Judy Conner's mo-
ther, 
In the door we rolled, one a- top of,t'other. 
There was Larry; Kate, and a 
dozen more; 
Patrick with his head he split the cupboard door. 
Oh, whit joys, etc. 
We all sat on the ground, singing altogether, 
The whisky it went round, with hearts as light as a 
feather. 
There was strong beer, ale and toast, butter to 
spread the crumpet, , 
A 
little pig to roast, all your bellies to comfort. 
Oh, what joys, etc. 
38 Wearing 'Of the Green Songster. 
The supper being done, ' twas break of day in the 
morning, 
We swoie we'd have some fun, and fear and danger 
scorning; 
I 
gave Conner such a 
blow,eause he hit my mo-
ther—' • 
And all at once you know, we fell whacking one 
another: 
• 
Oh, what joys, etc. 
Jist like a 
lump of lead, together we both went 
down, 
Against the bedstead leg, I 
broke his collar bone. 
Then Conner, out of spite, to please his heart's de-
sire, 
He ran and got alight and set the house on fire! 
Oh, what joys, etc. 
'We all ran out together, were frightened out of 
breath, 
The goods, and every feather, they all were burnt 
to death, 
Away we all did run, but not a 
word we said, 
I 
saw no more of the fun, but tumbled into bed. 
Oh, what joys, etc. 
Billy O'Rourke. 
I 
greased my brogues and cut my stick 
In the latter part of May, sir, 
And up to Dublin I 
did sail, 
To walk upon the sea, sir. 
To England I 
resolved to go, 
To cut the hay and corn, 
And among the cockney girls to dante, 
From night until morn.

I 
met a 
man in College-green, 
And ax'd him the way to the quay, sir, 
He was seated on a 
big white horse, - 
And not one word would he say, sir, 
Neither hat, nor spur, nor whip he'd got, 
And both his stirrups he had lost; 
Says I, " my boy, if your horse does stir, 
In the street you'll surely be tost." 
With my kitty ma-cm, etc. 
I 
gave the captain six thirteens, 
To carry me over to Pargate, 
But ere we got on half the'road, 
It blew at the devil's own hard rate. 
The big stick that grows out of the ship, 
Sung'out like any whistle, 
And the sailors all both great and small, 
Swore we were going to the devil. 
With my killy ma-cru, etc. 
Now some were on their bended knees, 
The ladies were a 
fainting, 
But I 
fell on my bread anecheese, 
Determined to mind the main thing. 
Says the captain, " Are you not afraid I" 
Says I, " I 
don't care a 
farthing; 
I've paid you to bring me to Pargate, you 
know, 
And faith you must stand to your bargain." 
With my killy ma-cru, etc. 
But soon the wind sung itself to sleep, 
And we came to the place of landing; 
The gentlemen who were most afraid, 
The ladies out were handing; 
Says I, " My boys I 
have no doubt,

As I 
was going along the road, 
I 
met a 
gentleman, sir. 
" 
Good morrow to you, sir," said I, 
But e 
proved a 
mighty toad, sir, 
For at the corner of a 
lane, 
He pulled a 
pistol out, sir, 
And clapped the muzzle to, oh! what a 
shame, 
Up to my very throat, sir. 
With my hilly ma-cru, etc. 
"Your money, bad scran to your Irish eyes!" 
"Be merciful," cried I, sir, 
But he swore he'd blow out both my eyes, 
If I'd either stir or cry, sir. 
His pistol to my head did pop, 
Two steps I 
did retire, 
The pan it flashed, his head I 
smashed, 
Och, shillelah, you never missed flre!

Kate Kearney. 
Oh ! did you not hear of Kate Kearney'? 
She lives on the banks of Killarney; 
FrOm the glance of her eye, shun danger and fly, 
For fatal's the glance of Kato Kearney. 
For her eye is so modestly beaming, 
You'd ne'er think of mischief's she's dreaming; 
Yet oh ! I 
can tell how fatal's the spell, 
That lurks in the eye of Kate Kearney. '

Who lives on the banks of Killarney; 
Beware of her smile, for many a

Though she looks so bewitchingly simple, 
There's mischief in every dimple; 
And who dare inhale her mouth's spicy. gale, 
Must die by the breath of Kate Kearney.

The Irish Haymaker. 
And did you ne'er hear of an Irish haymaker, 
One Mr. O'Rafferty 7—Then'it is me, 
And my father he was, he was a

And I 
am the whalebone he danced on his knee.

Oeh, an't he the devil the lasses to smack, -

Sing up and down frisky, and fire away whack. 
There's Jttdy M'Brawn, and, I 
no'er will forsake

One day to be sure I 
looked into a

But for love and, for theiving I'd always an itch-

So I 
took out the mutton and popped'in the cat. 
Then, what d'ye,think, etc. 
Och, luck to sweet summer, the fields. and the 
lasses, 
For sure we don't frisk it up hill and down dale; 
And then the dull hours so merrily passes, 
When we can't catch the pig for the grease on 
his tall. 
But the best joke of all, and its joy past express-
' ing, 
E'n the thought of now makes me burn with de-
light, 
Is Shelah's soft lips when I 
give her a 
blessing, 
While we roll in the hay on a 
sunshiny night. 
Then what d'ye think, etc.

And no one to be kind.

But, Dennis, perhaps they'll mend, 
You would not leave your Norah 7 
You yet may want a 
friend." 
You would not, etc. 
"Yes, Norah dear, I'm going, 
And yet it breaks my heart, 
To see your eyes are flowing, 
With tears because we part, 
'Tis sad to leave old Erin, .r

Och; ' twas herself I

She said she loved me in return—her cheeks were

red and rosy; 
Of sovereigns I 
had twenty, says she, I've seven-
teen, 
Faith, we'll join ourse..res and them together, and 
live like king and queen. 
So we both set sail for Liverpool, and packed our 
kits together, 
And married got so neat and cool, in spite of wind 
and weather; 
With our money we opened a 
shop in business not 
amiss, • 
We sold oysters, haddocks, mac'rel,, mussels, pra-
tics and fried fish. 
• 
In business we did well, till one day she was taken 
ill, sirs, 
And the doctor almost ruined me, by sending in his 
bill, sirs ; 
So I 
made a 
bargain with him " kill or cure" for 
twenty pounds so frisky, 
lie was a 
decent sort, so I 
thought I'd stand a 
nog-
gin of Irish whisky. 
But she grew worse and worse, which made me 
quake with fear, sir, 
.The doctor he attended her for more than half it 
year, sir; 
!fill one fine morn she died, and myself it did bo,-
wilder, 
And the doctor he wanted his twenty pounds, 
(spoken) says I 
you never cured her ! 
No says he—then says I, (singing) you dare not 
say you killed her'! 
So gentlemen enjoy yourselves, the whisky drink 
like thunder ; 
You can not help but own yourselves, there's mirth 
in an Irish blunder. 
But when for your wives a 
doctor you wan't, mind 
and yer be sure, 
Make the bargain as I 
did myself, wid the doctor

read the newspapers, although I'm 
thought a

And I 
hear the French and English—they have 
taken Sabastopol; 
But if they come to Ireland, these jolly sons of 
Mars, 
Shall have a 
day's diversion‘on the Irish jaunting 
car. 
When the Queen she came to Ireland her health 
for to revive, 
She asked the lord-lieutenant would he take her 
out to drive 7

But if they only volunteer, they need not fear the

I'll drive them all to Italy, in my Irish* jaunting

They say the Austrian bear is tough, and I 
believe 
it's true, • 
He peppered was at Magenta, and at Solferino 
too; 
Bat if the Connaught Rangers had brought home 
the Russian Czar, 
I'd have driven him to blazes in my Irish jaunting 
car. 
And when the war is over, and I 
hope that soon it 
will, 
This stunning jaunting car of mine was never 
known to spill ; 
And then may every Paddy here, never want 
whisky , in the jar, 
To drink success to Larry Doolan and his Irish

For fighting there never was such; 
He, and the Emperor Nero, 
Conquered the French and the Dutch.

And with shipping they tried to make port, 
But their progress was safely prevented, 
By Queen Bess at Tilbury Fort.

woke with the cramp in my toes, 
And found they were bound with a

I 
opened my mouth for to spake, 
But the sheet was shoved up to my chin again, 
Says I—Molly I'm awake—says she hold your 
tongue, 
You're going to be buried with M'Finnigin.'

Full of whisky from the burring, sure; 
She showed as much mercy to me,

gave her, 
Which made her to cry and to grin again,

To the land of the oak, and its neighbouring earth, 
Where grow the shillelah and shamrock so green.

Thrash thei, foes that would plant on their confines

United and happy at Liberty's shrine, 
May the fern and the laurel long flourish and

Round the sprig of shillelah and shamrock so

The Green above the Red. 
Air : " Irish Molly 0 
I" 
BY THOMAS DAVIS. 
Full often when our fathers saw the Red above the 
Green. 
They rose in rude but fierce array, with sabre, pike, 
and midis, 
And over many a 
noble town, and many a 
field of 
dead„ 
They proudly set the Irish Green above the Eng-
lish Red. 
But in the end, throughout the land, tho shameful 
' sight was seen— 
The English Red in triumph high above the Irish 
Green ; 
But well they died in breach and field, who, as 
their spirits fled, 
Still saw the Green maintain its place above the 
English Red. 
And they who saw, in after times, the Red above 
the Green, 
Were withered as the grass that dies beneath the 
forest screen; 
Yet often by this healthy hope their sinking hearts 
, were fed, 
4 
That, in some day to come, the Green should flutter 
o'er the Red. 
Sure it was for this Lord Edward died, and Wolfe 
Tone sunk serene— 
I3ecause they could not bear to leave the Red above 
the Green ; 
And 'twas for this that Owen fought, and Sarsfield 
nobly bled— 
Because their eyes were hot to see the Green above 
the Red. 
• 
So, when the strife began again; our darling Irish 
Green - 
Was down upon the earth, while high the English 
Red Was seen; 
Yet still we hold our fearless course, for something 
in us said, 
" 
Before the strife is o'er you'll see the Green above 
the Red." 
And 'tis for' this we think and toil, and knowledge 
. 
strive to glean, 
That we may pull the English Red below the Irish 
Green, 
And leave our sons sweet Liberty, and smiling 
plenty spread 
Above the land once dark with blood—me Green 
above the Bed! 
The jealous English tyrant now has banned the 
Irish Green, 
And forced us to conceal it like a 
something foul 
and mean; 
But yet, by Heavens! he'll sooner raise his victims 
from the dead 
Than force our hearts to leave the Green, and cot-
ton to the Red. 
We'll trust ourselves, for God is good, and blesses 
those who lean 
On their brave hearts, and not upon an earthly 
king or queen; • 
And, freely as we lift our hands, we vow our blood 
to shed 
Once and forever more to raise the Green above the 
Red.!

Oh! and He Loved Me Dearly. 
There was a 
young man came a 
cottrting of me, 
Singing, " Oh ! my dear and I 
love you dearly 1" 
The nicest young 'man as ever I 
did see, 
Singing, " Oh ! and I 
love you dearly !" 
He was so tall, and he was so smart, 
When he asked I 
to marry him it made I 
start, 
And his words went right clean through my heart, 
Singing, "Oh! and I 
love you dearly 1" 
Says he, "I 
must manage to find two-poll:id-ten"— 
Singing, " Oh! my dear, and I 
love you dearly I 
And as soon as I 
get it, we'll be married then, 
For it's oh! and I 
love you dearly! 
'Tis to pay clerk and parson and the ring to buy.", 
" 
I've got money in the savings- bank myself," 
says I, 
" 
Will you lend it me V " Of course I 
will," was 
my reply, 
" 
For it's oh! and I 
love you dearly !" 
When five golden sovereigns to him I 
lent— 
Singing, " Oh! my dear, and I 
love you dearly !" 
And he shoved I 
the ring, and I 
felt quite content 
Singing, "Oh! and I 
love you dearly !" 
"I'll be off to the parson at once," says he; 
So he did and got married, but it warn't to me; 
And, my money or *
trii lover never more did I 
see — 
And it's oh! that he loved me dearly! 
• 
MORAL. 
Now all you young women take a 
warning of me, 
When they say " My dear, oh! I 
love you dear-
ly !" 
Never lend chaps your Money as I 
did to he, 
Singing, " Oh ! and I 
love you dearly !" — 
If they can't find the money for to buy the rings, 
Who's to pay for the victuals and such like thingsl 
For it's often for your money that a 
fellow sings, 
That it's " Oh ! hue' love you dearly !"

Oh, Katty avourneen, you must let me in." • 
"Ah, then Barney," says Kate, and she spoke 
through the window, 
" 
How could you be takin' us out of our bed 1 
To come at this time it's a 
shame and a 
sin, too, 
It's whiskey, nob love has got into your head. 
If your heart it was true, of my fame you'd be 
tender; 
Consider the time, and there's nobody in; 
What has a 
poor girl but her name to defend her'? 
No, Barney avourneen, I 
won't let you in." 
" 
A-cush-la," says he, " it's my eye is a 
fountain, 
That weeps for the wrong I 
may lay at your 
door; 
Your name is more white than the snow on the 
mountain, 
And Barney would die to presarve it as pure. 
I'll go to my home though the winter winds face 
me, • 
I'll whistle them off, for I'm happy within, 
And the words of my Katty shall comfort and 
bless me." 
• 
No, Barney avourneen, I 
won't let you in.' 
Mister Barney O'Toole. 
Mister Barney one day went to Limerick fair, 
And hired a 
noddy to carry him there, 
To meet pretty Shelah Megan; 
But Sholah, who'd waited some.time for the boy, 
And thought he'd been courting with Kate Molloy, 
To tell him her mind thus began— 
" 
Och, Mister Barney, 
None of your carney— 
Hands off, and don't be so free; 
You've been with the 'girls. 
Your muffin face tells, 
And the devil may have you for me, Mr. Barney. 
Mr. Barney, who little thought thus to be used; 
Made oath that his honor and word she abused, 
And cduld she be Shelah Megan 1 
Then running to kiss her—she cried, " If you're 
wise, 
Don't touch me, or Barney, I'll scratch out your 
eyes, 
I 
know you're a 
vile wicked man. 
So. Mr. Barney, etc. 
Mister Barney then pulled out a 
bit of a 
rope, 
And told her that since he had nothing to hope, 
He'd hang up for Shelah Megan; 
But Shelah, grown softer, his purpose to check, 
Cried, " No, if you hang, let it. be round my neck, 
Though, Barney, arn't you a 
sad man 1 
Och, Mr. Barney! 
s 
Pretty-fad Barney, 
And is 1
it the ring there I 
see 1 
We'll ride in the noddy 
To'Father 0"Toady, 
And married, och, oh, won't we be, Mistei Barney.

The Three Best Irish Romances ever Written. 
PRICE TWENTY-FIVE CENTS EACH 
TEE PMNIA_I•T CHIEF; 
OR, THE MARTYR OF ' 65. 
This book describes, most graphically, the bold attempt of a 
young, ardent, whole-souled Irishman to assist in :freeing his native 
land. 
Mingled with the exciting incidents now progressing in the 
Green Isle, through the efforts of the powerful organization, Fenian-
ism, are some of the most pathetic love passages ever portrayed; 
while they in their turn, are chequered by descriptions of rich and 
racy drollery. 
This is a 
book that would duct hosts of readers at any 
time—now it will be read by almost everybody. 
SHAMTTS 0'131R.IMI•T; 
OR, THE ROULD BOY OF GLENGALL. 
The very title of this book explains its scope and nature. The 
young hero, O'Brien, lives and will ever live in the hearts of his 
countrymen while the green triple-leaved type of immortality and the 
trinity carpets the sod of Old Ireland. 
In this book, the author has 
contrived to give us one of the best books we have ever read in many 
years. 
It is full of stirring incident, of marked character, drawing, 
and the plot is full of rare interest. 
OR, TIIE WICKLOW WEDDING. 
[Founded ou the celebrated play. by Dion Borcecault, now performing in the United 
States, Great Britain, aud Australis.] 
The verdict a 
Te11.3 of thousands of unbiased spectators have 
pronounced this play ( and consequently this story formed upon it), 
to be one of the most natural and affecting pieces ever produced. 
Never for an instant overstepping the probabilities of real life, it ex-
ceeds in the power of affecting the feelings the mosi; labored produc-
tions of the greatest writers. 
The lovely, artless heroine, Arrah 
Meelish, might stand for the embodiment of the pretty, true-hearted 
Irish girl; while Shaun of the Post, is a 
capital type 'if the peasant 
class: here too, we have a 
lifc-like picture of the infernal " informer," 
that creature who has blighted the hopes of Erin's truest sons, and 
crimsoned the scaffold with patriot blood. Nor are there wanting 
other and capital characters to enliven and lend interest to the pages 
of " Arrah-na-Pogue." and make every gratified reader wish they 
might be present, and join in a 
jig at the next " Wicklow Wedding." 
Sold by all News Dealers, or sent, POST PAID, on receipt of price
