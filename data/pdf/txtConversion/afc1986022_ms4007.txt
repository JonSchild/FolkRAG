START M32 B(7)
Speaker: Mama is the grandmother of travis and uh mama well she inherited twenty
thousand dollars and uh so uh she got the money and she went out in this caucasian
neighborhood and uh they didn't want her out there but she bought this house and uh
well she bought this house well this it was this man his name was mr uh i forgot his name
well anyway he uh was trying to buy the house back but mama that was her name she
didnt want to sell it so since uh uh, walter was the man of the house, since her husband
had died and everything walter was the man of the hoUse and uh she put the money in
walter's hands and she said that if he didnt want the house that he can uh sell it to the
man so so anyway he didnt <unintelligible text> the man came at first he said he was
a welcome committee and uh but they found out that he was you know he was beating
around the bush and said that uh he was here to welcome them to their new neighborhood
and then he finally said why dont you stay uh where your kind is we dont want your kind
around here and uh so walter ordered the man out of the house he went out of the house
and I'd say about a week later they moved to their new house and it was a group of white
caucasians i think uh people they came and uh they uh was trying to order order the negro
family out of their house but they didnt so uh what walter did he said if you want trouble
you can get trouble but as long as you dont start no trouble you dont get no trouble and
after that they was

Speaker: friendly ever since and uh (ques) they was friendly and uh mama well uh ruth
and well mama she uh she well she wanted a a backyard of her own always and uh
but this house it had a big backyard and it was a pretty house and that was where she
always had wanted that was what her husband wanted her to have before he died he even
worked his fingers to the bones just to get a house that pretty for them to live in and the
she always wanted a a garden so what travis and uh ruth and uh <vernitta?> and walter
did well they got her some garden tools and they uh uh travis bought her a pretty hat and
uh she liked it very much and uh she was so surprised that she started crying and she said
thank you jesus thank you and uh she said my uh then she said that her uh dream had
finally come true and uh ruth well she was pregnant at the time but she didnt want to tell
walter because she didnt think walter would could afford it so uh what she did she waited
awhile and when they got in the house and everything they was celebrating and everything
and uh she said walter i got something to tell you then he said what and she said i think
you better sit down so uh he sat down and then uh he told her and he said another one
just like that <unintelligible text> and uh she said look i can always have an abortion and
he said a bad word but i dont think i should say it and uh ques) like hell no and uh so
she said she said i can always uh get rid of it and he said if you ever if i ever caught you
getting rid of my baby me and you gonna me and you gonna have it out and so they was
all happy and everything and uh they liked their house very much and uh so anyway well
the true point is that uh caucasians some caucasians are prejudiced when they first moved
into this neighborhood uh the caucasians they didnt want them to live there because they
they uh thought all negroes was troublemakers but they just dint want to give uh the negro
family a chance thats what some uh people need today is a chance but some uh people
dont realize that
Speaker: and uh uh another point is that no matter uh where you go or what you do or
how hard you please or how hard you struggle there always gonna be prejudice and
uh you always will find uh hatred in others but they dont want to give like today some
caucasians dont want to give the negroes a chance they want to down them all the time

but i think thats terrible and uh i dont like it myself thats why im gonna finish school and
do whatever you know do as much as i can because i like school myself and uh well i
gotta lot of caucasian friends but now since they you know they're all right when theyre
not around their friends but when theyre around their friends theyre different but i dont pay
that no mind cause it goes in one ear and out the other and uh well some caucasians they
well they'll like help sometimes but most of the time the majority of them are prejudiced
idont know why but theyre prejudiced i dont think theres no hope for them if you ask me
there might be a little hope for us but what what is prejudice gonna get them it aint gon get
them nowhere cause its not gon it aint gon do nothing if you ask me theyre hurting theirself
its really fear theyre scared prejudice is a feeling of fear a prejudgement of other people
and uh they just dont know they think that that all colored people are alike negro people
are alike but they just dont want to give us a chance but in order for us to like when i was
young my grand my great grandmother used to say dont let shed say dont give up quick
she said if you give up if if you give up quick that theres no hope for you but if you sorta
struggle a little bit she said the harder you struggle that sometimes if they see you that is
they uh see that youre trying to make it theyll help you but most of the time they just say
look at you but you have to really put a little pep into it if you want to get somewhere today
because today likfe is just as hard as it was in that day they those days that was about in
the roaring twenties or something like that
Speaker: but see they want all of us to stay down a lot of time but they gotta realize that
we cant stay down forever no matter what they how hard they try or what they do they cant
keep up down forever not ill ill tell them ill speak my mind in a minute think nothing of it i
might think something of it but i wouldnt sometimes you just have to put them in their place
sometime and uh(ques) uh up north prejudice isnt as bad as it is down there down south
if uh a negro boy touched a white girl or kissed her or something he can get in jail for that
and they cant even hold hearings down there but uh they some of them well they go to
different schools and everything but up here its different i see a lot of caucasians going
around with a whole lot of negro people i see uh negro girls going with caucasian boys

but down there you if a negro boy went with a colored boy he could get life or that he cant
even go with her down there i think thats stupid when will they ever learn i said to myslef
and uh so my mother my grandmother she died and my mother brought me up here and
so you know i was family and everything when i first came here they was really friendly
and they still is but some of them they just have to show how big and bad they are and the
people that go for bad that went for bad are six feet under the ground so thats why it pays
you to keep cool and live your life as you want it to be and be yourself and nobody else
long as you be yourslef youre all right but if you try to be somebody else there aint no hope
for you i dont think there's any hope for anybody like some of them they like to you know
they tries to copy you but why copy? ques) like uh for instance dancing if they cant dance
as good as the negro let them dance the way they want to dance negroes cant dance the
way white people dance thats their business and they always meddle in other people's
business thats one point they cant keep their minds to theirself they always (ques) like uh
uh lets see now like if somebody get
Speaker: in trouble well they always come over and say what happened what happened
whats this and all that instead of them ignoring that see long as you ignore somebody that
makes them real mad and they want to kill you but if you stand there and you argue and
all this jazz well that makes them want to fight and you not gonna stand up there and just
let them hit you just like that andthen you gotta take up for yourself but when you do all
that you just gotta give it to them cant let them take over you like that you know if you let
one time if you you could let them slip you you know just let them go past you know they
keep on bumping up into you and all that like everybody it can be anybody and theyll try
to start trouble some of them will its not all the time the negro that'll start trouble its most
sometimes its the caucasians they start trouble too because even when you're walking
down the hall in the school uh high school and theyll bump up into you and uh they dont
even say excuse me or im sorry and you know that makes you mad i know i get mad
sometimes but i i kinda have to control my temper sometimes because i got a bad temper
and uh anyways I just let itslide but you know so if you let it slide slide slide they gone

afc1986022.afc1986022_ms4007
keep on doing it and you gotta just take up for yourself cant just let them slide all the time
you gotta knock them around a little bit and then theyll leave you alone and thats the way
some negro sometimes thay can be jealous of you and uh some caucasian'll be jealous of
you too but dont pay that no mind long as you uh uh pay any attention to that jealousy you
bound to be dead in another year because trouble starts only when uh a person you know
if you ignore it well you aint got nothing to worry about but if you stand here and argue
and all that i think thats real stupid i dont think people you know if they argue just stand up
there arguing i mean just look at them they get real mad they cant do nothinc but look
and uh well you're standing there and they're arguing you leave them there arguing and
they look stupid that makes them look stupid and uh they get real mad they cant do
nothing but get mad and and uh when you leave them alone they they give you the eyes
and everything but whats the eyes gonna do you as long as <unintelligible text> in there
ahead and theyre arguing youre all right but some kids they dont realize that they think
fightings gonna solve something but sometimes fighting do but most of the time i dont
think it solves nothing it only gives you gets you all bruised and all that and whats the big
bruise and black eyes and all that (ques) have i ever foughten yeah acouple of times ques)
well it was this friend of mine see she couldnt stand me because see she said i had this
feeling that i was cute and everything see i didnt pay that no mind anyway she give me
the eyes and everything id just look at her and go on about my business and uh lately she
had you know she was bumping up into me and she wouldnt say scuse me but you know
i just let it slide and i let it slide let it slide but the third i let it slide twice i dont let you slide
twice if you gonna do it the third time im just gonna have to tell you off and uh so she it
was uh on a friday and uh she bumped all into me and uh i fell down all over myeslf and
then i pushed her off of me and she got mad and she was doing uh a lot of fumbling but
you know all that i wasnt saying nothing i was just standing there you know and that made
her real mad and so she took my hair and she start pulling it and she pushed a handful of
it i said i said i said now what you get out of pulling my hair see that made me mad and
then i had to do soemthing i just couldn't stand there and let her pull all my hair out you
