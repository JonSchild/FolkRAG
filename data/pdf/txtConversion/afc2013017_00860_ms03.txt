Introduction. Mary Hoefferle interviewing elementary art teacher Joann Keen 
at Jefferson Elementary School in Oshkosh, Wisconsin on September 12, 2013. Joann read and 
signed release form. 
00:00:25 
Number of years teaching and job preparation: Taught for 28 years k-8, taught 
in Rosendale for seven years, then 21 years in Oshkosh. Attended UW Oshkosh and had a BA 
degree in Art Education. Professional development includes six credits of graduate courses 
every five years. Took credits in art, behavioral issues/programs, technology.  
00:03:35 
Typical day on the job and weekly class schedule: arrive at school at 7:40. Basic 
prep. Leave the building for 45-minute lunch, go home, let dog out. Class begins at 7:55. Full 
load is six classes per day, but she is only 9/10ths not full time. Range from four to six classes 
per day. Administration arranges the art schedule for what’s best for the classroom teachers, 
to accommodate longer literacy blocks. 50 minute classes back to back, sometimes a break in 
between. Teaches at Washington MWF, Jefferson on Tuesday and Thursdays. Her car is her 
office – lesson plan books, supplies unless it’s really hot. Check email first thing in the morning 
and few times during the day. Set up in the morning, clean up when kids leave.  
00:10:05 
After school activities: Students leave at 2:30. So, students are required to stay 
until 3:15. I stay usually until 4:00 to get everything done. Every single day is a different time 
schedule and changes from year to year. Art teachers have no input in the schedule, but 
principals do consider their needs. Brings artwork home to mount and label it. Assess student 
work and enter grades in computer at home. Does the research for lesson and lesson plans at 
home. 
00:13:22 
Pros of the job: Joann loves this job. She felt that she was called to do this work. 
Inspired by a book on children’s drawing development. Whenever she was around kids, they 
seemed attracted her. She loves art, loves kids and their expressions and sayings. Can’t 
imagine doing anything else. It’s fun, fresh, and tiring. It affects social life – say no in order to 
have energy to teach and need silence after school to refresh mind. All consuming and 
draining but worth it. Work with kids, teach art, and MAKE art. 
00:17:21 
Cons to teaching elementary art: Change the schedule – make sure art teachers 
get grade levels back to back instead of a first, second, third grade classes in a row. Makes 
material preparation complicated. More money for supplies. Change the amount of time for 
classroom teachers – they need more time do all the new assessments. They are frustrated 
and crying. Their time is shrinking.

Relationships with co-workers: Really good relationship with principals. All have 
been phenomenal. Main social time is lunch hour, so she misses out. Both schools have social 
clubs – teachers go out for drinks or dinner monthly. She catches up socially with teachers 
when they drop off their classes in the art room.  
00: 23:12 
Teacher turnover: At Jefferson, only four teachers stayed from last year, a mass 
exodus of teachers and got a whole new staff, which really get along and have fun with each 
other. Conflicts among staff members. This is a one-on-one ipad school, so some teachers left 
because of it. Principal left last year. Took jobs in different schools and districts. In the past 
couple of years because of politics, teachers are tired, overworked, underpaid, stressed. Don’t 
do much socializing because the job is demanding and raising children.  
00:28:33 
Relationships with other art teachers: when the union was busted, central 
office changed collaboration time. Art teachers then had to attend building level action 
meetings, but this year district art meetings reinstated monthly. Elementary art teachers got 
together on their own to share lessons, ideas, community art exhibits. The art staff is basically 
new and very supportive. 
00:31:44 
Relationships with other staff: Good rapport with custodians. She tries to keep 
the room clean so they aren’t burdened. Everybody is so busy, the pressure keeps everyone 
moving even though they all want to talk. Custodian gets supplies from the top shelf. 
Secretaries are life-savers. Staff camaraderie: There is always joking, we are always laughing 
about the funny things kids do. 
00:36:00 
Salary and morale issues: Salary schedule honored number of years of teaching. 
Salary increased with number of years and number of graduate credits. This schedule is no 
longer in place. Maxes out at 16 years of experience and 30 credit hours. No cost of living 
raises at this point. Her take-home pay has been cut by $4,000 since governor cut the state 
education budget. Income is decreasing because of higher insurance premiums and pension 
contributions. Many teachers retired early to secure current retirement benefits. People are 
anxious. Haven’t seen morale this low ever. Teachers breaking down and cry in staff meetings. 
Students have so many social problems – the job is demanding because of shortage of time 
and money but also seeing kids with severe problems is heart breaking.  
00:45:40 
Changes in the profession over the course of 28 years: Kids used to be more 
settled –more emotional and social problems and mental health issues. More kids with 
autism. Decline in administration and decision makers giving teachers professional freedom to 
do what they think kids need. More emphasis on testing. Kids and teachers stressed about 
tests. Less and less about critical thinking. Fixated on superficial assessments. Violence in 
schools has increased – have lock down drills. See parents with severe problems. Bigger 
bureaucracy – its much harder to get kids help right away because they aren’t labeled special 
needs.

Parent relationships: Rarely have parents attend parent teacher conferences. 
Some children want to share their parents the artwork, but specialist contact with parents is 
not like classroom teachers. Usually don’t contact parents. Joann tells classroom teacher. 
Severe behavior needs to be addressed formally with a written letter. Kids love to come to art 
and are well behaved most of the time. I see 350 students per week, so for all those kids, I see 
very few parents. No parent volunteers. PTO parents stop in. 
00:55:03 
Art teacher stereotypes: When she tells people she teaches art, they say, “Oh 
isn’t that neat, isn’t that fun,” or “I was never good at art. I can’t even draw a straight line.” 
00:55:54 
Teacher bashing: Another thing that has changed – I used to be proud to tell 
people I’m a teacher, now I’m afraid to tell anyone. I overheard people at the hair salon who 
were saying negative things about teachers. They said that those teachers don’t work and now 
they want a new school and want brand new computers. Then, I overheard people at a 
restaurant – those teachers are so lazy, they don’t work in the summers. All of sudden people 
don’t like teachers anymore. The political climate in the state contributed to this attitude. 
Joann feels division in schools between specialists and classroom teachers. One teacher said 
that it just isn’t fair that she has to work so hard with testing and assessments and the 
specialists just float in and out of school even though they have the same contract and are 
paid the same as her. They are resentful. They see it as an injustice. Hear the teaching bashing 
in the public and in her workplace. 
01:05:38 
Advice for new teachers: This is a really awesome job/career. Don’t make 
waves. The boat sails smoother, people get along better. Some people love conflict – don’t 
make trouble. Be calming. Compromise. Work with people. Give of yourself. Go the extra mile. 
01:09:56 
Subject area hierarchy: Joann feels that other people don’t think art is as 
valuable as other subject areas. Art is in the curriculum to give other teachers prep time. Some 
people know how important phy ed, music and art are important for the whole human being. 
Some communities value art more than others. In a farming community, art isn’t valued as 
much as in an university town.
