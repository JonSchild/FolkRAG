yellow hair,Who once came a courting my father's gray mare!""It was not the gray mare a-courting I
came,But you, my sweet Katty, sweet Katty by name.But since it is thus, it is, oh, that I am sorry,It is,
oh, that I am sorry for what I have done!" 2 2 of 2Young Johnny the Miller"Your sorrow," says Kate, "I
