Aaron Paige (00:00:00): 
Today is Friday, May 6th, 2022. My name is Aaron Paige, spelling A A R O N. Last name P A I G E. Today, 
I'm here with my fellow interviewer, Elinor Levy, spelled E L I N O R. Last name L E V Y. Today, Elinor and 
I will be interviewing Cynthia Miha as part of the Archie Green Fellowship project titled "Community 
Health Workers in Downstate New York." Cynthia, would you please state and spell your full name for 
us? 
Cynthia Miha (00:00:37): 
Good afternoon. My name is Cynthia Miha, C Y N T H I A, Miha M I H A. 
Aaron Paige (00:00:46): 
Cynthia, when and where were you born, and where did you grow up? 
Cynthia Miha (00:00:51): 
I was born in Manhattan, and I was born 1960. 
Aaron Paige (00:00:57): 
Where are you speaking from this afternoon? 
Cynthia Miha (00:01:01): 
I'm speaking from Inwood in the Bronx, Sun River Health. 
Aaron Paige (00:01:06): 
Thanks. 
Elinor Levy (00:01:08): 
So did you grow up in Manhattan, Cynthia? 
Cynthia Miha (00:01:11): 
Yes, all my life. Until I was about 18. I moved to Puerto Rico for a couple of years and from Puerto Rico, I 
moved to California. And then I moved back to New York. 
Elinor Levy (00:01:31): 
If you don't mind, why did you move to Puerto Rico? 
Cynthia Miha (00:01:35): 
I moved to Puerto Rico because I bought my grandmother a house. She wanted to retire and I got some 
money from my father. He passed away and he left me some money. So I decided to take that money 
and give it to my grandmother, because I was so grateful for everything that she's done for me. And 
then I wanted to make her happy. So I put a down payment on a house for her in Arecibo, Puerto Rico. I 
just wanted to give back to her because I was a foster care child through kinship on my father's side, my 
grandmother, on my father's side. My father passed away at 27 years old of stomach cancer. My mother 
didn't really want me, so she kind of gave me away to my father and walked away, never came back. So I 
just wanted to show my grandmother that I was appreciative of what she did for me. And the only way I 
knew how was to give her a home of her own. And I did that and she was very happy for a while, until 
my grandfather passed away of a double stroke. So a little while after that, she caught a stroke and 
wound up in California with my aunt, and she didn't get to enjoy the house at all. No she didn't. 
Elinor Levy (00:03:16): 
And where in California? 
Cynthia Miha (00:03:18): 
Daly City, California, next to San Francisco. 
Elinor Levy (00:03:22): 
I grew up in Oakland. 
Cynthia Miha (00:03:24): 
Yay. I love Oakland. Oh yeah, I love Oakland, I do. 
Elinor Levy (00:03:30): 
And what brought you back to New York? 
Cynthia Miha (00:03:33): 
I came back to New York because living with my aunt. Her name is Sylvia. I'm very honest with my life. 
My aunt was an alcoholic, and she was very verbally abusive to me, and I didn't feel comfortable. So I 
wanted to come back to New York and start my own life without my grandmother. And I did that. I came 
back to New York and found a furnished room and got a part-time job, and registered at Bronx 
Community College. Because I wanted to be a teacher and work with little kids. Through life, things 
didn't happen that way. I unfortunately ran into...let me take a breath before I say this. Unfortunately, I 
ran into people that I shouldn't have had ran into, and my life turned into a life of substance abuse and 
abuse from a spouse. I couldn't finish college, which I should have, but I didn't. I got addicted to crack 
cocaine. It's just not good after that. I have to tell the truth about myself. I'm sorry. 
Elinor Levy (00:05:17): 
No, Cynthia it's okay. 
Cynthia Miha (00:05:19): 
It's embarrassing because I should have known better. My grandmother was an excellent example as a 
grandmother and a mom. She went to school at the age of 40 and became a chef, a part-time chef. She 
showed me values and morals, and all that went out the window. And I'm embarrassed because I 
should've knew better. 
Elinor Levy (00:05:54): 
We all take turns in our life where we know better and we do it anyway, and the strength is when we 
realize... As long as one day we realize it, it doesn't matter whether we realize it the next day, 10 years, 
20 years later. If we realize it and we turn our life around, that's what's important. You know, it doesn't 
matter when it happens. It matters that it happens. And look at you now look. Look at you. 
Cynthia Miha (00:06:22): 
Thank you. I've been through some stuff. I got deep into drugs with my companion, who's now my 
husband. We smoked crack for the early eighties and I've never had to sell my body for drugs. He always 
went out and did what he had to do to get us money, to get high. I caught HIV. I caught HIV because I 
was raped by a gang of men. 13 men raped me all night long. They raped me in an abandoned building 
for hours. Because one of them, one of the men that raped me, I thought was a friend. And he sold me 
for a bag of dope. He told me, "I need to talk to you. Could you come down to the club? And I need to 
borrow $20." And I went and I took it because I didn't know any better. And he said, "Well, can you 
come to the back room? All the guys were hanging out with their girlfriends." And I went back there like 
a fool, and they kept me in the room, and they burnt me. They whipped me. They sexually abused me, 
any kind of way you could think about, they did it. And I wasn't supposed to live that day. They were 
supposed to kill me. And fortunately someone with a heart was able to tell me to get dressed, and he let 
me escape through the back door. And I ran for my life. I lived off of Fordham road, in the Bronx. I lived 
in a small furnished room, and I ran in my room and stood there for 15 days. I didn't come out. I didn't 
talk to anybody. And my next door neighbor knocked on the door and said, "What's going on?" And 
when she opened the door, I looked like death. She bathed me and made me some soup and took me to 
the department of health. And from there I got syphilis, gonorrhea and herpes from that rape. I took a 
test and that was the outcome. I got penicillin shots and pills. And I was okay after that. I went about my 
life and tried to forget, but you can't forget that ever. I'm 61 years old, and I will never forget that rape. 
And I tried to go on with my life, doing little odd jobs and just minding my business. I had no idea that I 
would be up here or any kind of help to anyone. I met someone, which is my husband now. His name is 
Ephron. Ephron is Hispanic and Pakistani. His family, there's a lot of them. A big family. He is a mechanic, 
or was, because he's retired. We hooked up and we made a son in the eighties. I have a son and a 
daughter. When I had my son Anthony in 1987, January 10th, 1987, I was very happy. And I finally found 
someone that would bring me joy. May 5th of 1987, Dr. Peter Marcus, at Montefiore Hospital told me 
would I like to take an HIV test? And I said, "What's that?" He said, "It's a test that they're giving out for 
AIDS." And I said, "What is that?" 
Cynthia Miha (00:10:27): 
You know, and he said, "Let's take it and see what's going on." Because he knew about the rape. And a 
couple of weeks later, I was asked to come in. He said, "You have HIV." I didn't know what that was until 
he explained it. The whole building heard me after that, because I cried. Anthony was only six months 
old. So in my mind, I wasn't going to make it. I already had a death sentence in my mind. And Dr. Marcus 
said "There's medication, and you'll be educated." I didn't want to hear any of that. I went back to drugs 
again because I thought I was going to die. And I dibbed and dabbed. We both did, my husband and me. 
I don't know. My faith is very big. I'm a Catholic. I prayed on it and asked for my higher power to give me 
the ability and the strength to get better and do right by my son. And I did. I stopped using for a long, 
long time. I was a mom. I joined a program, it's called the Women's Center. They no longer exists 
because they closed down. Through the women's center, I joined the adult daycare program. I went on 
trips. I met people with AIDS. I met people with different conditions, and that center had trainings and I 
was interested. I asked questions here and there and asked, "Could I do a training?" And they said, 
"Sure." I learned about HIV. I learned about self help, how to love me. I've always had a low self esteem 
about Cynthia. I don't think I'm worth anything in life. I think that I shouldn't be here. I don't love me. I 
don't. I suffer from depression, low self-esteem. I have issues with my mother leaving me because I 
don't understand why she would leave me and abandon me. This is very hard to talk about this, but I 
need to express it and let people know. Life is hard. 
Elinor Levy (00:13:08): 
Yes. 
Cynthia Miha (00:13:08): 
I'm Hispanic and Puerto Rican. My father is Puerto Rican. My mother is African American. She's from 
North Carolina. I have two cultures and... I don't like who I am. I don't. Never have and never will. But it 
is what it is. I have learned that giving back to the community is something that I need to do, because 
when I was an addicted to drugs, I had no one to help me. When I finally found someone, I was 
educated. I had mentors. I had people that were clean for 20, 30 years. I never did AA or any of that. I 
had to learn on my own how to be clean. I learned that women in power are everything. And men in 
power, too. Oh God, they teach you so much. I wanted to learn. I'm like a sponge, always asking 
questions, always taking notes. "Cynthia, why do you ask so many questions?" "Because I want to learn, 
and I need to give back what I didn't have." From HIV, I went to AIDS because I caught pneumonia five 
times in my lifetime. The last one, I almost died. Almost died, didn't make it. I was telling my son, "I love 
you and be a good boy", because I wasn't going to make it. But through the grace of God, I'm here. And I 
made it. My son is 35. Along the line, I had a daughter in the nineties. Her name is Gina Marie and she's 
30, and she's a handful, but I love her. 
Cynthia Miha (00:15:11): 
I'm a woman of domestic violence. I'm not ashamed to say it. Because this needs to be talked about. 
When you don't love yourself, you're attached to a parasite that doesn't love themself. And when 
people are used to telling you you're nobody or you'll never amount to nothing. The love that you get 
from that parasite, you think it's okay and it's not okay, to be told that you're nothing, you're garbage. 
You're just...you have AIDS. You're trash. That's not cool. I allowed this man to belittle me and to treat 
me like garbage. I allowed that because I didn't know any better. So through going to programs like the 
Women's Center and other programs like St. Anne Institute. I went to a few of them that I can't 
remember right now. They helped me. Women in power. Clients. I took in information. I listened. I 
learned. Once I got educated, I'm a graduate of the HIV Law Project. I am a graduate of the Montefiore 
Peer Education Institute. I am a graduate of Exponents. I am a graduate of a lot of programs. And why? 
Because Cynthia wanted to give back. I am a graduate of Sun River Health, that used to be PSI and Bright 
Point. And I've been here since 2011. People that walk in through this door, new clients, old clients, I'm 
always honest about my heart and how I feel. I'm always giving, and giving advice and giving resources 
and always sharing, sharing, sharing, sharing, never keeping anything and never holding anything for me. 
I'm always giving, giving, giving, giving. I don't know how to love me. I don't know how to do that. I know 
how to love everybody else, but I don't know how to love me. And I need to let people know that we're 
not just HIV. We're human. We did nothing wrong. And where before it used to be a death sentence, 
not anymore. You could live a normal life. As long as you do the right thing. Take your medication. Eat 
properly. Exercise and being a humanitarian. I think that's who I am. I think. I'm always giving the shirt 
off my back to anybody. I don't see color. I don't see gender. That's just not who my grandmother 
raised. But I get hurt all the time. All the time. So what do I do? I just keep on giving. Keep on giving. 
Keep on giving. And keep on giving. And the best way I know how is to be a Peer Navigator. I work for 
the PrEP program, and we help find people that are non-HIV and help them get on Descovy and Truvada, 
and educate them, and tell them that being promiscuous is not always the right thing. But if you're going 
to do it, at least be safe. I'm hardheaded. I'm stubborn. I like to color. I like to eat candy. I'm 61 years old 
and I'm like a little kid, man. My spirit is of a 25 year old. 
Elinor Levy (00:19:09): 
When's your birthday, Cynthia, if you don't mind.? 
Cynthia Miha (00:19:12): 
1960. 
Elinor Levy (00:19:16): 
I just turned 61 a couple weeks ago. So we're sisters in age. 
Cynthia Miha (00:19:21): 
Yes. I love the fact that I like life. I like to make people laugh. I like to give people encouragement. "Go 
back to school. Never give up, never give up hope." That's just who I am. 
Elinor Levy (00:19:37): 
You know what 61 gives us permission to do? Whatever the hell we want? That's good for our bodies. 
You know, eat dessert first. 
Cynthia Miha (00:19:50): 
I'm so honored to you guys to allow me to express so much pain that I've been carrying inside for so 
long. I know abandonment. I know abuse. I know rape. I know all these qualifications. I've carried and 
walked in all of them. And I could sit in a women's group and talk about all these topics. I could sit at a 
organization and talk about things that clients need when we go to programs, and programs that work 
for us. And I'm a client. I'm a peer. I'm an advocator. I'm a guest speaker. I'm a woman. There's so many 
things going on that if I can be just this much of help for the future, then I've done my job. 
Elinor Levy (00:20:44): 
Can you talk about how you came to be at Brightpoint and then Sun River Health? How did you start? 
Cynthia Miha (00:20:54): 
I started off when our Director, Ms. Elizabeth, was a director here. I had told her that I wanted to be 
something more than just a ____. I used to put the program on the wall, collect the folders. Things to 
that nature. Give out Metro Cards. I wanted to do more than that. So she sent me to Exponents and I 
took a training to be a recovery coach. She said "If you pass this, then I know you're serious." I passed it. 
So she said, "Then I could move you on to better and bigger things" And I moved on to take trainings 
with with HIV/AIDS Institute. My passion to help people comes from inside. Having someone tell you 
you have HIV and have no one near to support you, is a very big thing. I know that feeling and I want to 
be that voice. "I got you. It's gonna be all right. Look at me. 32 years later, I'm still standing. And I went 
through pneumonia, AGT, I'm a warrior. I've been out there in the front lines. I'm still here. So listen to 
your PCP doctor, do what you need to do, take your medication. You got this". I have to give back 
because I'm still here. There's a reason why I'm still here, to give back. And that's what we should all do, 
is give back. 
Elinor Levy (00:22:28): 
Can you talk to us a little bit about over the years, you know...Aaron is younger than you and I, so you 
and I, we remember a world before HIV. 
Cynthia Miha (00:22:43): 
You know, it was a world of death. People were dying everywhere. Half of the people that I knew from 
programs are all gone because the medications and complications besides the virus... 
Elinor Levy (00:22:59): 
We didn't know what it was. You know? 
Cynthia Miha (00:23:00): 
We didn't know what it was. When I had AZT it gave me a body rash so horrible. I took medication that 
tasted like gasoline. I took up to 15 pills a day. We were like guinea pigs. And all you saw was death, 
death, death, death, death. That's what it was. And it was horrible. 
Elinor Levy (00:23:25): 
And we know that it tragically started in the gay community, and then somewhat rapidly into the 
intravenous drug users and sex workers and blood transfusion. What is the face of AIDS in 2022? 
Because it doesn't look like...I don't think it looks like what it looked like to me. 
Cynthia Miha (00:23:55): 
HIV and AIDS doesn't discriminate. It could take anybody from an infant to the oldest of the oldest. As I 
see now, our generation of 55 and over are getting infected with HIV. Why? Because sex workers are 
going after people that are getting disability checks, older men that are alone and want company. Older 
women want company and it is spreading something horrible. Young adults are not thinking, "Oh, I don't 
need to put on a condom. I'll be alright. That won't happen to me." That's bullshit. It can happen to 
anybody. So HIV doesn't have a face. It'll take you and drop me where you stand. If you don't pay 
attention quick, fast, I'm in a hurry. I'm lucky. and I'm blessed that I take Symtuza, and it's helped me. It's 
helped me. And I'm still here and I'm undetectable for the last five years. 
Elinor Levy (00:24:56): 
Congratulations. 
Cynthia Miha (00:24:57): 
Thank you. Because of my medication. Once in a while, I'll get a little crazy. One thing, you can't miss, 
you can't take a holiday. You can't do what you want, but I'm not gonna lie to you. I've done it in the 
past." You know what? I don't feel like taking my meds today because I feel great" No, it doesn't work 
like that. You've got to take it every day of your life. As you brush your teeth everyday, you gotta take 
your pills everyday. And that's something that the message needs to get out. It's something that you 
don't play with, like high blood pressure medication. Today, I happen to have high blood pressure. I 
didn't take my meds for a couple of days. I told my doctor. So, I need to know that as I take my HIV 
meds, I need to take my high blood pressure medication. So it's been a rough life. I enjoy what I do. 
Being a Peer Mentor. I enjoy educating people. I enjoy talking about my experience. There's even been a 
point where I just wanted to die, because I had HIV AIDS. I didn't want to bathe. I didn't want to get out 
of the house. I didn't want to travel. I didn't want to do anything. I just wanted to die, because I was 
ashamed how people were treating me, "Oh don't eat behind her. She has HIV." "Don't use this room 
because she has HIV." "Don't go in the bathroom behind her because she'll infect the toilet." I was 
treated like garbage. Dentists wouldn't touch me. Doctors, they treated us like animals. I didn't want to 
live like that. So I just wanted to die. I didn't care about anything or anyone. I was hopeless. And it took a 
lot. It took a community of pioneers to tell me "That's not how we're going to live. We're not doing that 
today, Cynthia. Get up off your ass. Get in that shower and we're going to reeducate you. We're going to 
support you. And we're going to love you. And this is how this goes." 
Aaron Paige (00:27:00): 
And now, you are one of those individuals for others. I mean, you are that community for those that 
you're working with. 
Cynthia Miha (00:27:10): 
Yes. 
Elinor Levy (00:27:11): 
That's why you're still here. 
Cynthia Miha (00:27:13): 
Yes. I'm the voice of that woman that has been battered. I'm that voice of that drug user. I'm that voice 
of that woman that doesn't love to look at herself in the mirror. I'm that voice of the one that says, "You 
know what? I'm not worth living." I tried to commit suicide twice. I've taken pills. I didn't succeed. Once 
in California, I took sleeping medication. They caught me and pumped my stomach out. And another 
time here, when I was living in a furnished room, I took a bunch of, so I thought, aspirins. I took 72 of 
them. And all I got was a horrible headache, wound up going to the hospital. I don't think about suicide 
anymore, because there's no need to. There's so many people out there that love me, support me. And I 
don't need to do that anymore. I do suffer from depression. So I take my depression medication. I have 
good days. I have bad days. And I have okay days. But I'm still here. 
Elinor Levy (00:28:21): 
And it makes you... Because of all of your experience, none of your clients can bullshit you. They can try. 
They can tell you, "Well, I've done this and this.", and you can just say, "Well, hold on. So have I." 
Cynthia Miha (00:28:42): 
Yeah. And I always have good advice for people that are not ready. Some people are just not ready and 
it's okay. You have to be ready. You have to be ready. 
Aaron Paige (00:28:54): 
Cynthia, what is your day-to-day work, and what does it involve? Who are you meeting with? What are 
you talking to them about? How are you reaching them? 
Cynthia Miha (00:29:03): 
Well, as of now, because of the pandemic, we're at the office. There's not a lot of people. So what I do 
on my daily work, I do ECW ____, which those are the people that have come to the clinic, and we get a 
log, and we go through it. I look for the clients that have STIs and are undetectable. They don't have the 
virus. I circle them. And then they are candidates for the PrEP program. I call them, and I engage in 
asking them, are they interested in coming in and talking about Descovy and Truvada. When they ask, 
"What is that?" I go, "It's a medication to prevent HIV." If they're engaged, and then our supervisor, 
Michelle Jones, will do their intake. And then we get them with their providers. That's when they either 
say yes, no. And if they do, then they get the medication. I follow up every three months to call and 
make sure that they're taking their meds, they're doing their bloodwork, and they're doing what they're 
supposed to do to have a productive, happy life. That's what I do. You have clients that sometime you 
call them and they're a little rude. What I do, because I'm always happy. I would tell them, "You know 
what? Well, I'll call you back another day or next month. And you have a wonderful day." Once I tell 
them that they'll be like, "Oh wow, thank you" I go, "You're welcome." You're going to have days that 
you have people that are nasty, but I always find a way to catch them and tell them, "You know what? 
It's okay. Tomorrow's a better day than today. You have a great day." So that's what I do. And I enjoy 
doing what I do. I come back to Inwood. That's where I'm at now and I have old clients that tell me, 
"When are you coming back?" And I tell them, "I'm not, I have a part-time job. And I'm now a part-time 
staff member." And they're like, "Oh my God, you have earned it. Because you have given so much to us. 
We are truly happy for you. And it's nice to hear that. 
Elinor Levy (00:31:09): 
So your part-time job is the PrEP. 
Cynthia Miha (00:31:12): 
Yes, that's my part-time job. So I work through Sun River Health, and I'm part-time staff. I do about 20 
hours a week and I love it. But I never forget where I've come from. I will always re-appear. I will always 
be a client. I never forget that. I know where I started. I know where I started. And I'm always humble. I 
got a job, but I always treat my friends like my friends. I don't forget. Never forget where you come 
from. That's what keeps me humble. Never. Because sometimes people get positions and they forget 
where they come from. No, I don't forget. I don't forget. Never forget. It keeps you stable. It keeps you 
in line. You know what? I remember, I used to smoke crack. I remember I used to drink. I remember 
when my husband used to beat my ass. I remember. Yeah. Remember those things. Keep one in the 
back of your file. Because when you get certain clients, you know how to deal with them "Oh, that girl. I 
know that girl's getting hit. Let me see how I can work with her." "Oh, I know you're still getting high. I 
see it". So each individual, I have that skill that I can help them with. In my way. Not the way my 
supervisor would tell me. She'll tell me, "Okay, we gotta do this, this, this, this." But you have to find 
your own niche, your own way. How to deal with individuals. 
Aaron Paige (00:32:35): 
Do you find that your work as a peer goes beyond just health care, the health needs of the client? 
Cynthia Miha (00:32:48): 
How do I say it? I want to say it correctly. Being a humanitarian goes more further than just healthcare. 
It's caring about the individual as a person, not a chart number. That's how that goes. Oh, when I call, 
"How are you today? How was your weekend? Merry Christmas. How do you get..." Whatever's going 
on? I extend it. Not just, "Okay. I'm just calling to check. How are you doing?" No, it's more than that. It's 
more than that. You treat them like they're human. It's conversation. And it makes them feel like, 
"Damn, she's engaging. And this woman actually cares who the hell I am." That's how you do it. That 
wasn't given to me when I started out. I was treated like a piece of shit because I had HIV AIDS. Things 
have changed in 30 years. They sure have. We have fought, We have argued, and we have died for our 
rights. We have died. Many people have died. Humanitarians, fighters, have died. And the ones that are 
still standing, we're still fighting. And I'm one of those fighters. I have a long, long way to go, and I want 
my voice to be heard. I want it to be recognized that I am a warrior, and I have a lot, a lot more to do. 
And to give back to the community. 
Elinor Levy (00:34:14): 
You do. And thank God. Thank God there's yous. Thank God, there that came out very poorly. But thank 
God. 
Cynthia Miha (00:34:27): 
Why are you crying? Why? 
Cynthia Miha (00:34:30): 
Because you remind me of someone I miss. 
Cynthia Miha (00:34:35): 
Aww. 
Elinor Levy (00:34:36): 
You remind me of a woman I met 22 years ago, who was a drug addict and a prostitute and drank and 
smoked. One day, she told this story, that she was standing in the rain in a phone booth, which of course 
don't exist anymore. And she finally said, "You know, Jesus help me." When I met her in 1999, she had 
graduated from high school. Her children were grown. She worked for Habitat For Humanity. She was a 
homeowner. You just remind me of her, and the strength that she brought to other women and that you 
bring. I haven't thought about her in ages. I remember the struggle. I remember when AIDS first came 
out, and I remember the people I lost. And work that I did back then with Act Up. Every time the quilt 
came out, having to look and see if my friends had petals. Sometimes that was the only way I could find 
out if they were alive or dead. 
Cynthia Miha (00:36:05): 
Right. The biggest agency was Bronx AIDS services. We had the one downtown. I forgot the name of 
them. Oh, Jesus, Lord, I can't remember right now. The gay men's rights, what's the name of that? They 
helped also. There's a lot of communities and agencies now. It's about the funding and not about the 
care. I'm sorry to say that. They don't put what they used to give, the love, the concern, the humanity. 
It's not the same. It's about numbers and the money in the grants. It's not the same. It's not the same. 
It's not the same. But we have us that are here. The ones that have been there in the beginning. We are 
still here and we're just going to continue being us, and doing what we need to do to help the 
newcomers. And that's what I do. I help the newcomers. 
Aaron Paige (00:37:04): 
How do you meet the newcomers, the people that you're serving? We talked once before, and you were 
talking about going out there into the community, not just having people come into the space. 
Cynthia Miha (00:37:20): 
Right, doing outreach. So we do events, and we do outreach, and we set up a table, and people engage 
and they come over. And my most powerful ally is because I speak Spanish. So I engage with the Latin 
community, which is so taboo because they don't want hear anything about HIV. "Oh, no, not me." And 
"I don't want to wear condoms." And I explain to them, "No, this is what's going on in the real world. 
You need to wear condoms. This is what's going on. Just because you're not engaging in sex. You have a 
niece, a nephew, your grandson." And I engage. And that's when they're like, "Oh." So I hand them a 
pamphlet. "This is what's going on at the clinic, if you have a family member that's interested." So I use 
that second language as a tool to engage the Latin community, especially the older, 55 and over. So 
when we do outreach, I bring them in. I bring them in and I let them know. "You know, it's just not me. 
Okay. I'm not interested." You need to be interested, because HIV doesn't have a face, a gender ,or a 
race. So that's how I engage. Here at Brightpoint, we would have adult daycare, and we would have 
different groups and different people would come in, and we would share our stories, and share our 
knowledge, and share our resources. We would have newcomers come in. People that are like, wow, 
like up there. And by the time months have gone by, we would educate them or try to show them your 
worth. Now you could stay here for a lifetime, or you could learn, get what you need and move on. And 
that's what part of the system is. And so what I did, I was here from 2011, and I worked my way all the 
way to a job. I said it every time "I'm going to get a job, I'm going to get a job." And people would laugh, 
and look where I'm at now. I got a job. Because I was determined. And I happen to be good in school. I 
like school. I like to learn, so I would take notes. I would ask questions. I would know who to talk to. I 
became part of the CAB, of the Client's Advisory Board at Sun River Health. I would go to meetings. I 
would advocate for the Latin community. I would advocate for our Peers. I would go up there and fight 
for them. That's who Cynthia is. I'm that voice and I'm very loud. You're going hear me. Yes., I'm very 
loud. You're going to hear my mouth. Loud. Yes. 
Elinor Levy (00:40:01): 
In what ways has Descovy and the other one sort of changed things now that these two drugs that you 
could potentially take? 
Cynthia Miha (00:40:10): 
Well, I used to take Truvada. And taking those medications, what we're trying to aim is to stop the 
spread of HIV. And Biktarvy and all those other medications that are coming out are actually doing their 
job. The more people we get, the less the virus is spread. It's doing its job. We have a lot of people on 
Descovy and Truvada and they're doing well. The numbers are good. So we just have to make sure that 
they take their test every three months for HIV, meet with their providers, and do what they need to do 
to have a healthy, good life. But that also comes with mental illness, eating properly, and getting proper 
sleep. It's a package deal. It's just don't take your meditation. It's all in one. It all coincides together 
Elinor Levy (00:41:08): 
And they have to take it for the rest of their life? 
Cynthia Miha (00:41:11): 
Yes ma'am, yes. Yes. Yes you do. 
Aaron Paige (00:41:14): 
For those individuals who maybe are experiencing housing insecurity or food insecurity, do you find it to 
be your role to connect them, to help connect them to those services? 
Cynthia Miha (00:41:28): 
Well, in my role as a Peer Navigator, my part is to connect by phone and engage. What I don't know, I 
will ask my supervisor, and she will take it to the next level. And what she doesn't know, she'll ask the 
next person. So it's a community within a community. We have social workers. We have doctors. We 
have nurses. We have everything under one roof. So we pass it along. So it's a chain of command. My 
part is I pick up the phone and engage. The next person is to write down what they need. The next 
person is to make the appointment. So we all work as a unit to get what that client needs. So we don't 
do too well with homelessnesss. But I'm nosy. As I said, and excuse my expression. I will Google the bitch 
down until I find something. Excuse my expression. I will get on Google. I am the queen of Google. I will 
find shelters. I will find food pantries. That's what Cynthia does. And come back with a gaggle of 
information. Here you go. That's what I do. 
Elinor Levy (00:42:34): 
Because you can't keep up the medication if you're not stable. I mean, you can't. 
Cynthia Miha (00:42:39): 
Exactly, exactly, exactly. Exactly. So that's what I do. I Google everything. I get information. I give it to my 
boss. "Here you go. This is what I found. Free food, free clothes, this that, that." And she's like, "You're 
always full of resources." And I say, "That's what you do. That's just what technology is for, to use it." 
And what I don't know, I ask. So that's what I do. I give. You give and you pay forward. That's how you 
do it. That's how you do. 
Aaron Paige (00:43:07): 
Cynthia, in terms of the outreach itself, where do you do that? I mean, how do you choose the 
locations? How do you meet people where they are at? 
Speaker 2 (00:43:19): 
Our boss, Ms. Michelle, they have organizations that call her, or things pop up. They send her emails and 
she and her boss, they pick and choose what events they want to go to. We have one coming up in 
Harlem this Wednesday. We're going to engage. I already made condoms and packages. So when I go to 
the event in Harlem on Wednesday, my role is to engage as many people as I can and tell them "First, 
that Sun River Health has an excellent clinic. We have an excellent program for PrEP and PEP, because 
it's PrEP and PEP. Would you like to be interested, to get a checkup first, to make sure if you're HIV 
positive or not? Because you can't qualify. You have to be negative. Not have it at all, in order to qualify 
for the program. And if you don't have it, it's an excellent clinic to be in anyway." So that's what my goal 
is, to engage as many people as possible. 
Aaron Paige (00:44:28): 
You had mentioned even attending some Kiki balls, for example. 
Cynthia Miha (00:44:33): 
Yes, across the street from our job, it's called Destination Tomorrow, and they're an organization that 
deals with transgenders and young children, you know, bisexual and ABQRXQWXYZ. That's how I'm 
going to put it. And they give Kiki balls. And Kiki balls are where they do the dance. They're called balls. 
When they have events and I go and I love it because these young kids, oh my God, they put on such a 
show. Like I said, I'm a kid at heart and I'm going to go and dance too, but I know I can't, so I watch. The 
kids come and ask, "What is this for?" And I tell them "This medication is to stop HIV. And if you'd like, 
you could come retest it and we could take it for there." I'll take their name, and give them a gift. What 
do we have... buttons. We have a hand sanitizer. Right now, we just received water bottles. We receive 
fanny packs that says "Sun River Health". So as the clients come to the table and sign, we can give them 
a gift. We engage them to come back. And a business card. "If you're interested, this is my supervisor, or 
this is my phone number. Give me a call. We'll make an appointment and we'll take it from there." And 
the kids are... each one of them is unique, and I've always, always...I'm a little young adult, have always 
loved the gay community. Always, always. I don't know what it is. Maybe I was gay back in the day, or 
transgender back in the day, but I always gravitate to them. And each individual that I have met along 
the way, I always give them good advice. "Be who you are, be true to yourself. And don't treat people... 
Treat them the way you want be treated, with respect." And I have a pretty good fan club that love me 
for me. How I treat them with no animosity, with no judgment. You are who you are. You're going to be 
who you want to be. It is what it is. I don't treat people different. I see good in people. This is what my 
grandmother showed me, but you know, something that she forgot to say? People come with evil 
intent. People come with their own agenda. That's what she forgot to tell me. The works is not made 
with roses and smelling like perfume. She forgot to tell me that part. So I got hurt along the way. But 
with all that hurt, I still give love. Even if I don't love myself. That's the lesson she didn't show me. 
Elinor Levy (00:47:28): 
What happens when you come across a youth male, female, trans, who's not of legal age and they want 
help and their family is not interested? What can you do for a 16 year old? 
Cynthia Miha (00:47:52): 
As far as the program is concerned or on a personal basis? 
Elinor Levy (00:48:02): 
I'm asking what happens when a person underage comes to you at one of these events and relays to you 
that they are 15, 16, 17 years old. They're living... 
Cynthia Miha (00:48:16): 
I believe that they could start at 16. Yes. They could start at 16. 
Elinor Levy (00:48:20): 
Without their parents? 
Cynthia Miha (00:48:24): 
Yes. Yes they can. But you know something? I'm glad you asked me that, because my children both have 
a lot of friends that are young, have come from broken families. And do you know how many children I 
have now? Their friends all call me mom, because they say, "You are the lady that always had time to 
listen, always gave us a plate of food to eat, and always gave us good advice." So they call me mom. 
Always. "You always gave unconditionally, no matter what. What's going on with you?" And that's just 
who I am. And I have all these gaggle of kids that are adults now, with their kids. And they call me 
grandma, even if I'm not related to them. "This is the lady that helped me when I was going through my 
shit with my mom. This lady here told me to stay in school. This lady here opened her doors and let me 
sleep on her couch when I was running the streets." See what I mean by giving back? I give back in every 
aspect of life. Not just in the clinic. Even in my personal life. I had many young children sleep on my 
couch, asking nothing in return." "Just go to school, please, graduate, do what you're supposed to do, 
please." I think I've done pretty okay with that. Even if their parents don't say thank you, I know I did 
something good for a kid. 
Elinor Levy (00:49:44): 
Their child is still alive. That's something. 
Aaron Paige (00:49:47): 
Amen. Amen. 
Elinor Levy (00:49:50): 
That is certainly a thread that Aaron and I have found in every single interview we've done. There's not a 
single one of Peer, Promotora, immigrant farmworker, who has not stayed after hours. Put someone on 
their couch. Driven them places. Not a single one of you who hasn't gone beyond. I know Sun River 
Health has problems. Every organization problems. But for an organization to get the type of people 
who do this is pretty amazing. That it attracts this kind of person who... 
Cynthia Miha (00:50:40): 
You know what? It's not even the organization. I'm going to tell you the secret. It's word of mouth. It's 
people helping people. "Yo, I went to this program and I got help from so and so." So when you go to the 
program, you're looking "Oh, I heard about this lady named Cynthia. The tall lady with the glasses? I 
heard good things about her. Can I meet her?" It's word of mouth. I've had so many clients at Inwood, 
people that have come in and have gone and come back and go, "I'm looking for the tall lady with the 
glasses. The lady that was nice to me when I walked in the first time." Literally have told me that. They 
don't remember my name but they remember the tall lady with the glasses. That they remember. "Oh, 
Ms. Cynthia! Thank you for everything you've done for me. When I walked in, you made me feel safe. 
Intake, you made me feel comfortable." And they come back and say, "Thank you." That makes a 
difference. When you walk into an organization, and someone makes you feel welcome. It speaks 
volumes. 
Elinor Levy (00:51:45): 
People forget that the smallest kindness can change a person's day or change a person's life. It took me 
a long time to figure that out, but you never know what shit people are going through. When they are 
irritated with you, it's not about you. It's about something that's happening in their life. Because 
sometimes the hardest thing to do when something's happening in my life, is to turn around and be 
nice. 
Cynthia Miha (00:52:17): 
Yeah. And I think through my age, and learning, and experiencing, whatever's going on at home, I have 
to leave it outside. I have to leave it at the front door. When I come into this building or any building, I 
need to, it's not about Cynthia. It's about the client. It's about their needs and wants, not mine. I can cry 
and boohoo all I want, after I leave. But while I'm in here, I need to worry about them. That's what I've 
learned through the years, and I have excellent mentors too. Excellent. Yeah. Yeah. So what questions 
do you have? I hope I gave it my best shot. I was honest. 
Elinor Levy (00:53:05): 
You were wonderful. Yeah. 
Cynthia Miha (00:53:13): 
I hope that this helps somebody 20 years from now. I hope that if there's a woman, a man, or a young 
teenager that's lost, that's hurt, that needs to hear these things, I hope it works for them. And I do mean 
that from the bottom of my heart. I sincerely mean that. I think that I have met some incredible, 
incredible people along my way. I have met and lost good people also. But today is a blessing. And I 
don't know if you hear this a hundred times over guys, but thank you. You guys are humanitarians. 
Elinor Levy (00:53:57): 
Thank you. 
Cynthia Miha (00:53:57): 
You guys are awesome, and you're doing an excellent job. Thank you. 
Elinor Levy (00:54:02): 
Well, thank you. Aaron, do you have any more questions or are you... 
Aaron Paige (00:54:08): 
If you're comfortable talking a little bit more, Cynthia, and then we... I mean... 
Cynthia Miha (00:54:13): 
That's fine. That's fine. 
Aaron Paige (00:54:14): 
You know, we won't go all day because I know Elinor also has got a meeting at four. You've done so 
much for so many people. I'm wondering, if you might speak about a moment in your work where you 
saw the fruits of your labor with an individual; where you really impacted somebody's life. Could you 
bring us into that without using that individual's name, or that person's name? 
Cynthia Miha (00:54:52): 
Yeah, I have a story. I have a young lady that came a couple of years ago. It's been two years. They came 
from a homeless shelter. We would bring this... It was women. They came in. She was very loud. Very 
I'm here, notice me! Very angry. A lot going on. They had asked me and someone else to give our story. I 
went into the room and she wanted to be the center of attention. But once I started speaking, she got 
quiet. There was a lot going on with her. She had recently lost someone that she loved, and she was 
going through some stuff. So every day, I would talk to her and tell her, "You're gonna be alright. You're 
gonna be alright. Don't worry. You know, things happen for a reason in a season." She started to change 
little by little, joining our group, sitting at the table. We would talk. Whenever she needed somebody to 
talk to, we would chat or call on the phone. And there was a group of individual ladies at the table, they 
would support each other. And I was always talking to her. And this individual had started taking 
trainings at Exponents and doing what she was supposed to do. And in the midst, little by little, she 
graduated on Sun River Health. I was very proud of her, and she went on to do bigger and better things. 
And now she is a Peer Navigator for Exponents. When I went back to do cycle 168, 169, because I 
wanted to go back and do it again. When I said my speech, she got up and said, "This is the woman that 
changed my life forever. And I will always be grateful." That meant a lot to me, because she didn't have 
to do that. I don't talk about what I've done for her and what we talked about, because there's no need 
for that. I was just being Cynthia, being kind and just being me. But she always, always, anyone. she talks 
to acknowledges "This lady right here, she means something to me, because she helped me find myself, 
find my spirit, find my love for me, and encourage me to do wonderful things with my life." I'm very 
proud of her. Very proud of her, that I was able to share my life with her. So I'm grateful that I was here 
for her. 
Aaron Paige (00:57:37): 
You know, we have asked this question I think of most of the community health workers and the peers 
that we've been speaking with, and you have spoken to this, but what qualities do you see in yourself 
that you feel make you effective at the work that you do? 
Cynthia Miha (00:57:58): 
I believe I can answer that. I'm on time. I'm dependable. I'm reliable. I have passion in what I do, and I 
actually care about people. That's who I am. Give me a task, and it will be done at the end of the day. 
And if I don't know something, I ask questions. I don't pretend like I know everything. No challenge is 
too big for me. I'll figure it out. I actually enjoy getting up two days out of the week and coming into 
work, and engaging with the doctors, the nurses, the therapists, and just people in general. It feels good 
to come out of the house and see people, all of us doing one thing under one roof. It's to serve the 
community. And like I said, everybody has good days, bad days, but that you've got to leave at the door, 
or at the elevator. And when you open the door to Sun River Health, it's "Hi. How are you? Good 
morning. How can I help you?" And just make the rest of it. That's who I am. That's just who I am. And 
I'm not going to change for anybody or anything. I'm here for a reason in a season, whatever it is. Yeah. 
Aaron Paige (00:59:19): 
I'm glad we made time for that. Because that's so insightful in terms of what it takes and, who one 
needs to be to do this work. I also just want to say that I think the fact that your young client, who came 
to you at a time of need, her turning into a peer herself over time, that's a testament to what she saw in 
you and that relationship. And that was the model. The effective model that she experienced that 
transformed her life. I just want to acknowledge just how powerful... 
Cynthia Miha (01:00:00): 
I'm very proud of her too. I'm very proud of her. I'm very proud. And I know she'll do bigger and better 
things as time goes on. Very proud of her. And thank you for interviewing me, even though I'm having 
trouble with my mouth, but you understood me, and thank you. I really appreciate it. I really appreciate 
it. 
Elinor Levy (01:00:18): 
I loved that you said being on time is an important attribute, because a lot of these young ones don't 
understand the value of being on time. 
Cynthia Miha (01:00:30): 
No, I'm very, I'm very... I try never to call out. I'm pretty good with that. I'm always like, "I got to get to 
work. I got to get to work." Yeah. So if I call out that means I'm extremely sick. But besides that, yeah. 
Yeah. 
Aaron Paige (01:00:50): 
Thank you, Cynthia. I do hope that we have the opportunity to meet in person. I think Elinor and I are 
going to try once the... maybe towards the end of the project, or once it's over, but to visit the different 
sites and to get an opportunity to actually meet everybody. 
Elinor Levy (01:01:09): 
Yay! 
Aaron Paige (01:01:09): 
And we might even try, with everyone's permission, to arrange for a photographer to come, so we can 
get some really nice kind of portraits of all the peers and the community health workers. 
Cynthia Miha (01:01:19): 
That would be nice, yeah. I'm going be working on physical therapy starting next week with the bell's 
palsy. So hopefully, by then, my transition will be a little better, where my mouth is not so the way it is 
now. I feel comfortable talking to you guys the way I am now. So that means a lot to me. I usually hide 
my mouth. 
Elinor Levy (01:01:44): 
We understood everything. So, don't worry about that. It was very clear. I know it just feels horrible and 
uncomfortable to you. 
Cynthia Miha (01:01:53): 
Yeah, it does. It does. But you guys made me feel comfortable. So that means a lot. It does. 
Elinor Levy (01:01:59): 
Thank you. 
Cynthia Miha (01:02:00): 
And I wanted to wish you guys, if your moms are still here , happy Mother's Day to them too. Okay? 
Elinor Levy (01:02:05): 
And happy Mother's Day to you. 
Aaron Paige (01:02:07): 
To you as well. 
Cynthia Miha (01:02:07): 
Thank you. Thank you guys. 
Aaron Paige (01:02:10): 
Thank you, Cynthia. 
Elinor Levy (01:02:11): 
Take care.
