KING OF TRUMPS. 
Originally sung by Miss ET 
TA WEsiNEB, at the Eagle 
Theatre, with great success. 
" 
tou-jour gais," my motto, boys--
- Confound your doleful dumps 
I'm known upon the town, boys, 
As the jovial King of Trumps. 
I'm the favorite of all jolly dogs, 
They drag me out at night; 
For when they have got me with them 
Of course they know they're right. 
Trumps, trumps, trumps— 
Whenever you're down in the dumps, 
Come, come with me for a 
jolly spree, 
For I 
am King of Trumps. 
I've coffee and seltzer water boys, 
And look in at the Club; 
Shy in for chicken ha.zzard, boys, 
Or cut in for a 
rub ; 
But when Big Ben strikes ten, 
We pitch pasteboard and bones away; 
For ten o'clock at night, boys, 
Is our favorite time of day. 
Tramps, trumps, 40,, 
111. 
4 
The Theatres, now, are voted slow, 
I 
Music Hall's the thing. 
We Hansom off to the joliest, 
To hear the Comique's sing; 
We go in for no end of charm, 
No end of bright Moselle; 
But when the ballad is over boys, 
We sally out pell-mell. 
Trumps, trumps, Etc. 
We stand up, next, perhaps to dance, 
Or stand up in a 
row; 
But its all the same to us, you know, 
And we come out right somehow; 
I've visions next of Hay Markets--
I 
hope its but a 
dream— 
But we mingle with society 
That's not the cream of cream. 
Trumps, trumps, &c. 
Where next we go, I 
never know— 
It may be, perhaps. pell-mell ; 
Or, perhaps it is Saint Giles ; 
But the wine begins to tell; 
We see a 
double everything 
In every street we roam; 
AL-Al so at last we call a 
cab, 
And double back to home. 
Trumps, trumps, &e.

6GIVE A 
MAN A 
CHANCE. 
sung by Miss ELLA W ESNER, in G, with great success. 
I'm tired of offering advice, 
So will the subject change, 
And try a 
song of a 
different stamp; 
A 
title far from strange, 
• 
So while I 
strive to do my best, 
At me pray take a 
glance, 
Just let your sympathizing ears, 
And give a 
man a 
chance. 
CHouus. 
So always boys act fair and square, 
Accept what fortune grants ; 
And don't be over critical, 
But give a 
man a 
chance. 
Suppose a 
fellow can't stump up, 
Tweut.v shillings in the pound, 
Perhaps if breathing time be giv'n 
"The needful will be found. 
Say to him, " Well, I'll wait a 
bit ;" 
Think of this circumstance, 
And if you don't press over hard, 
You give a 
man a 
chance. 
So always boys, &c. 
My song. perhaps, may not please you, 
But to do so is my aim; 
To meet your kind approval, 
Is the summit of my fame. 
But if you do not quite agree 
With what I 
now advance, 
Just be as lenient as you can, 
And give a 
man a 
chance.

THE ROMAN FALL. 
As sung by MISS EJTA W ESNER. 
You've heard of the " Grecian Bend," 
And you know how the ladies appear; 
On the tips of their toes, with their high heel'd shoe,: 
It's amusing to watch them all. 
Without wishing to offend, 
I've invented a 
fashion, I'll swear— 
Will be followed out, too, as its something now, 
And I 
call it the " Roman Fall.' 
CHORUS, 
For if ladies still intend • 
To follow out the " Grecian Bend," 
Take notice, you meat all, 
The latest t13ing 's 
the " Roman Fall !" 
Head back, the chest well cut, 
A. wa:k between a 
shuflo and a 
crawl; 
The long, the short, he loan, the stout, 
Must try the " Roman Fall 1" 
Now you know as the ladies, of late, 
Have so very ridiculous grown ; 
Made themselves such guys, to appear in the eyes 
Of the gentlemen all in all. 
They will not be at all elate 
At the fashion we have of our own; 
For I 
quite intend to out- do the " Bend," 
By the beautiful " Roman Fall !" 
For if ladies, &e. 
A 
girl with the " Grocian Bend," 
Has a 
terribl3 trial to endure ; 
She mutt walk on her toes, and perhaps her nose 
May come bump up again4 a 
wall. 
1 # 
With the fashion that I 
recommend 
Our noses are safe I 
am sure ; 
For you'll find instead, it's the back of the head 
Will be hurt by the " Roman Fall." 
For if ladies, &c. 
Now I 
hope what I've said to night, 
Will sink in your memcries deep ; 
That you'll clearly see the necessity 
• Of adopting it, one and all; 
'Twill serve the dear ladies right, 
And prove that we are not asleep, 
If we boldly show there are none of us slow 
In producing the " Roman Fall 1" 
For if ladies, S3c. 
SPOB:EN. --When the ladies bend before us it shows they 
are inclined to stoop to our superiority, and such a 
feast of 
humbleness invites us to fall to. 
And the "Roman Fair 
shows we are Beaux to the back-bone. 
And by extending 
our manly breasts, " Chestify" ourselves in receiving the 
little benten forms on our lordly protuberances, and pi-
lowing their heads on those ribs from whence they sprung. 
Yes, gentlemen, we must show the dear girls that we can 
adopt fashions as ridiculous as their own. 
But really, tho 
ladies have become :1,o forward of late, that its not surpri-
sing that we should be a 
little backward. 
A good figure 
is always admired, and a 
fall in the back I 
consider espe-
cially graceful. 
The ladies always admi:e a 
fall in the 
back. 
And without conceit, I 
think I 
may say I've got it 
But don't be envious, don't be envious gen:I.:men ; only 
take my advice, and you'll be as fascinating as I 
am.

Is sung with great apnliti

States. by "e‘iii,,

My fellow sinners, lend, I 
pray, attention most intense ; 
In me you see a 
shining light of total abstinence. 
I've passed a 
very sinful life, got queer for nights and days; 
But praised be thanks, I 
now perceive the errors of my 
ways. 
CHORUS. 
And now I'm on the teetotal, total, total-turn-total, 
Yes, I'm on the teetotal, total, teetotal-tum-tay. 
In earliest childhood I 
commenced and with my A. B. C. 
Drank S. amiD. and prime L.L., took gin with my Pohea.

think. 
I've grown a 
brainless enemy to every kind of drink. 
SPOL_EN. — But when I 
signed the pledge suddenly, the 
delicious trembles came back ten hundred times worse, 
and I 
shook like a 
dish of jelly with the palsy. " Ease it 
off gently," says the Doctor ; 
den't be too rash. 
Take 
your noggin of gin at breakfast, and your Irish hot at 
lunch, and you'r bottle of Port at dinner, and you'r boiled 
bandy and cayenne at bed time.

tor, " be moderate." 
Of course medical science must be 
respected so here

bottle from his pocket 
and drinks.) 
For I'm now on the teetotal, &c. 
Your worst rogue makes your holiest saint, and that's the 
reason clear. 
I'm down upon the moderate man whom I 
catch sipping 
beer; 
I 
call him sundry awful names, an 1 
ur ze him to repel 
The deadiy poison ; it he won't, he'll sign his own death

indeed !— 
Still I'm on the teetotal, (te. 
My fellow duffers, let me beg the bottle you'll abjure. 
For all your ills cold water is the only certain cure.

And spirits bring on income tax, and measles too bring

THE HORSE GUARDS BLUE. 
Sung by the Champlon•Swell Impersonater, Miss ELLA Wasrinn, 
at the Theatre Condque, N. Y. 
BEHOLD one of her Majesty's 
Most noble sons of Mars, 
I'm one of those brave warriors, 
Who don't go to tab wars; 
Some say we're meant f,r 
ornament, 
Much more than we' e 
for use, 
And amongst the pretty servant girls, 
We play the very deuce, 
Amongst the little darlings,

Now as I 
walk through the Park, the little dears remark, 
"Did you evar! I 
nevar saw such a 
dear, did yon?" 
And many I 
hear say, as I 
stroll on my way, 
"That's my soldier I 
my soldier, my soldier in the Horse 
Guards Baloo! 4 
Along with common soldiers, now 
Of course we never mix, 
They are ever so much below us, 
When we stand six feet six; 
Thom fella s 
often have to slava,

And we go on Parade, 
While we are being admired by 
Some spooney servant maid. 
While we are doing the ' lardy dar,' 
In the company of an enamored domestic. 
SPOKEN. — In the way of spooning—" we are there! " 
Now as I 
walk, etc. 
Oh yes the girls surround us, 
Like bees aronnd the honey, 
Of course we're sure to steal their hearts, 
And we sometimes borrow their money, 
The Bobbies had it their way once, 
But ever since " the strike," 
The servant girls have turned them up, 
And we do as we like. 
All they get now's " Cold Shoulder," 
Whilst we have the run of the larder. 
SrosEN,—And when in the vicinity of the larder, 
thAret " 
Now as I 
walk, etc. 
We're good at a 
draught of beer, 
We can use a

We have a

Whilst other fellas walk; 
And when we're in full nniform,

For such a

Cheerfully pay their taxes ?

Now as I

For beins; dem fine fellas, 
Of course we're all well paid, 
And when a. war breaks out, yon know, 
We neves feel afraid!

At glorious wars Theatre, 
Our forte it is to capture learts, 
Beside a

THERE'S DANGER ON THE LINE. 
• As sung with great success in London, England, 
By Miss ELLS Wrsssms. 
If we'd but look ahead, in journeying through life, 
What accidents by flood and field, 'twouid save us in the 
strife ; 
The Railway has its signal lights, and so in life have we, 
They only want attention, and no danger there would be. 
CHORUS. 
For the white light, all right, go ahead in safety, 
The green lights seen right, will caution 1.13 in time ; 
But the red light., shown bright, brings us up right hasty, 
For when they show the red we know there's danger on the 
line. 
For instance, look at courtship now, a 
road you'd think 
well known; 
The warnings placed , along this line, are pretty plainly 
shown; 
• 
is 
But folks rush past the junction, and with blindness to 
their fate s 
Ne'er stopping till they're past the points, and then of 
course too late. 
For the white light, &T. 
For matrimonial signals, then, we hav'nt far to gaze, 
The warnings are in plenty shown and strike us with amaze, 
The safety light along this ' ranch, I'm sorry seldom shows. 
Then look well to your coupling, boys, ere each the jour-
ney goes. 
For the white light, &c. 
Then push along through life my boys, but heed well what 
I 
say; 
Don't pass or snub the cautions, that you meet with by the 
way ; 
And if you'd safely reach the end, just keep yourself awake, 
And when you find there's something wrong, then quickly 
ply the break. 
For the white light, &o.

Price 10 Cents, 
My love i3 the belle of the Avenue, 
She walks u? and down ev'ry day; 
And charms 
y 
one as she passes by, 
So beAutiful, graceful and gay; 
The swells when they see her, go crazy; 
And silently wish they were free 
To walk by her side, but they are denied, 
For she will have no one but me. ( Oh! 
CHOEUS. 
She is the belle of the Avenue, 
Graceful and bright, full of fairy light., 
Sweet and enchanting with eyes of blue, - 
Beam•ng with love and glee; 
She is the star of society. 
Pride of the ball with her fairy form. 
Joy and delight of her home so bright, 
And dearer than life to me. 
Sometimes, when it's fine in the afternoon. 
Her ma sends her out for a 
walk; 
"Now, darling." she'll say, " don't be long away, 
Don't stand with the young men to talk ;" 
" 
0, ma!" sho r3plics, • do not fear me— 
You know mach a 
thing cannot be ;" 
Then smiling she goes in all her nice clothes, 
And waits on the corner for me. ( Ha ! !) 
She is the belle, etc. 
We 
walk and we talk of the latest balls, 
And view all the styles of the day ; 
And when she must leave, oh I 
you can't conceive 
How much I 
would wish her to stay; 
But she will return on the morrow, 
That is, if mamma will agree; 
And while we're apart, I 
know in my heart, 
She's all the time wishing for me. (Ah!) 
She is the belle, et,

OUT IN TRE GREEN FIELDS, 
Sung by Miss ELLA W ESSER, America's Artistic Favorites 
A 
country lad am I, 
A 
rustic bred and born, 
The birds do sing, and so do I, 
And rise at early morn; 
To reap and mow, to till and sow, 
The land with plough and team, 
there's nought can beat a 
country life, 
Out in the fields so green. 
SPOKEN.—Ah, I 
be a 
happy lad, morning, noon and night, 
rain or shine, blow or snow, it's all the same to I, while— 
Cnonns. 
Out in the green fields, so happy and gay, 
Out in the green fields, a 
raking of the hay, 
Out in the green fields, I 
pass my time away, 
And like a 
lark I 
whistle in the morning. 
If corn be ripe, why then we reap, 
And swing the threshing flail, 
And when comes round the harvest home, 
We drink our home-brew'd ale; 
With sunshine bright, our hearts are light, 
The golden ears we glean, 
And merry make, with ale and cake, 
Out in the fields so green. 
SPOKEN.—Ah, harvest-home be the time for country lads to 
enjoy themselves, what with eating and drinking, and dancing 
with the lasses, we have a 
rare merry making— 
Out in the green fields, etc. 
Aye—doant I 
love a 
noice young lass, 
The fairest of the fair, 
She's round and plump, can ride, and jump 
A-fence, on th' old brown mare; 
Her eyes are bright, her step is light, 
• 
As graceful as a 
Queen, 
And doaiat she love a 
dance wi' I, 
Out in the fields so green. 
Out in the green fields, etc. 
Some like the fashions of the town, 
The ga.ities of Court, 
Give I 
the chase, the hurdle race, 
And ev'ry country sport; 
I 
do not care, for gm, and glare, 
The gayest sight e'er seen, 
I 
like the open sunlight best, 
Out in the fields so green. 
Out in the green fields, etc.

She told me as we wallictl aiuL 
" 
That her name was Mary Bell, 
And said, besides, 
she knew my Ma, 
And hoped she was quite well," 
But when she said, " your name is Brawn, 
And you live near Pamrapo, (N. J.) 
[ 
thought I'd picked up with a 
witch, 
Or else how could she know. 
As 1 
stroll'd, &e. 
As I 
Strolled Along the East River, 
As sung by Miss ELLA W ESNER. 
One Saturday, just for a 
change, 
I 
thought I'd take a 
walk, 
Along the East River, 
Now cf New York all the talk, 
When a 
pretty girl accosted me, 
" 
Oh pardon me, I 
pray.. 
But I 
want to go to Brooklyn Bridge, 
Please Sir, which is the way?" 
CTIORTJS. 
As I 
stroll'd along the East River, 
Wasn't it a 
jolly spree ; 
As I 
stroll'd along the East River, 
This pretty, pretty girl enchanted me. 
On saying this she smiled a 
bit 
And gave a 
quiet '• hem ;" 
For a 
second I 
was taken back, 
For she was a 
perfect gem ; 
But I 
replied, and instantly? 
‘• It wasn't far away, 
And by her leave. I'd show her there 
Without the least delay. 
As I 
stroll'cl, &c. 
I 
proffered and she took my arm, 
Which I 
thought would be refused, 
'" I'll have your Gal," the urchins cried, 
At which I 
felt amused ; 
For she really was a 
sort of girls 
You don't meet. every day ; 
he seemed to cast a 
spell on me 
r,onlcl not throw away. 
AS 
1 
Atroird, kr" 
I 
taxed my memory as to where 
I'd seen ner face before, 
But was aroused—as old St, John 
Chimed out the In.ur of four; 
Said she, •‘ oh laws ! I 
must be off 
For I'm ten minutes late ; 
Take this address and call on me, 
To-morrow night at eight." 
As I 
stroll'd, &e. 
Now to cut my little story short, 
Also my hopes and joys, 
I 
called and found she was a 
wife--
With two bonny girls and boys; 
And her husband was a 
lighterman, 
Upon the Noeth and East River by names ; 
For once, done brown, was Brown, by one 
Of nature's purest gems. 
Cnoaus. 
As I 
stroll'd along the East River, 
Wasn't it a 
jolly, jolly spree 
As I 
stroll'd along the East River, 
This pretty, pretty girl enchanted me. 
Down by the Old Mill Stream. 
Sung with great applause at the Howard Athenum. 
Boston, Mass., by Miss ELLA NVESNER. 
You must know that my Uncle is a 
farmer, 
Beeps a 
large farm in the West; 
While staying there I 
met a 
little charmer, 
And many's a 
time I 
caressed 
That girl so fair, with nut brown hair— 
Her equal ne'el was seen; 
And where I 
met this charming little pet, 
Was down by the old mill stream. 
CHORUS. 
Down by the old mill stream, 
There man happy hours I've seen; 
Strolling day by day, we passed-the time away, 
Down by the old mill stream. 
Her father was the owner of a 
dairy, 
Her brother worked the plow; 
And while I 
used to roam with little Mary, 
Her mother would milk the cow ; 
But her father said, " We should not wed," 
Which I 
thought rather mean; 
[life, 
As she could not be my wife, she said " She'd end her 
By drowning in Cho old mill stream." 
Down by, &a. 
27 
Now the old man laughed at his daughter, 
Saying, " I 
don't believe a 
word that you say, 
But when he saw her struggling in the water, 
He exclaimed, " Do save her, pray?" 
But it was too late, she Lad met her fate; 
Oh ! 
what a 
terrible scene ! 
The old man cried, as the neighbors tried 
To pull her out of the stream, 
Down by, &c. 
At last they got her out of the water, 
And some of the neighbors said, 
"Oh! Brown, you've been the ruin of your daughter, 
For the girl is really dead !" 
He tore his hair, gave ;way to dispair, 
Ran away, never more was seen; 
And now I'm told the dairy is sold, 
.ihat stood by the old mill stream. 
CHORUS. 
Down by the old mill stream, 
There many hours I've seen ; 
Strolling day by day, we passed the time away, 
Down by the old mill stream.

2 I 
went to the village school, 
And I 
proved so uncommon quick, 
That I 
galloped all through my geography, 
And I 
skipped my arithmetic. 
And my writing was " up and down," 
In a 
new and original style, 
And I 
jumped clean over the globes, I 
did, 
I 
was so volatile. 
I 
was so volatile, I 
was so volatile, 
E'en the Rule of Three was naught to me, 
I 
was so volatile.

Then didn't I

I 
AM SO VOLATILE. Oonoluded. 
Through this infirmity. 
For as soon as Mary Ann 
Had inveigled me with her smile, 
I 
was " off' again to Betsy Jane, 
I 
was so volatile,. 
I 
was so volatile, I 
was so volatile, 
I 
never could stop the question to pop, 
I 
was so volatile. 
4 
Then I 
joined the Volunteers, 
And I 
raced the corps for a 
wager; 
But I 
couldn't keep still at the weekly drill, 
In spite of the S_rgeaut Major. 
And it ever I'm called to face 
The foe in rank and file, 
I 
very much tear I 
shan't be " near," 
I 
am so volatile. 
I 
am so volatile, I 
am so volatile, 
I 
fear I 
might be " out of sight," 
I 
am so volatile. 
5 
I 
got more active still 
In the course of my career, 
For my Uncle Bill left me in his will 
Ten thousand pminds a 
year. 
That my poor relations grieve 
And despair, there's no denial, 
For I 
hear them cry, He never will die, 
He is so.vola!ile. 
Yes, I 
am so volatile, oh. I 
am so volatile, 
They fume and fret, but nothing they'll get 
While I'm so volatile. 
(In an old man's voice.) 
6 
But now I'm getting old, 
My hair is thin and grey; 
And my voice is so weak, I 
can 'hardly speak, 
And I've rheumatiz they say. 
But as for my blessed limbs 
They're just as juvenile, 
For they riggle and riot, and won't keep quiet, 
They are so volatile. 
I 
am so volatile. I 
am so volatile, 
Tho' I'm getting old, yet still I'm told, 
I'm just as volatile.

Sung 
ON THE PARADE. 
with great success at the Eagle Theatre, N. Y., 
By Miss ELLA W ESNER. 
When New York is dull, 
And all folks out of town, 
To Long Branch or Saratoga, 
Of course I 
inn down; 
In proper swell hours. 
You'll ee me arrayed, 
Doing a 
gentle crawl, 
On the Parade. 
Cnonus. 
On the Parade—on the Parade, 
I "do" the Parade. midst the beauties ar,:ayec:t, 
On the Parade, yaas, on the Parade, 
You may have all the town, but give me the 
Parade. 
Now some like Jettys, 
And some like the Piers, 
Infested by nurse-maids, 
And infants—" sweet dears ;" 
And some climb the heights, 
But as I 
am afraid 
Of too much exertion, 
I 
keep the Parade. 
SPOKEN .—If a 
fella goes up a 
hill, he has to come down 
again some time or other. 
If a 
fella does the Beach it's all 
" 
now for rowing„" or " now for sailing," fresh baked 
shrimps," and "fresh boiled oysters," and such like con-
founded bores, so I 
keep— 
On the Parade, &
A. 
Ic 
Now some like the sands, 
Some rude fellas there be. 
Who quiz the fair charmers 
Who bathe in the sea. 
Some " go in" for sailing, 
But of that I'm afraid; 
I 
feel so much safer 
When on the Parade. 
SPOREN. --A " sail in a 
Pleasure boat"—PLEASURE, oh! 
excuse me—when a 
fella's on shore he knows where he is— 
but when a 
fella's in a 
Pleasure (?) boat he don't know where 
he is—end feels as if he did'nt care where he went to—so I 
feel more '• at home"— 
On the Parade; &c, 
'Tis upon the Parade, 
When the sun's going down, 
One meets with the fairest 
Elite of the town. 
There's one charmer I'd " pop" to, 
But feel most afraid— 
She's the fairest and richest 
Upon the Parade. 
SPCZEN.—Beautiful creature—daughter of a 
Wall stree.
,. 
'banker—handsome girl—with an ugly old Governor—the 
old briar has a 
Gambooge complexion and a 
voice like a 
cracked Trombone—does the Bath chair business.

live and

THE GYMNASTIC WIFE, 
Sting with Great AppPause by Miss Etta W ESNES. 
SOME folks think woman ought to be, 
Atliletic—museular—  strong— 
Alas! I 
used to think so too, 
When I 
c 
urted Lucinda Long; 
When a 
mere girl, she ihen could do 
Over six good miles an hour, 
And in the feats of treno-tli, 
She' .1 most remarkable p . wer. 
SPOEEN.—Sometimes I 
wish Miss Long had remained Miss 
Long much longer for— 
CHORUS. 
My wife's so strong, and all day long, 
She frightens me out of my life, 
Whatever you do, oh! whatever you do, 
Don't have a 
Gymnastic Wife. 
I 
married sweet Lucinda Long, 
And blessed the lucky catch, 
But soon found out, she was co strong, 
I 
was not near her match; 
For at our weddin- breakfast, oh! 
She gave the guests a 
treat, 
By seizing me by the hair of my head, 
And lifting me off my fe t. 
For my wife's so strong, eta, 
85 
Instead of walking down the stairs, 
She clears the flight at a 
bound, 
Catch hold of me by the tail of in 
coat, 
And swing me round and round; 
She throws half hundred veights about. 
And twirls the Indian club. 
Or balances, two chairs and the cat, 
On top of the washing tub. 
Sk KEN.—And frequently winds up her performance by 
throwing an astounding somersault from the ‘vattr-butt on to 
the dust-bin— 
For my wife's so strong, etc. 
She does the dumb-. . ells twice a 
day, 
(A terrible weight they are,) 
In the garden she's fixed a 
high trapeze, 
And a 
Horizontal-bar, 
And there she Jports her lovely form, 
To the neighbors who come and stare, 
To see -
1".!c wife— the pride of my life, 
Going round and round in the air. 
SPOKEN.—Or practising the somewhat difficult feat of hang 
Mg by her eye- brows, if I 
dare to remonstrate with her, she 
threatens to throw me into the next street, says she's certain 
she could do it, " once in three times," horror! I 
believe she 
could too—for— 
My wife's so strong, etc.

spoke to her, she was not vexed, 
I 
lingered by her side, 
I 
thought—has she a 
father, now, 
Or worse---is she a 
bride; 
Beneath her dress a 
natty boot 
Forth peeping I 
could see, 
With such a 
dainty foot, I 
mused 
What must her ancles be.—Cno. 
3 
She stood and leaned against the rails, 
The naughty wind it blew, 
And showed her pretty aneles, but 
Of course she never knew; 
She heed.d not, why should she care, 
No harm was meant to be, 
And then I 
thought, she little knew 
Her ancles I 
could see. — Ciro. 
4 
We chatted till ftie moon came up, 
Across the wide sea foam, 
And then I 
offered her my arm 
And saw her to her home; 
For many months I 
courted her 
Our love was sweet to see, 
And every day at five o'clock 
I'd call and have my tea.—Cno, 
5 I 
need not say. she is my wife, 
For one fine afternoon, 
I 
married her and rushed abroad 
To spend the honeymoon; 
She is the one I 
dearly prize 
All other gifts above, 
For days and weeks and months go by, 
And still we dearly love.—Cno. 
• 
6 
I'd recommend all single men 
At once to take a 
wife, 
For I 
believe there's nothing half 
So sweet as married life; 
When tied from business you return, 
Refreshed by your wife's charms, 
Your weary feeling is dispelled, 
You clasp her in your arms,—Co,

THE GAY MASQUERADE. 
Sung by ELLA WESNER. 
SOME like garden parties, some like flower shows, 
For doing some spooning, just " under the rose," 
Some are partial to concerts, or lectures so staid, 
But my weakness, I 
fear, is the gay masquerade. 
CHORUS. 
Pm awfully fond of the gay masquerade, 
The gay masquerade, the bright masquerade, 
With sweet pretty darlings in costume arrayed, 
The gay masquerade for me. 
Some dances are like Quakers' meetings in style, 
So " starchy," and formal, one scarce sees a 
smile; 
But to do as one likes without feeling afraid, 
By Jove the right place is the gay masquerade. 
CHORUS. 
I'm awfully fond of the gay masquerade, 
The gay masquerade, the dear masquerade, 
With sweet " toot sic wootsies" so sweetly arrayed, 
The gay masquerade for me. 
To say most daring things, ' tis the easiest:task, 
To eome elegant creature whilst wearing a mask ; 
..0h the tales I 
have told, and the vows I 
have made— 
There's no place for ftirtitig like the gay naasqueradt) 
45 
CHORUS. 
I'm awfully fond of the gay masquerade, 
The gay masquerade, the bright masquerade, 
With dear " popsy wopsies," so gaily arrayed. 
The gay masquerade for me, 
Each lady that's masked, for " a 
beauty," don't take 
If you do then, " that's where you will make a 
mistake," 
Some darling old spinsters you'll oft find arrayed, 
Who are fishing for flats at the gay masquerade, 
14Porrs.—I generally go as " Romeo," and naturally look 
out for my Juliet; my last " Juliet," wag more fit for the 
part of " Nurse"—fifty if she was an hour, and when she un-

STROLLING. ON THE SANDS. 
As sung by EDDY NORWOOD. 
OF course we all know Ramsgate well, 
That spot to thousands deal, 
Where dashing belles and heavy swells, 
Assemble ey'ry year: 
Some like to roam along the Pier, 
And view what that commands, 
But my delight from morn till night, 
Is strolling on the sands. 
CHORUS. 
Strolling on the sands, strolling on the sands, 
Watching all the bathers dip, list'ning to the band, 
Strolling on the sands, strolling on the sands, 
In cool or heat there's nought to beat, a 
stroll upon the sands. 
I'll ne'er forget last summer-time, 
I 
spent a 
fortnight there, 
And made the sweet acquaintance of 
A 
lovely lady fair 
She'd gone to bathe at Dumpton Gap, 
But, oh! die naughty queen, 
For once she tlicught she'd do without 
That vile bathing machine. 
Strolling, &c. 
She placed har clothes upon the beack 
And then in the water played, 
But when she tried to come on shore, 
Ohl wasn't she dismayed; 
The tide had turn'd, and all her cloth% 
Were floating out to sea, 
She'd nothing but her bathing dress— 
In what a 
plight to be. 
Strolling Sys, 
I 
fetch'd her mother to her aid, 
And sa.vecLall further strife, 
The maiden paid, 
this great event 
I'll think of all my Le." 
We soon became the best of friends 
For all enjoy'd the run; 
We're lovers now—and soon we two 
Are going to be ono. 
Strolling, &c.

THE SWELL OF THE DAY. 
Words and Music by J. P. SKELLY, 
Sung with great success, by Miss ALICIA JOURDAN. 
I 
am a 
swell of the day—as you see— 
All other swells are but models of me ; 
You must have heard of the name which I 
bear, 
Surely you must, for I'm known everywhere ; 
Girls are enchanted when I 
ana in view, 
Gents are bewildered, and gaze at inc too ; 
Some criticise me and stare, while they say, 
" 
Oh, ain't he nobb3.-, that swell of the day !" 
CHORUS. 
I 
am the swell of the .tlay— 
That's what the people all say ; 
Go where I 
will, they say to me still, 
He's a 
genuine swell of the day. 
Now I 
confess I'm a 
little low down; 
How can I 
help it, when all thro' the town, 
V'People are praying for times to improve ? 
Still I'm contented and keep on the move— 
Why should I 
grumble when care I 
have none ? 
All my delight is in fashion an fun: 
Friends crowd around me, and wine makes us gay, 
Then they all flatter the swell of the day. 
I 
am the swnl, & c. 
I 
am accomplished and very refined ; 
Once I 
was rich, but my purse has declined ; 
Love is a 
stranger, as yet. to my heart, 
But from the ladies I 
ne'Er can depart, 
They are the cause of my joy and despair ; 
None can resist them, so charming and fair; 
Some spooney fellows they drive to dismay, 
But they all cling to the swell of the day. 
I 
am the swell, &A

THE BELLE OF THE BALL 
Assung by the Foy SISTERS.

MUSIC 
to be had of G. 1). ltussfmn et co. 
TO a 
ball I 
was one night invited, 
And being so fond of the dance, 
At the prospect I 
felt quite delighted, 
And eagerly jumped at the chance; 
There were swells looking out for the belles, 
And belles were looking for beaux, 
But a '. pal" introduced me to one, 
Whom—thought far out-rivalled the rose. 
• 
SecanS.—My friend introduced me to her, saying: " Charlie 
my boy, You're lucky, for—" 
CHORUS, 
This is the belle of the ball, dear boy, 
This is the bell; of the ball, dear boy. 
This is the best or them all, clear.loy, 
She is the belle of the ball. 
The envy of all the fair dancers, 
She had such a 
fairy-like grace, 
But just in the midst of the lancers, 
The lady turned black in the face; 
She gurgled, she gasped, and she glared, 
And seized hold of the tails of my coat, 
Alas the top teeth of my partner, 
Had slipped down her beautiful throat. 
P,ox.—Well, there is nothing so awfully detrimental in 
a.oe tooth or two, so I 
still thought that 
'Pais is the belle of the ball, dear boy, et", 
53 
She retired, ana when she'a recovered, 
In a 
quadrille I 
next took her hand, 
When a 
look in her eyes f 
disCovered, 
Which somehow I 
could not understand: 
Her eyes were Ps straight as a 
Venus, 
When I 
gazed. at hena iondly before, 
But no 
one eye looked up at the ceiling, 
And the other o3ked down on the floor. 
SPOREN.—Most extraordinary appearance! she evithfettly 
had a. glass eye. 
Some of my friends whispered, " I 
ri.cy, 
Charlie," 
" iou'le got the belle of the ball, (- ie. 
How the ladies they giggled and tittered, 
Of cource you may eas:ly guess, 
Though my 
fie.,ings were sadly embittered, 
I 
would not leave a 
girl in dis:ress; 
So we :madly mslied into a 
wa:tz, 
When she ntumbled o'er some fellow's leg, 
When off came her hair, twos (di false, 
And her head was as bald as an egg.

00MING HOME FROM THE BALL. 
Written and Composed by Josarn P. SKr:1.LT. 
Arranzed ty R. sTEIRL'r. 
THERE 13 no place so gay as the ball-room, 
Whet, we're dancing In dreamy delight, 
When the cares of the day never L•rt...,t, us, 
In the flush cf the beautiful night, 
But the dawn puts an end to our glory, 
And the pleasure we dearly adore, 
We must part from the scene so enchanting, 
And go home ' Joking sleepy and sore, 
• SPOIMN.—Yes, we r.1
,1 know there is nothing more delightfai 
than to go to a 
ball, and dance all night with a 
pretty girl, and 
eat expensive suppers, and flirt a 
I:ttle in a 
qt '; corner, and 
all that you know; but when reflecting on it tha next day, 030 
(itn't help but think, 
C1101/tTS. 
Oh it's all very well to be waltzing, 
And the pleasure we love to recall,' 
But you know how we feel in the morning, 
Coming home, coming home from the hal 
There the ladies are rivals of Venus, 
And their smiles all around us bestow, 
v'ry face wears a 
mantle of gladness, 
There 1s wele(me where ever we pi 
ts, 
55 
But when morning comet oound we are weary, 
And we growl at the pain in our heads, 
And we thint we were foolish for dancing, 
Wnen we should have been home in our beds. 
SPOKEN.—That 13 just how it Is. 
It's all very fine while it 
lasts, but we have to pay for i 
in the end. 
One will say, " Oh, 
my, I 
at so sleepy." 
Some body else will yawn out very loud, 
"Dear me, I 
wish I 
was home." 
Another will complain of 
being chilly,and so on. 
And when we contemplate al this we 
naturafl). say to ourselves, 
Oh it's all very well to be waltzing, etc. 
All around us the music is floating, 
Light and gly as the bird's happy song, 
And we sigh when the last note is over, 
Tho' we know we've been dancing too long; 
We are lost in the gladness around us, 
And (re heed not the hours as they fly, 
Till the light peeping in thro' the window, 
Makes us all bid each other good-bye. 
SPOKEN.—Yes, we must all say good-bye at last, while we 
eytnpathize with each other in our misery; an lg-o 
home shiver-
ing in the morning air. 
On the way we all join together and 
give vent to our feelings thus— 
Ca it's all qery well to go waltzing, etc.

Well, with lots of persuasion and coaxing and.fuss, 
The woi-st job I've had in my life: 
I

That she said she would be my wife. 
We drove to the church, when oh

She would have the door left ajar; 
When the clergyman said, " Will you wed?" she shrieked out'

At last we were married; oh, my, what a

To the continent then off we went, 
And I 
am happy to say she her nervousness lost 
When the honeymoon cosy we'd spent. 
And now she's so different to what she once was, 
We're happy by night and by day; 
her marriage she says she will never regret, 
And no more do I

When courting time with us begins, 
And love is in its prime, 
The only fellow for making love, 
Is he who drinks his wine. 
You never tind him bdshful, 
The wine fills him with life, 
He don't speak unheard, but out with the word, 
Will you be mine own darling wile? 
He don't speak unheard, but out with the word, 
Will you be mine own darling wile? 
CHO :— For Louis Renouf s 
the wine for me, Ate. 
3. 
And when old age creeps on the scene, 
Our hair is turning grey, 
Louis Renouf fills us with life, 
And makes us young as May. 
Then happy's the man that is married, 
To the girl he's made his wife, 
The horse he drives, the wine he drinks, 
Then he's led a 
jolly good life, 
The horse he drives, the wine he drinks, 
For he's led a 
jolly good life. 
Clio:— For Louis Renoufs the wine for me, 41:e. 
AWFULLY CLEVER,. 
As sung by Miss Jennie Hughes, 
I've a 
fellah who does'nt like bothah, 
All trouble to him is a 
bore, 
lie's an income left him by his mothaw, 
What on earth could a 
fellah want more ; 
His favorite sport's killing time, 
his aim's to do nothing at all, 
While some in this world run and climb, 
lie takes the trip easy and crawls. 
ClIORUS. 
For they tell him he's awfully clevah; 
Oh, so clevah, deuced clevah, 
They say that they nevah, no nevah, 
Met a 
fellah, so clevah before. 
Some fellah s 
go in for the Army'? 
And some fellahs go in for trade, 
But he hasn't such bores to alarm him, 
his fortune was already made. 
And some fellahs go in for brain, 
And scribble to earn an honest penny, 
Those fellahs deserve all their gains, 
As for brains he could do without any. 
in the park 1
,e 
is often seen driving, 
He thinks he's Alexis, the duke, 
Whenever he goes in for billiards, 
He thinks he's a 
hard one to fluke. 
Some times at an evening party, 
To keep us alive in he'll peep, 
Whenever we ask him to sing, 
We are certain to fall fast asleep, 
CHO 
GLITTER, 
As sung by Miss ELLA. Wnsxma. 
• 
They're not all gems that glitter, no! 
Attractive though they seem, 
For tinsel has a 
spurious glow, 
A 
bright but transient gleam ; 
The thoughtless oft era caught by this, 
And most men may be sold; 
Be careful that you don't get dross, 
Instead of shining gold. 
Cnonus, 
Glitter and glare may make people stare, 
But howe'er dazzling bright it may be. 
Glitter and gloss are nothing but dross ; 
Pure.gold, pure gold, the metal for me. 
Be ye as chaste, as pure as snow, 
You'll not escape the touch 
Of slander's tongue—be guarded—and 
It v,-7.11 not harm you much. 
Be upright, just, and always fair, 
Each debt of kindneas pay ; 
Let deeds, not words, rofiect your worth, 
And bear the light of day. 
Glitter and glare, &c. 
Pure gold with sonic is very scarce, 
But wealth's a 
heeting joy ; 
The wealthy, like the poor, oft have 
Their share of life's alloy. 
Let each look round, and if he can, 
Extend a 
helping hand ; 
The peasant thus may vie the peer— 
The richest in the land. 
Glitter and glare, &c.

A Beautiful Cloth Cult Volume. 
Read what two leading New York Ditpers say of it. 
The New 
York Evening Mail writes: 
A little book has lately appeared in print at Messrs. Fisher & 
Denison's, 98 Nassau street, called "The Little Flirt." We 
cannot 
essi that we recommend it to our young lady and gentlemen readers, 
as we think it would only encourage the bad h- bit of " flirting." 
Unfortunately there is enough of it done without any further neces-
sity of explaining "how, when and where to do it," and this little 
volume would advise and initiate the uncorrupted in practising what 
is commonly called "flirting." 
The N. Y. Evening Telegram, writes: 
We have lately seen a 
neat little book, bound in morocco, costing 
25 cents, called "The Little Flirt," published by Messrs. Fisher & 
Denison, 98 Nassau street. 
It gi
ves i
nf
ormati
on 
of 
the 
modus 
oper-
andi of flirting., and of the meaning of every motion of the hand-
kerchief, fan, glove and parasol. As there is nothing at all objec-
tionable in the volume, and its contents might afford some innoceritt 
amusement to many, we do not hesitate to recommend it to ouz 
young lady and gentlemen readers. 
The LITTLE FLIRT contains Fourteen Silhouette Illus-
trations.
