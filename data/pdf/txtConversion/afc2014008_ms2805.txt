oyalty s
hall be paid the Illustrator on c
opies given away for the purposes of promotion,
 
or otherwise, on c
opies accidentally destroyed or damaged, and on c
opies s
old off as re-
mainders at a price below manufacturing cost.  The Publisher may publish, or permit others
 
to publish without compensation, such s
elections from said book and illustrations as in
 
the judgment of the Publisher will benefit the sale; and there s
hall not be any liability
 
for c
ompensation to the Illustrator therefor.
 
8
.  In addition, the Publisher shall pay t
o the Illustrator a r
oyalty equal to 
 
of all net income received by the Publisher on account o
f s
aid illustrations, from s
ources
 
other than the sale of said illustrations in said book.
 
9
.  The Publisher shall render r
oyalty statements, duly audited and notarized, to the
 
Illustrator semi-annually, as of April 30 and October 31 of each year; (
such dates being
 
herein referred t
o as "royalty dates") such statements t
o be reported, and payment there-
under made, within thirty days after such dates.
 
10.  The Illustrator shall defend the said c
opyright against all adverse claims,
 
whether for copyright infringement, plagiarism or otherwise; and s
hall indemnify the
 
Publisher and save it free and harmless from any loss, liability or damage on account of
 
any claims, for libel, invasion of privacy, or otherwise, arising out of the publication
 
of said illustrations.  The foregoing indemnity shall include attorney's fees.
 
11.  The Illustrator grants to the Publisher t
he right to bring, in its own name or
 
in the name of the Illustrator, as plaintiff or complainant, any action or proceeding
 
for the enjoining of any infringement of the c
opyright in the said illustrations and for
 
any damages resulting therefrom.  Expenses of such action and recovery therefrom s
hall
 
be borne and shared by Illustrator and Publisher.  If either party shall fail or refuse
 
t
o bear his respective share of such expense, the other party shall have the right t
o
 
proceed alone, at his own expense; in which event all recoveries from such proceeding
 
shall be the sole property of such party.
 
12.  The Illustrator shall be entitled to receive ten c
opies of the book free.
 
13.  The Illustrator agrees that, as long as this book shall be in print, he will
 
not contract to publish or furnish to any other publisher for sale or trade, or otherwise,
 
any illustrations upon the same subject that, in the opinion of the Publisher, shall c
on-
flict with the illustrations herein specified.
 
l
L.  The Illustrator agrees to obtain and furnish to the Publisher the written c
on-
sent and release of all persons whose person or property appears in said illustrations,
 
permitting the use of s
aid illustrations in accordance with the provisions of this agree-
ment.  Should fees or other payment be required for such permission, he will pay same
 
promptly as required by the person giving such consent, or, with the written c
onsent of
 
the Publisher, in which case the amount so paid shall be charged against and deducted
 
from the Illustrator's royalty earnings.
 
l.  At any time after the expiration of two years from t
he date of t
he first publi-
cation of said illustrations, the Publisher may relieve itself of any obligation further
 
to publish or promote the sale of such illustrations by notice thereof in writing to the
 
Illustrator.  Such notice s
hall not terminate this Agreement, but shall terminate only
 
the rights of publication and sale granted hereunder; and the Illustrator shall there-
after be free to c
ontract with other persons for the publication and sale of said illus-
trations.  Such termination shall not prevent the Publisher from selling or otherwise
 
disposing of any c
opies of the illustrations on hand.
 
16.
 N
either the Illustrator nor t
he Publisher shall be liable for delay or default
 
in the performance of this Agreement if such delay or default i
s due to any cause beyond
 
the c
ontrol of such party, including but not limited to acts of God, fire, governmental
 
restraint or interference, abnormal c
onditions existing in manufacturing, publishing and
 
distribution of b
ooks, or shortage in manufacturing facilities, personnel and materials.
 
17.  If any legal action shall be brought to enforce the terms o
f this Agreement,
 
the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover attorney s fees.
 
18.  Any n
otice t
o be given hereunder may be given in person or by registered mail
 
directed to t
he party at the address set f
orth herein.
 
19.  The Illustrator agrees that any account, bills, advance, or amounts of any
 
nature that may be due the Publisher by the Illustrator, whether under this Agreement or
 
not, shall be c
hargeable against and may be deducted from any or all moneys accruing to
 
2
 
the Illustrator under this and/or other agreements between the Illustrator and t
he Pub-
lisher.
 
20.  No insurance whatever need be e
ffected by the Publisher for t
he Illustrator.
 
21.  If any part, clause, provision or c
ondition of this Agreement shall be held or
 
declared to be illegal, invalid, void or inoperative, such invalidity shall not affect
 
any other clauses, provisions or c
ondition hereof; and the remainder of this Agreement,
 
disregarding such invalid portion, shall nevertheless c
ontinue in full force and e
ffect
 
as though such void clause, provision or c
ondition had not been c
ontained herein.
 
22.  This Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the
 
successors and assigns of the Publisher and the heirs, executors, administrators and
 
assigns of the Illustrator.
