The earthenwares were covered w

 mixture
 
o

For s

Around 1750, potters f

were f

by work f

J

is

n 1959. J
ugtown was purchased by J
oh n
 
Mare i
n 1960. Mare began r
estoration o
f t

and put t

J

Vernon l

These g

I

HISTORY OF SEAOROVE AREA POTTERY
 
So meti me during the 18th century, l
ong before the American Revolution, a
 t
radition
 
was s
tarted i
n North Carolina. A potter whose name i
s l
ost i
n h
istory p
laced a
 ball
 
of c
lay on a
 ho memade k
ick wheel and turned the f
irst p
iece of North Carolina
 
t
raditional pottery. I
t
 was a
 f
unctional p
iece of ware, a
 p
late f
or the f
a mily t
able, or
 
a
 bowl or p
ickle
 jar orjug. The p
iece was l
ikely f
ired i
n a
 ground hog k
iln of the
 
potter's making and g
lazed with a
 t
ransparent g
laze of the t
ime.
 
The t
radition s
tarted more than 200 years ago continues t
o this date i
n the Sea-
grove area, i
n so me cases by potters who r
epresent the e
ighth and n
inth genera-
t
ions of potter f
a milies i
n North Carolina. I
n the early years, Seagrove potters c
rafted
 
a
lmost solely utilitarian g
lazed earthenware or s
toneware -
 churns, milk c
rocks,
 
jars f
or s
toring f
ood, whiskey
 jugs and k
itchenware. But by the early 20th century,
 
North Carolina's s
tills were c
losed and there was l
i
ttle need f
or whiskey
 jugs. And as
 
g
lass containers beca me more com mon, there was l
i
ttle need, e
ither, f
or s
toneware
 
milk and f
ood containers.
 
So me potteries c
losed i
n the early 1900s, but a
 r
evival of the i
ndustry began about
 
1920 when the potters began c
reating art pottery t
o sell t
o Yankee v
isitors f
ro m the
 
F
'
inehurst r
esort i
n P
inehurst, N
. C
. about 30 miles south of Seagrove. The t
ourists
 
had no need f
or milk c
rocks and jugs, but they d
id want vases and p
itchers and
 
other decorative ware. They brought p
ictures of those they l
iked and the potters
 
began copying so me designs but a
lways adding their own personal twist.
 
A
lso, i
n 1917, Jacques and Juliana Busbee established Jugtown Pottery t
o preserve
 
the f
olk pottery of the area. There f
or many years Ben Owen r
e-created t
raditional
 
salt-glazed s
toneware and the orange earthenware. I
n 1924, Northstate Pottery,
 
another important r
evivalist pottery, was opened a
t Sanford, North Carolina, with
 
potters Jonie Owen and Walter N
. Owen. There a
re many other exa mples of o
ld
 
pottery f
a milies such as Cole and Owens who a
re s
till operating shops t
oday a
long
 
with na mes l
ike Teague, Luck, Chriscoe, K
ing, A
lbright and many others.
 
The t
ens of thousands of v
isitors who co me t
o the Seagrove area each year t
o see,
 
enjoy and buy pottery, f
ind the l
egendary names of North Carolina pottery s
till
 
s
trong and thriving a
long with more r
ecent potters who a
re now contributing t
o
 
the t
radition. V
isitors themselves are a
 part of the t
radition. While 18th and 19th
 
century pottery was sold f
ro m covered wagons t
raveling s
lowly throughout the
 
s
tate, the annual t
rek t
o Seagrove t
o purchase pottery f
or f
a mily use and g
ifts has
 
been a
 r
itual f
or thousands of f
a milies s
ince the early 1900s. Generations of new
 
brides have s
tarted their f
a mily l
i
fe with p
lace settings of Seagrove area pottery, as
 
d
id their mothers and grand mothers before them. The t
radition continues and you
 
are a
 part of i
t
.
 
A
lthough Seagrove i
s a
 small central North Carolina com munity, the Seagrove na me
 
i
dentifies a
 l
arger pottery area i
ncluding portions of Randolph, Moore, Montgo mery
 
and Lee counties. I

over the past two centuries, and i
t
 i

radition.
