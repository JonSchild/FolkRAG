Entered according to Act of Congress, in the year 1879. by A. J. FISHER,

Copyrighted by A. J. FISHER, 1879. 
Good evening to you, one and all, 
We just come out for to sing to you a 
song; 
It is all about when we landed in America, 
And we won't detain you long. ( Break.) 
When we first landed in America 
We were hired for a 
dollar a 
day, 
Shoveling smoke down in the gas house— 
And all the Issh boys would say: 
CHORUS. 
Come all you boys and join together, 
Hands all round, and we'll all say shake. 
Balance all and swing your partners, 
All the Irish boys would say. (Repeat Chorus.) 
When we first landed in Castle Garden 
We went up-town to buy us some flutes, 
And we went over on the Bowery 
And all the boys said we were galutes. (Break.) 
And now, kind friends, we must be going, 
For with you we cannot stay; 
We must go back to the gas house 
Where we get our dollar a 
day.

The Serio-Comics' Ball. 
Written by JOSEPH SPARKS of SPARKS BROTHERS, and sung by him in 
their original sketch, ' The Galway Lawyers." 
The serio-comics' held a 
convention and scraped thirty dollars 
together, 
They resolved to give a 
first-class 
ball, providing it was 
rainy weather. 
They hired a 
Chinese band that came direct from Kalamazoo, 
They charged three cents to put away your hat, and sprin-
kled the floor with glue. 
The song- and-dance men came in dozens, with their uncles 
and their aunts, 
It looked like if some one was pulling the string, you'd grow 
fat to see them dance, oh ! 
Powder, paint and wigs were plenty, the song-and-dance men 
gave the serio-comics' a 
stall— 
Said they never had so much fun since they had the measles, 
at the serio-comics' ball. 
CHORUS. 
Little Maggie Shotgun throws flips and backs in tights, • 
She sang five verses of a 
clog, Mary Clothesline put out the 
lights. 
Then there was a 
terrible fight, Maggie slugged Pedro awful 
gall; 
It was as good as going in swimming on Christmas, at the 
serio-comics' ball. 
You had ought to see the fun when they were shaking dice 
for supper, 
Some had on porous plasters and ulsters, and were walking on 
their uppers. 
They offered an elegant prize to the best dancer on her toes ; 
She danced eleven seconds and danced so long they all 
thought that she was froze. 
Mary Hard-luck the spzeler, and Erastus James O'Brien, 
Ate forty pies and eighty hams and sixty bottles of wine. 
The proprietor kicked for hall rent, then he put them out of 
the hall, 
The police have taken measures to prevent another serio-
comic ball. 
Little Maggie Shotgun, &c. 
Charles Frederick Horace O'Brien. 
Written by JAS. RICHMOND expressly for JOE. SPARKS, of the SPARKS 
BROTHERS, and sung by him with tremendous success. 
There is a 
young man in this city 
Whom I 
met one afternoon; 
He is a 
darling dry goods clerk, 
And he is on the verge of ruin. 
The girls say he is a 
charmer, 
His father married Baby Mine; 
The admiration of the girls is 
Charles Frederick Horace O'Brien. 
CHORUS, 
For his form is like an umbrella, 
His looks are very bold, 
His feet would go in a 
thimble, 
His necktie is solid gold; 
His eyes they are imported, 
His age is twenty-nine, 
The first man played " Ralph Rackstraw," 
Was Charles Frederick Horace O'Brien. 
Last summer he beat his boarding house, 
And skipped to a 
country farm, 
Where he met Matilda Agnes Jowles, 
She was a 
young school marm. 
He got her on a 
rope aad gave her chewing gum, 
And says " Baby, thou art mine." 
And her brother fired cannon balls 
At Charles Frederick Horace O'Brien. 
For his form is like, & c. 
He left and sailed for Europe, 
Where he calls himself Prince. 
To the Queen of Dublin he made love, 
Said his money was counted in mints; 
The Mayor of Russia calls him Bogus, 
And he got tripped up so fine 
That the Duchess of Italy gave ten years to 
Charles Frederick Horace O'Brien. 
For his form is like, &c. 
The Breakneck Micks. 
Written by JOHN G. 
SPARKS. 
Dedicated to BILLY RomssoN, the only 
rival of SHEEHAN & JONES. 
We just come out before ye now, 
clilink it is our name ; 
Our occupation is painting white vests, 
We arrived on the cattle train. 
We were with the circus fourteen nights, 
Doing tight- rope tricks, 
Just watch us now and we'll show you how 
To be two breakneck micks. 
CHORUS. 
Fall on your neck, walk on your eye, 
Do a 
ballet dance on hct bricks; 
So pike us all and stag the gall 
Of the only breakneck micks. 
We throw a 
triple somersault 49 feet high, 
Wrestle with a 
lion in his cage ; 
We beat Signor Flyn and Mons. McGin 
Leaping through knives from the gallery to the 
stage. 
We were born in Hoboken, near the county Meath, 
Our heads are as sound as bricks, 
So when we are away we know you'll say, 
Five cheers for the breakneck micks. 
Written by W M. SCANLON, dedicated to the SPARKS BROTHERS, and sung 
by them with great success. 
Oh here we are, two Irish men, 
As you can plainly see; 
We never weakened in the field, 
Wherever we may be, 
And with our swords in our hands 
We rush unto the foe— 
We're known to come out second-best 
Wherever we may go. 
CHORUS. 
For we're warriors bold from where the grass grows green, 
You can bet your life we're the best that ever was seen. 
When the cannons loudly roar we rush into the foe— 
We're the boys from where the grass grows green. 
(Repeat Chorus) 
They say no Irish need apply, 
But that we can't understand, 
For what would the Americans do 
If it wasn't for Paddy's land ? 
And when we go into the battle 
We're never known to win, 
Unless the ranks are well filled out 
With the best of Irish men. 
For we're warriors bold, &c.

See that my Grave is Whitewashed 
Every Summer. 
Written by JAS. MCAVOY expressly for the SPARKS BROTHERS, and sung 
by them with tremendous success. 
When I've cashed in my checks, little Rosebud, 
When I 
am six foot under the turf, 
I 
forgive you, but you played me for a 
gilly, 
You worked me for every nickel I 
was worth. 
Oh, you said I 
could look, but mustn't touch, 
And you put me in such a 
dilemma ; 
But there is one little snap I 
want to fake up between us— 
That is, see that my grave is whitewashed every' summer. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, the days will come to your poison face. 
Think of how you backcapped me when I 
was living. 
Clean the snow off, when I'm planted, with a 
shovel, 
darling, 
And decorate my grave with turkeys' breasts, Thanks-
giving. 
Don't get cranky when I 
ask you to remember, 
When you used to give me taffy on the stick, 
And with your funny gags you paralyzed me— 
But, my darling, you can't say I 
ever kicked. 
I 
will meet you in the happy land of Canaan, 
Tra-la-lee, skip the sewer, for you are my baby; 
Plant huckleberry trees in the next lot to where I'm 
planted, darling, 
And see that my grave is kept shady. 
Oh the days will come, &c.

Senator -Michael Duffy. 
Written by JAS. RICHMOND expressly for Joz SPARKS, of SPARKS 
BROTHERS. 
Before ye stands an Irishman 
Troubled with enlargement of the gall, 
Sure I 
was four days in America, 
Boys, when I 
joined in Tammany Hall. 
And they put me up for Senator 
Against a 
man named Terry Hughes, 
I 
broke his heart—I 
carried the ward— 
I 
got the votes of all the Irish Jews. 
CHORUS. 
For I 
am Senator Michael Duffy from Sligo, 
I 
am a 
gentleman of talent and fame, 
And for to make a 
political speech all the Senators I 
can teach, 
Oh, for Senator Michael Duffy has got the brain. 
T 
itiations all in the Senate, 
Me sister Kate and me cousin Mike O'Neil, 
Zitey got a 
hundred dollars a 
month for washing dishes, 
And all that they could steal.

Ehooting grasshoppers just to have a 
laugh, 
I 
sold ninety thousand in a 
week— 
They thought it was Frank Lum's lithograph.

The Barnum. Show. 
Written by J
AS. RICHMOND expressly for the SPARKS BROTHERS. 
We are a 
couple of North of Ireland micks, 
We are on the tight rope and slack wire ; 
We traveled with Barnum for eleven years 
As Signor Duffy and Mons. McGuire. 
We can throw double somersaults on our neck, 
Three hundred flip- flaps we can throw, 
We used to eat cannon balls for our dinner, 
When we traveled with the Barnum Show. 
CHORUS. 
We done a 
statue clog with the fat woman once, 
Killed a 
lion with a 
blow; 
We used to hide from the sheriff in the elephant's trunk, 
When we traveled with the Barnum Show. 
We done a 
highland fling on a 
horizontal bar, 
We learned all the monkeys to play the cornet ; 
We slept in the cage along with the animals, 
When it rained we got soking wet. 
It was us that painted the tattooed Greek, 
And we'd have you all to know 
We were the greatest curiosity out, 
When we traveled with the Barnum Show. 
We done a 
statue dog, & c.

Handsome as a 
Handcart. 
Written by J

by them with trem endous success throughout the country. 
Copyrighted by A. J. FISHER, 1879. 
Oh my heart is gone but my gall remains, 
A 
charming girl went through me ; 
She took my cash, for I 
was too fresh, 
And she gave me a 
terrible skin. 
I 
was on the booze, I 
lay down to snooze 
The first time she beheld me, 
And she worked the fake, for the graft was great, 
And I 
seen her in my dreams. 
When she went through me; (Sym.) 
And she knew me! (Sym.) 
She worked me for my wealth. 
And didn't leave a 
nickel! (Sym.) 
She surprised me! ( Sym.) 
She paralyzed me ! ( Sym.) 
And she played me for a 
gilly all the while. 
CHORUS. 
That Italian gal, no I 
never shall 
Forget the day she worked me. 
I 
will let her be, for she roasted me— 
I'm just as fresh as she. (Dance) 
Oh that poison face got me off my base, 
And she played me for a 
gilly; 
And said I 
was no good, and try name was mud, 
Tra-la-lee, George, look for work. 
Then I 
pulled a 
pop and she took a 
drop, 
Then she did not seem so giddy. 
She winked her eye and gave me the guy, 
And she tickled me under the chin. 
She's as handsome 
As a 
handcart ! (Sym.) 
With her head stuck in an ash barrel— 
Picking cinders! (Sym.) 
She's a daisy ! ( Sym.) 
She's terrible lazy! (Sym.) 
And she played me for a 
gIlly all the while. 
That Italian gal, &c.

What a 
pleasure there is dancing at a 
raffle, 
On a 
Saturday night when the gas shines bright, 
When all the girls are tickled to death with laughing, 
You will find us blazing tight. 
At every hop and every ball we always swipe a 
check, 
And our opinion now we'll tell—a 
raffle sweeps the deck. 
CHORUS. 
What a 
pleasure there is dancing at a 
raffle, 
For an alarm sewing machine or an eight-day stove 1 
Oh that's the time the girls will give you taffy— 
That is the sport we love. 
Shake, shake, thirty-six is high ( Break.) 
Pass around the lemonade, the ladies they are dry. (Break.) 
(Repeat first four lines.) 
What a 
pleasure there is dancing at a 
raffle, 
For a 
double-barreled watch or an eight-day goat, 
That's where you will see us do our double shuffle, 
With our piccadilly flyaway coat. 
With our Cony Island sluggers we always cut a 
dash, 
And allithe girls wherever we go they use us for a 
mash. 
What a 
pleasure there is, &c. 
Nick Murphy's Cousin Jerry. 
Written by JAMES RICHMOND for JOE SPARKS, of the SPARES BROTHERS, 
Jerry Rosenfeldt it is my name, 
I 
am a 
pedestrian of note; 
I 
was eighty-nine the 4th of May, 
My brother is a 
billy goat. 
I'll beat O'Leary, Hazael or Merritt, 
My cousin Nicholas or Theodore Biles. 
At Hoboken Park in a 
six days' walk 
I 
made six hundred and thirty miles. 
CHORUS. 
I'll walk two hundred miles in twenty hours— 
Don't think I 
am crazy, for I 
am a 
loon. 
I've sent a 
challenge to Blower Brown 
To walk around the world and steal the moon. 
I 
got seventy pine wood medals home, 
To take the belt and cake I'll try; 
I 
walked with my wife on my back to Texas 
And never ate nothing but Sampsonian pie. 
My eldest son Patrick Joseph 
Learned Hanlan how to row; 
He sent him seventy cents from Canada 
About seven months ago. 
I 
got a 
mare sired by Hambletonian, 
I 
use her drawing bricks and coal, 
Give her fifty points in a 
game of pool or billiards 
And I'll bet she'll beat Parole. 
I'll walk two hundred miles, &c.

Levi Kassiday. 
IRISH COMIC SONG. 
Written, composed and sung by J. E. 
M URPHY, of MURPHY tk: Meer 
in the laughable sketch, entitled " The Secret." 
Published and copyrighted 1879, by E. 
H . 
HARDING'S, 229 -Bowery and 
sent to any address, post-paid, on receipt of 35 cents. 
Now list ye to my classic lay, 
Politely hearken loudly, while 
I 
sing of Levi Kassiday, 
A 
blazing star of solid style ; 
From Coney Isle to Zululand, 
From sweet Cohohohoes to Newfoundland, 
Roam where you will a 
man you'll never find 
Like Levi Kassiday. 
CHORUS. 
For he's a 
man, understan, wid a 
very fine eye for a 
nica 
young girl, 
And a 
prim° judge of Dublin wine, 
And creamy cream of the style, do you mind, 
Wid a 
rose like his nose, 
Of a 
color as bright as the red blue say, 
Oh, it's on the street, there's few you'll meet 
Like Levi Kassiday. 
A- down the street with stately tread, 
And style that dislocates them all, 
Meanders he, enveloped in 
A brand new fresh spring suit of gaul; 
Upon his arm bangs Julia Ann, 
Sweet lady bird of this daisy man, 
A Don Juhannes in his mind is he, 
This Levi Kassiday. 
(Chorus.) 
When voices sweet were handed round, 
Levi was not behind the door, 
An over strung bass voice has he, 
He sang the " mast " in " Pinafore" 
From Asialt to Kalamazu, 
From Canada w 
to San Franciscu, 
Another one of it you'll seldom meet 
Like Levi Kassday. 
(Chorus.)

Erin's Isle. 
PAT ROO NEY'S SONG AND DANCE. 
Composed by B. 
HART, 
15 
Copyrighted by A. 
J. FISHER, 1879. 
Here I 
am, an Irish lad, that you can plainly see, 
I've traveled this world o'er and o'er, till I 
got to this land 
of the free. 
From Dublin Bay I 
came away, I 
never fret or sigh, 
For I'm always gay, both night and day, this son of Erin's Isle. 
CHORUS. 
Yes, I 
am an Irish ranting blade, and that I 
never deny, 
And I'll give you all a 
chance for to see the way I 
dance, 
As they do in Erin's Isle. ( Repeat.) 
The other day I 
went astray, I 
never shall forget, 
When a 
pretty little Irish girl oh I 
by chance had met. 
She showed me home, that I 
will own, and this was her reply: 
" 
You I 
do adore, and there is something more, you're a 
son 
of Erin's Isle." 
Yes, I 
am, &c. 
For to return home once more my mind is fully bent, 
And when I 
arrive on the shamrock shore, won't there be a 
grand event. 
My friends and my relations will greet me with all smiles, 
To welcome home one of their own, a 
son of Erin's Isle. 
Yes, I 
am, & c. 
As Sung by THE BRemois. 
Oh! dear, what a 
plague and a 
bother 
Now all you men are to be sure ; 
I'ts really too bad, ' pon my honor, 
In fact, I 
may say quite a 
bore; 
There's Charlie does nothing but worry me 
All about naming the day; 
But, I 
tell him that I'm in no hurry, 
And often he makes me say— 
CHOBTJS. 
" 
Don't bother me, Charlie, 
Don't you be such a 
tease! 
It's no use, Charlie, 
I 
shall marry whenever I 
please !" 
You men you are all such deceivers, 
We find you out more ey'ry day; 
And we girls are such silly believers 
In ev'rything you choose t') say; 
Such sweet, pretty, soft little speeches— 
Such devotion, ah! never w2s seen; 
Only sometimes experience teaches, 
That you've said rather more than you mean! 
" 
Don't bother," &c. 
You all say that as soon as you're married, 
You'll settle down quiet in life ; 
And never away you'll be carried, 
From your dear little, good little wife ; 
But, oh! I've known one or two cases, 
Where the dear loving husband will roam! 
And you'll see him in all sorts of places, 
But seldom you'll see him at home! 
" 
Don't bother," &e. 
Charlie says he will do something shocking— 
For a 
soldier, or sailor he'll go ; 
Or hang himself up with his stocking ! 
I 
hope he don't mean it, you know. 
Of course, I 
should not like to lose him, 
For I 
do think thnt Charlie is true; 
And, perhaps, it's not right to abuse him— 
I 
don't think it is, now,—do you? 
" 
Don't bother," &c. 
As sung by PAT ROONEY.

I'm a 
man that's known both far and near, 
McCluskey that's my name, 
An' all the politicians, sure, 
Are envious of my fame; 
I 
got a 
grip in the auld Sixth 'Ward, 
And ye bet I 
make it pay, 
An' I 
hould a 
high position 
Upon Election Day. 
As I 
walk through the ward, 
As proud as a 
lord, 
The gang rise their hats and cry out, " Clear 
the way." 
Oh ! for style an' for air, 
There is none to compare 
Wid McCluskey on Election Day. 
It was on last election time, 
I 
ran for Alderman, 
My political antagonist 
Was a 
loafer named McCann; 
But I 
trated all the boys I 
met, 
From Harlem to Cow Bay, 
And they said they'd vote nine times for me 
Upon Election Day. 
Election time came quickly round, 
I 
wint to make a 
speech, 
But the gang they knocked thesplatforrn down, 
And I 
loud for help did screech. 
Now although I 
didn't get the place, 
Just listen to what I'll say, 
t'll play them all for suckers 
On next Election Day. 
As I 
walk, & c. 
I 
Havn't an Equal. 
Written by CHAS. DOCKSTADER for SHEEHAN and JONES. 
Oh some facts I 
am now going to tell ye's, 
And of course I'll enlighten your minds, - 
Whin you've heard all me discourse this evening, 
Faith I 
hope you's won't turn away blind. 
I'm a 
great politician and statesman likewise; 
I 
could greatest improvements invent. 
Then form strong resolutions widout desolutions, 
And make me your next President. 
CHORUS. 
I 
am courted be young girls and ladies, 
They're in love wid me style and me grace, 
Ah, me figure and form are intrancing; 
Don't you think I've an ilegant face ? 
Well, I'm Irish, and I 
knows you's don't think it, 
For of course ye's all thought I 
was Frinch; 
I've the greatest respect for officials, 
From a 
policeman till the judge on his binch. 
I've a 
friend in the city in business— 
He does carry a 
sign for a 
store— 
He's a 
man of high standing and laming, 
And his equal you never see more. 
CHORUS. 
I've a 
cart and a 
proud Irish donkey, 
And I 
often goes out for a 
drive. 
Shure I 
has the whole neighborhood crazy 
In the part of the town I 
reside. 
AN ORIGINAL AND BEAUTIFUL BALLAD, 
Words by Thos. Daly. Music by Willis Clark. Air by Morton Emerson. 
Notes by Wm. Daly. 
'Neath the gleaming of the wildwood by the starlight, 
Where the purpling of the daylights gentle fall, 
Lived a 
loving, laughing darling, charming maidlet, 
Diving deeply in the denseless of the doll. 
Cnonus. 
Standing by the gatelet, 
Where the merry maiden wait), 
I 
tell you it was greatlet, 
Such 2.. charming happy fatelet, 
Where the hilltops were floating in the breAzes, 
Dodging hailstones from the ,

simoon, 
Picking sponges in the dewliglit of the moo 
'Neath the darling, charming, oM 
CHORUS. 
Oh, such a 
happy lotlet, 
Standing by the cotlet, 
I 
tell you it was hotlet, 
Then she hit me with a 
botlet 
OH! ERIN, my country, though strangers may roam 
Thy hills and thy mountains I 
once called my own 
Thy lakes and thy valleys no longer I 
see, 
But warmly as ever my heart beats for thee. 
Cnonus. 
Oh I "Cushla Machree" my heart beats for thee, 
Erin! Erin I 
my heart beats for thee. 
Long years have passed o'er us since the last time va.s met 
But lived I 
a 
thousand I 
could not forget: 
The warm heart that loved me, 
The bright eyes that shone 
Like stars in the heaven of days that are gone. 
Oh I "Cushla Machree." Sm. 
Pear home of my youth, I 
shall ne'er see thee more, 
But memory treasures the bright days of yore: 
And my heart's latest wish, the last sigh of my breast 
Shall be for thee, dear home, the :and of tze west.

It's her I'm going for to see ; 
I'm going to take her to a 
dance to-night, 
And it's happy we will be, 
She's not very stout, she's not very thin, 
But I 
want you all to understand, 
To sing a 
song or dance a 
jig 
She can beat all the girls in the land. 
CHORUS. • 
She can sing, (AYm.) 
She can sing, ( Sym.) 
She's my Irish colleen everybody knows. 
Arrah, whenever a 
fiddle begins to play 
Now this is the way she goes— (Dance.) 
My Katie dear, my little Katie dear, 
We're going to be married soon; 
I 
feel so happy, boys and girls, 
And as proud as the richest gossoon. 
And when we settle down in — here, 
All the people in the town we'll invite. 
You can bet your dime we'll have a 
good time, 
We'll not go home till broad daylight. 
CHORUS. 
We will sing, ( Sym.) 
We will dance, (Sym.) 
We'll have a 
good time, now remember, sure, 
And when old Murphy squeezes the pipes, 
It's then we'll welt the floor. 
I 
don't like a 
fellow who's stingy and close, 
And can't bear to part with a 
crown, 
Nor yet do I 
like him who's stern and morose, 
And looks on the world with a 
frown ; 
But give me the fellow whoe'er he may be, 
Who cares not for peasant or king, 
Who likes a 
good spree, that's the fellow for me, 
And with him I'll merrily sing--
CHORUS. 
Drink, boys, drink, and let your glasses jingle, 
Drink, boys, drink, and bid dull care be gone, 
Shout, boys, shout, and let your voices mingle, 
We'll all get jolly as the night wears on. 
'Tis fine of an evening when business is done, 
And the toils of the day have gone past, 
To sit in the parlor of some cosy pub. 
And drown all your cares in a 
glass ; 
Let squeamish teetot'lers drink coffee and tea, 
And prate of the coppers. they save, 
I 
laugh at their cant, and tho' they may rant, 
I'll sing till I'm laid in my grave— 
Drink, boys, drink, 
Of friends I've a 
few, such a 
rollicking crew, 
And trouble assails us in vain, 
We meet every night and often get tight, 
On brandy or glorious champagne ; 
For frolic and noise faith we are the boys, 
And then as the hours speed along, 
We call in the host, who gives us a 
toast, 
Or sings us this right jovial song— 
Drink, boys, drink, & c. 
To fall deep in love with a 
sweet turtle dove, 
Very fine for some fellows may be, 
But the exquisite bliss of a 
woman's sweet kiss, 
Has no great attraction for me ; 
At young Cupid's shrine to kneel I 
decline, 
To Bacchus I'll stick hard and fast, 
With a 
dollar to spend and another to lend, 
And gaily I'll sing to the last— 
Drink, boys, drink, &c. 
Composed by Ned Talbot for J. E. Murphy, of Murphy & Mack. 
I 
went down to Goerck street 
To a 
nice little surprise party, 
And the charmer that I 
m t 
there was 
The darling, Biddy McCarthy. 
Now Biddy was the finest girl, 
And the amusement of the party, 
Says 1, I'm surely dead in love 
With the darling, Biddy McCarthy. 
ClioRus. 
With me tra-la-lee, now don't you see, 
I'm gone on Biddy McCarthy. 
We danced the polka " mazourka," 
Likewise the dizzy lanciers, 
And as we moved around the floor 
We were two darling dancers. 
Says Biddy, sure I 
feel afraid 
That I'll have to shake the party, 
I 
says wait awhile until I 
smile, 
And I'll go home with you Biddy McCarthy. 
(Chorus.\ 
As I 
went home to Biddy's house 
A. laughing, talking, chatting, 
I 
met her father at the door 
All out of breath a 
panting. 
Says he, now Biddy where did you get this, 
Did you get him at the party, 
Oh, yes, you honor was the reply 
From darling Biddy McCarthy. 
I 
am happy now, I 
have a 
cow, 
Likewise a 
pig and a 
daughter, 
I 
live in a 
cot in a 
shady spot 
Away across the water. 
My mother-in-law she calls on me, 
She is a 
roaring tartar, 
Her husband as well is like a 
bull, 
But I 
love my Biddy McCarthy. 
(Chorus.)

Written by JAMES RICHMOND kr JOHN W HITNEY. 
Oh, I've got a 
wife her name is Christine, 
She is a 
hundred and nineteen, her nose it iigreen, 
She can crawl through a 
gas pipe, 
She's getting so lean, 
She can waltz on her eyebrows all night, 
If I 
tell her to wash my porous plaster, 
Its then she will kick, slug me with a 
brick, 
Make me go 10 the butchers for tick, 
I'll bet you seven do has Johnny Dwyer she can lick, 
For her breath is as strong as an ox. 
Cnonus. 
Oh, if I 
knew the man that learned her to box, 
I'd give him the small pox or Chastine Cox, 
I'd hit him with a 
brick or a 
dozen of rocks, 
For learning my wife how to spar. 
The other evening I 
came home with a 
new pair of pants. 
She stabbed me with a 
lance, 
Then I 
fell in a 
trance, 
Then she picked all my pockets when she got the chap , - 
And danced a 
Dutch reel on my neck, 
She picked me up like a 
baby and Ulm:: azs,- into 'cps,: 
Put a 
bandage on my head, 
I 
thought I 
was dead, 
Next morning when Y. got up I 
ivas bin, white and re, 
And my nose w 
il over my face. 
As sung with tremendous success at the New National Theatre, 
Philadelphia, by FRANK LEWIS. 
I've an object in view I 
would like to unfold, 
It's about this great city that's revelled in gold. 
The pride of our nation well tested above, 
In Philadelphia's great city of brotherly love. 
In the famine of late, though ' tis hard for to state, 
The thought of starvation, and sad was the fate 
Of the many poor families who had nothing in store, 
Till a 
cry came from Heaven, " Give bread to the poor!" 
Now, there's A. T. Stewart, the New York millionaire, 
Who some time ago sought another world's care, 
Would it have hurt his kind heart to throw out a 
dime 
To keep our poor sufferers from prison and crime? 
He invested, I'm told, in a 
great institute, 
In a 
matter of business, you bet he was cute; 
He was not like Jim Fisk, nor will be many more, 
With his lightning express giving bread to the poor 
There's another kind heart, tho' he has been misused, 
In South Carolina, where all was confused; 
He kept down the riot, gave his office for peace, 
While the Rads, in the White House, they sat at their ease. 
In the town of Columbia, which all of you know, 
Their suilering, was great with hunger and woe; 
With his shirt sleeves rolled up, like old Jackson at war, 
bread to the poor.

THE OLD VILLAGE SCHOOL ON THE 
GREEN, 
Written by FRANK VAN HESS for ED. BURTON, and sung by him 
with great success. 
.01-
1! I 
love the bright days of my youth to review, 
And fancy again I'm a 
boy, 
With my merry companions so faithful and true, 
And friendship that knows no alloy. 
Oh ! the thoughts I 
review as I 
ponder the past, 
Recalling each dear youthful scene ; 
The one I 
most prize, and will love to the last, 
Is the old village school on the green. 
(Repeat two last lines.) 
Near the old village school the cottage still stands, 
Where I 
first saw the dawn of light ; 
And now over its porch in rich clustering bands, 
The roses are blooming as bright 
As ' twas when with garlands and wreaths of wild flowers, 
We joyously crowned our May Queen, 
And told childish love tales in neat little bowers, 
Near the old village school on the green. 
(Repeat two last lines.) 
I 
have left many dear and some loved ones behind 
To rest as I've journeyed along; 
There are others remain just as faithful and kind, 
To join in the laugh and the song; 
And when I 
am ca,led by grim death to prepare, 
will answer with spirit serene, 
they'll la.)- me to rest when I 
breathe my last prayer, 
tear the old village school on the green. 
_ (Repeat two last lines) 
CHORUS. 
Swim out says Pete, arrah kick your feet, 
Go over-hand says brother Jim, 
The gang did shout as they dragged me out, 
The night I 
learned to swim. 
Oh " ehaw roast- beef, the beef is tough," 
The gang sung out to me ; 
They daubed my face with lumps of tar, 
I 
looked like a 
Chinee. 
I 
made back dives and somersaults, 
Along Nvith Shorty Tim ; 
Both my feet were cut with copper nails, 
The night I 
learned to swim. 
(Chorus.) 
I 
was chock full of salt water, 
Brought to a 
liquor store, 
There they rolled me on a 
barrel, 
For two long hours or more. 
Sure they made me drink some brandy, 
I 
had the jim-jam-jams, 
I'll ne'er for(fet, as long as I 
live, 
The night I 
learned to swim. 
(Chorus)

One summer's night ten years ago, 
The gang and brother Jim, 
Brought me down to the dock you know, 
To learn me how to swim. 
They tied a 
rope around my waist, 
And then they heaved me in, 
To tell the truth, I 
was nearly drowned, 
The night I 
learned to swim.

Kiss Me, Mamma, Kiss Me. 
Composed by Wm. A. 
HUNTLEY, and sung by J. S. 
KELLY, of Corncrse 
Minstrels. 
" 
Kiss me mamma, kiss me, 
For I 
am going to sleep," 
Reechoed through the boat's saloon 
That night upon the deep. 
The little one who spoke the words 
Was merry, sweet and fair, 
And with a 
loving sister kind, 
They were an angel pair. 
CHORUS. 
" 
Kiss me, mamma, kiss me, 
For I 
am going to sleep," 
Reechoed through the boat's saloon 
That night upon the deep. 
" 
Kiss me, mamma, kiss me, 
For I 
am going to sleep," 
Are words that stirred the strongest hearts, 
That made the tender weep ; 
And when the sinking " Metis " fought 
The surging billows high, 
How painful must have been the sight 
To see the darlings die ! 
" 
Kiss me, mamma," & c. 
" 
Kiss me, mamma, kiss me, 
For I 
am going to sleep," 
Was a 
presentiment most true 
That night upon the deep ; 
Though none had thought the coming morn 
They'd perish in the waves, 
Or that the little ones so soon 
Would leep in silent graves. 
" 
Kiss me, mamma,' 
Written by C. R. Dockstader, for and sung by J. D. Rooms. 
As I 
was a 
reading the paper last night, 
I 
saw there a 
story that I 
will recite, 
It's about a 
young damsel got stuck on a 
clerk, 
She bothered him daily while he was at work 
Oh, this gal she would watch him and on him keep an eye, 
She swore she would have him or with him she'd die, 
When she went to embrace him he' d 
yelp loud and strong. 
Get thee gone girl, get thee gone girl, 
But the girl wouldn't get thee gone. 
Oh, she tortured him hourly and stuck just like glue, 
lie wasted away and his clothes he fell through. 
He rented a 
barnyard and slept in the shed, 
And this girl she hung till his reason had fled, 
Now she crawled through a 
knot hole and roost by his sidw 
With a 
hunk of blue ribbon his ankles she tied, 
When he awoke from his sbimbers like a 
hero aid. say, 
Get thee away girl, get thee away girl, 
But the girl wouldn't get thee away. 
Oh, she followed him around alid one evenillg he died, 
He opened his mug and he let his breath slide, 
In an alley way they have laid him to take his last slew. 
Where the tom cats do fight and the bull Zlogs do eat, 
Oh, she dressed herself up in, a 
new sunday coat, 
With some white wash his age on a 
shove: she wrote 
Now she.gets boiling full and the boys all Jo shout. 
Get thee out girl, get thee out girl, 
But the girl don't get thee out.

My face would make a

I

And so can my sisters, and my cousins and my aunts

All of you shout for the funny old Mick, 
All of you shout, and don't holler " Rats"

Oscar Magee. 
Written by JAMES RICHMOND for PAT ROONEY, 
Copyrighted by A. J. FISHER, 1879. 
Oh, ladies and gentlemen, I 
now tell to ye 
About a 
young man named Oscar Magee; 
He had cast-iron teeth, and he never eat hash, 
When his money was all spent he had to pawn his moustache. 
He had a 
brother named DeWitt, in Brooklyn he did preach, 
He married old Corbin down at Manhattan Beach; 
He married them in a 
cellar, he must have been in a 
trance, 
The wedding present was a 
cast-iron overcoat and a 
wooden 
pair of pants. 
He bought a 
gold mine in Hoboken, and he found nothing 
but rocks; 
He went crazy and mad and cut his throat—with a 
pair 
of socks. 
He was found guilty of arson and stealing twenty gold rings, 
Then he was taken 
to a 
coal yard, and hung by the 
shoe strings. 
Driginally sung with thunders of applause throughout the Eastern cities 
by the" Irish Emperors," FAVOR and SHIELDS. 
Here we are, two Lackawanna spooners, 
While we're here cast your eyes upon us; 
We unload coal boats from Harlem to Gowanus, 
We're the two selected spooners of the gang. 
When we go home, our families we embrace, 
We ate our meals with elegance and grace, 
We'll lay aside the shovel, for we long to have a 
race, 
We're the two selected spooners of the gang. 
CHORUS. 
When we go home, our families we embrace, 
We ate our meals with elegance and grace ; 
We'll lay aside the shovel, for we long to have a 
race 
We're the two selected spooners of the gang. 
We all live down in John McSauley's building, 
Last election day we cast our votes for Tilden ; 
And they all do say we're the solidest in the building, 
The two selected spooners of the gang. 
We all get shaved in the one barber shop, 
By the one man, his razor, and his strop ; 
We all get the lather from the one brush and cup, 
The two selected spooners of the gang.

Arrah, my name is Isaac Murphy, 
And 
have ye all to know 
That I 
was born in China, 
Near the county of Mayo. 
I 
can walk six months and never stop, 
I 
can run faster than a 
train ; 
Faith, I 
am soon going over to England, 
To bring the belt Rowell took back again. 
CHORUS. 
I'll walk the first hundred miles on my head, 
The second on my toes; 
The third I'll walk on my eye-brows, 
And the fourth upon my nose. 
The fifth and last I'll walk on my ear, 
Then the Atlantic I 
walk across, 
Sure the Philadelphia Bladder says, 
Of all walkers I 
am the boss. 
I 
can walk from here to Australia and back 
In about three days and a 
half, 
Or around the world in a 
hundred hours— 
When I 
told O'Leary he gave me the laugh 
I 
can walk for a 
year without any sleep, 
And keep waltzing around on the track; 
It would take me ninety minutes, just, 
To walk from here to Germany and back. 
I'll walk the first hundred, &c. 
Nancy Mooney. 
Written and sung by " H ENRY CARNEY" with great success. 
Ochone, weirasthrue! sure my heart's nearly breaking; 
Farewell of my senses I'm sure I 
am taking ; 
Thro' thinking of Nancy, asleep or awaking, 
I'm just like a 
long fishing rod. 
My bosom with anger and sorrow does throb, 
Aich breath that I 
take is turned into a 
sob ; 
I'm as wake as a 
drink of could water, by gob, 
I 
wish I 
was under the sod. 
CHORUS. 
Desateful Nancy Mooney, of me you've made a 
looney, 
Von know since we were childther on you I've been spooney; 
If you don't dhrop gallavantin' wiLh that blackguard, Mickey 
Rooney, 
dhrown myself, and thin my ghost will haunt you night 
and day. 
Ochone, weirasthrue! black-eyed Nancy Machree, 
I 
know you're too good for a 
fellow like me; 
But as sure is the birds love the leaves on the tree 
I 
love you far dearer than life. 
If you'll only become Mrs. Mulligan soon 
I'll sing like a 
bird in the sweet month of June, 
And I'll hop on one leg from Drumlish to the moon 
The day that I 
make you my wife. 
Desateful Nancy Mooney, &c. 
Altho' I 
am delicate, lonely, and wake, 
I'll smash every skull in the land for your sake, 
I'll pitch the ould castle right into the lake, 
I'll ride Prince O'Donoughue's horse. 
I'll swear by all colors—black, yaller, or red,— 
That I'll smash like a 
turnip Mick Rooncy's big head; 
You have broke my poor heart—och, I 
wish I 
was dead, 
Then you might shed a 
tear o'er my corse. 
Desateful Nancy Mooney S..c. 
Only a 
Sweet Little Letter. 
Published by permission of COLLINS & Bux•rox, Portland, Me. 
It is only a 
sweet little letter, 
In my hand that I 
tenderly hold, 
From the one who is dearer and better 
Than the treasure of jewels and gold. 
Many days my poor heart has been sighing 
For this mark of affection to see, 
So then now there is no use denying 
I'm as happy as happy can be. 
CHORUS. 
It is only a 
sweet little letter, 
Whose glad coming I've waited to see, 
Yes, a 
dear little, sweet little letter, 
Just a 
sweet little letter for me. 
It is only a 
sweet little letter, 
But its pages are fill'd with kind words, 
Whose affection is dearer, yes better, 
Than sweet music or carols of birds. 
Oh, they waken glad mem'ries to cheer me, 
As I 
wander afar on life's sea, 
While the sweetest of thoughts linger near me. 
I'm as happy as happy can be. 
it is only a 
sweet little letter, 
But it tells of a 
heart that is true, 
Of a 
love that grows brighter and better 
As the days fade away from my view. 
Yes, it breathes of the fondest devotion, 
That will cling now and ever to me, 
And my heart in its tend'rest emotion, 
I'm as happy as happy can be. 
It is only a 
sweet little letter, &c.

PARODY ON GRANDFATHER'S CLOCK. 
Composed and sung with great success by Andy CoIlum. 
My grandfather's nose was as red as a 
beet, 
And ht used to hang around in the yard, 
Get chuck lull of gin around to Patsey Flynn's, 
With the gang he was always playing cards, 
They stuck him every game and they called for the same, 
So the old guy got chuck full of booze, 
They would lay him on the chairs, stick feathers in his ears, 
While the old bum was taking a 
snooze. 
CHORUS.. 
Thirty years he's been living on gin, gin, gin, gin, 
The neighbqrs around the corner say it's a 
d— sin,sin,sin,sin, 
But he stopped, quick, never to get drunk again, 
When his mother-in-law fired him out the door. 
My grandfather's watch was too large for his pockets. 
So lie used to hang it up on the wall, 
Wit enevcr he got broke of course he would go, 
And give Uncle Simpson a 
call, 
He would ask five or ten, or whetever they would lend, 
To the ruin shop he would steer right away, 
Get full as a 
brick, next morning he was sick, 
While the super in the pawn shop it did lay, 
CHORUS. 
Thirty days he's been lunching around on beans, beans,

The bartender hit him with a

But lie ( lI(pped

When the bar tender stood him on his ear. 
PARODY ON EILEEN ALANNA. 
Composed and sung by Andy Collura. 
I 
big banana peel I've seen you before, 
Your cognon is banana from a 
far distant shore, 
I've heard of you often and what you have done, 
They say you are awful and have lots of fun, 
You lay on the walk so cunning and so sly, 
And tackle the first gauk who chance pass you by, 
lie treads on you lightly and conies down with a 
roar, 
I 
big banana peel you've busted my jaw. 
I 
big banana peel I've seen you before, 
You false-hearted wretch you've deceived me to the core. 
When last I 
did meet you my crystal you did crack, 
You busted my bugle and near broke my back, 
A 
charming young damsel by chance you do meet, 
Is forced to dissolve from under her big feet, 
She rises like an angel and falls like a 
lamb, 
I 
big banana peel you've showed all my gams. 
I 
big banana peel of you I 
want no more, 
You are long, lean and lanky from a 
far distant shore, 
Your skin has turned yellow and slips like an eel, 
iNly pants and suspenders your kindness did feel, 
A 
strawberry blonde on you lightly does tread, 
I:evolves in the air and comes bang on her head, 
My corset strings you've busted and whalebones you've 
sprung, 
iii banana peel.you son of a 
gun.

Come gather you snoozers to you I 
will tell, 
Of a 
lunch route I've found out that will make your head swell. 
Three kinds of soup, there you can get every day, 
Noodle boodle, dumbee doodle, kindle they say, 
It is one, two and three, four, they will stand in a 
line, 
Getting away with lunch, for they never lose time, 
More bread, more bread, one bum you'll hear cry, 
When the bar tender hits him a 
smash in the eye. 
To-morrow they change for a 
better lunch route, 
Get mustard and cehese and dutch sour-krout, 
Red herring, and bologna, and meat so they say, 
Pluck liver and lights boys, dont give it away, 
It's one, two and three, glass of beer at a 
time, 
They swell his nobs head. till he nearly looks blind, 
Nom beer, more beer, the bums they will roar, 
When the dutchman he fires them right out the front door, 
As sung by the F1REEMAN SISTERS. 
I'M Paddy Burke so nate and thrim,

Here's Paddy Burke and Kitty Miles, 
We hope to wreathe your face with smiles;

I'll make him jealous, wait and see, 
Oh, ain't he getting mad !

WHERE CAN MY LITTLE BROTHER BE? 
Where can my little orother be. 
Why ever did he stray? 
His loss has been a 
blow to me, 
I'll hope he'll stay away; 
To bring him back, my love is such, 
I 
must some plan devise, 
My grief is when I 
think how much 
'Twill cost to advertise. 
CHORUS. 
Where can my little brother be ? 
Can he have gone away, 
To study hard at Botany, 
Afar in Botany Bay ? 
He's six feet high and very lean, 
Ills length's his chiefest charm, 
His boots are twelves, his gloves sixteens, 
lie's tatoo'd on his arm; 
His face a 
noble cast was deem' d, 
A 
cast his optics bore, 
ills Roman nose turn'd up, and seein',i 
To say Excelsior. 
CHORUS. 
Where can my little brother be ? 
Why ever did he stray ? 
His loss has been a 
blow to me, 
I'll hope he'll stay away. 
'Twas doubtful when I 
saw him, for 
His form was faint and dim; 
You could not quite be sure which was 
His shadow, which was him ; 
His legs were like the pelican's, 
So tall he seemed indeed, 
With graceful neck, long as the swan's, 
A 
hop pole run to Heed. 
Where can, etc. 
His voice it is a 
baritone. 
And if you heard him try 
To sing, I 
feel assured it would bring 
A 
tear into your eye ; 
His upper notes are like the lark's. 
His lower notes are groans; 
Perhaps the Negro Minstrels have 
Bought him up for bones.

WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN TO-NIGHT, 
JOHN?

obt- iiied from SPEAR & DEIINHOFF, 719 Broadway, N. Y. 
I've just got wed to a 
darling wife, 
We're happy as can be. 
There's only one thing causes strife, 
Of which we can't agree. 
For now and then, like the best of men, 
go out in a 
jovial way, 
And as sure as fate if I 
come home late, 
My wife to me will say: 
Where have you been to-night, John, 
Where have you been to- night; 
You're out so late, and in such a 
state; 
Where have you been to- night, John. 
(Repeat.) 
When I 
go out for an hour or sop 
The time it slips by so fast, 
It's time to go before I 
know 
A 
jclly night has passed. 
lip-etairsd creep; she's fast asleep, 
I 
think I 
hear her snore— 
What a 
sad mistake— she's wide awake, 
When she says to mo once more— 
Where have you, oloc. 
43 
At one or two—or it may be three—' 
I 
quit the festive scene. 
And then my wife will say to me, 
Now tell me whe ,e 
you've been. 
You're out so late—in such a 
state— 
You're not yourself, I 
vow. 
How strange you talk, how queer you walk; 
You really don't know how. 
Spoken.— And just as soon as I 
get into the bedroom, my 
wife said tome: " This is a 
nice time to be coming home, isn't 
it? 
You thought you'd leave your boots outside in the hall, 
and sneak in here and I 
wouldn't know what time you came 
home; but I'm not such a 
fool as I 
look, although goodness 
knows I 
was a 
fool when I 
married you; 
but there, John, 
I didn't want to fight with you or quarrel, 
so there's a 
good dear, hurry up and come to bed; and tell me darl-
ing— 
Where have you., etc. 
SHOOT THE HAT. 
As sung by TONY PASTOR. 
Air.—Immenseikom 
STRANGE sayings now are all the gq, 
Wherever you may be, 
I 
don't know how it is with you, 
But ' Us the case with me, 
Whatever kind of hat I 
wear, 
Let it be long or fiat, 
Same urchin in the street is sure 
To sing out, " shoot the hat." 
CHORUS. 
Shoot the beaver; shoot the hat, 
It makes a 
fellow look like a 
flat, 
Go where you will, you're sure that 
Some one wql sing out, " shoot the hat. 
To a 
fancy ball 1 
went one night 
With my sweetheart Sarah Jane, 
Determined for to cut a 
dash 
In my best hat and cane, 
When on the road an Irishman, 
I 
think his name was Pat ; 
Said, " Joe, dear friend, if I 
was you, 
foe tAkca and shoot that hat." 
Shoot the beaver, &a. 
I 
went one night Just for a 
walk 
Down — 
street I 
strayed, 
Of that by word to rid myself, 
For a 
new hat there I 
paid, 
At 
famous hat store ' twos, 
The latest st:,-le that's out, 
I'd scarcely got outside the door, 
When boys began to shout: 
Shoot the beaver, etc. 
So now my friends, my song is done, 
I 
will no longer talk ; 
But say good night unto you all, 
.So now my chalks I'll walk; 
Before 
go I'll ask of you 
A 
favor, which is, that 
it you should meet me in the street, 
Please don't shout shoot that hat, 
Shoot the beaver, etc. 
Of all the strangest girls on earth, 
I 
think my girl's the one; 
You know she has peculiar ways,. 
And quite devoid of fun. 
She never sees a 
joke of mine, 
Whenever humor flows, 
But gives me a 
disdainful look 
And quite turns up her nose. 
SPOKEN—Some girls like a 
little joke, you know, but mine 
don't, she turns her nose up at it. 
I 
think she works it on 
the same principle as this (turning up nose with finger). 
CHORUS. 
Some girls do, and some girls don't, 
Some girls will, but my girl won't ; 
I 
tried very hard to see if she would, 
She said she really couldn't, and I 
don't think she could. 
I 
took my love to see the play, 
As other fellahs do ; 
And thought that she'd enjoy herself, 
She cried the whole night through. 
And when we reached the street again, 
Some oysters I 
proposed, 
But she said, " No, not me, young man," 
Still turning up her nose. 
SPOKEN— Up it went again at three dozen of the best 
Saddle Rocks, just think of that. 
To see a 
girl turn up her 
nose at five cents a 
time. 
I 
sajd, " Well, my love, if you 
47 
won't have any supper, we will have a 
cab and go home." 
She replied, " No, young man, no four-wheeled cabs for me 
at this time of night." 
Some girls do, 8c.o. 
We met one Sunday afternoon, 
For a 
day in Central Park; 
And when we mounted " One tree bill" 
We had, well, say a 
lark ! 
'Georgina said, " You know, young man, 
Some girls prefer a 
stroll; 
Not me, when I'm in Central Park 
I 
dearly love a 
roll!" 
SPOKEN—Now, there's an extraordinary girl for you. 
Of 
course, I 
wanted to take her for a 
nice quiet lover's walk in 
some shady lane, but she said she'd prefer a 
roll. 
Then I 
wanted to talk to her of love, romance, and poetry, but no, 
she said she'd " sooner have a 
good dinner." 
Well, 
Not long ago my uncle died 
And left me fifty pounds; 
As soon as I 
received the news 
My joy it knew no bounds. 
I 
thought, well, I 
will marry now, 
So I 
at once proposed; 
But when I 
mentioned the amount 
Up went her lovely nose. 
SPOKEN—The bad girl, she said she ought to have five 
hundred with such a 
man as me. I 
thought she would have 
jumped at me, you know, for, 
Some girls de, Stc.

STOKES' VERDICT. 
Written and sung by W ILLIAM J. 
SCANLON. 
Ain.—"Never Go Back on the Poor." 
If you '11 listen awhile, I'll sing you a 
song 
About this "glorious land of the free," 
And the " difference" I'll show ' twixt the rich and the poor, 
In a " trial by the jury," you see. 
If you've plenty of " stamps," you can hold up your head, 
And walk out from your own prison door, 
But they ' 11 hang you up high if you ' ve no friends or gold---
Let the " rich" go, but hang up the poor! 
CHORUS. 
In the trials for murder we ' ve had now- a- days 
The rich ones get off swift and 'sure, 
While they ' ve thousands to pay to the jury and judge, 
You can bet they'll go back on the poor! 
Let me speak of a 
man who s 
now dead in his grave---
A good man as ever was born--
Jim Fisk, he was called, and his money he gave 
To the outcast the poor and forlorn. 
We all know he loved both women and wine, 
But his heart it was right, I 
am sure; 
Though he lived like a "prince" in a 
palace so fine, 
Yet he never went back on the poor! 
CHORUS. 
If a 
man was in trouble, Fisk helped him along 
To drive the " grim wolf" from the door ; 
He strove to do right, though be may have done wrong, 
But he never went back on the poor! 
Jim Fisk was a 
man, wore his heart on his sleeve," 
No matter what people would say, 
And he did all his deeds ( both the good and the bad) 
in the broad open light of the day, 
r 
49 
[SZOKEe VERDICT.--- Continued.] 
With his grand " six-in-hand" on the beach at Long Branch, 
He cut a " big dash" to be sure, 
But " Chicago's great fire" showed the world that Jim risk, 
With his " wealth," still remembered the poor? 
CHORUS. 
When the telegram came that the homeless that night 
Were starving to death, slow but sure, 
His " Lightning Express," manned by noble Jim Fisk, 
Flew to feed all her hungry and poor! 
Now what do you think of this " trial" of Stokes, 
Who murdered this .
faiond of the poor? 
When such men get frcs,e, is there anyone safe 
If they step from outci(c their own door? 
Is there one law for the Tloor and one for the rich? 
It seems so, at len5.t so I 
say; 
If they hang up the : oor, 'why—damn it!--thc rich

0 WHISPER while we tell to you 
A 
story that is short and thrue,, 
The rayson why we had to go 
Across the raging water. 
The British army we did jine, 
They 'listed us for twelve years time, 
And thought they had us very fine, 
But we skipped across the water. 
CHORUS. 
Shug a 
roog, a 
roog, sting, 
Shug a 
roog a 
roo, 
Shugar in the tay-pot, 
How are you ? 
Away on the big ship we did go. 
Across the raging water. 
We liked the army well enough, 
But rations there were very tough, 
They fed us on salt junk and duff, 
And stirabout and water. 
They put us in a 
coat of red, 
With a 
waivin' plume upon our bead— 
We often wished that we were dead, 
Or drownded in the water. 
Shug a 
roog, a 
roog, shug, 
They made us swear to sarve the Queen, 
They took from us our coat of green, 
They took our ould dudeens away, 
And threw them in the water. 
Then we resolved to take Frinch lave, 
For liberty we did s 
rely grieve, 
The British guard we did desave, 
And skipped across the water. 
Shoog a 
roog, a 
roog, slug, tie. 
And now we're in Amerikay, 
We do our wo..c and get our pay, 
And many's the time we've blessed the day. 
We skipped across the water. 
The stars and stripes are o'er our head, 
The green does wave above the red, 
And British laws no more we dread, 
Since we're across the water. 
Shoog a 
roog, a 
roog, shug, 
A 
Contradiction. 
" 
The mill will never grind again 
With the water that has past." 
A maxim of the olden time 
That will forever last. 
This theme, in verses written, 
Preaches a 
sermon to all; 
But critically weighed with wisdom, 
How does the lesson fall ? 
The mIll upon a 
slope doth stand, 
It bears an antique shape; 
Waters from the mountain-land 
Seem happy to escape, 
And, rushing by the old mill's wheel, 
Causing it to grind. 
Bound madly on the vale beyond, 
A 
level there to find. 
The race now o'er, with calmness 
Into a 
lake the water flows, 
And, mingling with the tranquil flood, 
Seeks peace in sweet repose. 
The bright sunbeams then visiting 
This realm to Somnus given, 
The tiny globes in vapors rise 
To space above in heaven. 
Once in air, they congregate, 
Fantastic clouds to be, 
And, wafted by the summer breeze, 
Float off most gracefully. 
Soon the mountain tops are reached, 
Ere they cling for rest ; 
Each rugged peak is hid from view, 
Each in vapor dressed. 
At morn the clouds would fain ascend, 
And leave this dreary plain ; 
But, chilled through by the frigid air, 
Condensed, they fall in rain. 
As the pearly drops alight, 
They dance about with glee, 
For are they not of earth again, 
Just as they used to be ? 
They prance, they skip, and race along, 
O'er pebbled brook and rill— 
When lo! they reach familiar ground, 
And pass the same old mill. 
In doing so they turn the wheel, 
With sparkling spray o'ercast, 
Thus proving that the mill does grind 
With water that has past. 
Philosophically the lesson's taught, 
Bidding us beware, 
Although a 
chance unheeded pass, 
Not to incite despair. 
Labor on with redoubled zeal, 
Lost hours to redeem, 
And teacn your conscience thus to feel, 
That things are what they seem. 
Opportunities appearing lost, 
And numbered with the slain, 
By providential agencies 
Will surely come again. 
Now bear in mind, although the Fates 
Your hopes continually blast, 
Kind Nature's mill will grind agaus 
With watei that has past.

We've a

And straw feathers as well, 
And we are the proprietors 
Of the Mrs. McGee's Hotel.

We give them yellow Ingin meal; 
With corned beef and cabbage 
We give them once a 
day ; 
And a 
red herring every night, 
They must have for their tea. 
Roast beef and turkey 
We give them once a

And that's about Christmas time, 
When them things they are not dear. 
With pigshead and potatoes, 
And a 
little ale as well, 
That's the way we treat our boarders 
At the Mrs. McGee's Hotel. 
Ffileore Verse. 
We have boarders from all nations, 
From high and low stations, 
From the rag picker down 
To the shabby genteel. 
We have tinkers and tailors, 
Junk men and junk dealers ; 
Sure they all of them are striving 
For to raise a 
square meal. 
There's big Paddy Burke,

By ED. HARRIGA.N. 
With calm deliberation, 
Without any hesitation, 
I'll give a 
recitation 
Of the Rue de Mulberry. 
From every Gothic winder, 
You can observe its splinder, 
'Tis my duty to defind her— 
The Rue de Mulberry. 
Its buildings are tremendous, 
The population is stupendous, 
The citizens conscientious— 
In the Rue de Mulberry. 
Men from Italiana 
Play harps and the planner, 
In a 
Lazercner manner, 
In the Rue de Mulberry. 
Policemen from headquarters, 
Watch Italy's fair daughters. 
And the lager- beer importers— 
In the Rue de Mulberry. 
You could hear an Irish lecturo, 
From the neighbors living next yer. 
In the splendid architecture 
Of the Rue de Mulberry. 
For pugilistic demonstration, 
Of men from every nation, 
The only real location 
Is the Rue de Mulberry. 
'Tis there the solid voters 
Eat eels and Yarmouth bloaters, 
And wear piccadilly chokers— 
In the Rue de Mulberry. 
The perfume of the flowers, 
In the bucket shops and bowers, 
Waft their fragrance at all hours, 
In the Rue de Mulberry. 
For vast accumulation 
Of a 
mighty aggregation, 
No other congregation 
Equals Rue de Mulberry. 
On Sundays, then, the ladies, 
Taking out their day days, 
With a 
hundred million babies. 
In the Rue de Mulberry.

GIVE THE WORKINGMAN A 
CHANCE. 
As originally sung by W ILL H. 
MORTON, at Howard Atheneum, 
Boston, Mass. 
Some boast of wealth and riches, but give me the hardy hand, 
Give me the honest workingman, the pride of every land; 
The man that earns his living by the sweat of labor's brow, 
That wields the axe, the pick, the spade, or stands behind the 
plough. 
I 
love the sons of manly toil, they built up our success, 
And made a 
mighty nation of this western wilderness; 
Unto our bright protecting stars they nobly did advance, 
For well they knew our flag would give each workingman a 
chance. 
They spanned the mighty prairie, they enriched the American 
soil, 
They built each railroad in the land, these sons of hardy toil; 
In vain did other climes compete, our vessels swept the sea, 
For labor w. s 
our bond of strength, bright labor, strong and 
free. 
I 
envy not the titled lord, nor yet the man of wealth, 
I'd rather have the sinews strong, that tinge of ruddy health, 
That labor gives to all her sons whose watchword is advance, 
What made our great success—we gave our workingman a 
chance. 
Let England send her hardy sons, to them we'll give the hand, 
We can't forget that Washington sprang from the mother:and, 
Let Germany her thousands send, to leave their sunny Rhine, 
And Russia, from her icy plains, in countless thousands join. 
Let Ireland send each manly form, no tyrant here does stand, 
A welcome sweet we'll give to all in our bright Western land, 
Come from the home of Lafayette— the sunlit hills of France, 
For ' tis our greatest joy to give each workingman a 
chance.

The N. Y. Evening Mail writes0 
" 
A 
Little Book has lately appeared in print at Mr. A. J. FisnEa's, 95 ITas 
sau street, called the " Little Flirt." We 
cannot say that we recommend 
it to our young lady and gentlemen readers, as we think it would only 
encourage the bad habit of " flirting." 
Unfortunately, there is enough 
of it done without any furtherr ecessity of explaining "how, when and 
where to do it," and this little volume would advise and initiate the un-
corrupted in practicing what is commonly called 
flirting." 
The N. Y. Evening Telegram writes; " We have lately seen a 
neat tfttle 
book, bound in Morocco leather, costing twenty-five cents, called the 
"Little Flirt," published by A. J. FISHER, No. 98 Nassau Street. 
It 
gives information of the modus operandi of flirting, and of the mean-
ing of every motion of the handkerchief, fan, glove and parasol. As 
there is nothing at all objectionable in the volume, and its contents 
might afford some innocent amusement to many, we do not hes itate to 
recommend it to our young lady and gentlemen readers."

monds and Spades—and each of these into K for King, Q for Queen, 
mad K 
for Knave, and numbers 1, 3, to 70. 
The Cares are arranged in 
four rows, and are to be read according to directions. 
Many of the an-
swers depend upon the position certain cards bear to other cards. Toe 
method of playing is somewhat complicated, but the directions have 
been made so that very little study will suffice to an ordinary under-
standing.

or;o111•1. lug Cards.—This Series of Cards has been arranged 
to meet a 
want frequently felt by young people—a 
want of means of 
expressing one's sentiments in such o, way as to be non-cmiamittaL 
Many young ladies are visited by 
-_
Alemen who are either too diffi-
dent or too fearful of a 
repulse, to venture upon asking the momentous 
question. 
The lady is restrained, by custom and a 
sense of propriety, 
from doing anything that would seem to be an unladylike encou rage-
rnent. 
As a 
result of this dilemma, many lives are spent as an unloved 
tedious existence, which might have been prolonged and enjoyed in the 
happiness of matrimony. 
This pack of Cards will overcome the diftl. 
culty, and being in the shape of questions and answers, will cover every 
phase of courtship. 
Tie sentiments conveyed therein need not be 
adopted by the parties to the game as their own, unless it accords with 
the state of their affections, which fact makes a 
further explanation un-
necessary. The playin of these Cards is not restricted to two players, 
bat may be enjoyed by evening parties
