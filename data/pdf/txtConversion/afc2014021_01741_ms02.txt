INTERVIEW LOG
Nargiza Turanova Interview 
00:30:09
00:00:00  Consent to interview.  My name is Nargiza Turanova.  I have lived in Portland for the 
last 9 years.  Working 6 years with this client.  I work mainly with sick, elderly clients.
 
00:01:40  What led you to be a home care worker?  Always interested in this kind of work.  
When I came to US, I took English classes, and when my English was better, I talked to friends, 
did research, and found the job in home care.
00:02:38  Other jobs? First when I came here, I worked at a local hotel.  I began to wonder about
other jobs, including the one I have now.  Always interested in this kind of work, went to internet
and found this job.
00:04:15  How is home care different than other jobs? I like to work with people, the 
communication, and I like being helpful.  I used to see elderly and think, why wouldn’t I help 
them?
00:05:19  Skills needed? First of all, you must know the specifics of this job, and like what you 
are doing before you start doing it, and it is hard work.
00:06:01  How did you learn? I learned in my own country.  Lots of elderly and helpless people 
around the neighborhood. I would stop by the neighbors and help them, doing it out of goodwill. 
Did you take classes here?  Yes, of course, and I keep taking the classes. And I went to the 
meeting in Salem.  Already knew a lot?  Yes, because I go online and read about my work, I want
to know more about the job I am doing and how to do it right.
00:07:43  Typical day? Goes through a typical day:  If they have plans, I accompany them, 
arrange it.  A walk, a doctor appointment, shopping, lunch, bath 3x a week.  Laundry.  I clean, 
freshen up the bedroom and bath.  How many clients? One, I go every day.

00:10:00  I am not that good at English, my client speaks Turkish, which is my language, not 
Russian.  Have clients that don’t speak Turkish or Russian? No, that would be difficult.
00:11:04  Do you become close to the client?  Yes, we have to find a common language.  Hard on
the rest of your life?  Yes.  This is my job, but I also have a family.  Do you need to set 
boundaries?  No.  I am always happy to help.
00:14:25  Intimate tasks, how approach?  (Explain what I mean by intimate, bathing, toilet.) 
Always do with an open heart, I do whatever is in their interest to never hurt or harm them.  I am 
never repulsed or disgusted.
00:16:33  Story?  My client likes music, so I find music that lifts her up, if she is in a good mood,
I am in a good mood.
  
00:17:45  What do home care workers talk about when together?  About the job, are they 
working or not, do I like my job or not.
00:18:50  Music important. Sense of humor important too.  When my client goes to an 
appointment, she is an entertainment for both of us.  She is really is a really good person and an 
entertaining person even though she is 79.
00:20:11  What is rewarding?  I really find the communication and spending time together 
rewarding.  She is a very happy person, times flies because she is a happy person.
00:21:05  Challenging?  To have time with your own family and do the work.  But now doing so 
well I don’t notice the shift back and forth between them.
00:21:58  Union? I am very happy to have the union, I feel very protected, always get answers to
questions.  Thank you to them; and you for being interested in us.
00:23:06  Lobby days? In 2013, went to a meeting in Salem, we talked, happy to be there.
00:24:50  One thing you want people to know about the job?  Some friends of mine have very 
sick clients, so that they cannot take part in anything.  I try and bring them the information about 
the union.  They ask me and I share.
00:26:05  What do you do when not working? I have family, we go places, and I offer to take 
them to see my client.  So they know where do I work and what do I do.  Have you done this?  
Yes.  How old are they?  20 and 16, and they have visited my client.

00:27:17 Anything else?   No, you asked all the questions.
00:27:43  I am impressed that you speak Turkish and Uzbek and Russian and some English.  She
tells her immigration path: family from Turkey, lived in Uzbekistan, then Russia, where she went
to school, then here as a refugee.  At first, no English, worked with volunteers to learn, and I 
practiced at the hotel.
00:30:09  End of interview.
