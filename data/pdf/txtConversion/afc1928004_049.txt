Tim Finigan lived in Walker Street, 
5i 
A 
gentleman Irishman, mighty odd, 
52 
He'd a 
beautiful brogue, so rich and sweet, 
And to rise in the world, he carried the hod. 
But, you see, he'd a 
sort of a 
tipling way: 
54 
With a 
love for liquor poor Tim was born; 
And, to help him through his work, each day, 
He'd a 
drop of the creatur' every morn'. 
CHORUS.

TIM FINIGAN'S WAKE 
SONGSTER. 
•••••••••••••••••••••••••• 
Tim Finigan's Wake. 
Ain—" The French Musician." 
One morning, Tim was rather full ; 
His head felt heavy, which made him shake ; 
He fell from the ladder, and broke his skull, ' 
So, they carried him home, his corpse to wake. 
They rolled him up in a 
nice clean sheet, 
And laid him out upon the bed, 
With fourteen candles around his feet, 
And a 
couple of dozen around his head.

6 Tim Finigan's Wake Songster. 
His friends assembled at his wake : 
Missus Pinigan called out for the lunch, , 
First, they laid in tay and cake ; 
Then, pipes and tobacky, atid whiskey-punch. 
Miss Biddy O'Brien began to cry: 
Such a 
purty corps did ever you see ? 
Arrah ! Tim avourneen, an' why did ye die ? 
Och, none of your gab, sez Judy Magee. 
Whack, hurrah, &c. 
Then Peggy O'Connor took up the job: 
Arrah ! Biddy, says she, ye're wrong, I'm sure 
But Judy, then, gave her a 
belt on the gob, 
And left her sprawling on the fliire. 
Each side in the war did soon engage: 
'Twas woinan to woman, and than to man ; 
Shillalah-law was all the rage, 
An' a 
bloody ruption soon began. 
Whack, hurrah, &c. 
Mickey Mulvaney raised his head, 
When a 
gallon of whiskey flew at him: 
It missed him—and, hopping on the bed 
The liquor scattered over Tim ! 
Bedad ! he revives I 
see how he raises! 
An' Timothy, jumping from the bed, 
Cries, while he lathered around like blazus: 
Bad luck till yer souls ! d'ye think I'm dead 2. 
Whack, hurrah, &c, 
Pat Malloy. 
At sixteen years of age, I 
was my mother's fair-
hair'd boy; 
She kept a 
little buster shop, her name it was 
Malloy.

But childer aint like pigs, you know; they can't 
pay the rent ? 
She gave me every shilling there was in the till, 
And kissed me fifty times or more, as if she'd never 
get her fill: 
Oh! Heaven bless you! Pat, says she, and don't 
forget, my boy, 
That Ould Ireland is your Country, and your name 
is Pat Malloy ! 
Oh! England is a 
purty place; of goold there is 
no lack, 
I 
trudged from York to London wid me scythe 
upon me back. 
The English girls are beautiful, their loves I 
don't 
decline ; 
The eating and the drinking, too, is beautiful and 
fine; 
But in a 
corner of my heart, which nobody can 
see, 
Two eyes of Irish blue are always peeping out at 
me! 
0, Molly darlin', never fear: I'm still your own 
dear boy, 
Ould Ireland is me Country, and me name is Pat 
Malloy 1 
From Ireland to America, across the seas, I 
roam: 
And every shilling that I 
got, ah 
sure I 
sent it 
home. 
Mu mother couldn't write, but, oh I 
there came 
from Father Boyce: 
Oh l 
Heaven bless you! Pat, says she, I 
hear me 
mother's voice 
But, now, I'm going home again, as poor as I 
began, [can; 
To make a 
happy girl of Moll, and sure I 
think I 
Me pockets they are empty, but me heart is fill'd 
wid joy ; 
For, Ould Ireland is me Country, and me name is 
Pat Malloy.

Return of Pat Malloy. 
When landed safe in Dublin-town, I 
met a 
castle 
hack: 
The boots upon my feet he eyed, and the clothes 
upon my back. 
He says: You're from America, look so neat and 
trim ; 
Just let me see your letters, Sir. 
I 
handed one to 
him. 
He says: It's from O'Mahony. And, says I, you 
fanny elf, 
It's a 
letter for my own sweet Moll LI'm taking 
home myself. 
He says: You are a 
Fenian. 
Says I: 
You're 
right, old boy; 
For Ould Ireland is my country, and my name 
is Pat Malloy. 
He had me then examined, and he says: My nice 
young man, 
What brought you home to Ireland ? 
Was it the 
Fenian plan ? 
The ship it brought me home, says I, and Fenians 
' all agree 
That from sweet Athlone to Blarney- Stone Ould 
Ireland shall be free ; 
But was it not for Molly's eyes that's sticking in my 
heart, 
An me Mother an the childer, too, oh, sure, they 
had their part ! 
I'll take them to America, and then look out, my 
boy: 
For, Otild Ireland is my country, and my name is 
Pat Malloy. 
But when I 
met my Molly dear, she kissed me o'er 
and o'er; 
She could not laugh for crying, as I 
gave her 
goold galore.

It's your own, my dearest Molly: for I 
knew you 
would prove true; 
Every pound I 
sent my mother, I 
put by two for 
you; 
And now you have the shiners, Moll, and will you 
take myself ? 
She blushed and whispered : yes dear Pat, I'm 
yours, but not for pelf. 
We got my mother's blessing, and it filled my 
heart with joy : 
For, Ould Ireland is my country, and my name is 
Pat Molloy. 
Early the next morning sure, we went to Father 
Boyce: 
That RIB says he, wid a 
wink at me, it is a 
purty 
choice. 
And mighty strong it is says I, my heart, sure, 
knows it best ; 
Three years or more, with thumps galore, she 
made it thrash my breast; 
These eyes are mighty killing, Sir ; but now they 
are my own. 
For four long years, when far from home, they 
made me cry : och, hone 
And now I 
ask your blessing, Sir, for to complete 
my joy; 
For, Ould Ireland is my country, and my name is 
Pat Malloy. 
Now my Mother's in her rocking-chair, her childer 
pay the rent, 
In New York, relieved from work, each happy 
hour is spent ; 
And, free from every toil and care, her heart is 
light and free ; 
She sings a 
good old Irish song, with young Pat on 
her knee : 
And Molly, lovely Molly, sure, she is her heart's 
delight—

For, he was born in Ould Ireland, and his name is 
Pat Malloy. 
The Last Rose of Summer. 
'Tis the last rose of summer 
Left blooming alone; 
All her lovely companion's 
Are faded and gone; 
No flower of her kindred, 
No rosebud is nigh, 
• 
To reflect back her blushes 
Or give sigh for sigh. 
I'll not leave thee, thou lone one, 
To pine on thy stem 
Since the lovely are sleeping, 
Go, sleep thou with them; 
Thus kindly I 
scatter 
Thy leaves o'er the bed, 
Where thy mates of the garden 
Lie scentless and dead. 
So soon may I 
follow, 
When friendships decay, 
And from love's shining circle 
The gems drop away I 
'When true hearts lie wither'd, 
And fond ones are flown, 
Oh! who would inhabit 
This bleak world alone!

The Lover of Seventy-two. 
A 
lover of seventy-two, 
Who felt quite a 
boy, full of vigor, 
And besides being rich as a 
Jew 
Could boast of an excellent figure; 
Once thought that his riches could tempt 
The heart of a 
maid young and tender, 
For, thou rlit he, there's no woman exempt 
From the homage to riches they render; 
But somehow, as 'twas in his case, 
His riches it was proved his ruin, 
A 
thing that's quite apt to take place 
When a 
silly old man goes a 
wooing._ 
There lived in a 
cottage close by 
A 
lady with one lovely daughter, 
A widow she was, by the bye, 
Who of hearts in her time had made slaughter; 
Their names were alike, the old beau 
To the maiden sent presents and letters, 
To mamma dear, this missy did show, 
(Young, girls should be ruled by their betters) 
"I'll answer the note," said the dame, 
For widows know what they are doing, 
And a 
day or two after he came 
To the house of the widow a 
wooing. 
The maiden she thought it good fun, 
The old beau he soon found what hope meant; 
The widow looked grave as a 
nun, 
So the gallant proposed an elopement; 
The licence procured, it took place, 
'T was so dark they could not see each other, 
Till, removing the veil front her face, 
lie found he had married the mother. 
So old men of widows beware, 
And be certain of what you are doing, 
Or you may have a 
daughter to spare 
When you go to the widow's a 
wooing.

BY SAMUEL LOVER. 
Our Father-land! and wouldst thou know 
Why we should call it Father-land ? 
It is, that Adam here below, 
Was made of earth by Nature's hand; 
And he, our father, made of earth, 
Hath peopled earth on ev'ry hand, 
And we, in memory of his birth, 
Do call our country, " Father-land." 
At first, in Eden's bowers, they say, 
No sound of speech had Adam caught, 
But whistled like a 
bird all day— 
And may be, ' twas for want of thought: 
But Nature, with resistless laws, 
Made Adam soon surpass the birds, 
She gave him lovely Eve—because 
If he'd a 
wife— they must hare words, 
And so, the NATIVE LAND I 
hold 
By male descent is proudly mine; 
The LANGUAGE, as the tale bath told, 
Was given in the female line. 
And thus, we see, on either hand, 
We name our blessings whence they've sprung 
We call our country FATHER-land, 
We call our language MortrEn,tongue. 
Dermot Astore. 
Oh! Dermot astore! between waking and sleeping, 
I 
heard thy dear voice, and I 
wept to its lay; 
Every pulse of my heart the sweet measure was 
keeping, 
Till Killarney's wild echoes had borne it away.

Shall we wander no more in Killarney's green

To watch the bright sun o'er the dim hills' re-
treating, 
And the wild stag at rest in his bed of spring 
flowirs ? 
Oh 1 
Dermot 4store, &c. 
Oh! Dermot astore! how this fond heart would 
flutter, 
When I 
met thee by night in the shady boreen, 
And heard thine own voice in a 
soft whisper utter 
Those words of endearment, " Mavourneen cal-
leen 1" 
I 
know we must part, but, oh! say not for ever, 
That it may be for years adds enough to my 
pain; 
But I'll cling to the hope, that though now we 
must sever, 
In some blessed hour I 
shall meet thee again. 
Oh 1

A Perilous Thing is the Blarney. 
Oh when a 
young bachelor wooes a 
young maid. 
Who's eager to go, and yet willing to stay, 
She sighs and she blushes, and looks half-afraid, 
But loses no word that her lover can say: 
What is it she hears but the blarney—the blarney ? 
Oh ! a 
perilous thing is the blarney I 
To all that he tells her she gives no reply, 
Or murmurs and whispers so gentle and low;, 
And though he has ask'd her when nobody's by,. 
She dare not say "Yes," and she cannot say "No,"

Oh! a

But people get used to a 
perilous thing, 
And fancy the sweet words of lovers are true ; 
So let all their blarney be pushed through a

Then maids have no fear of the blarney—the

The Dying Soldier; or, One of the Rank 
and File. 
'Twas a 
glorious day, worth a 
warrior's telling, 
Two kings had fought, and the fight was done, 
When amidst the shouts of victory swelling, 
A 
soldier fell on the field he had won. 
He thought of kings and royal quarrels, 
And thought of glory without a 
smile— 
For what had he to do with laurels, 
IIe was only one of the rank and file. 
But drawing his little cruiskeen, 
He drank to his pretty colleen, 
" 
Oh! darling," said he, " If I 
die, 
You won't be a 
widow, for why ? 
Sure you would never have me, mavourneen." 
Then a 
raven tress from his bosom taking, 
That now was stain'd with his life stream shed, 
A 
fervent prayer on that ringlet making, 
He blessings sought on the loved one's head. 
And visions fair of his native mountains 
Arose enchanting his fading sight, 
Her emerald valleys and crystal fountains, 
Were never shining more clear and bright. 
But grasping his little cruiskeen, 
He pledged that dear Island so green :— 
" 
Though. far from thy valleys I 
die, 
Dearest Isle of my heart, thou art nigh, 
As though absent I 
never had been." 
A 
tear now fell, for as life was sinking, 
The pride that guarded his manly eye 
Had weaker grown, and such tender .thinking 
Brought heaven and home and his true -love 
nigh. 
But, with the fire of his gallant nation, 
He scorned surrender without a 
blow; 
He met death with capitulation, 
And with warlike honors he still would go.

soldier as ever was seen.

My name is William Simmonds, I'm a 
gardener by 
trade, 
Served seven years in one situation, 
I 
first lost my heart then threw away my spade, 
Oh, listen to my long lamentation. 
Oh my ! the world is now to me, 
A 
garden of great desolation, 
I'm a 
stem without a 
flower since I 
lost my Mary 
Ann. 
And left in a

Will you take a

I've been down to Morisianna to look for Mary 
Ann, 
And returned in a

Her father was a 
baker and her mother was a

As fast and far it sail'd away, 
With him she loved the best, 
A 
dark foreboding day by day 
Sank o'er that maiden's breast. 
The summer went; the winter came, 
That maiden's heart grew weary; 
Yet day by day she stood the same, 
Watching those waters dreary. 
One eve—Oh! 'twas a 
fearful one !— 
She saw a 
helpless bark; 
She watch'd it till the sun went down, 
And all, and all was dark. 
That night upon a 
reef 'twas dash'd, 
One shriek, and all was over : 
A 
lifeless form on shore was wash'd,— 
It was that maiden's lover. 
A 
cry was heard that dark, dark night, 
Above the wild waves' roar ; 
That maiden, with the morning's light, 
Lay cold upon the shore.

That danc'd o'er the silver tide. 
But his heart was young and his spirit light, 
And he dashed the tear away, 
As he watch'd the shore recede from sight, 
Of his own sweet Dublin Bay. 
Three days they sail'd, and a 
storm arose, 
And the lightning swept the deep, 
And the thunder-crash broke the short repose 
Of the weary sea-boys' sleep.

Love My Love In The Morning. 
BY GERALD GREFFIN. 
I 
love my love in the morning, 
For she, like morn, is fair— 
Her blushing cheek, its crimson streak, 
Its clouds, her golden hair ; 
Her glance, its beam, so soft and kind; 
Her tears, its dewy showers ; 
Her voice, the tender whisp'ring wind 
That stirs the early bowers. 
I 
love my love in the morning, 
I 
love my love at noon, 
For she is bright, as the lord of light, 
Yet mild as autumn's moon; 
Her beauty is my bosom's sun, 
Her faith my fostering shade; 
And I 
will love my darling one 
Till e'en the sun shall fade.

Despair in her wild eye, a

Appear'd on the cliffs of the bleak rocky shore ; 
Loose in the wind

And heedless she gaz'd on the dread surge's

Loud rang her harp in wild tones of despairing; 
The time pass'd away with the present compar-

And in soul-thrilling strains deeper sorrow declar-
ing, 
She sang Erin's woes and her Emmet no more. 
0, Erin my country, your glory's departed ; 
For tyrants and traitors have stabbed thy heart's 
core, 
Thy daughters have laved in the 
streams of 
affliction, 
Thy patriots have fled, or lie stretched in their 
gore. 
Ruthless 
ruffians now prowl thro' thy hamlets 
forsaken, 
From pale hungry orphans their last morsel have 
taken ;

Let Erin Remember. 
Am :—" The Red Fox." 
Let Erin remember the days of old, 
Ere faithless some betray'd her ; 
When Malachi wore the collar of gold, 
Which he won from he proud invader; 
When her king, with standard of green unfurl`d, 
Led the Red Branch knights to danger, 
Ere the emerald gem of the western world 
Was set in the crown of a 
stranger. 
On Lough-Neagh's bank, as the fisherman strays, 
When the clear cold eve's declining, 
He sees the round towers of other days, 
In the wave beneath him shining! 
Thus shall memory often, in dreams sublime, 
Catch a 
glimpse of the days that are over; 
Thus sighing, look through the wave of time, 
For the long-faded glories they cover. 
My Own Native Isle. 
There's an Isle, clasp'd by waves, in an emerald

A youth, whom I 
name not, remembers me 
there.

The Farewell To 2iTy Harp. 
Am :—" New Langolee." 
Dear Harp of my Country! in darkness I 
find 
thee, 
The cold chain of silence had hung o'er thee 
long, 
When proudly, my own island Harp! I 
unbound 
thee, 
And gave all thy chords to light, freedom and 
song 
The warm lay of love, and the light note of glad-
ness, 
Have waken'd thy fondest, thy liveliest thrill ; 
But so oft has thou echoed the deep sigh of sadness, 
That e'en in thy mirth it would steal from thee 
still. 
Dear Harp of my Country! farewell to thy num-
bers, 
This sweet wreath of song is the last we shall 
twine, 
Go,—sleep with the sunshine of 
fame on thy 
slumbers, 
Till touch'd by some hand less unworthy than 
mine. 
If the pulse of the patriot, soldier, or lover, 
have throbb'd at our lay, 'tis thy glory alone: 
I 
was but as the wind, passing heedlessly over, 
And all thy wild sweetness I 
wak'd was my own.

And lovers are round her sighing, 
But coldly she turns from their gaze, and weeps, 
For her heart in his grave is lying! . 
She sings the wild. song . of her dear native plains, 
Ev'ry mite which he loved awaking— 
Alt ! little they think who delight in her strai

He had liv'd for his love, for his country he died, 
They were all that to life had entwin'd him,—

As Shannon's great or pastoral band, 
Or who a

So gen'rous as an Irishman ? 
Tho' his hand be rash, his heart is warm 
And principle is still his guide, 
No more regrets a 
deed of harm, 
No more forgives with nobler pride 
He may be duped, but won't be dared; 
But fit to practise and to plan, 
He. ably earns his true reward, 
And spends it like an Irishman. 
If poor in weal, he'll for you pay. 
And guide you where you safe may be*, 
If you're his comrade, whilst you stay, 
His cottage holds a 
jubilee ; 
His inmost soul he will unlock, 
And if he may your merits scan, 
Your confidence be scornato mock; 
For faithful is an Irishman. 
By honor bound in WO or weal, 
Whate'er she bids he dares to do, 
Try him with gold, it won't prevaif, 
But e'en in fire you'll find him true 1,

Be where there's aught in danger's ran, 
Or if the field of fame be lost, 
It won't be by an Irishman.

Lord, lord, thinks I, what ails me ? 
Al I 
what's the matter now ? 
The question soon was answer'd— 
Sly Cupid's dart was thrown, 
I 
lov'd as well as Paddy ; 
But I 
would not own: 
For if he talked of dying, 
Or mourned his hapless case, 
I 
seldom fail'd replying, 
By laughing in his face; 
Oh, dear! oh, dear! oh, dear 1 
At length his patience failing, 
Ile proudly swore he'd go; 
Not yet, said I, half smiling— 
Why, what's the matter now ? 
He slily seized that moment, 
To press me to be his; 
And how it was I 
know not, 
I 
thoughtless answered " yes." 
Oh, then, when first we married, 
How easily I 
reig,rn'd ; 
If check'd, my point I 
carried, 
By sobs and tears well feign'd

Paddy's Dream; or, The English, Irish, and 
Scotchman. 
John Bull he was an Englishman, 
And went on tramp one day, 
With three-pence in his pocket, 
To take him a 
long way; 
He tramped along for miles and miles, 
Yet no one did he see, 
Till he fell in with an Irishman, 
Whose name was Paddy McGee. 
" 
Good morning, Pat," said John to him. 
" 
Where are you going to V' 
Says Paddy, " I 
hardly know myself, 
I 
want a 
job to do." 
"Have you got any money about you ?" 
Said John Bull unto Pat, 
" 
It's the only thing I'm wanting, 
For I 
hav'nt got a 
rap." 
Then they overtook a 
Scotchman, 
Who was like them out of work, 
To judge by his looks he was hard-up, 
And as hungry as a 
Turk. 
" 
Can you lend me a 
shilling, Scotty ?" 
At last said Paddy McGee, 
" 
I'm sorry I 
canna," said the Scothman, 
" 
For I 
lice na got a 
baubee." 
Said the Englishman, " I 
threepence have 
What shall we do with that 'C' 
" 
Och, buy threepen'orth of whisky, 
" 
It will cheer us up," said Pat: 
" 
Nay, dinna do that," said the Scothman 
" 
I'll tell thee best to do, 
Just buy threepence worth of oatmeal, 
1'11 make some nice burgoo."

" 
Now I 
think we had better buy a 
loaf," 
The Englishman did say, 
" 
And then in yonder haystack, 
Our hunger sleep away: 
We can get a 
drink of water, 
From yonder purling stream, 
And the loaf shall be his in the morning, 
'Who has the greatest dream." 
The Englishman dreamt by the morning 
Ten million men had been 
For ten years digging a 
turnip up, 
The largest ever seen; 
At last they got the turnip up, 
By working night and day, 
Then it took five million horses, 
This turnip to pull away. 
Said the Scotchman, ' I've been dreaming 
Fifty million men had been 
For fifty years making a 
boiler, 
The largest ever seen." 
" 
What was it for ?" said the Englishman 
Was it made of copper or tin ?" 
" 
It was made of copper," said Scotty. 
" 
To boil your turnip in !" 
" 
Och," said Paddy, I've been dreaming 
An awful great big dream, 
I 
dreamt I 
was in a 
haystack 
By the side of a 
purling stream, ' 
I 
dreamt that you and Scotty was there 
As true as I'm an oaf, 
By the powers, I 
dreamt I 
was hungry, 
So I 
got up and ate the loaf."

The groves of Blarney they look so charming, 
Down by the purlings of sweet silent brooks; 
All graces by posies that spontaneous grow there, 
And planted in order in the rocky nooks. 
'Tis there the daisy and sweet carnation, 
The blooming pink and rose so fair, 
The daffodowndilly, besides the lily, 
Blows that scent the sweet open air. 
'Tis Lady Jeareys that owns this station,_ 
Like Alexander, or Helen fair; 
There's no commander in all the nation 
For regulation could with her compare. 
Such walls surround her, that no nine- pounder 
Could ever plunder her place of strength, 
Till Oliver Cromwell he did her pummel. • 
And made breaches in all her battlements. 
There is a 
cave, where no daylight enters, 
But cats and badgers are for ever bred, 
And moss'd by nature, makes it completer 
Than a 
coach and six or a 
downy bed.

Liberty Tree. 
BY it. T. PAYWE. 
In a 
chariot of light from the regions of day, 
The goddess of Liberty came; 
Ten thousand celestials directed the way, 
And hither conducted the dame. 
A 
fair budding branch from the garden above, 
1Vhere millions on millions agree, 
She brought in her hand as a 
pledge of her love, 
And the plant she nam'd Liberty tree. 
The celestial exotic struck deep in the ground. 
Like a 
native it flourisli'd and bore; 
The fame of its fruit drew the nations around, 
To seek out its peaceable shore. 
Unmindful of names, or distinctions, they came, 
For freemen like brothers agree; 
With one spirit endued, they one friendship pur-
sued. 
And their temple was Liberty Tree. 
Beneath this fair tree, like the patriarchs of old, 
Their bread in contentment they eat, 
Unvex'd with the troubles of silver and gold, 
The cares of the grand and the great ; 
With timber and tar they old England supplied, 
And supported her power on the sea; 
Her battles they fought without getting a 
groat, 
For the honor of Liberty tree. 
But hear, 0 
ye swains, ('tis a 
tale most profane) 
How all the tyrannical powers, 
Kings, Commons, and Lords, are uniting amain, 
To cut down this guardian of ours: 
From the east to the west blow the trumpet to 
arms 
Thro' the land let the sound of it flee; 
Let the far and the near all unite with a 
cheer, 
In defence of our Liberty Tree.

The American Star. 
TUNE :---" Humors of Glen?' 
Come strike the bold anthem, the war-&ogs are 
howling, 
Already they eagerly snuff up their -prey ; 
The red cloud of war o'er our forests is scowling, 
Soft peace spreads her wings, and flies weeping 
away; 
The infants affrighted, cling close to their mothers, 
The youths grasp their swords, for the combat 
prepare; 
While beauty weeps fathers and lovers 'and bro-
thers, 
Who rush to display the American Star. 
Come blow the 
shrill 
bugle—the loud 
drum 
awaken— 
The dread rifle seize—let the cannon deep .roar; 
No heart with pale fear, or faint doubtings be 
shaken, 
No slave's hostile foot leave a 
print on our shore ; 
Shall mothers, wives, daughters, and sisters left 
weeping, 
Insulted by ruffians, be dragg,'d to despair ? 
Oh, no—from the hills the proud eagle comes 
swooping, 
And waves to the brave the American Star. 
The spirits of Washington, Warren, Montgomery, 
Look down from the clouds, with bright aspect 
serene 
Come, soldiers, a 
tear and a 
toast to their memory, 
Rejoicing they'll see us, as they once have been ; 
To us the high boon by the gods has been granted, 
To spread the glad tidings of liberty far, 
Let millions invade us, we'll meet them undaunted, 
And conquer or die by the American Star.

Beneath her oppression and tyranny dying—

Believe me, if all those endearing young charms. 
Which I 
gaze on so fondly to-day, 
Were to change by to-morrow, and fleet in my 
arms, 
Like fairy gifts fading away; 
Thou wouldst still be ador'd, as this moment thou 
art, 
Let thy loveliness fade as it will, 
And around the dear ruin each wish of my heart, 
Would entwine itself verdantly still. 
It is not while beauty and youth are thy own, 
And thy cheeks unprofan'd by a 
tear, 
That the fervor and faith can be known, 
To which time will make thee more dear. 
Oh! the heart that has truly lov'd, never forgets, 
But as truly loves on to the close ; 
As the sunflower turns on her god, when he sets, 
The same look which she turn'd when he rose !

Am:----" The Girl I

As slow our ship her foamy track 
Against the wind was cleaving, 
for trembling pennant still looked back 
To that dear isle 'twas leaving. • 
So loth we part from all we love, 
From all the links that bind us ; 
So turn our hearts where'er we rove, 
To those we've left behind us! 
When, round the bowl, of vanish'd years 
We talk with joyous seeming, 
And smiles that might as well be tears, 
So faint, so sad their beaming ; 
While mem'ry brings us back again 
Each early tie that twin'd us, 
Oh 1 
sweet the cup that circles then 
To those we've left behind us 1 
And when in other climes we meet, 
Some isle or vale enchanting, 
Where all looks flow'ry wild and sweet, 
And nought but love is wanting; 
'We think how great had been our bliss 
If Ileav'n had but assign'd us, 
To live and die in scenes like this, 
With some we've left behind us! 
As travellers oft look back at eve, 
When eastward. darkly going, 
To gaze upon that light they leave 
Still faint behind them glowing_ 
So, when the close of pleasure's day 
To gloom has near consign'd us, 
We turn to catch one fading ray 
Of joy that's left behind us.

It's folly to keep you from going, 
Though faith it's a 
mighty hard ease;

When next I 
shall see your swate face.

Good bye, Mr. Stich-cloth, I'm going to Dover.— 
Was ever poor tailor so fairly done over 
So now she has left me and gone with the sailor,

Why did you go and kill that big blue bottle ? 
They all were handsome children, but his Mother's 
hope and joy. 
Wa8 Tommy Wattle, aged five, a 
darling little 
boy; 
He'd learnt to read and write, and sing his do, re, 
Int sol, fa, 
And though he always crossed his t's he never 
crossed him ma. 
Oh! Master, &c. 
He'd take his powders, minus jam, and went to 
bed at night, 
And never seem'd at all put out when nurse put 
out the light ; 
But children have their weakness, how ever much 
you chide 'em, 
And Tommy's was for killing flies, he never could 
abide 'em. 
Oh ! Master, &c. 
The dragon and the blue-tail'd fly were his especial 
horror, 
And tho' he kill'd one ev'ry day, its brother came 
to-morrow, 
House flies he'd scrunch by hundreds, too, this 
naugltty Tommy Wattle, 
Until one day lie chanced to slay a 
monstrous big 
blue-bottle.

The blue-bottle's the King of flies, as all of you 
may guess, 
A crowning triumph, Tommy thought, this was 
to his success, 
For not a 
single fly appear'd again, I've heard it 
said, 
Until that dreadful night when little Tommy went , 
to bed. 
Oh! Master, &c. 
He'd gone to sleep rejoicing too, that wicked little 
pickle, 
But something settled on his nose, and woke him 
with its tickle ; 
A horrid buzzing noise he heard—the flies had 
come in hosts, 
At least they could not come themselves and so 
they sent their ghosts. 
Oh ! Master, &c. 
Some had no legs, and some no heads, no bodies 
and no wings, 
And Tom repented very much he'd done such 
wicked Clings ; 
They fell upon him, headed by the monstrous big 
blue-tailed bottle, 
And flew away with him—and there's an end to 
Tommy Wattle. 
Oh! Master, &c. 
MORAL. 
Now little children aged four or five, or six or 
eight— 
Don't kill the flies, or you may meet with Tommy 
Wattle's fate, 
The world is big enough for all to.hve in and to 
thrive, 
Then buy a 
penny fly-paper and catch 'em all 
alive 1

Welcome, ever welcome friends, I 
love to see them 
round, 
And who would not be happy when true friendships 
to be found, 
Their gladsome faces wear no mask, their candor 
you behold, • 
I 
love new friends but still give me, the dear, dear 
friends of old. 
Oh! welcome, ever welcome friends, how painful 
'tis to part, 
With those true good and honest friends who'd 
shared their hand and heart, 
There's kindness in their deeds which tell 'tis never 
bought nor sold, 
I 
love new friends but still give me the dear, dear 
friends of old. 
Welcome, ever welcome friends, who would not 
have them near, 
Tho' age may alter, yet old friends are ever, ever 
dear, 
But when we miss them one by one, and they're no 
more and cold, 
New friends we meet, still mem'ry's dear to those 
lov'd ones of old.

To assist in your rights and laws, 
To rectify the slips and flaws 
You often meet from mar. 
First you can't be too particular in all you say and 
do, 
Put down just half of what man says to be true, 
Another maxim bear in mind, 
Don't be too distant or too kind, 
Be not to your own feeling blind, 
But still beware of man. 
If men flatter, vow and swear, 
Affect the pangs of deep despair, 
Girls of such a 
man beware, 
Let this be your plan. 
Laugh at all he does and says, 
Vow you detest such childish ways, _ 
With all your judgment scan, 
If he have true love, he will throw these airs aside, 
If he's all deception you gall and wound his pride, 
If this should answer in the end, 
You gain the lover and a 
friend, 
Or else a 
rogue and fool offend, 
But still beware of man. 
Girls if a 
simile I 
try, 
Which you may see with half an eye, 
To true love don't the truth deny, 
Don't be slow and shy. 
While you're angling for man, 
Take all art and skill in plan, 
Hook the gudgeon while you can, 
And your judgment ply. 
Always let yourselves be sought, 
Men prize love best that's dearly bought, 
And are like gudgeons easily caught, ", 
If well you lay your plan. 
Your lines and hooks in order keep, 
Some fish swim shallow, some swim deep, 
The trout is tickled while asleep, 
And so it is with man.

I'm Only Bridesmaid After All. 
And so he has wedded another, 
To-day he has made her his bride : 
My feelings I 
tried hard to smother, 
As I 
foolishly knelt by her side. 
For often he vow'd he ador'd me, 
When handing my bonnet and shawl, 
But was it the way to reward me, 
To make me bridesmaid after all ? 
Heigh-ho ! heigh ho 
Pm only bridesmaid after all. 
He has written me songs by the dozen, 
And drawn in my scrapbook a 
church, 
But little I 
dream'd that my cousin 
He'd wed and leave me in the lurch, 
And she's so exceedingly dumpy, 
While he's so remarkably tall, 
Ah! one time how little I 
thought, 
To be but a 
bridesmaid after all. 
We had laughed at her vile affectation, 
And called her a " star" and a" blue," 
We had sneer'd at her clumsy flirtation, 
When playing together at loo. 
In order to show myself off, 
I 
took her to rout and to ball, 
And now she'll sneer, mock, and scoff, 
As I'm but bridesmaid after all. 
But I'll stifle my tears if I 
die, 
They shall none of them know what I 
feel, 
To be cold as a 
statue I'll try, 
And my heart shall be harder than steel ; 
I 
still have one orderly beau. 
If to- day on his knees he should fall, 
And propose I 
would never say, " No !" 
So I 
may be a 
bride after all.

Charming Widow Brown. 
Oh dear, I've been cast down of late, 
The reason to you I 
will state, 
You'll pity me when I 
relate, 
About charming Widow Brown. 
She had two pretty little feet, 
Black bonnet, shawl, and fall complete, 
In fact she was a 
perfect treat, 
That charming Widow Brown, 
She'd a 
handsome house, 'twas all her own, 
The front with ivy overgrown, 
And in it she lived all alone, 
The charming widow Brown. 
I 
watched her issue from her gate, 
My heart it beat with joy elate, 
With her I 
would have linked my fate. 
That charming Widow Brown. 
I 
said to her, " Excuse me pray, 
I 
saw you out the other day, 
And since you've led me quite astray. 
You charming Widow Brown." 
I 
the question popped, she did consent, 
Next morning to the church we went, 
And so I 
married her quite content, 
That charming Widow Brown. 
But our wedding morn did not bring joy, 
For sorrow black did it alloy, 
I 
heard a 
voice say " I 
want you, my boy, 
For wedding Mrs. Brown. 
I 
was taken on her wedding day, 
And put in quod her debts to pay, 
And with some other chap she cut away, 
And I 
was quite done brown.

had Mrs. Brown's.

The Rose by the Fountain. 
The wild flowers awoke in the woodlands, 
The lark soar'd aloft in the sky; 
The lilies looked up from the bosom 
Of the stream that went murmuring by. 
King Oswald came down from the mountain, 
With banner of crimson unfurled; 
To pluck the first rose from the fountain, 
With dew-drops so softly itnpearled. 
The wild flowers, &c. 
He bore it away from the forest, 
To give to his beautiful Queen; 
Away to the home of his father, 
The old castle built on the green. 
A 
soft smile play'd round her sweet features. 
The rich blushing flow'ret to see; 
And together they formed this compact, 
The wild-rose their emblem should be., 
The wild flowers, tte,

graphic power any similar works ever published.

Now Ready: 
No. I. THE DEMON OF THE DESERT. 
This book is one of the most powerfully exciting novels ever written. 
The 
scenes are laid in Southern Texas—the land of the rifle, the tomahawk and the 
scalping knife. 
Strange and terrible adventures crimson almost every page. 
Wondrous contrasts keep the reader's attention engaged. 
The beautiful Prai-
rie Girl and the devilish half-breed—the generous young Hunter and the 
awful Fear of the Forest cross each other's paths. 
The fawn and the ja-
guar--the dove and the vulture—are types of the unceasing struggle of in-
nocence and vice—perpetually occurring on every leaf of this startling book. 
No. 2. PRAIRIE PETE; or, tlio Trappors Avenger. 
- I 
Of all the tales of wild adventure in forest and prairie, this is the most ex-
cellent. 
The reader seems to actually hear the yell of the demon red skins, 
sees their painted Loss, and witness the luri't flames of the frontier log 
cabin. 
Hears, too, the sharp rifle crack of the hunter and the trapper as 
they send the unerring bullet of the avenger into the cruel hearts of the for-
est desperado. The vast expanse of the flower carpeted prairie—the gloomy 
vista of the dense forest—the silver lak:-.-the high peaked mountains, and 
the dark caverns, haunts of the wild cat and the grizly - bear, are all produ-
ced with vividness and wonderful power, in this captivating story.
