Howard Marshall: Do you have any oeliefs about when the 
best time to t these wooden posts 
in the ground according to the moon and 
all that? 
Vera M.: Oh, iny Dad did, out I don't remember what it was. 
He even killed his hogs and cows... 
H.M.: (overlap) By the signs? 
V.M.:Uh huh. And planted his garden, everything by the 
signs 
H.M.: What was the sign for those things? 
V.M.: Well, when tne sign was in the twins, he planted 
his garden stuff, you know, and never when it was 
the flower girl, you know, I don't know what they're 
called, urn. scientifically but r.urn. . . and I think the 
dark of the moon was when he killed his animals and 
the meat wouldn't shrink so much. 
H.M.: Do you follow those signs at all yourself? 
V.M.: Wo 
H.M.: Does I.W.? j_her husband^ 
V.M.: We don't 
H.M.: Why? 
V.M.:Well, mostly because I guess when we get ready to, 
uh(kill a pig, we just kill it and have it processed 
and, you know, but my Dad did the whole thing. He 
killed it and...from the beginning to the end. 
H.M.: So maybe it's not as important to keep track of things 
like that as it used to be? 
V.M.: It probably is,uhfbut I think we're more wasteful 
now you know 
H.M.: (overlap) That's always... 
V.M.: (overlap) I know, I know that the signs for the 
garden work, because one time he didn't notice the 
sign and he planted a row of peas and this, uh elderly 
man* came by and he told him, "These peas won't produce. 
My Dad laughed at him and then he says, "Do what..." 
and then he says, "I'll tell you when to...plant 
another row." He came by, you know, later. My Dad 
did plant another row. Well the, the vines 
didn't get very big, but they got peeeaass all over 
them. But Dad's vines got, oh/ like 3 or 4 foot tall, 
(laughter from H.M. and B.O.), bloomed, (murmurs 
from H.M. and B.O.) but no vegetables 
Ii.M. and B.O.: Ohhhh... 
V.M.: So... it's true. I mean, it does happen, it does 
make a difference. But I think nowadays we just... 
H.M.: You don't uh bother 
V.M.: We just...sort of 
H.M.: (overlap) ...Bother about it as much 
V.M.: Huh uh. I don't think anybody does anymore.
