Ben RiceLake Ponsey TrainAlternative title: The Creole Girl.Oh, ? [gaiters?] I lead my weary wayO'er
railroad ties and crossings my weary feet did strayAnd at the close of evening some higher ground
to gainAnd there I met with the Creole girl on lake [onthe?] Ponsey Train."Good evening, my pretty
fair miss, my money does me no good,;If it wasn't for the alligators, I'd sleep out in the wood.""You're
welcome, welcome, stranger, although our house is plain,We never turn a stranger out on the lake
in the Ponsey Train."She took me to her mother's hours, she treated me quite well.Her hair hung
down in ringlets, down o'er shoulders fair,I tried to paint her beauty, but I found it all in vain.How
handsome was this Creole gilr girl on the lake in the Ponsey Train[!?]I asked ['er?] if she'd marry me;
she said that never could be;She said she had a lover and he was far on sea;She said she had a lover
and true she would remain'Till he came back to claim his bride on lake to the Ponsey Train."Good
evening, my pretty fair miss, if I never see you any more,I shall never forget your kindness in the
cottage by the shore,And when I go for to leave this place, some fourteen cups I'll drink,I'll drink to
the heart of the Creole girl on lake to the Ponsey Train."
