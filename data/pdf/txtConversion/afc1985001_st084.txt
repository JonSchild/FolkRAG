Ol' Blue
OLE BLUE
King Family Arvin, 1940
I had a little dog, and his name was “Blue” I'll tell to you what he would do He'd leave
home every night about dark Wouldn't be gone long till you'd hear him bark Ole Blue, you
rascal you, Ole Blue
One time he ran, when he got free He got a big possum up a white oak tree Oh Blue, you
rascal you, Ole Blue Gonna climb up there and get him down I'll have him cooked good
and brown Sweet potatoes laid all around and around Ole Blue, you rascal you, Ole Blue
One day Ole Blue, he tak'n got sick We sent for the doctor, and we sent for him quick For
Blue, you rascal you, Ole Blue Ole Blue he died and he died so hard He scratched little
holes all over the yard Ole Blue, you rascal you, Ole Blue.
We dug his grave in a shady place And covered his grave with a possum face Ole Blue,
you rascal you, Ole Blue We dug his grave with a silver spade And let him down with a
golden chain Every link of that chain slipped through my hand I'll call his name Ole Blue,
you rascal you, Ole Blue
When I come lay my banjo down And go to heaven and wear a crown You Blue, you
rascal you, Ole Blue When I get there I know what I'll do I'll get my horn and I'll call for Blue
“Heah Blue! Yeach, Blue, you rascal you, Ole Blue.”
