The Charming Young Widow 
I 
MET IN THE TRAIN. 
Whilst in New-Jersey, a 
letter was sent to me 
From Boston, which bid me quickly repair 
To an uncle ; it stated : fast he was dying, 
The wis:i had expressed to make me his heir. 
So, hurriedly- packing a 
few things together, 
Wishing that Boston quickly might gain, 
By a 
first-class express went ; in the same carriage, 
A 
charming young widow I 
met in the train. 
An infant she had, so fondly caressing; 
I 
ventured to ask : If that was her own ? 
Sic answered, in words appearing distressing: 
Yes; and its Papa is dead and gone! 
When the question I 
asked, in my face looking. 
Timt lo.)k 1 
shall ne'er be forgetting again ! 
In fact, fast my heart to herself was hooking, 
Was t1ie. charming young widow I 
met in the train. 
As the train it was stopping, the engine to water, 
She asked, in a 
hurry: Would I 
be so kind 
Her infant to take it, the darling so quiet ? 
Of course, I 
replied, I 
didn't mind. 
To the refreshment- room she went into. 
Tim signal for starting I 
heard but in vain, 
Not a 
glimpse could I 
see of her : the train with-
out started 
The charming young widow I 
met in the train. 
Loud I 
was shouting, the train to be stopping, 
Oat of the window putting my head ; 
No answer receiving, the infant I 
took it, 
Discovered, 0 
horror! it was dead ! 
On its bosom was sewn a 
note: which on reading 
Found I 
was taken in, done for, quite plain: 
It begged me to bury the child for the sake of 
The charming young widow I 
met in the train.

Quite dead asleep, so, in truth, I 
found.

could not explain; 
On a stone was inscribed: Underneath was be-

And she dressed so neat; 
Of all the pretty yaller gals was ever in the town,

Oh! the first time that I 
saw her, she was dressed 
up to the teeth, 
The look that she then gave me nearly took away 
my breath. 
I 
asked her if she would only be true to me, 
And, when I'd sell my Poodle-Dog, a

How a

And promised for to marry me upon the first of 
May,

'Twas on the first of April when I

Until I 
lost myself entirely, I 
cannot tell you

As long as I

For she promised then to marry me upon the first

way ?)

Oh, yes, Sir t" she speedily replied, 
Take the turning on the left, then go down the

ever yet did hear,

Don't be too distant or too kind, 
Be not to your own feelings blind,

If men flatter, vow and swear, 
Affect the pangs of deep despair, 
Girls of such a

Never Mind the Rest. 
Trustfully and thankfully, 
Oh I 
tread the path of life. 
It may not be all flowers, 
Nor free from care and strife; 
But it is by blows, that iron grows, 
Of greater strength possess'd 
Then bear life's buffets manfully, 
" 
And never mind the rest." 
Each thing has its work to do, 
Its mission to fulfil ; 
The wind that blows, the plant that grows, 
The waters' never still. 
Then need we ask, " have we a 
task—" 
'Tis graven in each breast, 
Go do life's duties manfully, 
".And never mind the rest." 
Gentle words and kindly deeds, 
Are never thrown away, 
But bring unlook'd for harvest 
On some cloudy autumn day. 
We are but steward § of our wealth, 
Of all by us possess.d; 
Go, do life's duties manfully, 
And never mind the rest. 
Oh, How the Gals Deceive Us • 
Mr. Jones kept a 
pork and a 
sassenger shop, 
Situate in the suburbs of town, 
He was sometimes addicted to taking a 
drop, 
The smell of the bacon to drown. 
He had but one shopman, and that was poor me, 
One servant-of-all-work as well, 
So the house for its occupants only had three, 
For what reason I 
never could tell.

Bacon and cheese, that's if you please, 
I'm the young shopman who serves you with ease,

You all the cheese, yet you never can tell. 
Master nightly went out for his pipe and his glass, 
Leaving Ellen and I 
there alone, 
And its not at all strange being left with the lass, 
That some favor to me she had shown. 
After closing the shop I 
would go down and sup, 
And many's the tit- bit with Nell, 
I 
have had till between us affection sprung up, 
Very strange, but you never can tell. 
Chorus. 
One night I 
went out but returned before time.] 
And down stairs as usual did walk, 
When arrived at the door a 
surprise great was 
mine, 
Two voices inside were at talk. 
I 
looked through the key hole and what did I 
see, 
A 
sight which bound me like a 
spell, 
My worthy employer had Nell on his knee, 
Which proves that you never can tell. 
Chorus. 
Then I 
went up to bed, but at supper next night, 
I 
questioned her as to the act, 
She said, " Dearest Goorgy, I 
own it's not right, 
But I 
did it for you, love, in fact. 
I 
love you most dearly, which if master knew, 
He'd discharge me, you know very well, 
So I 
just let him kiss inc to stay here with you. 
Perhaps she did, but you never can tell.

thought I

But I 
didn't, you never can tell. 
In less than a 
year Death a 
tight hold did fix, 
On the poor and unfortunate Jones, 
And a

Accepted the pork butcher's bones. 
At his loss there were two who appeared very sad, 
That was I 
and his little wife Nell, 
But to tell you the truth I 
think we were gad, 
But of course, friends, you never can tell. 
Chorus. 
In less than six months our old love returned, 
And I 
think had more ardently grown, 
The flame of affection more vigorously burned, 
So I 
soon changed Nerrs name to my own,

And who knows before long he may, perhaps, fill

It said, " Young single men 
Taken in and done for." 
I

So pulled at the bell handle, 
When the door did open fly, 
And there stood Mrs. Randall; 
As a 
week's deposit, I 
Did pay her more than dollar one for, 
And next day I 
went, oh, my! 
To be taken in and done for." 
They nice folks seemed to be, 
And the daughter, Juliana, 
Said " If I 
liked, that she 
Would teach me the piano ;" 
Like spiders round me they 
A 
regular web had spun for, 
And from that very day, 
I 
was taken in and done for. 
I 
was beset every day 
So said to them, one morning 
"Bring my week's bill, I'll pay, 
For I 
mean to give you warning," 
They quick brought it to me, 
Which almost did me stun, for,

The Mauve Kid Glove. 
In the Central Park the other day, 
Last week, I 
chanced to hie there, 
And while a-strolling up and down, 
A 
damsel sweet did spy there; 
Her hair was of an auburn bright, 
Her face a 
thick fall hid it, 
But the loadstone of attraction—there, 
'Twas a 
mauve kid glove that did it. 
CHORUS. 
Although her face I 
did not see, 
For the thick, black fall that hid it, 
The guidin ,r 
star that led me on,— 
'Twas a 
mauve kid glove that did it. 
Thinks I. that fall, if I 
knew all, 
Soms lovely face conceals there, 
More, when the dove took off her glove, 
And a 
nice small hand reveal'd there ; 
I 
thought I'd then make bold to speak 
So thus s 
did address her.

Great Stories of the Highway. 
JONATHAN WILD SERIES. 
Jonathan Wild was at once the Fogui and the _
Pouch(' of criminals. 
He made men bad, apparently to have the pleasure of convicting 
them. Were the acts of this villain's life not proven true, they would 
appear incredible. 
Round him clustered all the notorious and daring 
law-breakers of the time. 
Paul Clifford and his associates were the 
sattilites that revolved around his baleful Star. 
It is only in the 
pages of these books that a 
true account of his most extraordinary 
career, and those of his associates can be found.

as full of life and adieu as the tempest-
tossed billows upon which the smug-
gler's daughter was cradled,
