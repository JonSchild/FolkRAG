The Rising of the Moon. 
[This song which is the production of John B. 
Casey 
the Galtee Boy," now an inmate of an 
English dungeon. is 
immensely popular here, 
especially in the West, where it is often made the 
Marching Tune of men eager to emulate the patri-
otic example of the Men of 'OS. 
It is sung to the 
air of: Wearing of the Green; the Chorus being 
given by the repetition of the two last lines as in 
' 
Benny Havens."] 
Oh! then, tell me, Shane O'Farrell, tell me where 
you hurry so? 
Hush, ma bouelial! hush and listen—and his cheeks 
were all aglow, 
I 
bear orders from the captain: get you ready quick 
and soon; 
For, the pikes must be together by the risin' of the 
Moon. 
CHORUS. 
By the rising of the Moon, by the rising of the 
Moon; 
Fox the pikes must be together by the rising of the 
Moon. 
Oh ! then, tell me, Shane O'Farrell, where the 
gatherin' is to be ? 
In the ould spot, by the river, right well-known to 
you and me. 
One word more: for signal-token, whistle up the 
marchin' tune, 
With ycur pike upon your shoulder by the risin' 
of the Moon. 
By the rising of the Moon, &c. 
Out from many a

Many a 
man y 
heart was throbbing for that blessed 
xvarning-light ; 
Murmurs passed along the valley, like the ban-
s 
ice's lonely croon ; 
And a 
thousand pikes were flashing by the rising 
of the Moon. 
By the rising of the Moon, &c. 
DAwn along yon singing river, that dark mass of 
men was seen ; 
High al»ye their shining weapons floats their own 
hsloved green. 
Death to every foe and traitor ! forward ! strike the 
ma rchin' tune !' 
And hurrah, my boys, for Freedom! ' tis the rising 
of the Moon. 
'Tie the rising of the Moon, Sze. ; 
Well they fought for poor Ould Ireland, and full 
bitter was their fate ; 
Oh !

manhood's burning-noon,

Petticoat Lane. 
When to Dublin I 
came from the sweet County 
Down, 
I 
called on a 
friend to show me the town ; 
He brought me thro' streets, lanes and alleys so 
grand, 
'Till my brogues were most wore, and I 
scarcely 
could stand. 
He show'd me fine houses, were built up so high, 
Marion and his Men, Or, the Tory Prisoner.

And a 
man made of stone almost up to the sky; 
But the names of them places went out of my 
brain, 
Except one, and he said it .
;,vas : Petticoat Lane 
Convenient to Petticoat Lane, there was a 
place, 
And as we walked through it we couldn't get 
peace; 
The shops were all full of fine clothing, black and 
blue 
But the fellows outside nearly tore me in two: 
One dragged me this way, to get a 
good frieze, 
Another had corduroy breeches, my size : 
But one chap bawls out, when I 
would remain 
Show him up to the college in Petticoat Lane! 
We got loose from the spot, myself and my friend, 
I 
couldn't do less than a 
teaser to spend: 
But we spied boys and girls in a 
laughable group, 
Sitting cross-legged, and they licking up soup. 
Says I: are these what you call your poor- house 
recruits ? 
Ax the divil, says one, and his bowl at me shoots. 
They roared with pleasure, while I 
roared with 
pain : 
Arra'', Paddy, you're welcome to Petticoat Lane! 
My friend thought to drag me away by the 
sleeve, 
When a 
tartar dropt over my head an old sieve; 
I 
turned for to strike her, and got in the eye 
A 
plaster of what they called : hot-mutton pie ! 
I 
kept groping about like a 
man that was blind, 
Till I 
caught hould of somebody comity , behind: 
I 
prayed that I 
might get the strength of a 
CAIN, 
To be ABLE to whale him in Petticoat Lane. 
I 
walloped away, and I 
got walloped, too, 
While all sort of ructions were raised by the crew ; 
You would swear it was raining brick-bats and 
stones, 
Masanielle. Or, the Fisherman's League. 
Details the uprising of the furious lazzaroni with wonderful vigor.

Till I 
heard my antagonist giving some groans. 
Run and be d 
d 
to you ! some one did cry. 
Sure, I 
can't for the mutton that's stuck in my eye! 
I 
was led through the crowd, and heard somebody 
saying': 
There's a 
peeler most kill'd, up in Petticoat Lane! 
These words, like a 
thunderbolt, fell on my ear: 
So, I 
scooped all the fat from my eye, pretty clear. 
My friend tould the crowd that was round : to be 
mute ! 
While we slipped to a 
house called: the sign of the 
boot: 
There I 
call'd for a 
sup/and we both took a 
seat: 
Two or three that had backed us, came in for a 
treat— 
When the reckoning was called for, my pockets 
were clean; 
For, pounds, shillings and pence were in Petticoat 
Lane. 
The reck'ning it came to a 
hog and a 
groat, 
For which the landlord he took the lend of my 
coat; 
I 
started without, still cursing the town, 
When a 
policeman's pot-stick made friends with 
my crown. 
Says he: You have killed C. 106 ;— 
Arrah, be aisy, sir! I 
want none of your tricks. 
But the sergeant and twenty more swore it was 
plain 
That I 
was the bully of Petticoat Lane. 
They all swarmed about me, like flies on a 
cask; 
But to prison to take me was no easy task, 
When I 
got there, I 
was charged with the crime ; 
'Twas my own brother Darby I 
bate all the time. 
Whin he seen me, he let a 
thundering curse 
On the day that he first went to join in the force; 
He released my ould coat and he got me off clean, 
To go home and say prayers for sweet Petticoat 
Lane.

Her Bright Smile Haunts Me Still. 
'Tis years since last we met, 
And we may not meet again; 
rI 
have struggled to forget, 
But that struggle was in vain. 
For, her voice lives on the breeze, 
And her spirit comes at will ; 
In the midnight on the seas, 
Her bright smile haunts me still. 
For, her voice, Szc 
At the first sweet dawn of light, 
When I 
gaze upon'the deep, 
Her form still greets my sight. 
While the stars their vigils keep 
When I 
close mine aching eyes, 
Sweet dreams my senses fill; 
And, from sleep when I 
arise, 
IIer bright smile haunts me still, 
When I 
close, &c.

Yet her presence is not flown, 
Her bright smile haunts me still.

have thee repeat it again ; 
And Ion , on my mind the gaze of thine eye 
Still lingers and lives, when thou art not nigh, 
Lingers and lives, when thou art not nigh. 
I

The look of thine eye, nor the words of thy tongue,

So, keep me forever thus dreaming of thee; 
Then turn not away ;: thy heart I

While viewing the gems of our dear native land. 
But lot him, dear Oona, behold thy dear face, 
He'll be blind to all other sweet charms of the 
place. 
Oh! the lake's not so deep as the wound in my 
breast, 
Nor the mountain so high as the hope of my 
heart, 
That only with Oona in life can be blest, 
And only in death with her image will part. 
For rove where I 
will, when I 
think of that face, 
Och, I'm blind to all other sweet charms of the 
place.

Nora O'Neal. 
Oh! I'm lonely to-night, love, without you. 
And I 
sigh for one glance of your eye; 
For, sure there's a 
charm, love, about you, 
Whenever I 
know you are nigh. 
Like the beam of the star when ' tis 
Is the glance which your eye can't conceal, 
And your voice is so sweet and beguiling 
That I 
love you, sweet Nora O'Neal. 
CHORUS. 
Oh! don't think that ever I'll doubt you, 
My love I 
will never conceal, 
Oh 1 
I'm lonely to-
night, love, without you, 
My darling sweet Nora O'Neal 
Oh! the nightingale sings in the wild-wood, 
As if every note that he knew 
Was learned from your sweet voice in childhood, 
To remind me, sweet Nora of you, 
The Pledge, Or, the First Step to Fortune. 
Never was a 
noble lesson taught in a 
more interesting style.

The Blarney. 
Oh! when a 
young bachelor woes a 
young maid, 
Who's eager to go, and yet willing to stay, 
She sighs and she blushes, and looks haa-afraid, 
Bat loses no word that her lover can say : 
What is it she hears but the blarney—the blar-
ney? 
! 
a 
perilous thing is the blarney! 
To all that he tells her she gives no reply, 
Or murmurs and whispers so gentle and low; 
And though he has ask'd her when nobody's by, 
She dare not say " Yes," and she cannot say 
She knows what she hears is the blarney—the 
blarney— 
Oh! a 
perilous thing is the blarney! 
But people get used to a 
perilous thing, 
And fancy the sweet words of lovers are true ; 
So let all their blarney be pass'd through a 
ring, 
The charm will prevent all the ill it can do. 
Then maids have no fear of the blarney—the blar-
ney— 
Or the peril that lies in the blarney

I 
The Lucky Stars. 
How often Tv'e heard my dear granny 
Relate how we poor mortals are 
Some born to good luck, some more often 
Beneath an unfortunate star; 
I 
ne'er could tell one from the other, 
Though often she said I 
should see 
If Mars came in contact with Venus 
The stars would prove lucky to me. 
At that I 
was puzzled completely, 
I 
tried, but I 
never could see, 
As I 
of the stars could know nothing, 
How could they find out about me. 
One sweet summer eve, when so brightly 
The stars all above tile did shine, 
I 
was walking alone, and I 
wondered 
Which bright shining orb could be mine ; 
Just then who should steal down the meadows 
But Dennis returned from the wars; 
Said 
Who could dream of this meeting ?" 
Said he, " 'Twas foretold by the stars. 
" 
You know I 
oft called you my Venus, 
And now I'm a 
true son of Man ; 
And remember, dear girl, that your granny 
Said you always should trust to your stars." 
I 
told him of what I'd been thinking, 
" 
All the better for both, then," said he, 
" 
There is Mars smiling kindly at Venus, 
So you should smile kindly on me." 
No more is my soldier a 
rover, 
I 
am proud of his fame and his scars, 
And was I 
to blame to get married. 
Since ' twas all along ruled by the stars? 
Thn't laugh at me, single young ladies, 
For when the time comes it must be ; 
You must trust te your stars and may bless.

If as lucky as mine were to me.

One Paddy O'Lynn courted Widdy Maay, 
He bold as a

Now No win her, he knew he the widdy must 
plaise, 
So he thought the best thing he could do was to 
taze. 
" 
Now Paddy be aisy, you devil," she'd cry, 
And she'd smack Paddy's chops, while she'd look 
at him sly ; 
"Lave your tricks and your nonsense, and mind 
your affai rs, 
Through your tickling, I 
know, I'll be tumbling 
up stairs!" 
" 
My honey," says Paddy, " that, some folks do 
say 
Is a 
sign that you'll soon know your own wedding 
day; 
And it's plelsed that I 
am—sure to say so's no sin, 
Since Vs all for good luck," says Paddy O'Lynn. 
" 
Arrah, now !" says she, " Pat, don't think of the 
like, 
For I 
didn't say no to your fat cousin Mike, 
The sole of my shoe he loves, though it arn't 
whole; 
Says Paddy, " I'd rather love you than your soul." 
" 
Now Paddy, I'll squeal, and I'll punch your fool's 
head— 
Sure I'm dreaming each night I've your cousin in 
bed ;" 
Says Paddy, " that same I 
am glad that you say, 
For drames always go quite the contrary way; 
So widdy, kape draming that same till you die, 
When you drame Mike's in bed, why, you'll find

And sure then 'tis time that you left off such stuff, 
For your sake I've been fighting and breaking my 
head, 
And I 
think, after this, it is time we were wed." 
Then Paddy, so sly, threw his arm round her 
waist, 
And his lips put to hers of their sweetness to taste; 
And he looked in her eyes, that were sparkling so 
bright, 
And he hugged her swate form—faith, then, sure 
he did right. 
"Now, Paddy, be quiet, to take you I'm loath, 
Sure I've now had two husbands, and done for 
them both;

Then have me for the third, and p'rhaps this time

In Union Square there liv'd a 
maid. 
Her name was Susan it was said, 
And parlor maid she long had been, 
To a 
rich old gent called Colonel Green. 
The coachman tried her heart to win, 
But his fellow servants with a

Cried, " Alt, there's no chance for you, Dan, 
For Susan loves her soap fat man.

With his curly hair and handsome nose, 
He really was the pink of beaux; 
Find such another few girls can, 
As handsome Dick the soap fat man. 
Dick called one day to see his Sue, 
And what befell I'll tell to you, 
The master came home unawares, 
Poor Susan bolted down the stairs. 
Crying, " Cookee, I'm in such a 
fright, 
Here's master's come home nearly tight, 
Do, cookee, pray devise some plan, 
To save my handsome soap fat man."

Now cook was tall and fat you see, 
And dearly lov'd a

Site dress'd Dick up in woman's clothes, 
And he look'd a

But Dan the coachman found it out, 
And out of pure revenge, no doubt.

The master to the kitchen hied, 
And Dick in female dress espied, 
lie vow'd he lionor'd female charms, 
Then round poor Dick he threw his arms; 
Dick didn't like the kissing part, 
So for the stairs be made a 
start, 
He gain'd the streets, where a 
race began, 
After handsome Dick the soap fat man. 
With his curly hair, &c 
Dick ran as if for life or death, 
But he was caught when out of breath, 
By brave policeman ninety-eight, 
And went before a 
magistrate; 
As Dick had done no harm, why he 
Was quickly set at liberty; 
And Susan, as the story ran, 
Was married to her soap fat man.

The Loving Postman; 
OR HIS HEART WENT PIT-A-PAT. 
I 
tell of a 
lass, nam'd Mary Day, 
A 
servant up in Broadway, 
Who lov'd a 
postman, I've heard say, 
Who brought the letters to the door. 
How speedily upstairs she strove, 
When she saw him coining down the road, 
Her countenance such joy it show'd 
When she answer'd him at the door. 
CHORUS 
His heart always went pit-a-pat, 
And hers, too, at his loud rat-tat, 
his heart went always pit-a-pat, 
Whenever he knock'd at the door. 
Job Jenkins was the postman's name, 
With Mary he in love became, 
To win her was his little game, 
Each day he loved her more.

Tho' he call'd forty times a 
day, 
He could'ut muster pluck to say 
" 
I 
love you dearly, Mary Day," 
He only press'd her hand at the door. 
Now, Job was anything but a 
fool, 
And said when he thought of it cool, 
" 
Why I 
should not write there's no rule 
At once to Mary Day, 
And say I 
pining am away." 
So he did, and posted the note straightway, 
And delivered it himself that day, 
With other letters to Miss Day. 
And when that letter Mary read, 
If she stood on her heels .or head, 
She hardly knew but upstairs sped, 
And read it times a 
score. 
She almost fainted right away, 
For the postman he went on to say, 
He hoped she'd speak the following day, 
When he came with letters to the door. 
The very next day when he called there, 
He saw he h • d 
no cause to despair, 
And said," I 
love you true, my fair, 
And shall always you adore." 
Then answer'd blushing Mary Day, 
" 
Ive only got this much to say, 
I 
love you, and will name the day 
Next time you come to our door." 
And so they settled it then and there, 
They constancy to each did swear, 
She smooth'd her crinoline and back hair, 
Witen he went from the door. 
And they were wedded I've heard so, 
Tito' that may be some years ago, 
Still he causes her no grief or woe, 
They both each other do adore.

Sweet Lila Brown. 
My LiIla was a 
charming girl, 
She was raised away down South, 
And the prettiest features in her face 
'Were the lips around her mouth. 
Stop the dance, stop the song, 
Lay the banjo down, 
For she is now in the happy land, 
Sweet Lilla Brown. 
Her voice was all melodies, 
Like the sound of a 
silver flp; 
And when she walked around the room, 
She sailed just like a 
ship, 
Her feet they were so very long, 
That when she turned around 
She fell into the Southern Bay, 
And there she ran aground. 
That was her end and no mistake, 
Oh! how this darkie cried ; 
He smothered his solemncholyness 
With oysters raw and fried. 
But now—oh, my! she's dead and gone, 
Way down in Southern Bay; 
The oysters sing her lullaby 
To my sweet darkie fay.

What Irish Boys Can Do. 
ANSWER TO 
"NO IRISH NEED APPLY." 
They insult an Irishman and think nought of what 
they say, 
They'll call him green, an Irish bull, it happens 
every day ; 
Now to these folks 
say a 
word—to sing a 
song 
try— 
And answer to those dirty word; " No Irish need 
apply." 
So, if you give attention, I'll sing my sour,- to you, 
And the subject of my song shall be, " What Irish 
boys can do." 
If you'd come to Ireland they'd treat you well, I'm 
sure ; 
Pat would share his last potato with the destitute 
and poor ; 
If you were sick and weary, and had no place to 
rest, 
The bed you'd get, though poor perhaps, would be 
Pat's very best, 
He'd nurse you, too, he would that, and give you 
whiskey, too, 
And you cannot find a ' nobler act than Irishmen 
can do. 
Did you ever know an Irishman from any danger 
flinch ? 
In fighting, too, he'd rather die than give his foe 
an inch. 
Among the bravest in the world are the zons of 
Erin's green Isle. 
Sure the Iron Duke of Wellington was a 
native of 
the soil. 
And didn't he badly whip the French on the plains 
of Waterloo, 
_Which plainly showed to the whole world what 
Irishmen can do.

Old Ireland s 
lied her warriors, who fought both 
true and brave; 
Pat's assisted every nation, on the land and on the 
wave• 
And poets, too, she's had—yes, many and many a 
a 
score, 
Where can you find much brighter stars than 
Lover or Tom Moore? 
Old Ireland's had her actors, and authors not a 
few 
And things of wit and humor the Irish all can do. 
Did you ne'er hear tell of Sheridan, or of lament-
ed Catharine Hays? 
Did you ne'er see fun in Irish songs, or laugh at 
Irish plays ? 
Old Ireland's had her statesmen—their fame the 
wide world rings! 
She's likewise had musicians, to tune her old harps 
strings ! 
Not all Irish girls are beautiful, but then they're 
al ways true, 
And for faith and generosity the Irish girls will do. 
And then, too, in the present war between the 
North and South, 
Let no dirty slur on Irish ever escape your mouth. 
Sure did you ne'er hear tell of the 69th, who 
bravely fought at Bull Run, 
And Maher, of the seven days' fight, that was in 
front of Richmond ? 
With General Shields, who fought so brave for the 
flag red, white and blue. 
And anything like a 
bayonet charge the Irish boys 
can do. 
Then why slur upon the Irish ? why are they treat-
ed so ? 
What is it you have against them is what I 
want 
to know ?

That Rogue Reilly. 
There's a 
boy that follows me every day 
Although he declares that I 
use him vilely, 
But all I 
can do, he won't go away, 
This obstinate ranting Reilly. 
In every street 'tis him I 
meet, 
In vain the byway path I 
try, 
The very shadow of my feet 
I 
might as well attempt to fly, 
As that boy that follows me every day, 
Although he declares that I 
use him vilely, 
Yet all I 
can say, he won't go away, 
That raking ranting Reilly. 
My mother she sent me ten miles away, 
In hopes that the fellow would never find me. 
But the very next day we were making hay, 
The villain stood close behind me, 
" 
For this," says I " you shall dearly pay, 
How dare you such a 
freedom take ?" 
Says he, " I 
heard you were making hay 
And I 
thought, my dear, you'd want a 
rake, 
And therefore I 
followed you here to-day 
With your diamond eye and your point 
Like a 
needle concealed in a 
bundle of hay, 
But I 
found you out," said Reilly. 
ltold him at last in a 
rage to pack, 
And then for a 
while he fought more shyly, 
But like a 
bad shilling, he soon came back, 
That counterfeit rogue, that Reilly, 
To hunt me up he takes disguise— 
One day a 
beggar wench appiars, 
'Twas the rogue himself, but I 
knew his eyes, 
And didn't I 
box the rascal's ears, 
Yet still he keeps following every day, 
Plotting and planning so 'cute and slyly, 
There isn't a 
fox more tricks can play 
Than raking ranting Reilly.

The Whistling Thief. 
When Pat came o'er the hills his colleen fair to 
see, 
His whistle, loud and shrill, his signal was to be. 
" 
Oh Mary," the mother cried, " There's some one 
whistling, sure." 
"Oh, Mother, you know it's the wind that's whis-
tling, through the door. 
(Whistling " Garry Owen.") 
" 
I've liv'd a 
long time, Mary, in this wide world, 
my dear, 
But the wind to whistle like that I 
never did hear," 
"But, mother, you know the fiddle hangs close be-
hind the &link, 
And the wind upon the strings is playing a 
tune I 
kink." 
(Dog barks). 
" 
The dog is barking, now, and the fiddle can't 
play that tune," 
" 
But mother, you know that dogs will bark when 
they see the moon," 
" 
Now how can he see the moon, when you know 
he's old and blind, 
Blind dogs can't see the moon, nor fiddles be played 
by the wind." 
(Pig grunts.) 
" 
And now the pig is uneasy in his mind," 
" 
But mother, you know they say that pigs can 
see the wind," 
" 
That's all very well in the day, but than I 
may 
remark, 
That pigs no more than we see anything in the 
dark.

The Piper, Or Terry O'Roon. 
Och! there ne'et was a 
piper like Terry O'Roon, 
Sure he bother'd them all with his wonderful tune; 
And the like of that same, when it came in his head, 
It never was aqualed by living or dead. 
And this is the reason—a 
long time ago, 
As Terry's own family histories show, 
A 
fairey once brought to his grandfather's cot 
The very same pipes that now Terry has got; 
" 
And sure," said his father, who took up the trade, 
" 
St. Patrick himself on the same may have play'd ;" 
But none of the pipe-playing house of O'Roon, 
Like Terry could strike up the wonderful tune, 
Och bothering, wheedling Terry O'Roon, 
He charru'd every heart with his wonderful thne. 
'Tis said when he struck up his pipes by the shore 
That the fishes danced jigs, and the sea ceased to 
roar, 
That the rocks split with laughing, that herring and 
sprats 
Should foot it with shell-fish, and round fish and 
flats. 
Be that as it may, Terry swears that its trut, 
But he might have been dreaming Letwixt me and 
you; 
On a 
taste of the creature— that caused him to think, 
(For pipers have ever been jewels to drink) 
And Terry himself, when the whiskey was strong, 
He ne'er play'd so well, nor so loud, nor so long, 
Till he set them all dancing—sly Terry O'Roon, 
And whatever.he play'd 'twas a 
wonderfnl tune, 
Och bothering, wheedling, &c. &c. 
There was never a 
wake, nor a 
fight, nor a 
fair, 
But Terry O'Roon he was sure to be there 
And many's the match that was made I'll be bound 
When his wonderful pipes drew the lasses around;

But Terry himself was a 
rogue, and its true 
it was all one to him whether black eyes or blue, 
For when his flirtations some beauty would vex, 
" 
Arrah, Honey !" he says, " aint I 
true to the sex." 
And so be went on with his wheedling ways 
And his pipe-playing tricks to the end of his days; 
But there ne'er was a 
piper like Terry O'Roon, 
That was gifted, like him, with a 
wonderful tune !

Sure he won ev'ry heart with his; wonderful

Ant" 
The Cavalier." 
A 
lover one day—'twas in Venice they say— 
(In beautiful Venice I 
mean) 
Half suspected his love to be less of a 
dove 
Than for his sake she ought to have been; 
So be thought he would go one fine night for a 
row, 
And he forth to her dwelling did steer, 
Oe'r the waters so far, with his Spanish guitar 
Disguised as a 
gay Gondolier. 
When he got to the spot his fair lady knew not 
Her beau in his boatman's disgujse; 
But she hired the boat, and they soon were afloat. 
Gliding on ' neath the bluest of skies. 
" 
Oh where shall I 
row ?" said this indiscreet beau, 
" 
To the chapel that stands very near!" 
So he put her ashore, and for two hours more 
Waited there like a 
sad Gondolier. 
Then he took his guitar, and sung songs to the star; 
Had he sung to his lady instead, 
He'd not seen on the land, coming forth hand in 
hand, 
That couple who'd been to get wed. 
" 
That's cool!" he exclaim'd, "tis myself must be 
blamed, 
Oh! I 
see I've no business here, 
For one ought to beware how one parts with the fare, 
When a

Kate 0, Shane. 
(Music by Geo. Linley.) 
The cold winds of autumn wail mournfully here, 
The leaves round me falling are faded and sere; 
But chill though the breme be, and threat'ning the 
storm, 
My heart full of fondness beats kindly and warm 
ctionus 
Oh Dennis, dear, come back to me 
I 
count the hours away from thee, 
Return and never pait again 
Front thine own darling—Kate 0' Shane. 
'Twas here we last parted, ' twas here we first met, 
And ne'er has he caused me one tear of regret; 
The seasons may alter, their change I 
defy, 
My heart's one glad summer when Dennis is by.

Dennis, dear, &c. 
Air.—"A 
place in thy memory dearest." 
One day by that lake I 
was straying 
In whose waves, as they placidly flow,1 
'Tis said that the old towers of Erin 
May be seen there reflected below; 
I 
thought I 
might venture to peep in, 
When what in the waves should 1 
trace 
But the form of that spalpeen Tint Doolan 
Looking up like a 
thief in my face. 
'Twas Tint looking over my shoulder, 
Though I 
thought I 
was dreaming awake, 
" 
Sure," said he, " there's no ghost of a 
creature 
Save myself in your Irish Lake."

Oh! it's sweet are the waters of Ireland,

The Colleen Bawn. 
Och! Patrick darlin', would you lave me 
To sail across the big salt sea ? 
I 
never thought you'd thus decay° me; 
It's not the truth you're tellin' me! 
Though Dublin is a 
mighty city, 
It's there I 
should be quite forlorn, 
For, poor and friendless, who would pity— 
Left lonely there—your Colleen Bawn ? 
You tell me that your friends are leaving 
The dear green Isle, to cross the main, 
But don't you think they'll soon be grieving 
For dear ould Ireland once again ? 
Can they forget each far-famed river? 
Each hill a 
thousand songs adorn? 
Can you depart from them for ever— 
Could you forget your Colleen Bawn? 
Sure, Patrick, me you've been beguiling, 
Its not my heart you -mane to break, 
Tho' fortune may not now be smiling, 
Your Colleen Bawn you'll not forsake; 
I'll go with you across the sea, dear, 
If brighter days for us won't dawn; 
No matter where our home may be, dear, 
I 
still will be your Colleen Bawn. 
The Fairy's Well. 
A 
minstrel, who lov'd the emerald glade, 
And knotted oak with friendly shade, 
In mid-day heat would go, they tell, 
To the grassy side of a 
fairy's well; 
And there, to the sound of the waters gay, 
Caroll'd a 
rollicking roundelay. 
A maiden who loved, as maidens do, - 
The earth's bright green and heav'ns fair blue 
And the merry birds, on flutt'ring, wing, 
-Went forth in the woods to hear them sing; 
And came by chance, as a 
maiden may, 
Where the minstrel carolled his roundelay.

Their bright eyes met, as bright eyes meet, 
In lonely wood, or crowded street; 
She blushed, as if she were doing wrong, 
The minstrel somehow forgot his song; 
But he asked her Jove: and they named the day 
In a 
very old-fashioned roundelay. 
It seems that a 
caution remains to tell, 
Against singing oft at a 
fairy's well; 
For fays in our music still bear part, 
And play on the strings of a 
tender heart; 
And hence the proverb to elders known, 
It's better to leave the well alone.

The Pauper's Drive. 
There's a 
grim horse-hearse, in a 
jilly round trot— 
To the churchyard a 
pauper is going. I 
wot, 
The road it is roue-h, the hearse has no springs 
And hark to the dirge the sad driver sings 
crtonus. 
Rattle his bones over the stones— 
He's only a 
pauper whom nobody owns. 
Oh, where are the mourners ?— Alas! there are 
none! 
He has left not a 
gap in the world now he's gone-
-Not it tear in the eye of child, woman, or man— 
To the grave with his carcass as fast as you can. 
Rattle his bones, &c. 
What a 
jolting, and cracking, and splashing and 
din! 
The whip, how it cracks! the wheels, how they 
spin! 
How the dirt right and left o'er the hedges is hurl'd I 
The pauper at length, makes a 
noise in the world. 
Rattle his bones,.&c. 
But a 
truce to this strain, for my soul it is sad, 
To think that a 
heart in humanity clad 
Should make like the brute, such a 
desolate end. 
And depart from the world, without leaving a 
friend, 
Bear softly his bones, over the stones 
Though a 
pauper, he's one whom his Maker 
yet owns.

Farewell to thee, Erin, my own beloved Isle, 
Where truth, love, and virtue in all seasons smile ;

possessed, 
All lands shall befriend thee, sweet Isle of- the

come, 
I'll smile at the summons that beckons me home, 
If at last from my cares and my troubles I

Of

WILD DILL, THE 
INDIAN SLAYER. '
Wild Bill 
has the name as a brave and fearless 
Scout and Indian fighter. The Corres-
pondent of the " St. Louis Democrat," 
who attended Gen, Ilancock's recent 
Indian expedition. adds this, to some ot 
his exploits, 
that have appeared in 
HARPER'S M ONTHLY 
" 
Wild Bill who is an inveterate hater 
of the Indians, was also chased by six 
Indians lately, and had quite a 
little ad-
venture with them. Taught by long 
practice with Indians to be always on 
his guard, he never walks out of the 
house without a 
brace of fine revolvers 
slung to his waist: but on an important 
errand, he goes armed to the teeth—and 
woe to the Indians who cross his path. 
No. 4. THE DEATH 
TRAIL

Vividly are these pages filled with the 
doings ot the terrible Regulators of 
Arkansas, (the antetypes of the Vigi-
lance Committees of California.)

horse thieves assassinated the Regula-
tors openly and secretly; but at length, 
the people took vengeance in their own 
hands, and lead by a 
celebrated Indian 
Chief, whose Squaw had been ruthless-
ly maltreated and murdered, they fol-
lowed on the Death Trail ot the villains. 
Some of the incidents are fearfully ter-
rific, such as the vigil of the Indian by 
the corpse of his w 
ffe, and his awful re-
venge upon her slayer, in -.the ruined 
wigwam. 
This book depicts characterldically 
many incidents of border life in His 
Valley of the Mississippi.

na. Every page of this thrilling book

mination of the most interesting plot 
that author ever conceived. The char-
acters are exceedingly natural, and all 
their actions life-like and full of daring 
and vigor. The hot sun of Sonora fills 
their veins with fiery resolution and ex-
' cites them on to deeds of desperation.
