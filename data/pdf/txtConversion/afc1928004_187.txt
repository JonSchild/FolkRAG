Our Native Land is Green, 
E'Rt what yees call green horns, : 
We're only just landed 
From the City of Dublin, 
Afar over the sea; 
Though to be called green, 
We will not stand it, 
Tho' foolish we look 
We know all your ways. 
C 
IIORUS. 
Tho' our native land 'Us green, 
Oh, that's no reason why, 
That we should be called the same, 
Remember that, me boys. 
'Twas not want, nor starvation, 
That brought us amongst you, 
As from our appearances 
That you can see, 
For at home we had plenty, 
'Tis the truth that I 
tells yees, • 
But we lon2ed for to see, 
This lan.1 of the free. 
Tho' our native, 
C. `, 
THE IRISH PAIR, 
blud-a-nounker, dears, 
Arrah, musha, man alive, 
Shure you all can see, 
That we have just arrived, 
From where Patrick he was born. 
Betwixt da3.Iight and morn, 
Ould Ireland's the place I 
mean. 
CHORUS. 
Yes, we are an Irish pair, 
An Irish pair 
From the county of Kildare, 
At a 
wake, a 
dance, 
A 
fight or a 
fair, 
Were always to be found. ) 
Shure Old Ireland is the place, 
For a 
row or a 
wake, 
If you'r(3 not mighty shy, 
Shure they'll blacken up your eyes, 
So look out, me boys, 
If you're not on the right side, 
For the divil is to pay 
When sticks they 1 
t 
fly. 
Yes, we are, Ize;?_,

St, Patrick's Day, 
N
'M going to get drunk, Norah, 
Pray tell me why astorah, 
Sure to-day it is the Seventeenth, 
The day we celebrate, 
In honor of St. Patrick, 
Old Ireland's patron saint. 
't 
CHORUS. 
On St. Patrick's Day, 
We'll march so gay, 
Up the Bowery and down Broadway* 
If we don't have fun, 
The devil's to pay 
On the Seventeenth of March, 
This is the hat I'll wear, 
And ril put on my false hair, 
And as we march together, 
The people they will say, 
There goes an Irish couple, 
That keep St. Patrick's day. 
On St. Patrick's Day, &c.

'PAT AND KITTY. 
COMIC DUET. 
PAT. — Now Kitty dear, my story hear, 
A

You know an honest Irishman, 
Will always have his way; 
tKrrry.—Will always try, that's what you mean, 
I 
know you, do you see, 
Now Mister Pat, do you inoind that, 
You cannot blarney me; 
PAT.— Oh hould yer jaw, and don't you spake, 
About blarneying, to me, 
KTrm—You're a 
fine lad, with lots of gab, 
But you can't play that on me. 
PAT.-011 Kitty, if you don't have me, 
My poor old heart will break, 
Krrry.—Oh sure if you're as bad as that 
Co home, and something take; 
PAT. — I'll take a 
dose of poison cold, 
All for the sake of you. 
11 
Kyrrv.-011 I 
shan't cry a 
bit you fool, 
'Tis the best thing you can do. 
PAT.-011 Kitty dear, have you no heart, 
Krrry.—Get out you foclish elf. 
PAT.—If you've a 
heart, give it to me, 
Kyrry.—I want it all myself. 
PAT.—You're eyes they are like the diamonds, 
Krr-rv.—They're not for they are blue. 
PAT.—You're cheeks they are two roses, 
KIrrY.—Not to be pluck'd by you; 
PAT.—You're lips are like the cherries, 
Krrrv.—But not for you to taste. 
PAT. — You're a 
pretty little angel, 
Krrrv.—And you're an ugly baste. 
PAT.—Oh murther did you hear her then, 
Krrry.—Go away, you clumsy lout, 
PAL-NOW, Kitty darling, only say, 
KrrrY.—Does your mother know you're out 
PAT. — I've got a

Krrry.—Oft of that you've bluster'd, 
Ayr:

PAL—rve got a 
pig,—I've got a 
cow, 
One that gives milk, and custard; 
I've got a 
can, nicely built 
To keep you from all harm, 
And a 
big mattress, stuird wid straw; 
To keep you nice, and warm. 
Krrrr.—Oh Pat, ye have such winning ways 
I

The Tail of My Coat. 
LEARNED my reading and writing at Bally 
naggert, when I 
went to school, 
It was there I 
first took to tighthe wid the school,. 
master, Mr.0' Toole, 
lle'and I 
we had many a 
scrimmage, but the divI1 
a 
copy I 
wrote, 
For there wasn't a 
gossoon in the village could 
stand on the tail of my coat. 
Cnonus. 
Dare stand on the tail of my coat, ah, just tread oa 
the tail of my coat, 
If your in fur a 
row or a 
ruction, just stand on the 
tail of 
coat. 
I 
was an litigant hand, too, at courthf, for lessons 
I 
took in the art,. 
Till cupid, the blackimard, while sporting dhrovit 
an arrow straight through my heart, 
Judy Connor, I 
lived straight forninst her and ten-
der lines to her I 
wrote, 
11 
But the divil a 
boy in the village could stand on 
the tail of my coat. 
Dare stand,&c. 
But a 
big trotter, Mickey Malony, tried for to 
steal her away, 
lie had money and t 
hadn't any, so a 
challenge I 
sent him :lext day 
Next mornir we met at KilMiley, and the Shannon 
we crossed in a 
boat, 
Oh I 
lathered him with my shillelah, for he stood 
on the tail of my coat. 
Dare standAc. 
Now my fame is spread over the counthry, folks 
flocked to gaze upon me, 
['hey all cried out without hesitation your a 
fight-
ing man, Mickey Magee, 
fought with the Finigan faction, and I 
hate al L 
the Murphys afloat 
o 
if your in for a 
belly-go-flsther, just stand on 
the tail of my coat.. 
Dare stand, dz. 
15 
I've traveled through Ulster and Munster, 
kenny, and Connamnt 
It was there when I 
first was a 
youngster, I 
opened 
this pair of brown eyes; 
It's there you'll see fire without smoke; for a 
shil. 
ling you'll buy 50 eggs, 
And the girls they can all take a 
joke there, and 
there is monkeys without any legs. 
Dare stand, Sze. 
VE just arrived from Dublin to-night, 
- and feel quite discontented, 
To see the way we are run down, not fairly 
represented, 
It seems t9 be a 
general rule to make poor Pa; 
a 
moue and fool : 
-0 
But never mind, I'll take it cool, and stick up 
for Old Ireland. 
Cnonus. 
So do me justice, treat me fair, I'll not be dis-
contented, 
Nor yet be snubbed everywhere, when fairly 
represented. 
They say I've dirty and lazy got, but at that 
I'll never 1:,,runi ble, 
Just go and visit an Irish cot, you're welcome 
though it's humble, 
In public works through the country round, in 
railway tunnels or underground, 
Or where hard work is to be found, you'll find 
the boys from Ireland. 
So do me, &c, 
17 
Now there in hisliterature, the cause it grieves 
me sadly. 
Whenever he draws our caricature, he pictures 
us rather badly, 
With crooked legs, and villainous face, he re-
presents the Irish race, 
I'm sure it is a 
sad disgrace, we think so 
Ould Ireland. 
So do me, & c. 
Sure it is very well known, that an Irishman 
is gay and frisity 
I'll own that I'm fond of a 
pretty girl, and I 
like a (.: r(i1) of whiskey, 
ru 
(.1
,) 
what I 
like with what's my own, I'm 
very quiet if let alone. 
But we hate the foes, Och-hone, who dare run 
down old Ireland. 
So do me, &c. 
18 
Pat Won't Go Home Till Morning. 
%HE dawn upon the hill was breaking, t 
e 
(5) 
)M--- 
stars were twinkling in the sky, 
As Pat upon the ground lay dreaming, his big 
shillelah lay close by, 
All night the whiskey he's been drinking, and now 
he wakens from his drunken snore, 
lie calls for drink to make him frisky, and swears 
because there is no more. 
CHORUS. 
Then 1111 up the bowl. hurrah ! for a thirsty soul, 
ha! ha! 
All night on a 
spree, my boys, my throat with 
fire i3 burning, 
Dance so blithe and gay, hurrah! none like Pat 
can be, ha! ha! 
Divil a 
hair I 
care, my boys, we won't go home 
till morning. 
19 
The moon upon the bogs was gleaming, and the 
lambs were bleating in the shed, 
The pigs and sows the swill are raking, and the 
gossons waiting to be fed, 
Pat home from the wake is trudging slowly, with 
divil a 
farthing hi his purse, 
Besides his pockets are both holey, and credit to 
poor Pat not worth a 
curse. 
Then till up, (F(c. 
The night and fun again advances, and the song 
and dance again goes ' round, 
And Pat again is nimbly drinking, until with whis-
key he gets drowned, 
All night he's been swigging at the bottle, and 
now he tumbles flat upon the floor. 
Yet still the boys and girls are &icing, but Pat's 
asleep to dance no more. 
Then fill up, &c.

GRAMACHREE AND PADDY WHACK. 
M ERE was an Irish lad 
Who loved a 
cloistered nun, 
And it made him very sad. 
For what was to be done 
He thought it was a 
big shame, 
A 
most confounded sin, 
That she could not get out at all, 
And he could not get in. 
Yet he went ev'ry day—he could do nohini; 
more, 
Yet he went ev'ry day to the convent door,. 
And he sung sweet, 
smalilou, smalilou, 
smalilou, 
And he sung sweetly, smalilou, gramachree 
and Paddy whack. 
To catch a 
glimpse of her, 
He played a 
thousand tricks; 
The iron bolts he tried to stir, 
And he gave the wall some kicks; 
tam pod, he raved, he sighed, he prayed,' 
And many times he swore, 
Och! the Devil take the iron bolts— 
The Devil take the door, 
Yet he went ey'ry day— he made it a 
rule, 
Yet he went ev'ry day, and he looked like a 
fool, 
Though he sung sweetly smalilon, &c. 
One morn she left her bed, 
Because she could not sleep,1 
And to the window sped, 
To take a 
little peep. 
And what did she do then! 
I'm sure you'll think it right--
She bade the honest lad good day, 
She bade the nuns good night. 
Tenderly she listened to all he had to say, 
Then jumped into his arms, and so they ran 
away, 
And they sung sweetly, smalilou, &e, 
LARRY O'GAFF. 
NEAR a 
bog in sweet, Ireland, I'm told, sure 
that born I 
was, 
Well I 
remember, a 
fine muddy morn it was; 
Father cries out, poor man, what a 
greenhorn 
I 
was, 
Two months I'm married, Nach Hone, how 
' 
they'll laugh! 
" 
Arndt, Katey," says he, " I'll lave you, I 
— swear,'my joy. 
Katey, she cries, " Arrah, devil may care, my 
.. . 1.J 
joy:" •` 
Then by St. Patrick I'll lave you both Mere, 
my joy. 
Ofrin a 
hull goes my father O'Gatl, 
Singing dideroo whack; ofl I 
am 
None of your blarney, ma am: 
Take your brat, to him chat, 
All the day, so you may 
Faith I'll not tarry; then left little Larry, 
Who saw nothing more of his father O'Gall 
Soon I 
grew up, and a 
neat looking chick I 
was, 
Devil's own fellow for twirling the stick I 
was, 
Somehow or other my poor nob so thick it 
was, 
-Go where I 
wou'd ev'ry crater wou'd laugh ; 
To England I 
came, where I 
met wid a 
squad; 
And soon got promoted to carry the hod, 
Trod the ladder as light as a 
horse newly shod, 
Step by step to promotion goes Larry O'GatE 
But it was a 
dideroo whack in and out, 
Head turning round about, 
Up and down, giddy grown, 
Ladder crack, break one's back, 
"Och", says I, " Larry, this hod which yott 
carry," 
Disgraces the shoulder of Mr. O'Gaff." 
I 
got me a 
ma3ter, and dress'd like a 
fop I 
was, 
Bran new, and span new, from bottom to top I 
was; 
Once he popp'd in, just while taking a 
drop I 
was.. 
" 
Larry," says he, " you bog-trotting calf, 
Get out of my house, or 
lay this about your 
back." 
Flourish'd a 
stick, like the mast of a 
herring 
smack, 
Over my napper-in two he this swish did crack. 
Wid a 
whack for old Ireland, 
And Larry O'Gaff. 
SONS OF HIBERNIA. 
BRAVE sons of Hibernia your shamrocks dis-
play, 
For ever made sacred on St. Patrick'S day; 
'Tis a 
type of religion, the badge Of 
And a 
plant of that soil which no venom can 
taint. 
Both Venus and Mars to that land lay a 
claim, 
Their title is own'd and recorded by fame; 
But Saint Patrick to friendship has hallow'd 
the ground, 
And made hospitality ever abound. 
, 
Then with shamrocks as myrtles let us garnish 
the bowl, 
In converse convivial and sweet flow of soul, 
To our saint make oblations of generous wine, 
What saint would have more, sure ' Us worship 
divine. 
Thro' jovial and festive, in seeming exces.s, 
We've hearts sympathetic of other 3' distres.i, 
May our shamrock continue to nourish, and 
prove 
An emblem of charity. friondship, and love. 
May the blight of disunion, no longer remain, 
Our shaniroclzs to wither, its glories to stain; 
May it iloarish for ever, we heaven invoke, 
Kindly shelter'd and fenc'd by the brave British 
oak.

THE GREEN LITTLE SHAMROCK. , 
THERE'S a 
dear little plant that grows in 
our isle, 
'Twas St. Patrick himself, sure that set it 
And the sun on his labor with pleasure did 
smile, 
And with dews from his eyes often wet it. 
It thrives thro' the bog, through the brake, 
thro t the mireland, 
And he called it the dear little Shamrock of 
Ireland, 
CHORUS. 
The sweet little shamrock, the dear little 
shamrock, 
The sweet little, green little shamrock of 
Ireland. 
This dear little plant still grows in our land, 
Fresh and fair as the daughters of Erin, 
Whose smiles can bewitch, whose eyes can 
command, 
In each climate that each shall appear in. 
Arid shine thro' the bog, through the brake, 
' 
e 
thro' the mireland, 
Just like their own dear little shamrock of 
Ireland. 
The sweet little shamrock, &c. 
This dear little plant that springs from our 
soil, 
When its three little leaves are extended, 
Denotes from our stalk we together should 
toil, 
And ourselves by ourselves be befriended. 
And still thro' the boo-, 
through the brake, 
• 
thro' the mireland, 
From one root should branch like the sham-
rock of Ireland.

LANNEGAN'S BALL 
n 
the town of Asthoy lived one Johnny 
Lannegan, 
He battered away till he hadn't a 
pound; 
His father he died, and made him a 
man again; 
He left him a 
farm and an acre of ground, 
He gave a 
large party to all his relations, 
Who didn't forget when sent to the wail; 
If you but listen, 
make your eyes glisten 
At the rows and ructions at Lannegan's Ball. 
Myself, to be sure, got free invitations 
For all the nice girls and boys that I'd ask ; 
In less than a 
minute, his friends and relations 
Were dancing as merry as bees round a 
cask. 
Miss O'Hara, the nice little milliner, 
Tipt me a 
wink to give her a 
call; 
Next we arrived at Timothy Gillegan's, 
Just in time for Lan.legan's Ball. 
There was lashions of whiskey and wine for 
the ladies, 
Pratics and cake, bacon and tea: 
The'Nolans, Dolans and the O'Grady's 
Were kissing the girls and dancing away; 
/Tor songs they were as plenty as water, sure, 
Froa the` -harp that once thraugh Tara'm 
old Hall." 
*Sweet', Nelly, Gray" and the "Ratcatcher's 
daugliter" 
Were dancing in couples at Lannegan's 
ph! there was all sorts of nonsensical dancing, 
All around the room; in a 
neat whirligig; 
But Judy and I 
soon banished their nonsense, 
For, 'we lept them a 
step of a 
neat Irish jig';' 
Och, Mavourneen! wasn't she fond of me! 
We danced till you'd think the old ceiling 
would fall; 
Sure, we spent a 
whole week at Daly's academy:': 
Learning a 
step for Lannegan'es Ball. 
The boys they got gay, and the girls ther,got 
frisky, 
All dancing together in couples and groups, 
Till 
an 
accident 
happened young Briaii-
O'Shaughnessy: 
Re stuck his right foot through Miss Ha-
gerty's hoops; 
51 
The creature roared-apd bawled mealylmurthet 
t 
She roared for her friends, till she gathered 
them all, 
Ned II -rding he swore he wouldn't go further 
Till lie had satisfaction at Lannegan's Bell. 
In the midst of the row,- Miss Cavenagh fainted' 
Her cheeks all the time as red as a 
rose; 
The lad:e3 declared her cheeks they ,
-were 
painted, 
But she'd taken a 
small drop, too much, 1 
suppose; 
Bi; Ned Courtenay, so heavy and able; 
When he saw his dear Colleen stretcheA 
down, by the wi,11, 
He pulled the best leg from under the table, 
And broke all the china at Lannegan's Ball 
Oh ! Moody wars and there was the ructions, 
, 
Myself got a 
clout from Phelin McCue, 
I 
soon replied to his kind invitations, 
-, I 
kicked up the devil's own philimaloo. 
Ould easy, the piper, he nearly got strangled, 
We bundled him up, pipes, chaunter and all, 
The ladies in ribband.-,

TIM FINIGAN'S WAKE. 
As Sung by Bryant's Minstrels. 
FDTIGAN lived in Walker street, 
Te!!" 
A gentleman Irishman—mighty odd— 
He'd a 
beautiful brogue, so rich and sweet, 
And to rise in the world he carried the hod; 
But you see he'd a 
sort of a 
tippling way. 
With a 
love for the liquor poor Tim was born, 
And to help him through his work each day. 
He'd a 
drop of the creatur' every morn. 
Chants. 
Whack, hurrah, blood and ' ounds, ye sowl ye 
Welt the flure, ye're totters shake. 
Isn't it the truth I've told ye, 
Lots of fun at Finigan's wake. 
One morning Tim was rather full, 
His head felt heavy which made him shake, 
He fell from a 
ladder and broke his skull ; 
So they carried him home his corpse to wake; 
They rol'ed him up in a 
nice clean sheet 
And laid him out etz;on the bed, 
With fourteen candles round his feet, 
And a 
couple of dozen around his head. 
Whack, hurrah, etc, 
His friends assembled at his wake. 
Missus Pinigan called out for the lunch; 
First they laid in tay and cake, 
Then pipes and tobacky and whiskey punch 
Miss Biddy O'Brien began to cry: 
Such putty corpse did ever you see, 
Arrah! Tim avourneen, an' why did ye die ? 
Ocii, none of your gab, sez Judy Magee. 
Whack, hurrah, etck 
Then Peggy O'Connor took up the job, 
Arrah, Biddy says she, ye'er wrong I'm sure, 
But•Juddy then gave her a 
belt on the gob, - 
I 
left her sprawling on the flure. 
Each side in war did soon engage: 
'Twas woman to woman and man to man; 
Shillelah law was all the rage, 
And a 
bloody ruction soon began. 
Whack, hurrah, etcs 
Mickey Mulvaney raised his head, 
When a 
gallon of whiskey flew at him 
It missed him—and hopping on the bed, 
The liquor scattered over Tim! 
Bedad! he revives ! see how he raises! 
An' Timothy jumping from the bed, 
" 
Cried while he lathered around like blazus, 
- 
Bad luck to yer souls d've think I'm dead ? 
Whack, hurrah, at!,

DARBY WGUIRE , 
SOME say 'twas in England I 
first saw the light, 
And others in Scotland would have my first night 
But, as writers on heroes are often astray, 
I 
think for myself I'll have something to say. 
Oh! the night I 
was born, sure I 
very well know, 
When the clergyman tumbled in, covered with 
snow; 
He laid hold of myself, and sat down by the fire, 
And made a 
good boy of young Darby ll'Guire. 
CHORUS. 
Then hurrah for Ould Ireland, the land of my 
birth! 
'Tis there you'll get plenty of pleasure and mirth,. 
Where the beautiful girls are sure to admire 
Such rollieksome fellows as Darby rGuire. 
; 
From christ'nings to weddings what heavenly 
bliss, 
As I 
stand by the hide and obtain the first Ids's, 
While the creature looks sly as if nothing oe-
cured, 
And the husband looks daggers, but daren't say 
a 
word; 
5S 
Och! then, for, the carving of praties and pigs! 
The piper begins to " rattle the jigs," 
The girls they jump up, and begin to perspire 
At the pleasure of dancing with Darby M'Guire, 
Then hurrah, &c. 
For twenty miles round, at a 
market or fair, 
I'm sure to be.found, if I 
don't be elsewhere; 
I'm just on the spot when a 
row is begun, 
And I'm smashing away for the sake of the fun. 7

Then hurrah, ttc. 
But, speaking of rows, I 
don't wish to offend, 
For I'm always the boy to assist a 
poor friend; 
Though first in the field, and not last in a 
row, 
can mind number one, and look after the 
plough. 
Some paint ragged Pat with a

Upon a

Where lovely, fair, and tender, 
Is she whom. I 
adore; 
May heaven, its blessings sparing, 
On her bestow them free, 
The lovely maid of Erin, 
Who sweetly sang to me. 
Had fortune fix'd my station, 
In some propitious hour 
The monarch of a 
nation, 
Endowed with wealth and power. 
That wealth and power sharing, 
My peerless queen should be 
The lovely maid of Erin, 
Who sweetly sang to me.

Although the restless Ocean, 
May long between us roar, 
Yet while my heart has motion

And mild and young is she,

Fond hope my bosom cheering,

Who sweetly sang to me. 
KATE KEARNEY: 
0 DID you not hear of Kate Kearney ? 
She lives on the banks of Killarney, 
From the glance of her eye, shun danger-
and fly, 
For fatal's the glance of Kate Kearney. 
For that eye is so modestly beaming, 
You'd ne'er think of mischief she's, dream-
ing, 
Yet, oh ! I 
can tell, how fatal's the spell, 
.,,That lurks in the eye of Kate Kearney. 
Oh, should you e'er meet this Kate Kear-
ney 
Who lives on the banks of Killarney, 
Beware of her smile, for many a 
wile 
Lies hid in the smile of Kate Kearney. 
Though she looks so bewitchingly simple, 
There's music in every dimple; 
And who dares inhale her mouth's spicy-, 
gale, 
, 
Mugi die by the breath of Kate Kearney.

NELLY CAREY. 
bewitching little fairy 
Is bright-eyed Nelly Carey, 
With a 
form so light and airy, 
That it seems the earth to scorn! 
With her silken tresses streaming 
Down, in golden ripples gleaming: 
Oh! they flash like sunlight beaming 
On a 
field of ripening corn. 
And yet, there's no denying 
That in spite of all my siping, 
My hopes are from me flying 
Is the dew before the morn.

She's as clever as she's pretty, 
she's as arch as she is witty; 
But her smile, ah! more's the pity ! 
Lake the summer shines on all, 
Shines on all-With equal sweetness, 
Passes all with equal fleetness, 
How I'd worship her discreetness, 
If on me alone would fall:

To better my fortune I've crossed the big sea,

And, Faith! I'm as wretched as wretched

I

The beautiful halls, and the emerald plain: 
And, au ! don't I 
oftentimes thilik myself crazy 
About the black-eyed rogue, Nora McShane. 
I 
sigh for the turf- pile so cheerfully burning, 
When, bare-

trudged in from toiling 
afar, 
When I 
tossed in the light thirteen I'd been 
earning, 
And whistled the anthem of: Erin go Bragh 
In truth, I 
believe that I'm half broken-
hearted: 
To my country and love I 
must get back 
again, 
For, I've never been happy at ad since I 
parted 
From sweet Ballymornach and Nora McShane. 
Oh! there's something so dear in the cot I 
was 
born in, 
Tho' the walls are but mud and the roof is 
but thatch! 
How familiar the grunt of the pigs in the 
morning! 
What music in lifting the rusty old latch ! 
'Tis true I'd no money, but then I'd no sorrow:

But warmly as ever my heart beats for thee.

Long years have passed o'er us since the last

The bright eyes that shone 
Like stars in the heaven of days that are gone, 
Oh! " Cushla Ma,chree" & e.

WHY CAN'T PADDY BE A 
GENTLEMAN? 
Words by George Cooper. 
ZIT WAS told that Pat couldn't be a 
gentleman; so I've set myself the 
task, 
That I 
to-night the reason why—of you 
my friends would ask; 
ilasn't Ireland her colleges that have for 
centuries stood 
To teach the people ? and you know, the 
tEaching, mighty good. 
Haven't Irishmen got heads and hearts! 
Bedad I 
know that's so; 
Then why can't Paddy be a 
gentleman? 
That's what I 
want to know. 
Spoken—I 
should like to see it denied. 
Look at the record and you'll never 
ask— 
A4-•

74 
Why can't Paddy be a 
gentleman ; a 
gen-
tleman, a 
gentleman— 
Why can't Paddy be a gentleman? 
That's what I 
want to know. 
If Paddy's not a 
gentleman, I'd like to 
know who is ? 
You cannot give a 
reason why—each 
manly trait is his; 
He's always first to help a 
friend, al 
though his means are scant, 
And tho' he's fond of blarney, he hates 
deceit and cant. 
His onat may be of common frieze, his, 
heart won't freeze, oh, no! 
Theh why can't Paddy be a 
gentleman ? 
That's what I 
want to know. 
Spoken—If you know, tell me— 
Why can't Paddy, etc. 
Just read the Irish history, and in that 
same you'll find 
Great deeds of Irish crentlemen—St-
r, 
Patrick's one d'ye mind? 
If great deeds then, ennoble men, ah, 
worrah sure, it's. true, 
Pat shows as long a 
list, my boys, as any 
one can do. 
And dOn't forget this, ye who sneer at 
honest Paddy's worth, 
that actions make the gentleman, no 
matter what the birth. 
Spoken—Sure, none of you can tell 
no— 
Why can't Paddy be a 
gentleman? 
A 
gentleman, a 
gentleman! 
Why can't Paddy be a 
gentleman? 
That's what I 
want to know!

Where all the boys are blithe and free, deny it if 
you can. 
Ould Ireland is the place where they're famed for 
fun and mirth, 
It's equal can't be found if you search all o'er the

Good natured boys and girls are there, with none 
of them you can compare, 
Where every heart is free from care, that makes 
an Irish boy.

PADDY'S LAND. 
Composed and sung by Johnny Roach. 
'OMB all ye boys of Paddy's land, 
who are inclined to roam, 
To reap the English harvest so far away 
from home, 
Be sure you're well provided with com-
rades bold and true, 
Por you have to fight, both day and 
night, ' gc.inst John Bull and his crew. 
Then hurrah, my boys, for Paddy's land, 
'Tis the land I 
do adore, 
May heaven smile on every child 
That loves that shamrock shore. 
When we left home for Dublin, the 
morning it being clear, 
And when we got on board the boat, we 
gave three hearty cheers, 
Saying: Good- bye, my 
boys, to that dear 
old land, we ne'er may see it more, 
For we're going to fight, both day and 
night, all for that shamrock shore. 
Then hurrah, my boys, etc. 
We sailed away from Dublin Quay, and 
ne'er received a 
shock, 
Until we landed in New York, long side 
of the dock, 
Where thousands of our countrymen 
they were all in that town, 
And " Fagh a 
ballagh, clear the track!" 
were the words that passed all round 
Then hurrah, my boys, etc. 
Then away we went in merriment t,o 
drink bourbon and wine, 
Each lad he gave his favorite toast for 
the girl he left behind; 
We sat and sang, made the ale-house 
ring, despising Erin's foes, 
Or any man that hates the land where 
St. Patrick's shamrock grows. 
Thcn hurrah, my boys, etc.

Paddy Connor's Wake. 
As sung by Archy Hughes, of Hooley's 
Minstrels. 
OW Paddy Connor died 
" 
Just as the day was breaking, 
his friends they all assembled, 
Quite dacently to wake him. 
A 
score of Paddy's friends, 
They dropped in unawares, 
And sat down on the top of the floor, 
Because there was no chairs. 
Now young and old, none with 
fear be shak-in', 
Men with courage bold, at Pad-
dy Connor's wakin'. 
There was little dumpty Mike, 
Tim Murphy and his brother, 
And there was Dill Barlow, 
And also was his mother. 
There was Toni Gassoon, 
(Shure wasn't he the bold on F) 
Had on a 
shirt bran new, 
Made out of his father's old one. 
Now young and old, etc. 
There was a 
row began, 
The whiskey it was boiling, 
Eyes there were punched out, 
And children they were squalling. 
The coffin got capsized 
With a 
pot or a 
big paver, 
The corps6 got two black eyes— 
Oh! bad luck to such behavior I 
Now young and old, etc._

PADDY IS THE BOY. 
It's some years ago, I 
very well know, 
Since I 
first saw day- light with my two blessed eyes 
I was born, so they say, when my Dad was away, 
On St. Patrick's day, in the morning. 
How they nursed me with joy, said, what a 
fine boy! 
Put a 
stick in my fist, by the way of a 
toy; 
Faith! there's no mistake, they admired my make, 
And said some day Ed give the girls a 
warming. 
Clionus: For, Paddy is the boy that's fond of a 
glass. 
Paddy is the boy that's fond of a 
lass! 
Dear Old Dublin is the place for me, 
And Donnybrook is the place to go tot p 
spree I 
At a 
wake or a 
fair, poor Paddy is there; 
lie will fight foe or friend, if they do him offend; 
Let the piper strike np—he will rise from his cup; 
With a 
smile on his face adorning, 
With his little Colleen, he'll dance on the green; 
Sure, an Irishman, there, in his glory was seen: 
Play a 
reel or a 
jig, he don't care a 
5g: 
But he'll dance till day- light, in the morning. 
CUOREB: For Paddy is t!e boy that's fond of a 
glass, 
Paddy is the boy that's fond of a 
lass! 
Dear Old Dublin is the place for me, 
And Donnybrook is the place to go for s, 
spree! 
sow, boys, do you mind: you neve. will find 
Such a 
dear little place as the Emerald Isle; 
Long, long may it stand, and good luck to the land. 
That dear Old St. Patrick was born in !— 
May the girls, young and old, may the boys, brave and 
bold, 
Unite, heart and band, to protect the dear Isle 
And, morn, noon and night, may joy and delight 
Shine on them, like a 
flue Summer's morning!

GOOD-BYE JOHN:: 
:was on a 
Friday morning I 
Bid Gotham City good-bye, 
The wind it blow'd great guns, my boys. 
And the water ran sky high. 
As waved my ncw Bandana, to 
My Nancy on the shore, 
She sobb'd and sigli'd and wept and cried, 
When I 
sailed for Singapore. 
SPOKEN—Ay, lads, and weepingly she cried, 
CHORES. 
Good bye, John, now don't stop long, 
But come back soon to your own Chickabiddy. 
For my heart beats so, when the winds do blow, 
That takes away my sailor. 
Sweet Nancy was a 
lass,my boys, 
Of fifteeen stone full weight, 
Iler face— it was a 
face, my boys, 
Like a 
good size dinner plate. 
She kept a 
sweet-stuff shop, my boys, 
'Twould your eyes do good to see, 
sold Lollypops and Tom Thumb's drops, 
But nought so sweet as she. 
SPOKEN—And her last words were 
Good-bye, John, Sm. 
Whcn I 
saird for foreign parts I'd bring 
Back presents to my love, 
Such Injin Hats and Turkish Mats, 
Or a 
Chinese Turtle Dove. 
Sweet Nancy would write me billey doos, 
Which took away my breath, 
She said as how she loved her John, 
With kind regards till death. 
So loving. 
UPOKEN.—And at the bottom of the billy doin 
shit. used to put P. S.

To see me ould mother and Dublin once more. 
Gnoaus—Then Mister McGlynn, when at home 
in Dublin, 
Will welcome you all at his new cabin door. 
I've found many cronies amongst the Malonys. 
And often drank whiskey wid Phelim O'Toole; 
O'Brien and McNielly and poor Miles O'Reilly 
Were all of us sprung when we waked Tim

Con Donahue. 
Pathetic Baltad sung by FRA-NIC G 
vrros. 
n 
Jersey city there once did dwell, 
A 
butcher unknown to fame, 
Be fell in love with a 
nice young gal, 
And he was not very much for to blame. 
His name it was Con Donahue, 
And her's was Biddy McCord, 
She was daughter-in-law to the soap fat maa, 
That lived in the fourteenth ward. 
Now Con he loved her with all his might, 
And he thought that she loved him the same 
He took her to the theatre one benefit night, 
Which caused him all his pain. 
For she saw a 
young man in the pit, 
That did her heart ensnare, 
And she fell in love with his black mustacheo 
And curly auburn hair. 
When Con came to hear the news, 
His heart began to falter, 
Says he I 
will go like a 
hero hold, 
And join the Sons of Malta.. 
But the thoughts of his cold hearted loT*. 
Did shortly mark his gills, 
And he killed hintAelf in a slaughter house, 
With a 
box of Brandreth's pills. 
THE SPRIG OF SHILLELAH. 
Ocrt, love is the soul of a 
nate Irishman! 
Ile loves all that is lovely, loves all that he can, 
With his sprig of shillelah and shamrock so 
green. 
His heart is good humored—'tis honest and 
No malice or hatred is there to be found: 
He courts and he marries, he drinks and he 
fights, 
For love, all for love, for in that he delights, 
With a 
sprig of s'iillelah and shamrock so green. 
Who has e'er had the luck to see Donnybrook 
Fair! 
An Irishman all in his glory 13 there, 
With his spri. , of shillelah and shamrock so 
green, 
His chthes spick and span new, without e'er a.

down. 
At evening returning, as homeward he goes, 
us heart sofe with whiskey, his head soft with 
blows, 
From a

He meets with his Shelah, who blushing a 
smile, 
Get you gone, Pat," yet consents all the 
while: 
To the priest then they go—and nine months 
after that 
A 
fine baby cries out, " How dye do, father Pat." 
With your sprig of shillelah, 
Bless the country, says I, that gave Patrick his 
birth, 
Bless the land of the oak, and its neighboring 
earth 
Where grows the shillelah, and shamrock so 
green; 
May the sons of the Thames, the Tweed, and the 
Shannon 
Drub the foe who dares plant on our confines a 
cannon: 
United and happy, at loyalty's shrine. 
May the rose, and the thistle, long flourish and 
twine 
Round a 
sprig of shillelah and shamrock so 
green.

7„1- 7F I 
formrear the Art Divine 
Which deifies the dead— 
What comfort, then, can I 
call mine, 
What solace seek instead ? 
For from my birth our country's fax 
Was life to me, and love, 
And for each loyal Irish name 
Some garland still I 
wove. 
I'd rather be the bird that sings 
Above the martyr's grave, 
Than fold in fortune's cage my wings 
And feel my soul a 
slave. 
I'd rather turn one simple verse 
True to the Gtelic ear, 
Than sapphic odes I 
might rehearse 
With Senates list'ning near. 
Oh, Native Land : dost ever mark, 
When the world's din is drown'd, 
112 
Betwixt the daylight and the dark 
A 
wandering solemn sound, 
That on the western wind is borne 
Across thy dewy breast ? 
It is the voice of those who mourn 
For thee, far in the West: 
For them and theirs, I 
oft essay 
Your ancient art of song, 
Aild often sadly turn away 
Deeming my rashness wrong; 
For well I 
ween, a 
loving will 
Is all the art I 
own, 
Ah, me! could love suffice for skill, 
What triumphs I 
had known 
My Native Land, my Native Land, 
Live in my memory still 
Break on ray brain, ye surges grand I 
Stand up, mist-covered hill! 
&ill in the mirror of the mind 
The land I 
love I 
see, 
Would I 
could fly on the western wind, 
My Native Land, to thee!
