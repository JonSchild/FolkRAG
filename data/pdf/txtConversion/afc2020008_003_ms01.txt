Jason Schuler interviewed by Vyta Pivo on May 24, 2021 at the Lehigh Cement Company 
Plant in Nazareth, Pennsylvania. The interview transcript has been edited for clarity.  
 
[00:00:00] 
 
Vyta Pivo: 
So, today is Monday, May 24th, 2021. This is an interview for the occupational 
history archive, which is part of the Folklife Center at the Library of Congress, funded by the 
Archie Greene Fellowship. As part of this project, I am interviewing cement workers in the 
Lehigh Valley, Pennsylvania, the birthplace of the modern cement industry in the United 
States. The recording and transcript will become part of the permanent collection at the 
Library of Congress. I'm Vyta Pivo and today I'm speaking with Jason Schuler at the Lehigh 
Cement Company Nazareth Plant in Nazareth, Pennsylvania. And just to confirm, you, give 
me your permission to record the interview, is that right?  
 
Jason Schuler:  
I do.  
 
VP: 
Excellent, thank you. So, could you tell me your full name, your year of birth, and 
where you were born?  
 
JS: 
Jason Schuller. I was born --- -- 1972, in Easton, Pennsylvania. Right down the road.  
 
VP: 
Down the road.  
 
JS: 
Yes.  
 
VP: 
And is that where you grew up?  
 
JS: 
Yeah. Yeah. In the local area my whole life.  
 
VP: 
When did you first learn about the cement and concrete industries?  
 
JS: 
Oh, I probably learned about it a few years prior to work, to coming in here to work. I, 
I had friends that worked here, other cement industries. It's a localized thing here, just where 
we have the limestone, you know. So, I didn't really, I drove by this road, you know, this 
plant has been here since the late 70s. So, I drove by, you know, when I was a kid, had my 
driver's license. We this was our rival high school right here, Nazareth. So, you know, I drove 
past this hundreds of times and never really asked or knew what it was. I just drove by. And 
then obviously, you know, in my upper 20s come here to work. And it's like, wow, you had 
no clue what was going on behind those pine trees there.  
 
VP: 
So, how did you decide to come to this plant?  
 
JS: 
At the time I was laying tile, I was doing concrete work on the side. And I, I just had 
an opportunity to get a job here, not knowing what everything entailed, you know, not 
knowing I'm 20-22 years later, I would be here still. So, it's a unique industry and it's very 
different once you start learning about it, it's pretty neat.  
 
VP: 
So, what job did you start with?  
2 
 
 
JS: 
Well, we all start out as laborers when you get hired and then you can bid on other 
jobs. Sometimes when there's guys when people retire and there's jobs open, they sort of 
force the younger guys, the laborers, the young, the young guys on new jobs. And I was on 
the utility job and the bulk loading job. And then I've been on the shift technician job, which 
is an electrical technician, mechanical pretty much, and then started working swing shifts 
since then, early 2000s.  
 
VP: 
So, could you tell me what the labor job you had involves?  
 
[00:03:07] 
 
JS: 
The labor job involves a lot of different things, your operating forklifts and bobcats 
cleaning up jackhammering, shoveling. Yeah, it's labor intensive for sure. So, it's for most 
people, it's a job to learn the place. And then you want to get a higher paying, less physically 
demanding job, although in a cement plant there is hardly any jobs that aren't physically 
demanding.  
 
VP: 
And so how many hours did you work per week?  
 
JS: 
Yeah, sometimes it was 40 and then depending on the needs of the plant, that's when 
there'd be overtime. And now for the like the last 10 years, there's been overtime because I 
think all companies do the same thing. They want to operate with less people, get the same 
amount of work done with less bodies. And I think it's more efficient to pay overtime than to 
over hire. And then you have to lay people off. So, it's a good thing not to have layoffs.  
 
VP: 
And did you get training from other workers?  
 
[00:04:05] 
 
JS: 
Oh, yeah. You have to absorb the experience and the knowledge from guys that have 
been here a while. A lot of these guys in Nazareth, they went to high school in Nazareth and 
they just came to the cement plant because their brothers or cousins or dad worked here. And 
it was sort of like the evolution of a family thing. And most people work here, live local 
because you don't really want to have to travel if you work long hours, you don't want to have 
to travel long distance.  
 
VP: 
So, does your family work in the industry?  
 
JS: 
No, no, no. But I did get my brother a job here when his he was in a technology 
division at Agere Industries and then they folded up. So, I got him a job here. And now he's 
actually my supervisor, which is funny.  
 
VP: 
What is that like to work with your siblings? 
 
JS: 
It's good we get a lot done, me and my brother. But sometimes you argue, you know, 
but it is fun. It's nice to be able to work with them and work the same shift because then we 
can, you know, spend time together. I can get to see my niece and nephew and outside of 
work because it's a scheduling. It's a very hard schedule to work at a cement plant no matter 
what job you have. It's a 24/7, 365 operation. It's not logical to shut the count down, you 
3 
 
know, for holidays. We have to keep it running. And so that's one of these things here where 
it's like it's almost like working, you would call it like a firefighter or a cop or working at a 
nuclear power plant. It's 24/7, there's always got to be somebody manning the operation. So 
that's the demanding and hard part of the job because spending quality time with your family, 
friends, traveling, whatever you want to do, it revolves around your work schedule and it's 
sometimes it's pretty grueling.  
 
VP: 
So, could you tell me more about what jobs have which schedules or how they’re 
stacked?  
 
JS: 
The shift jobs are production, which means, you know, we're around the clock. You 
have a group of guys, utility man, a technician, central control operator and equipment 
operator. So, there's four guys on each job and we cover, we'll do seven night shifts, have a 
couple of days off to seven middle shifts, have a day off to seven day shifts, then have four 
and a half off. And it's like a 28 day rotation.  
 
VP: 
So, it's never the same hours, basically.  
 
JS: 
Well, it's days, middles and night shift, so you can look ahead for your schedule under 
normal circumstances, but we're shorthanded now, so I do 7-12 hour nights have 3 days off, 
7-12 hour days have 4 days off. And it just rotates like that every 3 weeks.  
 
VP: 
So. So, what is your job now, what do you do?  
 
[00:06:59] 
 
JS: 
I'm still an electrical shift technician, which means I maintain the plant, I inspect 
things, I electrically repair things, mechanically, lubrication. And just overall, knowing the 
process, there's so much here to know and about 8000 pieces of equipment to tend to, you 
know, in the plant between here and our other side of town where we have a quarry and we 
have a two mile belt line that runs and brings a stone over to us. So, there's a lot to tend to.  
 
VP: 
Did you have to get additional education?  
 
JS: 
We did. We have schooling here. We did before it was available. Classes are available 
now at the community colleges that we send people to. But I had to do it online like a course 
online, a computer. And we did get some training. But a lot of the knowledge you learn from 
the guys here from being trained directly, that's a big part of it, passing knowledge on 
because it's such a unique industry that it's not like anything else. It's very weird.  
 
VP: 
Why do you think it's so different?  
 
JS: 
Because most places can shut down for holidays. And what we do here is we have an 
operation that's just ongoing. We're just steady all the time. And most people don't understand 
that. And we work in three feet of snow, pouring down rain, you know what I mean? You're 
still here working. It's not, even during Hurricane Sandy, I think it was, I was without power 
for four days. So, we you know, we still were open. We have a substation that when the town 
could lose power, we still have power. And even if we lost power temporarily, we have 
backup generators that generate enough power to keep the essential things running.  
 
4 
 
VP: 
For how long could they keep running?  
 
JS: 
As long as we have enough fuel for the generator, it turns the kiln because when the 
kilns hot, you can't stop turning. It cools. You have to continue to spin it. We call it inching 
it. It goes at a real slow speed.  
 
VP: 
And that's the most important element to keep running? 
 
JS: 
Yeah, yeah. Even see, now we're down. We have a bearing we have to replace and 
we've been cooling for like fourteen hours, spinning it slowly, slowly letting the heat out so 
the refractory doesn't, it's not compromised, it doesn't break. And the refractory’s brick, kiln 
brick this thick that goes in. Yeah, heat resistant brick you could call it. And it's lined on the 
whole inside of that kiln. And sure if Ed Pany told you that the kilns are just, you know, the 
one of them, that's the most important part of the operation. That's the heart of the operation.  
 
VP: 
And so do you, there’s only one kiln here, right? Do you maintain them in multiple 
plants or do you just focus on Nazareth?  
 
JS: 
No, just here. We have specialty people that probably go between plant to plant. See, 
this operation was built in the late 1970s. Lehigh actually took over like maybe 2014, I think. 
I don't know all the exact dates. So, I mean, cement industry is the same no matter who, no 
matter what company is in charge, it's a very unique operation. 
 
VP: 
And so, your skill set doesn't have to be connected to specific plant as well? 
 
JS: 
No, I guess if you wanted to move and relocate and there was a cement plant nearby 
and you applied and interviewed, they could hire you and bring you right over and decide if 
you want to keep your seniority or, because you are working with Lehigh, if it was Lehigh 
and a lot of people just move to other cement plants and other, they go to other industries and 
then come back here.  
 
VP: 
So, tell me about a typical day. What does your schedule looks like. So, you have 
three shifts and how does your work change over the shifts?  
 
[00:10:56] 
 
JS: 
Well, they're all the same because you're checking the same equipment repetitively. 
You're adding oil to things that leak or burning oil. So, everything here, everything here is in 
a process. So, you could call it like a line, starts from here and goes to here. Now to get from 
here to here, to get from stone in the quarry to cement in a truck, it goes through a huge 
process, a lot of things have to go right. So, it's just important that everything has to run in 
logical order. If one thing stops in the middle of your stream, then you don't get your product 
and everything behind it has to stop. So, you're sort of like, you know, everything has to be 
asked to run and everything has to come together.  
 
VP: 
So, what machines do you specifically check?  
 
JS: 
Conveyors, we have roller mills, we have a ball mill. These are metal tables with huge 
rolls that crush the material. And then a classifier, which is a huge fan, pulls the material up 
and that's how we transfer the material. And then we use drag conveyors and screws and we 
5 
 
use large fans and bag houses and dust collectors, which process the material. We have 
holding tanks, storage tanks, homogenizing tanks. We have a lot of things going on here.  
 
VP: 
So, you check all of these every single day?  
 
JS: 
Yeah, every shift. We have areas to check. And then the neat thing about a cement 
plant is also the crazy thing. The plant will dictate your day, like as things break down or 
things need to be maintained. That's sort of what you know what I mean, you're being called 
to or you're addressing when everything is running smoothly, which is rare in a cement plant. 
But if it does, then it's more of inspecting to make sure that when we, when we something 
happens, we can fix it or we can fix it before it breaks. It's sort of it's like a huge machine that 
you have to keep running, a huge process.  
 
VP: 
So, which things break down most often? 
 
[00:13:00] 
 
JS: 
It's just very random because as things age or, you know, things aren't replaced. So, it 
is very random. And then we have like, a few months we'll have something that's a problem 
and we're trying to, before we can order a new one or for a new one is actually here we have 
to order, and it might be two months out on the lead time of getting it here or finishing it 
wherever it's hot. So, you have like huge gearboxes, half the size of this room or 600 
horsepower motor that may not be available for a month, you know, so we've got to, like, 
make things last because you can't just shut down because like I said, when the process shuts 
down somewhere, everything behind it shuts down. Everything in front of it has no material 
to run. So, you're sort of just empty. The goal is to run the kiln and make clinker and then 
grind that clinker nonstop.  
 
VP: 
So, you really have to anticipate when the parts might fall apart?  
 
JS: 
Yeah, yeah. We have to anticipate what may what is going to break down or what 
needs to be replaced at certain times when you can plan your shutdowns, which we always do 
in the winter, because we're slow as far as cement sales, nobody's buying a lot of cement in 
the winter because you can't put it outside, you can only do it indoors or I guess the 
customers stock it up for the spring, but … so, we do a lot of our big maintenance in the 
winter, January, February.  
 
VP: 
What types of tools do you use?  
 
JS: 
Every kind of wrench you could imagine, pliers, screwdrivers, electrical meters, pipe 
wrenches, sledgehammers, drifts pretty much into mechanic’s toolset, every tool you can 
imagine, just anything. 
 
VP: 
Do you make your own tools? 
 
JS: 
Sometimes there is things that we have to make to make things work, like we'll take 
the head of a wrench and put a long thing on it, welded on because you have to get into an 
area where you can't, have to be a few feet away or, so we do stuff like that, stuff that’s just 
for the plant.  
 
6 
 
VP: 
So, do you take that to another place or do you have someone who can do it in-house? 
 
JS: 
Sometimes we can do it here and other times we can get stuff ordered, specialty tools 
for specialty items, you know, for maybe something that was made in France or Germany. 
We get a lot of parts from Europe on some of our equipment. The original design was, you 
know, from whatever.  
 
VP: 
So, is there a machine shop?  
 
JS: 
Yes, yes, we have a machine shop over here, but we have a local place that basically 
services all the cement industry that makes parts and fabricates specialty things for you, stuff 
that you just couldn't do here.  
 
VP: 
So, you mentioned you work as part of a team, sets of four, right? You work as part of 
a four people team?  
 
[00:16:04] 
 
JS: 
Yeah, yeah. When you're on right now, you have someone in Central, you have your 
supervisor, who's your director, he's the process control supervisor, PCS, and the central 
control operator technician, myself, and two utility men. One is more of an equipment 
operator, one is more of a, we call him a foot guy, and he moves material. He's sledge 
hammering, he's, you know, it's very everything here is very laborious. It's hard work, it’s 
demanding and stressful.  
 
VP: 
So, you work in different parts of the plant.  
 
JS: 
Mhm. 
 
VP: 
So, do you work when you were checking equipment do you work with someone else 
or you’re on your own?  
 
JS: 
Um, we're on our own. We have our two-way radios and now with modern 
technology, obviously, everyone's got a cell phone and sometimes it's easier to talk on the 
phone, go to a quiet place and explain something as instead of putting it over the two-way 
radio.  
 
VP: 
And then you alert another team that something is breaking down?  
 
JS: 
Yes. Or I alert the boss and we'll come up and we'll figure out what we can do or if we 
have to call people because we don't have maintenance and electrical. They're your support 
departments, labor, maintenance, electrical, lubrication, and we're called production. We all 
work together, you know what I mean? But it's just different departments. There's the 
production is here 24/7. The other departments are mostly days, a few middle shifts. And 
then, you know, there would be call guys get called out. So, they have like a company phone. 
People are on call for a scheduled time a week, you know, and they would get called out in 
the middle of the night and have to come out, make repairs. So, and a lot of my day is spent 
doing lock outs and tag outs and safety pulling switches. So, equipment is deenergized so 
people can work on it.  
 
7 
 
VP: 
So, what's involved in doing that?  
 
[00:17:58] 
 
JS: 
We have our switchgear rooms, we have different switchgear rooms that control 
different areas of the plant and I have to go in and deenergize it and lock it out and make a 
box up so that if you were to go work on, say, this thing over here, I would say, OK, this is 
locked out, this is what you're safe to work on and then you can go about your job knowing 
that it's safe, because that's my part of, that's a big part of my job is safety and making sure 
everything's locked out and deenergized before people work on it. So, that's the big part of 
my job. And we wire up motors and replace, you know, there's so many pumps and motors 
here. There's just everything is electric or air or hydraulic. But essentially the air is produced 
from compressors that are electric. So, it's like everything.  
 
VP: 
Do you have accidents at all? I mean, it seems like a dangerous job.  
 
JS: 
Well, we don't we, things happen where somebody might fall on some clinker on the 
ground, you know what I mean? Or something like that. But we don't, it's heavy industry. 
You're always going to have a little nick on your finger or something like that. It's not the 
kind of job we're going to, you're never going to bump your knee or bump your head. It's just 
the way it's the way it is.  
 
VP: 
So, you want to vary these different shifts and schedules, different teams. Do you all 
kind of come together for meetings to update each other on progress? 
 
JS: 
A lot of us, we never get to see each other all at once, where the other departments are 
mostly here during the day. But we'll have a meeting in the beginning of the shift with the 
supervisor, but now with the Covid, we started actually having meetings again where we can 
meet before with the Covid it was getting, everything was virtual for the management. As far 
as for the Covid, we would just call in, you know, call the boss's office from our cell because 
it was like we're not going to go congregate when we're all, especially last year. You know, 
last year was weird for everyone.  
 
VP: 
How did that change your work?  
 
JS: 
I would say just made it more difficult, putting this up in the hot summer. But I mean, 
I'm vaccinated now and everyone, they're trying to get everyone to get vaccinated.  
 
VP: 
I saw the competition between the plants.  
 
JS: 
Oh, yeah.  
 
VP: 
So, what would you say is the most challenging part of your job?  
 
JS: 
It's trying to manage, like, on a day like today, a lot of groups are working on things 
and are like, hey, I need this locked out. Hey, when is this going to shut down? So, I'm trying 
to get a hold of my central control operator and my supervisor to game plan when we're going 
to shut things down, when things need to be cooled down. Because unfortunately, today it's 
like I have, I try to keep my phone here. I have a trainee with me so, he can't do everything 
on his own. He can do some things. So, we have a lot of groups of different departments, a 
8 
 
lube department, our maintenance department, they're working a lot of stuff. Now that we're 
down, we have to scramble around to fix things that I was telling you about, things that we 
inspect and know that need to be fixed when we get a chance and now we have a chance. So, 
it's a little hectic out there, but we're used to it.  
 
VP: 
And so, how long does the training last for?  
 
[00:21:25] 
 
JS: 
It's a four year program. Now, he might be on the job after nine months, ten months, a 
year. But the training program is essentially a year to become, to do what I do. And then 
you're in training for three more years, where you finally get the full rate. And once you get 
the time and it gets reduced, somebody can say, well, he's, you know, he's full, he’s … and 
then you have to put four years in on the job before you can bid on another job because it 
takes so long to train and it's so extensive. And you don't want to have somebody say, OK, 
well, I want to go to this other department, you know what I mean? After you spent all that 
time training them and so there, we’re actually committed for four, four years of training, 
four years on the job.  
 
VP: 
Wow. So, are you involved in selecting the people who will get trained?  
 
JS: 
Yeah, we have a committee, it's called a progression committee. I’m a member of the 
electrical department, a member of management and two union guys will sit in a meeting and 
then afterwards we'll talk and we'll see who's the most qualified. There's a different criteria it 
sets, you know, where you're training, your knowledge, your skills, your education, how long 
you've worked here. Because we have a lot of guys in their 20s come in here and work now, a 
lot of young guys, like early 20s. 
 
VP: 
And they no longer serve as laborers, they go straight into the training? 
 
JS: 
Well, we've between retirement and people taking other jobs, we just lose so many 
bodies so fast that soon those guys are hired, there's jobs to bid on. The older guys just don't 
want them. So, the younger guys get to come right in and get off the labor gang and bid on 
the job, making probably ten dollars an hour more. And you get to learn a different skill. You 
know, some people work here for a while and then work somewhere else where they can 
apply that skill set and they, it's not for everyone.  
 
VP: 
So, what do you think are the necessary or the most important skills one needs to 
develop?  
 
[00:23:33] 
 
JS: 
Mechanical skills, process knowledge, in other words, knowing how things function, 
just generally knowing like a lube system or how water works in a bearing, water cool 
bearing. Or there's having good electrical skills and electrical knowledge is good. But we 
work on 480 volts here all the time. That's our main 4116 480. So, these lights here in these 
outlets, they're just 110, you know what I mean? Most of our work is in higher voltage, these 
bigger motors, you know, and there's a lot involved.  
 
9 
 
VP: 
Are they going to let you go walk around the plant, someone who can take you 
around?  
 
JS: 
Yeah. Yeah, I'm excited to see it.  
 
VP: 
So, what's your favorite part of the job?  
 
JS: 
My favorite part of the job is being able to, like, hop in the pickup truck, and I have 
my radio. And I'm on my own, just getting the stuff done, so it's nice to be able to not have to 
come into a job and stand at a conveyor and just put things on and off for eight hours, you 
know? There's a lot, you have to use your head here. You have to think, you have to be 
proactive. You know, we have a water cooling pond. If that thing gets low and the alarm 
doesn't work, you know, and I drive by, I've got to say, that's a little low. And go check our 
deep-water pump, which is 100 feet in the ground pooling cool water up. And all of a sudden, 
the deep water pump is spurting and, you know what I mean? You can't just drive by and put 
a blind eye on everything, you have to keep an eye on everything here.  
 
VP: 
It sounds like a very physical job.  
 
JS: 
It is. And then when you see something like a hole come somewhere and stuff's 
blowing out, we have we a responsibility to the environment and to the town. We have to 
shut it down and fix it. So, we have to keep an eye out for all that.  
 
VP: 
And so you said you have to wear all this gear. What do you typically put on?  
 
[00:25:34] 
 
JS: 
Well, we have a hard hat, safety glasses, you have your steel tip boots, fire resistant 
clothing. In other words, for an arc flash out of a motor control center, where I could be 
working, you have to have this on in case there was a fire. It wouldn't you know, it doesn't 
catch on fire. Obviously, long pants. You have your 3M, your N95 respirators for dust, 
goggles. If it gets a little crazy, you have any kind of glove you want to wear. And then we 
have like welding gloves for the pre-heater or when you go up there you'll feel the heat. Well 
actually no, you're going to luck out when you get down there, but it’s about 170 Fahrenheit 
on the one floor up there, just the ambient temperature. So, in July, it's not a place that you 
can work very long. You know, it's not like you can't, you can be there and you can do things, 
but you can't spend time working there. It's so hot.  
 
VP: 
So, do you put on different types of clothes for different parts of in the pre-heater or 
when it's hot?  
 
JS: 
We do have silver suits that you might see in movies or shows or documentaries. 
Firefighters will wear them in the middle of like a wildfire. It's a silver suit. It's a fire, fire 
resistant suit and gloves. And you even put stuff over your shins. And we have a hood that 
goes over a whole hood for when you work up there. It's you know, it's considered safety 
gear. But everywhere you go here, you've got to be aware of the potential injury. You know, 
just simply wearing a glove sometimes prevents you from getting your finger hit or bruised 
or. 
 
10 
 
VP:  
So, you’ve done multiple different types of jobs. What were some of the more 
challenging jobs, you know, you experienced?  
 
JS: 
I think the one I'm on now is the most challenging because you've just got to you've 
just got to take most of the responsibility of the process on your own, you know, and relay the 
information, that's my job. Everybody else does, you know, everyone's doing their own thing. 
So, it's it is, you got to really keep in touch with the boss so that the supervisor, because then 
he's explaining it to everyone else and all the other departments, what we got going on.  
 
VP: 
Do you get a break for lunch?  
 
JS: 
Well, we have the radio. So, if there's nothing pending and we have nothing like on 
our plate for that minute, yes, we can go eat. But unfortunately, like other departments who 
have their scheduled lunch, they, we, you know, we have to keep that radio on. And if you're 
in the middle of eating, you got to drop it and go. So, sometimes I eat lunch at three o'clock if 
I’m working six to six, you know what I mean? Sometimes, you don't eat lunch till three 
because the timing of everything and.  
 
VP: 
So, it’s very irregular. Do you eat by yourself or do you get to eat with a colleague?  
 
JS: 
We will, we'll eat together. We have breakfast on weekends if we can. We order 
breakfast and get it delivered. Yeah. So, it's nice to be here when no one's here. When there's 
not 50 people running around the plant and there's only four of us. Sometimes it's nice and 
peaceful.  
 
VP: 
So, do you become kind of friends with your coworkers?  
 
JS: 
Oh yeah, yeah. You develop friendships, a lot of friendships, a lot of people you're 
friends with, you work with because you're, it's such a unique industry, it's such a unique 
schedule that a lot of people just don't understand it because they know they work Monday 
through Friday, 7-3 or, you know, it's. That's, it is different, it's challenging. 
 
VP: 
And I guess you compare it to other kind of emergency workers? 
 
[00:29:19] 
 
JS: 
As far as the shifts, because, you know, I have friends that are firefighters now. They 
work 24 hours and have 48 off. And cops always have those weird schedules. So, you got to, 
there's always someone there, you know, and I'm sure the people who work at the power 
plants, they always have to have someone there and of course, the nuclear plants. So, other 
than that I don't think, and obviously your hospital workers, obviously, you know.  
 
VP: 
So, do you talk to your friends after work about cement as well? Does it sometimes … 
 
JS: 
Sometimes, sometimes we'll get involved with it, but sometimes you just want to 
leave it behind because it's like you spent a lot of hours here.  
 
VP: 
Do you disagree about the ways to maintain things or what's happening at the plant?  
 
11 
 
JS: 
We mostly talk about that when we're punching in and out. You know, people will 
kibitz at the time clock because when you come in, we all have our own radios. But back in 
the day we called it taking the radios. You come in, you get dressed, you take the radio. He's 
like, OK, here's what's going on. And he goes and gets a shower and goes home. And then 
you're here for your shift and then someone comes in to relieve you. So, we call it handing 
off the radio because you always have to have somebody here ready to go.  
 
VP: 
And so, do the workers still shower before heading out.  
 
JS: 
Oh, yeah. Yeah, we have showers here. We have lockers because you get filthy. Oh 
yeah. I shower here. So, you go home clean.  
 
VP: 
And so, yeah, you mentioned that there are new technologies improved the work?  
 
[00:30:58] 
 
JS: 
The technologies that improved it was everyone carrying their cellphones now, 
finally. You have a lot of guys are over 50 here. So, they're like dinosaurs. I'm almost 50, I'm 
49. But some of them really struggle with the cell phones. So, now but like now it's 2021, you 
know, we everyone's got a smartphone. So, you can take a picture, you can send a text, you 
can call. You know, some people are very hesitant about it because if you're salary, you have 
a work phone, but we don't. But for me, it's easier to contact the guy in Central right now, this 
radio, everyone has one on their hip. It's reverberating. It's not 100 percent perfect, but this I 
can get through it. My cell phone call them real quick, get to the bottom of something rather 
than communicate it over the radio. I think the radio is like going by the wayside. That's 
going to be, you know, everyone's going to have like a cell phone, a work cell phone. That 
would be easier. Now, you still need them for emergencies so somebody can call and say, 
hey, everyone, just letting you know this is what's going on, stay away from this area.  
 
VP: 
And so, you mention you take a picture …  
 
JS: 
Yeah. Instead of trying to describe it so we can write a work order up for another 
department to look at it. You just take a couple of pictures, send them to your supervisor, and 
then he can at least show the pictures to the other department supervisors. So, you can say, 
ah, OK, instead of trying to guess what's going on or write a diagram, you know, that's old 
school.  
 
VP: 
So, do you have, like, a group chat going?  
 
JS: 
With guys in my specific job, we do. We have a couple so that we can easily 
communicate what's going on. It's a way to document stuff without writing it down on a piece 
of paper.  
 
VP: 
Are you using text apps or a different kind of an app? 
 
JS: 
No, I just use text. Now, some people, the technology that's available now, obviously 
it'll evolve. But what's great about a cement plant is stuff they did in the 1950s, we still do it 
today. And they did it with two-way radios, there was no cell phones. It was barely hard 
lines, you know, and they were able to efficiently produce, you know, and get stuff done. So, 
a lot of the work is still it's you can have all the emails and paperwork you want and all the 
12 
 
meetings, but the only thing that really gets the cement plant going is men, knowledge, tools, 
hard work. It's just the way it is, it's the only way to run a cement, you can’t, if you have one 
hundred guys stand around with their hands in their pockets, plant doesn't run.  
 
VP: 
Do you think like workers, like work ethic has changed over time or do you feel like 
… 
 
JS: 
Um, yeah. I mean, I think that's general across the country, the world, the work ethic 
is going a little bit by the wayside. I mean, it's part technology, but part just this is the new 
world we live in.  
 
VP: 
Is it harder to train incoming workers? 
 
JS: 
Well, we've got a bunch of great young guys here, because if you come here, you 
already know what you’re coming into, usually nobody just applies and says, I don't know 
what it is, but I'm going to apply and it's usually I have a friend here or somebody works 
there. So, if the guys are coming here, a lot of them know what they're getting into. It pays a 
little bit more than just a job with the same amount of same skill set, but not in a cement 
plant. Cement plants pay a little bit more because you have to, it's just a little bit a little bit 
more intensive. 
 
VP: 
Do you get to observe other plants at all because you are working in an international 
company. Are there opportunities?  
 
JS: 
Oh, there are. There are opportunities here. And like I said, people who work here or 
people who've left here have gone to other cement plants, which are essentially the same 
thing. You know, obviously, obviously some things are different. But once you spent some 
time there, it's all the same. So, we have other ones right around us, right up the road here, 
Hercules and Keystone, Lafarge.  
 
VP: 
And so, do you ever sort of train people from overseas, workers coming from abroad 
or...?  
 
[00:35:16] 
 
JS: 
We used to, we used to. It used to be part of the program. Now, if Lehigh has some 
people in their engineering, it's like the engineers, they want to train the engineers. So, you 
get out of college, if you're an engineer, you come here and you start training and learning 
things, and then they have opportunities to travel to all different cement plants before they get 
a permanent position. Even they can even go internationally, they can go, you know, we have 
them in Asia and Europe, we have them, not sure Australia. I don't know. But Lehigh has a 
lot of locations throughout the world. So, there’s opportunities.   
 
VP: 
Have you ever considered going overseas to see cement plants?  
 
JS: 
No. No. Once I leave the cement plant, usually I don't want to come back till I have to 
come back for work because you just want to get away from it.  
 
VP: 
So, what do you do to relax from all the dust and … 
 
13 
 
JS: 
Bike riding, motorcycle riding, jet skiing on the river and beach, tennis, you know, 
bicycling. That’s what I enjoy.  
 
VP: 
Well, thank you so much. Is there is something that you would like to say or mention 
that didn't come up or that I missed in asking?  
 
[00:36:39] 
 
JS: 
No, if you don't have any other questions, it'll just be unique when you walk around, 
you'll see, you'll be like, wow, this is real dirty. But unfortunately, that's how cement plants 
are. We take rock and then we turn it into cement, powdered cement. And if you grind up that 
rock and look at it and look at powdered cement, maybe you per say you'd be like, what's the 
difference? But if somebody takes you around the process and shows you all the chemical, all 
the things that are added and all the things that we do with that to make it a final product, 
you'll be amazed at all the work that needs to be done to turn that dust into, you know, 
cement.  
 
VP: 
Do you go into stores and feel pride that this is the material you’re manufacturing? 
 
JS: 
Yeah, yeah.  
 
VP: 
Are you able to go around town and be like, this is, this is the my concrete?  
 
JS: 
Well, sometimes, yeah, we see local projects that they come here and get the cement. 
So, you get to see, some of the roads you're driving on, some of the bridges or what you work 
to make. I never think of it as that. I like that, though. But that is, it's a way to take pride in 
what you do.  
 
VP: 
Well, thank you so much.  
 
JS: 
You're welcome.
