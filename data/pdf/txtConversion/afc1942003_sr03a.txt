"Dear Mr. President", Bloomington, Indiana, January 8, 1942
AFS 6400A
Joe Badger: I am Joe Badger, a radio engineer employed in a radio manufacturing plant in Indiana.
Our particular plant has not as yet swung into any defense activity, but priorities and restrictions
of materials used in radio manufacture have made it more or less immediately imperative that we
assume some such vital productive effort. And so with this end in view our engineering department
is now conducting extensive developmental and experimental work on a variety of designs which are
certain to prove decisive in our national wartime program.
The morale of our workers is exceptionally high. The cooperative attitude which has always been our
company's policy is conspicuously noteworthy. And very soon now all our energy shall be directed
toward teaching the world that people who live in little bamboo houses shouldn't throw bombs
around.
