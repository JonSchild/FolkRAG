CF And most of the stuff, well they want to get their hair done the end of the week. So then
my weekend starts Saturday night and goes till Monday.
LH
CF Instead of Friday night till Sunday, it's Saturday night and then Sunday and Monday.
And Sunday there's usually not that much to do in the first place so you do it Monday.
Now this week I'm helping at Bible School Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. I said, "I can't
Thursday and Friday." So they hire me for Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday because
Thursday and Friday I just can't. I'm too busy back at the shop, but that keeps you
stepping. Between doing that and then I'm, I help with girl scouts <unintelligible text> that
go here too. Yeah I have, I'd be at Virginia right now, but I have plans to away in October
for 2 weeks. I'm taking my vacation then, so I said, "I'm not going to take off." They left
Friday and they went down to Chincateague. But Friday, Saturday, Sunday, they're coming
back today sometime or tonight. I don't know when they're even coming back. <But?> Oh
gees, so I said, "If it wouldn't be I'm taking vacation," I said, "I'd go, but," I said,"I'm already
taking vacation in October and this I planned since last August or what I want to do.

CF I used to work down in Reading before I had my shop, and there like su, over the
summer we started at 7. But normally our hours were 8-4, except oh I think it was June,
July, and August. I knew July and August for sure. Then we started 7-3, so we'd get out
a little earlier. And they used to think 7 was early. And I thought you know 7 for up here is
you know not that early. People around here get up you know. And I have a regular one
that comes at 6:00 every Saturday morning.
LH
CF No, but she's an ederly woman and she used to she gets up at 5:00. Regardless
whether she has to go to work or not, she always gets up at 5:00 in the morning.
LH
CF I'n not crazy about it, but I have no choice. I get up. I say, "It's only one morning out of
the week I get, I have to get up at 5:00 oclock. But then, well Saturday's or Fridays I start
at 7:30 in the morning and on a Thursday 8:00. And the rest of the week if I don't have to
I don't start before 9. If I don't have to. Sometimes, if I have no other choice I will. But now

CF uh, It's not even a half a mile, it's just right outside of town. It's close enough in the
winter when it snows I can walk. Because I'm deathly afraid to drive in snow. So if I don't

It used to be an old chicken house. And years ago before my time it was a cigar factory.

CF And then it was a house. That's what they tell me. This was before, The cigar factory,
then it was a house , then my grandfather bought the building and it's now a chick, it used
to be a chicken house, may be like ten years ago. Then for a long time it was empty, and
then when I started with the hairdressing thing, I wanted my own shop. But it was the state
laws that it had to be a certain amount you know a certain length and everything else. And
he said I can have one of these <unintelligible text> downstairs for a shop. So I grabbed it
at the chance. So we fixed it up. It's four years ago now that we fixed it up.
LH
CF Yeah, I work alone. It's big enough I could at least have onne- one other helper
besides, but then you run into so much hassle that way w too. And it's I think I'd just rather
do it, do what I can by myself. So, it gets a little rowdy back there sometimes. They kid the
hang out of me, but what the heck it's all in fun till it gets a little loud. I know somebody the
other week said they drove past and they blew as they drove past. Over the weekend they
saw me. They said,"Did you hear ? We blew." I said," When?" "Thursday morning." I said,
" I never even heard it." But I said,"There's dryers on and I said, "There were about three
women in there the shop at the time." And I said, " The three of <unintelligible text> those
are all talking at one time." I said,"No wonder I didn't hear you." It gets loud. But uh, that's
where I am from Tuesday to Saturday <unintelligible text> there.

supper. So there were plenty of other people to help clean up, so I said, " I'm gonna'", I
snuck in the other room. I got most of it done then I don't have to do it tonight. Cause I
knew I need it by Tuesday <unintelligible text> yesterday back at church. So I was doing
that. Now today and tomorrow I said I'll <unintelligible text>- teach those two days. And the

CF It's about a year now I been doing it. She gets around with a walker so she can she
had a stroke, I don't know how many years ago? So she gets around with a walker. So we
wash her hair at the kitchen sink and then I go up and set her then or a comb their out in
the afternoon.
LH
CF I don't think she gets out that much. I said that's one way she sees somebody every
two weeks besides the her relations and stuff. But she likes to know what I did you know
over the past 2 weeks from the time I had been up and stuff. She often asks,"Well, do
you have anything going thru the weekend?" You know, and she likes to hear the stuff I'm
doing. Probably gives her something to think of besides what she always thinks of.
LH
CF Yeah. Right up here across the street from where the doctor doctor lives. It'd be, you
probebly passed it comin' down 897. There's another one of those side streets that turns

<what?> she said, "Do you make house calls?" I said," ha." I thought well why not I never
tried it before. So I figured O.K. So I said,"Well I can." You know. So I went up. Then we
started. Every 2 weeks I go up now.
LH
CF She has her own rollers. So all I got to do is take the shampoo and the conditioner
along, and a coup, a couple combs and setting lotion. That's all. And then hair spray in
the afternoon when I go up. Tuesday I set everything out so I can just grab it. Cause
usually Wednesday morning I'm just in a rush, and then I just grab everything as I go. But
I don't mind doing it. It so, it sort of goofs you up sometimes, but I said well you can sort
of make up for it. I just have to allow time to go up there. And then when I get up there I
end up talking that I can usually figure I'm up there an hour. So I usually allow an hour time
becuase if not I a- just ain't gonna' make it back in time. Cause she sits and she talks, and
then I talk and then uhhh ... Then I don't get away, and I keep saying, "Well I got a go."
"Well why don't you sit down?"

afc1986022.afc1986022_ms5601
"No I'm not sitting down or I know I won't go." So I never sit down or I know I'll never get
off. But then in the afternoon she sits and watches her soap operas. So then usually
because I don't get a chance to in the day to see em, she fills me in what happened the
last 2 weeks. Because I always get up by 'bout 'bout 2:30 in the afternoon is usually a
good time before, like a lot of people around here work so from 3:30 on is when I watch
want have to to come call them if they want hair cuts and stuff. So then I got a sort of work
it like at 2:30 if the people that don't work, but a lot of people around here do work. So,
I sort of get up before the evening ones that start coming. Cause a lot most of my work
these evenings and Saturdays. Because of well, a lot of people work after 3:30. That's
when a lot come in.

CF Um hm. Somebody just asked me the other week how long it took me. I went 6 days
a week, so I could get done. And it took me, I just figured it out last weekend, it took me 8
month to finish it, to finish school. I graduated the beginning of June and about 2 weeks
after that I started beauty school.
LH
CF Well, the first 3 hun, by state law, now the first 300 hours a you can't work on people.
You gotta work on a dummy. OH.. It's a little head. <unintelligible text> It's about, it's about
the life, a life size head. And you give it hair cuts till you, and when you start, the ting is
fairly long. And till you get finished it's so short you can't hardly do anything with it. And
you set it, and you cut it.

CF It's human hair, but it's not like, it's in chunks on that head. It's not like hair. So, and it's
worse, working on a human head is good compared, if you can survive working on that
thing, than you'll survive working-on anything. So, I know we had started in the summer ,
and it was in the fall then before we Then what they do is like , well by state law it's 300,
but I know they didn't need us out on what they call the clinic floor. That's set up right like
a regular beauty shop would be. And you work on w people that come in, and they pay ,
<unintelligible text> but they only... Well I know when I wen t down it was, I think it was $
1.25, $ 1.50 to get your hair done. It's a lot cheaper thangoing in a shop. And people come
in you know and then, but I mean they take the risk you know, you don't know what you
might look like until we get done with you. YOu have teachers walking around, but oh. And
that's why after, in the fall of the year then, once I got out that I was working on the floor.
Then they said if you want to come in on Saturdays, you can. So to get more hours in. By
law you can
<unintelligible text> Pg.7 157
put 40 hours in a week, but we were only getting 4 or 5 days a week you only got 35 hours
in, 7 days a week, a 7 hours a day. So I used to go down Saturday mornings then and put
5 more hours in
LH
CF You have to by law, put in 1250, twelve hundred and fifty hours, They go by hours.
They don't go by ,you have a 3 year time span to get that in. You have to get a permit,
Library of Congress
Conversation with 23 year old female, Reinholds, Pennsylvania (Transcription) http://www.loc.gov/resource/
afc1986022.afc1986022_ms5601
a student permit first. And that's for 3 years. That's your going to school type thing you
know. Cause some want evenings, they worked during the day and then just go evenings
or go to school and evening. but that drags it out. It'd probably take you almost the three
years to get it done. Well, I didn'T have a job, and I just want to school, and then I started
in June. Probably about the middle of February I was finished. Because I wanted to get
finished to take my April State Boards. They only give boards 4 times a year.
LH
CF Two, I was up at Harrisburg for 2 days. There's what they call a practical part and a
written part. The practical is, I think it was about 9 or 10 operations that you have to go
through right like you would in a shop like hair cutting, perm wrapping, finger waving, pin
curls , I think it was scalp massage, and facials, which you don't even do. Not around here,
you don't do that stuff. Thank goodness. Manicures...
LH

part.
LH
CF You know you gotta find somebody whose willing to go along and go through I don't
know who was more nervous that day, me or her. I was a nervous wreck, but she was just
as nervous as I was, you know. Ohh my gosh! So to get, to take

my April Board, I had to be finished the 15th of March. You gotta be finished the 15th
of the month before. And I thought "home winters you have so much snow, and I won't
drive in snow." And I thought what am I going to do? " So I thought of getting 40 hours in
a week, and it worked it out to the middle of February. And we hardly had any snow that
winter. So, I was in luck. I only missed, I didn't miss any full day. Over the summer I had
to but they can Agnes, the flood was. And I missed, well we came home early early that

the guy ahead of us turned around. He said he's not going through. And I said to Susie,
"I don't care. I'm that close." And I said,"I have relation in Danville. The heck with it I said
"I'll stay with them if the car stops." And we got through. But, we almost lost our brakes too
coming home. Down in Danville they started that you could feel that they weren't holding.
We both got home. and then Fridays there was no way. I called her early in the morning,
the other girl that went along down. I said, we get a Reading paper and the one by-pass
we used to travel on had 4 feet of water on it So I called her up. I said,"Forget it. We're not
going anywhere this morning." Around here it wasn't that bad.
LH
CF Around here there wasn't. Ah, the following year would've been yeah the year I was
working down at Reading then, we had a terrific thunderstorm one Tuesday after yeah
Tuesday I didn't work, yeah it would've had to be Tuesday. Tuesday afternoons. We had
a terrific thunderstorm, and we had one hell of a flood here. You know, out here in the
meadow right down here, anything a chicken house went down through, and a couple
poles and a couple of trees. Farther there's a little bit of a creek down here. And a well,
that overflowed, and it just took

"It's too bad down that way to even go." And then we didn't have school yet Monday of that
the next week. They didn't have water on <unintelligible text> until Tuesday. They left us
come in Tuesday, but we weren't allowed to use any water.
LH
CF Well, we did a lot of our book work then. Cause we had that stuff so we did that. They
said maybe by dinner we'll have water. And then by I think around dinnertime they said
now we can start using water. So we didn't do that much from about 9 to about 12, but
books and that was about it.
LH
CF Yeah. You have to know for State Boards, and then for the written, well when you're,
even when you're working on the practical part. They come around and ask you questions
while you're working like well even, like they said on the scalp massage and stuff. It just

depends who your, what your inspector's like. He might say,"WEll a you know what bone
are you on now and stuff. So you had to know the bones and the muscles and the nerves

CF Well, I'd probably stand there and <unintelligible text>, "What the heck?" You know
good grief. But, it just a, we had to know it. And I think for the written part we had to know
it. The written part wasn't bad. That was true and false and multiple choice. It was a
hundred multiple choice, and 25 true and false. The true and
