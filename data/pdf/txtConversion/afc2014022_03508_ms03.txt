Was born into maple operation. Grandfather was still making the day to day 
decisions, then. Father went to Cushing Academy in Mass. for a year and 
returned after a year realizing that was where he was going to be for the 
rest of his life. His uncle Tom went into the Air Force and worked later in 
insurance,  Uncle Russell went to UVM in dairy science and went to work for 
Orange County Extension Service. Then landed in Ohio and then New Jersey. 
1967 was major change—went from horses to machines. [His grandfather 
had farmed with horses. Had a Ford tractor to mow the hay. Threw hay up 
into the wagon, the horses tow it up to the barn, pull a rope and drop the 
hay into the barn. “The horses left, the tractors arrived”[2:42].  His mother  
drove the tractor that did the baling—lasted one summer./ First hay baler 
in 1969. By 1972 regulations about exposing milk to the elements—had to 
have a pipeline, buckets not okay anymore. 52 cows year long. Put out 800 
buckets for maple and had a sugar house that blew over after hurricane of 
1938.

her arms and her leg. Problem with managing the evaporator , and she got 
hot sap sprayed on her.  That ended her boiling.  Father did cows milk, get 
the trees tapped and get the sap into the sugar house, but didn’t want to go 
into the sugar house. Jeff in 7th grade, not old enough to help very much. 
Parents hired a boiler for 7 seasons. Jeff left in 1976 to go to Lyndonville 
State College full time.  When he came back, no real place for him on the 
farm. Went to work for Pico (schoolwork had been for ski area 
management); summer of 1980, helped with crops, then ready to work in 
lift operation. Worked there for two seasons. When it didn’t snow, he 
returned to farm for sugar season. Stayed on at Pico for the first year; 
second summer, they put in Alpine Slide. Was on road duty and hurt his 
back; father got sick, so did full time on the farm. Brother Greg was at Vt 
Tech School, came home after he was done. At that point his father wanted 
to retire so Jeff and Greg started to run the farm.

 That lasted about a year. He took care of sugar; Greg didn’t want anything 
to do with it. Father was able to drive a little. Jeff had a girlfriend who 
helped him out with the buckets and on Easter his father didn’t want to 
work. So the two of them gathered the sap. The next day he boiled by 
himself (1982 or 3).   Married the girlfriend in 1984. Felt intimidated about 
boiling, mother got hurt, didn’t really know what the machinery did, didn’t 
have the modern equipment; one day he had the experience his mother did. 
Forgot about changing the gate and put the scoop through the front pan, so  
all the sap in the front pan went into the fire. “That ended the day.” [15:25]. 
Neighbor helped fix and old timers gave advice. Everyday is different. Had 
two options, get off the bus and go to the barn and milk cows or go to the 
sugar house.  Average day for the boilers then was 40 gallons. Now and 
average hour for him is 100 gallons. Continued in that sugar house .

by farming. Jeff making $100 a week, but had a house and many expenses 
provided.  His brother and his father hadn’t seen eye to eye on how the day 
to day operations should go with the milking, so brother decided to go into 
firewood. So milking fell to him and father who by then no longer able to 
milk.  His brother married and his wife hated the farm. Went to California to 
work as a trucker hauling ore out of river bed and using gravel for 
highways. Sells petroleum products. Draught area now. After he left he 
couldn’t gather the buckets and do all the milking by himself.  Then his 
father said he was going to start going to Florida in the winters. So decided 
to do tubing.  “Out went the buckets, in came the tubing.”[21:36]. Started in 
in 1984; by 1985 100% tubing.   Then his brother Russell was old enough to 
help. He got fire going in the sugar house while Jeff did chores. Lasted until 
he finished high school. Then he went off to Johnson & Wales. Never went 
into milk barn. Couldn’t do tractor driving—when father tried to teach him 
to drive, he lost it over the bank on a stone wall, the first one his Dad had 
ever purchased.

At Johnson and Wales got interested in food industry so went to Killington 
to work in various places until he decided that wasn’t his thing either. 
Bounced around a bit and then worked for Echo labs as a saleman and did 
that for 10 years and then decided he’s get certified as a home inspector—
not interested in the farm. So Jeff took it on by himself. And has fought tooth 
and nail to keep it. His first wife hated it. She told their children they 
wouldn’t be farmers. When kids arrived, everything fell apart and she 
thought it was too much work. Marriage lasted 20 years.  By the time the 
kids were out of the house, she said she was leaving. New wife totally 
supportive of the farm. Never bought new tubing during first marriage, wife 
so complaining about everything. Milk inspector said they needed so many 
upgrades, decided to give it up. On Jan. 1, 198 8 milk herd loaded up and 
auctioned off in New York. That was the end of dairying.

 He decided to amp up the maple and went logging. Wife didn’t like doing 
the books for logging. By the end of the first year, then developed hay 
business, which is quite strong. But labor intensive. Had two small children 
to watch while mother worked. Had to bail later. But it worked. Had to tell 
his father his couldn’t do the mowing anymore because he was so hard on 
mowers. Hardest thing he ever had to do. Had a new mower and father 
realized he couldn’t do it anymore—too many moving parts. But he helped 
with “tetting.” Kids then in school so easier.  By 1993 at 3200 taps on tubing, 
still on old evaporator. Hired a boiler but couldn’t keep up with the sap, he 
did 6pm  to 6am, and the boiler did 6am to 6pm. Figured he didn’t make 
money after paying him.       
Expanding maple 
34:31 – 40:40 
Decided to look for oil fired evaporator and went to Shrewsbury saying he 
wanted to build a sugar house. Asked what was wrong with old one, he said 
he had outgrown it. Asked what he meant—was having to dump sap 
because he couldn’t keep up with it. Couldn’t agree on where to put it. They 
cleaned everything out and pushed it over the bank. Mary came along in 
2004 and he started building again to 4500 taps. Before he had found a 
filter press, syrup pumps through; mother kept saying it would change the 
taste of the syrup. Had had a helper, Con, for 17 seasons on a filter press, but 
couldn’t expand.  With Mary the sky was the limit. Started expanding and 
got new tubing this time. Soon back to not being able to keep up with the 
sap. Needed RO (reverse osmosis machine to take the water out).  Mother 
always claimed it would change the flavor of the syrup.  Con guaranteed it 
wouldn’t change the taste. Lost him 5 years ago.

Didn’t know how to work the filter press when he and Mary tried to boil.  It 
was embarrassing. Got their first RO at $13,000. It would be paid off in one 
season using RO. Went from $18,000 to $5,000 in oil bill. Went from 3 
gallons of oil to 1 gallon of oil for to make a gallon of syrup. First machine,

concentrated to 8%. 4500 taps turned in 7200. Needed to concentrate it 
lower, to 10%.  Evaporator having problems. Sugar building up. Had to hose 
them out, didn’t know they had to be washed. Then went to 12%. Went to 
Leader to talk about evaporator. Basically they said you couldn’t do that 
lower than 8%. 
46:44 – 51:43 
Made some phone calls and found himself in Waterloo, Quebec designing his 
new evaporator. Hardest part was getting rid of old evaporator. Sold it for 
$6000. Had Gerry rigged so it didn’t come out easily.  He got some holes in 
the flue pan between Shrewsbury and Barre. Had problem Jeff had—then 
Leader listened. Now they say 20% concentrate when they told him highest 
was 8. He wants to make money now. Bought them out in 2008. Things 
turned around. Syrup was high $4 a pound, then dropped. He now has 5th 
RO machine. Oil dropped even lower.

Wanted some grants but needed engineer.  Didn’t get the grant. But 
engineer getting a lot of business.  Did tests on RO vs. Steam pan , convinced 
RO better but numbers proved wrong.  Electric bill less. Steam pan into flue 
pan.  A third gallon of oil to make gallon of syrup.  Electric running from 24 
to 7 hours.  Plus solar panels on back of sugar house and price of oil 
dropped, so that syrup is viable even when price drops.

Syrup is primary source of income. Has some beef cattle also. They sell by 
the pound out of the freezer. Major source is maple. Wholesale 50%. Some 
for retail. Through Highland Sugar Works. Does some business with 
Butternut Farm. Farmer’s market once a week. Good one in Ludlow. Less 
competition. Okemo Mountain School. 15% of business on website. Do 
hayrides, breakfasts, etc.  Noisy motor. Not Hollywood!  The fancier ones up 
north are showplaces. They hire a lot of people and boil at night. Jeff does 
everything himself, two senior citizens and a kid to help. Biggest pain is 
cleaning the evaporator and kid will do it.

mostly tapped; 65 acres and 135 acres spread out; rents 3 areas that are 
dense.  Good arrangements with neighbors.  Four land owners. Two of them 
are in their 90s. He gets first options to buy.  They’re land locked. No access 
to them. Has to sneak through some property to get there. Old road, no one 
has ever complained about his using it.

Probably at capacity after tubing area that have been logged, but mostly will 
just maintain. Would need to hire help to grow anymore. One employee for 
7500 taps; he was fine with 7500 alone; needed help with 10,000 taps.  
Maple Crest B&B is separate entity. Red Devon and Murray Gray cows and 
some crossed.  A few Herefords left. Built up a herd of 18 for 20 years, then 
when Mary arrived, 18 turned into 60. He wouldn’t have believed he’d sell 
steak 10 years ago. But 10 years ago there wasn’t pink slime. People just 
brought meat and didn’t care. His business started when people stopped 
trusting grocery stores. When he had old evaporator, there was a freezer in 
the corner, and every year he froze an animal and would sell a steak if 
someone wanted it. Feedback was that it was touch, but grass fed beef and 
must be cooked right (stay pink).

Involved with Rutland Area Farm and Food link and hooked up with NOFA; 
started growing organic beef, met Willie Gibson, tried to get him interested 
in beef—didn’t see the picture. He’s working it. Grass fed beef becoming big. 
Introduced to Red Devon. Came from Australia. Breed in 18 months. Cows 
grew with calves. Took Hereford at least 3 years to be ready for slaughter . 
By 18 months, 24 months, by 30 months you’re ready for them to go. Mixed 
Murray Grays are skittish.

Last year they processed and sold 24 animals; the year before, 24; this year 
5 so far. What’s grown for them has been that in the off season from 
farmer’s markets, people go there. Belong to Farm Fresh Connect, go online 
and order and delivered on a certain day. Mostly meats, some sausages, 
some syrup. Processed at Maple Ridge Meats in Benson. Greg Hathaway.

Greg asked how he chose his market. Rutland market always full; look for 
smaller competition. Ludlow market came to him and asked him to help 
develop it. He sent his daughter down there to sell and it was a disaster. 
Didn’t work. He had to turn into a salesman. Have to start chatting. Have to 
interact.  But can’t get too involved in conversation, then ignore other 
potential customers. Was talking to a guy who sells beef by the piece. 
Doesn’t price the meat until he sees them: Bostonians get $24a pound for 
sirloin steak; $5 for locals. Set a goal for yourself.  You’ll do it. Give hard 
candies to the kids. Samples of syrup, maple candies, stopped doing other 
samples. Market polices itself about safe presentation of food.

 Greg asked if he’s where he wants to be—is it working? Yes, bills are paid 
and he’s comfortable; not stuffing huge pay check in his pocket but talking  
about $30,000 fencing project. Describes himself as a planning guy with 
calculators everywhere,  punching out the numbers on the next project. 
Greg remarked it seemed as if for many years he chased the train that had 
already left the station. He agreed. Also worked as Janitor at the Shrewsbury 
elementary school for 21 years which ended when he was made very ill by 
chemicals in spray foaming the building. Walked into yellow fog. Now has 
chemical sensitivity syndrome. Set him back a couple of years.

Greg raised the question about the death of agriculture.  Agritourism was 
what his mother capitalized on in B & B in 1968.  Worried about water 
quality policies aimed farmers’ polluting the Lake.  Wonders if the State 
really wants farming with so many restrictions now.  Clark Hinsdale told he 
can’t spread manure on pasture land because a lot of houses. Can’t spread 
manure on meadows that are now houses. Also has to keep cows in 4 
different places. Manure has to go somewhere.  Doesn’t believe we’re losing 
forest land.  He’s tapping the trees that were once open farms. Dairy cows

 RAFFL wanted them to write a letter of support for USDA funding. Adding 
Addison County also.  They’re in a fog. Turnover is big. But they’ve helped 
them. Greg asked if he wanted to add anything.  His son is interested and 
works  in environmental division of  VELCO. Hope his son and grandson will 
be interested later. That would be the 8th and 9th generations.  Hopes 
something will continues.  It’s all about the market. Maple has become 
worldwide market. Talking about Russians tapping Birch but need a 
different evaporator. Runs all at once for 7 days and then done. It tastes a

But maple was surplus too in the 80s. But people like David Marvin and 
others started to develop a market for it. Made a great success of it.  Huge 
numbers of gallons of syrup within the mile radius where he is now. But if 
everyone in America bought 2.6 oz. of syrup would be a shortage.
