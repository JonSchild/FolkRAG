SEE- SAW, see- saw, now we're up or down. 
See- saw, see-saw, now we're oil to London town. 
See-saw, see- saw, boys and girls come out to play. 
See-saw, see-saw, on this our half holiday. 
Oh! what fun, boys, a 
race to run, boys, 
While each bright girl makes a 
hoop twirl, 
Fly the kite high in the clear sky, 
Light as hearts gay on this our holiday. 
Oh ! then shout with joy your heart's delight, 
Each boy and girl with : ill your might; 
For now from school to-day we're free. 
And we're as gay as gay can be. 
There's Polly and Johnny, and Kitty and Jane, 
All running to get on the see-saw again; 
But Dolly and Sally already are there, 
And swinging the see- saw high up in the air. 
Then come, boys, girls, and all join hands around, 
And merrily skip with delight o'er the ground, 
Such frolicksome games ne'er before have been seen, 
As we'll have to-day on the village green. 
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, what fun ! 
Ha, ha. ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. 
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, what fun! 
Ha, ha, ha, ha., ha., ha, ha., ha.

Hear our merry voices ring 
Through wood and meadow, as we sing. 
Life's bright sunshine o'er us beams— 
Our world is a

I'm going to wed a 
nice young lass, 
In beauty none can her surpass ; 
You may search the country all around, 
You'll not find one like Susan Brown. 
Oh, I 
love Sue, and Sue loves me, 
Were happier than king or queen can be, 
But Sue, you must know, has a 
curious way. 
For when I 
go to kiss her she will always say— 
cuom:s. 
Oh, dear me, let me be, get away, do, 
Oh, don't tickle me, now then. Ted, stop your chaff, 
He, he, lie, he, 
Oh, you make me laugh ! 
I 
never shall the day forget, 
The first time I 
and Susan met, 
She was milking on a 
three legg'd stool ; 
I 
call'd her duck, she called me fool ; 
She then gave me such a 
slap in the face, 
But I 
didn't mind that for I 
wanted to taste 
Her sweet pretty lips, like the roses so red, 
But when I 
went to kiss her, how she scream'd and said— 
Oh, dear me, etc. 
I 
said I'll have one kiss, and then 
-
.1.1v arm went round her waist again ; 
She shouted, " Oh ! I 
feel so queer," 
She scratched my face and pulled my ear; 
But I 
held fast and declared that I 
Would either have a 
kiss or die • 
She said, " Well, Ted, if you'll let me be. 
Just take one, duckie darling, but don't tickle me. 
Oh, dear me, etc. 
ENCORE VERSE. 
I'm married now and settled down, 
With my dear darling Stan Brown ; 
We are happy as a 
pair can be, 
And toss the babies on our knee; 
But when I 
chance to come home late at night, 
She's bound to catch me, and oh, what a 
plight, 
For Susan don't stop to consider my plea, 
But with a 
pair of fiat-irons she tickles me. 
Oh, dear me, etc.

GOLDEN rays of even sink upon the west, 
sousing long lost visions from their weary rest; 
Curfew bells are weaving magic far and nigh, 
Singing holy greetings from the days gone by, 
Singing holy greetings from the days gone by, 
EY'r:r gLief and sorrow thus must fade away, 
But affection's treasures will revive and stay; 
Golden rays of even sink into ray heart— 
What I

What I 
love and cherish ne'er from re shall part.

On, promise to meet me when twilight is falling 
Beside the bright waters that slumber so fair ; 
Each bird in the meadow your name will be calling, 
And ev'ry sweet rosebud will look for you there; 
It's morning and evening, for you I 
am sighing, 
The heart in my bosom is yours evermore ; 
I'll watch for you, darling, when daylight is dying, 
Sweet rose of Killarney, Mavourneen Astore. 
My heart is a 
nest that is robbed and forsaken, 
When gone from my sight is the girl that I 
love! 
One word from your lips can my gladness awaken— 
Your smile is the smile of the angels above ! 
Then meet me at twilight beside the bright waters, 
The love that I've told you, I'd whisper once more; 
011, sweetest and fairest of Erin's fair daughters— 
Dear rose of Killarney, Mavourneen Astore. 
TELL ME WHERE IS FANCY BRED. 
TELL me where is fancy bred, 
Or in the heart, or in the head 7 
How begot, how nourished 7 
It is engender'd in the eyes, 
With gazing fed; and fancy dies 
In the cradle where it lies : 
Let us all ring fancy's knell; 
I'll begin it,—Ding, dong, bell, 
Ding, don;, bell.

My Nellie, my own. 
Fairer seemed this world to me, 
Whilst the wind blew o'er the lea 
Words and kisses sweet for me,

My sad heart when won by you, 
Angel words said " thou art true,"

REMEMBER YOU HAVE CHILDREN OF YOUR 
OWN. 
Sung by GEORGE IluxTan, with immense applauste. 
IN 
your path through life each day you will meet upon 
the way 
Fellow-mortals upon whom this world cloth frown, 
Who, from poverty or crime, have fallen in their time, 
Or, by circumstances crushed and stricken down, 
Young men with blighted names, who once had noble 
aims; 
Young girls with shame and sorrow on their brow, 
Whom a 
kindly word might save from a 
dark, dishonored 
grave, 
While a 
cruel one would drive to madness now. 
They were once to some one dear, so don't pass them 
with a 
sneer, 
But speak a 
kindly word in cheering tone. 
You know not what's in store for the loved ones you 
adore; 
Remember you have children of your awn. 
The shop- girls on the street with as much respect should 
meet 
As the millionaire who in his carriage rolls, 
And the honest laboring man, with his strong and horny 
hand; 
They, too, have hearts and feelings—ye 
and souls. 
Their family is as dear to them as any hero. 
Though their clothes may be all ragged, torn, and old; 
(1) 
9 
REMEMBER YOU HAVE CHILDREN OF YOUR 
OWN.—Concluded. 
Dejected and forlorn, yet still their hearts are warm, 
Though they lack the rich man's cheerful home and 
gold. 
They are all to some one dear, so don't pass them with a 
jeer, 
But speak a 
gentle word with soothing tone. 
You know not what's in store for those whom you 
adore; 
Remember you have children of your own. 
Don't despise the wretched poor whom perhaps grim want 
may lure 
To steal the bread their starving children crave. 
Be not the one to blame—you, yourself, would do the 
same. 
With starvation at your door you'd dare the grave; 
And the wretched drunkard, too, who perhaps was once, 
like you, 
Respected and beloved by one and all, 
Who, no doubt, through care and strife, or some sorrow of 
their life, 
Have fallen, but not quite beyond recall; 
And the poor outcasts forlorn, don't pass them by with 
scorn, 
But speak unto them in a 
gentle tone. 
Perhaps they're not to blame for their lives of sin and 
shame; 
Remember you have children of your own.

Price 50 cents. 
UNDER the snow, the cold white snow, 
My darling she's sleeping to- night, 
A 
chaplet of flow'rs encircles her brow, 
Her brow now so spotless and white ; 
They laid her away in the cold, dark grave, 
Where the moonbeam's silv'ry light 
Shines down on her home where the willows waYe 
Above my darling to- night. 
Sleeping to- night, sleeping to- night, sleeping, 
Sleeping, sleeping to- night, 
Sleeping, sleeping ' neath the cold white snow, sleeping 
I'm sitting to-night in her lonely room, 
The midnight hour draws near ; 
Methinks I 
hear thro' the silent gloom, 
My loved one's step on the stair ; 
Ali, no ! 'twas the sound of the wind harp that sigh'd 
Thr011al) the ivy that climbs round the door ; 
For my darling's at rest, she's an angel now, 
And her step 1'11 hear no more. 
Steeping to- night, etc. 
Spring, with its fragrant vales and flowers, 
Will soon be here again ; 
In wooded dell, and vine-clad bowers, 
PH seek for my darling, in vain ; 
When sunbeams shall fall on her lowly bed, 
I'll strew there sweet emblems of love. 
And where snows never come, and flowers ne'er fade, 
I 
will find my lost darling above. 
Sleeping to- night, etc.

OH 
! 
sing to me one song of thine, 
One song before we part ; 
The voice that angels stoop to hear, 
Must soothe my aching heart, 
Oh ! let it be a 
gentle song, 
Replete with love innate ; 
Such as the golden robin sings, 
To win an early mate. 
(Repeat two last linet.) 
'Tis true, when lovers meet to part, 
When breasts with sorrow swell, 
Sweet music lends her cheery voice, 
And helps to say " farewell !" 
We've met our last, perhaps for years, 
To-night,we bid adieu ! 
Our fondest hopes of timely bliss 
Have vanished like the dew. 
(Repeat two last Unes.) 
Then sing to me a 
song of joy, 
One song before we part ; 
That I 
may bear away with me 
Thy music in my heart. 
I'll kiss thee as thou warblest on, 
A 
token of our love ; 
And leave thee, till we meet again, 
In care of Heaven above. 
(Repeat two last lines.)

I  
e-
sweeter far than moon or star, Whilst court-ing in the rair. 
The rain poured down alarmingly, 
When to a 
tree we came, 
And shelter took beneath it, 
There I 
quickly learned her name. 
She also told me where she lived, 
With pa down at the farm; 
A 
farmer's daughter I 
well, said I, 
That is an extra charm. 
Spoken.—I 
glory in country life, and a 
farmer's daughter, what could Ir. 
barter; I 
wieled the rain would keep on as I 
rather liked— 
Courting in the rain, &e. 
At length the rain abated, 
And the sun shone out quite bright, 
And the little birds began to sing, 
My heart it felt so light. 
I 
gently press'd her arm in mine, 
And said now don't say " nay," 
But let me come and meet you here 
.Again some other day. 
Spoken. —Well, she said. I 
can't exactly decide, you trust ask my ptt.

Courting in the rain,

We reaclid the old farm-house, and then 
She introduced to me 
Her pa, a 
jolly niee old boy, 
With him I 
made quite free. 
I 
told him when and where I'd met 
His daughter in the rain, 
And bless'd the lucky chance that took

I TICKLED HER UNDER THE CHIN. 
Music published by G. 
P. 
BENJAMIN, 712 Eighth Avenue, can be 
obtained from any music dealer. (Copyright 1876, by W. R. DENnorr.) 
Written and composed by HertnY M ONTAGUE, and sung by him with 
overwhelming applause at Tony Pastor's Theatre, New York. 
I 
met a 
fair charmer a 
few weeks ago, 
In a 
Madison Avenue stage, 
Her style and her figure it pleased me, you know, 
She was just about the right age. 
As we were alone, I 
suggested to her 
In terms quite polite and refined, 
That I'd be most happy to see her safe home, 
She said yes, if you'll be so kind. 
SPOZEN.—SO 
I 
took the young lady to her home, she invited 
me in, and I 
spent a 
very pleasant evening, and just before I 
left 
CHORUS. 
I 
tickled her under the chin, 
Repeat— I 
tickled again and again, 
She did not say no, she liked it, you know, 
When I 
tickled her under the chin. 
I 
called by appointment to see her next day, 
And asked her if she'd take a 
drive, 
She Said I'm delighted, that's just what I 
want, 
And in a 
moment was close by my side. 
Now driving, you know, makes your appetite keen, 
So when we got back, to Dehnonico's we went, 
And I 
ordered same oysters and wine. 
POKEN.—Yes, we had a 
delightful supper together, and after 
oper, when the wine commenced to make her cheeks rosy, I 
reached across the table, and I 
I 
tictkled her Eider the chin, etc. 
I TICKLED HER UNDER THE CHIN— Continues! 
Now I 
see her quite often, and you won't be surprised 
That our friendship ripened so fast, 
For I 
found that in her, I 
really had met 
A 
dear, darling creature at last. 
And our love grows stronger, day after day, 
Were going to be married next June, 
And it all came, through that queer little way, 
That I 
tickled her under the chin. 
SeoKEK.—So last night when she bid me good- by at the front 
door, she said Charley, you dear good fellow, I'll never forget 
the first time that you— 
Tickled me under the chin, 
That you tickled me under the chin, 
I 
didn't say no, for I 
liked it you know, 
When you tickled me under the chin, 
When I 
tickle her under the chin, 
I 
tickled again and again, 
She did not say no, for she liked it, you know, 
When I 
tickled her under the chin. 
SPOKEN.—This is the moral of the story: 
You all have a 
chance for adventures like this, 
With the charming young ladies you meet, 
And you'll find on an average that five out of ten 
Won't object to a 
drive and a 
treat; 
But pray let me give you one piece of advice, 
When a 
girl's loving kiss you would win, 
Just do it quite gently, and don't be too rough, 
When you tickle her under the chin. 
CHORUS. 
When you tickle her under the chin, 
Rweat—When you tickle her under the chin. 
Just do it quite gently, and don't be too rough, 
When you tickle her under the chin,

THE OLD WOODEN ROCKER. 
Words and music by FLORENCE HARPER. 
Ilas Music of this song is published by SPEAR and DEHITROTP, 
717 Broadway, New York, 
Price 40 cents. 
THERE it stands in the corner, with its back to the wall, 
The old wooden rocker so stately and tall ! 
With naught to disturb it but the duster or broom, 
For no one now uses that back parlor room. 
Oh ! how well I 
remember in days long gone by, 
When we stood by that rocker, my sister and I, 
And we listen'd to the stories that our grandma would tall, 
By that old wooden rocker we all lov'd so well. 
CHORUS. 
As she sat by the fire she would rock, rock, rock, 
And we heard but the tick of the old brass clock; 
Eighty years had she sat in that chair grim and tall, 
In that old wooden rocker that stands by the wall, 
If this chair could but Fpeak, oh ! the tales it could tell,— 
How poor aged grandpa in fierce battle fell : 
'Neath the stars and the stripes he fought bravely and true, 
He cherish'd his freedom, the red, white, and blue I 
It could tell of bright days and of dark ones beside, 
Of the day when dear grandma stood forth as a 
bride; 
This is why we all love it, this old chair grim and tall, 
The old wooden rocher that stands by the wall. 
As she sat by the fire, etc. 
But poor grandma is gene, and her stories are done,— 
Her children have follow'd her, yes, one by one, 
They have all gone to meet her in the " sweet by-and-by,h 
And all that is left is dear sister and I. 
Never more will we hide her gold specs, or her cap; 
Never more will we teaze her while taking her nap; 
Never more will she slumber in that chair grim and tall, 
Aae old wooden rocker that stands by the walL - 
As she sat by the fire, etc

BE HOME EARLY TO-NIGHT, 
MY DEAR BOY. 
Written and sung by JOHN W. GIBBONS. 
I 
HAVE travelled through life, I 
have seen many things 
That surprised me in every town. 
I 
have been at the plow, I 
have been at the spade, 
Till dark, from sunrise in the morn, 
But at night I 
would go for some pleasure through town; 
I 
was always for pleasure and joy, 
My mother would say, when going away, 
Be home early to- night, my dear boy. 
CHORUS. 
Be home early to-night, my dear boy, 
Be home early to- night, my dear boy; 
Don't spend your money to gamble and drink. 
Be home early to- night, my dear boy. 
One night I 
left home, and poor mother was sick, 
In fever of torture and pain; 
She says, " My dear boy, take the motto I 
give, 
I 
may not give it to you again." 
But when I 
returned from that night's fun and joy, 
I 
heard my poor mother was dead. 
'Twos then a 
cold chill through my body did run, 
When I 
thought of the last words she said— 
Bo home early to- night, etc. 
All young men that are here, take a 
word of advice: 
To your father and mother attend; 
For a 
good mother's love it must not be : 
When she's 
one you've lost your best friend. 
Don't spend all your money to gamble and drink, 
There are many things you can enjoy. 
Take the lesson I 
give—'twas a 
mother's request. 
Keep good hours at night, my dear boys. 
Be home early to- night, etc.

IT'S TITNITYWU1N YOV PEEL TELAT WAY. 
As sung Ivy Gus Virtizsaste 
I 
DTIAN 'T forget how queer I 
felt when first I 
fell in love, 
I 
had a 
most severe attack through squeezing a 
lady's glove. 
her lovely band was in it as I 
danced with her so gay, 
thought myself in paradise—it's funny when you feel that 
way. 
CDOICUS, 
felt as tho' Fd tumbled into honey, and some one had left me 
all their money. 
The feeling's so peculiar and funny, it's funny when you feel 
that way. 
I 
took her down to supper,'and sat down by her side, 
I 
helped her to the ices, and filled her glass with pride, 
In fact paid such attention, that she viewed me with dismay, 
I 
moved my chair so close to hers, it's funny when you feel that 
way. 
I 
felt as tho', etc. 
We met again nne afternoon, and as we were alone, 
I 
plucked up nerve to ask her if some day she'd be my own; 
She blushed and said, go see papa and ask him if I 
may, 
I 
danced the cancan round the room, it's funny when you feel 
that way. 
I 
felt as tho', etc. 
The old man said that we might wed and so he crowned on' 
bliss, 
And I 
shall be a 
married man in about a 
mouth from this. 
it seems as though the time, somehow, would never pass away, 
I 
long to hear those wedding bells, it's funny when you feel 
that way.

"TARE IT BOB." 
Written and Composed by A RTHUR LLOYD., 
I'm a 
jolly old in ller, Bob D-11 is my name, 
And in my own village I'm well known to fame, 
I've a 
wife and a 
daughter, ft dear little lass. 
I'm fond of them both, and I'm fond of a 
glass. 
Some say, I'm too fond, well, perhaps that may be, 
I 
try to be steady, and am, as you see, 
But if I 
attempt to refuse drink a-day, 
I 
fancy the wheel of the mill seems to say— 
onus. 
Take it Bob, take it Bob, take it Bob, take it Bob, 
That's what I 
fancy the mill says to me; 
Take it Bob, take it Bob, take it Bob, take it Bob, 
Take it Bob, take it Bob, it's better than tea. 
I've tried very oft a 
tee-tot'ler to be, 
But my mill is quite right, brandy's better than tea, 
And altho' what I 
say, you may all think absurd, 
I 
believe what the mill says is right, 'pon my word. 
I 
called on old Jones ' bout some business, you know, 
And ho said, Bob, a 
pipe and a 
glass, ' fore ye go, 
Now I 
didn't require it, believe what I 
say, 
But altho' a 
mile off, I 
could hear the mill say 
Take it Bob, &e..-
Now I 
dreamt Vother night that Bob Bell was no more, 
That he'd died at the age of p•rhaps forty or more, 
And I 
beard people round me say, drink's done iss worst, 
But altho' I 
was dead, I 
was dying with thirst. 
A bottle of brandy close by I 
could see, 
It was meant for the mourners, it wasn't for me, 
But as on my bed, still and silent I 
lay, 
In the distance distinctly I 
heard the mill say— 
Take it Bob, dec. 
I'm only up here for a 
bit of a 
spree, 
My wife thinks it's business between you and me, 
And you know the old saying, that never deceives, 
What the heart doesn't see why the eye deesn't grieve, 
I 
must toddle at once, so good bye to ye all, 
Next season I 
hope I 
shall give ye a 
call, 
Don't ask me to drink when Pm going away, 
Or I'm certain to fancy I 
hear hear the mill say— 
Take it Bob. &a.

THE BONNIE SOLDIER LADDIE. 
Written by Mr. GEORGE W ARE. 
Sung by Miss RITZY BROOKE. 
My love he is a 
soldier in lands far away, 
A 
light-hearted laddie, so cheerful and gay, 
And when he returns he's going to be wed, 
So I 
love my soldier laddie with his jacket so red ; 
He has fine rosy cheeks, he's a 
brave, handsome lad 
The pride of his mother, the joy of his dad, 
For his ways are so winning, and I'll wait awhile 
For my soldier laddie of the rank and file. 
CHORUS . 
Then with colors flying and banners so gay, 
Along with my laddie I 
will march away, 
For his ways are so winning, and I'll wait awhile 
For my soldier laddie of the rank and file. 
'Tis a 
year since he left and bid me adieu ; 
He will not deceive me—he loves me too true, 
And I 
love the laddie, and I'm longing to see 
My soldier returning—then he'll marry me; 
But a 
day seems a 
month, and a 
month seems a 
year, 
When longing for your true lover's voice to hear, 
But his ways are so winning, and he'll soon be back, 
A.nd have lots of treasures for me in his knapsack. 
Then with, etc,. 
Ile sent me a 
letter, each word breathing love, 
Comparing my eyes to the bright stars above ; 
He speaks of promotion, but he'll wait awhile 
Ere he's made a 
general from the rank and file; 
ant, whether a 
private or a 
N. C. B., 
I 
don't care a 
fig if he still loves me, 
For his ways are so winning, and he'll soon he home, 
Then all o'er the world with my laddie I'll roam 
Then with, etc. 
; 
GAL BY THE NAME OF MeGEE. 
I'll sing of a 
damsel so lovely and fair, 
With her in beauty no gal could compare; 
Such lovely eyes and sweet curly hair, 
Had this gal by the name of McGee. 
Her pa and her ma were both mighty rich, 
They lived up on avenue V. 
The sports round the city were all deep in love, 
With this gal by the name of McGee. 
CHORUS. 
She cared not for them, but in spite of their moans, 
She cast them aside for a 
fellow named ;Jones ; 
He sat on the end and he'd rattle the bones, 
In a 
nigger band down on Broadway. 
To see him perform every night she would go, 
The seat she would take was in the front row, 
Sweet scented bouquets to him she would throw 
To let her lover know she was there. 
In raptnre she smiled on his comical songs, 
0! my, what a 
sight it was to see ; 
And loud she laughed at his stale, played ont,jokes, 
Would this gal by the name of McGee. 
She cared not for them, & c. 
To see her papa and get his consent. 
The pair of them to her house straightway went; 
To marry her love she fully was bent, 
No matter what others might say. 
The old man he kicked up a 
horrible row, 
It was something that he could not see; 
He ran Mit. JONES for his life from the house, 
And locked up poor Susie McGee, 
he cared not for then), & c. 
To all her entreati s 
the old man was deaf, 
So Susie, quite stricken w 
ith sorrow and grief, 
Resolved that in death she'd soon find relief', 
And end all her woes here on earth. 
That nightafter writing a 
letter quite long, 
To the loved one she'd never more see ; 
She swallowed her waterfall, hair pins and all, 
And that is what became of McGee. 
She cared not for them, & e.

REMEMBRANCE 
EIOME: OR HOME ONOZ 
MORE. 
Written, Composed and Sung by Gus W ILLIANts. 
I 
am thinking of my home, 
Of the cottage on the hill; 
The cottage where my poor old mother died : 
Of the orchard, of the school where I 
learned the golden 
rule 
Of old " Dobbin" on whose back I 
oft did ride: 
And as I 
recall the scene, 
It seems just like a 
dream ; 
A dream that is past now, and is o'er: 
A tear comesin my eye, and I 
can only sigh, 
For to see my dear and good old home once mtbre. 
CHORUS. 
Home once more, home once more, 
Shall I 
ever see my home once more ? 
Home once more, Home once more, 
Shall I 
ever see my home once more ? 
Shall I 
aver see the church where I 
often used to go? 
Shall I 
ever see that dear old church again ? 
Shall I 
ever see the mill that stood right near the hill. 
Or must I 
in a 
foreign land remain ? 
Shall I 
ever see my father? 
That dear old grey haired man, 
As he sat in the arm-chair by the door 
have power, I 
have wealth, 
Yet I'd give them all for health, 
So that I 
could see my dear old home once more. 
Home once more, &o.

W E 
kiss'd each other, Tom and I, 
Beneath the linden tree, 
And now and then he breathed a 
sigh 
That told his love for me ; 
He held me to his loving breast 
And whispered words of cheer, 
My hand in his was softly pressed, 
And I 
had naught to fear. 
CHORUS. 
We kissed each other, Tom and I, 
Beneath the linden tree, 
And now and then he breathed a 
sig... 
That told his love for me. 
The birds were singing songs of joy 
Among the linden boughs, 
But they did not the least annoy 
My darling's golden vows ; 
Within his eyes of gentle blue 
I 
saw the honest heart— 
His promise that he would be true, 
And never from me part. 
We kissed each other, ets 
The kisses that he gave to me 
Beneath the linden leaves 
Have lingered since he went to sea, 
And oft a 
vision weaves; 
In dreams I 
feel his lips again, 
And see his form of grace, 
But nothing will relieve my pain 
Until I 
see his face. 
We kissed each other, etc.

THE MERRIEST GIRL THAT'S 017T, 
With laughter and good- humor, why, 
I 
pass my time away, 
So, while Fin here 1'11 do my best 
To please you with my lay. 
Then, come along and join my song, 
And raise a 
merry shout, 
To welcome me : for, I'm you see, 
The merriest girl that's out. 
CHORUS. 
Now then, young men, 
Don't be melancholy: 
Just see, like me, 
If you can't be jolly. 
If any thing goes wrong with re.e, 
I 
never sulk or pout: 
In fact, I 
am, and always was, 
The merriest girl that's out-
The gentlemen complain and say; 
I'm such a 
dreadful flirt: 
But if they will make love to me, 
Their hearts I'm sure to hurt— 
I 
really can't help laughing, 
When I 
hear them sigh about; 
For sentiment it don't suit me ; 
I'm the merriest girl that's out. 
Now then, ko, 
The notes and presents I 
receive, 
Would fill a 
basket quite, 
While bouquets rare, I 
do declare, 
Are sent me every night. 
The notes all speak of broken hearts 
Some mean it, I've no doubt; 
I'M sorry: yet I 
still remain 
The merriest girl that's out, 
Now, then, 
To balls and parties T 
oft go: 
For, dancing I 
admire, 
And waltzing is a 
thing, I 
own, 
Of which I 
never tire; 
And should my partner squeeze my hand, 
I 
know what I'm about: 
;t yleases him, and don't hurt me 7 
L'm the merriest girl that's out.

TING, TING, THAT'S HOW THE BELL GOES. 
Music arranged by PAUL RITTER. 
The words and music of this song will be sent, post paid, by HARDING, 
No. 229 Bowery, New York. 
Now I'm deep in love, as I've often been before, 
No girl's such a 
pearl as the girl I 
adore, 
And she is a 
waitress at our luncheon bar. 
Which as a 
French Cafe is known better far; 
She waits on the swells who come in there to dine, 
And flirts with the ladies while drinking their wine. 
There are bells on the table the swells have to ring, 
And Geraldine waits on the ting, ting, ting. 
CHORUS . 
ling, that's how the bell goes 
ting, pretty youno• thing, 
You'l! be my wife, I'll buy the ring, 
Servants to wait on our ting, ting, Una% 
One day there, while dining off chicken and ham, 
I 
call'd her my darling, my own little lamb, 
And ask'd her if she'd have me, and that sort of thing. 
I 
very soon bought her a 
little gold ring. 
Three weeks after that, well, I 
made her my wife, 
Then said I'd no money, no income for life. 
Then the fair little, rare little, sweet little thing 
Said she'd go back and wait on ting, ting, ting. 
Ting, ting, 
The day we got wed, ' twos the greatest of bliss, 
When we came from the church, I

no ! it can't be that they've drivou 
Their father, so helpless and old, 
(Oh, God, may their crime he forgiven,) 
To perish out here in the cold. 
Oh, Heavens ; I

See the tears how they course down my cl;eitite 
Oh, this world it is lonely and dreary, 
And my heat" for relief vainly seeks. 
CH OR US . 
For I'm old, and I'm helpless and feeble, 
The days of my youth have gone by; 
Then over the hill to the poor house 
I 
wander alone there to dio, 
me! on that old door-step yonder, 
I've sat with my babdo on my knee; 
No father was happier or fonder 
Than I 
of my little ones three. 
The boys, both so rosy and chubby, 
And Lilly with prattle so sweet! 
Sod knows how their father has loved them__ 
But they've driven him out in the street.

OVER THE HILL TO TH:19 POOR HOUSE.— 
Concluded. 
It's long years since my Mary, was taken, 
My faithful affectionate wife ; 
Since then I'm forlorn and forsaken, 
And the light has died out of my life. 
The boys grew to manhood; I 
gave them 
A 
deed for the farm! ay, and more, 
I 
gave them this house they were born in! 
And now I'm turned out from its door. 
For I'm old, etc. 
Oh, children! loved children! vet hear we, 
I 
have journeyed along on life's stage ; 
With the hope that you all would be near me, 
To comfort and cheer my old age 
My life-blood I'd gladly have given, 
To shield and protect you! but hark! 
Though my heart breaks, I'll say it's you've driven 
Me out here to die in the dark. 
For I'm old. eta. 
But, perhaps, they'll live happier without me; 
Farewell, dear old home, ah! farewell! 
Each pathway and tree here about me, 
Some memory precious can tell. 
Well, the flowers will bloom bright as ever, 
And the birds sing as sweet to the morn 
Then over the hill from the poor house, 
Next Spring the old man shall be borne. 
For I'm old, etc.

PARODY ON 
STICK TO YOUR MOTHER, TOM. 
Words by W ILLIE W ILDWAVE, 
On. \ yell do I 
remember the night that. I 
was born, 
I 
danced upon my sister's neck and pared my papa's corn; 
My breath was sweet with onions, nothing marred my joy, 
was my mamma's darling, my papa's fair-haired boy. 
My pupa was a 
whaler—a 
schoolmaster, you must know, 
Who used me as a 
hat- rack whene'er he ,e•ot a 
show. 
A bank cashier he left us and went to Can-a-da, 
And as he skipped the town one night, these words to me did 
say : 
CHORES. 
Stick to your mother. Toni, while she has wealth, 
Never do a 
stroke of woik, ' tis bad for the health ; 
Be a 
corner statue, Tom, loaf around all day, 
Oh, hit her with an axe when her hair turns gray. 
Last night I 
dined with Jay Gould, and there met Vanderbilt, 
I 
asked In in for a 
million dollars, and came near being killed; 
John L. and I 
put OH the gloves, but I 
knocked him out o 
sight, 
Then ldew up Blooming Hingland with a 
charge of dynamite. 
I 
mesmerized my inother-in-law so charming and so neat, 
She presented me with a 
house and lot at thirty New York- St. 
The wind blew thro' my vitskers and trilled this merry tune, 
It's very cold in winter, and the walking's good in June. 
SPOT:EX.—Al), yes, I 
can never forget the old gentleman's 
admonition, as he elevated his pedal extremities and perogrin-
tiled across the cold and frosty thoroughfare, in a 
murmur that 
sounded like an angel's whisper: 
CHORUS. 
Stick to your mother, Toni, while you have luck, 
She is the 2illv. boy, you can easily pluck; 
Never soil your hands with work when I 
am far away, 
Oh, fan her with a 
bale- stick when hair turns gray. 
AIN'T YOU GOT A CHEEK. 
By ROBERT MeKAY. 
Sung by Toxr PASTOR. 
OH, I 
love a 
maiden, she's fair as can be. 
Her hair is nut brown and her boot No. 3, 
Her cheeks are as red as the blossoming rose, 
Joy follows her footsteps wherever she goes, 
In her is all happiness earth can bestow. 
I 
can't understand why she teases me so, 
For when I 
would kiss her, this sly little puss, 
On her lips puts her finger and answers me thus— 
CIIORUS. 
• 
3F 
Oh, ain't you naughty, to talk to me so, 
No, I 
won't let you, now please let me go, 
I'll be " mad " and to you I'll never speak, 
You're " horrid," you're " awful," ain't you got a 
cheek ! 
It's awful, when for a 
caress you're inclined, 
A 
maiden should act so unjust and unkind, 
This motive alone she can have I 
am sure, 
The power received will be valued the more, 
And thus they're so artful and cunning the elves, 
When we know they would " like to" as well as our-
selves, 
And so I'm perplexed and the point I 
can't see, 
When covered with blushes she cries out to me— 
Oh, ain't you naughty, etc. 
Some day we'll be married, oh, thrice happy day, 
Then all affectation will be cast away, 
Then I 
shall enfold her in these loving arms, 
And shield her forever from earth's wild alarms. 
Joy, joy then shall reign in this bosom supreme, 
Life then will be real, not a 
delusive dream, 
I'll kisS.her, caress her, do just as I 
please, 
And will not be amazed by such words as these— 
Oh, ain't you naughty, eta.

BABY bye, here's a 
fly ! 
Let us watch him, you and L 
How he crawls 
Up the walls, 
Yet he never falls. 
believe with six such legs, 
You and I 
could walk on eggs. 
There he goes, 
On his toes, 
Tickling baby's nose. 
Spots of red dot his head ; 
Rainbows on his back are spread. 
That small speck 
Is his neck, 
See him nod and beck. 
I 
can show you, if you choose, 
Where to look to find his shoes; 
Three small pairs 
Made of hairs, 
These he always wears. 
Black and brown is his gown, 
He can wear it upside down. 
It is laced 
Round his waist ; 
I 
admire his taste. 
Yet though tight his clothes are made, 
He will lose them, I'm afraid, 
If to-night 
He gets sight ' 
Of the candle-light. 
In the sun webs are spun, 
What if he gets into one ? 
When it rains 
He complains 
On the window-panes. 
Tongue to talk have you and L 
God has given the little fly 
No such things. 
So he sings 
With his buzzing wings.

"BABY BYE."— Concluded. 
He can eat bread and meat, 
There's his mouth between his feet ; 
On his back 
Is a 
pack 
Like a 
peddler's sack. 
Does the, baby understand ? 
Then, the fly shall kiss her hand ; 
Put a 
crumb 
On her thumb, 
Tifayb‘,,, 
he will come. 
Catch him ! 
No, let him go, 
Never hurt an insect so ; 
But, no doubt 
He flies out 
Just to gad about. 
Now you see his wings of silk. 
Drabbled in the baby's milk. 
Fie, 0 
fie, 
Foolish fly ! 
How will he get dry ? 
All wet flies twist their thighs, 
Then they wipe their heads and eye!,; 
Cats, you know, 
Wash just so, 
Then their whiskers grow. 
Flies have hairs too short to comb, 
So they fly bareheaded home ; 
But the gnat 
Wears a 
hat, 
Do you believe that ? 
Flies can see more than we, 
So how bright their eyes must be; 
Little fly, 
Ope your eye, 
Spiders are near by. 
For a 
secret I 
can tell— 
Spiders never use flies well; 
Then away, 
Do not stay ; 
Little fly, good-day.

BETTER THAN GOLIt. 
By 
HARRY BURNS. 
Written for A. L 
nr. 
Au.—" Kiss Me Again." 
ONE in this bright world to me is fair, 
Voice like an angel and dark flowing hair. 
Sweetly does life give moments of bliss, 
Sealing our love with an angelic kiss. 
Swiftly the moments are passing away, 
Quickly the dawn of life is turning gray ; 
But every moment, as life is growing old, 
Tells me I 
love you far better than gold. 
C11011US. 
Better than gold with sweet thoughts I 
love thee, 
Nothing can ever unfold, 
Better than gold with feelings untold ; 
Darling, I 
love you far better than gold. 
When your dark eyes are beaming in mine, 
Firing my heart like the nectar of wine, 
Thou art ever the same unto me, 
Filling my bosom with love's ecstacy, 
Wafting my soul to the realms of the blest, 
Passing and leaving love's wild unrest ; 
Then if you love me why treat me so cold ? 
Whom my heart praises far better than gold. 
Better than gold, etc, 
'Would you still love, through trouble and woe ? 
Follow my footsteps wherever I 
go ? 
Ever to thee my poor heart will cling, 
Loving and trusting whatever may bring. 
Let ill betide or lay at thy door, 
Still I 
will love thee the same evermore. 
All the sweet secrets my heart can unfold 
Tells me I 
love you far better than gold. 
Better than gold, ate.

Though fortune frown and coldly spurn, 
And mine a

The sights of the city enchanted me so, 
I 
thought it a 
fine place to dwell.

And they dress up so stylish and gay ; 
There was one that produced an impression on me, 
'T was a 
lady I

sweet face, 
I

Oh, she was a

For the lady I 
met on Broadway ! 
I 
made an appointment to meet her next day, 
And dress'd up as gay as could be ; 
I 
took her down town to a 
grand matinee, 
Then went to her home to have tea. 
-What I 
saw in that house I 
shall never forget, 
I 
left in surprise and dismay ; 
There were six little children all crying " mamma," 
To the lady I 
met on Broadway ! 
She walk'd with, etc. 
She smiled and remark'd, " I'm a: widow you know 
And these are my six little dears ; 
They make the house lively and banish my woe, 
Tho',oft I 
have sad, silent tears." 
I 
bade her farewell, with my love all subdued. 
At home now I 
think I 
will stay ; 
Henceforth I'm resolv'd never more to be caught 
By the ladies I 
meet on Broadway !

Think music and dancing divine, 
While yet to prevent my enjoyment of these, 
A 
very great failing is mine. 
Now some may be called too pert or too bold, 
Or eagar to peep or to pry. 
I'm neither of these, for my trouble is this, 
I'm really so awfully shy.

went, 
And danced with Augustus, and when 
The dance was concluded I 
thought to myself, 
He's really the nicest of men. 
He said, shall we go for a 
walk on the lawn ? 
The moon is quite bright in the sky. 
I 
wished to say yes, but I 
had to say no, 
Because I 
felt awfully shy.

DON'T be sighing, little darling, 
Better days will come again,

So we'll fondly cling together,

Sunshine follows after rain; 
Though the shadows now are falling, 
Better days will come again. 
Don't be sighing, little darling, 
Come and sit beside me now, 
Though your tresses once were golden, 
Time has silvered o'er your brow. 
Days of sorrow wandered near us, 
But our love is still as pure, 
'While adown the hill we journey. 
Ever more it shall endure. 
Don't be sighing, etc. 
Don't be sighing, little darling, 
Brighter skies will shine above, 
Life is gladness, hope is round us, 
While our hearts are full of love. 
Oh, your smiles can make it summer, 
Though the wintry days may blight, 
We will fondly cling together, 
As we've done in days so bright.

Whom Gen. Howard derides, for they fool him to their 
heart's most great content. 
I'll have England's rifle corps, stopping home on John 
Bull's shore 
A 
losing team beneath this circus tent. 
I'll have the Count Johannes stand, the crushed trage-
dian of this land, 
Our President, who cold water does take, 
Going up in a 
balloon, with Dr. Mary Walker's panta-
loons, 
While he tips Susan Anthony the wink. 
I'll have James Gordon Bennett drawn, fighting duels in 
a 
horn, 
As he stood in Delaware and shot the bull. 
I'll have the great George Francis Train playing poker 
with Jim Blaine, 
And Babcock drinking whiskey till he's full. 
I'll have Christianity at work, killing off that nasty Turk, 
And all you people smiling with content, 
If you'll stand up in a 
row, as I 
give my little show, 
Beneath the canvas of my circus tent.

HIGH in my window two love- birds 
Hung in their cage for a 
summer long ; 
Their passion had not the relief of words.. 
And they did not appear to know a 
song; 
But there they nestled upon the perch, 
Beak to beak in a 
loveable way, 
Like two young lovers just fresh from church, 
And a 
look in their eyes that seemed to say— 
CHORUS. 
Hours, go by, 
Let them fly, * 
We'll mark them with a 
kiss. 
Hours go by, 
Let them fly, * 
The time we pass in kissing, 
The time we pass in kissing 
Is time we never miss. 
My birds' example spread far and wide ; 
There in the window they kiss'd and coo'd, 
'Till it soften'd the hearts of folks outside, 
And quite affected the neighborhood ; 
And love grew in fashion more and yet more ; 
All thro' the terrace flirtation so rag'd, 
That no one of twenty, few of two score, 
But was either just wed or else engaged. 
CHORUS. 
Kiss and coo, 
I 
and you, * • * 
Take our delight in this. 
Kiss and coo, 
I 
and you, 
To share a 
perch together, 
To share a 
perch together, 
And kiss and kiss and kiss. 
Mv aged granny, a 
prim old dame, 
Was wholly perturb'd at their wooing ways : 
What forward things, I 
am flil'd with shame. 
No birds so acted in my young days, 
Their brazen immodesty pray disown, 
And send the creatures at once to roost; 
You ought to provide them a 
chaperone, 
And see them properly introduced. 
Kiss and coo, etc.

THE LOVE-BIRD'S KISS.—Concludea. 
At last came some one too see the birds; 
Somebody came, I 
won't tell who, 
But he heed them of me with pleading words; 
Ask'd for them and their mistress too : 
And some how, 1 
and that foolish man, 
Tho' how it happen'd I 
cannot swear, 
Agreed to follow the Love- bird's plan, 
And make two couples instead of a 
pair. 
Kiss and coo, etc. 
KISS, KISS.

rapture deeper, dearer. 
Love's symbol and its seal of bliss, 
When hearts and lips come nearer, nearer, 
And language melts into a 
kiss ! 
CHORUS 
Ali! Leaves on the tree, 
Flow'r and the bee ! 
To the waters glowing, winds are kisses blowing! 
Matron and maid, 
None are afraid, 
Sign of all our earthly bliss is this, a 
kiss ; 
Tho' many a 
false kiss bath been given ! 
Tho' many a 
lip bath fei,c,m'd its love! 
A 
kiss came none the less from heaven. 
It must be right, ' tis done above ! 
tffection bath no image purer. 
Then if a 
maid be over coy, 
Let this reflection reassure her, 
That angels quite approve the joy 1

WHY CAN'T I HAVE A BEAU ? 
Copyright, 186, by E. 
II . 
HARDING, Music Publisler, 229 Bowitry, N Y 
Price 10 cents. 
As Sung by BERTHA For. 
I THINK it's very cruel— 
Now here I'm seventeen, 
And have not got a 
lover— 
A " Beau," of course, I 
mean, 
There's lots of charming fellows, 
Who smile and flirt with me ; 
But mamma says, when older, 
'Tis time enough, you see! 
CHORUS. 
Why can't I 
have a 
beau ? 
I'm sure I'd like to know ! 
I'm sure it's wrong to wait so long— 
Why can't I 
have beau ? 
I 
never go to parties 
Without Papa, you know, 
Who watches me so closely— 
Oh ! ain't it awful slow ? 
He takes me home so early, 
While other girls they stay, 
And with some charming fellow 
They pass the hours away. 
Why can't I 
have a 
beau ? eta. 
If I 
should go a 
walking 
And meet some one I 
knew, 
And he should see me safely_ 
At home, then say, adieu ! 
If I 
should ask him kindly, 
A 
moment to come in, 
Papa would say, 'twas awful ! 
And mamma, such a 
sin ! 
Why can't I 
have a 
beau ? etc. 
I'm growing quite discouraged, 
I 
am, upon my word ; 
I 
won't be any longer 
Kept shut up like a 
bird. 
This world was made for pleasure; 
Then I 
am bound to try 
And see a 
little of it, 
That some folks would deny. 
Why can't I 
have a 
beau ? etc,

SOME time ago they gave a 
show, 
That caused sensation great— 
In Gotham's Grand Fifth Avenue, 
It's sights I 
will relate. 
There mothers sighed, while babies cried, 
Yet not a 
tear did flow ; 
The kids would whine most all the time, 
Up at the Baby Show. 
CHORUS. 
Such a 
squalling, such a 
bawling, 
They set up around that floor, 
Pa, pa, pa ! ma, ma, ma ! 
They continually did roar. 
Some had two, some had three, 
How they do it I 
don't know ; 
It was a 
curious sight indeed, 
The New York Baby Show. 
As you walked along with the buzzing throng, 
Quite frequent you would hear, 
" 
You little darling," " tootsy wootsy," 
" 
Please let me hold the dear." 
" 
Aint she nice," " you pearl of price," 
All sitting in a 
row ; 
They'd rub the thumb against the gum, 
Up at the Baby Show. 
Such a 
squalling, etc. 
Another day I 
chanced, that way, 
Inspected the cherubs well ; 
One took my eye as passing by, 
Oh couldn't she pout and yell, 
Up in my arms, admired its charms, 
You've Ril been there I 
know, 
Upon my vest—you know the rest, 
Up at the Baby Show.

I'VE a 
emket at home that is filled with precious gems ; 
I 
have pictures of friends dear to me, 
And I've trinkets so rare, that came many years ago, 
From my far distant home across the sea. 
But there's one sweet little treasure that I'll ever dearly 
prize, 
Better far than all the wealth beneath the wave ; 
Tho' a 
small faded flow'ret, that I 
placed in childhood's 
days. 
'Tis a 
flower from my angel mother's grave. 
CHORUS. 
Treasured in my mem'ry like a 
happy dream, 
Are the loving words she gave, 
And my heart fondly cleaves to the dry and withered 
leaves— 
'Tis a 
flower from my angel mother's grave. 
In the quiet country churchyard they laid her down to 
sleep ; 
Close beside the old home she's at rest, 
And the low, sacred mound is enshrined within my heart, 
By the sweet ties of love forever blest. 
In the still and silent night I 
often dream of home again, 
And the vision ever tells me to be brave; 
For the last link that binds me to the place I 
love so 
well, 
Is the flower from my angel mother's grave. 
Treasured in my memory, etc.

THIS earth now seems lonely and dreary, 
My darling ! my loved one ! my own ! 
Thy spirit bath flown and I'm weary, 
Yes, weary of watching alone. 
Oh, come back to me, but one moment, 
If only to say thou art prone 
To pity the one who implGres thee, 
-Whose heart is fast turning to stone ; 
Think fondly of one who adores thee, 
And that may thy absence atone! 
CHORUS. 
My tears like the dew are now falling for thee, 
My soul: thine affection cloth crave ; 
May storms never blight—ever green may it be— 
The grass o'er my loy'd one's grave. 
My heart is nigh breaking with sorrow, 
Mine eyes no more luster can show, 
I 
dread ev'ry coming to- morrow, 
And each night still darker cloth grow. 
If I 
only knew you were waiting 
To clasp me again as of yore, 
I'd watch and I'd wait unrepining, 
Till life and its struggles are o'er, 
And look up to Heav'n's starry grating, 
To see if you stood at the door! 
My tears like the dews, etc.

You'LL see a 
crowd of howling swells, wherever you do 
go, 
But let me warn you not to trust too much in outside show; 
For many a 
gent whose weekly pay to keep hint scarce af-
fords, 
Would have the girls believe that at Delmonico's he boards. 
CHORUS . 
Oh! he's tricky, tricky, tricky, 
His conduct's very often sharp and tricky, 
He never lets you catch him, for he's always " fly;" 
Oh! he's tricky, tricky, tricky. 
You'd think Fitzjames Adolphus Brown a 
howling swell 
enough, 
For up at Saratoga he shcws no end of cuff, 
But if you saw his washing bill 'twould give your nerves 
a 
shock, 
For a 
pair of cuffs and " dickey " you'd find were all his 
stock. 
CHORUS . 
Oh! he's tricky, tricky, tricky, 
His linen is comprised of cuff and " dickey ;" 
He never lets you catch him, for he's always " fly:" 
Oh! he's tricky, tricky, tricky. 
He wears a 
lovely golden chain, which seems of value rare, 
Which, when he strolls about Broadway, he never fails to 
wear; 
But when he goes to Long Branch that chain is never seen, 
For the sea air turns its color to a 
very bilious green. 
SPOKEN.— It looks an eighteen-carater— 
But it's, etc. 
A 
little eyeglass in his eye he vainly tries to stick, 
And has to screw his features up before he does the trick; 
But if he falls against a 
stone a 
change comes o'er his phiz, 
For he has to take his eyeglass out to find out what it is. 
Oh! he's tricky, tricky, tricky, etc. 
He comes out strongly in the spring in fifteen-dollar suits, 
He wears a 
pair of gaiters, just to cover up his boots: 
The gaiters seem to serve a 
useful purpose, on the whole, 
For his boots consist of uppers, with a 
very little sole. 
Oh! he's tricky, tricky, tricky, etc.

To the first man that comes in ii,y way,

His looks I'll try to depict; 
He squints with his left eye, just so, 
And scowls as if he had been licked. 
Oh, he walks with a 
gold headed cane, 
lie's lean and as thin as a 
bat, 
And over his carroty fiery- red hair, 
He wears a 
shocking bad hat.

I've advertised over the land, 
To find my false lover in vain, 
And now I 
have given him up, 
I 
never shall see him again; 
Oh, but if he should some time come back, 
I 
tell you I'd , ,ive him a

THE rich complain at Fortune's frown,

To pay his lodging bill ;

trifle more

Then keep your spirits light and gay, 
And sing this hopeful strain, 
We'll all be happy by-and-by, 
When the good times come again. 
The man of toil is now at rest, 
Ilis rent is coming due ; 
His purse is empty, but his heart 
Is honest, proud, and true ; 
He smiles at each succeeding cross, 
And does not sigh in vain ; 
He knows the tide of life will change

Then keep your spirits, etc.

Tier kiss he can't refuse ;

But now she asks in vain; 
All he can say is, " Yes, my dear, 
When the good times come again." 
Then keep your spirits, etc. 
The lover looks with wistful eyes 
Upon his bride to be ; 
She begs him to be good and wise, 
Till brighter days they see ; 
They kiss and part, while in each heart 
Sweet hopes of joy remain ; 
some day they'll wed, but they must wait 
Till the good times come again. 
Then keep your spirits, etc,

SWEET THE SONG OF 13IRDS‘ 
As sung by Miss CARRY. 
ONCE upon a 
time there lived a 
maiden 
In a 
little cottage by the sea ; 
Twining round about, it heavy laden, 
Grew a 
honeysuckle fair to see ; 
And the maiden watched the blossom daily, 
Heard the bees about it as it grew, 
Bent about it singing ever gayly, 
Ev'ry bird and ev'ry blossom knew 
When the wind a 
leaf blew down, 
Came a 
sudden dainty frown ; 
Greater love she did not know, 
No! greater love she did not know, know, know, know, 
know. 
To the maiden came one day a 
lover, 
Tall and brave and full of manly grace, 
Whispering tender words, he bent above her, 
Stooped and kissed her sunny, smiling face ;. 
Underneath the honeysuckle walked they, 
But her eyes were cast demurely down ; 
Seeing not, as softly, sweetly talked they, 
flow its leaves were turning sere and brown, 
Withered now its tendrils twine, 
Bird and bee have left the rine, 
Careless is the maid, I 
trow, 
Greater love bath learned to know. 
Yes I 
greater love hath learned to know, know, know. 
know, know.

NAPOLEON'S ORACULUM, 
OR, 
BOOK OF FATE. 
The only Complete Amerionn, from the Fiftieth 
London Edition. 
This is the oldest, and for that very reason the best of Fortune Tellers-
It was compiled in the remote ages, when learned men consulted the stars, 
and watched and interpreted the decrees of fate, and inquired into and 
often mastered the mysteries of what we vaguely term Chance. 
Certain it 
is, that Bonaparte obtained a 
copy of this book, written upon papyrus. 
He 
chriously consults it. 
From that time a 
gloom overspread his massive brow. 
Did it dimly reveal to him -11i0SCOW, Waterloo, St. Helena ? We only know 
it was found in his carriage after Ids last great fight. 
Tens of thousands 
consult this Oraculum with daily increasing fan, in its truthful answering&
