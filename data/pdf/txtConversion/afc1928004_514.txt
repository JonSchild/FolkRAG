My Mother-in-law, 
Sung with great success by HARRY McAvov at the London Theatre, 
New York, in the sketch of " Jealousy or Two Can Play at that 
Game," and in all the principal theatres in America. 
If you'll listen while I 
will sing you a 
ditty— 
It's about the worst woman that ever you saw, 
And when you have heard it you'll say it's a 
pity 
That ever I 
had such a 
mother-in-law. 
Whatever I 
do she is always fault finding, 
Wherever I 
goshe is sure to be there, 
And if I 
don't do why just as she asks me. 
She will help herself to a 
lock of my hair. 
CHORUS. 
My life is all troubles, I 
cannot live happy, 
If I 
open my mouth she will shove in her jaw, 
I'd rather be sent to jail or to congress 
Than to live all my life with my mother-in-law. 
Now she is so ugly she frightens the children 
Whenever she happens to go out in the street, 
She's a 
hole in het mouth like a 
crack in a 
pumpkin, 
A 1 
ump on her back— I'll never mention her feet, 
And :Ale's got a 
notion that she is good-looking, 
Though her face is the worst one that ever was seen, 
And when she sits down to have her picture taken, 
The very first squint she breaks the machine. 
My life is, & c. 
Now I 
told her one day when I 
married her daughter, 
That I 
did not intend the whole family to wed, 
When she quick helped herself to a 
bucket of water 
And taking good aim let it fly at my head. 
Now I've heard that they had some good shooting at 
Creedmoor, 
And the shots were so close they were all but a 
draw, 
;tit I'd give ten dollars to any good shooter, 
That could rid me at once of my motht:-in-law. 
My life is, &c.

Bonny Green Isle. 
Written by BARRY CARTER for Miss EMMA ROGERS, and sung by her 
with great success. 
There's a 
bonny green isle way over the sea, 
Where the boys and the girls are light-hearted and free. 
It's the land of the beautiful shamrock so green, 
And the prettiest country that ever was seen. 
But the shamrock by law is forbidden to grow 
13y black-hearted tyrants; but soon with the foe 
An array of patriots determined you'll see, 
Who will fight Johnny Bull till old Ireland is free. 
Oh, the boys won't forget ',
98, I 
am sure, 
When the widow and orphan was drove from the (Icor 
When Emmet, the patriot, was strung on a 
tree 
On that bonnie green isle way over the sea. 
Soon shall the day come when each valley and glen 
Shall re-echo the war-cry of bold Irish men. 
From oppressors and tyrants may they ever be free, 
On that bonnie green isle way over the sea. 
• 
My Wife Betty. 
Written by HARRY MCAVOY, and sung by him in the original sketch en-
titled " 
Going to the Raffle." 
Now I 
have got a 
little wife, 
She's sweeter far than life, 
But oh, she plagues me all day long— 
She's the torment of my life. 
You'll always hear her singing sweet, 
She never can keep still, 
Her voice is heard in every room, 
It is so loud and shrilL 
CHORUS. 
I 
love Betty, when she's singing; 
I 
love Betty, she's tormenting ; 
She's my darling, she's my treasure ; 
Why, she's all the world to me. 
(Repeat.) 
She is an Irish girl so sweet, 
And I 
loved her so well ; 
We met, ' twas by the river, 
And our tales of rove did tell. 
I 
asked her then to be my wife, 
Of course I 
will, says she. 
We're married now and well content 
In this land of the free. 
I 
love Betty, &c.

The Man that Knew the Actors. 
Written and sung by JOHN MCVEIGH. Dedicated to my friend HARRY 
NIcAvoy. 
Of a 
queer young man I'm going to -tell, 
And every one of you know him well; 
He's rather a 
sort of a 
dizzy swell, 
The man that knew the actors. 
He knew every actor, both east and west, 
The highest, the lowest, the least, the best ; 
In fact he would never give you a 
rest, 
The man that knew the actors. 
He knew Frank Girard, Charles White and Pat Rooney; 
When he spoke of Add Ryman he nearly went " looney." 
He knew both the Tonys, Pastor and Hart, 
And said he gave Harrigan his very first start. 
He knew John Wild, Johnny Shay and Bill Gray; 
And he knew Bill Thompson, wrote many a 
play. 
He knew Billy Barry as well as his mother, 
And Frank Bennett to him was as dear as a 
brother; 
Watson and Ellis he knew thoroughly well, 
And he put in the business John and Henry Kernell. 
He knew the Deveres, both Samuel and Billy, 
And he raised Cool Burgess, who knocked the " guys" silly; 
Gus Williams, he said, is a 
great friend of mine, 
" 
He eats nothing but birds, and drinks nothing but wine." 
Lew Simmonds and Richmond are two of his pards, 
And Sanford and Wilson enjoy his regards. 
THE MAN THAT KNEW THE ACTORS. 
Continued. 
Billy Emerson and Newcomb are two of his friends, 
And to Schoolcraft and Coes his best wishes extends ; 
He knows Hughey Dougherty, and of him spoke well, 
And he lived in the same house with Senator Bell. 
Delehanty and Heng,ler, Harry Thompson and McKee 
Were many times out with him on a 
good " spree." 
He gave Charley Diamond his first lesson in music, 
And writes all the songs for Bill Morton and Gulick. 
He knows Backus and Wambold, and fat Billy Birch, 
They introduced him to Thatcher one day in a 
church. 
Billy Carter, Jaques, Kruger and himself are quite thick, 
He knows all the Nortons, including one they call Nick ; 
Milt Barlow, George Wilson, and West and Primrose, 
Wouldn's lose his good will for a 
million of shows. 
He knows Larry Tooley, Joe Lang, and Ned West, 
And Cummings, and Harrington, his friendship attest. 
He knew Quilter and Goldrich, and old Walter Bray, 
In fact, he knows every actor in the country to- day. 
He knows people that were dead for ninety-nine years, 
And whenever he spoke of them he always shed tears. 
A Mick who was listening to him a 
couple of hours, 
Said: " Do you know a 
young man by the name of Ed Powers?" 
He said he did not—and could you suppose 
That the terrier thumped him square on the nose, 
Saying: " Ye're a 
liar," as his ear he did eat, 
And made a 
kick at his neck as he ran in the street ; 
And now he knows no actor.

Bold Musketeer. 
Written for EMMA ROGERS by NED STRAIGHT, and sung by her in all the 
Vaudeville theatres in the country with great success. 
Oh, I 
wish that I'd been born a 
man, 
So that breeches I 
could wear ; 
I'd go in for mirth and jollity, 
And sometimes have a 
tear. 
But the height of my ambition— 
For unknown to me is fear— 
Is to shoulder arms for your country 
As a 
brave bold musketeer. 
CHORUS. 
Forward March! 
And never be caught in the rear. 
Right 'Wheel ! 
March away! (Drum Solo.) 
I 
am a 
bold musketeer. 
I 
must have a 
soldier for my beau, 
For they are so very kind; 
He must have a 
mustache long and black, 
Just suited to my mind; 
And he must be tall and handsome, 
Such a 
one I 
could revere, 
That's the only one I 
could marry, 
Is a 
brave bold musketeer. 
Forward March, &c. 
Words by GEORGE COOPER, M USIC 
by CHARLES PRATT, and sung witb 
great success by HARRY McAvov. 
" 
Ring down the curtain !" the last act is o'er, 
The sad play of life is now past ; 
One more is nearing the dark, unknown shore, 
The moments are waning so fast! 
Far from the burden, the tumult and strife, 
While tears dimm'd each sorrowing eye ; 
Sad was the whisper, the last words of life: 
" 
It's no use, God bless you! Good-bye !" 
CHORUS. 
"Ring down the curtain !" 
Oh, sweet be the sleep 
That waits the kind-hearted on high ! 
Fondly this mem'ry the heart now will keep ; 
" 
It's no use, God bless you, God bless you, good-bye!" 
" 
Ring down the curtain !" no more shall we see 
The sweet smile so kindly and true ; 
Dim are the eyes that once sparkled with glee, 
The hopes that were bright as the clew. 
Dear is the vision that mem'ry recalls, 
To hearts that forever must sigh ; 
Sad is the echo that lingering falls : 
" 
It's no use, God bless you ! Good-bye !" 
" 
Ring down the curtain !" & c,

Bye, Bye, Mick. 
Written and sung only by HARRY McAvov, at the London Theatre, N. Y. 
Here I 
am, an Irishman, I'd have you for to know, 
I 
always make my self at home no matter where I 
go. 
I 
know all the blackguards stand on the corner here below, 
And insult decent people as they pass to and fro. 
Every night when I 
go out, oh at me they will shout: 
Will you stag the old flannel-mouth! 
Go shoot that hat quick, you old coffin-back Mick ! 
Yes, this is what those blackguards say to me. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, yes, bye bye Mick will hit you with a 
brick, 
Some druggist ought to hire you to make people sick, 
I'll meet you on the corner some Sunday when you're out! 
Yes, that's the way these rowdies at me shout. 
(Repeat.) 
At night now, when my work is done, and to walk I 
feel 
inclined, 
It's down on the corner these boys I'm sure to find, 
With their Piccadilly collars and their skinny tight light pants, 
They look like dancing masters just imported here from France. 
Every night when I 
go out, why at me they will shout: 
Oh, stag the old flannel-mouth! 
Go shoot that hat quick, you old coffin-back Mick! 
Yes, that is what these blackguards say to me. 
Oh, yes, bye bye, &c.

Old Paddy Malone, 
Written by HARRY McAvoY, aud sung by him in the American Theatre, 
New York, with great success. 
I 
have just come out before you 
To•tell you who I 
am— 
I 
am not Michael O'Mara, 
Or Muldoon, the solid man, 
I 
am not Mulcahy, that went away, 
And that's to you well known. 
But a 
finer old Mick you never can find 
Than I, old Paddy Malone. 
CHORUS. 
For I'm old Paddy Malone, ha! ha! 
Yes', I'm old Paddy Malone. 
And a 
finer old gent you never can find 
(Ha! ha! old man's laugh.) 
Than I, old Paddy Malone. 
I'm growing old and feeble, 
And my hair is turning gray, 
Still I 
strive to be cheerful, 
And drive dull care away. 
I 
can sing a 
song or crack a 
joke, 
And make myself at home, 
And a 
finer old gent you never can find 
Than I, old Paddy Malone. 
For I'm old Paddy, &c.

Peeping Through the Lattice. 
Written by HARRY McAvoy for EMMA ROGERS, and sung with great 
success in Ford's Opera House, Washington, D. C. 
I 
wonder why the boys all say that I'm a 
flirt? 
I 
never broke a 
heart, and feelings will not hurt. 
My business is at home, as soon as school is done, 
Peeping through the lattice, boys, oh that is jolly fun. 
CHORUS. 
Peeping through the lattice, flirting with the boys, 
Throwing now and then a 
kiss, kicking up a 
noise; 
Getting all the bald-heads on a 
little string, 
Peeping through the lattice, that's a 
jolly thing. 
(Repeat.) 
They say that I 
am wild, and call me a 
coquette, 
But there is one I 
like, he is my darling pet. 
He oft' sits by my side watching every one; 
Peeping through the lattice, yes, you bet it's jolly fun. 
CHORUS. 
Peeping through the lattice, flirting with the boys, 
Throwin now and then a 
kiss, kicking up a 
noise; 
Getting all the bald-heads on a 
little string, 
Peeping through the lattice, that's a 
jolly thing. 
(Repeat.)

McAvoy, the Man of Education. 
Written by HARRY McAvoy, and sung with unbounded applause. 
Oh, good evening to you, I 
thought I'd make a 
call, 
And I'll tell you of my name and occupation. 
I 
am lately in this town, I'm a 
man of great renown, 
And I'm called McAvoy, the man of education. 
CHORUS. 
I 
can read and I 
can write, both English and French, 
German, Italian, or any other nation; 
And as I 
do walk the street everyone that I 
meet 
Says, there goes McAvoy, the man of education. 
I 
never mix in politics, I'll have you for to know, 
I 
always mind my business, and find I've got plenty 
for to do; 
But if I 
was a 
politician, there's one thing that I 
know, 
The people would know what party I 
belonged to, no 
matter where I 
go. 
CHORUS. 
I 
can read, I 
can write, both English and French, 
German, Italian, or any other nation; 
And as I 
walk the street everyone that I 
meet 
Says, there goes McAvoy, the man of education.

I'll Tell Nobody. 
As sung by EMMA ROGERS in the original sketch written by H ARRY M C' 
Avov, entitled " Going to the Raffle." 
Oh, I 
am in love, but I'll not tell with whom, 
For I 
know very well what some folks would do— 
They'd chatter and flatter and make themselves fine, 
And poor little somebody have a 
sad time. 
CHORUS. 
So I'll tell nobody, I'll tell nobody, 
I'll tell nobody, nobody, no. 
So I'll tell nobody, I'll tell nobody, 
I'll tell nobody, nobody, no. 
If I'd tell it to one she would tell it to two, 
The next cup of tea they'd plot what they'd do. 
And as men have no constancy in their own minds, 
He'd seek a 
new face and leave some one behind. 
So I'll tell nobody, & c. 
But when I 
am sure that his heart's all my own, 
That he loves me sincerely and never will roam, 
Oh, then I'll defy all their jeers and their taunts, 
For it shows very plain what it is each of them wants. 
CHORUS. 
They all want somebody, they're dying for somebody, 
Somebody, somebody, I 
know who. 
So I'll tell nobody, I'll tell nobody ; 
I'll tell nobody, nobody, no. 
Nothing In It. 
Written for Miss MAGGIE FOSTER, the beautiful vocalist. 
Some folks think money makes us all, 
While others think they're wrong, 
But your attention I 
will ask 
To this, my little song. 
To make a 
break or sad mistake, 
Think well ere you begin it, 
You'll find, my friends, when it's too late, 
That there is nothing in it. 
CHORUS. 
Now don't make love to the girls you see, 
Think well before you begin it; 
For they will give you a 
hearty laugh 
And say there's nothing in it. 
The many smiles I 
see each night 
As on the stage I 
walk, 
Create sensation and delight, 
And all the critics talk. 
Now there's a 
young man sitting there, 
To mash he'll soon begin it ; 
Of the girls that's here he had better keep clear, 
For he'll find there's nothing in it. 
Now don't make love, & c. 
The Irish Politician. 
Sung by H ARRY McAvoY with great success at the London Theatre, 
N. Y., and all the principal theatres in the United States. 
I'm an Irish politician, and I 
hold a 
high position 
And I 
just come out here to tell ye'se that 
I 
cast a 
couple of votes on last election day, 
And now I'm called a 
solid Democrat. 
In the ward where I 
belong the Republicans were strong, 
They holler out, and this is what they say: 
Oh there goes'a politician, and he holds a 
high position, 
And he'll run for Congress next election day. 
CHORUS. 
With the hat on the side of my head, sure I 
kill them all 
dead. 
They holler out, and this is what they say: 
Oh there goes a 
politician, and he holds a 
high position, 
Oh he'll run for Congress next election day. 
When election first begun, Samuel Tilden was the man 
For to take it in his head and put it through. 
He was beaten by a 
set that we never can forget ; 
Next election day we'll show them something new. 
When I 
do walk the street, every hi chard that I 
meet, 
They holler out, and this is what they say : 
Oh there goes a 
politician, and he hold, a 
high position ; 
Oh he'll run for Congress next election day. 
With the hat, &c. 
Sung by EMMA ROGERS, in the sketch written for her by NED STRAIGHT, 
entitled: " Jealousy ; or, Two can Play at that Game." 
Where are all the words endearing 
That my darling used to say ? 
Where the tones that were so cheering ? 
Oh bring them back to me, I 
pray. 
They say that he is false to me, 
Has brought upon me deepest shame; 
Yet bring him back where'er he be, 
For, oh, I 
love him all the same. 
CHORUS. 
Tho' the ocean rolls between us, 
X- 
4' 
Tho' upon his name's a 
stain, 
Tho' he languish in a 
prison, 
Still I 
love him all the same. 
When we parted in the arbor, 
Sweet to me the kiss he gave, 
As his ship saii'd from the harbor 
My heart was lonely as the grave. 
Three long and weary years have fled, 
One letter only from him came, 
"I'm coming back to you," he said, 
And oh, I 
love him all the same.

Taking a 
Smoke. 
Written for and sung by HARRY 1
1/
41cAvoY, in the sketch entitled: 
"Jealousy; or, Two can Play at that Game." 
One day I 
sat smoking a 
fragrant segar, 
My thoughts wandering from hither and thither afar ; 
l'he smoke curling upwards brought scenes to my eye, 
Which caused me to wonder, to laugh and to sigh. 
I'll show you the visions which over me broke— 
'Twas the way that I 
saw it while taking a 
smoke. 
(Repeat last two lines.) 
The first that I 
saw was Colonel Jim Fisk, 
lie was feeding the poor and made business quite brisk ; 
But Stokes, the assassin, I 
also saw there, 
He wa.; hitched to a 
rope, hanging high in the air. 
Now these were the visions that over me broke— 
I 
thought it was real, but ' twas only the smoke. 
(Repeat last two lines.) 
The next that I 
saw was a 
crowd in the street, 
'Twas a 
father and son, they did heartily greet ; 
They shouted and hollered three cheers with a 
main— 
Charley Ross had been found, and has come home again. 
Now these were the visions which over me broke— 
I 
thought it was real, but ' twas only the smoke. 
(Repeat last two lines.)

PATRICK MIND THE BABY! 
Sang in HARRIGAN and HAP.T ie Gteat SkeI.ch of the " Bradys,' 
Copyrighted 1876. 
A.1, FisliER, 93 Nassau St., New York.. 
I'm the father of a 
bouncing girl, 
With cheeks like cherries red; 
She's a 
credit to the neighborhood, 
I'm only twelve months wed. 
When I 
come home from labor 
After toiling all the day, 
Me wife puts .Nelly in me arms, 
And this to to me did say— 
Arrab Patrick mind the baby, 
Arrah can't you mind the child! 
Tie it up in an over- coat, 
She's surely going wild. 
Arrah Patrick mind the baby, 
Mind the child awhilel 
She'll kick and bite, 
And cry all night, 
Arrah Patrick mind the child. 
There was castor-oil, and soothing syrup, 
And paregoric to, 
Was give to the child when she had fits, 
But nothing would bring her to; 
She'd put mustard plasters on her feet, 
And give her a 
bowl of tea, 
And then she'd lay her in my arms, 
And this to me would say— 
Arrah Patrick mind the baby, &o. 
Ali when Nelly grew up to a 
lady, 
I 
had no control at tall; 
She'd say I 
am no baby, 
As she waltz away to a 
ball. 
Bad luck to me joy there came a. boy 
Last St. Patrick's day; 
Me wife put Patsy in me arms, 
And this to me did say— 
Arrah Patrick mind the baby,

GOD HELP OUR SUFFERING POOR, 
Written and sung by W ILL. H. 
MORTON with HARRIGAN 
HART'S Combinatica. 
While the sad cry of hard times resound through our land 
Do we give enough thought to the poor; 
Are we one and all ready to lend helping hand, 
To drive the grim wolf from the door. 
The selfish may think that kind fortune has dealt, 
With them and thelf own to secure 
The comforts and blessings that money can bring, 
But God help our suffering poor. 
There are plenty we meet who could help if they would, 
But the fact is their money's all spent; 
They're too poor themselves, or they ain't in the mood, 
Or some other excuse they'll invent. 
But ask you rich banker how much in his vaults 
These men have placed there to secure; 
And he'll tell you, if honest, their assertions are fah*, 
They could help our suffering poor. 
Can any one tell why those seeking for aid 
Always pass millionaires with distrust? 
Can it be solemn .ruth, what I've often heard said, 
That the rich seldom give e'en a 
crust? 
But there's the mechanic and laboring man, 
Ever ready to share hg small StOrp, 
For nearly each one knows how ' tis himself, 
God bless these true friends to the poor.

Gas House Explosion.

Written and sung by the SPARES BROTHERS, in their original sketch, 
entitled: " The Gas House Explosion," and performed in all the 
principal Theatres throughout the United States, 
Copyrighted by A, J, FISHER, I879. 
Good evening to you, one and all, 
We just come out for to sing to you a 
song •, 
It is all about when we landed in America, 
And we won't detain you long. 
When we first landed in America 
We were hired for a 
dollar a 
day, 
Shoveling smoke down in the gas house— 
And all the Irish boys would say: 
CHORUS. 
(Break.) 
Come all you boys and join together, 
Hands all round, and we'll all say shake. 
Balance all and swing your partners, 
All the Irish boys would say. (Repeat Chorus.) 
When we first landed in Castle Garden 
We went up-town to buy us some flutes, 
And we went over on the Bowery 
And all the boys said we were galutes. ( Break.) 
And now, kind friends, we must be going, 
For with you we cannot stay; 
We must go back to the gas house 
Where we get our dollar a 
day. 
Come all you boys, &c.

I 
know a 
pretty little girl, she lives just down the street, 
If you see her when she's out walking, you'll say that 
she is sweet. 
Her mother keeps a 
grocery store, 
Her brother drives a 
dray, 
Her father is a 'longshoreman, 
And she tends store all day. 
CHORUS. 
Her name is Biddy Ann McCarthy, 
Her eyes are blue and she is hearty, 
She takes the prize at every party, 
And we call her Biddy Ann, that's her name. (Sym) 
We'll married be in a 
short time; what pleasures we will 
share, 
We'll raise a 
little family up , they'll be our only care, 
We'll move' outside the city, 
Myself and little wife, 
And with our children, ever near, 
Be happy all our life. 
(Chorus.)

I 
live in a 
brown stone tenement, 
With green shutters painted white ; 
There's a 
family of cats lives in the rear, 
They play " Pinafore" every night. 
They sing something about Maria, 
And the times are very hard; 
Oh, they'll chew tobacco and spit in your eye, 
The cats in our back yard. 
CHORUS. 
Tral a 
le, tral a 
la, 
For the cats in our back yard. 
(Repeat.) 
They have walking matches on the fence, 
Have picnics in the cellar; 
I 
threw seventy bricks at a 
Thomas, 
You ought to hear them beller. 
They sing alto, base, and tenor, 
Oh, they ought to be feathered and tarred! 
Oh, they are worse than Ilaverley's Minstrels, 
Yes, the cats in our back yard.

Levi Kassiday. 
IRISH COMIC SONG. 
Written, composed and sung by J. E. MtnPELT, of lifunnErr & Macs 
In the laughable sketch, entitled " The Secret 
Published and copyrighted 1879, by E. H. lanorso's, 229 Bowery and 
sent to any address, post-paid, on receipt of 35 cents. 
Now list ye to my classic lay, 
Politely hearken loudly, while 
I 
sing of Levi Kassiday, 
A 
blazing star of solid style ; 
From Coney Isle to Zululand, 
From sweet Cohohohoes to Newfoundland, 
Roam where you will a 
man you'll never find 
Like Levi Kassiday. 
CHORUS. 
For he's a 
man, understan, wid a 
very fine eye for a 
nice 
young girl, 
And a 
primo judge of Dublin wine, 
And creamy cream of the style, do you mind, 
Wid a 
rose like his nose, 
Of a 
color as bright as the red blue say, 
Oh, it's on the street, there's few you'll meet 
Like Levi Kassiday. 
A-down the street with stately tread, 
And style that dislocates them all, 
Meanders he, enveloped in 
A 
brand new fresh spring suit of gaul; 
Upon his arm hangs Julia Ann, 
Sweet lady bird of this daisy man, 
A Don Juhannes in his mind is he, 
This Levi Kassiday. 
(Chorus.) 
When voices sweet were handed round, 
Levi was not behind the door, 
An over strung bass voice has he, 
He sang the " mast " in " Pinafore" 
From Asiah to Kalamazu, 
From Canada w 
to San Franciscu, 
Another one of it you'll seldom meet 
Levi Kassday.

Only a 
Sweet Little Letter. 
Published by permission of COLLINS & BUXTON, Portland, Me. 
It is only a 
sweet little letter, 
In my hand that I 
tenderly hold, 
From the one who is dearer and better 
Than the treasure of jewels and gold. 
Many days my poor heart has been sighing 
For this mark of affection to see, 
So then now there is no use denying 
I'm as happy as happy can be, 
CHORUS. 
It is only a 
sweet little letter, 
Whose glad coming I've waited to see, 
Yes, a 
dear little, sweet little letter, 
Just a 
sweet little letter for me. 
6 
It is only a 
sweet little letter, 
But its pages are fill'd with kind words, 
Whose affection is dearer, yes better, 
Than sweet music or carols of birds. 
Oh, they waken glad mem'ries to cheer me, 
As I 
wander afar on life's sea, 
While the sweetest of thoughts linger near me, 
I'm as happy as happy can be. 
It is only a 
sweet little letter, &c. 
It is only a 
sweet little letter, 
But it tells of a 
heart that is true, 
Of a 
love that grows brighter and better 
As the days fade away from my view. 
Yes, it breathes of the fondest devotion, 
That will cling now and ever to me, 
And my heart in its tend'rest emotion, 
I'm as happy as happy can be. 
It is only a 
sweet little letter, &c.

Where Was Mickey When The 
Gas Went Out? 
Written and sung by HARRY CLARK, Irish and-Character Vocalist. 
My name is Michael Dugan, I 
live down in Water street, 
I'm bothered by the boys all round, who call me Mike 
the beat, 
If I 
go to get a 
glass of grog they're sure to follow me in, 
I 
try to drink, the gas goes out, and then they steal my 
gin, and then they all holler— 
enonus. 
Where was Mickey when the gas went out ? 
Where was Mickey, what was he about ? 
If we had him here we'd stuff him full of bees, 
Where was Mickey when the gas went out ? 
I 
went and I 
got married, sure I 
thought I 
would be all 
right, 
The bovs would bother me no more, I'd keep out of their 
sight, 
But I 
was going down street next day when the gang 
snatched me like mad, 
I 
had to fill them up with booze they felt so very glad. 
(Chorus.) 
I\Tow I 
have got four fine big boys, they look just like 
their daddy, 
There's John and James and little Mike, of course there's 
one named Paddy, 
Now Paddy is the smartest boy the neighbors ever seen, 
And when they ask him anything they find he isn't green. 
CHORUS. 
Where was Paddy when the gas went out ? 
Where was Paddy, what was he about, 
If he wasn't there he wasn't anywhere, 
Where was Paddy when the gas went out ?

Parody on Little Widow Dunn. 
Written by BONNIE RUNNELLS, and sung 
by the friend of the working man, 
H ON. JOHN REILLY, who stands without fear whenever he does appear. 
I've got a 
crazy daughter, she's foolish in her head ; 
She never minds me in anything I 
say. 
She's always reading song books, never goes to bed, 
For her schooling every month I 
have to pay. 
She's stuck on the profession—on actors she is mashed— 
She's crazy for to work in Harry Hill's. 
She has challenged Murphy and Rowell to win O'Leary's belt, 
She is the laughing stock for all the gills. 
CHORUS. 
Eileen banana, sweet Louisiana, 
Slobbery days, baby mine. 
Flaherty's frisky from drinking whiskey, 
What an education has Miss Rubenstein. 
I 
sent her to the country to benefit her health, 
For the people on our block are mighty glad. 
Ever since she's been away she's never been herself, 
And the folks they say she's raving staving mad. 
She walks the streets barefooted, wears her sister's clothes, 
Rings the door bells on our block each day; 
She's milking all the chickens, feeding corn to cows, 
And scares the people when they hear her say— 
Eileen banana, &c.

America the Land of the Free! 
Written and sung by Mn. Tom HAMPER. 
Respectfully dedicated to the Veterans of the f9th New York 
Regiment Volunteers. 
Oh! I've lately come from America, the land of the brave 
and free ! 
Where peace and plenty now does reign ; 
And an Irishman, there, is as good as any one, 
Although he may be a 
little green. 
When first I 
crossed the water and landed on their shore, 
They extended then, to me, a 
welcome hand; 
And they said, you're welcome here, your country to us is 
dear, 
And we love you, the Irishman. 
CHORUS. 
Then hurrah for America, the land of the free! 
Sure that's the place, my boys, where there is no 
slavery. 
Oh! I 
had not been there very long when a 
war broke out, 
And spread its desolation over the land; 
When they called upon the Irishman to help go and fight, 
I 
gave to them, then, a 
helping hand ; 
I 
enlisted in the ranks with mans- a 
noble man, 
Along with brave Corcoran and his noble crew! 
And they marched us clown South to what they call Dixie's 
land, 
To fight for the Red, White and Blue! 
Then hurrah for America, Sic. 
There is a 
nation that's been trying to cause America 
trouble. 
Of course, I 
mean the country called Spain ! 
But she'd better mind her business or she soon will see, 
What is her loss will be America's gain; 
For with Cuba annexed unto the United States, 
We'll add to their banner another star ; 
And I 
hope that Ireland soon will, like America be free! 
And you bet, the time is not so very far. 
Then hurrah for America, & c.

The Barnum Show. 
Written by JAS. RICHMOND expressly for the SPARKS BROTHERS 
We are a 
couple of North of Ireland mick-

We are on the tight rope and slack wire ; 
We traveled with Barnum for eleven years 
As Signor Duffy and Mons. McGuire. 
We can throw double somersaults on our neck. 
Three lmndred flip- flaps we can throw, 
We used to cat cannon balls for our dinner, 
When we traveled with the Barnum Show. 
CHORUS. 
We done a 
statue clog with the fat woman once, 
Killed a 
lion with a 
blow ; 
We used to hide from the sheriff in the elephant's trunk. 
When we traveled with the Barnum Show. 
We done a 
highland fling on a 
horizontal bar, 
We learned all the monkeys to play the cornet ; 
We slept in the cage along with the animals, 
When it rained we got soking wet. 
It was us that painted the tattooed Greek, 
And we'd have von all to know 
We were the greatest curiosity out, 
When we traveled with the Barnum Show. 
We done a 
statue clog, &c.

Some for most unpleasant dogs;

And wouldn't give a

For life, without a

Of snow-white cuff and collar.

You can tell me by my collar; 
Captain Cuff, Captain Cuff, 
Though I'm not worth one half dollar ; 
I'm awfully stiff in style, 
My cigarette I'll puff; 
Then hi I 
hi I 
clear the way, 
Here comes Captain Cuff. 
Sometimes a 
common fellow 
Of the lower order class, 
Will dare make some rude remark, 
Or mock me when I 
pass. 
And lots of vulgar little boys, 
They know me well enough, 
And oft salute me as I 
pass, 
With what cheer, Captain Cuff. 
Captain Cuff, etc. 
With darling eyes upon me, 
Through life I 
gaily march. 
My style shall be the stiffest; 
My motto shall be starch. 
Should my cuff and collar glory, 
Be ever gone and fled, 
You'll know that Captain Cuff's gone wrong, 
Aud his washerwoman's dead.

I

Down the dear old shady lane ; 
Tho' the birds and bees are humming, 
Yet my heart is filled with pain: 
For I 
know that I 
will miss you, 
Something softly tells me so; 
So I'm coming, just to kiss you 
Once again before you go. 
CHORUS. 
I 
am coming, for I'll miss you, 
When you wander to and fro; 
I 
am coming, just to kiss you, 
Once again before you go. 
I.am coming, for to-morrow, 
You'll be wandering afar, 
And the thought brings pain and sorrow, 
Since I've learned how dear you are; 
Smiles of thine no more may cheer me, 
But in mem'ry sweet and low, 
Tho'ts of thee will linger near me, 
As you wander to and fro. 
I 
am coming, (Le.

All the days shall smile with gladness, 
When our hearts united be.

I

To a 
nice little surprise party, 
And the charmer that I 
met there was 
The darling, Biddy McCarthy. 
Now Biddy was the finest girl, 
And the amusement of the party, 
Says I, I'm surely dead in love 
With the darling, Biddy McCarthy. 
CHORUS. 
With me tra-la-lee, now don't you see, 
I'm gone on Biddy McCarthy. 
(Repeat.) 
We danced the polka " mazourka," 
Likewise the dizzy lanciers, 
And as we moved around the floor 
We were two darling dancers. 
Says Biddy, sure I 
feel afraid 
That I'll have to shake the party, 
I 
says wait awhile until I 
smile, 
And I'll go home with you Biddy McCarthy. 
(Chortt8.1 
As I 
went home to Biddy's house 
A 
laughing, talking, chatting, 
I 
met her father at the door 
All out of breath a 
panting. 
Says he, now Biddy where did you get this, 
Did you get him at the party, 
Oh, yes, you honor was the reply 
From darling Biddy McCarthy. 
I 
am happy now, I 
have a 
cow, 
Likewise a 
pig and a 
daughter, 
I 
live in a 
cot in a 
shady spot 
Away across the water. 
My mother-in-law she calls on me, 
She is a 
roaring tartar,

bull, 
But I 
love my Biddy McCarthy.

'Twas early in the month of May, I 
said to my girl Lou: 
Now as I 
am going away, I 
want to ask if you 
Will constant be while I'm at sea ?' 
She bowed her lovely head, 
And placed her little hand in mine, 
And this is what she said : 
CHORUS. 
" 
Good bye, good bye, lovely Lou, 
Think of me when I'm at sea, 
And I 
will think of you." 
She said, " To you I 
will be true, 
To do the same I 
ought, 
But I'm told you sailors have 
A wife in every port." 
Says I, " Now Lou, don't look so blue, 
Or deem me so unkind, 
I 
never could forget the girl, 
That I 
would leave behind." 
I 
bade adieu to lovely Lou, 
We parted from the shore, 
But something seemed to tell me, 
Tuat I 
never should see her more. 
When I 
returned I 
quickly learned, 
That she had gone away, 
So now, as Lou has proved urtrue, 
Why, I 
can only say, 
song and dance, as performed by Tom HARPER, the original one-legged 
skater, and song and dance artist. 
My love's a 
little blue-eyed girl, 
Who lives not far from here, 
The first time that I 
met her, ' twas 
In early spring last year. 
I 
was rambling through the meadows, 
Down by a 
silvery st ream, 
And there I 
first met Nellie dear, 
She is my love's young dream. 
Cnonts. 
I 
love her to distraction. 
Such a 
charming way she's got, 
She is my darling little girl, 
My sweet, forget me not. ' 
We chatted on together, 
And I 
helped her o'er it stile, 
She smiled so sweetly on me, 
We traveled for many a 
mile. 
At length the stars shone out no Molt, 
And the village clock struck nine, 
'Twits then I 
asked her for her hand, 
And called tier .Nellin mine. 
Dancing at a

What a 
pleasure there is dancing at a 
raffle, 
On a 
Saturday night when the gas shines bright, 
When all the girls are tickled to death with laughing, 
You will find us blazing tight. 
At every hop and every ball we always swipe a 
check, 
And our opinion now we'll tell—a 
raffle sweeps the deck. 
CHORUS. 
(Chorus). 
What a 
pleasure there is dancing at a 
raffle, 
For an alarm sewing machine or an eight-day stove 
Oh that's the time the girls will give you taffy--
That is the sport we love. 
Shake, shake, thirty-six is high ! ( Break.) 
Pass around the lemonade, the ladies they are dry. ( Break.) 
(Repeat first four lines.) 
What a 
pleasure there is dancing at a 
raffle, 
For a 
double-barreled watch or an eight-day goat, 
That's where you will see us do our double shuffle, 
With our piccadilly flyaway coat. 
With our Cony Island sluggers we always cut a 
dash, 
And all;the girls wherever we go they use us for a 
mash. 
What a 
pleasure there is, &c. 
Written by JOSEPH SPARKS of SPARKS BROTHERS, and sung by him in 
their original sketch, 
The Galway Lawyers." 
The serio-comics' held a 
convention and scraped thirty dollars 
together, 
They resolved to give a 
first-class 
ball, providing it was 
rainy weather. 
They hired a 
Chinese band that came direct from Kalamazoo, 
They charged three cents to put away your hat, and sprin-
kled the floor with glue. 
The song- and-dance men came in dozens, with their uncles 
and their aunts, 
It looked like if some one was pulling the string, you'd grow 
fat to see them dance, oh ! 
Powder, paint and wigs were plenty, the song- and-dance men 
gave the serio-comics' a 
stall— 
Said they never had so much fun since they had the measles, 
at the serio-comics' ball. 
Little Maggie Shotgun throws flips and backs in tights, 
She sang five verses of a 
clog, Mary Clothesline put out the 
lights. 
Then there was a 
terrible fight, Maggie slugged Pedro awful 
gall; 
It was as good as going in swimming on Christmas, at the 
serio-comics' ball. 
You had ought to see the fun when they were shaking dice 
for supper, 
Some had on porous plasters and ulsters, and were walking on 
their uppers. 
They offered an elegant prize to the best dancer on her toes ; 
She danced eleven seconds and danced so long they all 
thought that she was froze. 
Mary Hard-luck the spzeler, and Erastus James O'Brien, 
Ate forty pies and eighty hams and sixty bottles of wine. 
The proprietor kicked for hall rent, then he put them out of 
the hall, 
The police have taken measures to prevent another serio-
comic ball. 
Little Maggie Shotgun, Szc, 
Composed and sung with great success by Andy Collura. 
My grandfather's nose was as red as a 
beet, 
And he• used to hang around in the yard, 
G-et chuck tuil of gin around to Patsey Flynn's, 
With the gang he was always playing cards, 
They stuck him every game and they called for the same, 
So the old guy got chuck full of booze, 
They would lay him on the chairs, stick feathers in his ears, 
While the old bum was taking a 
snooze. 
CHORUS. 
Thirty years he's been living on gin, gin, gin, gin, 
The neighbors around the corner say it's a 
d— 
sin,sin,sin,sin, 
But he stopped, quick, never to get drunk again, 
When his mother-in-law fired him out the door. 
My grandfather's watch was too large for his pockets. 
So he used to hang it up on the wall, 
'Whenever he got broke of course he would go, 
And give Uncle Simpson a 
call, 
He would ask five or ten, or whetever they would lend, 
To the rum shop he would steer right away, 
Get full as a 
brick, next morning he was sick, 
While the super in the pawn shop it did lay, 
CHORUS. 
Thirty days he's been lunching around on beans, beans, 
beans, beans, 
The bartender bit him with a 
screen, screen, screen, screen, 
But he dropped, quick, never to lunch again, 
-When the bar tender stood him on his ear.

I 
MET HER IN THE FALL. 
GIVE THE WORKINGMAN A 
CHANCE, 
As originally sung by W ILL II. 
MORTON, at Howard Atheneum, 
Boston, Mass. 
Some boast of wealth and riches, but give me the hardy hand, 
Give me the honest workingman, the pride of every land; 
The man that earns his living by the sweat of labor's brow, 
That wields the axe, the pick, the spade, or stands behind the 
plough. 
I 
lovo the sons of manly toil, they built up our success, 
And made a 
mighty nation of this western wilderness; 
Unto our bright protecting stars they nobly did advance, 
For well they knew our flag would give each workingman a 
chance. 
They spanned the mighty prairie, they enriched the American 
soil, 
They built each railroad in the land, these sons of hardy toil; 
In vain did other climes compete, our vessels swept the sea, 
For labor was our bond or strength, bright labor, strong and 
free. 
I 
envy not the titled lord, nor yet the man of wealth, 
I'd rather have the sinews strong, that tinge of ruddy health, 
That labor gives to all her sons whose watchword is advance, 
What made our great success—we gave our workingman a 
chance. 
Let England send her hardy sons, to them we'll give the hand, 
We can't forget that Washington sprang from the mother:and, 
Let Germany her thousands send, to leave their sunny Rhine, 
And Russia, from her icy plains, in countless thousands join. 
Let Ireland send each manly form, no tyrant here does stand, 
A welcome sweet we'll give to all in our bright Western land, 
Come from the home of Lafaette—the sunlit hills of France, 
For ' tis our greatest joy to give each workingman a 
chance.

The sweetest of them all. 
I'd tell her name, but I 
dare nct, 
I 
met her in the fall, 
She looked at me, I 
looked at her, 
She blushed and hung her head. 
My heart it beat with rapture, 
I 
thought that I 
was dead. 
CHORUS. 
She's beantiful, 
She's fairer than them all. (Syns.)

THE OLD VILLAGE SCHOOL ON THE 
GREEN. 
Written by FRANK VAN HESS for ED. BURTON, and sung by him 
with great success. 
Oh! I 
love the bright days of my youth to review, 
And fancy again I'm a 
boy, 
With my merry companions so faithful and true, 
And friendship that knows no alloy. 
Oh! the thoughts I 
review as I 
ponder the past, 
Recalling each dear youthful scene; 
The one I 
most prize, and will love to the last, 
Is the old village school on the green. 
(Repeat two last lines.) 
Near the old village school the cottage still stands, 
Where I 
first saw the dawn of light; 
And nnw over its porch in rich clustering bands, 
The roses are blooming as bright 
As ' twas when with garlands and wreaths of wild flowers, 
We joyously crowned our May Queen, 
And tOld childish love tales in neat little bowers, 
Near the old village school on the green. 
(Repeat two last lines.) 
I 
have left many dear and some loved ones behind 
To rest as I've journeyed along; 
There are others remain just as faithful and kind, 
To join in the laugh and the song; 
And when I 
am ca led by grim death to prepare, 
I 
will answer with spirit serene, 
they'lllay me to rest when I 
breathe my last prayer, 
tear the old village school on the green.

Oh, ladies and gentlemen, I 
now tell to ye 
About a 
young man named Oscar Magee; 
He had cast-iron teeth, and he never eat hash, 
When his money was all spent he had to pawn his moustache. 
He had a 
brother named DeWitt, in Brooklyn he did preach, 
He married old Corbin down at Manhattan Beach; 
He married them in a 
cellar, he must have been in a 
trance, 
The wedding present was a 
cast-iron overcoat and a 
wooden 
pair of pants. 
He bought a 
gold mine in Hoboken, and he found nothing 
but rocks; 
He went crazy and mad and cut his throat—with a 
pair 
of socks. 
He was found guilty of arson and stealing twenty gold rings, 
Then he was taken 
to a 
coal yard, and hung by the 
shoe strings.

Did ye's ever go in 'till an Irishman's shanty ? 
Och! b'ys that's the place where the whiskey is plenty • 
With his pipe in his mouth there sits Paddy so free. 
No King in his place is prouder than he! 
CHORUS. 
There's a 
three-legged stool, with a 
table to match 
And the door of the shanty is locked with a

For want of a

Arrah! me honey, &c,

There's a

He has pigs in the sty, and a

Arrah! me honey, &c. 
He can relish good victuals as ever ye's ate,

He prefers them when cawld (if he can't get them hot), 
And makes tay in a 
bowl when he can't get a

Arrah! me honey, &c. 
There is one who partakes of his sorrows and joys, 
Attends to the shanty, the girls and the boys;

But Biddy's the jewel that's set in his mind. 
Arrah! me honey, &c.

With those who have riches as great as their own;

And will share his last cent with the needy and poor.

What a 
pleasure it is flirting in the moonlight, 
On a 
sweet summer's eve in June, 
When the pretty little stars they shine so bright, 
In their dance around the glittering moon. 
1,Ve pass the happy hours away, 
Where the music sounds so clear, 
Feeling happy, light and gay, 
As we smile on the fellows dear. 
What a 
pleasure it is flirting in the moonlight, 
On a 
sweet summer's eve in June, 
When the pretty little stars they shine so bright, 
In their dance around the glittering moon.

Oh, my, how happy we do be! ( Sym.) 
Yes, yes. full of mirthful glee! (Sym.) 
What a

On a

When the pretty little stars they shine so bright, 
In their dance around the glittering moon. 
Now the pleasures of flirting in the moonlight 
To you I 
could not tell; 
And making love with some one at the first sight, 
Down in a 
fairy dell. 
With our fans held close up to our eyes, 
We watch for the passing swells, 
And look abashed at the moving skies 
Down where the floweret dwells. 
Now the pleasures of flirting in the moonlight 
To you I 
could not tell; 
And making love to some one at the first sight, 
Down where the flowerets dwell.

On the banks of the river Ohio, 
In a 
quiet flowing glade, 
Where the soft and gentle river flows 
In sunshine and in shade; 
It was there I 
saw a 
maiden fair, 
Eyes jet and breast like snow, 
And in meeting her has caused me great despair— 
Down by the Ohio. 
Beneath the trees she lay reclining ( Break.) 
Her two bright eyes like stars were shining (Break.) 
CHORUS. 
And as I 
gazed upon her form, 
I 
lost my heart, you know; 
I 
won't forget the girl I 
met 
Down by the Ohio. 
I 
took courage to kiss her little hand, 
When she started like a 
fawn, 
And blushed like the rose of early morn 
That spreads all o'er the dawn. 
I 
said a,nd would she be mine, 
She slowly answered, " No," 
And left me standing all alone 
Down by the Ohio.

" 
The mill will never grind again 
-With the water that has past." 
A 
maxim DI the olden time 
That will forever last. 
'This theme, in verses written, 
Preaches a 
sermon to all ; 
But critically weighed with wisdom, 
How does the lesson fall ? 
The m111 upon a 
slope cloth stand, 
It bears an antique shape; 
Waters from the mountain-land 
Seem happy to escape, 
And, rushing by the old mill's wheel, 
Causing it to grind. 
Bound madly on the vale beyond, 
A 
level there to find. 
The race now o'er, with calmness 
Into a 
lake the water flows, 
And, mingling with the tranquil flood, 
Seeks peace in sweet repose. 
The bright sunbeams then visiting 
This realm to Somnus given, 
The tiny globes in vapors rise 
To space above in heaven. 
Once in air, they congregate, 
Fantastic clouds to be, 
And, wafted by the summer breeze, 
Float off most gracefully. 
Soon the mountain tops are reached, 
Ere they cling for rest; 
Each rugged peak is hid from view, 
Each in vapor dressed. 
At morn the clouds would fain ascend, 
And leave this dreary plain; 
But, chilled through by the frigid air, 
Condensed, they fall in rain. 
As the pearly drops alight, 
They dance about with glee, 
For are they not of earth again, 
Just as they used to be? 
They prance, they skip, and race along, 
O'er pebbled brook and rill— 
When lo ! they reach familiar ground, 
And pass the same old mill. 
In doing so they turn the wheel, 
With sparkling spray o'ercast, 
Thus proving that the mill does grind 
With water that has past. 
Philosophically the lesson's taught, 
Bidding us beware, 
Although a 
chance unheeded pass, 
Not to incite despair. 
Labor on with redoubled zeal, 
Lost hours to redeem, 
And teacn your conscience thus to feel, 
That things are what they seem. 
Opportunities appearing lost, 
And numbered with the slain, 
By providential agencies 
Will surely come again. 
Now bear in mind, although the Fates 
Your hopes continually blast, 
Kind Nature's mill will grind again 
With watet that has past,

Here I 
am, an Irish lad, that you can plainly see, 
I've traveled this world o'er and o'er, till I

From Dublin Bay I 
came away, I 
never fret or sigh, 
For I'm always gay, both night and day, this son of Erin's Isle.

Yes, I 
am an Irish ranting blade, and that I 
never deny, 
And I'll give you all a 
chance tor to see the way I 
dance, 
As they do in Erin's Isle. (Repeat.) 
The other day I 
went astray, I 
never shall forget, 
When a 
pretty little Irish girl oh I 
by chance had met. 
She showed me home, that I 
will own, and this was her reply: 
" 
You I 
do adore, and there is something more, you're a 
son 
of Erin's Isle." 
Yes, I 
am, &c. 
For to return home once more my mind is fully bent, 
And when I 
arrive on the shamrock shore, won't there be a 
grand event. 
My friends and my relations will greetme with all smiles, 
To welcome home one of their own, a 
son of Erin's Isle.

Was Charles Frederick Horace O'Brien. 
Last summer he beat his boarding house, 
And skipped to a

At Charles Frederick Horace O'Brien.

He left and sailed for Europe, 
Where he calls himself Prince. 
To the Queen of Dublin he made love, 
Said his money was counted in mints;

That the Duchess of Italy gave ten years to

The Clam Merchant. 
Written by ED. SANDS, of KEATING and SANDS. 
Come all my jovial pardiners, and listen to my rhymes, 
While I 
will tell unto you all a 
story of the times. 
'Tis of a 
gallant clam seller, who many a 
clam had dug, 
Until he saved enough of cash to make himself quite snug. 
One day, as he was peddling his clams along the streets, 
A 
young and tender maiden he chanced him for to meet. 
She bent upon him one sweet glance as he his wares did cry, 
Which made his heart to palpitate, and hove a 
heavy sigh. 
This clam man he did look on her, and she did look on him; 
He gazed until his google eyes grew weak and likewise dim. 
Then up he spoke and says to her all in a 
clamerous voice: 
"Oh maiden, that ' ere look of yourn has made my heart rejoice." 
Now she was one of them ' ere kind that knew a 
thing or two; 
She did see at one fell swoop what he did mean to do. 
So she replied unto his words, " I'm but an orphan child, 
Brought up in the Home for Wanderers, which makes me 
meek and mild." 
At this the noble clam man he did mark her for his own, 
And kindly he invited her to make his house her own. 
With tears a 
streaming down her cheeks, she said she did 
not mind; 
Then he jumps in his cart, while she jumps on behind. 
Now she was one of that ' ere sort what knew a 
thing or two; 
She did see at one fell swoop what he did mean fo do. 
55 
THE CLAM MERCHANT. 
Continued. 
So she replied unto his words, •" I'm but an orphan child, 
Brought up in the Home for Wanderers, which makes me 
meek and mild." 
Now listen to me, pardiners, while I 
a 
story tell 
Of all the sad disasters which this clain:.s!I man befell. 
Which, .while lie gave her lager beer, and thought her safe 
at rest, 
She was going through his trunks, and doing her level best. 
Oh, while he thought to wreak her ruin, be dosed her bitter 
beer, 
She deftly threw it on the floor, which to him it did not appear. 
Then into his tumbler she poured a 
powder vile, 
And thus preserved the virtuousness of this little orphan child. 
Now, my dear pardners, when next the clam man woke, 
He gazed unto his horror that he was then dead broke. 
He seized his cherished oyster-knife; and drove it into his 
whizzen, 
And now the life that once was his it it ain't no longer his'n. 
This meek and lowly orphan girl by this one stroke of her'n, 
Did come into affluence, for which she long did yearn. 
And now, dear pardners, she lives in Aenue Five, 
Having made an ample fortune by selling clams alive. 
Now, all my roving libertines, take warning by me here, 
Whenever you dose a 
girl's beverage, be sure she drinks 
the beer ; 
Or else, like this ' ere clam man, you will pick up things 
that's mild, 
Just like this female wanderer, this little orphan child. 
As sung by TONY PASTOR, with immense success. 
Air: "Castle in the Air." 
Mr. Talmage late to New York came to see each wondrous 
sight, 
To find out if the world went wrong, and make the matter 
right; 
He visited each curious place where " Life" did find a 
home, 
In fact he had a 
midnight spree as he this town did roam; 
I 
do not wish much fault to find, of him to make complaint, 
But think at home by his fireside would have been better for 
a " Saint !" 
No doubt he saw many things of the easy kind and free, 
But some misery he could help to cure, he had not eyes to see. 
He did not see our working girls as the snow was falling fast, 
Creep home to attic, cramped and small, thro' the chilly 
wintry blast ; 
Her wretched home of poverty is roofless o'er hcr 
Her heart is bleak and cold and sad 
her meal a 
crust of 
bread. 
He did not see the twinkling stars shine down from the blue 
sky, 
Upon her upturned face of woe as she lay there to die; 
Heard not her suffering cry " 
help !" as her soul trom 
bondage free; 
Sped swiftly , to the unknown shore! THAT Talmage did not 
see. 
WHAT TALMAGE DID NOT SEE, 
He did not see our laboring men in life's sad battle beat, 
Working from daylight until dark that food their wives might 
eat ; 
He did not see dark hunger's cloud grow denser every day, 
Nor capital, with iron hand, drag down each workman's 
pay; 
He did not see each savings bank our poor, hard earnings 
win, 
He went where luxury abounds in the halls of gilded sin; 
The outcasts of the gutter, he in scorn did let them be, 
No hand he them reached out to save, such sights he did not 
see. 
have often pondered in my mind, he had better go to 
woik, 
And purify his own good town before he tries New York; 
I 
never thought that Brooklyn was the long sought " promised 
land," 
Or even that its parsons were the famous Gideon's band. 
I 
hope before he next starts out in search of sin to roam, 
He'll use his purifying broom, and sweep much nearer 
home; 
Or if he must keep on his course and will not let us be, 
He'll give a 
dime and not a 
tract when -
..-
aisery he does see.

Will the summer zephyr kiss us 
When we wander down the lane ?

In the golden pastures bright, 
And since then, my little darling. 
Time has quickly taken flight.

And I 
hope, my little darling, 
There we'll meet to never part.

The N. Y. Evening Mail writese 
" 
A 
Little Book has lately appeared in print at Mr. A. J. FISHER'S, 98 has 
sau street, called the " Little Flirt." We 
cannot say that we recommend 
it to our young lady and gentlemen readers, as we think it would only 
encourage the bad habit of " flirting,." Unfortunately, there is enough 
of it done without any further necessity of explaining 
how, when and 
where to do it," and this little volume would advise and initiv the un-
corrupted in practicing what is commonly called "flirting." 
The N. Y. Evening Telegram writes: " We have lately seen a 
neat Witte 
book, bound in -Morocco leather, costing twenty-five cents, called the 
"Little Flirt," published by A. J. FISHER, No. 98 Nassau Street. 
It 
gives information of the modus operandi of flirting, and of the mean-
ing of every motion of the handkerchief, fan, glove and parasol. As 
there is nothing at all objectionable in the volume, and its contents 
might afford some innocent amusement to many, we do not hesktate to 
recommend it to our young lady and gentlemen readers ."

7ortune-Telling Cards.—This is the .old-
est and most widely known pack of Fortune-Telling Cards. We have 
published it for years, and the demand is continually increasing. 
These Cards are arranged and printed in series—Hearts, Clubs, Dia-
monds and Spades—and each of these into K for King, Q for Queen, 
ad K 
for Knave, and numbers 1, 3, to 10. 
The Cards are arranged in 
four rows, and are to be read according to directions. 
Many of the an-
swers depend upon the position certain cards bear to other cards. The, 
method of playing is somewhat complicated, but the directions have 
been made so that very little study will suffice to an ordinary under-
standing. 
Many professional Fortune-Tellers use these cards, and we 
are in receipt of letters in relation to them from all parts of the U. S. 
Enclosed in handsome case

Courtin Cards.—This Series of Cards has been arranged 
to meet a 
want frequently felt by young people—a 
want of means of 
expressing one's sentiments in such s 
way as to be non-cosnmittal. 
Many young ladies are visited by :stletnen who are either too diffi-
dent or too fearful of a 
repulse, to venture upon asking the momentous 
question. 
The lady is restrained, by custom and a 
sense of propriety, 
from doing anything that would seem to be an unladylike encourage-
, 
ment. As a 
result of this dilemma, many lives are spent as an unloved 
tedious existence, which inieht have been prolonged and enjoyed in the 
happiness of matrimouy. 
This pack of Cards will overcome the diffi-
culty, and being in the shape of questions and answers, will cover every 
phase of courtship. 
The sentiments conveyed therein need not be 
adopted by the parties to the game as their own, unless it accords with 
the state of their affections, which fact makes a 
further explanation un-
necessary. The playing of these Cards is not restricted to two players, 
but may be enjoyed by evening parties
