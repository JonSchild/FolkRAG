Bold Jack Donahue
BOLD JACK DONAHUE 5103 B
Cotton Davis Shafter, 1940
Come all you jolly highway men and outlaws of the land Whose kind do live in slavery or
wear a convict's brand. Attention pay to what I say and value it if you do While I relate the
natural- a fate of Bold Jack Donahue.
This bold adopted highwayman as you may understand Transported by a natural life from
Ireland's happy land From Dublin down while I reknown his first breath he drew His deeds
of honor entitle him to Bold Jack Donahue.
When he effected his escape to rob he went straightway The people were afraid of him to
travel night or day For every day in the newspapers they were reading of something new
Concerning this bold highwayman called Bold Jack Donahue.
Will Wright, McClellan, Bill Collins and also Winselow These were the four associates of
Bold Jack Donahue.
Bold Donahue and his comrades rode out one afternoon Not thinking of the hands of death
that may o'er sail them soon But acurst police to their surprise they quickly rode in view
And in quick turn they did advance to take Bold Donahue.
Bold Donahue to his comrades: if you prove true to me Be willing, be bold, be upright, be
legally firm and true This day we'll gain our liberty said bold Jack Donahue.

Oh no, said cowardly Winselow to that we won't agree For you see there are l5 of them
and it's best for us to flee For if we stay we'll lose the day and battle we will rue Be gone
from me you cowardly dog said Bold Jack Donahue.
The sergent unto Donahue: what do you carobine Will you attempt to fight us or unto us
resign To surrender to such cowardly dogs is something I never would do I'll fight this day
until I die said Bold Jack Donahue.
BOLD JACK DONAHUE
The sergeant and the corporal their men they did divide While some rode in behind him
and others at his side The sergeant fired at him and the people fired too
Nine men he forced to bite the dust before the fatal ball Had pierced the heart of Donahue
which caused him for to fall And when he closed his trembling eyes he bid this world adieu
Dear Christians all pray for the soul of Bold Jack Donahue.
