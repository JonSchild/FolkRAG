A t
alk p
resented at t
he Culture Learning Institute, East-West Center, o
n August
 
2
6, 1
983,
 a
s p
art of the Arts Explorations Series.
 
My r
emarks will be very much off the cuff.  I wasn't e
xpecting to do a
 
formal p
resentation, but t
hat's OK; I
'll wing it.  I thought t
hat you'd like a
 
sketch of the Washington s
cene because i
t's a little more complex than most
 
p
eople r
ealize in this particular area.  There are at least four federal
 
agencies t
hat have directly to do with folk life, folk art, folk culture, folk
 
whatever....to t
he e
xtent that t
hey have had to develop a memorandum of
 
u
nderstanding in o
rder to keep out of each other's turf.  About one year and a
 
half ago, we s
igned an agreement about exactly what such agency involved was
 
going to be doing.  We have been acting a
long that line s
ince.  Then there are
 
about f
ive o
r six agencies that have a
ncillary activities in this line.  The
 
four major ones are:  the Smithsonian Institution, the Library of Congress, t
he
 
N
ational Endowment for t
he Humanities, and the National Endowment for Arts.
 
The N
ational Endowment for t
he Humanities and the National Endowment for
 
t
he Arts are t
he s
implest in that they are granting i
nstitutions and they give
 
grants.  The National Endowment for t
he Arts gives grants to forward projects
 
concerning the folk arts.  The NEH gives grants concerning the s
tudy of folk
 
culture i
n one way o
r another.  Now obviously t
hey cross over; I prefer overlap
 
to u
nderlap.  We do work back and forth between the two agencies in attempting
 
to make s
ure that good projects get the money t
hat's needed.  We consider
 
ourselves p
rivileged to have a n
ice chunk of t
axpayers' dollars.  A lot of nice
 
t
hings are happening with o
ur money.
 
The o
ther two agencies, t
he Smithsonian and the Library of Congress are
 
p
rogrammatic agencies; they produce things, whereas the other two agencies fund
 
other people to do t
hings.  In the Smithsonian Institution there is an office
 
of Folk Life Study t
hat recently has been headed by Ralph Rinzler.  Their basic
 
activities have been to produce a monograph s
eries of research papers.  One of
 
t
heir most r
ecent has been on a particular pottery t
radition in South Georgia;
 
another on a p
ottery t
radition in Korea.  They've gotten a recent publication
 
out on what t
he author told me somewhat embarrassedly more t
han I probably
 
would ever wish to know about the construction of the o
jibwa [
?] drum.  Very,
 
very t
horough.
 
I
n addition to this publication s
eries and the support of s
cholars who are
 
working within that line, you can get a s
cholarship to work at t
he Folk Life
 
Center b
y applying to the Smithsonian.  They a
lso produce t
heir annual Festival
 
of American Folklife.  This is an event t
hat t
akes p
lace on the National Mall
 
r
ight between t
he buildings of the Smithsonian.  It's rather different from
 
most folk festivals i
n that i
t i
s sponsored by a museum, and thus is s
upposed
 
to r
epresent t
he s
tate of the arts, so to s
ay, i
n terms of how to present a
 
living folk t
radition.  Sometimes they succeed; sometimes t
hey don't, but t
hey
 
certainly make an effort.  E
ach festival i
s organized around p
articipation by
 
one country a
nd a
lso one s
tate.  I mention this because t
he s
tate of Hawaii i
s
 
currently being wooed by t
he Smithsonian.  (See, you not only have to put up
 
t
he folks, b
ut you a
lso have to put up the money to p
articipate i
n this thing!)
 
2
 
So e
ach s
tate h
as to be p
ersuaded that it would be to t
heir economic and o
ther
 
advantage to p
articipate i
n t
his.  I
've been s
ent here i
n p
art to bring a
long
 
some information about how n
ifty i
t is to be out on the mall with t
he
 
Smithsonian Festival, which i
t is.  And I can honestly s
ay it i
s a very, very
 
good thing to do.  Last year, t
he participating nation was France and the
 
p
articipating state was New Jersey.  E
veryone was very amused by t
his, b
ut I
'll
 
s
ay t
hat i
t was an e
xcellent year.  A vintage year.
 
Now a
ll four of these agencies have specific problems specifically
 
concerned with s
upport and enhancement of folk activities with t
he exception of
 
t
he Humanities [
NEHJ which i
s set up a little differently....If you want to do
 
an individual r
esearch project, i
t doesn't matter if you're doing one on folk
 
life o
r on Byzantine wall-painting, you go through the research t
radition.  But
 
t
hey do expend a s
erious amount of their budget on projects that one could s
ay
 
have directly to do with folk life and cultural anthropology of one kind or
 
another.
 
The Arts Endowment e
xpends a budget, that I
'm responsible for, s
omewhere
 
between 2
.5 and 3 million dollars per year on such activities.  The Library of
 
Congress budget is approaching a m
illion dollars.  The Smithsonian Institute's
 
budget is a little harder to put a finger on because they bring i
n money i
n
 
order to run t
he festivals and so on, but I
'd say it's in the n
eighborhood of
 
1
.5 to 2 million dollars.
 
This r
epresents a s
erious investment in a topic that I still e
very o
r e i
n
 
a while look around and think "My word".  When I f
irst came along there wasn't
 
anybody who even knew what i
t was, less spend a n
ickel for it.  And on the p
art
 
of the federal government i
t really i
s quite extraordinary, because I haven't
 
e
ven gone t
hrough t
he whole list.  There are t
he National Historic Preservation
 
p
eople who have decided o
ver the past couple of years (with considerable amount
 
of i
nput from a
n American Musicological society, the American Folklore s
ociety,
 
t
he American Anthropological Association), that it is possible that one might
 
wish to preserve more t
han s
imply a s
ingle building somewhere and that t
here
 
might be s
omething to do with t
he quality of life involved in putting through
 
highways and erecting new b
uildings, etc.  And they are talking now about
 
e
xpanding their protection activities to include human s
alvation as well as t
he
 
s
alvation of ancient b
uildings and archealogical s
ites.  And they have
 
commissioned a very large study which has just come up with i
t f
irst s
tate
m e
nt
 
to that effect and, by gums, Secretary Watts recently signed off on it!  That
 
does not mean that he p
ut a
ny money into it, but he agrees with i
t i
n
 
p
rinciple.
 
And a
ll of t
hese agreements are important; they will be statements t
hat you
 
can use later on in justifying and explaining why it is that s
uch and s
uch
 
a
ctivity should be done.  So there has been a great deal of change in the
 
consciousness of the American people, and I think particularly i
n the American
 
federal government i
n the importance of all t
hese kinds of s
lightly bizarre
 
a
ctivities.
 
I mean I
'm s
till running around defining "folk" and all that, a
nd
 
e
xplaining what t
he difference between ethnic art and folk art i
s, and
 
community art, a
nthropology, a
nd folklore, and all that.  I can do a
ll of that
 
for you i
f you want, b
ut i
t's rather t
ime consuming I
'll come back to it if you
 
l
ike, but maybe we should just assume t
hat we know basically what we're t
alking
 
about and move on to some of the questions that I think underlie s
ome of the
 
i
nterest that i
s currently being p
laced in this.
 
I think that a lot of people are a little embarrassed about i
t because i
t
 
doesn't s
eem l
ike we're on the cutting edge of anything; i
n fact, i
t s
eems like
 
we're b
ack there d
igging our heels in and pulling on the r
opes a
nd s
aying "not
 
3
 
s
o f
ast; let's hold off; let's go back to t
he good '
01 days when p
eople s
ang
 
unaccompanied ballads and didn't have a
ll these acrylic paints and f
ancy d
yes,
 
a
nd you had to go out a
nd f
ind your seeweeds and grind them up".
 
And I think contemporary s
tudents, i
n p
articular, f
ind it a little
 
embarrassing not to be among the avante garde.  The role i
s maybe uncomfortable
 
but I think that we are going through a very odd and i
nteresting and exciting
 
period at t
his point which a
ll have to do with the forces of centralization.
 
As I look around t
he United States, I see t
he most conservative agencies
 
t
hinking that t
hey're t
he most radical, and the radical agencies thinking that
 
t
hey're t
he most conservative.  It's a
lmost a complete reversal.  The two parts
 
of our s
ociety t
hat have t
he most deleterious effect on folk art and folklore
 
and folk everything are two parts of our society t
hat we are, I think very
 
correctly, most p
roud of.
 
One i
s our communication system whereby we can let everybody i
n the world
 
know e
verything the s
econd it happens.  We can now communicate instantly masses
 
of i
nformation, and we do.  We spread it out.  The thing that happens when this
 
o
ccurs, the t
echnology requires that the information comes from a more o
r less
 
centralized force.  You pretty well have to put i
t out from somewhere with a
ll
 
of your marvelous technological equipment.  Now it's beginning to spread out
 
and people a
re beginning to realize that there are, as my brother puts it, two
 
p
ositions on an e
lectronic switch.  You can go t
his away o
r you go this away
 
and a
ll you have to do is push the switch.  You don't have to s
et up a whole
 
n
ew wire.  The e
lectronic impulse doesn't care which way it goes, but basically
 
speaking we have centralized most of our information in order to get it out
 
quicker and better and, as a result, more and more of the s
ame i
nformation i
s
 
being fed with t
he s
ame language to everybody i
n a kind of a r
igid format t
hat
 
you have to learn how to r
eceive it in order to process it and i
n order to make
 
u
se of i
t.  A kind of r
igidity i
s coming a
long with a
ll of this wonderful
 
spread of i
nformation.
 
You s
ee t
he s
ame t
hing i
n the s
chools.  We are committed to universal
 
e
ducation.  This is a noble and worthy goal, worthy of a f
ree people and I am
 
very p
roud of being i
n a society that feels that e
verybody should have a
 
minimum education regardless of the condition of their bodies o
r t
heir brains
 
o
r where t
hey l
ive; we are responsible for making sure that e
verybody gets a
 
chance at a good education.  But in order to do t
hat, again centralization
 
requires p
roduction of teaching materials that are then p
assed out t
his way
 
f
rom a central source and again a r
igidity, sameness, across the land, a kind
 
of a dreary s
ameness [
results].
 
And a
long with t
his, i
f you want to get into the s
ameness and information,
 
you better get to t
he center; that's where its coming from.  You better pick up
 
and get to Los Angeles o
r New York or Washington o
r Chicago.  It's not going to
 
do you much good to s
it o
ut on Maui, r
ight?  You can't "
get in" that way.  You
 
just have to s
it o
ut t
here and t
ake it a
ll the t
ime if you're i
n a small town
 
i
n North Dakota.
 
So t
his kind of message has began to pervade not only t
he United States b
ut
 
a
lso t
he world.  And i
t has r
esulted, I think in a kind of state of malaise and
 
psychic distress.  E
veryone knows that they're special and different but
 
t
hey're getting the s
ame message.  Everyone knows that t
heir n
eck of the world
 
i
s special, u
nusual, a
nd i
nteresting; but t
hey're being treated exactly l
ike
 
e
verybody e
lse.  Their k
ids go to s
chool and they have a mama a
nd a p
apa, and a
 
dog and a cat (
even i
f they're i
n Siberia).  You don't have a f
amily unless you
 
h
ave a cat.  You n
eed a grandma you go to s
ee, not one that lives in your
 
house.  A
ll t
hese little t
hings are being drummed into people and their
 
s
amenesses.  I s
incerely believe very much t
hat one of t
he reasons that p
eople
 
1
4
 
a
re very i
nterested now in t
hese little t
raditions t
hat we call folk art a
nd
 
folklore i
s local because t
hey represent a genuine, s
piritually s
trong,
 
definable, r
esistance to being [
the s
ame].  What you come up with is going to
 
h
ave i
ts own distinctiveness that will tell you who you are and from what p
art
 
of the world you come, and f
rom where your people came.  I think its a very
 
s
erious and important i
nterest that people are showing in their own traditional
 
i
dentity.  And it's showing up i
n all sorts of p
laces.
 
Before I move off of this particular topic, I can't resist leaving you with
 
one of the s
entences my brother wrote.  When I read it, I
 will never, never
 
forget it and I will n
ever be quite e
xactly the s
ame again.  He was t
alking
 
about music and t
he fact t
hat certain s
tyles of American music have been
 
smeared around the s
urface of the world with a
ll sorts of para-messages that if
 
you want to be a big time guy and make a lot of money, a
ll you have to do i
s to
 
make enough money to buy a bigger amplifier than the guy next door.  He
 
r
egarded that as a "
cultural gray-out", a grayness of everything.  If it goes
 
on like this, he s
aid, pretty soon all around the world, t
here will be no p
lace
 
left worth visiting and no p
articular reason to stay home.  Really got to me.
 
I really h
ave t
houghts about when I go home, what it ought to be like, what i
t
 
o
ught to feel like, and they're not o
ld-fashioned.  They are in many respect
 
forward-looking i
n the e
xtreme.  I think that t
his is the whole profession that
 
we're i
nventing here.  Nobody i
n t
he world ever t
ried before to keep care of
 
a
ll of the little cultures around the p
lace.  That was n
ever an attempted goal.
 
Nobody e
ver e
ven t
hought about i
t.  We learned very easily, because it was
 
economically a
dvantageous, how to wipe o
ut small local cultures.  First you
 
went i
n and showed them a
ll of your beautiful goods, and if they didn't shape
 
up and s
tart to buy t
hem, t
hen you gave t
hem small pots and eventually it
 
worked out t
hat t
hey didn't have much culture left.  But nobody even thought
 
about i
t much.  How we do t
he opposite is something that is a new
 
c
onsideration.
 
When I f
irst took the job at t
he NEA, I became aware t
hat t
here were not
 
many guideposts to follow, no s
trategies, no p
lan, no t
hought about what would
 
work. Lot of i
n-feeling that maybe we shouldn't do it anyway.  Constantly
 
r
unning i
nto people that s
aid that everybody's got to be modern.  Everyone's
 
got to be up-to-date.  Are you sure you're doing people good???  In the first
 
p
lace, I
 mean, me and even 2
.5 million dollars against a
ll the cultures of the
 
world?? I
'm not going to have any effect
—like a s
tick going i
nto the water
 
down the s
tream.  I
 was s
uddenly given credit for having powers
 
beyond,.. .
shoot...way beyond President Reagan's.  So I gave up worrying whether
 
I
 was doing anybody any harm.
 
But t
he t
hought of what to do, e
ven assuming we could agree on what ought
 
to be done, has given me a very happy life for t
he past f
ive years.  I
've had a
 
wonderful t
ime t
rying to t
hink about t
his, and talking to other people [
who
 
are] thinking about i
t, too.  There's a lot more t
han the little '
ol Folk Arts
 
P
rogram a
t t
he NEA; but i
n a funny way I do t
hink that t
he Folk Arts Program,
 
b
y v
irtue of pure accident, i
s in one of the best p
laces because we are dealing
 
with art. And I do feel that people's s
ymbol s
ystems are p
art of the emotional,
 
i
ntellectual, s
piritual baggage that can be brought a
long through a
ll kinds of
 
major shifts i
n economic and geographic location.  All kinds of things can be
 
d
isrupted here and there, b
ut that philosophic outlook, that general s
ense of
 
where people are p
laced i
n the world that is expressed through art, I think
 
r
etains its i
ntegrity o
ver a long period of t
ime, and it's appropriate for i
t
 
to retain its i
ntegrity.  People feel good about t
hat.
 
People might not feel good about my s
aying (
which I would never say) that
 
t
hey shouldn't come to Los Angeles, t
hey s
hould go back home a
nd l
ive on the
 
5
 
f
arm.  I
 would get a lot of p
eople getting annoyed about t
hat.  But I can s
ay
 
i
f you come to Los Angeles, "Enjoy [
the music of your area], don't forget it.
 
You'll s
till f
ind it as wonderful, and other people will l
ike it.  You might
 
e
ven want to have a little s
ession in the local library where you give a
 
concert of the music f
rom where you come.  You would enjoy that.  A spiritually
 
good exercise for e
verybody concerned."  That's not threatening.  That s
ays
 
"Take your philosophy, your f
inest works of your human spirit with you and
 
t
reasure t
hem." Just as many of us have o
ver long periods of t
ime round the
 
world.  So, t
his is kind of why we're doing what we're doing.  These are s
ome
 
of the i
deas that circulate around t
he Washington area.
 
And I can now get down to a little bit more basics of how we're sort of
 
doing i
t.  It's not an e
xact s
cience.  And I would prefer, if you don't mind,
 
to t
alk about t
he Folk Arts Program, simply because I know it better.  I can
 
answer questions concerning the other programs, but I would hesitate to s
ay
 
"
this is the outlook of the Smithsonian o
r t
he Humanities", because for a
ll I
 
know they're thinking a
long new lines that I haven't heard about.
 
In terms of Folk Arts i
t is continuing a number of strategies that we
 
devised a long time ago and we've added a few on to it.  We give out basically
 
matching grants to groups, r
ather than to individuals.  Because we have felt
 
very much that Folk Arts are not very expensive.  They very often do not come
 
a
long with a huge panaply of production costs or permanent organizations or
 
whatever. We have been concerned that putting federal money in might distort
 
t
he relationship of the t
radition to the group of people that are doing i
t; a
nd
 
so we a
lways are able to get in and get out.  We will fund a group to put on a
 
festival and maybe for a couple of years and then maybe they ought to begin to
 
do it t
hemselves.  Or e
lse maybe they're just doing it to get the government
 
money which i
s not what we hope will happen.  So we tend to be a little
 
cautious, a little conservative and try to make sure that t
he group involved
 
really wants to do it.  Then it is something that they are really concerned
 
with, and that i
ts not just something that t
hey think is going to get some
 
people some money.
 
We fund projects to present the folk arts all the way f
rom e
xhibits to
 
festivals to concert s
eries--whatever.  We fund projects to document the folk
 
arts and to present t
hem v
ia t
he documentations.  We don't, for i
nstance, f
und
 
somebody to go and do a photographic survey of every chipji basket in the
 
so-and-so peninsula to be t
aken back to be put on a computer and analyzed for
 
t
he whatever comes out of such an analysis.  That would go to Humanities.  We
 
might fund, however, a f
ilm on chipji [
?] basket-making i
n which a good chunk
 
of the money went back to the basket-makers and in which we got, from t
he
 
beginning, e
vidence t
hat t
he film would be shown in the s
chools and would be
 
shown on local television.  So it's a s
lightly different approach.
 
We do do documentation; we are i
nterested, however, i
n the documentation
 
getting back and being immediately a
ccessible to the people whose art i
s being
 
documented.
 
That i
ncludes, b
y t
he way, the production of phonograph recordings and we
 
are beginning to switch more and more to the production of tapes, because
 
c
assette t
apes of some of the early historic recordings form t
he northern
 
C
alifornia t
ribes t
hat have been s
itting around and we are getting them back i
n
 
form to be used i
n local t
ribal centers and also on regular local programs.
 
We're t
rying to contact t
he descendants of a particular people who recorded;
 
t
hey get a
ll of the r
ecords of their ancestor, etc.  The s
ame t
hing is being
 
h
andled here b
y Betty Tatar in connection with some of the Bishop Museum
 
holdings of c
ylinders r
ecorded i
n Micronesia.  For t
hat kind of project we have
 
to do s
ome r
eal s
lippy grant description writing to make s
ure that somebody
 
6
 
doesn't come a
long and s
ay, "
Hey, t
hat's a Humanities p
roject."  In a s
ense i
t
 
i
s, but i
n a s
ense we are pushing so hard to get the s
tuff back that we
 
emphasize t
hat.  We s
ay t
hat is what we're doing; it's just incidental that
 
t
hey're going to have to copy a
ll t
hose c
ylinders and do a
ll t
hat research.
 
The r
eason for t
his is not t
hat humanities wouldn't do i
t, but it would be a
 
very d
ifficult t
hing to get them to do it; it would take two or t
hree years.
 
And it's something we thought was very crucial and an urgent problem.
 
H
umanities does s
ome t
hings very much better than we do, b
y the way.  They've
 
got s
ome s
uperb projects, p
articularly a big one with the Eskimo.
 
So, we do presentation; we do documentation.  Now we have done something
 
e
lse t
hat has been very debatable, and I think is worth drawing to your
 
attention.  One of the c
lear needs i
n the field is for people to be on the
 
spot.  You have no i
dea how isolated you feel i
n Washington.  How to know t
hat
 
you're getting through to t
he people who really need things?  P
lus we are
 
dealing with art forms that are at their best local; they're not at their best
 
n
ationally.  God preserve us from a
ny more n
ational American folk music.  We
 
have t
hat.  We had that in World War II and it was dreadful.  It was b
land; i
t
 
was zilch.  The s
trongest, the best, t
he most exciting music is highly
 
localized.  For us to t
ry to sit in Washington and find out what n
eeds to be
 
done about t
hree congregations of sacred harp musicians in southern Alabama i
s
 
a whole other ball of wax.  I don't know how you do that.
 
There i
s a n
eed for somebody to kind of keep an eye out, to do what has
 
been r
eferred to as "
cultual tender loving care."  All of us do that in our own
 
areas the best t
hat we can.  We felt the n
eed of establishing some sort of a
 
n
etwork of this sort of thing, p
lus, if possible getting a little bit of
 
solidity through t
his n
etwork.  So it wouldn't be the occasional person who
 
happened to be r
iding through like the fellow with the white hat and the horse,
 
t
he s
ymbol.  So we began s
eeing if the s
tates p
ossibily would work with us.  It
 
was a very big chance, because what we were doing was essentially s
etting up
 
another level of b
ureaucracy.  When I first took this job, my brother took me
 
aside (
see, he's been working on these problems you know.  You may think that
 
he's a n
ut, b
ut he's been t
hinking about this a lot longer than anybody e
lse
 
and his advice is very well worth listening to).  And he told me t
hat he had
 
decided a long t
ime a
go when he was young boy going to Harvard that God had
 
invented folklorists and s
ent them h
ere on this earth to make absolutely
 
positive t
hat by no possible accident would any of the folks get any of t
he
 
money.  They would s
ee to it t
hat it got s
iphened off along the way.  Now you
 
and I as professionals are a
ll p
art of this.  I get mine before anybody e
lse
 
gets t
heirs.  And it i
s something to t
hink about a
ll of the t
ime.  We
 
professionals somehow o
r a
nother are a
lways in there because we're at t
he
 
beginning stage, you s
ee.  We're at t
he beginning stage of getting i
t
 
o
rganized.  So here I
 was, not only t
aking some money skimming right off the
 
top of the federal dollars, but I was going to set up a whole other set of
 
p
eople to skim off the s
tate level before it ever got back down to t
he folks
 
again.
 
And was that justifiable?  Was it a r
isk that I could afford to take o
r
 
t
hat I could afford to encourage other people to t
ake?  (
I'm being very
 
p
ersonal h
ere but when I s
ay "
I", i
t represents a whole program.  It represents
 
f
ifty p
eople who h
ave sweat and s
truggled and beat t
heir brains out on their
 
p
anels and p
eople who h
ave p
articipated i
n working conferences and so on.  I
'm
 
just t
he one who happens to have t
he f
loor at t
he moment.)  Well, t
he r
isk was
 
t
aken.  We t
ried to s
et it up in a way t
hat we could entice the s
tates to s
et
 
up individual p
rograms t
hat t
hey would put some money i
nto, and we would put
 
s
ome money i
nto.
 
7
 
The t
hing that we managed to get t
hrough t
hat I think has made a
 
s
ignificant difference i
s t
hat we have insisted that we would only support
 
p
rograms headed b
y t
rained professsionals.  This is the f
irst attempt made to
 
p
rofessionalize this whole business, a
nd boy, did people s
creai
i!  Including,
 
me, may I s
ay, t
o a certain extent.  I
'm not going to s
ay t
hat a Ph.D. i
n
 
ethnomusicology i
s more deserving or better o
r pure or more noble than a
 
non-Ph.D. but we felt t
hat t
he thing that had to be done was t
hat t
he whole
 
i
dea of folk had to be for-once-and-for-all out of the area of 
.
... 
Well, t
he
 
f
irst coordinator t
hat I e
ver had to cope with was the ex-girlfriend of the
 
head of the Arts agency t
hat called me and s
aid "She's a folk, Bess, I mean,
 
what t
he hell?  She's a human being, what do you want?"
 
So we have r
equested that each agency t
hat we give some money to hire
 
within a level of professional background which is partially academic and
 
p
artially e
xperiential.  That is, we recommend an M
.A. level in folklore,
 
e
thnomusicology, cultural anthropology, h
istory of art, American-Pacific
 
Studies, whatever, o
r its equivalent, with f
ield experience, language training,
 
and the e
xperience of h
aving made something, done something, put on a program,
 
p
ublished a brochure, s
omething, so that it wasn't exclusively study.  Having
 
made s
omething appear that wasn't there before.  Most of the s
tates have been
 
very interested i
n this.  They like the people that come a
nd apply with these
 
descriptions.  They're getting very high caliber people.  They're getting
 
people with e
xperience and with sophistication and training.  The folk arts
 
coordinators are now becoming a little sub-group.  There are three of them now
 
t
hat are deputy d
irectors of the Arts agency.  And I predict in a couple of
 
years we're going to have two state art agencies headed by folklorists.  In one
 
case, an ethnomusicologist, just because t
hey're so good at what they're doing.
 
We have now got s
tate programs in 35  of the 50 s
tates, which I think is sort of
 
e
xtraordinary.  I can tell you which states if you want to know.  In half of
 
t
hose, t
he position has proven to be so useful politically, culturally, and to
 
t
he education s
ystem, t
o t
he s
tate broadcast n
etworks, and so on.  It's lovely
 
to have s
omebody who knows something s
ay "Hey, we've got to do something about
 
Black History Week.  Got s
ome good i
deas?"  Off they go with a n
ice bunch of
 
books, e
xhibits, o
r whatever.  And :
he s
tates love it.  Half of the s
tates are
 
f
unding it 1
00% themselves.  We no longer have to fund those positions.  The
 
legislature of Arkansas (
which has n
ever been noted for its culture) wrote back
 
t
he other day and s
aid "take back your federal dollars, we want to hire our
 
own!"  And they gave us back $
10,000 at which I said, "Think of a
ll t
he n
ice
 
things you could do in Arkansas with $
10,000."  So t
hey came up with a real
 
n
ifty i
dea and everybody's happy.
 
I
'll p
ass these around, everyone can take a look.  [Brochures] Very
 
i
nteresting are t
he areas that don't have them.  Let me point out something
 
s
ignificant that doesn't show up here pictorially so well.  We do not have
 
s
tate programs in W
. Virginia, Virginia, S
. Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee...no
 
accident, i
t's a little bit country.  Little bit low class.  I mean, really
 
Georgia wants to be known as the "Athens of the South."  The West also.  The
 
western s
tates t
hat you s
ee, they think that t
hey're a litle more sophisticated
 
than us Easterners think they are.  So they're going to prove it by not having
 
a folk arts program, because that would put them back there with a
ll those
 
rural s
tates.  Take a look.
 
So Hawaii now has its first folk arts coordinator, Lynn Martin.  Lynn
 
Martin is an artist:  she p
ractices the art of basketry.  The back end of h
er
 
car, i
f you want to go down and take a look, i
s full of e
xcellent baskets and
 
she h
as done s
omething that I find more and more p
eople are doing these days
 
and i
t i
s s
omething very important.  She h
as apprenticed herself to
 
8
 
b
asket—makers, i
n another words she has made a s
trong, personal
, i
ndividual
 
commitment to t
he mastery of a particular folk art.  People do t
his in
 
ethnomusicology a lot more t
han they do in folklore and folk art.  I recommend
 
i
t as a humbling experience and as an experience that puts you r
ight at t
he
 
heart of the mystery of the creative process.  It's just as difficult, just as
 
emotionally a
bsorbing as putting yourself u
nder the apprenticeship of any
 
"
classic" arts.  Same process exactly.  And this leads me to another t
hing that
 
we're doing i
n t
he Folk Arts program a
nd that is we are working very hard on
 
how to develop good apprenticeship programs.

Bear i
n mind the upcoming South Pacific Arts Festival, a big celebration in
 
December '
8)4, I believe.  I hope that Hawaii sends a really distinguished
 
delegation.  It's going to be in New C
aledonia in 1
98)
4.  There are a lot of
 
p
ossible t
hings; I think touring, I think radio; attention by the experts is
 
very helpful.  You have no i
dea how important it is to have s
cholars working.
 
Most of us think that we sort of drudge away and nobody e
ver reads a thing
 
because i
ts a
ll footnotes.  Keep the standards up; you're making a permanent
 
record of what t
he s
tandards are at a particular t
ime.  You're giving people
 
s
omething to look at.  I know that the work on American quilting has resulted
 
i
n the upgrading of American quilting in the past ten years.  The fact t
hat
 
p
eople went o
ut and took pictures and showed that t
here was a t
radition like
 
t
his increased the interest, and made it a
ll come a
live for people, and they
 
s
topped doing i
t as s
loppily as they were because they felt that people would
 
p
ay attention to it.
 
[
Discussion of brochures t
hat Ms. Hawes d
istributed.]
 
Q
:  You have mentioned p
olicy covering a great deal i
n the P
acific.  I
s there
 
a
nything happening to cover other areas like China, Japan, t
he Philippines, o
r
 
others.
 
BH: In p
oint of f
act, something that might amuse you, t
he Folk Arts program
 
f
unds t
akes care of the funding of Chinese opera and Japanese kabuki at t
he
 
Arts endowment, not because we have confused it and think it's a folk art, b
ut
 
because we have e
thnomusicologists, people competent to make some decisions in
 
t
hat area, o
n o
ur panel.  So sometimes, the p
eople i
nvolved get a little
 
i
rritated.  "We're not a folk; we're a high art form!"
 
We deal with a
ll of the arts that are e
xtant in the United States.  We do
 
not deal with a
rts of c
itizens in the United States.  If the art form is
 
contributing to the health a
nd whatever of t
he American people and is being
 
done t
here, t
hen we feel its the responsibility.  The issue of c
itizenship
 
n
ever arises, a
nd, by the way, should not i
n the arts' and this is not just i
n
 
the folk arts.  If you had to go and ask how many of the violin s
ection of the
 
C
leveland Symphony are citizens, you might f
ind some embarrassing questions
 
t
here too.  I don't t
hink it has any relevance i
n the arts, if the t
hing is
 
going on i
n t
he United States.  We are limited in terms of working abroad,
 
because t
he State Department has its own funding and its own principles in
 
terms of things that go on overseas.  For e
xample, if you run into people who
 
are i
nterested i
n the P
acific Arts Festival, we cannot pay o
verseas travel to
 
t
ake p
eople to New C
aledonia; we can, o
n the other hand, cover rehearsal
 
e
xpenses and bring i
n a dance master from Truk and whatever you have to do to
 
work up a good program for presentation t
here.  Costuming, building your boat,
 
whatever.

'm very much i

I
'm p

think i
t's an extraordinary
 
for this sort of  mysterious
 
arts.
 I tend to feel it's the
 
ogether, because that's the
 
agencies were set up at the same time, and the idea behind them was that
 
it was a proper concern for the federal government to try to stimulate activities
 
-
i
in the body politic concerning the arts and concerning the humanities.  We
 
were not going to set up a national policy in connection with the arts/  We were
 
not going to set up a national theater or a national ballet company  or a national
 
anything.  We were going to try to see to i
t, in the area of the arts, that there
 
were artistic actic*ities blooming wherever the American people live.  And we were
 
going to try to stimulate the artists Q0 were in residence in those local communities
 
a- 1 4- C
+A QS t&.
 
to produce4 W were going to try to help what was already going on.  The same thing,
 
where the federal
 
of course, applies to the humanities
 government i
s trying to help stimulate
 
research into the areas of history and to the areas that are generally defined within
 
the humanities' domain.
 
Now I

agencies were set up at the s
ame time, and the idea behind them was that
 
i
t was a proper concern for the federal government to try to stimulate activities
 
1in the body politic concerning the arts and concerning the humanities.  We
 
were not going to set up a national policy in connection with the arts/  We were
 
not going to set up a national theater or a national ballet company  or a national
 
anything.  We were going to try to see to it, in the area of the arts, that there
 
were artistic actic ities blooming wherever the American people live.  And
 
going to try to s
timulate the artists w

Now I

trying to help stimulate

the arts
 
just to tell you
 
coining from,  the Arts
 
rogram that worries about
 
worries about literature,
 
2
 
I have a program that is called folk arts, and we have defined folk arts as the
 
program that worries about small groups within our society, groups that identify
 
themselves within our society by sharing the same occupation, ethnicity, religion,
 
neighborhood, -
-
 all those things that you identify yourself by.That you live
 
on the west side of Chicago i
s a meaningful remark to Chigagoans who know t
1t that
 
that means m you are of a particular group and that you share certain things in
 
common.  Those ideas are expressed by art forms invariably.  They may be highly
 
developed art forms such as the hula among the Hawaiians here or they may be smaller
 
in-group g jones such as computer specialist jokes, x for example.
 
gheir identitity
 
But everybody will express themselves eventually through some sort of
 
artistic development, which may be tiny and inside or may be great and gorgeous.
 
But it always has to do with a particular group.  The wk work of the Folk Arts
 
Program is to assist, in whatever way we cars the art forms of these particular groups
 
throughout our society and you might thinkQ
therefor , that we woul
have an enormous
 
budget and a huge staff  because there are so many groups and they are so very
 
productive right across our country.  For various reasons the Program is very small
 
and has a very small staff and in fact is the smallest program within the Endowment.
 
We have a little teeny bit of money to give, and we try to put it to very good use
 
nd I think we do
 I think we've done some very nice things. 4
'd what I have to tell
 
you about is, then, colored by by my having met with a great many people in my office
 
and a great many people on the road  who are talking to me aboutt their needs as
 
membersof small groups with developing, or highly developed, art forms, and what
 
should they do and how can they do i
t?  And as I go around, I hear the same stories.
 
l
ong gap on tape
 
 
l
isten to the old music and listen to the songs that we used to dance to -
-
 
all those things.  And as I think about i
t and as I talk about i
t, I get
 
kind of tear)' myself because I think this i
s a universal human experience,
 
I think this i
s a xmixie
 
a universal cultural experience.
 
And perhaps if we could s
tart thinking about cultures in these
 
rather simple forms, we wouldn't get so upset when people get angry at us
 
when'we're just trying to help'
... And we get insulted sometimes, and wzgetzxx
 
we know that people are in deep concern because they feel that somehow or other
 
their cultural integrity i
s being assailed, and they're losing too much.  And
 
we might be able to understand then the terrible damage I think that i
s being
 
to them
 
done/psychically when they don't have available to them easily the fundamental
 
parts of their culture -
-
 their l
iterature, their art, their music -
-
 easily
  
available, l
ike you can open the album and Ikeir there i
t i
s beautifully
 
photographed, pieces of art that you can go and look at.
 
And when I read this article, I thought that is why, everywhere I
 
go in this country people come to me in every community and say...
 I say
 
to them  '
Jhat would you l
ike" and they say,  A museum".  And I think to myself,
 
my goodness, the United States is going to have more museums than it can possibly
 
support,  How can we support an ethnic museum for every ethnicity in every
 
city, because that's what they all waX want.  But this is why they want i
t, and
 
i
t's a real need, i
t's a real human need.  And we must begin to develop strategies
 
in some way or
 
Xx
gi xto meet this need/ i
&xi
Rxxx)c
xziqd another, and that is the reason -
-
 now,
 
this i
s a long preamble ee for the title of what I said I wanted to talk about -
-
what are some possible strategies for meeting these needs? -
 Because they exist
 
in a context -
-
 and this is the other thing I wanted to say that I think is cheerful
 
-
-
 I
've gotten off onto the sad side, but
 this i
s,
 
I think, very cheerful -
-
 something that I found that has greatly houyed me in
 
my travels around talking to people-- and I wrote this in a paper (
and I

 I was telling Aary Bitternan, I wrote i
t i
n a  aper a year or so ao, and
 
I went back and read i
t and I thought, gee whiz -
 =  this is the very simple
 
sentence that I wroteand by gum, i
t really had a lix lot to i
t (
laughing)
 
really
 
I could have left the x
s rest of the paper out.  This remark was, I think, ver"
 
meaningful and i
t was a very simp t
h sentence:
 '
Everyhpdy i
s going to wveryhody
 
e
lse's festivals.
 
remark
 
'
low, as I say, that's a veryksimp
-mindedstatement, but I can tell
 
you,  E
'
ifty years ago if the Chinese had a festival
 
my folks wouldn't have .
'one to i
t.
 
in my home town, wxw
i
x
 
That was a Chinese thing;
 
they siould do that thing, 'e didn't think we would he welcome, maybe.
 I
 
t
!oy just iidn't.  But every festival I go to i
s just full of people
 
going, interested, wanting to learn, wanting to find out, and the people who are
 
running the festivals are saying most of the time -
-
 unless ikc they are religious
 
and private c
and that's special) but they are mostly saying, Gee it's nice to
 
have somebody e
lse come.  They are open to the experience, and I find that every-
where I go, and i
t's a
 
that something new has
 
xenophobic as they once
 
new development, i
t's a development that makes me think
 
happened to the American people that they are not as
 
were, they are not as frightened, they are genuinely
 
interested in the differences.  They have kind of got it through their heads
 
in a certain way that everybody is prettyk close to human because I can talk
 
U  the way I
've been talking to you to any standard group in the United States
 
and people will start to say, well, you know, that's right, everybody ought to
 
get to be the way they are, that's fair, that's okay, that's the American way,
 
The melting pot idea has begun to melt.
 It's trickling out the holes.  It's not
 
with us nearly so much as it was and along with i
t has then come a genuine
 
and I think encourageable interest in helping other people be who they are and
 
and finding out what it's like, and finally being
 
interested and supporting somebody e
lse's cultural activity.
