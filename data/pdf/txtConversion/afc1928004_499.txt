Sung Y,ith great success by Barlow, Wilson, Primrose 
West's Minstr7I-s., 
Round de meadows am a 
ringing 
The darkies' mournful song, 
While the mocking-bird is singing, 
lIappy as the day is long. 
Where the ivy is a 
creeping 
O'er the grassy mound, 
There old massa is a 
sleeping, 
Sleeping in the cold, cold ground.

IOR S. 
I 
)own in the corn- field 
hear that mournful sound 
All the darkies are a 
weeping— 
Massa's in the cold, cold ground. 
Muni the autumn leaves were falling, 
When the irays were cold, 
'Twas hard to hear old massa 
Cause he was so weak and old. 
Now the orange tree is blooming 
On the sandy shore, 
Now the summer days arc coming, 
Massa never calls no more. 
Down in Ihe 
Massa made the darkies lot e him, 
lie always was so kind, 
N-ow they sadly weep above him, 
Vourning, fir !! e 
leave them behind, 
Oh de Old Folks am Gone. 
01,1) MAN PLANTATION CHARACTER SUNG. 
l''ung by Barlow, 'Wilson, Primrose and West's Minstrels. 
Far, far in many lands I've wandeed, 
Sadly and lone, 
-My heart was ever turning southward, 
To all the dear ones at home ; 
Here, after all my weary roaming. 
At early dawn, 
I've come and find the cot still standing, 
But, oh, the old folks are gone. 
CHORUS. 
Here I 
wander sad and lonely, 
In the dear old home, 
Those that I 
loved so well and fondly— 
All, all the old folks are gone. 
Here's where I 
frolic'd with my brother, 
Under the tree, 
Here's were I 
knelt beside my mother, 
From care and sorrow free ; 
Still sing the little birds as sweetly, 
At night and morn, 
Still runs the little brook as fleetly. 
But 0, the old folks are gone. 
Here I 
wander sad and lonely, & c. 
Down where the old banana's waving. 
They're laid to rest, 
Where Swanee's peaceful water's laving 
The green turf o'er their breast ; 
But there's a 
home I 
know, where parting 
Never can come; 
Oh, for that home I 
must be starting, 
There's where the old folks are gone. 
Here I 
wander sad and lonely, 
Love Not! 
Dedicated to all broken heartetl-minstrels. 
Sung by FRANK HANON. 
Love not 
love not ! ye hapless sons of clay ; 
Hope's gayest wreaths are made of earthly flow'rs, 
Things that are made to fade and pass away 
Ere they have blossom'd for a 
few short hours, 
Love not ! love not ! 
Love not ! love not ! the thing you love may die, 
May perish from the gay a.nd gladsome earth ; 
The silent stars, the blue and smiling sky 
Beams on its grave, as once upon its birth, 
Love not ! love not ! 
Love not ! love not ! the one you love may change ; 
The rosy lip may cease to smile on you, 
The kindly-beaming eye grow cold and strange, 
The heart still warmly beat, yet not be true. 
Love not ! love not ! 
Love not ! love not ! oh, warning vainly said 
In present hours, as in years gone by ; 
Love flings a 
halo round the dear one's head, 
Faultless, immortal, till they change or die. 
Love not ! love not ! 
Go Down to the Cotton Fields.

When summer flowers are withered, 
. 
And lost their sweet perfume, 
And autumn's chill and mournful winds 
Have laid them in their tomb, 
We seek the leaf strewn valleys, 
And wander where they grew, 
And think with dark and beating heart, 
We soon must 
follow too. 
When summer flowers are withered, 
And lost their sweet perfume, 
And autumn's chill and mournful winds 
have laid them in their tomb ; 
And autumn's chill and mournful winds 
Have laid them in their tomb. 
When summer flowers are withered. 
'Tis sweet for us to know, 
That when the wintry days have passed, 
Those beauteous ones will blow, 
And when the golden sunshine 
Comes down from warmer skies, 
The flowers we lost in autumn's hours, 
Again will greet our eyes. 
When summer flowers are withered 
'Tis sweet for us to know, 
That when the wintry days have passed 
Those beauteous ones will blow ; 
Then when the wintry days have passed 
Those beauteous ones will blow.

You're fairer than the lily, 
Your pretty face I

That oft so sweetly smiling, 
My poor, sad soul beguiling, 
Is left alone to bear this parting pain. 
Hope may in gloom he shrouded, 
And life be overclouded, 
To think that fate has torn away front me 
Life's fondest hope forever, 
That I 
may see thee never ; 
Still one fond heart will ever think of thee.

Where are the kind hearts with love to bestow ? 
Lonely I

was gay, 
Dreaming of joys that have faded away. 
flack like a

Seeking in vain for my welcoming star!

Where are the old friends so dear to my heart ?

Where are the kind hearts with love to bestow ? 
Lonely I

Dreaming of joys that have faded away, 
(Repeat chorus.) 
Where are the lov'd ones that wish'd me good-bye? 
Wild are the echoes that give me reply; 
Strangers have come to the home of my heart, 
Sweet home of childhood again we must part! 
When far away in my silence and pain, 
Hope gave me courage to come back again ; 
Strangers now greet me, oh why did I 
come ! 
Where are the old friends, and where is my home? 
Where are the old friends, &c. 
Where is the fair one I 
ne'er could forget ? 
Her last word at parting is dear to me yet; 
Vain were my dreams of her dear eyes of blue, 
Vain is the love I 
have brought back so true. 
Sad and forsaken my life now must be, 
No ray of sunshine is beaming for me ; 
Toss'd is my bark on a 
wild darken'd shore, 
Far from the old friends that greet me no more. 
Where are the old friends, &c,

But now we're tired roaming around, 
So we're going home once more.

Way out among the shamrocks,

We'll never roam again.

Last Wednesday I 
attended 
A 
raffle for a 
stove, 
In aid of the wife and family 
Of Timothy J. Cosgrove. 
Kellys, llogans, and O'Briens, 
All came in a 
drove, 
To take the dice and shake them nice., 
And try and win the stove, 
CHORUS. 
Forward four, allaman left, while the music it did play, 
'Twas grand delight to see the sight of those Irishmen so 
gay, 
I 
never laughed so hearty in the course of all my life 
Looking at Plug McCarty, pivotin' with his wife. 
At nine o'clock precisely 
The raffling it begun, 
Tom Kelly he jumped ten foot high 
When sixty-four was flung; 
O'Brien yelled out murder, 
With a 
brick his eye was closed ; 
On that night I 
had to fight, 
While raffling for the stove. 
( 
Chorus.) 
At six o'clock in the morning 
The raffling it was o'er, 
Tom Kelly he got staving drunk 
And stole away the door; 
.Clancy with a 
bott.e, 
Sure he all the windows broke; 
Cosgrove grabbed him by the neck, 
And boys, I 
thought he'd choke.

in the laughable sketch, entitled ' Tb

There is a 
girl of famous note 
Among the upper nine, 
Considerably comilfo, 
Or something in that line ; 
When but a 
child she answered to 
The sudden name of " Nan," 
But now her high- tuned monnygram 
Is Bidalia Jane McCann.

Bidalia Jane McCann, the elegant Miss McCann, 
There's none so sweet as her, no girl so neat as her, 
Peggy or Julia, Johanna or Kate, like Bidalia Jane McCann, 
The elegant Miss McCann, I'm sure there's not wan, 
That can bate the bon- ton of Bidalia Jane McCann. 
Her education's wonderful, 
She spells and writes by ear, 
She plays the " Maiden's Prairie," 
And sings " Beloved Ear." 
She says, " Neel so fatigayed 
I 
don't know what to do," 
Says I, " Bidale, some grub and ale, 
Might help your fatigu." 
(Charms.) 
She gives a " German" every week, 
And " Irish" too as well, 
She says a 
cork would shade my face, 
So I 
could tend the bell ; 
She sings duets all by herself, 
She talks French like a 
man, 
She's very an reroir indeed, 
Is Bedelia Jane McCann.

There lives a 
pretty Irish queen, 
To me she does prove dear. 
Her mother takes in washing, 
And the girl helps at the trade, 
And when I've called upon her 
These words I've often said : 
CHORUs. 
Mary Ann McLaughlin, don't you cry, 
Take that apron from your eye; 
_Don't you let the neighbors hear you sigh,

Now soon I'm going to married be, 
Of course I'll settle down ; 
I'll buy a

And clasp your hands above me; 
So while I 
ask to die that day, 
The day you will not love me. 
The day you will not love me. 
You need not check the thoughts that rise 
With darkness wrapt about them, 
For gazing in your earnest eyes, 
My heart can almost doubt them. 
Yet hush my whispers as you may, 
Such chidings do not fret me; 
Ah no, I

In the old home by the hillside 
I 
used to laugh and play, 
And I

Till the old folks pass'd away ; 
Then I 
was left to wander 
In loneliness and pain ;

Where our stout-hearted ancestors shrank back afraid—

As we pass, day by day, thro life's busy highway, 
There are many strange people we see ; 
And the worst, I 
conclude, are the ones who intrude 
On our charity, be it so free. 
For they seem to depend upon what we will lend, 
Not a 
dollar they honestly earn ; 
Yet they prosper and thrive, and the way survive 
Is, to borrow and never return ! 
Yes, they borrow but never return, 
So of course it is easy to learn, 
There are sonic folks that live, not to spend or to give, 
But to borrow and never return ! 
If you lay up in store a

Upon this you can truly depend, 
They will sure find it out, and they'll chase you about,

our money to lend. 
If you doubtingly say, 
I'm afraid you won't pay," 
Such ideas of course they will spurn ; 
And you'll find out some day, I 
am right when I 
say, 
That they borrow, but never return ! 
Yes, they borrow, Sc. 
In the fashion they dress, and their manners express 
They have plenty to eat and to wear ; 
But they'd be in the shade if their bills were all pai ,/ 
And the poor-house would have them in care. 
'Tis no wonder they smile when they pass you in sty44 —, 
It is better to beg than to earn ; 
While it's true, as a 
rule, they will deem you a 
fool, 
Whez they borrow, to never return ! 
Yes, they borro,/, Ay. 
THE DONliET, 
IN'rds and Itlusic by the late JAMES BRADLEY. 
As sung -iih 
great success all over the country by Tim ROGERS. 
I'VE got a 
donkey, he stands six foot high, 
I'll sell to the man that wishes to buy. 
lie drinks Seltzer Water whenever he's dry. 
In a 
race on the turf he has never proved shy ; 
He makes good time—about one mile.a day. 
I'll match him again any stallion or bay. 
Ile fought for his country, he's bee' through the war; 
I 
feed him or herrings, hay, rope, and tar. 
CHORUS. 
I've got a 
donkey, he's not very chunky, 
I'll trade for a 
monkey, to any old flunkey, 
Now wouldn't that be hunky, if he had my donkey, 
And I 
had his monkey, my donkey also ? 
If he's locked hi the stable he'll make a 
stiff kick; 
If he wants to get out he'll pretend he is sick; 
I 
call out my donkey—his name it is Dick. ' 
I 
coax him along with a 
hickory stick. 
If I 
leave in his box a 
big bale of hay, 
He'll eat it all up and leave none for next day. 
Last week he broke loose, and he got astray; 
He was found irt a 
sewer in Avenue A. 
I've got a 
donkey, etc. 
I 
harnessed him up last St. Patrick's day, 
I 
rode on his back so cheerful and gay, 
We started from the corner of Tenth and Broadway, 
We rode to the hall, without any delay. 
Just as we were passing by Central Park, 
A boy fired a 
pistol .off, just for a 
lark, 
The donkey fell down, which caused a 
blockade, 
Only for fifty horse- doctors he'd spoil the parade. 
I've got a

About half past twelve o'clock last imigh 
A

They woke inc up and set me tight, 
For to walk against O'Leary. 
They took me to a 
great big field, 
And with alcohol se me crazy, 
They stripped 11le clothes off to the skin, 
And rt made me feel so lazy; 
It was then the gang commenced to talk. 
Saying who is the terrier going to walk. 
And they said they would hang me if I'd batik 
When I 
walked against O'Leary. 
The first mile I 
walked my legs were weak, 
And the gang commenced to holler, 
They spi ink-led salt upon the track 
And hit me with an iron dollar. 
All the other walkers were ahcad, 
Eating sponge cake, pie and bread,

When I 
walked against O'Leary. 
I 
walked until I 
catehed the cramps, 
Around and around the track, 
All the ladies threw bouquets at me, 
Tnere was a 
corn upon my back; 
The judge told me it was time to stop 
As around the track like a 
chicken l'd flop, 
For the want of a 
whiskey I

The Dear Old Flag of Green. 
Written for PADDY and ELLA M URPHY by BARNEY FAGAN. 
How proudly floats forth our noble flag of green— 
That emblem of purity—in solitude serene. 
With rapture and delight the Irish bosoms heave ; 
To earth its oppressors our martyrs yet will cleave 
No taint of dishonor at that banner ever hurled, 
Since first its proud foulds to the breeze were unfurled. 
May the bright suns of heaven cast their beams on that 
spot, 
And let a 
day of freedom be the Irishmen's lot. 
CHORUS. 
Then let your shouts re-echo, far, far across the sea, 
All loyal sons stand ready to see that isle set free ; 
Quickly swell your ranks, and let your war cry be : 
Death to the tyrants ; on, on to victory ! 
With pride we can look on the noble deeds and fame 
Of Irelands trusty warriors—immortal be their names. 
Foremost in the strife amid the shot and shell, 
The glorious din of battle- cry our patriots help to swell. 
Their praises resound throughout our noble land, 
On every battle field their deeds of bravery stand. 
With courage true as steel and eager for the fray, 
Right manfully they strive to help gain the day. 
Then let your shouts, &c. 
All honor to the heroes now lying ' neath the clay, 
The memory of their valiant deeds never shall decay. 
Unfurl to the breeze the flag they love so dear, 
Proclaim to its foes they'll yet have cause to fear. 
Loud above the din of the roaring cannon's peel, 
The steady tread of cavalry, the clanging of the steel, 
Will be heard the cry of victory, as it resounds from 
shore to shore, 
Old Ireland's sons will wake to find their bondage chains 
no more. 
Then let your shouts, Ste.

Driginally sung with thunders of applause throughout the Eastern cities 
by the " Trish Emperors," FAVOR and SHIELDS. 
Here we are, two Lackawanna spooners, 
While we're here cast your eyes upon us; 
We unload coal boats from Harlem to Gowanus, 
We're the two selected spooners of the gang. 
When we go home, our families we embrace, 
We ate our meals with elegance and grace, 
We'll lay aside the shovel, for we long to have a 
race, 
We're the two selected spooners of the gang. 
CHORUS. 
When we go home, our families we embrace, 
We ate our meals with elegance and grace ; 
We'll lay aside the shovel, for we long to have a 
race 
We're the two selected spooners of the gang. 
We all live down in John McSauley's building, 
Last election day we cast our votes for Tilden ; 
And they all do say we're the solidest in the building, 
The two selected spooners of the gang. 
We all get shaved in the one barber shop, 
By the one man, his razor, and his strop; 
We all get the lather from the one brush and cup, 
The two selected spooners of the gang.

In Scotland, France and Germany, 
Music you will hear, 
The Italian loves to play the harp,

Sweet music always charms my ear, 
Wherever it may be, 
I

They have such harmony.

The Irish songs are soft and sweet, 
They harmonize so well,

There's Bobby Burns, the great Scotch poet, 
Whose memory shall reign 
In Scotland where he lived and died, 
And honored was his name.

There's one now whom I'll name, 
his praise is sung both far and near,

Who Americans will adore, 
his works are read throughout this world, 
From this to foreign shore.

Sung by T. M. IIENGLER. 
As I 
strolled out one evening, 
he sun had just gone down 
While pleasantly meandering 
.1. little way from town, 
I 
then beheld a 
damsel 
With eyes the brightest blue 
Beneath her dark eyelashes, 
Like violets dipped in dew. 
CHORUS. 
She smiled so sweet upon me, (symph.) 
That moment she had won me, 
'Twas love the first I 
knew. 
There some sweet charm entrancing, 
With this dear girl so fair, 
A 
rosy. soft expression, 
With a 
mass of Golden Hair. 
Now, I 
followed on behind her, 
I 
think she knew it well, 
And as a 
sweet reminder, 
Her handkerchief it fell ; 
1 
raised the scented linen 
From off the grassy ground ; 
Tier name, in letters crimson, 
On one corner then I 
found. 
Al length I 
did approach her, 
And ventured in the task, 
Ily asking her permission 
To join her lonely walk; 
She blushing, frowning. smiling, 
Said, oh I 
think you rude, 
But those blue eyes, beguiling. 
Seemed to say, I 
wish you would,

Go to sleep, my little darling, 
Rest on mother's loving breast, 
And the angels will protect you 
'When within your cradle rest ; 
Far above the starry heavens, 
They are looking down on you, 
So repose, my precious darling, 
Close your tiny eyes of blue.

Rest your head on mother's breast, 
And the angels will protect you, 
When within your cradle rest. 
Far a-down the dewy meadow, 
All the daises are asleep. 
And the birdies in the branches 
Also are in slumber deep. 
But in Eden far above us, 
Angel eyes are open wide, 
And you are as safe, my darling, 
Ls if they were at your side. 
Go to sleep, &c. 
In the early morning, darling, 
Little robin in the tree 
Will awake you from your slumber, 
When he sings his merry glee. 
Then I'll take you to my bosom, 
Till the glimmer on the plain 
Tells us that the sun is shining, 
And the day aas come again.

Oh many moons have passed and -

Since first I 
went to school. 
At Harvard, dear old Harvard, friends, 
I 
learned the Golden Rule; 
My classmates scattered here and there, 
All trod their different ways, 
I 
love to think and ponder o'er 
My youthful college days. 
(Repeal last two lines) 
I 
remember when a 
Freshman there, 
My age just twenty-four, 
In the Yale and Harvard race, my friends, 
I 
always rowed stroke oar 
Our colors—handsome scarlh bright— 
First led the van always, 
Admired by the ladies all, 
Was I 
in college days. 
(Repeat last two lines.) 
Oh, the day when I 
did graduate, 
I 
was my parents pride, 
Fitted for the bar or bench, 
A 
linguist, too, beside; 
Socially I'd always meet 
My colleagues bright and gay, 
And toss a 
merry social glass, 
To our commencement day.

In every worldly clime; 
You may crush them down unto the ground, 
With poverty's cold ways, 
They'll rise again, assert their claims.

HURRAH FOR THE MINSTREL BAND! 
Dedicated to HARRY SANDERSON. 
Originally sung by FRANK LEWIS 
Music published by E.

HARDING, 229 Bowery, N. IT. 
Itice, 10 cti 
There is not a 
man in the whole Minstrel Band, 
Who would ever go back on a 
friend ; 
Tho' dark be his face, yet the black can't efface 
The kind deeds which through life him attend. 
I 
hear the trumpet sounding, sounding, 
In notes loud and clear through the land— 
I 
list to its voice, and it bids me rejoice ; 
Then hurrah for the Minstrel Band ! 
Then Hurrah ! then Hurrah ! 
Then hurrah for the Minstrel Band 
I 
will speak first of one who we loved in the past, 
He'd a 
heart that was noble and brave--
Nelse Seymour, who never refused his last dime, 
If' he thought you from hunger stwould save. 
I 
hear his praises sounding, sounding, 
In notes loud and clear through the land— 
The tall Son of York, he died at his work, 
And the pride of the Minstrel Band ! 
And the pride !--- and the pride ! 
And the pride of the Minstrel Band ! 
Brave Unsworth, he stood like a 
Minstrel so true 
"rill defeated at last by grim death ; 
And Budworth, alas ! broke his old banjo string, 
Which he loved ' till he parted with Lreath. 
hear their dirge now sounding, sounding, 
In notes loud and clear through the land. 
They lived and they died with the Boys that they lov'd, 
The dear Boys of the Minstrel Band ! 
The Dear Boys ! the Dear Boys ! 
The Dear Boys of the Minstrel Band ! 
But now I 
must speak of the Prince of them all--
Who is that but our own gallant Dan ! 
_Let every one mourn ior our Chieftan is gone--
Dan Bryant ! the Minstrel and Man ! 
2. near his praises sounding, sounding, 
in notes loud and clear through the land. 
Ile lived and he died, both our glory and pride; 
He was King of the Minstrel Band ! 
He was King ! he was King ! 
He was King of the Minstrel Band

DANCING IN THE SUNLIGHT, 
'Written and composed by JAMES MAAS for the GIRARD BROoli-
ERS, and sung by them with immense success, at the 
Howard Athemeum, Boston. 
What a 
pleasure there is in dancing the sunlight, 
When all earth seems to smile; 
It makes a 
merry ringing in your laughter, 
You have no care or guile. 
With ringing notes from pearly throats, 
We while the hours away; 
With beaming smite our time beguile, 
We are always blythe and gay. 
Oh, what a 
pleasure there is dancing in the sunlight 
When all earth seems to smile; 
It makes a 
merry ringing in your laughter, 
You have no care or guile. 
CHORUS. 
Hark, hark! hear the music ring, (
sym ) 
Shout, shout 
raise your voice and sing. (sym.) 
What a 
pleasure there is dancing in the sunlight, 
When all earth seems to smile; 
it makes a 
merry ringing in your laughter, 
You have no care or guile. 
What a 
pleasure there is dancing in the sunlight, 
For it will make you glad; 
In the golden rays its shadow it will mock you, 
And whirl and dance like mad. 
When sunset's come, and day is done, 
And darkness claims her right, 
We'll go to rest, and the blest, 
The rays of morning light. 
Ohl What a 
pleasure there is dancing in the sunlight, 
When all earth seems to smile; 
makes a 
merry ringing in your laughter, 
You have no care or guile. 
Hark, hark, etc.
