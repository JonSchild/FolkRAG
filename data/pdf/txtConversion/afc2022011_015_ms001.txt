Interviewee in English: 
I learned how to weave by watching people as they were 
weaving.  I was a bad girl when I was little.  People would get 
mad at me, so they didn’t want to teach me how to weave. 
 
Interviewer in Ulithian: 
00:54 Homa komahoi fedalei deur mo iya? 
 
Interviewer in English: 
So, where did you watch people weave? 
 
Interviewee in Ulithian: 
00:56 Lol ipon mo, yimasa fedalei deur la yal mala silmem mo

Interviewee in English: 
I would watch the ladies weaving at the women’s house, and I 
also watched my mom when she wove. 
 
Interviewer in Ulithian: 
01:06 Iwe ngo ahh… mada makla fafel rema dedeur irel yathla?

thread?

mwol ye, yela m’mol ngal yei. 
 
Interviewee in English: 
There was thread and local fibers.  They were weaving both 
thread and local fibers. For myself, I learned from dried layers 
of the banana trunk, and I made a toy loom and imitated what 
I’d seen the ladies doing when they wove. By the time I started 
to weave with thread, I was able to do it.

Interviewee in English: 
The first lavalava I wove, when was it, 1972? No, it was in 
1982. I was an adolescent, maybe about 10 or 11 years old.  It 
was the first lavalava that I wove. I made the warp and then I 
completed the weaving, all by myself. But, my mom helped me 
transfer the warp from the warping board to the loom. The day 
my lavalava was completed, we gave it away to somebody. 
 
Interviewer in Ulithian:

Interviewee in English: 
Yes, and they laughed at it because I did not make the edge 
designs. I just made the edge of the lavalava plain so it would 
be easier for me.

When I came to understand what lavalava is, I knew all the

Interviewee in English: 
Weaving has changed a lot since I learned to weave.  In the 
past, lavalava were woven to a standard that is acceptable in 
our culture. Men’s lavalava (deur/guluch) is narrower and 
longer than women’s lavalava. These days, men are not 
wearing them anymore.  We are only making them for men 
when they die. We cannot use a women’s lavalava for a 
deceased man.  The lavalava has to be the men’s style, which 
is guluch.  These days, we can mixed local fibers with thread 
and weave. People are using any kind of colors they like.  
Women wear any kind of color they like. In the past, it had to 
be black and white or blue and yellow or white.  The edge of 
the lavalava also helps to identify if it is for a man or a woman. 
Those are the things that have changed. 
 
06:31 Question 5  
5.    If you could talk to your great-granddaughter about weaving, what would you want to tell 
her?

Interviewee in English: 
We need to tell our kids to sit down so we can teach them how 
to weave because weaving is something that is very important, 
and it’s very important for them to know.  We need to let them 
know that weaving is what gives us clothing, and we use it to 
beg for forgiveness.  We use it for almost everything.  We also 
sell it when we need money.  That’s why it is important to sit 
these girls down and teach them how to weave, because it will 
be useful to them in so many ways.
