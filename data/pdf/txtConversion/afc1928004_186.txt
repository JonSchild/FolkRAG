I 
Want to Go 1101113 to Mamma. 
I 
ONCE had a 
sweetheart, tho' her name was Brown, 
She was most decidedly green; 
'But when you have seen her you'll say she's as nice 
A 
young lady as ever was seen. 
And then she's so funny, she's just like a 
child, 
She : oved me, but much better far 
She loved her dear parents, for always she said: 
"I want to go home to Mamma." 
Cnonns. 
I 
want to go home to Mamma, 
I 
want to go home to Mamma, 
It's naughty, I 
say, to keep me away, 
When I 
want to go home to Mamma. 
When first I 
beheld her, I 
thought what a 
dear! 
With joy, oh! I 
nearly went wild, 
But when I 
began to boo and to coo, 
Why she sniveled out like a 
child. 
I 
thought she was ill, I 
couldn't make her out, 
When she jumped up and said, "oh, ta-ta 
I 
said, 
Pray don!t, you go," when she simpered out, qict 
I 
want to go homelo Mamma. 
I 
want to go home, tke.. 
Well, with lots of persuasion ant coaxing andesaa, 
The worst job I've had in my tile: 
5'11 
4 
I 
contrived to persuade her t 
loved her so much, 
That she said she would be my wife. 
We drove to the church, when oh! what a 
scene. 
She would have the door left ajar; 
When the clergyman said, " Will you wed?" sic shriekel out; 
"No c 
I 
want to go home to Mamma. 
I 
want to go home, to. 
At last we were married; oh, my, what a 
job 
To the continent then off we went, 
And I 
am happy to say she her nervousness lost 
When the honeymoon cosy we'd spent. 
And now she's so different to what she once was, 
We're happy by night and by day; 
Her marriage she says she will never regret, 
And no more do I 
hear her say: 
I 
want to home, 4t,c

Waiting, My Darling, for Thee. 
Sung by M ISS ADA W RAY. 
I'VE been waiting for more than an hour, love, 
Yes, waiting and watching for thee, 
While hoping and praying you'd come, love, 
And keep true your promise to me; 
For, you told me you'd meet me this evening, 
And listen to what I've to say— 
For, to speak the plain truth, I 
am certain 
I 
can't tell you all in a 
day. 
CnoBus. 
By the lilies that float down the river, 
By the cowslips that grow on the lea, 
By the roses that bloom in the forest, 
I'm waiting, my darling for thee, 
I'm waiting, yes, waiting, 
I'm waiting, my darling, for thee; 
I'm waiting, yes, waiting, 
I'm waiting, my darling, for thee. 
For more than a 
year I 
have waited, 
That promise from you to receive; 
So surely you'll not break your word, love, 
And leave me your absence to grieve. 
So ril watch and I'll wait here still longer, 
In hope of your coming this way, 
When the dim, misty vail of the twilight 
Ilas shut out the brightness of day. 
By the lilies, ee.4. 
I 
Am Glad to See You, Boy. 
THERE is 
kindly greeting, we always love to hear, 
'Tis when our old friends wish us, ' Merry Christmas" once a 
year: 
But there 13 another greetin, I 
hear perhaps every day, 
'Tis when some old friend takes lily hand, and proudly seems to 
say: 
CHORUS. 
Pr.1 glad to sae you, boy; Fm glad to see you, boy, 
I 
feel so gay, when people say, I'm glad to see you, boy, 
Perhaps too we are courting, and some blue-eyed maiden fair 
Has won our heart, how gladly then to see her we repair; 
The door is quickly opened, and there stands our lit; le dear, 
Who greets us with a 
winning smile, and whispers in our ear; 
I'm glad to see you, boy, &c. 
The broker and the tax-collector seldom brings us joy, 
We do not often greet them with, I'm glad to see you, boy; 
But as they one and all are here, surrounding me to-day, 
Believe me, that I 
feel quite proud whenever I 
hear you say: 
I'm glad to see you, boy, ttc. 
I'M one of the jolliest dashing young blades 
'Twas ever your lot to observe— 
A 
boisterous, roving, dem' Jack cf all taloa`, 
fly no means deficient of nerve 
Eve travelled all over the country, you sec);\ 
So my breath it would not take away,; 
If some of you here were to recog::izo me, 
And politely come forward and say. 
CHOr.US; 
thin!: I 
have seen you before; 
I 
fancy I 
have seen you before; 
Your face seems to be so familiar to me 
That I 
fancy I 
have seen you before. 
Through life I've been neither too prond or too nice 
Though, of Cours, that's no business of Edno, 
And although the three-card trick's considered a 
vice 
'Twas a 
favorite hobby of mine— 
But last Epsom's races, while playing my game— 
Which I 
shall never do any more— 
A 
fel:ow came' up and requested my name 
re,r he fancied he'd seen me before. 
(Ho said) 
I 
think I 
have soon you Leoro, 
I 
told him that he was a 
stranger to me; 
But next moment I 
stared with surprise, 
When the fellow quite coolly informed me that he 
8 
Was a 
mounted police in disguise. 
Well, he took me in charge, locked me up for the night, 
And next morning I 
had to appear 
Before the old judge, who startled me quite, 
By mumbling these words in my ear: 
I 
think I 
have seen you before, &c. 
I 
politely informed the old gent he was wrong— 
For I 
never had been there before— 
When he warned me that I 
must not come out so strong, 
Or he'd certainly punished me more. 
The three-card trick game was then proved against me, 
Which I 
stoutly and firmly denied, 
But I 
made no impression, I 
plainly could see, 
For the magistrate coolly replied: 
CHORTJS. 
I've heard that old story before; 
I 
fancy I've seen you before; 
The tale seems to be so familiar to me, 
That I 
fancy I've heard it before. 
Well, he gave me three months, which my feelings annoyed, 
And in prison three months I 
did stay; 
Since which I 
have sworn lawless games to avoid, 
For I 
find that they don't always pay. 
So I 
turned comic singer, and nightly appear, 
To amuse and receive an encore, 
Yet folks everywhere, when my voice they do hear, 
Stjil fancy they've seen me before. 
They fancy they've seen me before, 1(,c.

THOMAS'S MACHINE. 
YOU all have heard of sewing machines, and all no doubt 
have seen, 
There's Wheeler & Wilson's, Wilcox and Singer's machines, 
But although I 
mention all these names, its none of these I 
mean 
The one I 
call attention to is Thomas's machine. 
• 
My wife begged me to buy her one, of course what could I 
do, 
I 
loved her, and I 
bought her one, but oh! that act I 
rue, 
For ever since we've had such rows, and such disgraceful 
scenes, 
And all through buying one of Mr. Thomas's machines. 
11011IIS. 
Oh, Mr. Thomas, if my agony you'd seen, 
You'd be sorry you invented that wonderful machine, 
For my peace and my happiness has never been seen, 
Since my Mary Jane began to work on a 
Thomas's ma-
chine. 
No sooner had I 
a 
thought, than to work she did begin, 
And all day long I 
had to hear that dreadful whirring din; 
I 
gently reprimanded her, and told her, my Mary Jane, 
If I 
had that noise too often, it would surely turn my brain. 
You must know that I'm an author, and by writing earn my 
bread, 
And to write well you want silence, and a 
cool collected head: 
So as any noise disturbed me, you can understand my spleen, 
When I 
had to write and listen to the whirr of that raacb4nc, 
Oh, Mr. Thomas, &e, 
At first I 
swore a 
little swear, and then I 
swore a 
big, 
And then I 
jumped about with rage, and almost danced a 
jig, 
But it never had the least effect, she worked away like steam, 
Sometimes she'd do a 
fiouuce or tuck, and then she'd do a 
seam. 
A 
feeling—the reverse of love, almost akin to hate— 
At last came over me, and I 
said, ray love we'll separate 
I'll take my books and papers to a 
spot calm and serene, 
Where I 
cannot be annoyed by Thomas's machine, 
Oh, Mr. Thomas, &c. 
It's two months since I 
left her, and I 
certainly must say, 
I 
regret the cause exceedingly, that made me go away, 
So mind you all take warning, now, by what you've heard 
and seen, 
And don't be over anxious for a 
Thomas's machine. 
Oh, Mr. Thomas, Sze. 
Sung with great success, by Tosit PASTott. 
TO what I 
hear about the town 
I 
give my close attention; 
The sayings that I 
hear about, 
To you I 
often mention. 
How great the rage for by-words now, 
It couldn't be greater, 
But the latest one that's come out is, 
Good-hye--I'll see you later, 
Each little boy upon the street, 
Of men an imitator, 
Will holler to a 
boy he'll meet, 
Good-bye—I'll see you later. 
The -other evening out I 
walked, 
My leisure time beguiling, 
'When into a 
saloon I 
dropped, 
And found the boys a " smiling." 
"Come, Tony, j' in us, have a 
drink 1" 
Cried one wild dissipator. 
Says I, " You'll just excuse me now, 
Good-bye—I'll see you later," 
They held me fast. 
I 
had to drink 
Till my spirits grew elator.'., 
And very soon I 
staggered out, 
With " Good-bye—I'll see you later." 
A 
pretty girl I 
met, her eyes 
A 
glance of love shot through me, 
And soon for supper we were bound, 
I 
thought, of course, she knew me. 
She drank so much, it really seemed 
'Twould soon intoxicate her; 
22 
Thinks I 
she'll break my pocket-book 
Before it gets much later. 
To my dismay I 
caught her soon, 
A-winking at the waiter, 
Saying, " Here's a 
flat!" Says I;" Enough. 
Good-bye—I'll see you later." 
They called on me to pay the bill, 
Which I'd no inclination, 
A 
policeman, then they soon 
To take me to the station; 
He called me, saying, "Come along, 
My swindling operator, 
And soon I'll have you in a 
cell. 
Then, good-bye—I'll see you later." 
33ut I 
tripped him up, and off I 
went 
As swift as any skater, 
And to the peeler hollered out, 
" 
Good-bye—I'll see you later." 
ought in 
I 
wandered home, and there my wife 
Commenced a 
curtain lecture, 
Says she, a 
nice hour you've come home, 
And what a 
looking picture. 
Of course I 
didn't have the heart 
To scold or irritate her, 
So says I, "Old woman, go to sleep, 
Good-bye—I'll see you later." 
So now I'll finish up my song, 
To you I've to cater, 
And if I've gained your kind applause, 
Good-bye—I'll see you later.

Go West, Young Man, Go West. 
AIR.—Carnival of Venice. 
THIS world it is filled full of trouble, 
As many a 
fellow well knows, 
What we get we all pay for just double 
What it's worth, and so the cash goes. 
I 
have heard there's a 
place where all, freely, 
Can live in luxurious rest, 
Take advice from the great Horace Greeley; 
" 
Go west, young man, go west." 
CHORUS. 
I 
have heard there's a 
place where all freely, 
Can live in luxurious rest, 
Take advice from the great Horace Greeley, 
" 
Go west, young man, go west." 
When your pocket-book loos like a 
wafer, 
And your boarding house bill is unpaid, 
When in dread of that old washerwoman 
To get out of doors you're afraid. 
When the soles of your shoes are transparent, 
And you long for a 
haven of rest, 
About that time the advice should be heeded 
"To go west, young man, go west." 
I 
have heard, kc. 
When the girl that you thought was a 
fairy, 
Shall tell you " to drop on yourself" 
And give you the shake and then marry 
A 
chap who should " be laid on the shelf," 
When you " tumble to" faro and keno, 
When policy you give a 
rest, 
Just say, " You'll be up in a 
minute," 
Then hand in your checks, and " Go West." 
I 
have heard, &c. 
I 
ONCE did love a 
yeller gal, whose name was Susy Brown, 
She came from Alabama, and was the fairest in the town; 
ner eyes so bright that they shine at night,. 
When the moon has gone away; 
She used to call this nigger up, 
Just afore the broke of day. 
With a " Who dat, who dat, who dat, who dat knocking at the 
door." 
SPOKEN.—"Am dat you, Sam, am dat you, Sam; 
" 
Why, Sam, ain't you gwine to MI' me in ?" 
"No, you'd better stop dat knockin' at the door,"— "let me in," 
"Stop dat knockin' "—" let me in," 
"Stop dat knockin' "—" let me in," 
"Stop dat knockin' "— "let me in, 
"Ah you better stop dat knockin' at my door."—"let me in," 
"Stop dat knockin', stop dat knockin', stop dat knock in'," 
"Stop dat knockin', oh! you better stop dat knockin' at my 
door." 
She was the handsomest gal dat eber I 
did see; 
SLe neber went out walkin' with any colored man but me, 
I 
took my banjo to the house, to play three times or more, 
When I 
heard two or three knocks pretty hard, 
Come bang, ag'ln the door.

BEAUTIFUL bird of spring has come,

Beaut;ful bird, come live with me. 
Come live with me, you shall be free, 
If you will come and live witla me,

You shall be all the world to me, 
Come, birdie, come and live with me. 
Ye little birds that sit and sing, 
Many a 
thought of loved ones bring, 
Hov'ring around your tiny nest, 
Calling your loved ones home to rest. 
Oh ! happy bird, no thought of care, 
No aching heart, no grief to bear, 
Over the land, over the sea, 
Come change your home and live with me. 
Come change your home, 
No more to roam. 
Come change your home. 
Come, birdie, come, &a 
Birdie, what makes you fly away, 
When I

I'll not deceive you, you are free, 
Now, bi;die fly, fast to the sky, 
To your sweet home, for night is nigh, 
And when the sun shines o'er the lea, 
Bring thy sweet mate and live with me. 
Then we will sing,

Then we will sing. 
Come, birdie, come, 
RING THE BELL SOFTLY 
SOME one has gone from this strange world of ours, 
No more to gather its thorns with its flowers, 
No more to linger where sunbeams must fade, 
Where, on all beauty, Death's fingers are laid. 
Weary with mingling life's bitter and sweet, 
Weary with parting and never to meet, 
Some one has gone to the bright golden shore 
Ring the bell softly, there's crape on the door: 
Ring the bell softly, there's crape on the door. 
CHORUS. 
Weary with mingling life's bitter and sweet, 
Weary with parting and never to meet; 
Some one has gone to the bright golden shore 
Ring the bell softly, there's crape on the door: 
Ring the bell softly, there's crape on the door. 
Some one is resting from sorrow and sin, 
Happy where earth's conflicts enter not in. 
Joyous as birds, when the morning is bright, 
When the sweet sunbeams have brought us their tight. 
Weary with sowing and never to reap, 
Weary with labor and welcoming sleep, 
Some one's departed to Heaven's glad shore ! 
Ring the bell softly, there's crape on the door: 
Ring the bell softly, there's crape on the door. 
Weary with mingling, th,

Loved ones have whispered that some one is blest,

Yes! there is one : nor.) in angelic bliss, 
One less to cherish, and one less to kiss, 
One more departed to Heaven's bright shore!

Ring the bell softly, there's crape on the door.

The Old Man's Drunk Again,1 
YOU'VE no doubt heard the song, 
Of " Father dear, come home," 
And the fate of hunzry little Ben, 
Who sent for him to come; 
now the old man used to " smile," 
And cause the family pain, 
But he let up for a 
little while, 
And then got drunk again. 
CHORUS. 
We've given him up for gone. 
Ile's lying in the lane, 
And almost every body know, 
The old man's drunk again. 
He takes his morning nip, 
And loafs about the door; 
Ile told his family more than once, 
That he would drink no more; 
But then he would forget 
From " benzine" to abstain, 
The police, they would come and say, 
" 
The old man's drunk again." 
We've given him up for gone, 
3. 
20 
He'd smash poor mother's nose, 
And upset brother Ned, 
And drive us all into the street, 
Then tumble into bed; 
And when he'd be asleep, 
We'd go back and remain, 
Until he woke and left the house, 
To come home drunk again. 
We've given him up for gone, cfcc. 
"0 ! Father, dear, come home," 
Stop drinking like a 
sow; 
You've drank away the beds and stove, 
Don't swallow up the cow; 
0 
I 
don't abuse the boys, 
And cause poor mother pain, 
Or we'll.rebel and " go for you," 
When you get drunk again. 
We've given him up for gone, &c.

Her smile was bright and gay, 
And loving was her glance! 
We wandered in the ' mall," 
We strolled beside the " lake ;" 
Her pretty hand so white and small 
Of course, I

We talked about the swans 
And all the other birds, 
I

She leaned upon my arm ; 
The sun went down the west, 
I 
tried in vain to whisper all 
The love within my breast!

-YOU'LL HEAR NO NOISE. 
Written by 3. F. 
SHERIDAN. 
HERE,we are, two merry boys, 
Full of life and fun, 
Singing, dancing, every night, 
When our work is done; 
The people everywhere we go, 
Call us their favorite boys, 
And when we sing and and dance for them, 
We never make a 
noise. 
CHORUS. 
Just watch the way we throw our feet., [sym.] 
Our dancing is so very neat, [sym.) 
Oh, ho --; 
we love to sing and dance, 
'Tis one of life's best joys, 
You can see our feet move up and down, 
But you'll never here a 
noise. 
To balls and parties we do go, 
And with the ladies flirt, 
Oh, ain't they nice young fellows, 
The girls they all aszert; 
The other gents get jealous 
And say we'er fast young boys, 
They envy us because we sing 
And dance without a 
noise. 
Just watch the way, &..e. 
I 
think there's some one calling us, 
So kind I. lends we must go 
We're sorry we must leave, 
But we've other work to do; 
When you come some other time, 
'You'll always find I1J boys, 
Ready to sing and dance for you, 
But you'll never hear a 
noise. 
Just watch the way, &a

SPEAK OUT LIKE A 
MAN, 
dung with the greatest success by JENNIE ENGEL. 
THOUGH you gentlemen are smiling, 
It's very plain to me, 
But most of you are single, 
Which of course ought not to be, 
There's girls I'm sure in plenty, 
Who would your happiness advance, 
By wedding'you to morrow 
If they only had a 
chance. 
CHORUS. 
Then don't be shy, for single life's a 
sin 
Fair lady as the proverb says, 
Faint heart did never win. 
Then don't be shy, but do the best you can, 
And when you go a 
courting 
Why, speak out like a 
man. 
When at your kind attentions, 
We appear to take offense, 
Pray don't be disconcerted 
That's merely a 
pretence. 
If to wring your ears we threaten, 
We of course mean no such thing, 
It's merely a 
suggestion, 
We ourselves should like a 
ring. 
Then don't be shy, ',Ica. 
Though we ladies are as sisters 
To the angels up above, 
Yet only whisper marriage, 
And we're gentle as a 
dove. 
To say " Yes" is very foolish, 
When the question popp'd may 
But "No" would be an answer. 
Much more silly you'll agree. 
Then don't be shy, 4te.

SHY, SHY, DREADFULLY SHY. 
HAD I 
been a 
monk or a 
hermit that dwelt 
In a 
cave where the world could not see, 
I 
then might be quiet, collected and cool, 
But fate has not will'd it to be; 
I'm thrown on the world with its troubles and trials, 
To avoid them I 
every day try, 
I'm nervous, fidgety, very reserved, 
In fact, I'm most awfully shy, 
I 
can't look a 
girl in the face, but I 
blush, 
For I 
feel most awfully shy. 
CHORUS. 
Shy, shy, shy, shy! 
Oh! I'm so shy— dreadfully shy, 
Shy, shy, shy, shy! 
I 
can't pass a 
stay shop, because I'm BO shy. 
Some people go to the theatre each night, 
To see actresses dress'd camme ilfaut, 
But I 
never will cast my eyes on the stage 
Unless the footlights they put low; 
There's the ballet girls too, so graceful to view, 
To see them is stretch'd ev'ry eye; 
To some this is good, but ' tis not to me, 
For I 
feel most awfully shy, 
Ballet girls' movements are all very wen, 
But I 
feel most wretchedly shy. 
'Cams. 
Shy, shy, shy, shy! 
Oh! I'm so shy— dreadfully shy, 
Shy, shy, shy, shy'. 
I 
would if I 
could, but I 
can't; Pm so .shy. 
For all I'm so shy, I 
once fell in love, 
To my sweetheart no question could pop, 
For hours I 
would sit by my loved one and say— 
Nothing! and then I 
would stop; 
She put the question, I, blushing, said "oe 
Got married—I 
felt I 
should die, 
To think of the future, tea:s came to my eyes, 
I 
felt so terribly shy, 
Vcs, to think et the future, tears came to my eyes, 
or I 
felt so uncommonly shy. 
CHORUS. 
Shy, thy, shy, shy: 
Oh! I'm so shy—dreadfully shy, 
Shy, shy, shy, shy: 
When I 
put on the ring I 
was awfully7;shy .

LOVELY and fair is my darling Patchoula, 
With eyes tender blue as mid summer's sky; 
She is my

The bloom on her cheeks will the roses outvie. 
She treats coldly my passionate ardor, 
Oh ! its then that I 
love her the harder, 
Though she says on her life she'll ne'er be my wife, 
Such a 
dear little witch is Patchoula.

Oh! beautiful, bewitching Patchoula, 
My dear little riddle Patchoula, 
She can fool me at will but I'll think of her still, 
My witching, my darling Patchoula. 
When I 
first saw Patchoula one bright summer morning. 
She stood by the side of her own, father's gate, 
The smile that she gave me had the spell of a 
charmer; 
'Twas then that I 
knew I 
had met all my fate, 
With her manners so bewitching and simple, 
Her cheeks are so roguish and dimpled; 
What care I 
for life if she'd by my wife, 
Cy own little darling Patchoula.

BIG AND THE LITTLE OF IT. 
Original by HARRIGAN Ac HART. 
First Lover. 
I'VE just arrived in town to day, 
To see the girl I 
love, 
She lives in yonder little cot, 
She is my turtle dove; 
I 
know I've got a 
rival, 
That comes here on the sly, 
I'm bound to have the girl you bet, 
At least I'm going to try. 
Cnonus. 
Oh, my, the girl she must be mine, 
With her Grecian bend stuck out behind, 
I'm bound to have the girl you know, 
The7fairest in the land, 
And I 
never will be satisfied, 
Until I 
take her hand. 
Second Lover 
I 
wonder who that feller was, 
He thinks he cuts a 
shine, 
He conies around the girl I 
love, 
And very soon I'll find; 
38 
He'd better quickly take a 
walk, 
On him I'll put a 
head, 
And send him home with his Ma, 
She'll put him right in bed. 
Oh, my, the girl, &c. 
Both. 
Oh, what's the matter ? excuse me, sir, 
What was you doing here ? 
Second I,orer. 
I 
came to court the girl I 
love, 
Now don't you interfere. 
First Lover. 
I'd interfere, just if I 
like, 
For you was now on time. 
Second Loren 
I 
reckon not if I 
know myself, 
She promised to be mine.

Originally Sung;by H ARRIGAN & H ART. 
OH kape your eyes on us now, 
We're twins as ye plainly see, 
The way that we suffer now, 
We'll expose it all to ye; 
Brought up on mush and milk, 
From small little babies, oh, 
We're the Mulcahey Twins, 
The pets of the ladies, oh. 
It took two hundred days ye know, 
To cross the big ocean, oh, 
The:ship she was tossing, oh, 
Wid awful commotion, oh ; 
We had nothing to ate, agrah, 
But oatmeal and praties, oh,

Ls sang by W. HARRY EVE, Eagland's Great Comic. 
WAS at a 
first-class eating house, not far from Maiden 
Lane, 
I 
used to dine and gaze upon the charming waitress, Jane, 
Such eyes, such teeth, such rosy cheeks, I'd never seen 
before, 
I 
never noticed what I'd eat, until I 
paid the score. 
SPOKEN.—And when I 
asked her what I 
owed, she'd say, 
in a 
most bewitching manner, well, let me see, what did you 
have? there was— 
CHORUS. 
Roast pork, boiled pork, pickled eels, and treacle tart, 
Suet pudding, sheeps head, a 
glass of sherry wine, 
Steak pie, pig's feet, saveloys, and bullock's heart, 
Together with the waiter makes a 
dollar forty-nine. 
I 
gazed on her, r 
squeezed her hand, the pressure was re-
turned, 
Oh joy, to think the flame of love within her bosom burned 
I 
used to go there every day, to gaze upon my dear, 
She'd steal a 
wicked glance at me, and whisper in my ear— 
Roast pork, boiled pork, &c. 
I 
met her out at night and used to take her to the play, 
She ruined my digestion ere she named the happy day, 
I 
said, oh Jane, my pretty Jane, my pet, my turtle dove, 
Come dwell with me by rippling streams, and learn to live 
on love. 
SPOKEN.—Live on love, she said, oh not for Jane, she 
prefers something more substantial, such as— 
Roast pork, boiled pork, &e.

Though to be called green,

Tho' foolish we look

CHORUS. 
Tho' our native land ' Gs green, 
Oh, that's no reason why, 
That we should be called the same, 
Remember that, me boys. 
'Twas not want nor starvation 
That brought us amongst you, 
As from our appearances 
That you can see. 
For at home we had plenty, 
'Tis the truth that I

But we longed for to see, 
This land of the free.

Betwixt daylight and morn,

Yes, we are an Irish pair, 
An Irish pair 
From the county of Kildare, 
At a

A fight or a

We're always to be found. 
Shure Old Ireland is the place, 
For a

We used to gather Buchu leaves, 
Buchu, Buchu, gather Buchu leaves, 
And when Massa Hembold came, 
He paid us for the same. 
CHORUS. 
This is what we used to do, 
Picking up the Buchu; 
We are happy Hottentots, 
Happy, happy, happy Hottentots, 
And from Africa we came, 
That's where we got our name. 
Every night when work is done, 
Day time, night time, always full of fun, 
In our cozy little cots, 
Us happy Hottentots, 
Sing and dance most all the day, 
Singing, dancing, pass the time away, 
All our troubles come and go, 
We send them down below. 
That is what, &c. 
As sung by EDDIE BAADY. 
YOUNG folks I 
come to sing a 
song, 
I'm old I 
won't detain. you long, 
I'm eighty four, you must know I 
am, 
And the young folks call tne grandfather Sam. 
My hair once black, has now turned gray, 
But what of that while I 
feel gay, 
I 
could sing a 
song and dance with glee, 
Oh if I 
was as young, as I 
used to be. 
CHORUS. 
Hipity, hipitv, hop de do, 
Oh how I 
love to sing for you, 
I 
could sing a 
soleand dance with glee 
Oh if I

used to be. 
When I 
was young I 
knew life's joys, 
But many sorrows hive come, my boys, 
My dear old wife, the joy of my life, 
I 
lost some twenty years gone by. 
I 
could tell a 
story ' twould broak your heart, 
But let all sorrow and grief depart, 
I'm a 
jolly old fellow as you can see, 
And I 
feel just as young, as I 
used to be. 
Hipity, hipity, & C. 
When I 
was young and in my prime, 
I 
was with the girls the most of my time, 
I'd take them out each day for a 
ride, 
And I 
always had one by my side. 
I'd hug and kiss them. just for fun, 
And I've prodosed to more than one: 
If there's a

kiss from me, 
She will find me as young, as I

First She Would and Then She Wouldn't. 
As sung with immense success by Master GEORGE A. 
M URRAY, 
the rising Young Comic. 
TO 
an eveninT party once I 
went and met such a 
nice young 
girl, 
Dressed oh, so fine and smothered in scent, my heart soon fell 
in a 
whirl, 
I 
asked her it she'd dance with me, she looked at me and smiled, 
She wouldn't say yes, she wouldn't say no, she'd quite a- pecu-
liar style. 
CHORUS. 
First she would and then she wouldn't, 
Then she smiled and said she couldn't, 
Then she said, oh George, you shouldn't, 
You're a 
naughty, naughty man. 
I 
sat down by the fair one's side and gave her wine and cake, 
I 
told her what I'd do and dare all for her own dear sake, 
She then looked up at me and smiled, I 
took that smile for bliss, 
And when the time for parting came, I 
tried to steal a 
kiss. 
SPOKEN.—Yes, ladies and gentlemen I, came very near doing 
it too, but she was one of those peculiar souls that— 
First she, &c. 
I 
thought it was time and so I 
had the business put on a 
spec, 
I 
sent my love a 
new silk dress her darling self to deck, 
Upon the wedding morn I 
called my intended bride to find, 
Not dressed at all and worst of all, she'd hadn't made up her 
mind. 
SPOKEN.—Yes and when I 
asked what she meant, she thought 
Lhat— 
First she, &c. 
Well after that we married were, and live pretty nice at home, 
There's one thing which my wife objects that's when I 
wish to 
roam, 
She says that home's the proper place for al good married 
men, 
And if I

THE DUBLIN DANCING MASTER. 
Sung by master B
ARNEY. 
IN Dublin city once there lived, 
A 
craythur gay an' hearty, oh! 
A 
dancin' master he by thrade, 
his name was Teddy ArCarthy, oh! 
He taught the girls and boys to dance, 
And none could do so faster— 
He always danced so nate and nice; 
Did this Dublin Dancin' master. 
CHORUS. 
With his down the middle! hands across! 
Go a 
little faster, oh, 
In an' out and round about 
The Dublin Darwin' masther, oh ! 
SPOKEN.—Mr. M'Carthy, allow me to inthroduce to yer notice, 
Mr. Cornelius Fitzpelthers Fitzfoozle O'Shaughnessy, a 
new pu-
pil. 
Och, how do you do, sir, you're a 
pupal' ve had in my 
eye for many a 
day, and I 
assure you, sir, you could not put 
yourself in better hands for the practice of your feet. 
This is 
something of your style of dancin' I 
presume sir? ( Dances a 
Spanish waltz.) Now, Sir, just thry that. (Imitates an awkward 
pupil.) 
Ah, sir, Fin afeard you'll nivir make a 
dancer; your 
legs are not fellows; however, I'll see if I 
can't cure you in time. 
Now Teddy taught both reels and jigs, 
And all the other dances, 
From Highland fling to plain quadrille, 
To please the ladies' fancies. 
Patsey Whelan, Mickey Flynn, 
And a 
boy called Kit McAsthor,

Highland fling 
From the Dublin dancin' masther.

Thus Teddy got the boys and girls, 
Proficient in their dances— 
Polkas, jigs and schottisches, 
Mazourkas, reels and lancers, 
No matter what the dance he taught, 
None could go it faster, 
And none conll dance an Irish jig, 
Like tl.e Dublin danein' masther. 
Down the middle, &a. 
SPOICEN.—Now leedies and gintlemin, teek your places for the 
next dance; you see how line you're gettin on. 
Our family 
were always celebrated for their dancin' propinsities ; my younj-
est son, although not as old as his eldest brother, could dance a 
jig before be was able to walk; and now for the next dance. 
(Dances Irish jig. ) 
End with Chorus.—Don the midclle.

BIDDY DOYLE'S DRAGOONS. 
Written and sung by THE FIELDINGs. 
I'M jolly Pat, the gunner, 
I'm Biddy Doyle, the drummer, 
On the ninth of last October, 
I 
enlisted like a 
man, 
And of him I 
made a 
private, 
In this, my female band. 
CHORUS. 
If you wish to join, 
Just fall in line, 
And march away while we bate the time, 
And don't we all, 
Then cut a 
shine, 
In Biddy Doyle's dragoons. 
In my regiment there's just nine, 
And seven of them are blind; 
Our enemy it is whiskey, 
We fight it every day, 
And it generally gets the best of you, 
That's just what I 
was going to say.

AWFULLY CLEVER. 
As sung by Miss Jennie Hughes, 
I've a 
fellah who does'nt like bothah, 
All trouble to him is a 
bore, 
lie's an income left him by his mothaw, 
What on earth could a 
fellah want more ; 
His favorite sport's killing time, 
his aim's to do nothing at all, 
While some in this world run and climb, 
He takes the trip easy and crawls. 
CHORUS. 
For they tell him he's awfully clevah; 
Oh, so clevah, deuced clevah, 
They say that they nevah, no nevah, 
Met a 
fellah, so clevah before. 
Some fellahs go in for the Army? 
And some fellahs go in for trade, 
But he hasn't such bores to alarm him, 
His fortune was already made. 
And some fellahs go in for brain, 
And scribble to earn an honest penny, 
Those fellahs deserve all their gains, 
As for brains he could do without any. 
in the park he is often seen driving, 
lie thinks he's Alexis, the duke, 
Whenever he goes in for billiards, 
lie thinks he's a 
hard one to fluke. 
Some times at an evening party, 
To keep us alive in he'll peep, 
Whenever we ask him to sing, 
We are certain to fail fast asleep,

CHO., 
ALL AMONG THE ROSES. 
Poetry and Melody by W . 
H. 
DELEHAVIT. 
IN an Ivy-covered cottage, 
Hidden back of oaken trees, 
Lives a 
lovely little maiden, 
Blythe and happy as you please. 
Where upon a 
low veranda, 
Every summer's eventide, 
I 
sit amid the flowers fair 
Camillia by my side. 
All among the roses, 
Making sweet proposes— 
Lovely, laughing, soul bewitching, 
Sweet Camillia May; 
Captivating, aggravating, 
Never tired of play— 
Flitting like a 
little birdie, 
Happy, light and gay; 
Kill me or I'll die with love 
For sweet, Camillia May. 1 
There's a 
pretty white camel's., 
Ever glowing in her hair, 
Lovely violets and roses 
Blooming in her face so fair; 
Little stars and merry sunshine 
In her eyes so bright and gay, 
And a 
choir of angels singing 
In the voice of Milly May. 
All among, .tc. 
Now forget not to remember, 
When in love you chance to be, 
Try and keep in all your feelings 
Not act foolishly like me; 
For I 
live on, hoping, dreaming, 
Of a 
coming joyous day, 
When I'll make of one Camillia 
Such a 
lovely sweet bouquet. 
All among, dkc.

I 
KNOW a 
little yellow gal, named Anne Eliza Jane, 
I 
love her to distraction, and Eve got her on the brain, 
Such a 
blushing sylph of sweetness, I 
know you'd never meet, 
She's pretty as a 
picture, from her head down to her feet, 
CHORUS. 
Anne Eliza Jane, your sweet as sugar cane, 
Anne Eliza Jane, your sweet as sugar cane, 
I 
love you to distraction, and Eve got you on the brain, 
The first time that I 
met my love, ' twas going down Broadway, 
With all her fancy fixings on, she looked so neat and gay, 
When dandy barber Jim passed by, you'd ought to hear her laugh 
would have given live dollars then, to have her photagraph, 
Anne Eliza, SLc. 
I'll marry Anne Eliza Jane, and settle down in life, 
I 
know I 
will contented be, with such a 
pretty wife, 
On our wedding night the bones and tambo we shall ring, 
And the fiddle join the chorus, while the darks all gaily sing,

A Beautiful Cloth Cult Volume. 
Read what two leading New York papers say of it. 
The New

A 
little book has lately appeared in print at Messrs. F;sher & 
Denison's, 08 Nas,au street, ended " The Little Flirt." We 
cannot 
J- 
Exi that we recommend it to our young lady and gentlemen readers, 
as we think it would only encourage the bad habit of " flirting." 
Unfortunately there is enough of it done without any l'urther neces-
sity of expiaining "how, when uric: where to do it," and this little 
volu ale would advise and initiate the uncorrupted in practising what 
is commonly called " flirting." 
The N. Y. Evening Telegram writes: 
We 
have lately seen a 
neat little book, bound in morocco, costing 
25 cents, ca'led "The Little Flirt," published by Messrs. Fisher & 
Denison 98 Nassau street. 
It gives information of the modus oper-
andi of flirting, and of the meaning of every motion of the hand-
kerchief, fan, glove and parasol. As there is nothing at all objec-
tionable in the volume, and its contents might afford some innocent 
amusement to many, we do not hesitate to recommend it to our 
young lady and gentlemen readers. 
The LITTLE FLIRT contains Fourteen Silhouette Illus-
trations.

to those who have never perused the sad story of CrwiLoTrii 
TEMPLE;joyed with her in her early pleasures, sympathised and 
wept with her in her sorrows, mad glowed with indignation at the 
wrongs which she suffered from base, calculating villains, an oppor-
tunity is afforded of reading one of the most absorbing works ewe 
written, proving " truth stranger than fiction." 
The poet's lines are but a 
just description of the unfortrnats 
Charlotte Temple: 
Her form was faultless, and hec mind. 
Untainted yet by art, 
Was noble, just, humane and kind, 
And virtue warmed her heart. 
But, ah ! the cruel spoiler eame--" 
This book, in the language of Mrs. Rowson, " affords a 
striking 
example that vice, however prosperous in the beginning, in the 
end leads only to misery arid shame.
