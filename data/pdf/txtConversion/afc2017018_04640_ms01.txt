I: 
Okay. We’re on. So, the first thing I want to do is say thank you, M, and for N, no a. 
M: 
Yes. 
I: 
For being here and agreeing to this interview, and also thank you for the work that you’re doing 
because we believe that the personal caregiving that you’re doing is so valuable and important especially right 
now with the population aging, and as you were talking about earlier, everybody’s going to need healthcare. 
M: 
Everybody. 
I: 
So, the work that you’re doing I believe is really valuable, and we want to use this opportunity to let 
other people know about what you’re doing. I think part of the resistance we get or the challenges to helping 
this workforce is because people just don’t know, understand, what it is you do. 
M: 
Yes. 
I: 
They don’t understand what you make possible, so this is a chance to sort of let people know what your 
work is all about, and why you believe it’s valuable, and why we should be paying attention to this. So, thank 
you. 
V: 
Thank you for the opportunity. This is like you say, we’ve done a lot of talking and communicating with 
the community—family members, friends [1.25.28]. This is the first time we’ve had a platform to reach the 
public, and it’s so important, and I’m thankful to be here and still be able to continue making homecare better. 
Our work conditions are horrible. 
I: 
Tell us about that. 
V: 
To be told you’re insignificant because you care about people, that’s heartbreaking. 
M: 
Mmm hmm. You’re just the butt wiper. 
V: 
You know, you’re caring for people that nobody else, no other, you know, nurses don’t do this, 
therapists don’t do this. We’re healthcare professionals, and we love our job. I love my job. I wasn’t into—my 
career of choice actually was to become a computer technician. I wanted to rebuild and troubleshoot 
computers, maybe get into the media, you know, computers at that time—graduating in 1983 from high 
school—I jumped on board. I wanted to be a technician. You know, I wanted to keep up with the times, and I 
was a teenage mom. I had two kids in high school. My mother was there for me. She made sure I finished 
school, and once I started going to school for—studying for my A-plus certification, somewhere in the middle 
after graduation she was getting slower, not being able to do the things that she loved to do so much because I 
watched her growing up take care of everybody. She was the ultimate caregiver. She would talk to people she 
didn’t even know. When I was little she be havin’ a conversation with a stranger, and I’m like, momma, who is 
that? And she’s like, “I don’t know.” Like, what are you doin’? You’re talkin’ to you, you know, it was just I 
learned from the best, and because, you know, when she told me growin’ up, “If I’m ever not able to take care 
of myself, please don’t put me in a facility.” And I honored that. I honored her with that. It started with not being 
able to cook, then not being able to care for herself, personal hygiene, to where she lived a powerful, spirit-
filled, I mean just an honorable woman ‘til 2014 [1.22.33]. She passed away. She was 88, so I was there 2005 
when homecare workers decided like, we’re not invisible anymore. We’re not gonna take this anymore. We’re 
not gonna accept those pennies. We demand respect. We demand dignity. Where, you know, we got results. 
We were very successful in organizing training centers and people who wanted their GED to people who want 
to be certified nurses’ assistants, and I mean I have so many victories. I can just go on and on. 2008 
registering 98% of Michigan to vote and voted for President Obama. 
M: 
Mmm hmm.

V: 
Just all over the world, and this is so heartbreaking to be not recognized as a professional, not a job, 
because a job is just over. But it is a job because we’re just over-broke, under-broke. How do you have to be 
told that you have to make a decision on buying your kids some shoes or putting food on the table. Like we’ve 
been put in such a low-class of just not being recognized as professionals, and I’m like we’re champions in 
homecare. We are the champions, and we were fighting then. We are still speaking out, and we will continue to 
speak out. 
M: 
That’s right. 
V: 
We will continue to let it be known that homecare workers are important. If you don’t take care of this—
if you don’t recognize homecare workers now, then who’s gonna take care of you? Your future? You need us. 
You need us for those people that say, if they’re gonna be so stubborn, and so you know—but it’s their choice 
to say I wanna stay at home [1.19.56]. I wanna live in my home. I wanna be around my family. You know, if my 
days are coming shorter and I lived my life, I wanna be around my family. They should have that choice, and 
they have that choice, it’s just—it’s so much confusion and chaos with it when it could just be so smooth, and 
homecare can grow to be that very powerful community that’s gonna heal this nation. I really do believe that. 
We need homecare to make the community stronger. United, we’re stronger. We know this. 
M: 
Mmm hmm. 
V: 
We’re trying to get that out to people who don’t know it. They don’t understand that we’re stronger 
together. We accomplish more together. We may have different stories, but the bottom line we want the same 
things, and so that’s why I’m grateful to be here. I thank you for having us because I mean I didn’t wanna 
tear—I’m trying not to tear up because it’s so— 
M: 
Passionate. 
V: 
Yeah. And it hurts. It hurts really, really bad when they pay—at the time when my mother started—
when I started as a caregiver that was in ’99, and the pay was $5.15 an hour. 
M: 
Mmm hmm. 
V: 
And at that time, she could still get around. We could still go out and still have lunch and still do things. 
That was $5.15 an hour, but it was only for 20 hours a month. Mind you I still had two kids. I had my whole 
family. I had my own house, so for me to make sure my kids were safe, and my mom was safe and continue to 
go to school and take on temporary jobs. I mean I thank God. It was not easy. That was a difficult time. I mean 
I cried a lot, I prayed a lot, you know, and then when I met people like M who was I mean put your foot down. 
We’re not gonna take it anymore [group laughter]. We done. It’s over with. We’re not takin’ this anymore. It was 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Manila Freeman and Varnette Mahone. 7.5.18

easy [1.17.32]. It got easy. We had a family, and I’m just grateful that somebody thought enough to say, “Hey 
you guys, you wanna organize? Do you wanna come together and build this,”—at that time it was a union, but 
like I said being from a union home, I knew what unions were at that time, workin’ in union jobs. I knew what 
that meant, that the workers have a chance to talk about working conditions, better working conditions, terms 
of, you know, employment. If I’m gonna come and—because homecare is so different, we’re going through 
insurance companies, and the state is mandating how those dollars are being issued out. For you to say a 
nursing home where—that even that staff, we organized with nursing home workers. They’re working 20 
patients, 1 person. One person to 20. No one can do that. It’s in-human. It’s not possible. It’s not humanly 
possible for 1 person to take care of 20 persons, so that in itself is a holler. A homecare worker does to your 
home, they’re there with you, they monitor you, it’s not a 9 to 5. We’re there, call me on the phone. Hello, yes, 
how you doin’? You know, we’re companions. We’re your loved ones. Even if you’re not a family member, you 
become our family because we care about you. Not, I’m gonna come in and wash your dishes, and I’m gonna 
do your laundry, and then bye. It’s not like that. We become attached to you, and like I don’t understand how 
homecare is not recognized as a profession when you recognize your therapist who deals with your physical 
body and your mental state, we deal with the whole body. We deal with the whole person. For you to put out—
what’s this, like in the ‘60s, ‘70s, for a person to be recognized to build automobiles to say you deserve this, 
and we’re gonna give it you. Oh, this is great, great, great, and they’re happy. Why can’t we, dealing with 
humans, your family, your mothers, your fathers, if you have a 9 to 5 and you work and you call me, “V, I need 
you to come in and take care of my mom just until I get off work.” Just that little bit means so much, and like I’m 
grateful to be here. I’m so thankful [1.14.27] that, like I say, we were there in the beginning. We’re here now, 
and we will continue until homecare is known worldwide. 
I: 
And let’s do it. M, can you share a little bit of your background? Thank you, V, for saying— 
V: 
Thank you.  
I: 
--how you got, you know, from the beginning to now, how you got into this field. But share, M, a little bit 
about your background. You were an educator, a GED specialist. 
M: 
I’m still an educator no matter what. 
I: 
Yes. Once an educator, always an educator. 
M: 
There’s a song in my head that we used, and my mother used it, my father used, that my ancestors 
used that in the ‘60s they used, Dr. King used it that goes something like. Ain’t gonna let nobody turn me 
around, turn me around, turn me around. Ain’t gonna let nobody turn me around. My eyes is focused on the 
prize. That is the cry of the homecare workers. 
V: 
Mmm hmm. 
M: 
We’re gonna—my position is I have come through a lotta storms and watching how America has 
dropped the ball when it has come to taking care of our—doing homecare for our citizens and our people and 
our loved ones. I don’t think that it has become priority, or if it has become priority, it is so big of a problem they 
don’t know. No one has tried to harness it. I don’t know if it’s financial. I don’t know if it’s educational or the lack 
there of, of both of them, but it is a much needed, should I say entity or not. We have the baby-boomers. I am a 
baby-boomer, and this population is in need of homecare especially those that don’t want to go into a facility. A 
homecare worker on the average is paid between a minimum wage of $7.25 to $10.25 dependin’ on what state 
you’re in, and that averages out closely, roughly, forgive my math, maybe about $400 or $500 every 2 weeks 
or $800 to $900 once a month. Well, a facility, if you placed your loved one in a facility because you can’t find a 
homecare worker, the facility is gonna get between $4,000 to $5,000 to take care of that person. We have so 
many disabled Veterans living on the streets. We have a lotta people that did—were middle class living on the 
streets. We have our immigration population living on the streets. They need homecare [1.10.45]. We all are

going to need—we keep livin’, and somethin’ happened to you, you’re gonna need homecare of some kind. 
What do we do? Where do we go? How do we get the people to do these jobs when the people that want to do 
the jobs are constantly being belittled, disenfranchised, disrespected— 
V: 
Disrespected. 
M: 
--and not payin’ their worth to do the job. I was thrown into homecare. My brother was a disabled 
Veteran, and he suffered—about 29 years ago he suffered a major aneurism. He did not want to go into a 
nursing facility or home. I said, well, I’ll take care of him. There was an agency I didn’t know had already signed 
him up and made me the homecare worker. Fine! I did the duties, and then the check came. I’m looking at the 
check, and I’m looking at the services that I rendered towards my brother—I was gonna do it regardless 
because he was my brother, and we was always taught to take care of one another [1.09.14], but I saw how 
small the check was, and for the duties of helping him to make sure he could do his personal needs, feeding, 
staying on the special diet, lifting, helping him to walk, going getting his medication, running him back and forth 
to the doctors. I had a full-time job, I was working part-time, my son was in school, my mother had moved in 
with me, and I had moved my brother who, at that time, couldn’t do hardly anything for himself, moved in. So, 
someone knocked on my door from the union and asked me did I wanna be part of the union? In my mind I 
wanted to follow the money trail. If I’m doin’ all of this for my brother, where’s the money goin’? Who’s givin’ 
this money, and why aren’t the funds leveled off? Why aren’t the funds equaling the care? I got a rude 
awakening. I started meeting other homecare workers, and I was asking questions. I’m saying, how much do 
you make? “I only make $7.25.” “I only make $5.00.” It began at $5.00, then it went up to $6.00, then it went up 
to $7.25. And how many hours do you work? “Well, I have a client—I have six clients. I work 40 to 50 hours a 
week.” And I’m going something has to be done. What’s happening here? That is why I’m on a mission to 
continue working with the homecare workers, to be a homecare worker, and to see why can’t a homecare 
worker get as much pay as any other healthcare profession because they’re doing the same kind of work, but 
in a different capacity.  
V: 
The setting is different. 
M: 
Yeah. If I hadn’t had a career myself—oh, I’m sorry. If I hadn’t had a career myself, I could not have 
survived on $5.00 or $7.25. That could have not been my only income. 
V: 
No. 
M: 
Not with the bills and the services I have rendered towards my brother. I have noticed that when—if 
you’re not in a facility this is the problem, then you don’t get the respect, and there’s two—that’s a political 
problem because we found out that facilities—the owners of facilities were paying the politicians to block 
homecare workers from getting raises that weren’t in a facility. Am I right? 
V: 
That’s right. 
M: 
I’m not scared to say it [1.05.37]. So, then the politicians are in the pockets of the facilities blocking the 
workers, and that’s not a good thing. 
I: 
Tell us what’s happened since 2004? You said in 2004 you organized, you made a lot of progress on—
we only have a few minutes until we’re gonna switch over, but what’s happened since 2004 because I know 
you’re discouraged. 
M: 
Well, we became a right-to-work state. 
I: 
What year was that? 
M: 
That was—what was? 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Manila Freeman and Varnette Mahone. 7.5.18

V: 
That was 2000—this is what, ’17, that must have been 2012 when President Obama—it was his last 
year in office. 
M: 
The homecare workers we’re going—especially the ones that weren’t in facilities were going through 
the state to get paid. Those that had been registered on the registry, that has been knocked out. They were 
paying taxes. Taxes was taken outta their pay. They were paying into the social security fund. It was a job. A 
lotta that has now been taken away. A lotta the privileges that every worker has—the homecare workers 
privileges were taken away, benefits were taken away, health benefits, retirement benefits, social security 
benefits—can’t pay into the taxes benefit. Jobs has been sliced [1.03.43]. 
I: 
That’s been at the state level? 
M: 
Yes. 
I: 
With Governor Snyder’s— 
M: 
Yes. Snyder, Engler, all of ‘em. 
I: 
--right-to-work decisions. 
V: 
Yeah, but before then—yeah, because like 2004/2005 we were under the impression that we could 
organize a union. That was not true. We, basically let SEIU negotiate and talk for us when it should have been 
the other way around. We were never at any negotiations, never talked to any—well, lobby day, you know, 
we’ll go up and we’ll sit, and we’ll talk to our, you know, congress and state reps of that nature, but were never 
given— 
M: 
Representation. 
V: 
--representation for being organized. 
M: 
You could pay your union dues—union dues was taken out, but if you weren’t with a facility, you weren’t 
gonna get representation, and that was the problem. Okay. You’re sayin’ I’m in a union, I’m not gettin’ 
representation because I’m not in a facility, and that was brought—that was why a lotta the people started 
sayin’, “Well, I’m not payin’ union dues if you’re not representing me.”  
V: 
And we were talkin’ about 55,000—that was starting out, 55,000 in Michigan decided, yes. We want 
this. Like I’m sayin’ under the impression that we were gonna be a union. Well, once we found out that that 
was not possible because actually we are contractors of the state. But because the state have written in these 
clauses and different—made it this—so confusing that being successful like I said, we organized; we paid our 
dues. We were able to start a committee. It’s called COPE—a Committee on Political Education. That’s gone. 
We were able to start the training center [1.01.11], further your education, building, you know, members. You 
know, member organizing. We had a boot camp for instructing members or training members. How to member 
organize, how to political organize. That’s gone.  
M: 
So, in essence what’s happening is it’s just like homecare workers don’t exist any longer. They know 
they’re out there. They know they’re doing the job, but they don’t have representation, and that is where the 
distrust of the citizens come in. They’re no longer trusting the state. That’s why we have so many people 
calling in asking, “Do you know anyone that can help me out? Do you know an agency or someone that could 
come and help me clean my house without me going through this agency or that agency?” There are so many 
people working under the table, as you said, without being recorded because of the—it’s so much confusion. 
Not inclusion, but confusion as to where they stand as a homecare provider or homecare worker. There are 
people taking care of their mothers and fathers, which they wanna do today. That’s part of their upbringing, 
that’s part of their life, but they have never received a dime for it.

V: 
And then, you know, for homecare workers any—I mean MacDonald’s, if you work for a year any job 
that I know of—if you worked a year or 2 years, you get a vacation, or you get that time off—that paid time off. 
We get sick or we get hurt or we get injured, we don’t have anybody to cover for us. We had that. We had a 
respite care—a pool of homecare workers. You know, I’ll go in if you have something to do that day. You know, 
we worked together. They’re trying to block it because it’s so powerful—the nature of a homecare worker, just 
the heart of a homecare worker is just so caring, so giving that they want that to be eliminated because the 
more money—the money that we organize, and the money that we worked with, especially on political 
education, the more dollars we put out, they tripled dollars to cut it back. 
M: 
Mmm hmm. 
V: 
So, if we want to go to a nursing and help that nursing home, speak with that administration, and say 
listen, you need to add more nurses on your staff because this is inhumane. Like no one can do the job what 
you’re paying them to do [57.47]. It’s not the pay. Sometimes it’s not always the pay. It’s just like you just don’t 
care. 
M: 
Yeah. 
I: 
We’re gonna have to pause just for a moment so K can swap his batteries out, but I’m gonna keep 
talking. 
M: 
[Laughing] okay.  
I: 
We just pulled some of these really, really important thoughts just for a couple of minutes, and I wanna 
assure that this is—I hope, I hope this is just the beginning of our conversation. 
M: 
Oh, sure. 
V: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
When this project is over, we can all continue to talk, and I hope to bring other people into it, so we can 
get this going again. 
V: 
Yeah. 
M: 
There also was a part in that—see my thoughts are coming— 
V: 
[inaudible] 
M: 
Right. I may seem a little scattered, but there’s so much that we have gone through that you can’t say it 
in one or two— 
V: 
There’s so much. 
M: 
And then we have our bilingual community [56.41]. 
V: 
Community, yes. 
M: 
We had—if it hadn’t been for us knocking on doors for President Obama—we had to go into the 
Hamtramck District, and in the Hamtramck District, I guess your Mooslim or Muslim pop—if I said it right, 
population, there were some women— 
I2: 
I’m ready if you guys want— 
I: 
Oh, okay. Let’s start that story over. 
M: 
Okay. All right.  
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Manila Freeman and Varnette Mahone. 7.5.18

I: 
You goin’? All right. There are so many questions I have. There is no way we’re gonna get through all 
of these questions and your ideas. I mean this is big. 
V: 
But this can be Part 1. 
I: 
This is Part 1. 
M: 
It can be Part 1 [laughs]. 
I: 
And I wanna get to the most important questions right now, but let’s just hope that this conversation 
continues. 
V: 
Okay. Then. 
I: 
And you were just talking, M, about collecting your thoughts, and you know. 
M: 
Getting my thoughts—there’s so much out—I have to organize my thoughts. We have the Hmong 
population, we have our Hispanic population, we have our Muslim population, we have— 
V: 
Latino. 
M: 
--Latino, Arabic. I don’t wanna say the wrong word to offend anybody. We even have our Black 
population. You have to know the diff—if you’re gonna be a homecare worker, you have to know their 
traditions— 
V: 
There’s a language barrier. 
M: 
--besides the language barrier--to give them help. We were knocking on doors for President Obama’s 
campaign, and I’m proud to say he was my President. 
V: 
Yes. 
M: 
And we went into Hamtramck, and for those homecare workers that didn’t know—there were people 
that really needed help. Women that needed help, but they couldn’t talk to us because their husbands or 
brothers—the male of the house, head of the home, was not there to talk to us about that. And then we 
couldn’t talk back because we didn’t know the language [54.17]. So, we had to start—there was a young lady 
and a young man came to our meetings, and they joined, and they started a unit for the ones in Hamtramck 
that couldn’t speak the language, that didn’t understand who we were and for them to express the need and 
how to fill out the paperwork if they needed a homecare worker or if they needed a hospital worker or someone 
to come into their homes to help out. They didn’t understand that service, and it’s the same thing in certain 
parts of Detroit where it might be a gang activity situation where you cannot go down that street. If you are a 
stranger in that neighborhood, you can’t go down that street if you don’t have a sign sayin’ I’m your homecare 
worker or there’s a family worker to say I’m in this home to give you homecare. That is a reality that the 
politicians don’t understand. We are a diverse community, but you have to understand the traditions and the 
culture of the community in which you’re serving and giving them help, and that is lacking. 
I: 
I’ve explained beforehand, we had a little conversation that this is part of the Archie Greene project. 
Archie Greene was very interested in capturing the stories of the everyday lives of American workers, and his 
hope was that through interviews like this the public, the politicians, everybody would have a better 
understanding of what it’s like to be a homecare worker, what your lives are like. You know, what is the culture 
of the homecare worker? Can you talk a little bit about that? 
V: 
I mean I love it. I love homecare. It’s an independent job. It’s an independent profession. I work on my 
own terms. You know, I’ve had up to eight clients. None were bedridden, you know, they just needed a little 
extra help [51.44]. Collectively I would get their grocery lists, go to the grocery store, shop for everybody, drop

everybody food off. You know, I remember this lady, Miss R, it was an apartment building that’s why it was so 
easy. My fiancé, before we—well, he’s passed away, but before we were married he lived in a senior’s 
complex, and through him they, “Oh, she’s a care worker. You know, she’s a caregiver. You know, you need 
some help,” [laughing] and that’s how I got, you know, started like that. Even with taking care of my mom 
because my mother had family like all around her. It was just the fact that I was the primary caregiver. I was 
the—you know, she wouldn’t talk to—if she was in pain or something was wrong, nobody would know it. It was 
like we had this connection together. Certain things she would say or the look in her face, I could look and say, 
oh, ma, you know, you’re not looking like—you know, come on let’s just go. “I don’t wanna go. I don’t wanna 
go.” She didn’t want to go to the hospital, but because of her condition if infection had set up it could get to her 
bloodstream, and so I would have to catch it. Get her to the hospital, get antibiotic ‘cause she was allergic to 
penicillin, so we would have to get her to the hospital, get in there, have her worked out, get that infection 
before it gets in her bloodstream ‘cause she almost passed away once before that. So, that’s why I was so like 
had to be near her all the time. I just, like, okay, ma. I could talk to her on the phone, I could hear it in her voice 
[49.56]. So, she was, “You don’t have to watch me all the time,” you know [laughs]. She’s still very strong-
willed woman, at that time, so— 
I: 
V, that’s such a great story. We talk about the language. I know I’ve talked to both of you on the phone. 
You’re both very, very serious about what a homecare worker should be called. 
V: 
Yes. 
I: 
And more important the languages, and just a butt wiper. I have a hard time with saying just a 
companion. 
V: 
Yeah. 
I: 
Because a companion, you might just be sitting there passing the time, you know, providing some 
social interaction— 
V: 
Yes. 
I: 
--going to get the groceries, all of that stuff, but you just described this situation where you were a 
companion, but you’re actually observing. You’re on all the time. 
V: 
Oh, yeah. All the time. 
M: 
You have to be. 
I: 
Changes in status, and when you see a change in status you’re making life and death decisions on the 
spot. 
M: 
Exactly. 
V: 
Right then. Yeah. 
I: 
So, when you called that companion work, that’s kind of an understatement, wouldn’t you say? 
V: 
Very. Yeah. That is like—that’s why I say to be told that you’re—you say marginalized. You know, 
you’re insignificant— 
M: 
Right. You’re just yeah. 
V: 
--you’re just—you know, you’re nothing. Like, how—it’s like, how do you feel? These people that are 
doing this, these people that are actually so mean—

M: 
Are people in facilities. 
V: 
--how are you dealing with your family members? Like, how is your family life? That’s what I would think 
first [48.11]. Like, how was it when you was growing up? Like, were you abused or, you know, because you’re 
not showing compassion for people who are, you know, living their lives. They worked their job. They raised 
their kids. They’re getting older now, or even a person with a disability, you get into an accident and something 
happens to you in your prime—your 40, 50-year’s old. So, now I’m just gonna sit here and just die? Like, no. 
You have to be able to, you know, care about people! 
M: 
But that’s the fear-factor that they—when you hear things like this, the fear-factor has been put in other 
workers to say that about homecare workers because they are in fear of losing their status or their job titles or 
their livelihood as— 
I: 
Who’s they? 
M: 
The facilities. We have a fight against people in facilities and hospitals. We had one union—one high up 
union person, she was the secretary-treasurer of the Homecare Workers Union, would tell all the homecare 
workers you all are nothin’—and I take her on face-to-face personally. I’m never scared of that. She would 
embody the spirt of putting homecare workers down. Why? Because she was continually getting a check from 
facilities. Instead of— 
V: 
They’re making good money. 
M: 
--instead of checks from the state, and as we talk right now, there is an apartment buildin’ full of seniors 
and people that have disabilities who do not have fans, who’s water is probably turned off or it’s getting ready 
to be turned off. They’re begging for homecare workers or someone to come up in there to help them out. I 
could take you to two or three buildings where the people are begging for homecare providers. Someone to 
come in. They don’t meet the qualifications of homecare through the Area Council on Aging, and I’m gonna put 
it out there. Because they only can do so much, and there aren’t any other agencies picking up the bill. Area 
Council for the Aging—Detroit Area Council on Aging—funds were cut, so you have to be immobile in order to 
really get the services. There are people that are starving [45.17] for meals, and if I was up in that building I 
would—what is it?  
V: 
Meals-on-wheels. 
M: 
Meals-on-wheels have been cut back. We’re talkin’ about young mothers who are disabled, and their 
children are in need. We’re talkin’ disabled Veterans, so when we’re talkin’ about the—it’s the whole—we have 
to include the entire population for help in homecare. We have so many people—I could walk up two or three 
blocks and say I’m a homecare worker, do you know anyone in your family on this street, at our church, at your 
community center that needs someone to help someone out? “Yes, but we don’t want to tell on’ em, or we 
can’t trust that they gonna get paid, or we don’t know anybody.” 
V: 
Yeah. Because they’re gonna go in— 
M: 
It’s the fear— 
V: 
--to [inaudible] lives and say, “Oh, well— 
M: 
--fear-factor. 
V: 
Say I had four all my life. I retired. “I need a homecare worker.” “Oh, you made too much. You can’t get 
that.” Okay. So, I was a teacher, and now I’m—I need a caregiver. “Oh, well, you’re getting your social security, 
and you’re getting your pension, you’re getting too much. You can’t get that.”

M: 
What is that term? 
V: 
So, you have to be either— 
M: 
It’s that gray area. 
V: 
--no—you basically have to be super poor. Like, just social security, maybe $500 a month, and then 
that might be too much. 
M: 
That might be too much. 
V: 
--if you own your home. So, then what are you doing with that $500? Okay. Well, I pay my gas, I pay 
my taxes, I pay my insurance. Okay. That’s--$500 is not enough for that. Okay, but then say you don’t pay 
your—you can’t pay your taxes, so your taxes aren’t paid, your insurance isn’t paid, but you pay your lights and 
your gas. So, you got $30 left over. That’s too much. You can’t get it. 
M: 
Right. It’s such a big social issue. 
V: 
It’s ridiculous. 
M: 
And that’s what I said, it’s catastrophic. This is a—it is so big of an issue, and I’m glad that somebody is 
recognizing, tryin’ to do something, but as we sit here and talk, there are masses of people in need of [42.30] 
homecare help. 
V: 
Yes. 
M: 
These are jobs. You sayin’ people don’t wanna work, yes, they do. 
V: 
Yes, they do. 
M: 
You sayin’, are they workin’? Yes, they are. 
V: 
Yes, they are. 
M: 
It’s better to work and do somethin’ than not to work and do nothin’, but as you’re working, you gotta 
help make a change. You know, this is bigger than the war on poverty. You know, that’s where the people are 
talkin’ now—war on poverty. There’s always been poverty. There’s always been wars, you know, drug wars. 
We always havin’ wars of some kind. This is a healthcare war. 
V: 
And they’re looking at those—even we was like we don’t wanna call ‘em clients, and we don’t wanna 
call them employers— 
M: 
Consumers— 
V: 
They’re our consumer. It was like— 
I: 
What do you want to call them? 
M: 
People in need of help [laughs]. 
V: 
Yeah. We take care of people. 
M: 
The human race [laughs]. 
V: 
It’s like— 
I: 
So, help me understand. I’m general public. I don’t really get it. Help me—you’ve just told me you’re a 
companion.

Manila Freeman and Varnette Mahone. 7.5.18

M: 
Not me. I’m a homecare worker. I’m not gonna be—I’m gonna work with you [laughs]. 
I: 
Okay. You’re a homecare worker who’s providing companion services, is that what you’re gonna say? 
V: 
So, what a homecare worker is to me— 
M: 
Companion service is a little more than—I mean companion service mean I’m just there. I’m gonna take 
you to the store. We gonna go somewhere. I’m providing your entire healthcare, so I’m providing a certain part 
of healthcare that the doctors and the nurses and no one else want to provide [40.34]. 
I: 
But even if, human being that you’re taking—helping out—taking care of—even if they don’t require 
total care and your main role for that particular person is being a companion, there’s so much more to that 
word. 
M: 
Exactly. 
I: 
I mean for example, the story you told earlier about needing to be vigilant, watching for status changes, 
but you told a story that really struck me, ‘cause I hadn’t thought of this before, is it’s one thing to go to your 
mother’s house and provide companion services. It’s a whole other thing to walk into gang territory-- 
V: 
We’ve done it. 
I: 
--and provide—tell us the reality. 
V: 
We’ve done that. 
I: 
What are the realities of being a homecare worker, the range of situations you face? 
V: 
Well, the one thing—the one thing I’ve learned about organizing was because of homecare. I’ve been in 
unions, but as far as starting from grassroots, starting at the beginning and building, I wasn’t part of that. And 
so, with member organizing—because we’re not in a facility and we don’t have a set location, say, okay. This 
community center call center, a homecare community center where homecare workers can come—we don’t 
have that. So, we have to go to them. 
M: 
You have to go to them. 
V: 
And so, they may live down in— 
M: 
In rough territory—southwest— 
V: 
--Brightmore area where everybody knows it’s rough over there. 
M: 
Mmm hmm, Southwest Detroit— 
V: 
We’re partners, me and M. We’re gonna go and see AJ. She’s over here. We’ve gotta let her know that 
it’s time to vote. You know, how are you doin’ today? 
M: 
Mmm hmm. 
V: 
You’ve just gotta go by there [38.38]. She lives in Brightmore. We get outta the car—this is just an 
example, but it’s true. You hear gunshots, rapid fire. You know, shooting, so what do you do? You get back in 
your car. You wait ‘til it’s over. Actually, we will pull off because you have to be safe, number one. But then 
there was—now this is true. I was partnered with a gentlemen—I forgot his name, but there were homecare 
workers—maybe 10 in this one area say 3-mile radius, and we’ll walk it. We’ll park the car, and we’ll start out, 
and we’ll walk around and come back. So, now we don’t have a car. We’re on the streets. We’re walking, and 
some kids had came out, and we were walkin’ and the kids run out to the street, and they was, “Hi.” And the 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Manila Freeman and Varnette Mahone. 7.5.18

little baby ran up to me and grabbed me around my legs, and I was like, oh, little boy. Oh, my, goodness, who’s 
baby is this, you know. He was just like, “Oh, you know—” This was down in Brightmore. It’s abandoned. The 
houses are boarded up, and I was just like, oh, you’re so cute. And then I saw him havin’—‘cause he said, 
“Come back here,” and a big sister, and they ran into this abandoned house. The windows were boarded up, 
but the door had a crack. 
M: 
Mmm hmm. 
V: 
And I was just—and I said, I gotta call—and then the mother came to the door. My mind—homecare 
workers to me—we don’t—it’s not a job, it’s that—like you say, it’s not a—you don’t need total care. You just 
need that filling in where I might cook a meal for you today, or cook your meals for you, and prepare. You can 
do it yourself—you can feed yourself. You can do that part, you know, but then to me homecare is prevention. 
We prevent you to get into that stage [36.26] of total healthcare. I mean it may come, but it won’t be so hard to 
take. Like my mom for instance, we saw her gradually go from a walker to a wheelchair to the bed, but she 
wasn’t—she was happy. I don’t know if that makes sense. She knew her decline, but she was still happy. She 
still knew us. She knew that she was at home. She knew that we were there. We weren’t gonna take her and 
drop her off, you know, and somebody beatin’ her and kickin’ her, you know, people they did that in the nursing 
homes. Back in the day that’s why she said, “Don’t never do that.” 
M: 
Did that? They still do that [laughing]. 
V: 
Some of ‘em still do, and I think that is so cruel. 
M: 
I can name ‘em off the rip, which nursin’ homes are abusive. 
V: 
We are those—homecare workers are a different—they’re a different kind of people. To be a homecare 
worker, you just don’t say, oh, I’m gonna be a homecare worker because definitely you’re not gonna—the pay 
is—you’re not gonna do that, no pay. I mean low pay, no benefits, no vacation, no paid time off, no sick time, 
no—who’s gonna be a homecare worker? Who’s gonna choose to do that? So, homecare workers, like you 
said, you are either thrown—you’re eased into it by, you know, see the person’s health is, you know, slowly 
coming to their—where they, you know, can’t do for themselves— 
M: 
Right. 
V: 
So, homecare work is not a job—it’s a—what I’m trying to say is—like a—it’s a—if I could get the word 
out. It’s a lifestyle. 
M: 
Yeah. It can be, yeah. 
V: 
It’s a lifestyle. 
M: 
And to piggy-back on that, my question is, okay, we’re questioning the home workers—homecare 
workers. The question should be, what does society or the politicians or the business world or the medical field 
want from the homecare workers [33.53]? We know what we want from them. What is the stigma that is 
making the medical world so afraid to recognize homecare workers? 
V: 
Prevention. I say it’s prevention because we help them more. If they’re at home, and they’re not eating, 
they’re not drinking, it’s hot, nobody to take care of ‘em, they’re goin’ to the hospital. 
M: 
Right. I understand that, but I’m saying we know as homecare workers what we have to do. It’s cut and 
dry. We’re taking care of someone that is in need of personal home care. The gray area that I’m struggling with 
is, why is the medical profession, big business and facilities afraid of the homecare workers that are not 
working in facility—in buildings? 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Manila Freeman and Varnette Mahone. 7.5.18 
 
12
V: 
Yup. 
M: 
It seems that there is a brick wall has been put up. No communication from the powers that be for 
homecare workers, if I may say that. You know, it’s all semantics a lotta times. If I said I’m an electrical worker 
instead of an electrical engineer, is that status? 
V: 
Yes. That’s exactly [laughing]—what does that [laughing]— 
M: 
It is a pass in status. I am a doctor, surgeon, brain surgeon, or am I a Doctor of Philosophy or I’m just 
the street doctor, you know. What is it that the politicians and the medical fields don’t want us to do or be or are 
they aware, which I know they are ‘cause some of them have gotten sick and had to have a homecare 
provider. 
V: 
Yeah. 
M: 
What is it that they are afraid of about homecare workers [31.25]? Lawsuits come a dime a dozen with 
professionals. You make medical mistakes 24-7. Are you saying that homecare workers are gonna make 
mistakes? Yeah. We’re human, but you have the master’s agree—you have the PhD, you have the status, you 
make mistakes too. So, I want to know from a politician, from US—from the Secretary of Health and Education, 
what is the problem? 
V: 
What’s the problem? 
M: 
We know on a general level those workers always put down the skills of the homecare worker. I need to 
know what’s the problem. 
V: 
[Laughing]  
M: 
You know, I wanna get at—we can talk all day, all year, whatever, but until we can hear from those that 
are putting the stigma on the homecare worker, we’re not gonna go anywhere. 
V: 
Well, you know, we’ve posed those questions, and we’ve actually went to their face. We’ve sat in—like, 
we’re talking right now, and for them to actually tell us out of their mouths, you’re insignificant. 
I: 
They’ve said that? 
V: 
Yes. The one gentleman, I’m never sure—he was— 
M: 
Al S. 
V: 
His daughter got sick. 
I: 
I forgot. We only have –he tells me then, and then I forget, and— 
I2: 
This conversation is so rich. 
M: 
But do you see where I’m comin’ from? 
I: 
Yes. I 
M: 
The homecare worker know their position. They already know their part. They know that they have to 
take care of a loved one, and it might be ongoing. It may be for a little while. It may be for a lifetime [29.27]. We 
know that, and we know that we have to—they know, especially the inexperienced ones, may have to get 
training. They do gait—you know, they have to know how to lift. They have to know how to feed— 
V: 
Yeah. [Inaudible] it’s worse. 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Manila Freeman and Varnette Mahone. 7.5.18

M: 
--they have to know how—now, they even have to know how to—what is these things in the arms now? 
You know, I can’t think right now. 
V: 
That port? 
M: 
Yeah. My [inaudible] died of—but they know they have to learn these things. 
I: 
They also apparently need self-protection? 
M: 
And self-protection— 
V: 
Oh, yeah. We—health and safety, CPR and first aid— 
M: 
They know they have to know all of that. Well, yeah— 
V: 
I mean everybody should know that. 
M: 
They know they have to check in with somebody if they wanna get paid [28.40]. 
I2: 
I’m ready to go if you are? 
I: 
Oh, absolutely. All right, so let’s stop for a moment and collect our thoughts, right? 
M: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
Again, there’s so much I want to ask you. You were starting to tell a story. You were asking what do the 
politicians and the medical professionals and everything, what are they afraid of, right? 
M: 
Yes. 
I: 
You haven’t ever gotten a clear answer on that, so that’s a fuzzy area— 
V: 
No. 
I: 
--for you. 
V: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
But you had told me—I think, M, you told me this story about a politician who blocked the rights? 
M: 
Right. 
I: 
Then ended up having an accident? 
M: 
The gentleman—yeah. He was in a car with EP— 
V: 
EP [inaudible]— 
M: 
--from Oakland County was in a car. They didn’t have on their seatbelts. Somebody was drinking, 
whatever—alleged. Let me put that up there, but we know they didn’t have their seatbelts [27.44] on. He was 
sitting in the back of the car, and they were in an accident. He got hurt. He became injured very badly. He is 
now still in a wheelchair. He was with Governor—what’s the Governor’s name? 
V: 
Snyder. 
M: 
Snyder, Engler, one of ‘em. They’re all buddies. 
I: 
Jennifer Granholm? 
M: 
Yeah, but she was— 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Manila Freeman and Varnette Mahone. 7.5.18 
 
14
V: 
Probably Granholm. 
M: 
Yeah, but she—he was there, and they voted against the homecare workers unionizing, being in a 
union and all of that above. 
V: 
He was one of ‘em. 
M: 
He was one of the politicians that voted against homecare workers’ rights. 
I: 
Okay. So, he now has homecare workers, is that right? 
M: 
He probably has a paid nurse because he makes so much money. He probably has a homecare 
worker. He probably has a nurse that comes back and forth to his office. You all can look him up. He’s in a 
wheelchair now. He’s an Oakland County executive. Been there for years. He’s finally retiring. He was very 
mean towards homecare workers even though he used to get money from the union and different things, and 
now fate has it that he needs a homecare worker. One of the big-time union reps that was against homecare 
workers—she was so mean to homecare workers, she came down with breast cancer, and now she needs a 
homecare worker [26.13]. We don’t know if the cancer’s come back, but she was in a fight for her life. She was 
one of the main ones that was very mean to the homecare workers, like you’re not getting representation and 
all of this. 
V: 
Yeah. 
M: 
See so, the circle is going to evolve. You thank God today that you’re in good health because you 
never know when that health is gonna fail you, and you’re gonna need a backup or a homecare provider.  
V: 
You need us. They need us. 
M: 
You started to tell a story about somebody’s daughter? 
V: 
That was—he was another one. He was another—we did a press conference up in Lansing, and he 
definitely on just this is how he feels, “If it’s your family member, that’s your right [25.22]. That’s your job is to 
take care of ‘em. You don’t need to get paid for that.” Well, doing some research and, you know, while we’re 
trying to fight they’re fightin’ against us. More money—they have more money, so he’s paying his caregiver to 
what his daughter who was disabled—you have private homecare givers, and you have the caregivers that 
work for the state. 
M: 
Yes. 
V: 
And then you have the ones that’s workin’ for the agency, so they’re trying to make it separate. Oh, you 
get more if you get into private. If you find that one that’s got, you know, a lotta money, they’ll pay you $25 an 
hour or $15 an hour versus the state is only gonna give you half of that, and then the agency is only gonna 
give you maybe a couple a more dollars than that.  
M: 
Mmm hmm. 
V: 
But homecare workers as a whole need to come in one community with one agenda, and that’s to 
make working conditions for homecare workers better across the board [24.16]. 
M: 
Instead of having a caste-class [laughing] system in homecare. 
V: 
Like, you’re a better homecare worker ‘cause you’re working for a private—yeah, you’re living in a 
private, you know, you’re better than me because I go through the state. 
M: 
Mmm hmm. 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Manila Freeman and Varnette Mahone. 7.5.18 
 
15
V: 
Well, I’m going through the state because the person that I care for [23.56] is getting their insurance 
and their money from the state. 
M: 
Can you imagine homecare workers in a caste-class [laughing]? Can you imagine? We’re all doin’—we 
all can take temperatures. We all can do [laughing] blood pressures. Well, the majority I’m assuming. The ones 
that I know. 
V: 
Yeah. Because the people that you care for— 
M: 
But you be caste down— 
V: 
--and then you have—I forgot about those, the homecare workers that’s working with Visiting Doctors, 
so you have this visiting doctor that has a staff, a therapist, and homecare workers. So, that’s how I fought that 
with my mom, like she can’t—I can’t transfer her to the doctor, so I found her a physician that would come to 
the house. She has her therapist. She has her doctor, her supplies, you know, that she needs, and “Oh, we’ll 
give you a caregiver.” I said, no, I’m her caregiver. She doesn’t need that. But I did say—I did use it a couple a 
times because sometimes I was out with the union, then they would come. 
I: 
Okay. So, let me ask you—before we leave today I want to make sure we drill a little deeper because I 
think we have a pretty good idea of what you need—what you’re asking for. You need higher wages. 
M: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
You need benefits. You need guaranteed hours. 
M: 
Yeah. 
I: 
You need training, right? 
M: 
Yes. 
I: 
Okay. 
M: 
Some type of benefits [22.23].  
V: 
Yes. 
I: 
Okay. You need respect, but, M, before we started this interview you had some really specific 
strategies on how we go about getting this. 
M: 
I do have one major thing [laughing] to say. If a—let em be kind, and I don’t want anybody to take this 
out of context or use it in—if a person can be a stripper, dancing on a pole, getting more respect or getting 
more money than a homecare worker, what is that telling you? That’s saying, and I’m not throwing anybody—
that’s saying—a lot of them have to go register with the city of Detroit, register with—they get taxes taken out 
of their money, and that’s called a job. And they get their hours.  
V: 
They have a union. 
M: 
They have a union. Look at the homecare workers, and I’m just saying is it that the state wants to 
regulate homecare workers, if they want to and have them come through the state like everybody else, then do 
so. Do something, [laughing] you know. I just wanted to say, and I’m not putting nobody under the bus, I’m just 
saying do you see the scenario that I just painted—how can you say, oh, they also—what happened another 
thing is, these young ladies, and bless they hearts, they created some jobs. They created hair braiding. The 
state saw that they were making big money, so the state said, “If you wanna be in a shop, you have to come 
through me now and get a license to braid hair in a shop, and then we will give you your respect.” Same thing

Manila Freeman and Varnette Mahone. 7.5.18

with the Lottery. People were [laughs] doin’ illegal lottery, in the streets makin’ money [19.47], and the state 
said, “We need to get ahold of some of that money,” so what did they come up with? State Lottery, so the 
numbers people or the poor people—it wasn’t just gangsters [laughing]. It was poor people out there playin’ the 
numbers. They said, “Well, we’re gonna have to take that money from ya all.” So, my question is still prevalent, 
do they want the homecare workers to unionize? Do they want us to take a test? Do they want us to get 
trained? What is it that we have to do in order to get the respect? Can I be called—when people were domestic 
workers, you didn’t tell nobody no—after 1960 and ’70 you didn’t say I was a house cleaner. I was a domestic 
engineer, or you’d get embarrassed. They’ll tell you to shut up. You didn’t call a homecare worker—you 
didn’t— 
V: 
Chore provider. 
M: 
Right. A chore provider, sure, sure. 
V: 
Chore services. 
M: 
Come on, the chore service. You say they’re domestic engineers. At first, they wasn’t getting social 
security. Now, they have to pay their social security, you know, the workers had to be claimed. They could pay 
taxes. They could get their social security credit, so what is the stigma of against home providers—homecare 
providers? 
V: 
You know, so far— 
I: 
But [inaudible] because I really thought homecare workers were now considered in the domestic worker 
category? 
M: 
That’s what I said. That’s what I thought, too, but the state of Michigan has a different take on it. 
V: 
It’s to me—working with so many other caregivers in other states, Michigan does not want homecare 
providers, period. They want it eliminated. They trying to take homecare out of the equation. If you get sick, 
and you need somebody to take care of you, then you go through these agencies. You won’t have a choice. 
They wanna have it to where they make the choice for you. Where, now, you have a choice if you want it to be 
your daughter or you want it to be—well, a wife can’t take care of a husband, and a husband can’t take care of 
a wife, which I thought we dealt with that, but that wasn’t true because my daughter, her husband, fell off his 
motorcycle and broke his arm—I mean broke his leg, so we’re thinkin’ he needs temporary homecare. Why 
can’t she do it? She can’t do it. 
M: 
[Laughs]. 
V: 
But why not? 
M: 
What if you don’t have anybody else to take care or you? 
V: 
Right. So, now I have to go through Detroit Area on Aging, now, who’s never answering the phone 
[16.40]. 
M: 
Never. 
V: 
Who’s never getting back with me. Meanwhile, I can’t get up. I can’t do this, so what is she gonna do? 
She’s gonna take care of him. Then why won’t you pay her? They do not want the individual independent 
homecare worker like us. 
M: 
It’s a vicious cycle. 
V: 
Yeah. They want us gone, but we’re not goin’ anywhere.

I: 
So, what I’m hearing is they want you gone because they think family members should be taking care 
of people, but I couldn’t here your questions, M, as V was talking, what if there’s no family? What happens to 
those people? 
V: 
What happens to them? 
M: 
We have a whole apartment building on Forrest and 75-- 
V: 
Warren— 
M: 
--Warren and Forrest. They could really tell you because a lot of those people in that apartment building 
don’t have family members to take care of them. 
V: 
Right there on Gratiot and Vandyke. 
M: 
And they’re all not seniors. 
V: 
DeQuinder and Outer Drive. There was a whole apartment building for sale [inaudible]— 
M: 
Vandyke— 
V: 
--that I was talkin’ about was on Dexter and Lawrence—these people, you know, some of ‘em had drug 
issues, and you know, some of ‘em—whatever the issue was, they needed help. That building has been 
destroyed. The windows are—and I looked at it, and I’m like this was a beautiful place [15.18]. 
I: 
Where did those people go? 
M: 
We don’t know, and the main thing is they really interrupted—they inter—and we knew this was a 
master plan because one of the main staples of the city was known as the Detroit Health Department. I was 
born in Hermerkiefer Hospital, right over there off of 12th and Clairmont. Every poor person in the city of Detroit, 
whether you was an immigrant or not, the word would get around, you go there because that’s the Health 
Department— 
I: 
Or Health Clinic, yup. 
M: 
Everybody knew that was a stable arm in the city of Detroit. That little old, ugly, red building— 
V: 
Is gone. 
I: 
It’s gone. 
M: 
They shut it down. 
V: 
It’s gone. 
M: 
And people don’t know how to get around to other buildings where the birth and death record is in one 
building, the sexually transmitted disease clinic is in another building, the substance abuse is in one—[13.55]. 
V: 
Mental health. 
M: 
--the immunizations, mental health and on and on— 
V: 
That was our job. That’s our job. We find out what they need to do, and then help them get there. 
M: 
Right. ‘Cause we have to find out ‘cause it changes every 10, 12 months. 
V: 
[Laughing] yeah. 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Manila Freeman and Varnette Mahone. 7.5.18

M: 
You get phone calls like, “Where do I go? What can I get?” Healthcare workers—everybody knew 
where that building is. It’s still standin’ but they haven’t torn it down, but that is one of the main reasons why 
people aren’t trusting now, because that was a shot in the arm for those that needed care. That was a shot in 
the arm of those that was giving care. It’s just the little things that are constantly tearing away at the homecare 
workers jobs in the community [12.56]. 
V: 
The individual homecare worker. 
M: 
Yeah, 
I: 
So, before we have to close, you had two very concrete suggestions— 
M: 
Yes. 
I: 
--that I would love for you to talk about. One was you were talking about the high school dropouts and 
GED programs, and you were also talking about the homecare workers need a community center, something 
where at the very least people like you could answer questions? 
M: 
I’m gonna let her have that last piece, but the first piece is regardless of GED education and all of that, 
the level of dropout rates, and this is a known fact, a lotta people—they still dropout at the 8th and 9th grade 
levels. Reason being there’s certain parts of the curriculum that they can’t handle or is so much over 
population in the classroom that they’re not grasping it, or it is being taught in a way that they cannot grasp it 
because they know that as they go higher there are jobs out here that they will not be able to get to. Now, a lot 
of our homecare workers have a fear or had a fear of math. The reason being all of those above and more. I 
had a program which could teach just the basic fractions in math within 6 weeks. We were going with the book 
called, Contemporary Number Power. That is a series of books that have helped so many people graduate 
even our mixed populations can handle that. Why? Because the book is from the old school of how we learn. 
Not with computers and everything. It’s the hand and it’s the tactile stimulation of touching, writing in the book, 
doing the math in the book. A lotta people was taught that way, and they’re so hard to get away from that type 
of learning as to using a workbook [10.25]. We, a group of colleagues of mine, we wondered why the students 
couldn’t grasp it, or they also have a high school graduation—a lotta students have graduated from high 
school, but yet they have, what? A fear of fractions. Fractions to us—it may not be to the professions or 
whatever, but what we have seen is that fractions opens the door to a higher-order thinking math, and if you 
cannot do the problems, and if there’s a blockage, if you didn’t catch on, then you’re gonna dropout of high 
school or you’re just gonna leave math alone, and they’re gonna drop you outta high school, and we found out 
that’s a national trend through these United States, and there is such a quick and easy way to teach it. I knew 
fractions because the programs we had growing up we had sewing; we had cooking; we had to shop where we 
had to learn fractions in order to succeed in life. We had to measure. We had to cut. We had to know both 
sides of the ruler—the standard and the metric side. Those programs were eliminated out of the schools 20 
years ago for a reason, and we know that if you give a child—a lot of the children start at the gate, ready to go, 
ready to learn, but if you snatch away basic things that they need to know or should know, they won’t succeed. 
And the majority of these people they came across in these programs were those that programs have been cut 
in their younger age. They didn’t have sewing. They didn’t have shop. They didn’t have anything to do with 
fractions but a classroom. They didn’t have anything to help stimulate the mind and give them that ah-ha 
moment that, oh, that’s what a fraction is. That’s how you use a fraction. That’s how you convert, and I was just 
blown away. After we used this book with that set group, and that’s the group between the ages of 21 to 45 
years of age, we started sayin’ they missed out on what I had in high school. They missed out on those 
programs that was mandatory. 
I: 
Now, tell me how that relates to homecare workers? 
M: 
Our homecare workers average age, 21 to 45. 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Manila Freeman and Varnette Mahone. 7.5.18 
 
19
I: 
And getting that kind of primary—going back—the refresher courses and things like that, how would 
that help them as a homecare worker? 
M: 
Then they could go on get a higher certification and whatever the states wants them to do continue to 
still be a homecare worker. If you have to take that CNA [6.58] class, you can pass it. You can do 
measurements. If the state gives them—see that is a barrier for them to move forward, so if the state comes up 
with a training program that they should be able to and they have a math portion in it ‘cause you know if you’re 
in nursing or if you’re in homecare you know you have to— 
V: 
Yeah. You have to take that exam. 
M: 
--yeah. You know you have to know how to do portions. You know you have to do measurement. You 
know, you have to measure food. 
V: 
Everything. 
M: 
A cup of food. You know, standard measurement. Instead of givin’ a ½ cup of oats, they gotta have a 
full cup of oats. Then you can say the majority of them that want the training can’t, you know. 
I: 
And, V, can you tell us about this other idea—a community? 
V: 
So, what we need is a homecare provider’s—homecare workers community center— 
M: 
Or hotline. 
V: 
--or a hotline. We need to have a actual place that homecare workers, whether it be on the phone—
which we’re more visual. Like, we’re talking. We are more apt to have a face-to-face meeting because first we 
wanna figure out, you know, we wanna know what it is that you need. Once we assess that, we can help you. If 
we can’t help you—if it’s another issue that we’ve been fighting for, we’ll let you know that. You know, we just 
want you to know what’s happening to us now as a caregiver. This community center would be a base for that 
training for health and safety [4.58]. Things that we had before that we don’t have now. We want it back. We 
want that training center back. We want all the things that were taken away from us that we worked so hard for 
that helped a lotta people. 
M: 
Mmm hmm. 
V: 
We have a few people that came in I’ll say a couple a years after organizing that couldn’t read. 
M: 
Mmm hmm. 
V: 
DS was one of ‘em. D, big guy, he was maybe 300, 400 pounds, but he was about 6’. He was huge. 
Just a big baby. He was adorable, and he came into the training program. He learned how to read, and he 
wrote this poem that just blew—not just our local union but our international union away because he learned 
how to read, and it was like the light just went off in his head. All these years that some things that I coulda 
been doin’ I couldn’t do because I couldn’t read, so we want that back. We want those caregivers who’s 
teenage daughter or I mean who’s parent, who’s young child is taking care of them, and need that extra help. 
You know, it’s hard for a child to take care of a parent versus the parent take care of the child. That’s the norm, 
but for the child to have to take care of the parent, that education, that, you know, is something gonna be 
missin’ in that child’s life? Why would you place that on a child at such a young age? I mean I’m not 
questioning because I was one of ‘em. It didn’t affect me as far as education because my mother was a 
teacher [2.55], so days when she couldn’t walk she would tell me what to do. She would buy a stool and put 
me up to the sink and let me wash the dishes. She would train me. On her good days she would go to the 
grocery store and she would put me in the car and she will show me how to pick meat and how to shop for 
vegetables.

M: 
Mmm hmm. 
V: 
At the same time, though, I thought that that’s the way everybody was. 
M: 
[Laughs]. 
V: 
But it’s not, and this training center for me it would be to help those ones that are going through 
something—whatever it is. We don’t know what it is. Everybody is not goin’ through the same thing. Yours 
might not even be wages. You might be from a wealthy family, but you don’t have the support for carrying for 
this person [1.58]. They have Alzheimer’s, so you go to an Alzheimer’s support group, but that’s not the same 
as being that caregiver that nobody understands. 
M: 
Mmm hmm. 
V: 
That you, you know, that’s so hard. 
I: 
I am so sorry to cut this off, but I’m lookin at the clock and I promised the librarian we would be out of 
here by now. 
V: 
Okay.  
I: 
I can’t believe it’s already after 1. You are amazing, awesome. So, inspiring, and we need to stop. 
M: 
[laughter]. 
I: 
That’s so unfortunate. 
M: 
All we want is a grant to get a building, to get a tiny office space so we can say, Homecare Workers 
are— 
V: 
Homecare Workers Community Center— 
M: 
--not even community center, we’re here at last. We’re hear to try to get somethin’ started for you. 
V: 
Yes. 
I: 
Well, let’s do it. Let’s have our—let’s start another. I mean let’s schedule another time to get together to 
talk more. I think we need to clear out of here. 
M: 
Yes. 
I: 
K can do his photographs outside maybe? 
M: 
Okay. 
I: 
And we can find time to talk again. 
M: 
Okay. 
I: 
But before I shut this down I want to say thank you, thank you, thank you. 
V: 
Thank you again. 
M: 
Thank you and don’t let it die because— 
V: 
I hope not. 
M: 
--the fight still goes on. This is not just for, you know, the fight has gotta go on.

V: 
We get so excited [.30]. 
M: 
Do it for the grant. Do it for—because you never know one of you may, and I hope not, need a 
homecare worker, and you never know. 
V: 
Yeah. This is really—to me this is an honor to— 
M: 
Yeah. It’s a great honor. 
V: 
--even be asked to speak and hear what I have to say about it. 
I: 
It’s an honor to listen. 
V: 
Thank you [laughs]. 
I: 
On that note, I’m gonna shut these off so they don’t really get mad at us [end tape 1]. 
Tape #2 – the interview continued outside after leaving the library 
M: 
Arizona, New Mexico, California, New York, Chicago, and talking to the people just like that young lady 
of multiple ethnicities, if I can say that right. It makes me angry when I say that. The main thing that they have 
told me is, it’s the math, and it’s the writing [15.55]. 
V: 
Yeah. That’s true. 
M: 
And that’s 9th grade, and when they come through GED do you know they have to know how to write an 
essay, and it’s a five-paragraph essay. It’s an old-fashioned way they have to know how to set it up. 
V: 
Yeah. 
M: 
That’s Part 1. Part 2 is knowing how to create sentences. That’s a federal test. They have to know 
fractions. They now have to know geometry. There are about one or two trigonometry questions on the GED 
test that they have to know. A lotta these students can’t even do 12 by 12 in the multiplication table. It is 
heartbreaking. It is an educational thing, and it’s like a gray area that— 
V: 
We need to get it and fix it. 
M: 
--that we have known for over 30 years, and the government has known it. And I’m not accusin’ I’m just 
sayin’ if you don’t have the jobs, then they can’t graduate. If they can’t graduate, it’s gonna be poverty. Poverty. 
I: 
But you’re saying they have the jobs. The jobs are there. 
V: 
Yeah. 
M: 
If they—yeah. 
V: 
They don’t have the education. 
M: 
They don’t have the education. There’s not a lotta jobs there, and they gotta cut it off at some—they 
gotta cut off graduation and higher learning somewhere, so they can keep those down [14.17]. 
I: 
There are homecare jobs. 
M: 
And those are homecare jobs. They can do those. Anybody—not anybody. We all can do it. 
V: 
Yeah. 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Manila Freeman and Varnette Mahone. 7.5.18 
 
22
I: 
Well, okay, so I’m gonna keep this interview going. Is that okay? Right? ‘Cause we were talking about 
homecare workers are a different kind of person, and you said, which is beautiful, that they have a heart of— 
V: 
For people 
I: 
--for people, and that heart is powerful. 
V: 
Yeah. 
I: 
But they need more than that heart. They need some skills—technical skills— 
V: 
Yeah. You need skills. You need skills. 
I: 
What else do they need besides that heart? 
M: 
They need skills, and they need a place where they can find out where they can get those acquired 
skills, and then they need to know from the state [13.27] what kinda—how ya doin’ sir? [someone passed by] 
P: 
All right. 
M: 
All right. What kinda skills do I need in order for you to recognize me as a homecare worker? 
I: 
And what would you say? How would you answer that? 
M: 
I would say depending on the age-level of the homecare worker, ‘cause there’s some people takin’ care 
of their people, you know, as old as they can, you know. An elderly couple takin’ care of—I would say just 
basic skills. Like the program E came up with, just basic skills. Do you know how to measure a cup of oats? Do 
you know how to feed? Do you know how to call 911? Do you know who’s the person you need to call? Do you 
have an emergency list available? If you should get sick and can’t take care of someone, who are you gonna 
call? You know, we have so many people you think they  know, but they don’t know. Case in point, remember 
how people used to use bleach and ammonia, and that used to be a toxic bomb. 
V: 
Oooh, yeah. 
I: 
Yeah. So, I tried it once. 
V: 
Yeah. Don’t do that. 
M: 
But back in the day, that’s all a lotta people had was bleach and ammonia to clean their houses with. 
What is green? What is the green effect? Do you know how to clean your house without using so many harsh 
chemicals? Little stuff like that. Do you know, you know, what you know, if you’re in a diabetic coma, what do 
you need in your house if you have diabetes. You know. 
I: 
Well, now mention what happens if your client or your person goes into a diabetic coma? 
V: 
Yeah. You know, a lotta stuff has been over the last 12 years—over the last 12 years has been late 
already. Like I said for the health and safety training, the CPR, what do you do, you know, assess the situation. 
And it’s always safety first. We’ve laid that out. We have that [11.19]. You know, we know what to do with that 
part, it’s just sharing that with other caregivers, past, present, and future is where we’re at now. We’ve—a lotta 
those caregivers that we were with, they’re not around anymore. Some have passed on, some have, you 
know, they need a caregiver now. So, the ones that are presently caregivers, ,they’re working off of the things 
that we have done. 
M: 
Exactly. 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Manila Freeman and Varnette Mahone. 7.5.18 
 
23
V: 
See, they don’t know—it wasn’t like—it wasn’t always like this, how they have it now. You know, you 
can get that E started the health and safety. 
M: 
Mmm hmm. 
V: 
We didn’t have that until we organized to get those things, to make our working conditions better. 
M: 
Mmm hmm. 
V: 
So, now, that’s being threatened, and we are being attacked. You know, champions of homecare, we 
are not, you know, we’re not gonna give up. No. We gonna continue to play this game they’re doin’. They’re 
playing with people’s lives. You know, and it needs to stop. We’re trying—it’s like this is no longer gonna 
happen. You cannot continue to play with people lives, and don’t think there’s some repercussions and 
consequences. We’re gonna continue to take care of our people, and whether you, you know, recognize us or 
not, somewhere there is gonna be— 
M: 
It’s still gonna happen. 
V: 
--there is gonna be— 
M: 
A homecare worker. 
V: 
Yeah. We are gonna get the results that we’re looking for, and you’re not gonna be able to stop us 
‘cause after that, then I figure as long as we continue you won’t be able to stop us [9.36], and then we’re gonna 
pass that on to those care givers or who are gonna continue—you pass the baton. You know, we running this 
race. I did my lap [laughing], now it’s your turn. You know, then just keep it goin’. 
M: 
It’s gonna keep on goin’ ‘cause human life, I mean human nature—population is gonna keep on goin’. 
V: 
Yeah. 
M: 
It’s like, yeah. 
I: 
I have to stop and let him work his magic, but one— 
I2: 
Or I can talk to one person. 
I: 
Yes. Okay. If you could talk to M, I want to get the story about the hat. [V was wearing a huge wide-
brimmed, bright purple hat with leopard skin trim.] 
M: 
Oh, the hat. The purple hat. 
I: 
Yes. For the—the people who are just listening, V has this marvelous, deep purple hat. How would you 
describe this hat? 
V: 
This hat is famous. There are so many pictures out there I don’t even know where they are [8.42]. They 
are DC, California, people just stop, yup. We’re doing interviews or we’re out at an event. Just let me get a 
picture of the hat. You know, what about me? You wanna hear what I have to say? “We know what you’re 
saying, you know, we’ve heard you. Let’s get a picture of that hat.” 2008, I’m a hat person, 2008 one of our 
member services workers in the union had saw—saw this hat, and he said that it was me. He said, “V that hat 
is you. I bought it and it’s you.” And I love it. I love it. The shade is a number I love. It’s a I would say my—you 
know, when you’re nervous and you’re kinda like, you know, you know you’re gonna do something big like this 
interview, which is like totally big, like so awesome. This is my pacifier. I can wear it, and I can say what I want, 
and then it’s like I don’t, you know, have no holds barred of this hat. And I have a bear coat with it, but that’s in 
the winter time. We’ll probably—

Manila Freeman and Varnette Mahone. 7.5.18 
 
24
I: 
Oh, what’s the coat look like? 
V: 
It’s bear. 
I: 
A bear coat. 
V: 
Bear is brown.  
I: 
Bear fur? 
V: 
No. It’s actually—I don’t know what type of material it is [laughs]. 
I: 
Fifteen pounds. 
V: 
But it’s so warm, and it comes all the way down to my ankles, and it’s all the way up, and it’s just like 
when I’m this big. I’m like 400 pounds in this coat. 
I: 
It gives you courage. 
V: 
Yeah. And that’s what this hat does, it gives me courage. 
I: 
Okay. Well, thank you for sharing that story. It’s a great hat. 
V: 
Thank you.  
I: 
And I’m so glad K’s gonna get some pictures of you in that. 
V: 
Okay [laughs], yeah. It’s seen the 2008 elections of President Obama. It’s seen the—we’ve been 
together in a campaign for California workers who were being deserted, trying to be ostracized and 
[inaudible].Their governor at that time was Arnold Swartzenagger. It’s seen an actual Iowa and St. Louis—I 
was on a take-back Labor Day tour when the republican party had their convention in Minnesota. I believe that 
was in ’08 or ’07, and Iowa had flooded. Just I had never seen anything like it. Some of our members in the 
union had got—they were affected by it, so we went out there and helped ‘em, and the hat was there. I mean 
this hat has been everywhere. It’s been to DC; it’s been in the capitol; it’s been in the house; it’s been 
everywhere. It’s been to Lansing. 
I: 
I’ll have to go get a picture of you in the coat. 
V: 
Oh, yeah, [laughing] yeah, yeah, yeah [laughing]. 
I: 
I think it’s your turn for photos. 
V: 
Okay. Okay. 
M: 
Well, I’m glad it worked out for you ‘cause you know it’s hard. Believe it or not we have to get 
homecare—people to trust homecare workers again because of the stigma that was thrown at us because of 
the situation, and then when the Governor said, “This is a right-to-work state, and if you’re a homecare 
worker—” that one sentence said that if you’re a felon, you can’t do homecare or something they said. I have to 
get what he was saying, the gist of it. That scared a lotta homecare workers because some of ‘em have been 
to jail, but they’re taking care of their parent. They’re takin good care of their parent. 
I: 
Hey, K, are you gonna be able to get just a few of them together? 
I2: 
Oh, love to. 
V:

No.

Oh, that’s good to know. 
M: 
Oh, yeah. But yeah, this is a national situation. This is just not a basic Michigan. This is a national 
situation. 
I: 
So, I do have another question. This Community Center for Homecare Workers, there’s nothing like 
that now? Nothing like that? 
M: 
Girl, no. You know it’s not [laughs]. 
I: 
Okay. ‘Cause people keep telling me that there’s a personal care worker association in the state of 
Michigan. 
M: 
Did you—a personal care, you know what, I’m gonna look them up. 
I: 
Personal Care Worker Association. 
M: 
I’m gonna look them up and see what the qualifications is to sit on their board or become a member. 
I: 
Does it exist? 
M: 
That’s what I’m gonna find out. 
I: 
‘Cause I didn’t know one— 
M: 
A personal care—

I: 
Yeah. Like a direct care worker association or a personal care assistant association or something like 
that [2.51]. 
M: 
I wonder if somebody’s just sitting in that office collectin’ a paycheck and doin’ nothin’. 
I: 
Well, it might not exist. You know, it might be a myth. And then I was told there was something at the 
national level too, and the only thing I can think of is that national—the National Domestic Workers’ 
Association. 
M: 
That’s what I’m thinking. That’s what I’m thinking because homecare—areas of homecare fall upon the 
domestic workers. 
I: 
Now, I also know that the National Domestic Workers’ Association is working with, I believe, SEIU, and 
Michigan United or United Michigan— 
M: 
Michigan United. 
I: 
--okay, to do some local organizing or for— 
M: 
Yeah. A lot of them came out of homecare. I think— 
I: 
So, do you know anything about that effort? 
M: 
Wait a minute ‘cause I supposed to be— 
I: 
Last year. 
M: 
Who’s over Michigan United now? 
V: 
I believe her name is R. 
M: 
Oh, she’s international? 
V: 
She’s international. 
M: 
Well, who was here—was Z over that or who was over there, here in Detroit when they first started? 
V: 
So, that’s what I—I was not aware Michigan United had [1.34] anything to do with homecare, but we 
just did that Lobby Day back in— 
M: 
That’s where they was tryin’ to come back— 
V: 
--that was in June, the first week of June. 
M: 
Who was the lady that went back to California, but she’ll be here Friday? 
V: 
That’s Miss H. HS. She’s here to help Care Workers in Action—it’s Domestic Workers in Action and 
SEIU have come together to try to help us organize again, but this is homecare and childcare workers merging 
together to be one organization. 
I: 
And what’s the name of it? 
V: 
It’s called Care Workers in Action. 
I: 
Care Workers—and is that just for the greater Detroit area? 
V: 
Oh, no. The whole state of Michigan. 
I: 
The whole state.

V: 
Yeah. We’re trying to reach out to all the caregivers—all caregivers in Michigan. 
I: 
Okay. All right. 
V: 
Yes. 
M: 
And like I was telling V I thought homecare already had their union organized— 
V: 
Nope. 
M: 
--depending on what homecare division. 
V: 
Because now they still have members paying dues. Where it was 55,000 plus, now it may be a 1,000. 
I: 
Oh, my, gosh. Wow. 
V: 
It was devasting. That was devasting. You talkin’ about crushed. 
M: 
But see, they didn’t have representation even though you were payin’ dues. 
V: 
Yeah. 
M: 
Where was the money goin’? 
V: 
But the only thing—exactly. 
M: 
Where was the money goin’? 
I: 
Okay. So, now he’s gonna take pictures of the two of you together, and while he does that I’m gonna 
get your gift cards ready. 
M: 
Oh, okay. 
V: 
Oh, all right [laughing].
