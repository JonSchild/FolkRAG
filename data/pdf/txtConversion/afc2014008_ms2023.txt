Before I begin my remarks I would like to acknowledge how
 
large a debt all of us here owe to the three men who
 
spear-headed this conference.
 I
'm not sure anyone else could
 
have -
 most of us came I believe because of their reputations
 
for true collegiality, honest respect for the multiple ways we
 
work in this field and their incredible industry and mindfulness
 
of detail.
 It couldn't be a bad conference if Dan Patterson and
 
George Holt ran it -
 and it couldn't be a dull conference if
 
they were joined by Archie Green.
 
Now turning to my own remarks,  I have to say I am truly
 
honored to be invited to speak here.
 I never did a keynote
 
speech before and as I thought about it,  I wasn't quite sure
 
what the literal key note of this conference should be.
 As I
 
look around I see a lot of different kind of people sitting  here
 
with different experiences and interests.
 What i
?
iote should I
 
sound?
 I finally decided to put away my bugle and just give you
 
some informal personal reflections  (this will not be a scholarly
 
paper),  -
 and hope that in some ways my own personal journey at
 
least from time to time may move in synchrony with yours.
 I
'll
 
start off as I always do with a story.
 (I come from a
 
story-telling family.)
 
When I first began working for the National Endowment for
 
I
 
the Arts (which is a a federal granting agency,  for those who
 
may not be familiar with it),  I was introduced to a gentleman
 
who was described as being in charge of the Endowment's
 
evaluation program.
 I thought this was an interesting thing to
 
be doing, but I was pretty busy,  and I confess I quite forgot
 
about him until one day when he appeared in my office enquiring
 
exactly how did I plan to evaluate such activities as might
 
emerge from Folk Arts grants.
 Well,  this was a real poser.
 I
 
really didn't have a clue as to how to evaluate anything, but my
 
new friend informed me that formal evaluations were being
 
required for all federal activities at that particular time.
 
This was, of course,  in the green and leafy and hopeful days of
 
the Carter administration.
 It all sort of drifted away,  like
 
clouds of smoke,  in later days.
 Nobody actually sa
d we didn't
 
need to evaluate things any longer or we didn't need evaluators,
 
they just weren't there after a while...
 
Anyway,  at that particular time,  it was clear I had to think
 
about how to evaluate folk activities and events,  so I did.
 And
 
the longer I thought about the problem,  the more complicated it
 
seemed to become.
 I finally decided to seek outside help,  and I
 
turned to Professor John Szwed of Yale University who at the
 
time was a member of the Folk Arts reviewing panel.
 John Szwed,
 
as many of you know,  is possessed of a remarkable,  adult and
 
subtle mind and enjoys -
-
 as the old folk joke puts it -
-
"defining the indefinable and unscrewing the inscrutable" and he
 
accepted my commission with interest.
 
Some weeks later,  I asked him how he was coming on and he
 
told me a most instructive story.  Qiite a large number, he
 
said, of Washington bureaucrats were,  like me, worrying about
 
just how to do all this evaluation business,  so much so that the
 
principal evaluators from all the agencies were getting together
 
weekly for luncheon meetinss where they could share experiences
 
and problems and calm their troubled spirits.
 John finally
 
wangled an invitation to a luncheon at which he enquired of the
 
assembled experts if they had determined any single principle of
 
evaluation that they had all agreed upon, one that worked
 
reliably under any and all circumstances.
 
After due consideration,  the answer came -
-
 yes.
 They had
 
indeed determined one immutable and totally reliable principle.
 
Under no circumstances,  they told John, could the results of any
 
action be determined before it was necessary to take the next
 
action...
 I
'm going to say that again... Under no circumstances
 
can the results of any action be determined before it is
 
necessary to undertake the next action.
 
Well.
 I had to admit, my entire life's experience had led
 
me to much the same conclusion,  though I didn't know how to
 
articulate it in such a crisp and devastating formula.
 All my
 
life I had felt I was sort of muddling along, doing what came to
 
hand and what seemed relatively productive and useful, never
 
terribly clear as to what might result but generally going on
 
the principle enunciated by my domino-playing sister-in-law that
 
anything beats a blank.
 And then I was a pretty good-hearted
 
sort and sometimes thought things through pretty thoroughly and
 
probably it would all turn out pretty well.
 Real scientific,  I
 
was.
 
But I had always thought everybody else was smarter than I
 
was and knew more and were better educated.
 But if nobody could
 
tell the result of any action in time to correct the next action
 
accordingly,  then everybody was working in pretty much the same
 
way -
-
 trying out what seemed logical and might work,  based on
 
parallel observations and one's own reading of history.
 In a
 
way it was kind of liberating.
 If no one could guarantee
 
results,  then every one might well pull up their socks and begin
 
to try to improve the current situation by putting their own
 
skills and interests to work.
 
I did have to admit that the Szwed Principle was not going
 
to offer me much help in how to evaluate future activities.
 
However,  it might turn out to be a real help in thinking about
 
things that had already occurred.
 Why, of course.
 A light
 
turned on.
 When the pioneers of the disciplines of folklore and
 
cultural anthropology and ethnomusicology set out upon their
 
ground-breaking work,  they didn't know ahead of time either just
 
'
1
 
I
 
what they were going to find out or just what their efforts
 
would result in.
 We do know now, but that is because they found
 
it out for us and told us and that makes it seem pretty easy.
 
Simple and obvious.
 It's not especially surprising or
 
horrifying, then,  that Margaret Mead and John Lomax and Curt
 
Sachs and Charles Seeger and Melville Herskovitz and Francis
 
James Child did and said pretty bone-headed things upon
 
occasion; the results of their actions had not at the time been
 
determined.
 But I want to come back to that thought later.
 For
 
the moment,  let's stick to my problems with how on earth to
 
evaluate the results of a Folk Arts project.
 
Let's take as an example a simple concert.
 How could
 
should one establish a proper time frame (as
 
it) when all this evaluating should happen?
 
what questions to ask, when should one start
 
immediately after?
 the next morning? a week
 
I learned to
 
Assuming one
 
to ask them:
 
later? a month?
 
or
 
call
 
knew
 
was perfectly plain that the results of any enquiry would be
 
totally different depending simply upon the time when the
 
enquiries were made.
 
It
 
And then what should the standards be?  Let's try something
 
simple -
-
 how about attendance?
 
That sounds straightforward.
 
We could ask grantees simply to count how many people came.
 But
 
suppose they came and then wished they hadn't?
 
Suppose lots of
 
people came and the event was so boring that everyone went to
 
sleep?  Or went home?  Suppose nobody came at all, hardly, but
 
the performers had a wonderful party and thought it was all a
 
great success?
 I can tell you about a remarkable occasion when
 
just that happened,  and five years later people are still
 
talking about what a seminal event it was and how many
 
significant developments have stemmed directly out of that
 
"disastrous" occasion in later years.
 It was really most
 
instructive;  I won't go into it exhaustively, but it is
 
definitely worth some serious consideration.
 The event -
-
 a
 
"simple" concert -
-
 was conceived of and energized by a single
 
person, essentially,  an independent researcher and discographer
 
named Douglas Seroff who had spent many years of self-imposed
 
drudgery discovering and straightening out the complex history
 
of the African-American unaccompanied vocal quartet movement,
 
especially that part of it that had been captured on 78 r
.p.m.
 
records.
 This had been a true labor of love -
-
 essentially
 
unpaid, unpublished and unsolicted.
 He never received an A plus
 
from a graduate instructor for that work,  nor a nickel as far as
 
I know or even much of a pat on the back, because very few
 
people knew what he was doing.
 (I'd like to add here
 
parenthetically that many people here in this room have done
 
just this same thing -
 contributed their expertise out of love
 
for very little return,  but I can't tell everybody's story!)
 
He came up with what he thought was a wonderful idea for a
 
concert -
-
 a great reunion of all the old-time quartets that had
 
risen up around the city of Birmingham, Alabama during the 20's,
 
30's and 40's, the hey-day of quartet singing.
 He elicited Folk
 
Arts support at the Endowment, he involved Hank Willett,  at that
 
time folk arts coordinator for Alabama and long time lover of
 
the genre, he tracked down the old-time singers, now scattered
 
from California to Brooklyn, he wrote and edited and published a
 
program containing the best of his historical photographs of the
 
older quartets and biographies of the singers and an over-view
 
history of the movement.
 He rented a hall where many of the
 
great concerts had occurred in the old days and lined up radio
 
and newspaper publicity,  and engaged almost half of a nearby
 
motel where the 50-odd singers and their families could be
 
accommodated.
 
I came down from Washington for the grand occasion.
 It was
 
in a cavernous hail holding perhaps 3000 people,  fronted by an
 
enormous stage with an absolute forest of microphones, maybe
 
twenty of them strung across in a fragile line.
 And when the
 
performance began, peering around me in the gloom,  I could see
 
no more than perhaps 50 people though I later heard there were
 
200 more scattered through the hall.
 And at least three of them
 
were from the Endowment.
 It was hard toknow where to look, what
 
to do, what to say.
 But then the first quartet came striding
 
out on the stage,  all duded up in matching pin-striped suits and
 
uffled white shirts,  full of excitement,  raring to go.
 They
 
grabbed four microphones at random and began to sing with
 
I
  
obvious and unblemished delight in the power and excitement of
 
their own performance.
 Other old gentlemen peeked out from the
 
'
 
wings,  whooping them on,  running out to give them high fives and
 
big hugs between songs.
 
The audience began to cheer up.
 We clapped and stamped
 
trying to make up in enthusiasm for our small numbers.
 And the
 
quartets kept coming, one after another, bounding out like young
 
super-stars onto the stage,  ripping the mikes off their stands
 
and parading down through the empty aisles as though thousands
 
were cheering them on.
 As we left the hall at the end, one of
 
the wives who had been sitting near me turned and said,  her face
 
glowing with triumph,  "Well now, wasn't that the nicest thing?
 
When are we going to do it again!"
 
I just couldn't answer her.
 From every technical point of
 
view,  it could hardly have been worse.
 The sound in the hall
 
was appalling,  as the excited singers grabbed microphone after
 
microphone and put them back on the wrong stands; by the end of
 
the evening,  the cords were literally in knots all over the
 
stage and after the first few numbers, we never heard a balance
 
sound again.
 None of the quartets would leave the stage until
 
exhaustion had set in,  so the whole thing dragged on for hours
 
until well past midnight.
 And -
-
 bleakest of all -
-
 the local
 
audience had simply not shown up; they had not supported their
 
own.
 Worth Long and I discussed it in whispers.
 Had the whole
 
-
g
 
idea been mis-timed?  Had it been the wrong thing to do to begin
 
with?
 Had the execution been at fault?
 Had some terrible
 
gaffes been made?
 
0
0
 
Still,  as I flew back to Washington,  it just didn't feel
  
that wrong.
 Something about that bizarre event had been
 
a
bsolutely resounding success.
 I confess I did hope nobody at
 
the Endowment would question me about it too closely -
-
 it had
 
been a big grant for us at the time and I felt awfully nervous
 
about accounting for so large an expenditure of public funds.
 
But although everything I could think of had indeed gone wrong,
 
something very important had gone right too,  and I kept
 
remembering the breakfast the morning after the concert, when I
 
was in the dumps but when about twenty of the singers had sat
 
hours at the table,  filling themselves with grits and sausages
 
and falling out with laughter over story after story about their
 
early singing exploits -
-
 which little country churches they had
 
sung in, how they had duded themselves up, how they had shined
 
up their shoes and their rattle-trap old cars so as to look
 
prosperous and professional, which songs they had sung, what
 
strategies they had used to put down the previous singing
 
groups, what a blast that whole life had been,  how much it had
 
meant to them...
 
W 1I,  as 1 said,  1 flew back to Washington and in the
 
fullness of time,  I closed out the grant with the proper final
 
01
 
descriptive report and all that jazz and I took several quiet
 
breaths hoping that nobody would notice that the ordinary
 
measures of success hadn't been fulfilled, that the project
 
hadn't prodouced the results that might have been expected.
 
Heck,  that I would have expected.
 I
'm no different from anybody
 
else in this culture;  I want lots and lots of big numbers to
 
validate the beauty and importance of what I help present.
 But
 
in this case,  I guess I hoped not too many people would
 
notice..,  and of all things I hoped people wouldn't think it had
 
been a failure.
 
But back in Birmingham, Douglas Seroff's thorough and
 
scholarly and fact-filled program booklet began to circulate.
 
Hank Willett made sure that a number of the most forward-looking
 
high school music programs got copies,  and he made sure also
 
that local school music teachers knew that there were several
 
African-American a cappella quartets of historical significance
 
still working in the Birmingham district,
 they began to appear
 
at a few school assembly programs and everywhere they appeared
 
they handed out copies of the program booklet.
 (There were a
 
lot left over -
 might as well get them around.)
 Doug and Hank
 
also began to establish a more solid relationship with the Black
 
disc jockeys of Birmingham,  a few of whom began to broadcast the
 
older recordings along with some new cuts from Brenda McCallum's
 
record (brought out two years after the concert) of the classic
 
Birmingham quartet singers.
 The fabled Fairfield Four Quartet
 
-10-
of Nashville that had been reunited for the Birmingham event
 
stayed reunited and began appearing together again regularly.
 
V
 
And then one day Folk Arts heard from the Florida Folklife
 
people that some folks in Jacksonville,  h on da (original home
 
of the Five Blind Boys) were interested in having an a capella
 
quartet concert too ' 
and ethnomusicologists Doris Dyen went in
 
to help work on that one.
 Her devoted and professional work
 
helped to put on a musically exciting concert that was also
  
poorly attended.
 But then folklorist David Evans'  students in
 
Memphis began to talk about a quartet concert there,  and it also
 
ultimately came to pass, with Kip Lornell and others involved.
 
I began asking my southern-based friends about the state of
 
a capella quartet singers in their areas,  and they mostly
 
reported that it was simmering along -
-
 that most groups had
 
annual home-comings,  that the younger men still went out to sing
 
in the more remote churches, that women's groups were certainly
 
not unheard of and in some areas were becoming downright
 
fashionable,  that there are still some of the old-time
 
"trainers" active who go around and put the final polishing
 
touches to the younger groups -
-
 little pieces of news like that
 
which led me to feel that on the whole this tradition is moving
 
along as one would hope it would -
 if you loved it -
 differently
 
in different places,  firmly attached to its roots but out there
 
in the sunshine too.
 Douglas Seroff put on a highly successful
 
-
11-
concert at the auditorium in Fisk University last year honoring
 
the Fairfield Four quartet,  (and that was a breakthrough event
 
)
tb
.ere-) and he is currently in negotiation with Ladysmith Black
 
Marnbazo to put on a joint a capella concert with the Sterling
 
Jubilees Quartet,  since it turns out that the two groups like
 
each other's sound.
 
Well, plainly,  this is a story that hasn't ended yet.
 Very
 
few stories do in our field.
 They aren't supposed to.
 We're
 
concerned with continuity, with on-goingness.
 ut I do think
 
there are a few lessons to be drawn from what we've seen happen
 
so far in this African-American a capella quartet singing
 
business,  ideas that might help shape some future activities.
 
Now,  I may disappoint you here by announcing that I simply am
 
not going to try to consider why the local community -
-
 black
 
and white -
-
 did not support that concert.
 Based on George
 
Bolt's and Sharon King's work in North Carolina,  I suspect that
 
certain unknown norms for successful African-American event
 
organization in Birmingham were not observed, but I don't know
 
for sure.
 I think it is equally possible to predict that the
 
- 
first few times anything is tried  it may well not be widely
 
supported -
 not until the word gets around.
 What I can outline
 
for you with some hope for accuracy are a few of the factors
 
that went into the long-range fruitfulness of the concert:
 
1
)
 The traditions celebrated had real historical depth
 
I
  
and real cultural significance and meaning -
 and it was
 
intrinsically georgeous.
 
2)
 The research into the tradition had been done with
 
great thoroughness and scholarly care,  resulting -
-
 among other
 
things -
-
 in the logical selection of Birmingham, Alabama,  a
 
major center in the development of quartet singing,  as the
 
concert site.
 (Other centers could have been chosen,  of course,
 
but this was one of the important ones.
 The concert was not
 
staged in i
pubuque,  Iowa,  or Hollywood, California,  or
 
Washington, DC.)
 
3)
 Again,  as the result of intensive research,  the
 
right singers had been invited,  the right ones in this case
 
being all the groups that had participated in the development of
 
the Birmingham style.
 Not everyone was still alive or could
 
participate, but all the
 
attempt had been made to
 
included.
 And that made
 
singers present knew that a serious
 
incude everybody who should have been
 
for an atmosphere of joyful relaxation
 
amongst the singers.
 They were having a reunion -
-
 who cared
 
about anything else.
 
4)
 The actual research was presented back to the
 
researched community in an inexpensive, profusely illustrated,
 
interesting, verifiable form.
 It is impossible to look at that
 
program booklet and not be impressed by the extraordinary story
 
of the development of quartet singing in Birmingham.
 The
 
availability of solid pains-taking scholarship has the effect of
 
empowerment to the community studied,  allowing the development
 
of legitimate pride.
 It can form a bridge,  too,  for contact
 
across caste and class lines.
 But is has to be made available,
 
and that requires major effort.
 
5
)
 And then there was a concert.
 The living singers
 
came together,  and they opened their throats and poured their
 
passion and skill and liveliness and humor out over the empty
 
hall,  and no one who heard them could ever be convinced that
 
this was a dying art.
 I am in favor of books, publications of
 
all kinds, musical transcriptions, tapes,  records,  films,  but in
 
spite of all the technological and electronic gadgetry in the
 
world,  the primary gestating act of music,  I believe, only
 
happens when musicians and listeners assemble.
 (I'm an old lady
 
now,  and I get to be old-fashioned when I want to.)
 
Well.
 Have you forgotten where I was when I started this
 
side-excursion,  this elongated ramble into the story of a single
 
event?
 I was talking about how complicated a task it is to
 
evaluate the results of work in the field of public folklore or
 
ethnomusicology,  and I brought this case up as an example.
 I
 
told you some good things about the Birmingham concert and some
 
bad things about it.
 As an event,  I still don't quite know how
 
to sum it up,  but I surely think there are some points that
 
emerged out of that whole experience that will stand us all in
 
good stead in the next such project.
 And perhaps that is what
 
real evaluation is all about because I have to admit that if I
 
looked at this event after another five years or another ten
 
years, my conclusions could well be different.
 Perhaps the best
 
thing we can do with evaluation is to extract factors or ideas,
 
or principles that we can go on with until the next time.
 And
 
the fundamental elements that strike me as key in this episode
 
are long-term dedication applied before during and after the
 
event,  and solid information (one of the two major people
 
involved knew the quartet history cold,  the other was an Alabama
 
man that knew his state.
 
At the beginning of this talk I put the evaluation problem
 
to you within a bureaucratic context,  and I complained,  in a
 
typical self-pitying bureaucratic way,  about the nonsensicalness
 
of having to work out evaluation methods.
 But evaluation is a
 
real problem and it exists out there in the real world, not just
 
in terms of governmental requirements.
 Evaluation doesn't just
 
happen on paper.
 Usually, we don't have to fill in evaluation
 
forms, but the hard fact is that we do go on evaluating our own
 
and others' work in this field continually,  and if we don't we
 
are shirking a most important responsibility.
 
And frankly,  I have to say I don't think we often do our
 
evaluating very well.
 We far too seldom look at the whole
 
I
  
outcome, good and bad; we tend to go along with given criteria
 
and formulae mostly formed out of our own prejudices; we repeat
 
each other's catchwords; we rarely look through several
 
time-depths -
-
 a most important factor; and we sometimes get a
 
slightly mean pleasure,  I
'm afraid,  in discovering each others'
 
Achilles heels.
 We're particularlyl demanding, of course, of
 
our intellectual ancestors.
 The early workers in this field,
 
lay and scholar alike,  are regularly hauled over the coals by
 
graduate students (as is traditional) but often,  too, by
 
grown-up professionals as well,  all because they can be accused
 
of lacking omniscience -
-
 that most frequent of human
 
characteristics!
 
How can we learn how to evaluate ourselves and others
 
better, by which I mean more productively, more usefully?
 Here
 
we are,  in a pitifully under-populated field,  little-known,
 
under-funded, with one of the major human tasks -
-
 the support
 
and appreciation of the mu1t1p1
4 cultures that have made our
 
planet habitable -
-
 as our primary focus.
 That might seem a
 
little bit of hyperbole but remember the inspiring story of
 
Jonathan Edwards we heard this morning.
 You may have thought
 
you were attending a conference called Sounds of the South, but
 
I assure you we could also be attendin Sounds of the Southwest
 
or the Northeast Q
V& Sounds of Portland, Oregon or sounds of the
 
Nile basin or sounds of Australia and I assure you the problems
 
discussed would Pbe exactly the same.
 Only the particulars
 
-U,--
would be different.
 And what do we do?  We too often and too
 
long revel in a child-like fashion in savaging each other
 
instead of joining to face our duties.
 We spend far too much
 
time in various kinds of quarreling,  scrabbling about,  I
'm
 
afraid for the small amount of money at the bottom of the barrel
 
-
-
 and far too little time admiring each other for the enormous
 
advances that
 
coterie.
 And
 
join together
 
have been made by our
 
under-paid, overworked
 
-
-
 most grievous sin of all -
-
 we far too seldom
 
in cross-disciplinary meetings like this, where we
 
can observe the elegance of the work done by the many component
 
parts of our world -
-
 whether they are folklorists,  recordists,
 
entrepreneurs,  librarians, concert presenters,  archivists,  small
 
record company producers, broadcasters, discographers,
 
historians, musicians,  film-makers,  anthropologists,
 
bureaucrats.
 And if I
've left anybody out here,  I
'm sorry.
 
Every one of these roles, these perspectives,  is essential.
 
We're not doing something simple.
 
And every one of these roles must be filled by persons who
 
are not only well-informed and industrious but just a little bit
 
brave too.
 Let me tell you one final story.
 Our national
 
capital, you know, wasn't always a democratic capital (small N
d 11
 
democratic).
 It was known throughout the south,  at least,  as a
 
Jim crow town for a mighty long time.
 Marian Anderson proved
 
that before the entire nation in the year of 1939.
 But do you
 
know where the first major indoor concert of indigenous
 
-
I'1-
African-American music, presented by African-American
 
traditional musicians and commented upon and introduced by
 
African-American scholars before an integrated audience was held
 
in our national capital?
 In the Coolidge Auditorium in the
 
Library of Congress,  that's where.
 
Some of you may not know about the Coolidge Auditorium.
 It
 
is a small, elegant, totally select concert space where every
 
year the Library of Congress,  acting in accordance with the
 
bequest of Mrs. Grace Coolidge, unveils its superb group of
 
Stradivarius stringed instruments in a series of concerts
 
designed to liberate the instruments from their year-long
 
silence and to elevate the spirits of the hard-pressed
 
Washington aristocratic elite.
 I don't mean to poke fun.
 My
 
brother Alan and I used to attend these concerts regularly.
 We
 
would come down from the attic where the Library of Congress
 
powers had consigned us because of the uncouth sounds we
 
listened to regularly,  and we would steep ourselves in the
 
flowing harmonies of the entire Beethoven quartet series.
 It
 
was a real education -
-
 I can tell you that.
 
But still -
-
 and this is the whole point of the story -
-
 the
 
Library of Congress was at that time represented by the
 
Librarian, Dr. George Putnam,  a small gentleman,  as I recall
 
him, quick-moving, decisive, totally aristocratic (he wore
 
pince-nez,  if I remember correctly, on a black ribbon around his
 
-Ii-
A
 
neck) -
-
 The Librarian of Congress decided to put on Josh White
 
and the Golden Gate Quartet and Dr. Sterling Brown of Howard
 
University and Dr. Allain Locke of the same and Alan Lomax in a
 
formal black-tie-and-tails concert in the Coolidge Auditorium in
 
the year of 1940 because,  as a librarian, he thought it was both
 
the scholarly and the intellectually appropriate thing to do.
 
And this was at a period when Congress was assailing the
 
Library, calling for budget cuts because of the uncouth
 
activities of the folklorists in that library who had been
 
seeking out and recording the views of criminals like Leadbelly
 
and bums like Woody Guthrie.
 
Librarians can be brave.
 They often have been and they will
 
continue to be.
 Archivists can be brave.
 Record company
 
executives can be brave.
 Musicians can be brave.
 Bureaucrats
 
can be bravpe.
 Let us try, during our few days here together,
 
to put aside our personal grievances and our personal
 
prejudices.
 Let us try to examine together bravely and
 
dispassionately the complexity of the tasks that face us and see
 
if together we cannot conceive ew ways of appropriately dividing
 
up our responsibilities so that each part of our discipline may
 
work together,  so that each one of us may perform the tasks for
 
which he or she is best suited.
 Let us try to be as brave and
 
creative and constructive as our intellectual forebears and as
 
the artists we try to serve.
 Since we don't quite know what's
 
going to happen, we might as well have at it.
 It's sure to be
 
I
 
/
 
exciting anyway -
 Archie,  don't you sometimes envy the next
 
generation?
 I do.
 Thank you.
