I: 
All right. We’re ready. And we are with A.  
P: 
Yeah. 
I: 
I’m going to jump right in. 
P: 
Okay. 
I: 
I mentioned that we are very interested in hearing the stories about your work as a PCA, and let’s start 
with your story. How did you get into this kind of work, and how long have you been doing it, and why? 
P: 
I have probably been doing this work or some part of caregiving for about 8 years. I think my initial 
reason to get into it was just seeing some different changes [1.13.46] in my parents and wanting to find out 
how could I help them, but also what could I learn to help them. And because I know they’re getting  older, and 
they’re health is really deteriorating, so I just wanna see what I can do. And so, that’s what kind of brought me 
into this work. And, I’m sorry, what was the last part? 
I: 
Just how and why did you get into it, and so you started doing it with your parents? 
P: 
Yes. My mother she was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer several years back, and so I decided I was 
going to be the one to kinda take care of her. 
I: 
And then at what point did you start doing it for other people? 
P: 
I would say I took a job in an assisted living facility. Actually, I was doing more of the cook aspect—
working in the kitchen, but I never really strayed that far from trying to help people where I was working. And 
then some people would come to you and ask, “Can you help do something for me, personally?” So, I was kind 
of getting hired on my own on the outside [laughs]. 
I: 
So, you did some private work. 
P: 
I did. Mmm hmm. 
I: 
And did you have at this point any training for the work or just learned on the job as you went? 
P: 
I would say not necessarily a lot of training at that point. Maybe just observation and watching how 
other people were doing things, and just trying to think of how I would like someone to treat me or to treat my 
family when they’re taking care of them. 
I: 
And then at some point you decided to go to work for an agency or some? 
P: 
It just started where I decided I should [1.11.49] actually start taking classes or training to make myself 
be a better caregiver, so I’m trying to think of what the first training was that I took. I think it started when I took 
a job at Senior Helpers. They started to have a lot of dementia focus, that was mostly what they did. And so, I 
started taking training through them, and then it just kind of continued on from there. 
I: 
So, you started about 8 years ago with your parents and you’re still doing it. 
P: 
Yes. 
I: 
So why? What about it—what keeps you doing this? 
P: 
I think it’s interesting. You meet so many different types of people, and a lot of people have a lot of 
interesting stories to tell especially like the older they are [laughs]. And I just—it’s a different kind of reward that 
you get from working with folks. I just feel like I didn’t necessarily get that same feeling doing this that I did with 
other jobs. I feel like it’s more rewarding.

I: 
In what way? What’s rewarding about it? 
P: 
To know that you’re helping people. Maybe family isn’t involved, and you’re the only person that they 
see on a regular basis. So, I guess it’s just being there for people that maybe someone doesn’t have someone 
or even if they do, you just kind of play a different role in their life [1.10.19]. 
I: 
So, are you currently—are you still doing some private work or is it all agency work now? 
P: 
It’s predominantly agency work. 
I: 
Okay. 
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
And over the years you’ve, I’m sure, developed relationships with clients. 
P: 
Yes. Mmm hmm. 
I: 
Are there any that stand out in your memory, some that are—maybe your favorite one or the most 
difficult one or? 
P: 
Oh, favorites. Oh, gosh. I took care of a gentleman. He was 103 when he passed, and he was a doctor 
in the Army, and he also was the medical director for Dow Chemical, so he was a very interesting person to 
care for. He had a great sense a humor, and he used to tell me stories about the war, and I just I loved going 
there, and he and his wife were married for like 75 years. They were still in love with each other, and so I would 
say he was one of my favorites. 
I: 
And what did you do for him? What kind of help did you provide? 
P: 
I did, you know, like standby assist, and also taking him to appointments, helping with medication 
reminders. Also, as his health started to decline, I would do more personal care with him. So that part was 
more about establishing trust [1.08.53]. 
I: 
About establishing trust? 
P: 
Yes. Because of their generation, they’re kind of shy with showers and those types of things. 
I: 
Can you talk a little bit more about that? I mean how did you establish trust with him so that he was 
willing to let you assist in that way? 
P: 
I think establishing trust is really listening to what the client has to say, and what they really want, and 
just being there for them and letting them know that you’re there. If there’s any concerns or anything, they can’t 
maybe tell their family, but maybe they can tell you. I would say that’s where the trust part is and reassurance 
especially when it comes to personal care ‘cause that is a very intimate thing. 
I: 
Did you assist his wife as well or how did that work? 
P: 
[Laughs] yes, I did. 
I: 
Okay. You’re laughing [laughs]. 
P: 
Well, she’s just such a character that’s why I had to laugh [laughs]. 
I: 
So, 103, wow. 
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
How about one of the most challenging clients? Have you had some challenging ones? 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Alisa G. Curtis. TC. 6.6.18
2
P: 
Yes. I’ve had some challenging clients. I would say the most challenging clients I have had are ones 
that might be CMH clients, but they’re still living independently. And maybe going into their house and not 
knowing exactly what the situation was gonna be [1.07.21]. I might get like a little write up, “Oh, this person, 
you know, might need cereal in the morning.” Well, they need a lot more than that. They’re not taking their 
medications properly or that type of thing. And I had one lady who when I got there she was having a moment 
where she had melted her med box in the oven, and she was just screaming and yelling, and she went into her 
back room and she slammed the door. She told me not to come back there, that she needed to be by herself 
[laughing], so. 
I: 
How did you handle that? 
P: 
Well, you have to stay calm because if you don’t stay calm, then it’s just gonna escalate the situation. 
So, I just gave her a few minutes, and then I just went back, and I tried to act like I just came in again, and you 
know, say is there anything you wanna talk about or do you wanna come out? And, you know, she eventually 
came out, but— 
I: 
So, are you naturally calm and patient or I mean how do you—or can you learn these—how to be calm 
and patient [laughing]? 
P: 
I think it’s a process of learning it, you know, by being on the job ‘cause each situation is so different. 
I: 
I’m guessing that a new PCA would have difficulty with some of these situations, but as they get 
practice and have to deal with different situations over time that eventually they sort of get the hang of how to 
handle each of these situations. Have you changed over the years or over the last 8 years, do you? 
P: 
Oh, yes. Yes, I have. I think what really helped with that is like the CMH training, I think, and in addition 
to the other training that I had just because I think that there’s more people out here that might have—be living 
with a mental illness or I don’t know. It’s been helpful. I think it’s helped me to be more patient and 
understanding maybe to some things that I didn’t know before. 
I: 
So, if you have a better understanding of what’s going on with them. 
P: 
Mmm hmm. That’s helpful. 
I: 
That’s helpful. 
P: 
Very helpful. 
I: 
So, you’ve mentioned training a couple of times, can you talk about the value of training? Do you—the 
importance you put on that? 
P: 
I honestly think there’s a [1.04.56] there’s a big difference from when I first started trying to do this on 
my own before training compared to now. Because I think it has, you know, besides it being written on paper, 
you can apply what you’ve learned to working, and there might be more information in there that you weren’t 
aware of when taking care of somebody. 
I: 
Is there additional training that you wish you had that you’d like to have? Things you’d like to know 
more about how to handle? 
P: 
I still think that a lot of conflict resolution—sometimes you’re just in a situation, and you may not be able 
to figure things out, and you might need somebody else to kinda help you with that.  
I: 
So, just how to handle different— 
P: 
Difficult. Yes. 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Alisa G. Curtis. TC. 6.6.18
3
I: 
--situations that might be difficult. 
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
So, can you give us a sense of the range of your job description? I know there are times when you’re 
just giving somebody cereal in the morning, or companionship or taking them to a doctor’s appointment, but at 
the other end? 
P: 
Oh, I think I’ve done a lot of things that—like Hospice care, tube feeding, helping with catheter care. I 
mean different things that—giving shots, doing things that maybe we’re not technically supposed to do, but it’s 
under the guidance of a nurse. So, I would say I’ve done just about everything—the companionship up to more 
skilled care [1.03.16]. 
I: 
Okay. You’ve had clients that have required more high-level care? 
P: 
Yes. 
I: 
Around the clock care? 
P: 
Yes. Maybe they’re having a seizure all day, so you know, you need to know how to address that 
situation with medication. I mean I think I’ve seen a lot of different cases. 
I: 
Can you think of a story or an incident/event that stands out—jumps out at you? 
P: 
[Laughing] okay. I had this young lady. I think she was in an accident because she was paralyzed from 
the neck down, and she was non-verbal, and she couldn’t move, and so her parents they just wanted a little bit 
of respite care, so we were supposed to come in. And so, there was a little bit of information left out, but she 
would giggle like all the time. She could still respond to you when you were speaking to her, so she kind of had 
a big accident and she’s a tall girl, you know, she’s like over 6’ tall. So, I’m trying to maneuver her and get her 
cleaned up before her folks come, and she’s laughing the entire time. S, you know, [laughing] just because I 
kept talking through it trying to reassure myself and reassure her that I was gonna take care of this, you know. I 
would say that was very interesting situation. I think the parents actually showed up, and I was still working on 
it [laughing] because, you know, to be able to turn a person that is like 6’ tall— 
I: 
Was she-- 
P: 
--and, you know, she can’t help you [1.01.45]. You know, you don’t get any help, so but it turned out 
okay, you know. 
I: 
So that was one sort of odd situation. 
P: 
Yes. It was very [laughing]. 
I: 
Very odd. 
P: 
And she went to Michigan State, so I’d play the UofM song for her on my phone, and she would just 
start laughing. Yeah, that was fun. 
I: 
So, good use of humor. 
P: 
Yes. 
I: 
Can you think of other things that PCAs sort of need to, you know, the tricks, little tricks? You have to 
have tricks in your bag, right? 
P: 
Yes. 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Alisa G. Curtis. TC. 6.6.18

I: 
Like playing the UofM song, getting people to laugh, trying to get them to learn to trust you. 
P: 
Yeah. 
I: 
What kinda tricks do you have? 
P: 
I think if I get an idea through a conversation, if that’s possible, find out what their likes are, and then 
kind of use that as a way to continue to open up communication with them ‘cause it’s more about what they’re 
interested in rather than what I’m interested in, and a lotta times folks are excited that somebody wants to 
listen to what they have to say or what they like [1.00.38]. 
I: 
So, it’s about building a relationship. 
P: 
Yes. 
I: 
Right. And you have ways in which you do that. You ask questions about what they like and don’t like? 
P: 
Yes. Or I look around their home and I see, oh, they’re a Detroit Tiger’s fan, you know, so I start asking 
‘em questions or have you been to a game? You know, just trying to find different ways to, you know become a 
part of their life. 
I: 
I’m gonna jump ahead just a little bit. Well, first of all, what do you like most about your job? 
P: 
Meeting all the different people ‘cause everyone has a story. 
I: 
What do you like least about your job? 
P: 
I think it’s getting better, but it’s still the pay. Sometimes the pay doesn’t necessarily fit the situation that 
you’re in. 
I: 
Can you say a little more about that? 
P: 
Well, since there’s such a shortage of nurses and other skilled care people that come into the home, 
sometimes we’re put in a position where we have to do that work. So, but we’re not getting paid accordingly. 
You know, we’re kind of at the lower end of the pay scale. 
I: 
Do you—are you able to make ends meet? I mean because it’s not—it’s about the pay definitely being 
too, but you also need a certain number of hours, right? 
P: 
Right. 
I: 
In order to make ends meet? 
P: 
Right. 
I: 
I understand that a number of PCAs have to kind of piece different jobs together.  
P: 
Yes. You do. 
I: 
Are you in that situation? 
P: 
I would say it depends. You know, sometimes I feel like I’m doing really well financially, and other times 
not so much because maybe your client passes, you know, you’ve had the same person. You’ve had steady 
hours for a long period of time, and then all of a sudden, those hours are gone. So then, you have to figure out 
a way to supplement that [58.33] 
I: 
Do you have any other source of income in the house I mean? You know, like another person that— 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Alisa G. Curtis. TC. 6.6.18
5
P: 
Yes. Mmm hmm. 
I: 
Okay. So, you’re not completely reliant on just your own salary— 
P: 
Right. 
I: 
--which must help a little bit. 
P: 
Yes. It does. 
I: 
Okay. I’m gonna jump ahead just a little bit because I know you mentioned earlier that a lot of times 
you’ll go into a client’s house, and you don’t really know what to expect. 
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
You’re not really sure what you’re getting into, right? 
P: 
Right. 
I: 
You get a little piece of paper that says he needs cereal. 
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
So, in listening to all of the stories that we’ve been hearing, PCAs have run into a lot of different things. 
P: 
Yes [laughing]. 
I: 
I’m just gonna throw a few of those scenarios out, and you let me know if you’ve experienced these 
things. 
P: 
Okay. 
I: 
Have you every walked into a house where you didn’t feel prepared? Like it was pretty clear that it 
required above your skill level? That you didn’t have the skills needed to provide the care needed? 
P: 
Yes. 
I: 
Can you tell me a story about that? 
P: 
It was a couple. The lady was a retired nurse [57.17], and her husband was a retired doctor. And he 
had cancer, and it was just—I didn’t feel like I was prepared to do a lot of things that the wife wanted me to 
do—caring for her husband, and I didn’t feel like I got a good description in my care plan about exactly what I 
was going to be doing. So, there was a lot more lifting. He was dead weight, and just the way she wanted 
things done was not I would say what I was used ‘cause I think she just wanted to still be in charge of 
everything and show me how she wanted things done. But I was very unprepared in that situation. 
I: 
And so, what was goin’ through your mind? And how did it play out? 
P: 
I just kept thinking, oh, please just let things work out, you know, so that I can still come here and help 
this gentleman.  
I: 
And so, did you keep going back? 
P: 
I did. I kept. Mmm hmm. 
I: 
And how does this story end? I mean did you learn how to take care of him, and then you felt more 
comfortable or? 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Alisa G. Curtis. TC. 6.6.18

P: 
I did learn how to take care of him, but I think it was more about listening to what he wanted me to do in 
some way, you know, versus what his wife wanted me to do. They had two different ideas of, you know. 
I: 
So, then you started to do what he wanted you to do? 
P: 
Yes. Yes. 
I: 
And what was her reaction? 
P: 
I think she was still gonna do whatever anyways, but I spent a majority of the time with him, so I just 
wanted to make sure he was comfortable because he was in the end stages of the cancer [55.32]. 
I: 
Okay. So, you hung in there, and when something like that happens do you talk to—do you have 
supervisors that you can talk to or? 
P: 
You’re hopeful that you can talk to your supervisor about it. I’m not quite sure sometimes how helpful 
that is, unfortunately. Yeah. 
I: 
Let me throw out a couple of other scenarios. We can do another one here. So, the gentleman you 
were just talking about, it sounded like he passed on. 
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
I’m sure you get attached to some of these clients. How do you deal with the fact that they die? Like 
when a client dies? 
P: 
Sometimes it’s really hard depending on your relationship with them. You feel like you should be able to 
leave your job and leave all those emotions behind, but it doesn’t always happen. Sometimes you take that 
with you. I mean there’s people I still think about. 
I: 
Can you tell us about one of the people that you got close enough with that it was really hard for you 
when they passed? 
P: 
It was lady that I was taking care of for over a year. She had very [laughing] fun personality so to speak, 
and we just—I think we got really close over time, and she didn’t really pass until she went into the nursing 
home, so I’m the one that took her to the nursing home, got her all set up, and I felt like I was abandoning her, 
you know, yeah. She didn’t last— 
I: 
How do you deal with those feelings? 
P: 
It’s really not that easy, so sometimes you just talk to other people who do the same kind of work that 
you do ‘cause they kind of understand where you’re coming from [53.29]. 
I2: 
Are there support groups or are there—is there a community? 
P: 
I wouldn’t necessarily say there’s support groups that I know of, but the community is more about the 
other people you meet on the job and sharing stories. 
I2: 
You have a unique perspective because you started talking about you started caring for your parents 
first, can you talk a little bit about how it’s different caring for your parents versus clients? 
P: 
Well, when you’re caring for your family members I would say there’s less boundaries there. You may 
express more emotion than you typically would with a client or express your feelings more. Maybe it’s 
frustration, that type of thing. Whereas when you’re working with someone, you kind of have to keep those 
things under control. Like, you’re not really supposed to be expressing those things, or the boundaries. I have 
more boundaries with my clients than I do with my family, definitely. 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Alisa G. Curtis. TC. 6.6.18
7
I2: 
These are boundaries that you establish yourself as best practices from your work? 
P: 
Yes. 
I2: 
Okay. 
I: 
Do you get some guidance on the boundaries from the agencies that you work for? 
P: 
Some of the agencies have had some training on boundaries, so that’s been helpful as well. 
I: 
So, I know that a lot of the policies and procedures are in place to keep—one of the goals is to keep the 
clients safe. 
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
But we also want the PCAs to be safe. 
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
So, have there ever been a time when you’ve been injured, or do you worry about being injured? 
P: 
Yes. I would say lifting people where it’s a two-person assist, at least that’s the way I was initially 
taught, and sometimes when you’re in the home it doesn’t happen that way.  
I: 
‘Cause you’re the only one there. 
P: 
Right, or maybe the person that’s helping you lift doesn’t know how to lift properly, so then there’s room 
for injury there, too. 
I: 
So, how do you handle that? 
P: 
I try to talk to the person. If there’s someone assisting me, I try to maybe show them how we could 
properly lift this person without either one of us getting hurt. And also, I have bought a belt that I use for lifting 
that I wear myself. 
I: 
That you wear yourself? 
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
I’m not familiar with that. I know about the gait belts for the clients, but not for you— 
P: 
Oh, I just went to like Menards or something, you know, like a belt that you might see somebody 
wearing in a warehouse—that type of thing. 
I: 
All right. Okay. 
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
Okay. I wanna ask you a question but feel free to tell me you don’t want to talk about these things, but 
you self-identified as Native American. 
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
Okay, and I’m just wondering—and I don’t know how steeped in your culture you are, but you know, 
can you talk a little bit about that? Does that—I don’t know if you’re really involved in a Native American 
community or? 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Alisa G. Curtis. TC. 6.6.18

P: 
Well, the tribe that I belong to is in the Petoski area, so I mean I can only do so much there. But if they 
have any events or anything going on here, locally, ‘cause there’s another tribe here, then I try to attend those 
events, and I’m trying to learn more about the culture, like, through my mom. 
I: 
So, I’m just wondering if there are some cultural differences about care of older adults in the Native 
American community versus— 
P: 
I would say there’s a little bit more respect for elders [49.38]. We, you know, [inaudible] with elders in 
the Native American culture. Like you take people in, you know, your family members, and you take care of 
‘em. 
I: 
Are there any Native Americans that you care for as clients? 
P: 
I have one lady. 
I: 
Do you? 
P: 
Mmm hmm. I really like her. 
I: 
Does that change anything that you can think of? Maybe you can do a better job of asking these 
questions? 
I2: 
Nope. Yeah. I was just gonna hop in, you know. We just have a couple more minutes on this section, 
but I want to draw another correlation to you taking care of your parents when they were in need, and then like 
I’m sure the Native American population there is of similar need. Not everyone can take care of their parents. 
P: 
Right. 
I2: 
Or do you find that in the Native American population or in your tribe every elder is cared for as a 
responsibility by their children? 
P: 
I’m just speaking from personal experience what I’ve seen. If there is an elder in need, then someone’s 
going out to do something for that person to make sure they have food, to make that they can get to their 
appointments, to make sure that they’re okay in their home. There is a sense of community especially within 
like a tribal government part because they really wanna make sure that people are being taken care of, and 
there’s lots of programs that they provide for elders, so I’d say it’s a [47.58]. 
I: 
We’re gonna pause, but you know I know people’s backgrounds in culture and ancestry, you bring all of 
that to the work that you do, right? And I mean I do, I know K does, so I was just curious about the, you know, 
what from your Native American culture, history, background do you bring to the work if anything? 
P: 
I would just say it would be being really caring and trying to be accepting of lots of different people. I 
mean that’s what I’ve always seen from my mom. You know, she would take a stranger in off the street if she 
had to, you know, to make sure they were okay. So, I would just say that sense of welcoming people in and 
trying to be—trying to help people. 
I: 
We’re gonna stop there. Actually, I’m gonna keep these going, but K’s going to stop. You’re doing 
great. 
P: 
Oh, gosh, I’m like [panting sound] [laughing]. 
I: 
You’re doing really, really well. 
I2: 
You’re doing wonderful. Take a deep breath. 
I: 
Yeah. I know.

P: 
I could never be on TV. 
I2: 
I know that we are two strangers and there is this equipment around us, and that makes an impact. But 
essentially this is just us sitting at a coffee table talking about your life. 
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I2: 
And there’s a lot of things that are very natural to. You already said several of those things, and the 
reason we’re asking follow-up questions is because a lot of people that don’t know what you do and don’t 
understand the burden, and we want to just humanize that with your stories. You especially have a unique 
perspective, so yeah, that’s why we’re doing it like this. 
P: 
Okay. 
I: 
And just to tag onto that, what I’m hoping to do is on several of these interview [45.52] to circle back 
and maybe do a secondary phone interview, especially after I read the transcripts ‘cause I’ll be reading those, 
and I’ll go, oh, wow! I missed that! You know, I should have followed up on that during the interview, so if 
you’re interested, you know, I might want to circle back. The second reason I’m circling back to people is 
because—at least to a few of the interviewees—is because we are as K said, trying to humanize you and the 
work that you do, and put a face to, you know the PCAs. And I feel like in order to do that we should be 
learning not just about your work, but who you are as a person, because we want to be able to say, hey, this is 
a human being here [laughing], you know. 
P: 
Right. 
I: 
And she’s not just about being a PCA, she’s also a daughter, a sister, whatever you are. You know, a 
member of the Native American tribe, and which tribe is it by the way? 
P: 
It’s Odawa. 
I: 
Odawa. Okay. So, we want people to know that you’re a human being. 
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
With a whole life and a history, so we’re just trying to sort of fill out the picture a little. 
P: 
Okay. 
I: 
Does that make sense? 
P: 
It makes sense. It’s just you’re not used to it [laughing]. 
I: 
Yeah. If somebody is asking me all of these questions, it would feel so weird. 
P: 
No. Well, it just feels like a lotta times—I don’t know [44.08], like you said there’s just I think a thought 
process of what we do, so people don’t actually—I don’t know if they just don’t want to know what we really do 
or how we think. We’re not always asked those questions. 
I: 
Have you ever been asked these questions? 
P: 
Not really, no [laughing]. 
I: 
Because we get that quite a bit. People will say, “Nobody’s ever asked us these questions.” 
P: 
Right. 
I: 
But you have something to say, right.

P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
So, this is good, right. Okay. 
I2: 
About to be ready. Okay. We’re ready. 
I: 
Okay. I’m gonna throw out a few more scenarios. 
P: 
Okay.  
I: 
You let us know if you’ve had this experience or not, and how you handled it. We just said that, you 
know, people don’t usually show an interest in the work, and you don’t know if it’s because they don’t, they 
don’t—it’s not relevant to them, but have you ever had somebody ask you, “Well, what do you for a living?” 
And then you start to tell them, and what kind of reaction do you get? 
P: 
I think it depends on who’s asking, and to be honest with you I think the general public probably it’s the 
ones that might not respond the way you would think they would respond to you tellin’ em. They always say, 
“Oh, I could never do that. It takes a special kind of person to do that.” You know, whereas you might be talking 
to your doctor or somebody in the medical field, and they’ll say—they have more of an understanding of what 
you do, and I think they’ll even say they appreciate it or thank you for doing it, that type of response, so it’s a 
little bit different [42.10] 
I: 
Okay. Have you ever walking into a situation where you felt unsafe? 
P: 
Mmm [pause], yes. 
I: 
Can you tell us about that one? 
P: 
I think it was more of a different place I was working. It was like a mmm—people would come from 
Center One over here at the hospital where they’d be coming out of jail, so I was working there at the time. And 
you would get to read their file before the patient actually came or your client came in, so there were a couple 
cases with gentlemen that, you know, I kinda felt a little bit uncomfortable just because of their history with 
women. So. 
I: 
And then once you met them, did you continue to feel uncomfortable or was it okay? 
P: 
It was okay, but you definitely have to set a precedence in the beginning with folks, especially after you 
read certain things because there’s a way that they can lean to manipulate the situation or manipulate you. 
I: 
Can you give us an example? You said you have to set the tone in the beginning, how do you do that? 
P: 
Sometimes they would say [laughing]—some of the folks would say, “I can’t read what you’re thinking. 
What are you thinking? You look like a psychiatrist sitting there like that.” You know, ‘cause those were—we 
had a lot of different types of clients there, but I always try to stay professional and stay where the boundaries 
were definitely set because sometimes people would keep coming in the office, and they wanted to, like, be 
friends, and they wanted you to take ‘em places and do things that they knew we’re not allowed to do. So, you 
always had to be just like no. You know, these are the rules, and you need to follow the rules. 
I: 
So, boundaries a little more rigid? 
P: 
Yes. Yes. 
I: 
Have you ever been in a situation where you had unwanted sexual advances or inappropriate sexual 
behavior? 
P: 
Uh, yes. Yes.

I: 
Yes? 
P: 
Yes [laughing]. It’s interesting with men as they age so to speak. I think that they might think it’s okay to 
just say whatever is on their mind at the moment. You know, a lotta times you’re asked to be their girlfriend or, 
you know, they wanna be touchy/feely with you, and you know, you always have to say I’m your caregiver first 
or I’m here to take care of you. You know, and nothing else. 
I: 
So that’s how you handle it? 
P: 
Yes. 
I: 
And does that always work? 
P: 
It works most of the time [39.12], especially if you don’t start hugging ‘em and, you know, being 
touchy/feely with ‘em too much to begin with. Then they’re not gonna have something to go on because 
sometimes they honestly think that you’re their girlfriend [laughs]. 
I: 
So, you’ve learned some tricks there. 
P: 
Yes. 
I: 
On what to say, and how to deflect it. 
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
Have you—I know you’ve worked with a lot of different families over the years. 
P: 
Yes. 
I: 
Probably had some wonderful family members, and they you’ve had probably the other extreme. 
P: 
Yes. 
I: 
Can you share maybe a story from each, you know, what comes to mind when you think of a wonderful 
family member or family? 
P: 
I would say the one couple that I was telling you about that I took care of. They’re the ones that are 
over 100. Their family was very involved in their life and in their care and what they wanted, and they treated 
all of us very well. It was nice to see how involved they were in their parents’ care, and how they wanted that 
communication to be open with us. So, I never felt like there was something that I couldn’t take to them—a 
concern or. 
I: 
It’s probably—well, maybe it’s not. I was gonna say it’s probably kind of unusual to have a client that 
has no family members, but maybe you do? You have a number of clients that have no family members? 
P: 
Yes. And like I said, unfortunately, it happens more when I’ve worked CMH-type clients. The family 
sometimes is none existent, and the person may ask, you know, “Can I call my mom or my sister?” And then it 
may say in their plan, the sister doesn’t want you to call or want them to call. So, yeah. It’s sad [37.14]. 
I: 
So, what do you say in a situation like that? 
P: 
We try to change the subject, perhaps, and say, well, maybe now is not a good time to call your sister. 
Maybe we’ll try later, or maybe you can write her a letter or do something else, you know, depending on how 
much they’re asking about a person. 
I: 
So, the ones that do have family members, that has to sort of change the dynamics because you’re 
dealing with the family as well as the client, right? 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Alisa G. Curtis. TC. 6.6.18
12
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
Can you talk about family dynamics a little bit? 
P: 
I think on a lot of people don’t see their parents or their family members like we see them. They may 
see that person, “Oh, that’s 20 years ago. They were healthy. They did all this. They worked, you know, they 
were fun. Now, they’re not fun.” You know, and they don’t understand the changes that are going on, so 
sometimes that’s an issue. 
I: 
And how have you learned to work with families—all different families—you’ve got all these different 
kinds of families? 
P: 
Oh, it’s not very easy sometimes. 
I: 
No? 
P: 
No. Some families they already have it in their mind of how they think things are gonna be or how 
things are going when you’re caring for their family member, but it’s not really like that. So, you have to just try 
to find ways to talk to them maybe about things and make maybe slight suggestions on things. Like maybe it’s 
their diet or maybe they’re not taking their medication the way they should. You know, you just have to figure 
out loop holes so to speak to be able to talk to family members. 
I2: 
If you were to share some best practices on dealing with that kind of conflict where family wants 
something else to happen, and you want something else to happen, or you’re supposed to lead the care in a 
different direction, what are some things you would advise other PCAs—young PCAs—from your experience? 
P: 
I would definitely advise, if it’s possible, to shadow somebody who might have more experience than 
you do or to go into a situation that you’re not familiar with, with someone that you can shadow [34.58] 
because I think that that makes a difference because I think some people if they’re put into a situation they’re 
not familiar with, it may scare them off, especially some of the younger ones [laughing]. 
I: 
Have you had family—how do family members approach you? I mean we’ve been talking about how 
you approach family members, but we’ve also heard stories about how family members feel about the PCA?  
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
Can you speak to that? 
P: 
Sometimes, you know, they’ll wanna call you and talk to you personally about their family member, or 
they may even try to recruit you outside of the agency. The just—I don’t know—I think I’ve had fairly good 
experience with family members, if I can say I don’t recall any particular situation where it went too bad 
[laughing]. 
I: 
That’s good. I’m glad to hear that. So, well, I had two more scenarios. What about dogs? You know, 
just the physical environment, going in—you must have seen a huge range of physical environments from 
really super nice homes to— 
P: 
Yes. I went into a home, it was a young lady. I walked in and all I smell is dog feces and urine, and I’m 
thinking what’s going on here? And I see a dog run set up in her living room, and she had a leash that went 
outside, and I’m thinking what’s going on here. And I look, and there’s like a trail of dog feces all in the dog run 
[laughing]. I’m just trying to figure out what’s going on here [laughs]. 
I: 
What was going on? 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Alisa G. Curtis. TC. 6.6.18
13
P: 
She thought that that was acceptable for her dog to go to the bathroom inside, and that it wasn’t gonna 
affect anybody else that came into the home. So, of course, I call the office [laughing] ‘cause I’m thinking 
[32.59] how can I breath in here, and this isn’t healthy for her as well. You know— 
I: 
What did the office say? 
P: 
[Laughing] they were a little bit shocked. I don’t think sometimes—not all of the clients get an 
assessment at home by the agencies. Like, maybe it’s their caseworker that goes in, and then they send 
information back, but there’s been plenty of times where no one from the office has actually been to the 
locations. 
I2: 
I feel like every scenario we’ve presented you’ve had a great story about, and that [laughing] continues 
to impress me. And it shows your experience, and that’s really what we’re after. I just wanted to make that 
comment. Thank you for your [inaudible – laughing [32.13]. 
I: 
Well, and I want to hear the rest of that story. How did you deal with that? 
P: 
Oh, it was a very interesting shift. You know, they asked me would you please at least try to finish the 
shift. I said I will try to finish this shift. So, I just—unfortunately, she was very paranoid anyways, so she 
would—she took her dog and they went in the back, and I’m just trying to breath, and do I mean she had 
dishes stacked up to the ceiling. Everything was just a debacle there, and she had a sign that said I need help, 
you know, and I’m thinking, well, what does this sign mean. I mean there was just so  many different things 
going on at that house, but I did the shift. 
I: 
You did the shift. 
P: 
[Laughing] 
I: 
Did you ever go back? 
P: 
I tried not to go back. Mmm hmm. 
I2: 
On that topic, though, what keeps you coming back in general, maybe not to that client [inaudible]? 
P: 
Well, it is never boring. It’s never the same thing every day, and if it is—I don’t know. I don’t know if I 
could necessarily just sit and do the same thing every day. 
I: 
It sounds like every day is different. 
P: 
Yes. It’s an adventure [group laughter]. 
I: 
The last one on my list is about belief systems that maybe don’t match your own whether it’s, you know, 
people who have a different view on sexual orientation or race or culture or politics— 
P: 
Oh, yes. 
I: 
--anything? 
P: 
Politics I try to keep at the door. You know, if someone starts bringing up, “Oh, what do you think about 
this person or that person?” I’m just like, you know what, I don’t feel comfortable talking about that, or that’s 
something I don’t wanna discuss. And as far as race, yes, that comes up as a topic frequently because of 
where I live. I mean this is a population of predominantly, you know, white people, and just like yesterday went 
to a new client. He’s like, “Are you a citizen of the United States?” And I’m thinking very much so [laughing], so 
I tried to state it in a nice way, you know, ‘cause you get that sometimes [29.57]. 
I: 
You said frequently?

Alisa G. Curtis. TC. 6.6.18

P: 
[Laughing] depends on the person, but yeah, it’s interesting. People just come out and ask you, “Are 
you married?” I mean there’s just all these questions that they come up with. 
I: 
So, anything super offensive or that you’ve had to respond to, you know, that you’ve had to sort of put 
up with or maybe not? 
P: 
Mmm I would say it’s more those types of questions about— 
I: 
Just curiosity. 
P: 
Yeah, about my race, you know, like, you know, “Who are you or what are you, “ or whatever. And I’m 
thinking, really? Okay. [laughing] I’m here to help you, you know. 
I: 
So, you just explain it and move on. 
P: 
Right., and I’m hoping that that would be enough. You know, and if it was an issue, then I would just 
call the office and say, you know what, this client isn’t comfortable with me being here, so I think someone else 
should come. 
I: 
I do—do we have a second. I’m thinking about the last—one of the last interviews we did. You 
mentioned being up here in this area. We’re in snow country, right. 
P: 
Yes. 
I: 
How do you handle the winters just like if there’s a snow storm, how do you get to your clients? How do 
you--? 
P: 
Oh, I have snow tires, but other than that sometimes it’s an issue. You get to someone’s house, and it 
hasn’t been plowed at all, and they could have a driveway that’s like 2 miles long [28.34], and you’re thinking 
how am I gonna get up there? 
I: 
Yeah. How do you? 
P: 
Very carefully, so you have to, like, call the office, usually, and say, hey, I can’t even get into the client’s 
driveway. You know, so sometimes they have to call the client and find out why the driveway hasn’t been 
plowed or serviced. And then you can’t get the client out to appointments or anything else when the weather’s 
like that, so that’s an issue of being extremely careful ‘cause it’s not just yourself, it’s someone else with you. 
And some folks are scared of the weather. They don’t wanna go out when they’re afraid to fall. 
I: 
You’re not scared of the weather? It’s like the postman, you’re rain, shine, snow you always show up? 
P: 
[Laughing] I try to show up as much as I can for the job, and you know, clients pick up on a lot of things, 
so if you come in and you’re anxious, and you’re feeling a certain way, it’s almost like they can pick up on that. 
So, you know, you have to reassure them again. We’ll get to your appointment. Everything’s gonna be okay. 
I’m here to help you. 
I: 
You have to convey calmness— 
P: 
Yes, you do. 
I: 
--so that they’ll be calm. 
P: 
Yes. Mmm hmm. 
I: 
All right. Are we pausing here? 
I2: 
Perfect. 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018

I: 
I threw all these scenarios out, but there’s probably some like huge scenario that I’m missing. 
P: 
Well, it was one gentleman that I was taking care of— 
I2: 
One second [laughing] yeah. 
I: 
Yeah. ‘Cause he wants to catch this one too. I’m catching it here, but I’ll ask it again in a minute. 
I2: 
Go ahead. 
I: 
Now? 
I2: 
Yeah. 
I: 
Okay. So, I’ve thrown out a bunch of scenarios, but I should allow you to choose your own scenarios. Is 
there a scenario that jumps out that I’ve missed? 
P: 
There was one gentleman that I was taking care of. I had known him, already working at the facility that 
I was working at. And then I started doing more care for him [26.29]. Well, he was very, very ill, and it was just 
a different—we had a really good relationship together. I knew what he wanted, and what he needed when I 
was there and how to care for him. Well, he was not very happy when the agency started sending different 
people in, and that’s another thing that people don’t understand. It’s like they need consistency especially if it’s 
somebody that they’re comfortable with, and so I continued to care for him, and then the closer it got to him 
passing away, his family just came out of the woodwork. People that you didn’t see at all because he had 
money, and that’s a very common thing. And you know, he said to me, “I only want you here. I can only trust 
you. I only want you here.” So, I tried to figure out ways to talk to the family about me still coming there, and 
they just said, “No. We’re taking over from here. It doesn’t matter what he wants. You know, we’re in charge.” 
And it was very difficult situation ‘cause once again I felt like, okay, I’m not doing my job the way I want to do it. 
I want to be here with this gentleman until he passes. 
I: 
And you weren’t able to be there? 
P: 
No. The family pushed us out. 
I: 
So, how does that make you feel? What’s goin’ through your mind right now? 
P: 
It makes me feel sad because, [holding back tears] when people are at that point in their life, you know 
they’re at the end, they might ask you for forgiveness or tell you some secret maybe they don’t tell anyone. 
And so, you kinda feel like, you know, you’re not validating them enough. And, I guess that’s the part that’s 
hard when the family doesn’t see what you’re seeing. 
I: 
Thank you for sharing that story. I was going to ask you, what would be the most heartbreaking case, 
but I think maybe you’ve just shared it? 
P: 
Oh, there’s lots of ‘em, unfortunately. 
I: 
I feel like we should pause there [laughs]. Yeah. That’s gotta be hard. I’m sensing that you’ve felt like 
that wasn’t the best thing for him. 
P: 
Right. 
I: 
Which is one of the reasons why it was so hurtful to you. 
P: 
Right. 
I: 
You didn’t feel like his last moments were gonna be— 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Alisa G. Curtis. TC. 6.6.18
16
P: 
Honored, what he wanted [23.38]. 
I: 
--or that they would be as good as they could have been. 
P: 
Right. 
I: 
If you had been there or if they had been different people. 
P: 
Right. 
I: 
Yup. Yeah. That’s a hard one. 
P: 
And you have people asking you if you can change their will for them because they don’t want their 
certain kids to get money. I mean you get put in a lot of awkward positions [laughing]. 
I: 
That is awkward. 
P: 
Yes. 
I: 
That’s sort of an understatement. Are you ready? 
I2: 
Yeah. I’m about to be ready in just a second. 
I: 
Okay. I have so many things I wat to ask. 
I2: 
Fair enough. 
I: 
As he gets going, I think one of my earlier questions—one of the things I was alluding to in terms of 
family members, their perception of you is we’ve had a number of personal care workers say that families 
make certain assumptions about personal care workers. 
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
Like they can’t trust them or, you know, they’re worried about that you might steal something, or they’re 
worried that you’re doin’ something that they can’t. You know, and that makes them feel bad or—do you 
experience any of that? 
P: 
I do sometimes, and think sometimes they might think [laughs] that we’re just there to be a 
housekeeper, and it’s like, you know, we do lots of different things, and sometimes you have to kind of say, 
hey, what do you need me to do? But this is also what I’m allowed to do because we do have boundaries 
within our job as well. You know, like we can’t [21.51] be on a super tall ladder, you know, getting something 
down. Just sometimes I think that they just don’t know what we’re doing—why we’re really there, and so 
sometimes you have to kind of explain it the best way you can. 
I: 
Mmm hmm. So, we’re gonna switch gears a little bit, but that’s a great segue because I want to talk 
about sort of the bigger context, social context, and political, and the way society values—perceives the work 
that you do. 
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
How do you feel when people say, “You’re just a PCA?” 
P: 
I just try to stick up for myself and say, you know, I feel like I’m more than that. You know, I’m in a 
relationship with these people at the time that I’m caring for them that maybe other people are not, and so I 
don’t like to have the feeling that I’m gonna be devalued by what someone else may say because I’m the one 
that’s living and doing that job. 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Alisa G. Curtis. TC. 6.6.18
17
I: 
Do you feel society places low-value on the work that you do? I mean I don’t want to assume that you 
feel that way. 
P: 
I think sometimes, but then sometimes people are like, like I said before, you know, like, “Oh, I could 
never do that,” or “Why do you do it?” You know, you get—sometimes it opens up conversation for questions, 
you know, but as far as if somebody were to say something bad about it, you know, I still take pride in what I 
do. So, I’m not really gonna let that change what I’m doing. 
I: 
You may not have experienced this. Again, I don’t want to make assumptions, but I know I hear often 
people referring to the work as, you know, just a PCA, or referring to it as a low-skilled or unskilled, which how 
do you feel about that? How do you react to that? 
P: 
I kinda make corrections because, you know, I’d say a lot of the things that I do [19.35] are skilled, and 
then, you know, they may say, “Well, you’re not a nurse.” Well, you know, I work with nurses all the time in my 
job. So, like I said, I really don’t let anyone else set any standards for what I’m doing.  
I: 
You mentioned that some people say, “I could never do that work.” 
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
Which implies that, you know, you have some skills that they don’t feel they have [laughs]. 
P: 
Right. 
I: 
What skills do you think it takes to be a PCA? 
P: 
I think understanding—like you have to sometimes put yourself in the position of the person that needs 
to care. You know, most of the time they haven’t always been the way they are at the time you’re caring for 
them, so you have to be openminded, and patient, and understanding, you know, to other peoples’ needs. And 
don’t always assume you know something about that person. 
I: 
So, one of the reasons, among others, that we have a shortage, is because of the working conditions—
the low wages, the lack of guaranteed hours. 
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
Things like that, right. 
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
The low social value, not feeling respected. A lot of PCAs don’t feel like they get the respect that they 
should be getting. How do you see this changing? How are we gonna fix this? 
P: 
I think a good way to fix it [17.54] is by starting like if you’re working for a company, if you could just like 
switch roles for a couple minutes [laughing] so that maybe people in the office actually see what you’re really 
doing. I mean it’s different when you’re telling somebody over the phone. Okay. Walk into the house. This is 
what’s going on versus when they’re there ‘cause sometimes they’ll tell you, “Oh, you can do it. It’s not that—
you know, it’s fine.” Well, you’re not here. You know, I can’t do this. You know, I need help. 
I: 
That’s a great suggestion. What should we be telling younger people or who people who aren’t doing 
this kind of work right now, how do we get more people doing this kind of work? How do we entice younger 
people into this profession? 
P: 
I think, like, if you’re gonna start younger, like, maybe high school, if there was a program set up—I 
don’t know if it’s called family dynamics, say. You know, that you take a group of people who might be 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Alisa G. Curtis. TC. 6.6.18
18
interested in going in and, you know, playing cards with seniors, you know, for an afternoon or something. Or if 
they’re interested in healthcare further on, I think that that’s a good starting point because I’ve met a lot of 
people who just skip over working necessarily with seniors and people with disabilities, and they go right into 
school, and then they’re right into the hospital or wherever they’re at. So, they don’t have that baseline to work 
from. 
I2: 
A follow-up question, what do you think that we can learn from your tribe’s practices on elder care in 
that regard? Instilling that need and that interest? 
P: 
I don’t necessarily know if that can be [laughing] learned ‘cause I know that there are a lot of different 
cultures that respect folks as they get older. I think, unfortunately, it’s just a lot of that thought process is just 
here in the United States to put people aside, and I think that education is the only way to really get people to 
understand what it’s like to age or to have a disability. 
I: 
So, it’s not just education about how to become a PCA or anything— 
P: 
Right. 
I: 
--it’s just education about aging in general. 
P: 
Yes. 
I: 
Familiarizing people with— 
P: 
Right. Getting different— 
I: 
--older adults— 
P: 
--groups of people, different ages together ‘cause sometimes I think we have a tendency. Like I feel like 
now because of this work, I have friends that are 70 and 80 yeas old, and they’re not my client. You know, it 
kinda opens up your mind as to being friends with different people. 
I: 
What would you recommend to agencies? What changes could agencies make? 
P: 
First of all, I would like to see it not so easy to open up an agency that has no medical background 
[14.52], whatsoever. That it’s more than just a business. It’s more than making profit. It’s somebody’s life. So, 
that is a huge concern for me ‘cause I’ve worked for enough people that do not have a medical background 
versus when I have worked there’s—it’s just done—the business is run differently. 
I: 
So, you ‘ve seen a range of agencies in terms of motivations— 
P: 
Yes. 
I: 
--and best practices. 
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
So, regulate the industry more? 
P: 
Yes. 
I: 
That’s one big recommendation. 
P: 
Right. And then you might actually draw in more people of—better people or people that really want to 
do the job, and if the pay and work the business is really about—if those two things matched up, ‘cause I’ve 
had a lot of friends who’ve left the business because they don’t like the practices that are going on.

I: 
So, it’s not just about the pay. Pay is important. 
P: 
Yes. It’s not just about the pay [13.43]. 
I: 
But it’s not just about the pay. It’s about how the business is run. 
P: 
Mmm hmm or not run [laughs]. 
I: 
Or not run. Can you give an example, you know, friends who have left businesses? What kind of 
business practices were they objecting to? 
P: 
Well, unfortunately, if there’s a private pay client, they get precedence over somebody that’s a state 
funded client. I mean the agency may have never even been over to that person’s home or never even really 
spoken with that person unless a state agency client, and they have no idea about anything about this client, 
and they may say, “Oh, well, we’re only getting $13 from the state for this person, so it’s doesn’t really matter. 
We need to have the private pay person covered first.” And in my mind, it doesn’t matter. People need help, 
they need help. It has nothing to do with their personal finances. That’s the way I feel. 
I: 
So, pretend for a second that I’m the governor sitting here or the president or something with a lot of 
fancy power that can, you know, wave a wand and change things—change the laws—change the labor 
conditions, what do you wanna say to me? 
P: 
I would say that just like in a nursing home there needs to be someone overseeing how these agencies 
do things. How they’re taking care of their staff, how they’re taking care of the clients. Like there needs to be 
someone else coming in having eyes on them as well, so that things are done right. I mean if it’s a nursing 
home, you know, the state’s gonna come in and give you citations for things. Assisted living is a little bit lax in 
that area, too, but I think that to make care better, there needs to be some oversight with someone. 
I: 
With the homecare— 
P: 
With power— 
I: 
--agencies. 
P: 
Yes.  
I: 
So, let’s say I, again, I’m some fancy policy maker, and I don’t understand that—I don’t even realize 
there’s a shortage of direct care workers or why that’s even important. Why are the direct care workers so 
important? 
P: 
I think we’re important because we’re filling in where other people can’t. You know, we’re doing a job 
maybe that they can’t do, or they don’t want to do. So, I mean I feel like we’re very important, and some people 
don’t wanna be in a facility. They wanna be at home [11.05]. 
I: 
So, you would try to explain the work that you’re doing is important. 
P: 
Yes. 
I: 
And you need to pay attention to what we’re doing. What would say in terms of making the job more—
what’s the word I’m looking for? Just appealing to people to try and address the shortage? 
P: 
Gosh, like I said, I think it would be more of [sigh] just—I mean you have to be a little be honest about 
what the job is like, but also just telling people how important it is to help others. And to show that we’re not just 
there to do dishes or, you know, take out the trash. We’re actually there for a lot of different reasons, and that it 
can be a rewarding field to go into. It’s not all negatives. You know, there are positives from it.

I: 
Is there anything I’m not asking? Is there something on your heart, on your mind, that you would like to 
share that I haven’t asked about? 
P: 
I think that there should be a voice from the—actually people that we’re taking care of [9.40]. I feel like 
sometimes maybe they’re not—they’re kind of overlooked, like no one’s really asking them—outside of their 
family maybe, you know—how do you feel about somebody coming in here, you know? Who do you like 
coming in here? What do you want us to do when we’re here? You know, because sometimes I feel like these 
missing links when you’re in someone’s home. You know, like—I don’t know, just to provide better care I 
guess. Just because like I said when I get a care plan it might not be complete, so if you get the client more 
involved in the care, I think that it would be better. 
I: 
Well, that’s an interesting perspective because we’re here because we think you don’t have enough of 
a voice, and we want to hear your voice, and you’re saying, the clients don’t have enough of a voice. 
P: 
I feel like sometimes they don’t, you know, unless they’re in their own little community, and they’re able 
to express themselves, you know, for someone to listen to them. So, I kinda feel like they need an opportunity. 
I: 
What do you think they would say? 
P: 
I think that they would wanna say that they wanna be seen and they wanna be heard because just in 
different situations where I’ve been, you know, they form their own committees, and their own groups so that 
they can have their voices heard where they live. You know, say if they’re living in an apartment building where 
it’s all disabled folks—what their needs are, you know. Maybe the bathroom’s not handicap accessible, or they 
need this, or they need that. 
I: 
K, do you have anything? 
I2: 
Thank you.  
I: 
Yeah. I think unless you have any final thoughts, final words, and as I said earlier we can, if we want to 
have another chance to clarify certain things or add to what you’ve already said, that would be great. 
Otherwise, I want to thank you as well for the work that you do, and for being willing to tell us your story. So, 
we want to help you get the word out, and share it with others. 
P: 
I really do think it’s important. There’s a lot of folks that like you said, that are gonna need help or that 
need help. I mean they’re constantly turning people away. They’re on waiting lists. I mean it’s pretty bad. 
I: 
We need to do something about it. I hope through these interviews we can make a difference, so thank 
you so much. 
P: 
Thank you. 
I: 
For agreeing to do this. 
I2: 
Thank you very much. 
P: 
Thank you. 
I: 
That was great. Thanks so much. 
P: 
I hope my facial expressions aren’t all [group laughter – inaudible] over the place, like whoa. 
I: 
I kept wishing, oh, I wish we could capture that face, but then I realized, oh, we are! [group laughter] 
We are capturing that face. ‘Cause you made some great faces there [laughing]. We’ll have to figure out how 
to describe them.

I2: 
Thank you. So many thoughts. You know, one common theme that we keep coming across is that 
they’re a unique kinda person that is a PCA, and my heart can barely handle it [laughs]. 
I: 
Can you explain what you mean? I would like to hear what you mean by unique person, and by your 
heart can hardly handle it? 
I2: 
You know, I work closely with a lotta nurses at MSU, and if you’re working with like a bunch of research 
nurses [5.57], and there are giver-type of personalities, but nurses are—in like our society, our nurses are like 
touted. Nurses are—when you say you’re a nurse it means something, but I think that we need to establish that 
for PCAs because the kind of work you’re doing is kind of like hour by hour care you’re doing is incredible. And 
we were having a conversation with another PCA earlier, and she was talking about—she was really obviously 
breaking some rules, but because she just cared beyond how much she was getting paid, and beyond her 
safety, and beyond [laughing] all of this stuff, and every time we probe someone with that kind of scenario they 
said yes. So, it takes a kind of giving, open, selfless personality, and I say the heart comment because it just 
like, you know, it warms my heart to meet people like you. 
P: 
Oh, thank you. 
I2: 
Oh, it’s crazy. But thanks a lot. Also, like in my culture I didn’t know about like nursing homes or PCAs 
‘til I came to the US, because in my culture it’s just like understood that every house you go to—you go to a 
friend’s house and their grandparents are there always. We moved to the US to be closer to my maternal 
grandparents. You know, we moved countries and gave up like a lotta things, so I mean amongst other things, 
but like, yeah, that was like a big motivator. So, yeah, I can relate to your tribe. That’s crazy. 
I: 
He just got back from a trip with his grandmother who’s how old? 
I2: 
Eighty-five. 
I: 
Eighty-five, traveling the world by herself, and he went to London with her. 
P: 
Oh, wow. 
I2: 
Yeah. She’s just visiting all her kids, and nephews, and [group laughter]. 
P: 
I love that because you’re still able to get out and do all these things. I think the only other thing that I 
would probably say is, like, sometimes you’re doing Hospice care, and that is different than when someone’s 
just passing maybe without palliative or Hospice care in their— 
I: 
I still have one of these going, so if you wanna share. 
I2: 
May I grab [inaudible]. 
I: 
Yes. How is it different? 
P: 
I think that just the way the situation is set up, you know, when you take someone into a Hospice 
House, it seems like they’re accepting things more, and the family is on board with it a little bit more ‘cause 
they’ve helped make that decision for someone. 
I: 
Sure. 
P: 
You know, I’ve had a Hospice patient at home, and her daughter was in the same building, and she 
refused to come up there ‘cause she couldn’t handle it. And so, you know, you’re watching someone as they’re 
passing, but when I went I educated myself on some of these actual things you should know when you’re 
dealing with a Hospice person. Like, it has to be very quiet. The way your voice is, like, they get cold in certain 
spots, so you have to, like, cover them a certain way. There’s all these different things that are involved with

Hospice care, and one of the last things is since people can hear you is sometimes they need to know they can 
let go, and so, you know, for you to reaffirm that, and say, you know, it’s okay to let go. They’ll let go ‘cause 
they’re holding on for something. 
I: 
What an important moment in a person’s life to be present at and to help them through that. What a gift. 
P: 
Yeah, and I didn’t necessarily feel like as emotional during that time ‘cause that person needed you to 
be a certain way. You know what I mean? It had nothing to do about your emotions. It was allowing that person 
to be at peace. 
I: 
But you still have those emotions. 
P: 
Oh, sure. 
I: 
Yeah. So, what do you do with those emotions? Like what do you when you leave the room? 
P: 
You save it for when you leave. 
I: 
And then what happens? 
P: 
You might just be like a little sigh of relief like, okay. That was okay. Things are okay. And like I said, it’s 
about that person. 
I: 
You know, I’m struck by you said unique people do this kinda work. I’ve talked with a number of PCAs 
over the years. One of the social changes or ways in which we’re trying to make this better for PCAs—more 
appealing is to offer these career ladders where it’s a foot in the door, but then you might want to become an 
LPN, and then and RN and stuff, but I’ve had a number of PCAs over the years say, “I don’t wanna me a 
nurse. I don’t wanna be an LPN. I don’t wanna push pills and fill out paperwork. I wanna be a PCA.” 
P: 
Yeah. 
I: 
“Because that’s the person that’s gonna be working directly with the clients, and that’s what’s important 
to me is to have that relationship.” 
P: 
That is. 
I: 
Yeah. So, and there’s the people that go on to be nurses, you know, they might appreciate that 
relationship, too, but there’s also something else driving them, whereas for you it’s that relationship—direct 
care. 
P: 
Yes. I like the direct care. 
I: 
Yeah. Okay.
