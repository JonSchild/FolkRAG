HE—Now, Mary Ann, there's something wrong goixt on 
here every night, 
And if you'll only listen I'll convince you I 
am right. 
I 
hear the noise so very plain out at the garden gate. 
There is some one -knocking every night about the 
hour of eight. 
CHORUS. 
HE—Now there it goes again. 
SHE—Shure I 
hear it very plain. 
Burit—There's some one comes here evmy night a-knocking 
at the gate. 
SnE—Och, Michael dear, don't be a 
fool—that's Kittie dar-
ling's beau, 
The finest young man in the town, that very well you 
know. 
He's afraid of you, and won't come in until you're 
gone to bed— 
It's Denny McNamara, sure, the oldest son of Ted. 
CHORUS. 
HE— Is it little Denny McNamara, Teddy's oldest boy, 
That wants to be my son-in-law? Och, Mary Ann, 
what joy ! 
I've had my eye upon him, and I've watched him here

DENNY AND KITTIE, 
As sung by the M URRAYS in their original sketch entitled " Old and Voting." 
Permission for re,resentation must be obtained from the Murrays only. 
SUE—Oh, how glad I 
din to think that my old daddy 
has consented for to let my Denny visit me. 
Sure the thoughts of it alone does make me feel so happy, 
And what an agreeable surprise to Denny it will be. 
CHORUS. 
For he needn't. come .1-knocking at the garden gate no more, 
Or when he hears a 
noise he needn't hide behind the door ; 
I 
needn't steal him in the kitchen, as oft I've done before, 
To see his Kittie dear. 
IIE—I think I 
must be crazy, or the old man has been drink-
ing— 
He took me by the hand, and said you could be my 
wife. 
Now, darling, if that's true, and you'll only be consenting, 
'Twill make me one of the happiest boys you've seen 
in all your life.

Pray listen awhile to my song— 
I 
promise to not keep you long; 
I'm from Erin, you all plainly see, 
just come to this land of the free. 
When I 
think of the friends that I 
left in old Ireland, 
They'll have brighter days soon, so they tell— 
But, dear friends, while I 
wait, just please understand 
That I've apples and peanuts to sell. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, apples here, apples here ! is my cry, 
Nice sweet apples here, now some one buy; 
You hear me all day long, night time as well, 
For I've apples and peanuts to sell. 
There's many things here I 
don't like— 
They'll hang a 
man now just for spite ; 
All the women are wanting to vote, 
And for offices hundreds have wrote. 
I 
think they'll succeed when Grant stops a- smoking, 
Or when Tweed from rascality's fell. 
I 
think the whole gang deserve a 
good choking, 
But I've apples and peanuts to sell. 
Oh, apples here, &c. 
But, dear friends, I 
must bid you good-by, 
I've a 
hundred, and gold is up high. 
It's married I 
soon -nope to be 
To a 
lad that's now crossing the sea. 
Oh, how happy I'll be along with my Barney, 
In our little cot down in the dell— 
I'll bother my dear friends no more with my blarney 
Of apples and peanuts to sell. 
Oh, apples here, &c.

MY DREAM OF LOVE IS O'ER. 
THE GEM THAT DECKS THE SEA. 
Words and Music by M . 
TITHBLERONICON O'REsanori, and 
Sung successfully by DELEHANTY & CUMMINGS. 
Oh! we've parted from each other, 
And our dream of love is o'er. 
That bright dream was too beautiful to last. 
And we'll meet as only strangers, 
In the future, evermore. 
Our once tender love is buried in the past. 
Tho' I've tried to bear the blow, 
Without sighs or bitter tears, 
And tried to smile when my heart ached with pain. 
Yet the burning tears would fall 
In spite of all that I 
could do. 
For the darling one I 
ne'er shall see again. 
CHORUS. 
My dream of love is o'er, 
I 
try to smile when my heart aches with pain, 
But the memory of the past comes up before 
Me, like a 
dream, for the darling one I 
ne'er shall 
see again. 
Oh ! they say you love another, 
Who has claimed you for his bride, 
And you wish me to forgive and to forget, 
All the vows we pledged together 
By the rippling of the tide, 
As I 
looked into your beauteous eyes—my Pet. 
Ah! the heart is like the tides 
That flow and ebb at will; 
I 
would not cease to love thee if I 
could. 
So, thro' all the future years, 
I'll love the fondly, dearly, darling ! 
For I 
could not cease to love thee if I 
would. 
My dream of love is o'er, Sc. 
Written by HARRY BENNETT for THE M URRAYS. 
Old Ireland's sons and daughters fair, 
They long to see her free; 
They love that little isle so green, 
That nestles on the sea. 
Adversity has been your fate, 
Your sons have had to emigrate, 
The day will come, if we but wait, 
When Ireland will be free. 
CHORUS. 
Erin, Erin, the gem that decks the sea, 
Erin, Erin, the home of mirth and glee. 
Your brave sons, with stout hearts will fight for liberty; 
Erin, Erin, we'll die to make you free. 
Prosperity and happiness, 
For Erin are in store, 
And all her sons, so brave and true, 
Will hasten to her shore. 
The turf fires they will brightly burn, 
The good old times they will return, 
Hibercia's sons no more will yearn 
When'Ireland she is free. 
Erin, Erin, the gem, &c. 
THE BROOKLYN FIRE. 
Written by T HE M URRAVS, E D. and ALICE, and sung by GEO. MURRAY. 
OhI sad and dismal is the tale 
I 
will relate to you : 
'Tis of the Brooklyn Fire, and 
The souls that perished, too. 
You all have heard their awful fate, 
The old, the young, and gay ; 
That ill-starred band, by Heaven's command, 
Are dead and passed away. 
They left their homes so gay and free, 
With joy on every lip, 
And in their blithest moment, ah, 
There came that fatal slip. 
The demon fire raged around, 
Not one to check its sway ; 
All fear and strife once full of life, 
Are dead and passed away. 
But blame to none, it was I 
Leaven's shaft 
That struck that happy throng ; 
The king of terrors wakened where 
He slept so deep and long. 
The poor souls in the gallery, who 
Enjoyed that fatal play, 
They little thought their lives were sought— 
They are dead and passed away. 
There are some of those departed ones 
Are well known to you all : 
I 
tarry Murdock and his partner 
Met death within those halls, 
In years to come we'll not forget, 
Though feeble, old, and gray, 
Their souls bereft they would have left, 
They are dead and passed away.

BLUE GLASS, 
Serio Comic Song. 
Muse Published by E. H. HARDING, 229 Bowery, N. Y. 
Price 10 cents. 
Written and sung-by JIM CAMPBELL. 
Music by Rov LESLIE. 
0, this is the age of invention, 
Strange wonders turn up ev'ry.day, 
All the sciences seem in convention, 
Where they'll stop at, no mortal can say; 
But the latest and greatest of mysteries, 
Which all other wonders surpass, 
To go down in posterities' hist'ries, 
Are these wonderful panes of blue glass. 
CHORUS. 
'Tis a 
science .none others compare to, 
The philosopher's stone found at last, 
For ' twill cure all the ills flesh is heir to, 
These wonderful panes of blue glass. 
If a 
pane of blue glass you put over 
The head of your mother-in-law, 
She'll be tame as a 
lamb in spring clover, 
And she can't even wag her own jaw; 
Your own wife won't dare ask where you've been to, 
If a 
night at your club you should pass, 
If you have in your own bed-room windows, 
These wonderful panes of blue glass. 
'Tis a 
science, etc. 
,Twould do well in the windows of churches, 
It might keep the preachers from sin. 
And in street cars 'would make the conthietors, 
Account for each fare they take in; 
19 
Awl if you had a 
brick in your hat, sir, 
For a 
sober man wanted to pass, 
'Twould be easy for you to do that, sir, 
In your hat put a 
pane of blue glass. 
'Tis a 
science, etc. 
A 
blue goblet full of good whiskey, 
Would be most too tempting to pass, 
And no temperance man will get frisky, 
If he drinks his rum from a 
blue glass; 
All the boarding-house keepers will have them, 
And the boarders will get fat quite fast, 
They can't tell the shirt buttons from grizzle, 
When the hash is served up in blue glass. 
'Tis a 
science, etc. 
If we send up a 
dozen of glaziers, 
To the Capitol with this blue glass, 
Congressmen would be honest as blazes, 
And the days of their stealing be past; 
If we had blue glass ballot boxes, 
We'd have fair elections at last, 
And a 
President upright and honest, 
If the White House was glazed with blue glass. 
'Tis a 
science, etc.

OLD RECOLLECTIONS. 
Words and Music by LARRY BENNETT. 
FAR back in the sweet past my mem'ry's oft wandered, 
To the spot that I 
loved neath the old shady trees; 
Where oft with my books o'er quaint stories I've pondered, 
Or to dream-land was wafted by mid- summer's breeze. 
I 
recall with a 
sigh the bright days of my childhood, 
When ' neath the old trees with my comrades I 
strayed, 
And heard the birds singing sweet songs in the wild- wood, 
Or watched the bright brook as it flowed throng .; 
the glade 
CHORUS. 
But, ah! the bright days of my boyhood are fleeting, 
The faces of dear ones are passing away; 
It makes my heart sad when I 
think of our meeting 
'Neath the old shady trees, every bright summer day. 
Long years have gone by, and my comrades have left me, 
Their voices no longer are heard in the glade: 
But I 
see the old trees that I 
loved in my childhood, 
With their wide-spreading branches, and welcoming shade, 
As I 
pause by the brooklet, old menfry's steal o'er me, 
My heart it grows sad—the hot tears will not stay; 
For the many dear friends that I 
loved in my boy-hood, 
Are gone from my sight, and are passing away. 
Chorus.— But, !, & c.

lean banana, decayed to the core, 
E'er since I 
slipped on thy peel I've been so sore. 
On my back I 
lingered just where I 
fell; 
The sweet words I 
uttered would ne'er do to tell. 
If I 
could have caught then the dizzy looking gawk, 
Who threw that banana peel out on the walk. 
It made me see stars that I 
ne'er saw before, 
A 
lean banana I'll love thee no more. 
1St CHORUS. 
Lightly I'll tread on the sidewalk evermore, 
A 
lean banana rotten to the core; 
I 
slipped on thy peel, I'll be careful evermore, 
A 
lean banana from some foreign shore.. 
A 
lean banana, you've caused many a 
roar, 
I 
slipped on thy peel and you turned me o'er and o'er• 
And young girls have blushed so when thrown off their pegs 
Slipping on a 
banana and showing their dear legs. 
Numerous are the pedestrians that you have caused to fall. 
Great big and little, lean, lank and tall. 
The seats of fat men's pants you've busted and you've tore. 
A 
lean banana, how they have swore. 
2d CHORUS. 
Watchful I 
am from the time I 
leave my door, 
A 
lean banana, I've heard of you before. 
E'er since I 
slipped on thy peel I've been so soro, 
A 
lean banana from some Dutch grocery store.

I 
would ask of you, my darling, 
A 
question, soft and low, 
That gives me many a 
heart-ache, 
As the moments come and go. 
Your love I 
know is truthful, 
But the truest love grows cold 
It is this that I 
would ask you,— 
Will you love me when I'm old? 
It is this that I 
would ask you,--
Will you love me when I'm old.

And its ev'nings bells 1.),) 
Life's morn will soon be waning, 
And its ev'nings bells be toll'd; 
But my heart will know no sadness 
If you'll love me when I'm old. 
But my heart will know no sadness, 
If you'll love me when I'm 
? 
Down the stream of time together, 
We are sailing side by side; 
Hoping some bright day to anchor, 
;..ale beyond the surging tide, 
To-day our sky is cloudless, 
But the night may cloitds unfold; 
And its storms may gather round us,— 
Will you love me when I'm old? 
And its storms may gather round us,— 
Will you love we when I'm old? 
Life's morn, & c. 
When my hair shall shame the snow-drift, 
And mine eyes shall dimmer grow; 
I 
would lean upon some loved one, 
In the valley as I 
go. 
I 
would claim of you a 
promise, 
Worth to me a 
world of gold; 
It is only this, my darling,— 
That you'll love me when I'm old? 
It is only this, my darling,— 
That you'll love me when I'm old? 
Life's morn, tca.

SONG AND CHORUS. 
My Susan has the sweetest face, 
In all Manhattan 'Isle; 
The whitest hand, the smallest waist, 
The most bewitching smile; 
And when by her bright lips I 
swore 
Her love would crown my bliss, 
I 
thought I 
was in duty bound, 
The rosy book to kiss. 
CHORUS. 
Don't now! Don't now, modest Susan cried, 
As bashfully she turned from me. 
Her blushing cheeks to hide. 
Don't now ! don't now ! darling, if you please! 
Well, have your way, though I 
must say. 
You are an awful tease. 
I 
gazed on her retreating form, 
With rapture most intense, 
And as she waved adieu to me, 
I 
thought she looked immense; 
The naughty pull-hack dress, 
That to her charming figure clings, 
Revealed her little fairy feet, 
As light as fancy's wings. 
Don't now! Don't now, etc. 
My heart was leaping witI 
No thought of care or pa,.., 
I 
dreamt of Susan all the night. 
And sighed to dream again, 
'11 
When by the squalling cats #plisturbed, 
1# • 
That round the roof did stroll, 
As Susan's modest chidings fell, 
Like music on my soul. 
Don't mrtv! Don't now, etc. 
So all went like a 
marriage bell, 
Upon a 
summer's day, 
Till I 
discovered she was false, 
Or had been led astray. 
I 
saw her standing with a 
swell, 
Whose arm was around my dear; 
And, as I 
passed, her silv'ry voice 
Stole softly on my ear. 
Don't nuw! Don't now, etc. 
sad to find your friends are false, 
Your pockets void of cash; 
To find remains of toothless combs 
And hoot-heels in your hash; 
But 0, what grief was mine to hear 
My cruel rival say, 
Another kiss, you're all my own, 
Since you have named the day. 
Don't now! Don't now, etc.

When I'm laid away in my grave, 
When my spirit has gone to heaven above, 
To hint who my soul will save.

There's one little wish I 
ask of you, 
See that my grave's kept green.

When on earth no more

One sweet little wish, darling, grant me.

Will you keep me, love in remembrance, 
When the voice of chiding is heard, 
When other's may- speak in censure or blame, 
Speak not one unkindly word.

I'm as happy as the day is long, 
My mind is never easy, 
No matter whether right or wrong, 
You must not think me rude. 
For love it is the burden of my song, 
With joy I'm almost crazy; 
And if perchance I 
sing or dance, 
You must not think me rude, 
And if I 
make one little break, 
I

don't intrude.

I 
was walking by her door, 
When I 
heard the music sweet, 
And my heart with joy filled over, 
I 
couldn't keep my feet. 
So keep the music ringing, 
For it makes me feel so good; 
And if, perchance, I 
sing or dance, 
You must not think me rude. 
And if I 
make one little break, 
I 
hope I 
don't intrude.

At a 
fancy ball the other night, 
Myself and little Daisy, 
We kept it up till broad daylight, 
We 
felt so awful good. 
011, Daisy looked so fair and bright, 
She set the men all crazy; 
And if they asked her for to dance, 
She'd ask me it she could, 
And then I'd say in a 
careless way— 
I

don't intrude. 
Oh, dear, etc.

DORKINS' NIGHT, 
Written by Bonny NEwcomii. and sung with great success by 
AA-m.1Am ticINLAN, at the Olympic Theatre, Broadway. N. Y. 
Music. published by JOHN PERRY. Washington St., opposite Boston 
Theatre. Boston, Mass. 
The theatre was full— it was Dorking' night— 
That is, Dorkins was going to appear 
At night, in a 
favorite comedy part, 
For he was comedian here. 
Funny ! why, he'd make you laugh, till the tears 
Ran down your face like rain: 
And every time he Ca1110 on the stage. 
You'd try to stop laughing, in vain. 
A family? yes, he'd a 
family. 
And he lov'd them as dear as his life: 
And you'd scarcely find a 
happier lot 
Than Dorkins' children and wife. 
And you'd scarcely find a 
happier lot 
Than Dorkins children and wife. 
There came one night. and I 
was in front, 
And Perkins was going to play 
A character new to himself and the stage. 
Which he'd trod for many a 
day. 
By eight the theatre was perfectly jammed. 
All awaited a 
pleasant surprise; 
For they knew they'd laugh ' till their sides would ache 
And they long'd for the curtain to rise. 
The play soon began—each neck was stretched forth, 
And eagerly watched each eye, 
For Dorkins to make his first entrance. and then 
To give him a 
cheerful hi! hi! 
For Dorkins to make his first entrance and then 
To give him a 
cheerful hi! hi ! 
At last he appeared, amid loud applause, 
But something was wrong you could see; 
" 
Why, Dorkins is playing quite badly to-night!" 
The people said, sitting 'round me. 
A 
hiss ! yes, it was; I 
saw Dorkins start 
As if 6tung by a 
serpent's fang; 
And he'd cast a 
beseeching look all 'round, 
While his head on his breast he would hang. 
" 
He's drunk!" some one said, and I 
thought so myself. 
For, to me, it was awful at times, 
To see how he'd struggle along with his part, 
And continually stick in his lines, 
To see how he'd struggle along with his part, 
And continually stick in his lines. 
The footlights, at last, he approached very slow, 
And, " Ladies and g,entlennen," said— 
"If I 
cannot please you to- night, 
The fault's not the heart, but the head. 
There's many a 
night I've made you all laugh, 
When so ill 1 
could scarcely well stand; 
And every effort was pain to me then— 
Yes, if even I'd raise but my hand. 
You hiss me to- night, and say that I'm drunk," 
From his heart came a 
sob and a 
moan; 
"I'll tell you the reason—I 
know you won't laugh— 
I've a 
little one dying at home! 
tell you the reason—I 
know you won't laugh— 
I've a 
little one dying at home I"

Price 10 cents. 
Someone's watching at the window, 
Where the people hurry by. 
Listening for a 
well-known-footstep, 
With a 
bright and eager eye. 
For they cherish still a 
promise 
Of a 
heart they know is true, 
Who has whispered, love, to-morrow, 
I 
will come again to you. 
CHORUS. 
Someone's watching at the window, 
With their face.against the pane; 
Someone's softly, sweetly saying, 
"Will he, \yin he come again ?" 
Someone's growing very weary. 
As the moments come and go; 
Where the wayward one is wandering 
They would dearly like to know. 
Surely he can never linger 
From my side so long and late, 
When he knows the sweetest welcome, 
Here, his coming cloth await. 
Someone's:watching„ etc. 
Someone's dreaming of the story. 
Ever new and ever old, 
That they long to hear repeated, 
Though it often has been told, 
They are from the past recalling. 
All their many dreams of bliss, 
Hearing not the footsteps falling, 
'Till they are startled with a 
kiss. 
Someone's watching, etc. 
YOUR POCKET-BOOK IS YOUR BEST 
FRIEND.

Words by ARTHUR W . 
FRENCH. 
Music by A. CULL. 
There are friends you deem true, they will linger near you, 
In the flush of prosperity's hours, 
But in poverty's day, they will vanish away, 
Like the fading of summer's sweet flowers. 
As you journey along in life's turbulent throng, 
While the hill sides you climb or descend, 
You will see it some day. I 
am right when I 
say 
That your pocketbook is your best friend; 
That your pocketbook is your best friend. 
CHORUS. 
"Es a 
friend that you need, and a 
true friend indeed, 
Ever ready to give or to lend; 
For wherever you go, you will find it is so, 
That your pocketbook is your best friend; 
That your pocketbook is your best friend. 
Our political life is nothing but strife. 
Where all honor is swallowed in gain; 
But to hint such a 
thing to a 
man of the ring, 
Why of course they would call you insane. 
Many a 
man is in power at this very same hour 
That our honest votes never would send: 
and the way it is done is quite plain to each one, 
,Why their pocketbook was their best friend. 
'Tis a 
friend, etc. 
There's a 
gay young cashier, with a 
thousand a 
year, 
And his horses and ladies and wine. 
Oh, he goes at a 
rate quite alarming to state, 
Though he draws on a 
very big mine. 
They discover, some day, he has gambled away 
Many thousands or more, and the end 
Is. they give him a

Now I

Come again some other night. 
In the moonlight, when we part, 
Oft I 
hold her to my heart, 
Breathing words of fondest love. 
'Neath the shining stars above. 
Roses sleeping, never hear 
What I 
whisper in her ear; 
Sweetly smiling, she does say, 
As I 
leave her side to stray, 
one again, etc. 
There's a 
nest among the flowers, 
Where, in other happy hours, 
We will ever fondly dwell, 
'Mid the bliss of wedlock's spell; 
Not a

Shall I 
find to grieve me there; 
In these hours of life's sweet May, 
There will be no need to say,

Don't think by my dress that I've come here to beg,

Ah I

But now when they meet me they look the other way, 
My company now they decline.

In the county Tipperary there lived, long ago, 
A 
Widow whose husband was dead, 
And whose son, I 
am told, when scarce a 
year old, 
Sang songs and drank whiskey in bed. 
And as he grew big he could dance ye a 
jig, 
On a 
table, a 
chair, or a 
spoon; 
And the ladies would sigh for a 
glance of his eye, 
Or a 
kind word from Terrence Muldoon.

Be could read, he could write— 
He could dance, he could fight; 
He could sing or could whistle a 
tune, 
And the ladies would sigh, for a 
glance of his eye. 
Or a 
kind word from Terrence Muldoon. 
Young Terrence was purty as purty could be, 
And his features—so every one said— 
Was gentle and mild as a 
two year old child, 
While his hair was a 
beautiful red; 
And as for his hand, by my soul it was grand, 
And his nose it turned up to the Moon; 
Sure, the boys in the street, all envied th ,- feet, 
Of the beautiful Terrence Muldoon. 
He could read Ae. 
Young Terrence's eyes were as blue as the skies, 
And his voice was as sweet as a 
fife; 
But his passion to stale often sent him to jail, 
And at last put an end to his life. 
For one night in his sleep he was caught stealing sheep, 
And the jury agreed very soon— 
A 
rope, do you see, 'round the limb of' a 
tree, 
Soon ended poor Terrence Muldoon.

not be--
For it's better to die ior Erin's rights than to live in slavery. 
When I 
received my sentence, ' twas on a

Where hundreds of my comrades assembled all around ; 
My liberty was offered me if their I

THE CHIP GIRL 
sung with immense success by Amen Ross Munnt,., 
No father—no mother have I ; 
No friends in this world I 
claim ; 
No refuge to which I 
can fly, 
Should sickness o‘ertake my weak frame ; 
harefooted, wretched in plight, 
I 
come with my wood cut in strips, 
And call out, morn, noon and night— 
Want chips ? Want chips? do you want any 
Chips—chips—do you want any chips? 
Through windows, as I 
pass along, 
Gay rooms and glad facos appear; 
While mingling with music and song, 
The laugh of the happy I 
hear. 
With pleasure, their path scattered o'er ; 
They heed not the rain as it drips 
On the poor little girl at their door, 
Who calls—do you want any chips? 
Some nook in the Winter I 
find, 
Where heat from a 
furnace is shed; 
When calm blows the sweet Summer wind, 
I 
care not what place mates my bed. 
Then pity the poor little girl, 
With pale face and feverish lips. 
Who comes with her wood basket filled, 
And calls—do you want any chips ?

Once more I 
am back to my childhood's bright home, 
That I

Oh! little I

thus would roam, 
Back here in my rags, filled with woe ;

From my journey across the wild moor; 
I 
am cold and hungry, unable to call, 
And afraid to knock at the door.

I'm afraid to knock at the door— 
To meet Father and Mother,

will knock at the door, 
And if asked to come in, 
I'll take courage and try to be bold ; 
I 
never could stand this piercing wind, 
I'd perish out here in the cold ; 
I 
dread to meet them, though I 
know they'll be glad 
To welcome the wanderer home ; 
I

For I've made them feel sad, 
But never again will I

crets of liandkerchiei, 
Glove, and Parasol Flirtations ; the eorsas..t is_terpretation of all Signals,

rare amusement for young ladies and gentlemen. Read what two 
leading New York papers say of it: 
The N. Y. Evening AlaU writes: ( 
"A Little Book has lately appeared in print at Mr. A. 
J. 
FISHER'S, 98 Nas-
sau street ca ;led the • Little Flirt." We cannot say that we recommend 
it to our young lady and gentlemen readers, as we think it would only 
encourage the bad habit of " flirting." 
Unfortunately, there is enough 
of it done without any further necessity of explaining " how, when and 
'where to do it," and this little volume would advise and initiate the un-
corrupted in practicing what is commonly called "flirting." 
The N. sr. Eeening Telegram writes; " We have lately seen a 
neat lift!, 
book, bound in Morocco leather, costing twenty-five cents, called the 
"Little Flirt," published by A. J. FISHER, No. 9S Nassau street. 
It 
gives information of the modus opt randi of flirting, and of the meaning 
of every motion of the handkerchief, fan, glove and parasol. 
As there 
is nothing at all objectionable in the volume, and its contents might af-
ford sonic innocent amusement to many, we do not hesitate to recom-
mend it to our young lady and gentlemen readers."

tine-Telling Cards.—This is the old-

pnblished it for years, and the demand is continually increasing. 
These Cards are arr.nged and printed in series—Hearts, Clubs, Dia-
monds and Spades—and each or these into K for King. Q 
for Queen, 
and K 
for Knave, and numbers 1, 3, to 10. 
The Cards are arranged in 
four rows, and are to be read according to directions. Many of the an-
swers depend upon the position certain cards bear to other cards. The 
method of playing is somewhat complicated, but the directions have 
been ieade so that very little study will suffice to an ordinary under-
standing. Many professional Fortune- Tellers use these cards, and we 
are in receipt of letters in relation to them from all parts of the U. S.

Cards.—This Series of Cards has been arranged'. 
to meet a 
want Lequeutly felt by young people—a 
want of means of 
expressing one's sentiments in such a way as to be non-committaL 
Many young ladies are visited by gentlemen who are either too diffi. 
dent or too fearful of a 
repulse, to venture upon asking the momentous 
question. The lady is restrained, by custom and a 
sense of propriety, 
from dung anything that would seem to be an unlady-like encourage-
ment. 
As a 
result of this dilemma, many lives are spent as an unloved 
tedious existence, which might have been prolonged and enjoyed in the 
happiness of matrimony. This pack of CArds will overcome the diffi-
culty, and beiiig in the shape of questions and answers, will cover every 
phase of courtship. 'The sentiments conveyed therein need not be 
adopted by the parties to the game as their own, unless it accords with 
the state of their affectiom., which fact makes further explanation un-
taecessary. 
The playing of these Cards is not restricted to two players, 
but may be enjoyed by evening pa rties
