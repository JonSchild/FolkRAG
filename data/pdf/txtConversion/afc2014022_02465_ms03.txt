Interviewee: Adam Hausmann 
Interviewer: Andy Kolovos 
Interview Date: April 15, 2015 
Interview Location: Adam’s Berry Farm 
 
After my morning with Carl Cushing I changed gears quite a bit and headed over to 
meet with Adam Hausmann of Adam’s Berry Farm in Charlotte, VT.  The interview 
with Hausmann emerges from the thread of interviews exploring farming in the 
Intervale. In addition my interest in interviewing Adam also came from a desire to 
contrast Greg’s interview with Clark Wilson, whose large scale, conventional 
operation forms an interesting counterpoint to Hausmann’s. 
 
I first encountered Adam’s Berry Farm several years back in the Intervale while my 
kids were at Trinity Childrens’ Center near by and we would bring them down there 
after pre-school to pick berries.  It was a great place—convenient and friendly. Plus 
since he was organic I wasn’t as freaked out about the kids picking and eating 
berries.  Adam moved out of the Intervale after Irene, but as he notes in the 
interview leaving was something he had long considered because of the 
unpredictability of flooding in the location. 
 
Adam is came to farming from a non-farming background, and since he deals in 
seasonal soft fruits,  it was a pretty good contrast to my morning at the slaughter 
and processing facility in Ferrisburgh. Adam took a lot of time talk and had a great 
deal on his mind ranging from his personal trajectory to berry growing to the 
generalities of organic farming. 
 
Adam too is a great talker and generous with his time. I think he would also make an 
interesting addition to a panel on agriculture in the state. He even offered to host a 
VFC event at the farm at some point in the future.
