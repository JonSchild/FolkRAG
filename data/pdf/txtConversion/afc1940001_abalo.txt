Abalone1. In Carmel Bay the people say,We feed the LazzaroniOn caramels[,?] and cockle-shellsAnd
hunks of abalone.2. O, some folks boast of quail on toast,Because they think it's tony;But my tom-
cat gets nice and fatOn hunks of abalone.3. He hides in caves, beneath the waves,His ancient
patrimony:Race suicide will ne'er betideThe fertile abalone.4. I telegraph my better halfBy Morse
or by MarconiBut when in need of greater speedI send an abalone. 5. Some folks say that pain is
realAnd some say that it's phoney;But as for me, when I can't agree,I eat an abalone.6. Our naval
hero, best of all,His name was Pauley Joney;He sailed the seas as he darn pleased.But he never ate
abalone.
