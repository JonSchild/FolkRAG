I've a (laughter, her name is Rose, 
She dances the Can Can upon her nose; 
She wears brass diamonds and makes clothes, 
And waltzes with the clown; 
I 
ler name on the bills is Madame McGuire, 
For ten million a 
night she walks the slack- wire; 
Drinks Cod-Liver- Oil and spits red fire, 
With P. T. Barnum's show. 
CHORUS: 
My daughter Mary Ellen goes on the trapeze, 
Walks on the tight- rope from trees to trees; 
She is a 
terrible masher and takes her ease, 
My daughter Mary Ellen McGuire. 
She'll put on the gloves with tigers to fight, 
She'll work no less than ten million a 
night; 
She shoots from a 
cannon higher than a 
kite, 
She wrestles all the bears; 
She'll soon buy a 
mansion of solid gold, 
Next July she'll be nineteen years old • 
Then she'll be more cheeky and bold, 
Than her Nobbs, the queen of Ireland.

Written by JAAE2s Mei:Imo:4m, for and sung by PAT RatiLT 
with great success. 
Air—What Do You Say. 
I 
am Senator McCann and ex-Alderman, 
I've refused the President's chair; 
I 
eat Webster's Dictionary for pills, 
I've made a 
fortune bottling air; 
If I 
was President, I'd have the Mississippi River 
run dry, 
I'd make girls wear mustaches and pants; 
We'd have moonlight picnics in the clouds, 
And dance an Irish Can Can dance. 
CHORUS: 
I'd make all the Chinese do washing free, 
Hang the organ grinders for fun; 
Oh, I'll build an iron ladder to Heaven, 
When the Brooklyn Bridge is done. 
Dance. 
I'd put all the old maids upon the Police, 
In the Gas House I'd put Jim Blaine; 
I'd have a 
tunnel under the Atlantic Ocean, 
And have a 
law to prevent snow and rain; 
I'd paint the moon, kalsomine the clouds, 
Whitewash the stars and sun; 
You can live forever, have your breath insured, 
W4en the Brooklyn Bridge is done.

Chase Yourself up the Alley. 
Written by ,LtmEs RAcirmoNn. 
Greatest success of PAT REILLY 
Jeremiah McCarthy is the IlaMC I 
bear, 
I 
work hard laying stones and bricks; 
But the loafers say I 
am too light to sink, 
And I 
am the king of full blooded micks; 
They nailed my Sunday clothes and hat to the wall 
Stabbed my wife with an eight day ,-
tin; 
Threw me down the sewer, danced on niv lungs, 
And called me an Irish bum. 
CHORUS: 
But worse than that, they killed my eldest son, 
Those dirty loafers and bums; 
They holler McNally, chase yourself up the alley, 
And shave the whiskers off your gums. 
They stole the shoes right off my feet, 
Dropped a 
cannon ball on my head; 
Took me up on the roof and threw me oil, 
Eleven gallon of blood I 
bled; 
They hired an undertaker to bury me alive, 
lie discovered I 
was in a 
trance; 
There was a 
hundred blackguards with a 
German 
Band, 
On my coffin to have a 
dance. 
CHORUS: 
I 
had them sent to jail for seventeen years, 
They nearly seared the old woman to death; 
Then set me on a 
cake of ice, 
..Nnd asked me for to sweat.

THE BROKEN DOWN GENTLEMAN, 
'Recitation. 
Written by JAMES I-
twit:NI()NI) fur PAT REILLY, Mid recited by hiri2 
with great success. 
McNally stood on a 
barrel of flour, 
Trying to earn a 
stamp; 
Lecturing for politicians, some one 
hollered you are a 
tramp; 
You are a 
liar! says McNally, 
can prove you are a 
bum; 
Ah, cheese it Jack, don't guy him, 
The .1 
is full of rum. 
Forty years ago I 
was a 
banker, 
And lived in finest style; 
I 
had an only daughter, 
The beauty for many a 
mile; 
She fell in love with a 
blackguard, 
One Terry Ryan by name, 
Who made me make my will to them, 
On the plea I 
was insane—oh! 
Soon I 
was forsaken, 
And left in pain to groan; 
And I 
found out by the looks of things, 
I 
was left forever alone! 
They sold my home, took all my money, 
Did not leave me a 
dollar; 
I 
could not get a 
position then, 
Even being a 
first-rate scholar. 
But never mind, my time will come 
When it's my turn to light the lamp, 
But I'll wait patiently for it, 
For I 
am only a 
sample tramp. 
O'REILLY vs. McDERMOTT. 
Written by PATRICK NEESON for SAM RICKEY, and originally reeited 
by EDWARD HALEY, of 
The 2 HALEYS, 
Not one hundred yards from where I 
stand, 
In this, our glorious Union land, 
Was kept a 
first-class whisky stand 
By a 
man, and his name was O'Connor. 
A man that's known both near and far, 
Attends to Mike O'Conuor's bar, 
lie, in our late war, received no scar, 
And his name is O'Reilly. 
Beneath our starry banners wave, 
There was not a 
man fought half so brave, 
Or more greenbacks for whisky gave, 
Than -
McDermott. 
O'Connor's gin-mill blazed with light, 
On that eventful and bloody night, 
When McDermott had the fearful tight 
With O'Reilly. 
With frowning brow and flashing eye, 
O'Reilly drank a 
glass of rye, 
Which he demolished without a 
sigh; 
Then turning to McDermott, he said, 
You alcoholic vat! 
you drunken loon! 
You've DO more brains than a 
wee gossoon; 
Begorra, I'll make you change your tune, 
Says McDermott. 
With sleeves rolled up, O'Reilly stood 
And swore he'd die, before he would 
Take back a 
single word that could 
In any manner be construed 
Into an apology to McDermott. 
McDermott went for O'Reilly's nose, 
And on it planted fearful blows, 
Till on his eye a 
shanty arose, 
Erected by McDermott. 
O'Reilly fell into a 
swoon, 
And his head rested on a 
big spittoon; 
Then he dreamt of Barnem's big Balloon, 
While McDermott quietly put on his 
Coat, and went home about his business.

Grandmother's Chair. 
Written by JOHN READ, and suns with great success as the latest hit of 
the season at H ARRIGAN & H ART s 
Theatre Comique by EDWIN BARRY. 
Musk at E. H. HARDING'S, 229 Bowery, 
Copyrighted. 
My grandmother she at the age of eighty-three, 
One day in May was taken ill and died, 
And after she was dead, the will of course was read, 
By a 
lawyer as we all stood by his side, 
To my brother, it was found, she had left a 
hundred pounds 
The same unto my sister I 
do declare, 
But when it came to me, the lawyer said I 
see, 
She has left to you her " Old arm-chair." 
CHORUS. 
And how they titter'd, how they chaff'd, 
How my brother and sister laugh'd, 
When they heard the lawyer declare 
Granny had only left to me her old arm chair. 
I 
thought it hardly fair, still I 
said I 
did not care, 
And in the ev'ning took the chair away, 
The neighbors they me chaff'd, my brother at me laugh'd 
And said it would be useful John, some day. 
When you settle down in life find some girl to be your wife, 
You'll find it very handy, I 
declare. 
On a 
cold and frosty night when the fire is burning bright, 
You can then sit in your old arm chair. 
And bow they titter'd, &c. 
What my brother said came true for in a 
year or two, 
Strange to say I 
settled down in married life, 
I 
first the girl did court, and then the ring I 
bought, 
Took her to church and when she was my wife, 
The old girl and me, were as happy as could be, 
For when my work was over I 
declare, 
I 
ne'er abroad would roam but each night would stay at home 
And be seated in my old arm chair. 
And how they titter'd, & c. 
One night the chair fell down, when I 
pick'd it up I 
found 
The seat had fallen out upon the floor. 
And there to my surprise, I 
saw before my eyes. 
A 
lot of notes, two thousand pounds or more, 
When my brother heard of this, the fellow I 
confess, 
Went nearly mad with rage and tore his hair, 
But I 
only laugh'd at him, and said unto him, Jem, 
Don't you wish you had the old ann chair? 
And how they titter'd, & c. 
.a.&stak.

THE HUNGRY BOARDING HOUSE. 
Written by JAMES 3.1eAvoy for O'NEIL and CONROY, Vocalists, 
Comedians and Sketch Artists. 
In a 
Broadway house, across the street, 
Where all the hungry boarders eat, 
At noon they open wide their gash, 
To make short work of their soup and hash. 
At nine o'clock they slip out of bed, 
And fly down stairs for to be fed; 
They clean the table as slick as a 
mouse 
In the hungry, starving boarding house. 
CHORUS: 
Nobody knows what the boarders eat— 
Pass no remarks about the meat— 
Just keep mum and close your mouth 
In the hungry' starving boarding house. 
The cooks they sleep on the second floor, 
With a 
padlock hitched on every door, 
So the hungry boarders can't get in. 
Where was Moses when they douced the glim ? 
They make them sleep up in the attic, 
And all night long they raise a 
racket ; 
They gave the chambermaid the run, 
And chased her out with a 
Gatling gun. 
_Nobody knows, etc 
A week ago a 
boarder skipped, 
Faith, out of the window he fired his grip; 
He lowered his trunk down with a 
rope, 
And then for a 
freight train he did slope; 
Next morning when they called the roll 
The landlord blessed his darling soul; 
His daughter she squealed out, " Oh laws! 
He's given us the finger for three weeks board."

PARODY ON BABIES ON OUR BLOCK.—CONTINCED. 
Parody on Babies on Our Block. 
Writ ten and sung by Billy Carter with great sto:N,Qss 
Yon can talk of ugly babies, 
on our block it is a 
sight, 
T.• see a 
thousand babies chaw 
And claw with all their might. 
Tit , 
re is pug-nosed babies, goggle-eyed kids, 
And some of the good old stock, 
It 
a 
regular menagerie, 
The babies on the block. 
Mrs. Grady's got a 
baby 
That talked before ' twas born, 
Another by the name of Simpson, 
With a 
nose like a 
Wm. goat's horn ; 
They'll get squalling and bawling, 
And they'd gather in a 
flock, 
Barnum ought to make a 
call 
On the babies on our block. 
CHORUS. 
tt, 
Little Johnny Toothpick 
And Susan Turpentine, 
A 
crying and a 
fighting, 
And a 
singing Baby Mine; 
They'd take the chromo cake and all 
For smashing Grandpa's clock, 
They'd win the prize for swallowing dies, 
These babies on our block. 
There's an Italian kid just two years old, 
With eyes in the back of his head, 
You can guess how the daddy feels 
When the young one's hair is red ; 
Some have got no eyes, and some have got no nose, 
And a 
black and tan kid 
With an elephant hoof 
And forty-leven toes ; 
Some's dramatic, some's lunatic, 
One kid has a 
wooden ear, 
Another one, they call Napoleon, 
Drinks his barrel of lager beer. 
They'll rear and tare, 
And pull their hair, 
Until your nerves they shock, 
They'll scream and yell, 
And raise old fun, 
The babies on our block. 
CHORUS. 
Little Sally Falseteeth, 
Sitting in a 
custard pie, 
A 
crying 'cause her little brother 
Slugged her in the eye. 
Rise, Sally, rise, knock his eye out with a 
rock, 
For there's a 
hundred times more babies 
Than there's daddies on our block. 
Parody on " Sandy-Haired Mary in our Area," as sung by 
HARRIGAN 8: H ART. 
Written by EDWIN TALBOT. 
I 
board at Mrs. Reilly's, 
I 
have a 
big back room; 
There's a 
little Italian fairy, 
That has me gone to ruin. 
Her name is Katy Brady, 
And every night at eight; 
Sweet sounds of music, 
By our Red-Haired Kate. 
CITORUS: 
I'm her daisy, she's my love, 
She ain't the only one I 
love, 
She's a 
gem, yes, she is silly, she's airy; 
She's a 
cake, don't mistake, 
She'll be Mrs. Brogan yet, 
Dear Red-Haired Katy so contrary. 
See smiles at every Peeler, 
Traveling on the Street; 
The Ash-man in the morning, 
He has such awful feet. 
The Tarrier keeps the Grocery, 
He swears he will her mate; 
And hugs her, yes, the rascal, 
Contrary Red-Haired Kate. 
I'm her dabL etc. 
RED-1-1AIREID KATY SO CONT-RARY—CONTINUED. 
The man who carries banners, 
The old Hibernian Clown; 
He hollers in the alley, 
For Katy to come down. 
It makes me nearly looney, 
To see her start a 
gait; 
To smile upon the Tarrier, 
With the Red- Haired Pate. 
I'm her daisy, etc. 
The Junk- man and the Tailor, 
The Beggar for his Bread; 
The Bummer and the Bruiser, 
Have nearly killed me dead. 
A crazy Cabinet-maker, 
Has broken me heart complate; 
He elopes with her next Tuesday, 
My darling Red- Haired Kate. 
CHORUS: 
I'm her daisy, she's my love, 
She ain't the only one I 
love, 
She's a 
gem, yes, she's silly, she's airy; 
She's a 
cake, don't mistake, 
She'll be Mrs. Brogan yet, 
Dear Red-Haired Katy so contrary.

Don't Forget a 
Friend. 
Written and sung by Charles II. Duncan. 
Copyrighted by 
George D. Newhall, Cincinnati. 
All through this world are many things - 
That puzzle and perplex, 
And many of us find in life occurrences that vex. 
The high, the low, the rich, the poor, 
Meet equal in the end, 
Though some may sneer and put on airs, 
With what good luck may send, 
Yet he who takes us by the hand 
And wishes us success 
We'll not forget in future, though 
His fortune may grow less ; 
We'll try to aid him, cheer him 
Upward, onward to the end, 
For should reverses come to us 
1101 not forget a 
friend. 
CHORUS. 
Oh don't forget a 
friend, 
Pray, don't forget a 
friend; 
Let this your motto be through life,. 
Pray don't forget a 
friend. [ Repeat.] 
The drunkard whom you pass with scorn 
Was once respected, too, 
And when a 
child, a 
mother's love 
lie had, as well as you. 
When money filled his pockets 
lie was hail good fellow then, 
But now, that all his. 
cash 
has flown, forgotten by most men. 
But now that all his cash has flown, 
Forgotten by most men. 
Let this a 
lesson be to you : 
Be temperate in all things, 
And (rive your fellowman a 
lift, 
Whom err misfortune brings, 
You cannot tell from day to day 
What others they may semi. 
Let this your motto be through life 
Pray don't forget a 
friend.

I'll Bet You a 
Dollar You Don't, 
Sung with great success by EDWIN BARRY. 
Does any one know what I'm going to say ? 
I'll bet you a 
dollar you don't. 
If I 
lose the wager, will any one pay, 
I'll bet you a 
dollar you don't. 
Gay bachelors say they shall never take wives, 
For as each in his way to be happy contrives, 
They mean to keep single the rest of their lives. 
But I'll bet you a 
dollar they don't. 
Find an Irish election without any row, 
I'll bet you a 
dollar you don't, 
Or a 
sin1 who objects to a 
mistletoe bough, 
I'll bet you a 
dollar you don't. 
Some years of experience teaches me this— 
That from seven to ninety both Mrs. and Miss 
May refuse you this ancient excuse for a 
kiss. 
But I'll bet you a 
dollar they don't. 
You may see vaccination a 
thing of the past, 
I'll bet you a 
dollar you don't. 
And heavy taxation abolished at last, 
I'll bet you a 
dollar you don't. 
You may see old John Bull dwindle down to a 
calf, 
And his provender nothing but foreigners' chaff. 
You may see all the ladies too quiet by half, 
But I'll bet you a 
dollar you don't. 
Some ignorant croakers wear visages long, 
Will you bet me a 
dollar they don't? 
And say that to visit amusement is wrong, 
Will you bet me a 
dollar they don't ? 
Though to succor distress they can never afford, 
Above human vices they always have soared, 
Still somehow they know every move on the board, 
Will you bet me a 
dollar they don't? 
A 
married man often tries to prove cock-o'-the-walk, 
But I'll bet you a 
dollar he don't. 
If he tries to sleep when his wife wants to talk, 
I 
shall bet him two dollars he don't. 
So all you young girls, please attend to this verse, 
And go and get married for better or worse, 
And two little armfuls you may have to nurse, 
Won't bet a 
dollar you don't.

Performed by WALSII and KING 
We're two roving Irish ntades 
And from Paddy's land we've strayed, 
That dear old Emerald Isle we do adore, 
Sure we started you must know 
But a 
few short months ago, 
And landed lately on Columbia's shore. 
CHORUS. 
You will find us full of joy and pleasure, 
Our equals nowhere can be found, 
If you'll list to us the while 
We will for you the time beguile 
An show you how we dance in Dublin town. 
Now we work hard all the day, 
But at night we feel as gay 
As when we started in the morn, 
And while the stars shine bright, 
We will while away the night, 
And never quit our dancing till the dawn. 
You will find u.% &c.

" 
THE ASH BOX INSPECTOR," 
My name is Owen Slattery, I 
am a 
cobbler by trade; 
By mending your shoes me money I 
made. 
I 
have a 
devil's own wife, I 
wish she was dead; 
She can sing tralaloo, and she stands on her head. 
It was only last night that me daughtci Kate Ann 
Invited to supper a 
handsome young man. 
'When asked his name he said it was Spoons, 
Recommended by Barnum for juggling spittoons. 
" 
Me fine laddie buck," says I, " March out of here, 
Or be the ghost of old Foley, I 
will bite off your ear." 
He made a 'rush for the door, with a 
lump on his skull. 
He thought I 
was Ajax, or else Sitting Bull. 
Me wife, in a 
flutter, seized hold of a 
brick, 
And called me a 
slugger and flannel-mouth Mick. 
'

guy."

made a 
short stop on the ball of her eye. 
There's Pat McNamara, from sweet Donegal, 
The ash box inspector, elected last fall ; 
He wears a 
gold watch and chain and a 
scented boquet, 
I 
wish that the devil may wid him fly away. 
It was only this morning he sent me a 
card 
To fresco thc alley, and whitewash the yard. 
Bad luck to the sucker, if I 
had him here, 
1 
would play seven-up on the edge of his ear.

Oh, I 
came to this country a 
short time ago, 
To better my fortune to find, 
For the old country, sure, is a 
very hard place, 
For any poor hard-working boy. 
But it's little better here, to my sorrow I 
find, 
As I 
search for employment each day, 
And to get it I 
can't; and the reason is this, 
Just because I 
am Irish, they say. 
CHORUS. 
Just because I 
am Irish they would give me no work, 
Just because I 
am Irish they cry, 
But where ever I 
go, in good fortune or woe, 
I 
will still be a 
true Irish boy. 
Aint it bard now,I ask you,that such things should be 
In a 
country where all are free men ? 
What have Irishmen done, now I 
plainly ask you, 
That such slurs should be cast upon them ? 
In America's troubles in days long ago, 
In the battle fields, fiercest arrayed, 
They did nobly fight for their God and the right, 
" 
Just because I 
am Irish," they cry. 
(Ch01'218.) 
I 
will say little more; I 
don't wish to offend, 
As my aim it is ever to please, 
And this world is a 
hard one to the poor,you all know 
With but little comfort and ease, 
There's a 
haven of rest away up in the skies 
That is evef pleasant and fair, 
And God, in His Infinite mercy, I 
know, 
Will admit all good Irishmen there, 
(Chorus.)

AIR—My Pretty Jane. 
My watch, my watch, I

told my darling wife I 
lost it, 
While hunting for stumps in Prospect Park.

There's a 
barber shop run by an Irish Italian, 
And the chair he shaves you in is full of tacks, 
He'll cut your hair with an eight-day shovel. 
And shave you with a 
pen- knife or an axe. 
Ain—Scotch Lassie Jane. 
Oh, there lives a dizzy dame on the hills of Harlem Flats 
She makes shirts and takes in scrubbing by the dozen,

AIR—Bogie Man. 
Nix, nix, nix, the bartender he will drop, 
Don't you try to hang him up, or he will call a

keg of beer. 
AIR—Full Moons.

There you'll find the bums a-sleeping, 
Just as quiet, quiet as a 
mouse.

STOP AS LONG AS YOU USED TO. 
As sung with great success by Miss JENNIE H UGHES. 
I 
know a 
jolly old bachelor, 
-Who lives next door to me, 
Though he is thought a 
bit of a 
bore, 
In jolly good company; 
For he is such an inquisitive man, 
That if you e'er should meet, 
He'll button- hole you if he can, 
And give you the following treat. 
CH0Rus.—Does your mother take in washing ? 
Has she sold her man gle ? 
What's become of the old piano, 
Your sister used to strangle? 
Has your father plenty of work ? 
Does be still get boozed too ? 
Tell me all the particulars, 
And stop as long as you used to. 
Now this old man has lots of wealth, 
So he's not without a 
few, 
Choice friends who'll call to drink his health, 
And borrow a 
pound or two; 
But the old man cross-examines them so, 
That they're glad to get away, 
As rich as they came, and as out they go, 
With a 
grin on his face he will say. 
CHORUS.—Does your mother, &c. 
This bachelor's blessed with a 
lovely niece 
his heiress, so they say, 
So I 
thought I'd try to be in the piece, 
And told my love one day : 
"Oh! speak to my Uncle, sir," she said, 
" 
With his consent we'll wed," 
So I 
asked him if she could be my bride, 
When be drew me aside, and said. 
CHORUS.—Does your mother, &C 
The ladies give him their sweetest smile, 
And Hatter and coax him so, 
But he can see through their artful wiles, 
Though his knowledge lie does not show, 
They make him presents of gloves and ties, 
And handkerchief's whit.e as snow, 
Which he will wave before their eyes, 
As he asks with a chuckle and crow. 
CLIORUS.—Does your mother, &c.

THE WEED ON THE HAT. 
A 
Parlor Recitation by JERRY Comm 
He'd a 
weed on his hat, this sad stranger, 
His clothing, tho' shabby, was black; 
His countenance seemed to grow paler, 
As he walked with his hands at his baA. 
I 
wondered if he was reflecting 
On bitter, sad things past and dead; 
His mind, seemed to me, as rejecting 
Those things, for he oft shook his head! 
But plainer than words did the hat with the weed, 
Tell a 
story of mourning and sorrow, indeed. 
He sat in a 
chair at the table, 
His eyes fixed steadfast on the floor; 
I 
sympathized, but was scarce able 
To tell him I 
pitied him sore; 
My glance caught his eyes as he raised them, 
My pity he seemed to detect; 
" 
This world's a 
sad dream," he exclaimed, then, 
I 
listened with silent respect— 
For I 
felt that a 
sorrowing soul was in need 
Of a 
friend that could feel, as I 
looked at the weed 
He gazed on the floor for a 
minute, 
Then mournfully sighing, he said, 
" 
Ah, yes; a 
sad dream; nothing in it; " 
Then I 
asked, " if his mother was dead?" 
"No?" " Perhaps some dear sister or brother?" 
He answered, " I 
never had One; " 
" 
Some near, dear relation or other?" 
lie replied, " There are none of them gone." 
-Yet no common sorrow could make a 
heart bleed, 
Like the heart of the man with the hat with a 
weed. 
23 
'I FIE WEED ON THE HAT—CosTiNvED. 
llis mood changed. " Why question ? " he t 
hundaal, 
As he suddenly 'sprang to his feet; 
" 
Dost consider me prey to be plundered, 
By confidence man, and dead beat? 
Or art thou an Epitaph maker? 
As your questions would seem to imItly? 
Or Tomb-stone man? Leech? Undertak; r ? 
Which, or either? Come answer, thou 
Then I 
stammered and stuttered, embarrns ed, i 
tit l!'ed 
Not a 
word could I 
utter, but point to the weed. 
The tierce light left his eye; " oh!" he muttered, 
" 
My violence pardon, he's dead; " 
Then his thanks for my pity he uttered, 
" 
His memory I 
revere," he said; 
" 
This weed on my hat's a 
memento, 
Of a 
father beloved, but now gone; " 
" 
Your Father? I 
asked:" No, his Country's, 
I 
mourn for dear George Washington; 
Then I 
borrowed a 
gun to accomplish a (Iced, 
Twas to shoot—not the man—but the hat with the 
weed. 
PAT MALONY'S FAMILY, 
wntten alio sung by ED. EARRIGAN, in Harrigan & Harts 
sketch, " who owns the Line.? 
ME name is Mike Malony, 
I'm a 
carpenter by trade; 
I 
married Molly Higgins, 
Who all my trouble made. 
She'd as many of relations 
As fishes in the sea; 
They ate me out of house and home, 
And destroyed me tamily. 
CHORUS. 
There's her father, 
And her mother, 
And tier sister, 
And her brother. 
1700 babies laying on their knees, 
her uncles and her cousins, 
And aunties by the dozen 
Lived upon the earnings of Patrick Malons 
Iffy pants would fit her uncle, 
her dress would tit her niece; 
I 
have to sleep upon the root; 
Or I 
never have no peace. 
They made me buy them dainties; 
Root Deer by the pail; 
I'd have to wait ' till they were full 
Before I'd git me male. 
CHORUS. 
There was pudding, 
There was mutton 
That would make you burst a 
button. 
And a 
fiery- head Corkonian 
By the name ot Pat Cloney, 
To superintend the table, 
To put me in the stable 
While they ate up all the labor of Patrick Afaloni 
Her uncle wore my stockings, 
My hat would fit his head; 
When tired out wid labor 
They'd kick me out of bed. 
I 
put up every pinny 
For to keep them from Bellevue, 
I 
wish the coroner would sit 
On my wife and all her crew. 
C EIORUS. 
'There's her nephews 
And her nieces 
That come from several places, 
1700 grandmothers 
And mothers-in-law you see; 
A 
wagon load of Dalys; 
McSweegan and the rialys 
Lived on the earnings of Patrick Malolly. 
There's her second cousin's brothel., 
And his toothless old step-mother. 
And 1600 emigrants from Ireland you see. 
Wid their boxes and their bedding. 
On my Ingrain carpet treading, 
They lived upon the earnings of Patrick Malolly. 
CHORUS. 
There's the Drabs 
And the Gradys— 
Dacent perfect ladies, 
Always axing charity 
From my family you see.

The other was a

this song. 
I 
suppose that you've all heard of me, 
I 
am known all over town, 
I 
am Michael John O'Rafferty, 
And my name is heard all round, 
I've a 
watch that's worth a 
dollar note, 
And a :-
.! razy horse ...nd hack, 
I'm heir to Dan J.Connell's hat, 
And I'll never take it back. 
CHORUS. 
I 
never was an alderman, 
Though I 
have friends by the score. 
I 
am a 
man of great high standing, 
And of learning I 
have galore, 
I 
hold a 
high position, I 
Superintend the horse car track, 
I 
am an Italian ambassador in disguise, 
And I'll never take it back. 
I 
stand solid, too, with all the boys, 
My goodnature can't be beat, 
When I 
meet them in a 
barroom, 
No one else but ie will treat. 
I've been to Saratoga 3prings, 
New York and 3allymazack, 
I've traveled as a 
sand bag with Jem Mace, 
And I'll never tsake it sack. 
Of all the strangest girls on earth, 
I 
think my girl's the one; 
You know she has peculiar ways, 
And quite devoid of fun. 
She never sees a 
joke of mine, 
'Whenever humor flows, 
But gives me a 
disdainful look 
And quite turns up her nose. 
SPOKEN—
Some girls like a 
little joke, you know, but minc, 
don't, she turns her nose up at it. 
I 
think she works it on 
the same principle as this (turning up nose with jfnger). 
CHORUS. 
Some girls do, and some girls don't, 
Some girls will, but my girl won't; 
I 
tried very hard to see if she would, 
She said she really couldn't, and I 
don't think she could 
I 
took my love to see the play, 
As other fellahs do; 
And thought that she'd enjoy herself, 
She cried the whole night through. 
And when we reached the street again, 
Some oysters I 
proposed, 
But she said, " No, not me, young man," 
Still turning up her nose. 
SPOKEN—Up 
it went again at three dozen of ales best 
Saddle Rocks, just think of that. 
To see a 
girl turn up het 
nose at five cents a 
time. 
I 
said, " Well, my love, if yolk 
29 
won't have any supper, we will have a 
cab and go home." 
She replied, " No, young man, no four-wheeled cabs for me 
at this time of night." 
Some girls do, &c. 
We met one Sunday afternoon, 
For a 
day in Central Park; 
And when we mounted " One tree hill" 
We had, well, say a 
lark ! 
Georgina said, " You know, young man, 
Some girls prefer a 
stroll ; 
Not me, when I'm in Central Park 
I 
dearly love a 
roll!" 
SPOKEN—NOW, there's an extraordinary girl for you. 
Of 
course, I 
wanted to take her for a 
nice quiet lover's walk in 
some shady lane, but she said she'd prefer a 
roll. 
Then I 
wanted to talk to her of love, romance, and poetry, but no, 
she said she'd " sooner have a 
good dinner." 
Well, 
Some girls do, &c. 
Not long ago my uncle died 
And left me fifty pounds; 
As soon as I 
received the news 
My joy it knew no bounds. 
I 
thought, well, I 
will marry now, 
So I 
at once proposed; 
But when I 
mentioned the amount 
Up went hr lovely nose. 
SPOKEN—The bad girl, she said she ought to have five 
hundred with such a 
man as me. I 
thought she would have 
jumped at me, you know, for, 
Some girls do, Ste, 
Widow Dunn (Parody). 
Sung by Billy Carter. 
Dedicated to Harrington and Hart, 
I 
know a 
big fat widow, 
That keeps a 
livery stable, 
A making beds for horses that are sick, 
She's an awful early riser, 
And a 
champion appetizer, 
Like an eight-day clock 
She goes around on tick. 
She's from the country poor-house, 
Her husband was a 
tramp, 
In the English army he did beat a 
drum, 
And for singing tar-heeled Hanna's, 
Or murdering sick pianos, 
There's no marker for the big fat Widow nti.),t, 
CHORUS. 
She is hunky, she is chunky, 
She's as handsome as a 
monkey, 
She's a 
fairy, she's contrary, 
She's a 
lamb, .1. 
mean a 
ham, 
She's as tall as any ladder, 
I'd slug her if I 
had her, 
And kick the chest protector off the Widow Dunn. 
WIDOW DUNN ( PAnonr).—CoicTiNvEn. 
She steals the morning papers 
Away from every door, 
She's an acrobactie, break-neck son of a 
gun. 
And at every wake or funeral, 
She goes to sing and dance, 
Such a 
tender creature is the widow Dunn. 
She's freckled, but she's pretty, 
And well developed feet, 
She has one back tooth that weighs a 
half a 
ton, 
And at every passing stranger 
She tires an ancient egg, 
So familiar is the Widow Dunn. 
She is moody, she is sankey, 
She's consumptive, she is crankey, 
She's rheumatic, she's lunatic, 
She's a 
bum, she weighs a 
ton, 
She is crazy, she is careless, 
She is toothless, she is hairless, 
Such a 
chromo is the big fat Widow Dunn. 
Written and composed by sem DEVERE. 
THERE has something gone wrong, 
My brave boy, it appear 
For I 
see your proud struggle 
To keep back the tears : 
That is right, when you cannot 
Give tr uble the slip, 
Then bear it, still keeping 
A 
stiff upper lip! 
Though you cannot escape 
Disappointment and care 
The next best thing to do, 
Is to learn how to bear 
If when for life's prizes 
You're running, you trip, 
Get t.p—start again, 
Keep a 
stiff upper lip! 
Let your han 's 
and your conscience 
Be honest and clean, 
Scorn to ouch or to think of 
The thing that is mean; 
But ho d 
on to the pure 
And the right with firm grip, 
And though hard be the task, 
Keep a 
stiff upper lip! 
Thro gh childhood, through manhood, 
Through life to the end. 
Struggle brAvely and stand 
By 3 
our colors, my friend, 
Only yield when you must, 
Never 
Give up the ship," 
But ti;Iit to the last 
With a 
still uper lip! 
Written by JOHN SHEEHAN, and sung by SHEEHAN & JONES. 
In Sing Sing Prison where convicts dwell, 
Many funny stories they can tell; 
In Auburn, too, they cannot lurk, 
They are provided with plenty of hard work; 
If they make a 
mishap, the punishment is hard, 
Three days breakin& stones out in the yard; 
And if one trys to mash the keepers' daughter, 
his bill of fare is bread and water. 
What are you in for? Nothing; that's what they all 
say, 
Well, I 
stole a 
suit of clothes and sold it down 
the bay; 
Say Jack it's hard, to-day I 
only eat a 
cracker, 
I'll give you a 
kiss for a 
chew of tobacco; 
The Keeper will drop, I 
heard him yell, 
Nix, or he'll sentence us to the dark cell; 
It's too bad about Jimmy, in life he might have 
risen, 
Only think of dying in a 
lonely State's Prison. 
Who is that fellow Keeper Twelve sent to bed? 
If I 
catch him in the Shoeshop I'll break his head; 
You better let him alone, Mike, the punishment is 
deep, 
Four days without food, and four days without 
sleep; 
Look what he done when Kelly gave him the slip, 
Every day gave him a 
stroke with the whip; 
Well I 
don't give a 
cent, I'll make somebody cry, 
I'll give any Keeper sauces me a 
smash in the eye.

And I 
tell you by the way, 
I'll have none of their connivings, 
I'm bound to have my say. 
They may call him this, and call him that, 
I 
don't give that, for their call, 
I'm bound to call him Dennis, 
Or he'll have no name at all.

THE SPORTING MAN.

Written by HARRY BENNETT expressly for JAMES O'NEIL, of O'NEIL 
S
.7 Commit, Irish Comedians, Vocalists and Sketch Artists. 
I'm something of a 
sporting man, I 
often make a 
bet, 
stand a 
chance of loosing, but I 
have not done it yet; 
I'm something of a 
wrestler, I 
often take it in, 
But when I 
take a 
thoroughbred, my chances are but slim; 
A 
little bit of pleasantry occurred the other night, 
I 
went to see a 
wrestling match which ended in a 
fight; 
A Dutchman, a 
Scotchman, a 
Frenchman and a 
Mick, 
And poor Johnny Reilly got plugged with a 
brick. 
Cnonus: 
Nobody knows what trouble was there, 
Nobody knows I 
do declare; 
Nobody knows what fun I 
did see; 
Nobody knows indeed but me. 
Now the cause of all the trouble I 
couldn't keep it mum, 
Some one called Jerry McIntyre a 
bum; 
Jerry :jumped up, struck out with his hand, 
And swore he could whip any cripple in the land; 
Big John Monahan standing in the door, 
lie caught hold of McIntyre, and threw him on the floor; 
lie went for little Brady, and hit him such a 
whack, 
That he busted his undershirt plum off of his back. 
Oh when Brady he got up, he was a 
terrible looking sight, 
lie looked as if he slept with the pigs all night; 
Ile looked at his undershirt and then he dropped a 
tear, 
And the ,' 
he flew for Monahan and chewed off his ear; 
ie made one brace and landed at the bar, 
called for a 
hummer, and they gave him a 
cigar; 
lie took a 
match to light it, and what do you suppose, 
It was chock full of powder, and it blew off his nose. 
Then they fought in the hallway, they fought in a 
room, 
And the things they used for boxing gloves was the bat 
room spittoons; 
They couldn't see each other they welted so hard, 
They set fire to the house and fought out in the yard. 
The police all came down in big platoons, 
And quick gathered up every fighting gossoon; 
Six months on the Island sure they all have to stay, 
For setting fire to the house on St, Patrick's Day.

But I

And a

For here comes Mickey Duff. 
Now there's my friend John Hogan. 
Says that I'm too bran new, 
Hc will hire me for an elephant, 
To go with Barnum's show. 
And all the boys they laugh at me

And I

Music by H. N. SAWYER. 
Oh, skies were bright and blue, 
And merry little robins were a-singing ; 
I 
strolled the garden through, 
Where butterflies were gaily winging; 
The breath of fragrant dew

met 
My pretty little sweet blush rose ;

Where sunbeams dance, ( Break.) 
Shyly stealing glances, ( Break.) 
Weaving fairy fancies, ( Break.) 
Oh, in this heart she blooms and grows, 
My pretty little sweet blush rose. 
The flow'rets peeped around, 
All nodding to their queen a 
merry greeting; 
A 
lovely bower we found, 
Where lily bells so fair were meetin ; 
A 
voice of silvery sound 
Its tender little promise was repeating, 
How two lips met, can you forget, 
My pretty little sweet blush rose? 
[Repeat last two lines,then Chorus.] 
Bright stars were in the sky, 
And roses in their sily'ry light were sleeping; 
The day had glided by, 
We thought the jealous hours were creeping; 
We parted with a 
sigh, 
Oh, ever in my heart my rose I'm keeping, 
Yes, stars will set ere 
forget 
My pretty little sweet blush rose.

WE WANT A 
PRESIDENT, 
Where are the Old Friends. 
As sung by FRANK LEWIS, throughout the Country during 
the late exciting election. 
EXCITEMENT now is all the rage in these United States, 
The people want to know who'll be the lucky candidates. 
Now I 
show no partiality, while my rhymes I 
do present, 
But I 
hope we'll get an honest man for our next President. 
We want no present- taking man, who thinks of naught but gain 
We want a 
man who'll bring us back, the good old-times again. 
When peace and plenty rules the land, and funds more rightly 
spent, 
We want a 
man like honest Abe. for our next President. 
Our Country is a 
glorious one, the finest on the earth, 
We've just passed the Centennial of this great nation's birth. 
As marksmen we were champions, last September at Creedmoor 
But to make our rulers we must show a 
clearer score. 
We want no men in office who will violate their trust, 
By shielding " Crooked Whiskey Rings," or doing things unjust 
We care not for their politics, if they're on honest purpose bent, 
W e 
want a 
true and worthy statesman, for our next President. 
We want no men who try to make of politics a 
trade, 
And trieN to throw our honest name forever in the shade. 
We've had enough of Useless Grant, and his relations too, 
Wu want a 
man who'll keep his ote -1i and the constitution too. 
/e do not want a 
wooden man., we do not want a 
fool, 
e 
want a 
man with ;:omr-ton sea-..; who can't be made a 
tool. 
We want a 
man like Wrshington, who never stole a 
cent, 
'c 
imis Country will be bles' with am' lion:

Where are the old friends I 
knew long ago ? 
Where are the kind hearts with love to bestow ? 
Lonely I 
wander where once I 
was gay, 
Dreaming of joys that have faded away. 
Back like a 
stranger I 
come from afar, 
Seeking in vain for my welcoming star! 
Bright were my hopes, but I 
feel them depart— 
Where are the old friends so dear to my heart ? 
CHORUS. 
Where are the old friends I 
knew long ago ? 
Where are the kind hearts with love to bestow ? 
Lonely I 
wander where once I 
was gay, 
Dreaming of joys that have faded away, 
(Repeat chorus.) 
Where are the lov'd ones that wish'd me good-bye ? 
Wild are the echoes that give me reply ; 
Strangers have come to the home of my heart, 
Sweet home of childhood again we must part ! 
When far away in my silence and pain, 
Hope gave me courage to come back again ; 
Strangers now greet me, oh why did I 
come! 
Where are the old friends, and where is my home ? 
Where are the old friends, &c. 
Where is the fair one I 
ne'er could forget? 
Her last word at parting is dear to me yet ; 
Vain were my dreams of her dear eyes of blue, 
Vain is the love I 
have brought back so true. 
Sad and forsaken my life now must be, 
No ray of sunshine is beaming for me ; 
Toss'd is my bark on a 
wild darken'd shore, 
Far from the old friends that greet me no more. 
Where are the old friends, &c.

When Summer Flowers are Withered. 
Sung by J. F . 
FIELDS, with 
HANsoN, of Barlow, Wilson, 
Primrose and West's Minstrels. 
When summer flowers are withered, 
And lost their sweet perfume, 
And autumn's chill and mournful winds 
Have laid them in their tomb, 
We seek the leaf strewn valleys, 
And wander where they grew, 
And think with dark and beating heart, 
We soon must follow too. 
When summer flowers are withered, 
And lost their sweet perfume, 
And autumn's chill and mournful winds 
Have laid them in their tomb ; 
And autumn's chill and mournful winds 
Have laid them in their tomb. 
When summer flowers are withered, 
'Tis sweet for us to know, 
That when the wintry days have passed, 
Those beauteous ones will blow, 
And when the golden sunshine 
Comes down from warmer skies, 
The flowers we lost in autumn's hours, 
Again will greet our eyes. 
*When summer flowers are withered 
'Tis sweet for us to know, 
That when the wintry days have passed 
Those beauteous ones will blow ; 
Then when the wintry days have passed 
Those beauteous ones will blow. 
Why Did, My Sosie 
? 
Written by Wm. J. Scm.a.oN, of SceNnon & Cnoratz. 
I 
went up to Barnum's a 
short time ago, 
The circus of course there to see, 
The evening being fine and to spend a 
nice time, 
I 
brought my dear Josie with me. 
She seemed so delighted it made me feel good, 
My heart with joy it did beat, 
And when it was over we started to go 
From the circus out into the street. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, my 1 
wasn't it fine, 
Oh, how the riders did shine, 
The clown he was laughing, talking and chaffing, 
My little Josie she laughed all the time. 
Last night when we reached my dear Josie's home, 
She said, now don't think me a 
bore 
If I 
ask you to call here again to- morrow night, 
To the circus we'll go just once more. 
My answer was yes, of course, my dear Joe, 
What e'er your request it may be, 
I'll grant it, my love, if it lies in my power, 
For my love it is always with thee. 
(Chorus.) 
Next evening again to the circus we went, 
My Josie she looked like a 
queen, 
When the riders came out they all looked at her, 
She very much embarassed did seem, 
But, alas! she cried out to the man in the ring, 
My darling, I'm waiting for thee, 
She jumped from my side to my great surprise, 
And every one there laughed at me. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, my! why did she go ? 
Oh, why did she treat me so, 
She was my darling, always so charming, 
None in this world like my own little Joe.

There are songs unsung in ev'ry heart, 
Some beautiful memory hidden, 
That nestles alone in its resting place, 
By sorrow and tear-drops hidden, 
Some sad, sad hope that once did bloom, 
When life was gay and young, 
But now it is faded, and withered, and dead. 
Oh ! beautiful songs unsung. 
CHORUS— 
Beautiful songs unsung, 
Sorrowful songs unsung, 
Oh ! nestle alone in thy secret place, 
Oh! sorrowful songs unsung. 
There are songs unsung, there are tales untold, 
Whose memory never can perish, 
For the hearts that know them are hearts of gold, 
And they keep them to love and to cherish. 
Tho' some are sombre and sad and drear, 
To the lives of the saddened they're clung, 
They are set in tears and never can die, 
Oh! sorrowful songs unsung, 
Beautiful songs unsung, &c. 
There are songs unsung, there are words of love. 
That in kindness and truth were spoken, 
But now are the links of a 
glad, wild dream, 
Cherished and loved, yet broken. 
And, oh! to the heart that knows them so well, 
They've the sweetest of thoughts among, 
For they seem like a 
life that was kissed by death, 
Oh! sorrowful sungs unsung.

To support my family. 
I

Right to my home I 
go, 
My wife she meets me with a 
smile, 
My children do also, 
It's take a 
chair and do sit down 
And rest yourself dear dad, 
For we know your tired and worn out 
From carrying the hod.

GOD BLESS OUR DEAR OLD FLAG. 
GOD HELP OUR SUFFERING POOR. 
Dedicated to my esteemed friend Mtss C. 
E. 
DE 
SHEPPARD, 
with best wishes. 
Original song, as sung by FRANK LEWIS, at 
the New National Theatre, Philadelphia. 
IN this glorious land of freedom, exciting times have been, 
I 
often picture in my mind, each great and stirring scene. 
I 
never looked upon the place, where our starry flag did fly, 
But the great events of by-gone days, to picture them I'd try. 
'Twas a 
noble sight at Yorktown, when Washington did stand, 
And took the sword from that great lord, who did invade our 
native land. 
He tried his best to win the fight, and low our banner drag, 
But the Yankee boys rose in their might, and saved our dear 
old flag. 
Again when shot and shell they flew, like hailstones thick and 
fast, 
A 
gallant youth he braved them all, as he clung to the mast. 
He seized our country's emblem, which had been shot away, 
And waved it in the foeman's face, way down in Mobile bay, 
A Yankee cheer it then went up, in triumph from our fleet, 
And soon the enemy gave way, defeated, cowed and beat, 
The boy descended to the deck, of Farragut we brag, 
And every brave tar with joy cried out, " God bless our dear 
own old flag." 
Again when trouble came us o'er, and darkest was the hair, 
A 
noble general staunch and brave, he proved his mighty power. 
He stood upon the battle plain, as thousands did him fight, 
His emblem was our Stars and Stripes, his motto " Truth and 
Right." 
Though treated bad by friends at home, he scorned the fight to 
yield, 
He swore he'd win the victory, or perish on the field. 
lie led his columns manfully, repelled each fierce attack, 
The battle was Antietam boys, the hero, Little Mac. 
And when the great Centennial came, each nation in this world, 
Did bless our glittering emblem, when its bunting wasctfurl'd. 
They came from Asia's sandy plains, from Afric's burning clime, 
From far Australia's lonely wilds, from Europe's sunny Rhine. 
They came to see the poor man's home, where the Sun sinks in 
the West, 
Where every wanderer finds a 
bed, and is with plenty blest. 
And when our banner bright went up, no tyrants flaunting rag, 
The nations all with joy they cried, God bless that dear old flag I 
Written and sung by W ILL. H. MORTON With HARRIGAN SI 
HART'S Combinatica. 
While the sad cry of hard times resound through our land 
Do we give enough thought to the poor; 
Are we one and all ready to lend helping hand, 
To drive the grim wolf from the door. 
The selfish may think that kind fortune has dealt, 
With them and their own to secure 
The comforts and blessings that money can bring, 
But God help our suffering poor. 
There are plenty we meet who could help if they would, 
But the fact is their money's all spent; 
They're too poor themselves, or they ain't in the rhood, 
Or some other excuse they'll invent. 
But ask you rich banker how much in his vaults 
These men have placed there to secure; 
And he'll tell you, if honest, their assertions are false, 
They could help our suffering poor. 
Can any one tell why those seeking for aid 
Always pass millionaires with distrust? 
Can it be solemil :.ruth, what I've often heard said, 
That the rich seldom give e'en a 
crust? 
But there's the mechanic and laboring man, 
Ever ready to share his small storP, 
For nearly each one knows how ' tis himself, 
God bless these true friends to the Door.

Ilere's a 
pretty little maiden, 
That I 
ever shall adore, 
in It aly that bright and sunny land; 
Hy life would be a 
pleasure, 
I 
would wish for nothing more, 
If she would only share my heart and hand; 
Her father is a 
brigand, 
On a 
lonely mountain pass, 
And with him on the mountain she does dwell; 
There is no titled lady, 
In all Europe can surpass, 
That dear Italian girl I 
love so well. 
Clionus: 
Though her father is a 
brigand on the mountain, 
She's as gentle as the daughter of an Earl; 
And although she set me free, 
My heart will ever be, 
A captive to that dear Italian girl. 
While roaming lovely valleys, 
'Neat!' the blue and sunny skies, 
A band of sturdy brigands bold and strong, 
Did capture me, and helpless, 
With a 
bandage o'er my eyes, 
A victim, T 
was quickly led along, 
Five thousand pounds as ransom, 
They demanded I 
should pay, 
But that I 
was not rich enough to give, 
And only for the pleadings 
Of that little mountain maid, 
They would not have permitted me to live. 
(Chorus). 
They put me in a 
dungeon 
Where T 
thought that I 
should die, 
And while the brigand chief with all his band, 
Were plundering poor travelers, 
This lovely girl came nigh, 
In gloomy night and by my side did stand; 
She tore my bands asunder, 
Bade me rise and quickly fly, 
And from her fathers coffers gave me gold; 
And while the tears of love and pity, 
Glistened in her eye, 
The secrets of our hearts were plainly told. 
(Chorus). 
I 
bid her then to fly with me, 
And be my darling bride, 
Although her love for me was plainly shown, 
Her duty she declared, 
Was by her outlawed father's side, 
And so to America I 
returned alone; 
But I 
cannot live forever 
In this free and happy land, 
To Italy I'm going to return, 
To seek with love, and try to win, 
If only for awhile, 
That girl for whom my heart will ever vearn.

He Lost His Monkey. 
A RECITATION. 
Written by W ASH. FAVOR for FAVOR and SHIELDS. 
As I 
walked down the street, by chance I 
did meet 
A man who was riding a 
donkey, 
On his back was a 
card offering a 
reward, 
Which sed that he'd lost his monkey. 
Then the crowd, don't you see, gathered round him ana in; 
And the street then it couldn't be crossed ; 
Ile pulled out a 
big key, and pointed at me, 
And sez " There's the monkey that's lost." 
I 
sez " Get out you old lump, sure you're off of your chump, 
And look out, for I 
give you fair warning." 
So I 
up wid me stick, and I 
hit him a 
lick, 
I 
scz " I 
landed in town this morning ;" 
He threw a 
rope on the fly, and me neck he did tie ; 
The end to the gang then he tossed. 
Then he sez in a 
rage, " Haul him into the cage, 
For he is the monkey that's lost. 
So they pulled me along, yes, forty-five strong, 
Till they got me to the door of the jug. 
P. T. Barnum sez " Punk, sure you have the wrong monk" 
As soon as he looked at me mug. 
But he sez " I'll engage you to sit in a 
cage, 
And say fifty thousand you cost." 
I 
sez " Get out you old bum, Mr. P. T. Barnum, 
I'm not the poor monkey you lost."

I 
ENTERED the Park on a 
beautiful evening, 
To bask in the pleasures that nature had strewn, 
With a 
bounteous h 
ind for the rich and the poor man, 
Where flowers nestle closely in verdure's full bloom. 
A 
policeman was there, and I 
asked his permissl n 
To Nvander around through the Park with the mass 
Of the people, be answered yes, walk at your leisure, 
But be careful young man, awl keep off the grass. 
CHORUS. 
Keep off the grass, keep off the grass; 
Mind what I 
tell you, if I 
let you pass— 
Keep off the grass, keep off the grass , 
I'll bid you good evening, but keep oft the grass. 
Now I 
hadn't gone far when I 
met a 
fair charmer— 
A 
beautiful, gushing, dear little maid. 
I 
raised my chapeau. and addressed her quite blandly, 
And asked her if with me she'd 
romenade. 
She smiled and looked sweet when I 
asked her this question, 
If strolling with me half an hour she would pass, 
So sweetly she answered, " Yes, sir, with pleasure, 
I'll stroll by your side if you keep off the grass 
Keep ( ff the grass, &c. 
soon after we were married, and quickly I 
found out 
That I 
had caught a 
tartar, you bet, 
Although in some things I 
do think she's perfection, 
Yet I 
often do wish that we never had met. 
Last week I 
saw that policeman one morning, 
And I 
told him of my troubles since wedding this lass, 
But he laughed at me, when he repeated his warning, 
" 
I 
told you, young fellow, to keep off the grass." 
SPOKEN. —Now, boys, take my advice, whenever you are 
strolling in the Park, and get up a nice little flirtation with a 
pretty girl. 
Just take my advice, and—

At six o'clock in the morning

Who belong to the Rank and File. 
In the tented field of honor 
We hold our lives but small,

At the bugle's martial call.

With cheers and saddened smile,

Larry O'Leary is my name, 
A 
Philosopher and Dancing Master; 
Divil a 
one can taehe the same 
As I, and do it any faster. 
Ladies all and Gentlemen, to 
My Dancing School I 
welcome you; 
I'll show you just what I 
can do, 
And as a 
Tutor, teach to you. 
One, two, three, that's the way, 
Hear to what I 
have to say; 
To my remarks attention, pray, 
And you'll become a 
dancer. 
SPOKEN.—What's this? A letter 
for me? Reads to 
Larry O'Leary, Esq., Teacher of the Terpsichorian Art. 
Dear Sir:—That's me—This will introduce my son, Phelim 
Augustus Decanter O'Candlestick. (How dye do sir?) 
I 
would most respectfully place his feet in your hands, for 
their improvement. 
Yours, Dennis De Brass O'Candle-
Stick. (To imaginary pupil). 
Young man, your father 
does me honor. 
I 
have desired a 
Candlestick for a 
pupil, 
and I'll polish you so bright that few can stand in your 
light in dancing. 
The class in round dances are about to 
form, so pay attention. (A 
waltz in imitation of pupils). 
And now Ladies and Gentlemen, as well as being a 
Dancing 
Master, I 
am a 
Philosopher. 
The poilosophy of dancing 
THE DANCING PHILOSOPHER— CONTINUED. 
is in moving the foot wid the assistance of the head. 
The 
head controls the foot, tho' some people's feet control the 
head. 
But the modus operandi of the pedal extremities is 
a 
necessary appendage to educational propensities. 
Take 
your partners and don't forget the changes. 
First four 
right and left; then the other way; then the same thing 
over again; then repeat; and you, club-foot MacCaffrey, 
stop tickling that lady's nose with the gas-pipe; tind to 
your brogues. 
Start together like sogers; fire away! 
(Polka). 
Here, MacMorris, go to the door and scrape the 
mud from your shoes, and not on the carpet. 
Try the 
plain Polka; then glide into the Quadrille wid aise and 
grace; but, gentlemen, don't step on the ladies' bunions. 
Take your partners. 
I'll swing that good looking girl 
trteself. 
Let that red-head lady with the flat nose, dance 
with that fine ould gentleman with the false head and the: 
'bald teeth. 
No! I 
mean visa versa. 
Keep your temper 
and partners, and remember, that in order to improve, you 
.nust keep as you are. 
And now, Ladies and Gentlemen, 
(to the front), I 
propose giving everybody here a 
practical 
lesson in the philosophy of dancing. 
When you go homb 
to-night, put on a 
pair of bare-footed shoes—they're the 
handiest for the foot—step out on the carpet, and, after 
the lesson, you'll be actually surprised at the dancing you 
have—not learned. 
Now, Mr. Lysander McGillighan, dis• 
course a 
few sweet, discordant and musical measures, or, 
in the language of the poet, rasp us up an Irish Jig Dance,

Talk not of love; it gives me pain,

There, welcome, win and wear the prize,

But never, never, Lever talk of love.

Courting, Cards.—This Serieb of Cards has been arranged 
to meet a 
want frequently felt by young people—a 
want of means of 
expressing one's sentiments in such 't 
way as to be non-committal, 
Many young ladies are visited by 
ntlemen who are either too diffi-
dent or too fearful of a 
repulse, to venture upon asking the momentous 
question. The lady is restrained, by custom and a 
sense of propriety, 
from doing anything that would seem to be an unladylike encourage-
, 
merit. As a 
result of this dilemma, many lives are spent as an unloved 
tedious existence, which might have been prolonged and enjoyed in the 
happiness of matrimony. 
This pack of Cards will overcome the diffi-
culty, and being in the shape of questions and answers, will cover every 
phase of courtship. 
The sentiments conveyed therein need not be 
adopted by the parties to the game as their own, unless it accords with 
the state of their affections, which fact makes a 
further explanation un-
necessary. The playing of these Cards is not restricted to two players, 
but may be enjoyed by evening parties

panied with directions so plainly written, that, with 
a 
single perusal, any person may become an adept 
in an unfailing source of amusement. 
Read what a leading Journal says of it: 
" 
An ingenious little book of the thaumaturgic order 
has been sent us, called HUNIPTY DIIMPTY,' and bound 
in such a 
way as to give opportunity for a 
decidedly 
puzzling trick. 
While presenting the ordinary appear-
ance of a 
child's picture-book, gayly printed and colored, 
it is so bound that a 
practiced manipulator, taking it 
up, and flirting the leaves rapidly over, can make it ap-
pear to be filled with copies of only one picture, or with 
blank pages, or with any one of quite a 
succession of 
figures. 
One minute the pamphlet, quickly thumbed, 
appears to contain nothing but portraits of Harlequin, 
in his tesselated suit; the next, only Columbine; then, 
nothing but Pantaloon, or Riding Hood, or Mephisto-
pheles. 
A little practice, and the directions printed 
with the book will make anybody at home in the hand-
ling of it."—Phila. Evening Bulletin.
