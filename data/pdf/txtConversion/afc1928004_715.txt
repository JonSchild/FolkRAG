JUST GOING DOWN To. THE JAIL. 
Words by IRE BROWTIVE. 
Am.—" Just going down to the gate." 
My sweetheart's a 
terrible hitter— 
Just forty-five years is her age-
-iye fifty dollars to get her 
A job on a 
mule driving stage; 
Last night she came out of her shanty, 
And filled herself chuck with old ale, 
Then she caved in the jaw of her mother-in-law, 
And now she's going down to the jail. 
CHORUS. 
She's just going down to the jail— ta, ta— 
Just down to the old county jail; 
Paying fines makes her sick, and she can't live on tick, 
So she's just going down to the jail. 
They say she's too old for a " masher," 
But I 
tell you my darling's a 
pet; 
There never's a 
man lived could thrash her, 
She'd tackle John S. on a 
bet. 
I'll wander alone 'mongst the gin mills, 
To cheer me I'll take a " cocktail ;" 
Some day, bet your life, I'll make her my wife, 
When her six months is up at the jail. 
She's just going down to the jail, etc.

THE APOLOGY TO O'REILLT. 
NOT a 
hundred yards from where I 
stand, 
In this our glorious Union land, 
Is kept a 
first-class liquor stand 
By a 
man whose name's O'Connor. 
There's a 
man who's known both near and far, 
Who attends to Mike O'Connor's bar ; 
-Who, in our late war received no scar, 
And his name it is O'Reilly. 
Beneath our banner's starry wave, 
There's not a 
man fought half so brave, 
Or half the money for whiskey gave, 
As did McDermott. 
O'Connor's bar-room blazed with light 
On that eventful, bloody night 
That McDermott had the fearful fight 
With O'Reilly. 
With sleeves rolled up McDermott stood, 
And vowed he'd die before he would 
Say the slightest word that could, 
In any manner, be misconstrued 
Into an apology to O'Reilly. 
With a 
frowning brow and flashing eye, 
O'Reilly collared a 
glass of rye, 
Which he devoured without a 
sigh, 
Then turning to McDermott, said, 
" 
Yell alchoholic vat, you drunken loon ! 
You've no more sense than a 
gossoon !" 
"Be Heavens ! 
I'll make you change your tune,* 
Says McDermott. 
McDermott went for O'Reilly's nose, 
And on it planted fearful blows, 
Till o'er his eye a 
shanty rose, 
Erected by McDermott. 
O'Reilly fell into a 
swoon, 
With his head jammed in a 
big spittoon, 
And dreaming of Barnum's big balloon, 
The police came i
,
;‘. and collared the gang. 
THE BICYCLE CRANK. 
Words and Music by IKE BROWNE. 
The rotasie 131 this song is published by FAIRBANKS & CoLE, 121 Court st., 
Boston, Mass. 
DON'T talk of rapid transit, telephones, electric lights, 
Air navigating, roller skating, pugilistic tights; 
He's the darling of the ladies and the envy of the beaux, 
And he calls lthaself."professor" and a 
terror to his foes. 
Tile Bicycle he rides, only once get on his style, 
his act. will " knock .you silly " with the agony he'll pile. 
lie's a 
gay deceiver, Latin heaver from the Harvard rank, 
And he's known to everybody as the great Bicycle Crank. 
CIIORUS. 
" 
What a 
darling, oh my•l" the ladies they sigh, 
As he rolls round the track on his wheel mounted high. 
" 
What wouldn't I 
give, he's too sweet to live," 
This dandy, the Bicycle Crank. 
lie dreams of bicycles at night, would eat one if he could— 
Will talk of nothing else, ' tis said, nor could he if he would. 
The girl who once did love 'him dear will never be his bride; 
lie shook her in disgust, because she couldn't learn to ride. 
Ile grew So awful thin his clothes from off him dropped, 
And tho' pursued by every means,. he never could be stopped. 
Such a 
dandy, and so handy, with his legs so lean and lank, 
He's the champion of the universe, this great Bicycle Crank. 
" 
What a 
darling," etc. 
No mutter whether on his toes, or balanced on his ear, 
You'll never find him " off his base," nor ever " out of gear:" 
And tho' he never " tuniblos," you'll always find him `• 
And ever ready to " catch on " and " take the cake " or die. 
Tho his mark he may not make in Congress later on, 
A 
record surely he will leave of many trophies won; 
And by the hour, in " whiskey sour," his health will oft be 
drank, 
As the champion of champions, the great Bicycle Crank. 
" 
What a 
darling," etc.

THE HUNGRY BOARDING H OUSE. 
Written by JAmEs AleAvoy lot-O'NEIL-and CONROY. 
LT 
a 
Broadway house, across the street, 
Where all the hungry boarders eat, 
At noon they open wide their gash, 
To make short work of their soup and hash. 
At nine o'clock they slip out of - bed, 
And.fly down stairs for to be fed ; 
They clean the table as slick as a 
mouse 
In the hungry, starving boarding house, 
CHORUS. 
Nobody knows what the boarders eat— 
Pass no remarks about the meat— 
Just keep mum and close your mouth 
In the hungry, starving boarding house. 
The cooks they sleep on the second floor. 
With a 
padlock hitched on every door, 
So the hungry boarders can't get in. 
Where was Moses when they douced the glim ? 
They make them sleep up in the attic, 
And all night long they kick up a 
racket ; 
They give the chambermaid the' run, 
And chased her out with a 
Gaffing gun. 
Nobody knows, etc. 
A 
week ago a 
boarder shipped, 
Faith, out of the window he fired his grip ; 
He lowered his trunk down with a 
rope, 
And then for a 
freight train he did slope ; 
Next morning when they called the roll 
The landlord blessed his darling soul : 
His daughter she squealed out, " Oh laws ! 
He's given us the finger for threo weeks' board." 
I'LL GIVE YOU ONE MORE AS YOU GO . 
Words and Music by IKE BROwNE. 
'I-at: music of this song is published by FAIRBANKS & COLE, 121 Court St., 
Boston, Mass. 
Mr sweetheart's a 
sly little miss, 
But a 
girl NY110111 I. flintily adore; 
Though often 1 
beg for a 
kiss, 
She gives me but one, and no more. 
I 
called at her house Sunday 
And 1 
asked for a 
kiss, as her beau, 
She answered, •• You fright, don't squeeze me so tight, 
I'll give you one more as you go. 
• 
CHORUS. 
I'll give you one more as you go, 
give you one more as you go. 
She answered, ‘• You fright, don't squeeze me so tight, 
rii give you one more as you go." 
Her daddy's a 
feeling old man, 
lie's always a-
feeling for inc. 
I 
remember thispeting began 
When his daughter 1 
first went to see; 
While bidding my sweetheart good-night, 
In the usual manner, you know, 
lie exclaimed with a 
swear, as his foot smote the air, 
give you one more as you go." 
CHORUS. 
I'll
,•rive you one more as you go, 
I'll •
,ive you one more as you 
He exclaimed with a 
swear, as his foot smote the air, 
give you one more as you go." 
Oh, the dog! oh, the dog 
what a 
brute! 
He was on to inc quicker'n a 
thsh, 
lie was * stuck " on in 
eight- dollar suit, 
And to make me a 
subject for hash. 
I 
went 
over the garden wall " 
In a 
in,111ner, I 
tell you, not slow, 
While a 
voice from the house I 
heard say, " Sick him, 
Towse— 
Just give him one more as lie goes." 
CHORUS. 
Just give him one more as he goes, 
Just give him one more as he goes. 
While a

Just give him one more as he goes:'

KEEP IT DARK. 
titling in a/1 the principal Variety Theatres throughout the country, with 
tremendous success, by HARRY MONTAGUE. 
THE sun was shilling at twelve at night, 
Keep it dark 
When this individual first came to light, 
Keep it dark ! 
My mother deserted me, how could she do it ? 
My father he landed me one with his boot ; 
Some are brought up by hand—I 
was brought up by foot, 
Keep it dark ! 
You can safely believe every tale that I 
tell, 
Keep it dark ! 
For I 
never tell truth if a 
lie does as well, 
Keep it dark ! 
At school my romancing got me in a 
mess, 
For I 
was so untruthful, I 
blush to confess, 
Schoolmaster advised me to write for the press, 
Keep it dark 
The ladies wear dresses remarkably tight, 
keep it dark ! 
Their beautiful forms are developed to sight, 
Keep it dark ! 
If they took my advice, you'd certainly find 
They'd wear them much looser before than behind, 
For the very best way to bamboozle mankind, 
Keep it dark ! 
I'll let you off easily, just for a 
treat, 
Keep it dark ! 
And I'll tell you some news the next time we meet, 
Keep it dark ! 
If you don't quite agree with the things that I 
say, • 
With my rhymes on the times in my topical way, 
can easily alter them some other day, • 
But keep it dark"l 
OVER THE BARNYARD FENCE. 
Words by IRE BnowNE. 
AIR — " 
Over the Garden Wall." 
Mr love stood under a 
gooseberry tree, 
Over the barnyard fence; 
She whispered and said, •‘ Will you come to me, 
Over the barnyard fence?" 
She had " Syracuse" hair and a 
turkey-red nose; 
She wasn't very tali, so she stood on her toes, 
And many a 
time to her lips I 
have froze, 
-
 
Over the barnyard fence. 
Over the barnyard fence, 
To this dear girl's residence, 
I 
went like a 
feather in windy weather, 
For there never was ever a 
slinger of leather 
Like Uncle Si, as he raised me high 
Over the barnyard fence. 
One day I 
jumped down on the other side, 
Over the barnyard fence; 
She bravely promised with me to slide, 
Over the barnyard fence; 
But she yelled, " My mash, don't be too rash; 
Here comes my old man— he'll s:ettle your hash; 
So I 
think you'd better make a 
dash 
Over the barnyard fence," 
Over the barnyard fence, etc. 
The. old man stood under the gooseberry tree, 
Over the barnyard fence; 
He whispered, and said -lie was going for me, 
Over the barnyard fence. 
He'd a 
foot like a 
pie, and his name was Si: 
He was full of old rye—" bow's that for high?" 
And I 
jumped from the toe of his boot to the sky, 
Over tiw barnyard fence. 
Over the barnyard fence, etc.

COLLEGE DAYS. 
Words by EDWARD UA1rnA. 
3Insic by G. W. IL GutrYnr. 
sung in EDWARD IIARRI4AN 45 
great play of " Old Lavender." 
OH, many moons have passed and gone, 
Since first I 
went to sello(.1, 
At Harvard, dear old Harvard, friends, 
I 
learned the Golden Rule ; 
My classmat4s scattered here and there, 
All trod their different ways. 
I 
love to think and ponder o'er 
My youthful college days. 
(Repeat last two lines.) 
I 
remember when a 
Freshmen there ; 
My age just twenty-four, 
In the Yale and Harvard races, 
I 
always rowed stroke oar; 
Our colors—handsome scarlet .bright— 
First led the van always. 
Admired by the ladies all, 
Was I 
in college days. 
(Repeat last two lines.) 
Oh, the day when I 
did Oaduate, 
I 
was my parents' pride, 
Fitted for the bar or bench, 
A 
linguist, too, beside ; 
Socially I'd always meet 
My colleagues bright and gay, 
And toss a 
merry social glass, 
To our commencement day. 
. (Repeat last two lines.) 
Culture and intelligence 
Are qualities quite- fine, 
They help constitute the gentleman, 
In every worldly clime ; 
You may crush them dovin unto the ground 
With, poverty's cold ways, 
They'll rise again. assert their claims, 
As taught in college days. 
(Repeal last two lines.)

Br far the greatest treasure, 
And recalled with more delight, 
Was one I 
deemed a

No farmer's daughter half so sweet, 
None whose smiles were more, complete, 
Never girl who looked so sweet 
As Sally Sunday night.

With your loved one seated by the lire so bright; 
No one to listen by the dirnly-burning light— 
Sparking in the kitchen on a 
Sunday night. 
On tony watering places 
Our minds were never bent; 
For Saratoga races 
We never cared a

But many castles in the air, 
Full of hope, and pictured fair, 
Oft we've built. while seated there, 
With Sally, Sunday night.

Still. I

Of sparkin. Sunday

I LOVE THE LADIES. 
KEEP DAT LAMP A- BURNING. 
BANJO SOLO. 
Sung by TOM W ARKIELD, 
SCOTLAND, France and Germany 
Are noted for their lands 
But Cincinnati is the place to go, 
For yellow-covered hams. . 
Boston's noted for her beans, 
Made greasy so they'd slip, 
But Allegliany's the place to go 
To catch the Pittsburg grip, 
CHORDS. 
I 
love the ladies— 
They are a 
puzzle-
1 
love bull dogs— 
When they are muzzled, 
I 
love lemonades, 
I 
love chamhernmids, 
But potwrestlers they are the girls for Me, 
The Italian loves to play the organ , 
While the young ones play the fid ; 
While the monkey sits upon the box 
And smiles at all the kids. 
If you want to bear sweet music 
Take the cake clean off the griddle, 
Go to a 
shindig on Saturday night 
And hear some terrier play the fiddle.

Cor.,E, 121 Court at., 
Boston, Mass. 
Go trim dat Gospel lamp, and let it shine for all, 
To guide poor sinners onward to de fold; 
Hold high dat Gospel lamp, take care you do not fall— 
To meet ole Satan, sinners must be bold— 
And de path am rocky too, and briars prick de skin; 
Some get discouraged quick, and turn about, 
But a 
word I'll say to you, if cle golden prize you'd win, 
Remember not to let your lamp go out. 
CHORUS. 
Den keep dat lamp a-burning, 
For sinners dat am yearning-, 
To keep 'em from returning 
De debil's slaves to be; 
So spend your time in learning 
how a 
home you can be earning, 
And keep dat lamp a-burning 
To shine on you and me. 
Some takes de broad highway, do y 
lobe dar lamp behind, 
Dey think dey'll neber need it any more, 
But when darkness follows day, dey's pretty apt to find 
Dey've strayed a 
long way from de golden shore. 
Now, remember what I 
say, tho' your robes am pearly white, 
And you've golden slippers too, dem stairs to climb, 
You will never find de way out of darkness to de light, 
'Less you keep dat lamp a-burning all de time. 
Den keep dat lamp a-burning, etc.

McCORMACK, THE COPPER. 
Writtee by WILLIAM SCANLAN, and performed by SCANLAN and Caontt 
in their great sketch written by WiLmex SCANLAN, entitled 
-McCormack, the Copper." 
WIY do I 
smile ? well I 
will tell, 
My heart is filled with joy, 
I'm a 
dandy copper on the Broadway Squad, 
And a 
brave one at that am I. 
If there's a 
murder or fight about, 
You'll always find me near, 
And as I 
pass the ladies say, 
Ah! 
he a 
dear. 
CHORUS. 
I'm a 
darling, ain't I 
charming, 
And the lathes all say as I 
pass them by, 
Ain't he purty I 
ain't he lovely ! 
Dan McCormack the copper am I. (
Repeat.) 
I 
visit all the collar shops, 
About three times a 
week, 
In one of them my sweetheart works, 
And of love I 
always speak. • 
I 
acquaint her with all the acknowledgments 
Which from the public I 
receive, 
And tell her how they'll sigh and sob, 
When the force I'd have to lave. 
• I'm a 
darling, eto. 
My antecedents were high-toned, 
Respected everywhere ; 
My father could whip an elephant— 
My mother could whip a 
bear ; 
My sister could toss a 
camel, 
My brother could fight a 
fly, 
They could stand a 
rhinoceros on his head, 
And sing the Swate By-anti-Bye.

WHEN MY NOSE BEGINS TO TURN . 
PARODY ON `' WIIEN TIIE LEAVES BEGIN TO TURN." 
Words by IKE BROWNE. 
W HEN my nose begins to turn, 
And my days of credit past, 
When my legs in linen pants 
Are chilled by winter's blast, 
Then my heart is ()Nimes sad, 
And my mind is filled with doubt, 
For I 
know if I 
return 
That man will " fire me out." 
Tra, la, ht, tra, la, le. 
Now my song shall ever he, 
Oh, Min!i from o'er il 
way 
A lass of beer. I 
say. 
Tra, In, la, tra, la, le. 
Now my song shall ever be, 
Oh, bring it free to me. 
Tra, In, la, In, la, In, Ie. 
(Sing first eight lines.) 
Oh, what would this life he 
Should cheek now forsake me? 
Surely he'll not refuse a 
sup 
of whiskey strailfht to brace me up. 
Oh, it wouldn't amaze me 
If he in wrath should " raise" me, 
This man who " fired " me out, 
This man who " tired " me out. 
When my nose begins to turn, 
When my nose begins to turn.

.As soon as I 
got married, • 
A happy mall to be, 
My wife turn'd Out a 
sorry jade— 
We never could agree ; 
For what I 
thought my greatest bliss, 
Was grief that made me sore : 
And now my only sorrow is— 
She's mine forevermore. 
CHORUS. 
We can't agree, we can't agree ; 
I 
scowl at her, she scowls at me ; 
Such despair I 
have to hear. 
0, would that I 
vere free ! 
From noon till night we scold and fight 
0. such a 
matrimonial blight ! 
Death alone can set me right ! 
We can't, we can't agree. 
About a 
week or something less 
A 
gentle thing was she, 
But ere the second Sunday came 
She had tlw best of me : 
Now oftentimes I 
cry alas ! 
And sadly I 
complain, 
But with the cause of my complaint 
For life I 
must remain. 
We can't agree, etc 
When I 
am in for soberness, 
She goes distracted mad ! 
And when I 
ant for merriment, 
0 
then she's always sad ; 
And when I 
wish to hear her speak, 
She's dumb as she can he— 
No matter what we say or do, -
It seems we can't agree! 
We can't agree, etc 
Last night Tom Jenkins and myself 
Went out our throats to wet— 
She thundered in my ears so loud 
I 
think I 
hear her yet ; 
But when she gets her temper up, 
Which often is the case, 
The tinit thing, that comes to her hand 
She dashes in my face. 
We can't agree, etc 
That marriage is a 
paradise 
I've heard some people say, 
But for my own part I 
declare 
It seems the other way ! 
And yet there is a 
comfort left, 
One comfort left to me— 
The pangs of death will break the banns— 
Alas ! we can't agree. 
We can't agree, etc.

When a

A 
girl who will not kiss on the sly, 
Oh, what a

When tramps the country no more roam, 
Oh, what a

that will be; 
When mothers-in-law remain at home, 
What a 
great day that will be; 
When politicians will not fight, 
And bills are paid at once on sight, 
When babies will not squall at night, 
Oh, what a 
great day that will be. 
When a

Oh, what a

When -cucumbers refuse to gripe,

SWELLS OF THE DAY. 
Comic Song, by BEN Cou.ixs, Esq. 
Sung by PIT ROONEY. 
Copyrighted, 1879, by CLINTON V. DE W PM 
Now a 
comical song I'm going to sing, 
And I 
think you'll agree with me too, 
It's about the young men we every day meet, 
And the facts I 
believe are all true. 
They'll stand on the corner for twenty-four hours, 
They'll wink, and they'll blink, and they'll stare ; 
With Sherman House toothpicks and three-cent cigars, 
And bad hair oil all over their hair. 
CHORUS. 
They are the swells of the day, 
Oh, that's what the police all say ; 
Their gold watch is brass, their diamonds are glass, 
But still they're the swells of the day. 
They'll hang around our large hotels, 
A 
burden to the city ; 
To see them on a 
rainy day, 
Wouldn't move your pocket to pity. 
They'll spit tobacco all over the walk, 
I 
wish they were in Jerusalem ; 
There is Augustus, George, Girard, and OliTer, 
And Don Pedro alamagozlems. 
CHORUS. 
They're par excellence, 
I 
wish they'd leave the town ; 
Why can't they go out West, 
Or where they can't be found ? 
Oh my, them second-hand hats, 
Look dizzier every day; 
I 
wish they were buried with Brigham Young, 
Ten thousand miles away. 
They'll bow to every lady 
And they'll try and look their best ; 
They'll button up that linen duster 
To hide their old-time vest. 
They'll go in a 
bar-room, step up to the counter 
And drink when they know they can't pay ; 
tf the bartender murmurs " Please settle that round," 
.They'll wink their brunette eye and say--
CHORUS. 
By-and-by, by-and-by, they'll say 
Charge it," and then hurry to the door; 
" 
Drink with me, tra la la he.

Boston, Mass. 
DARLING, come back to my heart once again, 
Tell me my love for you is not in vain, 
Pledge me anew then the heart you once gave, 
Give me once more the love that I 
crave; 
Over our parting I've shed many tears, 
For love conquers pride in a 
conflict of years. 
All dreams of the past seem fruitless and vain— 
Darling, come back to iny heart once again, 
CHORUS. 
Darling, conic back to my heart once again, 
Tell me my love for you is not in vain; 
Happiness then forever will reign— 
Darling, conic back to my heart once again. 
Darling, come back to my heart once again. 
Let us bury the past with its sorrows and pain; 
Life's not worth living without you, my love— 
Your smile lights, my path like a 
star from above. 
Recall then the word that bade me depart, 
Forget but the love thou once bore in thy heart; 
Happiness then forever will reign— 
Darling. come back to my hoart onet•

JOHN MONAHAN'S DONKEY. 
sung by JAMES BRADLEY, at the Eagle Theatre, with great succen. 
I'vE got a 
donkey, he stands six foot high, 
I'll sell to the man that wishes to buy ; 
He drinks seltzer water whenever he's dry, 
In a 
run on the turf sure he never proved shy ; 
He makes good time, one mile a 
day, 
I'll match him against any stallion or bay ; 
He fought for his country, been all through the war, 
I 
feed him on herrings, hay, rope and tar.

And I 
had his monkey, 
And donkey also 7 
When he's locked in his stable he makes a 
stiff kick, 
lie wants to ;get out, he pretends he is sick ; 
I 
call out my donkey, his name it is Dick, 
I 
coax him along with a 
hickory stick ; 
If I 
leave in his box a 
big bale of hay, 
He'll eat it all up, leave none for next day ; 
Last week he broke loose and of course went astray, 
_He was found in a 
sewer in Avenue A.

ONLY A LITTLE PIN STUCK IN GRANDPA'S 
CHAIR, 
PARODY ON " ONLY_A VIOLET PLUCKED FROM MOTHER'S 
GRAVE ." 
Words by IRE BROWNE. 
SCENES of my childhood, and granddad's old arm- chair, 
rrom winch I've often seen him jump full six feet in the air, 
Then place his hand behind him with such a 
look I 
never saw, 
While from underneath his coat-tails a 
little pin he'd draw. 
Father and mother would then inquire for me, 
Sister and brother would girro-le, te, he, he; 
But while I 
take my gruel, to deprive me would be cruel, 
Of that little pin I 
stuck in grandpa's chair. 
CHORUS. 
Only a 
little pin I 
stuck in grandpa's chair, 
But Heavens! how he'd hump himself and h'ist me in the -air. 
He say, " You worst of all galoots," till my coat-tail full of 
boots, 
For that little pin I 
stuck in grandpa's chair. 
Ah! well T 
remember my granddad's cowhide shoe, 
With which he used to heist me, of times, all, not a 
few. 
Oh, how he'd swing them, and raise me in the air, 
And say, " Don't get discourae-ed, boy. I've got another pair." 
But now all is silent where I 
had my little fun, 
For I 
now have left him, he's nlven me the run; 
But while I 
eat my hash, you can never buy for cash 
That little pin I 
stuck in grandpa's chair. 
Only -a 
little pin, etc.

WHAT TALMAGE DID NOT SEE. 
As sung by TONY PASTOR, with great success 
AIR.--" Castles in the Air." 
Mu. Talmage late to New York came to see each wondrous 
sight, 
To find out if the world went wrong, and make the 
matter right ; 
He visited each curious place where " Life " did find a 
home, 
In fact he had a 
midnightspree as he this town did 
roam 
I 
did not wish much fault to find, of him to make com-
plaint, 
But think at home by his fireside would have been 
better for a " Saint !" 
No doubt he saw many things of the easy kind and free, 
But some misery he could help to cure he had not eyes 
to see. 
He did not see our working girls as the snow was falling 
fast., 
Creep home to attic, cramped and small, thro' the chilly 
wintry blast ; 
Her wretched home of poverty is roofless o'er her head, 
Her heart is bleak and cold and sad ! her meal a 
crust 
of bread. 
He did not see the twinkling stars shine down from the 
blue sky, 
Upon her upturned face of woe as she lay there to die; 
Heard not her suffering cry for " help !" as her 'soul from 
bondage free, 
Sped swiftly to the unknown shore I 
THAT Talmaga did 
not see. 
WHAT TALMAGE DID NOT SEE.—Uoncluded. 
He did not see our laboring men in life's sad battle beat, 
Working from daylight until dark that food their wives 
might eat ; 
He did not see dark hunger's cloud grow denser every 
day, 
Nor capital, with iron hand drag down each workman's 
pay ; 
He did hot see each savings bank, our poor hard evnings 
win, 
He went where luxury abounds in the halls of gilded 
sin ; 
The outcasts of the gutter he, in scorn did let them be, 
No hand he them reached out to save, such sights he 
did not see. 
I 
have often pondered in my mind, he had better go to 
work, 
And purify hi3 own good town before he tries New 
York; 
I never thought that Brooklyn was the long sought 
" 
promised laud," 
Or even that its 
parsons were the famous Gideon's 
Band. 
I 
hope before he next starts out in search of sin to roam, 
He'll use his purifying broom and sweep much nearer 
home; 
Or if he must keep on his course and will not let us be, 
He'll give a 
dime and not a 
tract when misery he does 
see.

COUGH, 
JOHN, 
COUGH, 
AND MAKE THE BABY 
LAUGH. 
As 
sung by NED Bay, with great success. 
You see that I'm a 
married man, at least I 
think you 
ought, 
By eighteen months of wedded bliss some trouble I've 
been taught, 
I'm father of a 
bouncing boy who's always wide awake; 
And I've to cough to keep it quiet until my jaws they 
ache. 
SPOKEN. — Yes, I'm the happy parent of a 
crying doll. 
I've bought rattles, India rubber tooth-rings, sugar-sticks, 
and everything else I

GREENHORN ON THE FLY. 
Isvised and sung by JOHNNY ROACH with great success. 
GOOD people all, take my advice, and listen unto me, 
But don't put too much confidence in every man you see. 
They say fine feathers make fine birds, but not so every 
one, 
For men will often wear broadcloth, to hide their little 
game, 
But whether they are fish or fowl it makes no difference 
to I, 
I 
know my business, you can bet, I'm a 
greenhorn on the 
There's Madame Morris from . Corsica, who with her tele-
scope, 
Your future wife or husband shows—good gracious ! that's 
a 
joke. 
If you give to her but fifty cents, she'll send you a 
card 
by mail, 
I 
think they ought to find her a 
home, six months in the 
county jaiL 
There's the seventh daughter of the seventh son, to swim 
die you they'll try, 
But I 
know their little euchre game, I'm a 
greenhorn on 
the fly. 
In Chatham street the other day I 
took a 
walk along, 
I 
heard a 
fellow crying out, going, going, gone. 
Who bids for it, this fine gold watch, the finest ever seen. 
They thought I 
was a.little flat—perhaps a 
little green— 
I 
says, excuse me, please, if I 
wink so with my eye, 
I 
know my business, you can bet I'm a 
greenhorn on the 
fly. 
There are fifty kinds of swindling-mills in the papers 
every day, 
And lotteries where you draw a 
farm (God knows how far 
away) ; 
The police say they searched very hard to find old Stew-
art's corpse, 
But I 
don't think they looked very far from the city of 
New York. 
If Judge Hilton had been wise, my friends, fifty thousand 
dollars he might have laid by, 
If he'd given that job to some one else, says the greenhorn

Music by H. DTMLET. 
My love was a 
dairyman dapper and smart. 
As straight, as a 
nail, 
quite won my heart, 
We vow d 
from each other we never should part, 
lgut how it resulted 1'11 tell. 
The housemaids and cooks to the windows all ran, 
When daily his rounds he would go. 
T6 catch a 
smail glimpse of t 
hat charming young man, 
As sweetly he cried, " Alin: below," 
CHORUS. 
He worked at a 
dairy and cried, " Milk below," 
In tones rich and slow, as l'0111111 he would go; 
I 
never iniagiii'd that he'd serve me so, 
• Nor dirt in that manner with we. 
But seldom it is that you find one so young, 
With such a 
smooth ton, ,ne the milkmen among, 
Then, when for my hand a 
consent he had wrung, 
I 
lent him %vino. money I'd saved. 
He said he intended no more to he " man," 
hot master himself he M 
mild be, 
And 'stead of he Ilel'fOrt h 
lig yoked to a 
can, 
lie hoped to be soon yoked to me. 
He work'd at a 
dairy, &a. 
Now when he became first acquainted with me, 
he'd nightly me see, brio.- cream for my tea; 
You'd t 
ink that a 
man who'd so generous be 
Would ne'er from lie word go away. 
I 
thought so myself mice, hut sorry am I, 
To have to record it of' him, 
He other girls treated ere three months went by, 
And ouly supplied me with " skim."

That he was a 
male flirt soon came to my ears, 
'I' was true, it appears, he called all girls " dears " 
So that 1 
should have a 
good ground for my tears, 
To watch lion I 
made up my mind. 
The length of his heat I 
soon alterwards found, 
For one day while walking his chalks, 
M R 
calls begait leaking as 11, , went his round. 
And thus he went chalking his walks, 
lie work'd at a 
dairy, & e. 
Each house that be called at there quite at his ease, 
The girls' hands he'd squeeze, which did them much please, 
That losing my temper 1 
was by degrees, 
And bade him to see me no more. 
Since that time I 
scorn all purveyors of milk, 
I 
Dever drink milk to my tea; 
I 
spurn all the whitewash of folks of that ilk, 
None of this " chalk•mixture " for into,

Price 40 cents. 
Is the attic you'll find it, with dust covered o'er, • 
That relic of grandma, you'll hear it no more; 
In the long, long ago she from care was released, 
And ever since then its music has ceased. 
As a 
child, how delighted, by her knee I 
would stand, 
As oft she caressed me with her by; hg hand; 
In the twilight of summer to her side I 
would steal, 
And gaze on iii wonder that old spinning wheel. 
CHORUS., 
Broken, at rest in the attic it stands, 
No inure responsive to the touch of her hands; 
It will no more the work of dear grandma reveal, 
She has left us to cherish that old spinning wheel. 
Oft the story I've heard dear grandma relate, 
Of war's cruel havoc, and grandpit's sad fate, 
Of her struggles thro' life, and her trials and cares, 
To keep her dear children from temptation's snares; 
But a 
friend she then found ever trusty and true, 
Ever ready to aid her in want safely through, 
And in thankfulness she every night time would kneel, 
And bless God for sending that old spinning wheel. 
Broken, at rest in the attic, etc. 
Not a 
room ' neath the roof can be made to reveal 
An object so dear us that, dim_ry old wheel, 
Long worn by the touch of a 
wrinkled old hand, 
Years since departed to a 
better land. 
In that kitchen so grand had it stood many years, 
Mute witness of .-ladness, of sorrow and tears, 
Of places made vacant by death's cruel seal, 
That time-honored relic, the old spinnin ,, wheel. 
Broken. at rest iii the attic, etc.

THE red, red rose that lovely grows, 
And blushes like a 
maiden, 
keeps nodding to the gentle breeze, 
With rosy perfume laden ; 
To greet a 
little tiny elf, 
For her my heart is yearning ; 
And lately I 
am scarce myself, 
My heart with love is blooming. 
CHORUS. 
Little Cherry Blosom, will you love me ? 
Little Cherry Blossom, will you wed me ? 
While the stars are twinkling in the silent deli 
Such a 
tale of love I'll tell thee ! 
Oh ! little Cherry Blossom, will you love me ? 
Little Cherry Blossom, will you wed me ? 
While the stars are twinkling in the silent dell 
Such a 
tale of love I'll tell thee ! 
The lily all proclaim so fair, 
She is the queen of flowers ; 
The rose, they say, conveys true love, 
'Mid Cupid's shining bowers ; 
The Pansie says, " forget.me not ! " 
The Laurel crowns with glory, 
The one that's fairer than the lot, 
The subject of my story, 
Little Cherry Blossom, etc. 
The dew upon the rose is like 
The tears that she is shedding, 
Impatient for a 
day to come, 
For soon there'll be a 
wedding ; 
And from life's garden I 
shall cull 
A 
fair and fragrant flower, 
And keep it blooming all my life, 
Within love's happy bower.

THE ROLLER SKATING RINK. 
Words and Music by I1E BROWNE. 
The music of this song is published by W. A. EvANs & Bno., 50 Brom-
field st:, Boston, Mass. 
Price 40 cents. 
Sensations now are all the rage, the latest agitating 
The public mind, is how to know the art of roller skating. 
People foiget they have a 
trade to earn their bread and butter, 
If you mention business, they of skates will only mutter. 
It is worse than epizootic, whooping cough Or bilious colic, 
This academic, epidemic, roller skating dude. 
If to a 
frhaid upon the street you say, " Come up my way," 
The chances are he'll turn about quite suddenly and say— 
CHORUS. 
I 
thank you, but then I 
think 
I'd prefer to go down to the rink. 
Where society belles and jolly young swells 
Are giving each other the wink ; 
Where the flirt and ,the •• masher king," 
And the dude, that queer little thing, 
Can he seen any time, for the sum of a 
dime, 
At the roller skating rink. 
The other eve, I 
went to call upon a 
darling creature, 
When there I 
met, to my surprise, that roller skating teacher. 
He'd been to call upon my girl, and they \yen?, just debating 
The question of a 
little whirl that night at roller skating. 
I 
sought no introduction, I 
was a 
trifle rude, 
For I 
hated tins conceited, brainless, roller skating dude. 
I 
asked my girl if she that night to the play would like to go, 
She blushed and smiled upon us both, but answered very low, 
I 
thank you, but then I 
think, etc. 
The moral of this business you can very plainly see, 
If you want to •‘ catch on " readily, a 
skater you must be; 
Among the girls you are N. G., and never 
trusted, 
Until you've given ample proof that all your hones are busted; 
And if the very pinnacle of fame you'd like to reach, 
Take my advice, and quickly learn in skating how to teach. 
Like a 
Magnet. you will surely draw, the girls to you will fly, 
To other invitations they will offt-r this reply— 
' 
thank you, but then I 
think, etc.

BOUQUET DOYLE. 
Written and sung by JAMES O'NEIL and JACK CONROY. 
I'm a 
masher among the shop girls, 
I 
carry on business down town, 
Every morning at eight I 
sit down to eat 
My coffee with doughnuts done brown. 
When I 
pass the girls at me they smile, 
For I 
dress in the latest of style ; 
Shure the boys on the street whenever we meet 
Say, how de you do, Bouquet .Doyle ? 
CHORUS. 
A 
Bouquet, a 
Bouquet I 
always do wear in my coat, 
The pink and white roses, the daisies and posies, 
With perfume I'm ready to choke. 
A 
Bouquet, a 
Bouquet to carry it is my delight, 
The sweet water lily, the daffydowndilly, 
I 
give to my gill every night. 
Shure I 
drink nothing stronger than milk, 
My necktie is the finest of silk, 
I 
attended every ball at Walla Hallo, Hall, 
Where the wine like water is spilt ; 
In the dairy, when I 
go to lunch, 
The girls get around in a 
bunch : 
They leave others there to serve me I 
declare, 
While a 
cranberry tart I 
do munch. 
A Bouquet, etc. 
I'm home every night about dawn, 
And I'm up with the lark in the morn 
Just before dark I 
walk thro' the park 
To feed all the spariows with corn. 
The Mayor of the city knows me, 
And with him I 
often do dine ; 
Whenever I 
meet a 
bum on the street 
He'll ask me if I 
have a 
dime. 
A 
Bouquet, etc.

PARODY ON " WAIT TILL THE CLOUDS ROLL BY."

CULLY, Illy Oid bum partner, 
I'm going far from thee, 
Down where for six months longer, 
Your pretty mug no more I'll see. 
Oh, how I'll miss your blossom. 
When for a 
drink I'd gladly die. 
Cully, take warning by toe then, 
And wait till the COp goes by. 
CHORUS. 
Wait till the cop goes by, Cully, 
Wait till the cop goes by; 
Before you freeze to a 
ticker not your own, love, 
Wait till the cop goes by. 
Cully, I 
know you'll send me 
Tobacker when I'm there; 
Send me the next " Police Gazette," love, 
With my biography and photo so fair. 
But now I 
must leave you, sweet \-iolet, 
See, on my wrists the " darbys" lie; 
Take a 
pointer from me when you prig, love, 
And wait till the cop goes by, 
Wait till the COp goes by, etc.

Like a

Witlt a

You might call him quite truly an ape; 
his eye was like that of a

In importance he rivalled the king of Hong Kong, 
This too utterly .mstitetic Dude.

He tackled all kinds of amusements in turn, 
To develop his muscle so weak, 
But he lacked the ambition to practice and learn, 
So be ventured upon a

He took up the banjo. and stuck to it well, 
His mind now with music ' mimed; 
ro the banjo alone the credit then fell 
For converting this Eccentric Dude.

THE DINNER BELLI. 
Parody on " The Water Mill." 
1y BaN COLLINS expressly for H ALEY and Wizse. 
LISTEN to the Dinner Bell; 
At 12 o'clock each day 
flow the boarders shout " Hurrah," 
To the dining room hurry away. 
The proprieter looks so pale and sick 
As they all sit down to eat, 
And though looking yet he cannot tell 
Which one his board will beat. 
Here, pass that " Union butter," 
One of them boarders said. 
If the mill can never grind 
We don't get any bread. 
What a 
hardened hungry lot 
These boarders seem to be, 
How they grasp and gormandise 
Most everything they see ; 
They were never known to stop, 
Unless they had their fill, 
Often coming back again 
To that corn-beef mill ; 
Truly speaks the landlord, 
" 
My clothes are fading fast; 
I 
cannot wash my Ulster 
It the water that has past.* 
( 
1 
1 
" 
Take this lesson to yourselves, 
But dok't take anything more; 
Pay your board, leave my house, 
Or I'll fire you out the door. 
You want your trunk, I 
want my money, 
I've trusted you enough; 
I 
know you well, you can't fool me, 
And say my turkey's tough; 
Go to the Black Hills and dig for Indiana; 
You may come back in silk; 
But the mill can never grind 
With the water that's in milk." 
Oh what waste in a 
boarding house, 
What bills you have to pay ; 
A 
dead-beat will conic back again, 
'Cause he " couldn't stay away." 
Some will ask for a 
fire escape, 
And more an elevator, 
And want their dollar diamond rings 
Put in the refrigerator. 
Take this lesson to your hearts 
Before you bring hi your trunk; 
The coffee mill can never grind 
When the cook is on a 
drunk.

" HERE IT IS." 
IIAN.TO 
CURIOSITIES. 
Suu,',-; 
by 1.1ARRY STANWOOD. 
FIRST TERSE. 
Otr, the times have grown very stiange, 
It's strange that it should be so; 
And we all go in for change, 
For change is all the go; 
" 
There's a 
change in the things that I 
loved," 
I 
loved a 
maiden tall, 
But she changed her love for a 
shiftless cove, 
One that had no change at all. 
For he spent all his change at a 
ball. 
SECOND STANZA. 
I 
went for to have some fun, 
And a 
skate on Central Park, 
But the cars got stuck in the snow, 
And they kept stuek there till dark; 
I 
started to walk down town, 
But I 
slipped and fell on my ear ; 
I 
frozed my toes and bunged my nose, 
And my eye-teeth ached with fear, 
And I 
won't get well in a 
year. 
THIRD ALTERATION. 
They've taken the bill boards down, 
For their board bills were too high; 
They can't live on the town, 
So they'll " pine" away and die ; 
Each leaned against his post, 
Till they all grew very lean, 
'Twas against their grain, but they didn't complain— 
They were old and weren't so green ; 
Oh! would that it wouldn't have been. 
FOURTH VASIFICATION. 
Oh ! I 
dreamed of my love last night. 
In the lane, when the clock struch nine ; 
With my rival I 
had a 
flak, 
And be knocked me out of time; 
A 
policeman heard the row, 
And I 
climbed on a 
lumber pile, 
But be knocked mc down and broke my crown. 
Because he said I 
was high ; 
When I 
woke it was all in my eye, 
(1) 
44 
"HERE IT IS."— Continued. 
FIFTH INTERLUDE. 
Oh! beautiful isle of the sea, 
d 
shall never see you more; 
'Twas a 
capital C 
to me ; 
The " ile" in the lamp on shore, 
But the ile has got so low, 
It don't give link any more, 
And the isle so bright has sunk out of sight, 
And the lamp did break on the shore, 
While the breakers loudly did roar. 
SIXTH AND LAST HYPERCOLU. 
" 
Mother, oh ! sine me to rest," 
The rest I'll forget to sing; 
" 
Little bird, fly to your nest," 
And let the old banjo ring— 
The ring had a 
diamond set, 
And shone as bright as a 
star ; 
My mother she sane " till the dim woods rang 
"Johnny's come home from the war," 
But I 
Dever was off's° far. 
SUSAN SMEARKASE. 
As sung by .11.un:y TAN WOOL'. 
I'm a 
broken-hearted foreigner, from Cheyenne I 
came, 
a 
watchmaker in a 
crowd, and Slim Jim is mv name ; 
I 
courted a 
maiden whose name was Sinearkase ; 
I 
asked her to have me—her reply it was, yea;;. 
cnoncs. 
She was beautiful as a 
catfish, her hair was sky blue, 
Was pretty little Susan Smearkase. 
Oh, how do you do I 
This maiden she had a 
gray-headed papa, 
4 $ 
Who would not accept me as his son-in-law ; 
And to make matters worse, the bald-headed galoot 
Busted his fist all over my snoot. 
She wa:; beautiful, etc. 
I 
had him arrested, but what was the use ? 
It only heaped on my head more abuse; 
The judge discharged him, but called ine-a beat, 
And gave me six months to work on the Nicho:son Favement 
in the street. 
She was beautiful, etc. 
When Susan heard I 
was anchored in j 
She swallowed a 
velocipede, run a 
foot in her na;1, 
Huila herself on a 
clothes- horse, and when last was seen, 
Was bathing her snoot in a 
glass of benzine. 
She was beautiful, etc.

SHE IS A LOVE. 
Written expressly for Manx STANWOOD, by BOBBY Nkvrcoms, and sung 
by him with great success. 
A 
LITTLE song I DOW Will sing, 
About a 
girl so fair, 
That I 
met walking out one day, 
She had such lovely hair ; 
She said she was an English blonde, 
Imported just, was she, 
And said, I 
was the style to suit 
She'd fell in love with me. 
CHORUS. 
My little love she is a 
dove, 
Just like an angel from above; 
The sweetest little charmer I 
ever did see, 
She don't love anybody else but me. 
She said she'd like to have ice cream, 
We walked in a 
saloon ; 
The waiter brought the frozen food, 
Which disappeared quite soon, 
When all at once she said to me, 
" 
It tastes quite cowey, truly," 
I 
said, " Oh, no, it is not so, 
To me it does taste 
My little love, etc. 
Now she had almond finger nails, 
Her eyes your heart they'd melt; 
As a 
pea- nut eater I 
am sure, 
My girl she'd wear the belt; 
And when I'd take her to a 
ball, 
Her feet the floor would hide ; 
So all the dancers that was there, 
Would have to stand outside. 
My little love, etc. 
She used to have the Grecian Bend, 
To make both ends meet she'd try ; 
And when she'd twist her head to dance, 
She'd make the shoe pegs fly. 
Ter hand was soft just like bread, 
her mouth curled to her ear ; 
ler back was crooked, 
Her waist looked like a 
keg of beer. 
My little love, etc.

TH E OLD CARPET SLIPPER . 
PARODY ON " THE OLD WOODEN ROCKER .", 
Words by IKE BROWNE. 
THERE stand in the cupboard, with the bottle of gin, 
Tie old carpet slippers, now threadbare and thin;

Witi that old carpet slipper I'll never forget. 
Oh, low often I've hid them in my boyish glee, 
To prolong the joy of riding' on dear papa's knee, 
And when they were found, oh how gayly—•‘ in a 
horn "— 
I'd actept papa's invite his lap to adorn. 
Then oi'd peel MI them slippers from his stockingless yams, 
And pay the tattoo on his boy's youthful hams, 
And Id sing to the music numberleSs chants, 
As hemerrily played on the bosom of my pants. 
As I

And we'll tell him how grandpapa. in days of yore, 
Used to swing that old slipper, and wallop us sore.

GET THEE GONE,

W ritten by NED Goss. 
Ant.—" Isle De Blackwell." 
On, a 
curious story I 
wish to relate, 
That happened way over in Michigan State ; 
It's of a 
young damiel I'll now tell to you, 
That lived with her parients in Kalamazoo. 
Of course they were wealthy, of money had much, 
Her father was Irish and her mother was Dutch. 
Whenever I'd call on her the old man would frowu 
SPOKEN. — A.11d. say : 
Get thee gone, man, get the gone, man, 
And you bet the man would get thee gone. 
Oh, this damsel was handsome, the fairest e'er seal, 
Her nose it was red, and her eyes they were green ; 
Her teeth they were freckled, she'd a 
wart on her air ; 
And then such a 
great mouth for Millwaukee beer. 
She'd a 
hump on her back like a 
big eam-mi-mile, 
She was cross-eyed in both feet, to see her you'd smie. 
Whene'er I'd call on her the old man would shout out, 
Get, thee out, man, ,g-et thee out, man, 
And you bet the man would get thee out.

Oh, say I'll await in the " gin mill" 
Till I'm slew'd and laid out on the floor. 
Little Robin, tell Kittle I'm bumming, 
I'm paralyzed nearly, I

What a 
feeling! not new, but so queer. 
On the top of that last glass of whiskey

But a " bum " who stood by said ' twas risks' 
For one ' twas so near " on his ear."

McGINNISS. 
Written by H ARDY BENNETT. 
A YOUNG man to this city came, 
In walking he was slightly game, 
Patricius was his maiden name— 
McGinnim. 
The boys they used to call him gimps, 
As on the street he'd slowly limp, 
They sold him Croton bugs for shrimp— 
MeGinniss. 
Taking a 
kind friend's good advice. 
He went and got a 
job so nice, 
in the undertaker's, cracking ice— 
McGinniss. 
At first the times were rather rough, 
But now he's doing well enough, 
For he can stand them—he is tough— 
MeGinniss. 
Long live that good young man, say I, 
And when time comes for him to die, 
Free lunches one and all will cry— 
McGinniss. 
YOUR FACE WOULD STOP A ' CLOCK. 
As sung by JOHN KERNELL. 
I AM a 
man that had lots of trouble, 
But you heard that before ; 
I 
am known all around town 
And on Jersey's distant shore ; 
I 
never meddled in politics, 
Or worked around the dock, 
But the boys all say as: they pass my way, 
" 
Your face would stop a 
clock." 
cnouus. 
I 
spend my money free, my boys, 
I 
am solid as a 
rock ; 
But the girls all say as they pass my way, 
" 
Your face would stop a 
clock." 
-I 
went down the other day 
Along with a 
friend of mine, 
When a 
little boy with a 
box on his back 
Says, " Terrier, do yon want, a 
shine ?" 
I 
hit him on the head with my umbrella, 
But he soon recovered from the shock, 
And jumping up quick he yelled out laud, 
" 
Your face would stop a 
clock." 
I 
spend D1S money, eta.

GRANDMOTHER'S BIG HEART, 
Am.—"GrandmothEr's Old Arm Chair," by WM. akRROLL. 
My grandmother she at the age of twenty-three 
Was found sitting on my grandfather's clock ; 
Her hair was silvery rod, and she never slept in bed, 
And done washing for the babies in our block. 
She never wore the pants, but was good to all the 
tramps, 
And her heart is big as any paving stone. 
When she cashed in her checks they could not find her 
specs, 
And she left me her brother's old trombone. 
CHORUS. 
How 
hollered, how I 
swore— 
My last winter's ulste,.. into rags I 
tore ; 
When the police put me in jail 
There was no one in the city who'd go my bail. 
My cousin who's away got a 
bale of salt-marsh hay, 
But he gave it to a 
man who is not born, 
And poor old Uncle Dan received a 
Cincinnati ham, 
With a 
cross-grained paralytic ear of corn ; 
And there was old Aunt Sallie who lives in our dark 
She got a 
yard of second- handed lace, 
And then my brother Ed got a 
loaf of inome-made bread, 
Who was never known to wash his dirty face. 
CHORUS. 
Oh such kicking, such a 
time, 
With my sister's husband singing " Baby mine 
Around his neck I'd like to tie a 
rock, 
And smash him in the 
necktie with my grand-
mother's sock.

YOU GIT ! 
As 
sung by CI:ILIUM and LEWIS DOCKSTADEL 
SEE was very smart an' she owned a 
cart, 
Her maiden name was Pat; 
'Deed, she owned a 
mule an' she went to school, 
She was dumpy, short an' fat. 
Oh, her given name was Jane, 
it was a 
shame, but she was lame, 
She was a 
brakeman on a 
cattle train, 
And her parents all lived in Fort Wayne. 
Oh, I 
asked her for a 
kiss, a 
little kiss, 
And she told me this : 
She whispered like an angel, " Yon travel— 
Now—umph—phist---you git !" 
Oh ! I 
won her heart, we sold de cart, 
An' we gave away de mule; 
Well, she hemmed and hawed, she cried an' jawed, 
And she said I 
was a 
fool ; 
She owned a 
dog that was full of fleas, 
An' on my knees I 
used to tease. 
Seven long years I 
coaxed her to marry, 
But I 
ne'er could her please. 
She would laugh, but she wouldn't cry, 
Wish I 
may die ! well, I 
wouldn't lie— 
Oh 1 
she whispered, " Skip the gutter, young fellow! 
Now—umph—phist—you git !"

DON'T BLAME ME FOR I 
DIDN'T DO IT. 
COMIC SONG AND CHORUS. 
Written, composed and sung by CHAS. H . 
DUNCAN. 
Published in sheet music by it. A. SAALFIELD, 839 Broadway, N. Y, 
Salm time ago, as you must know, 
I 
met a 
charming girl, 
She looked so very pretty 
That my brain got in a 
whirl. 
She wore a 
small shell bonnet, 
That became her well indeed, 
But when she slipped down upon the ice, 
My heart for her did bleed. 
CHORUS. 
Don't blame me for I 
didn't do it, 
Don't blame me for I 
didn't do it, 
Don't blame me for I 
didn't do it, 
I 
am not to blame. 
(
Repeat.) 
She begged that I'd excuse her, 
Which of course I 
quickly done, 
She handed me a 
scented card, 
The charmer I 
had won; 
She stated that her father was 
A 
very peculiar man, 
Was training for a 
prize fight, 
And his name was Reckless Dan. 
Don't blame me, etc. 
I 
stuck to her just like a 
leech, 
We're married most a 
year, 
On good terms with her father, 
And have nothing now to fear. 
We've got a 
baby, it's a 
girl, 
She is her mother's joy, 
But I'm not fond of girls at all— 
I'd rather have a 
boy. 
Don't blame- me, etc.

CHICKENS IN THE GARDEN. 
As sung by Joni,/ 
W ILSON with great success. 
I 
exert did know a 
farmer, a 
good old jolly soul, 
Who used to work upon the farm around his country 
home ; 
had an only daughter, and to win her I 
did try, 
And when I 
asked him for her hand these words he did 
reply : 
CHORUS. 
Treat my daughter kindly, and say you'll do no harm, 
And when I 
die I'll leave to you my little house and farm, 
My horse, my plow, my sheep, my cow, my hogs, and 
little barn, 
And all those little chickens in the garden. 
I 
own I 
love this darling girl, and dearly she loves me, 
I 
used to go around her home her smiling lace to see ; 
To watch her milk her father's ducks and admire her 
every charm. 
And many a 
drink of milk I 
got before I 
left the barn. 
SPoKEN.—Yes, and the old man would join our hands 
together, putting one of his own on each of our heads, 
he would say, God bless you, little children, and young 
man, remember, I'll break your back if you don't always— 
Treat my daughter, etc. 
Now the old man has consented, and married we will be.

And I'll strive to keep the promise that the old man asked

NEVER GO BACK ON A FELLOW . 
Written by M. J. WILTON, 
W HEN you meet with a 
friend on the avenue, 
Don't turn your head over that way, 
As if you're afraid that the ladies (God bless them.) 
Would turn up their noses this way ; (
imitates.) 
But welcome your friend with a 
welcome 
That's born of the heart, warm and true; 
God's blessing will surely attend you, 
And bless everything that you do. 
CHORUS. 
Then never go back on a 
fellow, 
E'en though his garments be plain ; 
He's better, a 
thousand times better, 
Than the man who looks only to gain. 
There may be times when one may need 
The assistance of a 
friend. 
A. man to be a 
friend indeed, 
But not to scrape or bend. 
"Fis said woman's heart is a 
riddle, 
One which you never can read; 
But then, in the hour of trial 
She proves herself friendly indeed. 
Then never go back, etc. 
Perhaps you may think yourself better 
Than lie who is dressed not so trim; 
His ulster may hide rusty garments, 
But it covers a 
warm heart within. 
Could you look to, the lwat t 
of your neiAbor 
You would see what is manly and true; 
A 
heart which is full of affection 
For others,—for me, and for you. 
Then never go back, etc. 
Have we not all been created as brothers, 
To help one another in need, 
To hear with one's whims and caprices, 
And prove ourselves friendly indeed ? 
The best and the noblest may sometimes 
Be cast down by sorrow or pain; 
Let yours be the hand that would raise him, 
And restore him his mrinhood again. 
Then never go back, etc.

ANNA MARIA CAIPOOSELAM JANE. 
BANJO SOLO. 
Sung by TOM W AIIPIELD. 
I'VE nearly cried my eyes all out, 
My clothes are getting thinner, 
I'll be bald-headed yery soon 
Through a 
girl, I 
couldn't win her. 
I 
bought a 
brand new set of teeth 
To chew gum- drops through the day, 
And when she euehered all my stamps, 
Why, from me she ran away. 
enonus. 
Anna Maria Cafooselam Jane, 
That is my darling's name ; 
And all the fellows in this town 
Have got her on the brain. 
She's humpbacked, bunion on her to*, 
And a 
double-breasted corn, 
'Where is my Anna Maria gone? 
The fellow she pawned her gizzard to 
Was an artiste in his line; 
He was by trade a 
catcher of dogs, 
And he got rich in the Summer time. 
He presented her with a 
poodle purp. 
Her old heart to ensnare; 
He bought her bad butter for pomade, 
And a 
barrel of red false hair. 
Anna Maria, etc. 
I 
thought at once I 
would die ( my hair), 
Or do a 
deed quite rash; 
So I 
rushed right down to my boa.rdiug-house, 
And I 
poisoned myself with hash. 
I 
threw myself in a 
fellow's pocket, 
And borrowed his watch-
that's funny; 
While the girl she came to a 
terrible end 
By eating brown soap for honey. 
Anne Maria, etc
