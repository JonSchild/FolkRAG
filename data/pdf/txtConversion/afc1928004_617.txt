PAT ROONEY'S greatest hit. 
Copyright Secured, 1881. 
My name is Muldoon, from Roscommon, 
- 
But I 
go by the title of Dan; 
a 
brother to that famous hero 
That's known as the great solid man. 
The blackguards they have me tormented, 
With a 
new slang they use in their throat, 
They shout and they bawl, as I 
pass City Hall, 
That's Muldoon with his new ulster coat. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, they shout and they bawl, as I 
pass City Hall, 
Pipe the terrier with his new ulster coat. 
Last week I 
went to the circus, 
Along with my old lady, too, 
I 
hired two seats near the actors, 
In order to get a 
full view. 
When a 
laddybuck came out dressed in ribbons, 
When he lepped in the ring like a 
cat, 
And he shouted out loud, forninst the whole crowd, 
,That's Muldoon with his St. Patrick's Day hat. 
CHORUS. 
And he shouted out loud, forninst the whole crowd, 
That's Muldoon with his St. Patrick's Day hat.

And made all the country's laws.

I'll make all the girls and women wear pants, 
There'll be no kid gloves on their hand; 
The Republicans will run the Irish 
When I am king of Ireland.

VII move the White House over to Cork; 
Have telegraph wires running to Heaven, 
Build an awning over New York.

I'll send Hayes and Sherman exploring fogs 
And make aldermen out of Chisese. 
I'll make the girls, etc.

Oh, come, my darling, ' tis just the hour,

MY DAUGHTER JOHANNA MeNALLY. 
Written by JAMES Ricrimorrn. 
As sung by PAT noornir. 
Copyrighted 1880, by the Nvw York Popular Publishing Oo. 
My daughter Johanna plays on the piano, 
She is only sixteen years of age; 
She does jigs, and reels, and comic songs, 
And imitates me on the stage. 
Her head is bald with education, 
She gets three hundred a 
night in the bally, 
She is an Irish blonde and catches the guys, 
She is my daughter Johanna McNally. 
CHoitus. 
She is purty, oh, ain't she nice, 
(Break) 
Fresher than a 
ton of salt or ice 
She bought three brown-stone fronts last week, 
But she'd rather live quiet in the alley, 
She broke McCullough's heart when she played Juliet, 
She is my daughter Johanna McNally. 
Mary Anderson asked her to double Up, 
She said she had a 
better chance 
Doing a 
double clog with Edwin Booth, 
And a 
sensational song and dance. 
The Prince of Wales got stuck on her, 
He threw diamonds at her in the bally; 
But she'll be an old maid, of marriage she is afraid, 
She is my daughter Johanna McNally. 
She is runty, etc.

WHY DON'T YOU CRACK IT LIGHT. 
Writt,11 and composed by R. J. PtGorr, and respectfully dedi-
cated to M R. PAT ROONEY, Irish Comedian. 
You see before you now, a 
man, 
Whose heart is filled with woe; 
The people laugh and hoot at me, 
No matter where I 
go. 
I 
never trouble any one, 
But try to do what's right, 
When through the streets I 
pass, they say-
-Why don't you crack it light. 
I 
have steady work throughout the year, 
And am well satisfied; 
I've got the best of little wives, 
And faith she is my pride. 
I 
always find her hard at work, 
When I 
come home at night; 
But still she very often says— 
Why don't you crack it light. 
Last night while coming home from work 
I 
meta friend named Flynn, 
We met just by a 
liquor store, 
And he and I 
went in. 
We drank, and drank. did Flynn and I, 
'Till we got awful tight. 
And then the owner put us out, 
And said 
Say crack it light.'

'THE APOLOGY TO O'REILLY. 
Not a 
hundred yards from where I 
stand, 
In this our glorious Union land, 
Is kept -a 
first-class liquor stand 
By a 
man whose name's O'Connor. 
There's a 
man who's known both near and far, 
Who attends to Mike O'Connor's bar; 
Who, in our late war, received no scar, 
And his name it is O'Reilly. 
Beneath our banner's starry wave, 
There's not a 
man fought half so brave, 
Or half the money for whisky gave, 
As did McDermott. 
O'Connor's bar-room blazed with light 
On that eventful., bloody night 
That McDermott had the fearful fight 
With O'Reilly. 
With sleeves rolled up McDermott stood, 
And vowed he'd die before he would 
- 
Say the slightest word that could, 
In any manner, be misconstrued 
Into an apology to O'Reilly. 
With a 
frowning brow and flashing eye, 
O'Reilly collared a 
glass of rye, 
Which he devoured without a 
sigh, 
Then turning to McDermott, said, - 
" 
You alcoholic vat, you drunken loon!, 
You've no more sense than a 
gossoon!" 
" 
Be Heavens? I'll make you change your tune,", 
Bays McDermott. • 
McDermott went for O'Reilly's nose, 
And on it planted fearful blows, 
Till o'er his eye a 
shanty rose, 
Erected by McDermott. 
O'Reilly fell into a 
swoon, 
With his head jammed in a 
big spittoon, 
And dreaming of Barnum's big balloon, 
-The police mune in and collared the gang.

ARE YOU GOING PAR? ONLY TO THE CAR. 
Copyright Secured 1:•:1, 
As sung by America's own Vocalist, Toary PASTOR. 
Strolling out the other evening, 
Such a 
fairy girl I 
met, 
Eyes so bright with love-light gleaming, 
Her first glance I'll ne'er forget. 
Softly I 
addressed the maiden— 
In her face my fate I 
read— 
" 
Tell me, sweet one, whe're you're going 
•
4 Just to meet my pa," she said. 
CHORUS. 
"Are you going far?" " Not too far, 
Only to the car just to see pa, ta-ta." 
In a 
pleasant way we chatted, 
I 
asked leave to call next day, 
She of course felt highly flattered 
To be courted in that way. 
To her ma she introduced me, 
Then my way was smooth and clear, 
There was nothing she refused me, 
When I 
whispered in her ear. 
SPOKEN. — Yes, she was very obliging; she was 
kindness itself; she would do almost anything for 
me. 
Why, one day, as we were passing Dehnonico's, 
I 
asked her to come in, and, do you know, she con-
sented without a 
murmur. 
Her mother, too, is a 
real 
nice old lady. 
Whenever Blanche and I 
are going 
out for a 
walk, she will say— 
Are you going far, etc. 
But one day we met her father, 
Then there was an awful row; 
Was he angry? Well, yes, rather, 
Such a 
frown upon his brow; 
" 
Who are you, sir, with my daughter?" 
'T was a 
voice like thunder's roar. 
"Don't you know me, sir? You'd ought to, . 
l'm a 
swell called Theodore." 
SPOKEN. — It was quite a task to make an impres-
sion on the old gentleman, but I 
finally succeededzin 
convincing him that it was perfectly right and proper 
for Blanche and I 
to say to one another— 
Are you going far, etc.

AN IRISHMAN'S TOAST. 
As sung with great success by TONY PASTOR. 
Don't call me weak-minded, perchance I 
should sing 
Of the dearest ohl spot upon earth, 
And don't think me foolish should memory bring 
To my mind the dear land of my birth, 
With its hills and its valleys, its mountains and vales 
Of which our forefathers would boast, 
Of a 
dear little island all covered with green, 
Ah, but list' and Fit give you an Irishman's toast. 
CHORUS. 
Here's to the land of the shamrock so green, 
Here's to ea,ch boy and his darling colleen, 
Here's to the ones we love dearest and most, 
May God speed old Ireland, that's an Irishman's toast. 
My mind's eye oft pictures my old cabin home, 
Where it stood by the murmuring rill, 
Where my playmates and I 
oft together did roam 
Through the castle that stood on the hill; 
But the stout hand of time has destroyed the old cot, 
And the farm now lies barren and bare; 
Around the old porch there is ivy entwined, 
But the birds seem to warble this toast in the air. 
Here's to the land, etc. 
The church and the schoolhouse have long been 
replaced; 
In the Harp Hotel dwells a 
new host, 
The white-haired old veteran has long been at rest, 
And his wife has deserted her post; 
King Death, the stern reaper, has called them away, 
And their children have gone o'er the seas, 
There is nothing but strangers around the old spot, 
Still this toast seems to waft to my 
ears on the breeze. 
Here's to the land, eta.

AS SOLID AS MULDOON. 
- 
Written by Dzcit Mica, and sung with great SLIMES'S by FgRIIMON & 
MACK. 
We just come out before ye now, 
To tell you one and all, 
The troubles we had in Parliament 
With politics last fall; 
The people would 'cheer after ug, 
And talk about our clan, 
For they all know we are as tricky 
As Muldoon, the solid man. 
CHORUS. 
Our edacation is great, 
Respected by every man, 
They all know we are too fresh 
To be Muldoon, the solid man, 
We sat in Parliament for years.' 
And showed them all a 
trick; 
We'd talk for hours and not sit down 
Till persuaded by a 
brick. 
As we go into a 
liquor store 
They all do fill their can, 
And drink success to the hero 
Muldoon, the solid man.

Copyright, 1675, by E. H. HARDING. 
McGee was a 
jolly old cobbler, 
He came from the divil knows where; 
Of whiskey he was a 
great gobbler. 
And delighted to go on a " tare." 
Be was often persuaded to alter 
His habits, and live like a 
man; 
But whenever he tried he would falter. 
And go back to his bottle and can. 
CHORUS. 
McGee was a 
terrible man, 
He was always so flighty and frisky; 
Be tried to reform, but he couldn't keep warm, 
Sure, he'd die if he hadn't his whiskey. 
His wife was a 
dacent ould woman, 
And scolded from mornin' tin night; 
She told him he must be inhuman, 
To be keeping them in such a 
plight. 
Be would listen in scorn and derision, 
And drink just as much as before; 
Till at length she gave out her decision 
To begin on a 
temperance war. 
McGee was, etc 
She went to a 
temperance preacher • 
And stated the case of McGee; 
Be iooromised to help the poor creature— 
" 
I'll go over next mornin'," says he. 
When he came, the old cobbler was roaring 
A. song, with his glass in his hand; 
'Twits the glass he was fond of adoring, 
And he seemed hardly able to stand! 
McGee was, ett. 
" 
Dear Misther McGee," said his rev'rence. 
"I hope you will alter your ways; 
I've come now to give you deliverance 
From the evil that's blighthag your days!"

Youll show us how gopd you can be; 
The demon of drink we will slaughter, 
And we'll hondr the name of McGee." 
Then he promised to keep at a 
distance 
All drinks of whatever degree; 
" 
Noble mark you shall have our assistance. 
In a 
week the result you shall see." 
Seokatt.:—The reverend gentleman, after some further persuasions, 
took his departure, and Mr. McGee at once became a 
strict disciple 
rf temperance. The sudden change of life had a 
severe effect upon 
Itim; be lost all his exuberant spirits, being entirely under the con. 
trol of his wife and the tempesance advocates, who filled his mind 
every day with solemn lectures, and worked him into such a 
queer 
staW—half comfort, half despair—that he would often say to him-
self, " Begob, I'm not meself at all!" 
At last they induced him to 
state in a public meeting the various benefits he had derived from 
his adherence to the pledge—the comfort, the happi-tels, the great 
joy and peace of mind he had experienced during his shoPt season of 
sobriety. He attended the meeting, and with a 
very gray% ctstatten-
anCe. related his experience, as follows: 
RECITATION. 
Good people, I 
stand here before you to-night, 
Me mouth very dhry, and my heed very light; 
It's three weeks to-day since I 
joined in the ranks 
Of the Wather Brigade, I 
left off me ould pranks! 
And ever since then, sure, my life has been blessed 
With a 
great many comforts and nights of good rest. 
I 
paid all me debts, and I 
bought-a 
new gown 
For the wife of me bosom—a 
beautiful brown— 
I 
took from the pawn shop my foin Sunday coat, 
Which cost me last winter a 
ten-dollar note, 
And put a 
new sole on the ould woman's shoes— 
A 
moighty big job, for she wears " twinty-two's!" 
. 
I 
made a 
new sty for the fine little pigs,. 
And fixed up the garden with bushes and twigs;

BRIDGET, 
GET THE SUPPER. 
Wrftten by W ILLIAM Sa.min for JOHNNY -K=1MM 
Ohl I 
have a wife and d&ughter whom I 
most dearly 
love, 
No king or duke is happier than me; 
When I 
sit down to my meals what happiness to be 
With my little family! 
My daughter she's a 
scholar, she can read, write and 
spell, 
She is the smartest girl I 
ever did see, 
And to hen I 
am.kind, for her father she does mind, 
But to my wife I 
often have to say— 
CHORUS. 
"Bridget, get the supper, 
Lord knows I'm nearly starved; 
Bridget, get it, do, my dear, 
I 
have been working hard 
All day, on the bed I 
want to lay, 
So, Bridget, get the supper, do, my dear." 
Across the street from where we live a lady keeps a 
store, 
That's where all our groceries we do buy; 
Her name is Mrs. Quinn, she was never known to sin, 
She is honest, and on that you may rely; 
She is loved by all the neighbors that live about the 
ward, 
She is known both near and far away; 
Sometimes when I 
go home, to her house I 
have to 
roam, 
And to my wife I 
have to say— 
Bridget, etc.

EMPTY Is THE DOG-HOUSE; TOWER'S POI— 
SONED. 
Sung by Woonsos & ALLEN'S Minstrels. 
Once I 
had a yellow dog, his name was Towser Jen-
kins, 
A 
butcher cut his tail off with his cleaver; 
Towser had his trade-mar k 
on every cat in town, 
And when he tackled one he'd never leave 'er. 
His nose was full of blisters, where the cats chewed 
off his whiskers, 
But empty is the dog-house where we ties him, 
A 
policeman spotted Towser, put some arsenic in his 
grub, 
Empty is the dog-house, Towser's p'isoned. 
CHORUS. 
He's gone to hunt for rats in the happy hunting-
ground, 
He died this morning as the sun was risin'; 
The fleas have all turned out for to find a 
new lunch 
route, 
Empty is the dog-house, Towser's p'isoned. 
How 
that dog would grin when he would see a 
tramp, 
He used to put bay-windows in their breeches; 
His legs were worn off stumpy, chasing milk carte 
round the country, 
He had bunions on his knees from jumpin' ditches. 
He'd corns upon his ribs chasin' rats around corn-
cribs. 
And when he'd catch 'em how he'd paralyze ' em • 
I 
But he got up and dusted when his chest- pro tector 
busted, 
Empty is the dog-house, Towser's p'isoned. 
CHORUS. 
He's gone to hunt for liver, way up the Swaney 
River, 
His muzzle and his collar are in pawn; 
The p'ison made him sad, and he eat his liver-pad, j 
Empty is the dog-house, Towser's p'isoued.

In her famous boarding-house,

As quiet as a

And her daughter Rose, so cute,

Upon my sweet-toned flute. 
CHORUS. 
Tootle-e-toote, I

So lively and so gay, 
I 
charm the neighbors all around, 
And pass the time away. 
My tootle-e-toote so sweetly played, 
Would charm the savage Ute; 
The boarders are enchanted quite 
With Finnegan and his flute. 
I 
play for aociability 
At every private ball, 
And all the elegant ladies 
Invite me on them call. 
I

So quiet and so cute, 
The ladies all in love do fall 
With Finnegan and his flute.

GIVE THE WORKING MAN A CHANCE. 
Some boast of wealth and riches, but give me the 
hardy hand, 
Give me the honest workingman, the pride of every 
land. 
Tht man that earns his living by the sweat of labor's 
brew, 
That wields the axe, the pick, the spaoe, or stands 
behing the plough. 
I 
love the sons of manly toil, they built up our success, 
And made a 
mighty nation of this western wilderness; 
Unto our bright protecting stars they nobly did 
advance, 
For well they knew our flag would give each working-
man a, chance. 
They spanned the mighty prairie, they enriched the 
American soil, 
They built each railroad in the land, these sons of 
hardy toil: 
In vain did other climes ' compete, our vessels swept 
the sea, 
For labor was our bond of strength, bright labor, 
strong and free. 
I 
envy not the titled lord, nor yet the man of wealth, 
I'd rather have the sinews strong, that tinge of ruddy 
health, 
That labor gives to all her sons whose watchword is. 
ad vance, 
What made our great success—we gave our working. 
than a 
chance. 
(Continued.) 
Let England send her hardy sons, to them we'll give 
the hand, 
We can't forget that Washington sprung from the 
motherland, 
Let Germany her thousands send, to leave their 
sunny Rhine, 
And Russia, from her icy plains, in countless thousandp 
join, 
Let Ireland send each manly form, no tyrant here 
does stand, 
A welcome sweet we'll give to 
all in our bright 
Western land, 
Come from the home of Lafayette— the sunlit hills of 
France, 
For ' tis our greatest joy to give each workingman a 
chance. 
OFF FOR GEORGIA. 
Way down in Georgia, upon the old plantation, 
There's where to live to be happy, light and free; 
And when our work was over, we had a 
new variation, 
And with the nigger wenches we had a 
jubilee. 
CnoRus. 
Off for Georgia, so early in the morning; 
Off for Georgia before the break of day. 
Give our respects to all the pretty yaller gals, 
For we're off for Georgia before the break of day. 
Way down in Georgia, upon the old plantation; 
Oh, how quick the day did pass, so happy, light and 
free, 
I 
wish that we were back again, and at our old vocar

Dancing on the green, by the double rule of three.

GOD HELP THE SUFFERING OF IRELAND!) 
By 
DEN.Nrs F. 
MURPHY.' 
Olit kind and sympathetic friends, a 
word to you rn say 
Of poor old suffering Ireland, so far across the sea. 
Pity the poor afflicted ones, crying for want of bread, 
And the weak and hungry mother, with her only child laid 
dead. 
Without the means to bury it makes the widow's grief much 
more; 
While praying to God to send relief, or some friend to her 
door, 
She sinks from starving weakness, and as the hours go fleet-
ing by, 
Alas! it seems there's no one to heed her dying cry. 
The famine now is raging, it flies to every door, \ 
God in his holy mercy, look down upon the poor. 
They hold their hands up pleadingly, and pitiful they cry, \ 
To give to them our charity, alas, before they die. 
But hark! What news is flashed across the cable of the deep, 
Cheering hope with the early dawn does peep, 
And the papers of the morning cry through the cold chill air, 
Money and provisions from America so fair. 
Yes, the hearts of true America, who never yet have laird 
To help the poor distressing ones crying with hunger's wail, 
And who so nobly acts her part in all she acts so well, 
And what country's deeds no matter where can that of ours 
excel? 
We love to help humanity, and relieve it from its throbs, 
And despise those who the sweets of life from his neighbor 
robs. 
We hate the grabbing landlords, persecutors, too, as well, 
, 
Who, to fill their own fat purse, the poor man's ,soul would 
sell. 
The noble gift of Bennett, caused the hearts of all to thrill, 
And with feelings of emotion, our eyes with tears did fill. 
We come gladly to the rescue with what we have to spare, 
And help to raise the weak and sick from poverty's scanty 
fare. 
Nor will we cease to lend our aid, nor hear the sufferers call, 
Until we find that want is gone, and relief has come to all. 
And then well raise our hearts in thanks, and this will be our 
prayer, 
That Ireland in the future, better than the past may fare.

A 
girl will not marry a 
man she don't want, 
I'll bet you two dollars she won't; 
A 
loafer she does not desire for a 
mate, 
I'll bet you two dollars she.don't; 
Por her choice she will have, if the old man declares., 
That her judgment is stupid and blunt, 
And her mother insists she shall have one she don't 
want, 
I'll bet you two dollars she won't. 
Sometimes she'll declare, snap her eyes. pull her hair, 
For her equal you'd long have to hunt; 
Coax her gently and easily, but don't try to drive her 
I'll bet you two dollars she don't. 
A. strong minded mother-in-law will never consent, 
I'll bet you two dollars she don't, 
To her son-in-law spending an extra red cent, 
I"11 bet you two dollars she won't. 
All married men fOols know the mother-in-law rules, 
And I'll tell it to young men that don't, 
When married girls say, 
drive her away," 
I'll bet you two dollars you don't. 
To yourself you must say, how I 
long for the day, 
That my mother-in-law's spirit up will float, 
But when the time comes and you think she will go, 
I'll bet you two doliars she don't.

Old man with young wife people call her a 
fool, 
I'll bet you two dollars he don't; 
Folks think she has married the old man for his dust, 
I'll bet you two dollars he don't. 
Old men with great means feel like boys in their teens 
And with money they can have what they want, 
But without that great gem no girl would want them, 
I'll bet you two dollars they don't. 
Old maids, too, are sad, and some awfully mad, 
But they'll never tell, no, they won't. 
When leap year has passed for a husband tUey've

He bets them two dollars he won't. 
No married man wants to dispute with his wife,

She's bound to be boss, still he thinks he can win,

With the broom stick he gets a

And ne'er touch his side; 
He's too short for my cart, 
And as black as a

I'll take him apart some day 
Just for a 
joke.

And go get him stuffed, 
For he is no good, 
For he's lived long enough; 
I'll take out his teeth 
To give to my girl, 
I'll cut off his tail 
And preserve it in oiL 
I'll take out his eyes,

At Hibernia Hall.

Died of the whooping cough.

Well, they tackled a

And this is what they had: 
Johnny Maloney, chewed boloney, 
And his brother chewed pig's feet, 
His sister chewed corned beef and cabbage, 
And the old man eat hash meat, meat—meat--meat, 
All alone on a 
big ham bone, 
They pulverized so neat, 
Then the young fellows gave them a 
five dollar note, 
To go work another street.

They called and called and called for more, 
Most anything they'd chew: 
The beans they made a 
terrible hit, 
They took four encores on a

They eat until they all fell dead, 
Then the coronor's jury sat, 
And the verdict of the Maloneys' death, 
Was that they died from total starvation.

KITTY MULDOON. 
By P. J. Fox, 
flay the heavens shine down on ye, Kitty Muldoon, 
With yer bright laughin' eyes, so bewitehinly blue; 
But take care that ye don't he the death of me soon, 
If ye taze me much longer the way that ye do. 
My heart's daily growin' more hopeless an' sore, 
An' there's no use in goin' to bed any more; 
For I'm all the time thinkin' about ye like mad, 
An' I 
sit at the window an' gaze at the moon; 
An' unless ye do somethin' to cure me, bedad, 
Ye will soon be the death of me, Kitty Muldoon. 
My own darlin' Kitty, my golden- haired Kitty, 
My beautiful, dutiful Kitty Muldoon. 
Last Sathurday night, comin' home from the store, 
I 
fell in a 
doldhrum an' wandher'd asthray; 
Till a 
feelin' came o'er me while passin' yer door, 
That tould me how far I 
was out of my way. 
Says I, " Ins a 
pity for me to come here, 
If I 
can't see my Kitty, an' Kitty so near." 
So I 
peeped through the shutters and what did I 
see 
But a 
chap they nail Barney O'Dowd from Rath-
coon, 
An' a 
eharmin' young girl on his impudent knee, 
Who was just the born piethur of Kitty Muldoon! 
My own darlin' Kitty, my golden-haired Kitty, 
My beautiful, dutiful Kitty Muldoon. 
The ev'nin' we sat in the kitchen last week, 
I 
was just goin' to ask ye to tell me my fate; 
But my heart was so full that my tongue wouldn't 
speak, 
So I 
had to suppress my intentions an' wait; 
An' now I 
am mopin' in grief an' disthress, 
But I'm all the time hopin' ye'll one day say " 
An', begorra, if iver ye dared to say " No," 
It's on thrial for murdher ye'd find yerself soon, 
For a 
ton weight of lead wouldn't lay me so low 
As an answer like that from my Kitty Muldoon. 
My own darlin' Kitty, my golden- haired Kitty, 
My beauliful, dutiful Kitty Muldoon. 
Oh, Kitty, sweet Kitty, take pity on Tim, 
An' beware of O'Dowd with his blarney an' fun;' 
Ye know how I'm filled up with love to the brim, 
An' we ought to get welded at once into one. 
When Father McSherry, our Soggarth, Arocm, 
Says, " Tim, will ye marry Miss Kitty Muldoon?" 
Bow quickly I'll answer, " J3egorra, I 
will!" 
AD' I 
hope that his rev'rence will ask me this soon, 
For my near will not let 1114 be aisy until 
You are Kitty McCarthy instead of M.;Idoori; 
My own darlin' Kitty, my golden-liairv':

OFF YOUR NUT, 
Written and composed by SAM DEVERE. 
As by. words now are all the go, Pm going to give 
you one, 
It's u,Qd by all, both large and small, you'll hear 
it on every tongue; 
An urchin hails you in the street with " Mister, 
shine 'em up?" 
Re wants ten cents, • you offer him five, he says; 
" 
Cully, you're off your nut." 
A_ carriage—a 
carriage, a 
hackman cries, till his 
face gets awful red, 
He's anxious to make a 
dollar or two before he 
goes to bed; 
Yon ask hint to drive you around the town and 
land you right side up, 
ITe winks his eye at his pal, so sly, saying: " That 
rooster is off his nut." 
There's 3-our German tailor, too, who makes such 
stylish clothes, 
What would we do without the man, why, surely 
nobody knows; 
He makes you a 
suit that's hard to- beat, the latest 
Parisian cut, 
If you tell him you'll pay in a 
week he'll say: " I 
don't got off my nut." 
ff on the street you chance to meet a 
friend who 
has been on a 
spree, 
His hat smashed in, his head swelled up, a 
real old 
"jamboree;" 
His clothes are soiled, he's got the shakes, perhaps 
he's bruised and cut, 
He says: 
You know hOw it is yourself, I'm a 
little off my nut."

OFF YOUR NUT.

Now friends, if you'll take my advice, it may do 
you some good, 
I

Don't drink too much, or stay out nights, or you 
never will have any luck, 
You'll ruin yourself both cash and health, and go 
clean off your nut.

yow list ye to my classic lay, 
Politely hearken loudly, while 
I 
sing of Levi Kassiday, 
A 
blazing star of solid style; 
From Coney Islc.s. to Zululand, 
From sweet Cohohohoes to Newfoundland, 
Roam where you will a 
man you'll never find 
Like Levi Kassiday. 
CHORUS. 
For he's a 
man, understan', 
Wid a 
very fine eye for a 
nice young girl, 
And a 
primo judge of Dublin wine, 
And creamy cream of the style, do you mind, 
Wid a 
rose like his nose, 
Of a 
color as bright as the red blue say, 
Oh, it's on the street, there's a 
few you'll meet 
Like Levi Kassiday. 
A-down the street with stately tread, 
And style that dislocates them all, 
Meanders he, enveloped in, - 
A 
brand new fresh spring suit of gaul; 
Upon his arm hangs Julia Ann, 
Sweet lady bird of this daisy man, 
A 
Don Juhannes in his mind is he, 
This Levi Kassiday. 
For he's a 
man, etc. 
When voices sweet were handed round, 
Levi was not behind the door, 
An over strung bass voice has he, 
He sang the " mast" in " Pinafore." 
From Asiah to Kalamazu ' 
From Canadaw to San Franciscu, 
Another one of it you'll seldom meet 
Like Levi Kassiday. 
For he's a 
man, etc.

MARY ANN, 
l'LL TELL YOUR MA. 
Written and Composed by GEOFFMEY THORN. 
r-ungwith great success by TONY PASTOR. 
The music of this song is published by E. H. 
HARDING, 7229 1. Wery 
New York. 
Price 10 cents. 
I 
spoon a 
girl named Mary Ann, a 
tender little dove, 
Who costs me lots of half-pence, and a 
precious deal of love, 
She's living with her mother, as a maiden ought to do, 
And looks as straight and proper as a 
saint, or me or you. 
But. somehow when I 
trot her round, no matter where we go, 
I'm struck with all the people that this maiden seems to know: 
For certain as Mary Ann I 
proudly take about, 
Some heads pop round the corner, and a 
vulgar voice will shme 
CHORUS. 
Oh, very well, Mary Ann, I'll tell your ma, 
She little thought when you came out you'd go so far, 
I'm sure your mother doesn't know the girl you are, 
Mary.Ann, fie! for shame, Yahl yah yah Ohl yah 
We went last Whitsun Monday to the forest by the rail, 
We did the thing first class of course, at that I 
never fail; 
I 
tipp'd the guard a 
sLilling, or what you might call a 
bob, 
To look us in a 
carriage and preserve us from the mob. 
We sat on downy cushions and the curtains drew for fun, 
For Polly said her pretty eyes they could not bear the sun, 
But when we settled snugly and were just about to go 
A head came through the window and a 
fellow shouted— 
Oh, very well, etc. 
We 1,vander'd through the forest glades as happy as could be, 
WeAbought from vulgar peoplt, there, we should at least be free, 
We sought a 
sweet secluded spot, where none our vows could hear \ 
And whisper'd those soft, silly things, that lovers think so dear. 
We 
sat -beneath a 
spreading oak, our loving arms entw i
ned, \j 
While I 
was fond and foolish, she was gentle, sweet and kind; 
But just as I 
my passion told, and sealed it with a 
kiss, 
A chap birds-nesting up above, so rudely shouted this— 
Oh, very well, ete. 
We came away disgusted, and we quickly made for home, 
For everywhere we met the cry, no matter where we'd roam, 
Ann-deciareirt to me she knew those people not, 
In fact, she said she would not mix with such a 
vulgar lot. 
But on this precious mystery I 
have some little doubt, 
And almost think that Mary Ann must know her way about, 
For when w 
e 
parted at-her door, or rather just inside, 
A Mice came down the staircase, and her little brother cried— - 
SPOSEX.—Ohl oht' 
Oh, very well, etc.

THE NIGHT THAT JOHN McCARTHY HOCKED 
HIS WATCH. 
Written by Manx, 13Exxa-rr and sung by Jo 
nlc ICzaNELL. 
It WM on a winter evening in the merry month of 
June, 
The gang all congregated in a 
lager bier saloon; 
They were going on a Jamboree, the reason 
tell 
soon, 
And McCarthy payed for drinks for every one; 
He was working in a 
dollar store at fifty cents a 
day, 
But one fine night he got so tight, he gave himself 
away; 
'he boss did then discharge him, and he didn't get his 
pay, 
And that's the reason why he had to hock his watch. 
CHORUS. 
But such a 
night and such a 
fight I 
never saw before, 
The gang got full of beer and rum and through the 
street did roar; 
McNulty got so paralyzed he tumbled through the 
floor, 
On the night that John McCarthy hocked his watch. 
O'Brien came home staving, and unto his wife says 
he, 
"Do you go get a 
quart of beer, and bring it home to 
me; 
She says, " I'll take your wages, or you'll very quickly 
see 
Yourself lie sprawling on the floor." 
He put up his hands to strike her, when she hit him 
such a 
whack 
Bight underneath his seventh rib, that you could hear 
it crack; 
He fell down the cellar and he nearly broke his back. 
On the night that John McCarthy hocked his watch. 
But such a 
night, etc.

NOW I AM A BOARDER IN THE PENITEN-
TIAREE. 
Written and sung by the Great VON BOYLL, 
When I 
was a 
lad I 
served two terms, 
In the House of Correction, for digging up worms; 
For going a 
fishing when I 
should have been at school, 
And otherwise acting like a d—n 
fool. ( Repeat.) 
I 
acted the fool, and so thoroughlee, 
That now I 
am a 
boarder in the penitentiaree. ( Repeat.) 
I 
never learned no grammar and no arithmetic, 
But I 
learned to chew and smoke, although it made me sick ; 
I 
learned to play " hookey," I 
learned base- ball, 
But never learned no nothing that was no good at all. 
Repeat 
I 
learned so little learning, and so much rascalitee, 
That now I 
am a 
boarder in the Penientiiaree. ( Repeat.) 
I 
learned very little when I 
was at school, 
But I 
learned to play my daddy for a 
good natured fool; 
So be bought me paper collars and a 
second band suit 
For to pass examination at the institute. ( Repeat.) 
And that pass examination /vas so bad for me, 
That they " bounced" me, and so I 
ran away to sea. (Repeat. 
For honesty I 
never gave a 
cent, 
I 
became a 
politician, and to Congress I 
was sent; 
I 
stood in with the gang on every subsidee, 
I 
was Babcock's partner in the Crooked Whiski-ee. ( Repeat. 
I 
was such a 
crooked Congressman, eventuallee, 
That now I 
am a 
boarder in the Penitentiaree. (Repeat.) 
Now young men all, whoever you may be, 
If you don't wish to rise to the top of the tree, 
You must bear in min') when you are sent to school, 
Always to be guided by this golden rtVe. ( Repeat.) 
Leave your books and play " hookey," do just like me. 
And you'll all go to Congress or the Penitentiaree. ( Repeat.)

NO IRISH WANTED HERE. 
Music by DAVE BRAHAN. 
Written and sung by NED TT 
Oh! I'm an Irish laborer, 
Hardy, stout aud strong; 
Idleness I 
never loved— 
To our race it don't belong, 
I've still the strength and will to toil, 
For the wants of life are dear, 
But tould., whene'er I 
ax for work, 
No Irish wanted here ! 
CHORUS. 
Ye might think it a 
misfortune, 
To be christened Pat or Dan ; 
To me it is a 
blesAng to be called an Irishman, 
I 
may live to see the day— 
'Twill come, oh never fear— 
When ignorance gives way to sense ; 
An' ye'll welcome Irish here ! 
Whin your country was in danger, 
A 
few short years ago, 
Ye was not so particular 
About who would fight the foe. 
Whin men were needed for the ranks. 
To preserve her rights so dear, 
Among the bravest of the brave, 
It was, Irish wanted here ? 
Ye might think, etc. 
NO IRISH WANTED HERE. 
(Continued.) 
Far generous hearts and charity, 
Ye may search the world around, \ 
Poor Paddy's hospitality, 
Shure, its like was never fonnd; 
Ile'd give the clothes from of his back 
His blood, for friends so dear! 
But prejudice and envy vile 
Says, no Irish wanted here 1 
Ye might think,-
Oh i 
let your hearts be kind and just, ' 
An' help Paddy from the wall; 
For God in Heaven made the world, 
Wid lots of room for all. 
Let's stretch our hands across the sea, 
To the Green Ould Isle so dear, 
An' give the Irish boys an' girls, 
A 
glad welcome over here! 
As sung with great success by TONY PASTOR. 
I've courted no end of young ladies, 
Sweet little roses and posies, 
Ladies with sweet, pretty faces. 
And ladies with very long noses; 
The rarest of rare, and the fairest of fair, 
When I 
ask for a sweet little kiss. 
With a 
wink of their eye, and a 
wink on the sly. 
The answer they're giving is this, oh, my! 
CHORUS. 
Oh, Fred, don't be so frivolous, 
.0h, Fred, don't be ridiculous! 
You're not like a 
silly, you know what things are, 
I'll see you to-morrow, tra-la-la, ta-ta. 
Girls are in general quite pettish, 
Some are called miss and some missus; 
The best of them all are coquettish, 
The whole jolly lot's fond of kisses. 
I 
kiss pretty lips and I 
squeeze finger tips, 
No matter what I 
have to pay; 
If I 
meet a 
dear maid who is somewhat afraid, 
She'll blush like a 
rose and will say, oh, my! 
Oh, Fred, etc. 
I 
Once knew a 
girl—such a 
sweet one— 
She never was saucy nor pert; 
She then was an innocent maiden, 
But now she's a 
saucy little flirt; 
We met t'other night, I 
was very near tight, 
Her mother was out of the way: 
I 
gave her a kiss that was brimming -with bliss, 
Tho' she liked it she to me did sny. oh, my! 
Oh. PrNI, etc.

OUR PATRICK IS AN ACTOR. 
Written expressly for LEONARD Sc JONES, by FRANK nrmon. 
We've raised a 
dozen childrem—proud of them am I— 
Some of them are influential and hold positiOns high; 
And I 
have lovely daughters; the fact can't be denied; 
They wear their silks and satins and in a 
carriage ride. 
There's Barney, Dan and Jerry, with Larry, Ted and 
Mike, 
All elegant and scholars—you never saw the like; 
But the worst of all is Patrick; the facts are, as you 
see, 
He's traveling with a 
circus an actor man to be. 
CHORUS. 
Patrick is an actor, and wears the finest clothes; 
The ladies all admire him, no matter where he goes, 
With a 
diamond on his shirt-front—a lump the big 
of that; 
'Tis folly to deny it—a 
dandy is our Pat. 
(Repeat.) 
When he's home upon a 
visit, neighbors far and near 
Will send him invitations to have cigars and beer. 
When I 
cook corn-beef and cabbage to make a 
lovely 
meal 
Patrick doesn't touch it, so dainty does he feel; 
But he'll eat ice cream an' peaches, Wane, mange and 
- 
custard pie; 
It's the style he learned from actors; they're always 
living high. 
But in spite of all his manners a 
word for him we'll 
speak: 
He don't forget his parents with money every week. 
Patrick is an ax-,

SCOTCH TERRIER JAN E.' 
Sung by FIELDS & HANSON. 
I 
once knew a 
maiden who in New York did dwell, 
She was ugly and cranky all the time; 
She was stuck on a 
baker and a 
dizzy undertaker. 
And a 
butcher in Cincinnati over the Rhine. 
One night the butcher called with a 
couple of pork 
chops, 
His love he tried to explain, 
lie gave her a 
squeeze and oil came his nose 
Prom the breath of this Scotch Terrier Jane. 
Cnouus. 
Oh, Jane, oh, Jane, I've got you on the brain, 
You have no reason to explain. 
Your teeth they are false, from taking Epsom salts, 
You're my liver lip Scotch Terrier Jane. 
She's lovely and fair and her feet they were bare, 
Her bustle stuck out twenty feet; 
One day in the house she happened to eat a 
moue, 
It gave all her lovers a 
treat. 
The butcher and the baker and the dizzy undertaker, 
They went crazy when they all heard the news, 
I 
often heard them say, when she was put away, 
E3he died from hoisting Mott Street booze._

SINCE MICHAEL LEARNED TO DANCE. 
Sung by JOHN KERNELIA. 
MY 
name it is O'Donovan, 
I 
live in Jersey City, 
I 
have three boys, and four big girls, 
On me they have no pity; 
My eldest boy about nineteen, 
He sings a 
song called " Dancing on the Green," 
Not a 
day's luck, in the house is seen, 
Since Michael learned to dance. 
He has all the boys and girls taught, 
To waltz around upon their toes; 
He practised kicking yesterday noon, 
And busted all his clothes ; 
He comes from the theatre about daylight, 
And says with the actors he had a 
terrible fight; 
The house is a 
circus from morn till night, 
Since Michael learned to dance. 
He brought home stuff he called burnt cork, 
Where he says he got at the play halls; 
He broke the clock, 
Trying to stand on his head; 
While he done some funny falls, 
As an actor he says he's great, 
My family to Hoboken must emigrate, 
Since Michael learned to dance. 
He calls his sister a 
leading lady, 
He -wrote a 
drama, called the " Stolen Cheese," 
He played a 
year at Sing Sing, 
Doing a 
cornet solo upon a 
high trapeze: 
The manger fold him to write again, 
Ht doubled up with Geo. Francis Train, 
Begorra, I 
have water on the brain, 
Since Michael learned to dance.

SLIGO MUSKETEERS. 
As originally purloined from JIM O'NEAL by EDDY Fisu, and sung 
with tremendous success by JOHNNY ROACH and CHARLEY 
LADENDORIT. 
Now let ye stand from under, and open wide your 
ears, 
While we relate the history of the Sligo Musketeers. 
When first we landed on this soil, out West we had 
to go, 
For tr work upon canaling in the state of Oheho; 
And .ien the war it did break out, they took our 
jobs away, 
So we organized a 
company, and started for the fray. 
We fought the wild red Indian braves for many a 
• weary day; 
But they couldn't beat the Sligo Musketeers. 
CHORUS. 
With me ha, ha, ha, foot straw, we marched across 
the plain, 
And many a 
weary day we thought we'd never see 
home again; 
The Indians fought like blazes, but their fighting 
was in vain, 
For they couldn't down the Sligo Musketeers. 
We fought with Banks and Burnside, with Grant 
we took a 
hack; 
But best of all though he was small, was gallant lit-
tle Mac; 
And if they'd let him have his way, the enemy he'd 
drive back. 
With the assistance of the Sligo Musketeers, 
For he knew how to engineer, and likewise take 
command, 
No matter what your station was, he'd take you by 
the hand. 
He lvoked so noble on his horse when he was in com-
mand, 
Of us fighting boys, the Sligo Musketeers. 
With me ha, ha; ha, etc.

Down on the dock they had a

Oh! jolly sailors, collie, tell me true,

Oh! then, jolly sailors, come, tell me true,

Oh! the captain on the deck then stood, 
He was covered all over with muck and mud, 
Oh! jolly sailor, I

Pat Clancy broke— 
Pat Clancy broke your bran new T. shovel in two,

KELLY.. 
Sung by KELLY, & RYAN, in thier laughable sketch entiled 
" 
Family Troubles," 
M Y name is Dan O'Rielly, 
I 
live in New Jersey ; 
When my work keeps me out night*, 
My wife goes on a 
spree. 
She gathers all the neighbors, 
For she never drinks alone ; 
Now I'll tell you how I 
found them, 
That ilight when I 
got home. 
When I 
got home they were dancing, 
Sure, I 
thought the house would fall; 
Old Casey with his fiddle, 
Was propped against the wall. 
Pat Hennessey was singing 
The" Sweet Maid from Athlone ;" 
Well, they were raising the very divil, 
That night when I 
got home. 
McGinnis the old bummer; 
Had on my new frock coat; 
And my fine silk dollar neck- tie, 
Wrapped around his dirty throat. 
THAT NIGHT WHEN I GOT HOME. 
Contsntted. 
My wife she was a 
yelling, 
In the corner all alone; 
'Twas worse than any mad-house, 
That night when I 
got home. 
My new black shining beaver, 
Made a 
kdittoort on the floor ; 
They've being no napkins in the house, 
Sure ray clean white shirts they tore. 
%Veil the " Bards of Tara" was singing, 
Old Mr. and Mrs. Malone ; 
Ar.d the" Hod-Carri rs" was singing the diorite, 
That night when I 
got home. 
With a 
boot-jack in ray right hand, 
I 
rushed around the room ; 
Between kicking and thumping 
I 
cleaned it very soon. 
But the battle quickly ended, 
Then like a 
king up)n his thr.413, 
I 
gazed upon my ruined castle, 
That Alight when I 
got home. 
THERE'S A BOTTLE ON THE MANTLE 
Air.—Letter in the Candie. 
As sung by HARRY W OODSoN. 
THERE'S a 
bottle on the mantle, 
But it don't belong to me; 
If I 
could only smell the flavor, 
How happy I 
would be. 
But I 
dare not approach it, 
For fear some one would come in ; 
But I 
would like to take a 
snifter, 
For I 
know it's full of gin. 
CHORUS. 
Small drop of gin, 
To wet my fiery tongue; 
I 
loved you since my childhood, 
Many songs of you I 
have sung. 
Oh! how sadly I 
remember, 
It was two short months ago, 
I 
had a 
bully lunch route, 
But they took me down below. 
They said I 
was a 
vagarant— 
And I 
think it was a 
sin 
To lock me in a 
dungeon, 
And deprive me of my gin. 
Small drop of gin, eta.

YOU SHOULD SEE MY MARY ANN. 
Words and Music by Tim ROSEKS. 
As sung by him witN, great 
success, at HARRIGAN & HmaT's Theatre Cormque. 
I'VE got a 
sweetheart, she looks like a 
queen, 
Her hair it is red, and her age is sixteen, 
She's from Kildare, she's not very green, 
She's one of the fairest your eyes ever seen. 
She sings " Eileen Alanna," plays on the piano, 
With a 
voice soprano, that's cozy and sweet, 
But when she sits down to play " Lakes of Killaraer 
She frightens the children off of the street. 
CHORUS. 
You should see Mary, she's light as a 
fairy. 
Sings like a 
canary, from ould Tipperay 
She is not airy, she attends to the dairy 
She's never contrary, my own Mary At 
I 
took lovely Mary one night to a 
ball, 
To a 
massacred hop, down to \Valhalla flab, 
She swung the side quadrille the best of them alt, 
But get her to dance, faith I 
couldn't at all.' 
Says I, lovely Mary, will you waltz the next quadrille ? 
Says she, excuse me, Levi, I'm losing my health. 
Her corns they did ache her, she took off her shoe, 
And in two minnte's time she had the ball to herself: 
You should see Mary, etc. 
When the dancing was over, some one sung a 
song, 
And in popped a 
nagur, and struck a 
big gong, 
lie shouted out fire, and flew straight along. 
She fell down the steps, and I 
thought she was gone ; 
I 
caught her and convinced her the gong went for sapper., 
Ale sat down to the table, and done it up brown. 
The fruit that she eat was onions and garlic ; 
The perfunv. from her breath would knock a 
man down 
You should see Mary, etc

THE WRESTLE OF THE CATS. 
Written by isms's CufpnELL, and delivered by O'Nim. and CO2raor, 
with shouts of laughter and applause. 
Mrs. Maloney had a 
cat, and a 
female cat was she, 
Her voice it was a 
soprano, and she sung in the key 
of G. 
Oh, it was my delight, of a 
starry night, when com-
ing home from a 
ball, 
To hear her singing " We met by chance," on the 
top of Maloney's wall. 
I 
know she went up as high as " G," and sometimes 
I 
think she went higher, 
And the way she dwelt, on the very last note, you'd 
think she was hollering fire! 
I 
really think she could say the word fire! but still 
I'll not swear to that, 
For I 
wouldn't like to make a 
liar of Mrs. Maloney's 
cat. 
Now, old Mrs. McFadden, she had a 
Tom, (a cat I 
mean by that name), 
And she called Mrs. Maloney's cat, in the other 
yard, a 
most disrespectful name. 
Maloney's cat cried out " You're another!" then Mc-
Fadden's loudly did bawl, 
"You sucker, send out your big brother, or come 
- 
yourself over the wall. 
I'll wrestle you, collar and elbow, I'll throw you 
as quick as 0. rat!" 
" 
Arrah, don't be getting your back up!" says Mrs. 
Maloney's cat. 
Now, Jerry McGill had a 
bull dog, and Jerry, he lived 
in the rear, 
And the hull dog was lean, lank, and hungry, and 
divil a 
cat did he fear; 
Now, Jerry, he called his dog " Boney," says he 
" 
Now, 
bet a 
new hat, 
If I 
leave off his chain and his muzzle, he'll make 
sausage-meat out of them cats." 
One night, (it was dark and dreary, and the divil a 
star in the sky), 
Boney had off his chain and his muzzle, and he laid 
for the cats on the sly. 
ri

THE WRESTLE OF THE CATS.—CONTINUED. 
Now, the cats, they met in the hallway, and they 
wrestled clean out to the yard, 
The first hold was " collar and elbow," and their 
• breathing was terrible hard; 
Then they both tried " Grteco Roman," but you 
couldn't tell who got first fall, 
And Boney was acting as referee in the shade of 
the garden wall. 
They howled, and they spit, and they fluttered, and 
the blood from their noses ran, 
Says Boney " I'll take a 
new hoult, I'll wrestle them 
catch, catch, can." 
Then, like lightning he sprang in amongst them, 
In his jaws he had one by the back, 
Such a 
yell was ne'er heard in that quarter, 
As came from Maloney's poor cat. 
McFadden's cat fought like a 
tiger, 
But Boney's strength didn't him fail 
With a 
twist of his jaws, like a 
general 
He bit off McFadden's cat's tail. 
Oh., the howling, and yelling, and growling of the 
dog and the cats filled the air, 
And the windows all round in the barracks flew open 
everywhere. 
Heads with night-caps of old men and old women and 
children, poked out in the dark, 
They thought that the house was on fire, or the divil 
was out on a 
lark ; 
They tried to look out in the darkness where the 
noise came from down by the wall, 
And thinking some one was being murdered, they 
loud for the police did bawl. 
Then they came out in droves and in dozens, 
The children, old women and men, 
With candles, with lamps, and with matche3, 
But ah! what a 
sight met them then— 
t.
-McFadden, and Mrs. Maloney, 
They sorrowfully shook their night-caps, 
To see McGill's .bull dog, old Bcney, 
Holding'a wake over the two defunct cats. 
My name is Cornelius O'Sullivan, Esquire, 
I'm a 
politician of great fame, 
I've a 
record of being an honest man, 
To an office I 
hold a 
claim; 
If elected I 
will make my mark, 
Do wrong I 
have no cause, 
I'll put all thriving politicians in jail, 
And preserve the country's laws. 
CHORUS. 
I'll do all I 
can for the workingman, 
I'll always act on the square, 
There'll be furnished rooms in the park for 
bums 
When Sullivan is the Mayor. 
Vu have the Chinese for sparrow police, 
The horse-cars and boats will be free, 
Run the elevated railroad over to Jersey, 
Commence work at nine and stop at three. 
Put girls to work on the Brooklyn bridge, 
It's then they'd have a 
lark, 
I'll hire a 
hundred thousand men to build 
A roof over Central Park. 
CHORUS. 
You'll have better thnes than before the war, 
Ride free and pay no fare, 
I'll move the East River to Canada 
When Sullivan is the Mayor.
