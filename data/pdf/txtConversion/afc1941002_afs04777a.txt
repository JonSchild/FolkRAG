My grandfather was a blacksmith. My father was a young kid, wasn't grown. And my father had
learned how to write a little bit in Richmond, Virginia, before they brought him down here. Grandpa
used to keep chalk in his shop to mark ??? things; and my father take a piece put in his pocket and
pass in front master Jeff's house he write on the sidewalk. And so one morning master Jeff come
by and saw that writing on the walk, he go back and ask the cook, [old lady named (?)] Meli, Meliza:
“There's writing on the sidewalk, who writing out there?” Say, “I don't know master Jeff.” Say, “Come
out there I show to you. I can read it.” So he read it. He say, “Meliza, if you can find out who ever
wrote on that walk out there, [I carry you down (?)] to the store and give you a free dress.” She say,
Interview with Mr. George Johnson, Mound Bayou, Mississippi, September 1941 http://www.loc.gov/item/afc1941002_000140
“Yes, master, Jeff.” So, one morning she's out, throw out some dishwater. And she peek under the
dishpan and she look down and saw my father down on his knees writing on the sidewalk. She told
master Jeff. Master Jeff sent for the boy to come to the shop. Come to the house, and, ah, asked him
who learned him how to write? He said, “Master Jeff, I learned how to write Richmond, Virginia. A
white woman learned me how to write. Before you brought me down here.” “You did?” “Yes, sir.” He
give him a pencil and [say] “Write my name.” My father's name, Isaiah. He called him, “Ike, write my
name.” He wrote Jeff Davis' name. He said write, “Joe Davis.” He wrote, “Joe Davis.” “Write Vicksburg.”
He wrote “Vicksburg,” you see. “Ah ha, Ike, that's pretty nice for you.” And he send him on back
to the shop and master Jeff's son from Richmond, Virginia, and got two teachers. They opened
a nice school. Educate all his niggas. And made my father a civil engineer. And then made Isaiah
Montgomery his bookkeeper. And on and on they made different ones ??? farmers, carpenters,
sawmills, gins and all like that. That's just because of, of, of, of my father and Isaiah Montgomery.
Isaiah is born Davis' Bend. He born on, on the Hurricane Plantation. Just [giant ??? (?)] from Brierfield.
I was born on Brierfield. Master Jeff had five plantations over there: Ursino, Brierfield, Hurricane,
Palmyra and Lick Place. It all belong to master Jeff. And ah, had all those niggas from different places,
on those plantation to come to that school. Nice school. He give them all a formal education. When
they all got free, they could take care theyself. They had so much business they couldn't hire [people
(?)] who got business, you just can't give a nigga a education so he can tend to his business. Everyone
learned tend to master Jeff's business. Everyone admired him. Obeyed him. Don't care where he's
going he obeyed master Jeff. Once master Jeff was going to landing in a buggy, in a hack. The gate
was locked. That same old man I tell you about, Old Man Jack Raily, he got to the gate, say “Master
Jeff this gate's locked.” He say, “Oh, well, Jack, it's locked, it's my gate, break it down! It's my gate.”
So the boy pick it up and Jack said, “Break down the gate!” He took the fence down. And drove on
through there and the wagon on behind him, you understand, with the band, carry him to the
landing; and when they come back they put the fence up. That's the reason why master Jeff need
his Negro. And when he met his Negro on the road first thing master Jeff look up there and see if
he tip his hat to him. And everyone give him the same thing back. Give him honor. And when he
come home from New Orleans up to the Bend, steamboat landing, unloaded the freight and loading
cotton. And ah, he be up the bed there sleep and the captain would say, “Mr. Davis' up?” “No he ain't
up.” “Well, when he [come up (?)], when he wake up?” Mr. Davis wake up and he come downstairs.
He pick up ??? . He pack it up out on the land set it down side his hat. And he get up there by [his
boots (?)] third time before he gets his hat. He never allowed him to do it just like that. You just obey
him. Well, they all obey master Jeff. The white people would alway's go up the bank and go fishing
and hunting on the banks when master Jeff be in the bed sleep. They ain't never do him like that.
They would always obey him all the time. White and black. They gave him honor. His best man would
escort him home. Escort him back when he got ready. And ah, he was on the plantation that one
day, on Lickfield Place, he told Mrs. [Coldyarn (?)] say, “Mrs. [Coldyarn (?)], I'm going home tomorrow,
Interview with Mr. George Johnson, Mound Bayou, Mississippi, September 1941 http://www.loc.gov/item/afc1941002_000140
don't forget to feed my niggas. When they get through ??? by the crops, let them be. Wouldn't even
let them cut cord wood. But don't disturb them. I want them undisturbed. See, anything happen to
any my Negroes, we to see Mr. Davis. And don't forget, I'm Mr. Davis. See, my Negroes is my summer
shade. He's my winter fire. He's my umbrella. Don't disturb them.” So all they live by the crops over
there with the sweeps. Mrs. [Coldyarn (?)] once live by the crops with the ??? that wouldn't do no
good. Wouldn't cut those vines. The Negro, the Negro master Jeff educated, one old ??? slave, live
by the crop with the ??? sweeps. And he come back and he held court. And the next day he fired the
white man. He wanted the place lead, lead by he wanted. He lead by the crops like he wanted, you
understand? He had the crops clean, master Jeff come. With those little big sweeps, you un, going
in middle. Clean them out you understand. With your ??? cause he kept those vines. Jumped those
vines. Sweep. Get them all out. Clean this place out. Lick Place. He had a hundred things over there.
Got all those mules from different plantation, you understand, come over and clean that place.
He had plenty of stock, you know. They raised stock All this, now on Hurricane, the pasture there,
oh ??? , understand, roadside you know. All that stock it belong to master Jeff. All that stock: mules,
cows, horses everything else. Hogs everything else. Sheep. Goats. All belonged to him. Now he had
those sheeps sheared certain time of year and bale that wool and shipped it somewhere. Same they
do cotton. Carry it to the gin and packed it. Had three or four steam engines, understand, you see.
Steam engine on Hurricane. One on Brierfield. One on Ursino. He had three gins. I know, he had
three gin. ??? and he had a sawmill on Hurricane called, Steam Mill Quarter. And all that belonged to
old master Jeff. And when he wanted things done he just put it on paper and it's gone. It done. He
had no trouble at all. All his niggas had a common education. All ofthem.
Dr. Charles S. Johnson: You, tell me how ah, the, how, the story as to how Isaiah T. Montgomery's
father saved the plantation during the Civil War for him?
Mr. George Johnson: Yes, well, when, when, when, ah the Yankee was coming South. Look after those
places down there to rob somebody. Uncle Ben see it. Uncle Ben went to old Mrs. Mrs. Irene, his
wife, say, “Well, Mrs. I'm have to go Richmond. Got to see master Jeff.” She say, “What you want to
see master Jeff for, Ben?” Say, “I got to see him.” Say, “??? No, Mrs. you can't do no good. I can't, I
don't want to see you. I want to see master Jeff. I want a passport. Send me to Richmond, Virginia,
see master Jeff.” So they give Uncle Ben the passport. He went on to Richmond. Got some bread
in his sack and went on to Richmond, Virginia. Got on his ??? where he went on to Vicksburg. On
to Richmond, Virginia, and met master Jeff ??? [Mr. Johnson taps his cane to imitate Benjamin T.
Montgomery, knocking on Jefferson Davis' door] “Whose that? Come in.” Walk in there. “Hi there master
Jeff.” “Hey, Ben, what you doing here?” Say, “I come here to see you master Jeff.” Say, “Ben, sit down
and tell me all you know. How everybody doing?” “Everybody all right master Jeff, but something
