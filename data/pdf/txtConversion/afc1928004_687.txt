TWO BENJAMINS. 
Original with COGILL 
and COOPER (Charles W. Cogill and Fred. A. 
Cooper), and sung with great success by the Cogill Bro's (Chas. 
W. and Harry P.) in their original style of specialty, entitled 
" 
Chit Chat." 
SEE our style and dashing figures, 
We always travel with the upper ten; 
Don't you think that we're extraordinary niggers? 
We're easy, careless, lively Benjamins. 
We were raised quite young by our father and mother, 
Ever since we were two little picayunes; 
We're also twins to our other little brother, 
A.nd as lively and as smart as crickets or coons. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, my gracious! watch us throw our feet, (
break.) 
Oh, hallelujah! us coons am hard to beat, (
break.) 
It is easy for to see we darkeys are no shams, 
We're easy, careless, lively Benjamins. 
In town, they say we are high-toned darks; 
With fashions we're bound to keep along; 
They also say we're colored men of mark, 
And of course you know their opinion isn't wrong. 
You can never, 'pon our word, see us niggers associate 
With any of the other colored men. 
You will find our names in the morning papers, 
Stated saucy and free, with the flourish of a 
pen. 
Oh, my gracious I 
etc. 
Now if there are any young girls in the city, 
That would just throw themselves away, 
On us colored individuals take pity, 
For you know we have not long to stay; 
We will do all the cooking, keep the house to rights, 
Keep the hotel as bright as a 
gem; 
You mustn't find fault if we come in late at night, 
We'll come in when you hear the cackling of the hens. 
Oh, my gracious! etc.

TliE ITALIAN MOUNTAIN MAID, 
As sung v. ith treat success by JAMES GRAY. 
THERE is a 
pretty little maiden that I 
ever dearly love, 
In Italy that bright and sunny land ; 
My life would be a 
pleasure, I 
-would ask for nothing more, 
If she would share my heart and hand. 
For her father was a 
brigand on a 
lonely mountain pass, 
And with him on the mountain she does dwell. 
There is no titled lady in all Europe can surpass 
The dear Italian girl I 
love so well. 
CHORUS. 
Her fatlT was a 
brigand on the mountain. 
She is as gentle as the daughter of an earl, 
And sinoe she set me free, my heart will ever be 
A 
enitive to the dear Italian girl. 
While rooming through the village 'neath the blue and 
sunny sky. 
A 
band of sturdy brigands bold and strong, 
Did capture me, and helpless, put a 
bandage on my eyes. 
A 
victim I 
was quickly led along. 
Five thousand pounds as ransom they said that I 
should 
PaY, 
But that I 
was not -rich enough to give, 
And only for the pleading of this little mountain maid 
They would not have permitted me to live. 
Her father was, etc. 
They put me in a 
dungeon where I 
thought that I 
should 
And while the brigand chief with all his band, 
Was plundering poor travelers, this lovely maid came 
nigh 
At gloomy night and by my side did stand. 
She. tore my tH n 
is asunder, bade me rise and set me free, 
And from her father's coffers saved my gold, 
And while the tears of love and pity gladdened in her 
eyes, 
The secret of our hearts was plainly told. 
Her father was, etc.

ALL DE DARKEYS GITTLW UP. 
Composed and sung by Jim GRACE. 
The Music of this song is published by WI:UTZ, SMITE 
Co., Bastes., 
Mass. 
Price 35 cents. 
Wu are a 
band of sinners, 
And we am gone away; 
We're sailin' on de sea of sin, 
And we hab lost de way; 
Ole Satan stole de compass, 
To see if we had pluck, 
We heard de voice of Gabriel 
Say, Don't you trust to luck. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, yes, he did; oh, yes, he did; den all de darkeys git-
tin' up, 
Den all de darkeys gittin' up; 
Oh, yes, he did; oh, yes, he did; den all de darkeys git-
tin' up; 
For dey hab lost de way. 
De storm is on de mountain, 
De wind is on de shore, 
When I 
hab climbed de golden gate . 
I'll go and sin no more; 
Ole massa he's a 
hypocrite, 
He prays so loud on Sunday, 
And when we're in de cornfied, 
He whips us all on Monday. 
Oh, yes, he did, eta. 
Now we are for glory, 
We'll watch de golden gate, 
And when we see ole massa Jar, 
He'll find he's come too late; 
We were a 
band of sinners, 
But now we're on de track, 
Ole Satin's lost his reck'nin', 
We're nebber goin' back. 
Oh, yes, he did, etc. 
DARKEYS ON THE LEVEE. 
Original with W ELCH and RICE, and performed with sole permission 
from them, with great success, by the CooiLL BnoTHEns. 
On, happy darkeys, working on the levee, 
Waiting for the steamers to come down, 
All the cotton in the bales am ready, 
We hope they haven't stuck or run aground; 
Oh, what lots of fun to load the Natchez, 
Or the steamer Robert E. Lee, (
whistle.) 
Tote the cargo from the banks, 
All the time singing merrily, 
CHORUS. 
What's that we hear ? (
whistles.) 
Whistles loud and clear ; (
whistles.) 
We think it am the Natchez or the Robert E. Lee, 
Come along, water-dogs, and merrily we'll be. 
(Repeat last two lines.) 
When the boats arrive we have some fun, 
All the darkeys shout aloud with glee, 
Hop about, skip about and run, 
Just as happy, happy as can be; 
Oh, when our work is done we get our pay 
From the Captain of the boat we know, (
whistle.) 
Then up the street a 
little while so gay, 
On a 
jamboree we surely go. 
cnonts. 
What's that we hear ? (

Whistles loud and clear, (

We think it am the Natchez or the Robert E. Lee, 
Come along, water-dogs, and merrily we'll be. 
THE HARD-BACK FAMILY. 
Written awl. composed by EDWIN' FRENCH. 
Music sent by us to any address. 
Price, 35 cents, 
Copyright, 1879, by Louis P. GouLLAmo. 
As sung by Haverly's Georgia Minstrels. 
I WENT to see my girl one night, 
She was there when I 
arrived ; 
I'm getting along fast in love, you bet, 
It is a 
great surprise. 
I 
asked her for her coal-black hand, 
Be mine forevermore, 
I 
tell you the family flew at me, 
And chased me from de door. 
I'm going away to leave you, 
I 
can't stop on de way ; 
Clear de track and don't pester me, 
For I 
can no longer stay. 
CHORUS. 
I'll drive the gospel engine, 
drive her through the land; 
Swing on the golden chariot, 
In that far off happy land. 
I 
took my love to de engine house, 
To see de fire machine, 
Her hair flew back on de top of her head, 
She looked like a 
Dutch May queen. 
Her dress was white, and her smile was bright. 
Her figure gaunt and lean; 
She was brigadier general of a 
market store. 
Sold hammers, turtles and cream. 
I'm going away to leave you, 
I 
can't stop on de way, 
Clear de track, and don't pester me, 
For I 
can no longer stay. 
I'll drive the gospel, eta.

Words by ARTHUR W . 
FRENCH. Music by Gronnz W Bnovrit. 
XIWIC of this song is published by OLIVER Drrsox and Co.,451 Washing-
ton St., Boston, Mass. Price 40 cents. 
I 
Am waiting in the wildwood, Essie dear! 
Beside the stream that murmurs sweet and low, 
In the nook we've known since childhood, Essie dear, 
Where sunbeams on the ripples come and go; 
Overhead the birds are singing in the trees, 
While their joyous carols echo through the dell; 
Where the violets are smiling in the breeze, 
There our happy, happy tale of love we'll tell. 
CHORUS. 
I 
am waiting in the wildwood, Essie dear! 
Beside the stream that murmurs sweet and low, 
In the nook we've known since childhood, Essie dear, 
Where oft we've met in happy days ago. 
Linger not, but haste to meet me, Essie dear! 
Down where we've roamed in merry days " Lang syne." 
I 
am waiting here to greet thee, Essie dear, 
For I 
long to hear you whisper " Ever thine." 
! 
I 
love you more than all the world beside, 
Ever true you've been in sorrow and in pain; 
You were the star my weary heart to guide, 
flow I 
long to hear your winning voice again I 
I 
am waiting in the wildwood. eta.

WHISPERING IN- THE TWILIGHT. 
Sung by S.

W HISPERING softly in the twilight, 
In the days so long ago; 
One bright face with golden ringlets, 
One gentle voice so sweet and low; 
Shall we never, never meet again, 
Darling, tell—dost thou know ? 
CHORUS. 
Whispering softly in the twilight, 
In the days so long ago; 
Face so fair, with golden ringlets, 
In the twilight, whispering low. 
Ling'ring, waiting in the twilight, 
Darling little face so fair; 
In my dreams once more I 
see thee, 
As though I 
still were lingering there, 
And I 
know that thou art waiting, 
Somewhere on the mystic shore. 
Whispering softly, eta. 
ANGELS MEET ON THE CROSS-ROADS. 
Sung with great applause by BILLY KERSANDS. 
Fyn lived for months, and lived for years— 
Can't get use to my weeping tears— 
Loss my way on road in sin— 
Then wake angels and pass me in, oh! 
CHORUS. 
Oh angels meet me on the cross-roads, meet me, 
Oh angels meet me on the cross-roads, meet me, 
Angels meet me on the cross-roads, meet me, 
Don't charge sinners any toll. 
What kind shoes is those them angels wear 
That they walk up yonder, up in the air ? 
Stand by the gate till I 
hear angels knock, 
Then 
drop all ray pickles in missionary box. 
Oh angels meet me, etc. 
Angel, I 
ain't got to wait, 
Standing now at the golden gate. 
When I 
get on that other shore, 
I'll walk right in and shut the door. Oh! 
Oh angels, meet me, eta.'

Words and music by W M. J. 
ScANI.ON. 
Music published by T. B. 1.1A1131S & Co., 819 Broadway, New York. 
ON 
a 
cold winter's evening, when bus'ness is done, 
And to your home you retire, 
What a 
pleasure it is to have a 
bright bouncing boy, 
One whom you love to admire ; 
You hug him, and kiss him, you press him to your heart, 
What joy to your bosom ' twill bring! 
Then you place him on the carpet, and you'll hide behind 
the chair, 
And to please him you'll commence to sing: 
CHORUS. 
Peek-a-boo! peek-a-boo! 
Come from behind the chair ; 
Peek-a-boo! peek-a-boo! 
I 
see you hiding there, 
Oh! you rascal, there. 
Oh, my hearfr 
ways light when at home with my wife, 
There joy and peace ever reign ; 
With my boy on my knee I'm as happy as can be, 
I 
never know care or pain ; 
He's pretty, he's gentle, he's kind and he is good, 
And ev'rything nice him I 
bring ! 
Oh, if he attempts to cry when I 
am standing by. 
Just to please him I 
commence to sing : 
Peek a- boo! etc.

I'VE wandered very far away 
From the clime where I 
was born, 
And my poor heart has been so sad, 
Dejected and forlorn; 
No master kind to treat me well, 
To cheer me when in pain; 
I 
want to see the cotton fields 
And the dear old home ' gain. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, the good old days Pre pass'd and gone, 
I 
sigh for them in vain; 
I 
want to see the cotton fields 
And the dear old honoe again. 
I'm left all sad and lonely 110W, 
When my days are ver;f few, 
My wife and children both Axe gone, 
I 
don't know what to do; 
Old master too, he may be &Ad, 
His hair was turning gray; 
Oh, let me see that good old horst. 
Before I 
pass away. 
Oh, the good old days. ete. 
When I 
was free I 
left that land 
Where the days are bright and fair, 
Where missus spoke to me so kind, 
When I 
was bowed with care; 
I 
left that home no friends to find, 
My heart was fill'd with pain; 
Oh, take me to that good old home, 
To see it once again. 
Oh, the good old days, eie.

THE MOON IS OUT TO-NIGHT, LOVE. 
Bung by Det.EuArry and IissGLEB. 
Tux moon is out to-night, love, floating through the sky, 
The little stars are laughing as she passes by, 
All the little songsters sing their pretty tune, 
Happy as they can be singing to the moon. 
Clouds of silver lining waiting in the sky, 
For the moon to pass them; Jessie, so am I. 
For I've come to meet you with a 
happy smile, 
To tell you how I 
love you, sitting on the stile. 
The moon is out to-night, love, meet me with a 
smile, 
I've something sweet to tell you, sitting on the stile; 
Kiss me when you meet me, Jessie of the Glen, 
And when I 
go to leave you I'll give it back again. 
The moon is out to-night, love, all the roses blush, 
When the gentle night winds tell the birds to hush, 
For I 
want to listen for a 
merry voice, 
Whose every note is music, and makes my heart rejoice; 
Jessie, I 
am watching to see if I 
can see 
Some one like a 
fairy coming towards me; 
Ah the little angel coming once again, 
I've a 
kiss of true love for Jessie of tl.e Glen. 
The moon is out, etc.

DAMASK ROSES. 
Original with CoGILL BitonlEns, and sung with great success in 
their original specialty entitled " Points." 
TITP law is passed, the votes are cast, 
The colored race is free; 
This day we'll make a

Let's have have a 
jubilee; 
We mean to run for senators, 
That's if the State proposes; 
Just look at us, (vim.) gaze on us, (vim.) 
We're a 
pair of damask roses. 
The men are mad, the ladies sad 
And some they get enraged, 
Because we've both got handsome girls, 
And because we're both engaged. 
A colored fig last Saturday, 
They call him handsome Moses, 
Swore he would fight, (
slim.) 
With all his might, (gym,) 
This pair of damask roses. 
Come sing with us with joy and glee, 
Let's do the best we can, 
For we are two darkeys black, 
And we hate the Chinaman; 
You ought to cut their long tails off, 
And smash their monkey noses, 
So spruce and gay, (
sym.) we feel to- day, (

We're a 
pair of damask roses.

I

No damsel yet was half so fair as she; 
She vowed that she'd be true to me 
Down in the valley whe e

And where beside a

It was a 
happy moment when first she let me know 
She lov'd me in the valley where the daisies grow, 
'twas a 
joy to me, my heart was full of glee, 
When she agreed my loving bride to be, 
And vow`d that she'd be true to me, 
Down in the valley where the daisies grow.

Written by FRANK D177401;7, and sung by H ARRY W OODSON With irrefilk 
SUCC088 at TONT PASTOR'S. 
FAR away in the South, among the cotton fields. 
Is the place I 
ever long to see; 
Oh! the dear sunny clime where I 
was bred and born, 
And the memory is ever dear to me; 
Oh! the mocking bird's singing in the trees close by, 
While far from the spot I 
now roam, 
In this wide, weary world wherever I 
may go, 
There is no place like the dear old home. 
CHORUS. 
Then give me a 
home in the dear old South, 
For fondly I 
love it still ; 
Then I 
sigh night and day, what I 
long to see again 
Is that old log cabin on the hill. 
Oh ! the ones I 
love is sleeping in the ground, 
When I 
am passing so fast away, 
And my heart grows so sad I 
long to return, 
Oh ! the old man ain't what he used to be ; 
And the magnolias bloom around the cabin door, 
Tis then I 
turn with a 
sigh, 
Oh ! I 
will go back again, back to them cotton fields. 
In that old cabin home there let me die. 
Then give me, eta.

THE LAND OF DREAMS. 
As 
sung by T. 
M. 
HENGLER. 
IN 
the pleasant summer evening, 
I 
lie beneath the shade, 
'Watching the shadows 
That dance on the meadows, 
When the day begins to fade ; 
When the sweet remembrance comes to me 
Like a 
long forgotten strain 
Of music, awaking 
And. freshly breaking 
Over my heart again. 
In visions of the past, 
I 
see my love arise. 
And in my dreaming 
I 
feel the beaming 
Of her soft, compassionate eyes. 
Ahi! thus may saddened hearts renew 
Their life's pure morning beams, 
On the past to ponder, 
And softly wander, 
Into—The Land of Dreams.

WHA_T'S THE MATTER ? 
Written by M. J. 
W ILT() 
THE Captain comes on deck 
When he hears a 
little clatter, 
And as he pops his head above 
Cries out : " What is the matter ?" 
CHORUS. 
Why, what's the matter, 
Why this clatter ; 
What has caused this rumpus, pray ? 
While I 
was sleeping, 
You were keeping 
This infernal noise all day. 
Then without more ado, 
lie demands an explanation; 
I 
told him it was caused by 
A kind of oscillation. 
Why, what's the matter, etc. 
I 
jumped upon my feet 
And felt as mad as thunder, 
While I 
viewed the coil of rope--
That knocked my pins from under. 
CHORUS. 
Why, what's the matter, 
Why this clatter; 
What has caused this rumpus, play ? 
While I 
was sleeping, 
You were keeping 
This infernal noise all day. 
"NIL DESPERANDUM ." 
Written by M. J. W ILTON. 
KEEP a 
bright face while running a 
race, 
And never think of sorrow ; 
There may be more good things in store 
To greet you on the morrow. 
How great so e'er your troubles are, 
You shouldn't give up hope; 
But do your best, and leave the rest 
For some one else to cope. 
In a 
race to run there's plenty of fun, 
Providing you've got pluck ; 
If you want to win, go boldly in, 
And then just trust to luck. 
Then, never despair, nor tear your hair, 
If things ain't just " so how:" 
Pick up your pail and jump the rail, 
And go for the nearest cow. 
THE IRISHMAN. 
Written for M. MoRnis by J. 
M. 
W ILT011. 
'Tis happy an Irishman ever can be, 
In America, darlin', the land of the free; 
Where whiskey is plenty and money galore, 
While at home we have sometimes the wolf at the door. 
If there's plenty to do, we're always content, 
An' thankful to heaven for what has been sent 
Our conscience is asy, light-hearted au' free, 
No King on his throne more happy than we. 
The Irishman bears on his broad face a 
smile, 
Estranged though he be from Erin's green isle; 
No country born gosRoon ever can be 
More happy than we from the isle of the sea. 
-Unlike other people, no sorrow, no care 
Finds place in our bosoms, light-hearted we are; 
We're happy an' merry as merry could be, 
In America, darlin', the laud o' the free.

THE WRESTLE OF THE CATS . 
Written by JAMES CAMPBELL, and delivered by O' NEIL and CoNnor, 
with shouts of laughter and applause. 
Mns. M ALONEY had a 
cat, and a 
female cat was she, 
Her voice it was a 
soprano, and she sung in the key of G. 
Oh, it was my delight, of a 
starry night, when coining 
home from a 
ball, 
To hear her singing " We met by chalice," on the top of 
Maloney's wall. 
I 
know she went up as high as " G," and sometimes she 
went higher, 
And the way she dwelt on the very last note, you'd think 
she was hollering fire ! 
I 
really think she could say the word fire ! but still I'll 
not swear to that, 
For I 
wouldn't like to make a 
liar of Mrs. Maloney's cat. 
Now, old Mrs. McFadden, she had a 
Tom (a 
cat I 
mean 
by that name), 
And he called Mrs. Maloney's cat a 
most disrespectful 
name. 
Maloney's cat cried out, " You're another!" then Mcs-
Fadden's loudly did bawl, 
" 
You sucker, send out your big brother, or come your-
self over the wall. 
I'll wrestle you, collar and elbow, I'll throw you as quick 
as a 
rat I" 
" 
Arrah, don't be getting your back up !" say Mrs. 
Maloney's cat. 
Now, Jerry McGill had a 
bull dog, and Jerry, he lived in 
the rear, 
And the bull dog was lean, lank, and hungry, and divil 
a 
cat did he fear ; 
Now, Jerry, he called his dog " Boney," says he " Now, 
I'll bet a 
new hat, 
If I 
leave off his chain and his muzzle, he'll make sausage-
meat out of them cats." 
One night (it was dark and dreary, and the divil a 
star 
in the sky), 
Boney had off his chain and his muzzle, and he laid for 
the cats on the sly. 
(1) 
37 
WRESTLE OF THE CATS.—Concluded. 
Now, the cats, they met in the hallway, and they wrestled 
clean out to the yard, 
The first hold was " collar and elbow," and their breath-
ing was terrible hard ; 
Then they both tried " Grieco Roman ;" you couldn't 
te'l who got first fall, 
And Boney was acting as referee in the shade of the gar-
den wall. 
They howled, and they spit, and they sputtered, and tho 
blood from their noses ran, 
Says Boney " I'll take a new hoult, I'll wrestle them 
catch, catch, can." 
Then, like lightning he sprang in amongst them, 
In his jaws he laid one by the back, 
Such a 
yell was ne'er heard in that quarter, 
As came from Maloney's poor eat. 
McFadden cat fought like a 
tiger, 
But lloney's strength didn't him. fail 
With a 
twist of his jaws, like a 
general, 
He bit off McFadden's cat's tail. 
Oh, the howling, mid yelling, and growling of the dog 
and the eats filled the air, 
And the windows all round in the barracks flew open 
everywhere. 
Heads with night-caps of old men and old women and 
children, poked out in the dark, 
They thought that the house was on fire ; or the divil 
was out on a 
lark ; 
They tried to look out in the darkness where the noise 
came from, down by the wall, 
And thinking some one was being murdered, they loud 
for the police did bawl. 
Then they came out in droves and in dozens, 
The children, old women and men, 
With candles, with lamps, and with matches, 
But alt ! what a 
sight met them then— 
McFadden, and Mrs. Maloney 
They sorefullv shook 
th ei
r night-caps, 
To see McGill's bull dog, old Dopey, 
Holding a 
wake over the two defunct cats.

TIIERE's a 
darling and a 
fascinating creature, 
Just as pretty as a

My bright-eyed sweet Elaine.

With joy and love she'd almost set you crazy, (

For her roguish glance and style so neat 
Your words could not describe, 
And ere the leaves begin to turn 
She shall surely be my bride ; 
For my hope and prayer from morn till night 
Shall ever be to gain 
The affections and the winning smiles 
Of bright -eyed sweet Elaine. 
Last evening-, when the moon was softly- beaming, 
We strolled together near the old oak tree ; 
There I 
to:d her that I 
never would forget her, 
And unehangin 2' would my love forever be ; 
That evejag as we parted near the gateway, 
Near the cottage down the quiet little lane, 
There I 
vowed that naught on earth would ever part me 
From bright-eyed sweet Elaine. 
You should gaze, etc.

CARROLL'S BANJO MEDLEY. 
By Wm.. CARROLL. 
I'LL sing of a 
darling just eighteen years old, 
The pride of her dear old ma : 
She lived with her uncle up seven pair of stairs, 
And made chest-protectors for her pa ; 
Her mouth is cut from ear to ear, 
She has the croup just once a 
year. 
With skin so fair it would shame a 
ham, 
She's just as sweet as a 
year- old clam ; 
But she is freckled and she's thin, 
And she's always full of gin, 
And to Salt Lake she has been. 
This Italian, German blonde, 
With all her faults I 
love her ; 
She is all the world to me. 
If I 
could only steal her from the house 
I'd ship her in the queen's navee ; 
But her father keeps his eye on me 
Like a 
cat who is watching a 
mouse. 
There's a 
bull-dog loose about the yard, 
And I 
cannot get near the house ; 
But I 
swore I'd have this girl, 
And I'm going to keep my word 
If I 
have to shoot that ugly dog ;-
I 
will coax him with an anchor or smash him with a 
stick 
If that don't do I'll blow him up with fog ; 
For I'm going to have this girl if a 
million it does cost, 
And if that dog is there then everything is lost. 
I'll see my pretty little girl and make her fly with me, 
We'll cross the ocean in a 
ferry-boat and land in Nor 
Jersey. 
So now, kind folks, I'll leave you, I'm afraid I 
will be 
late, 
I 
promised Maud I'd meet her near the old back garden 
gate. 
I 
am going to ask her father for the hand I 
love so dear, 
And if he don't give his consent we'll slide off on our ear.

" 
DORKINS WAS TIGHT." 
Written by BENJ. D. 
COLLINS. 
Sung by Gus W ILLIAXIS. 
THE theatre was full, and so were the actors, 
Dan Dorkins was going to appear 
That night in a 
bare-footed slack-wire clog, 
For he was the Pompey round here. 
The bar-room was fearfully crowded with beats 
Who awaited a 
pleasant surprise ; 
For they knew they would eat 
When the lunch was set out, 
And they longed for the curtain to risc. 
The curtain arose, and so did the people, 
Who began to shout and hurrah ; 
Dan Dorkins came out with young Oliver Twist, 
But they gave him the laugh and yah ! yah ! 
The play it began when the curtain went up, 
But something was wrong I 
felt sure ; 
" 
He's away off his base," says John Jas. Mansfield, 
That never went back on the poor. 
A 
brick—well it was—I 
saw Dorkins start, 
And carom on the dark red for two ; 
And it made me feel thirsty to see how he worked, 
But continually dropping his cue. 
He says, "I'm the king," when a 
woman jumped up 
Cried, " you lie, for you're one of the gang, 
And you owe me for washing." That knocked Dorking 
cold, 
And his head on his breast did hang. 
At length the footlights he approached with a 
rush, 
And " Ladies and gentlemen," said, 
If I 
haven't drank enough bourbon to-night, 
The fault is my wealth, not my head. 
Many a 
time I 
have made you all sick, 
And get up and go out for a 
beer ; 
'When me and Jim Stokes walked a 
mile in a 
week, 
How I 
wish Dan O'Leary was here. 
You insult me to-night and say I 
am sober, 
For years I've been a 
HP 
mlet alone ; 
tell you the reason, I 
know you will treat,

FAR away in sunny meadows, 
Where the merry sunbeams play'd, 
Oft I 
lingered ' mid the clover, 
Singing to a 
village maid ; 
She was fairer than the fairest, 
Ever faithful, fond, and true ; 
And she wore beneath a 
bonnet, 
Amber tresses tied hi blue. 
cuonus. 
She was fairer than the fairest., 
Ever faithful, fond, and true : 
And she wore beneath a 
bonnet. 
Amber tresses tied in blue. 
Ere the summer days departed, 
We had made a 
solemn vow; 
And I 
never, never wearied 
Kissing her sweet cheek and brow. 
She was dearer than the dearest, 
Pure as drops of morning dew; 
And adown her neck was banging 
Amber tresses tied in blue. 
She was fairer, eta 
'Twas decreed that Fate should part us 
Ere the leaves of autumn fell, 
And two loving hearts were severed, 
That had loved each other well. - 
She was all I 
had to cherish, 
She has bade a 
last adieu, 
And I 
see in ev'ry vision 
Amber tresses tied iz blue. 
She was fairer,

LAY ME WHERE THE BIRDS ARE SINGLNG. 
LAY me where the birds are singing, 
Make my bed in some green spot, 
With white roses o'er me clinging, 
And the sweet forget-me-not ; 
For I 
lov'd each fairy songster, 
And each flower was joy to see; 
Then, oh! lay me 'mid the roses, 
With their white wings over me. 
CHORUS. 
Birds shall sing and buds shall blossom 
Through the ages yet to be; 
Then, oh ! lay me 'mid the roses, 
With their white wings over me, 
Lay me where the birds are singing, 
In the trees that round me wave ; 
I 
would have their music ringing, 
And bright flow'rs around my grave; 
Make no pile of sculptured marble, 
Let my resting only be 
Where the white buds of the roses 
Shed their incense over me. 
Birds shall sing, etc. 
Lay me where the birds are singing 
Songs of springtime o'er my tomb, 
Telling of the free soul winging, 
Where immortal flowers bloom. 
Bud and blossom soft shall whisper 
Of the golden life to be ; 
Then, oh I 
lay me 'mid the roses, 
With their white wings over me. 
Birds shall sing, etc.

NEVER GO BACK ON A FELLOW . 
Written by 31. J. W ILTON. 
W I= 
you meet with a 
friend on the avenue, 
Don't turn your head over that way, 
As if you're afraid that the ladies (God bless them) 
Would turn up their noses this way ; (
imitatc4.) 
But welcome your friend with a 
welcome 
That's born of the heart, warm and true; 
God's blessing will surely attend you, 
And bless everything that you do. 
CHORUS. 
Then never go back on a 
fellow, 
E'en though his garments be plain ; 
He's better, a 
thousand times better, 
Than the man who looks only to gain. 
There may be times when one may need 
The assistance of a 
friend. 
A man to be a 
friend indeed, 
But not to scrape or bend. 
'Tis said woman's heart is a 
riddle, 
One which you never can read; 
But then, in the hour of trial 
She proves herself friendly indeed. 
Then never go back, etc. 
Perhaps you may think yourself better 
Than he who is dressed not so trim; 
His ulster may hide rusty garments, 
But it covers a 
warm heart within. 
Could you look to the licqut of your nehrhbor 
You would see what is manly and true; 
A heart which is full of affection 
For others,—for me, and for you. 
Then never go back, etc. 
Have we not all been created as brothers, 
To help one another in need, 
To bear with one's whims and caprices, 
And prove ourselves friendly indeed ? 
The best and the noblest may sometimes 
Be cast down by sorrow or pain; 
Let yours be the hand that would raise him, 
And restore him his nufuhood again. 
Then never go back, etc. 
DARKEY'S HOLIDAY. 
Good evening whitefolks one and all, 
I've come to make you all a 
call, 
To sing and dance is my delight, 
And throw myself clean out of sight, 
And try to please you all to-night, 
Now that's what's the matter. 
CHORUS. 
So I 
laugh and sing all de day, 
Try to pass de time away, 
Dere's nothing like a 
holiday, 
Upon the old plantation. 
In a 
little log hut in old Virg,inny, 
Dere lives my mother she came from Guinea, 
She said I 
was de only one, 
And my age was twenty one ; 
And now I've just begin to learn,. 
And now that's what is the matter. 
So I 
laugh, ke. 
Way down upon de old plantation, 
Dere's where us darkies work and play, 
Massa cause a 
great sensation, 
All throughout this mighty nation, 
By giving us nigs a 
holiday, 
Now that's what is the matter. 
So I

FUNNY OLD GAL. 
As originally sung by W ILLIAM ASHCEOFT. 
I'm a 
funny old gal and I

The people all say that I'm an old fool, 
But they may all laugh and chair at my pate, 
I'm a

Then all of you sing for this funny old gal, 
All of you sing for this funny old gal, 
All of you sing and don't you be too late, 
For this funny old gal from South Ca'lina State,', 
T'other day, while walking in the street, 
Some naughty little boy say, " how's your poor feet !"

,e'UNNY SIGHTS. 
Wo:ds by FRA7..s:Ii. DUMONT. 
Sung by TOM WARFIELLI. 
I'VE got a 
little song to sing, so open wide your ears, 
I'll tell you of the funny sights I've seen these many 
years ; 
I 
saw a 
bullfrog on a 
fence with an elephant playing tag, 
A 
little dog with his tail so short a 
stump tail he couldn't 
wag, 
saw a 
brickbat hit a 
goat with a 
piece of sour krout, 
I 
saw an egg that hatched a 
mule on a 
spittoon inside out, 
I 
saw enough to make me laugh when I 
saw a 
greenback 
dollar 
Take home a 
drunken pair of boots and a 
policeman by 
the collar. 
Perhaps you think I 
haven't seen a 
hair-pin ride a 
horse, 
Or see a 
steamboat go ashore to drink benzine, of course. 
I 
seen a 
camel chase a 
flea up a 
sour apple tree, 
And play draw poker with an owl so old he couldn't see. 
I 
seen a 
hog whose head was bald, around his head he 
wore a 
wreath, 
I 
511117 a 
bedbug dressed in red with a 
bran new set of 
teeth, 
I 
saw a 
cart wheel in a 
mince pie, and a 
man who never 
wakes, 
And when I 
drank some old benzine I 
saw a 
thousand 
snakes. 
I 
saw a 
sardine smoke a 
pipe, and a 
wash-tub go to bed, 
I 
saw a 
donkey with boxing-gloves standing on his head, 
A 
dish cloth drink a 
pail of milk, and 
a l
obs-ter that would 
not die, 
A 
butterfly with real blonde hair, a 
rat with a 
glass eye. 
I 
seen a 
mosquito kill a 
hog by stepping on Ins ear, 
I 
seen a 
whale take a 
bath in a 
penny glass of beer, 
But the funniest thing I 
ever saw, II remember it to this 
day, 
Was a 
grasshopper without any teeth chewing a bale of 
bay. 
! 
MY JENNIE! OH! SWEET JENNIE! 
Partly written an1 composed by W. II. DELEHANTY. 
Ois ! my Jennie ! Oh ! my Jennie, 
Time flies quickly by ; 
Sure the lanes will have their turnings, 
Tho' the travellers die. 
Mark the swallow's flight, oh, Jennie, 
Pointing to the sky— 
Waiting as my love waits, Jennie, 
Till the clouds go by, 
Looking like my love looks, Jennie, 
Till the clouds of care go by. 
CHORUS. 
Oh ! my Jennie ! 
Oh, sweet Jennie, 
Time flies quickly by ; 
Bear with me in patience, Jennie, 
Till (he clouds go by, 
Bear with me in patience, Jennie, 
Till the clouds of care go by. 
As the dew is to the flowers, 
E'er the sun at morn 
Kisses off its magic power, 
And leaves the rose forlorn, 
So am I 
without thee, Jennie. 
Heavy comes the sigh, 
But prayer will lighten sorrow, Jennie, 
Till the clouds go by; 
Joy will come to-morrow, Jennie, 
When the clouds of care go by. 
Oh may Jennie, etc.

OLD MAN AM DEAD AND GONE. 
Performed with great success all over the country by BARLOW, 
W ILSON, PRIMROSE & W EST'S Minstrels. 
I 
LTVED in old Virginny for many, many years, 
And worked among the cotton and corn ; 
Old massa he was good and kind, it filled my eyes with 
tears, 
nebber see his good old face any more. 
The rumiticum cotched me, my limbs are getting weak, 
It bent me over like the yaller corn. 
I 
wonder if thar's any one will shed a 
silent tear 
When this poor old man am dead and gone.

Now dar's de good ole missie, she was ebbrir kind 
To please her was my very heart's delight ; 
But death did know no tokens, it took her off one day, 
And now she living with the angels bright. 
The old plantation's changed about, the boy am

No more shall hoe de green and yadler corn ; 
And I

And soon from toil and sorrow I'll be free ; 
But here I

'With no one left to cheer me while 1

JUST BEHIND THE SCENES. 
As sung by Gus .W1LLIAMS. 
Words and Music by FRED ALBERT. 
The Music of this Song is published by E. H. 1.1.uturwc, 223 Bowery, If ew 
York. 
Price 10 cents. 
W HEN but a 
little boy, oh, it really was my joy, 
To visit the Theatre I'll admit. 
How happy I 
could be, the performances to see, 
While seated in the gallery or pit. 
I 
fancied all was real that the curtain did reveal, 
But since that I 
have pass'd beyond my teens, 
I 
begin to understand, tho' in front it may look grand, 
'Tis very diffrent just ' Behind the Scenes." 
So if you will attend for a 
moment now, my friends, 
I'll do the best within my humble means, 
To show to you to-night, tho' in front it may look bright, 
'Tis very diffrent just ' Behind the Scenes." 
The comedian is one who while causing lots of fun. 
His heart may yet hang heavy in his breast, 
And the man who plays the king, tho' it seems a 
curioug 
thing, 
In private may be very poorly chest. 
The Ladies too—so fair, who go floating through the air , 
And look like little angels there instead, 
Sometimes have to roam unto a 
wretched home, 
And oftentimes go supperless to bed ; 
While those who play the parts of the men with stony 
hearts, 
And look as if their tempers were like fiends, 
Could yon see them while away, you'd very likely say, 
They're the mildest looking men " Behind the Scenes." 
'Tis just the same in life, for what lots of care and strife, 
And suL,ering some folks will. undergo, 
Just to zut a 
shine, and to make themselves look fine, 
And think of nothing else but outside show ; 
(1) 
57 
JUST BEHIND THE SCEINES.—Concluded. 
They fancy and sppose that those who wear good clothes 
Always look the richest and the best ; 
But an honest heart and mind is respected most you'll find, 
No matter whether poor or richly drest. 
Still many one you know have caused themselves much 
woe, 
Through trying hard to live beyond their means, 
And though they wear a 
smile, yet really all the while 
They are very wretched just " Behind the Scenes." 
There's many a 
married pair, I've no doubt you are aware, 
Who in public are so tender and so kind, 
But could you only see them at home in privacy, 
A 
very differont state of things you'd find. 
Sometimes it is the wife who's the cause of all the strife ; 
Sometimes it is the lmsband who's to blame, 
Let that be how it may who causes all the fray, 
Their quarrelling continues just the same. 
Yet still they try to hide, from all the world outside, 
The snarls and jars with which their household teems, 
And often when you hear them call each other dear, 
They hate each other just " Behind the Scenes." 
The wealthy and the great, who can ride about in state, 
And have a 
host of wealth at their command, 
Have, you may be sure, as many troubles to endure 
As those who are the humblest in the land I 
For England's greatest sage says all the world's a 
stage, 
And etell of us endeavor all our might., 
Oar follies to conceal, and only to reveal 
That which is most pleasing to the sight. 
No matter where you go, from the highest to the low, 
From peasantry right up to kings and queens, 
Whatever they enjoy there's something to annoy, 
If we could only see " Behind the Scenes."

OLD AUNT HANNAH. 
Sung by J01111 
Orn old man went in to swim, 
Hung his clothes on a 
hickory limb, 
The limb it broke, and he fell in, 
Slap into the water. 
The old man for me did shout, 
For to come and pull him out, 
I 
grabbed the old man by the snout, 
And busted his suspenders.

Says that he'll have lots of fun, 
Says he'll go to Washington 
To see the President. 
The old man fell in the old hog pen, 
The old hog she did root him then, 
He says, " old woman, you snoring again ?" 
He thought it was aunt Hannah.

BILLY'S DREAM BOOK. 
As suny by BILLY BIRCH at the San Francisco Minstrels' Opera House, 
Broadway and 29th street. 
SOME people say that dreams have their signs and mean-
ings too, 
And I'll prove they're not wrong altogether ; 
If you dream of a 
bald-headed alligator's ghost, 
it's a 
sign that your nose will get redder ; 
If you dream you're eating mush, or you're chewing a 
cord of wood, 
It's a 
sign that you'll soon have the horrors or the shakes ; 
If you dream a 
cross-eye'd cat plays a 
yellow clarionet, 
You're lucky if you do no find your boots are full of 
" 
snakes." 
Oh, be careful how you dream and remember ev'ry sign, 
For ev'ry dream I've told you, I've experienced in my 
mind. 
I 
dreamed that stocks were up and I 
bought a 
thousand 
shares, 
I 
was shaving with an old paper collar, 
And hungry Doctor Tanner was mixing up the lather, 
'Twas a 
sign that I'd win every dollar. 
Jay Gould he gave me a " put," and Russell Sage a " call," 
I 
played it for a " full " to be healthy in the fall. 
I 
threw my " margin " freely, and I 
bought 'em with a 
dash, 
My margin in the morning had shrunk to a 
plate of bash. 
Oh, be careful, etc. 
If you dream you comb your hair with a 
shovel or a 
rake, 
ion wake up and find yourself a-lying on the floor ; 
It's a 
sign of a 
fight, and the slathering you'll get, 
If you dare to say " boo I " to your mother-in-law. 
ff a 
lady dreams a 
flea lifts a 
camel by the ear, 
ar a 
frog's wearing spectacles pretending that he's blind, 
it's a 
sign that her husband will buy her a 
sealskin sacque, 
A. new bonnet, diamond ear- rings, all in clusters,—in his 
mind. 
Oh, be careful, etc.

THE APOLOGY TO O'REILLY% 
NOT a 
hundred yards from where I 
stand, 
In this our glorious Union land, 
Is kept a 
first-class liquor stand 
By a 
man whose name's O'Connor. 
There's a 
man who's known both near and far, 
Who attends to Mike O'Connor's bar ; 
Who, in our late war received no sear, 
And his name it is O'Reilly. 
Beneath our banner's starry wave, 
There's not a 
man fought half so brave, 
Or half the money for whiskey gave, 
As did McDermott. 
O'Connor's bar-room blazed with light 
On that eventful, bloody night 
That McDermott had the fearful fight 
With O'Reilly. 
With sleeves rolled up McDermott stood, 
And vowed he'd die before he would 
Say the slightest word that could, 
In any manner, be misconstrued 
Into an apology to O'Reilly. 
With a 
frowning brow and flashing eye, 
O'Reilly collared a 
glass of rye, 
Which he devoured without a 
sigh, 
Then turning to McDermott, said, 
" 
You alchoholic vat, you drunken loon ! 
You've no more sense than a 
gossoon !" 
"Be Heavens ! 
I'll make you change your tune," 
Says McDermott. 
McDermott went for O'Reilly's nose, 
And on it planted fearful blows, 
Till o'er his eye a 
shanty rose, 
Erected by McDermott. 
O'Reilly fell into a 
swoon, 
With his head jammed in a 
big spittoon, 
And dreaming of Barnum's big balloon, 
The poline came in and collared the gang.
