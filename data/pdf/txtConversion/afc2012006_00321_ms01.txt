RICHARD BLUDWORTH 
 
00:00:26 
Born in Houston in 1948, Dad and uncle operated tugs and barges on the Houston Ship 
channel. Started in business after WW 2. Built their own boat. Built own boats and barges 
till the 1990s. Have two children, One in San Antonio, the other in Hawaii.  
 
00:01:34 
Family came over from England in early 1800s.  Moved from Louisiana to Rockport, TX. 
Just raising children, fishing, mechanical work, rebuilding a few boats. Raised 7-8 
children. Moved stayed involved in boat operations. Father grew up in Galveston- 
Houston area, served in WW2. After that he and his brother built a boat from a landing 
craft. Took the landing craft hull and built a tug boat out of it. Decks, and houses. 
additional engines etc. Used the extra engines to push barges with.  
 
00:05:31 
Built boats and operated boats. They operated barges for themselves. Self taught, 
entrepreneurial and had creative minds. Eventually went out of business and sold all the 
equipment and retired out of the business. 1946 through early 90s. By the time they had a 
a business in the 90s, there was a considerable amount of regulation in the industry than 
when they started. When they started it was all almost unregulated. Had 3-4 ocean tugs 
and ocean barges that transported mostly bulk liquids in US and foreign trade. Traveling 
all the way to South America, Africa, Europe. Did not ever build boats for others.  
 
00:09:07 
3-4 brothers or cousins that started Bludworth Shipyard on Brady's Island after the war 
and they built boats for others. Were in business during the same time period. All friendly 
competitors. Most of the ship yards are still friendly.  
 
00:11:18 
Dad and uncle worked for Bud Adams, Dow Chemical, Worked on small jobs every 
summer from 14 years of age. Then, boats were still running inland, from Sweeney, TX 
to Corpus CHristi. Would load barges with crude oil, discharge oil. Was assigned to do 
the same work everyone else was doing. No special treatment as the owners son. Worked 
from 14 up through high school, was out of business for 8 years and got back in the late 
70s.  
 
00:14:36 
Went to Texas Tech, in Lubbock, TX. Degree in business and worked for Continental 
Airlines. Then went back to work for Dad and Uncle. Then had 30-40 people. Was in 
charge of running, crewing and maintaining and handling regulatory business on 3-4 
ocean tug units. Did everything but deal directly with the customer.  
 
 
 
 
 
00:16:45 
Uncle got into financial trouble, had to declare bankruptcy, took the company down, was 
dismantled, went to work for another marine transportation company in the early 90s. 
Worked for Martin Gas Marine, Acquired offshore equipment. Always had side 
businesses. White working for Martin Gas, ex employees of father  needed work .Put 
them to work doing misc repairs for companies including Martin Marine, Started 
Bludworth Marine while working for Martin Marines. Left after 2 years. Martin Marine 
owns boats and barges, Bludworth Marine repairs boats and barges.  
 
00:20:31 
Started the company with a few people doing odd jobs, Built the company from a half 
million to 5 million and then started over in Houston, running about a half million a year 
in sales. Work on inland tugs, offshore tugs and barges, ships, do a lot of work on 
pumping and machinery, rotating machinery, overhaul pumps, build connection systems, 
represent a Japanese company that builds articulated tug barge units.  
 
00:23:11 
Business is cyclical, transportation and repair side either very good or very bad. Not 
much in between. Have tied it to the auto and housing industry, Recent year US inventory 
has affected it. Housing and Auto drives Plastic and production, petroleum and 
chemicals, that moves marine equipment and repairs. Inland barges only trade in 
protected waters - rivers, bays, lakes etc. Small waves, not a lot of winds, they connect 
with wires and ropes. Offshore equipment is towed on a long wire. Wench on stern of the 
boat, long wire that stretched out to the barge and then pulled the barge from the stern of 
the boat. Connection system is mechanical,  
 
00:25:35 
In the 1970s, both Dad and uncle built a connection system that they patented, 
engineered, designed, built and sold. Then only other commercial system was the Arta 
couple system built in Japan. Only viable systems. Some other reconnection systems did 
quite well and command a large percent of the market now. 2000- another system 
developed by the Finnish - Scandinavian company that developed a system that has done 
well in the market. 4 major companies producing articulated tug barge system.  
 
00:27:35 
Physical layout and the equipment in each o the sites and the experience of people 
running the site really drives the customers. Variety of factors that produce the kind of 
work a location can do. All share insurance, admin, overhead, risks and employee base to 
keep all of them functioning as efficiently as possible. Allowed to compete in a way lot 
of other people don't. Still do a lot o topside on sight repair work. Send out mobile crews 
on a regular basis. Never dropped that niche.  
 
 
 
 
 
00:29:27 
Focal point in this business has been the degree of experience that is present in the org. 
(Talks about people who have worked with company for years). 
 
00:32:43 
No master shipbuilders. Marine engineers and naval architects. Taken the place of master 
builders. some have engineering training. Most employee are self taught. Most do not 
have college education. But very good at what they do. That is changing rapidly. Very 
few people stay in the business for long. Some people go to school and specialize in 
marine engineering or architecture that like ships at sea and vessels and take engineering 
knowledge and apply it. Don't have enough young people looking for them. Trying to 
train some young people.  
 
00:35:11 
Training programs. Locally, Galveston A&M, is a marine training college. A few 
colleges on the East Coast have provided most of the Marine professionals in the last 30 
years. Most of the high school program shave been funded by people within the industry. 
Huge business base that revolves around the port and water transportation. Hidden 
industry because of all the regulations and security. LEarning the business has become 
that much more difficult. Learning about the industry and the opportunities now is more 
difficult.  
 
00:37:00 
TWIC card. Transportation worker Identification Card was a knee jerk reaction out of 
9/11 to control security at airports that nobody used. Still need aport security card to take 
other people in. Additional cards that are necessary and need to be maintained. Some 
places need three cards to get in. Cab drivers, container operators, forklift operators, all 
need to get a TWIC. Everyone that wants to go to the POrt of Houston needs a card, but 
also needs to have a POrt of Houston card and a place specific card.  
 
00:39:21 
Wanted to fly jets, when eyes went bad, opted out of the air force. Ended up with a 
business degree. Helped dad and uncle with the job. THats how ended up at the Port.  
 
00:40:29 
Bought first used dry dock 5 years ago. Hurricane Ike put three waterfronts under water, 
destroyed equipment, no sales for three months. Started dry dock in 2009. Launched in 
2010. two dry docks in Orange. Bigger boats means bigger jobs means more income in 
the same period of time. different pieces of equipment to handle different sizes of vessels.  
 
00:42:40 
Sites are spread out because it is hard to find real estate. Prices are very high. Business 
does not generate enough volume to competitively use that property. Deep water access 
 
 
 
 
land is expensive because of access and prices are not feasible. Land in Channel view 
was relatively inexpensive until recently. Lot of waterfront area, all in old run down 
neighborhoods which meant reduced pricing, more practical. Problem with CHannelview 
is water is very shallow, Cant get a deep draft vessel. Limited to working with inland 
boats and barges.  
 
00:45:10 
Todd Galveston, closing down in the 80s. Marine repair work. Houston - public land in 
the Houston ship channel and there is private land. Port of Orange, very pro industry, 
brought  lot of business to them. Had a lot of unused property and was able to fit the mold 
that they were looking for. Leased property from Port of Port Arthur. Lucrative and 
efficient jobs. 350ft vessel in Houston or Galveston will cost $3-5 per foot per day.  
 
00:48:05 
Go to Galveston, Houston, Port Arthur, Orange, and lease dock space, bring a ship in, do 
the job and put the rent in the job, customer willing to pay it. Thus competing with larger 
shipyards. Mobilize and demobilize.  
 
00:50:55 
In 2005, ship was offloading steel ingots. Ingots were 40 ft long, 8 in thick and 6ft wide. 
Chain broke and ingot fell, punched a hole through the cargo tank and was lodged like a 
knife blade. Got a call for some pumps. Took some pumps down there at 5pm. By 
midnight was able to come up with a repair scheme and got the job. 3-4 weeks repairing.  
2009 - gone 3 months without work, Hurricane Ike had destroyed all facilities. In January 
was able to talk to some people on a container ship. Put some pricing together at Port 
Arthur. Ship came in a week later and three weeks later had completed the work. THis 
entailed moving entire workforce to Port Arthur, set up a catering service, work two 
shifts around the clock for 4 weeks. Million dollar job. Rented the port from the Port of 
Port Arthur, rented dock space, rented the Port owned crane for heavy container lids. 
Large onsite job.  
 
00:54:52 
Ike put Houston and the Golden Triangle under water. Very unusual to see such a large 
area under water. 3-4ft of water. Lost equipment, infrastructure, filled in some holes for 
dry docking, just started Orange facility. Took clean up crews a week to clear the debris. 
Hundreds of snakes. Had 150 employees. Kept most employees. Up until then had 5 yr. 
double digit growth. Had a nice cushion of cash. Then economic downturn, BP oil spill. 
Went from a 170 people to 40 people. Almost all hourly welders and fitters were gone. 
Kept the entire management and admin staff.  Managed to ride it through till business 
started coming back.  
 
00:59:00 
 
 
 
 
Work with very low insurance. Did not apply for Hurricane insurance. Could have 
applied for BP money. Chose not to. "Basically against government handouts but will 
take it if they put it front of me."  
 
01:03:23 
Ocean transportation is one of more efficient ways to move large amounts of products. 
As long as economy is running, going to need it. Probably will be one of the last 
industries to shut down. In the Marine repair business, company is in the 25 percent 
percentile. There are some smaller businesses. Very low margin business. Unique aspect, 
there are multiple small locations. Most other yards don’t do it. Constantly looking for 
niches to get into. Entered the pump repair business 5 yrs ago, had a change to hire some 
people. Built a good business around that. Blasters and painters. Instead of adding 
locations, been adding specialties. Orange is the most versatile. Channelview is inland 
tugs and inland barges. Houston - pumps are headquartered in Houston. Do some 
fabrication work. Crane pedestal being built.  
 
01:10:40 
220 people in workforce. 30 admin support people. Offshore on boat, live on boat and 
pay per diem. Private launches to get people in and out to boats. Will get supplies and 
equipment also. Ship concierge. Folklore name. Derogatory term because very difficult 
the action. have not been very successful getting business through agents.  
 
01:16:58 
Agent relationship. Competitor used to work for cousins. Started a business, based on one 
company, knows one port engineer, every time a vessel comes to Houston, knows 3-4 
people who go down to the vessel. Entire company of 4-5 people working for one 
customer, one port engineer.  
 
01:20:00 
Vessels come and go, trading patterns change. Have done a dozen jobs at one time and 
never worked for those people again. Most business is with repeat customers. Most of the 
growth is from getting additional repeat customers. Top customers - Martin Gas Marine, 
Crawley Maritime out of Seattle. Have not built any new boats, only barges. Have not 
built tugs. More difficult to do and get a profit out of.  
 
01:24:35 
Southwest Shipyard. Sanjay Rao part owner of Southwest Shipyard. Built three boats for 
Martin Marine. Story of Southwest Shipyard. Tough competitor.  (Paused tape) 
 
01:27:42 
One of the most unusual things about the port industry is how small the world really is 
and how many people you can run into over and over again. (Pause tape at 01:33:36) 
 
 
 
 
 
(Tape resumes) 
01:33:36 
Houston has a lot of good business. Daughter is in the police force in San Antonio and 
son is an FBI agent. But both have agreed to be a part of the Board.  
 
01:39:00 
Love the industry, fascinated while growing up. Had a great time hanging around the ship 
yard. Big boats, big toys. Fascinating business. People that do get in do not get out.  
 
(PAUSE TAPE) 
(RESUME TAPE) 
01:40:12 
Talking about the environment in the Houston ship channel, water quality and air quality. 
At 4-5, knew a person who used ot stay on his houseboat from time to time. He had a cat 
that fell overboard. Cat's skin burned off his body and had raw burn spots all over its 
body. Somewhere around 1950s. Ten years ago they had manatees swimming in the 
water. AN example of how much Houston ship channel has cleaned up in the last few 
years. Earlier could hardly breathe because of the sulphur fumes that used to waft from 
Brady's Island in the 60s.  
 
01:44:00 
Shanghai reds. Also Greek restaurant off Clinton Drive - Athens Bar and Grill. Greeks 
off the ships used to dance on the tables. Could get marinated octopus to eat. Hickory 
Stick Barbecue where people in the marine industry went for lunch everyday, Dinner Bell 
restaurant. Very small cafeterias. Right across the street from Dinner Bell was Chuck 
Wagon. Got torn down only three years ago. San Jacinto Inn. Monument Inn. On 
Telephone Road - place called Pressure Cooker because ladies would put the food in 
pressure cookers so they could hang out at the spot all day.
