Introduction: Mary Hoefferle interviewing elementary art teacher Tim 
O’Loughlin at Read Elementary School in Oshkosh, Wisconsin on December 16, 2013. Tim read 
and signed the release form. 
00:00:24 
Number of years teaching and educational background: five at elementary and 
four at both elementary and high school. Four year college degree from UW Oshkosh. 
Professional development plan every five years (PI 34 requirement). 
00:02:05 
Typical day: arrives at 7:30. Prepare materials for the day. Each day, he teaches 
all grade levels (k-5) in one day. Classroom is in the basement, so he does not socialize with 
other teachers in the morning. Class begins at 8:00 with no time between classes. Teaches 
four classes, then 45-minute lunch. Runs home for lunch, let the dog out. Gets back to school 
to clean up from the morning and set up for the last two classes. Last class ends at 2:30 and 
teacher contract day ends at 3:15. Music teacher says hello, but otherwise only short 
interaction with classroom teachers in between class.  
00:05:35 
Weekly schedule: Travels to three schools during the week. Teaches 26 
different classes during the week. Full time most years but went down to 80 percent time for 
two years due to student numbers.  
00:07:14 
Other duties: The elementary art teachers are trying to draft a document to 
outline duty expectations. Tim has five duties – bus, recess, and after school duty. 
00:08:14 
Benefits of the job: Tim likes everything about his work. Likes working with kids, 
art is one of his passions. 
00:08:48 
Desired changes for the job: an extra sink. Two sinks on opposite sides of the 
room. More money would be nice, too. 
00:09:27 
Relationships with other faculty: He tries to make time to find out what 
classroom teachers are teaching at each grade level and then he finds children’s books to 
incorporate into his art curriculum. Staff meetings once a month with set agendas, which 
usually deal with literacy and math, occasionally with technology. He’s on the technology 
team, so they are videotaping teachers describing a book they like and give summary of 
favorite books – put the video on district website.

Collaboration with other art teachers: Tim’s wife is an elementary art teacher, 
so he has lots of collaboration time with her. He meets once a month with other art teachers. 
Build up art website with lesson plans, power points to share, on-line art show featuring work 
from a different school each month. 
 
00:13:15 
Relationship with administration and other staff: Tim is pleased with the School 
Board and its decisions given the tight financial situation of the district. Principals are very 
open and willing to help, but he never asks for much. Custodians are awesome, share tools. 
One custodian brought in scraps of leather.  
 
00:15:18 
Parental involvement: Tim teaches nearly 500 students so has very little contact 
with parents. He sends home a newsletter to ask for ice cream buckets, paper towel tubes. 
Some parents always thinking of him and donate materials. No parent volunteers in the room. 
 
00:16:35 
Job-related jokes: At staff meetings, teachers offer funny stories about 
students. More camaraderie with other art teachers.  
 
00:18:22 
Memorable students: Kindergarteners are always funny. When teaching them, 
they are thinking about other things. When he asked for questions after a lesson, one student 
looked at his arms and said, “You have really furry arms.” 
 
00:19:46 
Gender issues: As a male teacher, he never is alone with a child in the room. He 
doesn’t think much about his gender, doesn’t feel lonely being one of only a few men in the 
entire school. 
 
00:20:54 
Stereotypes of art teacher: When he tells people he is an art teacher, they think 
it’s pretty cool and they always wonders what his house looks like. If they come over and look 
at the art on the walls, they always want to know if he painted it. 
 
00:21:37 
Fairness: Tim feels he is treated fairly by staff and other art teachers. They have 
no say over teaching schedules. Administrators do try to keep them at their home school 
every year and just vary the second and/or third schools.  
 
00:23:30 
Changes in the job over the last nine years. The budget shrinks and everything 
costs more. Principals give them $4.50 per child a year. It was almost double that a few years 
ago. Local companies donate paper. Student population hasn’t changed too much. Mostly 
Caucasian students, a few Hmong in each class, only about 10 African Americans in the whole 
school. Kindergarten students seem to be getting crazier, lots of behavior issues. Shorter 
attention spans. 
 
00:30:17 
Teacher unions: Tim votes more due to the dismantling of the unions in the 
state. He’s not that politically involved. He just accepts whatever the district gives him (pay 
and insurance). The district is figuring out the salary scale.

Technology: Computer projectors and screens are essential. Before, we had to 
pull out all these posters. The projector makes it easier and nicer. He doesn’t use computers 
as digital art media. Has iPads available but doesn’t use them even though he is on the 
technology team. He and his wife teach a claymation unit during summer school using 
computers every other summer.  
 
00:35:50 
Advice for new teachers: Try to be organized. Lots of art teachers are not that 
organized. It makes your life easier.
