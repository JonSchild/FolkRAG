[Letter from John A. Lomax to Edward N. Waters]
Port Aransas, Texas, 1/24/ 1 939
Dear Mr. Waters:
Please reply to the enclosed letter, or, as it is official, hand it over to Mr. Spivacke.
The Cowboy Songs must be selling some or else there would be no special circular.
I thought you would be interested in some of the comments on the music. Not an
unfavorable line yet.
Did the children get my Christmas verses? I pictured you reading them aloud on Christmas
morning.
Maybe I'll be looking in on you in a few months or so.
In the next edition of Cowboy Songs (to come soon) I am insisting that your name come on
the title page as music editor. You might send to Miss Susan at Macmillans just the form
you wish printed.
Fishing here is the best in the world. My average for an afternoon â€” 40 pounds.
With my very kindest regards to the Waters' clan, in toto, believe me always.
Sincerely yours, Jo hn A. Lomax
