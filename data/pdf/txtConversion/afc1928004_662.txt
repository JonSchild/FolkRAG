No doubt you've heard of stolen kisses, 
But that is not of what I 
sing, 
And if you give me your bright glances, 
I'll show 'tis not the pigeon wing. 
My song is of a 
lovely littld maiden, 
A 
charming captivating little miss; 
And the first thing that I 
noticed, 
Was her pretty little rosy lips. 
CHORUS. 
She is the sweetest flower,

I 
could see her every hour, (Break.) 
When first I 
did beheld her, (Break.) 
She caught my heart right from the start, 
With her pretty little rosy lips. 
I 
often meet this little maiden, 
While strolling down beside the sea; 
And soon I'll ask her if she'll haee mek 
And then so happy I 
will be. 
So now adieu, for soon I'must be leaving, 
I 
never shall forget this hour of bliss, 
And whene'er you kiss your sweetheart, 
Think of pretty little rosy lips.

One summer morn while rambling 
Down through the fields so green; 
Where hawthorn blossoms gently blow, 
I 
met Alice Aileen. 
So flaxen were her ringlets, 
Her eyes of Heavenly blue, 
So laughing and bewitching, 
Like a 
dart they pierced me through. 
CHORUS. 
- 
When rosy May comes in with flowers; (Break) 
To deck her gay green spreading bowers; (Break.) 
It's there I 
love to roam, 
With her my little bright sunbeam, 
She is my life, my guiding star, 
My sweet Alice Aleen. 
In a 
shady nook far down the lane, 
In love's sweet peaceful bower, 
Beside a 
crystal falling stream, 
Oh! what a 
happy hour. 
'Tis there she whispered, 
I'll be thine, I 
love, I 
love but thee; 
And murmured low, when we are wed, 
So happy I 
will be.

DEW DROPS ON THE ROSES 
SONG AND DANCE. 
• 
SUNG BY MISS LIZZIE DERIOUS. 
'I wandered in the twilight, 
One lovely night in June; 
My heart was full of delight, 
Delight of summer moon. 
The air was full of fragrance, 
Where orange blossoms blow; 
But nothing was so beautiful, 
As the dew-drops on the rose. 
CHORUS. 
I 
love the fragrance of the morn, 
When sweet birds sing their lays; 
And where the dew drops glittering, 
Sends back the stars sweet rays. 
I 
love to roam in Summer time, 
Where sparkling waters flows, 
And kiss while fioweretts sweetly sleep, 
The dew drops on the rose, 
I 
live again in olden years, 
The loving hearts are true; 
And when I 
crushed beneath my feet, 
With careless tread, the dew. 
And when I 
whispered in his ear, 
'Tis what, he only knows; 
And for a 
diamond bright he took, 
A 
dew drop from the rose. 
Chorus. 
LOVE AT CONEY ISLE, 
WRITTEN FOR AND SUNG BY MISS LIZZIE DERIOUO. 
At Coney Isle, 'twas there, 
One lovely summer's day, 
I 
met a 
maiden fair, 
Who stole my heart away. 
In bathing so neat, 
And swimming with the rest, 
I 
then beheld a 
lovely maid 
Who since my heart blessed. 
CHORUS. 
While swimming in the surf, 
While swimming in the surf, 
met her there with flowing hair, 
While swimming in the surf, 
In bathing suit so neat, 
And pretty little feet, 
With lots of style at Coney Isle, 
While swimming in the surf. 
I 
asked then and there, 
If she would tell her name; 
She said she did not care, 
If I 
would do the same. 
tilo now the day is named, 
I'll happy be for life, 
For soon 
bless the hour, 
When I 
can claim her-for my wife.

A 
maiden dressed in pink and blue, 
Was standing at the door. 
Her rosy cheek; they were so swect, 
Her eyes shone bright and gay, 
And on her bosom rested neat, 
A 
rose perfumed bouquet. 
I 
raised my hat she bowed her head, 
Soon by her side I 
stood; 
And then sweet loving words were said, 
That made my heart feel good.

One day while standing by her side, 
I 
thought I 
would confess; 
I 
asked my love to be my bride, 
She softly whispered " yes," 
Her answer filled me with new life, 
It made me glad and gay, 
To know that she would be my wife, 
My rose perfumed bouquet. 
Now in a 
cottage of our own, 
One painted white and gray, 
I 
dwell in peace and love alone; 
With my rose perfumed bouquet.

In a 
shady little nook close beside a 
running brook, 
Far across the sea on dear old Erin's shore, 
In a 
cottage fives my love where the birds 
sing sweet above, 
And the shamrocks grow in plenty round the door, 
'Tis her pretty face is bright as the stars that 
shine at night, 
And her pleasant smile the sweetest ever seen; 
She's as happy as the lark from daylight until dark, 
Oh I 
I 
fondly love my own, my dear colleen. 
CHORUS. 
She will gladly welcome me when her pretty face I 
see, 
For when I 
land on Erin's shore so green, 
Then the happiest hour to me in all my life will be, 
When I'm wedded to my own, my dear colleen. 
She has eyes of perfect blue, she has cheeks 
of rosy hue, 
And a 
wealth of pleasant sunbeams in her smile; 
She has such a 
roguish face and her every 
move is grace, 
While her voice is like the song of birds the while. 
In a 
little rustic cot she shall share my happy lot, 
And the birds o'er head shall sing their joyous lay, 
And the flowers shall bloom so sweet then 
with earthly joys complete,. 
We shall pass our lives in sunshine bright and gay.

COMIC BANJO SOLO.

COPYRIGHT 1881, 331* MRS. PAULINE LIEDER. 
When I 
was a 
lad about sixteen, 
I 
travelled with a 
circus and sold ice cream; 
I 
polished up the handle of the elephants trunk, 
And slept in a 
cage with a 
big sick monk. (Brea.) 
I 
done my work in such a 
rage, 
They made me ruler of the monkey's cage; 
I 
fed them on the European plan, 
And they got so weak they could not stand. 
When the show would commence, I'd watch for beats, 
With a 
club I'd sail round under the seats; 
My legs got crooked and my back got bent, 
Watching for kids sneaking under the tent. ( Break. 
I 
said " what, never," to a 
mule in fun, 
And got kicked through the roof of the big bass drum, 
It wasn't the fall that made me kick, 
But stopping quite so sudden made me sick. 
They brought me to, with a 
kerosene pump, 
And the doctor said I 
was off my chump, 
They laid me out on the trick mule's back, 
And I 
went through the roof when he took up 
the slack. (Break.) 
Orme down head first, and went clean through a 
dray, 
The horse got frightened and he ran away; 
My voice got broke and my face got scarred. 
And now I'm door-tender in a 
big grave yard.

Only to hear her voice once more! 
No sweeter one was ever heard; 
She was my life my guiding star, 
Charming and as gentle as a 
bird. 
Could I 
but only hear her accent sweet, 
Oft it made this heart of mine rejoice; 
Those happy days fore'er have gone, 
Never more I'll hear her voice. 
CHORUS. 
Only to hear her voice once more, 
Oft I 
heard it in happy days of yore, 
ITwould make this heart of mine rejoias, 
Only to hear her voice. 
In dreams I 
hear her voice so soft, 
What boundless joy it brings to me 
Why did my hopes so soon decay, 
And my only treasure from me flee. 
Could not my lot in life have easier been, 
Why was she so soon the angel's choice, 
Alas I 
from earth her spirit's flown, 
Never more I'll hear her voice.

IT DON'T BELONG TO ME, 
When I 
was but a 
little child I 
used to go to school, 
And there I 
was so very good, they thought I 
was a 
fool; 
Because I 
never claimed a 
thing that didn't belong to me, 
For I 
was just as honest and as truthful as could be. 
While walking cut the other day by a 
police man 
I 
was stopped, 
He says young man this piece of gold just from 
your pocket dropped;• 
But as I 
never carried one, and had but little coin, 
Like an honest boy I 
did reply the purse it is not mine. 
CHORUS. 
No it don't belong to me, it don't belong to me, 
You had better inquire of somebody higher, 
it don't belong to me, 
I 
never saw the purse before, it can't be mine you see, 
I 
know nothing whatever about the purse, 
it don't belong to me. 
My wages being very small I 
live in humble style, 
But with the girls I 
lardy dah, among the great and fine 
I 
tell them almost anything, for I 
have plenty cheek, 
But little they think I 
do the swell upon five 
dollars a 
week. 
The other day I 
bought a 
pie, I 
placed it in my hat, 
I 
saw a 
lady on the street, I 
knew she'd stop to chat, 
My hat blew off, the pie fell out, the little boys 
, 
laughed with glee, 
But when they brought it back I 
said it don't 
belong to me. 
Chorus. 
I 
occupy an attic room in a 
street away up town, 
And in the next there lives a 
girl her name is 
Nelly Brown, 
Whenever I 
get a 
chance to talk or pass the time away, 
I 
have a 
little gossiping in a 
quiet sort of way. 
As I 
came home the other night oh ! what a 
dreadful scene, 
The landlord rushing after me saying, Bill, 
what does us mean, 
Miss Brown has left behind this infant as you see, 
Says I, you quite surprise me, sir, but it don't 
belong to me.

I 
sang in praise of kisses, 
As a 
soft and gentle hint, 
And soon upon my lips, my by. 
A 
greeting did imprint; 
But while intoxicated 
With its measure deep of bliss, 
Alas! my mamma witness was, 
Of our delicious kiss. 
"An explanation I 
demand," 
I 
heard_ to my dismay, 
And in such trembling accents then, 
I 
ventured this to say.

I 
couldn't help it, ma, 
I 
really couldn't ma; 
He spoke so sweet, and said, 
I 
was his guiding star. 
He showy d 
kisses fast, 
When no one else was nigh, 
I 
couldn't ski t) 
his kiSses, ma, 
And didn't care to try. 
Of kisses of all sorts and kinds, 
I've surely had my share, 
From fortntel kiss of friendship, ''•••• 
To love's salutation rare; 
But of them all I'm free to own, 
The sweetest one by far, 
Was the first kiss of love which ope'd 
The eyes of my mamma. 
Her voice how quick our dream did change, 
From pleasure unto pain, 
Ah! bow I 
faltered, when in tears 
I 
softly did explain.

We .were born in a 
little mud cabin, 
With the roof all covered with moss, 
Where the grunt of the pigs in the morning, 
Kept harmony with the old hoss'. 
When a 
child we were fed upon praties, 
But .now we've rose to manhood's estate, 
We 
are known on the street by each one that we meet, 
As the " Carney's," Pat and Dennis so neat. 
CHORUS. 
We come from Killarney by the lakeside, 
Where the lads and lassies on the jaunting car ride, 
We're Pat and Dennis Carney from the lakes 
of sweet Killarney, 
In the land where the apple praties grow. 
In a 
steamship we sailed 'cross the ocean, 
To better our fortunes you see, 
But divil a 
bit of luck have we had here, 
We're as wretched as wretched can be. 
We sigh for the turf-pile so cheerful, 
When barefoot we trudged it afar, 
O'er mountains and hills, cross valleys and rills, 
it the land of sweet " Erin go brut.'

I 
am hard up, you don't know me, 
For my clothes am tat'r'd and torn, 
My parents died when I 
was young, 
I'm forsaken, dislikd and forlorn. 
I've travTd this country thro' and thro,' 
On the road and on the rail, 
My limbs are getting stiff and cold, 
For the want of a warm meal. 
CHORE 
They say why don't you go to work, 
Whed they know there's none to be had, 
They slain the door in front; of your face. 
If you ask them for a 
bite of bread. 
Some tramps they beg from door to door; 
And they ask for charity, 
They say they've children ten at home, 
And they can't support their family, 
But place a 
nickle in their hand, 
To some grog shop they will run, 
A 
poor man's money they will take, 
And spend it all for rum 
CHORUS. 
Now that's the kind that want no work, 
For they're weak aud sick is their plea, 
When they get bread they'll throw it away 
From a 
workingman's poor family. 
'Twas at an humble cot I 
called, 
And I 
rapoed at the back door; 
A 
loan asked me what would I 
have, 
I 
told him I 
was hungry and poor. 
Said he come in and take a 
seat, 
And he gave ine bread and tea, 
Be was a 
son of Erin's Isle, 
'1 oiling for his fatuity. 
CHORUS 
I 
shook his hand so hard and tough, 
And the tears rolled fast down my face, 
May Heaven protect his good family, 
For you're welcome always at his plaole.

As we walk thro' the streets how often we meet, • 
Some poor old man who's life is naught but woe; 
With age his form is bent, in his pockets not a 
cent, 
And for shelter he knows not where to go. 
With relations by the score who drive him from the door. 
And meet him on the street they pass him by, 
If you ask him why it's done, he will answer 
you and say, 
I 
am poor and old and only in : he way. 
CHORUS. 
So let us cheer them on, they won't te with us long, 
Don't let us sneer because they're oli and gray; 
And remember while we are young the days to 
es may come, 
When we'll be old and only in the way. 
There was a 
time I 
hear when the young were 
not so queer, 
But since that time there's came an awful change, 
Young men in health and might, their old 
parents they will strike, 
It happens every day, it's nothing strange. 
When he his bread can't earn, his children do 
him spurn, 
For death I 
am sure he oftentimes does pray, 
'Himself and faithful wife after toiling all their life, 
When old they find they're only in the way. 
Cho. 
My 
little song I'm sure is for rich as well as poor, 
For take a 
rich man when he's growing old, 
us friends will shake his hand, his relations 
round him stand, 
Awaiting for him to die they want his gold. 
Then let us from this hour, do all that's in our power. 
To make the road for the old folks light and gay, 
And if they trouble on us cast, why let us be the last. 
To say when old that they are only in the way.

So I 
am here to greet you all, 
And to thank ye for yere welcome to a 
stranger; 
I 
got a 
job of work, 
Since I 
landed in New York, 
But my work is attended with great danger, 
For a 
mason's clerk am I, 
One whose always climbing high, 
And the hod and ladder is my occupation; 
But for politics I'm bound, 
And I'm bound to get around, 
To assist in making laws for this great nation. 
CHORUS. 
Paddy Duffy is my name, 
I

Whether rich or poor, of high or low degree; 
Like Muldoon the solid guy,

Of a 
self-made, high-toned gentleman, you see! 
(Dance.) 
One day while on the ladder, 
Oh 1 
I 
never yet got madder, 
Then I 
did upon that very same occasion; 
Some bricks fell from my hod, 
And lit upon the nob 
Of a 
German peddlar of the Jew persuasion; 
Sheeiaey called hard names to Pat, 
For the bricks had broke his hat; 
I 
was angry, and the truth I 
had to tell, 
Oh 1 
sez I, you dirty Jew, 
But for your ancestors, like you, 
The Lord would be alive to-day, and doing well.

From Lancashire we came, 
Our parents in the cotton mill 
Are working now at home. 
But trade was slack, and pay is bad, 
So they sent us here 
To try and show you all the way 
They dance in Lancashire.

We 
will make the wooden clogs go tap, tap, tap; 
If you'll but give a cheer, 
And 'twill give us great delight,

When at night our work is done, 
We dance out on the green, 
The lads and lassies all are there, 
With smiling faces seen. 
Now we've told you all our history, 
If you think us sincere, 
Bestow your kind applause upon 
These lads from Lancashire.

we're the brother's DobltiN and we doesn't 
care by jove, 
So long as we get three meals each day, 
We're called two blarsted Englishmen, two 
regular crooked coves,

We were born in Lancashire, our accent does

Since Willie's left us it's so lonely, 
No more his cheery voice we hear; 
He was my darling, -yes, mine only, 
For, oh! he loved his mamma dear. 
His rosy cheeks, his eyes of heavenly blue, 
The smile that round his sweet lips played, 
His curling locks of golden hue, 
But, oh! how quickly all did fade. 
CHORUS. 
Alas! they laid him in the cold, cold grave, 
His little spirit is at rest; 
tine token of remembrance I 
have saved, 
'Tis a 
blossom from our Angel Willis's breast. 
While all around my boy were weeping, 
He lay so silent and so cold; 
It seemed that he was only sleeping, 
That soon he'd prattle as of old. 
I 
knew the parting moments were so near, 
His pale cold lips to mine I

Upon his face I 
dropped a

And plucked this blossom from his breast.

Completely perplexed; 
I'm the father of a

LAKE SHORE ON SUNDAY NIGHT. 
WRITTEN AND SUNG DY FRANK MEW. 
I 
am going to sing a 
funny song, 
And the subject is not very long, 
It's all about the funny sights, 
On the lake shore on a 
Sunday night, 
Such droves of people I 
declare. 
From five till ten, are walking there, 
All other streets deserted quite, 
For the Lake Shoreon a 
Sunday night. 
Cnonus. 
Oh if you doubt then what I 
say, 
Go yourself most any day, 
(to yourself and see the sights, 
On the lake shore on Sunday night. 
There are bachelors gay sporting away, 
Laughing and talking with maidens gay, 
And old maids you will often find 
With little poodle dogs behind, 
Oh! don't they one -another squeeze, 
It's when they feel the evening breeze, 
If the stars could speak tell tales they might, 
Of Lake View Park on Sunday night. 
Chorus. 
I'll tell you what me most annoys, 
It is to see so many naughty boys, 
Running around with common cigars, 
When they should be home with their 
pa's and nuts, 
And young girls scarce sixteen years old, 
Running around them so bold, 
And doing things that isn't right, 
On the Lake Shore on Sunday night, 
Chorus. 
Young widows tired of single life, 
Wishing to become again a 
wife, 
Are trying with many a 
wicked leer, 
To catch a 
stylish husband dear. 
And gay young sports a 
strolling along, 
Singing " Maggie Gordon" or some love song, 
With sweethearts under their arm so tight, 
On the Lake Shore on Sunday night.

was invited, 
To attend a

I 
dressed myself up in my best, 
I 
hurried to the hall. 
All sorts were there, I 
do declare, 
And sweet music it was play'd; 
We had a 
jolly racket 
At Kerrigan's Masquerade! 
CHORUS. 
Hands all around, boys! 
Sweet music it was play'd; 
Arrah! forward four, we welt the floor, 
At Kerrigan's Masquerade. 
At ten o'clock, precisely, 
We had to close the door; 
It was crowded to suffocation, 
And it could not hold no more. 
There was ninety-seven couples 
Round the hall did promenade— 
Old Ireland was represented 
At Kerrigan's Masquerade! 
Kerrigan was dressed, I 
do declare, 
Regardless of expense, 
lie waxed his moustache up with soap, 
He fairly looked immense. 
His hair was tarred with axel grease, 
He had a 
five cent shave; 
It would make you die when to waltz he tried, 
The night of the masquerade.

And tell you all about the widow's party,

Ah! the charming Widow Clancy, 
She was any man's fancy, 
She was a 
fluent talker, and a

McGinn sang Pin- a- fore, 
Till his throat was very sore, 
And " Little Dudeen," sang by Smith so sweetly, 
Crosby Banc, a 
little ditty, 
The girls all called him witty, 
And McGuffin done an Irish jig so neatly. 
Flynn sang, " Dancing on the green," 
Also " She's a 
fairy queen." 
Fkod sang " Hold the fort for we're the 
strongest party," 
And Murphy and Tim Lang, 
Done the Lack-a-wan-na Gang, 
Down at the charming Widow Clancy's party. Clio. 
As it was growing late, 
Sure we tho't was time to ate, 
We went in two by two's down to the supper, 
We were hardly seated right, 
When there was a 
fearful fight, 
For McGuinness swore the whiskey was all water, 
All around ' twas hand to hand, 
And they nearly killed the band, 
When in stepped the famous boxer Mike McCarthy, 
He swore by the powers above, 
That he'd just put on the gloves,

There's a

And it's known as fair Erin's green isle ; 
Sure it's there I 
was born on a 
bright summer's morn, 
And with joy my relations did smile. 
My father and mother, my sister and brother, 
Were pleased, to- be-sure, all the while. 
rhey shed tears of joy, for their bright Irish boy, 
That was born on fair Erin's green isle. 
You may talk about France, or England or Spain, 
Of their beautiful maids and greet men ; 
But the whole world does know that fair Erin can show, 
Nobler sons, truer daughters, than them. 
Such names as O'Connell and Moore I 
will mention, 
And brave Duke of Wellington, while 
King Brian Boroghue, and our bold Emmett too, 
Saw the light on fair Erin's Green Isle, 
There's the Killarney lakes on Erin's Green Isle, 
They're so lovely enchanting and fine. 
Sure the valley's and mountain's are secood to no. 
For their beauty is really sublime 
There grows in profusion the dear little shamrock, 
Encouraged by Nature's sweet smile, 
Dear land of-my birth, garden spot of the earth, 
You're my idol fair Erin's Green Isla,

COMPOSED AND RrcrrED BY WAIMBII MACI. 
Copyright 1881 by Mrs. Pauline Lieder. 
It was just behind the woodshed, 
One glorious summer day; 
Far o'er the hills the sinking stua, 
Pursued its western way. 
And in my lone seclusion, 
Safely removed afar 
From all earth's confusion, 
I 
smoked my first cigar. 
.A.12 1 
bright the boyish fancies, 
Wrapped in the wreaths of blue, 
My eyes grew dim my head was light. 
The woodshed round me flew, 
Dark night closed in around me, 
Rayless without a 
star, 
Grim death I 
thought I 
had fotutd, 
When I 
smoked my first cigar. 
I 
heard my fathers smothered laugh. 
It seemed so strange and far;

I'd smoked my first cigar.

TAKE ME IN YOUR ARMS, MAMA. 
BEAUTIFUL SONG AND CHORUS. 
On that dark, foggy night when the ill-fated steamer Narra" 
gansett was sinking with its scores of precious souls, a 
lonely 
mother, traveling with her little child, was among those whose 
safety lay througa unknown perils. 
While she was preparing 
to leap from the burning wreck, her little child; with heartfelt 
pathos, cried, " OH, TAKE ME IN YOUR ARMS, MAMA 
V' 
She tried to brave the angry billows with her darling one; but, 
alas, her efforts were in vain. The arms that held the 
cheri
shed 
one relaxed their loving embrace, _,,and when again Ow mother 
beheld the little pieader the once night eyes were closed for-
ever. She had exchanged mother's love for that of the angels.

Take me in your arms dear mama, 
As the waves around us roll, 
I 
am lonely in the darkness, 
While the bells unceasing toll. 
Will there be a 
fairer morning, 
With the sunbeams clear and bright, 
When we both go home to papa, 
Take me in your arms to- night. 
CHORUS. 
Darker grew the hours of waiting, 
With no ray of hope in sight, 
While the mother clasped her darling, 
In her arms of love that night. 
In the waves so tired and feeble, 
Struggling for her darling's sake, 
Was that mother weak and hop less, 
Praying for the dawn to break. 
But the arms that held her pleader, 
Soon relaxed fr strength had gone, 
And the mother broken-hearted, 
In her grief was all alone.

When the morning dawned in beauty, 
With the sun- beanie clear and bright, 
She went, home alone to papa,

Take me in your arms, dear mamma,

.N3 OPENING, 
COMPOSED AND RECITED BY WALTER MACE. 
COPYRIGHT 1881, BY MRS. PAUISNE LIBDER. 
I 
heard of a 
preacher who once made a 
remark, 
Saying actors never could, 
Get in at the gate of heaven, 
Or do anything that was good. 
Now I 
think he was wrong in saying these words, 
For I 
know two or three of the boys, . 
Who done good things in their life-time, 
And never made any noise. 
Now there was a 
man called Big Billy Devere, 
He sat up day and night, 
To nurse poor Stevy Rogers when sick, 
While olhers turned tail in affright. 
And Whittaker, lately hurt in New York, 
Had many to come to his aid; 
And a 
number of others, I 
could name if I 
choose, 
Who are now in the church-yard laid. 
One day lately, I 
went across town, 
To an actor that I 
know; 
lie lived in a 
tenement house up town, 
A 
place called Poverty Row. 
Times had been hard with him lately, 
Harder than ever before; 
So I 
thought I 
would go and give him a 
lift 
From ray own rather humble store. 
I 
knocked at his door, no answer came. 
I 
listened all was still; 
And over my whole being 
There crept a 
death-like chill; 
I 
called for help, the neighbors came, 
We busted in the door, 
And found the object of our search 
Lying dead upon the' floor. 
NO OPENING, 
CONTINUED. 
He had died of a 
broken weary heart, 
0! God, can such things really be, 
In this great heaving, throbbing world, 
And no one near to see. 
Yes, there is One, my friends, 
Who notes the sparrows fall, 
Whose loving eyes are ever on 
The Sinner, Saint, and all. 
A 
postal card beside him lay, 
I 
stooped and picked it up; 
it told the sad, sad story, 
How grief had over-run his cup, 
For on one side I 
plainly read 
The actors home and name, 
While on the other, were the words. 
No Opening, write again. 
Be had went away and left us, 
Gone to a 
happier home; 
Gone to Him who bade us all, 
Suffer little ones to come, 
Gone to that bright and happy land, 
Where there's no sorrow care or pains 
To a 
manager who never said, 
No Opening, write again,

In eighteen hundred and sixty one, 
The war it first broke out; 
The poor unfortunate Irishmen 
Were scattered all about. 
The rich man would not go and. fight, 
But for the poor ones they did hunt; 
Then hand in hand to Dixie's land, 
Went the Irishmen to the front. 
• 
CHORUS. 
Then give a 
cheer for we Yankee boys, 
For the enemy we must hunt, 
So hand in hand to Dixie's Land, 
Went the Irishmen to the front. 
When we got on board the train, 
We had not been long gone; 
Until we found our enemy; 
Were about ten thousand strong. 
We sent back telegraph despatches, 
And such time was never made, 
When Gen McClellan our little Mac, 
Led on the Irish Brigade. 
So now me Yankee comrades, 
Don't harm an Irishman, 
For,Paddies door is open for you, 
With a 
warm and welcome hand. 
I 
hope the day is not very far off, 
When old Ireland shall have her rights, 
And that little green banner float in victory, 
Along with the Stars and Stripes.

Joys of my childhood are now gone forever, 
Bright hours of the past I 
shall never more see, 
Flowers of the wild wood and home by the river, 
Yes gone are the joys that were once dear to me. 
Rocks that I 
loved in the days of my childhood, 
And brooklets by whose peaceful waters I'd play, 
While watching the sunbeams which brightened the wildwood, 
Live only in memories chambers to- day.

Joys of my childhood are now gone forever, 
Bright hours of the past I 
shall never more see; 
Flowers in the wild wood and borne by the rivcr, 
Yes, gone are the joys that were once dear to meh. 
Hours of my childhood come back in my dreaming, 
Once more in my fancy I 
see vale and hill, 
That flowing streamlet whose waters were gleaming, 
While leaping o'er cascades to run the old will. 
Forest o( oaks where the sweet birds were singing. 
And roses abloom ' neath the fair summer sky, 
In dreams of the past sweet remembrance is bringing, 
,. 
Of days I 
once cherished forever gone by. Chorus 
Days of my childhood I 
love to remember, 
Bright hours of the past with'their merry good cheer; 
Bloom of the valley from May to December, 
lhe snow flakes which heightened the rest of the year. 
Then in the fall, picking apples so golden, 
Or making the sugar when springtime had come, 
We love to recount jrys of childhood so olden, 
When sunbeams shine brightly on dear ones at home. OW 
I 
Gone are the days that my heart fondly cherished, 
And past are the charms I 
would love to recall ; 
Dear is th e 
th ought th at 
when childhood's joys perished, 
The bliss of remembrance was loft to us all 
Now as down life's winding pathway I 
wander, 
My memory cling- to its past treasures yet, 
The sunshine which brightened my childhood's home von 
And friends ever patient I 
cannot forget. ors

Sweetly in the twilight dancing, 
Fairy-like with form entrancing, 
Cunning elf with mischief glancing, 
Little roguish eyes ; 
O'er the dew with lightness creeping, 
While the glow-worm soft is sleeping, 
And the bright stars forth are peeping, 
Peeping with surprise. 
As she wanders through the dell, 
hushed is every birdie's song, 
For each songster knows full well, 
She rules the warbling throng. 
Brighter seems the day declining, 
As with sunlight still combining, 
Where her gleam o'er all is shining, 
Little roguish eyes. 
(Dams.) 
tllithely in the eariy morning, 
Summer d
ila is gently dawning, 
Lifting night s 
be- darkened awning, 
Little roguish eyes; 
As she wades the brooklet flowing, 
Moves amid the violets growing, 
Not a 
thought on one bestowing, 
Which around her lies. 
May her future life be pure, 
lay her sweetness never fade, 
lay grim sorrow ne'er secure, 
My own dear mountain maid. 
Joy o'er all my darling flinging, 
Hear the lark her praises singing, 
For to all sweet mirth she's bringing, 
Little roguish eyiis. (Hattoalf

MAN YOU DON'T MEET 
EVERY DAY, 
rye a 
nice little cabin that's built with mud, 
In the beautiful County Kildare, 
I've got acres of land, and men at command, 
And I 
have always a 
shilling to spare. 
Och! I 
didn't come here, boys, in search of a 
job, 
But just a 
short visit to pay, 
And as I 
walk through the streets, people say 
that I 
meet, 
There's the man you don't meet every day. 
CnoRts. 
Then call for your glasses, just have what you want, 
And whatever the damage I'll pay; 
Bhoys be airy and free when you're drinking wid me, 
For I'm the man you den't meet every day. 
When I 
landed in Glasgow, what a 
sight met 
my eyes, 
As,I first put my foot on the shore; 
There was Felix O'Donough, blind Barney MeGurk, 
And a 
round two or three dozen more. 
Och! rnurther! you ought to have seen them 
all stare, 
And then they did all run away; 
Says I, •‘ my spalpeens, do you think I'm a 
ghost, 
Because I'm a 
man you don't meet every day. 
Chorus. 
I'm in love with a 
nice little girl in town, 
And we're going to be married to-day, 
And if 
come over a 
twelvemonth from now, 
A 
right welcome to all I 
will pay. 
And I 
think I 
can show you a 
little spalpeen, 
Who then will be able to say--
To my friends round about, while yointing me out, 
There's the man you don't meet every day.

You may think that I 
am mad, 
But I 
only feel so sad, 
The reason I 
will tell you every one ; 
I 
courted a 
nice young girl, 
Whose name was Peggy Doyle, 
And I 
brought her to Coney Isle to have some fin,. 
She is from the County Down, 
And she weighed two hundred pound, 
And I 
thought that she'd be true to um all the whik. 
biz! if ' ' to do it again, 
She 
go to swim 
Along 
we I 
o"., 
Isle: 
She had salt water sure, galore, 
And she swallowed a 
quart or more, 
And the gang upon the beach began toomile, 
1. hey all did wave their hats, 
And shouted " float her pat," 
The day I 
brought my Peg to Coney Isle. 
Now its when we reached the pier, 
We went and had some beer, 
And after that we went and had a 
bathe, 
You may talk about your fat woman 
That traveled with liarnum's show, 
But you ought to see my Peg upon the wave,. 
The gang e
,, minenced to guy us, 
bly bosom was on fire. 
When the gang gave to me a 
grand hurray, 
When a 
lad with a 
crooked mouth, 
•‘Beheave us." shouted out, ( Chorna. 
There's one of the sea lions that escaped the other day 
Of course I 
did feel mail, after listening to that lad, 
Of course he I 
thought that lie was awful smart, 
But if I 
had him in New York 
Up near the Central Park, 
You can bet your life that I 
would break his heart, 
I 
don't say Pm a 
lighter, a 
cutter or a 
biter 
But I 
can tak.; my own part all the while. 
Arrah-inusha bad luck to Peg, she will stand 
upon her head, 
Bistore I 
bring her again to Coney Isle.
