She Didn't Love Me at all. 
By C. H. Hughes, 
For E. C. Edwards. 
I 
was madly in love with a 
nice young girl. 
She didn't love me at all; 
Whe7iever I'd see h r 
my head would whirl, 
She didn' love me at all. 
I 
spent lots of money and cut quite a 
dash, 
I 
bought her ice cream and all sorts of trash, 
But when I 
proposed she was off l_ke a 
flash, 
She didn't love me at all. 
CHORUS. 
She d 
dn't love me at all, 
She said I 
had too much gall, 
I 
never look back but I 
weep and sigh, 
When I 
think how she sacked me, 
And blackened my eye, 
But I 
hope we will meet in the sweet by and by, 
She didn't love me at all. 
I 
called her my popsy and all sorts of dears, 
She didn't love me at all. 
She would cut me so short I 
of en shed tears, 
She didn't love me at all. 
And often around bier I'd silently creep, 
Go down on my knees and worship her feet, 
But eeling teject:d I'd go home and weep, 
She didn't love me at all, 
Chorus. 
I 
tried many plans but I 
couldn't succeed, 
She didn't 1 
we me at all; 
Although I 
impl red her she never would heed, 
She didn't love Inc at all. 
She got all my wealth 
heart it did pant, 
And t 
be last time I 
asked he site said I 
can't, 
And left toe you see a 
heart broken tramp, 
:Ale didn't love me at

Charactar So g 
written and sung by C. H, Hughes. 
Behold a 
fib le minded chap, 
I've been jilted twice or more, 
I 
don't see why I 
ne'er can wed, 
The girl that I 
adore. 
I 
always was quite nobby, 
At least that's what I 
the ght, 
They all seen to dili he ny shape, 
And they know it's not my fault, 
They know, they kno , they know 
And they know it's not my fault. 
When fi st I 
loved you've no ideN: . 
How my heart went pit a 
pat, 
I 
fed my girl on caramels,. - 
Gum drops and things like that; 
She filled me full of flattery, 
And called me darling dear, 
But when I 
popped the question she said, 
Go slide off on your ear go slide, 
Go slide, go slide, go slide, 
Go slide ofi on your ear. 
My friends said don't discouraged ba, 
.But try your 1 [ lel< I 
gain, 
I 
think it was a 
p.it up job, 
For the next was just the same. 
She drained me of may fortune, 
At least of all I

ad. 
And when I 
asked her for her hand, 
She said go ask my dad, 
She, said, she said, she caid, 
She said go ask my dad,

Recite I 
by E. C. Edwards. 
Oh ! Willie, most yon leave me 
To siLl the ocem blue ? 
If so I ! nust cou-ole myself, 
And, alas ! bid y 
on 
But, Willie, when you're sailing, 
And the ocean's g,etting;green, 
Will yon think of me in Chino, 
Eating strawberries and cream. 
Now, Willie, whe you're climbing, 
Up the mizzen- mast so high, 
13e sure on have your fooling, 
For if you fall you'll die. 
And if the wind is bl wing hot, 
And the sun is shining fair, 
Wear a 
black chip turban bonnet, 
To keep the freckles from your hair. 
And, Willie, when it's pay-day, 
Do not throw your cash away, 
Buy a 
quarL of roisted peanuts 
To put by for a 
rainy clay. 
And if they build a 
railroad, 
Across the I,riny deep. 
You can use the rails for plasters 
To keep bunions from your feet.

Sung by E. C Edwards. 
My name it is Reilly, I'm not long on the fol.

And when I 
go walking I 
hear the boys say. 
Cnouns.

Is that Sorgent Reilly the tenth ward sw ,I1, 
If that's Sargent Reilly they speak of so high7y, 
Pon my sowl Reilly, you're_koin quite well.

Where the boys and the girls were so friskey, 
You know the ladies were charming, 
The band it

I 
could hear them all say.

In the summer time when all is fine, 
And the trees and grass are green, 
When the boys arc drinking lager beer, 
And everything's serene. 
On Tom McDonnell's old tin roof, 
The boys do dance at night, 
With Kitty Malone and Mary Shea,

Who sing with all their might, 
They have a 
big accordeon, the music it is grand. 
You'll hear them shout for miles away, 
Faith they never will go home, 
While they can have a 
tune 
And " Tracy 
on his instruments will play.

It's polkas, waltzes, gnadrilles all night, ' tis finer 
than the op'ra bonffe; 
If you don't believe 
right, call around there any night, 
And you'll find us on McDonnell's old tin roof! 
They call themselves the midnight owls, 
They dance by light of moon, 
To start for home at two o'clock, 
They said it was too soon. 
They keep the folks awake at night, 
They never have their rest, 
To sing their songs ant play their tunes, 
They do their level best. 
The music it is charming, it really is divine, 
'Tis finer than the opera, when they do the Boston dip, 
Faith the house rocks like a 
ship; 
Oh ! there.s 
no place like McDonnell's old tin roof, 
Across the street from where I 
live, a 
German keeps a 
store, 
He's a 
bakei man by trale, he's Nvorth a 
thousand or more. 
He keeps about tire iiini at work of course they're up all night 
But when they hear the music play they shout with deligut, 
About the time tne hrea I

They don't stop till they've r,- ached the door then they'll

And the bread they'll nip so neat,

Don't Forget the Old Folks at Home. 
Words and Music by J. F. 
SLIF-RIDAN. 
For the young folks our song is intended, 
Them their duty we wish to remind ; 
We hope they will not be offunded— 
'Tis said, with intentions most kind ; 
We know as they spring up from childhood. 
To strange, distant countries they roam, 
And seldom, if ever, a 
thought give 
To the old folks so lonely at home. 
CHOnus. 
Don't forget the p- or old folks at home; 
Remember the old folks at home ; 
They nursed you with care— 
Your hardships did bear ; 
Don't forge+, the poor old folks at home. 
They protected and nursed, aye, and cared fol 
You, when so fragile and weak ; 
They watched with affection your firs4smile, 
And taught you to lisp and to speak; 
And now they in turn have grown helpless, 
Old age cruel traces have shown ; 
Is it right to refuse them assistance, 
Ind leave them forgotten, alone! 
Don't forget, .k.e.

The reason why we're (lancing here, 
We will explain to you; 
We love two charming, pretty girls, 
To whom we will be true; 
The beauty that they both possess, 
Vie with the rose and pink; 
To-night we meet by the babbling brook, 
Where the wild birds dip and. drink. 
CHOWLS: 
Oh, my, when we hear sweet music play, 
We love to (lance and sing; [ 13real,.. 
It tills our hearts with great delight, 
To hear the heel taps rin27; [ Break 
Their beautv is surpassed by none, 
We know you'd think the same; 
They dwell ' mid flowers ; ich and rare, 
Down yonder shady lane. 
We met one evening in :fitly, 
In love's sweet peaceful bower; 
'Twas there and then we called them both, 
Primrose and Prairie Flower; 
And since that tune we've often met, 
'Twieli blossoms white and pink; 
And told our love neath the stars above, 
Where the wild birds dip and drink. 
ICiss Me Good Bye, Darling. 
!kb song by JOHN C. Laacm, in Sim Francisco. allit 
Gently the moon mounts the sky, 
Stars their uightwak:h do keep. 
A.nd why let those tears dim thine eye? 
Thine were not made, love, to weep. 
Look up and tell me you love me, 
Grief nearly breaks my poor heart, 
Smile once again in mine eye, 
Then kiss me, kis me, ere we part. 
Unonue. 
Good bye, darling, goodbye, 
Do not grieve or MiEB me, 
I 
must go; I 
leave you wee**, 
So good by darling, kin me. 
Farewell my loved one, my own, 
Oh, but be true unto me, 
Soon will my life bark be thrown 
Out on the tempest at sea.

Smile once again ere I

Then kiss me, kiss me, ere we part,

Come, gay dearg 
Shelling Green Peas. 
First sung in America by HARRY RICHMOND, with tremendous applause. 
I 
sing you a 
ditty, of damsel so pretty, 
Who lived from the city some seventeen miles ; 
Her name is Maria, her worthy old sire 
Was clerk and town crier—his name was John Styles. 
With lips like the cherry, a 
smile, too, so merry, 
I 
thought her the very one suited to please, 
And when I 
first met her, and tried hard to get her, 
For worse or for better, she was shelling green peas. 
CHORUS. 
Under the trees, a 
bowl on her knees, 
Maria sat silently shelling green peas. 
I'd long lov'd her dearly, truly, sincerely, 
At length I 
thought, really, I'd settle in life ; 
Although aged fifty, I'd been very thrifty, 
And thought ' twas high time to be taking a 
wife. 
With bosom on fire, in search of Maria, 
Thro' lanes of wild-bricr, o'er-shadow'd by trees ; 
I 
stroll'd to the spot where, outside her cot there, 
She was sitting so patiently shelling green peas. 
Under the trees, & c. 
I 
step up unto her, commencing to woo her, 
I 
said 
That no truer fond heart could Le found 
Than mine ; if she'd take me some morning, and make me 
The happiest mortal for twenty miles round." 
22 
SHELLING GREEN PEAS. 
Continzred. 
I 
said, " Our life might be one round of delight, 
Like the little birds singing upon the green trees." 
To a 
whisper then dropping my voice without stopping, 
The question was popping, as she popped the peas. 
Under the trees, &c. 
No answer she made, and I 
was much afraid 
That this beautiful maid had not heard all I 
said. 
At her feet kneeling, I 
tried to be stealing 
A 
kiss—when came reeling her hand on my head ; 
" 
Do you think I'd engage," she cried out in a 
rage, 
"With a 
man twice my age, so clear out if you please." 
In a 
terrible passion, at me she sent crashing, 
On my head smashing the bowl of green peas." 
Under the trees, &c. 
By way of addenda, she said, " Sir, remember 
That May and December can never unite, 
Your leave, sir, be taking," my neck nearly breaking, 
I 
made my escape in a 
terrible fright. 
I 
never will marry, but single will tarry 
Tho' friends and acquaintances do nothing but tease, 
Whenever they meet me, in this style they greet me, 
" 
Old boy, what's the price now of lamb and green 
peas?" 
CHORUS. 
Yes, how they tease, whenever they please, 
By shouting out after me, " Lamb and green peas." 
There's a 
Sweet Face at the Window. 
BY HARRY BURNS. 
There's a 
sweet face at the window, 
And it's looking o'er at me, 
Till its glances soft and loving 
Fills my soul with ecstacy, 
And its pretty eyes are blending 
Like the moon-lit sky when blue 
With its radiance transcending 
Like the rainbow's lovely hue. 
CHORUS. 
There's a 
sweet face at the window, 
See it glancing through the pane. 
And my heart is sadly waiting 
Till I 
see it once again. 
Mere is music softly flowing 
From those sweet lips thro' the air 
And ray heart with love is glowing 
For that sweet face over there, 
And its melody is sounding, 
Till I 
feel its joyous thrill, 
And my spirit quickly bounding 
To its music sweet and still. 
There's a 
sweet face, etc. 
Yes, your eyes of dark blue flashing, 
Sends me feeling so divine, 
You who are so handsome, dashing, 
That I 
love to call you mine; 
And your sweet face at the window, 
How it haunts me in my dreams! 
Then how sad when I 
awaken 
Finding life not what it seems. 
There's a 
sweet face, etc. 
Ms 
your sweet face at the window 
That is ever in my view, 
And it fills me o'er with gladness, 
For my thoughts are all for you; 
Yes, my thoughts are always flying 
To the one I 
love so dear, 
And my heart is sadly sighing 
For that sweet face over there. 
There's a 
sweet face, etc.

BOSTON HARRY." 
Written, composed and sung by J. H. CONROY, of O'NEIL & Cernoy• 
Irish Comedians, Vocalists and Sketch Artists. 
I'm a 
fellow who's fond of pleasure, 
No matter where I 
roam; 
At my hours of pleasure, 
I 
make iny.elf at home; 
Oh, give to me the outside sport, 
On the fields I 
love to tarry; 
The boys around the parks, call me 
Pretty Boston Harry. 
ClioRtS: 
Oh ta-ta ta, oh, ta-ta ta, 
Wherever I 
may go; 
I'm one that's fond of pleasure, 
Boston Harry, oh; 
Oh ta-ta, hi, oh ta-ta, ta, 
Wherever I 
may look; 
I 
aiwav-. wear the lest costume, 
Of any of the boys of the park. 
I 
have a 
charming sweetheart, 
And Josey that 
her name; 
In the summer- time, 
On the lawn we play the croquet game; 
Oh. do I 
not adtnire it; 
My chance I 
would not miss, 
Before my darling parts with me; 
On her lips I 
imprint a 
kiss. 
Oh ta-ta, ta, Sze., &e. 
One evening while out strolling, 
Just for a 
short lark; 
3Iy pet and I 
went wandering, 
Around in Central l'aik; 
While gazing at the fountain, 
We met a 
crazy loon, 
Who asked us to take a 
walk with him, 
To visit a 
Lab boon. 
Oh ta-ta, ta, &e.,

Really My Uncle Now, " Make No 
Mistake." 
Dedicated to ALF. McDowell, by AL. W . 
FILSON. 
I 
am an unfortunate man, and my troubles l'11 tell you 
About the girl I 
married, whom I 
thought was so true ; 
But the way she deceived inc was dreadfully awful, 
And the scheme that she practiced I'll now show to you • 
Last Wednesday night, when I 
went to my dwelling— 
I 
had been to the club, and got home rather late— 
As I 
entered the door a 
young man stood before me; 
My wife, to explain, says, " Allow me to state:" 
CHORUS, 
"Now my dear, don't get huffy ; it's only my uncle; 
Don't let this small matter keep you awake ; 
Don't work yourself up to a 
pitch of excitement, 
For it's really my uncle; now, make no mistake." 
She says that her uncle has a 
very large fortune, 
And that when he dies she'll inherit her share ; 
But his being at my tione that time in the morning 
Don't look right to me—now, it don't, I 
declare. 
Now, when her dear uncle said : " I 
ant- t 
be going," 
He kissed her three times ere he went on his way ; 
I 
jumped to the door, determined to kill him. 
But my wife soothed my passion, as to me she did say: 
" 
Now my dear, don't get huffy," &-c. 
All the next day I 
felt very uneasy ; 
I 
did nothing at all but sit down and I 
moped ; 
But when I 
got home I 
had good cause for action, 
For my wife and her uncle they both had eloped, 
I 
rushed to my room, I 
WiS perfectly frantic, 
To see if some trace of Ier I 
couldn't find ; 
But instead of that I 
there found a 
letter, 
And in it were written the following lines: 
" 
Now my dear, don't get huffy," Sze.

There lives the girl I

CHORUS. 
Pretty little Nancy will you love me? 
For you know I

I 
will love you in the mOrning and the evening, 
If you will only wed me, Nancy Green.

Where first I 
met Miss Nance, 
The little birds sang sweetly, 
My 11=-1 was in a

She did not answer no, 
And on next Sunday afternoon 
We both to the church will go.

Through dark raging seas may divide; 
We sigh, when we hear your dear name. 
To welcome you back to our side. 
Well write you a

We dream of you, darling, each night. 
We love you wherever you roam, 
We'll kiss every word that we write. 
We'll write you a 
letter from home, 
To bear you our love o'er the sea, 
To gladden your heart as you roan; 
And cheer you wherever you be.

&s sung with immense success by Miss Lottie Winnett, and 
Miss Pauline Batcheler, the world known vocal queens 
To help one along I 
do all I 
can, 
And all should assist with their mights, 
To say a 
kind word or do a 
good deed 
Is one of my greatest delights. 
If a 
man who is poor approaches my door, 
I 
don't turn on him with U. frown, 
But 1 
give him my might, for surely ' tis right, 
If we're up to assist those who're down. 
(norms— 
And thus I 
go on, 
With the world's busy throng. 
I 
avoid all contention and strife, 
But I 
do all I 
can 
To aid each poor man, 
Mounting upward the ladder of life, 
Every day in this town of xvealth and re- flown, 
We can see hundreds hungry for bread, 
And perhaPs if '
twere known there are others at 
h 
cee , 
Deffeiiding on them to be fed. 
Oh kbzit Mammon would turn from his pleasure 
to learn, 
Of 'their suffering and aid their distress, 
How many would pray for his we,11 night and day, 
And the giver would always be blessed.

The Mon That We Ought to Avoid. 
A man is oft known by the friends that he keeps, 
or bird; of a 
fcatii ,r 
via fina, 
Will oft :lock to ,' ter— and co to the fact, 
It is right we should never be blind 
How malls' a 
hope of advancement in life, 
Hai', been by false friendship destroyed ; 
So it cannot be wrong to name in my song, 
Some men you ought to avoid, 
CHORT2.3. 
Some sham to be gold, but with plenty of brass, 
You'll very soon find them alloyed, 
A man who seems this, and proves to be that, 
Is a 
man you ought to avoid. 
There are men who will borrow at every chance, 
Whom ' twere better at once to offend, 
But the danger is worse in knowing a 
man, 
'Whose business is ever to lei. I, 
He has interest in von and from you as well, 
And e'en if of cash you're _ ovoid, 
Your uncle who hangs ow, the three golden balls, 
Is a 
man that you ought to avoid. 
A lawyer who runs up his six-and-eight fees, 
A drunkard with unsteady gait, 
A braggart whose talk is all full of bombast, 
As of wisdom is empty his pate; 
A 
liar whose word is a 
pitfall and snare, 
A parson wh)st time is ell,p1,yed 
Informing on erhnes for the sake of the fines, 
These are men that we ought to avoid. 
The egotist praising his own paltry deeds, 
Who'll of nothing but self ever speak, 
The smooth, fawning, oil talking, eat sort of man 
The tale- bearing, tit- tattle sneak ; 
These all are the pests of our snug little isle, 
By which we are oftimes i.nnoved, 
Like sharks in the sea or flips in your tea, 
They are things that you ought to avoid. 
AIN'T HE A. BABY. 
Words and music by TM ROGERS, as sung by him with great 
BlICCOSS at HARRIGAN S; 
HART'S Theater Cott:ague. 
I AM a 
swell. 
I 
lead the style: 
I'm not Champagne Charlie nor Tommy Coaloil. 
But you can see plain by my winning ways 
That I 
am a 
man that has seer: better days. 
But for all tha'; I 
don't care a 
straw, 
For I'm just as lively as ever, ha, ha 
The pet of the girls I 
meet every day, 
And as they pass by me ti.t.1 is what they says 
Csonus. 
Oh, my, ain't he a

Look at his Lica curly 11F2r.

Do I

I 
have an eye that can capture a 
queen. 
With my graceful walk I 
make their heads whirl; 
My great Colorados the barbers do curL 
I 
am a 
gambler at high jack and 'ow; 
I 
can play seven otzt and the great casino. 
There'n no use in talking, now don't I

ALWAYS HELP THE POOR. 
Writsz by CRARLEs BuRri-E, for FRANK LEWIS, and sang 
him with marked success. 
Oh, what a 
pleasure 'tis to have a 
man extend the hand 
Of friendship to you, when perhaps a 
stranger in his land; 
But greater still to know and feel on him you can depend, 
Who proves by acts, and not mere words, the value of a 
friend. 
Then never turn your back upon a 
man because he's down, 
But always lend a 
helping hand with smiles and not with 
frowns; 
Let him but think that happiness is yet for him in store, 
And he will bless the giver, boys, who always helps the poor. 
There's the poor boys, one and all, they've many noble traits, 
The millionaire might well be proud to have within his gates; 
The poorest bootblack on our streets may yet gain wealth and 
fame, 
And smile to hear them say, he once was poor, but that's ne 
shame. 
Upon the crossing of the stre'ets 
find them every day, 
Some with barely clothes enough to keep the cold away; 
Yet happiness is beaming upon each face secure, 
For well they know they're numbered to be helped among the 
poor. 
There's the working-girls, God save them from poverty and 
shame, 
A 
cruel word in idle jest might blacken their fair name; 
Then do them all the good you can, and nc'er lot it be said— 
You gave them cause to wish themselves as numbered with tha 
dead. 
From midnight until early dawn you'll find some hard at work, 
While others in the stores, by day, they gain their bread a* 
clerks; 
They do the best they can to keep the wolf from out their door, 
Some future day God will repay the man who helps the poor. 
STRAWBERRIES AND CREAM. 
Composed and written by W. H. DELEHANTY. 
Milk and honey, Oh! its funny— 
I 
cannot keep from dancing; 
For I 
love a 
girl—she's a 
pretty pearl— 
A 
lovely belle supreme— 
She's a 
lolly-pop—sweet forget-me-not,— 
And her voice is so entrancing, 
She's my honeycomb, she's my sugar- plum, 
She's strawberries and cream. 
Yes, she's a 
basket full of fruit, 
She's my pretty love, she's my turtle dove. 
Her voice is like the music of a 
flute, 
And she's just sweet sixteen. 
CHORUS. 
Milk, honey, strawberries and cream 
Like the music of a 
happy dream (
synt.). 
She's a 
darling! she's a 
daisy, 
She's a 
lovely plate of peaches, 
She's a 
dandy—lasses candy— 
kilae's strawberries and cream. 
Repeat chorus. 
I'm enraptured, I 
am captured, 
By a 
lovely lump of sweetness. 
She's an oyster pie, she's a 
chicken pie, 
Aud she haunts my every dream. 
She's a 
little maid, she's a 
lemonade, 
And the pink of perfect neatness. 
She's a 
box of dates, she's a 
bunch of grape; 
She's strawberries and cream. 
Oh! yes, she's far too sweet to live, 
Is this lolly pop, is this candy shop, 
And her loss I 
know that I 
would grieve— 
Sweet vision of my dream. 
Milk, honey, eta.

From dear old Albion's shore, 
Its lately I've come o'er, 
To try to gain my fortune and a 
name; 
From old Manchester town, 
Where I've rattled up and down, 
And put the other factory boys to shame. 
With a 
pair of wooden shoes, 
Which hard knocks never bruise, 
After working bard all day I've danced away with joyi 
And the neighbors out to ride, 
Would stop at the old roadside, 
Admiring the nimble touches of this jolly factory boy. 
Whcm I 
get through my meal, 
I'd use my toe and heel, 
thst only to settle my dinner down, 
Then away to work I'd wing 
When I'd hear the mill bell ring, 
No livelier lad for many miles around.

"POOR OLD UNOLE TOM." 
Written and composed i0y W. J. GROGAN, and sung by him 
with great success in his sketch, " Uncle Tom's Return." 
MY 
joyous days have passed away, 
For me there's no more rest; 
In Heaven's home soon I 
will be 
Amongst the innocent and blest, 
With angels bright in robes so white 
To protect and guide me on. 
There's a 
laurel now awaits the brow 
Of poor old, feeble Uncle Tom. 
CIIORUS. 
No friend, no home, I'm left alone; 
To my grave I'm journeying on. 
Who will care, or shed a 
tear 
For poor old, feeble Uncle Tom? 
My wife and children, far apart, 
In some distant spot this world they roam, 
Or the good lamb granted their desire 
And their spirits away to heaven have flown. 
When my bones lay beneath the clay, 
And this sheep to his shepherd has gone; 
When you kneel to pray, a 
prayer then say 
For poor old, feeble Uncle Tom. 
CHORrs. 
When my bones lay beneath the clay, 
And this sheep to his shepherd has gone; 
When at prayer you kneel, a 
prayer then yield 
For poor old, feeble Uncle Tom.

THE SLIGO MUSKETEERS. 
Written by HARRY BENNETT, and sung by O'NEIL 8.: cos-Roy, 
Irish Comedians, Vocalists and Sketch Artists. 
Oh, let you stand from under now, and open wide your ears, 
While I 
relate the story of the Sligo Musketeers; 
For when we landed on this soil, out West they made us go, 
For to work at canaling, in the State of Oh—ho—ho. 
But when the war it did break out, the; took our jobs away, 
So we organized a 
company, and started for the fray. 
We 
fought the wild red indian, boys, for many a 
weary day, 
But they couldn't beat the Sligo Musketeers. 
CHORUS: 
With a 
my ha-ha, hay foot straw, 
We marched across the plain for many a 
weary day, 
We thought we ne'erd see home again; 
The indians fought like blazes, 
But their fighting was in vain, 
For they couldn't beat the Sligo Musketeers. 
We fought for Banks and Burnside, with Grant we took a 
[hack, 
But best of all, though he was small, was gallant lit:le Mac; 
If they'd let him have his way, the enemy he'd drive back, 
With the assistance of the Sligo Musketeers. 
For he knew how to engineer, and likewise to command, 
No matter what your station was he'd take you by the hand. 
He looked so noble on his horse, when he was in command 
Of us Irish boys, the Sligo Musketeers.

BEHIND THE SCENES, 
As sung by WILL. Aloe:Ton. 
When but a 
little boy, oh, it really wm my joy 
To visit the theatre, I'll admit, 
And how happy I 
would be, the performances to aft 
While seated in the gallery or pit. 
ld all was real, that the curtain did reveal, 
ince that I 
have passed beyond my teens; 
I 
begin to understand, though in front it may look grassa 
It's very different just behind the scenes. 
So if if you will attend for a , 
now my friends, 
I'll do the hest within my humble means, 
To show to you to- night, though in front it may look brighit 
It's very different just behind the scenes. 
The comedian is one, who, while causing lots of fun, 
His heart may yet hang heavy in his breast; 
And he who plays the king, though it seems a 
curious thing, 
In private may be very poorly dressed. 
Then the ballet girl so fair, who goes floating through the at; 
And looks like little angels there instead , 
Sometimes they have to roam, into a 
wretched home, 
And oftentimes go supperless to bed. 
And those who play the parts, of the men with stony hearts, 
And look as if their tempers were like fiends; 
Could you see them while away, you certainly would say 
They're the mildest looking men behind the scenes. 
Now there's many a 
married pair, I've no doubt you are wan, 
Who in public are so tender and so kind; 
But could you only see them at home in privacy, 
A 
very different state of things you d 
find. 
Sometimes it is the wife who causes all the strife, 
Sometimes it is the hushap.(LI-lio's to blvne; 
But be that as it may, who causes all the fray. 
Their quarreling continues juk, the E 
And oft they try to hide from all the woriL out Ado, 
The snarls and jars with which their housel..+ld teem( 
And often when you hear them call each other dear, 
They hate each other just behind the scenes. 
Now its just the san:Q in life, though what iota of care and 
strife. 
And suffering some folio will undergo 
Just to cut a 
shine, and to make themselves look tine, 
They think of nothing else but outside show. 
Some fancy and suppose, that those who wear good clothes, 
Always are they richest and the best; 
But an honest heart and mind, is respected most you'll find, 
No matter whether rich or poorly dressed. 
Then no matter where we go, from the highest to the low, 
From peasantry ' way up to kings or queens, 
Whatewir we enjoy, then's something to annoy, 
If we mould only peep behind the scones.

I 
keep an actors' boarding house 
Here in the city, 
All the gang about the town say I'm the boss, 
From the leading lady down 
To the back line of the ballet, 
On all the gang I 
have money lost. 
I've got.a little daughter 
That's struck upon the stage, 
And I 
fear that's been ordained by fate. 
She went out the other night 
With a 
couple of the gang, 
When she came home she said " I've got a 
date, 
Cnonns. 
She's going on the stage, ain't it funny, (bus.) 
They're going to use her for a 
dummy, (bus.) 
She must paint, powder and galvanize her face, 
Or she'll never make a 
hit in the world. 
She gets a 
letter every day from little Johnny Shay, 
And wants to double up with Amelia Dean, 
She does a 
walk round to her little song and dance, 
And they say it is the dizziest ever seen, 
She's got a 
lithograph of the terrible danger, Norton, 
Her eyes on Watson & Ellis she wants to feast, 
She's sitting on the end at harry Hill's 
Waiting for Dr. Landis to come East, 
.Cnonrs. 
Six .dollars a 
week is her salary, (bus.) 
Three she gives up to the gallery, ( bus.) 
She kicked, got fired clean out of the place, 
Now she's biscuit shooting in our boarding house;

TIM IRISH LABORERS. 
Written by J. FosTra and sung with great success, by 
FOSTER & D1TDLEY. 
We are two Irish laborers, 
As you can plainly see ; 
From Donegal, we came when small, 
Unto Ameriky. 
We got work on the railroad, 
But sure it did'nt pay, 
go we got a 
job to carry the hod, 
At two and- a-half a 
day. 
CHORUS. 
Pat be quick! bring ut) the brick! 
The mortar too, likewise : 
Then push along, and sing a

And up the ladder rise ;

To be a 
mason's clerk. 
And have the man upon the 
Top of the house do all the work. 
When we go back to Ireland, 
That dear old Emerald Isle, 
Where the stranger finds a 
welcome, 
And is greeted with a 
smile; 
And if you ever want a 
friend, 
You need'nt try too hard— 
You can always find one 
In the Irish Boys that carry the hod. 
Pat be quick! 
Then here's success to Ireland! 
The land that gave us birth; 
The pride of every Irish heart. 
And the dearest spot on earth. 
Let every true born Irishman 
That has his feet well shod, 
Turn out in hono:: of the 
Lzish Boys that carry di° hod.

American Fortune-Telling Cards.—This is the old-

monds and Spades—and each of these into K for King, ct for queen, 
and K 
for Knave, and numbers 1, 3, to 10. 
The Cards are arranged in 
four rows, and are to be read according to directions. Many of the an-
swers depend upon the position certain cards bear to other cards. 
The 
method of playing is somewhat complicated, but the directions have 
been made so that very little study will suffice to an ordinary under-
standing. Many professional Furtune-Tellers use these cards, and we 
are in receipt of letters in relation to them from all parts of the U. S. 
Snclosed in handsome case.

Courting Cards. — This Series of Cards has been arranged 
1,1 meet a 
want frequently felt by young people—a 
want of means of 
expressing one's sentiments in such a 
way as to be non-committal. 
Many young ladies are visited by gentlemen who are either too din) , 
dent-cis-too fearful of a 
repulse, to venture upon asking the momentous 
qtrettion. 
The lady is restrained, by custom and a 
sense of propriety, 
from doing anything that would seem to be an unladylike encourage-
ment. As a 
result of this dilemma, many lives are spent as an unloved 
tedious existence, which might have been prolonged and enjoyed in the 
happiness of matrimony. Tale pack of Cards will overcome the diffi-
culty, and being in the shape of questions and answers, will cover every 
phase of courtship. The sentiments conveyed therein need not be 
adopted by the parties to the game as their own, unless it accords with 
the state of their affections, which fact makes a 
further explanation un-
necessary. The playing of these Cards is not restricted to two players, 
but may be enjoyed by evening parties

Read what two 
leading New York Papers say of it. 
The N. Y. Evening Mail writes: 
-‘ A 
Little Book has lately appeared in print at Mr. A. J. Fismtit's, No. 24 
Vesey Street, called the " Little Flirt." We cannot say that we recom 
mend it to our young lady and gentlemen readers, as we think it would 
only encourage the bad habit of " flirting." 
Unfortunatly, thore is 
enotigh of it done without any further necessity of explaining "how, 
when and where to do it," and this little volume would advise and initi-
ate the uncorrupted in practicing what is commonly called "flirting." 
The N. Y. Evening Telegram writes: " We have lately seen a 
neat little 
book, bound in Morrocco leather, costing twenty-five cents, called the 
"Little Flirt." published by A. J. FISHER, No. 24 Vesey Street. 
It 
gives information of the m odus operandi anteing, and ot' the meaning 
of every motion of the handkerchief, fan, glove and parasol. 
As there 
nothing at all objectionable in the volume, and its contents might 
afford some innocent amusement to many, we do not hesitate to recom. 
mend it to our yodn,g lady and gentlemen readers."

much entertainment in the way of harmless jokes, that all who have 
leisure should not neglect cultivating it 
Price 25 Cents. 
Napoleon's Oraculum.—A Verbatim Copy of the Lon-
don edition (originally published at the price of $5,00), which professes 
to be a 
perfect fac simile of the one used by NAPoLuoN, and consulted 
by him on every important occasion. Happy had it been for him had he 
abided by, or been ruled by the anewsrs of this Oracle. No farther lib-
erties have been taken in the translation, than merely to adapt it to the 
usages of this country. The questions being more numerous, and the 
answers more dirersifled than any edition ever before published in 
the United States, renders it much more valuable and interesting than 
any mutilated copy can ssossibly be.

adapted to all conditions of life; and persons of both sexes, whatever 
their situation or capacity, may with confidence refer to its pages to
