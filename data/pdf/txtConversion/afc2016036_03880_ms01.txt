Interview with Jim Mercer, April 13, 2017 
[0:00] 
Madeleine Hall-Arber: Okay. Is this— It would help if I plugged it in! [laughter] There, 
that's better. I was wondering why it was so quiet all of a sudden. Okay. So, this is April 13, 
2017, if s an interview for the New Bedford Fishing Heritage Center, funded by an Archie Green 
Fellowship, from the Library of Congress. As part of this project, we are interviewing shore side 
workers in the New Bedford/Fairhaven fishing industry to record their stories, document their 
skills and knowledge, and better understand their important role in the fishing industry. The 
recording and the transcript will become part of the permanent collection at the Library of 
Congress. I'm Madeleine Hall-Arber and today I'm speaking with Jim Mercer at, well, it was at 
Tia Maria's but we're not at Tia Maria's, [laughs] we're at New Bedford Heritage Center. And 
the time is 10:20. So. Jim can you just introduce yourself? 
Jim Mercer: James Allen Mercer, to be official. 
MH: And what i s your j ob ? 
JM: On a day to day basis I wait for phone calls, and take care of the fishing boats in the 
water. On the bottom, looking at propellers, the coolers, the intakes, the transducers, the zincs, 
and any other problems that they might run into along their trip. 
MH: So what kinds of things are you looking for? 
JM: Well, the obvious would be a rope in the propeller, which sounds simple to everybody else, 
but, a few extra barnacles, or any growth, or anything that possibly went through the propeller to 
disturb its function. Maybe like a bend, or something that wasn't there the last time. 
MH: So is that how people know to call you? Something's just not right with a — 
JM: Yeah— there's a checklist that the captains have, and it will just say diver on there, and the 
shore engineer will, will call me, or the owner will call me and say "Okay, you know, we got to 
check for the diver, let me know what everything's looking like." 
MH: So there's no real clue, if s kind of a mystery for you? 
JM: Yeah, it could be a mystery every time, every once in awhile they say, "Ok, the starboard 
side has a buoy attached to it," and I know to go look at that, get that buoy off of there. And the 
rope's attached to something on the bottom, or there's a wobble in the wheel and the propeller, 
and I'll know, okay, that's a pinpoint. But after that if s again, check the whole boat, just because 
you never know. Check the whole boat. 
MH: So even if you find something that's obvious and you fix that, you still check everything 
out while you're down there? 
JM: Yes. Yes. Yeah. Just to be sure. You know, if s got sometimes five or six, seven guys on it 
sometimes going out so something misplaced can be dangerous if we let it go. Or, if we didn't 
look at something and it dragged rope or whatever and it ended up by costing a lot more money 
in fuel— 
MH: Right. 
Interview with Jim Mercer, April 13, 2017 
JM: Probably one of the biggest things is keeping the boat smooth on the bottom, making sure 
that they're not burning extra fuel, and that takes out on the seven guys that the trip they have to 
pay for the fuel. 
MH: Sure. So how did you get started with this? 
JM: Probably family business was a dive and ski shop. 
MH: Oh! 
JM: So my dad stuck me in the water and in the ‘70s, I remember getting into a wet suit with 
some soapy water and squeezing into it. And that was — yeah the rest is just history. The first 
job I did was probably fourteen years old, I cleaned a couple of tug boats in Fairhaven, and that, I 
should have, that was a, that was a really tough job. I should have known [laughter^ from that 
that it was going to be tough but I always just enjoyed the — I enjoyed getting guys off and 
running. It's a good feeling when you, when you watch, watch, the boat go out and you just 
checked it and you know if s good, and so on. That being, being a necessity, is— I mean anybody 
is, in life, would want it to be a necessity, it's— if s needed. If s a much needed thing, it's not like 
they would they would, they got to 
[5:00] 
call somebody else if I don't answer — so yeah, if s a — fulfillment end of it is, is nice. 
MH: Yeah, yeah. Good. So we're going to back up for a few background questions first. Were 
you born here in New Bedford? 
JM: Westport. I grew up in Westport. 
MH: And when was that? When were you bom? 
JM: Nineteen seventy. Westport, Mass. 
MH: Okay. And what is your family ethnic heritage? 
JM: Lef s see, we've been going back and forth with that. Probably French-Canadian Indian, and 
English and Irish. So. 
MH: Have you ever done the swab to see — 
JM: My dad just did and he discovered that we're more Irish than... we were all laughing. 
[laughter^ We're more Irish than what we thought. But, yeah. Pretty much English and Irish 
and hopefully the French Canadian's not too far off My mom says, "We don't need the swab, 
thafs what we are." 
\laughter~\ 
MH: So your parents are from Westport as well? 
JM: Yes. Yes. 
Interview with Jim Mercer, April 13, 2017 
MH: And they grew up there? 
JM: My dad grew up in Tiverton, from a long line of swimmers, they were all swimmers back in 
the day. Pictures of my dad's whole family, the whole gamut, from eight years old all the way to 
fifteen or sixteen, and all my aunts and uncles, they swam long distance. 
MH: Wow. 
JM: Yeah, which was — if s pretty, if s pretty impressive. If s, if s, yeah they don't do that 
anymore. Neat stuff 
MH: Yeah, so, how did they get started with, well they were all swimmers, but what made them 
decide to go into the business? 
MJ: My mom's brother, was a diver, and actually got my dad into diving in the, ‘60s. Sometime 
MH: For recreational diving? 
JM: Yep, they said, lef s open up a store, and then my dad started teaching, sometime in the 
fifties, he was a dive instructor, and then that turned into many stores and then it kind of shrunk 
back down to the Fairhaven store. Fairhaven I think was, ’67, ‘66 possibly? On Main Street in 
Fairhaven? And then, yeah as it got you know my brother and I got older, and it got bigger, and 
we needed to get into the different seasons, and got into skiing, and the diving always stayed, it's 
always been the draw of the area. Being so many different, having so many different water 
seasons, if s really fun, there's the recreational diving, there's tautog in the spring, there's striper 
that come in in the summer, there's spearfishing, there's plenty of treasure hunting around here, 
and all different clarities, all the time you can swing to the Cape to get some cold clear water in 
the middle of the summer. If s a pretty unique area, the Northeast is fun, fun to dive. 
MH: Have you ever been outside of the Northeast diving? 
JM: Yes, yes. I go on vacation every year. The boats lose their days and their season sort of 
ends January and February, which is lucky for me, because I don't have to dive so often — 
MH: Yeah! [laughs] 
JM: Because if s super cold, but I go on trips down south, Puerto Rico, Costa Rica. I also surf 
along with spearfish, so yeah, my mask and snorkel always come with me, goes with me 
wherever I am. This year I traveled to Samoa, in the Pacific — 
MH: Really? 
JM: Absolutely beautiful, yeah, it's funny, you know I have extra stuff, dive belts, and dive 
gloves and whatnot. I'm always bringing the stuff just in case. And I met another diver, who 
spear fishes for the village in Samoa, and I practically brought him to tears, just giving him a 
weigh belt, some extra gloves, and yeah, it was kind of a good feeling, it was what my dad would 
have done if he had brought the dive groups down there. Because we traveled with the store, we 
traveled to a lot of different destinations, especially the Caribbean. All over the Caribbean 
actually, just diving in the 
Interview with Jim Mercer, April 13, 2017 
[10:00] 
super clear water in the summer, in the winter rather, and, kind of breaks up the, breaks up the 
winter. 
MH: Right! I would say. 
\laughter~\ 
JM: It's a must. 
MH: Yes! So, the most common task that you perform is — 
JM: I would say just an inspection, make sure that the propeller hasn't got rope tangled in it, if s, 
if s yeah, it's the first thing that I look at is the propeller. After that it would be, a good look at 
the coolers, so the, a lot of the larger boats if you see them out of the water they have these — if s 
basically a radiator. If s outside the boat, and if s very tough to paint because it has to disperse 
heat and if you paint it, it bothers the heat dispersion and the barnacles love to grow on 
it. Barnacles or worms or mussels or whatever you might have would bother the cooling and it — 
- the engines have all sorts of sensors and they’re constantly telling the captain if it, if if s at all 
over the mark to get the diver to look at it and that goes on his checklist. So it would be 
propeller, then the coolers, and then sometimes the obvious stuff, changing pipes on the inside, 
changing valves on the inside of the boat, they need me to block up the vents, stand by, they 
block them, they fix them. I'll take the blocking off, and then let it — see how everything works 
for them, on the inside. 
MH: So what kinds of equipment to you normally take down with you, when you go under? 
JM: Well I have a lot of trusty knives; I probably purchase four or five knives a week, because I 
found that trying to sharpen is just a waste of time. You need a nice new sharp 
knife. Unfortunately. To, A, get the job done quicker, and you know, to know when I get down 
there, okay there's this amount of rope, all right I'm going to need this amount of knives, and if s, 
then if s consistent that way. Or if I have a different knife or even maybe something will work 
better, then my, my times are off I try to spend an hour on a boat. Every once in awhile it goes 
to two hours, it can be — I'll know when I get down there, okay there this amount of rope, I can't 
see the propeller, if s going to be more than an hour. So yeah, knives... there's a whole array of 
scrapers that I have that that get the job done, some of them, some of them look a little funny 
they've been bent up pieces of metal that I found work. It, unlike, like a paint scraper scraping a 
house, they need to be a little bit stronger because barnacles are really stuck on, and working 
under water you need to, you need a little bit smaller, scraper circumference, that way I'm not 
getting tired. Sometimes two or three boats a day, will just beat you up and make you exhausted 
for the following day, so — 
MH: Sure. So how do you communicate, when you go down to check out what's going on, and 
say you have to block it up for them to do the pipe thing, do you have a set amount of time? Or 
is there some way to communicate? 
JM: There's usually a set amount of time, there's always an — in that case there's always an 
extra guy and believe it or not I can hear them talking when they're inside the boat. They can't 
Interview with Jim Mercer, April 13, 2017 
hear me talking obviously because I'm under the water but a quick knock, or a couple of knocks 
and they bang back usually, usually way too loud. They knock back and then we come up and 
say, you know, is it working? Yeah, whether it's working or not. We'll go back down and try to 
fix the vent, and try to fix the block and get things rolling. 
MH: Sounds interesting. 
JM: It is! It is, if s a 
[15:00] 
unique job and if s what I like. What I like is discovering other jobs like, you know everybody 
knows that there's a painter, and everybody knows that there's a wire guy, and there's, but there's 
— if s endless it seems like, as long as I have been doing it. I’m like, oh! Thaf s what that guy 
does! And if s another quirky little thing that, that gets a ten million dollar boat up and running to 
go get you know, two hundred thousand dollars worth of scallops or fish or whatever you might 
have. If s a, if s unique, if s a pretty neat industry to be in. 
MH: Yeah, it's one of the things I've loved about studying the fishing industry. It’s just — 
people have no idea. 
\laughter~\ 
JM: No! None at all! And just yesterday I drove down the docks and I was trying to describe to 
somebody what the doors did. What do you mean those go in the water? And you look at the 
things and you go, oh, it's just a fishing boat, and yeah they don't go out with a hook and a 
worm! [laughter^ If s a little more complicated. And the guys that do fish I don't even think, 
unless they took somebody out with them and explained it word for word as they were doing it — 
- if s, if s complicated. 
MH: Yeah. Yeah. 
JM: If s not something that you just pick up on, the guys that have been doing it, have been 
doing it for many years, they — first they welded on the docks, and then they — helped clean the 
boat, then, and then you get a job on the boat, and then you know you're still a green fisherman 
for a little while, but the guys, that most of the guys that are captains, did all those jobs to work 
up to, to work up to captain. You know you don't just like walk on a boat and become a 
captain. 
MH: Yeah. 
JM: Neat. Neat stuff 
MH: So do you end up working on both trawlers and scallop boats? 
JM: Yes. Lobster, trawlers, occasional recreational boats, scallop boats — 
MH: Clam boats? 
JM: Yep, yep. Yeah there's... when the, when the guy calls, I know whether if s a scallop boat or 
a clam boat or whatnot, but if somebody calls that I don't know I'm on my way, whether what 
Interview with Jim Mercer, April 13, 2017 
kind of boat it might be, it doesn't matter. Most commercial boats, they're going to get taken care 
of 
MH: So are there many other divers around? 
JM: Yeah, there's a fair amount of divers. It's kind of funny, a lot of them my dad has taught 
through the years. We all know each other, we’re all super friendly with each other, there's no, 
there's no hard feelings you know, you understand that you can't be there all the time. They all 
dislike me because I go on vacation in February and they have to cover my jobs, [laughter^ But, 
that’s okay, but — a cool neat group of guys, some of them are firemen, some are policemen, 
they, they are all, we're all on board with the same thing, just trying to get the job done, and get 
people on their way, you know? 
MH: Have you ever had, had to help recover somebody? 
JM: No. Not in the recovery business. My dad told me about when he first started, they, they 
asked him and he tried it once and he said, no, no, no. He said, “From now on I'm going to 
teach. I'll teach all the policemen and the firemen and they can go do that because thaf s what 
their job is.” So yeah. I've helped train some of the guys for search and rescue but not, not 
actually going and going and done it. Just to make sure it's orchestrated correctly, they have a 
super large amount of training that they do and practice dives and sometimes it's as small as 
finding a coffee cup and they, they find it, because it's eight guys and they grid things out, and — 
MH: Wow. 
JM: Yeah. Neat but never got into that. 
MH: Yeah. 
JM: Never got into that. Salvage stuff, I did get into boats that sunk. I kind of got my name on 
the books for such stuff cause you know, boats sink right at the dock, and then all of the sudden 
guys are saying, “Who is this guy?” You know, you’re saving the day, blocking stuff up, and 
pumping the boat out, making it float again 
[20:00] 
and get that off and on their way. 
MH: Yeah. It amazes me, I mean I know that boats sink and they are able to bring them back up 
and get them working again, but it, it, when you are land based, it's hard to imagine that 
something can really— 
JM: Yeah. 
MH: — be recovered. \laughs\ 
JM: There's a lot of — if you — I always, you know I got a few boats in my yard, and I'm 
always working on boats, and then diving on boats, but I, I envy the guys that have — that own 
five boats, and they're in their coveralls and they have a checklist of five boats that they have to 
go through, a tremendous responsibility of — fifteen or twenty, maybe even thirty or forty guys 
Interview with Jim Mercer, April 13, 2017 
that go out on those boats. Checking and rechecking intakes and valves and engines, and just 
changing oil to — for the small easy stuff that we would understand. 
MH: Mm hmm. 
JM: You know the motors need oil changes. Some of some of the engines on the boats are 
thirty and forty years old because somebody changed the engine oil every time they went out, 
back and forth. So that the list that they have, maybe if s on a piece of paper, maybe if s just, in 
their head, taking care of stuff and making it- making it come back to port is tremendous. That 
gives me, that gives me, the go- to you know, when they call, I get right there, I- and then I'm off 
their checklist. They know what the bottom looks like, they know everything’s okay. If it's not 
okay, I tell them and, you shoot them off but checklists are very important. There's a lot of, 
there's a lot of thought that goes into how much work and hopefully they have a life other than 
that but if s, I don’t know if I — if s a large, large amount of work. And head work to make sure 
stuff is okay. 
MH: So do you confine most of your work in the New Bedford/Fairhaven area or do you go 
farther afield? 
JM: Funny you say that. Just couple days ago I was in Wickford. One of the tugboats that was 
in New Bedford had a job at a marina over the winter. They dredged out the marina, and he was 
there for an extra long period of time. The marina couldn't haul him cause he's too big of a 
tugboat and he said, he called me up and he said, "Jim, I got to have you come down, do you 
mind coming to Wickford?" So occasionally I'll, I'll run to Wickford, or Connecticut, or 
couple boats in Hyannis that I take care of, but I try to stick close to New Bedford/ 
Fairhaven. When I'm called it's usually twenty minutes that I got to, I got to get there in twenty 
minutes. That way I'm off the checklist, that way they can move on to the next oil change or 
whatever it might be. 
MH: Right. And how does the way — you mentioned the dry suit, can you just describe what 
kind of suit you wear and what time of year? 
JM: Yeah. Well the suit thickness goes by millimeters. Lefs see, I have a seven mil dry suit 
which is the thickest, and that would be up until about now, which is April. I'll be taking that off 
shortly, hopefully, but right now I'm in my warmest drysuit. I can wear regular clothes or maybe 
some like thick pajamas underneath, and thaf s going to keep me pretty comfy. Water can't touch 
me. If I have a little cut in the glove, which usually the gloves are three fingered mitts, it’s seven 
millimeter. If I have 
[25:00] 
a little cut in the glove I need a new pair of gloves. And I’ll, I'll save them for later. And then as 
it warms up. I'll go to six mil, and a five mil, and a four mil. I got the whole, the whole 
gamut. End up with a lot of suits, end up with a lot of gear. When it, when it comes down to it, 
if something’s wet and cold from two or three hours ago. I'll put the warm dry one on, so that I 
know that I'm going to be safe and warm for the next job. In case it runs into a little bit of 
time. So that in the summer I'll finally get to the wet suits, and the wet suits can be pretty thin, 
same millimeters, four millimeters but wet, and I'm safe. If I go too thin, I end up poking myself 
with barnacles because they can cut right through the neoprene. 
Interview with Jim Mercer, April 13, 2017 
MH: Huh! 
JM: Yeah, they're durable, and I bum through those also, probably two or three suits a year, with 
the wet suits, depending on if I get a tougher job that really beats them up, but it, some jobs I go, 
okay, it's time to get a new suit. 
MH: Yeah. 
JM: That way I'm happy going to the next one. There's no reason to be cold and miserable 
doing your job. It's got to be, some of my friends have been like, “Well it looks like a really nice 
suit!” They can't — well I got to spend six hours in it today so if s got to be nice! It can't be 
ratty. 
MH: Yeah. So do you go by the temperature of the water or do you just know the season? 
JM: Yeah, I'm in it so much, from day to day, if I'll get a warm day outside in the colder season I 
can go to a thinner suit, but April/May it starts to warm up and I'll start to see my jellyfish that 
are a telltale sign of warming up and I know I can, I know I can go and look at that suit that's 
been in storage all winter and say "okay. I'm getting ready to use you pretty soon." And if if s a 
real warm day I have to jump down to a cooler suit because you can overheat also very 
easy. Seven mil, dry, if s very cumbersome, and if you have to do a lot of work with it, it can 
make you overheat fast. 
MH: Can you describe the difference between a wetsuit and dry suit? I mean — 
JM: Yeah. 
MH: Seems obvious, but — 
JM: Yeah, seems obvious but if s funny but the dry suits have a — sometimes they look like a 
bag. They call them bag suits, looks like a bag; if s real heavy nylon. And a dry zipper across 
the back, with, with seals on the wrist and neck, and usually boots attached. I use a neoprene dry 
suit, which are much, they look like a wetsuit, but there's a layer in between the neoprene that’s 
pressed and completely waterproof All the seams are sewn and extra glued. Same zipper across 
the back with seals on the wrist and neck. The hood — my hair will get damp. The hoods aren't 
really completely dry but I have a full face mask that doesn’t let, again, doesn't let any water, no 
water touching me. 
MH: Really? 
JM: Yeah. So I get wet on the hands, and damp on the head and everything else is, unless I 
poked a hole in it, everything — when I'm getting out of the water I'm completely dry. And just 
go with the clothes I have on. A wet suit, much different. Snug fitting. Most, most people know 
wetsuits are snug fitting, the water warms up in between you and the suit, and you keep that 
water in there to keep your warmth. Less cumbersome, way more mobility in a wet suit. Thank 
God because the summer I'm usually busy and I'm in and out of, up and down ladders a lot more 
than in the winter, so I'm not as tired with a wet suit. Wet suit season is coming up soon, and I 
kind of can't wait for it. 
MH: Do you have to have any kind of certification? 
Interview with Jim Mercer, April 13, 2017 
JM: Yeah, yeah- you definitely need — having my dad as a dive instructor growing up, 
[30:00] 
and then myself being an instructor Dive Con Helper, it's like a dive instructor helper, there was 
so many people that are instructors allowed in a class. Let’s say the number is six, and if you go 
to seven, you don't want to turn that person down, but if you have a Dive Con Instructor Helper 
with you, you can go to seven or eight — 
MH: I see. 
JM: Yeah just pretty much, all the way to the certification, all the way to teaching. It's Open 
Water Diver, Advanced Open Water Diver, you go through all your specialties. Specialty with 
Search and Rescue, and then Dive Con Helper. Yes, you need a, some sort of certification to get 
your tank fills, but as far as diving underneath the boats- a lot of knowledge and no certain 
certification for it, but a lot of knowledge and a lot of — you're talking to people that own 
sometimes multiple tens of millions of dollar boats, and I've always said this, that they know 
who they're talking to, and they want the job done, and they see through any kind of 
phoniness. You know they know that I'm, I'm giving them an honest answer. I'm really looking 
at the boat. If they want video and pictures I get them that. If they want the rope that I cut out I 
get them that. It's- it's an anything type of call when they do call. No, no certification for diving 
underneath the boats but I do- but I have had certifications in the past. Plenty of them. 
MH: Have you ever run into anybody else trying to do the boats that really doesn’t know what 
they're doing? 
JM: No, what you got to realize is the boats. I'll say this, the guy — some people take their car to 
the wrong mechanic. These guys that own these boats are definitely not dummies. And I've said 
it before but I'll say it again, they see through B.S. So they know, and they might appease 
somebody and actually give them money to go and look at it, but shortly after they're calling me 
or somebody that's dove for them before that knows what they're talking about. It's a lot of lingo, 
and a lot of stuff- different words. I have a friend of mine that writes books, she says, "What was 
that word you just used? [laughs] I mean it's kind of funny and I said, "Oh it's a nozzle." She 
says, “Where's the nozzle on a boat?” Yeah, it's a- there's different things you have to know and 
the owners know them, and it's second nature to us, but some people just don't know that stuff 
you can't go and dive on a boat without the knowledge. 
MH: So did you learn that terminology from your father? 
JM: Let's see. From my dad, from just wanting to know about the boats, and growing up- the 
store was, about two blocks from Kelly's shipyard, which is now Fairhaven shipyard. And 
walking by a boat out of the water, anybody quickly learns that there's a lot of stuff under there 
and it's not just a big smooth boat with a propeller. There's rudders, and court nozzles, and zincs, 
and you got to ask a lot of questions, when I was a little guy I would ask those questions, and 
they always just stuck. 
MH: Huh. 
Interview with Jim Mercer, April 13, 2017 
JM: Yeah, what makes the propeller spin, and simple stuff. You know some guys are into the 
tractors, and whatnot, but I was always into the boats, the bottom of the boats. 
MH: What are zincs? 
JM: Zincs are sacrificial metal thaf s connected to a big steel hull, so that the steel 
[35:00] 
doesn't corrode. The zincs corrode hopefully within a couple of years. They get, they get low 
and they need to be replaced. It's usually about the time that they have to haul out. But 
occasionally with all the work that's going on, and different docks have different currents, under 
the water, so good boat, bad boat, and then your boaf s in between and salt water conducts... 
MH: Right. 
JM: So, the zincs get eaten a little bit faster than normal and they need to be replaced. 
MH: Oh my goodness. 
JM: Yeah like a twenty-four pound plate of zinc, and I believe zinc is nickel and lead. And it's, 
if s softer and gets eaten before the steel does, before the brass propeller. You know, a lot of 
people, if s kind of funny, a lot of people don't realize that numbers on a fancy propeller 
nowadays is in upwards of seventy or eighty thousand dollars. And you know, most people don't 
spend that on their boats, but alone the propeller for your boat! So you keep, you keep that, you 
keep looking at that. You have the diver look at it while you can't, you know two years is a long 
time to not see the bottom — 
MH: Yeah. 
JM: — If you want a picture of it, then the diver gets you a picture, or sometimes I'll take the 
zinc off and I'll go "Okay, this is what it looks like,” and they have a piece of mind and they can 
move on to their list. 
MH: Right. So have you noticed-1 know that in the past that people hauled their boat practically 
every year, before the blessing for example. Now people aren't doing it as frequently, right? 
JM: I think that the schedule, is about a year and a half to two and a half years? A haul out can 
cost I'd say twenty to seventy thousand dollars depending on what you're doing. So, there has to 
be money in the bank to complete such a task. They make stuff- paint jobs, when they do paint it 
up, zincs, when they add zincs, they make stuff last a little longer for different guys. Some guys 
have not quite double the zincs, but they got an exorbitant amount of zincs. Different boats will 
sandblast the bottom every ten years, instead of every fifteen, and it's taking care of a vessel 
thaf s making them money, so they're putting money back into it. I don't think if s been any 
different. I think probably from recreational boating, yeah, they're going to haul out every year 
because they're not staying in. But the shipyard's got its hands full, there's always boats above 
and then in the summer it seems like a lot of fancy boats will come in and they try to separate the 
two shipyards. And they're busy. And a lot of people don't realize. New Bedford's a port thaf s 
known, there's a few shipyards in Gloucester whatever, but there's a whole another couple of four 
or five ports that travel here just to get hauled out, just to get worked on, because they can handle 
Interview with Jim Mercer, April 13, 2017 
the size of the boat. And then you can go to four to five different guys to weld on it. You can go 
to you know whoever's not busy to get it done quicker in case their days are coming up and they 
need to head out there quicker. 
MH: Right. 
JM: Yeah, a lot of service, you know, along with the diver that comes within twenty 
minutes! [laughter^ And gives him bad news that they have to haul out! [laughs] But yeah, 
they- there's a lot. If s a busy little- if s a busy little beehive. 
MH: The zincs are attached near the propeller? 
JM: All over the boat. Near the propeller, there's a little bit more than further up, but further up 
the coolers will have their own zincs 
[40:00] 
and then next to the coolers will be zincs, next to intakes, sometimes in intakes there'll be 
zincs. So any of the water thaf s going in is not corroding any of the parts on the inside. There's 
a — on a sixty, seventy foot boat there's probably in the neighborhood of forty to fifty zincs, 
strewed throughout. 
MH: Huh. I didn't realize that. Now the intakes are for water? 
JM: Yeah, some engines run on raw water to cool them, some engines have the coolers to cool 
them. So water would be some engines and any kind of wash down, any kind of- anything to 
keep the boat clean would be a wash down pump. Let's see what else — mostly wash down 
stuff And they're bigger holes than what they need to be sometimes. It's a spooky thing, you 
got an eight inch sea chest, which is just kind of like what you'd imagine it to be, a pretty big box 
underneath the boat and then from that box there will be a setup for a pipe for a wash down 
pump and a pipe for a toilet or a pipe for a sink. Something to cool an engine, four or five pipes 
off of a sea chest, so that there's not, so that there's always enough water feeding those 
systems, they'll have a pretty good sized hole. They try to keep it down to just one hole, but if s 
usually a little bit bigger one. 
MH: Huh. It surprises me that they use intake for- of seawater for cooling the engine because I 
would have thought that corrosion would be an issue. 
JM: Some engines, not all of them, but they'll have a heat exchanger, so raw water is constantly 
running through an exchanger that has antifreeze inside of it. 
MH: I see. 
JM: Yeah, a little bit, a little bit tricky. I just know boats, [laughter^ So you got raw water 
going in and out and it never touches antifreeze or oil or anything. It's just going in and out and 
across these little fins — 
MH: I see. 
JM: —similar to the coolers on the outside, but just an internal system. 
Interview with Jim Mercer, April 13, 2017 
MH: Now do you ever, do they ever have problems with a hole that feeds the sea chest? 
JM: Yeah. Yeah. And I'm always-1 show up sometimes I show up with my suit on, sometimes 
it's off, but the first thing I do if I know we need to change one of the valves out on a sea chest, 
the first thing I'm doing is going in the boat, finding out right where it is, how big, how much 
work they got, if they got all the parts and pieces, lined up, and these guys got a pretty good 
sized list so they're they are usually spot on with that. But they can run into- they can run into 
trouble like, okay, we need to weld that so it needs to be completely blocked up. You need to 
have a metal shield on whatever's blocking it. Because you just can't put like, lef s say a plastic 
bag to block up a small pipe if they're going to start welding. The drips are going to — 
MH: A little melt? [laughs'] 
JM: Yeah, so you're going to mix the- make a problem there. So yeah. I'm down there and I 
figured the job out in my head and how it's going to go, and then I go underneath. If s like the 
easy part for me is to go underneath, check the different intakes, see what it might 
be. Sometimes there's little tiny holes, or sometimes there's a grate that can be removed, so I 
remove the grate, put a large balloon inside and blow it up, stop the water, and then they can 
work and do their thing. Tap, stand by, a little excess water spills out, they tap back, everything's 
okay, come up top side to the guy that's hanging overboard, and I say "Okay, is everything 
alright?" And he goes and checks with them, and we get another okay, and then I get out and 
watch them do it. 
MH: Uhhuh. 
JM: So that I'm learning, all the time. It might be a- it might be a huge valve, or I don't know 
how they get them 
[45:00] 
to match up sometimes, but there's these big old valves that are- you know are two or three or 
five bolts and they, they line them up just right and get that same one to go right back in 
there. They need them to- the Coast Guard needs them to turn on and off freely, all the time- so 
as soon as they get a little sticky they replace them. And that's another thing, you know people 
always say, throw another thousand dollars at a boat. It's easily six, seven hundred dollars for a 
small valve, and small I mean like six or four or five, six inches, and sometimes these valves are 
ten inch. They're very expensive you know the whole crew of guys that are there helping to 
replace it along with the diver. There's sometimes- that alone is a, is an exorbitant course, cost of 
just a valve change. 
MH: Right, right. When- when- where- how might I ask this question? I've heard of a 
lazarette, and I know that that can be a problem sometimes with leaks. Is that the same thing that 
we're talking about, going into the sea chest? 
JM: No, there's not usually a sea chest in the lazarette. A lazarette's just the back half- if it's 
partitioned, and if there's a couple of hatches, that's the requirements for the word lazarette. So it 
needs to be partitioned from the very back of the boat and usually the rudder post and if s just 
usually the rudder post. The rudder post comes up out of the lazarette, and all the working pieces 
for the rudder which you know makes the boat move, is back there and there's- if s usually kept 
Interview with Jim Mercer, April 13, 2017 
very clear, because you don't want anything disturbing the rudder. That's how they steer the 
boat- so if was in rough seas and they had stuff piled up around it, it would you know, fall and 
disturb it. But thaf s kept really clear, most of the time, when I'm dealing with rudder problems 
in the lazarette I'll go down inside the lazarette and they say, “All right, we need this to be on 
center.” Because they're not sure where the rudder is. And if s a super fun easy job for me, cause 
I go down and I say "Okay! If s at one o'clock or if s at eleven o'clock, or ifs hard over, and they 
just they spin it sometimes-1 move it to where it's center, they mark it, and then they go from 
there. Rudder posts are not usually leaking. They're, they’re usually pretty sealed up back 
there. They got that down pretty well. Thaf s a- if s a good size hole if the rudder was to come 
out but there's too many failsafes for it to do such a thing. Sea chest is usually in the engine 
room. That way you can feed the water systems right from, right from the engine room; they 
keep it all, keep it all there. 
MH: So have you worked on old wooden boats as well as the metal? Steel? 
JM: I have, I have. I have worked on old wooden boats. Whole different thing comes into play 
usually with the old wooden boats. The guys looking for plank rot of any kind. Or damage that's 
rubbed up against— yeah, other than just looking around for too much wear and tear, they're, 
they're fairly similar. Sometimes the wooden boats have a different structure, so the engine 
room's further back- but most of them, most of the time if s fairly similar. 
MH: Hm. Okay, let's see. So, you talked about a number of things about what you like about 
the job. What is the hardest part? 
JM: What is the hardest part. The hardest part is- having right about now when the water needs 
to be warmer [laughter^ and it should be getting warm soon but it, it doesn't seem like it wants 
to! And I'm just back from a warm tropical place. If s- there's, there's not too many really hard 
parts. I dislike when it rains 
[50:00] 
and the water clarity is very dirty. The reason for that is not because I'm scared of the dark or 
anything, it's-1 can miss something very easily. You know when the visibility is- you got to 
look at a seventy or eighty foot boat, on the bottom, and it's- the visibility is two feet and I have 
two lights with me. I can easily swim by an intake or a cooler, and I know a lot of the boats. I 
always, I kind of have little rhymes that go with different boats and, and you know. The- the 
Frontier for instance, has a- it has a cooler that's as large as a frontier. It's huge and if s really 
hard to clean, and I go uh-oh. I have little rhymes like that that go in different boats but knowing 
all the boats is next to impossible. So when the water is very dirty, I dislike it because I can miss 
something. You hate to miss something, and I ask more questions when I come up, just in case, 
because I say, “Hey, the watef s dirty. What can we do? You know, how many coolers this boat 
might have?” Or anything thaf 11 clue me in which they usually know. So "five coolers” and I'll 
go count them all, check them all. I've done jobs before the guy says, "You know it has two 
propellers?" and I was like, "What!" I only looked at one! Because the visibility is so bad that 
I've swam right by the other propeller and it just seems absurd. But then I remember, "Thaf s the 
boat with two propellers!" [laughter^ If s Vila Nova do Corvo II so it has two propellers! So I 
make sure we look at both of them next time! My little rhymes! 
Interview with Jim Mercer, April 13, 2017 
MH: Do you ever just out of, or interest, see the bottom and like, not just the boat, but the sea 
floor and see what's going on there? 
JM: Fairhaven's fairly shallow when if s- when it's clear. I'm always- Fairhaven I'm always 
touching the bottom whether it's clear or not. But when it's clear I can definitely see, take a good 
look at the bottom. A lot of the boats are probably in the neighborhood of ten foot draft which at 
the very bottom of the boat it’s ten feet. And they're in twelve feet of water sometimes. So 
there's a little space underneath you can kind of wiggle through. And they're not bouncing up 
and down so that's not really dangerous. I've never put myself in a dangerous position either. It's 
all dangerous, but there's double checks and rechecks, and a lot of stuff to make sure I come out 
and do the next job. But yeah the bottom's pretty interesting. There's a lot of stuff on the 
bottom. If I had to- if I had to say it right off the bat I'd say it looks like a junkyard. There's 
plenty of fish and whatnot living around on the bottom. There's plenty of seals, cleaning up the 
fish. Yeah the bottom's neat. The bottom is an interesting area. Occasionally guys will have me 
find keys or phones [laughter^ and those are always fun jobs because I usually show up and hold 
my breath and if I know the dock real well I show up and hold my breath and I'm done in fifteen 
seconds. And the other guy's like- you wouldn't believe how happy somebody could be that I 
found their keys. I always tell guys, just keep a big something on the keys. Don't do- a single 
key would be impossible to find — 
MH: Right! 
JM: As long as if s a big clump of keys and a majority of the guys that I find keys for have more 
keys than I have cars, thaf s for sure. They have a large clump of keys! 
MH: And what kinds of hours do you normally work? I know you said you try to keep each 
boat to about an hour, but say in a course of a day, or in the course of a week? 
JM: In the course of a week. I'm happy with- I'm happy with two boats a day. That would have 
a nice ring. Because of weather, it doesn't work like that. Because of weather, and when they're 
going in and out, and when they are losing days, and sometimes 
[55:00] 
some of the guys are really late. Like, “I just went through the dike, but I need you to come and 
look.” Or very early like, "Hey! Next Tuesday the boat’s going out so you can look at it any 
time in between." So I schedule, I say, oh good, I can schedule that boat. Hopefully if s on a 
slower day. Where- when there's good weather and everybody's fishing I'll be- I’ll have a fairly 
busy day. Weekly, I would say, twelve hours, which doesn't seem like much, but thaf s just the 
water time, that's not the heading down. And twelve boats weekly are- they, they keep me out of 
trouble. But it can rain. Sometimes I don't do boats three days in a row, so I keep myself busy 
with my own boats. Sometimes just helping people with their boats. That’s my other half 
MH: Do you ever work in the store? 
JM: I used to work in the store, I tell people I'm retired from retail. I worked from when I was 
eleven years old to thirty-three, which was 2003 I stopped completely working in retail. If s, it's 
nice, I miss it a little bit, and I occasionally, I don't get paid but occasionally I'll swing through 
when I'm filling my scuba tanks at the store, and help my brother out. He's in the weeds, and 
Interview with Jim Mercer, April 13, 2017 
there's too many people around and I'll clear this guy out or clear that guy out or just watch for, 
watch for people going in and out for him, and especially around the busy times. But no, I try 
not to, I try not to work retail. My sister and I have a funny joke and, we said, nope, no more 
retail for us! She worked retail forever and now she's a schoolteacher and she says if s so nice 
not doing anything on Saturday! [laughs] It's so nice just going yard sailing, not having to go 
open up the store, you know? 
MH: So how did it that your brother ended up doing the work? 
JM: Um, my brother's a little bit older than me, he always had a passion for the store, and I was, 
I started, let’s see, I started in ninety-three-1 started commercial fishing for myself, and in the 
summers. So I kind of picked and choose when I wanted to work, so I always got that 
hashtag. That's fine, yeah I didn't really want to get into the retail thing, it was being around it so 
much, and having- putting heart and soul into it and realizing, you don't really get that much out 
of it, I said no, I got to do, do something else for myself So winters were at the store, and then 
summers were commercial fishing for myself, and I started that in ninety-three, and just I, I kept 
up with that. I think the store would have been- the store would have been nice if we went into, I 
would have stayed if we went into different avenues. But just sticking with the skiing and the 
diving, he did the college and the business thing so he ended up with the store and I-1 went on 
my way, but it was fun, it was nice to do. 
MH: So you have two, a younger brother and a sister, you have any others? 
JM: I have two sisters, one brother. 
MH: Ah-ha! What does your other sister do? 
JM: My other sister is a dance studio owner. She owns like an onstage academy of performing 
arts in Fall River. And occasionally I've helped her out. Thaf s another super happy thing to 
do. She had a- she recently just did Peter Pan and I was kind of bummed out because I only got 
to make a walking stick and a bow and arrow that looked fancy onstage and it worked out well 
because I made it-1 made it extra fancy but in years past I did Peter Pan and I was the alligator, 
across stage in a big costume. My sister's love is teaching kids and she's been doing it, I think 
thirty-five years and if s funny now some of her 
[1:00:00] 
first dance kids are bringing their kids in, she's like "Oh this is really neat!" She has many girls 
that are doctors and lawyers and they've done really well. She's done really well with it. 
MH: Thaf s really nice. 
JM: Yeah, yeah. My younger sister's a schoolteacher and, same thing, puts her heart and soul 
into it. Our dad taught us to put heart and soul into everything so — you know he'll call me up 
and I'll be talking and I'll say "Okay, I got to talk to this owner" and before I can say bye he's 
already hanging up he'll say "Okay! I'll let you go!" [slams hands] And it- you know, he knows 
that he knows that an owner means business so — 
MH: Yeah. 
Interview with Jim Mercer, April 13, 2017 
JM: He knows the business thing and it's, it's like, go, he's telling me to go without even having 
to say it. "Okay I’ll let you go!" And he's already hanging up. I say, "So I only saw him, he was 
coming, I thought he was going to approach me!" The weekly- the daily conversation with my 
dad gets interrupted by an owner, a boat owner. 
MH: So how do you get paid? Does the owner pay you directly? 
JM: No, no. I got my trusty slip book. I'll get a slip out to the settlement house ladies, and the 
settlement house puts me in their little file as the next trip, and once the next trip all that stuff 
gets paid for, or the trip before. Some of them- it's, it's hard when I first started doing it, thank 
God I knew the business end of things. But some people pay thirty, sixty, ninety days, and some 
people pay quarterly, so there's, you know, guys will scream and cry, "I'm not getting paid!" But 
they- they're still here, they're going to pay. Some are a little bit longer than others, that's 
another neat thing, there's one, two, three, four, I think five, settlement houses, and I think boats 
have their own in different places, that I have to email or whatever. But I'll write out my slip and 
they want, a lot of them want a detailed slip. That way they're reminded again, or they can look 
back at it- a detailed slip of what I did, what I looked at, what the zincs were. That way they can 
check back if something's going bad fast or what they were the last time the diver looked. They 
go out to the settlement house and the settlement house ladies just mail me a check. 
MH: Are any of the settlement houses easier to work with than others? Or are they all about the 
same? 
JM: Oh no, they're all super nice. And if I said that one of them was bad, I wouldn't get 
paid! No- [laughter^ it's a- it's a good part of the day. You get to go and josh around with the 
ladies. I'm a big flirt so I flirt with the ladies and they're always super nice and helpful. If there's 
a boat that they might not even take care of, they know how to get the slip or the bill out to that 
boat, so that you know they're really, really knowledgeable as far as that stuff goes. Any 
question you ask them they'll help you. Just recently I needed some lawyer stuff written up and 
you know, I asked-1 asked one of them and she had three people to write, write about and to talk 
to about a write up, for a will and whatnot, and I was like, wow they're anything ladies. They 
know their stuff, but they will help you with anything and everything they can. 
MH: Yeah, I have a great interview with one of them. Very knowledgeable, very friendly. 
JM: Right. Right. They're- they're go to, they're go-getters. And you think about it, they're 
dealing with, I can't even wrap my head around what they have. I said, "Are you guys this 
boat? Are you guys that boat?" And they go "No," and they know the other, they know where 
it's going, because I'll forget occasionally you know — 
MH: Yeah. And has the technology changed over the years, in the way it's affected you in 
anything? 
JM: Some of the newer diesel engines I would say that would be- that would be the first, the 
first thing that I felt 
[1:05:00] 
Interview with Jim Mercer, April 13, 2017 
was- the computers on the diesel engines are very- finicky, they have to be right at a certain 
temperature. So, the guy driving the boat, if that's a new engine to him, he's saying "Okay, this is 
overheating!" When it- probably there was more tolerance in the past and now he's now- going 
down looking at the cooler and I hope it wasn't a thing- it might have been a silly rope that made 
the you know just a small piece of rope that will make the engine overheat. So yeah, technology 
helps. As far as my gear goes, technology helps a lot. There's much brighter lights, there's way 
easier video equipment. I can hook up and email an owner in Florida a picture of his propeller, 
in, you know, while I'm still wet. So it's- that's nice. 
MH: So do you use your phone for your video? Or do you have — 
JM: No, the phone will bluetooth to the camera, and the cameras- they work very well under 
dark conditions nowadays. Just the — exactly what I'm seeing. And you know you can freeze 
frame stuff and just send pictures. I'll go and video the whole thing and then pull out what I need 
to get, to get the right shot. 
MH: How did you learn how to do all of that? 
JM: Oh, my recreation is surfing so I've always wanted to get a good shot of surfing, and 
underwater photo stuff is so much fun. Just taking pictures of fishes and whatnot. When I was 
in grade school I would-1 always won the competition that the photo thing because I was the one 
with the underwater shot. So nobody else had one so it didn't matter what it was I think when 
you were in fifth grade it didn't really matter. I- I've always just kept in tune with that kind of 
stuff Luckily my brother allows me to go along with him to the dive shows, to check out new 
equipment. Super, super fun. Very, just different things that I know, I know I can go back and 
go, oh if I need that, I can get it. 
MH: Yeah. 
JM: Underwater grinder. Underwater drill. Metal detectors that you know, just look like a 
flashlight. The stuff is constantly changing at these new shows. At these shows, the new stuff 
is- it's readily available. Any kind of photo equipment, anything that will help you out, get the 
job done, cutters and knives, sometimes, [laughs] 
MH: Do you have any go to place for getting your knives? You said you get them so 
frequently? 
JM: If I'm in Fairhaven the Euro store over there, and if I'm New Bedford side I'm at-1 go to 
Luzo. So and sometimes the ship store right next to us here. The one that's right out here. 
MH: Ship Supply? 
JM: New Bedford Ship Supply, yeah. It's wherever I'm closest to-1 got to get-1 walk in with a 
wet suit [laughs] and the money in the hand, so. 
MH: You mentioned a couple times about people using up their days. So has that affected 
you? The regulations on the boats? 
JM: I'd like to say yeah. There was one year I kept track of stuff and I said the following year, I 
said, “I got less jobs this year as far as the commercial boats go but-1 got more with the 
Interview with Jim Mercer, April 13, 2017 
recreation.” So I'm kept okay, but then what I noticed was different times of the year, I always 
thought like, "Oh July would be my busy." If s not the case. Different times of the year, and 
now I can almost graph- you can probably graph it around when the barnacles grow, and then 
when they lose their days the boats have to sit longer. 
MH: Right. 
JM: So if the boaf s always moving around, it's going to be cleaner. And then they're going to 
call the diver. Because he's moving around and run stuff over and they're going to check things 
out. If the boat's sitting, they're going to call the diver after it's sat, and I'm going to put more 
time on the boat, because it has that much more. 
[1:10:00] 
Yeah. There's a few- there's a few tools I can do to make things quicker, there's probably some 
super sanding grinder thing that will make the propeller like new, that I've been looking into and 
power washers and whatnot, but the amount of sanding and grinding that's done it is usually by 
hand is much more efficient. 
MH: Mmm. 
JM: \laughs\ 
MH: I was at the commercial marine expo in Rhode Island this year and the booth across from 
ours had-1 didn't look at it closely, but it had some kind of device around the propeller to cut 
rope that got- so that it wouldn't get tangled. 
JM: Yeah. 
MH: Are you familiar with that? 
JM: Yep, yep, they have line cutters and they'll work nice if if s one piece of rope, usually the 
lobstermen will have, a smaller lobster boat will have it. Basically two little knives that go by 
each other, when the propeller is spinning and cut the rope. And it works perfect if if s worn 
rope. If it grabs a rope, and then winds it on, if s- if s usually a mess for the diver. Because now I 
got obviously they're not spinning, but they are two big sharp blades that I'm cutting around — 
[laughs] So there's a love hate relationship with those. They're nice be cause they get the guys 
home safely, possibly you know to get- get the one rope out, but I think, I think the larger boats 
have so much horsepower and so much bigger engines that they- there's less of them. And even 
the guys that are dealing with line all the time, like the long line boats, there's not many of them 
that have the cutters on them. 
MH: Now how about gender? Have you noticed more or less women on the waterfront and have 
you ever been- has there ever been an issue that you are aware of? Are there any divers that are 
women? 
JM: Yeah there's a lady in Newport that takes care of Newport, and Providence, and I believe 
she's travelled over this way. As far as I know she's not to be messed with because she shows up 
and she means business and she gets the job done. So anybody, I think in my line of work, you 
don't have to be the big strong guy, you don't have to be macho, you don't have to be girl or boy. 
Interview with Jim Mercer, April 13, 2017 
it's just you got to, you got to know to get out of the water when you're scared or when it's not 
safe. You got to know when if s not safe. You have to be scared. As far as being a boy or a girl 
I don't think it would matter at all. That- I'm trying to think of her name, the lady that dives in 
Newport is very busy, thaf s all she does, and I know, I haven't bounced into her but I know my 
cousin owns a boatyard, my cousin's husband owns a boatyard, and he uses her, and we'll talk at 
weddings and whatnot, and he says she is, she's no B.S., she's the real deal. On the waterfront, 
there’s a, the ladies that make the bags, there's the ladies that clean, there's the ladies that shop 
and clean, which I'm friends with all of them. Rachel Erlandson, I've known forever, back in the 
eighties, we'd go skiing together, she knew about the store and her boyfriend was a, was a 
fisherman at the time, and we used to all go skiing together. So we always see each other and 
talk about our dogs, and she's awesome. There's never been, not that I know of, never been any 
problems with any of the ladies on the waterfront, 
[1:15:00] 
is there more or less? Yeah there's probably more guys to girls but there's one fisherman lady 
that I know of, fisherwoman. She's mate on three different boats and she holds her own against 
any of the guys, as far as I've been told. Cutting, that on the scallop boats you have to cut fairly 
fast so, she's a just as fast a cutter, and thafs not any you know, you don't need to be a big burly 
guy or anything like that. If s not a "man's only" business, definitely not. As long as you don't 
mind getting a little dirty sometimes. 
MH: Yeah. 
JM: Let's see. How about ethnic groups? Has that changed at all over time? That you've 
noticed? 
JM: A little bit. I've noticed. I've noticed a few of the guys that run boats that are I believe 
Guatemalan captains, what, what happens is. I've seen the boat come back, and then they kind of, 
they kind of share more. Luckily there's no Guatemalan divers, but the five or six guys that he 
went out with, will unload the boat or whatever, or if one or two don't want to, there's two right 
there to back them up, and then a whole bunch to just clean the boat. So now you know, you're 
sharing duties with fifteen guys instead of seven and getting it done. That's all the owner wants 
anyways, just to get the job done. Yeah, if s a, if s diverse down here. If s funny, I went to the 
Whaling Museum, and I was listening to the movie that they have and they said, "And New 
Bedford in this time was a very diverse community." And I'm thinking to myself, well, they're 
not here now then, because if s still diverse! [laughs] With the whaling industry it was Cape 
Verdean and well now there's Portuguese and Polish, and Norwegian, and yeah Guatemalan, and 
there's, there's several boats and that have Dominicans and guys from the Dominican Republic 
and whatnot and that are all sharing the diversity. I think it's more love of the ocean, because it 
takes a strange person to do that, yeah it's, they're sharing the love. The Whaling Museum movie 
is funny: "There were so many different places." Yeah, there still is! There’s so many different 
places that are here now, still a little melting pot. 
MH: How about language? Is there, if there are a lot of Guatemalans or other South American 
Spanish speakers, is there, do- does most everybody speak some English at least? 
Interview with Jim Mercer, April 13, 2017 
JM: No. There's some, there's only a handful of guys that don't know English. There's plenty of 
guys that know- they're all speaking English to me. And, a few of the painters that I see. I'll pop 
up out of the water and you know I'll give him a, "Buenos dias!" and they'll laugh, they think it's 
funny, they're like, "Yeah, good morning," you know? [laughter^ And, they're all good 
guys. Most, mostly English, mostly English speaking, there’s never — I have to communicate 
with a few guys just in case they're going to start engines or whatnot. The routine when I get 
down there is to check around, check six boats even though I'm only looking at one. 
MH: Oh. Yes. 
JM: Yeah. Because engines could be starting, if s just a generator, sound travels differently 
under water than it does on land, it's a twenty-five times faster and it's much louder, so that you 
know [knocks twice], a simple knock on a hull is- if s loud. It sounds like you're inside of a 
drum. 
MH: Well you mentioned danger, so that's one of the dangers, is if engines 
[1:20:00] 
start nearby? 
JM: Yeah, if they start nearby. I'll know it if they start nearby, but I'll also know if they start 
across the river also. 
MH: Because it’s loud? 
JM: They’re very big engines and they're really loud underwater. The distinct, they usually have 
a compressor that turns a giant air starter, they don't have a battery starter. So it's got this air tool 
sound to it. Even though it's a starter, [makes an increasing pitch sound\ and oh, here it comes, 
and luckily it's not the boat you're working on, just a further, further away boat. But I'm, I'm in 
touch with owners, shore engineers, they know my car, they come over and say hi to my dog, 
if s-1 feel very safe a lot of the time. And then if there ever was a close incident, that particular 
person now, is my closest friend to check on other boats, that and now he's like over, sometimes 
I show up, and I have to wait, not a big deal. Sometimes I show up and it's way too busy, it's a 
time where they're all going fishing, and I'll say okay. I'm going to go. I'm going to go 
somewhere else now, and I'm going to come back here later and I'm going to keep my eye on the 
area. Because after four, five o'clock, everything's died down, then that boat can get done. A lot 
of times it's everybody waiting, and then on the boat I'll take care of that boat, and now there's 
five guys looking out and they're "Okay, they're not- they're not going anywhere. Nope. That’s 
where everybody's ready.” They'll park where, they'll park the boat where there's boats around it 
where there's boats that aren't moving. They're not going to park in a busy place and then call 
the diver. 
MH: Right. 
JM: Yeah, everybody's super safe. There's always a conversation that goes something like 
"Okay, don't worry, nothing is starting, check this, this, and this. Don't worry, nothing is 
starting. " And it's repeated that way, you know I know nothing is starting, so if I do hear 
something it’s not that guy, it's somebody else. 
Interview with Jim Mercer, April 13, 2017 
MH: Right. 
JM: Boats just- boats going by sometimes I'll feel a little bit of a current. But no, I'm super 
cautious with that, because there's no, there's no going and fixing if you're going to get caught up 
in something like that, you’re just gone. I'm super careful with it and there's probably a fifteen 
point checklist to dive on one boat at a time. Making sure with a lot of people that stuffs not 
going to be dangerous for me. 
MH: So what are, for somebody starting out, what would you tell them, or what kinds of things- 
JM: Not to do it! [laughter] If s funny- my son, has helped me in the past, and he was, he's on 
vacation a similar time that I am, and I've told him a couple of years ago, “You're not 
diving.” He would take care of my boats if I was gone. And, I'd say. Okay. I'm far away, 
which I'm a nervous Nellie to begin with, and I'll call and this and this and this, and okay- he's 
going to dive, "Yeah everything's okay, yeah everything's okay." And then they're just like, ah, 
your dad's nervous, so I'm like, listen, call me right when you get out, call me right before you go 
in, call me right when you get out." 
MH: [laughing] 
JM: One time his friend called me, he's like "He's almost out of the water." I'm like "I don't 
want to know almost out of the water, I want to know when he's out of the water." It's, you get- 
you can't rush into things. I would tell the person getting into it, you can't rush into things. Go 
and hang out at- go and work at the shipyard, go and know what the bottom of the boat is. Have 
an interest in diving. Don't be scared of cold, dark places. Know your mind. There's books that 
people read, that people write about this kind of stuff but there's, there's certain comfort zones, 
and my comfort zone might be way more than 
[1:25:00] 
other people's because I am diving under a boat thaf s the engine's running, but not for one 
second am I like, all right this isn't dangerous. I-1 always know that it's dangerous, that what I'm 
doing is dangerous. That there's not too many other people that would do it. If s not that there's 
too many other people that will do it and stay with it, there's not too many other people that'll do 
it and stay comfortable. Because they're just, if s- ifs a little bit spooky, and if you're not scared 
there's something wrong with you. That's why I've always you know, always related to. So 
anybody getting into it, just know your stuff, go super slow. Ifs so easy to miss a cooler, if ifs 
not good visibility, or a scratch in the hull that you know they didn't know about, sometimes the 
captains switch boats and the owner will just call me and go, "Okay, before the new captain goes 
on there, I want to know if anything was left from the last captain." Because the new captain 
will find it. 
MH: Right. 
JM: Whatever it might be. So, you know. And I'll just check it, before the new captain goes on 
that particular boat, and the owner's got the thumb's up, and they- they go from there. Yeah it's 
a- know the boats, know the- be comfortable with the water, and then there's a whole gamut of 
funny personalities that you have to- [laughs] that you have to- I'm sure you've interviewed 
Interview with Jim Mercer, April 13, 2017 
enough of us! We're all pretty quirky! And there's a whole gamut of personalities that you got 
to, you got to play. I don't say play, I'm myself, and I'm a likable guy. I think my dad instilled 
that in me working in the store and talking to people. It always came easy to me to start up a 
conversation, and just grab some cough drops later cause your throat hurts from talking too 
much! \laughter~\ 
MH: So what is the- probably the most dangerous aspect of your job? 
JM: The most dangerous. Every day is pretty dangerous. Every day. It's not- it's not easy, I say 
this lightheartedly, but if s- they say, “Go and check the propeller,” and I'm not staying five feet 
away I'm not staying ten feet away. I'm not staying' two feet away. I'm basically making love to a 
propeller. I'm wrapping myself around it. I'm looking at it in every little aspect possible: there's 
four blades, and five blades, and three blades, and looking at the blade edges, and if if s- if 
somebody turned an engine on, if s like a- if s a blender. If s not, you know, if s a- [laughs] every 
day is dangerous, and I don't take it light hearted. I'm like, that's my — Before, when I get the 
call- it's such and such a boat. I'm already reviewing in my head what the last time I was there, 
was there a bad thing that happened, was there maybe a bad thing? Is it, is it on a scale of one to 
ten being dangerous where I think, they're all seven to ten. Well this one, that one was a nine 
and a half, so. We'll be on guard when we head to that boat. And then you get down there and 
if s a new scenario. If s, rechecking and checking of the equipment, there's rechecking and 
checking with the owners and shore engineers. And nobody wants to be the guy that turns the 
engine on when the diver's down there so. Yeah, every time it’s pretty dangerous. There's not, 
in no way is it an easy job. And nor is fishing. Thafs like a question to ask the captain. Like, 
“Oh is it nicer going?” Yeah if s nicer going in nice weather but boats don't always go down in a 
storm. They can get caught up and they can- you know there' so many different scenarios. The 
captain knows that. That's probably why we're all quirky like we are [laughs], but there's no 
easy part. There's no easy part. The easy part of the job is when you're out and in the car, and 
you're 
[1:30:00] 
watching them drive away, going to get some fish. If s satisfying, it's, okay, if s done, nobody's 
hurt, nobody's going to get hurt, nothing else can- everything, they're not going to spend another 
nine thousand dollars on fuel, because that what it will be. If s oh, we spent three thousand more 
gallons, if s not a dollar a gallon anymore. 
MH: Yeah. 
JM: If s two dollars and three dollars a gallon- [laughing] we just spent nine thousand dollars 
more on fuel because he had barnacles or they were dragging a rope around the whole time. 
MH: Yeah. So you have a son, and did you mention a daughter? 
JM: No, just a son. 
MH: Okay, just a son. Okay. And what does he do? 
JM: He's in a unique job. He actually builds mountain bike trails for a Canadian company, that- 
Gravity Logic, they go all over the world and build trails. Usually downhill trails, but 
Interview with Jim Mercer, April 13, 2017 
sometimes, just a trail like any trail in the woods. They go through with excavators and GPS 
mapping and then they ride them obviously, because he's a daredevil like me and loves to, loves 
to ride. Very- it's incredible actually for the first time I got to go to one of the places that they, 
that they redid, rebuilt all the trails, if s in Massachusetts, if s called Thunder Mountain, and you 
go up the mountain on a chair lift and then ride down, and it sounds spooky at first, but there's 
much like skiing, there's green, and blues, and blacks and yeah I stayed away from the blacks. I 
watched him go down one of the blacks, I couldn’t even stand on the earth there. But a beginner 
trail with a big new mountain bike and you're on your own rollercoaster with brakes. So if you're 
spooked you're- you grab the brakes. But it was a- if s really neat to see him getting older and 
having a great job. He's off in the winter, so he goes on vacations with me now. He doesn't help 
out with the diving because that's too nerve wracking for me. [laughter^ 
MH: So you think that the diving is more dangerous than the biking? 
JM: {Laughter^ I don’t know! It’s splitting hairs! And thaf s just being a worried dad, he’d say 
no way. But I'd say no way the other way because I'm no way as good on a bike as he is. Yeah, 
they're splitting hairs. 
MH: So are there any industry associations for divers? 
JM: Probably not. I think with the bigger stuff, and I say bigger, I mean more like deeper, right 
away people say "Oil rigs!" Oil rigs or bridge building stuff, bridge inspection stuff, there's 
definitely a lot of organizations. You know a lot of times, when you're dealing with that stuff, 
union. So much like a contractor would go on to the next bridge there wouldn't be a you know a 
diver's association that would, that would help those guys out in any, way, shape, or form. A 
bridge contractor can't be held back by "Oh the diver can't make it today," or "He's too tired." So 
they get another guy right on the scene that knows what he's doing and moves, moves forward 
with the job. 
MH: Did that ever interest you, doing any other kind of diving on bridges or rigs? 
JM: No, I- probably not. If s safe for people to go over bridges that are looked at by the 
divers. That's kind of neat, it's a- never got into it, it was probably a travelling thing, that I 
couldn't at the time go after. As far as deeper stuff, I don't have any interest in-1 have dove deep 
before but I think repetitive is going to beat you up 
[1:35:00] 
a little bit on your muscles and not be, not be as safe. 
MH: Right. 
JM: It's a whole different other bunch of circumstances that come into play when you're diving 
deeper. 
MH: So. I think I've asked you about everything that I had planned to ask you, but is there 
anything that you can think of that I haven't asked you that I should have? Since I'm fairly 
ignorant about diving? 
Interview with Jim Mercer, April 13, 2017 
JM: No, we went over the whole gamut. It's dangerous, it's fulfilling, if s a great job. If s a- if s 
nice to be part of a community, I josh around with some of the guys and become really good 
friends with a decent amount of guys that, that can help you out with things that you don't 
normally do. "Hey, I need a cutting torch!" And the guy just says, "Take that one off of that 
boat! That boat’s not going anywhere! Take the whole thing!" And I'm scratching my head and 
I'm like, oh my God, am I, did I get in over my head? But he's just letting me take it so I'll live 
and learn with it and you know the group of guys that are there to help you out with something or 
teach you something or just to pick your brain or laugh about something for an hour in the 
morning before you dive. Honest to goodness genuine people. "Hey how was your 
vacation? How's your son doing with that stuff?” And you know reciprocal questions and I've 
been working with these guys for I don't know fifteen years now and I just discovered that one of 
them's his son. And I, I said to him I was like, "I didn't know, you guys didn't tell 
me." \laughter~\ They looked at me kind of funny there, they're all: "You couldn't tell?" And 
I'm like, "No I couldn't tell!" I'm like, you can tell, but my son looks identical to me and I'm like, 
he can tell he's my son! And if you drive around with him, like, oh, that’s that guy’s son. And 
I'm like, "I feel like I'm the only one that didn't know that that was your son, you know?” And 
just a big group of guys that you know you become friends with that you're you know you're 
helping out, you know you're making them more comfortable, and yeah, if s a job. It's just a 
normal job. Way different than retail! 
\laughter~\ 
MH: So- if you were going to design a little exhibit, what do you think is the most important 
thing that you'd like to- people who know nothing about fishing or nothing about the waterfront, 
what should they know? 
JM: As far as the diving goes? 
MH: Mm hmm! 
JM: Maybe like uh, before and after picture of the barnacles. And — 
MH: Thaf s a good idea! 
JM: I have some like-1 have some huge barnacles. I wish I could copy and just cover a 
propeller with them, and then have a before and after, like this is after the diver came through. I 
have a giant amount. Lot of times, if I run over, if the boat runs over the rope, and then I have to 
take it out, whether it be rope or monofilament from the long liners or whatever it- the boat 
comes home the whole way and it will bum or melt and become these big plastic crazy pieces, 
and I have a couple of crazy plastic pieces that are just like- they're absurd to look at but people 
will go, "What is that?" you know, and ifs, yeah. Ifs a clump of rope that almost stopped the 
propeller, almost stopped the trip. Yeah that would be a neat exhibit. A lot of photos, if not of 
the real thing, people love treasure. I've always found some of the funniest things on the bottom 
of New Bedford harbor. I dropped a super nice light. It's still down there probably, but-1 had a 
quick dive job to do on a Saturday morning and my girlfriend was with me and I said "The water 
was super clear. After I do this job. I'm going to go try to find that light." So I got down to the 
bottom, I can't find the light. I'm like, kicking around here and there, I came up with this 
hatch. Ifs half the size of this window and I don't know what it would be to, ifs all bronze and 
Interview with Jim Mercer, April 13, 2017 
beautiful like not shined up but it's this big green bronze hatch. And still every part of it still 
works, ifs just the 
[1:40:00] 
glass isn't there. And I'm like, what was this even, what could it be to? It was just so big and I 
brought that up and my girl said "What are you doing?" I could barely pull it up, it weighs like a 
hundred pounds and yeah. Ifs always fun. Exhibit of barnacles and rope and probably the 
gear. The gear is a lot more- like an older suit or something like that. With a, with a 
dummy. I'm — my retail is kicking in! ITl come up with the whole thing. Some old flashlights 
and old gloves that get worn out, that's always cool stuff And people you know, they see the 
fishermen in nice new outfits, they don't see them in the old stuff Because that just gets 
tossed. Yeah. Thafd be fun. 
MH: Well, ifs been great talking to you. I think, I feel like I've learned a lot. 
JM: I do every day. Every day I'm down at the waterfront. I'm like, holy mackerel! That cable 
needs- that cable thaf s on that drum needs replacing, like every two trips! And that cable on one 
drum is thirty thousand dollars! 
MH: Yikes. 
JM: And you go, oh, ifs just a big rusty fishing boat. Oh, thaf s thirty thousand! Some people 
don't make that in a year. You know? 
MH: Yeah. 
JM: I learned that like two or three years ago, I use that for an example. People go, 
"Really? The cable?" And ifs, ifs holding a big metal dredge thafs twenty thousand dollars 
worth of bending, and welding, and design- and research. You know, if you got a bad cable that 
you put that overboard with you're kind of silly cause you're going to throw out twenty thousand 
dollars. Yeah, ifs a-ifs very complicated. Ifs more complicated than what people think. The 
guys that know it- they, they might not get home and fix their water heater or whatever. Yeah 
they probably could fix their water heater. But they just hire a guy to do so because what they've 
wrapped their minds around is- ifs huge. Ifs huge. It's a- going out to a dangerous place, to get 
the seafood back to New Bedford. Ifs pretty intense. 
MH: Yeah. Yeah. And have you noticed that there are fewer. I'm sure you'd notice fewer 
draggers around now? 
JM: Yeah, there's less draggers than the heyday of dragging. Definitely. I think-1 think there's 
safer boats, now that are dragging. Because there are fewer of them, they are easier to keep track 
of and take care of With all the requirements and the restrictions that they have, I think it's not, 
ifs not like ifs a dying breed but it needed to be minimized, to a certain amount. That way we're 
not running out of fish completely because then what is all this thirty thousand dollars worth of 
wire good for nothing. It's funny, I want to see in the future a whole boat that's- that people can 
go on, and can go out for, let’s say a couple hours and say, "Yep, this is, can you imagine doing 
this now for seven days? Yeah I don't think people can wrap their heads around that. You know. 
Interview with Jim Mercer, April 13, 2017 
set the timer for every eight hours. All right, you're going to work for eight hours and then sleep 
for one. Try doing that on land. 
MH: Yeah. 
JM: Let alone on a boat, if s difficult. We should be all be paying more for fish, [laughs] 
MH: Yeah. 
JM: And scallops! Ifs pretty intense. 
MH: Do you see a decent future for the industry? 
JM: Yeah, I don't think they want to- nobody wants to get rid of, get rid of all the fish, and be 
done with the industry. That would, that would just be silly. And, there's a lot of owners 
[1:45:00] 
that are educated, there’s a lot of owners that, that know their business, and, they're constantly 
looking at the numbers so I'm sure they don't want, you know you can have a bad year but then 
there's a good year thaf s coming up. I think, I think I have a future in it. As far as the smaller 
guys, stuff that I used to do, that's kind of getting cut back so. I'm not sure if that's going to open 
back up or come back around, but in years past I could spearfish for tautog, right through the 
year. 
MH: So when you were commercial fishing thaf s what you were doing? 
JM: Yeah, I would spear fish tautog. I've done some monkfishing on a gillnetter, out of 
Westport, I've done- I've lobstered for a little while. 
MH: [laughs] Why? 
JM: I commercial quohauged for years. But I would always say, commercial quohogging you 
go out, and you got your baskets and you got your rake, or you got your dive gear, and you, you 
come home with that. You know and all that stuff is safe even though- you know, it was 
commercial quohogging and an orange basket it costs like thirty dollars and it doesn't seem like a 
lot of money right now but that thirty dollar orange basket was important. You wrote your name 
on it and you kept- you put strings on it to make sure nobody else would take that silly orange 
basket and I see some of the scallopers have like fifty of them on deck and I'm always get 
reminded, yeah thaf s a scalloper versus a quohogger. When you go lobstering, you got all this 
beautiful gear, you got a hundred dollar lobster pot and twenty dollars worth of line on it, and a 
forty dollar buoy, and then you paint it up, you make it all nice and then you put it out in the 
ocean! [laughter] And hope that lobsters go into it! Ifs just, ifs- and there's guys that kill 
it. They do so well with it, and hands down to them. But I didn't like lobstering because all your 
beautiful stuff would go out in the ocean, stay there and then a storm would come and it just 
throws everything up on the beach, and then people are driving away with it, on the beach, and 
you're like "Well, thafs mine!" [laughter] "No ifs not, I found it on the beach!" Yeah, it was- 
it’s hard. Lobstering was really tough. So yeah, I lobstered for a little while, the commerical 
fishing I did was tautog, commerical bass fishing, rod and reel. Just out of a small boat for 
myself That stuff is all getting nipped. And yeah, I know several observers and they were

saying "We're going out tautog fishing." I was like, well, what are you going out tautog fishing 
out now for? Now you're going to say Well there's no tautog. Well they're not here yet. Well 
nobody's going tautog fishing yet. You can't go until you see the dandelions. Did you see any 
dandelions? Why dandelions? Well, there's little quirky things- like when I see a lot of jellyfish, 
the water's getting warmer, then I see dandelions, and then I see the tautog. And I just saw two 
jellyfish. So one dandelion, the tautog ain't here. Maybe one or two are somewhere out there, 
but you're not going to go- when you see a whole bunch, that's when you see a whole bunch of 
fish. So yeah, I was laughing with them. I said, yeah, you got to wait till there's more 
dandelions. They're shaking their heads, [laughter^ Some of the old timers know about the, the 
blueberry trees. The buds on the blueberry tree whether it's going to be a good year for fishing 
or not. I haven't got all those down yet. [laughter^ I don't want to misquote anybody. 
MH: Well, I've always thought that there's been a lot of local knowledge that is missed unless 
you're in the industry. 
JM: Right, right. And I think it's pretty positive that it's everywhere. It's a- as you go down the 
coast, there’s, because the fish show up, I know in New Jersey the fisherman go, now that there's 
an internet and people go back and forth with fish stories, you get that, here's a fishing guy on 
Instagram and he's got pictures of dandelions. "What the hell he's got pictures of dandelions 
for? He's a fisherman." Well if s because the fish are coming. Thaf s a tell tale. If s a funny little 
tell tale. Pretty flowers or yellow weeds in the yard mean fish are coming. 
[1:50:00] 
[laughs] But yeah, it's, I think there's a lot of little quirky things that are up and down the coast 
that somebody should put in a book somewhere because there's a lot of that stuff Neat. 
MH: Yeah. Thaf s great. Well, Jim, thank you so much, this has been fascinating. 
JM: Alright. 
MH: I appreciate the time. 
JM: No problem. 
MH: And you need to, you need to go down and see the exhibit! 
JM: Oh yeah!
