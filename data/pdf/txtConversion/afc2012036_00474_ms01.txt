Fletcher Powell interviewing Sandra Reddish, May 14th, 2013, at the conference 
room at KMUW. 
 
Let me just have you start by saying your name and tell me what you do now. 
 
My name is Sandra Reddish and currently I am the 1st Infantry Division Collections 
Manager up at the Fort Riley Museums. Up by Junction City, Manhattan area. 
 
OK. And you’re also involved in the project that we are here doing right now. 
 
Correct. I was assigned as the Project Scholar. 
 
How did that come about for you? 
 
It was an email—caught me by surprise. They knew—I used to be on the speakers 
bureau, my specialty is really World War I history and I’d given a lot of talks. They 
also know—the current folks at the Humanities Council realized, or knew that I 
worked at Boeing. And I did some projects off and on when I lived down here and so, 
I don’t know, somebody just kinda remembered that and—or it may have been Jay 
Price also said, ‘hey, you need to contact her.’ 
 
Where are you from originally? 
 
Our family farm is just right outside of Lincoln, Nebraska. 
 
OK. And, so, growing up—you grew up in Lincoln? 
 
Basically, yeah. 
 
And how long were you there, then? 
 
I was in Lincoln until I left for the Marine Corps right out of high school. 
 
Right out of high school you went to the Marine Corps—and then you were in the 
Marine Corps for… a few years? 
 
Four years. And then I came back. Um… no, I didn’t, I did it differently. I got out, I 
was in legal services and I took a job up in West Virginia and did that for about two 
and a half years. Decided to come back, I couldn’t get a job, I wanted to do something 
completely different— 
 
Come back, you mean to Nebraska? 
 
Yeah, come back to Lincoln. Uh, wanted to go into a completely different field. Um, 
not legal, I was tired of working in law firms, and, uh, I couldn’t get a job. So, 
everybody’s asking, ‘do you have a college education?’ And no, but I had this… no, 
they weren’t interested. So, it forced me to go back to school. So I got my associate’s 
at a well known community college-slash-votech in manufacturing engineering. And 
then, it was on a quarter system, six quarters. Fifth quarter, Boeing representative 
came up and interviewed and they went and interviewed all the students. And I was 
a bit jaded, like, ‘yeah, whatever, I’m just gonna continue going on with my life.’ And 
I already had a job and everything, but they tracked me down— 
 
You had a job— 
 
Uh, as a supervisor, at a windows manufacturing plant in Lincoln. And they found 
me, and made me an offer, so I came to Wichita, took a look around, and accepted 
their offer. And that’s what brought me to Wichita in ’91. 
 
OK, that was 1991. Boeing, coming up there, was that something they would generally 
do, say, every year or so? 
 
No. It was new. 
 
And, so, what did you get hired to do at first? 
 
I stayed in that position as a project planner. It was manufacturing engineering 
project planner, and that’s what I did the whole time. 
 
The entire time. How long were you there? 
 
12 years. 
 
12 years. So, until ’03 or so? 
 
Yeah.  
 
OK. So, what does that mean, project planner? 
 
Still trying to figure that out. It was a weird title, because it’s not like you grow up 
and go, ‘I’m gonna be an ME project planner!’ It’s just like, what is this job? Um, I was 
really expecting more to be troubleshooting out on the line. The schooling I had was, 
basically, you got tool and die education, electrical, mechanical drawings, looking at 
manufacturing processes—through anything, not just aircraft. It’s any type of metal 
fabrication. Like I said, basically troubleshooting. And it was not at all what I 
expected when I came to Boeing. They were completely different. 
 
So what happened? 
 
Well, uh, the person that recruited me, I worked on the nacelles, which is the engine 
pod, which is certainly com—I was told—very complex, because there’s no straight 
pieces, everything’s curved and everything. You didn’t—it was an open office with 
desks. It was a small facility but it was open, desks, and you sometimes… I like 
dealing with the shop people, but not everybody did, and it was—I was told, ‘don’t 
feel bad, it’s gonna take you at least five years before you really start feeling a little 
comfortable with what you’re doing.’ And that’s true, it really is true. 
 
Was that because of the work environment? Or the kind of work? 
 
5:03 
 
The kind of work. It is just so—you know, people go, ‘what did you do?’ In my family. 
And I would go, ‘uhhhh… you see this really complex piece? That’s the final product. 
Well, I could be working on certain subassemblies and how that all fits together, and 
new pieces coming in, I mean, it’s just, it was very strange. 
 
Was it sort of analysis on those pieces? 
 
No, I even came in with my machine handbook with all the formulas, they’re like, 
‘oh, forget it, you don’t need it.’ I’m like, ‘I don’t?’ And they’re like, ‘no, we don’t do 
that.’ So it’s basically, it’s tracking parts, little minute parts, detailed parts, and 
ordering those parts to make these subassemblies, which then make the final 
assembly. But then you have revisions coming in and engineering changes, and then 
you’ve got to sign off on these changes… That’s only one aspect, you could also be a 
part of the tooling area. So it was very different. Um, I had CAD experience when I 
was getting my education, nobody really worked on CAD— 
 
CAD? 
 
Oh, computer-aided drafting. 
 
So, you had computer-aided drafting experience, but you got there and nobody was 
doing that. 
 
Not really. 
 
In this big company. 
 
Yeah, that was a big surprise, because even the engineers, everybody was still on the 
boards with their drafting machines. It was tripping me out. 
 
Was that something that you were able—could you go back and do something that 
was at, um, I guess sort of the analog level? After you’d been working with the 
computer stuff? 
 
Yeah, they, they—later on, they started pushing everybody… Boeing had their own 
systems, the CATIA, which is definitely much more complex than the simple CAD I 
was trained on, and so everybody was—but, you know, if you don’t use it, you lose 
it. And so they did all this push, trained people, and then some folks actually got a 
chance to work on it, not everybody. Large portion did it. Certainly if you were a 
drafter or engineer you were using it all the time, you had your sys—machine at 
your desk. But, uh, it was a very strange job. Even now, I have a hard time trying to 
describe it to people. But, yeah, you don’t just go into you education going—or you 
think, ‘this is what I want to do when I grow up.’ It’s just really kind of bizarre. 
 
So, it took—you did basically that for the 12 years you were there— 
 
Mmm-hmm, I worked on different programs, but yeah. And as you did it you became 
more comfortable with it. 
 
Did you have to go through new training each time you either switched programs or 
maybe started— 
 
No, not really. They really kind of picked—I don’t know, I managed to work different 
programs, which I liked. You got a really good idea of how they manufactured 
planes, or fab parts and assembled planes, because I worked AOG—airplane on the 
ground—for a very short time, and looking at… some countries are still using 727s, 
and looking at those drawings and trying to piece out how they put—what was 
wrong, how do they put these assemblies together, to compare to current drawings, 
it was amazing. But it—I tell some people, some of the old planners, at their desk, 
they would bring out this big bottle of aspirin, they’re like, ‘that’s what you’re going 
to be having to use.’ 
 
Really? 
 
Oh yeah, most of the planners I knew, in their desk they had big bottles of aspirin. 
 
Just because it was going to give you a headache? 
 
Oh yeah. Yeah. Some days you’d be so intense and so focused on what you’re doing, 
there were some days I couldn’t even go home and read at night. 
 
Oh my goodness. 
 
Eye fatigue. Yeah, it could be—I mean, if you’re really working your, whatever the 
situation that day, it could, yeah, you have to really be focused. Because you’re 
dealing with a lot of parts, a lot of assemblies, a lot of things going in, you’re having 
lots of different revisions, drawings, parts, and it can get incredibly complex.  
 
You said you were sort of in an open office. How many people were working around 
you, about? 
 
At least 12. At least 12 to maybe 15. But that was a small office, that’s not—I was on 
the small part of the plane. Those people that worked the body section, much larger. 
 
How large do you figure their sections were? 
 
At least doubled. If not more. 
 
OK. And were you basically working on that small part for those 12 years? 
 
10:00 
 
No, I worked nacelles, and then they—then the new program, I did AOG for a little 
bit, um, the 3-7 kicked off, the new gen, so people were trying to get on that, so that’s 
when I really went to the body sections. And then you had 41, Jennifer (Marshall) 
mentioned that, the nose part, and then, you know, it increased, and then—I forgot 
which layoff time, they were really cutting and they were trying to save people. So I 
went across the street, across Oliver, and I went over to the modification side. And 
they were doing, I think, 757 mods, making them into cargos. So we did—there were 
some of us interlopers that went over there. And basically our jobs were saved. I’m 
not gonna say ‘hid,’ but we managed to keep our jobs. And when things started to 
come up more on the commercial side we just went back over. 
 
I know that in engineering, especially, there are—more now, but there historically 
have not been a lot of women. When you got there, was that the case for you? Were 
there other women around? 
 
Oh yeah, and that surprised me. I’m a—I don’t know if I jumped the gun on your 
questions or not, but when I was hired, and they hired four other of my classmates, 
and they hired a couple other folks from colleges, and one thing I noticed—I was old, 
I was a non-trad college student, and they—it seemed like there was this push to get 
college-degreed people in. Most of the folks I worked around were at least 15 years 
older than I was, and, I believe, did not have college degrees. 
 
At Boeing. 
 
Yes. At least in the planning section. My understanding—you know, hearsay from 
some of the employees—some… there was a woman, she wanted a job at Boeing and 
so you just kept showing up at the HR office every day, and they basically started 
recognizing you, and then when they found, you know, when they came, an opening 
or something, then they would hire you and then they would train you, so I think a 
lot of that was literally on-the-job training. But I think there was this push in the 
early ‘90s when I came on board—maybe a little earlier, I’m not sure—to start 
getting college-degreed people and younger people in. Because at that time it was, 
you would consider it an older workforce. 
 
And so— 
 
But, yes, there were women, which surprised me. There were still some pangs of—I 
would go out, and there were women in the shop, of course. There was a few 
supervisors, not many, first line supervisors out in the shop. Some of the comments 
you’d hear, like, ‘well you know, when you go out to the shop they’re gonna stand 
around, they’re gonna make comments,’ and I’m like, ‘so?’ I mean, I came out of the 
Marines, so what do you—some shop guy’s comment’s not gonna get me riled up. 
But that was their… some of the women’s coaching or advice. So there was some of 
that still going on. 
 
Did you find that any of that actually happened? Whether it affected you or not? 
 
No, I didn’t. But then again I like the shop—um, there was always this animosity 
between, it seemed like, shop and engineering and office folks. And I think some of it 
was justifiable. ‘Well, you’re telling us what to do but you never come out of the 
office, you never see what’s really going on,’ and the line was ‘planners just screwed 
up,’ you’d hear that a lot. So I’d try to work them, like, ‘ok, now what’s the problem?’ 
 
So you actually made an effort to— 
 
Yeah, I mean, I thought it was stupid. And I’d call it—I did not care for planners who 
planned off their ass. Which means they, it was just like pulling teeth to go out there 
and check on problems. To me, they were just as bad as those folks saying, 
‘engineering screwed up, tooling screwed up.’ ‘Well did you go talk to them?’ Same 
thing. On the office side. 
 
Yeah, it makes it a lot easier if you’re going and talking to the people. 
 
Yeah. 
 
You mentioned that you were at least able to sort of save your job by moving across 
the street, at least at one point. Did you personally—did you have to deal with layoffs 
yourself at all? 
 
Mmm-hmm. Part of my first layoff notice—see, that whole feast and famine things 
was weird for me, and I’m still not used to it. 
 
Just the culture, the idea that some times are going to be great and some are not going 
to be and that’s just the way it is. 
 
Yeah, the first—I was hired in ’91, the first layoff round came in ’93. And you really 
started seeing people getting—it was, you know, ‘you’re brand new, you should go 
out,’ but then, you know, there’s just so many dynamics working at it. I wasn’t sure 
how to take it, but I also heard, too, from folks who lived through it, ‘oh, usually the 
layoffs are really short, a lot of guys save up the time and they use it as a mini-
vacation,’ and, ‘oh, it’ll blow over in a couple weeks,’ and crossing the picket line, 
meaning, you know, just for us non-union folks, it still made it difficult to go into 
work. And, yeah, I wasn’t used to that, and still, that mentality still never got used to. 
 
So were you personally laid off? 
 
15:49 
 
No, you know, I’ve never personally been laid off, but the one—the last, I think, go-
around, or the really long layoff, I can’t remember which year that was. I’m sure if 
you talk to some shop people over—it was long. Longer. Most of them anticipated. I 
got three notices. They take you right up to the wire and say, ‘oh, you’ve been saved!’ 
And then they give you the next 60 day notice, and then they—you know, you think, 
‘that’s great,’ you get a reprieve, but it can wear on you. 
 
Yeah, well, that must be really nerve-wracking. 
 
Yeah. 
 
Were people around you being laid off? Directly around you? Or were all of you getting 
that reprieve? 
 
No, there were people that were getting laid off. 
 
Yeah. Could you see it wearing on people? The people being laid off and then brought 
back? 
 
Yes, I mean, some of them, I’m not going to call them old-timers because they 
weren’t that old, but they’d been around with the company for, like, for a good 15, 
20 years, um… yeah, you could see it. We had some folks that made that transition, 
that worked in the shop, did the training and came in as a planner, while they were 
new, some had a hard time adjusting to it. And then the downturn came, layoffs, and 
yeah, they would get hit.  
 
And then some might come back, some might not. 
 
Mmm-hmm. 
 
You mentioned also having to cross the picket line, um, and so, you had no affiliation 
with a union yourself? 
 
No. At that time, like, tooling, planners, not union—yeah, it was, yeah, I’d never 
experienced it, I mean, all the little tactics of doing the slow walking across, like 
this— 
 
Like, you were walking— 
 
No, no, like if you’re driving to get into the parking lot and they’re doing the— 
 
Oh, they’re walking, the strikers— 
 
Going slow, and then this person starts. And then of course, the whole monitoring 
and watching what kind of comments are being said. You know, there was one 
incident, I think it was a contractor just got a little peeved and zipped through… 
yeah.  
 
Did you feel like there was animosity toward you for having to cross that line? 
 
No, no I didn’t, because, one, I wasn’t at the plant—this is when things were really 
hopping for Boeing, they had those offices clear at the end by the QT just south of 
the plant. I mean, at the very southern end there’s these offices now, Boeing had 
those. And I was working there. So, no, I didn’t. It was just, it was a game. The union 
guys knew it was a game. Office people knew it was a game. You just had to deal 
with it. 
 
And how did you—did you basically feel that way about the people doing it, it was a 
thing they had do to? Did you have any particular personal attitude toward the people 
who had to—who were striking? 
 
No, you know, I go back and forth on that. I mean, I understood, from logic—you 
know, understanding, you know, even just give an inch and the company will take, 
and, not to lose anything. But then, sometimes you go, ‘god, you know, I know what 
these people make, and they make a lot more than I do, what are they crabbing 
about?’ But, you know, I understood, I really did. But, most of the time, you know, all 
the times I remembered they pretty much behaved themselves. You just, you just 
learn to deal with it, try not to—usually, like the first week or so, but, as it wore on, 
everybody was getting really tired, and you just didn’t see the goofiness that went 
on at the first part. 
 
Do you remember how many times that might have happened while you were there? 
 
It was just that one time, it was a really long—I’d have to go through my notes and 
see which… I think we were, yeah, we were working on the 737 new gen. I believe, 
yeah, and, yeah, they were under the gun, the company was, to get this things out, 
and, yeah, they were on manpower and then the talks come up. 
 
Right, in the middle of all of that. So you were obviously there during the merger with 
McDonnell Douglas. What was that like for you and the area you were working in? Did 
you see any real effects from that? 
 
20:34 
 
I don’t think so much effects in the area, but you could see… the animosity was 
Stonecipher.  
 
From the workers toward him? 
 
Yeah, and how, I think workers felt, how they thought of Boeing. And one thing, you 
know, they always had the TV going and, you know, ‘how many orders,’ and aviation 
news. And I knew—and McDonnell Douglas wasn’t doing that well in their plant, at 
it was like, ‘well, why is Boeing mergering?’ Because their commercial side, as far as 
I understood it, was really dying off. Well, they brought it in for the space. But, yeah, 
having, that one guy said, yeah, having Phil Condit there, but then having Harry 
Stonecipher there, and there was just—you could tell, he brought in a business 
atmosphere, he was, we would call a pretty cold business guy. Yeah, and so that 
didn’t—and then you had Mr. Sweater, Phil Condit, out there, you know, like what a 
difference.  
 
Yeah, just some real dissonance there between the two? 
 
Yeah, I mean, you see them together, but you could just tell when you’d see them, 
and yeah, there’s just that whole, that starting to shift. Like other people have said, 
you know, quote, that family feeling, and then now, it was like a wake-up call. 
 
So, you felt that shift? 
 
Oh yeah. But, you know, I think, at that time I was getting my bachelor’s degree in 
quality management, but also I was reading up on news, you know, keeping 
apprised of business, and it was the culture of business. And, you know, with the 
mergers going on, going back to the stakeholders, yeah, it was no longer ‘just keep 
padding away,’ it’s gotta—you gotta be lean, the big competition was Airbus, all you 
had to do was watch the orders. I mean, so if you looked it from that standpoint, you 
could understand. But if you’re used to this ‘being taken care of’ and you’re all, we’re 
all, you know, one happy family, it was a shock. Especially for the folks that had been 
around for a long time.  
 
So you were there for four or five years after the merger, and in those four or five years 
did you continue to feel a shift toward the focus on the business? 
 
Yeah, I think they did, the mindset certainly turned more business-wise. In fact, 
when I left in 2003, there was another layoff heading up, and so it was a chance for 
me to try and go do something different. So I took it. But it was already—there was 
another decline and started doing layoffs. But yeah, I think it—by then people were 
pretty much, um, the whole business thing… they brought in the shareholders thing 
where all employees got part of the business, so that was new, so the share prices go 
up, you got a small dividend or however much, they were giving out stock options to 
employees for—as a reward, or a thank-you, that type. So that I saw very much 
different from when I came on board. So yeah, yeah, more business-minded. 
Much more corporate. 
 
Yeah. Yeah. 
 
So there were more layoffs coming and you decided you were finished at Boeing? Was 
it because you felt like you might get laid off, or it’s just, ‘this feels like a good 
transition point’? 
 
It was time for me to leave, I probably should have left a few years earlier. Because I 
wasn’t moving. I was—initially, there was a gentleman who really tried to 
incorporate a lot of the new management techniques… like I said, they were moving 
to Just-in-time—that whole ‘90s, I see, like we were talking about Deming, and there 
was Crosby, there was another guru of quality—and they were trying to implement 
these different programs and to work smarter and better, more efficient. And so, 
they were really pushing, I think, to get a new breed of managers. And so, I had a 
gentleman that was my sponsor, you know, would try to do the mentorship and stuff 
like that. That worked for a while, and then basically when they had problems with 
the triple-seven, um, falling behind schedule, and they just kept throwing manpower 
and overtime to try to resolve it, you could see them going back to the old, old ways. 
 
So they were trying out these, these new, uh, management techniques, but then— 
 
25:20 
 
When they hit some really—glitches, I believe, or I saw… and by that time I was back 
in Plant 2 working, and, yeah, it was constant overtime. People working ungodly 
hours and they were just, they were under the gun, and I think they resorted back to 
what they knew. The, you know, ‘work harder work harder,’ that type of mentality. 
 
Instead of pushing through with this new idea. 
 
Instead of sticking with it, yeah, and working in teams and, et cetera, that—basically 
he ended up retiring. The whole thing, if you lose your sponsor you lose your 
sponsor. And so then I went back. 
 
And so do you feel like the whole company, they reverted back because of that and then 
they just never got back to trying those new management techniques again? 
 
I think they tried them, I think some were in place. You know, I can’t really answer 
that, I just—hearsay, I mean, I still get my taxes done here and so a guy that works 
down there, I always go, ‘ok, what’s the poop, what’s going on down there?’ And you 
know, some of the things he told me last time, you know, they resorted back to the 
old ways of doing things. So… even though they’re now Spirit, but it’s basically the 
same crews who used to be wearing the Boeing hat. 
 
Where did you go after you finished at Boeing? 
 
I went up to Kansas State, I was in the PhD program and I was trying to do the—I got 
my bachelor’s and master’s here— 
 
At Wichita? 
 
Yeah—bachelor’s at Newman College and then got my master’s at Wichita State. I 
mean, that was one thing—that was another thing the company, I don’t know, I don’t 
think anybody mentioned that… About the mid-90s, or early 90s, they were pushing 
for employees to get their college education. And at that time there was the 
stipulation—engineering, business, or quality, and that’s what they would pay your 
degree. So I got my quality management degree. 
 
And they paid the entire thing? 
 
Yes. I mean, you had to make, like, bachelor’s “C” or higher, and they would pay that 
and your books, but, you know, of course you had to turn in. Well then by, I think 
late-‘90s, they changed it. I think that’s part of Phil Condit’s deal, it was like really 
pushing education for the employees, and they opened it all—‘I don’t care what 
degree you get’—and so I ended up getting my master’s. So, you know, from that 
standpoint, yeah, I ended up getting two degrees paid for. It was a great program, I 
encouraged any of my coworkers, said, you know, ‘you’re fools if you don’t take 
advantage of this.’ But, you know, some were—as I said, I was, a lot of them were 15 
years older than I was and, you know, ‘there’s no way I’m going back to school.’ But, 
you know, that was a really positive program, and I don’t know if they’re still doing 
it or not. 
 
Let’s talk about that sort of thing a little more, then, um, that was obviously a great 
benefit, what other—you were there for 12 years, there must have been some 
rewarding things about working there. 
 
Yeah. When—working on the 737 new gen, and when it came in it was weird, like, 
‘ooo, that new plane smell,’ it was just really bizarre. And, uh, my family always 
wanted to know what part of the plane I worked on, I never told them because the 
joke was, ‘oh, I heard a Boeing plane came down, I bet it was a part you worked on!’ 
So I was just like, ‘you don’t know what part of the plane I worked on, ok?’ But, um, 
in some ways you just—even then I was doing historical stuff for the company, 
and… what they did during World War II, pushing out all those B-29s, just 
incredible. Now, granted, you didn’t have all the complexities on the planes like you 
do now, but it was just amazing—and, and the materials, the tooling, they were just 
pushing them out. So it is pretty amazing what, you know, in retrospect, looking 
back, what was going on in Plant 2. And you can still see the remnants from the 
World War II-era, and even, there are some buildings still older than that. When I 
was there, when I first came on board, the joke was, ‘if I don’t come back in an hour 
you’d better come find me, because I’m lost,’ and, cause it’s, I don’t think people 
understand how huge that facility is. And when I first came on board they had the 
wire harness. And there was these women that would—they had these big boards 
and these diagrams and they would make the wire harness, take strings of wire, and 
they would assemble the wire. It’s just incredible. Then they ended up offloading 
that or taking that back up, I believe, to Seattle. You know, in some ways, I’m not 
saying—I don’t mean this as detrimental to the company, but, you know, this whole 
idea about Boeing and its reputation, and then when I came on board, seeing that by 
hand, seeing engineers still working on boards and not up to speed technology-wise, 
in that aspect, really surprised me. 
 
You mean Boeing’s reputation as this cutting edge— 
 
30:39 
 
Yeah. And I was very surprised that, that still astounded me, that they’re still on the 
drafting tables and… but by late-‘90s that had changed, definitely, certainly with the 
new gen, everything’s on CATIA now and up to speed. Um, oh gosh, since I’m just 
telling stories here— 
 
Well, but it sounds like you felt like becoming part of this company that had—
regardless of how up-to-date it was technologically—had this history of doing kind of 
very great things, it sounds like that’s something you found to be a rewarding thing. 
 
You know, it was. At the time—I think I still have it tucked away somewhere—they 
celebrated their anniversary, I forgot which one, but they were giving out these 
commemorative jackets. You know, they had the little patches, say, ‘from year blah-
blah-blah to whatever’ and I thought that was kind of neat. But, yeah, understanding 
the history, I thought they could have pushed more of that to really let the folks 
know what they were doing. So—and knowing that the competition was basically 
down to the few planes that people were buying from McDonnell Douglas, and then 
with the upstart called Airbus. But everybody knows Boeing planes. So that, in a 
sense, um… I was up in Chicago one year and went to the… Space? Shoot, what 
museum is that? Not the Living History, but the other one where they have all the 
human body parts and all this kind of stuff. Well, they had a cutaway 727—not real 
body parts, you know, plastic stuff—but they had a cutaway 727 that you could walk 
on and see it. And I think that was amazing. Because I had no idea how a plane was 
put together, now I do, and it’s like, ‘oh my god, that’s just held together by these 
rivets and stiffeners and this very thin skin,’ and that’s pretty amazing. But yeah, 
understanding the intricacies and the people that have pulled this together—I mean, 
like I said, I don’t believe a lot of them were college educated, but they were 
definitely skilled, and that the company took a chance on a lot of these folks worked 
out very, very well. They obviously were well paid for the area, you know, it gave a 
lot of folks… start a family, and do that whole thing. Um, the one thing—I don’t tell 
too many, I don’t really think much about Boeing and tell that many stories until 
asked— 
 
You mean you literally don’t think that much about it? 
 
No, unless somebody prompts me or they ask me something, or there’s a situation 
I’ll recall something, but, you know, since this is an oral history project… Back then, 
like, they were doing—understanding processes, how to make processes better, and 
more efficient. And one of the jobs, this is when I still worked nacelles, we were 
given this project to document Stage 1, 2, 3, how you put this piece together. And so, 
my coworker and I were out taking pictures and we had to put it on this chart and 
all this kind of stuff, right? And I remember my lead going, ‘you can’t do that.’ I’m 
like, ‘well, why not?’ He says, ‘you can’t do that.’ I said, ‘well, that’s part of the 
process.’ Cause this is still hands-on, she can’t get it fixed, she takes a mallet, just 
starts beating the hell out of it to get it to fit in. He goes, ‘you can’t show that!’ ‘Well, 
ok, I don’t know how else you’re gonna do it, but that’s exactly what she does.’ She 
doesn’t do it on every piece, but sometimes because it is so intricate… it’s not 
straight, it’s very round, and you have to get things mated right, and if you don’t, 
that’s the best way she could get it to work. And she’s up there, I mean you’re talking 
multi-million dollar plane here, and we’re still climbing up, wham! And I was just 
like, ‘oh my gosh, this is just too wild.’ Here we are, not quite turn of the century and 
we’re still doing this. Ok— 
 
Banging things with mallets. 
 
Yeah, yeah, I hope they would have corrected that problem by now. But, you know, 
it’s just those little things a lot of people don’t realize. But, yeah, it still really was—
very much was a hands-on process. And you only knew about that until you really 
started getting into how they did assemblies and put things together. You know, 
there was another part, I said, ‘oh my god, how do you guys not blow your back out?’ 
Big jig into a door. Once again, fairly intricate into a doorway. And you had to get the 
parts straight? And there’s this big jig. I go, ‘how do you get that in there?’ Big, hefty 
guy gets it, and he backs up into the doorway and he sets the jig in. 
 
He just picked it up and backed it up in there? 
 
35:34 
 
But it takes a big guy. And I’m just going, ‘oh my god. Oh my god.’ Yeah. So it’s just 
those goofy little things, but then you had some really top-of-the-line technology 
going at the same time. I just went, ‘this is…’ 
 
A huge aerospace company, and mallets and big guys picking things up. 
 
Yeah, I would hope they have corrected those problems. I’m sure somebody, if they 
listened to this would go, ‘what are you talking about? That doesn’t happen.’ 
 
Did, um—when they split off to Spirit did you have any personal reaction? 
 
It surprised me. 
Did it? 
 
Oh yeah. It really did. 
 
Because you’d been gone for a couple of years then— 
 
Yeah, I’d come back to Wichita fairly frequently and go out to lunch with some of my 
old coworkers and, you know, see how they were doing. But yeah, when I heard 
they’d split off to Spirit, it’s like, ‘wow, that is…’ But then they said most of the things 
didn’t change. It’s just like, take the sign off of Boeing and put up Spirit. It’s the same 
thing, the same processes. You know, it’s only till reading these other transcripts I 
realize, oh, there were changes. As I told Jay (Price) this morning, reading Jennifer’s 
(Marshall) comment about how they did layoff notices. That was… that was really 
cold. 
 
If one truck came it was good and if another truck came it was bad. 
 
Well, before, like I told Jay this morning, your manager would call you in—at least, 
in my area they would call you in—and talk to you and tell you, and, you know, 
probably had a little kiss-and-cry thing going and then you went off, but they gave 
you 60 day notices, warn notices. None of this impersonal, get the letter—that, that I 
thought was very telling. That is really, really business. 
 
And then, so, obviously a couple of years ago we got to Boeing leaving Wichita 
completely. How did you react to that? 
 
‘Oh shit.’ That was it, I was like—really surprised me. But then I thought, ‘wait a 
minute, they’re just talking what I would refer to as the mod side.’ And so then when 
I started hearing just how many employees I didn’t realize it was that low. 
 
A couple thousand at this point, because a lot of them had gone on over to Spirit. 
 
And then understanding that they did all this stuff, trying to get the contract and 
everything, you know, and part of me felt bad, but part of me, when I read the 
article, ‘hey, if it’s business,’ and they started putting out other areas—how much, 
was so much cheaper per worker… I said if you’re wearing a business hat, you’re 
gonna look at that. And, you know, ‘but they promised us, they…’ So what? 
 
It’s a business? 
 
It’s a business. I’m sorry, I mean—so, the ruthlessness of it, I understood. Now, if I 
was more heavily involved then yeah, I’d probably be upset. You know, initially on 
this program we talked about it, I said, ‘no, your story will be if Spirit ever leaves. 
That’s your story. That will be huge.’ 
 
Because of how many people ended up going over there from Boeing.  
 
You know, what is it now, about 12,000? 
 
It’s something like that. 
 
That’s still huge, but the idea that no longer are you going to see these fuselages on 
the rail lines—I mean, that was kind of neat, to, every now and then I’d be criss-
crossing the country, I’d see this big cigar-shaped thing, I’m like, ‘oh, that’s a fuselage 
going somewhere.’ You know, so, understanding that… but, yeah, that would be 
huge. And, you know, the initial reaction—and I guess in some ways I wasn’t 
surprised that there wasn’t much more of an anger. I don’t know if people have just 
gotten used to, now—and there was always this animosity between Boeing Seattle 
and Boeing Wichita. I don’t think anything could have changed that. 
 
Was that something you could tell while you were working there even? 
 
Mmm-hmm. 
 
Did you just feel not as respected by them? 
 
40:02 
 
Yeah, I think that was the general feeling, they were just thinking, ‘a bunch of damn 
farmers in Wichita.’ I mean, you didn’t hear too many people from Seattle coming to 
Wichita. You heard plenty going from Wichita to Seattle. Um, yeah, there was always 
that feeling. And they always come and say, ‘we could fly a plane, we could fly a 
plane out from here,’ yeah, I always heard that comment. You know, then I head 
reasons why that never happened, it was political, whether Seattle was the place 
and that’s where people went, they’d schmooze—I shouldn’t say schmooze, but they 
could do much better with potential customers, that type of thing. You know, and 
Boeing Wichita—I mean, Boeing did start in Seattle, I mean there’s no denying that. 
And if you really get into the history, the whole family atmosphere really started 
with the GM J. Schaefer. 
 
Tell me a little bit about that, I guess I don’t know. 
 
That guy. He—if I remember my history correct, he was Army, Army Air Corps 
during World War I, and he knew Hap Arnold, and he knew some of these early 
aviation dudes. And, ok, they get started ‘20s, definitely hit rock bottom ‘30s, I mean, 
I’ve heard different stories, ‘seven employees left by 1930,’ or something. Wasn’t it 
funny that ol’ Schaefer managed to get the contract to make the Stearman Trainer, 
and I’ve always thought there’s a good story for a historian to really look at, I think it 
was a connection with their buddy in the Army Air Corps. And I think he still kept in 
contact, I think he just had that right personality and he was a GM for so long. And 
you really listen to the old timers from that time, you know, you really did get a 
sense of a family thing, you really did. They took care of you, and certainly by the 
‘50s with the baseball teams, the swimming pools and all these activities, oh yeah, 
it’s—so I think the whole family culture really started with J. Schaefer, so you—the 
GM, Schaefer—so you gotta look back on understanding that Boeing culture. And 
how you understand why there’s numerous generations at the plant. 
 
So, something we’ve talked about in a lot of these interviews, and certainly I’ll ask 
you—there’s that family atmosphere, did you see other parts, um, of Boeing’s 
interaction with the community, either positively or negatively, um— 
 
Certainly the sponsorship of so many activities and, you know, for lack of a better 
word, charities. One thing that was very interesting I wasn’t used to when I came on 
board was not quite being strong-armed to join—to give up some of your money out 
of your paycheck to United Way. Wasn’t quite used to that. 
 
They won’t quite say that you ‘have to’ do it. 
 
No, they didn’t say it in so many words, but, you know, you’d have this competition 
between different groups or… ‘you know, if you want your boss to like, really kinda 
like you’ or, you know, stupid crap like that. You know, just sign the card, let ‘em 
take five bucks out of your—you know, that type of thing. And that happened, I don’t 
know, no more than two or three years, and then that started slowly fading away. 
 
The whole—the strong-arming? 
 
Yeah, yeah. I wasn’t used to that, that was a—I do remember that and I thought that 
was, hmmm… Um, when I was—had my sponsor and I was starting to explore 
possibly management, you would get called—or you could volunteer—and so you 
would work different programs in the city, you know, obviously representing 
Boeing, that type of thing, so… Yeah, it was—and even, um, we did our own little 
charity thing, we had a—I ran the coffee mess, and so we actually made money one 
year, or at least pretty consistently when I was running it, that we would have an 
excess. So, instead of just throwing it into a kitty we would sponsor—I remember 
one year somebody knew some cops that knew some pretty hard-luck kids, so we 
took ‘em shopping, and, you know, that type of thing. So, yeah, we would do that, or 
sometimes instead of doing that we would call up different utilities and say, you 
know, ‘who—we got some excess money here, who needs—behind, or you know, 
who needs to get their electric bill paid,’ stuff like that. So yeah, yeah. 
 
So, look some time into the future, and I don’t know if it’s 10 or 20 or 50 years, but 
what’s Boeing going to have meant to Wichita a few decades from now? What’s that 
legacy, as we’ve been saying? 
 
45:13 
 
I would like to think that it would be here, but I don’t think it will. There’s nothing 
that says “Boeing,” you know, someone I think has mentioned there’s no Boeing 
Arena or anything. You know, generations come and go, memories certainly fade 
very quickly. I—you know, it sounds really negative, but I don’t think there’ll be an 
impact, like they’ll remember. 
 
At some point it’ll just fade and— 
 
I do. Because you don’t… you don’t have an historical institution that really 
promotes—I believe, when I come back to visit, and even when I was here—boom, 
Boeing. Boom, Cessna. That really shows—or even when you come into the city, do 
you see a big sign that says, ‘Welcome to the Air Capital’? Or is there one? 
 
I mean, I’ve not seen one. 
 
Yeah. So, I think it’s just gonna unfortunately fade away. Which is really sad—I 
should have thought, I should have brought it, I gave Jay—bought him one—In 1931, 
I believe, Depression’s going on, but the Southwestern Lumberman’s Association 
had a huge conference here. Huge. That had to go to two hotels. But the nameplate, 
instead of those cheapy plastic things they give you now, they actually had stamped 
out Kansas, they had its industries—an oil derrick, wheat stalks, you know, 
whatever—they had little planes, north south east and west, and all going like that, 
right to Wichita. They were really promoting that—I just don’t see that. 
 
Yeah, well, I mean, I wonder, because I think everyone here, at least, knows that we call 
ourselves the Air Capital of the World. Are you thinking maybe after some period of 
time that might not even be the case anymore? 
 
I think maybe it will still register as Air Capital, but, seriously, when I got offered the 
job at Boeing, I didn’t even know there was Boeing Wichita. I knew Boeing Seattle. 
 
So you knew that the company existed. 
 
Yeah, and I remember as a kid saying, yeah, when the 747 came out, oh, that was big 
news. I remember that. But it was never Boeing in Kansas, it was always— 
 
You were just one state away. 
 
Yeah. I had no idea. But I wasn’t—my family wasn’t aviation buffs or anything like 
that, but yeah, I had no idea. So then when I came down here and I was, started 
doing my little side history projects and stuff like that, I was like, ‘wow, how come 
they’re not promoting?’ You know, I found this crazy little badge from a long time 
ago, how come they’re not doing more with that? I mean, this really great history of 
basically farmers who—great mechanical skills, and made this place. I mean, this is 
really phenomenal, and it’s almost like, ‘you know, whatever.’ I mean, that’s how I 
felt as an outsider coming into the community. 
 
That’s really interesting. I wonder why that is. I wonder if everybody here has 
internalized it so much, that we are the Air Capital, that it doesn’t occur to us to, uh— 
 
You know, I don’t know, or is it just the culture of people not wanting to, ‘look at me, 
look at me!’ I go back to that 1931 conference because that was one of the big selling 
points—you bring your spouse and you can fly in one of the planes, and they would 
take the spouses around, I mean it was big news. I mean, they really promoted—this 
is the Lumberman’s Association for god’s sakes, but yet, your little nameplate, one of 
the little side trips, aviation. 
 
Everything aviation. 
 
Yeah. Cranking out for World War II, you know, and all this kind of stuff? And you 
just—yeah, so I just, maybe it’s just part of that culture, the Central Plains—I make it 
large—the Central Plains culture, it’s like, ‘well, you know, we don’t bring attention 
to ourself, and…’ whatever. 
 
Well, you grew up in Nebraska, I mean, I’m imagining it’s not that much different. 
 
You know, in some ways it’s not. You know, but then again, Lincoln is not a 
manufacturing town, it’s a college town, and it’s all Cornhuskers. 
 
Well, we have basically gone through the things I wanted to hit, but I’m happy to talk 
about more if you had other things in mind when you were on your way here. 
 
49:57 
 
I don’t—gosh, I don’t do well just off-the-cuff. 
 
It’s hard when I open it up like that. 
 
Yeah, cause I think, what else do I want to say about it? It’s just—the one thing I 
found very interesting, um, working here, and I’ll share these stories with you, how 
many people—you know, one side I say ‘really talented people’ and they were, I was 
also surprised how many people really hated their jobs. 
 
Is that right? 
 
Oh god yeah. They wanted to be farmers but they couldn’t support their habit of 
farming without Boeing. And I ran across so many people—I shouldn’t say ‘so many,’ 
I’m not gonna say like 90%, that’s not even close—but some of the disgruntlement 
was, some people really hated their jobs, but it paid the best, had the best benefits, 
and they were willing to put in their eight hours or whatever so they could do 
farming in the evenings and on the weekends. 
 
That’s really interesting, was this mostly older people or did you find some of the 
younger people felt the same way? 
 
I felt it was the older ones. There was one woman, I still remember this, she would 
work overtime like crazy. She had a really good attitude though, just bubbly and 
everything. And I said, ‘why are you working so much overtime? This is crazy, you 
have no life.’ And when it was really going strong, it’s nothing to put in 10, 12 hour 
days. And she goes, ‘I’m working these hours so my kid doesn’t come out here. By 
god, he’s going to college.’ Yeah. I was like, wow. 
 
That takes some fortitude, I think. I mean, it sure doesn’t sound like she liked it enough 
to—certainly not enough to want her kids to do it, but she was willing to do that so— 
 
And, you know, that was the—at the time you always hear the comment of the 
‘golden handcuff.’ That’s what it was. 
 
The pay and the benefits were so good that you just couldn’t get out.  
 
Yeah, and that was another thing, I think, you know, I mentioned this before, prior to 
this, um, yeah, Boeing was the big player, the aircraft player, ok? So, when you got 
laid off, then you go and knock on Cessna or Beech’s door, Lear… and you get hired 
back on. And then when Boeing hired—you know, called back, then you would leave. 
And so, I would hear disgruntlement that way, some people hated hiring former 
Boeing employees because they would leave. But they paid the best, they had the 
best benefits, and that’s who you went to. So yeah, there was a hierarchy, yeah, 
Boeing was number one. Let’s see, what other stories, crazy stories did I hear? That 
one I do remember, um, you know, we talked a little about strikes, and I don’t know, 
I don’t think it was brought up too much in the transcripts—even now there’s still 
animosity for those people who have no association with aviation—every time 
there’s a strike, oh my god, it is the same thing. ‘I don’t know what those people are 
bitching about, they get all these great benefits, they need to really see the real 
world,’ and it’s like that every, seems like every layoff, every downturn. 
 
Yeah, the people who don’t have any connection don’t actually know what people are 
doing for their jobs. And that’s what we’ve heard from the people who, certainly, 
worked with the unions and dealt with the strikes, is that they did hear that, but that if 
the people who are complaining like that came and actually tried to do their jobs for a 
while they would understand. 
 
Or, I would always say, ‘yeah but if they had an opening I bet you’d be there going 
hire me, hire me.’ But that was always—you know, and then, you know, down 
times… Money Town, the infamous pawn shop, would always get their stuff, and 
then up times—and yeah, so that was going on. Um, gosh, what else? Of course, once 
the thing’s finished I’m sure I’ll think of some more things. 
 
That’s how it works. 
 
But, you know, I think for the shift, I think they—you know, unless you get some 
other interviewees, I think it was pretty much even keel, certainly the big push 
getting the 47 out during the, what, late ‘60s, early ‘70s? Was big news… um, the 
culture, I mean, these are great stories I wish somebody would capture—Plant 2, 
World War II plant, big floor, huge floor, huge floor, sea of desks, and this is a time 
when everybody could smoke, I mean you’d go walk into this fog, and telephones on 
everybody’s desk, and you just—and thinking about, wow, working in that type of 
environment, and that’s what you would do every day, you just—you know, here I 
was, now they’re in cubes and everything, but, you know, that was back in the ‘80s 
they were still doing that sea of desks and everybody smoking and all this kind of 
crazy stuff, um, just contently putting out, pushing out planes, and then I think the 
real transformation, though, is in the ‘90s. I think, more educated workforce, they 
knew they had an older workforce going, and then that transition of waking up—
new planes and it’s going to be a business now. 
 
With the merger and—do you think that corporate business culture was a larger shift 
outside of just the Boeing-McDonnell Douglas merger at that time? 
 
I think it was prevalent in most businesses. I really do. Um, because I was looking at 
other business, and you’re constantly hearing mergers and this type of thing, so, 
yeah, I think it was just—not gonna say follow a trend, it’s just like a lot of 
businesses were going through this transition. I mean, huge businesses. And yeah, 
Boeing was part of it. I mean, as I told you, that one incident of still doing hands-on 
stuff. Why are we still doing hands-on stuff? We’re getting ready to go to the turn of 
the century, 21st century, and we’re still doing too much hands-on, it should be, a lot 
of it should be automated. Or something. And then you wonder why there’s all this 
cost. 
 
I’d be curious to know how much it’s changed since. 
 
Yeah, so would I.
