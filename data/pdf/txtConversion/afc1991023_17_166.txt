I was born 
in New Gretna on Dec. 
10, 1917. 
My name is 
Benjamin Austin Allen. 
I learned to garden through my parents 
and others 
in the area. 
Most everybody here has a garden, or 
they used to. 
I love to have fresh stuff -- I know what's on 
it. 
I don't use many chemicals. 
I use king crabs and mussels and 
stuff from the bay for fertilizer. 
I gather them for myself. 
I 
plant a cover crop of winter rye 
in the winter and plow it under 
in the spring. 
It holds the soil and keeps it from blowing. 
This is good sandy soil -- I rarely add peat moss. 
I don't use 
too many insecticides. 
I just pick the bugs off and kill them. 
Potato bugs drove me crazy this year. 
They're the worst -- they 
also attack tomatoes. 
We also had the Japanese beetle this year, 
but the seagulls came and helped out with them. 
Japanese beetles 
eat shrubbery, and anything else that 
has a leaf on 
it. 
The 
spray I tried this year didn't work on the potato bugs. 
Besides, 
the price of the spray 
is high. 
My parents used to use arsenic 
of 
lead, but we're not allowed to use things like that now. 
I've 
tried planting marigolds around other plants to keep bugs away, 
but that doesn't work either. 
5 
I have about 3/4 of an acre for my garden. 
I grow peas, 
beans, corn, tomatoes, carrots, beets, radishes, strawberries. 
I 
like Silverqueen corn. 
I used to plant Stohl's (?) Evergreen. 
Silverqueen is a good freezing corn. 
(Elaine Allen adds that she 
puts up almost all their vegetables by freezing or canning.) 
I 
Thatcher--83 
Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 1 
also grow cabbage, string beans, pole beans (limas). 
EA: 
Sometimes I freeze a little cabbage. 
You can do other things 
with 
it, 
but we don't. 
BA: 
I used to be 
in the contract business with gravel and 
sand -- now I'm retired. 
sand mining, G—New Gretna; 15GT. 
They 
don't let you mine anything anymore around here. 
It's 
impossible. 
I put the trucks and the tractor in the garage about 
ten years ago, when they first started the environmental stuff, 
and that was 
it -- I was just done. 
I couldn't use them anymore, 
I couldn't dig, so I just run them in the garage. 
That truck 
looks like it's brand—new. 
I don't want to see people tear 
things to pieces, but there's a limit. 
There's some things which 
you should be able to do. 
You can't even get a load of gravel 
around here for your driveway or nothing. 
If you get it you have 
to get it out of another township. 
And the price -- compared 
with what I used to get -- I'd be a millionaire in about a week's 
time. 
I used to charge six dollars for five yards. 
Now they 
charge about ninety dollars for five yards. 
The sand I got was 
used for road work and filling in around docks. 
I bought the 
sand 
in a regular pit where I dug 
it -- I used a digger -- a big 
diesel front—end loader. 
It's 
in the garage too. 
I did it all 
myself -- no help. 
I've done that kind of work ever since I was 
a kid. 
I started working around cranberry bogs with the trucks 
for building dams for the cranberries. 
I started when I was 
about fourteen years old. 
My dad did a little bit of everything, 
too. 
He worked around the bay, and I did too -- clamming, 
oystering. 
I haven't done it this year or last year because of 
my ulcer. I'm a jack of all 
trades, I am. 
For clamming and oystering I used regular tongs and rakes. 
I did that by myself, too. 
Hell, I've worked for myself all 
my 
life. 
Except when I was 
in the army for four years. 
I went in 
in 
'42 and went to the South Pacific. 
Got a piece of shrapnel 
through my throat. 
10 
We have one son. 
He hasn't done the things I've done. 
He's 
in the Navy -- career. 
He can do oystering and dirt farming, 
though. 
In the spring I plow the land with my big tractor using 
discs and things. 
You plow it up first and disc it up -- work 
the soil. 
Depending on the weather, you start around the last of 
March or the first of April. 
We have plenty of snow here, so I 
have to wait for the frost. 
I use a hand rototiller for weeding 
between the rows. 
After working the soil, I plant the seeds by 
hand. 
I plant a little bit of everything. 
(Interviewer asks 
what he plants the most of, and his wife pipes up, sounding 
chagrined, "Tomatoes." 
Interviewer then encourages her to talk 
more.) 
EA: 
I can the tomatoes and share them with my son and 
his wife. 
I cut them up 
in pieces and make tomato juice and 
tomato sauce out of them. 
BA: 
After planting, pulling weeds and 
picking off bugs is the main activity. 
You can't grow weeds and 
vegetables at the same time -- 
it won't work. 
The weeds always 
Thatcher--83 
Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 2 
grow faster than the vegetables. 
It's most important that you 
weed around the plants, not just between the rows. 
I spend 
morning til night in the garden every day. 
Strawberries are usually the first thing to harvest, and 
peas and other early crops. 
The strawberries are not everbears, 
and they didn't work with the climate here. 
EA: 
We 
like to eat 
the things as they come 
in, 
and then I freeze whatever we don't 
eat at a meal. 
I freeze strawberries plain, then take them out 
and cook them -- they're too mushy otherwise -- and have 
strawberry shortcake in the wintertime. 
Peas we freeze. 
I use 
bags for them. 
I learned to can from Benjamin's mother, not 
mine. 
I can tomatoes and peaches. 
15 
(Interviewer moves mike stand to better reach both Elaine 
Allen and Benjamin Allen.) 
BA: 
Radishes are another early crop, 
and we just eat those. 
We share our garden with everybody that 
comes along, not just family. 
EA: 
That's his pleasure. 
Everybody here always has plenty of zucchini, and we all make 
zucchini bread, using seasonings like 
in a spice cake. Nutmeg, 
cinnamon, cloves. 
Very small amounts of these spices. 
We freeze 
the zucchini bread. 
BA: 
I have a little Indian blood 
in me -- Lanni Lanape. 
My 
mother was a Mathis, and they were some of the earliest settlers 
in this area. 
EA: 
My ancestry is German. 
I have a few German 
recipes from my family -- mostly Christmas cookies -- springerle 
and others with nuts and flour. 
20 
(Interviewer asks for other people 
in the area who might be 
good contacts.) 
BA: 
Walter Mathis would be good -- he's been 
around here all 
his life, worked around in the bay. 
Also Alston 
"Bussy(?)" Allen. 
He's a retired marine policeman. 
He's a good 
storyteller. 
EA: 
He has a good knack with words. 
(They also 
show the interviewer George Heinrich's house when she mentions 
that she will 
be talking with him soon.) 
BA: 
I made those little windmills out of Clorox bottles to 
scare birds and deer, but it didn't work. 
The deer come out of 
the swamp, and they'll walk right up to the house. 
A baby deer 
came right up to me once, but it was sick. 
(They show the 
pictures of it.) 
EA: 
It wanted to sit on our laps. 
BA: 
We 
gave 
it to a lady who has deer -- she fed it baby formula, but it 
died the next day. 
BA: 
I bought one section of this house when I came out of 
the Army, and I added on the kitchen and other parts. 
It must be 
about 50 years old. 
The woodwork is pine -- probably southern 
pine. 
The house is mostly built of 
local cedar, though. 
It was 
built by a couple of old guys -- local people, one was a good 
carpenter. 
25 
(Interviewer: 
We're in the living room, and you have a 
dining room and a kitchen, and the room off the living room is 
an 
office.) EA: 
Yes, I'm the school board secretary, and that's my 
office. 
Then we have a bedroom in the back. 
There's also a 
Thatcher--83 
Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 3 
basement. 
I work full—time -- I consider it 24 hours a day, but 
I work out of my home. 
I've been doing it for 23 years. 
It 
changes constantly.

Last year I had a row of beautiful dahlias along the edge of 
the garden, but this year it was too dry for them. 
Then I have a 
row of strawberries that I just set out this spring. 
I put in 
two rows of strawberries and let them go for two years then plow 
them under and plant a new row, alternating rows each year. 
Old 
rows don't do so well -- they get full of grass, and you can't 
keep them clean. 
The next section is planted in winter rye, just 
coming up. 
I just spread the seed out and run over it with the 
disc to just turn it under so the birds don't get it. 
The winter 
rye will 
look just like a lawn after a while. 
Next to the garden 
at this point is a red delicious apple tree. 
It isn't doing very 
well. I'll have to cut a limb off because it got a bug 
in 
it that 
did a lot of damage. 
The bug had features just like a crab. 
I 
killed the bugs 
in the limb by pouring motor oil 
in there. 
Further up 
is a pear tree -- about six feet high, and my wife has 
canned about eight pints off of 
it, 
and we've eat some of them 
fresh -- Bartlett pears. 
Next is 
an Elberta peach tree that I 
picked twelve and a half baskets from -- half—bushel baskets. 
The cherry tree, further down, also had problems this year. 
It 
got a kind of mildew -- like a black soot on 
it. 
I found the 
best thing would work on 
it 
is, take about a quart of bleach with 
two gallon of water, and I sprayed that -- in fact, I sprayed the 
peach tree and all 
the trees that way 'cause they get like a 
mildew right on the ends of them and it'll kill the whole 
Thatcher--83 
Reel—to—reel logs 
page 5 
stinkin' thing. 
Last year it was just as black as 
ink. 
They 
break off. 
But they come out of 
it pretty good after that. 
(animal), (plant), folk medicine. 
These poles lying alongside the trees are stakes for the 
lots I have in the bay -- the clam lots and oyster lots. 
The bay 
is all surveyed out like land and each one has different lots and 
you have to mark them with stakes in the water. 
We lease the 
lots from the state each year. 
You have to replace stakes 
because the ice can take them. 
If 
it does take a stake, you 
usually have several on a corner so that you can find the 
stubbles, and you have ranges on the land that help you find your 
lots. 
5 
Next is a row of yams (after the winter rye). 
We'll dig 
them after the frost has killed the vines. 
I keep them and the 
potatoes in a crawl—in cellar. 
My wife usually bakes, boils, or 
fries them -- almost anything. 
They also make good sweet potato 
pie, just like pumpkin pie. 
Then there's a row of chinese 
cabbage. 
They like cooler weather like lettuce. 
So far they 
haven't done much because it's been dry. 
They make the best 
coleslaw you've ever seen. 
The leaves are loose, so you can't 
grate it, but you can chop it up fine. 
Most everybody goes crazy 
for chinese cabbage. 
It will mature toward the last of October. 
It grows right quick after you get it started. 
Next there is some more rye. 
As I harvest things, I will 
plant more rye, and the whole field will be 
in rye. 
There's one 
cabbage plant in the corner by the tomatoes. 
This year I had a 
good cabbage crop, but the ground hogs got into them. 
They eat 
the center out and leave everything else. 
They ate forty—five 
heads out of the row. 
The next row is tomatoes -- lots of them. 
They're just about done now. 
I have plum tomatoes and regular 
ones. 
The plum tomatoes are 
in a box—type cage that keeps them 
up off the ground and prevents them from getting brown spots on 
them. 
The regular tomato plants are in round wire and post 
cages. 
The next row 
is pole beans -- pole limas. 
I picked them 
yesterday. 
String beans don't grow on poles, just on the ground. 
There's also an 
improved lima called bunch limas that don't need 
poles, but mine didn't do too well this year. 
The bunch limas 
are 
in between the pole beans and the string beans. 
There's a 
lot of stuff I've already taken out, 
like peas. 
Here's another 
section of rye, and another row of yams and another of tomatoes. 
When I set my tomatoes out early, I use soda bottles with the 
bottoms out off over the plants. 
When I see that it's going to 
be cold, I just screw the 
lid on. 
It works like a hothouse, and 
they really take off. 
Another section of rye, and a section 
where there were squash and zucchini, and I just plowed them 
under the other day with my disc. 
Then there's a row of cabbage 
that is about done. 
Then there's another row of tomatoes. 
I 
planted them later than I planted the other tomatoes, and I had 
some extra space in the garden, so I put them in. 
But I haven't 
Thatcher--83 
Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 6 
picked many of them, and they didn't do very well. 
Behind the 
garden is the woodpile. 
We heat the whole house with the wood— 
burning stove and two transfer fans between the kitchen and the 
dining room. 
10 
Here's a Norway maple tree behind the fruit trees. 
There 
are two holly trees behind the house. 
One's male and one's 
female. 
It's hard to tell when you go 
into the woods to get them 
which is the male and which is the female, but it's best to have 
both of them close together. 
I pruned the one holly tree up high 
off the ground so I could get under it with the lawn mower. 
I 
should do the same thing with the other one. 
(Interviewer asks 
if 
the one without the berries is the male tree. 
He said yes.) 
I rigged up a burner for scrap paper and stuff out of a hot 
water tank. 
I have a welder. 
I told you I'm a jack of all 
trades. 
I do all 
the mechanical work on the tractors, trucks and 
cars. 
I built the garage out of cinder blocks in 1951. 
I added 
another section onto it 
in 1971, and it 
is made out of weigh— 
light (Way—Lite?) blocks. 
(Interviewer goes over to the little Clorox bottle windmills 
to take pictures and record the sound. 
Mr. Allen doesn't have a 
name for them.) 
I have an electric fence around the garden. 
(It 
turns out that the sound 
is from a wind machine with a propeller, 
not from the Clorox bottles which are also turning rapidly, but 
not making noise.)

The Pine Barrens has been studied from a couple of 
perspectives, but we don't have a record of the people. 
What it 
was forty years ago should have been recorded, but a lot of 
it 
is 
lost. 
Back then, people were just like their forefathers were 
200 years ago. 
For instance, the dialect and selection of words 
was unique to this area. 
When I came 
in here from the Southwest, 
I wasn't familiar with the deep South, and I thought when I heard 
all 
these people talking that they were all from the South 
because of their accent. 
You could tell that a person was from 
Tuckerton or New Gretna because each of those places had a unique 
dialect. (At this point, the tape recorder had a problem, so the 
interviewer fixed it and turned the recorder back on. 
Mr. West 
continued with his thoughts.) 
We should have recorded the 
people, their language, their mental attitudes and mind—set. 
We 
can study ecology and the animals, and that remains fairly 
constant, but people change. 
The big change 
is the 
homogenization of the whole U.S. 
The young people have had to 
leave as they wanted to pursue education and careers, and things 
have begun to change. 
Until the 1950s, New Gretna had not 
changed too much -- the same families were still here. 
The 
Cranmers, the Aliens, the Adams, were here and recognizable as 
being kin to someone. 
We all 
knew each other and each other's 
backgrounds. 
There were stories that followed these people 
around and identified these people. 
Each person was an 
Thatcher--83 
Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 8 
individual and no one blended into the "norm." 
He didn't work at 
this -- 
it was just a result of where he 
lived. 
No one had any 
desire to be 
like anyone else -- the thought didn't occur to 
them. 
There are very few of these people left. 
Frank Gray would 
be about the last one, and he's eighty—seven years old. 
7-10 
The people didn't make a vocation out of storytelling --
people were just people. 
But they did have stories. 
A whole 
generation of people just abruptly ended, and we didn't know the 
change was coming until 
it was too late. 
Then the "me" 
generation came that's been influenced by TV, the automobile. 
These old folks weren't mobile like we are -- weren't influenced 
by the car and travel. 
Their language stayed the same. 
Now our 
language is blending and 
it will 
be hard to distinguish one 
region from another. 
It will be 
like endless rice pudding. 
These regional differences are reflections of our roots and 
reflect the fabric of who we are. 
I have been adopted into the 
community by marriage into a stable, old family -- the Lamson 
family. 
That family has virtually died out now. 
(His wife 
drives into the yard.) 
My wife sees New Gretna differently than 
I do. 
She can't see the woods for the trees, although she does 
appreciate the town. 
We just have different perspectives. 
(Mrs. Betty West comes 
in and introductions are made.) 
Anyway, Mr. Gray is the 
last of that generation of folks who 
weren't influenced by the modern age. 
10-15 
(He asks his wife when the first phone was 
in New Gretna 
-- her parents had the second phone 
in town, and 
it was 
in the 
early 1930s.) 
The people remained the same then -- their 
attitudes didn't change so much. 
Just about everybody went to 
church then -- mostly Methodist and Presbyterian. 
Now it's not 
the thing to do to go to church. 
Then it was normal and was 
important. 
It gave direction and stability to people's lives --
it was a moderating factor. 
People who might want to drink 
whiskey didn't drink whiskey often because of the church. 
Of 
course, Methodists and Presbyterians told 
jokes on each other 
about going to the tavern 
in the next town for whiskey and hiding 
it under the car seat. 
The jokes indicate how pervasive the 
influence of the churches was. 
I was stationed in Atlantic City with the Coast Guard, and 
Betty was a nurse in the Atlantic City Hospital. 
We met through 
mutual friends. 
We didn't plan to 
live 
in New Gretna, we thought 
we'd do other things. 
But we bought a place along the river here 
in New Gretna and we 
liked it, 
so we stayed. 
People began to 
accept me because I had married Betty who was from a respected 
family. 
Her grandfather was the mayor of the town once, and her 
grandmother was the organist of the church. 
15-20 
People often ask how long 
it took for me to be accepted 
by the people here. 
Well, when we wanted to buy that first 
house, we didn't have any money. 
So we needed a loan, which was 
hard to get in New Gretna. 
We went to a friend of Betty's 
family, Mr. Cofflin (sp?), who operated the sawmill. 
He said, 
"Well, I don't know you, but I know Betty, and I know Betty's 
Thatcher--83 
Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 9 
grandfather, and I know Betty's father. 
If Betty married you, 
then 
it must be alright." 
So he 
loaned us the money. 
So I was 
accepted because of my association with the family. 
The same 
thing happened when I wanted to work in the bay. 
I built a boat 
to work in the bay for oysters and clams, but all 
of the oyster 
ground in the bay 
is marked off 
in 
lots which the state of New 
Jersey supervises. 
Each person has one or two or three lots of 
various sizes where you farm your shellfish. 
You couldn't buy a 
lot unless you were a member of one of the families in town --
all 
the lots were tied up that way. 
Closed to outsiders. 
Betty's father introduced me to Mr. Gray who was 
in charge of all 
these lots, and he told Mr. Gray that I was his son—in—law, and I 
wanted to get into oyster farming and needed a lot or two. 
In a 
couple of weeks Mr. Gray came and offered me a couple of lots. 
Mr. Gray wouldn't have given me those lots 
if there had been the 
possible chance of someone in the community objecting. 
Today people come into town, they don't want us to know 
their names, and that's unfortunate. 
People used to know exactly 
what I was doing all 
the time -- they kept track of each other. 
You didn't keep things from people. 
They were interested in what 
was going on. 
Now people wouldn't care 
if your house caught on 
fire.

There used to be a local gossip column in the newspaper 
that told what everyone was up to -- they wanted everyone to know 
what they were doing. 
We've lost that. 
If you're talking about 
real community, and not just describing a place, then that's how 
people are. 
You never heard someone say, "That's none of your 
business." (Noises in the background are Mrs. West working in the

Mr. and Mrs. Applegate moved into the house next door 
as bride and groom. 
It had a hand pump, a wood stove, and two 
small bedrooms, a living room and a kitchen -- nice porch all 
around the house, and that was it.

(story continued from PFP83—RET003) 
The Applegates lived 
in 
their house for sixty years until they were unable to care for 
themselves and went to a rest home, where they shortly died. 
Their house had the same pump, the same furniture, the same 
stove, and everything just as when they moved in sixty years 
before. 
That was an example of how New Gretna was when we first 
came here -- nothing changed. 
People didn't move. 
This kind of 
environment creates good citizens who take an 
interest in the 
welfare of the community. 
They used to mark property boundaries with trees. 
Our deed 
called for a big white oak tree at one corner -- they assumed 
that that tree would be there forever. 
They found existing 
landmarks like that and used them for boundary markers. 
We had 
to cut the tree down when it died, and now there's a metal stake 
there. 
My wife's grandmother saw the neighbor one day cutting a 
limb off that tree. 
She went and told him to quit cutting limbs 
off because it was a boundary. 
You can tell a city person who 
moves 
in 
immediately because right away he wants to mark his 
boundary. 
We didn't have any fences here until 
recently. 
A few 
years ago 
it didn't matter where the boundary was precisely --
Thatcher--83 
Reel—to—reel logs 
page 11 
approximately was good enough. 
5-10 
Betty: It 
is unusual to see fences in New Gretna. 
Floyd: 
A city person doesn't want people to intrude on his boundary. 
The old deeds say "more or less," or "to the middle of the road." 
But the road has changed position over the years. 
The house next 
door was the store, and 
it had a loading dock type entrance that 
was right on the road, and now the road 
is further away. 
There 
was a stone marker that the deed said was in the middle of the 
road, and we probed around to find it, 
afraid that it was under 
the blacktop, but it was five feet in front of the house, so the 
road has moved. 
People had no frame of reference to know that 
change would occur so rapidly as they have since the 1960s. 
I built a garvey out of Jersey cedar that grows 
in the 
swamps. 
Everyone who works in the bay knows how to build one. 
You cut your own trees and season them over the winter, and have 
them cut up at the sawmill. 
Then you build the kind of boat that 
was built two hundred years ago. 
Betty's father showed me how to 
do 
it. 
There are no plans or instructions. 
There were also a 
couple of boat builders in town for those who didn't want to 
build their own boats. 
Cooney Loveland was one. 
I watched other 
people building boats. 
And they would tell me how to do 
it. 
10-15 
Every day I had visitors coming to see how the boat was 
coming. 
This was 
in the early fifties. 
People gathered at the 
Bass River Bridge in the mornings where the party boats left. 
(Party boats were for city fishermen who wanted someone to take 
them out to fish.) 
This place was where people caught up on 
gossip and business. 
My boat was the subject of much 
conversation. 
When they saw that I did 
it right, as they would 
have done it, 
they were pleased. 
If I hadn't done 
it right, I 
would have been the subject of ridicule. 
I was accepted too, 
because I sought their advice -- I thought that they were worth 
something. 
Betty: When Floyd got involved in politics right away, first 
he became involved in the school board. 
Floyd: 
That was another 
way of showing my sincerity and interest in the community.

A sneakbox is a little rowboat that you row through the 
weeds for duck hunting. 
A Barnegat sneakbox is shaped something 
like a clam except the back 
is flat. 
It 
is all 
decked over 
except a little hole where you sit. 
The knife—edged clam shape 
gives no wind resistance. 
Sneakboxes with flat sides are river 
sneakboxes where you don't have to worry about the wind. 
(He 
sketched it out.) 
A garvey has a barge type bow that is almost 
flat across the front. 
It is flat bottomed so it 
is stable, not 
"tender." 
You can walk around in 
it. 
The accepted length here 
is 26 feet. 
Some people could use a smaller garvey and row 
it or 
pole 
it out into the bay, but in New Gretna, where you have to go 
out the Bass River, out the Mullica and then into the bay, which 
is a greater distance, the boat is 
larger and has to have inboard 
power. 
Outboard motors are looked upon with disdain.

fiberglass garvey. 
The Gomez brothers in Tuckerton were building 
those. 
New Gretna is different than inland towns like Chatsworth, 
Martha's Furnace, Batsto, because those places don't have a port 
-- the water. 
Here there was a group called the Knights of 
Pythias, 
like the Grange, and there were churches. 
Up 
in the 
pine barrens you didn't find many civic organizations like those 
New Gretna used to have Masons, too, but not now. 
We also had 
organized government, which they did not have 
in the pine 
barrens. 
Out there people lived alone, because the people who 
came there 
in the first place were antisocial, fleeing from 
authority. 
They were rebellious people. 
The pines were suited 
to them, because they could get lost in that wild and woolly 
place. 
The flavor of that is still 
in the pine barrens.

The Wunsch or Wunch family of Germans who came to New Gretna 
never did fit in until recent years when the third 
generation 
came up. 
It was a small family, though, and remained small. 
The 
predominant makeup of New Gretna is Scotch—Irish and English. 
In the early 1970s a developer came 
in and built 96 or 97 
houses on the border between Ocean County and Burlington County 
in Bass River Township -- not New Gretna, but in the township. 
Those homes were sold to people who lived in north Jersey, 
in 
Edison. 
The developer was also from that area. 
That year we 
were expecting three students in our kindergarten 
class, and we 
ended up having to build an addition to our school. 
Before that, 
we knew all the children in the school. 
That community is more 
transient. 
They often find that rural 
living 
is not suited to 
their lifestyle -- they bring a lifestyle with them. 
Then they 
move away. 
Lots of them also have families that break up. 
It 
is 
really old G—Mathistown; 15GT, and 
is now called G—Offshore Manor; 
15GT. 
Other villages in the township are G—Leektown; 15GT -- you

cross the Harrisville Bridge, and the lake 
is 
on the left, and 
the old Harrisville ruins are on the right as you come south. 
G—Harrisville; 15GT was an old settlement and 
it had gas lights. 
Then Leektown is the next community coming south. 
5-10 (Interviewer asks about origin of name of Chip's Folly 
Campground. 
He doesn't really know who Chip is or what his folly 
was.) 
Right there where you turn to go 
in Chip's Folly 
is 
G—Bridgeport; 15GT -- another old community at the bridge across 
the Wading River. 
There are a couple of houses left. 
It was 
along the old stagecoach road. 
Then Martha's Furnace was another 
old town that isn't there anymore. 
The native New Gretnan has very little influence in 
government now. 
Most of the pressure on government comes from 
people who are moving in from the cities -- especially from the 
Philadelphia/ Camden area. 
Some of 
it 
is good -- some of them 
like the rural atmosphere and want to maintain it. 
The majority 
of those people are like that. 
New Gretna is the last rural 
coastal community in Jersey. 
Once somebody at a town meeting 
said we should have signs coming into town, and I said "What 
for?" 
We don't want to attract attention. 
Let's stay rural. 
Others want house numbers, but we've never needed them before 
because people knew where everybody lived. 
It's only the people 
who move in and keep to themselves who want numbers. 
Someday 
maybe we'll have to have numbers.

Our master plan has zoning that requires large lots and 
single family dwellings. 
I served on the Pinelands Commission as 
one of the original members. 
It's going to have to change 
drastically now in the people who make up the Commission, or the 
Pine Barrens will be 
lost. 
It will be insidious, and 
it will 
happen before they know what happened. 
The Commission has a 
cloak that gives the impression that they are there to enhance, 
but actually, their actions show that the Pinelands will be gone. 
It has become too institutionalized in the public mind as 
protectors of the Pinelands. 
They give too many variances and 
waivers. 
They're giving away the Pine Barrens piecemeal 
in 
"an 
environmentally sound manner." 
The governor is not committed to 
enhancement of the Pine Barrens. 
I was kicked off the Pinelands 
Commission. 
I was replaced with a developer from Ocean County. 
And Gary Patterson was replaced with someone from north Jersey 
who knows nothing about the Pine Barrens. 
15-20 
We aren't thinking about posterity and what we will be 
leaving for them. 
We are stewards of the earth, as it says 
in 
the Bible. 
Too many people say, "That's my 
land,' and that's not 
right. 
We're stewards, and responsible. 
That's noble. 
Lots of 
people now don't want to be noble.

(Frank Gray comes in, and Floyd has him sit 
in his 
chair so the mikes are aimed at Frank.) 
Frank Gray: 
I was born 
in 
1896. 
I lived 
in New Gretna most of my 
life except for about 
a decade. 
My great grandfather Gray came from England to 
Philadelphia in 1823. 
I used to scoop huckleberries when I was 
young. 
I learned to scoop after picking for about a year. 
My 
uncle made a huckleberry scoop for me. 
One year they had a fire 
Thatcher--83 
Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 15 
in 
an area where there were lots of what they call huckleberries 
-- hog blueberries. 
The fire was 
in May. 
In the following year 
there was a terrific crop of these berries 
in the latter part of 
July. 
When you scoop them, you can't have them half green and 
half ripe. 
I scooped as many as my father did -- eight crates 
each, 32 quarts in a crate two days 
in a row. 
They were put on 
the train to New York and we were paid six cents a quart.

I entered Dickenson after World War I. 
I got 
the money to go to school by gathering blueberries in season, 
then 
in the oyster season which opened in October, I helped my 
father to gather oyster seed. 
My father paid most of my 
schooling, but I had to earn it so he would have the money. 
The Mullica River and Great Bay used to produce a lot of oysters 
and seed.

I used to know everyone in New Gretna. 
Ninety percent of 
them are gone. 
Most people used to work 
in the bay catching 
clams, oysters and fish. 
We also used to catch weakfish in May. 
Most people raised lima beans, sugar corn, potatoes. 
We sold the 
corn 
in Atlantic City hotels. 
We'd plant the corn at different 
times so we'd have four fresh crops during the summer. 
We took 
it to Atlantic City 
in a Model T Ford light truck.

The teachers got thirty dollars a 
month. 
Most people then had small gardens that helped provide 
food. 
A man 
in town got a new car and employed someone to teach 
him how to drive. 
He was just by the school one time, and all 
the kids would look out the window. 
The teacher told us not to 
look out or we would lose our recess. 
Suddenly there was a 
crash, and Mr. Lamson had hit a fence with the car, and we all 
looked, 
including the teacher. 
I'll never forget when the 
automobile was the new vehicle for the American people that was 
used to damage property.

The only cars that came through New Gretna were small 
cars that seated two people. 
They had single cylinder motors. 
Six cars might go through 
in the summer.

Frank to remember a story he told of going up to the old 
Harrisville ruins, but he 
is unsuccessful.

When you get to be 87 years old, everything seems to be 
a long time ago. 
I don't have a garden anymore. 
Now I help

My wife has diabetes and arthritis. 
New Gretna has improved. 
The houses now have electricity 
and there are more houses. 
New Gretna is a good town. 
We're

Frank has always been a positive person all 
his life.)

The houses in Tuckerton are built so that the distance 
between them isn't the length of this kitchen. 
New Gretna people 
like to have open space. 
My house was built in 1925 for $9,300. 
It was a 13 or 14 year mortgage. 
Carpenters now tell me that it 
would cost about $80-100,000. 
That's troublesome.

lures, rubber worms to catch 
them. 
Some people know how to dance them so they wobble on the 
water and 
it attracts the fish. 
You use a bobber with the rubber 
worms. 
The biggest fish I've ever caught is a four pound bass.

nearly broke the county record, which is about six and a half

I'm a third generation sneakbox builder. 
I learned the 
skill from my father who died 
in 
1975, and he wanted to pass the 
skill along. 
I had three brothers, but I was the only one 
interested. 
I started in 
1972. 
My younger brother is starting 
to get interested so we can keep 
it 
in the family. 
I've been in 
the boat business all my life -- it's 
in the blood -- my father 
and all 
of his family were boatbuilders. 
I helped my father when 
I was young. 
He built garveys early in his career. 
The garvey 
is a flat boat -- some are completely flat and some are what we 
call a V—bottom garvey, and they're clam boats -- work boats. 
The sneakbox is for duck hunting. 
They're easy to hide 
in the 
grass, and don't draw much water -- can go 
in 
real shallow water. 
They also have flat bottoms. 
You just pull these sneakboxes up 
into the sedge grass and they're hid, without too much covering 
them up. 
You just throw a little grass over them. 
They're 
decked over, and have an opening big enough to fit a man or a man 
and a boy--they're only 12 feet long. 
A garvey can be up to 
thirty feet long. 
Sneakboxes have sort of a round bow. 
(George 
picks up a miniature sneakbox made by his brother and shows ET 
the shape.) 
They put outboard motors on them. 
It's a quicker 
and easier way to get to where you're hunting. 
You need them 
when the wind's blowing. 
They have high wind resistance because 
they're built low to the water (?). 
But they are very seaworthy. 
My grandfather used to say that if you could cover the hatch up, 
Thatcher--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 23 
you could go to England in one of them. 
I was born in Tuckerton. 
My family is a Tuckerton family. 
They go back at least to the 1800s. 
In 1972 I was working at the Minhayden (?) fish plant--they 
handled bunkers, and I didn't get interested 
in sneakboxes until 
my father got sick and he talked us 
into building them. 
I have 
one brother who 
is an automobile mechanic and another who 
is a 
house carpenter, and they weren't interested in building boats. 
The other younger brother next to me, he worked at building 
boats, but he didn't have no patience to build sneakboxes. 
So 
I've been building them ever since, and I enjoy it. 
If I had 
more time, so I'm not pressured, I like to work on them. 
It's a 
very tedious job. 
Everything must fit or you throw it away. 
(ET asks what George's father's occupation was -- 
if 
he was 
a bagman.) 
No -- well, back 
in those days everybody done the bay 
work and they built their own rigs. 
He's built a lot of boats. 
The same with my grandfather. 
My grandfather owned a railway 
when I was a kid. 
In Prohibition days the railway was used as 
storage for boats that they confiscated from rum runners. 
We're 
just completely a boat family -- that's the way we was born and 
raised. 
I only have one daughter, and she's not a boat builder. 
(Laughter.) 
I have no one to pass it on to except my brother. 
He's a boilermaker, so he's not interested in wood. 
There's one 
sneakbox builder in Waretown -- Sam Hunt. 
He went to Washington 
and built a boat there. 
There's a pretty good demand for 
sneakboxes. 
Duck hunters really want a sneakbox. 
They tried 
building fiberglass ones, but they weren't too successful. 
Mallard, Incorporated tried that. 
The Gomez Brothers didn't do 
that -- they have fiberglass garveys, though. 
Fiberglass is too 
noisy for a sneakbox -- they rattle, and a duck can hear a mile 
away. 
Also, 
if a fiberglass gets water in 
it, 
it will sink --
there's no buoyancy in them. 
At least some part of a wooden 
sneakbox will stay on top. 
Fiberglass is also very slippery when 
it gets wet. 
105 
If all the sneakbox builders disappear, the hunters will 
turn to something else. 
Some kind of ready made boats, or 
they'll gun out of the meadows from sink blinds or something. 
A 
sink blind 
is a box sunk 
in the meadows. 
They've been used for 
years -- my father and grandfather have used them for years 
they called them gunning boxes. 
I was a guide for several years 
at the fish plant, and we had a lot of those sink blinds. 
You 
just take the gunners to 
'em, put 'em 
in 
it, 
and then put the 
decoys out in the water and they were shooting out of the box. 
Those people had nothing invested in hunting. 
They'd pay for 
their day of hunting. 
We'd do the work and they'd do the 
shooting. 
Occasionally I'd get to shoot too. 
I'd shoot their 
cripplers rather than lose a duck. 
The fish plant processed bunkers for animal feeds. 
It's 
high protein. 
The plant had a hunting lodge and they entertained 
Thatcher--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 24 
their business contacts with duck hunting at the lodge. 
The 
hunters did a lot of poker playing and drinking at night. 
But we 
wouldn't take them out in the day 
if they'd been drinking -- they 
had to be sober. 
Otherwise it wasn't safe. 
We'd take them out for anywhere from a day to a week. 
They'd sleep at the lodge. 
We had a cook for the meals. 
It was 
a colored man. 
The lodge was on Crab Island in Little Egg Harbor 
Bay. 
(He referred to it also as Tuckerton Bay -- may be an 
alternate name.) 
The lodge 
is torn down now. 
I went there 
in 
1959 as a hunting guide, and I left 
in 1964-65. 
The lodge was 
torn down then. 
They had built an extraction plant for fish meal 
and they used explosive material there, so they had to do away 
with the lodge. 
Then the government clamped down on business 
entertainment expenses, so they stopped all 
that free 
entertainment. 
The fish plant has been sold out now, all 
the 
machinery is gone, and it's just turned to the elements of the 
weather. 
They owned their own boats -- didn't buy from 
independent fishermen. 
I've done 
it all -- fishing, clamming, oystering. 
I did it 
for a living long before I was married. 
Now I don't have any 
lots. 
I don't even own a boat to go 
in the bay with. 
Steps in building a sneakbox. 
First you've gotta buy the 
lumber. 
It's getting to be hard to find. 
It's being cut off, 
and 
it takes 60 to 80 years to grow back. 
It's Jersey white 
cedar. 
The Pinelands Commission is clamping down on that, and I 
think 
it has to be done -- you have to save nature, that's the 
way I feel about it. 
And when I can't get cedar no more, why, 
I'll just have to quit building sneakboxes. 
Plywood's been 
tried, but it's very hard to work with, plywood. 
Pine 
is too 
heavy. 
A man could never lift 
it after it was built. 
wood. 
1 have a jig that's built in the shape of the bottom of the 
boat, and the center plank is bolted to that, and cross timbers 
are fastened to the jig and the center plank. 
I turn the whole 
jig upside down and plank it. 
After it's planked I can take it 
off. 
I bend the planks dry very carefully. 
Each plank costs 
eight or nine dollars. 
It's hollowed out in the center of 
it so 
it can bend. 
technology. 
200 
I use brass wood screws, and everything is screwed fast 
together. 
After you take 
it off the jig, then you turn it right 
side up and plank the top. 
It's very tedious. 
Everything has to 
fit. 
On the bottom the lumber has to bend two ways. 
Plywood 
will only bend one way, that's why plywood would be hard to work 
with. 
My father built one out of plywood and he said he'd never 
build another one. 
Plywood would be light, though -- quarter 
inch plywood. 
I fiberglass over the cedar on the outside -- a 
thin layer of resin plus a thin cloth, then resin over the top of 
that. 
So 
it's almost like a fiberglass boat, only this has wood 
inside of 
it. 
It's painted on. 
You can damage 
it by hitting 
rocks or something, then you have to repair it. 
Thatcher--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 25 
People generally carry the sneakboxes on trailers, or 
sometimes in the back of a pickup truck, but it takes two men to 
lift it 
into the truck. 
Two men can gun out of one sneakbox --
it's a little cramped, but they can gun out of it. 
They'll take 
their lunch and stay all 
day. 
But now, I don't know. 
The state of New Jersey has a point system for hunting 
ducks. 
The black duck used to be the most popular duck for 
hunters, but something's happened to them -- they're not hatching 
like they did, so one black duck is 90 points now, and you're 
only allowed to kill 
100 points worth of ducks a day. 
Some 
ducks are 10 points, some are 20, 30, etc. 
The black duck 
is 
popular because they're much harder and wiser to kill. 
That's 
the reason these boats come 
in handy -- you can hide them. 
You 
have a big boat, you can't hide it. 
The black duck is somewhat 
on the order of a mallard, and you can't tell the difference 
between a male and female. 
Their meat is all 
dark. 
It's a taste 
you have to learn to 
like, really. 
It's not like a domesticated 
duck. 
I think the black duck is the best tasting duck, but it 
depends on what he feeds on. 
A lot of ducks will dive for their 
feed, and a black duck doesn't. 
Ducks that dive for their feed 
get fish, and the meat will taste fishy. 
Black duck eats snails, 
wild rice, seeds and so forth. 
I like them stuffed and roasted. 
Regular stuffing like you stuff a turkey with -- white bread and 
seasoning. 
You eat it with mashed potatoes, gravy, peas. 
(animal) 
(foodways).

We can use sneakboxes in the wintertime for what we call 
"picking up" clams. 
The water freezes over and stays frozen for 
a couple of weeks at a time and the cold water will bring the 
clams up out of the shallow water. 
The 
ice will melt then and go 
away, and the clam is 
lying right there on the bottom. 
You can 
pick them up by hand or whatever. 
Today you can use the garveys 
for that, but we used to use the sneakboxes and you'd fill the 
thing up with clams, just about as many as you could put on 
it 
in 
one tide. 
The clams are just as good then as anytime. 
But when 
they're cut out -- we call them cutouts -- 
in the ice, they get 
weak, and they can't work theirself back 
in the mud. 
That's how 
we catch them. 
If they're left until that water warms back up, 
they'll get back in the mud. 
The wind and ice cuts them right 
out of the bottom. 
312 
The 
ice moving across the mud takes the mud right off them. 
I've seen them cut out in 
12 feet of water. 
You have to use long 
handled tongs to get them. 
Usually it's 
in shallow water, so we 
get overboard with boots on -- it's very cold. 
We use a rake we 
call a pickup rake for picking up clams -- on a short handle. 
I've seen them out where you can pick them up with your hands 
just as 
fast as you can pick them up. 
Then you put them in a 
basket and take them to the boat which 
is 
in the water, and dump 
them in the boat. 
You buy the rakes -- they're metal. 
Years ago they used to put sails on sneakboxes and would 
sail them around the bay. 
But the kind I build today, I don't 
Thatcher--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 26 
put a sail mast in them. 
My father used to build some with 
masts. 
You can get anywhere from $900—$1000 for one. 
That isn't 
enough to cover my labor. 
But I wouldn't want to pay any more 
than that for one unless I had the money. 
But a lot of these 
hunters will pay anything to get one. 
They buy the oars. 
I 
furnish duck racks, the wind curtain, and the motor bracket. 
The 
duck rack 
is the shelf behind the man, and you keep your decoys 
the re . 
If you cripple a duck, you're not supposed to shoot it under 
power (with your outboard motor running.) 
You're supposed to run 
your boat up to where the duck is, 
shut off the motor, and then 
shoot it. 
It's illegal -- gunning under power. 
You can lay the 
ducks on the duck rack or under the deck. 
The wind curtain can 
also be called the windbreaker. 
It can keep you dry when you're 
running the boat. 
The floorboards in the bottom keep your feet 
dry 
if you get any water in the boat. 
The oar locks are made of 
oak, as are the motor bracket and runners on the bottom, used for 
pulling the boat out on the ice

The only miniatures my brother has made were the sneakboxes, 
and he gave one each to me, my brothers, my sister, and my 
daughter. 
They were Christmas presents. 
He was unemployed the 
same time I was and did 
it for a pastime. 
It's made out of cedar 
and canvas -- the paint makes the canvas stiff. 
I make the 
windspray out of the same stuff. 
My wife makes them by hand on 
the sewing machine. 
I call 
it the windbreak. 
I don't put paint 
or resin on the canvas, though -- 
it has to be folded down.

wife makes the spray curtains.

I'm a member of the Nottingham Hunting and Fishing Club. 
We mainly do deer hunting. 
We have a trap shoot set up, too, at 
Blue Rock. 
We form two sides -- an A Squad and a B Squad. 
We'll 
set up a drive, and one squad will 
be the drivers, and the other 
squad will be your standers. 
We drive this thick piece of woods 
toward the standers. 
We hope the deer will 
go forward, but 
sometimes they'll go back through you. 
We only sort out the 
bucks. 
Next time the standers are the drivers and vice versa. 
This goes on for six days. 
A lot of men can only gun one or two 
days a week. 
If 
it gets too lopsided, we'll regroup, 
'cause 
it 
Thatcher--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 28 
takes so many men to drive a piece of woods. 
We have about 35 
members. 
A driving squad is anywhere from fifteen to seventeen 
men. 
The older men, we won't allow them to go 
in the woods, but 
we put them up so they can hunt and get a shot at a deer. 
This 
club was incorporated in 
1937. 
We have an open membership --
each member can bring in a friend. 
Somebody in the club has to 
know him, then he has to be 
in the club one year to see 
if he's 
going to 
like 
it. 
If he does like 
it and joins, then he's on 
probation for one year. 
If some of the members think he doesn't 
perform safety—wise, or something, then they won't accept his 
membership. 
clubs and organizations. insider/ outsider, G—New 
Gretna; 15GT. 
65 
We have work details, and each member should serve so many 
hours to keep the clubhouse up. 
We go 
in the woods and brush out 
a straight line 
in the woods so we can line up 
in the woods so we 
can see where each man is. 
Very seldom do we have trouble with 
someone not coming to help. 
Usually some guys have legitimate 
excuses. 
Not everyone gets a deer every year. 
One year we killed 17, 
and we had quite a few members that year. 
All the meat is 
divided up. 
Every man can kill two deer during the week. 
You 
kill 
one and take it to the state checking station and they'll 
give you a permit to kill 
the second one. 
Everyone that hunts 
gets some meat. 
We have our hunting patterns that we mainly 
stick to year after year. 
We have about fifteen favorite spots 
and will rotate them. 
100 
We used to take our lunch into the woods, but now we come 
into the clubhouse to eat. 
We have a big supper at night. 
We 
will not allow no drinking during the day whatsoever. 
That's 
club rules. 
Some other clubs have the same rule, but they don't 
stick by 
it. 
In our club 
if any man is found 
in the woods with 
any alcohol on him, he's told to go back to the clubhouse and 
pack his things and go. 
He's kicked out for that particular 
week. 
Most of our members are from Hamilton Square, Trenton. 
We 
have only about ten local fellows in the club. 
They bought a 
piece of ground here and built a clubhouse. 
My brother—in—law 
started gunning with them first, then I joined with him and 
helped him guide. 
Local men might get together on their own and 
gun together day after day, but there's only 8, 
10, 12 guys and 
that's it. 
But around here there's a lot of gunning clubs. 
They 
come from different areas in the state of Jersey except way up 
north -- they have better hunting up there than we have. 
People 
come here from Cape May and Bridgeton, 
like that. 
There's a lot 
of gun clubs 
in Chatsworth. 
They're all from outside the 
community. 
They hang their deer in those little cages in front of the 
clubhouse. 
They were getting their deer stolen in the nighttime, 
so they built the cages and locked them up. 
Every deer club 
likes to hang what they get for show. 
We've been very lucky 
Thatcher--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 29 
haven't had anything stolen. 
Our deer rack 
is out in the open 
and 
is right by one of the exits on the parkway. 
But we've got 
stuff to build a cage around it. 
145 
We take our deer up to a place called Hightstown near 
Trenton for butchering. 
It's all wrapped and marked and frozen. 
Then it's distributed at the first meeting after hunting season. 
They send out cards to all the members that it will be 
distributed that night. 
They have hamburgers, steaks, and chops 
-- a package of each for each man. 
The man that shot the deer 
has his choice of keeping the hide and the head. 
I haven't done 
that. 
I like to keep my memory in my head. 
We hire a cook and two helpers for the week. 
They're men. 
We don't hire no women cooks. 
No other clubs that I know of hire 
women cooks. 
It's a pretty rough gang that particular week, and 
I don't think it'd be a place for a woman. 
We don't advertise 
for a cook, they usually have somebody lined up 
in advance. 
This 
particular cook we have is 
in the fire company up 
in Hamilton 
Square. 
He takes his vacation during that week. 
He gets some 
meat, but he doesn't go hunting at all. 
We used to have some 
cooks that hunted. 
One was a Greek cook and had a restaurant at 
one time. 
We had some fancy eatin'. 
We 
like to have big steaks 
for dinner, or prime rib, and some of them will have a turkey 
dinner. 
It's a good meal. 
Lunch will be hamburgers or 
sandwiches, coffee, milk, cupcakes, something like that. 
(foodways), women, men. 
TX03:193 I have (in my garden) almost 500 poles of pole lima beans. 
You have to put the poles 
in -- that's hard on the arms. 
Those 
are cedar poles. 
But you could use regular 2x2s from the lumber 
yard. 
But the cedar has rough bark that makes it very easy for 
the beans to climb on. 
Yeah,

I have sold to fruit

People freeze them. 
My wife cold packs them a lot. 
I had to 
irrigate this year with a sprinkler to have a good crop. 
My well 
is 23 feet deep and I have a gasoline pump on

Most people will make a meal out of

Or some will cut it off the cob and mix

My wife cooks them with salt pork mainly. 
When I have 
them that's all I want. 
I grow tomatoes too, and my wife canned 
some, made some tomato juice, and she fixed some regular tomato 
sauce. 
But this summer I had some trouble with groundhogs in my 
lima bean crop. 
They ate the whole patch. 
I finally got both 
groundhogs -- I killed them. 
I caught them with a trap --

they're hard to catch out in the open. 
It was a leg hold trap. 
They're trying to outlaw those. 
When they do, I don't know what 
I'll 
do. 
But where I've got them set, nothing else would get in 
them, because it's 
in a briar patch. 
They were alive 
in the 
trap, and then I shot them. 
They destroyed me. 
I was ready to 
throw in, 
but I planted them over again and 
in the meantime, I 
caught the groundhogs.

I grew some string beans -- not on poles, they grow as a 
bunch. 
I had some peas -- they grow on a short vine. 
Also 
cucumbers, but the dry weather killed them. 
My irrigating didn't

I was born here at the nursery 
in 1911. 
Retired and sold 
the nursery a couple of years ago. 
It was originally a farm. 
Nursery started 1921. 
There was a boom period before the 
Depression starting about 1926. 
Dad lost some money during the 
Depression, but survived all 
right. 
(His wife tosses in some 
clarifying comments from off mike as he discusses the period 
before the Depression and after WW I. 
We managed to eat well on 
the farm during the Depression. 
(Airplane goes over.) 
Dad 
started a nursery because there weren't any around. 
Everyone had 
farms. 
5 
(ET asks how landscaping has changed over the years.) 
There 
were no professional 
landscapers early on, 
and there were no 
places to buy the materials. 
They had no help from extension or 
other professionals on landscaping. 
If they liked a plant, they 
planted it where they wanted to. 
Some were good and some were 
haphazard -- 
if they liked it, then I guess it was all 
right. 
The 
boom time caused things to change because then the homeowners had 
money to buy things and hire services. 
This was especially true 
in the cities -- not so much around here. 
(plant), yardscapes. 
(ET asks if there has been an 
increase in 
interest in native 
plants for landscaping.) 
It has changed toward that, but not 
Thatcher--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 32 
greatly. 
Most of that material 
is 
installed by the homeowners 
themselves who like the 
idea of having native material, 
less by 
professional 
landscapers. 
The landscapers that do 
it are 
specialized in that area. 
(ET asks if there 
is a difference between the way old timers 
of the area landscape their yards and the way newcomers from the 
city do 
it.) 
Yes. 
Old timers don't go 
in much for foundation 
planting. 
Usually their landscaping consists of what the lady of 
the house planted that she liked. 
No plan. 
Landscaping now is 
entirely different from what it used to be. 
The main difference 
is the wherewithal people had to do the work, both 
in time and 
money. 
Farmers don't have time to landscape. 
Most landscaping 
in early days was done for estates and large commercial areas. 
10 
(ET comments on communities like Medford Lakes where new 
houses have the trees of the forest right up next to the house.) 
I don't know if Medford was started before the "bulldozer craze" 
or not. 
They used to clear everything out for a development and 
you had to start all over with your trees and landscaping. 
Wooded lots are popular now -- some are overdone and too deep 
into the forest. 
You wonder how they would survive a forest 
fire. 
I don't mean they should take everything out. 
They've 
just left it too raw. 
It would be a catastrophe -- they've been 
lucky so far. 
My 
interest in native plants just developed because I'm 
interested in plants in general. 
If you're really interested in 
flora and fauna, then you're interested 
in all kinds. I've always 
been interested 
in the forest. A long time back I had the 4—H 
forestry club. 
I own some six acres of forest behind our lot, 
and we always had our picnics there. 
We learned about the trees 
and plants of the forest. 
We'd have scavenger hunts for acorns 
and sticks of some kind and leaves of some kind and things like 
that. 
I haven't been officially connected with 4—H for some 
time. 
I retired after 25 years. 
Now, with my grandsons and 
their friends I have a little forestry 4—H club going again. 
They learn to appreciate the natural things that we have and to 
take care of them. 
clubs and organizations. 
15 
Ten or fifteen years ago I tried to promote natural 
materials at the nursery, 
like native azaleas and so forth, but I 
found that I'd have been on a bread line 
if 
I'd kept that up. 
There was no 
interest in 
it at that time. 
People would say, "Oh, 
I can get that out in the woods," which they could, I guess, but 
could they make it grow -- that's another thing. 
A lot of people 
did get native plants in the woods -- especially like red cedar 
and magnolia and ferns. 
Lots of people would make hedges from 
the cedars. 
We had red cedar and swamp cedar -- cypress, really 
-- 
in the nursery, but they didn't do much. 
Now some nurseries 
sell native plants as a specialty, but most nurseries don't. 
I 
think most people would still 
like to buy a yew or something else 
that isn't native. 
Why buy something that's 
in the woods when 
you can landscape with something better, they figure.

I collect some grapevine to make wreaths, and I make 
Christmas ornaments out of different native materials like pine 
cones, acorns, nuts, etc. 
Even weeds. 
I dry some things too, 
but not as much as I did when I had the nursery. 
Now it's a 
hobby and I do 
it for some folks. 
arts and crafts. 
20 
I used to collect moss when we made grave blankets, but not 
now. 
Now we use straw, styrofoam, and other things that are 
easier. 
The people that bought the nursery had a few grave 
blankets out last year, but they don't have the knowledge yet of 
how to do them. 
Their blankets weren't up to what they should 
have been. 
They are amateurs. 
You can't just pick that up 
without having some experience. 
You can see the same sort of 
thing along the highways at Christmas. 
The things look shaggy or 
something, I guess. 
Some of the leading florists like Fishers 
and Mooney 
in Atlantic City are the ones that do the best job on 
grave blankets. 
Some of the florists in Egg Harbor do a nice 
job, too. 
The ones sold at farm markets, I don't like them. 
They're mass produced by inexperienced people, I think. 
There's 
nothing to them -- they have some greens, then they get a laurel 
and spray 
it with silver and put a red ribbon in 
it. 
That's all 
right, but I like a little more to 
it than that. 
Usually they're 
not shaped -- they're scraggly, I don't know. 
Of course, they're 
much cheaper than what a lot of florists would make. 
'Course, 
if 
that suits the people, 
it's all 
right, I guess. 
I'm not too 
crazy about a lot of artificial stuff. 
I don't like that silver 
laurel they put on a lot of them. 
I don't mind a plastic bow, 
and ruscus is OK (Ruscus is a red dyed plant imported mostly from 
Italy). 
I use teasels and cones and different types of weeds

I use sea lavender, which 
is a statice, and we use German 
statice, and we use mullen. 
All 
of these things can be used on a 
grave blanket along with other decorations. 
I just pick up 
whatever . . . . I have some velvet leaf -- it's a weed that 
grows 
in cornfields. 
We don't use the 
leaf, but it's called 
velvet leaf because it has a velvety leaf. 
It has a pod that we 
use. 
Some of those things I use 
in the blankets, and some I use 
in making the ornaments. 
(ET asks if he knows the origin of the practice of making 
grave blankets.) 
My brother used to be a florist, and he did it 
many years ago. 
It was more or less new then -- I'm not sure 
where he picked it up. 
I was rather small then, so it didn't 
bother me too much. 
The first grave blankets were made on 
chicken wire, and greens were woven into 
it. 
It would just cover 
the whole grave, and they would decorate that mat with whatever 
they had -- mostly artificial flowers at that time. 
That's 
thirty—five years ago. 
I don't know where it started. 
There has 
been a trend from artificial to natural things. 
But in business 
offices and doctor's offices and such, they still use a lot of 
artificial things -- like artificial plants. 
But in enclosed 
malls they're using a lot of 
live stuff now, and I think it's 
much nicer.

(ET comments on rural areas where there is 
little concern 
over defining property lines.) 
Hedges have sort of gone out, 
especially in the front. 
There might be a hedge 
in the back 
sometimes along the property line, or a fence. 
I don't think 
property lines are hedged or fenced as much as they used to be. 
I don't know if people are getting friendlier, or 
if they just 
like 
it better. 
I do. 
New developments are using a lot more 
wood fences than they used to. 
They have replaced ornamental or 
plant fences -- hedges. 
It's probably a trend that will come and 
go 
like living fences have. 
Some people have probably gotten 
fouled up with hedges because they didn't stay where they were 
supposed to. 
5 
I don't know how the custom of pruning and shaping your 
shrubs got started, but some people, especially toward Atlantic 
City and Margate, trim the plants like they were turned out in a 
mold, which really isn't proper. 
It is the gardener that does it 
-- not a true landscape man. 
That's OK for topiary work or 
colonial effects, but for present work, shearing should be done 
with a hand shear, not a hedge shear. 
There's one fellow at 
Rutgers (name unintelligible) who has names for different shapes 
that people shape their shrubs into: 
pillboxes, inverted ice 
cream cones, etc. 
Those fellows who teach landscaping at Rutgers 
go 
in for the proper way, which is not to alter the plant from 
it's natural habit of growth, although you can trim it to some 
degree. 
I don't like the way the people who have bought my 
nursery shape the plants that are right here 
in front of my 
house--I wouldn't do 
it 
if 
it were mine, but it's not mine 
anymore. 
They're not experienced nurserymen. 
It's such a big 
change from when I had 
it that I don't even care to go through it 
anymore. 
Now there are more fellows who have taken landscape 
courses, and the New Jersey Nurserymen's Association has 
established Certified Nurserymen.

I'm familiar to some extent with edible plants. 
I don't use 
them myself. 
Some people eat pokeweed sprouts just like you 
would asparagus. 
(Airplane overhead.) 
We don't make wine 
because we don't drink it. 
But we eat mostly out of a garden. 
My wife does a lot of freezing and some canning. 
(Mrs. Liepe 
joins 
in the conversation on the subject of recipes and canning.) 
Mrs.: 
I don't have any special recipes for cranberries and 
blueberries or other things. 
But I always keep some cooked sweet 
potatoes in the fridge during the winter. 
I can always candy 
them. 
Last year was the first time I ever made homemade 
cranberry sauce. 
This isn't the cranberry section right here, 
but someone gave my aunt pounds and pounds of cranberries, and 
she, being crippled, couldn't cook them up, 
so I did. 
Blueberry 
muffins are a specialty with me, and blueberry pie. 
(foodways) 
Mr.: 
We grow tomatoes, beans . . . Mrs.: 
Lima beans and 
string beans, we're starting some asparagus; peas, zucchinis, 
cucumbers. 
We grow string beans that are a bush variety. 
Mrs.: 
The weeds have gotten ahead of us this year partly because of the 
heat, and partly because Carl has been downed with emphysema this 
year.

Mrs.: 
I freeze my tomatoes -- take the skin off and freeze 
them in a bag. 
But you can't let them defrost -- I understand 
they get a wicked smell. 
I just cook them slowly until all 
the 
ice 
is out of them. 
I like 
it because I don't can anything now. 
I do some pickles. 
We have sauerkraut and pork and dumplings 
that are German foods. 
We don't use many spices, and we don't do 
Italian foods or other tomato foods except cooked tomatoes plain. 
Mr.: 
We take care of the garden equally between us. 
Mrs.: 
I like to pick. 
I freeze strawberries. 
We give away the 
blackberries and they give us jelly back.

I can what we raise on a farm. 
I don't really buy anything. 
My brothers or friends raise it on their farms. 
We can or freeze 
everything: 
peppers, tomatoes, peaches, pears, jelly, eggplant, 
corn we freeze, etc. 
This year everything was expensive, but we 
did all 
right. 
I use pineapple when I put up pears, and 
sometimes I also add maraschino cherries so I almost have a fruit 
cocktail, but I don't buy much else. 
I make a sugar syrup, and I 
use crushed pineapple, and I dice the pears, and I put some 
cherries in for coloring. 
Then when I make a fruit salad, I use 
that and add whatever else I want. 
I put up my own peaches, so I 
put them in. 
Sometimes if white seedless grapes are cheap, I'll 
put them in the jars with the pears, too. 
I chop the cherries. 
I don't put a dressing on the fruit salad -- we don't go for 
stuff like that. 
Sometimes I can plums. 
(Interruption for 
lighting adjustment. 
Mrs. Paolino goes off mike and returns.) 
(foodways), gardens. 
I can tomatoes and put celery and carrots in 
it, 
then it's 
ready for a stew or soup. 
It's nice since we 
live 
in the country 
and sometimes prices are so high, too. 
I saute my onion, then I 
throw that in, 
and I've got the vegetables, and I add potatoes 
and meat. 
Sometimes I do the same thing with a tomato puree. 
I 
put it into the jars about 20 minutes before it's ready to eat. 
That way, when you open the jars, 
it's a little on the hard side, 
Thatcher--83 
Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 42 
and you cook 
it and it's just right. 
I also do string beans by 
letting the tomato puree come to a 
boil, I wash the beans and let them cook 
in the tomato, and when 
they're almost ready, I put them in the jar. 
The jar stays hot 
for a few minutes, and they cook a little more. 
We eat them 
plain as a vegetable, or put them into a stew. 
5 
I also make pickled sweet peppers, bread and butter pickles, 
pickled eggplant. 
Bread and butter pickles: 
You put vinegar, 
water and sugar and mustard seed, celery seed, and turmeric with 
cucumbers and onions. 
(She goes off mike.) I don't cold pack 
anything. 
(She brings a jar of bread and butter pickles from the 
refrigerator and gives the fieldworkers samples.) 
I use peanut 
butter jars to can 
in. 
They have this little rubber around the 
inside so you can use them. 
The pickles are hot when you put 
them in the jars, so the lids go right down and seal. 
(She goes 
off mike again and returns with a plastic bag containing 
turmeric, celery seed and the pickle recipe, stored all 
together 
so they are at her fingertips when she 
is ready to make the 
pickles.) 
I'm not the type that keeps recipes to myself. 
We raise our own basil, and I wash it nice and clean and 
leave 
it to blot dry overnight, then I put it 
in the freezer in 
bags. 
I used to wrap it up 
in 
little pieces of tin foil, but I 
figured I was wasting a lot of tin foil. 
This works better. 
I 
use 
it 
in salads, chicken, tomato sauce, gravies, etc. --
anything. 
This is parsley that I do the same thing with. 
I wash 
it and put it 
into the blender, and then let 
it drain in my 
macaroni colander, then I put it on a cookie sheet and freeze it 
then put it into a bag. 
I can get a hunk and put it 
into 
meatballs or whatever I'm making. 
10 
I have a big freezer (upright) down 
in the basement. 
This 
one (on top of the refrigerator) 
is full, and the one downstairs 
is full, too. 
I put up broccoli, corn, and anything I can put my 
hands on. 
(She goes off mike.) 
People give it to me. 
If I 
can't use 
it then I give it to somebody. 
Here's some frozen 
strawberry jam that I make. 
It's not cooked -- the recipe 
is on 
the Sure—Jell box. 
Years ago we used to make jelly, measure two 
cups of sugar, one cup of juice -- now this 
is the easiest way to 
do 
it. 
The other day I fried eggplant and put it 
in the freezer 
-- I sliced the eggplant, dipped it 
in egg and bread crumbs, then 
I fry it and pack 
it 
in wax paper first on those styrofoam dishes 
(meat trays from the market), then put foil over them. 
Then it's 
ready for eggplant parmigiana when I make the sauce. 
I can take 
as many slices as I need because they're separated by wax paper. 
Then 
it goes right in the oven without having to thaw out. 
We 
make those ideas up because you have to do something when you 
have too much left over. 
See, I make meatballs and freeze them, 
too. 
(Off mike.) 
I made up my own recipe for meatballs. 
I have 
one recipe for three pounds of meat, and one for fifteen pounds 
because we have these dinners. 
I made a recipe where I measured 
Thatcher--83 
Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 43 
everything to my own taste. 
I make my own pizza dough: 
4 C. warm water, 2 yeast cakes, 
salt and pepper to taste, 10 C. flour. 
Here's my meatballs 
recipe: 
15 lbs. meat, 1 C. parsley, 60 slices of stale bread 
(the older the bread is, 
the nicer it crumbles up), 30 eggs (one 
per pound), 15-18 cloves of garlic, 4 C. cheese, 1/2 C. 
salt, 1/8 
C. 
pepper. 
They make the nicest meatballs -- you've eaten them 
over at Toni's Custard. 
Can't go wrong. 
My mother, God rest her soul, used to make roast peppers 
under the grill 
in the oven and take off the skin, then put them 
in a jar without salt or anything. 
That's the only thing I make 
cold pack. 
But I don't have a cold pack canner -- I just put 
them in a pot with water and I stick a lot of newspapers in 
between the jars, and they have to boil for twenty minutes. 
You 
have to pack them very loosely, up to two inches from the top of 
the jar. 
They're bell peppers -- thick ones. 
You can use a 
green, too, but red ones have a sweeter taste. 
15 
I put them under the broiler on a cookie sheet for about 
fifteen minutes, then turn them a couple of times, then I put 
them in a pot with a lid and they steam to 
loosen any spots that 
haven't come loose yet. 
Leave them an hour or so while you do 
your work or something. 
Eleven o'clock at night I'm here 
watching TV, and I clean them and put them in the plastic freezer 
bags or put them in jars. 
Jars are nice because they don't have 
to be thawed out. 
Then when you take them out you can put some 
basil, parsley, garlic, oregano, oil, and salt on them and you 
fix them up 
in a salad. 
They're big for antipasto, and stuffed 
flounder with crab meat where they call for pimientos. 
They're 
the same thing as roast peppers. 
You can make them into 
sandwiches. 
I just eat them without the bread. 
But what's good 
is bread soaked 
in the oil at the bottom. 
I also make pickled eggplants. 
You slice the eggplant and 
salt it down for about an hour or two, then you squeeze all 
the 
salt out. 
Then you mix a half and half solution of white vinegar 
and water, and let 
it come to a boil, then pour it over the 
eggplants and 
leave them until they're cool enough to handle --
maybe and hour or so. 
Then I squeeze them again as hard as I 
can. 
Then I put them in a big pan. 
At the same time I slice up 
celery and green peppers and put a half and half vinegar and 
water solution on them and let them stay as 
long as the 
eggplants. 
Then you drain them and put them together with the 
eggplant with chopped garlic, oregano, a little salt, and oil, 
and a little light pepper, then you mix them up and put in 
the 
jars. 
You can serve that as an antipasto alone or 
in a lazy 
susan with little dishes of pickles and olives and 
other things. 
That's good for a lunch with a bunch of ladies. 
20 
Lots of people make antipasto with salami, cheese, 
anchovies, roast peppers, and they put olive oil 
on 
it. 
Thatcher--83 
Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 44 
Artichokes can go 
in too. 
When we have a party we have almost 
everything we put up: 
pickles, eggplant, sweet peppers. 
When I 
pickle sweet peppers I cut them up and make a solution of sugar, 
water and vinegar, and let it come to a boil. 
Then after I fill 
up my jars I pour this hot solution over the peppers. 
You also 
add salt: 
for a quart, 1 tsp., and for a pint, 1/2 tsp. 
Then 
you seal them. 
They're as crisp as can be. 
The only thing we 
buy 
is olives if we feel 
like having them. 
I peel eggplant because it looks nice and white--I don't 
think you have to peel 
it, though. 
My brothers used to raise 
eggplant, but now they only raise sweet potatoes and cucumbers. 
My friends up the street have eggplant. 
My sister just brought 
me some peppers. 
With all my family and friends, I have 
everything we need. 
I showed my brother's wife how to make 
pickles in return for the cucumbers, and we make some for her. 
They're not working fools like us. 
I was brought up that way by 
my mother -- she used to do 
it. 
Even when I don't feel good, I 
work. 
I don't lose my way of doing things. 
I like my daughter— 
in—law because she likes to do things like I do. 
We do eggplants 
or pickles or applesauce. 
For them we put 1 C. 
of sugar in a big 
pot of Delicious apples for them. 
But for my husband and me we 
don't put sugar at all. 
(She 
is diabetic.) 
25 
We used to make sausage when my mother was living -- we used 
to kill our own pigs. 
And we used to cook down our own lard. 
The younger generation doesn't want to be bothered. 
If I had to 
do 
it today, I'd know how. 
I don't know how to kill 
the pig, but 
I know how to cut it up 
into pork chops and all. 
I know how to 
kill a chicken, too. 
All the women my age know how to do that, 
but not the young generation.

At one time in my mother's house, when my husband had died 
and my sister had died, there were eighteen of us there. 
I used 
to cook and clean for everyone. 
I went back home after my 
husband died. 
The oldest was eight years old and the youngest 
was eight months old -- there were five sisters. 
Then my baby 
was born, and my mother took care of the two babies. 
I worked 
hard. 
Then my brother—in—law remarried after 26 months, but the 
baby wouldn't go with the father and we raised her. 
My mother 
died when the baby was fourteen, and she still wouldn't go with 
her father. 
My brothers and my father and all of us saw her go 
through high school, and she got married through us. 
She's more 
or less like another sister. 
She always calls me when she wants 
to know how to do anything. 
We all 
live close to each other. 
When we decide we're going to have a party and it's just family, 
we're about 78 people. 
You can't invite everybody. 
But we all 
stick together. 
We haven't got too many relatives left. 
Some 
didn't even come from Italy. 
My father married my mother when he was thirty -- he was 
fifteen years older than my mother. 
I guess he came to America 
when he was about fifteen/ sixteen. 
I was born 
in 1915. 
My 
mother wasn't even a lady when she got married -- that's why she 
stayed two years without having a baby. 
They were married in 
1907, and my sister Pauline was born in 1909. 
I had a nice— 
Thatcher--83 
Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 46 
looking mother and father. 
When my father first had Puerto Ricans come down to their 
farm, their food smelled so good. 
One day they were making pork 
and beans, bacon and rice 
and hot dogs. 
I cooked it for my kids 
and they loved it. 
So when they got married, they told their 
wives they wanted their "Puerto Rican dinner," so my daughter—in— 
law called and asked what Louis wanted. 
I said "Oh, Mary Ann. 
My doggone kid. 
It's only hot dogs, pork and beans and bacon." 
He 
loves it, and my other son did the same thing. 
And they 
always loved pot roast better than nicer cuts of beef. 
I just 
put salt and pepper and flour to brown it, 
then add a little 
water and put carrots, celery and potatoes all around it. 
Sometimes I'll 
buy a nice pot roast for my kids' wives to cook, 
then they call me up and say, 
"Oh, that chuck roast was so good." 
I usually serve corn and a salad with it. 
And I always like 
cranberry sauce with everything. 
(foodways) 
5 
(She goes off mike to get a bottle of homemade cranberry 
sauce for the interviewers to sample.) 
I cook the cranberries 
2 cups of berries and 1 cup of sugar. 
I'll 
let 
it come back to a 
boil and 
it jells. 
My niece gives them to me. 
They work for 
this farmer up near Chatsworth. 
She gives them to me because she 
doesn't want to be bothered, so I make it and give her some back. 
I don't do too much baking. 
My husband won't eat anything that's 
fattening, and I shouldn't have it because I'm diabetic. 
If I do 
bake, I like simple recipes without icing. 
I like raw apple cake 
and Dr. Bird cake (with bananas and pineapple). 
If we have a 
charity spaghetti dinner or something, I always volunteer to make 
cupcakes. 
I'm always fighting myself because they never come 
out all 
one size. 
But I make the prettiest cupcakes because I 
peak the icing and put a lot of jimmies on top. 
Everyone fights 
for my cupcakes. 
I get so mad -- I measure each spoon, and they 
never come out the same size. 
I'm fussy. 
I make my meatballs all 
the same size, too. 
I 
can feel 
if there's that extra little tiny bit as I roll them 
between my hands. 
People laugh at me because of that. 
If they 
go to someone's house to eat, and the hostess tries to say she 
made the meatballs, they always say, "You didn't make them. 
Aunt 
Clara was here." 
They all know that, because I have to make them 
all 
one size. 
I've heard of the San Sostine Society, but we're members of 
St. Lucy's church here 
in Blue Anchor. 
They're having a 
spaghetti dinner Oct. 22. 
It starts at twelve o'clock after a 
mass in the morning at 11 o'clock. 
It's 
in the basement of the 
church. 
10 
I don't make too much special at Christmas, but for Easter 
we make sweet pies and ham pies, and a lot of cookies. 
Sweet 
pies are made with ricotta cheese. 
Ham pies -- I buy boiled ham 
and dice it in nice little pieces.

You eat them with tea or coffee -- as a

You can out these cookies in different shapes -- like Santa Claus 
and bells for Christmas. 
It's a real nice recipe for the 
holidays. 
Christmas Eve 
is our big thing. 
Even though they say you 
can eat meat now -- they're not as strict, we still go old— 
fashioned. 
We have fish: 
smelts (sp?), macaroni with anchovies 
in white (sauce) with garlic, stuffed flounder -- everything in 
the fish line. 
To me that's the big thing for Christmas Eve. 
We 
look for our Christmas Eve and our Good Friday. 
We also stick to 
fish on Good Friday -- we would never eat meat on Good Friday. 
15 
They all meet here at my house -- my two brothers and my two 
sons. 
We all 
eat here, and after we straighten up, then we have 
fruit and nuts and we open our gifts here. 
Sometimes we have a 
Santa Claus come in for the kids. 
I don't care what we do on 
Christmas Day. 
I like Christmas Eve, Easter, Good Friday, and I 
enjoy my Thanksgiving. 
It's the first holiday that the family's 
all 
together. 
The kids all 
go to football games, and I stay home 
and cook. 
I make the Italian soup with endive and little 
meatballs or chicken soup over crepes with cheese on top. 
Holidays give you the blues. 
I lost my sister two days 
before Christmas. 
I lost my husband two weeks on the day after 
she died. 
My mother died on Easter. 
My sister Pauline's husband 
died on the 29th of March. 
My mother died on the 30th. 
It was 
Holy Week and we couldn't bury them that week, and we had to keep 
them all 
that time. 
We have one wake until about ten o'clock at the funeral 
parlor. 
They used to have them in the home. 
My mother and my 
husband were laid out at home. 
But my father was laid out at the 
undertaker's. 
Our friends come in and bring food. 
You're never 
left alone. 
They relieve the family from all 
responsibility. 
I 
lost a nephew at Easter. 
Those days -- they're all marked. 
20 
I put up plums, peaches and pears. 
Those are the only 
fruits. 
And I make grape, raspberry and strawberry preserves. 
We don't make wine. 
I made cherry brandy last year. 
(She gets 
the brandy and gives samples.) 
I used two lbs. of sugar, a quart 
and a half of wild cherries, and the rest was vodka. 
We don't 
drink, but we just made it. 
(Activity relating to picture—taking 
and going downstairs to see the pantry.)

(They all 
give their names and birth dates.) B: 
Most fire 
companies are pretty much alike. 
Egg Harbor has more action, and 
is semi—professional. 
It's a community effort. 
The women and 
children participate, and we have a large percentage of the 
community. 
Warren: 
We invite people to join. 
If they work out they stay 
forever. 
Barry: 
They have to qualify on the equipment in the first thirty 
days and pay their dues. 
You have to requalify annually. 
I'm 
the training officer. 
We also require a minimum of other 
participation -- fund raising, work days, business meetings, etc. 
Dues are $3.00 a year, and they mostly go for the monthly flier. 
We put people's anniversaries of when they joined the company 
into the flier. 
That way everyone's name is 
in at least once a 
year. 
We also announce work days and other events. 
5 
Warren: 
Some guys you see three times a year, and some you 
see 75 times a year. 
Minimum requirements are 4 activities a 
year, requalification, and all fires. 
Barry: 
We have training available in Mt. Holly through the 
county, but it's so far away that most of us can't make it 
in 
time. 
So we use the Atlantic Co. training, which is 
inferior to 
the Burlington Co. 
Thatcher--83 
Reel—to—reel logs 
page 50 
Eileen: 
I'm qualified on the equipment, and am a member of the 
company, not the auxiliary. 
There are four women in the company 
now 
(Homiller's daughter comes in. 
She's married to a cranberry 
farmer.) 
Barry: 
Eileen has not only been a firefighter, but has been a 
line officer -- one of the leaders on the fire ground. 
Eileen: 
The women joined because the men are gone to work during 
the day. 
We don't have anything about women's lib or anything. 
The women make more fires than the men because we're around. 
One 
girl 
is single, the rest of us are also married to firefighters. 
10 
Barry: 
Joining the company -- fill out application, be 
interviewed, meet the requirements, be voted on at the next 
meeting. 
We've never turned anyone down. 
We don't have a 
waiting list like some companies do. 
Fire school 
is not 
mandatory, but we have training once a month here. 
We train on 
different types of equipment. 
Warren: Airpacks are one thing we have to learn to use. 
Barry: 
If someone doesn't respond to the firehouse within three 
minutes of the call, the siren blows a second time. 
It's very 
rare that the siren blows a second time. 
I think at night 
sometimes they let 
it go five minutes. 
Eileen: 
Our siren just blows four full blasts of the siren. 
Some places use specific blasts to mean specific things. 
15 
Eileen and Warren: 
There are probably more forest fires 
than house fires. 
We only go out on forest fires if we're 
requested to. 
We protect buildings while the forest service 
fights the fire itself. 
We remember the fire when four men died 
in 
1977 or 78. 
Forest fire 
is very scary. 
Warren: 
I don't find it any more scary than a building fire. 
Barry: 
I'm kind of scared of both. 
Warren: 
We don't feel fear as we go out, but when we get there 
and see the situation, we might feel a little fear. 
Eileen: 
It's not exactly fear -- you're very busy. 
But in a 
small town it's always someone you know. 
Barry: 
My biggest fear is that someone will be hurt. 
20 
There aren't any jokes, as such, but we do talk about the 
fires and tell funny anecdotes that have happened. 
Eileen: 
I 
think jokes surface more when you're dealing with people more 
than just with the fire. 
When I was in the ambulance company we 
tended to tell funny stories about the people. 
Barry: 
Eileen's brother and his uncle almost fried once when his 
uncle dropped him off with a pump and then came back for him just 
in the nick of time. 
Eileen: 
One of the guys drove the fire truck into a cesspool 
once. 
Barry: 
He's done 
it twice. 
He's got a homing device on 
his truck. 
25 
We don't go off the paved highway since those four men were 
killed. 
The forest service 
is very strict about that. 
Thatcher--83 
Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 51 
Eileen: 
Once some guys went on the right road in the wrong town. 
And then there are the calls when there isn't anything. 
One lady 
was so embarrassed when she called us, 
so we wrote it down as 
wiring. 
Warren: 
We wish everyone who has a chimney fire would call 
us. 
They can spread to the rest of the house. 
Eileen: 
(after phone rings) 
My girlfriend and I have started a 
little newspaper for the township called the Whispering Pine. 
We 
announce different community activities. 
30 
(Interviewer asks some questions about companies that become 
more social 
in nature.) 
Eileen: 
Our company 
is very unified. 
Everyone pulls together. 
Warren: 
We do 
lots of fund raising when we need a new truck. 
We 
get only $7500 in tax support. 
Everything else 
is gotten through 
fundraising activities. 
We have the suppers, or sell hoagies, or 
something.

Cabbage and potatoes for the (fire company) dinners 
is bought from local farmers.

We do well because 
everyone is assigned to do certain things. 
My mother has made 
the coconut custard pie every year. 
They make the pies on 
Thursday at the firehouse. 
Barry: 
The organization didn't happen overnight. 
After every 
supper, we got together and talked over how it could be 
improved. 
5 
Eileen: 
The only supper I've ever missed was when I was in 
the hospital having my son, and now he's 21 years old. 
The kids 
start asking when they're nine, "When can I work on the supper?" 
Every kid 
in town works on 
it, whether their parents are 
in the 
company or not. 
They got about $12 each this time. 
They get 
money if they're under 18. 
Then they do 
it for free. 
They 
usually stop for a couple of years when they get to be about 17, 
but when they settle down, they always come back.

Warren and Eileen: 
Our son wanted to join the junior company 
when he was 16. 
We helped start the junior company. 
They get 
the training, and they go on fires, but they're not allowed in 
any dangerous situation. 
Barry: 
Even at age 16, 
they have the same vote as the chief. 
It's a lot of responsibility. 
Eileen: 
It binds the generations together. 
My son was on the 
same truck as his grandfather. 
Almost everyone in the company is 
related to us. 
Some people say we're a clique, but we welcome 
others. 
Barry: 
There are lots of people 
in that so—called clique that 
aren't family members. 
10 
Eileen: 
We don't have too many people moving in because of 
the building moratorium. 
Barry: 
When somebody new comes in, we start dropping by and 
leaving subtle hints about joining the fire company. 
Warren and Eileen: 
You have to be able to put the fire company 
first -- even 
if you have to get up and leave company at the 
dinner table. 
The people who are involved in the PTA, the 
church, and the fire company tend to be the same people. 
Eileen: 
I teach a class 
in Jenkins, and they're sort of a satellite of 
our church. 
They don't have a church, so we're trying to draw 
them in. 
They're really the piney people -- they don't get 
involved with what the rest of the community does. 
They don't 
have a fire company there. 
If there's a fire 
in that area, 
Chatsworth, Green Bank and Lower Bank might be called. 
The 
dispatcher knows exactly which fire company to call for a given 
fire. 
15 
Barry: 
There's a hierarchy of ten companies for every 
location. 
Warren: 
We have to be able to do everything -- including put the 
places back together after the fire is over. 
We cover up the 
holes in the roof, and so forth so that the property is 
protected. 
We cover things with tarps to protect them from water 
coming through the roof. 
Not every company does those things. 
Warren: 
It's the Pinelands Commission's fault that houses have 
to be built so far back from the road, and they have to leave 
trees up -- they can't be protected from fire. 
Barry: 
They want you to 
leave the brush right up to your door. 
That's the most dangerous thing of all. 
Most people who know 
anything just ignore that rule. 
Eileen: 
My father always used to burn the fields in the spring 
to protect from forest fire. 
Now it's illegal because of the 
EPA. 
A forest fire will put up a lot more smoke that stays for a 
long time than a ten—minute controlled burn will. 
Warren: 
We have a tree here and a tree there and a few bushes up 
around our house, but they're all 
green -- they won't burn 
easily.

Any large piece of ground is good, because if you can't get

The natives, whether they're in the company or not, are fire 
conscious. 
Eileen: 
We go to the school and educate the kids, who then talk 
to their parents. 
I used to be 
in the ambulance company for 12 years. 
It's 
mostly women. 
The men are in the fire company. 
I finally got 
out of the ambulance company to be 
in the fire company -- you 
have to make up your mind what you want to commit to. 
Warren: 
I was 
in both companies once, too, and 
it was horrible. 
I was on the school board, captain of the ambulance company, and 
chief of the fire company. 
Barry: 
Lots of 
local people are like that. 
My parents are that 
involved at the moment. 
I'm assistant chief of the fire company, 
secretary of the fire company, and on the school board. 
Everyone 
wears a lot of hats. 
25 
The chief is responsible for the fire ground and training, 
and the president of the fire company is responsible for meetings 
and business matters. 
The terms are one year, but you can be re— 
elected over and over. 
Warren: 
Local fire chiefs get together and talk about problems. 
The county does 
it, 
too, but the problems at the north end of the 
county don't concern us. 
They're big city firemen, so we don't 
get together with them too much.

Eileen and Barry: 
None of the firemen are unemployed, but 
there are unemployed people here, 
like everywhere. 
More and more 
women are working outside the home. 
Warren works 
in 
Philadelphia.

With family gardens, I think the wife is the one

Barry: 
I'm an appeals examiner and travel around a lot.

I always wondered why the Lord made the harvest and the heat all 
together, and the canning season!

I guess the people put rocks or cinder blocks along the

Yeah, they always knock over those urns we have out at

We plant spring flowers in them. 
The

Eileen: 
I do all

So does Barry's wife. 
The

It's partly because of the

We also have 
lots of good bakers.

paper towels and newspapers. 
We just throw it in the middle of

He's probably related

Christmas dinner is usually ham and turkey with 
stuffing and cranberry sauce and sweet potatoes, creamed onions,

Last year the fire ladies had a cookie sale -- or maybe it 
was the church. 
That was a new thing, but I hope we do 
it again.

We used to make tea out of teaberries for the kids.

The other day 
I saw a covey of quail--little tiny ones, and a squirrel.

He never bothers the

We have chickens, too, and the birds come

Eileen: 
We don't butcher the chickens, though, because I don't 
have the heart for it. 
I just keep the hens for the eggs, and 
give the roosters to a woman in Jenkins.

Our community came here in 1962 from Philadelphia. 
We 
wanted to set up a community of black Jews to provide a better 
way of life and to prepare for going to Israel. 
But we have 
decided not to go to Israel. 
We chose this area because it was 
close to Philadelphia, but also our chances of getting cheap land 
here were better than in western Pennsylvania. Judaism is a way 
of 
life and your environment has an 
influence on your 
personality. 
We felt we should be more or less to ourselves --
our own community, and New Jersey provided the best opportunity 
for that. 
Also, the state of NJ has a history of being liberal 
or unbiased in religion. 
We've never had trouble with the Klan 
or anything. 
We were all converted -- the story is 
long: 
My father said we were Jewish -- my feeling is that we are 
from the Sephardic Jews of Spain. 
My father said our identity 
was not Negro or Christian. 
We were forbidden a long time ago to 
practice our religion. 
I didn't really feel Jewish just from 
that. 
My mother's family also believed that they were Jewish and 
tried to keep some Jewish principles like keeping Kosher. 
Fifty 
years ago and claiming that you were black and Jewish was pretty 
unusual. 
Not much was known about Sephardic Jews at that time. 
5 
Two things brought me to the study and practice of 
Judaism. 
At the age of 13 I was playing 
in the streets of north 
Philadelphia and I was struck by 
lightening. 
My father, my 
grandmother and my uncle witnessed it. 
I wasn't knocked down or 
Thatcher--83 Reel-to-reel 
logs 
page 61 
injured, and there was no smell of smoke. 
To the witnesses I 
appeared to be burning from the legs up. 
I was immobilized, and 
to me 
it was a bright light around me. 
Our white neighbor lady 
fainted. 
At the time I didn't understand what happened, but now 
I understand that it was a divine sign from heaven that I had 
been chosen for a purpose. 
supernatural. 
In 1948, when I was 28, I was lying on my bed 
in a semi— 
asleep state. 
I heard a voice whisper "Seek God." 
It frightened 
me -- no one was in the room except my wife and I. 
First I 
covered my head with the blanket, and then I couldn't move it 
off. 
There was some kind of force, 
like the pressure of wind, 
holding the blanket down. 
Then I heard the sound of a rushing 
wind leave my bedroom. 
I think there was a divine presence in my 
room. 
Then I began to have dreams. 
Once I saw two creatures with 
human bodies, but with their heads covered. 
They 
didn't have 
any color in their faces -- only light. 
One was speaking to me 
in a language I couldn't understand, but he had a stern look, 
commanding me to do something. 
I agreed, but I didn't know what 
it was he wanted. 
10 
The other creature was standing on a raised platform 
and he came and talked to me. 
We were standing in a garden, and 
we saw a fiery sword -- I assumed it was the entrance to the 
Garden of Eden. 
The next dream, I saw a huge Bible 
in heaven and heard a 
loud voice saying, "Every word that is written in this book 
is 
true and shall be fulfilled." 
Finally it came back to me what my 
father had said, that we were Jewish, and that was the religion 
to follow. 
Then I had another dream of a bookstore, and I saw books 
with writing I couldn't understand -- now I know it was Hebrew --
and there were artifacts that we use 
in the Jewish religion. 
One 
day I was 
in a white Jewish neighborhood around 7th and Poplar, 
and I found the store that I had seen 
in my dream. 
I was 
shocked. 
I went in, 
and I told the woman my story, and that I 
wanted to 
learn something about my religion. 
She sold me two 
books -- the two most important books to the Jewish people: 
One 
was the five books of Moses. 
It had English on one side of the 
page and Hebrew on the other. 
The other book was the Siddur 
(sp?), or prayer book. 
As I read them, I would go back and get 
more books on Jewish history and what not. 
I read about 
Passover, so I got books on how to observe Seder in Hebrew. 
15 
The lady gave me the address of a Hebrew teacher, but 
he said he couldn't teach me. 
So I went back to the bookstore 
and asked for a book to 
learn Hebrew -- I had confidence in my 
scholastic abilities. 
The lady gave me an old copy of First 
Knowledge. 
I took 
it home, and it was like Greek to me. 
I

fasted and prayed and asked for help. 
I began to study, and now 
I can read 
it. 
(He shows the interviewer a book 
in Hebrew that 
prepares people to read the Torah.) 
I bought more books on 
syntax, vocabulary, and everything. 
I was able to converse with 
Israelis in Israel. 
It was a divine revelation to me. 
My 
personal experience is that there is a God. 
Then I bought books on Talmudic law -- 
it 
is very difficult 
to understand. 
I also studied Jewish history. 
It's been 
constant study for me -- I will be studying for the rest of my 
I 
if e. 
20 
We started off with an orthodox stance. 
But it 
is 
difficult to conform to. 
Jewish law indicates a stance for 
moderation. 
We are not to lean toward hedonism, or to strict 
austerity. 
Orthodox Judaic practices are often very austere. 
We 
consider ourselves liberal orthodox or conservative -- we are not 
extreme. 
We are living 
in American society, and we are affected 
by change. 
We don't have any input into the mainstream Judaism 
-- there are no black rabbis in the Kosherut (sp?). 
The economic system in Israel 
is 
so bad that they are 
considering adopting the American dollar, and the American 
economic lifestyle is moving into Israel. 
So we are middle of 
the road Jews. 
The Messiah will be a human being. 
At one time, I thought 
this might be my own calling. 
I don't see traditional Judaism as 
moving forward. 
God was angry with the Jews 
in the Bible, and 
traditional Judaism is 
the same as they had. 
Maybe my family 
will have something to do with it. 
I used to think that it would 
only be for black people, but now I think it 
is for everyone. 
Judaism will constitute the salvation of the world -- a 
modification of the interpretation of traditional orthodox 
doctrines that would ordinarily alienate Gentiles. 
25 
Black people are offspring of the Jews because they

To be a great people, you 
must learn what it feels like to be a small or persecuted people.

I don't agree with the civil rights leaders who accuse 
America of being a land of oppression -- true, 
it was a land of 
oppression, but it was for a purpose. 
God has something great for 
the black people -- we must find out our identity. 
I took the 
course of bringing to the black people an identity as Jews, not 
based on color, but on history, beliefs and customs. 
The white 
race doesn't owe us anything except to acknowledge our identity. 
I drew my own conclusions about our origins. 
The Jews were 
expelled from Spain 
in 1492. 
Their wealth (confiscated) financed 
Columbus's voyage. 
They were expelled and took passage on boats 
to Holland and ultimately Brazil. 
But those that could not get 
passage on those boats went to northern Africa, across the 
straits of Gibraltar. 
We 
lived in the open fields 
in northwest 
Africa and ate grass. 
White Jews don't relate to this -- only 
colored Jews do. 
Avaricious sea captains promised that they 
would take these people to a land of haven and they instead sold 
them as slaves. 
This is the only way that I can say we got here. 
Not all 
black people here are Jews, but there are some. 
They 
weren't permitted to practice their religion, and they ultimately 
forgot it. 
5 
Even with the discrimination in the U.S., 
it has been a 
blessing and part of the divine plan for us to come to this 
country. 
It's the best country in the world -- even better than 
Israel at this point in history. 
I've experienced 
Thatcher--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 64 
discrimination, but I don't hold a grudge. 
Especially against 
the younger generation. 
We were punished because we had 
disobeyed God's laws. 
Some of the founding fathers wanted Hebrew to be the 
language of this country. 
I came across that in a newspaper. 
I 
don't hate anybody. 
Here I am, the offspring of a persecuted 
people, and today I've built something -- I'm an asset to the 
community. 
I'm respected by my white neighbors. 
But I don't go 
out and seek converts in the white race, although the religion 
has something to offer everybody. 
My ancestors really didn't get 
the message. 
God can only express himself through people. 
There's a bit of God 
in everyone. 
The very same people who are 
accused of being prejudiced against black people -- last year, a 
whole neighborhood got together to help a little black boy get 
rescued from a well. 
I look at things like that and weigh them 
against the bad things. 
Some people are mixed up. 
Judaism has 
afforded me the opportunity to treat all people equally and 
overcome prejudices. 
religion, ethnicity. 
I designed our synagogue and had a builder build it. 
We did 
all 
the interior improvements, just as I did here 
in this house. 
This room we are in was a garage. 
I'm a self—taught man in 
everything--gardening, building, and everything. 
architecture. 
10 
The synagogue is shaped in the form of an "L," and 
in 
Hebrew, the word "El" means "God." 
Our services are conducted 
entirely in Hebrew. 
We conduct them from the orthodox Hebrew 
prayer book. 
Everyone has a prayer book, with both English and 
Hebrew written in 
it so everyone can follow along. 
Our main 
services are on Friday evenings (prayer services) and Saturday 
mornings. 
We have a choir with male and female voices which 
sings 
in Hebrew. 
This adds depth to the services. 
Female voices 
are unusual for an orthodox service. 
Saturday morning services 
are more extensive. 
Prayers are 
in 
lieu of the sacrifices on the 
altar in ancient times -- they had double sacrifices on the 
Sabbath, and so we have an extended prayer service on the 
Sabbath. 
We also read a portion (Sidra) from the scroll of the 
law. 
You're welcome to attend one of our services. 
We separate 
the males from the females -- that's why we're liberal orthodox 
and not conservative -- we don't give up the orthodox ideals 
completely. 
Women sit 
in the back of the synagogue and the men 
in 
the front. 
This 
is so the worshipper can concentrate on the 
service. 
It's natural for the sexes to be attracted to each 
other, and 
it would be a distraction from worship. 
We have no 
prejudices against females. 
We have also relaxed our orthodox 
stance in that we call women to say the blessing on the Torah. 
15 
If any white Jews come to the services, we invite them 
to participate according to their lineage -- we believe them, 
whatever they say. 
They might say they are Cohen or Levi, or 
whatever. 
We have fewer visitors now than we did when we were 
new, and the press was interested in us. 
We used to have a dance 
Thatcher--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 65 
and instrumental group. 
I do cantorial work. 
We used to perform 
for a lot of Jewish communities throughout the region -- even to 
Toronto. 
Things have died down now, with the cost of 
living and 
everything. 
We did our own choreography on authentic Israeli 
songs and dances. 
Our congregation is mostly this community plus a couple of 
people from Philadelphia. 
Our membership has dropped off. 
Judaism was not their thing. 
I had a radio program in Philly, 
and all 
of the people here in the community are people I met 
after I became involved in this. 
Even my sisters have not joined 
us. 
20 
When I grew up, 
it was 
in an 
integrated, predominantly 
white neighborhood. 
But as I grew older, the neighborhood became 
mostly black. 
I became more a victim of prejudice from the time 
I was fourteen on. 
It was very difficult for a black student to 
get a scholarship. 
I was a bookworm. 
I told a teacher I wanted 
to be a civil engineer, and the teacher asked me to stay after 
school. 
I really believed all this stuff about Ben Franklin and 
America is the land of the free and the home of the brave. 
I had 
no reason to believe that I was black -- I wasn't from down 
south. 
The teacher said, "Are you aware of the fact of what 
color you are?" 
It hit me like a punch in the face. 
25 
If this country was not what all 
the founding fathers 
said 
it was, then this was all a fallacy. 
At that point, I began 
to believe 
in two standards. 
Master and slave.

I used to grow a vegetable garden, but now I don't -- too

The homes here are collectively owned. 
This

Our numbers have dwindled. 
We had planned on expanding, but 
the Pinelands laws put a crimp in that.

it might

I've been a member of so many churches. (laughter.)

She's also a great organizer, and has 
organized horticultural shows educating people to the beauty and 
importance of native Pine Barrens plants.

Betty Woodford wrote a book that is 
like a bible for new

There are only a few copies left at the 
township office, but they have plenty of the McHarg study. 
BW: 
Dr. 
Ian McHarg 
is an ecologist and planner from the U. 
of 
Penn., and he has his graduate students out to different towns. 
Medford was working on 
its master plan.

hard to hear.) 
They studied the whole concept of what Medford 
Township is -- not exactly folklore, but the beginnings of the 
area. 
It's a good book. 
I helped many of the students who 
worked with him. 
I know folklore is your main thrust --
CC: 
No, 
it's not. 
The concept of folklore has changed. 
It 
is a

Deeper than folklore

in his report -- it's why he said only three—acre lots.

watersheds and the natural

We located in Deerbrook instead of Centennial Lakes 
because of the fear of fire. 
At times of the year, the lake

I know, but it 
is a basic fear of mine. 
BW: 
Not a single house has ever been burned in Medford Township. 
We have a fantastic volunteer fire company. 
ET: 
Is there a difference in the way these two developments are 
landscaped? 
BW: 
Centennial and our area is all 
natural. 
It's the kind of 
thing my book -- really a monograph -- 
is about. 
Pine Barrens 
plants are on the land that you find them on because that is the 
proper plant that should be there. 
You change it for a rose or a 
hydrangea, and you've lost your money.

it would 
have solved all 
our problems.

One of the 
greatest blessings has been what happened at Birchwood. 
Everyone 
fertilized their lawns and limed their gardens, and the lake got 
the bloom, and the plant and animal 
life was changed. 
If you 
change the pH, you've lost the land.

I spoke to a volunteer fireman in Lower Bank who says that

you should clear out the brush, because that is what carries the 
fire.

He probably means controlled burning. 
You don't need 
that. 
You need green things around the house, but you don't need 
lawn. 
And lawns are not what makes a person's house stand out as 
being special, because they have lawns 
in Moorestown, and other 
places. 
There's a rule 
in Birchwood that you can't have lawn. 
I 
was there to a wedding, and 
they had pleasant—looking mulch and 
so on, and the men were sitting around on this hot day saying, "I

The way the plots of 
land 
were laid out when they were inherited was 
in strips, not in 
chunks. 
Then each son had a place to get firewood, charcoal, to 
farm, etc. 
The Pine Barrens was theirs -- they could go out and 
pick blueberries in 
it and do 
lots of things. 
Then gradually the 
land was bought up and joined into large tracts -- like the 
Wharton tract. (Much 
is unintelligible here.)

I almost 
threw myself 
in front of a bulldozer. 
I said, "By whose 
authority are you removing this?" 
The man said he had orders, 
and he went ahead and cut the tree while I was on the phone 
finding out that indeed it was not to be cut. 
They don't care.

It's that chauvinistic male attitude. (laughter.) 
JJ: 
Our developer was splendid, but the man on the bulldozer

I had a friend who was building a home, and every 
tree that was not to be cut was wrapped with a yellow plastic 
ribbon.

You have to be right there.

This is

Yet every piece of 
land that abuts to a national or state 
refuge will be more valuable. 
They claim that they're losing a 
lot of money, but they're not. 
You should talk to Garfield 
DeMarco. 
(BW inquires about our area of research. 
Everyone chimes in that 
we need to see the developments around the lakes -- Centennial 
was mentioned, and we should see Betty Woodford's place above 
anything else.) 
JJ: 
If you're short on time, I'd advise you right now to pack up 
and go to Betty's. 
That's the key thing. 
Unidentified: 
She gives talks and lectures all 
over the east 
coast on the Pine Barrens. 
(BW talks about her refuge and gives her phone number: 
983-
3329 ) 
CC: 
We'd like to hear about your yards, because this is a multi— 
faceted project. 
Do you have plans for your yards? 
What would 
it be 
if you could get it there? 
Unidentified: 
We've been struggling for 13 years to get our yard 
in shape. 
You learn from experience what will not grow. If you 
have a lot of trees, you don't have much sun.

We're on Lower Etna Lake in Medford Lakes. 
BW: 
Medford Lakes had also done a wonderful job of not putting 
in paved streets and curbs. 
They also emphasize riding bicycles. 
(She discusses the separation of Medford Twp. and Medford Lakes 
-- they had to do 
it because Medford Twp. did not like a 
breakaway group with its own ideas.) 
JJ: 
There's a strong animosity between them. 
BW: 
Most of the wounds are healed now. 
JJ: 
A lot of new people coming in are not even aware of the 
rift, so 
it's fading. 
BW: 
Medford Lakes wanted better schools and other things. 
Unidentified: 
Medford Lakes started out as a summer community 
with log cabins. 
We 
live 
in one, but it's been converted so many 
times that you can hardly tell that it's 
log. 
Lillian: 
A lot of city people came and built those cabins 
themselves. 
Professional people. 
BW: 
New homes now have to be year—round. 
Lillian: 
Lake Pine had a terrible fire about 25 years ago. 
(They discuss how bad the fire was, with balls of fire. 
They 
also talk about how with all 
the influx of new people, there is 
increased danger of fire. 
The small fire companies have a hard 
time as a result.) 
ET: 
Have you taken any precautions in your homes to guard 
against fire? 
CB: 
We have fire drills and smoke detectors. 
No other 
precautions. 
BW: 
Many of these people live near large bodies of water which 
the fire dept. can use. 
My husband has an electric pump and also 
a gasoline pump so we can spray our buildings. 
15 
CB: 
We really rely on the fire department. 
(No one says they have done anything in their landscaping to 
prevent fire. 
Betty Woodford comments on knowing how to start 
the two pumps. 
She talks about being near a fire when the fire 
department wasn't there yet. 
She and her husband soaked their 
land, and by that time the fire dept. was there.) 
CB: 
Most of our properties aren't large enough for fire cuts or 
anything that you could really consider to work into the 
landscape. 
BW: 
The fire department is well—trained. 
We also have fire 
access lanes. 
(She explains fire behavior regarding high and low 
land and winds, and cross cuts.) 
We depend on those firemen. 
(None of these women have firemen in their families. 
One woman 
comments that they should have a paid fire company.) 
Unidentified: 
Lots of fire access lanes have been sold to the 
adjoining properties. 
CB: 
I think it's comforting, when you drive back 
in the woods to 
see where the fire cuts are. 
Unidentified: 
In 
landscaping, you shouldn't have pine trees 
right up next to your home so you have a trail of pine needles. 
BW: 
It's the shrubbery and the pileup of debris that is 
dangerous. 
But I dislike controlled burning. 
It makes the woods 
Thatcher--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 75 
very bare and unpleasant to walk 
in for a number of years. 
But 
it seems that it 
is the only thing they think will work. 
Unidentified: 
But the Pinus rigida doesn't do anything until 
there 
is a f 
ire . 
BW: 
If you heard holly and laurel burning like bacon on a fire, 
you'd find it hard to accept. 
But the scientists may have a 
point. 
(Elaine asks for more information on the drawings, since they 
will not have time to get around to everyone.) 
JJ: 
You should see the Cathedral of the Pines in Medford Lakes. 
It was the first church in the area -- originally a summer 
church. 
20 
Just a few years ago the Catholics built St. Mary's of 
the Lake. 
BW: 
The Quakers and Methodists are among the oldest churches in 
the area. 
JJ: 
Helen Johnson was doing a little history on the Methodist 
Church. 
Did she finish that before she died? 
(General confused talk.) 
CB: 
We talked about acid 
in the soil, but we also have to 
contend with shade. 
That puts us 
into a different form of 
gardening. 
Impatiens sell tremendously around here because they 
grow and add color. 
I put them in containers -- lots of 
container gardening on my decks so I can leave the native plants 
alone. 
We have some gorgeous swamp azaleas and blueberries that 
I treasure. 
We get hummingbirds and herons and waterfowl. 
We 
also see deer. 
We send the children out to kill 
the grass when 
it shows up. (laughter.) 
I love the leaves as ground cover. 
I 
go out and rake the street and put the leaves under our pine 
trees as ground cover. 
We don't have curbs, gutters or street 
lights. 
Unidentified: 
You won't find curbs and gutters except in some of 
the newer developments. 
25 
JJ: 
The ride out to Betty's place is more 
representative of our garden club's problems. 
Trenton makes 
decisions, and what they think of as lawns 
is fine for north 
Jersey, but it won't work here. 
Our soil 
is different, our way 
of 
living 
is different. 
BW: 
The agricultural department, building codes, rules about 
seeding the sides of excavations -- all 
are made in Trenton. 
Also the required angles of runoff. 
They'll tell you to put in 
rye grass to hold the soil. 
I told one man I'd give him $5 for 
every piece of rye grass that he planted that was still alive a 
year later. 
They couldn't find a single piece.

BW: 
Jeannette and others live 
in the conversion areas 
of the pines, where the soil 
is sandy enough, 
it will eventually 
lose 
its nutrients and will 
revert to the natural Pine Barrens 
flora. 
(plant), yardscapes. 
JJ: 
The problem is, that in the meantime, we need lawns, or we'd 
be a big dustbowl. 
When I first came and people saw how much I 
loved the Pine Barrens, they would give me plants like lady's 
slippers. 
I took three lady's slippers, and they didn't live. 
So I made a policy that I would not accept things from the Pine 
Barrens -- 
it was really cruel 
to accept them and then not have 
them live. 
The soil has not reverted. 
ET: 
Who are the main gardeners in your families? 
Do your 
husbands get involved? 
JJ: 
My husband's very involved. 
Louise: 
My husband mows the 
lawn, but I make decisions about 
what goes in. 
I do most of the weeding. 
My husband does what he 
can. 
He's the one that wants a lawn. 
We even put sod 
in 
two 
years ago. 
It was a waste of time and money. 
CB: 
The sand just works its way up and the acid, and all, and 
it 
ruins the lawn. 
People have tried layers of plastic to keep the 
sand down -- nothing works. 
Lillian: 
Leisuretowne has beautiful lawns now. 
Unidentified: 
You really have to build up the soil 
if you want a 
lawn. 
The high water table 
is another problem.

Unidentified: 
Everyone else 
is having a drought and we're 
growing mushrooms. 
(Several talking at once.) 
Unidentified: 
Sandy soil 
is another problem. 
It drains quickly. 
I have soil that holds moisture in back, and the front yard 
is 
sandy and dries out quickly. 
CB: 
I just let 
it alone. 
The whole point to 
living here 
is 
low— 
maintenance gardening -- let nature do 
its thing. 
I've done a 
few things with landscaping around the fence 
in front so 
it 
doesn't look like a Fort Apache. 
On the inside, I keep 
it as low 
maintenance as possible. 
This allows me to go for walks. 
ET: 
What do your husbands do? 
Louise: 
Mine works for Mobil Oil over in Valley Forge, 
Pennsylvania. 
I'm not employed outside the home 
Busy as 
president of the garden club.

Lillian: 
My husband 
is retired now, but was a 
nurseryman in Cinnaminson. 
Then he went to work for Arco. 
CB: 
Mine is a management consultant and travels alot. 
KH: 
Mine has a small manufacturing company in Burlington, and I 
work part time for him. 
Laura: 
Mine 
is a psychiatrist in Haddenfield, and I don't have a 
job. 
BW: 
Mine is a retired biology and agriculture teacher. 
I am a 
botanist, and free—lance writer and (unintelligible). 
Mrs. X: 
My husband owns a hardware store and 
is a retired Air 
Force colonel. 
I work at a local tree farm making wreaths and 
decorations at Christmastime. 
I am also very active in community 
activities. 
Right near here 
is the Indian Acres Tree Farm, which 
is the largest Christmas tree farm in New Jersey. 
ET: 
What uses do you make of the woods? 
Unidentified: 
Many things are on the endangered list, and we 
don't touch them. 
We are proud of this stuff and we want to keep 
it 
JJ: 
The mountain laurel 
in bloom is beautiful to see as you 
dri ve by. 
BW: 
But it's not something people expect to see 
in the Pine 
Barrens. 
Same with trailing arbutis. 
They can't explain why 
some of these things are so abundant in the Pine Barrens. 
Unidentified: 
People try to transport it and holly, and I've 
never heard of them growing. 
CB and all: 
We eat blueberries, strawberries, teaberries, 
raspberries (?). 
BW: 
I let the school children that visit pull up 
little 
sassafras roots. 
They peel them and dip 
in sugar, or eat plain 
or take home and make tea.

BW: 
I use the silver plastic stuff for Christmas. 
Unidentified: 
There are florists who use princess pine. 
(Everyone talking at once about how it grows in continuous 
roots 
so 
it 
is used for garlands, and one says you can pull 
off the top 
without taking the roots, but BW says you can't do that; the 
roots always come too.) 
BW: 
Laurel roping is too expensive, so people tend not to buy 
it. 
I'm glad about that. 
I know pineys who make their living 
off things 
in the woods, but much of 
it 
is not the rare things. 
They make cedar wreaths, pick up pine cones (Pinus rigida). 
Go 
to Fleck's (sp?) Floral Supply in Southampton and see what he 
sells. 
ET: 
Do any of you make or use grave blankets? 
BW: 
It's almost out. 
Very few people use them. 
Mrs. X: 
We make some at the tree farm.

Trimming the trees for that doesn't hurt anything. 
Once you

It got a lot of comments. 
People said it's not 
common; an isolated case; 
it's threatening and could mean "this 
could happen to you 
if you come in here." 
Someone asked if 
it 
was put up for Halloween -- no, 
it was too early.

BW: 
Since you're interested in folklore, have you 
checked into the glass industry? 
ET: 
I understand that it 
is no longer a living industry, that it 
is really 
in the past. 
BW: 
It 
is, 
if you compare it with the Italian fellow whose 
family probably moved here in the 
last generation. 
But I've 
heard, not seen it written, that the reason the Star Glass Works 
here 
in Medford survived so 
long (100 years) 
is because it was 
located near churches and schools and a community center where 
there was transportation in and out. 
Many furnaces collapsed for 
lack of 
labor. 
People wouldn't stay in areas where their 
youngsters couldn't get decent schooling. 
That's as good a 
folklore feature as you could think of.

history of education in the pines.)

You

be the 
same.

pumpkins and planters -- repetition.) 
KH: 
And meatball pruning. 
Going toward the shore, 
in the heavy Italian or German areas, 
is 
where I've seen these things. 
Also in Philly 
in the same types 
of ethnic neighborhoods. 
I don't know -- maybe it just seems 
Italian and German to me. 
Also Mt. Holly. 
This 
is all 
in 
the 
older, established sections where people have been there for a 
long time. 
Here, 
it 
is such a new area, there isn't a great deal 
of 
it. 
Areas like Burlington, Riverside, Delran (sp?) -- all 
have very uniform, very organized landscaping. 
yardscapes. 
CC: 
So you get a sense that there are two zones -- one 
maintenance—free, natural, no topiary, and the other with lots of 
manicuring, clean edges. 
KH: 
Around here (Medford), you find a great many stone driveways 
-- no maintenance, and you don't find that in Cherry Hill or 
Burlington, Willingboro, or Philadelphia. 
You don't find pine 
bark or pine needles much. 
People go bananas over our pine 
needles, which everybody just says, "Oh." 
But they don't use it 
outside our area -- the 
idea of mulch is new to them. 
A lot of 
people have taken their grass and turned it 
into nothing but pine 
needles. 
Every year you see a little more going to ground cover 
and mulch rather than grass. 
Especially as people become aware 
of the problems with fertilizer and grass. 
You forget when you 
live around here -- but when you drive around, you see this 
formal kind of landscaping -- ten items just alike. 
20 
This is 
landscaping to them, where everything we do 
is 
more toward the natural. 
And then the deer come and eat it. 
Maybe they don't have that problem. 
I'm from Idaho. 
Our yard 
there was a little patch of grass with pine trees and annual 
flowers. 
We couldn't have shrubs that flowered. 
The most normal 
shrubs around here are rhododendron, laurel and azaleas. 
None of 
these survive in a hardy zone. 
Out in the west you have to work 
to have anything green. 
I didn't have the same concern with 
natural 
landscaping there as I have here. 
Here, rain and 
humidity take care of things. 
I've had to 
learn a different set 
of skills. 
CC: 
Has your aesthetic changed? 
KH: 
Yes. 
Or, maybe not changed, because I didn't have much 
interest in any kind of maintenance or gardening then. 
But it 
could have gone either way -- toward more formal or low 
maintenance. 
People around here are so busy that they don't have 
time to work on their properties. 
People are busy with sports --
we have a lot of players for different teams. 
We also have a 
very child—oriented area. 
Every kid from the age of eight until 
they're fourteen plays 
in organized sports year round. 
Everyone 
gets involved. 
They have a very special value for the kids and 
would rather spend the time with them than out mowing the lawn. 
Thatcher--83 Reel—to—reel

page 82 
And since you can't get the kids to do 
it, you have to get 
somebody to. 
men, women, children, recreation. 
Men rarely get involved in activities with this garden club. 
Most of them commute to Philadelphia, New York, Delaware -- some 
don't get home until 7:30 at night. 
They don't have enough time 
to do something like this. 
I think that's the reason.

elaborate breakfast after Mass. 
We don't do 
it anymore. 
(celebration). 
During the summer, I used to sell hundreds of baskets of 
Thatcher--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 84 
tomatoes and apples. 
Now I put out ten. 
People don't can 
anymore. 
That's the way of 
life today. 
(foodways). 
Ralph: 
One guy was begging his wife to buy some asparagus. 
She 
said, no, 
it's too much work -- you have to wash it about ten 
times. 
100 
(Charlie Palmieri enters.) 
Sal: 
Old people die, and things change. 
Ralph: 
We used to be able to give people the baskets, but 
now we make them bring them back. 
Sal: 
We used to make sausage in the winter and hang it up so the 
rats and mice couldn't get it. 
Made of deer meat. 
You had to 
preserve for the wintertime. 
The Mass has really changed. 
It's English, and some of them 
play music, and then you turn around and shake hands -- I 
personally don't like it. 
I used to go to High Mass. 
You'd walk 
through the church and you felt the holiness -- you really did. 
It used to take an hour and the choir would sing. 
Now the altars 
are gone compared to what they used to be. 
(Sal goes and gets his wedding album to show pictures of the 
altar when he and his wife got married in 1947. 
Carl comments 
that some changes seem to be occasioned by the move to America --
others, 
like those 
in the church may be related to other things.) 
Ralph: 
Sal and I aren't even Catholic anymore. 
Sal goes to a 
Baptist church and I go to a Congregationalist one. 
Sal, Jr.: 
Did you ever eat an asparagus omelet? 
My mom used to 
make 
it. 
(More discussion of the changes in the altar. 
Ralph says 
it 
is 
too expensive to make them like that nowadays. 
Sal, Sr. says 
that they changed it -- took 
it out.) 
churches. 
Sal, Sr.: 
My personal opinion 
is that it was more holier back 
in 
those days. 
You felt the glory. 
200 
(Carl gets permission to copy a couple of photos, and there 
is miscellaneous chatting about the pictures.) 
People in the pictures: 
Carmen Palmieri (Josephine's brother) -- his nickname was "Polar" 
because he was so hairy, 
like a polar bear. 
Nevicella DeMarco Palmieri -- her name means "snow." 
She was 
named that because it snowed when she was born, and that was rare 
there. 
"Snow from heaven." 
Josephine Palmieri Putiri -- also known as Emma and Phini. 
Salvatore Joseph Putiri -- Joseph was his confirmation name. 
You 
got your middle name when you were confirmed. 
It was a saint's 
name. 
But I changed that when I named my boys. 
Ralph's middle 
name is Carmen after the one that died. 
Sal's is Philip, after 
my uncle. 
Carmen means Charles. 
My uncle Philip wouldn't talk to my father for two years 
because he named me Salvatore instead of after Philip. 
Then my 
father wouldn't talk to my brother Vince because he named his kid 
after Vincent. 
My brother wasn't even allowed in the house for 
Thatcher--83 Reel—to—reel

about a year! 
(Laughter.) 
That was tradition, but it's changed. 
(Ralph says that he picked a saint's name when he was confirmed 
-- Andrew -- but it didn't become part of his legal name.) 
naming. 
Martha Russo Putiri -- Sal's mother. 
Salvatore Putiri -- Sal's father. 
300 
Sal, Jr.: 
My mother used to make eggplant parmesan with 
stuffed eggplant. 
The stuffing had eggplant, olives, seasonings, 
mushrooms, sausage, anchovies. 
Bake it and put melted cheese on 
top. 
Aunt Olga makes it for us now. 
I don't know where her name 
came from -- Olga. 
It's Russian, 
isn't it? 
I'm sure she's named 
after somebody -- everyone is named after someone. (foodways). 
(Other picture -- Sal and Josephine with Gracie Ricci. 
Sal 
continues to identify people in pictures.) 
(Several conversations at once.) 
400 
Sal, Sr.: 
We had a couple hundred guests -- my wedding cost 
me $600. 
Weddings were cheap back then. 
(celebration). 
Charlie: 
I was married once, and had five hundred people at my 
wedding. 
Ralph: 
You have to 
invite everyone in the family, and that's a 
lot of people. 
(Ralph wonders how cold the swamps are and 
if he could go 
out and collect moss today.) 
Charlie: 
I work night shift at a bakery. 
I can stay up for two 
or three days, but then I have to sleep for a couple of days. 
I 
work at Lucas Bakery -- an Italian bakery. 
The chef makes roasts 
in the oven, and at four in the morning we all sit around and 
eat. 
It's for parties, but we all have some. 
Today I'm working 
here making grave blankets. 
I made 1000 blankets last year. 
(Tape off—on.) 
labor, arts and crafts. 
Sal, Sr.: 
We sell grave blankets retail and wholesale. 
Ralph: 
Some cemeteries leave them on for months -- others only 
leave them a couple of weeks.

Sal, Sr.: 
Families were all 
close back when I was a kid. 
Holidays were a big thing. 
Everyone got together. 
This year 
we'll probably go to my sister's. 
My wife died 
in March, so we 
don't know what we're going to do. 
But life must go on. 
(Earlier the Putiris talked about how they used to go to 
Philadelphia to see the Mummers' Parade on New Years every year.) 
We don't go see 
it anymore -- you can watch it on television. 
We 
used to go to my Uncle Philip's, then the trolley to Camden, the 
ferry to Philadelphia, then walk up market street and catch the 
trolley. 
A lot of effort, right? 
(celebration) 
I used to sell magazines on the trains. 
I worked for United 
News at the time. 
I'd ride to Atlantic City, spend the day, and 
ride back -- sold merchandise both ways. 
(Phone in background, 
and Ralph talking on 
it.)

(Sal, Sr. continued) 
Have you ever heard the expression 
about squealing like a stuck pig? 
It's really true. 
When we 
butchered pigs, we slit their throat. 
We saved the blood and 
made blood pudding. 
One day the pig got loose -- it really 
squealed. 
(foodways). 
Ralph: 
That poor pig. 
Sal, Sr.: 
Well, that's what we ate. 
Where are you gonna get the 
meat? 
Thatcher--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 87 
Ralph: 
I don't know. 
(Phone again. 
Ralph says that they can't have their oven 
delivered today.) 
Sal, Sr.: 
We used to kill chickens, too -- stretch the neck to 
kill them, then put them in a pot of hot water and remove the 
feathers. 
Just stretch the neck and hang them up. 
(Ralph 
comments that an uncle used to chop the heads off.) 
Sal, Jr.: 
We saw these animals as pets, and then one day you 
didn't see them, and there's a big turkey on the table. 
Later 
you find out we ate our own pet! 
(animal). 
Sal, Sr.: 
Look at the money you saved! 
Sal, Jr.: 
We had a few ducks. 
We'd whistle and they'd all start 
quacking -- the females always made the loudest noise. 
Sal, Sr.: 
My cousin used to raise cows. 
One day I rode the cow, 
and 
it wouldn't give milk for three days -- I thought my uncle 
was going to kill me. 
(Tape off -- everyone goes out to the 
greenhouse where they are making grave blankets.)

Ralph: 
I pin the greens into the styrofoam base for the 
logs. 
Then you put a bow, some red poinsettias, maybe some 
silver ruscus.

(Sue takes pictures of an undecorated piece. 
Cousin Charlie is 
making blanket bases. 
Sal, Sr. comes 
in and they make a fuss 
over the fact that he shaved while in the house.) 
Charlie: 
I'm getting seven blankets per bundle of greens. 
Ralph: 
The big blankets, decorated, will go for $7.75. 
The 
smaller ones will sell for $4.50 decorated and $3.25 undecorated. 
Charlie: 
Does my price go up? 
I get a bonus, don't I. 
Ralph: 
The price of greens went up. 
We've got to get more moss.

Putiris can see how material from another project was used. 
Sal 
starts to sing a song about the Blue Ridge Mountains.

Ralph: 
Just as 
long as he doesn't sing the one about the three 
girls from Baltimore. 
(They josh each other about the kinds of 
songs Sal 
knows. 
Sal says he will make a cross for us to see. 
General talk about the end of the project and unemployment.) 
15 
Ralph: 
I like the stainless steel cutters for cutting 
greens. 
I like stainless steel everything. 
We get the 
poinsettias and decorations from a place in Whiting that has a 
catalog. 
I have enough decorations left from last year, so I 
won't buy anything this year except red ruscus. 
(To Charlie:) 
You don't have to count anymore, Charlie. 
Let's work out of the 
same bundle of greens so we have more room on the counter. (To 
fieldworker:) 
This stuff 
is streptocarpus. 
(sp?) 
We call 
it 
Bavarian Bells. 
(Sal, Sr. cuts wire with Ralph's stainless steel plant clippers, 
saying as he does 
it that he knows it will 
ruin the clippers. 
He 
demonstrates making a cross.) 
Sal, Sr.: 
They (crosses) sell wholesale for about $1.75, retail 
$2.95—$3.50. 
Depends on what area you're in. 
The richer they 
are, the more they pay! 
A lot of these are going to Philadelphia 
and Atlantic City -- the big city areas.

Ralph: 
All the moss we're using 
is from last year. 
(He 
indicated somewhere in the discussions that they would have to go 
and gather more moss for this season.) 
Sal, Sr.: 
Usually, when we get going on making these things, we 
spread everything out -- the red ones, the white ones, so you can 
get a production line going. 
(He finishes the cross. 
Sue 
photographs it.) 
Sal, Sr.: 
You can make lots of variations.

Sal, Sr.: 
My wife was very good at this. 
We used to make the 
laurel roping by hand, and she was really good at that, she'd 
wrap one end around her leg. 
(Ralph asks Sal 
to make a couple of 
bases, but Sal continues to work on the log.) 
Ralph: 
One lady that makes them for us makes them so spectacular 
-- little gold balls here and there, and the greens have to be a 
certain size. 
It's Sally, who you met one night. 
She makes all 
our bows. 
Mom used to do 
it. 
(He sends Claudie to get a bag of 
bows.) 
Sally and my Mom used to be close friends. 
She clips 
coupons for us and keeps an eye on us.

I can really dress it up for you

Ralph: 
No, don't; 
it looks tacky now.

You got

lobe sticking in the other lobe. 
Sal: 
Ah, Ralph, now if you're gonna start calling the shots on 
it . . . . 
Ralph: 
To Sally, 
it would be a cardinal sin to have the red 
ruscus sticking up above the greens. 
Sal, Sr.: 
Like I said, to each his own.

We have to go 
in and cut the live greens.

Ralph: 
I like to cover the wire on the bow with something 
like a pine cone. 
Sal, Sr: 
I'm glad you reminded me. 
Ralph: 
You've got to preen your bow. 
Sal, Sr.: 
See, everyone likes to do it their own way. 
Was there 
anything wrong with that before he stuck his two cents in? 
(Ralph adjusts the little gold deer. 
Claude brings the base for 
a cemetery cone, the cheapest item they make.) 
Sal, Sr.: 
I like the decorations on the log balanced, he 
doesn't. 
Ralph: 
My father's symmetrical, and I'm asymmetrical.

lunch.) 
Sal: 
The Columbia II restaurant is 
run by Dominic (Amendolia) 
and his family -- it's a family affair. 
We never use dried flowers on our blankets.

Collecting the 
moss 
is the biggest thing. 
We collect down by Mannheim Avenue.

Also some 
talk of the plants growing in the greenhouse. 
The Putiris grow 
some plants for sale at the stand. 
They don't heat the 
greenhouse in the winter for the few plants they have. 
Sal 
returns with some items for putting 
in the middle of the bow.) 
Ralph: 
Some things people won't buy for a cemetery. 
It should 
be a little dignified for that. 
We wouldn't put the "Merry 
Christmas" sign or the smiling Santa on a grave blanket. 
People 
who buy them for their kids' graves often order those things, 
though.

Ralph: 
We could put a candy cane on the bow, but the pine 
cone 
is the way we really do 
it. 
Sal, Sr.: 
That's the general 
idea of the log. 
I like to dress 
them up more than this, though. 
There's one lady that has us 
make an elaborate blanket for her son -- $50.00. 
She's been 
doing 
it for years. 
She's from Philadelphia. 
I'm going to make a spectacular one for my wife.
