The Juice of the Forbidden Fruit
THE JUICE OF THE FORBIDDEN FRUIT 5034 B3
Mr. and Mrs. R.I. Lewis Shiloh, N. J., 1941
'Twas Adam's intention to make an invention He got it up simple and cute In an old-
fashioned mill he managed to distill The juice of the forbidden fruit.
And ever since then all manner of men The lame and the blind and the mute The bankers
and clerks, politicians and Turks Drink the juice of the forbidden fruit.
In the garden of Eden old Eve climbed a tree An apple tree long fore the war And threw
down the core that made her so sore For her henpecked husband to chaw.
And ever since then all manner of men The lame and the blink and the mute The bankers
and clerks, politicians and Turks Drink the juice of the forbidden fruit.
Frank James, so they said,…bed, … and ate like a brute And Charles and Bob Ford, drank
out of a gourd The juice of the forbidden fruit.
