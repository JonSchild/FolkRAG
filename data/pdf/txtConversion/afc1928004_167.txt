WHEN THE BAND BEGINS TO PLAY. 
Written and composed by G. W. IluNr. 
I'm very fond of music—to me its quite a 
treat, 
Unless it be from German Bands, or Organs in the street. 
Thro' lisening to a 
band one day, I 
fairly lost my heart ? 
The leader ' twas who found it and he now with it won't part. 
CHORUS. 
Oh I 
feel so awfully jolly when the band begins to play, 
When the baud begins to play, when the band begins to play, 
I'm very fond of music, I 
could listen all the day, 
Especially when my Charlie leads the band—Porn, Porn. 
My Charlie is my darling—the beau ideal of loves, 
With his hair so black and curly, and his whitest of white gloves. 
My love stands in the middle, with his baton in his hand, 
And leads the instrumentalists in a 
style that I 
think grand. 
Oh 1 
I 
feel so awfully jolly when the band begins to play, Scc. 
They play such jolly music—waltz, polka, and quadrille, 
And sometimes play so feelingly, it gives me a 
quite thrill, 
The leader sometimes gives a 
frown, and looks as though he's rash; 
And then they play so soft and sweet, and after comes a 
crash. 
Oh I 
I 
feel so awfully jolly when the band begins to play, & c. 
Now, where my Charlie's to be seen, I 
don't intend to tell, 
For fear that ho might captivate some other belle as well. 
lie's asked me " one small question,"—I 
gave him my reply— 
In about a 
month there will not be a 
happier wife than I. 
Oh! I 
feel so awfully jolly when the band begins to play, & e.

She always comes to see me, und annosd every day.

CHORUS. 
Una my gal she says she feels bully, ven my band begins

Von de band begins to blay, ven my band begins to blay. 
I'm as habby, like a 
sardine, von I

A listening to de music of my band, bum ! bum ! 
Und yen ve resd a

dalk to her a

lemonade, mit a 
stick in hi; 
Den I 
asg her of she'll have some more, yen to me she will 
say, 
No dank you; but I 
rather hear your band begin to blay. 
Und my gal says, ite.

Von I

Somehow dey don't like de music ven my band begins to

Und my gal says, &c. 
But den dere vas a

• 
O 
AWFULLY CLEVER. 
I'm a 
fella who doesn't like bothar, 
All trouble's a 
deuce of a 
bore; 
I've an income left me by my mothaw, 
What on earth could a 
fella want more ? 
My favorite sport's killing time, 
My aim's to do nothing at all ; 
While some thro' this world run or climb, 
I 
take the trip easy and crawl. 
CHORUS. 
But they tell me I'm awfully clevar, 
0, so clevar, deuced clevar, 
They say that they nevar, no nevar 
Met a 
fella so clevar before. 
Some fellas go in for the army, 
And some fellas go in for trade; 
But I 
havn't such bores to alarm me, 
My fortune was already made. 
And some fellas go in for brains, 
And scribble to turn in a 
penny ; 
Those fellas deserve all their gains, 
As for brains I 
could do without any. 
But they tell, kte. 
In the Park I 
am often seen driving, 4 
When the dear girls take me for a 
duke ; 
Whenever I 
go in for billiards, 
Somehow Fin a 
demon to fluke. 
Sometimes to an evening party, 
To keep them alive in I 
peep ; 
Whenever they ask me to sing, 
They're certain to fall fast asleep. 
But they tell, cte. 
The fellas will borrow a 
tenner, 
For which I 
get DO I 
0 U; 
Sometimes I 
assist them in bills, 
Which I 
have to pay when they're due. 
There are mothers with daughters to marry, 
Somehow take a 
fancy to me; 
They think they're as deep as Old Harry, 
But the bait and the hook I 
can see. 
But they tell, &c.

" 
BURNT OUT." 
OR, PITY THE HOMELESS. 
By JAMES R. M URRAY', 
Published and for sale by Wtarr., SMITH & PERRY, 298 and 300 Wash. 
ingtou Street, Boston. Price 40 Cents. 
Pity the homeless, pity the poor, 
By the fierce Fire fiend forced to your door; 
List to their pleading, list to their cry, 
Pass them not heedlessly by. 
Roused from their slumbers, peaceful and sweet, 
hastening in terror into the street, 
Leaving behind them treasures most dear, 
Flying in anguish and fear. 
CHORUS. 
Pity the homeless, pity the poor, 
By the fierce Fire fiend forced to your door; 
List to their pleading, list to their cry, 
Pass them not heedlessly, heedlessly by. 
See how the Fire king leaps in his joy! 
As his dread minions haste to destroy; 
See how the homes, once peaceful and fair, 
Wrapped in the flumes, melt in air. 
Haste then, and help them, who from their home 
Shelterless, foodless, wearily roam, 
Pity their anguish, list to their prayers, 
Lighten their labors and cares. 
Pity the homeless, pity the poor, 
By the fierce Fire fiend forced to your door; 
List to their pleading, list to their cry, 
Pass them not heedlessly, heedlessly by.

Lovely and fair is my darling Patchoula, 
With eyes tender blue as the mid summer's sky, 
She is my jewel, my heart's fondest treasure, 
The bloom on her cheek will the roses out-vie. 
She treats coldly my passionate ardor, 
Oh its then that I 
love her the harder, 
Tho' she says on her life, she'd ne'er be a 
wife, 
Such a 
dear little witch is Patchoula. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, beautiful, bewildering, Patchoula, 
My dear little riddle Patchoula, 
She can fool me at will, but I'll think of her still, 
My witching, my darling Patchoula. 
When I 
firit saw Patchoula, one bright summer's morning, 
She stood by the side of her own father's gate— 
The smile that she gave me, had the spell of a 
charmer, 
'Twas then that I 
knew I 
had met all my fate. 
With her manners so bewitching and simple, 
her cheeks are so roguish and dimpled ; 
What care I 
of life, if she'd be my wife, 
My own little darling, Patchoula. 
Oh, beautiful, bewildering, Patchoula, 
My dear little riddle Patchoula, 
She can fool me at will, but I'll think of her still, 
My witching, my darling, Patchoula. 
I'm going to tei.: a 
story, 
The ti t.th of which I 
know, 
Of Mary Anne, a 
servant girl, 
Whose sweetheart's name was Joe. 
Of her mistress and her six-room house 
She was by no means proud : 
For 'twas one of those strict places. 
Where " No FOLLOWERS ARE ALLOWED. 9 
I 
heard her once relate 
How her mistress she did do ; 
One evening, when her Joseph came— 
And he was nigh DONE too— 
One night, said she, my missus went 
Quite early to the play, 
And just as if it was to be, 
My Joseph came that way. 
He threw stones at the window— 
I 
ope'd the area gate 
And let him in and laid the cloth 
For supper, ere ' twas late. 
As nice a 
ham as e'er you clapped 
Your two eyes on, Nre'd there, 
And as luck would have it on that day, 
The man had brought the beer! 
When all at once came Missus back— 
Whatever should I 
do ? 
(She'd changed her mind about the play :) 
So down the stairs I 
flew, 
Poor Joseph creeping like a 
cat 
Into the copper slid. 
(Ah! lucky thought !)—but how I 
felt 
As I 
popped down the lid. 
Then down came Missus and said she : 
' 
We wash to-morrow morn— 
You'd better light the copper fire, 
And make the water warm." 
I 
nearly dropped down with affright : 
But I 
was forced to go 
And dip the water, which I 
poured 
Into the copper on poor Joe. 
I 
whispered to dear Joseph, 
As the first pail roused his ire, 
" 
Don't never mind the water, dear, 
I 
won't make up much fire." 
My missus brought the lueifer, 
And I 
was forced to strike it. 
And to light the fire—while poor Joe 
Kicked as it he didn't like it. 
I 
really sank while he got hot, 
When a 
thought came in my Imead— 
Says I : " Mum, since you have been out 
One of your fowls is dead," 
She took the candle in her hand. 
And by its flickering glimmer, 
Joe bolted up the area steps. 
Just as he began to si 
KER."

WISH ME GOOD-NIGHT, ONCE MORE. 
We were boys when we first went a 
Maying, 
Went a 
Maying—gayly playing, 
'Neath the sweet-scented hawthorn tree, swaying 
In the soft ev'ning breeze to and fro, 
In the cool of the twilight we wander'd, 
And bare-footed wal k'd in the stream, 
Or stroll'd by the bright little rivulet, 
And our lives glided on like a 
dream. 
Hark, hark, hark ! 
Then we saw ' twas the the shade of night creeping, 
Stars were peeping—birds were sleeping, 
And Mother her lone watch is keeping, 
So with me once more " Good- night !" 
Hark ! &yo. 
Then when night o'er our cottage came stealing, 
Slowly stealing— stars revealing, 
At our dear Mother's feet fondly kneeling, 
Soon we told her of all we had seen. 
Then with bright happy hopes for to-morrow, 
We sought our repose for the night, 
And we long'd for the (laylight's returning, 
To wake in the sunshine so bright. 
Hark, hark, hark ! 
Then a 
kiss from dear Father and Mother, 
Loving Mother—dearest Mother, 
With a 
blessing from one and the other, 
I 
wished them once more " Good- night !" 
hark !

THE LADY WITH THE MON 
IC E'57 XIIF1 • 
AIR 1—" The Tater Can." 
I 
fancied I 
knew town quite well, 
And was up to the time of day ; 
But I've, alas, a 
victim fell, 
To female craft and Fashion's sway 
A 
stuffier of female fashion, 
An advocate for all things new; 
For Monkey muffs I 
had a 
passion, 
rye proved myself a 
great " muff" too. 
A 
foolish thought got in my head 
Of matrimony and such stuff; 
I 
vow'd I'd the first damsel wed, 
That I 
saw with the Monkey muff 
While walking out in Regent street, 
Endeavoring to cut a 
shine ; 
A damsel smart I 
chanced to meet, 
Ye Gods I 
I 
thought she was divine, 
Attired in garments quite expensive, 
A 
lady quite, thought I, no doubt! 
Beneath her crinoline extensive, 
A 
pair of tiny feet peeped out. 
As I 
stood with enraptured gaze, 
I 
at a 
glance saw quite enough; 
The sight I 
saw did inc amaze, 
For she lad a 
large black Monkey muff. 
Accosting her, I 
said, '` Dear Miss, 
The liberty excuse I 
pray; 
I 
will prove a 
lasting source of bliss, 
If you at once will name the day. 
" 
Consent," said I, with eyes averted, 
" 
A 
negative will drive me mad !" 
But she did not seem disconcerted, 
But said at.once she would be glad. 
I 
promised her I'd call next day— 
Upon her " dad," one Mr. Luff; 
Determined nought should bar the way, 
Between me and the Monkey muff. 
11] 
• 
LADY WITH THE MONKEY MUFF.—CoNcLuDED. 
Now as I 
was a 
Volunteer, 
I 
thought, perhaps, twould be as well 
To in my uniform appear, 
Which made me look a 
martial swell. 
I 
introduced was to her father, 
But my surprise scarce knew no hounds; 
He said. ere we were wed, he'd rather 
I 
would lay down five hundred pounds 
Said I, " D'ye think that I'm a 
flat ? 
I'll let you know I'm up to snuff." 
Then snatched up what I 
thought my hat, 
But which turned out her Monkey muff 
And as I 
walked along the street, 
Some little boys did me descry; 
In language vile they did me greet, 
With " Holler, boys, another guy." 
Macadam stones and bits of gravel, 
In showers they at my cranium flung; 
The reason I 
could not unravel— 
I 
felt their necks I 
could have wrung. 
A 
pretty pickle 'twas you'll own, 
I 
didn't like such usage rough; 
Just then an vrchin threw a 
stone, 
And sprawling sent the Monkey muff. 
I 
saw the cause of all my woes, 
The moment that it off did fall ; 
Her treachery it did disclose, 
plainly could see through it all. 
She, finding I 
would not be gammoned 
And was not easy to be led; 
From the sofas she, my hat abstracted, 
And p 
aced her muff down there instead. 
So Volunteers take heed by me, 
When leaving sweethearts in a 
huff; 
In taking up your hat, just see 
That it is not her Monkey muff.

PURELY A MATTER OF TASTE. 
Written by Jimmy CLIFTON. 
You have heard of a 
sensible proverb, no 'doubt, 
Which observes, " Many men—many minds I" 
We have most of us met in our travels about, 
Funny fancies of numberless kinds 
Now, I 
never dispute what my neighbor may say, 
Tho' I 
think it absurd or inisplae'd; 
But I 
mildly remark in my own quiet way, 
That it's purely a 
matter of taste. 
CHORUS. 
It's a 
matter of taste, quite a 
matter of taste, 
Oh ! it's purely a 
matter of taste ; 
It's a 
matter of taste, quite a 
matter of taste, 
Oh ! it's purely- a 
matter of taste. 
On the question of love, as we all of us know, 
Folks opinions are likely to clash ; 
I, myself, was devoted, a 
long while ago, 
To a 
widow, just forty, with cash. 
When I 
say she was plain, you may possibly hint, 
That I 
chose her thro' folly or haste ; 
You may have a 
dislike to red hair and a 
squint, 
But it's purely a 
matter of taste. 
It's a 
matter, &c. 
I 
was jilted at last, for a 
rival appear'd, 
in the shape of an elderly swell ;. 
With a 
very red nose, and a 
very .groy beard, 
And a 
sham set of grinders as well. 
To he buried in grief, was the rirdit thing to do, 
But my time was too precious to waste ; 
So I 
said, " Well, I 
thought 1 
was best of the two, 
But it's purely a 
matter of taste." 
It's a 
matter, & e. 
I 
am finally married and settled at last, 
And I 
feel the ino-4, happy of men; 
Though Inv wife has a 
notion that latch keys are " fast," 
And I 
have to be home before ten. 
I 
am also forbidden to smoke any more, 
Which condition I've gladly embraced ; 
Many folks might imagine my life was a 
bore, 
But it's purely a 
matter of taste. 
It's a 
matter, tIrc.

BLIGHTED HOPES. 
There were two lovers young and fair, 
Who liv'd in London town, 
Their young affections blighted were, 
By Fortune's cruel frown 
He was a 
footman brave and gay, 
Who liv'd in Belgrave square ; 
She was an ' ouse-maid, \Ow all day 
Work'd hard down in Mayfair. 
One night he met her fetching of the beer, 
lie said to her—said he— 
"My lovely girl only first say the word, 
And we will married be !" 
She mttrmur'd out a 
modest " Yes," 
Then shed a 
silent tear, 
Which footman Jeames he kiss'd away, 
Then drank up all the beer. 
He asked her parents to consent, 
A thing they did refuse, 
But solid young Jeames's brilliant plush, 
With mud from off their shoes. 
At first they thought of suicide, 
And soon a 
knife did find, 
But when they came to the sticking point, 
They didn't seem inelin'd. 
They started for some sea-side place, 
To say " farewell I" and dine, 
When they were smash'd in a 
scurs:on train, 
On the Crashem-over line ; 
Their parents sued for damages, 
And got five hundred pound, 
They started for Australia, 
Were shipwrecked, lost and drown'd. 
Each night upon the salt sea waves, 
The parents weep and wail, 
The father is a 
Merinzin 110W, 
And mourns o'er his sad tail; 
The lovers sit on the Railway line, 
No trains they now do fear. 
But glare with eyes like signal lamps 
Eat cheese, and drink small beer.

THE PROMENADE ELASTIQUE. [CoNcLuDED.1 
I 
used to try the Roman Fall, 
But suffered from such pain, 
I 
got a 
stiffness in the back 
Would scarce come out again. 
Severeal Turkish Baths I 
took, 
And it was only last week, 
This new idea occurred to me 
" 
The Promenade Elastique." 
Cno. 
If all who tried the Roman Fall, 
Like inc experienced pain, 
I 
don't suppose it ever will 
Be popular again. 
And so if those, who patronized 
The fashion of the past, seek 
For something new, I'd recommend 
" 
The Promenade Elastique." 
Cuo. 
I'm certain that this fashion will 
In time gain great renown. 
And surely will adopted be 
By every swell in town; 
It's just the thing for those young gents, 
Who always something fast seek, 
So graceful, light and airy is-
The Promenade Elastique. 
Spoken after 4th verse.-You may find a 
little difficulty at first, 
you know, and may be chaffed a 
little, as I 
was, really. 
As I 
was 
going through the Park, yesterday, a 
dirty little boy shouted: 
" 
D'ye ' ear, mister, ' ave ye got the staggers ?"- Really,-" No 'e 
ain't, it's the screws at the joints want tightening."- Really. 
I 
was rather annoyed at the time, as Miss de Chignon happened 
to pass, and, of course, I 
had to stop and speak to her. " Really," 
I 
said, " you look as charming as a 
delicate camelia, and your 
eyes are brighter than the most sparkling brilliants."-" Do you 
think so, Mr. Pinkey," she said (my name's Pinkey, Maurice 
Pinkey), " you are looking well."-" Yaas," I 
said, " they say I'm 
quite a 
pot, what do you think of my flower, Miss de Chignon."-
" 
A 
great deal more," she replied, " than I 
do of the pot."-" Now, 
really, Miss de Chignon, your sarcasm is bitter enough to blight 
the flower and crack the pot."-" That's impossible," she said. 
" 
Why," I enquired. " Because," she replied, " I'm afraid it was 
cracked before."-" Really," I 
said, " that's too bad, really." " Why, 
what's the matter with you, Mr. Pinkey," she asked, " why do yon 
jump up and dlwn like that, are you ill ?"-" Ill, my dear," I 
said, 
" 
no, really, don't you know what it is ?"-" No," she said, " how 
should I."- Well, then," I 
replied-Cuo.

LEAVE IT TO ME. 
Miss Kate Kollwobble was the star 
On whom I 
used to gaze, 
Miss Kate Kollwobble had a 
Pa 
Of most peculiar ways, 
I 
loved Miss Kate Kollwobble much, 
And thought my wife she'd be, 
But lost Miss Kate 'cause some one said, 
" 
Old boy leave it to me." 
CHORUS, 
Leave it to me, leave it to me. 
You'd better far leave it to mc. 
Ill pull you thro' and proper too, 
if you'll but leave it to me." 
Old Tom Tomnoddy was my pal, 
On whom I'd oft rely, 
Old Tom Tomnoddy I 
nerer shall 
Forget—he was so fly. 
I 
told this Tom Tomnoddy once, 
Of how I 
loved that she, 
Then Mr. T., replied, " Old boy 
You'd best leave that to me." 
[Leave it, & c. 
He said he'd soon make things all right, 
But then the sly old elf, 
When he made things all right— of course— 
He did it for himself. 
He courted Kate by deputy, 
" 
You'll soon be wed." said he ; 
I 
said, " How ? where? and tell me when ?" 
Said he, " Leave that to me." [Leave it, &e. 
But very oft Tomnoddy came 
With tales that caused me joy. 
I 
gave him sovereigns by the score, 
lie said " It's right, my boy ! 
You must make presents, and I 
know 
The sort that suits this she, 
As I 
ant in the jewell'ry trade, 
You'd best leave that to me." 
He, with my money, pleased her so 
That he got her 4;onsent, 
To go to Church and married be, 
But he—not I—'twas went, 
So if' you want a 
thing well done, 
Do it yourzelf! you see 
You mustn't trust . 1

MY OWN DARLING KATE. 
I 
am weeping, darkies, now, 
I'll tell you all why 
It's all for Nay own darling little Kate. 
I'll ne'er forget the day, 
When they took her far away, 
I'm sure this darkey's heart is going to break. 
CHORUS. 
My own darling, sweet little Kate, 
She liv'd near the Louisana shore, 
I 
remember well the day 
They took her away; 
My dear Kate I'll never see you more. 
I 
cannot play my banjo, 
0 would that I 
were dead, 
For my own darling Kate now I 
sigh; 
She's gone from the shore, 
I'll never see her more, 
There nothing left this darkey but to die. 
My own darling, & 
0 
massa's gone away, 
We will never see him more, 
The plantation's gone from my view; 
Then lay me gently down, 
In the cold, cold ground, 
My Kate, dear, I'm dying now for you. 
My own darling, tke. 
BRIGHT-EYED JENNIE LEE. 
In boyhood's days, when all seem'd fair, 
With spirits ever light and gay, 
Thro' verdant fields and shady groves, 
At early morn I 
take my way. 
The blossom's fragrance fill'd the air, 
And earth seent'd parad:se to me, 
The fairest rose of any there 
Was darling, bright eye'd jenuie Lee. 
CHORUS. 
Jennie Lee, dear Jennie Lee, 
My heart is bird with thou_dits of thee, 
My life and all the world to me 
Is darling, bright-eye'd Jennie Leo. 
The land of dreams has faded now. 
And many happy years have flown, 
lint life we find has still some charms, 
Some pleasure hitherto unknown. 
Unehang'd, undying is our love, 
And as we near the unknown sea 
My heart, my pray'rs will still be thine. 
My darling, bright-eyed Jennie Lee.

ST. JAMES AND ST. GILIES OF THE PERIOD. 
Written by J. A. 
HARDWICK. 
A IR:-" John Jones." 
In this Nineteenth Century contrasts are numerous, 
And I'll give a 
ditty, descriptive and humorous, 
Of Period St. James, with his wealth and enjoyment, 
And Period St. Giles, with his want of enmloyrnent. 
Period St. James has gold cash, and notes proper, 
Period St. Giles seeking tin—notes the " Copper ;" 
To beg critics pardon I 
feel much anxiety, 
But a 
Policeman's called " Copper " in vulgar socity. 
St. James and St. Giles of the Period Pm noting. 
St. James and St. Giles is the theme of my song. 
Period St. James, as a " Lion " will dash about, 
Period St. Giles will lie on, hawking traqi about; 
Period St. James apes the " Roman Fall " fashion in, 
Period St. Giles, he may roam and fall famishing ! 
With Period St. James, a 
bright diamond pin it is, 
With Period St. Giles, double diamond Gin it is ; 
Period St. James, with the " Upper Ten " free he is, 
Period St. Giles, ten to one, up a 
tree he is. 
t. James, & c. 
Period St. James has an appetite puzzling, 
Period St. Giles, happy tight is when guzzling; 
Period St. James cuts a 
shine, nothing lacking, 
Period St. Giles maAys a 
shine by shoe blacking. 
Period St. James curry flavors his chicken up, 
Period St. Giles curries favor—debts sticking up ; 
Period St. James takes fresh air in famed Rotten-row, 
Period St. Giles takes fresh herriny with shotten-row ! 
St. James, dic. 
[1] 
23. 
ST. 
JAMES AND ST. 
GILES, 
&C.— CONCLUDED. 
Period St. James music has on his tables, 
Period St. Giles gets Mews-sick over stables, 
Period St. James often utters things curious, 
Period St. Giles often utters tin spurious. 
St. James takes in cards of swell West-end perfumers, 
St. Giles with curds takes in his pal beer consumers; 
St. James goes to warm baths, of health a 'supporter, 
St. Giles goes to Coldbath, getting into hot water 1 
St. James, & c. 
St. James walking in the " Zoo " with a 
clique, daily is, 
St. Giles walking into Sue with a 
stick daily is ; 
St. James has a 
nice carte de viste that pleases, 
St. Giles as 0(n)-ice cart at ponds when it freezes. 
Miss Period St. James does the " Grecian Bend" haughty, 
Miss Period St. Giles stoops to many things naughty; 
Miss St. James the " Can- can " dance won't deign to ap-
pear in it, 
Miss St. Giles likes the " Public" can-can, with some beer 
in it. 
St. James, & c. 
St. James makes his toilet, awl makes up with rich rai-
ment, 
St. Giles makes his mind up to make no rent payment ; 
Which Period St. James has his Fete which all glitter is, 
And poor Period St. Giles has his Fate, which all bitter is, 
Well, so wags the world, and while Time holds the hour-
glass, 
There will be a 
high class, and must be a 
lower class; 
And maybe, St. Giles, when he lies, a 
non- feeder, down, 
Rests happier far, than St. James on his eider down.

Pray take this rose, this snow-white rose, 
And from it never part, 
Although the gift's but humble, still 
'IT-s 
from a 
faithful heart. 
Yes, wear it in thy bosom fair, 
"Ds purity, you see, 
And when ' tis faded, think of him 
That fondly gave it thee. 
Pray take this rose, this snow-white rose, 
And with it never part, 
Although the gift's but humble, still 
from a

Pray take this rose, this snow-white rose, 
It may bring thee relief, 
I 
pluck'd it early but this morn, 
The dew-bead on its leaf; 
And tho' sweet flow'r of fragrance rare, 
Must wither and decay, 
Not so the love for thee I 
bear, 
it ne'er can fade away. 
Pray take this rose, &c.

SWEET THOUGHTS OF THEE. 
Dearest love, I 
see thine image 
In each sunbeam in each cloud, 
In the streandet, in the ocean, 
lit the forest's dark green shroud. 
And thy voice still sweetly W h 
ispers, 
In the gentle summer breeze, 
As it sigt:s in softly passing 
Thro' the dear old forest trees. 
(Repeat) 
And thy voice, &c 
Thu' far distant from the true heart, 
That beats alone for thee, 
Net a 
single moment passes 
That from thought of thee is free, 
Then, dearest love pray hasten 
From that distant land away, 
And return, the heart to cheer, love, 
That front thee will never stray. 
(Repeat) 
Then, dearest love, & c.

PRETTY MISS RICKETTS, THE GROCER'S MAID. 
Oh! a 
sadly pitiful story's mine, 
Just listen, and you shall hear, 
flow naughty Miss Ricketts, the Grocer's maid, 
Once treated her swain so dear; 
For I 
fancied her heart was mine, and thought 
how happy we both should be. 
Oh ! naughty Miss Ricketts, the Grocer's maid, 
flow badly you treated me! 
CHORUS. 
So in love—yes, in love! 
So in love with the fairest she, oh ! 
Naughty Miss Ricketts, the Grocer's maid, 
Was all the world to me; 
Oh! naughty Miss Ricketts, the Grocer's maid, 
Was all the world to nic! 
For her eyes were as bright as little stars, 
Ifer manners were kind and frank, 
She said she'd a 
couple of building shares, 
And cash in the Savings Bank ; 
She looked like an angel in cotton print, 
Weighing up sugar and tea, 
Oh! naughty Miss Ricketts, the Grocer's maid, 
flow badly you treated me! 
So in love, ike 
One blissful night, ' twas her Sunday out, 
She promised that she'd be mine, 
how little I 
thought on that moonlit night. 
Her fortune was all moonshine ; 
But I 
married her soon, and found I'd got, 
Instead of' a 
fortune small, - 
With pretty Miss Ricketts, the Grocer's maid, 
A temper, and—that was all! 
So in love. Scc. 
She grumbles and scolds from morning till night 
I 
fancy I 
hoar her now ! 
'Us the voice of my dear angelic spouse, 
I 
must go or there'll be a 
row. 
All you wkw would wed for money, take care, 
That first the money you see, 
And think of Miss Ricketts, the Grocer's maid, 
And how she behaved to me! 
For I 
was so in love, & e. 
24 
I 
LOVE HIM MORE THAN I CAN SAY. 
Only an angel's eye can see 
The holy throbbing,s of her breast. 
Who, in her youth, loves fervently, 
An I 
knows the future to be blest. 
In his true heart sic finds a 
throne, 
And reigns alone ! then, day by day, 
Daring, with modest pride, to own— 
" 
I 
love hint more than I 
can say." 
Thus, one by one, pass happy years, 
Endearing, as they onward move ; 
E'en sorrow scarcely stirs her fears, 
Eturtbled by such princely love 
But the solemn messenger, called Death, 
Bears him with sudden haste away :— 
She pleads. with failing head and breath— 
" 
I 
love him more than I 
can say." 
A struggle ! then a 
holier fire ! 
Her soul has found it's heavenward wings, 
And meet: his love, translated higher, 
In the palace of the Kin; of Kings, 
The parting sorrow has nass'd by— 
She kneels, with yearning heart to pray, 
Breathing to greet his soul on high— 
" 
I 
love him more than I 
can say." 
FAIR STARS OF NIGHT. 
Fair stars of night. in cloudless skies ; 
Ye gems of Ht av'n so bright, 
My lady's clos'd her weary eyes, 
Watch o'er my love to- night. 
Oh skies oh skies of blue afar, 
That beam with orbs so rare, 
Ye bosom not a 
lovelier star 
Than is my lady fair. 
Fair stars of night, whose rays so clear 
Thu no both Itnd a- d 
sea, 
Oh toll ice if my lady dear 
Is dreaming e'er of me ? 
Bright blossoms of a 
boundless space, 
T 
will thy vigils share. 
goki-n sunshine takes thy place. 
A 41 wakes my lady fair.

SIR, ROBERT DE BEARD; 
OR, 
THE NEW REGULATION BOBBY 
Behold in me a 
modern man, 
Who stands A. 1. in London; 
I'm not a 
Peeler fond of a 
cram, 
Nor Jo I 
shout out " Move on." 
I'm call'd Sir Robert de Beard, 
By the West-end population; 
By the small fry I 
am fear'd, 
Throughout the British Nation. 
Spoken.— 
Yes, you see in me a 
noble specimen of a 
Metrollo-
papan Constable. 
CHORUS. 
They call me Sir Robert de Beard, 
By all the small fry I 
am fear'd, 
In my hair there's a 
charm, and my manners is calm, 
So they call me Sir Robert de Beard. 
My manly form creates surprise, 
In ev'ry form that passes; 
A 
swell, they say, but in disguise. 
And quiz me through their glasses. 
For kitchen maids and all that kind, 
De Beard's euntempt is dire; 
Fat cooks may suit a 
common mind, 
I 
look a 
little higher. 
Spoken — I 
ham more refined in my tastes—the Horse Marines 
will find no rival in me. 
They call me, & c. 
No doubt, some day. I 
shall obtain, 
As a 
reward of merit; 
The place of late Sir Richard Mayne. 
Whose talent I 
inherit. 
A 
great M. P., perchance I'll be, 
If I 
sustain my pecker; 
I 
see a 
post cut out for me, 
As Chancellor of th' Exchequer. 
Spoken.—When I 
do get into the House they'll have all their 
work to get me out of the House, I 
shall round upon all them 
Lambs of Beales if they wants to rub the paint hoff them new 
gilt railings round Hyde Park, I've got my heye on 'em. 
They call me, (kn.

COME OVER THE FERRY. 
Come over the ferry, and let us be merry, 
The boat is now waiting for thee, 
The stream is fast flowing, the May buds are blowing, 
Come over the ferry to me. 
The hedge-rows are laden with blossoms dear, maiden, 
And sweetly their perfume is scenting the air ; 
The choicest and rarest, the richest and fairest, 
weave in a 
garland to twine in thy hair, 
The church bells are pealing, ancl sweetly is stealing 
O'er meadows, their music so clear; 
Then hear what I'm saying have no more delaying, 
Come over the ferry, my dear. 
CHORUS. 
Come over the ferry, and let us be merry, 
The boat is now waiting for thee, 
The stream is fast flowing the May-buds are blowing, 
Come over the ferry to me. 
Come over the ferry, and let us be merry, 
When birds sweetly sing on the tree, 
When earth's full of gladness, we'll banish all sadness, 
Come over the ferry to me. 
Filen come, gentle lady, the lanes cool and shady 
Are shelter'd by hedges of blossoming May; 
COME OVER THE FERRY.— W ONCLUDED. 
*So pleasant for walking, and if we are talking? 
The birds and the trees only hear what we say, 
The day is fast flying, the buds will be dying, 
The song-birds no more will you hear, 
The ev'ning is splendid, then come ere ' tis ended, 
Come over the ferry my dear, 
Come over the ferry, and let us be merry, 
The boat is now waiting for thee, 
The stream is fast flowing, the May buds are blowing, 
; Come over the ferry to me. 
Come over the ferry, and let us be merry, 
The first little star I 
can see, 
Which seems to be saying, " Oh! cease this delaying, 
Come over the ferry to me." 
The moon will be showing, the wind will be blowing, 
The air will be chill with the breezes of night, 
And here sad and lonely, I'm waiting you only, 
While time, ever busy, is taking his flight ; 
At last I 
can see her, I 
know it must be her, 
An end to my doubt and my fear; 
You're coming at last then, my vigil is past then, 
Come over the ferry my dear, 
Come ove, ate ferry, anu let us be merry, 
The boat is now waiting for thee, 
The stream is fast flowing, the May buds are blowing, 
Come over the ferry to me.

THE DEAR OLD LAND I'M LEAVING. 
Dear old land I'm leaving, 
home of boyhood's days, 
On thy fields and homesteals, 
Fondly do I 
gaze; 
Happy days I've pass'd here, 
Come back again to my mind, 
Dear old land I'm leaving— 
Leaving far behind. 
CHORUS, 
Fondly cherish'd, fondly 
Wheresoe'er I 
rove, 
Dear old land I'm leaving, 
Dear old land I 
love. 
Lands perchance are fairer, 
Far across the sea, 
But the land I'm leaving, 
is so fair to me ; 
Skies they say aro brighter, 
In those far-off parts, 
But I 
leave behind me 
Tender, loving hearts. 
Fondly cherished, &c. 
Thoughts of thee will cheer me, 
Thro' the dreary day, 
And my heart be with thee, 
Though I'm far away ; 
Back to thee bow often 
Will my mem'ry roam, 
And at night in dreaming, 
I 
shall see my home. 
Fondly cherished, &c. 
THE GIRL IN ADVANCE OF THE TIMES. 
The " Girls of the Period" have all had their say, 
And we've had enough of the ‘• Young men of the day !" 
But neither of the parties with my fancy chimes, 
Because I'm a 
girl in advance of my times. 
CHORUS. 
I 
can sing. I 
can sew, 
I 
can ride I 
can row, 
I 
can cook, I 
can nurse, 
So for better or worse, 
I'm a 
girl in advance of my times. 
I 
can act a 
charade, play billiards or pool, 
Can serve up a

I'm the pet of the house, the pride of the " Row,"

I 
can sing, & e, 
BENEATH THE SNOW. 
Under the snow the gritss is green, 
Though hidden from our oyes awhile, 
The tiny plants are sleeping too, 
Till spring awakes them with her smile; 
They snugly lie till suushinos glow, 
Under the snow, under the snow. 
Our dearest thoughts, our brightest hopes, 
Lie hidden thus thro' winter's frost, 
Though deeply buried in the snow, 
They are not altogether lost; 
They'll come agaiu with spring, although 
Like flow'rs they sleep, under the snow. 
Tho' winter seems so bleak and long, 
The' snow be falling thick and fast, 
From out the clouds so dark and drear, 
The vfolden sun will break at last; 
When birds will sing, and flow'rs will blow, 
The' they all lie under the snow, 
29 
Brightly, clearly ring the convent bells, 
What soft cadence on the echo dwells, 
To the hillocks, to the silent dells, 
Floating high their dulcet music swells. 
As unto silence the chimes fade away, 
They proclaim the close of weary day; 
Like sparkling gems of wondrous light, 
The stars begin to stud the sky— 
Sweet harbingers of the coming night, 
They tell the herdsman rest is nigh. 
CHORUS. 
On his ear, sweet and clear, 
Fall the convent bells, 
Gone's the day, is the lay 
Of the silver bells. 
Bells are swinging in the belfry tow'r, 
Hymns and chiming mingle at this hour, 
Nuns are praying in the convent cells, 
Ring on, sweetly ring on. silver bells. 
Oh ! what a 
world of happiness you bring, 
With your merry notes, your golden ring, 
The lonely wand'rer lost his way, 
The path, alas! is hard to find, 
lie hears your sweet enchaaing lay 
Borne on the balmy summer air, 
On his ear, sweet and clear, 
Fall the convent bells. 
" 
Found's the way," is the lay 
Of the silver bells. 
31 
ALL LIKE FADED FLOW'RS ARE GONE. 
The dream has pass'd, the spell is broken, 
hopes have fallen one by one, 
The whisper'd words—so sweetly spoken, 
All like faded tlow'rs are gone. 
Still her voice in music lingers, 
Like a 
harp whose silver strings, 
Softly swept by fairy fingers, 
Tell of unforgotten things. 
The dream, &c. 
In the music's saauen'd measure, 
Dead delights and dying dreams 
Live again, and perishd pleasure, 
Wake from death in golden gleams. 
Tho' by love and hope forsaken, 
Tho' by sorrow overcast, 
Yet will memory awaken 
Sleeping shadows of the past. 
The dream, &c. 
A FATHER'S LOVE.' 
The nectar cup may yield delight, 
The heart sweet music move, 
But, oh! no charm, however bright, 
Is like paternal love. 
Affection wears a 
silken chain, 
O'er deserts though we rove, 
It gently draws us back again— 
Each link a 
father's love. 
It gently draws us back, &c. 
Yes! like the balm of op'nitig fiow'rs, 
Across the ocean foam. 
It floats with us to distant shores, 
it pilots back our home. 
Alas P 
how oft, in later years, 
Though changed the heart may prove, 
Doth mem'ry's dream recall, thro' tears, 
A father's early love. 
Doth menery's dream, Sze.

FIRE-WORKS ON THE BRAIN; 
I 
met a 
little girl while walking, 
Oh I 
wasn't it nice ! 
Soou we commenced our talking, 
Now gents, take my advice; 
For this little girl that I 
met, 
Although it was in the rain, 
She looked at me so very cool, 
Yet she had fire-works on the brain! 
CHORUS. 
Yes, up they go in the air, boys, 
As fast as the lightning train; 
This little girl that I 
met, 
had fire-works on the brain. 
I 
made an appointment for the next day, 
Oh I 
wasn't it nice! 
To go to the Crystal Palace— 
It's true upon my life ; 
We left that very day early, 
By the nine G. M. train, 
" 
Shall we see them to- night, dear r " Yes!" 
She had fire-works on the brain. 
Yes, up they go, &c. 
"Your name?" she says ' Lucinda.' 
Oh! wasn't it nice! 
"You naughty, cheeky little man, now, 
Just take my advice; 
Have you ever been to Cremorne, 
That's a 
place for a 
lark, 
The lire- works are such jolly fun, 
You can see them in the dark." 
Yes, up they go, &e. 
I 
put my arm around her, 
Oh ! wasn't it nice ! 
Then I 
squeezed her little hand, 
I 
did, I 
kissed her twice; 
Since then I 
have married Lucinda. 
Of my lot I'll not complain. 
We have got a 
little boy and girl, both marked 
With fire-works on the brain.

I 
have made it my rule, since the day I 
was born, 
To treat ev'ry ttouble and bother with scorn, 
And I 
pass thin' this world in an indolent way, 
Mixing with either the quiet or gay. 
All society's rules I 
strictly defy, 
To save myself worry I 
always vill try, 
Studiously meaning myself first to please, 
Taking things easy, boys. taking my ease. 
CHORUS. 
Taking my ease, taking my ease, 
Doing whatever I 
happen to please; 
Taking my ease, taking my ease, 
Taking things easy, boys, taking my ease. 
I 
have found out ' tis well that I 
riches possess, 
They win for me many a 
smile and caress. 
And ev'ry sweet damsel that I 
chance to see, 
Conjures a 
smile as a 
welcome to me. 
Of course the dear creatures I 
greatly admire, 
Tho' I 
scarcely can do the one thing they require, 
For marriage to ev'ry detail disagrees 
taking things easy, boys, taking my ease. 
Taking my ease & o. 
To balls or to routs why I 
never can go, 
For I 
look on such things as remarkably slow, 
And all of them seem with each other in league, 
Trying how they can a 
fellow fatigue. 
Billiards and Pool I 
just tolerate, 
And sometimes in Wintet I 
fancy a 
skate, 
The girls often chaff m':  and say I 
shall freeze, 
Taking things easy, boys, taking my ease. 
Taking my ease, &c. 
I 
ever endeavor to " Act on the square !" 
Doing the thing that is manly and fair, 
Tinning my back on all pi ejadice, pride, 
Caring for nought Nrhat'er may betide, 
Giving to others what I 
can afford, 
Instead of preferring my spare gold to.board ; 
Pas-ing fine' life, as ev'ryone sees, 
Taking things easy, boys, taking my ease. 
Takiug my ease, &e. 
NOT TO-DAY, BAKER. 
I 
stand just like a 
timid bird, 
To sing this song upon my word, 
I 
wrote it— that may seem absurd-
But I'm a 
song-maker. 
Then gentlemen and ladies, too, 
List to a 
tale— so strange but true ; 
The subject is, ' twixt me and you— 
Spoken—Not to-day, Baker! 
One day, whirst walking Regent stree 
A charming lady I 
did meet, 
%VIA), with a 
smile so soft and sweet, 
Asked me if I'd tak'er 
To iam'd Cremorne, ' twould be so fine, 
Glorious dinner—lovely wine I 
I 
calmly shook this head of mine, 
Spoken—Not to- day, Baker. 
Whilst talking. I 
did quickly spy, 
A man behind, whose hand did pry 
Into my pocket, rather sly— 
Impudent cly faker! 
His hand in seizing, I 
somehow 
Did stand upon the fellow's toe, 
He cried out " Murder! let me go," 
Spoken—Not to-day, Baker' 
I 
once did owe a 
lot of tin, 
My victims kicked up such a 
din, 
I 
thought 
nicely take them in— 
I 
meant to give a 
shaker, 
I 
got up in the dead of night, 
Got my goods outside all right, 
When a 
man in blue appeared in sight-
Spoken—Not to-day, Baker! 
Some time ago, I 
courting went 
You'd never guess to what extent, 
My coin upon a 
girl I 
spent, 
But mine I 
thought to make her, 
[1] 
NOT TO-DAY, 
BAKER. [CONCLUDED 
One night, said I 
to her, " My dear, 
Will you be mine ? my love sincere." 
She softly whisper'd in mine ear— 
Spoken—Not to-day, Baker! 
I 
fled from that sequester'd spot, 
My blood turn'd cold and then turn'd hot 
I 
thought of death ! then like a 
shot, 
Wrote to an undertaker. 
A pool of water met my view, 
To certain death then off I 
flew, 
I 
rushed head-long, then up I 
drew, 
Spoken—Not to-day, Baker! 
In a 
public house, that very night, 
A man there wanted me to fight; 
He punch'd my nose with all his might, 
My stars! it was a 
shaker. 
Re knock'd me down upon the floor, 
And kiek'd me till he made me roar, 
Then ask'd me it I'd like some more, 
.Spoken—Not to-day, Baker! 
Some time ago, by accident, 
Into a 
wrong bed-room I 
went; 
A 
girl was sleeping quite content, 
And meaning not to wake her, 
I 
lean'd across this fair one's bed, 
To try to kiss her lips so red, 
When her eyes she opened as she said— 
Spoken—Not to-day, Baker! 
As every song must have an end, 
This, the last verse I 
intend ; 
I've said enough, you may depend— 
So thinks this wiseacre. 
I 
like things short, altho' I'm long, 
So it you think that to this song, 
There's another verse, you'll be quite wrong. 
Spoken—Not to-day, raker I

MUSIC HATH CHARMS. 
Some say that " music bath charms 
To soothe the savage breast ?" 
I've also heard some people say 
That " enough is as good as a 
feast." 
Now I 
once paid court to a 
maid, 
I've stuck to her like gum. 
But she went music mad. alas ! 
Through her violent taste for the drum. 
CHORUS. 
Some like the Jews'-harp. some like the flute. 
Others the piano, with its strum, strum, strum. 
While some prefer the fiddle, with its twiddle, twiddle, 
twiddle. 
While Sarah Jane was partial to the drum, drum, drum. 
Said Sarah to me one day, 
For mush.; I've an ear, 
I 
wish. dear Charles you'd learn to play !" 
Said I, 
I 
'
will my dear." 
So I 
rushed out and purchased a 
fiddle, 
A double bass, and a 
bassoon, 
And labored each day trying to play 
Where's Nancy ?" " Up in a 
M11 oon ?" 
Some like the Jew'-harp, &e. 
I 
blew, and twiddled, and scraped. 
I 
thought I 
should please her so fine, 
I 
scraped, and I 
twiddled, and blew 
Idyself near into a 
decline 
I 
II 
MUSIC RATH CHARMS. [CONCLUDED. 
When one day as we walked in the Park, 
Out the band of Coldstreams did come ; 
Guess how I 
stared, when Sarah declared, 
No music so sweet as the drum." 
Sonic like the Jews'-harp, &e. 
Of course I 
felt staggered at first, 
But ran out and bought a 
drum too, 
And every day I'd bang, hang away 
Until stopped by a 
party in blue! 
Yes, I'd practice the beats every day, 
Even played the tatoo whilst in bed ; 
Folks fancied me mad, but the truth to tell sad, 
Poor Sarah went cranky inst ad. 
Some like the Jews'-harp, &e. 
Alt ! yes, she went clean oft her nut. 
Which translated, means acted so rum, 
When I 
went her to see she began to beat me— 
She fancied that I 
was a 
druin. . 
So what may soothe some savage breasts, 
Ifas not turned out soothing to me 
And music although the " food of love," - 
With Sarah Jane did not agree. 
Some like the Jews'-harp, some like the flute, 
Others the piano, with its strum, strum, strum, 
• 
While some prefer the fiddle, with its twiddle, twiddle,

While Sarah Jane was partial to the drum, druni, drum.

WHEN TRE COCK BEGINS TO CROW. 
Many sluggards 1 
have seen, 
Of many I 
have read. 
Who waste away their precious time, 
By being fond of bed. 
But if you would take my advice, 
You'll find it good and true, 
How to gain both health and wealth, 
I'll quickly tell to you. 
CHORUS. 
Jump out of bed, jump out of bed, 
Lying long looks lazy, 
If the morn be wet or dry, 
Or if it should be hazy, 
Light or dark, get up with the lark, 
Don't care for frost or snow, 
Jump out of bed, jump out of bed , 
When the cock begins to crow. 
I 
never saw a 
lazy man 
I 
could depend upon, 
I 
never saw a 
lazy man 
Who ever did get on; 
Idle and inactive, they 
Will lie in bed all day, 
For they prefer—just like the sloth, 
To sleep their time away. 
Jump out of bed, &c. 
I 
love to see the farm ,x, 
In the fields at early morn, 
He -looks so gay and happy, 
As he works among the corn; 
Early off to bed lie goes, 
Too long he never sleeps, 
For well he knows the adage, 
He must " sow before he reaps." • 
Jump out of bed, &c. 
So if you would be healthy, wealthy, 
Prosperous, and Wise, 
Never lie in slumber \\lien 
The sun is in the skies; 
Spend your ev'nings soberly, 
Don't stay out too late, 
Be early up to sow the seed 
And your harvest will be groat. 
Jump out of bed, dze.

I'LL FIND A WAY OR MAKE IT 
I'
LL FIND A WAY OR MAKE IT.—[CONCLUDED. 
Written for HAIM' CLIFTON. 
It was a 
noble Roman, 
In Rome's Imperial day; 
Who heard a 
coward croaker 
Before the castle say, 
"They're safe in such a 
fortress, 
There is no way to shake it ;" 
"On. on ! ' exclaimed the hero, 
" 
I'll find a 
way or make it." 
CHORUS. ' 
So in this world as we're traveling throng 
Troubles and trials we all see a 
few, 
We must not give up as some people do, 
But " find it or make a 
way through." 
Is Fame your aspiration— 
Her path is steep and high, 
In vain he seeks her temple, 
Content to gaze and sigh. 
The shining throne is waiting, 
But he alone can take it; 
Who says, with Roman firmness, 
" 
I'll 'find a 
way or make it." 
So in this, dio 
Is learning your ambition, 
There is no royal rcad ; 
Alike to Peer or Peasant, 
Must ciimb to her abode. 
Who feels the thirst of knoll ledge, 
In Helicon may slake it— 
If he has still the Roman will 
To " find a 
way or make it." 
So in this, &c. 
Are riches worth the getting, 
They must be bravely sought; 
With wishing and with fretting, 
The boon cannot be bought. 
To all the prize is open, 
But he alone can take it ; 
Who says with Roman courage, 
" 
I'll find a 
way or make it," 
So in this, dre„ 
In love's impassioned warfare, 
The tale has ever been; 
That victory crowns the valiant, 
The brave are those that win. 
Though strong is Beauty's castle, 
A 
lover still may take it; 
Who says with Roman daring, 
"I'll find a 
way or make it." 
So in this, dm

Ob, pretty swallow, homeward fly, 
Bird of passage swiftly hie, 
-Unto my lov'd one miles away, 
Whose love for inc will ne'er decay. 
Around thy neck this message bear, 
Swiftly o'er the deep blue sea ; 
And when the summer comes again, 
My pretty bird come back to me I 
How gladly I 
will welcome thee. 
CHORUS. 
Pretty swallow, homeward fly, 
Bird of passage swiftly hie ; 
Unto my lov'd one miles away, 
Whose love for me will ne'er decay. 
Oh, pretty swallow, while thou'rt gone, 
This fond heart will weep alone, 
With fond love and anguish burn, 
Fearing he may ne'er return. 
But oh ! I 
trust when winter's past, 
To hear love's sweet enchanting spell; 
Do fly then quickly tar away, 
My bonnie bird, " good-bye! farewell !" 
how gladly I 
will welcome thee. 
Prett'y swallow, jzc. 
Alt! now you've left me sad and lone ; 
In my humble cottage home, 
I'll wander silent-down the lane, 
Whet e 
soon I'll meet my love again. 
At night I'll pray for happier days, 
When blooming is the hedge and tree; 
And when the summer comes again, 
My love and bird will come to me ; 
How gladly I 
will welcome thee.

And as the proverb tells us, I

is to let other folks go first! 
Yes, after me, 
et, 
After me, after me, for greediness don't thirst, 
After me, yes, after me, and then you shall be first. 
Whilst walking out the other day, I

A 
sad young dog was William Winks, 
lie had a 
way of slyly winking; 
Whene'er a 
pretty girl he met. 
Now this was very wrong I'm thinking. 
As years roll'd on this habit grew, 
Until at length great fears possess'd him; 
As o'er his winks he'd lost control, 
His future prospects much oppress'd him. 
Wink, wink, wink! 
CHORUS, 
William Winks could not help winking, 
Whether talkino• whether thinking, 
Whether eating, whether drinking, 
William Winks could not help winking. 
When away from danger shrinking, 
Heart within him almost sinking, 
Oft he had to run like winking, 
Poor William Winks 
He gave his heart to Patty Prim, 
And as they walked along one Sunday, 
He p 
ess'd her so to " name the day "— 
She blush'd and whisper'd, 
Say next Monday." 
When Monday came they went to Church, 
And all went well until the bride said— 
When ask'd if she wmild " take this man ?" 
"No, no! he's winking at ray bridesmaid." 
Wink, wink, wink!

Who seiz'd him by the throat and shook him. 
Poor Winks gasp'd out, tho' almost chok'd, 
" 
Oh I 
do you wish to take my life, sir ?" 
"You bare- faced scamp," the man replied, 
"How dare you wink thus at my wife, sir ?" 
Wink, wink, wink!

Poor Winks then gave the man in charge, 
Before the Court next day appearing; 
He stepp'd into the witness box, 
For his sad tale to get a 
hearing. 
The Mayor roar'd out, " What ? wink at me! 
To act like this I

This man's discharg'd, but for contempt 
Of court, to jail I

how much poor William Winks has suffer'd; 
And I've no doubt that you begin 
To think that you have quite enough heard.

Don't wink too much, you may repent it; 
For you, like Winks, in course of time, 
May not be able to prevent it. 
Wink, wink, wink !

GO TO PUTNEY. 
There was a 
King of England once, 
So story tellers tell us; 
Who blew a 
fire to bake some cakes, 
Wit mouth instead of bellows. 
An old Dame warmed King Alfred up, 
As hot and strong as Chutney ; 
And told his Royal Highness then 
That he might " Go to Putney !" 
Spoken. — Yes, ladies and gents, strange as it may appear, Put-
ney was a 
fashionable watering place in the earty ages, so early 
as the days of King Alfred, and the saying " Go to Putney !" is 
to be attributed t.,) that remarkable incident in English history— 
the fact of Alfred the Great seeking refuge in an old woman s 
cottage, after a 
severe battle with the Danes, and as be let some 
cakes burn which the old lady had told him to look carefully 
after, she kicked His Royal Highness out of her cottage, and 
said— 
crionts 
"Go to Putney, go to Putney, 
Go to Putney, on a 
pig, go to Putney—what a 
rig, 
Go to Putney. go to Putney, 
Go to Putney on a 
pig, go to Putney 1" 
I've heard that saying many times, 
By clever men and bores ; 
In England, Ireland, Scotland, Wales, 
Likewise on foreign shores. 
The Frenchman of our Leicester Square, 
lf asked he is to pay ; 
His shoulders shrug, and with a 
lisp, 
'Tis nice to hear him say— 
Go to Putney, &o. 
Some time ago T 
fell in love, 
With such a 
splendid girl; 
She promised Inc that she would be 
Mv wice—my precious pearl. 
I 
made her many gifts, but when 
I 
asked her if she'd wed ; 
She slightly curled her nose, and then— 
Well 1

has locked the garde 
gate. 
Spokoz.—Ah ! 
that's the worst of getting married; it is not 
at all pleasant after you have been enjoying yourself to get home 
tired and drenched with wet ( heavy), to find the gate locked, 
voti ring the bell violently, your wife throws open the bed-room 
wiadow a..d wildly remarks that you may 
Go to Putney, ttc. 
And now I 
think you've had enough 
Of me and of my song ; 
If it has not been much too short, 
I 
hope it's not too long. 
If I 
have earned your kind applause, 
You won't forget to pay ; 
And let me hope amongst my friends, 
Not one of you will say— 
Go to Putney, eirc.

Take the Army List and search it litre, examine ev'ry name, 
And you II not find an Officer eclipsing me in fame, 
For tho' no medals I 
have won—and never shall I 
think, 
I 
am the " Plungers " pet you know, in short I'm Captain Pink. 
Not know me? fie! what, never heard of Captain Pink, its too 
absurd ! 
When scarce a 
Morning lost comes out, but the: e 
my name you 
see., 
There's not a 
night I 
am not out, at Lady Someone's ball or rout, 
And bye-the-bye the routs I 
mean are victories for me.

Take the Army List and search it thro', examine ev'ry name, 
And you'll not find an Officer eclipsing me in fame, 
For tho' no medals I

Ask the ladies they will tell you what a 
man I 
rm to dance, 
How dang'rous 'tis to flirt with me, the dears have not a 
chance, 
You see we military men have manners quite our Own, 
The " Plungers " are invincible in storming Cupid's throne! 
How can the darlings stand this smile ? this killing look- it must 
beguile, 
I've practised it much °Wrier than I 
ever did my drill; 
Then in the valse, a 
gentle squeeze, I 
know the proper way to 
please.

CAPTAIN PINK.—Colicurnm. 
I 
can make my spurs and sabre clank, and give the Royal salute, 
I 
can still retain my war-like ways tho' in my mufti suit; 
The Club chef is afraid of me, I 
make my valet shake, 
And the very waiters tremble, when they ask me what I'll take. 
I 
am a 
judge of wine and weeds, I 
keep a 
pair of matchless steeds, 
And once to serve a 
chum of mine, I 
kept guard at the bank; 
What's more, I 
once was in a 
figkt, a 
sham one—'twas a 
glorious 
sight 
To see me at a 
hay-rick bravely charging down point blank. 
'Fake the, dm 
I 
do not care for cricket much, they bowl so very swift, 
At Croquet I'm invincible, for spooning I've a 
gift; 
I 
also boast strategic skill, I 
bring it into play, 
13y getting supper at a 
ball, tbe crush be what it may. 
I 
am au fait in songs and glees, I'm always good for mild sprees, 
I 
love my little luxuries, and so I 
have no wife 
I 
have a 
sword that's very clear, but would you be surprised to 
hear ? 
I 
never struck a 
blow with it in all my soldier life. 
I'm sure you all must join with me in giving England joy, 
To think, that in her army, she can men like inc employ, 
And reckon on one officer at least who'll never shrink, 
From Fashion's duty calls, you know—your gallant Captain Pink.
