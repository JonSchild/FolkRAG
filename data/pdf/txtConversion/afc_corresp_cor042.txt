Dear Mr. Lomax:
I was much encouraged by your very kind letter. As long as I feel sure that what we're
doing is worthwhile I am ready to work without stint. The interviewers, too, took heart and
will try to guard against repetitions and interruptions.
I am also relieved to know that you anticipate some repairs on the equipment. I returned
two sapphire needles to Dr. Spivacke by registered mail, No. 9950. One was lost and so
we have only one left which we will use as directed.
Stormy weather continues to delay recordings of the shrimp fleet. In the meantime we
are getting stevedore songs of the boats loading railroad ties and unloading bananas.
Incidentally, the porgy (menhaden) fleet has some very distinctive songs which we could
get if we had a transformer to use on the boat. Dr. Spivacke offered us one but I did not
think we needed it then.

Nothing has been heard of the official WPA request for continued use of the machine
forwarded to Washington in September. If it comes, I will try to arrange for Conch
recordings at Palm Beach and Key West.
I am intensely interested in this phase of our work and am glad I can write you for advice.
