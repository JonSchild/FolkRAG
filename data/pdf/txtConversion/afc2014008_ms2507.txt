Dear  VirQina,
 
Fr cm:
 
Hart  Drown ,
 
5390 Brownway St.,
 
Houston,  TX  77O56--49 6.
 
Nov.  24, 1992.
 
Your  most  welcome epistl e arrived  very promptly.
 Someti mes the
 
postal  services likes to keep my mail  a week  or  two.
 But  this
 
time they were on their  toes and  found me despite your  rather
 
antiquated  address.
 We haven't  moved our  house an  inch since it
 
was built  52 years ago.
 But  it' s mailing address is revised and
 
moderni
t
hd  frequently
 
It  is good to know .
that  you are safel y out  of the Haitian
 
turmoil.
 I know you miss your  treasured  friends
 -
-
 carefully
 
collected during a lifeti me.
 But  that  is why we have the memory
 
section of our  brains.
 And since LOVE is cumulative,  we can
 
relive all  those wonderful  lifetime events that  have come our
 
way,  and can  ignore and  forget  the negatives.
 
I have made a Xerox copy of your  letter  so that  I can share it
 
with Shirley.
.  It  will  get  mailed,  along with a copy of thi s,  in a
 
day or  so.
 It  takes a day or  so  for  me to accomplish anything.
 
I loose everything.
 I can  loose my shoes.
 I can search  for  them
 
during  ic
ing  intervals.
 Finally  I locate them right  where  I
 
al ways try to keep them.
 It' s just  a tough old world
 
It  is about  S 0
^  Tuesday morning
 -
-
 I think. ; Now that  I have
 
acquired the venerable ag e  of 90,  I have a valid excuse not  to be
 
sure of  any thing.
 And when  I first  awake the brain  is least
 
fuzzy,  so that  is when  I like to do my writing.
 Note that  I have
 
recorded  your  address and  mine across the top of this page to be
 
retrievable when needed.
.
 
And this  "word processor"  (specific  type of  computer)  is my life
 
saver.
 I c
a
n
 s
i
t
 h er e  with the keyboard  under  my  fingers,  and
 
just  type a storm on  the TV screen  in  front  of me.
 I make a

n
e .
 With this gadget,  I just  b ck
 
up  and type over  the boo-boos,  and they are gone
 
When  I get  a screen  full  of stuff  that  suits me,  I punch a couple
 
of  keys,  and the  "printer"  (another  gadget)  types it  all  out.
 It
 
prints at  break-neck speed.
 It  has a memory.
 So it prints the
 
f
irst  line  from left  to right  (the way a typewriter  does),  then
 
it  reaches into it' s memory and prints the second  line backwards,
 
from right  to left  K
 It  prints a page in about  10 seconds.
 
With this m edi u m  for  c o m m uni c ati on,
 l am retaining a surprising
 
amount  of  my sanity.
 I write to dignitaries.
 Occasionally they
 
reply.
 I realize that  they have trouble reading what  I write
 
because o f my unique ver si on  of how English  should be spell ed.
 
wrote Pros.  Bush how to solve the DRUG problem.
 He ignored my
 
advice -
-
 an d  you see,  drugs are still  ar o un d.
 I told Perot  how
 
to  get  elected.
 He didn't  listen
 and  so he  lost  out.
 
Now  it  is about  4 IM Nccnesday.
 What  happened  to the rest  of
 
yesterday  Y
 Wel l it  took  a c
o
u
p le o
f
 hours  just  to  find 
 the
 
usual  items,
 the  lost  shoes,  the tooth  brush,  the hearing  aid,
 
my eyeq1as es,  etc,  etc.
 I dc  nearly  all  my own  food pr ep ar-cti: n
 
and  c ooking ,
 
And  then there  i s  the cat
.
 I call  her  Ink  Spot
,
 or  Midn i ght
,
 or
 
Dropout
,
 or  Squeaky.
 Squeaky  follows me around  "
m
e
o
w i
n
g
"  
u n t i l I
 
teed  her.
 We meow back  and  forth  to each other.
 It  is
 
surpr isi ng  how r
nu':h communicati on  can be compressed  into an
 
extended  exchange of  meows.
 
Squeaky  is huge,  1
 '
:
'nahaird,  and  beautiful
.
 Squeaky  is  jet  bl act
:
.
 
except  for  a dime sized white pendant  just  over  the adams apple
 
(i f cats have them).
 She showed  up  here about  a year  ago.
 I
 
tried  t o  ignore her,  but  after  a month  I gave up and started
 
feeding her.
 She is someone' s  lost  pet,  for  she is gentle,
 
affectionate,  and house broken.
 But  she  isn't  very smart
 
hence sometimes  I '
:all  her  "dropout'.
 I had  to bat  her  off  the
 
tabl e and  half way across the room 3 times before she got  the
 
idea.
 
Lee di slikes cats.
 Lee and  dropout  just  snarl  at  each other.
 
But  Lee has
 .
jillions of  f
l ower  pots all  around the terrace.
 
Fi eld  rats love to han g-out  and to socialize in such side-walk
 
conven ience spots;  and have
 pestered Lee  for  years.

't  now has devoured all  of  Lee' s rats.
 She is now
 
depl eting  the squirrel  popul ation.
 It  takes her  about  an  hour  to
 
polish off one squirrel.
 After  such a meal,  and after  she has
 
cl eaned  up  the site,  absolutel y nothing remains but  one complete
 
squirrel-tail  neatly  laid  out  on  the lawn.
 
Two years ago,  I had  to give up  living  in  the highrise Lamar
 
Towers,  and moved  back  to our  3-acre original  homesite.
 I am
 
'
:ramn-i
c
-
2d  into the mobile home  located  100  feet  back o
f
 our  brick
 
house we built  52 years ago.
 Lee  lives  in  the brick home.
 Lee
 
and  I get  along  fairl y well  so long as we remain  100  feet  apart
 
'
 percent  of  the ti me.
 Thi s 3 acre homesite has been  for  sale
 
three years now.
 Both of us need  to rid  ourselves of  thi s
 
sponsibi 1: ty

 but  the Houston  real  estate market  is not
 
cL)peratincj.
 
Considerable of my ti me  is commandeered  by the m
a i
n
t
e
n
a
n
c
e
 
demands of this 52 year  old house and 3 acres of  grounds.
 
Walking  behind the lawn mower  (power  propelled)  provides me with
 
needed exercise.
 But  I no longer  can compress myself under  the
 
ki tchen sink,  or  crawl  about  on  the roof.
 Nor  are the hands now
 
strong  enough  to wield  a St ii sc
'n  wrench when pipes spring  leaks.
 
ut  a steady backl og  of  dc-abl e chores is always at  hand.
 
Scsi des pestering our  elected  "public  servants",  I video-tape a

 Having  a boy baby  is  a novelty  in

The standard ability of  babi es to  put  their  toe  in  their  mouth

 I envi ed  them.

 But  John  Ashby appeared  to  be  a

A year  ago,  when  Cynthi a  and  Brad  Da vi s  marri ed,  hi s Houst on
 
empl oyer  the Bank Of  New York,  had  just  pull ed  in  it' s hor n s  by
 
cl osing  all  its branch  offices.
 Fortunatel y they offered  to take
 
Brad  to New York.
 Now the newl yweds reside  in a
 
little-small -tiny cubicl e  in  Brookl yn.
 But  last  April  the  Bank
 
rewarded  Brad  with  promoti on  to a vice presidency.
 We ar e  luc k y
 
in  that  he comes to Houston  frequentl y to  ser vi c e  the bank' s

 And  Ll?NY hEs  :rc

Nov.  24,
 
Your  most  welcome epi stle arrived  very promptly.
 Sometimes the
 
postal  services  likes to keep my mail  a week or  two.
 But  this
 
time they were on  their  toes and  found  me despite your  rather
 
antiquated  address.
 We haven't  moved our  house an  inch since it
 
was built  52 y
e a r s
 a qi:'.
 But  it' s mailing  address is revised  and
 
moderni
éd  frequently
 
it  is good to know that  you are safel y out  of  the Haitian

 carefully
 
collected  during a lifeti me.
 But  that  is why we have the memory
 
s e c t i
o n
 of  our  brains.
 And since LOVE  is cumulative,  w
e  c a n
 
relive all  t h o s e
 w
o n d e r ful  lifetime events that  have come our
 
way,  and can  ignore and  forget  the n
e g a t i
v e s.
 
I have made a Xerox copy of your  letter  so that  I can share it
 
with Shirl ey.  It  will  get  mailed,  al ong with a
 '
: c' p y
 of thi s,  in a
 
day or  so.
 It  takes a day or  s

I loose everything.
 I can  loose my shoes.
 I can search  for  them
 
during  long  intervals.
 Finally  I locate them right  where  I
 
always try to  keep them.
 It' s just  a tough old world
 
It  i s
 about  S A. M.  Tuesday morning
 -
-
 I think.
 Now that  I have
 
acquired B e venerable age of 90,  I have a valid excuse not  to be
 
sure of  any thing.
 And when  I first  awake the brain  is least
 
fuzzy,  so that  i s  when  I like to do my writing.
 Note that  I have
 
recorded your  address and  m i
n e
 a c r
o s s
 the t o p
 o f
 t h i
s  page t o  be
 
retrievable when needed.
 
And this  "word p r o c

" 
( s p e c i

 life
 
saver.
 I can sit  here with the keyboard  under  my  fingers,  and

 the TV screen  in  front  of  me.
 I make a t
 
least  two typing errors per  line.  With this gadget,  I just  back
 
up  and t y p e  o
v e r
 the boo-boos,  and they are gone
 
When  I get  a screen  full  of stuff  that  suits me,  I punch a couple
 
of  keys,  and the  " p r i

 He ignored my
 
advice -

 and you see,  drugs are still  around.
 I told Perot  how

 He didn't  listen

 Well  it  took  a couple of  hours  just  to  find  tne
 
usual  items,
 the  lost  shoes,  the tooth  brush,  the hearing  aid ,
 
my eyeglasses,  etc,  etc.
 I dc  nearly all  my own  food preparation
 
and  cooking ,
 
And  then  there  is  the '
:at.
 I call  her  in:  Spot,  or  Midnight,  or
 
Dropout
,
 or  Squeaky.
 Squeaky  fol lows me around  "meowing"  unt i l I
 
teed  her.
 We meow back and  forth  to each c
'ther
 
.It  is
 
surpr ising how much communi cati on can be compressed  into an
 
extended  exc h an g e  of  me o ws.
 
Squeaky  is huge,  1
 c
unghai rd,  and  beautiful.
 Squeaky is  jet  hi a: k
 
except  for  a di me sized white pendant  just  over  the adams apple
 
(
if  cats have them).
 She showed  up  here about  a year  ago.
 I
 
tried to ignore her,  but  after  a month  I gave up and started
 
feeding  her.
 She is someone' s  lost  pet,  for  she  is gentle,
 
Sf fect i
 onate,  and house broken.
 But  she  isn't  vary smart
 
hence sometimes  I '
:all  her  "dropout".
 I had  to bat  her  off  the
 
table and  half  way across the room 3 times 
 before she qc
't  the
 
idea.
 
Lee dislikes cats.
 Lee and  dropout  just  snarl  at  each  other.
 
But  Lee has
 •j
i ii ions of  flower  pots all  around the terrace.
 
Fi eld  rats love to hang-out  and t o  soc ialize in  such side-walk
 
convenience spots;  and have
 pestered Lee  for  years.
 
Dl ackspot  now has devoured  all  of  Lee' s rats.
 She is now
 
depicting the squirrel  populat ion.
 It  takes her  about  an  hour  to
 
polish c
uff one squirrel.
 After  such a meal,  and  after  she has
 
cl eaned up the site,  absolutel y nothing remains but  one complete
 
squirrel-tail  neatly  laid out  on  the lawn.
 
Two years ago,  I had  to give up  living  in  the hiqhrise Lamar
 
Towers,  and moved  back to our  3-acre ori gi nal  hc
'mesi te.
 I am
 
'
:rammed  into the mobile home  located  100  feet  back of our  brick
 
house we built  52 years ago.
 Lee  lives  in  the brick home.
 Lee
 
and  I get  along  fairly well  so long  as we remain  100  feet  apart
 
:5 percent  of  the ti me.
 Thi s 3 acre homesite has been  for  sale
 
three years now.
 Both o f  us need  to rid ourselves of  thi s
 
responsibility
 -

-
 but  the Houston  real  estate mar ket  is not
 
uouper ati ng .
 
Considerable of my ti me  is commandeered  by the maintenance
 
demands of  this 52 year  old house and 3 acres of  grounds.
 
Walking behind the lawn mower  (power  propelled)  provides me with
 
needed exercise.
 But  I no  longer  can compress myself under  the
 
kitchen sink,  or  crawl  about  on  the roof.
 Nor  are the hands now
 
strong  enough  to wield  a Sti 1
 son wrench when pipes spring  leaks.
 
But  a steady backl og of  do-able chores is always at  hand.
 
Besides pestering our  el ected  "public  servants",  I video-tape c
a
 
lot  of  TV programs.
 An  extensi ve  library has now accumulated.  I
 
have two video tape recorders,  so  I edit  the tapes extensively.

Faison  (age 4)
now has a baby brother,  John Ashby.
 Lynn  and  John
 
both  are essential  segments of  Walter' s Texc
ui 1
 ,
 so grandma Betty
 
is now a frequent  baby sitter.
 Having  a bay baby  is a novelty  in
 
the Brown/Williams  famil y .

 When  I try  it,  t

whole  f

't  always goes  in.
 But  John Ashby appeared  to be a
 
modern  improvement.
 No toe  in hi s mouth.
 We all  became
 
concerned.
 Could the baby be a genet ic  delinquent
 T
i:
' our
 
great  relief,  Lynn returned  from the pediatrician,  having  learned
 
that  only girl  babies are limber  enough  t o  bite a toe.
 
The USA oi l business conti nues on the decline.
 The Major
 
compani es are choosing  t o  go abroad t o  find new production.
 i
':,
 
Walter  and his Texci 1 Company are developing  a subsidiary  in
 
Argentina.
 It  involves selling stock  t o
 the public,  always an
 
iffy procedure.
 IF  it  works out,  John and Lynn expect  t o  live
 
the next  several  'car e  in  Buenos Aires.
 We  should  know about
 
March.
 
A year  ago,  when  Cynthi a and  Brad  Davis married,  his Houston
 
empl oyer  the Bank Of New York,  had  just  pulled  in  it' s horns by
 
'
;
:lc
usinq  all  its branch  offices.
 Fortunately they offered  to take
 
Br ad  to New York.
 Now the newl yweds reside  in a
 
little-small-tiny cubicl e  in  Brooklyn.
 But  last  April  the Bank
 
rewarded  Brad with promoti on  t o  a vice presidency.
 We are luc Ly
 
in  that  he u

client s here.
 And  BONY has  prospered .  It  now  is  one of  the
 
st ronger  NY): banks.
 
My health  seems to be abnormall y good.
 No worthwhi le organs are
 
mi sbehaving.
 Just  normal  wear-and-tare along with some standard
 
arthritis.
 The back does a gc
'c
'd deal  of  complaining,  and  is
 
joi ned  by the  knees sometimes.
 Two months ago my second cataract
 
was  repl aced  by an  implant  lens.  I need  glasses  for  di stance,  but
 
read  better  without  them.
 
I can  still  drive  my  Iit:

 My shaky  right  hand is

 A spoon  full  of  soup  departs
 
the dish  intact.  but  fails to reach  the mouth.
