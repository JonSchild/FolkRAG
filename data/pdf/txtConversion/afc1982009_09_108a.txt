These crafts were made in the Blue Ridge Mountains, 
in an area along the Blue Ridge Parkway near the 
North Carolina-Virginia border. This area was the 
subject of a study undertaken in simmer and fall of 
1978, by the American Folklife Center of the Library 
of Congress in cooperation with the National Park 
Service. These folk crafts represent in part the 
rich and varied cultural heritage of the Blue Ridge 
people. (Photograph by Thomas A. Adler) 
Although Mazie Beamer from Galax, Virginia, 
remembers her grandmother's loom and weaving, 
she did not start making her own rugs until 
1966. She now weaves from 200 to 300 rugs 
a year, and sells them at a local craft shop.

Lyntha Filer prepares to photograph a church interior as part of 
the documentation of the American Folklife Center's 1978 Blue 
Ridge Parkway Folklife Project. Two devices help her achieve 
steadier pictures: the tripod and the use of a cable release. The 
cable release is the white object standing vertically above the 
camera; using it to depress the shutter button instead of a finger 
can help reduce camera jiggle. (Library of Congress photo by

Blue Ridge Parkway Folklife Project. In this situation, Mullen was

using a stereo recorder (at his left) a second microphone arranged 
to record Mrs. Ruth Barnard, seated just beyond the edge of the 
photograph on the right. Both microphone setups consisted of cardioid 
pattern microphones on stands and booms. (Library of Congress photo

Fieldworker Beverly Robinson collects information about wild plants 
from Mrs. Etta Anderson of Ocilla, Georgia, accompanied by 
granddaughter Tisha Bryant and brother-in-law Clement Anderson. 
The work was performed as part of the American Folklife Center's 1977 
field research project in south-central Georgia. Beverly's recording 
technique involves placing a clip-on microphone on Mrs. Anderson's 
lapel and having her carry the recorder as she points out various 
plants. (Library of Congress photo by Carl Fleischhauer)

during the fieldwork phase of the American Folklife Center's 1978 
Blue Ridge Parkway Folklife Project. Carl Fleischhauer is the 
recordist and stepped away from the machine to make this photograph. 
The stereo recorder is set up with a pair of cardioid pattern 
microphones in a tip-to-tip arrangement. On the recording, Hatcher's 
voice is heard equally on both channels while Mullen's questions 
and other sounds tend to be louder on one channel than the other 
and give the recording a sense of ambiance. (Library of Congress

Fieldworkers Terry Eller and Bob Fulcher videotape Wally Macnow, 
Veoma Easter, and Josh Easter preparing apples for drying on the 
Easters' front porch near Low Gap, North Carolina. This documentation 
was part of the fieldwork for the Blue Ridge Parkway Folklife Project, 
conducted by the American Folklife Center and the National Park Service 
in 1978. Camera steadiness is enhanced by the use of a shoulder brace 
and a well-supported camera position. The audio is being recorded by 
a hyper-cardioid, directional microphone instead of the video system's 
built-in microphone. Sound quality might be further improved by the 
use of a windscreen and a sound assistant to hand-hold the microphone, 
keeping it as close to the subjects as the camera's framing would 
permit. The videotape recorder is just beyond the photograph's edge 
at the right. (Library of Congress photo by Lyntha Eiler)
