MEMORANDUM
Music DIVISION
TO THE GROUP OF THE Mail DIVISIONS May 22, 1939
Attached is a notice from the Railway Express Agency and a letter from Mr. Lomax
in regard to a shipment from Mr. John A. Lomax of phonograph records belonging to
the Library of Congress. The “C.O.D. Charges” of $500.00 are obviously the result of
a misunderstanding for this sum represents the valuation. I suggest that the express
company be informed of their error so that storage charges will not be charged while the
matter is being adjudicated.
I have already written to Mr. Lomax about this his answer is attached.
Harold Spivacke Chief, Division of Music
