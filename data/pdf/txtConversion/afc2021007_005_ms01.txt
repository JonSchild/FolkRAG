Brad was born in 1951 and came to Alaska at age 17 in 1969.  He immediately began to work 
for hunting guides in remote sections of Alaska eventually becoming the youngest professional 
guide in Alaska operating his own business.  Concurrently he became a commercial halibut 
fisherman and eventually a charter guide operating out of Homer on the waters of Kachemak 
Bay.  He is a commercial set net and halibut fisherman who lives on the south side of Kachemak 
Bay.  A central theme for Brad is a concept often heard throughout rural Alaska called “Old 
Alaska”. This refers to the willingness of individuals and small family-owned business to operate 
on credit and to support people making a living fishing, hunting.  This willingness to share freely 
and to support people starting out is often viewed by the older generation of Alaska as 
something that has been lost as populations increase and rural self-sufficient lifestyles are 
slowly replaced though gentrification of rural communities.

Upon graduation from high school was given a one-way ticket to Alaska.  
Passion was hunting and fishing. He learned about Alaska through 
hunting and Sportsman magazines.  Traveled to Alaska with a backpack, 
fishing pole and rifle.  In that period of time, one could travel with rifle 
through the airport and hand to Stewardess when boarding plane and 
retrive upon exiting the plane.  Offered a job with a hunting guide the 
day he arrived, and began a career in hunting “A great lifestyle” Lived in 
remote wild country starting in Talketna mountains and moving to the 
White River Country near the Yukon Border and the Wrangell Mountains 
taking care of horses used to guide in the backcountry.  Received 
assistant guide license at 18. 
Became the youngest registered guide in the state of Alaska at age 21.  
“Old Alaska” Guide start up costs high.  Old Alaska mentality was to give 
up and coming people a chance. Store owners, put people on tab, wait 
for payment at the end of the hunting season.  Kept records on index 
cards and that was only way one could get started outfitting.  Fuel 
companies also put expenses on a card.  If one couldn’t pay off in full 
and businesses would keep on the tab until the next year.  Businesses 
were owned by an older generation.  When those people retired or were 
bought out, and new businesses didn’t operate on older credit system.  
Businesses that had been established in territorial days prior to 
statehood.  Arrived on Kachemak Bay in early 1970s to fish halibut and 
crab.  
Dabbled in charter fishing in Homer.  Friends started commercial halibut 
fishing with a skiff.  Spring and fall guiding, summers free, started 
commercial halibut fishing. Halibut skiff fishing fleet out of Homer.  Hand 
line pulling out of tub gear.  Fishing off Yukon Island and Sadie Cove, and

pound, good money in early 1970’s no ice, deliver to processor and 
receive check in same day. Primarily small boats and skiffs fishing halibut 
in Kachemak Bay.  Larger scale boats fishing crab and shrimp in the Bay 
15:00-20:00 
Commercial shrimp, pot and trawl fishery. Memorable skiff fishing 
experience.  Lost in the fog off Seldovia, heading to Homer.  Halibut 
season with Jago two-week fishing openers, 3-4 full two-week periods. 
Rapid decline to shorter and shorter periods leading to short  1-2 day 
derby fishing periods. Homer based small boat halibut fleet. 
20:00-25:00 
Looking for fishing job and first boat. Couldn’t get deckhand job, so 
bought a 28 ft wooden boat.  No experience looking at boats. Marine 
surveyor recommended, easy to get bank loan.  Needed to find fishing 
gear, started fishing with snap on gear and J hooks. Hauled with small 
hydraulic line hauler, faster to haul by hand, no coiler. First dechand was 
green. 
25:00-30:00 
Memorable sets off McDonald Spit and off Seldovia Bay. Bad weather 
fishing off Port Graham.  Sets only soaked an hour.  Jago comfortable to 
live on during fishing season.  After fishing seasons shrunk shifted to 
charter fishing out of Deep Creek. Built a wooden boat to set net for 
salmon near home in Kasitsna Bay.  Wooden skiff part of Kachemak Bay 
set net fishing traditions.  Strong Kachemak Bay skiff building tradition 
inspired building own wooden skiff. 
30:00-35:00 
Inspired by Dick Dunn, Dave Seaman and Mike Balough, and Kodiak 
Ophiem skiffs.  Built an east coast designed sea skiff, high transom and 
motor well.   Considered trolling in Southeast Alaska. Set nets sites 
available outside home on McDonald Spit.  Community based fishery.  
First season, huge learning curve.  Richmond Star, halibut boat.  Wanted a 
traditional larger wooden fishing boat.   
35:00-40:00 
Found Richmond Star for sale on Vancouver Island.  Convert a Canadian 
registered boat to fishing in Alaskan waters.  Spent a week to visit it.

Homer and Seldovia.  Same commercial fishing and hunting opportunities 
may not exist today for younger generations.  Children loved sport 
subsistence and charter fishing. Outdoor opportunities less interesting to 
a younger generation more interested mobile devices. 
45:00-52:57 
Parents let Brad experience life and challenges on his own and struggle 
and go through life. Same chance given to his kids to learn things on their 
own.  Embrace of traditional coastal Alaska lifestyle.  People ask “what do 
you do?” There is no answer. It is just a whole life.  Motto is to “live big”.  
Environmental change, crab and shrimp decline, historically larger snow 
years, Seldovia population grows and contracts. Homer use to be 
fisherman and unemployed carpenters, now carpenters and unemployed 
fishermen.  Advice to a younger version of himself, or other people 
interested in subsistence and fishing lifestyle is need to be tough, 
mentally tough. Younger generation less willing to take risks and endure 
physical discomfort.  How grew up shaped perseverance and 
adventurous.  Struggle and pushing self is part of experience.  Final 
comments, don’t live with regrets.  Have to make things and make the 
life one wants work.
