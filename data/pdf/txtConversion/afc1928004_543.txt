I 
am Mike Looney the Wrestler, 
Down me if you can; 
I 
threw Homer Lane in the gutter, 
Near killed John McMahon; 
I 
am the champion of Ireland, 
No one can give me a 
fall; 
When I 
threw Bibby and Miller, 
I 
am sure I 
can down them all. 
Cnottus: 
I 
can break McLaughlin in half, 
The girls on me are spooney; 
They all know I 
am the darling, 
I 
am the Wrestler, Mike Looney. 
Last Summer in England, 
I 
downed over thirty-eight; 
Queen Victoria kissed me, 
And said 1 
emild'ut be bate; 
I 
threw all the Frenchmen, 
Near broke their necks with the fall; 
Napoleon bet twenty-five dollars, 
That I 
could down them all, 
(Chorus).

In Sing Sing Prison where convicts dwell, 
Many funny stories they can tell; 
In Auburn, too, they cannot lurk, 
They are provided with plenty of hard work; 
If they make a 
mishap, the punishment is hard, 
Three days breaking stones out in the yard; 
And if one trys to mash the keepers' daughter, 
Iris bill of fare is bread and water. 
What are you in for? Nothing; that's what they all 
say, 
Well, I 
stole a 
suit of clothes and sold it down 
the bay; 
Say Jack it's hard, to-day I 
only eat a 
cracker, 
give you a 
kiss for a 
chew of tobacco; 
The Keeper will drop, I 
heard him yell, 
Nix, or he'll sentence us to the dark cell; 
It's too bad about Jimmy, in life he might have 
risen, 
Only think of dying in a 
lonely State's Prison. 
Who is that fellow Keeper Twelve sent to bed? 
If I. catch him in the Shoeshop I'll break his head; 
You better let him alone, Mike, the punishment is 
deep, • 
Four days without food, and four days without 
sleep; 
Look what he done when Kelly gave him the slip, 
Every day gave him a 
stroke with the whip; 
Well I 
don't give a 
cent, I'll make somebody cry, 
I'll give any Keeper sauces me a 
smash in the eye. 
FUNNY LITTLE MICK. 
Written by ROBERT JONES, and sung by SHEEHAN 
JONES, 
I 
am a 
funny little Mick, 
And my name is McGuire; 
I 
am just thirty-seven, 
I 
was born in a 
fire; 
I 
went to school to learn to be 
A 
preacher; 
Swallowed all the dictionarys, 
And got married to the teacher. 
CHORUS: 
Then I 
am funny, funny, funny, 
And pon my soul 
I 
can pull a 
train of cars, 
Or carry a 
ton of coal. 
My father was a 
woman, 
My mother was a 
man, 
My brother is my uncle, 
My sister is an Alderman; 
I 
can sleep on the roof, 
And skin clothes-lines; 
And own twenty-five shares 
In the Jonah Grasshopper Mines,

Stole my papers and Election tickets, 
And chased me from the Polls;

Last Sunday I

I

And walked home without any clothes.

Mother, tell my little brother 
That papa is a 
gin dissecter; 
Look at the strength of his breath! 
It will break the glass 
Or scare a 
chest protector; 
The angels bid me hurry up, 
It's now just 20 minutes after half past 7; 
Put some sandwiches in a 
basket, 
To do me on the road to heaven. 
Tell my sister she is a 
darling, 
She better try and catch a 
mash; 
She is growing old and getting tough, 
If she gets left, she'll have to go slinging hash; 
Put a 
bottle of ink in my coffin, 
A suit of clothes and a 
loaf of bread; 
Kick the Sexton in the jaw, 
If he won't watch the grave when I 
am dead. 
Little Patsy was a 
school boy, 
Sassy words were very handy; 
Hung on the 4th of last Jew New Years, 
For stealing seven sticks of candy. 
Our Stage-Struck Daughter. 
Written by JonN SHEEHAN, and sung by SHEEHAN and JoNEs with great 
success at Tony Pastor's. 
Pat McMonaghan, that is my name, 
And I 
have lately crossed the water ; 
My heart it is completely broke, 
For I 
have a 
stage-struck daughter. 
She says she supports Edwin Boots, or Shoes, 
Mary Anderson wkit her lays low; 
Then thousand dollars is the salary she does ask, 
Or to the theatre she won't go. 
CHORUS. 
She has her mother's heart near broke, 
Whit play-acting she is crazy; 
Her mother wanted her to be a 
servant girl, 
But for work she was too lazy. 
She calls herself the leading lady 
In the Ballet or Can-Can; 
She is a 
perfect masher, and 
She broke upon the leading man. 
As a 
slack-wire dancer she is great, 
She plays the villian's part ; 
In the character of Juliet 
She broke poor Romeo's heart. 
MAN OF EDUCATION, 
Written by BENJAMIN COLLINS, expressly for SHEEHAN 
JONES. 
Don't talk to me of your high toned men, 
And their fluent conversation; 
There's none with me, boys, can compare, 
I 
am the greatest in the nation. 
I 
am known by all, both great and small, 
An Irishman from Donegal. 
And the ladies all say, both one and all, 
I 
am a 
man of education. 
CHORUS. 
I 
am an Irishman, both heart and hand, 
I 
have just come over to this free land, 
And I 
will have you all to understand 
I'm a 
man of education. 
I 
am never taken for Charley Ross, 
I'm a 
man of solid foundation; 
I 
will tell you, boys, that I'm the boss, 
And I 
am proud of my high station. 
Of the war in Europe I 
know all about, 
A 
brass band lollov:s mt- when I 
go out, 
The boys all lift their hats and shout, 
For the man with edneation. 
I 
am an Irishman, etc 
GONE TO JOIN THE OPERA, 
OR, MARGARET JANE. 
Sung with great success by JOHN SHEEHAN, 
Shure I'm a 
man that's learned and grand, 
As any in this land; 
But then I've had a 
sad downfall, 
And the blow I 
cannot stand, 
For Margaret Jane, my oldest girl. 
Has lately run away: 
Wiil Brignolia she's gone to sing— 
She's the star of the operia. 
CHORUS. 
She can sing in the key of forty-three; 
She's a 
voice like a 
young blue jay; 
She's as fine and grand as any in the land. 
Now she's gone wid the operia. 
I 
thought to fetch her back wid me, 
Till the place where I 
was born, 
For to wed a 
Prince or an Irish Duke, 
And she laughed at me wid scorn; 
She called me " Old Scully," and " Stab his ribs, ' 
Told me go hire a 
dray, 
Pull down my chin, wipe ofi my vest. 
And come to the operia. 
She can sing, etc. 
THE MURPHY TWINS. 
W06,1011 by JOHN SHEEHAN, and sung by the famous SHEEHAN 
JONES in their original sketch entitled " The Arrival 
of the Murphys." 
We are the Murphy twins, 
From the County of Kildare, 
We just arrived this morning, 
At the Castle Garden pier; 
We are looking out for Mulberry Street, 
Where lives our brother Dan. 
Ire is an American citizen, 
Likewise an alderman. 
CHORUS. 
We are the Murphy twins, 
From the County of Kildare, 
We have just arrived this morning, 
At Castle Garden pier; 
We crossed the stormy ucean, 
To become American citizens, 
Where could you find an Irish pair 
Could beat the Murphy twins. 
The morning we left Kildare. 
Our mother she did say— 
Hold up your heads me children, 
For you are going to America; 
You may become aristocrats, 
Or Democrats, you know, 
But don't forget old Ireland, 
Wherever you may go. 
We are, etc, 
THE DAY WE LEFT THE OLD DART. 
Written by Jolly SHEEHAN, and sung by SHEEHAN k 
JONES 
their original Irish Comedy Farce, entitled " The Day 
we left the Old Dart." 
In dear old Ireland we were born, 
It's many years ago; 
And raised up in sweet Monaghan, 
It's the place where we're from, oh. 
We came over in the ship called Dreadnaught, 
From friends we had to part ; 
It caused us both to weep and wail, 
When we left the Old Dart. 
CHORUS. 
• 
We are poor old Irish green horns, 
It was hard for us to part; 
it caused 'Us both to weep and 
When we left the Old Dart. 
The morning the ship left Liverpool deck, 
Our poor mother did say, 
" 
God bless ye, me darling children. 
For you're going to America ; 
Yon are going across the ocean," 
We thought of it on the spot, 
We often sit down and curse the day, 
When we left the Old Dart.

BACK TO THE OULD DART AGAIN. 
Written by Huou J. GALLIN. 
Dedicated to SHEEHAN & JONES, the great Irish wrest-
lers. 
We are two sons of Erin, 
We just came over here, 
From far across the deep blue sea, 
From a 
place we love so dear; 
With main and might, day and night, 
Our efforts have been in vain, 
We had no rest, so we think it best 
To go back to the Ould Dart again 
CHORUS. 
Oh, why did we ever lave it (
spa.) 
Our hearts they now crave it (svin) 
We are two Irishmen, 
Both with might and main ; 
All day we tread for work and bread, 
We'll go back to the Ould Dart again. 
When we left old Ireland, 
With spirits light and tree, 
We took a 
trip in a 
great big ship, 
And landed in America; 
The politicians met us, 
And said to us quite plain— 
Tweed with a 
pang, gave away the gang, 
And is back to the Ould Dart again. 
Oh, why, etc. 
And now, kind friends, we'll say good bye, 
We'll sing to you no more, 
We're going to cross the raging sea, 
To the home we do adore; 
And if we have not pleased you, 
We hope you won't complain, 
But with just cause give us applause, 
We're going back to the Ould Dart again. 
Oh, why, eto.

HAN, in the greatest of all Irish sketches, entitled 
"THE ASH BOX INSPECTOR." 
My name is Owen Slattery, I

By mending your shoes me money I

I

devil's own wife ; I

She can sing tralaloo, and she stands on het head. 
It was only last night that me daughte Kate Ann 
Invited to supper a

When asked his name lie said it was Spoons, 
Recommended by Barnum for juggling spittoons. 
" 
Me fine laddie buck," says I, " Mat ch out of here, 
Or be the ghost of old Foley, I

He made a‘rush for the door, with a 
Jump on his skull. 
He thought I

Me wife, in a 
flutter, seized hold of a

And called me a

I 
made a 
short stop on the ball of her eye. 
There's Pat McNamara, from sweet Donegal. 
The ash box inspector, elected last fall ; 
He wears a 
gold watch and chain and a 
scented boquet, 
I 
wish that the devil may wid him fly away. 
It was only this morning he sent me a 
card 
To fresco thc alley, and whitewash the yard. 
Bad luck to the sucker, if I 
had him hefe, 
would play seven-up on the edge of his ear.

OWEN REILLY. 
Sung by JOHN SHEEHAN. 
Oh, my name is Owen Reilly, 
I've got a 
son that's got me crazy, 
He comes home every night wid his blackguard songs, 
lie said he learned them up at some free and aisy: 
lie wanted his mother for to put on the boxin:r gloves wid him 
He broke his little brother's leg wid a 
poker,

Pedro, Sancho, Seven-up and the Joker. 
He says he's taking sparring 
lessons from Professor Join, 
Donovan, 
He bate the oldest boy of cross-eyed McGarrity. 
He goes prancing around all the dances of the city, 
And he have a 
girl who do be dancing at the vulgarities. 
Oh, he pawned me Sunday pants last week, 
To go and lay a 
wager, 
And he brought me down the street that night, 
For to fight a 
big Hack nagur 
There's his cousin Mike, a 
nice young man, 
Wid the finest kind of manners, 
Night after night they roamed about. 
And they called it carrying the banners. 
But the two of them gut in a 
scrape. 
They stole a 
Dutchman's pony, 
Poor Mike is iii the workhouse now, 
And Bernard's in Aronagonia. 
Oh, he tied a 
can to our dog's tail, 
When we'd gone to church last Sunday, 
lie got stiff staving tight, and stayed out that night, 
And he was up before the judge in the morning; 
lie have the house turned inside out, 
lie's gone to tL bad intirely, 
Be heavens I 
fear that hell be hung, 
God help you, Bernard Reilly.

lie wanted custard pie foe his supper; 
And he came home wid himseli" stilt-

And threw the corn beef and caLtiage in the gutter. 
Ravn't an Equal. 
Written by CHAS. D OCKSTADER for SHEEHAN and JONES. 
Oh some facts I 
am now going to tell ye's, 
And of course I'll enlighten your minds, 
-Whin you've heard all me discourse this evening, 
Faith I 
hope you's won't turn away blind. 
I'm a. great politician and statesman likewise; 
I 
could greatest improvements invent. 
Then form strong resolutions widout desolutions, 
And make me your next President. 
CHORUS. 
I 
am courted be young girls and ladies, 
They're in love wid me style and me grace, 
Ah, me figure and form are intrancing; 
Don't you think I've an ilegant face ? 
'Well, I'm Irish, and I 
knows you's don't think it, 
For of course ye's all thought I 
was Frinch •, 
I've the greatest respect for officials, 
From a 
policeman till the judge on his binch. 
I've a 
friend in the city in business— 
He does carry a

He's a 
man of high standing and laming, 
And his equal you never see more.

That Son of Mine. 
Written for SHEEHAN and JONES by BEN. H. 
BENTON. 
I 
sing to you of my darling son, whose maiden name is Billy, 
He wears a 
great big stand-up collar that he calls a 
Picadilly. 
He travels on the Avenue in a 
style that you'd call grand, 
lie talks a 
sort of lingo, and swears by jumping jingo, in a 
way you wouldn't understand. 
CHORUS. 
He's President of the Nimble Five, 
And his gang call him their god, 
And say they'll make him Alderman, 
To represent their ward. 
Whenever his club give their ball, ' tis then my darling's 
dressed, 
With his choker collar and patent leather shine, his clothes 
are of the best ; 
And, with his girl upon his arm, he's sure to lead the march, 
With a 
bill of fare pinned to his coat, he marches as stiff as 
starch. 
He's President, &c. 
When he comes home from work at night, he goes down to 
Harry Hill's, 
And when there's to be an exhibition there, his name's in big 
letters on the bills ; 
He generally sets- to with the Mouse, says he makes a 
rattler 
with young Kelly, 
But when I 
put the mits on with him, he hits me a 
whack in 
the belly. 
He's President, & c. 
He steals his mother's underclothes, to give to an Irish fairy, 
And, to keep himself in practice, wrestles with his sister Mary ; 
He feeds his bull-dog chicken pie—when his mother kicks, 
he'll choke her, 
He puts my Sunday clothes in pawn, for money to play poker. 
He's President, &c. 
When I 
say to him, " Now, Billy, dear, do not be such a 
dandy," 
He says I'd better take an hour, and not be giving him candy. 
God knows what has come over him—he's cracked, as I'm alive, 
He's broke my poor old heart in two since he joined the 
Nimble Five. 
He's President, & c.

If I 
was an Alderman. 
Written by JOHN SHEEHAN, and sung with great success by SHEEHAN 
and JoNEs in their original sketch entitled " Duffy's Lane." 
If I 
was an alderman in this great:glorious land, 
To help the workingman I'd make people understand 
That I 
would be the first to holler about the thieving silver 
dollar, 
And all who kicked should get the collar. 
If I 
was an alder-
man, 
The East River Bridge should be done, and elevated roads 
be run 
For five cent fares, to help the workingman. 
Then I'd have a 
great 
ig say about all sinecurists' pay, 
Who work but two hours a 
day, if I 
was an alderman. 
And then I'd help the poor who are starving by the score, 
They shoullnever beg no more—I 
would have an open door. 
Two good gold dollars a 
day should be the laborer's pay, 
That's what I'd surely say if I 
was an alderman. 
I 
should make a 
liquor law that would never be a 
bore, 
And not favor one particular clique or clan; 
Put insurance thieves in jail, and have no one to go their bail, 
Up the river they should sail, if I 
was an alderman. 
I 
would look for all the cranks who burst our savings banks, 
Then drown them all in tanks and gain the people's thanks. 
I'd hang Henry Ward Beecher, the 
notorious Brooklyn 
screecher 
And famous free-love teacher, if I 
was an alderman. 
Then I'd bring ould Ireland here, who is to my heart so dear, 
And not let England make slaves of the Irishmen. 
The red, white and blue and green together should be seen; 
No one should go between if I 
was an alderman.

success by DAN INIcCARnis, the great Irish vocalist and dancer.

Oh, I 
came to this country a 
short time ago, 
To better my fortune to find, 
For the old country, sure, is a 
very bard place, 
For any poor hard-working boy. 
But it's little better here, to my sorrow I 
find, 
As I 
search for employment each day, 
And to get it I 
can't; and the reason is this, 
Just because I 
am Irish, they say. 
CHORUS. 
Just because I 
am Irish they would give me no work, 
Just because I 
am Irish they cry, 
But where ever I 
go, in good fortune or woe, 
I 
will still be a 
true Irish boy. 
Aint it bard now,I ask you,that such things should be 
In a 
country where all are free men ? 
What have Irishmen done, now I 
plainly ask you, 
That such slurs should be cast upon them ? 
in America's troubles in days long ago, 
In the battle fields, fiercest arrayed, 
They did nobly fight for their God and the right, 
" 
Just because I 
am Irish," they cry. 
(Chorus.) 
I 
will say little more; I 
don't wish to offend, 
As my aim it is ever to please, 
And this world is a 
hard one to the poor,you all know 
With but little comfort and ease, 
There's a 
haven of rest away up in the skies 
That is ever- pleasant and fair, 
And God, in His Infinite mercy, I 
know, 
Will admit all good Irishmen there, 
(Chorus.)

A Parlor Recitation by JERRY CORAN. 
He'd a 
weed on his hat, this sad stranger, 
His clot himr, tho' shabby, was black: 
His countenance seemed to grow paler, 
As he walked with his hands at his back. 
I 
wondered if he was reflecting 
On bitter, sad things past and dead; 
his mind, seemed to Inc. as rejecting 
Those things, for he oft shook his head! 
But plainer than words did the hat with the weed. 
Tell a 
story of mourning and sorrow, indeed. 
He sat in a 
chair at the table, 
His eyes fixed steadfast on the floor; 
I 
sympathized, but was scarce able 
To tell him I 
pitied him sore; 
My glance caught his eyes as he raised them, 
My pity he seemed to detect; 
"This world's a 
sad dream," he exclaimed, then, 
I 
listened with silent respect— 
For I 
felt that a 
sorrowing soul was in need 
Of a 
friend that could feel, as I 
looked at the weed 
lie gazed on the floor for a 
minute, 
Then mournfully sighing, he said, 
" 
Ali, yes; a 
sad dream; nothing in it;" 
Then I 
asked, " if his mother was dead? " 
"No?" " Perhaps some dear sister or brother?" 
He answered, 
I 
never had one; 
" 
Some near, dear relation or other? 
He replied, " There are none of them gone." 
Yet no common sorrow could make a 
heart bleed, 
Like the heart of the man with the hat with a 
weed. 
THE WEED ON THE HAT—CONTINUED. 
His mood changed. " Why question?" he thunderd, 
As he suddenly sprang to his feet; 
" 
Dost consider me prey to be plundered, 
By confidence man, and dead beat? 
Or art thou an Epitaph maker? 
As your questions would seem to imply? 
Or Tomb-stone man? Leech? Undertaker? 
Which, or either? Come answer, thou spy!" 
Then I 
stammered and stuttered, embarrused, 
Not a 
word could I 
utter, but point to the weed. 
The fierce light left his eye; " oh!" he muttered, 
" 
My violence pardon, he's dead," 
Then his thanks for my pity he uttered, 
"his memory I 
revere," he said; 
" 
This weed on my hat's a 
memento, 
Of a 
father beloved, but now gone;" 
" 
Your Father? I 
asked; " No, his Country's, 
I 
mourn for dear George Washington; 
Then I 
borrowed a 
gun to accomplish a 
deed, 
Twas to shoot—not the man—but the hat with Ow 
weed.

FRITz VON WONKLE, 
MCNAMARA O'DONNELL, 
KITTY O'DONNELL. 
SCENE— Old kitchen, two chairs and table. 
Old man seated 
at table on chair. 
Low stool, Kitty sitting down on stool. 
KITTY—Oh, father, hurry up and eat your supper, and 
don't be growling there all night. 
I 
expect company, and I 
want to wash the dishes before he comes. 
FATHER—You do now, you don't say so. 
You expect com-
pany? Ah now, look a-here, I'll have none of your carrying 
on around here, Kitty, yer divil yer. 
Whist! you young 
linnet of the—No, I 
will not swear, but—(Interrupted.) 
KITTY—You will not ! what, never swear again ? 
FATHER—No, never in all my life! 
KITTY—What, never? 
FATHER—Well, hardly— 
Fritz enters through door R., and before he finishes the sen-
tence hits him with a 
wind bladder on the head, and chases 
him all around the room until the old man is exhausted. 
Fritz leaves the room, and returns shortly after with a 
big 
cow bell, and rings violently; excites the old man. 
Both 
have a 
quarrel, and Kitty pleadingly steps between and begs 
for peace and quietness, which she obtains.) 
FRITZ—Well, Mr. McNamara O'Donnell, how do you feel 
after dot liddle exebition of Pinifive? 
You know we don't 
have dot over here in Ireland what vas blayed in de United 
Sdates mit all de deatres.

dink you know 
dot too father. 
FATHER—What's that you called me, you auld Dutch ras-
cal of de divel! 
Don't ever attempt to call me that again, or 
I'll kick the daylights out of you. 
Do you heal- that, auld 
Fritz Van Winkle? 
Ha, ha, ye're the chip off the auld block. 
'Twas no harm to call you Fritz, you well deserve the name. 
FRITZ—Well, Mr. Mc. O'Donnell, you must oxcuse me for 
using that name. I 
speake me not much good de Irish lang-
uge, and when St. Patrick's Day comes, widout regard to 
klick klu klux, I 
will marry Kitty for sure. 
Ain'd dot so, 
Kitty ? 
KITTY—Yes, Fritz, that is so. 
FATHER—Look here, Dutch, you see-see-see—Man over , 
board ! 
I 
swallowed the cud of tobacco, and it's resting on 
my left lung ! 
IIould up now, I'm all right again. You made 
a 
terrible mistake. 
You said klick klu klux, when you should 
have stepped forward like hunchback McCarthy, and cry out : 
Widout regard to clique or clan, 
I 
am Muldoon the solid man, 
Hurrah for the Queen, Cod save us all. 
KITTY—Father, you will have to pardon me for keeping it 
a 
secret, you see I am -ping to get married to Fritz, and 
we will be happy all the days of our life. 
FATHER coaxingly)—Will you ask the young gintlemaa to 
have a drink, Kitty, I am sure he needs something to 
strengthen his nerves. 
KITTY—He never drinks any strong liquor, father, so don't 
you offer him any. 
FATHER—Is 
that so, he looks pale, I 
think a 
little soothing 
syrup or some of Railway's Ready Relief would do him good ; 
don't you think so, Kitty ? 
KITTY—Never mind, father ; the wedding comes off to-
morrow, and Fritz will now sing his favorite song, " The 
Shamrock."

FRITZ (
sings as follows)— 
THE STIAMR,OCIK. 
Through Erin's Isle, 
To sport awhile, 
As Love and Valor wander'd 
With Wit, the sprite, 
Whose quiver bright, 
A thousand arrows squandeed: 
Where'er they pass, 
A 
triple grass 
Shoots up with dew drops streaming, 
As softly green 
As Emeralds, seen 
Through pur.2.st crystal gleaming. 
Oh, the Shamrock, the green, immortal Shamrock . 
Chosen leaf 
Of bard and chief, 
Old Erin's native Shamrock. 
Says Valor, " See, 
They spring for me, 
Those leafy gems of morning !" 
Says Love, " No, no, 
For me they grow, 
My fragrant path adorning !" 
But Wit perceives 
The triple leaves, 
And cries, " Oh ! do not sever, 
A type that blends, 
Three godlike friends, 
Love, Valor, Wit, forever !"

and my daughter belongs to you, so now join hands, and be 
happy for the rest of yer lives ; and see here, Kitty. what 
have you got to say about yerself ? 
K ITTY (
sings)— 
I

And my Fritzy he loves me, 
We eat cabbage in our cottage, 
And he's all this world to me. 
FRITZ (sings)— 
I 
love Kitty, I 
love Kitty, 
And my Kitty she loves me, 
She's my darling little treasure, 
And in Ireland we will stay. 
FATHER (sings)— 
They're as happy as can be, 
In the winter nights when Jack Frost he bites, 
And they'll sing and dance for ye. 
They will make yer faces smile, 
Oh, they are a 
fine odd couple, 
And with me you will agree, 
They are awful mighty clever, 
And are full of merry glee. 
FRITZ—Vell, father, I 
hope you will give us your blessing, 
and pray that we may always be able to look on the bright 
side, and when the enemy comes down on us too hard, father, 
and when you are dead and gone I 
will see thr.t you are 
buried in a 
Jews' burying ground, for that is the last blace the 
devil will ever go to look for an Irishman. 
(A great noise is heard outside ; great excitement all around ; 
soldiers, sailors, farmers and milkmaids all come in ; the 
music plays an Irish hornpipe, and all hands take par, 
in the dance, after which scene closes.)

Written by J. S. BETnEzE. 
Dedicated to BILLY COURTWRIGHT. 
Romans, fellow-galloots, and citizens of the Third Ward 
Lend me thine auricular appendage, not that I 
charge ye as 
deaf, but that you may hear me. 
Give me—oh-oh, what are 
you giving us? 
Before I 
deliver my incendiary lecture, 
allow me to assure you that I 
do not advocate the blooming 
principles of the Slamnoodle Gang. I do not thrust my 
remorseless " mug" upon you for the purpose of slandering 
the fair name of wo-man ! I 
love that name. I 
wish I 
was 
a 
fascinating dark-eyed widow. 
In some instance I 
may be 
rather over- zealous than circumspect in my remarks—but 
d-o- n-t 
you- forget- it, I'm paid to do so, in U. S. lawful crisp, 
aggregating to the tune of Four Hundred dollars. 
I 
speak, 
on this memorable occasion, for the gratification of Slamnood-
lers. 
Recollect, I'm a 
susceptible tow-headed old rooster, 
married, y-o- u 
bet, and a 
father of an extensive family, but of 
healthy voracity. 
Mutual friends—martyrs of the petticoat 
government! I was feloniously kidnapped by a 
ferocious 
committee of 13 bald-headed members of the Slamnood:e 
Bamboozled Henpecked Duplex Big Boston Gang, and 
requested to so condescend, as to allow my beaming counte-
nance to shine, with eloquence, upon you. 
I 
refused to beam, 
but now, being your prisoner, apparently so, I 
see no alter-
native but to acquiesce to your dictation, and diffuse my 
opalescent luminosity. 
Fellow snoozers, solid muldhoons of the Slamnoodle B. II 
D. B. B. Gang ! As I 
stand unblushingly sober before you in 
this ancient shanghei perforated duster, permit me to— I 
must 
venture to say, from the glacial period—before ice cream was 
discovered and patented without a 
trade-mark—Yes, time 
immemorial, the astounding questions has been propounded 
and expounded, and pounded to infinity, as to who or what is 
—woman. (Lecturer advances to foot-lights) Now, before I 
proceed further to dissect this dangerous subject, I 
solemnly 
a 
41 
request you, gentlemen, that if you see an old pot-markeo, 
one- eyed dam-sel, with brass-rimmed goggles perched on her 
arched 
proboscis, and an antediluvian " sunberrelah" in 
hand, and making her way towards me with hostile demon-
stration — obstruct her way ! she's my great great mother-in-
law's oldest sister, and presidentess of the notorious Grand 
Council, 9, Boston Rights and Liberty Old Maid's Association 
—organized for the purpose of prevention of cruelty to— 
hence, you all can appreciate the, my—the situation. 
Wo-o-man ! Who is she ? What in thunder do we know 
about her ? 
venture to bet five copies of Secretary 
Evarts' 48 hours go- as-you-please letters addressed to John 
Bull on the fishery question, that this question embarrass you! 
It does not to me. 
I 
can explain this question, but to hazard 
such a 
gigantic matter, would absorb all my life time. 
I 
can 
thrash the air in three different back and forward ummersets, 
and claw the air by 16 double-back. action, 7 
diametrical-oppo-
site- motions, semi- rectangle, hyperbold-and-trapeziummed " on 
the fly;" also, am as long-winded, all at the same time, as 
Brother TALMAGE I But I'll dodge this task, and leave it to 
" 
hurricane TAL." 
To please the Slamnoodlers I 
select one 
of my million of lectures on woman : " Petticoat Gov'ment." 
Woman, we know, is, as the vulgar bath it, of the " shemale 
tribe," 
and I muss say, 
most emphatically, that 
she is 
a 
most subtle, persuasive creature. 
Yes, my fellow-beings, a 
true woman is a 
daisy. 
Woman ! oh- oh, woman! For a 
good woman I'd chew rags or undulate in a 
big sea of 
" 
Elephant Johnny's " rot-gut, paralyzing, shoot- around- the 
corner, nitric red hot whiskey, or- r-a—but where will you find 
her among you, my fellow Slamnoodlers? ' Sdeath! Look 
t'ye! 
Catch me not I 
catch ye quick—what are you giving us? 
—taffy on a 
wire ? Well, v-e- r-y 
well ! 
Look at woman's 
ingenuity I 
Is she not the great traditional originator of hash, 
and solid shot cod- fish balls ? 
C-e-r-t-ainly ? But don't you 
forget it, she's the first in a 
gossip ; first to put a 
clothes-pin 
over your nose, when you snore ; first to trifle with your heart; 
Asia, 
42 
first to study phrenology on you, with a 
fitll hand; first in 
fashion, first to hang the latest Parisian hat on her left ear; 
first to be as unreliable as a 
French clock ; first to introduce us 
to the switch ; first to give us castor—I 
solemnly appeal to 
the battle- scarred bald-headed American rooster, that proud 
strutting, magestic bird of liberty—there I 
am again. 
I 
for-
got that I was to elucidate, with moderation, upon the 
responsibilities of our happiness. 
Well, to take another fresh 
hold of the turkey, by the nape o'the neck, I 
muss say we 
must make some exceptions, of course, we have some who are 
just as uncertain as trying to tickle—with a 
nutmeg-grater—an 
unsuspicious, but capricious, mule's hind hoof without making 
him laugh from ear to ear. 
But, let us put on the spectacles 
of inquisitiveness, and gaze back, and pierce through the cob-
webs of the period of time gone by: There's Anna Dick, 
Kate, Mari—no insinuation as to their respective ven—youth-
ful age—Dr. Mari and other britcherloonerticks or suspender-
loonertics, it won't do to allow them to hold the reins of 
government ! They must remain in their female sphere—wash, 
scrub, boil coffee, and expand soft-shelled doughnuts, and- a-
ain't I 
right ? Of course I 
am. 
You say that your wife proved 
to be a 
delusion and a 
snare ? 
If you my fellow-sufferers are 
situated as I 
am, I 
say, ' tis true, y-e- s, ' tis true ! I 
have been 
successfully married IS, w- e- 1-1 
remem-m-bered, years ago. 
I 
have twent—nineteen daughters and—let me spontaneously 
arise ; 
while the tocsin or victory sounds. 
Let me not 
explode with orthodox eloquence—well, I 
be blowed ! I 
thought I 
was giving my Fourth of July oration, well it's 
enough to upset any one to meddle with anything pertaining 
to—even a 
hair pin will create a 
first-class riot, in two 
seconds, in the house. 
Well, love is like chicken feathers, 
stuck to a 
bar of soft soap, and—stuck again! Oh I'm bound to 
wade out to- night, and I'm going through this subject just as 
zealously as a 
bobtailed " dorg " with a 
tin pan tied to his hind 
leg flying around the corner. 
Can you tell me, why in the 
name of all that's wonderful in Mrs. Gaine's strawberry blond 
wig, don't woman get bald-headed? 
No, of course not! 
Now — gentlemen, please stop throwing peanuts at me— 
another staggerer is this. 
The daisies—sweet sixteens—sixtys, 
I 
mean, have the check of a 
petrified Kentucky Giant to 
regard matrimony for the future, as limited to 36 months, that 
43 
matrimony is— to educate and " paddle waxy" juvenility, the 
hope and pride of our country ; study phrenology— to the very 
roots; nocturnal debates—classic curtain lectures, of course ; 
and-a, and ultimately, divorce looming up. 
This is an astound-
ing revelation, and knocks the spots out of aspiring would-be 
Benedicts. 
Cast your eyes to the time of mother Eve ; she 
eat most of the apples— two quarts I 
believe—but don't she 
liquidate the debt now by giving us a 
pair ? Certainly! I 
hnow 
something about that, at least my—Yet, with all this, I 
think 
we are too harsh, let us be more lenient. 
Woman must have 
some recreation in life—periodically. 
What of it, 
if she 
amuses herself, once in a 
while, by tapping you over the head 
with a 
substantial and healthy frying pan, dat's her natural 
proclivity. 
Ef she at dead of night—when cock- roaches hold 
high carnival—ventures to make an inventory of your pocket-
book; or, crow-bar in hand, waits longingly for you, v, ben you 
stagger in at two in the morning, succumb to your fate, grin 
and bear it. 
But if your wife or mother-in-law, or her sister 
and her cousins, or aunts, have the unmalleable cheek of the 
agent selling " Grants Travel Around the World on 15 cents," 
a-hum ! yes, if she has the coolness to manipulate and sing 
till midnight—when the proud chanticleer croweth—yes, over 
a 
rusty, cranky, consumptive pie-an-nah, that clatters like a 
cart load of gin bottles, empty of course—with 9,999 empty oil 
cans and tin cups, running away with a yellow cock-eyed, 
blind, hairless stubby tailed-jee-whoa ! mule, d'dont stand the 
racket! Raise the yellow-fever flag on the piano ! Small- pox 
flag on the chicken house! Put a 
ton of Limburger cheese in 
her Saratoga lightning-roded trunk ! Put— let man be lord of 
his castle. 
Put—(commotion R. of parquet.) Gentlemen, from 
the alarming appearance of that conglomerated mass of ladies, 
to the right, I 
must say that my mother-in-law has " arriv," 
(Puts white beaver on, clutches umbrella ; on the defence.) 
and all are In secret caucus. 
I 
must postpone this lecture. 
I 
must place myself in ambush to save my scalp (flourish 
umbrella) Ah-h-a-a! 
" 
Before my body 
I 
throw my warlike shield.

And

CHARLES. 
SCENE— A room with table centre. 
Vase thereon for _flowers. 
Lounge, chairs, &c. 
iVindow in fiat to open. A crash is 
heard outside. 
Enter CHARLES. 
CHARLES (climbing through window, bouquet in hand, very 
much pleased, walks to and fro.)—I 
have scaled the outer 
walls unobserved. 
Here I 
am at last, in the charming retreat 
of the most adorable creature on earth. 
A 
perfect angel! 
Such eyes 1 Such hair I The form of a 
Venus ! 
The voice 
of a siren—sweet as otto of roses I She sings, too, like a 
nightingale. 
I am desperately in love with her. 
I 
could 
brave an army of Modocs or guerrillas to defend her. 
See 
her I 
must—my life depends upon it. 
I 
have sent her numer-
ous bouquets, billets-doux, & c., but she never responds ; so I 
have come myself to gain an interview. 
She cannot refuse to 
see me when she finds out how I 
idolize her. 
She lives per-
fectly secluded here, sees no one, seldom goes into society. 
I 
have watched her for hours when she has come out in the 
Park for her morning walk. 
She often looks up at my window 
and smiles upon me—that is, I 
imagine she does. 
No doubt 
she is now taking her usual stroll, so I 
will leave this note 
(puts note on table) where she will surely find it. 
I 
shall 
return for an answer at the time 1. have now appointed, and 
if I 
am not disappointed I 
shall be the jolliest dog alive.

" 
SHE IS MY HEART'S DELIGHT ." 
AIR: " The Dew is on the Flow'r." 
She is my heart's delight, 
And the apple of my eye; 
My hope by day and night, 
Of her alone I 
sigh ! 
her face it is the sweetest, 
Her form it is the neatest; 
Of women she's completest, 
And that's the reason why— 
REFRAIN— 
She is my heart's delight, 
And the apple of my eye, & c. 
I'll see her if I 
can, 
I'll dare what no man dare; 
I'll fight with fiend or man, 
I'll climb by roof and stair! 
Her eyes so fondly beaming, 
Like stars in midnight gleaming. 
Have set my soul to dreaming, 
And chain me unaware ! 
REFRAIN--

Enter ALICE, with book and bouquet in her hands, singing.• 
"I'
VE BEEN STRAYING." 
AIR: " I've Been Roaming." 
I've been straying, I've been straying, 
In the green and pleasant Park ; 
And, my gracious ! oh, my gracious! 
I 
have had the gayest lark ! 
Yes ; I 
have seen the impudent features of that young man 
looking upon me in the usual way. 
This is a 
nice, quiet 
place, but it has one annoyance—this young fellow who is 
spending his leisure time with some of his relatives on the 
opposite farm. 
They say he is very wealthy and of good 
family, and ever since I 
have been here I 
have noticed him at 
the window staring and ogling at me. 
He waves his hand-
kerchief at me, and throws over the wall numerous billets-
ft 
P'S 
iK•11; 
46 
doux with little strings and stones tied to them. 
They con-
tain all sorts of lovely verses and love-sick avowals. I 
have 
never paid any attention to this fellow ; but if he persists in 
his infatuation I 
shall have to cure him. ( Goes to table and 
discovers the note and bouquet.) 
Bless me ! here is a 
note 
in my vase ! (Opens and reads:) 
Mr Adored One 
Angel of angels ! 
Perfection of womankind ! 
Will you 
permit an interview this afternoon at 3? 
With boundless 
love and adoration, I 
am, 
Your devoted slave, 
CHARLES. 
I 
thought as much. 
The man has lost his wits. 
I 
have a 
good mind to have him arrested. 
No ; I 
have it ! 
I 
will see 
him and cure him of his delusion. 
He must be some escaped 
lunatic. 
Yes, I 
vill play a 
good joke on him„ 
It's fun ! 
I 
will cure this love-lorn Romeo. (Sings.) 
"I WILL CURE HIM." 
Conspirators' Chorus, File du 11;•.dant Angot.” 
I 
will cure him, this fellow, in the handsomest way, 
For it's well he deserves it, I 
assuredly say ! 
I've a 
plot that will floor him when he up here shall 
stray—. 
Dark deeds 
will surely perform ! 
He's coming, he's coming, that I 
know; 
This little note kindly tells me so. 
Then I'll withdraw a 
little while, 
The merry moments to beguile, 
And the train that I've laid shall explode. 
Then I'll withdraw, &c. [ Exit. 
Enter CHARLES, through window. 
CHARLES (resting his elbows on window-sill, and looking 
around)—Well, I 
wonder if my queen has arrived ? 
Oh, how 
I 
have suffered waiting her return ! 
I 
was chased by a 
bull 
all over the farm, but I 
didn't stop to take a 
horn. I 
stumbled 
into a 
hornet's nest, upset a 
bee-hive, and had to take shelter 
47 
in a 
tree to get out of the way of a 1
,-...ckus dog ; and, to 
cap the climax, somebody took the ladder away from the 
window, and I 
had to climb up the spout to get here. 
Hark! 
I 
think I 
hear an angel sing ! 
Shc's coming. I 
must keep 
ouiet. 
!Ellie; Am= , with writing materials. 
Sits at table. 
ALICE—Now I 
think I 
will write a 
letter to my pa and ma, 
and by the time I 
have finished my visitor will be here. 
{'Writes.) 
CHARLES (popping head up suddenly). [Aside—There 
she is. 
Look at her.] ( He slips down.) 
Ain 
ALICE—I thought I heard something—some mouse, no 
doubt. 
CHARLES (
popping up head)—She looks as sweet as straw-
berries and cream. 
And that Iland! 
Oh, that I 
were a 
glove 
upon that hand. (He slips down.) 
ALICE—Surely I 
heard something ; or was it the wind? 
CHARLES (popping up head)—Ali ! I 
wonder who is the 
lucky man she is writing to ? 
I 
must attract her attention. 
I 
have been holding on by the teeth long enough. ( Throws 
in glove—then hat.) 
ALICE (
starting and rising)— Mercy ! what is that ? (Dis-
covers glove and hat.) 
A glove—a 
gentleman's glove and 
hat! (Discovers Charles, who is frantically endeavoring to 
attract her attention.) 
Oh, dear (Screems.) [Aside—It's 
11 , !] 
CHARLES (coming through window)—Yes, madam ; don't 
be alarmed. 
Don't scream. 
Let me tell you how much I 
love you—here at your feet ! 
(Duet.) 
" 
OH , MADAM , HEAR !" 
AIR: " Quaker Duet." 
CHARLE5-0h, madam, hear what I 
have got to tell; 
I 
won't detain you very long. 
ALICE-- 
It's wicked, sir ; you know it mighty well, 
Your presence here is wrong. 
48 
CHARLES—Your face and form have stolen my heart from 
me, 
And so yourself I 
had resolved to see. 
ALICE— 
You might have entered by the proper way, 
But now you're here, you hadn't better stay. 
BOTH. 
I 
love you true, yes, verily, oh, verily, 
Oh, yes, verily, oh,— 
I 
do love you—oh, verily, oh, 
Oh, toll me, tell me, darling, 1
-ou'll be mine ! 
I 
don't love you, that's verily, oh, 
Verily, oh, yes, verily, oh, 
I 
can't love you, that's verily, oh, 
I 
never, never, never can be thine. 
CHARLES— I'd climb the Andes, scale the highest peak, 
To catch a 
glimpse, my own, of you. 
ALICE— 
And if you dii, I 
think that monstrous cheek 
Must dwell, bold sir, in you. 
CHARLES—Let thii; excuse my seeming want of style 
In bouncing through that window all the while 
ALICE— 
Your manners, sir, E 
can never forgive ; 
Your form and figure framed are to deceive. 
BOTH (
as before). 
I 
love you true, & c. 
I 
don't love you, &c. 
(During chorus 
fingers are twirled in Quaker style, and 
business is coquettish, & c.) 
ALICE— Sir, your mysterious entrance and intrusion in a 
lady's apartment is very improper. 
CHARLES—Oh, pray pardon me. 
Let me beseech you to 
listen to me. 
ALICE—Proceed, sir. (They take seats.) 
(Charles has a 
fright wig on, and raises it at every other 
word that is uttered.) 
CHARLES—Let my love speak for me. 
I—

SHE— 
HE—

49 
ALICE— Sir, you have been very bold. 
You have taken a 
desperate chance in this adventure. 
You have made yourself 
liable to be murdered without a 
moment's warning. 
Yes, sir. 
To be cut to pieces, and each piece given to the dogs. ( In 
low, mysterious voice)—Know, sir, that this place is a 
secret 
piison ! 
Ycs. 
It abounds in horrible underground dun-
geons ! 
Chains ! 
Bread and water ! 
Cold straw to sleep on ! 
CHARLES (
greatly alarmed)-0h, Lord ! oh, Lord ! 
And 
you mean to tell me you are a 
victim of torture and abuse, 
surrounded by all these luxuries ? 
No ! 
It can't be ! 
ALICE (
excitedly)—It's true, sir. ( Grasps him roughly by 
shoulder, making him look around and tremble.) 
I 
am most 
terribly punished for a 
crime I'm not guilty of ! 
Yes ; they 
say I'm insane I A most dangerous woman ! 
At certain 
hours of the day I 
rave and break things ! 
I 
do ! 
CHARLES (
greatly agitated)—My dear lady, you don't mean 
to say so ? You—you are subject to—to—to—fits of insanity? 
ALIcE—Yes. And my keeper is a 
most detestable villain, 
employed by my persecutor to watch me and prevent my 
escape. 
Though, I 
am allowed to walk out in the morning, 
and then return when I 
feel the spells are coming on. 
Then 
I 
am ruthlessly thrown into a 
horrible d,mgeon till they are 
over. 
CHARLES (alarmed and shaking)— Merciful heavens ! What 
is this pun—punishment for ? 
What is your crime ? 
ALICE—Because I 
won't marry the man I 
hate. (Takes 
his hand mysteriously.) 
Come hither. (Drags him to doors 
and listens. 
Looks about her cautiously, and locks doors.) 
I 
must exclude all eavesdroppers. (Looks under table, and 
then they take seats, she looking wildly arolind her.) 
CHARLES.— Mercy on me! I 
hope sho is not going to have 
one < 
those spells ! 
I 
guess I'm in the wrong house ! 
think 
better go home. 
ALICE (
slaps him on back)—Listen I I 
have a 
secret to 
unfold o: a 
most terrible and heartrending nature ! (Suddenly 
0 
rises and makes some mysterious gestures, as if pointing out 
some horrible object.) 
See ! 
Look ! 
There! 
Behold ! 
CHARLES (jumping up in affright)—What is it ? 
Which ? 
Where ? Who?

striking a 
tragic attitude) sings:

Oh, don't you see the spectre,

It's eyes are glaring ever at me, 
It's looks my heart appal ! 
Oh, kindly let me leave you, 
I'll go to my mamma! 
I've suffered enough, and I'd like to run 
And find out my dear papa! 
BOTH. 
SHE— 
Oh, see him there ; he's marching, marching off! 
I 
hope he's gone ; at him I 
dare not scoff. 
I'll drown myself by jumping from the wharf— 
Yes, he's marched, marched, marched in a 
hurry 
away! 
Oh, my heart is sad ; I 
wish I'd never come ! 
How glad were I 
if I 
were only I. ! 
Don't drown yourself, but to your dungeon 
roam, 
If he's marched, marched, marched in a 
hurry 
away! 
ALICE— Hark ! What noise is 
that ? 
Toise outside.) 
Mercy on me ! "Tis my keeper returning ! 
He will murder 
us both ! 
Save me !

CHARLES (
works fright wig. 
Makes bolt for window. She 
follows him. 
He goes through window head first, his heels 
dangling. 
She grabs his legs, and a 
crash is heard as he dis-
appears. 
She pulls through window a 
pair of pantaloons and 
rushes forward, holding them to view.)

The tallow dips in beauty, 
Shine bright upon the scene 
Of pleasant gay commotion, 
As grand as ever seen ; 
A 
kitchen full of dancers, 
In a 
famous frisky rout, 
Who lift the very roof itself, 
With this mysterious shout. 
CHORUS— 
Rise it, Reilly ! all the jolly dancers sing out, 
Rise it, Reilly! show your power and motion, 
Looney now they fly about, lazy feet had better g'out, 
When in the chorus wild they shout : Rise it, Reilly ! 
'Tis they who never weaken, 
They'd scorn to lave the flure, 
Their feet have vowed that never 
They'd make a 
record poor; 
The " Rocky Road " is startin', 
A tune they love so well, 
'Tis now the ruction boomin' grows, 
As wildly still they yell. 
Chorus. 
A few nate words of blarney, 
To some bright buxom lass, 
A few clean swigs of poteen,

And soon the shrieks of music, 
Their notes a 
warning ring, 
When up and at once again, 
They dance and wildly sing.

'Round the deck the merry feet, 
in a 
jolly measure beat, 
Whirl and glide, as down with the tide, 
On the barge they lightly dance. 
A 
vision of rare beauty, 
Floating gently down the stream, 
Thro' plashing waters silvered 
By each brilliant moonlight beam. 
A time for joy and pleasure, 
For merry dance and song, 
A time to tell love's sweetest story, 
While we drift along: 
On the •,)icnic barge ; & c.

Things Have Changed Since Hannah Died, 
Written and sung by Billy Carter. 
Hannah was a 
lovely creature, 
Long of foot and short of neck, 
Her voice was her most prominent feature, 
.fore she handed in her checks. 
She hock'd my clothes to elope with a 
fellow, 
I 
contemplated suicide, 
But I 
changed my mind rid moved in a 
cellar, 
For things have changed since Hannah died. 
Doctor Tanner is a 
fast liver, 
But his liv(-r lasted longer than him, 
If the,Brooklyn bridge is finished ever, 
You can save two cents, and needn't swim. 
II. W. B. says he can't he 'p loving her, 
But Theodore is Elysabeth's pride, 
Beecher won't pull down the blinds in Heaven, 
Pod he'll find 
That things have changed since Hannah died. 
Sammy Tilden was elected, 
But Ilutheford he did grab the ground, 
Boss Tweed left us unexpected, 
And S — ts stiff it can't b found. 
Sonic says lIaticock will be elected, 
Others that Garfield will get inside 
The White I 
louse walls, if he expects it 
Ile' 11 ji fid 
That things have changed since Hannah died.

SUNRISE. 
Quartette sung with great success all over the United States 
by the great " Novelty Four," in their original Burletta 
Rehearsal in the Parlor. 
The morning sun 
Collies peeping over the hills, 
Conies peeping over 1 
he hills, 
Comes peeping over the hills. 
SOLO. 
Oh, welcome, bright sun 
From the shadows of night ! 
All hail to the sun 
We now crown the king of light, 
Oh, merry warbling birds, 
Happy joyous birds, 
Sing their sweetest songs 
To usher in the day. 
All the earth seems -glad ; 
Every heart shall bring 
Forth its need of praise 
To Him who made the king, 
The morning sun 
Collies peeping over the hills, 
Comes peeping over the hills, 
Conies peeping over the hills. 
The hills, the hills, the hills, the—hills, 
The Primrose Family. 
Words by JOE PETTIN'GILL. 
Music by CHAS. DOCKSTATER. 
As Sung by the AMXRICAN Foun. 
We got a 
day off to sec. our girls, theylive in yonder cot, 
The number on the door is one hundred and forty-four 
And the place we've not forgot, 
'Tis Master Johnson's birthday, and the nigs have got 
a 
spree, 
With a 
band of music playing, we'll dance out on the 
green. 
Come out here Cloey Primrose, come out you little 
queen. 
Come out here Obey Primrose and dance here on the 
green. 
CHOM3s. 
We'll drive the gospel engine, 
We'll drive dull care away, 
We'll sing and dance with hearts so light, 
While the band does sweetly play. 
When we go out to promenade we make the white folks 
smile, 
Arm in arm we go along, you bet we put on style, 
Down on the green where we'll be seen, we'll make the 
leather shake, 
Hand in hand we lead them all a 
walking for the cake. 
Put on style Obey Primrose, I'll do just as I 
please, 
Put on style Obey Primrose and we'll dance here on 
the green. 
(Chorus.)

Then they Chase the Landlord from the Nor. 
Written by Edwin Talbot for Pat Rooney and sung by him 
with great success. 
AIR—'' Never take the horseshoe from the Door," as sung 
by Harrigan & hart. 
Every month the rent is handed to the landlord, 
In the tenement house, where the families congregate, 
Then Mrs. Duffy says that Mrs. Reilly's (laughter, 
In the sink threw dirty cabbage and corn mate. 
CHORUS. 
Olt, then they get a 
drinking and a 
slugging, 
It's worse than listening to the Pinafore, 
13ut when Kelly throws ashes at Terry Monaghans mother, 
Arndt, it's then then they chase the landlord from the 
door. 
Mrs. McNally had sixteen shirts upon a 
clothes line, 
A 
rid a 
hrand new suit of dresses from the store, 
Youmr Kelly's son he stole them and he pawned them, 
You can bet she chased the young kid fro.n the door. 
Last night her daughter Mary Ann the speeler, 
Was standing with a 
young man she met before, 
Some one dropped out a 
scuttle full of cinders, 
To chase the dizzy lovers fruit the door, 
The milk is left up in the hallway every morning, 
From Jacob McCarthy's german grocery store, 
When he tries to collect his hill they give him warning, 
And chase the pmr old milkman from the door. 
TERRY DUGAN'S NIECE. 
Parody on

Volume 6th, Mulligan Guard's Pie-Nie. 
By RICHARD J. 
PIGOTT. 
Copyright 1850. by Mrs. PAULINE LIEDF.R. 
Come gather round ye laddy bucks, 
An' let yees hould yer whist; 
While I 
describe a 
pretty lass, 
As sweet as e'er was kissed. 
The mashers whin she walks abroad, 
Around her flock like geese; 
With lots of cash, to try and mash, 
OuId Terry Dugan's Niece. 
CHORUS: 
She weighs a 
hundred and a 
spike, 
And hits a 
powerful blow; 
She'll lick her weight in pralee-bn:rs, 
At least they tell me so. 
She's traveled ' round and 'round the globe--
Is known from here to (-4eece; 
"rwould turn your pate, to see the gait, 
Of Terry Dugan's Niece. 
She's such a 
lovely dancer, too. 
She'd break a 
fellow's heart; 
The way she Knickerbocker's ' round, 
In such a 
manner ' tort;" 
Her Montague's beneath her hat, 
Are plastered on with grease; 
I'll bet me hat, there's nothing that, 
Compares with Dugan's Niece. 
Sure Terry keeps a 
bucket-shop, 
And owns a 
block or two; 
Of tenements in Cherry Street, 
Excelled in style by few. 
Sure when he dies, his Niece and 
Will married be, and peace 
And comfort we'll enjoy forever, 
Mesilf and Dugan's _Niece.

The Poor Serio-Comic. 
Words by John McVeigh. 
To my friend Wm. Carter, and sung by him with great 
success. 
Oh ! the titles of songs of late are so used 
That it's hard a 
new one to find, 
But I've hit one at last and I 
think 't 
will please, 
So carefully bear it in mind. 
" 
Remember the poor," " You've children of your own," 
I'll admit to be very good logic, 
But the title I've given to the one I'll now sing, 
Is " Pity the poor serio-comic." 
CHORUS. 
See how she struggles with music and words, 
She acts like a 
colt on a 
frolic, 
She yells and she screeches then gets out of key. 
So pity the poor serio-comic. 
About six months ago, a 
mechanic she was, 
In a 
hotel at the corner of the street, 
Till she formed the acquaintance of a 
bad actor so gay, 
Who told her she was charming and neat,

THE POOR SERIO-COMIC.—Continued. 
He put her on the stage with about a 
dozon more. 
And they say now that she takes a 
tonic, 
But she isn't to blame—sure she's working for fame, 
So pity the poor serio-comic. 
CHORUS. 
Then help her along to the jail if you can, 
And her discords put to an end, 
Treat her with kindness, then slug her with blicks. 
And prove your the dizzy's best friend. 
No\.. 
hese poor serio-comics oft have nothing to wear. 
Except ores that cost a 
hundred or two, 
And I'm sure that's enotic, 1: 
and I'll know you'll admit, 
To make any poor creature feel blue. 
Oh, they get by the week ten dollars or so, 
Which makes them feel badly and•chronic, 
Vet they wear diamond rings that would swell a 
inan . 
head, 
Those poor dizzy serio-comics. 
CHORUS. 
Then always extend to them your hand or your foot, 
In kindness to them never lack, 
For the poor serio-comic don't know what she does, 
Let her alone and she'll surely come back.

result of this dilemma, many lives are spent as an unloved 
tedious existence, which might have been prolonged and enjoyed in the 
happiness of matrimony. 
This pack of Cards will overcome the diffi-
culty, and being in the shape of questions and answers, will cover every 
phase of courtship. 
The sentiments conveyed therein need not be 
adopted by the parties to the game as their own, unless it accords with 
the state of their affections, which fact makes a 
further explanation un. 
necessary. The playing of these Cards is not restricted to two players, 
but may be enjoyed by evening parties

" 
An ingenious little book of the thaumaturgic order 
has been sent us, called HumpTy DUMPTY,' and bound 
in such a 
way as to give opportunity for a 
decidedly 
puzzling. trick. 
While presenting the ordinary appear-
ance of a

it is so bound that a 
practiced manipulator, taking it 
up, and flirting the leaves rapidly over, can make it ap-
pear to be filled with copies of only one picture, or with 
blank pages, or with any one of quite a 
succession of 
figures.

appears to contain nothing but portraits of Harlequin, 
in his tesselated suit ; the next, only Columbine ; then, 
nothing but Pantaloon, or Riding Hood, or -
