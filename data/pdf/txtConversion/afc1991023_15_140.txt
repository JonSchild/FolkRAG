I held the mike that we used with the Sony tape recorder 
while Cliff talked and worked on cognitive mapping. 
We were 
sitting at the kitchen table at right angles to each other.

I went down to Forked River to see Cliff and Lucille 
Frazee in order to try to do some cognitive mapping with them. 
For a description of the negotiation involved in getting the 
mapping started see PFP83—FMO1112. 
This tape 
is a running 
commentary that is meant to accompany the maps Cliff worked on 
during this session. 
(001) I began talking to Cliff about drawing the first map Nora 
asked me to work on, 
i.e., a map of the Pinelands as Cliff saw 
it, 
drawn to whatever scale he chose, on a blank piece of paper. 
Cliff began by saying we would have to have some boundaries. 
He said when you come down Rte 72, a lot of the water around 
there drains into the Wading River, down as far as 532. 
Then 
from there on 
it drains the opposite way. 
Chatsworth drains into 
the Mullica River (the water around there, that is). 
The Wading 
River goes into the Mullica too. 
So do you want to do some drawing, I asked. 
I said I know 
it 
is 
an odd question, as I saw Cliff nod his head and say, 
"Naoh," while Lucille, his wife, piped in with, "He's no good at 
drawing." 
(This was not going to be easy.) 
Cliff said he

couldn't see any sense 
in drawing a map without a map already in 
front of him, so he could put whatever I wanted onto it. 
I said 
we could do that, that I had these other maps here. 
Cliff said 
that that would be better, and that then I would have something 
uniform. 
That you (one has) got maps that's uniform, but the 
thing 
is that you want more onto 
it, right? 
That's the idea of 
it, 
he said. 
At this point Lucille said that she thought the idea of 
it 
was that I wanted his idea of 
it. 
Cliff interrupted her at the 
first "it." 
And he said, "If I made a map it's going to be out 
of proportion, cause I'm no map maker or anything." 
Lucille then 
said, "They understand that." 
And I said, "Yea, that's right," 
to Cliff, thinking that it was easy for Lucille to say things 
like that from her position of safety. 
(Meanwhile Boris 
Weintraub, who had accompanied me, sat there wondering why he had 
come since he only had one day to cover the Pinelands story. 
He 
verified this later, but later the whole interview turned around 
and became fascinating. 
Not that this section wasn't 
fascinating, with Cliff and especially my nervousness about the 
whole project. 
A good practice session, Nora.) 
Cliff continued by saying that I had maps in proportion with 
nothing on them, didn't I. 
I agreed, thinking of the 
large 
Pinelands map. 
I spread it out on the table. 
(At this time I 
noticed that the vu meter on the Sony tape recorder was not 
registering, and I knew I would have to test it because Boris did 
not know how to figure that out.) 
I said that this map was 
technically the Pinelands. 
Lucille asked if 
it was from Jackson 
on down because she thought of that as the northern border of the 
Pinelands. 
Jackson Township was at the "top." 
Cliff asked what the 
dotted lines indicated. 
I said they were the township lines 
brought out the felt tip pens. 
At this point I said I had s 
smaller maps too, and I have one that covers just the area a 
here (Forked River).

I continued by saying that the map 
in front of him was the 
larger one. 
Cliff said that you could see on this map that all

.t 
of Chatsworth area goes into the Mullica River, even all the way 
up to Rte 70, 
no up there it's the Bass River. 
He was looking 
for the Crammer place to show me. 
He found what he thought would 
be Rte. 539 (they aren't labelled on this map). 
It must be the 
Oswego River that goes up there and that goes into the Wading 
River 
At what they call Howardville are some cranberry bogs. 
The 
state bought that. 
It was Penn Producing Co. 
Cliff asked me 
what I wanted to put in there. 
I said the name of 
it 
(Howardville) and what it 
is, 
and maybe that it 
is state owned. 
Cliff said Howardville was actually a mile 
in from the bogs. 
I noticed that Cliff printed and very slowly. 
I think he 
was uncomfortable doing it. He made each letter carefully, and 
each was composed of 
lines perpendicular to each other. 
This is 
a problem with asking someone to do this kind of thing. 
I did 
ask him a couple of times 
if 
he would like me to write some 
things in, 
and did write a couple of things. 
But it kind of put 
him on the spot to answer a question like that, I think. 
So he 
ignored it/brushed it off. 
I told Lucille at this point (she was hovering around) that 
she could enter things too. 
She said something unclear about 
letting Cliff do 
it because he was the expert in these matters. 
I asked Cliff to include the cranberry bogs. 
He said they 
were there but were all 
growed up now. 
Another problem, time, 
that we encountered again and again. 
I asked him to 
inc►ude them 
anyway as cranberry bogs when he was young. 
He said that they 
scooped 9000 bushels off of that one year. 
The state bought it 
and.... 
They scooped there about 25 years ago. 
It's a hunting 
preserve now, he said. 
That's a change that the state made. 
They didn't do anything with it. 
There were about six houses 
there, for the help and people that worked on the bogs. 
The 
state tore everything down. 
It doesn't exist anymore. 
"But you 
just want to know the history or 
it, right?" 
I said yes. 
(075) Cliff asked Lucille if she wanted to write this because he 
was no good at writing, and he would need a thinner tipped pen 
anyway. 
I said I had a better pen. 
Lucille told him that he 
could do 
it, 
and Cliff seemed satisfied with the pen I gave him. 
(Meta—commentary needed here.) 
Cliff continued by saying actually there were about 15 
cranberry bogs there 
in a series. 
And the water used in the bogs 
ran into the Oswego River 
They had to be 
in a series because 
there was a drop, and they had to dam every one. 
Each bog would 
dam up 1000 feet or 600 feet. 
Cliff said he was not a very good 
drawer. 
I said that was fine. 
The Penn Producing Co. also owned 
a lot of bogs over in the Sinn place. 
Cliff said, "Oh, 
it doesn't show any towns here does it?" as 
O'Connor--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 4 
he 
looked for the Sinn place. 
He found 539 and followed it to 
where he thought Cedar Bridge was or is, 
and then to Warren 
Grove. The map didn't show any roads, Cliff said, and that 
screwed him up. 
That is to say it only showed the major roads. 
(That is not the way Cliff traveled then I don't think, and many 
of the major roads were not major or there then.) 
He 
looked for 532 and did not see 
it on the map. 
He plotted 
where Warren Grove is 
in Stafford Township, just outside the 
county line. 
I asked him to put it 
in. 
They have friends in 
Warren Grove. 
There 
is a road from Warren Grove out to the Sinn 
place. 
That's how he found the Sinn place. 
Lucille asked 
if 
it 
was Simm. 
Cliff did not know. 
He thought the state bought that 
land too. 
That area would be the head waters of the Wading 
River. 
Some of the bogs over there were 60 acres. 
He used to 
scoop there too. 
Penn Producing also owned some bogs 
in Brookville, where the 
Boy Scout camp 
is now. 
It's on 532 at the head of Oyster Creek 
which would probably be right in here. 
If we had the 532 in 
there it would be easier, Cliff said. 
It's almost on 532. 
532 
goes to Waretown. 
It doesn't even show that does it? 
Cliff 
found Waretown. 
He said 
it was in Ocean Township and that "this" 
was the border of Ocean right? 
So Waretown would be here. 
And 
he asked if I wanted him to put it 
in, 
and I said yes. 
(150) 
I said he could draw in 532 if 
he wanted. 
He said ok. He 
showed me where 
it crossed Oyster Creek, by 
looking at the way 
the stream ran. 
Cliff tried to draw in every bend 
in the road 
almost. 
He was being very precise. 
He then drew the road off of 
532 that goes into Brookville. 
Boris reminded us to 
label 532. 
I asked him to put down the bogs. 
He said they are not there 
now. 
And I said, "Where they were." 
He did, after asking me, 
"What do you want, just bogs?" (Not angry, he just wants to know 
what I want to know.) 
Those weren't very big. 
They were there 
thirty years ago. 
He scooped it after the war, at the latest 
1960. 
He stopped scooping when they lowered the price. 
They 
were getting a dollar a bushel, and then they lowered it. 
He 
guessed the Puerto Ricans came 
in and worked for less money. 
He 
said that's the trouble with bringing in help like that. 
(220) 
I asked where on this map he has been cedar cutting. 
He 
pointed it out, on North Branch. 
He asked me what I wanted to 
put there. 
I said "cedar cutting 1982-83 " perhaps. 
Cliff said 
that's what he got the permit for. 
Well, that's about the end of 
the cedar, he said. 
From here on down it's cedar. 
I said that 
he could just draw a circle around the area. 
He said 
it isn't a 
very big place, only about 600 feet wide. 
(By now I was leaning 
toward bringing out the more detailed maps. 
He had such a 
precise cartographical mapping approach, being used to maps of 
the area and of his property, of all kinds. 
I thought he could 
probably improve on the more detailed maps probably. 
And he 
definitely associated mapping with detailed maps 
in a literal, 
O'Connor--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 5 
government map, way.) 
He drew in the cedar area, and said from there on up 
it was 
maple and gum. 
He pointed out Cape Cabin Branch and Long Branch. 
All 
this stuff heads up. 
I asked if he could draw a line where 
the water starts flowing in the opposite direction (away from the 
ocean). 
He said the best line would be.... 
That 539 would be 
close, but it would even be east of that. 
So Jones Road would be 
your line, roughly. 
Jones Rd. 
would be from Brookville across 
this way. 
He said we did not have much to go by on this map. 
Actually he said it goes to.... He couldn't find a landmark. 
I 
said I had some real particular maps at this point. 
Meanwhile 
Cliff found another Branch (muddled). 
I brought out the 
quadrangle maps. 
He said they would probably be better, that 
they had more on them. 
There wasn't anything on the other map. 
I said that since we were going into particular detail, these 
quad maps would be a good idea probably. 
(285) 
Boris helped me spread the two quadrangle maps out. 
(Mal 
does not provide the names--SS) We found Brookville on the map 
right away. 
Cliff said Jones Rd. would probably be on there. 
He 
saw Cape Cabin Branch right away, and said some of the branches 
were named on this map. e.g., Long Branch. 
Then he found where 
they were cutting, 
including the old crossway (corduroy road) 
from the last time it was cut over. 
Cliff had shown it to Mary, 
Joseph, and me the first time we were out in the woods. 
I said 
let's circle that area. 
He asked,"What do you want to put here, 
cedar?" 
I said, yes, and the date. 
I said I was sorry to repeat 
stuff, but this seemed to be a better map than the others. 
Cliff pointed out The Sportsman's Club, and where the gum 
and maple is. 
That is where we parked the car on that first trip 
into the swamp. 
Cliff found Bryant Rd., which wasn't labelled, 
and labelled it. 
I asked him if 
he could put where Stouts Rd. 
used to be. 
He had said that was a very old road, one day when 
we were at his tree farm. 
He said he might be able to find 
it 
because of the elevation (highest ridge around). 
(335) 
We were working on two maps that overlapped, so Cliff had 
to 
line the two maps up correctly. 
I helped out with this, and 
often traced a road over into the Forked River area from the map 
to the west of 
it, which was closer to where Cliff was sometimes 
standing, sometimes sitting. 
He found 532 and discovered that he had the Bryant Rd. 
wrong. 
He found a switch road, and then found the correct Bryant 
Rd. 
He pointed out what they call Star Tree. 
He said he had to 
get the Jones Rd. 
It crosses the Bryant Rd. 
He found a lookout 
tower and then located Star Tree from there. 
Boris asked what 
that was. 
Cliff said it was a junction. 
He asked why 
it 
is 
called Star Tree. 
Cliff said 
it 
is where the Bryant Rd. and the 
Jones Rd. and a road that goes into Howardville off the Jones Rd. 
come together. 
I said let's mark the way he used to go to 
O'Connor--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 6 
Howardville. 
Cliff said the name of the road going there was.... 
He couldn't think of 
it. 
He was trying to think of 
the guy's 
name who was a game warden. 
Lucille offered a possibility. 
It 
wasn't it. 
He couldn't think of 
it then. 
So Cliff went back to Jones Rd. 
He said, "You have maps for 
this on them, don't you?" 
I said I didn't think so. 
He wrote in 
Jones Rd. 
This map shows a lot of old roads that doesn't amount 
to much. 
He then labelled the Bryant Rd. 
Cliff said, "Now we're 
straightened out a little bit." 
Then he saw the Long Ridge Rd. 
You've got the Long Branch and the long ridge. 
I thing he filled 
this 
in, 
but the tape ends here. 
Side 2 
(001) 
Cliff asked me what I wanted to put in next. 
I asked him 
to 
label his tree farm and other places where he has cut in the 
past. 
He said the boundaries of the areas he has cut are tricky, 
and he would need a rule to draw in the shapes of the pieces of 
Iand. 
He pointed out where the switch was 
in 
the road. 
Then he 
spent a while drawing the boundaries of the pieces. 
The first is 
450 acres and 
is 
labelled on the map. 
There were three pieces 
in 
all. 
He said a couple of times that it was hard to draw these 
pieces accurately, and 
if you look at the shapes of the pieces 
you can see what he meant. 
All we would have to do, he said, 
is 
look on a tax map to see them drawn accurately. 
Much time during which Cliff drew and no one talked during 
this process of drawing these pieces of 
land. 
The third one 
followed Long Branch, he said. 
He was very careful to draw in 
all 
the angles the property "made." 
Cliff said again that the 
best thing to do would be to 
look at a tax map. 
It's all 
laid 
out. 
He's just guessing now because he knows a few landmarks. 
(110) Cliff said he might as well put in the other line, the 
Stuyvestant line. 
He said if he could find Franky's Crossway 
where 
it crosses the stream. 
He found it. 
Then he labelled the 
Stuyvestant line. 
This forms the border of his property, but I 
don't know on which side. 
I don't have the maps here with me as 
I write this log. 
Many people own the 
land around Cliff's 
property. 
He 
in fact owns 32 acres of 
it. 
That I didn't follow. 
I think he 
labelled it. 
Boris asked if these are all 
dirt roads that Cliff 
is 
labelling. 
He said yes. 
(145) 
Frankie's Crossway Rd. 
is pretty well 
grooved up. 
It goes 
up to the mountains and east of them. 
Cliff labelled the road as 
well 
as the Crossway itself. 
Cliff said he needed someone who 
could draw. 
Boris said he was doing just fine. 
Cliff said he 
always has someone do his work (drawing). 
O'Connor--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 7 
(160) 
I asked Cliff if 
he had other important places, landmarks, 
or places that were important to him in the past. 
At first he 
said no, but I think he was thinking about the other roads 
because he then pointed out Jim Burke's Road (not already 
labelled on the map). 
That's the name he has for it he said as 
he wrote it in. 
Cliff said, "Trying to get the names of these roads is the 
main thing, right? 
Is that what you want?" 
I said, "That and 
any kind of places you know that have names or, and places that 
you think are important in your life, you know, places where you 
may visit people, or you may um, owned land there, or cut 
there.... 
Cliff jumped in to say that there was another old road 
here that he and his son cut off. 
He said the map didn't show 
any roads to 
it. 
I said he could put them in. 
Lucille said how 
about the charcoal pits. 
Cliff said that area is all 
cut off; 
it's all 
charcoal pits, every bit of 
it. 
(This 
is the same thing 
Stephen Lee from Speedwell said in PFP83—RM0014-018) 
Cliff 
thought the main thing would be "your switch and things like 
that." 
He pointed out the Switch Road. 
He pointed out a road 
that was all grown up and that he now plowed for a fire break. 
1 asked him if he could find the road at the very top of the 
ridge that he showed me one day. 
The map doesn't show it, 
but he 
used the elevations on the map to 
locate it. 
He said he could 
show it to me sometime and you can see all 
over from it, the 
highest point in this area. 
We were on the Switch Road when we 
saw this other road. 
Cliff said he had a map that had that road 
on 
it. 
He said he had old maps that would beat the quad maps all 
to hell. 
While Cliff went to get the map, Lucille said that she 
thought Cliff didn't understand what we were trying to do. 
She 
began to tell 
us what how she interpreted what we were trying to 
do, but Cliff returned before she got into 
it. 
He had a map that showed all 
the old roads and none of the 
new ones, he said. 
It's a different map. 
It shows roads from 
1850 and 1872. 
That eliminates all your new stuff, Cliff said. 
But he said some of the roads on the maps we brought are old, for 
instance the Switch Road was built around 1865. 
Meanwhile 
Lucille went to 
look for the map. 
Lucille brought in an aerial photo from 1955. 
It showed the 
North Branch area including the railroad. 
You can see almost 
every tree 
in the cedar swamp. 
Cliff said you can see Wright's 
Rd. 
on it. 
That's all 
grown over now. 
Cliff then pointed out the Long Ridge Road on our maps. 
It 
goes all 
the way to the Brookville Church. 
The Bryant road 
is 
old too. 
And The Jim Burke Rd. 
is old too, as old as any of 
them. 
Boris asked who Jim Burke was. 
He came around here around 
O'Connor--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 8 
1925, Cliff said, from Terra Haute, Indiana. 
He was a taxi 
driver in N.Y., and then came down here to work on a golf course 
in the Pinelands. 
He was sort of an outlaw. 
Cliff used to 
travel with him all 
the time, deer hunting, stealing wood. 
That's what he was an outlaw. 
He guessed out in the West he 
might have been a cattle rustler or something. 
He was with a bad 
actor, Cliff said. 
In the Depression, you know, they used to 
tear up these crossways, where they cut off a cedar swamp. 
They 
used to saw them up for firewood. 
Things like that. 
There 
really wasn't nothin' 
doin during the Depression. 
And all kinds 
of things. 
Cliff said he was just a kid. 
He didn't have a very 
good teacher. 
(285) 
I asked if everybody calls it the Jim Burke Rd. 
Cliff 
said he thought so, because he made a field in the North Branch 
area that was about an acre. 
They call 
it the Jim Burke field. 
It hasn't grown over, Cliff said. 
I said that was just the kind 
of stuff I was interested in. 
The two gun clubs 
in the area are landmarks, Cliff said. 
He 
showed me where he burnt 50 acres last Monday (controlled 
burning). 
Cliff said he thought we'd want to mark the Wright's 
Rd. 
And he did. 
Wright's Rd. used to hook into another road, 
and Cliff indicated that by a dotted line on the quadrangle map. 
It crossed right over Factory Branch and wound around. 
Cliff then found the Azzer Dayton Rd. 
The Jones Rd. goes 
through it. 
A branch from Factory Branch goes up to the Azzer 
Dayton Rd. 
It was named after two people. 
There was a house 
there, and a deer farm. 
Cliff thought there was only one house. 
I asked Cliff whose house we went to and parked briefly, 
that had all 
the signs on the road about no deer hunting because 
it was a deer farm. 
Cliff said that was Joe Albert. 
That is on 
the Bryant Rd. 
He put it on the map. 
He's right at the end of 
that road. 
There's nothing there now, where the deer farm used to be 
in 
Azzer Dayton. 
It was for the Stuyvestant Tract. 
There was a guy 
named Henry Branson who was the caretaker of 
it. 
It was a 
hundred years ago that it was a deer farm, at least. 
That was 
way beyond his time, Cliff said. 
So he only knows what they tell 
him, he said. 
Then he said you've got the gun club here. 
They call that 
Tilly Collins Place. 
It has different names, one I could not 
interpret, but Collins would be your best name, though. 
It could 
be either by the name Tilly Collins or her husband. 
There were a 
lot of them. 
The Collinses are woods people. 
They all 
had a 
common name, Zeb. 
They were around during and before the Civil 
War. 
One of them

METH: I just used the mike in the recorder itself and sat the 
recorder next to Cliff with the mike pointed in his direction. 
There were too many maps around, and it was the first time I had 
used them, to bother playing with a tape recorder. 
Also I had 
been unable to find a mike stand before I left.

TX01: G—Forked River; 49GT This is a continuation of PFP83—AM0002. 
(001) Cliff began to talk again about tearing up the old 
causeways with Jim Burke, and selling them for firewood. 
That 
was thirty years ago. 
We were looking at an aerial photo of the 
North Branch swamp at this point. 
The swamp is fifty years old, 
i.e., you can see where it was cut off. 
Another piece was not 
cut off, and you can see the difference. 
You can also tell where 
a fire went through. There is much more growth in the area not 
cut off. 
There is a lot of new growth of cedar in the area cut 
off 50 years ago. 
Cliff pointed out where we entered his swamp 
the day I went with him and his son, Steve, to cut cedar. 
The map shows every single tree. 
And 
it shows Jim Burke's 
rye field. And 
it shows the Sportsman's Club. 
This is a map 
photo taken thirty years ago. 
The biggest cedar in the area cut 
off 
is now 8 inches 
in diameter, Cliff said. 
A lot of 
it 
is 5-6 
inches. 
The interesting thing is that the North Branch 
is the 
cedar swamp. 
You can just barely see the stream itself 
in the 
middle of the 600 ft. wide flood plain. 
And that is the way 
it 
should be, Cliff said, his theory being that the water has to 
flow through the flood plain. You don't need the water in the 
stream; you need it 
in the swamp to feed each tree 50 gallons per 
O'Connor--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 10 
day. 
The trees wan+, the water not the Atlantic Ocean. 
(040) 
Next Cliff and Lucille brought out an 1872 map of Ocean 
County (I have a copy of this on file). 
Cliff said he has 
another map older than this. 
There was nothing there in 1872 
except a barrier reel (offshore that is). 
The reef is Long Beach 
Island. 
There might have been 25 people on all 
of Long Beach 
Island. 
Lucille brought out a black and white copy of the same 
map that was clearer than the original. 
This map shows you the Tuckerton railroad and the Central 
railroad, Cliff said. 
They have the roads numbered. 
Cliff 
pointed out the Switch Road. Then he found Wright's Road. It 
is 
labelled on that map. 
The map also showed the Old Bryant Road 
that is 
all grooved up now. 
Cliff showed where the new Bryant 
Road 
is. 
There is a cemetery named Good Luck. 
The map also gives you the names of the old families who 
lived 
in town. 
You've got the Holmes, Webb, Falkenburg, 
Williams, Brown, Parker, Warden, Chamberlain, etc. 
He pointed 
out the Lacey Road (going to rte. 70). 
The Frazees are 
foreigners, Cliff said 
in response to Lucille asking 
if they were 
on the map. 
They didn't come on the scene in Forked River until 
1880. They came from Newark, N.J. 
outsider 
The map also shows the Mill Pond, a sawmill. 
There is a 
section of the map that represents the Middle Lake, a cranberry 
bog. 
They made a lake out of what was a cranberry bog on this 
map, Cliff said. 
Also on the map 
is the Upper Lake, 
what they 
call 
the Deerhead Lake now. 
They used that for 
water power for 
a mill, a sawmill, Day and Morrow, called Saw Circle Mill. 
That 
was here in the Revolutionary War. 
Cliff's grandmother lived 
right in that area. 
She was a native, a Penn. 
(100) 
Next Cliff showed us where the Oyster Creek Plant is now, 
between here and Tuckerton railroad. 
There will be another one 
too I think he said. 
They built a lagoon a hundred feet wide 
right around the plant. 
The intake comes in the river and comes 
out into the bay. 
That is what is making the bay all screwed up, 
Cliff said. 
He pointed out Sedge Island. 
There 
is a gunning camp on 
that now. 
The island used to be twice the size that it 
is now. 
It's a duck hunting club. 
Then he pointed out Long Beach State Park. 
That's about 9 
miles long. 
And Seaside Park 
is above that. 
The state bought 
Long Beach, and 
it 
is 
in 
its natural state. 
They've got bathing 
beaches and whatever. 
They kept it pretty much the way 
it should 
be. 
(120) 
The map gives you some more outposts, Cliff said. 
There 
is Titchner, and Parker, and Matthews. 
They were living way back 
O'Connor--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 11 
in 
the woods at that time. 
Wright's Road 
goes into Cedar Creek. 
Lucille said Bamber would be right on the corner of that wouldn't 
it? 
(Lucille spent summers in Bamber when she was growing up.) 
Cliff said Bamber would be up further. 
Lucille said her sister lives 
in Bamber now. 
Cliff said 
that used to be called Fargo. 
It was a forge. 
And Cedarcrest 
too, Lucille said. 
Cliff said that there was a forge there. 
They made water pipe there. 
Lucille said that she used to have 
to walk eight miles to Tom's River to get a quart of milk, and by 
the time you got home it was sour. 
There used to be a peach orchard there, Lucille said. 
It was 
called Fargo Forge during the Revolutionary War. 
Then they 
called it Cedar Crest. 
I found a branch of the river named Chamberlain Branch. 
I 
asked Lucille where her house would have been on the map. 
It was 
west of Lacey Road, she said. 
Cliff then found a place just above Lacey Road they used to 
call 
the Meadow Place. 
That was the colored name. 
Colored 
people lived there. 
But before that it was Spalding, and they 
had a vineyard there. 
Then they got pear orchards. 
(170) 
Discussion of aerial photo maps. 
They show you 
everything. 
You can go up to the county and get them, Cliff 
said. 
They cost about $5. apiece. 
You need to know which ones 
you want. 
They are 
in 
10 square mile sections. 
Lucille asked Cliff 
if 
he was looking for Jim Burke's map. 
He said no, that only shows a section, Middle Branch. 
Cliff said 
Jim Burke owned quite a little bit of ground. 
Lucille said Cliff 
is waiting for something to be named after him, and chuckled. 
Cliff said Jim Burke was probably crazy. 
He lived alone. 
He 
disowned Cliff. 
He used to work with him a lot. 
Then Cliff got 
married and he didn't speak to Cliff no more. 
He lived 
in Sands 
Point in Waretown. 
Cliff found out that he bought a piece of 
property that Jim owned. 
He was married out in Terra Haute, 
Indiana. 
So what happened, Cliff doesn't know, he said. 
Probably a bad marriage, Cliff thinks. 
He didn't want nothing to 
do with marriage, Cliff said. 
He was wild like an Indian, Cliff said, as wild as they 
come. 
Cliff said he never saw anybody like him. 
He was nuts. 
But he learnt Cliff a lot of things. 
Cliff told us a story. 
On the Switch Road 
there was a fire 
coming down through there in 
1937. 
It was a bad fire, and they 
tried to stop it on the Long Ridge Road 
The fire was right on 
top of them, so they went down to the Switch Road and backfired 
and tried to stop it. 
It was right on top of them again. 
Cliff 
was with Jim and 5 other guys 
in a truck. 
They had this all 
O'Connor--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 12 
fired in and got it 
in there 50 feet or so; but then the fire was 
right on top of them. 
It went right over the top of their heads. 
Cliff thought they were going to burn up. 
So the guy that knew 
anything, he went out through the backfire out to the railroad. 
The rest of them, and Cliff didn't even know where the Switch 
Road went, had to take a chance. 
They had to go out the Switch 
Road and hope that it didn't go back in the fire. 
Luckily it 
went out of the fire. 
So the guy that knew the woods very well, 
his name was Mark Sprown, he went out with another gang and 
stopped the fire right on the railroad. 
The fire had started up 
in Bamber. 
That's the fire that 
burned into the swamp (North Branch). 
The acreage shown in the 
aerial photo, about 5-10 acres. 
That was a hot fire. 
Some of 
the guys were crying, that's how scareds they were. 
Cliff was 
only a young kid at the time. 
The other guys were mostly young. 
Jim was the oldest probably. 
He didn't know where this road 
went. 
He was new around her at that time, 
in the 30's. He didn't 
know much about those woods then. 
"That's how you learn, right. 
...almost got burnt up," Cliff said. 
(250) 
The back fire they set during that blaze went in slow. 
The main fire went right over their heads, Cliff said again. 
The 
smoke was so thick he said he thought he was going to die. 
You're breathing smoke. 
Cliff said he supposed he could name some more of the roads. 
He pointed out another cranberry bog at the head of Oyster Creek 
(the same one that he showed us on the other map I think). 
Then 
he pointed out the Barnegat Straight Road. 
It said Bay Shore 
Drive on the map. 
Nope, he had the wrong one. 
The Barnegat 
Straight Road was south of the Bay Shore Drive (Rte. 70). 
There was a place in there called Cloverdale, Cliff said. 
There 
is a cranberry bog there. 
Another Zeb Collins lived there. 
His son, Bill Collins, has the place now. 
He runs a forest fire 
tractor. 
He has a small bog that he farms, and he drives a 
school bus. 
Cliff said he 
is the guy who plows Cliff's fire 
breaks. 
Cliff said Bill 
is from the old stock. 
The area he 
lives in 
is called Cloverdale, Cliff said. 
There are 3 or 4 
houses there now. 
Next Cliff identified the Pancose Road that goes into 
Waretown. 
It goes over to Warren Grove. 
(sp? of Pancose, 
Pancoase?) 
The Jones Road comes out on Pancoast Road 
It 
actually comes into lower Waretown. 
It was the major road at 
that time. 
(345) 
The old name for Brookville was Millville. 
I found the 
Waretown—Brookville Road. 
That, Cliff said, 
is what they call 
the Barnegat Straight Road. 
It's fairly straight. 
He pointed 
out the junction where you go 
into the Albert Brothers place. 
Actually, Cliff said, there 
is another older road that also goes 
O'Connor--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 13 
below Oyster Creek. 
He found it, 
but doesn't know the name of 
it. 
It's all 
growed up. 
But it's got a name that's for sure. 
Ask a Waretowner on that, Cliff said. 
It goes into Wells Mills 
and then continues. 
People now use 532 instead of that road. 
The Waretown dump 
is right where 532 forks out. 
That's a 
county, regional, dump. 
It's a high hill right there. 
The road 
continues on and crosses the ??? Road 
That's where Cliff's 
daughter lives, he said. 
That's a high elevation, 166 feet, 
Cliff said. 
She lives 
in a log cabin there. 
Cliff asked what he 
should put for that, and Lucille said, "Rose's house." 
I said these maps aren't for information that has to be 
really accurate in terms of, 
so that other people will use 
it. 
It's more like a personal history of the place, your own personal 
history. 
Cliff said he was trying to think of the name of that road, 
damn 
it. 
(Interesting that every time I try to explain the 
mapping idea, he switches back to naming roads.) 
He thought it 
goes into Howardville and then over to Red Oak Grove. 
Side 2 
(001) 
Continuing with the roads, C►iff pointed out another road 
that goes into Cedar Run. 
He found it on the map, not labelled. 
It ran off the map we had. 
He used to know the head of the Board 
of Proprietors, his name was George Miller. 
He told Cliff a lot 
of this stuff. 
I asked if Cliff had places around Forked River that were 
important to him when he was a kid growing up, 
like where he went 
to trap. 
Lucille said to tell 
us about the cabins in 
the woods. 
Cliff tried to find one on the Jim Burke Road 
It was at the head 
of a branch. 
He marked it. 
It was on a high hill, a hundred 
foot elevation. 
The cabin was a secret hideaway when he was 
about 15. 
It was 
in the middle 30"s. 
They had a spring there 
that they put a barrel 
into 
in the hill. 
It wasn't a very big 
spring. 
They took the bottom out of the barrel, and the water 
would overflow the barrel. 
They would look 
in that barrel and 
swear that it was empty, that's how clear the water was. 
You'd 
swear it, Cliff said. 
It was just a place to go, Cliff said 
in 
response to Boris' question about whether he trapped there. 
Cliff said they had model T's and Buicks, and model A's, and all 
kinds of cars out there that they used to drive around the woods. 
His friend's father had a garage 
in Forked River. 
They had a 
Marquette and all 
kinds of big cars. 
They would get going 60 mph 
and run right off the road. 
That was going through the crazy 
stage, Cliff said. 
A big car running over 4-6 inch pine trees, 
just maul them right down. 
"That was fun, you know. 
Just like 
these motorcycles now running around with no brains. 
Same thing. 
Only we were 
in a different era," Cliff said. 
His friends were 
Bob Taylor and Herb Newman. 
It was Bob Taylor's father Dewey who 
gave them the cars. 
He had a garage right where what is now 
O'Connor--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 14 
Oyster Bay Restaurant. 
They didn't have licenses or anything. 
They even had a 
Lincoln. 
They were old, but they ran good. 
They had the woods 
all 
to themselves, except for a few people mossing, or something 
like that. 
The cars went good on the sand. 
Normally they would 
only run 15-20 mph. 
With crooked roads you might meet somebody, 
and they had to think of those things. 
They went through the 
crazy stage and survived, Cliff said. 
(075) 
Cliff said he and his friends had most of their cabins out 
around the bay. 
There was no nuclear plant when he was a kid, 
Cliff said. 
Once, 
in 1934, 
Cliff walked up 
Oyster Creek with a 
guy and the ice was 3 ft. thick. 
He saw an arrowhead clearly at 
the bottom of four feet of water. 
He never got it. 
Cliff and his friends had cabins 
in Forked River around the 
mill pond. 
He marked where he had two 
log cabins. 
Cliff was 
still 
reluctant to mark up the map. 
The cabins were about 10x 10 
feet and made of cedar. 
They would take old sailboats apart and 
use the cedar planking. 
People used to abandon sailboats along 
the creek. 
This was 
in the 30's also. 
They burnt them up when 
they got through with them. 
That's how careless they were, Cliff 
said. 
(115) 
I asked Cliff where he used to trap when he was a kid. 
He 
said he used to trap along Bridge Creek. 
Arango Creek 
is named 
on the map and 
is 
in the state game farm. 
Boris asked what he 
trapped for, and Cliff said muskrat and mink. 
Cliff used to trap 
all 
along Ridge Creek. 
There are a lot of meadows, he said. 
Sometimes he used to trap 
in Arango Creek or Middle Branch. 
Cliff said he had a sneakbox, and rowed into Ridge Creek or 
Middle Branch and come out on North Branch. 
And South Branch is 
near there too. 
That's why they call 
it Forked River, there are 
three branches. 
He trapped on all three branches. 
He did not go 
beyond the meadows. 
Cliff said he would go down there before daylight in 
the 
morning, tend his traps, and then go to school after that. 
the 
train would come at quarter to seven, and he would have to 
hightail 
it home. 
The train would come up from Barnegat. 
That 
was the end of the line for Central. 
He had a bicycle. 
There were plenty of roads. 
There were at least 500 people 
in Forked River at that time. 
He would take the Lacey Road down 
to the dock, and then take his sneakbox and go anywhere he 
wanted. 
(155) 
Boris asked 
if all 
the kids had sneakboxes. 
Cliff said 
no, 
he was probably the only one. 
His uncle gave 
it to him. 
His 
uncle also must have made it, Cliff said. 
O'Connor--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 15 
Lucille said that Cliff had built a couple of boats in this 
house. 
The kitchen and the rest of the downstairs of the house 
used to be all 
one room, Cliff said, and they built boats 
in 
here. 
They lived upstairs. 
when they got tired of 
living 
upstairs, he made these rooms down here. 
I asked him where the church was that was burned in 1930. 
Cliff said that was a Presbyterian church on Rte. 9. 
He labelled 
it on the map. 
Right where the game farm road came out the 
church was located. 
The house across the road, the Holmes house, 
burned, and that was what set the church on fire. 
What they had 
in the whole area was all 
rail fences, Cliff said. 
The fire came 
right down the rail fences and burned up everything. 
They built a brick church on that same site, Cliff said. 
One third of the town burnt. 
I asked where Steve lived. 
Lucille asked if I had seen 
Steve's house, and I said I had not gotten over there. 
Cliff 
labelled the Archer Road and at the other end of 
it 
it 
is called 
the Long Ridge Road. It's the same road, though. 
People by the 
name of Archer lived right by Steve's house. 
It's all a low 
area. 
It was never drained right, and where you have a wet area 
it 
is not good, Cliff said. 
Then Cliff pointed out and labelled 
exactly where Steve lives. 
There used to be a landing at the end 
of Archer Road where Middle Branch and North Branch come 
together. 
(230) 
They used to haul charcoal down there and take it by small 
boat out to schooners out at the mouth of the river, Cliff said. 
A schooner couldn't get up the creek. 
They used smaller boats to 
take the wood, e.g., cedar, out also. 
That was before the 
railroad, Cliff said. 
The Tuckerton railroad was around 1870, 
but the Central railroad was earlier than that, he thinks around 
1850, but doesn't know for sure. 
It went to Tom's River. 
It was 
called the Tom's River railroad on the 1857 map, I noticed. 
It's 
abandoned now up to Bayville. 
Next we put down Cliff and Lucille's house. 
Lucille brought 
in her oldest son's jr. high school project from 1958 to show us. 
He made a model 
of every tree, house, road, etc. 
in Forked River. 
He had different colors for different houses. 
He included the 
Frazee's garage. 
He was 12 when he did 
it. 
The firehouse wasn't 
there then. 
The Presbyterian church was too far up to be 
included. 
Lucille got him balsa wood to make 
it out of. 
Lucille 
said he has done a lot of beautiful things. 
Cliff said we should 
see the pair of hands he made, folded. 
Cliff said, "You've seen 
that you'll never see it again because there ain't nobody that 
could do that. 
He couldn't do 
it, 
even himself." 
Lucille asked 
if we would like to see 
it, 
and we said sure. 
Cliff said he even 
put the veins 
in the hands. 
Lucille said that he said that he 
folded the hands the way he prays. (The hands are coupled and 
folded over one another, not elongated and stretched out flat.) 
O'Connor--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 16 
I asked 
if I could use the phone while she got the hands, 
and they told me where it was. 
I couldn't find it right away, 
and when I did Cliff said, "Don't let 
it bite you." 
That's 
probably the first comment like that I've heard from him, and I 
didn't hear it until I logged the tape. 
We gradually began to 
close down our operation. 
We hadn't realized we had been there 
so 
long. 
Boris said he had not even had a chance to see the 
water. 
Lucille brought in the hands. 
They were made out of cedar. 
He put in perfect splines to stop the checking in the wood. 
Lucille and Cliff explained that their son now has 100% 
disability from the Navy. 
Cliff said, "That's a piece of work 
right there." 
Boris asked how long 
it took. 
Cliff said he had 
no 
idea, but when Boris said 
he bet it took a long time, Cliff 
said, "You better believe it." 
Lucille said that every one of 
his veins is represented, fingernails, everything. 
He had told 
her that that was the way he prayed. 
Cliff said that it was made 
out of one piece of wood. 
You have to have a lot of patience to 
do something like that, Cliff said. 
They began looking at the model of the town again. 
I was 
still 
on the phone. 
I came over then and admired the hands. 
Lucille said that Butch had made that right before he went in the 
service. 
Cliff said he thought that the hands was the greatest 
piece of work he has ever seen. 
Lucille keeps it 
in a case 
upstairs, she said. 
(405) 
Lucille offered us a piece of cheesecake. 
I said I guessed 
we would have to force one down. 
She gave me her recipe. 
It had 
just come out of the oven. 
I mentioned to Cliff that I had just 
mentioned his bottle collection to Boris. 
Cliff said that when 
he first started collecting them he couldn't find one. 
He has 
about 10,000 now. 
Cliff said that shows you how dumb you can be 
and how smart you can be. 
I said that he must know where to 
look. 
We talked about the hours of tape we have accumulated, and 
the hours of paperwork per hour of tape. 
That's all folks.

Abbot Lee inside the house; then Abbot held the mike while 
we drove to the bogs. Later, again inside Steven's house, Abbot 
left and I talked with Stephen II. Then he was the sound source. 
2MIK: 
TX01: G—Chatsworth; 27GT The first section of this interview took 
place with Abbot Lee 
in the dining room of his father, Stephen 
Lee II. Abbot used photographs as starting points in an 
explanation of how cranberry bogs worked, and what technology was 
employed in that work. 
(001) We began by talking about our respective weeks since we 
last talked. The first photo Abbot showed me was a picture of a 
group of people from China who visited the farm. That was 
in 
1981. The next shot was of the four wheel hay wagon used to move 
the pick—your—own customers from the packing house to the field. 
They put bench seats on either side of 
it, and a fence around it 
so people and produce couldn't fall off. The fence 
is high enough 
off the bed of the wagon so a flat of berries can slide under it. 
This makes 
it easier to take berries on and off the wagon. The 
wagon even has a canopy and a staircase up to 
it. 
Then he showed me a picture of Stephen III with a publisher 
from the American _Agricultural Census Magazine. He 
is shown 
explaining their new cash register, which not only keeps a record 
of where your cash comes from and how much you should have at the 
end of the day, but also keeps production records on retail 
sales. Pick you own might be 
in different fields during the day 
depending on what kind of berries they want or how busy they are 
in different things. At the end of the day 
it can tell 
you where 
O'Connor--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 18 
the production came from and how it was sold, whether it was 
bought in bulk or the people bought it pick—your—own, or however, 
and how much each person bought. 
(035) Next was a picture of the Puerto Rican workers that Abbot 
just flew to the airport on the 12th. Next he showed a picture of 
laying the "main," which 
is the large pipe down the center of the 
dam. I asked 
if the same workers worked ,year after year. Abbot 
said two of the men 
in picture are still working for the Lees. 
The picture was taken a couple of years ago. 
Back to the pipe used for the main. The largest is 
12 inches 
in diameter, and the smallest is 4 inches. The laterals that run 
through the bog from the main go down as small as 1 1/4 inches 
in 
diameter. These are used for the sprinkler system, all 
of these 
pipes. Every 60 feet of bog you have a lateral coming off the 
main pipe. 
Another picture showed workers putting in a "riser," that 
is, a small pipe joining, and perpendicular to, a lateral pipe. 
The sprinklers are hooked to these risers. These are placed every 
70 feet in the row. A bog would run 500 feet by 500 feet. 
(060) The next photo showed a John Deere side delivery hay rake. 
They took the tines off of the raking bar. They replaced these 
with knife blades. These cut the cranberry vines that are growing 
horizontally in the bog, and also delivers the vines it cuts to 
one side. The 
machine is made to be pulled by a tractor. They 
put a motor on 
it. They put a large front tire on 
it with a 
hydraulic motor that runs the machines, and another hydraulic 
motor that runs the "basket," or the knives. This machines rakes 
as fast as 100 people could rake. This 
is used every year for 2 
and 1/2 days per year, maybe three. But it accomplishes a lot (I 
should mention that we 
later went to look at these machines 
mentioned in this part of the interview. Abbot had planned this 
method of 
introducing me to the technology of cranberry farming 
once he 
learned, the week before, that I was interested.) 
I asked when this machine was used. Abbot said it was used 
in the fall, as 
late as possible after the harvest. They just 
finished using it before the workers went back to Puerto Rico. 
The 
last thing they did was raker. Abbot feels that after some 
good frost the plants are not bothered so much by driving on 
them. That is why they wait as 
long as possible. 
I asked if 
raking is 
like trimming. Abbot said that it was. 
It cuts the horizontal growth (runners), as opposed to the 
upright growth,"uprights," which are vegetative. 
Abbot replied to my question that yes, he did build the 
first one of those machines. The one in the picture was built in 
1973, and he said there a quite a few of them around now. 
O'Connor--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 19 
(080) Now we move back to 
irrigation. The next photo showed the 
edge of a dam. There is a main 
in 
it. A machine pulls the lateral 
pipe through the ground. It cuts a kerf 
in the ground and pulls 
the pipe through the kerf. It plants the pipe down about 8 or 10 
inches below the surface of the bog. Abbot said that you can pull 
a mile or so of this (pipe) per day. That pipe (lateral) will 
start at 2 inch, and the smallest will 
be 1 1/4. They never have 
gone smaller than that. 
I asked 
if they had problems with freezing water in those 
pipes. Abbot said when it gets real 
cold 
in the winter time, the 
bogs are all covered with water, so the ground never freezes 
either. The black polyethylene pipe does not freeze that easily. 
The PVC pipe 
in the dam does freeze easily, so they bury that 
pretty deep, and there 
is water on either side of 
it. They have 
never had any problem with it. The black pipe 
is flexible pipe 
also. 
Next Abbot showed me the pipe that goes from the pump down 
to the main pipe. The pipe runs at angle into the pump (about 45 
degrees). Whenever you make a turn with this pipe you have to put 
a lot of cement around it. Otherwise it will push apart when you 
start to put pressure on 
it. That piece of pipe takes a bit of 
figuring and fitting to measure it and order it to be made and 
dipped in galvanized. (The pipe is made custom according to the 
contour of the land.) 
The pump house is built right there in the shop. They do 
that during the winter, and then set it up at the site. They do 
all 
the work. 
In the photo of the slab foundation for the pump 
house, Abbot said that a man who helped them with all 
their 
building laid a string of cinder blocks around the perimeter of 
the slab. 
The pump itself 
is on wheels, the idea being that you can 
move it around if necessary. Occasionally something gets in your 
suction lines, even though they have all kinds of strainers. Fish 
or something can get in there and clog 
it. The pumps 
in the 
picture had been in place for three years, and Abbot just took 
it 
out to try 
it somewhere else. I asked if the pump was used to 
pull water as well 
as to drain water. Abbot said it could but it 
would be very slow in relation to gravity feed. Water coming 
into the bog 
is usually done by gravity feed. There is 
27,000 
gallons per acre inch. A pump like the one 
in the photo will pump 
up to 2,000 gallons per minute maximum. They get 1600-1700 
gallons per minutes of 
it. 
It would take a long while to fill 
the 30 acres that pump takes care of to put 10 inches of water in 
it. 
In an hour it would put 1 inch of water in the bog. So the 
pumps are really just to run sprinklers, for frost irrigation, or 
for irrigation otherwise, and not really to flood bogs. Some 
farmers may use the pumps to flood if they have trouble getting 
into the bogs. 
O'Connor--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 20 
You drain the bog the same way you fill 
it, 
only 
in this 
case too a lower area, back into the stream. 
(155) The next picture showed a baked enamel main going into the 
pump. They think baked enamel 
is better than galvanized, but you 
don't want to scratch it, 
so 
it 
is wrapped while concrete is 
poured around it. Abbot said they only needed a yard and half of 
cement, so they went over to get it 
in a dump truck. They made 2 
or 3 trips and got away with it. The last time they needed more 
time, so he asked the cement people to make 
it more sloppy. When 
you make cement real sloppy it hardens faster, no, 
it settled 
out, that's what happened. The bottom started to harden up, and 
not only did they have to shovel 
it around 
in the truck to keep 
the cement with stones, but it started getting hard on the 
bottom. It was a lot of work to get the cement out of that truck 
and then get the truck cleaned up. 
It was just a dump truck. It 
worked well as long as the consistency was fairly good so the 
stones didn't go to the bottom. 
(175) Next were pictures of cranberry growing in Wisconsin. I 
asked 
if their operation was much different from theirs. They do 
things quite differently, Abbot said. They have ground that is 
almost naturally level. Their vines are not overly vegetative, 
that is, horizontal runners. They can therefore use different 
types of harvesting machinery. One picture showed three pumps 
hooked into one system. The idea was that if any one of three 
went dead, another one would do the job. 
I mentioned that Mary and I had gone over to the Darlingtons 
and talked to Mark Darlington. He said that he has extra of a lot 
of things because you could lose an entire crop just like that. 
He was implying that was the nature of farming. I asked Abbot if 
he felt the same way. He said yes, what they are working towards, 
and already have, 
is the ability to 
hook up an auxiliary pump to 
the system within ten minutes (if there is a problem). They 
always have at least one person there when they are running the 
pumps. Usually the earliest they would start for frost control 
would be 9 P. 
M. and the latest it would run would 9 or 10 
in the 
morning, and that would be extreme. Many times you don't start 
the pumps until the middle of the night, and there 
is the other 
extreme when you might not start them until 5:30 in the morning 
in order to run them for a couple of hours. 
I said it seemed that he has done quite a bit of 
inventing 
He said yes, 
little things, and he guessed the hayrake is big 
deal, and aquatic water sanding has been (big), and the cranberry 
harvester. As far as the industry 
is concerned the aquatic water 
sander is probably on top because that has led to a new era 
insanding cranberries, whereas they do not lose a year's 
production. There again Abbot said, he just developed the 
machine, the 
idea was not his. His father insisted that the idea 
be developed. Abbot thought it was impossible but he did it anyway 
and 
it turned out to work real well. 
The idea goes back top a 
O'Connor--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 21 
many who used to do 
it out of little barges, and they walked 
in 
their bog and shovelled the sand off the barges by hand. And 
that goes back a hundred years ago. 
What they did was develop a barge that would support a 
machine similar to what was being used on land,but they floated it 
instead of putting it on tires. That didn't hurt the vines from 
the weight of driving on the vines. Abbot then showed me the 
picture of this machine. (This reminds me of Mark Darlington's 
attempt to make a floating cranberry harvester.) 
As far as design goes the biggest feat was finding a way to 
propel yourself back and forth 
in the water across the bottom 
without contacting the bottom. So they did this with a cable, 
in 
their case a dacron string. Some of the people who have copied 
this went to cables. They first steered it with a wheel that did 
contact the bog, but now they steer it with rudders. The sander 
grabs a hold of the ropes and pulls itself across. He showed me 
the tire that the rope wraps around. It 
is very similar to how a 
ski 
tow works, hand—held ski 
tows. Abbot's cousins made a ski tow 
ion their farm, and he got the idea from that. the rope across 
the bog 
is stationary. It wraps itself around this tire, and the 
machine grabs a hold of 
it and pulls itself. 
They started using this machine after they got it working, 
and someone from the college extension service, asked if they 
could put out a card, and anyone who wanted to see this machine 
could come and watch it. They got loading it heavier and heavier 
all 
the time, and all 
of sudden one day (Abbot happened to be 
running it.) they loaded it and he turned around and sat down and 
heard this little crack. He knew something was breaking, and he 
opened up the hopper and all 
that; but that was all kind of 
academic. And the next thing he it threw him into the dam, and 
all 
you can see of 
it 
in the photograph (just one corner is above 
water). The pontoons went flying in either direction. A brace on 
a beam had buckled and the beam broke right away. So, this 
happened just before lunch, and on the way home for lunch they 
got this card 
in the mail that said the Lee brothers had this 
aquatic sander and anybody interested in seeing it could come 
(that day). People started arriving after lunch. 
It does hold about 8-10,000 pounds of sand. The purpose of 
the machine is to put a little more than an 
inch of sand on top 
of the existing root zone, and 
it gives you a young root (system) 
that will establish itself in the area where the sand 
is on the 
vine of the cranberry. And also it covers up a lot of the leaves, 
and such, which are perfect home for insects. But the real thing 
is 
it rejuvenates the vine by giving it that new root zone. 
Cranberry is 
an evergreen which is kind of unusual. The 
popular fruits would be citrus evergreen and most everything else 
is deciduous in this area. Cranberry loses its leaves about once 
every two years. 
O'Connor--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 22 
(345) 
I asked about the level 
of the bog changing due to the 
sanding. Abbot said it doesn't seem to. 
If you put a layer of 
sand about every 7 or 8 years 
it takes quite a while to actually 
raise the level. Probably in that time span you don't realize it 
that much. The best they can do with that machine is an acre a 
day, and that's 
if they're really, things are going well. 
(355) 
Next Abbot showed me some photos of pick—your—own 
operation. The first was of a lady because of her age. She was 
in 
her 80's. People bring picnic baskets and chairs and so on (as 
seen 
in the photos and described by Abbot). 
Next Abbot showed a picture of a new ground plow. It's a 
single bottom, single furrow plow. 
It will go through heavy turf 
and slice of roots, or whatever, and invert the soil. This 
is how 
they would create a bog, I said, and Abbot agreed. 
Next, concerning the propagating of blueberries, you take 
wood or whips, off of existing blueberry plants from other 
plants, which are hopefully 18-24 inches long. You cut them into 
sections that are 4 1/2 inches long, and then you store them 
during the winter. You would probably take them around February 
and store them until Memorial Day. 
I asked how they stored the whips. Abbot said typically 
they use something like an apple storage, about 28'. They are 
packed in peat moss. This keeps them moist so they do not dry out 
in the cooler. Then around Memorial Day they are planted in a 
mixture of half and half peat moss. They'll give off roots in 
about 6 weeks or so. Then they dig the plants. The plants 
in 
the 
picture were three years old. At about three years old they dig 
the plants to be set out in the field. They get quite a root mass 
after about three years. In the hotbed they are one year. And 
then they're two more years 
in 
the nursery. 
(395) 
Next was a picture of a gentleman who had worked for 
Abbot's father since 1960, and he died back in June. He was 87 
years old and still working. He lived most of his life 
in the 
Medford area. 
In the picture he is cutting down blueberry plants 
which have been planted. The reason they cut them down 
is because 
when they put them in the ground initially you don't want all 
this top growth. They've actually had bushes blow out of the 
ground...if they have a lot of top growth. The plants, after 
planting, are trimmed down to a stub. They just finished doing 
that job, would do 
it now, and do some of 
it 
in the spring. Abbot 
said 
in response to my question about when that operation takes 
place during the year. usually you don't do 
it right in 
the 
middle of the summer. But it's important also to keep the root 
growth ahead of the top growth. If you don't you have a situation 
where the soil atmosphere gets s.aturated with water, generally 
you have an oxygen deficiency because there 
is 
less water, 
there's less air, or oxygen, 
in a water saturated soil than there 
O'Connor--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 23 
is 
in a natural soil. If you have plenty of roots 
in relation to 
top growth generally you can get through those situations for s 
period of a few days, and have a lot less die particularly when 
the bush 
is young. then when it comes for production it's easy to 
establish a bush as 
long as you have the roots to do so. 
(435) 
Next there was a picture of the bloom of blueberries. It 
looks like snow out there actually, Abbot said. With a green cast 
to 
it because the blossoms come out about the same time as the 
leaves. The leaves are not that big when the bush 
is 
in bloom. 
I asked how tall a bush should be. Abbot said depending on 
the variety, some bushes are 3 feet tall and some go between, 
around 7 feet. They average about 5 1/2 or 6 feet. 
Next is a picture of the 
sprayer that is used to spray. 
This either fungicides or pesticides in that sprayer. That is 
strictly hydraulic. 
END OF SIDE ONE 
Side Two 
(001) 
The sprayer could have been done with air blast but they 
decided they would get a little better job with strictly water 
pressure. It's a little more of a pain to run. You have 20 
nozzles you have to clean when you're done using it; but you gets 
4 or 5 nozzles, depending on how big the bushes are, over each 
row and 
it does four rows at one time. And 
if you get to the end 
and you're close 
to, 
let's say a fence, these booms will flip 
and that's all done from the tractor seat. They come around back 
(horizontally). And it's under about 500 lbs. pressure, and 
usually hydraulic sprayers are not thought to be 
low volume 
concentrate sprayers, but they spray here at about 6x. 
lx would 
be about 300 gallons of water per acre, and that's about the 
amount of water it takes to wet all 
the land surface on an acre 
of blueberries. But if 
you do something out of the ordinary, you 
can wet the entire surfaces with less water. because of the 
extreme high pressure, they get extremely fine droplet size, and 
they can easily wet everything with 50 gallons of water per acre. 
They bought the trailer with the tank on 
it, 
and Abbot made 
the boom, yea. When they started doing it they started at 100 
(gallons). That was 3x. They kept coming down until they're at 
about 50 now. Still 
it's more work to do 
it with this than an air 
blast sprayer. Some of those get down to 
10 gallons of water per 
acres. 
(027) 
Another picture of the old man, Frank Yates, who recently 
died. 
Next was a hoeing machine, which takes the grass out between 
the bushes (blueberry). Abbot made it, 
he copied the principle 
from a machine that was made 
in Michigan called the Friday Hoeing 
Machine. There's a lot of people building these hoeing machines. 
They might build another another of these this winter. But it's a 
O'Connor--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 24 
disc that spins around, and there's a feeler which feels the 
bushes. It moves in and out that way, between the bushes. The 
reason they do this 
is 
to control a fungus disease which over— 
winters the soil, and at a certain time 
it sends off spores out 
of the soil, up, and they land on the bush, the buds; and they 
start the next stage of their growth on the fruit bud, or 
whatever; and they're very devastating. 
I asked if they tried to get the rows straight. Abbot said 
the distance between the bushes is not really critical because it 
feels the bush. It doesn't do 
it 
in a timing sequence. Next he 
showed me another version. The gear box 
is made in another 
country and then imported. The problem is, 
it's a great piece of 
engineering, but the way the mechanical gear box works, however, 
the breakdowns are pretty high. The principle is the same though. 
I asked what he meant by calling the imported machine strictly 
mechanical. Abbot said there's hydraulic. When you say hydraulic 
sprayer you mean the particles of the pesticide are being moved 
in a medium of 
liquid, which 
is water, to the bush. 
When he says 
that a machine other than that, other than a sprayer, 
is 
hydraulic, he means that mechanical motion is done 
in oil; but 
then the oil 
is returned and used over and over again. 
(058) 
Next Abbot showed a picture of fertilizer application, 
and next a picture of burnig around the perimeter of the field. 
It 
is a good idea to burn around the perimeter whenever you can. 
It helps with several different insects, to control 
insects, 
particularly a couple of 
insects that have to 
leave the blueberry 
field and find a particular species of plant life 
in the area 
surrounding the field over the winter. As long as 
it doesn't hurt 
the trees (the burning). 
They do 
it to keep underbrush down, so 
if you have a wild fire in April at least you have a chance of 
stopping it. 
They do that on as much of the farm woodlot as they 
can. 
(070) 
Next was a picture of a blueberry harvester designed by 
a man named Harvey in Michigan. 
It's called the Harvey 
Harvester. 
The fingers of the machine shake the berries off the 
bush. 
They land on the datching discs, and they roll 
into the 
conveyors on either side of the row. 
I asked what keeps the 
leaves and stuff out of there. 
Abbot said they go back through 
the conveyor and fall through a wind tunnel, and the leaves come 
out. 
The wind blows the leaves out, and the berries fall through 
the wind tunnel 
into the lugs below. 
They have one of these blueberry picking machines. 
There is 
a period of about a week or so 
in there when they have to run the 
machine almost day and night to get by with one machine. 
He said 
by day and night he means as 
long as the bushes are dry. 
By 
about 12 at night dew begins to form on the berries, so you have 
to stop. 
A machine now 
is about $80,000, so you get by with one. 
It shakes the branches but does not break them. 
You pull these 
trailers behind you on either row, and that's where they put the 
O'Connor--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 25 
picked fruit. 
when they get to the end, they load 
it on a truck 
to go 
into . . 
I asked what happens to 
it then. 
Abbot said when it gets 
into the packing house 
it goes through another wind tunnel. 
and 
then after that, and this 
is a large wind tunnel that does a 
better job, 
it goes off on a moving table with a conveyor belt, 
where probably 6 people will be sitting there and watching the 
berries go by, and pick out anything that shouldn't go by. 
And 
the berries that that machine picks are capable of being packed 
fresh fruit. 
In that period when they are real busy, that's what 
they are usually doing, packing fresh fruit. 
And they really 
feel they put out a nice package; the berries are not quite as 
blue because of the mechanical handling, but the berries have all 
been sorted, and they have never been touched by anybody. 
And 
they feel 
it 
is a real 
nice package they put out that way. 
And 
usually the bulk volume, well they have pretty good volume 
without the machine too. 
But it seems like 
it 
is a lot of work 
then because you do all putting in cups and all 
is done 
in the 
packing house. 
And that's when they're busiest, when they are 
in 
the packing house. 
(100) 
Abbot said that he thought last week we talked about 
flood gates, which allow water to go from one bog to another. 
This picture shows a dam built in front of the gate, and the gate 
is down into the water about four or five feet. 
The gate 
is 
pine, the part that is always under water. 
And 
in the picture 
they are putting in these new uprights which are creosoted, which 
are sometimes exposed to air/water/air/water; and they're digging 
down (in the photo) and putting these new uprights on. 
abbot 
said he was probably 22 years old when they did that. 
Abbot then explained how the gate box 
is constructed. 
I 
wasn't thinking of a box when I was thinking of the term gate 
before. 
(See PFP83—CM0009) 
At this point Stephen II entered the room and asked how 
everything was going. 
I said fine, especially with the help of 
the pictures. 
(125) The next picture showed the knives clearly on the pruning 
machine mentioned earlier. 
Stephen II asked if I would like a cup of coffee, and I said 
that would be nice, thanks. 
Abbot then showed me a picture of a machine he made to cut, 
before they had a herbicide, bifursate, 
labelled, one of the main 
controls they had for grass was to go through in the summertime 
and cut the top of tall grasses off before it would go to seed. 
And the lightweight mower (in the picture) did just that. 
There 
are three lawnmower blades underneath the shield above them. 
It's like three thirty inch mowers, Abbot said. 
O'Connor--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 26 
I said that he does a nice clean job on these machines 
That's a good looking machine. 
Abbot said most people use just a 
fence wire. 
But from running them quite a lot you're always 
getting little bits and pieces of cut grass 
in your face. 
and 
this 
is a real 
lightweight galvanized metal. 
Abbot designed and 
made 
it himself. 
The frame 
is made out of pipe. 
It's multi— 
functional I noted, after Abbot said it hooks on with four bolts, 
and a weed wiper can be placed on after the mower is removed. 
(He doesn't have a picture of the weed wiper.) 
There are a series of pulleys to get the speed correct for 
the blades, and there's a brake, so 
if the operator is not on it, 
it can't creep into him or something. 
The operator is 
in a sulky 
behind it. 
They don't use the sulky anymore, they just walk 
behind it. 
It's more practical. 
(160) 
Next he showed me a machine they built in 
'67. 
It's 
still working. 
They sold 
it a couple of years ago when they 
built the other machine. 
It 
is a cranberry harvesting machine. 
When the cranberries have been knocked off the vines into the 
water, they float obviously; and boards 5/4 of an 
inch thick and 
four inches wide are tied together, and corral the berries into 
one corner. 
(This is shown 
in a picture.) 
The wind helps to get 
the berries into one corner, and then this conveyor goes down 
into the water, and you push the berries onto the conveyor here; 
and they get gobbled up and up they go. 
that's another job he 
always hated as a kid, Abbot said, was pushing their berries on 
these elevators. 
They made this loader which is a series of 
paddles which mechanically go, and . . . all 
you really have to 
do 
is get the berries near this elevator now. 
I asked if this type of 
inventing was 
in retaliation against 
jobs he hated as a kid. 
Abbot said that was always a primary 
motive for anybody who builds farm machinery. 
If you're doing 
something which is particularly repetitious, particularly boring, 
and maybe more important, physically strenuous, that's always a 
great catalyst to get the mind thinking how else it could be 
done, which was very true with the raking, the pruning mechanism. 
This applies to work 
in the packing house as well, Abbot said, 
and while he described this, he mentioned drying the cranberries. 
I asked if they dried them all. 
He said they are dried only for 
purposes of seeing if they are good or not. 
since they are all 
going to be frozen, 
it doesn't matter whether they're wet or not. 
The cranberry really bounces. 
The berries hit a board (in the 
picture) and start rolling down the conveyor belt, which is 
actually running in the opposite direction. 
and the leaves don't 
bounce as far, and they fall down. 
Of course, they don't roll, 
they stick to the conveyor belt; and they go up and the berries 
roll 
down. 
It's that initial bounce that frees the berries 
Stephen runs the packing house, Abbot said, and he . . . it was a 
while before they found out how important this board was, a 
simple board that the berries hit and bounce at an angle that 
O'Connor--83 Audiocassette logs

sends the berries down. 
More pictures of the 
mean more when we go 
packing house. 
Abbot said they would 
down to see the packing house. 
They did. 
Next Abbot showed me a picture of a weed wiper. 
The 
chemical 
is applied to a belt and 
it wipes it on the grass 
without hitting the vines. 
There are lots of different ve 
of these, Abbot said. 
This is for cranberries. 
The grass 
be about 8-10 inches above the vines. 
The belt is one that will not 
made out of the material used 
packing. 
That stuff 
is . . . 
far greater than a sponge. 
Ab 
bed ridden for quite a while, 
came from. 
Oh, no 
it isn't ei

nursing home, and of course th 
to another, and 
if people didn 
used it to wash the car, and t 
one time, and with that knowle 
also that it was a great spong

and he guesses that was th 
the stuff. 
He had never tried 
rsions

be affected by water. 
It 
is 
in hospitals that looks like egg 
the absorption ability of that is 
bot had an uncle, he said, who was 
and he guesses that is where it 
ther, he said. 
A girl who worked 
r father was administrator of a 
ey never used it from one patient 
't take 
it . . . her father only 
hey gave the Lees a big sheet of 
it 
dge, they gave them the knowledge 
e. 
So Abbot thought he would try 
e first he had ever even touched 
to make a weed wiper before. 
(255) 
I said it was remarkable how these inventions 
place. 
It 
is 
so practical. 
You need something, to not 
change, but modify something. 
Abbot said yes and you work 
the things around you. 
I said 
it seems like a little 
modification is made and then another. 
Abbot said, yes, 
of . . . 
took 
totally 
with 
a series 
Another way of sanding cranberries besides aquatic sanding, 
Abbot said at this point, 
is 
on the ice. 
When you have enough 
ice to support a truck. 
That's typical 
in Wisconsin where 
they'll get a foot or more of 
ice, maybe up to 3 feet of ice. 
NJ 
it takes about 8-10 inches of 
ice to support a truck, and you 
might get a couple of days every three years or something. 
When 
those couple of days happen, they want to be ready to go, Abbot 
said, because you get as good a job as you do with the aquatic 
sanding, but you don't lose a year's production. 
You can do 
in a 
day what it would take a week to do with the aquatic sander. 
(He 
showed me a picture of a truck on the 
ice while he discussed 
this.) 
They dig sand on their own land, and go quite deep when they 
dig through the top crust (during the winter I think). 
I asked 
if 
they go as far as water level. 
Abbot said they go as far 
the machine will reach. 
Usually that is not to water level. 
Back to the truck 
the truck dumps. 
on the 
ice. 
The scraper scrapes the sand 
It 
is about an inch—thick layer of sand. 
O'Connor--83 Audiocassette logs

as 
In 
Next more gate pictures. 
One board got loose 
in the gate 
shown and sand began to get washed out. 
What was a hole became a 
thirty foot wide gap 
in the dam, and let all 
the water out of the 
reservoir. 
They got their neighbor to help them stop it off, the 
Haineses. 
This occurred right during cranberry season, so they 
had to have the water, Abbot said. 
At this point Stephen II brought in the coffee. 
(320) 
Next some pictures of the packing house. 
The cement 
building was built in 1961, and the rest of 
it was built in 1966 
(of the one building). 
The other building was built in 1980. 
(Again see PFP83—M0009.) 
It 
is a metal building, the latter. 
After they built 
they weren't particularly fond of 
it because 
the inside seemed so vulnerable. 
So they cut pine about 1/2 inch 
thick and they put wood panelling around the inside of the 
building, about 8 feet up, to protect it. 
And they haven't been 
as worried about it since then, Abbot said. 
They are a lot 
cheaper than masonry buildings, and fast to put up. 
they can 
build them in a few days. 
Next a picture of cranberry bogs in the winter time. 
I 
noticed that it must be flooded all winter, right up to the 
surface (of the dam). 
Abbot said, yes, they try to cover all the 
vines. 
Another picture of Frank Yates. 
He had tomatoes out 
there behind his house, and they were as tall 
as he was. 
I said he seemed like a person close to the family, and both 
Stephen and Abbot agreed. 
Stephen II said he was typical of the 
old generation. 
He was very proud of his work. 
He'd tell 
you 
exactly how many bushes he pruned. 
He was really quite a person. 
He was sharp; formal education, very little, but as far as 
mathematics, he could do 
it all 
in his head. 
He could add a 
column of figures, or divide and give you the square feet of the 
thing, or . . . he was unbelievable at mathematics. 
Next more pictures of bogs. 
We discussed the surfacing of a 
bog. 
One of the pictures showed one of the old bogs on the 
property. 
They used 12 foot ditches to carry water in those 
days, Stephen said. 
Next Abbot showed me the new cranberry harvester that he 
invented. 
Next he showed a picture of a fellow doing some liquid 
fertilizer work. 
There is going to be a demonstration at the 
Lees next Wed. 
This is a fellow working for this fertilizer 
company who has done all 
this on his own. 
even though you are 
using the same amount of nutrient (with liquid fertilizer) per 
acre as with dry granular you see a substantial difference. 
You 
rarely see a result with fertilizer, Abbot said. 
O'Connor--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 29 
(400) 
Abbot went to get more pictures. 
Stephen showed me a 
digital readout panel that goes to 888 when your electric has 
been off just for an 
instant so you know right away. 
The 
temperature comes up too. 
And 
it gives you the low and the high 
for the last 24 hours; and it has an alarm on 
it. 
They set 
theirs at 45 degrees, Stephen said. 
Then they know they're about 
10-12 degrees different from the bogs; and that tells you to go 
down and check your temperatures down there. 
It's quite a nice 
deal, Stephen said. 
I said I was just beginning to get a picture of what 
cranberry growing is 
all 
about, and 
it amazes me how in touch you 
have to be with the time and temp. every day. 
Stephen said, yea, 
that most people think you put water on them (bogs) in the winter 
time and forget about it. 
They don't have to worry about a 
muskrat hole, Stephen asked Abbot if he had told me that. 
they 
make a circle every day and check it. 
and you can tell 
if there 
has been a muskrat working if 
you check on the opposite side from 
where the water is. 
Abbot said there 
is never a day, you always 
have to be around. 
I said it's like dairy farming. 
Abbot said 
it doesn't require the hours every day.

Some more pictures. 
The next one was an old one of 
Stephen and people he knows picking blueberries with a "rake." 
It was unusual to be close to the truck as they were in that 
picture. 
(See BLDG 
MO) 
You would have to walk all 
the way 
to the main road with a box of blueberries on your back, and 
while you were gone the guy scooping along side of you, 
if 
the 
berries were good, he made a wide path, and 
if the berries were 
bad he would make a bath that long (long and narrow). 
On the 
back of the photo 
is a list of who 
is 
in 
it. 
(I 
have a photo of 
that list also.) 
Included are Bill Haines's uncle, the father of 
the man who works for Ocean Spray as a representative, named 
Sequoia, and others. 
Next was a picture of a harvester with an 18 foot wide 
rotary apparatus/device/etc. 
Abbot said that they saw one 30 
feet wide once. 
He said 18 feet was the smallest you would want 
to use. 
anything less and you should go to a different machine. 
Next were some pictures with the harvester at work, and 
Abbot gave me a flyer showing the harvester he invented. 
We 
O'Connor--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 31 
discussed the quality of the pictures he had taken and his 
camera. 
They were remarkably clear, especially the ones with the 
harvester in them. 
We talked about shooting at high speeds for 
c 
I 
a 
r 
i 
ty. 
Abbot said the harvester combs the berries off the vine. 
I 
said 
it doesn't look 
like 
it bobs that deep. 
Abbot said it 
isn't. 
One of the differences between this machine and the other 
harvester is the diameter of the tires. 
Instead of being wide 
tires to get the flotation, these are tires that are only 12 
inches wide and about 4 feet in diameter; and they don't leave 
the mark then, when you have a tire that's two feet wide, the 
swirl that pushes the vines aside. 
Abbot said that when you are driving the machine you look to 
see where the berries have been picked. 
You can see the line of 
picking 
in the pictures. 
You always go 
in the same direction 
each year, Abbot said, so you are always pulling the vines 
in the 
same direction each year. 
If you went in the opposite direction 
it would rough them all 
up. 
It's a circular motion from the 
outside to the center. 
They always go clockwise--Abbot said, but 
it makes no difference as 
long as you keep doing 
it the same way. 
And you do much less damage this way (harvester) than you do with 
the hand scoop. 
(070) 
I asked when wet harvestin' really took over. 
Abbot 
said that this principle of picking cranberries with the water 
wheel was first developed in 1949 in Mass. 
That's going back to 
the time he was born, Abbot said. 
And 
it was pretty much ignored 
until the late 50s. 
Or say 1960. 
Then they picked up on 
it and 
started harvesting all 
their fruit this way 
it went like 
wildfire, and 
it was kind of 
like 
it was the main single item of 
technology that kept the industry in business during an 
inflationary period. 
Instead of gathering 60% of the crop 
it was 
possible to gather close to 100% of the crop. 
So they were 
getting more production per acre and they were not doing the 
damage to the vines by scooping them, so their production went 
up; 
and all this was costing less to do. 
So 
it was probably one 
of the biggest technological advances the industry's ever made. 
And for many years it helped them, when the price of cranberries 
were, was poor in the early 60s; 
it was a time to, that kept them 
in business, actually. 
Then they had other things, corn sweeteners was one. 
They 
have helped them to keep the prices down and still keep profits at 
the same level because of technological advances, of doing things 
more efficiently. 
They use sweeteners derived from corn and not 
sugar cane 
in making many of the products (relating to 
cranberries). 
Ocean Spray was 
in the front in that, Abbot said. 
(100)RE the flyer with the picture of the harvester on 
it, 
Abbot said he actually physically built the machine in the 
picture. 
Then he developed the Speedwell Equipment Co. 
The Lee 
O'Connor--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 32 
Bros. built the machine in 1967. 
Abbot drew that and specified 
how it should be made, and it worked fairly well, he said. 
It 
was a long way from being perfected, and he always wanted to 
perfect it. 
The farm never had the need to perfect it 
'cause it 
worked. 
So Abbot decided he was going to go on his own then and 
perfect the machine and sell 
it to somebody. 
Then 
if 
it worked 
good they would probably keep it here. 
He always had 
it 
in the 
back of his mind that it would be nice to sell 
it to a company 
that would reproduce them professionally because most machinery 
that is made in the cranberry industry is kind of done 
in 
the 
welding shop—type thing and not really manufactured. 
They look 
like they're made 
in welding shops and not assembly lines. 
So he did just that. 
He set up a sole proprietorship and 
called it the Speedwell Equipment Co. for the reason of being an 
OEM, or an original equipment manufacturer because when you are a 
legitimate OEM there 
is a big price advantage to purchasing 
hardware, 
like engines and hydraulic motors and things of this 
nature, wheels. 
You can buy right directly from the manufacturer 
in some cases. 
And he named the machine the Easy 318. 
Abbot 
said they did go along with the name he gave it. 
He built the 
thing and 
it was not perfected. 
It had problems, but it was 
working better than any other machine around, by far the most 
powerful harvester around. 
There was not a single chain, or 
drive sprocket in the power train, which was good because even 
though he had built it, 
it still had professional design in 
it 
because he didn't have to make complex mechanical parts. 
Everything was bought and 
it was done simple so that all you had 
to do was say, bolt the hydraulic motor to this wheel 
transmission which 
is made by another company, Fairfield. 
It 
wasn't like he took sprockets and chains and made something that 
looked like it was homemade. 
the bottom line 
is . . . it was 
something that would probably run for twenty years and not break 
down, ok. 
The things that really mattered, that had any type of 
mechanical sophistication at all were not made by him, Abbot 
said, with the grinder and all 
that. 
they were made by a 
professional manufacturer. 
(150)So Abbot said he wrote a lot of letters and made a 
video tape of 
it, 
and sent it to a lot of companies. 
And this 
BEI, this man who owned it, 
he came 
in and he wanted to buy 
it 
before the thing had ever rolled out of the garage. 
And Abbot 
said he said no, 
let's wait till 
it's finished. 
He had seen 
it 
this far through. 
So he was here when it was working in the bogs 
(the manufacturer). 
He wanted it really bad. 
And no one else 
Abbot had written to had shown any real 
interest, he said. 
There 
was another company from NY . . . that would come and talk for 
half a day and you wouldn't see them for another few weeks. 
and 
Chisel—Rider which makes great harvesters were interested, but 
they weren't aggressively seeking it. 
So it seemed . . . . This 
company definitely had the ability to make a professionally--(You 
could) just look at 
it and it would look 
like any other piece of 
farm machinery. 
They could build five or ten of them and they 
O'Connor--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 33 
would still 
look like they rolled off an assembly line and not 
made 
in somebody's little shop somewhere. 
So he was real 
impressed with that, Abbot said. 
Then the owner sold the company, 
which probably didn't have a lot to do with it, Abbot said. 
The company did build five of them. 
But after they bought 
the co. from them all they did was pay Abbot for making the first 
one and for the hardware at his cost for the first one. 
And he 
was going to get a royalty on the sold thereafter. 
There was a 
big difference (geographical) between them, and they (t.he co.) 
kind of went off 
in their own direction. 
And a lot of 
it they 
copied, but there's a lot they didn't. 
And they had structural 
problems. 
Places where this had never bent or never broken. 
The 
thing that really annoyed Abbot, he said, was the reason they had 
that problem was they tried to do something that he had also 
tried to do, but the geometry of 
it he could not work out. 
and 
he thinks 
it was just physically impossible to do. 
And 
it had to 
do with transport on the road. 
They got themselves extended too 
far. 
They also had another safety problem, which Abbot says he 
told them about before, 
in May. 
They wrote him and said they 
would cross that bridge when they came to it. 
Then in August 
they had a demonstration in Mass. 
It was a nice looking machine. 
They were loading that machine on the truck to bring here because 
the new people who had bought the company wanted Abbot to work 
with 
it. 
It got on the truck and exactly what he said could 
happen did happen. 
The thing broke itself right off the truck. 
The operator had absolutely no control over it. 
He ended up 
underneath the thing, and he wasn't even seriously hurt. 
He 
could have been killed. 
He was just lucky. 
On the machine at 
the Lees there 
is a button on the gear shift that if anything 
happens . . . you just push this button and everything freezes. 
The poor guy running that machine, he . . . . It had just 
been assembled, and something got loose, and it allowed one of 
the drive wheels to start moving and the other one wouldn't; and 
it just drove itself right off the truck. 
He had absolutely 
nothing he could do about it. 
It was a split second decision and 
if 
you have that button right there at your fingertips you just 
push 
it. 
So at this point they had made 5 of these machines and spent 
all 
this money and they realized they were nowhere. 
they haven't 
done anything in two years. 
And they sent this, they were 
supposed to get a new machine, 
it was one of the considerations, 
to use here. 
They still have the one that Abbot built. 
Well, 
they still don't have any machine (for Abbot). 
He says they're 
kind of dragging their feet. 
Abbot thinks that if 
they had worked together on the machine 
for a year they could sell 5 or 10 of them per year. 
After I 
asked, Abbot said he still did have the Speedwell Equipment Co. 
O'Connor--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 34 
It's inactive. 
There's $12 in the checking account. 
What scared him away from Speedwell Equip. Co. was, after he 
had sold the machine . . . . You know what product liability is, 
Abbot said to me. 
Like with recall how drastic they can be. 
And 
he said he 
is the developer of this thing, and even though he was 
going to sell 
all 
the development rights, he was still worried 
about sometime, say an accident like that. 
That was definitely a 
case of poor design. 
That wasn't Abbot's fault, he said, but how 
about something he had designed, even 
if 
he had designed it 
in 
good faith; but it did lead to someone getting hurt. 
Even though 
the company bought it, 
the responsibility could conceivably come 
back to him, Abbot thinks. 
This 
is just part of the machinery 
business. 
If you're big enough to be 
in the machinery business. 
To assume all this liability was kind of a scary thing, Abbot 
said 
(260) So Abbot said the machinery business is not a business 
for small people. 
As 
is the patenting. 
The probably spent 
$15,000 just to get the patents on this thing. 
they had 47 
patent applications in on this one machine, and Abbot said he 
proofread it for them. 
You can imagine what it cost to have 
lawyers draw in and describe every little part that is on this 
machine, Abbot said. 
The brochure that Abbot gave me cost the 
company $5000 to put out. 
And Abbot was very lucky, he said. 
He had close to $16,000 
in hardware in this machine. 
Plus his time. 
And he was lucky, 
he got rid of 
it at that point. 
Maybe 
if he had 
it to do over he 
would have kept it another year and perfected it, Abbot said, and 
probably spend another ten thousand. 
He thinks for another ten 
thousand he could have perfected the thing. 
(280) I asked if other people around here used any of his 
machines. 
Abbot said the Haineses use the aquatic sander. 
they 
have done up to 130 acres 
in one year. 
If you make something and 
it works, everyone is always more than happy to 
lett their 
neighbors use their ideas, with very few exceptions. 
and this 
(the harvester) would have been an exception, obviously. 
Abbot 
said he did sign something that said that the co. had exclusive 
rights to his knowledge about how to make a cranberry harvester. 
It would have been for the well being of the industry because it 
would have been the first time that you would have had a 
professionally built . . . and all 
these machines would have been 
built alike, and there would have been parts numbers, and a 
service truck 
in the area, and all 
that, which means so much, 
particularly on a machine that is so important for such a short 
period of time. 
Would you rather buy a car from an automobile 
producer, say General Motors, or would you rather buy a car from 
someone who has made two cars; and then they go off and start 
making bicycles. 
If you go to them for a part, they're going to 
scratch their head and say, "Now what did that look like?" 
(320) I asked how much a Mighty Easy 318 would cost. 
Abbot 
O'Connor--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 35 
said they had a price of $30,000 on 
it. 
He thinks that was a 
fair price 
if they had developed it. 
Abbot thinks they could 
have sold them at that. 
that was twice what it would have cost 
parts and labor, and that is pretty much standard. 
After you 
sold 20 or 25 of them you would have paid for the research and 
development plus the bricks and mortar in the plant and all 
that 
stuff, Abbot said. 
Abbot said that it 
is worth it to his family 
to buy something that is professionally built rather than doing 
it themselves (and pay more for that machine). 
that goes for the 
other equipment around the farm too, he said. 
As long as 
it 
is 
professionally built and well designed they would rather pay more 
for it. 
They think this 
is sound business practice. 
I mentioned the Darlington's blueberry picking machine that 
I saw yesterday. 
Abbot said that that was a good machine. 
It 
picks as well as any machine. 
The only problem with amy machine 
that employs a fan 
is that the quality of the berries isn't as 
good because when they hit the screen, 
it catches them. 
There's 
quite a degree of bruising done. 
for the Darlington's this 
is 
quite academic, Abbot said, since they process all their berries. 
What stopped Tom Darlington from going any further was the 
blueberry picking business was so tied up 
in patent conflicts, 
and Tom is mechanically oriented, whereas Abbot is hydraulically 
oriented, Abbot said. 
He likes sprockets and chains and things, 
and the laws of doing things that way. 
Tom Darlington developed 
what is known as the Darlington harvester, Abbot said, which is a 
dry scooping device, which is a really clever machine. 
that was 
patented and marketed out of Mass. 
He also has some other things that he has developed, Abbot 
said. 
Before he got active raising cranberries he probably did a 
lot more (inventing) than he does today. 
I mentioned that 
they 
were working on a floating harvester. 
Abbot said, yes, that they 
had sold Whites bog to the state. 
and then they have been 
renting it ever since; and some of 
it 
is 
so uneven, water is very 
deep; and he knows they have been looking, building a new machine 
just to pick that property that they're renting. 
They took the 
money that they sold 
it for, and they went right across the 
street, and within a period of about 5 years they developed that 
property across the street. 
There's about 130 acres 
in there, 
Abbot thought. 
I said I thought there was more. 
Abbot said that 
was ideal, to have all that money to do 
it all at one time. 
It's 
like a model cranberry farm. 
(420) 
I talked a little about the bogs over at Darlington's, 
and how fascinating the cranberry business was, and how the 
machinery seemed so tied 
in on a day to day basis, and 
it seemed 
that a lot of the machines were just used for a short time, but 
have to be as productive as possible. 
Abbot said that his father had some pictures and articles 
that he wanted to show me. 
We arranged to go on the tour of the 
bogs and the packing house and that I would then come back and go 
O'Connor--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 36 
over things with his father. 
At this point we began to go 
outside. 
END OF SIDE ONE 
SIDE TWO 
(001) 
As we prepared to 
leave, I asked Abbot if he would hold 
the lavalier, as we drove to the bogs. 
I said I had found that I 
could never really tell when a conversation was going to get 
interesting. 
(I guess I probably meant that they often get 
interesting at times like this, of transition.) 
As we were leaving, Stephen II pointed out one of the high 
tempered steel cutting knives on the table, that are used 
in the 
pruning machine. 
We talked about what a beautiful, and warm, day 
it was and Stephen remarked that it was a big day for football. 
Abbot said 
it was probably the last day for high school football, 
and Stephen said it was a big day for the Ivy League. 
He was 
referring to the Penn vs. Dartmouth game on TV and the possible 
Ivy championship at stake. 
I missed the point and had to ask him 
to clarify this at the time. 
Stephen said he used to go to the 
games and sit with the alumni because a radiologist he knew went. 
I said I go to all 
the basketball games. 
As we got near the corner of Speedwell and Rte. 563 Stephen 
pointed out the site of the house that used to be the main house. 
Abbot said the foundation is still there. 
We headed for the bogs first. 
They are a mile or so further 
south of Chatsworth than Speedwell Rd. 
As we turned right into 
the bogs across the street from the packing house, Stephen 
pointed out that what was now blueberry field near the road used 
to be a swimming pool; but people driving along threw bottles 
into 
it. 
Gradually as they cleaned out their ditches they filled 
it 
in and turned it back into blueberries. 
Next on the left we passed a blueberry nursery that was one 
year of growth out of the hotbeds. 
So those plants are two years 
old. 
They're developing roots and not top growth at this stage. 
(They looked like small blueberry bushes, and were not enclosed 
in any way.) 
(060) Next, on the right about 100 yards into the blueberry 
fields and bog area--we had not reached the bogs yet--there was a 
pile of bog iron on the right. 
(See PFP83-CM0009) 
Abbot said 
that was the way it 
looked in the ground, albeit a little old and 
broken down. 
That's in sheets, he said. 
Stephen said it came 
just like cement slabs, and 
is mixed with stone, but the iron is 
in there. 
He said pure iron doesn't rust. 
(Later Stephen got 
out a picture of a pig iron, and I photographed it (see PFP83-
CM0009). 
At this point I got out and photographed the bog 
iron. 
I asked how much of that iron 
is around here, and Abbot said 
that was a very good question. 
That was just what they dug out 
O'Connor--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 37 
that was 
in the way when they were digging the irrigation, Abbot 
said. 
It was actually in the dams; when they dug down to put the 
mains 
in those pieces came out. 
Abbot said he thought the reason the industry left this area 
(iron industry) was that the amount of 
iron 
in that (bog iron) as 
compared to . . . . At this point Stephen said to come back 
in 
the car, 
it was cold. 
Stephen II continued where Abbot left off 
and said that it took a lot of heat to melt the bog iron down, 
and that meant lots of acres of trees cut. 
We passed some blueberry bush rows that had been out up 
between the rows but had not been rotivated yet (plowed but not 
turned over). 
Abbot asked his father if 
it wasn't so that the 
percentage of 
iron 
in the bog iron was less than they found 
in 
Pennsylvania. 
Stephen said yes. 
Next we passed blueberry bush rows before they have been 
chopped up. 
I noted that when the bushes were pruned the 
trimmings were left in the rows between bushes. 
And Stephen said 
that then they were chopped up. 
Abbot said they had a machine 
for this that was like a big 
lawn mower. 
I asked if they were always adding to their fields. 
Stephen 
said they tear one out and put another one 
in. 
Abbot said 
lately, 
instead of adding new fields, his father had been 
changing varieties. 
Next we passed a section of three year old blueberries, at 
the size they like to transplant them to the regular fields. 
(Refer to notes 
in PFP83—AM0004). 
Abbot said it 
is from these 
bushes where they will also get the growth, the cuttings for the 
hotbed mixture. 
They are not taken from producing fields, he 
said. 
These (3 year old plants) are what they call mother 
plants. 
The real difference is that these have been inspected 
for diseases. A mother plant usually refers to a plant used to 
produce wood (cuttings). 
Next we passed the site of a new pump house. 
Stephen said 
that will supply all 
up there where the nursery is, and three 
other fields (the sprinklers). 
He said they can all 
run at one 
time, or you can do them individually in each field. 
I asked 
where the water was coming from. 
Stephen said from a stream 
above here and goes back (into it). 
These ditches (on our right as we drove around the bogs on 
our left; the road being on top of a border dam) go all 
through 
the property, Abbot said, and by the amount of boards they put in 
front of a flood gate, that determines the height of the water in 
the ditch. 
At dry times they have the water as high as they can 
in the ditch, Abbot said; and then the water infiltrates out into 
the field. 
If 
it's real wet, 
like 
it 
is now, from all 
the rain 
we've had, they take the boards out, they get the ditches low, 
O'Connor--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 38 
and that helps the land to drain. 
So a ditch 
is both a draining 
ditch and an 
irrigation ditch. 
I asked how far the water will 
drain into a field. 
Abbot said this particular field (we were 
passing) 
is 900 feet between ditches one way and about 1200 feet 
the other way. 
Water moves quite slowly in that direction 
(horizontally). 
(145) Stephen then showed me an area on the right of the road 
and the bogs that were 
open, no trees. 
When the furnace (iron) 
was here that was called the "ore beds." 
And that was one of the 
places where the ore was mined, and 
if you walked out in there, 
Stephen said, now and you could take a bamboo fishing pole, say 
15 or 18 feet and push 
it through and go right down into a cavity 
that was just a mass of grass and vines and all 
that growed over 
the top of 
it; 
and you shake and you could stand there and jump 
this way and 
it would be 
like standing on a bed; and they called 
it the ore beds. 
Abbot interjected that you wouldn't walk out 
there now. 
And Stephen said, no, well you could go up to your 
waist very easy. 
So they had quite a bit of trouble where they 
could go when they were developing in there, Stephen said, 
because they were getting 
in to that, and it doesn't pay. 
Next 
we passed an area used for sand to sand the cranberries. 
Abbot said the stream they diverted through the farm goes 
out through the woods, and 
if that stream comes in 
it could 
eventually get too high and flood the bogs at a crucial time so 
they have the dam to protect the bogs. 
(This section was very 
muffled.) 
(160) I asked what the size of the bogs were. 
Abbot said the 
ones we were passing were 4 acre bogs. 
They used to make them 
smaller, he said, so you could keep them exactly the same level, 
and you could flood them best for frost control. 
However, with 
irrigation you're probably going to make bogs . . . . (muffled). 
Stephen then pointed out the stream on the other side of the 
sluiceway. 
He said water can either go out the stream or go back 
to a neighbor. 
I asked how many acres they had in blueberries now. 
Abbot 
said he guessed there was about 65 acres. 
We passed some gates. 
Stephen said they're built at a slant so the pressure of the 
water holds the boards together. 
(Need a drawing of a gate.) 
Next we passed an area that Abbot is preparing to be a bog. 
I asked if 
he had just burned it. 
That is what it 
looked like. 
Abbot said the trees were pushed down, then piled. 
They burned 
what would burn and then pulled the piles apart. 
I asked about 
the next steps. 
He said after levelling it, 
they would haul 
in 
hundreds and hundreds of truckloads of sand. 
Stephen said it's 
almost level 
now. 
Stephen pointed out a working pump house that 
worked about 4 bogs. 
We passed more gates, and I asked how often 
they have to put a gate. 
Stephen, after thinking I meant time 
O'Connor--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 39 
and answered that he couldn't tell, said that it depends on the 
size of the bog. 
Abbot said the gate 
is about 2 feet by 4 feet, 
and that will handle an awful 
lot of water, he didn't remember 
how much. 
He would guess 
it would handle about 25,000 gallons of 
water per minute. 
I saw some lateral pipes 
in the bog, and Stephen said there 
is a main right down the middle of the dam. 
I asked if Abbot had 
already pruned the bogs this year, and he said he had. 
Another 
garbled section of tape here (230-245). 
Stephen talked about different sections of blueberry fields 
planted in different varieties. 
I asked 
if they had one or two 
that grew the best. 
He said yes, I think he said "snow crop" but 
couldn't tell. 
(250) 
I asked Abbot if the mike and recorder was giving him a 
problem. 
He said not at all. 
Abbot then said that "blue crop" 
is 
so much better than any other variety that it 
is the predominant 
variety that most people are raising now. 
If anything happens to 
the crop, so 
it happens to the industry, Abbot said. 
I asked if 
it was a heavier berry matter. 
Stephen said no, 
it 
is a better 
shipper, better taster, better producer, all 
the way around. 
Abbot said it's (garbled). 
(255) 
We came out of the blueberry fields and crossed 563 to 
the packing houses. 
Stephen said this is the, back where you saw 
where the . . . the old garage, up at the house, they moved that 
down here. 
The barracks was the packing house at one time and 
stood here, 
in front of this, and that Quonset but there was 
attached onto the kitchen of this place, this 
is the labor camp 
here, and they moved them all 
down and then they built this (the 
new buildings). 
This (the site of the new buildings) 
is all 
filled—in ground. 
There were blueberries growing there at one 
time. 
They filled it in to give them a little more space; and 
this was like a little island of sand here. 
(How's that for a 
useless piece of text without a map? 
Photos just won't do here. 
Past and present mixed into the description with a healthy number 
of pronouns without antecedent in 
the bargain.) 
Abbot unlocked the packing house, and turned off the alarm 
system so we could go into the various buildings. 
First we went 
into the barracks where the Puerto Rican labor force lived. 
There was a pile of jackets, gloves and boots 
in the front hall. 
Stephen said they furnished them those items. 
Abbot said they 
(the workers) were here for 6 or 7 weeks of cold season and.... 
Abbot said they like the individuality of having their own room, 
or at the most to have to share it with one other person. 
(There 
was a long central hall with rooms on either side. 
Most of the 
rooms had at least one bunk, sometimes two; but most rooms 
looked, by the sheets, as 
if they had only one occupant.) 
Abbot 
said, which I think you can appreciate having been through 
school. At the end of the hall was a large room (maybe 16 by 30) 
O'Connor--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 40 
that served, Abbot said as the kitchen and "hallish"?? (unclear) 
room, or whatever. 
Stephen said they left the place in exceptionally good 
condition. 
It's spotless when they come in, 
and they (the Lee's) 
expect it to be spotless when they go out. 
Abbot said they have 
had to come in there sometimes with like a steam jenny and do the 
walls, the floor, the whole day. 
But Abbot said this 
is exactly 
the way they left it, and that's good. 
I asked how many people 
lived 
in here. 
Abbot said a maximum of 
12, usually 8 to 12. 
There could be up to 2 people to a room. 
Abbot said 
in some 
cases there is one to a room. 
This year is the first time, Stephen said, they used 
stainless steel trays instead of dishes. 
He said dishes end up 
in the garbage. 
Abbot said they break, you know. 
They're (the 
stainless steel trays that look like large TV dinner design 
trays) easier to dry. 
Stephen pointed out the showers to me. 
(Come to think of 
it, 
it reminded me of the Nottingham Gun Club's showers and 
bathroom, a large shower stall with a few shower heads and a 
couple of sinks and toilets.) 
I asked how long the workers were 
there (each year). 
Stephen said they came just after Labor Day 
and left last Saturday. 
Abbot said it's just about two months. 
I asked how many hours per day they work. 
Abbot said and 
then Stephen said they are guaranteed 8 hours, and Stephen said, 
even 
if 
it rains. 
They are guaranteed 40 hours per week. 
Abbot 
said they're here, and there 
is not a lot to do here other than 
work. 
they don't have to work more than 6 days a week, but they 
can. 
And they do, usually, when they need them for picking; 
because it's hard to start and stop picking cranberries because 
of the sequence of events. 
Abbot guessed the biggest weeks they 
had were 75 hour weeks. 
A man works here and goes home and 
is 
on 
unemployment all winter. 
and he might as well relax then. 
Which 
is kind of the nature of agriculture. 
(340) 
Next we went into the building where the sorting of 
cranberries takes place. 
Abbot asked 
if I had seen the bouncing 
machines (discussed in AM0004) before. 
I said no. 
Abbot showed 
me the machines that separate the rotten berries from the good 
berries. 
The berries come in from a hopper at the top, and then 
they're thrown against these plates. 
They bounce and go up 
if 
they are good; 
if they bounce on the third, fourth, or sixth try, 
they could either be a second and 
if they don't bounce at all 
then they are rotten. 
The rotten ones are thrown away and the 
seconds go back into the dryer for another try. 
Abbot said the 
machines themselves were bought, but the rest of 
it 
is made (the 
conveyor belts and connections between machines to make the 
combination of machines work together.) 
The Hayden Separator was 
bought. 
O'Connor--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 41 
Stephen then paced me through the steps, the route, a 
cranberry takes through the maze of conveyors. 
It was too dark 
to photograph without lights, and this might be an 
interesting 
process to photograph, especially in action. 
The cranberries end 
up 
in a large box that is weighed on a scale. 
When the box gets 
up to 950 lbs. 
it automatically stops the belt from feeding 
berries into the box. 
The Lees designed the entire operation and 
bought the separator and the scale to suit their needs. 
It 
is 
really an interesting series of machines, dryers, coolers, 
heaters, conveyor belts, etc.

TXOI: 
This 
is a continuation of PFP83—AM0005. G—Chatsworth; 27GT 
(001) 
Stephen showed me where Stephen stands with the cash 
register that also keeps production records (discussed in 
AM0004). 
He stands next to the scale at the register. 
Before 
they had that machine Stephen said, 
if you bought ten lbs. 
of 
berries and it was ten and 1/2 lbs. and they would say all 
right. 
They always knew it the way 
it was, Abbot said, but not having a 
mechanical. 
But Stephen interrupted to say, people don't 
appreciate it (getting more 
poundage) because they always feel 
as 
though they've been taken. 
It's a funny deal. 
Abbot said that 
when you buy meat you pay to the hundredth of a lb. 
They used to 
always round back to the 1/4 of a lb. 
But now they get paid 
right to the 100th of a lb. 
Next Stephen pointed out a machine I did not see a picture 
of, that was bought, Abbot said. 
Stephen said it was used to cut 
the brush up (the results of which I had seen 
in the blueberry 
rows across the street (PFP83—AM0005). 
Abbot said it's just like 
ca lawn mower but it's kind of heavy. 
It's for chopping up 
prunings. 
Abbot said it can chop up trees too. 
Anything a 
tractor would push over that would chop up, Stephen said. 
Abbot 
said the rows between blueberry bushes are either 8 or 10 feet 
O'Connor--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 43 
wide, and they use machinery that is either 5 or 6 feet wide. 
Next they pointed out the rototiller used to rotivate the 
soil. 
We walked out the back of the building housing that 
machinery onto a loading platform. 
Abbot pointed out cement 
pipes used 
in gates that were standing in the yard. 
(See PFP83— 
CM0009) 
He said they use these (cement) because they are cheaper 
to make and they can build them a lot faster. 
They buy the pipe. 
The boards extend up above the pipe to control the height of the 
water allowed in and out of the bog. 
I asked 
if the gate 
in the 
yard was the entire height of a finished gate. 
Abbot said yes, 
that when the bog was flooded the water would be about two feet 
from the top of the gate. 
Abbot said the deeper this is (the 
pipe) the faster the water is going to go through, the more 
pressure you have on 
it. 
I asked how the boards would be 
attached to the uprights. 
Abbot said they would be on the back 
permanently and they would lay them on 
in the front and the water 
pressure would hold them on. 
If the entire gate were made of 
wood (no cement pipe) Abbot said it would be important that the 
entire pipe area be under water all 
the time. 
Cement however 
doesn't rot, erosion 
is the only problem with cement. 
A worker showed up because he saw cars parked in the 
driveway and wanted to make sure everything was all 
right. 
They 
chatted while I took pictures of the gate. 
(080) 
Next we walked around the side of the building to the 
propagating beds (See PFP83—CM0009). 
On the way to those beds we 
passed by the area where the people who work just by the day are 
paid. 
(no pictures of this--my mistake). 
These people come on 
buses from Philadelphia. 
there was a little building on a slab 
foundation and the building could be moved indoors during the 
winter. 
There was an area for them to change and wash up and 
there were also portable toilets. 
I asked if they had Puerto 
Ricans coming from Philadelphia, too. 
Abbot said no, whatever 
comes on the bus, 
it doesn't matter, whatever. 
Stephen said, 
didn't they explain to me about the Cambodians (See PFP83— 
RMO022?) 
We arrived at the beds. 
Abbot said they were raising 
cranberry cuttings. 
He said they will cut them into 4 inch 
pieces and plant them and they will grow into masses again. 
He 
also pointed out blueberry cuttings. 
They are one year old, and 
he said, they don't grow much 
in the first year. 
I took some 
pictures. 
While I took pictures Abbot discussed the possibility of 
buying a plastic greenhouse with Stephen. 
the heater was the 
most expensive item, but still not too expensive, Abbot said. 
They discussed how to get necessary cuttings. 
Abbot said there 
is 
no sense, however, doing something in the winter you could do 
naturally in the summer, but if they could get more vines and 
plant them in the greenhouse and raise them, then they would have 
O'Connor--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 44 
that much more to plant in June. 
Stephen said but you won't be 
planting till next fall. 
But Abbot said he meant plant into a 
propagating bed to re—raise. 
Stephen said what you've got to 
figure on 
is next fall, how many plants you're going to have. 
(125) 
Next we passed by the paying house again, and Stephen 
said they pick 
it up with a forklift and bring it inside for the 
winter. 
(A muffled section.) 
Abbot said that their payroll 
is 
so out of proportion with the rest of the business that it 
is 
hard to computerize. 
I asked how come. 
Abbot said they might 
hire over a thousand different people a year. 
But as far as 
accounts receivable they only sell blueberries really to two 
people, the rest of 
it 
is cash. 
It's not like you sell 
to a 
hundred different people and have different accounts. 
It 
requires a big machine, but just to do payroll. 
and do payroll 
for maybe 30 days. 
Next we came to the blueberry picker inside the new 
building. 
It has a spring that connects (?) to the vibrators and 
they'll shake and they'll turn either clockwise or counter 
clockwise; and you can control the vibration. 
In other words, 
Stephen said, 
if you got a hold of this when it was picking the 
vibrator shakes them (blueberries) off onto the conveyor belt 
back to a blower and finally end up 
in one of those yellow boxes. 
There's two little trailers that follow each row. 
I asked 
if 
they lost many berries that way, and Stephen said no, and Abbot 
said 8%, but a picker might drop 5% on an average. 
(155) 
Next Abbot pointed out the pruning machine. 
they also 
call 
it the rake. 
I saw the knife blades. 
Next Abbot showed me the picking boxes used 
in the field. 
They are all plastic now, Abbot said. 
They nest, and you can 
take out ten or twelve of those and easily carry them away. 
Stephen said they used to be all made out of wood, and pointed 
out some laying up at the top. 
He said you can imagine a pile of 
those you had, they didn't nest. 
You can only pick up three or 
four of them at a time. 
And, Abbot said, they would slide on top 
of one another. 
these, he said, all 
interlock even when they're 
full 
of berries. 
Plastic in field containers have done a lot for 
them, Abbot said. 
Next Abbot showed me the wagon used to transport people for 
the pick—your—own business. 
He said they use wagons like this 
anyway. 
they just took a wagon he said, and put seats on 
it. 
They didn't want people to fall off so that's the reasoning for 
the fence. 
Stephen said this 
is the height of this so you can 
tell them to put the box (of berries) here ( on the floor) and 
they can get off the wagon and they don't have to carry 
it down 
the steps. 
It slides under here (space between the floor of the 
wagon and the bottom of the fence). 
(Muffled section here.) 
(187) 
Next we came to a pump that Stephen said was 
in the 
O'Connor--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 45 
house way down that we passed when driving around. 
That's going 
to be replaced by a bigger pump. 
He showed me where the pope 
comes up from the dam and into the pump at an angle (again no 
pictures of this machinery because I did not bring lights). 
This 
machine runs on diesel they both said after I asked. 
It used 
four gallons an hour, Abbot said. 
I asked how much it costs to 
buy one of these, and Abbot said over $10,000. 
That's through 
Speedwell Equipment again, Abbot said. 
they do use Speedwell 
Equipment to buy engines because it saves about 22% on an engine. 
Stephen pointed out the rollers that attach to the engine. 
When 
the pump was being used, he said, the rollers came up and them 
there were two places in the floor where you can pull 
the pump 
right down to the base so there is no vibration. 
The exhaust comes out and runs a turbine which runs another 
turbine which sucks the air in faster. 
It's called supercharged 
and this motor would normally be a maximum of 120 horse power; 
and you put this little gadget here on and all of a sudden it 
becomes 150 horse power. 
And it's much more efficient and 
economical. 
They like these John Deere engines, Abbot said. 
they are kind of prejudiced, a lot of people go with the Doit 
(sp?) which is a popular air—cooled diesel. 
And they're supposed 
to be very efficient because they run very hot. 
Everything John 
Deere makes is water cooled, Abbot said. 
(225) 
Next Abbot pointed out the cranberry harvester. 
I said 
this 
is the one he made and he said yea. 
I said that it 
is very 
impressive. 
Abbot said it could be a lot different. 
He showed 
me the wheels that knock the berries off the vine. 
They spin 
around about a hundred times a minute, he said. 
And there's five 
of these bars; so 
it means that if 
it stood still 
an upright 
would be hit 500 times a minute, but it 
is not standing still, 
it's moving almost two miles an hour. 
Although they don't go 
that fast anymore, he said. 
The coils on the wheels are a 
hydraulic cooler. 
That's one of the problems with it, Abbot 
said. 
The compatibility in pressure; 
it gets really hot. 
They 
made an attachment this year to pick the edges of the ditches. 
They put that on after they're all done, Abbot said. 
It works; 
the reason that is 
so much different from this (the other roller 
wheels) 
is because in the ditch there 
is so much grass that if 
you put one of these (regular wheels--this one is a barrel and 
not open with 5 bars) in the ditch 
it would get so clogged up 
with grass that it wouldn't work, cause it would be big gobs 
instead of these picking bars (?). 
With that there's no place 
for grass to wrap around. 
And that wheel would go down 
in 
the 
ditch. 
It floated which 
is 
all 
right, you just let it fill 
up 
with water through the cracks. 
But then they found if 
you spun 
it too fast, centrifugal force would throw the water out and 
it 
would float again. 
It worked fairly well, even with all these 
little problems, Abbot said. 
We then went over to another part of the building which 
housed a couple of snowmobiles on a trailer. 
I asked when they 
O'Connor--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 46 
got to use those things. 
Abbot said he had been going up to the 
Poconos. 
There's a nice park there, he said, Hickory Run, did I 
know where that is. 
Vaguely, I said. 
Abbot said they used to go 
to Maine a lot. 
One of the snowmobiles is 
12 years old, and the 
other was purchased about 2-3 years ago, he said. 
(265) 
Stephen said, to give me an 
idea how things have 
changed with inflation during the last few years, they started 
out with a used one of these (backhoes) and paid, he thought, 
about $1500 for it. 
Then the first new one, they had a couple of 
those, the used ones, they bought one for $15,000. 
That was 
in 
1972, he thought. 
They got the one we were looking at about 
three years ago, and this was $42,000. 
Now, he was talking about 
the same thing. 
Well, this one has more weight on 
it and has an 
extended hoe, you can extend the boom out and things like that; 
but . . . .it's the same thing. 
Abbot said let's say the tractor 
was bought in 
'72 for $15,000, they sold that for $1500 with how 
many hours, 3000 hours, 
a lot of time on it. 
It needed a lot of 
work; that's why they sold it obviously, Abbot said, not because 
they wanted a new paint job or something. 
And the point of 
it 
is 
that to start today or something is 
. 
Stephen said they bought a tractor for $1800 with a front 
end loader on 
it 
in 
'60 and sold it for $2300 without the front 
end loader on 
it. 
And sold the front end loader and got more 
money for that. 
that's what inflation, Abbot said, has done for 
machinery. 
Abbot thinks that (inflation) has probably slowed 
down a lot. 
(290) 
I asked if they had this building built or did they do 
it themselves. 
Abbot said they had 
it built. 
Abbot said they 
cut the wood for the panelling right here on the property. 
Stephen began to say that this land was once a reservoir, and 
Abbot continued (after apologizing for interrupting) that it was 
once a reservoir and they decided they needed the 
land and filled 
it 
in. 
This pine, he said, protects that metal. 
They took 
it to 
a mill to be rough cut (Lucas I think). 
Abbot said people say 
gee this is beautiful panelling, I'd like to have this 
in my den. 
It was just the cheapest, 
it was cheaper than plywood. 
They like 
it, Abbot said. 
Abbot said they cleaned this building out last 
Sept. and had a Lee family picnic. 
A lot of people. 
The 
borrowed tables from the fire company. 
Stephen said this 
is a big building. 
The hardware in this 
building, Abbot said, was $14,000 not counting any labor. 
You 
can 
imagine what the bricks would cost, he said, at a dollar 
apiece now for brick. 
I asked what the dimensions of the 
building were. 
Stephen said 20x100 feet. 
If you were building a 
hall, he said, this could seat 400 people for dinner. 
Stephen said he 
learned a lot last night. 
(He was at a 
meeting.) 
He said you would think a church a circular pew would 
put more people 
in 
it, 
if you had a fan shaped (pew), but it 
O'Connor--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 47 
would put less (than straight). 
It's more expensive (the fan 
shape) and would fit less people. 
Next they opened the garage door and showed me their 
flagpole, that they cut right there on their property. 
I asked 
how often they use 
it. 
They said every day 
in the summer. 
It 
was a synthetic flag, Abbot said. 
Next they closed the garage door facing the road, and we 
walked back through the rest of the building on our way out the 
front door. 
We passed a car that belongs to a friend of the 
Lees. 
She 
is 
in the Navy. 
(Muffled section here.) 
(370) 
I remarked on how quiet it was outside. 
Abbot said 
it's not this quiet during the summertime, not because of them 
but because of the traffic. 
Although, he said it could be a lot 
worse. 
there are places where you can't even get from one side 
(of the road) to the other. 
(Lots of background noise here, 
closing of garage doors, and noises I don't remember hearing when 
I was there.) 
(One of the noises that came up a lot during the interview 
and tour was planes flying overhead every few minutes. 
It's 
amazing how much I was able to block that sound out while I was 
there--and at headquarters. 
It always surprises me how we can 
hear what we want to hear, and filter so many sounds out.) 
(420) 
For the last 30 or 40 feet of tape most of the time was 
spent closing and locking up the packing houses. 
Stephen pointed 
out to me that the wrought iron railing leading up the steps into 
the packing house was homemade, by Abbot. 
He twisted some of the 
rods 
in the railing (spindles), by attaching the rod to a vise at 
one end and gripping the other end with a wrench and just 
twisting. 
Then Stephen pointed out the location of their well, right 
next to the door leading into the packing house. 
END OF SIDE ONE 
SIDE TWO 
(001) 
We began taping again after we got back to the Lee's 
houses on Speedwell Road. 
(This was accidental. 
I thought the 
tape was rolling all 
the time, but it wasn't. 
I guess I should 
have held the recorder and the mike while riding 
in the car and 
given 
it to Abbot only when we were walking around.) 
Stephen 
talked about one of the houses on the Lee property that was a 
foreman's house. 
He said they've spent $15,000 or better on 
it, 
just in fixing it up. 
Stephen and Abbot both said that it would 
have been easier to push it down and start over again, but they 
have insulated it and put in air conditioning, new bathrooms, 
it's all 
rewired, the whole works, Stephen said. 
(They had sold 
O'Connor--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 48 
the property at one time.) 
And, he said, they bought it all 
back 
again, and he paid through the nose to get it back. 
They had to 
have 
it, 
he said, because there was a fella who was interested in 
it, 
and 
it was his (that person's) cousin who they were afraid 
would build a lot of 
little, cheap houses here; and they didn't 
want it. 
And the other house 
in the area (within one hundred yards) 
they have first option on. 
(See see associated clogs and blogs.) 
Abbot said they were a greedy as anybody else when it comes to 
land, the only thing 
is they feel 
like they have to pay for it. 
They didn't ask the state to buy 
it. 
Abbot said, really that 
gets right down to the basis of the thing. 
They didn't want a 
lot of neighbors either, and maybe that's . . . and we 
acknowledge the fact, and they, Dad bought it, Abbot said. 
He 
(Stephen) didn't ask for the township to zone 
it so nothing could 
ever be built there, he went out and bought it, Abbot said. 
They 
didn't have any money then to buy 
it, 
but he bought it. 
It's 
exactly the same as the preservation thing. 
And they pay taxes 
on 
it for the privilege of owning 
it, Abbot said. 
(015) 
Stephen discussed a topic that he 
later asked me to 
edit out, so I did. 
(022) 
Stephen talked about how transportation has changed. 
You had the old roads and people came, they had a different 
reason. 
(Talking about vacationers here.) 
We sat down at the 
dining room table where I had begun the interview with Abbot a 
few hours earlier. 
Stephen began to show me some old pictures he 
had of how the property used to look a generation or so ago. 
I 
began to take photos of the photos. 
(040) 
Stephen showed me a picture of the original house on 
the property, and an old barn that had been converted to a camp. 
Stephen asked 
if we had done anything for the project on 
Harrisville, the paper mill. 
He showed me a piece of pig iron, 
pure iron. 
He then showed me a photograph of the BR stone on the 
property that is used on all 
the surveys of Speedwell; Benjamin 
Randolph (BR) was the first owner of the land 
in 1785. 
The pig 
iron, Stephen said, and they still 
do the same thing, 
is run out 
into a sand mold. 
This pig iron was transported down the stream 
in ore boats. 
He then mentioned Batsto and the ore boat that's 
laying in there. 
They had ore boats, he said, that transported 
this (iron) down the Wading River and then it was taken up the 
Mullica to Batsto where they had the forges there. 
They made 
canons, the guns, the stoves, and all 
the various things. 
That 
pig 
in the picture is 
in the Camden Historical Society now. 
I 
asked what a pig weighed. 
Stephen said 75-100 lbs. 
But the one 
he has, he said, you can still see the Speedwell (insignia), but 
it was ruptured. 
In other words the mold broke in there, and it 
was red hot, you know as 
it slurred out there, so they discarded 
it. 
they had to be all 
uniform. 
But it was still the same iron. 
O'Connor--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 49 
(070) 
Next another picture of the front of the house where 
Stephen was born. 
Next was a picture of an old house that was on 
the property. 
That was taken down. 
They had some beautiful 
shots of 
it, 
he said, but he must of loaned them to someone. 
that was a beautiful house, he said, even the third floor was all 
lath and plaster. 
Next he showed me a picture of the James Lee family, with 
his grandmother (Stephen's), his father, and his father's four 
brothers and two sisters. 
This is the same Lee that had the 
camp, Stephen said. 
Next he showed me a picture of the swimming hole that is now 
blueberry fields (See PFP83—AM0005). 
It was really nice, Stephen 
said, they have pictures of kids swimming in there when they were 
little. 
But that filled up with bottles and cans. . . . 
Next was a picture of a house I had seen before (which one?) 
Stephen said 
it had stood idle from '33 until 
'43. 
Well you can 
imagine what happened, he said, this had fireplaces that were 
closed up. 
Well, they dug them out, and the house--well 
everybody thinks there's treasures in the old places, and 
in the 
cellar walls were all undermined (?). 
So when he got here, 
Stephen said, the thing stood there, 
like the whole second floor 
was hanging out ready to come down. 
So he got a lot of criticism 
from historical people and all for not rebuilding it (this 
is not 
the house he grew up 
in but the older one of weathered 
clapboard). 
Well, he said, he did not have enough money to 
rebuild his own house. 
A lot of people can tell you what you 
should do, but you can imagine. . . . He'd love to have seen it 
rebuilt, he said. 
I asked who lived there when 
it was lived 
in, 
and Stephen said that was the old Randolph house. Course that was 
added on (to), and he pointed out the main part of the house. 
He 
said he had a letter from somebody right outside of Washington 
that really laid him low for tearing, destroying this . . . . 
(110) 
Next Stephen showed me a picture of a boat they used to 
use to raise up the cranberries. 
It had an airplane motor on it. 
After you scooped the bog by hand you put that boat on and 
it 
brought the berries up. 
You'd scoop them dry, then you would 
flood it, then go through and raise the berries up and gather the 
floaters. 
I said that was a lot of work . . . and Stephen said 
it was a big difference than it 
is today. 
(120-145) (I took pictures of the pictures.) 
(145) 
(I 
remarked that the old Randolph house was a hell 
of a 
building. 
Stephen agreed, and said it was a shame that it had to 
go, but what happened was as the years of the public working on 
it for well fourteen years almost, 
it was really in sad shape. 
I returned to taking pictures. 
I took all 
the shots in 
O'Connor--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 50 
black and white, and they were of black and white shots. 
I 
didn't have enough light for color without a tripod. 
I'm 
learning what I need to bring 
if I want to get pictures. 
I 
realized I had to be satisfied with the 35mm lens. 
I never even 
thought about taking the pictures outside, did I.) 
(165) 
I asked who was 
in the picture with Governor Pinchot. 
Stephen said there was general Scott the time he was head 
of Ft. Dix around World War I, 
Stephen's father, himself, a man 
from the Inquirer, the game warden. 
This was a picture taken on 
a hunting expedition. 
Others 
in 
it were a Darlington, John 
Collins from Mt. Holly, George Rendell from Mt. Holly and 
in 
business with Collins, and Morton. 
the picture was taken in 
1918. 
The list of people 
in the picture was on the back of 
it. 
Stephen III, Stephen II's son and Abbot's brother, walked 
in 
at this time. 
Stephen II said that was an 
interesting meeting 
last night to his son, and Stephen III asked what he thought of 
him (the architect?). 
His father said he liked him. 
He thought 
after another couple of meetings they should give him the reins 
and let him go. 
(190-210) Picture taking and little or no conversation. 
(270) 
Another shot of Stephen III at the new cash register. 
I asked if they had an office here 
in the basement after they 
said that was where the register was. 
Stephen III said sort of, 
a small one. 
I asked if I could get a picture of the framed poem that 
Stephen II 
had shown me the week before. 
It was written for his 
father. 
(I got it.) 
(310) 
Stephen II 
said he was very proud of that poem. 
He 
said, not in the way of bragging, but that the type of people 
they had (working) were altogether different. 
(Muffled section 
here--we moved away from the recorder into the living room.) 
He 
said they had nice people today, he was not saying that . . . . 
He talked about the different kinds of people who used to come 
down to canoe here and explore, and said 
it 
is sad the way things 
have changed for the worse in terms of the way the visitors treat 
the I 
and . 
Stephen said that when he and his wife moved here they could 
put their canoe 
in 
up at the bridge he had showed me (between 
their house and the bogs) and paddle for a couple of miles down 
the river and walk back up to their car. 
The would have a little 
portable radio. 
And you wouldn't see anybody, or . . . . I said 
I heard that now it's like rush hour around here. 
Stephen said, 
oh boy, yea. 
(345) 
Stephen said, but that's times the way 
it 
is all 
over, 
he guessed. 
Actually, I said, that was one of the nice things 
O'Connor--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 51 
about Maine, 
it's still fairly uncluttered. 
Stephen said his son 
Stephen (III) 
is 
leaving Wed. for Maine. 
For Thanksgiving. 
They 
went up for years, Stephen II said. 
The family would get 
together and . . . . So he's going up. 
(360) 
Stephen II asked me (Stephen III had disappeared about 
100 feet of tape ago) 
if I had ever been west. 
I said a little 
bit. 
He asked me 
if I had ever been to Santa Fe. 
I said no. 
He 
said here was an interesting thing, and showed me a brochure that 
pictured a church with a black iron spiral staircase running from 
the main floor up to the balcony or choir loft. 
Stephen said 
that last night he had this architect there and the building 
committee, so he said any mistakes that the architect made he 
could just turn it over to the pastor; and he gave the pastor 
this article to read. 
He said he would give me the story there 
real quick. 
It was that, 
it's only about in 1852, or something like 
that, this group of nuns came up out of Kentucky, and they came 
up 
into the Santa Fe area, and they built this church. 
When they 
built the church, when they built the choir loft, 
it was quite 
high; and 
it gives the price and all 
of the thing, what it cost 
and all. 
But they didn't allow, they made a mistake and didn't 
allow any way to get to the choir loft. 
You see there was no way 
to get to 
it, 
unless you went from the outside which they didn't 
want to do. 
So the story goes that said well, something will 
happen, that they had a novena which they were; and anyway, a man 
came along (muffled) with a  
 amount of tools and asked them 
if 
he could help them out, and he built the stairway. 
And today 
it's an engineering marvel that it's a spiral, 360 degrees, and 
the, ah, there's no nails in 
it. 
The wood 
is not anything native 
to that area. 
they don't know where it came from. 
And he 
left 
without being paid, and (muffled) were the batteries failing 
here?). 
So the thing of 
it 
is that, 
in other words, 
it was, see 
that, 
it was St. Joseph that came and did the job. 
I said it's a 
miracle. 
And Stephen said, 
it's a miracle. 
Stephen said today engineers don't know what it 
is, and when 
you walk on it you come down, there's sort of a springy feeling 
to 
it. 
There's a,  
 , today they've stopped,  
 , they've 
stopped people from using 
it because you can imagine up 
'n down, 
up 
'n down, up 
'n down, that they would expect it to, 
it's a 
beautiful church. 
(400) 
I asked Stephen 
if 
he had been there. 
He said yes, 
some of the oldest churches in the U.S. are out there, right in 
Santa Fe. 
We think that we have the oldest, but they worked up 
from the  
(my fault, I interrupted and said the Spanish 
Missions) and Stephen said yea, the Spanish Missions. 
So, he 
said, he had a lot of fun with it 
last night. 
He just happened 
to find it yesterday, he said. 
I said it was amazing how many stories there are about stuff 
O'Connor--83 Audiocassette logs

like that, that I am always impressed and surprised.

TECH: 
TX01 : 
MO: 
It's the 20th of June, and I'm talking to Eddie Lamonaca at 
his farm on Pine Road in G—Hammonton; 11GT. All 
right. 
MO: Now the first question I want to 
cover with you 
is about the history of the farm itself. I 
know you said it was a stagecoach stop at one time? 
EL: 
Uh huh, that's right. 
MO: 
How long ago was that? 
EL: Way back before when Whitehurst 
Pike was just a dirt road; there was a road that went from 
Glassboro to Atsion, Atsion, which 
is out Route 206. There 
was a stagecoach trail, and the coach used to ride from 
Glassboro to Atsion every other day, and this house was a 
stopping point -- 
it was a hotel. 
And 
in front of the house was a general store. 
The stagecoach would stop here, people would get out and 
go 
inside the general store, buy what they had to buy. 
If people wanted to stay over, they would stay over in the 
hotel. 
MO: Uh huh. 
EL: This went on probably for a 
few years, and eventually the Whitehurst Pike was widened 
and was tarred, and by that time cars came into use on a 
regular basis. 
MO: 
So this was, 
like, the turn of the century? 
Now did your family own 
it at that time? 
EL: Okay. My grandfather, when he 
came from Italy, he purchased the farm down the street; he 
didn't have enough money to buy this place on the corner. 
So they bought, I think the original farm they bought was 
20 acres, and I think that was 
in grapes. I think that's what 
they were into at that time -- vineyards. 
MO: Uh huh. 
EL: 
Coming from Italy, he was originally 
a great farmer. After they saved up enough money, they 
expanded their farm and they bought this half of the farm 
O'Connor--85 Audiocassette logs 
page 54 
from Pine Road all 
the way up to Union Road here, up to the 
corner. 
But no, they didn't own the farm when it was 
a stagecoach stop, but they owned it after that; and 
I remember my father telling me that he and his brothers 
(of course they were young then, 
like 11 
or 12 years old) they 
took the bar that was in the front room, 
it was a redwood 
bar, a beautiful redwood bar that surrounded the whole 
room with a pot bellied stove 
in the back. 
MO: Yeah. 
EL: 
They took the redwood bar out and 
used it for a workbench outside of the shop. So they 
didn't know anything about antiques in those days 
you know -- an antique to them was probably a musket from 
the Revolutionary War. 
MO: 
Uh huh. 
EL: 
Then as time went on, 
like I 
said, Route 30 was widened, cars came into use, and they 
probably did away with the Glassboro—Atsion Road. 
MO: 
Route 30 was dirt then? 
EL: 
Route 30 was a dirt road, yeah. 
Just horse and wagon at that time. So this could have 
been a stagecoach stop even before the turn of the century 
going like, 
into the 1890's. 
I think the original house was built somewhere 
in the late 1880's, so 
it's close to 100 years old. 
MO: 
Oh, I see. 
EL: 
Yeah. 
MO: And, do you know a lot of people 
who moved over from Glassboro to Atsion? I mean, what was 
going on? Was there something going on 
in Atsion, 
like 
industry or something? 
EL: 
Yeah, that was the main thing 
a Bob Weir, okay? Atsion 
had a Bob Weir works just like 
Batsto did. And Glassboro was a glass 
refinery or glass refactory where they would, I don't know 
if they would make glass or they'd refracture glass somehow, 
but that was the main industry 
in the area between Glassboro 
and Atsion. 
MO: 
And that still was on that road too 
Or was that separate, would that be further 
EL: Batsto would be further east from 
MO: 
Okay, just so I know which is which 
EL: Right, okay. 
MO: So your father's father came from Italy, right? 
EL: 
Yes. 
MO: 
And where was he 
in Italy? 
EL: Let's see, what's the name of 
it? 
I'm pretty sure the District is Brutsie. 
MO: 
Cream cheese! 
EL: As far as the township I don't know -- but Brutsie is our 
O'Connor--85 Audiocassette logs 
page 55 
nationality. Our Italian nationality, Brutsie is. 
MO: There's a guy named Dabruno who has 
an Italian market in south Philly, and Brutsie is a cheese 
he makes. 
EL: 
Yeah, I know it. 
MO: 
It's fabulous. 
EL: 
I'm familiar with that, yeah. Good 
stuff . 
MO: 
And it's hot, too, 
it's not real 
mild. Anyway, so the last time I remember you were telling 
me that you had a barn out back directly out back of the 
house was a bakery? 
EL. 
Yes. 
MO: 
And 
it was for the hotel? 
EL: Yes, there was a baker that lived 
upstairs, and he baked his bread downstairs a 
in the general store. I don't know what type 
they had. You know, probably the person who o 
at that time, a Mr. Crezenzo, I think he was 
he probably had the baker working for him, ha 
and he had some kind of room for him upstairs 
MO: 
Uh huh. 
EL: 
And like I said, the downstairs 
part of 
it, there were two large ovens where he would have 
bread baked daily. 
MO: 
Did 
it take up 
EL: Oh, yeah, they w 
MO:

wned the house 
the owner, and 
d him employed; 
in the barn. 
arage. 
ge, as a matter of fact. Yeah. 
ns still there 
ed. There are a few antiques 
e's anything pertaining to the 
us 
is the summer kitchen; that was 
e time, and what happened was when we 
s part of the house 
is newer than the 
m? 
kitchen was added on. That 
y was attached to original house, and 
MO: 
That was the kitchen? 
EL: That was the kitchen, yeah. So when we built this kitchen, 
we moved that across the yard. And we still used it. There were 
a lot of women here at the time; there was my father, my mother, 
my brother, two sisters, my uncle and my aunt, and their three 
children, my other uncle, my grandfather and my grandmother. 
MO: 
Whew! 
EL: Yeah. The whole family was here, I mean, this 
is a 15 room 
house, a lot of rooms. So the purpose of that building at that 
time was to be used 
in cooking and 
in preparing food 
in 
the 
summer time. There was no electricity as we know it today. The 
only electric we had was man made electric; they would have 
bottles downstairs in rows, and they would have wires going from 
O'Connor--85 Audiocassette logs 
page 56 
one bottle to the next. And then at the end of the wires, they 
would be connected to a circular type of generator, by hand. And 
you'd go down there and turn this generator, and the bottles 
would act as a battery, and 
it would store the electricity from 
this hand generator. 
MO: 
Yeah. 
EL: So there was no electric as we know it today, no 110 or 220. 
MO: Do you remember this? 
EL: No. 
MO: 
Is this your father when he was a kid 
EL: Yes. 
MO: Okay. 
EL: So basically, that building up there was used to cook, 
because they used a wood stove. 
MO: Uh huh. 
EL: And 
it would get pretty hot up there, so they had to keep it 
separate from the house. And they would carry the food in here, 
and serve it for lunch or dinner or whatever. 
So that was the 
summer kitchen, that's how it got its name. The summer kitchen. 
MO: Yes. 
EL: Now I still have some antiques from there -- I have the wood 
stove, that's still 
intact. 
MO: No kidding. 
EL: And I have an old hutch that I'm thinking about restoring --
I've managed to save 
it from termites, and there was an old dry 
sink 
in there, and there was a wet sink and an old pump where 
we'd pump all 
that stuff. But I just don't have the time to do 
what I'd 
like to do with 
it, 
you know, to restore it and to maybe 
have one building set aside here. 
MO: Uh huh. 
EL: I know at one time we were approached by the Historical 
Society -- they wanted to refurbish the house. 
MO: 
Anything special? 
EL: To do the whole thing. 
MO: 
Oh, the whole thing? 
EL: Yeah, they were willing to come 
in and set aside a certain 
amount of money to completely redo the house the way 
it was 
originally. 
MO: 
They'd take this all out? 
EL: No, 
I'm saying the existing house, the way it 
is now. 
MO: Oh, oh, I see. 
EL: They wanted to redo the outside 
in the original clapboard, 
the German siding clapboard, and they wanted to paint it and they 
wanted to put all 
the artwork back on the porch, with all 
of the 
scrolls under the columns and everything, the way 
it originally 
was. 
In fact, we had pictures here. 
MO: 
Oh, fabulous. 
EL: We have one picture here that was on the front of the 
Saturday Evening Post, a picture of my grandfather sitting 
outside in front of the house with his horse and wagon, with his 
produce on the back. My father, who was about 11 
years old at the 
time, and his two brothers standing on the side. One was older 
and one was younger. 
And then a picture of the packing house in 
O'Connor--85 Audiocassette logs 
page 57 
the foreground with Lamonaca fruit and produce on the top of the 
roof . 
MO: 
Uh huh. 
EL: And that was used on the front of the Saturday Evening Post. 
MO: 
Was there an article, also with it? 
EL: Yeah, about Carmen Lamonaca, he was my grandfather. 
MO: 
Do you have the article still? 
EL: 
It's here somewhere, I don't know, I have to dig 
it up. 
MO: 
I'm sure you can get a hold of 
it 
EL: Well, I'd 
like to find the picture. 
That's in the office 
somewhere: either in the safe or somewhere 
in the record. 
MO: 
Oh, that'd be great. 
EL: Yeah, I know. In fact, as a matter of fact, I want to get 
that and do some kind of a sketch on 
it and maybe use 
it for some 
kind of a logo or some kind of a label 
on the boxes for some kind 
of promotion. 
MO: 
That'd be really nice. 
EL: 
Yeah 
MO: So the whole house was originally clapboard before this 
asphalt shingle thing went on. 
EL: Yeah. 
MO: Do you know the date when this summer kitchen was moved off 
and this kitchen and dining room done? 
EL: My father would know those dates I could give you a rough 
date -- 
it would be within ten years, you know, but he could narrow 
it down to the year 
MO: Okay, I'll have to talk to him later and ask him. 
EL: Okay, right. 
MO: 
So when were you born? 
EL: 
In 1949. 
MO: 
In 
'49. 
EL: On the couch, 
in the other room! 
MO: Were you? That's great. Then at that time there were a lot of 
people living here. 
EL: Yes. 
MO: 
Like the whole family. 
EL: Quite a few. 
MO: 
That's great. 
EL: Including a dog and a cat. 
MO: 
Great as far as the other buildings go, the barn that was 
the bakery is still 
in the exact same building, right? 
EL: Yes. 
MO: 
Behind the house? 
EL: Yes, right. 
MO: And then the block building was originally a barn, eh? 
EL: 
It was originally a barn where we had horses, wagons, hay, 
just about everything you need to run a farm without the use of 
tractors -- everything was done by horse, and wooden plows and 
wooden tools 
MO: 
Uh huh. 
EL: And from what my father tells me, there was a fire, a severe 
fire, an 
intense fire one night, and I don't know how it started, 
but the next thing they knew they looked outside and everything 
O'Connor--85 Audiocassette logs 
page 58 
was flaming. Horses were crying out, and I don't know if they 
were saved or not. 
MO: But that was when your father was here, though. 
EL: Yes, yeah. 
MO: 
When they owned it. 
EL: Yes. 
MO: 
Did they build that barn? 
EL: That I don't know, I don't think so I think that was an 
existing barn when they bought the property. 
MO: And you replaced it with another building? 
EL: We replaced it with a cinderblock building, yes. 
MO: 
And this 
is the third structure you have had on this site, 
eh? 
EL: Yeah, that building was destroyed by a tornado, by a small 
tornado 
MO: Oh yeah, will you talk about the roof? 
EL: Yeah, okay. 
MO: That'd be great 
EL: Yeah, that was 
in March, I guess it was 
in the late 
seventies. My wife and I were upstairs and we heard the windows 
starting to rattle; we knew that there was a windstorm coming up, 
we had heard about it on th weather. And the next thing we heard 
was this gigantic boom; you know, we thought maybe 
it was a jet 
breaking the sound barrier or something, we didn't know -- and we 
go outs and here, we 
looked across the yard and we didn't see any 
shop, we didn't see any garage It was flattened, except that the 
roof was just sticking up. So we went out there, and sure enough, 
what happened was the wind had knocked down the garage door and a 
small tornado had gotten inside and picked the roof right up. The 
Land of Oz! You know, the next thing you know you went outside 
and there was nothing except tools scattered all 
over the yard 
and all 
kinds of brick and debris --and we had to have a 
construction company come 
in and put the thing back together 
again; put the roof 
in one piece, back up on pilings while the 
brick by brick ... 
MO: So the roof actually stayed intact, though. 
EL: The roof stayed intact, yes 
MO: 
That's amazing. 
EL: Oh yeah, and they replaced it brick by brick until they had 
the whole thing finished and then they set the roof back on top 
of 
it again. 
MO: And then the other two buildings you had a packing house and 
the ... cooling thing? 
EL: 
Well, the refrigeration and cooling system, that was I think 
built recently, that was 
in 
1980. But the packing house 
is the 
original packing house when my 
father bought it, when he came from 
Italy-- that was here 
Okay, so that's got to be turn of the 
century, 
that building was pretty old. 
MO: 
So this was used for peaches, right along with people? 
EL: 
Well, from the beginning I guess 
it was used for grapes, as 
a winery. 
MO: . Oh, okay. 
EL: 
Then when my grandfather had 
it, 
we had peaches, and then 
O'Connor--85 Audiocassette logs 
page 59 
from peaches we went to apples -- and now we're back into peaches 
again. 
MO: Uh huh. 
EL: 
We made the transition back to peaches. 
MO: Do you know what the cycle was 
in terms of years for that? 
EL: 
Well, a peach tree will survive basically 15 years. Okay, and 
apple tree can survive 30 years or longer, depending on how 
it's taken care of --
MO: I see. 
EL: 
The reason we went back into peaches is because apples are 
grown all 
over the country -- peaches aren't. Just like 
blueberries. They need a certain type of soil 
and a certain kind 
of elevation and a certain type of weather. 
South Jersey can 
grow peaches; that's why the 
majority of the farmers here that 
are 
in trees have 
gotten away from apples, because you're 
bucking apple 
country -- upstate New York, even Pennsylvania, 
they have 
far better apples than we do because they have better 
elevation 
MO: Uh huh. 
EL: 
They have a mountainous region. 
Out west, you have 
Washington state, northern California, 
Michigan -- all 
of those 
states are very heavily into apple production. 
MO: Yes. 
EL: 
So 
if you're picking apples here and they're not getting the 
proper color, they're not getting 
that ruby red delicious look, 
you know, they have more or 
less a pale look to them. And that's 
why it's so hard to 
market them as a number one apple, you know, 
for stored use. 
MO: Uh huh. 
EL: 
Basically the apples 
in New Jersey now, 
if there are any 
left, are used for processing. You know, Mrs. Smiths or Moms 
Apple Pies or whatever, they're used basically for apple cider, 
you know, for the squeezings. 
Then some are used for pies and 
what have you -- but there's really no great future in farming 
apples for market here 
in South Jersey. 
MO: 
: Is that because of the cooler temperature at night at 
higher elevations? 
EL: 
It's basically because there are better apples in other 
parts of the country -- and at one time, all 
the shipping was 
done by railroad car. And before that, horse and wagon. But now 
that tractor trailers have come into use and shipping is so much 
easier than it was before, as opposed to train cars, you know --
everything was packed into train cars before. Now everything is 
trucking companies, and 
it's so 
much easier to ship grapes from 
California and to buy grapes 
from California than it would be to 
try and raise them here. 
The same thing with apples; they're so 
much easier to buy Washington state mountain apples. 
MO: Uh huh. 
EL: 
Even though they're much more expensive than Jersey apples, 
the stores would rather sell a top quality Washington state apple 
before they'd sell a Pennsylvania apple or a New York state 
apple. 
MO: Uh huh. 
O'Connor--85 Audiocassette logs 
page 60 
EL: 
So basically, the apple business is dead here 
in South 
Jersey. All of the fruit tree farmers gone into peaches because 
of this. And from what 
have 
I see, there are a lot of orchards 
coming in, there are a lot of acres that have been planted. I 
have assumed that it's going to catch up one day, even though 
you're going to have bad years like we've had -- the past few 
years have not been good, from a combination of winter injury and 
spring 
frost. 
MO: Uh huh. 
EL: 
I know last year, we didn't have 
that many peaches to pick; 
this year we don't have that 
many, either. So it kind of 
balances itself out, even 
though there are a lot of trees going 
into the ground and a lot of acres being planted, Mother Nature 
still has a way 
of weeding out the amount of boxes as opposed to 
the amount 
of people. 
If there was a peach tree for every 
person in South Jersey, there would still be a considerable 
margin of profit to be made because the weather still takes a 
toll 
on the peach tree, they're very delicate. Not only the fruit 
is delicate, but the tree itself 
is very delicate. 
MO: 
Uh huh. And what about the competition in terms of other 
people growing peaches in other areas of the country? Are they 
better here? 
EL: 
Okay. It starts in Georgi 
the peach industry. When Georg 
even begun. 
We don't start ou 
has finished. It starts in Geo 
Carolinas, South Carolina, Nor 
the time it hits northern Virg 
time they're into production, 
dropped out now and the Caroli 
120 tons of peaches daily that 
in Jersey we have two or three 
may only have five or six tons 
as opposed to Georgia that has 
ones that set the price. Now i 
out by a spring frost or a win 
that's what has been happening 
the past few years. Their wint 
summers have been dry, so the 
good, and even their production has been 
lucky. 
But then our production has been 
k 
i 
nd of has a way of balancing i 
tse If out. 
to happen is that eventually I think a lot 
be 
indoors. I think it's coming to that. 
MO: 
It sounds like the hydroponic tomato plant. 
EL: 
Well, I don't know about hydroponic peaches, but I do 
think 
there are some tests now, there are some experiments going on 
about growing greenhouse peaches, 
like growing trees in the 
greenhouse. You wouldn't have to space the rows out so wide, you 
wouldn't have to leave so many feet between the trees, they could 
be condensed. 
But having control of the.atmosphere and having 
control of the weather conditions would guarantee you a crop 
every year and would guarantee you a profit. So I think this 
is 
a. Georgia is, 
like the capital of 
is 
is 
in production, we haven't 
r peach production until Georgia 
rgia and then it goes up to to 
th Carolina, on 
into Virginia. 
By 
inia, Maryland and Delaware by the 
we've just started. 
So Georgia has 
nas have dropped out. They may have 
they're pushing out, as where here 
at our max, at our peak point. We 
per day, that we're pushing out; 
like 120 or 150. 
So they're the 
f they're hurt, 
if they're wiped 
ter injury, the price goes up. 
And 
, this is what the trend has been 
ers have been cold and their 
qua I 
i 
ty of the i 
t fruit  has not been 
way off. So we have been 
way off, too. 
So 
it 
I think what's going 
of farms are going to 
O'Connor--85 Audiocassette logs 
page 61 
what farming 
is going to come to. 
It has already come to that 
with some crops, you know, with tomatoes and cucumbers and things 
like that; there are large companies down south and 
in the midwest 
that are experimenting with that now. I mean, acres and acres of 
greenhouses -- it's awesome. 
MO: 
You've seen it? 
EL: 
Well, 
in magazines, yeah, the Farmers Journal and what have 
you 
MO: 
Oh, I see. 
EL: 
But I think they're experimenting with that now, and it's a 
good idea, too, because if you are guaranteed a crop -- I mean, 
there 
is no guarantee that, the first thing you have to do 
is you 
have to buy the land, and 
okay -- you figure that farmland is 
about $2500 an acre. Th you have to buy the trees. Trees are $4 
apiece ,so you put 110 trees to an acre, so you're talking about 
$500. So you're up to $3,000 already. Then you have 
your labor 
involved in planting the trees, getting the ground ready, 
fumigating it, 
building up the PH 
if you have to. 
This 
is 
all 
time and money. Once the trees are 
in the ground, you have to 
maintain them, tree maintenance different sprays and what have you, 
different insecticides to use. And the sticker is that you have 
to wait three years for the trees to produce. 
Then on the third 
year you're only going to get a basket to a tree, 
if you're lucky 
-- you'll get a box. So 
if you figure $10 a box, or $5 a basket, 
on 100 trees you're only taking in $5-600 dollars over a period 
of three years. 
So really, 
it takes you six years before you get 
some of your money back. Okay? 
MO: Uh huh. 
EL: 
Your on 
have a ten ac 
that it's cos 
property and 
you know you' 
takes five or 
It's a long t 
MO: You know, 
telling me yo 
EL: 
Yeah, 
in 
MO: And then 
your profits 
EL: 
That's right, basically that's all you're doing, 
is you're 
trying to create something for your children. Like you're not 
going to get rich on a farm, even there are some blueberry 
farmers and some peach farmers in the area who do very well. 
You know, some large corporations I'm talking big farms, you 
know. 
MO: Are there some 
in this area? 
EL: 
There are some 
in this area that 
do, 
as far as sales do, 
they might do 
in the six digits or better. But they're very 
few. Okay. The average farm, 
if you pay your bills and you meet 
all 
of your obligations and you have a few thousand dollars at 
the end of the year to make 
it through the winter with, you've 
done well. 
ginal 
investment -- you figure $3,000, you might 
re block that you're putting in -- that's $30,000 
ting you. 
So you dump $30,000 into a piece of 
you wait three years and you only get $5,000 back, 
ve still got $25,000 to recover from. That's why it 
six years before you start getting your money back. 
erm, a long term investment. 
the last time we were talking, you were 
ur equity really 
is 
in the farm 
itself, right? 
the farm itself, right --
the fact that it takes a few generations to really get 
O'Connor--85 Audiocassette logs 
page 62 
MO: Uh huh. 
EL: 
What you're doing is you're trying create something for 
your children so that you can pass it down to them, something 
that they can benefit from -- you try and create a future for 
them, or something that they can hold on to, even though they 
might not be 
interested in farming, might have something else 
on their mind, at least you're trying to give them some kind of 
real estate or something for 
them to hold onto. 
MO: Uh huh. 
EL: 
The only time you really make your money 
in farming is when 
you sell your land or sell you estate -- that's when you're 
talking about real money, as opposed to just paying off your 
bills and trying to 
live 
comfortably through the winter. 
MO: 
Yeah, that's what fascinates me about a lot of family 
businesses, not even just the farming ones, 
but the fact that 
people are thinking in, 
say, 100 year term and not just thinking 
of their own lives, which just seems so different from working 
for a company, or something like that, you know 
EL: 
Right. 
MO: 
I found that true with cedar farming for example, where the 
life of a cedar tree 
is going to take 50 or 60 years before that 
tree 
is really a tree. 
EL: 
Right. 
MO: I mean, 
if you're thinking of profit. 
EL: 
Yes. And what's happening now, the reasons why cedar is 
becoming so expensive is because all of 
the cedar near the 
lumber yards has been cut. So they're back 
in the woods now, five 
or six miles, and they have to have 
heavy duty equipment to pull 
these trees out of the woods five 
or six miles. Then you have 
breakdowns and you have constant repairs 
MO: Uh huh. 
EL: 
So that business is not the answer, 
either. You know, what 
it used to be was good, but now you have other materials that are 
being used 
in place of cedar you know, other kinds of plastics 
and fabrics and everything so 
it really 
is not in demand as 
it 
used to be 
Then the other problem you have, too, 
is all the wood 
is used up and they're back 
in the woods now, 
like five six, seven 
miles. 
MO: 
Yeah. Let's see, 
if we can go back to the soil and the 
trees for a minute so I make sure I get this --
EL: 
Sure. 
MO: 
I understand the economics of 
it, 
but about the soil 
itself, 
do you have to fumigate it? 
EL: 
Yes. 
MO: 
And what does that entail? 
EL: 
Okay. There is an 
insect in the ground that feeds on the 
root system of the tree. It's called the nematode. And there 
is a 
chemical, 
it's called fur idan -- furidan is what we use to 
control the nematodes, 
if you don't use, okay; 
if you go through 
all 
the expense of buying the land, buying the trees and planting 
them and 
everything and you don't fumigate, there's no guarantee 
that this insect isn't going to ruin every tree 
in the orchard. 
It may do 
it 
in three or four years, or 
it may do 
it for the down 
O'Connor--85 Audiocassette logs 
page 63 
roots, seven or eight years. You may have a beautiful crop of 
peaches one year, and the next year you go to pick them, all 
the 
trees may be dead. 
MO: 
Uh huh. 
EL: 
So that's why the fumigation is very very important. 
MO: Now is that around every tree or what 
EL: 
Well, what they do 
is when they start out the orchard, when 
you know where the row 
is going to go before the tree is put into 
the ground, the fall of that season -- okay, you go 
in and you 
use the furidan and you put it right into the ground with a 
harrow. 
MO: That's what I was wondering about. 
EL: 
You put a 55 gallon drum on the back of a harrow and run 
plastic tubes down to the teeth, and you 
have controls on there, 
that you put on the back of the 
tractor. And you just go 
straight down the row of where th 
tree 
is going to go, along the 
tree row, and you fumigate the whole strip. 
MO: Uh huh. 
EL: 
So that all the bugs are killed. 
MO: So there 
is a fair amount of preparation before you start 
EL: 
Oh yeah, sure. 
MO: 
What other kinds of preparation are there? 
EL: 
Well, first of all, you have to have a soil test to find out 
if 
the PH 
is high enough. You might have to 
lime 
it, 
you have to 
fertilize it, 
you might have to do something else to the ground. 
If 
it needs potash or if 
it needs potassium or any other analysis 
that 
is usually found in fertilizer. 
You might have to level 
the ground, you may have 
disc the ground, you might have to 
fill 
in the ground where there's low spots; 
in other words, 
rests where water settle trees won't go there, so you may have 
to bring in 
loads of dirt and have it all graded and leveled 
off before you even begin thinking about having an orchard 
MO: 
Yeah. What about, say, the Pineland is notorious for its 
sugar sand and all 
kinds of . 
EL: 
Well, there are some crops that can grow in sand. There is 
one crop that grows vigorously in a wooded area -- blueberries. 
MO: Yeah. 
EL: 
Blueberries do not like cultivated soil; they would rather 
have virgin soil. Virgin soil 
is what the farmers call 
it; 
in 
other words, going into the pine barrens and knocking out five or 
ten acres of woods, just going in with bulldozers and knocking 
out everything. 
Blueberries will grow better in that ground 
because there was nothing planted in 
it, but the pine barrens. 
But it's barren, I mean, I'm talking about having nothing but 
pine trees 
in there. Blueberries will grow better there than they 
will on a farm that's been farmed for 50 or 
60 years. 
MO: Now what about peaches, though? 
EL: 
Peaches would grow better on cultivated ground. No, peaches 
would not do good 
all 
at 
because peach trees actually suck 
up everything that's 
in 
the ground. 
MO: Uh huh. 
EL: 
The best thing for peaches is a lot of fertilizer, high 
O'Connor--85 Audiocassette logs 
page 64 
ground with a lot of good drainage and constant water. 
MO: Okay. 
EL: 
Now blueberries are just the opposite 
MO: Oh? 
EL: 
Blueberries are more like a cranberry; they like low ground 
-- and not too wet, but wet enough. A blueberry is more like a 
wild bush out 
in the pines. So that's going to do better in a 
sugar, sand, 
low soil than it would on cultivated ground like 
this. 
MO: 
But peaches do 
like -- do they like this close to sea level 
kind of thing? 
EL: 
No, peaches like high ground. 
MO: Oh, they like high? 
EL: 
Yeah. 
MO: 
But actually, this isn't that high though, 
is 
it -- this 
land here? 
EL: 
Well, 
it's higher than the swamp. 
Okay, now the swamp -- 
if 
I take you down to the woods and 
I show you the stream, you can 
actually see the elevation, you can be standing next to the 
stream and you can look out, and you can see, the ground is 
higher than your head 
where the peach trees are. 
If you turn 
around and look 
towards Pine Road, you can actually see the ... 
(CUT) (END OF SIDE ONE)  
 
MO: 
Now is that gradual build up over years on purpose, that 
elevation for the peach trees? 
EL: 
No, no. 
MO: 
Oh, that was always higher land there 
EL: 
Yeah, that's just the contour of the ground. Yeah. That 
would cost you a fortune to bring loads of dirt into the ... 
MO: 
That's what I was going to say. 
EL: 
No, that wouldn't be worth it, 
it wouldn't be profitable. 
MO: 
So basically when people scoped this area out, they figured 
that it would be okay for peaches. 
EL: 
Yeah, that's why this is a money making crop, because peach 
trees can't be planted just anywhere. 
MO: 
Yeah. 
EL: 
They need a certain type of high ground, a certain type of 
stony ground, with good drainage, 
and 
if you don't have that 
you're foolish to even think about putting trees down -- because 
they won't grow. 
MO: 
So then you prepare your soil 
and 
everything? You've limed 
it, 
and put potash in and whatever else you need, and that's the fall 
four, right? 
EL: 
Right. 
MO: And you plant in the spring? 
EL: 
In the spring, yes. 
MO: 
And then how do you have to space the trees and that sort of 
thing? 
EL: 
Okay, there's basically 22 feet fro row to row, 22 feet from 
row to row and 18 feet from tree to tree. Okay, they're closer 
together on the peach row than they are as opposed to going from 
row to row. The difference is that when you farm, you do 
everything one way. 
O'Connor--85 Audiocassette logs 
page 65 
MO: Oh, I see. 
EL: 
Okay, you set the tractor, as far as cutting the grass or 
discing the orchard. You don't go the opposite way. And you try 
to --- what they're doing now is the state 
is recommending that 
you can put more trees to the acre, so they're trying to get 
the 18 feet down to 16 and they're trying to gain X amount of 
trees per acre by making the trees closer on the peach row --
still keeping the 22 feet from row to row, but making them going 
from 18 to 16. 
MO: Uh huh. 
EL: 
Now you may think that's a lot of room -- 18 feet. But it's 
not, because once the tree starts to shoot out, 
limbs, and then 
you have those trees shooting out, the trees are going to start 
touching. 
And it's okay 
if 
they touch, but once you get 
peaches 
on the limbs, and they start touching other peaches 
from the 
other trees, you're going to have bruised peaches. 
MO: 
Uh huh. 
EL: 
So there 
is a limit as to how far you can go. 
MO: 
And do you keep them trimmed and 
everything? 
EL: 
Well, what we've tried to do, and 
we were doing a little 
experiment out in the field -- instead 
of having the trees one 
after the other in a row and then having the next row alongside 
of 
it, 
the same tree one after the other -- we're trying to 
stagger the second row. 
MO: 
Uh huh. 
EL: 
So what you would have 
is you would have a tree here, a tree 
here and a tree here. Okay, and 
instead of having this type of 
effect, we would actually stagger the tree. 
MO: 
Uh huh. 
EL: 
The purpose of this 
is to get more trees into the row, to 
get more rows into the acre, but when this tree grows and gets 
big, i 
t 
' 
I 
I have this much more room to grow, as opposed to this 
way. When a tree has a lot of 
leaves on 
it and the peaches come 
out, they're going to have less room this way than you would this 
way. 
MO: 
All 
right 
EL: 
Now this 
is just an experiment we're trying. The trees are 
only two years old now, but 
in the next three or four years we 
should be able to see 
if 
it's working or not. And 
if you can 
stick more trees 
to the acre. 
Land is scarce right now, you 
know, 
land 
is expensive-- all 
the land 
is being used right now 
so whatever land you do have you're trying to get the most out of 
i 
t. 
MO: Uh huh. Let me change this. 
CUT)  
 
MO: 
We were saying now, 
if a tree lives for 15 years roughly, 
average, how many years does 
it -- and 
it takes three years 
before it bears fruit -- how many years does it take before it 
reaches kind of the size where you feel you're earning something 
at? 
EL: 
Well, I'd say going from five to ten years is a good mix. 
You're going to have some years where 
you're not going to be 
able to pick anything, you know, so 
it doesn't matter if 
the 
tree 
is three years or 
if the tree 
is seven years because you're 
O'Connor--85 Audiocassette logs 
page 66 
going to have blank years, 
you're going to have years where 
you're not going to pick anything because the weather is going 
to be that severe. 
MO: Uh huh. 
EL: 
But I would say that between five 
to ten years is a good 
average. You're going to have five 
good years on a tree; 
it's 
going to take five years for the tree to get to where it is, 
and 
when the tree is five years 
old that's when it's 
in 
its prime: 
MO: Uh huh. 
EL: 
I think that was your question? 
MO: Yeah. 
EL: Yeah, so from five to ten. And when 
it gets to ten, 
it 
starts going the other way. So you 
really only have five good 
years. 
MO: 
And then what happens -- do you replace that tree? 
EL: 
Yeah. Now once again we have 
another experiment that we're 
trying. Instead of pulling 
the tree out and starting from 
scratch, you know, fumigating 
the ground and discing, and 
striking out the rows -- wherever there 
is a dead tree, 
instead 
of pulling that tree out and 
planting one 
in 
its place, we're 
leaving the dead tree, cut it down to the stump, and we're 
planting two young trees on 
both sides of 
it. 
MO: Uh huh. 
EL: 
Okay, so what you're doing now is you're gaining one more 
tree besides the one you're planting, and you're treating those 
two trees as one. When they start to grow after two or three 
years, 
they start to form a peach tree, you actually shape those 
two trees by the time the 4th, 5th and 6th year comes, you 
try to shape those two trees into one tree. 
MO: Uh huh. 
EL: 
Where the existing tree died. 
And eventually what happens with that existing tree is that 
all decays. The stump and everything acts as fertilizer. 
MO: : Right. 
EL: 
And it's a lot easier to just stick 
two trees 
in the ground rather than to get the tractor out 
there and bulldoze it, 
and take the roots up and have the 
men go 
in there and put the tree in. And you can even do 
it 
yourself. 
MO: Yeah. 
EL: 
Just have a post hoe digger or a 
plow in the back of the tractor, and go through the orchard 
and whenever you see a dead tree, just put one on either 
side of 
it. 
If you have a completely dead orchard, but there 
is somewhat of a crop there and you don't want to go through 
the expense of tearing it all 
out and cutting the wood up for 
firewood and all that, just go 
in and stick a tree between 
every tree. 
MO: Uh huh. 
EL: 
Take and stick a young chute between every tree. 
MO: And you don't think that maintenance 
later on 
is going to 
equal the cost of --
O'Connor--85 Audiocassette logs 
page 67 
EL: 
No, as a matter of fact, 
it'll 
be easier. Number one, that 
tree, the existing tree will die, and 
it will act as fertilizer. 
Your tree will already be planted, so you won't have to wait 
three or four years and you're still picking the other trees. 
MO: 
Uh huh, sure. 
EL: 
So 
it's an experiment we're trying where we're seeing how 
that works, too. 
MO: 
How long have you been doing that? 
EL: 
This is the first year. 
MO: 
Oh, great. 
EL: 
Yeah. See, these are all 
things that we're trying because it 
goes back to that same thing --land is scarce. And time 
is 
valuable. 
MO: 
Yeah. 
EL: 
You really can't expect to go 
in there and knock out an 
orchard because half the trees are dead; knock out the orchard 
and say, "Well, I can wait three or four years for a crop." You 
can't. 
MO: 
Uh huh. 
EL: 
You have to try to get as much from that ground as you 
possibly can. Save the trees that you have, find the bore that's 
killing the tree, that's eating the tree, kill him, you know, 
paint the tree with white paint. Now these are all 
things that 
people used to do 
like maybe 20 or 30 years ago that they got 
away from. But now they're going back to 
it. 
MO: 
It's kind of preventive --
EL: 
Preventive maintenance, yeah. 
MO: And then when you plant those new 
trees, you prepare the 
soil 
in some way for those trees as well? 
EL: 
Well, the soil 
is already prepared 
MO: Once 
is enough with the fumigation. 
EL: Well, no. You fumigate every year. When you do your weed 
control -- 
in other words, when you look at an orchard, you will 
see that on the peach row, 
down the peach row, there is no 
grass. There is grass in between the peach rows, but there is no 
grass under the peach tree. That's called weed control, okay — 
that's a combination of pariquat and sinbar. Pariquat kills the 
grass immediately, burns it off topically, and the sinbar acts on 
the root system of the grass so as not to come back. 
Okay, 
it 
may come back the following year somewhat, but it won't come back 
that year. So with the paraquat and sinbar, you put the furgane 
in, 
so when you're doing your weed control you're actually 
fumigating for your trees, too, both at the same time. 
MO: 
And what do you do that with? 
EL: Furgane. 
MO: 
No, I mean machine wise. 
EL: A sprayer, a boom sprayer that goes on the front of the 
tractor, and your tank goes on the back, 
and there's a pump that 
works off the power takeoff, and that just shoots the water 
through a tube out through a pipe of nozzles that point down. 
They put that right on the peach 
row. 
MO: 
Are the tractors and things like 
that designed for this 
22 foot, 1 foot distance? 
O'Connor--85 Audiocassette logs 
page 68 
EL: Yeah, there are orchard tractors 
that you're supposed to 
use as opposed to row crop tractors open field tractors--
MO: 
And what kind of, 
is that equipment very expensive? 
EL: 
Oh sure, yeah. Anybody thinking about farming, I mean, 
starting out they have an 
idea 
in their head that they're going 
to get into farming, that they want to be a peach farmer or 
blueberry farmer or whatever, I'd advise them against it. 
MO: 
Uh huh. 
EL: 
There's no possible way that they could even think about it. 
And the only reason why I'm farming is because my family had 
it. 
If I had to go out and buy tractors and I had to go out and buy 
sprayers, not only one, but a group for each purpose, 
if I had to 
go out and buy a packing house, 
if I had to go out and buy a 
whole complete system for operating a packing house, you know and 
a refrigeration cooler and forklifts and bulk bins and 
all 
these 
things that are endless, 
it'd be well over a million dollars, you 
would invest well over a million dollars between the land and the 
equipment you need. And the time -- what about the time? 
MO: 
Uh huh. 
EL: 
You'd have to wait 3,4,5 years 
before you start getting 
this money back. So there's no possible way anybody can get 
into farming unless the farm is already established, or unless 
they're multi—millionaires and they just want to throw money 
away. 
MO: Uh huh. 
EL: 
But I could think of a lot better things to do with a 
million bucks than to start farm. 
MO: Yeah. Well, how about when you were a kid -- was this 
something that you wanted to do 
right along? 
EL: 
When I was a kid, growing up on the 
farm for me was nothing 
but work. It was a lot of hard 
work. 
MO: From what age? 
EL: 
Oh, I can remember working outside next to my mother, 
I don't know, when I was 10 or 11 
years old. 
MO: Yeah. 
EL: 
And because of this, I always felt like I wanted to do 
something else, that I didn't want to 
work this hard. 
So, 
at the age of 13, 
14 I started to get involved 
with music, 
and I had my 
little drum set that I'd go and 
practice with 
after school and I'd have a bunch of friends 
that I'd get 
together with, and sooner or later at the age of 15, I found 
myself working, you know, and working doing dance 
and then 
eventually working nightclubs. 
And from the time I was a freshman in high school 
I found myself 
working, 
like maybe not every Friday and Saturday but one night a 
week or maybe doing a wedding. I graduated from high school and I 
went to a community college and I majored in music, and I was 
thinking about going into music education because that was the 
only thing that you could go 
into, you know? 
So during that time, I had played with some bands I was with one 
O'Connor--85 Audiocassette logs 
page 69 
band for a long period of time, maybe four or 
five years, 
working down the shore, working down at Wildwood and Margate, and 
then finding out -- well, this 
is kind of empty and maybe I 
should go back to college. 
So I went to the Philadelphia Music Academy in Center City 
Philadelphia, and I went there, I took the audition, and I went 
there for maybe a half semester, and 
I got bored with that 
because everything there was kids that grew up that had lessons 
from concert masters, given to them you know, 
they were like spoiled brats, and they couldn't even play, you 
know? They couldn't play themselves out of a paper bag. 
But they 
had all 
of these things given to them; 
they had concert pianos 
given to them and they all these lessons given to them and they 
knew everything about Beethoven and Bach and Mozart, and I didn't 
want to 
learn any of that. 
I wanted to play. 
So I got out of that, and I didn't want to go back into a rock 
and roll band again, so I started studying privately with an 
outfit in Center City, I think 
it was call Music City, at 17th 
and Chestnut, and I had a percussion teacher, his name was Paul, 
and he was with me for a couple of years, and he helped me along 
with my technique and 
introduced me to different types of 
drumming -- Latin just about anything you need as far as dance, 
jazz. He died, he passed away at the age of 40 because 
worked 
too hard with his students, he drank a little too much and he 
just wanted to teach. This was his thing. Like if 
he found a 
student that he really got involved in, 
he would 
spend a lot of 
time with that student, and from there he 
would just go right to 
work -- he wouldn't even think about 
going home or eating or 
anything, he'd have his tuxedo 
in 
the back of the car and then 
he would just change and go 
to work, and sometimes he'd stay up 
for two or three days 
and do this. 
MO: Whew. 
EL: 
So at that point, I lost my teacher 
I lost my best friend, 
and I wound up going into a band 
again. And I continued doing 
that up until about 1978, 
when Atlantic City opened up. And we 
were working right 
outside of Atlantic City, a place called the 
Sand Castle, 
and we thought wow, now we made it here this 
is our 
Utopia. 
We figured we'd work a few hours a night and we'd make 
four or five hundred dollars a week, and eventually we'd be 
working at a casino, and from there we'd go to Tahoe, or 
you know --
We had one outfit come 
in Harrahs from Resorts 
International, and they hated the band, they didn't like the 
band at all, they hated the girl 
up front, they couldn't stand 
her, and they wanted to change the whole band, they wanted 
to change our outfits and our costumes and everything. 
So we wound up working this place 
in Atlantic 
City until about 
six o'clock in the morning; we'd do 
like six sets a night or 
seven sets a night, and I was bug eyed, and 
I'd be coming home 
O'Connor--85 Audiocassette logs 
page 70 
and my father would just be getting up an going to work and 
there'd be planes cruising over spraying strawberries, and I 
said, here I am -- I'm nuts, I said, I've got all 
of this, 
I'm 28 
years old and I'm breaking my back working down 
in Atlantic City 
until six o'clock 
in the morning trying to make $300 a week, and 
I must be nuts. 
So I figured the hell with this, I'm going to go back to the farm 
-- so 
in 
1378 was when I came back. And I still have my drums, I 
still have my piano, I still have my PA system, I have all 
that 
stuff, because that's something that you never part with. 
MO: Sure. 
EL: 
But it's there -- 
if I ever want 
to get back into 
it, which 
I did, for a short amount of time I got back into 
it with a 
trio. I would like to get this place established to the point 
where I don't have to be here 
in the winter time. 
MO: Uh huh. 
EL: 
And after all 
wrapped up and eve 
of my f 
i 
rewood and 
like, December up 
January, February 
musically, you kno 
something in a dif 
MO: Uh huh. 
EL: 
I would like 
what it 
is -- it's 
to 12 weeks that y 
some preparation n 
to do 
later. 
But 
MO: 
In six months 
year and everythin 
EL: 
Yeah, you can do everything you need to do 
in the six 
months. 
MO: Fine. 
EL: 
So the other six 
want. So that's basical 
MO: 
You can do whateve 
kind of year you had. 
EL: 
Right, yeah 
MO: Yeah 
EL: 
But see, then 
if you have 
something to offset it, 
if you 
have some other income coming 
in, 
it's only that much better 
MO: Uh huh. 
EL: 
Now, that was 
apples. Some years 
of the following y 
Christmas, Thanksg 
weather, 
in sub—ze 
all 
night? 
Just t 
apples away in a c 
cold storage and y 
the peaches are picked and everything is 
rything 
is put away 
in October, and I sell 
all 
everything and the bills are paid, I have 
to the beginning of March, I have December, 
and 
March to myself. And I can do something 
w I can do something on the side, I can do 
ferent part of the state. You know? 
to approach this business that I'm in now as 
a seasonal business. Peaches are basically 10 
ou harvest them. The rest of the time, you have 
ow, you know, and then you have some cleaning up 
it's only a six month business. 
you can make all 
your repairs for the next 
g? 
months, you know, you can do whatever you 
ly what I would like. 
r you can afford to do depending on the 
the bad thing about apples, when we had 
we had to pack apples all 
the way to February 
ear, we had to pack them all the way through 
iving and who wants to go out there in freezing 
ro weather and have to pack apples all day and 
o try to make it, because you put all these 
old storage building, and you're paying for 
ou're paying for rental and you're paying for 
O'Connor--85 Audiocassette logs 
page 71 
this and you're paying for that. 
There's so much more money in peaches You get your money quicker; 
you get your money in August and 
September, I suppose, as to 
waiting until December and 
January. 
MO: 
Uh huh. That does sound pretty good. 
EL: Just take 
it for what it 
is -- 
it's a seasonal business, and 
then 
in the winter time you can 
do something else. Now what I've 
been doing 
is 
I've been 
selling firewood. I've been using all 
the 
old apple trees 
and I've been contracting other farmers, 
orchards, apple orchards, and I've been chopping them up and I've 
been 
winding up with maybe 25, 30 cords. 
MO: 
This 
is 
as you've been transferring over from apples to 
peaches? 
EL: 
Yeah. 
MO: 
Okay. I don't think we talked about that on tape, but how 
have you been doing that? 
EL: 
Well, 
in other words you'll take 
a five or six acre block 
of apples and you'll 
in and 
go 
chainsaw them down, pick them 
up, throw them on the back of your truck, and then dump them 
into one big pile. 
At the end of the year when you finish with 
the peaches and everything, say some time in 
late October or 
the 
beginning of November, you'll go out there and you'll chop them 
up 
into smaller pieces with a bench saw. 
MO: Uh huh. 
EL: 
Then as you get the orders you 
can either put orders in 
paper or by word of mouth 
and 
you can get anywhere from $100 to 
$135 for a chord of 
apple wood, depending on your location 
too, 
whether it be here or Cherry Hill or Atlantic City. And you can 
do that all winter long -- I mean, eve 
if you only have 30 
chords, 
if you're talking about $125 
a chord or $120 a 
chord, you figure that the $25 or $20 is 
for overhead, you're 
still going to come out with $100 
So 
you're still going to 
come out with three grand. 
MO: Uh huh 
EL: 
And 
if you do 
it just, do 
it for the hell of 
it for having 
fun, as opposed to worrying about this and that -- 
in other 
words, 
if you've already made your money and paid your 
obligations, this money coming 
in 
is just going to be money that 
you have to help you through the winter So, 
an extra $3,000 over 
the other six months isn't too bad isn't too hard to take. 
MO: 
Uh huh. What are the kinds of overhead costs that you have 
as a peach farmer? 
EL: 
Quite a bit. Not only do you have the main costs such as 
labor, gasoline, maintenance -- you have a lot of hidden costs 
that people don't even think about. Hidden costs, I mean, 
like 
breakdowns -- 
hidden costs -- 
breakdowns in yourself, 
like 
there's a lot of mental fatigue involved in farming. 
MO: 
Yes. 
EL: You really have to be a special kind of person to be a 
farmer; you really have to want to do 
it. And sometimes you feel 
like just throwing your hands up and walking out. And other times 
you feel 
real 
good when you have days and you go outside and you 
O'Connor--85 Audiocassette logs 
page 72 
see the sun going down and you feel 
real good about what you did 
and you feel a sense of accomplishment, and a feeling of pride 
in 
your work. 
But there are some days when you just want to blow 
the place up, you just want to walk away. There's a lot 
of 
hidden costs 
in the farm. I try to do a computer spread sheet 
on starting 
from scratch, you know, like starting from the 
ground and 
buying the tree and putting it 
into the ground and the 
fertilizer that you need and all 
the chemicals that you need 
and everything. It's pretty expensive. And then you have wait, 
like I said, you have to wait the three or four years before it 
comes around. 
But you have to figure on at least a tree costing 
you at least $25, from the time that you put it 
in the ground to 
when you start picking that box to a tree. It 
is going to cost at 
least $25 a tree. So, with 100 trees to an acre, you're talking 
about $2500. Okay. 
MO: 
Uh huh. 
EL: 
Then you've got to figure the cost of the land, so you're up 
to $4,000. An easy $4,000. 
MO: What about things like tools and machinery nd stuff like that? 
What do you need 
in that vein 
EL: 
Blueberries are so much different than peaches -- blueberries, 
the only thing you need 
is a tin shack out in the middle of the 
field. You don't need anything. All 
you need 
is a tin shack and you 
need some ladies out there and somebody with some flats, carrying 
the flats, and you just take the whole thing right out of the 
container and dump it in, 
and put a piece of cellophane on, 
and 
you're done. 
MO: 
Uh huh. 
EL: 
With peaches, you've got to have 
bins -- that's the first 
thing you have to have. 
If you don't use baskets, you've got to 
have bulk bins, and they cost $40-50 each. Then you've got to 
have bin wagons to carry the bins. They cost about $2,000 each; 
and 
if you don't have them, you've got to go out and make them. 
MO: 
They hook on to your tractor? 
EL: 
They hook onto the tractor. They carry 4 or 5 or 6 bins 
in 
the back. 
MO: 
Uh huh. 
EL: 
Then you've got to have a forklift and you know what they 
cost. And 
if you can't afford to buy one, you've got to rent one. 
Then you've got to have a hydro—cooler. Okay, when the bins come 
in and you pick them up with a forklift, you stick these gigantic 
bins full of a thousand pounds of peaches into this hydro—cooler. 
MO: 
I remember seeing that, yeah. 
EL: 
That gets packed with ice or has some kind of refrigeration 
ice making machine where it keeps the water down to 35 degrees. 
MO: 
So you have to supply the ice for that? 
EL: 
Yeah, or the refrigeration system to make the ice. 
MO: 
. Yeah. 
EL: 
And when your peaches come out of the field, they may be 100 
degrees or better, depending on the type of day 
it 
is. 
You can't 
stick that big block of heat into the cold storage without first 
putting it 
in the hydro— cooler because if you did, you'd blow 
O'Connor--85 Audiocassette logs 
page 73 
the compressors up. 
MO: 
Uh huh. 
EL: 
You stick one block in there it's not too bad, but if you 
stick 20, 30 or 40 or 50 and create gigantic block with a density 
that is unbelievable, before you can get into the center, there's 
no way that those compressors are going to handle that. 
MO: 
Uh huh. 
EL: 
Which means that that pit will never get cold enough to be 
able to make it to Boston or 
be able to make 
it to Baltimore, or 
wherever the peaches are going. 
MO: 
So most of the rot, then, would come from the pit and work 
its way out. 
EL: 
Right. The purpose of the hydro— cooler is to get that pit 
as close to 35 degrees as possible to maintain it, 
so 
it will be 
able to travel that long distance before 
it starts to ripen 
MO: 
Right. 
EL: 
Those little coolers that you 
see on the tractor trailers 
don't do that; the only thing 
they do 
is they keep the 
temperature inside the truck at like 
a certain temperature, 
maybe 38 to 42 degrees. Some won't even do that--
MO: Uh huh. 
EL: 
So they're not really cooling the 
peach, just the air 
is being 
cooled. So that's another thing you need, 
is a hydro— cooler. Then 
you need a packing house you need all that sizing equipment, you need 
all 
those belts and conveyors and chains. And you need a 
refrigeration system to put the packed boxed into once they're 
packed, 
because maybe they're not going to be sold that day, maybe 
they're going to be sold the following day -- so you need a 
refrigeration system. 
MO: 
And they're packed into boxes that go 
in bins again? 
EL: 
No -- they're packed 
in peach crates. 
MO: Oh, crates. 
EL: 
That go on pallets, and they get strapped down. 
MO: All 
right, I see. 
EL: 
Then you put 40 or 50 on a pallet. 
MO: Oh, okay. 
EL: 
Then you might load a tractor trail and put 20 pallets to a 
tractor trailer. So 
if you have 50 boxes on the pallet times 20, 
you're talking about 1,000 boxes to a tractor. 
MO: And how many pounds are 
in a box? 
EL: 
Thirty eight. 
MO: Boy, that's a lot of peaches 
EL: 
We usually pack 
in 40, 
so you figure 40 times 50 
is 2,000. So 
every pallet weighs a ton, so 20 pallets is 20 tons of 
peaches. 
MO: Whew. 
EL: 
If you can pack that every day, 
you're doing good. 
MO: Okay. 
EL: 
Yeah, that's a good farmer, that's a good peach farmer, 
somebody who can put out 20 tons a day. 
MO: 
Do you have the kind of acreage where you can actually do 
that? 
EL: 
We have the acreage, but we don't have the fruit this year 
O'Connor--85 Audiocassette logs 
page 74 
because we got wiped out. That's what we're trying to do,we're 
trying to establish ourselves to the point where we can have 100 
acres of peaches. 
MO: Uh huh. 
EL: 
Once we hit that mark of having 100 acres of peaches, then 
we shouldn't have any problem of packing 1,000 a day. 
MO: And you made this big transition, 
you said the last time I 
was here, from baskets, which I'll 
get some pictures of 
hopefully, and then into these big bins which you dump over 
with the forklift into the hydro— cooler. 
EL: 
Yes, right. 
MO: Could you talk a little bit about 
that, on when you made 
the transition and why you made the 
transition? 
EL: 
Basically, to be able to plant more trees and be able to 
have more yield -- to have a bigger yield, to keep up with 
production. But the baskets are limited to how many boxes you can 
pack. You're limited to how many baskets you can put on a truck 
or a wagon, and 
you're going to take a man's time to dump that, 
carrying a man's baskets one by one, to the conveyor belt. And once 
again, 
you won't be able to hydro—cool them once they're 
in 
the 
basket; the only way you can hydro—cool 
it 
is to hydro—cool the 
box after it's packed, you can run the box through the hydro— 
cooler. 
MO: Uh huh. 
EL: 
That's the way they used to do 
it. 
But the way they do 
it 
now 
is to hydro—cool the whole bin when it comes out of the field 
and put it away and then pack the peaches when you get the order. 
MO: Right, when you get the order. 
EL: 
Yeah. You can use a basket, dump the basket on the conveyor, 
use the man and pay him for his time and everything, and then 
have the box packed and run 
it through the hydro—cooler and put 
it away. 
But you may not sell that peach that day, and 
you may 
not sell 
it the next day, either -- 
it may take two days to sell 
that peach. Then it's going to go either to a vine and produce 
auction or it's going to go to New York, Hunts Point, or what 
or then it may 
lie 
in someone's trailer overnight. 
Then it 
might go to Wakefern up 
in north Jersey or some big food 
distributor, and it might sit there for a couple of days. Then 
it might go to the supermarket and 
it may sit there 
for a day. 
So 
it may take a week before it hits the housewife 
and by that 
time the peach is 
rotten. 
MO: Uh huh. 
EL: 
I suppose, to keeping the peaches 
in the cooler, getting 
the orders from Wakefern and everything, okay -- having a broker 
that delivers the produce there 
direct, 
it may only take half 
the amount of time and your 
peach 
is already frozen -- or not 
frozen, gut it's already chilled to a point where it's not 
going to ripen. 
So which is the better way? The way that you 
use the bin and you put it away and you pack the peaches as 
you 
need them, as opposed to packing them all at once. 
O'Connor--85 Audiocassette logs 
page 75 
MO: 
Uh huh. So you have a broker who 
you're in touch with 
constantly then? 
EL: 
Yes. 
MO: 
You tell him what you've got, he 
tells you what he needs, 
and so on? 
EL: 
Exactly. 
MO: 
And then the tractor trailer pulls 
up --
EL: 
Right. 
MO: And then you -- how does the 
broker operate? Does he get a 
certain percentage of 
it, 
or how does that work? 
EL: 
Well, 
like there's a FOB cost, a freight on board cost, and 
that's the standard price for the day. Whatever he makes above that 
... 
(INTERRUPTION) 
There's a freight on board cost, an FOB cost, 
and that's the market price for that day for what the 
farmer is 
supposed to get on the farm. And whatever the 
broker makes above 
that is his business. The farmer really 
can't say, 
"Well, you bought peaches for $10 and you sold them for $13, you 
made three dollars." Well, we can't say that -- 
that's up to the 
broker to do whatever he wants. 
MO: Uh huh. 
EL: 
Now, the smart farmer will know that the market price 
is 
$13, and he'll question the broker and say — he won't question 
him for what they're being sold for, but he'll say these are 
quality peaches, and you only want to give me ten dollars; I have 
a feeling that the market price is $13, and I feel 
like I should 
get more money for them. 
MO: Uh huh. 
EL: 
You know, the farmer should always 
stand up, 
if 
he feels 
like the peaches are worth more than what the market price is. 
MO: 
Yeah -- so you have to keep abreast 
of what's happening on the 
market. 
EL: 
Right, yeah. 
MO: 
So what do you do, how do you do that? 
EL: 
Well, they have a price program now where they have 
computers involved, and they have market price readouts going 
into these computers from different terminals -- New York and 
Boston and what have you. And 
these are constantly being sent 
out to the farmers, either in the form of a newsletter or by 
telephone. That keeps the farmer aware of what the prices are. 
MO: 
That's great. 
EL: 
If you can get a shrewd broker, he just say, 
"I 
can buy them 
for six dollars and sell them for $12." 
MO: 
Yeah, sure. (INTERRUPTION FROM MRS. LAMONACA) 
MO: 
So what about your employees and 
stuff -- are you able to 
take care of most of 
it yourself with your dad or do you have to 
hire people to pick, or how does that work? 
EL: 
Uh huh. We have Mexicans that we try to get back every year; 
we try to get the same ones that come back. And what's happening 
now 
is they're starting to bring their sons and their cousins or 
their relatives. 
MO: 
How interesting. 
EL: 
And we try to keep 
it down to one 
or two families, you 
know, as opposed to having Puerto 
Ricans here and Laotians here 
O'Connor--85 Audiocassette logs 
page 76 
and different nationalities coming 
in where you don't know one 
from the other 
MO: 
Do these Mexicans live here all year round? 
EL: No. They live here until 
it starts getting cold, to the 
middle of October, and then they go back to Mexico. And they'll 
get in touch with us 
in the spring of the year and they'll want 
to know if we need help and when we want them to come. And 
usually what we'll do 
is we'll pick ...

TXO1: 
EL:(CONTINUING) Really, they've got 
it made, because 
Mexicans make 57 cents an hour that's their 
minimum wage down 
in Mexico. Here it's $3.35 
ML: They're good workers, too. 
EL: They're very good workers, that's 
why we use 
them. 
MO. Uh huh. 
EL: 
They have 
it made. They have 
it 
made as far as 
they don't have to pay any rent, housing room 
and board --
nothing like that The only thing they pay for 
food. We take 
them to the store and we bring them home. We 
used to take them 
to church -- we used to have a priest come 
here. 
We provided 
everything for them, everything imaginable 
MO. So where do they live while they're 
here? 
EL: 
In a labor camp down the street. 
ML: They can rent an apartment like a lot of the 
other day workers but they can choose to 
live 
in 
labor camps. 
MR. Uh huh. Do you pay their transportation both ways or do they 
pay going back or what? 
EL: Usually, yeah. 
MO. When do they begin? 
EL: April or May, I'd say by about May 15th we usually 
have 5 to 6. And that's more than we need for that time of year. 
By August, we usually have maybe 10, 
11 
or 12. 
MO. And that's in? 
EL: July. Right now we probably have or 8 of them over 
there . 
MO. And what kind of work are they doing 
EL: Right now they're thinning peaches taking some off 
because there's too many, or they might be hoeing cucumbers, 
taking out the grass. There might be some tractor work involved, 
you know, 
if somebody knows how to drive and has a license and all 
that. But basically, maintenance --you know, tree maintenance, 
trying to preserve trees from dying, take care of the grass. 
MO. I can turn this off 
if you'd want. I wanted to ask you why 
the labor thing was a touchy subject 
EL: Yeah. 
MO. Do you want me to turn it off? 
O'Connor--85 Audiocassette logs 
page 78 
EL: Go ahead, yeah. (CUT)  
 
MO. This is just in response to how this stuff can possibly be 
used. One thing I know that people are interested in 
is opinions 
about land uses. We've got 
all these questions about should 
people be able to build houses here or there, should a 
developer be able to come 
in 
and that kind of thing. 
EL: Uh huh. 
MO. And I wanted to know your opinions about that from a farming 
point of view, about how lands should be used. For example, 
cranberry farmers need water, but it's not necessarily part of 
their land or nearby, but that's going to be coming in through 
streams. And so a development down the way can really affect 
their water table and stuff like that. 
EL: Right. 
MO. Do you have feelings about how the land should be used from 
a farmer's point of view? 
EL: Yes. From a farmer's point of view I feel that 
farm areas should remain farm areas. But on the other hand, 1 
feel that a farmer working all 
of his life building something 
for their children, building some kind of a future or whatever, 
should have the right, 
if 
he wants to subdivide the land to a 
certain amount of acres per house, 
should be able to sell 
1,2 
or 3 acres, whatever, to a person in the family or to a close 
friend or something, you know —it shouldn't be a thing where you 
have to have one house for 20 acres, 20 acres would mean that 
you can have one house. 
MO. Uh huh. 
EL: I feel 
it's up to the farmer who should 
determine whether he can block out two acres and 
sell them to a 
close friend or relative --because after all 
like I said, the 
only money that the farmer is going to get, 
any real money, 
comes when he sells his estate. 
MO. Uh huh. 
EL: So I think 
it should be up to the farmer to 
determine whether or not he should be able to have a house built 
down the street or next to him or across the way, or whatever. 
MO. Yes. 
EL: And I think there is too much emphasis on the fact 
that it's the state that has to decide whether or not there are 
certain living conditions. That's just the way I feel about it. 
ML: Yes, but a farmer wouldn't sell 
to say, somebody 
who put up a development because he doesn't need all those 
people around and everything else --plus you'd mess up the water 
table. You're not going to sell to a bunch of 
idiots running 
through your field; you don't want i this kind of thing. Farmers 
generally live away, 
like they just don't build things 
in a 
housing development, because that part of their field and that's 
the money they get for eating and stuff and for bills. I don't 
think they'd say, "Okay, we'll put five acres here and we'll put 
up two story townhouses." Because you can't have 
it. 
EL: Yeah, I don't think a farmer would do that. 
ML: They wouldn't. 
EL: No, I don't think a farmer would say that "I'm 
O'Connor--85 Audiocassette logs 
page 79 
going to build a housing development here or I'm going to put up 
a nightclub here or I'm going to have a supermarket here." 1 
don't think a farmer in his right mind would do that. But I 
don't think, by the same token, that a farme should be able to 
say, "Well, I'm going to block out three acres for my son 
in 
law 
or my cousin or my good friend down the street." You know, that 
should be up to the farmer. 
ML: Well, 
it's part of your heritage, too. Other 
people get a house where maybe their parents live or something. 
And that's part of your heritage -- 
if your parent chooses to 
give 
it to you before he dies and 
lets you reap the benefit of 
having a home, that's one thing, because you have to 
live next 
to the land. 
EL: Right -- the land is what you work for, 
it's what 
you're sweating for, and when somebody else 
is telling you that 
you can't do anything with it, I think that's a problem. 
MR. Yeah. It seems to me that the other people I talked with 
came up with the same thing maybe in different words, but 
whatever their job was 
in 
relation to the land it seemed that 
the 
logic of the working that they did with their land made it 
almost impossible then for them to choose to do something 
foolish with it. 
EL: Uh huh. 
MO. And 
it seemed that these people are 
the authorities, and 
that's kind of one of the things we've been trying to get at --
is, 
you have a lot of knowledge and 
experience; 
it has a logic 
to 
it, and 
if we can kind of play out that logic, maybe 
it can 
be translated to people who don't necessarily have the direct 
experience, but they're in policy positions and they need to 
know. 
EL: The Pinelands Commission are very aware of what is 
going on, but they don't have the every day existence that we 
have, they don't have the practical knowledge that we have because 
we're here. They're sitting up there in Trenton or wherever, and 
they're saying that it has to be done this way, you know, and 
the governor is saying it has to be done this way, you know. And 
that's fine. But they don't live here, they don't know what's 
happening, they don't know if something is being contaminated or 
if 
it 
is or isn't. You know, so they're making public decisions 
up there, but what about the farmer? 
MO. Uh huh. 
EL: I mean he should have some say 
in the matter, 
shouldn't he? That's the way we feel about it. 
MO. Yeah. Do you feel that there are, say, different regions 
within the Pinelands that would act 
differently according to 
the way they use their land, and 
that kind of thing? 
EL: Yeah, there are certain perimeters of the 
Pinelands, preservation areas that shouldn't be touched for, 
like you said, water reasons or whatever or 
timber line 
reasons. And these parts should remain preservation they shouldn't 
be touched. But then there are other perimeters, you know, the 
may be on highway or whatever, 
like this, and that should 
entitle that property owner to do with it whatever he wants 
O'Connor--85 Audiocassette logs 
page 80 
because of his location. 
MO: Uh huh. 
ML: Because you're working for it all 
your life. I 
mean, what happens -- like our father in 
law, how old 
is daddy? 
EL: 77. 
ML: 77. Now if Eddie weren't here, say he wanted to 
sell 
the place because he got tired of working, I mean, he's 
only a one man .show there, what can he do? He 
lives here, but if 
he needs to make money he'd have to sell the place 
if he 
couldn't afford the place, 
like if he were bedridden, God forbid 
or something like that. See you can't do that. 
EL: 
If I wasn't interested in taking over the farm and 
he had to come up with a deal where he had to sell 
or 
something, he would have to sell 
the property 
at a farm value. 
In other words, Farmers Home would have to come 
in and say the 
land was worth so much, 
instead of selling it to somebody who 
was going to put a horse farm here or 
somebody who was going to 
buy 
it from the state, from north Jersey, or whatever, not a 
farmer. Okay. You couldn't. It would have to be sold to another 
farmer. In other words, they're giving you the right to farm. 
Big deal. 
ML: But it means that he would lose his home, and he 
also couldn't subdivide the land and build another home, because 
he doesn't have the money, right? 
EL: Right. 
ML: And just sell the whole parcel and say I'm going 
to keep five acres here for me. Because he can't keep five acres 
he has to maintain eight. And how can somebody of that age, 
if 
something happens to them, maintain all that just to get a 
place? It's very hard for someone to go and live 
in an apartment 
dwelling that's lived outside and 
worked outside all 
their 
life. 
It would kill them. I mean, 
his father works day and 
night all 
the time. But he lives and he works and does a very 
good job. But he can't even provide for himself, say, he has to 
make plans for his future, of where he's going to be. 
He 
couldn't, before the sale, subdivide a large portion and 
have a 
sum of money to subsidize building a place to 
live. 
MO: Uh huh. 
ML: I mean, to put this man 
in a condo 
would be 
insane, 
it'd be 
like cutting his arms off. 
I don't know, when 
you see people who farm all 
the time, you just see that this 
is 
where they belong, that type of thing, and you're cutting off a 
lot of their rights. I mean, you should save the water for the 
future, because without water you can't live. 
It's a very 
important thing. But then they shouldn't regulate it. 
(CUT) 
MR. : What was 
it, Tuckahoe Turf? 
ML: Tuckahoe Truck farms, because there aren't any 
large pieces of 
land left. Now, 
the thing with th farmers, 
it preserves the land because you can 
eat --74 percent of the people that are farmers, I think there 
are 
like 110 peach farmers in New Jersey. And you have to 
preserve the water for the future, you shouldn't loot it or 
O'Connor--85 Audiocassette logs 
page 81 
anything else like this, with developments, because people 
act 
like pigs when they come down here 
in the fields. People from 
the city, they sneak in and pick your fruit and they make a 
mess. You know, they pollute the 
water, they throw trash on the 
roads, because we get it all 
the time outside. 
MO: Uh huh. 
ML: And you should maintain that, I really believe 
that -- but they want you to register wells. 
I mean, 
if we 
want to put in another well because we need it, 
we had to go 
through all this red tape. You know. 
MO: 
Is that recent? 
ML: I really don't know, I don't know Because we put 
a well on, I guess on Oak Road 
in I guess it was '81, or I don't 
know when it was. But we had to get a loan for it and go through 
all 
of this and have 
it dug and 
everything. And there's 
underground forests under there, and I can see, there probably is 
very heavy gas resources around here because of 
it, because of 
the location, across from the county and 
in Baltimore County, 
than it 
is 
in the state. 
If you study the earth, 
it was probably 
a large river bed at one time. 
MR. Uh huh. 
ML: But I'm not sure because I'm not 
into geology. 
But you can't let people mess it up, you really can't -- because 
there's nothing left in north Jersey. 
I mean, 
if there were a 
nuclear fallout, this land would be useless, and you'd have to 
dig up the concrete and start farming that, that's the only way 
you could do that. Because you couldn't grow anything out here 
if there were a fallout or something. But if we have to depend 
on California and the southern parts for our food -- you know 
how much that costs 
in the winter for your vegetables and 
things? 
MO: Oh yeah. 
ML: There's not many farms left. 
M0: Yeah. 
ML: And 
it costs a lot to operate them more than you 
would think. 
M0. Yeah, we've been talking a little bit about 
that. 
ML: Much more; I'm sure 
it's over $100,000 for this, 
well over it for labor and maintenance and upkeep of the land. 
But as far as selling, though, he would never sell 
and have a 
bunch of people next to him running all over the place and making 
a mess. And you couldn't, 
it's not fair, then you'd have 
sewerage and everything else would go crazy, and 
it would cost 
the town and 
it would be one less piece of, you know --I mean, 
what is the benefit of having 20 people here when you could feed 
maybe 3,000 off of the land? Do you know what I mean? 
MO: Sure, I know exactly what you mean. 
ML: I mean, we need it with the housing growth, with 
the casinos and such. But they messed up all 
the prices. You 
know, 
it's escalating, which is good, but then people can't

inland. 
MO: Uh huh. 
ML: Like 
in town, there's one set of condos and there 
are two apartment houses, and that's it. Otherwise, you've 
got to buy a house. 
MO: That's amazing. 
ML: I mean, we couldn't get into them you'd have to 
wait three years to get an apartment in town 
MO: Wow. 
HL: This 
is my father. 
MO: Oh, very nice to meet you. Let me turn this off. (CUT) 
 
INTERVIEW WITH MR. LAMONACA, SENIOR: 
HL: -- my dad bought this place at that time, and the 
first 20 acres were vineyards. And that 
was a common crop in 
the area. And he made a living out of this. 
MO: And that was on this site? 
HL: On this site. Yeah, not in this particular site 
where we are now. The other end of this lot, that was 
acres, the first lot he bought. And as he progressed, he 
bought more land, and it totaled 55 acres. 
MO: Oh, I see. 
HL: There were small farms then, there were small 
family farms. 
MO: Uh huh. 
HL: They grew berries and vegetables --but his first 
place was a vineyard It went well until 
Prohibition came along 
MO: Yeah? 
HL: And he couldn't sell the wine. 
So he had to 
pull 
the vineyard out and he started planting vegetables, 
peaches and other crops. 
MO: I see -- and did he 
live down there at the time? 
HL: Yeah, 
it was a home on the other end of the farm, 
but it's not there now. 
MO: Uh huh. 
HL: We didn't need 
it for labor because we had a 
regular labor camp. So we got rid of 
it. I wish I hadn't because 
the Pinelands came along and I could have saved the home. But 
the Pineland issue was as 
long as the home was there, you could 
revive it, 
renovate it, 
and there was a home on the other plots, 
too, but they were all 
removed. 
MO: Oh, that's too bad. 
HL: 
It was too bad. 
MO: Because now you're not allowed to build new structures. 
HL: Yes. As long as there was a well there and there 
was a sewer system, 
it was perfectly all 
right to continue the 
use of the old home. But once 
it was discontinued and removed, 
you can't put it back. 
MO: Yeah. So you were one when your dad started this 20 acre 
vineyard. 
HL: Yeah, and I don't remember it now! 
MO: Right. So then, when did -- do you remember when you 
moved into this house? 
O'Connor--85 Audiocassette logs 
page 83 
HL: 
It could have been in, 
let me think for a moment 
-- about 1920. 
In 1920. This was a coach 
stop, and I don't 
know if 
it was at the time, but previous to that it was a coach 
stop. This was sort of a hotel and the garage here was the baker 
shop, and the baker who made the bread lived upstairs on the 
second floor. 
MO: Uh huh. 
HL: And that qas furnished with plaster you know, 
it 
made a home. Now it's just a shell, and a work place. But there 
was a large oven that occupied the space of a three car garage, 
and that's what there is now. But originally there was a big 
oven there -- and my brother and 
I, who was two years older 
than me, we moved that and made a garage out of 
it. 
MO: And how many brothers and sisters did you have here? 
HL: Three brothers, two and myself and 
four sisters. 
MO: That's quite a good sized family. 
HL: Yes. One sister is deceased, but th others are 
still 
living. 
MO: Fantastic. Eddie said something about the fact that the 
original house was the front room, and this particular summer 
kitchen was attached. 
HL: That was the kitchen, 
it was attached to the house. 
MO: Uh huh. And then you --
HL: My dad made the addition 
MO: Oh, your dad did 
it himself 
HL: Yeah, he did it. 
MO: Oh, I see — it's a huge addition--
HL: Yeah. Well, the family was large, 
it was the 
belief in those days, that families were large and that's how it 
was 
ML: He built this room. 
HL: I built the back room there. 
ML: He built everything else, he makes everything 
else. 
MO: That's 
another da 
HL: Well, 
scarce, so 
ambition, 
was basic 
app Ii cat io 
north way. 
me i 
n as a 
MO: Oh rea 
HL: Sure d 
MO: And wh 
HL: I live 
yeah. 
MO: Uh huh 
HL: And I had to find some way to make 
some money. 
MO: Yeah, I understand. 
HL: Then the war broke out and things changed, and 
this was strictly a body factory for trucks and autos, and we 
O'Connor--85 Audiocassette logs 
page 84 
what I heard, that was another subject maybe for 
y, 
but I'm fascinated by tool making. 
this was during the Depression and money was 
even on the farm it was very tough. So I had a lot of 
and went to school 
in Philadelphia as a machinist, 
it 
training. And when I was 
in training, I put in an 
n to Bud's Bodies, Edward T. Bud had a factory up the 
After a couple months, they called me 
in, 
they took 
n apprentice. And I stayed there eight years. 
IIy? 
id. 
ere did you live at that time? 
d in Pennsylvania. I was married then, 
didn't have enough work for, they weren't tooled up for army 
material, really, so I came back on the farm. 
MO: And what year was that? 
HL: Oh, when did the war break out? I can't remember. 
ML: 
In '45. 
HL: Yeah, 
it was those years. 
MO: So then you still do some tool making I see. 
HL: I did then. I started as an apprentice, and I kept 
moving up from department to department and I did pretty well. 
Then I came back on the farm, and 
I used my skills for making 
many things on the farm, making these special tools. 
MO: Like what? 
ML: Oh, 
if anything breaks, he fixes it. 
HL: 
In fact, I made the first four row planter used in 
this area. I made it. 
18 
MO: No kidding. What is a four row planter? 
HL: You can plant four rows of any kind of plants at 
one time. 
MO: 
Is 
it still out here? 
HL: No, 
it's not here now -- we don't grow vegetables 
any more now. It's strictly all orchards there. 
MO: Yeah. 
HL: At the time, I was the first one that built it 
because we were raising a large acreage of tomatoes and sweet 
potatoes and such crops that needed transplanters to plant these 
plants. 
MO: Uh huh. 
HL: 
It used to be one row, then two rows, and I was 
the first one to make the four row. And then other farmers that 
were raising a large acreage, they picked it up and brought it 
to a machine shop and had 
it duplicated. Well, I made the first 
one. 
MO: Fabulous. I guess I'm jumping all over the place here, 
it's 
pretty exciting. Back a ways now, 
going back to when you were a 
kid, you had two other brother now, right? 
HL: Right. 
MO: And did you all 
buy -- did you all 
p: 
on going into farming 
because your dad was a farmer? 
HL: Well, that was customary. Whatever the father 
was 
in -- especially with European people, what the father 
does, the children do. 
MO: And did your brothers go 
into 
it with 
HL: Yeah, we were a partnership, a three brother 
partnership. 
MO: Uh huh. And how long did that last? 
HL: Until around 10 years ago I guess. 
ML: Eddie and I have been married almost 11 years 
was 
it '70? 
HL: Yeah, we dissolved the partnership we had an 
internal problem and we resolved it. And I remained here on the 
old homestead. 
MO: And are they farming somewhere else? 
HL: No, 
in fact, the older brother passed away, I may 
O'Connor--85 Audiocassette logs 
page 85 
have forgotten to mention that. And the other brother is 
retired. And his daughter has a blueberry farm and many 
greenhouses, and he helps her out, according to his ability, 
because he's retired and can't do too much. 
MO: Uh huh. From the vineyard, you have the 20 acres, or your 
father did --
HL: Yes, at the time. 
MO: Then did he bottle? 
HL: No, he sold more or less wholesale. 
Gee, 
it's 
raining. 
MO: I better roll 
up my windows. (CUT)  
 
HL: He sold wine, 
in 55 gallon barrels right. 
MO: Oh, so he made the wine himself 
HL: He made the wine himself. We were boys and we could 
help out, help grind the grapes and all 
that. We had two horses 
and two cows, and of course it's customary to trade on anyone's 
return, and 
if we were to sell them one or two bottles of wine, 
he'd roll 
up on the wagon and run to the railroad station. And 
there probably were some markets there, that's where most of 
it 
went. 
MO: I see. Then what happened in terms of crops? It sounds like 
you've gone through lots of crops. 
HL: Right, yes. It's a good area for berries, 
strawberries, raspberries, blackberries, and there were a few 
peach growers -- and then it got to be a peach area. Berries are 
hard to get picked because it's all 
by hand. Peaches are easy to 
pick and more acreage went into the peaches. 
MO: Uh huh. 
HL: Then, apples. Our farm was all 
apples at one time 
before the peaches. 
MO: So I heard, yeah. 
HL: And we had to get off of that because we're 
competing with high country apples, mountain apples. They get 
ruby red, and we cannot get that because we're almost sea level 
here. 
MO: Uh huh. That's one thing I didn't quite get before. 
What is the actual difference? Is 
it 
weather difference or soil 
difference or what? 
HL: A combination, yeah. Mountain apples have cool 
nights -- apple needs cool nights, that's 
where they get their 
color. 
MO: Uh huh. 
HL: And sunny days. But here nights are warm, and our 
apples get yellow, and they don't get color and we can't market 
them. It was okay when the mountain areas didn't get into heavy 
production, then we got by. But then we started getting hurt --
there were many apples 
in the area, many acres, and they all 
have to get removed. 
MO: You mentioned also that you had a large crop of tomatoes at 
one time and that sort of thing? 
HL: Right. 
MO: When was that? 
HL: This was 
in the thirties and 
forties. 
O'Connor--85 Audiocassette logs 
page 86 
MO: And those were for sale as well, 
not just for yourselves. 
HL: Oh yeah, there were canned tomatoes.It was a 
stable crop here, we stored the crop in the fall and sold it 
through the winter. It was like putting money in the bank --
which is a good crop. But they got overdone. 
Many farms 
increased, and the markets couldn't absorb this amount of 
volume, so we had to get out of 
it. 
MO: Uh huh 
HL: That's when we went to fruit. 
Fruit was a little 
better. 
MO: Yeah. It sounds like peaches 
is pretty ideal. 
HL: Yes. I like peaches. Totally, 
lately it's 100 
percent. 
MO: Wait a minute, I may have understood you wrong, can you say 
that again? 
HL: 
I'm going into acreage for 100 percent in peaches. 
MO: Oh, okay. And you're at what now? 
HL: 
In the young trees, I still plant some vegetables, 
I plant some cucumbers. That's a fast crop, and it's three or 
four months, and it helps, whatever culture you give the 
cucumbers, the peach trees absorb that culture, too, and they 
grow very healthy 
MO: Did you remember the building 
hotel, anything like that? 
HL: I don't remember the activity, but the back room 
was a bar, because my brother Joseph and I, 
we moved the bar, 
it was a redwood bar, and 
it was a shame, 
we didn't know the 
value of 
it. A redwood bar, 
it was. Then the front was built 
like a storefront, 
it had a large door. 
In fact, the door is 
used on that little building out there. You can see it, 
it's not 
a house door, 
it's a large door and 
it has two plate glass 
windows on the side just like a store. 
ML: Well 
the glas 
HL: No, 
done on 
standard 
MO:. Uh 
right? 
HL: Yeah 
here. 
MO: And did they 
HL: Yes. The hors 
covered wagon, I 
on the side, 
it w 
here. 
MO: The block bui 
HL: That's where 
MO: And that's wh 
HL: Right, yes. 
MO: Boy, that's a

If you follow 
roads, you can se 
as a stage stop at all or as a

in the front 
room, 
isn't it,

these are 
like stores, break glass. 
It was 
an angle, 
like all the old stores were. Th 
front to the store, and that's what it wa

they made bread

would say, wasn't a round thing with 
as more of a delivery wagon. But that

was still

is that where --
the barn was, yeah. 
ere they would keep horses overnight? 1 
mazing. 
the roots of the highways here, the 
e that it was a trail, because it's not a 
O'Connor--85 Audiocassette logs 
page 87 
straight road. You come down Montgomery Avenue, down Pine Road 
out Columbia Road, and went to Bastelle, which was an 
historical place --
MR. Could you actually do that route, do 
you know it? 
HL: Well, I was too small to know that.But the older 
people that lived here a long time before they explained it all 
to me. 
MO: Uh huh. 
HL: Yes. 
MO: And 
it went from Glassboro to --
HL: I don't know where it started, how far it went, I 
know it came through Winslow Junction. 
Anyway, 
it came down 
Cemetery Avenue, it's not a straight road, you can see 
it here. 
This one mile here is straight, 
then it turns down here and 
goes out Columbia Road. That's a winding road, see. 
MO: Yeah, 
it 
is. 
ML: That's how you took vegetables to market, wasn't 
it? Isn't that how they took the vegetables to market? 
HL: Well, Winslow Junction, that's the old Whitehurst 
Pike, 
it went to Camden. Yes, that was the route. 
MO: I used to remember passing by farms and pick up produce on 
the way and that kind of thing. 
HL: Yeah, right. Way back at that time, 
it was all 
moved by wagons to Philadelphia, and then 
25 the trucks 
started, and 
it went to Newark. And there was 
no tunnel, 
it had 
to be ferried across the river to New 
York. 
ML: There's a lot of history back here. 
MO: Yeah. 
HL: There was a railroad, you know and a Iot of the 
produce and fruit and all went on railroad cars. It was two 
stations in Hamilton, there's only one now, and there's one now 
that goes to central goes to north You had to get the product at 
the station real early about three o'clock in the afternoon to 
get to Newark on time so they could unload the cars and get it 
on the ferries and 
get it over to the cities. 
MO: That's great. 
ML: Long trail. 
MO: Yeah. The timing was still 
important then, too, right? 
HL: Right, yeah. 
MO: And 
it would be able to make everything, be able to get 
there fresh? 
HL: Right. And you had to be there ear 
in the morning, 
I think three o'clock was the deadline 
MO: Did you do 
it daily? 
HL: Daily, with a horse and wagon. 
MO: So it wasn't a great quantity, but you were constantly 
doing this, right? 
HL: Right. 
ML: 
It used to be a heck of a ride 
to Philadelphia. 
HL: We only went to the railroad station. 
There were two 
in Hamilton and one 
in Elam. It's not there now, though, there's 
nothing there now. 
ML: Right. 
O'Connor--85 Audiocassette logs 
page 88 
END OF SIDE ONE) 
MO: Because I guess before you had to supply all 
your own 
transportation to the railroad, which meant wagons. 
HL: Yeah, 
it was all 
done with horse and wagon, yeah. 
Then when the trucks started coming 
in here at that time, they 
had solid tires, there were different trucks -- anyway, that was 
very convenient. As soon as we 
loaded the trucks, we'd call New 
York and we'd tell them the truck was on 
its way and we gave him 
the breakdown of i the merchandise that was going there, and 
he'd start selling it. 
MO: To grocers and things? 
HL: Yeah, to their customers 
MO: Uh huh. 
HL: When you made that phone call, 
the really 
appreciated it because they would start selling before it 
ever got there. 
ML: They made money. 
HL: Yeah, because the customers knew 
the product you 
were buying every day. 
MO: Sure. I heard that the barn, when 
it was a barn, burned down 
one time. 
HL: Yeah, accidentally; we don't know how it happened. 
MO: Uh huh. Were you there? I don't know the timing of 
it, 
but was 
that something during your lifetime. 
HL: Yes. This was -- I can't remember now, 
it was 
before the war or after the war, I can't quite recall. 
ML: 
It must have been a real 
inconvenient for you to 
try to run a farm with no barn. I remember the hurricane that 
came that time, remember? Everything was all 
scattered all 
over. 
HL: This was lately, this was not too long ago. 
MO: Yeah. 
ML: Ten years ago. 
HL: Yeah, ten years ago. Yeah, the large door at the 
front end went with the hurricane, and pushed that door in. The 
pressure got in there and 
it couldn't get out, 
they couldn't 
push the other door out. So 
it scattered the blocks all 
over the 
yard. 
MO: Yeah? 
HL: 
It was unbelievable to see the sight. 
That 
night, because 
I saw the cloud over the orchard through the 
windows The whole pace was shaking, 
it was amazing. And I didn't 
have my contacts in, 
and I looked out the bathroom window and 
I 
was saying, "Eddie, something is going on outside" and 
I 
watched my car get all 
this damage to 
it, the paint and 
everything. 
MO: Yeah, Eddie mentioned that. 
HL: Yeah, the roof stayed intact because I had good 
support, steel, four inch pipes and they were belted up with the 
framework. And they remained intact they were a little twisted, 
but -- all I had to do was get a mason contractor to come 
in and 
put new walls, and the roof was put back on, and 
it looked like 
O'Connor--85 Audiocassette logs 
page 89 
a new building. 
MO: Yeah, 
it does -- great. No one would ever know that that 
happened. 
HL: That's right. 
MO: Now what happened during the fire? 
I mean what ... 
HL: Well, I think at the time we only had one horse, 
and we had hogs 
in the back, and I guess the horse managed to 
get out somehow. 
MO: Oh, he didn't die. 
HL: No, he didn't die. 
MR. And you lost the whole building? 
HL: Yeah, completely. There was hay 
in here, and when 
you have hay 
it makes a very hot fire. 
ML: We lost a lot of tools, too, with 
the wood 
handles and so on. 
HL: Yeah, those kind of tools -- the hand tools 
MO: Yeah. 
HL: More things than we remembered —you know how a 
farm can accumulate tools. 
MO: And then you put this other building up right away? 
HL: Yeah, this was after the war when I came back with 
my brothers. 
MO: What were you doing in the war? 
HL: I was a tool maker, making tools and dyes for 
Edward G. Budd, they made bodies for ... 
MO: Oh, so you did that during the war, 
as well. 
HL: Yeah, but it sort of died down because there 
wasn't enough work, they couldn't get enough of this kind of 
work, and the army didn't need all those auto bodies. 
MO: Oh, I see. 
HL: And they weren't tooled up really for other kinds 
of 
... 
MO: Yeah. 
HL: And the farmers were short because 
a lot of the 
young boys had gone into the service and came back and helped 
out. When we expanded, 
in fact, we not only had farmed this 
farm, but we had farmed about 250 acres on the outside, a lot of 
rented ground. We had quite an operation. 
MO: That is a lot of acreage. 
HL: Sure was. 
MO: And you had rented all 
of this? 
HL: All 
rented, yes. 
MO: So what did you do -- gradually buy land 
in this area? 
HL: No, we just stayed here. We never bought -- well, 
we did buy land 
in Escol, yeah, we did buy two parcels there of 
over 200 acres. Yeah, we did. But other land, we did not. We 
just rented. 
MO: And now your acreage is 
right here? 
HL: Right here, 
it's the old homestead. 
It's only 55 
acres. 
MO: Uh huh. Well, 
let me ask you what kinds of tools do you need 
to run a farm like this? 
HL: Today, we don't need as many tools but you have to 
O'Connor--85 Audiocassette logs 
page 90 
and I mean every o 
Ford, every machin 
one that picked it 
MO: No kidding? 
HL: They market a 
Horsepike. And he 
was doing some wor 
farm equipment. So 
He was probably on 
MO: Yeah, right.

after two years, the pate 
nd told them what happene 
short while, and then the 
use it, they couldn't se 
have sophisticated tools. You have to have sprayers that are 
modern, high speed sprayers, tractors that work the ground fast 
-- an entirely different operation 
MO: What did 
it used to be like? What kind of tools did you used 
to use? 
HL: They were all 
hand tools, they 
were all 
horse 
drawn tools before And 
it was very monotonous even 
horses pulling a slow moving equipment 
faster 
ML: 
It was back breaking 
MO: Do you have any of those old tools around? 
HL: No, they eventually all went to the junkyard. 
MO: Uh huh. 
HL: 
It would have 
antiques, but we d 
get rid of 
them because they 
MO: Right, and did 
HL: No, I just hel

MO: So do you own the patent now? 
HL: Well, 
it's expired now, 
it's only for 17 years. 
MO: Oh, I see. 
HL: 
I'd have to renew it. But I figure there's no 
point in renewing it because industry wouldn't pick it up. 
MO: Yeah, I see what you mean. I should say I'm looking at a 
plaque and a framed citation, a letter that talks about all 
of 
your many successes. Gosh, that's great. 
Maybe later on I can 
just read this aloud or something. 
HL: Okay.

HL: Yes. 
MO: For successful achievement in the 
in field of agriculture, 
presented by the Atlantic County Board of Agriculture, February

MO: Of what? 
HL: The Atlantic County Board. 
MO: The Atlantic County Board, yes 
HL: They help us make many things, 
organization work 
and help us with things we need. 
MO: Do they help you, say, 
if you wanted to 
invest in 
new 
machinery or something? 
HL: Oh no, not financially, no. 
In help -- steering us 
in what to do and how to cope with the better methods. 
MO: Yeah, 
information. 
HL: More or less. 
MO: Uh huh. And 
is this many different kinds of farmers that 
belong to this, or 
is this primarily --
HL: The whole area, 
it wouldn't be Atlantic County, it 
would be the whole county here, with Atlantic City. 
MO: Yeah? It would include blueberry and cranberry farmers, as 
well? 
HL: All farmers. 
MO: Fantastic. 
HL: Vegetables, blueberries, whatever. 
MO: That's very nice. So you must have been really proud to 
receive that. 
HL: Oh, 
it was a thrill, really. 
MO: Yeah. Well, 
it seems like you earned it, I mean, judging 
from this statement here. 
ML: 
It's the community helping a lot 
of the farmers 
all 
the time. Helps them out a lot. 
MO: That's really something. So you're 
not about to retire, 
huh? 
HL: 
I'd like to, but I can't, I really can't. Nobody 
wants to pick up the farm. Farming isn't that great these days. 
MO: This 
is what I hear. And I hear it's also very expensive to 
start up something like this, too. 
HL: That's right, 
it 
is very expensive 
a young man to 
start out. 
It takes a lot of capital 
investment the land is one 
O'Connor--85 Audiocassette logs 
page 92 
the buildings , the equipment and operating 
capital. 
ML: Then you still have to wait for your crop. 
MO: Yeah. 
HL: Right, farmers are going through a rough period. I 
never was as deep 
in debt as I am now. 
MO: Really? 
HL: Really. 
MO: You'd think 
it would be the other way around. 
HL: That's right, 
it's very disappointing. 
MO: And do you see any --
HL: I don't know what hope there is. Every farmer that 
is producing higher yields, they're trying cover his expense. 
And 
in doing this you're over—producing. 
MO: Uh huh. Do you think you're going to saturate the market? 
HL: That's right. 
MO: 
Is that what you're worried about? 
HL: Yeah. 
MO: Kind of what happened with the other crops, I guess. 
HL: Well, 
if you don't get enough returns, you can't 
pay your bills, this 
is the problem. 
MO: Right. That's not very complicated ideal wise, 
is 
it? No. 
ML: And 
if you don't have enough land for the crops, 
you can't borrow money against it. 
MO: Oh, really? 
HL: That's right. And this Pinelands situation that we 
got into, 
it's giving us a rough time because our land don't 
have the proper value for the banks would say your land doesn't 
have enough land value to borrow the amount of money you'd 
like to have. 
MO: 
It doesn't? Why doesn't it have that value? 
HL: Because it's in the Pinelands The only land you 
can build on, that has high value. Twice or three times, 
whatever. Whatever the location is. 
MO: Uh huh -- so it's not so much that you would have to build, 
but that you could build right? 
HL: Right. 
In fact, just before the 
Pinelands came 
through, some land developers were working in 
37 
this area, 
and they wanted to build a new settlement down 
in this area 
here, just north of me here and I was involved 
in 
it, 
also. I 
would've let two—thirds of the land go, so 
I got relieved. I 
was near retirement age. 
MO: Two— thirds of your 55 acres? 
HL: Right, I let two—thirds go. I maybe keep 10 or 15, 
and just coast along with that, and then I'd have some savings. 
MO: 
It must have been really frustrating for you. 
HL: Yeah, 
it didn't work at all. 
Two different land 
developers were in here, and I had contracts with both of them, 
and 
it didn't work. 
ML: They were nice contractors, they weren't people 
who were trying to overpopulate the area. 
HL: They were making like a new settlement, they were 
going to have their own sewer system and everything. Self 
controlled development. 
O'Connor--85 Audiocassette logs 
page 93 
M0: Uh huh. 
ML: 
It'd probably be an upper class development, 
mostly. 
HL: Yes. 
ML: Mostly with a lot of space and maintenance, they 
wouldn't be trying to push everybody around You know, 
it wouldn't 
disturb the area 
HL: Because it has nice homes, and 38 the pattern was 
going to be similar to the type of homes 
we have here. 
MO: Uh huh. So you felt it was the kind of development you could 
live with? 
HL: Yes. The fact that we had all 
the sketches and all 
the paperwork, we spent a lot of money on this, I don't know how 
many thousands of dollars we spent doing this And they showed us 
that this was all mapped 
out, the white section had all these 
curved streets, nice looking streets. And they had a name on 
it 
that would fit the orchards, but I forget what it was. I can't 
remember the name now. I still probably have it 
in the safe the 
contract 
MO: 
It's funny how those things --
ML: But they wanted to pull 
all 
the way back to 
Wharton State Park. 
HL: Yes. A little more than a mill Mike Mayer owned 
over 300 acres, and he 
let it all 
go. So I was right next to him 
and the 500 acres was what they were after. And they picked up 
that much , they were working on 
it 
they spent a lot of time 
out there measuring and this and 
that, and surveying. 
MO: Uh huh. 
HL: The first thing, the town wouldn't 
accept it. 
Then the Pinelands come 
in and killed it all 
together 
MO: Why didn't the town want it? 
HL: I don't know, they said it was going to add more 
work for its police department and stuff like that. But it was 
tax revenue, so I don't know why they felt that way. All those 
new homes, there would have --
MO: Plenty of money coming in? 
HL: Sure. 
ML: And give people 
in town a place to 
live. Where 
are you going to go? There's hardly any place left in town to 
move to. 
HL: We can't build there. You can only build one hoe 
on 29 acres. Well, I couldn't build another home here. I mean, 
only for family use. Like one of my children were to build a 
farm with me, I could build a home for them. 
ML: But if you wanted one for yourself say, a smaller 
one, 
if 
you wanted to maintain a whole place by yourself, you 
couldn't really do 
it. Before the land was sold, I mean. You'd 
have to get revenue for it. 
HL: Yeah. I couldn't subdivide because there isn't two 
29 acres here, there's only 55, see. 
MO: Just short by 3 acres, right? 
ML: 
It'd have to be after everything went through, 
then he would have to rebut' 
it again and 
it would probably be 
O'Connor--85 Audiocassette logs 
page 94 
at a higher cost. 
MO: Yeah. 
ML: Which is a shame. 
MO: Yeah. 
ML: This house is a very big house to maintain. 
MO: Yeah, 
it must be -- the three of you live here? 
HL: Yeah, that's all. 
MO: And there were 15 or something at one point? 
HL: Well, not quite. 
ML: 
In the summer the kids came here. 
The relatives' 
kids. 
HL: Yeah. 
MO: But there are 15 rooms. 
ML: Yes. 
MO: That's a lot. What do you do, close off part of 
it for the 
winter? 
HL: Well, for the heat, yes. 
ML: Which we don't use. 
HL: We just cut it off. Thing about the hot water 
heaters, when you cut them off, they don't cut off 100 percent. 
They have a safety valve on them, 
there's a certain amount that 
goes through so they won't freeze. Of course, 
if you cut them 
off they would freeze. 
MO: And then -- oh, I know. 
So you actually have invented more 
than one 
in here? 
You invented the four row planter, and --
these things 
over here? 
HL: Well, I wouldn't call that an 
invention, 
it's 
only a multiple tool. But I was aggressive 
and thick 
in the 
find to find easy ways to get things done 
MO: So how did the vine lifting attachment actually come about? 
HL: Well, these beaters are just like 
the things you 
see on the highway or something, that cuts 
the grass They're 
like a flare type grass beater, see And 
they're used to take 
the vines off the crop before you 
harvest them, because the 
vines are a nuisance, they get 
in the way. You can get the 
vines off, 
like potatoes or 
any kind, they're easy to get out 
and sell, with the vines out of the way. Now, the standard 
beater wouldn't clean all 
of the vines off, because if you tried 
to clean more than -- I mean, as much as you'd like to, you'd 
start hitting the crop itself, because the crops grow in hills 
MO: Yeah, right. 
HL: And they stick out of the ground. 
MO: Uh huh. 
HL: So four big prongs go 
in the back, and they lift 
the vines off 
into the beater. The beater is far away from the 
crop. 
MO: Uh huh. 
HL: There's a lot of space there, for safety And 
it 
shreds the vine 100 percent. 
MO: Oh, I see. And was 
it a blade that did the shredding? 
HL: Well, the flares shred it. And 
these prongs, 
these long, I would say points, you know, they go 
in the ground 
O'Connor--85 Audiocassette logs 
page 95 
about an 
inch and 
it picks all 
the vines up, and picks them up 
into the beater, there's no damage at all 
to the crop, and 
it's 
100 percent of the job. 
MO: Great. 
HL: So when the field man saw that, 
he said, we 
fooled around down south, because they grow a lot of sweet 
potatoes down south, and he says they didn't get nowhere, they 
gave 
it up. And he says he comes up here and sees we have 
it. He 
said, "We were fooling around 
in the front of the beater trying 
to find some way to get these vines up." 
When you do that, you 
can cut out the back. If you cut around the back, the vines don't 
get in the way. 
MO: And 
is this part of a bigger -- is 
it attached to another --
HL: 
It's attached to a beater, you can attach it to a 
beater. 
MO: I guess I'm not sure what a beater is, I guess that's my 
problem. 
HL: Well, 
it's like a great big lawn mower. 
MO: Oh, right, I get the general 
idea. 
HL: 
It'll beat two rows at a time, so 
it's a big 
heavy thing, this beater. 
MO: Uh huh. 
HL: And this attachment weighs over 
400 pounds. It 
has to be big and strong to 
lift all 
of the vines because these 
vines are all 
rooted to the soil. They have all 
little roots. 
MO: Are people using them around here? 
HL: Oh sure, every farmer has one. 
MO: You don't have one yourself, do you? 
HL: No, I don't -- mine was sold a long time ago. 
MO: 
I'd like to go 
look around and see one. I don't see one 
the re . 
ML: Does Carmen have one? 
HL: They got one, yeah. My son 
in 
law has one. They're 
only used when they harvest the sweet potatoes. A day or two 
before, they go and they clean out so many acres and they come 
back and harvest them. And then the tubers come out and --
MO: Fabulous, 
it saves them a lot of work. 
HL: Right. 
MO: Great. Well, have all 
of the farms along this road been 
owned by the same families as 
long as you've been here, more or 
less? 
HL: Yes, most of them. Some of them 
44 
are deceased 
and some of the others had to come and buy them because there was 
no family left to continue the operation 
MO: They seem mostly Italian families. 
HL: Yeah, they were Italian immigrants that really 
built this area. I suppose there were land developers at that 
time, that's why they sold all 
of these little lots, of 
15 
acres, 10 acres. 
ML: That's not a little lot. 
HL: But for a family farm, that was enough. There was 
no machinery, you know, there were just horse drawn implements and 
O'Connor--85 Audiocassette logs 
page 96 
hand tools. That was a lot of 
land. 
MO: Yeah. 
HL: For one family. 
MO: The people are from the same area in 
Italy? 
HL: Yes, Hamilton is. Yeah, Hamilton is a Sicilian 
bunch of people. My dad was not, but it 
is a Sicilian group. 
MO: And how about your own family? 
HL: They came from the east side of Italy, halfway up 
the country. On the east side. 
MO: Do you think that most of the people on the road are 
Sicilian families? 
HL: Yes, they admitted they are. 
In fact, 
in Hamilton, 
there 
is a street names Mesina Avenue, 
which is a city 
in 
Sicily. 
MO: : That's great. 
HL: Yeah, my dad was from the north. 
MO: Do you know why they ended up here or 
how they ended up 
here? 
HL: Well, 
in Europe, and I guess in 
pretty near all 
the countries, they all 
have to serve their 
time 
in the 
service, all 
the young men And I know Italy had 
to. But every 
young man that was eligible, physically eligible he has to serve 
4 years or whatever it 
is, I don't know. 
But when he finished his time, he saw no future there. 
Because 
they had 
large families and they lived up 
in not a very good 
area, probably a mountainous area, and there was no future there. 
So, with the little money he got together from the service, he 
got on a boat and came here. And he was single. 
MO: Uh huh. 
HL: He worked in south Philadelphia, there were all 
farms, there is a stadium that's down there, all 
that between 
the city and the Navy yard there was a whole section there that 
was all farms 
MO: Uh huh. 
HL: And my father lived 
in Philadelphia and he walked 
down there to these farms every day. He soon had enough money to 
buy a lot here, he bought a 20 acre vineyard. 
MO: How old was he? 
HL: Oh, he was quite young. He would 
have been 27 or 
28 years old, he was a young man. 
MO: When he bought that lot. 
HL: He was very ambitious and he worked hard. 
MO: Well, 
it sounds like 
it. So he passed it on to you and now 
you're passing it on to Eddie is that how it's been? 
HL: Well, I hope to, yes. 
MO: Uh huh. And so, Eddie was telling me that the major kind of 
equity is the land itself that you have to pass on, that the 
farmers don't make that much profit, but they have the land. 
HL: Yeah. You see, the land 
is 
so much in debt, that 
the situation is not very good on the farms. We keep borrowing 
money and we have the weather that bothers us, with short crops. 
This has been happening to us the third year, that we're getting 
O'Connor--65 Audiocassette logs 
page 97 
a short crop on peaches. 
MO: Uh huh. 
HL: I don't know why it's happened, 
I don't know 
whether nature is changing or what it 
is. 
And we can't meet our 
obligations, and we get deeper in debt. Now we've got a couple 
of good normal years, and we'll come out of 
it. 
MO: So I guess the new refrigerated 
building will help you, 
won't it? 
HL: Well, that's a must, to try to make some money 
because we can't dispose of all this 
crop at the time we pick 
them, we have to hold them back. 
MO:Uh huh. 
HL: Because so many of the other farms are doing the 
same thing. And by holding them back we make money. And we 
almost double the value of the crop by holding them. 
MO: No kidding? 
HL: Yeah. 
MO: What I heard from Eddie was that since you're the last 
geographical area to grow peaches in the fall. 
HL: Yes. 
MO: Holding them back means you can get a better price. 
Is that 
the main --
HL: Right, we hold them back two or 
three weeks. All 
the farms that have no refrigeration, they all sold out. There 
is 
no stock. 
MO: Then you're truly the last. 
HL: Yeah. 
MO: But everybody 
is 
refrigerated around here, aren't they? 
HL: Yes, all 
the large growers are. 
MO: Can I ask you a couple of questions about some of the other 
farms on the street? 
HL: Yeah, sure. 
MO: I passed one that looked pretty big -- Rusty Luca? 
HL: Yeah, and he's quite new. Now that 
was an old 
established farm, Rosotti had 
it. 
MO: Yeah, I saw his name, Rosotti on it 
HL: The man was 
in his eighties so he gave 
it up. Sold 
it to Joe Luca, and Rusty 
is his son. 
Father is 
in the broker 
business, he's a broker. 
MO: Uh huh, and 
is that a big operation? 
HL: Not too big, but it's quite new. I wouldn't say it 
was that big, probably bigger than mine though. 
Much bigger 
than mine, but not that big --
Now up near the pike, that's a big operation. He has a sign near 
the corner there Demarco? 
MO: Yes, I saw it. 
HL: The Demarco Orchards, now he has a big operation 
-- that's all 
peaches. 
MO: Uh huh. 
HL: And he's quite new. 
MO: Oh, really? 
HL: Yeah, he's quite new. That orchard goes way back 
O'Connor--85 Audiocassette logs 
page 98 
to Parkers, which was way back before my time 
they had peaches 
the re . 
MO: Oh, really? Parkers? 
HL: Parkers. 
MO: Parkers 
HL: Parkers, yeah. 
MO: Uh huh. 
HL: 
In fact, there was an article in 
the paper last 
week. A whole story about the Parkers. 
MO: The Atlantic Press? 
HL: No, the Hamilton paper. 
MO: The Hamilton paper. 
HL: Yeah. 
MO: Oh great, I'll 
take a look at 
it before I go. 
HL: You know, as a little boy, I remember the Parkers 
having a nice orchard right there on the corner where the 
orchard is now. 
MO: So Parkers was the first one on Pine Road then? 
HL: 
It's really on the pike. But Pine Road is a side 
street. It could be 
in 
last week's issue, 
Mary. 
MO: How are you holding up time wise? 
Am I boring you yet? 
HL: No, I'm okay. I was irrigating. 
I'm free now 
though. 
MO: Okay, great, because I don't want to take up too much of 
your time. 
HL: No, 
it's okay. 
MO: This is pretty interesting, I'd 
like to continue. 
HL: No, 
it's okay. No, We're fine. 
MO: What is a traveling winch? 
HL: 
Oh. Are from...

MO: 
I'm trying to get a picture of the whole -- 
it seems 
like the whole road 
is a farming road, right? 
Pine Road? 
HL: Yes, uh huh -- all 
of 
it. Yes. 
MO: So did these people move on to Pine Road pretty much at the 
same time, the original farmers? 
HL: I would think so. Yeah, I would think so. 
MO: 
Because when I was talking with the Putiri's down there at 
Emma's Market down there, they thought that Pine Road really had 
most of the old farms in the 
area. 
HL: Right, there were very good farms on Pine Road. 
MO: Uh huh -- do you remember the names of people that own them? I 
know you mentioned Rasotti. 
HL: Rasotti. There were two brothers, where Luca is now, that was 
Peter Rasotti, and the one across the street from new now, the old 
homestead is still there, there was a John Rasotti, they were 
brothers --
MO: Oh, I see. 
HL: And another brother, Agulci Fruit on 206, a beautiful place, a 
beautiful farm there, that was another brother, named Rasotti. 
MO: Oh, I see, they had a lot of farms. 
HL: And I knew their father. 
MO: Oh? 
HL: Yeah, I knew their father; he was real old and I knew him. 
MO: How about -- what other families along 
Pine Road for example, 
do you remember? 
HL: Well, Presti across the street on the corner, Presti. 
MO: That's still there, right? 
HL: That's still there, yeah, right. Now the man that gave me all 
the information was Charles Finning, a German name. There used to 
be some red barns behind the house there, 
it's just this side of 
Crusty Luco (names of places are phonetic) 
MO:. Right, I saw that. Now is he still there? 
HL: No, he passed away. He was quite old and he told me all 
about 
the old history here. 
MO: Oh, what did he tell you? 
O'Connor--85 Audiocassette logs 
page 100 
HL: Oh, he told me the early part, you know -- I can't remember 
now, I wish I had spent more time with him. I enjoyed his 
histories. Yeah I like to hear about old history. 
MO: Yeah, me, 
too. After the Finnings were gone -- who's in there 
now, 
in their place? 
HL: Oh, he's related to the brewery, the Hamilton Brewery. Right 
now he has a little business there. 
MO: Oh, 
is that Tula? 
HL: Tula, yes, Tula. Get the book for him, Mary, please. Thank 
you. Here it 
is. They're Mexicans, you know. I let them take care 
of all that. 
MO: That's smart. 
HL: They appreciate it, 
and they do a good job, they don't cheat. 
I know what time they start in the morning and I know what time 
they quit at night. 
They can't. 
MO: Right, but that's very smart of you to do that, to give them 
their own sense of responsibility 
HL: Yes, uh huh. 
MO: Anyway, so basically it was the Rasottis and Finning and 
Pressa? 
HL: Presti. 
MO: Oh, Presti, I'm sorry -- and you? 
HL: Yeah. There was Tomasellos. There were a couple of Tomasellos 
along the road, there was a white house on the left side, 
it's got 
a cinderblock building in the back, that was Tomasello. In fact, 
there was a couple of Tomasellos. The one Tomasello was -- there's 
a monument the where the feast of Mt. Carmel began. 
MO: I meant to ask you about that. 
ML: Oh, the day we came outside, there was a procession coming 
down the street. 
MO: Really? How did that come about? 
HL: Oh, Carmel 
is a saint that certain Italian people are 
devoted to this saint, and they had this practice in 
Italy, and 
the ones that came who were immigrant they started it, 
they 
started it here. Now the church in town, the main church is, 
that's their patron saint, see 
MO: And they also do --
HL: And 
it started right here. 
In other words, there was no church 
in Hamilton -- there were all families; the Tomasellos and the 
Rasottis and they all started right here, and they started in a 
home -- 
it was an annual feast. On the 16th of July, that's the 
date 
MO: And do they have processions now, too 
HL: Yes, 
in town, yes, they have a big, 
long procession in town, 
yeah. 
It was only along, I guess along Pine Road at the time. I 
wasn't here when they first started that. 
MO: So that was before they even had a church in town. 
HL: Yeah, before they even had a church here. 
ML: This was the main street of the town before --
HL: Yeah, this was the main drag. There was supposed to have been 
a hotel and ... 
MO: Oh, so Whitehouse Pike made the big change? 
HL: Yes I remember when Whitehouse Pike was a dirt road, I 
O'Connor--85 Audiocassette logs 
page 101 
remember when 
it was all 
dirt roads and horse and wagons used to 
go down here and some of the fire trucks would go to Atlantic 
City, and they were really relics. But they'd go put, put, they'd 
be going down that road. 
MO: Well, that was about as fast as you moved in those days, 
right? 
HL: That's right. 
MO: Boy, that's amazing when you think about that. 
ML: This street used to have trees all 
along here. 
HL: Oh yes, the street here that goes south, there was all 
chestnuts. But some kind of blight came 
in one year and killed all 
the trees. But I remember when I was a kid, there were chestnuts 
all 
over the ground, and we used to --
ML: We used to have chestnut trees over here, too. 
HL: Yeah, well, there are different varieties. 
ML: Yeah. 
HL: But they were like shade trees, big, massive shade trees. 
MO: So, Pine Road was the main drag. And then 
is this Union out 
here? 
HL: This 
is Union, yeah. 
MO: 
Was this like a big crossroads, on Union? 
HL: I would say so, because it's a continuation of -- by the 
cemetery, and you go down here on Union Road to Columbia Road. 
Columbia Road is a county road now, see. 
MO:. So that's the same path that the stage used to go on. 
HL: Yeah, this way goes out to Flemton Pike, on the other side of 
the bridge, and then it comes out there. 
MO: Uh huh. 
HL: But this was quite a little hub here. But Pine Road just comes 
to a dead end, 
it's a dead end, I mean there's no crossing on the 
pike. Here it's a dead end, 
it's only two miles long. 
MO: 
It's funny because it would be difficult to know that. You 
know, 
if I hadn't bumped into you guys ... 
ML: What's that other road that went into the woods, that goes 
back by the blueberries back there, that goes to Iron Mills? What 
was the name of that, off of Myrtle Street? 
HL: Oh, Myrtle Street? Oh, that was like a village up here. 
ML: That's what I was talking about. 
HL: Yeah, there were a lot of homes there.But there's West Mills 
Road and Myrtle Street, and they were supposed to put a railroad 
station on the central 
line because they could have used another 
station up there because there were a lot of homes up here, a lot 
of 
little farms up here. There's not now, there are no homes at 
all 
now, there's none. None at all. 
MO: Gosh, all 
gone, eh? 
HL: What's up there now 
is Tuckahoe Turf, a turf farm. Must be 
over a couple hundred acres -- beautiful green. 
MO: 
I'll have to go down there. 
HL: Did you see that area yet? 
MO: Not yet, Mary 
is going to take me. 
ML: Big irrigation system there. 
HL: Oh, the whole thing is --
MO: Big Pike, eh? 
O'Connor--85 Audiocassette logs 
page 102 
HL: When I was young, there was just a little trail there that I 
used to go by wagon. 
(SIMULTANEOUS TALKING) 
ML: You should see 
it, 
it's massive.I take a lot of pictures back 
the re . 
MO: Oh yeah? I'd like some -- 
if we get a chance I'd 
love to 
look 
at some of your pictures of this place or that place. 
ML: Oh, I have a lot of them. 
MO: 
If you don't mind, because I'm supposed to take some. 
HL: You know, we didn't realize -- we had pictures of the old 
bakery shop with the names on 
it. 
MO: Yeah? 
HL: And Crezenzo Bakers, Crezenzo was the owner. 
MO: Oh, before 
HL: Yeah. 
ML: I have a picture of that lady whose father built that. 
HL: Yeah. 
ML: Remember when she came around, a long time ago? 
HL: Yeah, she's old now, and her father --
ML: Oh, she's well over 100. 
HL: And Mr. Crezenzo, he was a real sleepy man, he never worked. 
He was like a businessman, he was running a saloon here and a 
bakery shop, had a long white beard ... 
MO: Do you have any pictures of him? 
HL: No, 
it's a shame, we don't. 
ML: We can go through ours and see. You never know. 
HL: We had a picture of a house, the house had a balcony on the 
second f 
l 
oor. 
MO: Wow. 
ML: Oh yeah, 
it did. Fancy. 
HL: Oh yeah, fancy posts with a vectra(?) front. 
ML: Well, how about the picture they too with the bricks, the 
bricks they put in the back of that magazine? 
HL: I don't know where it 
is. 
ML: The Saturday Evening Post. 
HL: Yeah, the Saturday Evening Post, when that was popular, the 
Plymouth car, when it first came out with the four wheel brakes, 
was 
it, 
or the hydraulic brakes or whatever it was, 
it was 
something new. And they took a picture of the mailbox here. The 
mailman putting the mail 
in the box, and they took a picture of 
his car and he himself, and a couple of the people out there 
That was on the cover of the Saturday Evening Post Magazine. 
MO: Oh gee, 
if you folks can find any of these pictures, I would 
love to make copies of them. 
ML: I have a sister—in—law who keeps things like that, I can ask 
her. Did she take that suitcase of old pictures? She's going to put 
them all 
together one day. 
HL: I don't know -- she might have something. 
ML: Yeah, because I gave her a lot of stuff because I didn't want 
it to rot, and I certainly don't know who's who 
MO: Well, I'm going to probably come back 
in a few days and you 
O'Connor--85 Audiocassette logs 
page 103 
know, so 
if you get a chance to talk her about it, 
that'd be great. 
ML: She's 
in the greenhouse now. 
MR. Well, I don't want to 
interrupt her now. 
HL: No, she's not in the greenhouse so much until the season is 
over. She's only there then. 
(PHONE INTERRUPTION, CUT) 
ML: -- when they stake the orchard out. 
MO: And you have pictures of all this? 
ML: Everything. 
MO: Would it be possible for me to make copies of some of those? 
ML: Sure, but you've got to go through them. 
MO: Oh, I don't mind spending the time. 
ML: See, the problem is, 
see, I dump them as soon as I get them, 
because I go through -- like ten carousel trays are not enough for 
me at this point, because we're going through two or three rolls a 
week. 
MO: Wow. Well, I don't spending the time looking through them. 
ML: Well, you can go through them if you like; I have quite a few 
good ones and some bad ones. I have a lot of pictures of him out 
the re 
MO: Great 
ML: Out on the tractor. 
MO. Great. 
HL: We have some huge slides of the pond. 
ML: Gee, I never saw those, those are the older pictures, 
probably. 
HL: We had some beautiful slides. 
MO: He has them now? 
ML: Yeah; he probably has them all 
classified and everything. 
MO: Oh, 
I'd love to see them -- that'd be great. 
HL: Yeah, 
in the service, see, he learned a little photography, 
and he did a nice job. 
ML: Yeah, he takes good pictures. 
MO. Where 
is he? 
HL: He lives 
in town, he's a junior, he's Hugh Jr. 
MO: Oh, I see. Oh, 
I'd definitely like to 
see them. Could I get 
in touch with him, would that be all 
right? 
HL: I guess so. He has some beautiful slides, orchards when the 
fruit is 
in bloom, when the fruit is hanging, the tomato fields, 
the beautiful rows of bascus. It's a pretty, pretty sight. 
ML: Yeah, see, you never see that many bascus any more. 
MR. Yeah, I wanted to — it'd be great because I know there's 
a big transition. 
MR. Yeah. And they're not used any more. 
ML: No. 
HL: They use bulk bins. Or we use bulk bins to haul the fruit in 
from the orchard. 
MO: Yeah, I heard that was quite a big transition. 
HL: Yes -- because there's no stacking, 
like that; they pick and 
dump the product right in the bin, you know, carefully -- surveys 
show it's less bruising that way 
if 
it's done right. 
MO: You know, I didn't get to talk to Eddie about this part, we 
O'Connor--85 Audiocassette logs 
page 104 
talked about some things about soil 
and planting and stuff, but we 
didn't talk about picking 
HL: Oh? 
MO:. How does the picking actually take place, and when? 
HL: Well, we pick when the fruit is properly 
matured for 
shipping, 
it's got to be ripe, firm for shipping. That's why you 
can use a bulk bin. The men have straps on their shoulders and 
they hold out a plastic bucket or a plastic basket, whatever you 
want to call 
it, 
and they fill 
it up and go back and pick and so 
on. 
MO: By hand they pick? 
HL: Yeah, 
it's all 
done by hand, yes. 
MO: From the ground. 
HL: From the ground and ladders 
MO: And ladders, too? 
HL: Tall tree ladders. 
MO: So you got to have a lot of ladders. 
HL: Well, we have 12 trees, we don't use too many -- we only have 
about ten ladders. 
MO: Are those the ones that taper? 
HL: : Yeah, taper. That's it. They're like a three legged affair. 
They stay quite stable when you stand on them, see. 
MO: Oh, I see, 
I'll 
have to take a look at 
it. 
HL: Yeah, they're quite stable. They're light and strong — 
aluminum. 
MO: Oh, they are? They're not made out of wood? 
HL: No, we would never use wood, they get so shabby after awhile 
We've had the aluminum ones about ten years and they look brand 
new. They're expensive, but in the long run they,re cheaper. 
MO: Uh huh. 
HL: Then the bulk bins, they're brought in 
by the packing house, 
and the forklift picks the bulk bin and brings it wherever you 
want it, 
in a cooler or stack them near the bin turner. You put 
them in 
the bin turner and the bin turner dumps it very slowly 
the bin turner dumps 
it very slowly 
in the water or whatever 
method we come up with. Here we use water, we dump it 
in the 
water. 
MO: Uh huh. 
HL: And the water is flowed out The pump pumps the water. 
MO: That's interesting. 
MR. Yeah, and no one has to be there, see 
MR. Right I forgot about that, that's pretty amazing, yeah. 
ML: We sprung a leak. 
MO: Where? 
ML: You lose a whole gallon of paint. 
(INAUDIBLE) 
HL: He's got a problem with the compressor 
ML: No, 
it's--
(INAUDIBLE) 
HL: The safety valve on there is not working. 
ML: Yeah, but that shouldn't do that. 
O'Connor--85 Audiocassette logs 
page 105 
HL: Well, 
if 
it's dripping paint, that's different. 
ML: He's all upset. 
HL: Yeah, I know he was looking all 
around to match the paint 
and everything else. 
ML: Oh yes. 
MO: Some things seem like they're endless even though they're 
little things. 
ML: Oh, endless, that's for sure. 
HL: Now what else can we talk about? 
MO: Oh, I wanted to ask about the baskets. Before the bins came 
in, 
how did you go about dealing with the fruit? 
HL: Well, we picked 
in baskets and we lined them up alongside of a 
roadway or a truck or a trailer or whatever we used to 
load on, 
and after they're picked or 
in the process of picking, we'd have 
to stack them and we'd be 
like treating one basket like four so 
one 
is 
inside the other, and 
it was really and endless job. 
MO: Yeah. 
HL: The bulk bin eliminates all this. 
In bulk bins, you can stack 
them on top of the other and the fruit don't touch each other. 
MO: Yeah, that's great. 
HL: There's space between each one. 
MO: Yeah, sounds like it makes a lot of sense. 
HL: And once they're 
in there, you don't have to handle them no 
more. The forklift does everything. The bin turner dumps it, 
and 
MO: And 
it dumps it without bruising? 
MR. Oh yes, 
it dumps 
it nicely without bruising. Better than by 
hand, 
it's foolproof. 
MO: Boy. 
HL: Oh yeah, surveys show the bulk bin 
is perfect if done right. 
MO: That's fabulous So what does, say 
year in the life of a 
farmer look like? Like, when do you start working and ... 
HL: You mean our season? 
MO: Yeah, what is the whole season? 
HL: 
It's almost 100 percent year round, 
it changes because we 
don't have the same pressure 
in the winter; 
in the winter we have 
to do our pruning, maintaining our summer equipment, repairing, 
you know, there's something to do all 
the time. And we don't have 
help, we just have ourselves or a key man to help us, that's all. 
And as soon as the weather breaks, and the pruning 
has to be completed, and the spray program begins. As soon 
as any -- soon as 
life forms on a tree you've got to start 
protecting it. Even dormant, before any buds come out. Protection 
has to be prepared to prevent infection and whatever. 
MO: Uh huh, and when 
is that done 
what month would that be? 
HL: That starts in April. 
MO: I see. 
HL: : Yeah, about the first of April. And as spring goes on, 
there's a limit, there's so many days before harvest -- 30 days or 
15 days, whatever the product you're using, the chemical you're 
using has a tolerance period. 
You have to obey the tolerance. 
MO: Right Otherwise, 
it can infect the fruit. 
O'Connor--85 Audiocassette logs 
page 106 
HL: Well, you can have some poisons on the fruit, and that's 
the fruit, and that's a no no. You know, we have to be 
very careful 
in our use of pesticide and insecticide. We 
have to be a registered applicator. 
MO: Oh really? 
HL: Yes, we carry a license just like a driver's license. 
MO: That says you're allowed to use the chemical you use? 
HL: Yeah, and we can't do 
it unless we have it. You can't purchase 
it and you can't use 
it unless you're really classified as an 
operator. 
MO: Uh huh. 
HL: We had to take a little short course on that. 
MO: Yeah, I'm sure. So you spray 
in April?.— 
HL: We start in April and then about every two weeks — — we keep 
something on the tree all 
the time for protection, for fungus, 
insects. 
MO: Uh huh. 
HL: Up to the tolerance date and then we get it off. 
MO: Uh huh -- then what is the next step? 
HL: Oh, we harvest. There 
is no spraying in the fall, very little. 
Things have to be done by then. There 
is one particular spray, we 
spray for the bores that bore the tree, we spray that in the fall 
and try to control some of that. 
MO: Uh huh, so from April to July 
is harvest. 
HL: We start in July, the varieties ripen at different stages in 
time. 
MO: Oh? How many varieties of peaches do you have? 
HL: About ten, 8 or 10. 
MO: Oh, I didn't know there were that many. 
HL: Yes, and we try to keep every week, another variety, so you 
can't have them all 
at once. 
MO: Uh huh. 
HL: But we try to keep the biggest harvest the last week of 
harvest, that's when we want to hold over. 
MO: Right, I get it. So from April to July, you're preparing. 
HL: 
That's right. 
MO: Making sure nothing hurts it. 
HL: Yeah, the fruit now is only that big and it's green, grass 
green, and so we have to keep it clean and protect it. 
MO: Then what happens after? Harvest goes until when? 
HL: The first of September. 
MO: Oh? And that's when you have your crews working, the Mexicans? 
HL: Yes, yes. 
MR. How many do you have working there during harvest? 
HL: About 10, 
that's all I have here. Plus a few in the packing 
house, packing. 
MO: Uh huh. 
HL: 
It's practically all handled by hand because you have to grade 
for quality and bruises, you know, 
MO: Uh huh. Then? 
HL: 
If you 
let machinery do 
it all, 
it won't be a very accurate 
job, so we try and get most of 
it done by hand 
MO: That's interesting. 
O'Connor--85 Audiocassette logs 
page 107 
HL: You can do a lot of the moving, but when.you pick them up, two 
in each hand, you can really see them and it's guaranteed. 
MO: So then once August starts winding down, what happens then? 
HL: We're very busy 
in the last month of August especially between 
the 15th and the first. Sometimes you get a little late season and 
maybe you'll 
run a week 
in September. This year I think we're a 
little early, we're going to be off by the first of September, I'm 
quite sure. 
We had a very warm April this year. 
MO: Yeah. 
HL: And everything was pushed up. 
MO: Yeah -- I noticed the flowers were like that. 
HL: Yeah. 
MO: And then, so 
in September you're done? 
HL: We're done, yeah. 
MO. And what do you do then? 
HL: Well, just clean up the orchards a little bit of broken 
branches and clean the surface trash and all 
that. The grass 
growth and all 
that. Try to make 
it 
look civilized. 
MO. Uh huh, and then you're pretty much set until the next season 
rolls around. 
HL: Yes, that's right. Some farmers, that's why I wanted a 
peach farm, I want to take it easy 
at the end of the season. Some 
farmers, as soon as they get their crop 
in they go away. Take a 
vacation and then wait 'til 
the weather breaks in the spring. 
MO: Where do most of the farmers go 
in the winter time? 
HL: Oh, a lot of them go south, sometimes fishing places, you 
know, the ones that can afford it. 
MO: And what kind of days do you put in while your season 
is 
on, 
though, how many hours a day? 
HL: Oh, endless, endless. Late hours. 
In the morning we start as 
early as we can. I like to work in the cool hours -- during the 
day the fruit gets pretty hot and it's hard to cool down, and we 
have to cool down all that fruit. 
MO: Yeah, I understand. Eddie was talking about the hydro—cooler. 
HL: Oh yeah, you have to pull that heat out of there for their 
shelf life. You can lose shelf life 
if the fruit is not prepared. 
MO: So as you 
look back on your career as a farmer, would you have 
done 
it any other way? 
HL: All I enjoyed was good health, really. The years I was farming 
I did financially pretty well, I thought I did pretty well. 
MO: Uh huh. 
HL: Of course, I was young and when you're young you have a lot of 
ambition, the work 
is easy because you don't get so tired. I used 
to work night and day; 
in fact, even when I was on the farm, I 
worked hard all 
day with the boys out in the field and 
in 
the 
night time. I'd work 
in 
the shop. 
MO: Yeah? 
HL: I can't do that now. Five o'clock at night I head for the house. 
MO: What time do you start? 
HL: I start early six or before. 
MO: Oh my goodness, so that's a 12 hour day. 
HL: Yes. 
MO: That's not bad. Are you still making any tools? 
O'Connor--85 Audiocassette logs 
page 108 
HL: : Not too many now. The last little thing I made, the last 
little thing I made I gave to him to sit. 
MO: Great. 
HL: We go shopping a lot and when you go to the stores, there is 
no place to sit. So he gets tired standing up. 
MO: So he uses that as a walker. 
HL: Yeah, 
it can be used as a walker. And I made this, and he was 
so pleased with it. He can sit in 
it with a little comfort. 
MO: Oh, so 
it's a canvas seat attached to the legs of the walker. 
HL: Yeah, I made the hardware. I also made the tools,the dye and 
whatnot. These are standard clamps. 
MO: Standard clamps and you put the eye bolts through them, and a 
piece of wood. 
HL: Yep. 
MO: Can I try 
it? 
HL: 
It 
is sturdy. 
MO: Yeah, 
it certainly is. 
HL: Sure. 
HL: 
It's nice because all 
he does is unclip it and he can use it 
as a walker and 
it doesn't get in his way. 
MO: Yeah, and you close it and put it 
in the car. I made it a 
little tight. 
MO: Oh, that's great. 
HL: We have a patent on 
it, 
even. 
MO: Oh, 
it 
is patented? 
HL: Yeah, and a patent attorney told us try to sell 
it, don't 
manufacture it yourself. 
MO: Yeah, right. 
HL: So some fidgety person is going to fall down and they're going 
to be 
liable, there will 
be a big suit. 
MO: Right, they'll say that the canvas was slippery or something. 
HL: Yeah, or something. 
MO: Well, I think you've given me something to think about here. 
HL: Thank you.

EL: All 
right, and I'm going to give 
you a tour of the entire 
farm. 
MO: Great. How long does 
it take to 
walk around 55 acres? 
EL: You can spend the day, but we'll 
try to do 
it 
in an hour. Do 
you want to go 
in the house? 
ML: The house is a mess. 
EL: The house is a mess. 
MO: Well, 
let's start --
ML: You could go downstairs, but you 
can't go upstairs. 
EL: Okay. 
ML. Some people made a mess 
in our 
house. I'm going into town. 
MO: We talked about the summer kitchen 
EL: All 
right, so you don't want to 
know about that. 
MO. Other than the fact that you're 
in the middle of renovating 
it, 
right? 
EL: No, but you know all 
the other thing about it, 
right? 
MO: I think we went through it, yeah. 
Maybe we can concentrate 
on the --
EL: Packing? 
MO: The packing and the barns. What 
do you call that 
building,anyway? 
EL: That's the shop. Before I go any 
further I have to just say 
one thing (inaudible). 
(Recording interrupted.) 
MO: This 
is the outside and the hydro-cooler. But I haven't 
taken pictures yet of the (inaudible). 
I'll have to use some 
other film. 
EL: All 
right. So I explain that when 
the peaches come 
in from 
out in the field they come in on 
these boxes that are carried 
in 
by wagon. And there's a forklift that comes up and picks the 
boxes stacks them on the side. And this hydrocooler is filled 
with ice to keep the temperature down to 35 degrees. 
MO: Where does the 
ice go 
in, 
so I've 
got a picture of this. 
EL: Right there. 
MO: 
In the tray on the side. 
EL: Right, the blocks of 
ice they get stacked up 
in there. And 
it 
cools the water down to about 35 degrees. That's a pump. Hold on 
O'Connor--85 Audiocassette logs 
page 110 
a second. This 
is just on the top of 
it. 
MO: 55—gallon drum covering the pump itself. 
EL: 
Right (inaudible). And this 
is the conveyor. It's broken 
right now (inaudible) and sprays out across the top here. 
MO: So it actually sprays the fruit. 
EL: Right, cools the fruit down. And the whole purpose of this 
is 
to keep the pit, keep it as close to 35, 36 degrees as possible 
when 
it comes in. Then put it 
in the cooler. If you were to put 
it 
in 
the refrigeration cooler the way 
it was, right from the 
field, the peaches would never reach that temperature and would 
not last as long 
MO: Did you buy parts for this or did you buy the whole thing or 
did you make it? 
EL: Yeah, we had these units (inaudible) 
units we modified. We 
cut it and raised 
it up. 
It was designed for boxes. It was 
designed for a smaller package going through. 
So all we did was 
cut it 
in half, raised it up and now we can fit bins rather than 
the detached box. 
MO: What are the dimensions of the bins? 
EL: Forty by 48, about 27 to 29 inches high. It's like a pallet 
with a two foot side on 
it. 
MO: So they come out on the house side here, right? Or you just 
put them in this side. 
EL: You put them in from the outside (inaudible). You put them in 
from here and then you would pick them up from (inaudible) side, 
house side. 
MO: And it's kind of a slow operation right? A forklift has to 
come 
in and pick them up or something--
EL: Yeah, well, 
it's not that bad. 
You 
if you have that many 
bins to hydrocool you can just put conveyors. Like, behind you 
there's a set of conveyors.You can just attach that to the front 
of this, you can stack two or three and have them waiting. But --
when you have a backlog. 
MO: (Inaudible.) 
EL: Well, a bin holds 20 boxes. So ten bins would be 200 boxes, 
20 bins. Anywhere between 20 to 25, 30 bins. 
MO: (Inaudible.) 
EL: Yeah, 
it's anywhere between four to six hundred boxes. 
MO: That's a lot of peaches. 
EL: 
It's not 
if 
you have the right equipment. And that's why we 
had to make the change away from everything being manhandled 
through equipment. And you 
need that, you really do. 
If you 
don't have that, you're losing money because (inaudible) 
automation into the packing house as possible. 
MO: So you want to keep your labor in the field pretty much. 
EL: Exactly, yeah. 
MO: Okay. So they come out the other side. Then what happens? 
EL:R. Okay. This is stocked full of 
ice and the temperature is 
down to 35 degrees. And the peaches out. 
Now they're cool. 
The forklift picks them up. 
If you're packing at that particular 
time and you know when your orders are coming in, 
or 
if you have 
the orders in front of you when these peaches are coming out of 
here, you can just pick them up and place them right on a 
O'Connor--85 Audiocassette logs 
page 111 
conveyor here and they'll go right into the packing house. 
If you don't know what the orders are for the day, and you just 
want to take the peaches out and start the refrigeration process, 
you'll pick them up with the forklift, take them up here into the 
ramp and into the cooler. 
Then when you get the orders you can pull them out (inaudible 
But the most important thing is to get that peach 
down to 35, 36 degrees, the pit, and put it away so that it 
stops growing. Because even 
if you just put it away and 
you didn't go to the hydrocooling part of 
it, 
the peach would 
be a little colder, but it would still be growing inside. 
And you actually want to stop 
it. That's hard to do. 
MO: (Inaudible.) So now we're walking up the ramp and we make a 
left turn into the cooler. 
EL: Exactly. The forklift comes in here. And you'll have like 
rows for different varieties, maybe(inaudible) you're picking Red 
Havens and maybe Arbrights and Garnet Beauties you're picking 
three different varieties all 
at one time. So you put them in 
rows, a couple of rows of one variety, a couple of rows of 
another. So you just M 
in here with the forklift and stacking 
these bins up. 
On the opposite side of the cooler, you may have 
the whole thing 
full of packed boxes. In other words one side might be the bins 
and the other side might be boxes that are packed. 
MO: So they are those crates over there that are 12 or 18, 
you 
say? 
EL: Yeah. And you'll have rows of those too, for all different 
sizes and varieties and what have you. 
MO: Now, I don't think I've taped everything you told me about 
building this place (inaudible). 
EL: : Okay. We thought we could save a large portion of the 
money. So we figured on doing it ourself. 
We spent about $60,000 
as opposed to $120,000 if we had some one come in and do it. What 
cost the most money was refrigeration. And that's something that 
we couldn't make. So we had to buy that. And even though we tried 
to buy some used compressors to save money it was still very 
expensive. We would up doing everything except the block work. We 
put the roof on --
MO: (Inaudible.) 
EL: Trusses, plywood, floor. The only thing we didn't do was 
block work. The cooler is very good. 
The fact that it's 
capable of freezing, 
if you had to. You could even use 
it 
in 
the 
wintertime as a freezer for different things like seafood, frozen 
foods. 
MO: What about the size of 
it? Is 
it adequate for your needs or 
something you're going to outgrow in a few years, or --
EL: No. We built it with the 
idea that we were expanding at the 
time, so that's why -- right now it's the perfect size for us. We 
couldn't ask for a better size. At the time we might have 
thought it was too big, when we built it. But we're growing into 
O'Connor--85 Audiocassette logs 
page 112 
it. Someday we may grow out of 
it. 
If we do we'll just put up one 
along side of 
it at the same size. 
MO: What's the insulation material? 
EL: That's urethane. That's what you find in the refrigerators 
and iceboxes, cold boxes. 
MO: : And the fans are for -- ? 
EL: The evaporators. That's where the coolant comes out. It gets 
pretty cold in here. You can't stay around too long. When you're 
putting stuff in, 
it's not too bad, because the door is opening 
and closing all 
the time. We have that break there, so when the 
door 
is open 
so when you're (?)it all 
the time constantly the 
temperature rises a bit. But when you come 
in here at the 
end of the day, this 
is 
like 
in the middle of the night. And 
it's 
like 33 degrees. You can actually feel 
it, 
like you have 
to move around. You can't stand in one place. 
Then you know is working, because the peach is cold. 
You went 
through the hydrocooling system. Now the thing is cold, now the 
thing 
is dead. So now you can play with 
it. 
You can hold it 
if 
you want to. 
MO: Til 
the price 
is right. 
EL: But the other way is, 
the farmers that don't have this 
equipment, that didn't make this change, have to succumb to 
whatever the market price 
is for that day. 
MO: Now, have most farmers made the change? 
EL: Oh, yeah. The ones that didn't are probably the ones that put 
up a tent and pack their peaches by hand. 
MO: Wow, that's hard to compute. 
EL: Yeah, 
it 
is. 
MO: What are the dimensions of this place? 
EL: 30 by 50, 
16 foot high. See, I can go one more bin higher. I 
can go five high if I wanted to, yes. So the room can hold 400 
bins which is approximately 8,000 boxes. So whichever way you 
want to see it, 
it's either 400 of one of those things or 8,000 
of those. I'd 
rather see 8,000 of those all 
packed up and ready 
to go . 
And that's what we try to do. Like when you come 
in here in 
September, you can't move, because the place is full. It's either 
full 
of bins or it's full 
of boxes or it's half full 
of bins and 
half full 
of boxes. There's always like a lot of boxes in here. 
MO: What's the smell? 
EL: 
It smells like peach --
MO: 
It smells good. Do you own a forklift yourself? 
EL: Yeah. That's (?). Some trucks you can load with the forklift. 
Some trucks can't hold a forklift so you load 
it with that. 
That's a G tractor, that's an antique. But it's used 
in 
gardening, 
it' 
like a garden tractor. We use 
it to work 
in 
between the tree with. We plant our cucumbers between trees 
rather than plant them in the wide—open area. This machine here 
is set up 
in such a way that it works well with the trees, 
working --

MO: About four feet wide and a

it's set up for what

EL: Yeah, that's something tha 
something called the G. That's

MO: All 
right. So you have two 
they're bins, 
in the cooler he 
right? How do you keep them co 
EL: They warm up somewhat, but 
little bit. You can have your 
the peaches are dumped into th 
kind of an 
ice—making machine 
kept cold. Or you can keep you 
throwing it 
in 
,the machine. 
So you can kind of do that. Bu

it,s 
August, that's not too hard to

that's 50 degrees, they're not 
they're only going to be passi 
being washed. So when you pack 
actually cold. They feel 
like 
will say, these are cold, they 
MO: Who works on these? 
EL: No, these are -- this would range. 
It would vary from the 
kid going to high school summer vacation or somebody in her 
mid-30s. Usually it's kids from school 
looking for a summer job. 
We try to train them, we have to do certain things that way. And 
we try to keep the people out in the field because they become 
proficient in that.

we're doing

If they're coming out of

going to warm up that much because

them on the table, they're 
cubes of 
ice. Sometimes the girls 
're making my hands cold 
I really don't believe that you have to have the same people out 
in the field 
in the packing house, because one person has to 
learn how to d something right and the other person has to 
learn 
how to do something right, too. And I really doubt very much 
if 
hose two people can do the same things back and forth. 
MO: (Inaudible) labor. Well, 
let's 
start at the beginning. We're 
in the packing house. 
EL: All 
right, we're 
in the packing house. Once again, the 
forklift is used to take the bins out of the cooler. And he'll 
just come 
in and turn around the put that one 
in and set two 
more. 
MO: On the conveyor there? 
EL: Yeah. And that will come up and 
the 
the re . 
MO: Oh, I see; this 
is a bin lifter? 
EL: Yeah. That's what you've been talking about. That would just 
peaches will drop in 
O'Connor--85 Audiocassette logs 
page 114 
turn over and the peaches would fall through this door. We can 
control this. 
MO: So 
it kind of drops them gently 
in there? 
EL: Yeah, 
it drops them in there. 
MO: 
Into this red tank 
EL: Exactly. And as you see, there are pipes all 
around it and 
there are holes 
in the pipes. This 
is where the water travels, 
and the water pressure pushes them up the conveyor. You can keep 
this cold, too, by having an 
ice maker or some kind of 
ice 
inside 
it. The peaches come up the conveyor and they go onto what is 
called an eliminator. 
MO: 
Is that the green section? 
EL: Yeah, the thing just before the — the unpainted piece of 
equipment there 
is the eliminator. And as you can see, there's a 
chain with certain dimensions; 
the peaches fall 
through that 
chain on out to a different conveyor or to a different basket 
or bushel. 
MO: And how does that work, the eliminator? What makes them get 
eliminated? 
EL: Okay. This piece of tin 
is taken away. That's for cucumbers. 
And you have this space. So when they come on through here, 
if 
they're undersized they'll fall through and down the chute and 
out the back. And the bigger ones will 
go over into the washer 
and get brushed. 
You aren't here when this 
is happening. 
MO: 
I'm going to try and come back 
if I can. 
EL: Yeah, 
it's pretty neat. 
MO: I want to see 
it. 
EL: Okay, the peaches fall out the back of the washer and go on 
to a dryer. They come up the dryer and they go onto a conveyer 
where the rejects are taken out. 
MO: How does that happen? 
EL: There are two people on both sides or one person, depending 
on how bad the crop 
is. 
Just taking out anything with a mark or 
some kind of a blemish that would make it a reject, not a number 
one. And then they would go onto the sizer. 
MO: That's the round tray here? 
EL: That's the turntable. The sizer is this thing along the wall. 
That's the green thing along 
the wall. And the sizer has one, 
two, three -- five different settings. We're using four settings 
right now on 
it. The next size that were eliminated above these. 
These would be anything under two inch or maybe under one and 
7/8. Anything larger than two inch would go onto the sizer and 
the two inch up would go 
into that belt into the following room 
onto that two way belt. They would be everything from two inch on 
up to two and a quarter. A quarter size 
is opened further and the 
two and a quarter would come over this table. 
MO: Can we take a look at that? 
EL: Yeah. 
MO: So the ramp or whatever it 
is 
is sized to fit that piece or 
else 
it gets pushed to a wider --
EL: Exactly. The further down you go the more open you can 
control 
it. You went from two inch on up to two and a quarter 
over there. So on this table you have everything from two and a 
O'Connor--85 Audiocassette logs 
page 115 
quarter on up, 
two and a half. 
MO:. Well, that's pretty exact. I didn't know it was that exact. 
EL: Widths of a quarter inch, yeah. 
MO: That's pretty amazing. 
EL:. Yeah, we'll take a profile of that machine, you'll be able 
to see the spinoff and how it's controlled in the back, the way 
you can actually open and close each section. 
The peach 
is 
round, and 
it travels like a round ball. The sizer 
actually spins 
it and carries it at the same time. 
It's pretty 
unique. The (?)are pretty sharp. The ones we're using now are 
even computer controlled, they're so much different. 
But the 
guy who made the first one really had the idea of something 
spinning and something being carried at the same time, to make 
that thing completely --
MO: To test it out all 
sides or (inaudible) 
EL: See, 
it's pretty fast. The peaches move through here -- you 
can pack, what would we say, there's 20 boxes to a bin. We can 
pack ten bins real quick push them right through there. I've seen 
times when as fast as the fork lift can push the box down, have 
it go back and pick up another one, 
it keeps that thing really 
busy, just picking up 20 boxes at once and putting them on a 
conveyor. I'm not saying that you're packing 20 boxes in one 
moment. But over 
a period of seconds you're probably packing one 
every five to six seconds. 
MO: Really. They're being packed by a human being, right? 
EL: Yeah, there's three people that 
stand on this table. One 
person stands here, here and there. 
And we have these conveyors 
going across, all meeting and 
joining. And one person's job 
would be to take the box off 
of this conveyor here where it's 
lined up for the next room, the next person would then take 
it 
and fill 
it again or do something else to 
it. Basically what 
these people will be doing is just filling the boxes. This person 
would be copying it off. 
MO: Does each box have a number of different sized peaches in 
it? 
EL: Yeah, 
let's go back to what I said earlier. The first table 
would have two to two and a quarter so anything within that 
quarter inch range would go on that table. Anything from two and 
a quarter up to two and a half would go on this range. And you 
see that odd—shaped looking thing up there hanging on the wall? 
It's gray and 
it has like steps in 
it? 
MO: Yeah. 
EL: That's what we use to set the machine. You see, the first 
size all 
the way down is probably two inch. So everything that 
size on up to that size would go over there. And you see the 
difference by a quarter of an inch? That would come here, and the 
next would go there. 
And that's what we use, that's the gauge 
that we use. 
MO: What I was wondering was when you said this box comes from 
the other room and then she fills it you meant it comes empty. 
EL: 
It comes empty, yeah. 
MO: I was thinking maybe over in the 
other room they put so many 
of one size in, 
and then she came and added another size. 
O'Connor--85 Audiocassette logs 
page 116 
EL: No, no. Brokers don't like when you do that. No. They want a 
true pack. They want to see what's on the top 
is the same as 
what's on the bottom. 
Yeah, so she'll take the box up and they'll both fill 
it and top 
it off. So as fast as she can reach from a box and fill 
it, 
reach 
for another box and fill 
it, 
that time 
is between five to seven 
seconds. 
MO: That's amazing. 
EL: So what would that be, how many seconds? 
MO: That's 12 a minute or ten a minute. 
EL: Yeah, easy. You can pack a 100 an hour. 
If you have the 
peaches you can pack a 100 an hour, no problem. So you figure 
there's a 1000 on a trailer, so that would be ten hours. I think 
we've done it 
in nine. 
MO: Sounds amazing to me. Does this thing spin around this table? 
EL: Yeah. 
MO: So 
it keeps them moving --
EL: Yeah, hold on (inaudible). It's better that you come back 
when we're in operation with a camera and take some shots of 
this. It's completely different when there's three on the table. 
MO: Must get pretty colorful. 
EL: Colorful? Yeah, 
it does. 
(Machine noise.) That's the way 
that sounds. 
(Inaudible.) And your first number one peach, which 
is a two inch up, comes out the second sizer over to the next 
room on a two way belt. They get packed there. And the two and 
a quarter, two and a half, come on this table. Now, this is 
the number one peach; this is the one that everybody wants, 
the chain store, the housewife. 
MO: Two and a half inch? 
EL: Two and a quarter up to two and a half. 
In other words, 
it's 
not too big, 
it's not too small. You can give two to your 
children and expect them to eat it. 
MO: 
It's funny how that works, 
isn't it? 
EL: Yeah. 
MO: Do you have any idea how that happens? That everybody would 
go for that particular size? 
EL: Yes, because it's not. too big. Nobody wants to buy something 
for their child and have them start to eat it and they can't 
finish it. 
So everything has to be done according to plan. 
MO: So can you actually gear your picking toward that end, of 
getting the right size? 
EL: Oh, yeah. 
MO: Do you try and do that? 
EL: Sure, you do that by actually taking the peaches off the tree 
and only leaving a certain amount on 
it, equal distance apart 
from each other. See, 
if 
it ever touched a tree the tree might 
have so much of a load that the limbs would break; the limbs 
wouldn't be able to support the amount of peaches that are being 
made on the tree Or you might only have 
it on one side of the 
tree. 
The other side might not have any at all, 
so you're going 
to have to do something to that side of the tree to make it 
equal But basically you do that for that reason, to have 
O'Connor--85 Audiocassette logs 
page 117 
them all mature at the same time and all mature at the same 
size. 
MO: So thinning is toward that end. 
EL: You can't see 
it while you're doing it, 
really you can't 
understand while you're doing it. But it doesn't make sense 
because you're actually covering the ground with peaches, you're 
stepping all 
over them. You're saying,what am I doing? 
But you can see the result in here, that extra quarter inch might 
mean seven dollars, 
it might mean eleven dollars. 
MO: Per? 
EL: Box. 
MO: Per box? 
EL: Yeah, so there's four hours difference, okay? I've seen a 
year when I've seen 15-21. That's a lot of money. That's six 
bucks per box difference, that extra quarter inch. It's so 
incredible, 
it 
is. So that's why we're going for large fruit now. 
And instead of packaging, marketing them as bulk or as crates, we 
try and market them individually. 
Yeah, this 
is heavy. 
MO: How does that work? 
EL: Okay, we have another package here besides the standard 38 
pound peach crate. 
MO: This 
is going to be 
like the individual tomato kind of a 
thing? 
EL: Exactly. 
MO: These flats here, that's a different kind of a box too, 
isn't 
it? 
EL: That's not a box, just a lid. 
MO: Oh, a lid for the crate. 
EL: Yeah. I think I have somewhere here a (inaudible) but let me 
take a look upstairs. 
MO: So you use the second floor basically for storage? 
EL: Yeah. (Inaudible). 
MO: Yeah. I don't get it. 
EL: There was hot water going through here. These are coils that 
went all 
the way around the room. 
MO. No kidding. Hot water coils, fantastic 
EL: (Inaudible.) 
MO: Oh, for the walls, too. Yeah, I see 
it. And you kept them 
warm during winter. 
EL: Winter. 
MO: Oh, because they'd sell during the winter to the --
(End of Side One.) 
EL: (Inaudible.) 
MO: Listen, I hadn't even thought to ask you about how much 
it 
costs to buy all your boxes and crates. A lot of money. You get 
them broken down and you put them together yourself? Because 
you've got these cardboard ones, right? You've got the wooden 
crates. 
O'Connor--85 Audiocassette logs 
page 118 
EL: Okay, now you see the difference in slides between that box 
and that box. This box here holds 38 pounds regular crates 
(inaudible). 
MO: So this looks about half the height or maybe two thirds. 
EL: Okay, this 
is 22 pounds of peaches.This is 38, this 
is 22. So 
you say this farmer will pack 40 pound, that farmer will pack 20 
pounds. So you can say 40 versus 20. But guess what? The price 
is 
the same. 
MO: No kidding. 
EL: The only difference is that every peach in this box 
is 
in a 
cup within a cell. There are cells that fit in here. 
MO: Like an egg carton kind of cell? 
EL: Yeah. And then you have a divider and then you have a second 
level. So you have two, one on the bottom and one on the top. 
MO: : And they don't touch each other. 
EL: No. 
MO: What about the top? Do they touch each other box on box? 
EL: Well, there's a lid that goes on here. And then you can stack 
them. They're made in such a way that as 
long as you don't fill 
them up too high, as 
long you..keep the peach 
in the right—sized 
cup, and they're all 
in there without banging into each other, 
they can stack on a pallet, you can probably stack them seven, 
eight high. 
In other words (inaudible) 64 to a pallet. 64 to a pallet, you're 
getting the same money as -- 48 of these on a pallet, but you're 
gaining so much more because you're getting that many more; 
boxes. If you figure it out, 
it's beneficial. The only thing you 
lose between the two 
is the time that it takes you to do 
it. This 
way, you're taking the box and you're opening the chute and the 
peaches are falling through and you're just filling the box. 
MO: Oh, I was wondering, this metal hoop around the table 
is 
open, huh? 
EL: Yeah, these are (inaudible). 
MO: I see, I see, because what I was 
thinking, 
if somebody was 
filling a box ten seconds and picking stuff over the hoop 
(inaudible) 
EL: We even have things that are built in the (?)but we've 
disconnected them now. One of our -- we even have mechanical 
gates that (inaudible) 
They would just open and close when the 
box was full, auto matic box fillers. But they're always breaking 
down so much that we're not bothering to use them. So the box 
comes 
in here, we fill 
it up. And as fast as 
it takes you to open 
this and fill 
it, 
then you go on to your next box. 
MO: They just keep coming out of--
EL: Like I said, every five seconds. Now, these -- 
it would be 
impossible to fill a box like that. 
MO: The cardboard smaller ones. 
EL: Because you have to take every peach one at a time and look 
at 
it and put it 
in. And 
if 
there's one spot or something that's 
wrong with the peach you have to put it aside, put it on a 
different box. As where 
this, 
it doesn't matter. Some of those 
can go into here. 
But every one of these peaches has to be , 
O'Connor--85 Audiocassette logs 
page 119 
every one has to be because they're going to be sold by the 
peach. And you have to pack them that way, 
if you want to get 
that money. You can get that money, you can get 20 dollars for 
this. 
MO: Do you think it's worth it?-
EL: That's what I don't know. 
MO: 
It's brand new, this idea? 
EL: No, 
it's been around for a couple of years. But the idea of 
what it's doing and where it's 
going is new. And people are 
marketing this now by the peach They're not buying the boxes and 
sell 
the box. Now they're taking the peaches out themselves and 
selling them. This is what's happening to peaches. They're 
becoming a very exotic fruit. 
MO: Right. 
EL: Hard to get. (Recording interrupted.) 
MO: About the crates. I can see that everything comes flat, 
right, except for the baskets. 
EL: Right. 
MO: 
Is a lot of time spent in putting 
those things together or 
EL: Oh, sure. This is what this is really for. We use 
it for 
packing cucumbers, but basically when we get out of cucumbers 
business where it's strictly 
trees, this will be the room where 
all 
the supplies are made all 
the boxes are made and then just 
sent down these chutes. 
MO: Oh, so there's another person over here making boxes all 
the 
time? 
EL: Oh, yeah. 
MO: That's interesting. 
EL: Yeah, there's usually about eight or nine people 
in here at 
once, everybody doing something different. 
MO: So at the height of the season you say you're employing nine 
people in the packing house or ten you've got ten workers in 
the 
field, plus you and your dad, 
right? 
EL: Yeah. 
ML: And free labor 
MO: Paid for in peaches or something? 
(Simultaneous discussion -- unintelligible.) 
MO: Oh, this 
is 
insulated too. 
EL: Yeah, we use this room in winter time to pack apples in. We 
cut this room off from the rest the packing house and just keep 
this room -- we got heaters. 
MO: Space heater. I've got to get a picture of that 
EL: 
Isn't that crazy? 
MO: 
It is crazy. Looks like 
it's so modern 
EL: (Inaudible) put that fan on top or 
it and it just blows the 
heat right out. 
MO: Looks like something out of an early science fiction movie 
(inaudible). 
EL: And this here was just insulation and I think we put the on 
the top for some reason 
or another, I don't know why we did 
O'Connor--85 Audiocassette logs 
page 120 
that. But we just turned it upside down. 
MO: Maybe some kind of reflecting surface upstairs. 
EL: Yeah, we did that for a reason. I don't know what the reason 
was. Oh, I think we were cover eventually with plywood and 
(inaudible) be better to do this it that way. Once I do that, 
then I'll paint that white and 
MO: That's what I was going to ask you. We didn't talk about this 
(inaudible). But could you describe it a little bit, 
in terms of 
how long 
it's been here and - you told me a little bit about it 
the other day. 
EL: Okay, as soon as I get a cigarette. 
MO. (Inaudible.) 
EL: Yeah, well, 
it just automatically goes the way it's made. But 
if 
you take it 
in the house 
and you want to paint the dining 
room or something (inaudible 
MO: Plus you get a nice job on your floor too, I guess. This is 
great, though. 
EL: Yeah, these cost about 65 dollars and they're good forever. 
They never rust, and as 
long as (inaudible). They're hard to keep 
around, though. That's 
why we make sure -- we always count the 
amount of 
ladders and the amount of men. When they leave in the 
morning and when they come back, 
it's the same. Same thing with 
all my tools 
(inaudible). I don't like for people using my 
tools. 
MO: No, I don't think anybody does. 
EL: And my father lets the world use his. 
MO: Really? That's a shame. 
EL: Not his good ones. 
MO: (Inaudible.) 
MO: Does he have a sign-out list or anything? That's what I do 
now if anyone wants to borrow anything, they have to sign a sheet 
of paper. People I know, 
because you don't remember who took it, 
right? I don't, 
anyway. 
EL: Yeah. 
MS. (Inaudible.) 
MO: (Inaudible.) 
MO: I saw a tractor pull 
in -- (Several minutes inaudible 
discussion.) 
EL: So the idea of marketing a peach, the person is selling by 
the box or by the palette to -- selling them to someone who sells 
them individually. That's where the money is 
in the peach 
business right now in 
marketing. 
MO: I like this exotic idea. 
EL: Yeah, 
it's becoming hard to grow. They're becoming harder and 
harder to keep these trees alive The trees keep dying and we keep 
losing crops. 
MO: Because of the frost and stuff? 
EL: So if 
you have one year that you don't pick anything, or pick 
only ten percent, that's bad. 
MO: What are you going to get this year, do you think? 
EL: 
I'm getting a hundred percent. My father is getting about 30. 
MO: So you're getting a 100 percent or what you expect to get out 
of your trees? 
O'Connor--85 Audiocassette logs 
page 121 
EL: Yeah. 
MO: Your father covers certain acreage and you cover certain 
acreage, 
is that --
EL: Yeah, one's on one side of the swamp and the other is 
in this 
side. The -- mine was purchased 
recently, 
in 1980. I've only 
had 
it for five years. His has 
been there since 1902. 
MO: So you primarily just work on your --
EL: No, I work his, too. 
MO: You work his, too. 
EL: Yeah. But it's different, because it has to be that way for 
certain reasons. But basically it's different ground, too, and 
it 
has to be approached that way Different type of terrain there 
altogether than here. 
Trees need more attention, and they need 
more water because it's sandy ground, better ground here for 
peaches. 
MO: But how come he got hit so hard? 
EL: He trimmed too early. The buds were wide open when the frost 
came. Mine were all closed. I didn't trim them until after the 
frost. 
MO: So he trimmed, then the frost hit. 
EL: He trimmed before, then when the frost hit --
MO: I see. So 
if you trim early they bud early? 
EL: Yeah. If you trim early it has a tendency to push everything 
on and the flowers open sooner. 
There's less wood on the tree. 
MO: So you're taking a risk. 
EL: Yeah. 
MO: 
It's a matter of days, that's all 
EL: And certain varieties,that morning, when the helicopters are 
flying over and the temperature was down to -- that was pretty 
cold. 
MO: 22 or something like that? 
EL: Something like that, yes. When 
it's down that cold, it's 
just a matter of hours, when you can actually see, you can 
actually tell -- I think the 
people from Rutgers, they have some 
kind of equipment and they knew what orchards were what. They had 
a certain kind of thermometer. And they knew when that block was 
going. That variety just went. 
MO: Oh, my God. That's terrible. So 
it really 
is beneficial for 
you to wait as 
long as possible then. 
EL: Yeah. The methods that we used years ago really can't be used 
now. Everything is getting to be a science and everything 
(inaudible). But they really haven't figured out a way that they 
can go into the green house type thing yet. I'm sure it's going 
to come today, 
eventually. But right now they're just trying to 
turn the 
mistakes into better fortune And the only way to do 
that is 
by going through something like this, and knowing. 
Because you're not going to read about it 
in a book. But what 
happens this year might not happen next year.So this was 
something 
that was just spooky, that the guys who were the 
second rate farmers, the ones that weren't on top of 
everything,the ones that did do a second—rate job, are the ones 
O'Connor--85 Audiocassette logs 
page 122 
that have the profits, because they got behind in their work and 
they couldn't do what they're supposed to do. 
MO: Yeah. 
EL: So that makes the peach even harder to grow, makes the price 
go up. But it 
is a summer fruit, 
it's something that everybody 
wants 
in the summertime and everybody looks for, just like 
blueberries or tomatoes. 
MO: Definitely 
EL: And it's one of the things New Jersey is noted for. I think 
that selling it by the peach, too, I think it's the better idea 
concept of growing peaches because if you're selling them in bulk 
or whatever you might not do a good job. This way they have to do 
a good job, out in the field and 
in the (inaudible). You don't 
want to put a peach 
in there that has a hail mark or a big 
blemish 
on it, 
even somewhere on the bottom if you think you're 
getting away with something. You're really not. The only 
thing you're doing is (inaudible). And 
if a store or a person or 
whatever gets a box of peaches and every one 
is saleable 
I 
know, because I was 
in that end of 
it. 
MO: Oh, really? 
EL: Yeah, when I 
box and you have 
guy 
is going t 
that box, I wa 
want that box.

Then yo 
around to your 
the 
rejects a 
trade for them 
at the same ti 
taking you a I 
and at the sam 
sticking bad p 
yourself. Beca 
going to come 
you can tell. 
MO: Right, nothing quite direct, but you get it. 
EL: You can tell. 
MO: I wanted to ask you, 
it seems like most of your stuff goes 
out in tractor trailers to Wakefield? 
EL: Wakefern. 
MO: Wakefern i 
There's places 
there's places 
to do, once ag 
peach, but we 
through all 
th 
the store as m 
box of.peache,

times out

means you're g 
check 
is going 
had the farm market. 
And I know, 
if you buy the 
waste, that's you 
profit. And that's what the 
o remember. Well 
I've got a 100 percent out of 
nt that box I 
don't care how much it costs, I 
Once you get that reputation, that's all you 
u can have people, hucksters or whatever come 
place , and you can sell them the number twos or 
nd get a good price for them, but have a special 
, where maybe you're getting more out of that. And 
me you're getting more out of this. It's 
just 
ittle bit of thought to build the other thing up, 
e time you're building this up, too. But by 
eaches 
in the bottom of the box you're only hurting 
use when the reports come back to you, they're 
back, well, we got enough. The want apples now, and 
s only one. That's just 
-- it's a Shoprite. 
like that all 
over. 
Wakefern is pretty big, but 
all 
over Acme 
and A&P, warehouses. What we try 
ain, not only 
marketing by the box and by the 
try to eliminate going through a broker and going 
at selling and 
reselling We try to deal direct to 
uch as 
possible. Wakefern might have a price for a 
s, 
and it might be 15 dollars. (Inaudible) might 
on the farm. That's a real good price but nine 
ten you're going to have to sell 
it for 13, which 
oing to get paid at the end of the week and the 
to be there But it's two dollars a box less than 
O'Connor--85 Audiocassette logs 
page 123 
getting 
a dollar a box lower 
commission at their 
stuff. 
And they're 
they're saying that 
the thing I'm saying 
what they're getting 
same price as the warehouse price. 
have to figure that, okay, you can 
on the farm, you can get 15 
if you 
store might be twenty miles away. 
set it up so that every store is getting like a certain 
a certain day so we don't lose any trips. But you still 
have to have a truck. If you already have the truck, 
it's not too 
u have to go out and rent one and have 
a driver 
t gets to be costly, for insurance and all 
that. So you 
nd of weigh it up. 
If you can spread that two dollars a 
any higher, it's definately worth it. But if you're 
et 14 here on the 
farm, 
it's better to take the 14 
through all that 
nonsense for one dollar. 
it seems like a lot of work. 
re . 
own 
trucks that would come down to 
I through the warehouse. 
So you 
amount 
if 
you sold right to the sto 
MO: Well, do they have their 
pick 
it up? 
EL: No, no. They dea 
MO: Right. 
EL:Now, they'll deal 
direct, 
if 
you have 
at the wareh 
bad. 
If 
yo 
besides, i 
have to k 
 
box on up 
going to g 
than to go 
MO: Yeah, 
EL: Yeah. 
MO: The yellow truck out there, do you 
use that for any --
EL: No, that's just for storage. That 
runs (inaudible) boxes and 
the packing up. What I usually 
do 
is 
rent a truck. I'll 
rent 
from Ryder or from Miller 
where there's truck leasing places. 
But that gets to be 
expensive, too, because that's $5,000 at the 
end of the year, too. So you have to figure that you go 5,000 
boxes at two dollars a box more. It has to be profitable. 
(Recording interrupted.) 
with you. The stores will deal with you 
a product that's comparable to what they're 
ouse at a lower price. They expect you to be 
, because they figure that there's a 
end too that they have to pay for hauling the 
not getting the , they're going direct. 
So 
it should be a dollar a box cheaper. Well, 
is that we can produce a better quality than 
from the warehouse 
so we should get the 
And we usually do. So now you 
a box here 
re. The 
get 13.00 dollars 
take it to the sto 
Yeah, so you have to sell 
box more than you could s 
kind of one or the other. 
to get away with it, beca

in 
th 
real 
good job and you're 
think you'll get the same 
chain store, because the

be making his money, too. 
On the building itself, 
is 
This 
is the original, yes. 
And was it built by your father 
No, 
it was already a structure

if you're doing a 
nice box of peaches, I

nd Long Island, up in 
counts are. And he'll still 
this it original packing house? 
's father, or --
when they bought it, which 
page 124 
was 1908. So 
it's pretty old 
I think the turn of the century 
before 
MO: So the boxes are packed. Now what happens? 
EL: Well, the two are over there, the two and a quarter are over 
here, the two and a half -- these usually go over here. And this 
will stay over here on this table. 
MO: Right. 
EL: The larger ones come out on the last --take a look at the 
size of the ones (inaudible) 
MO: . Yeah. 
EL: You can see the different sizes now 
MO: Okay, sure. 
EL: This thing pulls the belt, and those things spin around 
MO: Okay, that's how -- there are rollers on each -- right, I see 
I'll have to get a photo graph of that. 
EL: Yeah, with the peaches coming down there 
it 
looks really 
sharp. Because the big ones drop 
in and the small ones drop over 
there . 
MO: Right,makes sense. 
EL: Yeah, the guy really had his 
stuff together, who made the 
first one --
MO: Right, yeah; 
it's a great invention. So the large ones --
EL: The large ones are on here. These would be two and three 
quarter and up. And that's a 15.00 trade pack. Then they come 
down here to these conveyors and get put up over here. And these 
boxes that (inaudible) This 
is a door into another core, a small 
core. This purpose is to have the pack boxes ready and 
in the 
small core for; when the truck comes to 
load up. All you have to 
do 
is take them out of the small core, whatever you pack for that 
day. You may pack 500, 600 boxes. That's about 10,000. You should 
be able to fit 10,000 in here with no problem. If you're 
(inaudible). But if you have a bumper crop and you have a lot of 
peaches, that whole thing might be taken off the bins. You don't 
have any room for your pack boxes. So what ever you pack, you put 
in here. 
MO: And this 
is what, 16 by 20? 
EL: I guess, yes, something like that 
MO: Where does the truck pull up? 
EL: Over here. So 
it gets scooped out of here with the fork lift, 
backs up over here. 
(Inaudible). 
EL: Right. 
MO: So the truck pulls up and you 
load 
it up. 
EL: Right. 
MO: That's great. Now, did you build this ramp when you built the 
new cooler? 
EL: Right. 
MO: You pour this yourselves, too? 
EL: No. 
MO: Nice job. 
EL: Yeah, they did a great job. 
MO: So that's the peaches. 
O'Connor--85 Audiocassette logs 
page 125 
EL: Let's get to the cuke 
(Inaudible) cukes come 
in here over to 
the washer (inaudible) Now, the only thing you have to do --
that's a long walk, 
isn't it? The only thing you have to do 
is 
just change the 
direction of this belt. We have a on the other 
side, 
it runs from one way, now it goes this way. You take off, 
and now the cukes are coming into here. Now, they come across 
this conveyor. This is a waxer. 
MO: Oh, really? I've been wondering about these things. This is 
where they wax 
EL: Yeah. This 
is a waxer with a coil 
inside and 
it heats the 
wax and the wax heats up and 
drips across and lays over the 
tops of the cucumbers. 
MO: Just brushes them, huh? 
EL: Yeah. 
It just puts the wax on. 
This is the buffer, 
it puts a 
shine like a shoeshine. 
MO: Yeah, a whole series of things. 
EL: (Machine noise, 
inaudible.) 
MO: So is that just something to tide you over until the peaches 
start happening, or -- ? 
EL: Yeah. See, what it 
is, when you block out an orchard, when 
you put 
in 500 peach trees or a thousand peach trees, you have 
to do something with the ground 
in the meantime, because you're 
talking four acres for nine acres of ground. And you don't want 
to tie that much ground 
up without having something coming 
in 
off of 
it. So you plant in between the trees. And everything that 
you're 
doing to the ground 
is getting absorbed in the root system 
of the tree, so 
it's actually making the tree -- I can show 
you 
places out in the field where the trees look like they're four 
years old, they're only two, for that reason. So this is the 
cucumbers. They come up to here, they come on this belt and what 
happens is, there's somebody standing down here and they just 
(inaudible) show one side up (inaudible) just take that box and 
put it up here and take the other box down. 
MO:: I s there a pallet here or something that they roll onto 
right away? 
EL: (Inaudible) come down the conveyor the person tops 
it off, or 
this way, both sides at once. 
Once again, as fast as this 
person can fill one box, (inaudible) fill that box, that's as 
fast as you can put on a pallet. That's why they're getting into 
wider things now. 
This used to be the standard years ago, but 
maybe now they're 
36 inches wide. 
MO: Yeah, I think it's 24 or --
EL: So that's the cucumber deal. 
MO: And how much business do you do 
in cucumbers? 
EL: We could pack anywhere from a couple hundred a day to a few 
hundred a day. 
MO: Boxes? 
EL: Boxes, yes. 
MO: (Inaudible) cucumbers? 
EL: That varies. It can go as 
low a six dollars, 
it can go as 
high as 16. Some years I've seen when 16 wasn't hard to get. But 
other years where six was real hard to get. You couldn't even get 
O'Connor--85 Audiocassette logs 
page 126 
that. 
It fluctuates a lot. I just want to turn these lights off. 
MO: You use the cooler for the cucumbers as well? 
EL: No. 
They don't need to be as cold. 
You never want to chill them, 
take them down to 35 degrees, because they freeze. What some 
farmers do 
if they want to 
keep them for a day 
is, 
they'll make 
sure that they're out of the sunlight, they may even (inaudible) 
they'll cool 
at 60, 
just to keep them cool. But that's all 
they 
do. 
MO: Good idea. I'm beginning to understand what they say about 
you keeping busy all 
the time. 
(Inaudible.) 
MO: That's right. 
EL: This 
is where everything gets fixed. 
MO: This is the building where that roof flew off when the 
tornado got inside the building. 
EL: Yeah, exactly, where the tools were strung across all 
over 
the yard 
MO: Also that used to be the barn where the fire was, right? 
EL: Exactly. 
MO: Same spot. 
EL: As you see we have all kinds of 
toolmaking equipment in 
here. And (inaudible) if something breaks down you have to fix 
it. 
You can't be sending for people every time something breaks 
down. 
MO: So just about anything that break down, you've got to fix 
it. 
EL: Yeah, you have to do 
it yourself. 
They didn't have a lift 
in 
those days 
in the pit, but it 
works (inaudible). There's a lot 
of work done here, just the trucks and tractors and cars. That 
motor in that thing has been replaced twice. 
MO: So 
is that an orchard tractor? 
EL: That's an orchard tractor. 
MO: How wide are the wheels on that? 
EL: Five and a half foot. 
MO: And the sprayer on the back of 
it 
is that for the (inaudible) 
when you're first spraying? I can't remember the name of the 
chemical you were telling me about. 
EL: The (?)spray is one and (?)is the other. And you use those 
in 
combination with a microshield, which 
is used for bacterial spot. 
MO: Boy, that can get expensive, huh? 
EL: Oh, yeah, especially this guy here. 
MO: Microshield? 
EL: Yeah, 
if you don't use it, your 
peaches get covered with 
black. And you use all 
this, and 
you use a surfaceant which is 
like a spreader. That makes 
it go a little longer 
It can go 
double the distance if 
you use a (?). 
It's crazy; chemicals is a 
whole trip 
in 
itself. 
You can make one wrong move and screw 
yourself up for the 
whole season. 
MO: Yeah, I can imagine. When you're dealing with this many 
different kinds of things. 
EL: Yeah, that's why it's so important just to stick to growing 
one thing and become real 
good at that Because it's becoming a 
O'Connor--85 Audiocassette logs

science, just one thing.

I've heard the same thing about cranberries.

This 
is just more or less New Jersey 
(Laughter.) 
MO: These orchards are beautiful 
looking, you know? It's so 
cultivated. I mean, every tree 
is manicured. 
EL: 
I burned these. I put too much fertilizer on them. It's a 
determinant plant, not like the plant down the row. This is a 
different type of plant. This plant really gets so big, and 
it 
starts to put most of 
its energy into making tomatoes, as 
opposed to making leaves, and I burned them. 
MO: 
That's the way you find out, right? 
EL: 
Here are some of the gigantic peaches. By the time they're 
big, they're going to be huge. They're going to be out to here, 
those things. 
MO: 
What? Are they almost two inches now? 
EL: 
These are probably two and an eighth. Two and an eighth, 
yeah. 
MO: They're green and fuzzy. 
EL: 
These guys got hurt. See, that's why (inaudible) even 
though they're not spaced properly, they'll still mature the 
same. 
MO: 
What's proper spacing? 
EL: 
Every four to five inches between a peach. There's plenty 
of that here. We don't have to worry about that. On this branch 
here, really you should take that peach out (inaudible) coming 
down this way you really don't have to. 
It takes one peach and 
15 
leaves to get a good—sized peach. 
MO: 
So 
if you've got four right smack next to each other, as 
long as (inaudible). 
EL: 
Yeah. But if this was all 
like this, see, you'd have to 
take them out and have them every four. 
MO: 
Uh — 
huh. 
EL: 
Four to five. This variety here is . 
MO: 
You have ten varieties you said or something like that? 
EL: 
This should be thinned now. 
See, there's too many in here. 
So you have to take all 
these out. 
MO: 
I see what you mean. It seems like a waste from this point 
of view just dropping them on the ground. 
EL: Right. But these will blow up now, and they'll all 
be the 
O'Connor--85 Audiocassette logs 
page 129 
same size. See like 
in here, the cluster? 
MO: Yeah. Now is there any way of saving those or letting them 
--can they ripen on their own? 
EL: 
No. 
MO: 
They're dead. 
EL: 
It's too late for this job now. This should have been done 
before. But I guess he's just thinking that they're going to 
make 
it anyway and he'd rather just make the two and a quarter 
than make it two and three—quarters. He's always so depressed, 
you know? (Inaudible) saying, 
"I don't see any from the 
outside." I said, "Well, you've got to go inside and look." I 
mean, 
look, he's got them. 
MO: 
There's a lot of peaches here. 
EL: 
He's got a box right here. 
MO: 
So you don't think that it's actually 30 percent then, do 
you? 
EL: 
(Inaudible). 
MO: 
It's that bad? 
EL: 
It 
is. 
It 
is that bad, yeah. A hundred percent -- I'll 
take 
you over to my farm, and you'll see what a hundred percent is. 
MO: There's a lot of peaches on here. 
EL: Yeah, he's got a good box to maybe two boxes to a tree, a 
box and a half to a tree. That's not bad. He might get 20 bucks 
a tree. There' s 
what is 
it? -- 5,000 trees? What does that 
come to? 
MO: 
$20,000.00? No, 
I'm sorry. What did you say? 5,000 trees 
times what? 
EL: 
No, some trees don't have any, so you're going to have to 
say probably 2,000 trees. 2,000 trees times 20. 
MO: 
40,000? 
EL: 
Yeah. 
MO: 
But also the market's going to reflect the fact that a lot 
of people don't have any peaches, right? 
EL: 
I'll 
do more than 40,000 and I only have 15 acres. 
MO: And this is? 
EL: Forty 
MO: So you 
II 
have a very good year. 
EL: This 
is almost normal, this here. 
MO: 
It's too many though, 
isn't it? 
EL: Yeah. 
MO: There aren't the 
leaves to support it. What kind of 
questions aren't I asking about this? What's important that I'm 
not getting? Because I don't know what I don't know. 
EL: You're doing fine. You're getting the whole thing. 
MO: All 
right, great. 
EL: You're getting the whole thing. 
In fact, we're covering more 
today than most people cover in a lifetime. 
MO: Oh, all 
right, great. 
EL: 
It's good that you have that, because you never could 
remember. 
MO: No, I know. That's what I meant about bringing the tape 
recorder initially. I'd either be writing furiously or, you know 
-- so these varieties. You have ten or so, you said? 
O'Connor--85 Audiocassette logs 
page 130 
EL: Peaches, yeah. 
MO: And what are the names of those? 
EL: Starting with Red Haven, there's Red Haven, Harbright, Glow 
Haven, Slayball Special, Varring, Early Rio, Norman, Presthaven 
(ALL PHONETIC) --
MO: 
Is there something like Georgia Bell or something like that? 
EL: 244, Georgia Glow. There's Redskins, Autumn Glow, there's 
Emory, a couple more, too. That's about ten. about -- anywhere 
from 200 on up through 300 trees to the acre. 
MO: Why do you grow so many different varieties? 
EL: Because you want to extend your season. You want to have a 
longer season. 
MO: 
It looks different than the inside of 
EL: That's just because of the way I broke it. 
If you were to 
cut 
it, 
it would be all 
right 
MO: Yeah. Um, good. 
EL: 
It's nice walking through here when the peaches are getting 
ripe. What's real 
nice 
is walking through here after they've 
picked, a couple days later, and you might see -- find one they 
missed, you know, 
like way back somewhere. You take it and you 
can actually peel the skin right off, pop the stone right out. 
MO: Yeah. I definitely want to come out when this 
is 
all 
happening. 
EL: See, here's a dead tree here. Wherever we have a dead tree, 
we'll plant one or two right next to 
it, depending on how bad it 
is. See over there? 
MO: Yeah. 
EL: There's two dead trees there. We have one, two, three, four 
planted. 
MO: I remember you were saying treating them as one. 
EL: Uh—huh, uh—huh. 
MO: That's great. I think that's a good idea. I hope 
it works 
out. 
EL: Yeah. As you can see, when a tree gets old, even as old as 
these are , there's still plenty of room in there. 
MO: So they're only, what? Ten feet high at the maximum or 
something? 
EL: Yeah, some go 12. The majority of them are 10 feet. 
MO: So in the varieties, you have -- some are early, some are 
later? 
EL: Yeah, 
like one right here 
is a Lauren (PHONETIC), a much 
nicer quality tree. 
MO: Totally different color bark, too. 
EL: See that tree? 
MO: Yeah. 
EL: That's a hell 
of a tree. 
MO: So it just comes up as a single trunk and then spreads out 
about two feet off the ground 
in about five different 
directions. 
EL: Uh—huh. Look at the meat on that tree. That's a real healthy 
tree. The ones farther down there, you know, they're dying and 
they're hard to keep living. 
MO: That's not just age, huh? That variety too. 
O'Connor--85 Audiocassette logs 
page 131 
EL: That's right, 
it's variety, yeah This is a hell of a peach 
though. These things are going to get huge, humungous. These are 
two and a quarter now already 
MO: Yeah. This 
is not Lauren though 
EL: Uh—huh. 
MO: 
It 
is Lauren? 
EL: That's a Lauren 
MO: And what time of year do they come in? 
EL: August 15th, my birthday. 
MO: Oh, yeah? Congratulations. 
EL: All 
these need to be taken out. Send a man in here to do 
this. 
MO: So they're just sapping energy, huh? 
EL: Yeah, right. 
MO: And no 
low limbs, I mean, no 
low branches. They won't bear 
fruit that low? 
EL: Well, you want to put the energy to where the peaches are. 
You don't want to put the energy back into making leaves. 
There's enough leaves on the trees already. 
MO: Right. But I mean these leaves, these won't turn into 
branches, will they? 
EL: They will. 
MO: But you don't want them. 
EL: No, you have enough branches now. You want your peaches on 
the outside of the tree, where the sun 
is. You don't want them 
down here. 
MO: Right, okay. That makes sense. Well, are the trees bred to 
have short, stubby trunks and then limbs that fan out almost in 
a circle like spokes on a wheel? 
EL: Yeah. What you want to do, when you're trimming, you always 
want to keep this open. 
MO: 
In the middle? 
EL: Yeah. This should be cut here, 
it should be taken out. It's 
too 
late to do 
it now, because it's got peaches on 
it. 
MO: 
In the fall? 
EL: 
In the spring. When you're doing your trimming, you first 
come 
in here with a chainsaw, a small one, a small Homelite, and 
you do all 
your major clean—up work. These two were left here 
from last year. They were left. It's kind of strange, I don't 
know why. But I would take these two guys out and this with my 
small chainsaw and I would open the inside of the tree right up 
and 
let the sun 
in. 
MO: Oh, I see, so you not only get sun on the outside of the 
branches, but you get it 
in the center. 
EL: 
Inside You want to get the sun right here on the crotch 
MO: Oh, that's interesting. 
EL: That's what makes the tree grow, 
is sun 
in the crotch of the 
tree and on the leaves 
MO: That's great 
EL: Yeah, oh yeah. 
MO: I didn't know that. That's terrific. 
EL: Open the tree up 
let the sun in. 
If not, your peaches will 
never get color and your tree will never grow properly, because 
O'Connor--B5 Audiocassette logs 
page 132 
the tree likes hot weather. It likes Miami. 
MO: A bake 
EL: Yeah 
MO: And this 
is how -- like this trunk, for example -- well, 
you've got it mounded up with . dirt all 
around Do you always do 
that? 
EL: Yeah, for protection. 
MO: The trunk 
is maybe -- not even a foot higher than that. 
EL: Some are higher. Some are three feet. 
MO: How old is this tree? 
EL: Twelve. 
MO: Oh, I see. So 
it's prime and beyond at this point. 
EL: Uh—huh, it's prime and beyond. 
If you take care of them, 
they'll treat you -- they're like 14 or 15 before they start 
going the other way. 
MO: This is fascinating to me about opening up the middle. I 
think that's interesting. I mean, they're so manicured, 
it's 
amazing. 
EL: Like here too, all 
these would have to come out. 
MO: Oh, I see, 
like this stuff, right? 
EL: They're trying to leave as many branches on to get as many 
peaches on as possible. But I'd take this guy out and I'd take 
him right off and you'd have a nice open spot for the sun to 
come 
in. 
MO: Uh—huh. You can see 
EL: Look at this here. 
MO Yeah. 
EL: See how nice this is? 
MO: Yeah, beautiful. 
EL: So now he's probably just going to 
leave them like this. 
See, that got hurt by the frost, the one on the end. The ones 
inside are good, close to the wood. The ones (inaudible). So 
he's probably just leaving them like this and saying these will 
make enough leaves there. They won't get this big, but they'll 
get to be pretty good—sized. 
MO: They'll be salable. They'll be two inches, anyway. 
EL: Yeah. No, they're two inches now. They're two and an eighth 
right now. 
In fact, this guy here 
is almost a two and a quarter. 
MO: Yeah. 
EL: He's almost a two and a quarter. So he can almost go into a 
box for $15.00. 
MO: Sounds good to me. 
EL: Yeah Here's that nice color, see that nice (inaudible). 
MO: Here's a young one, right? 
EL: Yeah. This guy here 
is about four years old. 
MO: So he should be bearing, right? 
EL: He should be, yeah, but because of the year. It's got some. 
MO: Yeah, a couple of them. 
EL: Here's another one. 
MO: Do you ever lose your new trees to frost? 
EL: Oh, yeah. That whole field. 
MO: Oh, my gosh, that's terrible 
EL: That whole field. See, all 
these suckers, all 
these things 
O'Connor--85 Audiocassette logs 
page 133 
coming out here. 
MO: Yeah, I can see that, yeah. 
EL: 
It should be done now, before they get too hard. 
MO: So is that -- do you send your laborers around to do that 
kind of thing? 
EL: Yeah. As they sing their Mexican folk songs (sings phrase in 
Spanish), 
it puts you right back 
in Guadalajara or Mexico City. 
MO: A very close friend of mine speaks Spanish. I should bring 
her down here. 
EL: Oh, yeah? See, once again, (inaudible). You don't have to 
pull 
it out. Just let it rot. Eventually it's going to rot and 
it's going to get fertilizer and 
it will get worked into the 
ground. You asked me 
if we ever lose any orchards to frost. 
Here's a thousand trees (inaudible). They're four years old. 
They should have a bumper crop on there. They should have at 
least two boxes to a tree. 
MO: But the trees (inaudible). 
EL: The tree, yeah. You might have (inaudible). 
(Segment inaudible -- outside interference.) 
EL: Yeah, this 
is a four—year old tree, or a three—year old 
tree. Well, whatever. You can't plant the peach row. But the 
first two years, you can. This is a three—year old tree. For the 
first two years, you can plant a row of cucumbers on the peach 
row too, between the trees. But the third year, the way this 
field is, 
you can't, because their root system is too big. 
MO: The root system of the tree? 
EL: Yeah. They just go 
in between them. 
MO: Now is this water? 
EL: Yeah, this 
is water. We're pushing a line across the street. 
There's a cucumber field over there. 
MO: So you're growing a lot of cucumbers. 
EL: Oh, yeah. Yeah, this 
is eight acres and there's five acres 
over there and five over the e So that's 18 acres. 
MO: Do you -- are they picked by hand? 
EL: 
I'd say there's 17. Yeah, oh yeah. Yeah, there's no cukes in 
here yet, but we're going to take a walk where there are. This 
noise we're coming up to 
is 
an 
irrigation pump. This sucker just 
sucks gas all 
day long. 
MO: So you're constantly irrigating some part of your(?) 
EL: We are constantly keeping one truck on call (inaudible 
This thing uses so much gas, 
it's pathetic. You see that b 
white tank? 
MO: Yeah. 
EL: We take that big white tank there, so we were going to use a 
diesel pump 
But it broke down and we didn't get it fixed. We're 
now using a gas pump and that one tank (inaudible) through it 
in 
one day. It's outrageous. 
MO: What's that? 200 gallons? 
EL: Yeah, 250 anyway, I guess. So 
it's $300.00 a day. 
MO: Just for irrigating. Where are you irrigating and when do 
you have to irrigate? 
O'Connor--85 Audiocassette logs 
page 134 
ig 
EL: We're irrigating two places, 
it seems. We're irrigating 
across the street and here. Right now, we're irrigating here. 
Across the street's turned off. 
MO: Why? 
EL: Because we're pushing a winch in the cucumber field down 
here. 
MO: Oh, so 
it's a cucumber field irrigation, not for the 
peaches. 
EL: Both. 
MO: Oh. How do you determine when, 
is what I wonder? 
EL: 
It gets hairy now. This orchard here 
is Presthaven. They're 
pretty good trees. 
MO: Their trunk 
is -- or their branches are so much smaller, 
it 
seems. 
EL: They're younger trees, yeah. 
MO: Oh, they're just younger. 
EL: Yeah. They're only about seven years old, six years old. 
MO: Darker fuzz on there, too. 
EL: Now there's a pretty good crop on here, but it's sparse. One 
side of the tree's got them and the other side doesn't. This 
branch has got them. 
If the whole tree was like this, 
it would 
be fine. But it's not. One side has them and the other side 
doesn't. This side has two, this side has a couple. So it's 30 
percent. 
MO: Yeah 
EL: (Inaudible). 
MO: So 232 is the name of 
it? 
EL: Autumn Glow, yeah. 
MO: Autumn Glow? 
EL: These are one of the late ones 
in the fall 
MO: Uh—huh That's quite a few. Not as many branches, I guess. 
EL: Yeah. Well, see, that's the thing. The trees start to die 
out. 
It's hard to keep them living. But see the crop you get? 
MO: Yeah. 
EL: And you keep trying to bring the back and plant more in 
between, but they don't start cropping until they get older. You 
see the difference? 
MO: Yeah. 
EL: That one doesn't have a crop on 
it. 
MO: Could you grow cucumbers down this lane? 
EL: 
It's too late now. 
MO: No, I mean, say, next year, 
if you wanted? 
EL: No. 
MO: The root system of the tree is too big? 
EL: Yeah, and 
it's on the surface of the ground, too. 
MO: Yeah, okay. 
EL: That's why you don't disk. That why you just cut the grass. 
MO: Yeah, I get it. And so you just have to spray and stuff for 
keeping around the tree 
EL: 
Insects, yeah. 
MO: -- clean. 
EL: That's weed control, yeah. 
MO: Yeah. 
O'Connor--85 Audiocassette logs 
page 135 
EL: You do your fumigation and weed at the same time. Fumigation 
(inaudible). 
MO: Right. 
EL: That's why all 
these trees died 
in the first place. There 
was nematode damage and lesser bore damage. 
MO: So that's something recent then. 
EL: See this black here? Okay, there's a bug 
in here, called the 
lesser bore. He's actually boring his way into the wood and he's 
pushing out all 
of his droppings and sap coming through. So what 
you've got to do 
is you've got to get a screwdriver, dig in 
here, find out where he's at, get him out, kill him, and then 
come back 
in here and paint this with white paint, and then put 
some lorsban (PHONETIC) and thydan (PHONETIC), which is a 
stomach material which 
is absorbed by the tree and 
it will kill 
the bug 
if you miss him with a screwdriver, because this is 
what' causing this tree to die. If you stand back here and look, 
you see the healthy growth coming in, 
the new growth? 
MO: Yeah. 
EL: See the good growth up on top? 
MO: Yeah, the leaves are so much smaller. 
EL: See where these are skimpy? Yeah well, he's doing 
it. 
So the 
nematode, which works on the root system of the tree and the 
lesser borer, which works on the top of the tree, 
is what's 
killing the trees. 
MO: So you've got it coming 
in 
all 
directions. 
EL: Yeah. That, 
in combination with the winter kill, which is 
what you asked me about, do you ever lose a whole orchard of 
trees? 
MO: Yeah. 
EL: Well, that's a factor, too, when it gets so cold, so 
drastically cold. Certain varieties can take it. Some can't. The 
ones that can't, die. So they're the three things that kill 
trees. I'd say the biggest problem with them all 
now is this 
lesser borer, this guy that's just burrowing in there and eating 
all 
the good wood or the tree. He's a pain 
in the ass. Here's 
that field of cucumbers. 
MO: Whoa, pretty good—sized. So when you say irrigation, it's a 
spray actually. 
EL: Yeah. That's what killed this tree, the lesser borer. 
MO: You can see all 
the sap coming out and how dark it 
is. 
EL: He's killing this one, too. 
MO: Once they get in there, 
is 
it a losing battle? 
EL: : Well, you have to kill 
him. 
If you can't kill him, you 
have to knock the orchard down and start over again. What we re 
doing here 
is we're just plugging in the holes. 
MO: This whole area got hit by those things? 
EL: Yeah. 
MO: God. 
EL: Well, see, then you have a beautiful tree like this. 
MO: Yeah. 
EL: So 
if 
you save 
it, 
it can work. 
MO: This looks more like apple almost or something. 
EL: Yeah, 
it's dark. (Inaudible). 
O'Connor--85 Audiocassette logs 
page 136 
MO: So it's a gun kind of an 
irrigation system, right? 
EL: When it gets to the end of the cycle, (inaudible). 
MO: What do you figure? It does a radium of 70 feet, 80 feet, 
something like that? 
EL: No, more than that, at least a hundred. 
MO: That's great. Boy, 
it's almost (inaudible). 
EL: Yeah, 
it's constant. You never stop. (Inaudible). Yeah, so 
these are the cucumbers here. 
If you look real close, you might 
find one. 
MO: There's one, right on your left there, right there. There's 
a little cuke. Whoa, pretty good—sized too. Look at that. Here's 
a --look at this one 
EL: That's better yet. Looks like -- yeah, they're growing all 
right. 
EL: 
It always amazes me, no matter how many gardens I've ever 
had, that things actually grow when you put stuff 
in the ground. 
I always assume that it will grow for everybody else, you know? 
I never assume that it will grow for me. But they do, you know? 
EL: 
(Inaudible) have to bite the skin. Spit the skin out and 
just bite the cucumber. They are so good, the first ones. 
MO: They're sweet. I'm not big on the wax either. I like it 
better dewaxed 
EL: Dry, yeah. 
MO: Do you have to wax them? 
MO: No. For certain brokers, you do. Farm markets don't like the 
wax. Now these trees here are two years old. 
MO: Uh—huh. 
EL: There's a couple that --
(End of Side A.) 
EL: All that gets chopped up when the season's over. So all that 
goes back down into the soil and gets absorbed by the root 
system of the tree. Now that guy's got a peach coming up. He's 
not supposed to. That's because he's got a lot of maturity 
MO: Yeah. Well, did you choose cucumbers because they were good 
for peach trees or just because you decided to grow them? 
EL: Oh, 
it's a good crop, I always make money with it. You 
always break even, anyway. Some years (inaudible). 
MO: This delicious chewing sound now on tape. Hmmmm. While 
you're listening to this, Mary, 1 want you to envy me, walking 
around eating fresh cucumbers right off the vine, tomatoes right 
out of the garden. 
This, you know, could happen to you too, 
if 
weren't sitting in your office right now listening to this thing. 
(Laughter) 
EL: Who's that? 
MO: That's the person that's probably going to end up 
listening 
to these tapes. She's writing a report on the Project. 
EL: See this side of 
the field? The plants are wilted from the 
sun. They didn't get the water yet. 
MO: Now this whole area isn't watered every day, 
is 
it? 
EL: No. At least once a week. 
MO: And how many acres did you say this is? 
O'Connor--85 Audiocassette logs 
page 137 
EL: This whole thing? 
MO: Uh—huh. 
EL: There's 55 here. 
MO: I mean -- I'm sorry -- the cucumbers. 
EL: Seventeen. 
MO: Uh—huh. So 
is this the end of your property here? 
EL: There's a stream that runs through there, the Great Swamp. 
MO: The Great Swamp? 
EL: This is pretty. You'll 
like this. I guess you could say I'm 
not the average person. Neither is Mary. And the way we 
live 
is 
not average either. 
MO: No. 
EL: But we're pretty happy here. 
MO: You're fortunate in a lot of ways that you inherited this. 
EL: Uh—huh. 
MO: Also, 
if you appreciate it, that helps. I'm sure a lot of 
kids wouldn't come back. Uh—huh. These things are neat. Cat 
tails? 
EL: Yeah. Now here's something that we saw a lot of people 
picking, you know, that they make things with and sell them, 
sell 
them to florists. Do people come on your land and pick 
them? 
MO: No, but Mary went to cut some. When we had the farm market 
last year at Linwood, she wanted to cut some and sell them out 
there. She said, "I know you can get 50 cents apiece -- you 
might even get a dollar apiece for them." 
MO: You're kidding? 
EL: Yeah. Some people probably would pay a buck apiece for them. 
MO: That's a lot of money. You've got a lot of dollars sitting 
right here 
in cat tails. 
EL: Crazy, 
isn't it? 
MO: Yep. 
EL: 
I'm going to take you down a little trail now. 
MO: All 
right. Alligators or what? 
EL: Let me make sure I'm 
in the right spot. Don't come 
in. 
MO: Poison ivy? 
EL: I want to make sure I'm 
in the right spot. 
MO: All 
right. Part of the trumpet flower? These flowers sure 
are pretty. The thorns are nasty though. (Recording 
interruption.) 
MO: Should have brought the camera. Boy, this 
is beautiful. How 
big 
is this place? 
EL: This 
is pretty big. 
It gets even bigger when you get down 
the street, where the lake 
is. 
MO: Yeah. I saw that in the car the other day. 
EL: Yeah. 
MO: A lot of birds, huh? 
EL: Pretty incredible place. There' a lot to see back here. I 
don't know if you'd be 
interested in tearing through the woods 
or not. But there's some real nice trails. 
MO: I would like to. 
EL: Take the camera here. 
MO: Yeah. I've got to come back again. This isn't enough time 
O'Connor--85 Audiocassette logs 
page 138 
just to come a couple of times 
EL: Like I told you, you could spend a whole day 
Trying to do 
it 
in one hour is totally impossible. 
MO: Yeah. To try to do 
it 
in one day 
is probably impossible. 
What kind of animals do you see back here? 
EL: All kinds of fish, beaver, maybe an occasional possum. 
MO: A lot of birds, too, huh? 
EL: Dragonflies, a lot of birds. It's pretty clean, for the most 
part. I mean, 
it's not polluted or nothing. 
MO: Do you go fishing? 
EL: Yesterday, yeah. 
MO: What did you catch? 
EL: Pike, catfish, whatever, bass. 
MO: Really? 
EL: Yeah. 
MO: That's pretty amazing. 
EL: Turtles. 
MO: So this connects to the 
little lake up there? 
EL: Yeah, that's the stream. 
MO: And where does the stream originate? 
EL: The stream -- oh, somewhere down past Winslow, out to 
Brassborough, (PHONETIC) I guess, somewhere out that way I'd 
like to take you back there, but you don't have a camera. It 
would probably be better when you come back next time. 
MO: Yeah. 
EL: There's a hill there you can stand on inside. It's really 
pretty. It 
looks over the whole swamp. 
MO: Your 15 acres 
is 
on the other side? 
EL: The other side, yeah. That's real 
pretty. I can't believe 
how much it's grown up. 
MO: That's kind of nice, that you just let 
it grow like that. 
EL: Yeah. 
MO: So can you get a boat in there? 
EL: A canoe. 
MO: A canoe? 
EL: A canoe, yeah. 
MO: That would be fun. 
EL: A raft, a log, 
inner tube. 
MO: Snakes 
in there too? 
EL: I imagine there's water snakes. They don't bother you 
though. They have their own food to eat. I don't think they want 
you rs . 
MO: Uh—huh. 
EL: I don't think they consider you to be food. It's just 
adapting to one crawling up along side of you. 
MO: Right. Just saying, "Hey, we can share this space. No 
problem." (Laughter.) 
EL: See those trees up there? 
MO: Yeah. 
EL: That's where my property is. 
MO: So that's there 
in the swamp, right? 
EL: Those are the trees, yeah. 
MO: Dead stalk? 
O'Connor--85 Audiocassette logs 
page 139 
EL: That's where I want to put a house. 
MO: Oh, really? Right next to the swamp? 
EL: 
In the trees, yeah. I want to put a house --
MO: Oh, I was looking at these dead trees. You mean that kind of 
row of trees over there. 
EL: Right. 
MO: Hey, that's a nice spot. 
EL: House 
in the treetops, I call 
it. 
MO: Yeah, sounds good. Are you going to build 
it way up high? 
EL: Way up high, yeah, 
like a tree house. 
MO: That's great. Robinson Curuso 
EL: (Inaudible). 
MO: Yeah. Skylight? 
EL: Skylight, big glass front window the whole (inaudible). 
MO: Yeah, passive solar, kind of. 
EL: (Inaudible). 
MO: I used to build those kind. 
EL: Did you? 
MO: Yeah. 
EL: 
I'm interested in some kits now, some literature for some 
kits. Look at that duck. 
MO: Hey, fabulous. 
EL: Isn't this a wild place? 
MO: 
It's great. 
EL: This is heaven for me. 
MO: I mean, having a swamp, there's so much happening all 
the 
time. 
EL: All 
the time, every season. You should see it when the ducks 
fly south, when they come in? It's beautiful. The geese, when 
they fly overhead. It's really an 
incredible place. Mary doesn't 
realize that she has so much here because she's from 
Lawrenceville and Manhattan, Princeton. You know, her coming 
down here was like a big for her, you know? It's only until 
now 
she's starting to appreciate what's really here. 
MO: She's talked a lot about the swamp. 
EL: Yeah. She's starting to appreciate it now. But before, 
it 
was just like a bunch of dirty weeds to her. 
MO: I guess it takes a long time --
EL: To understand it 
MO: -- to understand it, 
yeah. I'm sure I don't understand it. I 
have a little idea 
EL: (Inaudible) those trees, 
looking back this way, this being 
the front view of the house. You look back and you see the farm 
the buildings up there where that tree is? See, we're down 
in 
the valley now. 
MO: Right. 
EL: See that tree? 
MO: Uh — 
huh 
EL: That's where the farm is, 
back there, and you look back at 
the whole property , the swamp and the trees and the property. 
It's a really beautiful spot. I just hope I make some money this 
year, so I can do 
it 
MO: Will you be able to build on this?

I'm going to try, try saying it's something for something. 
MO: Call 
it a farm building or something? 
EL: Something like that, yeah. I should be able to get away with 
at least one room, a one— room, one—bedroom, house. 
MO: Yeah. 
EL: There's another 
MO: 
If you need any 
seen a lot of those 
EL: Oh yeah? Great, 
MO: 
I've been involved in

EL: No kidding? 
MO: Yeah. 
MO: That's great. 
EL: That's what I used to do for a living for a few years. 
MO: Uh—huh. There's a whole place called Shelter Institute up 
in 
Maine and they basically you know build passive solar houses 
with owners who wanted to build them, you know, by kind of 
showing the owners how to do their own work. So we're in another 
cucumber field? How many acres 
is this? 
EL: This is about three and a half. These are -- I think the 
variety of cucumber is called Market More (PHONETIC) and the 
variety of peach is called Norman. The peaches should have a 
crop next year. They should get a box to a tree. There's roughly 
400 trees in here so times $10.00, that would be $4,000.00. But 
you have to wait three years for it. 
MO: Yeah. 
EL: So 
in the meantime, y 
cukes. If

The first

MO: And yo 
EL: Right. 
MO: 
It's interesting the way the cukes are -- you have two rows 
between each row of trees and then between each tree, you have a 
row running between . 
EL: 
(Inaudible). The reason why is becaus e, 
if you remember 
correctly, that block was over ther 
the rows were running 
the other way. 
MO: Yeah, right. 
EL: Okay. The trees are wider this way than they are this way. 
They're narrow this way. So (inaudible). 
MO: Yeah. This is the 22—foot, right 
EL: So we had that orchard over there 
this gets confusing now 
-- we had that orchard over there -- 
MO: 
In the distance, yeah. 
EL: -- in the distance, running the same way that these rows are 
running. So we figured, 
let's run the cucumber rows the other 
way, so 
if we have to irrigate, we can irrigate the whole thing, 
this and that together. (Inaudible) basically that if we have to

O'Connor--85 Audiocassette logs 
page 141 
put water on those trees up there, which are dying, we'll start 
from one end and go right down the row. 
MO: So there's a lot of dying trees here all 
the time. 
EL: Uh—huh. 
MO: So out of 55 acres of trees, how many acres do you figure 
are dying each year? 
EL: Seven percent. 
MO: That doesn't sound too bad actually. 
EL: 
(Inaudible) have to replace them. 
MO: Do you buy trees that are already growing or do you grow 
them --
EL: Uh—uh. Buy them from a nursery. 
MO: Where's that? 
EL: Ringoes, New Jersey. That's right by the farming dale. I 
guess it would be north of Trenton about an hour. 
MO: And they supply you with all 
ten varieties, huh? 
EL: Yeah. 
MO: Are they the main supplier for everybody around? 
EL: No. There are quite a few nurseries scattered all 
over the 
place. 
MO: Uh—huh. 
EL: 
It's just that we used to deal with them a long time ago, 
and we're still dealing with them and they're pretty reputable. 
They'll make good, 
if there's anything bad. 
MO: That's good. 
EL: 
If they have a bad shipment of trees and they don't crop 
right the first year and they die, they'll replace the whole 
lot. They have to do 
it that way because they're in competition 
with so many other people. 
MO: Sure. How old 
is the tree when you get it? 
EL: One year. 
MO: And what is 
it? About 12 inches? 
EL: Oh, about three feet? 
EL: But it's real skimpy. That tree there is two years old, so 
it's real skimpy. Remember I was telling you about that 
(inaudible)? 
MO: Yeah. 
EL: I showed you that microshield and I said that stuff's real 
expensive. If you don't spray, you'll get it, 
that's it. 
MO: Those black spots all 
over it. 
EL: The reason why he's got it 
is because he didn't spray the 
trees, and there's no fruit on the trees. So he's not going to 
bother spraying. That's what bacterial spot looks like. 
MO: And --
EL: That's a reject. 
MO: Yeah. Does that hurt the taste? 
EL: No. 
MO: That's just the looks. 
EL: 
It's a blemish. But as far as the average housewife, that's 
a no—no. So you can't put that one into a $15.00 box. 
MO: Can you sell those at all? 
EL: Yeah, as seconds. 
MO: Do you sell anything to processors of peaches? 
O'Connor--85 Audiocassette logs 
page 142 
EL: Uh—huh, that. 
MO: Oh, I see. The seconds go to people who put them in canned 
peaches and stuff like that? 
EL: Uh—huh. 
MO: Who are they? 
EL: Mrs. Smith's, Ocean Spray, whoever. 
MO: Uh—huh. Are you a member of Ocean Spray? 
EL: No. 
MO: They just buy them from you? 
EL: 
If they're looking for peaches for certain mix, peaches and 
cranberries, they'll buy from here. 
MO: Oh, I see. So you're pretty much able to get rid of 
everything? 
EL: Oh, no problem. The problem is having enough to pick. 
MO: Right. 
EL: As you can see, these trees should be loaded. There's 
nothing on these guys, and these guys are very sparse. 
MO: Yeah, they do 
look sparse. Up until now, they really didn't 
look this sparse. Most of them had more on them. 
EL: Yeah, he's got 30 percent, just like I say. Here he's got 
nothing. 
MO: So is this the 
last area of cucumbers in this row? 
EL: Yes. 
MO: They're four years old or something? 
EL: Three 
MO: Three years old. 
EL: See, this is supposed to be the bang—up year, 
is when you 
get the cukes in there, and you get the peaches on the tree at 
the same time. 
MO: 5,000 in each category? 
EL: Yeah. 
MO: Yeah. 
EL: You should definitely make a few thousand dollars profit 
from that acre. 
MO: That's terrible. 
EL: You should make $2,000.00 profit from that acre, and the 
only thing he's seeing 
is . Maybe he's going to break even. 
MO: The trees look pretty good—sized 
EL: Because he's got the cukes in there, he might make $500.00 
an acre profit, maybe. 
MO: Yeah. 
EL: But that's a maybe, because you don't know what your cukes 
are going to do. They could do $5.00. 
MO: Do all 
peach farmers grow cucumbers? 
EL: No. Most peach farmers don't bother with it. They just have 
enough ground where they can stick the tree in the ground and 
wait. 
If 
it bears, 
it bears 
if 
it doesn't, 
it doesn't. They've 
got money coming in from some other source 
MO: What's enough ground? 
EL: Anywhere between 50 to a hundred acres. 
MO: So you're kind of on the lower end of that spectrum? 
EL: We're on the 65, 70 spectrum 
MO: Do you think you'll keep buying more land? 
O'Connor--85 Audiocassette logs 
page 143 
EL: Yeah. I would like to get to be 85, 90 acres. I think any 
more than a hundred is too much and anything less than 70 isn't 
enough. Anywhere between 70 to a hundred. 
MO: Do you figure you can cover your losses with enough acres? 
EL: We didn't cover the whole farm. I just covered part of 
it. 
MO: Yeah. 
EL: Like I said, you could spend all day out here. 
MO: Yeah. 
EL: And every orchard and every field has its own different 
thing, see? 
Now coming up here, you've got the road, this is 
Pine Road (PHONETIC), a pretty nice road, you know, especially 
-- you've been on 
it and you've been driving up and down. You 
see the other farms. Most of 
it's kept well around here. There's 
nothing shabby or rundown about the farms. They're meticulous, 
the way they . 
MO: 
It really 
is true. Yeah, I took some pictures of some of the 
other farm buildings on Pine Road, to get a feel for the whole 
road. I know one thing I wanted to ask you about Pine Road, 
there are Italian farms. Do Italian farmers farm a certain way 
that has anything to do with being Italian that's different 
from, say, German farmers or anything? 
EL: Italian farmers, I think, 
like to see trees, and olive 
trees, or peach trees 
MO: A gnarly tree like that? 
EL: Some kind of a gnarly, European growing—looking tree, and 
the ground's flat, you know, and has some kind of rolling 
landscape to 
it, and I think it does resemble Italy somewhat, 
northern Italy and central Italy and I guess that's why -- you 
know, because they're from that area, they have this feeling 
towards farming. 
MO: I didn't go to many other farms, but I went to the Saul 
(PHONETIC)farm, and they were growing one crop, too, but I think 
it's potatoes, maybe sweet potatoes. I think potato potatoes 
though, but I'm not sure. But you folks used to grow sweet 
potatoes too. 
EL: Yeah. We were sweet potato giants at one time. (Laughter.) 
That was only one building we had to keep sweet potatoes in. 
MO: Oh, really? 
EL: 
In different parts of , yeah. 
MO: Oh, my gosh. So you rented out land 
in other places? 
EL: Rented out land and buildings. 
MO: Were you involved in that? 
EL: I was a kid, yeah. 
MO: Just a kid? 
EL: Yeah. That's where I got kind of discouraged because it was 
too big. You know, 
it was everything we had here, plus a hell of 
a I 
of more, that wasn't here. — 
MO: You're talking like a couple hundred acres? 
EL: Three. 
MO: Three hundred? 
EL: 310 acres, yeah. 
MO: Wow. 
EL: And this 
is only 55 here. 
O'Connor--85 Audiocassette logs 
page 144 
MO: Uh—huh. 
EL: And you see how big this 
is. 
MO: How much did we see? Thirty of 
it? 
EL: About 30 of 
it, 
yeah. So 300 acres 
is ten times that much. 
That's a lot for, you know on or two guys. 
MO: 
Is this yours over here too? 
EL: Yeah. 
MO: And that's tomatoes. Oh, you've got lots of tomatoes. 
EL: Yeah, take a look at them. 
MP. Wow. Now are you going to have to stake all 
those? 
EL: 
It's funny you mentioned that. I was thinking about it. 
MO: We're talking a lot of tying up. 
MO: They should develop a low—bush tomato 
EL: This 
is. 
MO: Oh, 
is 
it? 
EL: Yeah, this 
is a determinant plant. 
MO: Oh, that's what you meant by the determinant -- it stops 
growing. 
EL: Yeah, (inaudible). That's what it 
is, a low—bush. You hit it 
right on the head. But you can still stake them. What you do 
is 
you put a stake he 
in between them and you skip every five. 
Every four or five, you put another stake here, another stake 
every four or five down the road. See these bugs? 
MO: Yeah. 
EL: 
I've got to come 
in here and spray today. That's the first 
thing I'm going to do. 
MO: You spray with the tractor? 
EL: Yeah, as soon as we're finished here, I'm going to bring the 
(inaudible). 
MO: How do you carry that? 
EL: On the back of the truck. That's the thing that orchard. 
MO: How long will 
it take you? You've got about, what? Five 
acres here or something? 
EL: Two. 
MO: Two acres. 
EL: Two acres of tomatoes. 
MO: How long will 
it take you to spray them? 
EL: Not long, about a half hour, 40 minutes. 
MO: Oh, that's not bad. 
EL: Yeah, and then you run a wire straight down and you tie them 
up. 
I've got to come 
in and spray. This is serious, this is 
really serious. 
MO: You don't want to lose your crop now. 
EL: Well, they're on the first row. I guess they're coming in 
from the outside. See those? They're in there. 
MO: Are they the same bugs? They're not, are they? 
EL: Yeah, they're soft shell bugs. 
MO: And do you have borers too underground? 
EL: Not on these. That's just on the peach trees. 
MO: So you're fighting a limited number, but a pretty solid 
number, of bugs, huh? 
EL: And of obstacles, too, the weather being the big one. Labor 
we keep that under control for the most part. You have control 
O'Connor--85 Audiocassette logs 
page 145 
of the labor If you don't want them to work, you tell them they 
can't work. If they produce, they work. So 
labor, you have 
control over. The machinery you have control over. The equipment 
gets expensive, but you keep trying to make it work. The problem 
you don't have any control over is the weather. Like I say 
everything can go good, everything can go fantastic What 
happens, there might be a hail storm tonight. You may talk to me 
next week and I won't even talk to you. (Laughter.) 
MO: 
I'll 
remember that. 
EL: Yeah, 
it's a gamble, from the time you start,until you say, 
well, I m going to farm, until the time you actually get your 
mortgage paid for the year and it's Christmas Day and New Year's 
and the day is finished. A long year. 
MO: So actually it's more than six months really. 
EL: Yeah, between the thought process and changing into things, 
it's more than a year. But your actual working time is six 
months, the time out in the field and on the farm. 
I'd like 
to do 
it 
in a way where I don't have to be here for the other 
six 
MO: Yeah, you were saying that. 
EL: Yeah, be somewhere else. 
MO: Go down to Atlantic City and make a lot of money gambling. 
EL: I tried that, that don't work. 
MO: I know. 
EL: You wind up cutting all 
this wood for nothing and giving it 
to the casino and you say, "What am I doing? I'm actually going 
through all this hard work? It doesn't make sense. 
MO: All 
right. 
EL: 
I'm definitely going to have to get on those tomatoes. 
MO: Yeah, well, I got to get on this measuring, too. 
EL: All 
right. 
MO: 
If I'm going to get done today. 
EL: What are you going to do? 
MO: Do the measured drawing of the farmland, of the buildings, 
and then -- I won't be able to do 
it for the whole orchard or 
anything, but just to give an 
idea of --
EL: Are you just drawing a map or something? 
MO: Yeah, I'm going to --
