Sunday, July 8?
 
Dearest Bess:
 
I am sending you all the correspondance about the Lomax
 
papers, and I sincerely think that we are going to be forced to take
 
concerted action unless we wish to leave all our correspondance with
 
father open to anyone who may pass by and show a little curiosity.
 
Want to write a ii tie background beofre you and Alan
 
wade into the file.
 When I was  there for the two weeks I asked re-
peatedly as I found all the eax traneous  things like the personal cheeks
 
written by mother over a couple of years for household expenses; why
 
all this junk was included.  I never could get anything like a straight
 
answer from Dr Kielman, but the younger persons who are actively working
 
with the papers and the students going through them told me thatit was
 
customary for the family to go through collections carefully and take
 
out such items as were purely personal before the papers were sent to
 
tge  archives .
 I was also told be these nice young people that each
 
of them would be glad, and interested, in getting the collection in
 
shape and catalogue ng it, but that it would probably take two years,
 
and there was no time, nor money.
 So when I asked about such definate
 
articles as a Valentine to Deanie for a tea given by the Delta Kappa
 
Gamma (honory education sorority she helped found) they had to say "No"
 
I attempted to see Dr Kielman the last two days but he was always other-
wise engaged.
 
After I returned home I wrote him three times, getting a
 
bit more forceful each letter, and I did not hear.
 Then 11 called him
 
three separate times and he was out of the office and she did not
 
return my call..
 So  when Joe called me toreport in  a franzy that he
 
could not getinto thearchives and could get no answer from Tr  Kielman
 
I suggested that I talk it over with my lawyer friend, and did.
 While
 
Bess and I were gone he called Norton Baker, and wraote him, and the
 
rest of the material is s
ell
' explanatory.
 I want definate suggestions.
 
I also have letters between Umps and Dr Kielman with
 
lovely and grandiose plans for the use of the Lomax roof, none of which
 
of course went any further.
 My reaction is to close the damn things
 
for fifty years, and then none of us were sure to caret
 
Bess, darling, I do miss lou so much.
 i got the picturss
 
we took, the first roll, and sent off for copies,  sent Mr Abrahams the'
 
ones for the three buildings, and the mountain.
 Sorry the things are
 
fuzzy, could it Le my little box, many years old, shoülk be re-
placed?
 I also have the seeds for Rudoipha and for Merit, and
 
Tuesday when I get more pictures will write to Hyacintg and get
 
them off.
 I have not found the seeds that Mrs Maynard wants .
 
Lisa came in yesterday and last night I had tickets for
 
a play at Tech, had read duch good reviews that I thought we must
 
go and it turnead out to be very good "Charlie Brown" with all the
 
Peanuts characters.
 I reaommend it for all.
 We have tickets for
 
The Ringling Circus next week end.
 Lisa seems sweet as
 
content as far as I can tell to be here, and helpful and
 
have not started in on trying to find out wha sis in her
 
ever, very
 
sassy.
 I
 
mind about
 
school or next year, she is definately pleased with her choice of UT
 
and had a good experience with her clinic work in Dallas during June.
 
I got mad about my pants being too tight around the wiast
 
and started in determinedly on a diet, picked the Scarsdale one and
 
it suits me fine.
 I can look ahead and find the things I will have
 
the next few days and getthem on hand.
 And it was high time that I
 
quit the dependance on liquor at night, I have really not missed it,
 
have drunk gallons of "sun" tea and even managed to find out that I
 
can stomach Wiet pepsi.
 I am down eight pounds and am determined to
 
make it fifteen, also the swimming every day must really help to tone.
 
Wish  ou might join mein this lovely outdoor pool,  only a mile and a
 
half from me.
 My knees are not bothering me at all, have just come
 
in (
its Monday) from nearly three hours in the flower beds andthe
 
garden and even got down and edged some, its funny, the grass slippers
 
won/t cut with the lefthand so I do it with my right and seems to me
 
I have to do less of moving the right with the left-- right now I am
 
on the upswing ax psychologicially and things seems better.
 
At the gvvcery store  Saturday I saw  he headlines on the
 
"Enquirer" something about arthritis and Ialways buy those with that
 
subject or diet, and when I read the article I thought It had some
 
valuable information, the name of a place in N. H. and some plain
 
good suggestions besidesthe fact thatthe tone was optomistic.
 
My new clothes have cut a swath with one and all, also had
 
my hair cut shorter, and it no longer hangsin my forhead and that's
 
complicated too.
 Did you get that lady in the I
guilding Jane told
 
me about to alter the hemline on the sleeveless dress, now do it right
 
this minute,
 ou can do it in thirty minutes.
 
Have been looking for stuff to furnish the middle room and
 
priced Ethan Allen love seats with hâdabeds at $700
 and found one in
 
the pser for $300
 that looks good as new,  si thrilled
 
I haven't broached Lisa on the quitting school thing, will
 
report when we talk that out.
 I should be having a report soon on
 
Susan and the Smallins and the trip to Denver last week, Susan was to
 
leave for a week's camping trip with the 14
—H girls two hours after she
 
landed in San Jowe •
 If I didn't tell you about the Seeing-Eye  progam
 
Kirsh isin volvedin now remind methe next time we talk.

Dear Mr.  Billings:
 
We represent Shirley L. Mansell,  one of  the daughters of  John A. Lomax,
 
as well as other heirs of Mr.  Lomax.
 
Joseph F. Lomax has  tried  to contact you,  and perhaps others have
 
contacted you but have not received  the information that they desire
 
with regard to  the Lomax Archives which are housed at  the University
 
of Texas.
 
It would be appreciated if you would respond  to  the following questions
 
at your earliest convenience:
 
Under what conditions does the University continue to hold
 
the papers of  the late John A. Lomax?
 Please furnish us
 
copies of  instruments,  if any,  which would purport to
 
convey such papers to  the University.
 
From the University's  standpoint,  do  the heirs of  the late
 
John A. Lomax have the right to remove materials contained
 
in the archives which were a part of  the papers of  the
 
late John A. Lomax?
 You may know that  some of  these
 
materials are highly person. l  in nature and Mrs. Mansell
 
feels  that these. personal  items should be removed and not
 
left there for possible public  scrutiny.
 
In the event there is no document conveying  these papers
 
to the University,  we would like  to  know the correct
 
procedure for  so doing  in the event the heirs desire to
 
confirm the gift.
 
In the event the heirs would not be  interested in making
 
a gift of  the papers,  would  the University or  the Humanities
 
Research Center be interested in purchasing  the papers?
 
At the present time who currently  has access to  these papers?

Dear Mr.  Baker:
 
June 4,  1979
 
I have been called in from my personal vacation to respond to your
 
letter of May 30,  1979,  relating to the John A.  Lomax Papers.
 I have
 
had a draft of a letter to Mr.  Joseph Lomax on my desk pending comple-
tion the past three weeks much of which time I was out of town.
 This
 
letter was in response to several discussions I had with Mr.  Lomax
 
by telephone regarding this gift made to The University in 1948.
 
I first talked to Mr.  Lomax on March 9,  1979,  after I understood he
 
had not had any response to earlier inquiries directed to the Barker
 
Texas History Center.
 At that time I asked Dr.  Chester Kielman,  Li-
brarian/Archivist of the Barker Center to search the Center's files
 
for information relating to the Lomax gift.
 His response to me is
 
attached.
 Since this information apparently did not provide the facts
 
needed to resolve Mr.  Lomax's questions I called Mr.  Lomax on April  H
 
and told him we would look further among the old gift files to see
 
what additional  information might be found.
 This search resulted in
 
the location of copies of the attached documents which I was preparing
 
to send Mr.  Lomax.
 I cannot find the original letters and presume
 
they are probably in the Board of Regents'  office or possibly in the
 
Development Office.
 
In any event,  it is clear that the John A.  Lomax Papers were given
 
to The University by John A.  Lomax and Ruby Terrill Lomax in 1947-48.
 
Mr.  Lomax's letter of 7/17/1947 to Miss Winnie Allen,  University Ar-
chivist,  reads:
 
'
We've grown tired looking for you to come back.
 Through
 
August no one will be at home,  so only you and Henry will
 
be around if you have planned to come then.
 
"I have decided to give The University of Texas all my
 
papers except those referring to the Ballads.
 But they
 
need the arranging that you were giving them.
 
"I hope you are well and happy.
 
"Yours a
 Iways ,
 John A.  lomax
 
Mr
 Norton Baker

 Page 2
 
You will see Miss Allen's response of July 22,  1947,  and her acknow-
ledgement of the gilt to Mrs.  Lomax dated March 25,  1948,  in which
 
she says,  "It is agreed that these papers be used for biographical
 
purposes only with the authorization of the heirs," and the heirs
 
are then listed.
 These letters tie directly to the Archives records
 
dated March 18,  1948,  and March 22,  1948,  also attached.
 
Thus,  it appears to me that these papers have been university prop-
erty since 1948,  and as state property none can be returned to any
 
heir.
 As  I understand it,  the practice in the University Archives
 
has been to restrict access to the biographical documents to only
 
those persons given permission by the heirs,  and that has only been
 
one or two persons  in the past twenty years.
 
The University has long benefited by a cordial  relationship with the
 
Lomax family including important subsequent gifts of other material.
 
I look forward to continuing this mutually beneficial relationship.
 
If there are legal problems you see that need to be resolved I sug-
gest you contact the University General Counsel.
 If I can assist
 
in any other practical way please let me know.
 
Sincerely,
 
Harold W.  Billings

The holding record, in addition t
o the letters noted above, also
 
contains a manuscript receipt memorandum dated March 18, 1948,
 
a copy of which is attached.  The only other record of this type
 
is an inventory sheet dated March 2

also attached.
 
Among the later letters in the holding record only one seems to
 
be relevant to the present questions.  Dated October 4
, 1949, from
 
Miss Allen to Mrs. Lomax, this letter states that the collection
 
is ready for microfilming.  There are no other records relating
 
to microfilming.

Dear Mr..  Billings:
 
TELEPHONE
 
806-763-7385
 
Thank you for your letter of June 4,  1979 regarding the John A. Lomax
 
papers.
 
I have talked with Shirley Mansell who is the oldest daughter of
 
Mr. Lomax and she advises that this was the first
, time that she had
 
seen the information that you sent me with your letter.
 
Mrs. Mansell advises that the family would like to have the personal
 
letters written by Mr.  Lomax to them and vice versa, old checkbooks
 
that are in the Lomax papers, along with other similar personal items.
 
We do not contemplate any legal problem involved in this and would
 
appreciate your advising if the above request is satisfactory.
 
Thank you for your assistance in this matter.
 
Very truly yours,

Dear Mr.  Baker:
 
I
'm sure you realize the havoc that would ensue among our
 
many,  many collections of private papers  in the University
 
Archives should various  family members decide to retrieve
 
materials previously donated years after The University had
 
accepted such gifts.
 
It seems to me that Mr.  John A.  Lomax and Mrs.  Ruby Terrill
 
Lomax donated these family papers with the wish and realiza-
tion that The University would care for them in perpetuity.
 
Mrs.  Shirley Mansell's personal privacy was assured by the
 
agreement  that the heirs would control access to the papers
 
for biographical use.
 
I hope this reassurance of privacy to Mrs.  Mansell will allay
 
her concerns over this material which has belonged to the
 
State of Texas  for over thirty years.
 
Sincerely,

Dear Ms. Hawes:
 
January 8
, 1982
 
This is my belated follow-through to the promise I made you in November
 
regarding the state of the Lomax Papers at the U
.T. Archives.
 I apologize for
 
taking so long.
 
Enclosed is a copy of the card file from the U.T. Archives, with my
 
notations.  All of the numbers circled in red denote boxes of materials which
 
are currently "restricted."  This means that everything in the boxes is
 
inaccessible, even if only part of the  contents were considered sensitive at
 
the time the restrictions were made.  The numbers marked with a red arrow
 
were restricted only this summer, and I am unsure whether they were supposed
 
to be restricted earlier or not.
 
Below are listed the materials from the various restricted boxes which
 
I think could be of scholarly value, and do not appear to contain sensitive
 
items.
 Of course my estimations are based mostly on guesses made by looking
 
at these cards.
 
Box number
 Folders  (
I assume that each of the items listed on
 
a card is arranged separately in the box)

. Clippings Concerning Death of John A. Lomax, 1948
 
I have also underlined the listed items on the enclosed sheets, and noted in
 
the margin the scholarly value they might have.
 
As you can see, the restrictions as they stand are inconsistent, and it
 
would probably help a great deal to rewrite them.  Of course to do so would be
 
rather difficult without some direct attention from your family.  As I said
 
in San Antonio, I think that the Archive people would be happy to set up a
 
new arrangement, though of course I have no authority to speak for them.
 
Barring such a solution, I will venture to request your permission to examine
 
the folders listed above, excluding the other materials in the boxes.
 You would
 
still have control over any publication rights.
 
Please understand that, aside from my own personal request, the disposition
 
of the papers outlined here is only a suggestion, and Ido not wish to interfere
 
in any way with things that are rightfully the decision of your family.
 
I also want to clarify the nature of my own work.  The history of folklore,
 
not personal biography, is my aim.
 I say this because the question came up
 
in my conversations with Shirley and, if my memory is correct, with you.  As
 
evidence I enclose also a copy of the prospectus for my dissertation.
 
After all this seriousness, I will conclude by saying that I enjoyed
 
seeing you again in San Antonio--and hearing you and Hally and Joe sing--
and I hope that my part in this matter will help things rather than hinder.
 
I look forward to hearing from you.
 
Sincerely,
 
/
 
'
Jim
  McNutt
 
P
.S.
 I am sending this only to you for now, but I will be happy to duplicate
 
the materials for other members of your family if you desire.

McNutt, p
.  2
 
mediated between his fellow Texas folklorists and the theoretical
 
folklorists who dominated the field by the 1960s.
 
It is possible to explore the significance of Lomax, Dobie,
 
and Boatright for the development of a regional consciousness on
 
three levelsi  personal, institutional, and professional.  On the
 
personal level, the similarities of their early lives, their
 
intellectual training, and the impact of experiences outside the
 
region offer valuable prospects for investigation.  On the
 
institutional level, their fights to gain recognition from the
 
University of Texas, as well as their relations with its controllers,
 
may have affected their thinking about the region itself.  The
 
various institutions they encountered outside the University were
 
importatn, too, in helping them define their objectives; Lomax,
 
for example, began collecting songs from Negro prisoners in the
 
belief that the prisons created a sheltered "folk" community which
 
would produce music untarnished by the overindustrialized modern
 
world.
 Finally, on the professional level, the need to define
 
themselves as regional authorities, yet remain free of academic or
 
"scientific" pretensions, led them to make a number of intellectual
 
compromises which may prove to be the most important elements in
 
the development of their thought.
 
A number of more specific questions also present themselves.
 
1)  Why should folklore suddenly become important in Texas at the
 
turn of the century?  On an individual level, certain circumstances
 
undoubtedly influenced Lomax, Dobte, and Boatright to take up folklore
 
in the first place; but on the cultural level, why should the region
 
McNutt, p
.  3
 
produce them?  Numerous other regions of the United States
 
possessed the stuff of folklore in abundance, yet in Texas folklore
 
developed as a scholarly concern with particular rapidity; with
 
the exception of the brief-lived Missouri Folklore Society (1906-
1920), the Texas Folklore Society (1909) was the first state
 
organization formed after the American Folklore Society itself (1888).
 
2)  How did these men participate in and/or react to the increasing
 
professionaltzation of scholarship in general and folklore in
 
particular?  How did they perceive the function of the Texas
 
Folklore Society in which they played such prominent parts?
 
3)  What was their relationship to the institution where they
 
carried on a great deal of their work--The University of Texas?
 
How did their studies and travels outside of Texas affect their
 
thinking?  Lomax spent a crucial year at Harvard, where he met
 
Barrett Wendell and George Lyman Kittredge; Dobie spent a year at
 
Columbia (which was inconsequential in his later view), and taught
 
at Cambridge University during World War II (where he was apparently
 
of less consequence than he thought himself); Boatright remained at
 
the University of Texas after 1926, and never studied outside the
 
state.  What are the relative merits of these experiences?
 
4)  How did Lomax, Dobie, and Boatright perceive the "folk" of
 
Texas?  Each of them achieved recognition for work with particular
 
occupational and ethnic groupss
 Lomax with cowboys and blacks,
 
Dobie with cowboys and
 xiean-Americans, Boatright with oil workers.
 
Did their work reflect the realities of these groups, or did it
 
merely promote a mainstream Anglo-American cultural vision?  Dobie
 
McNutt, p. 4
 
was fond of criticizing the Hollywood version of the cowboy, for
 
instance, and sought to replace it with a more realistic  represen-
tation; yet later Texas writers have accused him and his fellow
 
folklorists of bowdlerizing their accounts of the cowboy.  And
 
without doubt their attitudes toward non-Anglo ethnic groups are
 
uncomfortably condescending at times.
 
5)  Of equal significance to their perception of the "folk" is the
 
manner in which these men sought to preserve the values they saw
 
in the folk; all were frankly and consciously romantic, and aware
 
of their shared affinities with Herder and Scott.
 Yet their
 
frankness itself perhaps obscured some of the effects of their
 
romanticism.  The question of religious values is a revealing
 
example.  The Texas folklorists grew up in an atmosphere of strict
 
rural Protestant religious practice, exemplified by church-going,
 
camp meetings, family Bible readings, and abstinence from liquor
 
and dancing.  Although they abandoned these practices soon after
 
they left home, their work tended to reaffirm the Protestant values
 
of their parents--hard work, thrift, and straightforward devotion
 
to church pieties.
 By collecting play-party songs, hymns, and
 
sermons, which they frequently admired as evidence of regional folk
 
roots, and by encouraging others to do so, they created respect for
 
the spirit, if not the letter, of their parents' religion.
 It was
 
necessary somehow for them to reinvest the energy their parents had
 
put into religious practice, a characteristic shared with turn-of-
the-century Progressives who had to work through the confrontation
 
of nineteenth-century ideals with twentieth-century realities in
 
McNutt, p.  5
 
personal terms.  Quite possibly the attempt of the Texas folklorists
 
to come to terms with religious values was a basic motivation for
 
them to seek, in Dobie's words, to portray people "out of the old
 
rock" and "realms of the spirit."
 
6)  Finally, what has been the effect of their work, and how have
 
folklorists responded to it?  A definite split took place in the
 
early 1970s between the theoretical folklorists who had come to
 
the University of Texas during the 60s and the older generation who
 
wanted to continue the ways of Lomax, Dobie, and Boatright.  The
 
Texas Folklore Society even moved its quarters from Austin to
 
Nacogdoches.  Yet professionalized theoretical folklore has not
 
triumphed completely, and in any case it cannot forego the intellec-
tual inheritance provided by regionally oriented innovators like
 
the Texas folklorists.
 
Source Materials
 
A wealth of cource materials are available for this study,
 
the major portion of them located in the Archives and the Humanities
 
Research Center at the University of Texas at Austin.
 These include
 
the John A. Lomax Papers, the J
. Frank Dobte Papers, the Mody
 
Boatright Papers, and the Records of the Texas Folklore Society,
 
as well as a variety of materials on the history of the University
 
and Texas culture.  The Texas State Archives at Austin should also
 
be of some benefit.
 
Outside the state are a number of resources which should be
 
investigated as well:
 the Harvard University Archives for inf
 or-
McNutt, p
.  6
 
mation on Lomax's Harvard career; the Columbia University Rare
 
Books and Manuscripts Library for information on Dobie's year there;
 
and the Smithsonian Institution and the Archive of Folk Song of
 
the
 
and
 
Library of Congress for materials relating to
 
the collections of songs he deposited there.
 
Interviews with numerous people who knew and
 
Lomax's work
 
worked with
 
Lomax, Dobie, and Boatright will round out the research.
 I have
 
already conducted several, and am seeking more at the present time.
 
Schedule of Work
 
Since beginning work last February, I have completed a review
 
of the Lomax Papers, the Records of the Texas Folklore Society,
 
and a portion of the Dobie Papers (which are quite extensive,
 
running to more than 250 boxes of letters and manuscripts).
 I
 
hope to complete work in the Dobie papers this spring, and finish
 
the Boatright Papers before the middle of the summer.
 My teaching
 
duties as an Assistant Instructor (
six semester hours) may
 
interfere with this schedule, however.
 
In March I plan a trip to Cambridge, Mass., New York City,
 
and Washington, D.C. to look at the sources there and conduct
 
interviews with Lomax family members.
 I will also go the meeting
 
of the Texas Folklore Society at Denton, Texas, in April.
 
If the research portion of the study is complete by mid-summer,
 
I intend to devote the remainder of the summer and the fall sem'ster
 
to writing the dissertation.

Dear Ms. Hawes:
 
June 3
, 1981
 
I
s
 
Thank you very much for taking the time to see me last Wednesday.
 
I hope we will be able to meet again when the budget is fatter for
 
folk artists--but I certainly don't want to wait until that happens.
 
I have the following to report from my research at Harvard.  The
 
Registrar's school records contains 1) a letter from David F. Houston
 
detailing your father's course work at U.T.; 2) the application to the
 
Harvard Graduate School; 3) a grade report; and 4) a letter from
 
George Lyman Kittredge explaining that your father qualifies for the
 
M.A. without having taken his exams due to illness.  As we suspected,
 
there was little to be found.
 
I did find, however, 20 or 25 letters by or concerning your father
 
in the ballad scrapbooks of George Lyman Kittredge in the Harvard
 
Archives.  None were astounding, but they do fill out the record, and
 
as far as I know, none of them are included in the Lomax Papers
 
at U.T.
 
Unfortunately I did not locate your father's class paper on
 
cowboy songs for Barrett Wendell, but I have hopes of turning it up
 
eventually.
 It would certainly be an important document, both for
 
your father's career and for folklore studies.
 
I called Holly Cutting-Baker while I was in Washington, and she
 
was open and helpful, pointing me particularly to "Miss Terrill's"
 
field notes.
 
Once again let me thank you for your help.
 I will continue to
 
keep you posted on my research.
 If I can answer any questions or
 
reciprocate in any fashion, please don't hesitate to contact me.
 
Sincerely,
 
Jim McNutt

Second, my portrayal of your father i  am  thich stresses n
i
 devot ian to
 
lack lore, partly by documenting his early concern for it--with Nat, wit
-li t

sLudents at Prairie View A & M ,  and so on.  My overall concern is with regieua
am,
 
and since I am not doing a biography, I treat John Lomax's ever-increasint
 
attention to black materials as a map of his path out of his region.  Your
 
statement that "He pursued his discoveries about Texas Negroes all across
 
the South" thus seems particularly appropriate to me.
 In light of this,
 I
 
do not think it wrong to quote him using the term "nigger."  Not to do so
 
would appear to be avoiding the issue, which I think contemporary audiences
 
would ballyhoo.  The particular instance which I quote (
the letter to Kitt

reason.

as we l

 I view his coming to grips with
 
his regional inheritance as a triumph, not a failure.  Authenticity wa$ his
 
concern.
 One motivation for my work has been the feeling that previous
 
a
itacks on his composite versions of songs are narrow and short-sighted,
 
that people need to know more about the complex development of his work.
 I
t
 
is time to listen to the records--but people won't do so as long as they are
 
JL)wed to dismiss collectors like your father for having embraced the wro l
l th
ory.
 
On this basis I am requesting permission for publication of the materials
 
in my dissertation, which will initially be in microfilm form.
 I do hope
 
to make it into a book in the next year, but I will doubtless revise and polish
 
it  further.
 In any case,
 I would not quote the materials you question w i t h o u
 
permission, though I hope you will grant the request as it stands.
 I am

Dear Mr. McNutt,
 
I apolo 6ize for taking so dreadfully long in getting back to you.
 I come
 
home every night to face what seems sometimes like a totally hopeless task,
 
even beginning t
o keep up with the torrents of paper that pour into this
 
apartmcnt.
 I barely have the energy to rea - i
t all, much less respond.
 
Alan sent me a copy of his letter to you.
 I believe he
 right about
 
the rape scene and the lynching (
don't know where that wonLi have fit in,
 
anyway?) and the tern "nigger'.  It no lDcLger :eais what i
t i
reant when father
 
was yo
n, a
rd it i
s a "buzz" word.
 I actatlly find  i
ysei I surprised at
 
the nuiber of time  father used the term "biac]
'"; I recall that word being
 
considered much more hostile (
during my childhood) than "nigger" which was
 
informal and friendly d
:ca
 n
:Jer appropriite circumstances, of course
 
(
e.g. a
i10ng social peers, black and white).
 I
t was never used to an older
 
black  :

and it was an important step in my growing up,  s
ince it was taken or my own
 
and I don't believe I ever spoke of it to anyone. Well, I don't know why I
'm
 
getting so garrulous...
 
Alan's othe  co'ncnts are well taken, i
t
. seers to x
ie, but ray not be pertinent
 
to the thesis that you are writiu .
 I wouldn't worry over then too nuch unless
 
they are he1pful to your particular pO nts.
 
Best of luck in any event,

10/17/83
 
Bess has forwarded along to me the pages of your thesis
 
that you sent to her and according to the agreement we reached
 
at our meeting in Austin, I
'd like to make a couple of comments
 
and some urgent suggestions.
 
First of all, I think that you, along with othqr American
 
scholars, should put the American cowboy story in its historical
 
perspective.  Northern Europe and western Europe were conquered
 
by horsemen and by people who hued on their cattle herds. The
 
Northwest coastal fringe has been cattle eountry probably longer
 
than its been agricultural country.  The mounted knight of the
 
past, with a few retainers, could control a whole stretch of
 
country, f
acing down the local footmen.  By the same token, the
 
cattle herders, with their supply of protein on the hoof, were
 
a far more mobile force for migration and for combat with those
 
who opposed them.
 
These ancient traditions have entered the Americas in a
 
'
number of places; the Vaqueros of Venezuela, the plains of
 
Mexico, the Cajun country, and flourished there long before
 
the year of the cowboy began.
 In all these places they have
 
been the focus of popular imagination and ent Ysiasm, just as they
 
were in the west.  And yet all of these are the continuance of
 
the theme of cattle pastoralism which, as I said, had one of its
 
flowerings in western Europe, from Spain to Norway-which has
 
had a very similar character--migratory, predatory, careless of
 
the views and lives of settled folk, ballad creating, etc--
wherever it has appeared.
 
The fact that America fixed upon the cowboy and his brief moment
 
of trail herding, and still remains fixated upon him is a sign
 
of the passionate importance of this image in the minds of all
 
western Europeans, most especially people of Irish, central Spanish,
 
Scottish, and West German descent.  Not to acknowledge this
 
background makes the western or romantic revival, and the recent
 
Library of Congress celebration, seem extremely superficial
 
and unrewarding enterprises.  Folklore must deal in the
 
big, deep, living and ever renewing traditions of mankind
 
and these have a reason for being that goes f
ar beyond the
 
momentary phenomenon of the interest of a Whist, or a Roosevelt,
 
or a Lomax, in a particular local development.  Perhaps I
've
 
gone on too long.
 
In relation to my f
ather's work, I beg you to remember one
 
thing: that he was as passionately interested in black lore and
 
later in Mexican lore as he was in the cowboy material.  His
 
black collections, which I
've just surveyed, are an absolute
 
treasure to which he devoted his last years.  He pursued
 
is discoveries about Tex
 Negroes all across the south and
 
uTti
Te!y
t
-t àted theA slave narratives which have been become
 
the principle source for information about blacks.
 In this
 
respect, I think you really ought not to quote him calling
 
blacks "niggers."  It's what we call a "buzz" word in the
 
communications world.  You know
that in his day, all whites
 
and all blacks used this now objectionable term with complete
 
freedom and, very very frequently, with affection.  After I
 
came along, he agreed not to use it when he realized that
 
it was painful for the new generations of blacks to hear it.
 
If you use it in your thesis, you must know that most blacks
 
will simply cancel out the fact that Lomax cared more for their
 
lore than anyone who has appeared on the scene thus far, perhaps
 
including even Zora Hurs ton, at least in terms of years of sustained
 
effort.
 
Perhaps you )do  not know that he recorded hundreds of
 
traditional Mexican songs for the Library of Congress, as well
 
as an enormous body of songs from whites, and that he and I were
 
the first to record Cajun lore, and that my f
ather pursued this
 
French interest into New Orleans, where he rej,Q.rded a great deal
 
of the best material we have on Creoles.  I
rr-
t9  his regional
 
in erest was cross-Ethnic, f
ar more urbane, if you like, than that
 
of most peop e in
 is area.
 
One thing more.  My father, as you know, developed a policy
 
of making composite versions because he wanted to address a
 
national audience.  He was, however, most careful to preserve
 
every document from which these versions were taken for l
ater
 
scientific study.  He was quite skeptical about what could
 
be learned from that study, but he went along with its dictates.
 
And far more importantly, the documents that he became more
 
passionately concerned about--that is, the disks that he recorded--
are useable scientific data because they are entirely controlled
 
by the performers, whereas a page of verses in a collector's
 
notebook has mosr of the reality s  ee  d o t
 .
 So, in
 
my estimation,  y fa  er, with his constant musical recording,
 
was the first real scientist in the field of American folklore--
at least I have been able to use his recordings to help create
 
what might be called a hard science of comparative folklore study.
 
-
-
 I do think you should emphasize his interest in absolute
 
authenticity.  He liked nothing so much as the authentic
 
performer and cared deeply about trying to represent the authentic
 
performer and the authentic performing tradition in his work.
 
This is one of the best veins of folklo
--not the only one, of
 
course.
 
In relation to all this, I strongly suggest that you leave
 
out the quote about the lynching in Meridian.  Unless you are
 
going to make a real, full-length portrait of my father in an
 
autobiographical sense, I think that you are using his quotes
 
about "niggers" and this rape scene out of
ntext, which I have
 
just tried to indicate.
 It will turn off a lot of people in the
 
black f
f
ludience, who, I hope, will and should one day listen to
 
the records.
 
Another suggestion I have is to cut the ward "paramour."
 
This means "mistress," or "bedmate," and I am absolutely
 
certain that my f
ather and Shirley Green were not bedmates.
 
Unless you can show me otherwise, I feel that as executor of
 
the Lomax estate and in relation to our previous conversation,
 
I have the right to ask you to strike "paramour" and substitute
 
another word.  As you know, I am sending copies of this letter
 
to my sisters, Bess and Shirley.  Frankly, I was surprised r
iot
 
to hear from you directly, since I did take off quite a few hours
 
to discuss the whole problem with you when we met in Austin.
 
In any case, all best wishes on your thesis and let me know what
 
you decide to do.
 
erely
, yours,
 
Alai

As I started n
o leove he deplored the blindness of people  ho
 
do not seek to preserve what is really vital and distinctive in
 
their institutions, worshipping their ideal of things rather thori
 
the grosser and more truthful reality.
 He cited the indi niticn
 
Eelt at his "Winning of the West," becau se he did not  ma ke 
knights of the pioneers instead of the freebooting vikingr  t
hey
 
seally were.
 He claimed that he had too much respect for a
 
horty-Niner to call him a "knight."  I asked him if he was going
 
to write a history of Texas.
 He answered about as follows
 
 
I shall not be able to do that.
 See the work that is piled on
. uc.
 
Don't you see the people won't let me alone.
 I don't suppose
 
they ever will until I break down entirely.
 I would have
 
thousands of demands on my time."  I told him that I thought h
 
determination was a pity,  since he certainly was splendidly
 
equipped for the task.
 He replied quickly, "I think I am,  too:
 
ond Texas has a history of such wonderful interest which has her,
 
L
ily handled by northern writers.
 They all say that Texas was
 
settled from a desire to extend the slave territory, when the
 
t
ruth is that Sam Houston and his crowd would have conquered Ter:s
 
just the way they did had there never been a slave in the south.
 
In was again the old viking spirit pressing westward and
 
dispossessing an inferior race.
 But I can't, I can't," he addyd
 
mournfully.
 "I won't have time."  Mr. Abbott 5 referred to his
 
s
peech at the John Brown celebration [in Ossawatamie, Kansasi
 
next week, and Mr. Rooseve
lt interjected,
 "I told
 those
 people
 
that I wouldn't talk about John Brown.
 Ican't say what I rca Yk'
 
think of him."  Then he put his hand on my shoulder in a playful
 
mincer and said,  "I quote in my speech what Abraham Lincoln saiL
 
about John Brown.

you  hollow so loud, do you think the Lord is deef or asleep?"  A

One morning when I was perhaps eight or nine years old I
L was
 
turning a large grindstone for my father while he held an axe
 
against it.  We needed sharp axes that day, for it was too cold
 
for farm work and we were all going to the woods.
 Turning to
 
grindstone is hard work,  especially when the cold nips your
 
fingers stretched around an iron bar;  so when a stalwart youns
,
 
negro came around the house and proposed to take my place, I
 
grateful.
 That was Nat.  He had come out two miles from
 erid
 
looking for work, and I had not seen him before.
 I stood
,
 
admiringly by and watched him whiz the stone around wjtoo! t
 
apparent effort.
 He pleased my father so much that he hired h
i .
 
Thus began a three years friendship for me that perhaps gave my
 
life its bent.
 One night I found him poring over a biue-hac od
 
Webster's spelling book.
 He barely knew his letters.
 i
rPin
 
three years he had completed the series of readers, knew
 
geography, grammar, history, arit1metic,  some algebra, a
id
 
rc o
 
a good hand.
 He and I collaborated when he wrote his sweetheat-
- -
-
-
they were wonderful love-letters, as you may well imagine.
 In
 
return for this service Nat gave a
 love that was akin to worsiip,
 
He nursed me when I was sick, stood champion in all my boyhood
 
troubles.
 Nothing was too good for
 
'
Hr. Johnny," as he always
 
called me

 At that time I was a popular stud

and one of the recognized student leaders (you will not accuse r

 Dr. Winston had already entered on that career o
f
 
intense unpopularity that has cost him so much here.
 Upon
 
consideration I concluded that aside from doing my work I could
 
help him to his deserved position in the esteem of students and
 
Faculty, and,  in doing so, I thought myself to be rendering the
 
University a valuable and needed service.
 I went to work with

 Six months from that

A second paper, also written in January, dealt with "Th0
 
5o1 1,1 South."
 
In it Lomax  gave  three causes for the domination
 
South by the Democratic party:
 the "Republican doctrine of the
 
tariff," described as "a gigantic predatory cow feeding over the South
 
and west while all her rich milk streams into New England milk pails";
 
the alliance of blacks in the South with Republicans; and most
 
important,  the residue of prejudice from the Civil War which Southera
 
politicians utilized to control puh Ic opinion.
 Because hero vor

ars
 
give  them feudal devotion, and go about his business without worryiro
 
about substantive issues.  This makes the South "as thorough] y
 
Tarnmanyized as the Bowery districts of New York City."
 The doninonce
 
of politically directed newspapers compounds the problem to defeat  m y
 
attempt at individual thought--"The brave man is prudent, but the
 
continued practice of this habit is death to mental sincerity."  Part
 
rule in the South keeps sectional strife a
] ly e
 in order  to Sep
 
in power.
 Finally, "oversteppinc every  poution that

and slave,  however unwise,  there is now two peories

I wish you would ask Professor MacKenzie if it would he possiL
 
for me to get hold of four or five Yale students who can sing m
 
assist me in a little extra that I should like to put on at tb
 
close of my performance.
 If these young men could procure c
.a:
'
 
cowboy togs and appear in my vicinity about the close of  t
'
c
 
lecture,  I think two or three of the songs might be render H
 
effectively, particularly some that I have in mind with ra
 
choruses.
 I do not think there is any preparatory trainiry
 
necessary except to interview the young men and see that
 
look enough like cowboys to bring out the local color.
 In
 
hour's meeting I could teach them enough cowboy music for t
H
 
occasion.
 One soloist, with a chorus of four, would make
 
excellent combination.
 It seems to me that some such final ,
,
 
would bring the evening to a pleasant close,  c

the Journal is to put in more articles relating to the
 
literature of the folk rather than the purely scientific
 
anthropological study.
 I find that nearly all the recently
 
organized folk lore societies have great difficulty in getti:
 
subscribers because so many of the readers are not interested
 
in the articles that emanate from the School of Anthropo1
.oty
 
of Columbia University.
