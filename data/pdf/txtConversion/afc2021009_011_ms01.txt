CH 00:01
Good afternoon and thank you so much for agreeing to participate in this historical project, the Archie 
Green Folklife Occupational project with the Library of Congress. How are you today?
RW
I’m well. [Inaudible 0:19].
CH
Thank you so much. Would you please give me your complete name and your year of birth?
RW
Riley Bedford Walters, Jr.  1924.
CH
No! 1924?
RW
1954.
CH
I was getting ready to say, you don't look like 1924 to me [laughs].
RW
1954.
CH
Where were you born and raised?
RW
In Roxboro, North Carolina.
CH
Is that where you were raised as well?
RW
Yes.
CH
Your family dynamic? Your parents, siblings?
RW
I have two brothers. I was from a two-parent household. I have a brother that lives in Chicago and one 
that lives in Connecticut.
CH
Okay. What occupations did your parents have?
3
afc2021009_011
RW
My mother was a housewife and my father worked in tailoring and dry cleaning.
CH
Okay. Are you married? Have you been married? Any children?
RW
I'm divorced. No children.
CH
Okay. Who or what encouraged you to become a nurse?
RW
Finances. I was in the military and I could not get promoted. I was an EEG technician, so for me to get
promoted I needed 999 points and for me to get promoted as a LPN, it took 650 points, which I
surpassed. So, I went into the nursing program and got promoted.
CH
You went into the nursing program while you were in the military.
RW
In the military.
CH
What branch of the military were you in?
RW
The Army.
CH
Where did you go for nursing school?
RW
Fort Sam Houston Academy of Health Sciences.
CH
Where is that?
RW
San Antonio, Texas.
CH
In Texas. You said you were an LPN prior to that?
RW
4
afc2021009_011
I was an LPN. That's the result of having gone through the program.
CH
So, you were an LPN from San Antonio. Where did you go to become an RN?
RW
Here, North Carolina Central University. I retired from the military in 1997, so I started school here in
1998 and graduated in 2001. When my parents sent me to college, I was a business major. I didn't
graduate and so I joined the military.
CH
Where did you go for your business?
RW
North Carolina A&T.
CH
Okay, so you had most of your higher education in North Carolina.
RW
In North Carolina.
CH
Here at North Carolina Central, you obtained a Bachelor of Science in Nursing?
RW
Yes.
CH
Do you have any graduate degrees?
RW
No.
CH
Take us on your journey as a nurse. What positions have you held and what is your current position?
RW
When I was in the military, I was what’s called the ward master, so I supervised the enlisted personnel
on my ward. So, it was usually 12 people or greater. My first job was in cardiothoracic surgery and then
I moved to [inaudible 4:23] surgery and then I moved to a mobile Army surgical hospital.
CH
Was it in the field?
RW
5
afc2021009_011
That was in the field. That was in Kansas, and then I went to a Combat Support Hospital in Colorado,
and I retired out of Colorado.
CH
Any other nursing experience?
RW
Then, I got my BSN and I worked orthopedics part-time at Duke University Medical Center and I rated
eligibility for the military. That was my primary job once I obtained my BSN.
CH
Rating eligibility for the military.
RW
Yes, for veterans.
CH
What was that like? What did you do?
RW 05:14
Well, you had to learn laws and regulations and make sure that the person met the criteria to receive the
benefit they had requested.
CH
Did you like that?
RW
I liked it. A lot of disappointments because, you know, people expected something and they couldn't get
it because, whether it was an increase or an initial claim, because they didn't meet the criteria.
CH
What other positions have you held?
RW
I currently work as a nurse, a charge nurse, on the floor at Croasdaile Village, which is a long-term care
facility. It's a community, but I work in the long-term care area.
CH
As charge nurse, what are your duties?
RW
It's everything. You work the cart, you supervise CNAs. That's your job.
CH
And CNAs are certified nursing assistants and the cart is--
6
afc2021009_011
RW
Medication cart and wound cart.
CH
You pass medications and you do wound dressings as well?
RW
Yeah.
CH
How long have you been doing that?
RW
Two years.
CH
How long have you been a nurse?
RW
Well, I started out as a LPN in 1988. I actually graduated from what we call [inaudible 6:45] Charlie, our
practical nurse program, in 1986. The Army required us to have a license by 1988, which I did. Then, I
got my BSN in 2001. So, I've been a nurse since-- a RN since 2001.
CH
When you came to North Carolina Central for your nursing, for your bachelor's, you were still in the
military or you had retired?
RW
I had retired.
CH
You had retired. Okay, I think you said that but I just wanted to refresh my memory there. What has
been your experience as a male nurse? What have been the challenges and have you faced any biases as
a male nurse?
RW
You always faced biases as a male nurse, because not only do your patients sometimes, your co-workers
as well feel that if you're a male in nursing that you got to be gay. So to me, that's very biased and that's
one of the challenges too. But, you're in a female-dominated profession. So, I have no problem with
female leaders, but I do have problems when they give the females all the jobs and ignore the males.
CH
You feel that's what happens to male nurses?
RW
Sometimes, and I know in my experience, it did happen to me.
7
afc2021009_011
CH
Okay. You wanna share that?
RW
You were promoted, but you were only promoted routinely. But female nurses, they got asked, "Would
you like to go to this program so that you can become the charge nurse so that you will have experience
so that you can become the head nurse or a manager?" But I was never afforded that opportunity, and it
may be because I only worked part-time, but I still don't feel that was an excuse.
CH
Still felt like it was a bias--
RW
It was!
CH
Towards you being a male nurse. I had a different perspective of male nurses. I was gonna ask you if
you think that male nurses advanced more easy than female nurses, but you're telling me no, that's not
the case. Okay, so you feel that bias there. In the climate of racial unrest and inequality in healthcare,
can you share any insights and/or experiences that you have faced, if any?
RW 09:49
Well, you always encounter biases and you always encounter prejudices, and it's usually due because of
your culture, who you are. You're an African American male, so automatically people think that you are
abrupt or-- so, you always trying to fight against perceptions. The way to defeat that is to know who you
are and you confront things. You confront them on the spot if you can use tact. Sometimes you can't so
you have to wait 'til later, but it's better when you can confront things immediately and tactfully.
CH
Do you have any ideas on solutions for bridging racial gaps in the nursing profession and in healthcare?
RW
You have to-- If we can make it more equal in the care of our culture, then we will be-- it won't be so
rough on us, because we are always-- I prefer, when I'm in that environment, I prefer to take care of my
patients, my African American patients, because I think that I'm gonna give them quality care. Not
saying that my counterparts, whether they be Hispanic or Filipino or Caucasian, won't give them care,
but I don't think they would give them the quality of care that I will, and I don't really think that they
will be as receptive to them as they are to me. So, I like taking care of them. I like for them to know that
they are cared for and that they are getting the best quality of care that can be given to them.
CH
You have a vested interest in making sure that your African American patients know that they have
value and that they are getting the best care that they can get from you. Is that what you're saying?
RW
8
afc2021009_011
Yes.
CH
Chi Eta Phi Sorority Incorporated. What chapter and region are you in?
RW
I'm in Pi chapter and I'm in the southeast region.
CH
How long have you been in Chi Eta Phi?
RW
Since 2002, March.
CH
Me too [laughs].
RW
2003.
CH
Okay, I came in in 2002. Have you been an officer on the local, national or regional level?
RW
Yes. In my local chapter, I was doing the membership and now I'm Basileus.
CH
Now, Basileus is the--
RW
President of my chapter.
CH
Okay.
RW
Regional, I was the nominating committee chair and, nationally, I was the nominating committee chair.
CH
Okay. What did you do as the nominating committee chair?
RW
The nominating committee chair has the most difficult job in the sorority because you have to have a
slate of officers and it's very difficult getting people to run for office.
CH
9
afc2021009_011
Why do you think that is?
RW
I just think they don't have a vested interest in becoming an officer. I know locally, we do everything to
keep people interested and engaged and wanting to excel, and they still don't want to [both laugh].
CH
So, what type of activities do you engage your members in?
RW
We have trainings. We have leadership seminars every year. I'm getting ready to do a mentoring program
for four weeks. With this program, you have to apply for it and you apply for the specific position that
you want. So, I have someone interested in becoming the Tamiochus and the Beta sponsor.
CH
And the Tamiochus is?
RW
The treasurer.
CH
Okay.
RW
And the Beta sponsor is the person that's in charge of undergraduate Chi Eta Phi members.
CH
With the mentoring program, is that geared towards persons who want to assume an office?
RW
Yes.
CH
Okay. Not occupational mentoring.
RW
Not occupational at all.
CH
Okay.
RW
We do have a mentoring program where we assist at the University. We have members that are in
leadership positions in the community that come back and teach or present for, of course, when they are
doing leadership, undergraduate.
10
afc2021009_011
CH
They are members of your chapter that go out to-- is it just one University or?
RW
I don't know for sure that they go to Watts College of Nursing, but I think that they did go to Watts and
here at North Carolina Central. The other school is Durham Technical College. I'm not sure if they go
there.
CH
Okay. What type of service projects does your chapter engage in?
RW 16:23
We do blood pressure checks, and that's one of the signature things from the sorority nationally. We also
volunteer at an elementary school, and it was started by the previous president of my chapter to get
people as early as possible to become interested in nursing by seeing us there and doing things with
them. In two weeks, we'll be partnering with-- Well actually, yeah, maybe partnering with Iota Phi
Theta. They’re having their regional conference and they have asked that Pi chapter come and do blood
pressure checks and an exercise program. So, we got to find somebody to do Zumba and present on
prostate and colon cancer, because those are things that's very prevalent in African American men.
CH
So, your service projects, which are community service-oriented, does that give your chapter more
visibility in the community?
RW
Yes, it does, and I think this Iota Phi Theta event will give us more publicity, but we always-- Yearly, we
make sure that we have articles in the local paper and magazines in the city.
CH
Theta is what?
RW
[Inaudible 18:12].
CH
Okay, one of the Greek organizations from the historically Black university and colleges.
RW
That's correct.
CH
Okay.
RW
And they're probably at all universities, because the Divine Nine, they are at other universities, but they
originated at-- Well, not really, because Kappa originated at Indiana University.
11
afc2021009_011
CH
Okay. A lot of ‘em originated at--
RW
Historically Black colleges and universities. Mostly I think Howard.
CH
Howard University in Washington, D.C. Do you feel that Chi Eta Phi makes a difference in service for
humanity?
RW
Yes, because of the things that we do in the community. Although we are visible, I don't think we are as
visible as the Divine Nine, because everybody recognizes them. In my chapter, we're trying to get
everybody to recognize us as Pi chapter of Chi Eta Phi Sorority Incorporated. What I like about Chi Eta
Phi is the diversity, because Chi Eta Phi, they accept men into the organization and I think that's
phenomenal.
CH
After all, it is a professional nurse sorority. Even though it's called a sorority, it is for professional
nurses, so why not embrace the males as well? Okay, so that's a great asset, that Chi Eta Phi sorority, and
a uniqueness of Chi Eta Phi Sorority Incorporated. COVID-19, the current pandemic of this 21st
century, has had varying effects on our society. How has it impacted your practice in nursing and how
has it impacted what your chapter does?
RW 20:45
It impacted nursing because I had to wear a mask. That was the biggest thing. All the time, you know. I
have to wear a mask in different situations, but to have to wear one all the time, I had to get very used to
it. And it made you sort of paranoid that, are they really working, because I was one of the few, maybe,
or many that got COVID. I did everything I could to prevent me from getting it, and I didn't get it until
after I'd had our first vaccination. So, I felt that I didn't know what else to do, because I had worn my
mask, I washed my hands, I wore the gowns when I had a patient with COVID. I did everything that our
protocol required and yet I still got it. Then, with the sorority, it prevented us from going out and doing
all the things that we normally did because we interacted with people. So, although we did almost
everything except for the blood pressure checks, we still gave money and we still took pictures with our
mask on with people that we supported, because we wanted them to know that we were going to still
support them regardless of what the times are like, and they were receptive because they wanted to take
pictures with us. Later, they even took off their masks to take pictures with us, but just for a photograph.
So, it changed everything we did: how we met and what we did in the community. Although we
volunteered at the school, we still wore masks, but the governor has lifted mask wearing at the school. I
volunteer on Wednesday but I'll have my mask on. I tutor math and reading on Wednesdays.
CH
How did your chapter meet during the height of the pandemic and even now?
RW
12
afc2021009_011
Originally we started off with conference calls and then we got Zoom. So, for the last year of the
pandemic, we have been meeting on Zoom.
CH
And you still meet that way?
RW
We still meet that way, and we probably won't start meeting face-to-face until the next fiscal year. We
will offer Zoom as well, because there are people that are still not wanting to meet face-to-face.
CH
What activities does your chapter engage in at the elementary school?
RW 24:03
Well, I have another person that tutors with me, and then we do their annual-- they have an annual health
day-- not health day. They have an annual professional day where people from all professions come and
talk to them. So, we are always present at that. But for me, I said, I think, that I tutor math and reading
on Wednesdays with a third grade class, and the person that's gonna come this week, I think she's gonna
do a first or second grade class, ‘cause you get the choice of who you want to work with. I chose the
third grade class because I was told by an educator that that was the best grade to get them for them to
be receptive to change and to learn. So, I wanted somebody that I could shape. I didn't want someone
that could not understand, but they were old enough to understand and be receptive to the help that they
were being given.
CH
Do the children know that you're a nurse?
RW
Yes.
CH
What is their response to you as a nurse?
RW
“How can you be a nurse and a teacher?” [both laugh]
CH
And your response to them is?
RW
Well, I'm retired and I do this because I care. I want you all to be the best you can be, and hopefully one
of you will be a nurse. So, when they had Pi Day, which was a day that you had to go and show them
how do you use math in your job and how do you use math in your everyday life, although I taught them
math, I brought them my stethoscope and I let them listen to each other's heart and their abdomen and
they-- it was fascinating to them, the sounds, so I hope I sparked an interest.
13
afc2021009_011
CH
Absolutely. What advice would you have for males who might be interested in becoming a nurse?
RW
That you can always get a job [both laugh]. I have never been unemployed since I've been a nurse, as a
LPN or RN. Anytime I applied for a job I was hired. So, I think that-- Well, I know that nursing-- nurses
are in demand but sometimes, and depending on your location, male nurses, people look forward to
having male nurses on board.
CH
So, you think things have changed as far as the perception of male nurses or do you still feel the
stereotype is there?
RW
I still feel it's there, that's why I say ambiguous. Even the ones that are receptive to male nurses, they
have their moments where the bigotry comes in.
CH
Okay. What do you feel the future of nursing has in store for us?
RW
I think how we practice will change tremendously since COVID, because a lot of the nurses are not
doing nursing anymore. They're doing other things. Then, you have those that are becoming
practitioners and that's a big thing. That will help us, because we need more people out in the field to
ensure that people get adequate care. I don’t know what else to say [both laugh].
CH
That is just fine. That is just fine. Do you have any advice for people who want to come into nursing?
Any advice?
RW
Yes. First, you gotta want to do it, and if you want to do it, you gotta love it, and then you deal with
everything that's thrown at you, because this is what you love, and this is what you do and this is who
you are.
CH
Has nursing been rewarding and fulfilling for you?
RW
Yes. I told you I've never been unemployed so I always had money [both laugh]. Wasn't a lot of money
and I had to really work hard for it, but I've never been unemployed because of the profession.
CH
What about your membership in Chi Eta Phi Sorority Incorporated? Has that been really meaningful and
fulfilling for you?
14
afc2021009_011
RW
It has. I've met some great people. Lifelong bonds, not just with my chapter but with people in my
region and nationally, because I have friends in California. They're more than a brother or sister. They
are my friends, so yes, it has been very rewarding.
CH
Finally, as we're wrapping up here, what are your thoughts on our beloved Chi Eta Phi Sorority
Incorporated, and do you have any words of wisdom as far as service for humanity is concerned?
RW
Well, I like what we do for service for humanity. I like our partnerships, and we get new ones
occasionally. Again, I like what we do. I like that we support March of Dimes, St. Jude, sickle cell.
Those are the ones that I like so, of course, I do more about the things I like than the things that I don't.
CH
I just want to ask you one more question about being the president of a chapter. Do you like it?
RW
That's an unfair question [both laugh]. There are moments that I love it and then there are moments that I
don’t. It's a very demanding job, and people sometimes treat you as if you get paid to volunteer and
that's not the case.
CH
It does have its rewards, however.
RW
It does.
CH
Well, I thank you so much, Frater Riley, but Riley is not your last name. What's your last name again?
RW
Walters.
CH
Walters! Frater Walters, I thank you so much again for, first of all, being patient with the delays that I
had in my travel today. I'll make you laugh a little later. I thank you for your patience and I thank you so
much, again, for agreeing to be a part of this historical project. The fact that this will be housed at the
Library of Congress means that your relatives, years and years and years from now, will be able to see
your face and hear your voice because you have been a part of this. We, again, are gonna be
remembered, as long as the Earth is around, because of this project. One of the things that they said
about our African American history is that we didn't record things, and so I'm so very thankful and
excited that we have been given this opportunity to have our voices heard and to be documented in such
a place as the Library of Congress. So, I thank you so much again.
RW
