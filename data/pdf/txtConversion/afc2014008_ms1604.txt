Gear  r i aii :
 
J
nder separate cover I a
mn sending you the preliminary
 
unnuscript of the collection of Georgia Negro childrens' games
 
we spoke about.
 It is not complete; a discography, annotations,
 
nckowledgments and so forth are still to be included.
 I m us t
 
i
lso apologize for the bad quality of the typing; various students,
 
using various typewriters, helped me out, and the more legible
 
c
c
 .
aanuscript is currently at my brother's in New York.
 
T suspect that the job will have to be done over, or
 
least extensively edited; there is rather too much information
 
:or lay readers and the tone is too informal for scholars. I
'm
 
raid.
 (
I suppose I should be used to this rather uncomfortable
 
;
osition by now; no matter how hard I try I have a foot firmly
 
tanted in both camps.) It also seems to be a rather lengthy affsir
 
t
'
tough I believe there are a few good ideas in it.
 To save you
 
ime eye-strain, most of my own notions are contained in the
 
rious "essays", a word which I believe I will take out.
 i
rs.
 
T
hne s
' remarks, almost all of them cogent and acute, are contained
 
blocked-off paragraphs in the head notes.  All the rest is
 
,y game-description and can easily be skipped.
 
Would it be possible for you to return the manuscript
 
.
en you have looked it over?  Should it, or another version, ever
 
published, I should certainly send you a copy; should it not,
 
d should you want a copy for your files, I
'll be glad to send this
 
e back. 
But I am still in the troublesome stage of showing it
 
r
ound, and I simply don't have enough copies.  And if you have the
 
u
r
ic or inclination to send me any criticisms,  I should of course
 
enormously grateful. I keep feeling that it is an imposition to
 
v this bale of verbiage upon you, but I remind myself that you
 
e it; I feel both flattered and slightly alarmed.
 
the way, I would like very much to see your student's
 
j
7
 rope if it ever becomes available.
 I have been play-
around myself with a notion about the structure (mostly rhythmic)
 
the major jump rope rhymes and wonder if my ideas would fit with
 
rs at all.
 On the subject of student papers,  by the way, I re-
ived a paper last spring from a student who conducted a random
 
u
pling of adult party games via questionnaire and interview and
 
me up with some interesting results.  Haven't you written on this?
 
I haven't so far succeeded in locating a copy of your PiDer; should
 
you like to see this I
'd be glad to send it along.

Dear Mrs. Hawes:
 
This letter is in connection with our use of a television
 
lesson you made with us some time ago.
 
Our County Counsel has informed us that we should no longer
 
pay residual fees on such programs.  We have done so in good
 
faith in the past because of a commitment we  felt we had
 
with you.
 
We would like to use the programs again, but we  feel we
 
should check with you to see how you feel about it.
 It is
 
my understanding that we could put the material on a kine-
scope and would not have to pay a residual.  We chose not
 
to do that, initially, because of degradation of quality.
 We
 
would prefer at this time to continue the use of the video
 
tape.
 
Will you please let me know of your reactions?
 
Cordially ,,
yours,

Dear Dr. :erlettis
 
Thank you for your letter con-
cerning the television lesson I taped for the
 
Division of iducational Nedia some years ago.
 
I w u1d be happy if you would like to continue
 
using the program, and it does seem to me that
 
you have been most fair in payment.  So as far
 
as I am concerned, therefore, I waive further
 
residual f
ees.
 
However  there are two things
 
I would like to suggest for the future.  First
 
that more formalized and specific agreements
 
for the use and re-use of the programs be spelled
 
out in writing before the lesson is taped.
 
Secondly, that some limit be placed on re-use
 
of taped programs  perhaps in terms of numbers
 
of years.
 here  is a  ontinuous stream of new
  
material available to the teacher/lecturer, after
 
all, and I would not now do that particular lesson
 
in the same way that I did it four or five years
 
ago.  I hate to think of generations of future
 
California children sitting through material
 
that is already begin ing to be outdated!
 
I am sure, tough, that your office
 
has this situation as well in hand as may be.
 I
 
would a.reciate your letting me know what you
 
eventually decide to do, and apologi e, incidentally,
 
for taking so long to answer your letter.  I have
 
been out of town for some months.
 
Sincerely,

the film consists of three sequences sort of pasted together:
 
his version of the famous "buck dance"; his owr
 
discussion of his fife (which he calls a "

to play it and make it etc., and a final shot of his playing t,:

Dear Dr. Birdwhjste].l:
 
My brother, Alan Lomax, s
uggested that I s
end you the enclosed paper,
 
which is an informal presentation of a notion I hope, eventually, to
 
develop much further.  I wrote it up in answer to a request for an
 
article to be included in a book on the general s
ubject of games and
 
play, and, compared with your work, it s
eems to me embarrassingly ten-
tative and amateurish.  However, Alan Insists that you might find it
 
contains some Interesting Ideas; I hope he's right, as I feel rather
 
presumptuous to be s
ending anybody anything to read, especially unso-
licited.  (
It is the end of the s
emester, and my own eyes are about
 
gone.)
 
I
'd also like to ask if you plan to continue at S
tanford for the aca-
demic year 1969-70?  It is possible that I may take next year off
 
from teaching to renew my own incomplete education; I have applied
 
for graduate work at Berkeley among other places, but I didn't know
 
at the time that you were at S
tanford.  Would there be any chance of
 
my at least auditing any of your courses -
-
 assuming that you are
 
teaching and that you will be s
taying on?
 
Perhaps on my next trip up to Berkeley, I might stop by Stanford and
 
pay you a brief call.  We have one other friend in common, I believe;
 
Edmund Carpenter, who is currently at U
.C. Santa Cruz, has often
 
spoken of you most admiringly.
 
Sincerely yours,
 
Bess Lomax Hawes

 JQ.,
 God knows.
 
Actually, I haven't yet been able to go through your book with the
 
thoroughness i
t deserves.  I have two senior students working on
 
analagous projects; they happened to see i
t on my desk, and since
 
I think good students are more deserving than medium teachers any
 
day, I let them take first grabs.  Now that the semester i
s over, I
'll

1 an enclosing, by way of thanks and appreciation, two brief productions
 
of my own.  The reprint was rather mangled by the jpurnal editing process;
 
Dr. Hand doesn't care for a feminine style, I find, and the printers
 
don't know how to keep texts straight.  However, the point is still there,
 
I think.  The other is a sort of working paper which I want to go on
 
with when I have the strength to start wrestling with it again.  Isn't
 
i
t most curious how the most simple-minded ideas are ultimately the most
 
difficult?
 
Thank you again for the book.  It will be put to good use, and I do
 
appreciate your thinking of me.

Dear Peter:
 
Enclosed are two manuscripts sent to you here at SFVSC; I opened them
 
before I noticed your name, which i
s rather coyly hidden in the address.
 
I
'm also sending along a reprint of my own, in partial return for
 
your fine article on Ruichol Mythology.  I hope we see each other again before
 
another year rolls by; it's quits silly to be so near and yet so seldom.
 
I
'll phone you some time this month when I get a copy of my childrens
 
game film to show you; i
t has once again been swallowed by the
 
laboratory for technical refining.
 
Yours,

Dear Bess :
 
T
ijank you so much for eending me the stuff that was sent there,
 
and your own reprint.
 I am very anxious to see the children's
 
film,  of course...
 
Dee and Bobby and I went on the Huichol peyote journey--spent
 
three weeks in Mexico and shot about
 10,000 feet of color, plus
 
lots of recordings. I am gradually getting it processed and printed
 
and so far it looks as though there will be a good documentary
 
film.
 Other than that, UCLA keeps me busy; also I am still
 
teaching at SC, and naturally I keep up with the goings-on at
 
Valley State. God.,.
 Have you heard from Count?
 
Best regards,
 
Peter Furst
 
You are right about getting together. Maybe your film will provide
 
the occasion.

I am sending, under separate cover, my young man's chef d

this April, you would just want to bring it along with you - -  assuming

I happened to show my La Llorona article to a Sociology professor here,
 
who l
oaned it to a friend of his who works as a parole supervisor for
 
an experimental project called "Esperansa."  The friend wrote back,
 
rather unflatteringly, with far more comment about your article in the
 
same journal than about mine!  1
. thought you might be interested:
 
Scatalogically speaking, shit or gorno  -
 its Slavic equivalent
 
dung or galabina -  again its Slavic equivalent -
 is hardly
 
something vile or filthy.  To the European or Oriental
 
peasant, it's a necessity •  something to increase soil viability.
 
We may consider those European intruders who before l
eaving
 
would deposit excretement either on the window sill or bed as
 
a recompense, a gift given to the host, perhaps something more
 
precious that that which was taken.
 
(
On the other hand), perhaps house
. breakers in general are not
 
house-broken, and this thought may appeal toxspsychiatrists
 
of a particular school.  Deposits l
eft on beds may be related
 
to fertility rites but in any case these droppings are more
 
than those leavings of semen when one considers
 
odor, color and quantity.
 Vv already shown how preoccupied
 
I can be with the topic....
 
Apparently you have struck a common chord!

Dr. Norman Markal
 
Communications Sciences Laboratory

Gainesville  Florida, 32601
 
Dear Dr. Markal:
 
This coming semester, spring 1969, I plan to teach a small seminar class
 
in Cantometrics in the Anthropology Department of this college.  This i
s
 
my second attempt at the project, the first having taken place a year
 
ago with not especially outstanding results, I
'm afraid.  There were many
 
problems: primarily, my own recent and minimal familiarity with the system.
 
However, a secondary problem which I caught on to when i
t was really too
 
late was that none of the students were familiar with even the concept of
 
pars 
linguist ice.
 
When I mentioned to my brother, Alan Lomax, over the phone the other day
 
that I had decided to start off the semester by digging into paralinguistics
 
and kinesics as a starting point, he suggested that I write y
ou to enquire
 
about some teaching tapes that you have prepaped on pitch, loudness, tempo,
 
and so forth,  He also said that he thought you had them but perhaps he did.
 
Do you know what he i
s talking about?  If you do have them, could I possibly
 
buy copies from you?  If I can buy them, could you just go ahead and have them
 
copied and bill me, or i
s there another source to which I should write?
 
Alan has sent me consensus testing tapes on several of the cantometric p
arameters:
 
ten, i
f I can recall correctly.  He mentioned also that there were tapes
 
prepared for twelve or thirteen others which had not yet been consensed.  I would
 
be glad to help on such a project if I could; I have lots of students of adult,
 
high school and college age, available to me a
s testees, and I
'm sure that the
 
students in the seminar would be interested in helping out with the necessary
 
arrangements, record keeping and so on.  Please let me know if you would l
ike
 
any VoAp Coast testing run; I would be most happy to help out any way that I
 
could.
 
In reference to the tapes, any help you could give me would be greatly
 
appreciated.
 
Sincerely,
 
Bess Lomax Hawes

My dear Bess,
 
I
 was d
elighted t
o g
et your letter.  Robert and I plan to
 
]
save here on August 9
, which is a Wednesday, and arrive in Boulder as
 
soon as possible and spend the l
eek-end with you.  Robert wants  to know
 
which is the radieaJ. camp -Brace or anti-brace.
 
I went to a lecture by Tindale once at UCLA.  H
e showed a film
 
of an initiation ceremony in which a boy had his two front teeth
 
extracted by means of bashing them with a large stone.  It wasa silent
 
film, so Tindale sang the accomparring chant himself.  The process took
 
about half an hour, and the boy looked juite happy, like a lady at the
 
hairdresser.
 
My initiation at UCLA was being teaching assistant to Meighan,
 
who was t
eaching physical anthropology.  He was not so dull then, as,
 
.
snce h
e '
Knew little of physical anthropology,  he padded his l
ectures with
 
nec
.dc t
en, some quite funny.  He probably used the same ones on you.
 
orey has told me something of your ordeals.  She has made two
 
rs of wild pyjama trousers for Robert, who now does not have to get
 
sed all week-end.
 
It is fun having Harry home.  He bought some wonderful oriental
 
the farm in Canada.  Fortunately, being an old house it has
 
a
 living room with a door that shuts, and people don't have to tromp
 
through it on their way to everywhere.  We have rented our house for a
 
year rather than sell it.  Harry says this is economically wiser, but
 
I think he really feels as I do, that we want to leave a way open to
 
return to this crazy city, where there are  so many peo le I don't want
 
to leave.
 
I have only one class this summer, 301 or Round the World in
 
O Days, and it is trundling peacefully along.
 
Do see (where, for heaven's sake, in Colorado?) the Bob Dylan
 
mové , Don't Look Back, something like dard
 Day's Night, btt purely
 
documentary.  It t
ells you more about society today than all your
 
lectures and books.

I am writing in some anger, and I am going to send it ju st
 
as it comes out.
 In this month's SING OUT, in yo ur trib u te to Si Rady , 
a man I knew and liked and whose death you very properly commemorated
 
in SING OUT, you 4
f
t could not resist taking yet one more crack at
 
another dead man.
 Even if I were not personal y concerned, I would
 
extraordinarily bad taste, besides being both irrelevant
 
I am tired of hearing father abused for his handling of Leadbelly.
 
I don't put Fred Ramsey's article in that category at all; I do feel
 
the tragedy of Leadbelly's life must be explored
 
and analyzed.
 I do resent the multiplic tyof snide
 
I t
 cracks which I have
 
S 
 
read in SING OUT, and when one comes out with your name on it,  I do
 
protest and protest bitterly.
 
My father was a complicated man whom I do not claim to under-

R I do know that he was always doing things
 
which nobody
 had ever tried before; actually, he was a pioneer,

and pioneers/turn into peculiar and tough people.
 It's hard to love
 
them 
)but they can and, I think, must be respected, and some attempt must
 
be made to understand them.
 Frankly, you

into the pioneer category yourself, and I have spent much time defending
 
you on exactly that basis.

Dear John;
 
What with dividing my four-day trip east last month between AFS and
 
the Ethnomusicology meetin s,  I didn't get a chance to talk to von
 
about that very interesting session on Festivals.
 E
ven though I was
 
late and missed  t
oger's paper, the session as a "
ho1e was i
t hi:h ooint
 
of the meetings, as far as  I was concerned.
 
I was  articularly interested in your r! arks on the rola
.tionshin of
 
bossa nova and samba, as I have a student who wants to work on a musical
 
analysis of bossa nova and we are having great difficulty findin  him
 
suitable recordings to work from, especially anything towards the folk
 
e
rl(i of the scale.
 Would you have any time to send me a few su gesI:ions?
 
I find assomblin  discography, especially in areas f don't know anything
 
about, one of my most difficult cbnr s.
 (
I '
'or' t ment -ion rho problems
 
in locat in.  the records
 fter I
' n sure what
 wint: I f
lrs t
: thin ' first .
 )
 
At the
 •
ieetings, by the way,  I had
 
i  ln
 i
:alk with an awfully
 
bright black Indiana PhD candidate who i
s teaching Afro-Arerican
 
folk i
rusic in their Black Studies department.
 I reeotn,n
onder! your Afro-
American Ant:hronology, and it turned out she'd never heard of it.
 
he's very widely read and a whale of a hard worker (
I was tickled -
-
she makes her music students read  vth of the Nezro Past right off).
 
Anyway,  it seems to me your publishers must ho dotn  a poor job of pub-
licitv for you if she had never come across it, and I thought I
'd send
 
you some ammunition.
 Her name, by the way,  i
s  Portia Maultshy,
 he's
 
doing her dissertation on a musicological analysis via computer of the
 
melodic lines in Jackson's original white hymns as compared with the
 
black spirituals he says developed out of the
m; she thinks she's qoing
 
to cream him with his own data.
 I was really impressed with her and
 
hope to seduce her into coming to the AFS i
neetin s next year.
 
une other thing.
 Getting hack to the '
Festivals panel, am 1 mistaken or
 
I
-
jo'
c
.f
l' t there some mention of the papers being published as a special
 
volume on festival behavior?  I
'd appreciate your letting me know, as I
 
have all this stuff on the ceremonial nature of the American birthday
 
which would fit in bicely with what I hoard at your session, and I haven't
 
been able to figure out Vbat to do with it.
 It's the behavioral back-up
 
to the paper on the Happy Birthday song I read last year;  I
've boon trying
 
to decide whether to keep it all together and try for publication as a
 
monograph or  plit:  it into a couple of articles.
 This might help i
n c  c o m e
 
to grips with the problem in a more specific framework; anyway,  I
'd be
 
interested in playing with it from this point of view if you could let me
 
know what's in the wind and to whom I might submit a draft version.
 I
 
realize, of course, that the project may already be sewed up.

Thanks so much for your letter and your enclosed goodies.  As it
 
happens, I did already know bbout the Ames articles and in fact I
 
plan to include the "Protest and Irony in Negro Folksong" essay in
 
the Folk Music section.
 But it was really wweet of you to think of
 
sending me the materials.
 I could easily not have known of them and
 
I have the sneaky feeling thqt there are probably a lot more excellent
 
pieces on Negro folklore lurking in journals I've not read.
 (
I also
 
appreciate the kindness of Councill Taylor whom I had the pleasure
 
of meeting once. An awfully nice person. I'm glad to hear of his
 
Dromotion to administration though I should think such elevation
 
is a m&xed blessingi  Anyway, when you see or write Councill Taylor
 
next, please do convey my sincere thanks.)
 
Incidentally, I did locate Harold Preece who remembers the Lomax
 
family with great nostalgia and pleasure.

Dear Wayland:
 
Ivor s
ince I began my second c
areer, as a c
ollege teacher, I have f
ound
 
myself wondering f
rom t
ime to t
ime w
hat that function actually a
mounts t
o - - 
what c
onceivable s
ocial value lies in the c
ompletion of the daily academic
 
round.  It all s
e e
ms s
o amateurish s
ometimes; clearly, f
bi
' example, there
 
are many more efficient ways of distributing information than via the f
ifty
 
minute lecture.  Why then i
s i
t that, n
o matter how I an urged to "
innovative
 
teaching methods", I can n
ot se e
m to co
me V
P with a better u
se of my t
ime
 
than lecturing or chairing a s
eminar d
iscussion?
 
It has f
inally c
ome to me that '
wh
at a c
ollege professor i
s actually aupp sed
 
to d
o i
s t
o profess, in the literal s
ense of the word -
-
 t
o make profession,
 
to give testimony
-.  And i
t i
s of your importance a
s a
 vrofessor t
hat I
'd
 
l
ike t
o write here, leaving c
omment on the i
mportance of your research and
 
writing to others more e
xperienced than I
.
 
For years it has been my e
special pleasure to proffer one f
inal piece of
 
advice to students l
eaving my f
olklore classes f
or the wider f
ields of graduate
 
s
tudy at UCLA: "
Be s
ure and take a c
ourse - -  or at least s
top by and get
 
scqi*inted with -
-
 Wayland Hand."  And everyone o
f them has th
anked we later.
 
Your enthusiasm, tolerance and wisdom, yo u
r devotion to truth and tour unfailing
 
co u
rtesy, h
as brought the old phrase - -
 "
a scholar and a gentleman  -
 to life
 
f
or th e
m.  Beth in and out of the cl
assroom, you have professed to them,
 
you have given living testi m
ony to the r
igors and rewards of a l
ife of patient
 
and hard-working s
cholarship.  I
 an paraphrasing, of c
ourse, here; but s
tudent
 
after s
tudent ha. told we l
ust this.
 
I a sad that I can an longer tell s
tudents to b
e sure and take a c
ourse with
 
PNPI^W W I hope that you will allow me to c
ontinue to say, "
Stop by and get
 
acquainted with Wayland IJ 4•"  For you could give an better gift t
o UCIA than
 
your c
ontinued presence on the c
ampus as an e
xemplar of the scholarly life.
 
u
st one thing m
ore, of a
 more personal nat u
re.  A f
ew years qp a
t a
 California
 
Fo l

ting, after I bid given a brief talk, you ca
me up and hugged
 
me and said, '
Your father would have been proud of you today."  I still think of
 
that wment with deep pleasure; n

ould have -

on June 30 Professor Wayland D

the Center for the Study of Folklore and Mythology at the University of
 
California, Los Angeles and become Professor Emeritus of the University.
 
On that day we are planning to present him with a sheaf o testimonial
 
letters bound in leather.
 
If you should like to write sore words of annreciation and have then
 
included in the gift, please do so at once.
 T shoiii  Tp
 rat ' i

could have your letter by May 1

T
 
I am pleased to report that Professor Hand is enj oying the best of hea1t.,
 
and he is still producing scholarship at an enviable rate.
 Indeed, althnu i
 
he is giving up the Directorship of the Center and some of his teaching
 
duties, he is hardly "retiring" in the usual sense of the word.
 He has
 
grant-money to pursue his Dictionary of American Folk Belief and SuDersti-
tion and will be working on two tributary volumes on American Folk Medicine.
 
He already has an office assigned him by the administration for this project.
 
Please forward your reply to me in Germanic Languages and not to the Folk-
lore Center so that he will not be alerted to our nians.  '

Enclosed is the information about "Pizza Pizza" which I promised to send you.
 
The other filmo of mine on black folk music are not yet avaiiab)e for general
 
distribution, but I hope they will be soon and I
'll let you know about them
 
when they are.
 
Jerome Wenker has been out to the campus here and has pronounced our computer
 
adequate (with some reservations) for your research project.
 I
've done a bit
 
of informal checking around to see whether or not any campus laws would be
 
broken by an outlander's use of our equipment, and the general answer appears to
 
be: "not if there is some instructional value to the project".  Since, in
 
order to meet this requirement (which I think i
s a quite reasonable one) I
 
would have to fudge up some kind of a course in musicological analysis and/or
 
round up some students to do some od the work connected with the project
 
under the guise of a seminar perhaps you ought to let me know as soon as
 
possible if the whole idea stiil seems to be practicable for you.
 I realize
 
this is a busy time of year for you; we are on the semester system, though,
 
and I would have to take some kind of semi-official action at least before
 
the end of January.
 
Hope all is going well for you,

en so long since I
've seen vou..Hope you are keeping well and t
hat
 
he kids are OK. I know you all still keenly feel the absence of Butch, as we
 
i
ll will for a long time. But you I
'm sure have a full and usefull life to
 
ean on, so you're probably out there more than ever doing all the great things
 
ou do.
 
As you may know, Irwin has been Exec. Editor of the Guardian for a few
 
years now, and this keeps him under a great deal of pressure ii all the time.
 
The left is going through excruciating redefinition and realighment, all through
 
it, and the Guardian's independent role is more important than ever, although
 
hard to sustain. And the role I cut out for myself during the war has made it
 
hard to resume any commercial work with music. So I am turning to another field
 
of interest (while keeping on with my po litical singing). I have applied for a
 
grant from the Endowment 6or the Arts, to do some oral historiesof  music people.
 
So: I am writing to ask a big favor. Can you write me a letter of refecence,
 
which would indicate that you think I can do the interviews and have the auxiliary
 
capacity to turn them into books, records, etc.? Since I have no academic background,
 
I need to demonstrate that I have learned something anyway =
 
What they say in the guidelines is: "The National E dowment for the ARts has
 
initiated a project designed to create national and regional archives based on the
 
creativity and experiences of ik distinguished leaders in the development of
 
jazz/folk/ethnic msic win the US. During the 1973-73 the project will be
 
devoted to the interview of senior artists wht
h have made distinguished contributions.
 
etc.."  Also, "The applicant is responcible for having three references sent directly
 
to the Office of Music Programs--Grants Office--National Endowment for the Arts--
Washington. D
.C. 20506. References must be sent by individuals who are qualified
 
to discuss the applicant's musical ability and achievements. "  and I trust in thsi
 
case since I am not asking for a grant to do music but rather to document the
 
"senior artists" it should also mention any attributes I may have ki which RENdt
 
would contribute to my accomplishing that.
 
I found out how to apply for this thing through Alan, and he said you'd be
 
a damn good reference. I also will have letters from Pete Seeger and Studs Terkel.
 
If it comes through, I will probably coneentrate on 3-4 of the following people:
 
Mance Lipscomb, Jesse Fuller, Peter Davis (
fromxiii St. Simon's Island), Sara Ogan
 
Gunning, Jim Garland, Victoria Spivey, Sippie Wallace .
.. 
Damn, it will be hard to
 
narrow it down to what can be accpmplished. They should all be done, and so many
 
more. If you have suggestions of any other whites with the class consciousness of
 
Garland and Gunning, please let me know. Of coursed, these are supposed to he
 
"senior artists who have made distinguished contributions" but I don't know if
 
this must be synonymous with famous.
 
Well, wish I could sit down and talk to you a long while. The Bessie Jones
 
hook i
s marvelous, and will continue to have an effect on people for a long while.
 
What else are you doing?
 
Hello and love and all good things to you..

Dear Sirs:

I write in reference to Barbara Dane's applica€ion for grant monies to collect
 
the oral histories of senior artists in the field of folk music.
 
I have known Barbara Dane for many years, and my own view i
s that she i
s pecu-
l
iarly qualified to undertake such a project.  A "revival" s
inger herself (
to use
 
the British term for those artists who approach traditional music from a non-
traditional background), she s
tudied and learned from the finest native-born
 
models, so that her taste and discriminations are firmly rooted in traditional
 
aesthetics, not those appropriate only to classical music.  Many traditional
 
s
ingers, especially blues and jazz artists, are already her firm friends.  She
 
has appeared with them on concert s
tages and at festivals, and this gives her
 
an especial advantage.  She can already speak their language; she knows their
 
ways and understands their sometimes specialized frames of reference.  During her
 
active performance career, she was recognized as a significant blues singer by
 
both white and black fellow artists, and I understand that Louis Armstrong once
 
invited her on an international tour with his band -
-
 the highest possible tribute
 
to her expertise as a jazz performer.
 
Moreover, Ms. Dane has the advantage of a middle-class background and work experi-
ence.  She writes a first-class ringing prose; she i
s experienced with tape recorder
 
and microphone; she is musically l
iterate; she has done a great deal of editorial
 
work both of recordings and of print.  She i
s well-read in the overall f
ield of
 
American folk music and has contributed sensibly to academic panels at university
 
folk festivals, such as those at UCLA some years ago.
 
Above all, Ms. Dane i
s a person of determination, energy, enthusiasm and drive;
 
whatever specific project she eventually e
lects, she will complete i
t in good
 
style if i
t is humanly possible to do so.  She i
s a disciplined and responsible
 
worker; and I for one am delighted that she wants to turn her attention to the
 
documentation of the l
ife styles of some of our great traditional artists, whose
 
wisdom, experience and aesthetic philosophy are so crucial to an understanding
 
of the American experience.
 I only wish there were twenty more l
ike her; the job
 
i
s too big for one.
 
As a final comment, I would be particularly happy to see a woman working on this
 
particular project.  Both in anthropology and in folklore there have been signi-
ficant contributions by women scholars; still, as in most academic areas, women
 
have been badly out-numbered, and I suspect that our scholarly understandings
 
have thus been significantly, if inadvertently skewed.  I know of few women besides
 
myself working in the f
ield of oral history.
 I should l
ove another colleague!
 
Hawes -

In short, I recommend Barbara Dane's application to your most serious attention.
 
I hope you will feel free to call on me if there is any additional area of her
 
qualifications you would l
ike me to comment on.
 
Sincerely,

Dear Rosemary Joyce:
 
How nice of you to write me such a nice letter.  I wish I knew what
 
your particular interests were, but since I don't, I shall just go
 
ahead and take the l
iberty of sending you a copy of my latest paper
 
and hope for the best.  I
t's on a l
ocal issue but s
till you might
 
like to have it.
 
As you probably know by now, I didn't make the presidency of AFS, an
 
event which further fortifies my conviction that large congregations
 
of assorted individuals engender a really reliable collective wisdom.
 
The problems confronting AFS at this time in history are largely
 
financial and administrative; I
'm not saying I couldn't have handled
 
them, but I don't enjoy thinking about such problems very much and I
 
wouldn't have had any fun.  For Kenny, on the other hand, budgetary
 
problems are a real intellectual challenge; he adores wheeling and
 
dealing; and I think that at some very deep level the membership of
 
AFS knew this and voted accordingly.  I
'm not saying I wouldn't have
 
been pleased by the honor, but I was already honored by the nomination
 
and I really do have lots of other things to do.
 
I hope your thesis has worked out to your satisfaction.  I too am a
 
"mature student", having just completed my own M
.A. a few years back.
 
Are you going on for the doctorate?  I was very tempted but finally
 
decided not to try, since I have so many projects on the fire and not
 
all that many years to complete them in.  It would have been lots of
 
fun, though. The great advantage of going to school when you're grown up
 
is that you have the stature necessary to prevent your time from being
 
wasted, haven't you found?
 
Again, I wish you the best of success with your M
.A. and t
iani  '
.
'ou once
 
more for your kind remarks on my work.  Perhaps we'll meet at an AFS
 
meeting one day.  Or should you happen to be in Washington D
.C. during
 
the next year, please look me up at the Smithsonian, where I
'll be working
 
on the 1976 Festival of American Folk Life for a while.  Had you thought
 
ever of visiting the Festival?  This summer it runs from June 26 to July 6

Dear Alans
 
At the San Diego meetings I was chatting with my friend, Councill
 
Taylor (a black anthropologist currently on leave from S
FVSC to be
 
acting president of the State University of Now York at Old West'
 
bury, a name that exceeds even that of our institution's in
 
length and magnificence), and I mentioned your forthcoming an-
thology of black folklore.  He recently sent me the enclosed
 
articles from Science and Society with a note suggesting that
 
they might be of use to you.  Since we do not have a run of
 
S
. and So
 at Valley State, could you return the copies to me when
 
you've looked at thor
n?  I
'd like them for my own files and I
 
can't get a clear xerox from a xerox.
 
I wish they were dated, I
'd be interested to know when they were
 
written.  They include, as always, some ironies.  The "bad man
 
ballad" quoted at the end of the article "Implications of Negro
 
Folk Song" was collected by father and Alan at Parchinan years
 
ago and published for the first time in Our Si minst Country, if
 
I
'm not very much mistaken.
,
 (
I'lin writing this at home and my
 
books are at the college.)  Anyway, Ames cites it as coining
 
from The Negro Carav n as edited by Sterling Brown and Arrta
 
Bontemps
 admittedly, a more counne il faut source.
 So it
 
Anyway, I thought the articles might be of use to you ; for one
 
thing they do quote rather extensively from texts of phonograph
 
recordings, a vitally important source for data on black folk
 
song and one that should be drawn to the attention of more re-
sea rohers.
 
Will you be coming down to the meeting at Fullerton?  Michael
 
Jones has been badgertng me for a paper, and I finally said that
 
if push came to shove I could read a hunk of that paper I did for
 
you on Bessie Jones'  canto fable. 
I just reread it and still
 
dons't know quite what to make of it
 but then I never did.
 
I
t's just too pat, too neat a packaget data shouldn't behave that
 
way.
 I can't figure out how I went wrong.
 
My best to you, and all your fine students and old friands,

Dear S

You recently d
id me the favor of sending me an advance copy of
 
Guy and Candie Carawan's new book, 'Voices from the Mountains".
 
L
i
 
I have l
ong been enthusiastic about the Caravans' work, but this
 
book s
eems t
o me to reach a new l
evel, a l
evel of the highest order
 
of achievement.  I
t i
s informative, poetic and f
illed with l
ife.
 
I
t presents t
he people of Appalachia in a
ll their dignity and
 
creativity, i
t s
hows their problems, their s
trategies and their
 
achievements.  I think i
t i
s a perfectly marvellous book.
 
To put my money where my mouth i
s, a
s the o
ld saying goes, I
'm
 
asking you to send t
o me another two copies, I s
hall, of course, remit
 
payment as soon a
s the books arrive.  I
 would enclose a check but have
 
a

ear Mr. Michaelis ,

I didn't
 and stilt don't

My bunch is that in your work, especially with Dr. Bower, you
 
have already hit upon most of the bibliographical sources I
 
might be able to recommend.  In the general area of games the
 
ibliography is so extremely large, while in the specific are,
:
 
ou are interested in, it i
s so very small, that I don't quitc
 
now how to boil it down in the one case and beef it up in t

f gam es played by various ethnic groups of children, for in-
tance  however, real hard-nosed research into the relevance

f these games to the acquisition of academic learning skills

Dear Alan:
 
I came by the campus to see you a week or two ago, but you were
 
busily holding forth &t a sei inar and I uidn't have time to watt.
 OX Ty
 
to hare missed you.  The Ortho-P rchiatric neetings, by the way, were
 
exciting -
 at least they were for me.  I sat in on a s
ix hour disc saion of
 
Rule  an  Freedom -
-  Gxe  as a i
lechanisia .
or z
.;o Bevetopment in Chilu r
en
 
and ;do1e 
Beer
 ts"; B'iaxt Sutton-S m
ith was there a
iong others an.i s
poke very
 
effectively.
 
Wouh you have time to send p
ie t
te references on legend that you
 
mentioned to me at Davis?  I want to re-write the La Liorona paper in the
 
next mon t
h or s
u and get it off my mind.  On re-exa:tnation, it does need
 
r
'ore won: •  For one thing, in ord*r to fit
. the Davit, time a l
lot m
ent, L had
 
cut it to the bone, and it  staterents ueei  jerky and unreflective.  I sent
 
Alan (L.) a copy and he told x
r that he thought I had r
i.cunuerstood the
 
nature of the drama of the academic paper.  I tend to agree; the first half
 
(which I put in to satisfy myself as iell as others that I really an a
 
folk-lorist) is a bore even to its mother.  So, since I will be re-organizing
 
it, I might
  an well re-thirl it at the -
,;
a e time, k
ind a
rV suggestions you
 
have would be gr tefn1ly received.
 
I am delighted that you and your ranily are conine;
 s
outh for the
 
summer.  Leave some time open to join is on the Santa -onica beach.

Dear Alan:
 
This i
s probably an i
rregular request, but several of the informational
 
folders have disappeared from khe department's hoard of LC recordings,
 
and my students and I are going aadt
hiithout them -
-
 especially in v
iew
 
of the fact they are all Amer-Indian, a musical area in which I am not
 
exactly expert.  If they were only fiddle tunas or work songs...
 
Anyway, i
s i
t at all possible for me to beg, borrow  
,steal or purchase
 
copies of the informational material provided with the following:
 
AAFS 34  Northwest -
 Puget Sound
 
AAFS 35  Kiowa
 
AAFS 36  Indian Songs of Today
 
AAFS 41  Navajo
 
I
'd really appreciate any help you can give we on this, and of course will
 
return a check immediately if i
t's possible simply to buy them directly.
 
I
'm l
ooking forward to the fiddling session at the meetings next week;
 
we did get some nice footage of Earl Collins, by the way, showing details
 
of technique which I
'll hope to show you some day.
 
Best regards,
 
Bess Lomax Hawes

,ear Bess Hawes,
 
your letter i
s  very nice t
o
 
get. First off please remember me  to Ted
 
Carpenter, and tell him that  the article on
 
"The Bawdy Song," which caused s
o  much trou-
ble on Explorations, has now been enlarged
 
to three bigger and will be one of the  1
ey
 
chapters in my volume of erotic folklore
 
essays to appear in three weeks as THE
 
HO fV
 
BOOK (University Books, New Hyde Park, N.Y.:
 
discount to folklorists, as price i
s
 l2!)
 
If Alan i
s still in the neighborhuod, you
 
might tell him I went to his  pad on '
J
est 3rd
 
street, and fell madly in love with his sec-
retary, Dena Hirsch (who i
s a relative of
 
mine ) though I never met her before), and
 
am terrified to l
earn he i
s wor king on a
 
system of coding all fo lksong for the  IF .
 
If this  i
s true--but it can't be true'
.--
anyhow Dena denied i
t stoutly--you can tell
 
him i
t  i
s  daggers-drawn at sunset: him or '
 
I an returning separately by shipiisi
 
the index to Mrs. Paull's collection. Tb c
 
is the f
irst such collection (
of so earl ,
,;
 
a date) I ever heard of made by a wo man..I
.
 
will note to1
R
.thos e texts I
'd much li
 
to see  (most of them,  in fact,  except for
 
the p
rose texts).  I do not  ever reject n
io-
terial simply as "duplicates," and ,  in an
 
case, have seld
o m ever found two i
denti aJ 
t
cxts of n
nythinw, except from print.
 /
 
tS  \
;J  u note ,
 e bad a me rblm-
ing material from Ed Cray, but I have not
 
heard from him in quite some time and do
 
not want to write him right  now, as he had
 
offered to c
o some musical transcriptions
 
from ta p
e s I sent him, and I an afraid any
 
letter would be construed as joggling him.
 
Meanwhile, any children's materials you
 
have, sexual or sc±atological (I myself
 
never use the word pornographic, except
 
under protest, as i
t  implies  the intention
 
to cause excitement--usually not the  case),
 
would be much appreciated at any time, now
 
or when collected later. Roger Abrahams did
 
not send me a c
opy of the '
Yest Coast dozens
 
material, so  please do remind him.  I saw the
 
galley proofs of his remarkable book DEEP
 
DOWN IN THE JUNGLE, which will create a new
 
U
l
 
ra in the publication of unexpurgated folk-
ore in gen eral and Ne gro f
olklore in part i-
ular. It is  taken, with improvements, from
 
his Ph.D. thesis on Phila Negro rhymes and
 
brags, and if i
t can really be published
 
intact, in the U.S., there i
s no real reason
 
for me to  live in France, except that I can
 
find more peace here than in the Old Country.
 
Thank you f
or  t
hinking to  write to me,
 
and for wanting to be friends.  I l
ove your
 
brother,  e
ven
 aen I am fighting him, and
 
an  sure I would lve you too if I knew you.
 
I ought to tell you--which I always  tell
 
women o
Dllectors, though never men--that I
 
am a very simple and  shy guy,  a
id not at all

Dear Theresa:
 
I
've just  gotten back from the meetings to discover that I had neglected to
 
return your term paper enclosed (
front that summer class at UCLA that seems so
 
long ago nowt).  I had meant to give i
t to you when you visted the campus out
 
here, but that day moved so quickly it slipped my mind.  I
've taken a xerox
 
copy of it for my files.  I hope that's all right; if not, please tell me,
 
and I will return the extra copy as well.
 
Dr. Taylor tells me his Peoples of Africa class i
s still talking about your
 
visit with them, as are my ethnological music people.  You really did a superb
 
j
ob, and I hope you felt as good about i
t as we did.  Dr. Taylor says he has
 
never before had such an effective speaker on African affairs, and that's
 
quite a compliment coming from him; he's been teaching that course for a long
 
time now.  Really, you were just great, and I hope you'll be able to visit
 
us again soon.
 
I am writing Dr  
.Hilda Kuper to tell her how delighted we all were with your
 
presentation and to thank her for the kind loan of her f
ilm and record, also
 
to be sure she doesn't mind my having taped the recording.  Both Dr. Taylor
 
and I want to discuss with her as well the bossibilities for raising funds
 
to see that you get to some of the institutions you should visit before you
 
go back to Swaziland; that would also include a visit to my brother's place,
 
if you can call him an institution'
.  I really hope we can arrange something,
 
and I think we can if we can only get all our heads together at the same time.
 
One other thing.  I have just telephoned Dr. Robert Georges in Folklore and
 
Mythology at UCLA about you, and he told me about some courses which will be
 
offered during the winter and spring quarters which sound as though they would
 
be really useful to you.  He also suggested that if you were too bogged down with
 
requirements, perhaps you might get something by auditing than
,.  I told him I
 
would suggest that you drop by to see him, and I really think you should; he seems
 
to be most interested in meeting you and being of help in any way he can.  His
 
office is next door to the one I was in last summer; do go by.
 
I hope you'll tome over to the house  too, just for a social visit some day soon.
 
As soon as I get myself put back together after my trip, I
'll be giving you a
 
call.  However, if you have some time free before I get around to phoning, don't
 
hesitate to call me first and I
'll run over and pick you up.

P.S.  The two notes clipped to the paper are from Dr. Taylor and me respectively.

Dear Bess:
 
1
, \
 
Thank you very much for bringing to my attention the paper which
 
Nicholas Micelli did for you in connection with one of your courses at
 
Valley State.
 
This paper is like so many I myself get which fall "
betwixt and
 
between."  The thing he might have done best, namely, recording his
 
relatives, he neglected to do.  Instead of getting what they said, with
 
attendant circumstances, and all, he frequently tended to rationalize
 
their beliefs and customs in terms of what he had come to learn of their
 
background.
 
As you say, he could have looked
, at some books on the subject with
 
profit.  Most notably, he should have looked at T. F. Elworthy's, The Evil
 
Eye. This book is now back in print and is perhaps the best thing
 
available in English.
 
The final number of the Journal of American Folklore for this year
 
will carry an article, as I understand it, by one of my students, Miss
 
Alixa Naff, on the Syrian and Lebanese beliefs concerning the evil eye.
 
These were collected from people of Syrian and Lebanese extraction in
 
various centers in the United States where these people have congregated.
 
There is some little annotation, but the study rests mainly on Miss I
'
Taff's
 
collection.
 
I think the young man should be encouraged to pursue his studies for
 
those of us who are working in American folklore, it would be valuable to find
 
out which of the beliefs and customs have been brought here and kept alive
 
over the years.  It is almost useless for a student working in America to try
 
to make surveys of material as this material happens to exist in various
 
countries of Europe.  For one thing, scholars on the ground there have often
 
made these surveys and published on them.  Ideally, collections of such
 
material made here should be annotated against the local and regional material
 
collected and published in Europe.

Mrs. Tokar's paper reached me in its revised form, and it is now
 
ready to publish but for a few minor matters of form and style which
 
she can easily t
ake care of.
 
Once more, many thanks for thinking of us here.
 
Yours Sincerely,

Dear Professor Kuper:

During the temporary absence of our chairman, I
'd l
ike to thank you on behalf of
 
the whole anthropology department for lending Theresa Gininza the film and record
 
from Swaziland which she brought with her on her recent visit to this campus.
 
It was most generous of you to make them available f
or our students' enjoyment.
 
With Miss Gininza's permission, I made a taped copy of the recording of Swazi
 
music for the small archive of ethnological music I am assembling at the college.
 
I also xeroxed the album notes.  This data will, of course, only be used for
 
educational purposes on campus; however, should you feel any kind of objection,
 
I will send both the tape and the xerox to you immediately.  I admit i
t was
 
something of a high-handed procedure'
.
 
By the way, Miss Gininza l
ectured to my class ón Ethnological Music and to
 
Dr. Councill Taylor's class in Peoples of Africa, as well as contributing in-
formally to a seminar in Field Study of folklore.  She did an absolutely re-
markable j
ob in all three appearances, and my initial opinion of her, which was
 
already high, has gone even higher.  If you ever hear of any way in which I can
 
be of service to her, I hope you will let me know; she seems to me a reall out-
standing person, and I would hope that various ways could be arranged through
 
which she could get maximum benefit out of her stay in the United States.  I have
 
already written my brother, Alan Lomax, about her, for example, and he tells me
 
he would be delighted to show her the research work he i
s doing at Columbia, if
 
she could ever get to New York.  I think Alan, who has had really extensive field
 
experience in recording music, dance, and traditional narrative, might be of real
 
help to her, and I do hope shot somehow a visit can be managed.
 
Again, thanks for your help in making Miss Gininza's appearance on our campus
 
the great success that i
t was.
 
Sincerely,
 
Bess Lomax Haves

Professor Alan Dundes
 
Folklore
 
Department of Anthropology
 
University of California
 
Berkeley, California
 
Dear Alan:
 
In regard to Beverly Robinson's application for graduate study in folklore
 
at Berkeley, I can recommend her with real enthusiasm.  She is an extraor-
dinarily bright, able and talented young woman who has not, I think, gotten
 
the sort of academic t
.l.c. in the past that she both needs and deserves.
 
This hasn't held her back visibly, as her Danforth fellowship, her 3
.6 GPA
 
and her election as Chair of the Student Committee for the Arts stand witness,
 
but I suspect she carries an overload of hidden wounds, and I know she's
 
spent a lot of time and energy switching from program to program, trying
 
to find out where she fits.
 
I don't want to give you the notion that she's neurotic or tangled up; on
 
the contrary she is the most whole-hearted, non-hostile, experience-
embracing young swan I
've had the pleasure of working with for years((Get
 
her to tell you some time about her trip up the Niger on a delta steamer
 
last summer; she had wanted to go to Africa so badly that she went with
 
Project Africa for a two and a half month stay with $80.00 flat in her
 
pocket 1
)  She has enermous energy and drive; she works extremely hard; and
 
she has come to a number of important conclusions all by herself, one of
 
the most significant being that although her basic interest is in Afro-
American folklore, she is determined not to become parochial or ghetto-ized.
 
She actually sees folklore as a corrective for that tendency -
-
 an extra-
ordinarily sophisticated position for such a young woman.

My own feeling is that she can be the Zora Neale Hurston of applied folklore
 
for the 70's and 88es -
-
 she has too much physical energy to be the writer! 
U
 
novelist.  But what she badly needs -
-
 and you can give her -
-
 is the rock-
solid sureness of undebatable, self-recognized, academic success and know-how.
 
She's awfully easy to exploit, and it's happened to her at UCLA.  Program after
 
program has wooed and enticed her in to satisfy their quotas of this and that,
 
pushed her into prominent positions which she didn't really feel qualified for,
 
and then left her to sink or swim on her own.  She's made it through, and she's
 
done damned well, but her graduate career ought to be different.
 
Personally, I
'd give my eye teeth to have the chance to work with her for a year.
 
You're really lucky.
 
All the best,
 
Bess Lomax Hawes

Dear Beverly:
 
I hope this reaches you before you leave for the summer (
if that's
 
what you're planning).  I tried to phone, but your number isn't
 
listed, and I
've left several
, messages for you at the Folklore Office
 
at UCLA.  You are a hard lady to get in touch with.
 
Actually, I had assumed you would be coming to the second day of the
 
CFS meetings, so that I would have a chance to chat with you there
 
and then.  Dundes had also asked about you and wanted to meet you -
 
he is interested in getting you up to Berkeley.  Both he and I feel
 
that UCLA is the wrong place for you and would like to suggest some
 
alternatives.  Please get in touch with me before you leave for
 
the summer or make any major com mitments for graduate school.  You
 
can reach me at home evenings (
396-2982) or leave at message at
 
Ca]. State Northridge during the day (885 333l).  I'm usually away
 
from a phone when I
'm out there, but the secretaries are good about
 
taking messages.
 
Your paper was a workmanlike job, your presentation poised and im-
pressive, and I hope you appreciated th3 fact that you had one of
 
the leading fol 
k
i  
 
ore theorists in the country (Dunde ) and one of
 
the handful of top medieval scholars in the world (Friedman) working
 
with you during the discussion to help you improve ant tighten your
 
research.  I was proud both of you and of the Society; this is the
 
way real scholars are supposed to interact.
 
Best wishes to you always,
 
Your friend,

Dear Mrs. Hawes:
 
I have thought every day since my return that I would write
 
you a note and I apologize for not doing so before now,  but it
 
is the same old story -
 there has not been one minute!
 
I realize from everyone's glowing descriptions that I really
 
missed something.
 It distresses me that neither Peter nor I were
 
here during your visit.
 Your note, left on the kitchen table, made
 
me realize what a warm and enthusiastic person you must be.
 Thank
 
you for the bottle of excellent wine, which has already been con-
sumed.
 I also apologize for the state of my house which I did not
 
have time to clean up before I left.
 
Our teachers raved and raved about you and how much they
 
learned -
 all of which makes me think we must have you this summer
 
if  it is possible.
 We did not expect to invite any lecturers from
 
as far off as California.
 However, we would be prepared to pay
 
your expenses,  room and board and transportation,  for the week of
 
July 12th through Saturday the 17th and would like you to lecture
 
on either the 12th or 13th about black folk music.
 Perhaps I
 
will have contacted you by telephone before you receive this,  but
 
we could discuss the whole thing if I can catch up with you any-
where in California when I am ther
 sometime between February 23rd
 
and 27th.
 
Please accept my heartfelt thanks for the wonderful inspira-
tion you gave both the student teachers and our two Hungarians,
 
especially Kati Komlos, who is still talking about you.
 In any
 
case,  I hope it will not be long before we can meet.

Dear Bess:
 
I thank you very much for the material from your book "Step it Down".
 
I will put it to good use along with the notes I have taken myself.  I
 
enjoyed chatting with you the other day and now would like to ask you
 
several more questions.
 
(i)  I understand that E
1mna and John of the Georgia Sea Island Singers
 
will be here for several weeks later this month.  Knowing them and what
 
my needs are, do you feel they could carry on a workshop similar to the
 
one you and Bessie did2  I understand they are looking for employment
 
during their visit here.
 
(2)  During the weekend of October 1
]. and 12, 1969, the Los Angeles
 
County Music  iucators Association is planning a workshop emphasizing
 
music of ethnic minority groups.  This workshop for Los Angeles County
 
classroom and music teachers will be held at Canyon Oaks Ranch in
 
Saugus.  The Association has requested that I ask you whether or not
 
you would be able to be with the group on October 11 from 7
 to  9
:30
 p.m.
 
4
e should like you to show your film "Pizza, Pizza and Daddy 0
", discuss
 
.
t and lead the group in general folk singing appropriate for children.
 
4
e can offer an honorarium of $50 for this.  I am sure you will be
 
i
aving a busy Fall, but I hope that you can help us in this important
 
n
atter.
 
Would you be willing to reply to my questions as soon as possible so that
 
I may take your answer to a board meeting to be held in the middle of next
 
week.
 
W
 best to you.
 
Cordially,
 
Ralph Heidsiek
