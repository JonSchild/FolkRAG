As sung with great success at HARRIGAN & HART'S Theatre 
Comique, 514 Broadway, N. Y. 
Oh, the rose of Kentucky and me, 
Long ago old mosso set us tree ; 
Pll tell you what did happen in her good old mother's cabin 
To the rose of Kentucky and me. 
On the banks of the Ohio River, 
Where the winters are so cold the darkeys shiver ; 
One night about eight, we joined the married state, 
The rose of Kentucky and me. 
CHORUS. 
On the banks of the river, that old muddy river, 
She lived on the banks of the river ; 
And one night about eight, we joined the married sta,4 
The rose of Kentucky and me. 
When they tried to win my Rose away from me, 
My wife alone she said she'd be ; 
Vet their vanity she flattered, and their hearts she always shat-
tered 
When they tried to play that game on me, you see. 
tier voice filled this darkey full of glee, 
She's as merry and as busy as a 
bee ; 
lilove when I 
look at her, she's back, but that's no matter, 
_She's just the shade I'd have my daring be. 
On the Lanks of the river, etc, 
since I 
took Kentucky Rose for my wife, 
We have lived together, free from care or strife; 
And it's natural to suppose, we had a 
little Rose, 
For so sweetly flowed the summer of our life. 
Vet the winter a

When spring, suimn•.!r and autumn, too, will pass ;

YOU'LL MISS MB \VI-114:N I'M GONE, 
As Sung by Goss & Fox, at the Theatre Cot:nig OP. 
I 
am growing old and feeble. 
My hair is turning gray: 
My limbs are weak and painful— 
Are stiff, and won't obey. 
My dancing days are over, 
My pleasures are all gone; 
For goodness, not for greatness, 
You'll miss me when I'm gone. 
When I'm gone, you will miss me; 
When I'm gone, you will miss me: 
There is one kind heart will miss me, when I'm gone. 
When I'm gone, you will miss me: 
When I'm gone, you will miss me: 
There is one kind heart will miss me, when I'm gone. 
What will you do without me 
When winter time comes on? 
Who'll fold their arms about you, 
As I 
have often done? 
Who'll hug you, and caress you, 
When I 
above have flown? 
You'll know where you can find me, 
But you'll miss me when I'm gone. 
When I'm gone; ate. 
BIRDIE DARLING.

Words by V. J. ENGLE. 
Music by H, BouaLbt 
Fly across the ocean, birdie, 
Fly beyond that gloomy sea; 
There you'll find a 
truant lover, 
Who has pledged his life to me. 
Tell him how my heart was aching, 
Aching that I 
gave him pain ; 
That my pride will not allow him 
To recall those words again. 
CliORCS. 
Birdie, Birdie, Darling birdie, 
Do not tarry on the way ; 
When you hear the ocean murmur, 
Birdie, birdie fly away. 
Take with you this glossy ringlet, 
Place it on his bosom bare; 
Tell him, birdie, to remember, 
How my curls have nestled there. 
Let him call to mind the moments, 
When our hearts were both so free, 
When be pledged his life forever, 
Unto me, yes, unto me, 
Birdie, birdie, etc. 
Let him think how once hp falter'd, 
Near the window, by my side, 
When he ask'd me would I 
love him ? 
When be ask'd me for his bride ? 
Fly away, now birdie, darling, 
Stay no more to hear me sigh ; 
There now, bless you, birdie, bless you, 
Bear my message through the sky, 
Birdie, birdie, oto.

No livelier kid was ever known 
Her,majesty's country round. 
I 
cut the master short one day 
And started off alone, 
And went to swiping handkerchiefs 
Not many miles from home. 
They shipped me far away 
To a 
penal colony 
Across the deep blue water 
To the isle of Australia.. 
I 
took leg bail one day, 
couhl no longer stay; 
I 
slipped the gaol with a 
pleasant smile, 
And sailed from Botany Bay.

And that's how her I

BUFFALO. 
Written and sung by 
D. iiiftRUAAN. 
nom Buffalo I've just come down 
On the good boat Danger; 
A 
long, long trip on the Erie, boys, 
I 
feel just like a 
stranger. 
We'd heavy fogs, aaf wind storms, 
Forget 'em I 
never shall ; 
I'm every inch a 
sailor boy, 
On the E-ri-a Canal. 
Citonus. 
For the Erie is a 
using, 
And the gin is getting low ; 
I 
hardly think you'll get a 
drink, 
Till we go back to Buffalo. 
We were loaded down with barley, 
When we bid good-bye; 
When a 
pirate bore upon us, 
With an awful wicked eye. 
I 
saw him through the spy-glass, 
I 
put up a 
flag of truce ; 
I 
found it was the Three Sisters, 
Four days from Syracuse. 
For the Erie, eta. 
Three days out we struck a 
rook, 
Of Lackawanna coal; 
It gave th3 boat an awful shook, 
And stove iu quite a 
hole. 
I 
halloed to the driver, 
Ou the towpath's treader' dirt; 
He came aboard and stopped the leak, 
With Lis flannel undershirt. 
For the Erie,eto. 
ALO 
(Concluded.) 
In two yetifs we reached the Hudson, 
'We hadn't slept a 
wink; 
The crew mutinized 
Because I 
refused to drink 
Keep up your courage, then I 
cried, 
I'll bring you safely in ; 
And when we strike a 
grocery store, 
We'll swim in barrels of gin. 
For the Erie, eta. 
The storm went down, we went ashore, 
Me and Sal and Hank ; 
Greased ourselves with tallow-fat, 
And slid out on a 
plank. 
Sal is in the Poor House, boys, 
The crew are all in jail ; 
I'm the only sole surviving moke, 
Left to tell the tale. 
Srox,--So haul in your bow- line, 
Stand by your sorrel mule, 
Low bridge, boys, dodge your heads 
Don't act just like a 
fool. 
HOTEL DE VARSELAY. 
By E. HARRIO.A.N. 
Sung by all the Eastern-bound Floweys. 
I'm living at a 
boarding-house 
Up in Houston street, 
Where actors and musicians 
Eat their meals and sleep. 
There the hungry ballet tramp 
That come from Marcela 
Dancing Danish polkas 
In the Hotel Varselay. 
CHORUS. 
All night I 
am uneasy, 
No sleep at all I 
get, 
"Wid bones and clappers rattling 
And a 
Prussian clarionet. 
They never talk in English, 
But parley vous Francay, 
lose my life, upon my soul, 
In the Hotel Varselay.

To try to get up mixed up wid mud, 
They give us so us well, 
And if we drank a 
drop of it, 
We'd never live to tell. 
They give us bread that's always tread; 
Down under horses' feet, 
As a 
general rule it's army mules 
They give to us for meat, 
With fever and ague and cholera-cramp, 
An' the barber's itch. 
They throw us in an ambulance, 
Or else into a 
ditch, 
The eagle and crow, and buzzard you know, 
Fly down an' give us the claw, 
They'd eat us up, till a 
divil a

Napoleon was a 
soger, 
And the Duke of Wellington, too, 
A 
hundred thousand million men, 
All in the war they slew ; 
They'd never left a 
cripple, 
Whenever they fought the Dutch, 
They'd cut off their heads vhen they shoot 'era dead, 
So they never would need a 
crutch. 
I3ut over here when you lose an ear, 
They order you behind, 
And the pension that they give to you, 
Is an Italian organ to grind ; 
To sit out on the corner, 
An' play, " Willie Come Horne from the War,

As sung by H ATIAIGIAN & H ART. 
We joined the Yankee army, 
And went away to the war, 
To be penetrated by cannon balls,. 
And carry many a 
scar, 
When we went out we were so stout,. 
Led on by Sergeant Quinn, 
We've come home all skin and bone, 
We'd drop if ye'd say fall in ; 
There's McClinchy and McGowan, 
McSwegan and McFudd, 
McDermott and McLaughlin, 
All men of royal blood, 
O'Brien and O'Leary, 
And twenty thousand more, 
We represent the sickest galoots, 
In the'regular Invalid corps. 
Thin fall in for your castor oil, 
Before you go to bed, 
For if you're sick the divil a 
kick 
You'd make whenever you're dead; 
For every pill will surely kill, 
That they put in your jaw, 
If you lose a

You'd get in the Invalid corps.

THE RUE DE 11IDLBEEBT. 
A 
Humorous Recitation, by Eevelab 
With calm deliberation, 
Without any hesitation, 
I'll give a 
recitation 
Of the Rue de Mulberry. 
From every Gothic winder, 
You can observe its splinder, 
'Tis my duty to defincl her— 
The Rue de Mulberry. 
Its buildings are tremendous, 
The population is stupendous, 
The citizens conscientious— 
In the Rue de Mulberry., 
Men from Italiana 
Play harps and the planner, 
In a 
Lazeroner manner, 
In the Rue de Mulberry. 
Policemen from headquarters, 
Watch Italy's fair daughters, 
And the lager-beer importers 
In the Rue de Mulberry.. 
You could hear an Irish lecture, 
From the neighbors living next yer,. 
In the splendid architecture 
Of the Rue de Mulberry.

For pugilistic demonstration, 
Of men from every nation;

'Tis there the solid voters

And wear piccadilly chokers— 
In the Rue do Mulberry. 
'The perfume of the flowers, 
In the bucket shops and bowers, 
„Waft their fragrance at all hours, \ 
In the Rue de Mulberry:, 
For vast accumulation 
Of a

:No other congregation 
Equals Rue de Mulberry.

THE CONTROLLING INFLUENCE OF PRINK. 
A 
Humorous Recitation, by Enwatto TT A ILIU(1. 
In a 
tenement brick, 
Wh?re the families were thick. 
Lived McMullen, a 
poor little tailor, 
Although he was small 
At a 
party or a 
ball 
He was nimble and light as a 
•'2-
ilor, 
As a 
man, he was quiet, 
Kept out of a 
riAt, 
His nose was red al; a 
pink, 
And when ha got full, 
He was like a 
mad bull, 
From the controlling influence of drink. 
Whin the war begun 
He followed the drum. 
In the S:xty-uinth Regiment, a 
soldier, 
He went to the front 
The re'iels to bunt, 
The devil a 
troop more bolder. 
When he marched in the fight 
McMullen was tight, 
He never took time to think--
He was shot in the head 
And left there for dead. 
From the controlling influence of drink. 
.31.IcMullen had pluck, 
That's no use without luck. 
And whin they sent him to cook 
ir the nagers 
His spirit arose, 
put hi 3 
thumb to his nose 
Saying I'd see you in h-11 first, be jabers. 
In a 
cAl be was put 
Twenty two pounds to the link— 
Whin they let him go 
! 
his health was so low 
From the controlling influence of drink,.

Whin McMullen got home 
He was all skin and bone. 
Pon me sowl he poor little fellow was a

ONE day while walking down Broadway,

He asked me then if I 
with him 
To the Central Park would go. 
With my consent we then did start, 
And reached the lake at three, 
We 
took a 
sail, and words of love 
Were pass'd by Joe and me,

Sailing on the lake, 
To the music of the birds, 
The rippling of the waters 
And sounds of loving words. 
On our return we took a 
stroll, 
And soon did reach the mall 
When from the distance music sweet, 
Upon our ears did tall. 
We sat and listened to the band, 
Beneath a 
hawthorn tree, 
While gentle breezes carried words 
Of love from Joe to me. 
Sailing on the lak!.. 
Now Joe has asked me to be his, 
Of course I 
won't refuse, 
And Pa has giv n his consent— 
This chance I

And when some day at Central Park

Continued. 
My master earths me to church, 
And often I 
get blamed, 
Because I 
leave him in the lurch 
As soon as the text is named. 
I 
leave the church in sermon time, 
To walk abroad with Sally; 
She is the darling of my heart 
And she lives in our alley., 
When Christmas comes about agaite 
Oh, then I 
shall have money ; 
I'll hoard it up and bes and all, 
And give it to my honey. 
And would it were ten thousand •aollars 
I'd give it all to Sally; 
She is the darling of my heart, 
And she lives in our alley. 
My master and the neighbors all, 
Make game of me and Sally, 
And but for her I'd rather be 
A 
slave, and row a 
galley. 
But-when my seven long years are out, 
Oh I 
then I'll marry Sally ; 
Oh! then we'll wed, and then we'll bed. 
But not in our alley.

LITTLE. 
I've a 
casket at home that is filled with precious gems; 
I 
have pictures of friends dear to me, 
And I've trinkets so rare, that came many years ago, 
From my far distant home across the sea. 
But there's one sweet little treasure that Pll ever de 
prise, 
Better far than all the wealth beneath the wave; 
Tho' a 
small faded flow'ret, that I 
placed in childhood' 
days. 
'Tis a. flower from my angel mother's grave. 
CLI0RUS. 
Treasured in my n3em'ry like a 
happy dream. 
Are the loving words she gave, 
And my heart fondly cleaves to the dry and withered 
leaves— 
'Tis a 
flower from my angel mother's gnive. 
In the quiet country churchyard they laid her down 
to sleep; 
Close beside the old home she's at rest, 
And the low, sacred mound is enshrined within m 
heart, 
By the sweet ties of love forever blest. 
In the still and silent night I 
often dream of home 
again, 
And the vision ever tells me to be brave; 
For the ktst link that binds me to the place I love so 
well, 
Is the flower from my angel mother's grave. 
Treasured in my memory, etc.

wilY DIDN'T YOU SAY SO BEFORE. 
Sung by JOHNNY 13,0ACII. 
• 
New by-words you know now- a-days, are the rage, 
You'll h,ar them from every to-g,ue; 
Wherever you go you'll find that it's so, 
The little, the big, old and young, 
Even the ladies are fond of the slang, 
While the boys in the street loudly roar, 
Oh, how they do shout, the latest one out, 
Why didul you say so before I 
One day driven mad with a 
toothache so bad, 
I 
rushed to the first doctor's shop, 
When the grinder he eyed and the tongs he applied, 
And he pulled me six times round the shop; 
Said I, when he'd done, you've pulled out the wrong 
one, 
While with agony loud I 
did roar; 
Now it's done, sir, says he, the fault don't lay with me 
Why didn't you say so before I 
I 
once asked a 
friend me ten dollars to lend, 
And said : I'd return it next day ; 
When be did begin at once to rub his chin, 
And these words, unto me he did say ; 
Old boy, it's to bad. I 
should have been glad, 
In fact, I'd have LA

Had you called yesterday—now, it's all paid away; 
Why didn't you say so before I

My wife yesterday sat crying away, 
Bec tuse our first-born was a

All day she would sigh and keep rubbing hiii-eyrt; 
Instead of being happy with joy;

WHEN TITESE OLD CLOTHES WERE NEW. 
Eight years ago, I 
looked a 
swell, sirs, 
With walking cane, and purse as long, 
I 
quizzed the ladies in the street, sirs, 
Alas, that game did not last long, 
I 
married got, to my misfortune, 
From that day every penny flew, 
For soon I 
spent the marriage portion, 
On my wedding- day these clothes were new. 
We went to church, so Wyllie and merry, 
This hat of mine was new and light, 
We drank our crusted port and shery, 
And ev'ry eye was beaming bright. 
But you, poor hat, can tell the hist'ry 
Of where we, go and what we do, 
But how you stand it is a 
mysery— 
Think of the days when you were new. 
And you, poor coat, have got quite seedy, 
I 
never cuffed you speak the truth, 
You cannot say that I 
was greedy, 
I 
filled your pockets, yes, forsooth; 
For ev'ry morning you I 
studied. 
And after diuner open threw, 
And seldom were your skirts e'er muddied, 
I 
kept a 
trap when you were new. 
And you, poor boots, were bright as any, 
You re dly were a 
lovely pair, 
Cleaning you've cost many a 
penny, 
I 
took you with me ev'rywhere, 
But farewell to the soles departed— 
For my poor toes they do peep through— 
And you, poor tops look quite faint-hearted. 
How different now, than you were new.

THE OLD VILLAGE SCHOOL ON Tur, GRtES. 
Written by FRANK VAN IT F:SS for ED. Brwrort, and sung by him 
with great success. 
Oh ! I 
love the bright days of my youth to review, 
m1 fancy again I'm a 
boy, 
With my merry companions so faithful and true, 
And friendship that knows no alloy. 
Oh ! the thoughts I 
review as I 
ponder the past, 
Recalling each dear youthful sc nq; 
The one I 
most prize, and will love to the last, 
Is the old village school on the green. 
(Repeat two last lines.) 
Near the old village school the cottage still stands 
Where I 
first saw the dawn of light; 
And now over its porch in rich clustering band', 
The roses are blooming as bright 
As 'twas when with garlands and wreaths of wildflowers, 
We joyously crowned our May Queen, 
And told childish love tales in neat little bowers, 
Near the old village school on the green. 
(Repeat two last lines.) 
have left many dear and sonn.! loved ones behind 
To rest as I've journeyed along ; 
ThEre ..tre others remain just as faithful and kind, 
To join in the laugh and the song ; 
And when I 
am called by grim death to prepare, 
I 
will answer with spirit serene, 
If they'll lay me to rest when I 
breathe my last prayer, 
Near the old village school on the green.

CLERK IN A CANDY STORK 
soNd AND DANCE. 
Written by BEN COLLINS, and swig by HaaKINS & KELLy. 
Just arrived in town this morning, to see the girl that 
I 
admire; 
She is far sweeter than honey, she has set my heart 
on tire, 
She is handsome, she is pretty, she's the girl that I 
adore, 
She gets $1.80 a 
week, for she is a 
clerk in a 
candy 
store. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, Susie, you set me boozy, 
Left me lying on the kitchen floor, 
You get sassy, and give me taffey, 
For you're a 
clerk in a 
candy store. 
She used to send me baskets of rock candy, 
And often it would make me laugh 
To see the crackers and gum-drops coining 
By the American district telegraph. 
She's going to strike for higher wages, 
And says she must have ten cents more, 
To buy her a 
brand new, sky blue neck-tie. 
Tp mash the fellows in the candy store. 
Oh, Susie, etc. 
,- went to see her last Sunday evening, 
e 
whispered love on the kitchen 1-lair, 
When I 
found my ear full of maple bklgar, 
And molasses candy all over my hair. 
I 
asked her to expktin the meaning, 
I 
stamped and kicked, and, perbay. I swor' 
But the end of it all was I 
a:tked her to liv.ve 
And give up her job in the candy 'store. 
PAPA COME HOME. 
By J. W . 
KELLEY. 
The wind was howling and the storm 
Beat through the broken window glass, 
And on the floor a 
sickly wife 
Was waiting from this world to pass. 
Right beside her, little Ida 
Watched her mother's sinking eye, 
And softly whispered, God in Heaven 
Send papa home to see my mamma 
die. 
CHORUS. 
Papa, come home, papa come home, 
And she raised her little hand up high, 
Papa come home, papa come home, 
Come see my mamma die. 
No footstep came, the shoeless child 
To find him faced the sleet and rain; 
She found him stupefied with drink, 
And begged of him to come, but begged in vain. 
The drunkard struck his little daughter, 
She turned her sweet face to the sky, 
Then said, may God forgive you, papa, 
Please come home and see my mamma die. 
Papa come home, etc. 
Then she turned towards home heart-broken, 
With feet most bare away she sped, 
But when she reached the old straw mattress, 
Little Ida found her mamma dead. 
The drunkard conies, his child is dying, 
She whispers him a 
sweet good-eye--
Though you're drunk, please kiss me, papa, 
I 
only wish you'd seen my mamma die. 
Cnouns. 
Papa, good-bye, papa, good-bye! 
Oh ! the tears did blind the drunkard's eye, 
lie kissed her good-bye, then soid with a 
sigh, 
wish I'd seen your niammo, 
NEVER TOO LATE TO MEND. 
Written by Cuas. ARCHER, sung by VERNIE VERNON. 
It Oft has been said that a 
man once a 
thief, 
A 
thief he must always remain; 
Such sayings as tlies3 are as truthless as brief, 
And always, I 
own, give me fain; 
For there's many a 
man, by society banned, 
Has been thrown into crime without end; 
So, don't judge too harshly—remember the while--
That it's never too late to mend. 
CHORUS. 
So, be lenient to those who have strayed from the 
path, 
And a 
little sweet charity lend, 
Remember the good old Samaritan law, 
That it's never too late to mend. 
There's whiskey, the curse to our nation and land. 
And that though we try to defend, 
The laws that are made are made but to break, 
For the sinner's and publican's end; 
For a 
drunkard's a 
curse to himself and his friends, 
So, don't pious horror pretend, 
For who knows the hard struggles he's made to 
reform, 
For it's never too late to mend. 
So, be lenient, etc. 
%ker.° are the nymphs of the pave, each one the slave 
Of whoever has money to purchase her love; 
How hard is their fate, how sad istheir state, 
Denied hope on earth and above; 
If Christians would cordially welcome them baek, 
And not pious horror pretend, 
There are souls to be saved that by vice are enslavoi, 
And it's never too late to mend. 
en be lenient, etc.

PASTRY COOKS' 
BALL. 
Written by BEN COLLINS, and sung by LEw FlAwsiss, of HAwsn's 
KELLY. 
If you listen a 
while to a 
song I 
will sing you, 
I 
feel very certain ' twill cause you to smile; 
It happened of late in the town of Chicago, 
And I'll sing it to you in a 
musical style. 
'Twas the Chambermaids' Ball and Hash-Slingers' Party, 
That was given by them at the big Turner Hall, 
A 
bass drum and band of four Italian fiddlers 
Played the Blue Danube Waltz at the Pastry Cooks' Ball. 
Oh the dancing began in the shank of the evening, 
Theodore Thomas was there, and called out the quadrille, 
Tony Pastor was there, with a 
one-dollar diamond, 
And was trying- his best the young lad:es to kill. 
Hamlin came in at the gray of the morning, 
He kissed all the chambermaids, big, fat, and tall; 
A 
waiter from the Delmonico gave him a 
ham sandwich— 
He smelt it, and died at the Pastry Cooks' Ball. 
Gus Peters came in with a 
new linen duster, 
With a 
Southern young lady from Fourth Avenue, 
He said she went through him and took twenty cents 
He was saving to buy one of Scott's oyster stews. 
Then Beecher, the Champion Masher, of Brooklyn, 
Got in trouble with Elizabeth while arranging her shawl, 
And Barnum, the skeleton, busted his boiler, 
He was too thin to dance at the Pastry Cooks' Ball. 
Little Mac, so short, came in with a 
beer keg, 
Frank Lewis. the singer, walked in on a 
check, 
And Frencli:y-, who murders the pie box, on State Street, 
Slipped down on a 
banana skin and near broke his neck; 
Delehanty and Henglt r 
fell in a 
cistern, 
They were hung upon a 
peg to dry on the wall; 
Pat Rooney kicked his Dutch leader in the stomach, 
And started a 
fight at the Pastry Cooks' Ball. 
Talk about slinging, but that was the darling, 
And Sankey got hit with a 
hot apple dump; 
Billy Hayle, the dancer, grabbed a 
rotten tomato, 
And hit Weston, the pedestrian who died on the jump. 
John Riley fell through the bass drum and fiddle, 
The gang yelled " Police!" but it was only a 
stall, 
The head of a 
girl from the Bon-Ton took on fire, 
And burnt Shaw Andrews' pants at the Pastry Cooks'
