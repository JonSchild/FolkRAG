Dundes response to thesis:
 
Pess Hawes "Happy Birthday: An American f
litual" charring,
 
fascinating, should probably be submitted to UC Press for
 
consideration as a folklore monograph.
 
.
..An exciting and emjoyable thesis.
 I can't remember when
 
I
've read anything with such great pleasure.
 The rewritinci
 
and revisions are excellent and the whole thesis hangs to-
gether much better now.
 There's no doubt that it deserves
 
publication.
 The only question is whether to break it
 
up into articles or to go for a monograph.

UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA
 GRADUATE DIVISION, BERKELEY
 
INSTRUCTIONS FOR PREPARING AND SUBMITTING THESES AND DISSERTATIONS
 
FOR HIGHER DEGREES
 
1
. Filing of theses and dissertations
 
a
.
 Dates for filing. Dates for filing with the committees in charge and with
 
the Graduate Division are announced each year in the official University
 
Calendar; they may also be obtained from the Office of the Graduate
 
Division.
 
It is the responsibility of the student to inform himself about these
 
dates.  The last day for filing with the Graduate Division has been set so
 
as to provide the minimum time needed to prepare and process the degree
 
list before it is acted upon by the Academic Senate.
 For this reason, this
 
adline must be strictly observed.
 
For convenience in filing, the thesis or dissertation (unbound, unless
 
it is a published book) should be placed in a large Manila clasp envelope
 
clearly marked with the name of the candidate and the degree for which he
 
i
s working.  Do not punch h
oles in t
he l
eft-hand margin.
 
b.  Title page. The official title page for the original copy must be secured
 
from the Graduate Division Office after the student has filed his final
 
notice of intention to complete requirements.  This title page is to be
 
signed by members of the committee who approve the thesis.  No duplicates
 
of the title page are provided, but the student may prepare duplicates if
 
he wishes.
 
c
 Summaries of doctoral dissertations. Every doctoral candidate must prepare
 
in duplicate an abstract of his dissertation, to be filed with the disserta-
tion itself.
 Instructions concerning proper form can be obtained from the
 
Office of the Graduate Division.
 If a final examination is to be held,
 
information about the place and date of the examination must be supplied
 
at the time of filing.
 
2
. Number of copies
 
One approved copy (
the original, if typewritten) is to be filed in the Office
 
of the Dean of the Graduate Division for later deposit in the University
 
Library.  This copy, which will be reproduced subsequently on microfilm, must
 
conform to the terms of these Instructions.  The student should consult his
 
graduate adviser to find out whether additional copies are required by his
 
department.
 
3
. Printed material
 
The thesis or dissertation may be presented wholly or partly in printed form,
 
provided that the writer of the thesis is the sole author of the published
 
material submitted.  Reprints of articles should be submitted intact, not cut
 
or pasted on other sheets of paper.  A candidate planning to submit printed
 
materials is advised to consult the Office of the Graduate Division in advance
 
of preparing his thesis in final form.
 
-2-
4
.  Processed material
 
a
.  A thesis prepared by any one of a number of processes may be accepted,
 
provided that it meets all of the following conditions:
 
1)  it must be readable;
 
2)  it must be capable of photographic reproduction;
 
3
)  the ink must be reasonably permanent;
 
)
)  the paper must be of durable quality, and not subject to
 
discoloration;
 
5
)  only one side of paper may be used.
 
b.  Because of the variety of trade names, it is not possible to give a list
 
of acceptable processes.  The candidate should consult the Graduate
 
Division Office c
oncerning the acceptability of any process he is planning
 
to use.  Even though a process is acceptable on other grounds, the copy
 
submitted will be rejected if it is not clear and legible.
 
c
.
 The following processes are not acceptable:  Ditto, Hectograph, Thermofax,
 
blueprint.  These are mentioned because they are widely used for other
 
purposes; they are not a complete list of unacceptable processes.
 It is
 
the responsibility of the candidate to inquire about the acceptability of
 
a process he is thinking of using.  Mimeograph is not acceptable unless
 
reproduced on good quality bond paper.
 
d
.  For instructions concerning size of paper, spacing, typographical correc-
tions, margins, plates, maps, and so on, see below, relating to typewritten
 
theses.  The same conditions apply to a thesis prepared in processed form.
 
5
. Typewritten theses or  issertations
 
a
.  Only one side of the paper may be used.
 
b.  Paper. The paper should be of standard size, 8 1/2 x 11 inches, unpunched
  
and of good grade.
 It is recommended that 1
6 lb. paper be used, but
 
weights ranging from 13 to 20 will be accepted.
 
Exceptions regarding size and type of paper may be made in certain
 
fields -
-
 for example, music, design, and landscape architecture.  A
 
student planning to submit a thesis that does not meet the standard
 
requirement should consult the Graduate Division Office in advance of
 
preparing his thesis in final form.
 
c
 Margins. For binding, a margin of at least 1 1/2 inches is required on the
 
left side of the page.  The minimum margin at the top, bottom, and right
 
side is one inch.
 
d
.
 Spacing. D
ouble spacing should be used in typing the thesis, except in
 
those places where conventional usage calls for single spacing -
-
 for
 
example, footnotes, indented quotations, tables.
 
e
.
 Corrections. Correction of typographical errors should be made with care.
 
Pages with illegible or unsightly changes, or with changes likely to be
 
unclear in photographic reproduction, will be rejected and the candidate
 
will be required to replace them.
 
-3-
f
.  Numbering of pages. All pages should be numbered consecutively, preferably
 
in the upper right-hand corner about 1/2 inch from each edge.  This number-
ing should include pages consisting of plates, figures, maps, and so on.
 
The descriptive page immediately preceding figures or plates should not be
 
reversed so that it faces the figure page, but should be paginated in
 
conformity to the other pages of the dissertation.
 
If material is inserted after typing, it should be numbered, for
 
example, 21a, 21b, and so on, if it follows page 21.
 If a numbered page is
 
later removed, a numbered page, blank except for the notation 'lacking in
 
numbering only" should be inserted in the proper place.
 
g
.
 
Plates, figures, illustrations. Plates or figures should be the original
 
photographs or drawings, or photographic or photostatic reproductions of
 
the originals.  Plates reproduced by a lithographic process (for example,
 
Multilith) or by diazo or ozalid are also acceptable.  Photographs should
 
be positive prints.
 Line drawings or tabular material reproduced by photo-
graphy should be positives.
 If drawings, graphs, symbols, etc., are done
 
by hand, black ink should be used, preferably India ink.
 
If a plate is smaller than the standard 8 1/2 x 11 inch page, it should
 
be attached to a blank page of standard size with dry mounting tissue or
 
library paste.
 If library paste is used the whole back surface should be
 
covered.  The weight of the paper on which the plates are mounted may be
 
slightly heavier than Bond paper, but not as heavy as cardboard.  D
o not u
se
  
rubber c
ement, Scotch t
ape, mucilage, or photo-corners t
o attach plates.
 
These are cited because they are well known; they are not a complete list of
 
unacceptable methods.  The student should inquire about the acceptability of
 
any other method he is thinking of using.
 
Tables, charts, and plates that are larger than 8 1/2 x 11 inches
 
should normally be reduced to standard size by photographic process.
 In the
 
rare cases where this is not feasible, the Graduate Division Office
 
should be consulted about the proper way to submit them.
 
h.
 Size of type. Any size or face may be used, but it must be uniform
 
throughout.
 
i
.
 Style. The student will be guided on matters of style by the chairman and
 
members of his thesis committee.
 So far as the Graduate Division Office
 
is concerned, footnotes may be inserted in the text or placed at the bottom
 
of the page, or assembled in one or more sections, but the committee in
 
charge may restrict the student's option in this respect.

This is to reaffirm our strong interest in having your
 
splendid paper on "Happy Birthday to You: An American Ritual"
 
for the Journal of the Folklore Institute.
 
It seemed to me that in the form in which you presented
 
it the paper would fit very well into our format.  Perhaps you
 
might want to publish it in two forms, as an extended monograph
 
and as a more s
ummary article.  In any event I do wish to
 
congratulate you on a masterpiece.
 
Sincerely yours,

Dear Bess:
 
As editor of Western Folklore, I was
 
greatly interested in the paper,  "Happy
 
Birthday to You:  An American Ritual,"
 
which you presented at the recent meeting
 
of the American Folklore Society in Los
 
Angeles.
 We cannot,  of course,  guarantee
 
publication,  but if you wish to submit it,
 
we shall give it immediate consideration
 
and furnish a prompt opinion.

Dear Dr.  Hawes:
 
I am on the brink of a vacation but didn't want to
 
leave before dictating an explanation for the tone of my
 
previous letter.
 
When your  first letter arrived,  we were following up
 
an infringement  (now satisfactorily resolved),  one of the many
 
attempts to evade the copyright to "Happy Birthday to You."
 
You would be amazed at the ruses people use to try to find
 
some grounds for avoiding payment for commercial use of this
 
song.
 I imagine you now understand why we leave all dis-
cussion of the legal intricacies of this copyright to our
 
attorneys and those for the Hill Foundation  (the Hill sisters'
 
heirs).
 
There have been many articles written about  "Happy
 
Birthday to You,"  some more accurate than others.
 As I
 
remember,  the one in THE NEW YORKER is the best.
 If your
 
paper doesn' t need to be finished until after Labor Day,
 
please let me know and I'll be happy to go through our files
 
when I return and give you a list of further references you
 
'
 not have run across.
 
Cordially,

Dear Bess:
 
I looked for you on Sunday in Austin to return the enclosed tape
 
to you, but could not discover your whereabouts.  Hence I am
 
sending the tape back to you by mail.  Many thanks for your loan.
 
I enjoyed listening to it.
 
At present, I am hard at work on an introductory anthology of
 
folklore readings, and am wondering if I might have your permiss-
ion to reprint your articles on "La Llorona at Juvenile Hall" and
 
"Happy Birthday" as part of the collection.
 I am looking for solid
 
case studies of folklore in the American context which balance
 
good scholarship with reader appeal, and as I told you in Austin am
 
much impressed with your work.
 I hope to have the ant1- ology into
 
print by the end of next year, have a possible publisher in line,
 
and about 1/3 of the work (notes, introductions, etc.) done so far.
 
Since what I am doing to one degree or another is copied concept-
ually rather easily I did not mention the anthology widely or in
 
much detail to most people at the meetings, but I have now begun
 
to approach at least those peoples with unpublished manuscripts
 
I am interested in.  Hence this letter.
 
If you are willing to let me use your "Happy Birthday" essay (
and
 
I do hope you are agreeable), would you be kind enough to send me
 
a copy of the manuscript so I can begin work on the notes to it.
 
And I would also appreciate the bibliographic reference to the
 
book you did with Bernice Reagon on children's songs and games
 
which I heard about at the meetings, also any data on other books
 
you have published or have in press.
 
Cordially,

Dear Josephine:
 
Enclosed herewith is a rather beat-up copy of a manuscript I
'd l
ik  tr
 
consult you about.  Actually, it's my M
.A. thesis written several years
 
ago for the University of California, Berkeley, and preserved there for
 
future generations on microfilm.  It was a jeu d
'esprit -
-
 written with
 
my tongue firmly in my academic cheek -
-
 but I
've delivered a number o
 
talks s
ince (
both to scholarly and lay audiences) on the eopic, and the
 
favorable reaction has been so striking that I think I should do s
omething
 
more with the material covered.  Peonli' seem to be really i
nterested.
 
The quest i
on i
s: what?  I
t seems to me i
t e
ither has t be '
h  1
 r
 •mwn
 
or fattened up, and in either case, some of the obvious thesis type of
 
writing has to be redone.  I
've thought of going two different routes:
 
shortening it and making it the lead essay in a book of essays on chilirens
 
folklore would be one possibility.
 (
I already hive several o
ther nie
ces
 
that could be included and could do more.)
 
The other strategy -
-
 add the one which appeals to me more on alternate
 
Thursdays (
as this happens to me) -
-
 i
s to put in another few months'
 
research and try to get it published as a small book all by itself, perhaps
 
through the monograph series of a university publishing house or through one
 
of those small houses that specialize in odd books on odd topics.
 (
There's
 
a book by James H
. Barnett put out by Macmillan, called "The American
 
Christmas: a Study in National Culture" that is the kind of thing I mean.)
 
I think the reason I am currently leaning towards this alternative i
s that
 
the whole fun of the thing, it seems to me, is the spectacle of how far you
 
can go playing around with a single folkloric item -
-
 the whole deal is a
 
kind of miniature twentieth-century Golden Bough -
-
 very old-fashioned but
 
kind of a kick.  I
t could even he sub-titled "A Folklorist's Journey" or
 
something of the kind.
 
However, I don't want to put in all this work without some notion as to whether
 
or not it might be a publishing possibility, so I thought I would consult with
 
you on the matter.  I
'll be coming in to New York around April 1
5th to work
 
in Alan's office for a month or so, so I
'll give you a call after I get in.
 
In the meantime, by the way, Fran has seen it.  I left it overnight after I
'd
 
dropped by to see her this past summer, and the topic came up.  I think she
 
rather prefers alternative number one, but we really didn't discuss it thoroughly.
 
Anyway, see what you think; and, for Pete's sake, don't show it around, as it
 
is in no sense available a
s is; I realize I
'd have to completely recast i
t,
 
whichever way it goes.

Dear Sirs:
 
I am a professor at San Fernando Valley State College where I teach several
 
courses in American folk and popular music.  I have recently become interested
 
in the song "Happy Birthday to You", to which I believe your film holds
 
copyright title, and am in the process of preparing a report on it for an
 
academic journal.  There are several difficulties I have run across in the
 
course of my research, and I should greatly appreciate it if anyone in your
 
office could take time to clarify them for me.
 
1
)  As I understand it, the melody first appeared (with a different
 
lyric) under the title "Good Morning to All" in Song Stories for the Kindergarten
 
and Primary School (Chicago, 1
893), with l
yrics by Patty Smith Hill and words
 
by Mildred S
. Hill.  According to James S
. Fuld, your firm, then known as the
 
Summy Company, published a tune under a new title "Happy Birthday" in 1
934;
 
however, Sigmund Spaeth says that "Happy Birthday to You" was sung in Irving
 
Berlin's As Thousands Cheer, which opened in 1
933, and that your firm was
 
successful in claiming royalties from the producers.  Was the decision based
 
on the earlier copyright of "Good Morning to All", or was "Happy Birthday to
 
You" actually copyrighted prior to 1
934?  Did the issue come to a court trial?
 
I would appreciate any l
eads you can give me for further research on this or on
 
any other l
itigation in which this song appeared.
 
2
)  An article in the New Yorker (March, 1
941) states that the Summy
 
Company at that time was bringing pressure on Postal Telegraph and Western Union
 
to pay royalties for the use of the song in singing telegram service.  I have
 
been unable to trace this matter any further.  Was an agreement finally reached?
 
Is it still in effect?
 
3
)  Could you confirm the information I have from ASCAP that only the
 
lyrics of the song are now under copyright, the melody having passed into
 
public domain?  Did the 1
934 copyright cover only new l
yric l
ine?
 
I am afraid this l
etter rather presumes on your time, and I hope that there is
 
someone in your office who is already sufficiently familiar with this song's
 
history and that too much research will not be necessary in order to answer it.
 
I will greatly appreciate any of the above requested information that you can
 
give me, and am enclosing a stamped self-addressed envelope for your reply.

wrong way.  I am a folklorist teaching in a department of anthropology.  I
 
came across a reference to the authorship of "Happy Birthday to You" in while
 
investigating a problem in connection with a course I teach in American Folk
 
Song, and it simply piqued my curiosity.  Like many other people, I had
 
assumed it was a traditional song of anonymous authorship, and I was surprised
 
t
 it,
 had such a venerable and complex publication history * 
currently intend to read a paper at the next meeting of -
.
,e 
•
 merican  olkiore Society which will center on oral parodies of the "l
lap'
 
Birthday" song collected by students in my folklore classes, during whic
 
will touch on the history of the original song.  This paper may or may n:
 
prove to be publishable; if it is, I shall

Though I will undoubtedly noc use al

a

of the story as possible in order to be sure that what I do may is accura  .
 
For example, the reason that I enquired specifically about legal actions
 
involving the song is that Spaeth simply says that many lawsuits oentere
 
around it.  I can find no confirmation of this anywhere else and (ahou

in a normal way through the use of standard library references, interviewe,

Dear Dr.  Hawes:
 
We are somewhat puzzled by the questions
 
in your  letter of August 4 concerning "Happy Birthday
 
to You."
 In turn,  we would like to ask some questions
 
of our own.
 For which academic journal are you pre-
paring an article?
 Presuming that it is in the field
 
of anthropology, what relation do the legal technicalities
 
of this copyright have to your subject area?
 Finally,
 
what is the source of the incorrect information which
 
you say you obtained from ASCAP?
 
Sincerely yours,
 
SUk4MY-BIRCHARD COMPANY

 "The Three Top Songs of All Time".
 VARIETY, January 10
 
' -'
 1962. p
.  184.
 
(The three are:  "Happy Birthday to f You",  "We Won't Go Home Until
 
i
orning" and "Auld Lang Sync".)
 
The article begins:
 
It is now a recognized fact that our popular songs provide the
 
best possible index to the manners, customs and general characteristics
 
of each generation of Americans, including even the clothes,  the slang,
 
the jokes and the current events of the day.
 But if one trieds to select
 
three or four numbers that have been sung more often than any others in
 
our history, one is likely to find thor
n all of the convivial type, having
 
no topical significance, but definitely adapted to celebrations, occasions
 
and anniversaries of all kinds, when people almost automatically break
 
into song.
 
Such a list would not include any of the lyric inspirations of
 
S
tephen Goster or "Home, Sweet Home" or "Diacie" or even the "
Star Spangled
 
Banner" which is frequently played under compulsion, as our national
 
anthem (
since 1931) but hardly every sung by more than a solo voice.'
 
Actually, the song that has been heard most often in this country
 
(and perhaps in Europe as wel) is a simple unpretentious little two-line
 
ditty originally eals called "Good N rning to All".
 We know it best as
 
"Happy Birthday To You", but it can  xk express equally well such a wish
 
as "Happy New Year",  "Merry Christmas" and even "Happy Anniversary".
 
It was written in 1893 by two New York school teachers,  the sisters
 
v
jldrod and Patty Hill, and for many years it was believed to be a folk
 
song and therefore "in the public domain".
 A number of people discovered
 
this to be a costly error, including Irving Berlin who quite innocently
 
used the song in "As Thousands Cheer" to celebrate the birthday of John
 
D
. Rockefeller.
 It is now free to all, having long passed the copyright
 
limit of 56 yvars and will probably  continue to be sung indefinitely at
 
parties, in pubs and taverns, in restaurants or wherever an anniversary
 
of any kind may demand attention.
 Incidentally, R
idapy "Happy Birthday"
 
is generally pitched too high, since the singers forget about that octave
 
jump in the middle.
 The key of G is about right for average voices."

 The second part of this survey may appropriately begin with thE
 
question of birthday celebrations among the Jews.
 There is no clear
 
reference to such celebrations among the ancient Hebrews in the Old
 
Testament.
 The mention of the "
day of our king" in Hosea 7:5 may
 
quite naturally be taken to refer to the anniversary of the king's
 
accession to the throne, and the other passages quoted in J  iii
.  2
21
-
are still less decisive.  (

 footnote)
 
(
1.
 The occasion of the feasting referred to in Job 1:4 f i
s not
:
 
clear.
 As the seven days appear to have been consecutive,  they could
 
hardly to have been birthdays.)
 
p
.  806 continued.
 The only clear reference to a birthd;v fest -ivity in
 
the Old Testament is found in Genesis 40:20, and relates to the Egyptian
 
Pharoah.
 The birthday celebrations in the Herodian family (
see Jos.
 
Ant. xix, vii 1
; Mt 14:6) were, no doubt, :
kx an imitation of the Graeco-
Rpman customs of the time.
 All one can say of Jewish feeling about it
 
in medieval times is that the birthday celebration of a private person
 
among pagans lay under a minor kind of ban,  its connections with ido1at:rou
 
worship not being considered pronounced enough to warrant the cessation
 
of all business connection with the pagan concerned for three days pre-
ceding the festivity,  so that the ban lay only on the day itself.
 (See
 
Malmonides, Nishneh Torah, ch.  ix)
 (

-
 footnote)
 In modern times
 
however, Jews very largely adopt the custom of birthday celebrations frnn
 
their neighbors.

after "mark the solstices"
 
footnotes  Religious calendars need not be based only on reco
 
nigion of the solstice points.
 Other regularly recurrent events, such
 
as the equinoxes,  the onset of dry or rainy seasons, or the annual
 
flooding of particular streams, may also signal the time for fixed
 
supernatualistic celebrations.
 Concerning this matter in general, Alfred
 
Netraux points out that the Chiriguaro of South America used the yearly
 
course of the Pleiades "to reckon time".
 (Handbook of South American
 
Indians, J.H. Steward, ed.
