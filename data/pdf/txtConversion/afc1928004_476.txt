THE POOR WORKING GIRLS, 
Burlesque on " Many Can Help One," by FRANK FIELDS. 
NEW sayings we hear every day in the week, 
And one-half I 
believe•to be lies. 
While the rich man is feasting on peanuts each day, 
The poor man is starving on pies. 
I'll sing of the poor working girls in my song, 
Who can't afford silk dresses to buy, 
Their clothes are all sunburnt, their false teeth in pawn, 
To get money their eyebrows to dye. 
onout_Ts. 
Remember my sayings when you are dead drunk, 
And counting your dimes by the penny. 
Remember you have suspenders and chest protectors a:; 
well, 
While the poor working girl hasn't any. 
In walking through the business street of this great town, 
These poor girls you will meet by the way ; 
Working from seven in the morning till eight o'clock at 
night, 
And all for ten dollars a 
day. 
It's a 
shame in a 
country that owns she is free, 
That assistance there cannot be lent, 
The poor girls have large families of children to support. 
I 
hope I 
don't intrude. 
Remember my sayings, etc. 
I 
LOVE jAKEY. 
DUTCH SONG. 
Written for W ATSON and 1.

A.,Lr, by W M. J. 
SOANL07.I. 
I'LL sing of a 
Deitcher boy, a 
boy who loves me, 
You peoples must all know him well. 
He sells sausages in all the saloons, 
He's the owner of a 
sausage hotel. 
He can sing, he can dance, he can play the trombone, 
The finest you ever did see, 
He drinks lager beer to make himself fat, 
And he loves to eat good bologne. 
CHORUS. 
I 
love Jakey, I 
love Jakey, 
And Jakey he loves me, 
We eat pretzels, drink lager beer, 
Vero ever we may be. 
(
Repeat.) 
To-night he is coming here to see me, 
Ve'ro going to a 
masquerade ball; 
Yen I am dressed up in my fancy clothes, 
You bet I'm the belle of them :d1. 
And venever my Jakey is by my side, 
how happy I 
always do feel, 
We sing the sweet songs of our fa,derland, 
Then around on this floor we do spiel. 
I 
love Jakey, etc.

ISADOR A13 RAMS, THE LAWYER. 
Written by JACK Qt.TINLAN expressly for FRANK BCS1I, and sung by 
him with great success. 
Oa, I

Sheeny counselor,

CHORUS.

My influence vit dem is great ; 
No matter when my case is called, 
If I

And if de judge don't send you up, 
I'm sure I'll get you free.

THE CURLY HEADED HASHER. 
BANJO SOLO. 
Wtitten. by ROY LESLIE for BILLY CARTER. 
I'LL sing a 
song of a 
nice young man, 
Who thought himself a 
masher, 
He told the girls he was clerk in a 
bank, 
But the truth he was a 
hasher. 
He would work from sunrise in the morn 
Until his lunch was over, • 
Then he'd dress himself up in a 
ten dollar suit, 
And he'd go out on the mash, sir. 
CHORUS. 
He was born in the Fall, 
This man with a 
gall, 
So loud he would bawl 
For hash through the hall. 
He laid over them all 
And he'd run them to the wall ; 
And he never would fall, 
This curly headed hasher. 
One day when the matinee was out, 
He met a 
charming lady ; 
He called her his love and turtle dove, 
And then she called him baby. 
Some time after this to his hotel 
\Vent this charming lady, 
And she saw her mash a 
slicing his hash, 
On her head he spilt some gravy. 
CHORUS. 
-When he saw his mash, 
He dropped with a 
crash 
A 
plate full of hash. 
From her room he did dash, 
As quick as a 
flash ; 
He shook his mash 
As quick as a 
flash, 
This curly headed hasher.

KIND FRIENDS' 
TO ALL. 
Words and music by HABEY Mourns. 
Suit; by NED 3ABI1Y. 
KIND friends, your attention 
ask for awhile, 
And a 
few things to you I 
will say. 
Of a 
maxim that's bright, ani a 
lesson for all, 
As we journey on through life each day. 
Use all men alike, make no exception, 
The rich, poor, the short and the tall, 
And a 
Golden Rule you will find in these words, 
Be a 
good and a 
kind friend to all. 
CHORUS. 
Accept this for that, it is worth all I 
ask, 
Let Excelsior be your password and call, 
And remember it is very easy to be 
A 
good and a 
kind friend to all. 
That poverty is no disgrace we all know, 
But bitter its sting is to bear, 
To-day may ho dreary, dismal and dark, 
To- morrow by chance may be fair, 
So help one another, mind luipi)y 
b• ,. 
Let scruples rest here, let them fall ; 
Far better than riches these few words resound. 
-
Ile is a 
good and a 
kind frimmi t ) 
Accept this, etc. 
In this life a 
mission we all do porform, 
So lot yours be exact : mud trim, 
Do then unto others as you would have them, 
-Unto yours and yourself to do. 
At the end of this life, without fear when you hear 
The great Maker's trumpet's loud call, 
You can look in His face, for there's sure a 
reward, 
To a 
good and a 
kind friend to all.

I AM a

All the Rabbi politicians 
Thinl I

I

I'll have motzers raised to one dollar a

When -Moses Donohue is Mayor. 
CHORUS. . 
I'll have Sheenys turn out on Patrick's Day, 
To interfere the Irish won't dare ; 
give Sheeny crackers for Christmas rackets, 
When Moses Donohue is Mayor. 
I'll stop the East River from running then, 
The Brooklyn 'Bridge I'll raffle off ; 
There'll be a 
chromo with every custard pie, 
You'll get a 
dollar every time you cough. 
I'll build it fence around New York, 
You'll get ten years if you go on a 
tare ; 
You'll have to walk on your hands to save your shoes, 
When Moses Donohue is Mayor. 
I'll have Christmas three times every month, 
Then you'll see the sheenys stare ; 
They'll be houses on the Elevated Road, 
When Moses -Donohue is Mayor.

Little Robin, tell Kitty I'm coming, 
Yes, tell her to meet me for sure ; 
Oh, say I'll await in the gloaming, 
With love ever constant and pure. 
How bright is the bloom of the flowers, 
Bedecking the sweet new-mown bay; 
While up in the blue heaven's bowers 
Rings sweetly the nightingale's lay. 
Yes, Robin, tell Kitty—

My love she is a

About her face no paint is seen ; 
Her pretty foot is very small, 
But very large is her waterfall. 
Her ankle, too, so plump and fat, 
It makes my heart go pit-a-pat. 
Were I

I'd stay all da,y .and sip and sip. 
Oh, she never flirts—she'15 no coquette ;

Gents are bewildered, and gaze at me, too ; 
Some criticise me and stare while they say,

"Come Sit by my Side, Little Darling." 
Come sit by my side, little darling, 
And lay your brown head on my breast, 
While the angels of twilight around us 
Are singing  
"The Irish Jaunting Car." 
My name is Larry Doolan, I'm a 
native of the soil, 
If you want a 
day's divarsion, I'll drive you out in style ; 
My car is painted red and green, and on the door a 
star, 
And the pride of Dublin city is  
"It's Just my Style." 
A 
darling little girl in town 
I 
met the other day ; 
She was so pretty, sweet and nice, 
It took ray breath away ; 
I 
would have fallen deep in love 
Had she not given a 
smile, 
And whispered  
" 
Josephus Orange Blossom." 
Oh, my name it is Josephus Orange Blossom, 
I'm the gayest colored gentleman in the land, 
With the pretty girls I 
always play the possum, 
I'm it red-hot hunky dory contraband. 
When I 
first foil in love with Jane 1‘,161isa, 
I 
tried my best to win her with a

Said she,

THE IRISH EMPERORS. 
Written and sung with great succes by FAVOR and SHIELDS. 
HERE we are, a 
pair of Irish emperors, 
From the Emerald Isle, across the raging sea, 
In a 
steamship we crossed the briny water, 
And sailed here to America. 
When we landed down at Castle Garden, 
There was no one there to take us by the hand ; 
.But now sure we don't care a 
farthing. 
We're the happio4 little Paddies in the land.

We sailed from the town of Tipperary, 
In the laud where the shamrocks grow ; 
Mighty soon we got lip and dusted, 
For we knew very well we Inel to go. 
We Came here to get a

And you bet your life we got one mighty soon 
For they found that we could do almost anything, 
So they called us the Irish Cocoons.

In spite of advice she'll go far away, 
Sornetilw's she cannot be found. 
If I

And twist off the both of his legs, ha, ha !

At night she'll pat on her fol-de-lol-lols, 
Then she'll skip off to her picnics and balls, 
Then on the neighbors she'll make her grand calls, 
Borrow all the clothes that she can.

MY MARY ANN. 
Sung by LARRY TOOLEY. 
M Y 
Mary Ann's a 
bruiser, 
I 
often try to lose her, 
She can not and won't be forced to die. 
She can paralyze a 
chicken, 
She is all the time a 
kicking— 
She's one of the girls that's always on the fly. 
Oh, she's gone on beef and mutton, 
She's a 
perfect glutton, 
She strikes terror to a 
Coney Island clam. 
She beat O'Leary walking, 
And Doctor Talmage talking— 
Such a 
constitution has my Mary Ann. 
CIIORI;S. 
She's a 
darling, she's a 
greasy, 
She can kick the stuffing out of any man. 
She licked Tom Collins twice, 
I 
had to put her on ice— 
Such a 
constitution has my Mary Ann. 
My Mary Ann is a 
stunner, 
She is a 
perfect bummer, 
She weighs about two hundred and fifty pounds. 
She's all the time a 
mashing, 
Her clothes is out of fashion, 
Her equal in this city can't be found. 
Oh, you'll always find her lushing, 
Yon NM smell her breath from Flushing. 
And the gang all say she isn't worth a 
hang. 
She used to go with Beecher, 
And she often tried to teach him 
To be a 
little tender on the lamb.

Dinke doodle dum, dinke doodle dum, 
That's the highly interesting song he sung, 
Dinke doodle dum, dinke doodle dum, days. 
Merry warbling birds, joyous happy birds, 
On the grave of— 
The badger and the bear, the rabbit and the hare, 
And the birds in the wildwood lawn, 
The pretty little rabbit, so engaging in his habit, 
They all got a

Listen to the motto that I'll give you, 
You'll find it a 
good one and prove true, 
Make all the friends you can, 
Always lend a

But don't give up the old wife. 
Dey all do it, dey all do it, 
Day all do it, dey all do it, and sometimes dey rue it, 
Yes, dey all do it, dey all do it,

He felt so good that he did say— 
You may look but you mustn't touch, mustn't touch, 
Keep your hands off,

Will you ever tumble, will you ever drop, 
Cheese it, Cully, and hurry your nibs,

I'll bounce you, I'll hit you with a

You couldn't help but— 
Oh, my, ain't he a

Oh my, I

DELIA ON THE TRAPEZE. 
IRISH SONG. 
Written by We. J. SCANLON. 
I 
HAVE a 
charmer, she's my alarmer, 
Oh, what a 
pleasure to have such a 
treasure, 
I 
call her baby, she calls me deary, 
AYR pass all our time in a 
most pleasant way. 
When we're out for a 
walk the young men do say 
As we pass them by in the street, 
"Look at Lynch and his mash, don't they cut a 
dash, 
Don't his darling look charming and sweet ?" 
CHORUS. 
But you should see Delia 
When on the trapeze, 
She'll stand on her head 
And she'll fall on her knees. 
She is a 
daisy, sets them all crazy, 
They laugh and they shout till you'd think they 
would burst. 
(
Repeat.) 
I 
brought my brother, his wife and her mother, 
To the theatre, so they could mate her, 
When she came out you'd think they would ate her, 
They shouted and yelled a 
horrible way. 
When poor Deat heard it she looked with surprise, 
From the trapeze I 
thought she would fall, 
She turned a 
flip-flap, bounced around on her back. 
Ali, my how the people did bawl I 
But you should see Delia, etc.

About twendy-droo penens he had stopped, 
Und asked if dey ecruld help him ; 
How sad he vas when dey shook dere heads, 
Und sait, " Old boy, dot's too thin." 
At last he struck a 
bier saloon, 
He approached it very shy, 
And stood in front as if petrified, 
Humming " the Sweet By mid By. 
But soon he took up couroge, 
Und went in where tile lunch Aras NT‘rer..11 ; 
He made a 
grab at a 
horse raeli.(11, 
Wen a 
beer keg hit his hood ; 
He looked arount 
Und snit, " Boys, dot aint fair ; 
His ears dey fla,shel, his oyes sunburnt, 
Und his head stood on his hair. 
De bartender den went up to him, 
Mit joy his taco did beam-
-Una says, c• -

On dot dere pulling machine ? " 
Do bum walked up to (le pulling machin( , 
For his anger was aroused, 
And hollered loud, '•

De bet was done ; a

Won't there be lots of fun ! 
It will glue his stomach up so tight, 
And kill that son of a

THE WATERMILL. 
A8 Recited by Gus W ILLIAMS. 
LISTEN to the watermill, through the livelong day, 
How the clicking of its wheel wears the hours away, 
Languidly the autumn wind stirs the greenwood leaves ; 
From the fields the reapers sing, binding up the sheaves ; 
And a 
proverb haunts my mind, as a 
spell is east— 
The mill will never grind with the water that is past. 
Autumn winds revive no more leaves that once are shed, 
And the sickle cannot reap corn once gathered ; 
And the rippling stream flows on, tranquil, deep, and still 
Never gliding back again to the watermill. 
Truly speaks the proverb old, with a 
meaning vast— 
The mill will never grind with the water that is past. 
Take the lesson to thyself, loving heart, and true ; 
Golden years are fleeting by ; youth is passing, too ; 
Learn to make the most of life, lose no happy day, 
Time will never bring thee back chances swept away ; 
Leave no tender word unsaid, love, while love shall last— 
The mill will never grind with the water that is past. 
:Work while yet the daylight shines, man of strength and 
will, 
Never does the streamlet glide useless by the mill ; 
Wait not till to-morrow's sun beams upon the way, 
All that thou canst call thine own lies in thy—to-day ; 
Power, intellect, and health may not always last— 
The mill will never grind with the water that is past. 
Oh ! the wasted hours of life that have drifted by ; 
011 ! the good we might have done, lost without a 
sigh ! 
Love that we might once have saved by a 
single word, 
Thoughts conceived, but never penned, perishing, un-
heard. 
Take the proverb to thine heart, take and hold it fast— 
The mill will never grind with the water that is past. 
Oh ! love thy God and fellow-man, thyself consider last ; 
For come it will, when thou must scan dark errors of the 
past • 
And when the fight of life is o'er, and earth recedes from 
And 
li
Heaven
'er; in all is glory shines, ' midst the pure, the 
good, the true— 
Then you'll see more clearly the proverb deep and vast— 
The mill will hover (,!Tiria ‘wlth the water that i3 past

The Lost Goat. 
Words and Music by TIM ROGERS, and sung by him with great success 
at the Novelty Theatre, Brooklyn, N. Y. 
I 
am a 
much abused man and terrible broke up, 
Now listen to me and my trouble I'll tell , 
I 
had a 
fine goat, he was fit for a 
queen, 
And was as big as a 
cow and his time was Bill. 
I 
left him last week on the hillsic.".e a 
grazing. 
Eating sweet lilies and timothy hay ; 
And some dirty loafer with talking and coaxing, 
Induced my poor billy goat far, far away. 
CH0111.78. 
Oh, my! have you seen billy, 
My dear little billy goat, cushla machree? 
Some dirty loafer with talking and coaxing,. 
Put salt on his tail and coaxed him away. 
Now, where shall I 
go altar, do tell me that, 
I've been walking all day, I 
am as weak as a 
cat; 
I 
am hungry ad played out, I'll give ye a 
note, 
If any of you tell me where I'll find my goat. 
Gentlemen, tell me, oh, do for my sake, 
If I 
don't find my dear goat my heart it will break; 
I 
would rather lose my wife and my mother-in-law, 
Than to lose my sweet billy goat, cushla magra. 
Oh, my I

There lie sits in the Park on the bench grim and tall, 
The old time bummer that naught can appall ; 
lHlis mind now-wanders to a 
drinking saloon, 
Oh, how quickly could this fellow put a 
ham bone in ruin 
Oh, how well he remembers in days long gone by,

How we used to get fat on the fine, refreshing smell 
That arose from the hash-shop we all loved so well.

Twenty years has he slept on the dock, dock, dock, 
And the sight of a

shock, 
See the coat that he wears has no tails at all, 
It's a 
dizzy old ulster, and three feet too small. 
The beer kegs have gone and the new ern s

Oh, what joy it would g:ve him could he sleep with one; 
But he hopes soon to meat " In the Sweet Pie and Pie," 
When he thinks of a

long sigh. 
Once moce he toddles ofl to work his lunch route, 
He prays that the bartender will not fire him out ; 
He's lost all he had, but he still retains his gaul,

All LING'S TRUE _LOVE. 
Written by R. J. PIGOT. 
Ant.—" Lover's Telegraph.° 
IN 
Baxter street there lived a 
man, 
A 
Chinaman, I 
mean, 
Who was dead in lost with a 
black and tan, 
A 
coon named Susie Green; 
This Chinaman, by name Ah Ling, 
Would fight all day for Suse, 
He went to see her every night, 
To drive away the blues. 
One night Ali Ling went to her house, 
To ask her if she'd go 
With him unto the Chinese hall, 
But Susan answered no ; 
Says Ling " What is the reason, Sue, 
That you won't go with me ?' 
" 
My husband said if I 
should go 
He'd break my head," sobbed she, 
Poor Ling it almost broke his heart 
To think that he should lose 
The lovely one whom he adored— 
His own beloved Suse; 
Says he to her, " 
inn away 
And doss the sea so blue." 
They sailed away—the ship got, lost, 
And that, was the last of the two.

ONE summer's night ten years ago, 
The gang and brother Jim, 
Brought me down to the dock, you know, 
To learn me how to swim. 
They tied a 
rope around my waist, 
And then they heaved me in. 
To tell the truth, I 
was nearly drowned, 
The night I 
learned to swim. 
Swim out, says Pete, arrah, kick your feet, 
Go over- hand, says brother Jim ; 
The gang did shout as they dragged me out, 
The night I 
learned to swim. 
Oh ! " chum roast- beef, the beef is tough," 
The gang sang out to me; 
• 
They danbea my face with lumps of tar, 
I 
looked like a 
Chinee. 
I 
made back dives and somersaults, 
Along with. Shorty Tim ; 
Both my feet were cut with copper nails, 
The night I 
learned to swim. 
Swim out, etc. 
I 
was, chock full of salt water, 
Brought to a 
liquor store, 
There they rolled me on a 
barrel, 
. 
For two long hours or more. 
Sure they mule me drink some brandy, 
I 
had the jim-jam-jams. 
I'll ne'er forget, as long as I 
live, 
The night I 
learned to swim. 
Swim out, etc. 
SKATING ON THE POND.

OF 
all the winter's pleasures. 
The time to pass away,

Of which I

I Guess It's All Right, Mary Ann. 
To my Friend, Charles Morgan. C. R. 
DOCRSTADER. 
You left in the fall, you said duty called, 
And you went far across the blue sea ; 
Be good and be true is what I 
promised you, 
And you said the same thing to me. 
But now we're like strangers as if we'd ne'er met, 
Like you 1'1 forget if I 
can : 
You are far from me now and you've broken your vow, 
But I 
guess it's all right, Mary Ann. 
The eve that we parted you seemed broken hearted. 
You told me you'd come back again ; 
I 
trusted in you for I 
thought you were true, 
Though my own heart was aching with pain. 
When ill among strangers a 
message you sent. 
You told me you wanted a 
man ; 
Not one whom misfortune had claimed as a 
prize, 
But I 
guess its all right Mary Ann. 
As I 
wander alone without even a 
home, 
My memory on bright days of yore; 
I 
see a 
face sad that I 
often made glad, 
When I 
took the first kiss at the door. 
The little old shanty in an alley obscure, 
Forget it I 
can't if you can ; 
I 
would not then believed if told you'd deceive, 
But I 
guess its all right, Mary Ann.

Words and Music by SAM DEVERE. 
In Boston City lives a 
nice young man, 
Tie was awfully fond of beans 
His salary was small, but his appetite large, 
And he lived beyond his nmans. 
He had beans for breakfast, beans for dinner, 
And cold baked la-a 
as for tea - 
Says he, how I 
wish I 
was a 
great big bean, 
how happy I 
would be. 
He'd stand and gaze for hours and hours, 
In the window of a 
bean-i-
i( e , 
The most dog gondest cur for beans 
That ever you did see. 
His mother said when he was young ; 
He'd never eat cakes or creams, 
But was sure to wake up in the middle of the night, 
Crying mamma, I 
want My bean, 
This bean destroyer is now content, 
He's got a 
bully job; 
Tie's head bean-slinger in a 
dining saloon, 
lie is, so help me Bob. 
Where his rich, sonorous voice is heard, 
Now daily as li 
screams, 
At the top of his voice, with his mouth chock full 
Of beans, beans, beans,

But Mary sticks out to the finis. 
Next Monday night she starts out

Up at Harry Hills. 
They threw me in the ewer, 
They Wiped the floor with me : 
They made me walk a

And they stabbed me in lLe neck 
They niade me s,vallow a

Then I 
cried in the key of G , 
When they rolled me in *, pot of beans, 
And made me drink a

Which gave me the fever and chills ;

MIXED CANDIES.

CARTER. 
Sung by PIT ROONEY. 
Copyrighted, 1879, by (I.,INTON T. 
DE W ITT 
THERE'S a 
letter in the candle, 
And it points to baby mine; 
Nancy Lee has broke the crystal 
To the watch upon the Rhine ; 
Kitty Clyde has pinched her feet, 
To keep herself up in the style ; 
And Ben Bolt has stole the waterfall 
Of gentle Annie Lisle. 
I 
am sitting on the stile to-day, 
A 
hundred in the shade, 
With old Muldoon the solid man, 
Of Patrick's day parade. 
He tried one day to stop a 
ball, 
With Spaulding at the bat, 
But a 
fielder caught him on the nose, 
And busted Muldoon's hat. 
Put my little shoes away, 
When the swallows homeward fly ; 
The man up in the moon will laugh, 
To see the well run dry. 
Oh Mollie dear, will you be true, 
When I 
am far at sea ? 
And don't be flirting in the park 
With the fellow that looks like me. 
Charley Ross has been discovered, 
Where the leaves begin to fall; 
Dennis Kearney lost his hatchet, 
But he done it for a 
stall. 
He left his dray in Frisco, 
For to elevate his means, 
And Yankee Doodle filled him up, 
With Boston pork and beans. 
Grandpa's clock has just been buried, 
You will miss it now it's gone, 
For they'll never resurrect it, 
Till old Gabriel blows his horn. 
The devil's dream of little Maud, 
The organ-grinders test, 
The silver threads among the gold, 
Will have to take a 
rest.
