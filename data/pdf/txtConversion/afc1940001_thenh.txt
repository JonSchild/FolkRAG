Then Hurrah for Home!Air-;"A Few Days."I'm going home to stop awhile;Farewell! Farewell!Before I
go we'll take a smileThen hurrah for home!These banking thieves I will not trustFarewell! Farewell!
But with me take my little dustThen hurrah for home.Oh, won't I have some high old times,Farewell!
Farewell!Telling yarns about the mines?Then hurrah for home!I'll leave this world of rags and
dirt,Farewell! Farewell!And wear a plug and ruffle shirt!Then hurrah for home!I'll put on airs like
[Harry?] Meiggs,Farewell! Farewell!Live on oysters, ham and eggs,Then hurrah for home!I'll sink
enough to pay my fare,Farewell! Farewell!Return when tired of staying there.Then hurrah for home!
Chorus:Although I like the diggings,Farewell! Farewell!Although I like the diggings,I'm going to leave!
For I can't always be with you,Farewell! Farewell!For I can't always be with you,Then hurrah for home!
Then Hurrah for Home
