[0:00] AG: Hi! I want to thank you again for participating in these Library of Congress oral histories. 
Can I ask you to introduce yourself, please? 
  
MG: My name is Marqurell Gentry. 
  
AG: Marqurell, can we begin a little bit with your early life and your experiences growing up? Where 
were you raised? 
  
MG: I was raised in East St. Louis, Illinois. It's right across the bridge from St. Louis, Missouri. 
  
AG: Did your parents work? What kind of jobs and things did they do as you were growing up? 
  
MG: My father was an over-the-road truck driver and my mother, she did janitor work, cleaning, things 
like that. 
  
AG: Growing up, do you remember having any particular interests in school, like any subjects that were 
your favorite? 
  
MG: I always loved science, and I've always had a natural desire to help people. Just helping people 
clean, people in our neighborhood, just doing things that I can do to help. 
  
AG: Were there extracurricular activities or social things that you did growing up as well that you 
remember? 
  
MG: Yes, I was into sports. I ran track and played volleyball. Just had an interest in science a lot, so I 
spent a lot of time at the library. 
  
AG: Nice. Do you remember when you decided to pursue nursing as a career? 
  
MG: Nursing just fell into my lap, but so perfect. I was working at a factory in Illinois. I had served 10 
years in the Navy and I had an injury, and during that injury, I never thought I would go back to school 
after the military. During my recovery time, I decided to go to the local junior college and enroll. One of 
the counselors there talked to me about nursing, and I thought it was a great idea. 
  
AG: Can I back up a second and ask you about your experiences in the Navy? Did you enter the Navy 
directly from high school? 
  
MG: I actually was out of high school for a year. Didn't really know what I wanted to do. I was a young 
mother. So, I decided to join the Navy after a year. 
  
AG: What was that like? Did you do basic training and everything, how it works? 
 
Library of Congress Archie Green Folklife Fellowship 2020012, Nursing America's Veterans  
5 
 
  
MG: I did basic training in Chicago, and that was in 1995, and then I was stationed in Northern 
California, in Lemoore, California. I was a aviation electrician. I started out undesignated as a plane 
captain, so I worked on a flight deck doing different things, and eventually became an aviation 
electrician working on a EP, on F-18s, A, B's and C's, and then eventually began working on the E's and 
F's. I've been on different ships, the Lincoln, the Stennis. Those are the two main ships that I worked on. 
  
AG: When you're in the Navy, do you sleep on the ships? Is it like you're living on the ships that you're 
working on, or are you also commuting to the mainland? 
  
MG: We did operations 24 hours a day. As you can imagine, during training, the flights go on 
throughout the day, so we would take time to sleep. We worked 12 to 18 hours every day. It's very busy. 
We do sleep right over the flight deck. When they land you can hear it boom, so I guess you can call it 
sleeping [laughs]. 
  
AG: Right. It sounds like you might be resting or lying down but you're probably not sleeping sleeping 
[laughs]. 
  
MG: Yes, very stressful environment. But yes, we lived on a ship and the ship had so many people. It 
was like a small town actually. After a while you forget you're on a ship. But yeah, we lived on a ship 
predominantly for six months at a time. 
  
AG: How long were you in the Navy? How long did you do that? 
  
MG: I joined the Navy in 1995 and I served 10 years. 
  
AG: What was it like balancing your role as a mother with your role as a service person? How did that 
work? 
  
MG: It was difficult. I had a lot of support from my mom and my dad and of course my brothers and 
sisters. They helped a lot. It worked out, but I decided to get out and I eventually joined the Army. Being 
on a sea duty, as you can imagine-- You can have shore duty or sea duty, and when you're on sea duty, 
you're away a lot. The Army gave me the ability to be home more. 
  
AG: So, you switched from the Navy into the Army? 
  
MG: Yeah. 
  
AG: Was that after the 10 years, or that's all kind of in that 10-year period? 
  
MG: It was actually after the 10 years, after I obtained my nursing degree. 
  
AG: I see, I see. So, in the middle, you went back to college and got your nursing degree. So, that kind 
of fell into your lap, you were saying. Having left the Navy, you were working and someone sort of 
suggested nursing? 
 
Library of Congress Archie Green Folklife Fellowship 2020012, Nursing America's Veterans

MG: Yes. 
  
AG: Got it. Do you remember what your kind of first experiences as a nurse were? 
  
[5:49] MG: Wow, so exciting. When I graduated, I graduated in a town called Centralia, Illinois, and I 
began working at St. Mary's Hospital. I began my career actually in critical care in the ICU, of course, 
which a lot of people are hesitant to do, but I was able to go through the interview process and begin my 
training in critical care in the ICU. 
  
AG: That must have been a really intense first job being in the critical care unit right out of school, I 
imagine. 
  
MG: Yeah, it was, but it was a great foundation. The nurses that I worked with had been in that 
department for decades, literally. It's a small town, so they were really close, a close-knit unit. They 
were rough but they-- the training that I went through really prepared me for my career. 
  
AG: Do you remember any particularly difficult first experiences in that role, or maybe, on the other 
hand, really positive experiences that you were like, "Oh wow. This is what I want to do," in that first 
kind of couple years? 
  
MG: Yeah. I think that I want to start with the positive, of course. The positive experiences was just as 
an individual, being able to derive life experiences into being a nurse, because nursing is so personable, 
and you are really in a career, but you're really an individual in that career. So, I discovered my own 
tactic of dealing with families, 'cause of course in the ICU, you're dealing a lot with families. Most of 
the time, your patient is in a unconscious state, so you're caring for them from head to toe. So, you have 
that emotional, that spiritual, and that physical. Then, you're also dealing with the providers and your 
team, your nurse, being able to delegate, being able to know how to approach the family and 
understanding their sensitivities and listening. Those were the positives. The negatives, I really can't say. 
I think that the negatives is just learning and understanding and maneuvering, and making sure you're 
keeping the patients safe. Being able to understand what to listen for, what to do, the different actions 
and how to delegate your work. What's first? What's the most important? What's the second most 
important? You depend on your team a lot. You have to be a team player. I guess that's negative, but not 
really. I think that's just something important to learn in nursing. But it does take you out of the natural, I 
guess, course of life. Nursing is definitely a unique career. 
  
AG: Right, absolutely. It's quite a specific niche that people-- you have to be very well suited for it, it 
seems. How long did you stay in that role, and then what was the process of returning and joining the 
Army at this [unintelligible]? 
  
MG: I was in Centralia up until 2011. My nursing career began in 2008. And then 2011, I left Centralia 
to join the Army. I went into basic training again. It was the reserves portion of the military, so I began 
working in the ER, but then I moved to Missouri. I still work with St. Mary's, the same hospital, but just 
in a different area. I began working in the ER in Lake St. Louis, Missouri, which is a different form of 
critical care.

AG: Yes, another very high stakes environment. What was the typical shift like when you worked in the 
ER? Did you work 24 hours a day, kind of, you didn't know what your shift would be like, or did you 
have a set schedule? Was it more routine? 
  
MG: It was very routine. I worked 12-hour shifts whenever, of course, whenever I worked ICU and ER. 
Yeah, 12-hour shifts, seven to seven. I worked the evenings when I was in Missouri, so we worked 12-
hour shifts in the ER. We had a pediatric section and then we had the ER for adults as well. 
  
AG: When you say seven to seven, you went in at 7pm and worked 'til the morning? 
  
MG: Yes. 
  
AG: I see. Were there kind of similar or frequent cases or issues that you saw in the ER, or was it just 
the whole gamut that you could encounter any sort of diagnosis or injury? 
  
[11:01] MG: Generally, it was way different. In the ICU, I experienced the after effects. I'm taking care 
of the patient that came in with shortness of breath. I could read their chart, of course, what you need to 
know, the history of what happened. You can read their chart and see, "Oh, this patient showed up at the 
ER in respiratory distress, and this happened, this happened, this happened, and they end up having a 
collapsed lung." Now, in the ICU, I'm taking care of their chest tube versus the ER. Them coming in, I'm 
there, I'm keeping them calm, I'm talking to the family. I'm getting them stable and then I'm just, of 
course, taking care of the emergent issues, and then getting them off to surgery and stabilizing them. 
  
AG: Got it. You're doing the kind of issue stabilizing and then they get passed off. 
  
MG: Right. 
  
AG: How long did you work as an ER nurse? 
  
MG: Man, I worked as an ER nurse all the way up until 2015. No, no, I'm sorry. I worked as a ER nurse 
all the way up to-- When did I start in telephone care? Bear with me. I'm sorry. 2019. So, from 2011 'til 
2019. 
  
AG: Oh wow. Quite a long time that you worked. What brought you to the VA? How did that transition 
happen? 
  
MG: My husband is in the Army; he was active duty. After I left Missouri, we were stationed in 
California. In California, I worked in different ER's around Southern California. I worked there, 
different hospitals every day, never know what to expect, which was very nerve-wracking. We decided 
to move to Tennessee and he retired, and I began working at the VA in the ER here at the Murfreesboro 
campus. I eventually left the ER because I wanted to pursue my psychiatric nurse practitioner degree, 
which I have one more clinical remaining. I'll graduate in February.

AG: Wow. So, you're right now working full-time for the VA and pursuing your psychiatric nurse 
practitioner-- clinical nurse practitioner. Wow, that must be a lot to balance. 
  
MG: Yeah, it is. 
  
AG: So, what is your current role? You're not in the ER at the VA right now, is that right? What are you 
doing currently? 
  
MG: Currently, I do work in an urgent care unit. I'm a telephone care nurse. We are the first line, which 
we answer all the calls for all the clinics. We take care of patients with symptoms, emergencies, 
psychiatric emergencies, medical emergencies, as well as just putting notes in for patients. If somebody 
wants-- somebody may call in and be like, "My wheelchair broke," so I'm giving them a solution for 
that. I'll put a note in to the doctor. Things of that sort. If somebody calls in, "I just had surgery 
yesterday," or "I just had surgery this morning and I'm bleeding," I would have to kind of guide them on 
what to do. 
  
AG: So, your point of contact is with the patients. They call you first and you'd kind of talk through 
whatever issue they've got going. Do you provide medical advice on the phone to them? 
  
MG: Absolutely. That's exactly what we do. 
  
AG: What are some of the cases that you've seen?  
  
[14:56] MG: Oh my god. On a mental portion, we will get a call and a person is on the phone suicidal or 
homicidal. I've even had cases where you can hear that that person is delusional, or they're seeing 
shadows in their home. In those cases, you have to be able to-- 'Cause we do have a system that we use. 
We call it a TEDP, which is an assessment. It's a tool that we do have that's made by doctors and nurses, 
and we can go through-- For example, if you're having visual hallucinations or suicidal or depressed, we 
could put that word in and it'll go through a series of questions. But, of course, guiding that individual, 
because in those cases, those are emergencies. Of course, you can imagine someone who's not mentally 
stable at that time, they may want to talk about something different. You have to be able to have those 
communication skills where you are able to guide them back to, "Hey, let's get this done." I think that 
those skills come from your previous nursing experiences. All the nurses that I work with currently have 
a background that is amazing. They all work critical care, ER, in different areas of nursing. 
  
AG: It sounds like to be sort of successful in the telephone nursing, you really have to have some 
extensive bedside experience, either in a critical care or maybe a med surg or a hands-on floor. 
 
MG: Absolutely. 
  
AG: That makes sense, certainly. When you were talking to someone, for example, who is suicidal or 
maybe homicidal or maybe having hallucinations, in that case, do you end up referring them to-- do you 
suggest that they come into an ER, or do you ever deploy doctors or the police or something to their 
homes, or is it primarily phone therapy at that point? 
 
 
Library of Congress Archie Green Folklife Fellowship 2020012, Nursing America's Veterans

MG: As nurses, the first thing that I would do is keep the patient on the phone. Then I want to make sure 
I'm verifying their address and their telephone number, so that we know, "Hey, are you alone? Are you 
with someone? Do you have a weapon with you?" I'm making sure that foundation is there. The second 
thing I'm going to do is I'm going to get a social worker on the phone. There's always a social worker in 
the ER. That team is-- that we work, of course, delegate with them. Then we have a police department as 
well, so if the case comes where I feel like I need to dispatch to police officers on campus, they will get 
in contact with that county and have us-- we'll check. But predominantly, we'll get them to the social 
worker. They're great and they deal with these situations all the time in the ER. That's what we do - a 
warm handoff, keep the patient on the phone and then transfer them to them. 
  
AG: Right, I see. Is it similar if someone called and describes symptoms that you recognized were 
something like a heart attack or a stroke? Would you then similarly dispatch an ambulance or tell them 
to get to the campus? How do you handle those acute situations?  
 
MG: Yeah, those are so emotional. If I have a patient that’s calling in-- As you can imagine, veterans are 
just a different population. You're predominantly dealing with a male, and older males in most cases. 
Sometimes they're so tough, or I shouldn't use that word tough, but they've been through so much. 
Sometimes it's difficult to get them to understand the extent. "I'm short of breath," or, "I'm having chest 
pressure. I've been having this for a week," and then you're talking to them on the phone. It depends on 
the case, but sometimes you'll run into someone that's just stubborn: "No, I'm fine. I think it's just gas." 
But you have to say, "Hey, listen.” You've built up a rapport with this person throughout the telephone 
conversation. You have to quickly establish that trust, that rapport with them, and say, "Hey. I 
understand that you've had this before but--" Some cases, I'll say, "We have one life and we have to take 
care of ourselves, so go get it checked out. What will it hurt? Go get it checked out, and if it's nothing, 
it's nothing, but if it's something, boy, I bet you'd be happy that you went and got this checked out." So, 
really having that ability to communicate with them, and getting them on the same page where, "Hey, 
this is serious." Of course, if they have a family member there, mainly a wife, we can always speak with 
the wife and say, "Hey. I just talked to him. I assessed him and this is what we came up with. I've 
advised him to go to the ER now. I don't want him to drive himself, so I'm advising you to call 9-1-1, 
because if you call 9-1-1, the ambulance will come and they will be able to start treatment now." That's 
what I suggest that he do. 
  
AG: How long does a typical phone treatment last? Could it be minutes or even an hour, or is it very 
different? 
  
[20:37] MG: We're a call center, so, typically, we're instructed three minutes phone time, but of course, 
it can take longer, and so, it's a case-by-case basis. Something like that, I want to be quick. I don't want 
to be on the phone with this person for eight, nine minutes. I want to talk to them. I'm listening to their 
voice. I'm listening for signs of distress, and I'm going to assess them quickly. In some cases, if I'm 
looking at their history, because we can pull up their chart, and they're telling me they're having any 
symptoms, sometimes I'll say, "Go to the ER now. Call 9-1-1. I want you to hang up," and I may call 
them back in a few minutes to make sure that that happened. You don't want to be on the phone with 
them long. In most cases, you can go back into their chart, because we do follow-up calls, and you can 
see, this patient went to Erlanger and they had open heart or they were having a heart attack. You don't 
want to be on the phone with them too long, three minutes. 
 
Library of Congress Archie Green Folklife Fellowship 2020012, Nursing America's Veterans  
10 
 
  
AG: Three minutes is the optimum to get them where they need to be. Once people call you, do you 
have a protocol in place where you call them back and check up on them a week or two weeks later, 
something like that? 
  
MG: Patients who I assess and I've advised them to be seen within two to eight hours or now, “Go to the 
ER now”, 9-1-1, those patients I'm going to follow up the very next day. I have a program that I can go 
into, and what I would do is I would look and see, did this person go? Did the PAC team follow up? The 
Patient-Aligned Care team, I attach their names to the chart, so they also have access. They know, "Hey, 
this patient called telephone care and I put a note in for them." I'll state it as such: "Veteran called. 
Complained of chest pain,” and then I will say, "Advised to go to the ER now." Then I'll text a doctor, 
I'll text a nurse, and anyone else that-- if there's a specialty team, I'll attach them to the note as well so 
they have to sign off on that note. It's an alert that we send over. I have access to that to be able to say, at 
this time, we're all a team working together to make sure this patient is taken care of and followed up on. 
I'll look and I'll say "Hey, did the doctor call back or did the nurse call back? What happened?" If I don't 
see anything, I'll call them at the number listed and I will follow up with them: "Hey, how are you 
feeling today? Did you go in to be seen?" If they did, I put all that pertinent information in, because we 
want to give records and we want to have that in a chart. "Veteran went to the ER. This happened. This 
was the diagnosis. These are the medications they were given," because of course, we want to know 
what medications they were given, because the VA we do have a protocol to follow up for patients, two 
to eight hours, ER now, 9-1-1, however, we also want to make sure that patient is safe, and we want to 
know any other medications that they've taken, any other treatments because that helps in future care. 
  
AG: Right, absolutely. It sounds like the computer system is really well integrated. Like you said, you 
can tag the doctor and the nurse and make sure they are all getting real time updates about what's 
happening in your treatment sessions. 
  
MG: Yes, the VA has a great system. As you can imagine, because of my nursing career, moving around 
a lot, I've done GoLive's in New York and different places like that. The VA has a great system. We 
have CPRS, which we can access the patient's chart. We have TRM. That is the program that we use to 
put notes in, so it captures any activity, any notes that I may submit for the patient. We also have a chat 
system, so we can go on and, for example, I'm a nurse in telephone care. You're a nurse on that patient's 
care team, so you're with the primary care provider and you're the RN. Usually, we'd like to 
communicate with the RN. If I get a patient that calls and says, "Hey, I'm out of my medication. A 
doctor told me to take two pills a day when I was originally taking one pill a day, and now I'm out," this 
may be his blood pressure medication. I can immediately message that patient or the nurse for that 
patient and get that medication and say, "Hey, I'm putting a note in. He's out of his amiodarone and he 
wants to know if this can be ordered now." Most of the time, they're able to get that taken care of. It's a 
great communication system for us to work with to take care of veterans. 
  
AG: Yeah, that sounds state of the art. Amazing. In this current role, what is your schedule like typically 
every week? Is it nine to five, or is it very variable? 
  
MG: My schedule is from 7am to 3:30pm, which is a great schedule. 
  
 
Library of Congress Archie Green Folklife Fellowship 2020012, Nursing America's Veterans  
11 
 
AG: Do you go into a location, part of the campus, or do you do it remotely? How does that work? 
  
MG: We do it on campus. We're in a building; we have cubicles. We have a computer system there and 
we log in. We go in. 
  
AG: The telephone nurses are all kind of in the same place in their cubicles? Did that change during 
COVID? Did they have you all working remotely at any point, or because you're not in patient contact, 
was it still happening in person? 
  
[26:39] MG: It was still on campus. We still came in. We had to wear a mask all the time during our 
shift, and we do take all the proper precautions, because of course, throughout the day, you have the 
cleaning crew coming through, you have different people coming through to take care of technical 
issues. You have IT, you have the different entities coming in. We are in a locked unit, and then of 
course, we share the same kitchen, we share the same restroom. It's been concerning for the nurses, but  
we maintain-- 'cause, of course, we have no control over whether we go home or not. We definitely 
could go home 'cause, of course, everybody has internet now, but no, we were not allowed to go home. 
We were told to mask up, and then of course, we were given a protocol for COVID symptoms or 
patients who were COVID-positive. 
  
AG: During the sort of height of the pandemic, did you field a lot of calls from people who, as you 
assess them, you determine they might be experiencing COVID? 
  
MG: Absolutely. We got a lot of calls in the beginning. When this pandemic began, we received a lot of 
calls, and veterans that would call in, you can hear in their voice if they did have symptoms, because 
ironically, it was during the time that flu season was going on as well. A lot of people just-- the fear of 
the unknown, and then social media and of course, the news, and they watched that. It was very difficult. 
We had a lot of calls, either patients inquiring about what to do, as well as patients calling in with 
symptoms. Still, you still have those patients with the mental emergencies, urgencies, and also the 
physical urgencies and emergencies. It impacted the VA overall, but it affected those patients, and it 
affected our job and how we handled those, because we'd have to know: Am I sending this patient to the 
ER? Am I sending this patient to urgent care? We were instructed to, in some cases, contact the PAC 
team. For example, if that patient was told, "You need to be seen within 12 to 24 hours," and usually we 
would say, "If you're not able to make an appointment with your doctor within that time frame, then you 
need to go to the urgent care." We have the missions at urgent care where the VA will pay for the 
veterans to be seen up to three times a year, but we couldn't do that anymore. We actually had to say, 
"Hey, I'm going to contact your PAC team, your primary care provider and your nurse, and let them 
know you're having this issue," and they will be assigned or tasked to call the patient to follow up with 
them in those cases. With patients that were told to go to the ER now, we were actually contacting the 
ER and giving them a synopsis of what was going on, speaking directly to the doctors or the nurse 
practitioners in that ER to let them know, "Hey, this patient broke his leg but, at the same time, he's 
screening positive for COVID." In those cases, what do you do? You obviously have to treat that 
patient, but we wanted to give them a heads up, this patient was coming in, so that they can streamline 
them and keep them away from other individuals, because we didn't want them to expose other 
individuals to COVID, and then keep the doctors and nurses safe as well.

AG: Right, that makes sense. Did you see an increased volume in calls over the past year? Do you feel 
like it was noticeable? 
  
[30:37] MG: Absolutely. Yes, we received an influx of calls simply because not only are you having 
patients that call with symptoms and wanting to contact their doctors, but they were also calling to get 
advice, because we are a nursing advice line. We have patients call in about, "When is the injection 
coming out? Is the VA going to start giving it? Which one are they giving? What are the side effects?" 
Then those patients were also calling because they got the injection and they're having these side effects. 
We had those patients plus patients with COVID symptoms plus the other patients that were 
symptomatic. So, yes. 
  
AG: So, it was just one thing on top of another. 
  
MG: Absolutely. 
  
AG: Wow. In your expertise, in your perspective, how do you think COVID affected the VA overall? 
  
MG: Wow, that's a good question. I think that COVID affected the VA's processes. I think that in a lot 
of ways, it was eye opening. The VA was very organized and getting the immunizations on board, 
aligning a team. For example, when you come on campus, you're not just driving through and parking 
and going to your appointment. Now you have to go through a block, a roadblock. Individuals are 
assigned there. The police officers are doing more rounds on campus. But we have to streamline 
individuals, control traffic in a sense, because we don't want too many individuals coming on campus in 
the building. I think that it changed the structure of the VA. In the beginning when COVID first began, 
we had a testing site, a tent, on campus that was outside. There was a van parked and individuals will be 
streamlined. When you come onto campus, "What are you here for?" and then they would do a 
screening: "Are you having COVID symptoms? Have you been around someone with COVID? Is 
anyone in your household have COVID?" Then they would streamline them to another area where they 
would swab the patient, or they would give them an armband saying, "Hey, this patient has been 
screened. They're okay to go on the campus." They would check to see if they had an appointment. You 
would not be able to take other individuals in with you, which is very difficult for a lot of people, 
because wives and husbands are typically going together to their appointments 'cause they're each other's 
helpmate. A lot of times, veterans had to go in alone. That impacted a lot, because then we would have a 
patient who may have  dementia or just don't remember, and so that would impact their plan of care, 
'cause a doctor may say, "A, B and C," but the patient may only remember “C”. That's another place that 
the nursing telephone care center came into play, because then the doctor would chart, "I told this patient 
to do this, this and that, and I started this medication. I told him to stop this medication," and when the 
wife or the family member calls back frustrated, I can give them some peace of mind. I can say, "Hey. I 
understand. I know it's very difficult right now. Because of COVID, we are trying to keep the flow of 
traffic inside of the hospital down because we don't want to expose our-- you, even. We don't want you 
guys to be exposed as well. But, I have this doctor's note, and I can tell you exactly what the doctor said. 
Let me look at the plan of care." After I verify their information and make sure that they're an individual 
I can speak with or that it's the veteran, I can tell them, "The doctor said stop this medication, start this 
medication. He wants them to have an x-ray and a follow up in a week," and so that was beneficial. 
Also, we started doing telephone visits and video visits more. I think that was beneficial, 'cause as you 
 
Library of Congress Archie Green Folklife Fellowship 2020012, Nursing America's Veterans  
13 
 
know, as I said in the beginning, veterans are a different population, so a lot of veterans live so far away. 
They may live an hour away, or 45 minutes away. So, they were able to, like me and you are talking 
now, talk to the doctor over the phone or do a video call. Those were things that happened and changed 
with the VA. I think that it was a benefit, because for a lot of doctors and patients, it got them more 
acclimated with doing that, so now in the future, hopefully, when this pandemic goes away, this can be 
something that we continue to implement so we can have a better care for the veteran. It's beneficial in a 
lot of ways. 
  
AG: Right, it really introduced the idea of phone or video visits so that they don't have to make such a 
long commute. 
  
MG: Absolutely. 
  
AG: You know, speaking of the particular patient population at the VA, do you think that your 
experiences in the Navy and in the Army Reserves help you at all in terms of building rapport or 
understanding your patients? 
  
[36:17] MG: Absolutely. Veterans, basic training and actually having that camaraderie with other 
veterans is very important. I can, as a veteran working for the VA and having a background as a nurse, I 
can relate to veterans on a different level. I've been outside in a tent. I had to use a porta potty. I had to 
carry my rifle everywhere I went. So, I can relate to them. I can use their lingo. Veterans need that 
camaraderie. After I got out of the Navy, I had a very difficult time adjusting to civilian life, because 
you don't think that when you're in basic training, you're going through those trainings, that you're being 
transformed, your thinking is different. We have the hurry up and wait mentality; we have that 
teamwork mentality. It's very difficult for veterans to adjust to the civilian world because of the way that 
we're trained to be in the military. When I'm talking to a veteran, absolutely, it's easy for me to be able to 
relate to them. I'm not saying that every veteran is relatable, because of course, we have veterans from 
different generations, but for the most part, I spoke to plenty female veterans who began the 
conversation frustrated and hesitant and standoffish, but I'm able to bring and give them information: 
"Hey, this service is available at the VA. This service is available at the VA." Having that camaraderie 
and having that experience in common, absolutely. I always urge other veterans to work at the VA 
because veterans need that. They do. 
  
AG: Right, that understanding and having that shared perspective really benefits them as well as you. 
Are there other aspects, do you think, of your military service that influence how you approach nursing? 
Like kind of you were saying the hurry up and wait mentality? Do you think you're more organized than 
you would be otherwise, or are there other aspects of having served for so many years, more than a 
decade, that influence the way you approach it? 
  
MG: Absolutely. Being a veteran and being a nurse, I'm more-- Not saying that other nurses are not, I 
can only speak for myself, but the way that it has impacted me is I'm very task-oriented. I'm going to get 
the job done. If there is something going on, for example, at the VA, if I have a patient that comes in 
with an issue, I'm focused on that. I'm able to delegate better. I'm able to multitask better. I definitely 
don't think that I would be the nurse I am today without that military background and training. 
  
 
Library of Congress Archie Green Folklife Fellowship 2020012, Nursing America's Veterans  
14 
 
AG: Right, that makes sense. I'm sorry. I have two questions I want to ask you and I'm trying to decide 
the order to put them in. I'll just ask you this one. What was it for you about working for the VA that 
was most appealing when you sort of pursued this job in Tennessee? 
  
MG: I'm gonna get a little emotional. I'm trying not to. I come from, I'm not gonna say a rough 
background, but when I joined the military, it changed me. I would say that it made me the person I am 
today. It's difficult to explain, but when you become a soldier or when you become a sailor or an airman, 
you become a different person. That's your family, so I'm working with my family. When I see a veteran 
going through distress or having, some type of a mental issue, it's more personable for me, because not 
only did this person sacrifice and serve for me, but I was right there with them, so I'm there to give back, 
to say, "Thank you," and I understand what I'm saying "thank you" for, because I've been there [begins 
to cry]. That's the difference. I have wore those boots. I have been on a flight. I've been on a flight deck. 
I've been in the field, so I understand what they're saying. When they're talking to me and they're saying 
that they went through tis or that, I understand where they're coming from 'cause I've been there too. So, 
it becomes more personable.  
  
AG: Yes, you've already in a way, but not everyone-- No, you know, talking to nurses at the VA is so 
emotional. Everybody feels so powerful and so committed, and then, like you said, everyone feels so 
indebted to the veterans.  
  
MG: Yeah. 
  
AG: It really is very powerful. Hearing all these wonderful stories from nurses who have this great 
responsibility, a huge responsibility, has been so moving for me. I feel very lucky. 
  
MG: Yeah. 
  
AG: You know, I'm also wondering, given all of the experience that you've had as a nurse in critical care 
and ER's, what made you decide to pursue psychiatric clinical nurse practitioner? Was there something 
about your earlier experiences that instilled that interest? 
  
[42:30] MG: Yeah. I think as adults, we look back and reflect on our life. Absolutely there was things 
that happened in my upbringing that brought me to this decision in my career, but I know how the 
military impacts and I understand how it impacts and those experiences. When I got out, as I mentioned 
to you before, after I got out the Navy, I was homeless for a couple of years with my children, so, I went 
through that mental state. Even though I may have had family that might have wanted to help me, I was 
in a different mental state. It was very difficult for me to separate. I think when we look at veterans who 
are going through mental issues, who are impacted-- People want to look at veterans that may have the 
physical injuries, but so many have the mental injuries, and I was one of those veterans, so, I can relate 
on a deeper level. Everybody has different experiences, but I was there, I guess I can say. That made me 
want to say, "I want to help veterans who are going through mental difficulties, the psychiatric 
difficulties," because I really do feel that that's an important aspect of nursing that needs to be built. I 
feel like-- that I've had my military experience and my personal experience coming up that I can help 
veterans in that way, and that's what I want to do. 
  
 
Library of Congress Archie Green Folklife Fellowship 2020012, Nursing America's Veterans  
15 
 
AG: Yes, absolutely. It sounds like this population, maybe more than the general population, has a need 
for mental health care. 
  
MG: And also-- I'm sorry. I didn't mean to cut you off. I also think that as time went on, that we're 
discovering how much people or individuals are impacted. I think that as long as you're going through it, 
you're going through the motions, you're in the military, you have your team, your family so to say, but 
then when you leave, it's like I don't have that importance. I don't have that, I don't have that team. It's 
separating from that, and then you're going right back to your life. A lot of times things happen in the 
military as well. I think that we're realizing the impact that the military has on individuals mentally, and 
getting them to adjust to separating, I think that is a most important thing that the military needs to work 
on. VA plays a great part of that, getting them stable. 
  
AG: Absolutely. That transition must be so life-altering. 
  
MG: Absolutely. 
  
AG: You really need to have the support, physical, mental, emotional support, for that transition. Do you 
have a sense of when you complete your clinical nurse practitioner degree, what kind of role you'd like? 
  
MG: The VA's so wonderful. I always wanted to work at the VA when I finished my nursing degree. I 
said, "I'm working for--." I didn't say, "I want." I said, "I'm working for the VA." It didn't matter how 
long it would take. That was a whole reason of me getting my degree from the beginning. The VA is 
paying for my master's degree. I'm in a program, a scholarship program. I'm gonna forget the name of it. 
I always forget the name of it. NNIE scholarship. I did apply for that. I qualified for it. The VA's paying 
for that master's degree, and then I will commit three years to them after I'm finished. They're actually 
paying for this. I'm not going anywhere, so it was a win-win for me [chuckles]. 
  
AG: Right, it's perfect, because it's not like you're hoping to go somewhere else. This is the place for 
you. 
  
MG: Yeah. 
  
AG: As a clinical nurse practitioner, you can provide therapy and prescribe medication, that kind of 
thing? That will be some of what your scope entails, or is it different than [unintelligible]? 
  
[47:11] MG: Every behavioral health team, they have a psychiatrist and a nurse practitioner, most of 
them, and then they have a social worker, and then they have a nurse, a RN, as well as a MSA and an 
LPN. So, that's a team. Great team. Great, I love it. But the nurse practitioner, what I will do, I can 
provide psychotherapy and also medication management. So, I will be prescribing. I will be typically 
aligned with the psychiatrists, so I'm pretty much doing what the psychiatrist does, but some 
medications I cannot prescribe without that doctor's approval. Of course, I'm always reaching out and 
getting advice from a provider if I'm not sure, but they're there to support me and I'm there to support 
them as well. That make any sense? 
  
 
Library of Congress Archie Green Folklife Fellowship 2020012, Nursing America's Veterans  
16 
 
AG: Yes, absolutely. It does. Like you said, it's so beneficial to have that kind of huge team of experts 
from different perspectives working together. That's another really cool part of the VA, it sounds like, 
approach, working in teams like that. You said you have one more clinical rotation before you're a 
clinical nurse practitioner? 
  
MG: Yes, I have one clinical remaining, my pediatric mental health rotation, and then after I'm complete 
with that, I will be able to test for the psychiatric mental health nurse practitioner exam and then I'll be 
licensed as a psychiatric nurse practitioner. 
  
AG: Clinical rotations. That's usually in a facility, like a hospital or psychiatric facility, right? It's hands 
on? 
  
MG: Right. We have to complete a total of four, and I completed my first three at the VA. Yes, you're 
there with the provider and learning there. However, the pediatric, due to COVID, it will be virtual, so I 
will be able to be at those appointments and watch and listen and see what happened. Of course, I 
understand why, of course because of COVID. 
  
AG: Right, exactly. When you're thinking about your career at the VA so far and also into the future, 
what are some of the most rewarding aspects of working at the VA, do you think? 
  
[50:11] MG: There's a lot of rewarding aspects of the VA. Of course, the individuals at the VA, you're 
working with nurses who have been doing what they're doing for years, decades. My nurse manager 
right now, her name is Angela Sweat, she's been with the VA for more than 20 years. I want to say in the 
30s, but I'm pretty sure it's right about there in between those two numbers, which is amazing. These are 
people who have a passion for veterans. Because I've worked in the civilian side and I've worked with 
the VA as well, I see the difference. It's not just like another person coming through the door. These are 
veterans, and they do stress that, so I think that seeing that passion to care for soldiers that represented 
our country, I think that they have-- something is different about them. They have that compassion. 
They care on a different level. It's the purpose behind it. 
  
AG: What do you think are some of the more challenging aspects of working at the VA? 
  
MG: The challenges are working with veterans. I will say that that is challenging in some ways, because 
you want to be sensitive to them and their needs. You want to make sure that they are getting the right 
information, and you want to know the right information to give. As you know, the VA, they have a 
different way of doing things. They're not like the civilian side, so you have to understand what's 
available for the veteran and different programs that are available to them. Just knowing who does what, 
what do you do in this situation or that situation, because at the end of the day, you don't want to be that 
person that gives a veteran the wrong information 'cause it's frustrating and it's not giving good service. 
We want to provide a good service to them. Being able to maneuver the VA system and understanding 
what to do, where to send this patient. 
  
AG: Are there any services that you would like to see either improved or provided for veterans through 
the VA? 
  
 
Library of Congress Archie Green Folklife Fellowship 2020012, Nursing America's Veterans  
17 
 
MG: I think that we hit on that. I think that we need to get, and I think they are already working on a 
team, predominantly a program for veterans who are separating from the military. Every veteran that's 
separated from military don't come to the VA, and I don't think that should be the case. I think that there 
should be a program for veterans who are transitioning out, because I think that we can avoid a lot of the 
issues that they have to deal with later. I think that if we grabbed them in the beginning, and we at least 
offer them a transition from the military to the VA, I think that we'll see a big change and a decrease in 
the mental health cases and emergencies that we see. We have such a high suicide rate for veterans and 
we can avoid that. The VA is about saving lives, and I think that is very important, transitioning out. 
When I got out the Navy, I was given my DD 214. Now if you serve and retire, you're offered a 
transition, but I was not offered that, and that hurt me, because it took me a while to get to that point, but 
I had to go the long way around. With the military and the VA working together and streamlining the 
mental health program, I think that we will give that veteran a bridge so that they don't have to go the 
long way around. They can just cross over. 
  
AG: Right. It sounds like there isn't really right now even that much collaboration between the military 
and then the VA, so there's a kind of gap between when you're-- I presume when you're in the military, 
you've got some support available to you more or less maybe, but there's not any coordination happening 
so that when you get out, you're connected right away to anybody at the VA, either in their mental health 
or physical health departments. 
  
MG: Exactly. There's not. Going back to how I'm different with veterans, I have a right to tell that 
soldier, "Hey, go get that shot. You need to come back for this appointment." I'm talking to them on a 
different level. I'm more personable with them. I think that it would be great if the military had a 
program for veterans like me, that I could have had that option: "Hey, you're getting out. The VA is 
gonna have this position open. If you train, then we can put you right in that position." We need more 
veterans at the VA because they respond better to veterans. If I walk up to a female who's a veteran, 
she's gonna relate. She's gonna listen to me better. I mean, they just do. They have a level of, I'm not 
gonna say respect, but we're more on the same page. We need that more. 
  
AG: Absolutely. It probably is respect, right, knowing that you've been through as difficult a time that 
she's been through, or she can trust your recommendations. I imagine that it actually means better care 
for the patients, if they've got that level of trust and respect for their care providers, for the nurses and 
the practitioners. When you think about your career, does your opinion of nursing or the way you view 
nursing changed over the course of your career, from the different places that you've been employed, or 
just kind of learning more and knowing more and now, sort of being on the verge of being a nurse 
practitioner? 
  
[56:55] MG: Yeah. I mean, I didn't really understand fully before becoming a nurse, of course, what 
nurses do. So, yeah, I think that becoming a nurse, now that I'm a nurse, and obviously going on to be a 
psychiatric nurse practitioner, my views have changed. I know that nurses-- not saying the doctors don't, 
but nurses have a different relationship with patients. I'm there to speak up for them in a sense. I'm going 
to-- if I'm talking to the doctor, which the doctor has all these patients, I'm going to make sure, "Hey, 
why don't you order that?" so I'm there to take care of the patient overall. I didn't know that nurses had 
such a impact on a patient's care. Then becoming a psychiatric nurse practitioner, I think that having a 
 
Library of Congress Archie Green Folklife Fellowship 2020012, Nursing America's Veterans  
18 
 
background as an RN, that I am gonna be on a different level with that patient, because like I said, I'm 
going to look at things differently. I'm looking at it from a different aspect of care. 
  
AG: Similarly, do you have any sense about how the VA itself may have changed over the years? You're 
relatively newer to the VA compared to your career in the military and in other private sector nursing 
roles, but just this sort of the few years that you've been there, do you have any sense of the change? 
  
MG: Yeah. I think that the VA, I think that they are looking at things differently. They understand, and 
they're starting to begin-- I think this is something they've done, they probably noticed before, but 
they're actually taking action. I mentioned the MISSION's Act program. They're understanding that 
veterans live far away, so they're giving them an option to be seen outside of the VA, the non-VA urgent 
care. I think that they're looking at a broader way to take care of veterans and offer them the care that 
they need. I think that is good. As far as that goes, they're just always trying to improve as far as coming 
up with a new technology, being able to talk to veterans per video or telephone, and just having that 
more personable-- allowing the veteran to have the more personable experience and making them feel, 
"Hey, you served our country and we're here to serve you and give you the best care." I think that they 
are, every day, improving and getting up to par to that. 
  
AG: Right now in your career, where you're both going to school and working full-time, and you're still 
a mother, of course, are you also still in the reserves? 
  
MG: No. I separated from the reserves in 2015. But I do work as a infusion nurse, so I have a second 
job, part-time job, where I go into homes and I give infusions, immunoglobulin infusions. I do work 
with veterans there too. So, most of the time I'm working with a veteran. I have a patient now that's a 
veteran. He utilizes the VA. 
  
AG: You know, I don't know what that is. Can you explain that to me, what you're infusing? 
  
MG: Yeah. I infuse immunoglobulins. They call it IGG, and it's pretty much the immune portion of the 
blood. They derive the, I'm gonna say the white blood cells, from blood and give it to patients who are 
immunocompromised. As you can imagine, during a pandemic [chuckles], that was keeping myself safe 
and then also-- and [unintelligible], keeping myself safe from keeping those patients safe, because they 
were very vulnerable to the pandemic, to the COVID virus. 
  
AG: Right. So, you were still going into private homes throughout the pandemic to do these infusions. 
  
MG: Yeah. 
  
AG: So you probably had to suit up-- 
  
MG: Yeah. 
  
AG: And mask, to protect them and yourself. How often do you do that, by the way? It's part-time, you 
said? 
  
 
Library of Congress Archie Green Folklife Fellowship 2020012, Nursing America's Veterans  
19 
 
MG: Yeah, it's part-time. Patients are usually infused every two weeks, every month, whichever the 
doctor prescribes. It's a two-day infusion in most cases. Sometimes you can have a one-day, but majority 
of the time is two days. I work four days a month outside of the home. 
  
AG: Now, when you say two days, does that mean that you are by this patient's side for 48 consecutive 
hours, or do you go and then you leave and you come back, or some combination?  
 
MG: Yeah, so it's like giving blood. I go in, I assess the patient, and then I'll do vital signs, and then I'll 
start an IV. I'll give them the immunoglobulins at a rate using a pump most of the time. [Unintelligible] 
the doctor may prescribe along with medications. Then I'll stay there the whole time the infusion is 
going. Then I will check their vital signs to make sure they're stable and then I'll leave. So, four or five 
hours. 
 
AG: Wow, so it's a lengthy process. It's five hours most of the time. You do that several times a month, 
like for four-ish days? 
 
MG: Or six. 
  
AG: Wow. Have you been doing that the whole time you've been in Tennessee, so about a few years 
there also? 
  
MG: I've been doing that for about three years. 
  
AG: You sound very busy. You have a lot going. If in just the last few minutes if I could ask you just 
some kind of big questions about when you think about your career and your life up to this point, and 
sort of maybe your hopes for the future as well. Is that okay? One thing I was wondering, is there 
anyone in your life who you think of as a professional mentor, or maybe someone who was instrumental 
in supporting you when you were separating from the Navy and going through that difficult period, or 
maybe more than one person who you kind of think of in that way? 
  
MG: [Laughs]. 
  
AG: Or not, and that's okay too. Sometimes, these people don't actually materialize. 
  
[1:04:23] MG: Yeah. I found strength in the military, so I learned to be very independent and work 
independently when I needed to. As I said to you before, I injured myself, and then I ended up going to 
school. If I had to say who impacted me, it was just other nurses that were around me, looking next to 
me and saying that individual who was a student nurse, and then of course, working with nurses who 
were where I wanted to be. I've learned and derived from different individuals throughout my life. I do 
have an aunt that's a nurse and she impacted me knowing that I was, in a sense, following her footsteps. 
She always had this competence about her, so, of course, I looked at that, and it did push me forward 
more. But I've had many people in my life that God has placed in my life to influence me. It's just too 
many to name. But I just kind of kept my head down and set a goal and worked toward it. That's a bad 
answer. 
  
 
Library of Congress Archie Green Folklife Fellowship 2020012, Nursing America's Veterans  
20 
 
AG: No, that's wonderful. And you know what? It makes me wonder, and forgive me if this is too 
personal. Please don't feel any pressure to answer it. Where do you think you found the strength to 
manage that difficult separation from the Navy and overcome homelessness, and to pursue this 
incredibly sophisticated, draining career in healthcare and medicine? Do you think about that time and 
sort of attribute some of that strength to anything in particular? 
  
MG: Yeah. I was raised in East St. Louis, so I just saw a lot growing up, and I knew what I did not want 
to be and I strived to get out of that. I had two children in high school, and I just said, "I refuse," and that 
was it. I just refused it. I wouldn't accept it. I work toward being better for myself and my kids. 
   
AG: Where do you hope to be in 5, 10 years in your career or with your family, or where in the country? 
I know you've moved around quite a bit. If you have any visions of the future or hopes, what are they? 
  
MG: Well, of course, continuing my career at the VA, and I want to implement programs that will help 
veterans there. I aim to make a difference. If I can impact this much-- as many individuals I can impact. 
I see myself retiring from the VA and staying here in Tennessee. I don't plan on leaving Tennessee. 
  
 
AG: I just wanted to ask you before we conclude, are there any things that you'd like to add? Is there 
anything you'd like to add before we say goodbye?   
 
MG: No.  
 
AG: Thank you so much. This was really wonderful. I'm so glad that we got the opportunity to talk and 
to hear about all these incredible experiences you've had. 
 
MG: I'm so glad to be able to share.
