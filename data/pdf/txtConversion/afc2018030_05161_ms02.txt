Mark’s large wood fired kiln is located quite close to his studio building. He makes enough work to fire it 2-3 
times per year.

This is the equipment Mark uses for blunging clay. It is a 55 gallon drum with a mixer/churn inside. He fills it 
with around 30 gallons of water and 300 pounds of clay, and it mixes them together so the clay becomes 
completely saturated. He then pumps out the clay and allows it to dry until it is a good consistency to work with.

The small machine on the floor to the right is a clay mixer. Stacked on the shelf to the left are cylinders of clay 
that have come out of the pug mill and are ready to be used.

This is the part of the studio where Mark and his assistant work. There are two wheels, one for each person, and a 
shelf of pots between them that have been thrown and are now drying. The windows look out toward the kiln 
shed.

The shelves around this part of Mark’s studio hold buckets of glaze or slip that he uses to decorate his pots. Other 
buckets hold a variety of tools.

A selection of jars sit on a shelf in the display room of Mark’s studio. The patterning on them comes from texture 
that is applied on the clay before firing. The glaze then fills the grooves, making dark and light designs on the 
surface where it is thicker or thinner.

The shelves in the display room of Cambridge Wood-Fired Pottery hold a variety of pottery forms, including 
lamps, jars, bowls, oil pourers, plates, teapots, and more.

Mark Skudlarek shows off a large jar that he threw on the wheel. A jar this big is usually made by throwing 
multiple parts and then connecting them before the clay dries.
