Behold, before you, two warriors bold, two warriors who

THE SLIGO MUSKETEERS, 
Words and Music 1:y IIaiux DE7.:NT-TT. 
Written expressly 
for T=N-n-z 
Oh, let yo stand from trid-r now and open wide your cars. 
While we relate the story of the Sligo Musketeer.; ; 
sure. whin we landed on this s&l outWtst thay made us go 
And we worked at canal.ing in the State of Oh-ho-ho. 
But when the war it did break out it took our job away, 
We organized a 
Company and wint into the fray; 
We fought the ragged r ‘bels, boys, for many a 
weary day, 
But they could'ut bate the Sligo Musketeers. 
Cnonus. 
With our ha, ha, ha, ha, hayfoot, straw, we marched across 
the plain, 
And many's the time we thought we'd thought we'd never 
see our homes again; 
The rebels fought like devils but their fighting was in vain, 
For they could'ut bate the Sligo Musteteers. 
We fought wid Banks and Burnside, and wicl Grant we 
took a 
hack, 
But the best of all, though he was small our gallant little 
Mae ; 
Faith ! if they'd let him have his way, he'd curdy drive 
thim back. 
If assisted by the Sligo Musketeers. 
Sure, he knew how to Engineer, likewise to command ; 
No matter what your stationwas he'd take you by the hand. 
He looked so no1.13 on his horse when he was in command 
Of us fighting boys, the Sligo Musketeers. 
With our ha, ha, Ice. 
But now our bre of absence, boys, ia very nearly spint, 
We'd ax you all to take a 
ball, but we're without a 
chat ; 
On Erie shares, and all sued snares, our money it is lint— 
It completely broke the Sligo Musketeers. 
We'll say Good Evening, one and all, your pardon, too, 
we crave, 
We did our duty, manfully, this country for to save; 
May the Shamrock and the Stars and Stripes in triumph 
ever wave, 
O'er the foitnues of the Sligo Musketecr3. 
With our ha, ha, tte.

SONG AND DANCE. 
As sung by T
1;E & CnoNut 
Above all the pretty sights to see 
In the Park, some afternoon; 
When all the pretty girls are out, 
Like roses in full bloom. 
'Twas at the Park I 
lost my heart, 
'While there the other day, 
I 
sat beside a 
charming girl, 
When the Band began to play. 
CHORUS. 
Oh ! those sweet strains they linger yet. [Break. 
Reminds me of the time we met. [ Break. 
Oh ! how I 
loved this little beauty, 
And blessed that happy day 
That fate led us to the Central Park, 
When the Band begin to play. 
Next evening, as I 
passed her house, 
I 
called, my love to see ; 
We wandered on, side by side— 
'Twas hours of bliss to me ; 
We spoke about the sweet music, 
As the moments passed away. 
Oh ! how I 
felt, I'll ne'cr forget, 
When the Band began to play. 
Chorus as before. 
THE SELDOM FED BRIGADE.' 
._Worda.and Music by HARRY BENNETT. 
Written expressly 
For TIERNEY & CRONIN. 
We are the Seldom Fed Brigade, 
As you can plainly see; 
We often have to miss our meals— 
With us it don't agree! 
One meal a 
day is all we get,' 
For that we have to fight; 
Oatmeal for breakfast, wind for lunch, 
And a 
walk around at night. 
Cuonus. 
We're the Seldom Fed Brigade, 
For fighting we're not paid, 
And for our grub we get a 
club— 
That's how our soup is made; 
If soon we are not paid, 
We'll have to make a 
raid, 
To drive starvation fiorn 
The seldom Fed Brigade. 
If we could strike a 
Hash Mill, or 
A Lunch Route on the street, 
You bet, our stomachs we would fill— 
We'd chow you how to eat. 
We'll pulverize a 
Restaurant, 
Or clean out a 
Hotel ; 
If we can't get a 
square meal, why 
Just let us take a 
smell. 
CHORUS. 
Wind pudding's'all we get to eat, 
I 
Of that we're awful sick ; 
.1 
And if we ask for other grub 
i 
They'll hit us with a 
brick. 
We'll soon be healthy skeletons. 
Our clothes are getting loose ;: 
Oh! If you want to see us bust, 
Just chuck us down a 
goose. 
Written by W . 
BLTANT. 
Sung by TIERNEY & CRCS= 
What should make you cat, my darling, 
Soup, cabbage, and pickles too; 
Turkey, pork, and fried potatoes, 
Oysters fried and oysters stew ; 
Prairie chicken and tomatoes, 
Butterfly spread on dry toast. 
Oh! my darling, you must quit it, 
For Fin sure you'll have to bust. 
Boast beef, corn'd beef and horse- radish, 
What a 
dish of them you eat; 
Eggs and fish, and sweet potatoes, 
Pickled tail and pickled feet ; 
Ice cream, doughnuts, rind clam chowder, 
Taste so good, as you say ; 
Oh! my love, you ought to know it, 
You eat 16 square meals a 
day. 
Roosters stuffed with hot, dry ashes, 
Pheasants stuffed with pickled eels ; 
Catfish broiled in sour molasses, 
Ostrich eggs with nigg.ers' heeL3; 
Kittens fried in nice strong butter, 
Tadpoles, crawfish, and big whales; 
Elephant ears and rotten tomatoes, 
Hoopskirts broiled on monkeys' tail% 
SLENDER NIGS. 
Written for TIERNEY & CRONEC, by W. BEILIST. 
Oh, here we are, two slender Nigs 
As you can plainly see ; 
Come out to take a 
stroll, 
And see what we can see ; 
It's our delight to dance at night, 
Your favors try to win; 
You'll see that we are full of life, 
Although we are so thin. 
CHORUS. 
They call him dancing Pete. [Sympb. 
Just watch him throw his feet. [Symph. 
You bet, we are two thoroughbreds, 
Me and Brother Jim; 
The ladies fall in love with us, 
Because we are tio thin. 
But now kind friends we'll bid adieu, 
We can no longer stay; 
We'll dance a 
little step or two, 
Before we'll go away; 
And if by chance we'll see you here, 
Some time that we'll drop in, 
You'll not forget us lively Mokes, 
Although we are so thin. 
(Chorus as before,. 
THE rie of the day, in the old world and new, 
Is to make lots of money, and stick to it to! 
Grab all you can, and never leave hold, 
Is the maxim that's taught, in this era of gold, 
Is the maxim that's taught, in this era of gold, 
CHORUS. 
For it comes and it goes, and it goes and it comes, 
And it comes and it goes, and goes and it comes, 
Yes it comes, hat ha! ha l

But it goes oh ! oh I

If you open a 
bank, and then with a

At the end of a

Pop thro' the court, ' tis the ea-si-est way, 
Save a 
fortune and then, to your creditors say, 
Sate a

For it comes, &G. 
If a 
man and his wife, in the morning have words; 
Her looks are so sour, that the cream turns to curd, 
Her looks are so sour, that the cream turns to curds, 
If you talk of a 
bonnet, she'll straighten her lips, 
And a 
smile sweet as sugar, when you show her the chiwi, 
She'll smile sweet as sugar, when you show her the chips. 
For it comes, &o. 
With plenty of cash, you can do as you please, 
While other folks work, you can do as you pleaze, 
While other folks work, you can do as you please, 
But one thing reinemb,r, between you and I, 
Your smile:: are a

Your smiles are a

By COL. CLAUDE DE HAVEN. 
The roses have bloomed for the last timq, 
The violets are folded to rest, 
The daisies and butter-cups lying 
Entomb'd on the pimpernel's breast ; 
The meadow lark's song has _bated, 
The robin chirps high on its way 
To the land of the magnolia flowers, 
For the Summer is dying to- day. 
The forest with green blended yellow, 
is changing its hue to the sere ; 
The orchard with fruit ripe and mellow, 
Proclaim ' tis the end of the year. 
When flowers shall bloom in their beauty, 
And birds sing their happiest lay--
The harvest is all garnered safely, 
For the Summer is dying to- day. 
Dying! yes, flowers and humanity, 
Fond affections and friends we deemed pure, 
Dead are the feelings of others 
To the sorrows we may endure. 
Happy thought 
blessil the vision ! 
May we all leave a 
mark on our way, 
To that land of the bright Elysium, 
While the Su:nrnis dying- to- lay.

Music, Price, IC cts. 
WHAT legi us 
f 
friends always bless us, 
When golden success gilds our way, 
How they smile as they softly address us 
So cordial, good humor'd and gay. 
But, oh! if the sun ( f 
prosperity 
Has set, then how quickly they frown, 
And cry out in tones of severity, 
Kick the man, don't you see he is down? 
CuoRus. 
So let all your hearts be honest and true, 
And do unto others as you'd have them to do; 
Sickness and sorrow t! ay fall unto you, 
So lift up a 
man when he's down ! 
What if, when you had not a 
sorrow 
Your heart was as open as day, 
Your friends when they wantA to bor.ow 
You'd oblige, and ne'er ask them to pay 
What, if then, -a 
friend you ne'er slighted 
You•wander atout through the town 
Yo ...r friend became very near sig-hted 
And don't seem to sce you when down. 
Ciamzus.—So let all your, 4k.c.. 
Then give me the heart that for ever 
Is free fr ma the ,,
vorld's selfish rust, 
And the soal whose liii, noble endeavor, 
Is to r..ise fa:len men from the dust. 
And when in a 
versit:,'s ocean, 
A 
victim is 
to drown, 
All hail to the friend whose devotion 
Will lift al) a 
man when he's down! 
let all your, ctc. 
Though full oft I've heard the story, 
Of a 
rather drowned at sea— 
knd of sick heart-broken Mother— 
Some impostor they may be; 
Yet I 
mind me, one who spurned not 
Such as these in days of yore; 
Left to us the truthful saying, 
Ever with you are the poor. 
23 
[Chorus as before. 
If above thee, God has blest me 
With a 
bounteous earthly store— 
His approval—I 
will ask no more— 
Should I 
turn thee from my door? 
When the last account is rendered, 
May the welcome sentence be, 
Like as unto these ye've given, 
So ye've given unto me.

HAVEN. 
There comes a 
time when we grow old, 
And like a 
sunset down the sea, 
Slope gradual, and the night wind co:d 
Comes whispering, sad and chilling I 
And locks are gray 
As Winter's day, 
And eyes of saddest blue behold 
The leaves all weary drift away, 
And lips of faded coral say, 
There comes a 
time when we grow old. 
There comes a 
time when joyous hearts, 
Which leaped as leaped the laughing main, 
Are dead to all save memory, 
As prisoners in hls dungeon chain. 
And dawn of day 
Hath pAssed away, 
The moon bath into darkness rolled ; 
And by the mornin7„ wan and gray. 
I 
hear a 
voice in whisper say, 
There com ,
ss a 
time when we grow old.. 
There comes a 
time when mataLc-,od's prime 
Is shrouded in the mist of years, 
And beauty, fading like a 
dream, 
Hath passed away in silent tears ; 
And then how dark! 
But oh! the spark 
That kindles youth to hues of gold, 
Still burns with clear and steady ray, 
And fond affections lingering, say, 
There comes a 
time when we grow old. 
There comes a 
timo when laughing Spring 
And golden Summer cease to be, 
And we put on the Autumn ro.be 
To trelid the last declivity ; 
But now the slope 
With rosy hope, 
Beyond the sunset we behold— 
Another dawn with fairer light, 
While watchers whisper through the night. 
There comes a 
time when we grow old.

WHILE strolling by a 
running brook, 
One evening in July, 
I 
met a 
maid so lovely, 
I 
winked at her so sly. 
Der eyes shone like the brilliant stars, 
That winked at us, you know, 
I 
took her hand and led her on 
Down where the violets grow. 
CHORUS. 
For she is a 
fairy queen, 
The fairest ever seen, 
I 
bless the day she came that way, 
Don where the violets grow. 
I 
gathered flow. rs and decked her hair, 
And called her my sweet dove, 
She whispered very softly 
You are the one I 
love. 
I 
asked her then to come again 
Where tl.e waters rippling flow, 
She murmured as she kissed my cheek, 
Down where the violets grow. 
Cherus. 
she is, ets. 
Ah, had you seen the look she gave, 
You'd ne'er forget I 
ween, 
It was not gay, it was not grave, 
But something just between: 
Then from her rosy lips there came 
A 
little word I 
need not name, 
If'twas not " yes" it meant the same. 
For now she reigns my Queen. 
CHORUS. 
So thus you see the look she gave 
Among the blooming flowers of May, 
Has changed my heart—we ne'er will part, 
What will her father say.

PULL DOWN THE BLIND. 
As sung by TONY PASTOR:, 
DID you ever make love ? If not, have a 
try, 
I 
courted a 
girl once, so bashful and shy, 
A 
fair little creature who by the by, 
At coaxing and wheedling had such a 
nice way; 
Ev'ry night to her house I 
went, 
In harmless delight our evenings were spent, 
She had a 
queer saying, whatever it meant, 
For whenever I 
entered her house she would say 
CHORUS. 
Pull down the blind, pull down the blind, 
Pull down the blind, love, come don't be unkind, 
Though we're alone, bear this in mind, 
Somebody's looking, love, pull down the blind. 
How loving we were, how cosy we'd chat, 
'Bout one thing and Vother, and this thing and that, 
With my arm round her waist., how cosy we sat, 
Like two little turtle-doves perched on a 
tree; 
Such squeezing and teasing and pleasing we had— 
Such wooing and cooing to make our hearts glad, 
With laughing and chaffing I 
near drove her mad; 
But still she was awfully spooney on me; 
SPOREN.—And if that soldier would only have left us 
she would never have exclaimed: 
Pull down the blind, etc. 
, 31 
Due night, for a 
change, we went to the play, 
And when we got home she was awfully gay, 
he saw them make love, and so learned the way, 
The piece was " Claude llelnotte," and suited her fine; 
She called me her rose- bud, her duck, and her dear, 
She threw her arms round me, while fast fell each tear; 
She cried, oh, don't leave me, for sadly I 
fear 
You don't love me truly, say, will you be mine? 
SPORFN,—Just at that moment a 
policemm passed, and she 
said: 
Pull down the blind, etc. 
Our courting days o'er, at last we were wed, 
I 
oft bless the hour when to church her I 
led, 
I 
now call her Mary, she calls me Ned, 
We're happy and loving, and never know strife; 
We've a 
fine handsome lass, and two noble boys, 
Trouble or sorrow, never us annoys; 
Of life we've the sweets, and while tasting its joys, 
I'm thankful I'm blessed with a 
good little w.fe. 
SPOKEN.—And should an angry word rise to my lips, with a 
meek smile on her face she'll exclaim:

Now please give me attention 
To what I

And I'll tell you of the by- words

The young and old both use them, 
But the boys can say them best; 
And the latest one of them all 
Is, " Young Man, Pull Down your Vest."

Now, no matter where you go, 
To North, South, East or West, 
You'll surely hear the latest one, 
Which is, " Pull Down Your Vest." 
The other day, while walking out, 
I 
stopp'd to light my pipe, 
When I 
heard some boys remark,

Don't give me none of your " chin !" 
There's Mary Ann, my eldest daughter— 
The one that I 
love best--
Since she has learned to " Tra La-La-Lou," 
She says, " Pull down your Vest !" 
Now, no matter, a. 
Now, I'll bid you's all farewell! 
As I 
must be leaving you; 
And when you come another time, 
I'll sing some more to you; 
And when you hear these by-words, 
You'll surely know the best; 
Then when your friends ask you to treat, 
You must say, " Pull down your Vest r

THE ROMAN FALL. 
As sung by Miss ELLA W ESNEIL 
You've heard of the " Grecian Bend," 
And you know bow the iadies appear; 
On the tips of their toes, with their high bea'd shoe, 
It's amusing to watch them all. 
Without wishing to offend, 
I've invented a 
fashion, I'll swear— 
Will be followed out, too, as its something new, 
And I 
call it the " Roman Fall.' 
Criones. 
For if ladies still intend 
To follow out the " Grecian Bend," 
Take notice, you men, all, 
The latest thing's the " Roman Fall I" 
Head back, the chest well out, 
A 
walk between a 
shuffle and a 
crawl; 
The long, the short, ';helean, the stout, 
Mutt try the " Roman Fall !" 
Now you know as the ladies, of late, 
Have so very ridiculous grown; 
Made themselves such guys, to appear in the eyes 
Of the gentlemen all in all. 
They will not be at all elate 
At the fashion we have of our own; 
For I 
quite intend to out-do the " B6rid," 
By the beautiful " Roman Fall !" 
For if ladiPs, ice. 
I 
girl with the " Grecian Bend," 
Has a 
terrible trial to endure ; 
She must walk on her toes, and perhap?, 
11 ,2r nose 
May come bump lm ft7ainst a 
wall. 
41 
With the fashion that I 
recommend 
Our noses are safe I 
am sure ; 
For you'll find instead, it's the back of the head 
Will be hurt by the " Roman Fall." 
For if ladies, 
Now I 
hope what I've said to- night, 
Will sink in your memories deep; 
That you'll clearly see the necessity 
Of adopting it, one and all; 
'Twill serve the dear ladies right, 
And prove that we are not asleep, 
If we boldly show there are none of us slow 
In producing the " Roman Pall I" 
For if ladies, Sic. 
SPOREN.—When the ladies bend before us it shows they 
are inclined to stoop to our superiority, and such a 
feast of 
humbleness invites us to fall to. 
And the "Roman For 
shows we are Beaux to the back-bone. 
And by extending 
our manly breasts, " Ohestify" ourselves in receiving the 
little benten forms on our lordly protuberances, and pil-
lowing their heads on those ribs from whence they sprung. 
Yes, gentlemer we must show the dear girls that we can 
adopt fashions as ridiculous as their own. 
But really, the 
ladies have become o 
forward of lath, that it 
not surpri-
sing that we should be a 
little backward. 
I ' good figure 
is always admired, and a 
fall in the back I 
consider espe-
cially graceful. 
The ladies always admire a 
fall in the 
back. 
And without conceit, I 
think I 
may say I've got it 
But don't be envious, don't be envious, gentlemen ; only 
take my advice, and you'll be as fascinating as I 
am.

Every Eve we sit together. 
'Neath the Sycamore tree,

She sings to me so sweetly. 
The songs I

She charms me so completely, 
When she finishes each verse 
I 
kiss her and tell her not to tell. 
Good Night l 
She's my pretty little 
And my little flower of joy. 
I'm as joyful as the birds 
That warble in the trees ; 
My bliss, like theirs, without alloy; 
When our wedding-day is over, 
I'll live among the clover, 
With this pretty little flower of joy. 
Away with all your Belles, 
None with mine can compare; 
My Kittie—my love— my life— 
The Queen of all the fur ! 
Away with all your B11.-:

None with mine call compare ;

It fills me with delight, on a

To walk with my pretty Kittie dear : 
And vow to her such love as or.ly liver's might, 
To the one whom they dearly revere. 
Last evening we were walking 
Where the moon did brightly shine, 
I 
asked her, there, to be my own dear wife; 
She answered, yes, so sweetly, 
'Neath blushes fair and rosy— 
Our happiness shall ever be most rife,

MY name is Roger O'Malley, understand, 
And don't begin for to doubt me; 
I 
own my own house, and a 
bit o' land, 
There's no common stock about me. 
I 
went to college when a 
boy. 
And left with heaps of lore; 
And came out here to this free land, 
Just pravious to the war. 
CifoRUS. 
Roger O'Mtdley, that's my name, 
Quite famous I 
have grown; 
I'm far superior to Muldoon, 
Mulcahey or Malone. 
I'm quite independent in my way, 
Iligh-ton'd and \veil educated; 
All my taxes I'm ready for to pay, 
And I'm not in the least dissipated_ 
can take a 
drink, and smoke a 
cigar, 
With comfort and delight; 
But you'll never see me loafin' round 
The whiskey bars at night. 
Roger O'Malley, ace. 
I'm as dacent a 
man as you can find, 
Like all my seven generations; 
With a 
good deal of laming in my mind, 
Which I 
use on important occasions; 
I'm far above yer common scraps, 
That fling their names all round, 
And they'll not catch me in any traps, 
For I'm sensible and sound. 
Roger O'Malley, 
I'm a 
marshal whenever we parade, 
I 
ride a 
horse from Araby; 
With a 
big stick of honor in my hand, 
Sure, in martial affairs I'm no baby. 
I 
ate my till, anti wear good clothes, 
Made up in the style you see; 
My walk is grand, and plainly shows 
That there's no such man as me.

SHE. 
Old man, what is the matter, what makes you look so blue? 
Is it anything that this little girl has said or done to you ? 
If so, I 
feel so sorry, to make you look so sad, 
And if you have come home again, I'm sure you should 
be glad. 
HE. 
Oh no, my child, it's nothing you've said or done to me, 
But I'm all alone in this world, without friend or family ; 
And now I've nothing left me but for to pine and sigh, 
And hunt me out a 
resting place to lay me down and die, 
SHE. 
I'm sure you oughtn't to feel so, for I'm an orphan too, 
My father's gone for a 
soldier and donn'd the army blue! 
I 
suppose that he is dead, for we've never receiv'd a 
line, 
And I 
know that he is in his grave way down in Caroliias„ 
It's now about ten years ago I 
left old Aunty Sue; 
I 
ran away for a 
soldier, put on the army blue; 
I 
left here my dear old wife, and Susan was her name, 
And now I 
find that she is dead, I 
wish that I 
were the 
same, 
LET MY PEOPLE GO. 
END SONG—AS 
Sling by GEO. STANSILII. 
Brother and ray Sister, and I 
tell you, 
Let my people go; 
I'm gwine to put on de golden shoe, 
Let my people go; 
And straight to glory I 
will go, 
Let my people go; 
For de Angel Gabriel told me so, 
Let my people go. 
CHORUS. 
Way down in Moses; Way down in Egypt's land. 
Tell Old Pharaoh to let my people go. 
G- eat big Nigger on a 
little fence, 
Let my people go ; 
A 
talking to a 
fat Nigger Wench, 
Let my people go ; 
The fence it broke and dey got a 
fall, 
Let my people go; 
Down come fence, Nigger Wench and all! 
Let my people go. 
Way down in, &A. 
Now, of good things, I 
get the best, 
Let my people go ; 
Take my advice, young man, go West 
Let my people go : 
A 
Schooner of Beer only costs Five Gents! 
Let my people go; 
'And when you get full you've got no sense! 
Let my people go. 
Way down in, it"

THINGS' THAT OCCUR EVERY- DAL 
(After 
Crime.") 
To MB. HARRY STANWOOD. Banjoist and Comedian. 
by -SAMUEL N. 
lirrenzu.. 
I'VE been dreaming—oh, yes I've been dreaming.", 
Of things that occur ev'ry day; 
I've been dreaming of people who worry 
And plod through the world in dismay; 
They grumble at all that's around them, 
And snarl like a 
curlin the street, 
While, if you attempt to approach them, 
They'll sq.:1m like a 
snake at your feet. 
This world is as good as ! hey make them, 
But snarlers, I 
say, we must " shake" them; 
For, no matter what v 
ay you may take then% 
wo.ry and grumble the same. 
I've been dreaming— oh, yes, I've been dreaming... 
Of men who pretend to be tine, 
But neglect their poor wives and their daughters; 
That they may seek pleasure, and shine; 
They flirt tn the strcets and the highways, 
And car. y 
a 
proud, errpty hea 
While in some dark alley or by ways 
Their children are crying for bread. 
Why m n 
act so queer and so bold, sir. 
Is not at all strange; far we're told, sir, 
That a 
score of poor women are sold, sir, 
By armies of rascals like ti—,
2e. 
I've Ix en dreaming—oh, yes, I've been drou!-!!!ing— 
Of women who try to do well, 
But are always abused by their husbands 
For failings too numerous to tell; 
If 
let als ain't cooked right to suit them, 
They'll curse ev'ry thing in the land ; 
And if the puor woman disputes them, 
She'll feel the effects of a 
hand. 
A 
wife should be ever respected, 
And never at all he neglected, 
For surely she must feel affected 
At treatment she often receives. 
I've been dreaming— oh, yes I've been dreaming— 
Of days in the future I 
see, 
When acts of the present will vanish, 
And all will be happy and free; 
As things at this time are progressing, 
A 
change f 
r 
the better we ! eed 
For now it is really distressing 
To look on each dastardly deed 
Let e 
ery one hereabouts plead it 
For surely a 
ch no.e is much needed, 
And now is the time we should lead It, 
And have a 
reform in our and.

This is DELEHANTY & CUMMINGS' Champion Song it Dance, 
As I 
strolled out one evening, 
The Sun had just gone down, 
While leisurely meandering

With eyes the brightest blue, 
Beneath her dark eye-lashes, 
Like Violets dipped in dew.

A

A 
dreamy, soft expression, 
Like Violets dipped in dew.

I 
think she knew it well, 
And as a 
sweet reminder, 
Her handkerchief it fell; 
I 
raised the scented linen 
From off the grassy ground; 
Her name, in letters crimson, 
On one corner there I 
found.

She deigned to smile upon me, (Symph.) 
That moment she had won me, 
My heart it pierced me through; 
There's some sweet charm entrancing, 
Within her eyes so blue ; 
A 
dreamy soft expression, 
Like Violets dipped in dew. 
At length I 
did approach her, 
And ventured into talk, 
By asking her permission 
To join her lonely walk ; 
She blushing, frowning, smiling, 
Said, " Oh ! I 
think you're rude ;" 
But those blue eyes, beguiling, 
Seemed to say, I 
wish you would.

And entirely shook the gang.

He goes to church every Sunday now, 
And works then all the week, 
He stays home in the evening, 
He no longer roams the street; 
He never goes to bops or balls, 
Or strikes the door the oule bang; 
Oh, our hearts are filled with joy, my friends, 
Since Terry shook the gang.

THE DAUGHTER OF CHARLOTTE TEMPLE 
No one who has read the touching account of the 
misfortunes of Charlotte Temple, with that absorb-
ing interest which is inseparable from Mrs., Row-
son's writings, can rest satisfied while denying them-
selves a 
perusal cf the life of Charlotte Temple's 
Daughter, Lucy femple. 
It is a 
sequel possessed of all the thrilling in-
terest that characterizes the life of the unfortunate 
mother, while it exemplifies in a 
wonderful manner 
" 
the visitation of the sins of the parents upon the 
children." 
r 
It depicts sorrows that refuse the balm of sym-
pathy, and consolations which those arcund us 
" 
can neither give nor take away." 
It contrasts in 
living colors the richest fruits of virtue and happi-
ness on the one hand, and the bitter end, blighting 
disappointments and ruir resulting from once yield-
ing to the seductive influence of passion. 
It points a 
moral that commends it to the atten-
tion of all, and is pervaded by an interest that will 
hold the reader in vapi attention to the end.

A Beautiful "7.loth Cilt Volume. 
/ Read what two leading New York papers say of it. 
The New 
York Evening Mail writes: 
A 
little book has lately appeared in print at Messrs. Fisher & 
Denison's, 98 Nassau street, called "The Little Flirt." 
We cannot 
wry that we recommend it to our young lady and gentlemen readers, 
as we think it would only encourage the bad b- bit of "flirting." 
Unfortunately there is enough of it done without any further neces-
sity of explaining"how, when and where to do it,' and this little 
volume would advise and init iate the uncorrupted in practising what 
is commonly called "flirting." 
The N. Y. Evening Telegram writes: 
We have lately seen a 
neat little book, bound in morocco, costing 
25 cents, called "The Little Flirt," published by Messrs. Fisher Sr 
Denison, 98 Nassau street. 
It gives information of the modus oper-
andi of flirting, and of the meani ng of 
every moti
on 
of 
the hand-
kerchief, fan, glove and parasol. As there is nothing at all objec-
tionable in the volume, and its contents might afford some innocent 
amusement to many, we do not hesitate to recommend it to our 
young lady and gentlemen readers. 
The LITTLE FLIRT contains Fourteen Silhouette Illus 
trations. 
Is bound with bevelled edges and gilt sides.

ENDORSEMENTS OF THE PRESS. 
The highest praise which can be given to this excellent 
elementary work on practical mechanics, consists in the fol-
lowing simple statement of facts : The editor of this journal, 
while teaching natural philosophy and chemistry in the 
Cooper Institute from 1859 to 1864, was in need of a 
text-
book of practical mechanics, adapted to the advanced classes 
who had been trained in mathematics; in his search among 
the many mechanical text- books, there was not one which so 
fully answered his requirements as the above work. 
It was 
therefore adopted and used with perfect satisfaction, and it 
is with pleasure that he receives it now as an old friend from 
the publishers, gives it his most ea-nest recommendation, 
and wishes it it, the hands of all who are still in the fog about 
the units of work, calculation of the power of machinery, 
resistance to motion, strain on material, etc.—Manufactarer 
and Builder, July, 1874. 
J 
The author of this work is well known as an extensive 
wiiter who has made some valuable additions to American 
technical literature, enumerated above in detail. 
The work 
we are now noticing is a 
theoretical treatise on practical me-
chanics, designed to supply a 
recognized deficiency. 
Most 
of the works on mechanics treat the subject in a manner 
which is not available to young men commencing as appren-
tices in shops. 
Any young man with a 
fair knowiedge of 
arithmetic may, however, use this work to great advantage ; 
it is not only suitable for a 
text-book, but also as a woik 
of reference. 
Most ambitious young men will make them-
selves so familiar with its contents as to be hole to refer 
readily to any portion of the book. 
The author has adopted 
a 
new notation to distinguish units of work from other units, 
which is not without value, and might be advantageously 
introduced into more ambitious works. 
The book is well 
printed on good white paper, and bound in stiff cloth covers.
