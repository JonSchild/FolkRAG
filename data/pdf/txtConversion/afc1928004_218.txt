GUS WILLIAMS' AUTOGRAPH SONGSTER. 
TO THE PUBLIC. 
IN 
presenting this fresh collection of my melodies to the 
public as a 
companion to my previous budget of original comic 
character songs and stories, I 
have no excuse to offer beyond 
a 
desire that my friends and admirers may have within their 
reach my compositions in their primitive purity. 
It is unfor-
tunate that I 
cannot be personally present in different towns 
and cities to put to the blush the innumerable quacks and 
mountebanks who, from the stage, enleavor to palm off their 
weak imitations as my original conceptions, for that would be a 
work rivalling the labors of Hercules. 
Nevertheless, I 
can— 
and deem it a 
duty so to do—put the public on their guard 
against fraudulent imposters, as far as the words and senti-
ments of. my songs are concerned, and this is a 
reason for their 
reproduction in type, as they, from time to time, achieve popu-
larity in various parts of the Union. 
I 
have devoted no space in this volume to publication of no-
tices of the press, inasmuch as its voice has ever been raised 
in my praise; and it would be a much harder task for me to 
chase up a 
single denunciatory notice than to parade before the 
public a 
thousand complimentary and most friendly commenda-
tions, meeting the at every point, during a 
persistent career to 
deserve and earn popular favor. 
That I 
have achieved, in my particular sphere of usefulness, 
something in the way of greatness has been my good fortune, 
as it has been my aim never to offend a 
fastidious taste; and 
as long as a 
generous and amused public continues to regard 
my endeavors to please with favor, I 
shall always be pleased to 
Subscribe myself their humble servant,

THE MULLIGAN GUARD. 
By kind permission of HARRIGAN and HART. 
Entered according to Act of Congress, in the year 1873, by NED HABRIG", 
in the Office of the Librarian of longress, at %+ ashington, D. C. 
Composed and sung by ElenntaAN and HART, with immense success, at the 
Theatre (_ oinique, New York. 
W E 
crave your condescension, 
And we'll tell you what we know 
Of marching iti the Mulligan Guards 
From the seventh ward below; 
And our Captain's name was Hussey— 
A 
Tipperary man— 
He carried his sword like the Russian Duke, 
Whenever he took command. 
CHORUS. 
We shouldered guns, 
And marched, and marched away 
From Jackson Street 
Way up to Avenue A. 
Drums and fifes did sweetly, sweetly play, 
As we marched, marched, marched in the Mulligan Guards. 
When the band play'd Garryowen or the Connemarro pet, 
With the rub, dub, dub, we marched in the mud— 
To the military step— 
With the green above the red, boys, 
To show where we came from ; 
Our guns we'd lift, 
With the right shoulder shift, 
As we marched to the beat of the drum. 
We shouldered, etc. 
When we'd get home at night, boys, 
The divil a 
wink we'd sleep; 
We'd all set up and drink a 
sup 
Of whiskey, strong and neat. 
Then we'd all march home together 
As slippery as lard; 
The solid men would all fall in, 
And march in the Mulligan Guard. 
We shouldered, etc.

Salt water, you know, is very wet, 
Oh, Nicodemus! 
You know you are my only pet, 
And your absence will cause me to fume and fret. 
They will feed you on salt junk 
And nasty soft-boiled peas; 
Think of this well, Nicodemus, 
Ere you cross those watery seas, 
Those windy, watery seas.— Cho. 
Of pumpkins boiled you'll get no more, 
Oh, Nicodemus I 
Convince yourself of this before, 
You can't run away, there's no back-door. 
"Reef the anchor, Nicodemus I" 
The captain he will say; 
You'll have to hold on by your eye-brows 
Or you'll be blown away 
Straight down to Botany Bay.—Cho. 
It is no use your talking to me, 
Said Nicodemus; 
For I 
intend a-going to sea, 
Out to China for Souchong and Congo tea. 
That's a 
profitable cargo, 
In fact, you can't get better; 
Direct " Hong Kong," Australia, 
Where you send me a 
letter, 
. You send to me a 
letter.— Cho..

" PLEASE GOD, 
MAKE ROOM FOR A LITTLE - 
BOY !" 
Entered Recording to Act of Congress, in the year 1874, by Wurrs and 
GouLLAun, in the Office of the Librarian of Congress, Washington, D. U. 
These were the last words of " Americus," the well-known child violinist, 
seven years of age, who expired very suddenly during the night of January 
10th, 1874, in Boston 
So quietly did his spirit take its flight, that ins 
father, who occupied the same room, although hearing his son make the 
foregoing exclamation, thougnt the Loy was talking in his sleep, and was 
horrified to find the little child, cold in death, in the morning. 
The Music of this Song is published by W HITE & GOULLAuD, 86 Tremont 
St., Boston, Mass. 
Price 35 cents. 
Written by DEXTER &Arm. Music by SIDNEY GRAVES. 
" 
GOOD night, father!" said our darling, as he sank to sweet 
repose, 
Like a 
bird his gleeful music died away at twilight's close, 
And a 
smile came o'er his features radiant with holy joy, 
As if angels came to whisper tidings to our little boy.

" 
Good night, father!" said our darling, as he sank to sweet 
repose, 
Like a 
bird his gleeful music died at, died at twilight's close. 
When night draped her sable curtain, hanging folds upon each 
star, 
Came a 
halo soft and lustrous, streaming o'er the window bar; 
And we heard our darling murmur, as the brightness lit his face, 
" 
Please God, make me room in Heaven, make your little boy a 
place !" 
" 
Good night, father!" said our darling, as be sank to sweet 
repose, 
Like a 
bird his gleeful music died away at twilight's close.

Good night, father 
etc. 
He was weary of the struggle, discords jarred upon his soul; 
And his gentle spirit left us, wafted to the heavenly goal; 
He has room among the angels, he is freed from sin and care; 
God, who watcheth e'en the sparrow, answered little Jimmie's 
prayer.

'TIS EVENING BRINGS MY 
'
HEART TO THEE. 
Words by Miss Ferrstr CROSBY. 
Musk by HENRY Tocren. 
The Music of this Song is published by War. A. POND & CO., 547 and 865 
Broadway, New York. Price 35 cents. 
'Tis evening brings my heart to thee, 
When all is lovely, calm and still; 
That welcome hour so dear to me, 
When purest thoughts my bosom fill I 
The bird flies homeward to its nest, 
The zephyr woos the wand'ring bee, 
The dewdrop seeks the lily's breast, 
So evening brings my heart to thee. 
CHORUS. 
To thee! to thee! 
'Tis evening brings my heart to thee. 
A 
truant beam returns again 
To mingle with the orb of day; 
A 
streamlet, winding through the glen, 
Will lose itself in ocean spray; 
And when the sky with beauty glows, 
And starry eyes look on the sea, 
When weary nature seeks repose, 
Then evening brings my heart to thee. 
To thee! to thee, etc. 
Oh! I 
could linger at thy side, 
And dream away my every care; 
Or fancy life a 
silver tide, 
With not a 
wave to ripple there; 
Though fortune frown and coldly spurn, 
And mine a 
chequered path must be, 
menalry's lamp shall cease -to burn, 
-Will evening bring my heart. to.thee. 
To thee! to thee, etc.

KILLARNEY.--,-pmeruDze. 
Innisfallen's ruined shrine 
May suggest a 
passing sigh; 
But man's faith can ne'er decline, 
Such God's wonders floating by. 
Castle Lough and Glenn Bay, 
Mountains Tore and Eagles' Nest, 
Still at Mucross you must pray, 
Though the. monks are now at rest. 
Angels wonder not that man 
There would fain prolong life's span : 
Beauty's home, Killarney, 
Ever fair Killarney. 
No place else can charm the eye 
With such bright and varied tints, 
Every rock that you pass by, 
Verdure broiders or besprints ; 
Virgin there the green grass grows, 
Every morn spring's natal day, 
Bright-hued berries doff the snows, 
Smiling winter's frown away. 
Angels often pausing there, 
Doubt if Eden were more fair: 
Beauty's home, Killarney 
Ever fair Killarney. 
Music there for echo dwells, 
Makes each sound a 
harmony, 
Many-voiced the chorus swells, 
Till it faints in ecstasy. 
With the charmful tints below 
Seems the heaven above to vie, 
All rich colors that we know, 
Tinge the cloud-wreaths in that sky. 
Wings of angels so might shine, 
Glancing back soft light divine : 
Beauty's home, Killarney, 
Ever fair Killarney.

IN 
Derry- down-dale, when I 
wanted a 
mate, 
I 
went with my feyther a-courtin' to Kate: 
With a 
nosegay so fine in my holiday clothes, 
And my hands in my pockets a- courting I 
goes. 
Now the weather was cool but my bosom was tot, 
My heart in a 
gallop, my old mare in a 
trot, 
And I 
was so baslifnl, so loving withal, 
My tongue stuck in my moutn and I 
said—nothing at all.

But I

couldn't, how could II 
I 
couldn't without it, now could 1—could you? 
Fol the rol de rol, lol de rol, lol de rol lay, 
Fol the rol de rol, lol de rol, lol de rol lay. 
When I 
came to the door, I 
looked glumpish and glum, 
The rapper I 
held ' twixt my finger and thumb— 
Rap, rap ! went the rapper, Miss Kate showed her chin: 
She ; buckled and buckled, I 
bowed and went in. 
Now I 
was as bashful as bashful conld be, 
And Kitty, poor ,girl, was as bashful as me ; 
She simpered and frowned, I 
let my hat fall, 
I 
grinned, scratched my head, and said—nothing at all. 
But I 
would if I 
could, etc. 
Now if bashful was I, not less bashful the maid, 
Se simpered and whimpered, with her apron-strings played, 
Till the old folks impatient to have the thing done, 
Arced little Kitty and I 
should be one. 
In silence we young uns soon nodded conset.t, 
g 
hand in hand to the church, to get married, we went. 
Where we answered the parson, in voices quite small, 
Love, honor, obey, and— nothing at all. 
But we would if we could, etc. 
Now what a 
chancre in the course of a 
week ! 
Miss Kate left off blushin ,r, I

Ashamed of past follies, we often declare 
We'll encourage young folks to have in wedlock a

And if to their aid some assurance they call, 
They may kiss, and get married. and do—nothing at all.

TT-TPI SILVER SLIPPER 
Bong with Two Posture Dances, a 
Waltzing Chorus and Jig. 
Written by SAM'L N. 
M ITCHELL. 
Composed by H ENRY TUCKER. 
The music of this song is published Wm. A. POND & Co, 547 Broadway, 
N. Y. Price 40 cents. 
THE moon was brightly shining, and a 
million little stars 
Sent down their rays upon her as I 
saw her through the bars ; 
A 
merry crowd had gathered there and dancing was the feature, 
But the fairest flower in that bouquet was that charming little 
creature; 
She was dancing ' neath the arbor green, oh, she was just a 
clipper, 
And every time she tossed her foot she showed a 
silver slipper 
CHORUS. 
Oh, I 
can't forget the sweet and lovely pet, (Posture Dance.) 
The neatest ever seen, a 
perfect little queen, (
Posture Dance.) 
For underneath the arbor I 
watched that lively clipper, 
And now my thou2,-hts are centred on her little silver slipper. 
(Dance.) 
Her hair was all in ringlets, and a.wreath of roses fair 
Breathed out the sweetest fragrance on the calm midsummer air; 
A 
fascinating smile she had, her cheeks of ruby hue, 
And right above a 
Roman nose two eyes of violet blue; 
She was dancing :neath the arbor green, oh, she was just a 
clipper, 
And every time she tossed her foot she showed a ,silver slipper. 
Oh, I 
can't forget, etc. 
I 
watched her all the evening, while my poor and wretched heart 
Was longing, vainly longing in that dance to take a 
part; 
The fates they were against me for a 
fence stood just between 
Me and that laughing jolly crowd that between the bars were 
seen; 
She was dancing ' neath the arbor green, oh, she was just a 
clipper, 
And every time she tossed her foot she showed a 
silver . slipper. 
Oh. I 
can't forget, etc. 
As sung by Gus W ILLIAMS. 
I 
SHAN'T 
forget how queer I 
felt when first I 
fell in love, 
I 
had a 
most severe attack through squeezing a 
lady's glove. 
Her lovely hand was in it as I 
danced with her so gay, 
I 
thought myself in paradise—it's funny when you feel that 
way. 
cuonrs, 
I 
felt as tho' I'd tumbled into honey, and some one had hft. me 
all their money. 
The feeling's so peculiar and funny, it's funny when you feel 
that way. 
I 
took her down to supper, and sat down by her side, 
I 
helped her to the ices, and filled her glass with pride, 
In fac.,t paid such attention, that she viowed me with dismay, 
I 
moved my chair so close to hers, it's funny when you feel that 
way. 
I 
felt as tho', etc. 
We met again one afternoon, and as we were alone, 
I 
plucked up nerve to ask her if Soma day she'd be my own; 
She blushed and said, go see papa and ask him if I 
may, 
I 
danced the cancan round the room, it's funny when you feel 
that way. 
I 
felt as tho', etc. 
The old man said that we might wed and so he crowned our 
bliss, 
And I 
shall be a 
married man in about a 
month from this. 
It seems as though the time, somehow, would never pass away, 
I 
long to hear those wedding bells, it's funny when you feel 
that way.

A 
TINY, 
pretty boy was seen 
To climb his father's knee, 
And kiss his brawny cheek and say, 
"Now papa, you kiss me." 
The father pressed his darling 
And smoothed his silken hair, 
And Willie murmured with a 
sigh, 
"I wish mamma was here I" 
I 
wish mamma was here! 
I 
wish mamma was here!" 
And Willie murmured with a 
sigh, 
" 
I 
wish mamma was here !" 
A 
tear rolled down the father's cheek, 
He pressed his pining boy, 
For her he loved had gone before, 
And Willie's end was nigh; 
He bore him to his little cot, 
And dried the fallinff tear, 
And Willie murmured in his sleep, 
" 
I 
wish mamma was here !" 
" 
I 
wish mamma," etc. 
His darling pined that very night, 
Until the turn of tide, 
The angel death was near him then, 
At early dawn he died. 
The father cried in wild despair, 
" 
Oh ! live, my darling dear !" 
And Willie breathed his last fond sigh, 
" 
I 
know mamma is here V' 
"I wish mamma," eta.

started loan offices, hospitals, clubs, 
And finally swindled them all.—Cao.

T ARE A LESSON FROM ME. 
As sung by Gus W ILLIAMS. 
JOGGING along thro' life a 
rover, 
Over the world I've been ; 
'Alon7fst the wealthy and clever, never 
One contented I've seen. 
The poor declare with a 
fairer share 
Of wealth they'd never complain; 
But experience shows that appetite grows, 
And greed increases with gain. 
CHORUS. 
Some who care to be ever clever, 
Never their object will see, 
If content to be very merry, 
Take a 
lesson from me. 
Some who get rich in a 
hurry, worry, 
How their wealth to employ; 
Better, instead of sighing, trying 
How that wealth to enjoy. 
The possessor of true felicity 
I 
ne'er as yet have met, 
The nearest approach is the man who'd be 
Contented with what he could get. 
Some who care, etc. 
All is not gold that glitters—bitters 
Under the surface may lie, 
Which knowingly we'd not care for, therefore, 
Trust not too much to the eye. 
For much we see look lovely, that we 
Would find unpleasant to taste; 
What thus we get brings but regret, 
That trouble and time we should waste. 
Some who ewe, etc. 
Fort une fickle and strange is, changes 
Startle us every day; 
Should she deceive you, let her, better 
Never a 
word to say. 
For many will come with gifts to your home, 
If they fancy that you succeed, 
-Who would pass you by without a 
sigh, 
If they knew that you were in need. Some who care, etc. 
Where the boots pinch they who wear them, bear them, 
Only with a 
certainty know ; 
Lookers-on guess by the flinching, pinching; 
Limpina will frequently show. 
One half the world but little knows 
How the other half fare, 
And their indifference plainly shows 
How little about it they care. 
Some who care, etc. 
" WHEN THE ROSES SLEEP." 
W HEN the roses sleep, love, sleep at eventide; 
Shadows round me creep, love, hasten to my side. 
Smile on me again, love, let your arms entwine; 
On your lips I'll rain, love, kisses sweet as thine. 
Troubles come and go, love, what are they to me I 
Naught but joy I'll know, love, when thy face I 
see; 
Something I've to say, love, whisper in your ear; 
You are far away, love, will you come to hear I 
CHORUS. 
When the roses sleep, love, when the roses sleep; 
Something sweet I'll say, love, when the roses sleep; 
You are far away, love, softly to me creep; 
When the roses sleep, love, when the roses sleep. 
Roses are asleep, love, and each twinkling star, 
In the azure deep, love, wonders where you are; 
Why do you delay, love, hasten to my side; 
You'll not miss the way, love, I 
am here to guide, 
Time has swiftly flown, love, hours are growing.late; 
I 
am weary grown, love, still I 
will await; 
Something sweet I'll say, love, whisper in your ear; 
Roses are asleep, love, they will never hear.

The music of this song is punished by Wit= & GOULLAUD, 86 Tremont 
Street, Boston, Mass. Pike 40 cents. 
To a 
ball I 
cone night was incited, 
And being so fond of de dance, 
At de brospect I 
feld gwide delighted, 
Und eagerly jumped at de chance; 
Dere cos ladies dressed ub so stylish, 
Und as I 
had on a 
cite vest, 
I 
vas introduced to a 
lady, 
Whom I 
dought outrivalled do rest. 
SPOKEN.—Yes, und my friendt introduced me in dis sdyle: 
" 
Mr. Sharlie Unkelstein, allow me to introduce you to Miss 
Annie Conder." I 
sait: " Hobby to meet me, madam," und 
just as my friendt vas leaving us togedder, he said to me :— 
ClIORUS. 
You've got de belle of de ball, Sharlie, 
You've got de belle of de ball, Sharlie, 
You've got de belle of de ball, Sharlie, 
You've got de belle of de ball! 
De envy of all de fair dancers, 
She had such a 
fairy-like grace, 
But yust in de midst of de Landers, 
De lady turned black in de face; 
She gurgled, she gasped, und she hollered, 
Den took hold de tails of my coat, 
Dc top teeth of dis elegant lady, 
Had subbed down her beautiful droa.t. 
SPoKEN.—Vell, I 
vosn't mad because she bad a

Ho! not indeed. 
Besides, yust den anoder vone of my 
friends came ub, und said :— 
You've got do belle of de ball, etc. 
She retired, und ven she recovered, 
In a 
quadrille I 
next dook her hand, 
Ven a 
look in her eyes I 
discovered, 
Vich somehow, I 
could not understand; 
Her eyes vere as straight as a 
needle, 
Yen I 
gazed at dem fondly before, 
But now cone eye looked ub at de ceiling, 
Mad de oder looked down on de floor. 
SPOKEN.— Yes, does a 
fact, but I 
didn't vant.to say anyding, 
so I 
kept on dancing, yen all of a 
sudden her vig fell off, und 
• 
she cos bald-beaded, den her wax ear commenced to melt, und 
fell off; too. 
She looked as if she vos going to faint, so I 
cloak 
hold of her arm to lead her to a 
seat, von off came de left arm. 
Dot vos too much for me, so I 
run down stairs, got my hat und 
coat, und vent home, und venecer I 
meet any of my friends now 
dey alvays holler afder me, und say :— 
CHORUS. 
How is your belie of de ball, Sharlle, 
How is your belle of de ball, Sharliel 
Oh! wasn't she bald at de ball, Sharlie 
How is de hello of de ball'?

As you can plainly see, 
Though to " Reviews" I'm partial, 
No " rifle-butt" I'll be.

Although perhaps you'll smile, 
I

In military style.

To " sham fights" I'm devoted, 
And always " gain the day;"

For " merit" not for " pay."

But in a

I

shall " cut him out" 
In military style. 
Chorus.—llow do you like, &c. 
And when there's warfare raging, 
There often is, no doubt, 
With manners so engaging, 
I'll put the foe to rout; . 
I'll storm the trenches, scale the wallgi 
The enemy I'll " rile," 
And if I'm beat—I'll run away 
In military style.

Und de gals say dot I

Und can get avay too mit de boys, 
Dot is if dey're small und not very tall, 
Yen I

And how they dress, and all that thing, 
But for that I 
don't care ; 
The girls I 
love are Yankee girls; 
I 
see them every dby ; 
They're plain, I 
own, but then they have 
A 
nice and winning way. 
SPOKEN.—Yes, indeed. 
I 
needn't go out of the United States 
to find--
CHORUS.—Beautiful girls, beautiful girls, 
Saucy, teasing, pleasing. girls; 
I 
love one and all, both great and small, 
Beautiful, beautiful girls. 
It's nice, when it is winter time, 
To go upon the road 
In a 
nice sleigh, a 
pretty girl _ 
'Long side of you is stowed; 
And how the people they will look, 
And wonder who she is ; 
But you drive on, and never mind, 
Because it's not their " biz." 
SPOICEN.—It's the nicest thing in winter to have a 
pretty girl 
out sleighing. 
You stop at a 
hotel, and ask her what she will 
have to drink. 
She says ( very meekly), " Wine." " What 
kind— port or sherry '1" 
She says, " Champagne." 
Now, im-
agine treating to champagne and only a 
dollar in you pocket— 
and that always happens when you take out riding— 
Beautiful girls, etc. 
And when the summer comes around, 
To pie- riles you do go, 
And to enjoy yourself, while there, 
You ask along your beau. 
The day is fine, the music, too, 
And birds sing from each tree, 
And with a 
charming, nice young girl, 
How happy one must be! 
SPONEN.—At a 
pic-nic a 
man can always enjoy himself, if he 
has a 
pretty old with him. 
How nice it is to eat lunch with 
her that she has prepared with her delicate hands! 
How nice 
it is to get into a 
swing with her, and then to-wander off in the 
woods alone! 
You get on your knees, and tell her you will 
love her as long as life lasts, and ask her to be your wife. 
She 
consents. 
You then get up, and find a 
lot of mud and oyster-
shells all over your knees; and all that comes from making 
love to— 
Beautiful girls, etc.

But. now it has fallen from me,

And only the sorrow of others

Yet whenever I

Like the odor of brine from the ocean 
Comes the thought of other years : 
And forever, and forever, 
As long as the river flows, 
As long as the heart has passions, 
As long as life has woes, 
The moon and its broken reflection, 
And its shadows shall appear, 
As the symbol of love in heaven, 
And its wavering image here.

BANNER SONG. 
Written and sung by Gus WILmeats. 
M IME is a 
foreign country proudly resting from its strife, 
That is mighty on the land or on the sea ; 
Its sons are true to freedom, to justice and to right, 
And its record is a 
bright one, you'll agree ; 
sing of that old country, of the dear old Fatherland, 
That is precious to its sons o'er all the earth ; 
And its memory will grow dearer when they oft and proudly 
think, 
That to Frederick the Great, their land gave birth. 
Then here's the flag of Germany, 
It waves o'er good and true, 
Long may it float in peace, beside 
The Red, the White and Blue. 
Music—" Die Waeht dem Rhine." 
There is a 
little island that is known unto you all, 
And its banner I'll unfurl unto your gaze ; 
A 
bright and glorious emblem that you'll recognize at once, 
As the banner of its bright and better days ; 
The sunburst and the shamrock shall yet over them prevail, 
In that dear little isle across the sea, 
And no power of might or right shall dare that flag assail, 
For in time that little isle shall be set free. 
Then here's the flag of Ireland, 
And blessed be every fold, 
Her sons shall spread it to the breeze, 
As powerful as of old. 
Music—" The Harp that once through Tara's Hall." 
There is another country that I 
now will sing about, 
And I'm sure you'll co:ncide with what I 
say ; 
She has helped our nation nobly, when she needed help the 
most, 
But her glorious sons have now all passed away; 
Although beaten in the late war, she will be herself again, 
And show the world how great then she can be; 
No king or queen shall rule her, no matter what they say, 
For like America she will be free ! 
Then here's the National Standard, 
That now floats over France, 
Her Government is wide awake, 
And keen as any lance. 
Music.—" 
Marseillaise Hymn." 
(1) 
51 
BANNER SONG.—Continued. 
There's another little island that is struggling to be free, 
From the tyrants and oppressors who rule there ; 
She's an honor to the New World, and an ornament besides, 
But her troubles, they are more than she can bear; 
Her oppressors are a 
brutal set who do not recognize 
The law which God has given to us all, 
But murder and cold butchery they deal to every one, 
And that little isle for help does on us call. 
Then here's the flag of Cuba, 
flown trodden though she be, 
But Uncle Sam will soon send aid, 
And give her liberty. 
Music—" 
Cuba Shall be Free." 
There is a 
foreign country far beyond the rolling sea, 
With its castles and its power on every band ; 
It has great men in its councils, and of good men not a 
lack, 
And a 
language that we all can understand ; 
She's a 
great and mighty nation, though her faults we can't 
iattore, 
But the founder of our Union came from there ; 
So while we honor her great po wer and her noble sons of toil, 
Yet we trust our love of justice she will share. 
Then here's the flag of Eno-land, 
And while it long shall wave, 
May we ne er fail to love the land, 
That to us Shakespeare gave, 
Music.—" Gol Save the Queen." 
There is still another country that, is dear to every man, 
Who should love his brother ever as he ought ; 
It spreads the name of Liberty, where there is human life, 
"fis the flag that was with blow" of heroes bought ; 
Her doors are always open to the sufferin ,, and oppressed, 
Who may there in peace and plenty speed the right ; 
Her defenders are the patriots, who of .freedorn know the cost, 
For the banner they will ever gladly fight. 
Then here's our National Emblem, 
The Flag that Freedom won, 
And those beneath it dearly love 
The Land of Washington. 
Music—" The Star Spangled Balmer."

THE BUGABOO. 
As Sung by JERRY BARRINGTON. 
COME all ye tender-hearted boys, wherever you may be, 
And I'll tell you of the dangers upon the dark blue sea, 
Of the dangers and the hardships, my boys, that I went 
through,* 
When I 
shipped as cook and steward my boys, on board of the 
Bugaboo. 
*Repeat. 
The day when first I 
joined her she lay in James street canal: 
She was large and stout and beautiful—forget her shape I 
never 
shall : 
The captain wore a 
large straw hat, knee breeches and a 
body 
coat so blue,* 
Arrah, boys, he'd made a 
fine figurehead for to ornament the 
Bugaboo. 
*Repeat. 
We soon weighed anchor and set sail to plough the raging surf, 
We were bound for the bog of Allan to get a 
load of turf. 
We sailed until we passed the back of Richmond barracks so 
true,* 
When the gallant 84th fired a 
royal salute of bricks at the cap-
tain of the Bugaboo. 
*Repeat. 
We sailed three years when a 
storm arose, and the sea ran 
mountain high, 
The thunder rolled, the lightning flashed and lit the dark blue 
sky, 
So the second mate gave orders to lower the sails and clew,* 
While the captain down below was smoking in his bed—he set 
fire to the Bugaboo. 
*Repeat. 
When the captain found what he had done, he loud for help did 
shout, 
He called up through the chimney- top for the helmsman to 
come and put it out; 
But the helmsman was fast asleep, and to his post untrue,* 
And the fire burned so hard through the middle of the turf, 
they couldn't save the Bugaboo. 
*Repeat. 
When fifteen thousand miles from land in latitude fifty-four, 
The fire it burned so hard one night, that it couldn't burn any-
more ; 
So the captain he gave orders to lower the boats and save the 
crew,* 
While 1,000 rods of turf and 50,000 men were smothered in the 
Bugaboo. 
*Repeat

" 
THE SPADE." 
As sung by Gus W ILLIAMS. 
Give me the Spade and the man who can use it ; 
A 
fig for your lord, and his soft silken hands, 
Let the man who has strength never stoop to abuse it, 
Give back to the giver—the land, boys, the land. 
There's no bank like the Earth to deposit your labor, 
The more you deposit the more you shall have ; 
If there's more than you want you can give to your neigh-
- 
bor, 
And your name shall be dear to the true and the brave. 
CHORUS. 
Give me the Spade, &e. 
Give me the Spade—the American's glory— 
That fashions the field from the bleak barren moor, 
Let us speak of its praise in ballad and story, 
While ' tis brightened with labor, not tarnished with 
gore. 
It was not the Sword that won our best battles, 
Create 1 
our Commerce, extended our Trade, 
Gave food for our wives, our children, our cattle, 
But the Queen of all weapons— the Spade, boys, the 
Spade. 
Give me the Spade, &c. 
Give me the Spade, there's a 
magic about it, 
That turns the black soil into bright shining gold, 
What would our fathers have done. boys, without, 
When this land lay all bare and the north wind blew 
cold. 
Where the tall forests stood, and the wild beasts were yell-
i 
ng, 
Where out stout-hearted ancestors shrank back afraid— 
Now the cornstack is raised and have cleared a 
dwelling, 
Then Hurrah for our true friend, the Spade, boys, the 
Spade. 
Give me the Spade, &e.

I SHOULD LIKE TO. 
As sung with great applause by Gus WILLikms. 
ALL kinds of fun and frolic too, I 
meet with night and day, 
And yet from all of it I 
have to tear myself away ; 
The girls again I 
always meet, are something sweet I 
vow, 
Oh, couldn't I 
enjoy myself if I 
were single now. 
SPOKES.—Yes, now I'm married and settle I, I 
come across no 
end of chances for real enjoyment. 
When I 
was single things 
were as dull as ditch water. 
It's cruel to be tantalized in this 
manner now a 
fellow's running in double harness, and when I 
see my old single members going out for a 
regular break down, 
that's the time when I 
feel as though— 
CHORUS. 
I 
should like to, I 
should like to, and sorry I 
am to say shan't, 
But the fact is, yes, the fact is, I'm married alas, and I 
can't. 
Some friends of mine they called on me, ' tis just a 
week ago, 
And with them on a 
trip at once, they said that I 
must go; 
Of course they all seemed greatly vexed, and savage quite to find 
That I 
could not their frolic share, but had to stay behind. 
SPOKEN.—They said, " This won't do, old fellow, you must 
come, for we're going to have a 
genuine flare-up and no mis-
take." " I'm very sorry, my dear boys," was my gloomy re-
ply, " but it really can't be managed—she's in the next room— 
but of course I 
should wish you thoroughly to understand, 
that "— 
I 
should like to, etc. 
One night last week I 
overtook a 
lady tall and fair, 
Oh ! hazel were her beaming eyes, and golden was her hair, 
This fair one I 
a 
little while in doubt and silence eyed, 
But soon we both together got, and walked on side by side. 
SPOKEN.—Yes, this dear little creature and I 
soon got on 
very good terms, and at last she said—" Won't you take me to 
the theatre ?" " Eh ? Ah," said 1—" Prn grieved to observe 
that you're asking an impossibility, I am utterly powerless to 
manage it, though I 
really can assure you that "— 
I 
should like to, etc. 
But now I 
must conclude my song and toddle off with speed, 
Or otherwise I 
feel convinced there'll be a 
row indeed, 
For Mary Jane, my vixen wife, is waiting close at hand, 
And rows with her, I 
do declare, are more than I 
can stand. 
SPOKEN.—Yes, ladies, I 
must now bid you adieu; I 
trust you 
will not ask me to sing again, as my wife is so awfully jealous, 
although, as far as I'm personally concerned, you know— 
CHORIJS 
I 
should like to, I 
should like to, and sorry I 
am to say shan't 
But the fact, oh, the fact is, I 
hear my wife coming and can't.

BEAUTIFUL LOVE. 
As sung by Gus W ILLIAMS. 
LOVE, love, oh, what is love 1 
love, ' tis that makes man feel' so 
peculiar: 
()Move, who does not love a 
Maud, a Matilda, a 
Jane or a 
Julia 'I 
Love it is, and love alone, that makes the world go round and 
round, 
Love is certain to be known, where a 
woman's to be found. 
When one has the first attack it's like raspberry jam, running 
down ones back. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, love, beautiful love, love it is that makes a 
man feel so peen 
liar. 
Oh, love, beautiful love, a 
man's but a 
fool when he falls in love. 
Oh, love, NN1-ien you're in love, to presents, to parties and picnics 
you treat her, 
011, love, just squeeze her glove, and you feel just as tit:4' you'd 
like to eat her ; 
But the best of loves must part—then an end comes to ycur 
bliss, 
You press the dear one to your heart and take from her the 
parting kiss. 
You bid her good-bye at the door with anothdir sly kiss and two 
or three more. 
Oh, love, etc.. 
Oh love, when you're in love every half hour you'd go to court 
her. 
But oh, love, if she won't love, you talk about drowning yourself 
in cold water; 
If it's all right she'll giggle and say, please ask father if I 
may, 
Then you feel so jolly and gay, and tease her till she names the 
day, 
You'll serenade her when she's abed and her dad drops th)wer-
pots on your head. 
Oh love, etc. 
Oh love, when you've your love out, all the money you have 
you must ladle, 
Servants, dresses, parties, and balls, perhaps each year a 
cherub 
to lay in the cradle. 
When the honeymoon is past then your eyes are not so blind, 
Your dream was far too good to last and your face grows long 
to find, 
Your looked- for happiness begins with a mother-in-law . and 
beautiful twins. 
Oh love, eta.

FUNNY OLD GAL. 
As sung by Everybody.. 
I'm a 
funny old gal and I 
take things cool, 
The people all say that I'm an old fool, 
But they may all laugh and chaff at my pate, 
I'm a 
fuLny old gal from old Ca'lina State. 
CHORUS. 
Then all of you sing for this funny old gal, 
All of you sing for this funny old gal, 
All of you sing and don't you be too late, 
For this funny old gal from South Ca'lina State.' 
T'other day, while walking in the street, 
Some naughty little boy say, " how's your poor feet ?" 
I 
hit him with my cane, and then we had a 
tussle, 
And I 
found all the sawdust coming out of my bustle. 
Then all of you sing, etc. 
! 
I've been married many a 
time, 
Of husbands I 
have had just nine; 
I 
always done my best for my husbands, don't you see, 
But none of them ever done much for me. 
Then all of you sing, etc.
