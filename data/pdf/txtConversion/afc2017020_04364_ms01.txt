Back of House: Kitchen Workers in Central Ohio
Archie Green Fellows Project, 2017 
Occupational Folklife Project || American Folklife Center 
Interviewee: Jimmy Barouxis [Owner/”Donut Clerk,”  Buckeye Donuts] 
Yanni Agalos [Long-time Donut Baker, Buckeye Donuts] 
Interviewer: Jess Lamar Reece Holler 
Date of Interview: Monday, June 4th, 2018 
Location: Buckeye Donuts -- High Street, Columbus, Ohio 
SOUND QUALITY NOTE: The interview takes place in the dining room at Buckeye Donuts, ﬁrst, at the 
side counter near the front door; and later, after my battery dies, at the front counter facing out on High Street; as 
such, our recording picks up Buckeye Donuts’ music, and sounds of donut and food preparation, coﬀee-making and 
dishes from the back kitchen and behind-the-counter front of house spaces. The mics also experienced 
interference, and made some loud squawking sounds, during the early part of the interview; 
it was suggested by Jimmy that perhaps the sound eﬀect also came from the brakes of a COTA bus that stops 
outside the donut shop. //  Additionally, this interview runs over multiple recordings, both due to the single-ﬁle 
length limit of my Tascam DR-100MKII, and because our original location did not have a working outlet, which 
ultimately ran out the unit’s battery pack. We relocate to the other side of the store, under the music speaker, for the 
last 30 minutes of the interview. 
INTERVIEW NOTE: Jimmy’s interview is one of two interviews conducted at Buckeye Donuts; Jimmy’s 
brother Pete, who started working at the donut shop more recently, was interviewed the day before, and had 
originally arranged to be interviewed for the project. Both brothers were interested in being interviewed for the 
project and to share their diﬀerent takes on life and labor at this iconic Columbus donut shop.  // Part-way 
through this interview, Jimmy pulls in long-time Buckeye Donuts donut baker Yanni Agalos, and we both 
interview him -- Jimmy translates my English into Greek, and translates Yanni’s responses from Greek. Yanni and 
Jimmy converse about back-of-house matters and donut production order numbers at several points after this 
mini-interview, as well.

his parents and grandparents had immigrated to the U.S. in the 1970s; “and they spoke only 
Greek in the household.”

Grandfather got a loan from one of the owners of the Blue Danube restaurant, to buy a Jolly 
Pirate donut (Greek-owned) franchise along High Street; 00:06:00 -- history of the Jolly 
Pirate donut empire in Columbus; the Greek owner of the donut line wanted to take on 
immigrant franchisees; so Jimmy’s father was oﬀered a franchise, along with a business 
partner, Mr. George Sauter. Jimmy’s father helped, as well, as a seventeen year-old.

I had skipped out on,” especially in terms of math
●
00:26:00 -- Discussion of his father’s real estate // property management business in 
Clintonville and the early 1980’s culture in Clintonville; “... it looked like a Lynyrd Skynyrd 
concert in 1979 … working class, blue-collar, Harleys … and you had some librarians; you 
didn’t have yuppies … it was pre-hipsters.” 
00:28:40 -- Returning to Buckeye Donuts // Enjoying the Autonomy of Running Shifts 
●
Jimmy says he was frequently asked when or if he’d come back to the shop (he worked here 
when he was thirteen and fourteen, sweeping and mopping during the summers); he went on, 
in high school, to work at Carfagna’s and at White Castle; but, when he was nineteen, after 
his ﬁrst summer in college, his dad asked him to come in and cover a shift at the shop. 
Narrative about this call to work (00:30:00)
●
Jimmy showed up at 6am to hire a new employee who didn’t cover; and he learned, from his 
dad, to cover the register; getting to know and recognizing alot of the regulars, and his 
customers from White Castle; and controlling the radio (playing WMNI) and playing CD’s;

●
Kept his job at White Castle; and worked at Buckeye Donuts a couple days a week

“As time went on … I just kinda got sucked into it. My role just steadily increased; and my 
parents just needed me a little more. They needed somebody dependable … somebody … 
who cared”
●
Jimmy discusses his autonomy running shifts at the restaurant; “I got pretty popular” -- being 
twenty-one and running the restaurant; “it was a one-person show; one person could run the 
whole store; even on night shift, when we would ﬁnish up donuts … graveyard shift gave me 
even more freedom; and I just met all kinds of cool people.” [Short pause.]
●
00:34:00 -- Jimmy describes his local fame and popularity and the good feeling of being 
recognized at parties and connected on the OSU campus as the “donut guy”; going to Larry’s 
bar; “I live with my parents; I don’t live on campus” -- being a known person at Buckeye 
Donuts helped Jimmy feel connected to 20-somethings on campus; “... when I worked at the 
donut shop, that kind of elevated my self-image … I felt like I was a part of campus life …”
00:37:00 -- An Old Business in a Changing World: Jimmy Updates Buckeye Donuts 
●
00:37:00 -- Jimmy describes bagel culture and other mom-and-pop eateries and locations in 
the Buckeye Donuts stretch of high street; “This campus, compared to how it was, I’m going 
to tell you right now … it’s depressing. Alot of the character is gone. Nothing against chain 
restaurants, but you can get any of these chain restaurants in some suburb in Indiana … 90% 
of the businesses on this strip are all chains.” Jimmy contrasts this to the high volume of 
mom-and-pop businesses the ﬁlled these blocks in the 1990s, when he started back at 
Buckeye Donuts.
●
00:39:00 -- Jimmy discusses his parents’ commitment to keeping the same old business 
model since the 1960s; and discusses the material culture of the old menu board (“we had 
people ordering donuts we haven’t had in years”) and the necessity of going with the times 
and updating the culture and service
●
00:42:21 -- Becoming more involved in the business as his parents began “aging out”; Jimmy 
was on-ﬁre with alot of ideas (delivery; installing a kitchen), and his dad was tired and not 
super interested; Jimmy’s concern was bringing the business back to its former glory, after a 
slump in the 1990s. 
●
00:43:50 -- Jimmy discusses the urgency of deciding that Buckeye Donuts needed to oﬀer 
food; people were going to Tim Horton’s; or to the Wendy’s that opened next door; or the 
bagel shop down the street with a loyalty program
●
00:45:00 -- Jimmy wanted to make more money, and got frustrated with his parents leaving 
him to run the shop by himself while his parents went to Greece two summers in a row; 
“things got tough here, business was bad … I had the ideas, but I didn’t have the resources …” 
Jimmy left, and went to join his cousin on the Isle of Crete, and started thinking about 
transforming the restaurant

and catering, and growing the business
●
00:50:00 -- Shop culture in the 1990s; discussion of competition with early-2000’s upstart 
super-processed donut chains like Krispy Kreme; hipsters and international students keeping 
Buckeye Donuts in business throughout the 1990s
●
00:53:00 -- Jimmy’s shop culture changes: new speakers, uniforms (Buckeye Donuts t-shirts); 
adding additional new products (grandma’s baklava); “that saved us … because, the way things 
were going, we were not doing that well … we almost sold the place. We were doing so poorly 
for a couple of years.”
●
00:57:00 -- Changes in clientele with the new changes and food culture; “meatheads” and 
“jocks” and transforming the culture from hipster culture to building business; making the 
job more diﬃcult for the staﬀ, who hadn’t signed up to be cooks, originally; “I want to work 
here back then!” Job was much easier before the cooking started; “it was a little bit of a status 
thing, to get a job here.”
00:58:50 -- Building Out a Kitchen: Teaching the Staff to Cook // Wages + Tips 
●
Jimmy describes the early menu, and teaching staﬀ (who had been accustomed only to 
running front-of-house) to begin to cook during their shifts; raises and shift meals; employee 
complaints about tips going down when they started cooking food
●
00:59:40 -- discussion of the tips system -vs.- salaried employees at Buckeye Donuts today; 
workings of the tip pool; even the deliver driver but tips into the pool (except, some didn’t)
●
Buckeye Donuts pays above minimum wage; Jimmy estimates employees make an additional 
30-50% of wages in cash take-home tips
●
01:02:00 -- Longevity culture in employees; Yanni Agalos, the baker, who has been making

make donuts correctly [in translation, via Jimmy]
●
Yanni reﬂects on being the best baker at Buckeye Donuts  [in translation, via Jimmy]

it!” Narrative about how Yanni would hang up bad donuts Jimmy made, when he started 
making donuts; “we use humiliation, humor, just … all kinds of thing. And we talk about it. 
We gossip … there’s always funny things going on.”

have an overnight production schedule, to produce the smell of fresh-baked donuts for 
people coming in in the morning
●
01:35:00 -- Jimmy discusses new donut grease without trans-fats (hydrogenated fats), which 
reduces the shelf-life of a donut drastically; and makes a 24-hour-old donut very stale; “after 
about sixteen hours, it’s done … we’re using the same techniques; and higher-end ingredients 
… we ﬁlter our grease now more, to compensate … so now, it’s been a game-changer.” So now 
Buckeye Donuts does two bakes.

●
“Leading by example” and supervising the “whole operation … typically, that’s my role, to 
make sure all functions of the operations are running smoothly; but I can also get down and 
dirty … and they know that. My bakers know that. So, they can’t mess with me. And if I 
didn’t know how to make donuts, they could walk all over me … and play games … and hold 
donut production hostage, which, believe it or not, has happened! … I do all the positions, I 
can do all the positions, I work side-by-side with my employees, and I try to lead by example 
… if I came in here with my sunglasses, hair slicked back …”
●
01:55:00 -- Jimmy discusses wages, and high turnover in cooks and front-counter staﬀ; 
diﬃculty of providing an experience of consistency and a stable culture for customers; 
“always having to train people”; Jimmy shares that paying decent wages, “above minimum 
wage” helps to take care of employees so that they stick around. At Buckeye Donuts, back-
of-house staﬀ starts out at $9.50, plus tips; so he says that most people clear $12.50 or $13 per 
hour.
●
On minimum wage: “If we just hired minimum wage people … I mean, people deserve to buy 
some groceries and put gas in your car. I mean, you can’t survive on minimum wage; I mean, 
I’ve done the math … let’s say it’s $8.50. I think, it’s in the eights … after taxes, these people 
can’t live on $6.25 an hour. I’ve done the math … 40 … times $6.25 … is terrible. You can’t live 
on $250 a week. Come on. People have a right to buy some frickin’ groceries. And pay for 
stuﬀ.”

●
Jimmy discusses wages as a way to cultivate good employees, cut investments in training, and 
not creating “crap jobs”; Jimmy discusses that he’s kept his cooks for over 10 years -- “I pay 
them a stupid wage. I pay one $20 an hour … why I pay them $20 an hour? Where am I 
gonna replace them? Where am I gonna replace ten years of experience … ten years of 
intimate knowledge of the operation?” Discussion of payment and living wages; discussion of 
General Manager salary
●
Reﬂection on how paying higher wages “probably has helped my bottom line.”

●
Jimmy discusses building oﬀ of the investments his parents’ and grandfather put into the 
company
●
Jimmy shares about “contributing a little bit of history … to this shopping mall of a campus 
that this has become … we are, I feel, one of the last vestiges of small business on campus”; 
providing an all-night safe spot for students and campus community members; and that he 
has a plan to be here for a long time; and his plan to involve his sons in the family business; 
“I am laying down the groundwork for them … one of them … the other one, I need him to 
take over the real estate!”

Celebrity Encounters
[Interview starts again in a diﬀerent location in the store, right under a speaker; battery charge was not available 
at the previous locations and the batteries ran out]
●
02:07:00 -- Jimmy reﬂects on the fact that the back-of-house work isn’t always fun; but 
bringing fresh donuts out to customers and seeing their reactions is deﬁnitely worth it
●
“... but, to get to that point, it’s a process, sometimes: you’re mixing the dough; you’re 
cutting it … sometimes, you’re by yourself back there, under ﬂuorescent lights … it can get 
lonely back there … but, it’s fun. A labor of love … and there’s a little bit of ﬁghting … it’s not 
always harmonious; the bakers, themselves, are all competitive, and they want to be the best 
… there’s a little bit of dysfunction; but, as long as the product turns out in the end, that’s 
what matters. And there might be a story behind that donut, of what had to happen to get it. 
But, as long as they get it, they don’t have to know everything. They don’t need to know all 
the back-of-the-house business …” [Brief recording pause]
●
00:05:00 -- Jimmy discusses his gluten-sensitivity diagnosis, and not being able to eat donuts 
without digestive and other issues; cutting out gluten in 2012 and going through “donut 
withdrawal” and “dreams of longing for donuts.” Changes in his ability to serve as a taste-
tester and do quality control in the shop. Depression about not being able to participate in 
the donut culture. Discussion of how diﬃcult it would be to produce gluten-free donuts at 
Buckeye Donuts; it’s about cross-contamination in the kitchen and not so much about 
ﬁnding a recipe.

collaboration across the kitchen
●
00:13:20 -- Celebrity encounters in Buckeye Donuts lore: Woody Hayes, George

food”)
●
00:29:37 -- Participation in Breakfast with Nick blogger Nick Decker’s breakfast tours around 
Columbus every two weeks; becoming a cultural destination; considering Buckeye Donuts’ 
“revival” and “comeback,” since the 1990s
●
“We’ve come back; and the people of Columbus like us enough to come back, on a regular 
basis; and we love doing what we’re doing; so we’re just gonna keep rolling the dough and 
making the doughnuts and doing what we do best.”
