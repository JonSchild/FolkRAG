two boys were in airplane--Rodney and Tommie- and they crashed in the water and they
had this big box in the airplane and it was made out of steel and nobody knew what was
in it and that was this top secret of the air force and this boy he he saw the whole thing
and then he went and told the police but the police didn't believe him but the other man
another man saw it too and he saw it and than the police got the phone call that if anybody
told them about the airplane crash don't believe it because the two men were supposed
to be dead and this took took place in Greece and most everybody talked talked Greece
and nobody understood English and then the two boys they crashed and they only had
their shorts on and they had to go around through the whole book with no clothes on
just their shorts and they lost each other and one stole fruit from everybody's house and
the other one he went out on to everybody's clothes line and took off the clothes and he
wrapped a sheet around hisself to look like a Arab because the ship was coming in with
a lot of visitors and there was a lot of Arabs on them and the Arabs saw them and they
thought it was one of them and they started talking in a different kind of language and he
understood them and they ran away so another part there was this lady and this man they
were uh sheep keepers you know and they saw the box when it landed and they took it
to the house but they couldn't open it they did everything to try to open it but they couldn't
open it and so then on the ship another ship came in the next day and this girl come on
her name was Electra and she had this acid she was showing the people in Greece how
to use acid and the guy stole the bottle and he opened the metal thing and there was all
this big tablets in there and his wife and him took it but then they dumped the box over in

the river because the uh investigators were coming to check on the box cause it was top
secret and nobody knew
2
what it was and so then the wife she threw it overboard with the tablets in it and everybody
next day was swimming and this girl she came out she was in shock she almost drowned
because they was all fish all over the river they were all floating and in the box there was
these tablets that were supposed to be uh scientific things made for fish and like they were
working on this uh program for tablets that could produce people and they were uh first
dealing in all fish and that's uh supposed to be kept top secret and the whole river were
flooded with fish. (ques.) Yeah and that's the end. (ques.) And the two boys were found
at the end and they were supposed to be they were uh reported dead because nobody
knew about them they didn't uh want anbody to see them because they were supposed to
be dead and then at the end (ques.) Because it was top secret and what they were doing
and nobody had heard from them and nobody could talk English hardly and so nobody
understood them and so then at the end these uh investigators came and they found them
then they went back to America (ques.) uh huh yeah (ques.) Yes the uh goatkeeper's wife

kept on popping in and out this is really a movie that's how come its so hard to explain.
(ques.) Yeah and the boat that came to Greece from America there was this girl her name
was Electra and she was always uh the investigator she was always interfering because
she liked one of them and they had to get her out of there because she was too nosy
and she had the acid and so then that goatkeeper took the acid because she was giving
demonstrations on you know the uses of acid (ques.) no (ques.) She showed the different
ways that acid worked.becanse they never had you know they never seen it (ques.) Like
she had metal and she drew a a design and then she just went like that and it fell right
out it was like a demonstration and then the goatkeepers was there and he she went over
to the other investigator and they went for uh to get something to eat and then he ran off
with the bottle he went to his house (ques.) Because like when you see a movie you can
tell about it but when you have to read it I never even heard of the movie but you kn ow
they said it was a movie and on the back it had all pictures of it but you, would expect it
like to be shorter because it's too long to read when you could see it in a picture. (ques)
Yeah you know like you want to know what happened you can just see it on television
so you wouldn't want to read it (ques.) no (ques.) no uh Electra and the goatherd and his
wife (ques.) Uh she liked the men she liked all the guys in there these investigators but
she liked this main special one (queS.) a regular American (ques.) uh she was a girl who
always liked men (ques.) Yeah she was pretty real pretty and she was nice (ques.) No
she went away on a boat and uh she met these guys who talked Italian and they were
saying what a pretty girl she was in Italian and then she goes to them in Italian that she
understood Italian very well and then she went off she left the kid (ques.) I don't know
something happened they had a fight I think they were trying to get rid of her because she
was so nosy around there and then she got mad and then she left she took the boat back

Speaker: when everybody saw the fish then they knew cause they saw the box too the box
was down on like on a ledge and then everybody knew so it wasn't top secret anymore.
(ques.) I know but then maybe like if they knew what was in the box they would try it on
other things (ques.) I don't know you know like the government like they would try it on
cats or something (ques.) Yeah but like it was supposed to be secret but they didn't know
where the box was because when the plane crashed they had a parachute for everything
and they couldn't find the box. (ques.) The box, because everybody was going around
looking for the box (ques.) It was when the fish came out that was how come the name the
day the fish come out (ques.) Yeah it was good i don't know cause (ques.) Yeah I read it
real fast in two days (ques).
End M32 A(1)
Speaker: Yeah I like to read like teenage stories and I dont like mysteries (ques.) because
I'd rather see it on televiabn than to read it (ques.) cause on television when I can get up
at any part that's scary but in the book I'll know that I have to keep on reading it (ques.)
They're all right but I don't like you know the ones with the mystery part and everything
(ques.) uh huh it is to me cause it keeps you in suspense (ques.) I don't know (ques.) I
don't know (ques.) goat well him and his wife they had a little baby and he wouldn't eat
anything because he couldn't get the box open and he would he'd go out and get drunk
and then come back and try to get the box open again and then he'd get so mad he'd go
to bed without eating and everything and his wife wouldn't pay any attention to him and he
wouldn't let her go out because people would get suspicius and he kept her in the house
(ques.) No I mean he was well like he didn't want nobody else to have you know to know
about it because he wanted it all to himself because he didn't know what was in it because

(ques.) Yeah because like there was them other all other goatherders around and like if
anybody else knew they would want to know what it was too and if anybody
else got it open you know he'd probably want to be popular around that way and that's why
he wanted it all to himself (ques.) At first she was trying to you know she just stood by and
she tried to help him but then he didn't want her help because he was getting madder and
madder because he couldn't get the box open (ques.) It didn't say (ques.) No
