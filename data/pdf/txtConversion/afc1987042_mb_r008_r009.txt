Cambodian family that ah, make me feel comfortable, rather live in another city that's ah, no

B:  Hul.
H:  Yes, H-U-L.  
B:  When you, when you first came here in 1981 ah, where did you start to work?  
H:  Mm.  My first job is working as a Lab Assistant at Lowell Community Health Center of 
Lowell General Hospital.  So now I worked there for about a few months.  I found many 
Cambodian has a difficult life.  To adopt an America life, American Life, you know.   That's why 
I need to quit my job and expand my service to all area in the City of Lowell, in the State Public 
Welfare Department of Welfare in Lowell, Immigr, U.S. Immigration in Boston, Employment 
Center of Indochinese Refugee Foundation, and also I was elected to be a President of 
Cambodian Community.  Start up, organize Cambodian Community to work, help people to have
a better life over here.  
 
B:  Help them to find work and a place to live.  
H:  Yes.  Start open a school for them to learn English secondary language.  Get a job training for
them to be ready to be on their own way to support their own family.  To be off quickly from the 
welfare system.  And also have them to feel comfortable in the new medical system,  because 
many a Cambodian came to the United States they are very unfamiliar with the new system.  
They feel uncomfortable about blood test, they believe that this is all blood test.  They believe 
that this is amount of blood that they have in their own life, you know.  And they don't believe 
that ah, the red blood cell, or the white blood cell may reduce more and more in the body.  They 
just believe that it is amount of blood that I have in my body.  Somebody take it away, what 
happen to me?  I may die, you know, quickly, or have a short life, you know.  Um, this one of the
trouble that I need to go around with my people.  Explain to them how happen, how the body 
reproduce the cell to support the health, you know.  
B:  What are some of the traditional medical practices that(--)
H:  Ah, mostly because if Cambodian in Southeast Asia we are a poor country.  Ah, only in the 
big city they use western style, you know, treatment.  But beside the big city ah, most people 
they use a traditional treat, traditional treatment.  Use a herb, leaf of the tree, root of a tree, and 
some time they use coining, oil over the muscle when they have a pain like a muscle pain, or 
they feel comfortable in some area [words unclear] coin it, you know.  You use a coin and wrap 
it, you know.
B:  Coin?
H:  Yes.  To coin it.  And some (--)
B:  And that takes away the pain.  Does a special person have to do that, or can everybody?
H:  Yes.  Yeah, anybody can do that, you know, because it's very simple.  And also they use like, 
like a burning.  You use a burning medicine to burn on a spot, you know.  To kill a bad, like ah, I 
don't know how it's called, because I'm too young to understand that too, you know.  They 
believe that some of the cause of pain it's because of nerve damage, you know.  So they just burn 
it.  And kill the nerve and damage the nerve.  So people don't feel any pain anymore.  And 
sometime they use a needle.  It's like acupuncture, to treat, you know.
B:  Are there, are there still specialists who do that in the community, or?
H:  Yes, they do.  They need to be a special person who has experience to do that.  But, 
unfortunately they don't have school to go for it.  Our people continue to learn from generation to
another generation.  
B:  Right.  The traditional way.  
H:  Yeah, when, when they need a medicine they go to younger, you know, and pick up all under 
the different kind of herb, you know.  Come and mix it around, you know.
B:  It's kind of hard to find here though.  
H:  Yeah.  Yes, and no where to find it.  But they do have a place ah, that imports some material 
from Asia in Chinatown.  
B:  In Boston?
H:  In Boston.
B:  Who, who are the people, who are the specialists who live in Lowell, who practice traditional
medicine?
H:  I didn't see anybody in Lowell who do that, because Lowell is a pretty new community.  
B:  Oh, yeah.
H:  Just started.  I believe pretty soon we'll have it, you know,  because people still believe in 
that.  
B:  Do they also use western medicine too?  
H:  Yes.
B:  Both?
H:  Yes, they use western medicine too, you know.  But sometime in a case like ah, some 
diseases are ah, a western cannot find it.  Yeah, cannot find it.  Like abnormal period, you know.  
Ah, in a western they believe ah, everybody healthy.  They just a normal to have period.  But in 
Asia there are special medicine to make people having good menstrual period.  But in western 
they believe that emotional feeling of the people may change the date of menstrual period, you 
know.  But it has some kind of complication ah, a medical that we cannot say which one is right, 
which one is wrong,  because sometime it works, sometime doesn't.  
B:  When you first moved to Lowell (H:  Yes) how large was the Cambodian Community?
H:  Is about four hundred.
B:  People, or families?
H:  Yes, four hundred people.  Four hundred people.
B:  And now it's?
H:  Right now it's about 14,000 of them, because the City of Lowell is a good place for 
opportunity to get a job, ah low crime, and also City of Lowell has a good network in helping 
organizing, helping refugees, new coming immigrants you know.  Like International Institute is 
a, has office to help people to get like a lot of service.  
B:  When uh, when you first came here where did you live?
H:  I live in ah, Market Mill, subsidizing housing.
B:  Oh, where is that?
H:  In ah, Market Street in downtown Lowell.  
B:  Is that, is that a place where lots of Asians lived at one time?  
H:  No.  I'm the only one Cambodian live over there.  
B:  Oh,  Was there a neighborhood where most Cambodians live?  
H:  Yes.  Mostly our neighborhood, Cambodian family live in the Acre.  Acre is a, is a bad 
neighborhood, but people came here has no money to support themselves.  Depend 100% on 
welfare system, but is very little to, for them to support a big family.  Especially when just came 
here they need many things.  They need to buy winter cloths, need to pay rent, utilities.  They 
didn't have anything left.  No.  They come with bare hand.  No, that's why they need to force 
themselves to live in bad neighborhood for cheap price. 
B:  Were there problems living there with other groups in the Acre?
H:  Because a Cambodian family, they escape from Cambodia.  They have one goal in his mind 
is finding peace.  Even though they live in a pretty bad neighborhood, something happen to 
them.  They just keep quiet, you know.  Keep away from them, you know.  
B:  Yeah.
H:  They don't want to start any war anymore, because they spend enough time in the war.  In 
Cambodia, kill their own people, kill their own friend, their own family.  So before they came to 
United States they make, set up a goal that I want to be peace.  No more wars.  Stop war.  That's 
why even though they get some problem they feel like it's normal, (B:  umhm) you know.
B:  So there were some problems sometimes with the others neighbors.  (H:  Yes)  
Non-Cambodians who (--)
H:  Yes, like a break into the house.  (B:  Oh yeah)  Some robbery but very few, you know.  
Break the windshield of the car, (B:  Oh yeah) you know.  A little bit like discrimination in the 
job, you know, but it's not a real big.  It just feel like ah, you don't speak good English, you 
know.  So you work in a hard place, you know, noisy place.  Ah, but you're happy to do it if you 
like ah, it's not just happen to a Cambodian Community.  It happened to all the nation.  All 
nationality who just came to this country, you know.  One look down on another as, you know.  
After many years of people feel like familiar with Cambodian.  We do a good job.  We have a lot 
of Cambodian to be a technician, engineer, lawyer, [unclear] and that's problem.  It would be 
disappear.  That's what I believe in, you know.  
B:  But education's important?
H:  Yeah, education is important.  They want children to get education.  So future, their children 
would be Cambodian-American.  So the problem would be disappear, you know.
B:  Do your sons speak ah, English and Cambodian?
H:  Yes, they do speak English, Cambodian.  
B:  Umhm.  (H:  Yeah)  And they ah (--)
H:  They, they (--)
B:  Can they write Cambodian?
H:  No, they cannot write Cambodia, they speak Cambodia pretty good, and little write English.  
B:  Umhm.  [Unclear]
H:  And they has a tendency to adapt American life more than a Cambodian culture, you know.
B:  But they will grow up thinking that they're Americans first, Cambodian second?
H:  Yeah, that's right.  A Cambodian become a second [unclear].  They seem like they just want 
to know about what Cambodian is, but the way that they want to go is American life, you know.  
Sometimes they have argument with me.  Like ah, why you do that?  Why don't you do that?  
You know.  Why I do it, because I used to do it, you know.  I'm a little bit old.  It's hard for me to 
change in just a few years from the way I used to live for many years.  But my children found 
that a new ways better.  Why don't you do it, you know.  Easy and fast, you know.
B:  Do they like American food?
H:  Yes, they do.  They like ah, hamburger, cheeseburger, you know.
B:  Fried Chicken?
H:  Yes, chicken.  [a child's voice is heard in background saying, "banana"] fried chicken, you 
know.  [laugh]
B:  [Comment unclear] 
H:  [Chuckles] Yes.  Even in a television program, movie, they like American movie more than 
Asian movie.  
B:  Oh, yeah?
H:  Yeah.
B:  So do you eat traditional Cambodian food at home, or do you eat both?  
H:  Both.  (B:  Both?)  Both.  We don't drink water any more.  You know, we drink Coke, 
Pepsi-Cola, you know, juice, milk, and (--)
B:  What traditions or customs would you, do you want to keep?  
H:  What are my, what I want?
B:  Important values, or customs?
H:  After I live here for a few years I found out that United States, American life has ah, more 
good things, but also has bad thing too.  Like ah, a good thing like ah, your children has a 
freedom to speak, to say.  So it's one of the best ways to let the children to get more research for 
a better way of their living.  But the bad thing like a drug, you know.  A drug like ah, children 
start to have like ah, six year old emotional very quickly.  And sometime to much a freedom may
lead them to the wrong way.  If they do go the right way, that's great, but if they go to wrong 
way, it's difficult to bring it back, you know, especially even to go to school.  They stay school 
for many years.  They go out with American friend.  And if a neighborhood is bad, some school 
has a lot of bad friend, smoking, cocaine, you know, drug, alcohol.  They may also go along with
them quickly too, you know.  That's why I want them to learn about what is a good in America.  
And also keep what is good in our culture.  Like ah, be polite to the parent, to friend, you know.  
And also work hard.  Don't be a burden to the government, city, state, or to friend or parents.  No,
be on their own way and do the best you can in your life, for peace and freedom.  And know how
to use your own freedom, for profit to themself and to community.  
B:  Respect your parents?
H:  Yes, I respect parents, you know, because, because I'm a Buddhist.   What a Buddhist ah, 
teach us is be good in themselves and to the outside.  What mean the outside, are parents, wife, 
children, community and all friend around, you know, not just good for themself.  Is important 
like ah, you make a lot of money, you're not just enjoy for yourself.  You need to share the 
money for the poor, for your neighborhood, for the city.  Like a pay tax for the state of 
government.  For the better community to your neighborhood.  Support the growth of your 
neighborhood.  To friend like ah, who need it.  Who has a lack of ability to support themselves, 
you know.  
B:  When you first came here was the Temple?  (H:  No temple at all)  Was there a Temple?  No?
H:  It will be a big problem to a Cambodian Community.  After I elect to be a president 
Cambodian community, I work very hard to get a education, like ah, English secondary to help 
my people to speak English.  Getting a job in Social Service, but it seem got like a one hand 
working.  The people survive, but they still feel like they need one more thing.  Like a man to 
have two hand to work together.  So after I do this story I'm thinking, and a lot interview with 
people, I found out that beside working, getting money, buy food, house to live in, they need a 
spirit.  Have to support the body, you know.  Get the food, money and clothes to support the need
of the body.  They need the spirit to support their own mind.  That's why I organized a 
Cambodian Buddhist Community since March 23, March 13, 1983.  To bring a people, 
especially old people who cannot adapt American life.  And they still think about their own way 
of living.  They feel alone to go outside.  They feel afraid to go outside.  They cannot learn 
English anymore, because his a mind is wear out.  No, they spend sixty year in Cambodia, speak 
Cambodia, learn, eat, living and enjoy with a Cambodian living style.  And this country is a big 
different.  Language, you know a culture and the way people thinking, emotional feeling, 
physical and emotional feeling. So they afraid to go along with them.  You know, and they feel, I 
cannot do it!  So I need to help that people first and establish a Buddhist Community.  Bring 
them together.  Checking a Buddhist song and cook Cambodian food, you know, dress a 
Cambodian dress, you know.  And they feel very comfortable.  They feel, they feel like this is the
way I want it.  
B:  Was there a Monk here?
H:  Not yet.
B:  At that time?
H:  I just rented a space now for fifty dollars a month.  I just rent a space for fifty dollars a 
month.  Is very poor apartment.  We met every Sunday morning from 9:00 to 1:00 o'clock.  
Sometime people stay until 5:00.  They feel like, I don't want to leave here.  So because of, of the
people need it.  People feel comfortable to do it.  And especially it's a one way to bring people 
together.  Support the Cambodian discipline.  It's a grow very fast.  People more and more come 
to attend.  Until we have not enough space to serve them.  We go to Institute, International 
Institute, I don't know, to afford the help.  A big hall for a special celebration.  So very busy, you 
know, sometime we don't have enough room for the people too, because how many Cambodian 
keep move in Lowell?  More and more and more, because job openings more and more.  
Community has set up a network to serve people better and better, you know.  And I myself very 
good about organization, go around, collect the money.  And just after three years only we collect
ah, money up to $100,000.  And we put just one of the building in North Chelmsford.  And that's 
at 21 Quigley Avenue, and it costs $250,000.  And we spend the money to fix it,  about $50,000.  
Right now community keep booming up.  More money has donate to a Buddhist Community.  
We buy another land plus one beautiful house.  Together property costs right now half million 
dollar.  And so three years only start from the rock, the bottom, from $50.00 space of renting up 
to half million dollars property.  
B:  And it's on Quigley?
H:  Yes, on 21 Quigley Avenue (B:  where's that?) in North Chelmsford.
B:  [Unclear]  (H:  Yeah)  Oh yeah!
H:  Right now it become one of the biggest Cambodian Buddhist Temple outside of Cambodia, 
in the world.  
B:  Are there Cambodians who live around the Temple?  [Unclear]
H:  Ah, a few family.  
B:  A few.
H:  A few family.  But it's not to far from City of Lowell.  It's about five minute driving.  
B:  Is that North Chelmsford?  
H:  Yes.  But it's close, you know?  
B:  Off of Middlesex?
H:  Yes.  A very quiet neighborhood.  And a really nice place, you know.
B:  And the people in the neighborhood has accepted the [unclear]?
H:  Yeah we, we do have a little bit problem, because in North Chelmsford it's a, a nice 
neighborhood.  It's a rich neighborhood.  And people has live in a family house.  And it's a 
non-Cambodian resident over there.  So when we step into the ah, with thousand, thousand of 
people coming every week, ah, people start to feel surprise.  What are these people coming from?
What are they doing?  What kind of religion is they hold, is they believe in?  You know?  And it's
kind, some kind of ah interruptions, argument going ah, for the first couple months.  But we try 
very hard to go along with the people.  Open the door, welcome people, to explain what we are 
doing.  What we are from.  Feel free to answer all the questions what they want to know.  Open 
the door, you know.  Prepare food, you know, and accept them.  Very warmly, pretty soon they 
will become our friend.  
B:  Have they?
H:  Yeah.  
B:  They're coming to the Temple, and?
H:  Yes, they come to visit the Temple.  They want to study what, what is Buddhist for.  And they
found it's ah, it's another, another kind of good world, you know.
B:  Has the Temple worked with other, say Christian
H:  Yes, we do.
B:  Religion, Ministers and (--)
H:  Yes, we do.  We do have some.  A lot activity with the Christian and the Catholic.  Like we 
have a meeting, and a World Religion Day celebration in the City of Lowell.  We come together. 
Sit down among a hundred religion in the city, in the greater Lowell area, Lawrence and 
Chelmsford.  And each people shared idea  about how each religion has their own way to bring a 
peace to the world.  And we are very happy, enjoy, be friendly.  And we treat each other very 
well, you know.
B:  Okay.  When did you start your store?  
H:  Yes.
B:  When did that happen?  
H:  Ah, I start my store February 15, 1987.
B:  You have a good memory for dates.
H:  Yes.  [laugh]
B:  February 15?
H:  Yes.
B:  1987?
H:  Yes.  
B:  It's growing.
H:  Yeah, it's boom up very well.  
B:  That's not even one year.
H:  Yeah.  I doing very well, yeah.  I'm appreciate to American system.  And I'm appreciate to 
American ancestor that has set up a good system for American and for non-American is able to 
live very easily.  It's a lot easy when to contribute and they willing to accept it.  Example, like 
credit system.
B:  Yeah, to get started in business.
H:  Yes.  ah, when I start my business I don't have so much money to start it.  I use Creative 
Financing.  I go to the book, study.  I go out, make another phone call, find good deal, you 
know?  And finally I make it, you know?  In my country I cannot do it.  I cannot do it, absolutely
cannot do it.  But over here.
B:  Why couldn't you do it in your country?  
H:  Ah, because of ah, they spend cash.  Everything cash, no credit.  (M:  Uh huh)  So it's a 
difficult for us to do it by cash.  You know, but in America if you do have good credit, establish 
good credit, and know how to prepare and take care of good credit,  you may do it now.  Even 
though we have no money, you may do it.  
B:  Are they still some Cambodians living in Lowell who ah, don't like to use credit?  [Unclear]
H:  Most of them, they do not family have credit.  That's why it's my next goal after I resign from
Cambodian Community and a Buddhist Community, I plan to help my people.  To help Asian 
Community, Laos Community, to understand, to know about credit.  About real estate.  How to 
get their own house with no money, or little money, and how to prepare their own credit.  How to
be, enjoy an American credit system.  Not just survive, how to succeed in American.
B:  Are there many Cambodians now who own their own houses?  Who are buying houses?
H:  Yes.  Some families they, they do pretty successful and ah, in house.  They own like a four or 
five house.  But it's about 2%.  And 5% they own one house.  And another 93%, they're still 
renting.  (B:  Renting)  They're renting now.  They do have some money, but difficult to, to find a
house.  To deal with a real estate company and also with a bank, because they don't know how to 
do it.  They feel like it, they need so much experience to do it.  That's why I study a lot.  I needed
to go talk with a lot of people in order to go out, step my feet into bank financing, real estate 
business, so I can help thousand of people to get a better house.  Spend a house (--)  Smartly 
spend their own money.  
B:  What areas of the city has the Cambodian community settled in?
Still just the Acre, or moving out?
H:  No, they're moving all around in a great city here.  (B:  unclear)  In a greater Lowell area.
B:  So they're not just, Cambodian Community does not just stay in one space?
H:  No, they live separately.  No.  
B:  Do you think that sometimes they feel a little isolated or [unclear]?
H:  Ah, they do feel a little bit isolated, but because of they too many of friend around and they 
like okay, you know.  
B:  This sides almost gone, but I wanted to ask about ah, going back to some of the older 
traditions and customs.
H:  Yes.
B:  What things are still practiced from the older culture?  Language, religion, food?
H:  The language, religion, custom, food and a family connection.  
B:  The family's important?  
H:  Connection, yeah.  They want a family live close together, not just away.  Like our children 
get married, they stay with the family.  And the children get a job they want to stay pretty close 
to area where they have their own family, if a family connection.  
B:  Which family, if a couple gets married, do they live with the, the man's family or, the 
woman's family?
H:  Right now it's a little bit changed.  Before they usually with the, the girl parent.  
B:  Girl's parents.
H:  Right now the one is better they go.  
B:  Oh, I see.  So it's changed.  
H:  A little bit changed.  It depend on job, you know and opportunity for them to grow better. 
                         SIDE ONE ENDS
SIDE TWO BEGINS
B:  It's probably, I think Larry Flynn said that you keep the community's kind of archives of 
video tapes in the store of peoples weddings and other ceremonies.
H:  No I don't.  
B:  You don't.
H:  I don't, no.  I don't.  Before I do have, but I do not keep any more.  [laugh]

reach to all the family.  It's important a family who die long time ago and live in a hell, because 
they commit a lot of sins they live in a hell.  So they live in starvation, no food and a very bad 
place.  So it's a time for them to join family over here, and get good food, you know.  And it's 
time for ancestor who live in heaven to come and join and see each other in earth.  Even though 
we cannot speak, or see each other ah, but they believe that they come together the same day.

ask.  They don't care what kind of job.  Even noisy, dirty, pay cheap, they don't care as long as 
they can make money and live on their own way.  They like to do it.  Sometime because of the 
job, it's a little bit money, they work two or three job.  And they work hard even on a weekend!  
After they save monies they buy new cars.  They happy with a new car.  They buy a house and 
what they go through and the difficulty in a job, it's finish, it's gone.  
B:  So has that changed?

N:  $9.00, $12.00 for hour.  But they do still have a Cambodian who old, cannot speak English, 
cannot go to school anymore.  They still on a low pay job, you know.  But, they still enjoy it.  It's
better than staying on welfare, or get like $400 a month.  They may work for,  get $400 a week, 
and proud to go out and buy and spend the money.

control of Russia.
B:  It's communist.
N:  It's Communist Russia.  So he got a training to be an import and export agent.  I don't know

to me."
B:  Oh!
N:  Don't mention I'm your brother.  
B:  Yeah.  
N:  So it some kind of tough world, you know, because of what he say is a lot of meaning.  He 
says mean a lot.  "I'm fine.  Don't send a letter to me.  Don't say I'm your brother."  So, why I 
cannot say we are brother?  
B:  He doesn't want them, (--)
N:  Don't send a letter to see him.
B:  He doesn't want them to know he has a brother in the United States.
N:  In United States, no.  I don't know how, how he's feeling?
B:  It wouldn't be good for him.  It might be not good for him.  
N:  Yeah.
B:  They might not trust him if they (--)
N:  Yeah.
B:  Do you have other relatives in Cambodia, or in the camps?  
N:  No.  Not at all.  
B:  They're all out.
N:  Yeah, not at all.
B:  That's great.
N:  And in his letter he say, he say, "When you [receive?] my picture from the United States, just 
only the tear can mention how we feel.  No word, no letter.  No discussing.  [long pause]
B:  Do you get to see your brother in Chicago?
N:  Yes, I visit him once a year.  One a year.  My brother he want to escape to United States too, 
but he has a big family.  Him afraid of his wife getting raped, the children getting lost in dark 
forest, you know.  
B:  Oh.
N:  And afraid that he lost a family on the way to escape.  You know, it very dangerous.  Take, to 
risk life to do it.  So he has a big family can't do it.  So he decide to stay.  Freedom, or die to 
make it.  
B:  How did you get here?  Was it um, difficult?  
N:  Ah, yeah very difficult.  We need to walk through ah, thirty mile on a highway, pass through 
a lot of communist control, control post.  They check, where are we going, check I.D.  you know.
Ah, where you from?  Where you going?  We lie them, we go to see parent, or brother and sister 
in another town.  And we had to walk another thirty mile in a dark jungle.  And need to spend 
only twenty, only twelve hour from sunset to sunrise, make sure the sunrise we get to the camp.  
If not the sunrise, when they saw us, the patrol post saw us, he shoot you to death.  A woman got 
raped. Children got lost when a parent die, and no where to go.  Die by like a wild animal, no 
food, no water.  It's a mine, mine jungle.  If a lot of people die in ah, unable to escape.
B:  Into the camp?
N:  Yeah, we need to pass through three communist line.  Vietnam Communist, Khmer Rouge 
Communist line, it's a military line, you know.  The first one is a Vietnam Communist, the 
second one is Khmer Rouge Line, the third one is a Khmer Liberation Line, and the fourth one is 
Thailand Military Line.  And it's very difficult.  Each line has a lot of mine, mine ground, you 
know.  (B:  Right)  A lot of military patrol.  I saw a woman got raped, you know.  Killing, 
robbery and nobody care.  And the end of the line is United Nation Camp.
B:  Once you got there, did you put your name on a waiting list to (--)
N:  Yes.
B:  You get a sponsor and (--)
N:  Yes.  I need too ah, find people who can sponsor me to another country in the third world, 
because in a refugee camp it's just a temporary place to live.  And the situation is not safe.  So 
that's why I'm lucky to get out.  Dr. Glen Cooper is volunteer to be ah, doctor at refugee camp.  
And I work with him as assistant, ah, medical aide.  And we become very close friend.  And he 
start to fill out application for me.  He talk with U.S. Embassy in Bangkok.  He talk to a 
representative in Boston.  And he say, "I got a friend, Peter Kelly's Attorney do all the paper 
work, you know."  Sign the paper work to support me.  So finally I get it, you know. 
B:  Do you see him sometimes?  
N:  Yeah, right now (--)
B:  When you go into Boston?
N:  Yeah, I didn't see him any more.  About years, ah, Dr. Glen Cooper right now he got a 
promotion to be a Director of Medical Research in ah, Europe.  In London.  English, England.  
And ah Doc., and Attorney Peter Kelly he got another job in a computer company in Tokyo, 
Japan.  So what I see him just by phone.  When I need his advice, I call him.  He's like my 
parent.  He's financial support and information support.  That's how I can grow very quickly in 
my life in the United States.    
B:  Were there other places people could go, from the camps?  Or just in the United States.  
N:  No (B:  other countries?) they go to a different country in the world.
B:  With France?
N:  Yeah, France, Canada, Australia, some Japan, and German, Germany and Switzerland, 
England and all the world country, you know, who want to accept refugee.  
B:  The families try to stay together.  
N:  Yes.  After the first family get over there they try to sponsor another families coming.  You 
know.  
B:  So you, there are still people coming to Lowell from the camps?
N:  I believe right now is very few.  I mean came to the country.  Came to the United States, very
few, because of political change.  
B:  Political change when?
N:  Political change, I don't know.  I have no idea what happened.  
B:  But you will sponsor, you can sponsor?
N:  I already sponsor 75 family to come to the City of Lowell.  Right now I do not do any more, 
because the goal I came to the United State for freedom and start a new life.  When I start to 
think so much about outside, my family exhaust.  We like a time in a family.  We like a budget in 
a family.  (B:  Right)  Sometime we run out of money, and we need to work hard to support a 
family.  We cannot just go out and spend time with the people, with the people, and do so many 
things and forget about family, you know.  That's why I need to go back to start my own 
business, but I still think ah, about community.  But half of community and half of my family.  
B:  Are you studying to be a citizen?  Do you have (--)
N:  Yes, yes.  I plan to be a citizen pretty soon.  I'm already fill out application in U.S. 
Immigration in Boston.  I wait for the call to take a test and swear in the court.  I believe I make 
it, no problem.  I'm very proud to be American.  
B:  Then you can vote.  
N:  Yes, I vote.  Freedom and enjoy the freedom as in America. 
B:  Good.  Both of your sons were born in Cambodia, or Thailand?  
N:  Yeah, is born in Thailand.  
B:  In Thailand.
N:  Thailand Refugee Camp.  But they are pretty small when they came here.  One just about a 
couple of month, and one about a year and a half, yeah.  But they don't recognize what they go 
through.  They only see and they only know United State of America.  Beside that they don't 
know.  There is no feeling.  When I show them a picture of refugee camp they just look and, then
I, "is this what we go through."  [Laughs]  They seem like they don't believe it.  
B:  But you will tell them these stories though.
N:  Yes, I have to.
