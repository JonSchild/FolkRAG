Dear Carmen Teresa:
 
In response to your letter of May 31 to our program director, Less Lomax Hawes,
 
concerning Victor Lequerique's impending trip to Philadelphia and ?
Iashinpton,
 
I ;
just wanted to let you know that I have contacted
d him and made an initial
 
appointment for the morning
; of ?
4ednesday, July 11.  At that point, he and I
 
will set an agenda of r
ueetings with various staff m m
iber
.s of the Lndamnent and
 
of ether federal agencies working in the area of folk arts.

Dear Annie,
 
I an sorry to have to tell
. you that the Folk Arts panel met June 6-8 here
 
in Washington and did not recommend vour request for $20,307 for a folk
 
arts coordinator position and a festival of traditional Cuananian arts.
 
I a
rr enclosing a xerox of a letter Dan Sheehy sent you April 19 asking for
 
additional information, but we never heard back.  The panel felt that they
 
could r
iot act favorably on this application in view of the fact that we
 
were not sure of the identity of the folk arts coordinator, the expertise of
 
the person
_ most recently known to have been in that position
,  is questionable,
 
and the me-mbership of the su?ervisory panel
. is unclear as well.
 
I a
re enclosing a copy of our 1985/86 application form in case you should
 
want to reapply in the fall.  Our next deadline is October 1
, with a
 
preliminary optional letter of intent deadline of August 15.  Again I am
 
sorry about this.  You will vet a formal letter of rejection after the
 
August Council meeting*, but in view of the lon; distance that separates us
 
and the fact that you might want to reapply in October, I wanted to let you
 
know about the -
panel recommendation right away.
 
Yours truly,

Hear Xargo,
 
I apolo{
:
.ize for takin- so long to write this letter, but we have only just
 
confirmed the arrangements for the National Heritage Fellowship award
 
ceremony this fall.  The final date is September 7
, a Friday evening frog
.
.
 
7
:30 t
o 10:30; the place is the Ford '
I
lieatre in Washington, P.C.  There are
 
seventeen nominees; so far, all are plannin` to attend, though last year a
 
few fell ill at the last minute.  I think you will find it a very moving
 
occasion and we are so  pleased that you are willing at least to consider
 
lending your presence to t
he evening.  By the way, it seems possible that in
 
spite of the rigors of the catttpaign, Vice-President and Mrs. Bush may also
 
join us.
 
As I told you in our hurried conversation at the Council meeting, Theo 1
3ikel
 
hosted our first award ceremony, followed the second year by Pete Seeger.
 
We think we will keep to th e wa y those  experienced gentlemen did it, all
 
t
he awardees coming on stage together for a very brief presentation by
 
Frank Hodsoll
., each individual receiving their award certificate with just
 
a sentence of identification by Frank; then everyone going back stare and
 
returning singly for a five minute presentation of their own especial art
 
form.  You would be hostess for this part of the program; we would, of course,
 
send you a basic script which you could edit to your own style.  Each musician
 
will play or sing one or perhaps two tunes; each crafts worker will have the
 
opportunity to make a few remarks while slides of the particular craft are
 
projected on a rear-projection device.  The spontaneous remarks from our
 
craftsworkers have often been the high points of the eveninY.
 
I do believe that, if your schedule still allows you to join us, you would
 
bring an especial warmth and sensitivity to the program.  You would certainly
 
be ouch appreciated and Frank joins me in an earnest hope that you'll be able
 
to be with us.  I shall enclose some proSran materials from early ceremonies
 
together with the biographies of this year's heritage nominees that appeared
 
in the February Council pages.  If there is any further information that I
 
would provide please call me at 202/6€2-5
"449, and I
'll be happy to get it to
 
you at once.  We will, of course, be happy to make appropriate travel and
 
housing arrangements for you when you let us .
now your schedule and whether
 
-
• 2 -
 
or not you will be a
ide to come after all!  By t
he way, we plan to rehearse
 
off and on all day lone September 7
, but you would need only to drop by,
 
perhaps, to get the `
s
lay of the land."  l
.e are hoping for live radio coverage
 
i
f aot t
.v. as well.
 
Again, please let me kuow i
f there is anything else I can tell or send along.
 
And I do so hope you can comet
 it ought to be a night to remember.

Subject:  Fellows Attendance at panel Meetings
 
Folk Arts is and has always been pleased to have Fellows attend its panel
 
meetings as their busy schedules allow.  Renceforth we will also be
 
pleased to forward a copy of our panel agendas to the Fellowship Office,
 
but in my opinion at least your June memorandum i
s responding to a non-
existent problem.  The Fellows are mid--career professionals, they have
 
very nice manners, they catch on quickly, and for the life of r
i
te I can't
 
see what's wrong with t
heir corning and going in and out of panel meetings
 
as they choose.  Do we really need another set of memos to tell us which
 
interns will cone to which meetings?

Dear Suzi,
 
Thank you so much for the terrific map.  It is sure to be a great help, and,
 
as you know, I
'm a bit of a map freak anyway, so it was especially welcome.
 
I enclose in small return a copy of the M  cketat's chef d
'oeuvre on their
 
basketry.  It seems to me a nice example of what a small group can do
 
essentially for themselves with just a small amount of outside dollars and
 
a little help in locating collections, finding a printer and the like.
 
If you already have a copy, please pass this along with my compliments to
 
some
-body
  nice.  I
'll be seeing you soon on the t5,
all.  It's hot as the hinges 
here; I hope the weather will be responsive to whatever Artic chill you can
 
bring with you.

Subject., Bill Establishing the Square Vance as our 'National Dance"
 
The attached bill has been around a long time and has never gotten r
each
 
attention.  This year, however, it has somehow passed the Senate, and the
 
House Committee on the Post Office and Civil Service, which handles these
 
honorific matters, is planning
, bearings for
. .
tune 28.  I thought you might
 
want at least to be forewarned in case the views of the "ndowment are
 
solicited, so I am attaching not only a cony of the Bill itself but a
 
resolution passed by the Board of the Rational Council on the Traditional
 
Arts and a research memorandum prepared by Jerry Parsons, Research Librarian
 
at the Archive of Polk Culture at the Library of Congress, in response to a
 
request from the mouse Committee.  It is extremely interesting reading.
 
I have also spoken on this ratter to Nigel Redden who concurs with me that
 
this is an extrevely inappropriate piece of legislation, and he
. will alert
 
Don Moore °s organization as well as other parts of the dance world.  Perhaps
 
you yourself might want to testify, but I gust point out that the hearing
 
coincides u
r
ith the annual convention of the American Square Dance Association
 
in haltimore, so the meeting will undoubtedly be €
 t
icked with organized square
 
dancers, a
. pretty obstreporous group.  I a
rt really afraid, though
., that the
 
voice of reason may be Orowned out unless some steps are taken to point out
 
to the Congress that the American square dance, worthy though it is, is not
 
really on the sapse level of national s
;,mholism as the f
lan and the Great
 
Seal and the National Anthem.

Dear Dr. Wkstra,
 
I was sorry to receive your letter of May 9 and to realize that there had
 
been confusion over your nomination for a National Heritage fellowship.
 
I enclose a copy of the folk Arts program brochure that explains the procedures
 
involved in t
ine Heritage part of our program.  You will notice that we ask
 
for nominations for individual artists rather than applications from individual
 
artists (
the more usual procedure in other types of grants).  Since this is
 
the case, we confine our correspondence to the individual who first nominated
 
the artist -- is your case, Dr. John t
wallstein of the Office of Instructional
 
Services in the Department of Education.  Many people who have been nominated
 
for Heritage fellowships doeuot fnow that their names have been put forward,
 
and do not ever discover i
t unless they receive a final award.
 
I also enclose for your review a copy of the letter I sent your nominator,
 
Dr. Wallstein, last October 4
.  You will see that we will not make any official
 
announcement of our panel's recommendations for t
his year=s fellowships until
 
next month; the exact date, I believe, is June 14.  1 normally would return
 
your books to Dr. Wallstein at that time, but since they appear to have been
 
sent by you, I shall return them to you under separate cover immediately, and
 
will send a carbon of this letter to Dr. Wallstein so that he knows what has
 
happened.
 
I regret the confusion.  I am afraid it way have occurred because you or
 
Dr. :
dallstein heard about the Heritage awards directly rather than seeing a
 
copy of our guidelines.  I have marked a few passages in t
he enclosed
, brochure
 
that I t
rope will explain what we are trying to do a bit more clearly.  You may
 
well feel that we
. should have sent these guidelines out more widely or that we
 
should move Twre quickly, but I assure you that we have a tiny staff and that
 
we handle a mountain of work.  We are doin€, and have done what we can to insure
 
that all nominations sent us receive an impartial and thorough review and that
 
supporting materials are handled safely and as promptly as our review procedures
 
allow.
 
Yours sincerely,

Bear Dirk,
 
:
-
?hat a nix-ur.  By now, I guess you realize that the re,ection letter you
 
got from my office referred to the tattooing proposal„ not t
he Palauan
 
project.  Dejection letters bften go out before grant letters, since the
 
grant packets take longer to put together than the strai^ht-forward "sorry,
 
we ,
just can't do it" type of coimminication.  I suppose I should have said
 
which g
;raut I was referring; to, but it never occurred to me that you wouldn't
 
check the grant number with your files, and then I had already phoned Bill
 
Lockhart and told him the S
tory board grant was almost completely approved.
 
I guess people generally just don't trust the federal government, and there
 
are days when
. I don't myself.
 
Anyway, we'll try to get the leaky old boat back into the water and patched
 
up for next spring.  I
'm glad Tina isn't too disappointed.  Now, I have
 
talked with Bill Lockhart and I did mention to hint the possibility of your
 
withdrawing the grant so that we could award it over a
r
;ain next year (
fiscal
 
1585) and thereby use for some otter worthy caus es the 198G monies we had
 
set aside for the Palauaa project.  However, after-nulling this i
dea aver
 
with Rose Morgan, Polk arts' able Grants officer, we've decided this would
 
gust be too complicated a
t.€ involve not only you but us in too much work.
 
Therefore, we will simply leave things as they are.  You keep the grant
 
packet until you are ready to start the project, and we'll hold the dollars
 
in reserve for you.  Legally, all grant funds are to be requested for a
 
30 day period and should be spent within that time.  Therefore, don't
 
request any funds from us until a month before the project is to begin and
 
you will need the cash in hand.  My reco mendation is that you a
,ck the
 
President of the University to let you sit down with t
hat grant packet and
 
look through all the information it contains.  That should clear up much of
 
your problems.  If you're still in doubt, write again or call (
person to person
 
collect) either Rose Morgan or me at 202/632-5449.  In the meantime, I will use
 
your current letter as a request for an extension of the grant period until one
 
y
,ear from the date originally on the grant packet, and you will eventually get
 
a formal approval of that time extension from the Grants Office.
 
I
'm so glad to get the whole business straightened out at last and hope that
 
we will have many more times to work together on many more exciting ideas.

Do keep in touch.  One of these days I shall wend my way back to Guam and
 
Palau as well and greet you in person instead of across all the miles.

Dear Carmen:
 
From the limited information given in t
he letter from Anibal Rodriguez,
 
director of the "Cuiro Orchestra of Puerto Pico," it seems to me that they
 
nay have a good project that would fit our program guidelines.
 
Their next step would be to send s
ue a letter or application (
I am enclosing
 
the proper forr:s) with very complete details as to the classes they are
 
planning -- teachers, how many students, how many classes, type of publicity
 
for the classes, class fees (if any), content of t
he classes, and so forth.
 
None of this was in their letter.  Also, there was no mention of the budget.
 
As you are aware, we give matching; grants in which we fund up to but not more
 
than 30% of the total project costs.
 
our next deadline date is October 1
.  I
f they send it in earlier, it would
 
very :
such be to their advantage, as I would have more time to talk over
 
their plans with them.  If you or they would life to contact me by telephone,
 
r
ay number is 202/682-5443.  '
lector Vega, one of our current panelists, might
 
also be of assistance to them.  I am certain he would be glad to help.
 
It was s

Dear Panel,
 
Welcome to Washingtont  Maybe it will have stopped raining by the time you
 
copse.
 
t
'e offer our traditional apology for the quantity of work that faces you and
 
the weight of the panel_
 books . There are an uuuaual number of applications,
 
and we will have to -
move a bit cautiously , since we are reacting the end of
 
our fiscal resources for F7 84.  '
Phis
  may prolong discussions, and
. I do hope
 
that all or most of you can
. stay until at least three o
'clock Saturday
 
afternoon.
 
You will find sot
-u- extra reading under the Five Year Plan tab.  T
i;a full
 
document -
-- another whole book full -
-- will be available to you at the par
cel
 
meeting; you are rou
u receiving only those pages that have to do with the
 
Polk Arta Program exclusively.  The genesis of this oeuvre is almost too
 
complicated for me to r
eam
 tuber in detail, oich less explain ; suffice it for
 
now that this represents a s
tretch of whet we are doing and what we intend
 
to do in the future . It is a sketch, and we will be requested to revise
 
and re-order and mess it ail up annually . So get out your red pencils.
 
We will devote as muea time as you feel we need to revising and -
-• as they
 
any in the Government .
-
-- fine-tuning this prose.  You may find a few
 
surprising things in it; there are quite a few that surprised me too.  t
.ut
 
do take it seriously; the Plan is now an integral part of our budget process
 
as you will see when I show you r
ay request for 1986 program funds which I
 
will have available for you at the Vanel-meeting.
 
Also, I feel as though I should keep reminding you to keep accurate and
 
complete records of all your expenditures relating to these meetings for
 
income tam purposes . At the end of each year . the Frdowmer
at Tails to you
 
and to the IRS, a copy of norm 199 showing the total amount paid to you
 
for the year.  T
lh
 is amount includes t
roth honorariuz and per die;t. so if you
 
keep good records as you go, it will probably save o lot of t
lr!e and
 
frustration
. later.
 
►a have one other extra special inducement for attending our June meeting:
 
an evening off1  No kidding -- Friday night is all yours,  "
Wednesday night
 
we i
�i11 look at media samples and Thursday we have: an elegant evening
, of
 
looking at completed films ve'va funded.  I think you'll enjoy it.
 
See you in June.  Till then, let's be careful out there.
 
Yours,
 
.

is pretty liberal and allows us to do thins (
like give loans) that we've
 
never even tried.  But should you think of a vast improvement or even a
 
small one, could you do so within the week and let ne know?  I need to

Subject:
 1976 TULACU Grant
 
As I r
uentioned to you over the telephone, I perused the records of this ,rant,
 
now located in the archives of the Library of Congress, to find out what I
 
could as to whether or not the grantee lived up to the conditions of the
 
project description in the original application and whether or not t
he :
coney
 
was spent properly.
 
As you may see froia the attached copy of t
he basic application form, the
 
main, and only, tangible product required by the terms of the grant are four
 
papier mache models illustrating four historic periods in the demographic
 
evolution of Boyle reigtits, a neighborhood in East Los Angeles.  Coincidentally,
 
I was living in Los Angeles at the tiric and I remember hearing of public
 
activities connected with the display of the models and actually seeing-
 
photographs of the models on display.  Bess Hawes a
lso remembers seeing
 
Pictures of the models that the protect director, Alicia Gonzalez, s
howed
 
her when Alicia was under contract t
o the Smithsonian Institution and Bess
 
was her supervisor.
 
In short, from all I can tell, the project was completed.  The grant folder
 
did not contain many details concerning financial expenditures, but nothing
 
appeared to be unreasonable in this regard, and in tact, an amendment of
 
approx Uiately $3,000 was given toward the project.  I would expect that for
 
them to have been awarded an amendment, the r
olk Arts panel must have approved
 
of the progress made up to that point in time.
 
I hope this is of some help to you, Jack.  I
f you need still more information,
 
we can certainly pursue the matter further.

Thru:

Subject:  UTAH BALLET FOLKLORICO COMPANY
 
Judging from the information available in the application to Expansion Arts
 
from the Utah Ballet Folklorico Company, it seems doubtful that the application
 
as it stands would be funded by our program.  The interest of most folkloric
 
ballet companies is to take folk material and mold it into a new choreographed
 
work for formal stage presentation, and as such they line up closer to the
 
purpose of the Dance Program than to that of Folk Arts.
 
Me other problem is that their request is for a broad range of ongoing
 
activities, such as Expansion Arts is good at responding to.
 (Also, the
 
Dance Program, I believe, gives seasonal support for professional troupes.)
 
Folk Arts, on the other hand, funds projects - for example a workshop series
 
in which an authentic traditional dance master would teach some of his/her
 
skills to those interested in learning.
 
I do not mean to say that the Utah Ballet Folklorico Company cate orically
 
would not qualify for funding from Folk Arts.  If they were to come to us
 
with a well thought-out proposal bringing to a good traditional Mexican
 
dance-master (
I know of a good candidate in northern California whom we have
 
funded on a couple of occasions), they might s
tand a very good chance of
 
funding from our program.  On the other hand, they may not want to do that!
 
I
f they would like to contact me, I would be most happy to talk over their
 
needs and plans with them.

The art of Mexican Folkloric dance i
s one of the most stimulating
 
and vibrating i
n the world.  Every girl should develop beauty g

to achieve these qualities.  Dances f
rom all the various states of
 
Mexico will be taught.
 
Dancing .i
s not only physically stimulating, but i
t also creates an i
nterest i

a better understanding of other people and their culture.

To Whom it May Concern,
 
I wish to convey to those concerned, our support for the Utah Ballet
 
Folklorico.
 This colorful and talented dance troupe has contributed to
 
the cultural enrichment of this community for many years.
 It is also
 
recognized by this organization for it's teaching and educational abilities
 
in recent past, through the free classes offerred the community via
 
our community center.
 
Their most notable attribute however, is an enduring dedication by the
 
original cast to consistently avail themselves for performances at great
 
personal cost and sacrifice.
 This past summer alone, the croup performed
 
at four different fund-raising events sponsored or co-sponsored by this
 
organization.
 These activities were a May 5th celebration at the Salt
 
Palace; the Annual Utah Hispanic Festival in our center during the month of
 
June; Feria de las Flores also held here this past August; and more recently
 
here at the center the September 16th festivities.
 
The Utah Ballet Folklorico is a milestone of sorts for initiating the
 
interest and involvement of other less popular but similar efforts undertaken
 
throughout this area.
 I would hope that such a precedent so officially
 
recognized as a legal entity by the State of Utah be preserved for the
 
benefit and enjoyment of future generations.
 
Our pledge to aide this fine organization with what limited resources
 
are available is insignificant to meeting ever growing needs of the area.
 
We therefore, recommend the Utah Pallet Folklorico receive
 necessary funds
 
to help sustain their credible role in our continually developing region.

Dear ;
Marino Kintaro,
 
Thank you for your letter.  I am not sure that what you want to do is one of
 
the ,
rinds of things that the Folk Arts Program can fund, but I do have a
 
suggeation for you.
 
If you are still. on Cuam, I would recommend that you go to the Insular Arts
 
Council
. on Guam and talk with the director, Annie Stone, or with the
 
administrative officer, Donna Libenday.  Mrs. I
,ibemday is married to a
 
gentleman from Yap and would understand your probl e
m and what you want to
 
do better than perhaps any other
, person in the office.  Take this letter
 
-
v
;
r
ith you and tell her
. that I recommended that you speak with her.
 
Donna I
.ibe:4day can tell you whether or not your project might come under
 
some part of the Folk Arts Program or some other Program in the National
 
Endowment for the Arts.  Or possibly if it could be funded through the
 
Consortium for Pacific Arts and Cultures.  It is not clear from your letter
 
just exactly what you want to do, or what you need money for or how much you
 
need, and all
. that has to be very clear before you can apply for a grant
 
from
. anybody.  It might even be that the Arts Council on Guair
a itself can
 
help you.
 
I do wish you all good luck in your work.  I shall sand a copy of this
 
letter to Tina Rehuhar
 on Palau, so that she will know what I advised
 
you to do.  And I will enclose a copy of the brochure that describes what
 
the Folk Arts Program does.

 Travel money
 
FY 84 appears to be Folk Arts' year for funning out of money.  In spite
 
of following our normal practice of holding on to a dollar till
. the eagle
 
grins, we are about to come up very very short indeed in terms of staff
 
travel.
 
We show $
1800 in our remaining travel budget.  We would need an additional
 
$1,350 in order to do the following:
 
1
)  Send
. T
ian ,
Sheehy to New York City and Chicag=o
 
:
•
Say 14-18 for numerous site visits in both locales, especially
 
Hispanic organizations, both grantees and potential applicants.
 
2
:
)  Send Bob '
Teske to New Jersey May 9-10 to evaluate
 
(along with a panelist) ar
t Advancement candidate and to visit
 
a Foltz Arta funded crafts exhibition.
 
$650
 
$
 200
 
3
)  Send Dan Sheehy to Los Angeles, July 14 and 15 to the
 $&25
 
first major Folk Arts funded Plaza de la Raza e
=vent, while there
 
he will fisit other grantees and/or potential applicants and
 
will
. return home via San Francisco for the same purposes.
 
4
)  send Bob Teske to Logan, Utah to the Austin Fife Con "rene $670
 
ference on Western Folklore (June 11-15) where a meeting of
 
all the western states folk arts coordinators will take place
 
concurrently, allowing, Bob to meet with 30 or so individuals of
 
great importance to our program with a minimal of travel.
 
5
)  Send Tess to the North Carolina Britisb-American
 $180
 
Festival June 2-4, again, a rallying point for a numbe=r of
 
individuals c
an the east coast of importance to the Program.
 
Lots of work could be done there for relatively little money.
 
6
)  Send Bess or Bob to Philadelphia for a two day con-
 $275
 
ference of state folk arts coordinators (east coast), July 9-10.
 _

As you can see, we have some difficult decisions to wake.  If
. there is any
 
spare money lying about unused so-mewhere, could i
t possibly be channelled
 
our way?  w
e can put it to excellent purpose.
 
Should the cupboard be absolutely bare, we do have $1,430 in our printing
 
budget that we had reserved for betting out our new brochure.  `
xe bave not
 
proceeded with the brochure because we still have several boxes of the old
 
one available.  If we delayed the new brochure uatil FY 85, could we
 
transfer those printing funds to travel in T
AY 8G?

Hear aarbara McDermitt,
 
.
lust a quick suggestion in answer to yours of march 19.  1 :
dust spoke with
 
a fellow named Dick Van Kleeck at the K
entucky Center for the Arts in
 
Louisville, Kentucky.  He is in char ,
.e of folk arts projects at this S
�or?eous
 
new facility, and has alraa
:dy run one story telling concert and plana to include
 
traditional story tellers in his upcoming festival.  It occurred to me that
 
he might be interested in sponsoring your filn or helping you find a sponsor.
 
I discovered when I was talking to him, however, that I didn't quite '
know
 
what you would require of a sponsor -- is it simply to act as a f
loe-through
 
agent, would it be responsible for providing extensive amounts of money, or
 
would it he the place where the files is actually* put together (
in other words
 
do they have to have filsa making and editing facilities'
,
.?
 
So we decided at the end of the conversation the best thi n
; would be for e
re
 
to suggest that you write him a letter and copy u
se, spelling your whole
 
problem out.  In reference to the Kentucky Center, he says that as a new
 
facility, they are having a bit of a financial crunch themselves but anticipate
 
much better days do
lwa the road.  Thoy have marvellous recording facilities and
 
and will eventually got a f
ilm studio but do not have it as of now.  I
le is
 
intri,;ued by your idea and thinks that maybe the Center would be too, depending
 
on the tir
:xe factor and just what your needs are.
 
It does seem to me that there are many sources that would be delighted to
 
sponsor your project i
f all you wart is a flow--through organization.  Have
 
you talked with George :
?olt7
 
All the best.  Don't give up the ship. there are many ways out of this Jam,
 
it seems to M.

Dear Bert,
 
At a meetinT of the Texas Folklore Society that I spoke at this month, a
 
Polish ;antieman came up to r
ye and pressed t
his book into my hand.  Apparently,
 
he had grown up in Poland reading Zane Greg and the like, and now, as a grown
 
non living in Houston and working for an oil company, he has tire and the
 
funds to follow hi6 early inclinations.  So he researches cowboy lore every
 
chance he gets...
 
Anyway, although I highly approve of gettinC computers to do indexes and
 
also approve of people willing to do the donkey labor involved, we really
 
have no way to put this book to any real use, and I thought it would be
 
appropriate to donate i
t to the Austin Fife Library.  I
've told Mr. Von-Yx
-szewski
 
that I was doing this, and I think he would greatly appreciate a note that it
 
has gotten there and will be made available to researchers.  It's a beautifully
 
produced volume...
 
Please give Austin and ,U
 to my best when you see them.

Dear 1
`r. Von-Maszewsici,
 
I have just finished reading your introduction to the Index of The Trail Drivers
 
of `
texas with great interest.  You have certainly done an impressive amount
 
of research and scholars of the future will surely be appreciative of the
 
usefulness of your Index.  It is also nice to Bee computers put to such humane
 
purposes!
 
I have sent one of the two copies you gave me to the Chairman of the Folk
 
Arts advisory panel, Pr. Bert ;
,
Filson of Utah State University.  Ur. Wilson
 
among his other duties is in char;~e  of the Austin Fife Library of Western
 
Folklore.  Your '
gook will be donated to that major collection in your name,
 
and
. I am sure that you will get a note of appreciation when they have had
 
titae to accession it properly.  If you ever ,
et a chance, you should �o b
y
 
and visit that library; it is most impressive.
 (
Dr. Fife still lives in
 
Logan, but his health is so '
hail that he has bad to withdraw from active
 
work.)
 
It was a pleasure to meet you in Huntsville, and thank you again for your
 
generous sift.  The Folk Arts Program is proud to have a copy of your fine
 
work, and will put it to good use.

 Stone:
 
Thank you for your recent application for the continuation of the Guam Folk
 
Arts Coordinator position and the festival of local traditional arts.  I have
 
a couple of additional items of information to request of you to go along, with
 
your application.
 
First, please send us a resume for the current folic arts coordinator.  The
 
interim report you sent seems sufficient, but a resume would be helpful as
 
well.
 
Second, please forward to T
ae a list of the Folk Arts Advisory Panel members
 
with a brief biographical sketch of each member.  We ask this of all agencies
 
in your situation applying for the continuation
. of positions, since the role
 
of the advisory panel
. can be so important in keeping, the r
oll
: arts programs
 
well-advised.
 
Finally, any additional descriptive information of the progr a;s carried out
 
under the prexious grant or the artists you expect will be invited to the
 
festival described in the current. applications would, I think, be a helpful
 
supplemeu
 t to the application materials.  This could take the form of
 
photographs of artists and events such as the basket symposium or apprenticeship
 
workshops, audiotapes of muoical artists involved in events associated with
 
the grant, a description of artists tentatively planned to participate in the
 
festival, and so forth.
 
I regret imposing upon you the extra burden of th ese requests for mora support
 
mater nal, but I am certain that they would be of importance to our panelists
 
as they review your grant application.

Subject:  Folk Arts 1935 Fiscal Situation
 
Using the rounded-off bottom line figures in the FY 86 0
11M Budget Development
 
chart, it can be seen that Folk Arts is in serious danger of slipping backward,
 
fiscally speaking, just at the time when our long-term developmental efforts
 
are beginning to pay off.  cart of our problem is that, compared to other
 
programs, we go up and down by such small increments t
hat it's hard to
 
realize that a very hefty proportion of Folk Arts' overall
. budget a cut of
 
a :
sere $200,000 actually turns out to be.  In the Congressional submission,
 
we are austaining a cut of darned near 7Z and that's a pretty big chunk.
 
This is the more difficult for us because of our new initiative.  Again
 
�3Q0,000 (
ear-marked for State-based Apprentice Pilot Programs) doesn't seem
 
like much in one way but i
t's lQl of our FY 84 bud^et, so in 1985 we're
 
going to have to economize on our other projects by a total of 17% of our 1984
 
allocation, an amount that is going
, to be quite noticeable if not close to
 
impossible.
 
Actually, our successes are beginning to strangle us; we have always prided
 
ourselves on flexibility and resourcefulness, but we're losing options every
 
s
tay.  Forty states now have folk arts pro."rams, we are still in the salary
 
sta^e on twenty of theca, and another ten no longer want salary but come in
 
each year with such well though--out and researched applications they are
 
impossible to turn down.  Add to those 30 grants annually the current 12
 
states with State-based Pilot Apprenticeship programs in 1984 and add on
 
a
nother 5 SPA's in 1985 and another 5 SPA's in 1986.  At an average of
 
$25,0
300 per grant in these categories, we've allocated a million and a quarter
 
before we ever
. get the panel meeting started.  Sigh.  Or '
maybe it's good?
 
What I
'm sure of is that it leaves us feeling terribly urgent about all the
 
small increases we can possibly pick up in the corners.  We need whatever
 
you can do for us.

Dear H
fr. Devling,
 
I certainly sympathize with your disappointment over the Folk Arts panel's
 
rejection of your recent application for support of a seminar and concert
 
series in connection with the exhibit "Black Folk Art in America".  Signing
 
rejection letters is the single worst part of my job.
 
I must, however, rise to the defense of our reviewing panel and challenge one
 
phrase of your letter of March 21.  The panel did not in any way take its
 
action "lightly."  Indeed, a good thirty minutes of precious panel time was
 
expended in vigorous discussion of your application.  The final vote was
 
split, which means that you had support for your project from several panelists.
 
i
loweaver, we follow majority rules, and there simply was not the required clear
 
majority favoring
; the application for the several expressed reasons I reported
 
to Carolyn 61actmon over the telephone.  It might interest you to know that
 
we handled 135 applications requesting; approximately $2,205,O00 at that meeting.
 
Our total annual Program budget for FY 198+ is $2,975,000.  We have terribly
 
little to spread around over our enormous constituency.
 
To clear up one small point of possible misunderstanding between Carolyn Ulackmon
 
and me, I checked the application folder and found no record of the fact that
 
Robert Thompson of Yale was planning; to participate..  I do not know that that
 
information would have affected the results of the panel's deliberations; I
 
only mention it hoping there were not other parts of the picture missing at
 
the time of the panel meeting.
 
With all best wishes for the success of your efforts, I am,
 
Very sincerely yours,

RE.
 Grant #R6a-54-169, to TELACU
 
This was a grant to folklorist Alicia Gonzalez, the grant's project director,
 
I believe, to do a history of the ethnic and folk traditions of the Boyle
 
Heights area of Los Angeles,  The involvement of TELACU was marginal, it was
 
a flow-through organization for the project.
 
I was living in Los Angeles at the time, and I first met Alicia Gonzalez when
 
she was doing the project.  Some of the fieldwork; accomplished under the grant
 
was put to goon use in locating traditional artists of that area to participate
 
in the Smithsonian's Bicentennial Festival of American Folk
 life.  At the
 
comi
x
,unity center in Boyle Heights, I can remember that there were a number of
 
folk arts workshops for the public, organized by Alicia, probably under t
he
 
TU ACU grant.
 
I contacted Alicia by telephone concerning the grant.  She told me that she
 
kept all the financial records of expenditures herself, and might he able
 
to dredge them up from her files if necessary.  I personally have high
 
regard for her professional competence and honesty and I feel certain that
 
she complied closely with the grant's terms.
 
If necessary, we could consult our files for more information.  Our 1976 grant
 
files are housed in the Archive of Folk Culture at the Library of Congress.

Dear Mr. Spence,
 
Your December letter keeps rising to the surface of my pile of things yet
 
to take care of, and then Iput it back
. because I haven't thought haw to
 
advise you.  There are no agencies that I know of that fund research
 
positions of the kind you describe.  My only Washington suggestion at the
 
moment is that you write the Folklife Center at t
he Smithsonian Institution
 
and see i
f they are beginning to hire people for their annual festival of
 
American Folklife.  but you see, if you get such a job, you would than
 
find
, yourself working on the Festival, not doing research.  One of my big
 
disappointments when I came to Washington was to discover that the Library
 
of Congress is open only from nine to five on weekdays and not at all on
 
weekends.  I
f I want to use the Library, I have to take time off my regular
 
job.
 
There is something else I have to say to you that is hard.  There are a
 
great many people who want to teach courses in history and Americas folk
 
song; quite a few of them actually have.  There are many more people who
 
want to research and write about American folk songs, especially mountain
 
songs, and quite a fcv of theca have.  You might be able to do the " things
 
with more sensitivity and love but your interests are not so unusual from
 
the Washington perspective as they might seem in West Virginia.
 
I think you ought to try and travel around a little, get to know more
 
people.  See things from a larger perspective.  For instance, you might
 
think about visiting the Country '
.
Music Mall of Fame in Nashville; there's
 
a nice fellow in the research library th ere  name
d Jay  Orr  and another
 
named Charley Seeman.  They could show you through the facilities they
 
have there as well as their research collections of records, books and
 
manuscripts.  Yaybe you could line up something there; don't think of
 
L
c
asshington as your only hope.
 
Finally, let me remind you that the most important and significant work in
 
both anthropology and folklore has been c
lone by amateurs, scholars and
 
lovers who never intended to get (
and rarely did) a cent for their labors
 
It 
- 2 -
 
Folklore especially is a field that appeals to our deepest feelings, and
 
I hope yours continue to carry you on in the research.  I did see your
 
article in Goldenseal and liked it.  Why not keep on doing
, such work?
 
Why not, indeed, consider writing a column on folk music for nest
 
Virginia country or local newspapers?  I
'd bet the papers would love to
 
have it, you could, as ny father used to, use it as a way to get into
 
correspondence with people who knew the rest of the songs he used to
 
print in part.  All kinds of nice things might begin to happen.

In response to your request for information regarding the Folk Arts Advisory
 
Panel's review of your recent application for support of a catalogue to
 
accompany an exhibition of Afro-American folk art at Case Western Reserve
 
University, I shall summarize below the principal
. points raised during discussion
 
of the project.  Since the National Endowment for the Arts does not request
 
written comments fror: reviewers as does the National
. Endowment for the Humanities,
 
the following suwmary of the panel discussion is the only written record
 
available.  I hope it will be helpful.
 
The panel's primary concern was the variety of types of artists whose work
 
had been selected for inclusion in the exhibition and catalogue.  O
tt the
 
basis of the slide samples submitted, the panel felt that some of the artists
 
were traditional and working with traditional forms (
the quilters) while
 
others were food commercial artists working outside any clearly recognizable
 
traditional (metal workers) and still others were sot-so-good ams tevr artists
 
(
drawings).  As we try to make clear in our guidelines, the folk Arts Program
 
currently confines itself primarily to the support of traditional arts and
 
artists.  The panel felt that the rationale for including these varying grouts
 
of artists in such an exhibition -- the urban experience and its influende on
 
Afro-American traditional art forms -
-- was not really fully enough developed
 
to justify our going outside our oum guidelines.
 
The panel was also concerned that the catalog would not be available until
 
after the exhibition and festival had taken place.  Finally, they noted t
hat
 
none of the Afro-American artists included in Dories Erhard's exhibition of
 
"Older Cleveland Folk Artists" were represented in the project.  This last
 
observation was neither positive nor negative but led to a bit of speculation
 
as to how the field work had been planned.
 
I hope you will find this summary of the panel's discussion of your application
 
helpful.  Please contact me i
f I can be of any further assistance; I can be
 
reached at 202/682-5449.

Attached is the description of a project for the Folk Arts fellow for the

to this procedure.  Folk Arts has in the past prided itself on working
 
out suitable projects with our fellows/interns in a flexible manner,
 
allowing particular interests to develop during t
he fellowship period
 
rather than ramming these into an already developed p
lan.  I also feel
 
that there should be no additional paperwork in this already over-papered

Dear Mr. Thomas:
 
Thank you for your letter of March 30 to our Folk Arts Program.  Our Program
 
Director, Bess Lomax Hawes;, has asked that I get back to you concerning your
 
inquiry.  I tried to reach you by telephone a couple of weeks ago and left a
 
message for you, but on the chance that you did not receive it or are having
 
your s
nail forwarded to another address, I decided to drop you a line or two.
 
The best thin; I can do for you at this point, I t
hink, is send you a copy of
 
our program guidelines that describes some of what we can do, cannot do,
 
generally do not do, and generally do do.  With the limited detail in your
 
letter, it is difficult to pick any part of your plans out and tell you t
hat
 
it fits in well with what our program is set up to do.  We do not fund the
 
research or publishing of books, so that eliminates one portion of your
 
project.  Other limitations are that we do not fund international travel, nor
 
projects out of the political domain of the United States (which of course
 
includes; portions of the South Pacific).  Since we are part of the Natioual
 
Endowment for the Arts, we focus our funding on traditional art fortes.  Your
 
Plans seem to be t
auch pore inclusive than this, and we should probably have
 
a detailed talk about all the specifics of what you want to do in order to
 
be able to take a closer look for aspects that would fit in with our
 
prosra-matic airw.
 
Give t
ae a call some time, if you would like to pursue the setter further.
 
If you call me person-to-person eollect and leave your name and number, I
 
will return your call as soon as I a
ss able.  My telephone number is

I would like to call your attention to the upcoming Festival of Pacific Arts
 
and Cultures to be held in New Caledonia this coming December.  This major
 
cultural effort takes place every four years; this year's is the fourth.
 
It may startle you to realize -- it did me -- that the United States has
 
never made any effort to participate in this occasion except through its
 
individual regional states and territories, all of whom have regularly
 
scraped together delegations of musicians, dancers and craftspeople without
 
federal funding or even any especial technical or cultural assistance from
 
the mainland.
 At the last Festival, which was held in New Guinea, I was
 
told that no member of the local American embassy had bothered to attend
 
any of the events, and there was no United States newspaper or media coverage.
 
This contrasts sharply with France and Great Britain which sent, I understand,
 
both Radio Francaise and the BBC as well as newspaper reporters.
 
As far as I know now, the following American states and territories intend
 
to participate in December:
 Guam; the Republic of Belau (Palau); the
 
Marshall Islands; Hawaii; American Samoa; the Commonwealth of the Northern
 
Marianas; and the Federated States of Micronesia (Yap; Kosrae; Truk; Ponape).
 
The Folk Arts Program at the National Endowment for the Arts is prevented
 
by law from funding overseas travel expenses but we are working with Hawaii,
 
Belau, the Northern Marianas and Guam on pre-festival preparations (
costuming,
 
rehearsals, development of craft displays and the like), and I anticipate we
 
will hear from some of the other American related participants in due course.
 
However, the Pacific is a very long way away, and anthropological,cultural,
 
and technical expertise is hard to come by and expensive to send around.
 
Especially  in Micronesia, feelings of nationalism are running high.
 I
've
 
found on my two visits to the area that the people are extremely interested
 
in technical assistance and cultural information but are not at all disposed
 
towards being studied further nor in any kind of uninvited cultural intervention.
 
However, most of Micronesia has been culturally weakened by the unending
 
sequence of long-term European conquests and the ravages of World War II, so
 
much so that many of the peoples themselves are doubtful that they have any
 
b
 
- 2
 
indigenous culture left at all.  My most frequent conversation during my
 
visits to Guam and Saipan concerned whether or not this or that cultural
 
artifact was Spanish in provenience!
 (
The Chamorran language contains a
 
good bit of Spanish, so the people have concluded that everything that is
 
even slightly old must have been equivalently Hispanicized; this rarely
 
seemed the case to me.)
 
With the exception of the extremely important work undertaken by Stephen
 
Arvizu in California, little anthropological attention has been paid to
 
Micronesia recently, nor to current developments in Hawaii and American
 
Samoa for that matter.
 I
'm afraid most anthropologists prefer to tackle
 
the less acculturated areas such as New Guinea snd the Solomons, which
 
brings me to the point of this long letter.
 
I would like to recouuuend to the Wenner-Gren Foundation that it send to
 
the Festival a small delegation -- perhaps two or three -- senior cultural
 
activists of the type that attended Alan's conference a couple of years
 
ago -- with, 1
) a general charge to observe the development of overall
 
Pacific cultural and artistic policies as evidenced at the Festival and
 
the subsequent Conference, and 2
) an especial responsibility to take a
 
good look at the cultural presentations made by the American territories
 
and states.  A solid report on both these might be of enormous help in
 
working out appropriate cultural policies o
n the federal and state levels
 
especially at NEH and NEA, and could also be of help to UNESCO, which is
 
planning its own Pacific-wide music survey for later on next year.  While
 
at the Festival such a delegation could also spend time talking with the
 
American-related performers as well as with the folks from the Consortium
 
.
for Pacific Arts and Cultures (
Guam, Northern Marianas and American Samoa)
 
about their varied cultural situations back home.
 Such conversations might
 
easily stimulate island-specific plans that could be put into effect after
 
everybody has scattered.
 
I would recommend that such a delegation be carefully selected from senior
 
individuals with combined experience in Pacific ethnography, cross cultural
 
art forms and international, especially Third World, negotiations.  Alan
 
Lomax comes to mind as does Ted Carpenter, Ward Goodenough, Ricardo Trimillos,
 
Stephen Arvizu, Adrienne Koeppler; two or three people would probably be
 
enough.  If the project seems worthwhile to the Foundation, I would be happy
 
to help develop more specific goals and responsibilities.  The United States
 
has an extraordinary record of neglecting the Pacific except in war time
 
when we apparently regard these islands as simple aircraft carriers divested
 
of human life.  This seems to me a golden opportunity, with all manner of
 
people assembled in one place, to discuss how we too may join in Pacific
 
unity and peaceful cooperation.
 
I shall enclose the latest publication on the Festival that has reached me.
 
With all best wishes,
 
Sincerely,

Dear Sister Werner:
 
Thank you for your letter of March 12 to our Folk Arts program concerning
 
your Alaskan interests.  I am sending; you a copy of our program guidelines
 
so give you an idea of our program's grant offerings.
 
As you can see from our program description, we focus our funding mainly
 
toward assisting the folk artist directly through direct presentation,
 
direct documentation (
such as film documentaries or ethnographic radio
 
documentaries), and statewide programs of technical assistance.  Judging
 
from your letter, what you are planning is much more research oriented
 
than the type of projects we fund.  In your case, the funding would be
 
concentrated more on the researcher than on the artist being documented.
 
Also, at the moment, there is a fair amount of systematic documentation of
 
Alaskan Native Arts being done, particularly by the Institute of Alaskan
 
Native Arts.  You might be interested in receiving their newsletter.

Dear ;
q
tr. Fuhrifean:
 
Our Folk Arts Program Director, Bess Lomax Hawes, is out of town and asked that
 
1 respond on her behalf to your letter of March lb concerning readers' comments
 
on your recant application to our program.
 
Though the National Endowment for the Humanities and many other large federal
 
agencies have formal systems of sending out the applications they receive to
 
readers who are experts in their field and then feeding those readers' critical
.
 
comments into the panel review of the application, we do not have such a system.
 
The applications we receive are assembled by the staff and sent directly to our
 
program panelists who then copse together three times each year to jointly discuss
 
and compare the applications in order to determine which are funded and which are
 
not.
 (The panel's recommendations are then sent on to the National Council for
 
the Arts and the Chairman of the Arts Endowment for review and final action.)
 
Consequently, we do not have written comments by readers.  We do, however, try
 
to keep summary notes on the salient points of the discussion of each grant
 
application.
 
I personally thought your application was well written and included a good
 
amount of detail.  There also seemed to be good integration into the local
 
Mexican American community. which was also a very positive point.  The main
 
reasons your application did not fare well in the grant competition have to do
 
with our program guidelines and priorities.
 
T
tie folk arts world is a very large one, and our Folk Arts Program is a very
 
small one.
 (
o
de represent about 22% of the Arts endowments' budget.)  Consequently,
 
we have had to focus our efforts on t
he  most authentic and most representative
 
traditional artists as our main constituency.  As you can see from the enclosed
 
Folk Arts brochure, we are very much concerned that traditional artists, those
 
artists who have learned their skills informally through a traditional system
 
of learning that is a longstanding part of community life, get the recognition
 
and assistance that they so much deserve and so often go without.  We look for
 
artists who in the fullest possible sense represent the shills, traditional
 
aesthetics, and traditional lifestyle t
hat go hand in hand with the art form
-
they represent.  In the case of Mexican and Mexican American arts, for example,
 
n
 
we have supported programs of conjunto musicians from Texas, jarocho musicians
 
from Veracruz (
but now resident in the United Staters), and a series of traditional
 
huapaugo dancing classes Rivers by an authentic representative of that regional
 
art form and lifestyle, a fellov from San Luis Potosi (
now living; in California).
 
This, of course, is not to say that t
he dance classes you had planned nor the
 
artist you had in mind are not high quality and generally a good idea.  I
 
personally think they are, as I feel efforts at preserving the rich diversity
 
that makes our country the exciting place to live that it is are extremely
 
important.  But, all that is part of cultural heritage is not necessarily
 
traditional folk art, something that is much narrower in scope.
 
In addition, a sizable amount of the money you requested was for costumiug.  The
 
purchase of coeatumes for a stage version of folk dance falls vay down in the
 
priorities of our program and has been funded only on rare occasions.
 
If you are interested in applying again to our program, I suggest you give ne a
 
call to talk over your plans.  If you like, you may call me person.-to-person
 
collect, leave your name and number, and I will return your call as soon as I
 
aL; abla.

I am dropping a note to the Governor's assistant in charge of education about

s about my last official act for

From:  Bess Lotiax Hawes
 
Subject:  Pacific Festival of Arts and Cultures
 
I believe I have already mentioned to you the upcoming Festival of Pacific Arts
 
and Cultures, an every-four--years event that is the single most highly valued
 
and significant international arts event of the Pacific basin.  On both my trips
 
to the region, one of the sorest points I uncovered was what the locals saw as
 
almost total state-side indifference to this major artistic program.  Not only
 
was the Endowment not represented at the 1980 Third Festival in Papua New Guinea,
 
but we were not especially helpful in arranging
; delegations from any of '
tour`'
 
Pacific islands?  U.S. Embassy personnel stationed in New Guinea were conspicuously
 
absent at the event itself, nor was there U.S. network or newspaper coverage (in
 
contrast to BBC, Australian, and Air France radio and television crews which were
 
present in force).  It is one of the long-term mysteries of American political
 
thought that we so blithely overlook the serious concerns of our Pacific
 
constituency; sometimes I think we think of the islands as just floating military
 
bases inhabited by Sea Bees left over from World War II and crabs.
 
Anyway, to get off my soapbox, I recommend that you glance through the attached
 
report/program, with possible Endowment participation in mind.  Personally, I
 
think you ought to go yourself and work in a trip to Hawaii along the way.
 
Failing that, I recommend in the strongest terms you send Hugh.  The Festival
 
itself will conclude with a two n
ay international conference analyzing what has
 
occurred, laying the first plans for 1988 and preparing for various kinds of
 
cultural developments in the intervening four years.  I think the Endowment should
 
be represented at that meeting by one of its top level spokesmen, most especially
 
someone who is used to international discussion and debate.
 It is possible my
 
brother, Alan Lomax, will be attending on behalf of the Wenner-Gren Foundation,
 
but there should be Endowment representation as well.

From the 23 participating units, from the huge (Australia) to the tiny (Nauru)
 
the United States is fielding 7
, or almost one-third (
the underlined island names).
 
We
. thereby,have  a genuine presence in this affair.  The Folk Arts Program, you will
 
be interested to know, is already participating to the tune of two grants (
to J
Iardaii
 
and the Northern Marianas)  helping prepare participating delegations with appro-
priate costumes, instruments, rehearsal times etc.
 
,
'f
inally, I have had a word with Sarah Richards, director of the Hawaii State
 
Foundation on the Arts and Culture; she tells me they estimate $1,200 round
 
trip air fare per person from Honolulu to Noumea and offers to include a
 
representative from the Endowment in their overall arrangements.  This does
 
not mean financial assistance, just scheduling, hassling with airlines and
 
room reservations if we would like her office to help.  They intend to send
 
a hula troupe plus several craftsworkers and at least two representatives
 
from the Hawaii State Foundation, so whoever goes fror. here should be in
 
interesting company.
 
Please return the booklet when you've glanced through it.
 It's in short supply
 
locally.

Artists evaluated at March Folk Arts Panel Meeting
 
Juliet Antunes, Director
 
Arts America, United States Information Agency
 
Here is the list of artists and groups recently referred to us for review at
 
our 1
1arch Folk Arts Progran panel meeting.  They are arranged into the three
 
categories of highly Recommended, Recommended, or Not Recommended.
 
Highly Recommended
 
The Sensational Eightengales
 
Stars of Faith
 
Bessie Griffin
 
Frank Yankovic
 
Sweet Honey in the Pock
 
Recommended 
Clark Sisters
 
Now Gospel Arts Singers (Rev. Thorlas Brown)
 
Tracy's Family Band
 
Tony Trischka and Skyline
 
Jacqueline Steiner
 
Not kecommanded

Wally Keiderling
 
Piper Road Spring Band
 
Heather Forest (
*She was inappropriate for Folk Arts evaluation
 maybe
 
Theatre)
 
New Song Q
hxintet
 
Stormy Rica String Band
 
In addition,
 
As Sandy Rouse may have told you, dick Foloney's suggested tour of dancers/
 
musicians was highly recommended.  Since Kick Moloney is currently a -
,
umber
 
of our advisory panel, he left the room during the discussion of his proposal
 
to avoid the situation of possible conflict-of-interest.

in regard to suggestions for comparable artists to replace John D
. Holeman
 
and Fria Solloway, the sole duo recommended was t
he combination of Phil Biggins
 
and John Cephus.  I understand, though, that they are scheduled to tour elsewhere
 
at about the same time.  There was a comment that with many folk performers, they
 
begin to hit their stride a
fter the experience of the first tour or two, and it
 
would be a shaue to replace thew right at t
he point where t
hey may be at t
heir
 
best.
 
Finally, any of t
he gospel groups highly reco =ended above were suggested as appro-
p
riate for your interest in a amall gospel group or individual soloist in the
 
event there are additional funds remaining at the end of Fiscal year 19£
34.
 
I hope all this fits your needs.  It was helpful having
_
, Sandy at the meeting; she
 
is a pleasure to work with.

frank Conroy, of the Literature Program, asked me to respond to your request
 
for information on helping communities invite Native American sinoina groups
 
to an area.  I a
re enclosing a copy of the folk Arts brochure that explains
 
what the progran that I direct does in the Arts Endowment and something of ho;a
 
we go about it.  I hope it will give you some useful ideas.
 
I have two additional suggestions.  You have a Folic Arts Coordinator in your
 
state whose full time job it is to help traditional community artists and arts
 
activities.  His name is Steven 0hrn and you can reach him through the Iowa
 
Arts Council (
402 Myrtle, Iowa City, Iowa 52240  515/281-4451).or State Capitol
 
3uilding, Des Moines, Iowa 50319  515/281-4451).  He might be able to give you
 
some on-the-spot assistance through the Arts Council.  You might want also to
 
get in touch with Dr. Charlotte Beth, American Indian Study Center, University
 
of California, Los Angeles,  Las Angeles, CA  90024.  Dr. i
leth is a Cherokee
 
with a PhD in music education and ethnomusicology; she is the person I always
 
consult when questions concerning Native American music come up, and I am sure
 
she would try to give you the very most recent information.
 
I hope the above ideas are helpful.

Corn Island Storytelling Festival

Louisville, KY  40243
 
Dear .11s.  Thomason,
 
Thank you for your recent letter regarding possible Folk Arts Program support
 
for the Centenarians program of the Corn Island Storytelling Festival.  I am
 
enclosing a copy of the Polk Arts guidelines and application forms for your
 
information and use.
 
Because our advisory panel gives highest priority to traditional artists as
 
opposed to interpreters of folk traditions or so--called "revivalists,` I
 
would recommend that you address the traditionality of the Centenarians in
 
the narrative accompanying your application.  In addition, I would suggest
 
that you consider including a consultant or advisor with academic training in
 
folklore or a related discipline to assist in the identification and presen-
tation of traditional storytellers at the Corn Island Festival.  If you have
 
not already contacted an appropriately qualified advisor, you might wish to
 
get in touch with either Roby Cogswell of the :
Kentucky Arts Commission's
 
Folk Arts in Rural Libraries project. or Richard Van Kleeck, t
he Director of
 
Folk
. Arts Progra ming at the Kentucky Center for the Arts.  They could
 
certainly put you in touch with other qualified personnel or might he willing
 
to offer their own assistance in support of your project.
 
I a
mi enclosing with the Folk Arts guidelines a copy of a checklist specifying
 
the types of supporting materials which should accompany your application.  If
 
it would be possible to submit your application within a week or tan days of
 
the April 1
, 1934 deadline, I believe we mould still have sufficient t1 m to
 
process your proposal for panel consideration at our June meeting.
 
Thank you for your interest in the Folk Arts Program, and I hope you will feel
 
free to contact me s
`uould you have any questions regarding the application or
 
review procedures.
 
Sincerely yours,

Dear Charley,
 
Thanks main for being
, such a pleasant host and running me around t
he town
 
and the airport during nY  recent trip to Nashville.  I hope the visit will
 
prove to have been useful.  I
'm afraid my overall opinion on the Tennessee
 
Arts Council remains that they can surely use a good folk arts coordinator.
 
I talked up the job a bit on my rounds and understand that four or five
 
pretty well-qualified persons will be applying or already have.  Please let
 
me k
xaow if there is anything e
lse t
hat we can do from here.
 
Hope to see you at the archives conference i
f not sooner.  By the way, we
 
have a '
Mang system.  Is that compatible with anything else?
 
All t
he best always t
o you, Jay, Bill, Charles and all other good friends

tage debut as
 
a child in Tuskegee as a member of the Gibsonian Dance Troupe, which performed in
 
schools all over the South.
 
Miss Robinson holds a B
.A. degree in dance from Butler University, and a M.F.A.

University.
 She has taught ballet to children and adults at the Dance Theatre of
 
Boston, and at the Dance Theatre of Harlem.
 
Throughout her career, Miss Robinson's own study has f
ortunately been with many
 
great teachers in dance and theatre, but she considers the most influential to have
 
been Jessie Gibson in Tuskegee, George Verdak, William Glen, and Thomas Adkins at
 
Butler University, Maurice Bejart in Brussels,  Inez Matthews (
voice), Karel Shook,
 
Co-Director of the Dance Theatre of Harlem, and most of all, dancer, director-cho-

Miss Robinson appeared as guest for two seasons with American Ballet Theatre in
 
the ballet "The Four Marys" by Agnes de Mille.
 She toured the country doing college
 
dance concerts with partner Mike Malone, and she directed, choreographed for, and
 
danced with her own company, the Chamber Dance Group, in Washington, D
.C.

been a member of the Dance Company of the National Center of Afro American Artists in
 
Boston, Maurice Bejart's Ballet of the Twentieth Century in Brussels, Belguim, and a
 
member of Billy Wilson's Dance Theatre of Boston.
 She has choreographed an industrial
 
show f
or the Coca-Cola Company, and choreographed and directed a musical showcase
 
called "Harlem U
.S.A." which was presented at Pace University in New York City.
 
Miss Robinson was a dancer and the assistant to the Choreographer Billy Wilson in
 
the Broadway production of the musical "Bubbling Brown Sugar".
 She has continued as
 
Mr. Wilson's assistant in the preparation of subsequent productions of this show both

 She also assisted Mr. Wilson with the revival of his ballet
 
"Mirage",  f
or the Dance Theatre of Harlem's 1979 New York City Center season.
 
Encouraged and supported by her family, Mayor Johnny Ford, and Mrs. Martha Swan
 
(
then Director of Recreation for the City) Miss Robinson returned home in 1980, was
 
appointed Cultural Enrichment Coordinator f
or the City of Tuskegee and f
ounded the
 
Tuskegee City Dance Theatre.
 In 1982 when the Mayor saw fit to f
orm a Department of

shape the cultural destiny of her home Tuskegee and her People.

History:
 TUSKEGEE CITY DANCE THEATRE
 
The Tuskegee City Dance Theatre was f
ounded in October
, 1980 by director Dyann
 
Robinson.
 It was sponsored by the City of Tuskegee's Recreation Department.
 Inspi-
red by the work of the Dance Theatre, it was soon felt by Mayor Johnny Ford,  the City
 
Council and the community - at - large,  led by a special Ad Hoc Committee that event-
ually became the Mayor's Commission for Cultural Affairs, that a Department of Cul-
tural Affairs should be added to the structure of the City Government.
 In November,
 
1981 that department was begun and Miss Robinson was appointed Director.
 The Dance
 
Theatre was to serve as the new department's artistic professional "core".
 
The purpose of Tuskegee City Dance Theatre i
s to not only provide artistic experi-
ences for audiences but ( because of the great need) to provide an institution where
 
Black dance artists primarily, can receive professional training reflective of their
 
vast, varied, cultural heritage and where Black artists can have professional perform-
ing and other work opportunities as well.
 Tuskegee, a predominately Black City, the
 
home of Tuskegee Institute and a city with a rich cultural heritage, seems a perfect
 
place f
or such an institution.
 
Therefore, without racial discrimination Black Culture i
s emphasized not only in
 
the work of the Tuskegee City Dance Theatre, but in the work of the entire Department
 
of Cultural Affairs.
 The aim is to uplift all the citizens both Black and White, and
 
to better educate them all, whatever their differences with regard to the universality
 
of the culture of all mankind.
 
The Dance Theatre has usually a total s
tudent enrollment of (
45-50) s
tudents (
adults
 
and children) for the Winter Session and the Summer Session.
 Ballet and jazz dance tech-
niques, drama, and dance history are taught.  All the c
lasses including adult classes
 
are taught with a professional end in mind and are divided according to achievement levels.
 
(
General exercise classes are not taught).  All children s
tudents receive performing ex-
perience (
the School and Company participate in the Annual Spring Concert) but the com-
(
con. #2)
 
pany members are selected from the s
tudent body based on their level of achievement.
 
The children's company was begun by giving lecutre dimonstrations by the children
 
in all the local elementary schools.
 The adult company was begun by developing works
 
especially designed for those particular performers with their level of skill in mind
 
incorporating dance and drama, so that the performances were even at f
irst on a pro-
fessional level.
 Since then the school and company has done (
3) major Spring Concerts;
 
the company has made numerous guest appearances at community sponsored events; perfor-
med many times f
or national and international guests at Tuskegee Institute functions,
 
and performed (
2 or 3
) t
imes yearly f
or The Alabama and The National Conference of
 
Black Mayors including a performance at The Birmingham Civic Center f
or The National
 
Conference of Black Mayors.
 The company performed in Prichard, Alabama for its Africa
 
Town Folk Festival (
1982) and at Concordia College in Selma, Alabama.
 This past year
 
(
1983) the company performed at Miles College and at the Birmingham Museum of Art both
 
in Birmingham, Alabama.
 The company also gave its debut performance in Tuskegee's new
 
Municipal Complex Auditorium which now serves as the performance home base for the com-
pany.
 
In October, 1982 the Dance Theatre made its first full length television dance film,
 
f
ilmed by WRMT, the local cable television s
tation on the lawn of Grey Columns, one of
 
the Tuskegee Institute National Historic Sites.
 The company has the copyright privi-
leges to show the f
ilm statewide on public television and in the local schools.
 The
 
Dance Theatre has given (
2) major concerts (
other than the f
ilm) on the lawn of Grey
 
Columns.
 The first in the daytime, the latter at night this past June 12, 1983.  All
 
performances represent a collaborative effort on the part of the City, the community-
at-large, the Tuskegee V
.A. Medical Center, Tuskegee Institute, the National Park Ser-
vice Tuskegee Historic Sites, and the local media.
 
The Dance Theatre and director, Dyann Robinson have been featured on P
.M. Magazine
 
WSFA - T
.V. Montgomery; and University of Alabama Public Television recently filmed a
 
(
con. #3)
 
documentary on Tuskegee City Dance Theatre for its "On Target" show.
 The company has
 
also been featured several times on WSFA's "Focus" (
A Black events showcase program).
 
Between the live performances and their televised presentation (
the Department
 
of Cultural Affairs films most of the Dance Theatre's local performances for local
 
cablevision) the entire community is reached, and through the Dance Theatre's national
 
and international audiences at Tuskegee Institute and The Natioanl Coference of Black
 
Mayors the company has had a kind of international exposure without really moving geo-
graphically.
 
The Dance Theatre is fulfilling its original purposes as well as enhancing its
 
community spiritually and economically by providing a potentially major tourist attrac-
tion and by s
timulating other artistic development from within.
 I
t is playing and will
 
continue to play a significant role in making the City of Tuskegee ultimately an inter-
national "Cultural Mecca".

Dear Ms.  Robinson:
 
We
 have
 received
 your
 proposal and support  materials
 for
 a
 
cultural representation at the  1
984 World's Fair  for  the city
 of
 
Tuskegee.
 It  is with extreme pleasure that I inform you that the
 
I
've
 Known
 Rivers
 Pavilion has chosen both the
 Tuskegee
 City
 
Dance Theatre and  the P.  H.  Polk Exhibition
 for  the  1
984 World's
 
Fair.
 We
 are
 very
 interested
 in exhibiting
 the
 P.  H.  Polk
 
exhibition for  the duration of the Fair - May  12-Nov.
 11,
 1984.
 
The performance schedules have not been confirmed at this writing
 
however
 we are looking at the last week of June and/or  the first
 
week of July.
 
Furthermore  we  would
 like
 to  invite you to
 be
 part
 of
 the
 
official
 "Start-of-Construction
 Celebration"
 on
 Wednesday,
 
February 29,
 1984.
 We feel your solo dance "I Told Jesus" would
 
be
 a  great sample of what  is  to come from Tuskegee as
 well
 as
 
representation
 of  the great magnitude of our Pavilion.
 Details
 
of
 the celebration will be discussed upon your
 acceptance.
 In
 
the  meantime,
 enclosed
 please find  information on
 I
've
 Known
 
Rivers

 We
 look
 forward
 to
 
working with you.

Thank you so much for the interesting

I am sorry our visit was so curtailed

plans for cultural development in the city.
 
I sometimes think these flying visits are less than useless, but perhaps if we
 
pursue our common purposes our paths will cross again.
 I have taken the liberty
 
of forwardin7 your resume to the director of the Dance Program at the Endowment
 
for consideration as a possible dance panelist or performance evaluator.

Dear Ms. Ashby:
 
Thank you for your letter of November to our Folk Arts Program.  I tried on
 
numerous occasions to reach you by telephone, and at one point was given the
 
number 771-6UO5 and I left a message for you.
 
In any event, we have an application deadline cowing up on April 1
, for projects
 
beginning October 1 or later.
 
I was not certain as to precisely what you were interested in obtaining when
 
you asked for the 'Code of Federal Regulations which providea the prevailing
 
minimum compensation for salaries and wages."  If you are interested in any
 
official guidelines followed by our program as to specific wages paid artists,
 
we have none, preferring to consider each case individually.
 
You also requested examples of folk arts coordinators' job descriptions and
 
statement of qualifications.  This is the type of thing that our grantee
 
submits to us when applying
; for a grant for a folk arts coordinator, to be
 
used later in advertising the position.  I have enclosed a few for your information.
 
Now I will move on to your two proposal ideas.  With regard to your idea for the
 
powwow, our advisory panel in the past has tended not to fund powwows, since for the
 
most part t
here already is a traditional system of paying for all that's necessary
 
to organize a powwow, pay the musicians, and so forth.  On the other hand, you
 
seen to be s
taking a case for the powwow you have in ;
rind as being a special case,
 
a special way to honor some of the best elder artists rather than a competition
 
for prizes.  So, you may want to pursue this ides and apply to our program.  You
 
should include vany.more details, however, such as information on the artists
 
performing and the artists being honored, '
tow you plan to honor the elder artists,
 
and any kinds of ways to let the public know about the special beauty and importance
 
of each of the artists and art forms being recognized.
 (
For example, do you have
 
any experts in the traditions involved who could provide information on the art
 
forms for the benefit of those who may not be faailiar with them?)
 
As to the budget, keep in mind that we fund only up to 50% of the total project
 
costs, no more.  You will need to adjust t
he powwow budget accordingly.
 
- 2
 
If the purpose of your planned workshop series and conference i
s to benefit
 
traditional artists and i
f traditional artists are the people demonstrating
 
in the workshops, than your plans for that probably do fall within our program
 
guidelines.  We will, of course, need a good deal more information as to who
 
the artists are, the art traditions. how thev will be presented, the audience,
 
and so forth.
 
To close, I suggest you give me a call sometime to go over your plans, so that
 
you can get as much feedback as possible before committing yourself to paper
 
on the application form.  If you call me person-to-person collect at 202/682-5449
 
and leave your nary and number. I will return your call as soon as I am able.

Dear Mr. Schoenberg,
 
Though this letter comes very late, I still want to express my personal
 
appreciation f
or the thoughtful review you gave the Symphony Space performance
 
of the Manteo Sicilian Marionette Theater in the New `
cork Times of January 20.
 
It is a real pleasure to see this noble artistic tradition discussed in the
 
appropriate section of the paper (
the drama page) by the appropriate person
 
(
the dean of New York
- drama and music criticism).
 
As you may know, a number of people worked very hard helping
, the 4
a
anteos
 
literally "get their act together': -- a trite but in this case totally apposite
 
phrase.  I first heard of the :
ianteos while working on the Smithsonian Festival
 
of American Folklife in 1975.  At that time, they were
: a shadowy rumor, the
 
family almost scattered, their performances rare and fragmented.  Since then
 
a remarkable coalition of scholars, producers, and critics have rallied to
 
help this fine old theatrical tradition rebuild until now it seems a possibility
 
that the Manteos might actually attain
, t
heir remotest dreacx -- their own small
 
theater and puppet Museum on Staten
. Island.
 
I wonder too if you were aware that the Folk Arts Program awarded Papa Manteo
 
one of its early 1ational Heritage Fellowships?  We're really proud of what
 
we are doing here -
- an attempt to adjust the Japanese national cultural
 
treasures concept to fit a complex multi-cultural situation like our own.
 
I think so far we've been pretty successful, and we hope the prograr: will get
 
better each year as we explpre the unbelievable variety that makes up this
 
country.  I shall enclose an article that appeared last year about the fellowships
 
for your general interest.
 
Thank you again for your serious and interesting review.  It made the Manteos
 
and the Folk Arta Program proud.

Dear Mr. Ayala:
 
Thank you for your letter of January 31 to our Polk Arts Program concerning
 
your plans to apply to us for funds to support your festival.
 
It was good to hear of your rather sizable festival and that it has been such
 
a success over the past couple of years.  In terms of obtaining funding from
 
our program for your event, you may qualify to apply, particularly if you can
 
focus your application on a specific component of the festival that highlights
 
top quality traditional artists.  Generally in the past, our advisory panel has
 
chosen not to give grants to festival activities without knowing precisely
 
how our monies would be spent within the overall festival budget.  In other
 
words, we have not given a general contribution to a general
. f
und to finance
 
a festival.  We have for the most part preferred t
hat our funds go toward
 
items that rank high on our program priorities, two of those being honoraria
 
for traditional artists and fees for cultural experts to aid in presenting
 
the traditional artists and traditional art forms so that they may best be
 
appreciated by the festival public.  In completing the enclosed application
 
fora, you should keep this in mind and be as specific as possible in describing
,
 
the content and organization of the festival and the purpose of the money you
 
request from the Endowment.
 
e
lls
io, there is one other important detail that was not in hour
 
exact date of your festival.  our next application deadline is
 
this is for projects that begin October 1 at the earliest.  If
 
will take place after this date, then you are applying; in time
 
an application by April 1

If I can be of any assistance by telephone iu explaining our prorran guidelines

if you call me person-to-person collect and leave your name and number when you

Subject:  Does the USA re wire - or deserve - a national dance?
 
Some months ago, I received a call from Gerry Parsons at the Library of Congress
 
telling; me that the Rational Square Nance Association had mounted a major campaign
 
to have Congress declare the square dance our "national dance.'  This proposal
 
had, for whatever reason, been bucked to the house Yost Office/Civil Service
 
Committee, and its liaison, cautiously mindful of the fact that there are lots
 
of square dancers around, was asking; Gerry for background infow-Mation and expert
 
opinion.  I suggested some names to call and gave m
y owu views, and the following
 
document has just emerged.  I thought you might find it entertaining and
 
informational.

Dear Mr. Deloughery.
 
2
'hauk you for your letter of January 8
.  We have talked it over among the
 
members of the staff here and I have taken it upon myself to dig up a little
 
additional information for you.
 
First of all, I regret to say that I doubt very much t
hat there would be
 
much possibility of getting funding
; for your book from our program.  Our
 
guidelines explicitly state that we do not subsidize the publishing of books,
 
and every time in the past that we have received an application for a boob,
 
our advisory panel has turned it down.  I personally think that a case might
 
be made for the Irish tunebook being a traditional way of transmitting the
 
tradition (
one of the reaso:us we have not supported books is that in the
 
great majority of cases, books would not be an important vay of passing on
 
a tradition within a folk community), but our panel has consistently felt
 
that the case was not exceptional enough to go against the guidelines.  In
 
any case, I cannot paint a very rosy picture for you in the way of funding
 
from our program.
 
I
. do, though, have a couple of other suggestions for you.  Larry McCullough
 
has a company named Silver Spear publications that specializes in Irish
 
music.  You niSht be able to work something out with him.  His address is 1
 
1210 S
. Trace, Austin, Texas  78745.  Another person you might contact with
 
your idea is Nye Heron, the Executive Director of the Irish Arts Center in
 
New York.  I
lia addrerwe is 5
53 W

I am sorry I cannot be of more help on this occasion.  I wish you the beet
 
of luck in your plans.

Dear Hr. I
U11
.p :
 
Thank you for your letter to our program director, Bess Lomax Hawes.  She has
 
been tied up quite a bit lately and asked that I answer your letter.
 
Basically, our operation is strictly a grant program.  We ourselves do not
 
actually do projects, we only administer the process o
f
 finding them.  So, we
 
do not really do much in the way of making documentary films, organizing
 
festivals, or mounting; r
auseum exhibits.  I have enclosed a copy of our program
 
brochure to give you an i
dea of the types of things we fund.
 
though I personally feel that there is a real need for more good ethnographic
 
fil=wkers doing documentaries on subjects right here in the United States,
 
from ny own observation, competition is y
-anerally fierce in the world of the
 
independent filrzaaker, and the few more successful have labored long and hard,
 
usually doing something other than folk documentaries to get by on.  From my
 
perspective, you are in a relatively good position, getting practical profes-
sional experience and having the opportunity to sake potentially valuable
 
personal contacts.  About all I could suggest is that you broaden your contact
 
with other ethnographic filimiakers as such as possible, getting your own
 
professional capabilities known among your colleagues.
 
I d
on't know if this has been helpful at all, but at the very least, I hope
 
you find the brochure interesting
_
,.  Although I do not see any positions opening
 
up here in your line of work, if you nevertheless feel it would be fruitful to
 
meet with Ks. Hawes. I am sure she will try as best as possible to fit in an
 
appointment for you.  You can reach her secretary at 202/682-5449.
 
I wish you the best of success in your career.

Dear Zack,
 
Just a quick note to thank you for loaning us your fine Assistant Director,
 
Hank F
aillett, last week on the occasion of the presentation of the proposed
 
1984 folk Arts Zuidelines to the National Council on the Arts.  Such guideline
 
discussions are usually accompanied by a thorough review of the entire program's
 
activities and each Program gets an hour or so with the Council to make its
 
case.  This year we had wanted to focus the Council's discussion on our newly
 
developing state folk arts programs and such new efforts as the state-based
 
apprenticeship prograx
i; and suddenly I thought what better person to help a
we
 
describe the "state of t
he states"  than tank Willett.  He has run a model
.
 
state folk arts program for more pears than I care to remember now, and besides
 
has just authorr
a3 a successful proposal to the Folk Arts Program for a state
 
apprenticeship g
.rant.
 
Hank spoke effectively before the Council and showed real poise and mastery
 
of the issues.  I
le answered questions coolly and well and the brief slide
 
program he showed concerning two traditional Alabama folk artists was very
 
well received.  He really was an enormous help, and I hoard many favorable
 
comments after our presentation.
 
All of which reminds me, while I
'm compli^ieating Hank, t
o go on for yet one
 
more ;
paragraph.  I have shoran Hank's Report on the State Folk Arts Program
 
around the Endowment and again received very favorable reactions.  The Chairman,
 
who particularly enjoys statistics, was enthusiastic about the report and urged
 
me to consider how i
t might be updated annually.  Hank, as you know, chaired
 
the covmittee that collected all that data, and then spent a great deal of his
 
own time chasing down tardy responses, pulling the information together into
 
usuable form, and finally writing the completed report.  He did a fine job, and

I an sorry to have delayed so lon  in respondin& to your letter of January 24.
 
These have been exceptionally busy days hereabouts.
 
Your letter, however, brought good news, and I want to express the Polk Arts Program's

Dear Mrs. Fitzsimmons:
 
I moat first apologize for taking so very long to an ger your letter of December 30.
 
We have been extremely busy this past months still . I should have been able to do
 
better than this  
Your project of celebrating the 350th anniversary of James City County sounds
 
fascinating . I do not know of folklorists right in your iamediate area, but
 
there are at least three in Virginia who might be able to advise you or might
 
know of names that I do not have.  Let me recommend Professors Charles (
Chuck)
 
and Ran Perdue of the University of Virginia in Charlottesville first of all;
 
they are especially interested in oral history and have produced many articles on
 
Virginia historical traditions.  They can be reached by telephone at 804-324-7813
 
(
Department of English, I believe).  Then I can also strongly recommend to you
 
Dr. Roderick Moore, Director of the Blue Ridge Institute at Ferrum College,
 
Ferrum, Virginia (
703)365-2121 . P
ie is an extremely competent and active scholar
 
of Virginia folklore and traditions.  I an sure any of the above three could
 
help you.
 
As a fellow resident of Virginia (Arlington) I ax sorry to say that Virginia is
 
one of the minority of states that does not have a Folk Arts Coordinator.  rerhaps
 
you could help encoura7e the Virginia Commission on t
he Arts to correct this
 
situation; t
he Folk !

ake the
 
liberty of enclosing
, one of our brochures for your i

Dear George;
 
'
`
.
you raise a slightly thorny issue (
who gets site visit reports).  Technically,
 
when we pay for them, they amount to in-house me
ar
tos and are thus not accessible
 
under s
tmmhiue laws and the like.  In general, we have simply left the circu-
lation  issue up to t
he site visitor; sometimes a visitor wants to have the
 
people see the report and sometines not.  You should feel quite free, then, to
 
send your report to Jay Anderson and/or the Plimoth Plantation i
f you choose
 
to; or let us know and we will do it for you.
 
However, in the cane of the Plimoth Plantation, there is an additional relevant
 
factor.  Most of our site visits are for purposes of grant evaluation; we had
 
never given these folks a Brent but I thought their problem was so special that
 
I said I
'd try to send someone competent up for a consultation. They may think
 
that you owe then a written report as a consultant in addition to whatever oral
 
discussious you had with thew.  That is not the case, and i
f you don't want then
 
to hwre your report you don't have to send i
t.  I a
sp sure you gave them what
 
good advice you might have had for them at the time, or perhaps you would be
 
willing to write them a special letter now (
all of this ase ainp you don't want
 
to give them your report).
 
The longer I writes the more =addled this letter becomes.  It's actually fairly
 
clear in my head, so perhaps you might given me a call next weep and we could
 
decide which of these possibilities would be the most appropriate?  I hope your
 
computer brings you much Joy.  We don't know quite what to do with ours, but I
 
trust someone will enlighten us soon.

Dear Facho:
 
I took your letter on a trip with me and managed to jot down a few notes on the
 
plane in between a couple of visits where: I hit the ground running . I will try
 
my best to be coherent in reconstructing what I felt at the time.
 
First, I urge you to involve your cultural consultants more in all stages of
 
film production —  scripting , shooting , and editing in particular.  As it
 
stands , they appear to be tacked on as something necessary to get a grant from
 
the Humanities Endowment , and they may get this impression , which won't c
oo
 
your budget any good , and the involvement of someone who really knows the music
 
could ensure that the film's contents are high quality and authoritative.  I
 
t
hink you went something that the musicians themselves would be proud o
f.. I got
 
the impression that you are using,
 your consultants largely to obtain entree to
 
people and places in 2
iexico.
 
I` you want to include the cuna de Is musics mariachera in your film, and I feel
 
it would be a great oveersi 6t if you�did not, you should plan to spend some time
 
and effort and film footage in and around Jalisco . Mexico City tends to attract
 
the more commercially-oriented musicians , since that's where the money is.
 
Your treatment stresses the development of a "set of symbols of national identity"
 
at t
he expense of other , perhaps equally important factors that had profound
 
affects on the marichi tradition -
-- professionaliaation of the musicians,
 
commercialization of the music, popularization of t
he wholes Jalisco ethos, for
 
example . Today, there are mariachi musicians f
rom regions where fifty years
 
ago mariachi was completely unknourz, street scenes with throngs of mariachi
 
musicians swarming over prospective clients in passing cars (a poignant reminder
 
of the mercilessly high unemployment rate)
, mariachis playing American C & W or
 
Herb Alpert songs for American tourists, while back in Jalisco, peasants still
 
play the old so ns the way they were before Silvestre+
 Vargas transformed theca
 
and froze t
hew for decades on a vinyl disc.  A
lso in Jalisco are local mariachi
 
competitions ,
 with good traditional groups blazing through so ns , rancheras, and
 
pieces in a more contemporary idiom in a way that puts citified groups to shame.
 
Another interesting insight is provided by the various small towns that are
 
historically important sources of musicians ,
 much in the way that Paracho was
 
made an instrument-making center and Fuebla a potte "Tmaking center by the Jesuits
 
in the 1
7th century.
 
I
 - 7
 
'
"
tie mariachi ensemble on one hand is reflective of a rapidly changing society and
 
or
. the other band a changing society that innovates but still retains its
 
integrity and keeps chat it likes.  Many songs from the 30's and 40's remain vero
 
much alive in the musical life of the Mexican people, in contrast to The United
 
States, where songs come and go at a much f
aster pace and the profit motive's
 
foothold in musical life is much more established, and the peoples are e
ncouraged
 
to use and discard songs as they would Kleenex tissues.
 
Your idea of interviewing a wide range of people is a good one, I think
., also
 
your plan to include footage of old films.  In fact, the history of mariachi in
 
film and the opposite dynamic of film on the mariachi could be an entire film in
 
itself.  Including interviews with old-timers who performed in the 30's could
 
be interesting.
 
You are looking for other consultants.  Hoedano is fine.  There is a young
, man
 
ua md Arturo Chaviorro in Michoacan who has done some fine work with rural
 
Michoacan musicians, a closely related style of music.
 
A sugnestion for an opening
, tune (
or at least to be included)-- the song entitled
 
"
vl Yariachi' .
 
Well, I have run out of gas for the moment.  I hope this does you some c
*ood;
 
I admire your persistence.

Dear, Jef
 f
 ,
 
As I should have explained before, once money has been a
llocated to a project,
 
it may be used only for the project described.  If the project does net happen,
 
the money returns to us if we claim it during the pertinent fiscal year.  After
 
that time, it returns to the: Treasury, not to the Endcwment.  The final date
 
has long since passed for us to lay cla ms on the money voted for the Massachusetts
 
fiddle festival.  Therefore -
-
-- and this has happened many times before -
-- the
 
Program ordinarily prefers: to be relaxed about recalling the money and will give
 
any number of bait extensions.
 
I assure you that other Programs handle these situations the sane way.  Generally
 
we save to cancel the project when absolutely all hope is goue. since we all
 
figure it's better to have some good quality project going on, even if radically
 
belayed, than lose the dollars from our modest bud?et ane return them to the Treasury.
 
I appreciate your totally natural Irritation with this issue and applaud your
 
efforts to get it resolved.  On the other hand, time is really no problem .
...
 
It costs us nothing .
...
 
Yours ever,

This is probably too long, but here it is anyway:
 
Folk Arts are generally learned through imitation -- or just by hanging
 
around and gradually absorbing the appropriate aesthetic styles and the customary
 
techniques.  Formal instruction is rare, the principal exception being the
 
occasional, casual, often temporary relationship between an older and a youn-
ger
 
artist that we sometimes bureaucratically call an "apprenticeship."  In our
 
efforts to encourage the passing on of the finest of our nation's traditional
 
artistic skills, the Folk Arts Program has long tried to encourage such
 
apprenticeships.  Currently, indeed, we are collaborating with interested State
 
Arts Agencies to develop their own locally based apprenticeship programs to
 
complement our smaller federal e£iart.
 
Some years ago, in the course of investigating how various kinds of
 
apprenticeships work in various places, we ran into the remarkable artisan,
 
philosopher, and organizer, Lance Lee.  At the time he was managing a program to
 
teach young woodworkers the complex and subtle arts of traditional wooden boat
 
manufacture at the Bath M
arine ?
Museum in :
Maine.  Since then, Lance has started
 
his own boatyard -- the Apprenticeshop -- complete with a crew of young
 
apprentices under the supervision of several experienced and seasoned craftsmen.
 
It is a superb effort in the old Yankee crafts tradition, informed by Lance's
 
far-reaching and searching mind and his extraordinary dedication to the job of
 
passing along an understanding and appreciation of the complex relationships
 
between beauty and function so clearly embodied in the hand-wrought wood  boats
 
of our maritime heritage.

Dear Dick:
 
I visited Rafael Cepeda last month at his home in Santurce, and during the
 
conversation I managed to work in a few pointed questions concerning his
 
donations to the Museum.  I pass them an to you in the following rather free--
flowing way.
 
Rafael Cepeda was born July 16, 1910 in Puerta de Tierra, a sector of the
 
municipality of Santurce, just adjacent, to the east, of San Juan.
 
The drum, called borAba (
the same word for the .
lance), was made about 30 years
 
ago (c. 1954) by don Rafael himself.  He said he e
vade it from scratch, barrel
 
and all.  The wood is noble (
oak), and the skin is female goatskin.
 (Isn't
 
there a word in English for ebiva?
) The distinction between the hides of make
 
and female "oats is an important one, the female hide is thought to be softer
 
and produce a different tone.  In fact, the other bomba drum is made with the
 
hide of the vale goat to wake for a sonoral contrast.  The pegs are fashioned
 
from the wood ausubo (
translated by a friend as `
'ironwood").  Their word flora
 
drum peg is cuna. _
 This
  particular type of bomb& drum is the buleador. It
 
is tuned to a deeper pitch than the other bomba, the requinto, (also, priao).
 
The buleador tends to play a repetitive rhythmic pattern that provides the
 
rhythmic foundation for each of the various types of bomba pieces.  The role
 
of the requiuto, then, is to improvise traditional and original patterns,
 
interrelating with the buleador pattern.  Very often, a solo dancer improvises
 
in a traditional manner, focussing his or her attention on the requinto drusamer,
 
in a manner challenging him to alertly and as sirwi
 taneously as possible play
 
sonoral
 -rhythmic patterns that complement the dance movements.
 
When I asked a question concerning the value of the drum, Cepeda explained that
 
the bomba drums were never bought nor sold.  They were always either made for
 
oneself or given as a gift to someone who deserves it, e
.g., a young
_
, drummer
 
who has shown talent and co=aitment at playing
.
,
. bombe.  His own father, *
tpdesta
 
Cepeda, gava him one that either he or has father, Cecilio Cepeda, had made.
 
In Cepeda's words, "el valor (of the drum) es respeto (
The value is respect).
 
t
ie pointed out that each solo dancer "hace una reverencia" (
bows) before the
 
drum as he or she takes the dance area, and that t
he bomba drum has great
 
value of this nature.
 
2
 
The panderetas (
tambourines, or fram drums) are, like the bombs drums, of
 
two varieties, the r
_
aquin
.to (
also,
 and seguidor (
Literally,` follower") .
 
The instrument d
onated t
o t
he Smithsonian is a saguidor, which, like the buleador,
 
is normally assigned the more repetitive and less improvisatory of the two
 
pandereta parts.  It was made by Jesus Cepeda, don Rafael's son, at the
 
Smithsonian Festival of A
merican '
Folklife in June of 1983.  Jesus was born on
 
December :
3
1 1,
1951.  The two panderetas provide the rhythmic core of the plena,
 
a complex of Puerto Rican music and dance forms popular since about the W M of
 
the century.
 
The gourd rasp donated by Cep©da is like the many gourd rasps made and sold
 
all over the island.  Cepeda bought it along with the pullero. or multiple
 
rasping stick.  The type of gourd is the marimbo, that apparently grows on
 
trees.  It is emptied of seeds after being dried, and then it is serrated.
 
Another terra often used for the rasping stick is varillero.
 
I hopes these few ethnographic tidbits are helpful.  Actually, it is boiled down
 
quite a bit from all that Cepeda had to say.  It would be most worthwhile to
 
speed some time with don Rafael recording onto tape some of his :
easy musical
 
experiences.  Maybe someday....
 
one other natter -- do you think it would be imprudent to ask Gary kulik to
 
address his letter to "Mr. Cepeds" or  Nr. Cepeda Atiles", rather than
 
,
jr. Atiles!"° I an certain it would sit better with him.  If I could have
 
the letter here by '
March 1
, I could give i
t to our Folk Arts panelist Rector
 
Vega, who could then hand deliver i
t to don ;
Rafael.  Or. i
f t
his is too soon,
 
I would be happy to send it to a friend in Puerto Rico, perhaps Rector, who
 
could deliver i
t.

Dear Betty,
 
This is by way of being a belated response to your letter of December 14.  The
 
statement you objected to in the Folk Arts guidelines was addressed to a still
 
not uncommon phenomenon; the com muity festival or event that suddenly decides
 
they would like to cash in on what they conceive of as an unlimited flow of
 
federal dollars and thus propose to us that we finance a huge and often
 
unrealistic sulas pAut of their rather pleasant old-timers day or whatever.
 
In fact, I resum er writing the sentence in question right after dealing
 
with a Chamber of Cowerce that wanted us to fund a balloon ascension at their
 
county fair; the nice W tleaan that proposed the idea pointed out that it
 
would really put their festival "on t
he map."
 
I certainly never thought to discourage the addition of a folk arts component to
 
a festival and a lot of people have applied for just :
such a project though such
 
an addition has be
e n only intermittently successful in our experience.  Sometimes
 
it has worked well and sometimes i
t has not, and the panel generally l
iens and
 
haws a bit but certainly doesn't rule the idea out of hand and certainly doesn't
 
want to.
 
Anyway, vis a via the guidelines, most of the people I consulted interpreted
 
the sentence the way I had intended but just to try to respond to your concern
 
while not raising any further questions, I added the word "solely" to the
 
sentence so that it will now read "We are especially reluctant to fund requests
 
solely to enlarge a
lready successful small community events."  I hope that will
 
help clarify the intent and at the same time allow for the creative addition
 
of folk materials of various kinds to recurrent events.
 
'
rho problem is that people who read guidelines are not always folklorists, as
 
you probably know even better than we do.  Thanks very :
such for the suggestion;
 
if this version still causes trouble, we'll try again neat year.  And again, thanks
 
for your help and concern.

Subject:  Five Year Plan Additions
 
On my return from New York this afternoon, I found several new sections to
 
the Five Year Plan.  One was headed Introduction (
2/2/84)$ another, Environment
 
(
1/31/84).  My reaction to these were t
Yiat they were not absolutely essential
 
for a planning document and that the Five Year Plan is already awfully long.
 
The last section I reviewed was the section on Public Policy.  I reccarm"d•
 
that the Public Policy Issues section either be left out or simply
 -
,
n-
-d
 
without additional comment.  These are extremely complicated problems that
 
require a lot of discussion for which there is now no time.,(I could critiqu
e
 
almost every one, but just can't do it right now and be ready for Council.)  It
 
seems to me that if the issues were simply listed with the statement that we
 
have explored them in the past and will continue to explore them in future,
 
that would be more appropriate.

Dear I
lan,
 
Thank you for your nice letter, and for the appreciation you expressed for the
 
program.  I do think we do a pretty good job, all things considered and
 
sometimes I feel bad that so few folklorists and ethnomusicologists really
 
understand the program.  Perhaps we can get a few more of the senior types on
 
the panel; I do think that helps.  I know Lynn Montell wants to be on, and I
 
shall nominate his as soon as Jay goes off; Alan keeps thinking that Jim
 
Peacock might be interested, but his interests seam a bit far removed, don't
 
you t
hink?  Also, Dan we are always being asked why we don't have more folk
 
artists on the passel.  I
've been cou=rting Mick as one as well as Nancy (which
 
is a bit of a cheat), and we have had, of course, Pete and Mike Seeger and
 
Jean Ritchie, but I wonder it there are not some others -- possibly some "
real"
 
ones -- that I
'm not t
hinking of.  Sny suggestions?
 
Here are the Southern Journey notes that I have.  I
t turns out that I don't
 
have all of them and t
he ones I have are wetly xeroxed indicating that I
 
ran into t
he same trouble that you did.  I am enclosing seven -- all I have
 
at
e. the attached list) and hope you can make some use of thee., ratty as they
 
are.  I know Alan was very disappointed with t
he Prestige Company for the
 
restrictive way t
hey Imndled t
he notes from the beginning, and I guess it's
 
possible they just didn't print some of them.  Perhaps a line to Alan would
 
fill in the remaining blanket

Since Folk Arts (
on ver;L rare occasions) has been known to register a mild
 
objection to some facet of admin. services, it seems only appropriate for
 
us to produce the odd bouquet or two as well.
 
The entire staff -- all six of us -- join in offering compliments and thanks
 
to the ladies who keep the seventh floor clean and tidy.  They are unbelievably
 
hard-working and accommodating; I do not believe I have ever worked in a building
 
where the shared facilities, such as bathrooms, were kept as consistently clean
 
and pleasant.
 
It is certainly possible that all the cleaning ladies are of the same calibre
 
as those on the seventh floor, and I hope that is true.  If so, I also hope
 
they all will be commended and t
hanked and given nice fat raises as soon as
 
possible.  They make our work hours much more pleasant than they might otherwise
 
be.

see, it's organized by state, and, under each state, by fiscal year, co to

Dear George,
 
Concerning the proposal for the Golden Door series, I have a few responses You
 
can put into your computer and shake around:
 
1)  I personally -- and this is just a personal feeling -- do not know of any
 
single film maker I would wait to back to film the performing traditions of
 
that many cultures.  It seems to t
ae that inevitably formulaic ideas and
 
responses would creep in.  To s
ae, the idea would be stt vnger if you were
 
proposing
, a consortium of film makers.
 
2
)  You nerd to do some more homevork, I believe, before you even send in the
 
basic idea, this is awfully value and you give the impression of not knowing
 
enough about the general issues of immigration or ethnicity.  You must also
 
clean up such details as spelling of scholars' names before you send anything
 
to rEH; alTwat half are misspelled including mine!
 
If you are going to discuss a single ethnicity as an example, be sure you
 
know s
nore aiaut it than just a fact or two -- you jumped ahead pretty fast,
 
it seems to as with such statements as "the: big bands of the urban centers
 
have had the greatest impact of any other Cuban art form".  That kind of
 
remark c
rakes s
ae think instantly "impact on whom?", and also makes me want
 
to call s few people and check that one out.  It may not b
e: wrong, you
 
understand, George, but it sounds kind of shallow and offhand.  And shat you
 
n
oted, I believe, in order to get federal money into such a series is an
 
indication of serious thought and planning.
 
Well, these are just my oven reactions.  As you know I liked both No Maps and

Dear Bill,
 
In accordance with the general policies of the '
National Endowment for the Arts,
 
the Folk Arts Program relies heavily upon the process of peer evaluation as the
 
key step in the awarding of grants.  Our advisory panels are rotating congre-
gations of distinguished and knowledgeable scholars, artists, and savants;
 
their independent recommendations to the Chairman ensure that our grants-caking
 
process is both honorable and responsive to the current state of the art.
 
The three year limitation on the terry of any panelist is probably wise, but
 
invariably hard on the
. Program staff, who come to rely upon senior panelists
 
for general advice and counsel.  As Program Director, I would like to say
 
that your particular contribution for the past three years has been exceptional,
 
and it makes the composition of this letter an especially difficult task.
 
I tAve especially relied upon your experience and perspective as a faculty
 
member of one of the
y centers of folklore training in the nation.  Your
 
breadth: of knowledge has been impressive, and we also benefitted from the
 
various site visits you made on our behalf.  I hope you will consent to
 
continue helping us in some capacity from time to time as the time permits.
 
I do rely heavily on the counsel of experienced former senior panelists
 
such as yourself.
 
Speaking both for the Frograu staff and t
he ongoing panelists, thank you for
 
yoru wisdom. your fairness, and your dedication during your past three years
 
of service on the Folk Arts advisory panel.  You will be sorely missed.  It
 
has been a real privilege to work with you.

Dear Mary Hays:
 
I am sorry that we were unable to speak directly about the NYSCA grant request
 
for a pilot apprenticeship project either before or after the folk Arts December
 
panel ueeting.  I had at first wanted to find out i
f the proposed elimination
 
of the folk Arts Coordinator position would entail a change in the proposed
 
project director (
Robert Baron); afterwards, I had wanted to tell you that the
 
Folk Arts panel had voted to defer consideration of the grant request until
 
the identity of the project director could be cleared up.  I hope Y
.athleen
 
O
'Connell reported our conversation on these points to you.
 
I should like to reiterate that the panel instructed r
ye to let you know about
 
the deferral of the grant request as soon as possible in order that,if the identity
 
of the project eirector were cleared up, I might be able to poll then before
 
the February National Council meeting so that the grant could go forward in a
 
timely fashion.  I was also to emphasize that the panel is concerned as to the
 
professional qualifications of project directors for all folk arts projects.
 
The applying agency is, of course, in complete charge
 of the selection of the
 
specific individual involved.  Use of part of the time of a full-time qualified
 
staffer as originally planned would be one way to go; direction by a trained
 
folk arts specialist on a contractual basis f
right also be acceptable.  The
 
Panel believes that folk arts activities in the state of N
ov York are so signi-
ficant that only a person of the highest experience and sophistication should
 
be selected to develop and supervise the project as outlined.
 
When the Folk Arts panel talks about "qualified professionals". it means
 
individuals with both academic and practical training in folklore, cultural
 
anthropology, ethnomusicology and/or similar disciplines, as well as with
 
experience in field work, administration, and the development of programs in
 
folk arts whether performing, literary, or visual.  Folk arts have far too
 
long been considered equivalent to ethnic and/or community arts.  They are
 
naither.  They represent one of the most rapidly growing aesthetic movements
 
in the nation, as evidenced by the fact that we now have established folk
 
arts programs, staffed by professionals, in 39 of the fifty states and regions,
 
several of them (
Utah, Florida and Ohio) with more than one full-time professional
 
in charge.  The Folk Arts Program is currently conducting a survey of state-based
 
folk arts programs which will be presented at the February Council meeting.

When the final results are prepared. I shall be happy to send you a copy.
 
It is within this context that I must tell you of g
ay personal disappointment
 
that you feel you =ust alissinate the folk arts position.  We have been through
 
this before, with Tennessee and Oregon, and I am unhappy to report that when
 
the arts council position is cut, folk arts activity drops.  This is too new
 
and fragile a field to stand unrepresented; when I tell you that upwards of
 
79 1% of our grants for folk arts activities go to non-folk arts organizations,
 
you will realise how flimsy an organizational structure we depend upon, how
 
few full-time advocates, how infrequent the voices that say that the traditional
 
arts should have a share in the action.  '
Vorse than that, quality declines when
 
there is no one in the granting
, mechanism that can both evaluate and explain.

Agencies in developing progr ms in the Folk Arts rather than putting; up funds
 
for support organizations and the like.  Generally our strategy has paid off;
 
more than half the folk arts coordinator positions in state arts a3encies now
 
are fully funded by the state allocations, leaving us in the pleasant position
 
of funding
; the many interesting projects that develop under their aegis.
 
I
'd really like to discuss this with you directly some time, and would certainly
 
be willing to come to Now York for a meeting if you would be interested.  We
 
had planner
) to bring kobert to the February Council to describe the New York
 
State folk arts program, but I guess that would be inappropriate now.  Please
 
let a
re know if you see any possibilities that we might explore together.  I
 
realize that you are in a difficult and disappointing situation but so are we.
 
Perhaps together we could come up with a solution that would help both of us.
 
Cordially,

I should like to suggest a discussion of the fellows program at a future P
.D.
 
meeting soon.
 
When I first joined the Endowment, the instructions were that interns were here
 
primarily for their own education and only incidentally to benefit the
 
Endowment by performing tasks we did not ordinarily have time to do.  We were
 
definitely not to rely on them for everyday functions.
 
During the past years of staff retrenchment and concurrent additional
 
responsibilities, it has become increasingly difficult not to depend upon
 
whatever manpower is available.  From our perspective reducing the fellows
 
budget and restricting the fellows program to summer and fall is a body blow.
 
We anticipate a truly gory spring and could face it with much more equanimity
 
with an extra hand.  I
'd be interested to see if other program directors share
 
my feelings and, if so, if we could not make an appeal for a reallocation of
 
admin moneys returning the fellowship program to a year-round status?
 
If we have to hold to two interns a year, we need spring and fall much more
 
than summer.
