William Hausinger

Born Nov 9, 1934. 5 years old moved close to ILA union hall. Watched it while growing 
up. Had a shoe shine box and used to set up near the offices during pay day, turned out to 
be a lucrative business. Only charged a dime but got good tips. At 18 stood in line to get 
a job. No seniority system. Button man means union member. Guaranteed a job over 
anything else. No automation. everything by hand. "Lamb back was a dirty job, cow hide 
was a stinky job." Tried to avoid such jobs. Had one four year break due to medical 
reasons. Worked for 32 years. Had side jobs when there was no work.  
 
05:00 
No containers. Commodities and household goods would be lifted out of the ship hatch 
cover and loaded out on the dock or vice versa.  Worked Clerk and time keeping for last 
25 years. 
Worked in hold of ship for the first 7 years.  
 
10:00 
Rotation on cotton jobs only.  Every man working the cotton job would draw the same 
salary. Good cotton gang would know one another. Know the system, then welcome to 
work in any gang. Cotton bales had buckles on them with wires that were sharp and could 
cut. Had protective layering on while working with cotton. Cotton wit 600-700 bales was 
a coveted job.  
 
13:10 
New comers. Kinship and friendship job. These days it is called networking, those days 
was just called kinship. Did not pull anyone down. Needed to know someone to get in. 
While hiring it was button men first. 1969 started seniority system. Union advantage of 
being a button man changed. While hiring it was button men first. Anybody could work 
and get in the union. Hiring a gang foreman or picking up a gang.  
Early days there was a man who made ice water. His tools were an icepick. Been there 
30-40 years. Took care of old timers then.  
 
 
 
17:00 
Gang numbers used to vary according to the job. Commodities were loose back then and 
then they started to be wrapped up in plastic. Worked to the bottom of the hole, called the 
skin of the ship. Worked down a layer at a time.  
 
20:00 
Gangs would stay together. The outsider was getting a start like anyone else. "Partner's 
progress." Retired since 1990.  
 
23:00 
Non-union shops were always known as Scabs. There were non-union jobs available. 
Port of Houston does not allow its docks to be completely used by non-union labor.  
 
25:00 
Nobody broke a picket line when organized by labor. The only people who crossed the 
picket line were "the ladies of the night." There were some fights when people had other 
jobs. Fights on the waterfront were a lot of times because of jealousy and sometimes 
because non-union labor was working in a particular dock. Union also has to police itself. 
If there are certain people who don't tow the union's line or continually get job abuse 
written up they are retrained, warned or fired. Don't want anyone harming the union or 
Port of Houston's reputation.  
 
29:00 
Common prank. To buy a Longshoreman's manual. Was asked to buy beer at midnight. 
Drinking was rampant then. Worked together always. Did socialize after the job. There 
were certain clubs that we frequented. In 1990, did not socialize as much. Do keep in 
touch and attend retiree meetings. Hoping to get a museum in Houston, trying to lobby 
Port Commissioners for the museum.  
 
35:20 
Compared to manual labor, clerks and checks only lifted a pencil. Need to make sure job 
was well done and reached the right place. Lot of responsibility and had a lot of 
paperwork.  
Women in ILA. Women did not want to get a job in the hold. They took a dock checking 
job to check cargo loads on trucks for quantity, damages etc. It was accepted. They were 
as good workers as the men, sometimes even better.  
 
37:30 
Unions were integrated on April 1, 1983. Checkers hall was always inter-racial. Deep sea 
longshoreman, stevedores were separate. Stood together in the hall as union brothers. 
Had an equal chance at getting a job. in the old days, Ship was divided in half. First half 
went to the white locals and the second half went to the black. On the next ship it was 
 
 
vice versa. So it was pretty equal then. Did away with that system in 1983 when the 
integration happened. Will Call, available when you need to be. Not a fixed time job. 
Seniority keeps the same level. Timekeeper job had a lot of responsibility. When foreman 
notices the time keeper is not there, he has to fire him,  
 
44:00 
Worst accident. Saw big forklift with tons of steel back up over a man's leg. Chief on the 
ship is the first doctor. Chief mate is the pharmacist mate on the ship. Containers squash 
two men on deck.  
FBI incident. 
Customs are the Gods of the waterfront. Nothing loads or unloads without customs 
approval. Check every ships paper work, people on it, what they are transporting.  
 
48:50 
Wife got job at coast wire shipping. Company turned out to be Sea Land company. First 
ship came with 20 containers. That was the start. Late 60s containerization really took 
off. Been to Saudi Arabia 7 times with shipping companies. Clerk and timekeepers. 20-40 
containers an hour. Container royalty fund. Not as many new hires coming in. Fund that 
helps pick up difference every year. Great hospitalization plan.  
 
53:20 
Used to have papers ready within an hour of either direction. When they gang comes on 
and off the ship gave them piece of paper saying how much money they made , didn't 
have to wait, could go to the union hall and hand it in. If there was some problem, union 
hall would contact the walking foreman on the ship. 
 
55:40 
New people are so glad to get a job they will do their best. Union has education programs 
and safety programs and is continually educating new comers. Have tests and exams for 
computer literacy. Have to be computer literate, container qualified.  Will always need 
people, even with automation and containerization. Losing a lot of labor is a far-fetched 
thought.  
 
59:30 
Wife liked the steady job of a firefighter. Was always reluctant to think there is no steady 
income from the waterfront. There is no guarantee. Always made it. Proud of benefits. 
Left City of Houston job after 21 years, got nothing. Son works at the Port as a clerk. 
Two daughters work for stevedores and company, son is chief clerk, other son puts up 
construction elevators. Whole family has worked on the port. Loved being a 
longshoreman. Different job every day, different people.  
 
1:03:12 
 
 
Worked 62 hours a week at the fire station. Then started work as a dispatcher for 40 
hours a week. Started working at the port. Love the waterfront. Had a shrimp boat on the 
side.  
rebuilt a 10 year old shrimp boat. Caught as much 1700 pounds in one day. Helped with 
the living. In the last 5-10 years just nobody can come and make a living in the first year 
itself. Have to do something else as supplemental income. Need to be able to leave the 
other job whenever the union hall calls. Women working in the hold of the ship. Never 
been approached to do anything illegal.  
 
1:11:38 
Visited a lot of ports. Socialize with people at other ports. Hiring time was 7, 8, 10 and 1 
pm. Would play dominos waiting to be hired. Seining in Galveston. Have had the 
opportunity to work at the fire station close to the port. Certified welder. Retired as 
Deputy Chief from the fire dept. all had secondary jobs, house builders, fire fighters, 
concrete pourers, jewelry store owners.
