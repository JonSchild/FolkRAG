Oh, you talk about your travels and something good to eat. 
Of all the bum hash houses there is one on Clark street; 
The bill would set you loony, and paralyze your feet. 
Your tongue it would go crazy and fall out in the street. 
Roosters' spurs in jelly, Bull frogs' toes in wine, 
Elephants' tongues in sawdust, Tom cats baked in lime; 
Oysters stuffed with monkeys, fried in powdered steel, 
I'd rather be a 
young girl's pet than tackle such a 
meal. 
Second-handed hash house, old galvanized beds, 
Electric tallow candles burning overhead; 
Mosquitos chasing with a 
lively flea, 
Dancing in the Pinafore and singing let me be. 
0117- 
the next day came on Sunday, everything looked neat, 
We had parrot soup with chilblains, of course that was a 
treat; 
Duck tail roast with bull dogs, elephant's ears on toast, 
Indian- rubber doughnuts, of course there was a 
dose; 
There was freckle-headed lobsters, and salivated clams, 
Magnesia, horse tongue, all done up in a 
jam; 
The boarders all got moon struck, like pigs they all did 
squeal, . 
And Bred the cook out in the street for cooking such a 
meal. 
Old galvanic butter, frozen reed birds' ears, 
Water baked in dish pans too dirty to appear; 
Bloated apple dumplings, fly's wings mixed wit h 
fleas 
It's the wickedest house I 
ever struck, it gave 118 all the 
heaves.

GAUGER PILL-GARLIC. 
(Parody on Major Gilfeather.) 
Written by EDWIN TALBOT for, and sung by Andy Collom, the only 
Banjo March Player in the world.

Oh! freckled face Gauger Pill-garlic, 
The bummers and loafers all cry; 
They say use your head for a 
bucket, 
And smother yourself in mince pie; 
They say you're the worst in creation, 
A 
free lunch you'd tackle without fear; 
A 
station house is a 
great recreation, 
And this is the slang you will hear. 
CHORUS: 
A 
sixer for the Gauger Pill-garlic, 
For working a 
servant girl's pocket; 
He thought he'd go off on a 
racket, 
And drink with the money quite free. 
A 
copper nabbed him by the collar 
And said " give that girl every dollar; 
In Sing Sing I'll give you a 
parlor, 
And you can't crack a 
crib any more." 
The tramp and the political bummer 
Has a 
nose that from rum brightly shines; 
And never does hard work ever bother them, 
And they're always complaining of the times. 
With a 
tomato can and a 
stick in their pocket, 
On the watch for new kegs of stale beer; 
Oh! a 
bar-room with a 
fire in the Winter 
Gives a 
gauger a 
jolly old steer.

GAUGER PILL-GARLIC— CONTDMED. 
CHORUS: 
Then where is the Gauger Pill-garlic, 
his face it would give you the colic; 
I 
think he's gone off on a 
frolic 
With a 
man by the name of Rooney. 
He's drinking champagne in the poor house, 
And feeding on feather weight hash; 
They say he's gone off with Brother Talmage, 
And with Beecher and Elizabeth to mash. 
Oh! jailers and coppers all know him, 
A 
staff once he was on the press; 
Ten cents for a 
ball he does owe me, 
And he gives me a 
puff of his breath. 
He says he is tired of mashing, 
The girl that he had acted queer, 
He searched for her all over Blackwell's Island. 
And he fotind her with a 
ball and chain on her ear. 
CHORUS: 
Then cheer up old Gauger Pill-garlic, 
Brace up and get full of stale beer, 
Join a 
circus, hire out as a 
toothpick, 
And sit on the sharp edge of a 
spek 
Dennis Kearney is looking for labor, 
Parnell he's the ladies' fond dear; 
Old Ireland we'll never forget you, 
The country that we love most dear. 
In My Backyard there Dwells a 
Cat.

In my backyard there dwells a 
cat, 
In my backyard there dwells a 
cat. 
And his nibs is very fat ; 
He watched four years for a 
bob-tail rat, 
He tore in two my high silk hat. 
He is lazy, he is crazy, lazy, crazy, 
He is a 
tramp. 
He is husky, is musty, 
His ears they are musty, 
His name is McClusky, 
He is very fond of beer. 
He is a 
snoozer, a 
boozer, 
All night he is a 
cruiser, 
The butchers they are losers, 
Who live both far and near. 
In the daytime he sleeps in the sun, 
In the daytime he sleeps in the sun, 
And you can bet he is full of fun; 
His teeth is loose from chewing gum, 
His nose is blue from drinking rum. 
He is a 
howler, 
A prowler, and a 
me-owler, 
Lives on clam chowder, paint and powder, 
He is a 
bum. 
When the stars are beaming, 
This Tomcat is screaming, 
The neighbors they are dreaming, 
And pull their hair with fright. 
Bootjacks and pistols, 
Policemen's clubs and missiles, 
This cat does always whistle 
As he flies through the air. 
Sung by ANDY COLLOM. A parody by " Den Morton." 
Scarface Susan Johnson, a 
hunky dory wench, 
Her parents were Zulus, yet Susan says she's French; 
In a 
kitchen she's a 
hasher, and Thompson Street must 
know, 
I'm her steady masher, I'm scarface Susan's beau. 
CHORUS: 
Scarface Susan Johnson, she's a 
ducky dear, 
Every day at dinner she swipes a 
keg of beer; 
She caused the Irish famine, she'll ruin me I 
know, 
-Yet her I'll have to marry, for I'm Scarface Susan's beau. 
She's a 
colored angel, you ought to see her feet, 
Standing on the side- walk, they reach across the street; 
iler tongue would make an ulster, and it's always on 
the go, 
Yet still I 
dearly love her, for I'm Scarface Susan's 
beau.

(4: 4, 
Cross.eyed scarface Susan, she sometimes makes me cry, 
She often has erected a 
French flat on my eye; 
I 
sometimes try to shake her, but she will not let Inc go, 
Though I'd rather b3 a 
quaker, or a german bretzel baker, 
Ora, hook-nosed sheeny baker, or a 
clunese undertaker, 
Yet my wife I'll have to th-ike her, 
For I'm Sean ace Susan's Oeau. 
CHORUS. 
Scarface Susan Johnson, ain't she got a 
craw, 
She'd chew an iron fence-rail if she got it in her jaw; 
Her mouth would makua cellar, where a 
ton of coal could 
go, 
Still I 
think her handsome, for I'm Scarface Susan's beau. 
Scarface Susan Johnson, ain't she got a 
gaul, 
She waltzes on her eye- brow at every colored ball; 
When they see her stockings, the ladies cry oh! oh! 
And say I 
ought to wash them, for I'm Scarface 
Susan's beau. 
Composed and sung by ANDY COLLOM. 
When I 
was a 
lad I 
was an unfortunate kid, 
I 
used to get a 
licking for everything I 
did; 
The old man would take me and lay me cross his lap, 
While he used upon me the old leather strap. 
CHORUS. 
Across his knee so gently 
he'd make me holler murder when he'd— 
Oh! that pain I 
cried in vain, 
Holy Moses General Hickory Jackson how it. 
I 
remember well at school when hooky I 
did play; 
When I 
came home to dinner, there would be the 
deuce to pay; 
Up in the little attic once more he'd make me prance, 
With that old leather strap he wore holes through 
my pants. 
So I 
thought of an idea and I 
soon improved the chance 
Says I 
go it easy pop or you'll bust my Sunday pants. 
l'he old man paused a 
moment, then he raised the strap 
aloft,

Then once more he'd make me sore, 
I 
used to holler murder when he'd— 
Oh! that pain went through my frame,

ANDY COLLONS LARDY DAR. 
Composed and sung by ANDY CoLLom, the banjoist at 
the " London," New York. 
I 
know a 
little snoozer, 
Lardy dar, lardy dar, 
lie wants to be a 
bruiser. 
Lardy dar, lardy dar, 
The girls give him a 
stear, 
And he puts up for the beer, 
But the girls say he is queer, 
Lardy dar, lardy dar, 
And they stand him on his ear, 
Lardy dar. 
Cum :us. 
For he mashed a 
little dizzie on the street. 
Lardy dar, 
And he asked him to treat, she's on the beat. 
Lardy dar, 
lie thought her extra tine, 
When she called for quail and wine, 
But the hill it knocked him blind, 
Lardy dal-, lardy dar, 
For he could not come to time, 
Lardy dar. 
He goes to all the parties and the balls. 
Lardy dar, 
He cannot dance at all, 
Lardy dar, lardy dar, 
He hops around the floor, 
When the boys at him do roar, 
Fire that shadow out the door, 
Lardy dar, lardy dar, 
On the girls he's a 
regular bore,

Parody on an Old. Wooden Rocker, 
Composed and sung with success in all the principM Theatres in the 
United States, by A NDY CoDLost. 
Oh, its well do 1 
remember, and to you I 
will tell, 
Of the old wooden rocker, you all know so well; 
But you bet I 
don't forget it, there's a 
secret you must know 
I 
have often damned the rocker and the old man, just so. 
One morning he did bounce me and he raised me through 
the door, 
And you bet I 
seen a 
thousand stars I 
never seen before; 
Jthst then old granny seized me, on her knee she made me 
dance, 
As she laid the paddle on me she wore holes clean 
through my pants. 
CHORUS. 
As she raised up her hand she would rap, rap, rap, 
And you bet I 
caught the devil from that strap, strap, 
strap, 
Oh, she laid it on so lovely that my poor heart would swell 
In that old wooden rocker you all know so well. 
They bounced me out in the morning, before the roosters 
crow, 
To catch worms for th 
sparrows and frighten off the 
crows; 
Then I 
gat drunk on cider, through the bunghole it was 
nice, 
I 
set a 
hen on snowballs to see her hatch out. ice. 
I 
tried to ride a 
jackass, when he kicked me in the jaw, 
And you bet I 
saw a 
thousand stars I 
never saw before; 
Just then old granny seized me, on her knee she made me 
fall, 
And she busted my suspenders, in that rocker by the wall.

I 
am a 
hard working man that's fond of good living, 
I've a 
fair education that's to say I'm no fool; 
Some very hard problems of late I've been solving, 
But I 
can't understand that game they call Pool; 
You pick up your cue and rub it with chalk, 
And you fool around the table like an over-grown galk; 
You first make a 
scratch and that sets you crazy, 
And if you keep it up you get terrible lazy; 
How you are stuck every game you can never suspect, 
Until you get humpback from carrying checks. 
It costs a 
small fortune when you first learn the game, 
You walk round the table until you get lame; 
There's some that get cross-eyed and others humpbacked, 
And others you will see do a 
contortion act; 
Now there's some sleeps on a 
pool table, 
To play a 
good game he will never be able; 
He is played for a 
sucker always get beat, 
And from walking he is got bunions all over his feet; 
If he takes my advice he'll not be a 
fool, 
And spend all his salary to learn to play pool.

There is a 
young man and he lives in our town, 
his name is Adolphians de Anthony Brown; 
Among weak-minded females he gains much renown; 
This sweet scented, handsome young man, 
He's bright as a 
butterfly, his collars are gay, 
He flutters from corner to corner each day; 
He's too sweet for anything that's what all the girls s.xy, 
This sweet scented, handsome young mail 
ClIORITS. 
He wears a 
red necktie, his complexion is fair, 
Right down the middle he parts his brown hair; 
He skips all the glitters like a 
thing made of air, 
This sweet scented, handsome young man. 
He has a 
few hairs right on his upper lip, 
His legs are the size of a 
two cent tallow dip, 
He looks like a 
chicken who has just had the pip, 
This sweet scented, handsome young man. 
If caught in the rain he would surely expire, 
Got up expressly for girls to admire; 
He can jump through a 
seive without touching the wire, 
This sweet scented, handsome young man.

UNSOPHISTICATED LOVE. 
—: 
0 :— 
Written by the only Poet in the world, ANDY COLLOM. 
-:
:-
The girl that I 
love is both tall and serene, 
Her teeth are bran new, and her cheeks are so green: 
Her voice is as sweet as the tones of a 
mule, 
Her uncle's a 
sailor, her brother's a 
fool. 
She can chew all day long on a 
big hunk of gum, 
Like a 
freckled-face boy with a 
wart on his thumb; 
Her appetite's good; she'd devour with great ease, 
A couple of tons of old limburger ch eese, 
Cnottus: 
She had a 
great love for the new silver dollar, 
She looks like a " fairy" in a 
clean paper collar; 
When she opens her head, the inside can be seen, 
No taffy at all, she's a 
lovely sardine. 
She owns a 
big farm where the bull-frogs do grow, 
She raises a 
crop of the best kind of snow, 
I 
sent her my picture dressed in my best togs, 
She put it in the sty for to frighten the hogs. 
She wears a 
glass eye, and its color is red, 
With a 
big bunch of feathers attached to her head; 
She can talk broken China in seventeen tongues, 
And blow down a 
house with her cast-iron lungs. 
I 
never can tell all her beauties at once, 
She calls me her sugar-coated galvanized dunce; 
When she kisses me with her big mouth open wide, 
There's room enough in it for an elephant to hide. 
If "he ever gets mad, she'll pulverize your jaw 
With one little swipe of her delicate paw; 
What shall I 
say of her gaiters to wear? 
It takes forty big cow-skins to wake her a 
pair.

Composed by A.NDY Co',tom, and sung by him with great success. 
Now Gabriel he has got a 
mighty power, 
He ' ranges everything for us to day; 
When he'll toots that silver horn for us to-morrow, 
Why then all the niggers want to pray; 
And if you are caught sleeping on the roadside, 
You can bet he'll pass you by and let you go; 
Then the devil with his rake and pitchfork, 
Will shove you in that hot house down below. 
Cnonus. 
Composed and sung by ANDY CoLLoNt with great success at " Miner's 
Theatre" and the " London ." 
Then wake up Simon don't you get left, 
For the devil he will never pass you by., 
He stick you on his tail and he run you through by 
rail, 
And he land you in that sweet by-and-by. 
Now the colored people all go to glory, 
And the white folks all stay down below; 
The Italians and the Chinaman go to the devil, 
For there's where all cheap labor ought to go. 
So if you want to ride in the chariot, 
You better try and change your color soon, • 
Or else you'll have a 
thousand of young devils, 
Bouncing you up in a 
balloon.

BABY LEFT A 
CRADLE. 
Air :—" Empty is the Cradle Baby's Gone." 
Empty is the bar the dutchman fired the bums, 
The cop is snoring loudly on his beat, 
The lager keg is busted the lunch was all chewed up, 
Except some second-handed old pigs feet; 
The gang has all skedaddled and carried off the plates, 
Others up to sing sing now have flown, 
The rest are in the workhouse where no lager they get, 
For empty is the keg the beer is gone. 
Cnottus. 
Empty is the plates, vanished is the hash, 
The moldy cheese and liverworst has flown, 
The smell of old limburger haunts the place T1 o 
more 
For empty is the bar the beer is gone. 
They get the dutchman crazy when he goes to sleep, 
He scares the rats around him with his snore, 
He's dreaming of the boys who stood him off for drinks, 
And swears he'll never trust again some more; 
But now the place is busted, the bums are in the park, 
Skirmishing with the sparrows for a 
bed; 
On the bench you hear the call let's have another ball, 
But empty is the bar the dutchman's dead.

One day hist week I 
gave my love a 
treat, 
To Chestnut Grove we did go; 
The picnic was there, and the weather was fair, 
And all of the gang she did know. 
They were dancing around, playing (Tames on the 
eTound, 
When her face got, read as a 
rose; 
This dizzy young thing, she got up on the swing, 
And fell off and busted her nose. 
CHORUS: 
Oh, Andy, tell them to stop, 
That was the cry of Sophia; 
The rope it did slip, and busted her lip. 
And the swing went a 
darned sight higher. 
She's a 
darling, you bet, and I 
never forget, 
Her heel hit me plump in the eye; 
I 
fell on the ground and busted my crown, 
Oh, Andv. my dear, let me fly. 
I 
pushed her so I

Old uncle Pete had a 
dream last night, 
Looking out the window.he saw a 
sight, 
All about a 
story I 
am going to tell, 
Will make you all feel so well. 
Chicken in the hen-roost dancing juber, 
Monkey in the garden playing base, 
Ducks and the gander and old grey nag, 
Singing in the chorus rally round the flag. 
Owls in the tree winking, blinking, 
Cats in the pantry chasing mice, 
Bugs in the attic playing poker, 
Spider in the cobweb shaking die. 
Chicken in the henroost drinking egg nog, 
Pig double shuffle in the sty, 
Massa swearing at the skeeters. 
Bald headed spiders coaxing flies. 
Behind the hen- house on my knees, 
1 
thought I 
beard a 
rooster sneeze, 
Sneezed so hard with the hooping cough, 
Sneezed his head and tail both oft: 
Elephant up a 
gum- tree smoking his pipe, 
Bug in swimming bawling for life. 
Sally in the garden sifting peas, 
Come and kiss n!,

I 
have a 
darling whom I 
adore, 
When he is near I 
am sighing no more : 
Lone are the hours when we are apart, 
Fondly his image now dwells in my heart. 
Sweet hours of gladness we pass side by side, 
Waiting the day when I'll be his bride; 
Dearly he loves me, but never in vain, 
Soon he is coming to kiss me again. 
CHORUS. 
Kiss me again and say that you love me. 
Ever my darling remain; 
Kiss me again, and if I 
complain, 
Say that you love me and kiss me again. 
Sweet is the kiss that lovers can share, 
How it will cheer you and banish all care 
Never refuse one, never be shy, 
Don't be too bashful and scream out " Oh, my!" 
Kisses are plenty and kisses are sweet, 
When you take one the dose you'll repeat; 
If with your lov'd one you'd always remain, 
Come to his side and say, " kiss me again !" 
Kiss me again, etc. 
Parody ox Kiss Me Again. 
Sung by Andy Collum, 
I 
sat down one night on an old cellar door, 
Around the corner in front of a 
Dutch grocery store, 
Thinking of home, and my clothes all in hock, 
When suddenly I 
experienced a 
terrible shock, 
The door gave away and unlucky I 
fell, 
I 
bursted my pantaloons and undergarments as well, 
I 
struck on my head on the hard cellar floor, 
And the proprietor bounced me up through the door. 
CHORUS. 
He kicked me again in the bosom of my pants, 
Which made my stomach feel queer, 
He kicked me again and because I 
complained, 
Out on the sidewalk I 
walked on my ear. 
Kicks are a 
thing that all bummers can get, 
If they hang around saloons and cigar stores you bet, 
They are always given freely and don't cost a 
cent, 
And the place that you get them are sure to be bent, 
If once you get landed out into the street, 
You 'hardly would care the dose to repeat, 
Boot toes have nails in and makes you feel sore, 
Aud always are ready to kick you once more. 
He kicked me again, (te.

I 
big banana peel I've s,;en you before, 
Your cognon is banana from a 
far distant shore, 
I've heard of you often and what you have done. 
They say you are awful and have lots of fun. 
You lay on the walk so cunning and so sly, 
And tackle the first gauk who chance pass you by, 
He treads on you lightly and comes down with a 
l'OAr, 
1 big banana peel you've busted my jaw. 
I 
big banana peel I've seen you before, 
You false-hearted wretch you've deceived me to the cure. 
When last I 
did meet you my crystal you did crack. 
You busted my bugle and near broke my back, 
A 
charming young damsel by chance you do meet. 
Is forced to dissolve from under her big feet, 
She rises like an angel and fills like a 
lamb. 
I 
big banana peel you've showed all my gams. 
I 
big banana peel of you I 
want no more, 
You are long, lean and lanky from a 
far distant shore. 
Your skin has turned yellow and slips like an eel. 
My pants and suspenders your kindness did feel, 
A 
strawberry blonde on you lightly does tread, 
Revolves in the air and comes bang on her head, 
My corset strings you've busted and whalebones you've 
sprung, 
I

Come gather you snoozers to you I 
will tell. 
Of a 
lunch route I've found out that will make your head swell, 
Three kinds of soup, there you can get every day, 
Noodle boodle, dumbee doodle, kindle they say, 
It is one, two and three, four, they will stand in a 
line, 
Getting away with lunch, for they never lose time, 
More bread, more bread, one bum you'll hear cry, 
When the bar tender hits him a 
smash in the eye. 
To-morrow they change for a 
better lunch route, 
Get mnstard and cehese and dutch sour-krout, 
fled herring, and bologna, and meat so they say, 
Pluck liver and lights boys, dont give it away, 
It's one, two and three, glass of beer at a 
time, 
They swell his nobs head, till he nearly looks blind, / 
More beer, more beer, the bums they will roar, 
When the dutchman he fires them right out the front door.

BY-WORDS. 
As sung with success, on the Banjo, by ANDY 
There's many an old saying heard, 
Most everywhere you go; 
And I 
propose to mention some, 
And pick on the old Banjo. 
The subject I 
have chosen is, 
The By-Words of the day ; 
So just drop on my racket. 
And you'll tumble to my lay. 
Cuonus. 
Won't you ever tumble ? 
Won't you ever drop ? 
Nixey, Culley, cheese it; 
I'll go and call a 
cop! 
One, two, three, now boune him, 
Or hit him with a 
mop! 
Of course, I 
had to tumble, 
But still I'd never drop! 
If you're talking to a 
pretty girl, 
A 
friend goes by and sees it. 
He's always sure to holler out - 
I 
say, young fellow, cheese it ! 
The greeting you will now receive, 
If seen with a 
bad silk hat, 
is, shoot it. take it off, Old Boy, 
The bells have rung for that!

Board bill mine, yes in time,

If my board I

Board bill mine, board bill mine. 
They nailed my trunk to-day, 
Board bill mine, yes so fine, 
For fear I 
jumped away, 
They're so kind, board bill mine, 
My clothes they are all right, 
Out the window they were dropped last night, 
While the old dame she was tight, 
Board bill mine, board bill mine. 
And with her I 
had to fight, 
Board bill mine, board but mine. 
She looked for me next day, 
Board bill mine, board bill

Of a

By a 
wicked minded man who carried a 
gun for Uncle Sam, 
lie belongs to a 
regiment you all know well, 
To speak his name I 
am afraid to tell, 
For he looks so fair, with his light brown hair, 
And belongs to the National Guards.

He marched I 
am told in the Nation- 
al Guard so bold, 
T1-- girls all say oh don't he look so gay, 
V ie 
boys look so bright, shout out with all their might, 
hurrah, hurrah, hurrah for the National Guard. 
He took me to a 
picnic one day, 
And left me there for a 
girl called My, 
And when I 
was on the ground, 
Neither of them could be found, 
I 
heard he served other girls the same. 
Now boys can you guess his name, 
And he looks so fair with his light brown hair, 
And he belongs to tho, National Guards.

The boot-blacks on the corner at leisure did play, 
They all looked up and saw me by chance.

I 
took my girl to the ball last night, 
The gang on the floor commenced for I

My daisy got drunk and they slugged her by chance, 
For mashing a

Now all you young blokes take a

You'll go to the parks and you will meet them by chanoe, 
But beware of the daisy who wears fringe on her over-ails, 
BANJO SOLO. 
As sung by ANDY Comom, at TONY Pewron's, B'way, N 
There was a 
young man who never had his health, 
He was subject to all kinds of ills ; 
He went down in town on Sunday afternoon, 
And bought a 
box of Vegetable Pills. 
He took twenty-six, and then he went to bed, 
And soon he was fast asleep 
And to his surprise when he open'd up his eyes, 
He was turned to a 
big dead-beat. 
SPOKEN.—That's the reason, Ladies and Gentlemen, you 
should never partake of those luxuries commonly called 
Vegetable Pills— 
CHORUS. 
Y. 
For if you do, surely you'1 rue it, 
Though strange to you it seems, 
For how funny you would look, all strung upon a 
hook, 
And all turned into beans. 
The old woman was taken with a 
pain in her head, 
And she sent for her darling Lou; 
She says, go bring me that same box ox pills, 
And I 
think I 
shall try some too. 
But the pills made her worse, when she sent for the nurse; 
After taking in a 
great big number, 
When she look'd in the glass she was just as green as grass, 
She had turned to a 
big cucumber! 
For if you do, &c. 
Now the old pussie cat was looking for a 
rat, 
When she spied that box of pills; 
She was looking all around when she gobbl'd them down, 
She thought they would cure all her ills ; 
But then the fun begun when the cat began to run 
From the cellar clear up to the garret; 
And her body it turned to a 
barrel of sour krout, 
And her tail it turned into a 
carrot !

said before, Ladies and Gentlemen—

Now if you've no objection, I'll sing you something now 
Of this and that and other things, and every word is true, 
Now Irish Whisky, or Lager Bier, or good old Holland Gin,

Then wake up fellows, we're bound to put her through, 
It's funny how we do it, but you bet your pile we do; 
Rip, rap, flip, flap, jump right up and break your back,

GET TREE GONE, JANE, 
composed and sung by Andy Collura, 
As I 
was reading the bulletin last night, 
A 
very strange item on it caught my sight, 
About a 
red headed damsel who demoralized a 
cletir, 
Around the block she would hang when he was at work, 
She always would watch, on him have an eye, 
And she vowed she would fix him, and have him or die, 
When she went to embrace him he would bawl out so strong, 
Get thee gone, Jane, get thee gone, Jane, but Jane would not 
get thee gone. 
She arose very early down town she would go, 
In search of her darling and that you must know, 
She would roost on the corner in his window she'd look, 
And see her own baby perusing his books, 
And when he'd go home from his work every night, 
She would seize his coat tail and there have a 
fight, 
Oh, she would cry, oh, dear George, and to her he would aay, 
Get away, Jane, get away, Jane, but Jane wouldn't get away. 
He is worried to death and looks like a 
rail, 
By this damsel who sticks so close to his coat tail, 
She hollers out murdet, in the streets she will cry; 
When he hits her a 
smash right over the eye, 
She bawls out police, and away he does fly, 
Leaving her nibs with a 
pair of black eyes, 
The gang on the corner they will all give a 
cough, 
Get thee off, Jane, get thee off, Jane, but Jane don't get thee of 
As Sung by JOHNNY ROACH

left my native land, in search 
Of wonders I 
would go: 
I

I

A 
Turk and Chimpanzee.

A 
dreadful storm arose: 
Upon an island I 
was threwn, 
To wind and rain exposed, 
By savages sorrounded: 
(It was their island home,) 
They addressed me in a 
language, 
Decidedly their own. 
Jamsetjhee, Inn jalutjenoy, 
I 
expected from these savages, 
Less pence than kicks and blows, 
They'd a 
funny dress, in fact they'd not 
A 
single stitch of clothes. 
They tore my things from off my back, 
My hair from out the roots, 
They left me with a 
waistcoat, 
A 
hat and pair of boots.

WHIST ! WHIST 
As sung by LESTER & W ILLIAMS. 
Such a 
lot of dizzy fairies every day you'll meet, 
Forty-five cent switches on their heads, no stockings 
on their feet; 
Living on free lunches and clam chowder, 
Their cheeks and faces disfigured with common paint 
and powder. 
You're a 
brick, whist, whist, 
You make me sick, whist, whist, 
Oh, pull up your skirts and run around the 
park; 
Give him a 
brace, whist, whist, 
Poison face, whist, whist, 
Is what those dizzy maidens all remark. 
While seated with a 
fairy and enjoying the breeze, 
Of the kidney stew and liver and limburger cheese, 
When in a 
bruiser came and said, young fellow, this 
looks queer, 
If you don't let my girl alone, I'll bite your ear. 
CHORUS: 
Up I 
got, whist, whist, 
Away I 
shot, whist, whist, 
And they sat down at the table with a 
whist, 
whist, whist; 
So if you're flip, whist, whist, 
Always skip, whist, whist, 
When a 
bruiser comes to claim his girl, get 
up and get.

Widow Dunn (Parody), 
Sung by Billy Carter. 
Dedicated to Harrington and Hart. 
I 
know a 
big fat widow, 
That keeps a 
livery stable, 
A 
making beds for horses that are sick, 
She's an awful early riser, 
And a 
champion appetizer, 
Like an eight-day clock 
She goes around on tick. 
She's from the country poor-house, 
Her husband was a 
tramp, 
In the English army he did beat a 
drum, 
And for singing tar-heeled Hanna's, 
Or murdering sick pianos, 
There's no marker for the big fat Widow Diann. 
CHORUS. 
She is hunky, she is chunky, 
She's as handsome as a 
monkey, 
She's a 
fairy, she's contrary, 
She's a 
lamb, .T. mean a 
ham, 
She's as tall as any ladder, 
I'd slug her if I 
had her, 
And kick the chest protector off the Widow Dunn. 
WIDOW DUNN (PA.nony).—CONTINITED. 
She steals the morning papers 
Away from every door, 
She's an acrobactic, break-neck son of a 
gun, 
And at every wake or funeral, 
She goes to sing and dance, 
Such a 
tender creature is the widow Dunn. 
She's freckled, but she's pretty, 
And well developed feet, 
She has one back tooth that weighs a 
half a 
ton, 
And at every passing stranger 
She fires an ancient egg, 
So familiar is the Widow Dunn. 
CHORUS. 
She is moody, she is sankey, 
She's consumptive, she is crankey, 
She's rheumatic, she's lunatic, 
She's a 
bum, she weighs a 
ton, 
She is crazy, she is careless, 
She is toothless, she is hairless, 
Such a 
chrorno is the big fat Widow Dunn.

Kicking Mule. 
Copyrighted, 1879. by A. J. Frsurn, 24 Vesey St., N. Y. 
Originally sung by BILLY Canxzn. 
There was a 
little kicking man, 
His name was Simon Slick, 
He owned a 
mule with dreamy eyes, 
And how that milk could kick. 
He'd shut one eye and shake his tail, 
And greet you with a 
smile, 
Then gently telegraph his leg, 
And raise you half a 
mile. 
Crionus. 
This mule was a 
kicker, 
He'd raise you up slicker, 
And knock you down quicker 
Than Baxter street liquor, 
He eat like a 
micker, 
A 
hungry bill sticker, 
As a 
kicker, no quicker 
Could ever be found. 
His skin was gutta percha, 
And his hoof was hard as lead, 
He'd lift y: u 
like a 
feather too, 
And star d 
you on your head, 
He'd kick as quick as lightning, 
And he had an iron jaw, 
He was just the thing to have aromad 
To tame your mother-in-law. 
CHORUS. 
His hoof would amaze ye 
And make you feel hazy, 
How nice he could raise ye 
And knock you clean crazy. 
This mule was a 
daisy, 
Although he was lazy, 
This daisy so lazy 
Could kick like a 
steer. 
KICKING MULE. 
(Continued.) 
He—bit a 
Thomas cat in two, 
And pulverized a 
hog, 
He dissected seven Chinamen, 
And mash'd a 
yaller dog, 
He kicked the stuffing from a 
goose, 
And broke a 
nigger's back, 
And stopped an Erie railway train, 
And kicked it off the track. 
CHORUS. 
His shoes they were rusty, 
His temper was crusty, 
His eyes they were musty, 
His tail it was dusty, 
His shape would disgust ye, 
He'd kick till he'd bust ye, 
lie was musty and dusty, 
And rusty also. 
He'd stop a 
steamboat with his head, 
And kick it out of sight, 
He'd kick a 
boarding house apart 
At twelve o'clock at night. 
The boarders in their short stop clothes (suits), 
They stood and held their breath, 
When he rammed his hind legs down his throat 
And kicked himself to death. 
CHORUS. 
This mule he was spunky, 
He'd climb like a 
monkey 
And bray like a 
donkey, 
You bet he was bunkey, 
Although he was chunkey, 
No fool or no flunkey , 
Played him for a 
monkey, ' 
Pr donkey, oh, no. 
CARTER. 
Oh, Jove is such a 
very funny thing, 
And it catches the young and the old, 
It's just like a 
plate of boarding-house hash, 
And many a 
man it has sold. 
It makes you feel like a 
fresh water eel, 
And causes your head to swell. 
You lose your mind, for love is blind, 
And it empties your pocket-book as well. 
Csouus. 
Boys keep away from the gals, I 
say, 
Give them lots of room, 
Or you'll find when you'fe wed, 
They will bang you till you're dead, 
With bald-headed end of a 
broom. 
When man is gone on a 
pretty little gal, 
He talks just as gentle as a 
dove; 
He spends all his money, and calls her his honey, 
For to show her he is solid on his love. 
When his money is gone and his clothes in hock, 
He finds the old saying it is true, 
That a 
mole on the arm is worth two on the leg, 
But what is he going for to do. 
Boys keep away, etc. 
Such sayings I 
don't use at alit 
For fear some accident might befall; 
I 
might get pulled for knowing theca 
So I 
guess I'd better stop_ 
On the quiet twixt you and I: 
Of danger I 
am always shy. 
I'd like to stop and say good-bye 
But Cheese it, here's a 
cop. 
Sung tith great success by Miss CARRIE DUNCAN, 
Tony Pas-
tor's theatre. 
WHEN eighteen years old, and just grdWing bold 
Of me cupid made quite a 
happy young bride 
By shooting his dart through, and sending my heart to 
A gentleman stranger, whom I 
had espied 
Reclining at leisure, enjoying his pleasure 
Beneath the light rose-bush full burdened with bloom 
go kindly he pressed me, and gently addressed me 
Remarking, look here, miss, there's plenty of room. 
CHORUS. 
Under the rose-bush, under the rose-bush, 
Picking the clover and picking the way, 
Under the rose-bush, under the rose-bush, 
He asked me to kiss him, I 
did not say nay. 
Of modesty heedless, in fact it was needless, 
We sat by the side of that May-bedecked hedge, 
heard his confession of love and depression, 
He asked for a 
kiss in exchange for the pledge, 
I 
never denied it, but then and there tried it, 
Beneath that bright-rose bush f 
till burdened with bloom 
So like the May flowers, which served as a 
bower, 
It seemed quite as sweet as the lovely perfume. 
Under the rose-bush, & c. 
At sun's early dawning, I 
went there each morning 
To meet my romantic and strangely met swain, 
All mystery was banished, all secrecy vanished 
Dear Ned vowed he'd love me again and again. 
We do not like walking, we much prefer talking 
Beneath that bright rose-bush, full burdened with bloos..t, 
So when to the altar I 
went without falter 
I 
had my dear Ned for 4, happy bridegroom.

Parody on Babies on Our Block. 
Written and sung by Billy Carter with great suese.ess 
You can talk of ugly babies, 
On onr block it is a 
sight, 
To see a 
thousand babies chaw 
And claw with all their might. 
There is pug-nosed babies, goggle-eyed kids, 
And some of the good old stock, 
It's a 
regular menagerie, 
The babies on the block. 
Mrs. Grady's got a 
baby 
That talked before ' twas born, 
Another by the name of Simpson, 
With a 
nose like a 
Wm. goat's horn; 
They'll get squalling and bawling, 
And they'd gather in a 
flock, 
Barnum ought to make a 
call 
On the babies on our block.

Little Johnny Toothpick 
And Susan Turpentine, 
A

For smashing Grandpa's clock, 
They'd win the prize for swallowing flies, 
These babies on our block.

PARODY ON BABIES ON OUR BLOCK.—CONTINUED. 
There's an Italian kid just two gears old, 
With eyes in the back of his head, 
You can guess how the daddy feels 
When the young one's hair is red; 
Some have got no eyes, and some have got no nose, 
Arid a 
black and tan kid 
With an elephant hoof 
And forty-'leven toes; 
Some's dramatic, some's lunatic, 
One kid has a 
wooden ear, 
Another one, they call Napoleon, 
Drinks his barrel of lager beer. 
They'll rear and tare, 
And pull their hair, 
Until your nerves they shock, 
They'll scream and yell, 
And raise old fun, 
The babies on our block. 
CHORUS. 
Little Sally Falseteetb, 
Sitting in a 
custard pie, 
A 
crying 'cause her little brother 
Slugged her in the eye. 
Rise, Sally, rise, knock his eye out with a

An' name the day, my cushla machree ? 
Whisper, my darling, I've the purtiest cottage 
On the banks of the Shannon, close by the say; 
I 
built it meself for the loveliest crature, 
And Kathleen, ' tis built out of soft yellow clay. 
Then hear me, &c. 
Oh what would it be if you where not in it, 
To gladden the heart which beats only for thee; 
Then name the day Kathleen, and don't keep me waiting 
Kathleen my darling, my cushla machree. 
Then hear me, &c. 
Years shall pass by, an' silvered your ringlets, 
And time may bring trials an' troubles to thee ; 
But Shamus' love will lighten all sorrows, 
So name the day, Kathleen, my cushla machree. 
Then hear me, &c. 
You may drink of the dew that falls from the heavens, 
That glisten like pearly drops ' neath the sun's ray; 
While you gladden the heart of the boy who adores you, 
Then Kathleen, my darling, oh, jist name the day. 
Then hear me, & c.

Pretty little Nancy will you love me? 
For you know I

I 
will love you in the morning and the evening, 
If you will only wed me, Nancy Green. 
'Twas in among the sweet grape vine 
Where first I 
met Miss Nance, 
The little'birds sang sweetly,

She did not answer no, 
And on next Sunday afternoon 
We both to the church will go.

And her dad was Dutch,

She slipped on a

Run the crust in her eye, 
But the villain still pursued her. 
Oh, now my story's ended, 
She married a

And she died very dead 
With a

Round de meadows am a

The darkies' mournful song. 
While the mocking-bird is singing, 
Happy as the day is long. 
Where the ivy is a

There old massa is a

Sleeping in the cold, cold ground.

Down in the corn-field 
Hear that mournful sound; 
All the darkies are a 
weeping— 
Massa's in the cold, cold ground. 
When the autumn leaves were falling, 
When the days were cold, 
'Twas hard to hear old massa calling, 
Cause he was so weak and old. 
Now the orange tree is blooming 
On the sandy shore, 
Now the summer days are coming, 
Massa never calls no more. 
Down in the corn-field, &c. 
Massa made the darkies love him, 
He always was so kind, 
Now they sadly weep above him, 
Mourning, for he leave them behind.

Sung with great success by the German emperor, Girs W ILLIAMS. 
I've a 
casket at home that is filled with precious gems; 
I 
have pictures of friends dear to me, 
And I've trinkets so rare, that came many years ago. 
From my far distant home across the sea. 
But there's one sweet little treasure that I'll ever dearly prize, 
Better far than all the wealth beneath the wave ; 
Tho' a 
small faded flow'ret, that I 
placed in childhood's days. 
'Tis a 
flower from my angel mother's grave. 
CHORUS. 
Treasured in my mem'ry like a 
happy dream, 
Are the loving words she gave, 
And my heart fondly cleaves to the dry and withered leaves— 
'Tis a 
flower from my angel mother's grave. 
In the quiet country churchyard they laid her down to sleep; 
Close beside the old home she's at rest, 
And the low, sacred mound is enshrined within my heart, 
By the sweet ties of love forever blest. 
In the still and silent night I 
often dream of home again, 
And the visions ever tells me to be brave ; 
st.For the last link that binds me to the place I 
love so well, 
Is the flower from my angel mother's grave. 
Treasured in my mem'ry, &c.

Sung by Tom DIXON at the San Francisco Minstrels, and made 
Popular by JAMES O'NEIL. 
The fisherman and his child are drowned, 
Caine ringing through the town; 
The father and child lay under the tide, 
And friends did mourn around; 
The poor wife and mother prayed aloud, 
Oh, God! it cannot be, 
For in yonder mist I 
see them still, 
Their milk-white sails I 
see. 
(Repeat last 2 
lines.) 
CHORUS: 
'Twas the voice of their God that they heard 
As they sank in the deep; 
Come to me, I 
love thee, 
And thy precious soul I'll keep, 
Come to me, I 
love thee, 
Thy precious soul I'll keep. 
The fisherman saw his boat was lost, 
He tried to save his child, 
He battled the waves with all human power, 
But the wind was howling wild; 
Then he spoke to his child, 
She answered not; he raised her tiny head, 
He cried in despair; Thy will be done! 
The child he loved was dead. 
(Repeat 2 
last lines.) 
; 
And when the storms ceased, the sea went down, 
Brave men went on the shore, 
The tide had gone out, they searched all about, 
From the sea two forms they bore, 
Their faces were calm, their hands were raised, 
As if in silent prayer, 
The father in life had clasped his child, 
In death they found him there. 
(Repeat 2 
last lines.)

Dar's a 
lone grave on de oder side of de creek 
Dat knows no Decoration Day, 
For him who over yonder sleeps 
Is only a 
Nigger, dey say! 
Dey gave him his freedom, but took away his home, 
He died an old vagrant, entirely unknown, 
And left not a 
soul to be sad 
But an ole yaller dog—'twas all dat he had. 
Dey dug a 
rude hole and chucked him awa5r, 
Dis poor ole colored slave; 
Not a 
prayer for his rest did anyone say, 
And dat ole yaller dog lay down on his grave, 
And dar you can see him day after day, 
At morning, at eve and at noon; 
But dar's no inducements can drive him away 
From his place beside de grave, 
of a

Dar's a

But to me dis little mound looks bigger; 
For dar's a

The yarn as I'm about to spin, 
Is all on account of Eliza; 
I'll tell you how I 
was taken in, 
All on account of Eliza; 
She said that she'd ever be true to one, 
But she bolted away with a 
son of a 
gun! 
So I 
cut my stick and to sea I 
run, 
That it's all on account of Eliza. 
CHORUS : 
All on account, all on account, 
All on account of Eliza; 
He cut his stick and to sea he run, 
All on account of Eliza. 
I've nearly been blown away in a 
gale, 
All on account of Eliza; 
And I've almost been eaten up by a 
whale, 
All on account of Eliza; 
I've had sword cuts by dozens, and I've been she..

I've had yellow fever and also the blue; 
I've been bitten by sharks, and by crocodiles, too, 
All on account of Eliza.

My duty is now, smart lads, to press,

If they say " No!" why I

So look up, my messmates, some boys for the sea, 
And if to your summons they do not agree, 
Why, shiver my timbers, just tell 'em from me, 
That it's all on account of Eliza. 
CHORUS: 
All on account, all on account, 
All on account of Eliza; 
Why, shiver my timbers, just tell 'em says he, 
That it's all on account of Eliza. 
I've courted the ladies all through my life, 
All on account of Eliza; 
But never could steer to the proper wife, 
All on account of Eliza; 
I've kissed and I've hugged them in ev'ry port, 
The fat and the lean, the tall and the short; 
But somehow or other, they weren't my sort, 
All on account of Eliza.

NEVER AGAIN, 
Sung with great success by TONY PASTOR. 
How often we hear old fogies declare, 
If they could live over again; 
They'd never get wed or caught in a 
snare, 
But play quite a 
different game; 
It's all very well for people to talk, 
Of things in this world they would do; 
But start them again, you'd find they would walk 
The same path of life they've gone through. 
SPOKEN.—Look at the married man after his day's toil. 
He rushes home to his family and his evening meal, which 
is accompanied by the baby screaming the roof off. 
He 
says, " What an idiot a 
man must be to marry!" The 
wife says, " If I 
were to die to-morrow, you'd get married 
in a 
month," to which he replies: 
CHORUS: 
Never again, love, never again, 
Smiles are bewitching and women are vain; 
Husbands are soft that never complain, 
You've had me this time, love, but never again. 
How awful bewitching the old woman is, 
Whenever she wants a 
new dress; 
She'll ask her sweet babe to kiss his papa, 
And puts on a 
smile of the best; 
The husband, poor lamb, is dragged to a 
shop, 
To see how much money she'll waste; 
And when he is there, of course he must shop, 
Because he has got such a 
taste. 
SPOKEN.—Poor devil! the wife orders twenty yards ofl 
Ellk at three dollars a 
yard. 
The old boy goes home sing-
Never again, love, etc. 
Sweet honeymoons and connubial bliss, 
Are all very nice, I 
dare say; 
But some married couples are always amiss, 
They're fighting and rowing all day; 
The wife says, " I'm sure I'll go home to ma, 
And thus from a 
brute I'll remain; 
But when she starts out, she finds it's too far, 
And turns to her dear home again. 
SPOKEN.—And laying her head artfully on his shoulder, 
says, " James, dear, you won't tell me to boil my face in 
the fish-kettle 
again, will you, darling?"

You call me sweet and tender names, 
And softly smooth my tresses, 
And all the while my happy heart 
Beats time to your caresses. 
You love me in your tender way, 
I 
answer as you let me; 
But ah! there comes another day. 
The day when you'll forget me, 
The day when you'll forget me. 
I 
know that ev'ry fleeting hour 
Is marked by thoughts I 
bring you, 
I 
know there dwells a 
subtle pow'r 
In the sweet songs I 
sing you. 
I 
do not fear the darkest way, 
With those dear arms about me, 
Ah! no, I 
only dread the day 
When you can live without me, 
When you can live without me. 
And still you call me tender names, 
And softly smooth my tresses ; 
And still my happy answ'ring heart 
Beats time to your caresses. 
Hush! let me put that touch away, 
And clasp your hands above me; 
So while I 
ask to die that day, 
The day you will not love me, 
The day you will not love me. 
You need not check the thoughts that rime 
With darkness wrapt about them, 
For gazing in your earnest eyes, 
My heart can almost doubt them. 
Yet hush my whispers as you may, 
Such chidings do not fret me; 
1,1 
no, I 
only fear that day, 
The day when you'll forget me, 
The day when you'll forget we.

I've wandered very far away 
From the clime where I

Dejected and forlorn; 
No master kind to treat me well, 
To cheer me when in pain, 
I 
want to see the cotton fields, 
And the dear old home again. 
CHORUS. 
Oh the good old days are passed and gone, 
I 
sigh for them in vain; 
I 
want to see the cotton fields, 
And the dear old home again. 
I'm left all sad and lonely now, 
When my days are very few, 
My wife and children both are gone, 
I 
don't know what to do; 
My master too, he may be dead, 
His hair was turning gray, 
Oh, let me see that good old home, 
Before I 
pass away. 
Oh, the good old days, eta. 
When I 
was free I 
left that land, 
Where the days are bright and fair, 
Where missus spoke to me so kind, 
When I 
was bowed with care; 
I 
left that home no friends to find, 
My heart was filled with pain, 
Oh, take me to that good old home, 
To see it once again. 
ON the good old days,

:o: 
Though silence and coldness have us parted forever, 
I 
have come to tell, with deep pain in my heart, 
For the sake of the past and the love you once bore me, 
Oh ' twere but right that we in friendship should part. 
Even now, while the wound you inflicted is aching, 
A 
voice in my heart pleads in soft tones for you; 
Who wavered and faltered, were fickle and altered, 
Oh, why were you false, when you could have been true? 
Cuonus, 
Why were you false, why so unkind, 
How could you forget one who lived but for you? 
The vows that were spoken, by you have been broken, 
Farewell forever, why were you untrue? 
Long years may elapse, and my name be forgotten, 
Although you once feared was my love for you true, 
But my love you accepted, first craved, then neglected, 
Whate'er unto others, I 
was faithful to you. 
New pleasures may greet you, new faces may meet you, 
New loves for a 
time your heart may entwine; 
Their friendship though newer, can never be truer, 
Or ever as tender or faithful as mine. (Chorus).

IT PLEASES BOTH OLD AND YOUNG, 
it is a Pac simile of a Trick practiced by ait 
the Professors of Magic. 
It is arranged so systematically, and is accom-
panied with directions so plainly written, that, with 
a 
single perusal, any person may become an adept 
in an unfailing source of amusement. 
Read what a 
leading Journal says of it: 
" 
An ingenious little book of the thaumaturgic order 
has been sent us, called HumPrs DIIMPTY,' and bound 
in such a 
way as to give opportunity for a 
decidedly 
puzzling trick. 
While presenting the ordinary appear-
ance of a 
child's picture-book, gayly printed and colored, 
it is so bound that a 
practiced manipulator, taking it 
up, and flirting the leaves rapidly over, can make it ap • 
pear to be filled with copies of only one picture, or with 
blank pages, or with any one of quite a 
succession of 
figures. 
One minute the pamphlet, quickly thumbed, 
appears to contain nothing but portraits of Harlequin, 
in his tesselated suit; the next, only Columbine; then, 
nothing but Pantaloon, or Riding Hood, or Mephisto-
pheles. 
A. little practice, and the directions printed 
with the book will make any-body at home in the hand- , 
ling of it."—Phila. Evening Bulletin.
