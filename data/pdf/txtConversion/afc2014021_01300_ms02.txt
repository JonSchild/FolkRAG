INTERVIEW LOG
00:00:00 Interviewee is signing documents, other housekeeping; talking to Don about how 
apartment is cold, has an earache, trying to get out of rent contract; complaining about being 
cold, why wearing hat, ear hurts.
00:05:24 Lives in Portland all of his life, great=grandfather was the governor of Oregon.
00:00:6:00 Been doing this work since 1989, and has always worked with developmentally 
disabled and schizophrenics.  Tends to work with folks that other people don’t want to work 
with.  Currently he goes to people’s homes.
00:00:7:00 He likes to work with people that other people are uncomfortable with: example of 
guy he worked with that thought he was Jesus Christ, had a great time together.  They need 
someone to listen.  He loves to go out hiking with them.
 
00:07:40 He has found that in cases of mental illness, people are afraid of them so don’t want to 
be around them.  They are isolated and "they stew in their psychosis".
  
00:08:17 He started out working with MRDD sex offenders in group setting, many victimized as 
kids...some of the best people I have ever worked with; since then, I work with people other 
people are afraid of.
00:09:00 One guy walked out into traffic to prove he was Jesus, another led police on a 
high-speed chase.  Other people try and tell the guy he isn’t Jesus.  I listen to them; they need to 
talk about it without being corrected. I say: “I don’t think your father, God, would mind if we go 
for a hike”.
00:10:52 Parent don’t know what to do with them, but I get them out there and having fun.  They
improve.
00:12:10 Other jobs: Pizza maker, had a pervy boss who hit on women.

00:13:00 Difference between caregiving and other jobs: You can touch lives, not just punch a 
clock.
  
00:13:54 Could tell you about dark side of industry.  There are patterns in caregiving world, in 
detox and group homes.  There are people who care and there are people who are predators. Seen
a lot of situations with predators.  Also, good people who are burnt out.
  
00:15:30 Helps if you yourself have gone through things; too, then you have empathy.  Two 
paths - become a predator or you become a person with empathy and can use it to help others.
00:16:32 As a professional, you don’t tell them about your past bad experiences, but they can see
you are "real".  That is what makes a good caregiver.
00:17:22 Advice: If you go into mental health system, make sure the person has malpractice 
insurance and a license.  As an independent contractor for state of Oregon and under SEIU 
contract, have to have this.  Some folks are not qualified, and really the state can’t do much if 
something goes wrong.
00:19:00 Have to ask caregiver probing questions, looking to see if have their own issues and not
healed.
Can only take you as far as they have gone in own healing.
00:19:45 How did you get trained?  I have empathy, I went to college for this, life-long journey.
  
00:20:30 Have friends I can compare notes with.
00:21:30  Discusses what good caregivers and psychologists do.
00:22:24  Typical day?  Parents deserve medals because they haven’t given up, but tired.
  
00:23:27 I have a sense of humor, so parents who are about to have nervous breakdown, I come 
in and get them laughing.  Get calls from crying moms, shake it off, and go to work.
00:24:24 How can you not get emotionally involved??? Set boundaries.  Good people get burnt 
out because it is hard to set boundaries.
00:25:06 Story about addicted, HIV positive MRDD guy who had a child with his girlfriend and 
it was his job to help him take care of the child.  Reported all of the problems to the state, took 
the baby away, everyone mad at him.  Baby had a number of broken bones.  Felt terrible, like he 
2
didn’t get there fast enough.  Baby died in protective custody.  Took a leave of absence for a 
while after that. Don’t take on all cases now.
00:29:25 Example of client with head injury, biggest pervert in the world.  But great sense of 
humor.
00:30:22 Behind the scenes terminology.  Everyone has a sense of humor.  I don’t see as many 
people as I did in group home setting.
00:31:14 Difference between group home and independent contractor - Like it that middle men 
are cut out, I like being independent contractor.  Worked for companies and I saw a lot of 
corruption.  Nepotism.  Family members running amok.  One client died from neglect.  I turned 
them in.   Program director embezzling.
00:33:12 Fired for union organizing.  Why there is independent contractors now, lots of group 
home corruption, after suing, a family won lawsuit. 
00:34:00 Now I have enough money to pay my bills, after making $9 an hour for years.
00:35:00 Different than group homes – I work directly with client and family; they can fire me if 
they don’t like me.  I answer to them.  
00:36:32 Have enough to put away for retirement now.
  
00:37:11 Miss some former co-workers, some are friends now.  One manager “had his back”.
00:38:29 Someone from the outside listening to him talk about clients would get freaked out.
  
00:39:45 Hard to explain culture but it is there.  Learn quirks.  Lot of clients, and men in general,
are awkward with women.  We all have sex drive, imagine how it is to think you are Jesus and 
have a sex drive.  These guys want a sex life, so funny things can happen.  I’m like the big 
brother.  Learn to laugh at it.
 
00:41:57 Nicknames for some of these types of mistakes.  We laugh a lot but not laughing at 
them.  Stories like telling girl at bank she has great tits, or trying to pay an escort with pork 
chops. I try to direct them to other ways to meet women.
00:43:31 I don’t work with women – not with the types of people I work with.  In these cases, I 
think it is best for men to work with men, women with women.  People who have sex disorders, 
this is best.
3
00:44:00 Most gratifying? - is when I realize I am doing something: hear from parents that son 
was depressed but now better.
00:44:43 What is the worst? - Story about client who swallowed batteries.
00:49:07 Union difference – Night and Day.  Ronald Reagan broke the unions.  Unions not 
perfect, but listen to what I just said about corruption.  Google my name, I was fired for union 
activity.  All of what I did, for $9.  I am fucked without a union.  I hate the Koch brothers.  Look 
on the internet, trying to bust unions.  Scott Walker busting unions.
00:52:41 Without unions won’t get people who care, get predators, huge turnover.  I have been 
with my clients for 5 years, clients need this stability.  That is what a union is good for.  They are 
what you make of them.
  
00:54:05 Now can go to doctor, help with legal situations.
00:55:16 CHANGE TO A NEW VIDEOTAPE.
 
00:55:46 Put my video on YouTube so everyone can see it.
00:56:00 He is the pressure valve for clients and their parents, so can’t always do the union 
events.  He has to be available.
00:57:29  State was going to cut wage, not Governor Kitzhaber’s idea.  But union was in his face
– so decided not to slash my wage by $10 an hour.  I pay my own malpractice, taxes.  $24 an 
hour before taxes, malpractice.  It boils down $15 an hour.  It is less expensive to pay caregiver 
than if one of the client’s snaps and they are put in mental institution or police deal with them.  I 
also pay health care.  It is worth investing in me.
 
01:00:44 Caregiving largest industry, lot of mental health issues in US. Supreme Court decision 
that we cannot be a group, form a union, is terrible.
  
01:01:41 Jon Stewart Show story, talking about Koch brothers.
1:02:28  Hobbies – Didn’t ever have money to travel, but I embrace my "Oregon-ness" and I 
hike in gorge, nature resets me.  Yoga too, film junkie.
  
01:03:30 High blood pressure, so changed diet and started exercising.
4
01:05:05 – How does community see you?  Parents of the clients think of us as angels.  Client 
with severe brain injury story, taught himself to talk and walk, overcame anger issues.  Great but 
doesn’t have good filters.
  
1:07:16 Part of my job is damage control. For example, inappropriate sexual behavior. To his 
Mom, I am a saint.
  
01:08:33 – Others think I just sit around and watch TV.
01:09:50 Some people appreciate the work we do, others think we have a cushy job, but don’t 
understand the stress, but the stress of the system is there also.  Right trying to get rid of SS and 
Medicaid.
CHANGE BATTERY
01:10:50 Glad that you are receptive to what I am saying.
01:11:52  Parents appreciate us.  Don’t know who to call, they call me.   I help them and it takes 
pressure off.
01:12:39 Others who think it is a cush job, and republicans who want to bust unions.
01:13:37  Our clients are up against a system, have to navigate ss [Social Security], Medicaid, 
medicare.  Elements out there that want to get rid of this; this is horseshit. Those programs keep 
the clients alive.  Not perfect, but all we have. Navigating them is hard, part of my stress is 
helping them do this. Navigating the state agencies is difficult and exhausting.
01:16:10 Money in industry now because of ACA [Affordable Care Act], first time in 30 years 
seeing this.  Mentally ill people on streets.  Our president has created ACA, and my clients have 
some money and it is nice.  Not a lot, but more.  Things might get better in state agencies.
  
01:17:44 Best investment for society, is investing in care for mentally ill.  Invest in getting them 
into a good apartment, good caregiver, consistency, they are comfortable and do alright.
01:18:59 How does the community benefit – not on streets causing problems. Families have less 
stress.  Count on the fact they can call Steve.  Better at their jobs, no stress related illness, 
nervous breakdown.  Clients sometimes get jobs, so it is a production thing, a moral thing.
01:21:51 After 30 years, not much of a retirement, don’t have a lot to show (crying). If someone 
watching, this can create a better situation for mentally ill and people like me in the future.
5
01:23:24 More about politics: Koch brothers and union busting.  I care about my country, want to
see it get back to fair and balanced.
01:24:30 Talking about corrupt program where he used to work, and hopes that someone in 
power will hear this tape and do something.  Nice to feel appreciated.
