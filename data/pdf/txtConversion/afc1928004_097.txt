• 
Tule popular young Irish comedian, vocalist and dancer, was born' 
in Boston. Mass., February 1, 1848, whither his parents had emigrated 
from Ireland, a 
short time previous ort account of political troubles. 
At a 
very early age, he evinced so decided a 
talent for the stage that 
many managers urged upon his parents the propriety of his adopting 
it as a 
profession; but with the exception of appearing with a 
band 
of Juvenile Minstrels, at Springfield, Mass., July 3, 1859, he made no 
public appearance, until the winter of 1886, when he adopted the pro-
fession of which he has since become so distinguished a 
light. 
lie 
has appeared in most of the principal cities of the United States and 
Canadok, in connection with the best Minstrel troupes of the country; 
and everywhere the name of JERRY COHAN has become a " household 
word." He joined Mac Evoy's " Ilibernicon" as an Irish Comedian in 
August, 1169, playing " Barney, the Irish Guide," achieving the great-
est stleCe$13, and being everyw here pronounced by the Press and Public 
far superior to any one who had ever attempted the part. 
Ile nest 
engaged with McGill's " Mirror of Ireland,' Sept. 1870, and as " Dan 
Donahoe," 
gained new laurels, his appearance on the stage being re-
ceived with the most enthusiastic applause, as unbounded as it is well 
erited. M R. COHAN is one of the few comedians who elevate the 
I 
Ash character, avoiding those coarse insinuations and allusions so 
common to most Irish comedians, and be never fails to win the hearts 
of his hearers, especially the Irish portion thereof. 
One especially distinctive feature of Mn. CollaN is the fact that he 
is author as well as actor, having himself written some of his mos: 
popular specialties; many of which have been filched from him by 
other and Inferior performers. 
His professional career has thus far 
been a 
success ; young, ambitious, versatile, and deserving, be may 
yet reach the topmost round of the ladder of professional fame.

I'm always ready for a

So try the value of my words by jumping on my car. 
LFor Daniel always is on hand that place beyond just on the stand. 
To hovel, hut or palace grand, I'll drive you near or far. 
To place, or park, to Murtv Moore's or Noah's ark. 
In light or dark, 111 drive you near or far.

Then if you want to take a 
ride 
I'll quickly have my horse 'long side, 
To Phenix Park or Liffy's tide, I'll drive you on my car. 
Then whiP, crack, off we go. 
Never slow, as you know, 
A 
shilling's all I

jump upon my car. 
If your honor is a 
stranger here and want to know the town, 
I 
will describe all as we ride, the streets, sir, up and down. 
First thing we'll cross the Carlisle bridge, up famous Sackvh.e 
street, 
As far as Nelson's m'onument,'Sn'handsome and complete. 
To Dublin castle next we'll go, the LOrd Leftenant's house I'll 
show, 
Four Courts, and Patrick's church, also, so jump upon my car. 
If you're in for.fun, to Nancy Hand's we'll take a 
run. 
Good lunch and .punch, and purty girls are there. 
Then if, & c. 
The Prince of Wales to Dublin he once came-to see the town, 
Each Jarvey was afraid but me to drive his highness 'round, 
When he sat on the sate, sez I 
just keep your honk astore, 
And the divil such a,ride he said, he ever had before. 
Now every word I 
tell te you is very true, if doubt you do, 
just ax the Prince himself, yes, do, then jump upon my car. 
Then off we,bo.ult, don't mind the goults,

As if you'd been ill-trated. 
There, go your ways, yourself to plaza. 
You only need be tbroublize,

From here away to Dublin. 
There's Pat Malone at least you'll own, 
And Mike, and Clanty Brady, 
And Barney Bourke, and Terry O'Rotule. 
I'm not in earnest, Thady. 
Now, Thady dear, on

And listen awhile to razin,

She cooked arid none the chamber -work in a

And there I 
called to see her every evening; 
I 
told sweet tales of love, which I 
thought she swallowed down, 
And ten o'clock would be my hour for leaving. 
And then I'd tarry at the gate with her for half an hour, 
Tho' sometimes we would walk up street to get a 
whiskey sour; 
I'd breathe her name on gin cocktails, in sonic saloon.or bower, 
Till love and liquor made me most distracted. 
One night I 
called, she was in tears, I 
asked her what it meant— 
In accents wild she implored me to leave her; 
I 
said no, that I'd stand by her till my last cent was spent, 
I 
loved her so I 
never conld deceive her. 
She pushed me to the door,- I

did demand, 
When a 
hoosier six 'foot high rushed in—I

For he panelled my poor head till I

rushed out to the gate, was half-blinded, bruised, and raw; 
On vengeance bent straight back I

He spoke: for four long years, he said, he'd braved the storing -~1

And he'd murder any rascal that came near his lawful bride.

THE.,.INIIITTON PIE MAN. 
Written and sung by JERRY Gt")E.L"..*. 
You see l'm a 
broken down swell, 
My misfortunes to you I 
will tell; 
My 
present vocation as a 
situatioxi, 
It does'nt suit me very well. 
Your money I 
once would despise-
I'd enough of my own and likew;so 
rd a 
gay coach and pair, a 
handsome fast mare, 
But now I 
must sell mutton pies, 
,Spo,cen—Y 
es, gentlemen. I 
was once rich and happy; twas a 
woman that made me what I am. 
She was the cause of my 
downfall, and it's for the sake of her dear meidry that I am 
selling— 
Cuouus.—Mutton pies, mutton pies, 
Hot, hot, smoking hot, such mutton I've got, 
Olt, who buys mutton pies, just a penny for hot 
mutton pies. 
She sold mutton pies when she'd meet 
Any hungry ones out on the street; 
I 
gave her a 
guinea and never took any, 
The very first time we did meet. 
I 
found out her number, and name, 
And next day- to see her I 
came; 
I 
loved her sincerely, truly and dearly, 
To me she appeared the same. 
Spoken— Yes, we were to be married, and .1 
turned all my 
property into money, an,/ 
j,iaced my bank account into her 
fair hand, for sho .atcl she'd like to travel. 
And she did 
travel, b•_:!, without me, for she took my bank account with her 
mid loft nothing behind but me, with a broken heart and the 
where she sold 
Mutter. pies, ite. 
I 
found the whole thing was a 
plot; 
For as soon as my money she'd got, 
She eloped with a 
baker, his wife he did make her, 
I 
tried them to find but could not. 
So I 
bought out her stand on'the Square, 
And evenings I 
watch for her there, 
I 
dream of her sleeping and waking, 
I'm weeping in mem'ry of one false and fair. 
Spoken—The other night I 
dreamed that the baker she'd wed 
had cut her throat with his bread knife arid robbed her of 
my money. 
And I thought her ghost appeared to me. I 
trie I 
to get away from the horrid spectre. 
And in thc midst 
of my agony I 
awoke. Was it a 
dream ? No! for out upon the 
zilent stillness of the night I 
heard the ghostly voice singing,

THE MAD BUTCHER.—[CoNctunt:n.] 
Mary Jane, you don't know her, but, ha I 
The thoughts of her now makes me start, 
She shone on my path like a 
star, 
But she stolen my pluck and my heart; 
Each day she called into the shop, 
When my heart 'gainst my ribs would go thump; 
When she ask'd me to weigh her a 
chop, 
And some suet, a 
jolly good lump. 
Spoken.— I'd cut her a 
hundred weight of suet and place it by 
her chops, and think how well we should suit each other, but no, 
she refused me because— 
I'm the mad butcher, &c. 
She smiled on me one afternoon, 
I 
grew hot and cold by degrees; 
I 
told her my love very soon, 
In the sawdust I 
knelt on my knees; 
But she spurn'd me and then what was more, 
I 
know you will say it was too bad, 
She married the tailor next door, 
And ever since then I've been mad. 
Spoken,—Mad I 
stark, staring mad I She married the ninth 
part of a man a tailor I 
in preference to me, hut I 
had re-
venge—he took her abroad to Highbury, and there she got pos-
session of all his hard-
earn'd savings, and she lavished it away 
upon dress, she bought a 
chignon and she practiced the Grecian 
Bend, and then she paid a 
lot of little boys to say— 
He's the mad butcher, <Lc. 
One day I'd a 
furious shock, 
I 
hack'd and chopped up the meat; 
At one blow I 
sever'd the block, 
And I 
pitched the sheep's heads in the street; 
By turns I 
now laugh and then cry, 
But somehow I've lost all my trade: 
I 
cry, buy, buy, the, buy, buy, buy, buy, 
But my customers all seem afraid. 
Spoken.— Yes, and I'm as quiet as a 
lamb, I 
wouldn't hurt a 
worm, but they come round tlfe shop and pick up the block orna-
ments, then look up to know the price; directly they see me they 
remain silent, not a 
word, but I 
can read their thoughts, that— 
I'm the mad butcher,. &c.

ROWING ON THE LAKE. 
Song and Dance, written by JERItY COIIAN, for BILLY Leucnorr. 
Out on the Lake, one summer's night, 
To row I 
took my love; 
The peeping, twinkling stars shone bright 
From cloudless skies above. 
While floating onward with the tide, 
Her hand I 
dared to take; 
I 
asked her then to be my bride, 
While rowing on the lake. 
Such darling names I 
called her, • 
tad loving tales I 
told her, - 
To my heart I 
did enfold her, 
While rowing on the lake; 
To my heart I 
did enfold her, 
While rowing on the lake. 
The silver moon was shining o'er, 
Beneath its rays we'd float ; 
As near the smooth and tawny shore 
So gently moved our boat. 
The rippling waters' fairy sound 
The silence seemed to break; 
Our kindred spirits sank profound, 
While rowing on the lake. 
Such darling, V. 
And when our little boat I 
mooed, 
And led her to the shore; 
Then of my love she was assured, 
I 
kissed her o'er and o'er. 
She promised then to be my wife, 
A loving bride she'll mane; 
forget whilo E 
have life, 
Our rowing on the lake. 
Such darling, V.

THE GA.I.7i3iAT TOOK 
EYE. 
So nt and Dance, written by JERRY COHAN, for BILLY Asncaorr. 
As I 
was walking down the street the other afternoon, 
Pulled on my kids, lit my sheroot, in front of a 
saloon, 
When a 
vision floated past my sight which caused the dust to 
fly, ' 
'Twas the prettest girl I 
ever saw, the gal that took my eye. 
CIIORUS. 
She was so fair, I 
do declare [Dance. 
I 
feel so queer, when I 
am near, 
The gal that took my' eye. 
I 
watched her as she crossed the street, my heart was all aflame; 
I 
quickly waved my handkerchief, of course she done the same. 
In a 
moment I 
was at her side: " Your pardon, Miss, said. Lu 
If I 
am bold, pray tell me so, but then you took my eye." 
Chorus and Danes. 
I 
asked her if she would be mine, when we stood at her door; 
She said she'd no objection, but her parents they were poor. 
Tint I 
dont mind such trifles for to win her I 
shall try, 
And if I 
do I'll show to you the gal what took my eye. 
She was so fair, Aro. 
MORE VERSE. 
Her father is an artist, that is, in the white wash line. 
Her mother keeps an oyster stand, her fruit is very fine; 
The gal is in a 
restaurant, nice doughnuts she does fry; 
And every night when we walk out them doughnuts tfske my 
eye. 
She was so fait,

LOVELY VIOLET, 
Double song and dance. Written by JERRY COHAN for HOGAN and 
Hum'Es. 
Enter First Swell. 
Oh where can she have gone, she said she'd meet me here, 
At half past one, the time has flown and yet she don't appear. 
I'll surely be distracted if she don't come—ah well, 
I'll think myself rejected for some other colored swell. 
CHORUS 
Why do I 
love her so, (dance) 
I'm sure I 
do not know, 
Perhaps because she's beautiful—her face I'll ne'er forget, 
That winning smile and dashing style of lovely Violet. 
Enter Second Swell. 
I.wonder why it is my love she does not come, 
She said she'd meet me on this street about the hour of one, 
And now it is long after and she has not come yet, 
So up the street I'll stroll and meet my lovely Violet. 
CHORUS and DANCE. 
Enter First Swell. 
I 
wonder who's that fellow 
That looks so much like me, 
erhaps he loves my Violet—if 80 that shall not be.

That chap my style has copied, 
My girl he's trying to get.

Why are you here to meet my dear, my lovely Violet.

THE IRISHMAN AND THE JEW. 
By JERRY COHAN. 
Of a 
hod carrier once I 
heard a 
story, 
lie was climbing a 
ladder in the height of glory, 
But just as Paddy had got to the top 
A German Jew pedler near the ladder did stop, 
When some bricks dropped out of the Irishman's hod, 
And struck Mr. Jew right straight on the nob. 
The pedler had on a 
new silk hats and of course he was mad as 
the devil at Pat, 
lie looted at the Irishman and he said: " What for you try to 
break mine head V 
Pat looked down from his perch and he said: " I 
wish to the Lord 
I'd broke your head, 
Or smashed. the big nose on your face, you son of a 
lying thiev-
ing race, 
You dirty, wandering thief of a 
Jew, 
But for your forefathers, the likes of you, 
The blessed Savior so they tell 
Would be alive this day and doing well.' 
POOR OLD MIKE. 
I 
was rea -cd in Doncaster, 
Some finty years ago ; 
But times are very different 
As many of you know. 
I've had my share of sunshine, 
Of course I 
can't complain, 
But the good old days have passed away, 
And they'll never come again. 
Poor old Mike. 
CHORUS. 
But now I'm growing old, 
And my age it does decay; 
A poor old worn out stableman, 
Every one does say. 
Poor o1d Mike! poor old Mike! 
When I 
was rising six years old, 
They first put me across, 
One ot Lord Derby's favorites, 
For a 
trial round the course. 
So firm and neat I. kept my seat, 
The knowing ones they stared. 
As I 
rattled in from a 
two mile spin, 
Every one declared— 
"Fwas clever little Mike. 
But now, &c. 
Then I 
was made a 
jockey, 
It suited well my taste; 
A handy chap at a 
handicap, 
Smart at a 
steeple chase. 
East, west, north or south, 
I 
clald show an open face; 
For I 
always acted on the square, 
And never sold a 
race. 
Honest little Mike! 
But now, &AL 
But soon I 
grew too big, 
I 
could neither ' train' or waste;' 
My patrons, too, they died, 
So I 
was sacked in haste, 
But posting days were in their prime, 
A post-hack 1 
bestrode ; 
With a 
smack, ' Ya hip!' crack goes the whip, 
Rattling down the road. 
Poor old Mike ! 
But now, & c. 
But steam soon run us off tho road, 
And rhert mat iz set in; 
'Twas then I 
first knew poverty, 
And my troubles did begin. 
Relations, friends, acquaintances, 
All dead, or far away : 
I 
was odd man in a 
stable-yard 
At ba:f-a-crown a 
day. 
Poor old Mike! 
But now, &O. 
By the yootez. un's beaten out-and-on I, 
And buinUell from the yard.

Pat O'Brien it is my name; I'll tell you, boys, from whence I

No country is so dear to me as the little Isle stands near the 
sea, 
Where all the boys are blithe and free, deny it if you can. 
Ould Ireland is the place where they're famed for fun and 
Mirth, 
It's Neal can't be found if you search all o'er the earth; 
Good natured boys and girls are there, with none of them you 
can compare. 
Where every heart is free from care, that makes an Irish boy.

Pat O'Brien is my name, I'll tell you boys, from where I

Ould Ireland is the place I

Dan O'Connell, ould Ireland's friend, he struggled hard for to , 
defend, 
Gainst all invaders who did' intend to claim poor Paddy's land. 
He advocated Ireland's right with all his main and all his 
might, 
And he was poorly recompensed for all his toil and pains, 
In high courts of justice he caused them all to stare, 
With his knowledge, wit, and humor, to hear him it was rare; 
He always proved poor Paddy's friend when to his trial be did 
attend, 
lie caused the noblest back to bend to the honest Irishman. 
Pat O'Brien, etc. 
In eighteen forty-four gone by, our countrymen they had to fly, 
For famine stared in every eye along ould Ireland's shore; 
They to America did sail, leaving their wives and babies to 
vail ; 
They were determined not to fail, but their hardships endure. 
The harp that once through Tara's Halls, shall strike each chord 
again, 
To welcome back those called from across the raging main, 
May peace and plenty ever be to our little Isle that stands near

And all our toasts be, Ireland free ! and you'll be happy then.

KATY McFERRAN. 
The modest May morn looked down upon Erin, 
The land of song and the " gem of the sea," 
As I 
sat on the stile with sweet Katy MeFerran, 
Who wept like a 
child while she listened to me. 
She looked in my face with her eves full of sorrow, 
I 
knew by her glance that her heart was in pain; 
" 
Katy, darling," said I, " I 
must leave you to-morrow; 
Perhaps we may neer see each other again."

And how like an angel did Witty resemble 
•Some beautiful creature just come frorti the skies; 
ml her soft little hand in my own lay and trembled, 
As she pleaded, " don't leave me," with tears in her eyes. 
" 
Come, speak to me, darling, and tell me you love me ;" 
She raised her blue eyes, with a 
tear in each one, 
And sighed, " While you live, and the heavens above me, 
VII love you and bless you wherever you've gone." 
I 
kissed her at parting and left her in sorrow, 
And came to this country, the latx1 of the free; 
But l'm going back home to old Erin to- morrow, 
I 
know that my Katy's still waiting for me. 
And how like an angel, cte. 
I'll go to a 
neat little cottage in Erin, 
I've longed, since I 
left it, so often to se : 
And I'll rap on the door for sweet Katy McFerran,

Where cruel oppression can ne'cr overtake her, 
And the flag of •` God's country " is ever unfurled,

THE ROMAN FALL. [Corictunzn.] 
Although I 
am a 
modest man, 
I 
think it's right to say, 
Pm always first in fashion's view, 
In fact, I 
lead the way; 
Whether it's walking up Broadway, 
Or riding in the Park, 
The Roman Fall's a 
thing 0. K. 
For me a 
jolly lark. 
Cnoaus.—The Roman Fall, <Sze. 
Now Venus gives the Grecian Bend, 
Apollo gives the bow, 
The joint idea when seen West-End. 
Is really comme ii foist; 
A 
Roland good for an Oliver, 
So given in our walk, 
We swells find it more jolly far 
To do and not to talk. 
CHORIJS.—The Roman Fall, tte.. 
No more the Piccadilly crawl 
Displays the tailor's art; 
We substitute the Roman Fall, 
And charm our darling's heart; 
As three abreast we do the Row, 
The thing is quite unique, 
The patent of a 
perfect beau, 
The trademark of your clique. 
CHORUS. 
The Roman Fall, the Roman Fall, 
That graceful arch, the Roman Fall, 
The wonder of. the age I 
call, 
The swell's own walk, the Roman Fall.

in all Ireland, by the blessing of St. Patrick ; d'ye see the way• 
he sups it?" at the same time she was whisking it down her own 
dirty throat. " Musha! where's the whisky ?" says me father. 
" 
Sure I 
gave it to the baby," said Biddy. " Oh ,1 that's a 
big 
lie," says I, " father, for divil a 
drop have I 
tasted." 
While the nurse she was singing and squllling, 
Oh I 
I 
was crying and bawling, 
My father for whiskey was calling, 
At the birth of poor Terrence O'Rourke. 
At thirteen years ould I 
was sent to a 
school, 
To Father Delancy's at Bally Pantie, 
Who says, " Teddy, me boy, if my advice you will follow. 
I'll make you a 
regular out and out scholar? 
SPOKEN—" So he did; for a 
classical academy was that of 
Mr. O'Toole's; and here's a 
specimen of one of his best schol-
ars; he did'ut lam n 
us all about Jew Peter, Brien Bourn, O'Neil, 
Father Matthew, and all the rest of the gods and the goddesses. 
One morning he called we over to him, says he, " come over 
till I 
give you some advice before you go to .Amerika—in the 
first place, never give anything away that you hav'nt got. 
Secondly, never steal anything you can't carry. 
Thirdly, never 
forget poor ould Ireland, for if you do, you little trollop, you 
never can say I 
was your teacher." 
With that learning I 
had got quite sufficient, 
With the shelalah I 
too was proficient, - 
And nothing but cash was deficient, 
To be called Mr. Terrence O'Rourke.

TERRENCE O'ROURKE . (CONCLUDED.) 
Now I 
began to grow up to manhood's estate, 
I 
thought it high time to look after a 
mate; 
So I 
fixed upon Nora, from Ballyporceen, 
The swatest young erature that ever was seen. 
SPOILEN.—" Be Got 1 
you may well say that—and the head 
of her, it was stuck on the middle of her purty little shoulders 
that would put you in mind of a 
bushel of praties tied up in a 
very ugly manner; and then she had two eyes stuck in her dar-
ling little forhead, that would put you in mind of two rotten 
coelles stuck in the burnt holes of a 
blanket 1 
and the nose of 
the cratur, it would put you in mind of a 
mountain of misery 
looking down a 
hungry man's throat—and the mouth ! oh the 
mouth 
the mouth ! % would put you in mind of the big canal 
for transporting praties wholesale, be Got! 
And there was a 
beautiful assembly came to our wedding, shure there was all I 
didn't know, and a grate many more too—there was the 
O'Rourkes, the O'Tooles, the Kallagans, the Brallagans, the 
Nolans, the Dolans, the Mullocks, and the Muck Mue-Mullocks, 
and no sooner were we seated down to a beautiful dinner of 
pig's tripe and priaties, than up jumps Teddy Moore, ( trailing 
his dirty ould coat,) says he, " Who dare tread on the coat of 
an O'Moore," " Musha I 
who dare talk of an UMoore in the 
presence of a 
Muck Mulloch, who's name was known before the 
birth of Moses, and descended in regular succession down from 
'Rine. Shane to Muck, for double Muc-Muc, Muck Mulloch." 
"0171 that only shows the superiority of my family,' says 
" 
for mine's directed in a 
straight line from Noah's 
Ark." " To blazes wid Noah's Ark, mine would% dirty them-
selves going into Noah's Ark, be jabbers I 
they had a 
boat of 
their own." 
Witt that the row' begun; stieks and stones, and 
marrow-bones, up went one and down came half a 
dozen, 'till 
they all was kilt on the nitre; and just as we going, to wake 
them, they jumped up again and began to slug— 
While the whiskey in taycups wint round, 
And many lay kilt on the ground; 
And verY few weddings 'were found - 
To equal that of poor *Terrence O'Rourke.

He's been gone just six years and a 
day; 
Front ivy this letter he sent, 
And sure that's a 
nation long way I

That he stamped wid a 
kick of his fist. 
What a 
mighty fine thing, tte. 
Spoken.—Now mind, here's the letter. and I'll begin wid the

Oh, it's a 
fine thing to have good health Wien you are ill. 
Your aunt is in good spirits, though she died last night, and 
hopes it will not be long before she has the pleasure of seeing 
you. We are all well in the garrison. 
But Tim Foolzle has de-
serted all alone by himself wid two or three others, and is not

They are all t3 be tried last night, but their sentence

shall never stop till I've finished. 
My own

My self I

started for the Mat-inee I 
thought to cut a 
dash. 
The house was fill'd with beaux and belles as happy as could 
And to my coat my heart I 
lost while at the Mat-inee, 
My love had curls and teeth like pearls and wore it saucy hat. 
And when she peeped from under it lily heart it went pit pat, 
Among the crowd of beauties there no other could I

That Would compare with her I

Along with other pretty boy" just as the play was o'er, 
I 
took a 
good posish to stare closely by the exit door. 
And as my charmer came along I 
made so boliand free, 
To offer her my company home front the Matinee, 
She took my arm and with an smile, as bright as morning dew. 
She says' my name is Angeline. now pray sir who are you? 
I 
said my name was Clarence Charles that she was to me, 
By iar the dearest girl I 
saw while at the Matinee 
My love had curls, tte. 
We strati around an hour or more as happy as two birds, 
in telling her my fervent love, there was no lack of words, 
I 
asked if she was free to wed mid if she would be mine, 
She answer with cunning leer, " ill tell some other time, 
Of course we had to have ice cream fruit cake and lemonade, 
Five dollars I 
was minus by the time the bill was paid. 
Oh I 
then I 
saw her safely home and there she promised me, 
Without a 
doubt next Wednesday she'd be at. the Matinee

We kept up our flirtation often meeting after that, 
Until one day I 
saw her home, oh I

Now all young men of good advice, just take a 
word or two; 
In forming new acquaintances be careful what you do,

met while at the Matinee. 
FORTUNE IN THE FIRE. 
Sweet Norah, come here, and look into the fire, 
Perhaps in its embers good look we may see; 
Don't come too near, or your glances so burning, 
Will put it clean out, like the sunbeams, machree. 
Just look ' tweea the bars, where the black sod is smoking, 
There's a 
sweet little valley, with rivers and trees. 
And a 
house on the bank quite as good as the squire's, 
Who knows but some day we'll have something like these— 
Who knows but, some day we'll have something like these? 
And now there's a 
coach with four galloping horses, 
A coachman to drive, and a 
footman behind, 
That shows that some day we will keep a 
fine carriage, 
And fly through the street at the speed of the wind. 
As Dermot was speaking, the rain drops came hissing 
Down thro' the wide, chimney, the fire went out; 
While mansion and river, and horses and carriage. 
All vanished in smoke- wreaths that whirl'd about, 
All vanished in smoke- wreaths that whirl'd about. 
Then Norah to Dermot this speech softly whispered, 
" 
Twere better to do than to idly desire ; 
And one little cot by the roadside is better 
Than a 
palace with servants and coach in the fire, 
Than a-paladewith-servants and coach in the fire."

And he'd give them their own with a

His scholars were: Jerry, Big Billy, and Ned, 
With Murrongli M'Carthy, Old Darby, and Ted, —

noise, 
He'd just give a

"I'll sit at the window," said Granny, 
And watch the garden gate, 
For I 
fancy that idle lad. sailor Dick, 
Will write to my bonnie Kate ; 
For she's mopml and sighed all day, 
Since the ships were sent away, 
And early or late. she looks at the gate, 
For the Post. I'll be bound to say, 
For the Post, 
be bound to say." 
But the twittering swallows under the cave 
Looked laughing- from their nest; 
For the birds and bees, and sighing trees, 
Soon whispered Granny to rest. 
And when by the rosemary bed, 
Kate heard the Postman's tread. 
Past Granny's closed eyes, she seized her prize 
And back to her spinning she sped, 
And back to her spinning she sped.

wander thro' the world, 
And meet with many a 
frown, 
No One seems to know me now, 
Because I'm brcken down. 
With an ample fortune 
I 
went it rather fast. 
The pace was almost killing, 
And I 
found it couldn't last. 
Too proud to put the curb on, 
I 
thought myself high-bred, 
And now, for want of bread' at times 
I 
have to ' fast' instead.

wander, ita.

How soon they changed their note

A

' 
Hard up,' yet ' Broken Down.'

As folks are bound to do-,

Cnottus.—My Nancy fair, ezc. 
I 
loved my Nancy- more than life, 
But if she'd loved me too, 
To ruin me at fancy fairs 
Was not the thing to do.;

A

parasol, 
And wooden parrot that you squeezed 
To croak out " Pretty poll."

-She talked about the naked blacks, 
And infant nigger boys, 
And how they ran about the Streets 
Without their -cordcroys; 
Mut when she'd cleared my pockets out, 
With face of gloom I 
heard my doom; 
She said quite fiercely, " Pray, move on, 
And don't take up the room." 
Spoken.—Didn't I 
bless the horrid little niggers at Carribool 
Aint there enough blacks in London flying about 
Oh;

Nancy fair, dr.c. 
A 
ruined man, I 
blessed the blacks, 
And left the wretched place, 
And never since that day have I 
Beheld my Nancy's face; 
Although they call them fancy fairs, 
They're not ideal, but very real; 
Then when you visit fancy fairs, 
Be careful how you deal.

My heart still was easy, for Delia, my daisy, 
I 
footed a 
fortnight my darling to wed. 
My journey ended, my steps I 
soon wended, 
To the house of the loved one that stood on the hill, 
Our hearts light with joy, myself and Molloy, 
Drank health to each other till we had our fill. 
Arrived at the door, what coulcl I 
do more, 
But play off genteelly and send up my name; 
And instead of my dearest came one of the fiercest, 
An ugly old huckster, saying, " What do you recap..." 
Says I, " I 
am here, without dread or fear, 
For the hand of my darling, for that sure I-coma, 
Says he, " You can't have her, while me he did lather 
Till I 
called out for mercy and hollored with pain. 
0 
I'll have your life, for she is my wife, 
You scoundrel, how dare you, with rage he did spouts 
And I 
without fail, was marched off to jail. 
That ended my loving, and now I 
am out. 
TILE BELLS OF SHANDON. 
Composed by FATTIER PRour. 
With deep affection and recollection," 
.oftea think of those Shandon 
Whose sound so wild would, in days of childhood, 
'fling o'er my fancy their magic spells. 
On this I 
ponder, whereer I 
wander, 
And thus grow fonder, sweet Cork, of thos, 
With thy bells of Shandon, 
That sound. so grand on 
The pleasant waters of the river Lee. 
Fve heard bells chiming full many a 
clime in, 
Tolling sublime in Cathedral shrine, 
While at glibe rate brass tongues would vibrate; 
But all their music spoke not like thine 
Tor mem'ry, dwelling on each proud swelling 
Of the belfry knelling its bold notes free, 
Made the Bells of Shandon 
sound far more grand on 
The pleasant waters of the river Lee. 
I've heard bells tolling old Adrian's mole in— 
Their thunder rolling from the Vatican— 
Awl cymbals glorious, swinging uproarious 
In the gorgeous turrets of Notre-Dame; 
33ut thy sounds were sweeter than the dome of reas 
flings o'er the Tiber, pealing solemnly— 
Ohl the Bells of Shandon 
Sound far more grand on 
The pleasant waters of the river Lee. 
There's a 
bell in Moscow, while on tower and Kosice, 
In St. Sophia the Turkman gets; 
And loud in. air,calls men to prayer, 
From the tapering turrets of tall minarets; 
Such an empty phantom I 
freely grant them: 
let there's an anthem more dear 6 me— 
'Tis the Bells of Shandon, 
That sound inure grand on 
The pleasaut waters of the river Loot

Oh I 
sweet is the smile of the beautiful morn, 
As it peeps through the curtain of night,

Oh! Shamus O'Brien, why don't you come home, 
You don't how know happy I'll be;

I'll smile when you smile, and I'll weep when you weep,

Does the sea have such bright and such beautiful charms

Oh I 
Shamus O'Brien, I'm loving you yet, 
And my heart is still trusting and kind; 
It was you who first took it, and can you forget, 
That love for another you'd find ? 
No! no! if you break it with sorrow and pain, 
then have a

If you'll bring it to me, I'll mend it again, 
And trust it, dear Shamus, to you.

THE LADS WHO LIVE IN IRELAND.

ATIF.75 GROW. 
My name is Ned CrManney, I 
was born in sweet Killarney; 
I 
can fight, dance or sing, I 
can idough, reap or mow; 
And, if I 
met a 
pretty girl, I 
never practice blarney. 
I've something more alluring, which perhaps you'd like to know: 
I'm none of your Bulgrudderies, nor other shabby families, 
But can unto my pedigree a 
pretty title show: 
Oh! I'm of the O's and Mac's, and likewise the sturdy Whacks, 
C1101t1.79. 
That live and toil in Ireland, where the Apple Praties grow; 
That live and toil in Ireland, where the Apple Pratiesgrow.

could a 
deal relate, if I 
could but[race my pedigree: 
My Mother was a 
Hogan, but my Father I 
don't 'know; 
I've ninety-nine relations in a 
place they call Roscarberry, 
And each unto their name has a 
Mac or an 0; 
My Uncle was a 
Brallaghan, my Aunt she was a 
Callaghan: 
And as to my character, why, I 
can plainly show : 
l'm a 
rantin' rovin' blade, and I 
never was afraid; 
For, I 
was born in Ireland, &c. 
May Maven still protect our hospitable Country. 
Where first I 
drew my living breath, and heard its cocks to crow! 
Adieu to its green hills and its lovely bay of Bantry 
Where many a 
pleasant evening, my love and I 
did go. 
Where shmals of fish, so pleasantly, did sport about so merrily, 
Beneath its glassy surface, their wanton tricks to show. 
Oh ! those scenes I 
did enjoy, like a 
gay, unthinking boy, 
With the lads who live in Ireland, etc-. 
St. Patrick was our Saint, and a 
blessed man in truth, was he-; 
Great gifts unto our Country he freely did bestow ; 
He banished all the frogs and toads that sheltered in our Country 
And unto other regions it's they were forced "to go : 
There is one fact undoubtedly, that cannot contradicted be: 
For, trace the Irish history, and it will plainly show ; 
Search the universe all round, tighter fellows can't be found, 
Than the lads who live in Ireland, (tro.

Music by C.J. 
M
EM: 
ahe music of this song is published by OTTO SUMO, 189 West Ma-
moru Street, Bait., Md. Price 50 cents.) 
I'm a 
rovin' Irish Boy, 
I 
was christened Auckna-cloy 
With a 
turn o' the wrist 
My stick I 
twist, 
I 
am my mother's joy; 
I've thravelled many a 
mile, 
To win a 
coleen's smile 
With a 
love o' my heart, for them I'd part-,1 
And many an hour beguile.. 
But no 
Pin here to tell you all, 
The places I 
have been, 
And all the very funny things 
in my thravels I 
have seen. 
CHORUS. 
For I'm a 
rovin' Irish Boy, 
I 
was christened A 
nekna-cloy, 
With a 
turn o' the wrist 
My stick I 
twist, 
And Pm my mother's joy.—[Dance Garryowm1 
I've been to " La Belle France," 
Where the girls know how to dance; 
If I 
left the bogs 
Yet I 
couldn't ait frogs, 
Tho' I've often had a 
chance,
 ; 
Don't think that l 
am green, 
For in Germany I've been, 
Where sausages strong, 
And pretzels long, a 
yard or more rye seen-
Then into Roossia I 
have rushed, 
The land of furs and capes, 
The men all make the womcn`work, 
And the soldiers look like apes. 
For I'm a 
rovin' Irish Boy, 
I 
was christened A 
uckna-cloy. 
With a 
turn o' my wrist, 
My stick I 
twist, 
And I 
am my mother's joy. 
To China thin I 
wint 
And got my hearts contint 
Of the briny say. 
And wretch-ed bad tay 
Enough to make me squint; 
Japan then came in view, 
Be my sowl I 
saw that too, 
But yellow Jack nigh broke my back, 
That's why h 
look so blue. 
Then sailin' undlier stars and stripe* 
I 
reached Columbia's shore, 
And now .1 love the place so well, 
I'll never leave it more. 
Except the cry will be. 
"come Paddy, join with me 
And brave once more. 
The 
tlantie's roar. 
And make mild Ireland free."

M Y JAUNTING CAR, 
I'm Larry McCue, a 
boy so true, 
I 
belong to the Emerald Isle, • 
Your attention I 
crave, and 
chant you a 
stave, 
And perhaps it'll cause you to smile. 
I'm jolly and gay, the truth I 
say, and the girls 
both near and far, 
'Say it's quite a 
thrate just to take a 
sate, 
And a 
drive on my jaunting ear. 
Driving, jolting, driving on a 
jaunting car, 
CHORUS. 
For when I 
get a 
fare, I 
drive away dull care, 
As I 
sit on my jaunting car. 
The reins I 
grip, and I 
crack my whip 
And off goes my jaunting ear. 
In Dublin town, of great renown, 
You'll find me on the stand, 
On my ear so nate, just take a 
sate, 
Atal ill drive through the streets so grand. 
The sights so fine all others outshine 
No matter near or far, 
The reins 
grip, and crack my whip, 
And off flies my jaunting car, 
Driving, jolting, driving on a 
jaunting car. 
For when I 
get, &o. 
If a 
girl to your mind yon wish to find, 
Child Ireland's just the part; 
The Colleen fair, I 
do declare. 
Are sure to steal your heart. 
With glance so s'y, and beaming eye 
As bright as any star, 
By the powers of Jove, you'r sure to fall in love, 
If you drive on a 
jaunting car. 
For when I 
get, &a. 
So if you wish for sport, sure I'm the sort, 
Cm find yon lots of fun; 
I 
can sit on my yoke, and crack a 
joke, 
With any boy under the sun. 
I 
know well enough. where they sell good stuff; 
And the girls behind. the bar 
Can tell by my wink what sort of drink 
Can grease the wheels of my jaunting earl 
For when I 
get, &el 
PATRICK HAS LEFT ME. 
Och hone! now I'm alone, 
Sad is my heart, Patrick is gone 
Far, far o'er the wide sea, 
The billows are bearing my true love from me. 
Ah me! words cannot speak 
The grief that's consuming my once blooming cheek, 
Ne'er more joy I 
can know, 
No hand soothes my tears as they bitterly flow. 
Life seems dark as my dreams; 
Hope o'er my path no longer gleams ; 
Night breezes heed not my moan, 
For Patrick has left me, Patrick is gone ! 
Och hone! friends I 
have none, 
Death hides them all neath the cold stone, 
Save him on the rude main, 
Who knows not my sorrow nor hears me complain. 
Patrick ! why wast thou poor, 
And tempted to roam to a 
foreign shore? 
My heart seeks not to share 
The world's & tang treasure, if love be not there 
Ah me none shall e'er see 
how, day by day, I 
weep for thee, 
Heaven only hears my sad moan, 
For Patrick has left me, Patrick is gone I 
THE WILD ROSE OF ERIN. 
Her long raven locks in the night- wind was streaming 
As over the waters she mournfully gazed, 
The moonbeams around her were placidly beaming, 
That beautiful daughter of Erin was crazed ; 
She plucked a 
wild rose that in beauty was glowing, 
Then kissing it, bade the fair flower decay, 
And on the dark waves which were quietly flowing, 
The wild rose of Erin soon wither 'd 
away. 
Bright, beautiful type of a 
heart that was broken, 
The fair hand that cull'd and then left it to die, 
Was wood and was wen, but those vows kindly spoken, 
Deceived, and then left her 'mid sorrow to sigh ; 
'Twas far inom the spot where the shamrock was growing, 
Her false hearted lever had Mt her to stray, 
While on the dark waves which were quietly flowing, 
The wild rose of Erin soon wither'd away. 
WE HAVE LIVED AND LOVED TOGETHER. 
We have lived and loved together, 
Through many changing years ; 
We have shared each other's gladness, 
And wept each other's tears. 
I 
have never known a 
sorrow 
That was long unsoothed by thee, 
nit was long unsoothed by thee; 
For thy smile can make it summer, 
Where darkness else would be. 
Like the leaves that fall around us, 
In Autumn's fading hours, 
-kre the traitor smiles that darken, 
When the cloud of sorrow lowers; 
And though many such we've known, lovo, 
Too prone, alas I 
to range, 
Too prone, alas! to range, 
We both can speak of one, love, 
Whom time could never change.

GOOD-BYE, SWEETHEART, GOOD-BYE. 
The brig'itt stars fade, the morn is breaking, 
The dew-drops pearl each bud and leaf, 
And I 
from thee my leave am taking 
With bliss too brief, 
With bliss, with bliss too brief. 
How sinks my heart with fond alarms, 
The tear is hiding in mine eye : 
For, time cloth thrust me from thine arms: 
G-ood-bye, sweetheart, good-bye! 
Good-bye, sweet-heart, good-bye 
For, time cloth thrust me from thine arms, 
Good-bye, sweetheart, good-bye I 
The sun is up, the lark is soaring, 
Loud swells the song of chanticleer; 
The lev'ret bounds o'er earth's soft flooring, 
Yet I 
am here, 
Y-t 
CTiTin here, yet I 
am here. 
For, since night's gems from heaven did fade 
And morn to floral lips cloth hie, 
I 
could not leave thee, though I 
said: 
" 
Good-bye, sweetheart, good-bye, 
.Good-bye, sweetheart, good-bye." 
I 
could not leave thee, though I 
said: 
" 
Good-bye, sweetheart, good-bye."

THE IDOL OF THE DAY.—[CONCLUDED.] 
Now " After Dark" I 
like to roam, 
And have a " Loving Cup," 
Or at the hunt, I'm quite " at home," 
And with the master sup. 
I'm sweet on " Rural Felicity," 
Can course, when I've the chance; 
And as to give a " Blow for Blow," 
Why, I'm par excellence. 
Spoken—Yes, every fellow ought to stand up in defence of the 
fair sex from a 
Peeress to 
Lancashire Lass," even though she 
be a " Woman of the World," or a " Girl of the Period."—Cuonus, 
as before. 
At Cambridge I 
gain'd a ' B A," 
Was never reckon'd slow, 
And at the side of " Royalty," 
A " Standard" man to row, 
As Volunteer was in the " Queens," 
My military glance, 
Was noticed by the " Prince cf Wales," 
As quito par excellence. 
Spoken—Ah I I 
don't mean the, all! Tottenham Court Road 
Company—" Ours" is the, all I 
crack corps iu which—Cuoaus, as 
before. 
"St. James's" I've my chambers in, 
Duns can't make me retrench, 
A 
little Countess ru May Fair, 
Makes me au fait in French. 
No " Grecian " eye to ' Drury Lane," 
Where ballet girls do prance, 
To charm " Princesses," my finesse 
Is thought par excellence. 
Spoken—Some find in the " Bower" of the South a " Gallery 
of Illustratum," but give me the " Pavillion ' of the East in the 
"City of London," where I .,
.!an revel in an ' Alhambra" of de-
lights, f)r—Ciionns, as before, 
N.B.—The places here mentioned can be readily localized by the voca-
list, and the names of plays here mentioned can, of course, be changed so 
as to adapt the song to any place.

PAT'S PILGRIM OF LOVD 
RECITATIVE. 
Och, Biddy my swate darlin, I 
bawl in vain, 
Biddy, deer Biddy, liii wet through with rain, 
The dirty children mock me all around, 
And wid dear Biddy does each pig stye resound. 
Tim Cronin who lived by the Cow and Worsted Stocking, 
I 
met near the bog, at the end of the town, 
lie swore by the powers I 
desarved a 
decent knocking, 
lie was after knocking me up, but I 
knock'd the varmint down. 
Och, now Paddy says he, " what is it you'd be at ?" 
b'aith says I, " you would get around me, but yo see I've laid you 
flat," 
And remember when to Biddy's ye betake yersil 
There's sure to be a 
bating for the foe of Paddy Flinn. 
So I 
wished him better luck, and I 
left the spalpeen sprawling, 
And hasten'd to you Biddy, with a 
heart, love, so true. 
Thin listen to your Paddy while his tinder tale he' 3 
bawling, 
In this hard shower to let him stand, sure it is very. hard in you, 
But see the door is open, so 111 boldly venture in. 
Here's bad luck and betther manners to the foes of Paddy Flinn. 
But see, dzc.' 
MY EMMET'S NO MORE. 
Despair in her wild eye, a 
daughter of Erin 
Appear'd on the cliffs of the bleak rocky shore; 
Loose in the wind flow'd her dark streaming ringlets 
And heedless she ,gaz'd on the dread surge's roar. 
Loud rang her harp in wild tones of despairing ; 
The time pass'd away with the present comparing, 
And in soul-thrilling strains deeper sorrow declaring, 
She sang Erin's woes and her Emmet no more. 
0, Erin, my country, your glory's departed ; 
For tyrants and traitors have stabbed thy 'heart's core, 
Thy daughters have laved in the streams of affliction, 
Thy patriots have fled, or lie stretched in their gore, 
Ruthlets ruffians now prowl thro' thy hamlets forsaken, 
From pale hungry orphans their last morsel have tal;en; 
The screams of thy females no pity awaken ; 
Alas I 
my poor country, your Emmet's no more. 
Brave was his spirit, yet mild as the Brahmin, 
His heart bled in anguish the wrongs of the poor; 
To relieve their hard sufferings he bray'd every danger, 
The vengeance of tyrants undauntedly bore. 
E'en before him the proud titled villains in power 
Were seen, though in ermine, in terror to cower : 
But alas ! he is gone—he has fallen a 
young flower. 
They have merder'd my Emmet, my Ernmers no more.

Whin I

But let that day go by; 
Whin I 
got to the door, 
Nelly sez; I'm poor! 
Then, my love, sez I, good-bye I 
For, I

You're an Irish girl; 
So, you don't come over me. 
Oh I

About the wake of Mr. O'Leary.

The minstrel boy to the war is gone, 
In the ranks of death you'll find him ; 
His father's sword he's girded on, 
And the wild harp strung behind him. 
Land of song— said the warrior bard, 
Though all the world betray thee, 
One s..:ord at least its right shall guard, 
One faithful harp shall praise thee. 
The minstrel fell, hut tl:e foeman's chains 
Could not keep his proud soul under ; 
The Imp he loved

And said : ' no chain-: shall sully thee,

They shall never sound in slavery 1"

in his represention of the Emperor Napoleon III.] 
All Europe's standing armies are at present standing still, 
And I'm quite at peace with all the world, tho' 11:Inch against 
my will. 
So I've laid.my swOrd upon my shelf and taken up my pen, 
Just to show that even Emperors can be useful now and then.

To a 
littel ancient history, describing the career, 
Of the Me lamented Cresar, who, I 
think you'll all agree, 
Was exactly like nry uncle and very much like me. 
Air—" Home, Sweet Home." 
Of all romantic capitals, abroad or at home, 
For deep classic interest there's no place like Rome; 
'Twas there, two thousand years ago, as all the school-books 
say, 
The subject of this brief memoir first saw the light of day. 
Air—" 
Paddle your own Canoe." 
He travell'd about in various parts, of adventures he saw a 
few, 
And, self-reliant, quite clearly he learned to paddle his own 
canoe; 
his wants were small, he cared not at all, if his debts were 
discharged when due; 
And if history aint trash, he always paid cash, and nc'er gave

Then he joined the army, and soon rose to co mman d 
die forces 
too, 
And now, launched well on he ocean of life he paddled his 
own canoe. 
Air—" The Tight Little Island." 
He thought it exciting to go in for fighting, 
And after some battles on dry laud. 
To Britain sailed over, and, landing at Dover, 
Walled into that tight little Island. 
"This snug little, tight little island,

Bat while he worried those Picts and Scots, 
And was putting them all to slaughter ; 
His hosts were busily hatching plots 
On the other side of the water; 
But when exsar return'd poor Pompey learn'd, 
The folly of turning traitor, 
For he and his friends came to very bad ends, 
While Csar became Dictator. 
Air—" One Bumper at Parting." 
Now a 
certain young person callad Brutus, 
Observ'd to a 
crony one day; 
" 
This is hardly the right man to suit us, 
So let's put him out of the way." 
His friend, whose cognomen was Cassius, 
Replied ( very shrewdly indeed); 
"But Ccesar will certainly smash us 
Supposing we shouldn't succeed." 
Now Brutus, as history mentions, 
Was Ctesar's " particular friend," 
So his rather unfriendly intentions 
One cannot at all comprehend !

The death of Nelson." 
'Twas on the fifteenth day of March they found a

To put their plans in force ; 
They ran our hero thro', a 
dozen times or two, 
Which did for him, of course ! 
And so this high and mighty swell, 
As dead as Julius Cesar fell, 
Exclaiming et tu Brute:

0— 
A great sea story—written as Ingraham only knew how to 
write. 
It tells of clipper-schooners—Spanish pirates—honest 
seamen—red-handed buccaneers, and all sorts of wild fights and 
desperate adventures. 
But it also gives a 
glowing narration of a 
beautiful love story—seen through the meshes of dark, terrible 
and bloody deeds, as the bright plumes of birds of Paradise are 
seen to dart amidst the gloomy poisonous foliage of the deadly 
Upas tree.
