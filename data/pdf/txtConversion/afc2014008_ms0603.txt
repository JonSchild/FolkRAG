Anthropology thus far has failed to find a way to foster the develop-
ment of cultural diversity, man's principal technique of adaptation and the
 
source of all his creations.
 
This situation is particularly marked in America, the land of sub-
cultures, where the flexibility of the work force is a testament to the
 
diverse origins of its population.  Here a dom
inant and ever-narrowing main-
stream culture leaves little room for the healthy continuing growth of the
 
sub-cultures which have given America its varied expressive and creative
 
tradition.
 
The knowledge and the data, collected f
_uii our minorities, circulates
 
in the academic and fine arts world, but scarcely impinges upon the sub-
groups f
icxii which this value-laden and morale-buildinq material canes.  our
 
first obligation as et}-
.noscientists is to return what we have collected and
 
what we know to the human ccnmunities who need it most, and at the same
 
time to validate the life-styles, which have been neglected and denigrated.
 
After all the emphasis on black studies, for exaliple, most blacks do not
 
share the heritage of Herskovits and his students.
 
The ethnicities have been handled by sociologists and linguistic and
 
political, rather than as cultural groups, with an enormous potential con-
tribution--in terms of their linguistic expertise, for example.
 
Indians have little sense of their total cultural heritage, of their
 
long-teini contribution toward making this continent habitable, of the unities
 
underlying their varied traditions.  Even Wasps and Latins lack a perspective
 
on the ancient European origins of their life-styles and the sources of their
 
life-styles and their folkways.
 
Every American culture that lacks access to the main cultural feedback
 
systems--the schools, the universities, the media--is b-ing phased out.  The
 
need is for the ethnoscientists to assist sub-cultures in maximal high quality
 
access to these resources.  The result for local, regional, national and
 
family morale will be guaranteed.
 
A number of practical questions are involved.  Applied work of this
 
sort tends to have a low level of prestige in all the professions where
 
- 2 -
 
cultural expertise is located--ethnomusicology, folklore, anthropology.
 
The result is that the most talented culturologists and their best students
 
do not take up these challenges;  yet the intellectual challenge of this
 
work requires encyclopedic knowledge, great intellectual creativity, and
 
high motivation.  The consciousness of the technosciences must be raised
 
so that the best minds in the f
ield confront these problems.
 
At present, a considerable amount of government money is spent in
 
what s
cene believe to be a discoordinated and quite chaotic way by numbers
 
of agencies.  If the field were better coordinated, if our field could
 
develop a concerted plan and approach, it could vastly raise the level
 
of work now being done at national, regional, state and local levels.
 
The a
ims of the conference are:
 
1
)  To allow a group of the best ethnoscientists to report on their
 
grassroots work all over the country.  The gamut of these reports are en-
visioned to range from a survey of regional culture, to a report of Chicano
 
culture, and one on a modern black folk drama as a source of morale in the
 
black camnzni
ity.  Some of the invitees know each other;  most do not.  Their
 
caning together will, we believe, generate a movement,  Their combined
 
reports could give rise to a fabulous book.  The sparks from the meeting
 
could generate other such sessions at the meetings of the separate disciplines.
 
2
)  To critically evaluate and, in a real sense, bless this unfash-
ionable but vital new direction in cultural ecology by bringing a group of
 
prestigious senior scholars as discussants and "
summer-uppers."
 
3
)  To provide an integrated basis which could aid in generating a
 
policy for this field which would be helpful to agencies such as the National
 
EndoTnent for the Arts, the Dept. of the Interior, etc.  Development of heri-
tage policy must have the input of the best scientists and activists in our
 
fields.
 
4
)  To motivate symposia in the relevant meetings such as ethnomusicology,
 
folklore, anthropology, applied anthropology.
 
5
)  To develop plans that will lead to the employment of more trained
 
culturologists at the local, state and regional levels as qrassroots workers
 
towards the maintenance of cultural equity.
