Summary of Interview: Erin Neely talks about working for most of her career in a state 
psychiatric hospital. She emphasizes the important of humor and joking among colleagues to 
deal with the stress of mental health nursing. She provides several stories that illustrate 
teamwork, the violence at the hospital, and the way they use joking to cope. She describes 
building rapport with patients and also the training that she underwent at the hospital. She works 
at the same location but not with patients; she’s a utilization review nurse.

Born in Waukesha, Wisconsin. Moved to Neenah, between Oshkosh and 
Appleton. Lived here for whole life.

Mother worked at hospital; ran EEG department. Loved the whole “scene” of the 
hospital; I would go and pick her up. “And it wasn’t so much nursing; it was just 
the scene, the hospital. I just dug it. It was cool.” Liked the “structure” of it, and 
“not that my mom held some high position, but she gave me a very good work 
ethic, and you could see that in everything she did, and everybody loved my 
mom. You could just see that—she was just the shit, you know? [laughs] So I just 
thought it was a neat—and she cared for people. And I think I have always been 
like that, even as a child, with animals and stuff. And the older I got, the more I 
was drawn to that, taking care of the underdog. It just seemed like the right thing 
to get into.” 
0.02.32 
Graduate 1986 from high school, and although had scholarship at UW-Oshkosh, 
didn’t feel was prepared for college. Worked waitressing jobs, 3-4 at a time, and 
after a few hours, decided to return to college. Started at technical college, due to 
financial constraints. Got hired as a nursing assistant and landed on behavioral 
health unit at Theta Clark. Was not yet done with clinical rotations, but really 
wanted to be a labor and delivery nurse. Wasn’t going to have kids and thought 
that would be focus. First patient at OB unit was mom who had to deliver stillborn 
twins, “and I just thought I can’t do this. I was thinking all this glamorous, 
happiness, and family time, and you were going to be a part of that, and when I 
saw the opposite side of that, I just thought, ‘I don’t think I can do this.’ I’m not 
very good with death.” Went from one rotation to another, but then did psych 
rotation at Mercy Medical Center in Oshkosh, “and it was almost like [angelic] 
‘Aaaaah’ … and it literally felt home to me—the chaos and the noise and 
whatever—and I kind of come from a chaotic background, maybe that’s why. 
And they didn’t scare me.” Decided then to get into the psych side rather than 
medical. Got Associate’s degree and started working at Theta Clark. “A bunch my 
friends worked there, and to me, this place was like One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s 
Page 2 of 9 
 
Nest and there’s no way I’m going to work here, and it’s too unsafe, and people 
are always getting hurt, but my friends talked me into it, and 24 years later, I’m 
still here.” 
0.06.33 
On people being terrified on psych units: “Psych units are scary in hospitals. 
People can be super-aggressive. Back then we could chemically restrain patients, 
given them drugs to calm them down. We can’t do that anymore. They’d be 
walked around with the—something shuffle. And they’d look right through you, 
like that thousand-yard stare. And it’s just a scary place to be. And you don’t 
know if they’re having hallucinations, responding to internal stimuli, and it’s just 
not that easy a place to be. And I thought, ‘I’m digging this.’ And people like that 
seem to talk to me and trust me. Even outside of work, it seems like people are 
drawn to me that are a little bit the oddballs. It always kind of is that way. I don’t 
know what about me says, ‘Hey, go talk to her.’ But it’s been like that my whole 
life. But where my friends were super-easy, it just felt like where I needed to be.” 
0.08.39 
On building rapport: “That was hard because everybody is different, and you 
don’t know what to say. And you could say something one day and then the next 
day say the same thing and people would react differently … So, I think part of it 
is just learning to read people. And even as young child, I think I could do that. 
So, I think part of it is just part of me. But then you do learn some stuff in school: 
you almost have like a script in your head … if they have something behind their 
back or in their head, you almost try to get them to trust you … always say the 
same thing, and steer how that patient is going.” “Or I’ve been attacked a handful 
of times a handful of times—multiple times.” This happened less at Theta 
Clark—patients would come in on emergency detentions, but less violence. This 
contributed to interviewee’s early thought that Winnebago was where the “’bad’ 
patients—or difficult patients, I should say” were sent. Variation in what’s 
effective: e.g., physical touch or not. “It’s a vibe you get from the other person—I 
think you just learn it as you go.” 
0.11.21 
Training includes a lot of roleplay, including CPM (Crisis Prevention 
Management)—interviewee now runs this training—teaching how to de-escalate 
patients verbally. Interviewee learned a lot through this. Also “learned a ton 
watching some of the seasoned nurses. They seemed so comfortable in their place. 
‘She was born to do this job’ sort of thing. And now people say that about me. 
But I definitely wasn’t like that in the beginning—I was afraid of my own 
shadow. And when you get hurt too, that’s another side of thing—people say, 
‘Aren’t you angry with the patient?’ Some people will file a complaint against the 
patient … I feel like this is my job, this is my calling. Patients who hurt me, I’ll sit 
down and play cards the next day. I have been hurt really bad, but the next day I 
just do it. I think it’s like a civil service sort of thing, and I think a lot of people 
feel that way. Our patients are really ill, and it just takes work.” Even though can’t 
do some of the restraint techniques, feels that there’s still scope for creativity in 
reducing conflict. 
0.13.47 
“And I am all about putting out fires—putting out small fires on the unit before 
they get bigger. You know, that was another thing I was good at—you could 
sense—you could walk onto the unit and feel, ‘Things are just not right today.’” 
Has mostly worked with adults—younger adults. 
Page 3 of 9 
 
0.14.19 
On the sensation of ‘something not being right’: “It’s like a super-tense feeling, 
almost like a darkness, where you just know—like a vibe of chaos or something’s 
not right, you know. And you can almost pinpoint who—maybe one, maybe 
multiple people. And I always try to separate them or engage them in 
conversation or an activity.” Feels that electronic health record, which was made 
to be paper-compliant and more efficient, has gotten away from one-to-one care 
for the patients, “which is super-upsetting to me, because that was how I did my 
job … You could see someone gearing up, and you’d get them outside to play 
some basketball and use up some of that energy … And you could probably ask 
any nurse in this hospital, ‘Is it going to be a good night tonight?’ and they’ll say 
yes or no. It’s just a feeling, and it can change, but you know it the minute that 
you walk on. You hear report from the shift that’s finishing and you’re just like, 
‘It’s going to be a bad night.’” 
0.16.21 
On reports between shifts that sends informal signals: For patients that are longer-
term (6-7 months), “you were like their family, you know”, so would know more 
of background causes or “trigger” for individual patients. So, during reports, 
could find out these kinds of facts—a bad day in court, or a phone call with father. 
“And that would be the first patient I would go too.” “And no kidding, if the 
Packers lose, our patients can be out of control sometimes. And it’s kind of a 
laughable thing but it just shows the defiance and the twisted way our patients 
look at things. What’s important to them is not as important to us. But you have to 
keep it in mind, because if they know you don’t think it’s important, you’re going 
to have issues. So, it’s just kind of like this game you play with the patients, it’s 
almost like this little dance—they’re going to manipulate you when they can. 
And, you know, if I was patient here, I would try to manipulate you, you know? ‘I 
want this, this and this.’ You know, we tell them when to eat, we tell them when 
to shower, when to use the bathroom, when to sleep, when to take their meds. In 
trying to keep a structured environment, we make them institutionalized, you 
know. And that’s not what we want to do, but that’s what happens. That’s the 
realistic way to look at it. What if someone told you to do that every day? Not to 
mention—these patients take so many meds, I would be in a coma.” Feels that the 
number of directions, every day, and the constant supervision means that “I just 
have so many mixed feelings about it. And the older I get—after 24 years—the 
more relaxed I get about it. When I started, I was on a behavior modification unit. 
So, it was just very structured. ‘You do this, you get this.’ ‘You do this, this is the 
consequence.’ It was never a punishment; it was a consequence. And we had way 
less staff back then—I’d have three RCTs—now they’re called PCTs—resident to 
psychiatric care technicians. And we’d have four or five restraints a shift [to stop 
them hurting themselves or staff]. Now they have to be in view the whole time 
they’re in restraints. So, we need way more staff to do way less work. So, it just is 
what it is. It’s just kind of disappointing from the way it was to the way it is now. 
But I don’t think we spend as much time with the patients as we used to. I used to 
play a card game with a patient every night … It was just two people chilling out 
in the day room, and that’s how you build rapport. These are people who have 
been sexually abused or neglected, and very low frustration tolerance, and you 
Page 4 of 9 
 
have to wade through all that garbage. And you may the first person in their life 
they have been able to trust.” 
0.22.43 
Did staff nursing for 14 years, and then got hurt bad—“I got stabbed”. Had to 
have sutures. “And then a few weeks later I got both of my shoulders dislocated 
by a patient, and I just thought, ‘I can’t do this anymore. They’re going to take me 
out of her in a body bag’ kind of thing. And I didn’t want to—I loved psych 
nursing. I did not want to walk away from it. I was angry kind of. I’ve just 
dedicated my life to this position, and I was good at it. And I took interns over the 
summers, and did all the training of new nurses, and was on every committee. 
And I love what we stand for, that we help that kind of underdog, you know? 
People that are—there’s such a stigma with mental illness. And I always felt that 
we were doing such a great job. And I’d gotten hurt multiple times, but those two 
were the worst. And I went home that day after I got stabbed, and I had two small 
children, and they were terrified. I looked like I’d been attacked by a vicious 
animal, and they didn’t want me to go to work. And it was horrible, because I was 
like, ‘This is my life; I don’t really know anything else.’” 
0.24.38 
The medical director suggested a new job that hadn’t been filled, needing a 
“bulldog who can handle this”, the utilization nurse. Had this job for past 10 
years. Five years ago, Shelley, another utilization review nurse, joined the team. 
Job is to prove medical necessity for patients in residence. All 72 counties in 
Wisconsin send patients to institution for this assessment. Felt that had to figure 
out how to do this new job, entirely alone. After working on a team, took a while 
to adjust while also healing from the injuries.  
0.27.00 
Had gone back to school, since only had Associate’s degree, but later got 
bachelor’s degree, but didn’t go further for personal reasons. “It’s an interesting 
change—a whole different kind of nursing. I never ever thought I would do it, but 
I love it. And you do have to know psych and patients and actually our staff to do 
a good job, or I don’t think you’d ever get anything covered.” 
0.28.03 
Before interviewee took role, the hospital didn’t think it was a position that 
needed to be filled. The admissions staff would answer a few questions, look at a 
24-hour, and make a quick determination about why patient was there. But 
nothing like the work a utilization review nurse would do, taking a more synoptic 
view of the patient and what’s being done and what needs to be done. 
0.29.38 
200 patients in whole hospital, maybe 70 of whom have insurance; so, 70 patients 
have to have medical necessity review. Another difference in this institution is 
that there are 25 intakes and 18 discharges a day; so, a lot of movement to keep 
track of. And with private insurance, that information has to be kept—companies 
will cover first 72 hours of emergency detention, but then company has to be 
contacted for further approval. “And they’re not the nicest to work with—they 
don’t want to pay for the patient. And it’s different when it’s medical facility, in 
for a knee replacement, and it’s three days and you’re in and out … But with 
mental health, if I’m depressing, I might snap out of it in two weeks, you might 
snap out of it in two years … There’s such a gray area in mental, it’s not black 
and white. I can’t say that someone who comes in with this code, that they’re 
going to be out in a week. And I think it’s ridiculous, but that’s what we have to 
do, every day, to prove that they need to be here.” 
Page 5 of 9 
 
0.32.59 
“We’re kind of like the bottom of the barrel—you don’t really want to be in this 
facility. And we’re a locked facility. You may not be suicidal, but you still are 
showing signs of serious depression. So, you’re still not okay for us to open the 
door, so you still need a step-down.” Population also includes children from 
horribly dysfunctional situations, so we have to let them go back to that crazy, 
chaotic environment. Feels like there’s a “revolving door.” “Some patients get 
very comfortable here; we start to be like their family. So, if it gets bad on the 
outside, some people will do what they need to get back here. It’s a manipulation 
thing again.” Traumatic events can also trigger someone to be back where they 
felt safe—which is sometimes this institution. Also sometimes get a pre-
admission screening, which gives insight into the triggering event that caused 
patient to return. Interviewee nearly always works with ‘civil,’ not ‘forensic’ 
patients. But forensic patients might, say, have to do 30 years after being found 
not guilty by reason of mental defect. So, although not a psych hospital and not a 
residential place, people are at institution for a long time and “do their time 
here—people die here.”   
0.36.20 
This institution has both males and females, unlike Mendota, and “they’re 
supposed to be our sister institution, but it feels like they’re not, and you’d think 
as state hospitals, we’d have to play by the same rules, but it’s not. And we’re like 
the redheaded stepchildren, and I don’t know why! That’s like a joke, of course, 
just between state employees … And I cannot tell you over the years how many 
people have said, ‘Where do you work?’ ‘Winnebago Mental Health Institute.’ 
‘Oh, I’m so sorry!’ And I’m like, ‘I love my job! Don’t feel sorry for me.’ And 
somebody has to do this. It isn’t for everyone. I do the CNA testing for the new 
CNAs coming in, and you can almost tell from the first day which ones are going 
to make it and which not. But I’ve often said, this job isn’t for everyone.” Can be 
especially difficult to see self-harm—“stuff you would never see in a normal job, 
and we can teach you how to protect yourself and those things, but it’s almost like 
a PTSD—every day, something major happening, aggression, and it’s just a scary, 
dark place. And we use humor a lot. And I think without that we wouldn’t 
survive. I mean, I used humor when I was a staff nurse with the patients. I even 
have to do it sometimes with those insurance people because they’re so hostile.” 
0.39.15 
On using humor and how it helps: “Oh, geez. I mean, with my peer group, with 
other nurses. So, the other day, we had an incident where a patient was rectal 
digging. Which is not pleasant. Because poop out of water, there’s nothing like it, 
the smell is foul. But not only was he rectal digging, he was making snowballs—
or poopballs. And we all had to get gowned up, and … I don’t want to touch it, 
it’s disgusting. And we have little jokes, if somebody gets it thrown at them, you 
make a little joke about it, you make light of it—not in front of the patient, 
obviously—but you have make a joke out of it, the crazy shit we see on a daily, 
because I think you’d literally go crazy. So, for a couple of days after that, we’d 
ask them if they were having snowball sandwiches for lunch. You know? … But 
not only that, when you get into a situation where there’s a lot of blood, our blood 
or theirs, regardless. You don’t make light of it because you don’t take it 
seriously. You make light of it to try to find some sunshine in the darkness; you 
know what I mean? And you can see when one of your peers is having a really 
Page 6 of 9 
 
tough time or when a new employee gets hurt or sees something very traumatic to 
them, you just kind of know that they need a little pick-me-up. So, I used to bring 
in maybe some—I’m a queen at making cupcakes, that’s my thing, cupcakes. So, 
after a really bad day, I’d bring in cupcakes, just to show that I appreciate you and 
know that we’re all in the small boat. It’s how you internalize it, you know.”  
0.42.34 
Feels that couldn’t have gotten through job without coworkers. “You get on a unit 
and there’s almost this immediate cohesion, and it has to be like that, or you 
wouldn’t be able to survive.” Feels there’s important trust that other nurses can 
read signals and look out for each other. 
0.43.40 
Feels that much less hands-on interaction with patients now than previously.  
0.43.55 
On telling jokes to cope: one patient had a bag attached that she could empty on 
her own; one day, interviewee had the sense that something was going on and was 
“game-y” in the courtyard—normally used for games and cookouts. Patient 
wasn’t following directions and started running away. On the way into building, 
snapped off antenna on stereo in the courtyard and jammed it into her stoma, in an 
attempt to perforate her bowel; this was her plan. In chase with patient, 
interviewee had to hold it there and try not to pull it out. Interviewee had ‘garage 
door opener’ type device, that generated huge response. She and another 
employee were trying to support antenna in woman’s stoma and dealing with the 
unpleasantness of fecal matter. “You know, it’s constant chaos.” But patient 
yanked out the antenna, emptying contents of bag onto interviewee and another 
nurse. Interviewee had to replace her clothes with patient’s clothes, a NASCAR 
T-shirt and a huge pair of sweatpants. Since other things were now happening, 
and patient was on way to ER to have surgery, a new employee said, ‘Stop 
running in the hall!’ thinking interviewee was a patient! [laughs] “And for years I 
heard about that … So, you kind of find some funny stuff. It’s constant chaos, so 
you just find humor every day.” After this, would sometimes have NASCAR 
model cars, calling back to this. 
0.49.45 
“I’m closer to some of these people than to my own family. You spend so much 
time with the same people. I’m just so grateful.” Notes that union job has been 
replaced with non-union, after political events, in some good ways and some bad. 
Feels that this changed the dynamics of the institution: union jobs keep some 
people in jobs who shouldn’t be in the job—“it’s got a way of protecting the bad 
guys, who could be the best people in the world, but suck to work with.” Also 
changed financial situation in a less positive way, including benefits and 
retirement, reducing competitiveness with private facilities. “I’m 50 years old, 
and I don’t want to leave here. I feel like I’ve dedicated myself to this facility, and 
I want to retire from here. I can technically retire with a full pension after 30 
years” but want to wait to retire with some coworkers. Also feels that has type-A 
personality and “I wonder can I handle not working. And who knows, I might 
retire and then end up coming back.” This is a regular occurrence—“it’s like a 
joke, an ongoing joke, ‘Why do you retire and then come back part-time?’” Feels 
that would prefer to transfer knowledge, leave, and enjoy family and life, move 
somewhere warm, and eat, drink and be merry, if decided to retire. 
0.54.37 
On first impressions: “Actually, I didn’t [immediately click with people].” Started 
on behavior modification unit. Worked with very seasoned nurses, and as rookie 
Page 7 of 9 
 
nurses, “these are some seasoned women who didn’t take any shit. They were not 
warm and fuzzy. They scared me, to be quite honest. I mean, I called them ‘Nurse 
Ratchett,’ from One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest. But I learned more from that 
group of women than from anyone else.” Was initially inclined to try things from 
a softer angle, and would be allowed space to experiment, but found that “you just 
have to be [harsh] sometimes.” Is now friends with some of these women, who 
still work here. Was recently reminded of an error where forgot to fill out 
instruction slip to pharmacy. “And she reamed me out so bad—she came at me 
very aggressively. And I thought, ‘Oh my god, this woman is literally going to 
beat my ass.’ And that’s how she was with anything.” Got over being scared very 
quickly; felt that just couldn’t be meek. Feels that all are ‘cut from the same 
cloth,’ and that this is necessary for patient and staff safety. Doesn’t think would 
have been as good a nurse without those teachers. 
0.58.43 
On nurse personality: Doesn’t think all psych nurses are all type-A personalities. 
A joke in the institution is the stereotype of social workers as ‘hippie,’ 
‘Birkenstock-wearing.’ And a similar stereotype about psych nurses as 
opinionated, know jobs well, and ‘control freaks.’ Feels that you ‘know’ which 
group it is, when they get together. Had a strange social interaction in which many 
of the people interviewee had been close to initially were on the cusp of 
retirement. When switched to favorite role—developmental disorder—felt very at 
home with coworkers. At TLC unit, developmentally disabled patients, who just 
wanted to be close—took interviewee a while to readjust to these patients where 
you could be gentler or softer. But by this time, interviewee felt “super-confident” 
and felt that “I would survive it.”  
1.02.12 
In another incident, a patient grabbed interviewee’s nipple and tore it. People 
[jokingly] called interviewee ‘Nipple’ for years afterwards. Although not funny at 
the time—raised risk of breast cancer and was “black and blue” for months—but 
the name stuck. “And you just gotta know what it came from to know that it’s 
funny … You don’t laugh about it, but you have to make light of it, because I 
survived, the patient was okay, and we got through it. And sometimes I think, 
‘You don’t pay me enough for this,’ but it’s the job, and it doesn’t happen all the 
time. It’s all about how you react … And above all, you just need to be nice. The 
people here work a lot of hours and they have so many reasons to be disgruntled, 
but they keep it together and they’re good to the patients.” 
1.04.34 
On the stereotype or criticism of nurses ‘sitting around playing cards’: “It’s so 
much more than that. You do that, but you want—here, at least—these patients, 
the ones here longer-term, have no support. They get no visits, phone calls, they 
don’t have anyone. So, you grow like a professional relationship with these 
patients, but the patients look at you like family … And I always try to put myself 
in their position. Do I really want to talk about what brought me here and that my 
dad sexually molested me? No. I just sometimes want to talk or to play rummy. 
And we had a karaoke machine: that was always a blast. And we actually would 
pick up on patients who had great voices … And I just feel that it is me more than 
playing cards with a patient. It’s so much more than that. It’s hope for them, and 
care for them, and looking beyond their mental illness. That’s a person. And that 
could be me, or you, or my mother or sister, and I want them to be treated well. 
Page 8 of 9 
 
And if that means sitting down and listening to their story—even if it’s one I can’t 
follow—that’s it. And that seems nuts, that someone would say that—so 
offensive.” Took this as an important time to be spent with patient in ‘down-time’ 
when no emergencies were taking place. “There’s a person inside there, and you 
need to treat them as such, because that’s how you would like to be treated.” 
1.08.28 
On stigma about mental health: “I think that’s a huge part of it. I think mental 
health awareness is better, but we should be farther along than we are, because 
people who have mental illness that have to be on meds for the rest of their 
lives—you would never turn their nose up at a diabetic who has to take 
medication the rest of their lives. But someone who has to take an antidepressant 
or antipsychotic, you would never treat someone else the way you treat someone 
with mental illness, you wouldn’t. It wouldn’t be appropriate. And it’s upsetting 
to those of us who have worked there … And I don’t know anyone who hasn’t 
had something—a death in the family. You need it. So, let’s just embrace it and 
work through it.” 
1.10.21 
On the stigma being transferred to mental health nurses: Workers lived here, and 
surgeries used to be performed. There’s even a cemetery with patients’ numbers 
and records listed; there’s still a list of who these people are. It’s sad. One patient 
cut his penis off because Jesus told him to, so you had some experience with 
surgical work. But had felt like had gone from modern place to something from 
nineteenth century. And even interviewee herself had this attitude to some degree 
before starting—associating it with Jack Nicholson and One Flew Over the 
Cuckoo’s Nest and worrying about losing nursing skills. But found this not at all 
true: constantly called on to use a variety of nursing skills. “But I think that, 
although we should be supportive of each other, nurses outside of psych aren’t as 
supportive. I think they look at it as ‘You’re not a real nurse.’ That’s strange 
because we all took the same Boards. And some ER nurses don’t have great 
bedside manner—because those people are in and out and you’re taking care of 
the crisis and getting them out—so I could be just as judgment and say that. And 
I’m trying to be funny, but I could say the same thing about them … When I 
worked at Theta Clark and couldn’t get an IV started, I could call down and get 
someone to come out. And when the ER had an aggressive patient, they would 
call us. So, within one hospital it worked well. But between hospitals? No. And I 
do believe there is a stigma, because the nurses here ‘don’t do real nursing stuff.’ 
But find me a nurse who doesn’t assess, diagnose, implement, evaluate. We all 
do. We all have to. You know? And we also have, you know, that we don’t do 
often—like IVs, and we do yearly competencies, and monthly education tests, and 
we do a lot of education, always trying to do best practice. We have to do those 
things. So, it goes with the stigma of mental illness ‘isn’t really’ an illness. ‘Just 
brush it off. You don’t really have anxiety because I can’t see it in your.’ So that 
whole part is upsetting. It’s like we’re constantly fighting for the rights of the 
mentally ill. And this is 2019. We should be much farther along than we are, but 
we’ve made some strides, so thank God for that. The patients also have a lot more 
rights than they used to. A husband could throw his wife in here, and say she was 
insane for whatever reason, and keep her here her whole life.” Similarly, for 
epilepsy. “We’ve come a long way … but I just wish in the perfect world, nurses 
Page 9 of 9 
 
would support nurses, whatever your specialty. And women would support 
women, whatever your situation is—I know that there’s a lot of male nurses too.
