OPINIONS OF THE PRESS 
On the Performances of " The Berrys," 
MR. JACOB AND MISS BELLE. 
The new stars, Mr. Jake and Miss Belle Berry, enjoyed a 
reception 
which must have been quite satisfactory to them at the Opera House last 
night. 
Miss Belle, who is a 
charming blonde of some eighteen years, and 
the possessor of a 
well moulded figure, astonished all by her versatile per-
formance. 
She made her entree in a 
song entitled " It seems odd to me," 
which for vocal precision and execution is unsurpassed. 
In response to an 
• 
enthusiastic encore she performed a 
clever banjo solo. 
The audience in-
sisted upon a 
third appearance, whereupon she manifested extraordinary 
skill at sleight of hand, and eclipsed the efforts of more pretentious ex-
pounders of that art. 
She retired from the stage amidst great enthusiasm, 
only to be again and again recalled. 
Later in the evening she appeared 
on the tight rope, and renewed the success of her previous efforts. 
Her 
wardrobe is gorzeous, and her fingers are literally covered with diamonds, 
which dazzled the eyes of all. 
The appearance of Jake Berry was the signal for a 
burst of laughter. 
He is at home in any character— Dutch, Irish, French, male or female. 
His changes are very rapid, his singing good, songs all new and dialect 
perfect. 
He more than sustained the great reputation that had preceded 
• 
him.—Scranton Daily Democrat, August 29, 1871. 
The Berrys appeared last night at the Theatre Comique to a 
crowded 
house. They need only to be seen to be appreciated. 
They are amongst 
the most successful stars that have graced the boards of our favorite resort 
this season.—Long Branch ( N. .1".) Daily News, June 18, 1371. 
The Berrys appeared last night at Smith's Opera House, in a 
new ver-
sion of" Rip Van Winkle." 
It excels anything of the kind we have ever 
seen. 
Mr. Berry claims its authorship. 
Dining the piece there is a 
great 
deal of singing and dancing. The jokes and witticisms of Mr. Berry are 
of the most amusing character, and caused the audience to yell with de-
light. 
The most affecting scene of the drama is that of the prayer of 
Minnie Van Winkle, admirably delivered by little Maud, a 
child of some 
six years. 
Mr. Berry has also a 
small trained dog, who played the part 
assigned him equally well. 
Miss Belle Berry, who appeared as Minnie 
Van Winkle in the second act, was attired in a 
gorgeous manner, and 
enacted the character as only one of her ability could enact it. 
The audi-
ence assembled was of the most fashionable description, and retired well. 
pleased with the performance.—Plyniouth Star, April 10, 1872. 
The Berrys appeared last night at Music Hall to the largest and most 
fashionable awlience ever assembled within its walls. 
Their performances 
are too well known to need comment; suffice it to say that they sustained 
their well-known reputation. 
John E. Owens will appear to-morrow 
night.—Republican, March 17, 1973. 
The Berrys reappeared at their Opera House last night in a 
musical 
melange, consisting of performances on various musical instruments, which 
were well rendered and well received.— Wilkesbarre Daily, Jan. 7, 1873.

Just for to see them run.

Oh now, let's make it lively, 
For we must cut and run; 
We'll meet again to-morrow, 
By the setting of the sun ; 
We'll tie the cat's tail to the dog, 
To hear dem mew and squall, 
And take de old cow's photograph, 
And paint it on de wall.

DASHING OCTOROON.

And when each dance is finished, 
We take a

Every one to see us pronounced the happy pair.

NUMBER SksvEN SHOE. 
SONG iND Daxes. 
Tux subject of my song is not so very new, 
'Tis of a 
handsome yellow gal I 
love so fond and true, 
Her eyes are black as night, so black they're almost blue, 
And her foot is just the size to fit a 
number seven shoe. 
CHORUS. 
For she's as gentle as a 
turtle dove, 
And her name is Araminta Susan Brown, 
She dresses like a 
belle and she loves this darkey well, 
She's the nobbiest gal that promenades the town. 
I 
pay for all her clothes, and she has 'ern made in style, 
She never drinks a 
drop, but often takes a 
smile, 
She dances like a 
sylph, and looks so gay and neat. 
As she shakes a 
jig to pieces, with her number seven feet. 
For she's, etc. 
I 
asked the other day if she would marry me, 
She said she couldn't tell me then, but if I'd wait she'd see, 
I

But she said she'd have me if I'd take her number seven shoe.

SLIM AND SLIPPERY SOUTH f4a1N 
SONG AND DANCE. 
Or all the lively colored folks, 
That's in this country round, 
There's no one half so handy 
As this nigger you be bound. 
I 
dance from dark till daylight, 
And my cognomen is Sam— 
This Slim and Slippery Southern Nig, 
From Sunny Alabam. 
CHORUS. 
See me dance and slide about, 
I 
turn myself near wrong side out, 
I 
hope that you are satisfied, 
For Du the ladies' man, 
This Slim and Slippery Southern Nig, 
From Sunny Alabam. 
Singing is my chief delight, 
Of dancing I 
never tire, 
The way I 
throw myself around 
You'll say I'm hung on wire, 
I'm my mother's only joy, 
My father's name was Ham, 
So watch the antic tricks 
Of this Nig from Alabara. 
See me dance, etc. 
OLD FOLKS AT HOME. 
Way down upon the Swanee ribber, 
Far, far away, 
Dare's wha my heart is turning ebber, 
Dere's wha de old folks stay. 
All up and down de whole creation, 
Sadly I 
roam; 
Still longing for de old plantation. 
And for de old folks at home. 
CHORUS. 
All de world am sad and dreary, 
Ebry where I 
roam; 
Oh I 
darkeys, how my heart grows wea'7, 
Far from de old folks at home. 
All around de little farm I 
wandered, 
When I 
was young; 
Den many happy days I 
squandered, 
Many de songs I 
sung. 
When I 
was playing wid my brudder, 
Happy was I; 
Oh take me to my kind old mudder, 
Dere let me live and die. 
All de world, eze. 
One little hut among de bushes, 
One dat I 
love; 
Still sadly to my memory rushes, 
No matter where I 
rove. 
When will I 
see de bees a 
humming, 
All round de comb ? 
When will I 
hear de banjo tumming, 
Down in my good home. 
All de world, &a.

I 
met a 
maiden fair to see, 
At Landmann's, where we 'd 
shrimps and tea, 
And as she pull'd the prawns in two, 
She discolated me, a 
few; 
The avenue cars had ceas'd to run, 
The lager and the tea were done, 
So I 
proposed to seek the Park, 
And walk there until dark.-Ah I 
Spoken.-She said she would; and we were about to set out, 
when I 
looked at her feet, and, 0 
horrors I 
found her shoemaker 
had forgotten fashionable heels, so I 
gently remarked-Cnoaus

And through the ladies whispers ran,

My friend came up, and said, " I

There was no wheelosipeae, and it was mining buckets; so, con

At last, grown tired of single life, 
I 
took unto myself a

And called her darling, pet, and dove; 
But vain the bliss that I 
had hop'd, 
One evening off she slop'd.-Ah I

Words by Wm. H. 
DELRHANTY. 
Music by T. BRIGHAM BISHOP. 
Now I'm going to tell you all a 
little story, 
But I 
promise you l'll not detain you long; 
It's about a 
darling, charming, little sweet one, 
She's the captivating subject. of my song. 
But I'll tell you how we talked and how we flirted, 
When I 
met this belle: 
And ' twas then I 
called her little Dew D'Andies, 
For her name she would not tell. 
CHORUS. 
She's so sweet 
and so neat 
Oh I 
love the charming little Dew D'Andies, 
She's the sweetest girl that ever you did see, 
And she often sings me love among the roses. 
Now boys, she's just the girl for me. 
When I 
met her first 'twas out upon a 
pic-nic, 
And I 
shall never forget her winning smile, 
For she danced and made the changes in the music, 
With her graceful pretty fascinating smile. 
Then I 
asked her for her name and her directions, 
For I'd like to call, 
Then she turned around and whispered Dew D'Andies, 
And she smiling said 'twas all. 
She's so sweet, (to. 
So, now listen to the sequel of my story, 
For as time rolled on we dearer friends became; 
And though yet I 
call her little Dew D'Andies, 
I 
am sure she's got .another pretty name. 
I 
have placed a 
ring upon her taper finger, 
So we're one, life for life; 
And Rosy May my little Dew D'Andies, 
Is my darling, charming wife. 
She's so sweet, eto.

And when Massa Hembold came, 
He paid us for the same.

Picking up the Buchu;

Day time, night time, always full of fun, 
In our cozy little cots, 
Us happy Hottentots. 
Sing and dance most all the day, 
Singing, dancing, pass the time away, 
All our troubles come and go, 
We send them down below.

MY LOVE SHE IS A COOK. 
I 
wonder where my Susie is ? 
She said she would meet me here; 
It's been a 
half an hour or more, 
And still she don't appear. 
There's something must the matter be, 
Or she would not stay away; 
have not seen her loving face, 
A week ago to day. 
C ORM.

cook, 
She has such winning ways; 
And a 
fascinating look.

yes, I 
love my Susie dear, 
Although she's but a 
cook; 
For she has such winning ways, 
And a 
fascinating look. 
0, iimmy, you'll excuse me, 
I 
could not come last night: 
My sister's cat was very sick, 
And the dog had got the gripes. 
But don't forget to- morrow, 
About the hour of halipast two; 
And I'll be in the kitchen, love, 
Awaiting there for you. 
ORUS. 
My Susie she is handsome, 
She is upon my word ; 
She dances like a 
fairy, 
And sings just like a 
bird. 
My Susie says she loves me, 
And I 
know she loves me too; 
And if she would prove false to me, 
It would break my heart in two.

FASHIONABLE FRED. 
Of me you may have read, I'm Fashionable Fred, 
And no matter where I

I'm looked on as the cheese, and all the girls I 
please, 
I'm a 
model swell of elegance and grace. 
Wire in and go a-head, then 'or Fashionable Fred I 
Pit-pat's the way, and shart, about the word; 
Give me sufficient cash, then see me cut a

For, whatever's slow

Yes, Pm just about the - 1st for Broadway, 
To keep the proper pace. I

Wire in and go a-head, then, for Fashionable Fred 
I'm Fashionable Fred, the ladies' man. 
My 
life, from first to last, has beet jolly, gay and fast, 
In fact, to find a 
faster, you'd be teased. 
In everything I'm quick, the Yankees call it " slick," 
I'm something like a 
flash of lightning greased. 
Yet, in any running ground, I'm game, you may be bound, 
To give a 
flash of lightning ten yards start, 
I'd run for twenty pounds, and, ere we'd been twice xotnad, 
I'd pass it like a 
bullet or a 
dart. 
For I'm just about, &c. 
This is the age for dash, and all must come out flash, 
If in this world they try to make their way. 
If you wear a 
seedy dress, you'll find to your distress, 
All your friends will quickly turn their heads away. 
Though I'm not worth a 
groat, I 
wear a 
decent coat, 
And rattle on, and keep on going a-head; 
And all the world you see, will fraternize with me, 
And soon pall in with Fashionable Fred. 
For, I'm just about, &c. 
Though in the Park I 
walk, and with the ladies talk, 
My tailors' bills I 
always like to run; 
I 
canter in the Avenue, and when to balls I 
go: 
I 
gallop with the charming girls, like fun. 
With the times I 
keep a 
pace, and with them run a 
race, 
Still of them I 
am always found a-head; 
I'm ready for a 
lark, no matter light or dark, 
Up to any game is Fashionable Fred. 
For, I'm just about, &e.

Composed by EDDIE Fox. 
Arranged by II A MARSIMIA, 
As I 
took a 
promenade the other day. 
My attention was attracted right-away 
By a 
pretty little Belle tha.. said her name was .NelL. 
Awl she looked like the flowers in May. 
I 
stepped up to the corner of the street, 
Thinking by that I 
could meet 
This pretty little Fairy, so beautiful and airy, 
With number one gaiters on her feet. 
CHORUS : 
Oh didn t

She's as sweet as the lilies in the dell; 
Her eyes so bright. he ,. 
step so light: 
Is my handsome little curly-headed Nell-
I 
followed her, I 
cannot tell you why 
But she had such a 
wicked-killing eye. 
That Cupid with his dart, made a 
capture of my heart. 
As daintily she sailed on by 
I 
watched her to her home aid, at the door, 
She stopped and smiled on me 
And, from her iitt.e glove sbe threw a 
kiss of love, 
With a 
wicsed hale laugh at me. 
Oh! didn't she, eze. 
Soon after that I 
met her at a 
ball: 
Oh golly 
you should have seen my style, 
WItt. Nettie on my arm oh. she dances like a 
charm, 
While her little heart is innocent of guile. 
I &cid her of my love, that N cry night, 
And said 
Will you be mine ? 
Oh yes 
said littia Neii, but you must never tell, 
And now we live down in shady dell. 
Oh didn't she, Sas 
She hugged me and she kissed me, 
She took me by the hand, 
She said, I 
was the sweetest thing, 
In shape of mortal man. 
I 
told her that I 
loved her! 
My love was good and strong, 
I 
asked her if she'd marry me, 
She told me to go ' long. 
Come and kiss me, 
Come and kiss me,

Don't be mad with me.

Why married we will be I 
Come and, kiss me,

Come and kiss me, Susie, 
Don't be mad with me.

I 
hear the young ones cry.

Well, I'll give him a 
trial, and if he don't mind, 
As I 
such a 
Tartar he never could find; 
I'll give him soft words, and love's sweetest smile, 
And try, with love's arts, all his hours to beguile ; 
And then should another e'en dare to intrude, 
Round his ears such a 
tempest will gather so rude, 
He'll declare since the world by a 
deluge was drowned, 
Like Suzette not another on earth could be found. 
And if I 
should take him and make him my own, 
And wed this gay Willie, the pride of the town, 
No longer should I 
play so jealous a 
part, 
For then I 
should have, as he tells me, his heart ; 
I'd be a 
good helpmate, and dwell by his side, 
And the girls who once loved him would envy his bride; 
Then, oh ! I'll be happy all the rest of my life, 
Now Willie's my husband, and Suzette is his wife. 
HOW PEAL ON PEAL THUNDER ROLLS. 
Sung by Mu. SANTLEY, in Balfe's " Puritan's Daughter." 
How peal on peal of thunder 
Rolls crashing through the sky; 
'While, sweeping all before it, 
The wind flits madly by! 
With terror and w:+11 darkness 
Fair Nature lies oppressed, 
But oh, what gloom can equal 
The gloom within my breast. 
Long ere to-morrow dawneth 
The storm without may cease, 
And night, begemmed w:th rain-drop, 
Lie cradled into peace. 
The thunder may be silent, 
The wind be hushed to rest; 
But oh! what power will silence 
The storm within my breast.

APPLE OF MY EYE. 
Words and Music by Wan if. DELEHANTT. 
Oh where, oh where, 
Can all the music be, 
Falling on my ear, 
Floating in the air ? 
Or, are the angels 
Singing love to rue, 
'Bout Miss Susie Dean, 
The apple of my eye. 
Oh Susie, my darling, 
hope I 
never die; 
That you may live forever, 
The apple of my eye; 
'Twas in the orchard, Susie darling, 
When no one else was nigh, 
I 
called you then my star and treasure, 
The apple of my eye. 
It fills my soul 
With joy and ecstacy; 
The memory is so sweet, 
Of when we first did meet 
The sweetest fruit, 
That ripens on a 
tree, 
With Susie can't compete, 
The apple of my eye, 
Oh, Susie, my darling, 
I 
hope I 
never die, 
That you may live forever, 
The apple of my eye; 
'Twas in the orchard, Susie darling, 
When no one else was nigh, 
I 
called you then my star and treasure, 
The apple of my eye,

MOONLIGHT AT CAPE MAY 
Oh I 
my poor heart is not my own, 
It was stolen by a 
charming girl, 
Whose eyes are black and full of love 
And her teeth as white as pearl. 
How we first met fll now tell you: 
'Twas to me such a 
happy day : 
'Twas down on the beach, in the evening, 
In the moonlight at Cape May. 
CHORDS. 
How sweet to me this girl did seem, 
The dear one of my happy dream— 
She's such a 
little beauty, 
Like a 
butterfly light and gay. 
I 
met her on the beach, in the evening, 
In the moonlight at Cape May. 
Oh I 
she was gazing calml. , 
As the waves rolled near her feet; 
She turned her head as I 
came by : 
Then, of course, our eyes did meet. 
We spoke about the sweet moonlight, 
While the hours they passed away-. 
As we walked, .1 
was so happy, 
In the moonlight at Cape May. 
How sweet to me, & 
Next evening as I 
passed the house, 
I 
called my love to see; 
And side by side we rambled on, 
it was hours of bliss to me. 
I 
asked her if she would have me: 
"For I 
love you," I 
did say. 
She promised then to be my wif 
In the moonlight at Cape May. 
How sweet to me, rte.

When my darling said, forever thine. 
Walking not on Broadway, 
Nor in the City Park, 
We wandered, thoughtless, far away from home. 
'Twas out among the forest trees, 
Beside a 
running brook, 
-Wc spoke about the happy days to come. 
CHORUS—Oh, yes. I 
was in ectacy, 
• She was all the world to me, 
She said she loved me more than once, 
Which did my heart inspire, 
4, 
I 
called her Rose, the pink of beaux, 
She's all that I 
desire. 
While in conversation, 
Rosie, with a 
sigh ; 
Asked me if • I 
ever was in love? 
I 
answered, ‘• No, my darling, 
Never until now ; 
1 
vow it, by the little stars above." 
Then, like one awaking, 
From a happy dream ; 
While her cheeks were blushing rosy red, 
"May your love grow stronger-, 
To equal inine for you," 
And that is all my little darling said. 
Oh, yes, eta. 
Holding on the door knob, 
Bidding sweet good night, 
Never fet so happy in my life. 
Happy not at parting, 
But what my darling said, 
When I 
asked her would site be 
" 
Yes, with all my heart, love, 
When I 
am of age ; 
I 
am seventeen to- morrow, you must know, 
Wait a 
little longer, 
Just another year." 
Next Sunday makes it just a 
year. 
my wife, 
Oh, yes, eta. 
MY LITTLE BUNCH OF ROSES 
Words and Music by W. H. D ELEHANTY. 
I 
am waiting nen) to meet my darling, 
And my heart is in a 
flutter of delight; 
For we kissed last night when we were parting, 
And this is where she bid me come to- night. 
When away from her I 
am so lonely, 
I 
know not what to do ; 
But her bright, sweet smile can ever cheer me, 
Her heart is warm and true. 
Oh! 
When we kissed then I 
saw her pretty blushes, 
She turned her face away the blush to bide ; 
I 
was happy with my bunch of roses, 
My little bunch of roses by my side. 
crtonus. 
There is something that I 
must not tell, 
And that is where this maid does dwell. 
In her hair she wears a 
white camelia, 
And darn blue is the color of her eyes; 
And I 
call her my little bunch of roses, 
My darling, charming, captivating prize. 
It was in those happy -days of childhod. 
When first I 
met this roguish little belle ; 
By it streamlet running through the wild wood, 
Though but a 
boy, in love with her I 
fell. 
She is now the pride of all the city, 
Of summers, sweet sixteen; 
4knd is called by all a 
perfect beauty, 
A fawnlike, fairy queen. Oh! 
Now I 
meet her almost every evening, 
And I 
think it is the sweetest thing in life; 
For to walk with the flower of my affection, 
, Especially when she's soon to be my wife.

There is something, & o. 
'Twas an evening when the moon was shining, 
The little stars were twinkling far above; 
Arm- in-arm we were walking in the garden,

So I 
asked her then if she would take me, 
For better or for worse ; 
When she smiled on me so very sweetly 
And answered. 
Yes, of course; Oh !"

The first time that I 
met my love, ' twas going down Broadway, 
With all her fancy fixings on, she looked so neat and gay, 
When dandy barber Jim passed by, you'd ought to hear her laugh ; 
I 
would have given five dollars then to have her photograph. 
Anne Eliza, etc. 
I'll marry Anne Eliza Jane, and settle down in life, 
I 
know I 
will contented be, with such a 
pretty wife, 
On our wedding night the bones and tambo we shall ring. 
And the fiddle join the chorus, while the darks all gayly sing.

Lovely and fair is my darling Patchoula, 
With eyes tender blue as the mid summer's sky 
She is my jewel, my heart's fondest treasure, 
The bloom on her cheek will the roses out-vie. 
She treats coldly my passionate ardor, 
Oh its then that I

She stood by the side of her own father's gate— 
The smile that she gave me, had the spell of a

'Twits then that I

With her manners so bewitching and simple, 
Her cheeks are so roguish and dimpled ;

When the moon is shining brightest, 
And the zephyrs softly blow; 
When the- waves are beating lightest. 
Up the Avenue I

And at the Parson's gate I

Pretty little Dewdrop Brown.

The loveliest girl in town. 
Ho I

The loveliest girl up town,

Thou'rt always standing at the rate, 
By the cottage on the hill ; 
To greet me with a 
happy smile, 
Thy soldier lover will. 
Oh ! amid the heat of battle, 
When the shells were bursting round. 
Did I 
hear thy merry prattle, 
My dear little Dewdrop Brown. 
Ho ! my little, d7e., 
Oh ! thine eyes they are the brightest 
And thy voice so full of mirth, 
That me thinks thou art a

LOVE AMONG THE ROSES. 
SONO AND DANCE. 
Words by W. EL Dzysneyrv. 
music by E. N. 
OILTLINe 
It was on one Summer's evening, 
In the merry month of June; 
I 
beheld a 
damsel sitting 
'Mid flowers' sweet perfume. 
She had a 
novel, reading, 
Just as I 
was passing by, 
And as she turned another page, 
I 
saw the brightest eye ; 
A bewitching smile was on her face. 
As charming as the posies: 
I 
felt the smart of Cupid's dart: 
'Twas love among the roses. 
CHORUS.— Now, I 
hate to tell, but then I 
mnst; 
Within her heart I 
place my trust; 
She was sitting in the garden, 
Where the little butterfly reposes: 
And how we met, I'll ne'er forget, 
'Twas love among the roses. 
I 
passed her house next evening, 
The clock had just struck eight, 
And I 
saw my future happiness; 
She was standing by the garden-gate. 
She smiled as I 
approached her, 
And I 
begged her to excuse; 
May I 
view those pretty flowers ? 
She murmured: If you choose. 
I 
spoke about the violets, 
Then finally made proposes; 
Thro' the garden we walked, of happiness talked 
'Twas love among the roses. 
Now, I 
hate to tell, & a. 
I 
confess I 
love Matilda; 
Matilda, that's her name; 
And there is a 
charm about her, 
Which I 
never can explain. 
She dresses up to fashion, 
To her style there is no end, 
And, of course, she must look dashing; 
For, she wears a 
Grecian Bend. 
But she's left her home, and where she's gone, 
Most every one supposes; 
For, as dear as life is my little wife: 
'Twat; love among the roses. 
Now, I 
hate to tell, cfro.

In an ivy-covered cottage, 
Hidden back ot oaken trQes, 
Lives a 
lovely little maiden, 
Blythe and happy as you please. 
Where upon a 
low verandah, 
Every summer's eventide, 
I 
sit amid the flowers fair 
Camillia by my side. 
CHORUS. 
All among the roses, 
Making sweet proposes— 
Lovely, laughing, soul bewitching, 
Sweet Camillia May ; 
Captivating, aggravating, 
Never tired of play— 
Fatting like a 
little birdie, 
Happy, light and gay ; 
Kill me or P11 (lie with love 
For sweet, Catnillia May. 
There's a 
pretty white camelia; 
Ever glowing in her hair, 
Lovely violets and roses 
Blooming in her face so fair; 
Little stars and merry sunshine 
In her eye so bright and gay, 
And a 
choir of angels singing 
in the voice of Milly May.

When in love you chance to be, 
Try and keep in all your feelings 
Not, act foolishly like me; 
For I

Of a 
coming joyolts day, 
When I'll make of one Otanillia 
Such a 
lovely sweet bouquet.

THE HAPPIEST DARKIES OUT. 
We've just arrived in town to-night, 
Our story for to tell, 
We don't care much if we ain't white, 
Our color suits us well ; 
We practice on the heel and toe, 
And then we sing and shout, 
We're always welcome where we go, 
We're the happiest darkies out. 
CHORUS. 
Just watch the movements of the shin 
We kick dull care about, 
And always wear ajolly grin, 
The happiest darkies out. 
When our plantation work is done, 
We go upon a 
spree. 
To have a 
little sport and fun, 
Our hearts chock full of glee; 
Let politicians lave and blow, 
Let everybody shout. 
We care for neither friend nor foe, 
We're the happiest darkies out. 
Just watch, Sce. 
We both support double-breasted heels, 
Which brings us lots of cash, 
We both love ' utters and fried eels, 
And don't go back on hash; 
And thus we pass each night and day, 
Take dull care by the snout, 
And make him scoot some other way, 
From the happiest darkies out. 
Just watch, &e. 
.We go to a 
fancy colored ball, 
And dance a 
jig or reel, 
We fascinate the wenches all, 
By the movement of the heel. 
They think we are aristocrats 
From Fifth Avenue no doubt— 
"But no," we cry, ' that's all my eye," 
We're the happiest darkies out. 
Just watch, (tic.

She was driving in a

With the ribbons in her hand;

Was the fairest in the land. 
Her hair done up in a

And blushingly she said,

And wedded we were soon; 
But soon I found out her defects 
-While spending honeymoon. 
She was a

Besides her hair that would come off, 
She had a 
patent eye; 
Her teeth came out, I 
grieve to say, 
For loudly did I 
cry 
To see her limbs come one by one 
From off her graceful form; 
I'd only married half a

But her money keeps me warm. 
She was a 
spark, the brightest spark 
That ever you did see; 
She was not the belle I 
thought she was, 
But her money it just suits me.

Oh, yes ! I'm dancing mad,

Oh, yes1 I'm dancing mad. 
We married were, things went all right, 
Forget I

When coining home one night to her, 
In my house was some young num. 
Who was entertained at my expense, 
And they both seem'd very glad, 
When they turu'd them round and saw me there 
T

With blacken'd both my eyes;

There was Nancy Fat and Susie Brown and Annie Maria

And as they gazed upon us, my coat away they stole.

The Ham Fat man he's smothered to death with dancing

When the ball was out they all came down the street,
