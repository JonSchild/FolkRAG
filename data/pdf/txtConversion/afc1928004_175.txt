LINES. 
Dedicated to JUIN M. BURKE, Comedian, and recited by him. 
By EDW. STEWART LLOYD 
I 
long to gaze on the towering hills. 
On the castles ruined, yet grand. 
To roam once more o'er the meadows and fields, 
Of my fathers' native land ; 
To gaze once more at that storied Isle, 
'Where the great have lived and died, 
Where Genius, Valor, Art and Truth, 
Have reigned in stateliest pride. 
I 
long to grasp the toil- worn hands, 
Of patriots true as steel, 
And I 
long to meet those tyrant bands, 
Who would make the brave Celt kneel. 
I 
long to bow o'er the sacred sod, 
Above Erin's martyred pride, 
To bless the heroes sleeping there, 
And the cause for which they died. 
And I 
love the red-checked maids who dwell 
Beneath the sunny skies— 
But better than all, I 
long to see 
Ten thousand heroes rise, 
And 'neath that fading Flag of Green, 
To which we proudly bend the knee, 
To strike one blow at the Saxon foe, 
Which would make poor grin free. 
And g 
ateful hearts are beating now, 
With hope to see that day— 
Beating in this western land, 
Three thousand miles away. 
Scranton, Pa., Sunday, Nov. 14, 1868.

THE BASHFUL LOVER. 
Sung with great applause, with the Mirror of Ireland by Miss A.NNIE 
F. Imam 
I 
know a 
very charming youth, 
As far as looks will go, 
And if I 
told you all the truth, 
His name l'm sure you know. 
He pays a 
visit twice a 
week, 
His manners are absurd ; 
He looks as if he'd like to speak, 
But never says a 
word. 
CHORUS. 
I never saw, in all my life 
A lover so absurd ; 
Although I 
know he wants a 
wife, 
lie never says a 
word. 
Now, when he calls, he takes a 
chair, 
And slyly looks around ; 
He runs his fingers through his hair, 
Then gazes on the ground. 
And very oft' he gives a 
sigh, 
The saddest ever heard, 
He makes me mad enough to cry_ 
He never says a 
word. 
I 
never saw, itc. 
His eyes are bright and eloquent, 
I 
wish his tongue was, too; 
And when upon me they are bent, 
They pierce me through and throng!). 
I 
try to put him at his ease, 
I'm cheerful as a 
bird , 
He makes me mad enough to cry, 
He never says a 
word. 
I 
never saw, dze. 
What a 
husband he would make, 
How still would be the house, 
His gentle voice would never break 
The slumbers of a 
mouse. 
I 
never saw in all my life 
A 
lover so absurd, 
Although I 
know he wants a 
wife, 
He never says a 
word. 
I 
never saw, d:c. 
BOWLD SOTER BOY. 
Oh, there's not a 
trade that's going, worth showing or knowing, 
Like that from glory growing, for a 
Bowld Sojer Boy; 
Where right or left we go, sure you know, friend or foe, 
'Will have the hand or toe from the Bowld Sojer Boy. 
There's not a 
town we march thro', but ladies looking arch 
thro', 
The window panes will search thro', the ranks to find their 
joy. 
While up the street, each girl you meet with look so sly, will 
cry ' My 
eye, 
Oh, isn't he a 
darling the Bowld Sojer Boy I' 
But when we get the rout, how they pout and they shout, 
While to the right about goes the Bowld Sojer Boy. 
'Tis then the ladies fair, in despair, tear their hair, 
But the devil a 
one I 
care, says the Bowld Sojer Boy, 
For the world is rtll before us, where the landladies adore us, 
And ne'er refits, to score us, but chalk us up with joy. 
We taste her tap, we tear her cap, ' Oh, that's the chap for me, 
says she, 
' 
Oh, isn't he a 
darling, the Bowld Soler Boy.' 
Then come along with me, Gramachree, and you'll see, 
How happy you will be with your Bowld Sojer Boy. 
Faith if you're up to fun, with me run, 'twill be done 
In the snapping of a 
gun, says the Bowld Sojer Boy. 
And ' tis then that without scandal, myself would proudly 
dandle, 
The little farthing candle, of our mutual love and joy. 
May his light shine as bright as mine, till in the line he'll 
blaze, and raise 
The glory of his corps, like a 
Bowld Sojer Boy.

THE DUBLIN DANCIN' 
MASTER. 
As 
sung by J. 
M. BURKE. 
AIR.—" Limerick Races." 
in Dublin city once there lived, 
A 
craythur gay an' hearty, oh 
A dancin' master he by thrade, 
His name was Teddy M'Carthy oh ! 
He taught the girls and boys to dance, 
And none could do so faster— 
He always danced so nate and nice; 
Did this Dublin Dancin' master. 
CHORUS. 
With his down the middle ! hands across. 
Go a

pupil. 
Och, how do you do, sir, you,re a 
pupil I've had in my 
eye for many a 
day, and I 
assure you sir, you could not put 
yourself in betther hands for the practice of your feet. 
This is 
sonnethin in your style o' dancin' I 
presume sir '? ( Dances a 
Spanish waltz.) Now, Sir, just thry that. ( Imitates an awkward 
pupil.) 
AIL sir, I'm afeard you'll nivir make a 
dancer ; 
legs are not fellows ; however, I'll see if I 
can't cure you in 
Now Teddy taught both reels and jigs, 
And all the other dances, 
From Highland fling to plain quadrille, 
To please the ladies' fancies.

Thus Teddy got the boys and girls 
Proficient in their dances— 
Polkas, jigs and schottisches,

No matter what the dance he taught, 
None could go it faster, 
And none could dance an Irish jig, 
Like the Dublin dancin' masther.

I

Vow. attention I

And perhaps it'll cause you to smile. 
I'm jolly and gay, the truth I 
say— 
And the girls both near and far, 
Says it's quite a 
thrate to take a 
sate, 
sliad a 
drive on my jaunting car. 
CHORUS. 
Driving, joulting, driving on a

For when I 
get a

As I 
sit on my jaunting car; 
The reins I

And off goes my jaunting car. 
In Dublin town, of great renown, 
You'll find me on the stand; 
On my car so nate, just take a

And I'll drive through the streets so grand, 
The sights so fine, all others outshine, 
No matter near or far, 
The reins I'll grip, and crack my whip 
ud oft' flies my jaunting car. 
Driving, joulting, &c. 
If a 
girl to your mind you wish to fina 
Ould Ireland's just the part; 
The colleens fair, I 
do declare,' 
Are sure to steal your heart. 
With a 
glance so 61y and beaming eye, 
As bright as any star, 
By the powers of Jove, you're sure to fall in love 
If you drive in the jaunting car. 
Driving, joulting, 
So if you wish for sport, sure I'm the sort 
Can find you lots of fun ; 
I 
can sit on my yoke and crack a 
joke, 
With any boy under the sun. 
I 
know well enough where they sell good stuff, 
And the girls behind the bar, 
Can tell by my wink, what sort of drink 
Can grease the wheels of my jaunting car. 
SPOKE.— Car, your honor; here you are, sir; the first car on the 
stand. You want a 
Hansom; oh, well, as you are not over handsome, 
your honor, may be you'd look better in a 
hansom than sitting on an 
outside car. 
Are you going out, ma'am ? 
This way for Irishtown 
and Sandymount. Long life to you. Captain, don't forget your own 
boy, sir; look at the animal—the real quality blood that's in him; sure 
his own mother won the zooid cup at the Curragh. 
Get up, sir, and 
I'll drive von out of your mind; and if you're a 
teetotaller, you need 
not 1)3 dry; for T 
have a 
well in my car, and some beautiful springs fin 
derneath; all I'll ask is my fare, leaving any other little trifle to your.

THE HARP 
THAT ONCE THRO 1 TARA'S HALLS. 
The harp that once thro' Tara's halls 
The soul of music shed, 
Now hangs as mute on Tara's walls 
As if that soul had fled. 
So sleeps the pride of former days, 
So glory's thrill is o'er, 
And hearts that once beat high for praise, 
Now feel that pulse no more. 
No more to chiefs and ladies bright 
The harp of Tara swells; 
The chord alone, that breaks at night, 
Its tale of ruin tells. 
Thus freedom now seldom wakes; 
The only throb it gives 
Is when some heart indignant breaits 
To show that she still lives.

GROVES OF BLARNEY. 
:—" The Last Rose of Summer." 
The groves of Blarney they are so charming, 
All by the purling of swate silent brooks, 
All decked with roses which spontaneous grow there, 
Planted in order by the swate rocky nooks. 
'Tis there the daisy and swath carnation, 
The blooming pink and the rose so fair, 
Besides the lilly, and the daffy-down- dilly 
Flowers that scent the swate fragrant air. 
'Tis Lady Jeffers that owns this station, 
Like Alexander, or Queen lIelqn fair ; 
There's no commander throughout this natiOrt 
For emulation can with her compare. 
There's castles round her that no nine-pounder 
Could dare to plunder her place of strength; 
But Oliver en-minterl he did her pummell, 
And made a 
breach in her battlement. 
There's grand walks there for contemplation, 
And conversation in swath solitude: 
'Tis there the lover may hear the dove, or 
The gentle plover in the afternoon 
And if a 
young lady should be so engaging, 
As for to take a 
walk in their shady bowers, 
'Tis there her courter, he might transport her 
To some dark fort or under ground. 
'Tis there's the cave where no daylight enters, 
But bats, rats, and badgers are forever bred, 
All decked by natur' which makes it swater 
Nor a 
coach and six or a 
feather bed. 
'Tis there's the lakes that are stored with perches, 
And comely eels in the verdant mud, 
Besides the leeches, and the groves of beeches 
All standing in order to guard the flood. 
There is the stone that whoever kisses, 
lie never misses to grow eloquent— 
'Tis he may clamber to a 
lady's chamber, 
Or become a 
member of Parliament. 
A clever spouter, he'll sure turn out, or 
" 
An out-and-outer" to be let alone; 
Don't hope to hinder him, or to bewilder him— 
Sure he's a 
Pilgrim from the Blarney Stone. 
'Tis there's the kitchen, hangs many a 
flitch in, 
With the maids a-stitching upon the stair; 
Och the bread and the biskie% the beef and the whisky. 
Faith 
they'd make you frisky if you was but there. 
'Tis there you'd see Peg Murphy's daughter, 
A washing pratis foment the door, 
With Nancy Casey, and Aunt Delaney, 
All blood relations, to my Lord Donoughmore. 
There's statues gracing this noble place in, 
All heathen goddesses so fair; 
Bola Neptune, Plutarch, and Nicodemus, 
All mother-naked in the open air. 
So now to finish this brave narration, 
Which I 
have not the genii for to entwine, 
But were I 
Homer or Nebuchadneezar, 
'Tis in every feature that I'd make it shine.

HAVE YOU EVER BEEN HARD UP, MY JEWEL. 
Have you ever been hard up, my jewel, 
Without e'er a 
coin on the road, 
No prospect of food or of fuel, 
Your own weight a 
terrible load. 
Have you ever begged two-pence of some One 
To close your two peepers in sleep, 
Or counted the stars till the morning, 
Or heard the first Ba-a of the sheep. 
Have you ever devoured a 
turnip, 
Or relished a 
handful of wheat, 
And then spied a 
sturdy old farmer 
Who soon made you take to your feet. 
Then has not the thought of dear Ireland 
Brought brine to your weary old eye, 
And has not the sweet Bay of Dublin, 
In dreams rolled majestically by. 
THE DEAR LITTLE MAID IN' BRISTOL _ARCADE 
The dear little maid in the Bristol Arcade, 
I 
met on a 
sweet summer morning; 
Her bright eyes of blue they burst on my vew. 
Like the sun when the east he's adorning. 
I 
wish in my heart I 
could see her again, 
I'd ask her to make me the happiest of men : 
The clear little maid of the Bristol Arcade, 
I 
met on a 
sweet summer morning. 
Mfg.
Oh, if I 
had thousands they all should be hers, 
And if I'd a 
throne she should share it; 
A 
crown I 
with pleasure to her would present, 
And proud be to witness her wear it. 
I 
hope that I 
soon shall behold her again, 
And find she will make me the happiest of men. 
The dear little maid of the Bristol Arcade, 
I 
met on a 
sweet summer morning.

KILLARNEY.—LCONCLUDED.1 
Innisfallen's ruined shrine 
May suggest a 
passing sigh; 
But man's faith can ne'er decline, 
Such God's wonders floating by. 
Castle Lough and Glena Bay, 
Mountains Tore and Eagles' Nest, 
Still at Mucross you must pray, 
Though the monks are now at rest. 
Angels wonder not that man 
There would fain prolong life's span : 
Beauty's home, Killarney, 
Ever fair Killarney. 
No place else can charm the eye 
With such bright and varied tints, 
Every rock that you pass by, 
Verdure broiders or bespriuts ; 
Virgin there the green grass grows, 
Every morn spring's natal day, 
Bright-hued berries doff the snows, 
Smiling winter's frown away. 
Angels often pausing there, 
Doubt if Eden were more fair; 
Beauty's home, Killarney 
Ever fair Killarney. 
Music there for echo dwells, 
Makes each sound a 
harmony, 
Many-voiced the chorus swells, 
Till it faints in ecstasy. 
With the eharmful tints below 
Seems the heaven above to vie, 
All rich colors that we know, 
Tinge the cloud-wreaths in that sky. 
Wings of angels so might shine, 
Glancing back soft light divine ; 
Beauty's home, Killarney, 
Ever fair Killarney.

AN IRISH BOY, 
FROM DUBLIN TOWN I 
CAME. 
0J.IGHO.LLY SUNG IN AMERICA BY J-. 
If. BUMF 
Am.—" Round Goes the World." 
Ah, shure my darlings, ye'd like to know, 
The country from whence I 
came, 
And who and what I 
really am, 
And ye'd like to know my name. 
tell you in a 
trice, boys, 
Tho' you can see it in a 
smile, 
I'm a 
son of what they call, faith, 
A son of Erin's isle. 
I 
am an Irish boy, 
From Dublin town I 
cann, 
I 
drive an Irish jaunting car, 
Pat Murphy is my name. 
I've got a 
fine mud cabin, 
A 
calf, a 
pig, a 
cow, 
And a 
fine great shillelah, 
To protect me in a 
row. 
And what is more, my darlinj, 
lye a 
good old jaunting car, 
And for the boys that visit me, 
There's whiskey in the jar. 
Ould Ireland is the place, 
For frolic, fun, and mirth, 
Its equal you can't find, 
If you search through all the er.fth. 
And who like Irish lads, 
Can twist and twirl the twig, 
Besides, show me who like them, 
Can dance an Irish jig. 
Now should you visit Ireland, 
Don't forget to call 
On Paddy Murphy, and when there, 
he'll be glad to treat ye all,. 
And drink a 
toast in whiskey, 
In true good Irish style, 
Here's success to Dan OCennelL 
And the sons of Erin's Isle

Oh ! boys l'm not long from the army, 
I

I 
was always the devil for fightin', 
When I 
had any fig:lain' to do. 
I 
enlisted one day for a 
soger, 
They gev me a

Hurrah ! boys, let's all be merry and free— 
Hurrah ! boys, a

Hurrah ! boys, a

And I

Whin I'll fight for the green Irish sod. 
'Tis then I'll forget all contintion, 
Excipt where there's need to con/id; 
In the ranks of the brave I'll stand foremost, 
My own native land to defend.

Whether on the scaffold high, 
Or in the battle's van—

'Tis myself that bears an illigant name, 
And who dare say 'tis not ?

In a

That I 
bear such an illigant name.

And my mother's a

There's the English. the Irish, the Scotch, and the Welch, 
And success to them all jolly four; 
And bad luck to me if one of them will flinch, 
If there was but one to a

For John Bull's cold steel will make them freeze; 
Paddy's shillaleh will warm them enough; 
Taffy will choke them with red-hot toasted cheese; 
And Scotchey will blind them with snuff.

And with determination went in every man, 
When they blew up the Cashmere gate. 
The word of command 14-orn our generals did fly, 
And lion-hearted fought officers and men, 
Blood for blood, was our country's cry, 
And we'll never trust the Indians again.

THE LADS WHO LIVE IN IRELAND: 
THE IRISH STRANGER. 
Oh, pity the fate of a 
poor Trish str anger, 
That's wandered thus far from his home ; 
I 
sigh for protection from want, woe and danger, 
But know not which way to roam. 
I 
ne'er shall return to Hibernia's bowers, 
For bigotry bath trampled her sweetest of flowers, 
That gave comfort to me in my loneliest hours, 
They are gone and 
ne'er see them more. 
With wonder I 
gazed on -von lofty building, 
As in grandeur it rose for its lord ; 
With sorrow I 
beheld my own garden soon yielding, 
Its choicest of fruits for its board : 
But where is my father's low cottage of clay, 
Wherein I 
dia spend many a 
lon•g, happy day, 
Alas! has his lordship removed it away 
Yes, it has gone, and I'll ne'er see it more. 
When nature was seen on the sloe-bush and bramble, 
Sit smiling in beautiful bloom— 
O'er field without danger I 
used to ramble, 
And lavish amidst her perfume; 
Or range thro' the woods where the gay feather'd thikrug, 
Did joyfully sing their loud-echoing ; 
The days, then, of summer passed sweetly along, 
I 
Now they are gone, and ' ll ne'er see them more. 
When the sloes and the berries hung ripe on the bushes, 
I've gathered them off without harm ; 
And gone to the fields where I've shorn the green 
Preparing for winter's cold storm, 
Or I've sat by the fire on a 
cold winter's night, 
Along with my friends telling tales of delight, 
Those tales gave me pleasure, I 
could them invite, 
Now they are gone, shall I 
ne'er see them more 1 
But Erin, sad Erin. it grieves me to ponder, 
On the wrongs of thy injured Isle; 
Thy sons, many thousands deploring to wander, 
on shores off far away in exile. 
But 
give me the power to cross o'er the main, 
America might yield me some shelter from pain, 
I'm only lamenting whilst here I 
remain, 
For the joys that I'll never see more. 
Farewell then, Thin. and those I 
left weeping 
Upon her disconsolate shore 
Farewell to the grave where my father lies sleeping. 
That rround I 
still dearly adore, 
Farewell to each pleasure I 
one" had at home, 
Farewell, now a 
stranger in England I 
roam, 
0 
give my past joys, or give me a 
tomb; 
Yes, in pity I 
ask for no more.

And as to my character, why, I 
can plainly show: 
I'm a 
rantin' rovin' blade, and I 
never was afraid; 
For, I 
was born in Ireland, ctc. 
May Heaven still protect our hospitable Country. 
Where first I 
drew my living breath, and heard its cocks to crow 
Adieu to its green hills and its lovely bay of Bantry I 
Where many a 
pleasant evening, my love and I 
did go. 
Where shoals of fish, so pleasantly, did sport about so merrily, 
Beneath its glassy surface, their wanton tricks to show. 
Oh! those scenes I 
did enjoy, like a 
gay, unthinking boy, 
With the lads who live in Ireland, dkc. 
St. Patrick was our Saint, and a 
blessed man in truth, was he; 
Great gifts unto our Country he freely did bestow; 
lie banished all the frogs and toads that sheltered in our Country 
And unto other regions it's they were forced to go : 
There is one fact undoubtedly, that cannot contradicted be: 
For, trace the Irish history, and it will plainly show ; 
Search the universe all round, tighter fellows can't be found.

THE LIFE OF A SOLDIER. 
Ant—",Tramp, Tramp." 
My name is Paddy Doyle. 
I'm a 
native of the soil 
Where the purty little shamrock, lively, grows: 
For a 
soldier I 
did list, 
Got the bounty in my fist, 
A 
bounty and the nobby suit of clothes. 
CHORUS. 
Tramp, tramp, tramp, the boys are marching, 
Cheer up, comrades, let's be gay; 
We will toast each blooming lass, in afull and flowing glass, 
With the merry fife and drum we'll march away. 
Every pretty girl I 
mark. 
And sometimes I 
have a 
lark, 
I 
praise their figure and their beauty; 
While Cie children run and play, 
We pass the time away, 
Oh I

call doing soger's duty.

THE MACS AND THE O'S. 
When Ireland was founded by the Macs and the O's, 
I 
never could learn, for nobody knows; 
But history says they came over from Spain, 
To visit old Granna, and there to remain; 
Our fathers were heroes for wisdom and fame; 
For multiplication they practiced the same; 
St Patrick came over to heal their complaints, 
And very soon made them an island of saints. 
The harp and the shamrock were carried before 
Brave Roderick O'Connor and Roger O'Moore, 
And the good and bad deeds of the Macs and the O's, 
And this is the tale that these verses disclose. 
Hugh Neil of Tyrone, O'Donnel, °Moore, 
O'Brien, O'Kelly, O'Connell galore, 
All houses so royal, so loyal and old, 
One drop of their blood was worth ounces of gold. 
McDonnell, McDougal, O'Curran, O'Keefe, 
Sly Redmond O'llanlon, the Rapderrey chief; 
O'Mal ey, McNally, O'Sullivan rare, 
°Talley, O'Daily, O'Burns of Kildare; 
O'Dougherty, chief of the Isle Inishone, 
McGinness, the prince of the valleys of Dowr , 
The Collerans, Hollerans, every one knows; 
The Rafferty's, Flahertys—they were all O's.

Some pickles or cucumbers green, 
Or a 
nice little dainty pig's head, 
'Tis the loveliest tit-bit e'er seen, 
Then meet me Miss Molly Malone. 
Then meet me Miss Molly Malone. 
Pastry may do for the gay,

That agrees a

Then come if my dear life you peize; 
I'd have liv'd the last fortnight on air, 
But you sent me two nice mutton pies. 
Then meet me, Miss Molly Malone,

THE SOLDIER OF ERIN. 
AIR:—" Exile of Erin." 
The shadows of darkness around him were falling, 
And eve's lonely star lit the wanderer's way, 
When the .arp of the minstrel, his footsteps recalling, 
The brave soldier paused at the heart- moving lay. 
Oh ! dear to my soul in the spring-time of feeling, 
Ere the blight of the cold world had swept o'er its flowers; 
Was that strain of my childhood from tender lips stealing. 
In fair Connamara's now desolate bow'rs. 
Sweet song of my boyhood, still deeper and deeper, 
it sinks on my heart as I 
list to the strain; 
Like a 
dream of the dead that steals o'er the sleeper, 
And brings back the lost and the loved ones again. 
Dear voice of the past, like the lone harp of Tara 
It wakes 'mid the ruins of all I 
deplore ; 
Farewell to thy green hills, my fair Connemara, 
First home of my heart, I 
shall see thee no more. 
OLD IRELAND MUST BE FREE, BOYS. 
As sung by J. M. BURKE. 
Am—" Always Gay and Free, Boys." 
While time is stealing o'er us, friends, we ought to bear in mind, 
Our dear and lovely Erin, lend we left behind ; 
We'll fill the goblets to the brim, and this our toast shall be, 
Death to every traitor, and old Ireland must be free. 
CHORUS. 
Old Ireland must be free, boys, 
Old Ireland shall be free, boys, 
The home you soon will see, boys, 
When Ireland will be free. 
What has poor Paddy done, that he in fetters should be bound, 
You'll find not braver men, search the Universe all around ; 
The glorious deeds that they have done, on land and on the sea, 
Will always live in history, and old Ireland must be free. 
Old Ireland, (Sic. 
Then keep yourselves united, with each other be at peace, 
Be never backward in your work, in good efforts never cease; 
Do or die for Ireland's sake, your watchword that should be, 
And proclaim aloud to all the world that old Ireland must be free. 
Old Ireland, & c. 
Have we not waited patiently in hopes our rights to gain, 
But we will not bear it longer, our freedom we'll maintain ; 
Then draw the sword and strike the blow, and let the tyrants see 
That each Irish heart beats true and warm, and old Ireland 
must be free. 
Old Ireland must be free, boys, 
Old Ireland must be free, boys, 
Then you soon shall see, boys, 
When Ireland must be free, boys.

PATSEY JA_RVEY. 
Song and Dance. 
Written and sung by J. M. BusKE. 
Ant—" On the Road to Brighton." 
The song I 
qm about to sing it's of an Irish Jarvey, 
Who bought a 
horse for eighteen shillings, which made him all 
com plate ; 
He was a 
regular stunner at driving horse or pony, 
lie would drive you to the world's end if the road it wasn't 
stony. 
CTIOPX13. 
Oh, boys, if you were to see him trotting, 
Patsey was the driver's name, 
And he will not be forgotten.— [Repeat chorus.] 
At the strawberry beds, sure Pat was always there, 
With his gray breeches and frieze coat, he was like the great 
Lord Mayor; 
With the reins in one hand, and the whip in the other, 
And as he drove along, the boys behind would roar out, 
Patsey—well—come down and carry your brother. 
Oh, boys, arc. 
In Sackville street one rainy day while going with a 
tack, 
The horse began his tantrums, some body gave him, 0, holy 
smack, 
Oh, murther now, says Paddy, what are you doing, 
want to send myself and this gentleman to ruin. 
Oh, beys, &o 
Oh, moral, boys, now when horses you go buy, 
Be sure, they're safe, and sound, nd anot blind of at eye, 
For you see how I 
have been taken in, 
You see I 
only had the mean bones and skin. 
Oh, boys, ctic..

THE DEAR LITTLE SHAMROCK.—[CoNcLuDED] 
That dear little plant still grows in our land, 
Fresh and fair as the daughters of Erin; 
Whose smiles can bewitch and whose eyes can command 
In each climate they ever appear in. 
For they shine thro' the bog, thro' the brake, and the mireland, 
Just like their own dear little Shamrock of Ireland: 
The dear little Shamrock, the sweet little Shamrock, 
The dear little, sweet little Shamrock of Ireland. 
That dear little plant that springs from our soil, 
When its three little leaves are extended, 
Denotes from the stalk we together should toil, 
And ourselves by ourselves be befriended. 
And still thro' the bog, thro' the brake, and the mireland, 
From one root should branch like the Shamrock of Ireland: 
The dear little Shamrock, the sweet little Shamrock, 
The dear little, sweet little Shamrock of Ireland. 
OCH! NORAH DEAR! 
061! Norah dear! I'm waiting here, 
I'm watching still for you, love : 
And while you sleep, the flow'rets weep, 
All shrined in tears of dew, love. 
The silvery moon its bright rays soon 
Behind the hills will fade, love 
But better there her beauties bear: 
For thou her beams would shade, love. 
Och! Norah dear! & e. 
Och! Norah dear ! I'm waiting here, 
The stars look cold and blue, love: 
Their twinkling rays have come to gaze, 
To see how bright are you, love ; 
The breeze that brings such balmy things 
From all that's bright and fair, love; 
It sighs to sip from thy sweet lip 
The perfume that lies there, love. 
Och! Norah dear I &c.

PADDY MAGEE; 
OR, THE TIIREE 
DREAMS. 
John Bull, he was an Englishman, and he went on tramp one 
day, 
With three pence in his pocket, to carry him on his way; 
Ha travelled for miles and miles and no one did he see, 
Till he fell in with an Irishman by the name of Paddy Magee. 
" 
Good morning," says John Bull, " Good morning, sir," says 
Pat, 
" 
Where are you going ?" says Johnny; " I'm on the road, that's 
fiat." 
"have you any money about you 2' says Johnny unto Pat, 
"It's the only thing I 
wanted, for I 
have not got a 
rap." 
They trudged along together, met a 
Scotchman on their way, 
" 
Oh, lend us a 
bob, now, Scotty, to help us on our way ;" 
" 
Lend you a 
bob," said Scotty, " faith and sure," said he, 
" 
Its the only thing I 
wanted, for I'm not worth a 
bawbee." 
" 
I 
have three pence," said the Englishman ; " what shall I 
do 
with that?" 
" 
Oh, buy three pen'orth of whiskey, it will cheer us up," said 
'Pat. 
" 
Don't do that," said the Scotchman, " I'll tell you what to do, 
Buy three pen'orth of oatmeal, and we'll all of us have burgoo." 
" 
Now with my three-pence," said the Englishman, " hal.-qnar 
tern loaf, what say ? 
And in yonder haystack we'll sleep all hunger away; 
We can quench our thirst by the running brook, beside the broil-
ing stream, 
And the loaf shall be his in the morning who dreams the largest 
dream.' 
John Bull he dreamed by the morning that ten thousand men 
had been 
For ten years digging a 
turnip up, the largest ever was seen, 
At last they got this turnip up by working night and day, 
And it took five thousand horses to draw this turnip away. 
Now, the Scotchman he dreamt by the morning ten thousand 
men had been 
For ten years making a 
boil-a-, the largest ever was seen ; 
" 
What was it made of?" said the Englishman, " was it made 
of copper or tin?" 
Said Scotty, " 'T 
was made of copper, to boil your turnip in." 
"Blood and 'ounds," said the Irishman, " I've been draming a 
very big drame, 
I 
dreamt I 
was in a 
haystack, beside of a 
broiling strame; 
I 
dreamt you, I, and Scotty was therc, 'tis true or I'm an 'oaf, 
I 
dreamt that I 
was hungry—so I 
gOt up and ate the loaf."

Och, now Paddy says he, " what is it you'd be at ?" 
Faith says 1, " you would get around me, bat ye see I've laid you 
flat," • 
And rcmember when to Biddy's ye betake yersil agin, 
There's sure to be a 
bating for the foe of Paddy Flinn. 
So I 
wished him better luck, and I 
left the spalpeen sprawling, 
And hasten'd to you Biddy, with a 
heart, love, so true. 
Thin listen to your Paddy while his tinder tale he's bawling, 
In this hard shower to let him stand, sure it is very hard in you, 
But see the door is open, so 
boldly venture in. 
Here's bad luck and betther manners to the foes of Paddy Flinn 
But see, ,te. 
MY EMMET'S NO MORE. 
Despair in her wild eye, a 
daughter of Erin 
Appear'd on the cliffs of the bleak rocky shore; 
Loose in the wind flow'd her dark streaming ringlets 
And heedless she gaz'd on the dread surge's roar. 
Loud rang her harp in wild tones of despairing; 
The time pass'd away with the present comparing, 
And in soul-thrilling strains deeper sorrow declaring, 
She sang Erin's woes and her Emmet no more. 
0, Erin, my country, your glory's departed; 
For tyrants and traitors have stabbed thy heart's core, 
Thy daughters have laved in the streams of affliction, 
Thy patriots have fled, or lie stretched in their gore, 
Ruthless ruffians now prowl thro' thy hamlets forsaken, 
From pale hungry orphans their last morsel have taken; 
The screams of thy females no pity awaken ; 
Alas I 
my poor country, your Emmet's no more. 
Brave was his spirit, yet mild as the Brahmin, 
His heart bled in anguish the wrongs of the poor; 
To relieve their hard sufferings he brav'd every danger. 
The vengeance of tyrants undauntedly bore. 
E'en before him the proud titled villains in power 
Were seen, though in ermine, in terror to cower: 
But alas 1 
he is gone—he has fallen a 
young flower. 
They have murder'd my Emmet, my Emmet's no more. 
PADDY AT THE THEATRE. 
From the county of Monaghan lately I 
came, 
I'm a 
tinker by trade, Larry Dooly's my name. 
My cousin, Tim Murphy, I 
met yesterday, 
Says he, `' Mr. Dooly ' 11 you go to the piay 1" 
Derry ; down, down ; down derry down. 
" 
Is it the play that you mean, are you sure that you'r right? 
They're treating the town with Pizzaro, to-night." 
But the treat, as he called it, and the one that I 
mean, 
Bad luck to his treat, it cost me all my tin. 
Derry down, down, down, derry down. 
Well, the green curtain drew up, and a 
lady I 
spied, 
When a 
man came to kiss her she scornfully cried, 
" 
Get out, yen big blackguard, I'll bother your jig," 
When in comes Pizzaro with a 
grunt like a 
pig. 
Derry down, down, down, derry down. 
In the days of mild Goury a 
long time ago, 
The Spaniards claimed war. ' gainst Peru you know; 
They demanded its cash, its jewels and keys. 
When a 
boy they called Howler, says, " No, if you please." 
Derry down, down, down, derry down. 
Then Howler came on, like a 
day- star appeared, 
lie made a 
long speech, and the sogers all cheer'd, 
Says he. " beat well the Spaniards, and do the neat thing, 
And then boys, stand up for your oountry and King. 
Derry down, down, down, derry down. 
Then Mr. Murphy Alonzo, somehow went to jail, 
lie got out by a 
back door witheut giving bail, 
While Howler was jumping oe'r bridges and greens, 
lie was shot by some blackguard behind the big screens. 
Derry down, down, down, derry down. 
Then Howler came forward, and with him a 
child, 
Looking all for the world like a 
man that was ; 
" 
Here's your gossoon, dear Cora, for it's my blood that's spilt. 
In defence of your child, blood- an ounds I'm kilt." 
Derry down, down, down. derry down. 
Then Alonzo, and Pizzaro, had a 
terrible fight, 
Pizzaro got killed, that seemed perfectly right. 
For the audience came down with showers of applause, 
They were all enlisted in the Peruvian's cause_ 
Derry down, down, down, derry down. 
Then Alonzo came forward and handsomely bowed, 
Saying, " Ladies and gentlemen," meaning, the crowd; 
" 
By your kind permission, to-morrow, then, 
Wu will murder Pizzarro over again." 
Derry down, down, down, deny down,

THE ROCKY ROAD TO DUBLIN. 
Ant ; " Irish Jig." 
In the merry month of June, when first from home I 
etartea. 
And left the girls alone, sad and broken hearted, 
Shook hands with Father dear, kissed my darling Mother, 
Drank a 
pint of beer my tears and grief to smother: 
Then off to reap the corn and leave where I 
was born, 
I 
cut a 
stout black- thorn, to banish ghost or goblin: 
With a 
pair of bran new brogues I 
rattled o 
er the bogs: 
Sur. I 
frightened all the dogs en the rocky road to Dublin. 
CHORUS. 
For, it is the rocky road, here's the road to Dublin 
Here's the rocky road, now fire away to Dublin! 
The steam- coach was at hand, the driver said he'd cheap ones 
But sure, the luggage van was too much for ray ha'pen^o. 
For England I 
was bound it would never do to balk it; 
For every step of the to d, be dad says I, I'll wolk it. 
I 
did nor sigh nor moan until I 
saw Athlone_ 
A p 
in in my shin bone, It set my heart a 
bubbling ; 
A 
rid fearing the big cannon, looking o'er the Shannap, 
I 
very quickly ran on the rocky road to Dublin, 
For, it is the rocky road - 
In Mullingar that night I 
rested limbs so weary— 
Started by daylight, with spirits light and airy ; 
Took a 
drop el the pure, to keep my spirits from sinking. 
That's always an Irishman s 
cure, whenever he's troubled 
with thinking 
o 
see the lasses smile, lauoiling all the while 
At my comical style • set my he irt a 
bubbling ; 
They axed if I 
was hired, the wages I 
required, 
Until I 
was almost tired of the rocky road to Dublin. 
For, it is the rocky road, Cto 
In Dublin next arrived— I 
thought it WAS a 
pity 
To be so soon deprived ef a 
view of that fine city 
'Twas then I 
took a 
stroll all among the quality*. 
ikty bundle then was stole in a 
neat locality. 
THE ROCKY ROAD TO DUBLIN.—[craNcLuDvai.1 
Something crossed my mind—thinks I, I'll look behind--
No bundle could I 
find upon my stick a 
wobbling. 
Inquiring for the rogue, they said my Connaught brogue 
It wasn't much in vogue on the rocky road to Dublin. 
For, it is the rocky road, <to. 
A coachman raised his hand, as if myself was wanting— 
I 
went up to a 
stand full of cars for jaunting. 
Step up, my boy, says he, ah, ha! that I 
will with pleasure— 
tild to the strawberry beds I'll drive you, at your leisure. 
it 
strawberry bed, says I, faith that would be too high, 
On one of straw I'll lie, and the berries won't be troubling. 
He drove me out as far,upon an outside car— 
Faith such jolting never were on the rocky road to Dublin. 
For, it was the rocky road, cte. 
I 
soon got out of that, my spirits never failing-
1 
landed on the quay just as the ship was sailing. 
The Captain at me roared, swore that no room had he, 
But when I 
leaped on board, they a 
cabinfound for Paddy 
Down among the pigs I 
played such rummy rigs, 
Danced some hearty jigs, with the water round me bubbliag, 
But when off Holyhead, I 
wished that I 
was dead, 
Or safely put in bed, on the rocky road to Dublin. 
For, it is the rocky road, &o. 
The boys in Liverpool, when in the dock I 
landed, 
Called myself a 
fool— I 
could no longer stand it; 
My blood began to boil, my temper I 
was losing, 
And poor Old Erin's Isle they all began abusing. 
Hurrah my boys, says 1, my Shillalah I 
let fly: 
Some Galway boys were by, they saw I 
was a 
hobble in: 
Then, with a 
loud Hurrah, they joined me in the fray; 
Faugh-a-ballagh! clear the way for the rocky road to Dublin, 
For, it is the rocky road, lte.

Written and sung with great success by J. M. BURKE, Irish Comedian 
There's an Isle bevant the Sea, 
Where Irishmen should be, 
To guard both night and day tenderly. 
But absent from their home 
To other lands they roam, 
From Ireland Gramachree, Gramachree. 
Ah, poor unhappy land, 
Thy best sons bear the brand, 
Of Prison Exile— and alas—for thee 
Still round our hearts entwined, 
And in its core enshrined,

Our island is the fairest, 
Our Island is the dear ,

Unhappy are thy children o'er the Sea,

You don't how know happy I'll be; 
I've but one darling wish, and that is that you'd come 
And for ever be happy with me! 
I'll smile when you smile, and I'll weep when you weep. 
I'll give you a 
kiss for a 
kiss, 
And all the fond vows that I've made you, I'll keep— 
What more can I 
promise than this ? 
D.)es the sea have such bright and such beautiful charms 
That your heart will not leave it for me P 
Oh! why did I 
let you go out of my arms, 
Like a 
bird that was caged and is free I 
Oh 1

And my heart is still trusting and kind; 
It was you who first took it, and can you forget, 
That love for another you'd find ? 
No! no! if you break it with sorrow and pain, 
I'll then have a 
duty to do ; 
If you'll bring it to me, I'll mend it again, 
And trust it, dear Shamus, to you.

THE SAD AND SWEET " GOOD NIGHT." 
The sweet west wind is flying, 
Over the purple sea; 
And the amber daylight dying 
On roadway, hill and tree; 
The cattle- bells are ringing 
Among the slanting downs, 
And children's voices flinging 
Glad echoes through the towns, 
Oh summer day so soon away, 
,‘ 
I 
he happy hearted sigh and say— 
Sweet is the light, and sad thy flight, 
And sad the words " Good night !" 
Good night I" 
And sad the words " Good night I" " Goot: night !" 
The wan white clouds are trailing 
Low o'er the level plain; 
And th wind brings with its wailings, 
The chill of coining rains. 
Fringed by the faded heather, 
Wide pools of water lie; 
And birds and leaves together 
Whirl through the ev'ning sky. 
" 
Haste thee away, 0

The weary hearted sigh and say— 
Sad is thy light, and slow thy flight. 
Sweet were the words " Good night!" " Good night :" 
Sweet were the words " Good night !" " Good night !"

THE TWIG OF THE SHANNON. 
On the beautiful banks of the Shannon, 
There grows such an illagant tree, 
And the first that it bears is shilalah, 
I've a 
sprig of it hero you may see. 
'Tis tee remnant of all my large fortune, 
it's the friend that ne'er played me a 
trick, 
And I'd rather lose half my supportin' 
Than part with this illagant stick. 
CHORUS. 
'Twas a 
delicate sprig in the summer, 
When I 
first cut it from the tree. 
And I've kept it through all the cold weather, 
Faix the sprig of shilalah for me. 
It's the porter that carried my luggage, 
For I've shouidered it many a 
mile. 
And from thieves it will safely protect me, 
In a 
beautiful delicate style. 
It is useful for rows in the summer. 
And when winter comes on with a 
storm, 
If you're short of a 
fire in the cabin, 
You can burn it to keep yourself warm. 
'Twas a 
delicate sprig, &c. 
It's a 
friend both so true and so constant, 
It's constancy pen cannot paint, 
For it always is there when it's wanted, 
And sometimes its there when it aint. 
It beats all your guns and your rifles, 
For it goes off whene'er you desire, 
And it's sure to hit what' er it's aimed at, 
For shilalahs they never miss fire, 
'Twas a 
delicate sprig, &c. 
It's a

WHAT IRISH BOYS CAN DO. 
Answer to " No Irish Need Apply," as sung by J. M. Bututz. 
(they insult an Irishman, and think nought of what they say. 
They'll call him green, an Irish bull ; it happens every dey ; 
Now to these folks I'll say a word ; to sing a 
song I'll try, 
And answer to these dirty words : " No Irish need apply i" 
So, if you'll give attention I'll sin , my song to you, 
And the subject of this song shall be : What Irish boys can do. 
ff you'd come to Ireland they'd treat you well I'm sure, 
['at would share his last potato with the destitute and poor ; 
If you were sick and weary, and had no place to rest, 
The bed you'd get, though poor perhaps, would be Pat's very best; 
He'd nurse yen, too ; he would that, and give you whisky, too ; 
And you cannot find a 
no bl er ac t 
than Irishmen can do. 
OM you ever know an Irishman from any danger flinch ? 
In fighting, too, he d 
rather die than give his toe an inch ; 
Among the bravest in the world are the sons of Erin's green Isle. 
Sure, the Iron Duke of Wellington was a 
native of the soil, 
And didn't he badly whip the French on the plains of Waterloo? 
Which plainly showed to the whole world what Irishmen can do. 
Old Ireland's had her warriors, who fought both true and bravo, 
Pat's assisted every nation, on the land and on the wave. 
And poets, too, she's had ; yes, may and many a 
score; 
Where can you find much brighter stars than Lover or Tom Moore ? 
Old Ireland's had her actors, and authors not a 
few ; 
And things of wit aldi humor the Irish all can do. 
Did you ne'er hear tell of Sheridan, or lamented Catharine rayes' 
Did you ne'er see fun in Irish songs, or laugh at Irish plays ? 
01(1 Ireland's had her statestu n ; their fame the wide world ring 
She's likewise had musicians to tune her old harp strings! 
Not all Dish girls are beautiful, but then they'r,• always true, 
And for faith and genercAity the Irish girls will do. 
And then, to o, in the present war between the North and South, 
Let no dirty slur on Irish ever escape your mouth ; 
Sure, (lid you ne'er hear tell of the 6th, who bravely fought at mil) 
Ituii ? 
Anti Meagher. of the seven days' fight that was in front of Richmond, 
With General Shields, who fought so brave for the Flag Bed, White 
and Blue ? 
And anything ; Hie, the bayonet-ehaage, the Irish boys can do. 
Then, why slur upon the Irish ? Why are they treated so ? 
What is it you have against them ? is What I 
want to know. 
sure, they work for all they get, and that you can't deay ! 
Then. why insult t • em with the words: No Irish need apply ? 
It you want, to find t 
heir principles. go search the wide world through, 
&PA) you'll fine all things that's noble the Irish folks can do.

WATERFORD BOYS. 
Ara :—" The Flaming O'Flannigans." 
Well, boys, for divarsion, we all met together; 
I'll tell you how from Waterford hither I 
came, 
I 
left that dear city in dark, gloomy weather, 
My heart it was light, and my pockets the sams. 
I 
lilted a 
song as I 
tripped it along; 
By the road-side a 
tavern I 
happened to spy, 
4nd, as I 
was meltin', my pockets I 
felt in 
For the price of a 
drink; I 
was mortally dry. 
CHORUS. 
But we are the boys for fun, wit, and element, 
Drinking, and dancing, and all other joys, 
Ructions, destruction, divarsion, and devilment; 
Who can compare with the Waterford Boys ? 
In the tavern I 
strolied, out the landlord he rolled; 
Good mornin', says he. 
Says I: If you please, 
Could you shake me a 
bed, but first bring some bread, 
With a 
bottle of porter and small lump of cheese ? 
For, times they are queer, and provisions are dear; 
If you cannot get meat, with cheese be content. 
Says the landlord: You're right, as he brought me the bite; 
So, I 
rolled up my sleeves and at it I-went. 
Ve are the boys, J:e. 
idy bread and cheese ended, I 
then condescended 
To seek my repose: so, I 
bade 'em good-night. 
Soon under the clothes I 
was trying to doze, 
But first popped in my toes, and then popped out the light. 
Not long was I 
sleeping, I 
heard something creeping, 
And meandering, and scratching about the bed-post. 
WATERFORD BOYS.—[CONCLUDED.1 
My breath I 
suspended, but the noise never ended: 
Thinks I; ye have mighty long claws for a 
ghost! 
We are the boys, ctc. 
The row it commences: near out of my senses, 
I 
ventured to peep from beneath the bed-clothes. 
Milla murther! what's that ? 'Twas a 
big black jack rat, 
With a 
leap from the floor, came a 
top of my nose. 
Divil sware ye! says I, for a 
scheming ould vagabone; 
Take that, and that. 
I 
jumped on the floor; 
Oh! Moses; blue fire, Biddy! Sophia ! 
The rats they are eating me up by the score Y 
We are the boys, die.c. 
The landlord affrightened, he then brought a 
light in. 
Says I: I'm Lear dead, it's time I'm away; 
Says he: Before going, I'd have ye be knowing, 
For supper and bed you've five shillings to pay. 
Five shillings! for what ? Now, don't be disgracing 
Yourself as a 
rogue, says I, if you please; 
When I 
can't sleep for rats, you've the divil's own face on ye. 
To charge me five shillings for plain bread and cheese 
We are the boys, dx. 
Says he: Och ! those rats, I 
wish they would leave me, 
They ruin my trade. 
I'm not worth a 
rap. 
Says I: The five shillings now would you forgive me, 
If I 
tell you the way to keep out every rat ? 
I 
will.—Says I: Then to supper invite them, 
And plain bread and cheese set before them, be sure, 
Don't mind if they're willing, but charge them five shillings, 
Bad luck to the tat that yell ever see more ! 
We are the boys, cEc.

WHERE THE GRASS GROWS GREEN. 
I'm Denny Blake from County Clare, 
And hero, at your command, 
To sing a 
song in praise of home, 
And my own native land ! 
I've sailed to foreign counteries, 
And in many climes I've been, 
But my heart is still with Erin, 
Where the grass grows green. 
CHORUS. 
I 
love may native country, 
And the' richer land's I've seen. 
Yet I 
can't forget OuId Erin, 
Where the grass grows green. 
Poor Pat is often painted 
With a 
ragged coat and hat; 
His heart and hospitality, 
Has much to do with that. 
Let slanderers say what they will, 
They cannot call him mean; 
Sure, a 
stranger's always welcome 
Where the grass grows green. 
I 
love my, &C;„ 
He's foolish, but not vicious, 
His faults I 
won't defend ; 
His purse to help the orphan, 
his life to serve a 
Wend, 
He'll give. without a 
in 
his follies try and screen ; 
For, there's noble hearts in Et-in, 
Where the grass grows green. 
I 
love my, er.o. 
'Tis true he has a 
weakness 
For a 
drop of something pure, 
But that's a 
slight debility 
That many more endure. 
He's fond of fun, he's witty, 
Though his wit ' tis not too keen; 
For, there's feeling hearts in Erin, 
Where the grass grows green. 
I 
love my, 
There's not a 
true-born Irishman, 
Wherever lie may be, 
But loves the little Emerald 
That sparkles on the sea. 
May the sun of bright prosperity 
Shine peaceful and serene, 
And bring better days to Erin. 
Where the grass grows green! 
For I 
love my, 8z.e. 
Allirobas. 
57 
THE WHISTLING THIEF. 
When Pat came o'er the hills his colleen fair to see, 
His whistle, loud and shrill, his signal was to be. 
Oh! Mary, the mother cried, there's some one whistling surl 
Oh! Mother, you know, it's the wind that's whistling through 
the door. 
(Whistles: Garry Owen.) 
I've lived a 
long time, Mary, in this wide world, my dear, 
But the wind to whistle like that, I 
never yet did hear. 
But, mother, you know, the fiddle hangs close behind the chink, 
And the wind upon the strings is playing a 
tune, I 
think. 
(Dog barks.) 
The dog is barking now, and the fiddle can't play that tune. 
But,"Mother, you know that dogs will bark, when they see the 
moon. 
Now, how can he see the moon, when you know he's old and 
blind ? 
Blind dogs can't see the moon, nor fiddles be played by the 
wind, 
(Pig grunts.) 
And now there is the pig uneasy in his mind. 
but, Mother, you know, they say that pigs can see the wind. 
That's all very well in the day, but then I 
may remark 
That pigs, no more than we, can sec anything in the dark. 
Now, I'm not such a 
fool as you think, I 
know very well it is 
Pat, 
Get out 
you -whistling thief, and get along home out o' that. 
And you, be off to your bed, and don't bother me with your 
tears; 
For, tho' I've lost my eyes, I 
have not lost my ears.. 
M ORAL. 
Now, Boys, too near the house don't courting go, d.'ye mind ? 
Unless you're certain sure the old woman's both deaf and blind; 
The days when they were young, forget they never can ; 
They're sure to tell the difference 'twixt wind, fiddle, pig, dog. 
or man. 
WAKE NOT THAT HARP AGAIN. 
Wake not that harp again, 
No hands but mine may sweep, 
Impulsive o'er the strings, 
Let its hushed echoes sleep. 
For plaintive notes of war, 
Might mingle in its strain; 
That harp is silent now, 
Why should it wake again. 
Once music soft and sweet, 
Rang from this gentle lyre ; 
Love taught it dulcet notes, 
Faith gave it sacred fire, 
Though love may linger still, 
And hope vet wear a 
smile, 
Faith shrinking, trembling, stands, 
Doubting ' tween truth and guile. 
Not heav'n can tempt its flight, 
No hope its bloom restore, 
Wake not that harp again, 
it ne'er must vibrate more. 
For plaintive notes of war, 
Might mingle in its strain, 
That harp is silent now, 
Why should it wake again.

I'LL WAIT AT THE GATE FOR TREE, 
Farewell, farewell, my darling wife, 
Farewell my mother dear! 
Father, mine was a 
happy life, 
Made so by kindred dear; 
But now the angels call me home. 
From toil and care to be free, 
Trust on lov'd wife, tho' now alcne. 
I'll wait at the gate for thee! 
Trust on lov'd wife, tho' now alone, 
I'll wait at the gate for thee! 
Tell sisters all how deep I 
lov'd, 
My younger brothers too; 
But, darling wife, more dear than all, 
I'm thinking now of you; 
Hush ! dont you hear sweet voices call 
To heav'n I 
go from thee, 
Trust on lov'd wife, they still do call, 
I'll wait at the gate for thee ? 
Trust oil lov'd wife, they still do call, 
wait at the gate for thee ?

THE WAKE OF MR. O'LEARY. 
A111:--" King of the Cannibal Islands." 
In Ireland, so I've heard, 
To wake the dead they have a 
way, 
They get dead drunk, and on the Mire, do lay 
At the wake of Mr. O'Leary. 
Be whit quite dead, one Sunday night, 
Which put his friends in sad affright, 
From this world be had taken flight, 
So they drank his health with all their might. 
They danced and reeled about, Oh, dear, 
For the whiskey made 'em feel so queer, 
I'm sure they had the best of cheer, 
At the wake of Mr. O'Leary. 
CHORUS. 
Swearing, tearing, all the night, 
Putting; whiskey out of sight, 
Good cheer, did all the guests invite, 
At the wake of Mr. O'Leary. 
Turas in the first flure under ground, 
'Where all the mirth, sure, did abound, 
And where the whiskey, quick whit round, 
At the wake of Mr. O'Leary. 
There was a 
policeman off his bate, 
Among the rest, came to the fate, 
And rowled about like many a 
baste, 
I'm sure he did not drink the laste. 
Then Saul's (lead march, the piper played, 
lint I 
am told he ne'er got paid, 
To spako the truth I'm not afraid, 
About the wake of Mr. O'Leary. 
Swearing, tearing, tee. 
'Twas in the middle of the fun, 
I 
think just at the hour of one, 
The guests they mighty quick did run, 
From the wake of Mr. O'Leary. 
O'Leary, if I 
don't mistake, 
Thought it high time, that he should wake. 
Wid fear, says ho, I'll make 'cm quake, 
So he gave the coffin a 
sudden shake, 
Thin ould Leary loud did cry, 
This waking me is all me eye, 
For I 
niver did intind to die, 
I 
didn't says Mr. O'Leary. 
Swearing, tearing, &o. 
For help the guests quite loud did call, 
Och, murder, thieves, each one did bawl 
Och, wasn't there a 
precious squall, 
At the wake of Mr. O'Leary. 
Old Leary thin did come to view, 
And at the company he flew. 
And bate them all sure, black and blue, 
Och, 'pen my soul all this is thrue. 
Some on crutches hobbled home, 
And swore again!they ne'er would roam, 
While others loud, with pains did groan, 
With the bating they got from O'Leary. 
Swearing, tearing, & c.

A fortune he had, too :— his birch and his wig, 
A black ugly cow, and an old dirty pig,
