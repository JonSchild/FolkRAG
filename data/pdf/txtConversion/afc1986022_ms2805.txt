I come to town to see. That's about it, you know, if the kids go to church they can meet
somebody, but that's about the only place I know.
Q: Is there a church up in your neighborhood?

Q: Which church does your mom and sister go to?
R: They go to the Baptist church.
Q: Is that in an area where you live, does the church seem like a very important part of
people's lives, or is it just someplace to go on Sunday?

Q: Not everybody goes. What do you think, can you think of some ideas, attitudes that
C 40 page 2
your folks ( ) to think that are different from like maybe attitudes about long hair, short
skirts, or ( ) to do things, whatever.
R: Yeah. My dad says that everbody who has long hair is a hippie or a freak, and Mom,
she don't like short skirts, she says. Anybody that wears short skirts is asking for trouble
or, you know what I mean.
Q: So what do you think about it? Do you agree with them, or do you feel that your
attitude, you know, toward the way you dress ( ) is different?
R: Well, I think it's the way you act instead of the way that you dress. If you have long hair
and if you keep it clean and neat, you know, it don't look so bad.

R: He likes to watch detective shows, you know--"Hawaii Five-0", "Canon"--he likes
Canon.
Q: Yeah, I like "Canon", too. I think he's getting fatter, though. What, do you think there's
sort of a division in people's minds, let's say people who live in Jackson and people
who live out? Do you understand what I mean? Do the people sort of group themselves
according to, oh, who live in Jackson and who lives out of town?
R: I don't really know all that many people in Jackson to know of it. I guess, you know,
there's people in Jackson who go to church as injects, and most of time, and don't really
get out.You know, they, they're closer to town people, you know, close to the stores and
traffic, you know, and things like that.
Q: Can you think of some pleasures that you've had that you think were really worse than
others? Have you had any teachers, you know, since you've started school in the first
grade that you really think have been bad?
R: You mean bad that they didn't teach me anything?
Q: Well, bad because either you didn't like them, something about their personalities, or
they didn't teach you anything, any reason that you didn't like them.
R: Well, there's been a few, you know, that I didn't like. They were grouchy or, you know,
something like that. But I guess most kids think that way about teachers.

Q: Have there been any that you just thought, you know, were sort of special, you know,
better than others?
R: You mean one that I liked?
Q: Yeah.
R: Let me see. I liked, no, I'd better not say that!
Q: It doesn't matter, you know, you don't have to tell me the name, just what it was you
liked.
R: I liked a math teacher I had one time. You know, he explained, I like some teacher that
explained things, you know, and not just sit up there, you know, or just to draw a page, try,
or really try to teach us students. And be interested, you know, in what they're doing.

don't, do the buses leave at 3:30?

that.
Q: Are there a lot of people who have food stamps?
R: Yeah, most, a lot of people in Jackson and around the county do.
Q: Has your family ever been in a position where you've needed food stamps?
R: I guess we could use them, you know, but, you know food costs a lot, and we could use
them if we had them, but we don't really have to have them. But you know we can get by
without them.
Q: 'Cause of the garden and everything?

know, and lie about it. They ..
Q: What do they lie about?
C 40 page 8
R: Oh, you know, they'll say they'll be out of work. And, you know, they're not really out of
work. They just going out just to get the stamps.
Q: Does, I mean do the people in your brother's office catch those people, or do they ...?
R: Well, sometimes you do, but there's not really much,you know, you have to, Junior
says you have to call them ahead of time for you to visit them. And you can't check up on
something they've told, you know. Like they tell you they're not, they've been fired, they've
been laid off somewhere, you can't call the people they were working for and ask about it.
Q: I wonder why not?
R: I don't know. I assume that they just said you couldn't.
Q: Has he said that there are a lot of people around on food stamps? Any idea how many?
The percentage or anything?

R: No, but you can tell there's a lot because you can go in a grocery store and watch the
people check out and then a lot of them pay with food stamps.
Q: ( ) you were saying how sometimes you go to the grocery store and get in line and
somebody with real fancy clothes comes up.
R: Yeah.
Q: And then pull out their food stamps.
R: Yeah, they do that. And you know, people's food stamps, usually buy the more
expensive things, and you know, if you had to pay for it with money, then you'd get
yourself.
Q: Don't people have to pay something for the food stamps?
C 40 page 9
R: Well, it depends on how much money you've got coming in. Or how much you tell
you've got coming in. If you get, if you don't get any money, you don't have to pay anything
at all.
Q: It's free, huh? You don't have to pay ( ).

R: And if, if you've got some money coming in you pay, you know, according to what you
make.
Q: How do they buy, I mean how do they get food stamps? Are they like a certain, a
certain amount, a certain dollar amount in a book, or how's that worked out?
R: You can get, let's see, there's five-dollar books and some are fifty cents, I think, and a
dollar and ten dollars and twenty dollars. And they come in little books, you know, and you
just tear them out and use them like you would money.
Q: That's very interesting. ( )?
R: In the bank?
Q: Somebody was talking about that ( ). That's not true though?
R: I don't think so!
Q: Well, the person didn't really know, but they said they thought that they had seen, you
know, the people who work in the bank giving out food stamps.
R: I don't think they do. I thought they got them up here, you know, in the office that gave
out food stamps.

Q: Well, this person was wrong, maybe, because the person didn't really, wasn't really
sure about it. What about, are there a lot of people, are the same people who get food
stamps the same people who are on welfare?
