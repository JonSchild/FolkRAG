The Men Who Swung a Pick at Panama

By ©. H. GORDON
‘They used to talk a lot about The Man Behind the Gun,
‘The mainstay of the old Red, White and Blue,
‘And when they were not talking of the things that he had done
‘They were boasting of the things that he could do,
But I would like to see the man behind the gun down here
Where there isn't any glory to be won,
‘And where the only enemies to fight or fear
Are the dobie-itch, the fever and the sua,
For it’s Dig, Dig, Dig,
‘Though the lizards may be big,
And the pay we get will never make us rich,
Still we're here to dig this allied ditch, ditch, ditch
We're here to dig this all-fied ditch,

‘They say the Frenchmen started a canal here years ago,
‘But they had to give it up, it got too hot,
‘They said that it was hotter than —you know, way down below
‘And I'd be the last to say that it was not.
But when your Uncle Sam has started out a job to do,
He buckles down and then his teeth he grits,
Now Teddy started this one and Big Bill will see it through,
You can bet your life your Uncle never quits.
‘Then it's Dig, Dig, Dig,
For we're doing something big,
You can hear the picks way up at Gatun Dam
For we're digging for your Uncle Sem, Sam, Sem,
Were digging for your Uncle Sam.

We're going to get a medal when we fnish this campaign,
So that folks will know just what we have been through;
‘The man who does the shooting always gets a bunch of fame
‘And we're going to get a little of it too
Weld like the girls to smile at us as we stroll down Broadway
‘We like to hear the newsboys ery “ Hurrah, ”
‘We'd like to have the people, when they pass us, say
“There's a man who swung a pick at Panama.”
So it’s Dig, Dig, Dig,
And well do it to a jig,
We can hear the people as they cry “Hurrah,
For the Man who Swung a Pick at Pa-na-ma,”
‘Who swung a pick at Pa-na-ma.

"Twill be a glorious morning when we drop our picks, you bet;
‘Oh won't we be the Hallalujah crew
‘When we dig up the last spadeful and let in the mighty wet
‘And we watch the ships as they go sailing through.
‘When the band strikes up the music and Old Glory is unfurled
‘And we cheer it as our weary labors cease
While in war we're undefeated, we will show the world
That they've still to get ahead of us in peace.
Then it's Dig, Dig, Dig,
Were the noise that’s Big, Big, Big,
‘And your Uncle Samuel will ery “ Hurrah ”
For the Man who Swung a Pick at Pa-na-ma
Who Swung a Pick at Pa-na-ma.
