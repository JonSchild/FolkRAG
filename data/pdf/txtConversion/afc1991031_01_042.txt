"hay" / water rights 
Knorr Bros. Ranch, Summit County Aug 80 
"hay" means the conglomeration of small native and domestic grasses 
harvested and stored for feeding cattle (here, Herefords) during 
the winter on the home ranch 
during the summer (June—Oct), the cattle (300 +) graze on 
the U.S. Forest Service allottment across the Blue Valley 
("Blue Ridge" allottment, Williams Fork Mountains) 
composition of the "hay" being harvested and put up in loose stacks: 
timothy (seeded at some time in past, but now thrives on its own) 
clover ( " ) 
rye grass (a nuisance grass) 
fox tail (another wild nuisance grass) 
V.J 
red top 
wild sedge 
winter wheat (wild) 
fan weed 
dandelion 
bluegrass (seeded at some time in past but now on its own; good) 
brome ( " ) 
-this is generally called "timothy and clover hay" since it is 
mostly composed of those excellent grasses 
► C L 
hayfields /"hay meadows" are carved out of original sagebrush and rabbitgrass- 
covered ground and maintained with steady irrigation from nearby creeks 
hay meadows not maintained by watering through the ditches eventually 
return to sagebrush; meadows need constant water flow 
Denver Water Board, et alia, check to see if ranchers are using their 
"water rights"—that is, irrigating their fields continually. If a rancher 
goes 3 or more years without using the water he's entitled to, any other 
person or organization can file a claim on the "right" at the county 
courthouse and take the use of the water from the rancher.... 
Water rights established by prior claim—the original homestead.

Random sparkles from the wheel. "Notes,'1 that is. 
re: Colorado Rockies — I houses REF: Glassie (PATTERN book, and MIDDLE 
VIRGINIA book) 
Nothing in these basic works showing I houses quite like the Dave Doig 
or the Karl Knorr (Judge Guyselman ) houses in their floorplans. 
That is: the placement of the stairway in the Rocky Mountain 
I houses differs, having been put on the back wall (Doig hse.) 
or a far wall(outside wall) as in the Guyselmann house. 
Essential floorplans are similar to Virginia, "Eastern" stuff in Glassie 
and to Little Dixie (Missouri) stuff in my book and to Indiana houses 
I've recorded, but the stairway placement is significantly different. 
CAUSE: the extreme high altitude and accompanying low temperatures, 
long winters, etc.? COLDER weather for longer—may mean putting the 
stairs on margin of the plan makes more room for people, activity in the 
center of the house. Stairs take up space, and are used for getting 
up and down from the second story. Long winters; longer than in Indiana, 
although Indiana is certainly a cold place (due to humidity, environment, 
may seem "colder" than Rockies where temperature is actually lower....). 
See xeroxed pp. 68-9 from Henry Glassie, PATTERN IN THE MATERIAL FOLK CULTURE OF THE 
EASTERN UNTED STATES (Phila: Univ. Pa. Press 1968) — his example "A" 
in Virginia Tidewater (Sussex Co., far southeast) is the Colorado 
plan with stairs in center rather than at edge of the floorplan.)p« 68).

SOUTHERN I HOUSE PLANS 
A. Two-room plan; frame with brick chimneys, between Wavcrly and 
Homcvillc, Sussex County, Virginia (July, 1963). The early two-room T 
houses generally have such asymmetrical plans; later examples often 
have rooms of equal size and occasionally two front doors. IS. Central 
hall, Georgian subtype; frame with stone chimneys, between Madison 
and Shelby, Madison County, Virginia (July, 1962). C. Two-thirds 
Georgian subtype; square-notched log, with brick chimney, south of 
Bumpass, Louisa County, Virginia (July, 1963). A, B and C all had rear 
appendages which have been removed to reveal more clearly the basic 1 
house subtypes. D. Plan of house in Fig. 19 A; central hall I house with 
front porch and rear shed. The shed is divided into three; the central 
section, as is not unusual in the Lowland South, was left open to serve 
as a porch. E. Frame two-thirds Georgian I house subtype with one- 
story rear kitchen ell and internal stove flues, south of Unionville, 
Orange County, Virginia (June, 1968).

Dub made of tape recording C080-B0-R1 25 Nov 80 by Marshall. 
General description of contents of this tape: 
Reel-to-reel tape recording number C080-B0-R1. Made on Nagra E (full track 
monophonic, with Sennheiser mike). Howard W. Marshall assisted with recording, 
and did photography. Tape speed 7% ips. 
Subject: Mrs. I.W. (Vera) McKee -- irrigating hay meadow on land leased 
from Wheaton College (Iowa). West side of Blue River, on edge 
of Arapahoe National Forest, just off Colo. Highway 9, Summit Co. 
Interviewed by Barbara Orbach. Recordist duty shared by Orbach and Marshall. 
TIME ON ORIGINAL TAPE COUNTER 
1:00 Vera discusses the property; leased land from the college. 
1:30 It's called a "hay meadow." Grazing land for cattle that has to be 
carefully irrigated / watered. This meadow was never cleared of 
sagebrush; apparently was always open (at least in memory: HM). 
McKees have "60 pair and two bulls" grazing here (60 pair = cows and 
their calves). Cattle bought from Wayne Brown, Limon, who hauls them 
in to the McKee Ranch in the fall; McKees feed them and sell them 
later on the market. 
There is a "big hay meadow on top" of the hill above this hay meadow. 
This hay meadow elevation c. 9100 feet. Elevation of their ranch 8200'.

Fence divides Arapho* National Forest from the College's property; 
A 
it forms boundary line that runs through the trees. 
Ranches lease land from the Forest Service exclusively in this part 
of the valley; all the"BLM"(Bureau of Land Management, Department of 
Interior: HM) land has been moved into Forest Service (Department 
of Agriculture) jurisdiction and control for convenience of operation. 
5:00 "holes" = outlets Vera is closing and opening along the downhill 
side of the main big ditch bringing water down from the creek. She 
works along the ditch with a long-handled shovel, digging out holes 
where she wants water to go out and filling in other holes with 
mud / dirt she digs up when she encounters a smaller ditch that 
* 
she wants closed off. 
Discussion of the irrigation method. Water comes from Boulder 
Crik (Creek). There is one large "diversion" (diversion ditch) 
at Boulder Creek with a gate and measuring point ("measuring box": HM) 
where the water comes out to feed other ditches further along. 
7:00 "water right" discussed. Important feature in ranching.... 
Plentiful water here in this area, but others use it too, such as 
local cities and the Denver Water Board. 
9:00 This is a dry year. 
11:00 B0 takes over the Nagra and microphone outfit to continue the recording 
HM began. 
13:00 Vera grew up in Texas (they movdd here from Breckenridge, TX: HM); 
father a farmer. They like ranching, working 1n the open. 
She works daily with the water this time of year. Most of the work 
is done 1n the spring however. 
*same shovel type used in Nevada ranching, and elsewhere (HM) 
Marshall notes on C080-B0-R1

15:00 Shovel is the only tool necessary for changing water / irrigation. 
But tractor and implement does the heavy "cleaning" of the 
ditches (periodically: HM). Vera works alone, mostly, and likes 
it (accompanied by her dog; name "Tiger?": HM). 
16:00 Fencing takes two people (spring work). 
17:00 She learned to irrigate here in Colorado; not done back in Texas. 
Learned by "trial and error." 
"We both love this kind of work." (They'd like to ranch full-time, but 
it is not economically possible; IW McKee drives dump truck: HM) 
The recording is being made as Vera works along the ditch, "changing water." 
19:00 Water flows by gravity through ditch system, over / into the hay meadow. 
20:00 They buy their hay from neighboring ranchers, so they don't have 
to put up their own. Hay is cheaper to buy from ranchers if you 
buy it in the field (already baled but not moved: HM). Costs more 
if you buy it from ranch after it has been transported back to his 
ranch; would cost still more if delivered to your own place (HM). 
23:00 We walk along the main ditch to the higher hay meadow; Vera wanted 
us to see it. "It's beautiful." (And it is indeed; also contains 
the wreckage of a saddle-notched log field barn which HM recorded 
for the architectural record.) 
24:00 vegetataion discussed, and description is begun by Vera. Samples 
taken by HM & B0. Brome, clover, _ (Vera can't remember name 
of third grass we see at this point. Later we get more specimens and 
identify them.) 
Marshall notes on C080-B0-R1

26:00 Fencing description: brief discussion. Barbed wire fences are 
put at the edge of aspens (with steel posts or homemade wooden 
posts they make); aspens grow thickly as young trees and help 
provide an effective barrier to the grazing cattle. 
Spring is the time of fence building, repairing (just like in 
Frost... and like with ranchers & farmers everywhere: HM). 
27:00 Her dad worked by the signs. But Vera does not. He did many 
things by the moon phases ("by the signs")--hog killing, fence 
making, gardening / planting, etc. 
* Vera does not go by the signs, but she is very aware of them 
and aware of the real utility of this seemingly-obsolete custom. 
"I know that the sign for the garden works." —the case of the 
peas that wouldn't grow (father in TX; peas; old man taught him 
about using the signs....). (Important narrative, important 
material: HM.) 
"It's true." It works. 
Carrots, lettuce, turnips can be grown in a garden here (high altitude 
mountain environment), but the growing season is really too short 
(and the soils wrong: HM) for good gardens. 
31:00 Temperature was 31 degrees at the ranch this morning. (20Aug80) 
32:00 Discussion of plants; tape ends. (MATERIAL CONTINUES ON NEXT TAPE)

Such is the style and content of the team members' fieldnotes. 
I am now inserting portions of information from my observations and 
daily round--a commentlon the placement of stairways in two log houses, 
and a discussion on the nature of artifact collection. 
26 
On the Transmission of Traditional Phenomena: A Message in the Stairs 
This simple note concerns the process of mediation that occurred 
in the building of traditional houses in the Blue River valley of 
Summit County. The houses are ranch dwellings from the turn of the century, 
made of round pine logs, square-notched at the corners, without exterior 
weatherboarding. 
In architecture, as in other realms of cultural expression, certain 
customary ways of arranging and ordering behavior follow the course of 
settlement and regional history. But it is no simple process of uprooting 
and repotting. In the transplantation dynamics, an old living thing often 
modifies and rejuvenates itself in the ecology of a fresh landscape 
that shows a complicated pattern of movement and variation. There is 
simple retention, often visible in obvious traits of surface structure 
and in the neighborly, formal exterior of, say, houses. The alterations 
that develop in new environments or new ethnic configurations are 
often in the deeper structure, the interior and personal spaces. It is 
like that in the case of the traditional Anglo-Ztoerican house 
type scholars call the "I house" when found in our fieldwork in Summit 
County, Colorado. The I house {an essential folk dwelling form consisting 
in plan of a house one room deep, two or more rooms wide, the principal 
entry in the "long side'j^hat aligns parallel to the ridge of the roof) 
has come to be known as the farmer's mansion where recorded and anlyzed 
in the East, South, and Midwestern United States. Geographer Fred Kniffen 
is responsible for its terminology, and Henry Glassie's publications have 
v..wiiiv.j) an uiu 11ving trnng often 
modifies and rejuvenates itself in the crology of a fresh landscape that 
shows a complicated pattern of movement. There is simple retention, often 
visible in obvious traits of surfact structure and in the neighborly, 
27 
made it a familiar part of the repertory of American folk house types. The 
placement of stairs is a secondary feature; it does not define the type. 
The character of the I house when carried into the alpine Colorado 
valley we visited surprised me. That is, some of the details of the house's 
personality here surprised me, like stairway placement. In I houses I have 
studied (especially in the Midwest, the source area for many Colorado 
pioneers), there are hundreds of recorded examples of the type, but most 
have their stairs located "customarily"—near the center of the house, 
and usually at the very core in a central hallway or on a center partition 
wall. Based on the sample documented in 1980, the case differs in Colorado's 
Blue River valley. Here, in these houses which from the outside appear to 
be perfectly "normal" two-room-wide I houses, the stairs are positioned 
not in the middle but off on the edge of the structure. Two examples out 
of a half-dozen we observed in the study area that were recorded intimately 
by Dettmer, Orbach, and me, have stairways placed this way: In the Guyselman- 
Knorr house, the stairs are placed againts the far north wall. They may 
have been relocated (after the house was moved from the Green Mountain 
reservoir project site in the 1940s) from the west wall. In the Dave Doig 
house, the stairs are placed against the west wall. The Doig log house is 
several miles south down the road toward Silverthorne. Both stairways are 
enclosed "boxed-in stairs" in the larger room of the two-room I houses. 
Both dwellings are made of horizontal, round pine logs 8-11 inches in 
diameter and joined by the square-notching method at the corners. The 
corners are locked with 6-inch spikes in diagonal toenailing. The log 
bearing walls are chinked but uncovered and unpainted on the exterior, 
various wallpaperings insulate, cover, and dress up the interior walls. 
28 
Both houses are topped by gable roofs protected by rived shingles. 
There are no room additions, and no front porches. Side or rear 
doors were used in the daily round of comings and goings. They are now 
vacant but in fine condition. Both were intended as permanent, substantial 
family dwellings on growing ranches, and are preeminent examples of Rocky 
Mountain folk housing. 
A simple thing like the placement of stairs, far from being 
incidental or reckless, could be thought of as a result of the provocative 
interaction of people settling into a harsh environment. An old design 
process was situated in a new landscape. The result was modification, 
control, attempts at comfort. Like changing the motifs in a tale, place 
names in a legend, the shape of finials on a chair. At roughly 9,500 
feet, in the cold, snowy vale of the Blue River where winters under the 
Gore Range last nine months, people tinkered with their materials, tools, 
and built environment in order to make a more comfortable and good fit 
with the natural one. So they shoved the stairs over agains the coldest 
outside walls. They then put the brick flue on the interior common wall 
(between downstairs rooms--kitchen and living room) so the same chimney 
could service stoves in both rooms and so the stairway (an enclosed, 
closet-like space for passage only) would not absorb heat radiating out 
from the woodstove in the center of the house. The stairs were furnished 
with doors to further trap the stairwell and prevent heat from being 
sucked up (and wasted) into the upstairs sleeping rooms. 
29 
The simple relocation of the stairs in alpine log I houses is 
a nice instance of how the machine of life, the home, undergoes fine-tuning 
in the course of cultural history. Such glimpses inside the ordinary 
world of tradition and innovation are, to my mind, important parts of 
the regional personality that the Foundation's future museum and 
educational center should conserve, present, and interpret.

The Subject of Artifact Collection: Chiefly about Nail Types 
As essentially material culture fieldworkers, much like members 
of the future research department staff at the future Foundation museum, 
we kept our eyes peeled for important artifacts relevant to the mission. 
We encountered many fine ones. They ranged from the homemade snow ski 
at the McKee ranch to pieces of agricultural equipment left in the back 
a 
rim of^hayfield (beautifully preserved due to the climatic conditions of 
great altitude and low humidity) to entire buildings now vacant and 
seemingly available for collection. But our purpose was not chiefly 
collecting per se, since were were identified as the Library of Congress 
exploration team only. The several artifacts we collected were a miscellany. 
The one feature easily available for collecting was nails, and I made an 
effort to pick up (off the ground, in trash or junk piles, and such likely 
locations) an example of each nail type we determined to be used in the 
construction of different kinds of buildings in the study area. I recorded 
each type, and we scrounged up examples of the types recorded. (See nail 
documentation from fieldnotes, attached.) The nail|;ypes ran the predicted 
gamut of mid- to late nineteenth century sizes and manufactures: 8d common 
cut wire nails up to 6-inch spikes for locking corners of log buildings and 
attaching door and window bucks. 
We invented our own classification system for the few artifacts. We 
further developed a coding system, much like the sort I have used in the 
past and like the system Dettmer learned working in historical archaeology 
at Berkeley. Thus, the code began with the overall project designation, 
C080, then followed with "art." with a number (artifact site number_), and 
32 
a capital letter and numeral. For example, a rived shingle from the 
historic log assayer's office at the site of the gold rush town of 
Tiger (near Breckenridge, Summit County), picked up off the ground nearby, 
appears in code as: C080-art.1-A. And for the second nail we collected 
at the same site (nails being category "C"), it was logged as C080-art.l-C2. 
A nail found on the ground at the McKee ranch (artifact site "2") appears 
as C080-art.2-A. The simple system works. 
The artifacts were placed in ziplock bags, tagged, and placed at 
the Foundation's headquarters near Breckenridge (Farr residente). In all, 
we collected in this miscellaneous fashion 25 artifacts. 21 were nail 
types, forming the basis of a potentially useful nail typology and chronology. 
Nails can become a valuable category, since there is so much confusion 
in the public mind over "historic" or "antique" nails. It is wrongly 
assumed that all square-cut nails are very old and that round common nails 
are new. Both types were used by the mid-nineteenth century (and both types 
prevail today) in the West, and indeed we recorded the existence of both 
types in the same structure dating from first settlement in the 1860s and 
1870s. 
The four artifacts not nails were: that Tiger shingle, two 
illuminating samples of log building chinking made from cattle excrement and 
plant fibers, and the grimy, tattered remnant of an original gold ore 
assayer's sack found in rubble at the Tiger town site. 
Our curiosity about old junk always has its rewards and its perils. 
After I had what folks used to call ^caniption fit" over that homemade 
snow ski the McKee children showed me lying out in the sagebrush pasture, 
I predicted to Dettmer and Orbach that it would experience instant 
33 
revaluation by the family. It did. Here is an intriguing observation: 
at first, we could have tossed the unwanted, junked old ski in the back 
of the Jeep and merrily hauled it off to the Foundation's treasure room. 
But instead, I showed it to the McKees (recent arrivals from Texas with 
no knowledge of traditional alpine ski making), and explained how interesting 
it was to us and how good it would be for Mr. Farr's community museum to 
have stuff like this.... Bingo. They decided to hang on to the ski, 
and placed it gingerly up against the side of the house for all to admire. 
Such are the experiences of the researcher. Such plunder may indeed be 
accumulated, but I considered formalized collecting to be outside our 
job of the moment. We trust John Farr will stop by and make some sort of 
arrangement to obtain the ski. (See attached fieldnote page; ski.) 
Artifact collection is absolutely vital to the life of the Foundation 
and its museum of the future. Farr and I are confident that materials will 
be available and forthcoming. But the announcement that we are "collecting11 
anything in the way of "antiques" and old stuff must wait until the 
Foundation really opens for business. There is as yet no storage or 
curatorial facility or staff. Miscellaneous small artifacts will simply 
be tucked away in ziplocks for the time being. Farr believes that 
ranchers like the Knorr brothers, interested in local history, will be 
helpful in the gathering of all manner of artifacts, from buckrakes to houses. 
Yet oh, how I cherished that ski.

Expenditures for the Two-Week Field Trip, Aug. 1980 
The Folklife Center budgeted $ 2500 - 2800 for the project in fiscal 1980. 
The amount spent, carried into fiscal 1981, was $ 1227.81. 
There are two kinds of expenditures: (1) cash outlay to cover staff 
travel, per diem, miscellaneous expenses, and (2) use of materials 
drawn from Center inventory (film stock, raw tape, office supplies), 
In addition, there were in-kind contributions such as the use of sound 
recording equipment and a camera tripod for copy work. 
Breakdown of paid-out expenditures 
1. Marshall travel in and out (Denver), meals and 
miscellaneous per diem $516.25 
2. Media work-up in Washington (Asman lab; Image lab), for 
developing and contact sheet preparation, duplicate 
slide production, courtesy prints distributed by 
fieldworkers 
3 invoices as of Feb. 1981 (Asman, 2; Image, 1) 611.61 
3. Shipping of recording equipment (air freight) 100.00 
TOTAL $ 1227.81 
Substantial savings came through the contributions from the Foundation at 
the local level in Colorado. Provisions were made for local transportation 
and local lodging for Marshall. Inexpensive arrangements were made for 
the interns to lodge in a vacant summer house near the Farr residence; 
the interns paid the owner $ 10.00 per day rent (12 days each; $240 total 
for use of intern quarters for duration of field trip). 
35 
Materials drawn from office inventory included: 
1. Two boxes reel-to-reel raw tape (24 reels); 12 used. 
2. Two boxes 5" reel-to-reel tape provided for Dettmer's 
Uher recorder; 2 used. 
3. Two boxes cassette tapes for notetaking, backup recording, 
dubbing of original reels for fieldworkers and local 
organization; approx. 50 used. 
4. 50 rolls black-and-white film (Tri-X); 33 rolls used. 
5. 50 rolls color film (Kodachrome 64 plus some Ektachrome 200); 
30 rolls used. With processing mailers (Kodak). 
A reference set of documentary materials will be made available to the 
Foundation, for which reimbursement will be made to the Center. This 
set might include dubs of all field recordings, a set of contact sheets 
for black-and-white photography, a selected set of duplicate color slides, 
and selected courtesy prints. Xerox copies of all fieldnotes, reports, 
and miscellaneous materials will be provided at no charge to the Foundation. 
It is anticipated that substantial use of black-and-white photographs 
will be called for by the Foundation, and the production of a duplicate 
set of negatives is under consideration. A wide array of materials are 
exptected to be employed by the Foundation in various promotional and 
publication programs in the future.

Summary; Recommendations 
This report constitutes the chief vehicle for dissemination of basic 
information about the Colorado project, 1980 component. 
The brief, intensive exploration we accomplished, rattling full-tilt 
through the lower Blue valley in a new appreciation of four-wheel-drive 
Jeeps, was a mere sample of the enormous range of traditional cultural 
materials on these family ranches. It is a region where we may, as 
Dorson would say, cast our net wide and gather in a rich harvest. Our 
work is a beginning. 
The work offers a clear example of how folklorists proceed in research 
problems and ambitions, and thus the "exploratory study" yields its truest 
product. The future of the Foundation and its proved museum rest in part 
on the ability to achieve authentic representations and interpretations of 
alpine life and environment. Fieldwork is the key^nd our modest stint 
in studying tradition's imprint in the environment in this region can 
be thought of as a pilot study, or stalking horse, for further projects. 
Much of the work we do is plainly documentary. The set goal is 
moreover the development of holistic ethnography, the accrual of life 
histories (of artifacts, people, landscapes) that remind me of the grand 
gentlemen, Krohn, Aarne & Thompson and their historic-geographic 
37 
method (so intricately applied to ancient stories by them and applied 
to material culture lately by Glassie) that remains a cornerstone of 
folkloristies. Fine. But there can be little follow-through 
for us as fieldworkers in Colorado; little archetype search or comparative 
analysis is possible since our job of last summer is complete. (The 
three of us intend further research in the region.) The goals of the 
field experiment--of the proposed museum—are mainly diachronic. We want 
perceptions of time, of innovation over the generations in Middle Park in 
all the region's theaters--mining, ranching, engineering, logging, 
tourism, the outdoor life. Synchronic, contemporaneous, communicative, 
structural studies or psychological or stylistic analyses can and should 
follow, after the harvest comes safely in. 
Community and family life in this fascinating natural environment 
are the heart of the project. So, finally, more than some scholar's 
revelations, context is the key to what I would think to be the best 
representation of Rocky Mountain life and work on the land. 
In the Public Eye: The project has maintained a high profile since 
my first consultancy trip and Rotary Club talk in August of 1979. Mr. Farr 
and I planned it that way. The Foundation's creation and their quite 
substantial plans for an outdoor museum of rural and small town life, 
together with a interpretative center with all the trimmings and academic 
quality, is nev/s. I was interviewed over the local radio station, and 
38 
stories ran in both local papers following n\y visits. (Re: attached copy 
of 3 Sept 80 Summit Sentinel story.) It is important in the early stages 
of this gigantic program to spread the word that it is serious business 
with tangible regional impact, that we are getting started in the right 
way, and that everyone's help is welcomed. 
When a master plan is prepared later, it will be printed in 
illustrated brochure form and distributed widely. It will both declare 
philosophy and embrace the business community for appropriate support. 
Recommendations 
The Folklife Center should continue to assist the Rocky Mountain 
Continental Divide Foundation. The Library of Congress connection is vital 
to such organizations as they develop programs, philosophy, and search for 
meaningful, achievable ways to become established educational institutions. 
The Foundation has declared a concern for folk culture. They recognize 
the enormous importance and values of folklife for the proposed outdoor 
museum of alpine life, work, and environment. 
In the future, certain connections will be made to the Colorado Historical 
Society and a variety of preservationsists and professionals on the state 
level. I made inquiries and contacts during the planning stages for the 
1980 project component. These state connections will be pursued by John 
Farr. It is possible that state assistance can be arranged via the 
39 
State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO, Art Townsend, Denver), but I 
should say that the current Interior Department budgetary and reorganization 
processes give us pause. It may well fall again to the locals and the 
federal agency as the prime movers, with the state offices inactive or 
not responsive. I hope welds can be made with the state offices and 
programs, as well as with university people concerned with the sort of preservation, 
researched outdoor museum being conducted and projected. 
If the testimony of the Colorado Foundation is worthy, the 
project was a success. I believe it was indeed successful. The field 
time was too brief. We raced against the clock to get the work done. 
Further field research is now in order, whether as a programmatic 
activity by the Folklife Center or through efforts of the fledgling 
Foundation in Colorado. Farr is determined to press forth with longer 
and extensive research programs of many kinds over thejcoming years. He 
embraces my particular notions of what their museum might be like, and 
agrees that it would be best if a very substantial amount of field 
research and collecting activity could proceed before the Foundation 
declares the museum open for business. Farr thinks of the research phase 
in terms of five or more years, composed mainly of blocks of summer 
work similar to but longer than the 1980 exploratory study. The Foundation 
will need serious continuity and further assistance from the Folklife 
Center, in the provision of consultant services (if appropriate) and 
in the provision of media equipment loans (quite critical). Following 
40 
n\y change of jobs this summer, I will be retained by the Foundation as 
consultant. My base at Kansas State University will allow access to 
Colorado, and I will be able to remain helpful. 
The character of further assistance from the Folklife Center is 
yet to be drawn. My recommendation follows, briefly figured and in 
recognition of available funding and resources: 
(1) Arrange a contract with Barbara Orbach of UCLA for 
six to eight weeks, summer 1981. Her travel in-and-out can be 
provided through a UCLA graduate student fund. Her local 
transportataion and miscellaneous expenses can be provided by the 
Colorado foundation. The Center contract would thus entail a 
fee, plus coverage of lodging and per diem. Her duties would include 
the development of the Foundation research archive (in consultation 
with the Archive of Fclk Song, where she served an internship), her 
personal fieldwork^related to mining, family folklore, other topics), 
community outreach activities, a potential inventory of an important 
artifact collection in Breekenridge, and the preparation of various 
reports and materials. She could arrange UCLA graduate credits. 
(2) Continue in-kind help by the loan of media equipment 
and by the provision of basic media supplies from inventory. 
(3) Arrange with me to serve as consultant and advisor, 
to include time in the area for one to two weeks in early August. 
The vital research date is August 9, the annual reunion day for the 
local high school; the event draws people back to the county, and 
offers opportunities for oral historical research on obsolete 
methods of hardrock mining and other matters.
