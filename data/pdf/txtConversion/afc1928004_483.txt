NYMPHS OF THE NIGHT. 
As sung by TONY PASTOR. 
SomE people take a 
pleasure 
In music or in play, 
And others greatly treasure 
To hear a 
favorite lay ; 
But with my thoughts does tally, 
And give me most delight, 
To watch the " Dames de Ballet," 
The graceful " nymphs of night." 
CHORUS. 
'Ti 
9s pleasant to glance at the marvellous dance 
That is gracing the fanciful stage, 
When the n2,-mplis of the night in the merry gaslight 
Do our fancies so sweetly engage 
Upon the lovely bevy 
My glance it ever falls, 
As I 
my lorgnette levy 
When seated in the stalls ; 
My heart with love is laden, 
My eyes are sparkling bright, 
When looking on each maiden, 
Each charming nymphs of night. 
'Tis pleasant to glance, etc. 
Oh, when the dance is over, 
I 
go behind the scene, 
And act the gallant lover 
To some fair ballet queen ; 
And should I 
ever marry, 
I 
swear I 
will unite 
A 
pretty ' Nell' or " Carrie," 
A 
charming nymph of night. 
'Tis pleasant to glance, etc. 
Our lives shall pass as brightly 
As a 
sunny day in June, 
And at the ballet nightly 
We'll send our honeymoon ; 
And now I 
must be leaving, 
For if I 
mind aright, 
I 
promised that this evening 
I'd meet a " nymph of night." 
'Tis pleasant to glance, etc.

CHORUS. 
0, sorra% the day for Susannah she left ; 
Forget her I'll try if I 
can ; 
But the divil got into her head, so it did, 
When she met with that minstrel man. 
Susannah McManus, sure that was her name, 
And a 
fine dacent grl, be the way, 
Till that nagur minstrel came into the town. 
Bad cess to that very same day ! 
Aleself and Susannala we went to the show, 
Which caused me a 
dollar to spend, 
And Susannah was struck with the fellow that played 
On the tambourine there on the end.

The curtain whit down, .and then it wint up, 
And that very same divil came out, 
With a 
grin and a 
kick, and a 
slap of his fist; 
Like a 
monkey he -wliggied about. 
He straddled a 
chair with a 
quare-looking thing; 
He called it a 
hingc> / think; 
Re sang and looked at Susannah, he did, 
And gave her an old-fashioned wink. 
0, semis the, etc. 
She packed up her duds on the very next day, 
And straightway she whit from her home, 
And she sent me a 
letter and said she was gone 
Wid this minstrel man for to roam. 
I'll gouge him ! 
I'll fight him ! 1.11 kick him ! FD. 
bite him ! 
I'll smash him as flat as a 
pan, 
For taking Susannah McManus away.

THE SUMMER IS DYING. 
By Got, CLAUDE DE HAVEN. 
TETE roses have bloomed for the last time, 
The violets are folded to rest, 
The daisies and butter-cups lying 
Entoinb'd on the pimpernel's breast ; 
The meadow lark's song has abated, 
The robin chirps high on its way 
To the land of the magnolia flowers, 
For the Summer is dying to-day. 
The forest with green blended yellow, 
Is changing its hue to the sere ; 
The orchard with fruit ripe and mellow 
Proclaims 'tis the end of the year, 
When flowers shall bloom in their beauty, 
And birds sing their happiest lay— 
The harvest is all garnered safely, 
For the Summer is dying to-day. 
Dying ! yes, flowers and humanity, 
Fond affections and friends we deemed pure, 
Dead are the feelings of others 
To the sorrows we may endure. 
Happy thought ! bless'd the vision ! 
May we all leave.a mark on our way, 
To that land of the bright Elysium, 
While the Simmer is dying to-day. 
THE GRIP OF FRIENDSHIP'S HAND. 
MOTTO SONG. 
Written, composed, and sung by CHAS. II. 
Duisicax. 
Respectfully dedicated to JAMES DOUGLAS, Esq., Manager Heuck's Opera 
house, Cincinnati. 
SOME people prize great riches, 
Others love a 
flattering tongue, 
But give to me the honest grip 
Of my dear fellow-man. 
'Tis something that is lasting, 
And always will be grand ; 
Then give to me that precious boon, 
A 
grip of friendship's hand. 
CHORUS. 
Here's a 
smile for those who love us 
All over this great land, 
But give to me that precious boon, 
A 
grip of friendship's hand. 
yes, 
Friendship, ' tis said, is but a 
name 
All through this world of strife ; 
Men of you then will make game 
In every walk of life. 
Keep up good pluck, some future time 
They yet will understand 
There's nothing half so pleasant as 
A 
grip of friendship's hand. 
Here's a 
smile, etc. 
Live honest, upright, on the square, 
And at no distant day 
You'll learn that 'tis a 
policy 
That's always sure to pay. 
Be temperate in every act, 
United ever stand, 
And don't refuse your fellow-man 
A 
grip of friendship's hand. 
Here's a 
smile, etc.

I'LL TELL MANIA. 
An original song and chorus by CIIAS. II . 
DITS'CAN. 
TOOK my girl one evening out to ramble in the park, 
Just for a 
little lark, I 
kissed her in the dark, 
She pretended not to like it then, and pouted up her 
Then smiled and said, Oh, Charlie, aint this fun. 
She wore her hair in curls, like other charming girls, 
And thrilled me to, my very finger tips; 
With her head upon my breast. 
Well, " you all know the 
rest." 
It was pleasant, for the little game was even. 
CHORUS. 
But be cautions anti be careful with a 
dainty little miss,. 
Don't ask her for a 
kiss, but take it, she wont miss 
From out her store of plenty, 
let she loudly may scream this : 
" 
Go "way, you naughty man; I'll tell ma'raa—I'll tel 
ma'ma." 
Should you wish a 
girl's affections, do not ever be afraid_ 
To coax the little maid ; the saucy little jade 
May be angry for the moment, yet you'll win her in thce 
end, 
And laugh to think how easy it was done. 
Should she hang her head and pout 
Call you an ugly lout, don't falter, then, for fortune soon 
will send 
,1 bright, forgiving smile ; if you're patient just a 
while, 
Then you'll find the little game is won. 
But be cautions and be careful, etc.

Words and music by CIE°. G. HART. 
COME to me closer, my darling, look once upon me a 
E.T al I ; 
Speak to ine fondly and truly, tell me the cause of your pain; 
Dm I 
speak thoughtless -or chiding, did I your heart ever 
grieve 7 
Don't keep the truth from me hiding—kiss me, and say you'll 
forgive, oh, forgive_ 
No one 'but what have their failings, try to forgive and forget; 
And if you'll love me as ever, life will have charms for me yet; 
Say then again that you love me, never shall change while we 
live ; 
Just once again tell me, darling—kiss we, and say you'll forgive, 
oh, forgive. 
Ali, tell- tale smile, I'm forgiven; now are my troubles all o'er, 
Like Cupid's arrow it's driven thro' to my heart's very core ; 
Smiles breaking from you, my darling, thus ever smile while 
we live; 
Remember to err is but human, so kiss me, and say you'll for-
give, oh, forgive. 
A GIRL AND A BOY'. 
Written by ALICE BATEMAN and BILLY Noca•Lut. 
W E 
are out here before you, a girl and a boy ; 
We're just from old Ireland, the town of Athloy. 
Wherever we go ourselves we enjoy, 
So watch the manceuvres of the girl and the boy. 
We'll show you some pictures not taken from Rome, 
But just as it's done in our own native home. 
The first will be Kathleen and Terence farewell; 
Oh, it was a sad parting, the truth for to tell ! 
SHE. — And I will be Kathleen. 
Ha—And I Terence Arooh. 
BOTH. —And we'll show the kind people the parting 
so true. 
(He sings verse of song.) 
The next will be Emmett, the hero of all; 
In the cause of his country he nobly did fall. 
We 
will show you his parting from his Mary so dear. 
Oh, poor Mary Curran, for you we shed tears. 
SHE.—And I Mary Curran. 
BOTH.—For the loss of poor Emmett the people did 
mourn. 
The next will be Paddy at Donnybrook fair, 
And his own darling Kathleen is sure to be there. 
For the cares of the world we don't care a 
fig, 
So we'll drown all our sorrows in a neat Irish jig. 
(fig and dance of) 
Arrah, Kathleen, you are now going to leave me 
All alone by myself in this place ; 
But I know that you'll never deceive me, 
No, no, while there's truth in your face 
For England's a IK‘antifnl country— 
Such elegant boys—ah, but then, 
You'll not be forgetting your TerencE, 
But come back to old Ireland again.

'Win) rides yonder, prekid and gay, 
Spurning the dust on the King's Highway ? 
Lord of thousand acres wide, 
While I, the beggar, must stand aside ! 
Go thy way !. let me go mine ; 
I 
to beg, and thou to dine : 
Scatter the dust on the King's Highway, 
But room for the beggar, room I 
say. 
Fair and free, night and day, 
Fair and free is the King's Highway ; 
Fair and free, night and day, 
Fair and free is the King's Highway. 
(hug thyself in wealth of state, 
Empty purse has a 
careless gait; 
Thou must watch thy chests and bags, 
None would steal the beggar's rags. 
Wine for thee, for me a 
crust, 
King and beggar, they both are dust ; 
And dust to dust will be borne one day, 
High and low on the King's Highway. 
Fair and free, night and day ; 
Fair and free is the King's Highway. 
Fair and free, night and day ; 
Fair and free is the King's Highway. 
Dainty maid of high degree, 
What has the beggar to do with thee ? 
Thy life is morn, and love is May ; 
What has the beggar to thee to say ? 
Gentle word hast thou for me, 
Tears are in my heart for thee ; 
All, that than should'st fade one day, 
E'en as I, on the great Highway ! 
Fair and free, night and dny ; 
Fair and free is the King's Highway, 
Fair and free, night and day ; 
Fair and free is the King's, the King's Highway.

We hit him in the month and said, 
Oh, how dot was for high ?

I'LL GET RID OF MY MOTHER-IN-LAW. 
Original song and chorus by CHAS. II . 
DUNCAN. 
IF 
you please some time since, I 
married 
A 
young and most beautiful girl, 
But now I 
do wish I 
had tarried, 
For my brain's in a 
terrible whirl ; 
Her mother, alas, is my torment, 
She worries me out of my life, 
My feelings are all in a 
ferment, 
From the trouble I've had with my wife. 
SPOKEN—Yes, I've had more trouble with that wife of 
mine lately than one mortal can stand. 
Every time I 
wish anything done to suit me that old woman always 
sticks in her gab. 
CHORUS. 
But I'll stand inteferenee no more, 
To me she's a 
terrible bore, 
So now, on my life I'll boss my own wife 
And get rid of my mother-in-law. 
I 
ne'er shall forget our first baby, 
A 
bouncing blue-eyed little boy, 
The actions then of the old lady 
Brought me torment instead of great joy ; 
The neighbors all said he's a 
darling, 
The image of his pa, pa, pa. 
The old woman she argued contrary, 
And swore he looked like his ma'ma. 
SPOKEN.—Yes, she said he looked like his /1111'1/11i, and 
I'll be d—well, he didn't look like anything, like her or 
any of her family, but he was a 
Perfect image of his dada. 
So I'll stand inteference no more, etc.

Written by DAVID DILLON, and sung with great success by Jonx SHEN. 
HAN, in the greatest of all Irish sketches, " The Ash Box Inspector." 
Mv name is Owen Slattery, I 
am a 
cobbler by trade; 
By mending your shoes me money I 
made. 
I 
have a 
devil's own wife, I 
wish she was dead ; 
She can sing tralaloo, and she stands on her head. 
It was only last night that me daughter Kate Ann, 
Invited to supper a 
handsome young man. 
When asked his name, he said it was Spoons, 
Recommended by Barnum for juggling spittoons. 
Me fine laddie buck, says I, march out of here, 
Or be the ghost of old Foley, I 
will bite off your ear. 
He made a 
rush for the door, with a 
lump on his skull. 
He thought I 
was Ajax, or else Sitting Bull. 
Me wife, in a 
flutter, seized hold of a 
brick, 
And called me a 
slugger and a 
flannel-mouth Mick. 
"Tearanouns," says I, " Ellen, don't give me a 
guy." 
I 
made a 
short stop on the ball of her eye. 
There's Pat McNamara, from sweet Donegall, 
The ash box inspector, elected last fall ; 
He wears a 
gold watch and chain, and a 
scented bouquet 
I 
wish that the devil inay wid him fly away. 
It wa ,, 
only this morning he sent me a 
card 
To fresco the alley, and whitewash the yard. 
Bad luck to the sucker, if I 
had him here, 
I 
would play seven-up on the edge of his ear. 
THE TW O COLORED WAITERS. 
Compo8ad by HARRY W OODSON. 
Sung by the GUIRAN BROTUEDS. 
OUR names are Jim and Jack Bangun; 
You'll find us always full of fun. 
We're waiters in a 
restaurant, 
And dishes we do sling all day ; 
And at night, when work is over, 
We are gay as bees in clover; 
For two dandy coons like us 
You'll never find so gay. 
If you want a 
good square meal, 
See us turn upon our heel, 
For we de it up in style, 
Singing, dancing all the while. 
CHORUS. 
Oh! here we are, the happy waiters 
See us sling corned beef and taters. 
When we wait uppn the table 
People say we are immense, 
For our style it is so different 
From the others in the restaurant. 
You can get a 
good square meal 
For the sum of fifty cents. 
We have roast beef ; we have corned beef; 
We have pickled eels, and pigs' feet, 
Quail on toast, and chicken stew, 
Or turkey stuffed with good, clean hash ; 
Good mutton chops, with veal cutlets, 
Ham and eggs, with some jiblets, 
Buckwheat cakes, and oyster fry, 
With good potato mash. 
Oh ! here we are, etc.

I'm always happy, gay and free, 
My heart's as light as air ; 
It's brimming o'er with joy and love 
For a 
maiden fair, 
With flashing eyes and teeth like pearl, 
And lips of rosy hue. 
She is, compared with other girls, 
A 
diamond, tried and true ; 
I 
love her, and I've promised her 
Her name I'd never tell. 
I 
will not ; still, I've christened her 
My Darling Isabel. 
My darling Isabel, 
The one I 
love so well, (Sum.) 
The fairest flower that ever grew 
In a

For being sweet, could ne'er compete 
With darling Isabel. 
On Sunday eve, at half-past eight, 
I 
go my love to see, 
Down by the little rustic, gate, 
She's waiting there for me ; 
I 
take her arm, we stroll along 
Where the silvery moonbeams play. 
I3eneath the shade of the greenwood glade, 
My love and T 
do stray. 
I 
love her, and I've pr‘anised her 
Her name I'd never tell.

THE DAY I PLAYED BASE BALL. 
Sun:z, by PAT floosEr. 
Mv name it is O'Halloher, 
I'm a 
man that'.. 
I 
mind my business, stop at home, 
My wants are few an' small, 
Some blackguards ' tother day did come, 
They were full of whiskey, gin and rum, 
An' they took me out in the broilin' sun, 
To play a 
game of ball. 
They made me carry all the bats, 
They nearly drove me crazy, 
An' they sent me out into " centre field," 
But I 
paralyzed them all. 
I 
put up me hands to catch a " fly," 
Holy murther, it struck me in the eye, 
And they hung me on a 
line to dry, 
The day I 
played base ball. 
I 
took the bat an' hit the ball 
I 
thought to San Francisco, 
An' thin around the bases 
Three times I 
ran thera all, 
But thin the gang began to howl, 
An' they said, ould man you made a 
fowl, 
An' they rubbed me down with a 
Turkish towel, 
The day I 
played base ball. 
Two reporters begged to know me name, 
An' presinted me wid a 
medal, 
An' they asked me for me photograph 
To hang upon the wall. 
They said that I 
had won the game, 
Tho' my head was broke and my shoulder lame, 
Au' they sent me home in a 
cattle train, 
The day I 
played base ball.

GOLDEN rays of even sink upon the west, 
Rousing long lost visions from their weary rest ; 
Curfew bells are weaving magic far and nigh, 
Singing holy greetings from the days gone by, 
Singing holy greetings from the days gone by, 
Ev'ry grief and sorrow thus must fade away, 
But affection's treasures will revive and stay ; 
Golden rays of even sink into my heart— 
What I 
love and cherish ne'er from me shall part. 
What I 
love and cherish ne'er from me shall part. 
THE SUMMER OF LIFE. 
Dedicated to EDWARD H ARRIGAN. 
By Joips: ERIGENA BARRETT, Author of "Love and Lqbor." 
0, THE summer of life is a 
joyous time 
When the eye is nudimni'd by care, 
When the bosom responds to each thought sublinn, 
And each propect on earth is fair ; 
When love lights his lamp at each beautiful shrine, 
And whispers we'll never grow old, 
When happiness lingers on lips half divine, 
Whose smiles are more precious than gold. 
CHORUS. 
Then let age do its worst 
In this wide world of strife, 
It can never rob me 
Of the Summer of Life. 
They say friends prove false and that pleasure's a 
sham 
That passes from the touch like a 
dream, 
But while youth is mine I'll be just what I 
am, 
And never endeavor to seem 
A 
slave unto sorrow or whitening hairs : 
Let time march along, I'll be gay ; 
Let those whe enjoy them have troubles and cares, 
But I'll have mirth while I 
may. 
Then let old age do its worst, etc. 
If wrinkles should come then I'll laugh them away ; 
They cannot abide where there's cheer, 
With a 
jolly ha, ha, they never can stay, 
No wrinkles for me while I'm here ; 
But sunshine and laughter and song to the last, 
And some one I 
love for my wife ; 
Then the tempests may howl, the frosts may fall fast, 
I'll bask in the Summer of Life. 
Then let old age do its worst, etc. 
Sung with great success at the New Chicago Theatre, by CUARLES H. 
D 
UNCAN. 
I'vE an object in view I 
would like to reveal, 
About a 
poor workingman tempted to steal, 
Whose children at home they were starving for food; 
The poor things were freezing; there was no coal nor 
wood. 
Alas ! be it said sweet charity was dead ; 
The friend of the poor to another world had sped. 
This poor workingman he had nothing in store, 
And a 
cry came from heaven, " Give aid to the poor!" 
Alexander T. Stewart, the great New York millionaire, 
Departed this life for another world's care. 
It would not have hurt him I'm certain and sure 
To have left a 
few thousands to help feed the poor, 
He invested, I'm told, in a 
great institute. 
In a 
matter of business " you bet" he was cute. 
He was not like Jim Fisk, nor will be many more, 
With his lightning express giving aid to the poor. 
My object, dear friends, is to ask yon to share 
With the poor and the needy wherever you are. 
Remember that poverty is never a 
crime ; 
Good clothes often cover a 
heart filled with slime. 
Don't forget your dear mother wherever you roam, 
Nor the dear darling loved ones she tends well at home. 
Oh ! don't let a 
hungry man go past your door, 
And God will reward giving aid to the poor.

EVANGELINE. 
An original Song and Dance, performed with immense success by the 
DALY BROTHERS. 
Written by THOMAS DALY. 
In the summer when the birds begin to sing, 
And the pretty notes from their yellow throats 
Make the valley and the woodland ring, 
Down by a 
little running stream, 
In a 
neat white cot, down in a 
shady dell, 
There lives a 
fairy queen; 
She is the fairest maid there is beneath the sun, 
Is my Evangeline. 
CHORUS. 
In the summer when the birds begin to sing, 
And the pretty notes from their yellow throats 
Make the valley and the woodland ring, 
I'll wed my sweet Evangeline. 
Now of all the sweetest creatures in the land, 
Ever the sweetest one, yes, the dearest one; 
And I'll happy be whene'er I 
gain the hand 
Of my pretty sweet Evangeline. 
For she is such a 
belle, and always looks so well, 
And mine she'll surely be; 
I'm as happy as a 
king, or a 
bird upon the wing, 
And I 
sing and dance with glee. 
In the summer, et*.

And with love for her my heart is heavy-laden. 
The last time that I 
saw my love, 
She promised me to wed, 
Oh, she's so sweet, and so complete, 
She's turned this darkey's head.

She possesses every art of fascination. 
She loves no one but me, and mine some day she'll be, 
I'll be happy when the wedding day is o'er, 
Then when I 
can call her wife, we shall lead a 
merry life, 
In joy and bliss, ecstatic evermore.

CEASE thy weeping, sadden'd heart, 
Brighter days are on the way, 
And the clouds so dear and dark, 
All will surely pass away. 
Flow'rs of spring will come again, 
Blooming sweetly o'er the lea, 
And the warblers of the grove 
Songs of love will chant for thee.

Drive away all idle fears, 
Let those clouds of grief and care

has thy friend in death been laid

Has thy loved one prov'd untrue, 
has he broken every vow

Weep not for him, gentle maid, 
He who would both woo and win, 
Then turn traitor to his word, 
Deep has drank of darker sins.

From my Coney Island girl. 
When we landed at the isle 
She quickly took my arm ; 
We chatted and talked as on we walked 
Toward the crowded beach. 
I 
asked her if she'd bathe. 
She smiled, and said, " of course." 
She looked so cute in a 
blue flannel suit 
I 
stuck to her like a 
leech. 
She sung so, etc. 
We battled with the surf, 
Then played with the water ; 
She grabbed the rope and tried to float, 
But got ducked for her pains.

When a 
tall man stood before us. 
He called her wife, upon my life, 
And spoiled our little game.

Now the other day a 
loafer on the corner, 
Come up and asked me if I 
was alive, 
And with a 
club he hit me on the shoulder, 
And for the nearest store I 
made a 
dive. 
The man that owned the store he chased me quickly, 
And with his fist lie hit me in the eye, 
Then I 
told him for to nemt, a, missamitshinna, 
And at the dirty loafer; I

THE GOOSE WITH THE GOLDEN EGG.

To me quite a 
snug little suns

And remember you've reached twenty-one."

'How they hastened to borrow or beg ; 
For I

"

To my utmost surprise I 
attracted all eyes, 
And people inquired my name, 
Who a 
few months before, pronouneed me a 
bore, 
And of my dress and may features made game. 
They'd laugh when I'd joke, with me dine, drink, or 
snnike, 
To my face they were dumb as a 
keg ; 
But when I'd turn my back, how they'd laugh and they'd 
clack, 
At the goose with the golden egg. 
The girls nil so fair, admired my hair, 
It was : odium 
before it was red ; 
They spoke of my style, drooped their eyes when I'd 
smile, 
And mammas marked me fit to be wed. 
Their daughters they sighed, and some th ei

I 
was loved by Jane , 'Martha and Meg ; 
My presents they took, and they all tried to hook— 
The poor goose with the golden egg. 
But a 
day came at last. I'd been living too fast, 
Run in debt and my money all flown ; 
Where'or I 
w(uild call, they'd It me wait in the hall,

They'd giggle and jeer.

Now my subjeet of rhyme may just be in time, 
For the world I

would say—I

I 
met a 
fair charmer a 
few weeks age, 
In a 
lladison Avenue stage, 
Her style and her figure it pleased me, you know, 
She was just about the right age. 
As 
we were alone, I 
suggested to her 
in terms quite polite and refined, 
That I'd be most happy to see her safe home, 
She said yes, if you'll be so kind. 
SPOKEN.—So 
I 
took the young lady to her home, she invited 
Inc in, and I 
spent a 
very pleasant evening, and just before I 
left 
Ctiont-s, 
tickled her under the chin, 
Repeat—I 
tickled again and again. 
She did not say no, she liked it, you know, 
When I 
tickled her under the chin. 
called by appointment to see her next day, 
And asked her if she'd take a 
drive, 
She said 
delighted, that's just what I 
want, 
And in a 
moment was close by my side. 
Now driving, you know, makes your appetite keen, 
So when we got back, to Delmonico's we went, 
And I 
ordered same oysters and wine. 
SPOKEN.— Yes, we had a 
delightful supper together, and after 
supper, when the wine commenced to make her cheeks rosy, I 
reached across the table, and I

tickled her under the chin, etc.

Now I 
see her quite often, and you won't be surprised 
That our friendship ripened so fast, 
For I 
found that in Ler, I 
rcany had n.ct 
A dear, darling creature at 1:st. 
And our love grows stronger, day after day, 
We're going to be married next June, 
And it all came, through that queer little way, 
That I 
tickled her under the chin. 
SPOKEN.—S0 
last night when she bid me good- by at the front 
door, she said Charley, you dear good fellow, I'll never forget 
the first time that you— 
Tickled me under the chin, 
That you tickled me under the chin, 
I 
didn't say no. for I 
liked it you know, 
When you tickled me under the chin, 
When I 
tickle her under the chin, 
I 
tickled again and again, 
She did not say no, for she liked it, you know, 
When I 
tickled her under the chin. 
SPOKEN.—This is the moral of' the story: 
You all have a 
chance for adventures like this, 
1Vith the charming young ladies you meet, 
And you'll find on an average that five out of tort 
Won't object to a 
drive and a

But pray let me give you one piece of advice,

MONEY WILL ALWAYS FIND FRIENDS. 
Sung with great success all over the etintry by IIAnnY 
ONTAl, UR. 
Though sad the appearance I 
make to you now, 
Well up I 
have been in my time; 
But stony and cold has the world been of late, 
And poverty still seems a 
crime. 
I 
have found out with bitter experience this: 
Without money you soon will decay, 
And those who you thought you could count as your friends, 
When wanted wire always away. 
If poor you will find it a 
terrible crime, 
For poverty often offends ; 
But if you are wealthy, how different then— 
For money will always find friends. 
When I 
kept a 
fine house and parties could give 
In a 
style that's been seldom before, 
Friends I 
could find in plenty, of course: 
Their numbers I 
could count by the score. 
But now if I 
meet them and ask them for help, 
With a 
shrug of the shoulder they say. 
" 
Excuse me just now ; 
see you again !" 
And nodding they shuffle away. 
If poor, you will find, etc. 
Perhaps the dark cloud that's been hanging o'crhead 
Will fade, and its place become bright; 
And fortune, though fickle, will smile once again 
On this nmt deplorable wig,ht. 
And if but again I 
have wealth at command, 
I'll pay back to those with a 
frown 
Who ought to have helped a 
friend when in need, 
And not kicked him because he was down. 
If poor, you will find, etc. 
THE SONGS MY MOTHER USED TO SING. 
Sung by SAX. DEVERE. 
TIM songs my mother used to sing, 
Could I 
but hear them once again. 
To childhood's memories still they cling, 
They soothed my every ache and pain. 
Oh ! how sweet they used to seem, 
How they made my heart rejoice ; 
Years, long years seem but a 
dream, 
Still I 
hear my mother's voice. 
CHORUS. 
Childhood's days to me so dear, 
Sweetest recollections cling ; 
How I 
often long to hear 
The songs my mother used to sing. 
Those sweet and simple little songs, 
Songs I 
love so well to hear ; 
How they'd heal my childish wrongs, 
How they'd seem to please and cheer. 
Songs in memory buried deep, 
Songs that oft put me to rest, 
Songs that closed my eyes in sleep, 
Lying on my mother's breast. 
Childhood's days to me, etc. 
Every simple little strain, 
Calls to mind some happy scene, 
Brings up childhood's days again, 
Days to me yet fresh and green ; 
Better to me than glittering gold, 
Greater by far than crown of king 
Dearer to me than all the world, 
Are the songs my mother used to sing. 
Childhood's days to me, etc,

IINuErt the arch in the park, 
We were delightfully dreaming, 
Sweet was the song of the lark, 
Sunbeams around us are streaming ; 
He sat with his hand clasped in mine, 
My heart how I 
longed to unmask it, 
Glad to havo said " it is thine." 
Had he the courage to ask it. 
CHORUS. 
Birds of the air, joyous and fair, 
Singing from dawn until dark ; 
Were you asleep, or did you just peep 
Under the arch in the park ? 
-Under the arch in the park, 
Shadows around us were falling, 
Hushed was the song of the lark, 
Only the night- birds were calling ; 
He whispered in tenderest strains, 
But his love, ah ! he dared not reveal it, 
A 
kiss would have soothed all his pains— 
Had he the courage to steal it. 
Birds of the air, etc. 
Under the arch in the park, 
Moonlight around us was shining. 
He timidly made the remark : 
" 
Oh ! for a 
heart I 
am pinityr. 
You might give me yours, love," lie said, 
" 
I 
promise you never to break it." 
I 
blushed and I 
hung dDwn my head— 
Then he mustered up courage to take it.

And all the money that they steal, why, I 
can spend it all.

Perchance some of them will dare, 
To breathe my name to thee.

TIE MAN FROM ST. 
LOUIS. 
An original song, by Cons. II. DUNCAN. 
Sung to immense applause, at 
the New Chicago Theatre. 
I'LL sing to you of a 
strange old man, 
I 
met one stormy night ; 
He was musing on his country's ills, 
And gave nie an awful fright. 
He spoke to me of an iron bridge, 
That cross'd the Mississippi river ; 
It was a 
horrible tale, indeed, 
And fairly froze my liver. 
He said Chicago had lost her grip, 
And soon would be bankrupt, 
Because her city officials were 
So awfully corrupt. 
He said there was coming a 
financial crash, 
That surely would pierce through us. 
Said I, for God's sake who are you ? 
Said he, I'm from St. Louis. 
He bragg'd to me of their commerce grant 
_And assured me on his word, 
The Mississippi jetties would soon be fixe,2„ 
Then Chicago would be floor'd. 
He made remarks on our filthy streets, 
But spoke not of his own, 
Nor of their women's terrible feet, 
Nor where they had been grown. 
THE MAN FROM ST. LOUIS.—Concluded. 
He spoke to me of their tunnel grand, 
That wound round under the streets, 
But spoke not of the awful deaths 
There many a 
creature meets. 
I 
look'd into his pitiless face, 
And thought what ill-wind blew us, 
This man possess'd of a 
terrible gall, 
Who said he came from St. Louis. 
Now should you meet him on his rounds, 
You'll know his ugly mug, 
And that terrible big proboscis, 
That borders on a 
pug. 
His feet are long and slim, 
With bunions on the sides, 
He shuffles along as though half dead, 
When he should make big strides. 
He's knock-knee'd and bow-legged too, 
let thinks himself quite pretty ; 
He says he is the ladies' pet 
When in his native city. 
While walking with my steady girl, 
lie step'd up and swore he knew us 
Alas, that I 
should ever have met 
This terrible man from St. Louis.

THE rich complain at Fortune's frown, 
The poor grow poorer still ; 
The spendthrift saves his pennies now 
To pay his lodging bill ; 
The miser counts his secret store, 
his greed he can't restrain ; 
He hopes to save a 
trifle more 
When the good times come again. 
Then keep your spirits light and gay, 
And sing this hopeful strain, 
We'll all be happy by-and-by, 
When the good times come again. 
The man of toil is now at rest, 
his rent is coming due ; 
His purse is empty, but his heart 
Is honest, proud, and true ; 
lie smiles at each succeeding cross, 
And does not sigh in vain ; 
He knows the tide of life will change 
When the good tunes come again 
Then keep your spirits, etc. 
The child sits on her father's knee, 
Her kiss he can't refuse ; 
"Just see my little toe, papa, 
I 
want a 
pair of shoes." 
Too well he knows her slialitest want. 
But now she asks in vain; 
All he can say is, " Yes, my dear, 
When the good timPs come ao- ain," 
Then keep your spirits, etc. 
The lover looks with wistful eyes 
Upon Ids bride to he ; 
S 
ie begs him to be good and wise, 
Till brighter days they see ; 
Tney kiss and part, while in each heart 
Sweet hopes of joy remain ; 
Some day they'll wed, but they must wait 
Till the good times come again. 
Then keep your spirits, etc,

Wait till the moonlight falls on the water,

at INIrrcir. 
Theatre Cornique, St. ',oak. 
SomE time ago they gave a 
show, 
That caused sensation groat— 
In Gotham's Grand Fifth Avenue, 
It's sights I 
will relate. 
There mothers sighed, while babies cried, 
Yet not a 
tear did flow ; 
The kids would whine most all the time, 
Up at the Baby Show. 
CHORUS. 
Such a 
squalling, such a 
bawling, 
They set up around that floor, 
Pa, pa, pa ! ma, ma, ma ! 
They continually did roar. 
Some had two, some had three, 
How they do it I 
don't know ; 
It was a 
curious sight indeed, 
The New York Baby Show. 
As you walked along with the buzzing throng, 
Quite frequent you would hear, 
You little darling," " tootsy wootsy," 
" 
Please let me hold the dear." 
" 
Aint she nice," " you pearl of price," 
All sitting in a 
row ; 
They'd rub the thumb against the gum, 
Up at the Baby Show. 
Such a 
squalling, etc. 
Another day I 
chanced that way, 
Inspected the cherubs well ; 
One took my eye as passing bv, 
Oh couldn't she pout and yell, 
Up ill my arms, admired its charms, 
You ve all been there I 
know, 
Upon my vest—you know the rest, 
Up at the Baby Show. 
Such a 
squalling, etc.

FEARFULLY AND WONDERFULLY MADE. 
BANJO SOLO.

Written and composed by SAM D EVELE. 
DECEPTION just now is the rule tzll around, 
It's practiced in all shades of life ; 
Just mind what I 
say, mid be careful, my friends, 
-When the time comes to pick out a 
wife. 
Her eyes may be loving, her smile may be sweet, 
When you approach her she's timid and afraid ; 
Be careful, look well before making the leap, 
Yon don't know how the dear girl is made, 
In the good days of old, in our grand-mothers' time, 
Girls didn't enamel or paint ; 
Didn't wear palpitators their bosoms to swell, 
Didn't lace themselves up till they'd faint ; 
Didn't wear paten:.; calves, or use bloom of youth, 
And the rose in their cheecks didn't fade. 
You must know a 
girl well now before you get stuck, 
For she's fearfully and wonderfully made. 
Girls long ago didn't pencil their brows, 
"Use lotions to make the chin fair ; 
The girls long ago combed the hair on their heads, 
Ni' it's combed on the lock of a 
chair. 
I've got inure to tell when I 
see von alone, 
I 
have said too much here I'm afraid. 
But before you get married, examine them well, 
For they're fearfully and wonderfully made.

I 
AM a gay laboring man, 
And I 
have a 
beautaful daughter, 
'Who never did care mach for work, 
It's her mother's own wish . that she aughter; 
It seems that she fancied the stage, 
So I 
granted her final request, 
And now she's a 
beautiful dancer, 
And ranks along with the best, 
On the stage she is -Madame La Shortie, 
But her right name is Biddy _McCarty ; 
:She brings home at night, and at matinees, 
Largo baskets of flowers, and also bouquet, 
'Oh, she is my only daughter, 
And I 
am the malt that taught her 
'To wear spangled clothes, and go round on her toes, 
And there is no such a 
girl as Biddy. 
When salary day- does arrive. 
All trouble and toil it does smother, 
Tor, just the day before, that there was a 
hick, 
The girl had been scolded by her mother .: 
She's courting a 
clerk in the bank, 
Who sees her safe home at the door, 
And pays a 
big gang in the gallery. 
To applaud in a 
perfect uproar. 
On the stage, eito

ROLLING ON THE GRASS. 
To those who live in cities, 
Where but bricks and mortar's seen, 
There's nothing so refreshing 
As " a 
little bit of green ! " 
So often on a 
summer's day, 
An idle hour to pass, 
011 to the fields I'd get away, 
And roll about the grass. 
CHORUS. 
Rolling on the grass, 
-Mongst the buttercups and daisies, 
That's the way, that's the way, 
An idle hour to pass ; 
Rolling on the grass, 
'Mongst the buttercups and daisies, 
Fancying you're a 
child again, 
Rolling on the grass. 
The prettiest of carpet ' tis, 
That ever couLl be found, 
With daisies sprinkled here and there, 
And May bushes' around ; 
A 
bright blue roof above, o'er which 
The silver clouds sail by, 
And skylarks think it but a 
lark, 
To sing up in the sky. 
CHORT.74, 
While you're rolling on the grass, 
'Mongst the buttercups and daisic, 
That's the way, that's the way, 
An idle hour to pass, 
Rolling on the grass, 
'Mongst the buttercups and daisies, 
Fancying you're a 
child again, 
Rolling on the grass.

ROLLING ON THE GRASS.—Concluded., 
One day, whilst I 
reclining was, 
And half inclined to dream, 
I 
suddenly was startled by 
A 
female's piercing scream; 
Towards me rushed a 
pretty girl, 
In fearful state of mind, 
And followed by a 
frantic cow, 
Unpleasantly behind. 
SPOKEN.—Of 
course to spring- to my feet and catch the 
fainting maiden in my arms was but the work of a 
quarter of a 
second ; the cow on seeing my defiant atti-
tude came to a 
full stop, and stared ; I 
said, waving my 
hat commandingly, ' Go away, cow—go away directly !" 
and so she did, and sent us both  
CHORUS. 
Rolling on the grass, 
'Mongst, the buttercups and daisies, 
That's the way, that's the way, 
That awful cow did pass ; 
Rolling on the grass, 
'Mol4.r,st the buttercups and daisies, 
Fancying you're a 
child again, 
Rolling on the grass. 
I 
often met her after that, 
And this was my excuse, 
That should ' a 
frantic cow ' turn up, 
1 
perhaps might be of use ; 
She's going to change her name for mine, 
'When a 
few short weeks shall pass, 
And so I 
bless that blessed cow, 
And rolling on the grass.

SOMETHING TIIAT OUGHT TO BE DONE,' 
MOTTO SeNG, 
Sirmz by FRANK LEWIS W I
;11 great m2c.ctsa. 
Tins world is ad-I:aiming each moment anti hour, 
And atarthug impro-i-einenig are made, 
Each nation is striving to gain greater power,. 
All others to throw in the shade ; 
And eacli individual struggles along, 
for he knows that when life is begun, 
To gain great distinction he really must try 
To do something that's never been done. 
This city has many attractions, I 
OWIl, 
But still there is something amiss ; 
The streets and the parks should be kept neat and clean, 
-My idea for improvement is this : 
There are plenty of good honest men out of work, 
With hunger and debt overrun, 
1:11-y are willing to toil, let us give them the ehanee, 
Ti. 
s4mt,,thing that ought to be done. 
ctftna try is burdened with debt and distress., 
its people are suffering, too ; 
Jir finances are in a 
terrible mess, 
And the prospect at present looks blue ; 
There is only one way to prosperity now, 
For corruption has had a 
long run, 
We should have the right man at the head of our land, 
It is something that ought to be done.

TITLES.

Written by IIAflr.Y BzxsETT, the Rotterdam Comedian. 
THERE are many curious titles 
For the ballads of the day, 
Such as ' Kiss me once, dear mother," 
" 
Little Tommy's gone astray ;" 
But I've found some new and sparkling, 
Which I'll warble while I'm here, 
They are full of grief and pathos, 
And may draw a 
silent tear. 
CHORUS. 
Now prepare to hear my card, 
It will cause your hearts to throb ; 
I 
will chirrup slowly, softly— 
Do not be ashamed to sob. 
Papa's chest-prof cetor's faded, 
Throwing freckles at t 
he breeze. 
He had seltzer on his ulster, 
Let me sniff the fragrant cheese ; 
Little Willie's tombstone's mortgaged, 
Sister's gum is in the hash, 
He had pimples on his duster, 
Let me hear the lightning flash. 
Now prepare, etc. 
There's a 
prize in every doughnut, 
Come and lean upon the ice, 
Do not waltz on Eva's chignon, 
Throwing turkeys for the dice ; 
Papa's hair is getting mouldy, 
When dew is on the lake, 
Give my last year's clothes to brother. 
When I'm chilly let me shake. 
Now prepare, etc. 
Who has spit in auntie's slipper ? 
Darling Kitty's hair's decayed, 
Let me hear that sweet hand- organ, 
Coaxing sunshine in the shade ; 
When I'm bathing in the treetops, 
Sprinkling ginger on the sea, 
Papa will you leave off boozing ? 
Save one little club for me. 
w 
prepare, 
Let me die among the oysters, 
There are sears upon his hair, 
Writing monograms in lager, 
Do not harm the grizzly 1.).:ar ; 
What is home without a 
doorknob ? 
'When thy nose begins to blush, 
Soothing liwdbugs in the moonlight, 
Bury me beneath the slush. 
Now prepare, etc.

That was all the world to me.

You could milk her in the morning, 
And could milk her in the night ; 
And the milk that she would give you 
Would never make you tight.

Was as fine as any silk ; 
And, signs upon the cow,

And I

OnI one evening lately, I 
dressed up 
I 
put on my Sunday clothes, plug hat and all, 
And I 
started proudly, while whistling loudly, 
For Neal Brogan's raffle at Hibernian Hall. 
Going round a 
corner a 
gang of rowdies— 
Oh ! I 
know they're rowdies, for they never work— 
Says, let us give this old Tad a 
racket, 
We will have a 
picnic, boys, and. toss the Turk. 
CHORUS. 
Now I'm not a 
fighter, nor yet a 
biter, 
But when duty calls I 
never shirk ; 
So I 
tell you plainly, tho' I 
look ungainly, 
That they had no picnic when they toss'd the Turk. 
Oh ! the big ringleader, a 
free lunch raider, 
Says, " O'Brien, you had better paint the ' tile,' 
Put crape around it, get an axe and pound it !" 
And he thought ' twits funny when the gang did smile. 
It was then my dander rose like a 
gander, 
For I 
heard one loafer say he'd flash a 
dirk ; 
So I 
tapp'd him lightly, and surprised him quitely, 
And they had no picnic when they toss'd the Turk. 
Now I'm not a 
fighter, etc. 
Oh ! they gather'd round me, and thought to pound me. 
But I 
put my back against a 
big brick wall ; 
" 
ion can't go behind me," says I, " now mind me, 
If ye stand forninst me I 
can bate ye all." 
Then the gang did face me, and thought to lace me, 
But I 
show'd them tricks I 
learned at Donegal ; 
Right and left I 
pounded, they were dumbfounded, 
And at last for morcy they began to bawl. 
SPoEEN.--Well, they looked surprised, and Redheaded 
Mike says, " Who are you ?" " Well," says I, " my name 
is Cornelius Thomas Francis Meagher O'Brien, and more-
over—" 
I'm not a 
fighter, etc.

THE DINNER BELL. 
Parely on " The Water Mill." 
By BEN COLLINS expressly far HALEY and WEST. 
LISTEN to the Dinner Bell; 
At 12 o'clock each day 
How the boarders shout " Hurrah," 
To the dining room hurry away. 
The proprieter looks so pale and sick 
As they all sit down to eat, 
And though looking yet he cannot tell 
-Which one his board will beat. 
Here, pass that " Union butter," 
One of them boarders said. 
If the mill can never grind 
We don't get any bread. 
What a 
hardened hungry lot 
Thi'so boarders seem to be, 
I 
low they grasp and gormandize 
Most everything. they see ; 
They were never known to stop, 
Euless they had their fill, 
Often coming back again 
To that corn- beef mill ; 
Truly speaks the landlord, 
" 
My clothes are fading fast; 
I 
cannot wash my -Ulster 
In the water fhit haq past." 
t 
1 
" 
Take this lesson to yourselves, 
But don't take anything more ; 
Pay your board, leave my house, 
Or I'll fire you out the door. 
You want your trunk, I 
want my money, 
I've trusted you enough. ; 
I 
know you well, you can't fool me, 
And say my turkey's tough ; 
Go to the Black Hills and dig for Indians ; 
You may come back in silk ; 
But the mill can never grind 
With the water that's in milk," 
Oh what waste in a 
boarding house, 
What bills you have to pay ; 
A 
dead-beat will come back again, 
'Ca use lie " couldn't stay away.'" 
Sonic will ask for a 
fire escape, 
And more an elevator, 
And want their dollar diamond rings 
Put in the refrigerator. 
Take this lesson to your hearts 
Before you bring in your trunk ; 
The coffee mill can never grind 
When the cook is on a 
drunk.

"Little Robin. tell Kitty I'm coming." 
DARLING Kitty, where can you be roaming ? 
I've sought for my fairy all day ; 
She promised, last night, in the gloaming, 
That down by the mill stream she'd stray. 
Oh, sweet are the smiles of the roses 
That greet me in valley and dell ; 
In her face all beauty reposes,— 
My Kitty's who loves me so well. 
Tom. Oh, she is the pink of country lasses, and I 
am 
afraid I 
have lost my heart ! I 
never can stop thinking 
of her bright eyes. 
They are brighter and fairer than a 
thousand concentrated dew- drops. We met all by chance, 
of course. 
I 
was ruralizing here, and one lovely day last 
week we met,— 
`• Down by the old Mill Stream." 
Down by the old mill stream, 
There many happy hours we dream ;

Sweet the promise that he gave me, 
When we met not long ago ; 
Men, they say, are all deceivers, 
But he'll keep his word, I 
know. 
Kirrv. It's past the hour, yet he is not here. I 
wonder 
where lie can be ? 
Not that I'm a

Dear me ! 
It's so provoking ! 
There, 
have been wan-

yet he keeps out of the way.

can't forget the boar 
when first we met. 
I 
was taking a

it's very cruel— 
Now here fin seventeen, 
And have not got a

There's lots of charming fellows, 
Who smile and flirt with me ; 
But mamma says, when older, 
'Tis time enough, you see !

Without Papa, you know,

While other girls they stay, 
And with some charming fellow

I'm growing quite discouraged,

Kept shut up like a

Take whiskey, brandy, if you choose, 
No pleasure in the draught I 
see ; 
But, oh, to drive away the blues 
It's Piper Heidsieck, boys, for me ! 
It makes you MIT pain forget, 
It makes the darkest day so bright; 
The only draught I've seen as yet 
To tempt a

Tho' cocktails are the style at morn 
When heads are dizzy, very queer.

POOR ORPHAN BOYS. 
An original STA .; 
and Chorus. by CHAS. II. 
DuNCAN. 
As yon walk through the street strange faces you meet 
On every hand pas;-iing along, 
Son e 
laughing with glee, while others you see 
Look lost in the troubk-soine throng,. 
The poor and distress'd —the Hell and well dress'd— 
Pass on in their sorrows and joys, 
Yet I 
beg you'll give heed to those whom in need 
You find to be poor orphan boys, 
CHORES. 
Oh ! remember, my friends, as this life it soon ends, 
With all of its sorrows and joys, 
'Tis best you give heed to those whom in need 
You may find to be poor orphan boys. 
There is many a 
lad who has gone to the bad 
From neglect and bad training alone— 
Been lost in the whirl of this great, wicked world, 
And forced among strangers to roam ; 
Then, tempted to steal for the want of a 
meal, 
He is caught in the act, sent to jail, 
With not even a 
friend his excuse to defend 
Or E 
ke heed to his pitiful tale. 
Oh ! remember, etc. 
Should you meet a 
boy whom vice would destroy 
Lift him up with a 
will if you can, 
You'll find ill good time up the ladder he'll climb, 
And soon be a 
prosperous man ; 
Then, some future day he will surely repay 
Your hindness to him when a 
lad, 
And you'll learn in the end that misfortune did send 
The best friend that you over had. 
Oh ! remember, ete.

W HY are you silent and sad, love,

Lives young as yours should be glad, love, 
Smile on me sweetly again.

Speak to me then, only speak, love, 
Why are those tears on thy cheek 
Give me the answer I 
seek, love, 
Speak to me, love, only speak. 
Why are you sorrowing here, love, 
When I 
am close by your side ? 
Swiftly the day draweth near, love, 
Soon I 
shall claim you my bride. 
What have I 
done to deceive thee ? 
This is the answer I 
seek, 
What were the words that could grieve the,o ? 
Speak to me, love, only speak, oh. 
Speak to me then, etc. 
Hearts like your own cannot live, love, 
Always in sorrow and pain ; 
Whi -
iper yon gladly forgive, love,

Cease all Ely weary repining, 
Banish the tears from thy cheek ; 
With my arms round you entwining,

LAST week my wife said : " Arthur dear, 
I 
should so like a 
change, 
It's rather dull for me at home, 
Now couldn't you arrange, 
To meet me after business hours, 
And then you know we might, 
Just have a 
little dinner, dear, 
And go somewhere at night ?" 
SPOKEN.—Why, certainly, my popsey wopsey, we will. 
So, meeting with my old friend Brown, he being a 
very 
jolly fellow, advised me to take her to see Pink Dominoes, 
'twill make you roar! It did, with rage! for ever since 
he has done nothing but sing— 
CHORUS. 
Oh, Pink Dominoes, you've settled me for life, 
And why did I 
not see you first before I 
took my wife ? 
She says she's found me out, and in my face she throws 
All the naughty things they do in Pink Dominoes 1 
He thought he look'd a 
guilty wretch, 
While everybody roar'd, 
He chew'd his programme into pulp, 
He felt so very bored ; 
His wife she sat like all the rest, 
Laughing at the fun, 
Says she, " How could you bring me here, 
To show me how ' tis done ?" 
SPOKEN.—So, that's the way you deceive your poor wife, 
is it ? sending false telegrams, and false letters, like that 
wicked fellow in the play ! and ever since he has been 
singing— 
Oh, Pink Dominoes, etc. 
Now should that author cross my path, 
I'll make him use his pen, 
To write a 
big apology, 
To all the married men ; 
And as for Brown, the horrid wretch, 
The cause of all my woes, 
I 
will be sure to pay him out, 
And give him awful blows ! 
SPOKEN.—NO, I 
won't, I'll buy two orchestra tickets, 
and send them to his wife, then perhaps he will have oc-
casion to sing— 
Oh, Pink Dominoes, etc.

You will miss me, darling Chloe, when I 
sleep beneath the 
sod, 
Where the summer winds are murm'ring o'er the lea ; 
You will think of me in kindness, as life's weary road you 
plod, 
When my spirit rests from pain and sorrow free ; 
The sands of life are slowly ebbing, darling, with the tide, 
And soon these bones will mingle with the clay ; 
In the winter of your sorrow you will think of how I 
died, 
And you'll miss me, Chloe, when I'm laid away. 
CHORUS. 
For old uncle Tom is feeble, 
And his head is bending low ; 
Master calls, he can no longer stay— 
For his limbs are getting weary 
And his eyes are growing dim, 
But you'll miss me, Chloe, when I'm laid away ! 
You will tell our little children that their father dwells 
above; 
How the angels led him up the golden stair, 
You will tell them how I 
lov'd them, with a 
fond and 
sacred love ; 
They must try to meet their poor old father there. 
And when the Judge his trumpet sounds from realms of 
bliss on high, 
And the morning of the great day comes at last, 
I 
will meet you, darling, Chloe, and together you and I, 
Will no longer dread December's wintry blast. 
For old uncle Tom, etc.

And sadly meditate,. 
Gently sigh, We all must die, 
Like' the fire in. the grate. 
One bitter night in winter, 
The snow fell fast and wild ; 
A 
girl looked in the window— 
A 
careworn, hapless child : 
Then grandpa whispered, " 1W)y," 
And toddled 
the gzitc-, 
To save from sin he brought her in, 
Near the tire in the grate. 
So let the 
room be cheerful, 
Keep the fire burning-, 
'Tis charity's bright flame, 
Reminding of the evening 
The orphan Mary came, 
So ragged, cold, and hungry, 
With grandpa from the gate ; 
For him she kneels, a 
pray'r she yields. 
Near the fire in the grate.

IN 
a cosy little cabin down in Georgia, 
Where the cotton flowers blossom fair and white, 
There dwells a 
lovely little girl 
Who is my heart's delight, 
And at night when little stars were peeping, 
And the moon in all her glory shone above, 
I've often talked in happier days 
With this one sweet girl I 
love.

Where the sweet magnolias bloom, (Syn.) 
How I 
love their sweet perfume, (Syn.) 
While walking through the scented groves of orange, 
'Neath the calm and silvery light of the moon, 
I 
told my darling of my love, 
-Where the sweet magnolias -Wont. 
Now I've wandered far away from sunny tl3orgia, 
That dear old land I 
love to call my home, 
Yet oft my dreams will take me back, 
As through the world I 
roam. 
There I 
see the pure white blossoms of the cotton, 
As they glisten ' neath the calmly shining moon ; 
There's where I'd like to live and die, 
-Where the sweet magnolias bloom.

Of high degree ;

wink in my eye that does capture the girls, 
And my smiles they can never resist ; 
My black Carolinas the barber he curls, 
And I 
have it gold ring on my fist, 
And every one knows as they look at my clothes 
They're made of good stuff, firm and strong ; 
As I 
walk on the street every damsel I 
meet 
Pipes my figure as I 
move along.

With fifes and drums a- playing martial airs; 
From Ulster, Munster, Connamara, you see we are on hand, 
To march with the music to the tune of the Branigau's Band; 
Oh I

And ev'ry one we meet says, don't they step it neat! 
We smile on all the girls we meet, 
While marching down behind the famous Branigan's BAnd.

With eyes out, toes in, march in grand array ! 
Shoulder arms, with head erect, together hand in hand, 
Like heroes bold the young and old wil) march with the Brani-

The chambermaids in the big hotels, they raise the windeys

For handkerchiefs they're waving towels to catch our soldiers' 
eyes ; 
They've left their hash to come out and wash when the mar-
shal (fives command ; 
Then we all raise our hats to the tune of the Branigan's Band ; 
Oh ! don't their hearts go pit- a- pat, 
As each one lifts his hat, the lean as well as ftzt,

With pickled stews, and hullaboloos, and Irish quail so grand ; 
Beets, and cheese, and some potheen for the boys of the Braui-

Oh it's then we sang, and danc'd a

So when morning comes it's home we steal, 
With the buys all drunk as lords, with the Branigan's Band.

Loved dearly as my life, 
Will give me ere the hour has gone,

What care I

We'll breast life's stormy tide ;

'TwAs up in Central Park, one lovely summer's day, 
My heart was like a 
lark, the sky was bright ail gay ; 
I 
lingered by the lake that sparkled in the sun, 
And, oh, the pretty birds did make sweet music, everyone. 
But soon I 
saw two eyes that fondly glanced at me, 
They seemed to wander from the skies, they looked so 
A 
gentle form drew near; silo smiled—was I 
to blame ? 
Oh wouldn't life be dear, if I 
only knew her name ? 
If I 
only knew her name, if I 
only knew her name; 
Eyes looked sweetest love, to eyes that looked the same ; 
Then twilight softly fell, oh Cupid was to blame 
Oh I'd give the world, if I 
only knew her name. 
We saw the swans go by, like little silver ships ; 
I 
heard the sweetest sigh, from luscious, rosy lips ; 
The stars come out at last, and yet I 
could not go. 
How Quickly then the moments passed, the heart alone 
can know. 
But soon beside the gate we softly bid adieu, 
For oh the hours were growing late, and birds were 
dreaming too; 
I 
wonder when we'll meet; my heart is still the same ; 
Oh life were angel sweet, if I 
only knew her name, 
If I 
only knew her name, etc,

I'M going to wed a 
nice young lass, 
In beauty none can her surpass ; 
You may search . the country all around, 
You'll not find one like Susan Brown. 
Oh, I 
love Sue, and Sue loves me, 
We're happier than king or queen can be, 
But Sue, you must know, has a 
curious way, 
For when I 
go to kiss her she will always say— 
cnontTs. 
Oh, dear me, let me be, get away, do, 
Oh, don't tickle me, now then, Ted, stop your chaff, 
He, he, he, he, 
Oh, you make me laugh ! 
I 
never shall the day forget, 
The first time I 
and Susan met, 
She was milking on a 
three legg'd stool ; 
I 
call'd her duck, she called me fool ; 
She then gave me such a 
slap in the face, 
But I 
didn't mind that for I 
wanted to taste 
Her sweet pretty lips, like the roses so red. 
But when I 
went to kiss her, how she scream'd and said— 
Oh, dear me, etc. 
I 
said 
have one kiss, and then 
My arm went round her waist again ; 
She shouted, " Oh ! I 
feel so queer," 
She scratched my face and pulled my ear ; 
But I 
held fast and declared that I 
Would either have a 
kiss or die ; 
She said, " Well. Ted, if you'll let me be, 
Just take one, duckie darling, but don't tickle me. 
Oh, dear me, etc. 
ENCORE VERSE. 
I'm married now and settled down, 
With my dear darling Susan Brown ; 
We are happy as a 
pair can be, 
And toss the babies on our knee ; 
But when I 
chance to come home late at night, 
She's bound to catch me, and oh, what a 
plight, 
For Susan don't stop to consider ray plea, 
But with a 
pair of flat-irons she tickles me. 
Oh, dear me, etc.

With the neighbors they are friendly, 
They are their mother's joy ;

Friends there meet from every street 
To gossip on our front stoop. 
There's dainty Misses Grogan, 
Alexander McAfee, 
The undertaker Hogan, 
The pride of Calvary. 
Such splendid vocalization,

And how their daughter Mary 
Went down to Coney isle 
With a

Who filled her with clam soup, 
Then they say 
don't give it away,

My heart with love is blooming.

Little Cherry Blossom, will you wed me ? 
While the stars are twinkling in the silent dell

Oh, say I'll await in the gloaming, 
With love ever constant and pure.

Bedecking the sweet new-mown hay, 
While up in the blue heaven's bowers 
Rings sweetly the nightingale's lay. 
Yes, Robin, tell Kitty

I 
TOOK my girl one day, 
A 
sailing down the bay, 
And Emma was the darling creature's name, 
While standing on the pier, 
Some chaps at her did stare ; 
And one and all around her did exclaim : 
CHORUS. 
Oh ! Emma, whoa ! Emma, 
Emma, you put me in quite a 
dilemma, 
! 
Emma, whoa ! Er 
nma, 
That's what I 
hear wherever I 
go 
askil them what they meant ? 
When some ono at me sent 
An ego., 
which nearly struck me in the eve. 
Emma began to scream ! 
" 
Oh, Fred, what does this mean ?" 
I 
ask'd again, and this was their reply— 
Oh ! Emma, etc. 
I 
thought they'd never cease, 
So shouted out " Police !" 
And when he came he looled at me so sly. 
The crowd then at me laugli'd, 
And said I 
must be " daft ;" 
And once again they all commene'd to cry— 
Oh ! Emma, etc. 
An old man said to me, 
"'Why, young man, can't you see 
The joke ?" and I 
look'd at him with surprise t 
He said, " don't be put out, 
It's a 
saying's got about ;" 
And then their voices seem'd to rend the skies, 
Oh ! Emma, etc. 
THE COLLEEN DAWN. 
Sung by " Les Grotesques Eccentrique." 
IN 
the Emerald Isle across the sea, 
I 
left a 
colleen fair ; 
She's beautiful and bright to see, 
With wavy golden hair. 
Her bright blue eyes of heaven's own hue, 
Like the sun at early dawn ; 
Sure the only girl I 
ever loved 
Was mv own sweet Colleen 13awn. 
eTIORUS. 
Sure I 
love her : o; I 
love my own life, 
An' I'll soon go back an' take her for my wife. 
! 
her eyes are as bright as the dew 
On the trees at early dawn ; 
Let come what will, I'll love her still, 
My own Sweet Colleen Dawn. 
Sure many lands I've travelled o'er, 
And many beauties seen ; 
But none of them could half compare 
With my charming Irish queen. 
There's a 
spot in Erin dear to me, 
It's cherished in my heart, 
That's where she promised she'd be mine, 
And that we should never part, 
Sure I 
love her, etc.

YOUR POCKET-BOOK IS YOUR BEST FRIEND. 
Words by ARTIMI. W . 
FIZENCII. 
Music by A. CELL. 
The music of this song is published by E. H. HArtniNG, 221 Bowery, N. Y. 
Price 10 cents. 
THERE are friends you deem true, they will linger near 
you, 
In the flush of prosperity's hours, 
But in poverty's day they will vanish away, 
Like the fading of summer's sweet flowers. 
As you journey along in life's turbulent throng, 
While the hill sides you . climb or descend, 
You will see it some day, I 
am right when I 
say 
That your pocket-book is your best friend ; 
That your pocket-book is your best friend. 
'Tis a 
friend that you need, and a 
true friend indeed, 
Ever ready to give or to lend ; 
For wherever you go, you will find it is so, 
That your pocket-book is your best friend ; 
That your pocket- book is your best friend. 
Our political life is nothing but strife, 
Where all honor is swallowed in gain ; 
But to hint such a 
I 
hing to a 
man of the ring, 
Why of course they would call you insane. 
Many a 
man is in power at this very same hour 
That our honest votes never would send ; 
And the way it is done is quite plain to each one, 
Why their poeket-book was their best friend. 
'Ls a 
friend, etc. 
There's a 
gay young cashier, with a 
thousand a 
year, 
And Ids horses and ladies and wine, 
Oh, he goes at a 
rate quite alarming to state, 
Though he draws on a 
very big mine. 
They discover, some day, he has gambled away 
Many thousands or more, and the end 
Is, they give him a 
year, after that he gets clear, 
For his pocket-book is his best friend. 
'Tis a 
friend, etc. 
THEE' 
S ALWAYS A SEAT IN THE PARLOR 
FOR YOU.

and ClloN IN. 
M USIC 
published by F. W. Il EL)rieN, No. 50 Fourth St., Cincinnati, 0. 
Tim subject to-night of my song is love, 
Something quite heavy to bear ; 
When that being you love to you proves untrue, 
For none else in the world do you care. 
The lady I 
love is an angel divine, 
And with her my life I 
would share ; 
But whene'er I 
go to her house her to see, 
There is always somebody there. 
SPOKEN,—I explained the matter to her the other 
evening, and when I 
had finished, she looked into my 
face this way, and said, that's nothing— 
There's always a 
seat in the parlor for you, 
No matter how many are there ; 
There's always a 
seat in the parlor for you, 
A 
sofa, a 
stool, or a 
chair. 
I 
went to her house one evening last week, 
You may easily judge my surprise ; 
I 
was just going to enter the hallway when 
I 
met that which opened my eyes. 
THERE'S ALWAYS A SEAT IN THE PAilLOR 
FOR YOU.—Concluded. 
For there stood a 
man both tall and stout, 
Who said, what do you wish here ? 
Grabbed me by the neck, threw me out on the walk, 
And the last words I 
could hear while there was— 
CHORUS. 
There's always a 
seat in the gutter for you, 
No matter how many are there ; 
There's always a 
seat in the gutter for you, 
When you come around here have a 
care. 
Now the young men I 
go with all gave me the laugh, 
My troubles to them I 
have told; 
They say I 
am foolish to speak to her, 
Because I've been so often sold. 
No matter how often I 
have or may be, 
My love I 
shall never expel, 
I'll follow her, yes, both day and night, 
And my burdensome tale I 
will tell. 
SPOKEN.—Yes ; 
I 
shall haunt her day and night if it's 
only to hear her say--
CIMIZUS. 
There's always a 
seat in the parlor for you, 
No matter how many are there ; 
There's always a 
seat in the parloi for you, 
A 
sofa, a 
stool, or a 
chair.

CHARLEY OVERSHOES. 
Written by HAnnY BENNETT, and sung with great success 
by HARRY 
Woobsos, at the Howard Athemetun, Boston. 
His name is Charley Overshoes ; 
Some people call him „Takey. 
At night if he drinks too much booze 
In the morning he is shaky. 
His hair is like a 
door- mat ; 
One eye is always black ; 
He looks just like a 
camel, 
With a 
hump upon his back. 
CHOEL7S. 
Ta ta, ta ta, my boozy dear, 
I'll play a 
game of cards, 
And stick you for the beer. 
He'd strike you with a 
cabbage 
If the game he'd lose. 
The man that loves free lunches 
Is Charley Overshoes. 
His necktie is a 
piece of cord, 
This terrible old snoozer. 
He never pays a 
cent of board ; 
Free lunch is what he'd chew, sir. 
His shoes are injun-rubber. 
He'll never stand a 
treat. 
He's the most outrageous grubber 
That ever I 
did meet.

CHARLEY OVERSHOES.—Concluded, 
CHOEUS. 
Tra-la-le, tra-la-le ! 
You'll hear him squeal, 
"I must brace the bar again, 
And get another meal." 
The restaurant and liquor stores 
Know him by his face. 
There's not a 
store in all the town 
But what he's tried to brace. 
He never combs his hair at all, 
And never wears a 
collar. 
If he thought he could get a 
meal 
He'd strike you for a 
dollar. 
His father takes in washing ; 
His mother drives a 
car ; 
But Charley he does nothing 
But loaf around the bar. 
CHORUS. 
So long, so long, 
And 
I 
must behind the stove, 
Or my nose it will get blue. 
If I 
could get a 'bracer : 
Um dying for a 
booze. 
The champion free-luncher 
Is Charley Overshoes.

HURRAH FOR A RACE OR A FAIR. 
Written and sung by JOHNNY PATTERSON. 
On ! 
from Ennis to Limerick one day 
With seine neighboring boys I 
did go, sirs, 
It was race time I 
heard people say, 
And a 
pleasanter time I 
don't know, sirs ; 
They came down from Cork and Kildare, 
From Kerry and sweet Tipperary, 
The Waterford boys they were there, 
And each heart was as light as a 
fairy. 
CHORUS. 
Then hurrah for a 
race or a 
fair, 
Where the boys are all jolly and frisky ; 
Sure 
ne'er see that blackguard dull care, 
Where there's colleens and plenty of whiskey. 
In those days it was horses, not steam, 
That took yon so nate and so cosy, 
By your side sat your own sweet colleen, 
And her cheeks they looked blooming and rosy ; 
In the front sat the driver in state, 
With his whip flying away with the wind, sirs ; 
And to save his poor horses the weight, 
The gossoons he would knock down behind, sirs. 
Then hurrah, etc. 
On the course there was tents, boys, galore, 
There was dancing and plenty of singing ; 
The pipes were playing " Rory 0-More," 
While the bell for the start it was ringing ; 
" 
They're off ! they're off !" was the cry ; 
Sure it was true what the people were saying, 
For two jockeys on the ground I 
did spy, 
And if there were three, two to one would be laying. 
Then hurrah, etc.

ONLY THE WAY ON THE STAGE. 
Song of the Times, composed and sung by FRED. J. 
INIAcKt.sr 
on listen to me, some facts I 
will mention, 
Concerninty, the past and the present strange age, 
And in them, my friends, to you Fit relate, 
Some 11Mo-
is I 
saw one night and played on the stage: 
I 
came to this city with one or two friend, 
And went for a 
stroll, they seemed quite amazed, 
When we read on the bills of the Bowery Theatre, 
And found a 
new Drama was played on the stage, 
The first scene I 
saw was a 
street in New York, 
There a 
poor woman begging, she quite old in age, 
Those sad means she tried to keep her from starving, 
A 
very sad lesson, of life's book a 
page ; 
But a 
policeman passed by, his face seemed all smiles, 
Placed his hand in his pocket and drew forth his wages, 
And he gave part to help this poor wretched woman, 
But ' twas only the way it was played on the stage. 
The scene it then %hanged from a 
street to a 
court room, 
There a 
prisoner on trial for a 
crime very sad, 
'He'd murdered a 
man, by the people respected, 
And the court room was crowded with people so glad 
To see that man punished for the crime he committed ; 
.The jury looked stern, and the jtvbie in a 
rage, 
And they hung that rich man for the murder of Fisk, 
But it was only the way it was played on the stage. 
In the next scene I saw a 
clergyman from Brooklyn, 
Who was dancing a 
hornpipe, and seemed quite the rage, 
Another one from Jersey was playing the violin, 
The audience in front with wonderment gazed ; 
For just at that minute a 
party named Tilton 
Then gave a 
fine sermon on the morals of the age, 
And I 
thought that they practised each sermon they preached, 
But it was only the way it was played on the stage.

Tell me there's joy for the morrow, 
To thee ever true I'll remain.

And call me your darling again ;

BRIDGET ROACH. 
Atn.—'• Nancy Lee." 
Written and snng by JACK Coxnoy. 
Dormis Itoach, I 
drive a 
coach 
Whoa, ho, Mare ! 
Whoa ! Whoa, ho ! Whoa, ho ! 
My love to Bridget Flynn did broach— 
Whoa, ho, Marc : Whoa ! Whoa, ho ! 
But sure she wants to wear the pants ; she likes her beer, 
And every day when I'm away she acts so queer, 
Will wink her eye at passers-by, so devilish sly, 
Whoa, ho, Mare ! 
Whoa ! Whoa, ho ! 
CHORUS. 
A hackman's wife from flirting should be free ; 
Whoa, ho ! such games wont do for me ; 
A 
hackman's wife a 
hackman's star should be— 
Her poker makes me stars to see. 
The other night an awful sight— 
Whoa, Mare ! 
Whoa ! Whoa, ho 
Did cause poor Dennis's heart to blight— 
Whoa, ho, Mare ! 
Whoa ! Whoa, ho 
I 
loud did yelp for aid and help, but I 
was beat ; 
I 
saw a 
man as off he ran, way down the street. 
He left his coat, the scheming bloat, on it was wrote, 
Whoa, ho, Mare 
Whoa Whoa, ho ! 
A 
hackman's wife, etc. 
I 
couldn't stand, like Gideon's Band— 
Whoa, ho, Mare I Whoa ! Whoa, ho ! Whoa, ho ! 
Came all the blackguards in the land, 
Whoa, ho, Mare ! 
Whoa ! Whoa, ho ! 
So I'm again a 
single man, as you can see ; 
Untied the band, no partner plan would do for me. 
I've sold my coach, and Biddy Roach is in the lurch ; 
Whoa, ho, Mare! Whoa! Whoa, ho ! 
A 
hackman's wife, etc.

There is srmething which I 
wish to mention to you, 
'While trying to please with toy song ; 
Some solid advice unto you I 
will give; 
Please listen, it's not very long. 
Your attention I'll call to the poor little boys 
You will meet on the street every day, 
Do not spurn them aside with a 
curse or a 
kick, 
When by chance they are thrown in your way. 
Cnenus. 
Don't think they're too small to be noticed at all, 
Let them share in your sorrows and joys, 
Their love vili repay your kindness some day. 
Don't forget to be kind to the boys. 
If a 
poor boy accosts you while.trying to earn 
By honest means but half a 
dime, 
If you have it to spare, buy a 
paper at once, 
Or invest when he proffers a 
shine. 
He has loved ones at home who upon him depends 
For the poor crusts of bread \duel' they eat; 
And the brave, honest boy, to provide them widi food, 
Has to labor each day in the street. 
Pont think they're too small, etc. 
The greatest of statesmen were once small like me, 
And no one can tell what s 
i-n store 
For a 
boy in the future, if upright he proves, 
No matter if' now he is poor. 
So, unheeded, don't pass the advice which I 
give, 
But by your applause let me see 
That you promise to ever be kind to boys. 
And I 
hope you'll begin here with me. 
Don't think they're too small, etc.

THE obi man ain't himself no mo', be's nearly gone to seed, 
And these hands refuse to do the daily ttoh; 
I never dream'd ' twould come to this, or that I'd be in 
need, 
After years of service in Carlina 
My limbs are bending ' neath their wt ight, my hair is white 
as snow, 
And I 
cannot see the gentle summer sky ; 
My feet grow weary day by day, my step is weak and slow, 
And I'm gwine to leave my comrades by and by.

The good old days when I

hardly knew that I 
was growing old ; 
never stopped to think how these poor arms of mine

For to think that I

And to old Carlina's shores I'd quickly roam.

And to hear the happy darkeys shout and sing

Or the way we used to make the banjo ring ; 
But all is nearly over now, the trumpet soon will sound, 
Then I'll have to cross the river over there ; 
And when I 
set my aching feet upon the sacred gromid, 
I

I'm going to start a 
show, and around this country go, 
With some figures I 
shall have made up in wax, 
Of men who've made a 
name, and won a 
mighty fame, 
So listen while your memory I 
tax. 
A 
small sum you must pay, for any trouble by the way, 
And then a 
list of all I'll give to you, 
And 
have them all to stand, in my little joval baud 
Of figures that make up this little show. 
In this theatre each night, where I'll show to you each 
sight, 
Where Jollity in power rule supreme : 
Every figure you shall see, as exhibited by me, 
Which in my circus tent may soon be seen. 
I'll have Butler peeping sly, as to steal some spoons he'll 
try, 
The Congressmen all taking their back pay ; 
I'll have Grant in Europe stay, eating free lunch every 
day, 
And cheating " John Bull" as he goes his way;

1HE CIRCUS TENT.—Concluded. 
I'll have Moody trying to weep becaase Sankey lost his 
sheep; 
The Mormon chiefs all kissing their last bride. 
I'll have Beecher trying to show, how far a 
workingman 
can go, 
With naught but bread and wat6r at his side. 
I'll have those frauds, the Indian tribes, 
Whom Gen. Howard derides, for they fool him to their 
heart's most great content. 
I'll have England's rifle corps, stopping home on John 
Bull's shore 
A 
losing team beneath this circus tent. 
I'll have the Count Johannes stand, the crushed trage-
dian of this land, 
Our President, who cold water does take, 
Going up in a 
balloon, with Dr. Mary Walker's panta-
loons, 
While Ile tips Susan Anthony the wink. 
I'll have James Gordon Bennett drawn, fighting duels in 
a 
horn, 
As he stood in Delaware and shot the bull. 
I'll have the great George Francis Train playing poker 
with Jim Blaine, 
And Babcock drinking whiskey till he's full. 
I'll have Christianity at work, killing off that nasty Turk, 
And all you people smiling with content, 
If you'll stand up in a 
row, as I 
give my little show, 
Beneath the canvas of my circus tent.

DOWN WHERE THE WATER LILIES GROW

Theatre. 
'Tw.x.s in the pleasant summer time 
I 
met him all by chance, 
The robins sang their sweetest rhyme, 
And loving was their glance ; 
We wandered 'midst the blooming flowers, 
He called me sweet and fair, 
The queen of all the sunny bowers, 
The brightest rosebud there. 
SPOKEN.- 011, he was such a 
charming, such a 
delight-
ful young fellow, that I 
never eau forget : 
CHORUS. 
When we met there by the river 
In the sunlight's merry glow, 
For my heart he won forever 
Down where the water lilies grow. 
He whispered words of fond delight, 
The birds they listened, too ; 
We wandered till the stars at night 
Shone out in sky so blue ; 
When arm in arm we wandered on, 
Way down the lonely lane, 
He said he'd never roam alone, 
And we soon met again. 
SPOKEN.—We are meeting quite often now, and I 
never 
will forget the first time : 
When we met there by the river, etc.

BEECHER'S BREAD AND WATER PLAN. 
Song dedicatoci to the working men of our couutry, by T. 0. 
Ain—'
What the Old Cocksixtrrow Suid. — 
I 
SAT me down to rest and read the other day, 
And judge of my amazement and surprise, 
In glancing at the news, I 
was stricken with dismay, 
When a 
paragraph appeared before my eyes, 
In which the moral preacher, the sanctimonious Beecher, 
Avows that each and every workingman 
Are only fit to die, because they will not try 
To live upon the bread and water plan. 
I 
hung my head with shame, a 
tear unbidden came, 
Great God ! I 
cried, is this American, 
Must we toil with hand and brain, in sunshine and in rain 
To be fed upon the bread and water plan 
Net many years ago, in our broad and fruitful land, 
Such sentiments as Beecher's would not pass ; 
But look around you now, and you'll find on every hand 
A 
purse-proud and aristocratic class. 
Go up to Central Park, some evening just at dark, 
The stockholder sits behind his blooded span, 
Yet we must not stop to think, or a 
glass of beer to drink, 
But be fed upon the bread and water plan. 
Why don't they hang a 
bone upon a 
telephone ? 
Since feeding now by " culture" they've began, 
With a 
smell three times a 
day, I'm sure we'd feel 0. K., 
And it's cheaper than the bread and water plan. 
Now Henry Ward declares, education's thrown away, 
If bread will not sustains us in this life; 
In short, he'd have us live on three meals of it a 
day, 
And on it feed six children and a 
wife, 
And soon 'twill come to pass, they'll feed us on blue glass, 
Since science is a 
never- failing cure, 
And true inwardness and gush, ragged edge and Ply-
mouth slush, 
Will satisfy our wants and keep us pure; 
Hallelujah 
let us pray, give praise each night and day, 
The time has come when every workman 
May bid farewell to care, and live on sumptuous fare, 
With Brother Beecher's bread and water plan.

THE HUNGRY MAN FROM HARLEM. 
Sung with immense success by JAMES 
OF 
a 
hungry man I'm going to sing, 
And tears to your eyes it will surely bring, 
He could swallow almost anything, 
This hungry man from Harlem. 
He'd eat a 
hundred times a 
day 
And for his board he could not pay, 
He could get outside of a 
bale of hay, 
This hungry man from Harlem 
CHORUS. 
The way he'd eat it couldn't be beat 
All kinds of meat both sour and sweet, 
He'd eat everything they had in the place, 
And bite a 
big chunk from his mother-in-law's face. 
He chewed up his father, devoured his mother, 
He swallowed his sister and tackled his brother, 
He swallowed the clock, bit a 
hole in the door, 
Chewed a 
hole in the roof and swallowed the floor, 
He chewed up his shoes and chewed up his hat, 
Made a 
raid on the kitchen and swallowed the cat. 
He chewed umbrellas and eat seven stoves, 
And bit off one-half of the servant girl's nose. 
And that's the way he used to eat, 
This hungry man from Harlem.

Ile tackled a 
crowd coming home from a 
ball, 
They began for to dance and he swallowed them 
lie went down to the ferry and swallowed a 
boat, 
lie went out on election and chewed up his vote. 
At last he came into Brooklyn town, 
Ho met a 
big preacher, and gobbled him down ; 
He swallowed a 
pump, put his teeth thro' the handle, 
And eat the reports of the Brooklyn scandal. 
Then, gating disgusted with grub so light, 
He swallowed himself clean out of sight, 
And that's the way he used to eat, 
This hungry man from Harlem. 
The way he'd eat, etc.

How oft have I 
sat by the brookside, 
Which glides by the old cabin door, 
Where the wide spreading elm tree branches 
Arch the pure pearly fountains o'er, 
And dreamed sweet dreams of a 
future, 
And treasures of love yet in store, 
While the low softly-murmuring waters, 
Were wooing the breeze from the moor. 
CHORUS. 
How oft have I 
sat by the brookside, 
Which glides by the old cabin door, 
Where the wide spreading elm tree branches, 
Arch the pure pearly fountains o'er. 
Yes, oft have I 
sat by the brookside, 
With a 
light heart which innocence gave 
My feet hanging over the waters, 
And leisurely kissed by the wave. 
With eyes gazing on the green branches, 
Which gracefully nodded above, 
My hands idly plucking the daisies, 
My soul in the city of love. 
How oft have I 
sat, etc. 
Thus dreaming sweet dreams of a 
future, 
Beyond this present of strife, 
The elms were the trees of Eden, 
And the brooklet the stream of life. 
-Yes, dreaming sweet dreams of it heaven, 
For above this sad world of strife ; 
The cot is the palace golden. 
The brooklet the river of life. 
How oft have I 
sat, etc. 
MY HEART IS BENT UPON A SAILOR 
By NED HARRIGAN. 
As sung by Rosa LEE. 
Oh, I 
love to see the ships, 
Sail in from foreign trips, 
I 
wish I 
was a 
mermaid in the water; 
Or else a 
little pearl, 
Or the darling little girl, 
That the sailors call jolly Neptune's daughter .' 
Then when a 
ship would wreck, 
I 
would jump upon the deck, 
Or through a 
golden horn I 
would hail her; 
I'd pick out from the crew 
Some jolly tar in blue, 
For my heart is always on a 
sailor. 
I'd be constant as a 
dove 
To my bonny own true love, 
If he left me the seas to go a 
roamin'; 
I 
would dream at night of him, 
Aloft in a 
gale of wind, 
You'd never catch me sighing or a 
moaning. 
Saying " I'll meet my darling boy 
With his jolly ship ahoy ; 
Who'd be a 
lawyer or a 
tailor, 
I 
never will get wed 
Unless my husband tread 
The deck of a 
vessel as a 
sailor." 
Written by W. A. lIncrLEr, banjoist, for W ILL. H. 
MonTox. 
Down among the daisies, by the running stream, 
Where the waters ripple soft and low; 
Sitting with my darling, in a 
happy dream, 
Heedless of the hours that come and go. 
There I 
meet my darling every summer's day, 
And the leaflets nodding up above 
Were the only ones that list to what we'd say, 
As we whispered o'er our tales of love.

Sitting by my darling, in a 
happy dream, 
Heedless of the hours that come and go. 
Down among the daisies we will ever dwell, 
In a 
little cottage by the stream; 
Naught will ever come to break the happy spell, 
Break the happy glimmer of our dream. 
Days may come and go, like flowers that bloom and die, 
But as long as life is with us, queen, 
We will dwell together, you and I, 
Down among the daisies by the stream. 
Down among the, etc. 
THE RISING POLITICIAN. 
Written and sung by HARRY BENNETT. 
Goon evening to ye all, 
I've come to make a 
call, 
And tell ye of in 
victory 
Upon election (lay. 
I 
ran for alderman, 
And lurphv was the man 
Who tried hard to defeat me, 
lint he gave himself away ; 
lie never tried repeatin', 
And that's the way 1 
beat him-
1 
voted seven times myself 
In the ould Fourth Ward so gay. 
CHORUS. 
Now I'm a 
politician, 
I 
hold a 
high position 
I 
gained by repetition 
Upon election day. 
I 
took the gang around 
Where the free lunch could be found, 
And many 's the plate of soup, my boy; 
Did they put out of sight; 
We swept the district clean, 
And the divil such a 
scene 
Was known in New York city, boys, 
Upon election night ; 
Cigar signs, barrels, boards we burned 
When the victory it was earned 
It gave me satisfaction and 
It tilled me wid delight. 
Now I'm a 
politician, etc. 
And now I'll tell to you 
What I 
am going to do ; 
not forget the workingmen, 
To them I 
will be true ; 
They shall have eight hours a 
day, 
And a 
fair amount of pay, 
And live as well as those big bugs 
Upon Fifth Avenue ; 
Sure I'll improve the city, 
For I 
think it is a 
pity 
That poor men should be starving 
When there's public work to do. 
CHORUS. 
So let ye all be merry, 
And don't ye vote contrary, 
And I 
will show ye, one and all, 
What an Irishman can do. 
AWFULLY AWFUL.

Pr!cc ten cents. 
Written and composed by G. W. HuNT. 
They tell me I 
am too bashful by far, 
And sometimes I 
think they are right, 
But so awfully naughty the masculines are, 
No wonder one feels in a 
fright. 
I've been led to believe men were born to deceive, 
So when they their compliments pay, 
In language absurd, I 
don't hear a 
word, 
But first as a 
caution I 
say: 
CHORUS. 
Go away, get along, go along, get away, 
You don't say what you mean, or mean what you say; 
Go away, naughty boy, go ever so far, 
You are so awfully awful, you are. 
Go away, get along, go along, get away, 
You don't say what you mean, or mean what you say; 
Go away, naughty boy, go ever so far, 
You are so awfully awful, you aro. 
When I 
go to a 
ball, and one asks me to dance, 
At the finish I 
soon slip away, 
For I 
know Mr. Noodle, if he has the chance, 
Is sure to have something to say: 
So I 
stop the sad man as soon as I 
can, 
In case he'd be going too far, 
Perhaps what he'd tell me he has told two or three, 
For such sad Don Giovanis they are. 
Go away, etc. 
I 
dread Christmas time whene'er it Comes '
round, 
'Tho' it's awfully jolly, I 
know, 
But so many young men, again and again, 
Lead me under the mistletoe; 
Oh I 
would you believe, on last Christmas eve, 
I 
found a 
young man at my feet, 
With an offer of marriage, a 
mansion and carriage, 
Of course I 
soon beat a 
retreat. 
Go away, etc. 
CRUEL GAL. 
(BANJO Sow.) 
By HARRY WATSON, CI 
W ATSON & ELLIS. 
Behold a 
poor deluded young man, 
With his cheeks besmeared with tears, tears, tears, 
Through the affections of one I 
loved, 
And courted for many long years. 
I 
treated her to ico cream and wino, 
But soon came the day of my woes, 
Oh, she fell in love with another sardine,— 
Ho was a 
man with a 
wart on his nose 
Oh, the cause of my agitation was 
A fellow that walked the tight rope, rope, rope, 
lie wrote a 
letter to my false one, 
Asking her to elope! 
She sent him a 
lock of her blue red hair, 
And said she'd be his darling rose; 
With a 
big butcher knife I 
swore revenge, 
On tho man with a 
wart on his nose. 
One night he made me feel very jealous, 
He announced on his rope would walk, walk, walk; 
So I 
resolved to put an end to his life, 
By playing a 
trick with his chalk. 
So I 
greased his rope with a 
tallow candle, 
And smiled as he walked on his toes; 
lie slipped and fell on a 
big brick bat, 
And busted the wart on his nose. 
Oh, they bathed his head in kerosene oil, 
But no sign of life did he make ! 
So I 
resolved to speak to my rose once more, 
But bravely she gave me the shake, shake, shake, 
So in sad despair I 
wander, 
My heart for some one to dispose, 
My Rosey keeps as a 
relic in a 
little alcohol, 
That wart I 
knocked off his nose.

OH ! 
MOSES. 
Sung by FRANK Bum. 
Air..—" Whoa, Emma." 
ONE day I 
had a 
thought, 
A 
little yacht I 
bought 
To take my family down to Coney Isle ; 
But as I 
neared the beach, 
A 
gang began to screech, 
But I 
did only turn around and smile. 
SPOKEN. — Yes, I 
didn't mind the boys, but just as we 
were making for a 
hotel, I 
heard them all holler out —

Oh ! Moses, oh ! Moses! 
Look at them sheenies, 
Oh ! ain't they got noses, 
Oh! Moses, oh ! Moses. 
Dot's what they cry at me morning and night. 
My wife felt very bad, 
And said dose boys are mad, 
And asked me if I 
could the reason tell ; 
I 
said I 
did not know, 
But home we'd better go, 
And as we started they began to yell : 
Oh ! 
Moses, etc. 
We got into a 
boat, 
And when we were afloat, 
A. rotten goose-egg hit me in the eye ; 
It spoilt my bran new clothes, 
And stuffed up all my nose, 
And then to make it worse they all did cry : 
Oh! Moses, etc.

WHAT THE OLD COCK SPARROW SAID. 
As sung by FRANK LNIVI 
with immense applause. 
ONE day I 
took a 
walk, rambling, thro' the Central Park, 
It was at the close of a 
bright autumn day, 
To enjoy the evening breeze as it swift sped thro' the trees, 
And watch the fountain's water brightly play. 
After walking once around, a 
rustic bench I 
found, 
And sitting down a 
moment just to rest, 
When alvoice I 
heard above, saying, Soon to you I'll prove 
That honesty of puipose is the best. 
As I 
looked up with surprise, a 
strange sight met my eyes, 
Some fifty spu-rows gathered o'er my head ; 
A 
big cock 51trrow spoke, with age his feathers broke, 
And this was what the old cock sparrow said : 
" 'Tis strange such things to hear, we are getting worse 
each year, 
The laboring men now cannot get a 
meal, 
About fifty cents a 
day is all they earn for pay, 
It's no wonder that the poor man has to steal. 
And our parsons do not preach, or longer virtue teach, 
At secret kissing they are most expert ; 
And our politicians all for their living shout and bawl, 
And talk of nothing but that bloody shirt. 
And our lecturers who roam, like naughty men from home, 
Through sleeping cars in dreams be blindly led, 
Like Tilton, sweet to furl his arms 'round some pretty 
girl !' 
This was part of what the old cock sparrow said.

WHAT THE OLD COCK SPARROW SAID.— 
Concluded. 
"To the demagogues who dare talk again of civil war, 
On the fourth of March ' twill be all right, I 
say. 
Boss Tweed is back again from that dirty land called 
Spain, 
And I 
hope that in confinement he'll not stay. 
For supposing he did rob, no poor man wanted a 
job, 
He took it from the rich to give the poor ! 
I'd rather run the risk, be ruled by men like him and Fisk, 
For then no beggars hungered at your door. 
Of such things soon we'll tire, look at the great Brooklyn 
fire 
They condemned the theatres—when the folks were 
dead! 
Had they done it but before, we should not the fire de-
This was part of what the old cock sparrow said. 
" 
In the Glection long since gone, none knows which man 
has won, 
They did the " counting " just themselves to please ; 
Let returning boards net fair, and do things on the square, 
And we care not if it's Tilden or it's Hayes. 
But one thing we must see, in this land so great and. free, 
That work in plenty shall be got for all ; 
And the scoundrels who would lower the wages of the 
poor, 
How quickly we will send them to the wall !" 
At this a 
shout did rise, which ascended to the skies, 
From the sparrows that did flutter o'er my head ; 
They said his words were right, as they flew into the 
night, 
And they voted all the old cock sparrow said.

MY GRAVE'S KEPT 
Sung by I
TALEy, W EST, ana SrAnzs BRoTnEms, 
Wilms; I've passed, in my cheeks, little ros;.-
-.bud, 
When I'm six feet under the turf, 
I'll forgive, you though you took me for a 
sucker, 
And played me for every penny I 
was worth ; 
You said I 
might " look, but I 
musn't touch," 
And " you put me in quite a 
dilemma," 
But there's one little snap which I 
wish you would fake up, 
That's to see my grave is whitewashed every summer. 
Oh, the days will come to you, poison face. 
When you'll think of how you back-capped me when I 
was living. 
Clean the snow off my grave with a. pitchfork, will you, 
darling ? 
And decorate my grave with turkey breast, Thanksgiv-
ing ? 
Don't get cranky when I 
ask you to remember 
How you used to give me taffy on a 
stick ; 
With your dizzy jokes you nearly paraly7.ed me. 
But, my darling, you can't say I 
ever kicked ; 
I 
will meet you in that everlasting " By and By," 
Tra la lee, skip the sofa, you're my Baby, 
Plant huckleberry trees on the next lot to me, d:u.ling, 
And see that- my grave is kept shady ; 
Oh, my name will soon be Dennis, sweet Aleena, 
When you had a 
dollar 1 
always stuck to you. 
Get a 
host of volunteers to play some kind of' music, 
And see my grave is kept red, white and blue.

JACK THE CONNAUGHT RANGER. 
Written by JOHNNY PATTERSON. 
Originally and only sung by JACK CONROY. 
On, I'm one that's fond of pleasure ; 
It is my greatest pride, 
And in my hours of leisure 
To go toddling thro' the glide. 
0, give to me the outside sport, 
It is so gay and airy, 
For all the boys around the park 
They call me Boston Mary. 
CHORUS. 
With my tita la, oh, tita la! 
Wherever I 
may go, 
I'm one that's fond of pleasure, 
Is Boston Mary, oh. 
With my tita la, my tita lit! 
Wherever I 
may lark, 
You bet I 
have the best costume 
Of any of the girls in the park. 
I 
have a 
charming sweetheart, 
And Joey, that's his name ; 
At summer time often on the lawn 
We play the croquet game. 
Oh, do I 
not admire it ? 
My chance I 
-would not miss ; 
Before my petty parts with me 
Ills darling he must kiss. 
With my tita la, etc. 
One evening, while out rambling— 
"I'was shortly after dark— 
My Joe and I 
went meandering 
Up to -Washington Park.

We met with a 
parcel of loons. 
One asked me to pay a 
visit with him 
To one of the " tea-rooms." 
With my tita la, etc. 
Am.—" Judy M'Carthy." 
ARRIH, come out of the way, make room for one 
That never knew any sorrow ; 
But snaps his fingers at dull care, 
Crying better times to-morrow. 
I 
can do what I 
like with what's my own, 
And to sorrow I 
am a 
stranger ; 
I 
am gay and light both day and night, 
I'm Jack the Connaught Ranger. 
CHORUS-. 
Then hurrah, my boys, for fun and noise, 
I'm the boy that fears no danger ; 
My purse is light, but my heart is right. 
I'm Jack the Connaught Ranger. 
Shure I'm in love with a 
fair colleen, 
And her name is Mary Ryan ; 
Together we dance upon the green, 
Oh ! about her, faith I'm dying. 
There's lovers comes about her smart, 
Like asses round a 
manger ; 
But there's not one can melt her heart 
Like Jack the Connaught Ranger. 
Then hurrah, etc, 
Good night, my friends, I 
must away, 
I 
must, upon my honor, 
For I've promised to have a 
cup of tea 
Along with Judy O'Connor.; 
And if I 
call some other night, 
Don't think that I'm a 
stranger, 
For to please you all ' tis my delight,

DANCING THE GLIDE. 
Sung with immense applause by W. E. Lvt.s. 
OF 
all the many dances, 
That everywhere I've tried, 
There's none that suits my style so well 
As the dancing of the Glide. 
I've tried the bop-waltz and the plain, 
But of all the styles I 
pride 
Myself when music swells the air 
To dancing of the Glide. 
Dancing to the Glide, 
The fascinating Glide ; 
Of all the styles, I 
like the best, 
'Tis (lancing to the Glide. 
Dancing to the Glide, 
The fascinating Glide ; 
Of all the styles, I 
like the best, 
'Tis dancing to the Glide. 
There's some that think the Polka, 
Or Seliottisch is the best ; 
But for good style and elegance, 
The Glide beats all the rest. 
So let the world take it's own choice, 
I 
by my taste abide ; 
For naught can suit my style so well 
As dancing of the Glide. 
Dancing to the Glide,

York is the greatest Cosmopolitan City on the Earth's surface. 
Something 
of every city is to be seen here. 
The most advanced Communist touches 
elbows with the proudest scions of the most artistic families of the Old 
World. 
Vices such as sapped the might of Ilabybal and ltome, and are 
sapping the manhood of Vienna, of Paris, of London, are necessarily de-
scribed in a 
book like t

BOOK OF FATE. 
The only CompIete American, from the Fillieth 
Londmi Edition. 
This is the oldest, and for that very reason the best of Fortune Tellers. 
It was compiled in the remote ages, when learned men consulted the stars, 
and watched and interpreted the decrees of fate, and inquired into and 
often mastered the mysteries of what we vaguely term Chance. 
Certain it 
is, that Bonaparte obtained a 
copy of this book, written 141011 papyrus. 
Ile 
curiously consults it. 
From that time a 
gloom overspread his massive brow. 
Did it dimly reveal to him Moscow, Waterloo, St. Helena ? We only know 
it was found in his carriage after his last great fight. 
Tens of thousands 
consult this Oraculum with daily increasing faith, in its truthful answerings.
