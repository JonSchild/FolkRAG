I'd Like to be a 
Sunflower. 
Words and music by Edwin Talbot. 
Sung with great success by 
Fayette Welsh. 
I'd like to be a 
sunflower, 
If I 
might be a 
flower, 
My petals closing softly 
At twilight's quiet hour. 
And waking in the morning 
When falls the early dew, 
To welcome heaven's bright sunshine, 
And heaven's bright tear-drops toe. 
CHORUS. 
I'd like to be a 
sunflower, 
If I 
might be a 
flower 
My petals closing softly 
At twilight's quiet hour. 
I 
love the gentle lily, 
It looks so meek and fair, 
But sunflowers I 
love better, 
For they grow every where, 
The lilies bloom so sadly 
In the sunshine or in shower, 
But sunflowers still look upward 
However dark the hour. 
Chorus,.

My Dear Old Home Where Roses Grew. 
Written by Edward Talbot for Fayette Welsh and sung by him 
with great success. 
0! how often when at eve I'm sitting, 
Near the hearthstone, where the herfilock burns, 
Cherish'd forms I 
see before me flitting, 
And in fancy's dream my home returns; 
Mem'ry fond delights to linger ever, 
'Round the scenes that childhood knew, 
0! Would that I 
had left thee never— 
Home! my dear old home where roses grew. 
CHORUS. 
O! would that I 
had left thee never— 
Home! my dear old home where roses grew. 
Oft my aged father comes before me, 
And my mother mourns her absent son, 
Now their parting blessings hover o'er me, 
As the flowers blossom one by one; 
Nothing from my heart those ties can sever, 
Time hath proved all their affection true. 
O! would that I 
had left thee never— 
Home! my dear old home where roses grew. 
Chorus. 
May kind angels watch around them, 
Health and plenty, banish care and fear, 
All the joys of happy life surround them, 
Bless'd and honor'd be their dwelling here; 
'When the weary toil of life is over, 
And we calmly change the old for the new, 
O! may we meet and find another 
Home, as dear as that where roses grew. 
CHORUS. 
0! may we meet and find another 
Home, as dear as that where roses grew. 
There Never was a 
Coward Where the Shamrock 
Grows. 
Respectfully dedicated to Fayette Welsh, and sung with great 
success by Edwin Talbot in his Parlor entertainments. 
Let cowardly slanderers say what they may, 
Against the dear land of my birth; 
But I 
will maintain in spite of all foes, 
It's the dearest green spot on this earth. 
Some say we are cowards and fit for . iaught else 
But drinking our home-made potheen 
But I'll throw back the villainous lie in their face, 
We're as brave as the shamrock is green. 
CHORUS. 
Pat may be foolish and very often wrong, 
Pat s 
got a 
temper which don't last very long, 
Pat is full of jollity as everybody knows. 
But there never was a 
coward where the shamrock grows. 
Tho' oppress'd and insulted for hundreds of years 
By the foe who once conquered them, they 
Have left us the courage our forefather's had— 
For that they cannot take away. 
They kept learning-from us, stole all we hold dear, 
And crushed us till others cried shame; 
But in spite of it all we have struggled to learn 
That courage and wit are the same, 
Chorus.

HELEN'S BABIES. 
Illus!e published and copyrighted by GEO. M OLECEUX, 44 Fourth Street, 
Brooklyn. Price 40 cents. 
Words by R. E. O'BnIEN. 
Sung by W ILL H . 
MoRrox. 
When telling that same ancient story, 
That's new since the days of the ark," 
That soul thrilling moment of pleasure, 
That gleam of love's light thro' the dark; 
Our hopes and our fears are all waiting, 
One word from a 
fair maiden's lip, 
If " no " all the world is a 
desert, 
If " yes" life's best nectar we sip. 
CHORUS. 
Our hopes and our fears are all waiting, 
One word from a 
fair maiden's lip, 
If " no" all the world-is a 
desert, 
If " yes" life's best nectar we sip. 
A 
blessing, just then, is a 
baby, 
Who comes as if sent from above, 
To say to our sweetheart that really, 
"What we call 'espect, he calls love;" 
And when the sweet damsel surrenders, 
Excuse for most exquisite bliss, 
The quiet remark of the young one, 
"Whoever I 
love, why, I 
kiss." 
(Chorus): 
" 
Ali! babies, though mar-plots, you're jewels," 
If one has the talent to take 
The proper amount of advantage, 
Of all the queer blunders you make 
And many a 
lover has reason, 
To bless for the whole of his life, 
The infant whose timely intrusion, 
compelled him to 
k for his wife. 
(Chorus),

THAT GOOD OLD HOME WE'LL NEVER SEE 
AGAIN. 
Written and composed by W . 
J. 
GROGAN, and sung by GROGAN 
and BURKE with immense success. 
Copyright, A. 
J. 
FISHER, 1878. 
W AY down in dear old Charleston, in South Carolina State, 
In that dear old spot we passed our happiest days. 
It's there we had a 
home that we once called our own, 
But on that old home we never more shall gaze. 
We together often sat in the doorway of our cot, 
A 
listening to the niggers in the Cane; 
But now we're left alone this wide world for to roam, 
For we'll never see that good old home again. 
CHORUS. 
Then give me this old wife, who is my joy through life; 
I'll comfort her in sorrow or in pain. 
Oh, it's often we regret, and try hard to forget, 
That good old home we'll never see again. 
In this home we loved so well we with happiness did dwell, 
But, alas! each one soon bore a 
heavy heart, 
For a 
cloud soon overspread and hovered overhead, 
Which caused our happy family to part. 
Old inassa and old Missa to the angels they have gone, 
In happiness and bliss there to remain; 
While we are quite forlorn, and left here for to mourn 
For that good old home w&11 never see again. 
Then give me this old wife, etc. 
The colored folks' delight was on a 
summer's night 
To sing and dance for hours upon the green; 
We those old hoofs could shake, when a " walking for dat 
cake," 
Though we think sometimes the past was but a 
dream. 
Now that we're turning gray, and soon must pass away, 
As in youth, together in old age remain 
Until the day does come that our work on earth is done; 
We'll think no more of that good old home again. 
Then give me this old wife; etc.

STRAWBERRIES AND CREAM. 
Composed and written by W . 
H. 
DELEHANTY. 
Milk and honey, Oh! its funny— 
I 
cannot keep from dancing; 
For I 
love a 
girl—she's a 
pretty pearl— 
A 
lovely belle supreme— 
She's a 
lolly-pop—sweet forget-me-not--
And her voice is so entrancing, 
She's my honeycomb, she's my sugar- plum, 
She's strawberries and cream. 
Yes, she's a 
basket full of fruit, 
She's my pretty love, she's my turtle dove. 
Her voice is like the music of a 
flute, 
And she's just sweet sixteen. 
CHORUS. 
Milk, honey, strawberries and cream (gym.), 
Like the music of a 
happy dream (
sym.). 
She's a 
darling! she's a 
daisy, 
She's a 
lovely plate of peaches, 
She's a 
dandy—'lasses candy— 
She's strawberries and cream. 
Repeat Chorus,. 
I'm enraptured, I 
am captured, 
By a 
lovely lump of sweetness. 
She's an oyster pie, she's a 
chicken pie, 
Aad she haunts my every dream. 
She's a 
little maid, she's a 
lemonade, 
And the pink of perfect neatness. 
She's a 
box of dates, she's a 
bunch of grapes, 
She's strawberries and cream. 
Oh! yes, she's far too sweet to live, 
Is this lolly, 
pop, is this candy shop, 
And her loss I 
know that I 
would grieve— 
sweet vision of my dream. 
Milk, honey, Mo.' 
SALLY, BLESS MY SOUL! 
Made Popular by our Song and Dance Artists, Messrs. 
W AY & LOVELY. 
I 
should like to know the reason why 
As I 
go down the street, 
There is a 
twinkle in the eye 
Of every girl I 
meet. 
I 
ask'd my Cousin Sally once, 
Why it was she smiled so sweet ? 
She says I 
am a 
perfect dunce— 
They're laughing at your feet! 
CHORUS. 
I 
blushed and bowed my head with grief. 
• 
My anguish to control ; 
And said, when I 
could catch my breath, 
Oh, Sally, bless my soul! 
Of all the talent I 
possess, 
Those feet they are my pride ; 
They are good size, and cost me less 
To walk with than to ride ; 
They always take me out of town 
As fast as I 
can go! 
And Sally fills me with alarm, 
By talking to me so. 
I 
blushed, tte, 
Now I've resolved to search this town, 
Some smaller shoes to try; 
That will not draw the glances down 
Of every passer by. 
I'll get a 
smaller pair, I 
vow, 
And dress up in the style 
And when I 
meet my love, I'll bow 
And r.tise my Harvard tile ! 
She blushed, &c.

SASSY NIGGER SAM! 
Plantation Song and Dance, written and performed only by the origi-

World, HARPER & STANsim.. 
OH my name is Sassy Sam, 
I'se a 
dark- eyed contraband, 
Way down on the Chickahominy I 
was born. 
Oh my massa run away, 
When de Union soldiers play, 
So I 
started for the Non f

I 
soon met wid a 
man 
What kotched me by the hand, 
And he led me to an Abolition meeting, 
Where de brudders dey did speech, 
And de sisters dey did preach, 
And dey said that my 'plexion it was light. 
And to the world cley'd teach 
What a 
point dat aey could reach, 
And s.rhow dat dey could wash a 
nigger white. 
[Dance. 
Oh den dey kotched me soon, 
Aud (ley put me in a 
room, 
Oh, dis nigger didn't know what dey was arter. 
Den (ley stripped off all my close, 
And now, what do you 'spose ? 
They slapped me in a 
tub of scalding water. 
And den dey got around, 
Sonic scrubbing brushes found, 
Sed dey'd wash me whiter dan any paper. 
Den some began to scrub, 
While de oders (ley did rub, 
And dey kep it up all dat night. 
ut you may rub and you may scrub, 
You may wash and you may wip., 
But a 
nigger will be r. nio-ger, and dam if you 
can wash him white.

Still my menery will steal o'er 
To dat dear old Cabin floor, 
When de shadow of de sun came peeping in; 
At night, when all was dark, 
We would hear de watch-dog bark, 
And we'd listen to the murmur of the wind. 
It seem to say to me. 
"You people must be free," 
For de happy time am coming, Lord be praised! 
For then we would weep and moan, 
For our souls was not our our own, 
In dem agonizing, cruel slav'ry days.

I 
am very old and feeble, 
And our life am nearly done; 
I 
have travell'd in the roughest kind of road; 
Through sicknems, toil and sorrow 
I 
have reach' de end at last, 
And I'm resting by de wayside wid my load. 
Forget now and forgive, 
Has always been my guide, 
For dat's what de scripture surely says; 
But our mem'ry will turn roun, 
When our souls dey were tied down, 
In dem agonizing, 0_10 slay'ry days.

BREAK NECK SONG AND DANCE. 
Written and composed by BILLY M AYO, and sung with immense succes , 
by M AYO and FASH at Fox's American Theatre, Philadelphia. 
Oh, we just came in from Washington this morning, (Crash.) 
We have got to take the boat at Calermerzue. (Crash.) 
Oh, we stopped here for refreshments, 
And to talk politics out of existence, 
We're Representatives from the White House in Washington, 
CHORUS, 
Oh, we sport around the town, 
Our equals can't be found, 
The Mayor and Aldermen they want us then 
For to come and sup and dine, 
Though we scarcely have the time— 
We Representatives from the White House in Wash-
ington. (Dance.) 
Now we must leave, for we can no longer stay, ( Crash.) 
For if we do you know ' twill never pay. (Crash.) 
In the merry month of May, 
When the flowers bloom so gay. 
Now mind, don't give us away, 
Hey, what do you say ? 
Oh, we sport around, &c.

PINAFORE. 
Words by Joie PETTINGILL, of the AMERICAN Fo1:11, 
When I 
was young and had no sense, 
I 
went to a 
picnic and I 
beat the fence, 
I 
had just dropped over and hid in the grass, 
When a 
copper hauled off and struck me in the neck, 
And for beating that picnic so carefully, 
I 
got six months in the penitentiary. 
(Repeat last two lines.) 
When I 
arrived at the age of eleven or more, 
I 
stole all the sweet potatoes from the grocery store, 
I 
stayed out late at nights and wouldn't go home, 
Just look at me now I'm nothing but a 
bone, 
But I 
stole those potatoes so carefully, 
That now I 
am the owner of a 
grocery. 
(Repeat last two lines.)

• See That Angel Band. 
As Sung by JAMES Ho, 
of the AMERICAN Fora. 
Oh, see that angel band, they're calling me away, 
I 
ain't got long to tarry, just hear that trumpet play, 
When the sun comes up in the meadow we rise just like 
the lark, 
We work all day on massa's farm and then dance after dark. 
CHORUS. 
Keep the banjo ringing, we'll get dar just in time, 
Keep the banjo ringing, we want to go to heaven when we 
die. 
Then come and join the band, the train is on the way, 
Don't you hear the whistle blowing, we ain't got long to 
stay, 
The silver stars are shinining on wings of glory bright, 
We'll meet you in the morning all beaming with delight. 
(Mona.)

RAMAIIAMALOO. 
Written and originally sung by BILLY CAETza. 
Now Pll sing to you a 
little song 
That you've never heard before, 
You'll bust your ears with laughing, 
And fall upon the floor; 
For remember that a 
rolling stone 
Is worth twenty on a 
tree, 
So stay at home and don't go out 
To skip the tra la la lee. 
Now an elephant was a 
sitting 
And locking up his trunk, 
Some boys fed him on pepper sauce, 
And soon it made him drunk, 
He broke the keeper in pieces, 
And roared an awful roar, 
Swallowed eleven peanut stands, 
And a 
bushel of apple core. 
A 
parrot sat a 
winking 
And blinking at a 
crow, 
They both went to a 
theatre, 
To see the latest show. 
The crow it got a 
fighting 
With a 
Scotch terrier purp, 
The parrot eat a 
fire cracker 
And blew the theatre up.

He sends corn beef to the rolling mill, 
And they mould it into hash. 
There's been a

Over on the other shore,

We beat him on the turf, 
With the Arizona clipper ship 
We beat him on the surf.

Little Cabin Home in South Caroline. 
Wiitten by N ED OLIVER, and sung by J. F. 
FIELDS. 
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, 
I'm glad to see you all; 
I 
was just a 
passing by this way, 
I 
thought I'd give you a 
call, 
To tell you how the darkies 
Used to frolic one and all, 
In that little cabin home in South Caroline. 
CHORUS. 
Don't talk of 'mancipation proclamation unto me; 
I 
was happier in slavery then I've been since I've been free. 
Oh ! we war so jolly, we war as happy as could be 
In that little cabin home in South Caroline. 
We used to get up in the morn, 
Before the break of day, 
And go off singing to our work 
In the cotton fields away. 
And when night came we'd sing and dance 
And on the banjo play, 
In that little cabin home in South Caroline. 
CHORUS. 
But these happy days are past and gone many years ago, 
My eyes are growing weak and dim, my steps are getting slow, 
And the time am drawing nearer now in which I'll have to go 
From that little cabin home in South Caroline.

In all the pretty innocence of love.

I'm sure that you folks must envy me. 
Of course she's lots of followers, 
That seek her young affections to engage, 
She knows their hearts are hallower 
Than mine, although she's all the rage. 
Her pretty feet are small and neat, 
And then her waltzing is really quite divine. 
Her eyes shine bright like stars at night, 
Quite melt me with their brilliant dreamy shino.

THE MINSTREL'S DREAM. 
An original song, as sung by FRANK LEWIS with immense 
success. 
One eve while sitting in my chair before my fire so bright, 
Its rays dispelled the midnight gloom, and lightened up the 
night, 
My thoughts reverted to the past, and brought before my gaze, 
The shadowed forms of minstrels great, the kings of by-gone 
days; 
I 
saw the people laugh and cry, as alternately they gave— 
The merry pun, the mirthful joke, the ballad sweet and grave, 
They formed a 
quaint procession, as they passed before my 
sight, 
The minstrels of our former days, thus conjured from the night. 
I 
saw George Christy shake the bones, sweet music from them 
drag, 
And how the audience it would roar, as he told each merry gag, 
Saw " Daddy " Rice in ecstacy, those legs of his to throw 
The father of the minstrels—he who danced the first " Jim 
Crow ;" 
Heard Mulligan, with towering form, pathetic ballads sing, 
When Long John opened once his mouth, ' twas down the house 
he'd bring, 
Stevie Rogers gave his excelsior clog, the greatest ever seen, 
And other well-
known faces came to fill my minstrel's dream. 
Nelse Seymour showed his giant form, and passed me by and 
smiled, 
friend to every one in need, the minstrel's favorite child, 
29 
How oft I've heard his merry laugh, as he made the nit
-rlat pass 
o'er, 
Give out the joke which ever set the audience in a 
real 
He scarcely disappeared when came the minstrel king and 
man, 
The glory of the boys in black—the merrplaughing Dan, 
As Bryant passed me by, his face with radiance seemed to 
beam, 
fle cast a 
brilliant halo upon my minstrel's dream. 
Young Jerry, of the Bryants, too, with bones and tamborine, 
Recounted every great success in minstrelsy he'd seen, 
Billy Manning, of Chicago fame, then passed me swiftly by, 
And Unsworth gave his great stump speech, in which he the 
world defied; 
Jimmy Bradley danced his unequalled jig, familiar to us all, 
Billy Pastor sang his comic songs, and was many times recalled, 
Eph Horn, the last bright face I 
saw, he threw a 
radiant gleam 
Upon the spirits who had gone to fill my minstrel's dream

The Man that Knew the Actors. 
Written and sung by JOHN MCVEIGH. Dedicated to my friend H ARRY 
AlcAvoY. 
Of a 
queer young man I'm going to tell,. 
And every one of you know him well; 
He's rather a 
sort of a 
dizzy swell, 
The man that knew the actors. 
He knew every actor, both east and west, 
The highest, the lowest, the least, the best; 
In fact he would never give you a 
rest, 
The man that knew the actors. 
He knew Frank Girard, Charles White and Pat Rooney; 
When he spoke of Add Ryman he nearly went " looney." 
He knew both the Tonys, Pastor and Hart, 
And said he gave Harrigan his very first start. 
He knew John Wild, Johnny Shay and Bill Gray; 
And he knew Bill Thompson, wrote many a 
play. 
He knew Billy Barry as well as his mother, 
And Frank Bennett to him was as dear as a 
brother; 
Watson and Ellis he knew thoroughly well, 
And he put in the business John and Henry Kernell. 
He knew the Deveres, both Samuel and Billy, 
And he raised Cool Burgess, who knocked the " guys" silly, 
Gus Williams, he said, is a 
great friend of mine, 
" 
He eats nothing but birds, and drinks nothing but wine." 
Lew Simmonds and Richmond are two of his pards, 
And Sanford and Wilson enjoy his regards.

THE MAN THAT KNEW THE ACTORS. 
Continued. 
Billy Emerson and Newcomb are two of his friends, 
And to Schoolcraft and Coes his best wishes extends ; 
He knows Hughey Dougherty, and of him spoke well, 
And he lived in the same house with Senator Bell. 
Delehanty and Hengler, Harry Thompson and McKee 
Were many times out with him on a 
good " spree." 
He gave Charley Diamond his first lesson in music, 
And writes all the songs for Bill Morton and Gulick. 
He knows Backus and Wambold, and fat Billy Birch, 
They introduced him to Thatcher one day in a 
church. 
Billy Carter, Jaques, Kruger and himself are quite thick, 
He knows all the Nortons, including one they call Nick; 
Milt Barlow, George Wilson, and West and Primrose, 
Wouldn's lose his good will for a 
million of shows. 
He knows Larry Tooley, Joe Lang, and Ned West, 
And Cummings, and Harrington, his friendship attest. 
He knew Quilter and Goldrich, and old Walter Bray, 
In fact, he knows every actor in the country to-day. 
He knows people that were dead for ninety-nine years, 
And whenever he spoke of them he always shed tears. 
A Mick who was listening to him a 
couple of hours, 
Said: " Do you know a 
young man by the name of Ed Powers?" 
He said he did not—and could you suppose 
That the terrier thumped him square on the nose, 
Saying: `` Ye're a 
liar," as his ear he did eat, 
And made a 
kick at his neck as he ran in the street ; 
And now he knows no actor.

SKELLY. 
Sung by the BIG Foun,

New York. 
Last night I 
was out rathei late— 
'T was only an innocent spree— 
My wife for my coming did wait, 
When sleeping I 
thought she would be; 
I 
found her in temper and tears; 
" 
Oh," she cried, " it's a 
sin and a 
shame!" 
And she scratched both my eyes and my ears; 
But I 
told her I 
soon would explain. 
CHORUS.—The " 
Club " had a 
meeting to-night, love, 
Of bus'ness we had a 
great sight love; 
Don't think for a 
moment I'm tight,.love, 
I've only been down to the " Club." 
My boots I 
left down in the hall, 
And softly I 
crept up the stairs; 
I 
kept rather close to the wall, 
And thought to ascend unawares; 
But just as I 
got to the door, 
I 
seemed to get lost in the dark; 
I 
stumbled and fell on the floor, 
And just then I 
could only remark— 
Cnoiaus.—The " Club" had, etc. 
She sobbed and she wept and she screamed, 
And said she'd go back to her Ma; 
While I 
on the mantel- piece leaned, 
And tried to enjoy my cigar. 
I 
promised to buy her a 
dress 
If she 'd 
let me alone for awhile; 
Then I 
gave her a 
sweet little kiss, 
And I 
saw her beginning to smile. 
SPOKEN. —SO 
I 
thought it a 
favorable opportunity to 
assure her once more, as a 
positive fact, that—

Lively Micks from Keokuk, Iowa, 
Written by H UGH FAT. 
Here we are, two lively Micks, 
Sing and dance and full of tricks, 
We carry the mortar and the bricks, 
No matter where we go. 
A-working, down upon the levee, 
Where the work is light and heavy. 
Listening to the niggers sing 
And play the old banjo. 
It amuses us to see a 
nigger 
Try to cut a 
handsome figger, 
When he says he is the Pompey. 
Just from Arkansaw. 
Some of them are very brash, 
When they're out upon the mash, 
It's funny to John and James McGuffin, 
From Keokuk, Iowa. 
Every day, when our work is done. 
Then's the time we have our fun, 
We take a 
trip around the town, 
And get full of lager beer. 
Now, if with us you want to go, 
We'll take you to sweet Sligo, 
We're known as politicians 
In that part of the world. 
We're courting a 
gal, and she's a 
daisy ; 
Upon my soul, she's fat and lazy, 
If we don't marry her, she'll go crazy, 
Her name is Mary Ann. 
I'd sigh for her, I'd cry for her, 
Upon my soul I'd die for her.

That's when she goes for water at the epring,

It would haunt your lonely hours 
With happy thoughts of when you met 
My love among the flowers. 
She's the lily &c.

In elegant array, 
And scatters all the opening flowers, 
A compliment to May, 
With glowing joy my bosom beats,

And wish to see the various sweets 
In one sweet nosegay bound. 
CHORUS. 
'Tis granted, and the bloom displayed, 
The treasure it is found ; 
I 
see them all, my beauteous maid, 
In one sweet nosegay bound. 
The flowers blush and bloom each year 
The birds sing out their lay, 
The loveliness is in my dear. 
When I 
am far away; 
The roses blush whene'et she speaks, 
The lilies cease to bloom, 
The love which is but life to seek 
In one sweet nosegay bound.

TAKE IT BOB, 
Sung with immense success by MISS ALECIA JOURDAN, 
I'm a 
jolly young miller, Bob Bell is my name, 
And in my own village I'm well known to fame; 
I've a 
dear little sweet- heart, a 
nice little lass, 
I'm fond of her too, and I'm fond of my glass: 
Perhaps I'm too fond they say, that may be, 
I 
try to be merry, and am as you see; 
But if I 
attempt to refuse drinks a 
day, 
I 
fancy the wheel of my mill seems to say— 
Take it Bob, take it Bob, take it Bob, take it Bob, 
That's what I 
fancy my mill seems to say; 
Take it Bob, take it Bob, take it Bob, take it, 
Take it Bob, take it, its better than tea. 
I 
dreamt ' tother night that Bob Bell was no more, 
He died at the age—well, say twenty-four, 
And I 
heard the folks 'round me say, " drinks done its 
worst." 
And although I 
w 
as was dead, I 
was dying with thirst. 
A 
bottle of brandy close by I 
could see, 
'Twas meant for the mourners, It was'nt for me, 
And as on my bed still and silent I 
lay, 
In the distance distinctly I 
heard my mill say— 
Take it Bob, &c. 
Now I'm only up here for a 
bit of a 
spree, 
My Pa thinks its business between you and me, 
But you know the old saying that never deceives— 
What the eye does'nt see, the heart never grieves. 
I 
must toddle at once, so good-by to you all, 
Perhaps soon again I'll give you a 
call; 
Now don't ask me to drink before I 
go away, 
Or I'm certain to fancy I 
hear my mill say— 
Take it Bob, ite. 
Sung in `charagtet by Alvt-Es M ORRIS at Tony Pastor's Theatre, New York. 
On dusty road, mid city strife, 
No matter where we travel, 
The world's against the poor old tramp, 
He's everywhere a 
rebel. 
The farmer's wife denies him food, 
His very look speaks danger, 
Take pity on the poor old tramp, 
An outcast and a 
stranger. 
CHORUS. 
The house dog's barking at my heels, 
The watchman springs his rattle ; 
The lockup is my bed and board, 
I 
sleep on straw like cattle. 
My hat is old, my shoes well worn, 
My toes all laughing through them; 
My pant-legs crawling to my knees,/ 
No patches can renew them. 
My threadbare coat with buttons gone, 
Its tail has followed after ; 
Misfortune claims me as its own, 
I 
hear but jeers and laughter.

TRAMP'S LAMENT. 
Continued. 
Once I 
was young, and plenty filled 
The old red barn and byre; 
My mother's loving face I 
see, 
My brother, sister, sire. 
My father's manly form was bent, 
When years ago we parted, 
My wife and children all are gone, 
Behold me broken-hearted. 
The house dog's barking, &c. 
A 
burden on the town I've been, 
When years ago I 
counted 
My lands and houses by the score, 
With love and cheer surrounded. 
Misfortune came, no hand to help, 
I 
beg, I 
cannot borrow, 
The poor-house soon will be my lot, 
I 
care not for the morrow. 
The house dog's barking, &c. 
Kind friends, within your happy homes 
Where want ne'er casts a 
shadow, 
Take pity on the friendless tramp, 
Deal gently with his sorrow; 
Deny him not a 
crust of bread, 
That saving cup of water, 
Nor lose reward in store for those 
Who hope for joy hereafter.

Billy's Appeal to His Ma. 
Sung by PAT ROONEY. 
Presented to FIELDS and H ANSON. 
Give my boxing-gloves to brother, mammie, when I'm dead, 
When the sexton puts me under in my little bed; 
If the job is like to throw him when the string he jerks, 
Get some little boy to show him how the old thing works. 
[Repeat last line. 
Mamma, buy me a 
bran new Ulster, hire a 
Pullman car, 
Give me a 
bath of Florida water, I 
see the gates ajar; 
Give me a 
dose of paregoric—there's nothing about me mean, 
Give the sexton half a 
dollar to see that my grave's kept green. 
[Repeat last line. 
Give my chewing gum to sister, I 
don't want it any more, 
On my lips it raised a 
blister that was awful sore ; 
Sing to me the Last Rose of Summer—mamma, don't you cry, 
For in the clouds I'll raise a 
racket, in the sweet by and by. 
[Repeat last line. 
Sprinkle my body with powdered sugar, smear me over with 
tar. 
Cover my form with peacock's feathers—I 
want to be an 
angel, ma; 
2,et me bite the old torn cat's tail off, she can't ketch no mice, 
Let me go bathing with the girls—it's naughty, but it's nice.

Good-Tempered Man. 
and sung with tremendous success by the great and only 
HARRY RICHMOND, the refined comic vocalist. 
What a 
pity to hear some people declare 
That life is a 
burden of sorrow and care; 
I've lived forty years in this valley of tears, 
And of troubles I've had a 
full share, 
And I 
find it is wiser to laugh than to cry, 
And merrily sing if you can; 
Clouds that are dark may clear by-and-by, 
So laugh like a 
good-tempered man, 
Ha! ha! ha! 
I 
was always a 
good-tempered man. 
My courting I 
paid to a 
fair pretty maid, 
When I 
asked her to wed she lovingly said, 
" 
Dear Daniel it's true I'm faithful to you, 
Believe me and don't be afraid." 
But in less than a 
month her promise she broke, 
And off with another she ran; 
I 
laughed and treated it all as a 
joke, 
For I'm such a 
good-tempered man. 
Ha! ha! ha! 
Oh, I'm such a 
good-tempered mart. 
A mob in the street I 
happened to meet, 
A 
thief with a 
snatch ran away with my watch, 
My hat with surprise was knock'd over my eyes, 
Crying" Stop thief," the people all ran, 
But I 
never moved an inch from the spot, 
But to laugh and to dance I 
began, 
To think what a 
guy at that moment I 
look'd, 
Oh I'm such a 
good-tempered man. 
Ha! ha! ha! 
Oh! I'm such a 
good-tempered man. 
Then never give way to that demon dismay, 
If to- day you are down and acquaintances frown 
To-morrow may bring quite a 
different thing, 
And life's but a 
flash in the pan. 
If care, as they tell us, once killed a 
pocr cat, 
Though scarcely believe them I 
can, 
Like me you are bound to get jolly and fat, 
If you laugh like a 
good-tempered man. 
Ha! ha! ha! 
I 
was always a 
good-tempered man.

I AM getting old and feeble now, I 
cannot work no more, 
have laid the rusty-bladed hoe to rest, 
O'd Massa and old Missus they're sleeping side by side, 
And their spirits are now roaming with the blest; 
Things are changed about the place, the d 
rkies all am gone, 
And I 
cannot hear them singing in the cane, 
And the only friend that's left me is that little boy of mine. 
In my little old log cabin in the lane. 
There was a 
happy time to me not many years ago, 
When the darkies used to gather round the door, 
They used $o 
sing and dance at night, and Play the old banj,‘, 
But alas, they cannot do it any more; 
The hinges are all rusty now, the door is tumbling down, 
And the roof lets in the sunshine and the rain, 
Oh! the only friend that's left ma is that little boy of mine, 
In my little old log cabin in the lane. 
BOY. 
Oh! daddy, don't you be so sad and melancholy now, 
For you there's many happy days in store, . 
Although you're old and feeble, your boy is young and strong, 
And will love and cherish you for evermore;

I'se longing for the good ole times we used to hab of yore 
When we labored in de cotton and de corn, 
And eb'ry night de darkies gather'd 'round de cabin door 
To de calling ob de mellow bugle horn; 
We would dance and we would sing to de banjo's happy ring, 
De ole fiddle and de bones made music too, 
And eb'ry charming yaller gal would to her lover cling, 
While all our hearts were honest, kind and true.

While all our hearts were honest, kind and true. 
Our ole massa used to like de fun and laugh'd to see de reels 
Dat the boys and girls were always sure to dance, 
And when the " picaninny nigs" would turn upon dar heels 
De ole man would join dem in dar merry prance; 
Tho' he used to give us blows when among de cotton rows, 
He was kind to us when daily toil was o'er, 
And eb'ry one dat worked upon the old plantation knows 
His heart was bigger dan our sunny shore. 
(Chorus). 
We have heard he joined de army after sending us away 
And was killed in battle down in Tennessee, 
And some one else has told us dat dcy heard ole missus say 
lie was sleeping 'neath de ole Palmetto*tree; 
H 
de last report is so, all of us would gladly go 
And shed upon his grave a 
friendly tear, 
For eber since we left him we have felt the keenest woe, 
Dar's nothing for de worn out darkey here.

don't think there's any body hurt, 
For the pig only weighed five pounds. 
I 
sell my meat the whole day long, and when at night I'm done, 
I 
dress myself all in my best, and then go out for fun, 
The white tolks shake their heads at me, and say I'm mighty 
big, 
But I 
tell them that it came from, that little five pound pig.

Courting Cards.— This Series of Cards has been arranged 
to meet a 
want frequently felt by young people—a 
want of means of 
expressing one's sentiments in such a 
way as to be non-committal. 
Many young ladies are visited by 
ntlemen who are either too diffi-
dent or too fearful of a 
repulse, to venture upon asking the momentous 
question. The lady is restrained, by custom and a 
sense of propriety, 
from doing anything that would seem to be an unladylike encourage-
) 
ment. As a 
result of this dilemma, many lives are spent as an unloved 
tedious existence, which mighthave been prolonged and enjoyed in the 
happiness of matrimony. This pack of Cards will overcome the diffi-
culty, and being in the shape of questions and answers, will cover every 
phase of courtship. 
The sentiments conveyed therein need not be 
adopted by the parties to the game as their own, unless it accords with 
the state of their affections, which fact makes a 
further explanation un. 
necessary. The playing of these Cards is not restricted to two players, 
but may be enjoyed by evening parties

panied with directions so plainly written, that, with 
a 
single perusal, any person may become an. adept 
in an unfailing source of amusement. 
Read what a leading Journal says of it: 
" 
An ingenious little book of the thaumaturgic order 
has been sent us, called HUMPTY DIIMPTY,' and bound 
in such a 
way as to give opportunity for a 
decidedly 
puzzling trick. 
While presenting the ordinary appear-
ance of a 
child's picture-book, gayly printed and colored, 
it is so bound that a 
practiced manipulator, taking it 
up, and flirting the leaves rapidly over, can make it ap-
pear to be filled with copies of only one picture, or with 
blank pages, or with any one of quite a 
succession of 
figures. 
One minute the pamphlet, quickly thumbed, 
appears to contain nothing but portraits of Harlequin, 
in his tesselated suit; the next, only Columbine; then, 
nothing but Pantaloon, or Riding Hood, or Mephisto-
pheles. A little practice, and the directions printed 
with the book will make anybody at .home in the hand-
ling of it."—Phila. Evening Bulletin.
