Introduction. Jerome "Jerry" and Ian Flesher, Flesher Corporation. Interviewed June 3, 
2017, at the Roslyn Hotel, Roslyn, New York. Interviewed by Jeanne Drewes, librarian.

History: Line of foil lettering machines for letter books, book covers, and cloth for book 
covers.  Company established in 1974, incorporated in 1975.  It was a small mail order 
business for ham radio products, and Jerry continued this business for several years.  An 
engineer from Topeka, KS contacted Jerry for a control system for one of the machines at 
Brackett Stripping Machine Co.  Across the alley was American Bookbindery, who also 
had an Automark machine in need of a control system, which Jerry replaced.  Jerry 
started retrofitting 1930s and 1940s era machinery for the bookbinding industry.    
  
  
00:02:34 
Interest in Industry:  Ian was born within months of the company incorporating, and 
spent time playing in the shop as a child. The first "shop" was their detached garage in 
Topeka, KS.  When the business moved downtown, Ian and his brother would walk to the 
shop after school to hang around and get a ride home.  The company was incorporated at 
the same time Microsoft and Apple were started, and Jerry was soon using the same sorts 
of integrated circuits and technologies that the early computer companies were working 
with, but applying them to the ancient craft of foil lettering. 
 
Jerry's interest in the bookbinding industry was a matter of taking advantage of an 
opportunity that was presented to him.  He had been a ham radio operator since the age of 
13 and always loved taking things apart and putting them back together, largely self-
taught. 
  
  
00:05:10 
Mentors: Jerry's first mentors were twin brothers, Jay and Kay Schaffer, ham radio 
operators who built their own equipment.  Jay was a programmer for Apple in the early 
1980s.  John DeMand, the engineer at Bracket Stripping Machine, taught Jerry about 
designing machines and using machine tools to make parts. 
 
Ian's mentor was Jerry.  He's nostalgic for the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s, even into the 1980s 
when an entrepreneur could have a great idea, apply technology to it, and figure out a 
marketable solution.  Those days are gone. 
  
  
00:07:42  
Growth of Business: Jerry demonstrated the control system he had developed for 
American Bookbinding to members of the library binding industry at one of their 
meetings in Topeka, and Jack Fairfield said, "I'll take two!"  On site visits to retrofit other 
binderies' equipment led to discussions with the binders about other needs, where the 
industry was going, etc., and Jerry got a feel for the next applications to develop.  This 
lead to the System 2.  John DeMand and Jerry hired Jack Fairfield as a consultant to 
explore in depth what machinery was needed for the library binding industry, and John 
and Jerry built a prototype of the System 2.  Jerry has never applied for a patent, because 
it was an application of existing technologies to a particular industry.  He also didn't feel 
that someone could come from the outside and compete. 
 
The prototype was built for American Bookbinding whose owner, Dick Crawford, 
believed in Jerry and paid the cost of developing the prototype.  Jerry could bring other 
binders into American Bookbinding to see the prototype at work, but the other binders 
couldn't look around at the rest of the operation.  This was 1978 or 1979. 
  
  
00:14:22 
Career: When the production version of the System 2 was completed, Jerry drove to the 
LBI meeting in Florida with the machine in the back of a truck, set it up in his hotel 
room, and impressed the membership with the small size of the equipment and cool 
operation compared to the equipment they were accustomed to.  A non-LBI member 
heard about the machine and showed up in Florida to see a demonstration, but Jerry was 
instructed that he could not demonstrate the machine to a non-member at an LBI event.  
Jerry's solution was to leave the hotel room door open and post the non-member outside 
the door to listen to his demonstration for someone else. 
  
  
00:16:57 
Associations: The LBI was a defendant in an anti-trust lawsuit.  Dudley Weiss, an 
attorney in Boston, was hired to defend the organization and won.  He eventually became 
the executive director of the LBI.  The Fleshers describe the price-fixing component to 
the LBI in those times, based on word-of-mouth accounts.  Dudley Weiss wrote a book 
called My Years with LBI:  a Personal History. 
  
  
00:19:49 
Changes in Business over Time: The methodology of designing machines has changed.  
Once worked with pencil and draft paper, drafting machines.  Now it's computer design 
in 3-D models.  Originally drawings on paper were converted to prototypes and 
adjustments were made based on the prototype's performance; now the testing can be 
done with the 3-D modelling and the machines built are production models. 
 
Ian worked for his father, on and off, over the years, but tried to avoid working for him.  
About eight years ago, he realized that it made sense to work for Flesher and was able to 
engage with the business.  His understanding of modern computer technology has been 
an asset to the company; current software is increasingly sophisticated.  In the 1980s, the 
company's business was library binding; now it's 10% of the business.  Other applications 
are photo albums, yearbooks, anything you can stamp on.  The yearbook business was 
helped by pressure from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to stop using lead 
type and linotype machines.  Their advertising slogan was, "Get the lead out!" 
 
The business has benefitted from a confluence of factors:  technology development, 
personal relationships, the EPA, and production industries' drive for efficiency. 
 
 
00:28:00 
Building and Plant: As noted earlier, the company started in the detached garage, and 
the size and location of the production facility have varied over time with the volume and 
nature of the products.  Jerry started a spin-off business for the sheet metal and machine 
parts needed.  The two companies share production space and can expand and contract as 
needed in a 3000 square foot space, capable of delivering several machines per month. 
 
 
00:29:43 
Technology:  There are currently several machines in development, sometimes for just 
one customer.  They are somewhat victims of the quality of their products, so durable that 
they are still performing well at 30 years old.  The software they run on is increasingly 
incompatible with current computer technologies; some components have not been made 
for fifteen years.  They are now developing retrofits for their own machines.  A large part 
of the business is service and support.  The future of their business is tailoring solutions 
to specific markets. 
 
 
00:38:16 
Regrets: They developed their own business management software designed for their 
needs (inventory management, production management, purchasing and sales 
management, all fully integrated), but by the early 2000s, it was outdated.  Jerry regrets 
not developing their in-house software for a broad market and upgrading it to keep up 
with current technologies. 
 
 
00:41:12 
Greatest Accomplishment: No one achievement stand out for Jerry.  Ian feels that 
making something elegant is what an engineer takes pride in, and that accomplishment 
isn't always known by customers.  They just appreciate that it works. 
 
 
00:43:45 
Changes to Industry: When Jerry started working with Automark machines in binderies 
in the 1970s, there were a lot of binderies with five or fewer employees.  They have all 
disappeared through consolidation.  Personal relations with the owner of the small shop 
who did the work are now contacts with managers who don't necessarily work out on the 
bindery floor, much more of a business relationship.  Ian feels that LBI is a dying breed 
because of the personal relationships developed among competitors.  There is less of a 
priority in business in general on employing people and bettering their lives.  Flesher's 
product was once a solution to the problem of too much work to accomplish with 
available people and equipment; today's business world is only looking at efficiencies 
and reducing costs. 
 
 
00:50:03 
Interesting Projects: Jerry created a machine to foil stamp lettering on the spines of 
rounded books using 3-D computer aided design.  Ian worked on automating 
personalized content in yearbooks for Jostens; the project failed for Jostens, but Flesher's 
machine performed perfectly.   
 
 
00:54:37 
Advice to Next Generation: Ian observes people with a good idea today who think 
they're going to develop it and become wealthy, but he's skeptical that there are the same 
opportunities to do this now as there were when his father started his business.  Jerry 
warns engineers against the perfect being the enemy of the good, and also taking pleasure 
in problem-solving only and never making a viable product.  Good ideas don't matter 
without good business sense.  Ian feels the foundation of business is still trust and 
personal relationships.  Jerry has balanced his time between business and doing things 
that he enjoys and has no regrets over some lost revenue because of that.
