PRETTY LITTLE SARAII 
SONGSTER 
Pretty Little Sarah, or $7 a Week. 
My heart is like a 
pumpkin, swollen big with love. 
For one of the fairest girls in creation; 
She is too good for me, though I 
am far above 
The drudgery and ill-paid of my station. 
Her father keeps a 
butcher-shop, on the Harlem 
road; 
For this little virgin, ot love I've got a 
load: 
I've spent a 
fortune on her; but of that I 
only 
speak: 
For, what a 
fortune I 
must have on Seven dollars a 
week I 
CHORUS. 
Pretty little Sarah, lovely golden hair, 
Her beauty jealous maidens will be 
scorning; 
She ought to be an angel, and if only 
rich I 
were, 
I'd marry her so early in the morning. 
The first time that I 
met her, 'twas in the pouring 
rain, 
I 
proffered her my arm, and umbrella;

Pretty Little Sarah, 
She looked with a 
smile; I 
said I'd see her home; 
She thanked me with a 
-voice so low and mellow. 
When we arrived at home, she said she'd ask me in, 
But her parents they were poor. 
Said I: Poverty's 
no sin. 
No doubt she thought me rich, but of course I 
didn't speak. 
For 
was doing my heavy on Seven dollars a 
week. 
Pretty little Sarah, &c. 
She's got a 
little ankle, she's got a 
little foot, 
And pretty little fingers running taper; 
Her waist is round and small, her mouth.is best of 
all, 
With ruby lips not twice as thick as paper; 
She's always dressed in silks, her notions they are 
high; 
Although her features small, her bearing's in the 
sky. 
When she belongs to me, of course, I 
never speak 
What lots of siik she'll get from me on Seven dol-
lars a 
weeiz. 
Pretty little Sarah, &c. 
Her parents they are poor, but she's a 
milliner, 
And earns large wages in the city : 
Some she gives her mother for her keep and board, 
The rest she spends on clothea to make her 
pretty. 
She never saves a 
cent, though to me she says she 
will; 
To pay the expense of marriage is a 
sugar-coated 
pill; 
And should we have a family—but too soon I 
must not speak— 
A 
wife and fourteen children on Seven dollars a 
week!

Oh, ho! oh, ho! to Nicodemus Johnson. 
My master was a 
Union man, 
He did not like Secession: 
And so he had to leave de old plantation; 
I 
thought to stay behind him there, 
'Twould be an aggravation: 
Oh, ho! oh, ho! to Nicodemus Johnson. 
I's glad dis war come to an end, 
And peace come frew de nation; 
I'll go right back to Dixie's land, and stay dar; 
For I 
isn't any contraband, 
I 
love de old plantation:

Pretty Little Sarah, 
Yet he wooed, he wooed and won her, 
Thrilled her gentle heart with care: 
Then he heeded not her weeping. 
He cared not her life to save ! 
Soon she perished— now she's sleeping 
In the cold and silent grave! 
Lady, turn not . from me so coldly; 
For I 
have only told the truth ; 
From a 
stern and withering sorrow, 
Lady, I 
would shield thy youth : 
I 
would shield thee from all danger— 
Shield thee from the Tempter's snare; 
Lady, shun the dark-eyed stranger: 
I 
have warned thee—now, beware 
Take your gold—I 
do not want it: 
Lady, I 
have prayed for this— 
For the hour that I 
might foil him, 
And rob him of expected bliss. 
Aye, I 
see thou art filled with wonder 
At my looks so fierce and wild : 
Lady, in the church-yard, yonder, 
Sleeps the Gipsy's only child! 
Do Not Heed Her Warning. 
ANSWER TO THE GIPSY'S WARNING. 
Lady, do not heed her warning, 
Trust me, thou shalt find me true; 
Constant as the light of morning 
I 
will ever be to you. 
Lady, I 
will not deceive thee, 
Fill thy guileless heart with woe ; 
Trust me, lady, and believe me, 
Sorrow thou shalt never know.

Lady, every joy would perish, 
Pleasures all would wither fast, 
If no heart could love and cherish, 
In this world of storm and blast; 
E'en the stars that gleam above thee, 
Shine the brightest in the night; 
So would he who fondly loves thee, 
In the darkness, be thy light. 
Down beside the flowing river, 
Where the dark-green willow weeps, 
Where the leafy branches quiver, 
There a 
gentle maiden sleeps; 
In the morn, a 
lonely stranger 
Comes and lingers many hours— 
Lady, he's no heartless ranger: 
For he strews her grave with flowers. 
Lady, heed thee not her warning, 
Lay 
thy .soft white hand in mine: 
For, I 
seek no fairer laurel 
Than the constant love of thine. 
When the silver moonlight brightens, 
Thou shalt slumber on my breast, 
Tender words thy soul shall lighten, 
Lull thy spirit into rest. 
Champagne Charlie. 
I've seen a 
deal of gaiety throughout my noisy

With all my grand accomplishments, I

For, Champagne Charlie is my name, 
Champagne Charlie is my name, 
Good for any game at night, my boys, 
Good for any game at night, my boys : 
Who'll come in and join me in a 
spree ? 
The way I 
gained my title is by a 
hobby which 
I've got 
Of never letting others pay, however long the 
shot ; 
Whoever drinks at my expense, are treated all the 
same: 
From Duke 3 
and Lords, to cabmen down, I 
make 
them drink Champagne. 
For, Champagne Charlie is thy name, & c. 
From coffee and from supper-room, from Poplar 
to Pall-Mall, 
The girls, on seeing me, exclaim : Oh! what a 
Champagne swell 
The notion 'tis of every one, if it were not for ray 
name, 
And causing so much to be drunk, they'd never 
make Champagne. 
For, Champagne Charlie is my name, &c. 
Some Epicures like Burgundy, Hock Claret, and 
Moselle, 
But Moet's vintage, only, satisfies this champagne 
swell.

go, and head is muddled

bottle, in the morning, sets me right then very 
quick.

blowing, 
And the Spring-time grass was fresh and green; 
And the birds, by the brooklet, their sweet songs 
were singing,

first met my darling Daisy Deane. 
CHORUS. 
None knew thee but to love thee, thou dear one 
of my heart; 
Oh! thy memory is ever fresh and green: 
Though the sweet buds may wither, and fond 
hearts be broken, 
Still I 
love thee, my darling Daisy Deane. 
Her eyes soft and tender, the violets outvying, 
And a 
fairer form was never seen : 
With her brown silken tresses, her cheek like the 
roses, 
There was none like my darling Daisy Deane. 
None knew thee but, &c. 
The bright flowers are faded, the young .grass has 
fallen, 
And a 
dark cloud hovers o'er the seen : 
For, the death-Angel took her, and left me in 
sorrow 
For my lost one, my darling Daisy Deane.

None knew thee but, &c.

Mamma! do come here for a 
moment, 
Such fun, oh! I 
surely shall die; 
The Major's just gone, and, what think 'ye, 
All the morning did nothing but sigh. 
Oh, he is such a 
dear fellow, 
And, you know, has plenty of gold; 
Besides, he has made me an offer, 
But I 
wish he was not quite so old. 
CHORUS. 
Oh dear Pm quite in a 
hurry, 
Where's Papa, Henrietta, and Rose? 
They'll scarcely believe when I 
tell 
The Major came here to propose, 
But now, dear Mamma, just consider 
How very delightful 'twill be, 
The clothes and the jewels he'll give me, 
And the sights he will take me to see. 
To-morrow at half-past eleven, 
He will come, let it snow, hail, or rain. 
When he's promised to bring me a 
present— 
A 
beautiful gold watch and chain. 
Oh dear, & c. 
There's Lord Henry Grey, and Sir Edward, 
How highly annoyed they will feel; 
For now I've accepted the Major, 
They'll sometimes come short of a 
meal;

really can't think how I've caught him, 
What a 
fortunate girl I 
must be; 
But I 
made up my mind I 
would have him, 
The first time he came here to tea,: 
Do you know I 
had nearly forgotten, 
Dear Mamma, wnat you told me to say, 
About ten thousand pounds he must settle 
On me on my wedding day. 
Oh dear, S.;c. 
Now, Mamma, pray do order the carriage, 
Indeed, I 
mast go for a 
drive; 
I'm determined to call on the Gordons,

And then we will come back to dinner, 
And afterwards go to the play, 
Where, perhaps, we shall meet the dear Major, 
To finish this fortunate day.

Pretty Little Sarah, 
The world it is a 
bitter one, 
And govern'd still by gold; 
But love in woman's breast begun, 
Clings like the ivy's fold. 
Her heart is pity's pure domain, 
Her home an Eden fair; 
For every human grief and pain 
Sweet woman has a 
tear. 
A Friend in Distress. 
Oh! if there's a 
pleasure on earth that's more 
pure, 
Or more blest than another, say is it not this— 
To lighten the sorrows that others endure? 
To hold out a 
hand to " A 
Friend in Distress?" 
'Tis a 
pleasure that selfishness never can know, 
A 
joy that no language. no pen can express, 
Ah! who can forget, that has once felt the glow 
That the heart gives while helping " A 
Friend in 
Distress ?" 
Since each has his trials and troubles to bear, 
While as pilgrims we journey along the same 
road, 
When we meet with a 
brother with more than his 
share, 
'Tis " humanity" bids us to " lighten his load. 
The richest to-day may to-morrow be poor, 
If we've little, how many there are who have 
less; 
Oh! when should the heart then, the hand, or 
the door, 
Be closed to the claims of " A Friend in Dis-
tress ?"

My Dream is of Thee. 
My dream is of thee when the sun's golden beam 
Is sparkling at morn over the mountain and 
stream, 
And flow'rets just waken'd are lifting their heads, 
And spangled with clew from their moss-cover'd 
beds. 
I 
hear thy sweet voice in the lark's joyful lay, 
And fancy thou'rt with me wherever f 
stray: 
Thus all things seem lovely on earth, air, and sea. 
For life's varied scene forms one bright dream of 
thee. 
My dream is of thee when the sun's ling'ring ray 
Sheds the last twilight gleam of the fast fading 
day, 
When sweet violets droop and the heather bells 
close, 
And nature by Zephyrs is lull'd to repose; 
And softly the notes of the nightingale's song 
Are breathing thy name as they murmur along; 
Thus all things seem lovely in earth, air, and sea, 
For life's varied scene forms one bright dream of 
thee. 
The Hours I 
pass'd with Thee. 
When sunlight glides the eastern sky, 
Alone I 
love to roam, 
And watch its deep 'fling lustre dye, 
The sparkling ocean foam, 
For oh 1 
at that sweet tranquil time, 
My thoughts far backward flee; 
I 
muse upon the joyous hours, 
The hours I 
pass'd with thee.

I 
muse upon the happy hours, 
The hours I 
pass'd with thee.

When husbands interfere; 
What right have husbands to intrude? 
They have no right, that's clear. 
Besides, what conduct is so bad, 
Whcn you'd the question pop, 
They must really think the ladies mad, 
To prefer a 
husband to a

To a

We ne'er again may roam, love.

And around our childhood's home, love,

And that joyous smiles, alas! love,

The Lost Child. 
By Tom. H OOD. 
One day, as I 
was going by 
That part of Holborn christen'd High, 
I 
heard a 
loud and sudden cry, 
That chill'd my very blood. 
Out from a 
court, like one posest, 
A 
woman ran with heaving breast, 
She turn'd her east, she turn'd her west, 
And then bounced through the mud. 
At length her pent up frenzy 'gam to reach 
That boiling point just capable of speech; 
And with a 
cry as wild as ocean bird's, 
With loud exclaim she gave her sorrow words: 
" 
0 
Lord! oh dear! my heart will break! I 
shall 
go stick, stark, staring ! 
Has ever-a- one seen anything like a 
lost-looking, 
crying child ? 
Lawk help me! I 
don't know where to look or run, 
if I 
only knew which way, 
But a 
child as is lost in the Seven Dials, is like a 
needle in a 
bottle of hay. 
CHORUS. 
Oh! will no one tell me where he's gone? 
My bursting heart with grief is torn, 
I 
wish I 
never had been born,! 
I've lost, I've lost my child!

Pretty Little Sarah, 
two blessed motherly eyes, 
Sitting, as good as gold, in the gutter, a-making 
of little dirt pies. 
Why should he leave the court, where he was 
better off than all the other boys? 
With two bricks, an old shoe, nine oyster shells, 
and a 
dead kitten, by way of toys. 
Oh ! will no one tell me, etc. 
" 
Do, good people, move on! and don't be staring 
like a 
parcel of stupid stuck pigs! 
Saints forbid I 
perhaps he's inveigled up a 
court 
for the sake of his clothes, by the prigs ; 
He'd got on nearly all his best, and they wasn't so 
very much tore, 
His jacket and breeches cost eighteen-pence, but I 
shan't see them nor him any more. 
Oh! will no one tell me, etc. 
"He's got on a 
very good pinafore with two slits 
and a 
burn on the breast, 
But his shirt, it's lucky I'd in the wash-tub, or it 
might have gone with the rest. 
He'd a 
goodish sort of hat, if the crown was sow'd 
in, and not so much jagg'd in the brim. 
With one shoe on, and the other's shoe's a 
boot, 
and not a 
fit, and you'll know it by that, if 
it's him. 
Oh! will no one tell me, etc. 
" 
And if I 
called him a 
beauty it's no lie! but only 
as a 
mother ought to speak ; 
I 
never set eyes on a htindsomer face, only it 
hasn't been wash'd for a 
week. 
As for his hair, though it's red, it's the nicest hair 
when I've time just to show it the comb. 
I'll owe him five pounds and a 
blessing besides, as 
will bring him safe and sound home.

He's blue eyes, not to be call'd a 
squint, though 
a 
little cast he has got, 
And his nose is still a 
good un, though the bridge 
is broke by falling over a 
pewter pint pot. 
Oh! I'd give the wide world, if the world was 
mine, to clap my two longing eyes on his 
face ; 
He's my darling of darlings, and if he don't come 
back,, you'll see me fall dead in this here 
place ! 
Oh! will no one tell me, etc. 
" 
I 
only wish I'd got him safe in these arms, oh! 
wouldn't I 
hug and kiss him ; 
I 
never thought how precious he was, but a 
child 
don't feel like a 
child till you miss him. 
Why, there he is! Punch and Judy hunting, the 
young wretch, it's that Billy as certain as 
sin ; 
But just let me get him by the scruff of his neck, 
and I 
won't leave a 
whole bone in his skin. 
" 
Oh ! you little varmint, aint I 
riled! 
But saints be praised ! I've found my child; 
With joy I 
shall go almost mild, 
I've found, I've found my child. 
I've found my child, I've found my child, 
I've found my child, I've found my child."

Should prove, e'er misfortune has past, 
As cold as the winds moaning round thee,

Though just turned of sixty was she; 
He ask'd her the price; soon a 
bargain he struck, 
Then he ogled her charms, and he called her sweet 
duck, 
While she cast a 
sheep's eye, blest her stars for 
suchluck. 
Hey diddle, &c. 
Thus under her roof, she'd a 
true lover got, 
Hey diddle, ho diddle, he, 
But soon he turn'd out a 
most terrible sot,

Still with this consola tion she ne'er went in quest,

to rest, 
And when brim-full of spirits she liked him the

Are waves that ebb and flow. 
Beb old the Happy Home.

Pretty Little Sarah, 
Chalk-and-water came a

Vowed he loved me. 
His love was in the " milky way." 
No bright star was he; 
His words were like butter, 
But the cream of this joke, 
He stuttered and stammered 
Whenever he spoke. 
I 
was as, .8:c. 
A 
good milk walk he had, 
His custom was good, 
To marry him directly, 
Asked me that I 
would; 
I 
answered immediate, 
Don't talk such stuff, 
For me, Mr. Sky Blue, 
You're not good enough. 
I 
was as, Sze. 
The man I 
shall marry, 
Must have plenty of gold, 
Both young and handsome, 
And tremendous bold; 
He sobbed and he cried, 
As he did depart, 
Like unto butter, 
You've melted my heart. 
I 
was as, 8:c. 
So the chalk-and-water milkman, 
So it does appear,

Recollections of Youth. 
Fond memory loves to dwell upon 
Youth's gay and buoyant powers; 
And all our pleasure is when gone, 
To say in after hours: 
"'Twas here my chiklhood's days were spent, 
When my young heart was free 
From sorrow, care, or discontent,-
Gay joys encircled me." 
When wrinkled age creeps o'er the frame, 
And all life's joys are fled;

On youth and bygone days, 
When pleasure with her varied hues, 
Spread forth her flowing ways. 
But threescore years, the man who sees, 
All hope of joy has lost, 
For summer's sun, or zephyr's breeze, 
Come not with winter's frost, 
So youthful joys in age depart, 
Of all he is bereft ; 
And the fond memory of the heart, 
Is all that's to him left.

And at Tin and his chests of tea,

And, to settle his debts, one day 
Sold him his daughter's hand.

You are going far away, far away from poor Jean-
nette, 
There's no one left to love me now, and you, too, 
may forget; 
But my heart will still be with you, wherever you 
may go. 
Can you look me in the face, and say the same, 
Jeannot ? 
When you wear the Jacket red, and the beautiful 
cockade, 
I 
fear that you will then forget the promises you've 
made: 
With your gun upon your shoulder, and a 
bayonet 
by your side, 
You'll be taking some proud lady, and be making 
her your bride. 
Where glory leads the way, you'll be madly rush-
ing on. 
Never thinking if they kill you, my happiness is 
gone : 
Should you win the day, perhaps a 
general you'll 
be, 
Though I 
should be proud to hear it, what will 
become of me? 
Oh! were I 
Queen of France, or, still better, Pope 
of Rome,

All the world should be at peace; and if kings 
would show their right, 
I'd have those that make the quarrel, be the only 
men that fight.

Of those who had sought their aid.

Then, say what you will, we'll drink to them still,

The Ivy that Grows on yon old Abbey Wall 
The ivy that grows on you old abbey wall, 
A 
type of affection should be, 
Enduring and constant, whate'er may befall, 
As thou, love, hast been unto me. 
Clasped firmly forever, while time steals away 
The flow'rets and blossoms so fair, 
Its leaf-like affection contented to stay, 
And bloom still an evergreen there. 
Round the old abbey wall will that ivy branch 
More firmly as seasons shall roll, 
And so should affection be strengthened by time, 
Still binding more closely the soul. 
And thus, when the summer of life shall depart, 
And winter come chilly and bare, 
The smile of affection will gladden the heart. 
And bloom still an evergreen there.

Surprised that Mrs. Lirriper for me did wait: 
At night, when returning, she usually . smiled, 
Like a 
tigress on this night she looked precious 
wild. 
That something occurred had, 
Plain was to be seen, 
At Mrs. Lirriper's lodgings on Camberwell Green. 
Said she, sir, the housemaid left me to-day, 
Never dreaming that she was in a 
delicate way; 
This evening in my bed-room I 
heard a 
strange 
noise, 
In my bed I 
discovered two living fine boys 
No followers I 
would allow, 
None ever were seen, 
In Mrs. Lirriper's lodgings on Camberwell Green 
Her Sundays out regularly she had, 
Nor was I 
aware that a 
sweetheart she had, 
But what's to be done, sir? Said I, do not fret 
The best thing to do is a 
nurse now to get, 
The twins were both smiling, 
In the sheets white and clean, 
At Mrs. Lirriper's lodgings on Camberwell Green. 
The next day on leaving her, she said, sir, pray

Have pity upon me and father the two,

Wandring on through smiles and tears.

Pretty Little Sarah, 
Coming Back Again. 
Yes, there she 
sat 
i
n her 
lonely 
cot, 
In sadness and i
n t
ears, 
And hope grew faint as time sped on, 
Her eye, once bright, was dim; . 
The pallid cheek too plainly told, 
The deep despair within; 
And often to her throbbing breast, 
Her only child she'd strain, 
And teach his little lips to lisp--
Oh ! speed himlack again. 
But now, how changed the little cot, 
How cheerly beams her eye, 
And smiles again play round the lips 
That ne'er had ceased to sigh; 
For she had heard a 
joyous tale, 
A 
tale that told of peace, 
That banish'd sorrow from her side, 
And bid all wailing cease. 
She told her boy, with tears of joy, 
That fell like summer rain, 
The war is o'er, thy father, child, 
Will soon be back again. 
She thought upon the happy time 
When seated by her side, 
He'd tell the tales of battles won, 
With all a 
soldier's pride; 
And then her heart pour'd forth its thanks, 
To him who many a 
night, 
She'd pray'd to guard her husband through 
The dangers of the fight; 
And that oft uttered earnest prayer, 
To him is not in vain, 
The war is o'er, her husband's safe, 
And coming home again.

Hopes like mine can never soar; 
If the love I 
cherish changes, 
It will be to love thee more, 
Though the world has many sorrows, 
And perchance they may be ours, 
Love from tears a 
brightness borrows, 
Like the earth from summer showers 
We will share our grief and gladness, 
In the future as of yore, 
And in all your hours of sadness, 
Dearest, then I'll love thee more. 
Youth may pass, but ask not whether 
When you're old I'll love as true; 
Shall we not grow old together, 
And Time's changes mark me too? 
Life may cease, bat then to heaven 
Will my pure affections soar, 
Yet, when freed from earthly leaven 
Dearest, then I'll love thee more.

And the west wind sigh'd o'er the lea,

house in Union Square, once there lived a 
cook, 
On my vegetables passing, she would always look, 
And she gave me such a 
very loving wink, upon 
the sly, 
When she bough4
., my onions, turnips, cauliflowers. 
Those sly wink 3 
that she gave me, I 
could under-
stand, 
And when paying me a " tickler" squeezing of 
the hand, 
Out of town was all the family, and cook was left 
behind, 
With the upper housemaid, just the house to 
mind; 
One morning she invited me, that night to come 
to tea, 
Masaniello: or, the Fisherman's League. 
Details the uprising of the furious lazzaroni with wonderful vigor.

Pretty Little Sarah, 
The offer I 
accepted, which pleased her, I 
could 
see, 
And she gave me such a 
very loving wink, upon 
the sly, 
As she paid for onions, turnips, cauliflowers. 
I 
went, then, in the evening, dressed all in my 
best, 
The muffins and the sassengers I 
put away with 
zest. 
To a 
theatre after tea, I 
invited them to go, 
The housemaid answered in a 
pet, for rue I 
thanb 
you, no; 
I 
looked upon the cookey, and the cookpy looked 
on me, 
As in the sugar basin, she was pouring the tea, 
The housemaid said, why cook, you are thinking 
on the sly, 
Of Sam, his onions, turnips, cauliflowers. 
They were chattering very cosy, on love and other 
things, 
When the nouse-bell of a 
sudden, tremendously it 
rings. 
Goo,dness gracious, said the cook, as she rose from 
r by ny side, 
It's the master and the missus, wherever will you 
hide ? 
Oh, Sam, get in the pantry, where the butler keeps 
the plate; 
Don't stir a 
blessed peg, for me to let you out must 
wait. 
I 
was wishing, as she put me in the pantry on the 
sly, 
I 
was crying onions, turnips, cauliflowers. 
The pantry being dark, I 
was groping all about, 
smashed two china vases, when cook began to 
shout;

The butler rushed towards the door, opened with 
the key, 
In the twinkling of a 
jiffy, tight he collared me, 
Who are you? What brings you here ? The plate 
would steal ? said he. 
I 
looked for cookey to explain: no cookey could I 
see, 
A 
policeman locked me up, said for a 
stall I 
went 
Around the squares with onions, turnips, cauli-
flowers. 
The magistrate committed me, for trial I 
was sent, 
Six months work they gave me under government. 
The cook and upper housemaid never knew me, 
both did swear, 
For a 
moment couldn't think however I 
got there ; 
So, gentlemen, you plainly see, how they served 
me out, 
So, peddlers, all I 
have to say, mind what you are 
about: 
Never heed the winking of cooks' eyes on the sly, 
When selling onions, turnips, cauliflowers.

For neither ever fades away, 
Unladen with delight.

Why Chime the Bells so Merrily? 
Why chime the bells so merrily? 
Why seem ye all so gay? 
Is it because the New Year's come, 
And the Old has passed away? 
Oh! can ye look upon the past, 
And feel no sorrow now, 
That thus ye sing so joyously, 
And smiles light every brow? 
Oh! if ye can be blithe and gay, 
The song troul gaily on, 
And the burden be the New Year's come, 
And the Old Year's gone. 
The old man gazes on the mirth„ 
He smiles not like the rest, 
He sits in silence by the hearth, 
And seems with grief oppressed;

Can we with apathetic soul, 
I Look on an Eve like this, 
And drown our senses in the bowl— 
Ordained for hearfelt bliss ? 
No, from our memories ne'er can leave, 
Youth's happy joys on Christmas Eve. 
Uncle Tom's Dream. 
"In dreams a 
gentle voice came over his ears: he was 
sitting on the mossy seat, in the garden by Lake Pontchar-
train, and Eva, with her serious eyes bent downward, was 
reading to him from the Bible."— Uncle ruin's Cabin, ch. 32. 
She comes again in dreams to one of earth, 
Weig,h'd down by sorrows bitter, 
sad, 
and 
deep— 
She comes in visions to which mind gives " ,irth, 
Bright, happy thoughts that calm his t;•oublecl 
sleep. 
What words of comfort stealing o'er his mind! 
He seems to hear in soft and gentle tone, 
!lead from his treasured book, and he shall find 
Those promised joys shall for his grief atone. 
Those tender words, they seem to melt and fade 
Like heavenly echoes; slowly they depart, 
Yet to the sleeper they have lent their aid;' 
Of warmth and comfort to an aching heart; 
But now she seems to rise on shining wings 
To higher spheres, and from his dream is gone; 
While he who wakes finds sorrow round him clings, 
He knows amid the crowd he's yet alone. 
The Heir at Law; Cr, the Victim of Crime. 
Pull of intricate entanglements and mysterious plottings.

Why Throbs this Heart with Rapture New 
"Why throbs this heart with rapture new? 
What joy is this till now unknown? 
In accent3 soft while he did sue, • 
E'en Nature's self seemed lovelier grown, 
When at my side the evening gale, 
More gently did the flowers move: 
Some spell doth sure my sense assail 
A 
power unseen, can it be Love? 
Why sinks my heart now he is gone? 
Why sad and cheerless feel I 
now ? 
The night winds sigh more sad and lone, 
More chill the breeze plays o'er my brow; 
His voice yet rings within mine ear 
Like music wafted from above, 
Nought else o'er seemed to me EO dear, 
Ah, much I 
fear this must be love!

1 
No. 1. TILE DERIONO_F' THE 
DESERT. This book is one of the 
most powerfully exciting novels ever 
written. The scenes are laid in South-
ern Texas—the land of the rifle, the 
tomahawk and the 
scalping knife. 
Strange and terrible adventures crimson 
almost every page. 
No. 2. PRAIRIE PETE; or, 
The Trappers Avenger. 
Of 
all the tales of wild adventure in forest 
sod prairie this is the most excellent. 
The reader seems to actually hear the 
yell of the demon red skins, sees their 
painted faces, and witness the lurid 
flames of the frontier log cabin. 
No. 3. 
WILD BILL; THE 
INDIAN SLAYER. Wild Bill 
who is an inveterate hater of the In-
dians, was also chased by six Indians 
lately, and had quite a 
little adven-
ture with them. 
Taught by long 
practice with Indians to be always on 
his guard, he never walks out of the 
house without a 
brace of fine revolvers 
slung to Isis waist but on an important 
errand, he goes armed to the teeth—and 
woe to the Indians who cross his path. 
So. 4. THE 
DEATH 
TRAIL; 
or, The Feathered Arrow. 
Vividly are these pages filled with the 
doings of the terrible Regulators of 
Arkansas, (the antet vpes of the Vigi-
lance Committees of California.) 
Some 
of the incidents are fearfully terrific, 
such as the vigil of the Indian by 
the corpse of his a 
ife, and his awful re-
venge upon her slayer, in the ruined 
wigwara. 
This book depicts characteristically 
many incidents of border life, and vivid-
ly portrays the villa° ies practised in ear-
i 
lier days n 
the Valley of the great Mis-
sissippi. 
cz- For Sale by all News Dealers; or, sent, POST PAID, to any ad-
dress, on receipt of 
price, TEN CENTS. 
No. 5. GREY-EYED LUKE; 
or, The Pirates of the Savan-
na. Every page of this thrilling book 
is 
full of incident—every paragraph 
leads the reader rapidly on to the cul-
mination of the most interesting plot 
that author ever conceived. The char-
acters are exceedingly natural, and all 
their actions life- like and full of daring 
and vigor. The hot sun of Sonora fills 
their veins with fiery resolution and ex-
cites them on to deeds of desperation. 
No book of its class can begin to coin-
' 
pare with it, 
No. 6. SIX-SHOOTER 31111; 
or, The Bandit' of the Woods. 
This book will find readers as long as 
there exists a 
taste for the wild, the ter-
rible, and the sanguinary. It is a 
truth-
ful pieturo of real life- but life as it ex-
ists upon the frontiers of civilization, 
where that potent engine of war, the 
revolver, meets the rifle, the tomahawk 
and the scalping- knife. Every one who 
has grossed the plains without having 
Isis " hair lifted," will acknowledge the 
truthfulness of these striking scenes, 
that read as if they had been written by 
the lurid blaze of burning cabins with a 
pen dipped in blood. 
No. 7. THE WRECKER'S 
VICI'IH; or, The Demons 
of the Coast. This Story is terrible 
interesting. 
It details some of the most 
surprising events afloat and ashore ever 
depicted. 
The daughter of the iron-
hearted smuggler and wrecker is ono of 
the loveliest maidens that ever pressed 
foot on sea-sand. Her adventures are 
many among the ruffians that surround 
her—ruflians more cruel than the awful 
waves that dash on the wreck- strewn 
shore by which eke lives. This book Is 
as full of life and action as the tempest-
tosses! billows upon whirls the smug-
gler's daughter was cradled,
