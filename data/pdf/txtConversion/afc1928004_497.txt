BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH 
—OF— 
Wm. A. FITTNTLEY-, 
The Classic Banjoist of the World. 
This gentleman the subject of our sketch was born in the 
city of Providence, R. I. 
his first appearance upon the stage 
was in 1860, with M:iad's Minstrels, at New London, Conn., 
under the managem,mt of Dr. George W. Huntley, with whom 
he afterwards joine 1 
the Campbell & Huntley's Minstrels, re-
maining with them for a 
number of years. 
In the fall of 1868 
he opened a 
Banjo Academy, at Providence, R. I., where he 
continued to teach upwards of two years, giving banjo socials 
once a 
week, which were attended by the elite of the city. 
Here it was where he made himself master of that instrument, 
and to-day stands second to none as a 
performer upon the 
same. 
In September. 1871, he opened at the 
Howard 
Atheneum, Boston, for a two week's engagement, being 
honored with a 
very flattering reception. 
During the two 
months following he traveled with Lauri's Pantomime Troupe, 
visiting the New England States, Canadas, and the British 
Provinces. 
In the latter part of the same year he joined the 
Martinetti Ravel Pantomime Troupe for a season of ten 
months, visiting all the principal cities and towns as far South 
as Texas, and as far West as Wisconsin. 
In the spring of 
1873 he joined McKee & Rogers' Combination for a 
short 
season; afterwards rejoining the Martinetti Ravel Troupe. 
At a 
very early age he manifested an unusual taste for music, 
being his own instructor on a 
variety of m-sical instruments, 
and has since become a 
very fine compose), having published 
a 
great number of the most popular songs of the day. 
He 
has justly been styled the unrivalled banjoist of the age, being 
the first to discover its musical powers, to bring forth all its 
potent melody, and to give it a 
high rank among musical in-
struments. 
Mr. Huntley has been received with great enthus-
iasm, being the recipient of many very complimentary notices 
from the press. 
He is not only a 
fine musical composer as 
well as a 
superb instrumentalist, but is also possessed of a 
beautiful tenor voice, and renders the popular ballads of the 
day with marked effect. 
For several years Mr. L itley 
has been playing star ertrr,acTements in all the principle the-
atres throughout the United States, being everywhere re-
ceivd, with a 
perfect ovgioll,

Composed by WILLIAM A. HuNTLEv, and sung by JENNIE MORGAN 
Take me back to home and mother, 
I 
am weary wand'ring here, 
There can never lie another 
Spot on earth so dear to me. 
Thou0 I 
roam ' mid scenes of splendor, 
Vet my heart is filled with pain, 
And a 
longing, sad and tender, 
Whispers take me back again. 
CHORUS. 
Take mc back to home and mother, 
For my heart is filled with pain, 
Take me back to home and mother ; 
Only take me back again. 
Take me back to home and mother, 
To the happy scenes of yore, 
Friends of childhood, sister, brother, 
Long to welcome me once more. 
I 
can hear their voices ringing, 
In sweet memory's refrain, 
To the past my heart is clirging, 
Only take me back again. 
Take me back, &c. 
Take me•back to home and mother, 
Gentle words will greet me t 
here, 
For on earth there is no other 
Kindness like a 
mother's care. 
Life is but a 
dream of pleasure, 
Sweetest hours must turn to pain, 
'Tome is all I 
have to treasure, 
Only take me home again.

Take me back, &c.

When the Purple Lilacs Blossom. 
When the purple lilacs blossom, 
Shall we, dearest, meet again ? 
Will the robin and the bluebird 
Greet us with a 
sweet refrain? 
In the soft and gentle twilight, 
Where we often, love, have met, 
You will tell me, little darling, 
If you dearly love me yet. 
CHORUS. 
In the soft and gentle twilight, 
Where we often, love, have met, 
You will tell me, little darling, 
If you dearly love me yet. 
When the daisies dot the meadow, 
Shall we, dearest, meet again ? 
Will the summer zephyr kiss us 
When we wander down the lane? 
Long ago we met and parted 
In the golden pasture, bright, 
And since then, my little darling. 
Time has quickly taken .
flight. 
In the soft, & c. 
When in heaven witii Cie angels, 
S 
iall we, dearest, meet again ? 
Will we climb the hill together 
To th2 land that knows no pain? 
In that home no wail of sorrow 
Breaks the pure and loving heart, 
And I 
hope, my little daring, 
There we'll meet to never part.

Down Among the Daisies. 
Composed by W M. A. 
H UNTLEY, and sung by the W IIITINGS—CHARLES 
and ANNIE. 
Down among the daisies, by a 
little stream, 
Where the silver waters softly glide, 
Making sweetest music in the mellow gleam 
Of the sunbeams dancing on the tide. 
There I 
meet my darling every summer day, 
While the leaflets nodding up above 
Are the only ones that list to what we say, 
As we whisper o'er our tale of love. 
CHORUS. 
Down among the daisies, by a 
little stream, 
Where the waters ripple soft and low, 
Sitting with my darling, in a 
happy dream, 
Heedless of the hours that come and o. 
Down among the daisies, some one says to me, 
Oh, I 
love you better than my life ; 
Some one softly answers— in the days to be 
May I 
hope to win you for my wife? 
Many solemn vows are whispered there and then, 
Many words are spoken soft and low ; 
'Tis the same old story whispered o'er 
New to us as in the long ago. 
Down among the daisies, & c. 
Down among the daisies we will ever dwell, 
In a 
little cottage by the stream ; 
Nought shall ever come to break the happy spell, 
Break the golden glimmer of our dream. 
Joys may come and go, like flowers that droop and die, 
But as long ag life shall brightly gleam, 
We v 
ill chug together, darling, you and I, 
Down among the daisie, by the stieam. 
Down among the daisies, & e.

CUI:Nt ios , 
cf Cern-
cross Minstrels. 
hush, m: little darling, hush thee, 
Dry those tiny eyes so red, 
And perhaps your worthy father 
Will to- night bring home some bread. 
Hard he's labor'd in the fact'ry, 
But he cannot get his pay ; 
And, to make it more distressing, 
All the mills have closed to- day. 
CHORUS. 
Hush, my little darling, hush thee, 
- 
Papa cannot get his pay ; 
But to- night he'll bring you something, 
Tho' the mills have closed to-day. 
Hush my little darling, hush tht.e, 
Check your hunger for aw hilt , 
Try to bear the burden lightly, 
Substitute for tears a 
smile. 
Do not let your courage falter, 
For I 
heard your papa say 
That his darling should not suffer, 
Tho' the mills have closed to- day. 
Hush, my little darling, tle. 
Hush, my little darling, }Irish thee, 
Try and do the best you can ; 
And your father will sustain you, 
Like an honest working man. 
Tho' he cannot get the money 
That is due him, let us pray 
Fm relief from other sources 
Than the mills that closed to-day. 
Hush, my little darling, & c. 
When the Birds Have Gone to Sleep. 
Composed and sung by WiLuaTst A. HuNTLEY. 
When the roses bud and blossom 
By the rippling river side, 
Where they gently nod and listen 
To the music of the tide ; 
While the early stars are shining, 
In the far-off azure deep, 
Come to meet me, clearest darling, 
When the birds have gone to deep. 
Come to meet me, dearest darling, 
Where the shadows softly creep, 
In the calm and peaceful twilight, 
When the birds have gone to sleep. 
How I 
long to hear you whisper 
All the story of our love, 
With nobody very near us 
Save the leaflets up above, 
Sweetest words to thee addressing, 
Loving arms around me creep, 
Could we evermore thus linger 
When the birds have gone to sleep. 
Come to meet me, &c. 
Your Pocket-book's Your Friend.. 
Composed by WILLIAM HUNTLEY. and sunQ by 1-1ARny 
As we iourney along up the hill-side of life, 
How seldom we well comprehend 
The guide board that teaches in misery or strife, 
Our pocket-book's always our friend. 
You may travel this wide world from shore unto shore. 
But you'll find ere you've half reached the end 
That man's object is gain and to add to his store— 
His pocket-book's always his friend. 
CHORUS. 
Yes, friends near you gather forever in life, 
But on this you may always depend : 
That in sunshine or storm and in peace or in strife, 
Your pocket-book's always your friend. 
Standing there in a 
crowd is a 
poor orphan girl 
That woman of fas'lion who sneers, 
Wears a 
mask on her face, and her life's brightest pearl 
Shines out through her sorrow and tears. 
Bless'd with fortune and friends, she now hurries by 
Refusing assistance to lend. 
The poor orphan shudders, and exclain with 
sigh 
Your pocket-book's surely your friend. 
Yes friends near you gathe, &C, 
YOUR POCKET-BOOK'S YOUR BEST FRIEND. 
Continued. 
A 
story DI tell, and I'm sure it is true, 
To me by ct good man ' twas told: 
A 
bank vault was entered by burglars, who knew 
Where they kept all their treasures and gold. 
Now wealthy was one, the other was poor; 
The poor man to prison they send, 
While the rich thief gets clear, and the motto sure, 
Makes his pocket-book his best friend. 
Yes, near friends you gather, &c. 
You remember of reading a 
murder report— 
A 
noble, kind man was shot dead. 
The assassin was caught, and brought into court, 
Found guilty, at last, it was said. 
Now the punishment' death for a 
crime of the kind, 
But tc hang him they didn't intend, 
For his wealth saved his life, and stern justice was blind ; 
His pocket-book proved his best friend. 
Yes, near friends you gather, & c. 
Now remember me, boys, as you iourney along, 
This friend whom you ne'er knew before, 
Will always prove faii:iful, and keep you from wrong, 
And banish the wolf from the door. 
Dark clouds of misfortune will o'ershadow the sky, 
But on this you may always depend: 
When grim poverty comes then we cannot deny, 
Our pocket-book's always our friend, 
Yes, near friends you gather. &c.

A 3-1. 
UNTLEY, and sung by D AVE W AMBOLD, of the 
San Francisco Minstrels. 
I 
must leave you, love, to- morrow, 
Leave you here, to roam afar, 
And it gives me pain and sorrow, 
Since I've learned how dear you are. 
Well I 
know you'll not be near me, 
As I 
wander to and fro ; 
So, to comfort and to cheer me, 
Kiss me, love, before I 
go. 
CHORUS. 
Sweetest thoughts of thee I'm keeping, 
Smiles of thine should brightly glow ; 
Can I 
go and leave yon weeping, 
Kiss me, then, before I 
go. 
You will sit here in the gloaming, 
As you have so oft before, 
But you'll wait in vain my coming 
To the little cottage door. 
For ' mid other scenes and pleasures 
I 
shall wander to and fro; 
If your heart keep mine in treasure, 
Kiss me, love, before I 
go. 
Sweetest thoughts, &c. 
You may never sit beside me, 
Never hold my hand again ; 
Yet your sunny face will guide me, 
In the sunshine, in the rain. 
Where on earth I 
chance to wander, 
Still a 
memory sweet and low, 
Of the faded past I'll ponder— 
Kiss me, love, before I 
go. 
Sweetest thoughts, &C..

Kiss Me, Mamma, Kiss Me. 
Just to Please the Boys. 
Composed by W N1. A. 
H UNTLEY, and sang by ELLA M AYO. 
Some people have peculiar ways, and I 
have some, I 
know, 
I 
don't like swell society, restraint I 
cannot go ; 
I've done and will do as I 
please, keep still or make a 
noise, 
I 
love to please the ladies, but prefer to please the boys. 
SPOKEN.—Oh, well, ladies never appear perfect in each 
other's eyes 
there's always some little fault, whether caused 
by envy, jealousy, or otherwise. 
So, on this occasion I 
waive 
female opinion and intend— 
CHORUS. 
Just to please the boys, 
just to please the boys ; 
I 
always meant, with good intent, 
To try and please the boys. 
I 
love to sing, to sail, and race, I 
love to skate and dance, 
And I.)ve all social parties where they give a 
girl a 
chance ; 
My lady friends find fault because they cannot share my joys, 
And tell me I'm too forward when I 
try to please the boys. 
SPOKEN.—Yes, whenever I 
try to entertain a 
gentleman, I 
hear such exclamations as these : " Ain't she awful?" " How 
exceedingly fresh !" " She will never catch a sensible hus-
band." 
And all this because I 
try— 
Just to please the boys, & c. 
Some people call me fickle, just because I 
change my beau, 
And don't keep one man to myself, and let all others go ; 
Now tilat, I 
think, would be unkind, for no one more enjoys 
To give good-looking men a 
chance, and try and please the 
boys. 
SPOKEN.—Lord ! 
I'm not fickle. 
I 
do like one man. The 
other evening a 
gentleman kissed me just because I 
let him. 
He repeated the act, and then wanted an encore. 
I 
refused. 
He said, " Ella, they all do it." 
He didn't mean me. I 
have 
a 
few kisses left, and when I 
distribute them it will be— 
Just to please the boys, &c. 
Composed by Wm. A. H UNTLEY, and sung by J. S. 
KELLY, of C2rncrss' 
Minstrels. 
" 
Kiss me mamma, kiss me, 
For I 
am going to sleep," 
Reechoed through the boat's saloon 
That night upon the deep. 
The little one who spoke the words 
Was merry, sweet and fair, 
And with a 
loving sister kind, 
They were an angel pair. 
CHORUS. 
" 
Kiss me, mamma, kiss me, 
For I 
am going to sleep," 
Reechoed through the boat's saloon 
That night upon the deep. 
" 
Kiss me, mamma, kiss me, 
For I 
am going to sleep," 
Are word; that stirred the strongest hearts, 
That made the tender weep ; 
And when the sinking " Metis " fought 
The surging billows high, 
How painful must have been the sight 
To see the darlings die ! 
' 
Kiss me, mamma," & c. 
" 
Kiss me, mamma, kiss me, 
For I 
am going to sleep," 
Was a 
presentiment most true 
That night upon the deep; 
Though none had thought the coming morn 
They'd perish in the waves, 
Or tnat the little ones so soon 
Would sleep in silent graves. 
Kiss me, mamma,' & c. 
412; 
As sung by FRANK LEWIS with immense applause. 
One day I 
took a 
walk, rambling tiff°. the Central -Park, 
It was at the close of a 
bright Autumn day, 
To enjoy the evening breeze as it swift sped thro' the trees, 
And watch the fountain's water brightly play. 
After walking once around, a 
rustic bench I 
found, 
And sitting down a 
moment just to rest, 
When a 
voice I 
heard above, saying 
Soon to you I'll prove 
That honesty of purpose is the best. 
As I 
looked up with surprise, a 
strange s,ght met my eyes, 
Some fifty sparrows gathered o'er my head; 
A big cock sparrow spoke, with age his feathers broke, 
And this was what the old cock sparrow said. 
"'Tis strange such things to hear, we are getting worse each 
year, 
The laboring man now cannot get a 
meal, 
About fifty cents a 
day is all they earn for pay, 
It's no wonder that the poor man has to steal. 
And our parsons do Lot preach, or longer virtue teach, 
At secret kissing they are most expert; 
And our politicians all for their living shout 
A 
bawl, 
And talk of nothing but that bloody shirt. 
And our lecturers who roam, like naughty men from home, 
Through sleeping cars in dreams be blindly led, 
Like Tilton, sweet to furl his arms ' round seine pretty girl!" 
This was part of what the old cock sparrow said. 
"To the cleinagogues who dare talk again of civil war, 
On the Fourth of March ' twill be all right, I 
say. 
Boss Tweed is back again front that dirty land called Spain, 
And I 
hope that in confinement he'll not stay. 
For. supposing he did rob, no p( or man wanted a 
job, 
Ic took it from the rich to k;iv e 
the poor! 
I'd rather run the risk, be ruled by men like him and Fisk, 
For then no beggars hungered at your door. 
Of such things soon well tire, look at the great Brooklyn fire; 
They condemned the theatres—when the folks were dead! 
Had they done it but before, we should not the fire deplore"— 
This was part of what the old cock sparrow said. 
"In the election long since gone, none knows which man has 
won, 
They did the " counting" just themselves to please: 
Let Returning Boards act fair, and do things on the square, 
And we care not if it's Tilden or it's I 
Eaves. 
But one thing we must see, in this land so great and free, 
That work in plenty shall be got for all; 
And the scoundrels who would lower the wages of the poor, 
How quickly we will send them to the wall!" 
At this a 
shout did rise, which ascended to the skies, 
From the sparrows that did flutter o'er my head ; 
They said his words were right, as they flew into the night, 
And they voted all the old cock sparrow said.

SOME people are so very fond of Newport, 
While others like to go to Cape May, 
While some prefer to go to Saratoga, 
And sonic at home like to stay ; 
Some like to do the lakes and mountains, 
And some like to go upon the sea, 
But I 
wouldn't give a 
dollar for the lot, boys, 
Long Branch is the place for me. 
Cuoncs. 
For I'm called Long Branch Joe, 
No matter %viler° I 
go. 
I 
am a 
nubby, festive sport, 
As you can plainly see, 
As I 
promenade around 
En that famous Summer town, 
Everybody knows me 
As Long Branch Joe. 
I 
take an omelet and some coffee in the morning, 
Then I 
promenade about as I 
please, 
Then I 
call to see a 
friend down at the cottage, 
Atid enjoy a 
quiet smoke among the trees, 
The I 
take a 
stroll down on the sands, boys, 
And watch the darling ladies take a 
splash, 
Then I 
get my sorrel horse and buggy, 
To drive up and down the beach to make a 
dash. 
For I'm called, etc. 
At six o'clock- I 
toddle off to dinner, 
And afterwards a 
game of billiards play, 
TI mu I 
flirt a 
little out on the verandah 
With a 
captivating Miss across the way ; 
At nine o'clock, of course. the ball -room opens, 
And if for dancing I'm inclined to go, 
I 
always get the very best of partners, 
For the girls all like to dance with Joe. 
For I'm called, etc. 
As originally sung by Goss and Fox. 
We'll lock dat lion's jaw, 
We'll lock dat lion's jaw, 
We'll lock dat lion's jaw, 
When we get on Canaan's shore, 
Little children can't you hold on, hold on, 
-We'll get home by and by, 
Little children can't you hold on, hold on, 
We'll get on Canaan's shore, 
Sunday morning, 
Hold your light, Monday morning, 
hold your light, Tuesday morning, 
Hold your light on Mount Calvary. 
Hold your light, Monday morning, 
Hold your light, Tuesday morning, 
Hold your light on Mount Calvary. 
We'll hold old Jonah down, 
We'll hold old Jonah down, 
We'll hold old Jonah down,

We'll get home by and by, 
Little children can't you hold on, hold on,

Originally sung by VIRGINIA STIOKNET. 
Now the song I'm going to sing to you, 
And what it is about, 
If you give me your attention, 
You will quickly find it out, 
'Tis about the cutting affairs of life, 
A savage subject but, 
'Tis none the less a 
true one—for, 
All nature has to cut, 
First the darling little baby, 
Cuts its darling little teeth, 
And the doctor cuts its little gums, 
To soothe its little grief, 
And when its a 
little older, 
It begins to cut up jack, 
Then its mama cuts a 
little switch, 
And cuts its little back. 
Now the butcher cuts your mutton chop., 
The cook cuts up your hash, 
The tailor cuts the dandy's coat, 
The dandy cuts a 
dash; 
The circus clown cuts capers, 
The ring master cuts the clown, 
And then he cuts the horses up, 
To make them go around. 
All the Dolly Vardens cut a 
swell, 
When they go on the street, 
Their shoes are cut so very small, 
They cut their pretty feet. 
Should you tell them that it cuts your heart, 
To see them cut up so, 
They'll give you a 
cutting look and say, 
Now you just cut and go. 
Now employers cut your wages down, 
Sudi cuts you do not like, 
So you quickly cut away from work, 
And cut on; on a 
strike, 
There are love -nits and business cuts, 
There's cuts of every kind, 
Even little boys can't steal a 
ride, 
Without its cut behind, 
But of all the many -alts of life, 
The unkindest cut of all, 
Is the cut an old friend gives you, 
When misfortunes on you fall, 
But there's a 
cut we all must feel, 
Before we end the strife, 
'Tis when death comes to close the seen*, 
And cuts the thread of life.

A 
SHILLING OR TWO,

Composed by H. W. FITCHETY. 
Published by E. H. HARDING, 229 Bowery, opposite 
Prince St., N. Y. 
Price 10 cents. 
This is trash I'm writing, 
And yet still it is true, 
That each mortal is fighting 
For a 
shilling or two. 
And, pray, what crime is so great, 
That is known unto you, 
As this to be rather short 
Of a 
shilling or two? 
CHORUS. 
A 
shilling or two, a 
shilling or two, 
'Tis fearful to want a 
shilling or two; 
This wicked world you can never get thro', 
Lest you're possessed of a 
shilling or two. 
Now, if you your friends would try, 
There's but one thing to do, 
Just ask them to lend you 
But a 
shilling or two. 
And you will find your sworn friends 
Turn their backs upon you, 
For it is dreadful to want 
Just a 
shilling or two. 
CHORUS. 
A 
shilling or two, a 
shilling or two, 
Friends car be bought for a 
shilling or two; 
Yes, yes, it is true you'll find it is true, 
Friends can be sold for a 
shilling or two. 
Now, pray, do girls wed for love? 
Well, p'rhaps some of them do; 
But they mo ,c 
often do wed 
Just a 
shilling or two. 
But mind, most men are the same, 
But their folly they rue, 
Because real joy is not bought 
For a 
shilling or two. 
CHORU3. 
A 
shilling or two, a 
shilling or two, 
It oft proves a 
curse, a 
shilling or two; 
Young maidens are bought, and young men sold, too, 
And all for what—just a 
shilling or two. 
Perhaps you may think it saange, 
Yet still it is true, 
I'm singing these few lines 
For a 
shilling or two; 
And I've not been back-biting, 
For search the wide world thro', 
And all men you'll see fighting 
For a 
shilling or two. 
CHORUS. 
A 
shilling or two, a 
shilling or two, 
Wonderful charms has a 
shilling or two; 
It buys things on earth, that's all it can do, 
But heav'n's not bought for a 
shilling or two.

In June he wore an overcoat, to guard against the storm,

He never rode in coach or cab, for fear the horses kicked ; 
He always sewed his pockets up to stop their being picked. 
He was a 
careful man, & c. 
He always eat quite sparingly, for fear that he'd get stout, 
And had his bed made on the floor, for fear that he'd fall out; 
He never knew the time of day— it may appear a

And he never would wind up his watch, in case he'd break

•He rarely lived in one place long—his nature was to roam— 
At last he went to Brooklyn, and has since made that his

They soon induced him to become the parson of their church. 
He was a 
careful man, & c. 
He preached on every topic, and it was his constant aim 
To astonish his congregation and earn himself a 
name. 
Now, not long since he thought he'd go and see New York 
by night, 
So he took two detectives along with him to show him all the 
sights. 
He was a 
careful man, & c. 
He saw so much of loveliness, and of beauty frail but fair, 
And a 
handsome young creature

blonde 
with golden hair; 
But for fear that he'd be

She loved him with all her true heart •, 
But Kitty, I

She said he had come much too soon, 
She would not stay out o'er five minutes

THERE'S a 
little white cot that is dearer than life, 
Where I

Where I 
carry no thought of the world's eager strife, 
When I 
enter its low humble door. 
Oh ! the smile of a

And I 
hear all the children's glad tone, 
This earth has no treasure more sweeter to me, 
Than the dear little home of my own.

in my dear little home. 
Oh ! when ever I 
roam from this little white cot, 
In the hurry and noise of the day, 
My heart gladly turns to that heaven-like spot, 
And I 
long to its shelters to stray. 
And I 
long for the touch of a 
hand on my brow, 
For a 
dimpled one round my neck thrown, 
While the hours wanders by so wearisome now, 
Far away from my dear little home. 
I've a

At the close of the day in the twilight so sweet,

I 
think of the many that roam; 
No place for a

Isn't a 
Dollar enough to buy Bread, and 
Water costs Nothing at all. 
An original song by FRANK LEWIS, written for HARRY 
W OODSON. 
In the city of Brooklyn is living 
A 
man, who himself once was poor, 
But that fact it would seem he's forgotten, 
Or he'd act very different, I'm sure; 
Now I 
heard, on a 
late Sunday morning, 
These words from his saintly lips fall— 
"Isn't a 
dollar enough to buy bread? 
And water costs nothing at all." 
Cnonus. 
Then no man will I 
count in the list of my friends, 
Who is deaf tc the workingman's call; 
And says—" A 
dollar is enough to buy bread, 
And water costs nothing at all." 
This wonderful preacher don't do much, 
Tho' he lives on the fat of the land, 
He has all that he wants—maybe too much, 
For he lives in a 
style that is grand; 
Yet this clerical and cheeky old fraud said— 
(Though two thousand a 
month is 
is pay,) 
That a 
workman should be very happy, 
On only a 
dollar a 
day. 
Then no man, etc. 
This man is not known for his goon deeds, 
Though for " gab " the world own* lies famed, 
He preaches to please his rich pati•ns, 
And thereby has gained a 
great name; 
But I 
d 
much rather be a 
poor workman, 
When before judgment's seat we all stand, 
Than to be in the shoes of Ward Beecher, 
Who went back on the poor laboriugman. 
Then no man, ets. 
DOREN'S THE ACTOR. 
Written by BOBBY NEWCOMB, and sung with great su c(ss by 
W ILL. H. 
MORTON, With HARRIGAN & HART'S COMbh17,t1C-, 
(New version.) 
The theatre was full, it was Dorkins' night— 
That is, Dorkins was going to play, 
A 
character new to himself and the stage 
That he'd trod for so many a 
day. 
By eight the theatre was perfectly jammed, 
All awaited a 
pleasant surprise, 
For they knew they would laugh till their sides would ache, 
And they longed for the curtain to rise. 
The play soon began, each neck was stretched forth, 
And eagerly watched each eye 
For Dorkins to make his first entrance, and then 
To give him a 
cheerful Hi, Hi! 
He soon appeared amidst loud applause, 
But something was wrong you could see 
Why Dorkins is playing quite badly to- night, 
The people said sitting around me. 
A 
hiss? yes, it was ; I 
saw Dorkins start, 
As though stumg by a 
serpent's fang, 
Then he cast a 
beseeching look all around, 
And his head on his breast did hang. 
Some said he was drunk, and I 
thought so myself, 
For to me it was awful at times. 
To see how he'd struggle along with his part, 
And continually stick in his lines. 
At last he the footlights then slowly approached, 
And ladies and gentlemen said, 
Believe me, if I 
cannot please you to- night, 
The faults not the heart but the head; 
Many a 
time I 
made you all laugh, 
When I 
was scarce able to stand, 
And every effort was pain to me then, 
Yes, if I'd raise but my hand.

Don't Forget to be Kind to the Boys. 
Written expressly for LITTLE BOB by BEN DODGE. 
There is something which I 
wish to mention to you, 
While trying to please with my song. 
Some solid advice unto you I 
will give; 
Please listen its not very long. 
Your attention I'll call to the poor little boys 
You will meet on the street every day. 
Do not spurn them aside with a 
curse or a 
kick, 
When by chance they are thrown in your way. 
CHORUS. 
Don't think they're too small to be noticed at all, 
Let them share in your sorrows and joys. 
Their love will repay your kindness some day, 
Don't forget to be kind to the boys. 
If a 
poor boy accosts you while trying to earn ; 
By honest means but half a 
dime, 
If you have it to spare, buy a 
paper at once, 
Or invest when he proffers a 
shine. 
He has loved ones at home who upon him depend ; 
For the poor crusts of bread which they eat; 
And the brave honest boy to provide them with food, 
Has to labor each day in the street. 
Don't think they're too small, &c. 
The greatest of statesmen were once small like me, 
And no one can tell what's in store 
For a 
boy in the future if upright he proves, 
No matter if now he is poor. 
So unheeded don't pass the advice which I 
give; 
But by your applause let me see, 
That you promise to ever be kind to the boys, 
And I 
hope you'll begin here with me. 
CHORUS 
Don't think I'm too small to be noticed at all, 
But kindly give me your applause. 
My love will repay your kindness some day, 
Don't forget I 
ani one of the boys.

When we meet again at home ? 
Shall I

See your bright and happy smile, 
And, far better, hear you whisper— 
"I have loved you all the while!"

Her father keeps a 
farmhouse, in a 
village down in Kent, 
And lieing on my holidays, to spend them there I 
went; 
Arid while a 
strolling tlirough the fields, as on my way I 
roamed, 
It's there I 
met my Nelly, as she drove the cattle home.

Nelly Ray, &c. 
I 
took my Nelly for a 
walk, among the bright green gras., 
And words of love I 
whispered to this young country lass, 
I 
placed my arms around her waist, as I 
sat by her side, 
And while we were a 
talking she pledged to be my bride, 
Nelly Ray, &c. 
And now we've named the happy day, and how happy we 
shall be, 
No thoughts of jealousy shall enter the minds of her or me; 
But in our farm-house we'll be happy night and day, 
And our lives shall pass like sunshine, for I 
have the brightest 
ray.

Used to frolic one and all,

In that little cabin home in South Caroline. 
We used to get up in the morn, 
Before the break of day, 
And go off singing to our work 
In the cotton fields away. 
And when night came we'd sing and dance 
And on the banjo play, 
In that little cabin home in South Caroline. 
CHORUS. 
But these happy days are past and gone many years ago, 
My eyes are growing weak and dim, my steps are getting slow, 
And the time am drawing nearer now in which I'll have to go 
From that little cabin home in South Caroline.

Her style was great— could not be beat-

I 
walked right up and took a

By this nice young girl from Harlem. 
I 
spoke and said I 
meant no harm, 
She carried a 
book upon her arm, 
She said her father owned a

This nice young girl from I

She said she was going to meet her pa, 
Her little brother and dear mama, 
She was " giving me taffy" and " tra-lada-la," 
This nice young girl from Harlem. 
We left the car and took a 
cruise, 
I 
swore this gal I'd never lose, 
Bought lager beer and seventeen stews 
For this nice young girl from Harlem. 
In about two hours she got her fill, 
Then asked me to loan her a 
ten dollar bill, 
Said she'd come back— but I'm waiting still 
For this nice young girl from Harlem.

THE MARBLE ARCH. 
THE MILL'S SHUT DOWN. 
Sang with great success 
by BomE NoRWOOD. 
AS I 
strayed beneath a 
marble arch, one evening in July, 
A maiden fair, with golden hair, came geLthy tripping by; 
The lustre of her dirmiond eyes, shone on me like a 
torch, 
And in a 
whisper soft she said, is this the marble arch? 
CHORL's. 
Then round her lovely form I 
drew my magic, circle, 
I 
pressed her, I 
caressed her, my brain was in a 
whirl, 
Around her lovely form I 
drew my magic circle, 
I 
hissed her and I 
called her a 
very pivtty 
I 
took her to e 
shady spot twneath the spreading trees, 
I 
took Ino 
oilier nly-white hand, and fell down on my knees; 
Beloved, cried I, arise, said she, and before I 
had 
to speak 
nme imprinted a 
one burning 
upon in 
blooming cheek. 
Then round her lovely form, k,c. 
Good-night, says she, in a 
voice so sweet, and gentiy squeezed 
my hand, 
My knees began to Vock and shake, for I 
could scarcely stand; 
We'll meet again sonic other night, and Han' prepare to march, 
But where, cried I, she then replied, beneath that marble arch, 
Then round her lovely ! Orin, & c. 
However, since that fatal night, I 
have not seen my queen, 
But I've heard them say she's run away with a big fat horse 
marine; 
A 
ring I 
give her.

I'll never put it on her hand, 
stick it through her nom

The Man in the Moon is Looking, Love. 
As sung by LULA .MORTIMOR. 
Published by E. El. HARDING, 229 Bowery, New York. 
You all know what this feeling is, 
When at some quiet spot, 
All around you may be ice. 
But the love's burning hot. 
Of course her hand so tight you squeeze, 
As you both gaze afar; 
Yes, while the moon is laughing at you, 
Knowing what fools you are. 
,:iPOKEN.—When you are in love, and sitting on some ro-
Viantic cliff, by the light of the moon you gaze in the girl's 
face, and imagine how much powder and rouge she has been 
putting on; and she's thinking at the same time what express-
ive eyes, how his nose turns up, and I 
think I 
should love him 
a 
little more if it was a Roman, and the moon is winking at 
you and seems to say— 
Cull—The man in the moon is looking, love, 
He's winking, love, he's blinking, love ; 
And each little star can tell where you are, 
The man in the moon is looking. 
The other night, on Dover cliffs, 
A 
girl sat there with me ; 
The moon above kept peeping 011 4-
With look of naughty glee. 
I 
whispered tales of love, and said, 
Don't be a 
timid miss, 
But while the moon's behind a 
cloud 
Just one sweet little kiss. 
SPOKEN — Not now. 
Don't you see the man ? 
What man ? 
Why, the man in the moon! 
He's laughing at us. 
But just 
one, dear! 
No, no! —((
noitus.) 
As we sat gazing at the moon, 
Like spooney lovers do, 
My arm of course was round her waist, 
Nigh squeezing her in two. 
I 
heard the moon say to the stars, 
That pair I'll go and wed, 
And as the moon came from above, 
I 
rolled clean out of bed. 
SPOKEN.—It was a 
dream. 
I 
was not on Dover cliff Bitting 
with a 
girl by moonlight. 
I was in bed at Brixton with a 
rushlight shining upon me, and dreaming it was the moon, and

Her face beamed like the skies ! 
And my heart it is completely won, 
By the girl with the roguish eyes! 
CHORcrs. 
So I 
hastened to her side, 
And as the time so quickly flies, 
I 
told her I 
was deep in love 
With her lovely roguish eyes 
Now, slowly we walked on, 
Until she reached the gate ; 
She said that she must go, 
As the hour was growing late ; 
I 
asked her if she would meet me, 
When the Moon sank in the skies ? 
She answered Yes ! and by the old oak tree 
I 
watch for those roguish eyes ! 
So I 
hastened, Sco.

What ? no ! it cannot be that they've driven 
Their father, so helpless and old, 
(Oh, God, may their crime be forgiven, ) 
To perish out here in the cold. 
Oh Heavens, he is sadden'd and weary, 
See the tears how they course down his ,
-,biusl-s I 
Oh, this world it is lonely and dreary, 
And his heart for relief vainly seeks. 
CHORUS. 
For he's old and helpless, and feeble, 
The days of his youth have gone by; 
Then over the hill to the poor house, 
He wanders alone there to die. 
Ah me! on that old doorstep yonder. 
I've sat with ray babes on my knee, 
No father was happier or fonder 
Than I 
of my little ones three. 
The boys both so rosy and chubby, 
And Lily with prattle so sweet 
God knows how their father has loved the= 
But theyy've driven him out in the street. 
For he's old, kw 
It's long years since my Mary was taken, 
My faithful, affectionate wife ; 
*nce then I'm forlorn and forsaken, 
And the light has died out of my life. 
The. toys grew to manhood; he gave them 
A 
need for the farm! aye, and more, 
He ga-
..e them this house they were born in! 
And r.Lw he's turn'd out from its door. 
For he's old, &c. 
Oh, children! loved children! yet hear me, 
I 
have j,urneyed along on life's stage; 
With the ifope that you all would be near me, 
To comfort and cheer my old age: 
1Sly life-bloa I'd gladly have given, 
To shield And protect you! but hark! 
Though m3 heart breaks, I'll say it's you've driven 
Me out hfie to die in the dark. 
For he's old, Ix. 
rut, perhaps, they'll live happier without me; 
Farewell, d,rar old home, ah! farewell ! 
each pathway add tree here about me, 
Some memory precious can tell: 
Well! the flowers will bloom bright as ever, 
And the birds sing as sweet to the morn; 
Then over the hill from the poor house, 
Next Spring the old man shall be borne. 
For he's old, & 
lung with the greatest success by JENNIE ENGEL. 
THOUGH: you gentlemen are smiling, 
It's very plain to me, 
But most of you are single, 
Which of course ought not to be, 
There's girls I'm sure in plenty, 
Who would your happiness advance, 
By wedding you to morrow 
If they only had a 
chance. 
CHORUS. 
Then don't be shy, for single life's a 
sin 
Fair lady as the proverb says, 
Faint heart did never win. 
Then don't be shy, but do the best you cal, 
And when you go a 
courting 
Why, speak out like a 
man. 
When at your kind attentions, 
We appear to take offense, 
Pray don't be disconcerted 
That's merely a 
pretence. 
If to wring your ears we threaten, 
We of course mean no such thing, 
It's merely a 
suggestion, 
We ourselves should like a 
ring. 
Then don't be shy, kr.. 
Though we ladies are as sisters 
To the angels up above, 
Yet only whisper marriage, 
And were gentle as a 
dove. 
To say "Fes - 
is very foolish, 
When the question popp'd may be, 
But " Xo " would be an answer. 
Much more sifly you'll agree. 
Then don't be shy, ate. 
SONG AND DANCE. 
'Twas going to the Central Park, 
To take the country air, 
And see the fishes and the swans, 
And other sights so rare, 
I 
met a 
pair of roguish eyes, 
That pierced me through and through, 
And made me feel so very queer, 
I 
scarce knew what to do. 
CHORUS. 
She was all the heart could fancy, 
And lovely as a 
queen, 
And just about the gayest of the gay ; 
And it was her pair of roguish eyes, 
That pierced me thro' and thro' and thro' 
And charmed my heart and tens ,-s 
all away. 
(Dance.) 
Her dress was made in the latest style, 
And trimmed 
charming taste, 
She wore a 
brilliant necklace, too, 
Of diamonds—made of paste; 
Her golden hair in ringlets fell, 
Around her lovely neck, 
And since her charming face I've seen, 
My heart's a 
perfect wreck. 
She was all, etc.

My love L 
the belle of the Avenue, 
S!ie walks up and down ev'ry day ; 
And charms ev'ry one as she passes by, 
So beautiful, „ ro,eeful and gay ; 
The swells when they see her, go crazy ; 
And silently wish they were free 
To walk by her side, but they are denied, 
For she will have no one but me. (Oh!) 
Cnceaus. 
She is the belle of the Avenue, 
Graceful and bright, full of fairy light, 
Sweet and enchanting with eyes of blue, 
13,iani'ng with love and glee ; 
She is the star of society. 
Pride of the ball with her fairy form. 
Joy and delight of her home so bright, 
And dearer than life to me. 
Sometimes, when it's fine in the afternoon, 
Her ma sends her out for a 
walk ; 
"Now, darling." she'll say, " don't be long away, 
Don't stand with the young men to talk ;" 
0, ma I" she replies, • do not fear me— 
You know such a 
thin; cannot be ;" 
Then smiling she goes in all her nice clothes, 
And waits on the corner for me. ( Ha ! ha !) 
She is the belle, etc. 
We walk and we talk of the latest halls, 
And view all the styles of the day ; 
And when she must leave, oh! you can't conceive 
How much I 
would wish her to stay; 
But she will return on the morrow, 
That is, if mamma will agree ; 
And while we're apart. I 
know in my heart, 
She 
all the time wishing for me. (Ah!) 
She is the belle, etc.

Method of playing is somewhat complicated, but the directions have 
been made so that very little study will suffice to an ordinary under-

Courting Cards.—This Series of Cards has been arranged. 
to meet a 
want frequently felt by young people—a want of means of 
expressing one's sentiments in such a way as to be non-committal. 
many young ladies are visited by gentlemen who are either too 
dent or too fearful of a 
repulse, to venture upon asking the momentous 
question. The lady is restrained, by custom and a 
sense of propriety, 
from doing anything that would seem to be an unlady-like encourage-
ment. As a 
result of this dilemma, many 
lives are spent as an unloved 
tedious existence, which might have been prolonged and enjoyed in the 
happiness of matrimony. This pack of Cards will overcome the diffi-
culty, and being in the shape of quostions and answers, will cover every 
phase of courtship. 
The sentiments conveyed therein need not be 
adopted by the parties to the game as their own, unless it accords with 
the state of their affections, which fact makes further explanation un-
necessary. The playing of these Cards is not restricted to two players. 
but may be enjoyed by evening parties
