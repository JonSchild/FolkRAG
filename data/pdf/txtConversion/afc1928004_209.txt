BOLD JACK DONOHOE. 
Come all you true bred Irishmen, wherever you may be, 
Who'd scorn to wear a 
convict's chain, or live in slavery, 
Attention pay to what I 
say, and value it if you do 
While I 
relate the matchless fate of bold Jack Donohoe. 
CHORUS. 
With me hele kom hale come lay me down lay, 
Lay me down linsey bac, mash a 
mul gay; 
Lay me down linsey bac, mash a 
mag hooligen, 
ker boo, fly away leatherhead, bull bac a

rbi3 held undaunted Irishman, as you may plainly see, 
From Ireland was transported, and deprived of his liberty. 
there was McNamara, and Underwood, Bill Colbe and Wins-
Thloey

With rile hole horn hale, dze. 
The likes of Bold Jdck Donohoe was riot in this country, 
From maintaining of the people's laws, he fought so man-
fully, 
Sure he had rather roam the wide world through like a 
wolf 
or a 
kangaroo, 
Than to live in British slavery, gays Bold Jack Donohoe 
With me bele horn bale, Sze. 
Then never shall it yct he said, that O'Donohoe the brave, 
Shall submit to British slavery, or ever be a 
slave ! 
And then he closei his aching oyes, to bid this world adieu 
Crying: all good people, pray for the s ,u1 of Bold Jack 
Dconoboe.

THE OLD HAT. 
Written and Composed by .
NED HARRIGAN. 
Sung by HUGH MAGUIRE. 
Ant..—" Going to the Mass last Sunday." 
Mv name is McNamarra. 
I'm an American cit-i-zan; 
I'm proud you know, 
Wherever I 
go, 
I'm a 
true born Irishman: 
There's one thing, me boys, I'd have you know, 
And I've come to tell ye that, 
It's the seventeenth of March, 
Whin, as stiff as starch, 
I 
parade with my old hat. 
CHORUS. 
For it's down Broadway I 
march so gay, 
Wid Cornelius, Barney and Pat,— 
The people shout whin I 
turn out, 
And parade with my old hat. 
That hat was made in Dublin, 
in the year of ninety-eight; 
'Twas never called in and ye can't begin 
To say it's out of date. 
It's travelled the wide world over, 
From Ireland to Bombay, 
And the only time it can be seen 
Is on St. Patrick's day. 
For it's down, etc: 
Thin give three cheers for the hat I 
wear, 
Before it is too late, 
And nine more cheers for Patrick's day, 
The day we celebrate. 
And when you see me on parade, 
I'll raise me hat to ye, 
I'll invite ye all to come and call, 
And join my company. 
For it's down, ete. 
MULDOON, 
THE SOLID MAN. 
Entered according to Act of Congress, in the year 1874, by E. H. HARDING, 
in the Office of the Librarian of Congress, at Washington, D. C. 
The Music of this song is published by E. H. HARDING, 288 Bowery, New 
York. 
Price 10 cents. 
Written and sung by ED. HARRIGAN in his popular sketch of" Who owns 
the Clothes Line I " 
I 
AM a 
man of great influence, 
And educated to a 
high degree, 
I 
came here when small from Donegal, 
In the Daniel Webster, across the sea; 
In the Fourteenth Ward I 
situated, 
In a 
tenement house with my brother Dan -, 
By perseverance I 
elevated, 
And went to the front like a 
solid matt. 
CHORUS. 
Go with me and I'll treat you decent; 
I'll set you down, and I'll fill the can; 
As I 
walk the street each friend I 
meet 
Says, " There goes Muldoon—he's a 
solid man." 
At any party or any raffle 
I 
always go as an invited guest; 
As conspicuous as General Granite, boys, 
I 
wear a 
rosebud upon my breast; 
call'd upon to address the meeting, 
Without regard to clique or clan ; 
I 
show the constitution with elocution, 
Bekase you know I'm a 
solid man. 
CHORUS. 
For oppositions or politicians, 
Take my word I 
don't give a 
damn; 
As I 
walk the street each friend I 
meet 
Says, " There goes Muldoon—he's a 
solid man." 
I 
control the Tombs, I 
control the Island, 
My constituents they all go there, 
To enjoy the summer's recreation, 
And the refreshing East river air; 
I'm known in Harlem, I'm known in Jarsey, 
I'm welcomed hearty on every land; 
Wid my regalia on Patrick's day, 
I 
march away like a 
solid man. 
For oppositions, etc. 
A MAN AIN'T A HORSE IF HE'& BORN IN A 
STABLE. 
Sung by BILLY Asncnorr. 
Am.—" Our Grandfathers' Days." 
OF 
an illigant family, near Tipperary, 
As dacent a 
lot as e'er shouldered a 
hod, 
I 
was sprung, and so thinking the prospect to vary, 
Left my old ancient ancestors' home, and the sod; 
I'd a 
twist of the brogue I 
determined to alter, 
And speak native English—jinteel of course; 
If bred up a 
foreigner, why should I 
falter'? 
Though born in a 
stable a 
man ain't a 
horse. 
Tol de rol, etc. 
To be hired for a 
footman, I'd fixed it complately, 
To a 
great man who hated a 
tight Irish lad, 
And would not keep a 
servant but talked English nately, 
If a 
divil a 
one on the earth could be had; 
" 
What are you," says he.—" Why an Englishman, honey." 
" 
Where born 7"—Why, in Ireland, my jewel of course," 
" 
That can't be."—" It can, sir; 
I'll bet any money. 
Though born in a 
stable a 
man ain't a 
horse." 
Tel de rol, etc. 
He gabb'd and he chattered his coekneyilfire blarney— 
Bade me and try brogue to the divil go roam; 
Says I, " If Bow- bells was the lakes of Killarney, 
The divil a 
cockney would be born at home !" 
Cries he, " You pronounce neither one thing nor t'other.' 
Says I, " I've a 
tongue sure, for better for worse ; 
'Bout pronouncification, then, why make a 
bother ? 
Though born in a 
stable a 
man ain't a 
horse." 
Tel de rol, etc. 
At last all the innkeepers, where'er I 
enter'd, 
Bawl'd, " Put down the potatoes !" by way of disgrace. 
" 
Where the divil," thinks I, " can their knowledge be centred, 
Be my soul they must see I've the brogue in my face !" 
So though I 
talk English so native and aisy, 
My plump Irish features betray me of course! 
Yet I 
proved to your faces as nate as a 
daisy 
Though born in a 
stable a 
man ain't a 
horse. 
Tol de rol, etc. 
MOLLIE McGORMLY. 
An Irish Song and Dance by JOHN TrromPsoN. 
I 
WAS born long ago in the sweet county Monaghan, 
In the middle of a 
bog, I 
never will get on again, 
The Shamrock, the ship that I 
over here came sailing in, 
With those big blackguards of sailors all a 
pumpin' and a 
bailin' in ; 
Across the seas for ninety days, 
With yellow meal and butter milk, 
Musha bathershin-na-boeklish 
I'm sportin' Mollie, 0 ! (
Dance.) 
It's when I 
left old Ireland my patience it was taxin' 0! 
A 
nate lock of my bright red hair sure every one was axin' 0! 
They all set up a 
hullabaloo, the gossoons and the colleen 
bawns, 
To leave the pigs and praties with the fairies and the leper-
acauns; 
To cross the seas for ninety days, 
With yellow meal and buttermilk, 
Mush, bather-shin-tia-bocklish, 
l'm sportin' Mollie, 0 ! (
Dance.) 
I'm goin' to settle down when I 
get a 
bit of property, 
As large as any bog in shweet Shlather-Mac-OlDougherty, 
I'll go in for women's rights when here I 
am a 
resident, 
I'll be an alderwoman then or else a 
faymale president. 
SPOKEN.—Then bad luck to me if ever I— 
Cross the seas for ninety days. 
With yellow meal and buttermilk, 
Musha bather-shin-na-bocklish, 
I'm sportin' Mollie 0 ! (Diinee.)

NY FATHER SOULD CHARCOAL. 
A DOLLAR A DOZEN FOR SHIRTS. 
As sung by W ILLIAM ASHCROFT. 
IF 
ye's please, sirs, I'm a 
young widdy, 
A 
large family I 
have to maintain; 
For meself, sure I 
don't care a 
penny, 
For my children their bread I 
must gain. 
I'm looking around for such labor 
As a 
strong, hearty woman can do; 
For reference—ax all me neighbors, 
Your patronage I 
as of you. 
CHORUS. 
Collars, dresses, undershirt; 
Frocks, frills and underskirt; 
Gowns, cuffs and handkerchiefs, 
Arrah, a 
dollar a 
dozen for shirts. 
Last Monday, by way of no harm, 
Sure I 
met a 
handsome young man, 
I'd a 
washboard stuck under me arm, 
And a 
basket of clothes in me hand; 
Says he to me, Miss, I 
beg your pardon, 
Your mother does washing, I 
see; 
Says I, I'm meself, not me daughter, 
'Tis I 
does the wasbing, not she. 
Collars, dresses, etc. 
, 
When I 
was a 
servant in sweet Tipperary, oh 
I 
was as smart as the Divil, — 
And just as contrairy, oh 
An Irish Gossoon, 
And great was th' applause of it: 
My father sould charcoal. 
And that was the cause of it. 
CHORUS_ 
An Irish Gossoon, 
And great was th' applause of it, 
My father sould charcoal. 
And that was the cause of it. 
Arrab, my mother poor soul, had a 
habit of drinl' 
She fell in a 
ditch, 
Which set her to thinking oh I 
A mammoth Phratee, 
And great was the size of it, 
Me mouth held a 
dozen, 
Which widened the breadth of it 
An Irish Gossoon 
At a 
break-down or reel, It's highly and dutiful, 
And if to remember 
You need not stare at me, 
Sure I 
can wear my brogans, 
Both behind and in front of me. 
My father sould charcoal, 
And that was the cause of it 
An Irish Gossoon 
And how does yeas do, I 
see yeas all laugh at 
And what would yeas give, 
For a 
nice Photog-ragh of me, 
And if to remember 
You need not so stare at me, 
Sure I'll give every mother's son of yen'. 
A 
lock of the hair of me. 
An Irish Cossoon.

her 
tune during the wars in Ireland of 1688-90; the " black-backed 
Cow" representing, by a 
very whimsical metaphor, the cause of 
the exiled monarch. 
The following stanzas give a 
good idea of 
the rude original. 
THE DEAR BLACK COW.—[CoNasupEn.] 
Returning from mass, 
On a 
morning in May,

This melody is of high antiquity; it was adopted as a

Ah, drimindhu' deelish, my darling black cow, 
Say where are your folk, be they living or no? 
They are down in the ground 'neath the sod, lying low, 
Expecting King James, with the crown on his brow. 
But if I 
could get sight of the crown on his brow, 
By night and day travelling to London I'd go, 
Over mountains of mist and black mosses below, 
Till I'd beat on the kettle-drum Drimindhubh 0

Welcome home, welcome home, Drimindhubh 01

THE STAGE STRUCK IRISHMAN. 
AIR.—" What Can the Matter Be." 
Stage struck whin a 
boy, I 
wint to school gaily, 
Didn't care for the birch, tho' I 
tasted it daily, 
At school-time I 
ranted and whirled my shillelah, 
And I 
always was playing the fool. 
SroKEN—Says my master: 
Oh dear, what will become of him, 
Dear, dear, wlaat will become of him, 
Oh, dear, what will become of him, 
He's quite a 
disgrace to my school. 
Srottrm.—One day my master called my name out, " Dicky. 
my boy," said he, " howld up your head, and let me hear you re-
pate that piece I 
towled you to learn." " Yis, yis," said I, but 
the fact was I 
seldom paid any attention to what he said, so I 
just gave him what came first, and I 
bawled out lustily. " My 
name is Norval, on the Gramphian Hills, my father feeds his 
flock, he was a 
man, take him for all in all, what said the fool of 
Ilaggar's offspring is this a 
dagger I 
see before me. 
Give me 
another horse, bind up my wounds, I 
do remember an apothecary, 
but no more lek my father, than I 
to Hercules. 
Oh, my pro. 
phetic soul, my uncle, of all men else have I 
avoided thee, to be, 
or not to be, that is the question. 
I'm weary of conjectures, this 
Nnust end. 
SLNG—I 
shall, 
quoth my master, with rage his hea4 tossing, 
This is no place to give me sauce in 
Instead of a 
horse, I'll give you a 
horsing, 
So he bound me quite fast to a 
stool.

THE STAGE-STRUCK IRISHMAN.—(CoxcLumr.n.) 
SPOKEN—Says no at every stroke— 
Oh, dear, what will become of him, 
Dear, dear, what will become of him, 
Oh, dear, what will become of him, 
He's quite a 
disgrace to my school. 
SPGREN.—After he had flogged me until he was tired. "Young 
man," says he, " as there is not a 
bit more of the birch left, I 
shall tot flog you any more at present." " Thank ye, sir," sez I, 
" 
then as I 
may not have another chance again, I'll just take the 
liberty of telling you a 
bit of my mind," so I 
seized my shillelah, 
mounted a 
form, and held forth thus: " Most potent, grave and 
reverend seignior, my very noble and approved good master, that 
you have wronged me, cloth appear in this, you have disgraced 
me by a 
vile blow, had not a 
dagger done a 
nobl<u- service. 
I've 
been your faithful slave too long. I 
have set my life upon a 
cast, 
and I 
will stand the chazard of the die. Richard's himself again. 
I 
go 
He who moves one step to follow me dies upon the spot." 
Sumo—This said, I 
marched out with the air of a 
Rolla, 
The master jumped up and determined to follow, 
But I 
got the start, and I 
beat him quite hollow ; 
And I 
left the old fellow to cool. 
SPOKEN—And as I 
marched off I 
heard him saying: 
Oh, dear, what will become o; him, 
Dear, dear, what will become of him, 
Oh, dear, what will become of him, 
He's quite a 
disgrace to my school.

NOR 
AH MALOY. 
Wishing Gate." 
One fine summer's day, in the night rather late, 
Paddy Flinn had sneaked off to the old wishing gate. 
To just try his hand at a 
sort of a 
spell, 
About things that his auld mother used for to tell; 
That fairies and conjurers squatted down there, 
To give phat folks ax'd at that time of the year. 
So Paddy went there just his luck for to try, 
And he wished for a 
pig to put into his sty; 
But wait awhile yet as the truth I 
relate, 
Phat happened to Pat at the wishing gate. 
(Spoken)—Ocli! sure, Paddy was a 
good boy enough, if he 
had not been such a 
bad one ; and, sure, mighty fond G f 
me he was. 
Och! sure he fell in love WI(' Inc before he 
saw me. 
Och! faith, that's true for me, so it is; for ho 
was after telling me widout speaking a 
word of mouth— 
but, och! faith it was by word of eye he was after telling 
me. He was born at Kilkenny ; but sure he was such a 
roving blade, that he run away from home before he could 
walk. 
But wait awhile ago till Pse tell yez how the wis:1-
ing gate was after sarving, him. 
" 
I 
wish for," says Pat, as the gate he did stride, 
"As I've got but one pig, just another beside ; 
And I 
wish for some praities, the pigs for to fade; 
And I 
wish they might brade, and knock up a 
good trade, 
I'd then buy some poultry, ducks and a 
cow, 
El] 
19 
NORAH NALOY—[CoNCLUDED. 
Arid a 
thumping shillelah,to kick up a 
row; 
And then I 
cud get me a 
handsome young bride, 
And bogtrotting Katty (Spokot—That's me) I'd then push 
aside." 
But little did Pat know he was overheard, 
But, faith, I 
was there, and sucked in every word. 
(Spoken)—Och! bad luck to yez, Paddy, says I, you 
desaver ; but not a 
word did I 
spake. 
Sure is this the way 
you are true-hearted by your falsehood ? 
And every word 
of truth you told me was a 
lie. 
Well, I 
kept on talking 
widout saying a 
word. 
So away went Paddy on first and 
I 
before him, crying fit to break tile heart of me widout 
shedding a 
tear. 
So up he goes to the pig-sty to see had 
he got the other pig. ° eh ! by the faith of me, the only 
1 
pig he had left was gone, and had run away wid the pratie 
garden in his pocket. 
Arrah, Paddy, says l, phat's this you 
have been after wishing? 
Where are the pigs you ain't 
got? 
Where's the policy iii it's not born too? 
Where's 
your poultry and ducks ? 
Faith you are after looking like 
a 
goose! 
Where's the cow you was after axing the wish-
ing gate for? 
Sure and that cow's a 
bull ! 
And faith and 
troth, where is myself, the bogtrottcr, that you will dis-
charge before you have me ; and where's the shillelah, the 
shillelah that you are going to kick up a 
row wid? 
faith and sure, here's that same un, cried Jerry Donovan ; 
and faith, Paddy, I'll be after giving you phat you have 
been axing for—so I 
will. 
So Jerry hit on to Pat, and Pat 
fell to tearing all the bald hair off his head—for the fairy 
had made an old man of him, though he was only twenty. 
He got blind of both legs, lame of both eyes, his elbows 
down at heels, and his heels out at elbows; so I 
hope 
it will be a 
warning to all greedy folks, and teach us to be 
contented wid what we have, whether we have got it or 
not.

THE CAT IN THE CORNER. 
As Sung by Bryant's Minstrels. 
Och, I 
weep for the day when we were torn from tun ea, 
Our praties ana meal and our stirabout pot, 
When 3',Idy kept everything piping and hot, 
So snug with the cat in the corner. 
The pigs and the dogs with the children agree, 
Lay down on the floor so dacent with straw, 
While the rooster and hen sat perched up avak, 
Right over the oat in the corner. 
Our cabin was tidily covered with thatch, 
It looked like a 
harlequin's coat patch for patch, 
And the door opened !lately by rising the latch, 
Wid a 
thong that hung down in the corner. 
With scythe stuck up here and a 
reaping hook there, 
And Paddy's shelalah, the pride of the fair, 
Was stuck in the chimney to season with care, 
Right over the cat in the corner. 
Our windows so clean by an unlucky stroke, 
nad three of the prettiest panes in it broke, 
And we fastened up two with a 
tail of a 
coat, 
And the smoke went through one in the corner. 
Our dresser was dressea in illigant style, 
The trenchers and noggins, your heart 'twould beguile, 
While the goose she sat hatching her eggs all the while 
Along with the ea' i 
corner 
THE BARD OF ARMAGH. 
As sung by NED ilsrouokli. 
0 list to the lay of a 
poor Irish harper, 
And scorn not the strains of his old withered hands, 
nut, remember those fingers, they once could move sharper, 
In raising the merry strains to his dear native land, 
It was long before the shamrock, dear isle, lovely emblem, 
Was crushed in its beauty, by the Saxon's lion paw, 
And all the pretty colleens around me would gather 
Call me their bold Phelim Brady, the Bard of Armagh. 
How I 
love to muse on the days of my boyhood, 
Though four score and three years have flew by them, 
It's king's sweet reflection that every young joy, 
For the merry-hearted boys make the best of old men. 
At a 
fair, or a 
wake I 
could twist my shillelah, 
And trip through a 
dance wid my brogues tied with straw, 
There all the pretty maidens around me would gather, 
Call me their bold Phelirn Brady, the Bard of Armagh. 
In truth I 
have wandered this wide world all over, 
Yet Ireland's my home and a 
dwaing for me, 
And oh, let the turf that my old bones shall cover, 
Be cut from the land that is trod by the free ; 
And when serjeant death in his cold arms cloth embrace. 
And lull me to sleep with old Erin-go-bragh, 
By the side of my Kathleen, my dear pride, oh place me, 
Then forget Plielim Bra 
the Bard of Armagh.

PAT'S TRIP TO AMERICA. 
Sung by TONY PASTOR. 
Ala.-7 " 
New Policeman." 
I 
LEFT my native shore in May, 
A 
steamship swept me through the ocean 
Of mighty thundering hills of say, 
Of which dear people you've no notion. 
The thunders howled, the billows rowled, 
The storm growled, and I 
yowled beside them 
The lightning flashed, the ingines smashed, 
And the captain swore that ill betide them. 
SPOKEN.—OW, murther ! murther! but that was the day of sor-
row intirely. 
I 
thought it was all up with me. 
We were out 
for ten weeks and fourteen days; and we were tossed about un-
til the divil a 
bit I 
eat for seven years before, that didn't come 
gallopping up as if a 
whole brigade of blue horse cavalry was 
after it. 
It shook me as if there was a 
faction fight going on in-
side of me! 
CHORUS. 
I 
roared and bawled, and screamed and squalled, 
And wished the ship to go no further; 
I 
cursed the day I 
sailed away, 
And hollered, " Holy millia murther." 
Up went the ship.—" Oh dear," says I, 
And up wint my accounts that minute; 
Then down to L. or very nigh, 
I 
thought bedad I 
was half- way in it; 
(1) 
't 
25 
PAT'S TRIP TO AMERICA.—Continued. 
The waves smashed down our mast of shmoke, 
It was no joke, at dead of night thin; 
For sails and rigging danced a 
jig in 
The gale beneath the moon's dim light thin. 
SPOKEN.-011! be the powers, it was the divil's own commo-
tam sure enough. One minute we were catching Mother Carey's 
chickens, among thunder and lightning, upstairs in the clouds; 
the next minute we were dancing upon the back of a 
whale a 
tailor's hornpipe, or one of them knotty call dances—whales as 
big as the plains of Connamara or the Wicklow mountains, every 
one of them! Begorra, ould Jonah would have had a 
mighty 
fine time swallowing one of them fellows. 
There's no use in 
talking—the waves bate the Bannahar and Bannahar bates the 
divil, but our unfortunate butter tub bate the pair of them. I 
began to keep on singing out— 
I 
roared and bawled, etc. 
The captain cried, " Mate," I 
shouted " drink," 
The ship has struck—she'll go asunder ! 
We reeled upon the grave's thin brink, 
That minute our cargo was bolts of thunder, 
The ingines melted—the hailstones pelted— 
And faith I 
felt it mighty quarely ; 
The vessel parted and so I 
started 
For shore on a 
stick, that morning airly. 
SPOKEN.—Ow 
WOW 
but it was terrible to hear the thunder 
and the lightning pelting away at each other as if they had both 
gone crazy; then they would fire away at us as if there wasn't 
a 
target in the whole world for them to shoot at but our poor 
ship. 
There was I 
tossing about on the wather, like a 
pickled 
herring, and the big fishes making every grab to get a 
hoult of 
we. But I 
got safe ashore at last as dead as a 
lobster, my mouth 
as full of mud and sand as ever it was full of praties and butter-
milk. 
Be me sowl, 
I 
roared and bawled, etc.

IRISH CASTLES IN THE AIR. 
.r 
Sung by BILLY ASHOICOFT. 
Tuts world is all a 
bubble, no matter where we go, 
There nothing here but trouble, hardships, toil, and woe; 
Go where we will, do what we may, we are never free from care, 
And at the best this world is but a 
castle in the air. 
And yet each being loves the land where he sported as a 
child, 
The savage loves his native plain, his woods and praries wild, 
And I 
with a 
true Irish heart still wish in Ireland there, 
To sit amongst her groves and build my castles in the air. 
Old Ireland had her poet, she loved him I 
am sure, 
lie was a 
true born Irishman, his name ' twas Torn Moore, 
But of this world's sorrows we know he had his share, 
For Moore was always building his castles in the air. 
He sang the rights of Ireland, he sang against her wrongs, 
And many loving Irish hearts, they cherish yet his songs. 
He made the Irish heart rejoice, he bade them ne'er despair, 
And for Ireland in the future he built castles in the air. 
We boast of Dan O'Connell too, who struggled hard and sure 
To bring both peace and happiness to dear old Erin's shore, 
And though his efforts were in vain, the spirit still was there; 
For Dan still struggled on, and built his castles in the air, 
And though he's dead and gone, we find both old and young 
Will often quote the wit that flowed from Dan O'Connell tongue. 
The widow and the fatherless their sorrows he would share, 
And build for them in days to come bright castles in the air. 
Ould Ireland had her statesmen, and artists many one, 
her sculptures and her generals who noble deeds have done; 
Besides she boasts of Goldsmith with talents rich and rare, 
Whose standard works make thousands build their castle in 
the air; 
Her mountain lakes and valleys are lovely to behold, 
Her daughters they are bright and fair, her sons are brave and 
bold; 
No other country where I've been to me seems half so fair, 
It's the land where I 
in childhood built my castles in the air.

ADIEU TO INNISFAIL. 
Words by R. D. WILLums. Aiu.—" Cruiskin Lawn." 
ADIEU! the snowy sail swells her bosom to the gale, 
And our bark from Innisfail bounds away, 
While we gaze upon thy shore, that we never shall see more, 
And the blinding tears flow o'er, we pray. 
Mavourneen, be thou long in peace the queen of song— 
In battle proud and strong as the sea! 
Be saints thine offspring still—true heroes guard each bill, 
The harps by ev'ry rill sounds free! 
Tho' round her Indian bowers, the hand of Nature showers 
The brightest blooming flowers of our sphere; 
Yet, not the richest rose in an alien clime that blows, 
Like the brier at home that grows, is dear. 
Though glowing breasts may be in soft vales beyond the sea, 
Yet ever, Gramachree, shall I 
wail 
For the heart of love I 
leave, in the dreary hours of eve, 
On thy stormy shore to grieve, Innisfail. 
But mem'ry o'er the deep on her dewy wing shall sweep, 
When in midnight hours I 
weep o'er thy wrongs; 
And bring me, steeped in tears, the dead flow'rs of other years, 
And waft into my ears home songs. 
When I 
slumber in the gloom of a 
nameless foreign tomb, 
By a 
distant ocean's boom, Innisfail ! 
Around thy emerald shore, may the clasping sea adore, 
And each wave in thunder roar, " All hail l" 
And when the final sigh shall bear my soul on high, 
And on chainless wing I 
fly through the blue, 
Earth's latest thought shall be, as I 
soar above the sea, 
" 
Green Erin, dear, to thee—Adieu V' 
TIPPERARY DAN . 
Written by BILLY A SHCROFT. AIR.—" Hop Light, Loo." 
AWAY down in Tipperary, 
Where I 
wiled my time away, 
A 
courting of the pretty girls, 
And making of the hay, 
'Twas there I 
met my Katy, 
The truth I'll tell to you, 
She's my darling little posy, 
And my purty little doe. 
CHORUS. 
Then dance like Katy, 
And show your pretty feet, 
You are the charming Irish girl 
I 
always like to meet; 
Then dance like Katy 
And do the best you can 
The boy to go the whole hog 
Is Tipperary Dan. 
Old Ireland is the place 
For frollic, fun and mirth, 
If you search the whale world over, 
Its equal's not on earth, 
There's Jerry Noon and Patsy Flynn, 
And likewise Judy Cann, 
They're all agoing the whole hog 
With Tipperary Dan. 
Then dance, etc. 
In darling Tip where I 
was born, 
The boy's they are so free, 
The girls they are so hearty, 
And don't they like a 
spree; 
When Donnybrook was all the rage, 
It's there you'd some the fun, 
With sticks and stones and marrow bones 
quickly make you run. 
Then dance, etc. 
It's now my song is ended, 
I 
hope you'll on me smile, 
And join and give a 
hearty cheer, 
For dear ould Erin's Isle; 
I've done me best to please you, 
And the best can do no more, 
Then grant your smiles and kind applause, 
And I'll ask for nothing more. 
Then dance, ete. 
PRINCE THADY CORNELIUS M 'MURROUGH 
O'TOOLE. 
Ant.—" Darling Ould Stick." 
'TWAS just at the moment I 
chanced to be born, 
Our (log lost his wits and our cow broke her horn, 
And ' mongst other omens the neighbors observed, 
Our cat was locked up in the cupboard and starved. 
My (Trandmother was a 
great lady, 
And she said to ould Father O'Brady, 
Pray christen the beauty Prince Thady 
Cornelius M'Murrough 0"Toole. 
From the kings of ould Ireland descended am I, 
Though low my employment, my lineage is high; 
My silks are all worsted, of frize is my robe, 
A spade is my sceptre, a 
foot ball my globe. 
My mother's a 
great M'Namara, 
My Cousin King David O'Hara. 
And my forefathers flourished in Tara 
In the days of King Turlough O'Toole. 
Dame Fortune looks black, and I 
bask in her frowns, 
The son of a 
king, I'm scarce worth half a 
crown; 
Our jewels of state are lost amid strife, 
But Judy's the jewel and crown of my life. 
Stern poverty's self 
nnot bate us, 
Though fortune continues to chate us, 
And make all our bread and potatoes 
Hard fare for the house of O'Toole. 
Of donkeys my dad kept an illigant stud, 
But I 
was the favorite prince of the blood; 
I 
don't mane myself with the donkeys to class, 
Who makes such a 
bull is himself but an ass. 
For the folks who are troubled with phthisic, 
The milk of the donkey's for physic, 
A 
mighty good thing when one is sick, 
Was sould by my daddy O'Toole. 
Great Shela Na Guira and ould Granerwaile, 
Though females, fought each in a 
strong coat of mail, 
And sonic say the breeches was tacked to the coat, 
While they made smithereens of the spalpeens they smote. 
My a 
randmother's great grand- aunt's sisters. 
They were as you read in the registhers, 
As swordsmen renowned and as fisthers, 
Unmatched but by King Turlough O'Toole.

AN ILIGANT WAK E. 
A IR.—" Darling Ould Stick." 
Sung by BILLY ASHCROFT. 
IN 
Dublin, that city of riches and fame, 
A shoemaker died, Jerry Flynn was his name, 
The neighbors all grieved, rich and poor, high and low, 
And to the wake of poor Jerry resolved for to go. 
SPOKEN.—Poor Jerry! Though he often half-soled shoes, he 
was a 
whote-souled man himself. and many's the job he done for 
nothing, 
He mended Tim Reilly's brogans, and pegged Mrs. 
M'Carthy, and gave her a 
new patch on her upper, an' all for 
sixpence ; so no wondher they all came to his wake. 
Tim 
Donohoe wint for a 
coach for the ladies; he stuffed the fine soft, 
straw feather bed in the bottom of Con Casey's \Nheelbarrow ; 
he smoothed down the long feathers for fear any of them might 
stick in the lathes, and hurt their—feelings, as he handed them 
in. 
cuoncs. 
Mrs. Casey and Mrs. O'Blaney, 
Kate Nolan and Widow Delaney, 
Au 1 
the iligant Judy M'Shaney, 
To go to the beautiful wake. 
All dressed out so neat in their best Sunday clothes, 
Wid Doherty showing his jolly red nose, 
And another big party about twenty score, 
All met them a 
knocking at Jerry Flynn's door. 
SPOKEN 
Mrs. Flynn ! Mrs. Flynn ! why the blazes don't 
you open the door 
Here's the quality coining to Jerry's wake. 
Stick him up slantindickler in the bed; clap a 
cane pipe in his 
mouth and put a 
nightcap on him, that he may look nate and 
dacint. 
Mistress Biddy, will you shake some cane straw in the 
corner for the company to sit down on 9 There yeeci are all now 
as snug as a 
buff in a 
rug. 
Come. now, Darby Reilly, while 
Nelly's mixing the punch, will you just tip us a 
bit of a 
song ?" 
" 
Faix I 
will, mam ; I'll give you a 
verse from the Opery of Go 
to the Divil and shake yourself." " Silence! Pat Doyle, I'll run 
a 
sod of turf in your gob if you don't hould your tongue. Darby 
Reilly is going to sing; silence." 
(Sings in a 
drawling tone.) 
Aut.—" RaOng Canawl." 
Oh, once I 
never thought I'd be 
In this dejected state, 
A 
poor, forlorn effigy 
Bound down by hardship's fate.

AN ILIGANT WAKE.—Continued. 
The birds that flutter on yon tree, 
With terror strike my heart; 
Aich star I 
see alarmns me— 
Oh, why did I 
des- art ? 
SPOKEN.— " Oh, wow, ow! I 
can't bear to sing any more, it's 
too distressing for my delicate nerves. 
Missus M'Nulty, will ye 
thry a 
song, rum?" " Thoth I 
will, Darby. Here goes." 
(Mrs. .211%Allty sings.) 
Och! one evening for dervarsion's sake 
As I 
walked out alone, 
I 
beard a 
faymale lady bright 
Making her piteous moan. 
She wrung her hands and tore her hair, 
And to herself did cry, 
Aarrah, Johnny dear, don't murther me, 
For if you do I'll die. 
SPOKEN.—Here's Nelly wid the punch, now hand it round to 
Mrs. 'Al'earthy and Mrs. 0 
Blaney, 
Kate Nolan and Widow Delaney, 
And the beautiful Judy M'Shaney, 
And all at the iligant wake. 
Now the whiskey went round till they couldn't agree, 
Who was of the best rank or the best family; 
They from words came to blows, and their fists didn't spare, 
And by handfuls they pulled out each other's hair. 
SPOKEN.—Oh, ladies! ladies! aren't you forshamed av your-
selves, to behave like a 
set of jackasses ! Oh Judy, Judy ! Judy! 
Divil roast me but they've got Jerry in amongst them; they'll 
bate the life out of the corpse. 
Here, catch hoult of his toe and 
pull him out of the scrimmage. 
Haul away, here. 
We've got 
him out. 
Oh, bad luck to me, but they've give him a 
black 
eye. 
The brutes! to murther a poor dead man that way! 
Oh, he'll never get over it ; give me the broomstick, till I 
bate 
them all out, every one of them not exceptimg 
Mrs. Casey and Mrs. O'Blaney, 
Kate Nolan and Widow Delaney, 
And the red-headed Judy M'Shaney, 
And all at the iligant wake.

St 
IF I WAS THE RULER OF THE NATION. 
Written by BILLY ASHCROFT. 
Now I'm meself, dye see, and not no other, 
I 
was dragged up in the town of Termoy, 
I 
was born without trouble or a 
bother, 
But instead of being a 
girl I 
was a 
boy; 
Oh I 
wish I 
was the ruler of the Nation, 
In Erin brighter prospects we should see, 
By me faith, such thundering alteration 
As fiver was they would get from me. 
CHORUS. 
That's so, (symph.) faith it is, (
symph.) 
I'm just the lad to do it, you can see; 
If I 
was only the ruler of the Nation, 
Oh! the divil's alteration there should be. 
There's me wife as my Queen I 
would be making, 
if enough of whiskey had she would do, 
For my sons the finest girls I 
would be taking 
And the girls the finest lads should marry too; 
All the rich to hard labor I'd be turning 
And faith it's nearly time they lent a 
hand, 
For of late the poor they have been spurning, 
And banished from our dear ould native land. 
That's so, etc. 
And the blessed truth it is sure I 
am speaking ; 
Give us but our little bit of land, 
Our poor hearts they would be merrymaking, 
But no one seems to lend poor Pat a 
hand; 
By me faith if ruler I 
should be now, 
Och! murther! then contentment, we should see, 
Smiling faces all around about you'd see now, 
If ruler of Europe I 
could be. 
That's so, etc. 
THE IRISH SPECULATOR. 
As Sung by BILLY ASHCROFT. 
SINCE you call for a 
song, why I'll sing you that same, 
And if I 
should fail, your indulgence I 
claim ; 
And that you may know me I'll tell you my name, 
I'm Phelim O'Patrick, an Irish boy. 
I 
once speculated the whole of my cash 
To rise in the world or tumble down smash ; 
I 
must have been cracked when my money I 
spent, 
For like a 
cracked thing all to pieces I 
went. 
35 
SPOKEN—Be aisy now, my darling, till I 
tell you all about it. 
When I 
lived in ould Ireland, that sweet place of joy, I 
had an 
estate; and by the powers, it was a purty spot, called the 
Mountain in the Mist, or a 
Diamond in the Bog, surrounded by 
wather as clear as mud and as strong as whiskey ; then to cross 
it a 
beautiful bridge, built of iron, with a 
stone bottom. 
But 
the castle I 
had, it was the purtiest place in the world, and con-
sidering it served to keep poultry and pigs, be jabers! it was 
always most illigant clean. 
But the farm I had for bulls, bul-
locks, pigs, jackasses and all such beautiful poultry as that ; and, 
bad luck to tae, if I 
was not cock of the whole walk myself, do 
you mind. 
But the praties I 
grew, they were the boys—they'd 
make you open your mouth like a 
three-bushel sack, and they'd 
run down your throat like a 
steam- coach down a 
coal pit, or a 
1 
posie of flies down a 
treacle keg. 
Och! bad luck to the steam-
coach, I 
wish it had run down my throat, before I 
thought of 
speculating; but it was all owing to my wife, and be hanged to 
her. " Phelim," says she. " What, darling ?" says I. " Why 
don't you speculate l" says she. " What in ?" say I. " In 
railways, to be sure," says she," and make your fortune by steam 
like Mr. Hudson, the great Railway King, who made £ 16.000 
all at a 
whip." " Och, sure bad luck to him," says I. 
So away 
I 
went, sold my grunters, burned my sticks and set off hi bright 
favor for speculation, which I 
find is nothing at all in this de-
ceitful world, but— 
(1)

THE IRISH SPECULATOR—Continued. 
CIIORUS . 
Hubbery, bubbery, bother and strife— 
I 
wish I 
were dead to get rid of my life, 
For in this world I 
find no joy, 
I'm Phenol OTatrick, an Irish boy. 
Five pounds worth I 
bought in the Greenock Railroad, 
And near to that spot I 
took up my abode, 
And there very soon my authority showed, 
I'm Phelirn O'Patriek, an Irish boy. 
One day I 
went with a 
stick in my hand, 
To see that they wrought, and at work didn't stand ; 
Says I, dig away and do your work right, 
Or I'll sack every divil on Saturday night. 
SPOKEN—" Who ate you 7" says an ugly animal, with a 
nose 
on his face like a 
jackass's grandfather, and an eye in his head 
like a 
hawk, and a 
mouth, och, blood an' ounds, boys, such a 
mouth ; was it a 
mouth or was it a 
railway tunnel 7 
See, boys, it 
was actually so big that he used to let it out for committee railway 
meetings, and I'm told he made a 
good a 
job of it, as there wasn't 
large halls in every town or country village. " Who are you 7" 
says he. " I'm not going to answer that question," says I. " I'm 
Phelim O'Pa trick, your master, so obey or you walk about your 
business. Leave oft digging there and come and dig here, but first 
build me a 
house four stories high, all alike at every corner and 
side, with a 
garret at the back of it, and a 
fish-pond on the top 
of the middle, and yourself the greatest trout that's dragged 
out of it; but first dig down here. 
Dig as hard as you can till 
you come to soft water." ° eh! I'd scarcely said the words, 
when down I 
went like a 
sky- rocket. " Knock him down," says 
they. " 
dam," says I; " can't you let a 
man up once be-
fore you knock him down twice ?" 
When up I 
got, and showed 
fight to a 
fellow who was dancing a 
war dance behind me, and 
whom I 
never saw before; but he gave me a 
tip over the right 
eye and on the left ear, and knocked me into an ould broken 
rail-wagon, full of mud, When I 
felt the dirty stuff running down

THE IRISH SPECULATOR.—Concluded. 
my throat I 
knew I 
was murdered, killed and speechless. I 
began 
to roar out like thunder an ' ounds— 
'Jobbery, bubbery, etc. 
I 
went the next day where my money I 
paid, 
Before the committee long speeches I 
made; 
Says I, before such packings myself I 
degrade, 
I'm Phelim O'Patrick, an Irish boy, 
Come give me my money, and that very quick, 
Before I 
make use of this illigant stick; 
You bog-trotting blackguards, don't think I'm a 
fool, 
For I 
whack every divil like brats at a 
school. 
SPOKEN.—Then again " who are you ?" says an ould frosty_ 
nosed, gray-headed sinner, with a 
pair of spectacles hung over 
his countenance, taking a 
perspective view of me like a 
barn-
door savage. " Take off your spectacles," says I, " and be after 
taking a 
telegraphic view of me, and you'll find out I'm a 
rail-
way speculator, and I 
have found out it's a 
bad spec altogether; 
and I 
want my money back. 
Are you going to give it to me 7" 
says I. " We are not," says they. " Are you not," says I. 
" 
We tell you we are not," says they. 
Tip went my shillaleh 
and down went the committee, all of a 
bunch together. " That 
man's mad," says the farthest off " Och, the same to you, sir," 
says I. " Walk off with him to the mad-house," says they; and 
by ray sowl, and so they did, as hard as they could run wid me, in 
a 
coach. " Oh, the doctor! the doctor! the doctor !" said they. 
" 
Oa, murder ! murder ! murder !" says I. " Bleed, shave, blis-
ter his head," says they ; and by my sowl, and so they did as 
bald as a 
bladder; and when I 
found the sweet-scented Windsor 
soap of the barber's along with the hair from the crown of my 
head, moving down my throat, for all the world, as if there were 
a 
pack of grey- hounds after them; and then when I 
knew I 
was 
murdered, killed and speechless, I 
began to roar out for the 
third and last time— 
r`r 
llubbery, bubbery, etc.

In his hat good Saint Patrick used always to wear 
The Shamrock whenever he went to the fair; 
And Nebuchadnezzar, no doubt, highly priz'd 
A 
bit of the blossom when he went disguis'd: 
For the bosom of beauty itself might expand, 
When bedeck'd by the Shamrock of Old Ireland; 
There's a 
charm that no Irishman's heart can withstand, 
In the beautiful Shamrock of Old Ireland. 
When far, far away, a 
sweet blossom I've seen, 
I've dreamt of shillelaghs and Shamrocks so green, 
That grow like two twins on the bogs and the hills, 
With a 
drop in my eye that with joy my heart fills.; 
And I've bless'd the dear sod from a 
far distant strand, 
And the beautiful Shamrock of Old Ireland ; 
There's a 
charm that no Irishman's he9rt can withstand, 
In the beautiful Shamrock of 01,1 n

THE IRISH ACTOR. 
As sung by the late Sam. COLLIN s, England's greatest Irish Comic. 
AIR.—" Pat's Curiosity Shop." 
BY 
way of an introduction, my name is Mr. Denis O'Shea, 
Long before I 
was born, so they tell me, I 
wrote a 
most illigant 
play; 
The poetry, plot, and conception, e'en the great Shakespeare 
couldn't surpass; 
'Twas pertaining to tragedy, comedy, opera, burlesque, and 
farce; 
It so puzzled the play-folks to act it that it was going to be put 
on the shelf, 
So I 
popped up behind the green curtain and acted the whole 
play myself. 
SPOKEN.— Sure and faith, precocious talent was the family 
badge of the O'Shea's. 
My father could say the alphabet before 
he could speak, and strutted and fretted his hours on the stage 
'fore he was short-coated ; but for the matter of that, he was al-
ways short-coated, for the only coat he had to his back was a 
pair of leather breeches, and were down at the heel; but as 
Shakespeare says in his play of Uniphry Clinker— 
" 
0 ! that estates and offices were given to the merit of the winner,. 
How many hungry mouths would be well fed, 
How many be well clad, whin they were naked, 
How many be employed whin out of work, 
How many have full pockets that are empty." 
Sure and faith, it was just so with father, for he always had the 
most labor to do when he was out of work; and he was a 
man of 
strict honor, that he always washel his hands of a 
dirty acticti be-

fore he did it, so that he even commanded respect from the great 
that were dead and buried; and he used to say as Shakespeare 
said in the words of Ben Johnson: 
Put honor in one eye and your fist in the other, 
And I'll see them both in blindness, 
As I 
love the name of honor more than I 
do the first. 
ClIORES. 
Am.—" St. Patrick was a 
Gentleman." 
That I'm an actor bred and born, sure there's no one can deny, 
sirs, 
At my tragedy they laugh, at my comedy they cry, sirs; 
My voice and action's just the style, in favor I'm advancing, 
And instead of singing of my songs, by the powers they're done 
by dancing. 
SeoKEN.—Arrah, sure I'm the broth of a 
boy for that same, as 
Shakespeare says in the words of Goldsmith— 
" 
Many a 
flower is born to blush unseen, 
Looked but coldly on sure everywhere." 
And wasn't Shakespeare a 
sample of that same. William Shake-
speare was born at Stratford in Bow in the county Cork, the north 
part of Ireland ; he showed marks of very early genius in his 
youth, and paid great attention to his learning by playing the 
truant every day he went to school. 
He passed his time in 
poaching and deer stealing, which so delighted the lord of the 
manner that he gave youn'T Shakespeare three months in New-
gate, only Billy aave them leg- bail, and escaped from prison be-
fore they got him in it; so he walked every step of the way to 
London by riding in a 
warron; but after all he couldn't dance a 
song like this—( Dances an Irish jig.)

THE OULD MAID. 
Written by N ED H ARRIGAN for BILLY A SHCROFT. 
I 
LEFT dear ould Ireland for the land of the free, 
I 
want to get married, Oh, who will have me 7 
You know this is leap year, and I'm going to try 
To get married just once before I 
may die. 
CHORUS. 
Oh! dear, I 
feel much afraid 
If I 
don't get married I'll die an ould maid. 
My relations they tould me that when I 
came out 
would sure get a 
husband because I 
was stout, 
A 
rich one av coorse, I'm intending to get, 
I've been here four years and I've not found one yet. 
Oh ! dear, etc. 
I'm purty good looking, this dress is bran new, 
And they call me the belle of Fifth Avenue, 
I'm bound to get married, and that without fail, 
I'll marry a 
Chinaman and cut off his tail. 
Oh! dear, etc. 
THE WHALE. 
Sung by BILLY ASHCROFT. 
'TWA :5 
eighteen hundred and forty-five, 
On the twenty-first day of July, 
When our ship set sail with a 
fine and pleasant gale, 
And for Greenland she bore away, brave boys. 
And for Greenland she bore away. 
Now it's when we got to that could country, 
Sure it grieved our hearts full sore 
For to leave our friends and relations 
All behind, and the purty girls on the shore, brave boys, 
And the purty girls on the shore. 
Up aloft, up aloft, the Captain cried out. 
Wid a 
spy glass in his hand, 
A 
whale! a 
whale! he cried out, 
And she squirted out at every span, brave boys 
And she squirted out at every span. 
Now the boats they were lowered, 
And the lines they were payed out, 
1Vhen she gave a 
mighty flourish Ivid her tail, 
And she upsot the boat and killed five men, 
But they niver eot a 
hould of that whale, brave boys, 
I3ut they niver got a 
hould of that whale.

NOTTINGHAM FAIR. 
As sung by BILLY ASHCROFT. 
As I 
was a- going to Nottingham fair, 
All riding on horseback upon a 
gray mare, 
Her color was red, but the divil a 
hair 
But what was all welter upon the gray mare. 
There were princes and dukes and a 
great many more, 
All riding on horseback and walking before, 
And the people did all wonder and stare 
To see a 
coach and six horses drawn by a 
gray mare. 
It rained and it hailed, and I 
stood in the storm, 
With my hat in me hand to keep my feet warm, 
Then I 
axed AViddy Casey could she fancy me now, 
As well as the day when I 
came from the plough. 
Oh, I 
looked all around, divil a 
one could I 
see, 
The streets were so crowded at staring at me, 
And there stood a 
drummer a 
beating his drum, 
Wid his hands in his pockets before a 
big drum. 
My beast got unruly, and pitched me in the ditch, 
Me clothes she did bruise and my skin she did tear, 
I 
shouldered my saddle and mounted again, 
And all on my tip toes I 
rode over the plain. 
Now I'll take my gray mare and a 
fishing I'll go, 
And a 
fishing I'll go whether or no; 
My fish she turned over, my wagon did spill, 
Ill sell my gray mare, No, I'll be hanged if I 
will. 
MARY OF TIPPERARY. 
Words and music by S. 
LOVER. 
Sung by Miss K ITTY BROOKE. 
FROM sweet Tipperary, see light-hearted Mary, 
Her step like a 
fairy, scarce ruffles the dew, 
As she joyously springs and as joyously sings, 
Disdaining such things as a 
stocking or shoe; 
For she goes bare-footed, like Venus or Cupid, 
And who'd be so stupid to put her in silk, 
When her sweet foot and ankle the dewdrops bespangle, 
As she trips o'er the lawn, at the blush of the dawn— 
It's she trips o'er the lawn with her pail full of milk. 
For the dance when arrayed, see this bright mountain maid,— 
If her hair she would braid with young beauty's fond lure, 
O'er some clear fountain stooping, her dark tresses looping,— 
Diana, herself, ne'er had mirror more pure ! 
How lovely that toilet—would Fashion dare soil it 
• 
With paint or with patches, when Nature bestows 
A 
beauty more simple, in mirth's artless dimple, 
Heaven's light in her eye ( the soft blue of the sky), 
Heaven's light in her eye, and a 
blush like the rose.

PADDY'S BALLOON ASCENSION. 
As sung by PADDY CAREY. 
Ant.—" Paddy's Curiosity shop." 
AanAu, boys, it's meself that will tell ye, 
And that 1 
can do pretty soon, 
Of the incidents strange that befell me, 
When I 
travelled up to the moon. 
I 
heard that, quare sowls did reside there, 
So I 
in a 
balloon wint one day, 
And as swift as a 
race horse did ride there, 
From earth disappearing away. 
ClIORUS. 
I 
tell you the truth, on my honor, 
How I 
travelled up in a 
balloon; 
For sure it's meself, Paddy Connor, 
That journeyed smack up to the moon. 
I 
took with me mate, bread, and murphies, 
Fearing hunger my stomach might goad, 
Intending to stop at O'Durphey's, 
Who a 
whiskey shop keeps on the road; 
But the first thing I 
met was misfortune, 
I 
ran against a 
cloud in my way, 
Who vexed at my sad lack of caution, 
Benighted meself in the day. 
I 
tell you the truth, etc. 
The comet much grieved at my trouble, 
Took pity upon my sad case, 
Delivered me out of my hobble, 
By lighting me out of the place; 
I 
thanked the man for his politeness, 
And tipped him a 
drop of " =teen"; 
I 
got drunk, and so did his brightness, 
And fell fast asleep on the green.

PADDY'S BALLOON ASCENSION.— Continued. 
Then I 
met some stars skipping and dancing, 
While Boreas chaunted a 
song, 
My balloon at the sound, began prancing, 
And swiftly fled with me along, 
I 
shook hands with the wind and the thunder, 
Lit my pipe with the forked lightning flash, 
Wint up a 
wrong street in a 
blunder, 
And a 
tundher cloud there I 
did smash. 
I 
tell you the truth. 
A 
whirlwind liked not my intrusion, 
Resolved to destroy me with woe, 
Sent me plump against the moon in confusion, 
And I 
knocked a 
piece out with a 
blow ; 
The man in the moon, with pain I 
know, 
Upset my vehicle and me; 
But I 
clung tight as wax to a 
iainbow, 
Like a 
monkey would cling to a 
tree. 
I 
tell you the truth, etc. 
I 
hung to it more than an hour, 
And saw my balloon quickly depait, 
The rain all the time it did shower, 
I 
thought it would have broken my heart; 
But determined to make no more speeches, 
And wishing to get back to town, 
I 
buttered my legs and my breeches, 
And on the rainbi w I 
quickly slipped down.

Oh, yes, it's a

Some look down on an Irishman, as if they thought that we

Could not but helpless dolts or fools e'er have a

What matters where a 
man is born-I 
see in Erin's Isle 
There's lots of native gentlemen to greet you with a 
smile ; 
For there's other kinds of gentlefolks, besides a 
dandy beau, 
Then, why can't Paddy be a 
gentleman, that's what I 
want to 
know ? 
Cho. 
You cannot give the reason why, I 
see it in each phiz, 
That Paddy's not a 
gentleman, because you know he is ; 
He's always good to help a 
friend, although his means are scant, 
And if he's fond of blarney-he hates deceit and cant ; 
His coat may be of common frieze, his heart won't freeze, oh 
DO ; 
Then why can't Paddy be a 
gentleman, that's what I 
want 
know ?-67to. 
If an Englishman's a 
gentleman, oh I 
woorrah I 
then it's true, 
As Pat is John Bull's brother, then he must be one too ; 
Just read the Irish history, and hi that same you'll find 
Great deeds of Irish gentlemen, St. Patrick's one, d'ye mind ;

THE BROTH OF A BOY IS PADDY. 
Written and arranged by BILLY ASHCROFT. 
A I 
R.—" The Boys of Kilkenny." 
On, there's not in ould Ireland a 
boy half so free 
As bould Paddy Flynn—be me sowl, and that's me ; 
At breaking the hearts of the girls I 
am A 
I, 
And at breaking the heads of the boys, beat by none-
At breaking the skulls of the boys, banged by none. 
At making love, sir, Pat's the boy ; 
The ladies' hearts can't I 
decoy I 
Sure don't they gambol, kiss, and toy, 
And galivant with Paddy; 
And then so shy I 
wink my eye, 
Awhile the darlint creatures, ay. 
Paddy can stuff the blarney down, 
Paddy can grief in whiskey drown, 
And crack a 
bottle, joke, or crown, 
Such a 
broth of a 
boy is Paddy. 
AIR.—" Lowbaek Car." 
Last night I 
went a 
courting, 
And met with a 
mishap; 
At Judy Riley's windy 
I 
went to give a 
rap : 
But bad luck to the cistern 
Poo: Riddy 
ooi npon, 
'Twas like the tricks of politics— 
Not to be depended on, 
For no sooner had I 
put 
The sowl of me iligant foot 
On the lid, than it slipped, 
And whish !—in I 
was dipped 
Souse bead over heels in the butt. 
AIR. -" St. Patrick's Day." 
Faith, so many I've admired, Pm getting tired 
Of courting the smart little lasses at all ; 
I've tipped ' em the blarney, but spite of me blarney 
They've bid Paddy (bad luck!) good morning! 
I've kilt all my rivals again and again, 
And nine times for love it's meself that's been slain l 
Wid grief I 
am laden, for fear an mild maiden 
I'll die without wedlock adorning. 
Ant.—" The Ould Bog Hole." 
So now, who'll marry a 
nate Irishman ? 
For a 
lady I'll do all iver I 
can; 
I'm not very rich, but I'm born to good luck, 
I've a 
cow just died and a 
dropsical duck; 
I'm expecting a 
fortune, and sure it won't fail 
To come— when the income tax they reptile. 
Shall I 
spale to the praist to make it all right, 
And order for music a 
plany fortnight ? 
Who'll wed a 
boy from the Emerald Isle ? 
Who'll on the suit of a 
bold Paddy stni!e 1 
Who'll send a 
letter me grief to benuile 1 
To Pat Number One-ty one Lower Turnstile 
Who'll wed a

MY COUNTRY. 
Words by Wm. .A.I'Comn, Belfast. 
OH, Erin, my country ! although thy harp slumbers, 
And lies in oblivion in Tara's old hall, 
With scarce one kind hand to awaken its numbers, 
Or sound a 
long dirge to the Son of Fingal; 
The trophies of warfare may hang there neglected, 
For dead are the warriors to whom they were known ; 
But the harp of old Erin will still be respected, 
While there lives but one bard to enliven its tone. 
Oh, Erin, my country ! I 
love thy green bowers, 
No music's to me like thy murmuring rills ; 
Thy shamrock to me is the fairest of flowers, 
And naught is more dear than thy daisy- clad hills ; 
Thy caves, whether used by thy warriors or sages, 
Are still sacred held in each Irishman's heart, 
And thy ivy- crowned turrets, the pride of past agos, 
Though mouldering in ruin, do grandeur impart! 
The breezes oft shake both the rose and the thistle, 
While Erin's green shamrock lies hushed in ti:e dale ; 
In safety it rests, while the stormy winds whistle. 
And grows undisturbed, ' midst the moss of the vale : 
Then, hail ! fairest island in Neptune's old ocean ! 
Thou land of Saint Patrick, my parent a 
gra ! 
Cold, cold must the heart be, and void of emotion. 
That loves not the music of ' vErin-go-Bra L: 11 !'' 
THE DANCING IRISH JOCK-MY 
Written by JERRY COHAN. 
Music by B ILLY A SHCROFT. 
I 
LIVE beside the race track, where fast men and horses goes, 
My father is a 
stable man, my mother washes clothes, 
I 
brush the jintlemen's coats and then I 
hold their horses, too, 
I 
like to sing and dance, and that is what I'm agoing to do. 
CHORUS. 
Come listen to me now, (dance) 
I'm agoing to show to you, 
That l'm the lad that's always glad, 
When I've dancing for to do. 
Before I 
walked I 
learnt to dance, ' fore I'd could talk I'd sing, 
My father used to stop me, but again I'd soon begin 
My mother said it was no use I 
never would keep still, 
sing and dance at every chance, I 
guess I 
always will. 
Come listen to me now, etc. (dance.) 
And now I'm going to try to stop, and rest a 
little while, 
I've done the best to please you, and I 
hope you like my style, 
I 
have come horses for to hold, and jintlemen's clothes to clean, 
So now I'll go because you know they'd wonder where I'd been. 
Come listen to me now, etc. 
THE IRISH SUTLER GIRL. 
AIR.— "Tramp, Tramp, the Boys are Marching." 
Sang by Miss KITTY BcooKE. 
Ax Irish sutler girl, I 
rouse my friends at dawn, 
With sound of fife and drum so loud and clear, 
The boys of our Brigade, they never were afraid 
To meet their foes, but charge them with a 
cheer. 
CHORUS. 
Tramp, tramp, tramp, the boys are marching, 
Forward! brighter days will come, 
When our native land shall be happy, prosperous, and free, 
Then merrily we'll sound the fife and drum. 
Too long has faction wild, our fondest hopes beguiled, 
And discord filled our Shamrock Isle with shame; 
But deadly feuds shall cea ,e, and all unite ill peace, 
To blazen to the world old Ireland's fame. 
Tramp, tramp, tramp, etc. 
So let us all engage, no longer war to wage 
With friends, but wait and keep our powder dry, 
Then should a 
forei,zn host e'er land upon our coast, 
We'll march along and quickly make them fly. 
Tram', I m, tramp, etc. 
As Sung by BILLY A SHCROFT. 
LISTEN awhile and I'll sing you a 
ditty 
About the grand wedding of Larry McGee, 
Who lived in a 
fashionable part of the city, 
In a 
snug little mansion in Avenue E; 
And of the grand times we had at the wedding, 
While whiskey and fun it went round so free, 
Dancing and singing we set the room ringing, 
At the grand wedding party of Larry McGee. 
Whack! fal lal fal lal fal lad dy- dee, 
Here's the boy that's fond of a 
spree; 
Whack! fal lal fal lal fal lad dy dee, 
Whack! Haroo! for Larry McGee. 
Sure there was Donohue with his ould fiddle, 
McGuinnis, the first man, and Darby McShane, 
O'Brien, McCarty and Timothy Widdle, 
That brought to the wedding their bran new corgane ; 
There was big Andy Fain the large whiskey drinker, 
Wid Barney Fitzgibbons and Dennis Farlee, 
McCorkey the butcher, and ould Doyle the tinker, 
Were all at the wedding of Larry McGee. 
Whack! fal lal, etc. 
While down at the supper they ate very hearty, 
And filled themselves up to the very wind pipe, 
When an accident happened to Biddy McCarty ; 
She half-choked herself with a 
large piece of tripe; 
You ought to see Riley sail into the mutton, 
While all of the ladies did titter with glee; 
Ile fasted three days, the hungry old glutton, 
To leave room for the supper of Larry McGee. 
Whack ! fal lid, etc.

STEWART, and Sung by BILLY Asncuorr. 
I 
Am an Irish boy, and my heart is full of joy ; 
I 
owe my breath to famous Limerick City, 
I 
can handle well the twig or flitter an Irish jig, 
Or give you a 
stave of a 
native ditty ; 
My heart is seldom sad, I 
like to make folks glad, 
And the girls' eyes a 
twinkling like a 
star, Oh ! 
I'm always at my ease, for my friends I 
love to tease— 
I'm the rattling, rowling, teasing Pat O'Hara. 
CHORUS . 
Hurrah ! my Irish boys, that's fond of fun and noise, 
There's not from Dublin down to Connermara, 
Or from Limerick to Kildare, a 
boy that can compare 
With rattling, rowling tearing Pat O'Hara. 
And on a 
pattern day my heart is light and gay, 
I 
frisk across the green sod light and gayly ; 
I 
am always up for fun but was never known to run, 
For that would be disgrace to my shillaleh ; 
If a 
colleen to 
you see that's looking after me, 
And faix her name is Kitty McNamara, 
With two eyes as black as a 
sloe's that wherever I 
may go 
They are always chasing after Pat O'Hara. 
Hurrah ! my Irish boys, etc. 
I 
love the Emerald sod where in childhood first I 
trod, 
With its hills and valleys clothed in shamrocks green, 
And its colleens sweet and fair, few with them can compare, 
For their equal's mighty seldom to be seen sure ; 
Though the times have changed this while in dear mill 
Erin's Isle, 
And many have bad to wauder near and far, 0! 
Arrah ! just keep up your heart, you'll find that the better 
part, 
Tis 1116' style that always pleas(-s 
Pat O'Hara. 
Hu r 
au ! my Irish boys:, etc.

Of grief though each man gets his share, 
Increasing it he's oft employed ; 
Many a 
trouble, and many a 
care, 
We make ourselves, we might avoid; 
But, oh! in doing all we can 
To spoil the memory of delight, 
The safest and the surest plan 
Is staying out too late at night. 
Youth, they say, will have its fling, 
But nature has this certain law, 
That age must pay the reckoning 
If the account we overdraw. 
But to be healthy, wealthy, and wise, 
The proverb, if translated aright, 
Is early to bed and early to rise, 
And don't stay out too late at night.

TARA'S HILL SO GREEN. 
Ara.—" The Wearing of the Green." 
DEAR native land, thy former might 
Has long since passed away ; 
Where Tara's stately palace stood 
There's but a 
mound of clay ; 
The Lia Faint of destiny 
On which the Kings were crowned, 
Now mark the spot where heroe3 sleep, 
Interred in sacred ground ; 
The minstrel's voice is hushed in death, 
His harp is heard no more 
Within that hall where gladness reigned, 
In happy days of yore ; 
But though no monument points out 
The glories that have been, 
We love the very grass that grows 
On Tara's hill so green. 
Dear Ireland, now fallen low, 
Thy sorrow we deplore, 
And mourn thy bravest sons, compelled 
To quit their native shore, 
And pray that in the western world, 
Though honored, loved and free, 
They'll ne'er forget the little isle 
That lies far, far o'er the sea, 
But join with us in earnest prayer, 
That brighter clays are near, 
When clouds that shroud our Fatherland 
Shall burst and disappear ; 
When former feuds shall be forgot, 
Nor strife again be seen, 
But songs of joy ascend once more 
From Tara's hill so green.

KICKED OUT FROM HOME. 
Written by BrtaAr ASHCROFT. Am," 
Driven trom florae." 
OUT of my dwelling, kicked out in the street, 
Pantaloons covered with mud from his feet, 
Mother-in-law's in her temper to- day, 
Wearing her old shoes with kicking away ; 
Not even the price of a 
pint I 
possess, 
No one will liquor me up to excess ; 
Beerless, tobaccoless, hatless I 
roam, 
All through a 
washing day, kicked out from borne. 
CHORUS 
No one to treat me, naught I 
possess, 
No one to liquor me up to excess ; 
Beerless, tobaccoless, moneyless I 
roam, 
Caused by my mother-in-law, kicked out of home. 
The peeler's approaching I 
care not to see, 
I 
know that he's keeping his eye upon me, 
It rain cats and dogs, I 
shall never get dry, 
ci 
And, oh, not the ghost of a 
gingham have I. 
Oh, think what it is to be friendless and poor, 
I 
feel that I 
shall sink at the public house door, 
There is the tankard, I 
see the bright foam, 
Somebody treat me I'm kicked out from home, 
No one to treat me, etc 
Oh, little I 
thought that the woman I'd wed, 
Ever would throw pewter pots at my bead, 
And little I 
dreamed that her mother so dear, 
E'er tasted a 
beverage stronger than beer; 
Scalding hot tea is very good in its place, 
But not so nice when its thrown in your face ; 
Now I've DO use for a 
brush or comb 
They've had all my hair, and Tin kicked out from home. 
No one to treat me, etc 
Oh, where shall I 
go, I'm wet to the skin, 
My boots are in holes, and my coat very thin ; 
My wife and my mother, I 
haven't a 
doubt, 
Are feasting themselves upon steaks and stout; 
The friends of the poor at the workhouse I'll see, 
He'll look with a 
pitying eye upon me, 
I'll ring at the bell till the partner shall come, 
To show me to bed, for I'm kicked out from home. 
No one to treat me, etc.

HOW PADDY'S REPRESENTED. 
I'VE just arrived from Dublin to-night, and feel quite discon-
tented, 
To see the way we are run down, not fairly represented, 
it seems to be a 
general rule to make poor Pat a 
rogue and fool ; 
But never mind, l'll take it cool, and stick up for Oukl Ireland. 
CHORUS. 
So do me justice, treat me fair, I'll not be discontented, 
Nor yet be snubbed everywhere, when fairly represented. 
They say I've dirty and lazy got, but at that I'll never grumble, 
Just go and visit an Irish cot, you're welcome though it's hum-
ble, 
In public works through the country round in railway tunnels 
or underground, 
Or where hard work is to be found, you'll find the boys from 
Ireland. 
So do me, etc. 
Now there in his literature, the cause it grieves me sadly, 
Whenever he draws our caricature, he pictures us rather badly, 
With crooked legs, and villainous face, he represents the Irish 
race, 
I'm sure it is a 
sad disgrace, we think so in Ould Ireland. 
So do me, etc. 
Sure it is very well known, that an Irishman is gay and frisky, 
I'll own that I'm fond of a 
pretty girl, and I 
like a 
drop of 
whiskey. 
I'll do what I 
like with what's me own, I'm very quiet if let 
alone, 
But we hate the foes, Och-hone, who dare to run down OuId 
Ireland. 
So do me, etc.
