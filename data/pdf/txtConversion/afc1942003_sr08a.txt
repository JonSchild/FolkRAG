"Dear Mr. President", Austin, Texas, January or February 1942
AFS 6405A
P.H. Bullry: This is P. H. Bullry, 2000 South First, Austin, Texas. Mr. Roosevelt, I think from talking to
the people we are one hundred percent behind you in winning the war. And our trouble is that we
think that prices is going too high for us. [pause] I think there ought to be something done in raising
prices ???. [something unintelligible said to interviewer]
Frank W. McBee: Dear Mr. President, I am Frank W. McBee, Justice of the Peace of precinct number
five, Travis County, Texas. I contact people from all over this county everyday, and I want you to know
they're all behind you one hundred percent. It is my opinion, that one of the biggest problems in this
community is the rising price of groceries. People in this community are joining the military forces
and buying stamps and bonds everyday. As local commander of Disabled American Veterans, we
as an organization are doing our best to assist in the conservation of materials and to assist you in
every way.
