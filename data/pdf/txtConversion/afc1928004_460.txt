Entered according to Act of Congress, in the year 1879, by A. J. 
FISHER, in the Office of the Librarian of Congreso, at Washington. 
Hebrew Politicians. 
Written by DAVE HOWARD, and sung with great success by HOWARD 
and THOMPSON at thc Windsor Theatre. 
Here we are two Hebrew politicians, 
When we run for office we got terrible opposition 
From every creed that is known in existence, 
We are the Hebrew politicians of the day. 
When election time does come, lots of promises we do 
make; 
You should see them Hebrew voters how our money 
they do take, 
To go and cast their ballots, ' cause they know we take 
the cake, 
We're the Hebrew politicians of the day. 
CHORUS. 
When we go out we dress up nice and neat, 
We eat a 
piece of garlic, to make our breath smell 
sweet; 
And the gang upon the corner holler, " Sheeneys, float 
your feet," 
We're the Hebrew politicians of the day. 
We are going to run for Alderman upon the next elec-
tion; 
Cast your eyes upon us—do you think we'll pass in-
spection ? 
And if you want to vote for us, we won't have no 
objection, 
We're the Hebrew politicians of the day. 
And when we are elected we will do the best we can, 
We'll give a 
good day's wages to every working man; 
And the people all will say, " For them Sheeneys hip, 
hurrah, 
They're the Hebrew politicians of the day." 
When we go out, &c.

Glass . Put In. 
Written by DAvr. HOWARD, and sung by him in" Glasi Put In," 
Here I 
am, a 
Hebrew man, 
And glass I'll put in cheap; 
For fifteen cents a 
single pane, 
You bet I'll do it neat. 
I'll put them in most any size, 
And my price is very small; 
So, if you want some glass put in, 
I'll go and give you a 
call. 
CHORUS. 
0, glass put in. 
Say, glass put in? 
Say, missus, you want some glass put in ? 
I'll do the job so nice and clean, 
You'll find that I'm no cheat; 
0, glass put in. 
Say, glass put in ? 
Say, mister, you want some glass put in ? 
That's what I 
holler the whole day long, 
As I 
go through the street. 
The gang they throw big stones at me 
Whenever I 
go out, 
And from the windows in the street 
You can hear the people shout: 
Say, mister, here, and mister, there, 
I 
want to give you a 
job; 
Because I 
put them in so fine, 
And they know that I'm no slob. 
0, glass put in, Scc. 
Written and sung by DAVE HOWARD. 
My name it is Solomon Cohn, 
I 
keep a 
large clothing store, 
And a 
daughter I've got—only one— 
And she's got my whole body sore. 
She goes to the show every night, 
No longer this I 
will stand sir, 
If I 
say anything to her, she'll say, 
" 
I'm a 
great ballet dancer." 
CHORUS. 
On the stage her name is Schlimosky, 
Her right name is Rachel Schlivensky ; 
She comes home every night, and bully blind tight, 
With a 
pair of black eyes she's a 
terrible sight ; 
She is my only daughter, she drinks nothing but Croton 
water. 
She's got a 
big nose, you could hang on your clothes, 
And the pride of the ballet is Rachel. 
She's going to get married next week 
.To a 
handsome song- and-dance actor, 
And he says he'll make her look sweet 
When she's a 
good ballet dancer. 
He'll make her go around on her toes, 
Over in Niblo's Theatre; 
But she's got such a 
terrible nose, 
I 
don't think the managers will take her.' 
On the stage her name, 8cc, 
Isaac and Moses. 
Written by DAVE HOWARD, and sung by HOWARD and Tnotarsoti 
nightly at Tony Pastor's Theatre. 
We keep a 
store in Baxter street, 
Our business we know well, 
And if you wait a 
little while 
A 
story we will tell 
About a 
fellow that come to us, 
He wanted to buy a 
coat; 
So help my Jimmy Christmas 
You never saw such a 
bloke. 
CHORUS. 
Isaac and Moses sells old clotheses, 
Down in Baxter street; 
No matter when you go that way 
Our wives you're sure to meet ; 
They'll holler out, and then they'll say: 
" 
What shall we sell to you ? 
We've got some very fine clothes inside 
We'll sell for a 
dollar or two. 
He made us show him all the coats 
That we had in the store ; 
We pulled them out, we pulled them in, 
Till we couldn't pull any more. 
So we told him if he didn't go out 
We'd give him such a 
bang; 
Now, what do you think he done just then ? 
He brought in all his gang. 
The Levy Brothers. 
Written expressly for my friends HOWARD and THOMPSON. 
Respectfully, 
JAKE ISAACS. 
We are the Levy brothers, and what money we have made 
Was in the dry goods and the old clothes line. 
We could sell you some rich laces or fine pink calicoes, 
And we warrant every one of them so fine, 
On the shelves we got suspenders, neckties, collars and bows, 
Old hats, garters, and sleeve buttons, too ; 
Take them at cost prices, for, my gracious, they are cheap, 
And every word we tell you it is true. 
CHORUS. 
We got dusters, and big ulsters, 
To hide bad actors' clothes from people's view; 
If you want to buy come give us a 
try, 
In Baxter street the number's twenty-two. 
There's Alexander, our brother, he keeps a 
big pawn shop, 
That's where the sports and gamblers all do go 
With their diamonds and their watches and their sealskin 
overcoats ; 
For the faro bank the money all does go. 
Three balls is the sign, and the number it is nine, 
Terms cash is on the slate upon the wall. 
He is worth, we are told, ten thousand dollars in gold; 
If you want to hock just go and give him a 
call.

byDAYE H OWARD, and sung nightly with inimense• applause by 
H OWARD and T 
HOM YSON. 
Just look at us Hebrew soldiers now, 
And you will plainly see 
We only joined a 
regiment 
About two weeks or three. 
We march in style and the ladies all smile, 
And call us their little dears, 
When we get out upon parade 
With the Isaac Musketeers. 
CHORUs. 
You should. see us on Troadway when we do march so gay, 
The people shout and holler out we are queers; 
But we don't care for that, for we are getting fat 
Since we joined the Solomon Isaac Musketeers. 
Now when the fighting time does come, 
We'll show what we can do ; 
We'll destroy a 
thousand matze!; 
In less than an hour or two. 
We'll put them down without a 
frown, 
And then we won't look queer; 
'Tis the only thing to stimulate 
The Isaac Musketeers. 
You should see us, &c.

Where was Solomon Isaacs when the 
Loafers Stole the Geese. 
Written and sung by D AVE H OWARD. 
I'm a 
quiet Hebrew man, 
My business I 
know well, 
And if you wait a 
little while 
My troubles I 
will tell. 
It's about a 
gang that hangs around, 
And me they always teaze; 
And if I 
only turn my head 
From the cellar they steal my geese. 
CHORUS. 
Where was Solomon Isaacs when the loafers stole the geese ? 
Where was Solomon Isaacs when the loafers stole the geese ? 
What was he about when they cracked him in the snout ? 
Where was Solomon Isaacs when the loafers stole the geese ? 
They kicked me all around the place, 
Until my head was sore ; 
They wasn't satisfied with that, 
They want to give me more. 
My wife went almost crazy then 
From -hollering out ' Police ! 
There goes a 
gang of robbers there. 
They stole my husband's geese !" 
Where was Solomon Isaacs, &c. 
To the court next day I 
went, 
My wife Rachel and I. 
The judge says "-What's your business 'here, 
What makes that woman cry?" 
I 
said, Oh, - 
judge, good Mr. Judge, 
Jut listen if You please: - 
A gangpf giraffes hangs round thy store, 
And they always steel my geese." .

Skinny Tight Pants. 
Written and sung by M. ThomPsoN. 
Good-evening to you, one and all, 
I 
am glad to see you well; 
If you listen to me a 
little while, 
My troubles I 
will tell. 
It's all about my blackguard boy, 
I'll tell while I've got a 
chance 
How he has gone to the bad entirely 
Since he wears the skinny tight pants. 
CHORUS. 
He's out all night till broad daylight, 
At every picnic and dance; 
He's gone to the bad entirely 
Since he wears the skinny tight pants. 
He came home here the other night, 
And loudly began to bawl, 
Saying, " Mother, come give me my supper quick, 
For I 
going to Wallahalla Hall." 
I 
says, " What's going on there to-night ?" 
" 
Don't you know," says he, " there's a 
dance r 
Indeed, I 
needn't expect anything else 
When you're cleaning your skinny tight pants. 
He is out all night, &c. 
Now I 
am told he carries a 
pop, 
And dances the trallaloo; 
You ought to see him when he's all dressed up, 
Promenading the Avenue. 
The girls are all dead mashed on him, 
And with him they love to dance, 
For his legs look like a 
pair of clothes pins 
When he has on his skinny tight pants. 
He is out all night, 8,:c. 
Now I'll bid you all good-by, 
As my song is at an end; 
If there's anybody here with skinny tight pants, 
I 
hope none of you I 
did offend. 
Now, if you are going to a 
party, 
A 
picnic, or a 
dance, 
Take my advice, if you want to look nice, 
Don't WM 
auy skinny tight pants. 
Hc is out all night, &c. 
Subelski's Daughter. 
Written and sung by DAVE HOWARD. 
One evening lately I 
run out quickly 
To buy some fish for a 
Friday night; 
I 
went to Subelski's to buy some plunkeys, 
And what I 
saw there was a 
terrible sight. 
There was pike fish, pickerel, and plunkeys, 
And mackerel that had a 
terrible smell ; 
A 
pound for two cents, three, or five cents, 
However they eat them I 
cannot tell. 
CHORUS. 
There's Subelski, the political speaker, 
In Tammany Hall, boys, he's got a 
pull 
I'll keep away from Subelski's fish store 
Friday noon, when the store is full. 
Subelski's daughter drinks Croton water, 
But she won't refuse a 
glass of beer; 
She is, like her father, a 
big wind bladder, 
And a 
crushed politician's beyond compare. 
He will run for Assembly or Congress 
On our coming election day; 
I'll put my vote in for Isaac Subelski, 
And he'll get elected to stay away. 
There's Subelski, &e.

The Day 1 
Bought the Fish. 
Written and sung by DAVE HOWARD in " The Rival Clothes Dealers." 
I 
walked around the street one day 
To buy some fish without any pay; 
You get them very fine, they say, 
But I 
don't care for that. 
The first thing that attracted me 
Was the name of Isaac I3oronofsky, 
To say the name it puzzled me 
The day I 
bought the fish. 
I 
asked him the kind of fish he had, 
Pike, pickerel, suckers, smelts or shad. 
You say that again you make me mad— 
'Twas then I 
got afraid. 
'Twas then he struck me with a 
stiff, 
And called me a 
regular Hebrew thief; 
On my left eye I 
put some beef 
The day I 
bought the fish. 
He threw some water on me quick, 
And tried to make me then to speak, 
And he put some ice around my feet— 
He thought he killed me sure. 
When all at once I 
made a 
leap, 
And struck Boronofsky in the teeth; 
His wife hollered out " Police ! police 
The day I 
bought the fish. 
I 
run so quick I 
couldn't stop, 
When all at once I 
made a 
flop; 
Into Croton water I 
took a 
drop, 
I-thought he had me sure. 
When all at once he made a 
jump, 
To snatch a 
Croton water pump, 
- And he struck me right square on the konk 
The day I 
bought the fish.

DOT LITTLE SIDE DOOR. 
Written by En. HARRIGAN, for BONNIE RUNYELLS, and sung by 
him at the Theatre Comique, Broadway, N Y. 
I 
keep a 
lager beer saloon 
Up in Avenue A, 
By dein Exercise Commissioners, 
My license dere I 
pay; 
I 
have to put my shutters up, 
Dey say I 
broke der law, 
But I 
got a 
trick dot makes dem sick, 
By dot little old side door. 
CHORUS. 
Dot door is made of iron, 
Mit bolts und bars und lock, 
De signal for to get inside 
Is dree kicks und a 
knock; 
tind yen the police come outside, 
My little broder-in-law, 
Says, " Cheese it, stop! here comes der cop, 
Tie loose der little side door." 
What kind of freedom is dot now, 
Vere you make a 
man keep dry, 
Do you s'pose a 
feller can live all day, 
On turkey, beans und pie? 
Vould you make him drink ice-
vater, 
Till de blood runs from his eyes? 
I 
told you here, give me my beer, 
Und dam de Exercise. 
Dot door, etc. 
I've got some friends in Albany 
In de legislature stout, 
I 
voted for dem seven times, 
To kick de license out; 
Out I'm arrested, I 
told you, 
I'll know de ifs und whys, 
I'll get me full, I

I'll bounce de Exercise.

Why don't dey stop de farmer 
From raising any wheat?

Words by JOHN T. 
RUTLEDGE. 
They say I'm the leader of fashion, 
That no one with me can compare; 
You can tell by the style that I 
dress in, 
If you meet me, wherever you are; 
The ladies all smile on me sweetly, 
A. thing that I 
most dearly love; 
You can hear them remark as they meet me, 
He's a 
nobby young fellow, by Jove! 
CHORUS. 
Yes, he's a 
nobby, he's handsome and winning, 
The dear little fellow I 
love ; 
The ladies all say as they meet me, 
He's a 
nobby young fellow, by Jove 
I 
am counted sweetest of waltzers, 
At boating they say I'm immense; 
I 
bet on the favorite horses, 
I 
am gifted with lots of good sense; 
I 
move in the bon- ton society, 
I'm counted a 
lucky young cove; 
Its a 
saying wherever I 
wander, 
He's a 
nobby young fellow, by Jove! 
Yes, he's a 
nobby, Sr.c_ 
I 
go to the watering places, 
To live through the hot weather spell; 
Make love to the sweetest of faces, 
A 
pastime I 
like mighty well ; 
My lot in this life is a 
nice one, 
In fact it has long been the case; 
I 
have really more fun than the next one. 
Don't you wish you could step in my place? 
Yes, he's a 
nobly, &e. 
His Heart was True to Foil. 
AIR :—" In 1869." 
I 
heard my aunt once sing a 
chant, 
Which now p'r'aps isn't new, 
Of Billy Kidd, who, whatever he did. 
To his Poll was always true. 
He sailed away in a 
gallant ship 
From the pretty port of jovial Bristd, 
And the last words as he uttered, 
While his handkerchee he fluttered, 
Were "My heart is true to Poll." 
My heart is true to Poll, (
busintss) 
No matter what you do, 
If your heart is ever true, 
And his heart was true to Poll. 
They were wrecked. William, to shore he swam, 
And he looked about for an inn, 
When a 
noble savage lady, of a 
color rather shady, 
Came up, with a 
cheerful grin ; 
Says she, "Marry me, and a 
king you'll be, 
And in a 
palace loll, 
Or they'll eat you like a 
filet ;" 
So be gave his hand, did Billy; 
But his heart was true to Poll. 
My heart is true to Poll, &c. 
So William Kidd a 
happy life led 
As the King of the Kikaroos, 
He had nothing but a 
hat upon his head, 
And a 
pair of over-shoes. 
They made him a 
present of twenty wives, 
Which their beauties I 
cannot now extol; 
But one day they all revolted, 
So he back to Bristol bolted, 
For his heart was true to Poll.

Price lo cents. 
He isn't as rich as he used to be, 
his friends, they are growing few; 
When jolly and gay. in the days gone by, 
He found them a 
little too true. 
He wanders alone thro' the street so gay, 
And meets here and there a 
cool bow; 
But the friends of his pleasure in days gone by, 
Having nothing to say to him now. 
CHORUS. 
For he isn't as rich as he used to be, 
He's " down in the world," to- day • 
He knows what it is to be poor, my boys, 
And he meets not a 
friend in nis way. 
He sported himself like a 
prince around, 
And became a 
great friend of " the boys," 
Whenever his presence was known to them, 
They set up a 
flattering noise. 
The ladies all smiled as he passed them by, 
Their wishes he well could attend; 
He was loved and caressed like an angel blest, 
Because he had money to spend., 
For he isn't, A

At night, in convivial joys he lived, 
And slumbered each day until noon, 
He rode in his coach with a 
lady fair, 
And went off to the country in June; 
But now, no one knows where he lives or goes, 
Some forget him and others despise, 
lie feels the hard times, but he'll bear them well, 
Till, seine day, in his garret he dies, 
For he isn't, kr,. 
DID YOU BITER FEEL THAT WAY? 
As sung by TONY P&STOR. 
Entered according to Act of Congress, in the year 1875, by A..1. Fisu-
ER, in the ° nice of the Librarian of Congress, at Washington. 
YOU'VE read no doubt a 
thousand times how people fall in love, 
Well my heart has been took prisoner by a 
little turtle dove; 
One Sunday morn in Spring time when birds sung from each 
tree, 
'Twas then I 
s--
-=p, aemima, and it was all U. P. with me. 
SPOKEN. — Yes. the very moment she sent one of her side 
glances at me, there was such a 
queer sensation came- 
over me, 
like—ah—like—aL. well I 
cannot explain ; but— 
CHORUS. 
I 
felt tto very peculiar, my brain spun like a 
top, 
'Cy bosom burned like pepper sauce, I 
felt so very hot, 
And then I 
felt so very cold, its the way with love they say; 
Oh, the feelings so peculiar, did you ever feel that way? 
In conversation we soon got, and walked on si le by side, 
And my heart was filled with gladness to see her blush with 
pride, 
T 
begged I 
might accompany and see her on the way, 
When she replied in such sweet tones, " yes, thanks, kind sir, 
you may," 
SPOKEN. — The moment she said yes, oh! 
I 
feel so very peculiar, etc. 
I 
often met her after that, my own, my guiding star, 
And now she has consented, and the time's not very far 
When two souls with but a 
single thought, two hearts that-bee-1 
as one, 
Will be tied in such a 
knot, dear boys, not easily undone. 
SPOKEN.—Ever since she consented I'm always going through 
the ceremony of, will you take this woman to be your wedded 
wife ? 
And when I 
reply, yes, to myself— 
CHORUS. 
I 
feel so very peeuliar, my brain spins like a 
top, 
My bosom burns like pepper sauce, I 
feel so very hot, 
And then I 
feel so very cold, it's the way with love they say; 
Oh, the feelings so peculiar, did you ever feel that way ? 
The time has been appointed, invitations they are sent, 
And to have a 
glorious time, dear boys, it is my sole intent, 
I 
am here to night on purpose, for Jemima has sent me 
To ask you all to come and join us in our wedding spree. 
SPOKEN.—Oh 
boys, when I 
think about it, I 
feel a  ; well 
justjancy yourselves the other half of a 
girt like my Jeminta, 
and the father of a 
hemale boy, and a 
sheinale girl, one little 
cherub on this knee pulling your nose ar.d saying pap— papa, 
and the other little cherub on this knee pulling your hair, and 
saying dad—dada. 
Oh the thoughts of it makes me feel so I—

MY MARY ANN. 
Words and Music by TIM ROGERS. As sung by him with great 
success, at Harrigan & Hart's, Theatre Coraique. 
I'VE got a 
sweet-heart, she looks like a 
queen, 
Her hair it is red, and her age is sixteen, 
She's from Kildare, she's not very green, 
She's one of the fairest your eyes ever seen, 
She sings " Eilleen Allanna," plays on the piano, 
With a 
voice soprano, that's cozy and sweet, 
But when she sits down to play " Lakes of Killarney" 
She frightens the children off of the street. 
CHORUS. 
You should see Mary, she's light as a 
fairy, 
Sings like a 
canary, from ould Tipperary, 
She is not airy, she attends to the dairy, 
She's never contrary, my own Mary Ann. 
I 
took lovely Mary one night to a 
ball, 
To a 
massacred hop, down to W 
alhalla Hall; 
She swung the side quadrille the best of them all, 
But get her to dance, faith I 
couldn't at all. 
Says I, lovely Mary, will you waltz the next quadrille ? 
Says she, excuse me, Levi, I'm losing my health. 
Her corns they did ache her, she took off her shoe, 
And in two minute's time she had the ball to herself. 
You should see Mary, etc. 
When the dancing was over, some man sung a 
song, 
And in popped a 
nagur, and struck a 
big gong, 
He shouted out fire, and she flew straight along.. 
She fell down the steps, and I 
thought she was gone; 
I 
caught her and convinced her the gong went for supper, 
She sat down to the table, and done it up brown, 
The fruit that she eat was onions and garlic; 
The perfume from her breath would knock a 
man down. 
You should see Mary, etc. 
MY GAL PARODY. 
MY Sal. my Sal, I'll perambulate to her domicile, 
For I 
ain't got any other occupation to bother me; 
Pse gwine to see this concentrated conglomeration of caw 
To drive away my low spiritiveness. 
My Sally dear is a 
scrumptious sort of a 
female ; 
We's gwine before the preachermans presently, 
And then we'll agitate our pendal extremities 
By the sound of the integuments of the feline intestines. 
Cnoars. 
Well display our terpsichorean proclivities, 
We'll exercise our vocalistic abilities, 
We'll shout till de risin ob de boss illuminations, 
Then pedestrinate to our proper professions, 
At de sound of de two cent fish horn. 
My coal black Sal is as lively as a 
hoppergrass ; 
She can agitate her pendal extremities quite lovely ? 
You ought to observe•our old mule scratch gravel and get awsi 
within himself. 
When I 
take this bunch of shoe black out for an airing; 
She can wash, she can talk in six dead languages, 
She can trimble trouble all the sewing machines that took the 
gold medal, 
Wear out your bronchial tube; we's gwine before de preacher-
mans 
To be harnessed in the bonds of hemlock this evening. 
We'll display, 
%Written by BOB ax NEWCOMB expressly for Winn H. Moirroic, America's 
Comique. 
When a 
little boy I 
wandered,'twas a 
pleasant summer's 
day, 
My heart was like a 
feather as I 
journeyed on my way, 
To my eager footsteps soft. the green grass laid, 
With a 
little playmate, such a 
tiny maid, 
Playing I 
war, poor man, playing she wa4-, 
rich, 
flow her merry laughter reached the highest pitch, 
Pointing to the daisies silver wealth untold, 
Buttercups unnumbered, these she said were gold. 
With the time departing soon the air was chilled, 
Out upon the crisp wind loud the robin thrilled, 
Onc3 again I 
wandered with my little maid, 
To our treasure garden vast in wealth arrayed, 
Soon we knew a 
robber, Jack Frost was his name, 
had been there before us and taken all our gain 
With his icy fingers and a 
grasp so cold 
Stole our silver daises and buttercups of gold. 
Man's estate I 
reached then, but I 
ne'er forgot 
My little maid companion and our treasure spot, 
For there was a 
lesson in our strange belief, 
Summer was our banker, Winter was our thief, 
So it is with friends, then sometimes so with all, 
They're true to us in sunshine but leave us in the fall, 
When a 
warm friend slights me or he treats me cold, 
I 
think of silver daisies and buttercups of gold. 
Oh, mother, what do they mean by blue, 
And what do they mean by gray. 
Was heard from the lips of a 
little child, 
As she bounded in from play. 
The mother's eyes filled up with tears, 
She turned to her darling fair, 
And smoothed away from the sunny brow, 
Its treasures of golden hair. 
Why, mother's eyes are blue my sweet, 
And grabdpa's hair is grey, 
And the love we bear our darling child, 
Grows stronger every day; 
But what did they—persisted the child— 
For I 
saw two cripples to-day, 
And one of them said he fought for the blue, 
The other, he fought for the gray. 
Now, he of the blue had lost a 
leg, 
The other had but one arm; 
And both seemed worn and weary and sad, 
Yet their greeting was kind and warm. 
They told of battles of days gone by, 
Till it made my v—ing blood thrill. 
The leg w9".
..,,st in the Wilderness fight, 
_ And the arm en Malvern Bill. 
They sat on the stone by the farm-yard gate, 
And talked for an hour more, 
Till their eyes grew °right, and their warm hearts seemed, 
With fighting their battles o'er, 
And parting at last with a 
friendly grasp. 
In a 
kindly, brotherly way; 
Each called on God, to speed the time, 
Uniting the blue and the gray.

THE Spring has skedaddled, July had come, 
And the chickens had ceased to lay, 
Down by a 
puddle in Central Park, 
I 
first saw Sally Gray. 
She had a 
nice, bully, glass-eye, 
And was romping all the day, 
And I 
dearly loved, at.sight, this girl. 
Whose mane was Sally Gray, 
Cnoaus. 
My frisky, frisky, Sally, Sally, 
Romping all the day, oh 
I'll bet my life there's not a 
girl 
Can equal Sally Gray. 
As Sal walked out one afternoon. 
About ten o'clock at night, 
She met a 
tall man dressed in blue, 
Who said that I 
was ti5ht. 
Be also said I 
was a 
beat, 
My bills I 
could not pay, 
But my purse is in the care of one, 
And that is Sally Gray. 
My frisky, itc.. 
In the faro bank for Sally's sake, 
My cash I 
put away, 
That I 
some day to cupid's shrine, 
May take sweet Sally Gray. 
For she's dead gone on me, 
And as time it flies away, 
I 
shall often think of the puddle in the Park, 
Where first I 
met Sally Gray.

ne had ventured all in that bounding ark 
That (

But his heirt was young, and his spirit light, 
And he dashed the tear away, 
As he watched the shore recede from sightl 
Of his own sweet Dublin Bay.

original Irish Comedy farce, entitled " O'Donne12's Victory." 
Dundreary O'Donnell is my name, 
I'm a 
man of great renown, 
It's just about twinty years ago, 
Since I 
landed in this town; 
An' since that time I 
a 
family raised, 
Which I'm very proud to tell, 
An' in this city iver since. 
Wid me frinds I've had to dwell. 
CHORUS. 
Dundreary O'Donnell is my name, 
An' all the people say. 
I'm the coming man of this great place--
The rest have had their day. 
As I 
walked out this mornin', 
Sure all the people said— 
" 
There goes O'Donnell, the candidate. 
By him we're to be led, 
Arrali! he's the man that'll rule New York, 
An' won't he cut a 
shine— 
Whin he goes over to Washington, 
As a 
Senator so finer 
Dundreary O'Donnell, etc. 
Now that the election is over, 
An' tho glorious battle is won, 
My kindest thanks I 
offer to those, 
For the work they have done: 
And whin I 
take my sate, my frinds, 
The public thin I'll show— 
That Dundreary O'Donnell is the people's choice, 
Wherever he may go.

BACK PROM THE MASQUERADE, 
You see that I 
have returned, 
From the Grand Masquerade; 
And oh! such jolly times I've had, 
In the dance and promenade; 
And such a 
nice young man I 
had, 
Rut his name I 
do not know; 
Now I 
feel so very bad, 
For lie might have been my beau. 
Ms hair was tilack and curly, 
His eyes were clear and bright; 
His dress so well became him, 
For he played a 
gallant Knight; 
The sweetest words he whispered, too, 
As we walked to and fro ; 
But now I 
feel so dreadful bad, 
I'm afraid I've lost my beam 
But he promised lie would meet me, 
At some other Masquerade ; 
Zhen I'll be sure to learn his name, 
When on the Grand Parade. 
Ilut he promised he would meet me, 
At some other Masquerade ; 
Then I'll be sure to learn his name, 
When on the Grand Parade. 
SO early in the morning my sweetheart Rosy May, 
Rose to make her pudding- upon the Christmas day ; 
The prettiest girl of any, whatever people say, 
And while she mix'd her padding, she sung this Christ-
mas lay 
Cnortus. 
Currants and Plums! citron and crumbs! 
The best way to mix it's with lingers and thumbs. 
I 
rose betimes that morning, and went to wish my dear. 
A 
merry, merry Christmas and a 
happy glad new year : 
I 
look'd in at her lattice, she didn't notice me.

But humard and mixed her pudding like a little husy bee.

watcli'd her pick the raisins and wash the currants o'er 
I 
blessed her tiny fingers while they dabbled in the flour ; 
But when she'd chopped the suet, put the big pot on the grate. 
I 
sung this Christmas carol for I 
could no longer wait. 
Currants and Plums, . 
My darting little Rosy blusli'd a 
rosy, rosy red, 
She left her Christmas pudding and hung down her pretty 
head ; 
Then looking up. she clapped aloft, her floury hands in glee. 
Crying-" Come and see the pudding, love, I've made for you 
and me." 
Currants and Plums, Sc. 
We put the pudding in the pot, and watch'd it Mille it boiled : 
For a 
Christmas pudding left alone's a Christmas pudding 
spoiled ; 
Then side by side before the fire, with many a 
loving kiss, 
We passed the happy hours away, and sung a 
ehant like 
this. 
Currants and Plums. ,t;e. 
Of Christmas puddings in my time, I've tasted many a 
score. 
But I 
never tasted pudding half so good as this before : 
And I've got a 
precious promise, from my darling Rosy May-
To make another pudding on our happy wedding day.

America the Land of the Free! 
Written and sung by Mn. Tom HAIIPX1,1. 
Reepectfully dedicated to the Veterans of the e,t/th New York 
Regiment Volunteers. • 
Oh! I've lately come from America, the land of the brave 
and free ! 
Where peace and plenty now does reign; 
And an Irishman, there, is as good as any one, 
Although he may be a 
little green. 
When first I 
crossed the water and landed on their shore. 
They extended then, to me, a 
welcome hand; 
And they said, you're welcome here, your country to nit ix 
dear, 
And we love you, the Irishman. 
Then hurrah for America, the land of the free! 
Sure that's the place, my boys, where there is no 
slavery. 
Ob I 
had not been there very long when a 
war broke out. 
And spread its desolation over the land; 
When they called upon the Irishman to help go and fight. 
I 
gave to them, then, a 
helping hand ; 
I 
enlisted in the ranks with many a 
noble man, 
Along with brave Corcoran and his noble crews 
And they marched us down South to what they call Dixie's 
land, 
To fight for the Red. White and Blue ! 
Then hurrah for America, 1.c. 
There is a 
nation that's been trying to cause America 
trouble, 
Of course, I 
mean the country called Spain! 
But she'd better mind her business or she soon will see, 
What is her loss will be America's gain; 
For with Cuba annexed unto the United States, 
We'll add to their banner another star ; 
And I 
hope that Ireland soon will, like America be free! 
And you bet, the time is not so very far. 
Then hurrah for Am 
erka,

There's a 
message from the many, 
From the many- to the few, 
Toiling millions ask for justice 
From the rich, which is their due; 
honest workers toiling, sighing, 
Crowning hearts as true as steel, 
suffering, starving, groaning, dying, 
'Neath oppression's iron heel. 
CitoRus. 
Then give to the poor 
The hand of free good will, 
And help your struggling brother 
To climb life's rugged hill; 
Truth makes the man, 
And not his money bags, 
For crime oft stands in broadcloth. 
Whilst honesty's in rags. 
To the rich the poor are step-stones, 
. Stepping stones to fortune's dower, 
Ever grinding down their wages. 
Up they mount to wealth and power; 
Oh, ye purse- proud sons of mammon, 
Whilst you o'er your riches gloat, 
Don't forget that honest people 
Qften wear a 
ragged coat.

There's a 
maxim to remember 
If in life you would succeed ; 
It is very plain and simple, 
It will serve you as a 
creed: 
If your courage should desert you, 
And you feel your hopes grow dim, 
Bear in mind this little motto : 
" 
Never venture, never win." 
CHORUS. 
On, on, on, and never be afraid, boys; 
On, on, on, with courage as your aid. boys 
Try for the best, keep a 
cheerful heart within. 
Bear in mind this little motto : 
" 
Never venture, never win." 
When our fathers fought for freedom— 
And that boon was long denied— 
They beheld their foes retreating, 
And with death were satisfied ; 
They were true, and never weakened 
In the battle's wildest din, 
For Cley knew that little motto : 
" 
Never venture, never win." 
On, on, on, Scc.., 
When the lover sues for kisses, 
And the sweetheart is unkind, 
Don't depend upon her answer 
If she seems the least inclined ; 
She may say that you are naughty, 
And that kissing is a 
sin ; 
But you know she never means it— 
If you venture you will win.

With eyes the brightest blue 
Beneath her dark eyelashes, 
Like violets dipped in dew.

She smiled so sweet upon me, (symi..h.) 
That moment she had won me, 
'Twas love the first I

There some sweet charm entrancing, 
With this dear girl so fair, 
A 
rosy, soft expression, 
With a 
mass of Golden Hair. 
Now, I 
followed on behind her, 
I 
think she knew it well, 
And as a 
sweet reminder, 
Her handkerchief it fell ; 
raised the scented linen 
From off the grassy ground ; 
Her name, in letters crimson, 
On one corner then I 
found. 
Kt length I 
did approach her, 
And ventured in the task, 
By asking her permission 
To join her lonely walk; 
She blushing, frowning. smiling, 
Said, oh! I 
think you rude, 
But those blue eyes, beguiling, 
Seemed to say, I 
wish you wovil.

Pray never go back on the flag. 
Tf you take this advice you will surely find 
A 
blessing you'll find in the end; 
A

If to your duty you do well attend.

And to crime they will let themselves drag; 
But be honest and unright, and above all you do. 
Pray never go back on the flag.

It was under that flag. that Benjamin Franklin was born. 
A

Though poor at the first, yet himself he did raise,

And if he's minus health, my boys,

So this advice I

Learn joyfully to live, my boys,

Never hit a

NEVER PRACTICE WHAT THEY PREACH. 
Written and Sung by SAM DrvrcuR. 
Some people think its nice, 
To give other folks advice. 
Their tongues are running morning, noon and night. 
They'll stop you in the street, 
Anywhere you chance to meet. 
Just to tell you what they thing is wrong or right. 
Though in luxury they may live 
Their advice is all they'll give. 
Their mouths are always open with a 
speech 
They'll tell you how you should, 
In this wic ed world do good. 
But you'll find they never practice what they preach 
Some people yell and cry, 
'Tis an awful thing to lie. 
- Oh, yes, they think its such an awful sin. 
They'll advise you that its fair, 
To be always on the square, 
And try and never t 
uch a 
drop of gin. 
Tell you honesty is best. 
That the wicked have no rest. 
Of course they won't take nothing out of reach. 
Say to lead a 
happy life, 
Spend your evenings with your ;rife. 
But you'll find they never practice whet they preach 
There's the noble working man, 
Who does the best he can. 
To get his family bread from day to day. 
He might work until he'd drop, 
In the fields or in the shop. 
Still not satisfied, they'd try and cut his pay. 
Bread and water is the stuff, 
For the poor its good enough, 
Bat if rich folks had to eat it how they'd seroccli. 
Let them tell it and they'd swear, 
That the rich can live on air. 
But you'll find they never practice w—at they preach.

NEW YORK. 
An original song, written by Hinnt BrNtcrt-r, 
10? 
JOHN PENDY. 
In this the great city, queer sights I 
have seen, 
Arid from them a 
song I 
have managed to gle.an; 
And when you have heard it, no doubt you'll' agree, 
That things in town are not as they should be; 
In the first place, we hear a 
report every day. 
They're going to give us a 
Ila.pid Transit Railway; 
But unless they soon do it, between you and me, 
Things in this town, are not as they should be. 
CTIORUS. 
In New York, New York, 
The place of renown, 
New York City, 
The famous old town. 
The great socibl evil to- day, I've no doubt, 
Is the poor homeless tramp, who goes wandering about. 
Ile cannot find shelter or food, if he tries; 
What cares the cold world, if lie sickens and dies: 
Perhaps in his youth, he'd a 
bright happy home, 
But cruel misfortune has caused him to roam; 
If he can't get employment, he must steal you see, 
Which shows things are not just as they should be. 
In New York, etc. 
Boss Tweed is a 
man most talked about now, 
His departure last winter caused a 
great row; 
Of course we all know it was not a 
square game, 
But show me the man who would not do the same; 
When Sweeny, Genet and Dick Connelly took flight, 
He stood here alone and made a 
good fight; 
He did wrong, but when poor men were grzatly in need. 
The first to assist them was William If. Twced.

NETTLE MOORE. 
Copied by permission of Oerven DrrsoN & Co., Music Dealers, 277 
Washington St., Boston. 
In a 
little white cottage where the trees are ever green, 
And the climbing roses blossom by the door, 
I've often sat and listened to the music of the birds, 
And the gentle voice of pretty Nettie Moore. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, I 
miss you, Nettie Moore, 
And my happiness is o'cr, 
While a 
spirit sad around my heart has come, 
And the busy days are long, 
And the nights are lonely now 
For you are gone from our little cottage home. 
Below us in the valley, on the Santee's dancing tide, 
Of a 
Summer eve I'd launch my open boat; 
And when the moon was rising and the stars began to shine, 
Down the river we so merrily would float. 
Oh, I 
miss you, &c. 
One sunny morn in Autumn, are the dew had left the lawn 
Came a 
trader up front Louisiana bay; 
Who gave to master money, and then shacki'd her with 
chains. 
And then he took her off ft) work her life away. 
Oh, I 
miss you, & e. 
Since that time the world is dreary, and I 
long from earth 
to rise, 
"- And join the happy angels gone before, 
I 
never can 1:e Tnerry, i'or my heart is full of woe, 
And I'm pining for :Li pretty Nettie Moore. 
Oh, . 1 
miss you. 
You are gone, lovely Nettie, and my heart must surely 
break, 
When the tears come no more into my eyes; 
But when weary life is past, I 
shall meet you once again, 
In Heaven, darling, up above the skies. 
Oh, I 
miss you, &e.

Courting Cards.—This Series of Cards has been arrang•sd 
to meet a 
want frequently felt by young people—a 
want of means eif 
expressing one's sentiments in such a way as to be non-committal. 
Many young ladies are visited by gentlemen who are either too 
dent or too fearful of a 
iepulse. to venture upon asking the momentotui 
question. The lady is restrained, by custom and a 
sense of propriety, 
from doing anything that would seem to be an unlady-like encoursge-
anent. 
As a 
result a 
this dilemma, many lives are spent as an unloved 
tedious existence, which might have been prolonged and enjoyed in the 
happiness of matrimony. This pack of Cards will overcome the d1-
faulty, and being in the shape of qLestions and answers, will cover every 
phase of courtship. 
The sentiments conveyed therein need not be 
adopted by the parties to the game as their own, unless it accords with 
the state of their affections, which fact makes further explanation tue. 
necessary. The playing of these Cards is not restricted to two players. 
but may be enjoyed by evening parties
