Old True Love
OLD TRUE LOVE 5143 A3
King Family Visalia, 1941
Went to see my old true love She met me at the door Had her shoes and stockings in her
hand Her feet all over the floor.
Fare thee well, my old true love Fare you well, I say Fare you well, my old true love Ten
thousand miles away.
Went to see my old true love She called me sugar pie She hugged me and she kissed me
I thought to my soul I'd die.
Fare thee well, my old true love Fare you well, I say Fare you well, my old true love Ten
thousand miles away.
Went to see my old true love She met me at the door She knocked me down with a pokin'
stick An' I ain't been back no more.
Fare thee well, my old true love Fare you well, I say Fare you well, my old true love Ten
thousand miles away.
