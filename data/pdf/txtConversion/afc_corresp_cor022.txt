Mr. Harold Spivacke Chief, Division of Music Library of Congress Washington, D. C.
Dear Mr. Spivacke:
I regret that we misinformed you concerning the shipment of needles from Presto. The
shipment consisted of only four needles, as you can see by the enclosed copy of the
shipping order.
As you suggested in your letter of August 21, I immediately instructed Mr. Kennedy and
Mr. Cook to refrain from playing the recording discs more than once or twice, and not to
use them for demonstration purposes. Mr. Kennedy and Mr. Cook left Jacksonville on
August 19, on a recording expedition to Cross City (turpentine workers), Tampa (Latin-
Americans, Itlaian-Americans, and Negroes), Tarpon Springs (Greeks), and Sebring
(native cracker and folk music).
They are now in Tampa and should return to Jacksonville early next week.
The recorded discs shall be mailed to you immediately after the expedition returns to
Jacksonville, at which time I shall also give you a full detailed report on the work of the
expedition.

State Folklore Recording Expedition Arrives Here
A Florida Folklore recording expedition has arrived in Tampa to make phonographic record
of the lore particularly abundant here because of the many racial groups comprising the
city's population.
Although the expedition is especially interested in recording folk songs and music, efforts
also will be made to secure selections of other types of lore. It is sponsored by the Library
of Congress, the WPA Florida Music project and the WPA Florida Writers Project.
Stetson Kennedy, director of folk studies for the WPA Florida Music Project, is field
supervisor of the expedition. Bob Cook of the writers' project is technical operator of the
equipment and is making supplementary photographic studies. Acting as consultants are
Prof. Alton C. Morris, of the University of Florida, considered an authority on Southern
folklore, and Zora Neale Hurston, Negro novelist.
The records will be processed to make them durable and then placed in the Archive of
American Folksong in the Library of Congress. A duplicate set will be kept in the office of
the State Music Project at Jacksonville.

The expedition will be in Tampa for several days, and anyone desiring to submit folk
material for recording should get in touch with the Tampa office of the WPA.
