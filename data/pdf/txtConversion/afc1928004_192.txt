" 
THE COPPER." 
Written and Sung by Jai 
Ant:—" It's Grand." 
Of all the lives I 
ever did see, 
The life of a 
cop is the one for me, 
Its grand, its grand, its grand, its grand 
We drink our glasses and live in clover, 
And we are never seen until the muss is over. 
Its grand, its grand, &c. 
CHORUS. 
For a 
fine life leads the Copper, move on, move on. 
It is a 
delightful course, to get into the force. 
For a 
fine life leads tile Copper, move on, &c. 
For a 
fine life leads the Copper. 
I 
am courting a 
girl in Union Square, 
I 
get lots of hash and good things there, 
Its grand, its grand, &e. 
She brings inc down into the kitchen, 
She sets the table, and then we pitch in. 
Its grand, its grand, &c. 
For a 
fine life, &c. 
Such trying of locks and ringing of bells, 
And going through half drunken swells, 
For its grand, its grand, &c. 
I 
have a 
watch, it is a 
beauty, 
I 
bought it while I 
was on night-duty. 
For its grand, its grand, &c. 
For a 
fine life, &c. 
Now there's a 
Roundstnan in a 
fight, 
I 
must run to his rescue when all is quiet, 
For its grand, its grand, &c. 
Now 1 
see the one that is making the bother, 
He will tip me a 
stamp and I'll collar the other. 
For its grand, its grand, &o. 
For a 
fine life, &c.

BANJO SOLO. 
As sung by Jim O'NEm• 
Oh, I 
once knew a 
girl, about sweet sixteen,. 
She lived on a 
street just above Green, 
Her name was 3Nlatilda Ann Jane Lee, 
And her father sold clams in the cottage by the sea. 
Matilda was the reigning belle ot the town, 
She loved a 
shoemaker named McGowan, 
And McGowan swore he'd have life, 
Or have Matilda for his wife. 
One night Matilda went to a 
ball, 
With a 
clam-soup-man, whose name was McCall, 
She danced three sets and the fourth did begin, 
When all at once McGowan stept in, 
And when he saw his lover there, 
Ile raved, and swore, and tole his hair, 
And challenged the clam-sonp-man of the Hall. 
To fight next day with a 
codfish ball. 
Next day they met on an open lot, 
And the clam-soup-man with a 
fish ball got shot, 
He fell 011 the grass, and he skinned his nose, 
And gave three cheers for the engine hose. 
When Matilda saw her lover felled, 
She jumped into a 
barrel of oyster shells. 
And skinned her shin, and all the bark came off, 
And died next day with the whooping cough. 
VARIETY- BANJO SOLO.. 
As sung by Jim O'NiEL. 
Champagne Charlie is my name, 
I 
like a 
drop of good beer, 
Of all the girls that's in this town 
There's none like Maggie dear. 
With my Maggie by my side, 
I 
just want forty winks, 
I'm lonely since my mother died, 
And so is Captain Jinks. 
Hark I 
hear an angel sing, 
Coming thro' the rye, 
Mother, may I 
go out to swim. 
To root hog or die. 
Come into the garden, Maud, 
Says the Spider to thelly, 
Down among the coals, my boys, 
And how is that for high. 
Old Orange Blossom went to sea 
Along with Pat Molloy, 
They got in tow with the fisher-man's daughter, 
And started off for Squedunek. 
Meet me in the Lane to-night, 
And if you should'nt prove true, 
I'll send you were the Woodbine twinetb, 
nd put a 
head on you, Keno.

‘• THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO KNOW." 
Written and Sung Tay jnt 
White glancing over the papers, 
A few questions cross'd my mind ; 
I 
dropped the paper front my hand,: 
And thus the subject rhymed. 
They are no Air Castles, 
But stern facts, the papers show ; 
Then what will be done in such a 
case, 
That's what I 
want to know. 
CHORUS. 
That's what I 
want to know, 
Is the subject of my song; 
So give your attention and see 
If I 
ant right or wrong. 
Now poor Fisk he got short notice 
To quit this world ot pain 
For by an assassin's hand 
Poor Fisk was brutally 
They say a 
mail with thirty thousand 
Need have no fear 1 
know ; 
Then will Stokes get off with his crime, 
That's, what I 
want to know. 
CHORUS. 
Then can they call this justice. 
When a 
rich man can do so; 
If there's a 
law for rich and one for poor, 
That's what I 
want to know. 
New York in every quarter, 
is in a 
fearful mess; 
They talk of epidemics, 
Well can they wonder at distress. 
Why don't the men in power, 
instead ot pocketing money so; 
Why don't they keep the City clean, 
That's what I 
want to know. 
CHORUS. 
There's thousands- of poor men starving, 
To that work would gladly go; 
Then why don't they give the poor a 
chance, 
,VhatI9.. what I 
want to know. 
IM ALL THE WAY FROM ERIN'S ISLE. 
Written and Sung by Jnit CrNinz. 
I'm all the way from Erin's Isle 
And here I 
mean to stop awhile, 
And all the boys I 
can lick, 
For with my stick I 
can do a 
trick. 
CHORUS. 
For Pat can dance and sing, 
And fight like anything, 
I 
fire away, for the deuce don't care, 
And ever for fun I 
sing. 
With all the girls Pm quite a 
treat, 
Nymph-
And don't they say I 
look so sweet, 
And while I 
am walking down the street, 
Don't they like my pretty feet. 
For Pat, &c. 
So now good evening, one and an, 
Some other night rit give you o. can, 
I'll sing a 
song and praise up home, 
For when I 
get back no more I'll roam. 
For Pat can dance and sing, 
And fight like anything, 
I 
fire away, for the deuce don't care, 
And ever for fun I 
sing.

"BETTER COME AND 'TRY." 
Written aed,Sang by JIM O'Nan., with great success. 
We Americans are sturdy rovers, 
For on land as well as sea ; 
Nearly one hundred years we have traved 
One run of victory; 
In peaceful Arts as well as Science 
All Nations we defy, 
And those'who sneer at our defiance, 
Had better come and try. 
CHORUS. 
And those That'sneer at our defiance, 
Had better come and try. 
Now old John Bull is a 
good old soul, 
Sent some one here to show 
Our yacht:men how to sail their yachts, 
Our Oarsmen how to row. 
But both of them defeated were, 
:Let us have another shy, 
It John Bull thinks he has smarter men 
He had better come and try. 
And those, itte. 
In Cuba there is a 
row just now, 
In Mexico the same— 
And though we have kept our powder dry, 
We will take no slur from Spain, 
And thus while Spain and Cuba fight, 
We will quietly stand by; 
But if they think we.are afraid of them, 
They had better come and try. 
And those, &c. 
There is a 
name known o'er the world, 
Americans love best; 
lie marked our Independence out, 
But now he has gone to rest. 
Washington who planted Freedom's Flag, 
That boldly waves on high. 
And those who'd like to pull it down, 
Had better come and try. 
And those, &c. 
PAT WON'T GO' HOME TILL MORNING. 
The dawn upon the hill was breaking, the stars were 
twinkling in the sky, 
As Pat upon the ground lay dreaming, his big ' shillelah 
lay close by, 
All night the whiskey he's been drinking, and now he 
wakens from his drunken spree, 
He calls for drink to make him frisky, and swears because 
there is no more. 
CHORUS. 
Then fill up the bowl, hurrah! for a 
thirsty soul, ha! ha 
All night on a 
spree, my boys, my throat with fire is 
burning, 
Dance so blythe and gay, hurrah! none like Pat can be, 
ha! ha! 
Divil a 
hair I 
care, my boys, we won't go home till morning. 
The moon upon the bogs was gleaming, and the lambs 
were bleating in the shed, 
The pigs and sows the swill were raking, and the gossoons 
waiting to be fed, 
Pat home from the wake is trudging slowly, with divil a 
farthing in his purse, 
Besides his pockets are both holey, and credit to poOr Pat 
not worth a 
curse. 
Then fill up, &e. 
The night and fun again advances, and the song and dance 
again goes round, • 
And Pat again is nimbly drinking, until with whiskey he 
gets drowned, 
All night he's been swigging at the bottle, awl now he 
tumbles flat upon the floor. 
Yet still the boys and girls are dancing, but Pat's asleep to 
dance no more. 
Then fill up, &c.

THE NEW POLICEDIAN. 
Am 
v—" Nora Creina." 
Oh I 
good evening, gentlemen, to-day— 
Now list awhile to me and my blarney. 
I 
am arrived from Dublin quay, 
Now sure my name is Michael Karney. 
Grub was scarce and luck was bad, 
Hunger's rumbling ne'er did cease, man, 
So to this city I 
came 'egad, 
And Murphy's made me a 
new policeman. 
CEIORUS. 
Ranting, rollicking Irish joys, 
Always quarreling, ne'er at peace, man; 
Kissing the girls and licking the boys, 
Oh! that's the life of a 
new policeman. 
Och I 
there isn't yard or garden wall, 
About the city but I 
can scale it, 
Anil if anything I 
find at all, 
Now shouldn't I 
fool be not to nail it ? 
Next morning there's a 
hue and cry; 
There's something stolen, and to be brief, man. 
Oh I 
by the hookey, who but I 
Am running about to catch the thief, man. 
Ranting, rollicking, & c, 
And then, you know, when I'm out at night 
In every hole and corner peeping, 
What's that I 
spy by the pale moonlight, 
Och I 
by my soul, 'tis a 
gentleman sleeping. 
Ills pockets I 
grope and his money I 
take, 
And then with my staff in the ribs I 
ant jobbing him, 
And if by chance the man should wake, 
I 
tell him I 
thought a 
thief was robbing hini. 
Ranting, rollicking, dic. 
Then if there isn't a 
row in the street, 
Sure it's myself knows how to raise one. 
For, I 
knock the first man down I 
meet, 
Then make a 
shindy fit to craze one. 
He resists, then loud he hollers, 
• I 
lock him up and swear he's rioty. 
Next morning he is fined two dollars, 
' 
Just because myself couldn't murder him quietly. 
Ranting, rollicking, dm 
DAT GAL WITH THE DOLLY VARDEN. 
Wetten and Sung by BILLY ecrrrox. 
AIR 
" Whim the Band Begins to Play." 
I 
once did love a 
yallar gal, her name is Sairah Brown, 
I 
meet her ebery ebening when I 
go to town; 
She wears a 
white lace handkerchief, it's marked with a 
rose in the garden, 
Pll know her if I 
see her, 'kase she's dressed in a 
Dolly 
Varden. 
CHORUS. 
She looks so very funny with her Dolly Varden on, 
With her Dolly Varden on. 
Den I 
was gone. 
She looks so very funny with her Do!ly Varden on, 
Dolly Varden, Dolly Varden on. 
I 
met her in the street one day, she looked at me so sly; 
And I 
began to talk to her, she hit me in the eye; 
Then she jumped and pitched, and I 
thought she was 
carden, 
It was because I 
stepped on her little Dolly Varden. 
She looks. &c. 
If I 
could only find her, and know where she is gone, 
I'd write to her by telegraph' not to stay too long; 
But it I 
do not find her, I 
will surely die, 
For I'd get two cents worth of powder and blow my self 
to the sky. 
She looks, &c.

ii.AVE.LLING TINKER. 
Ins two years ago, I'd have you to know, 
I 
got on bad terms with old Clinker, 
And ever since that I've been working for Pat, 
So the boys call me travelling tinker. 
Och, I 
walked up and down the street every day, 
With my furnace and box of tinware, 
If anybody wants to get a 
job done. 
You will always find Jam there. 
CHORUS. 
With me fol de lol fol 101 de dol 101. 
Whack, fol lol de dol ly dough. 
mend boilers and cans, basins and pans, 
And it's all things, like old Clinker; 
You'll always find out that jobs are done good, 
If done by the travelling tinker. 
0 
the way I 
do bawl, and the wimmin do squall, 
Would puzzle all the ould Clinkers; 
Och, it shows very well the people do like 
To dale with a 
travelling tinker. 
With me fol de lol, (tc. 
One day Mrs. Clumsee came running to me: 
Says she: the tin in my kittle's all rotten, 
Troth I 
shud think it was, arrah, madam, says J, 
For it wants a 
new spout and a 
bottom. 
Says she unto me: now what is your price? 
Says I: three cents and one shilling. 
0 
no, says she now you're axing too much, 
To pay that shore I 
am not willing. 
With me fol de tol, & c, 
Och, Mrs. Clumsee, says r, do you see, 
Ancther would ax you a 
quarter ; 
The reason I 
ax you but one and three, 
Is becase I 
am courting your darter. 
Courting my darter, says she unto me, 
You nasty, dirty ould winker, 
I'll give you a 
crack that'll shure break your back, 
If you don't lave me house, 3 
ou ould tinker. 
With ne fol de lol, 
She gave me a 
smack—'twas a 
thundering slap --
Which knock'd me in the arms of ould Clinker, 
Arrah, Paddy, my dear, says he. what brought you here 
It's no place for a 
travelling- tinker. 
I 
quick stood up and looked in his face : 
Says I, how do you do Misthur Clinker? 
Says he, my dear man, be as quick as you can; 
And give up being a 
travelling tinker. 
With me fol de lol, (tc.

THE ROVIN' IRISH BOY. 
Words by W AS. CARLETON. 
Music by C 3 
HMIs. 
(The music of this song is published by Grro SUTRO, 189 West Ball* 
more Street, Bait,, Md. Price 50 cents.) 
I'm a 
rovin' Irish Boy, 
I 
was christened Auckna-cloy 
With a 
turn o' the wrist 
My stick I 
twist, 
I 
am my mother's joy; 
I've thravelled many a 
mile, 
To win a 
coleen's smile 
With a 
love o' my heart, for them I'd pita., - 
And many an hour beguile. 
But now I'm here to tell you all, 
The places I 
have been, 
And all the very funny things 
In my thrayels I 
have seen. 
CHORUS. 
For I'm a 
rovin' Irish By 
I 
was christened Auckna-ahly, 
With a 
turn o' the wrist 
My stick I 
twist, 
And I'm my mother's joy. —Wear.: Giarr:ilren.X 
I've been to " La, Belle France," 
Where the girls know bow to dance 
If I 
left the bogs 
Yet I 
couldn't nit frogs, 
Tho' I've often had a 
chance; 
Don't think that I 
am green, 
For in Germany I've been, 
Where sausages strong, 
And pretzels long, a 
yard or more X've sem& 
Then into Roossia I 
have rushed, 
The land of furs and capes, 
The men all make the women work. 
And the soldiers look like apes. 
For I'm a 
rovin' Irish Boy, 
I 
was christened Auckna-cloy. 
With a 
turn o' my wrist, 
My stick I 
twist, 
And I 
am my mother's joy. 
To China thin I 
Nvint 
And got my hearts contint 
Of the briny say, 
And wretch-ed bad tay 
Enough to make me squint; 
Japan then came in view, 
Be my sowl I 
saw that too. 
But yellow Jack nigh broke my back, 
That's why I 
look so blue. 
Then sailin' lin dher h 
tars and stripes 
I 
reached Columbia's shore. 
And now I 
love the place so well, 
I'll never leave it more. 
Except the cry will be, 
" 
Come Paddy, join with me 
And brave once more. 
The Atlantic's roar, 
And make culd IreTand fres."

PETTICOAT LANE, 
When to Dublin I 
came from the sweet County Down; 
I 
called on a 
friend, for to show me the town; 
He brought me thro' streets, lanes, and alleys so grand, 
Till my brogues were most wore, and I 
scarcely could stand_ 
Lie show'd me fine houses, were built up so high, 
And a 
man made of stone, almost up to the sky; 
But the names of them places went out of my brain, 
Except one, and he said it was, Petticoat Lane. 
Convenient to Petticoat Lane there's a 
place, 
And as we walked through it, we couldn't get peace;, 
The shops were all full of fine -;lothes black and blue, 
But the fellows outside nearly tore me in two: 
One dragged me this way, to get a 
good frieze, 
Another had corduroy breeches, my size: 
But one chap bawls out, when I 
wouldn't remain, 
Show him up to the college in Petticoat Lane 
RI-to, dm 
140, dirc. 
We got lose from this spot, myself and my friend, 
I 
couldn't do less than a 
teaster to spend, 
But we spied boys and girls in a 
laughable group, 
Sitting cross-legged, and they licking up soup. 
Says I, are these what you call your poor-house recruits? 
Ax the divil, says one, and his bowl at me shoots. 
They roared with pleasure, while I 
roared with pain, 
Arrah. Paddy, you're welcome to Petticoat Lane 
gi-to, ea. 
My friend thought to drag me away by the sleeve 
When a 
tartar droot over my head, an old sieve; 
I 
turned for to strike her, but got in the eye 
A 
plaster of what 
called, hot-mutton pie I 
I 
kept groping about, like a 
man that was blind, 
Till I 
caught hould of somebody coming behind: 
I 
prayed that I 
might get the strength of a 
CAIX, 
Te De Asz.z to whale hilla in Petticoat Lane. 
Marto, dui,

PETTICOAT LANE.---LcoNctinnol 
walloped away, and I 
got walloped, too, 
While all sorts of ructions were raised by the crew; 
You would swear it was raining brick-bats and stones. 
Till I 
heard my antagonist giving some groans: 
Run and be daum'd to you! some one did cry, 
Sure, I 
can't t._r the mutton that's stuck in my eye I 
I 
was led through the -crowd, and heard somebody saying, 
There's a 
peeler most kill'd, up in Petticoat Lane. 
Ri to, dm, 
These words like a 
thunderbolt, fell on my ear, 
So, I 
scooped all the fat from my eye, pretty clear; 
My friend tould the crowd that was round, to be mute l 
While we slipped to a 
house, called, the sign of a 
boot; 
There I 
calPd for a 
sup, and we both took a 
seat, 
Two or three that had backed us, came in for a 
treat— 
When the reckoning was called for, my pockets were clean; 
For pounds, shillings, and pence were in Petticoat Lane. 
Ri-to, tbs. 
The reck'ning it came to a 
hog and a 
groat, 
For which the landlord he took the lend of my coat; 
I 
started without, still cursing the town, 
When a 
policeman's pot-stick made friends with my crown. 
Says he: You have killed C. 106.— 
Arrah, be aisy, sir i 
I 
want none of your tricks. 
But the sergeant and twenty more swore it was plain 
That I 
was the bully of Petticoat Lane. 
Ri 
dre. 
They all swarmed about me, like flies on a 
cask; 
Rut to prison to take me was no easy task. 
When I 
got there, I 
was charged with the crime; 
'Twas my own brother Darby I 
bate all the time. 
When he seen me, he ,et out a 
thundering curse 
On the day that he fist went to join in the force; 
Re released my ould coat and no got me off clean 
To go home and say prayers for z-veet Petticoat lAss,

THE POOR HOUSE. 
The times are getting worse and worse, 
libey're going down like a 
sinking purse; 
And if by chance you ask for relief, 
You're knocked about and called a 
thief. 
CHORUS. 
Eat, you paupers, eat, eat, you paupers, eat 
Chop and bite with all your might, 
For you'll get no more till morning; 
Heigh°! here we go, into the Poor House, oh! dear ohl 
Spoken.—Bedad, I 
was forced to go into the Poor House, that's the 
fine building, " outside," but it's awful hungry 
inside," bad luck to 
the architect, every two ends of the year we're brought into a 
big 
yard and we're fed by telegraph, there's half a 
pound of meat stuck 
on the end of the telegraph wire, and there's about five hundred of 
us for that, now then, stand round, the Governor says, oh! we're 
round enough for all we're going to get. 
Heads up—toe the line— aro 
ye's ready; bang— it's gone; did you see it, Murphy! no, no more 
didn't I, nor didn't smell it; and that's all we get from one year's end 
to the — come on, says I, to the rest of the cripples.— come on, and 
we'll make complaints, and up we went, and the governor was sitting 
down to a 
diuner,—none of your common bits of bacon,— but beef! 
beef! be the hok-ey, beef—the smell of it gave me cramps—Mr. Gover-
nor, says I 
to the governor 'that's the first remark I 
made to the 
governor. Well, young man, what's the nature of your complaint! 
Bedad, if you only say'd the word, you'd know it. 
Hunger, that's the 
natu:e of my complaint. 
Oh! say'd he, I 
see you're finding fault with 
the grub of the Union, and as you're the head of these pack of revolu-
tionists, I 
shall pardon them, and punish you. 
I'll send you for two 
hours next door, on the "treadmill," and I 
was forced to go. 
Oh ! the 
" 
tread mill" is what will give you an appetite for your b!eakfast. 
Well, Mr. Governor, I 
don't wish you any harm, but may I 
never die. 
until I 
see yourself and Betty, and all the childer dancing the same 
Jig that I'm dancing now. Hallo. Rooney, is this where you are! 
What are you in for. 
I'm in for nothing. Sarve :you right. The nexti 
time you come here for doing nothing, we'll kick you out. 
You're 
not fit to be in dacent company. What's that other fellow in for? 
Well, he was sick and the doctor told him to take something. What 
did he take I Ho took a 
goold watch! oh! the blaguard. 
Well, Mr. 
Governor, how long have I 
got to go! Two minutes. Ah, bedad, says 
I. I'll have the jail first. 
Well, says he, I'll let you off this time, but 
if you ever commit the same crime, you'll go for seven days. So I 
started off singing— - 
Heigh° ! here we go, out of the Poor House, oh! dear oh I

KILLARNEY. 
By Killarney's lakes and fells, Emerald Isles and winding bays, 
Mountain paths, and woodland dells, mem'ry ever fondly strays, 
Bounteous nature loves all lands, beauty wanders ev'ry where 
Footprints leaves on many strands. but her home is surely there! 
Angels fold their wings, and rest, in that Eden of the West, 
Beauty's home, Killarney, ever fair, Killarney. 
Inisfallen's ruin
E. 'd shrine. may suggest a 
passing sigh. 
But man's faith can ne'er decline. such God's wonders floating by 
Castle Lough and Glenna Bay, mountains Tore and Eagle's Nest, 
Still at Mucross you must pray, though the monks are now at rest. 
Angels wonder not that man there would fain prolong life's span, 
Beauty's home, Killarney, ever fair, Killarney. 
No place else can charm the eye, with such bright and varied tints, 
Every rock that you pass by, verdure broiders or besprints, 
Virgin there the green grows, every morn Spring's natal day, 
Bright-hued berries daff the snows, smiling winter's frown away. 
Angel's often pausing there, doubt if Eden were more fair, 
Beauty's home, Killarney, ever fair Killarney. 
Music there for Echo dwells, makes each sound a 
harmony 
Many-voiced the chorus swells, till it faints in ecstacy, 
With the charmful tints below, seems the heaven above to vie, 
All rich colors that we know, tinge the cloud-wreaths in that sky. 
'Wings of angels so might shine, glancing back soft light divine, 
Beauty's home, Killarney, ever fair Killarney.

TERRENCE O'ROURKE. 
In Dublin famed city one cold frosty night, , 
It's meself, Ted O'Rourke, first saw the daylight ;" 
And when I 
was born, I 
heard my old father say, 
"Biddy, bring the sweet cratur some whiskey and tay." 
SPoKEN.—" Biddy," says me father, " bring the baby some 
whiskey in a 
thy-cup, for by the powers he's the swatest child 
in all Ireland, by the blessing of St. Patrick ; dye see the way 
be sups it?" at the same time she was whisking it down her own 
dirty throat. " Musha! where's the whisky 2" says me father. 
" 
Sure I 
gave it to the baby," said Biddy. " Oh ! that's a 
big 
lie," says I, " father, for divil a 
drop have I 
ttsted." 
While the nurse she was singing and squalling, 
Oh I 
was crying and bawling, 
My father for whiskey was calling, 
At the birth of poor Terrence 0-Rourke. 
At thirteen years ould I 
was sent to a 
school, 
To Father Delancy's at Bally Parule, 
Who says, " Teddy, me boy, if my advice you will follow. 
I'll make you a 
regular out and out scholar." 
SPOKEN—" So he did; for a 
classical academy was that of 
11r. O'Toole's; and here's a 
specimen of one of his best schol-
ars; he did'a lam n 
us all about Jew Peter, Brien Bourn, O'Neil, 
Father Matthew, and all the rest of the gods and the goddesses. 
One morning he called me over to him, says he, " come over 
till I 
give you some advice before , you go to Amerika—in the 
first place, never give anything away that you hav'nt got. 
Secondly, never steal anything you can't carry. 
Thirdly, never 
forget poor ould Ireland, for if you do, you little trollop, 
on 
never can say 1 
was your teacher." 
With that learning I 
had got quite sufficient, 
With the shelalab I 
too was proficient, 
And nothing but cash was deficient, 
To be called Mr. Terrence O'Rourke. 
TERRENCE O'ROURKE. (
CoscLunEn.) 
21 
Now I 
began to grow up to manhood's estate, 
I 
thought it high time to look after a 
mate; 
So I 
fixed upon Nora, from Ballyporceen, 
The swatest young crature that ever was seen. 
SPOKEN.—" Be Got! you may well say that—and the head 
ot her, it was stuck on the middle of her purty little shoulders 
that would put you in mind of a 
bushel of praties tied up in a 
very ugly manner; and then she had two eyes stuck in her dar. 
ling little forhead, that would put you in mind of two rotten 
cockles stuck in the burnt holes of a 
blanket ! and the nose of 
the cratur, it would put you in mind of a 
mountain of misery 
looking down a 
hungry man's throat— and the mouth ! oh I 
the 
mouth! the mouth I % would put you in mind of the big canal 
for transporting praties wholesale, be Got! 
And there was a 
beautiful assembly Caine to our wedding, shure there was all I 
didn't know, and a grate many more too—there was the 
O'Rourkes, the O'Tooles, the Kallagans, the Brallagans, the 
Nolans, the Dolans, the Mullocks, and the Muck Muc-Mullocks, 
and no sooner were we seated down to a beautiful dinner of 
pigs tripe and praties, than up jumps Teddy Moore, ( trailing 
his dirty ould coat,) says he, " Who dare tread on the coat of 
an O'Moore," " Musha I 
who dare talk of an O'Moore in the 
presence of a 
Muck Mulloch, who's name was known before the 
birth of Moses, and descended in regular succession down from 
King Shane to Muck, for double Muc-Muc, Muck Mulloch." 
" 
Oh I 
that only shows the superiority of my family,' says 
011oolygan, " for mine's directed in a 
straight line from Noah's 
Ark." " To blazes wid Noah's Ark, mine would% dirty them-
selves going into Noah's Ark, be jabbers ! they had a 
boat of 
their 011)71. " 
Wid that the row begun; sticks and stones, and 
marrow- bones, up went one and down came hall a 
dozen, ' till 
they all was kilt on the flure ; and just as we going to wake 
them, they jumped up again and began to sing_ 
While the whiskey in tayeups whit round, 
And many lay kilt on the ground; 
And very few weddings were found 
To equal that of poor Terrence O'Rourke.

CRIME. 
As sung with great applause by Gus W ILLIAMS. 
Music published by W HITE & GOULLAUD. Boston, Mass 
I've been thinking of late, I've been thinking, 
My thoughts I 
can scarcely define, 
I've been thinking why people can wonder, 
At this terrible increase of crime; 
Cries, Old Uncle Sam, it's a " poser," 
There's a 
something I 
can't understand, 
I 
would just give a 
trifle to know, sir, 
Why crime should increase in our land. 
I'm sure that we've plenty of gold, sir, 
Our banks are as full as can hold, sir, 
Ilre could buy the whole world I 
am told sir, 
Yet still, there's an increase of crime. 
It's true what you say, Uncle Samuel, 
We've plenty of gold laid away, 
Mouldy with mildew and rust, sir, 
Guarded by night and by day; 
While you, like a 
dog in the manger, 
Your gold to yourself you confine, 
When a 
little would make a 
great change, sir, 
In this terrible increase of crime. 
For expenses you don't care a 
groat, sir, 
Politicians, you feed a 
whole lot, sir, 
While the poor man, with hunger may rot, sir, 
And still you wonder at crime. 
Ill 
C R IME.—
[CONCLuDBA, 
Can you wonder at crime, can you wonder, 
When you see the police on his beat, 
Arresting a 
poor little boot-black 
For earning his bread on the street ; 
While the thief on the corner stands grinning, 
In the broad open light of the day, 
Your pockets he'd pick for a 
shilling, 
And the law cannot touch him they say. 
He smiles with contempt and derision, 
He defies a 
whole police division, 
While that poor boy is cast into prison. 
And still, you wonder at crime. 
Just think while you're drinking your wine, sir, 
How the poor of our land they are fed, 
While you, with your rich folks can dine, sir, 
'Tis a 
god send for. them to get bread ; 
Go visit the home of the poor, sir, 
Such sights you will never behold, 
To our prisons then go and explore, sir, 
And scatter your hoardings of gold. 
A 
little would soon break assunder, 
The chains the poor sufferer is under, 
Go, list to that great voice of hunger, 
And you'll never more wonder at crime.

My name is Barney Brallaghen, I'm a

Oh I

Her father was a

And they gave her a 
good education; 
She could " Parly voo Fransay," and talk it like a

And sing it with a 
deal of animation. 
Oh, my I 
then to hear her play 
The piano, it was worth a

For hours I 
have stood at " In my cottage near a

And " Love among the roses," was a 
caution. 
Oh, my I 
look upon me now, Ace. 
I 
courted her in silence, for " I 
never told my love," 
I 
thought she was so much above my station; 
To gain her hand and heart across the seas I'd rove, 
And try my hand at foreign emigration. 
Olt ! why did I 
leave my love behind ? 
must have been a 
piece of vegetation, 
To leave off digging mould to go and dig for gold, 
And return in a 
state of agitation. 
Oh, my! look upon my agitation, cite.

TERRIBLE TINES. 
As sang by W. F. S. Lawlor in Mr. MicEvor's Original Efibernican. 
‘At, 
za.,r 
Oh thin these are the terrible times, if you're single why so you 
must tarry 
Except a 
few fools that are mad,enough for to venture to marry 
For the bacon ls ninepence a 
pound, and sorra much cheaper 
the meat is, 
And altho' but there's two of them sound, nine and a' half we 
pay for potatoes 
Oh thin these are the terrible times. 
If a 
friendly neighbour drop in, sure he walks with such funeral 
paces 
You'd think he could walk on his head he puts on such awful 
long faces. 
If a 
country friend comes up to town, he's not asked for his 
wife or his babies 
L"ot before he has time to sit down he must tell how he left 
the potatoes. 
Oh thin these are the terrible times. 
The American bacon they say, (though the prices now and then 
vary), 
Every bit of it comes all the way, from that darlin' ould town 
Tipperary; 
If you take a 
walk up the main street, sure its there where the 
wonderful trade is, 
Fine Cumberland cuts there you'll get, and beautiful 
floury 
potatoes, 
Notwithstanding the terrible times. 
And sure when the boys at home riz, sure the ructions were 
terribly awful, 
But the peelers soon showed them that rows, were unpleasant 
as well as unlawful;

TERRIBLE TIMES. [CoNcLum). 
But sure what the row was about, there wasn't one of them 
able to state to us. 
But if "Tenant Right" wasn't the cause 
perhaps t'was about 
the potatoes, 
Or may be the terrible times.

The Reform Bill is now all the go, but ould Ireland's left out of 
the measure, 
There's faults sure, we all of us know, which D' Israeli can see at 
his leisure; 
But if John Bright would again cross the sea, to see what our 
home borough rate is, 
We would treat him to lashons of tea, and beautiful mealy 
potatoes, 
And tell him the terrible times. 
If there was any young lady in here, who would like for to 
change her condition, 
I'm the the boy that could talk in her ear and .whisper my 
little pet ition ; 
I'd tell her I 
came for to woo, and move her by all my entree.

But what else sure its nothing to you, but it wouldn't be about 
the potatoes. 
Nor yet of the terrible times. 
And now that the winter is come, its worse that the times they 
are gettin' 
But as Solomon said to his son, the divil a

I'm told that Holloway's pills, cured a

As blithe as blithe can be, 
For let the times be good or bad, 
They're all the same to me;

For where the dog-star never glows, 
I 
wear away my days.

Down in a 
coal mine, underneath the grourd, 
Where a 
gleam of sunshine never can be found; 
Digging dusky diamonds all the season round, 
Down in a 
coal mine underneath the ground. 
My hands are horny. hard and black 
With working in the vein, 
And like the clothes upon my back, 
My speech is rough and plain ; 
Well, if I 
stumble with my tongue, 
I've one excuse to say, 
'Tis not the collier's heart that's witor.g.

THE COT IN THE CORNER. 
Sung by Wm 
F. SINCLAIR Lawr.on, in the laughable sketch of Barney 
and the Ghost, as performed by CHAS. Alec EVOY'S original 
Hibernicon Troupe. 
Och hone, wirrastrew, how hard is our lot, 
The hrodlord has turned us out of our cot, 
To us in this world ' twas the happiest spot, 
On the hill-side beyant in the corner ; 
The roof was thatched over with bright yellow straw, 
And the walls were as white as the snowflake agra, 
Oh it was a 
fine picture a 
painter might draw, 
From the boreen beyant in the corner. 
It was purty without, it was tidy within, 
On the shelves, shone like silver, our plate made of tin, 
Which cast some reflections when sunlight stole in, 
On the dog and the cat in the corner; 
Of bacon, galore, we had many a 
flitch in 
The wide mouthed chimney, that yawned in the kitchen, 
Oh 'twould make your mouth water, and eager to pitch in 
To the hames that hung high in the corner. 
And there by the fire my mother would knit, 
And close to her side my ould father would sit, 
What stories he'd tell when his dudeen was lit, 
While he smoked away in the corner; 
When supper was over the neighbors dropped in, 
And by the turf fire each roasted his shin, 
While the boys and the girls ne'er thought it a 
Bin 
For to hug and to kiss in the corner. 
When Jirnmj- the piper walked in on the floor, 
The young people all made a 
rush for the door, 
Dragging Jimmy along to the barn, and sure 
They placed him high up in the corner; 
Then at it they went dear with hearts light and gay, 
And danced the night hours into the young day, 
'Till Jimmy got drunk an' no longer could play, 
For he lay pipes and all in the- corner.

The bird on the tree is singing his song, 
So sweetly to me the whole Wiling long; 
How happy and gay, how joyous and free, 
He is with his song, sweet bird on the tree. 
The daylight is fleeting, the moon shines above,

The bird on the tree, dear, is singing his song. 
The bird on tree is singing his song? 
Yes, he calls, yes, he calls, 
He is calling for thee, 
He is calling for thee, 
Is the bird, is the bird on the tree. 
The bird on the tree sings carols so clear, 
His song full of glee now falls on mine ear; 
Then haste to me, pray, I 
am waiting for thee, 
And fain would be gay like the bird on the tree, 
The blossoms are sleeping, the wind softly sighs, 
The fair stars are peeping above in the skies, 
To guide thee to me, dear, the woodlands along, 
The bird on the tree, dear, is singing, is singing his song.

THE STYLE IN WHICH IT'S DONE. 
As Sung by BILLY Corrom. 
I 
stand before you once again, 
A few words just to say; 
The subject of my song I'm sure, 
We each meet every day. 
Some men live fast and others slow, 
As through the world we run ; 
But so very much depends upon 
The style in which it's done. 
A man shall steal a 
horse, we read, 
And not be " brought to took; 
While another man across a 
hedge 
Is not allowed to look. 
This may seem contradictory, 
Indeed, to many a 
one; 
But so very much depends upon 
The style in which it's done. 
The politician speechifies, 
And makes a 
great hurrah, 
Till another man. he mounts the stand, 
And points out every flaw. 
He gets the nomination, 
And for Congress he does run ; 
Succeeds and laughs to think he knows 
The style in which it's done. 
Now has it ne'er occurred to you, 
How strange the mystery seems; 
That girls can dash along Broadway, 
Who scarce are in their teens ? 
Their pas are poor, but still they dress. 
In a 
style that's number one, 
But I 
suppose it all depends upon 
The style in which it's done. 
I 
think I'll conclude my song. 
Perhaps you'll say ; 
it's time," 
But I 
hope that I 
have pleased you 
With my little bit of rhyme. 
Some may think it is too short 
And others it's too long : 
But very much depends upon 
The style in which it's done.

Can grease the wheels of my jaunting car.

And a

A

To carry me over the seas; 
To carry we over the seas, my boys,

thousand miles away. 
My true love she is beautiful, 
My true love she is young; 
Her eyes are blue as the violet's hue 
And silvery sounds her tongue; 
And silvery sounds her tongue, my eoys,

She is doing the grand in the distant land, 
Ten thousand wiles away. [So blow, ftc.

When last she left the strand, 
She bid good bye with a

And waved her lilly hand; 
She waved her lilly hand, my boys, 
As the big ship left the bay, 
And says she, remember me, 
Ten thousand miles away. [So blow, etc. 
Oh ! if I

And straight to my true love steer, my boys,

You'll not find anywhere, 
Such dashing swells and handsome girls

Union Square, Union Square, 
You'll not find anywhere, 
Such dashing swells and handsome girls 
As you will meet with there. 
Ali, when the season's in full swing, 
Now that's the time for me— 
Such howling swells and dashing bells 
You every night will see. 
Fond Mas, and Pas, so anxious, 
In glory they come out. 
And lay such traps for us poor chaps, 
At a 
party, ball or rout.

Wander where you will, my boys, 
No matter where you train 
You'll never see I'm certain, 
Another Harlem Lane, 
For where can you see such beauty, 
As you will meet with there. 
On a

Amongst the fairest of the fair. 
Union Square, 8Le. 
So now, dear boys, I 
must be off, 
I've something on to- night, 
There's Mrs Miller's party— 
And her I 
cannot slight, 
She's guardian to a

Who has some thou—s

And to cut a

To live near Union Square.

THE BOYS OF NEW YORK. 
As Finn g by BILLY corroN. 
Say, Jack, I've been bothered some lately, 
By the poems that comes from the West, 
About Ifeathern Chinees playing poker, 
With Bill Nye and all of the rest. 
But why don't they write of our city, 
About us and our big diamond pins, 
Where we always play keno and faro, 
And commit other such innocent sins. 
This is the town for big buffers, 
Where the elephant can always be seen, 
And pocketbook-droppers are waiting, 
To play tricks upon those who are green. 
If those fellows would like to play poker, 
Let them come here—we'll rope them in, 
And we'll fight them with pops or with bowies, 
For we are the lads for the skin. 
These fellows are great on their lingo, 
As their poets have given a 
proof, 
But we are the boys for a 
skirmish, 
And can put on a 
fine Mansard roof. 
Those fellows know nothing 'bout voting— 
I'll bet that they cannot repeat, 
If we should depend on such duffers, 
Our Mall would always be beat. 
This smartness may do on the prairie, 
And snoozers may there have a 
fling, 
But if they would visit our city, 
We would teach them to work the old thing. 
I 
met Molly in the garden, 
I 
believe 'twas after tea, 
She had on her Dolly Varden, 
She completely dazzled me; 
Oh, tell me, darling, that you love me, 
She gave my little hand a 
squoze. 
Take my greenbacks, Molly darling, 
Don't turn up to me your nose. 
Molly, fattest-, 
fairest, hugest, 
Look up, darling, tell me that 
You still love me, Molly darling, 
Don't despise me 'cause I'm fat. 
When T% ere married, Molly darling, 
And you are my loving spouse, 
We'll have lots of Dolly Vardens. 
Playing tag around the house ; 
You must give them paregoric, 
Put them in their little bed, 
Should they annoy you, Molly darling, 
Gently put on them a 
head. 
Molly, fattest, ttc. 
NORAH. DALLY. 
I'm waiter at the " Cock and Cow," 
A decent situation ; 
And if you will but listen now, 
I'll sing a 
sad narration. 
I 
once was lively — full of mirth, 
But now I'm serious really ; 
I 
curse the hour that gave me birth, 
And all through Norah 
Oen, see my Norah in her best, 
Each Sunday as she goes out; 
No sergeant- major, when full dress'd, 
Can turn such lovely toes out. 
Yet some are forced to pad and stuff, 
To make them look genteelly ; 
Of solid flesh she's quite enough, 
So neat is Noralt Daily. 
Like pickled walnuts are her eyes, 
Her nose it is a 
thumper; 
Her cheeks like dumplings are in size, 
They both so fat and plump are ; 
Her shoulders five feet broad at laist, 
Complexion rather paley ; 
No man nor beast can span her waist, 
And such is Norah Dally. 
I 
thought her virgin soul to hit, 
By sweet and tinder speeches ; 
So fould her that her charms had bit 
My heart as hard as leeches. 
With that she gave me such a 
look, 
As made m_e stagger really; 
Then in my blushing face she shook, 
The fist of Norah Daily. 
In voice of thunder then, says she, 
Yourself, young man, too small is; 
An eight foot ,grenadier for me, 
Not an inch too tall is. 
So go your way, you tiny thing, 
And don't act ungenteelly ; 
For ne'er before the priest ye'll bring, 
The likes of Norah 
Oeh I 
then I 
swore a 
bible oath, 
That I 
woe], ne'er be ceasing; 
Until f 
had improved my growth, 
By every limb increasing. 
I 
fed on praties, roast and boiled, 
Both waxey ones and meally— 
To stretch myself I 
work'd and toird, 
And all for Norah Daily. 
But all my toilings were in vain, 
I 
didn't grow a 
jot, sure ; 
And if L 
hadn't stopp'd ' tis plain, 
Myself had gone to pot, sure. 
I 
on my Venus once more called, 
When dress'd up spruce and gaily ; 
Then on my marrow bones I 
failed, 
In front of .!Torah Daily. 
She stared at me wid both her eyes, 
Her finger on her nose put; 
Said, since I'd not increased in size, 
Her love for me was lock'd up. 
These words upon my heart came whack! 
I 
scarce knew what could ail me ; 
She grimed a 
grin, then show'd her back, 
And away marched Norah

Oh, let's not forget that we live in glass houses, 
Nor throw any stones at our neighbors and friends; 
A word fitly spoken to duty arouses, 
While harshness of language too often offends. 
Perhaps you've a 
friend who on chiding will trample, 
Be ready, I say, with kind words to entice; 
But when you give counsel, be prompt with example,

The ladder of life may be irksome and weary, 
And oft the poor traveler may droop on his way; 
Why cannot we seek, then, to make it less dreary, 
By lighting his pathway with hope's kindling ray? 
Oh, each may do something, and show he is human, 
May help drowning man ere he sink 'neath life's wave; 
May stretch forth his hand to protect helpless woman, 
And say, I

I'm here, I'm here to restore and to save.—Ono.

I'm all the way from Paddy's Land, 
Out upon the spree. 
I 
thought I'd like to have a 
trip, 
So I 
landed myself on board a 
ship ; 
The sixteenth of March I 
sail'd away, 
And got here on St. Patrick's day. 
So now what, &e. 
For love and whisky I 
would die, 
And the ladies hearts I 
can't deny, 
It's because I 
like the blarney stone, 
That the darlints won't leave me alone. 
So now what, &c. 
The other day while in the street, 
A pretty girl I 
chanced to meet, 
I've heard it talked about, says she. 
That you're the rollicking Pat Magee. 
So now what, &c 
I 
very soon loved her as my life, 
And in less than a 
week she was my wife, 
For the joys of love are wide awake, 
And Pm not so fond of the single state. 
So now what, & c. 
To Ireland now we're going away, 
So I 
must wish you all good day, 
For married life is full of joy, 
And it's well enjoyed by this Irish boy. 
So now what, &c. 
l'AoArka, 
THE ISLE OF FRANCE. 
The sun was far in the clouds advanced, 
When a 
convict came to the Isle of France, 
Around his leg he wore a 
ring and chain, 
And his ccuntry was of the shamrock green, 
The coast-guard waited on the beach, 
Till the convict's boat was within reach, 
The convict's chains did so shine and spark, 
Which open'd the veins of the coast-guard's heart. 
Then the coast-guard lanch'd his little boat 
That on the ocean with him to float. 
The birds at night take their silent rest, 
But the convict here has a 
wounded breast. 
Then the coast-guard came to the Isle of France, 
Towards him the convict did advance, 
When the tears from his eyes did fall like rain, 
Young man, I 
hear you are of the shamrock green. 
I 
am a 
shamrock, the convict cried, 
That has been toss.d 
on the ocean wide, 
For being unruly, I 
do declare, 
And was doom'd a 
transport for seven years• 
When six of them was past and gone 
We were coming home to make up one, 
When the stormy winds did blow and roar, 
Which cast me here on a 
foreign shore. 
Thu n 
the coast-guard played noble part, 
had with some brandy cheered the convict's heart: 
Although the night is so far advanced, 
You shall find a 
friend in the Isle of France. 
Then a 
speedy letter went to the Queen, 
About the dreadful shipwreck of tie shamrock green; 
Then his freedom came by a 
speedy post, 
To the absent convict they thought was lost. 
God bless the coast-guard, the convict cried, 
You have saved my life from the ocean wide; 
I 
will drink his health in a 
flowing glass. 
Here's success to the Isle of France.

WONDERFUL STICK.

PADDY 0 
BRIAN. 
One Paddy O'Brian left Ireland with glee, 
For he long had a 
notion old England to see, 
So be jumped on a 
ship which for England was bound. 
And the whisky he drank made his heart doubly sound. 
Pat had ne'er been on the ocean before ; 
With fear he did quake when he heard the whales roar, 
He began for to sicken, and the whisky he spilt, 
Och ! murther, says Paddy, Oh faith I'll be kilt. 
Pat often had heard of these wonderful tales, 
Of ships being to.sed by mighty big whales, 
Oh said he, blood and 'ouns, and about he did skip, 
When be beard the CTOW shout there was a 
whale at the ship. 
Paddy gave a 
lep, and be clung to the mast, 
His arms he clipped round it, and there he stuck fast, 
When the ship gave a 
heave, and loosened his grip. 
And down the whale's throat poor Paddy did slip. 
When Pat got inside of the whale he did shout, 
And looked for a 
door, or seine place to get out, 
Oh! said he, sure enough, I've got in some row, 
I 
was in a 
ship, but oh! where am I 
now 
Said Paddy, I 
set sail for old England it's clear, 
But I 
can't tell the reason, or how I 
came here, 
What part of the ship I 
am in, faith I 
don't know, 
Oh ! then I 
think I 
must be in the cabin below. 
Said Pat, I 
can't see either Christian or beast, 
All I 
am wishing to know is to just meet the priest ; 
Sme this is no place all alone for to lie in, 
Oh be gob, it's a 
game that the fairies are trying. 
A month and five days in the whale he hid stop. 
When luckily in the whale's throat be then popped, 
Oh! said be, let me out or your bowels I 
will screw, 
When the whale gave a 
cough, which on land Paddy threw. 
Now Paddy's got safe on his own native shore, 
And he says he'll ne'er sail in a 
ship any more. 
For the next time be wishes old England to see, 
It will be when the railway comes over the sea. 
How are you, my sons of Columbia ? 
Just list to a 
bold Irish boy; 
That loved both the cats and their kittens, 
The pigs and their litters with joy. 
My mother I 
loved like the sunshine, 
All the girls, faith, I 
tried for to charm; 
In my mouth I 
don't carry much music, 
But I 
have it all under my arm. 
CHORUS. 
So list to an Irishman's ditty, 
For Paddy's the boy to outshine; 
And if it don't please you ' tis a 
pity, 
With this wonderful big stick of mine. 
Now my mother said it would be a 
riddle, 
If I 
could not blow the big drum ; 
But my father said it would be the fiddle, 
lie could tell by my finger and thumb. 
But my grandad said, " Now to convince ye, 
And prove how I 
can shove him thro' life, 
I 
know where his talents all rest "— 
SO 
he gave me this wonderful pipe. 
So list to an Irishman's ditty, &c. 
At the door we heard a 
loud knocking, 
'Twas caused by my music so grand ; 
And around me the neighbors all flocking, 
Each one of them collared my hand, 
Saying, " Teddy, sure, is that you, boy, 
That such illigant music contrives ; 
It's yourself that we want, darling, honey, 
To keep all us poor divels alive." 
So list to an Irishman's ditty, &c.

BE A GOOD BOY AND TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF. 
When I 
was at home, with my father and mother, 
I 
bate the old couple, and Teddy my brother_ 
At learning, I 
mane; for I 
handled the spade, 
And so !lately I 
followed the turfeutting trade; 
But old Father Murphy, our parish director, 
lie now and then gave me a 
bit of a 
lecture; 
" 
Arrah, Barney," says he, " you're a 
frolicsome elf, 
But be a 
good boy, and take care of yourself!" 
With your too ral lal loo, &c. 
My Judy I 
lov'd and oft gave her a 
kiss; 
" 
Fie, Barney," says she, but ne'er took it amiss: 
One night I 
took leave; says I " Judy, I'm off," 
But heard, as I 
thought, in the closet, a 
cough ; 
So I 
opened the door, and I 
stared like a 
pig, 
There stood old Father Murphy, without hat or wig; 
" 
Arrah, Father," says I, " you're a 
frolicsome elf, 
But be a 
good boy and take care of youself!" 
With your too ral lal loo, &c. 
I 
was a 
going, when old Father Murphy cried, " Stay, 
We'll settle this matter, I'll tell you the way, 
I'll marry you both, and then, Barney, you know—" 
"Thank'ee, father," says I, " but I'd much rather go." 
So to old Father Murphy I 
bade a 
good night, 
And to Judy I 
said—what you'll own was quite right— 
" 
Arrah, Judy," says I, " you're a 
frolicsome elf, 
But I'll be a 
good boy, and take care of myself!" 
With my too ral lal loo, & c. 
PARODY ON LIMERICK RACES. 
I'm a 
roving Irish boy, I've seen some ups and downs, sirs, 
So I've come to try my luck in famous London town, sirs, 
They say that I 
was born in darling Tipperary, 
Where I 
charmed the ladies all by the twist of my shillelah. 
'Twas on St. Patrick's day, I 
left sweet Judy Connor, 
God bless her two black eyes, sure don't I 
doat upon her! 
For she's a 
charming girl, in crinoline so frisky, 
And can't she do a 
jig, when she gets blind druqk on 
whisky. 
Ocb, to wish them all good bye, God knows it was a 
bother, 
My Judy piped her eyes, and so did my old mother. 
'rho pig began to squall, and my feelings I 
could not 
smother 
And the dog began to howl, and so did my big brother. 
So then a 
row begun, they all got drunk together, 
With sticks and stones you know, walloping one another. 
They swore I 
should not come to leave sweet Tipperary, 
So I 
floored them one by one with my beautiful shillelah. 
So here I 
am, my boys, to tip you all some blarney, 
I 
am my mother's son, and they call me wicked Barney. 
But if you want to fight, beware of my shillelah, 
For I'm coming some other night with my splinter of 
shillelah.

JUDY CARY. 
I 
came from Tipperary in search of Judy Cary, 
Where the boys are so merry, 
And the girls they are so free. 
She ,aid she loved me dearly, 
Truly and sincerely, 
But one fine purty Summer's day 
She went away from me. 
CHORUS. 
Judy Cary, Judy Cary, 
How could you prove so contrairy, 
Judy Cary, Judy Cary, 
How could you treat your Barney so 
By the bogs in Tipperary, 
There lived Judy Cary; 
Although her income it was small 
Yet she was quite gra, 
She'd a 
father and a 
mother, 
And a 
mighty great big brother, 
I 
never thought till now, boys, 
That from me she'd run away. 
Judy Cary, dm 
Oh ! tell me, have you seen her ? 
You couldn't see a 
neater, 
She wears a 
red hood on her head 
And slipper., on her feet. 
She was always light and airy, 
And could dance like any fairy, 
She's a 
beauty altoget er, boys, 
I 
wish I 
now could see her. 
Judy Cary, &c. 
I've been up all the mountains, 
Near all the lakes and fountains, 
Looked into wells and water-butts, 
But her I 
cannot find. 
So as 
in a 
plight, boys, 
bid you all good night, boys; 
For the loss of my sweet colleen. 
I 
will die of grief I'm sure.

'ROM MUNSTER I 
CAME. 
Ant :—" Patrick's day in the morning," 
From Munster I 
came, and I 
went into Leinster, 
I 
met with a 
dame and they called her a 
spinster, 
I 
sat down on a 
stool in the corner fornenced her, 
On Patrick's day in the morning. 
Says I, my dear jewel, I'm the boy that has plenty 
Of praties and cabbage, and all other dainties, 
I'm comely and cane, and just turned one and twenty, 
I've bullocks and cows, and things worth your attention, 
I've great things, and small things, and things I 
won't 
mention, 
Arrah, my darlant, I'll treat you with all condescension, 
On Patrick's day in the morning. 
Ah, aheagar, says she, though I'm not in a 
hurry, 
If along with yourself a 
short time I 
would tarry, 
Then what d'ye think if myself you would marry, 
On Patrick's day in the morning. 
For I've two hundred guineas, a 
two year old heifer, 
A pig and a 
goat, that's both comely and clever; 
On a 
Sunday I 
ride with my new coat and beaver— 
Arrah, boy, will you have me, but will you remember, 
To use me genteel, for you know I'm but tender ? 
She was three score and ten long after November, 
On Patrick's day in the morning. 
Now she had but one ..00th and that same was quite rotten. 
We struck up the match, and to church we went trotting, 
Sure we vowed and we swore things that shan't be for-
gotten, 
On Patrick's day in the morning. 
But just coming home, as you know it's our nature, 
1Ve went into a 
shebeen house to get a 
drop of the crea-
ture, 
My wife then she swigged it, bad luck to the neater; 
But you see on the road home we met with a 
river, 
I 
forgot my politeness and jumped it quite clever, 
My wife tumbled in, and I 
lost her for ever, 
On Patrick's day in the morning.

ALLY CROAKER. 
There lived a 
man in Ballinacrazy, 
Who wanted a 
wife to make him uneasy; 
Long had he sigh'd for dear Ally Croaker, 
And thus the gentle youth he did bespoke her, 
Will you marry me, dear Ally Croaker ? 
This artless young man just come from the schoolery, 
A novice in love and all its foolery; 
Too dull for a 
wit, too grave for a 
joker, 
And thus the gentle youth he did bespoke her, 
Will you marry me, dear Ally Croaker ? 
He drank with her father, he talk'd with the mother, 
He romp'd with the sister, he gam'd with the brother ; 
And gam'd till he pawn'd his coat to the broker 
Which lost him the heart of his dear Ally Croaker, 
Oh the fickle heart of his dear Ally Croaker. 
To all you young men who are fond of gaming 
And losing your money, while others are saving. 
Fortune's a 
jilt, the devil may choke her, 
A 
jilt more inconstant that dear Ally Croaker, 
Oh the inconstant and dear Ally Croaker. 
JUDY, YOU BLACKGUARD 
Och Judy, you blackguard, I 
see you've been lushing, 
I 
know by the leer of your eye ; 
In each whisky shop your nose you've been pushing, 
And taking a 
drop on the sly. 
Bad luck to your dram-drinking throttle, 
Och I 
fad now I'm murthered complately, 
In troth, you're the queen of the bottle, 
And your rags like a 
gibbet fly neatly. 
CII01t,US. 
Och ! yes they do, oh . you devil, they do, 
And your rags like a 
gibbet fly neatly. 
There once was a 
time when I 
thought you were purty, 
But now you're ugly as sin ; 
Your carbuncle nose for ever is dirty, 
And the colour of snuff is your skin, 
Sure the devil your equal ne'er found, 
In the whole of his internal creation, 
And when you go to him, I'll be bound, 
°eh! he'll blush for his ugly relation. 
Och! yes be will, & c. 
When first we were married, love, you was my darling, 
how happy each moment passed by ; 
But now night and day we're like cat and dog snarling, 
When you've got a 
sup in your eye. 
And when to your uncle's you go, 
The tales that you tell there are shocking, 
You put on such it face full of woe, 
And for gin you would pop your ould stocking. 
Och I 
yes you would, SLe. 
There's myshirt, whene'er it wants washing 
You hang it out on a 
nail in the wall, 
While suds you are at it dashing, 
For fear you should scrub out. the tail. 
Like a 
Hottentot king I 
am decked out, 
in all colours and patches and stitches ; 
My new clothes you've shov'd up the spout, 
And swallow'd coat, waistcoat, and breeches, 
Och ! yes you have, &c.

THE COW EAT THE PIPER. 
In the year 'OS when our troubles were great, 
And it was treason to be a 
Milesian, 
Those black-whisker'd set we will never forget 
Tho' history tells us they were Hessians. 
ln this troublesome time, oh, ' twas a 
great crime, 
And murder never was riper, 
At the side of Glensbee, not an acre from me, 
There lived one Denny Byrne a 
piper. 
Neither wedding or wake would be worth a 
shake, 
That Denny was not first invited, 
At squeezing the bags and emptying the kegs 
lie astonished as well as delighted. 
In these times poor Denny could not earn one pen•QT, 
Martial law had him stung like a 
viper, 
They kept him within tiil the bones and his skin, 
Were grinning thro' the rags of the piper. 
One evening in June as he was going home. 
After the fair of Ilathnagan, 
What should he see from the branch of a 
tree, 
But the corpse of a 
hessian there hanging. 
Says Denny these rogues, have boots, I've brogues, 
On the boots then he laid such a 
griper, 
lie pulled with such might and the boots were so tight 
That the legs and the boots came away with the 
Piper. 
Then Denny did run, for fear of' being hung, 
Till he came to Tim Kennedy's cabin, 
Says Tim from within, I 
can't let you in, 
You'll be shot if you're caught there a 
rapping. 
lie went to the shed, where the cow was in bed, 
With a 
wisp he began for to wipe her, 
They lay down together, on a 
seven foot feather 
And the cow fell a 
hugging the piper. 
[
1] 
THE COW, &C.—[CONCLUDED. 
Then Denny did yawn, as the day it did dawn, 
And he streed off the boots of the Hessian, 
The legs by the law, he left them on the straw 
And he gave them leg bail for his mission, 
When the breakfast was done, Tim sent out his son, 
To make Denny jump up like a 
lamp- lighter, 
When the legs there he saw, he roared like a 
jackdaw, 
Oh, daddy, the cow's cat the piper. 
Musha bad luck an' the beast, she'd a 
musical taste, 
For to eat such a 
beautiful chanter, 
Arrah Patrick avic, take a 
lump of a 
stick 
Drive her off to Glenheally—we'll cant her. 
Mrs. Kennedy bawl'd, and the neighbors were called, 
They began for to humbug and jibe her, 
To the churchyard Tim walked, with the legs in a 
box, 
And the cow will be hung for the piper. 
The cow she was drove a 
mile or two off, 
To the fair at the side of Glenhettly, 
And there she was sold for four guineas in gold, 
To the clerk Unite parish, Tim Daley. 
They went to a 
tent the lucky penny was spent, 
The clerk being a 
jolly old swiper, [date," 
Who the blazes was there playing the " Rakes of 
But poor Denny Byrne the piper. 
Then Tim gave a 
bolt, like a 
halt-drunken colt, 
At the piper hegazed like a 
gommack, 
He said, by the powers, I 
thought these eight hours, 
You were playing in Drinan Dim's stomach. 
Then Denny observed, how the hessian was served, 
And they all wisael nicks secure to the griper, 
For grandeur they met, their whistles they wet, 
And like devils they danced round the piper.

of Nutn- ber 
I 
am not a 
selfish miser, taking care of Number one; 
No, the money I 
spend freely, which by honest work I've won. 
This must be your leading maxim if a 
witinin,g race you'd run: 
Live a 
life of moderation, and take care of Number one. 
Take care of Number one, &c. 
Number one may freely mingle with the joyous scenes of life, 
happy days are not too frequent, pleasure is not always rife; 
So, when merry folks assemble, do not fear to join the fun, 
Drink, but drink in moderation, and take care of Number one. 
Take care of Number one, dm. 
Nualber one will sometimes grumble, think that he's an ill-used elf, 
Vow that all the world's against him, none so wretched as himself 
Then will Number one, for comfort, oft-times to the bottle run, 
Better seek a 
loving woman, she'll take care of Number one. 
Take care of Number one, &c. 
I've a 
wife that I 
love dearly, children sporting round my knee; 
Merry little laughing urchins, filling all my house with glee. 
So I'm happy; if you doubt it, and my way you ehane to come, 
If you want a 
hearty welcomed just look in at Number one. 
Take care of Number one, 
Look after Number one; 
Merrily thro' life you'll run, 
Taking care of Number one.

THE DONNYBROOK JIG. 
Oh, 'twas Dermot O'Nolan M'Figg, 
That could properly handle a 
twig; 
He went to the fair, 
And kicked up a 
dust there, 
In dancing the Donnybrook Jig, 
With his sprig. 
Oh, my blessing to Dermot M'Figg. 
When he came to the midst of the fair, 
lie was all in a 
paugh of fresh air, 
For the fair very soon, 
Was as full as the moon, 
Such mobs upon mobs as were there, 
So more luck to Donnybrook Fair! 
The souls they came pouring in fast, 
To dance while the leather would last, 
For the Thomas-street brogue, 
Was then in much vogue, 
And oft with a 
brogue a 
joke pass'd 
Quite fast, 
While the cash and the whisky did last. 
But Dermot, his mind on love bent, 
hi search of his sweetheart went, 
Peeped in here and there, 
And he walked through the fair, 
And took a 
small drop in each tent, 
As he went, 
Och ; on whisky and love he was bent. 
And who should he spy in a 
jig? 
With a 
mealman so tall and so big, 
13ut his own darling Kate, 
So gay and so nate— 
Faith, her partner he hit him a 
dig, 
But he beat the meal out of his wig. 
Then Dermot with conquest elate. 
Drew a 
stool near his beautiful Kate; 
Arrah, Katty, says he, 
My own Cushla niachree 
Sure the world for beauty you bate, 
Complate, 
So we'll just take a 
dance while we wait.

Oh rare,

THE DONNY 
BROOK JIG.—[CONCLuDED. 
The piper, to keep him in tune,

Until an arch wag, 
Cut a 
hole in his bag, 
And at once put an end to the tune [Too soon, 
Och, the music flew up to the moon. 
To the fiddler, says Dermot M'Figg, 
Will you please to play " Skelah na gig," 
We'll shake a 
loose toe, 
While you humor the bow, 
To be sure you won't wear the wig [01 M'Figg, 
While he dances a 
tight Irish jig. 
But says Katty, the darlint, says she, 
If you'll only just listen to me, 
It's meself that will show 
That he can't be your foe, 
Though he fought for his cousin, that's me, 
Says she, 
For, sure, Billy's related to me. 
For my cousin-jarmin, Annie Wild, 
Stood for Biddy Mulrooney's first child. 
And Biddy's step-son, 
Sure he married Bess Dunn, 
Who was gossip to Jenny, as mild, [A child, 
As ever at mother's breast smiled. 
And maybe you don't know Jane Brown, 
Who served goats' whey in sweet Dundrum town, 
'Twas her uncle's half brother, 
That married my mother. 
And bought me this new yellow gown, 
To go down, 
When the marriage was held at Milltown. 
By the powers! then says Dermot, ' tis plain, 
Like the son of that rapscallion Cain, 
My best friend I've kilt, 
Though no blood there is spilt, 
And the ill vii a 
harm did I 
mane, [ That's plain, 
But by me he'll never be kilt again. 
Then the mealman forgave him the blow, 
That laid him a 
sprawling so low, 
And being quite gay, 
Asked them both to the play, 
But Katty, being bashful, said no, 
No, no, 
So he treated them all to the show.

MARHYATT'S NOVELS. 
De Wilt's Uniform and Cheap Edition. 
" 
Harry Bluffs" and " Tom Bowlines " are now only to be found in all 
their native colors portrayed in the pages of Marryatt. 
This edition is from 
the latest revised copy, and is the cheapest in the world. 
PRICE TWENTY-FIVE CENTS EACH. 
NEWTON FOSTER.—One pe-
rusal of this will give a 
clearer idea 
of a 
seaman's existence than a 
voy-
age around the Horn. 
MI DSHI PMAN E AS V.—This 
writer never wrote a 
dull book, and 
this one is the least of all open to 
that fault. 
PETER SUM PLE.— 
This is one 
of the best sea stories in any lan-
guage. 
Thousands have laughed 
at the locker full of fun that the 
Captain opens for all. 
VACUA or RIANY TALES. 
The many tales will be found equal 
to one another, and all excellent, 
and never tedious in length. 
THE Pi-RATE AND THE 
THREE cul"r Ens. 
— 
Frowning men, clambering aboard 
contested craft: shots exchanged; 
cutlasses clashing—in short, fierce 
encounters fill these thrilling pages. 
TIlE KING'S OWN. — Unal-
loyed enjoyment—the sea-breeze, 
the exciting espisodes, the novel 
scenes and persons, without the 
discomforts attending them. 
JAMIE"' IN SEARCH OF 
A FA'i HE 
Ift. — There has risen 
not one worthy to wield Marryatt's 
pen. 
No reader regrets starting 
out with Japhet in his long search. 
SNARL 
EYOW, THE DOG 
FIEND.— If laughing makes peo-
ple increase in bulk,'" Snarleyow " 
would have been found guilty of 
making DaniA Lamberts of the 
human race. 
JACOB FAITHFUL. — There 
has rarely been a 
man placed in a 
position so fitted for seeing the sail-
or's life as Captain Marryatt, and 
never one so able in portraying it. 
FRANK 
EDM.4,17. — Per-
haps in no other work does Marry-
att better evince his talent than he 
does in " Frank Mildmay." None 
can beat the " Cap." 
PERCIVAL KEENE. — A 
thorough knowledge of every wish, 
hope, and fear of a 
sailor, makes 
Marryatt the best nautical novelist 
that ever lived. 
PHANTOM SHIP. — Now, if 
anybody knows more about " Wiz-
ard Skiffs" and " Flying Dutch-
men" than Marryatt, he can take 
our tarpaulin. 
ItATLIN, THE REEFER._ 
The happiest days of our existence 
were when we were " laying off " 
in the foretop of old 
Ironsides," 
reading this charming book to our 
all-delighted messmates. 
THE POACHER. — Marryaft 
proves that he could write as well 
of " shore" life. 
The adventures 
of Joseph Rushbrook are at once 
very extraordinary and very affect-
ing. 
POOR JACK.--The history of 
this little sea- side waif is one of the 
most genuine narratives of a 
sailor-
boy's cruise that has ever been en-
tered in the log-book of life.

word added, not a 
word omitted. But

cheapness
