THE FAMILY NEXT DOOR. 
Written and composed by JOHN SHEEHAN. 
Sung by SqEEHAN 
Co r 
YE with great success. 
Copyrighted, 1881, by A. J. FISHER. 
I 
am a 
quiet, sober man, 
My name is Johnnie McGee, 
I 
work all day and pay my way, 
But one thing troubles me: 
I'm getting thin for want of sleep, 
My head with pain is sore, 
And the cause of all my trouble 
Is the family next door. 
CHORUS: 
They'll drink and smoke, and laugh and joke, 
Like Cannibals they do roar; 
I 
am kept awake the whole night long 
By the family next door. 
They beat their children every day, 
They have them black and blue; 
And when the landlord comes for rent. 
Lord knows they beat him, too. 
They'll turn his pockets inside out 
-As he lays upon the floor, 
There the toughest nuts in all the town, 
Is the family next door.

HE'S ONLY A 
WORKINGMAN. 
Written by JOHN SHEEHAN of SHEEHAN 8: COYNE. 
with great success. 
Behold in me a 
laboring man, 
I'm a 
hardy son of toil, 
I'm not one of the fancy kind, 
Afraid their hands to soil; 
I'm an advocate of labor's rights, 
Though humble in my way; 
And I'll agitate the workman's cause, 
Until we gain the day. 
Chorus.—For no friends has he to help him on, 
Through life's uncertain span, 
They pass him by, they'd let him die, 
For he's only a 
workingman. 
These men of wealth they never think 
Of us who made them great, 
They drink their wine and laugh at us, 
The men who built the State; 
They make us work like slaves all day, 
For the pittance small they give; 
May God forgive them for their crime, 
They barely let us live. 
They talk about their churches 
And their palaces so grand, 
They all forget that they were built 
By labor's honest hand; 
They frown at us and pass us by, 
They never seem to know 
That a 
workingman's as good as they, 
Wherever he may go. 
Now when they treat us in this way, 
God knows we're not to blame, 
But still, when we retaliate, 
They cry at us for shame; 
They call us thieves and vagabonds, 
But well enough they know, 
If the workingman but had his rights, 
Few thieves we'd have to show. 
Sung by them.

Words and Music by M. J. COYNE. As sung by SHEEHAN AND COYNE. 
—: 
0 :— 
Good evening to you one and all, 
You're looking well we see, 
But if you listen unto us, 
Our troubles we'll tell to thee; 
We lately have come over 
From a 
land that's far away, 
But we are going back again, 
We can no longer stay. 
CTIORIIS: 
We're going back again, going back again 
To the emerald Isle across the sea; 
Going back again, going back again 
To a 
royal family. 
Now when we landed here below. 
Our hearts were light and free; 
But when we met our dear old friends, 
Whom we thought we never would see, 
They brought us to their welcome home, 
Where we spent many a 
day; 
But we got a 
message from our folks, 
And so we're going away.

CON DONAHUE. 
Air—My Mary Ann. 
Words by M. J. 
COYNE. 
As sung by SHEEFIAN 6: COYNE. 
Oh, give me your attention and to you I'll mention— 
I'll tell you the trouble that happened to me: 
I've been disrespected, my character molested 
By a 
gang on the corner whenever I 
see. 
Oh, they say that my breeches needs a 
couple of stitches 
They say I 
look well and my walk it is neat, 
They say will he tumble, he ought not to grumble 
For he tackles the free lunch of tripe and pigs' feet. 
CHORUS: 
Oh, now that they grieve me, 
Now would you believe me, 
The day that they met me they always will rue; 
I'll tear them, I'll beat them, 
I'll fight them, I'll eat them 
As sure as my name it is Con Donahue. 
Oh, the quicker or sooner I 
take a 
big schooner, 
And pack up my trunks and cross the blue sea, 
I 
will not be fretting, but home I'll be getting 
To see all my folks whom are dearer to me; 
And when my dear mother, my sisters and brothers, 
When they will see me they won't know what to do; 
But with the gang I'll get even before I'll be leaving 
As true as my name it is Con Donahue. (Chorus

TWO BOLD IRISHMEN. 
Sung by SHEEHAN S: 
COYNE. 
[be, 
Behold in us two Irishmen, and we're as brave as brave can 
We march like soldiers through the street, in uniform so 
neat and gay; 
Marshal Dolan leads the troops, both up and down the big 
Broa d 
way, 
And the people shout as we turn out, hurrah for Patrick's 
Day. 
We look so grand as behind the band, we all gaily march 
away, 
Not a 
neater crowd in all the land, as we parade on that 
great day; 
We rally strong when duty calls on us to join the grand 
parade, 
For honor to our country must and always will by us be paid. 
So lead on, Marshal Dolan, for all gallant men are in your 
rear, 
And, every one will follow you without the slightest fear. 
When war's declared we'll be on hand, we'll be the first 
in all the land, 
To strike a 
blow for freedom and the rights of all Ameri-
cans; 
We are citizens in standing good, and we scorn any man 
that would 
Dare say a 
word 'gainst marching out on Patrick's Day in 
the morning. 
So now we'll leave you for awhile, our efforts were to 
make you smile, 
When we go away we hope you'll say that we have 
pleased you one and all; 
So wish us all the luck you can, and join together hand in 
hand. 
And drink success to Erin's Isle, the land that we were 
born in; 
Give three cheers for Patrick's Day, and when we're 
marching, shout hurrah. 
Well lift our hats to all the girls on Patrick's Day in the 
morning.

THE ASH BOX INSPECTOR." 
My name is Owen Slattery, I 
am a 
cobbler by trade; 
By mending your shoes me money I 
made. 
I 
have a 
devil's own wife; I 
wish she was dead; 
She can sing tralaloo, and she stands on her head. 
It was only last night that me daughtei Kate Ann 
Invited to supper a 
handsome young man. 
When asked his name he said it was Spoons, 
Recommended by Barnum for juggling spittoons. 
" 
Me fine laddie buck," says I, " March out of here, 
Or be the ghost of old Foley, I 
will bite off your ear." 
He made a 
rush for the door, with a 
Jump on his skull. 
He thought I 
was Ajax, or else Sitting Bull. 
Me wife, in a 
flutter, seized hold of a 
brick, 
And called me a 
slugger and flannel-mouth Mick.

guy."

short stop on the ball of her eye. 
There's Pat McNamara, from sweet Donegal, 
The ash box inspector, elected last fall; 
He wears a 
gold watch and chain and a 
scented boquet, 
I 
wish that the devil may wid him fly away. 
It %ras only this morning he sent me a 
card 
To fresco tit:: alley, and whitewash the yard. 
L'ad luck to the sucker, if I 
had him hece, 
would play seven-up on the edge of his ear.

Sung by JOHN SFIEEHAN. 
Ohs my name is Owen Reilly, 
• 
I've got a 
son that's got me crazy, 
He comes home every night wid his blackguard songs, 
He said lie learned them up at some free and aisy; 
He wanted his mother for to put on the boxing gloves wid him, 
He broke his little brother's leg wid a 
poker, 
He have an old deck of cards, and he wants me to play 
Pedro, Sancho, Seven-up and the Joker. 
He says he's taking sparring lessons from Professor Johh 
Donovan, 
He bate the oldest boy of cross-eyed McGarrity, 
He goes prancing around all the dances of the city, 
And he have a 
girl who do be dancing at the vulgarities. 
Oh, he pawned me Sunday pants last week, 
To go and lay a 
wager, 
And he brought me down the street that night, 
For to fight a 
big black nagur; 
There's his cousin Mike, a 
nice young man, 
Wid the finest kind of manners, 
Night after night they roamed about, 
And they called it carrying the banners. 
But the two of them got in a 
scrape, 
They stole a 
Dutchman's pony, 
Poor Mike is iu the workhouse now, 
And Bernard's in Aronagonia. 
Oh, he tied a 
can to our dog's tail, 
When we'd gone to church last Sunday, 
He got still staving tight, and stayed out that night, 
And he was up before the judge in the morning; 
He have the house turned inside out, 
He's gone to IU bad intirely, 
Be heavens I 
fear that hell be hung, 
God help you, Bernard Reilly. 
He kicked his sister, 11 °floral' in the forehead last week, 
He wanted custard pie for his supper; 
And he came home wid himself stuffed wid boileci oyster stews., 
And threw the corn beef and cabbage in the guttzz.

at JONES in their original sketch entitled " The Arrival 
of the Murphys." 
We are the Murphy twins, 
From the County of Kildare, 
We just arrived this morning, 
At the Castle Garden pier; 
We are looking out for Mulberry Stre,e 
Where lives our brother Dan, 
He is an American citizen, 
Likewise an alderman. 
CHORUS. 
We are the Murphy twins, 
From the County of Kildare, 
We have just arrived this morning, 
At Castle Garden pier; 
We crossed the stormy ocean, 
To become American citizens, 
Where could you find an Irish pair 
Could beat the Murphy twins. 
The morning we left Kildare, 
Our mother she did say— 
Hold up your heads me children, 
For you are going to America; 
You may become aristocrats,

Or Democrats, you know, 
But don't forget old Ireland, 
Wherever you may go.

As any in this land; 
But then I've had a 
sad downfall, 
And the blow I

For Margaret Jane, my oldest girl, 
Has lately run away; 
Wid Brignolia she's gone to sing— 
She's the star of the operia. 
ClIORt7S. 
She can sing in the key of forty-three; 
She's a 
voice like a 
young blue jay; 
She's as fine and grand as any in the land. 
Now she's gone wid the operia. 
I 
thought to fetch her back wid me, 
Till the place where I 
was born, 
For to wed a 
Prince or an Irish Duke, 
And she laughed at me wid scorn; 
She called me " Old Scully," and " Stab his ribs,' 
Told me go hire a 
dray, 
Pull down my chin, wipe ofi my vest, 
And come to the operia. 
She can sing, etc. 
MAN or EDUCATION.

JONES. 
Don't talk to me of your high toned men, 
And their fluent conversation; 
There's none with me, boys, can compare, 
I

An Irishman from Donegal. 
And the ladies all say, both one and all, 
I 
am a 
man of education. 
CHORUS. 
I

am never taken for Charley Ross, 
I'm a 
man of solid foundation; 
I 
will tell you, boys, that I'm the boss, 
And I 
am proud of my high station.

The boys all lift their hats and shout, 
For the man with education. 
I

Our Stage-Struek Daughter. 
Written by JonN SHEEHAN, and sung by SHEEHAN and JosEs with great 
success at Tony Pastor's. 
Pat McMonaghan, that is my name, 
And I 
have lately crossed the water; 
My heart it is completely broke, 
For I 
have a 
stage-struck daughter. 
She says she supports Edwin Boots, or Shoes, 
Mary Anderson whit her lays low ; 
Then thousand dollars is the salary she does ask, 
Or to the theatre she won't go. 
CHORUS. 
She has her mother's heart near broke, 
Whit play-acting she is crazy; 
Her mother wanted her to be a 
servant girl, 
But for work she was too lazy. 
She calls herself the leading lady 
In the Ballet or Can-Can; 
She is a 
perfect masher, and 
She broke upon the leading man. 
As a 
slack-wire dancer she is great, 
She plays the villian's part ; 
In the character of Juliet 
She broke poor Romeo's heart. 
She has her mother's heart, &c.

I am Mike Looney the Wrestler, 
Down me if you can; 
I 
threw Homer Lane in the gutter, 
Near killed John McMahon; 
I 
am the champion of Ireland, 
No one can give me a 
fall; 
When I 
threw Bibby and Miller, 
I 
am sure I 
can down them all. 
CHORUS: 
I 
can break McLaughlin in half, 
The girls on me are spooney; 
They all know I 
am the darling, 
I 
am the Wrestler, Mike Looney. 
Last Summer in England, 
I 
downed over thirty-eight; 
Queen Victoria kissed me, 
And said I 
could'nt be bate; 
I 
threw all the Frenchmen, 
Near broke their necks with the fall; 
Napoleon bet twenty-five dollars, 
That I 
could down them all.

BACK TO THE HID DART AGAIN. 
Written by HUGH J. 
GALLEN. 
Dedicated to SHEEHAN & Jos, the great Irish wrest-
lers. 
We are two Bons of Erin, 
We just came over here, 
From far across the deep blue sea, 
From a 
place we love so dear; 
With main and might, day and night, 
Our efforts have been in vain, 
We had no rest, so we think it best 
To go back to the Ould Dart again 
CHORUS. 
Oh, why did we ever lave it (sym.) 
Our hearts they now crave it (synt) 
We are two Irishmen, 
Both with might and main; 
All day we tread for work and bread, 
We'll go back to the Ould Dart again. 
When we left old Ireland, 
With spirits light and tree, 
We took a 
trip in a 
great big ship, 
And landed in America; 
The politicians met us, 
And said to us quite plain— 
Tweed with a 
pang, gave away the gang, 
And is back to the Ould Dart again. 
Oh, why, etc. 
And now, kind friends, we'll say good bye, 
We'll sing to you no more, 
We're going to cross the raging sea, 
To the home we do adore; 
And if we have not pleased you, 
We hope you won't complain, 
But with just cau§e give us applause, 
We're going back to the Ould Dart again. 
Oh, why, etc.

On 4th Ward Street near Cherry; 
l've a

He hangs with the crowd in the liquor store; 
He comes home and smashes his little sister, 
And he pawns the carpet on the floor. 
CHORUS: 
When I 
am going to Mass on a 
Sunday morning, 
They be spitting tobacco juice on the street; 
They'l holler Hennessy bathe your lungs, 
And get a 
plow and file your teeth. 
They dropped a 
whisky barrel on my head, 
And a 
pail of ashes and coals; 
Stole my papers and Election tickets, 
And chased me from the Polls; 
My son is the leader of the gang, 
Last Sunday I 
was nearly froze; 
I 
went down to the dock to have a 
swim, 
And walked home without any clothes.

FUN ON THE FARM. 
Written by EDWIN TALBOT. 
Music to suit these words for sale al 
WEllmAN's, 50 Chatham Street. Sung with great 
success by the HATLES. 
I 
love a 
little country lass, 
A 
charming, rustic queen; 
With eyes as bright as stars at night, 
Or noonday's radiant gleam. ' 
I 
meet her in the valley, 
I'm sure she knows no harm; 
She'll be here soon by the light of tbe m 
We'll have fun down on the farm. 
By gosh, what a 
squash, 
With a 
big banana and a 
pineapple too, 
We'll have fun, chewing gum, 
And fun down on the farm. 
Merry bees, gentle breeze, 
Warbling birdies flying through the trees; 
Happy day, among the hay, 
It's fun down on the Farm. 
A merry lad, he loves me, 
As you can plainly see; 
I 
see him every evening, 
He's waiting now for me. 
He'll meet me in the valley, 
As be has done before; 
With roses sweet, oh! what a 
treat, 
My love, my lardy dah.

Good Bye Polly. 
Sung with great success by EDWIN BARRY at the Theatre Comique. 
I 
loved a 
girl named Polly, and thought that she loved me.. 
So joined a 
ship to take a 
trip across the briny sea, 
And when the morning had arrived for me to sail away, 
I 
gave the lass a 
parting kiss, and then to her did say: 
CHORUS. 
Good bye Polly, I 
must leave you, 
Let us hppe the parting will not grieve you, 
The ship it sails to-day, some thousand miles away; 
So think of me when I 
am on the sea. 
She vowed that she'd be true to me while I 
was away, 
And thinking what she said was right, I 
left her my half pay; 
Then with a 
sigh bid her good-bye, and as they heaved the lead, 
I 
left her standing on the shore, then jumped aboard and said; 
Goodbye, Polly, &c. 
I 
saw her in my dreams at night, I 
thought of her all day, 
But did not think that she was false to me, when far away; 
For I 
must own when I 
alone, was lying on my bed, 
I 
often woke up in a 
fright, and these words have said; 
Good bye, Polly, &c. 
Some years had passed when I 
returned, with lots of gold 
in store,

PACES WE'LL NEVER FORGET. 
its sung by FRANK LEWIS at Hyde & 
Behman's Theatre, Brooklyn. 
I 
have sung of the topics and the events of the day, 
But now for the present I've something new to say; 
I 
will speak of the men you have heard of and seen, 
Whose name in our memory will ever be green; 
The first is a 
friend in the hour of need, 
Who will stretch forth his hand is a 
true friend indeed; 
When your pockets are empty, he'll stick to you yet. 
He's urie of the faces we'll never forget. 
I 
will speak first of one in our hearts ever dear, 
And I'm sure our whole nation still wish he was here; 
A Martyr, a 
President, and worthy of mind, 
The exponent of right and virtue combined; 
He was murdered in Washington some years ago, 
And how deeply our country has felt the blow; 
Though gone from us now, though gone, we find yet 
Old honest Abe Lincoln we'll never forget. 
New York in it day has proddeed some good men, 
Who are known from this city unto the world's end; 
There's William Cullen Bryant who handled the pen, 
That has silenced the wrath of this world's greatest men; 
There's poor Tweed who died in Ludlow Street Jail, 
Whose life was a 
warning, a 
history, a 
tale; 
There's Fisk who was shot down whose loss we regret, 
These are some of the faces we'll never forget. 
The stage it has likewise produced some good names, 
Who have struggled how hard for honor and fame; 
There's Cushman. Davenport, Forrest as well, 
Sothern and others too numerous to tell; 
There's one who'll remain in our hearts even more, 
Though she's gone from our midst unto Heaven's bright 
shore; 
As dear a 
little maiden the stage has had yet, 
Ella Mayo's sweet face we should nerer forget.

Cincinnati, Ohio. 
At night when we are lying on 
Our beds, secure and warm, 
We hear the mourning winds that tell, 
The coming of the storm; 
The lightning flashed, the thunder roared 
Around its childish glee, 
On such a 
night may God protect 
Our sailors on the sea. 
On such a 
night may God protect 
Our sailors on the sea. 
CLIORtis: 
Amidst the raging of the storm, 
We humbly ask of thee, 
Oh! Father, in thy mercy save 
Our sailors on the sea. 
Oh! Father, in thy mercy save 
Our sailors on the sea. 
The sailor little thinks, when he 
Lets out upon the wave, 
The worn-out ship in which he sails, 
May bear him to his grave; 
' 
Should storm arise, her rotten planks 
To pieces soon may go; 
Yet ships like this are sent to sea, 
That man may richer grow. 
Yet ships like this are sent to sea, 
That man may richer grow.

O'NEIL the great Irish Comedian and Vocalist with tremendous 
success, at the various theatres of the United States. 
I 
AM a 
true born Irishman, and I'll ne'er deny the same, 
I 
took a 
notion to cross the ocean, to America I 
came. 
When I 
landed here, it was in the year 1862. 
I 
was willing to fight, both day and night, for the Red, White 
and the Blue. 
CHORD'S. 
I 
am your Candidate for Alderman, so believe me what I 
say, 
Put on your coats, and cast your votes, for me on Election day. 
When I 
started first in Politics, my friends they were but few, 
I 
can't forget, everyone I 
met, said that I 
was too "brand new." 
I 
worked the pipes on the Boulevard, along with Mickey Hart, 
He was foreman over the old sixth ward, and the owner of a. 
big ash- cart. 
I 
am your candidate. &c. 
So now my friends I 
must be off, I 
can no longer stay, 
I 
hope you wont forget to vote, for me on Election day. 
And if I 
am the lucky man, on me you may depend, 
If you want to borrow, I 
wont be sorry, for I 
am the poor-man's 
_ 
friend. 
I 
am your candidate, & c._

71, 
I 
saw the dear old homestead, 
I 
saw it in a 
dream, 
I 
fancied I 
was gliding 
Along a 
rippling stream; 
Through sleeping waves and moonlight, 
I 
reached a 
pebbly Strand, 
And bounding from my shallop, 
I 
stood upon the land. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, lovely, lovely picture, 
So life-like and so bright, 
I'll hide it in my memory, 
That dream of yester-night. 
I 
saw the dear old homestead, 
The evening meal was spread, 
The candles in the window 
A 
welcome lustre shed; 
My gray-haired sire and mother 
My eager eyes could trace, 
And sisters, too, and brothers, 
There was no vacant place. 
I 
lingered just a 
moment 
Outside the open door, 
Then forward sprang to greet them, 
And clasp their hands once more; 
But ere my heart had spoken 
Its fullness of delight, 
Alas! my dream was broken, 
My dream of yester-night.

My name is O'Brien from Flarlem, 
An Irishman as you can see; 
I 
can sing like a 
thrush or a 
starling, 
Or the little bird up in a 
tree. 
But the gang that stands there on the corner, 
Are trying the steps and the dance; 
And they shout out whenever I'm passing, 
There's O'Brien with his high-water pants. 
CHORUS: 
They tell me to go over to England, 
And pay a 
short visit to France; 
And there to bring out my new fashions, 
And call them the high-water pants. 
Last week I 
went to the theatre, 
Along with my first cousin Dan; 
We hired a 
seat down in the parquette, 
Behind the big man in the band. 
When a 
nager came out with a 
banjo, 
lie played up a 
high-land clog dance; 
And he gave out a 
gag and a 
con-ram-drum, 
'Bout O'Brien and his high-water pants. 
One night as I 
strolled down the Bowery, 
Along with a 
friend, Paddy Brock. 
We tho't we'd just drop into Geoghan's, 
To try some of his rye and rock. 
When the gang all cried there's Dan O'Leary, 
The bar-keeper shot me a 
glance; 
" 
Howld your tongues " then said he to the loafets 
That's O'Brien with his high-water pants.

Over our heads, boys, flaunting to the breeze; 
Up to the peak greeting all lands and seas ! 
The emblem of Liberty, ever so true, 
That covers our Army and Navy of Blue. 
Peace be our motto, charity our cause, 
Faith to our colors, respect to our laws ! 
Friendship our greeting, our flag as it flew 
Inspired our brave Army and Navy of Blue.

Last Winter was a 
hard one, Mrs. Reilly, did you say? 
Well, 'tis myself that knows it; for it's many's the day 
Your husband wasn't the only man sat behind the wall; 
There's my old man McGuiness didn't get no job at all; 
The Politicians promised him work on the Boulevard, 
To handle a 
pick and shovel, and throw dirt on the cart. 
Ah, six months ago they promised him work he'd shortly 
get, 
But believe me, my good woman, they are promising him 
yet. ' 
CHORDS: 
Then cheer up, Mrs. Reilly, 
Don't give away to the blues, 
You and I 
will cut a 
shine, 
New bonnets and new shoes; 
As for me, I'm done a 
crying, 
No more will I 
sigh or sob, 
I'll wait till times gets better, 
When McGuiness gets a 
job. 
The Italians, the devil take them, why didn't they stay at 
home, 
Sure we bad plenty of our own class to ate up all our own; 
They come out like bees in Summer time and sworn for to 
stay; 
The contractors they have hundreds for forty cents a 
day, 
81 
WHEN McGUINESS GETS A JOB.—CoNmtuED. 
They work upon the railroad, they shovel snow and slush, 
But .there's one thing in their favor, Italians they never do 
get lush; 
to, they always bring their money home, taste no gin or, 
wine, 
A.nd that's one thing I'd like to say of your old man and 
mine. 
Then cheer up, Mrs. Reilly, etc. 
Ali! the Spring time now is coming we'll all have plenty 
work, 
qcGuiness will go back to his trade, shure he's a 
hand, 
some clerk. 
You should see him climb the ladder as nimble as a 
fox, 
Faith he's the. 
boy can handle the ould three-cornered box, 
The boss is always bawling, Hi! there, don't you stop, 
Keep your eyes upward, don't let no mortar drop; 
kli! the old man he is always careful, nothing he let's 
fall, 
The divil a 
word you'd hear him say to my old man at all. 
Then cheer up, Mrs. Reilly, etc.

Out of Employment. 
RECITATION . 
Written by DAN SULLY for Miss DAISY REMINGTON, and recited by he 
with great success in the principal theatres. 
Out of employment, starvation in view, 
Now what has a 
poor man in my place to do ? 
Weary I 
wander, careworn and sad, 
I'm looking for work, and there's none to be had. 
Choosing rather to die than to beg or to steal, 
The sharp pangs of hunger I 
try to conceal; 
Weary I 
wander, sadly I 
roam, 
To earn food for the little ones starving at home. 
Vain, vain are those tears, but still they will flow, 
To yield to despair is womanly, I 
know; 
I 
must choke down the lump which will rise in my throat, 
And strive to live on, though I 
have not a 
groat. 
Yes, I'll strive to live on, though again and again 
Does the mad thought of suicide flash through my brain; 
Dinnerless, supperless, still I 
must roam, 
To earn food for the little ones starving at home. 
Now, why should a 
man, be he Christian or Turk, 
Be doomed to such hardships while he's willing to work? 
For months I've been wandering half crazed through 
your town, 
Till my strength is nigh gone and I'm quite broken down. 
Oh, God : it were better, perhaps, to be dead, 
For they won't give me work, and I 
can't beg my bread; 
No money, no work, sadly I 
roam. 
There's no help for the little ones starving at home.

The Man in the Moon is Looking, Love. 
As sung by LULA MOATIMOR. 
Published by E. H. HARDING, 
229 Bowery, New York. 
You all know what this feeling is, 
When at some quiet spot, 
All around you may be ice. 
But the love's burning hot. 
Of course her hand so tight you squeeze, 
As you both gaze afar; 
Yes, while the moon is laughing at you, 
Knowing what fools you are. 
SPOKEN.—When you are in love, and sitting on some TO-
tantic cliff, by the light of the moon you gaze in the girl's 
face, and imagine how much powder and rouge she has been 
putting on; and she's thinking at the same time what express-
ive eyes, how his nose turns up, and I 
think I 
should love him 
a 
little more if it was a Roman, and the moon is winking at 
you and seems to say— 
Cuo.—The man in the moon is looking, love, 
He's winking, love, he's blinking, love; 
And each little star can tell where you are, 
The man in the moon is looking. 
The other night, on Dover cliffs, 
A 
girl sat there with me; 
The moon above kept peeping on'. 
With look of naughty glee. 
I 
whispered tales of love, and said, 
Don't be a 
timid miss, 
But while the moon's behind a 
cloud 
Just one sweet little kiss. 
SPOKEN. — Not now. 
Don't you see the man ? 
What man ? 
Why, the man in the moon! 
He's laughing at us. 
But just 
one, dear! 
No, no!—(Ctionus.) 
As we sat gazing at the moon, 
Like spooney lovers do, 
My arm of course was round her waist, 
Nigh squeezing her in two. 
I 
heard the moon say to the stars, 
That pair I'll go and wed, 
And as the moon came from above, 
I 
rolled clean out of bed. 
SPOKEN.—It was a 
dream. 
I 
was not on Dover cliff sitting 
with a 
girl by moonlight. 
I was in bed at Brixton with a 
ruahlight shining upon me, and dreaming it was the moon, and 
my darling Matilda saying—iCaoRus.)

:0:-
I 
spoon a 
girl named Mary Ann, a 
tender little dove, 
Who costs me lots of half-pence, and a 
precious deal of love; 
She's living with her mother, as a 
maiden ought to do, 
And looks as straight and proper as a 
saint, or me or you. 
But somehow when I 
trot her round, no matter where we go, 
I'm struck with all the people that this maiden seems to 
know; 
For certain as Mary Ann I 
proudly take about, 
Some heads pop round the corner and a 
vulgar voice will 
shout— 
CHoituS 
Oh, very well, Mary Ann, I'll tell your Ma, 
She little thought when you came out you'd go so far; 
I'm sure your mother doesn't know the girl you are, 
Mary Ann, fie! for shame, Yah! yah! yah! Oh! yah! 
We went last Whitsun Monday to the forest by the rail, 
We did the thing first class of course,- at that I 
never fail, 
I 
tipp'd the guard a 
shilling, or what you might call a 
bob, 
To lock us in a 
carriage and preserve us from the mob. 
We sat on downy cushions and the curtains drew for fun, 
For Polly said her pretty eyes they could not bear the sun; 
But when we settled snugly and were just about to go, 
A head came through the window and a 
fellow shouted— 
(Chorus). 
87 
. MARY ANN, 
I'LL TELL YOUR MA . —CONTINUED. 
We wander'd through the forest glades as happy as could be, 
We thought from vulgar people there, we should at least 
be free; 
We sought a 
sweet secluded spot, where none our vows 
could hear, 
And whisper'd those soft, silly things, that lovers think so 
dear. 
We sat beneath a 
spreading oak, our loving arms entwined, 
While I 
was fond and foolish, she was gentle, sweet and 
kind; 
But just as I 
my passion told, and sealed it with a 
kiss, 
A chap birds-nesting up above, so rudely shouted this— 
(Chorus), 
We came away disgusted, and we quickly made for home, 
For everywhere we met the cry, no matter where we'd 
roam; 
My Mary Ann declared to me she knew those people not, 
In fact, she said she would not mix with such a 
vulgar lot. 
But on this precious mystery I 
have some little doubt, 
And almost think that Mary Ann must know her way about; 
For when we parted at her door, or rather just inside, 
A voice came down the staircase, and her little brother 
cried— 
SOKEN.— Oh ! 
oh! oh! 
(Chorus).

There's sixteen dacent families 
In the house where I 
reside; 
On summer nights to cheer ourselves, 
All pleaures we have tried; 
But on the roof it's best of all, 
To hear us would be proof; 
We make the neighborhood resound, 
AU singing on the roof. 
Singing on the roof, the boys and girls together, 
- 
We play the concertina, likewise the sweet banjo; 
The Mtuphys and O'Neils come up to see the weather, 
We're highly elevated until we go below. 
Now up comes Mistress Hoolahan, 
With the baby in her arms; 
With pleasant conversation then, 
Sure every one she char,ms; 
There's Rosy Dunn and Reiley's son, 
And a 
Russian named O'Goofe, 
With voices loud they join the crowd, 
All singing on the roof. (Chorus). 
Young Roger Flynn got up to dance, 
With a 
lady from next door; 
"Come welt the tin " says Hotter Flynn, 
"It's like a 
ball- room oor;" 
Then one by one they joined the fun, 
Sure, none could hold aloof, 
It was a 
sight that sumniefni,?-ht, 
To see them on the roof. (Chorus), 
Now that's the place TO spend the night, 
And feel that pl,asanz breeze; 
Take up your pipe and stretch yourself, 
In an attitude of ease; 
The boys and girls will gather round, 
And fill the air with glee; 
When singing on the roof at night, 
As happy as can be. ( Chorus).

Sung by 
M ISS KITTY COLEMAN. 
I'm far away from the home I 
love, 
And my heart is sad and forlorn; 
I (Awn think of my boyhood hours, 
Also the place where I 
was born. 
But Nellie my darling awaits my return, 
IIer sweet face I'm longing to see; 
There's a sighing in my heart which keeps 
whispering, 
There's a 
dear one waiting for me. 
CHORUS: 
I'll soon return to my home again, 
how happy then I 
will be; 
When I'm welcomed back by my Nellie, 
For my darling is waiting for me. 
I've traveled across the ocean wide, 
And in strange countries have I 
been; 
I've been among people of all kinds, 
But no place like home have I 
seen. 
I'm longing to be back with my little dear, 
To my home across the wide sea; 
Oh, I'm weary and sad since we parted, 
There's a 
dear one waiting for me. 
While thinking about my childhood's days, 
When I 
used to play on the green; 
How oft I've roamed with my Nellie dear, 
I 
love to recall those bright scenes. 
Remembered and cherished are those childish 
hours, 
A wander no longer I'll be; 
For my darling is waiting and watching, 
There's a 
dear one waiting for me.

Usher, COTTIER & DENTON, 209 Main St., Buffalo, N. 'Y. 
Far away in sunny meadows, 
Where the merry sunbeams play'd, 
Oft I 
lingered 'mid the clover 
Singing to a 
village maid; 
She was fairer than the fairest, 
Ever faithful, fond and true, 
And she wore beneath a 
bonnet 
Amber tresses tied in blue. 
Cnoups. 
She was fairer than the fairest, 
Ever faithful, fond and true, 
And she wore beneath a 
bonnet 
Amber tresses tied in blue. 
Ere Cie summer days departed, 
.We had made a 
solemn vow, 
And I 
never, never wearied 
Kissing her sweet cheek and brow; 
She was dearer than the dearest, 
Pure as crops of morning dew, 
And adown her neck was hanging 
Amber tres3es tied in blue. 
She was fair Ito 
'Twas decreed that fate should part us 
Ere the leaves of autumn fell, 
And two loving hearts were severed 
That had loved each other well; 
She was all I 
had to cherish, 
She has bade a 
last adieu, 
And I 
see in ey'ry vision 
Amber tresses tied in blue. 
She was fairer, ie.

Sure I'm a 
high-toned 'ristocrat, 
As you can plainly see; 
I'm known by everybody, 
No matter where I 
may be. 
My influence is wonderful, 
Whenever I 
take the stand; 
And if you want a 
thoroughbred, 
Why 3Ialoney is the man. 
CHORUS: 
For Maloney's a 
man, let ye understand, 
Who is well educated and tony; 
His influence is great, sure he takes the cake, 
There's no such a 
man as Maloney. 
You can see that I'm no fighter, 
And always take things cool; 
But if the boys make fun of me, 
They'll find that I'm no fool. 
I'm up and up with every one, 
There's no better in the land; 
So if you want an honest friend, 
Why Maloney is the man. 
The Tramp. 
As recited by DAN' COLINER. 
Lemme sit down a 
minute, a 
stone's got in my shoe; 
Don't you commence your cussin', I 
ain't done nothin' to you. 
Yes, I'm a 
tramp. 
What of it ? 
Folks say we ain't no good 
But tramps has to live, I 
reckon, though folks don't think we 
should. 
Once I 
was strong and handsome, had plenty of cash and 
clothes, 
That was afore I 
tippled and gin got into my nose 
Down in the Lehigh Valley me and my peonle gew, 
I 
was a 
blacksmith, Cap'en—yes, and a 
good one, too; 
Me and my wife and Nellie. 
Nellie was just sixteen, 
She was the pootiest creeter the Valley had ever seen. 
Beaux 
Why, she had a 
dozen—had ' em from near and fur, 
But they were mostly farmers--none of 'em suited her. 
There was a 
city stranger—young, handsome, and tall, 
Damn him— I 
wish I 
had him strangled agin that wall. 
'He was the man for Nellie—she didn't know no ill ; 
Mother, she tried to stop it, but you know a 
young gal's will. 
Well, it's the same old story— common enough, you'll say, 
He was a 
soft-tongued devil, and got her to run away. 
More than a 
month or after we heard from the poor young 
thing, 
He'd gone away and left her without a 
wedding ring. 
Back to her home we brought het, back to her mother's side, 
Filled with a 
raging fever—she fell at my feet and died. 
Frantic with shame and trouble, her mother began to sink, 
Dead— in less than a 
fortnight—that's when I 
took to drink. 
Gimme one glass, Curnel, and then I'll be on my way, 
VU tramp till I 
find that scoundrel, if it takes till the Judg-
ment Day.

McCORMICK'S MULE. 
Written by JAMES RICHMOND. 
Recited by PAT ROONEY with great success. 
McCormick had a 
Jack- ass, 
Blind in the teeth, lame in one eye; 
lie had a 
celebrated record, 
For eating water and drinking pie; 
This Jack-ass was a 
high kicker, 
He won many an undisputed prize; 
He kicked out seven rows of Mrs. Murphy's teeth, 
And jabbed out both her eyes. 
McCormick's Mule% 
This mule was born in Ireland, 
lie wears the Shamrock on his nose; 
At the Centennial he stole an iron safe, 
And dressed himself in a 
suit of clothes; 
He broke into a 
Jewelry store, 
Stabbed the proprietor with a 
nail; 
Chased four Policeman into the river, 
And set fire to the Jail. 
McCormick's Mule. 
McCormick was arrested, and produced the mule, 
For him all the neighbors had a 
grudge; 
He slapped the Jury in the mouth with his tail, 
And kicked the neck-tie off the Judge; 
The mule escaped, and they held McCormick, 
For the doings of the mule he was tried; 
lie was just getting ten years' sentence, 
When a 
telegram came the mule had died. 
McCormick's Mule. 
Moral on his Grave-Stone. 
Judge me as a 
Jack-ass, 
Or judge me as a 
fool; 
I 
was smarter than some politicians, 
That went to Grammar School; 
I 
had the brains of a 
mighty man, 
But for one I 
could not pass; 
So please have printed on my grave, 
McCormick's little Jack-ass.

THE SPADE 
A.N originally sung by GRIFF BOWDZIG 
GIVE me the Spade and the man who can use it: 
A 
fig for your lord, and his soft silken hands, 
Let the man who has strength never stoop to abuse it, 
Give back to the giver—the land, boys, the land. 
There's no bank like the Earth to deposit your labor, 
The more you deposit the more you shall have; 
If there's more than you want you can give to your neighb5c, 
And your name shall be dear to the true and the brave. 
Cnor.us.—Give me the spa4,

C. 
Gtve me the spade—the American's glory— 
That fashions the field from the bleak barren moor, 
Let us speak cf its praise in ballad and story, 
While ' tis brightened with labor, not tarnished with gore. 
It was not the Sword that won our best battles, 
Created our Commerce, extended our Trade, 
Gave food for our wives, our children, our cattle, 
But the queen of all weapons—the Spade, boys, the Spat. 
Give me the spade, kte. 
Give me the Spade, there's a 
magic about it, 
That turns the black soil Into bright shining gold, 
What would our fathers have done, boys, without, 
When this land lay all bare and the north wind blew cold. 
Where the tall forests stood, and the wild beasts were yelling, 
Where our stout-hearted ancestors shrank back afraid— 
Now the cornstack is raised and have cleared a 
dwelling, 
Thi4u livrail for oft:J. true Mead, the Spade, boys, the Spada

With an Irish band in front of us, we then will fall in line. 
We do honor to St. Patrick, ould Ireland's greatest saint, 
Be gob, whin we turn out, me boys, we make the ladies faint.

COMIC CHARACTER SONG. 
Words and music 
Sung with great success by 
MURPHY and MAcx. 
It's very strange indeed to me, that go where'er I 
may, 
So many queer remarks 1 
hear about me every day; 
'Twas but last night upon the street, my style the boys did quiz, 
And one says " You can have it pards, if you guess what it is !" 
SPOKEN—As 
soon as they saw me they shouted, " Here it 
comes !" and as I 
approach they all began to sing— 
CHORUS. 
What is it ? heavens what is it ? 
Does it live do you know ? or is it a 
chromo? 
Did it blow out, or did it grow out ? 
Oh ! for heaven's sake, what is it ? 
'Twas in the Park, a 
lively mob at me did talk and stare, 
" 
I 
wonder if it's loaded, and if that's all its own hair," 
"It lives, it breathes," one chap did say, its pulse is all serene. 
Approaching me " Old Krank," says he, " I'll see that you're 
kept green ! 
SPOKEN—Yes, and when I 
say a 
word back, they shout, 
" 
Look out for it, it's teethin' !" and then again comes the 
conundrum— 
What is it, &c. 
They asked how long I 
walked alone, and say " when were 
you canned ?" 
And hint I'd look much better if upon my head I'd stand; 
And as around the Square I 
walk, with gloves and cane and 
pipe, 
I 
heard them whisper everywhere, " I 
wonder if it's ripe !" 
SPOKEN—Yes, they want to know if I'm natural or artificial, 
and how many of me there are in a 
bunch, and whether I'm 
good raw I Bgt abavg 7.11 they wildly ask—

I 
CAN'T UNDERSTAND, CAN YOU? 
Written and sung at Harry Miner's Theatre. N, Y., by FRANK LEWIS, 
with unbounded applause. 
I'm not a 
wise man, but yet I'm no fool, 
I'm an American boy strong and hearty, 
I 
never mix up in political rings, 
I 
belong to the workingmen's party; 
There's the devil to pay in the papers each day, 
And half what you read may be true; 
But why people believe every word that they say, 
I 
can't understand, can you? 
CHORUS: 
I 
can't understand, can you? 
I 
don't understand, do you? 
Why Russia's great Czar was blown from hts car, 
I 
can't understand, can you? 
Now there's Mr. Jones, my neighbor next door, 
Of a 
family he has quite a 
number; 
He's been married, I 
think about six years or more 
With six babies his life to encumber; 
While there is poor me, :who's been wed about three 
And as yet there is nothing to show; 
But why such things should be, is quite funny to 
And I 
can't understand, can you? [me, 
CHORUS: 
I 
can't understand, can you? 
I 
don't understand, do you? 
Why our Commissioners haven't seen that our 
streets are kept clean, 
I 
can't understand it, can you?

I 
CAN'T UNDERSTAND, CAN YOU?—CONTINUED 
Now there's General Grant, our Ex-President, 
He fought for the Star Spangled Banner; 
But the people do say that he'll fast forty days, 
For every one knows he's a 
Tanner; 
He has also been over Europe I'm told, 
They say he's as rich as a 
Jew; 
But why he don't retire to sweet_private life, 
I 
can't understand, can you? 
CHORUS; 
I 
can't understand, can you? 
I 
don't understand, do you? 
Why we have a 
Mayor, by the way, who says 
Grace every day, 
I

There's the handsome young lady, the belle of the 
day, 
Who is always dressed up in the fashion; 
Her beautiful form is developed to sight, 
She looks very stylish and dashing; 
With a 
sweet little bang on the front of her head, 
And she's made up quite pretty to view; 
But why she combs her hair on the back of a 
chair 
I 
can't understand, can you?

In a 
cosy cottage painted green, 
About three miles from here, 
There lives a 
pretty Irish queen, 
To me she does prove dear. 
Her mother takes in washing, 
And the girl helps at the trade, 
And when I've called upon her 
These words I've often said; 
CHORUS. 
Mary Ann McLaughlin, don't you cry, 
Take that apron from your eye ; 
Don't you let the neighbors hear you sigh, 
And we'll be married by-and-by. 
Now soon I'm going to married be, 
Of course I'll settle down; 
I'll buy a 
house, also a 
farm, 
A 
short way out of town. 
Oh, then it will be joyful, 
When as cosy as a 
mouse; 
To see the young O'Malleys 
Play tag around the house. 
Mary Ann McLaughlin, &c.

My name it is McGinty, yes, 
I 
live on ham and Hour, 
With O'Leary, the walker, I 
came here, 
For to walk a. mile an hour, 
About half past twelve o'clock last nigbi 
A 
gang gave me a 
terrible fright, 
They woke me up and set me tight, 
For to walk against O'Leary. 
They took me to a 
great big field, 
And with alcohol set me crazy, 
They stripped me clothes off to the skin, 
And rt made me feel so lazy; 
It was then the gang commenced to talk, 
Saying who is the terrier going to walk, 
And they said they would hang me if I'd batik 
When I 
walked against O'Leary. 
The first mile I 
walked my legs were weak, 
And the gang commenced to holler, 
They sptinkled salt upon the track 
And hit me with an iron dollar. 
All the other walkers were ahead, 
Eating sponge cake, pie and bread, 
0 
heavens, I 
wish that I 
was dee.d, 
When I 
walked against O'Leary. 
I 
walked until I 
catched the cramps, 
Around and around the track, 
All the ladies threw bouquets at me, 
There was a 
corn upon my back; 
The judge told me it was tine to stop 
As around the track like a 
chicken I'd flop, 
For the want of a 
whiskey I 
though I'd drop, 
The day I 
walkadvl.ast O'Leary.

You Were False, But I'll Forgive You, 
PITY THE POOR. 
)opyrighted, 1880, by B. W. HITCHCOCK, 166 Nassau Street, 
New York. Sung by Wimmat DWYER. 
Published by permission. 
Pity the poor this cold winter night, 
Keen blows the wind with merciless might, 
Fat falls the snow, oh, turn not away! 
Hunger and want on every hand stray; 
Give of a 
portion Heaven has sent, 
Ye who are blessed with wealth and content, 
Ye who have homes so cheerful and bright, 
Pity the poor this cold winter night. 
CHORUS: 
Turn not away, give, give of your store, 
Some weary heart make happy once more; 
Harl_ to their cry, their pleading don't slight, 
Pity the poor this cold winter night. 
Cheerfully give and God will return, 
Thy brother's call, oh never more spurn, 
Always with us the poor still abide, 
Pass them not by, and turn not aside; 
Shivering forms with no where to go, 
Wearily plod, or crouch in the snow; 
Spare what you can, if only a 
mite, 
Pity the poor this cold Winter night. (Chorus), 
Do what you can, while journeying here, 
Some weary soul we always may cheer, 
Lighten the load of poverty's curse, 
All can spare some, though meagre their purse; 
Blessings and joys your days will pursue, 
Many are poor, the wealthy are few; 
All could be helped, if all give their mite, 
Pity the poor this cold winter night. 
Sung with immense success by Miss Georgie Melnotte 
the Queen Serio-Comique. 
Fare thee well, for once I 
loved you, 
Even more than tongue can tell, 
Little did I 
think you'd leave me, 
Now I 
bid you all farewell. 
You have wrecked the heart I 
cherished, 
You have doomed me day by day, 
You are false but I'll forgive you, 
But forget you I 
never may. 
[Repeat last two lines.; 
When I 
saw your eys
ess in virtue, 
I 
could scarce believe my own, 
When I 
heard your voice in anger, 
It was death to every tone. 
They have told you some false stories, 
And you believed them all they say, 
You are false but I'll forgive you, 
But forget you I 
never may. 
[Repeat last two lines 
One more word and all is over, 
Why are you unkind to me? 
Tell me why you do not love me, 
Turn aside how can it be ? 
No word not one word of pleasure, 
You believe them all they say, 
You are false but I'll forgive you, 
But forget you I 
never may.

Brothers and sisters will you all draw nigh,

So tell dem not to weep and sigh,

Cuoltus: 
De angels am a 
coming, 
Dar voices am so clear; 
I 
hear dere harps a 
ringing, 
Dey must be almost here. 
Standing in the line waiting to get through, 
Lots of colored bretheren I 
tell you, 
Be sure and wear your gospel shoes, 
De angels am a 
coining; 
Gabriel's standing dar blowing loud on his horn, 
Waking darkies at de break of morn, 
So be dar just as sure's you're born, 
De angels am a 
coming. 
(Chorus) • 
Garments and robes must all be white and clear, 
A 
glorious sight when we do appear, 
De children must be in good cheer, 
De angels am a

De horn will blow and de bell will ring, 
De time am come for to flap your wings, 
So tell me what you're gwine to sing, 
De angels am a 
coming. (Chorus).

IT PLEASES BOTH OLD AND YOUNG, 
it is a Fac simile of a Trick practiced by all 
the _Professors of Magic. 
It is arranged so systematically, and is accom-
panied with directions so plainly written, that, with 
a 
single perusal, any person may become an adept 
in an unfailing b,urce of amusement. 
Read what a leading Journal says of it: 
" 
Au ingenious little book of the thaumaturgic ordes 
has been sent us, called litrUPTY DumPrry,' and bound 
in such a 
way as to give opportunity for a 
decidedly 
puzzling trick. 
While presenting the ordinary appear-
ance of a 
child's picture-book, gayly printed and colored, 
it is so bound that a 
practiced manipulator, taking it 
up, and flirting the leaves rapidly over, can make it ap • 
pear to be filled with copies of only one picture, or with 
blank pages, or with any one - 
of quite a 
succession 
of 
figures. 
t3One minute the pamphlet, quickly thumbed, 
appears to contain nothing but portraits of Harlequin, 
in his tesselated suit; the next, only Columbine; then, 
nothing but Pantaloon, or Biding Hood, or Mephisto-
pheles. A little practice, and the directions printed 
with the book will make any-body at .home in the hand-
ling of it."—Phila. Evening Bulletin.'
