While the chorus you swell, 
Of the blokes doing time

CHORUS. 
'With my one, two, and three four, 
Then all in a

To the shoe shop and quarry 
Each bloke must keep time. 
We work like a

Is the Isle de Blackwell

Oh, there is a

He tripped and he fell, 
Singing Moody and Sankey

With my one, two, etc. 
Oh there is a 
baby, 
'Tis a 
pity he's here, 
He was nabbed by a 
hipper 
A- shoving the queer. 
His people are 'lobby, 
On the avenue they swell, 
He's a 
family skeleton 
On the Isle de Blackwell. 
With my one, two, etc. 
There's Scotty, our keeper, 
We all know his snoot, 
He collars the old tozs 
Then hands out a 
suit 
Striped like a 
zebra; 
Then its good-bye, farewell, 
We're regular boarders 
On the Isle de Blackwell.

No pivoter could equal her,

Sung in HARRIGAN & HART'S Broadway Statuettes. 
Copyright by A. J. 
FISTIER, 1878. 
HERE'S Roscoe Claude liontvedo, 
Fresh from Madison Square; 
Perfumed with balm of roses, 
Magnolia on my hair; 
My style infatuating, 
I 
am one of the F. F. A's— 
First families of the avenue, 
Par excellence au lad.. 
I 
flirt, I 
kiss 
With the cherubs as they pass; 
Brunettes, sweet pets, 
And every pretty lass. 
At Long Branch in the summer, 
With every pretty dear, 
I 
play croquet to hear them say, 
He's the Apollo Belvidere. 
My gait a 
layarisian, 
My sister's name is Maude; 
In a 
ladies' seminary 
I 
pay her monthly board. 
She is such an aggravation, 
A 
delicious, sly coquette, 
French poodles and canary birds 
Are sister's favorite pets. 
Oh, George! oh, Maude! 
Now take your arm away I 
You're rude—so crude! 
What would my mamma say? 
At all the bonton socials, 
With every pretty dear, 
I 
waltz so gay to hear them say, 
He's the Apollo Belvidere. 
My pa's a 
large contractor, 
He supplies the army shoes 
To the soldiers on the prairie— 
I 
mean the boys in blue. 
His face is classic G.ecian; 
Pm the picture of my pa— 
I'm the ladies' fascinator, 
Oh, at Sar-a-to-gu-ah! 
Oh dear 1 
oh my! 
Oh do not tease me, Will! 
You wretch— you're fresh! 
You really must keep still 
I'm such a: romantic fellow, 
Now don't you think it queer ? 
I'm so delightfully mellow, is 
The Apollo Belvidere. 
LOOKED OUT AFTER NINE. 
Sung in his Burlesque Lady of Lyons. 
1'21 stopping at a 
boarding-houso 
Kept by Misses Doyle; 
The rules and regulations 
Are forninst us all the while. 
Two meals a 
day was all we got, 
We set down in a 
line. 
'Twas every man in bed at eight, 
Or locked out after nine. 
Cnonts. 
There was Slotty MeGonigal, 
McAllister and O'Burke, 
A 
Scanandavian fisherman, 
A 
Norwegian and Turk. 
The ladies, the babies, 
Were crying all the time, 
Every man in bed at eight, 
Or locked out after nine. 
At a 
rousing demonstration, 
Held up in Union Square, 
Tammany Hall Republicans 
And anti-Tams was there. 
Our boarders congregated 
To see the sight so fine; 
Gilligan wanted it stopped at eight, 
We got home after nine. 
There was Slotty McGonigal, etc. 
There was Slotty MeGonigal 
A 
kicking on the door, 
The ladies and the babies 
For Miss Doyle did roar. 
We woke up all the neighbors, 
The tailor Constantine 
Turned out the fire department 
When we was locked out after nine. 
There was Slotty MeGonigal, etc. 
There was a 
row next morning, 
Wid all the boarders drunk; 
Miss Doyle she got excited. 
And threw out every trunk. 
Hat boxes and valises, 
And shirts from off the line, 
Came out wid all the lodgers 
Bekase we got home after nine. 
There was Slotty MeGonigal, etc. 
Wid vengeance they did roar; 
They rushed for bricks 
And heavy sticks 
To batter down the door. 
'Twas then they got the collar, 
Three long months wid a 
fine, 
Was their conciliation 
For coming home after nine. 
There was Slotty McGonigal, etc.

THE SUMMER OF LIFE 
Dedicated to EDWARD HARRIGAN. 
By Sons ERIGENA BARRETT, Author of " Love and Labor." 
0, Tun summer of life is a 
joyous time ' 
When the eye is undimm'd by care, 
When the bosom responds to each thought sublime,' 
And cad 
lv prospect on earth is fair, 
When love lights his lamp at each beautiful shrine. 
And whispers we'll never grow old, 
When happiness lingers in lips half divine 
Whose smiles are more precious than gold., 
Cucmus. 
Then let ago do its worst 
In this wide world of strife, 
It can never rob me 
Of the Summer of Life. 
They say friends prove false and that pleasure's a 
sham 
That passes from the touch like a 
dream, 
But while youth is mine I'll be just what I 
am, 
And never endeavor to seem 
A 
slave unto sorrow or whitening hairs: 
Let time march along, I'll be gay; 
Let those who enjoy them have troubles and cares, 
But I'll have mirth while I 
may. 
Then let care, etc. 
If wrinkles should come then I'll laugh them away; 
They cannot abide where there's cheer, 
With a 
jolly ha, ha, they never can stay, 
No wrinkles for me while I'm here. 
But sunshine and laughter and song to the last, 
And some one I 
love for my wife, 
Then the tempests may howl, the frosts may fall fast, 
I'll bask in the Summer of Life. 
Then let old age do its worst, etc.

BOTANY BAY. 
By EDWARD HARRIGAN'. 
On, I 
was reared in White Chapel, 
A 'prentice I 
was bound; 
No livlier kid was ever known 
Her majesty's country round. 
I 
cut the master short one day 
And started off alone, 
And went to swiping handkerchiefs 
Not many miles from home. 
CHORUS. 
They shipped me far away 
To a 
penal colony 
Across the deep blue water 
To the isle of Australia. 
I 
took leg bail one day, 
I 
could no longer stay; 
I 
slipped the gaol with a 
pleasant gale, 
And sailed from Botany Bay. 
I 
know a 
littth. barmaid, 
All at the Royal Arms; 
She is sweet on this re covey 
And his agg-ravatIng charms. 
Her parents call her Dolly, 
I 
call her Doll for short; 
I 
gives her silken kerchief, 
And that's how her I 
caught. 
They shipped me, etc. 
I 
did a 
bit in Newgate, 
Likewise at old Bridewell; 
Like Claude Duval and his jolly pal, 
Carved my name all in the cell. 
On the old treadmill its all up hill, 
It goes against the grain 
Of Sammy Slap, the cleverest chap 
From Costermonger Lane. 
They shipped me, etc. 
IT'S very queer when I 
came here 
I 
was christened right away. 
When I 
walk out I 
hear folks shout, 
" 
Lord Taffy I Hi, I 
say 1" 
I 
had heard of your improvement, 
So I 
determined for to go 
And leave my home and sail alone 
Incognitio 1 
CHORUS. 
I'm Lord Taffy in this country, you see; 
Really acknowledged a 
daisy, you know. 
Don't let it slip, I'll give you the tip, 
I'm Lord Arthur Gooseberry Incognitio. 
In Houston Street I 
had a 
treat 
At a 
place called Harry Hill's; 
I'd a 
drop of beer with a 
chap so queer, t 
Who wished me to foot the bills. 
'Twas then 1 
became indignant, 
Said " I'm a 
Lord, sir. you must know!" , 
I 
heard a 
shout throw Taffy out 
Incognitio I 
I'm Lord Taffy, etc. 
At my hotel I'm treated well, 
Oh, in fact, quite royally; 
It's quite a 
lark—they're in the dark 
As to my nobility. 
So I 
register Lord, ahl with a 
blank, 
From London so and so, 
To hear them laugh and say it's Taff 
Incognitio 
I'm Lord Taffy, etc.

We contimplate to go home again.

Whin we lave you of course ' twill grieve you, 
So farewell, boys, we'll go home again, 
Whin we're talking, or out a

To console ourselves wid a 
quiet chat, 
The little boys they do make a 
noise, 
Saying " will ye iver go an' shoot that hat 1" 
Those observations an' consultations 
Is sure enough to turn our brains!

To take the first ship home again.

EVA sleeps 'neath the willow, our darling's at rest; 
They folded her tiny hands above her breast, 
And from her white forehead, so marble and cold, 
Then tenderly parted her ringlets of gold. 
Where lingers the shadows at close of the day, 
'Neath the sods of the valley they laid her away. 
Eva, dear Eva, our treasure, our love, 
Singing hosannah with angels above. 
CHORUS. 
Under the violets forever she sleeps, 
Where the pale moon and stars nightly over her weep. 
Eva, dear Eva, our treasure, our love, 
Singing hosannah with angels above. 
We bow to thy mercy, thou giver of all, 
Who tenderly watches the small sparrows fall 
But tis hard that the angel thou give us in trust, 
In our warm love should wither and crumble to dust. 
But in infinite mercy you gave us to see 
How pure and unspotless an angel could be. 
Eva, dear Eva, our treasure, our love, 
Singing hosannah with angels above. 
Eva, dear Eva, etc. 
'TWAS one fine summer's morning, when flowers they were a 
blooming, oh, 
And meadows were adorning, and small birds sweetly singing, 
oh, 
I 
met my love near Banbridge Town, my charming, blooming 
Sally, oh I 
And she is the beauty of County Down, and the Flower of 
Macheralliea, oh. 
With admiration I 
did gaze upon this blooming maiden, oh; 
Sure, Adam never was more struck when he first saw Eve in 
Eden, oh. 
Her skin was like the lily white that blooms in yonder valley, 
oh, 
And I 
think I 
am blessed when I 
am nigh wit i 
the Flower of 
Macheralliea, oh. 
Her yellow hair in ringlets fair, her shoes were Spanish leath-
er, oh ; 
Her bonnet with blue ribbons strung, and her scarlet scarf and 
feather, oh. 
Like a 
Venus bright she did appear, did ray charming, bloom-
ing, Sally, oh; 
She is the girl that I 
love dear, and the Flower of Macheralliea, 
oh. 
An Irish lad although I 
be, has neither wealth nor treasure, oh, 
But still I 
love my dearest dear, I 
love her beyond measure, oh. 
If I 
had all the wealth that is possessed by the great Tacher-
ray le, oh, 
I 
would give it to her that L 
love best; she's the Flower of 
Macheralliea, oh. 
I 
hope the time will surely come when we'll join hands togeth-
er, oh • 
It's then I'll take m,T,, darling home, in spite of wind and weath-
er, oh. 
And let them all say as they will, and let them all scold and 
rally,oh, 
For it's I 
shall take my darlinc, home, the Flower of Macheral-
, •

BUFFALO. 
nom 
Buffalo I've just come down 
On the good boat Danger; 
A 
long, long trip on the Erie, boys, 
I 
feel just like a 
stranger. 
We'd heavy fogs, aaf wlnud storms, 
Forget 'em I 
never shall; 
I'm every incn a 
sailor boy, 
On the E-ri-a Canal. 
Cu 
onus. 
For the Erie is a 
thing, 
And the gin is getting low; 
I 
haidly think you'll get a 
drink, 
Till we go back to Buffalo. 
We were loaded down with barley, 
When we Lid good-bye; 
When a 
pirate Lc:c upon us, 
With an awful wicked eye. 
I 
saw him through the spy-glass, 
I 
put up a 
flag of truce; 
I 
found it was the Three Sisters, 
Four days from Syracuse. 
For the Erie, &o 
Three days' out we struck a 
rock, 
Of Lackawanna Coal; 
It save the boat an awful shock. 
And stove in quite a 
hole. 
I 
helloed to the driver, 
On the tow-path's tre,aden dirt; 
ge came aboard and stopped the leak, 
With his flannel undershirt. 
For the Erie, '
tr.. 
In two years we reached the Hudson, 
We hadn't slept a 
wink; 
The crew ruutinized 
Because I 
refused to:drink. 
Keep up your courage, then I 
cried, 
bri,...;.g you safely in; 
Ld w...en we strike a 
grocery store, 
Wt 11 swim in barrels of gin. 
For the Erie, Aro, 
The storm went down, we went ashore, 
Me and Sal and Hank; 
Greased ourselves with tallow-fat, 
And slid out on 
plank. 
Sal is in the Poor House, boys, 
The crew are all in jail; 
l'm the only sole surviving moke, 
Left to tell the tale. 
Spoi=. 
So haul in your bow-line, 
Stand by your sorrel mule, 
Low bridge, boys, dodge your heads s 
Don't act just like a 
fool.

HIGGINBOTTOM SISTERS. 
Written by ED. HARRIGAN. 
OH, the Higginbottom Sisters are here, 
We came from New Hampshire, 
We feel tarnation queer, 
Our bosoms arc wrapped in fire. 
We're descendants from the real oil stock, 
Who landed on Columbia's shore, 
ISVay down thar on Plymouth Rock. 
Where the waves and breakers roar. 
CHORUS. 
Oh! Iligginbottorn, 
We declare it's really shocking— 
There's no young fellow in the neighborhood 
• 
Will marry a 
Higginbottom. 
Oh, the world in its wicked ways, 
Has caused us many a 
pain; 
We don't want any praise, 
Or exaltation or fame. 
Our ancestors did shed their blood, 
In the revolutionary war; 
They perished like a 
flower in the bud, 
Oh, you might have heard it before. 
Oh, Higgiebottom, etc.

HOTEL DE VARSELAY. 
By En. HARRIGAN. 
Sung by all the Eastern-bound Irlarweys. 
I'm living at a 
boarding-house 
Up n 
Jouston street, 
Where actors and musicians 
Eat their meals and slew. 
There the hungry ballet tramp 
That come from Marcela, 
Dancing Danish polkas 
In the Hotel Varselay. 
CHORUS. 
All night I 
am uneasy, 
No sleep it all I 
get, 
Wid bones and clappers rattling 
And a 
Prussian clarionet. 
They never talk in English, 
But parley vous Francay, 
I'll lose my life, upon my soul, 
In the Hotel Varselay. 
When we sat down to breakfast, 
It's Cully, pass me that, 
Or Nix)- Weedy, Nibzy, 
Stag the tad wid the dizzy hat. 
They have a 
soup called bullion, 
The butter runs away, 
The boarders holler out for dates 
In the Hotel Varselay. 
All night I 
am, eta 
The other night I 
tried to sleep, 
When a 
man from Calumet 
Came down through the ceiling 
Turning a 
summerset. 
I 
grabbed him by his necktie, 
He " Hay Rubel hay Rube 1" did say, 
I 
was kicked by a 
circus company 
From the Hotel Varselay. 
All night I 
am, etc 
I 
went up stairs to get my trunks, 
And have revenge or die, 
When a 
man they called a 
tumbler 
Said, " Shoot him—kill the guy." 
I 
drew a 
knife and grabbed my trunk, 
The French said "Allecushay," 
My trunk was nailed unto the floor 
In the Hotel Vareslay. 
All night I 
am, etc 
PVE had my share of trouble, 
While rve been here below; 
By being kind o' foolish, 
Since I 
began to grow. 
thrcwed away my books, 
When I 
went to school; 
The teacher stood me on a

For the boys to call me fool.

De teacher cut rey hand with his awful big ratan, 
But be ain't a ,gwine to do so no more 
I 
used to go a 
fishing, 
Wid neediee, hooks and pin; 
Fish jerked me in do water, 
And den I 
couldn't swim. 
I

sponge cake, 
I

De doctor said they couldn't drowa. 
Such an awful foolish moke.

She went and got her brother Bill.

WE

And went away to the war, 
To De penetrated by cannon balls, 
And carry many a 
scar, 
When we went out we were so stout, 
Led on by Sergeant Quinn, 
We've come home all skin and bons, 
We'd drop if ye'd say fall in ; 
There's McClinchy and McGowan, 
McSwegan ani McFudd,

All men of royal blood,

Thin fall in for your castor oil, 
Before you go to bed, 
For if you're sick, the divil a

You'd make whenever you're dead; 
For every pill will surely kill, 
That they put in your jaw, 
If you lose a 
leg the devil a

You'd get in the Invalid corps. 
They give us soup mixed up wid mud, 
To try to get us well, 
And if we drank a 
drop of it,

We'd never live to tell. 
They give us bread that's always tread, 
Down under horses' feet, 
As a 
general rule it's army mules, 
They give to us for meat, 
With fever and ague and cholera-cramp, 
An' the barber's itch, • 
They'd throw us in an ambulance, 
Or else into a 
ditch, 
The eagle and crow, and buzzard you know, 
Fly down an' give us the claw, 
They'd eat us up, till a

Is left of the Invalid corps. 
Thin fall in for your castor oil, etc. 
Napoleon was a 
soger, 
And the Duke of Wellington, too, 
A 
hundred thousand million men, 
All in the war they slew; 
They never left a 
cripple, 
Whenever they fought the Dutch, 
They'd cut off their heads when they shoot 'em dead, 
So they never would need a 
crutch. 
But 'over here when you lose an ear, 
They order you behind, 
And the pension that they give to you, 
Is an Italian organ to grind; 
To sit out on the corner, 
An' play, Willie come home from the war, 
Thc divel a

You'll get in the Invalid corps. •

We're the boys dressed in blue, we- stand forninst you,

Out in the far west where the sun goes to rest, 
Sent by the government the injins to fight. 
The man with two horses and big Sitting Bull, 
Nez Perces and Sioux, the woods they are full, 
They skip it away over to Canada 
After they cut down the army, oh I

In Arizona the blue U. S. A. 
Drive us away—what do you say ? 
The Injun will cut down the army, oh I

pickle and bean, 
We've waited and waited and watched for poor Lo, 
The barber so red that Ind shave off your head, 
Till never a

Then skip it away over to Canada 
After:he cut down the army, oh! 
But Congressmen, etc. 
There's Joseph the chief, ho stole all our beef, 
An' horses an' wagons an' blankets an' clothes,

Fixin' the date for the hair of your head to grow.

But ' tis only to meet thee, like a

With the sunbeam it loved, then heart-broken to die.

Yet now ' twould be pleasant to meet with a

To show you were laughing and loving the while. 
Oh, let me not lose all my dreams of the past, 
The hope of the future, where joy, too, i3 cast; 
Let thy love be my lamp, and 
worship its light, 
Till the heart that's illumed be hushed in dark night.

On ! fancy brings a 
thought to me 
Of flowers sweet and rare, 
With grace and beauty there combined, 
And brightest hues so fair— 
So like a 
maiden that I 
loved— 
It was my happy lot: 
I 
whispered when we parted last— 
" 
Oh I 
you'll forget me not 1" 
CHORUS. 
Graceful and as charming as a 
lily in the pond 
Time has passed so swiftly—for, of her I 
am so fond— 
Dasies and the roses, too, they grow around the spot 
Where we parted and I 
whispered— 
" 
You:il forget me not! " 
We met—r 
really don't know where— 
But still ' tis all the same— 
For love walks in the busy streets 
As well as in the lane: 
I 
gently pressed her tiny hand: 
She glanced at me a 
shot— 
She dropped a 
flower, I 
picked it up— 
A sweet forget-me-not I
. 
(Chorus and Dance.) 
At last there came a 
happy day 
And somethim, that I 
said 
Just caused her lips to murmur ' yes I" 
And shortly we were wed. 
A 
little cottage by the brook, 
And a 
tiny garden spot 
Where grows a 
little flower called— 
A sweet forget-me-not!

With a

She fell on the ground and bounced out of town, 
The gal with the big rubber bustle.

mate be got for me, 
That I 
might be settled in life. 
I 
met with a 
young girl stopping there, 
her eyes were dark, her complexion fair, 
And with such a 
nice beautiful crop of hair, 
That I 
wished she could be my wife. 
She played tink-a-tink on an old guitar. 
Tra la lal, la la, tra, la lal, la la, 
I 
asked her with me for a 
stroll to go, 
And my love I 
would tell to her. 
She was an Italian from the land, 
Where Julius Cmsar, once held command, 
And that now supplies every peanut stand, 
A 
foreigner dark was she. 
She told me her pedigree to believe, 
They were lords and dukes before Adam and Eve 
Did ever the breath of their live receive, 
And that clearly she loved me. 
She played tink-a-tink, itc; 
In liquid tones sweet s 
Deautiful pea, 
&13 told of 112,r : o.n: td.33 anpag the girls, 
And shook in icy face her jet black curl 
The world s3aned to me bright. 
I 
said Fa give her my manly heart, 
That the end ot Lie should alone us part, 
She struck me so Lard with young Cupid's da4 
I 
thought I'd elooe that night. 
She played tink-a-tiuk, 
When home in New York. I 
went out to shop, 
To hear a 
street band I 
did make a 
stop, 
She was grinding thus, with a 
monkey on top, 
The dream of my life was over. 
She saw me start, she heaved a 
sigh, 
She knew her chance was gone up sky high, 
And the nasty monkey he winked his eye, 
thinl; he'd been there before. 
No more I'll be caught with an old guitar, 
Tra in Ink la la, trala lal 
From her sight I 
always keep me afar, 
She shall never make claim to me. 
White folks, your attention, 
We'll sing to you a 
song, 
'Tis about the black artillery, 
And we won't detain you long. 
You've heard them sing of the Mulligans, 
And the shaugnessy, so gay. 
We beat them on the dress parade, 
That's what the people say. 
CHORUS. 
We are the black artillery; 
The bosses of all, you bet. 
The ladies smile, enjoy our style, 
And say we are their pets. 
My name it is Anson, 
I 
am the general of the band 
This is private Smithers, 
He's under my command. 
We are the bravest Soldiers 
That ever went to war. 
We've fought four hundred battles 
And we're fit for forty more. 
We are the black, etc. 
One night I 
was kindly invited 
To take a 
fair girl to a 
show, 
And with it I 
was so delighted, 
That I 
quite forgot my dear Jo. 
Until I 
beheld my fair damsel. 
On whom I 
had spent so much time, 
A 
winking and flirting like fury 
With the clown of the pantomime. 
It made me so wild and uneasy, 
That I 
did not dare to turn ' round, 
For fear that I'd see my dear Josey 
A 
winking at the pantomime clown. 
The clown would make funny faces, 
Then heels over head he would go; 
And throw himself down by the footlights, 
Then smile and look over at Jo. 
Oh, then, how I 
wished I 
was near him, 
I'd punch off the half of his crown; 
For I 
couldn't bear to see Josey 
In love with a 
pantomime clown. 
Next day I 
went to call on her, 
But Josey wasn't to be found; 
Her mother she sobbed as she told me— 
She'd run off with a 
pantomime clown.

CAPTAIN CUFF. 
As sung by Wm. SCANLAN, with great success. 
Some folks go in for whiskey, 
Some for most unpleasant dogs; 
Some fellows have a 
fancy 
For the most outrageous togs. 
I'm very gone on linen, yes, 
And wouldn't give a 
dollar 
For life, without a 
splendid show 
Of snow-white cuff and collar. 
SPOKEN.—Yes, ladies and gentleman, for my great desire for 
linen, I 
have achieved the great and glorious title of — 
CHORUS. 
Captain Cuff! Captain Cuff 
You can tell me by my collar; 
Captain Cuff, Captain Cuff, 
Though I'm not worth one half dollar ; 
I'm awfully stiff in style, 
My cigarette I'll puff; 
Then hi I 
hi I 
clear the way, 
Here comes Captain Cuff. 
Sometimes a 
common fellow 
Of the lower order class, 
Will dare make some rude remark, 
Or mock me when I 
pass. 
And lots of vulgar little boys, 
They know me well enough, 
And oft salute me as I 
pass, 
With what cheer, Captain Cuff. 
With darling eyes upon mc, 
Through life I 
gaily march. 
My style shall be the stiffest; 
My motto shall be starch. 
Should my cuff and collar glory, 
Be ever gone and fled, 
You'll know that Captain Cuff's gone wrong, 
And his washerwoman's dead. 
Captain Cuff, etc.

DIP, DIP, 
Composed by J. H. MACK for J. 
W . 
MORTON, of the "BIG 
Fourt." 
While rowing on the lake one night. 
I 
heard the splash of oars, 
And seeing a 
lady gliding by, 
I 
rowed my boat to hers; 
The spray's sweet sound, as we wont on 
Bewitching coal- black eyes, 
Enchanting scenes 1'11 ne'er forget, 
Beneath the starry sky. 
CHORUS. 
Dip, dip, our oars we bent, 
Until the boats closed tight, 
Leaning over on one side. 
Kissing in the moonlight. 
(Repeat.) . 
" 
Oh, sir," said she, " you're impolite, 
An advantage to take like this 
In following me out on the lake, 
You've surely went amiss;" 
And then a 
smile so very sweet, 
tole o'er her pretty face, 
Then leaning to her oars again, 
Said for another race. 
Dip, dip, ke. 
The moon's bright rays shone on the lake, 
It was eternal bliss, 
I 
believed the words that I 
had heard— 
There is magic in a 
kiss. 
Like flying birds our boats sped on, 
I 
rowed with all my might, 
To gain the shore in time to help 
My darling to alight.

Don't Forget to be Kind to the Boys. 
Written expressly for LITTLE BOB by BEN DODGE. 
There is something which I 
wish to mention to you, 
While trying to please with my song. 
Some solid advice unto you I 
will give; 
Please listen its not very long. 
Yonr attention I'll call to the poor little boys 
Von will meet on the street every day. 
Do not spurn them aside with a 
curse or a 
kick, 
When by chance they are thrown in your way. 
CHORUS. 
Don't think they're too small to be noticed at 
Let them share in your sorrows and joys. 
Their love will repay your kindness some day, 
Don't forget to be kind to the boys. 
If a 
poor boy accosts you while trying to earn; 
By honest means but half a 
dime, 
If you have it to spare, buy a 
paper at once, 
(Jr invest when he proffers a 
shine. 
lie has loved ones at borne who upon him depend, 
For the poor crusts of bread which they eat; 
A 
lid the brave honest boy to provide them with food, 
Has to labor each day in the street. 
Don't think they're too small, &c. 
The greatest of statesmen were once small like me, 
And no one can tell what's in store 
For a 
boy in the future if upright he proves, 
No matter if now he is poor. 
So unheeded don't pass the advice which I 
give: 
1;u1 by your applause let me see, 
',Hat you promise to ever be kind to the boys, 
And I 
hope you'll begin here with me. 
ClIORUS 
Don't think I'm too small to be noticed at all, 
But kindly give me our applause. 
My love will repay your kindness some day.

LITTLE RUBY. 
Words by nOBT. W ORDEN. 
Music by ALBERT W EBIL 
Sung with success by W ORDEN & MACK at Tony Pastor's 
Theatre, N. Y. 
I'm over head and heels in love, 
With a 
darling, charming, pretty octoroon, 
Who swears by all the stars above, 
That I 
to church shall lead her soon. 
And oft at night when stars shine bright, 
And the silver moon in beauty shines above, 
We meet and walk, with happy talk, 
In all the pretty innocence of love. 
CHORUS. 
She's my little ruby (
break) 
And really quite a 
beauty, 
Then come with me at sunset to the valley, 
For there at twilight is our trysting tree, 
And there I 
meet the girl I 
hope to marry; 
I'm sure that you folks must envy me. 
Of course she's lots of followers, 
That seek her young affections to engage, 
She knows their hearts are hallower 
Than mine, although she's all the rage. 
Iler pretty feet are small and neat, 
And then her waltzing is really quite divine. 
Her eyes shine bright like stars at night, 
Quite melt me with their brilliant dreamy shine,

George Barnwell, THE MERCHANT'S CLEM:C.—This is an 
extremely sensational sketch, but shows Truth stranger than Fiction. 
This deluded victim went from crime to crime with a 
fearful rapidity, 
urged by the baneful influences of women lost to honor. He realized 
every moment the evils of his course, but, like a 
bird fluttering over the 
basilisk eye of the serpent, he went down, down, into the vortex of ruin 
and despair. 
This book teaches, in the strongest way, the moral lesson 
of resisting that temptation, which comes arrayed like an " angel of 
light"--beautiful to the eye, and blasting to the 80v2 
.
