Here i
s a copy of my rough notes from Samoa,  as requested.
 Let
 
me know if you need deciphering!
 
A
lso,  the photos are duplicates,  and I thought they might bring
 
back n
ice memories.
 
Hank says you're worried about me.
 Don't be!  (although  I
 
appreciate the concern).
 A couple of days at home have gone a
 
long way to helping restore balance.
 
M
ood to see you,  as a
lways.

After it was all  over  I heard some grumbi
 
superior-position  types  (like Brownie,  who wasn' t there
 
about the political  aspects of  the Festival.
.  It' s true,
 
Aboriginals capitalized upon  their position as hosts to u
 
attention  to their own  regretable position  in Australia.
 
Festival did coincide with black-power developments
 
downunder--such as a scathing UN Human Rights Commission
 
report on Aboriginal  conditions there and a Hawke gov' t
 
attempt to set things a bit more to rights.
.  I did note sc
 
(American)  dejavulike aspects of  racism in Queensland
 wh
 
made me feel  more solidarity with the Aboriginal  posit
 
thought the organizers did a good job and utilized  ths
 
occasion of hosting  the Festival  admirably in favor 01
 
cause without seriously detracting  from the fiafiaga a;
 
of  the event as a regional  (1/3 of  the earth' s surface)
 
celebration.  More power to them.  This is all grist for
 
long  talk,  not a letter.  If  I can  find  th
 
an article about it.  At  least  I ought to.
.
 
I' ve been over to visit Caroline in Weste
;:
 
times since my return.  Her fieldwork  is going extreme i
.
 
well.  Last weekend  I was over there with her in a sma1
 
village up in  the interior mountains of Upolu to help h-
record--video,  sound  tape,  and  photograph--village
 
performances.  She is getting some terrific material.  The
 
village folk  know what they' ve got and what is good,  ann
 
attentiveness has added value to their already strong sen:
.
 
of  pride in their performances.
.  (One hit on it--the wester
 
missionary overlay has been basically serious and sobering :
 
C comes in asking for what' s funny,  satiric
 comical,  and
 
the villagers are more than happy to peel  back  the dour an.
 
be themselves.  We had a lot of good  laughs over the
 
weekend.)  The village she is living  in now is a tiny,  selt
 
contained agricultural  community--one church,  one store  (;
 
the other side of  the river where the bridge has washed
 
and not been  replaced),  no motorized vehicles
 maybe 30'
 
people in  twenty-some homesteads in a beautiful  hanging
 
valley.  We recorded the several-hour  long performance oi  L
 
village women' s komiti Friday night.  On Sunday night they
 
came and asked to watch the video.  We borrowed  the pastror
 
color tv set  (the only one in  the village)  and showed  th'
 
the tape.  The entire village was there in  the open-sideu
 
fono fale and whooped  it up,  watching  their wives and
 
mothers and aunties and cousins cutting  it up with song-
ices and comic skits on  the tv.  Nielsen  r

TERRITORY OF AMERICAN SAMO
 
POST  OFFICE  BOX  1540,  PAGO PAGO,  AMERICAN
 
26 May 1988
 
Bess Lomax Hawes
 
Director,  Folk Arts Program
 
National Endowment for the Arts
 
Washington,  D.C.  20506
 
Dear Bess,
 
ECU TI VE  DI R
 
Thanks for yours of the 3rd and the copy of Folklife
 
Center News.  Actually,  I' m already on their mailing
 
list,  but it is good to have an extra copy of this one
 
as I'd already given my copy away.
 
Things here are going well.  Every month I seem to be
 
busier.  The local funding scene is frustrating.  We are
 
holding bake sales,  throwing donation drives,  running
 
bingo games,  and begging about the local business com-
munity to try and raise enough money to send our per-
formers to Townsville for the Festival of Pacific Arts.
 
It looks like some of us will get there anyway.  The
 
Australian government sure does seem to be making it as
 
difficult as possible to participate.
 
Caroline is back in the archipelago,  over in Upolu now,
 
doing her fieldwork. Nice having her in the general
 
area.  She was awarded both a Fulbright Fellowship and a
 
Ford Foundation grant for her doctoral research.  Wait,
 
I'll enclose a copy of a recent interview with her in
 
the News.  She's doing very well.
 
John & Dotsie are fine.  They'll be heading up to Hilo
 
soon,  where John will be directing a production of one
 
of his larger plays.
 
Will I see you in Logan in a couple of weeks? As of
 
this week I plan on being there.  It will be good to
 
chat.  Till then,  all my best.
 
Yours

Bess:
 
I don '
t have much more t
o r
1eport about t
hat transpired in D.C. during
 
NASAP
L.  It took me a coup
 of casual converstaions with Tile to get
 
any feeling at all abouti' w
ent on. Tile was sorry that she didn't get
 
to see you. She said she was exhausted the entire t
ime there and just
 
attended the sessions she had to, then returned to her roan.
 
As far as the CPAC meeting and why you weren't invited I got no sense
 
at all. Tile seemed completely blank on the subject. It may truly
 
have been a case of stupid oversight. She did acknowledge that Merrie
 
Carol was unnecessarily uptight about you and R
cxnalyn, and that she
 
(
Tile) would dicuss M2 '
s attitude with her. I hinted it may be more
 
than a mere correction of attitude problem. Tile observed that as far
 
as she knew both Saipan and Guam appreciated you and your visits.
 
When I mentioned that you were reconsidering your April visit here
 
because it coincided with the CPAC Poard and
 s visit, she asked me
 
to  redouble our invitation. I do so. She saw no problem with your
 
s
imultaneous presence here.
 
On another r
r tter, we have not yet received notification of our FY90
 
h  
sic FAC grant award. My FY90 begin
 January 1
. When you told me
 
that my first Master/Apprentice grai
 had not been approved you did
 
say the basic FAC grant was ok. Should I be worrying about my next
 
month's paychecks?
 
One other thing: can your office direct me to a funding source for
 
having oral history recordings transcribed? I have the perfect person
 
here to do the transcriptions, I just have to find the money to pay
 
her.
 
ll, a mixed bag of news and quandries. I am sending a copy of the
 
half-hour Artists in America t
.v. show, about Mary Pritchard along in
 
a day or to in support of her National Heritage Fellowship nomination,
 
I am having slides of her work copied, and they will follow soon.

As I

One day s

I

 s

That

The Pacific a

resented an a

t

s unequalled among t

a
reas.  (One-third o

t was t
he f

hed l

he o
rigins
 
o
f l
anguage and culture, t
he nature of c
ivilization, and t
he r
elation between human cultures
 
and t
he physical world.  Europeans' conceptions of t
heir own cultural p
ractices, s
ocial
 
i
dentity, and h
istorical development were questioned and c
larified i
n r
elation t
o t
heir s
har-
pening images and i
ncreasing knowledge of Pacific I
s
landers.  I
n popular European t
hought,
 
i
f l
ess consistently i
n s
cientific t
hought, Pacific I
s
landers r
epresented a
 d
ramatically d
if-
f
erent o
rder of existence.  The d
ifferences were defined variously i
n t
erms of h
istorical
 
metaphors (
comparisons drawn between i
dyllic i
s
land cultures and notions of c
lassical Euro-
pean antiquity), r
eligious dogma (
ignorance and evil a
ligned against enlightenment and
 
God), evolutionary s
chema (
Pacific I
s
landers a
s part o
f a
 Great Chain o
f Being culminating
 
i
n Western European c
ivilization), o
r f
anciful notions about an "
antipodal i

rom t

I
n t
his way, t
he Western v
iew o

ramed f
rom e

encounters a

enerated f
rom European values and philosophical i
nter-
e
sts t

dentities.  The s
elf-
r
eflective a
spect i

s undeniably p
resent i
n any
 
people's encounter with cultural s
trangers, yet i
n t
he c
ase of t
he European appreciation o
f
 
t
he Pacific, i
t has been unusually p
rominent and enduring.  Ethnographic writing on t
he
 
P
acific, f
rom t
he e
arly twentieth c
entury t
o t
he p
resent, has continued t
his concern with
 
r
eflecting notions of a
 Western s
elf against a
 contrasting I
s
lander imago.  Hence Margaret
 
Mead was upholding t
his i
ntellectual t
radition when s

Indeed, Mead's s
ubtitle makes c

s
ions o

his i
ntellectual debate a
re Freeman's (
1983) r
econsiderations of Mead's v

s concerned l

t
han with r
eflecting a
 particular v

he example of Samoa (
cf.
 
Acciaioli 1

I
f a
cademically d
isciplined Western writing about t
he Pacific has been preoccupied
 
with s
elf-reflective analysis, t
his f
ascination has been even more persistent i
n popular
 
Western images of t

L
ack cf  institutional support for culture and the
 
,
orts
o inly o c  (rather western)  symptom of the situation
 
L
ooking at.  Two recent instances involving
 
a
1checlogical '
:ites on Tutuila are informative.
 
L
low
, archeology is not an art;  it is a science,  and it
 
.
Jefinetly nut a traditional Samoan concern--beyond an
 
interest
,  in  family burial sites.  But from a western, point of
 
view  ii.
 Is a science that can be a valuable tool  in
 
0  '
jerstanding t
;he  history and evolution of a people by
 
:
:;ipLy r
i
 information about that people's past that was not
 
c
arriol  forward  in their oral,  material,  or performance
 
t aditions.  It can supply evidence that enhances cultural
 
identity;  it  is a connection  (albeit at times abstract and
 
e
. oteric)  to tue ancestors.  (But then,  what exactly do
 
a
iice tors  have to do with culture?)
 
The
 
two s
 
tes  in question are adze quarry sites in the
 
v liages of Leone and Fagasa.  They are of extreme importance
 
to archeologists,  as the discovery of these two quarries--
8
 
the most extensive  in all of Samoa--has thrown light upon
 
Tutujla s position  in pre-European-contact Polynesia.  The
 
eider
i e i
ndicates that the island was in all probability a
 
major supplier of stone tools to much of western Polynesia
 
a
:-i
d Melanesia.  i
S
'
utuilan stone implements from these quarries
 
nave been found as far '
iway as the Solomon Islands. This
 
i
nformation ad:s new importance to the historical self-image
 
o
r
' Tutui la,  which in tL  predominant view of Samoan oral
 
n
:story was primarily an island for political exiles.
 
ec ntly,
 a eon toriersy has arisen over roads being cut
 
tnrou b
 r
iese two sites. On one side of the controversy are
 
T H
s e
 interesttd in Samoan prehistory and the conservation
 
o
r  cultural artifacts and monuments. On the other side are
 
those concerned more with the rights of property and freedom
 
fun regulator
 agencies. Or,  one might say,  the controversy
 
is  b
etween the interests of preservation and the interests
 
progress--it. ofar as road construction can be considered
 
pro gre ss.
 
U
ric cf  tb-  more interesting aspects of this controversy
 
-ha-
,
 c i
nighc be construed as a seeming reversal of
 
t
raditional colonial roles.  It seems to be largely Samoans
 
a
ogui
.ng
 or the roads and the accompanying destruction of
 
hrstoriially meaningful sites,  and white Americans arguing
 
ur cfta:Ls for cultural conservation.  Those familiar with
 
r
n
 L
iar ry of America's dealings with indigenous peoples
 
might be surprised by this alignment.  Within the past
 
several years,  for instance,  major court battles have been
 
waged  by  the Yurok Indians in the Pacific Northwest and by
 
n
 
tive  R waiians  against just the type of road-cutting
 
Jestruct
on  of  traditional lands and sites that the
 
_rlmarlly Samoan i
nterests in these instances are arguing
 
Of course the controversy is nowhere near so simple.
 
There is a sort of  '
town/gown'  dichotomy of local interests
 
V a.
 outside academic experts.  So,  a few off-island Ph.D
 
typen  ha v e  c o m e  here,  poked around on other people's
 
o
 per' y
 piok i up  pie--es  of stone and taken them back to
 
wnerever they 'd come from;  and then they wrote reports that
 
were  read  only by a hanifull of other palagi eggheads.  What
 
roes  tnat  have  to do  with our getting on with life and
 
development here on Tutuila?
 
Another aspect of this controversy is the conflict
 
between regulatory agencies and land owners,  a conflict fed
 
by the  intense emotions that always accompany questions of
 
laral
 nd  property  rights in Samoa.  The American Samoan
 
( vernr,ert  has  adopted American-style regulations that
 
r
gn ze sites of  particular historic importance as having
 
ertr T
h rights,  i
n so far as they belong,  in a sense,  to all
 
3 moans and no  merely to those on whose land they happen
 
n w to be located.  But rhose regulations must be enforced to
 
he  meaningful,  and the people charged with that enforcement
 
are most often people from some downtown agency,  not a local
 
chief.
 
My feeling is that the majority of Samoans really
 
roulon  t care less about the archeological evidence of their
 
or'history or even about their prehistory itself.  It is not
 
act:ve  part of their cultural  identity.  Samoans--like
 
p
ople---i ' e  i
n th  present,  and what is past is past--
except where their own family's titles and lands are
 
concerned
 
The
e  frust ations of the cultural conservationist that
 
I nave
 en discussing are ultimately the result of the
 
a
ttempt to establish an institutional Samoan identity. They
 
a
rise from false or unshared expectations,  from an improper
 
projection of values,  and from confusion over what
 
i'
r
s t l tLJ t e s
 a
 ulture or a cultural identity.  What I have
 
been
 r
o u
s i n
g
 about are the failures to establish the power
 
p into  of such
 n  institutional  identity--a museum,  a
 
iit
oH  cente ,  a n
eanLngful historic preservation program.
 
but  to what ex.ent,  really,  is this institutionalized
 
cu tural identity representative of the actual Samoan
 
oultural  i
dentity? And  io what extent do the frustrations
 
arise  fr:m native Samoans rather naturally resisting these
 
well-intentioned attempts to enroll their fa'asainoa into--in
 
arcuse
 phrase-- the administered world'?
 
na ppen
 ,
o think That it is essential at this
 
:reoarious point in time for every effort to be made to
 
ostabli';f
l an  i
rstitutional Samoan  identity.  The generation
 
of  young American Samoans even now entering adulthood need
 
soch a r fereni e point
 n order to make sense of their own
 
i
c
ientity and maintain a healthfully evolving Samoan cultural
 
But  those of us engaged  in such an  endeavor must
 
1
1
 
oogni
 that what we are doing is  introducing this concept
 
of ' cultural conservation'  into a vigorous  indigenous
 
sLciety that has never before  isolated the concept of
 
conservation  from the actuality of being alive  in a
 
rntinuous wor d,  a society that remains admirably adverse
 
outside regulations while rap-idly internalizing a host of
 
rt jd
 influe: ces.  How  long can one enjoy motorcars before
 
i
r g speed  limits ,
'
 
Lo  the final analysis,  the rhetoric  is all
 
i
:stitut  onal  rhetoric  which is sometimes thrown back,  and
 
the reality is  that culture,  as always,  (whatever it is or
 
may be becoming)  muddles on.

Dear Bess:
 
Happy Mothers Day.  (Somehow that seems appropriate. )
 
Enclosed are a new publication by our local wr it ers  group,
 
Three Tutuila Poets, and a recent paper prepared for the
 
Pacific Arts Association that I thought y o u  might f
ind
 
interesting.
 
Things here with the folk arts program were going swimmingly
 
until recently.  I have five master/apprentice teams working
 
i
n Ofu, where we will all be presenting a summer folk arts
 
workshop.  (Ofu is one of the tiny Manu'a islands,  and the
 
people there have been particularly gracious and welcoming
 
to the program.  I feel at home there when I visit and have
 
very good feelings for the future of our activities there.
 
You know that feeling--hey,  this is working,  it's taking on
 
a life of its own,  its become their project not mine.
 
Other projects--not directly related to my job
 
description--have also moved forward. A plan I put togetii-r
 
to counter a local gov t plan to turn the park area adjacent
.
 
to the museum into a parking lot won approval from the
 
planning board and the governor, and now I am trying to find
 
funding (the gov't offered none) to develop the park into
 
performance venue. Our national park creeps closer to
 
reality (there is a tie-in here with the Ofu project,  as
 
part of the park will be located on Ofu,  and I am working
 
with the NPS people on how our programs can best i
nteract).
 
We had a pretty busy apr i
r
ig.
 
My boy Liam is now two-and-a--half and the central l
ay and
 
entertainment of my life.  I don't know if you know but
 
Sinavaiana and I separated a year and a half ago.  She is
 
still working at completing her dissertation on faleaitu. 
But there is a downside, and the rest of this letter is
 
confidential.  (Why is it downsides are so often
 
confidential?) The enclosed paper on "Rhetoric and Reality:
 
The Frustrations of Cultural Conservation in American Samoa,
 
A Case Study"  is a sanitized look into the gray area. But
 
recently things have taken a more ominous turn. The American
 
Samoa Government (ASG) recently typified itself as having  '
a
 
cash flow crisis'  (there is no Chapter 11 for governments).
 
All ASG employees were reduced to 90% working hours and 90%
 
pay,  including yours truely, even though my salary is paid
 
through your NEA grant. What's worse is that the ASG
 
Disbursement Office temporarily shut its doors--meaning no
 
checks for contractors. My master craft people are paid as
 
contractors through the Disbursement Office. They have
 
occasionally opened their doors since and passed out some
 
checks, but for almost a month now I have not been able to
 
get my people paid. Just as things were beginning to run
 
smoothly. My masters continue to instruct and submit their
 
i
nvoice hours,  hoping I will be able to spring their checks
 
sooner or later, and I sincerely hope that my badgering will
 
succeed. But it is causing a morale problem.  (All my out-of-
pocket expenses for supplies, photographic expenses,  etc.,
 
have likewise not been reimbursed.  It seems that Folk Arts
 
s pretty far down their list of priorities.
 
Usually I wouldn't bug you or go into such deat U about such
 
things. ASG has had such periods off and on throughout the
 
decade I
've been here,  except this time it seems especially
 
severe and banana-republicish--and it affects my people  n
:
1
 
my  program. And I am frustrated, approaching bureaucratic
 
burnout, and a little scared for the future of all I
've b
een
 
working at and care for.
 
Specifically:
 
Tile Lolotai is retiring before the end of the fiscal year.
 
Her husband died last year, and without Al here there really
 
is no personal reason for her to remain in Samoa. Most of
 
her children and grandchildren are in Hawaii,  and she will
 
be returning there.  In fact,  over the past few months she
 
has been turning more of the E
.D.  stuff over to me to do,  at
 
last the correspondence parts. That's ok;  it's not that
 
onerous. But yesterday I received a very specific warning
 
from a source on the inside of such things that Palauni
 
(Brownie) Tuiasosopo is making a very strong play to return
 
to the Arts Council in Tile's position,  and that he does n
it
 
want me around when he does so. The current governor is th--
same man that Brownie worked his negative magic at the Arts
 
Council under before. He might just be able to get back in.
 
(As I try to subtly point out in the paper, the ASG
 
administration and this governor [mildly senile] are not
 
exactly friends of the arts.) Brownie and I have never been
 
close,  though always polite. He is the major administrator i
 
refer to in my paper about making off with the museum
 
collection
 
For instance,  I have no legal proof of this,  but
 
enough circumstantial testimony to get an indictment if I
 
were a D
.A., but remember that $170,000 film fiasco from the
 
'
84 Festival of Pacific Arts in Tahiti? Your son wrote me
 
and asked me to cheek if any of the footage we have here--
the American Samoan Arts Council was delegated as repository
 
of the totally uncut film at the conclusion of all the
 
bitter rangling--was his,  as he has no idea where the
 
footage he shot ended up. The film had arrived here and had
 
been deposited in the museum's air-conditioned storeroom for
 
safe keeping. But when I went to check it out for your son's
 
footage,  it was gone. The curator claimed total ignorance of
 
the film's existence. Everyone's acting wholly dumb about i
t
 
keyed me. During Brownie's fraud-abbreviated stint as
 
Director General of the South Pacific Commission, carton-
l
oads of the museum's collection were surreptitiously
 
shipped to him in Noumea to be distributed as his gifts.
 
Since (and before) then he has appropriated even more of the
 
3
 
'
'ullection 'on loan" for different purposes. A few days work
 
on the jungle telegraph brought forth testimony that Brownie
 
had bragged about having "a copy" of the film. There are no
 
copies of the 16-mm uncut footage, just the missing
 
i
riginal. After presenting all this to Tile,  I finally got
 
her to report the missing film as a theft to the police; but
 
of course there was no follow-up, no investigation. Brownie
 
knew within two days that I was the one tyring to find a
 
whistle to blow and he holds that against me. He had started
 
attacking me two years before after I was quoted in Time 
unfavorably comparing the cultural health of American Sairoa
 
wiLh Western Samoa.
 
.
J have trouble understanding everyone else's thrall of
 
Brownie. The rest of the Arts Council staff would rather
 
j
ust forget about all the stuff he's stolen,  though they
 
claim they would quit if he became E
.D. He is universally
 
disliked but tolerated at the Community College where for
 
the past several years he has been collecting a Director s
 
salary (that of two badly needed teachers) for doing nothing
 
as an Instituitional Planner. Everyone will talk about his
 
abuses, but no one will do anything.  (
If you don't know
 
about his totally embarrassing--not to mention criminal--
activities while head of the SPC, where he was fired mid-
term for flagrant fraud, ask me.)
 
Of course,  he is right.
 
I couldn't and wouldn't work for him. He's a realist. Crooks
 
tend to be. And I can find other work to feed Liam and
 
myself.  It's just that it is such a critical time for my
 
our) programs--the Folk Arts Fiafia up and running (through
 
its second successful year and beginning to become
 
traditional),  the Master/Apprentice program taking off
 
(finally),  the museum performance park birthing,
 
publications beginning to flow--it really pisses me oft
' to
 
think that the keys will be turned over to Brownie, who will
 
run the whole thing into the ground again as he did before.
 
Being a pala i, I have no chance at the E
.D.  spot.  I will
 
approach Sinavaiana about opposing him for the position.  She
 
has much better credentials, but zero political clout after
 
being away for so long and generally withholding her tautua. 
I don't know if she'd want the job anyway.
 
1 am just now setting all the local things i
n motion I can
 
to try and stop him. Even if I am successful,  it will
 
probably cost me my job.  I just don't have the political
 
debth here to survive-in-tact taking on a Tuiasosopo.
 
(Remember, adult Caucasian males make up probably less than
 
one-half of one percent of our population.)
 
Beginning to sound a little melodramatic,  a
i
.n t
. he?
 
Beg (i n in g  to feel that way.
 
I don't know if I am asking tnr
 
your always welcome advise and assistance or just carping
 
from the trenches.  I do know I have to talk about this with
 
someone who grasps all the details and all the deeper
 
t
:on text.
 
"Dances with Ghosts" just ran through my head  l
ike
 
lights on a movie marquee.
 
J
ohn Kneubuhi,  the one person here I would usually turn to
 
to help me gnaw over such things,  is not here. He is up in
 
Honolulu, dying from the radiation treatments for his brain
 
'
.ncer.
 
If I seem to be l
osing on a lot of fronts,  at l
east
. Le
 
Vaomatua is going strong.  I enclose our recent newsletter.
 
But, no, even there,  in my current mood I would have to say
 
we are constantly losing ground too,  inspite of our minor
 
successes.  I
've just completed a quarter-million dollar
 
grant proposal to the MacArthur Foundation for regional co
 
assistance among environmental NGOs,  but it is probably too
 
little too late.
 
I go into look at Liam asleep,  this huge brown cherub (
I ll
 
throw in a picture of him as well), and that cheers me up.
 
Then I think of the dire greenhouse perdictions for these
 
islands and our population explosion here and the extensive
 
on-going degradation of the local environment,  and wonder
 
what further,  outer island of sanity I might take him to. At
 
l
east I can show him what I
've learned about planting taro
 
and making fish traps and how to make sennit and fix
 
breadfruit and make an umu. And he can teach me how to
 
dance.
 
Oh, Bess,  I feel like I am unburdening myself on you
 
unfairly. What kind of friend is it that writes only when
 
things are falling in on them?
 
It's a hot still night. The
 
trades hav0e yet to arrive--a month late, by local standards
 
another al
 omen.  (The ocean temp here three degrees F
 
higher than last year's,) Another storm year coming up.
 
But then, when it's still like this the bamboo doesn't whack
 
against the roof and awaken the boy who would then come to
 
me three-fourths asleep and say,  "Daddy,  I
'm scared.

Hope that all  is going well  with you.
 It was fun

 I
'm feeling rainy weather  in my soul  today,
 
missing friends like you,  struggling to adjust to motherhood
 
again,  single motherhood that is,  struggling to mairctain
 
some focus so that my work can proceed.
 It's a difficult
 
time,  but  I expected as much,  & I mostly ebb & flow with it.
 
speaking of wch,  I best flow on to town so I can post this
 
letter & finish ploughing through this heap of work on my

Leutogi  was married to the luitoga,  the king of  Ton ga.

much ti.me alone  in  the woods,  and when the king and his
 
tr
ends  planned  to hunt flying  foxes she would warn the bats
 
inorder  to spite her husband.  Thus,  the flying foxes came to
 
recognize the unhappy Leutogi  as  their  friend.
 
After  a time,  Leutogi  resolved to get rid of the child.
 
One day the wives went together  to their bathing place,  and
 
the  Tongan wife asked Leutogi  to hold  the child while she
 
hithed  first.  As soon as her  rival  was out of sight,  Leutogi
 
seized  the moment to kill  the  infant.  The Tongan wife,
 
hearing  the sudden wild cry of her  child,  returned,  but the
 
baby was already dead.  When the king heard of this evil
 
deed,  he became so angry that he ordered that Leutogi  be
 
burned  alive.
 
The Unlucky woman  was dragged by his men  into the bush
 
'
nc1  ueund  in  the  fork
:  -
D-F a fet u tree.  Soon a tall  heap  of
 
wood surrounded her.  Then  the people set fire to  it,
 
and,  not wishing  to hear Leutogi's screams,  they returned  to
 
the village.  But as soon  as  the flames began  to rise,
 
something  truly extraordinary took place---thousands  of
 
'f
lvinci  foxes came ' out of  the jungle and extinguished  the
 
ti
e  Oy urinating  on  it.
 
When  the king's attendents returned,  they found Leutogi
 
still  alive and  the fire out.  They were very surprised and
 
nurried back to tell  the king what had happened.  Next,
 
Tuitocia ordered  that Leutogi  be taken and abandoned on a
 
barren,  uninhabited  island.  This  island was haunted by a
 
demon  nam d Losi.  and  the king,  who knew this,  was certain
 
 
I
 
3
 
that Losi  would soon kill  Leutogi.  Losi,  however,  did not
 
touch her because he thought she would soon die for want of
 
cod  and water.  So he simply sat down to wait and watch her
 
die. 
r
-eat,  therefore,  was Losi  '
s surprise when the -next day
 
n o
 
saw a multitude of  flying foxes,  each bringing some kind
 
of  food  to Leutogi.  The bats continued  in this way to feed
 
her  for days as Losi  looked on,  amazed.
 
After some time,  the Fijian  Tuivaea happened  to sail
 
clo se to that  island.  Leutogi  called out to him and begged
 
him to take her  along with him.  This he did gladly,  and,
'  as
 
she was a very '
good  looking woman,  he married her and  in due
 
time she bore him a son  KH nry  1983;  F
'itisemanu n.d.).
 
I ye streamlined  the  legend a bit  in  this  tellin -
caving  out,  for  instance,  the three important chiefly title
 
names which have their  origin  in  the story.  But to a
 
S
 
tolklorist,  the narrative  is still  packed with significance,
 
necause  to the  train ed ear  the content of such stories  is
 
high ly suggestive of underlying beliefs,  social
 
understandings,  and historical  contexts.  We have here,  for
 
example,  two motifs  that are truly exceptional  in Polynesian
 
legend--a hero saved by urination and a hero saved by
 
airlifted food.
 
Investigators  in any discipline compile and study
 
masses  of  data,  looking  for  the patterns that are the field
 
context and  the exceptions  to those patterns  that offer  the
 
4
 
com municative content.  To a folklorist these two unique
 
Polynesian motifs signal  that something special  is happening
 
here.  And  the agent in both  instances  is the flying fox.
 
As  is not a folklore conference,  I will  not belabor you
 
with analytic procedures.  But in both motific  instances the
 
message is that flying foxes are indigenously associated
 
ith '
fertility/fecundity.  The second motif  is the more
 
obvious:  a barren,  uninhabitable,  demon-infested  island  is
 
made viable through the agency of flying foxes;  the monster
 
o  starvation  is defeated.  The first motif delves more
 
deep y
 ntc the erotic subconscious,  but it directly
 
associates  flying fo es with fertility and survival.  In a
 
fuller  version of the legend,  Leutogi,  still  tied  in the
 
fetau tree after  the bats have extinguished the fire,  says
 
to the luitoga's men words that live on as a Samoan proverb:
 
"Ua tatou fetala  i I le ma2afetau soifua" -
-
 "We meet under
 
the fet u tree while yet full  of life"  (Henry  1
983).
 
In  fact,  a simplistic version of this association of
 
the  f
lying fox with rain  lives on  in a Samoan children's
 
song still  sung
, today,  simil
ç  to our  American nursery
 
rhyme,  "aIn rain go away":
 
Le  a
 
le ae a
 e  amo tele  lau
 ave a
 
Aua ne l  timu se'i  matou eva.
 
l
ifitifi  e tac
il  ba  laofie.
 
 
I
 
5
 
Flying fox,  flying fox,  take your burden far away
 
Don t rain,  so we can play
 
Tifitifi, cry immediately the rain stops.
 
(Moyle  1988)
 
To a folklorist,  a further striking feature of this
 
egerd  is  its associations of  l
iminality.
 By liminality
 
her ,  we refer to a term coined and elaborated by
 
anthropologists Arnold Van Gennep and Victor  Turner to
 
descnibe the state of being  '
in-between'  categories,
 
mar
'qinai,  anomalous,  "neither fish nor  fowl".
 Leutogi,  for
 
example,  the He
.ro of-this tale,  is a liminal  person--a
 
samoan woman  i
n a Tongan: hQusehold,  which  incidentally,
 
reflects the reality of an historical  period when Sam oa was
 
to some extent subjugated by the neighboring  Tonga.
 She
 
befriends and  is befriended by a liminal  species,  the flying
 
fox_  which while mammalian  (and so able to urinate
 
effectively)  also flies,  unlike other mammals.  Such
 
cveclappir
,q cateqori
s of existence often occupy a unique
 
nc significant niche  in the worldview of  indigenous people
 
(Mary Douglas  1966).
 Often,  as  in the case of L
.eutogi  and
 
her bat-saviors,  liminality connotes a kind of supernatural
 
sanction exerting  its  influence on human affairs from some
 
o'
lym ian vantage point.  To the folklorist,  such  liminal
 
characters found  in traditional  lore signal  something
 
significant going on  in the cultural  belief system which
 
6
 
e pr-es es  itself  metaphor-i
 call y through  legend and
 
mythology .
 
Samoa  is  the eastern boundary of the flying fox 's
 
natural  habitat,  but strangely enough  it  is not the eastern
 
boundary of Polynesian  lore about giant bats.  Great,  often
 
man-eating,  bats are found  in Hawaiian,  Maori,  and Tuarnotuan
 
traditions  (Grace  1907;  Stimson  1937;  Beckwith  1940).
 
Hawaiian  legend even  includes an eight-eyed bet  (Thrum  1923;
 
Beckwith  1940).  It is  interesting that giant bat stories
 
persisted  in these flying-foxiess societies which had
 
evolved from western Polynésian cultures where flying foxes
 
had been prevelant.  Such: instances of marginal  motific
 
survival  are not uncommon
 
However.  it  is  in flying fox country,  western
 
Poivnes
--
amoa,  Tonga,  Niue,  Fiji,  and the outliers--where
 
t-i
e most  integrated  flying fox traditions are encountered.
 
We iind bats as gods  in -both Tikopian and  Tongan myths
 
(Oollocott  1921;  Gifford  1924),  and  in Fijian  lore a giant
 
hite vampire bat acts as a messenger  (Fison  1904).
 
In a rather complex Niuean narrative about a war
 
between the birds and the beasts,  we again encounter the
 
flying fox 's inherent liminality.  Here the bat's nocturnal
 
and
'
aloof habits are explained as a result of its being
 
scorned by both the birds and the beasts because '
during the
 
mythic war the flying fox played politics,  switching from'
 
side to side as  the fortunes of war waxed and waned,  dealing
 
7
 
s double nature  (Loeb  1
926).  And  in Tikopian  legend
 
e have the Polynesian prototype for Bruce Wayne,  a creature
 
wh
 is sometimes bat,  and other times man  (Firth  1961).
 
But what do such  local  legends and myths contribute to
 
our understanding of  the contemporary cultural  significance
 
of the flying fox'? A series of recent interviews with
 
Samoans  in Samoa revealed a continuity between traditional
 
and contemporary attitudes toward flying foxes.  Most
 
strikinq of  these is that flying foxes still  occupy a
 
liminal  position  in the Samoan view of nature.  While the pea
 
is  identified and appreciated as an integral  and highly
 
valued part of '
the t
t
'aditiónal  Samoan forest,  during fr ui t
 
nar
-vesting season they r
n y be viewed as pests as they
 
compete with farmers for the fruit crop.*
 Also,  while their
 
flesh  is still  prized as a
. delicacy,  it is not considered
 
"feast food"  and the selling of flying foxes  is almost
 
universally frowned upon.  I have never seen flying foxes for
 
sale in Samoa,  either  in the farmers'  markets or elsewhere.
 
The actions '
of  individuals  in recent years to harvest and
 
export Samoan flying foxes are commonly seen as criminal
 
activities.,  greedy and shameful  behavior.  The flying fox has
 
never been a staple of the Samoan diet.  Most often when i
,t
 
is  taken,  the one or two bats are offered to elders or other
 
ranking  family members as an  in-group delicacy gift.
 
Strikingly,  our survey revealed that the vas 
'
t majority
 
of Samoans questioned support recent efforts to protect the
 
ae a v o  (Pteropus Samoensis)  and ae'a
 faitau1a28 (Pteropus

(
kramer  1
902)  is still  told  and reveals  this ambivalence.
 
Also,  the most

the arrival  of  fire arms  indicates  a type of pest control
.

and  tne hunter  would  try to hook the bat,  tearing  its wings,

You k
now, t

or B

Tuiasosopo (
"
that o

im i
n your l
e
tter),
 
which i
s good, because I
 s
t
ill must deal w
ith t
he man a
lmost
 
c
onstantly.  When I

i
t across committee t
ables f
rom h
im I
 am
 
r
eminded o
f my motyher's r
emonstrance, "
Love t
he s
inner, hate t
he
 
s
in." But he can be a devious, self-sanctimonious f
art.  As w

is
 
a
ttempt t
