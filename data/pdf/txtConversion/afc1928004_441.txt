I

Dot veighs dree hundred bounds, 
It dook dree cents to feed her every year, 
She's got a

Und bites yust like a

You bet she make's a 
dinner disappear, 
Ouf vile opun der street a 
sausage man she meet 
She'd swallow up all der fellow had, 
0, der mustard it would tease her, 
Und de only ding to blease her, 
Vos to give her lager beer by der keg. 
CHORUS. 
She's a 
svill barrel, a 
hipopotirais, 
Und der biggest eater you ever seen, 
She can swallow a 
whale both head und tail, 
Such an appetite has got my Coterine. 
I 
dook her to a 
ball one night, 
Der moosic dot vos fine,

In der middle ouf der lanciers 
Coterine dook a

Yen I 
dook her to der table, 
To hold her I 
vosent able, 
For she made a 
break for der sour krout, 
0, she snittered like a 
heifer, und nevItr stopped, no 
never, 
'Till der ball vos done und der gas turned out. 
(Chorus.)

Half buried in der sewer found,

Dere in der sunlight, old und grsy, 
Sircharged mit lager beer he lay, 
Oh, sad vere der voices of der night, 
Dot rent der air mit—

Sailor Bold. 
Sung with great success by Miss MAY LODER, the great Vocal Electric 
Change Artist, 
My love is a 
sailor bold, 
And he shipped on a 
man-of-war, 
He sailed away on a 
bright summer's day, 
And I'll never see him no more. 
He's a 
reefing in the maintop sail 
And a 
hauling in the maintop gaff, 
Or a 
winding in the slack when the ship takes a 
tack, 
And the wind three sheets and a 
half. 
CHORUS. 
He sailed away with his heart so true, 
He sailed away with his shirt of blue, 
He sailed away with his gallant crew, 
He says I'll write, I'll write to you. 
(Sailor's Hornpipe.) 
He sailed to a 
foreign port, 
Where the monkeys and the cocoanuts grow, 
He wrote to me most every week, 
For he loved me well I 
know, 
He started on a 
homeward trip 
And he shipped an awful sea, 
But my sailor brave came home on a 
wave, 
With his heart still true to me. 
(Chorus.)

One evening lately I 
run out quickly 
To buy some fish for a 
Friday night; 
I 
went to Subelski's to buy some plunkeys, 
And what I 
saw there was a 
terrible sight. 
There was pike fish, pickerel, and plunkeys, 
And mackerel that had a 
terrible smell; 
A 
pound for two cents, three, or five cents, 
However they eat them I 
cannot tell. 
CHORUS. 
There's Subelski, the political speaker, 
In Tammany Hall, boys, he's got a 
pull 
I'll keep away from Subelski's fish store 
Friday noon, when the store is full. 
Subelski's daughter drinks Croton water, 
But she won't refuse a 
glass of beer; 
She is, like her father, a 
big wind bladder, 
And a 
crushed politician's beyond compare. 
He will run for Assembly or Congress 
On our coming election day; 
I'll put my vote in for Isaac Subelski, 
And he'll get elected to stay away.

Mit his eye-glasses up to his nose, 
Und yen I

How nice vas der &iv vot he throws, 
His hat it vas shine like a

He sting all my heart like a

I 
fall upside down right in love too, 
Und dot vellar he played sweet on me. 
Spoken.—Yar, he vas as sweet as a 
sugar-coated pill. 
Now he told me his parents vas wealthy, 
Und he vants me to run right away, 
lie ask me if I 
be his husband, 
Und den I 
don't know vat to say, 
He whisper he's love to destruction, 
Und den he falls down on his knees 
Und den he upset all my ideas, 
Dot vellar vot played sweet on me. 
Spoken. — He sold neek-ties on der corner of dem streets, 
(Chorus). 
Now I 
didn't keep company mit him 
Not over a 
couple of weeks, 
When lig takes me und dreats me to lager, 
Und nice vas der vords vot he speaks, 
He put out his arm right around so, 
Like dose " Romeo" lovers you see, 
Und he steal out my vatch und my diamonds, 
Und dots how he played sweet on me. 
(Chorus). 
Now I 
valks up and down by dem corners, 
But dot vellar I

My heart it is broken to beaces, 
I 
told you of dot once before, 
But I

For I 
kick myself right on his eyebrow, 
Dot vellar dot played sweet on me. 
Spoken. — Yar, he vas a

fraud hut

DINGELBENDER'S MULE.

Und for his broder dree miles off he loudly den vill bray; 
Dot vakes up all de horses den, und such an awful noise 
As dey vill make, 'twould drive you mad, but I'm vone of de

He ain't much of a

his rider, but de saddle itches his back, und he has a 
habit of 
going up alongside of a 
house, und rubbing a 
fellow's leg off, 
und dot ain't very pleasant. 
Dot's de reason I 
say— 
Of all de droubles, etc.

NAUGHTY DUTCH BUM. 
As sung by LARRY TOOLEY. 
Copyrighted by A. 
J. 
FISHER, 98 Nassau St., N. Y. 
You kayo heard I 
am awfnlly naughty, 
I 
can't help but say it is true, 
I'm a _nasher, you see, with the ladies, 
And a 
friend to the old women too; 
I'm the favorite at all the parties, 
In the ball room I 
stand number one, 
And the young girls will murmur so sweetly— 
He is such a 
naughty old bum. 
So you see I'm so awfully naughty, 
Oh so naughty, and so haughty; 
The policemen between sixteen and forty, 
Say I 
am such a 
naughty old bum. 
I 
met a 
young charmer one evening, 
As the setting sun rose in the West, 
She looked and she winked her eyes—that way, 
Then she quietly pulled down my vest. 
We were leaning so nice on the water, 
But she shook the son of a 
gun, 
But I 
stole her false teeth when she left me, 
For I 
am such a 
Naughty old bum. 
You notice my ulster's a 
new one, 
A 
gift from Napoleon the First, - 
And I 
often think, yes, and wonder 
Whether it or my dice looks the worst; 
It's my style and my looks, not my clothing, 
That make ladies easily won, 
I 
have mashed Mr. Barnum's " what is it," 
For I 
am such a 
naughty old bum. 
So you see ete.,

All them bums to the counter they do steer.

We'll have meat on that beautiful shore. 
You can see them every hour of the day, 
Around on the corners they do stand, 
A-waiting for some one to treat, 
0 
they will bust up any soup-house in the land. 
CHORUS. 
Oyster pie, they all cry, 
For a 
plate of hash all night they loudly roar; 
And when they die, bye and bye, 
We'll have beats on that beautiful shore. 
Around our large hotels they can be found, 
They all have a 
lunch route of their own, 
They're the terror of the bake shops near and far, 
And at night to some hay-loft they do roam.

American Fortnne-Telling Cards.—This is the `old-
est and most widely known pack of Fortune-Telling Cards. We have 
published it for years, and the demand is continually increasing. 
These Cards are arranged and printed in series— Hearts, Clubs, Dia-
monds and Spades—and each of these into K for King, Q for Queen, 
awl K 
for Knave, and numbers 1, 3, to 10. 
The Cards are arranged in 
four rows, and are to be read according to directions. 
Many of the an-
swers depend upon the position certain cards bear to other cards. The 
method of playing is somewhat complicated, but the directions have 
been made so that very little study will suffice to an ordinary under-
standing. 
Many professional Fortune-Tellers use these cards, and we 
are in receipt of letters in relation to them from all parts of the U. S.

eourting Cards.— This Series of Cards has been arranged 
to meet a 
want frequently felt by young people—a 
want of means of 
expressing one's sentiments in such P. way as to be non-committal. 
Many young ladies are visited by 
iltlemen who are either too diffi-
dent or too fearful of a 
repulse, to venture upon asking the momentous 
question. 
The lady is restrained, by custom and a 
sense of propriety, 
from doing anything that would seem to be an unladylike encourage-
ment. As a 
result of this dilemma, many lives are spent as an unloved 
tedious existence, which might have been prolonged and enjoyed in the 
happiness of matrimony. 
This pack of Cards will overcome the difti, 
culty, and being in the shape of questions and answers, will cover every 
phase of courtship. 
The sentiments conveyed therein need not be 
adopted by the parties to the game as th ei
r 
own, 
unless 
it 
accords 
with 
the state of their affections, which fact makes a 
further explanation un-
necessary. 
The playing of these Cards is not restricted to two players, 
but may be enjoyed by evening parties

And virtue warmed her heart. 
But, ah I 
the cruel spoiler came—" 
This book, in the language of Mrs. Rowson, " affords a

to misery and shame."

A 
Little Book has lately appeared in printat Mr. A. 
J. 
FISHER'S, 98 Was 
sau street, called the " Little Flirt." We 
cannot say that we recommend 
it to our young lady and gentlemen readers, as we think it would only 
encourage the bad habit of 
flirting,." 
Unfortunately, there is enough 
of it done without any further necessity of explaining "how, when and 
where to do it," and this little volume would advise and initiate the.un-
corrupted in practicing what is commonly called "flirting." - 
The N. Y. Evening Telegram writes: " We have lately seen a 
neaflittle 
book, bound in Morocco leather, costing twenty-five cents, calllyi the 
" 
Little Flirt," published by A. J. FISHER, No. 98 Nassau Str&t. 
It 
gives information of the modus operandi of flirting, and of the mean-
ing of every motion of the handkemhief, fan, glove and parasol. As 
there is nothing at all objectionable in the volume, and its contents 
might afford some innocent amusement to many, we do not hesitate to 
recommend it to our young lady and gentlemen readers."
