The Knights of St. Patrick, 
All sons of Ireland, 
Benevolent, brave Irishmen, 
With charity in each band. 
The principle of right 
Determined to maintain, 
And hand it down unto our sons, 
To wear our worthy name. 
Cheer boys! gaily, 
Let the glasses ring, 
With mirth and jollity 
We'll laugh and talk and sing. 
So banish sorrow, 
Drive it from the door; 
The jolly Knights of St. Patrick, 
Hip, hip! Hip, hip! hurrah! 
Continued. 
Grand fellowship our aim, 
Were brothers one and all; 
So swift we start with eager heart, 
When charity makes a 
call. 
Just like our Patron Saint, 
We follow on his plan, 
To do good to humanity, 
And help our fellow man. 
Hip, hip, etc. 
So while the world goes round, 
We keep in friendships track, 
And look ahead with steady tread, 
From charity ne'er turn back. 
The goal is happiness, 
Endeavor to do right; 
There's a 
vacant place for ev'ry face 
Of each St. Patrick Knight.

MY 
Mary Ann's a 
teacher in a 
vat big public school, 
She gets ouellhousand dollars every year, 
She has charge of all the children, you'd never find a 
a 
fool, 
For Mary gives them all the proper steer. 
Oh, she studied Greek and. Latin, real French and Tim-
buctoo, 
German, Spanish, Turk and Hindoostan, Portuguese, 
Irish and Jerusalem Hebrew; 
Such an education has my Mary Ann. 
CHORUS. 
She's a 
darling, she's a 
daisy, 
She's a 
dumpling, she's a 
lamb; 
You should hear her play the pi-an-a, 
Such an education has my Mary Ann. 
•c• 
14 SUCH AN EDUCATION HAS MY MARY ANN. 
My Mary Ann's a 
lady, no contemptible coquette, 
When I 
see her sure ray heart goes in a 
drame; 
She is thoroughly conversant with the art of etiquette, 
And at cards she'd beat old Hoyle himself a 
game. 
Oh, she'd play you whist or cribbage, forty-fives or 
casino, 
And she'll dale the cards just 
like a 
gamblin' man, 
• 
poker or peaknuckle, or Sanky oh Pedro, 
Such an education has my Mary Ann. 
She's a 
darling, etc. 
My Mary Ann's a 
dancer in the art of terpsichore, 
You should see her forward four and alainandi ; 
She'd break up all the lumber that you'd put down on 
the floor, 
Such a 
heavy stepper is my Mary Ann. 
Oh, she'd dance you the mazourka, a 
polka or quadrille, 
Reel or jig or shuffle in the sand, schottishe or the Ger-
man you couldn't keep her still, 
Such an education has my Mary Ann. 
She's a 
darling, etc. 
MY MARY ANN. 
Written for Miss firrriE O'NEIL, by ED. HARRIGAN. 
On! My Mary Ann is an artizan, 
In a 
factory ' way down town, 
She makes umbrellas for the high-toned fellers, 
And she lives six stories from the ground, 
In a 
brick tenement, where they cut up devilment 
Every night in the week and every day. 
My sweet Mary Ann walks out upon the sand, 
Ev'ry summer at Rockway. 
Her big brother Dan is a 
laboring man, 
On the pipes he's a 
civil engineer, 
His feet are as large as a 
picnic barge, 
He wears gum drops in his ears, 
He has a 
voice like a 
thrush, and he feeds on mush, 
He's fond of his sister, they say. 
Sweet Mary Ann walks out upon the sand, 
With her big brother Dan at Rockaway 
Sweet Mary Ann plays the grand plan, 
She never studies notes from the book, 
The music clear-lays all in her ear, 
As she rattles it off with her hands. 
Sundays nights, when the parlor's full, 
And dear Camelia May will you give me a 
welcome 
here ? 
Then sweet Mary Ann walks out upJ n‘the sand, 
Every summer on the beach at Rockaway.

16 "YOU NEVER WILL BE GRUBSTRUCK 
TILL THE GRUB RUNS OUT. 
Composed and sung by P. J. DOWNEY. 
AIR:—You7/ Never Miss the Water. 
W HEN a 
boy in Pennsylvania, 
With a 
rounder on a 
tramp, 
A 
short and truthful lesson 
On my memory he did stamp; 
One day while I 
was eating pie, 
I 
threw some cake away, 
He turned his foggy eyes around, 
And this to me did say: 
Chorus. 
Pick it up again, John, pick it up, I 
say, 
Roll it in your handkerchief for a 
rainy day; 
To you it will be useful, of this I 
have no doubt, 
For you never will be grubstruck till the grub 
runs out. 
One day while stealing chickens, 
A 
farmer fired a 
shot, 
Dave whispered softly in my car, 
It's time to take a 
drop; 
We ran through mud up to our eyes, 
I 
threw a 
duck away; 
Once more he turned his foggy eyes, 
And this to me did say: 
Pick it up again, etc. 
Now Dave is on the Island, 
A 
serving out a 
year; 
When thinking of his hungry face, 
I 
have to drop a 
tear. 
And when Pm passing by the place 
Where he has got to stay, 
I 
have to think of hungry Dave, 
And what he med to say: 
Pick it up again, etc.

HELMICK. 14.16 West Fourth St.. 
Cincinnati, 0. 
Written, Composed and sung by BOBBY-NEWCOMB. 
Whi_n the summor breese was blowing 
O'er the land and far across the sea ; 
I 
met a 
little blue-eyed stranger, 
As pretty as can be, 
Her dress the pink of neatness, 
Her walk the height of grace, 
Her smile the mould of sweetness, 
And such a 
handsome face. 
CHORUS. 
Oh! when the summer breeze was blowing, 
O'er the land and far across the sea, 
I 
met a 
little blue-eyed stranger, 
As pretty as can be. 
Wavy golden ringlets flowing 
To the breeze so merry, light and free, 
That kissed the little blue-eyed stranger; 
As pretty as can be. 
Towards her I 
walked gaily, 
While waves rolled ou the shore, 
I 
tried to speak, but vainly, 
I 
ne'er felt so before. 
Oh! when the summer, etc. 
The sequel to the story knowing, 
The end of course you'd like to here from me; 
I've wed this little blue-eyed stranger; 
As pretty as can be. 
We're living in contentment 
Just. down by the shore, 
And another little stranger 
Now plays around the door. 
Oh! when the summer, etc.

SHE DIED ON THE STREET. 
Composed and sung by P. J. DowN-Ev. 
Dark was the night and the snow it was falling, 
Streets all deserted, the wind bleak and chill, 
These who were happy were silently sleeping, 
Death in its mantle could not be more still. 
Hark to a 
noise—heavens, some one is crying? 
Some one to-night is a-snfIerin , I 
fear. 
" 
Help me, oh, help me, oh, Lord, I 
am dying! 
Must I 
die friendless, is nobody near?" 
Chorus. 
Starving and crying, friendless and dying, 
Wandering about but no friend could she meet; 
Cold winds a-teasing, her poor heart a-freezing, 
Heaven relieved her, she died on the street. 
Once I 
was young and as pure as a 
dew-drop, 
Often my parents were asked for my hand.; 
Oh, no—no, never, they could not part with me, 
Mother thought I 
was the best in the land. 
When they were dying, for me they were praying; 
heaven have mercy, I 
cannot help crV, 
I 
sent them both to th(iir grave broken-hearted, 
Now on the street a 
poor outcast I 
die. 
Starving ,
etc. 
Where, oh, where—oh, where is my Mary? 
Long years have gone since I 
parted from thee; 
Why did I 
leave you in grief and temptation, 
Death, come to me and my mind will be free. 
Man, go away and sit down to repentance, 
To see your poor Mary Cis no use to crave, 
She now roams in heaven where God will protect 
her, 
Her body lies deep in a 
lone pauper's grave. 
Starving, etc.

OUR ARMY AND NAVY OF BLUE. 
Written, Composed and sung by BOBBY NEWCOMBE. 
Copyrighted 1878, by E. H. HARDING. 
LIST to the music while I 
sing a 
lay, 
In praise of our flag, boys, that's waved for many a 
day; 
It sheltered our soldiers and sailors so true, 
It covers our Army and Navy of Blue. 
CHORUS. 
Over our heads, boys, flaunting to the breeze; 
Up to the peak greeting all lands and sees! 
The emblem of Liberty, ever so true, 
That covers our Army and Navy of Blue. 
Peace be our motto, charity our cause, 
Faith to our colors, respect to our laws 
Friendship our greeting, our flag as it flew 
Inspired our brave Army and Navy of Blue. 
CHORUS. 
Over our heads, boys, flaunting to the breeze; 
Up to the peak, greeting all lands and seas ! 
The emblem of Liberty ever so true, 
that covers our Army and Navy of Blue.

THE RICH, 
BUT NOT THE POOR. 
Words by P. J. DOWNEY. Sung by SAM BROWN. 
Ant:—Anierican Boy. 
'TIS but a 
few short years ago 
When war raged in our land, 
A moneyed man was not ashamed. 
To shake a 
poor man's hand. 
But since that time the tables turned, 
Good nature lost its sway, 
The poor were once a 
friend in need, 
But now they're in the way. 
Chorus. 
Our land was once the pride of all, 
With labor always sure, 
But now it is the pride of one, 
The rich, but not the poor. 
Were we not all created by 
Our Lord who reigns on high, 
How can it be where plenty lies, 
A man from want must die; 
We ask for work And nothing more, 
That you to us can give, 
Don't covet all, give us a 
share, 
And let a 
poor man live. 
Our land, etc. 
Farewell to bright and joyful days, 
You've left us in despair, 
It seems the bond of freedom's land 
has melted into air; 
There was a 
time when your green shore 
A 
broken heart would cure, 
But now it is a 
paradise 
For rich, but not the poor. 
Our land, etc. 
Sung by McANDREws. 
MY 
old misses promised me, 
Gwine to git a 
home by-and-by, 
When she died she'd set me free, 
Gwine to git a 
home by-and-by; 
She did live till she got bald, 
Gwine to git a 
home by-and-
by, 
And she never died at all, 
Gwine to git a 
home by-and-by. 
Chorus. 
Den oh! dat watermelon, 
Lamb of goodness you must die, 
I'm gwine to join de contraband children) 
Gwine to git a 
home by-and-by. 
A 
shoo- fly cut a

Gwine to get a

A

Gwine to git a

THERE'S A WASHBILL IN THE 
LETTER. 
"Written by HARRY BURNS, Pittsburg, Pa., August, 1878. 
Parody on "A Letter in the Candle." 
(All rights reserved.) 
THERE'S a 
washbill in the letter, 
And I 
wish it wasn't me, 
How I 
wish I 
was a 
soldier 
Or a 
sailor out at sea; 
For she's always dunning—dunning, 
Till I 
don't know what to do, 
And she tells me in this letter 
That she'll beat me black and blue. 
Chorus. 
What shall I 
do? trouble o'er and o'er, 
Is there no private passage, 
She's watching at the door; 
Oh, how I 
feel, sweating from ench pore, 
To find some private passage, 
To pass her at the door; 
When I 
got out how she ripped and tore, 
You bet your bottom dollar 
I 
don't go there no more. 
It is nothing much, it's only 
A 
little washing bill, 
And she swears if I 
don't settle, 
She will surely make me ill; 
Slie is ' round here somewhere, handy, 
And she's twice as big as I, 
And if I 
had golden winglets, 
Like an elephant I'd fly. 
What shall I 
do, etc. 
THERE'S A WASHBILL IN THE 
23 
LETTER. Continued. 
There she's standing in the hallway, 
A 
poker in her hand, 
If 5110 offers for to strike me, 
I 
will shout for Mary Ann; 
For I 
would not fight a 
woman 
While there's any chance to run, 
There, by Jove! the old dame's coming, 
Holy heavens, I'm undone! 
What shall I 
do, etc. 
THE GREY HAIRS OF MY MOTHER. 
Words by GEORGE COOPER. 
Music by T. BRIGHAM BISHOP. 
THE grey hairs of my mother, 
This' tress—this tress recalls them now, 
Again I 
see them cluster, 
In beauty—in beauty ' round her brow; 
Oh, ho W 
tender are the mem'ries 
That wake from out the past, 
I 
live again life's morning, 
Too beautiful—too beautiful to last. 
61/
2orus. 
Oh, the grey hairs of my mother, 
This tress—this tress recalls them now, 
Again I 
see them cluster, 
In beauty—in beauty ' round her brow. 
(Repeat.) 
Once more I 
kneel at twilight, 
In childhood's simple, earnest pray'r, 
Once more I 
see the homestead, 
And all—and all the blessings there! 
Oh, lovely tress of silver, 
Whatever cares may be, 
My heart in all it's trials 
Is nearer Heav'n—is nearer Heav'n for thee. 
Oh, the grey hairs. etc. 
24 DOWN WHERE THE WATER LILIES 
GROW. 
Sung with great success by Miss CARRIE DUNCAN at Tony 
Pastor's theater. 
"TwAs in the plmsant summer time 
I 
met him all by chance, 
The robins sang their sweetest rhyme, 
And loving was their glance; 
We wandered ' midst the blooming flowers, 
He called me sweet and fair, 
The queen of all the sunny bowers, 
The brightest rosebud there. 
SPOKEN.—Oh, he was such a 
charming, such a 
delightful young fellow, that I 
never can forget: 
ChOPHS. 
When we met there by the river 
In the sunlight's merry glow, 
For my heart he won forever 
Down where the water lilies grow. 
He whispered words of fond delight, 
The birds they listened, too, 
We wandered till the stars at night 
Shone out in sky so blue; 
When arm in arm we wandered on, 
Way down, the lonely lane, 
lie said he'd never roam alone, 
..And we soon met again. 
SP0KEN.—We are meeting quite often now, and. 
nevey will forget the first time: 
When we met there by the river, etc. 
THE DAY I PLAYED BASE BALL. 
25 
Sung by PAT ROONEY. 
111y name it is O'llallolier, 
I'm a 
man that's influential, 
I 
mind my business, stop at home, 
My wants are few and small; 
Some blackguards ' tother day did come, 
They were full of whiskey, gin and rum, 
An' they took me out in the broilin' sun, 
To play a 
game of ball. 
They made me carry all the bats, 
They nearly drove me crazy, 
An' then they sent me out in " center field," 
But I 
paralyzed them all; 
I 
put up me hands to catch a "fly," 
Holy murther! it struck me in the eye, 
And they hung me on a 
line to dry, 
The day I 
played base ball. 
I 
took the bat an' hit the ball, 
I 
thought to San Franscisco, 
An' thin around the bases 
Three times I 
ran them all; 
But thin the gang began to bowl, 
An' they said: " Ould man, you made a 
foul, 
An' they rubbed me down with a 
Turkish towel 
The day I 
played base ball. 
Two reporters begged to know me name, 
An' presinted me with a 
medal, 
An ' they asked me for me photograph 
f0 hang upon the wall; 
They said that I 
had won the game, 
Though my head was broke and my shoulder lame, 
An' they sent me home in a 
cattle train, 
The day I 
played base ball.

LITTLE MOUNTAIN DAISY. 
SONG AND DANCE. 
Words by -FRANK DUMONT. 
Music by FRED TUTHITE. 
IN 
yonder little moss- grown cottage 
Where beauteous daisies grow, 
A 
little blue-eyed darling's waiting 
With cheeks that are aglow; 
Like the blossom of the roses, 
Like aurora's brightest beam, 
Her image haunts me night and day, 
In one long pleasant dream. 
Chorus. 
MY 
love for her I 
must confess (break), 
And ask the folks our love to bless, (
break), 
The wedding bells will sweetly chime, 
As hand in hand we stray, 
M Y 
mountain daisy will be mine 
Upon that happy day. 
We often talk about the future, 
Build castles in the air; 
I 
fancy that 1 
rule a 
kingdom, 
And my little queen is there. 
But 1'11 ask for nothing more 
Than my darling's love so pure, 
It will outlast all earthly wealth, 
And thro' this life endure.

HE 
gave me a 
pretty red rose, 
While rambling to-night o'er the lea. 
And said, as he kissed me good-by, 
" 
Wear this in your breast, love, for me." 
'Tis fading and falling apart, 
But close to my heart it will cling, 
While lonely I 
sigh for my darling's bright eye, 
Of my pretty red rose I 
will sing. 
Chorus. 
My pretty red rose—my pretty red rose, 
'Tis a 
sweet little token, my pretty red rose, 
While lonely I 
sigh for my darling's bright eye, 
I'll sing of my pretty red rose. 
'Tis a 
dear little mem'ry of love, 
How sad that it soon must decay, 
But fondly I'll treasure its leaves, 
Though their beauty may vanish away. 
Sweet moments of joy it recalls, 
,And lulls every sigh to repose; 
Tho' now we're apart, still my true lover's heart 
Seems to dwell in my pretty red rose. 
My pretty red rose, etc.

I'VE a 
letter from thy sire, 
Baby mine—baby mine; 
I 
could read and never tire, 
Baby mine—baby mine. 
He is sailing o'er the sea, 
He is coming back to me, 
He is coming back to me, 
Baby mine—baby mine, 
He is coming back to me, 
Baby mine. 
Oh! I 
long to see his face, 
Baby mine—baby mine, 
In his old accustomed place, 
Baby mine—baby mine. 
Like the rose of May in bloom, 
Like a 
star amid the gloom, 
Like the sunshine in the room, 
Baby mine—baby mine, 
Like .the sunshine in the room, 
Baby mine. 
I'm so glad I 
cannot sleep, 
Baby mine—baby mine, 
I'm so happy I 
could weep, 
Baby mine— baby mine. 
He is sailing o'er the sea, 
He is coming home to me. 
He is coming back to thee, 
Baby mine—baby mine, 
He is coming back to thee, 
Baby mine.

CLOWN OF THE PANTOMIME. 
ONE night I 
was kindly invited 
To take a 
fair girl to a 
show, 
And with it I 
was so delighted, 
That I 
quite forgot my dear Jo, 
Until I 
beheld my fair damsel, 
• On whom I 
hal spent so much time, 
A winking and flirting like fury 
With the clown of the pantomime. 
It made me so wild and uneasy, 
That I 
did not dare to turn ' round, 
For fear that I'd see my dear Josey 
A winking at the pantomime clown. 
The clown would make funny faces, 
Then heels over head he would t.0
-o-
And throw himself down by the footlights, 
Then smile and look over at Jo. 
Oh. then. how I 
wished I 
was near him, 
I'd punch off the half of his crown; 
For I 
couldn't bear to see Josey 
In love with a 
pantomime clown. 
Next day I 
went to call on her, 
But Josey wasn't to be found; 
Tier mother she sobbed as she told me— 
She'd run off with a 
pantomime clown.

Air:—Grandfather's Clock. 
MY 
grandfather's socks were a 
pleasure to his feet, 
So he wore them for ninety years or more; 
Their color was doubtful, yet still they looked neat, 
When shoeless he used to walk the floor; 
When you looked upon their size, it would dazzle 
both your eyes, 
As you saw how well his toes they did hide, 
But they dropped off, never to be worn again, 
So the old man cried. 
Chorus. 
Ninety years without changing them, oh-ho! oh-ho! 
Never disarranging them, oh-ho! oh-ho! 
But they dropped off, never to be worn again, 
So the old man cried. 
His feet were as large when but a 
year old, 
As they were when a 
man he had grown, 
So socks he must have to keep out the cold, 
So a 
graceful pair his feet soon did own. 
When on, so well they fit, they would not budge 
a 
bit, 
When to get them off so bard his mother tried, 
But they dropped off, never to be worn again, 
So the old man cried. 
Ninety years, etc. 
MY GRANDFATHER'S SOCKS. 
Continued. 
My grandfather said that of socks he could buy, 
He would like to see the pair to equal those, 
They kept his feet so warm, comfortable and dry, 
Since the day his feet they first did enclose. 
He was in a 
blissful maze, when upon them he did 
gaze, 
For they always filled his heart with joy and 
pride, 
But they dropped off, never to be worn again, 
So the old man cried. 
Ninety years, etc. 
One night sound asleep, and in a 
pleasant snore, 
My grandfather awoke with a 
start, 
For the sockethey had parted, and dropped on the 
floor, 
Which sent a 
dreadful chill to his heart. 
When all through the house, which was quiet as a 
mouse, 
Weeping soon was heard on every side, 
his socks had dropped off, never to be worn again, 
So the old man cried. 
Ninety years, etc.

PATRIOTS OF IRELAND. 
Sung by JAMES O'NEIL, Great Irish Vocalist. 
Now, friends, if you will listen I'll sing to you a. 
song 
Of Ireland and her sons we loved so dear; 
There were patriots and heroes, and their names 
we love to hear, 
For the green they were not afraid to wear. 
There was one so young and noble, who for his 
country died, 
To remember him the Irish won't forget; 
Perhaps you've read his speeches in the Irish his-
tory; 
This hero's name was Robert Emmet. 
Chorus. 
Then give three cheers for Ireland, 
And let the people see 
That our rifles all are ready 
To set old Ireland free. 
There's another I 
will mention, and to Irishmen 
most dear, 
And for Ireland lie proved a 
useful tool, 
I 
mean Dan O'Connell, may his soul now rest in 
peace, 
For dearly he loved Ireland and home rule. 
There were three patriots .to this world did bid 
good- by 
Before they could finish their design, 
They died hand in hand trying to free their native 
land, 
Three martyrs, Allen, Larkin and O'Brien. 
Then giye, etc.

Now America had her heroes, and she loved them 
well, I'm sure, 
Take the history and you'll know what they have 
done. 
There was General Lafayette, a 
Frenchman so truo, 
And our own immortal General Washington. 
'Tis now one hundred years, since the country they 
did free, 
And drove the English tyrant from our shore; 
I 
wish that every Irishman could have the same to 
say, 
Then Ireland would be free for evermore.

Our Lillie loved the spring flowers, 
And. often told their praises, 
,She loved the early blossoms, 
But most of all the daisies; 
And when the twilight shadows 
Come with the silent hours, 
She prayed to leave her happy home 
And slumber with the flowers. 
We pressed her eyelids gently down, 
And hushed the little lisper; 
But the wish was heard in Heaven, 
And. angels caught the whisper; 
So, when the wandering sunbeams 
Were caught in leafy mazes, * 
We bud our little Lillie 
To sleep among the daisies.

WALKING OUT ON SUNDAY. 
Sung with great success, by M ISS CARRIE DUNCAN, at Tony 
Pastor's Theater. 
W ALKING out 011 SUIlday I think very nice, 
What I 
would dispense with, not at any price; 
So when the weather's proper, I'm ready in a 
trice, 
To take my usual walk out on Sunday. 
A 
drive out in a " trap" now some folks seem to 
prize, 
But the exercise of walking I 
would much advise, 
And oh, such funny sights, and oh, such horrid 
guys 
You meet with when you're walking out on 
Sunday. 
Chorus. 
Walking out on Sunday in the afternoon, 
Crawling out on Sunday in the afternoon, 
Driving out on Sunday in the afternoon, 
It's awful jolly walking out on Sunday. 
Now there's Augustus Tompkins, a 
very heavy 
,swell, 
He manages to live somewhere on Murray Hill, 
You'd take him for a 
banker or a 
broker down on 
Wall street, 
When he crawls out to do his walk on Sunday. 
With his silver-beaded cane, and a 
glass stuck in 
one eye, 
lie twirls his fine mustache, which suspicious looks 
of dye, 
In fact you seldom see so elegant a 
guy, 
As Tompkins when he's crawling out on Sunday.

Chorus. 
Those happy days will come no more, 
With all their cares and joys, 
But still I 
love you as of old, 
When you and I 
were boys. 
We've wandered far from home and friends, 
And all we loved most dear, 
But to those friends my heart still bends, 
Through every by-gone year; 
And oft in dreams I 
see your face, 
That makes my heart rejoice, 
And all our fun and frolics trace, 
When you and I 
were boys. 
Those happy days, etc. 
I 
often see the old schoolhouse 
That stood upon the hill, 
'Tis pictured in my mem'ry, Tom, 
It makes my pulses thrill. 
I 
see the old mill standing there, 
But hushed is all its noise., 
'Tis changed around the old house, Tom, 
Since you and I 
were boys. ,

I'm a 
naturalized citizen of this great land, 
And I'm proud of the honor, I'm sure; 
In polities I'm quite a 
prominent man, 
And respected by rich and by poor. 
Now I 
try to be civil to every one, 
But they've not the same manners toward me, 
For its up and down as I'm strolling along, 
These words they will say unto me: 
Chorus. 
" 
llow are you, Macduff, don't you think you look 
tough?" 
Expressions like these makes me wrathy, 
And whenever I 
say, " lave off with your play," 
They say, " Dully, you're giving us taffy." 
They'll, tell me go put my feet in a 
frame, 
And go chase myself 'round the square, 
And they say that if Barnum knew I 
was alive 
lle'd have me caged up with his bear; 
Now, I 
know I'm not handsome, but this much 
I'm sure. 
To do right I 
always did try, 
And the next man what tells me to sit down on 
myself, 
I'll put a 
lump over his eye. 
How are etc. 
They say that my feet occupy the whole street, 
With my bunions the people can't pass; 
And say that my face would stop the horse-cars, 
And my ears just look like a 
jackass; 
But let them all talk until they are sick, 
'They're jealous because they're not me, 
I'm a 
sound Irishman, and that they'll find out, 
And they'll never find taffy in me. 
How are, etc.

Is kiss'd by the forest bee, 
Then why not, fairest, loveliest, dearest,

The belle of all the town, 
If other nigs should. flirt with hei, 
My heart she would break down.

Out in the starlight, with charming little Lue, 
She is my heart's delight, ever fond and true; 
Her bright blue eyes, enchanting, pierce me through

The idol of this darkey's heart is charming little 
Lue! 
Ohl don't I 
love to meet her 
In the shady dell; 
When little stars are twinkling, 
Such tales of love we tell. 
Oh! she can whisper softly 
As the wind blows through the trees, 
Two loving hearts beat quick and fast, 
As her little hand I 
squeeze.

W HEN a 
little boy I 
wandered, ' twas a 
pleasant 
summer's day, 
My heart was like a 
feather as I 
journeyed on 
my way, 
To my eager footsteps soft the green grass laid, 
With a 
little playmate, such a 
tiny maid; 
Playing I 
was poor man, playing she was rich, 
how her merry laughter reached the highest pitch, 
Pointing to the daisies silver wealth untold, 
Buttercups unnumbered, these she said were gold. 
With the time departing soon the air was chilled, 
Out upon the crisp wind loud the robin thrilled, 
Once again I 
wandered with my little maid, 
To our treasure garden vast in wealth arrayed; 
Soon we knew a 
robber, Jack Frost was his name, 
hind been there before us and. taken all our gain 
With his icy fingers and a 
grasp so cold, 
Stole our silver daisies and buttercuips of gold. 
Man's estate I 
reached then, but I 
ne'er forgot 
My little maid companion and our treasure spot; 
For thera was a 
lesson in our strange belief, 
Summer was our banker, winter was our thief; 
So it is with friends, then sometimes so with all, 
They're true to us in sunshine but leave us in 
the fall; 
When a 
warm friend slights me or he treats me 
cold, 
I 
think of silver daisies and buttercups of gold. 
46 YOU MAY DO IT IF YOU WANT TO. 
Words and music by GEORGE G. 
HART. 
I 
ONCE was deep in love with a 
charming little dear, 
And when in her society I 
always felt so queer; 
I 
mustered up my cheek, and asked her for a 
kiss, 
She blushed and hesitated, and answered me like' 
this: 
Chorus. 
You can do it if you want to, for I 
really can't re-
sist you, 
You are such a 
charming fellow, to refuse you is 
absurd. 
As time passed on I 
found I'd have to get a 
wife, 
I 
asked her if she'd like to be my better-half 
through life? 
IIer answer it was " yes," so to her papa I 
went, 
And as I'd money plenty, why, he quickly gavo 
consent. 
SPOKEN.—Yes, I 
was pretty well fixed, as I 
asked the " 'Old Gent" for his daughter's band, 
heart, and so forth, and he says: " Well, I've no 
objection; of course, you know Galatea' hasn't 
any money—but as long as you love her, why, that 
don't make any difference—and as to marrying her, 
my dear boy, why "— 
You can, etc. 
I 
went with rapid steps, to tell her of my plan, 
And found her sitting on thg lap of a 
handsome-
looking man;

I 
LIKE my share of pleasure, and I'll have it if I 
can,

loving woman—respect an honest man; 
I 
like to see true friendship in the life that's roll-
ing by, 
And such I 
hope to always find between old friends 
and I. 
Chorus. 
Dear old friends, jolly old friends, 
Clinging together in all sorts o' weather. 
Dear old friends, jolly old friends. 
Give me the friendship of dear old friends. 
We've tasted of the ups of life, we've also felt its 
downs; 
Sometimes our pockets were quite full, but some-
time fortune frowns; 
And be our drink bright, sparkling wine, or simply 
good, plain beer, 
The grasp of friendship is the same through each 
succeeding year. 
Sox:—For we are  
Dear old friends, etc. 
It's ever been my motto, and will be to the end, 
To help a 
stranger when I 
can, and never desert a, 
friend; 
And after winning life's hard fight, what sweet re-
ward is found, 
In a 
conscience clear, a 
heart that's light, with dear 
old friends around. 
Dear old friends, etc.

PROVE YOURSELF THE POOR MAN'S 49 
FRIEND, INDEED. 
Continued. 
For hunger's bitter pangs we all do dread. 
Now our preachers say the same, and for them it 
is a 
shame, 
In the pulpit, they say, help those who need, 
With their thousands every year, if they'd give a 
little free'r. 
They'd prove themselves the poor man's friend in-
deed. 
There are many men now gone who helped those 
forlorn, 
And the poor man prays for them both night 
and day, 
And there's many now that's worse, that gets the 
poor man's curse, 
While their prayers are for better, now I 
say. 
Jim Fisk so good and true, on the poor man did 
bestow, 
A 
loaf of bread to those who most did need; 
-And though Tweed now lies in jail, we tell of him 
the same tale, 
They proved themselves the poor man's friend, in-
deed. 
But this maxim, eta.

On, I 
never shall forget the happy days, 
Happy days—happy days! 
When upon the old plantation, all the darkies took 
vacation, 
And they left their heavy work fInd went to play. 
Then we took the banjo, fiddle and. the bones, 
And the bones—and the bones! 
And you ought to hear the ringing of the merry 
voices singing, 
In the chorus of the dulcimatic tones. 
Chorus. 
Oh, happy days! sweet happy days!

Oh, I 
never shall forget Miss Susie Brown, 
Susie Brown—Susie Brown! 
Yes, the beauty of her mouth, was a 
picture of the 
south, 
And they say she was " the belle of all the town." 
We used to be together all the while, 
All the while—all the while! 
And she looked so very charming, that I

A

THE ACTORS' GREAT BALL. 
An original song by FRANK LEWIS. As sung by him with 
great  success. 
A 
COMICAL story I'm going to tell you, 
I 
wrote it to please both the great and the small; 
It's about some good fun I 
had in this city. 
One night at the Actor's Professional Ball.• 
The first set of quadrilles was danced by Tony 
Pastor. 
Of which Clara Morris the figures did call; 
Mr. Daly and Pique waltzed ' round faster and 
faster— 
There was fun, you can bet, at the Actors' 
Great Ball! 
Josh Hart brought his Eagle to fly at the party. 
John Brougham a 
kiss from Miss Neilson he 
took, 
Lester Wallack, he shaved off his whiskers, and 
gave them 
-Unto the Two Orphans of Sheridan Shook. 
Mr. Levy, he played on his cornet a 
solo, 
As he sat in the Crucible of Oakey Hall. 
Pat Rooney and Harry Bennett, to enliven the 
meeting, 
Danced the Tra-la-la-loo, at the Actors' Great 
Ball. 
Jennie Engle appeared with her flags used in sing- 0 
ing, 
And Sol Smith Russel commenced for to blow, 
Harry IIill's Female Boxers went in to fling him 
To the place underneath, where all actors do go. 
Then Kelly and Leon went in rough and tumble, 
Tore Leon's new dress, which cost thousands, 
he'll say, 
Gus Williams got his steam up and bursted his 
boiler, • 
And John Hart, the skeleton, he fainted away. 
THE ACTORS' GREAT BALL. 
53 
Continued. 
Billy Pastor then tried to waltz with Miss Mark-
ham, 
But his body was large and his legs they were 
small, 
So he got the two Brahams to drop all their H's, 
They tripped up Jennie Hughes, her sweet vo-
cals and all. 
Anna Dickinson then danced, her crown of thorns 
wearing, 
Which gave to the critics an unmerciful shock, 
While Jarret and Palmer made Tooker keep swear-
ing— 
There was no boat afloat like the great Plymouth 
Rock. 
As daylight approached, the fun kept increasing; 
Mr. Theodore Moss called his Jockey a 
fool— 
Then Boucicault came in with a 
play he had stol-
en, 
And closed up the daylights of friend, John F. 
Poole. 
Just then occurred what you would call a 
commo-
tion, 
Kate Claxton had Fanny Davenport pinned 
'gainst the wall, 
Harrigan & Hart then appeared in their unequalled 
effusions, 
And that put an end to the Actors' Great Ball.

THE DONKEY. " I'LL SEE HIM JUST ONCE MORE." 55 
Words and music by the late JAMES BRADLEY. As sung with 
great success all over the country by TIM ROGERS. 
I'VE got a 
donkey, he stands six foot high, 
l'll sell to the man that wishes to buy, 
He drinks Seltzer water whenever he's dry, 
In a 
race on the turf he has never proved shy; 
He makes good. time, about one mile a 
day, 
I'll match him again any stallion or bay; 
He fought for his country, he's been through the 
war, 
I 
feed him on herrings, hay-rope and tar. 
C710 PUS. 
I've got a 
donkey, he's not very chunky, 
I'll trade for a 
monkey, to any old flunkey, 
Now wouldn't that be hunky if he had my donkey, 
And I 
had his monkey, my donkey also? 
If he's locked in the stable he'll make a 
stiff kick, 
If he wants to get out he'll pretend he is sick; 
I 
call out my donkey—his name it is Dick, 
I 
coax him along with a 
hickory stick. 
If I 
leave in his box a 
big bale of hay, 
He'll eat it all up and leave none for next day, 
Last week he broke loose and he got astray, 
He was found in a 
sewer in Avenue A. 
I've got a 
donkey, etc. 
I 
harnessed him up last St. Patrick's day, 
I 
rode on his back so cheerful and. gay, 
We started from the corner of Tenth and Broad-
way, 
We rode to the hall without any delay; 
Just as we were passing by Central Park, 
A 
boy fired. a 
pistol off, just for a 
lark, 
The donkey fell down which caused a 
blockade, 
Only for fifty horse-doctors he'd spoil the parade. 
I've got a 
donkey, etc.

Oh! no, I'll never see him more, 
Since thus he likes to roam, 
And when his team stops at the door, 
I'll say Pm not at home; 
He smiled last night when Julia smiled, 
They must have met before, 
If thus by her he is beguiled, 
I'll never see him more; 
If thus by her he is beguiled, 
I'll never see him more, 
No more, no more, no more. 
This ring, his gift, I 
will return, 
It makes my finger sore, 
And all his letters I 
will burn, 
And trample on the floor; 
His sonnet that my album graced, 
My tears shall blot it o'er, 
The leaves together I 
will paste, 
And ne'er behold it more; 
The leaves together I 
will paste, 
And ne'er behold it more, 
No more, no more, no more. 
I'll waltz and flirt With Charley G., 
Though voted oft a 
bore, 
I'll show him that my heart is free, 
And sigh for him no more; 
If we should meet his eye shall shrink, 
My scornful glance before, 
Hark! that's his ring, here, Jane, 
I 
think I'll see him just once more; 
hark! that's his ring, here, Jane, 
I 
think I'll see him just once more, 
Once more, once more once more.

56 WHEN I'VE PASSED IN MY CHECKS. 
A parody on " See that my grave's kept green." 
By L. J. 
KOHLMANN (LEW COLE). 
W HEN I've passed in my checks and have flown 
from your side, my darling, 
When your humble servant is snugly stowed away 
. . 
in his cold drear grave, 
When my spirit has winged its flight to the ethe-
real spheres generally designated by the term 
Heaven, 
To the locality where sulphurous fires and brim-
stone is not known to exist. 
When you are in that state of happiness and gaiety 
naturally characteristic of your nature once 
again, 
Exercising your memory in thoughts pertaining to 
the happy time that has been, 
There exists one diminutive favor .I 
would consid-
er an insult to my memory if you would fail 
to attend to, 
See that the mound that covers my artificial incrus-
tation is kept in its natural state of verdancy. 
GUMS. 
Oh! the. periods of twenty-four hours each will 
come to you, my darling, 
When no more I 
shall be observable to the multi-
tude on this mundane sphere, 
WHEN PVE PASSED IN MY CHECKS. 57 
Continued. 
One exquisite little wish, darling, I 
hope you will 
have the benevolence to grant me, 
Observe that the hillock that o'ertops my last rest-
ing-place is kept in its primitive state of 
perpetual greenness. 
Will you retain your humble servant, my love, in 
fond. recollection, 
When the volubility of grumblers, in general, un-
pleasantly jars upon the sense of hearing, 
When others may utter their complaints in con-
demnation and faultfinding, 
Speak not one single word that does not savor of 
your usual kindness and benevolence; 
When you have as usual regained you equilibrity 
and exuberance of spirits once again, 
Remembering with vivid imagination the fond 
recollections of former days, 
There is but one small-sized wish I 
would have 
your royal highness attend to, 
See that my little narrow bed is kept in its origi-
nal and primitive state of freshness. 
Oh! the periods, etc.

The birds they are dreaming of porn; 
Sad is the moon, tho' in radiance beaming,

Roses and lilies so gentle and loving, 
Are dreaming, I 
know, in the dew, 
So when afar you are thoughtlessly roving, 
Your Norah is dreaming of you! 
Chorus. 
Still ram waiting, so sadly and lonely, 
Oh, tell me if still you are true! 
Dream of me, darling, for one moment only, 
While Norah, your Norah is dreaming of you! 
Tho' you forget me when far you are roaming, 
I 
shall not believe it, my own! 
Don't you remember you said. in the gloaming, 
That I 
was your darling alone! 
Come to my heart like a 
bird that is weary, 
Oh, come to your Norah so true! 
Linger not long, for the days they are weary, 
While Norah is dreaming of you! 
Still I 
am waiting, etc.

W E'RE the double- dancing darkies, 
With movements just the same; 
Our " Wonderful Clock-Working Jig" 
Has gained us great fame. 
Our steps, they have a

So artistically they're done; 
We work so well together—that 
They say that we are one. 
When we appear and make our bow, 
A 
grand reception greets us, 
We accomplish with ease the most difficult step, 
Which proves that none can beat us. 
With lightning rapidity our feet do fly 
To sweet strains from the band; 
Impossible seems the execution 
Through radiant silver sand. 
Our

And " Quit Bat," " Let Me Be,"

64 GOD BLESS OUR DEAR OLD FLAG. 
Dedicated to my esteemed friend, Miss C. E. DE S1TEPPARD, 
with best wishes. 
Original song, as sung by FRANK LEWIS, 
at the New National Theater, Philadelphia. 
IN 
this glorious land of freedom, exciting times 
have been, 
I 
often picture in my mind, each great and stirring 
scene; 
I 
never looked upon the place where our starry 
flag did fly, 
But the great events of by-gone days, to picture 
them I'd try. 
'Twas a 
noble sight at Yorktown, when Washing-
ton did stand, 
And took the sword from that great lord, who did 
invade our native land; 
lie tried his best to win the fight, and low our ban-
ner drag, 
But the Yankee boys ' rose in their might, and 
saved our dear old flag. 
Again when shot and shell they flew, like hailstones 
thick and fast, 
A 
gallant youth he braved them all, 'as he clung 
to the mast; 
lie seized our country's emblem, which had been 
shot away, 
And waved it in the foeman's face, 'way down in 
Mobile bay; 
A 
Yankee cheer it then went up, in triumph from 
our fleet, 
And soon the enemy gave way, defeated, cowed 
and beat; 
The boy descended to the deck, of Farragut we 
brag' 
And every brave tar with joy cried out: " God 
bless our dear old flag!' 
GOD BLESS OUR DEAR OLD FLAG. 65 
Continued. 
Again when trouble came us o'er, and darkest was 
the hour, 
A 
noble general, staunch and brave, he proved his 
mighty power; 
lie stood upon the battle plain, as thousands did 
him fight, 
his emblem was our Stars and Stripes, his motto, 
" 
Truth and Right." 
Though treated bad by friends at home, he scorn-
ed the fight to yield, 
lie swore he'd win the victory, or perish on the 
field; 
He led his columns manfully, repelled each fierce 
attack, 
The battle was Antietam, boys, the hero, Little Mac. 
And. when the great Centennial came, each nation 
in this world, 
Did bless our glittering emblem, when its bunting 
WaS unfurrd; 
They came from Asia's sandy plains, from Afric's 
burning clime, 
From far Australia's lonely wilds, from Europe's 
sunny Rhine; 
They came to see the poor man's home, where the 
sun sinks in the west, . 
Where every wanderer finds a 
bed, and is with 
plenty blest. 
And when our banner bright went up, no tyrants 
flaunting rag, 
The nations all with joy they cried: " God bless 
the dear old flag!" 
66 ISN'T A DOLLAR ENOUGH TO BUY 
BREAD, AND WATER COSTS NOTHING 
AT ALL. 
An original song by FRANK LEWIS, written for HAnnv 
-Woonsos. 
In the city of Brooklyn is living 
A man, who himself once was poor, 
But that fact it would seem he's forgotten, 
Or he'd act very different, I'm sure; 
Now I 
heard, on a 
late Sunday morning, 
These words from his saintly lips fall: 
"Isn't a 
dollar enough to buy bread? 
And water costs nothing at all." 
Chorus. 
Then no man will I 
count in the list of my friends, 
Who is deaf to the workingman's call; 
And says: " A 
dollar is enough to buy bread, 
And water costs nothing at all." 
This wonderful preacher don't do much, 
Tho' he lives on the fat of the land, 
He has all that he wants—maybe too much, 
For he lives in a 
style that is grand; 
Yet this clerical and cheeky old fraud said: 
(Though two thousand a 
month is his pay,) 
That a 
workman should be yery happy, 
On only- a 
dollar a 
day. 
Then no man, etc. 
This man is not known for his good deeds, 
Though for "gab" the world over he's famed, 
He preaches to please his rich patrons, 
And thereby has gained a 
great name; 
But I'd much rather be a 
poor workman, 
When before judgment's seat we all stand, 
Than to be in the shoes of Ward Beecher, 
Who went back on the poor laboringman. 
Then no man, etc. 
WHAT THE OLD COCK'. SPARROW SAID. 
As sung by FRANK LEWIS, with immense applause. 
ONE day I 
took a 
walk, rambling thro' the Central Park, 
It was at the close of a 
bright autumn day, 
To enjoy the evening breeze as it swift sped thro' the trees, 
And watch the fountain's NA ater hrightly play. 
After walking once around, a 
rustic bench lfound, 
And sitting down a 
moment just t7) rest, 
When a 
voice I 
heard above, sa3 lug: " Soon to you l'llprove 
That honesty of purpose is the best." 
As I 
looked up with surprise, a 
strange sight met my eyes, 
Some fifty sparrows gathered o'er my head; 
A big cock sparrow spoke, with age his feathers broke, 
And this is wLat the old cock sparrow said: 
"'Tis strange such things to hear, we are getting worse each 
year, 
The laboring man now cannot get a 
meal, 
About fifty cents a 
day is all they earn for pay, 
It's no wonder that the poor man has to steal. 
And our parsons do not preach, or longer virtue teach, 
At secret kissing they are most expert; 
And our politicians all for their living shout and bawl, 
And talk of nothing but that bloody shirt. 
And our lecturers who roam, like naughty men from home, 
Through sleeping cars in dreams be blindly led, 
Like Tilton, sweet to furl his arms 'round some pretty girl!" 
This was part of what the old cock sparrow said. 
" 
To the demagogues who dare talk again of ciVil war, 
On the fourth of March 'twill be all right, I 
say. 
Boss Tweed is back again from that dirty land called Spain, 
And I 
hope that in confinement he'll not stay. 
For, supposing he did rob, no poor man wanted a 
job, 
He took it from the rich to give the poor! 
I'd rather run the risk, he ruled by men like him and Fisk, 
For then no beggars hungered at your door. 
Of such things soon we'll tire, look at the great Brooklyn fire; 
They condemned the theater—when the folks were dead! 
Had they done it but before, we should not the fire deplore." 
This was part of what the old cock sparrow said. • 
"In the election long since gone, none knows which man has 
won; 
They did the " counting" just themselves to please; 
Let Returning Boards act fair, and do things on the square, 
And we care not if it's Tilden or it's Hayes. 
But one thing we must see, in this land so great and free, 
That work in plenty shall be got for all: 
And the scoundrels who would lower the wages of the poor, 
How quickly we will send them to the wall!" 
At this a 
shout did rise, which ascended to the skies, 
From the sparrows that did flutter o'er my head: 
They said his words were right, as they flew into the night, 
And they voted'all the old cock sparrow said.

Away o'er the dark, rolling waves of the sea; 
They thought that a

Talk of this country and all of its glory,

And now to get back to her, tell me how can I? 
For surely it's one of those things I

It's no use to write to the old folks for money,

So pity poor Barney, the lad from Kildare. 
Talk of this country, etc. 
I'd work me way back on a 
ship if they'd let me, 
But fate seems against me, like death, cold and 
grim, 
For a 
man I 
was talking to, said he would bet me 
I 
would never get there unless I 
could swim 
It's awful hard luck that a 
fellow must suffer, 
That tries to be honest, and acts on the square, 
I'll have to turn out, be a 
gambler or " buffer," 
Then lookout for Barney, the lad from 'Kildare.

GO 
to sleep, my little darling, 
Rest on mother's loving breast, 
And the angels will protect you 
When within your cradle nest. 
Far above the starry heavens 
They are looking down on you, 
So repose, my precious darling, 
Close your tiny eyes of blue. 
Chorus. 
Go to sleep, my little darling, 
Rest your head on mother's breast, 
And the angels will protect you 
When within your cradle nest. 
Far adown the dewy meadow 
All the daisies are asleep, 
And the birdies in the branches 
Also are in slumber deep. 
But in Eden far above us 
Angels' eyes are open wide, 
And you are as safe, my darling, 
As if they were at your side. 
In the early morning-, 
darling, 
Little robin in the tree 
Will awake you from your slumber 
When he sings in merry glee. 
Then I'll take you to my bosom, 
Till the glimmer on the pane 
Tells us that the sun is,shining, 
And the day has come again.
