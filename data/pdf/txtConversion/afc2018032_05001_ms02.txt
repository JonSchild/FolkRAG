Summary of Interview: Gina Bryan describes growing up in Milwaukee within a family of 
educators. She talks about working as a nurse in an Emergency Department, which she describes 
as fast-paced and stressful. She states that she became licensed as an Advanced Practice Nurse 
Practitioner (APNP) working in mental health, and she went on to obtain a PhD in health policy 
to be an advocate due to the stigma that still surrounds mental health. She describes nursing as a 
privilege and a service profession that is a part of her identity.

Charitie asks a question about stigma. “I think it is a really good conversation to 
have because that word does get used a lot. When I think about stigma, in my role 
as a healthcare provider, what’s most relevant about that word is that when people 
feel stigmatized or marginalized, it gets in the way of them reaching out for the 
things they need and it also gets in the way of access to what people need. We can 
talk about stigma on a lot of different levels.” People who live with mental health, 
stigma as something being private. “When we talk about this idea of parity, 
whether it’s mental health issues, physical health issues, that there’s this parity 
between them, it’s a really important thing to argue for parity in terms of benefits, 
access. But when we talk about trying to equate medical issues with mental health 
issues, it becomes really complicated because we often hear people talk about, 
‘Well if you had diabetes you would take the insulin you need in order to treat this 
or the Metformin, so just like when you have depression you need to take your 
antidepressant.’” She says this is true, but more complicated than that.  
0.02.32 
You know the effect of insulin but not necessarily of psychiatric medications. It is 
less measurable than tracking blood glucose level. She says mental health is 
stigmatized because people don’t see it as physical or biological.  
0.03.50 
She notes stigma also applies to families and communities; stigma results in lack 
of resources. “There’s this idea that people ‘need to buck up, make the right 
choices, don’t use substance.’” There is more burden or fault placed on people 
with mental health issues.  
0.04.47 
She states that the correctional system is the largest provider of services for 
mental health. “Any educated health provider has to acknowledge that stigma 
plays a part of that. How did we get to this point? Not recognizing how stigma 
plays into that picture, how it unfairly puts responsibility on people in a different 
way from other areas of healthcare, that’s the danger of stigma.” 
0.05.27 
For advanced practice nurses, there is also stigma. “There’s this idea that it’s a 
second choice to being a physician rather than a conscious choice.” Still dealing 
with “turf battles” rather than improving access to care. True for all APNPs, but 
also stigma plays a part in mental health nursing.

She notes shortages in psychiatric care and in psychiatric nursing and describes 
changes in WI to address the lack in terms of legislation and education funding 
for mental health nursing and undergraduate nursing in general.

Charities goes back to follow-up with stigma—how does Gina combat it on a 
personal level. She talks about individual care that is multifactorial. In part, this is 
educating on the biological and scientific aspects of mental illness. People often 
can’t articulate their own experiences with mental illness, so her role, she says, is 
a lot of educating of patients. “Just because somebody says that’s the diagnosis 
you live with, is that the whole of you? No, this is a part and a constellation of 
symptoms that you have episodically at sometimes. This is a part of who you are, 
but not who you are.” She says there are genetic, behavioral, and environmental 
components.  
0.11.32 
She also notes that in addition there is a role for personal responsibility but that’s 
for any kind of health, not just mental health. “Behavioral change is the most 
difficult thing we can do.” She says we need both societal changes and personal 
responsibility. 
0.12.40 
Another issue is that provider appointments are so short now: medication 
appointment might be 20 minutes and that isn’t enough. The system doesn’t work; 
need to advocate for change. With shorter appointments, don’t have time to talk 
with family members or with schools, for instance. She describes this as 
“production models” of appointments, which hinders team-based care.  
0.14.20 
Charitie asks about culture and diversity of backgrounds for providers. “It is a 
huge issue; you look at the culture of healthcare and that has not always been a 
force for social justice, historically. So, I think there’s all the components based 
upon whatever community you live with in geographically and also in terms of 
socio-culturally what community you live in and that’s  heavily impacted by how 
your community has been treated by the larger healthcare organization over time.” 
“There is very clear evidence that suggests the more the healthcare team looks 
like the people they serve, and that’s a very broad statement, can mean a lot of 
different things, but the closer we resemble the diversity of the world we live in, 
the better health outcomes are.” Researchers, educators, and the workforce needs 
more diversity. She says she’s a huge advocate for that; diversity on every level.  
0.16.45 
She also notes it’s important to acknowledge things that you don’t know. Lived 
experience doesn’t always have to be shared exactly; don’t overgeneralize a 
shared experience. She uses the example of pregnancy. Important not to assume 
that other people’s pregnancies are the same; avoid over-identification. She 
emphasizes asking about the person’s own story.  
0.18.21 
She describes the process of holistic admissions at UW for medical education. 
[She shows me a website from UW]. Holistic admission moves beyond GPA and 
“leadership”—people from lower socio-economic backgrounds can’t always join 
clubs or extracurricular activities to develop “leadership.” They’ve been using this 
new process for about two years. [She reads from the Association of American 
Medical Colleges website, which is spearheading the holistic admissions 
approach. She does some googling for another term, attributes, that is central to 
the process.]

Charities asks about Rock County employment; asks her to describe the work 
environment. She works in the Behavioral Health division of the County; all 
counties in WI are required to offer mental health services. She notes it is a large 
program with many sites; she works at the job center in outpatient mental health 
services. She’s there one day a week as prescribes for the CCS program 
(Comprehensive Community Services). [Based on eligibility, CCS is a free, state-
funded program; applicants must qualify for Medical Assistance/Medicaid]. Rock 
County can provide job support, case management, skill testing/job coaching, 
therapy services. She sees people in Beloit and in Janesville. In Beloit, the site is 
also multifunctional; it’s a large community building. She describes the physical 
space; she notes it doesn’t look like a typical health services site in part because it 
houses many programs. This can affect comfort level. Public transportation is a 
lack in Rock County. People can use services across two or three counties, which 
helps with that transportation piece. CCS is legislative, so there are lots of rules 
and there can be some frustrations with it.

“One of the big draws to healthcare  for me and nursing for me was team-based 
work. I love that. It’s energizing for me. Psychiatry and mental health nursing was 
a big draw for me because I find it to be highly interdisciplinary. You have case 
managers, social workers, occupational therapists, physical therapists, job 
coaches, housing experts, food source experts and there really is a team-based feel 
to that. Mental health really focuses on communities and families as well. When 
one person in a family lives with any health illness it impacts anybody, but I also 
believe that mental health on top of that is also such a construct of family and 
experiences. When we live in a family, there are often experiences that touch 
multiple family members. That’s a real draw to me.” She does work directly with 
families in Rock County. There can be ethical and treatment implications working 
with multiple family members either individually or as a group.  
0.31.30 
Charitie asks about a memorable narrative or experience she’s had. She gives an 
example from the beginning of her career as a nurse case manager. She describes 
her role at that time including setting up medications in people homes, going to 
the grocery store, scheduling appointments and so on. “One of things I can’t 
express enough is being welcomed into somebody’s home to do that work. The 
insight you are given as a healthcare provider to be in somebody’s home is 
incomparable. You can’t ever see someone in the same way when you’ve been 
welcomed into their home.” She describes this experience as a privilege. She talks 
about a specific mom that she worked with who had long history of trauma with 
bipolar disorder. Being in people’s homes, “Those are the services we need to be 
providing.”  
0.36.00 
She talks about her role as a provider giving services to a patient, but also not 
hiding behind privacy legislation, for example HIPPA [Health Insurance 
Portability and Accountability Act of 1996], to ignore families. Privacy doesn’t 
mean we can’t interact with other people.  
0.37.08 
She gives another example of a family she has worked with more recently as a 
memorable case that has stayed with her. She talks about working with an 
adolescent and siblings where she doesn’t go into the home but still has to look at 
various family and social services for them.

0.38.49 
She says that culture plays a part in how families want (or don’t want) to be 
involved. She worked in Native American services and this gave her some insight 
into differences in family and culture. She asks patients how they want her to 
interact with their families.  
0.41.00 
World Health Organization has named medication compliance as a huge issue. 
Thus, as a nurse, though she learns pharmacology, it’s also equally important to 
explore why or why medication is being taken properly. She likes nursing because 
she does get to ask these broader questions, which are the “historical foundations 
of nursing in family, community, advocacy.”  
0.42.33 
Charitie asks, “Who are psychiatric nurses?” and asks her to describe the 
profession. “When you fall in love with a certain area in healthcare … I don’t 
know that I can separate myself anymore without that being a part of my identity. 
Once you’ve been allowed the privilege of people opening their individual 
experience, their family experience to you, and allowing you in to some really 
personal … It truly is a privilege. For me, the identity of being a psychiatric nurse 
is truly believing and owning the fact that this is a service profession.” The aspect 
of  serving others is crucial to her; not true across all of healthcare. Some people 
and systems treat health as a commodity “to be bought and sold.” Emphasizes that 
her identity is not separate but wrapped up in psychiatric nursing; can’t separate 
her career out from herself.  
0.45.00 
She suggests that most people in the profession would feel the same way. 
“Nothing makes me happier than being with a group of self-identified mental 
health nurses … We do find each other.” “That’s how you survive and thrive in 
really difficult work.” Most of her days she listens to trauma, so she sees the 
importance of taking care of yourself, including finding people like yourself.  
0.47.15 
She follows up on dealing with stress: humor is really important and finding 
employment with a “shared worldview” and commitment to patients. Notes that 
junk food is her go-to when stressed though she knows better. “I don’t necessarily 
know that I believe putting in too much time is what burns out people, I think it’s 
putting in too much time where your ethics aren’t able to line up with what you’re 
working toward.”  
0.49.29 
Charitie asks about humor. Gina says that’s complicated; humor is subjective, but 
there’s definitely humor in healthcare. “Certain types of humor gravitate to certain 
areas, right. We know the more intense crisis units, emergency departments, crisis 
units in mental health tend to have humor that groups of people gravitate towards 
each other with similar humor base. Of course, there’s always an eye to respect 
and not insulting, but the idea that humor shouldn’t be used in certain settings is a 
dangerous narrative. Humor, it’s protective; it’s a shared sense of … It’s shared 
communication that people that live similar experiences are able to hear in one 
another. Again, there is strong evidence to suggest that using that is really 
protective.” She says it’s hard to give an example because it can be taken out of 
context; it’s used best when we’re laughing at ourselves. Talks about lists that you 
see on social media: what it means to be an emergency room nurse.  
0.51.26 
“One thing that is true about nursing too, I really believe you see less ego. It’s not 
there in nurses because that’s not how we were trained, not’s not how we were 
educated. The history of nursing is that nursing took on, nursing is a job that 
Page 5 of 5 
 
requires a really high level of responsibility and a very low level of power.” 
People go into nursing for the service part rather than ego and thus humor comes 
in more.  
0.52.30 
She follows up on the issue of power she mentioned. She talks about research in 
economics of healthcare that shows nurses rarely have seats at the table, in terms 
of who business leaders go to for information about healthcare. “And what we 
know is nurses have the most facetime with the people we serve. So, there’s a real 
disconnect there. When I say, ‘low level of power’ it’s because we’re not at the 
tables that make the decisions.” This is slowly changing. 
0.54.00 
She talks about work in D.C.; she has a congressional appointment looking at 
legislation around opiates. Globally, nurses are being consulted more frequently. 
Need nurses for diversity of ideas.  
0.55.17 
She describes hierarchy in hospitals; CNO vs. CMO (chief nursing officer vs 
chief medical officer). “Who is making decisions for the organization and where 
is nursing in that flowchart? We’re not there yet.” Nurses need decision making 
power.  
0.56.54 
Among nurses there is a sense of community, she states. She talks about the 
different certifications for nursing. “It’s a really complex profession, but the 
general public, ‘a nurse is a nurse is a nurse.’”  
0.58.09 
Charitie asks about barriers or challenges to getting students into mental health 
nursing. She states the main challenge is getting enough faculty in the field to 
expose students to psych. A lack of clinical sites also hinders recruitment. Social 
media and popular press can help.
