BT: That mobile out there came from Hatteras and the old guy was 
in the barbershop and his son ran the barber shop. He sold those 
at $7.50. There's 2,4, what's there 8, 8 geese on that thing. 
NR: For each one? 
BT: No, for the whole thing. And the father always said, "my 
son's not much of a whittler, but I am, and he sold them and that 
was the last one's he sold. John McAnn bought 'em... Seashore 
Supply. He lived in G—New Gretna; 15GT, and he bought everything he 
had 
left, that the guy had Ieft.And he didn't whittle any more 
after that.... I've never seen anymore like 
it. 
NR: 
The mobiles or the geese? 
BT: 
Mobiles ... geese—mobiles!..like that, that were made in 
Hatteras. 
NR: 
But had he seen any geese—mobiles that were made 
in 
Barnegat? (laugh) 
TX02: BT: No, not in G—Barnegat; 42GT either. And you're talking 
about Barnegat ... I used to be 
in Barnegat when I was knee high to 
a grasshopper. They had a deer walkin' down the street, and he 
used to go 
in the Acme store and 
eat cellophane and carrots, and 
he were a buck, 
like old Charlie Linholm always said, "she were a 
buck. She were a big buck." 
NR: Oh come on, there was no deer in the Acme. 
BT: Um hmm. 
NR: When was that? 
JT: What he's saying 
is true, but he's being ornery. 
Rubinstein--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 1 
BT: There was a deer, that used to walk around, a buck deer, 
in 
Barnegat, Bar—ne—gat, and anybody says 
it wasn't is full of bull. 
NR: I thought it was a buck, was 
it a buck or a bull 
in Barnegat? 
BT: When I was about twelve years old. 
NR: You mean 
it just walked 
in there on 
its own, or? 
BT: No, somebody had the deer, 
it was caught in a forest fire and 
they raised it. I can't tell you the whole story, but at that 
time 
is when I used to go up there to Clayton's and tend gas 
pumps and we used to, they used to go 
in there to shop to buy 
groceries. 
NR: The Acme in Barnegat? 
BT: 
It was only a little bit of a store. See these people think 
they know about the Pinelands, don't know too much about the 
Pinel and s. 
NR: Why, because they don't know about the buck? 
BT: No, they don't know what happened there years ago. These 
people that are telling you today are not really Pineys.... 
NR: I don't believe that there's a buck 
in Barnegat. 
BT: Not now anymore, he'd have to be on Social Security. And 
if 
you want more information about that you'll have to go see 
Elaine...tell you about the buck 
in 
the Barnegat, goin' 
in 
the 
Acme and that's true. He used to go 
in there every day... The 
deer was caught in a forest fire. Somebody got the deer and 
raised it. She can probably tell 
you who 
it was and all about 
that, but the deer used to walk around the town of Barnegat, and 
he went in the Acme and they gave 
it different things to eat. He 
was there for two, three years. 
JT: Well 
it was somebody's pet. 
NR: A customer 
BT: No, no, no. Somebody that lived close, right in town there. 
NR; So it would just go 
in on 
its own. 
BT: Yeah. 
JT: They didn't take 
it with them when they went shopping. Well 
sometimes they took 
it there, but other times 
it just roamed 
around town. Elaine can tell you more about it than I can. I 
didn't live there. I was only up there 
in the summertime. There 
was pictures in the paper and all. 
NR: Did you see 
it actually in 
the store? 
BT: No, never saw it 
in 
the store. 
NR: Ahh, O.K. Another tall tale. 
BT: No, 
no, oh no, 
I'll tell 
you what I'll 
do with you, Nora. I 
don't know how much money you have available, but I'll double 
your money, and I'll win the bet. 
NR: How can you prove this? 
BT: I can prove it. 
JT: There are probably pictures.. 
narrative 
TX03: BT: Those other two decoys out there came from Mayor 
Maxwell by his son after he had died... The two on 
the post over 
there. He was Mayor of G—Egg Harbor; 05GT for what, eight years. I 
don't know, roughly. But his son gave 'em to me when he died. We 
used to fish together, net together, he was a captain on the 
Rubinstein--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 2 
tanker Puroil... for I don't know how many years. He retired from 
there. The other two brant above that came from Beach Haven from 
Bob Evans. They're all workin' decoys. They all 
been shot over. 
JT: Bill knows the people that have shot over them... John McAnn 
died shooting over decoys 
in Stratford township... 
BT: And do we have one of those? Aren't those brant.. 
NR: Was he shot? 
BT: He died of a heart attack 
JT: Bill was gunnin with him the day before. 
NR: And he was walking across? 
BT: To go to the duck blind, and he had a heart attack and he 
died....We got some of his decoys too... Would you eat your 
pheasant that's under the glass. 
TX04: JT: Would you like to tell the rest of your menu before you 
turn 
it off? foodways 
NR: Stuffed peppers a la Jean. 
JT: Meatless. 
NR: Meatless stuffed peppers a la Jean, fettucine a la Jean's 
sauce..Is this your sauce? 
BT: Oh certainly.... 
NR: Homemade carrots, home grown. 
BT: Home grown carrots, fettucine. 
JT: Taste them, and then let me hear your remark on that.. That's 
a secret recipe also. These are Pinelands secret recipes, a la 
Wilmington. (laugh) 
NR: Um um good. 
JT: Did you give the entire menu?...uh, corn on the cob, with 
melted butter... Did you say fettucine? 
NR: Of couse I said fettucine... 
TX05: BT: He's a decoy man. He's got some decoys by John Parker 
or somebody... Tell her about the gravel pit. 
BK: What's to tell? They want to shut me down. That's all. 
NR: Who? 
BK: Pinelands.

TX01: G—Warren Grove; 56GT 
NR: 
Is this where you were pickin? 
JC: Yeah, where the cranberries came from...(Jeep noises) There's 
one of your original cedars there, original cedars... that's about 
three hundred years old or better. I have three or four of 
'em 
in 
there. Now there's a slough goes through here which is wet 
bottom, another one of right in here, which is wet bottom, 
another one of 
'em right in here ... You know what a slough is? 
It's a little valley 
in the swamp. It's right here. See where the 
water flows through. Now that's an 
island right there. This 
island is surrounded by water. This 
is where I've been cuttin' my 
cedar out right here. (jeep noises) Now if you were around here 
in July, you could pick huckleberries right off the Jeep, which I 
had one party from the Pinelands here one summer and she, and I 
had to stop and she wanted to eat huckleberries, like they'd be 
right there on the bush. Now this 
is an island. And the slough 
goes through there. 
In another words, the island 
is surrounded by 
low bottom. 
NR: What is this called Jack? 
JC: That's huckleberries. 
NR: That's all huckleberries? 
JC: Yeah. All 
huckleberry brush. They use that for ornaments. 
There's people breaking that for ornaments. 
NR: there's another one that grows lower though. Is that a 
different thing or 
is that all 
huckleberry. 
Rubinstein--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 4 
JC: Well there's a low, a low, what they call 
the upland 
huckleberry. Only grows up about 16, 
18 inches. They're the 
sweetest berry there is, 
but they're hard to get; people don't 
bother with 'em. Upland blues they call 
'em. 
NR: Are blues and huckleberries different? 
JC: Well, there's 18 or 19 varieties of huckleberries, wild 
huckleberries in this area, and they all 
taste different. They 
grow in different areas, 
like the grouseberry will only grow in 
savannah bottom.... You can get your car in here, couldn't you, 
Nora? You think you can drive your car 
in here? 
NR: Oh sure! 
(joke) 
(We were driving through deep mud and standing water about 4-5 
inches deep.) 
JC: All 
right, now see that water we just went through? That 
separates that island from this island. Now this 
is another 
island surrounded by water. 
NR: How can you tell 
that it's a slough and not just a wet spot? 
JC: Well, It's low all 
the way around it. Altogether different 
bottom. See that rain we had the other day ... last week this was 
perfectly dry. The rain we had the other day has put some water 
in here. This is my working ground 
in here now. I'm gonna explain 
to you a few things on how we operate in a little while. Go as 
far as we go and turn around. (Jeep shuts off) (We got out and 
went to the side of a small stream.) 
JC: 
I'll 
show you what a slough is ... Well this is my hangout 
here, where I cut my cedar here... different sizes, you notice, 
you see all size cedar in the area. The perimeter of this island, 
is 
I'll 
take you back here and show you what a slough looks like 
and 
it's a haven for our local ducks, the black duck and the 
mallard. That's their breeding area. The best breeding area here 
for ducks on the east end of the Pine Barrens. (5 minutes) ... A 
wood duck will 
live 
in 
the swamp, but they breed 
in the upland. 
they'll nest in oak trees 
in the upland. Now there's your slough 
And 
in the spring of the year, all 
you hear is ducks cackling in 
here with their young...It's all 
part of the Oswego branch, or 
the north branch of the Wading River. It's called the Oswego 
Swamp all 
the way to the Oswego Lake and from there it's the 
Wading River...flowing toward Sim Place toward the Southwest. Now 
I'm waiting for this thing to freeze up this winter 
so I can out 
that cedar. That's why I opened this up. 
NR: Does this island have a name? 
JC: No, no, not that I know of. 
NR: You never named 
it yourself? 
JC: No, no, but it's my island, and I'm pretty well attached to 
it 
NR: How long have you had this piece of cedar? 
JC: Well, I've been 
in charge of this property since 1934. And a 
fellow by the name of Gerber, Tuckerton and Mt Holly, had a 
business 
in Mt. Holly, a dry goods business in Mt. Holly, and 
in 
1949, he says to me, he's gettin' old, he says, "Jack, he says, 
you can use that property up there more than I can," he said. I 
was taking care of the property for him for the moss rights. He 
gave me the privilege of gathering moss on the property if I just 
Rubinstein--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 5 
took care of 
it and watched it, watched his cranberry bogs, 
watched his dams. Those dams there, 
if they had a hole into 
it, 
fill 
it up, and 
in 
1949 he says, he says,"Jack," he says, 
"I 
think it's a good idea for you to purchase that property. You 
could use 
it better 'n I can." I says, Abe was his name, I says, 
"Abe, I couldn't afford it, 
afford a piece of property like 
that." He says, "you know, he says, that's what I said when I 
first went in business," He says, "my father and I didn't get 
along and I had to 
leave home, and I, 
saved a few dollars, and 
opened up a small business place 
in Mt. Holly and I borrowed 
money for that" and he said, 
"I think you'd do all 
right with 
this." So I said, "well, that's a big proposition for me to 
consider." He said, "I'll give you a week," he said,"I"ll stop 
in 
next Sunday," every Sunday he stopped at the house, wanted to 
know how things were going, you know, he said," next Sunday you 
tell me what you can pay me a year," So I .says, 
"all 
right," and 
I thought about it and thought about it and the following Sunday 
he come bank and he says, "well, what are you gonna do?" And I 
said,"you'll 
laugh at me 
if I tell 
you what I can pay you a year 
for it," He says, "you got it." And he 
let me have 
it for 4% 
interest on the mortgage. 
JB: He knew you'd work 
it and take care of 
it. 
JC: But then, just before he died, he said,"Jack," he says,"I 
made the biggest mistake in my 
life to sell 
you that property. 
that was just before the boom came on property. He coulda got ten 
to fifteen times more than I gave him for it 
if 
he kept it. 
"He 
says," you know, "he says, I made a couple of bad deals 
in my 
life, and that was the worst one. (laugh) " So he regretted 
selling it. I thought when he sold 
it he wished me 
luck and 
everything else with 
it and then before he died he made me 
believe that he done the wrong thing. 
NR: How old is this cedar, Jack? 
JC: Oh my gosh, that's over a hundred fifty years old ... over 
that, all 
of that. 
NR: When this freezes over, will you put down a corduroy road? 
JC: No, when it's frozen, I just drop it down and most of 
it'll 
be this side of the creek where I can hook onto it with a chain 
and pull 
it right out. And I got another big clump over there on 
the other side over there. 
JB: Looks like someone's been 
in 
the center of that. 
JC: That was cut off. I cut that off some years ago, but there's 
quite a strip over on the other side, and this is where I expect 
to get this winter if 
I'm able and that freezes up. 
NR: How deep 
is this? 
(10 minutes) 
JC: 
It isn't too deep. You know on the bottom, all 
this bottom 
here 
is stone as white as milk, gravel, stone, white sand, as 
white as chalk or milk. 
NR: You think it's more than a couple of feet? 
JC: Some of 
it 
is, 
some areas is more and some less. 
It varies. 
It varies. 
NR: Why 
is 
it that there's this one island around this cedar? 
JC: You'll find that all 
over. See what happened here? When that 
Rubinstein--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 6 
beaver business came 
in, 
they blocked that. 
NR: That's a beaver dam. 
JC: I had to get the state fellas to, you can see the gravel 
there, that's hard bottom, that's all 
hard bottom. You could walk 
through there with a pair of boots on, which I'll have to do 
if 
it don't freeze. 
JB: Does it get any more navigable further down? 
JC: Well you know where this comes out on Beaver Dam Road? Where 
the big pipes are. You know those big pipes before Hattie? 
JB: Where we fill the fire trucks? 
JC: That's right. This 
is the water that feeds, that goes through 
there. But this isn't the only stream. There are sloughs all 
through there. All 
fall 
in there. There's a lower drainage pipe 
below as you approach Beaver Dam Road. There's one on the upper 
one, and that takes care of the drainage of all 
of these. Some 
people call them ravines. We call them sloughs here in 
the woods. 
(Re. picture taking) 
JC: I showed you where the ducks hang out, now I'll show you 
where they breed. 
NR: Jack, tell me what savannah bottom is. You were talkin' about 
savannah bottom. 
JC: Savannah bottom is 
low bottom on the upland, where it's solid 
clay from the top of the ground down and no trees grow there on 
account of the clay. Clay gets hard 
in 
the summer time when its 
dry, plants just can't grow there. The only thing can grows there 
is savannah grass, just something like Indian grass. That's all. 
And you'll see a little scattered brush here and there, and 
in 
wet weather, you have to be careful how you drive through there 
because you can, you know, clay gets wet, gets soft, and you bog 
down which I did many times. 
NR: What are the other kinds of land?... 
JC: We have savannah bottom and we have the plains and we have 
the Oak bottom and the Pine thicket...plain old mud .... Loomy? 
ground? That's oak bottom, the best loomy ground that we have, 
that's soil, that's farm soil 
is called loomy. Now this 
is humus 
here.. That's only good for certain plants because that's not 
sweet, 
it's sour.. That's a peat moss.. There's Aurora Nursery in 
North Jersey. they used to gather that, they used to buy quite a 
few bushels from me for certain plants. Now don't ask me what 
kind of plants they are. I don't know. Plants that can't take the 
sweet peat, most of the peat that you buy in the stores 
is 
the 
sweet peat...comes from the Holland docks mostly...but this 
is 
different. Looks the same, but it's sour... 
NR: How can you tell 
the difference? 
JC: Because we don't have any sweet peat moss here. The only 
sweet peat moss we have here 
is oak mulch, and that's 
all. 
There's a layer about half to one 
inch thick that's all 
solid 
oak. The top of 
it 
is about two inches thick. 
If you grind that 
up, 
it's the same kind of peat you get over in Holland. Oak 
is 
sweet, but 
in pine it's sour. Pine is wild. 
It's no good for 
plants, pine needles. 
NR: So it's whatever is growing on 
it tells you what it 
is. 
JC: The type of vegetation gives you the type of soil, 
Rubinstein--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 7 
distinguishes the type of soil... That's not real spagnum, no, 
it's up against a stump. That's more like sheet moss. Sheet moss 
grows on the surface. 
NR: And where does sphagnum grow? 
JC: 
In water... 
NR: Now, Jack you weren't here with your nice white shoes! 
JC: Yeah. Last week 
it was dry 
in here and I worked with those 
sneaks right inhere. That's right. I cut some trees. I cut a few 
cedars here with those sneaks on. 
It was dry, perfectly dry. 
(15 minutes) 
JC: Now as I showed you before. There's another slough or ravine 
or whatever you want to call 
it going right down through here, 
and right at the edge of that is the duck breedin' ground, right 
all 
around through there ... and they're pretty well protected here 
in 
the breeding season. No one comes in here. They've been here 
for years...Now we have out here, between here and Sim Place 
Road, there's a little water, 
you know where the water is. 
that 
comes all 
the way up to the edge of the cedar here, and there are 
also egrets in there, but whether egrets breed in here or not, I 
don't know, but there's quite a few egrets there at times... 
Yeah, there's some deer in here. 
(In the background the booming noises are the bombs from the 
nearby bombing range) 
JB: Nora asked if they hunt the ducks 
They don't hunt any ducks 
in there? 
JC: Right now, they do. I was working over on the other side, and 
there was some shooting in here the other day ... Well those 
boys,..they come in here and hunt 
JB: 
Iocal...Well maybe she meant down from the city... 
JC: No, the only people that hunt here from the gunning clubs 
that come from outside are in deer season time. Then you'll see 
people all 
over the woods. 
JB: But during the duck season it seems to be.. 
JC: No, 
no. 
NR: Do they have to get permission from you to hunt on this land? 
JC: I never had anybody ask me for permission ... Gaw! I posted... 
When I first bought it I thought I was smart, I posted it. You 
know how long them posters last? They didn't last a month, they 
has 
'em all gone. They just tear 'em right off ... This is a 
separate deed from the rest of the land. This 
is a thirty acre... 
this was bought by the New Jersey 
Proprietary...West Jersey 
Proprietary. Gerber bought that right from the original owners, 
from Berkeley Carteret, the division that 
the...established...They had a dispute over a division line. They 
made one division line, then one party agreed to 
it, 
the other 
one didn't. So they made a second division line, they had a name 
for each one. 
They didn't settle that division line until a 
hundred and fifty years afterward, 18 ... it was the latter part of 
the eighteen hundreds when they derided the division line. That's 
called the Lawrences line. It starts from Beach Haven, north of 
Beach Haven, and it cuts east of Warren Grove, and all 
the way up 
to the Delaware Water Gap. 
JB: O.K. That would be that monument on Route 9, 
right there

JB: 
Is that Gerber 
JC: Yeah. 
JB: Brother? 
JC: His brother was Lippman. Do you remember Lippman? Well Reuben 
was on the other side, where Norman 
and uh, 
run the store, and 
his sisters, on that side. They're cousins 
from the Gerbers on 
this side. 
JB: Then there' 
off ice. 
JC: Yeah, He di 
carries the bus 
JB: Then there's the Gerber on the beach. 
JC: That's the same one. That's Norman Gerber that has the store. 
He had one 
in Beach Haven, but he's in very bad shape now. 
JB: Well there's one down there that had the stroke. I see him 
walkin' around 
in 
the store. 
JC: Well he's 
in bad shape. That's Norman. Very nice fella. One 
of the nicest men you ever met. 
JB: We used to buy a lot of work clothes, when we were workin on 
the 
line gang. 
JC: You take Abe, every time you'd come, 
gloves. Or "you need any boots? " "Yeah, 
used to peddle too. He had a station wagon. He'd peddle boots and 
water gear to the fellas over on the island. He'd make a trip 
there every week. Barnegat Light all 
the way to Holgate. 
He made a good living.

JC: See here this young cedar in here? Beautiful crop of young 
cedar? This was cut off about forty years ago, I out this cedar 
off. Look at the nice young crop come 
in. Beautiful. 
Now we're 
gonna take a walk back here. 
JB: Got a pen with you? 
JC: Yes. 
JC: 
it's not very often a woodjin has a pen! 
JC: 
(looking at a track 
in the sand) That's a pretty good size 
deer there, track. 
NR: This is a high ridge here! 
JC: This 
is a dam. This is manmade. This is built. 
NR: Who built this? 
JC: Gerber ... I'll explain to you up here just what happened here. 
...He bought this property in 
1904, and 
in 1906, he decided to go 
in 
the cranberry business. And he cleared off...This was a cedar 
swamp ... you can still see the stumps there. It was under water. 
That's why nothing growed there anymore. And he cleared a hundred 
acres. There's another dam like this one over there, on the other 
end over there, and this was supposed to be all 
cranberry bogs 
in 
here...They never planted. It was never developed. Clarence 
Cranmer's father had charge of this at that time, and he had 
charge of the men workin' here buildin' these dams, clearin' off 
the area. Course the cedar was used there where the barn has 
fallin' down now, they cut lumber there with 
it and when they got 
Rubinstein--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 11 
on the other side of that dam, they cleared off another big area 
about similar to this and one evening they touched the heaps of 
brush, set 'em on fire, burn up the brush. And instead of 
leaving 
a man there after the thing was burned down, he sent everybody 
home, and during the night the wind kicked up and the sparks got 
out and started a forest fire. And this fire went out towards the 
John Cranmer place which was about two and a half miles west of 
this area. Before anybody could get to the mill, the fire got 
there first and burned the mill down. Then they got involved in 
two 
law suits between Conrad and Gerber and that between time 
consuming and 
expenses, 
legal expenses, 
it discouraged Gerber to 
procede to develop this thing. He just quit. He bought it 1904, 
1906 he started 
in and of course it took him about ten, twelve 
years before he got all 
this laid out the way 
it 
is now....The 
forest fire burned the saw mill. Conrad's sawmill 
in Barnegat. 
Remember the Conrads? Charlie Conrad, Conrad lumber. Yeah they're 
the ones had a sawmill out there.. They only fought fire in those 
days with fire. They had no equipment... 
NR: Jack what is this with the little berries? 
JC: I don't know...aah, sheep laurel. 
NR: Does that bloom like mountain laurel? 
JC: No, sheep laurel don't bloom.... 
JC: They're bayberries. There's bayberries with berries and 
there's bayberry brush without berries. I don't know if they're 
male or female or what. This 
is where the hunters come 
in for 
ducks. The North branch of the Wading River goes through here... 
They're ink berries, 
indigo berries. Here's one of my favorite 
roads here. Look at the 
indigo berries here. (plant) 
NR: Why 
is this one of your favorite roads, Jack? 
JC: Cause I work in this. See I cleared all 
that cedar out in 
there. And there's an underground stream goes right through there 
and boy that's deep. I had to put a wooden plank there to drive 
over...My house 
is right down through here. That's north. 539 is 
right out there, where you come in...(7 minutes) 
NR: How did you learn all 
these roads? 
JC: After so many years? You could be only a quarter of a mile 
from home and you're out in the middle of nowhere. This 
is 
the 
North branch of the Wading River. 
NR: Did Gerber build this sluice? 
JC: Yeah, This 
is 
all concrete and water flows underneath it. 
It's on a standstill right now, because over at Sim Place they're 
holding the water to put on the berries in case of frost. They're 
backing water up and this water can't get out. But the frost is 
chipping this concrete pretty bad. We've had a little frost 
according to some of the leaves, only 
in strips, certain 
areas ... It's always three or four degrees colder in 
low bottom 
than 
it 
is on high bottom... 
JB: Where's this go 
if 
you go to the right? 
JC: 
If you go up, there's another opening like this on the other 
side of that green cedar there, Then way up on the upper end of 
that other clearing there's a little dam. You cross that little 
da, there's a road turns off to the left and that takes you out 
to Short Hills where the stuff only grows about that high and you 
Rubinstein--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 12 
follow that it takes you out at the FAA station right here 
in 
Warren Grove off of Beaver Dam Rd. It's pretty brushy! Years ago 
when we used to use that road to go up there and get timber, that 
was pretty well open. We had 
it brushed out, but it's growed 
since then... The right 'II 
take you 
in the swamp. You can go 
straight, follow the road that I made to cut cedar out of, but 
then 
it dead ends back of my 
log cabin, back of mile pond. I 
didn't open any further because if I opened the road from the 
other side coming in, then they'll go 
in and steal 
the 
stuff ... (11 minutes) There's a half a dozen fellas that like to 
go pike fishin' because that's all we have here 
is pike and 
catfish. Now down through this stream, some of this main branch, 
the water is eight nine feet deep, and through the swamp there 
there's holes where john Mooney just brought me a pike about 22 
inches long. Boy was that good. Oh there's a number of people 
walk 
in here and fish off of here...That's the reason we don't 
make this passable here. 
If we made this passable here, every 
Tom, Dick and Harry would be 
in here...Cedar grows about one inch 
in 
ten years, and the trouble with cedar is 
it grows so thick 
that the tallest ones is the ones that survive. 
If the other ones 
around it can't reach the top, they choke out, they die out. We 
always leave cedar along the creeks for seed, and everywhere that 
I cut, when you get to the forks of the road, you follow 539, you 
look off to the left where I cut that cedar off 
in the last 20 
years, there's a crop coming in there, stands about this high, 
just as thick as grass. 
If I don't flood this, close these gates 
off and back the water up so I flood that, that would keep it the 
way 
it is, 
but 
if I don't and leave 
it as dry as 
it 
is now, twenty 
years from now, 
it'll all 
be young cedar coming up through 
there... Let the cedar come back again...These are the original 
gates. You open and close them by putting boards down through 
there. Have to run two poles inside that concrete and put boards 
down with slots into 
'em. But I give her free flow ... Cedar never 
rots out 
in water. They rot at the surface, where the air gets to 
them. I pulled posts out that have been 
in the ground for fifty 
years, and the bark would be on them yet, but at the surface 
there's just a little piece of heart. (15 minutes) You should see 
the size of the snappers we got here. See on the dam here when 
they 
lay their eggs...and the sun hatches those eggs out. 
(Discussion of stewed snapper). foodways 
That's a deer, big deer, that's two tracks 
in one, there 
used to be a track here and then he pushed it over. A buck track 
is split. A doe track is tight together. (sounds of pipe tamping) 
Now here's a crossing where they go 
in the branch there. Now 
here's where a doe went in there this morning. See the little 
doe, how they're tight together and there's one come out of 
there. They got an opening in there. That's what they call a deer 
run. 
(20 minutes) Maybe last night or this morning.... 
NR: What's the stuff growing up 
in the middle of that low place? 
SS: That's swamp maple. I can tell about the bark. (Discussion of 
the gravel put down on the old Tuckerton Road paralleling Route 
539 by AT & T) (25 minutes) This used to be a big lumber mill. 
Rubinstein--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 13 
All 
the gear is 
in that building yet. All the pulleys and shafts 
is 
in there yet, underneath. We're on the cable line 
in Warren 
Grove! Now these two buildings are recorded as old buildings 
built when Candlewood had a sawmill up here 
in Cedar Bridge, and 
that's where the slaves lived, 
in these two cabins. When Gerber 
bought this at the turn of the century, that large mill 
in 
Candlewood went out of business. They run out of cedar. They 
didn't have any more timber so they had to go out of business and 
the 
two shantys were moved here. And then the employees of the 
saw mill over there lived here, the ones that worked in the saw 
mill. They come 
in on Monday morning and stay til Friday night or 
Saturday. If they had to work Saturdays then they'd go home on 
Saturday night or Sunday, but that's where they'd stay. they were 
experienced saw mill men and some of them lived too far to walk 
or come on a horse. I know two fellas here Warren Grove who go 
away all week, and they worked up there at Lakehurst. But a horse 
it was a long trip. Now they drive Philadelphia, Trenton, 
everywhere's to work. (end of tape)

JC: Now this 
is the only original white oak left 
in the Warren 
Grove area. I don't know how old they are, but the only reason 
they're here 
is because forest fire never got in here. They 
always stopped fires before they got in. But this was the camp 
meeting ground and once a year 
in September they'd send word out 
to all the communities about Warren Grove camp meeting. Every 
community had 
its own camp meeting. And right over there there 
was a cook house, just a shed with a roof onto it, where they did 
the cooking, chicken dinners. And from that cable line where we 
just come through there was horse and buggies lined up all 
the 
way down on the edge of this grove, all 
the way down tied to 
trees. People came from Chatsworth and Tabernacle and Jenkins and 
Barnegat. Every town 
in the area would be here for camp meeting. 
They come on a Saturday and stay the night and go back Sunday. 
The last camp meeting that I remember was 1935 or '36. And the 
profit they made in those camp meetings was the preacher's yearly 
salary. (Mr. Southard came from Waretown.) Died a very poor man. 
And he used to come up here and preach and the only thing he'd 
get, he'd get a chicken dinner at Clarence's dad's place. The 
service was between 11 
and 12. He and his wife would have dinner 
the re . 
Amazing how those trees are holdin out as long as they been 
there. I wouldn't allow 'em to be cut down. There's a couple of 
'em there, AT&T run their cable through there and cut the 
Rubinstein--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 15 
branches off and they died off. They're here before white man 
ever come to this country, especially these here. My God it takes 
years to grow a trunk like that. You know as 
long as I remember, 
I can't see a difference 
in size 
in them. That's a fact. That's a 
lot of tree to grow. 
If 
it grows maybe a sixteenth of an inch 
in 
size a year, that's a lot. 
Somebody stole a bunch of cranberry boxes in here, half 
barrel cranberry boxes. I had a stack of 
'em and they stole 
nearly all 
of them. Now those pilings they go to Harvey Cedars, 
the bulkhead 
in Harvey Cedars, those over there go to Mystic 
Islands, and these over here go to Beach Haven West. (Re a square 
wood structure at the side.) It's a leverage horse. When you've 
got a heavy log, you 
lay that, put that a►ongside the 
log and 
lift the small end on top of that and push it down and load 
it 
up. Today they got forklifts for that. Years ago you had to 
figure out other ways. 
(Re. the hole 
in the center of one of the cut logs) Every 
once 
in a while you'll find one that's decaying in the heart of 
it. Most times it's due to too wet a bottom, too much water. The 
long ones there with a green top onto 
it, they're clam stakes. 
When the state rents out an area 
in the bay to store their clams 
then they buy those clam stakes and put around it. 
In other words 
mark out their clam grounds. And this stuff here 
is snow fence 
posts for municipalities ►ike Brant Beach and Surf City all 
those 
along the shore. They put these posts down and a snow fence 
around it to keep the sand from blowing away. There's bean poles, 
and a lot of this short stuff 
is used for fencing and dog pens 
and things like that.

and I traded properties with him. That house 
is built all 
out of 
construction planks. His bed 
is even made out of construction 
planks. Everything. Then he had a machine here and cleaned this. 
This used to be all 
cedar swamp. He cleaned it all 
out. He got a 
little dock there and a boat. It's only he and his mother. This 
is Plain Branch. I used to own all

JC: See all this red brush? That's the 
low huckleberries. Now 
this bush 
is "woodjin's enemy", sweet fern. They collect the 
sand ticks. Don't ever touch them in the summer time or you get 
loaded with sand ticks. In 
low wet bottom such as this, 
I don't 
think you dig down over two feet and you hit water here, 
is this 
type of oak. A common name for it 
is turkey oak. They have 
another name for it but I don't remember what it 
is. We call 
it 
turkey oak here 
in the woods. 
It only grows in a pine area where 
the water is not too far down from the top of the ground. I've 
taken several nature societies out and the latest thing that they 
make a fuss about is this wire grass. That's something new that 
they taken a big interest in. Do you know what this is? This 
green stuff? 
PC: I do! 
JC: Uvaversi.. we call 
it uversi for short. 
It grows only inside 
the bottom. 
NR: Somebody told me that the Indians used to 
use spagnum as 
diapers for their babies. Is that true? 
JC: Yup, I heard it too. I don't know how true it 
is... During 
the first World War, when cotton run short, they used spagnum 
moss and 
it served just as good a purpose. As a matter of fact, 
sphagnum moss 
is more absorbent than cotton.. You're walking on 
ground where the last Indians tramped before they left the area. 
(5 minutes) Look at where the fire went through back of that wood 
Rubinstein---83 Audiocassette logs 
page 18 
pile..Poor lookin' woodjins. See how that fire went up that pine 
tree right up to the top. Boy that must have been hot. Now this 
is where the village was right down here and right in there 
is 
the head of papoose branch where it starts up there between two 
hills there and there's a little stream of water there and that's 
where they got their water. And this is where they had their 
village (garbled) This 
is 
all 
chopped up ground where they worked 
it up. The ground raises this way, going up that way, goes up 
hill. This 
is 
on one level along the branch here. 
(Things that the historical society found) 
When I was a kid, I remember old man George Cranmer said 
they would come by his house on the way down to the bay clamming, 
the young fellas, about 120 years ago. I had a session with the 
chief priest or whatever, was over the house with one of the guys 
and I let 
'em have a piece of ground up along 539 where they can 
have their ceremonies, but there again they'll have to come to me 
and get permission and then gotta go and satisfy the Pinelands 
Commission whether we can do 
it or not... 
(Discussion of the filing of permits and the origin of the 
Indian population, and the ceremony) 
(More discussion of the Indians) (10 minutes) 
I'm looking for white rings. There were white rings all 
around the place but 1 bet that fire...Wire grass only grows 
where the natural ground was disturbed by people....

(Discussion of the closing off of the roads to the public under 
the Green Acres program and Pinelands planning, and of a recent 
article 
in the newspaper about New Gretna mayor, Floyd West's 
comments that there are now too many people using the woods.) 
ES: 40% of our property in Barnegat township between the wetlands 
and the Pinelands and the Green Acres are closed off. We don't 
get any taxes on this. The least we can do 
is use 
it, I would 
think. Because we have to pay the difference and the State just 
bought it up and that's the end of 
it. Why would they want half 
of our township? I mean, 
it's not fair... How much do they have 
to preserve? There's millions of acres up there. Now they don't 
have to have millions of acres to preserve. There must be a 
hundred by a hundred miles up there, that they could preserve in 
the pristine area which 
is the real Pinelands, here is not the 
Pinelands. The Pinelands are what they used to call the Plains, 
and always when they discussed what they were gonna do, where 
they were gonna go, they were gonna stop at 539, because that's 
the end of the Pinelands, west of 539. For years and years people 
have been coming from Rutgers ever since 1930 that I know of. 
They had bus loads of kids come down here and walk through the 
Plains, they used to call 
it. 
And try to decide why nothing ever 
grew, whether it was lack of water or whether it was the forest 
fire coming through, what the problem was, you know. And 
everybody talked about the plains. Well now there were thousands 
of acres and there's not a thing 
in those thousands of acres and

they want to take it and fence 
it off and keep it nobody would care. 
If there's anybody that 
owns it. That's good for the military cause there's no other use 
in the world for it... 
JS: They (the military) do more damage than the people here. They 
had a big fire last year.. last spring. 
ES: They always cause fires 
in there. 
JS: They have a range over there, you know.

so dry and so windy...they start one almost every year. But I 
don't think anybody objects to 
it.

JS: The county line.

JS: Close your eyes.. 
ES: You know you're in Ocean County.. Well that's where Barnegat 
starts. It's 18 square miles. We have no 
industry. The only thing 
we have 
is the bay, where they clam,.. 
JS: Our industry is kids. 
ES: And we have about five restaurants which they soak like mad, 
we have about gravel pits which they soak like mad, and we have a 
lot of little businesses, but you can't charge them anything, 
because.. We have gone from, 
in 1973 we had 1040 people. Now we 
have just about 10,000, 
in ten years. Ten times! We built two 
schools, we're building a high school and we have another one to 
build. (They're settling in) Settler's Landing.. on both sides of 
the Parkway because of the access. Well they have to work 
somewhere else, because there's nothing for them to do. 
If you 
don't work for the county , the township or the State, they have 
to go north or they have to go to Trenton or Philly. There's 
nothing for them to do other than work for the casino, but they 
still have to be fifty miles from the Parkway. They have to be 
near the Parkway.

(discussion of the possibility of building for their daughter on 
their land) 
(lack of services, and the Pinelands regulations) 
(inability to sell because of the regulations) 
(jurisdiction) 
ES: This whole area is under strict control and to me that's not 
a democracy. They tell 
you how many houses you can build, 
in 
the 
next section. They tell 
you how many houses you have to build in 
the next section. In other words we have a density area where 
they say you have to put four on an acre. We don't have any place 
in our town to put four on an acre, but of course it goes back to 
that thing 
in Mount Laurel decision where you have to have poor 
housing. We already have poor housing. I think there isn't any 
town 
in 
the whole state of New Jersey that has more poor housing 
per capita than we do. Our houses all 
sell for thirty five 
thousand. Now that's pretty poor, and yet they say we have to 
build more, and I said, no way. I sat on the Planning Board for 
about ten years, and I was the Chairman, and I said, No way are 
we going to have more. But then they said we won't approve your 
plan. We said, well 
go ahead, you're gonna do anything you want 
to do anyhow... 
(discussion of Pinelands Commission people) 
179 — 235 
(Their history in the area) 
ES: 
I've lived here since 1930. 
JS: They laughed at us when we built our place thirty years ago 
ES: People in the town said what do you want to build out there 
Rubinstein--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 22 
for. They didn't even know where it was. When my father built 
here, they said, well 
if you can find it, you can have 
it. 
JS: We built our place thirty years ago. 
ES: Daddy came 
in 
'29. We moved here in 
'29, We moved to 
Pleasantville. We 
lived two or three places. 
(I was) about six or 
seven. I was 
in second grade. We've been here now for say fifty 
years and 
in that fifty years, what do you see? You see us, 
and 
you see the house my father originally built and you see the 
gravel pit and you see the Log Cabin (Clayton's Log Cabin 
Restaurant) and you see the other house he 
built. .Now outside 
of that, there are five hunting clubs. My dad gave the ground to 
build on. 
JS: That was at least thirty five years ago..forty years ago. 
ES: And then there's three new houses and the old Cedar Bridge 
Hotel that has been there since 1700. There are three other 
houses built in the space of 
.. 
there's one up on the Plains, 
four .. 
and five. There's been five houses built in the space of 
four miles 
in thirty years.. There was no sale going on. There 
was no big development going on... I think 
it would have been 
fine. I think 
if every five acres you had a house, what would be 
the difference. They're not going to go back 
in the woods and 
build a house. They're going to build it along the road. 
JS: At least for 500 feet along the highway you'd have a clean 
highway. 
ES: Yeah because we go out and clean it. 
JS: The state doesn't do 
it. They look at it and 
laugh. They 
don't even take the dead animals off the road half the time. 
236 — 312 
(people from the Pinelands Commission as outsiders) 
(going to the meetings of the Commission and at the school) 
(Pinelands Commission members) 
ES: This 
is not correct. (Re. Pinelands Commission staff) You 
haven't been here. You haven't walked through the woods. You 
don't know anything about it. They said this 
is the way they were 
in 
1880 and that's the way it's gonna be, because it says so on 
the map. Every township had an ordinance for out in the 
Pinelands, and they had to have five acres or ten acres. 
JS: Anyone who's built out here, they bought the 
land, they're 
gonna live 
it. 
ES: 
If they took the plains, nobody would argue, I mean as far as 
those plains are concerned, they should be preserved... 
(re the jetport proposal) 
JS: Did you ever take a ride through this so—called Pine Barrens 
up here? It's really exciting, exciting as a plate of mashed 
potatoes. There's nothing there. You can't see anything. It's all 
scrub oak and scrub pine. 
ES: Honey, you would ride for miles ... We used to go for pine 
cones. When we came out we were just torn to shreds. 
JS: Try to walk through that stuff 
NR: 
Is that where you got your pine cones? 
JS: I did 
it all along the road. You had to do it along the 
roads. You couldn't 
walk through there, because you couldn't get 
in off the roads too far. Then you had to worry 
if you got in too 
Rubinstein--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 23 
far on a cloudy day, you had to worry about getting lost. There 
was nothing to get your bearings, within a hundred feet of the 
road. We didn't do that much pine. I worked in the woods for 25 
years. I was 
in the wholesale florist business. I sold oak 
foliage. I sold laurel. Birch. Sphagnum moss. There wasn't any 
birch around. I cut it other places. I cut a little over in 
Howardville. I'd buy the moss and re—sell 
it. They won't let them 
get that now. 
(discussion of the mossers) 
313 — 353 
As far as the 
laurel 
is concerned, 
if 
you cut it does it good. 
(discussion of the laurel) It comes out so straight.. 
ES: We could take you to places where John used to work, and he 
cut it, 
and there's a beautiful patch of 
laurel there. 
If you go 
somewhere where it's just been growin' for twenty years... 
JS: 
It spends itself after a certin length of time. And it's 
taking the livelihood away from a lot of people who used to make 
a living out of the woods, off the land. The Pineys used to do 
it.... We're Pineys. What is a Piney? 
ES: I have no 
idea what a Piney is. 
JS: I don't think they're any different from you or I. 
I know a 
lot of them. 
ES: People who were born here. Pearl Holloway is a Piney because 
her father was born here and his father before him. 
JS: Jack isn't. Jack was raised up north somewhere. He's like us. 
He moved into the area. I've been here since 1939. I came down 
here 
in 
'39 with the State Police. I was stationed in Tuckerton. 
(I 
came from) Trenton. At that time being a trooper we'd patrol 
up through Chatsworth and all 
through this area and at that time 
you stopped up at Chatsworth, nobody would talk to you. 
It was 
the uniform. I don't think they were that strange to outsiders. 
They were a little distant, but they didn't like uniforms. But 
today the younger generation. They're no different than you or I. 
They're educated. Very few of 
'em work 
in the Pines any more. 
There's a few old timers left, maybe 70 or 80 years old, that's 
still hanging around the woods with the younger generation. 
That's hard work. But they can make a living out of the woods. 
But as far as a Piney is concerned, you could walk by a dozen of 
'em of the younger generation and you wouldn't know they were 
Pineys. 
ES: There's a lot 
in Chatsworth that work for the county now.. 
JS: There's just as many strange people down along the coast in 
those days as there were 
in 
the Pines. 
ES: Back 
in Egg Harbor and Manahawkin, they were just as strange 
and odd as the Pineys. 
354 — 394 
(Re Piney label adopted by those from North Jersey or Phila.) 
ES: When we first came down here, they used to have their own 
laws, their own moral standards and values and things ... We 
didn't quite understand it. 
JS: They were clannish. 
ES: They were very clannish. If they were gonna do something, 
nobody ever found out. 
Rubinstein--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 24 
JS: They were stand—offish if you weren't born in the area. They 
didn't take to you. Once they did you were all 
right, but they 
didn't warm up fast. 
ES: They took care of themself ... Most of the people in town knew 
somebody else's father or mother or aunt or uncle. They didn't 
know anything about us.... 
ES: Everybody knows everybody. Everybody knows what everybody 
else did or didn't do. 
JS: 
It's no different in the city. You were stand—offish to 
strangers...

We

The kids are so destructive, throwing vegetables and setting 
fires. There's more poverty 
in the cities than there is here. 
There was a time when nobody got welfare. People wouldn't take 
it. 
The Piney was never in poverty . He could always make a 
living. 
If he couldn't make a living, he could go out and kill a 
deer, or he could pick laurel 
or get pine cones. He could always 
make a living. But they were never so poor that they would take 
welfare. I had a woman who worked for me and she wouldn't even 
take social security. There was a family of five and the girls 
were so honest that if 
you dropped a hundred dollar bill, they'd 
give 
it back to you. They won't go hungry. They could always make 
a living doing something. One fellow, whether he was cutting 
laurel or cedar, he would take these cedar stumps and with an ax 
he would carve a decoy out of them, take a pen knife and whittle 
the head and the body and 
in about 15 — 20 minutes he could make 
a rough cut decoy. And he used to 
make 'em for this place that'd 
sell 
'em 
in Manahawkin where the Clear Cable television people 
are now. There used to be a place 
in there that sold antiques and 
things. I don't know whether they're still there or not, but they 
would buy these decoys from them and make lamps out of them... 
They always had some old thing that they could fiddle away at, 
and he never worked for anybody but himself. 
383 — 400 
They sold laurel all year round.. cause I sold it almost the 
whole year. If things got rough they'd go out and kill a deer, 
and most all 
of 
'em had gardens, but that's a generation that's 
dying off.

ES: The local people can go down that creek without any 
interference. 
JS: I don't need any Green Acres. We've got 8 acres here 
I 
wander around. 
ES: And these people who know where all 
these creeks are, they 
don't need somebody from the Environmental Protection Agency to 
tell them where it 
is and how to get there and all 
that. It's 
these other people that they're bringing in who are messing 
things up. 
It's not the

186 - 250 
NR: How much time did you spend in the woods as a girl? 
ES: I spent hours every day. My daughter and John rode a horse 
every day, whether it rained, shine, snow, sleet or what... 
JS: We rode every day that was rideable. 
ES: At least an hour, an hour and a half. 
JS: Then Elaine and I when we were younger before we had a 
family, we had dogs. We raised cocker spaniels. We used to 
love 
to get out in what is Green Acres now, and wander around.. 
ES: Take a dog or two, 
let them run around. We'd be picked up. 
JS: Today, you take a dog 
in there out of season, I guess they'd 
arrest you. 
ES: 
It's now cut off from anybody's use, except a few hunters and 
it's a crime, because it's beautiful property, and 
it was never 
messed up. The people who went there appreciated the fact that 
you could go back. You know we had a gravel pit there and we had 
a big lake, about 15 acres, and the people would want to go 
in 
there and go swimming. Of course it was not open to the public 
and we never allowed it. They tore the signs down and you know 
what they would do? The first thing they would do was go 
in there 
and break beer bottles, all 
over the bank so that the next time 
anybody would go 
in there, 
if they did, they would hurt 
themselves. And we could never understand that. 
If they wanted to 
enjoy that, why would they mess it up so bad..? 
JS: People have no respect for property or signs or anything. 
(re. the current owners of the gravel pit and a drowning) 
251 - 303 
ES: We didn't have these problems before. Too many people. Too 
many people. (It started to change in)'73. That's just when 
everybody came to town. That's when they opened the houses. 
JS: Here's something that never should have been allowed and 
it 
was allowed, and now that the damage is done they're making laws 
and rules that it can't be done... 
If you go down between here 
and Barnegat, you'll notice that all the woods is cut off, just 
levelled right off (on 554). And 
in cutting the woods off, 
it's 
just branch after branch, 
is dead branches. If they have a fire 
there, there would be a real problem. The trees 'II 
come up again 
there, but meanwhile the debris they have laying around. 
Rubinstein--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 30 
ES: When we used to clear our wood, they had a forest fire ranger 
and he used to come around and he'd say well you can get a permit 
and you can burn at such and such a time and you can burn, 
because you would get an awful 
lot of sticks and trees, he said 
you can burn after five o'clock on such and such a day, but the 
DEP says, now you can't burn. They can burn, but you can't burn. 
They have big fires over there that make all kinds of smoke, but 
we're not allowed to burn our own trash. At the same time the man 
went around and anybody that was cutting wood, he made sure that 
they cleaned it up, and they were allowed to burn it... 
(about leaving wood debris and re—growth) 
JS: The oak trees 'II 
sprout up again, but it's gonna be an awful 
cluttered piece of woodland for a good many years until that 
finally rots and decays. 
In the meantime if they don't have fire, 
they'll be very fortunate. 
(re wood burning) 
304 — 403 
ES: That's where the old glass works were down there on the 
river, 
in Jenkins Neck... Harrisville glass works. 
NR: 
Is that a place you went to? 
ES: Oh no, but it's been there for so many years that everybody 
uses 
it as a landmark. 
(re the growing up of the bogs when they are bought by the State) 
ES: To look at these you'd never know they were cranberry bogs, 
cause that was fifty years ago... a swamp ... it's mushy. 
JS: The way they're all 
grown up 
it just looks like a piece of 
lowland, well, 
it's not even swampy... Most of the time they have 
to flood 'em and that's what they have 
the reservoir for. 
NR: Do you go back up there much? 
ES: No, you can't get there! 
JS: You can get in 
if you walk 
in. 
ES: But it's so far to walk. 
It must be a good two miles or three 
miles in there from where they got the chain. 
JS: The next road on the left... We called it Cranmer Place. 
ES: We called it Cranmer Place because there was a man that lived 
back there by the name of Cranmer who took care of all 
the bogs 
and they had five or six families living back there. 
It was like 
a little town. They had a store 
and they had a packing house and 
when the 
cranberries were ripe, everybody in town that could, 
used to scoop and came out and made two or three dollars a day. 
JS: They used to scoop 'em. They didn't flood the bogs like they 
do now... 
ES: And then the women would sort 'em. They had a sorting house 
and the women would sort 'em. That was Christmas money. And there 
was a man by the name of Henry Ford that lived back there. 
JS: There were three or four houses back there. 
ES: And Raymond Cranmer, Raymond's wife just died a couple of 
weeks ago. 
(re spelling of the name and the fact that they were 
related at one time to the Clarence Cranmer of Warren Grove.) 
They even had a little post office. They had a place where you 
put your letters and everything and the school bus that I went to 
school was a car. They took five of 
us and we always, we had to 
go 
in there and pick up two kids, and we always picked up the 
Rubinstein--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 31 
mail, and then we went into Brookville and picked up another kid 
and there was a big post office. The post office was right where 
the boy scout camp 
is now. There was a building and I'm not so 
sure 
it wasn't the building the boy scouts use, on the hill.. 
that was the post office 
It's still there. That was a post 
office 60 years ago. 
JS: I thought Al Royster lived there. 
ES: Well, he 
lived 
in there, but that was a post office. You know 
who had 
it was the Couch family. When we went to school, the old 
man, his name was Holloway too, Jack Cervetto's wife's uncle and 
he always put bricks in the bottom of the car, because we didn't 
have heaters. So we always had hot bricks for our feet. Wrap 'em 
in a towel. 
JS: My mother used to have these flat irons that you used to put 
on a stove to 
iron with.. Wrap them in a towel.. Anything that 
would hold the heat. 
ES: 
(I went to school 
in) Barnegat. We went into Cranmer Place 
and picked one or two kids up and then we went down to 
Brookville, picked another one up. Actually they should of gone 
to Waretown, but there was only one or two so they were 
in a 
different township bus. We picked them up because they were on 
the way...We had high school 
in Barnegat in those days. I went 
away to Drexel and I graduated and I came home and I taught. In 
Barnegat. Then when they closed the school I went down to 
Southern. They closed the high school the year our daughter was 
in sixth grade and she was the first class to go to Southern. We 
had kids from the beach. We didn't change. I don't think the 
township changed from say 900 to a thousand for ten or fifteen 
years. Somebody died or somebody else had a baby..,.

(At Harrisville ruins: This is where they manufactured paper in 
the 
late 1700's. (There 
is a pipe at the base of a concrete 
block:) That is an artesian well that's been flowing for years 
and years. About 2/3 of the building has been destroyed by people 
taking bricks and stone away from here for years. It seems like a 
smart move to fence 
it off. The fence isn't up very long. I used 
to walk all through there. You can still see some of the iron 
works where the power was made by water, and the outline of 
windows. They gouged it out and knocked walls down there. The 
village was in through here (indicating an area off to the 
right). 
(JB says he thinks he remembers wood buildings but could be that 
he 
is mixed up with the Batsto cedar houses.) 
(JC doesn't remember any houses. They were all burned up by a 
forest fire. There are remains of stone buildings across the road. 
The water went right through the building for the power, through 
the sluiceway that is still 
there. The red brick area on the wall 
is where the chimney was.) 
074 - 115 
(Jack was walking through the woods by himself) 
115 - 165 
Re. a sign "Closed for Public Use" behind the fence. Looking for 
another way in through the fence which has been up for less than 
ten years. Re. the village area. There's the road that comes from 
Martha and continues to Warren Grove and comes out at Sim Place. 
The Richards of Batsto at one time owned Stafford Forge, Batsto 
Rubinstein--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 34 
and Martha, and there's one road that they travelled from 
Stafford Forge, Martha and Batsto. It takes you out to the Green 
Bank Road and then out to Batsto. It goes right through there. 
There's a concrete slab alongside a big red cedar and I picked 
the slab up and I could see bottles at the bottom of a big hole, 
and he has never found it since. Grapevines choked the trees 
right out. Grapes and apple trees you find where there were 
settlements. 
166 — 205 
That's the road that goes from New Gretna to Chatsworth. Down 
here, maybe about four or five miles you'll fall 
into the road 
that goes from Green Bank to Chatsworth. It comes together. 
When we were here, a lot of this cedar seemed as 
if 
it was 
dying off on account of the grapes hanging all off, but those 
grapes are all weaved all 
through there, eventually will get the 
best of that tree.. old red cedar... (You can tell 
the difference 
between the red and white cedar because they have) different 
bark. You find very few red cedars that's that smooth all 
around. 
It's all 
grooved out. The white cedar is smoother... The red 
cedar is not fit for lumber. Too knotty. See the branches going 
up? That's all 
knotty. You might make a rifle stock out of 
it or 
a gun stock. There's enough wood for that, but not to... See how 
those grapes are workin around there. 
206 — 222 
(Red cedar is also used) 
to make hope chests... I never cut our 
local 
red cedar. White cedar is the one that really smells.. If 
you had a house with the white cedar, with our swamp cedar 
shingles covering it, that attic would smell cedar as 
long as 
that cedar was up there. The difference between the red cedar and 
the white cedar, the red cedar'II grow on high ground, the white 
cedar has to grow in water. You won't find any red cedar in wet 
bottom. 
223 — 290 
There was 500 population in Martha when it was in 
its prime 
between 1780 and 1850. (looking at a grove of trees in 
the 
distance) 
They're poplar. If you cut that down in six months it all 
comes 
up. 
(You can tell poplar by 
its) bark. Now maple don't grow like 
that. 
(looking at a tree with an elevated bark, that looks like 
miniature cliffs, growing vertically from the surface of the 
tree) 
I don't know what the name of that tree 
is. 
JB says 
it 
looks like some kind of a nut tree. 
Jack says it's not a tree that we have in Warren Grove. Now 
there's a maple. Another tree that you'll find where people have 
settled is wild cherry. There's a wild cherry tree over there. 
They'll only grow in cultivated ground. You'll never find them in 
the natural, 
like an oak bottom. You'll only find black cherry. 
We call 
'em choke cherries. Never find them in the woods. Now 
this looks like what we call 
rock oak. The rock oak has the same 
kind of bark. 
It looks like a rock. I don't think that's a rock 
Rubinstein--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 35 
oak. These are trees that are brought in here. They're not 
natural trees. There's your natural growth out there. See how 
scrubby that is. This stuff 
is 
all 
put here by man. You'll find 
them all 
over where people have settled especially on that road 
from New Gretna going down to Wading River. On the right hand 
side there was one place, very thick. They were right up there 
straight. Looked very pretty. You have some nice cedar here 
that's over two hundred years old. Red cedar don't grow very 
fast. Just like white cedar. 
291 - 308 
You come through here, I don't care when you get here, you'll 
always find people around here. Some with metal detectors and 
just scouting around. And they read about it 
in books and they 
come down. This area 
is the same as 
it was when, as far as I can 
remember. And I been around here when this was all 
open. Even the 
grass was nicer than this. There was a house right here. See the 
foundation. Most of the houses didn't have foundations. You walk 
in through there, I know you could find some relics, some parts 
of buildings, stone work and stuff like that.

(Looking at a plant with broad hairy leaves,

NR: We used to call

Looking at some small cedars: 
JC: That's the offspring of 
these other cedars...looking at a bare place on a tree, 
discussion of the marks of lightning, deer and man, mushrooms 
(called "plums"), holly tree, old wild cherry tree, grape killed 
trees.) A lot of vegetables and potatoes grew through this 
ground. (People were here before Jack's time.) In through the 
woods there's holes 
in the ground, with stone work kicking (?) 
up. This was all cleared at one time. That's sheet moss. I used 
to dig it up 
in six inch squares and put it 
in boxes and ship it 
to window dressers, big stores New York and Newark. The wire 
grass only grows where man disturbed the top soil. 
JB: And all around you 
is turkey oak. I have reason to believe I 
have been on that road. 
JC: The only thing I haven't found in old Martha is a cemetery. 
There was five hundred people living there, there must have been 
a cemetery unless they buried them up here to Jenkins. But 
there's a road right from Martha to Jenkins, but I never went to 
the south side of old Martha, down where the cemetery would 
likely be. 
081 — 125 
That's huckleberry there. You can tell 
by the Ieaves...All I ever 
found here was a plough share. (looking at an old road) I used 
to come here and hunt and at the same time look around. (finding 
Rubinstein--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 37 
a foundation) They tore all 
that stuff apart. There's people 
picking stones up all the time. When I seen it back in the 
thirties that was five, six feet high, stone work, you know. Lots 
of foundations and stuff...That's the remains of a foundation of 
a house. Can you imagine a living room being right in there, 
people sitting and talking? 
JB: Nothing about A—tom bombs, television or electricity! 
JC: They had a good quiet life. You think a person had time to 
start scratchin around he might find somethin other than stone. 
126 — 168 
On high ground it wouldn't be sphagnum moss. It may have been... 
NR: That's where the ground pine grew? 
JC: Yeah, princess pine. There's a crawling pine. Then there's a 
standing pine. What's that up there? Is that an opening? This 
probably was a garden for the people that lived over here, where 
this grass is.—That's a growth in short leaf pine, you find 
that. No that's something put there by birds or squirrels... 
169 — 207 
(Looking at a ravine or sluiceway. ) 
JC: That's man made though. Not natural. There's no swamp no 
stream at the head 
of 
it. That was made for a purpose, but I 
don't know what. (Last time he was here was 5, or 6, 
or 7 years 
ago ) 
(About having Jack included on the media tour.) 
208 — 233 
The middle of 
1800 was when this whole operation stopped around 
here... That's a deer stand — arrow hunters, deer hunters. You 
got a seat on the other branch there! 
234 — 326 
(Re how to get to Martha.. How rough is the road? Last time they 
had to move some trees. ) 
There's no water. Maple Branch where Maple Branch crosses the 
Marth Road is the only bad place and I don't think that you 
should have any trouble. 
(Looking at an area of blackened soil: NR: thought it was burned, 
JB said 
it was water related because it didn't smell burned.) 
JC: Everything turns black. Water turns everything black. That's 
starting to rot, decay. I think we turn black too! 
(laugh) 
(Deciding whether a log 
is cedar or not) (Looking at a perfectly 
shaped single cedar tree on the opposite side of the ravine)That 
could be red cedar. 
If there's no obstructions, they grow perfect 
shape all 
around. Look at that one! 
I used to cut those white 
cedar, where they had no obstructions and the branches would grow 
even all 
around, and I used to sell 
'em to Seaside Park, Seaside 
Heights... It's hard to find a decent cedar (for a Christmas 
tree). 
JB: My uncle, who's dead, was a great hunter. He 
lived 
in 
Massachusetts and he hunted, hunted, hunted, and he used to, 
there you could use a pumpkin ball. You can't use em 
in the state 
of New Jersey. You're not supposed to. He used to shoot the tops 
of the pine trees out... That's one solid bullet. 
JC: We call 
'em slugs.... 
JC: Christmas time, which 
is comin up pretty soon, you get in a 
Rubinstein--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 38 
pine grove like this and you start lookin at those tops... You 
bring your chain saw and ax with you, cause you have to cut down 
sometimes a pretty good tree to get at 
it. 
JB: 
(We used to wire some trees together,) using two or three of 
em. 
JC: I don't see a top around here that'd make a Christmas tree. 
JB: You know where they grew best? In the old gravel pits. Then 
they can grow 360 degrees ... See those little ones down there 
alongside the road. We'd get little ones like that 
and put maybe 
two, three together, and 
it would turn out pretty good. 
327 — 353 
That's a white oak. But the pin oak 
is one of the nicest oaks we 
have. They're a beautiful tree. I used to cut the leaves off of 
them... That's a short needle pine. And this 
is a cross pine

is a dead end. You turn right 
and that brings you up to where we were.

About 15 years 
ago the State uncovered the furnace here and 
there was beautiful fire box and the box was white as milk 
inside, and they uncovered it for people to 
look at. They got the 
bulldozer covered it up again and put a fence around it. 
(Looking at a hollowed out tree still standing) 
That's an ornament (looking at a piece of slag) 
I don't know why they don't have someone clean that dead fall out 
of there, 
leaning up against a beautiful tree there, knock 
it out 
of shape. Good dry firewood. If they ever caught somebody cuttin 
that up, they'd probably lock him up... What kills most of this 
stuff 
is the grape. There's people here all 
the time fooling 
around. (Looking at a squirrel or chipmunk den)

(Re. how far from he went as a child) 
I used to walk across the road and go through the woods there on 
a Sunday afternoon, Saturday afternoon.. I wouldn't go too far. 
The old gravel pit way back there, back of those log cabins back 
there ... (talk of the "lovers") Look at that red cedar in there. 
This one here is altogether different than that one, a couple of 
species of swamp cedars, now that isn't a red cedar and that 
isn't a swamp cedar. That's a freak. Now there's a swamp cedar 
here. Where there's water, there's swamp cedar... They're on the 
upland, not swamp cedar. 
NR: You know from that (at a distance) that they're red cedar.)

is... maybe a piece of glass, not bog 
ore.) I have some relics, pieces of 
iron 
in the shop. Martha is 
pretty close to the swamp. (Looking at a smoothed section of a 
tree, damaged by a "vehicle.") I'm surprised that there's no 
signs here. (Discussion of a metal detector)

TX01: 000 — 053 G—Warren Grove; 56GT 
We'll be on the south side of Oswego Lake. (trying to get maps, 
unsuccessfully) This is 
the Martha Furnace and this is the Martha 
Road. Here's Harrisville pond, and the Harrisville ruins. 
(Discussion of where we came 
in from.) Bass River State Forest, 
that's the forest south of Poor Man's Parkway. Here's the one I 
was thinking about, Calico. That's where we'll hit next. That 
used to be quite a town at one time also. That's closer to Warren 
Grove. That's Warren Grove Road. (How to go...) I think that's 
the Sim Place Rd... Stafford.. Warren Grove... That's the Sim 
Place Rd. Here's the reservoir in Sim Place. We're on the south 
side of Sim Place. When we get down here I'll 
show you Calico. 
Very few people know where Calico is. 
It's shorter going back 
this way than going back the other way. We'll go right direct 
home. 
054 — 083 
That's a bad road there out to 563. When we get out here at 
Brookville, there's a gravel 
road that goes right out to New 
Gretna. We turn left, we go over that bridge, over that dam, the 
Oswego Lake is, 
but that bridge is out of order. That would have 
been a much shorter, better road—The worst part of this road is 
from Sim Place road coming to the New Road, to the way that goes 
into Sim Place, the back way. You know where the Two Foot Road 
is, 
coming into the Three Foot Branch, gunning club? Two miles 
south of Warren Grove at the first woods crossroads, and there's 
Three Foot gunning club in there a couple of miles, Well you turn 
right and that takes you right into Sim Place, over the 60 acre

dam, and 
into the village... That's my gunning ground up 
in 
the re . 
084 - 125 
If you don't get your hands dirty, you haven't done anything!.. 
Old Martha! You've seen two forgotten towns of New Jersey... 
You're in the Wharton tract and you're in the middle of nowhere. 
Now there's the Wading River. You see it? Where that clearing is, 
that's all water. That dam there 
in Oswego lake 
is where they 
drop their canoes off and they come all 
the way to Harrisville. 
That's where all the bog ore came out for the furnaces, from the 
bottom of that river. 
126 - 175 
(Passing a hunter with a cap and gun) 
Is this the Martha Rd. This 
is the Martha Rd. We'll be 
approaching Calico after a while, you'll see some bare 
hills—then we'll see the huntin club.. then we come to Cutz's 
blueberry patch, then you hit the High Bridge Rd. They call 
it 
the Allen Rd... I came across an old barn, an old barn along the 
swamp, and I got about a thousand horse shoes around there laying 
around. Must have been an old blacksmith's shop when they were 
working this area. I never went back there... These areas, you 
know, you can stay away a few years and everything changes,... 
This 
is Calico right here, This is Calico. 
NR: How do you know that this 
is Calico, Jack? 
JC: Well 
it's clear. You can tell man cleared this ground over 
here. 
It was just a little village. People that lived 
in Martha 
or Harrisville, happened to 
live down here. 
NR: How do you know it's not something like savannah bottom, but 
is a natural clearing? 
JC: Just by looking at 
it, I know that's Calico. 
176 - 250 
See the roads..You can tell man worked around here years ago. 
NR: Are there other kinds of ground beside savannah bottom? 
JC: Savannah bottom, swamp bottom, oak bottom, pine bottom,.. 
What did Harshberger call one? Cirrus(?)... Like this is pine 
bottom here. Warren Grove itself 
is mostly oak bottom. Then comes 
the sloughs (slows)...Then they have what they call branches. Now 
branches has a little more water than the slough and they're not 
as ?. Like right alongside of the luncheonette, that's Dry 
Branch. There's always water in there...All branches flow into a 
swamp. (The road appears to be washed out) 
That's hard bottom. 
You won't get stuck there. You can see cars been going through 
there. This is a branch. (It's not a slough, cause) there's trees 
in 
it. A branch has trees 
in 
it, where a slough ... Now this 
is 
something you don't see very often. Cedar submerged in water. 
There's a blockage here somewhere...(There's a beaver dam)... 
251 - 290 
(sound of water running through the dam and of the car motor) 
291 - 401 
JC: That sand just washed out 
from that .. 
JB: 
If we get stuck we're 
in bad shape. 
JC: 
(Beavers) do most of their work at night (?) and early 
in the 
morning. I had a Didge four wheel drive truck once,... (story
