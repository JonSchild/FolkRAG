MF:  I been ehhh, since nineteen thirty-four I been using my garden here.  Before we used to use,
use my own, my own.  (F:  Uh huh)  I plant trees.  So I couldn't plant it.  They let, let me use the 
place.  (F: Uhhuh)  I had a man, used to be the foreman some years ago.  And uh I spoke with 
him.  And uh, he told me he was going to see what he could do for me.  And they, the electric 
light had the office on, on Market Street right across where the gas people is upstairs, in that 
building upstairs.  (F:  Umhm)  And he spoke with him.  When I went in there they uh, they 
knew about it already.  Then they uh, they says I could use.  (F:  Umhm)  And ever since that 
[unclear] becoming friends with them was just like a family.  They been good to me.  (F:  Uhhuh)
And I been trying to good, be good with them.  When I get these, this garden here, when they 
were putting the electric light poles for the, for Wang and for the hotel, wire the (--)  I, they had a
man from the electric light eh, what you call it eh, check and see if the work was right, going 
right.  And I had a, a wooden fence in the front was all broked up and everything, I spoke with 
them.  And he managed to, to get people with the electric light company, they put me a, a fence 
there.  They had that fence in the yard, was their own helpers there (F:  uh huh) that put that on 
for me.  And I spoke with them, eh, the same fellow and ah one time I was asking for something 
else.  I was (--)  Then uhh, he said, "would you do, try to do for, find out for me?"  Says, "Yes, I 
will."  When the next time you come around, came [unclear] from the office.  And he says uh, he 
asked him "what are you going to do with this?"  Before I could say a word that man that I asked 
[unclear] says "we're just going to beautify the yard."  Make a new lawn.  We been using this for 
about forty years or so, or more.  And he just want to beautify the yard.  And I thought, figure 
what I to do to make that man spoke for me, before I could say a word.  (F:  Uhhuh)  Make that 
word, that man's word as good as gold.  (F:  Uhhuh)  I said to myself, "what's more beautiful 
there as roses."  And then uh, I put the roses on 1880.  I start digging it, (F:  Uhhuh) put roses 
there.  Even one of the school teachers says, did you see that in the Lowell Sun?  Yesterday come
out in the Lowell Sun?  They're trying to make the prettiest flower on the national, a rose that 
pasts through the senate.  "No, I didn't notice it."  "[Unclear] a white lie."  [Both laugh]  I knew 
her.  I know she was a great person.  She retired.  She thinks she may come back.  I hope she 
does.  She say, I looked at her, "You didn't see nothing yet.  Wait till I get through."  Second year 
I plant more.  And this year I put that row in here and go in there to make it (--)  I want to put 
that and make it better.  Nice eh, that's a driveway.  (F:  Mmhm)  If ah, it's all in one piece, if they
drive with a truck and they back, they'll spoil the whole yard.  So I'll put a row of roses from 
there over, it's all private yard, looks good.  (F:  Mmhm)  If they spoiling that grass, that's a 
driveway, that's natural.  See?  (F:  Mmhm)  But that was an excuse.  So they made me put the 
rest of the roses that I wanted.  (F: uh huh, uh huh)
F:
Now tell me what you can about the Conne, the Connector?
MF:
About the Connector. 
F:
Where was it going to come?
MF:
They were coming right through here.  Electric lights, the school and everything.  (F:  
ohh)   Oh, the (--)  (F:  Right through this property here?)  That's right.  The last one the, that, this
road and that road, the side, on the other side was going, going right through.  (F:  Uhhuh)  Was 
going take the Armenian Church.  To go (--)  See.  And that's what they want.  They didn't mind 
you see, but uh, we didn't want it.  So ah, we had a meeting over, first time we had a meeting at 
Rogers School about it.  And they had the, the banks there that uh built that new bank from the 
Merrimack, where the Merrimack Mill used to be.  They moved from there.  (F:  Oh yeah)  
They're not there now.  They want it.  And eh, we have quite a good crowd there.  And then after 
that following week, that's when it come out in the Lowell Sun.  That, that wasn't mentioned 
there at all, but it come out on the Lowell Sun that should be decided through the registered 
voters (F:  Uh huh) all over the city.  (F:  Uh huh)  So for the Lowell Sun to put that, they must 
have had a, some meeting with somebody higher up, I don't know.  We, see.  But that's the way it
was.  (F:  Umhm)  That should, that should be decided through the registered voters all over the 
city.  So a lot of people they couldn't vote.  They wasn't American citizen.  (F:  Ohh)  Lot of 
people just came from across, they had their home, paid their taxes, they couldn't, they couldn't 
vote for their own homes!  (F:  umhm)  Trying to better themself.  (F:  umhm)  That's why I say it
took the people, the good people over the city to help us!  (F:  umhm)  [person speaks in the 
background]  We get together, see.  But it was the whole people all over the city to help us.  
Course we had the, after we had the last meeting on the [auditorium] to be decide, uh we had 
over, pretty sure we had over double votes.  That's when the councils vote for us.  When it came 
to the, for the councils to vote, we had the majority there.  (F:  Uh huh)  And eh, they gave it to 
us.
F:  And that happened ag-again?  There was a second time [unclear]?
MF: 
Now that was, this happened a second time.  (F:  Uh huh)  First time it was through just 
the councils.  (F:  Uh, huh)  See.  (F:  Oh I see, uh huh)  First time was the councils.  And they 
vote for us.  We win it by one.  (F:  Uh huh)  The only one was in, the only one was in and [both 
Connector] was Mr. Howe.  And both times he gave the Connector for us.  (F:  Uh huh)  And 
vote for us.  I was proud of it.  I'll never forget it.  So uh, you see, that's why I'm so happy.  And I
done it, and now I must think to do, I had to get them people.  That's why I'm not going to 
mention this on the tape what I'm going to do.  But you know what I want to do for them.  (F:  
Yes, uh huh)
F:  Um, would you tell me a little bit about growing up in Madeira?
MF:
Well where I come from, I come from as well up the country, a farm.  (F:  Uh huh)  And 
she comes on the village by the side of the ocean.  (F:  Mm-hm)  Come from class people 
altogether.  That's where they get the airport, and they built a new hotel right aside of where the 
land they belongs to, they selling it.  (F: uh huh)  They develop that, all that up place there.

picture big, (F: uh huh) and he painted and he gave that to us.  
UF:

that day.  And they have the, the hotels.  Half the hotel is in the ocean.  They make a wall around,
(F:  I see, uh huh) and around the wall you can see the, the ocean bank one side there and they 
make the hotel, the hotel inside, more inside.  (F:  Uh huh)  All together there.  They stopped

all the rights and controls everything.  And [unclear]  It was about, she controls three or four 
other parts from [unclear].  So uh, you see eh, they building lot of different (--)  People that live, 
go up there they build all the more houses in on the ledge right aside of the ocean.  See people 
used          to work the farms.  There was, they couldn't plant anything but grass for the, to feed 
the cattle, you know.  (F:  Mmhm)  The cows, you know.  They build hotels.  Tall eh concrete, 
just like here, steel.  (F:  Mm-hm)  They do the same things we do here.  They, they got quarries 
there, they got everything.  Now.  And they get a swimming pool, and they pump the water from 
the ocean right into the swimming pool.  [Interviewer laughs]  They're swimming in a pool of 
salt water.  (F:  Uh huh)  All the, all that land, all like that, they're all building, it's worth a lot of 
money.  (F:  Uh huh)  They build all different nationalities,  they're going up there.  All model 
homes.  
F:  So now it's become an international resort.
MF:
That island there, it's all model homes now.  (F:  Uh huh, uh huh)  Uhh, her cousins was, 
they always had a good home, better living than we.  We used to live out in the country, you 
know.  And uh, they have all beautiful homes up there.  (F: Uh huh)  What we have is not to what

for the, for the rest of the day.  [Unclear] (F: uh huh) hotels there.  (F:  Umhm)  In time it'd be 
much better to go and live there than it is going to Florida.  Flo--Florida today, was once quite 
private see, but it's no more privacy.  (F:  Oh no)  And eh, and over there it's cheaper to live on 
that island than it is in Florida.  And eh, and they're different people altogether.

She have a home for the rest of the days.  (F:  Umhm)  [Few words unclear].  The mother [few

Ohh!)  [Both talk]  (F:  And everything you've done [unclear])  When I was, I had another house 
there.  (F:  Uh huh) And I uh, when she came back here, sent for her in 1934, she wasn't, house 
wasn't lived in, wasn't good enough here.  She had to go and live over [unclear].  A woman used 
to mind our boy, our son.  It was three months old she went to work.  And after a week she says, 
I had a fellow that time was living with me, friend.  And she says "Jack, I says, "find a room and 
you can come and eat.  I'm going to live in here."  And it was raining.  Pans here, pans over there.
[Interviewer laughs]  I didn't want us fix the place because I want to, I didn't know what to do.  
(F: mm-hm)  See, I had a people living next door.  House where my son lives.  I didn't want to 
tell them to move.  One time she come over and pay the rent, it was raining.  She says "Manuel, 
you can't live in there."  Give me a chance to find a house around here for the children to go to 
school, I'll move with her.  She move over a block.  And we move.  Then we move over there.  I 
didn't want I tell them to move.  (F: Umhm)  And uh, [a few words unclear].  And I decides to fix
this.  They want me to fix a two tenement house over there.  But I want to get this done first.  I 
knock this place down.  I made--used to be a store here, old one.  Every time used to come in 
here used to rain.  [Unclear]   So we knock that down, reinforced that cement, made that cellar.  I
fixed this up.  We live in here, made a decent place here.  Made a place for my son.  Was, he got 
married, was living here for [unclear] about a year or two.  Then he decides to put up a house 
somewhere where he was going to live, was living there, they were going to buy a house.  (F:  
Um hm)  So uh, I told them, I says that uh, they [unclear] buying a house soon as they, they 
[unclear] it.  My son was thinking, you know.  (F:  Um hm)  So that's why the family, four 
generation living here.  I went to that school.  [Unclear].  
F:

MF:
Four, four generation went to that [Coburn?] (F: oh) School.  (F: oh, oh)  I'm proud of 
that school.  That's why I say I'm proud of that school.  And I left the fourth grade when I was 
fourteen years old to go to work.  The first school that I went to when I came to your country was
on Shaw Street where they built the church there now.  That used to be a school there.  That was 
the (F:  Uh huh) [unclear] School.  When I knock it down I bought some lumber [for that school 
right over there].  [Interviewer laughs]  And I built it.  See I was trying to get them, somebody to 
buy that, to clean that out.  That was the only piece of the South End they used to call the slums.  
South End.  (F:  Oh)  Old houses.  (F:  Uh huh)  Old [unclear].  Nobody wanted to take because 
thought the highway was going through.  They didn't know what to do.  And eh, we had every, 
most everything all set but that place there.  They used to throw trash, they use to throw 
everything in there.  And uh [Rodriguez?] was supposed to buy that and they back out of it.  City 
took it back.  So they, other people bought that church.  And that was built all of [unclear] labor.  
That (F: really!) group, they go around and help one another church.  (F:  Um hm)  [Unclear].  
That was all donated lumber, I mean ah, labor.  (F:  Uh huh)  I don't know about the material, but
it's beautiful.  You should see that inside.  [both talk]  
F:  Now which church that is?  Which church is it? 
MF:
[Unclear] the Portuguese church.  [both talk]
F:  The Portuguese church?  (MF: yeah)  Oh.
MF:
But it's Protestant.  Oh dear.  (F:  That's all right. [laughs])  Well anyways that is no lie.  
(F:  Uh huh)  And uh, I'm so proud.  I went up there and see them, talk to them.  I tell them the 
true.  I says, "I'm so proud.  Regardless of who bought this," I says.  That was here.  I could 
never say the South End was in the slums.  Because they used to throw trash here, throw 
everything in there.  And eh, but now, I'm proud to say there's, there is no more slums.  And I 
have something  to represent the South End.  And that people that they help us.  They save my 
home and the school in the South, homes of the people in the South.  They're roses.  There ain't a 
place in the city that has a better looking yard than I have.  (F:  No, that's true)  And, but they, but
they ain't got the yard that I have, all roses.  And I'm proud of it.  They can't call it slums (F:  no) 
no more.  (F:  No)  And I'm so proud I live to, to (F:  uh huh) be able to do it.  And I was eighty 
years old when I started, and I'm eighty-three today.  
F:  Today?  Is today [MF:  well, I (--)] your birth (--)
MF:

uh huh) September.  (F:  uh huh)  I'm going on eighty-four.  So I'm proud.  Ah, not only this 
place here, but the South end.  (F:  Umhm)  No more slums.  They can't call the South End, (F: 
slums, no they can't) there's no slums.  (F:  No, it's very beautiful)  And I'm proud of that school. 
I tell them, everyone, I tell them we may be working for the city, but you're not any prouder of 
that school than I am.  (F:  Uh huh)  Because I have reasons.  There was four generations going 
to that school, I'm the oldest.  (F:  Umhm)  And we're all living next to the school.  Can you tell 
me who should be more proud than me?  (F:  No I couldn't)  And I had them over there.  (F:  
umhm) I've represent the school.  (F:  Umhm)  Represent, that represent the South End, represent
all the people in the city to help us.  [Unclear statement].  You work is been, that's right, but they 
gave me that.  They're responsible.  Them people are responsible (F:  umhm) for what I done 
here.  (F:  Umhm)  What I have here.  (F:  Umhm)  I got this as a gift.  I said once, they call and I

She want to see me pull this through.  (F:  Umhm)  She was a great woman.  Daughters, too.  
But, but she was a great lady.  So that's why I says I'm proud, [unclear] she was a woman of my 
heart.  (F: mmm)  She fight [unclear].  She fights for the city and welfare of the city (F:  umhm) 
and for the people she represent.  She wouldn't let nobody tell her what to do.  (F: uh huh)  She,

make it come true.  That's Connector.  I heard that was (--)  I was working ninety-five Bridge

husband.  That woman.  That's something, that's something everybody should be proud of.  (F:

thing.  But he called me to pick what I want.  There's twenty-eight, there's twenty-five, there's 
thirty.  I picked the twenty, twenty-five.  (F:  Umhm)  So my mother went to work for me in 
battery.  But I was to do the work for my mother and help here take the cloth, because she 
worked too hard all her life. (F:  Oh)  She couldn't do that.  (F:  Umhm)  So my, I'm the one help

man, was the boss, the direction thing.  And we never see a Black man boss anybody white.  (F:  
Oh, uh huh)  See.  In Medeira, the years I lived there, fourteen years old, I come back up here, I

they eat different foods like uh, anything else.  (F:  Uh huh)  But those people have poems and 
food the same thing like what be in the United States and different places.  (F:  Uh huh)  But they

anything perfect.  [UF:  Holding conversation in background-apparently company dropped by]  
Well [few words unclear].  (F:  Uh huh)  When come spring a lot of people had a little work to do
in the house, [rest of comment unclear].  We used to keep him all winter here.  It was great to talk

F:  He knew your father?
MF:  And we used to talk.  (F:  Uh huh)  They winter he was here with us was great to talk to 
with a person like that.  [Comment unclear]  [Children are talking in background loudly, makes it

F:  Did you have brothers and sisters?
MF:  But that was a sickness.  (F:  Yeah)  When he start drinking, when he had a few dollars he 
thought it was, he had something while it last. After that (--)  But that was a sickness.  He 
couldn't, couldn't get out of it.  
F:  Did you have brothers and sisters here?

I have a sister here, yeah.  It's all the baby ones.  (F:  Uh huh)  My mother after eighteen years

F:  Oh, I know!  Yeah.
MF:  She lives right across, there's a new school there.  (F:  Yeah, uh huh)  Right the opposite on 
the corner.  (F:  Uh huh)  She lives there.  She's got a nice home, built a new home [unclear].
UF:  Okay Jimmy. That's my great grandson.  
F:  Your great grandson?  Does he live next door?
UF:  Next to the park.  Not this one there, the other one.  Not that one.
F:  The other one, uh huh.  
UF:  So (--)
MF:  And my son lives the next door and we live here.
F:  It's nice to have your family here.  
MF:  Four generation.   With me it's four generation living here.  
F:  Yeah, yeah.  
MF:  Since 1934.  
UF:  So that's, that's the way it is.  My father was a very good man and he turned so bad nobody 
could live with him.  (F:  Hm)  He lived up here.
MF:  He used to be with us a lot of time.  All the winter he used to stay here with us all winter.  
UF:  He was good.  He don't drink [unclear], but (--)
MF:  We tried to control him.
UF:  But somebody asked him to go do this, and give a few dollars, he started drink the same.
MF:  See it was the whole trouble his son was like I told you, well known.  He was a great guy to
do favors.  He was well known.  [Unclear]  He was well known all over.  And that was his father.
He couldn't say, argue with him, don't do this, or don't do that.  
UF:  But I argue with him.  (F: Yeah)
MF:  He didn't look, he never looked for himself, he didn't look (--)
UF:  I argue with him.  He says, "oh, you are bad today."  I started laughing and everything.  (F:  
Oh)  But uh, we all love him until he die.  (F:  Umhm)  We, he come up here.  If he was hungry 
he come up here and ask me if I have some for eat.  When I eat I always have his table.  
[Unclear] to go change the clothes, because he got a closet full of clothes, he never changed.  
See, that's the way it was, you know what I mean?  
MF:  His was wasn't living.  [Unclear] she used to take care of him all the time.
F:  She always took care of him, huh?
MF:  Clothes and clothes, even to the bed and everything.  (F:  Oh, uh huh)  Uh, she was uh, and 
uh, to tell you the truth she bought a lot here.  She used to live here in Lowell before.  She 
bought here a lot, a double lot.  We never knew anything about but my son, my grandson.  (F:  
Huh!)  Her brother.  She bought a double lot with intention that uh, both of them were going to 
be buried in the same place. 
F:  Uh huh.  And were they?
MF:  And they, we didn't know nothing about it.  
F:  Oh you didn't know?  Oh!
MF:  Of course not.  It was my son and his brother new at the time, they never would have told 
us.  After he died they found out that the papers on the attic, (F:  Uh huh) that they had it.  That 
lot was paid by the mother.  But it was too large.  And even when we paid the expenses for them 
to bury here, we pay for the lot and [unclear].  Nobody ever knew anything about but them.  
After they die we found out that she paid for the lot, two lots.  And I think that she wanted to 
[unclear] both dead they bury in the same.  That's quite a, that's quite a thing too.  Every women 
would have wanted to do what she wished to do.  But we didn't know nothing about it.  If we 
knew about it we would have had it done, them together.  We didn't know nothing.  
UF:  My father's up here buried up here.  My mother buried in New York.  Every, every year, she
died the same month as Johnny, Johnny Kennedy.  The same month.  
MF:  For twenty-two years she'd been going to New York every, never fail.  
UF:  1962, or '63.  (MF:  And uh)  And I go, go over there.  Every year I go over there put 
flowers on my mother's grave.  
F:  In New York?
UF:  [Unclear]  Yes.
MF:  If anything happens to her, to us, my son as long as he live, he'll go down there.
F:  He'll go?
UF:  Yeah.   (MF:  They were good to him)  Is uh, is a part of Long Island.  She buried in Long 
Island.  (F:  Uh huh)  Yeah.  It's on uh, (--)
MF:  You go in the outskirts, safe about an hours work, a ride to where they go.  (F:  Uh huh)  
They don't go right in New York.  In the outskirts like.  
UF:  Yeah, I take (MF:  short cut), it take five hours from Lowell to go there, and five hours to 
come back.  
F:  It's a long trip.
MF:  So to go to New York it's longer.  
UF:  Longer?  It's the same thing.
MF:  No, Umbelie, it's shorter.  John always said.  (UF:  unclear)  I used to go before.  And John 
used to always say by going there on the outside, outside when you go to New York.  
UF:  If I drive it's the same way, (F:  Uh huh) because we marked the clocks and the wrist watch, 
it's five house.  We stopped one time for breakfast, that's all.  (MF:  unclear)  
[Both are speaking at same time-cannot transcribe]
MF:  When Johnny says from New York to go there it takes about an hour ride.  [tape fades out]
