00:00:24 
Inspiration to be an art teacher: Wanted to be an artist not a teacher at first. 
Got a BFA from UW Madison, but bartended for three years after graduation. Debt grew and 
became unhappy. Needed to make a change. Through process of elimination, decided to teach 
art. She didn’t know what else to do with the degree. She learned to love it. 
00:02:41 
Preparation: Started at UW Fox Valley, transferred to UW Madison and earned 
BFA in General Art, with 30 credits in ceramics. Story about her inspiring professor at UW Fox. 
Returned to Madison to receive teaching degree – 2 years more. 
00:05:27 
Years teaching: 30 years. Subbed for a while first, then took a job at St. Mary’s 
High School in Menasha and taught for 12 years. Then, when she turned 40, reexamined her 
financial future (nothing saved for retirement).

Second segment: 
00:00:00 
Years teaching continued: Left St. Mary’s to sub in Appleton to get her foot in 
the door and wait for a job opening. Then hired at a temp position at 33%. Started teaching in 
middle school at first, but most years and experience in Appleton is at elementary level. 
Explains how temps got in line to take available positions in the district.  
00:03:20 
Typical day on the job: She says the job is like being on autopilot. She puts in 
only the time that she is contracted for (she is at 80% time not full time). Checks email when 
she arrives, cuts paper, flies by the seat of her pants. The best thing is when the students 
arrive at 9:30. Teaches from 9:30 – 10:30, then 10:30 to 11:30, then 45 minutes for lunch, 
followed by 12:15- 1:15, 1:15 to 2:15, then 2:15 to 3:15. She teaches at two schools. Collapses 
in a chair after the kids leave. No sitting down all day. Talking, constant attending to children. 
All output of energy and problem solving with student behaviors. Eats lunch while checking 
email , stays in classroom to store her energy for afternoon and prepares.

Typical class routine: All grades except 5/6 sit on the carpet, then she shares 
behavior expectations (PBIS expectations – be safe, responsible and respectful) and introduces 
the work for the day. Then students transition to tables, coordinate students according to 
colors, Lynn uses colors to assign student jobs. Students work, then time to clean up. All art 
goes to the drying rack, wipe tables, sit until dismissed to line up. 
00:14:51 
Grading and curriculum planning: She does not take work home, except 
occasionally entering student grades for report cards. She does not grade artwork. She grades 
students’ behavior, keeps a mental log of their capabilities. She orders supplies during lunch, 
squeezes grades in before and after class. Sometimes does it during class time. Her curriculum 
includes art vocabulary, doesn’t follow the district curriculum. 
00:17:30 
Relationship with classroom teachers: Regular teachers have had a ton of things 
thrown at them – they are overwhelmed. She is happy to help them – and will follow their 
suggestions to help integrate the curriculum. Shares a room with the music teacher. Music, 
gym and art formed its own collaborative team. Addresses the amount of hoop jumping and 
documentation required of teachers now. 
0021:24 
Professional development expectations: since the loss of the union, the district 
has the ability to do things without being questioned, to tell the teachers that their pay could 
be based on merit. This year besides in-service staff development, they have to do 40 hours of 
PD outside of school. Their decisions/choices for PD has to written down, explained, and it 
must be approved by two administrators. Only had 12 hours required before the unions left. 
00:25:40 
Relationship with principals: Most have been awesome. She speaks with 
compassion for the job that they do. Addresses how the state Governor has negatively 
impacted education. Tells a story about why her current principal was removed recently from 
his job. Strong team feeling at her school. 
00:29:08 
Relationships with other staff: She believes secretaries and custodians run the 
school, and it’s important to get to know them really well. 
00:30:15 
Socializing with teachers outside of school: Lynn is great friends with one of the 
other elementary art teachers in the district. Generally doesn’t socialize with anyone else 
outside of school. She would rather be home with her pets. 
00:31:55 
Things she likes about her job: Kids blow her mind with their ideas. She loves 
watching them make art and how every child’s work is different than the next. She loves to 
compliment them and loves seeing how proud they feel when they do well and loves to tease 
and play with them. 
00:34:08 
Challenges to the job: A few years ago, she hated traveling between schools – 
four schools in one year. She hated teaching then. She loves her current home school. Could 
use more prep time.

00:36:08 
Teachers’ reputation: Avoids telling people she’s a teacher since Governor Scott 
Walker took office/passed Act 10 (dismantling of unions). During the protests, the perception 
of teachers was in the trash. Tells story about the dentist’s receptionist – snide remark about 
teachers’ benefits. Made teachers out to be greedy. Lots of stay at home mothers really voice 
their appreciation for teachers. Modest pay -- $40,000 for 80% time. 
 
00:39:18 
Changes in education over the course of 30 years: Students behavior has 
changed more than anything else. They are less respectful, not on purpose – they just haven’t 
been taught how to be respectful in the first place. They don’t know how to be with and care 
for each other. No one has taught them or spent time with them. More integration of special 
needs – both good and bad. Disruptive students that aren’t mainstreamed in any other classes 
but art, music and gym. Changes in the family – high divorce rates and merged families. Art as 
a subject matter isn’t valued.  
 
00:47:45 
Advice to new art teachers: Keep an open mind. Be a team player. Don’t be 
arrogant. Be open to project suggestions from classroom teachers.
