Sleep, my baby, oh! sleep,

Close thy blue eyes little love,

Then rock-a-by baby on the tree top, 
When the wind blows the cradle will rock, 
When the bough breaks the cradle will fall, 
Down 3omes the baby tree top and all. 
Sleep darling while those bright stars 
Their silent watch doth keep; 
Rest, dearest, while the fair moon 
Softly guards thy sleep. 
Thy mother shakes the dreamland tree, 
Bright dreams fall down on thee, 
Sleep on, my darling, sleep, my child, 
My sweet one, dear to me. 
Sleep my child, sleep my babe.

A RECITATION, 
AS GIVEN BY MR. C. A. SAWN= UR 
HIS GREAT PLAY OF "'EARL." 
Only an orange, round and fair, 
Side by side with a 
beautiful pear; 
Both had ripened 'neath sunny skies, 
Where rosy summer never dies. 
Only a 
boy who had a 
dime, 
And saw the fruit from sunny clime, 
He ate the orange fair and round, 
Then threw the peel upon the ground. 
Only a 
peel a 
strip of gold, 
Lying there on the pavement cold, 
Waiting with tender patience sweet, 
The coining of unwary feet. 
Only a 
man amid the crowd, 
With head aloft and step so proud, 
Pride goes down before a 
fall 'tis said, 
It brought down low his haughty head. 
Only a 
yell, but what a 
yell, 
A 
word that sounded like to--well, 
The mission of that peel was o'er, 
But, oh! the man he swore and swors.

THE PATTER OF THE SHINGLE. 
RECITBD BY JOB HAIM. 
When the angry passion gathering 
In my mother's face I 
see; 
And she leads me to the bed-chamber, 
Gently lays me on her knee. 
Then I 
know that I 
will catch it, 
And my flesh in fancy itches, 
As I 
listen to the patter 
Of the shingle on my breeches. 
Every tinkle of the shingle, 
Has an echo and a 
sting, 
And a 
thousand burning fancies 
Into active being spring. 
And a 
thousand bees and hornets, 
Beneath my coat-tail seem to swarm, 
And 1 
feel the patter 
Of the shingle, oh! so warm. 
In a 
sudden intermision, 
Which appears my only chance, 
I 
say strike gently, mother, 
Or you'll split my Sunday panls. 
She stops a 
moment, draws her breath, 
The shingle holds aloft, 
And says, I 
had net thought of that, 
My son just take them breeches oX 
Holy Moses and the angels, 
Cast your pittying glances down, 
Ana you, good family doctor, 
Put a 
good soft poultice on. 
And may I 
with fools and dunces 
Everlastingly mingle, 
If .I ever say another word, 
When my mother wields the shingle. 
SHE DIED 
DIED ON THE STREET. 
a 
SUNG BY J. C. MURPHY. 
Dark was the night and the snow it was falling, 
Streets all deserted„the wind bleak and chill, 
Those who were happy were silently sleeping, 
Death in its mantle could not be more still. 
Hark to a 
noise—heavens, some one is crying! 
Some one to-night,is suffering, I 
fear, 
“Help me, oh! help me, 0! Lord I 
am dying,. 
Must I 
die friendless is noboby near. 
Caouns. 
Starving and crying, friendless and dying, 
Wandering about, but no friend could she meet; 
Cold winds a-teasing, her poor heart a-freezing, 
Heaven relieved her, she died on the street. 
Once I 
was young and as pure as a 
dew-drop, 
Often my parents were asked for my hand; 
Oh! no—no, never, they could not part with me, 
Mother thought I 
was the best in the land. 
When they were dying, for me they were praying, 
Heaven have mercy, I 
cannot help cry, 
I 
sent them both to their grave's broken-hearted, 
Now on the street a 
poor outcast I 
die. 
Chorus. 
Where, oh 
where—oh 
where is my Mary ? 
Long years have gone since r 
parted from thee;, 
Why did I 
leave you in grief and temptation, 
Death come to me and my mind will be free.. 
Man go away and sit down to.repentauce, 
To see your poor Mary it's no use to crave, 
She now roams in heaven where God will protect her 
Her body lies deep in a 
lone pauper's grave.

DEAR BOY. 
eIING WITH GREAT SUCCESS BY D1TSS QUEEN HETHERTON. 
AND LEW BAKER. 
I 
have traveled through life, I 
have seen many things. 
That surprised me in every form; 
I 
have been at the plow, I 
have been at the spade, 
'Till dark, and at sunrise in the morn. 
But at night I 
would go for some pleasure thro' town, 
I 
was always for pleasure and joy; 
My mother would say when going away, 
Be home early, to-night, my dear boy. 
CHORUS. 
Be home early, to-night, my dear boy, 
Be home early, to-night, my dear boy; 
Don't spend all your money to gamble and drink,, 
Be home early, to-night, my dear boy. 
One night I 
left home, and my poor mother was sink, 
In fever of torture and pain; 
She says, my dear boy, take the motto I 
give, 
I 
may not give it to you again. 
But when I 
returned from my night's fun and joy, 
I 
heard my poor mother was dead. 
'Twas then a 
cold chill through my body did run, 
When I 
thought of the last words she said. 
Om 
All young men that are here, take a 
word of advice, 
To your father and mother attend; 
For a 
good mother's love it must not be forgot, 
When she's gone you've lost your best friend, 
Don't spend all your money to gamble and drink, 
There are many things you can enjoy; 
Take the lesson I

Keep good hours at night my dear boys.

Across the ocean wild, 
To where your heart has ever been 
Since first you were my bannie bride.

'Your voice is sad when e'er you speak, 
And tears bedim your loving eyes. 
ON/01MS. 
take you back again, Kathleen, 
To where your heart will feel no pain, 
And when the fields are fresh and green, 
I'll take you to your home again. 
Totthat brisht home beyond the sea, 
MyiKathleen shall again return, 
And when the old friends welcome thee 
Thy loving heart will cease to yearn; 
Where laugh that little silvery stream, 
Beside your mother's humble cot, 
And brightest rays of sunshine gleam, 
Then all your grief will be forgot.

RECITED BY GUS WILLIAMS. 
The woman was old and raged and gray, 
And bent with the chill of a 
winter's day; 
The streets were white with recent snow, 
And the woman's feet were aged and slow. 
At the crowded crossing she waited long, 
Jostled aside by the careless throng 
Of human beings who passed her by, 
Unheeding the glance of her anxious eye. 
Down the street with laughter and shout., 
Glad in the freedom of " school let out," 
Come happy boys, like a 
flock of sheep, 
Hailing the snow piled v.-hite and deep, 
Past the woman so old and gray, 
Hastened the children on their way. 
None offered a 
helping hand to her, 
So weak and timid afraid to stir, 
Lest the carriage wheels or the horses feet 
Should trample her down in the slippery strut 
At last came out of the merry troop, 
The gayest boy of all the group; 
He paused beside her, and whispered low, 
"I'll help you across if you wish to go ?" 
Her aged hand on his strong young arm 
She placed, and so without hurt or harm, 
He guided the trembling feet along, 
Proud that his own were young and strong; 
Then back again to his friends he went, 
His young heart happy and well content, 
" 
She's somebody's mother, boys, you know. 
For all she's aged, and poor and slow; 
And someone, sometime, may lend a 
hand 
To help my mother—you understand ! 
If ever she's poor and old and gray, 
And her own dear boy is far away." 
"Somebody's mother." bowed low her head. 
In her home that night, and the prayer she We 
Was; " God be kind to that noble boy, 
Who is somebody's son and pride and joy." 
Faint was the voice, and worn and weak., 
But Heaven lists when its chosen speak; 
Angels caught the faltering word, 
And " Somebody's- mother's " prayer was haw&

WRITTEN AND SUNG BY CHAS. GLIDDEN, 
COPYRIGHT, 1881 BY WM. J. A. LIEDilt. 
Oh! I'll sing of a 
gall cut young man, 
He was born in the town of Cohoes; 
His head was fiat as a 
bedstead slat, 
Re used to wear 
shoes. 
His neck it was covered with scars, 
With freckles all over his tongue; 
His nos,i was hooked, his legs were crooked, 
lIt looked like a 
Lamp or u

CYMRU'S. 
But he catehea the croup while eating soap, 
And the thought he was a 
goner; 
He got sore eyes from looking at pies, 
In a 
gropory round the corner. 
He had a 1;ace like a 
Texas steer, 
Eyes like a 
soft shell crab, 
He had the glanders and yellow janders, 
They thought he would go mad. 
His head it was big as a 
drum, 
He was tongue-tied in t!!e feet; 
He fell through a 
ball and busted his 
And landed way out in the street. 
He'd a

And a

While shoveling feg he was bit by a

And they packed him home in a 
sack. 
Chorus. 
But his mouth got twisted from eating hot biscuit, 
And his lungs turned inside out; 
His eye- brow s grew on the back of his neck, 
And his te4li they all fell out. 
When he'd walk the street his back would squeak, 
And he always hail the blues;

Before we were married, you promised you know. 
We'd lead a

Nut since we are married I

I'm only your talkative wife. 
One evening while kissing she said have a

Now here at election I

But she keeps saying why did you do that?

She's an aligator face, and she's always on the brace,

I 
live around on Thompson street, 
Where Nigger babbies grow; 
If you happen to go round that way, 
big rocks at you they'll throw. 
They sit around upon the steps, 
And lay out on the rugs, 
And when they've nothing else to do, 
They punch each others mug's. 
There's black ones, yellow ones, 
Some the coller of glue, 
And when they tackle liver, 
You ought to see them chew; 
Their eyes stick out like onions, 
As up the street they sail, 
They'll paralyse . n

And pull the monkey's tail.

They'll make a 
black cat skip the gutter, 
As up the street they march; 
They'll sail into a 
Chinese laundry, 
And eat up all the starch. 
AThey'll wrestle with a 
big mince pie, 
Devour it at one bite; 
They'll make a

At twelve o'clock at night, 
There's fat ones lean ones, 
Walking for the.cake;

Was standing at the door. 
Her rosy cheeks they were so swat, 
Her eyes shone bright and gay, 
And on her bosom rested neat, 
A 
rose perfumed bouquet. 
I 
raised my hat she bowed her head, 
Soon by her side I 
stood; 
And then sweet loving words were said, 
That made my heart feel good.

Oh ! she's the sweetest flower hem, 
And she's the clearest of the dear; 
She's a 
lilly pure and true, 
A 
fragrant mignonette, 
A 
morning-glory dipped in dew, 
A 
purple violet; 
A 
tulip white, and red rose fair, 
The gayest of the gay; 
She's all the flowers sweet and are,. 
My rose perfumed bouquet. 
One day while standing by her side, 
I 
thought I 
would confess; 
I 
asked my love to be my bride, 
She softly whispered " yes," 
Her answer filled me with new life. 
It made inc glad and gay, 
To know that she would be my wife. 
My rose perfumed bouquet.

Now n 
a

One painted white and grey, 
I 
dwell in peace and love alone, 
With my rose perfumed bouquet.

THE BLUE ALSATIANNOUNTAINS: 
ET CIARkBELL. 
MUSIC BY STEPHEN ADAM. 
By the blue Alsatian mountains, 
Dwelt a 
maiden young and fair; 
Like the careless flowing fountains 
Were the ripples of her hair. 
Were the ripples of her hair; 
Angel mild, her eyes so winning, 
alga bright her happy smile, 
When beneath the fountain spinning, 
A-de, A-de, Ade, 
Such songs will pass away; 
Tho' the blue Alsatian mountains, 
Seem to watch and wait alway 
By the blue Alsatian mountains, 
Many spring-times bloomed and passed, 
And the maiden by the fountains, 
Saw she lost her hopes at last, 
She lost her hopes at last. 
And she withered. like a 
flower, 
That is waiting for the rain; 
She will never see the stranger, 
Where the fountains fall again. 
A- de, A-de, A-de, 
The years have passed sway, 
But the 33,7.... . 
mountains 
Elv:2 watch a wuit alway, 
A-do, A-de. 
The years have passel. away, 
r7.1.17, the blue Alsak' 
mountains, 
Seem to watch and 
lit alway. 
By the blue AlsOir mountains, 
Came a 
stranr,:: - 
the spring, 
-rind he lingerea uy the fountains, 
Just to hear the maiden sing, 
Just to hear the maiden -sing; 
Just to whisper in the moonlight, 
Words the sweetest she had known, 
Just to charm away the hours, 
Till her heart was all his own. 
A-de, A-de, A-do, 
Such dreams, must pass away 
But the blue Alsatian mountains. 
Seem to watch and wait alway.

And Jennie has left the old farm; 
To walk by the side of another, 
As on in life's journey they roam, 
And John who was tender and loving,

And left his old parents in sorrow, 
To suffer or mortgage the term.

In ways that bring evil and harm ;

To suffer or mortgage the farm. 
It's hard to be kveless and childless, 
When wrinkles are deep on the brow; 
And hair Sas grown aged and whitened, 
With footsteps so tottering now. 
But when we are feeble and helpless, 
With none to protect us from harm; 
We- 
only can suffer in milenee. 
Or tearfully mortgage the farm.

SAVE MY CHILD 
Words by Dr. Theo. D. C. Miller, Music by W. Warren Bentley. 
When the Steamer Seawanhaka was burning, d mother stool 
amid the flames, clasping her little child with a 
dying grasn, and 
holding it over the vessels side as far from the flames as pdssible. ; 
though fatally burned and exhausted, and knowing that her last 
hour had come, she held her darling one, and in pleading accents 
cried, " Save my child I" 
one of the heroes or that hour, and one 
whose, deeds will not soon be forgotten. 
MR. JOHN HENRY BUSH, of 
Harlem., N. Y. went to the ! chief of that agonized mother. Rowing 
his bolt close to the vessels side, he succeeded in taking the child 
allv, from the dying grasp of Cho mother. 
Ills Own person was 
severely burned, and altIviugh suffering intensely, was able to r 
cue twenty-one others. 
The mother died immediately after hof 
TOMO, and her darling one in two weeks. 
What wonderful love is 
k 
mother's love I 
Copyright 1580 and published by Mrs Pauline Lieder. 
Save my child, for I 
am dying, 
Cried a 
mother, soft and low, 
Where the young and old were lying 
In that, hot,r of gloom and woe. 
When Seawanliaka was burning, 
Drove its hundreds to the waves ; 
And that mother's heart was yearning 
0 
er the child her deep love saves 
CHORCT. 
Save my child, so low and thrilling, 
Came that plaintive cry again, 
As a 
hero brave and willing, 
Sought her side thr.,eigh fire and pain 
As a 
hero brave and willing. 
Sought her aide through fire and pelt. 
At the vessel's side she lingers, 
• 
Robed in fierce and cruel flames, 
Holding with her burning fingers 
Firmly all her fond beert claims. 
" 
Save my child !" if I 
must perish, 
For my hour has come I 
know, 
But tha dear one you will cherish, 
Tell me, stranger, ere I 
go. 
Fast the strangers boat is nearing, 
That lone mother and her child, 
Through the flames he r.ws unfeallag, 
Though it seems an act so wild. 
" 
Save my child !" and as she grasps it, 
That strong mother's love is o'er, 
With the grip of death she elaspa it, 
And on ettrth she pleads no more.

And when I 
die 
I'll leave you both,

My horse, my cow, my sheep, my plow, 
My home, my pump. my barn, 
And all the little chickens in the garden.

And every evening I

Her lowly face to see. 
And watch her milk her father's cow, 
In it I 
saw 11.;,4 harm, 
And lots of fun T'a always have, 
Before I'd leit the barn. 
Her father has consented, 
And we two will married be; 
Well own our little country home, 
And live in harmony. 
No sorrow seems to hover o'er 
Our little cottage home, 
For all is blithe and happiness, 
Although we live alone.

Memory gently leads me backward to the shores 
of long ago, 
Bright with many recollections dear to me; 
Happy faces smile upon me mid the breaking 
o'er the strand, 
Of the silvery surges made by memory's sea. 
Childhood's playmates cluster round me, friends 
of manhood's sterner year, 
Who have ceased the weary paths of life to roam; 
But amid the throng of faces there is one I 
treasure mosk, 
Of a 
mother whom the angels beckoned home. 
CHORUS. 
'Tis the- vision of my mother, she who rocked 
me when a 
bob% 
And who guarded me within my cradle nest; 
Earthly riches I 
would part with, just to hear 
her voice again, 
Of that mother whom the angels called to rest. 
,,V164.11661, 
She it was who softly murmured loving words 
above my heed. 
As she held me ere she laid me down to sleep; 
And through weary hours of danger, every 
effort gladly made. 
For my comfort, while she oft would o'er me weep. 
Faintly I 
can still remember songs of melody she sang. 
Prayers she offered that I 
might be always blest, 
But at last she left her treasure to the Saviour's 
watchful care, 
For the angels beckoned her to come and rest. 
I 
have passed those youthful hours and have 
grown to manhood's am 
Still my fancy often bids me backward stray. 
To the sunny days of childhood when the 
hours were sweetly spent. 
Wi:-
,h the loved one lying now beneath the clay. 
Childhood's prayers will have been answered 
when at last my life is o'er, 
And I'll deem myself forever blessed, 
Can I 
meet again and listen to the one I've 
treasured dam 
Whom the meals beckoned home with them to rent.

Hands all around, boys! 
Sweet music it was play'd; 
Arrah! forward four, we welt the lode, 
At Kerrigan's Masquerade. 
At ten o'clock, precisely, 
We had to close the door; 
b was crowded to suffocation, 
And it could not hold no more. 
There was ninety-seven couples 
Bound the hall did promenade-
1d Ireland was represented 
At Kerrigan's Masquerade! 
Kerrigan was dressed, I 
do declare, 
Regardless of expense, 
Re waxed his moustache up with soap, 
He fairly looked immense. 
Nis hair was tarred with axel grease. 
He had a 
five cent shave; 
a 
would make you die when to waltz he tried, 
The night of the masquerade.

MULCAHEYIS WIFE IS DRUNK, 
REOLCA.TION. 
BY JAB. RICHMOND, FOB REMY 
it o'BBIlitt 
The town is full of excitement, 
They dress in their Sunday clothes, 
It cannot be a 
holiday, 
What's the matter no one knows, 
Business is suspended. 
The people all converse, 
It cannot be a 
funeral, 
For I 
see no coach or herse, 
The police all act suspicious, 
See the Mayor come this way, 
There must have been some trouble, 
For not a 
soul feels gay. 
Haste and make inquiries, 
Courage boy, have spunk, 
Colonel what's the matter ? 
Why Muloahey's wife is drunk.

Ther'es a 
dear spot of land far out on the ocean, 
The prettiest island that ever was seen; 
There's no place on earth that ac well suits 
my notion, 
It's the Emerald isle where the shamrock is green. 
Alas! the bold tyrant has taken possession. 
And driven our daughters and sons to exile, 
For no one could stand their tyranic aggression, 
And banished are we from the Emerald Isle. 
OnoRtts. 
Then its God speed the day that will dawn with 
our freedom, 
When the stars and the harp shall be blended as one, 
Then the poor of ould Ireland will need no help 
to feed them, 
They'll belong to the country c "ftve Washington. 
When I 
left my clear home ij 
poor heart was 
- breaking, 
Oh ! 'tis a 
sad moment the parting of friends, 
The tear-be-dimed eyes, and lie honest 
hand-shaking, 
Oh! that causes the stoute 
of hearts to unbend, 
But there are occasions when partings a 
pleasure, 
And one is in crossing the beautiful sea; 
Where toil is rewarded by friendship and treasure. 
In the home of the brave and the land of the free.

To all joys that may be; 
While be flies out to visit round, 
I'm left, to nurse the baby.

To slave from morn till night, 
While ht; enjoys the pleasures of lifer 
In a

little corn, 
Upon her little toe, 
And everywhere that Mary went, 
That corn was sure to go. 
It followed her to jail, one day, 
For Mary she drank rum; 
And now she'll have a 
chance to pare her corn 
For thirty days to eoure. 
Little Willie would read novels. 
And play hunter all the day; 
He wanted to be an Indian scout, 
No matter what you'd say. 
Re bought him a 
little pistol, 
And put on his father's boots, 
And started for the western wilds. 
To hunt the savage Utes, 
No more he'll need the pistol, 
There's a 
wreath upon his brow; 
The Indian's went to his funeral. 
Little pant arc vacant now.
