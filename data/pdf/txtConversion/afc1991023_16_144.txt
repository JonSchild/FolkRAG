ir%al Report 
Mal O'Connor (part-time fieldworker) 
Most of the fieldwork I did for this project was woods and/or tech-
nology related work. 
In almost all cases the people I worked with were 
directly tied to the land and gained their livelihood from it. •
very per-
son I worked with, as it turned out, also owned land and owned indepen-
dent businesses. 
They were all independent and self-reliant people for 
whom work played a very important part in their lives. 
T•'hen I began working on this project I was hoping to work with woods-
men, and that is just what happened. 
Mary Hufford had met a man who cut 
cedar near Forked River, Cliff Frazee, and suggested that I try to get to 
know him. 
Before I had a chance to meet him, though, someone put me on 
to Silas Little, a silV•culturist who was retired from teaching and work-
ing for the Forest Service. 
Silas' tie with the land is quite differ-
ent than the rest of the people I met. 
First of all.he is not from the 
area, but from New England. 
Second, he does not farm the land in anv way_, 
e.g., cedar or cranberry farming. 
He has worked, though, since the 1930's 
on controlled burning as a preventative measure against devastating 
wild fires, and as a way of promoting growth of desired species. 
Cliff Frazee was also an advocate of controlled burning, and he burns 
between 50-100 acres of his tree farm (pine) each year. 
As mentioned above 
Cliff also cuts cedar, and that is the operation I became most familiar 
with on this project. 
The cedar that Cliff and his son, Steve, take out 
of the swamps is milled by Steve at their own mill, and is then sold to 
people like Joe Reed, who makes boats. 
Cliff himself made many garveys 
in what is now his kitchen. 
His father was a fisherman, and Cliff prob-
ably would have stuck with oystering if the industry in Barnegat Bay had 
not died. 
Cliff also used to scoop cranberries until the wages were low-
ered due to the influx of immigrant labor. 
These many occupations were all part of a yearlyhchedule for Cliff, 
and not really different occupations at all when seen in a seasonal frame 
of available and profitable work. 
I think that once he began working 
for the state he cut out most of the other jobs, except cutting cedar. 
I 
think it is important, though, to see these apparently different kinds of 
work as interconnected, as variations on a theme. 
I went to see Bill Lucas, a cabinet maker in S. Pemberton, N.J., 
because Bonnie Blair had seen his sign on the road next to his shop. 
I 
did not know it at the time, but many of the people I worked with, e.g., 
Cliff Frazee and the Lees, knew Bill and thought he was the most accurate 
sawyer around. 
Bill works primarily with walnut and oak. 
People will 
call him up to say they have a tree that needs to be taken down and ask 
him if he would like it. 
If it looks promising to him, he will drive his 
truck over, cut the tree into logs and bring trb 
to his yard behind his 
sawmill and let " 
dry for a year. 
Then he cuts them into rough cut 
boards and stores them in a mortise and tenon barn that he dismantled, 
brought to his yard, and rebuilt. 
Bill is known to others as some-
one who takes his time, is very good at what he does, and is not in it to 
make money. 
He is very well respected as a craftsman. 
My interest in craft work, especially those indigenous to the area 
led me to seek out a man named Durofee who ran•his own glassworks. 
I never 
2/ 
did get to meet him, but I 
met the decoy and bird carver, a Piney, 
and his wife, a Clamdigger, who lived and worked next door. 
They 
turned out to be a fascinating couple, born and raised in the area, 
who felt pushed out of the area because of the way people and organ-
izations like the state government were destroying the ecology around 
them. 
It was the Carneys, along with Cliff Frazee and 
ttttlater ythe Lees, 
who began to put the pros and cons of state ownership in perspec-
tive for me, and how state ownership affected a town or township and 
therefore individuals in that municipality. 
When the state buys land 
from a township, like the Wharton Tract in Bass River Township (I 
think I 
have that right.),, that township loses a lot of money in 
taxes because the state does not pay as much as a private owner. 
Con-
sequently that township has to charge each of its members more or 
attract new private ownership. 
In the case of Forked River, Cliff, 
for example feels the town has traded the major tax import of N.J. 
Power and Light for the life of the bay. 
Why bring in a power plant 
if you are going to ruin the livelihood of a fishing community in doing 
so. 
The costs outweigh the benefits. 
The Carneys and Cliff Frazee both also mentioned the problems 
when the state owns a piece of land and does nothing with it. 
Actually 
they do do something, it is turned open to people and can be hunted 
over. 
The Carneys thought private ownership with government tax sup-
port, or higher government paid taxes on the land the sate owns would 
enable land to be left relatively untouched in order to enable the ecol-
ogy to stabilize. 
The particulars of these issues are discussed else-
where, so I 
will not belabor them now. 
Gradually, though, by this point 
in my fieldwork I realized I 
was working on a piece of the very compli-
cated puzzle we were trying to map on this project. 
I 
could begin to see 
the boundaries of the piece I 
was working on, and to see some of the ideas 
not included in that piece. 
All of the people I 
had spoken to so far were 
self-employed and owners of their own land and homes. 
Work plaved a 
major role in organizing their lives, and they reaped the benefits of it 
both* monetarily and in strengthening their ties to the land. 
I realized 
there were other groups for whom this was not the case, e.g., the Puerto 
Rican community; and/or for whom their were other organizing themes in 
their lives, religious perhaps. 
And there were people who lived in the 
Pinelands and commuted to work, increasing numbers of them, because there 
was a finite number of jobs needed to support small towns. 
The concept of 
the town and township as a unit, I 
now also knew, was very strong. 
What 
the town decided affected everyone who lived there. 
It was at this point that my field work shifted focus, I thought. 
Christine Cartwright, knowing of my interest in craft related technol-
ogy, mentioned the Lee family to me. 
Abbot Lee, she said, had invented 
quite a few machines used in his family's cranberry growing business. 
We set up a meeting with the Lees, but a few days before that meeting 
Christine was killed when a car hit her while she was walking to her apart-
ment. 
This tragic accident made it difficult for the project to wind down 
its work with much enthusiast 
4C threw a wrench into everyone's work, 
I think. 
Yet at the same timias"s•uch a straightforward and kind per-
son that her deathF.Ih•tot phase her in the least. 
It meant she would 
have a chance to be with Christ. 
And the people whom she talked with 
in the Pinelands, like the Lees, really took to her. 
So Mary Hufford 
and I 
went to see the Lees. 
(I didn't know I 
was going to talk about 
this at this point, but it seems to fit.) 
3/ 
The Lee family has been in the cranberry growing business for two 
generations. 
Briefly, my fieldwork focus had not changed. 
Again I 
was 
talking to farmers, of cranberries and blueberries instead of cedar. 
Again I 
was talking to members of a family business. 
Again I 
did not 
find out enough about the women's role in that enterprise. 
Again these 
were the owners of land and of their business. 
Again I 
was talking 
with people for whom seasonal work shaped their lives, and I think, has 
a lot to do with what they believe to be important, valuable, and aesthet-
ically pleasing in their lives. 
Abbot Lee is an inventor, as are many cranberry growers,Tom 
Darlington being another example. 
Abbot brought home to me the importance 
of technology to any enterprise (witness our archiving in the field with 
the use of the Kaypro II). 
Cranberry growers often need a machine to 
work only a few weeks per year, but it is worth working all winter to make 
sure that machine works as well as possible in order to ensure a good 
harvest. 
And a machine does not exist by itself, unsupported, floating in 
a sea of machinery. 
It is modified constantly by people like Abbot to 
do what he wants it to do. 
He is constantly messing with machines and 
engineering concepts in order to improve the farm and the business. 
The idea of messing around with trees and machinery, with harvesting 
berries, trees, or oyster, or clams, or sphagnum moss may be a good point 
at which to mark the intersection of my fieldwork and the project as a 
whole. 
I 
would like to simply mention in a list some of the important themes 
that I bumped into that seem to be themes of the project as a whole. 
The 
first is the theme of work, of messing around with the land. 
I do not 
think of this as work for money alone, although for the people I spoke with 
money, or rather business, was an important reason to work the land. 
Work 
here has to do with a different schedule, different timing, than work that 
is stands in opposition to play. 
That opposition applies better to a piece 
of the project that few of us worked on, one that includes bikers, four 
wheel drivers, and possibly hunters, i.e., people who use the Pinelands for 
"recreational" puposes. 
It may also include another piece of the puzzle we 
did not explore much, retirement communities and suburban development. 
Gun Clubs may form a link between insiders and outsiders, between work-
ers and workers/players. 
George Heinrichs, for example, who is a member 
and guide of the Nottingham Club in New Gretna and lives there also, says 
that you work more while hunting than you do at your job. 
He is a third 
generation garvey builder and works at a boat building company. 
As mentioned above one of the important reasons for focusing on work 
is that it allows us to get into the way people, many people, in the Pine-
lands not only spend, but organize their time. 
This also gives us a way 
to begin looking at what is important, significant, meaningful in their 
lives. 
It also gives us a contrast between those who operate seasonally, 
for example, and those who operate more on a daily. or monthly basis, one 
that is more familiar to most of us who are working on this project. 
One of the interesting features of the timing patterns of the farmers 
I 
worked with was their multigenerational perspective. 
For Cliff Frazee, 
for example, the life of a tree was an important marker. 
It takes at least 
fifty years to grow a cedar tree. 
When he tries to farm cedar he is neces-
sarily thinking of his children and his children's children'reaping the 
next harvests. 
Farmers I spoke with also broached the concept of preservation in an 
4/ 
0 
interesting way. 
Bill Lucas, for example, sees trees as having a life 
cycle that involves birth and death. 
A walnut tree, he thinks, should 
be cut before it dies and rots,+that way it can be enjoyed while it is 
alive and also be useful and enjoyed as furniture. 
Abbot Lee pointed 
out that the laurel needs to be pruned in order to be preserved. 
Things 
left alone will not necessarily thrive. 
Silas Little pointed out that 
pines will not necessarily be part of the climax forest in the Pinelands, 
if they are not farmed properly. 
But Abbot also pointed out that preser-
vation is a very complex issue. 
It would not be a good idea,either; to 
have open season on laurel for two weeks each year. 
The point remains, 
though, that things must be managed and must change in order to stay the 
same. 
And this is one area in which our training as folklorists can be 
usefully be put to the test. 
Bill Lucas thinks more people who understand 
the nature of farming should be involved in making decisions about how 
flora in the Pinelands should and can be best preserved. 
I think most of 
the other people I spoke with would agree with him. 'Preservation from' the 
point of view of those who work with the flora in the Pinelands might be 
an interesting tack for a case study to take in the next phase of the pro-
ject. 
The expertise is there. 
One of the topics necessary to an investigation of preservation issues 
in the Pinelands would be the importance, or not, and the definition of, 
what is indigenous. 
There are conflicts of interest on this point that 
people who work with the flora in question could elucidate and possibly 
cure, at least through some form of compromise. 
The issue of preservation directly ties up with what roles the state 
and federal government should play, again a complicated issue. 
The Carneys 
saw this as a problem that could be solved, not by deciding who owns what 
land, but by how that organization uses its power. 
They had creative ideas 
as did Steven Lee III, a member of the Pinelands Commission. 
The point here 
is not an elucidation of what those ideas are, but that they are available 
to us. 
What we could use here is not just a series of cognitive maps of 
individual points of view, but social maps ^of the way groups of people 
organize their beliefs about the shape of the Pinelands. 
Pressure points 
like the conflicts of interest surrounding issues like preservation could 
provide foci for defining interest groups clearly in order to begin to 
discover what might be said about policy by us. 
In summary, my fieldwork led me to many issues that seemed to dovetail 
with those that others found important. 
It also led me to the reali-
zation that the very existence of some beliefs threaten others, and there 
are interest groups as well who do not share a sense of identity with 
any of these conflicts, and yet will be affected by any decisions made. 
Any policy statement would have to result from an investigation of all 
of these interest groups. 
At this point it seems that we have not made 
much contact with some of these groups of people,e.g., those who do not 
have a direct connection to the land and/or do not have a sense of place 
but live in the Pinelands. 
Further we have yet to clarify our own position, 
our sense of place, in terms of whether or not we should be recommending 
policy, and what shape a policy statement might take. 
I 
bring this up not 
as -negative criticism but as an important issue for discussion perhaps at 
the January meeting. 
As a researcher on the first phase of this project I learned =a lot 
about the Pinelands and about public sector folklife project work. 
I 
enjoyed the work very much, and this was good news for me because I did not 
know if I 
would take to this kind of work. 
Of course I 
have lots of ideas 
about how things could work more efficiently, but I 
would like to mention 
them in ii..i,t n,; thF fair tti+=t thn 
Wnc r,Tn cpll nnnnnh tr, allna for 
5/ 
The first problem I 
had as a part-time worker was job definition. 
As the job definition changed as we got into the field, as it often 
does, I 
was unclear about what I 
was to focus on and into what depth 
I should go. 
Because time is so limited and a part-time job is even 
more limited, on a project like this, clear, while changing, job def-
inition is necessary. 
Mary and I 
worked on this, but I think it is 
useful to bring up so as not to be a surprise in the future as it was 
to us 
Another problem that relates to job definition is use of time in 
the field, and this applies to full-,as well as part-,time workers. 
While 
the amount of time working must be kept flexible, no guidelines create 
a situation where people work umpteen hours per day. 
There are many 
factors involved here, the job market, egos, etc. 
The issue, however, 
is an important one, and a discussable one. 
I do not think that we can 
necessarily expect to find quality work if enough quantity of work is 
done. 
On the first phase of the project was self-motivated and worked 
long hours, too long I think, 
I 
have held many service oriented jobs 
that have this same problem built in. 
It is not the mark of people who 
are professional at what they do to create unnecessary pressure for 
themselves, and I think this is what we often do. 
I enjoyed learning to use the Nagras, Nikons, and Kaypros. 
I think 
as Alan mentioned in a talk at the U. of Penn in the Fall, that academic 
folklorists need to use these tools more efficiently. 
I greatly appred- 
iated the help Carl and Joseph gave me. 
There is also something that aca-
demic folklorists can offer those more technologically minded and that 
is that tape recorders, cameras, and verbal interview techniques are all 
measuring instruments that frame an interview. 
On the one hand it is impor-
tant to know as much as possible about how to use these measuring instru-
ments. 
It is also important to decide when and where to use which ones. 
It is naive to think that just talking with someone is not as formal and 
framed as taking their picture (and as intrusive ). 
It is also naive to 
think that all techniques are useful in all situations. 
And it is impor-
tant to know how we shape discussions and photographs. 
This is an on-
going discussion, but needs to be discussed. 
I think we had some problems with the layout of our workplace. 
There 
was nowhere to relax, to get away from work and still be with others who 
were working on the project. 
Some people think this is because we did 
not have the optimal number of people working, that we had too many. 
I 
think it is more a matter of relation of machinery and space to the num-
ber of people using them, and it. 
We needed more printers and light 
tables, and work surfaces. 
I think there may have been a better way to 
work out security, if that was the reason, than to have people living in 
the house. 
Use of the rooms upstairs, for example, for relaxation, or 
one room as a workspace, might have been more efficient given the avail-
ability of rooms across the street. 
It was also a hazard to have the 
exposed vent pipe in the room where most of the computer work was done. 
Creating the archive in the field waa terrific idea. 
I think it 
So is important, though, to build in the time it takes to edit all of 
our initital writing, especially fieldnotes. 
The archive in the field 
should not be mistaken for the archive that is finally archived. 
I think the project administrator position is a key one to a pro-
ject like this and that Sue did a terrific job. 
She is a masterful 
6/ 
organizer. 
As a position it might be more sensible to ;sake it one 
that does not include as much fieldwork. 
if Sue had had more time, 
she might have been ableto•` scie•iule and facilitate meetings on a 
regular basis, so that we could keep in touch with each other while 
working. 
One problem that could have been resolved organizationally 
in a meeting, for example, was the effect part-time workers had when 
they more-or-less barged in to work already in progress each week. 
I 
do not think the solution would necessarily have the part-time workers 
work steadily for x weeks. 
But we could have been more sensitive to 
the different roles we had as part-timers, and organized use of the 
equipment more efficiently. 
Again I 
would like to say that this critique was made possible by 
the project's efficiency and openness to criticism and change. 
Finally, 
I liked the theme of the project, "One Space, Many Places." 
It gave us 
all a way in to the lives of the people of the Pinelands, and I 
have a 
feeling that a lot of the ease with which we entered the Pinelands we 
owe to Mary, and to Nora, who have worked there for quite a while succes-
fully. 
I think that one of the uses we can make of the theme at this 
point would be to see what groups of people do not have that sense of 
place or places in the Pinelands, as well as to define more clearly what 
those places look like. 
Here are a few ideas for arts exhibits and articles I 
would be inter-
ested in working on. 
An exhibit might follow cedar from the tree to a boat 
to that boat's use on the water for business and pleasure. 
Another exhibit 
might focus on the importance of ongoing technological improvements to the 
survival of the cranberry and blueberry businesses in N.J. 
Technology and 
cedar cutting would also be interesting, especially the building of 
corduroy roads. 
This might connect with issues surrounding the use of 
roads, e.g., dirt roads by bikers, or use of roads by hunters. 
The 
story of gun clubs might also be told in an exhibit. 
A sense of place 
exhibit could focus on ethnicity and religion and bring together groups like 
Russian Orthodox, Black Jews, Puerto Rican and Anglo Roman Catholics, and 
Protestant groups. 
You do not usually see them aligned and it would include 
a different kind of sense of place than we have focussed on so far. 
I 
would be interested in working on an article on the nature of preser-
vation in the Pinelands, what it is to preserve as well as how it might 
be accomplished. 
Another article I 
have thought about would focus on 
technology and family farming businesses in the Pinelands. 
This would 
include a discussion of the importance of a seasonal and generational 
kind of timing rather than a clock sense of time. 
An article on gun clubs 
in the Pinelands might be one way to approach insider-outsider relation-
ships , 
as well as community , 
hunting , 
and gender issues. 
Concerning people who would be worth pursuing further - it seems nec-
essary to work with people who embody pieces of the puzzle that is the 
Pinelands, and to bring contrasts into play through that work in order to 
see many pieces of the puzzle. 
The Frazee family is a good one to keep 
in touch with . They have a lot to say about a wide range of issues, e.g., 
family , 
work, timing of their lives, connection with place, use of the 
land in a variety of ways. 
The Lee family is also important for the above 
reasons as well as the fact that -they employ people with a different set 
of connections to the Pinelands than their own. 
I do hope there will be a second phase to this project. 
The Pinelands 
is.a very rich area in many traditions that are not often the focal points 
of a project like this, and that is one of things that makes this work so 
valuable.
