Here is a little history of the last  few days with me. If I
 
write this I shall afterward feel able to go into the consider-
ation of other matters.
 
On Saturday the 5th inst.,  my two brothers-in-law who live
 
with me left town by two diverging railways to spend Sunday with
 
their little families in the country.  I remained with my family
 
which thus reduced consisted of my wife,  three little girls, one
 
little boy and an infant  (all our own children),  myself, a nurse
 
maid and a cook to whom we were much attached.
 
On Monday morning before day my younger brother-in-law
 
knocked at my door and came in to lie down with the yellow fever.
 
He had felt himself struck with it while with his children in the
 
country,  had gone to bed to wait  for a train,  finally took a
 
freight train on which he spent 8 hours of the night and came to
 
my house to receive the preliminary treatment of his disease 15
 
hours after the attack of a fever that kills in seventy-two. We
 
did what we could and though despairing of his life fought for it
 
with our might.

On Friday morning at 10 o'clock my only son, a child of 4
 
1/2 years,  was  found to be exhibiting the influence of the fever,
 
and symptoms were distinct indicating that the brain was
 
involved.  At 1:30  P. M. my fourth child was  found to have the
 
fever.  my brother-in-law, on the other hand,  gave hope of
 
On Saturday my physician expressed plainly his doubt that
 
either my fourth or my third would recover,  and on Sunday the
 
three children were showing the most alarming symptoms of black
 
vomit,  two of them even vomiting signs of it.  On Sunday night my
 
little boy appeared to be dying in one room and my smallest girl
 
in the other.
 
On Monday morning our cook was attacked & I had no room
 
where I could put her.  She went to her sister's house and took to
 
bed. My little boy was fighting for his life but had the black
 
vomit and was losing ground hourly.  The second child was
 
struggling against the same thing,  the fourth was barely alive
 
and the house resounded with the wailing,  moaning & screaming of
 
the tortured children. At 6 1/2 o'clock P.M. my little son
 
breathed his last.  The little girl younger than he was shrieking
 
with frenzy and the elder was retching and gagging.
 
My eldest child had long since been sent off the premises
 
and the infant continued well.  The state of the mother can be
 
imagined.
 
On Tuesday my child was buried without any ceremonies under
 
my roof,  the body being carried out stealthily to the corner and
 
there consigned to the carriage which bore us to the cemetery.
 
That evening the infant's nurse appeared to have the fever,  but
 
time has proved that she had nothing but fright.
 
Today is Thursday.  The Lord has delivered us out of much
 
tribulation and my brother-in-law,  my two little girls and my
 
elder brother-in-law's last child are in a measure safe. My cook
 
will most likely die tonight of black vomit or raving mad.
 
Such,  my friend,  is my short story.  It may seem a little
 
strange that I can today sit down and write it;  but I desired to
 
make this record in order to arrange in order the terrible
 
memories of the past ten days and I have used you for the
 
purpose.
 
Toward the end of these experiences I found one morning your
 
letter in my pocket unopened.  I thank you for it.  I believe the
 
offer you make for my novel is a just one.  I cannot go into the
 
merits of it,  nor is it necessary.  I am satisfied you are giving
 
me all you think you can afford and that you are doing as well by
 
me as you would for anybody of equal rank as a writer.
 
Please to remember me kindly to Mrs.  Gilder & each of my
 
friends in "Scribner's" personally.
 
Yours truly,
 
Geo. W.  Cable
 
I expect tomorrow to resume my work on the novel.

Dear Mr,  c Mrs. Lomax:

Though Shirley an
' I spoke to you only

the bare statistics of this wonderfull happening I would like,
 now
 
that

more detailed account of what has ha -ppened to us 9

I
'm afraid that I was very incoherent and very breif on the phone
 
but. Irm sure you will understand that for the past three weeks or so I
've
 
be
 growing progressively more bewildered, excited, nervous and exhausted
 
and
' that at the moment I called you I was most completely in the grip of
 
this
' complex state of being.
 
About nine or ten oclock on Saturday night Bess began to have sli ght
 
cramps following two weeks of expectancy. As c
Bess began her cramps Shirley
 
began to

through th1 s

 and I began to go slowly to peic
 I! w a
fr 
For over twentyfour hours Bess continued through a slow , irr egu
lar  an d
 
relatively painless prelude of labor pains.  If I had been alone with her
 
she would have
 been in the hospital hours earli r suffering frou
 
boredom and lack of action but Shirley weighed and figured and f
t of
 
bess' belly and kept us comfortably lolling around the house pl
ing
 
gin ru iy and entertaining Alan, Elizabeth, and Ann Littleton before  -h ar
 
an open hearth fire untill about midnight between Sunday and Monday
 
when the pains, though still iregular began to bot
'h r Bess enough to'make
 
her grimaoe a little and stretch about in h
: r chair.

B ess  and shirley packed th  ]ast things in the suitcase I went
 
out and got a cab and we set off for the hospital through a very pleasant
 
fall of powdery snow.
 
As soon as we reached the hos pital Bess was spirited off to bed and
 
Shirley and I got her papers made out etc. Then we went up to the e
'alting
 
room to sweet it out.  veryhody in the hospital was most pleasant and
 
thty.t'ne

 gave us each acup of their midnight coffee. About three
 
came in and told us that the resident obstetrician had
 
just '
examined Bess and f lt that
 ttilng wpul -d happen for several hours
 
and that
 she thought we'd do better to go home snd
 
et some,s1ee,
 
and they would call us when Bess was going into- the deliv er y room

very diplomatically refused advice and after about a half an hour of pacin -

bus (
 we decided against
 a cab as the streets litterally
