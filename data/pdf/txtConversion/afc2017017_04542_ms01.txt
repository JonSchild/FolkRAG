Time of Interview: 4:15pm 
Location: Barrel Room, Naked Mountain Winery 
Transcription By: Whitney Brown 
[00:00:36] 
KS: So where are we now, Randy? Can you tell me? 
[00:00:40] 
RM: Barrel room, amongst aging wine. 
#Aging 
[00:00:46] 
KS: So this is literally—this isn’t just for show, this room. Just to describe it, there are literally 
barrels stacked three high. How many about in here? 
#Barrels 
[00:00:57] 
RM: A little over 100 
[00:01:01] 
KS: Is this the bulk of all the wine that you make? Is there more somewhere else? 
RM: This is the bulk of the barrel-aged wines. Half of the wine they produce is barrel-aged, half 
stainless steel. 
#BarrelAged #StainlessSteel 
[00:01:22] 
KS: Is there particular wine that you age in the barrel? Is it more the Chardonnays that you’re 
trying to get the big oaky flavor, or—? 
#Chardonnay #Oak 
[00:01:30] 
RM: Have made Chardonnay here for 40 years in the same style. Burgundian style, so light oak. 
Age between 1000-1200 cases. Most of reds go through the barrel room at some point, too. 
#BurgundianStyle #Burgundy #Chardonnay #reds 
[00:01:52] 
KS: Where do you get your barrels from?

RM: Brokers get them from France and Hungary, mostly. Have transitioned into some American 
oak for bigger reds, but most from France. 
#France #Hungary #oak #AmericanOak #reds #barrels 
[00:02:07] 
KS: Ah, okay. So they’re still producing a lot of the oak barrels for 
RM: Exactly 
KS: ... the whole world. 
 
[00:02:15] 
RM: Yes. It all has to do with style of oak that grows in France, the way the forests are. Some 
people can tell when they buy a wine what forest the oak was hewn from. It’s amazing. We do 
most of it in regular barrique barrels—the Bordeaux-style barrels. Also have some puncheons 
(“the big boys over there”). Those have to do with service-to-volume ratios. Newer oak, but give 
less oaky flavor because there is more volume to the surface area. 
#Forests #oak #Barrique #Bordeaux #puncheon 
[00:02:59] 
KS: And those are about one and half times as big 
RM: Two 
KS: as the other ones? Oh, they’re twice as big. 
RM: Yep, volumetrically they’re two times as big. 
KS: Okay. 
 
[00:03:08] 
RM: And then we’ve our big boy “Bertha” over there. (KS: laughs) And she really is more for 
show. 
KS: Okay 
RM: And we do age wine in her. She’s filled with wine most of the time. She’s empty right now, 
but more it’s a showpiece than anything. 
 
[00:03:20] 
KS: Yeah. You just have to have a statement barrel, I suppose. 
RM: Correct 
KS: Yeah, okay. It definitely is a big one. That’s about six feet tall? 
RM: Uh, it’s about eight feet tall. 
KS: Okay, that’s a big barrel. 
 
[00:03:35] 
RM: She’s 3[000 liters. 
KS: Wow, okay. 
RM: A regular barrel is 225 liters, roughly. 
KS: Yeah, okay.

[00:03:44] 
KS: So, your job title here—we’ve discussed—is owner. 
RM: Correct. 
KS: What do you do day-to-day here? 
#owner 
[00:03:53] 
RM: Fight fires. 
KS: Yeah (laughs) 
RM: It’s rare that I come in to a day where anything happens as planned. Does planning for the 
next year, week, weekend. Does all scheduling, payroll. Does large-scale planning for what the 
wine is going to look like, what the winery is going to look like. Under construction at present, 
so assisting foremen, answering questions, problem-solving. 
#Planning #ProblemSolving #Payroll #Scheduling 
[00:04:33] 
KS: So you go between big picture to little picture 
RM: Correct 
KS: ...all the time. 
RM: Yes. 
KS: So what kind of a team do you have here? You have folks who pour up at the front of the 
tasting room. 
RM: Correct. 
KS: I saw some landscapers outside cutting the grass. 
 
[00:04:55] 
RM: Have a few folks who report directly to him. Have a winemaker, Joe Burgess, educated out 
in Washington State. Three managers: one that runs the tasting room, one the wine club, one the 
vineyard. He helps them to manage their people and projects. 
 
#Manager #TastingRoomManager #WineClubManager #VineyardManager #JoeBurgess 
#Winemaker #WashingtonState 
 
[00:05:35] 
KS: So that was the Tasting Room, Wine Club and the third thing… 
RM: Vineyard. 
KS: Vineyard. 
RM: Yep. 
KS: So that would be actually managing when things are being sprayed, when things are being 
pruned, when things are being harvested, what needs to be planted new… 
 
[00:05:54] 
Winery Workers in Virginia

RM: Yep, exactly. So, he manages everything that happens outside the tasting room walls. 
Landscaping, tending the vines… On this property and their three other sites.

[00:06:13] 
KS: Okay, so where are the other locations? I mean, they’re not open to the public, but they’re… 
 
RM: One in Delaplane, one Leeds Manor Road in Moss Hollow, and then they work very closely 
with a group in the Shenandoah Valley. 
#Delaplane #MossHollow #LeedsManorRoad #ShenandoahValley 
[00:06:36] 
KS: Okay, so, describe to me the location of the original here where we’re sitting. So, we’re in 
Delaplane... 
RM: We’re Markham, technically. 
KS: Markham. 
RM: Yep, we’re in Markham, technically. 
KS: I feel like it says on some things that you’re in Delaplane and some things in Markham. 
 
[00:06:54] 
RM: (laughs) Our zip code is Markham. Delaplane starts about two miles up the road, 
technically. Delaplane and Markham butt at the top of Naked Mountain, so we’re at the western 
base of Naked Mountain. The top of Naked Mountain in the east is Delaplane. That would be 17 
running that way, and then 688, which is Leeds Manor, runs parallel to 17 until they meet up 
almost at Paris. 
#Markham #Delaplane #NakedMountain #17 #88 #LeedsManorRoad #Paris 
[00:07:23] 
KS: Right. Okay. And so why this spot? 
 
RM: Original owners Bob and Phoebe Harper went by the adage, “Where you can grow peaches, 
you can grow grapes.” Says it’s true. Early frosts is one of the things most harmful to grape 
production. Peaches in Troy Orchard just over the hill bloom two weeks: before the vines— 
always—so when it starts to pink out on the hill he knows they’re two weeks: away. Always a 
little bit behind the peaches, so if they get damaged there’s a good chance his grapes won’t. That 
orchard has been there a long time and been very successful, so it’s a true adage. This vineyard 
faces south. Riesling. Great because gets warmer earlier. 
#BobHarper #PhoebeHarper #Frost #EarlyFrost #Peaches #Orchards #Riesling 
[00:08:32] 
KS: And Rieslings are a sweeter wine, so they like 
RM: Can be, but not really. 
Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017

KS: Okay. 
 
RM: Riesling is one of the most versatile grapes. Can do a dry Riesling in style of Alsace, or you 
can do a sweet Riesling. 
 
[00:08:47] 
KS: What does yours tend to be? 
 
RM: Usually sweet. Virginia right now has a lot of sweet wine drinkers. They do a “very sweet” 
Riesling in a dessert style, in which they add back sugar, and they do a semi-sweet Riesling 
blended with stainless steel Chardonnay, which has only about 2% residual sugar, so just off-dry. 
#SweetWine #SemiSweet #OffDry #ResidualSugar #Blend 
[00:09:20] 
KS: Smoothes it off a little bit. 
RM: Mmmhmm. 
KS: Okay, so we were talking about day to day, you do putting out fires, so you’re a firefighter, 
but you have your three managers that directly report to you, so who else is on the Naked 
Mountain staff? 
 
[00:09:40] 
RM: Tasting room staff. Eight pour on weekends. Vineyard staff of three, which is small, but 
year-round instead of bringing on a larger, seasonal crew. 
#TastingRoom #Vineyard #Staff 
[00:10:08] 
KS: I saw someone mowing the grass. Is that someone who would work on the crew all the time, 
or they just come in for— 
 
RM: That’s just our neighbor (laughs). Has time after school and needs the cash, so it frees up 
our guys from having to mow our lawn. 
 
[00:10:29] 
KS: Yeah. Perfect. 
RM: Yeah 
KS: It’s hard to find kids that will cut grass anymore. 
RM: Correct. 
KS: I feel like. 
 
[00:10:39] 
RM: They bring in a lot of local “kids” (college age young people) who have time and need 
money in the busiest months at the winery, June to August, when they need extra help. 
 
[00:11:14]

KS: So what is it that they’re doing at that time of year with the vines? 
 
RM: Shoe-positioning to get the vines to grow vertically. Leaf pulling to remove them from 
around the grape clusters themselves. Weed eating. Fence repair. Trellis repair. Mowing the 
grass.

[00:11:49] 
KS: Do you have issues with the deer or anything like that? 
 
RM: (laughs) Yes. Big time. Used to use plastic deer fencing—some still do—but they have 
upgraded to a metal one that is eight-feet high. Narrower spacing at the bottom keeps out fox and 
raccoon, which can also be really damaging too—to vines, to the clusters themselves. Worst 
thing to get in a vineyard is a bear—they push vines and trellises down. 
#Deer #Raccoon #Fox #VineyardDamage 
[00:12:49] 
KS: My friends up at Hollin Farm's grown their pumpkins way up on top of the mountain, pretty 
much, and they’ve had bears to—they call it “bowling with pumpkins.” And they just get in the 
pumpkin patch and just throw pumpkins around, and they’ll come and there are just smashed, 
rotting pumpkins all over because they bears had a party the night before! 
 
RM: Exactly. 
KS: Is that something that’s increased over time, or is it becoming more of an issue? 
[00:13:15] 
RM: No. Had a bear in vineyard last year. Did a little damage, but more of an issue of hunger 
than boredom. They get in there and play. 
 
KS: So tell me a little bit how you came to be here at Naked Mountain and be the owner of 
Naked Mountain. 
 
[00:13:55] 
RM: Came to celebrate wife’s promotion to a job in Atlanta, to spend time with friends before 
moving away. First Virginia winery they visited. Says he loves wine—not a snob, but admits he 
wasn’t expecting much. Was impressed by the beauty of the area, the quality of the wine, and 
they lady behind the tasting room counter said, “Well, it could all be yours. It’s for sale.” 
February 2010. Wife was cautious. They visited other wineries that day, but he did go home and 
put together a business plan. Had to convince his wife. He and his wife have supportive parents, 
so they leveraged themselves to the hilt and went for it. Recently borrowed even more to put on 
an addition.

[00:16:01] 
KS: Like they say, “You’ve gotta spend money to make money” or something? 
 
RM: Building they are renovating is as old as him—1984—and is showing its age. Crowds have 
increased. Peaked at 2015, but still a lot coming through. Wine Club. Need more space. 
#Renovation #Crowds #WineClub 
[00:16:34] 
KS: So you visited in 2010. When did you take possession of it? 
 
[00:16:42] 
RM: August 2010... 
KS: That is a short window. 
RM: ...So six months. Yes. 
 
[00:16:50] 
KS: And before that you were doing logistics? 
RM: Logistics and plumbing wholesale, yep. 
KS: And your wife was? 
 
[00:16:58] 
RM: Account manager for a cookware company. Got a second promotion within same company 
a few months later and was able to stay local rather than move to Atlanta.

[00:17:19] 
KS: Oh, so that worked out. 
RM: Yep. 
KS: So does she work with the winery, or she kept her job? 
RM: She kept her outside employment. 
KS: Just in case you were going off the deep end! (laughs) 
RM: Yes 
KS: And you wanted to make sure somebody was still 
RM: Yeah, we could pay the bills. 
KS: Exactly.

[00:17:36] 
RM: For past seven years, have been reinvesting in the business. He doesn’t draw much salary. 
They think of it as building investment for the future. Have moved off site after living at winery

for four years. Exhausting to look at your job all the time, so have moved a couple of miles down 
the road to Linden.

[00:18:18] 
KS: What do you enjoy about your work doing this? 
 
[00:18:21] 
RM: “I am my own boss. I have a degree in engineering. I’m more of an operational-type person, 
so I’m not customer-oriented. I don’t like being out in front of people, so I really like being able 
to run the operational piece. That’s why I have managers who interface with the public. 
 
[00:18:50] 
KS: And so you would say probably the hardest part for you would be dealing with the public? 
RM: Yes. 
 
KS: Now, I know you guys have a particularly narrow and windy road getting down here. Do 
you have the bachelorette parties and the limousines and all that? 
 
[00:19:09] 
RM: Yes. We limit them. That was the original road cut on the property, and it scares a lot of 
people off. We get a lot of flak about it, but we didn’t put it in. 
 
KS: But engineering a new road is tens and tens and tens of thousands of dollars, if not hundreds 
of thousands, I’m thinking. 
 
RM: Yes, something close to $100,000 to put in a new road. Consider it character. People seem 
to manage. It’s just part of visiting Naked Mountain. 
 
[00:19:59] 
KS: Right. Right. Yeah… You take your life into your own hands. (Both laugh.) I was just 
thinking as I was coming around that turn, ‘Whoa!’ You know that one blind turn is 
RM: Yep 
KS: ...is pretty wild. 
RM: It’s pretty intense. 
KS: So that has a self-limiting factor in it of the types of groups you’re gonna get. You’re not 
going to get huge buses... 
RM: Correct 
KS: ...or stretch limousines necessarily 
RM: Yes. 
KS: ...because they’re gonna bottom out on that top hill. 
RM: Yep.

[00:20:29] 
RM: And as much as… I think that we’re in a flux phase with the industry. You have people who 
still really push to get the limos and the big buses. We did for a while. You get people who drink 
and don’t buy, so a lot of $10 at a time, which is fine, but our goal now is to really increase the 
value of our transactions. So fewer transactions, or the same number of transactions, but more 
valuable. And the buses just don’t do it, and they can detract from the people who come out and 
want to spend, so we’ve pulled back on that. 
 
[00:21:06] 
KS: So there definitely seems to be sort of a dividing line between the places that are more— 
from the get-go they’re more designed for lots of people… Kind of like a more lively party 
atmosphere… the bachelorette parties, the bridal showers, things like that… and buses and tour 
groups and just kind of the huge groups… And then the people who want to have like a quieter 
kind of… I don’t know… What would you say? (laughs) 
 
[00:21:42] 
RM: There’s two focuses. There’s focus on the wine—which everybody will say they’re focused 
on the wine. There are the truly wine-focused, small crowds, boutique expensive wines. There’s 
that crowd. And then there’s crowds with more affordable wines that are just trying to get people 
in the door. So they take the bachelorette parties, and they’re more of a party atmosphere. And 
it’s a clear line. You know where people fall, where they stand. We kind of straddle it a little bit. 
Um, I think both sides would call us the other. The people who are super boutique-y would say 
we’re one of the party places, and the party places would say, ‘No, they’re boutique-y.’ (KS: 
laughs) Because we are small… Like you said, our driveway limits who can come in here—what 
size vehicles. And we have really cut down on allowing groups. […] Our wine prices are going 
up to encourage people who are more focused on the party and less focused on the wine to stay 
away.

[00:24:17 KS: Okay, so you really do have your hands full. 
Yes. 
And a renovation. 
Yes. 
And she’s working. 
Yes. 
So it’s a busy life. 
Yeah, it is. And harvest. 
 
[00:24:28] 
KS: Yes. So harvest is right now? 
Right now. 
Okay. 
We’re going to start picking on Tuesday. 
Oh, okay. Is that something I could come out and maybe take pictures? 
Sure 
Okay. 
We won’t pick here on this property until the following week. 
Okay. Well, just one of them—anywhere just to get some of that process would be really cool. 
We’ll be picking and processing the next two weeKS:.

[00:25:20 KS: (laughs) So you really have a lot, a lot, a lot going on. 
Yeah. 
Yeah. Well, thank you so much for taking a few minutes. Maybe you just wanted the chance to 
sit down for a minute! I don’t know! So you’re parenting. You’re running the business. Are there 
other things you’re active in outside of this work?

[00:27:36 RM: “So that group is really focused on getting those who can to work, and so they 
work here sometimes. We have projects—labeling and all sorts of things—that they come in a 
couple of days and will help us out and get things fixed up for us. Worlds have collided.” 
 
#Labeling 
 
[00:27:54 KS: Was there any kind of special training that you had to go through? I’m assuming 
there was a bit of a learning curve going from Logistics to Winemaking… 
 
Says he had to learn it as he went. Had a General Manager who happy about the transition, and 
he felt she tried to thwart it a couple of times, but shortly after they bought the place she was out 
for 8 weeks: to have surgery, so he was left to reverse engineer it all himself. It was harvest 
time—August—so a particularly stressful moment. 
#TrialByFire #GeneralManager #Transition #Harvest #ReverseEngineering 
[00:28:56 KS: So was it Bob and Phoebe? 
Yes 
Did they stay on at all to help you transition? Wow. 
 
[00:29:02 RM: They assumed she would help him, but she was out immediately and then came 
back with a bad attitude, so then she left organization. So he had to learn on his own, and he 
made a lot of mistakes, but the community is very supportive. Figured out a lot himself, but also 
had some advice from local winery owners. 
 
[00:29:47 KS: Right. Are you a member of—do they have a trade association type of thing? a 
membership at the wine… 
 
#FauquierWineCouncil #ViceChaiRM:an #Board #Fauquier 
 
[00:30:10 KS: I know the—I have it in my bag—the Virginia Wine Map that they put out… Is 
that—? 
 
[00:30:16 RM: Says it is the Virginia Wine Board. It’s a great map, but will go online after this 
year. Says it’s a big organization and very politicized, which is not his thing, so he keeps his 
activity local. 
 
#VirginiaWineMarketingOffice #VirginiaWineBoard 
[00:30:48 KS: So have you since then taken any trainings? 
[00:30:53 RM: Virginia Wineries Association does “Regulation Roundups” every couple of 
months, where you learn about the industry, the regulations. There are tastings. “The industry 
itself has been very pro-active in getting people to better the industry. It’s gone from I think… 
Well, it used to be, ‘I wanted to make wine, so I made wine,’ and you got mixed results. And 
Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017

now people have winemakers with training, so you are getting some really high quality wines. 
There are still a lot of wineries out there where, ‘I wanted to make wine, so I made wine, and I’m 
selling it,’ but you can tell the quality difference. So those of us who are hiring wine makers with 
training and education are sending them to seminars to continue their education and training.”

#Winemakers 
 
[00:31:32 KS: So does your winemaker stay on site? Is he just your winemaker, or does he work 
for other wineries as well? 
 
[00:31:38 RM: “He’s just our winemaker, and I’m very passionate about that. Joe is our second 
winemaker since we’ve been here, and our first winemaker asked about consulting, and I told 
him I was not comfortable with it. Because I think stylistically, a winemaker makes a wine—he 
has a style and— 
There’s an imprint there. 
and I don’t want that diluted by going around.” 
#Winemaker #Style #Consulting #JoeBurgess 
[00:32:26 KS: So how did you find Joe? 
[00:32:27 RM: Through the previous winemaker. Still has good relationship with him. 
 
[00:32:38 KS: And so Joe has been here for how many years? 
A year and a half. 
So he’s quite new. 
 
[00:32:37 KS: What do you look for in a winemaker? 
 
[00:32:51 RM: Education. Their portfolio. Likes to taste some of their wines. Says it’s less of an 
issue now, but originally age was an issue for him. He bought the winery when he was 27, so it 
was not always good to have a 45 year old man working for him. An older man might feel he can 
take advantage of the owner and really run the operation, and that was not what he wanted. Hired 
someone his own age—Seth—and it was more of a partnership. RM: is Executive Winemaker 
because he helps direct style of wine, but won’t get in the way of what yeast the winemaker uses, 
for instance, but says what style of wine and what quantity he wants to make.

[00:33:59 KS: So his education… I haven’t talked to that many people yet. What kind of 
training? Is it like going to a winemaking program at Virginia Tech or somewhere like that? 
That  has an Ag kind of focus?

[00:34:14 RM: It is. His winemaker went to a community college in Walla Walla, Washington. 
Says they have to learn chemistry and technical aspects, but also learning to actually work with 
fruit and wine. Training palate. What smells right, what smells wrong. What that smell means 
and how to fix it. “Something stinKS:.” (KS: laughs) “Why is it stinking?"

#Barrel #Tank #Chemistry #Fruit #Correction 
 
[00:35:22 KS: Right. So that’s sort of a funny thing… A lot of jobs you’re not really going 
around sniffing things to see if it’s working or not. It’s kind of a different 
Smell and taste 
skill set to develop. 
 
#Smell #Taste #FeRM:entation 
 
[00:36:03 KS: So besides developing your sense of smell, what’s the unexpected part of your 
job? Is there something you were surprised to find yourself doing? 
 
[00:36:16 RM: A lot of it. Didn’t know what to expect. Liked running the numbers, has got used 
to working with money. Spends time in the tasting room, helps in the field, cleans the bathrooms, 
runs around finding lights at night because something went out and they’re hosting a wedding. 
Whatever has to get done. 
 
#Numbers #Money #TastingRoom #CleaningBathroom 
 
[00:36:55 KS: So what other kinds of things do you do here? I’ve taken the painting class that 
was here. You said you have weddings. What other kinds of events do you do? 
 
[00:37:04 RM: Try to limit it to small parties. Serves lasagna from a caterer ever Saturday,

[00:37:37 KS: I noticed. I’m on the Facebook page, and I get to that, and I go, “Oh, that does 
sound good.” 
 
[00:37:21 RM: Says it has been very successful for them. Tried it first season, and it has worked 
out well. Helps keep them busy when others aren’t. That is part of the impetus for their 
renovation—they need a lot of indoor seating space that time of year. 
#SpecialEvents 
 
[00:37:50 KS: Well, yeah, I think it gets real quiet out here in the winter, and I think any time 
there is an attraction—something to do where you can get together and have a good experience, 
you know, it’s kind of… Because there’s so much going on in the growing season, but not so 
much in the dormant season, I guess.

[00:38:10 RM: Says it’s tradition for them now, and he has customers who come every week for 
13 weeks:. They love it. 
 
#Tradition 
 
[00:38:19 KS: Wow. And so how much do you charge—you give them… Is it all-you-can-eat 
lasagna, or is it a big portion of lasagna? 
 
[00:38:23 RM: Big portion, about a pound. Changing how they do it this year, somewhere 
between $11-$16 for lasagna, garlic bread, and wine. It used to be that it was so affordable—so 
cheap—and now they are trying to move away from “the cheap piece.” Wants it to be a quality 
experience people are having. Nice linens, plates, nice stemware. A “high quality” experience. 
Different from how the previous owners did it. Trying to elevate it. Might add salad this year 
since they’ll have more space after the renovation. 
 
#HighQuality #Experience 
 
[00:39:32 RM: “That’s what we’re trying to do here. Everything we do is… Well. You come out 
to the winery—you can buy wine anywhere 
Right 
You come out to the winery for the experience. We get some people who balk at the price of our 
wine—I mean, very few because I think we’re actually very reasonable… But you’re buying a 
bottle of wine. You’re getting to look at my view. You’re getting to enjoy my tasting room. 
You’re getting somebody to talk to you about it… So yeah, it’s going to cost you a little bit 
more. You’re not flying by the seat of your pants, grabbing a bottle off the shelf at the grocery 
store 
Right 
So there is a price to be paid for that kind of experience. 
Sure 
And that’s what we sell: we sell the experience of coming out here and enjoying the wine.” 
 
#Experience #WineryExperience 
 
[00:40:20 KS: Definitely. I mean, it is a beautiful place. You can’t see this because you’re 
listening to a recording, but he sun is blindingly bright. It’s actually quite nice today. It’s about 
80 maybe and dry 
It’s not even. 
In August 
It’s like 75 and dry. It’s beautiful. 
It’s crazy weather for us here. Yeah, it’s gorgeous with the vines just outside the window. So, as 
you’re saying, you’re elevating the experience, you’re sort of shifting the tone a little bit of what 
this winery in particular represents 
Yes 
Where do you see yourself in like five, ten years? The future of this? 
Sitting on a deck somewhere not running a winery! (both laugh) No, uhh…

No, ideally, would you be sort of the owner who has someone else running it day-to-day, or 
would you develop it to sell later, or? 
[00:41:21 RM: Developing it to sell later. That’s always been in the back of our minds. But they 
might stick around if they start to produce where he thinks: they will produce in the next two to 
three years, they might stick around and just back off a bit. Will produce an additional 15[00 
cases a year over the next year, which would put them at 75[00 cases, and he expects to continue 
pushing towards more expensive wines and fewer wines, which would swap this to a more 
boutique experience. 
 
#Quality #Quantity #Growth #Boutique #BoutiqueExperience 
 
[00:42:14 KS: Yeah, well, like we’ve said before, you’re seeing that kind of split between the 
different kinds of Virginia wineries. I know just up the street… Arterra? 
Arterra. 
Is that the new one? They’re very into it being a premium, premium thing, right? 
#Arterra 
[00:42:27 RM: “It is super boutique up there. He does 12[00 cases, I think. Maybe 15[00. We do 
about 6[000. And their wines are more expensive.” 
 
[00:42:38 KS: 12[00. So, yeah, very few. Okay, got it. I added an extra zero in my mind. 12[00 is 
not much. 
 
[00:42:48 RM: “Not much at all. It’s very small. That’s what our Chardonnay production is, 
12[00 cases roughly. But that’s his goal. He wants to be maybe at 15[00 cases. I’d like to be at 
75[00 cases.” 
 
Randy has new wine club, monthly fee to be used however member wishes—on bottles, at 
tasting room, for t-shirts, for the lasagna dinners—instead of as a 1-case commitment for 12 
bottles per year. $40 plus tax, or $42.12 per month. This helps to level out cash flow instead of 
have big spikes with traditional club. Helps with predictions. 
 
How he has to think ahead for production - plan out for years to come, not just months like a 
traditional business. Aging, bottling.

[00:45:10 KS: Yeah, I was talking to a wine shop manager, and that’s one of the things that she 
was pointing out—that there’s so much more lag time in wine production… So people don’t go 
into this work unless they love it because, yeah, you’re not going to have that immediate 
gratification. It’s gonna be down the road. 
 
[00:45:37 RM: Explains differences in beer and breweries versus the wine industry. How much 
more predictable it is, how much quicker the turn around because the fermentation and bottling

process is so much faster, supply chain somewhat simpler and more consistent. They are an 
easier investment because of it. 
#Time #Barley #Hops #Beer #Brewery #CashFlow #Canning #Bottling #SupplyAndDemand 
[00:46:21 KS: So some of the challenges that that presents… You might have had a great… 
Maybe you had a really great year for a particular grape, but you didn’t have that much planted 
in it, so you can only bottle what you have. 
Correct 
And then you’re like, “Well, that would have been nice if we’d had more.” 
 
[00:46:39 RM: “Yes, that was a great vintage. It’s over.” 
Yeah. Yeah. 
“And that’s why you see wine prices fluctuate so much, especially out in Virginia wineries. 
What used to be a $18 or $20 bottle if we have a great year is gonna go up because it’s gonna sell 
faster, and you pay for quality. We pay for quality fruit. If some of our providers—we pay a 
premium, but we expect a quality product coming in the door.” 
 
#Price #Quality 
 
[00:47:14 KS: So just a few more questions. Three. I see you’re wearing your Naked Mountain t- 
shirt. Is there any sort of special clothing, gear, tools that you have on you when you’re doing 
your job every day? 
 
[00:47:30 RM: Cellphone. “Can’t go anywhere without it.” 
 
#CellPhone #MobilePhone #Tools 
[00:47:36 KS: And do you get reception? 
[00:47:37 RM: Great reception. Not across the hill though. You can do everything with your cell 
phone. 
 
[00:47:51 KS: How many acres do you have in this lot? 
Forty

[00:47:58 KS: And do you know anything about the history of this place before it was a winery?

[00:49:56 KS: What’s one thing that you think that people don’t understand about your work that 
you wish that they did?

[00:50:08 RM: “I think that on two different sides. One is that I wish people understood—and I 
think every business owner would say this—just how much work it is. And it doesn’t stop. When 
you go home—when the staff goes home—I might not be here, but I have my phone, so I’m 
working. And the other thing, I think… just in wine… I guess just the service industry in general 
is, we’re trying. We’re doing our best. And if you’re not having a good time, it’s not on purpose. 
We are not trying to make you upset. We are doing our best. We are doing our best to make the 
best product, to provide the best service… And we’re dependent on the weather, and Mother 
Nature’s not easy to deal with. So we try. We are doing our best.” (laughs) 
 
#Workload #BusinessOwner #Weather #ServiceIndustry #Quality 
 
[00:51:08 KS: Right. Well, and it’s agriculture. It is—even though it’s bottled pretty and served 
in a nice glass, it’s the product of agriculture. 
 
[00:51:17 RM: “Correct. We are faRM:ers. And… There are so many weird things that happen 
in this industry, but I think a lot of people feel like they’re owed something for coming out to 
visit you. And we’ve seen this—it’s been a big problem in the past couple of years—people 
stealing. 
Oh. 
Not because they want to steal something, but because they feel they’re owed it. They came out 
and bought three bottles of wine—they deserve a… whatever. That’s not how this works:. You 
wouldn’t do that at a store. You wouldn’t say, ‘I bought two shirts—I deserve the mannequin for 
free.’” 
 
[00:52:04 KS: So, like, what kinds of things are they trying to steal? 
 
[00:52:06 RM: “Oh, you name it. If it’s not nailed down it can walk. We’ve had decorations 
stolen. Lamps. We had a lamp stolen 
A lamp?! 
Yeah. I don’t know. Don’t ask me. (laughs) So we’re pretty particular about where we put our 
merchandise, where the small things go. People take their glasses—everywhere the glass is not 
free. I probably lose 80 glasses a weekend. People just walk off with them. So when things get 
expensive, it’s because I have to cover the cost of 
Right—that stuff 
that couple hundred dollars’ worth of glasses that just left my facility. 
 
[00:52:48 KS: Right, yeah. Now, some places do give you a glass with your tasting.

[00:53:37 KS: Do you get any pushback from old-time customers with the changes you’re 
making? 
 
[00:53:42 RM: At the beginning. Changed the logo, which people weren’t thrilled about.

#Logo 
 
[00:53:51 KS: What was it before? 
 
[00:53:52 RM: Always a hawk. Still on the barrels. A red-shouldered hawk, which roosts here on 
tthe mountain.  Once was a very literal hawk, now more stylized and symbolic.   
 
Others are pushing back against the renovation, but reiterates he is doing the best he can—that is 
what he tells customers when they complain he is getting too big, or the space is too small. 
 
#Hawk #Logo #Renovation #Expansion #Customers 
 
[00:54:43 KS: So with the customers, do you think that’s something that’s changed over time, or 
have you always had problems with people acting crazy? 
 
[00:54:51 RM: Always had problems. People get a bit bold when they’ve been drinking. Tasting 
numbers are up, but we are very vigilant about how much people drink. Still, you lose track of 
some people. They wander off all over the property. They over-serve themselves. It happens.

[00:55:30 KS: Do you ever find anyone the next morning? (laughs) 
 
[00:55:32 RM: No. They walk the property, the lawn. Make sure the cars are gone before they 
leave to go home. Says the previous owners didn’t live there full-time, so when he and his wife 
moved in they discovered people were “parking” there at night (KS: laughs), so he got a ten- 
million candela flashlight and a shotgun, which cleared it up in about two months. 
 
[00:56:02 KS: Oh, my goodness, so it had a reputation as being a place where nobody would 
bother you 
Yeah, I think so. 
So you had to start bothering them. (Both laugh) 
People quickly figured out we were going to bother them. 
Wow. 
 
[00:56:13 RM: “We haven’t had many run-ins with naked, but every once in a while—every two 
years—somebody gets a little too frisky with the Naked Mountain piece. 
Right. And you play with that with your marketing and stuff. 
We do. We walk the edge… Intentionally, but we’ve had to correct a few—a couple of people. 
Right. So they just start streaking through the vineyard? 
Yeah. (KS: laughs) Every once in a while. Honestly, typically it’s girls. 
Oh. Wow! Okay. Girls gone wild in Fauquier County. Streaking in the vineyards. 
That’s kind of good for your urban legend status, I think.

[00:57:16 KS: Is there anything you want to add about Virginia wine right now? 
 
[00:57:18 RM: Marks this year and next as a tipping point in industry and in craft brewing. 
Negative impacts on wine industry because they are competitors. Feels there is saturation in both 
markets and some places with inferior product/ experience and businesses will begin to fail. 
Thinks they will last. Better quality, and larger place for VA, too. 
#CraftBrewing #Beer 
[00:58:17 KS: Well, and you have a longer reputation. 
Correct 
I mean, when did Naked Mountain get established as a winery? 
1976 
Yeah, so that’s right in the beginning of it for Virginia wine, isn’t it? 
Correct. 
 
[00:58:28 RM: Naked Mountain the second or third ABC license in Virginia for farm wineries. 
Been around a long time. Expects a “culling of the herd.” 
 
#NakedMountain #ABCLicense #FaRM:Winery #Riesling #SmallBatch #Quality 
[00:59:14 KS: Yeah, that probably needs to happen for the quality factor. 
[00:59:19 RM: Correct. “You can’t keep making bathroom gin and expecting it to sell for $30 a 
bottle.” 
 
[00:59:26 KS: Although there’s a long tradition of that around here, too!
