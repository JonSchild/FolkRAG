Why We Come to California
WHY WE COME TO CALIFORNY
Flora Robertson Shafter, 1940
Here comes the dust-storm Watch the sky turn blue. You better git out quick Or it will
smother you.
Here comes the grasshopper, He comes a-jumpin' high. He jumps away across the state
An' never bats an eye.
Here comes the river it sure knows its stuff. It takes our home and cattle, An' leaves us
feelin' tough.
Californy, Californy, Here I come too. With a coffee pot and skillet, I'm a-comin' to you!
