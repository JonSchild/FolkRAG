LORI KEPKO, Historic window restoration
Katy Clune  0:04
Well, thanks for taking this break from your work day.
Lori Kepko 0:07
Oh, anytime, anytime.
Julia Gartrell 0:10
Holli said, too, she's like, do you have any other questions?
KC  0:15
Um, well, I'm Katy I don't know, I don't remember if I actually told you my name. Julia--- I'm 
going to introduce us for the tape and then we can go ahead and get started.
LK  0:26
Okay.
KC  0:27
So it is Friday, March 19, Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell here at Double Hung in Greensboro, 
North Carolina. And we're talking with Lori. If you could introduce your full name and start by 
just telling us what you do here at Double Hung.
LK  0:45
My name is Lori Kepko. I've been at Double Hung for about two and a half years. I'm currently 
the shop manager, but I started out pretty green and didn't have a lot of experience and kind of 
I've just worked my way through the company. I was specializing in glass cutting, but now I do a 
little bit of everything.
KC  1:04
And well, maybe let's start with where were you born and....
LK  1:10
Oh, where I was....
KC  1:10
....what your parents do?
LK  1:11
I was born in Clear Lake, Texas. My mom was a stay-at-home mom, and my dad worked for a
tool company. I have two brothers and a sister. We moved to North Carolina when I was five
afc2020009_005--Lori Kepko interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell
years old. Went to Sedalia Elementary School and McLeansville Middle School, Eastern
Guilford High School and Appalachian State University for college.
KC  1:38
What did you study at App State?
LK  1:40
Psychology.
KC  1:41
Okay.
LK  1:41
I was a psychology major.
KC  1:42
So how did you get from majoring in psychology to working at Double Hung?
LK  1:47
Well, I actually never really used my psychology degree, I worked in restaurants a lot, bartended,
managed restaurants. And then I became really passionate about refinishing furniture, kind of in
my off time, when I had a little bit of spare time, I just did it as a hobby. And I do have two kids.
And so I was trying to balance all of that. And I got really tired of working nights and weekends.
And I was looking for something more stable, more of like a nine to five or eight to five kind of
job. And one of my friends was actually working here and told me about it. And I came in and
started working here instead and got out of it, and used my knowledge that I had kind of learned
on my own as far as refurbishing furniture, and brought that with me here and kind of continued
that on.
KC  2:37
That's awesome. Um, what did you start doing when you first got here, and how has your job
changed over the years.
LK  2:45
When I first got here, they kind of started me off. One of the first things you learn how to do here
is just abate and scrape, basically scraping paint off of old windows, and shaving everything
down, getting everything nice and smooth. Started doing that and then learned how to actually
repair the windows, which was a very long process, because they're all different, and we use so
many different kinds of epoxies. And wood techniques, just anything you could think of; we use
so much different stuff. Took me a long time to learn all of that. And then I learned how to cut
afc2020009_005--Lori Kepko interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell
glass and did that for a long time. And that's probably one of my favorite things to do here still,
is to cut glass and put new glaze in the old windows and bring them back to life.
KC  3:30
Do you go on site visits, as well, or you're mostly...
LK  3:33
I used to. I'm more in the shop now. But I used to go out in the field and do some site work. I'm
afraid of heights, I'm not gonna lie to you. So getting up on ladders was was not good for me. So
I kind of realized I need to be in the shop instead.
KC  3:48
Are you still refinishing furniture?
LK  3:51
I don't have time to anymore.
KC  3:54
As soon as it became closer to your job, it's....
LK  3:56
Yeah, it was you know, like, I'm doing work on the weekends. Exactly. So now I don't do that
anymore.
KC  4:01
And, any similarities between managing a restaurant and managing a shop?
LK  4:07
Absolutely. I mean, it's making sure people are doing the right thing. Here it's more trying to
train people on things that a lot of people, you know, everybody's eating at a restaurant. So that's,
you know, it's very relatable to a lot of people but not a lot of people know about historic
windows. So it's trying to get people trained up and pass down the knowledge to them and help
them become passionate about restoring the old windows, like I am. There's a lot of similarities,
but there's a lot of differences,  too.
KC  4:40
Tell us a little bit about the makeup of the shop and how training works.
LK  4:46
afc2020009_005--Lori Kepko interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell
So what we like to do when people first start is we kind of give them, like, we take a day and we
give them maybe, like, 30 minutes at each station just so they get a glimpse of what we do day
by day. There's so many different processes, we kind of try to streamline them and to, you know,
there's, say seven or eight of them. So we try to let people see what we do, maybe 30 minutes at
a time and give them a little bit of experience, and then pass 'em on to somebody who might
have more training in, like, another aspect. So we'd like to do that and then then spend, like,
several days working on one thing to get them get the muscle---what do you call it---the muscle
memory, and all of that down for 'em and just repetitive actions. Because we do a lot of the same
thing on a constant basis.
KC  5:39
Is it, is it obvious when someone's has a knack for specific areas?
LK  5:45
Absolutely. You can usually tell when people first come in if they have a passion to restore
historic stuff, or if they're, if they don't, you know? We usually can find something for everybody
to do, though.
JG  6:02
How do you learn about each project that you're working on?
LK  6:06
We usually will have a meeting with the managers; we've got estimators, we've got project
managers, myself, as a shop manager, the site supervisors. We usually all try to meet or have
some kind of email exchange and tell everybody about what's going on. We do have kind of the
standard scope of work that we do. Every job is always different, though. So we try to get as
much information as possible from every person involved, that has spoken to the customer, who
has been on this site, who has worked on the windows in the shop, to try to give everybody the
most amount of information possible, so that we make sure that we're doing things correctly, the
right time:  correctly the first time and not having to go back and do rework on everything. Make
the customer happy.
JG  6:56
So how in that process, it sounds like you accumulate a lot, a lot of historic knowledge.
LK  7:02
Yes.
JG  7:04
afc2020009_005--Lori Kepko interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell
What have you been surprised about through learning about historic buildings that you're
working on?
LK  7:09
I think what amazes me the most is how.... good---I don't know good is the right word. But so
many of the windows that come in, you hear that there are 150 years old, and you expect them
when you pick them up to just fall apart. And they don't. And a lot of them are still strong, they
just weren't, they haven't been loved for the past 20 years in....The amount of craftsmanship that
had to go into those windows 150 years ago, when they didn't have the technology or the tools
that we have now. I think that's what surprises me the most because the people that were building
those windows back then, they really had a passion for it. And you could see the detail, and the
time and the energy that they put into making these things perfect. And it's, I think that's what
surprises me the most is how good a shape that some of these windows are in, after being so old,
JG  8:01
Kind of a different approach than what we take to a lot of building now. We're kind of just
slapping stuff up.
LK  8:07
Absolutely. I mean, I think nowadays, it's more about efficiency, and how quickly and how
cheaply can we, can we put up a new building, where back then it was they're using locally
sourced wood, because they didn't have transfer trucks, and you know, everything to bring
products from around the world. Everything was from that area. So it's used to the climate in that
area. So it's, it's more adapted to the weather that's going to impact the way the wood---how it
reacts over the years. You know, it's just, it amazes me.
JG  8:42
Yeah, definitely. I mean, it seems like you learn a lot about regional, not only styles and kind of
history, but, like, the available material and supply. So like what kind of trees are common in this
area to build stuff out of?
LK  8:59
Honestly, I'm not the right person to ask about the wood; I'm not the wood person. I'm sorry.
JG  9:05
That's fine.
LK  9:05
Yeah.
afc2020009_005--Lori Kepko interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell
JG  9:06
But you see, I mean, you see the range and it's all related to where the thing came from.
LK  9:11
Absolutely. Yeah. I usually we ask our, our wood experts that we have in the shop, go to them,
and they try to find out which woods gonna match the best with what projects that we're doing.
KC  9:22
That's what's cool about the shop is there's so many different specialty skill sets,
LK  9:26
yes, definitely
KC  9:28
Walk us through the project that you're in the midst of now, Cone Manor, to give us a sense of
the scale and the steps from, kind of, contract to delivery.
LK  9:42
Okay. so Cone Manor is probably one of the biggest jobs that we've ever undertaken. There's a,
there's a lot of components to it that we don't normally deal with. We usually do windows and
doors and shutters. But these ones have capitals and columns and pedestals and a lot of things
that we're not familiar with. But you want to know what happens from the time that..... So we,
you know, our estimators will go out and talk to somebody that they want, they want their place
to be restored. And they do all the finance stuff, 'cause I'm never involved in all of that. So we
will send out a crew, and they will, they'll pull the windows; we'll put new ropes on the pulleys
and new weights---not new weights, §we will use the existing weights, but we'll put new ropes
on the pulleys. And we'll put some kind of temporary protection on all of the openings, so they're
not getting rain or snow or anything in the house.
KC  10:38
The pulleys stay in place?
LK  10:40
Yes, so what we do is we put, we put new ropes in there on the, on the weights, and then we tie a
knot in 'em. And so that way, there's, when we go to reinstall them, you just have to pull the rope
back down, and it's right there waiting for you. But then they'll load them onto a truck, and
they'll bring 'em back to the shop. And then when they come into the shop, we do this, it's called
receiving. It's the first step that we do in the shop. And we document everything. What kind of
glass is in it? How many lights are in each window? What kind of hardware is on it? Is there
major stuff that's going on that we need to repair? Do we need to replace any parts? Or is it just
afc2020009_005--Lori Kepko interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell
kind of like a [sic] epoxy-only wood filler and send it on its way? We take all of the hardware
off, and we bag it, we take all the old rope off. And then that's step one. And then from there, it'll
go into our abatement process, which is, we will put the sash in a---we have a big steamer
box---we'll put them in there. And that will soften up the glaze putty to where we're able to get
the glaze putty out and remove the old glass. Because we try to salvage every single bit of the old
glass that we can because... this history, and
KC  11:53
This is silly, but does the steaming process smell, because it's, like, loosening up years of grime
on a window?
LK  12:03
It's...imagine like what your Granny's attic smells like, or basement. And that's what I think it
kind of smells like it's just, it just smells like old dirt, you know?
KC  12:13
Like the start of the window spa?
LK  12:15
Yeah, pretty much like it's getting a little steam bath, putting it in there and getting ready for the
next step. Yeah.
KC  12:23
Sorry. [laughter]
LK  12:26
I love it. It is. It does smell old, yeah. And we have to be very careful because a lot of it has lead
paint in it. So we try to take the proper precautions to protect ourselves and make sure we're not
breathing in all that nasty lead. Where was it there? So we'll get through abatement, we take the
glass out. And we try to, for each sash---we give it during the receiving process---we give each
window it's own ID. So we usually have an identifier for the job name. And then we have a
system that we use here for numbering each window. So if it's on the second floor, the first floor
and then we usually will go across the the whole house with a number system. So we actually
take a, either a stamp or a Dremel. We Dremel those into the side of each sash, so that even if
they get painted over that number is always going to be there. So we make sure that each
window goes back where it came, it came from. So then they go through the abatement process,
all the paint gets stripped off. We take all the glass out, and we try to keep the glass packaged to
go back into the exact same window that it just came out of. Because, you know, if you're
looking in your living room, and you're always looking at that one pane of glass, we want to put
that same pane of glass there, put it back in your living room. And then after that we'll go
afc2020009_005--Lori Kepko interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell
through and we'll sand down. Because once you, once you scrape all the paint [it] tends to be
kind of furry or kind of tears up the wood a little bit. So we'll sand that down flat. And then from
there, it goes to their repair station. And as far as repairs go, once they come in through there,
you want to make sure that the sash is square, you know, make sure everything structurally sound
on it, that it's not gonna fall apart. Once you take care of all that, then it's time to pretty it up and
make sure, you know, if §there's deep gouges, if there's holes, if anything's messed up on it, then
we'll fix it, and we have a lot of different epoxies that we use to fix things. We'll also use
Dutchman techniques, which are cutting out and replacing with little pieces of wood where need
be. And then a lot of the epoxies that we have, we have to let 'em dry overnight, so that we can
go back and sand everything flush. So that'd be the next process is to sand all those epoxies
down. Then give them a good QC [quality control], make sure everything looks good. And then
we send them onto our finishing room. From there, the sash will be primed, and then we'll put
the glass back in it. That's what my favorite thing to do is.  And if, if sometimes we're missing
glass: it gets broken, it happens it's glass, it breaks. So we either try to replace it with what was
originally if it was wavy or flat, or whatever kind of glass, we try to replace it in kind, or figure
out what the customer wants. Because sometimes some stuff costs more than the other. And it's
kind of up to the customer what they want us to do. But we get it reglassed. And then we'll glaze
it. And then we'll do another QC on it, just to make sure that everything's still looking good. And
then depending on what the customer wants, we either finish paint it, or we'll just install it, while
it's only broad, and then they'll have a painter come in and paint it to whatever, whatever color
they want. And then once it's done, we package it all up, and we put it on a truck, and we take it
back and the field crew will install and put it back in and clean up the hardware and put the
existing hardware back on there. And they're good to go.
JG  15:58
It's a great overview.
JG  16:00
So would you say a lot of your job is making sure things are  staying---- well, maybe I'll let you
answer I was... I'm kind of  making a onjecture what your job might be. But what in the process
as the shop manager? How, where do you...
LK  16:15
What do I do?  [laughter] I don't know!
JG  16:19
I mean, it sounds like organizing, keeping an eye on things keeping stuff on time....
LK  16:23
afc2020009_005--Lori Kepko interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell
Absolutely. I'm big. I always tell people I'm going to Marie Kondo them, like if, like, I'll walk
through the shop, and I'm just, "Does this bring you joy?  Cuz it doesn't bring me joy, we need to,
we need to clean this up." But I do, I'm real big on organization. And I'm trying to find the right,
the people that have the skills to do the job that's needed, to put them in the right places to where
they can train other people. So that those people can continue to learn. My ultimate goal is for
everybody to be cross-trained in this company. So it doesn't matter if somebody is not here today,
they're not feeling well. I've got 15 other people that know how to do their job and can do it well.
So that's kind of where I'm at with is trying to get everybody trained up and make my life easier,
in a way, and make make the company more money and for us to be more efficient.
JG  17:15
Sounds like you are putting your psychology degree a....
LK  17:18
Little bit. Yeah.
JG  17:19
The people management and the skills... How many people do you oversee in the shop?
LK  17:24
It varies day to day, but on average, about 20---15 to 20 people. I'm kind of like the liaison
between the people that work in the shop and the front office. So I meet with the people in the
shop and also meet with the people in the front office, and just, I'm big on information, sharing
information, and making sure that the people that work in the shop have the knowledge to make
sure we're doing the job right. And also to let the front office know, where we are, constantly,
like this is where this project's at; we're meeting these goals, or we're falling behind, and giving
them reasons for why we're either failing or succeeding, you know, and how can we make it
better?
KC  18:12
Do you have any sense of how many pieces you took away from Cone Manor, and how many
you put will put back?
LK  18:21
I know for for columns and capitals, I think I was told today there was 32---32 each. So each,
each column has four or five components. So there's a pedestal, a cap, the column, and then the
really intricate capital that sits on top. So if that's all one piece, there's 32 of those. And then we
also have balustrades that we've taken from there. And each individual baluster---I believe we've
got close to 1500 individual ones, which we are we are hand sanding on a leaf, every single one
of them, which has been what's been fun. It's been a fun little adventure learning that practice.
afc2020009_005--Lori Kepko interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell
And then those those balustrades also have caps on the top and the bottom. So we have those.
Yeah, so there's, that right, there's probably 2000 pieces. And then, as far as the windows go, I
wanna say probably about 150 windows? Plus, I believe they're shutters that we've not touched.
We haven't even dealt, delved into those or screens or something. There's.... Yeah, there's a lot,
there's a lot going on with Cone Manor.
KC  19:39
So with a job like that, that everyone is involved in, how do you all celebrate when it's done?
LK  19:45
We'll party. Hopefully we'll have a party. COVID's kind of put a end to that, you know, you're not
able to celebrate as much. But if we come in under budget, a lot of times we're able to give 'em
employee bonuses, which is which is lovely. Nice pat on the back, too. And sometimes we'll do
lunch on Friday afternoons, you know; David, the owner, will buy pizza for everybody and jus'
let everybody kind of relax for the rest of the day after lunch, because we work hard. It's manual
labor, and we work hard.
KC  20:18
It seems like it's a good team culture.
LK  20:20
It is it very much is. Yeah.
KC  20:22
How do you? What do you credit that to?
LK  20:26
I think it's David. David is, he considers everybody that works here to be his family. And he
cares about people, and he'll work with you, if you're having troubles and you can't come to
work. And he, he's a people person. And I think he's kind of instilled that in all of us, to just kind
of watch out for each other. And we're not a big corporation, we're a small business, and
everything that every... everybody matters here. Everybody is vital to the success of our business.
And he makes sure that we all know that, that he cares about us, and that we're all taken care of.
And if you ever need anything, he's always gonna be there for you. And that's, it's a good thing.
It's be a part of like a really, really big family. We have fun. We, you know, we also want to kill
each other sometimes, just like a family. But for the most part, it's a it's a good place to be. Yeah,
KC  21:19
You said putting the glass in as your favorite part. Why's that?
afc2020009_005--Lori Kepko interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell
LK  21:23
I don't know, I think it's, I think it's in my blood. It's really weird. Like, I just, I kind of took to
glass in, like it, like it was just meant for me. I'd never caught a piece of glass before I started
working here. And I just, soon as I started doing it, I just I love it. I love the sound that it makes I
like I like the way it feels in my hand. I like being able to look at it and kind of think about like,
Who else was looking through this glass at one point in time? And what was going on their
lives? And what did they see out of these windows? And I just feel like there's a lotta, a lot of
history in the glass itself.
KC  22:00
Do you think you want to stay in this kind of work for a while?
LK  22:03
Absolutely, absolutely. I love it. Yeah, I see myself, you know, retiring from this place
eventually. I'd love to stay here as long as I can.
KC  22:15
That says a lot right there.
LK  22:17
Yeah. I love it. I love what we do. And I love the culture here. And it's, yeah, I'm very happy
with my, with my career.
JG  22:28
Well, I'm very intrigued by your shop. It's beautiful, it looks really well run and well organized.
What is it like being a lady in charge of a shop? It's not that common.
LK  22:43
Um..... it's not, it's, it's not as bad as I think some people would think I, I didn't just get thrown
into this management position, I actually worked beside everybody that I managed at some point
or another. And they see that. They, I think they see and they know that I'm a hard worker, and
that they respect me. And I respect them, as well. And so it's kind of a give and take for me,
where I'm not just gonna come in and try to rule with the iron fist. Like you said, I have a
psychology. That's, that's just who I am. And I try to see each person for the person and not just
for the work that they can do. People may have things going on in their lives that they might tell
me that they wouldn't tell a lot of other people. And I try to always keep that in mind and take
into account what people are going through in their daily lives and in their family life. I try to
kind of be everybody's Mama. It's just part of who I am. But it's, I enjoy it. And it empowers. I
don't know, I have a daughter who's eight years old. And she knows that I'm the shop manager.
And I feel like I'm kind of empowering her to know that, you know, when you grow up, this is
afc2020009_005--Lori Kepko interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell
possible for you, too. And just because this is a male-driven industry doesn't mean that you're
just gonna have to sit in the corner and do the pretty things you can get your hands dirty, too, and
you can learn it all and the sky's the limit. And don't ever be afraid to jump in there even if you
are the only girl, cuz you're gonna rock at it.
JG  24:19
I agree.
JG  24:21
Do you feel like you had to prove yourself, because you're a woman in there, in the early stages?
Or do you think that the culture was...[inaudible]
LK  24:30
I don't know if, I think maybe I, I felt that way myself, because it's intimidating to walk in as a
woman in a male-driven industry. I never felt like any of the men were expecting me to prove
myself. I felt like I needed to prove myself, not just to the men but to the women, as well. Just
that, hey, like I can do this work. You know, I'm not just some blonde chick with with, you know,
like, I can do the work, too.  I'm not afraid to get my hands dirty and put some elbow grease in
his stuff.
KC  25:07
Do you think your dad's tool career had anything to do with it, like just being around, like
equipment? And...
LK  25:15
It's... I was always intrigued by my dad. And he, he didn't work in the tool business for very
long; that was just when I was born. But when he, I can remember being younger, and he had a
workshop, and he had, he's always cutting up wood and building stuff. And I was always
intrigued; I love the smell of saw wood. But I was always afraid to get in there and learn how to
do that kind of stuff with him until I got older. And then it's like, okay, I can do this, too. But... I
guess watching him do it. And my grandfather was like, a really good master woodsman, when
he was a wood crafter. And I actually inherited all of his tools when he passed away. And so I've
got all those in my workshop now. And yeah, it's just, it's really cool, just kind of keeping the
legacy alive through them. And I think my grandpa would be really proud of what we're doing
here. And my dad is, my dad's still around. And he's fascinated by it and loves that we're doing
what we're doing.
KC  26:18
That probably helps you. Like you were, you started by saying how you have so much respect
for the people who did this really fine work in the first place.
afc2020009_005--Lori Kepko interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell
LK  26:27
Absolutely. Yeah. Cuz I know how hard it is. I know how hard it is to build a window. And like,
how did you do this without power tools? That's how long did it take you to do this? It kind of
blows my mind.
JG  26:45
It's interesting, the early exposure, I think having something where you had the idea planted a
long time ago that you were interested in, in the shop life. And it came back many years later.
That's, that's pretty good.
LK  26:58
Yeah. Yeah, I love it. It's really, I think what's really neat to me is to be able to, to sit back after
you've done a job and to stand back and say, "Wow, I did that," you know, like, I had a hand in
making that look the way that it does now. And it's, it feels really good. To be able to create
something.
JG  27:19
Holli was telling us that she doesn't drive around the state anymore. Like now she drives around,
and it's like, okay, now and like, always kind of creepin' on windows.
LK  27:29
Oh, yeah. Definitely.
JG  27:32
Do you find that it's changed the way you see [inaudible] surroundings?
LK  27:35
Absolutely. I was in, I was in Charleston last summer with my family, we were on vacation with
my kids and my husband. And I, are so we were looking, we were downtown, and my husband is
kept pulling me away. Because I'm like, "Oh, my gosh, look at... these windows all need to be
replaced. And these glaze lines are off." And he's like, "Hey, come on, we're on vacation, we got
to walk away." And it's just, I can't not look anymore. It's just a thing. Like I see a old window
or, like, what, "We have to go look at this." Like, I want to drop off my card with these people
and say like, "Give us a call, please. Like we can we can make these windows beautiful again."
JG  28:11
Yeah, it feels like a fight against time...
LK  28:13
afc2020009_005--Lori Kepko interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell
Yeah,
JG  28:14
Dealing with people who are maybe trying to cut costs or don't appreciate what's going on. It's
almost like you should have little proselytizers out there.
LK  28:21
Absolutely. I love it now, because it's kind of become the the in thing to do. It's, I dunno, a little
a little niche thing that people like, are really starting to get into, preserving history. And I love
that, because first of all, we wouldn't have a job if there wasn't that. But I just think it's awesome
that people instead of wanting, wanting to spend the money to buy new things are putting the
money into restoring what they have and bringing it back to its glory. And it just, it's a wonderful
thing. And I really appreciate it.
KC  29:02
I just want to have something described on tape: it was that Jack showed us that one of your
employees built, like, a internal column. Like to be the support for repairing one of those? You
know what I'm talking about?
LK  29:19
Yes, yes, I do.
KC  29:20
So we'll probably take a picture of it. Could you just describe what is happening with that?
LK  29:24
Oh, gosh, I I don't know the right terms.
KC  29:28
Don't worry....
LK  29:28
But ....
KC  29:30
....We won't even know if it was okay.
LK  29:31
Okay, I'm just gonna pretend like I do then. So it's pretty much, I don't know, do you know what
a biscuit joint is? So where you have, so say if you're trying to join two bigger pieces of wood,
afc2020009_005--Lori Kepko interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell
what you would do is, you would cut basically a mortise cut on each piece of that wood, and then
you'd have a smaller--a biscuit is what they call it--a smaller piece of wood that would fit in that
slot that would hold those pieces together. Same kind of concept on these columns. It's not called
a biscuit though. And there's a bunch of fancy words that I'm not sure what they are. But it's the
same concept. You just kind of use pieces of wood to join other pieces of wood together. Yeah,
Will, Will that runs our woodshop is masterful at that kind of stuff. And he showed me what he
had done. And it kind of blew my mind and things I would never think about. It's like, wow,
that's, it makes a lot of sense.
KC  30:28
Yeah, it was cool. It looks like something 3D printed.
LK  30:30
Yeah.
KC  30:31
So, so precise.
JG  30:34
Yeah, It seems like the shop is branching out of that. You have all these columns, and
balustrades, and all the [inaudible]. It looks like it's full of things other than windows.
LK  30:43
Yes.
JG  30:44
So is there a vision that things are, that you're more open to....?
LK  30:49
Absolutely. We we don't like to say no to anything. Yes, we are always going to do windows. But
people want other things in their house restored as well. I mean we, we do a lot of doors. We do a
lot of shutters. I actually, a couple months ago, this guy, I don't know if you saw it. In our
finishing room, there was this menu board that somebody wanted a new piece of glass put in; I
got to do that. That was really exciting. Do you know what a vitrine is? A glass vitrine.
Somebody had brought one of those in that one of the pieces of glass had broken. So I got to take
the whole thing apart and put a new piece of glass in there. Just little projects like that. People
are always bringing us little projects that they just need a little bit of help with that. Yes, we'll
undertake that. Or even these big, giant jobs, like Cone Manor ,where we're doing columns and
capitals. And yes, it may be a learning challenge at first, but everybody's gonna learn together,
afc2020009_005--Lori Kepko interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell
and we're going to figure out a system. So further on down the road, we're going to be able to
keep on takin' work like that. And now we're gonna know what we're doing.
KC  31:59
I like your motto: repair, not replace or repair don't replace.
LK  32:04
Yeah.
KC  32:05
Do you find yourself, like, trying to live by that outside of work?
LK  32:10
Absolutely. Especially if I hear people or, you know, like, if I have friends of mine, or if I just
hear somebody, like, they're getting replacement windows? And I'm like, "No. No, no, no, we
don't do that around here anymore." But um, some of, you know, for the age of their house,
sometimes it's not a option for them to have their windows restored. If they're newer, you know,
and... But yeah, I do find myself constantly like, oh, you know, somebody'll "Corner this corner
is broken off, I'm gonna throw it away."  I'll say, "Oh, no, no, no, no, we'll fix it, we'll make it
better. And it'll be okay. It's gonna survive."
KC  32:46
Yeah, we were interested in this project, just thinking about.... It's good I'm talking while this
[beeping in background] happens, it doesn't matter, but just thinking about, you know, how many
objects we each own in our lives, and how there are this whole body of professionals who know
how to take care of those objects. And I think when we were a younger society, like, we knew
how to take care of a lot more of the things we own. But now a lot of times, you know, you look
at something and you have no idea how it's made. You no idea how to fix it. So it's been... I've
never thought about window repair or window restoration. So it's been a joy to come and see this
whole world. That's just...
LK  33:27
Yeah, I'm glad you guys got to come see it. Not a lot of people are doing it right now. And I
think is a really cool thing that we're doing here.
JG  33:36
Are there other businesses that specialize in window restoration in the country, or...
LK  33:43
afc2020009_005--Lori Kepko interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell
There are, just not, there's not many in this area. I think David, when he started this business, he
was kind of a pioneer, especially for the southeast and he's got buddies of his that are all over the
country. And there, there's actually the window preservation alliance that he's a member of,
which I'm sure he'll tell you all about. But it's a bunch of his people that he knows that are doing
the same thing that we're doing just in other parts of the country.
JG  34:13
So the southeast is so rich, though, like with Victorian homes... [crosstalk]
KC  34:17
...corner on the Charleston market.
JG  34:19
...and Wilmington and, you know, Durham and Gr[eensboro?]. I mean, even just a smaller town.
LK  34:24
Oh, yeah.
KC  34:27
[noise of a truck passing] I'm glad the sun came out.
LK  34:31
I know... [inaudible]
JG  34:36
Have you ever had a total disaster in the shop?
KC  34:40
That's a good question.
LK  34:40
Total disaster? [laughs]
JG  34:41
I don't know, like maybe an injury or like a project that you just that got screwed up so horribly?
LK  34:50
I've seen, well, I've not seen it, but I heard about... yeah....Did y'all see those crates of glass that
we have?
afc2020009_005--Lori Kepko interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell
KC  34:56
Uh-huh, in, like, the stuff ready to go?
LK  34:59
Well no, just like the, with the glass like the sheets of glass. A big giant crate of that has fallen
over before
KC  35:08
Thousands of dollars?
LK  35:09
Oh, thousands of dollars. I mean, I've seen little disasters but nothing, like, nothing that was
mind blowing or life changing.
KC  35:23
That's okay. Don't worry. It's....we've, we've lost it.
JG  35:30
Well, we have proposed the project before COVID. We're just, like....
KC  35:35
Tell us all your secrets. [laughter]
LK  35:40
I'm famous, I'm famous
KC  35:41
[inaudible] You didn't know? [background crosstalk] No worries. We're recording an interview
with Laurie about being a shop manager at Double Hung. [male voice: ok, all right. Don't tell 'em
the truth]
KC  36:01
That's good. Because we've talked with Holli, and now we're talking with you.
LK  36:04
Yeah.
KC  36:04
...and then we'll talk with David  [unknown female voice: Oh, cool cool]
afc2020009_005--Lori Kepko interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell
KC  36:06
Yeah.
LK  36:07
It's a girl thing. That's why David's doing it. [crosstalk]
LK  36:13
He does. [crosstalk, laughter]
KC  36:16
I mean, Lori, to be honest, we've talked to---- now you're the third woman. Holli's the second. So
we, when we approached Jack, we were like, "Can you give us any women?"
JG  36:29
He was like " Oh, yeah." And then he sent us all the photographs of everyone. He's like "Pick
your choice." So it was exciting to see a shop that actually had... [inaudible]
LK  36:38
Yeah.
KC  36:40
It's... and it's been so different. I feel like, so we've talked to a lot of folks who, typically, it's
either a big shop like this, where it's like a family, and people are cross-trained and learn from
the, maybe old timer specialists. Or it's a complete solo one-man operation.
LK  37:02
Yeah.
KC  37:02
And those folks, we've found, have tended to be, like, kind of bitter. And I don't... like,
everyone's just overworked or curse, that they became a cobbler. And that's all they knew how to
do.
LK  37:14
Oh, really?
KC  37:14
It's been striking to me to see the difference in, sort of the approach to it when you're in a shop
versus sole ownership. And I've, we've found that those folks too, if they're older, usually older
white men, they don't necessarily have a plan for the business to continue. And they also
afc2020009_005--Lori Kepko interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell
sometimes don't even have, like, successful training stories, because then their knowledge is
proprietory. If they trained too much, then the person can just leave and go open another shop. So
it's just been really interesting learning, like, the, you know, how different and similarities, you
know, whether it's glasses to windows to trumpets to...
LK  37:53
Oh, yeah,
KC  37:54
... furniture.
LK  37:56
So of most of the people that you've interviewed, or are they doing historic preservation? Is that?
No? just any kind of trade, pretty much?
KC  38:02
Pretty muchm yeah. We've been pretty broad with how we've defined it, but more interested in
people who, like, learned on the job versus, like, you know, going to...
LK  38:16
Like carpentry school or something like that? Yeah.
KC  38:19
Or, like, we didn't want to talk to, like, we'd rather talk to someone who does upholstery versus,
like, a museum. conservator.
LK  38:27
Yeah. Yeah.
KC  38:29
But pretty broadly defined. (I remember we have to, we have to chase down the Bull City sound
guy....) But yeah, it's interesting how is that then there's also the, like, you're, you're doing this
here. So it means there's not another shop like this for quite a ways.
LK  38:47
Yeah.
KC  38:47
So you kind of become loners, in a way. If you're doing that independently.
afc2020009_005--Lori Kepko interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell
LK  38:51
Yeah. But it's great here cuz we can train people, and I think the, like, ultimately, their goal is to
branch out, you know. I think, I don't know if they told you already, but we already have a guy
down in Bluffton, South Carolina. He's startin' work down there. And we've got plans for the end
of the year to have a couple more guys head down there and branch out, and keep it goin'. Keep
goin'..
JG  39:15
It also seems like, I mean, you're working on such scale, it wouldn't be cost effective to do, like,
one window at a time in a single person shop. Like, you have to be set up to do the mass.
LK  39:28
We do have, we've got a couple guys that, they go out, and it's just residential jobs. And it's for
smaller things like that, where they can actually do 'em in a day on site. So instead of them, like,
pulling the window and bringing it back to the shop, they can actually just do it at the person's
house and fix it up there, and then put it right back in, and do that, and we just charge differently
for it, you know, because it doesn't make sense for them to have to pay for all, all of this.
KC  39:57
That's interesting. So like, for example, I grew up in a house that was built in the early 1900s.
And like, you know, had the double sash with the weights, but half the windows were stuck. So
you can send someone out to just...
LK  40:09
Absolutely. We do that all the time. But we actually, we call that a mechanical restoration.
Because some people, like, maybe your windows, they still looked really, really good. But nine
times out of 10, what happens is painters will paint them shut, and then they become impossible
to move. Or maybe one of the ropes got stuck in the wall, or the weight fell off or something like
that. So we call that a mechanical restoration, where we can just go in and actually make your
windows functional again. We're not going to touch the cosmetics unless you want to want us to,
but we do that, just mechanical restoration, just to make your windows operable again.
JG  40:46
I wish my parents had known about that. Memories of like, yanking on these terrible windows!.
Oh, gosh, and then learning.... You know, I actually ultimately did learn about the weight system.
And that was like, recognized, but actually a lot of the work was broken....
LK  41:01
Yeah.
afc2020009_005--Lori Kepko interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell
JG  41:01
That's really interesting, that you've, you can scale up and down.
LK  41:04
Oh, yeah, for sure.
KC  41:08
Lori, we asked everyone this question: what's your favorite tool?
LK  41:15
My favorite tool? Prob'ly my glass cutter, my glass cutting tool. It's probably my favorite.
JG  41:23
That's very satisfying. Holli, I think, that was also great.
LK  41:26
Holli actually taught me how to cut glass. Years ago. Yeah.
JG  41:33
Cool. Is there any other info you'd like to share about a day in the life, or something you think
that...
KC  41:41
....Advice for someone wanting to get into this field? As a young person?
LK  41:47
I think if for a young person.... Don't be afraid of your lack of experience. And don't be afraid to
ask questions. I think a lot of people, when they start a job, they might be kind of shy and afraid
to ask the right questions. And if you ask questions, you're gonna learn ,you're gonna learn to do
things correctly, rather than just doin' things your own way and assumin' that's how it's done, and
then getting yelled at for it later on down the road. But just don't be afraid. Don't be afraid to ask
questions. And just, just do it. Jus' get in there and do what makes you happy. And if it makes
you happy to see things brought back to life, then by all means, just do it.
KC  42:32
I can tell you're very supportive manager.
LK  42:35
I try.
afc2020009_005--Lori Kepko interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell
KC  42:35
Well, thank you. Well, thanks for taking the break from your workday.... [tape is turned off]
