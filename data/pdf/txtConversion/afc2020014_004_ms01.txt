Finding Roots: Asian American Farmers in Contemporary America 
Lawrence Tse 
December 29, 2020 
Interview conducted by Katelyn Reuther 
Larry Tse is the farm manager at Dig Acres in Chester, New York. 
This was a 
remote interview conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic. Larry Tse joined the 
interview from Cornwall-On-Hudson, New York, and Katie Reuther joined from Chittenden, 
Vermont.

Introductions 
00:00:30 
When they first immigrated to America, both of Larry's parents worked in 
restaurants. His father managed Chinese-American restaurants in the golden age 
of that particular food. It was the age of tuxedos, nice dining rooms, and giant 
aquariums. His mother served in restaurants. They were always around that 
industry. Since Larry's dad was always working, they would spend a 
lot of time at 
his restaurant in between the different services. Larry has very distinct memories 
of sitting at the restaurant's bar eating maraschino cherries as a 
child. 
When you grow up around it, you take it for granted being surrounded with that 
culture. They were always in the restaurant and around people that were part of 
the diaspora. Larry's father is from Guangzhou, China, and his mother is 
from Hong Kong, so they were eating Cantonese food at home. This included 
steamed fish, steamed bok choy, choy sum with oyster sauce, and soup with every 
meal. Larry says this is the food he grew up eating, and they were always eating 
it. Whenever they went out to a 
restaurant, they were going to Chinatown. 
Larry grew up outside of Boston, so they were always going to Chinatown to go 
grocery shopping and to get dim sum on Sundays. For them, it was a 
treat to 
eat western food. Spaghetti and tomato sauce was a 
once- a-week meal, and Larry 
loved it growing up because it was something different. When he first taught 
himself to cook, he learned how to cook Italian and French food, because he was 
always surrounded by Chinese food. He didn't feel a 
need or a 
desire to learn how 
to cook Chinese food.

Larry is thirty years old now, and at some point after college, that entire paradigm 
flipped. Now, he basically only eats Chinese food. He has a 
fifty pound sack of 
rice in one of his cabinets. That is the food that brings him comfort, and it reminds 
him of growing up. Even when he goes home now and his dad asks him what he 
wants to eat, he says mapo tofu. He eats mapo tofu almost once a 
week and says it 
would probably be his last meal. 
Larry lives in "upstate" New York now, so it's always such a 
treat to go to a 
Chinatown. Last week, Larry was in New York City and drove half an hour out of 
his way to go to Flushing. He walked around a 
little bit and went to a 
grocery 
store to get those vegetables he grew up eating and really enjoys eating now but 
can't find anywhere else. He says it's always nice to be able to go to those places. 
00:06:14 
Larry did not get into agriculture as a 
way to express his heritage. He studied 
agriculture policy in school as an extension of the environmental studies major 
he was doing before falling into farming. In a 
holistic sense, because he was 
around restaurants and food so closely during his childhood, he always felt very 
comfortable cooking and in restaurants. His first job out of college was as a 
food 
buyer for a 
restaurant in New York. Larry went into agriculture to see all of the 
different parts of the food system. He studied it academically and had been on the 
supply chain end and cooked in restaurants, and he wanted to see what producing 
food was like. He jokes that now, nine years later, it's his only marketable skill. 
Larry always tells people he doesn't grow western cabbage, green cabbage, round 
cabbage, or cone cabbage. He doesn't grow it, because he doesn't like to eat it. He 
didn't grow up eating it and says that coleslaw as a 
dish is abhorrent to him. He 
grows almost an acre of napa cabbage, because he loves it. As a 
farmer, it's really 
hard to be good at what you do if you don't love the food that you're growing. 
You don't find the joy and the care in seeing a 
plant come to fruition if you're not 
invested in how it tastes and how to cook it. 
Larry works for the restaurant group Dig Inn, which serves a 
western fast casual 
grain bowl concept. Chinese cuisine and Chinese food is not necessarily 
compatible with their restaurant's menu, nor would they want it to be. They don't 
really want their restaurants to suddenly be selling steamed choy sum with oyster 
sauce. Larry is given a 
certain degree of independence, so in the past few years, 
he started growing some bok choy and choy sum for himself. Because he likes 
napa, they grow a 
lot of it. 
Their farm program has been able to absorb what was a 
side passion of Larry's 
into a 
larger part of its operations as they seek outlets other than their mostly 
closed restaurants. In particular, these are outlets where they can be sending food 
for their communities in need. They do grow a 
lot of Chinese vegetables, 
Lawrence Tse Interview Log, December 29, 2020 
2 
including choy sum, bok choy, and scallions, because they found other outlets and 
communities they've been able to sell or donate to. 
New York City is a 
beast. It is its own ecosystem, and it's a 
very intimidating 
place to try and do business. There is a 
certain amount of difficulty doing business 
in the City's Chinese communities because of the language barrier. Larry knows 
conversational Chinese, but he can't watch the news. His vocabulary isn't large 
enough to actually be able to conduct business in New York. Instead, they sell 
vegetables to a 
Chinese supermarket in the Hudson Valley (New York). 
The first time it happened, it was because they grew more choy sum than Larry 
could eat. Larry brought some to the supermarket, they really liked it, and they 
began selling it there on consignment. There are moments in your career and life 
that are a 
culmination of what you've done and who you are. Seeing his choy sum 
in those thin plastic bags with the same tag that every Chinese grocery store uses 
was one of those moments for Larry. It was really gratifying for him to see his 
vegetables being sold back to the community and that it was something the 
community really wanted. 
Larry didn't know if it would sell, but the supermarket called the next day to say 
it was gone and they wanted more. In a 
culture that is so food-centric, there's a 
high barrier to entry because the Chinese community is so focused around their 
Chinese supermarkets. To be able to actually enter into one is a 
really special 
thing. 
00:14:30 
About twenty to thirty percent of what they're growing on the farm is Chinese 
vegetables, and that's mostly because they grow so much napa cabbage. They 
have a 
few foundational economic building blocks of the farm, and that's one of 
them. They're very good at growing it, and it has proven to be one of those 
vegetables they can move fairly easily through their own supply chain. In 
conversations he's had with this particular grocery store, they told Larry they 
would buy fifty cases of napa cabbage a 
week if he had it. 
The company Larry works for is very fast-growing. They were a 
start-up when he 
began working for them, but they've continued to expand in the past few years 
and integrate into the supply chain. This past year has been a 
very freeing year, 
because they've had to think outside of the farm as being solely a 
supplier to their 
restaurants. In 2019, they had thirty-odd restaurants open, and the total buy-in 
from the farm to the restaurant supply chains was less than one percent. In 2020, 
they had six restaurants open, and for the first time, their farm overproduced for 
the amount their restaurants needed. It opened the doors for them to take a 
step 
back and think of the farm not just as a 
restaurant farm, but about how they can 
also move product to markets in a 
very thoughtful way. Because they are 
Lawrence Tse Interview Log, December 29, 2020 
3 
underwritten by a 
restaurant group, they still go through various rounds of 
funding. They want to be very intentional about the way they sell food. 
Through Larry's experiences going to conferences and seeing other farmers, he 
knows there are very few other Asian American Chinese farmers in the Northeast. 
When he first came on at Dig in 2017, he was at a 
conference and someone came 
up to him to ask if he was the farmer at Dig. Larry asked how she knew, and she 
said that she heard they hired an Asian farmer, and he was the only Asian farmer 
there. There aren't that many farmers of Asian descent in the area, so Dig doesn't 
want to compete with them directly. They also don't want to compete with any 
other family farms directly, because the pie doesn't grow very much every year. It 
changes and shifts and different things become more or less popular, but it doesn't 
grow that quickly. 
When they sell outside their own restaurants, their philosophy is to find the people 
that are reliant on large-scale agriculture suppliers and commodity producers, 
packagers, and wholesalers. Dig wants to get them off of that system. Larry 
knows a 
lot of people, especially other small farms, who can't compete with napa 
cabbage on a 
commodity market at fifteen cents a 
pound. Dig is in a 
position to 
do that. If Larry can get the person he knows who makes kimchi to use fresh 
cabbage instead of cabbage that's flown in, Larry will meet him at that price. The 
price doesn't matter for Dig's operation. They can get the kimchi maker hooked 
on that local product, and when he wants to find more product of a 
similar quality, 
he'll go to another local farm rather than fall back on a 
larger packer. They don't 
want to be undercutting people, but there are places here and there they can slide 
into to get the supermarket a 
nicer napa cabbage at a 
similar price point to their 
community. 
00:21:01 
Larry talks about forging relationships with new sales outlets. A 
lot of times, he 
will just walk into places with a 
bag of vegetables and ask if they have any 
interest in them. Because Dig is so flexible on price, it's an easy conversation for 
him to start. He always tries to bring a 
sample with him when he goes to these 
stores. 
A 
lot of the farm's clients are second-generation Asian Americans, so there's not 
necessarily a 
language barrier there, and it's easy to slip into their supply chain. 
With the people he needs to communicate with in Chinese (he only speaks 
Cantonese), there is a 
certain amount of Google Translate Larry uses on his 
phone. He very rarely calls the grocery store they sell to, because it's much easier 
for them to communicate over text. They can text Larry in Chinese, and he can 
throw it into a 
translator, translate his response, and send it back. There's very 
little miscommunication.

The food scene in New York City, especially restaurants, is a 
big place, but it's 
very easy to find a 
second or third connection to whoever you're trying to reach. 
They're lucky to be working in a 
restaurant group that has a 
lot of chefs and 
connections who they can lean on to see what the state of the market is. At the 
end of the day, it's a 
lot of interpersonal relations and trying to find the people you 
need to talk to. 
00:23:47 
Larry went to George Washington University in Washington, D.C. for political 
science. He realized very quickly that it wasn't something he wanted to do. 
Mostly, he didn't like the people in his major. Although the environment was 
always something his family cared about, reading Peter Singer's book One World 
convinced Larry to shift to environmental studies. He focused on agricultural 
policy, because it was food-related and he was still very interested in food. It was 
the natural evolution of the work he did at restaurants waiting tables and working 
on lines in high school. Larry didn't necessarily want to work in a 
restaurant, and 
his parents definitely did not want that. It was a 
way for him to continue 
interacting with food in an academic setting. 
Larry's junior year in college, he went abroad to Australia on a 
very loose study 
abroad program. They traveled around the country looking at different 
environmental issues, and he ended up WWOOFing (World Wide Opportunities 
on Organic Farms) on a 
couple of farms while he was there. Through those 
experiences, he decided he liked the agriculture part more than the policy part. He 
carried that back with him to D.C. and volunteered on farms in the northern 
Virginia area. His senior year, Larry ran a 
farmers market in D.C. and oversaw the 
EBT/SNAP (Electronic Benefits Transfer/Supplemental Nutrition Assistance 
Program) benefits program there. 
At that time, Larry was interested in the concepts of farm-to-table, food justice, 
and food accessibility. That was the era of Michael Pollan, and the fire was really 
lit under the farm-to-table movement. Farmers markets were growing 
exponentially, everyone was interested, and there were New American restaurants 
opening on every corner. Larry recalls the academic approach to food justice and 
helping underserved communities get access to fresh food was having farmers 
markets everywhere. 
Looking back, he says that's a 
very white-centric approach to serving these 
communities. You can open up ten farmers markets in ten blocks of a 
minority 
community, and that community still won't have access to fresh food. Every 
single one of those farmers markets will be ninety to one hundred percent white 
people selling white vegetables. Larry wouldn't walk into a 
Chinese grocery store 
with twenty cases of green kale or a 
thousand dollars worth of Genovese basil and 
Lawrence Tse Interview Log, December 29, 2020 
5 
expect to sell it. Why should our farmers markets do the same thing to these 
communities? 
That's a 
realization Larry had while working on a 
CSA (Community Supported 
Agriculture) farm in Pennsylvania. He tried to grow Chinese vegetables, and they 
were roundly rejected by the CSA members. There were a 
lot of complaints, and it 
was clear people did not want that. It's the opposite side of the coin, where you're 
going into these communities without understanding the cultural foodways, trying 
to hawk a 
different culture's food, and wondering why it's not working. Most of 
the farmers markets from those early years are all gone now. Those communities 
still aren't being served. 
There's a 
problem in agriculture where most farmers are white and from upper-
middle class backgrounds. When Larry first started working on a 
farm in 2012, he 
was paid six hundred dollars a 
month. For a 
lot of people, that's not an acceptable 
risk, especially those that don't come from a 
privileged background or have 
generational money to fall back on if things don't work out. It's a 
big risk where 
you're deferring loans and building interest. Larry had four or five credit cards 
that he would lean on to make it through. He says he gets why this is the way it is. 
There is no money around. It isn't that farmers don't want to pay their workers 
anything, it's that they just can't. 
At the end of the day, the outcome is the same. You only have a 
certain class of 
people who become farmers and then turn around and sell back to their own 
communities. If you ask young farmers who are invested in growing their 
businesses and making them economically viable, they'll say Union Square in 
New York City is the best place to sell their vegetables. You can sell spinach for 
twenty-eight dollars a 
pound or weeds you harvested from your fields for sixteen 
dollars a 
pound. People will eat it up. Economic sustainability is an important part 
of any operation, but the market is tilted for a 
lot of young farmers to hit that 
demographic. 
Everyone deserves a 
righteous wage and to live comfortable lives. One of the 
most dangerous ways of thinking about farming is that you do it because you love 
it, and because you love it, you'll live in poverty. It should never be that way. In a 
country like America, you should never have to sacrifice comfort and the 
opportunity to live a 
good life just because of your work. However, it is a 
sacrifice 
that a 
lot of people make. For people whose parents are in the diaspora, they came 
to America so they wouldn't have to live that way. No one wants to see their kids 
come to escape poverty and then willingly go into poverty. 
It is off-putting when you see the state of struggle that a 
lot of farmers have to 
enter the industry. The dream is the opportunity to choose what you want to do. 
Lawrence Tse Interview Log, December 29, 2020 
6 
Larry could choose to farm. He wasn't forced to, and that is the dream. However, 
to choose this and build a 
life that's worse for yourself than what your parents 
have is not appetizing. A 
lot of people see that that's a 
choice they have to make, 
and they don't want that. It's a 
broken food system, and it's broken for a 
lot of 
people. It's broken for Asian Americans, for Black people, for poor people, for the 
laborers, for everyone who touches it. That's why it's full of white people, and 
that's what we have to change. 
00:36:10 
Larry's father has always said that it doesn't matter what he does, as long as he's 
the best at it. It's Larry's choice to farm, but he better be good at it. Larry is very 
lucky to have a "corporate job," where he draws a 
salary and is able to live 
comfortably and still farm. It's unfortunately much different than a 
lot of his 
peers. His parents feel good about the fact that he is able to have a 
comfortable 
life. However, they do always ask him if he's working. He says he's been working 
for eight years and wonders why they always ask that. A 
lot of Larry's cousins and 
the second generation say their parents came to America to not farm, but Larry 
always reminds them that they came here so they wouldn't have to farm. It wasn't 
to not farm. It was because they could have a 
choice in what they could do. 
With the older generation, food is still exciting and important to them. They all 
have gardens and love when Larry comes over and can talk about growing things, 
what grows well, and the things he is growing. They tend to be pretty excited 
about that. There wasn't necessarily a 
lot of pushback, just the hope that he could 
make enough money while he is doing this. 
00:38:57 
Larry doesn't have a 
huge desire to start his own farm. His appetite for that risk is 
very low. He has seen many of his friends' farms go under. It's not through any 
fault of their own, but due to the market and how things go sometimes. 
When Dig was flush with cash pre-pandemic, it would be very easy for the 
company to sink a 
million dollars into a 
farm to build beautiful greenhouses, buy 
the newest machinery, sell a 
lot of food at farmers markets and to restaurants, and 
use the farm as an income-generating machine. It would be very easy and very 
smart for them to do that. In a 
capitalist society like this, sinking a 
bunch of 
money into something that doesn't make money doesn't make sense. However, 
that's essentially what they've done. 
Larry told them that at the end of the day, this is a 
restaurant company and they 
make their money off bowls. The farm does not need to exist for the company to 
be successful. Larry trained on non-profit farms, and he loved working on them. 
He loved the education aspect of farming and learning. There's still production 
pressure, but there's an atmosphere where it's not just about making money. That 
was formative for Larry as he was beginning his career. 
Lawrence Tse Interview Log, December 29, 2020 
7 
He noticed that these farms never had enough money. They always have too many 
different ideas and not enough time or money to accomplish them. With Dig Inn, 
he saw an opportunity to start a 
non-profit-like farm without having to worry 
about money coming in and out. They're not reliant on donations, and the stream 
is consistent. If they can leverage the farm in the right way as a 
marketing tool, it 
doesn't necessarily matter what happens on the farm. 
They do on-farm education where Larry has structured an apprenticeship program 
similar to the one he went through. They do new farmer training and hire people 
who don't really have experience in agriculture. He says it would be somewhat 
difficult for people like that to get a 
job at an established farm. Larry puts his crew 
on tractors their second week on the farm. Larry has driven tractors for eight 
years, and he doesn't need to drive a 
tractor more than he does now. His crew 
needs that experience, and at the end of the day, they're all getting paid. If 
someone screws up planting their tomato crop, no one is losing a 
mortgage, losing 
their home, or going on food stamps because of that mistake. There is a 
lot less 
pressure in that sense. It's a 
good learning environment. 
Larry saw incubator programs in Pennsylvania, but he says they're difficult to run 
because you're just sinking money. There's absolutely no return on the money 
you're putting into it. For Dig, it doesn't necessarily matter. It's a 
good marketing 
tool, and they're doing good things. For their incubator program, they choose one 
member of their team each year who wants to start their own farm, and they give 
them an acre or two of land and access to their equipment, supplies, and 
sometimes their crew. The incubator farmers also have preferential access to Dig's 
supply chain. It's a 
three-year program, and the intention is for it to kickstart their 
operation and allow them to begin farming without having to sink that much of 
their own money into it. 
Dig pays better than average for most farms, but there's still an enormous amount 
of money you need to make in order to start your own farm. A 
lot of people don't 
start farming until ten years into their farming careers. It's a 
long time, and those 
are your prime working years. You can go and work thirteen or fourteen hours a 
day, and it doesn't matter. Your body can handle it. Once you get older, you just 
can't do that anymore. 
Dig wants to make sure these farmers are able to build their businesses when 
they're young and able to handle that kind of risk, but also not risk their own 
money. Larry found himself in a 
very fortunate and privileged situation where 
they can take a 
lot of money and put it to good use. That's what Larry is there for, 
and that's why he doesn't see himself leaving the organization. If he did, it would 
feel sort of like abandoning the incubator farmers he brought in. Larry trusts 
Lawrence Tse Interview Log, December 29, 2020 
8 
himself to take the farm in a 
righteous and ethical direction, and he wants to make 
sure that it remains that way. 
00:46:41 
Larry has been at Dig's farm since it started. The 2020 season was their fourth 
year of operation. 
00:47:05 
Larry has always told their leadership that his personal red line is the farmers 
market. He will never do a 
farmers market for this farm. If they force him to, he 
would leave. While he doesn't think it's right for a 
farm like that to openly 
compete with other farms, at the end of the day, if they do, it's Larry doing it, and 
he doesn't want to be associated with that. It's a 
small community and word gets 
around fast. 
For a 
very long time, they resisted trying to sell outside of Dig. The pandemic 
changed all of that. Ultimately, Larry's feeling was they have to survive. At the 
end of the day, if the farm doesn't exist, it can't do good. They have to figure out 
a 
way to make sure that the farm looks good to the company so that it's not just 
liquidated in a 
panic. 
They sell to FreshDirect, which is an online grocery store based out of New York. 
In Larry's view, the Venn diagram of people who go to the farmers market and 
those who buy their groceries on FreshDirect.com is probably very small. He 
doesn't necessarily have a 
huge problem selling there, especially when they're 
competing with a 
local farm that's one hundred and fifty acres. Their farm is 
twenty acres. 
They essentially have a 
small-holder farm that sells on a 
commodity market. 
None of their prices make sense, which is why they always lose money on paper. 
Even though they produce just as much as any other farm, they're not really 
making money because they sell cabbage at fifteen cents a 
pound. They're 
competing with other commodity farms, and they couldn't make a 
dent in those 
farms' books. The amount that Dig's farm is selling compared to these other farms 
is miniscule. There's a 
Korean restaurant in Brooklyn that they sell ponytail 
radishes to for kimchi. No one else successfully grows ponytail out there, 
so where they can step in and fill needs is where they take their external sales. 
Larry knows he can't move any radicchio off his farm, because his friend sells it 
at Union Square to all of the nice restaurants. Even if Larry wanted to approach 
these restaurants to sell radicchio, they wouldn't buy it from him. Being very 
cautious with that is paramount to the farm. 
Larry does education for their crews, but they also do education for their 
restaurant staff. All of their staff is invited to the farm, and for a 
lot of them, it's 
Lawrence Tse Interview Log, December 29, 2020 
9 
their first time to a 
farm. For some people, it's their first time out of the City. They 
love doing these farm tours and other outward-facing education events. They want 
to do more, because they're in that unique position where it's a 
non-profit farm 
operating in a 
for-profit world. They have the time to give tours, and they don't 
need to charge admission or take anything. The core of their farm is education, 
and they want that to be accessible to everyone. They don't want someone to have 
to pay ten dollars to step onto a 
farm. 
Prior to the pandemic, they were going to buy a 
second farm in Dutchess County 
(New York), and that was going to be an entirely externally-facing farm. The farm 
in Chester was going to remain their large-scale production farm. The pandemic 
scuttled those plans, but it's still something they really want to do. They want to 
build this farm to be an education center where they are an open book to their 
entire community. 
The future of their sales is something they're debating right now. How important 
is the farm to the core menu of Dig? Does the entire farm move to an equity focus 
where a 
lot of the food ends up getting donated to different organizations or they 
create boxes for donation? The economic impact of the pandemic is certainly 
going to be felt for a 
very long time. How can they leverage the farm to help with 
that? What's the split? Does fifty percent of the farm go to that kind of work and 
fifty percent goes back to their menus? Is it twenty-five percent outside sales, 
twenty-five percent inside, and the rest goes to equity? It's something they're 
actively trying to figure out right now. 
Having worked on a 
lot of different farms that are mainly consumer-facing, Larry 
says there is so much waste on the farm side. Product that is marred, too big, too 
small, imperfect all gets thrown out. Dig donates a 
lot of food that they 
overproduce or that isn't the right size. They have a 
network of food banks they 
work with, and these programs are important to the farm in an equity sense, but 
also because they're taking good food that shouldn't be thrown out. 
00:55:12 
Larry talks about his Chinese American identity within the work he is doing. He 
reiterates that the core menu of Dig isn't really compatible with Chinese 
vegetables, and it doesn't need to be. What is really striking to Larry, and was 
challenging to him as he started farming, is that he is not what a 
lot of people 
think of when they think farmer. He's 5'5", short, Chinese. It was a 
challenging 
notion to many of their chefs when he first started. They would come up to him 
and say they expected Larry to be an old white person. When you're not so 
established in your career, that's a 
difficult thing to hear. You want to be taken 
seriously, but you're always hearing that people didn't expect you to be this way, 
or that they didn't expect a 
Chinese farmer. 
Lawrence Tse Interview Log, December 29, 2020

At certain times in his career, Larry has been passed over for promotions because 
he didn't necessarily fit the part. At one of the farms he worked on, another 
apprentice on his team was asked to become a 
manager, even though he didn't 
work for most of that year due to an injury. However, because he fit the image of 
what you think a 
farmer looks like, he was asked to be a 
manager and Larry was 
not. 
Larry says where he is now is a 
good fit. His reputation often precedes him, so 
people don't say it anymore, but they're still surprised. That act of surprising 
people is a 
good thing. They realize farmers don't have to be old and white, but 
can instead be young and Chinese. He likes doing PR runs for the company, 
because he knows he can be another face in this world and be surprising people. 
He shows others that the person they've heard so much about is Chinese and isn't 
the stereotypical farmer they would imagine. 
00:59:25 
Larry describes the communities that have been part of his journey as a 
Chinese 
American farmer. There are not a 
lot of other Chinese or Asian farmers. When 
you find them, you try to hold onto them. However, Larry thinks that all young 
farmers have problems finding community in those areas, not just him as a 
person 
of Chinese descent. 
When Larry first started in Chester, all of the other farmers were old and white. 
They're also all conventional farmers. He says it's a 
shock to have this young 
person who looks different than them and is farming in a 
way that is almost 
antithetical to the way they have farmed the land for forty years. Larry says he is 
lucky to be fairly good at his job, so he doesn't encounter the racism from them 
that he's sure he would if he wasn't quite as good. 
Finding community in general is hard. They're lucky to have a 
fairly active 
National Young Farmers Coalition chapter in the Hudson Valley. That's a 
great 
source of community for a 
lot of people. When there may not be many young 
farmers near you, you know there is a 
network you can lean on throughout the 
Valley. 
They're also fortunate to be where they are in Chester. Dig leases land from an 
agricultural center that also leases land to five other farms. They have a 
small 
community there that shares knowledge and tools, and they're all farming in 
basically the same way. That's another source of support. To find Asian 
community out there is really difficult. Larry is kind of friends with the guy who 
does dry cleaning in Chester, solely because he's Korean. Larry doesn't get 
anything dry cleaned but goes by now and then to drop off vegetables.

It's also difficult for Larry, because his family is not from New York. Without any 
family or relatives who live in New York, he doesn't have close ties to the 
Chinese communities in the City. Not having those ties to community there is 
something that Larry sees changing as he moves into doing more management 
and they begin reaching out to more community organizations and suppliers. 
At their company, it's been nice to see that they are wanting to focus more on the 
equity work of changing the food system and not have it be a 
white vision-
centered change. How do they bring more BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, people of 
color) farmers into their supply chain? For Larry, it's especially important to look 
out for other Asian farmers. He is happy not to grow napa cabbage at all if that 
means another farm in Orange County (New York) can sell all of their napa to 
Dig's restaurants. Finding other minority farmers and bringing them into their 
supply chain is something that Larry is working on now and sees growing over 
the next few years. 
However, there are certainly a 
lot of challenges faced by minority-owned farms. 
Larry was talking to the son of a 
Korean farmer the other day, and he told Larry 
that it's very isolating for his father. His father doesn't know English very well, 
and he can't really talk to his neighbors. It's always just been him, alone, on his 
farm doing his thing. Larry says you have this isolation, especially for the older 
generation, that makes it difficult to reach out. There is also difficulty in accessing 
capital and equipment. They see that a 
lot with Spanish farmers. Dig's farm buys 
all of its farm equipment and supplies from the Amish in Pennsylvania, but it's 
difficult for these other farmers to be able to purchase supplies from there even 
though they are low-priced and well-made. Because accessing that is difficult, so 
is scaling up and doing it efficiently. Even being able to purchase the sprays and 
chemicals you need to use requires a 
lot of paperwork. 
If these farms can't scale up because of these barriers to entry, how can they 
participate in a 
bigger way in our food chain? Chris Newman at Sylvanaqua 
Farms thinks it's great that small farms are competing in the local marketplace, 
but it's tiny. It's a 
fraction of what the food system is. How can they participate in 
a 
federal contract? How can they get their farms to be able to scale and do so 
ethically? How can they raise up these minority farmers so they can participate in 
changing the food system? That's what really interests Larry. How can they help 
these people build their farms to do that? Is it grants or education? At Dig, they're 
still trying to figure it out, but it's something they're thinking about very deeply.

Larry didn't know any farmers growing up. He grew up in the suburbs of 
Boston and went to a 
U-pick farm every now and then. Farming was not 
something Larry grew up around. He went to a 
dual-county high school, so it 
had students from a 
couple different towns. One town was more rural, and 
some kids would make fun of them and call them farmers. Farming was not 
something everyone knew Larry would do. It just turned out that that was 
what happened. 
Larry's dad was always really into gardening. He grew Chinese chives in the 
backyard. Although that's not the reason Larry became a 
farmer, growing your 
own food was always there in the background. 
1:10:19 
Larry didn't know any other Asian American farmers when he got into food 
and farming. He knew of a 
few when he was a 
buyer, and there are a 
few 
Korean-owned farms at Union Square that sell beautiful produce. Larry tried 
to grow a 
certain kind of Korean pickling cucumber that he would buy from 
a 
farm at Union Square when he was a 
buyer, but he wasn't able to do it 
successfully. He will still go to Union Square to see what those farms are 
growing. They have a 
wider latitude in being able to grow all of these 
specialty things, so it's always interesting to see what they have. When Larry 
was in rural Pennsylvania, he says he was probably the only Asian person for 
miles. 
1:12:31 
Not knowing any other Asians in food and agriculture influenced Larry's 
decision to move to New York. Because it was so difficult to find good 
Chinese food in Pennsylvania, Larry wanted to be somewhere closer to a 
Chinese supermarket. He still has to drive an hour to go to one, but for some 
reason it feels a 
lot more manageable now than when he lived in 
Pennsylvania. 
One of Larry's best friends from college got him into farming. When Larry 
was a 
buyer in New York, he lived in the City for a 
year. Eventually, he was 
looking to get out. At the restaurant, he answered directly to their chef and 
owner. He knew he wouldn't be either of those things, so he decided it was the 
end of the line for him there. His college friend, who is Korean, was working 
on a 
farm in Pennsylvania, and he invited Larry to come and check it out. 
Larry went, liked it, and stayed. This friend is now Larry's assistant manager 
at Dig. 
Lawrence Tse Interview Log, December 29, 2020

When people see that the management are both Asian, they assume it's an 
Asian farm and everyone there is Asian, which is not true. Larry says it's good 
to challenge those stereotypes. Larry's friend studied Chinese in school, so he 
knows a 
lot more about Chinese culture and food and speaks Mandarin. They 
can both embrace their heritage but not have it be an Asian-only farm. 
When Larry was in middle and high school, he didn't want to be thought of as 
Chinese. He was an American. When you're younger and don't have the 
historical context of your heritage and how your parents got to America and 
you're mostly thinking about yourself and your place, assimilation and being 
American means being an unambiguous part of the fabric. 
Larry didn't live in a 
particularly nice town socioeconomically speaking, and 
his mother started working at the neighboring school system so they could go 
there. It was an excellent school system, and it was very wealthy and very 
white. The other Chinese friends he had were in this very wealthy, very white 
town and school. They all felt the same way. They didn't want to be thought 
of as Chinese or as Asian. They just wanted to be thought of as another 
person. 
Larry and his friends all had this same journey on a 
similar timeline, and they 
began to very radically embrace their heritage. They thought about placing 
their heritage and ancestry as a 
core part of themselves rather than it being the 
part they want to push away. Larry feels somewhat similar in his farming 
journey. At the beginning, you're thinking about production and economics. 
However, as Larry has gone on this journey and grown as a 
farmer, he knows 
he wants to grow other things and use the farm to serve his community. 
It has become much more important to him to think about how they can use 
the tools they're privileged to have outside of just being an efficient restaurant 
farm. Larry says some of that comes from being a 
manager and having a 
larger sense of ownership of the operation. You can't do that when you're just 
working on a 
farm. It's certainly a 
bigger part of how Larry thinks about 
farming now. 
1:20:45 
Larry talks about what he's most proud of in his work as a 
farmer. That 
moment of selling vegetables to the Chinese supermarket is a 
highlight of his 
career. Being able to send that photo of it in the bag to his dad was really 
special. Since Larry began working at Dig, he wanted to create this incubator 
program. They're in such a 
unique place with the leadership of their company 
being so willing to invest money into the farm without necessarily seeing a 
financial return. Obviously there are other returns, including the marketing 
aspect and that it draws a 
lot of talent to the organization. 
Lawrence Tse Interview Log, December 29, 2020

The incubator is really special. Larry sees farming as a 
way to save people's 
lives. There are a 
lot of people who come to farms because they don't know 
what else to do with their life. They don't know what direction they want to 
take their lives, and they go to work on a 
farm because it sounds like a 
nice 
way to spend a 
summer. Larry has seen a 
lot of people come into farming and 
find a 
purpose. That's why it's so important to him that the farm serves an 
educational purpose. Dig wants to give people something to love, for them to 
become good at it, and to build a 
business and a 
life around that. 
It's scary to lose a 
job or to graduate and be unsure of whether you want to go 
into a 
certain field. For some people, that answer is farming. It is a 
really 
special thing to see their incubators start their businesses, be able to support 
themselves, and get the opportunity they didn't think was there. Most of the 
people that have joined their incubator never thought about starting their own 
business, but here they are. They did it. One of the guys from the 2020 
incubator had sales that were almost equivalent to Larry's, and Larry's farm is 
twenty times the size of his. To see them be able to make it is really gratifying. 
1:25:51 
Larry advises other BIPOC who are trying to get into farming not to sell 
themselves short. You deserve a 
good life. Don't put your labor on sale, 
because it's worth more. Larry finds that people still continue to be underpaid, 
and they're afraid to ask for more and for a 
better life when they're working at 
these places. It never hurts to ask. Larry always tells people they shouldn't be 
working for ten dollars an hour. You shouldn't be volunteering at places. You 
should be compensated for your work, because it's hard work. 
It is really intimidating to go back to your community to sell product, even if 
it's one that you're comfortable in. Larry grew up in Chinatowns and was very 
comfortable going to Chinatown. He's very comfortable going to a 
restaurant 
and ordering in Chinese, but to sell and be on the other side is very nerve-
racking. He was always somewhat hesitant about his conversational skills, 
although perhaps less so than other people. He says you wouldn't make fun of 
someone for their English, so people aren't going to make fun of you if it's 
difficult for you to communicate. 
Larry remembers when he first went to Essex Market, and they found out he 
was second-generation. They then understood why he talks the way he does. 
At the end of the day, the worst thing someone can say is that they don't want 
to buy your product. It's always worth asking. It's worth stopping by a 
kitchen 
at the end of your meal to see if there's opportunity. The worst anyone is 
going to say is no. Larry has gotten many accounts just from eating at a 
restaurant and then talking to someone afterwards. 
Lawrence Tse Interview Log, December 29, 2020

You have to persevere, and it gets better. It always gets better. As you get 
better at what you do and grow your business, you will have more time to 
focus on your vision and what you want to do. This isn't necessarily 
applicable only to BIPOC farmers. A 
lot of people believe that smaller is 
better and that they have to serve only the finest vegetables that cost thirty 
dollars a 
pound, but that's not true. If you grow your business, you have time 
to do other things as well. Don't be afraid to get bigger. Don't be limited by a 
micro-farm, or any of the other paradigms that we've been taught by the old 
masters. 
The climate and educational sphere that Larry trained in was very focused on 
how you make a 
lot of money on a 
small amount of land. It doesn't have to be 
that way. He's not saying go big or go home, but there are other ways to do 
this. It doesn't have to be the same way every other young farmer is going. It's 
okay to want to sell on a 
commodity market and to have management and 
different hierarchies and structures. Otherwise, it's going to be all white 
people doing it. If you don't want to play this game, other people will. 
1:32:39 
Larry talks about changes he would like to see take place on his own farm and 
more broadly across the food system. Dig wants to hire and grow their BIPOC 
crews, and there are legally certain things they can and can't do. They want to 
have a 
more diverse crew moving forward, and it's difficult because of hiring 
limitations. They also want their incubator to be diverse. 
It's a 
difficult thing to think about how to serve the Asian community. Their 
hubs are their grocery stores. Larry has many memories of grocery stores as 
very special places. How do they give people the option to purchase locally 
grown Asian vegetables that aren't necessarily from the grocery store? The 
grocery stores are old, family-owned businesses that have been in those 
communities for a 
very long time. Larry doesn't think opening a 
farmers 
market is going to kill a 
grocery store. There are a 
lot of people who will 
continue to buy at those hubs. 
He would like to see more interaction with farmers and their communities in 
the cities and elsewhere. Christina (Chan) is packaging CSAs for the Asian 
community, which is very cool. If there are more people who are focused on 
serving their community and creating CSA boxes and markets that are geared 
to that, it could grow. It may not be their elders who are first to jump in line, 
but they could get there. If the second generation is doing it, and the elders see 
the vegetables that someone like Christina is growing, that could turn them on 
to also participating in a 
new economy. That would be an amazing thing, but 
we have to get more Asian farmers out there first. 
Lawrence Tse Interview Log, December 29, 2020

In a 
broader sense, Larry would love to see seed companies stop using the 
word "oriental." There are obviously legal things that need to happen with 
particular varieties, and for some, like the eggplant Orient Express, Larry 
knows there are legal reasons that the name can't be changed. Even saying 
"Asian vegetables" lumps together all of these different countries that have 
different foodways. 
1:38:33 
Larry doesn't think the pandemic is necessarily the catalyst for thinking about 
his Chinese American identity and how it intersects with his work. The last 
four years of demonizing China have been difficult for their community and 
for people of Chinese descent. Larry isn't saying the Communist Party is an 
angel. Talking about it economically, there are problems with how China 
competes on a 
world-scale. Larry thinks that there is certainly a 
geopolitical 
argument about America and its economy and influence versus China's. 
The pandemic is just three years of demonizing an entire group of people 
coming to a 
head. Calling China an economic rival is different than calling it 
an enemy. Continuously using racist, xenophobic terms to describe the 
pandemic and all of the disinformation that went along with it is difficult to 
hear. There is not enough outreach to the Chinese community by the 
government of this country, or by political parties or the powers that be. It's a 
group that might not vote that often, but it's because no one has reached out. If 
people want things to change, to win elections, create new bases of power, and 
expand their influence, they have to begin reaching out to these communities 
to see what is important to them. 
It's not even that the Chinese political bloc is taken for granted. It's just 
assumed that they're not there. It's an enormous amount of people who have 
been ridiculed, treated poorly, and discriminated against, and no one seems to 
care. People express outrage when President Trump says "Kung Flu" or the 
"China Virus," but at the end of the day, it's not like you've done anything for 
Chinese communities either. 
Larry says that a 
large, vibrant, and beautiful Chinatown in Boston is 
continuously being chipped away at. Every year, new buildings are put in and 
others are torn down or replaced. Apartments are put in where restaurants used 
to be. No one cares that it's an important part of the Chinese people, the 
diaspora, and the story of how many people came to this country. It's sad and 
upsetting to see their communities being removed and thrown aside. There is a 
lot of anger and sadness there and a 
lot of will for political action, but no one 
has done the outreach to tap into it. Larry would love to see that happen.
