START OF RECORDING 
 
M.L. Smoker:  M.L. Smoker, Fort Peck Assiniboine and Sioux. I am most rooted in my home 
community on the Miníšoše in northeastern Montana on the Canadian and North Dakota 
border. I am one of two co-poets laureate for the state of Montana. I am also an Indian 
education advocate who works around the country for equity and inclusion and better 
outcomes for our American Indian youth.  
 
[M.L. Smoker reads “The Book of the Missing, Murdered and Indigenous – Chapter 1”] 
 
MLS:  “The Book of the Missing, Murdered and Indigenous – Chapter 1” was written by M.L. 
Smoker and read in Helena, Montana, on July 19, 2020. This poem serves as an 
acknowledgement that we—primarily as Indigenous women—see, feel and long for our stolen 
sisters, our family members who go missing on dark roads or from their homes, and too many 
other terrible circumstances. We resist the violence and oppression that we face on a daily 
basis. We will not be made invisible in this country anymore. We will fight. We will advocate. 
We will search and we will never give up on those who are missing, who are lost, who have 
been taken from us.  
 
This poem was also inspired by Molly Murphy Adams, Oglala and Lakota, and her art piece 
entitled Epicenter and Impact. I also dedicate this poem to the memory of my niece, Natalie 
Smoker.
