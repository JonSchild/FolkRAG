SONGSTER. 
Rolling Home in the Morning, Boys. 
As sung by James H. McGuire, comic vocalist. 
am of a 
school of boys who're always gay and free. 
And good for any little game, whatever it may be; 
For fun at night is our delight, and then let come 
what may, 
We never think of going home until the break of 
day. 
CHORUS. 
Rolling home in the morning, boys, in the morning, 
boys, in the morning, boys. 
Rolling home in the morning, boys, before the 
break of day. 
At eight o'clock we start from home, and then our 
pals we meet, 
We " Tommy Dodd" for glasses round, or some 
one stands a 
treat; 
If once we enter dancing rooms, we never leave 
again, 
Until we've wound the evening up with glorious 
Champagne. 
Rolling home,-etc. 
8 
ROLLING HOME IN THE MORNING, 
Uproarious we sally forth, a 
lot of jolly sparks, 
To chaff the cabbies and police, who grin at all our 
larks. 
We don't indulge in foolish tricks, house-bells we 
never ring, 
But " Up in a 
Balloon, Boys," we don't forget to 
sing. 
• 
Rolling home, etc. 
Of course, when we reach home, my boys, it's diffi-
cult to see 
The number of the house, or even—where to find 
the key; 
And when the morning breaks, we are so queer 
about the head, 
We wonder how we staggered home, and found the 
way to bed. 
Rolling home, etc. 
But here my sorrows do not end, for when I 
call to 
see 
The little darling of my heart—she's not polite to 
me; 
She's heard how I 
went on last night, it's useless to 
explain; 
And so I 
promise—till next time, I'll not roll home 
again. - . 
Rolling home, etc.

Down the Hill.

BOYS, SONGSTER. 
Keep a 
tight rein in your hand, 
Or you may get a

And mind and put the break on, 
When you're going down the hill. 
CHORUS. 
'7 ; 
For life's a 
rugged journey, 
Let men say what they will, 
So mind and put the break on. 
When you're going down the hill 
The world is always moving, 
And man is not allowed 
To loiter by the wayside, 
But must go with the crowd. 
Who travel on life's dreary way,' 
To bring grist to the mill, . 
But he's bound to put the break on 
When he's going down the hill. 
For life's, etc. 
The fastest race is soonest run 
Upon the great highway 
Of life—as folks discover, 
• If they travel night and day 
The road is sometimes level, 
But in spite of strength and skill, 
You're bound to put the break on 
When you're coing down the 
For life's, etc.

Many travel on so fast,

Harvard Joe. 
As sang by James H. McGuire, comic vocalist. 
I 
from Harvard College hail, 
I'm an under-graduate, 
Up to ey'ry little game, 
Wide-a- wake I 
beg to state; , 
Bing of fashions I 
Harvard's pet I 
Of my College I'm the beau, 
Though my name is Joseph, 
Yet I 
am known as Harvard Joe. 
CHORUS. 
Harvard Joe, Harvard Joe, 
I 
am known as Harvard Joe, 
Harvard Joe, Harvard Joe, 
Yes, I'm known as Harvard Joe. 
In the merry cricket field, 
Tho' opponents seem to win, 
Bat in hand, I 
bide my time, 
Wait till Harvard Joe goes in ; 
10 
.ztoLLING HOME IN THE MORNING, 
Play is cried, I 
lift my bat, 
Be the bowling swift or slow, 
Run, and run again, lost ball, 
That's the style for Harvard Joe. 
Harvard Joe, etc. 
On the Isis I'm at home, 
Though the training is severe; 
In the lemons rowing match, 
Joseph's with them, never fear; 
When we're pitted 'gainst the " Cams," 
Straining every nerve we'll row, 
May the best men win, I 
say, 
All's fair Play with Harvard Joe. 
Harvard Joe, etc. 
When in town, to Billiard rooms, 
Joseph's footsteps often stray, - 
When -he's ask'd to join in pool, 
Harvard Joseph says not nay, 
Sharpers try to pick him up, 
Thinking they've a 
flat in tow, 
But at pool he cleans them out, 
All the pull's with Harvard Joe. 
Harvard Joe, et; 
Dodge the Proctor and his dogs, 
Who our morals overlook, - 
Bless their innocence, I 
say, 
Joseph's never brought to book. 
Give me life in Harvard town 
Where the mighty " Tom " you know, 
Booms the hundred and the one; 
Harvard is the place for Joe.

Mind you give a 
friendly call, 
If you should to Harvard go, 
Always glad to see you all, 
Please to ask for Harvard Joe. -

Up a Tree. 
As sung by James H. McGuire, comic. vocalist. 
You see before you one who's been in life, thro' 
many a 
changing scene, 
And yet withal a 
little green, of course, I 
know 
it now; 
Altho' I've been unfortunate, you will allow me to 
relate, 
That once I 
own'd a 
large estate, ' twas then 
friends used to bow: 
"Dear Jack, old boy," they then would say, " I'm 
proud of such a 
meeting, 
How do you do? where have you been ? 
You're 
looking well, I 
see." 
But now they've grown so very shy, they can't 
afford a 
greeting, 
(In vulgar phraseology), because I'm " Up a 
Tree." 
• 
r 
CHORUS. 
I'd friends in great variety; who courted my iociety, 
Came to dine, drank my wine, shook my hand 
with glee, 
--- - 
I 
might walk from now till Whitsuntide, but when 
they see me,,off they glide, 
And pass me on the other side, because I'm " Up 
a 
Tree." . 
12 
ROLLING HOME IN THE MORNING, 
I 
once could give good dinners, ah, ' twas then the 
-hungry sinners, 
Would haunt my table daily, praise my judgment, 
jokes, and wine, 
Join in conviviality, accept my hospitality, 
Until thro' prodigality my fortune did decline; 
And so did they, for one by one, they left we in my 
glory. 
A 
friend I 
stood in need of, but not one could I 
see, 
My money gone, and so had they; well, ' tis the 
same old story; 
So while you have it keep it, or you'll soon be 
" 
Up a 
Tree." 
I 
once could drive my four•in-hand, had money, 
too, at my command, 
Could " do the grand," you understand, how fool-
ish I 
have been; 
I 
stand here to exemplify, " Sweet uses of adver-
sity," 
To prove my friends in poverty, acquaintances I 
mean. 
Better times may come again, a 
lesson ' twill have 
taught me. 
"Preserve me from my friends," for the future it 
shall be, 
I've paid for my experience, tho' you see to what 
it's brought me, 
I'm a 
sadder, yet a 
wiser man, altho' I'm " Up a 
Tree."

The Fisherman's Daughter. 
As sung by James H. MeGuire, comic vocalist. 
I've been caught in a 
net, by a 
dear little pet, 
And her eyes are as blue as the deep rolling sea; ; 
She's a 
fisherman's daughter, she lives o'er the 
water, 
And she's going to be married next Sunday to me. 
She's as rare as the salmon, there's really no gam-
mon, 
As sweet as shrimps newly served up for tea. 
My soul she has caught, and a 
place I 
have bought, 
Where a 
ray of bright sunshine forever will be. 
CHORUS. 
She's a 
fisherman's daughter, she lives o'er the 
. water. 
She's going to be married next Sunday to me. 
She's a 
fisherman's daughter, she lives o'er the 
water, 
She's going to be married next Sunday to me. 
She's bare-footed and pretty, she's lively and witty, 
She sings her wild songs to the murmuring sea; 
She'll dance on the sand where the fishermen stand, 
And join in the music of a 
wild swelling glee. 
She site in her boat, and sings o'er the billow, 
And flirts with the spray like a 
sea-skimming gull; 
She laughs at the winds whose revels are music, 
And beats to the time with the stroke of her scull. 
She's a 
fisherman's daughter, etc. 
The bells they shall ring, and the sailors shall sing, 
Y'heave ho I. Yleave ho, boys, for time's on the

To see pretty Sarah, the pride of the sea, 
Who's going to be married next -Sunday to me. 
Her hair I 
will deck with a 
wreath of bright sea-
weed, 
I'll plant in her bosom a 
blooming moss-rose, 
She shall go like a 
fay with sweet- tinkling music, 
With rings on her fingers and bells on her toes: 
She's a 
fisherman's daughter, etc. 
Everybody's Friend 
As sung by James H. McGuire, comic vocitlist. • 
A 
happy, careless chap am I, and boast where e'er 
I 
go, 
That tho' I 
have made many friends, I've not a 
single foe. 
To be a 
genius I 
do not, and never did pretend, 
But move in good society, as everybody's friend. 
SPOKEN.—" And having lots of cash." 
CHORUS. 
They take me for a 
millionaire, my cash I 
freely 
spend, 
And so I'm welcom'd everywhere, as everybody's 
friend, 
A 
mother once with sixteen girls, to me thus did 
apply: 
" 
Watch and protect my darling dears, so timid, 
young and shy." 
She said, " Tho' once I 
really thought you marriage 
did intend," 
Then a 
breach of promise action brought 'gainst 
everybody's friend.

A 
married man.said, "Jack, my wife and I 
don't 
quite agree," 
The wife she whispered in my ear, " He treats me 
shamefully." 
I 
gave the best advice to each, and of course, why 
in the end, 
They made it up., and kicked me out, and now I'm 
neither's friend. 
SroEws.—The husband was indignant, because I 
took her part; and the wife, precisely for the same 
reason, called me a " nasty wretch.' 
But I 
don't

They take me, etc. 
A 
friend of mine once bought a 
house somewhere 
• 
close to Rye, 
And meeting me one day, said he, " A 
fool I 
was 
to buy, 
The walls are damp, the windows shake, and burg-
lars oft attend; 
Dear Jack, do take it off my hands, you're every-
body's•friend." 
SPOKEN.—I 
did, and I 
hadn't been in the house 
three nights, when burglars broke in, and took 
every stick I 
had; and the last ruffian, as he de- , 
ecended. the stairs, and got outside of the house, 
looked np to me, at the window, and said: " I 
say, -

Popsy Wopsy. 
As sung by James H. McGuire, comic 'vocalist. 
I 
am an 'elpless female, 
An unprotected female, 
My husband's been and gone, 
And run away, my heart to wring; 
He's gone to join the Mormons, 
Those gay and festive Mormons, 
And while he's getting married there, 
I'm left alone to sing. 
CHORUS. 
Oh my Popsy Wopsy's vanished from my sight. 
And we might have been so happy, so we might I 
But now he's gone away to be a 
Alormonite, 
And I've no doubt but what he'll have a 
dozen 
wives or more. 
He had a 
winning manner, 
A 
most engaging manner, 
And when we wed I 
never thought 
He'd come to serve me so; 
But he was so deceitful— 
The men are all deceitful— 
They bring poor girls like me to grief, 
And that's as well to know. 
Oh my Popsy Wopsy, etc. 
But I 
mean to go and join him, 
lo on the sly and join him

And stop at once his fun. 
As soon as I 
can reach him,

Tho' he may have a 
dozen wives, 
Still I 
am Number One. 
Oh my Popsy Wopsy, etc. 
Now ladies, take a 
warning, 
Let my fate be a 
warning; 
The men are all a 
sort of kind 
Of Blue Beard, and not true; 
But if they will neglect us, 
To love they can't expect us; 
For what is sauce for goose, you know, 
Is sauce for gander. too.

I'm so fond of Dancing.. 
As sung by James H. McGuire, comic vocalist. 
Oh I'm so fond of dancing, 
And I 
love the music so, 
When the dancers are advancing, 
That I 
never can say, " No1' 
When I 
see all eyes grow brighter, 
Keeping time with every glance, 
And all hearts are growing lighter, 
I'm crazy for the dance.

And I 
love the old Quadrille,

Anything but standing still: 
Fiddles playing, bugles blowing, 
Feet are never out of tune; 
And I 
feel my spirits flowing, 
Like a 
rivulet in June. 
Bring the Lancers, etc. 
With a 
single moment's warning, 
To be ready for the ball, 
I 
can dance from night till morning, 
Or until the ceilings fall; 
And when the world is sleeping, 
And the stars begin to peep, 
In my dreams my art I'm keeping, 
For I'm dancing in my sleep.

must be number one. 
So it's no, etc. 
My horsemanshin is much admir'd, 
When in the Park I

Of waltzing I

So gracefully I

Arid who can wonder at it., when 
They know I'm number one.

Alone at play or ball, 
Five hundzed pounds a-year my lot,

The Iturdy Gurdy Lad. 
As sung by James H. McGuire, comic vocalist. 
I 
don't feel very happy, nor I 
don't feel very sad, 
So put me down as middling, although it is too 
bad 
For any girl to serve a 
chap, as lately I've been 
served; 
But no girl shall take me in again, I'll never take 
their word. 
A girl I 
courted for six months, her Christian 
name was Fanny, 
I 
asked her if she have me, and she said she would 
be glad, 
But at present her intention was to stay at home 
• with her mammy. 
And she couldn't think of parting with her dear 
old darling dad..

To go and leave her mammy,

To go and leave her dad; 
But she's run away from both, 
My false, deceitful Fanny, 
And travels ebout the country, 
With e 
Hurdy Gurdy Lad. 
Now Fanny wasn't handsome, but I 
thought she 
was sincere, 
And then she had such winning ways, that made 
me her revere, 
But a 
hurdy gurdy, grinder, he used to come our 
way,- , • , 
And for Fanny's recreation, for hours he used to 
play, 
He'd play awhile, then dance a 
bit, and then he'd 
sing a 
ditty,

Once I'd money plenty, 
' 
And friends, too, by the score, 
Then fortune smiled upon me, 
'And no one passed my door. 
Now I'm poor and lonely, 
And not worth half a 
crown; 
No one seems to know me, 
I'm completely broken down.

wander thro' the world, 
And meet with many a 
frown, 
No one seems to know me now,

Because I'm broken down. 
With" in ample fortune, 
I 
went it rather fast, 
The pace was almost killing, 
And I 
found it couldn't last.

Come back Aroon to the land of thy birth; 
Come with the shamrock and springtime, mavour-

And it's Killarney shall ring with our mirth. 
Sure when we lent ye to beautiful England, 
Little we thought of the lone winter days, 
Little we thought of the hush of the starshine, 
Over the mountains, the bluffs, and the brays. 
Come back-, etc.

rAs sung by James EL McGuire, comic vocalist. 
In sailing along the river of life, 
Over its waters wide, 
We all have to battle with trouble and strife, 
And wait for the time and the tide. 
Men, of each other, are prone to be jealous, 
Hopes ara illusions— are not what they seem t 
Life and its pleasures, philosophers tell us, 
Go floating away like a 
leaf on a 
stream.

And Rome wasn't built in a

So wait for the turn of the tide. 
Why people sit fretting their lives away, 
I 
can't tor a 
moment surmise; 
If " Life is a 
lottery," as they say, 
We cannot all turn up a 
prize. 
A 
folly it is to be sad and dejected; 
If Fortune shows favors, she's fickle beside, 
And may knock at your door &line fine day un-
expected 
If you patiently wait for the turn of the tide. 
Then try, etc. 
Man is sent into the world, we are told, 
To clo all the good that he can;

distance, 
Hold up your head tho' your funds are but 
Once let the world know you need its assistance, 
Be sure then you never will get it at all.

At a

She is the sweetest treasure all round, near or far, 
And to speak the truth I

They talk and drink, just to look large, and fancy 
they're A

But thay have not half a 
chance with little Flora.

Pretty little Flora serves behind the bar, 
Selling Flanagan's ale and porter;

For it grieves my heart' to leave my little Flora. 
How I

stand, 
The proudest of the proud, and the grandest of the

And soon I'll place the gold ring upon her tiny

She wants no " Bloom of Youth," her skin it is so

And in a 
brooch she carries me before her; 
We've named the happy day, so I 
am right for life,

So am I

BOYS, SONGSTER,

The way that I 
won her is strange, you will say; 
'Twas one afternoon that I 
went to Bellevue, 
A young friend of mine was there for the day, 
And took little Polly for whom he'd to pay; 
When first we met I 
soon could see, 
That with his chance ' twas all U. P., 
And so I 
asked her if she'd have me, 
This beautiful Lancashire Lass. 
My Lancashire, etc. 
She said " she'd be mine," and swore to be true; 
We've since been like doves, billing and cooing! 
We never fall out as some lovers do, 
And she has some money, betwixt me and you; 
She bought this watch which now I 
wear, 
If she don't mind, well I 
don't care, 
She says " that her fortune I 
shall share," 
My beautiful Lancashire Las.. 
My Lancashire, etc. 
She published the bans, we're going to be wed, 
I 
leave those matters for her to settle, 
To- morrow, for time so quickly has fled, 
The Lancashire Lass to the church will be led; 
I 
need not work whilst there's a 
purse, 
To the idea I'm not averse, 
And perhaps one day I 
may have to nurse 
A 
sweet little Lancashire Lass. 
Ny Lancashire, etc.

ROLLING HOME IN THE MORNING, 
Never Push a Man when He's Go. 
lug, Down the Hill. 
As sung by Frank Van Hem. 
In this sensation century, 
Good songs are very few, 
The words are little coed for, 
If the music it is new ; 
And subjects they are hard to find, 
But I 
have found one still, 
That's " Never push a 
man because 
lie's going down the hill." 
CHORUS. 
Then help one another, boys, 
Should fortune on you shine, 
Remember, when you give your mite, 
That " poverty's no crime!" 
Though little be the offering, boys, 
Give it, with good will, 
But never push a 
man, because 
lie's going down the hill. 
In this wide world there's many a 
man 
With brave and honest. heart, 
Who, to raise his wife and family, 
In business makes a 
start; • 
But still his ends don't seem to meet, 
Work which way be will, 
Fate seems to be against him, 
And—he's going down the hill. 
Then help, etc. 
As we journey on in daily life, 
How many men we find, 
That Poverty's a 
grievous sin, 
To think they are inclinid. 
BOYS, SONGSTER. 
They meet in sad adversity, 
, 
Some old friend, Tom or Bill, 
And pass him by disdainfully, 
As he's.going down the hill. 
Then help, etc. 
Shnuld e'er you meet an honest man,. 
Struggling on with fate., 
•
Ne'er speak words of discouragement, 
Nor tell him ' tis " Too late I" 
Don't sneer as you pass by film, 
But help him with a 
will, 
And p'rhaps some day you'll meet him 
On the summit of the hill.

For there's noble hearts in Erin, 
Where the grass grows green.

'Tis true he has a 
weakness 
For a 
drop of something pure, 
But that's a 
slight debility,

Though his wit '

For there's feeling hearts in Erin, - 
Where the grass grows green.

Once in the spring-time of my life, 
When all around was clear, 
There came a

Her mother, too, is dead.

Were all the words she said.

And led her to the door; 
Ah 
bitterly we both did weep, 
As never wept before; 
She raised her little hand, and cried, 
"Can this be true they're dead, 
Oh, would my time was come to die l"

The seeds of true love sowed.

At one halfpenny the lot.

She agreed to be his bride, 
And every Sunday afternoon 
He'd take her for a

Till he came across a 
pretty girl, 
One day, and on her grew sweet, 
She was barmaid at a 
public-house, 
Somewhere near Fenchurch Street. 
And he cries, etc. 
He gave the widow turnips, 
To which she did object, 
And she was heard to hope one day, 
That he might break his neck. 
She told the other girl such stuff, 
And painted him so black, 
That this poor deluded feminine 
Gave Charley Crank the sack. 
And he cries, etc. 
When Charley found she'd give him 
With rage he got quite blue, 
And as he rode upon his bus, 
He knew not what to do; 
But to have his revenge on the widow, 
Although it was so small, 
He drove his bus against the kerb, 
And upset her apple stall.

Penal Servitude. 
Air.—" Tapioca." 
As sung by James H. McGuire, comic vocalist. 
As on my little game you've put a 
stopper, 
For a 
time they've collared all in vain, 
If I 
cannot earn an honest copper, 
I'm in for penal servitude again. 
CHORUS. 
Where they feed you., and they clothe you, 
Better than a 
workingman, or stabiles—

ROLLING HOME IN THE MORNING, 
Oh! me, oh! my! 
Penal servitude is the sort of life for me; 
Then we do a 
bit of work, just a 
portion of the day 
And then we go to church upon a 
Sunday, oh, 
Man oh! my yar, yar, yar, yar, 
Give me penal servitude before the Union. 
Here's to be a 
deal of reformation, 
About reform you've often heard a 
fuss; 
And while you keep your paupers in starvation„ 
You are sure to be surrounded with coves like us. 
The bobbies sometimes are very useful, 
He can be either absent, deaf or blind; 
And if you're collar'd with a 
handful, 
A 
comfortable home you're sure to find. 
There is one little dodge, I 
am thinking, 
That would knock our profession all to smash— 
It would put on the kibosh like winking, 
That is if they was to introduce the lash. 
But still I 
can't help laughing, 
When I 
see your paupers look so pale; 
There's thousands in the workhouse starving, 
While we live like lords in the jail. 
It was cracking of a 
crib that they naird me, 
The swag was worth a 
thousand to me; 
From business I 
thought of retiring, when they col-
lar'd me, 
And sent me across the sea. 
I 
have just arrived from Australia, 
Where I 
have been for change of air; 
And, chaps, I 
have just come to tell you 
That there is a 
lot of jolly living over there.

Four years ago, at the Old Bailey, 
The jury , found me guilty, I

For ten years across the sea they sent me, 
But I

If when home you are returning, 
if a 
bobby sees you, he is on your track, 
Prevents you getting an honest living, 
So to your old trade you must go back. 
Don't put your Foot on a Man when 
he's D OWD. 
As sung by Frank Melville, comic vocalist. 
Society's ways in these curious days, 
Needs much alteration, I'm sure, 
For seldom you'll see that rich folks agree, 
With those whom misfortune made poor, 
Now this must be wrong if there's truth in my 
song, 
For a 
man may be worthy though poor, 
Then give him a 
lift that he may make a 
shift, 
To keep off the wolf from his door. 
CHORUS. 
Then I 
give this advice, entreating you won't 
On your heel turn away with a 
frown, 
When a 
poor fellow needs it, assist him, but don't 
Put your foot on a 
man when he's down. 
The poor laboring man, who tries all he can, 
To battle his way through life's throng, 
Oft finds to his cost, that cold winter's frost 
Impedes much his getting along.

Something to put by from their trade,

Given way 'neath the world's heavy cares, 
For want of a

Whose fortune's been brighter than thir's

Induced by sad poverty keen, 
That might have been stayed, had an effort been

Before he'd such misery seen.

Misfortune's sold shade visits every grade, 
The rich man as well as the poor, 
Then hesitate not while wealth you have got, 
To help whom you can from your store.

Your hope's fairest prospects to smother, 
You'll surely find then, kind, good-hearted men, 
To help you as you've helped some other.

My modest heart it shocks; 
To casinos oft and oft we went, 
We were partial both to hops. 
To disregard her august' sire, etc. 
ROLLING HOME IN THE MORNLNG, 
But kissing once the lowly clerk, 
The enraged parient catght her; 
When he at once then kicked me out, 
And thrashed his only daughter. 
Then round the brew-er-i she ran, 
It was in vain they sought her; 
The father never more from then 
Cast eyes on his lovely daughter. 
To disregard the antique buffer, etc. 
Full fifteen months had passed away, 
No Ale he brewed or Beer, 
He opened then the brewery, 
But his heart it made so queer. 
For at the bottom of a 
large vat, lay 
Amongst refuse of stale Porter, 
A 
crinoline steel, the busk of a 
stay, 
And the heels of the boots of his daughter. 
To disregard the parental cure, etc. 
Right in the vat she'd fallen flat, 
And thus she found her bier. 
The premises being so long closed, 
Is why they did not see her. 
'Twas strange from when she disappeared, 
The fame rose of the Porter; 
Ah I 
little did the public know 
It was old Brewer's Daughter. 
To disregard the antidiluvian pastor, etc. 
The Gent that has seen Better Days. 
As sung by James H. McGuire, comic vocalist. 
No doubt you all wonder what object this is 
With visage so pale and so wan; 
But spite of appearance and woe-begone phiz,1 
I 
was once a 
respectable man.

BOYS, SONGSTER. 
Fortune once smiled, and gay a.s a 
lark, 
I 
flutter'd from night until morn; 
But now I 
can only steal out after dark, 
My clothes are so tatteed and torn. 
CHORUS. 
In prosperity I 
could have every one's praise, 
But now I'm a 
gent that has seen better days. 
Hot dinners and suppers I 
once used to give, 
Had friends—quite a 
host ( I 
was told) ; 
But now by myself I may sorrow and grieve, 
For my friends, like my suppers, are cold. 
And then, in my chaise, I 
once drove them about, 
To the race- course, the hunt, and review; 
Now my friends—out of kindness, there can be no 
doubt— 
In return they all drive me out, too. 
In prosperity, etc. 
My coat is all threadbare and has but one lap, 
I'm the jest of each impudent youth; 
They say it is sleepy for want of a 
nap— 
Out at elbows, I 
am, in good truth. 
Not a 
crown in my pocket, nor one in my hat 
The showers my only crown pelt, 
My shoes, too, poor soles, don't know what to be at, 
For my toes will peep out at the welt. 
In prosperity, etc. 
As I 
pass by the cookshops, no one can tell 
The terrible craving I 
feel; 
I 
feast on the steam and savorly smell 
But hunger in vain for a 
meal. 
In the window I 
gaze with a 
wistful eye, 
As the joints, boiled and roasted, I 
mark;

ROLLING 1101IE IN THE MORNING, 
Then turning away with a 
heart-rending sigh, 
I 
dine on the trees in the park. 
In prosperity, etc. 
Each former acquaintance I 
happen to meet, 
Conversation with me seems to spurn; 
They cut me at once—passing over the street, 
I 
get nothing to cut in return. 
My landlady, too, clangs hard for her rent, 
In language my very heart loathes; 
And yet to my feelings I 
dare not give vent— 
:. I've no rent but the rent in my clothes. 
In prosperity, etc.
