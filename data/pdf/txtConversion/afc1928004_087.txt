INTRODUCTION. 
Seeing the great want of temperance songs at 
our temperance meetings, I 
have, during my leisure 
hours, tried to write a 
few and adapt them to popu-
lar airs; and from time to time bring them before 
the public. 
They have been well received, and ap-
proved by the officers of the Father Mathew Socie-
ties ; and they requested me to publish them in a 
book, which I 
now propose to do, hoping they will 
be the means of doing some good in the cause cf 
temperance, and help do away with a 
certain class 
of songs that are frequently sung in our halls. 
These songs are most all niy own composition, and 
comprise temperance, national and a 
few sacred 
songs; and a 
few well selected songs from other 
authors. 
I 
hope they will be the means of doing 
some good in the cause of temperance and morality.

On Sumter's walls, near Charleston, 
Defended by brave Anderson 
With Spartan. bravery. 
Every means they sought and tried 
Our glorious Union to divide, 
Seized our forts and laws defied 
To rend our unity. 
They trampled all was good and just, 
Our good old flag trail'd in the dust, 
Our soldiers into prison thrust, 
And Union men to flee. 
Freemen: aroused, armed for the fray, 
To wipe foul treason's stain away, 
God grant we soon will see the day, 
Bring peace and victory.

Brave comrades, all come list to me, your spirits I

I

On picket or at fighting, boys, with spirits gay and 
fine, 
I 
do declare few can compare with gallant ninety-
nine. 
At Big Bethel and New Market Bridge we tried the 
rebel pluck, 
At Hampton Roads our boys was there and to their 
colors stuck ; 
Our lads on board the Congress with valor there 
did shine, 
Worked their guns like noble sons of gallant Ninety-
nine. 
Our brave boys were at Hatteras, Roanoke too, and 
Newbern, 
To Norfolk next we there did go, to give them an-
other turn, 
We landed at Cape Henry, on the beach we formed 
in line, 
The rebs retire from the fire of the gallant Ninety-
nine.

At Norfolk then we did encamp, for near six months 
we lay, 
Then to Deep Creek We started off to drive the robs 
away, 
Through rain and mud we marched along o'er trees 
of fallen pine, 
Hurrah, they come with fife and drum the gallant 
Ninety-nine. 
To Suffolk next we then did go and leave our camp-
ing ground, 
And ordered in the front, brave boys, the rebs did 
us surround, 
We three weeks in the trenches IP,y, in weather rain 
or shine, 
In the rifle- pits we gave them fits, hurrah for Ninety-
nine. 
We lost many gallant comrades on the first_ of 
May, 
Sad to relate_ our loss was great , in that bloody 
fray; 
Full sixty killed and wounded fell out of the line, 
Come drop a 
tear to memory dear, the killed of 
Ninety-nine. 
Now o'er the tomb the flowers bloom of our de-
parted braves, ' 
And sad to tell brave Hart* he fell and fills a 
soldier's

On ,

E'en sweeter then the scented rose.

Ever through life your safest guide,

Your heart keep pure and soul the same.

My Conners, his cheeks are as ruddy as the morn-

The brightest of pearls, they but mimic his

While nature. with ringlets his mild brow adorn-
ing, 
His hair Cupid's bowstrings and roses his breath. 
CHORUS. 
Smiling, beguiling, his cheering endearing, 
Together how oft o'er the mountain we strayed, 
With each other delighted, and fondly united, 
I 
listened all day to my dear Irish boy. 
No roebuck more swifter can flee o'er the moun-
tain, 
No veteran more bolder in danger or scar; 
He's slightly, he's sprightly, as clear as the foun-
tain, 
His eyes sparkle love, and .he's gone to the war. 
Smiling, etc. 
The sweet lark shall change his wild notes to 
mourning, 
The dull screaming owl doth impede my night's 
sleep, 
.I will watch in the evening my Conners returning, 
If he does not come back I 
will ne'er cease to 
weep.

Or some cruel goddess has him captivated, 
And left me to mourn here, his dear Irish maid.

Far, Far upon the Sea. 
Old Song. 
Far, far upon the sea with the good ship speeding 
free, 
On the deck we gathered, young and old, 
To view the flapping sails filling out before the 
gale; 
Full and roun.d without a 
wrinkle or a 
fold. 
Or we watch the waves that glide by our vessel's 
stately side ; 
Or the wild birds follow through the air; 
Or we gather in a 
ring and with cheerful voices 
sing, 
Oh, gayly goes the ship when the wind blows 
fair. 
(Repeat.) 
Far, far upon the sea, what so ere our country be, 
The thoughts ot it will cheer us as we go, 
Scotland's sons will join in the songs of tang -syne, 
Softened by sweet memory clear and low. 
And the sons of Erin's Isle battling sorrows with a 
smile, 
Will sing St. Patrick's morning, void of care; 
And it's thus we pass the day as we journey on our 
way, 
Oh, gayly goes the ship when the wind blows fair.

Far, far upon the sea, with the sun shining on our

We talk of happy days when we were young, 
And remember tho' we roam the sweet melodies of 
home, 
The songs in happy childhood that we sung. 
But tho' we leave our shore to return to it no

For Columbia rules the waves, and we never shall

Remember the Poor. 
Old Song. 
Now winter has come with its cold chilling breath, 
And the verdure has dropt from the trees, 
All nature seems touched with the finger of death, 
And the streams are beginning to freeze. 
Now wanton young lads on the rivers can slide, 
And Flora attends us no more; 
When you've plenty, and sit round a 
good fireside, 
Sure you ought to remember the poor. - 
When the cold feathered snow does in plenty de-
scend, 
And whiten the prospect around, 
When the keen cutting wind from the north shall 
attend 
Hard chilling and freezing the ground; 
When the poor robin-redbreast, approaches your cot, 
When the icicles hang at your door, 
CAPTAIN =ELY'S SONGSTRR. 
27 
When your bowl smokes with something reviving 
and hot, 
That's the time to remember the poor. 
When the poor harmless hare may be traced to the 
wood, 
By her footsteps indented in snow, 
When the lips and the fingers are starting to blood, 
When in danger the traveller does go, 
When the meadows are hid with the proud swelling 
flood, 
When the bridges are useful no more, 
When in health you enjoy everthing that is good, 
Can you grumble to think of the poor? 
Soon a 
day will be here when a 
Saviour was born,, 
All the world should agree as one voice, 
All nations unite to salute the blest man, 
All ends of the earth should rejoice; 
Grim death is deprived of his all- killing sting, 
The grave is triumphant no more, 
Saints, angels, and men hallelujahs will sing, 
And. the rich will remember the poor.

I 
dreamed but last night, 0, bad luck to that dream-

I'd die if I 
thought it would sure come to pass, 
I 
dreamed while the tears down my pillow were 
streaming, 
That Teddy was courting another fair lass. 
Mushla, 0, didn't I 
wake with a 
weeping and wail-

CAPTAIN KELLY'S SONGSTER. 
The grief of that thought was too deep to eon-, 
ceal, 
My mother cries Norah, child, what is your ailing ? 
And all I 
could utter was Teddy O'Neal. 
I 
went to the cabin he danced his wild jigs in, 
As neat a 
mud palace as ever was seen, 
Altho' it served to keep poultry, and pigs in, 
I 
think it was always most elegant clean. 
But now all about it is lonely and dreary, 
All sad, and all silent, no piper or reel, 
Not even the sun thro' the casement is cheery, - 
Since I 
miss my dear darling boy, Teddy O'Neal 
I 
shall never forget when the big ship was ready, 
When me and my true love had for to part, 
I 
sighed like a 
spalpeen, good-bye to you Teddy, 
With tears on my cheeks and a 
stone at my heart. 
He says that to better his fortune he's roving, 
But what would be gold to the joy I 
would feel 
If I 
saw him come back to me honest and loving, 
Still poor bit my own darling Teddy O'Neal. 
1[Ite Crucifixion. 
By Capt. Patrick Kelly. 
Sweet Jesus on the cross we see, 
In bloody sweat and agony, 
A crown of thorns upon his head, 
By sinful man his blood was shed. 
His sacred flesh is rent and torn, 
Then spit upon with hate and scorn; 
Between two thieves the holy Lamb 
Poured out his blood for sinful man. 
The sun refused to give its light, 
Ashamed of man, and well it might;

The moon arid stars in darkness lay,

Oh, precious Lamb for sinners slain, 
Come cleanse my soul from every stain, 
Thou robed in sublime majesty, 
In pity, Lord, look down on me.

CAPTAIN KELLY'S • SONGSTER. 
The Cumberland's Crew, 
Oh I 
shipmates, come gather and join in my ditty; 
It's of a 
terrible battle that happened of late : 
Let each good Union tar shed a 
sad tear of pity, 
. 
When he thinks of the once gallant Cumberland's 
fate. 
The eighth day of March told a 
terrible story, 
And many a 
brave tar to this world bid adieu! 
Yet our flag it was wrapt in a 
mantle of glory 
By the heroic deeds of the Cumberland's crew. 
On that ill-fated day, about ten in the morning, 
The sky it was clear, and bright shone the sun: 
The drums of the Cumberland sounded a 
warning 
That told every seaman to stand by his gun. 
An iron- clad 'frigate down on us came bearing, 
And high in the air the rebel flag flew: 
The pennant of treason she proudly was waving, 
Determined to conquer the Cumberland's crew. 
Then, up spoke our captain with stern resolution, 
Saying, my boys, of this monster now. don't be 
dismayed, 
We swore to maintain our beloved Constitution, 
And to die for our country we are not afraid I 
We fight for the Union, our cause it is glorious, 
To the stars and the stripes we will stand ever 
true. 
We'll sink at our quarters, or conquer victorious! 
Was answered with cheers from the Cumberland's 
crew. 
Now our gallant ship fired her guns' dreadful thun-
, 
der, 
Her broad-side, like hail, on the rebel did pore: 
CAPTAIN KELLY'S SONGSTER. 
31 
The people gazed on, struck with terror and won-
der : 
The shots struck her sides, and glanced harmless 
o'er; 
But the pride of our navy could never be daunted, 
Tho' the dead and the wounded her deck they did 
strew: 
And the flag of our Union how proudly it flaunted, 
Sustained by the blood of the Cumberland's 
crew 
slowly they sunk beneath Virginia's waters, 
Their voices on earth will ne'er be heard more: 
They'll be wept by Columbia's brave sons and fair 
daughters! 
May their blood be avenged on Virginia's shore I 
in that battle-stained grave they are silently lying, 
Their souls have for ever to earth bid adieu! 
But the star-spangled banner above them is flying, 
it was nailed to the mast by the Cumberland's 
crew. 
They fought us three hours, with stern resolution, 
Till those rebels found cannon would never avail 
them : 
For the flag of 
secession has no power to gall 
them, 
Tho' the blood from their scuppers it crimson'd 
the tide; 
She struck us amid-ship, our planks she did sever; 
Her sharp iron prong pierced our noble ship 
through: 
And still, as they sunk on that dark rolling river. 
We'll die at our guns! cried the Cumberland's 
crew. 
32 
CAPTIAN KELLY'S SONGSTER. 
Columbia's sweet birth- right of freedom's commun-
ion, 
Thy flag never floated so proudly before; 
For the spirits of those that died Ior the Union, 
Above its broad folds now exultingly soar I 
And when our sailors in battle assemble, 
God bless our dear banner, the red, white and 
blue 
Beneath its bright stars, we'll cause tyrants #.;)

Or sink at our guns, like the Cumberland's crew 1

A Motto for Every Man. 
Some people you've met in your time no doubt, 
Who never look happy or gay; 
I'll tell you the way to get jolly and stout, 
If you'll listen awhile to my lay. 
I've come here to tell you a 
bit of my mind, 
And please with the same, if 1 
can ; 
Advice, in my song, you will certainly find, 
And a 
motto for every man. 
CHORUS. 
So, we will sing and banish melancholy, 
Trouble may come, we'll do the best we can 
To drive care away; for grieving is a 
folly. 
" 
Put your shoulder to the wheel" is a 
motto 
for every man. 
We cannot all fight in this battle of life, 
The weak must go to the wall ; 
So do to each other the thing that is right, 
For there's room in this world for us all; 
Credit refuse if you've the money to pay, 
You'll find it the wiser plan : 
And " a 
penny lay by for a 
rainy day" 
Is a 
motto for every man. 
So we, etc. 
A coward gives in at the first repulse, - 
A 
brave man struggles again 
With a 
resolute eye, and a 
hounding pulse, 
To battle his way amongst men; 
For he knows he has but one chance, in his time, 
To better himself if he can ; 
So " make your hay while the sun cloth shine" 
Is a 
motto for every man. 
So we, etc.

Economy study, but don't be mean; 
"A penny may lose a

Thro' this world a

Will carry you safe and sound. 
It's all very well to be free, I

To do a

But " charity always commences at home," 
That's a

Where the Grass Grows Green. 
Sung 
with great appaluse by Johnny Daugherty. 
I'm Denny Blake from county Clare, 
And here at your command 
To sing a 
song in praise of home, 
And my own native land. 
I've sailed to foreign countries, 
And in many climes I've been, 
But my heart is still with Erin, 
Where the grass grows green. 
CHORUS. 
I 
love my native country, 
And tho' richer lands I've seen, 
Yet I 
can't forget ould Erin 
Where the grass grows green. 
Poor Pat is often painted 
With a 
ragged coat and hat, 
His heart and hospitality 
Has much to do with that. 
Let slanderers say what they will, 
They cannot call him mean, 
Sure, a 
stranger's always welcome 
Where the grass grows green. 
I 
love, etc. 
36 
CAPTAIN KELLY'S SONGSTER. 
He's foolish, but not vicious, 
His faults I 
won't defend; 
His purse to help the orphan, 
His life to serve a 
friend 
He'll give without a 
murmur; 
So, his follies try and screen, 
For there's noble hearts in Erin, 
Where the grass grows green. 
I 
love,. etc. 
'Tis true he has a 
weakness 
For a 
drop of something pure, 
But that's a 
slight debility 
That many more endure. 
He's fond of fun, he's witty— 
Though his wit ' tis not too keen, 
For, there's feeling hearts in Erin, 
Where the grass grows green. 
I 
love, etc. 
There's not a 
true-born Irishman, 
Wherever be may be, 
But loves the little Emerald 
That sparkles on the sea. 
May the sun of bright prosperity 
Shine peaceful and serene, 
And bring better days to Erin, 
Where the grass grows green. 
I 
love, etc. 
Fifteen Years Ago. 
Parody on " Twenty Years Ago." 
I've wandered through the village, and was singing 
merrily, 
When I 
was arrested and brought to jail tlat oft 
sheltered you and me; 
CAPTALN KELLY'S "SONGSTER. 
37 
But none was there to bail me out,at least they 
told me so, 
For I 
wasn't acquainted with the judge like fifteen 
years ago. 
The boys are at the game of stealing coffee and tea, 
They btole a 
ham the other night, you've done it oft 
with me. 
They're gambling still for money, Tom, at keno, 
you know, 
That dear old game we loved so well some fifteen 
years ago. 
And the jail is altered some, ' tis larger now than 
then, 
The cells they are much wider, Tom, to accommodate 
gentlemen ! 
But the bell is there that rang when to the Island 
we must go; 
The music's just as sweet, dear Tom, as fifteen years 
ago. 
The river is running just as still, the willows on its 
side, 
Fell on a 
man, dear Tom, and yesterday he died. 
The grapevine, too, is ruined, Tom, where we had 
fun, you know, 
In banging up poor Keiser's dog, some fifteen years 
ago. 
Down by the spring, close near the elm, you know, 
poor William Way, 
I 
mean the old shoemaker, Tom, I 
seen him yester-
day; 
Some heartless wretch has peeled his face, he's dy-
ing sure but slow, 
Just as the one whose nose you cut, died fifteen 
years ago. 
33 
CAPTIAN KELLY'S SONGSTER. 
My lips have long been dry, dear Tom, and tears 
come in my eyes 
When I 
think of the hash we used to have, and 
then those mutton pies. 
When I 
went in to get a 
drink, dear Tom, I 
started 
so, 
I 
was dead broke, I 
had no change, like fifteen years 
ago. 
Some are in the Tombs, dear Tom, a-singing " Ever 
of Thee," 
But few are left of those gentlemen, excepting you 
and me. 
But when the gong it sounds, dear Tom, and to 
dinner we must go, 
I 
hope they'll give us pork and beans, like fifteen 
years ago. 
Bentiful Neil. 
Ant.—" Beautiful Dells." 
Don't talk to me of pretty girls, 
Of lovely women, don't 
I'll never listen to a 
word,

To match my peerless Belle,

We met, ' twas in a

As some one somewhere sings 
The scene, a 
ball- room, where I 
marked 
This angel wanting wings. 
She floated in the gay quadrille, 
Mazurkaed, polked as well, 
But whirling wildly in the waltz 
The darling tripped and fell, 
SpotiEN.—Exposing the smallest portion of the 
heel of a 
Cinderella slipper, oh !— 
Beautiful girl, etc. 
I 
picked her up tenderly, 
And asked if she was hurt; 
Conveyed her to an ottoman, 
And then began to flirt. 
She told me she was but eighteen, 
Was reading Martin Tupper, 
Was fond of stpolls in moonlit groves, 
And thought she'd have some supper. 
Beautiful girl, etc. 
At supper, lobster salad, love, 
And chickens we discussed ; 
We gabbled and we gobbled, as 
All supping lovers must ; 
We champagned, sherried, and moselled, 
Each time the bottle past. 
Methought each smile the darling gave 
Was lovlier than the last. 
Beautiful girl, etc. 
I 
think, somehow, the wine I 
drank 
Had made me all amiss;

No Irish Need Apply. 
I'm a 
dacent boy, just landed from the town of Bal-
ly fad ; 
I 
want a 
situation, yis, I 
want it mighty bad, 
I 
saw a 
place advartized, it's the thing for me, 
says I. 
But the dirty spalpeen ended with, " No Irish need 
apply." 
Whop I 
says I, but that's an insult, though to get 
the place I'll try; 
So I 
wint to see the blaggar with, " No Irish need 
apply." 
I 
started off to find the house, I 
got it mighty 
soon, 
There I 
found the ould chap saited, he was reading 
the Tribune. 
I 
tould him what I 
came for, whin he in a 
rage did 
fly; 
•tr, 
CAPTAIN IZELLY'S SONGSTER. 
41 
No I 
says he, you are a 
Paddy, and no Irish need 
apply I 
Then I 
felt my dandher rising, and I'd like to black 
his eye— 
To tell an Irish gintleman, no Irish need apply. 
I 
couldn't stand it longer, so a 
hoult of him I 
took, 
And I 
gave him such a 
welting as he'd get at Don-
nybrook; 
He hollered nailla murther-I and to get away did 
try, 
And swore he'd never write again, No Irish need 
apply; 
He made a 
big apology, I 
bid him thin good-bye, 
Saying, whin next you want a 
bating add, no Irish 
need apply. 
Sure I've heard that in America it always is the 
plan, 
That an Irishman is just as good as any other 
man, 
A 
home and hospitality they never will deny 
The stranger here, or ever say, no Irish need ap-
ply. 
But some black sheep are in the flock, a 
dirty lot, 
say I; 
A 
dacint man will never write, no Irish need apply. 
Sure Paddy's heart is in his hand, as all the world 
does know, 
nis praties and his whiskey he will share with 
friend or foe; 
His door is always open to the stranger passing 
by; 
He never thinks of saying, none but Irish need ap-
ply; 
42 
CAPTAIN KELLY'S SONGSTER. 
And in Columbia's history, his name is ranking 
high, 
Thin, the divil take the knaves that write, no Irish

Ould Ireland on the battle- field a 
lasting fame has 
made, 
We all have heard of Meagher's men, and Carcor-
an's brigade, 
Though fools may flout, and bigots rave, and fan

Yet when they want good fighting m

Then the rebel ran

Answer to " No Irish Need Apply." 
They insult an Irishman, and think naught of what

They'll call him green, an Irish bull, it happens

If you'd corn

Pat would share his last potato with the destitute

If you were sick and weary and had no place to 
The berd

'u'd get, though poor perhaps, would be 
Pat's very best; 
He'd nurse you too, he would do that, and give 
you whiskey too, 
And you cannot find a 
nobler act than Irishmen 
can do. 
Did you ever know an Irishmen from any danger 
flinch ? 
In fighting too, he'd rather die than give his foe an 
inch ; 
Among the bravest in the world are the sons of 
Erin's green isle. 
Sure, the Iron Duke of Wellington was a 
native of 
the soil, 
And didn't he badly whip the French on the plains 
of Waterloo ? 
Which plainly showed to the whole world what 
Irishmen can do. .

to Ireland, they'd treat you well, I'm

Old Ireland's had her warriors, who fought both 
true and brave; 
Pat's assisted every nation, on the land and on the 
wave, 
And poets too, she's had, yes, many and many a 
score; 
Where can you find much brighter stars than Lover 
or Tom Moore ? 
Old Ireland's had her actors, and authors not a 
few ; 
And things of wit and humor the Irish Dal can do. 
44 
CAPTIAN KELLY'S SONGSTER. 
Did you ne'er hear tell of Sheridan or of lamented 
Catherine Hays ? 
Did you ne'er see fun in Irish songs or laugh at Irish 
plays ? 
Old Ireland's had her statesmen, their fame the wide 
world rings. 
She's likewise had musicians:to tune her old harp 
strings! 
Not all, Irish girls- are beautiful, but then they're 
always true, 
And for faith and generosity, the Irish girls will 
do. 
And- then too, in the present .war between the North 
and South, 
Let no dirty slur on Irish ever escape your mouth; 
Sure did you never hear tell of the 69th who bravely 
fought at Bull Run, 
And Meagher, of the seven days' fight that was in 
front of Richmond, 
With General Shields, who fought so brave for the

And anything like a 
bayonet-charge the Irish boys 
can do. 
Then why slur upon the Irish? Why are they 
treated- so ? 
What is it you have against them? is what I 
want 
to know; 
Sure they work for all they get; and that you can't 
deny! 
Then why insult thenrwith-

can do.

Kissing good- night to the birds in their nests 
Wake from they radiant dreams of delight, 
Fairest of gems on the brow of the night.

Sings of thy beauty in low melody; 
Roses and lilies are smiling in dreams, 
Softly is heard : he light step of the streams. 
Why art thou slumbering ? everything fair 
Revels, to- night, in the silvery air. 
Linger not, darling, I've something to tell,

Now I'll tell you if I 
can, of a 
pretty girl called 
Nan, 
Who stole the young affections of this individual. 
I 
never knew no love but I 
know it now, by Jove 1 
And I 
sorrow through the treatment of a 
false 
young gal! 
She was a 
perfect Venus, and had nothing came 
at ween us, 
:We might have been as happy as a 
great big tur-
tle dove. 
CHORUS. 
But a 
man named Jimmy Riddle, what played upon 
the fiddle, 
lie managed for to swindle me out of my true love. 
At a 
bakery in the street called Grand, you •w:11 
please to understand, 
I 
first beheld my Nancy, who behind the counter 
stood, 
She looked so neat and nice, while serving out her 
pies 
To the many hungry customers I 
the sight would 
do you good. 
I 
felt sad as I 
passed by, so I 
thought I'd buy a 
pie, 
And would gain a 
smile from Nancy, if not 
beneficial prove; 
But oh that Jimmy Riddle, the bloat that played 
the fiddle, 
I 
knew that be would swindle me of my true 
love. 
48. 
CAPTAIN KELLY'S SONGSTER, 
Now I 
told my love to Nan, like an honest good 
young man, 
She smiled, and looked at me and said that I 
was 
• very kind, 
And. if I 
would but stay till her twenty-first birth-
day, 
• 
She'd think the matter over and let me know her 
mind. 
The fiddler used to fawn so, I 
thought I'd done him 
brown, 
To gain a 
smile from Nancy—what happiness, by 
Jove I 
But oh that Jimmy Riddle, the beat that played 
the fiddle, 
He managed for to swindle me out of my true 
love. 
VOW her birthday drawing near, thinks I, I'll go and 
see her, 
t 
So, in I 
goes, quite full of hope, into her 
:little 
-• shop; 
But judge of my surprise! there was another blonde 
serving pies. 
My head began to spring around, and I 
thought 
that I 
would drop, 
Thinks I, I'll know the worst, although my heart 
would burst; 
I 
asked for Nan; the young woman my worst of 
fears did prove. 
SPOKEN.—Why, haven't you heard the news? 
No, says Il 
Why, we have got the laugh at you, 
and I 
discovered that— 
She'd married Jimmy Riddle, the fraud that played 
the fiddle, • 
He managed for to swindle me of my true.love. 
CAPTAIN KELLY'S SONGSTER. 
49 
Now I 
doesn't mean to fret, though I 
never yet 
have met 
A 
girl half like my Nancy, so loving, and so nice, 
And as to Jimmy Riddle, he, if my will should be, 
Compelled to live on nothing else but little penny 
pies, 
And if his days they were not short, they're better 
than I 
thought. 
So, farewell! darling Nancy, though faithless you 
did prove I 
Bad luck to Jimmy Riddle I 
I'd like to smash his 
fiddle; 
For he managed for to swindle me of my true 
love. 
Up in a Back Room. 
One day I 
got married, the truth I 
do state, 
When you have heard my sad tale, you will pity my 
fate; 
My wife makes me work both mori.ing and night, 
And she swears that I 
never do anything right. 
The first night I 
got married, it's the truth I am 
sure, 
My wife went to bed, and I 
lay on the floor 
But now that I'm married, I 
must do what I 
can, 
So pity the fate of a 
poor married man. 
CHORUS. 
Up in a 
back room, boys, up in a 
back room, 
All among the bugs and fleas; pity my sad doom, 
Up in a 
back room, boys, up in a 
backroom, 
I 
wish I 
never got married to be up in a 
back room. 
Every morning, it's true, to please her desire, 
She makeue get up, si,acl set light to the fire, 
72.9 
The breakfast. I 
make, and she has it, in bed, 
If I 
don't, why then pity ray poor head ! 
I've to wait till she's done, do you think that is fair ? 
If I 
say one word she will growl like a 
bear; 
I'm a 
tailor by trade, and my name it is Sam, 
And she says I'm but the ninth part of a 
man. 
Up in, etc. 
I 
sit on my shopboard a-stitching all day, 
While my wife goes out, dressed up so gay; 
Six months I've been married ; the truth I 
declare, 
But the joys of my wedlock, I 
have not yet shared. 
Before I 
got married, it's true on my word, 
She looked like an angel, and sung like a 
bird, 
But now like a 
lion she will fly very soon, 
II I 
say one word she will knock me down with the 
broom. 
Up in, etc. 
Last Sunday, it's true, now listen to me, 
She had the cheek to bring home a 
big soldier to 
tea; 
I 
said: Mrs. Brown, you k-now it's not right, 
Sae said, hold your tongue, Sammy, I 
shalt do as I 
like. 
They sat side by side, he gave her a 
kiss, 
I 
took up the tea pot, but him I 
did miss, 
He kicked me down stairs, and hurt my back bone, 
So I 
left them together to take tea alone. 
Up in, etc. 
I 
ran out of the house, I 
think I 
did right, 
She bolted the door, I 
was locked out all night, 
• 
Next morning I 
went home, of course, like a 
man, 
But I 
found that the soldier had bolted with Fan. 
Now they have gone away, I 
can whistle a 
tune; 
Perhaps they have cut their sticks up in a 
balloon, 
CAPTAIN KELLY'S SONGSTER. 
51 
But I 
don't wish to see her back any more, 
I 
can sleep on the bed instead of the floor. 
Up in a 
back room, boys, up in a 
back room, 
Now my wife has cut her stick, I 
can whistle a 
tune, 
Up in a 
back room, boys, I'll do the best I 
Can, 
I 
hope she'll like the soldier, my false, deceitful Fan. 
"Very Polite of Her. 
One night to a 
concert I 
went, 
I 
was dressed in my best from top to toe, 
Where many an evening I 
spent 
'Alongst the ladies, dear creatures, I 
love to go. 
I 
walked up the room in good style, 
There sot a 
sweet lass, I 
caught sight of her, 
She .
aid, take a 
chair, gave a 
smile, 
Now wasn't that very polite of her. 
CHOMITS. 
Foldi dol lol de di rol. 
As we at side by side on the chair, 
My heartstrings seemed to crack again; 
I 
threw sheep's eye at the dear, 
And she in return threw it back again. 
I 
called for a 
bottle of wine, 
Which very much gladdened the sight of her, 
She drank both her own share and mine, 
Now wasn't that very polite of her ? 
Foldi dol, etc. 
53 
CAPTIAN EELLYIS SONGSTER. 
Said I, Miss, take something to eat,, 
thought she would like a 
nice taste, so I 
Went into a 
shop down the street 
And bought half- a-dollar's worth of pastry, 
A 
puff- tart, or gooseberry pie, 
She said it was cfuite the delight of her; 
They were gone in the wink of your eye, 
Don't you think that was mighty polite of her, 
Foldi del,- etc. 
To drink negus I 
gained her consent, 
Forgetting my landloaliad called that day 
Till every dollar I 
spent. 
Good Lord, thinks I, there's-the rent to pay. 
I 
did not expect her abuse, 
Which you must all own wasn't right of her 
When she said, I 
am married, you goose, 
Now say, was that very polite of her ? 
Foldi dol, etc. 
With rage I 
began for to stamp, 
When a 
fellow came in and did bounce about, 
lie said if I•clid not decamp, 
My head he quickly would trounce about. 
He hit me a 
blow here about, 
Which knocked me flat down in the sight of her, 
She said, now he's down serve him out, 
Do you think that was very polite of her ? 
Foldi dol, eta. 
At length the policeviere called in, 
And over the room they did follow me, 
Without knowing the cause of the din, 
Two lanky blue divils did follow me: 
For assistance and mercy I 
prayed, 
CAPTAIN KELLY'S SONGSTER. 
She said I 
intruded in spite'of her; 
To the Tombs they had me conveyed, 
Now wasret that-mighty polite of her? 
Foldi dol, etc. 
Next morning the fine was ten dollar, 
To give this sweet damsel to quit her; 
No money nor friends could be found, 
So they'setit:me to jail as a 
rioter: 
My landlord a 
letter next sent, 
He- seized on my sticks everyinite of 'ern, 
As I 
owed him fifty dollars for rent, 
Now wasn't that very polite of him ? 
Foldi del, etc. 
63 
But at length I 
got free from jail 
Wherein I 
had shown my agility ; 
Folks says flook wonderful pale, 
But the picture of respectability. 
If ther&s any young lady divine, 
And my figure and form-please the sight of her, 
And she would consent to be mine, 
I 
shall take it as very polite of her.

I'm none of your Bulgrudderies, nor other shabby 
families, 
But can unto mv.pedigrees a 
pretty title show. 
Oh I 
I'm of the O's and Mac's, and likewise the 
sturdy whacks 
That live and toil in Ireland where the apple-
praties grow. 
I 
could a 
deal relate if I 
could but trace my pedi-
gree, 
My mother was a 
Hogan, but me father I 
don't 
know, 
I've ninety-nine relations in a 
place they call Ros-
carberry, 
And each unto their name has a 
Mac or an 0. 
My uncle was a 
Brallaghan, my aunt she was a 
Cal-
laghan, 
And as to my character, why, I 
can plainly 
show 
I'm a 
rantin' rovin' blade and I 
never was afraid, 
For I 
was born in Ireland where the apple-pra-
. ties grow. 
May Heaven still protect. our hospitable country, 
Where first I 
drew my living breath and heard 
its cocks to crow, 
Adieu to its green hills and its lovely bay of 
beauty, 
Where many a 
pleasant evening my love and I 
did go, 
Where shoals of fish so pleasantly did sport about 
so merrily, 
Beneath its glossy surface,: their wanton tricks 
to show; 
Oh those scenes I 
did enjoy, like a 
gay unthinking 
boy, 
With the lads who live in Ireland where the ap-
ple-praties grow. 
St. Patrick was our saint, and a 
blessed man in 
truth was he. 
Great gifts unto our country he freely did bestow, 
lie banished all the frogs and toads that sheltered 
in our country, 
And unto other regions it's they were forced to 
go. 
There is one fact undoubtedly that cannot contra-
' 
dieted be, 
For trace the Irish history and it will plainly 
show, 
Search the universe all round, tighter fellows can't 
be found 
Than the lhds who live in Ireland where the ap-
ple-praties grow, 
Than the lads who live in Ireland where the apple-
praties grow.

At your fingers ends ? then listen to my ditty.

She squints with both her -eyes jn a 
manner very 
shocking, 
She's got a 
mouth for pies, and wears no shoes or 
stockings. 
I'm afraid she's gone astray, and some chap did en-
list her, 
I'm afraid she's gone for good, say, have you seen 
my sister ? 
She wants her two front teeth, you'd see it when 
- 
she'd titter, 
She's got such little feet, Victoria's shoes wont fit 
her; 
She wears no cap at all, but a 
great big muslin 
w 
hister, 
Now tell me once for all, have you seen my sister ? 
Her figure's straight and tall, her conduct very pro-
per; 
She's well provided for, she's eighteen pence in cop-
per. 
Now if you have her seen, you never could forget 
her, 
For she's very much like me, now have you seen 
my sister ? 
Her mouth is very small, her nose is straight and 
notty, 
I 
tell you once for all, this girl is very pretty. 
Now I'll sing you another song and it shall be a 
twister, 
If you will go with me, and help me find my sister.

Riding on a Steamboat. 
Oh riding on a 
steamboat is just the thing for me, 
At least upon the river, and not upon the sea;

CAPTAIN KELLY'S SONGSTER.. 
All up the lovely Hudson or down the rippling bay, 
Oh I 
that's how I 
advise you to spend a 
happyday. 
CHORUS. 
Now then gentlemen, there's the bell again, 
Look alive my swell tip-toppers, steam is up and 
we must go. 
Now then, gentlemen, there's the bell again; 
Riding on a 
steamboat is so nice, you know 
Of all that leaves the harbor, I 
love the Bristol 
line, 
For there's a 
band of music, a-playing so divine: 
And as they're tootie-toqilis 3
-14(j. gag, klina 
Or promenade the deck with the lov'd one by your 
side. 
Now then, etc. 
And then there are the state-rooms, just seven feet 
by four, 
But why they are called state-rooms it puzzles me 
full sore; 
They're just as comfortable as are the sleeping cars, 
So follow my example, and stay up with the stars. 
Now then, etc.
