HH: Ok, if you wouldn’t mind just saying you full name for the recorder. I’m Hannah Harvester, with 
TAUNY. 
DA: I’m Diane Andrews. 
BA: Bob Andrews. 
HH: Okay, great. And we’re here in your home at Andrews View Farm in Fowler. And it’s January 7th, 
2013. Just to start out, did you both grow up in here in the area? 
DA: I’m from Minnesota.  
HH: Oh you are, okay. 
BA: I was born right here. I’m fourth generation.  
HH: Could you tell me a little about the history of this farm?  
BA: Well, our operation’s located in the town of Fowler. The town of Fowler is one of the most mineral 
rich areas in the State of New York, and we literally farm it in between the rocks. When the glacier 
activity took place it dropped large rock deposits of granite and minerals and sheets, and wherever 
there’s a ridge, there’s solid stone. And then between those ridges is tillable soil. And that’s the way we 
farm it, in between the rocks.  
HH: 01:33 Was it your grandfather and your father who started the farm? 
BA: My great-grandfather 
HH: Oh your great-grandfather. 
BA: My grandfather moved here in 1931 and we’ve been on this farm ever since. In fact, the room 
behind the refrigerator used to be a bedroom and my great-grandfather died in that room in 1935 from 
pneumonia.  
HH: Wow. 
BA: Yup. 
2 
 
HH: And your great-grandfather, did he immigrate here? 
BA: Yup, he came from England in 1882, into Canada and ended up down in this area. He started out 
working in the paper mills and ended up on a farm.  
(2:15) HH: Now did it start out as a dairy? 
BA: To my knowledge, it’s always been a dairy and wood.  
HH: And that’s still the case? You do logging or [end of track]

HH: Again, my name is Hannah Harvester, I’m with TAUNY, Traditional Arts in Upstate New York, it’s 
January 7, 2013, and I’m here with Bob and Diane Andrews in Fowler. Would you mind just briefly 
describing the history of the farm again; you said your great grandfather came over from-- 
 BA: My great-grandfather and grandfather moved in this farm in 1931. And we’ve been on this farm for 
81 years, going on 82 years right now, my family has. The land is part of old St. Lawrence Lake, lake of St. 
Lawrence. And it’s a lake bottom farm, meaning it’s a heavy clay farm. It’s a mineral rich farm and we 
literally farm it in between the stone ridges. The rock ridges. Our soils are fertile but they need constant 
water management because they can be excessively wet. The town of Fowler is famous for its zinc and 
its talc and used to be famous for the number of farms we had in the area but we’re dwindling in 
number right now.  
(0:01:20) 
HH: You were talking about how you finally came into farming and that you graduated with an 
associate’s degree and were working in the hardware store. Can you pick it up from there? 
BA: I realized I had an itchy foot. I wanted to see something different so I joined the Navy and I became 
a hospital corpsman in the Unites States Navy. They sent me down to Orlando, Florida for boot camp, 
then they sent me to Class A school in San Diego, California. My first duty station was Charleston, South 
Carolina where I was stationed on the cancer wards. And I worked that for 19 months. Most of the 
patients we had on the cancer wards were Air Force personnel and Navy personnel that were exposed 
to Agent Orange from Vietnam in 1972-3. That’s where I learned to appreciate the quality of life and 
what quality of life was. I had the misfortune of being assigned to a place where I watched a lot of men 
my own age, 18-22, die hard deaths. There was not a lot we could do for cancer in 1973 and 1974. But 
anyways, that’s why I try to stay as positive as I can in my daily routine. I do appreciate the fact of the 
quality of life that we do have here. After I was stationed at Charleston, I was fortunate enough to be 
picked up to go to Class C School which was preventative medicine school in Oakland, California. Back 
then it was considered environmental health and the very first course I took there was Dairy Food 
3 
 
Science. I was fortunate enough to graduate that course, was certified with the US Public Health service 
and had a US Public Health number. I also was allowed to go to some of the initial trainings for OSHA, 
Occupational Safety and Health programming. And we done that down in Alameda. After I completed 
that training course they sent me to Sasebo, Japan, where I replaced three preventative medicine 
personnel. I had my own department and that is where I met my wife, in Sasebo, Japan. We were there 
for two years and in 1978, June- oh no, in 1977, July I came home for a leave and Diane and I got 
married. Then I went back to Japan and Diane stayed in Albert Lea, Minnesota for what, 10 months? 
Something like that. But anyways I came out of the service the 23rd day of June 1978, came home to the 
farm. And Diane and I have been here ever since.  
(0:04:40)  
HH: So when you came back to the farm was your father still working here? 
BA: Yep, dad and I were in partnership. We put on 120’ addition on to the barn, built a new silo and 
when I came home in June, the foundation on the barn and the silo were set there. That’s what we 
done. Dad had 47 milkers at the time. There’d been a bunch of heifers that were going to freshen. We 
worked our way up to 87 cows and 70-some replacements and until just recently we pretty much 
maintained those numbers. 
HH: When you say replacements… 
BA: That’s calves and heifers that were coming into the line.  
(0:05:40) 
HH: OKay. You said something about the appreciation for the quality of life, was that one of the things 
that led you to come back into farming? 
BA: In Japan, I learned to appreciate the land, and not a very high population base. In Japan, the land is 
measured in what they call a tsubo.  A tsubo is one meter wide and 2 meters long, you know a meter is 
like 39”. And that’s the way that they sell and measure land. And that’s a lot different from what we do 
here in the United States. The land utilization in southern Japan and Sasebo was 100%. You see fruit 
trees on the side of the road, you see not only rice, but all sorts of vegetables on lands that, you know, 
were completely utilized. It’s a lot different from what it is in Northern New York. Right now we’re 
starting to see some land reclamation projects to bring acres back into production that had been lost 
and we’re seeing a higher rate of land utilization here in North New York today, but it’s taken us over 30 
years to get there, compared to what I saw. So that’s why I appreciate the quality of life, and that’s why I 
appreciate the land so much.  
(0:07:15)  
HH: When you were growing up and your dad was the main farmer and you had in that range of 40 
milkers, was that typical for this area? 
4 
 
BA: Oh yes. Back when I was a kid growing up, 70 cows was a big dairy. Today it’s a small dairy.  
HH: When you were growing up were there other workers on the farm or was it just the family? 
BA: Just family. 
(0:07:48) 
HH: So your mom also, and the kids, basically. Maybe this question is too large, but let me try it. What 
are the main tasks of dairy farming, how would you break it down? Is that too much? 
BA: Dairy farming #1. The only way you get paid is if you make milk, okay? The magic word with milk is 
lactation. That means that your animal has to be bred. If she doesn’t have a calf in her and she’s not 
milking, she’s not gonna make you any money. So the key components to dairy farming is taking care of 
your cattle, making sure they’re healthy, making sure they’re getting bred and making a high quality 
product for sale; and to manage it so you can make about the same quantity of milk every month so you 
can get a paycheck every month. And in order to do that, you’ve got to be able to feed them. So you’ve 
got to put up enough forage to feed them. Then you’ve gotta house them for the winter time, so that’s 
means you’ve got to maintain your buildings. You’ve got to have a line of machinery in order to harvest 
the crops to feed them.  
(0:09:30) 
 HH: So on your farm you have all the cropland that you use to grow their feed, or are you buying feed? 
BA: We have bought a little feed in the past, but the only things we’re buying right now are 
concentrates, and that’s grain. Grain and minerals. 
HH: And do they graze in the warmer months? 
BA: Oh yes. We maintain pasture. 
(0:10:00)  
HH: I think of dairy farming as a very seasonal job, what you have to do is vastly different season to 
season, right? Has the nature of what you need to do month to month changed at all since you were 
growing up? 
BA: In the spring you plant and then you start to harvest. You harvest all summer long.  And then 
whatever you plant in the spring, your corn and sorghums, you harvest them in the fall, your perennial 
plants. And then hopefully with your hays and clovers you get two or three cuttings of that per season. 
So that continues. You maintain your buildings, you maintain your machinery. It’s a cycle, it just 
continues and continues.  
(0:11:00)  
HH: You started working here with your dad in 1978? 
5 
 
BA: That’s when we came home to the farm, yeah.  
HH: Have you had to have any hired hands over the years? What has been your labor situation in the 
time that you’ve been back on the farm? 
BA: We’ve had hired help, when our numbers were higher. In fact we had one hired man for over nine 
years. But with workman’s compensation and the expenses that were associated with hired help, and 
then everything else, we got to the point where we’ve cut back to the point where it’s just Diane and I, 
we don’t have any hired help right now. And of course the kids did help while they were at home 
growing up. 
(0:12:07)  
HH: And how many children do you have? 
BA: We have three daughters.  
HH: And they’re all grown up? 
BA: We’re very proud of our daughters. Our oldest daughter Jessie, she graduated from Potsdam State, 
she has two Master’s Degrees, one in Special Education and one in Art Therapy. She’s a school teacher 
down in Syracuse. My son-in-law Shannon is a librarian at Syracuse University, doing real well. And then 
my middle daughter Melissa, she’s a librarian down in Boston. In fact we’re going to have a wedding 
here in the farm on the 24th of August for her and my future son-in-law, Richard. That’s going to be here 
at the farm. And my youngest daughter Bobby Jean just graduated with a degree in - 
DA:  Art Design 
BA: -Art Design from her college. In fact we flew down to Albany for her graduation last June. And that’s 
a bachelor’s Degree. She’s in Glens Falls right now. So we’ve got three daughters. 
DA: Fort Ann 
BA: Fort Ann. Which ain’t too far from Glens Falls.  
(0:13:20)  
HH: Were any of them involved in 4H and things like that when they were- 
DA: 4H. 
(0:13:36)  
HH: I’m interested in whether there’s a division of labor by gender. What did your mother do? Did she 
work full time on the farm or did she have outside work? 
BA: She worked on the farm and she had outside work too. She worked for the school district in the 
cafeteria for a while. And then she worked at- 
6 
 
DA: Big M 
BA: -Big M in Gouverneur as a cashier for a number of years.  
(0:14:13)  
HH: And you were a full-time school nurse for many years- 
DA: No, just part-time. 
HH: Part-time. Okay, so you were always part-time and then working on the farm? 
DA: I started actually at the school before I started down at the barn.  
HH: And what are your main jobs on the farm? 
DA: I milk all the cows.  
HH: Okay. And what is your milking system? 
DA: Pipeline. 
BA: Pipeline milkers.  
HH: And you always work part-time. How important was that income to the overall economy of the 
farm? 
BA: Very. In fact, I did the agricultural survey last time. The USDA agricultural survey. And I figured that 
our farm this last year only made a 20% contribution to our living. 
HH: Wow. 
BA: And that was one of the major questions on the survey last time. And that’s what I mathed out, 20%. 
So her income from the school has been very beneficial to us over the years. Especially in the last four or 
five years. That’s been our disposable income. 
(0:15:44)  
HH: You said that fairly recently you’ve cut the number of animals that you have. When did that happen 
and what led to that decision?  
BA: What led to it? Age. Our age. 
DA: (garbled) …not getting the cows bred. 
BA: Yup, that was another one. We had breeding problems. Our goal is to increase efficiency and cut 
down on numbers. And I’m hoping that’s going to pay off. 
(0:16:23) 
7 
 
HH: And so what are your plans for increasing efficiency? 
BA: Just paying more attention to what I have. By cutting down on numbers that will give me more feed 
for the rest of them. So I can increase their intake a little bit. I’m hoping that eventually I can do 
something with the genomics, which is DNA testing. We’ve got such an extensive history of breeding 
here that I think that once we do some DNA genomic testing that it’s going to increase the value of my 
cattle. So I’m hoping to do some of that in the near future. 
HH: You’re going to use that information to make decisions about breeding? And increase their- 
BA: Increase their dollar value, so if we decide to sell, they’ll be more valuable. 
(0:17:20) 
HH: And I’m sorry, can you explain again what makes it a registered dairy? 
BA: Prodigy (sic). Keeping track of the fathers, meaning sires. And the mothers, meaning dams. And their 
genetic compositions.  
HH: Do you know how common it is to have a dairy where 100% of the cattle are registered? 
BA: Registered dairies. A lot of farmers when money got tight they stopped maintaining their records. So 
they’ve lost their registrations. I do believe there is a less registered animals than there was 10 years 
ago. But there are people who are starting to relook at it. Good cows always have good value. And if 
you’ve got the records behind them, both genetic and production it makes the cows more valuable.  And 
that’s where the money comes from, the value of the animal. Not only in their production but in their 
genetic characteristics. 
(0:19:02) 
HH: Your farm is relatively small for not only the area, but for the United States. How did you come to 
that decision to keep it small and how have you made it work economically? 
BA: Thirty-four years ago we were not small. But with the evolution of the growth and the 
disappearance of the small farms, we are a small farm today. I’ve never really had an interest in doing 
anything else on a full-time basis. I’ve many opportunities to do something else, but I haven’t. I am an 
assessor for the town of Fowler, but there again, that goes right along with the farm because land is 
everything.  
(0:21:19) HH: When you say you’ve opportunities do you mean outside of farming itself or changing 
your way of farming? 
BA: I’ve had opportunities made available to me in the past do to things that were related to agriculture.  
HH: So what is it that keeps you in farming? 
8 
 
BA: I like it here. I don’t like to get up in the morning and have to drive somewhere to go to work. I like 
the feeling of growing a crop, a good crop. I like the end of the day and you look over your shoulder and 
you feel that you can see that you’ve accomplished something. I like that a lot. The only person I work 
for is sitting right next to me, Diane, I like that too, most of the time. I really, I guess, I’m more tolerant 
than Diane is, but I only tolerate so much from other people. Do you know what I- 
(0:21:28) 
 HH: How would you describe your relationship to your animals? 
BA: It’s what I make my living off of. Whatever I’ve got, whatever we’ve got down in that barn is the 
accumulation of breeding that started in 1964. So it used to bother me terrible to lose an animal. Have 
one fall down break a leg or destroy one. But after all of these years, the reality is, if misfortune falls on 
them and they get sick and can’t be helped, the only thing is to destroy them and move on. I hated to 
see people die when I was working in the hospital and I hated to see my animals go down. It bothered 
me a lot for a while, but I’ve got over that. We eat our own meat, our misfortunes. If we have an animal 
break its leg or so forth, we’ll try to salvage whatever we can. I know sometimes it ain’t the best chewing 
meat or the best hamburger, but we try to salvage as much as we can. We eat our misfortunes. 
(0:22:50) 
HH: What about you Diane, how would you describe your relationship to the cows- 
(women laughing) 
HH: -as the milker? 
DA: No comment. 
HH: You milk how many times a day? 
DA: Twice.  
HH: And how long does it take? 
DA: About two hours; an hour and a half to two hours. 
HH: Okay. The schedule works out that you can work part-time and be responsible for the milking? What 
times are the milkings? 
DA: 5:30 in the morning and maybe 3:30 in the afternoon. 
(0:23:30) 
HH: What is the system for getting your milk to market? Who does it go to? 
9 
 
BA: We were associated with Marvel City Bulk through 1988 and then we switched over as an 
independent producer and shipped to Crowley Foods from 1988-2011. Twenty-three years. From 2011-
today we’re shipping to Agri-Mark.  
HH: Okay. 
DA: Yup. 
BA: We were independent for twenty-three years, meaning that we didn’t belong to a co-op, we just 
had a signed contract. It got to the point where we were being shuffled around like we were a card in a 
deck. Expenses kept going up, such as hauling- 
DA: They were adding market fees and fuel charges and nickel and diming you to death. 
BA: So we made the move to Agri-Mark. 
HH: And has that been working out so far? 
BA: There are only two milk buyers in the area. You’ve got the Dairy Farmers of America, a direct 
marketing service. That’s all part of the same Dairylea umbrella. Then you’ve got Agri-Mark. Those are 
the two players that are left in the milking industry in Northern New York. And we’ve decided to go with 
Agri-Mark, which is still a cooperative-based milk handler. Agri-Mark owns its own milk plants. 
(0:25:24) 
HH: I’m curious; who do you see as your customers? Do you see the people who are consuming your 
milk or the buyer as your customer? Does that make sense? 
BA: We have an opportunity twice a year to buy some of our own product back for cheese and butter 
and stuff like that. And we’ve taken an opportunity to do that. And we give cheese and butter away for 
Christmas presents. And I’m telling you, I really believe people appreciate those kinds of gifts. In fact 
that black wax cheddar cheese is classified as one of the best cheeses in the world. We bought a whole 
case of that as used it as Christmas presents this year.  
HH: You do that through Agri-Mark? 
BA: Yeah. And then we buy butter and I really think our butter is good. And this coming spring we’re 
going to have yogurt available for us to purchase. 
(0:26:40) 
HH: For both of you, what is the most challenging aspect of dairy farming? 
BA: Right now today? 
HH: Sure. 
10 
 
BA: Trying to pay your bills. Expenses have gone way, way, way out of line. It’s like a balance beam. You 
sell so much milk, you make so much money. And you’ve got your expenses in order to produce that 
milk. We do a good job, we try to do a good job. I try to control my expenses. She’s a lot more 
conservative than I am at spending and so forth. But the expenses are eating us alive. And the milk value 
is not staying in line. And it bothers the hell right out of me because we’re in a milk deficit area. We have 
more demand for milk than we can produce. We can’t produce enough milk to meet the demands of 
these plants that we have right now. And yet our milk prices are depressed. And there’s no—when you 
and I were kids growing up, you took an economics course and they talked about supply and demand, 
and they talk about guns and butter… There’s no relativity to that whatsoever in this day and age. It’s all 
market manipulation and we’re being taken advantage of. That’s the biggest downfall to the dairy 
industry. There’s no true value to your market. What can you do? It’s fixed by the federal government 
what your price is going to be.  
(0:28:43) 
HH: What’s the most enjoyable or satisfying aspect of dairy farming for you? 
BA: For me? It’s that new calf, it’s a good crop, it’s when you have events where people come around 
appreciate what they see and say it looks nice; it’s going out in the field and watching the wildlife while 
you’re working. Some days I don’t talk to people; I don’t see anybody to talk to but I have deer running 
around me, I’ll have partridge running around me, I’ll have turkeys running around me. Maybe a coydog. 
I like that a lot. I like it when I go out in the woods. I even like it when I’m fixing fence. When everything 
is going smooth, I like it when fencing is coming on. I like the feel of plowing, of working ground and 
feeling the temperature of soil in your hand. I like the looks of that corn coming through the ground. I 
like it when the little oaties are starting to stick their heads up out of the ground. I like all of that. I like it 
when the baby turkeys line up in a row and start chasing grasshoppers; that’s fun to watch. They’re like 
little roadrunners, running around chasing. I like watching that. Have you ever seen a fawn being born? 
HH: No. 
BA: I’ve seen that several times. 
HH: Wow. 
BA: I like that sort of stuff. I like going down here on the edge of the swamp and watching the otters 
play. I like watching the ducks and the geese. I like growing my giant pumpkins! 
(laughter) 
HH: How giant? 
BA: Well this is our first year- 
(end of second track lost-pumpkin was 400 lbs) 
Track 3 
11 
 
Track 3 
HH: Wow. Very Good. 
BA: Yeah. I thought so! For our first time out. 
(0:00:10)  
HH: You talked about feeling the temperature of the soil.  It sounds to my mind that you need so many 
different kinds of knowledge to be a successful farmer. Can you describe what the knowledge and skills 
you need to be a successful dairy farmer? So you need to know all this information about your cattle. 
DA: (to Bob) You know—you need to know soil temperatures, when to plant your corn. She’s talking 
about that kind of stuff, you know. 
BA: This farm, right here, is a low wet heavy clay farm.  We’re a lot different than the large majority of 
soils in St. Lawrence and Jefferson and Lewis County, because we are low. I’ve had the opportunity to be 
involved in a program called, ‘North Country Ag Development.’ This is a program that Cornell started in 
1962 where they take seed and they plant it and see if it’s compatible to your geographic area and the 
information that’s compounded from that over the years has developed a lot of seeds that fit for 
Northern NY;  they’re climatically compatible. Short season corn used to be corn would be 100 growing 
degree days. Now you can buy it at low as 62 growing degree days. That means you’ll put it in the 
ground and with enough heat and so forth, you can put it in the ground the first of June and harvest it 
by the 30th of August, fully mature and dry, ready to go into the silo or the bunker.  Soybeans, 25 years 
ago you couldn’t find very many acres of soybeans.  We’re seeing soybeans being grown all over the 
area because of development being done on seed varieties that are compatible for this area. So number 
1, you’ve got to plant the right seeds for the soil type that you have in the area.  That’s important.  The 
same with your selection of grasses that you’re going to feed to your cows. When you put new seedlings 
down, you want to make sure you’re gonna invest in a seed type that’s gonna stay in your ground and 
give you enough productivity to justify all the work of putting it into the ground.  That’s one aspect of it. 
I talked about the genomics, or the genetics, of the cows. Every time you breed them you want to make 
them a little superior. We used to do a breed cow mating program where we would take a look at each 
individual cow, look at her size and stature, her teet placement, the strength of udders and so forth, her 
body depth, her leg components and so forth and try to select a bull that would address her deficiencies. 
And we done that for a number of years. I was a big believer in young sire technology, where new bulls 
were coming in, where we would breed young sires hoping to increase our genetic pool by three years 
by doing it. Yeah, that was one thing. What else can I talk about? Getting the feed and putting it up in a 
manner that’s gonna maximize it as far as digestibility, and to make the animals healthy and productive.  
Does that answer your question? 
(0:04:20)  
HH: Yeah. How do you put your feed up here? Do you use the silos? 
12 
 
BA: Yup. We have three types of harvesting systems. We have three silos that we operate, which is 
chopped silage. We have a dry baler, so we put up dry hay. And then I have a round bailer where I can 
put up dry hay and also silage bales and rounds, and then wrap ‘em in plastic.  
(0:04:50)  
HH: Would you say that the knowledge that you use day-to-day, how much would you say is what you 
learned growing up from your parents and 4H, and how much is new, these new advances and new 
knowledge? Or is it all… 
BA: Well I do read the trade magazines, some more than others. This new tall fescue, for example. I was 
a little hesitant to plan on that, but the tremendous tonnage that I’m getting off from it is really 
something that I’m impressed with. I don’t know how to answer you. 
HH: Well it sounds like maybe you got the foundation and now you’re continuing to expand your 
knowledge. It sounds like some trial and error as well? 
BA: One of the biggest conflicts I ever had with my dad was, my dad was a work horse, ok?  And he was 
literally like a horse that has blinders on and it was all straight forward to him. And there’s nothing 
wrong with that, but I’ve always tried to be a little more broad spectrum in my thinking. That’s why I’ve 
been involved in Soil and Water District and why I’ve been involved with the Farmland Protection Board. 
That’s why I’ve been involved with the North Country Ag Development, it’s trying to keep myself a little 
broad spectrum to some of the things that are going on. I do, I use that information. It does affect me; it 
does influence my decision-making in some aspects. Right now we’re seeing the biggest change that 
we’ve ever seen in St. Lawrence County as far as land usage. We’re seeing a lot more corn being 
planted. Grain values are extremely high, we’re seeing more soybeans being planted, record numbers, 
we’re seeing lands that had been forgotten, fallow lands that are being brought back into production. 
We’re seeing drainage projects and hedge row removals to the magnitude that ten years ago was 
absolutely unfathomable. But it’s all happening here in St. Lawrence County. We’re seeing land demand 
that we’d never seen before. There’s 29 Amish families worrying about moving into the Gouverneur 
area right now and a local lawyer just closed on five properties before the end of the year, all to Amish 
right here in the Gouverneur area. So land values are changing, land demand is changing and not to 
mention the fact that the Army from Fort Drum has this Army Compatible Buffer Program that’s already 
been made available in Antwerp, NY and we’re right next door to Antwerp. But not there’re 
concentrating down in the Copenhagen, Denmark area because they’re talking about putting up 
windmills and windmills are gonna be detrimental to their robotic airplanes. They’re concentrating on 
that area right now. So yeah, we’re seeing a lot of changes. A lot more changes in the future.

HH: Where do you see dairy farming in the North Country, or maybe in St. Lawrence County? What 
direction do you see it heading? 
13 
 
BA: There’s always gonna be farming, dairy farming in St. Lawrence County. There’s no doubt in my 
mind. Unfortunately, I believe it’s all gonna be big farms in the very near future. And with the economic 
pressures put on small farms, there’s just no future for a small farm to make its own way and provide a 
living for a family right now and into the future. Expenses are way greater than the value of milk and 
with an imbalance like that you ain’t got a snowball’s chance in hell. 
HH: Yeah.

Track 4 
[left off recording: Did you know that dairy farmers are the greatest stewards of land and water in New 
York State?] 
BA: …And that’s a true statement. The greatest stewards of land and water in New York State and yet 
we have the most regulatory industry that there is.  
(0:00:15)  
HH: What is your manure system? 
BA: We have a solid manure system and we have three storage pads so we don’t have to spread in the 
winter. We don’t spread on snow, as a general rule. 
HH: Is that…to have a solid manure system, is that not very common? Because you’re the first person 
I’ve asked that has a solid manure system. Is it because you’re still fairly small that you’re able to do 
that? 
BA: Number one, there’re a lot of merits to liquid manure, but with our soil types and our topography, I 
felt that liquid manure didn’t fit with this operation. So we take the manure out and we spread it on the 
land when we can, and when we can’t we put it into the storage pads. And then we move it in the 
spring, which gives us a little higher value from the manure. Our wastewater that comes out of the milk 
house, we installed a wood bed filter system a number of years ago so that the water that comes out of 
my milk house goes into woodchips which provide the medium for bacteria breakdown on that water 
coming out of the milk house. In fact, at one time we were the furthest most woodchip filter system in 
the continental United States, back when it was first installed.  
HH: Uhuh. Very good. 
BA: But I carry the Soil and Water District so it means I work with the USDA and we have a very good 
relationship with that program and I know what’s going on. 
(0:02:24)  
HH: Now I’d like to, if you don’t mind, just say a little more about, you said that New York State dairy 
farmers were the greatest stewards of land and water in the state. Can you say a little more about that? 
14 
 
BA: It would be just like shooting yourself in the foot if you didn’t take care of the water and the land, 
because we are the largest property owners, as a general rule. We pay the most property taxes, we own 
the most property to maintain our businesses and so forth. People are very conscious about maintaining 
quality water, whenever you talk about water quality no matter where you are people stop and listen. 
And that’s a true statement. Look at what we’re seeing over here to Black Lake. Look at what we’re 
seeing with the water system developments that they’re putting in for sewage and water supplies 
around these communities and so forth. Water quality is a big deal and part of being a farmer is being a 
good steward, and we are. We do a real good job of maintaining water quality and land quality. There’s 
virtually, virtually zero—well, I can’t say zero—but soil erosion in this area is extremely low. And with 
the new technologies that are in place like no till planting and so forth, soil erosion is becoming less and 
less of a problem all the time with more tillable acres, which is good. 
(0:04:06)  
HH: Well, I’m nervous about the battery on this and I’m just wondering if either of you would like to say 
anything more about your farm that I didn’t ask about, that’s important to you. 
BA: The biggest reason I wanted to do this with you, I wanted to have something documented for my 
grandchildren. We have three grandchildren right now: six, three and one and I thought it would be nice 
if they had some idea what their grandpa and grandma done. I’m very happy with our home, I’m very 
happy with what Diane and I have accomplished in our lives here and I’m very proud of my children. I 
guess I just want them to know that.  
HH: Okay, well thank you.
