The Girl I Left Behind Me
THE GIRL I LEFT BEHIND ME 5136 A1
Frank Pipkin Arvin, 1941
There is a wealthy merchant Which lives on a hill close by He had a lovely daughter On
whom I cast my eye. Her being so tall and handsome So lovely and so fair There was not
another girl With which I could compare.
I asked her if she'd be willin' For me to cross the plains She said she'd be willin' If I'd return
again She said that she'd be true to me Till death proved her unkind So I shook her hand
and parted From the girl I left behind.
I left Okup County For Denver I was bound I roamed to Denver City And viewed the town
all around. Work and money being plenty The girls to me was kind - But the only object on
my mind Was the girl I left behind.
