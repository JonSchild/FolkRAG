[Kim Shuck reads “This River”] 
 
Kim Shuck:  This poem was about the fact that I’m an immigrant Indian in California. My people 
are originally from actually very northern Georgia. We’re Aniyunwiya, called Cherokee now. My 
family, my father moved here from northeastern Oklahoma at the end of the 50s to be in the 
Navy. It’s a reference to the fact that I’m a guest here and I totally appreciate and know that 
that’s true. Thank you.
