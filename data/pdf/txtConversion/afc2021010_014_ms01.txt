Interview with Brian Grim – 2/20/2022

Brian Grim (b. 1970, Konnarock, Virginia) is a rural mail carrier in Fries, Virginia and lives in Elk Creek, 
Virginia. He has been carrying the mail since 1994 and was initially interested in the job in part because 
he knew other old-time musicians, like Wayne Henderson and Gerald Anderson, who carried the mail. 
Brian is an old-time fiddler and played in the band the Konnarock Critters with his sister Debby Grim 
Yates. He is also a sheep shearer and farmer.  
I learned of Brian through the former Virginia state folklorist Jon Lohman. We conducted the interview in 
Wayne Henderson’s guitar shop, after I’d interviewed Wayne, and then Brian, Wayne, and Redd Volkaert 
played some tunes in Wayne’s kitchen (see video and audio).

BG: Brian Grim 
EH: Emily Hilliard 
 
00:00 
EH: It is February 20, 2022, and I'm in Rugby, Virginia. Why don't you introduce yourself and tell me 
your name, the year you were born and where you're from?  
 
BG: My name is Brian Grim. I was born in 1970 and I live in a little community called Elk Creek, 
Virginia but I carry the mail over in Fries, Virginia. Fries is spelled F-R-I-E-S. There's always a joke 
about it being "freeze" in the winter and "fries" in the summer, but (laughs). I've been--I was a substitute 
mail carrier there for about 12 years before I got the route. So I carry Route 1 Fries now and it's, when I 
first started out, you know as a kid the mail carrier that came by my house in Konnarock, Virginia, Olaf 
Richardson, I thought he had the best job around and everything and I got to thinking, I might like to be a 
mailman one day. And then things happened to where I was trying to do some farming and carpentry 
work and that sort of thing and the opportunity came up to apply with the Postal Service and be a 
substitute mail carrier and that's how I got started!  
 
EH: Did knowing Wayne [Henderson] influence that at all? 
 
BG: Yeah, I know Wayne when he was carrying the mail and that was another thing. Gerald Anderson, he 
was a mailman and to think all these guys play old-time music and I play old-time music and maybe I 
should be a mailman too! (laughs) 
 
EH: And Buddy Pendleton.  
 
BG: Yeah.  
 
EH: Did you know him? 
 
BG: I knew who he was, but. 
 
EH: Yeah. Doesn't he have a mail-themed record? 
 
BG: I'm not sure. 
 
EH: Maybe that was just a joke, but I think Jon Lohman [the former Virginia State Folklorist] was saying 
"Buddy Pendleton Delivers," as maybe an album name or fake album name or something. 
 
BG: (laughs)  
 
EH: So tell me how you first learned the job and what that was like? 
 
BG: Well when I first learned the job, it was, of course I went for an interview with the postmaster that 
was there and he said, “Well we may be calling you when we need some help.” And it wasn't like 2 days 
later, he said, can you come in? We're in need of somebody to help out! So I went in and I started training 
on the route. It was real quick as soon as I took an interest in that office and they got me started pretty 
quick. Fortunately I didn't have to do any training around Christmas time. If I had I probably wouldn't 
have made it. Because Christmas time for a mailman is BRUTAL (laughs). 
 
EH: I bet. Yeah, what was it like to learn and how did you learn?

BG: Well, when I learned everything just came in raw. It came in in tubs. Nothing was sorted out so it 
was all just tubs of letters and tubs of magazines and newspapers and there wasn't anything really in any 
particular order so you had to learn from the top of the case to the bottom of the case and it was, 
nowadays we get DPS mail which is, it's all sequenced out in a tray. So it all the letter mail comes in 
order. So it makes it a whole lot easier when you're learning because you start up at the top of the route 
and just follow the mail around and follow your pigeonholes around and that makes it a lot easier learning 
than the way I had to learn.  
 
EH: So walk me through a typical day of when you get to the post office to when you get back home. 
 
BG: Typical day at the post office. Well I go in around 7:30 in the morning and the clerk and the 
postmaster there are sorting and I go in and get my flat mail and start casing up the flat mail. There's only 
one other route in my office--it's a small office. But, so get it all cased up and sort my packages out and 
flag all those packages and get the car loaded and head out on the route. And I've got a lot of hardship 
dismounts on my route, which is handicapped people or something, you know that live alone and they're 
not able to get out to the mailbox anymore to get their mail and so I've got several of those folks that I try 
to help out. 
 
EH: Is that an official term, "hardship dismount"? 
 
BG: Yes, it is. Yeah. That's, and there's also a couple places that the folks are, it's a deviation to where it's 
still on the route but I swing into a driveway or something. The mailbox is really close to the end of their 
sidewalk or whatever and get their mail closer to the house for 'em. There's this one lady that she's blind 
so she can feel her way out to a mailbox on the outside of the door. So it makes it real handy for her to be 
able to still get her mail. So she's blind but I think there's somebody that comes along and helps her get 
her bills filled out and that sort of thing.  
 
EH: And how long does that take you and how long is your route? 
 
BG: The route is, it's classified as a 46K route and it's about I think it's 65 miles long and it's about 680 
mailboxes.  
 
EH: Wow. So does that mean some of them are closely compact in one area? 
 
BG: I have a few places that they're grouped together but one of 'ems the--there's a trailer park on my 
route that they're all grouped together, but the majority of all of 'em are scattered out. You have to drive a 
little ways between each one.  
 
EH: What year did you start as a sub and then when did you start full-time? 
 
BG: I started in 1994 I think it was, as a substitute. And then I think it was 2004 (sounds of Wayne 
Henderson working on a guitar in the background)? I think it was 2004 or 2006. I can't remember now 
(laughs) when I got the route full-time. But actually I started carrying full-time before the route actually 
became mine because the carrier that retired had a lot of time saved up so she got to, she got to go out and 
burn that time up so, but it didn't officially become my route until quite a while after she went on out.

EH: I see. Yeah. Tell me about your relationship with your customers, and maybe before that, talk about 
who your customers are. What kind of people.  
 
BG: Well, they're all, there's a few people that have moved in from outside the area, but the majority of 
the ones are folks that grew up in that community and, but when I first started carrying the route there 
was, I did it for a paycheck, did it because it was a good job and because I knew some other folks that 
were carrying the mail. And so that's, it started out as a paycheck. But then as I got to know the people in 
the community, it turned out to be a real rewarding experience because you became family members with 
a lot of the people, so. And there's a lot of folks that you know, even after the route's over with I still go 
and help them do things and one of the things that I started volunteering to do is, in our community there's 
a food bank that they come up from North Carolina and they set up in the community. They distribute 
food boxes to folks. So after I get off the route once a month, I go up there and help them load cars and 
then they put together some boxes for the crippled people on my mail route. And then when we get done 
distributing to the people that come, then I take those boxes around to the crippled people on my route. 
 
EH: Very nice. Yeah, how did some of those relationships develop? Was it just stopping to chat or they 
helping you get out of a stuck ditch or something like that? 
 
BG: (laughs) There have been some of that. There sure has! People have pulled me out of ditches and so 
forth. But when you carry the mail in a community for a long time, you learn the people and you learn 
who's got family and who doesn't, who's got help and who doesn't. And you know, some of the ones that 
are, have some hardships, you take pity on 'em and try to do a little something extra to make their lives a 
little more comfortable. And that sort of help had never really been discouraged in the Postal Service 
when I first started but as micromanagement has become more prevalent in the Postal Service, those kind 
of friendships I feel like, are being discouraged with rural mail carriers. They want you to, you know, 
move along, get it done as quick as possible and less personal relationships with your customers on the 
route. But I've been doing it so long now and I know everybody on my route, it's hard not to do those 
extra little things for the people that you care about. 
 
11:50  
 
EH: Yeah, tell me about how things have changed since you first started. 
 
BG: Well it first started changing with the DPS, you know where all the mail is, it's not coming in raw 
anymore. So that saves some time, but the scanners, the electronic scanners that they've got, it makes up 
for the time that you used to spend casing the raw mail because it seems like almost every other mailbox 
now, you're having to pull that scanner out, you're having to scan somebody's package you know, that 
informed delivery stuff, so it's still a good job. But I probably will be pretty excited when I get to retire, 
which is not too far down the road. 
 
EH: Yeah, how many years do you have left? 
 
BG: I think I've got about 5 more years to go. 
 
EH: Yeah, do you think, well has the scanners and you know the evaluation system, has that effected your 
pay at all? 
 
BG: Well it has because when I first started carrying the route, it was evaluated at a 48K route. [Redd 
Volkaert walks in the shop]

EH: Here, I can pause it. [tape cuts and restarts] Uh, what were we talking about? 
 
BG: Uh, the size of the route. It has decreased my route and as a route decreases, so does your pay, you 
know. But when I first started out it was a 48K route. 
 
EH: What does that mean? 
 
BG: It's evaluated at 48 hours. 
 
EH: Oh. 
 
BG: So now it's a 46 hour route. So but yeah there's been a little. But you know, and I've gone through all 
the step increases through the years and so I'm maxed out. I can't make any more than what I already 
make now. So when you're first starting out you start out A, B and C, and then once you get past C you 
start out steps 1, 2, 3, 4 on up. When you reach as high as you can go, that's it. However long you want to, 
there's not going to be any more increases like that in your pay grade.  
 
EH: Yeah. And K, does that mean you deliver on Saturday, or you don't deliver on Saturday? 
 
BG: I don't. I don't deliver Saturday--I get every Saturday off. 
 
EH: Okay. 
 
BG: Yeah. 
 
EH: Tell me about the vehicles you've had over the years and your favorite--the best equipped vehicle? 
 
BG: I really like the Subaru right-hand drives. They were good. I got a half a million miles on a couple of 
'em.  
 
EH: Wow! 
 
BG: Yeah! But I've carried in (clears throat) when I first started out, when I first got the job, I carried in a 
little stick shift Toyota and I had to shift gears between every box. And that was TOUGH. Real tough. 
And of course then when it looked like I was gonna be going full-time, then I started hunting for 
something a lot better. So I carried in Blazers, Broncos, I had a minivan for a little while, I ran a minivan 
on the route. And that was actually--I could get all kinds of packages in that thing. But my favorite is the 
one I've got now, which is a Honda CR-V and... 
 
EH: Is it right-hand drive? 
 
BG: No. And actually and I like the right-hand drive, but the way I carry the mail now, I sit in the 
passenger seat and I can drive left handed, and I've got a tray right in front of me and it's just, I've found 
that to be easier than the right-hand drives because I don't have to go over to the other seat to do the mail. 
It's right here, I can see it and POW! It goes right in the mailbox. 
 
EH: Uh-huh. Have you had any kind of injuries or physical problems with the repetitive motion?

BG: Well, Arthur's (Arthritis) got a hold of my right hand! So I don't know if that's due to you know 
gripping mail and throwing it in there or... 
 
EH: Yeah. 
 
BG: Or just age, but yeah, I don't have that in my left hand. But I'm getting Arthritis in my right hand.  
 
EH: Mmhm. 
 
BG: Those dern mailboxes! (laughs) 
 
EH: Do you think fiddling has anything to do with that? The bow hand? 
 
BG: No, yeah, that's my bow hand. So I can just tape the bow to my right hand and still play with my left. 
 
EH: (laughs) There you go! Yeah. What about things that customers leave you in the mailboxes for gifts. 
 
17:07  
 
BG: Oh! Christmastime is REAL nice. Yeah. I didn't have any idea about that. When I was a substitute 
carrier, there used to be, when I would carry on Saturdays, there would be goodies at Christmastime in the 
mailbox with the lady's name, that was the regular carrier, it had her name on it! So I was carrying all 
these goodies back to the post office for her and there was lots of goodies! And then as I got the route, 
then people started finding out that I got the route and through the years, started out slow but now it's I've 
considered putting a hitch on the back of the CR-V and pulling a little trailer there's so many goodies at 
Christmastime! 
 
EH: Like what kind of stuff? 
 
BG: I'm very blessed. There's people that make cakes and cookies and you know, people have left gift 
cards and that sort of thing. So there's--we're not supposed to take cash and stuff like that, you know. But 
I've been very blessed. The customers on my route, we've developed a nice relationship. 
 
EH: Can you talk about any times when you've had to help people or they helped you? 
 
BG: I've helped several folks. There's, I've helped people with flat tires. This was before all of the GPS 
tracking. Nowadays, you just can't afford that time anymore. I mean you have to answer, you have to 
answer for time spent doing stuff now. But before all that came in you know, there's an old man over in 
the Steven's Creek area that, he was by his self, he was elderly and he had a flat tire and he was struggling 
trying to get the car jacked up. And at that time you had time to do stuff like that! Pull off the side of the 
road and get out and jack the car up and change his tire for him and send him on. And there was one old 
lady that she didn't go out very often. She drove to church on Sundays and Monday when I came through 
with the mail, the car was sitting out and she'd asked me to back the car in her garage for her and I'd back 
the car in her garage and that sort of thing. And years ago you could you know, it was nothing to for 
people to ask you to pick up a bag of scratch chicken feed from the store on your way around their house 
or that sort of thing, but you can't do that kind of stuff anymore. 
 
EH: Yeah.

BG: But you're still as a mailman nowadays, you're still a member of the community. You're still as 
helpful as you can be, but there's, you can't do as much today as you could years ago. 
 
EH: Yeah. Yeah. Why don't you describe the area on your route--the landscape, especially for someone 
who's never been to this county. 
 
BG: Well, the town of Fries was a cotton mill town years ago and it's right on the New River. So there's a 
little section of town that I go through out to my route. And it's rolling hills pretty much. There's a lot of 
dead end hollers and stuff in between you know, mountain ridges and that sort of thing. And then I go up 
on Iron Mountain and it's very scary when there's snow on (laughs). There's no guardrails up there! And 
sometimes you just, I have to make sure I've got good snow tires on and the state truck hasn't been up 
there to plow yet. It depends on how bad the snow is. Sometimes I'll just wait until the state truck plows it 
out and they'll have to wait to get their mail. But yeah, Iron Mountain I guess is probably the most 
dangerous spot on the route that I've got. 
 
EH: Do you know how high that is in elevation? 
 
BG: I'm not sure what the elevation of it is. It's pretty high because I can be, there can be no snow 
anywhere else in Fries. You get halfway up that mountain and there's snow on the road. So it's a big 
change, it's almost like there's one section of it, there's a microclimate because once you get past that up 
on top, on up above, I've been on the very top where my route doesn't go, but I've gone up there later on, 
and it's different up there on top too. There will be nothing up there on top but right in 2/3rds of the way 
up the mountain it's like there's a microclimate where it's just a band of cold!  
 
EH: Crazy. So you probably learn a lot of these details of terrain that you might not, even having lived in 
a place your whole life, you might not totally know, because you're traveling these routes the same, you 
know, every day. 
 
BG: You travel the same roads every day, you know, know where all the potholes are (laughs). You know 
how close to the shoulder you can get in a lot of places. Yeah. Traveling the same roads, and then you 
know also the mailman can travel those roads a little faster than the average person because they're on 
them all the time. And you know how to look around the curves for you know, blind curves and stuff to 
know if somebody's coming. 
 
EH: Yeah. Have you seen the area change at all since you started doing that route? Like development, 
farm change, stuff like that? 
 
23:39  
 
BG: A little bit, yeah. The family farms are being...the family farms...There used to be several dairy farms 
on my route and there are NONE now. The dairy farming is over with in my neck of the woods. There 
seem to be more sheep farms than anything. And cattle farms. But there's no more tobacco farms, there's 
no more dairy farms. Hardly any vegetable growing. Just people's home gardens and that sort of thing--
which I get some of that as goodies too in the summertime! I get tomatoes in the mailbox and cucumbers 
and spring onions and that sort of thing. 
 
EH: Very nice. As a sheep farmer, is there a rise in sheep farming in that area? 
 
24:36

BG: Very much so. And sheep farming in southwest Virginia has really sprung up. I don't know if it's the 
fact that I'm also one of the only remaining sheep shearers in this part of the country too. So a lot of the 
times I get off the mail route and then I run to the house and get another vehicle that's got my shearing 
gear in it. And then I go to somebody locally--I go to a local sheep farm after work and shear sheep until 
10 o'clock at night.  
 
EH: Yeah, wow. 
 
BG: And then get up the next morning, carry the mail, go shear sheep, carry the mail, go shear sheep and 
then on the weekends when I'm, I do all my away trips sheep shearing with that. Last year I sheared 
probably about 2,000 head of sheep just in southwest Virginia and northern North Carolina. 
 
EH: Wow. 
 
BG: Yeah. 
 
EH: Do you think it's something with manageable, smaller livestock that is maybe more accessible to 
people? 
 
BG: Some of that but the sheep industry has really taken off. The price per pound that you can get for 
lamb now is more than what you can get for cattle. And I've got cows too but, and then plus with sheep 
there's--the gestational period is only 5 months and with cattle it's 9. So you're producing a product pretty 
fast and lambs, you can have lambs ready for the market in 90 days.  
 
EH: Whoa.  
 
BG: They're ready to go.  
 
EH: That's crazy. 
 
BG: Now that beef that you're raising takes a lot longer. But with sheep there's a whole lot more hands-on 
management with sheep. Kind of like the Postal Service! (laughs) 
 
EH: Yeah, that's right! So what are the connections between maybe carrying the mail, being a musician, 
being a sheep shearer or sheep farmer? Are there skills that cross over? 
 
BG: Just good, hard honest work in all those fields! (laughs) 
 
EH: (laughs) You can listen to music while you carry the mail. 
 
BG: I can listen to music and a lot of times I listen to the radio station out of Mt. Airy, North Carolina, 
WPAQ. I listen to them and I get excited once in a while when they play some Konnarock Critter [Brian's 
old band] music! (laughs) 
 
EH: They still have the cassette. 
 
BG: They still have the cassette. Well actually we did a couple CDs too later on. But there's some CD 
music out there.

EH: Nice. What's your favorite part of the job? 
 
BG: Favorite part of the job is I guess knowing that it's something that I'm doing that is beneficial to 
people on my route. You know, there's elderly people that on my route that I feel like they look for their 
newspaper and they get excited when they get their newspaper in the mail. It feels good knowing that I'm 
delivering something that they're looking forward to getting and you know, it's been really rewarding 
being a mailman. I wasn't sure to the extent of it. And if first it was really hard, but as it became easier 
and like second nature, carrying the mail, the friendships that I've built with people. It feels good knowing 
that I'm a revered member of the community, you know. So I always have to be good. The mailman can't 
never be bad because your car's known everywhere! (laughs) 
 
EH: That's right! (laughs) Yeah, people know you. What's the most challenging part of it? Or the part that 
you don't like? 
 
28:57  
 
BG: The part that I don't like I guess is all the micromanagement, you know? It's bad enough that, not bad 
enough, but I feel like it's enough to have the postmaster in the post office say here's what is expected 
from you, you know, you got the job, we're a work family in here. And that's the way it started out as, and 
it was, it felt good! Everybody was on the same team, everybody worked good with one another as co-
workers. And I guess the micromanagement part of it, it's changed it. It really has. Some people like that 
sort of thing. But when you start out not having it, developing a rapport with people out in the community 
and then you have to take a step back and you're micromanaged to that point, it's different. It's changed it.  
 
EH: And the customers don't necessarily know why you have to speed up and can't chat. 
 
BG: Yeah, they don't. And it's rude, a lot of time when you pull off from the mailbox and you can't stand 
there and talk to them, you have to pull away! And they get upset and they feel like you're being rude. So. 
 
EH: Yeah. Are you a member of the union? 
 
BG: I am, yes.  
 
EH: And that's the North Carolina Rural Letter Carriers Association? Or the National? 
 
BG: Um, it's the one in southwest Virginia. 
 
EH: Oh yeah, yeah! Sorry. 
 
BG: Southwest Virginia. 
 
EH: Yeah, I was just in North Carolina. (laughs) 
 
BG: (laughs) 
 
EH: Yeah, southwest Virginia. Got it.

BG: We usually meet--it alternates when we've not had anything because of COVID for a long time, but 
we usually meet in Wytheville, Virginia. And then the next time it'll be in Hillsville, Virginia, so that's the 
2 places we meet most of the time. Alternate.  
 
EH: Yeah, Kelly Magalis, I think who was the previous president in the state put me in touch with some 
folks. 
 
BG: Oh really. 
 
EH: Yeah. Yeah, what is the union-- what have they done to advocate for carriers since you've been a 
member? 
 
31:33  
 
BG: Well, they, as far as the rural carriers as a group, you know, they've, they're always advocating for 
better benefits and that sort of thing for us. But I had to have some--I had a postmaster at one time that 
she got, it was over the you know, the relationship I had with the community and she said I was too slow 
to be a mailman! She was on me all the time! I had to get the union involved. But they helped me out, so. 
Glad to be a member. 
 
EH: Yeah, because the postmaster's technically your boss so they are not in the union. 
 
BG: Immediately. 
 
EH: Yeah, yeah. 
 
BG: Yeah, right. 
 
EH: Yeah, I'm sensing that.  
 
BG: Right. (laughs) 
 
EH: Let's see what else. 
 
BG: It's a shame that it's, it's a shame that it seems, it feels like it's us versus them a lot. And it's not 
pleasant working in an environment like that, but just you know, for being part of the community, 
knowing that I'm serving the community, you just try to overlook some of those other things that come 
down the line. You just go back and keep thinking, I'm needed in this community and you're helping folks 
and plus you're getting paid well, so. 
 
EH: How do you equip yourself in your vehicle for weather? Are there things that you always have with 
you in your car? 
 
BG: Oh yeah, there's the ice scrapers for your shoes. I carry those cable chains. I have needed those cable 
chains so it's just a strand you know. Have you ever seen those cable chains? It's a strand of metal with 
rollers on it. 
 
EH: Okay.

BG: So they go on, you just drive, lay 'em out in front of your car and you drive over top of 'em and then 
you strap them over your tire. They hook together. So it's not like the big chain, honkin' chains that they 
used to have years ago. So these are real fast to put on and take off. They don't hold up as long, but just 
the convenience of being able to get 'em on and off fast. But yeah, I had to put those on in a snowstorm 
trying to get to the post office one morning!  
 
EH: Wow. 
 
BG: Yeah! Even with snow tires on! It was STILL icy conditions and the only way to get to work was to 
put those cable chains on in the dark! (laughs) That was no fun.  
 
EH: What are the stories that when people ask you about your job, what are the stories you tell about 
maybe a wild occurrence or weird day or bad weather or something like that? 
 
BG: Oh my! Hmm. Well, I'm not sure right off. I guess I'd have to think about that one. 
 
EH: Yeah. Is there any kind of language or jokes or stories that rural mail carriers tell to each other when 
you get together? Or do you complain about common things? 
 
BG: Oh yeah! Everybody always complains about their postmaster and that sort of thing, you know. But 
we've got a good one now. She really, she does as much as she can to you know, be real accommodating 
to the carriers and she's, she was hired back around the same time as I was, so she remembers those work 
family kind of relationships and that sort of thing, so she's probably one of the better ones we've ever had. 
Hopefully I won't have to work too many more years before she retires! (laughs) Because it's a lot nicer 
place to work. When you've got good management, a good boss, it makes the world of difference. When 
you've got somebody that's riding you all the time, telling you you're too slow to be a mailman, it kinda 
makes you not look forward to going to work each day.  
 
EH: For sure. What do you think the future is for the job and you know, rural delivery in general?  
 
BG: Well, it's looking pretty scary because you know, everybody does the computers now and there's, 
years ago it used to be the only way you had to correspond was telephone or the mail and now everything 
is online. And I have a feeling eventually the Postal Service will be mainly a package delivery service. It's 
kind of the way I feel it's--I have a feeling that's what's coming down the pike. That's just what I see in the 
stars. 
 
EH: And you've probably seen a huge increase in packages since you started.

BG: Oh yes. Amazon has (laughs) done a lot for the Postal Service. Yeah, it's, you can always tell when 
the community has come into a little money. When they did the stimulus checks, it's like Christmas in 
there, you know, and when it's, actually the other day I walked in and it was like Christmas in there again 
and I said, what's going on--did they give out another stimulus check? And she said, "Nope, tax returns." 
So tax return season, everybody's getting packages. 
 
EH: Got it. 
 
BG: So (laughs)

EH: Well is there anything else we haven't talked about or that you'd like to share? 
 
BG: I feel very blessed to have the opportunity that I've had with the Postal Service. With everything that 
I've, with my music, with sheep shearing and I just felt like I've had a good life between all 3 of those 
jobs. So I've been very blessed, very fortunate.  
 
EH: And 5 years left. 
 
BG: 5 year left. I'm out of the soup bowl.  
 
EH: (laughs) 
 
BG: And then I might come over here and help Wayne Henderson make guitars! 
 
EH: Yeah, there you go! 
 
BG: Or fiddles! (laughs) 
 
EH: The Retired Mailmen's Club. 
 
BG: Yeah! The Retired Mailmen's Club. (laugh) 
 
EH: Well thank you so much! 
 
BG: Thank you! I appreciate it, Emily. Thank you very much.
