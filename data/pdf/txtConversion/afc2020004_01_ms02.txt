Alex Jacobs:  “Trudell.” I wrote this poem for John Trudell after watching Heather Rae’s 
documentary. And when people hear the name Trudell, they know. They know.  
 
[Alex Jacobs reads “Trudell”] 
 
AJ:  “Trudell” was written after viewing the documentary Trudell by Heather Rae in 2006. I had 
first met and read poetry with John Trudell at the American Indian Community House in New 
York City in the mid 1990’s. We met again over the years, mostly in Santa Fe, New Mexico. 
 
While poetry editor at Akwesasne Notes (Mohawk Nation), I positively and enthusiastically 
reviewed his first poetry collection Living in Reality (1982). This became the basis for his first 
record release Tribal Voice (1983), where he combined his words with Native drum music and 
singing. I was honored when he agreed that I was chosen to write his tribute (for Indian Country 
Today) as he was preparing to “walk on” due to cancer in December 2017. 
 
“Trudell” was included in the collaborative project “GOT YOUR BACK” with Mohawk poet Janet 
Marie Rogers, for her Ojistah Productions in 2012. The vocal track was recorded in Santa Fe, 
New Mexico, at JOOTS Studio in August 2011; my son laid the music track later at his studio in 
St. Regis Mohawk. Ms. Rogers produced the CD in Vancouver, British Columbia. This was a 
spoken word and music project with several Native deejays, including my son, DJ Duran Flint 
Jacobs, who did the music for “Trudell.” DJ Duran Flint continues to produce our spoken word 
and music projects, the newest being titled Red Tomahawk.  
 
I am currently at the St. Regis Mohawk Indian Nation on the New York-Quebec border. I travel 
cross country to Santa Fe, New Mexico, on a regular basis for my art and poetry projects. Alex 
Jacobs.
