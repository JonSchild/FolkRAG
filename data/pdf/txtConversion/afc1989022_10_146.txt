Italian-American Architecture: Nevada 
Thomas Carter 
Overview 
January 25, 1990 
During the early part of December 1989, I traveled to Nevada 
under the auspices of the American Folklife Center to document 
several sites for the Library of Congress's Italian-Americans in  
the West exhibit, planned for summer 1992. 
My objective was to 
record in a very short time the widest possible range of Italian-
American building activity in the state. 
The first step was to 
narrow the field. 
I knew that Howard Marshall of the American 
Folklife Center had worked extensively with the Italian-American 
stonemasons of Paradise Valley, Nevada, so there was no need to 
duplicate this research [See Alborn and Marshall, Buckaroos in  
Paradise (Washington, D.C.: Library of Congress, 1980)] If we 
needed good examples of rock buildings laid up by Italian 
immigrants I was certain that we could turn to Marshall's 
research. 
My contribution to the project could come in lesser 
known areas like the architecture of mining and perhaps even 
ranching. 
Blanton Owen, Nevada State Folklorist, had, during the 
course of this travels, discovered an intriquing ranch in 
southern Nevada's Lincoln county. 
This ranch, the Joe Delmue 
Ranch, appeared to have strong Old World associations, 
representing, on the conservative end of the spectrum, the 
survival of Italian folk culture in the West. 
To balance the old 
with the new, Blanton suggested Benny Demele's Dry Creek Ranch, a 
site fitting the typical mode of Nevada's Buckaroo country. 
Since we had only three days for fieldwork, we decided to 
document the Delmue Ranch as an example of Italian architecture 
in Nevada and the Demele Ranch for its connection to the Italian-
American experience. 
In between we would look closely at the 
mining camp architecture of Eureka to see what kind of buildings 
Italian-American miners would have known and used during the boom 
years of immigration. 
Although more time would have yielded more 
depth in the data, the fieldwork produced a useful portrait of 
the diversity of Italian-American architecture in Nevada. 
As expected, archival research revealed the Joe Delmue house 
(1900) and barn (1916) in Lincoln County to be exceptional 
examples of Italian architecture in the United States. 
The house 
is not indicative of the oldest Italian peasant tradition, but 
rather reflects the newer Neoclassical style that was becoming 
popular with Europe's bourgeoisie during the second half of the 
nineteenth century. 
The house is symmetrically arranged and 
there is a round arch over the centrally placed front entrance. 
The stone is polished on the front, yielding an attractive and 
even elegant appearance. 
In plan, the house may be classified as 
a pair house --a three room wide house consisting of a pair of 
units flanking a larger central unit. 
Pair houses are found 
throughout Europe [See Thomas Carter, "Danes," in America's  
Architectural Roots: Ethnic Groups that Built America, ed. by 
Dell Upton (Washington, D.C.: The Preservation Press, 1986), 118-
123] and demonstrates the widespread acceptance of Neoclassical 
(and essentially Palladian) ideals at the vernacular level. 
The 
pair house is encountered in northern Italy [See Francesco 
Bocchi,  L'architettura Populare in Italia: Emilia-Romagna (Rome: 
Laterza and Figli Spa, 1984), 40] and its transfer to Nevada is 
documented both in print [See the main residence at the Battiste 
Recanzone and Angelo Forgnone Ranch, Paradise Valley, Humboldt 
County, in Thompson and West, Iiistory of Nevada (Oakland: 
Thompson and West, 1881), 344] and by recent fieldwork [See the 
main house at the Cardano Ranch, Curry, White Pine County]. 
The 
main central unit in the Delmue house was undivided and probably 
was originally used as a combination living room and kitchen. 
The only large fireplace was located in the back wall of this 
space. 
The flanking units were each divided into two small rooms 
that may initially have been bedrooms. 
The room to the right as 
you enter from the main door could have been a more formal 
parlor, although we did not have time to find proper evidence of 
this use. 
To the rear, carved out of the hillside, was a long 
corridor-like cellar with a partially vaulted ceiling. 
A 
separate kitchen was added later to one end of the back wall. 
The principal Delmue barn--the 1916 barn--is equally 
impressive and also has parallels in Italy. 
The barn is, for one 
thing, huge, measuring approximately 50 feet wide and 80 feet 
long. 
The ground plan is divided into three parts. 
The largest 
is in the middle and consists of a long narrow space that is at 
least two full stories high. 
The hay was stacked here under an 
efficient gambrel roof. 
On both sides of this central unit are 
found smaller single story shed roof extensions. 
The north unit 
was used as a stable while the function of the one to the south 
is not known. 
The construction technique employed in the barn is Italian 
in origin. 
The roof is fully carried by a series of free 
standing pillars, four along each side of the center bay and four 
supporting the shed roof in the south bay. 
These pillars are 
stone and slightly tapered. 
This kind of barn technology is 
unknown in the United States [Allen Noble, Wood, Brick. and  
Stone: The North American Settlement Landscape, Volume Two: Barns  
and Farm Structures (Amherst: The University of Massachusetts 
Press, 1984), 1-69] but common in northern Italy [See Bocchi, 
L'architettura Populare in Italia: Emilia-Romagna, 16, 21, 39, 
40, 42, 43]. 
In Italy the spaces between the pillars are usually 
left open or infilled with stone. 
On the Nevada frontier, 
however, Joe Delmue closed in his barn walls with horizontally 
stacked railroad ties. 
Benny Demele's Dry Creek Ranch, displaying the architectural 
features of the typical northern Nevada Buckaroo ranch, stands as 
an appropriate contrast to the ethnic conservativism of the Joe 
Delmue's place. 
Many Italian immigrants moved from mining to 
ranching and in so doing adopted the occupational and 
architectural traditions of the dominant American culture. 
Although there are currently no surveys of northern Nevada ranch 
architecture [the human landscape of Buckaroo country is treated 
peripherally in Alborn and Marshall, Buckaroos in Paradise, 38-
45; and in Andrea Graham and Blanton Owen, Lander County Line:  
Folklife in Central Nevada (Reno: Nevada State Council on the 
Arts, 1988); and Thomas Carter and Carl Fleischhauer, The Grouse  
Creek Cultural Survey: Integrating Folklife and Historic  
Presevation Research (Washington, D.C.: Library of Congress, 
1988), 30], fieldwork in the region during 1989-1990 reveals a 
general picture of this significant American building tradition. 
In addition to the main ranch house, which may be any one of 
a number of building types, the Buckaroo Ranch consists of a 
cookhouse, some sort of bunkhouse (its size and shape determined 
by the size of the ranch operation), a long flat-roofed horse 
barn, round horse corrals, and any number of regular corrals and 
storage sheds. 
Additionally, there may be a blacksmith shop or 
equipment maintenance shed (these may be substantial buildings on 
the larger ranches), a double-walled icehouse, as well as any 
number of smaller houses for the cow boss and married buckaroos. 
The architectural features of the Demele Ranch are consistent 
with this tradition. 
The Demele house is basically a two-room stone house that 
has lived through a number of additions to the front and rear. 
It has the dirt-covered pole roof that was common in the region 
during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. 
The 
stonework on the house may be that of an Italian immigrant 
stonemason, but there was no clear evidence that such was the 
case. 
Although there was a large frame chicken coop, a stone 
bunkhouse, and a stone blacksmith shop at the site, the most 
signficant structure on the Demele Ranch was the flat-roofed 
horse barn. 
These barns--sometimes just called "outbuildings" by 
the buckaroos--are diagnostic of the Buckaroo region and are ably 
represented by the one at the Demele Ranch. 
It is long--over 90 
feet in length--and built back into a hillside so that it is 
partially subterranean. 
The roof is composed of large purlins 
running parallel to the long side of the building. 
The purlins 
are supported either by poles set directly in the ground or stone 
interior walls. 
Across the purlins are laid small poles--usually 
Aspen--which in turn are covered with willow and clay. 
Inside 
the barn are, in order, an open corral, a granary built with 
dimensional lumber, a horse stall and tack room formed by placing 
cedar poles vertically in the ground (called "stockade" 
construction by the buckaroos), and an enclosed stable for the 
Demele's work horses. 
There is nothing Italian about the Demele 
barn, but it demonstrates the degree to which Italian-Americans 
entered into the Buckaroo culture of the region. 
Finally, a word needs to be said regarding the architectural 
landscape of Eureka. 
While Italian immigrants may have comprised 
a sizeable segment of the town's population, they contributed 
very little to it basic architectural stock. 
As in other western 
mining communities, the Italians of Eureka chose expediency over 
ethnicity, as least in housing. 
The basic house types found in 
Eureka--the cross wing, the side-passage, and the single cell--
are omnipresent in the industrialized West. 
These are the houses 
miners and mining companies built throughout the region: they 
were cheap; they fit the narrow urban town lots, and they were, 
in their own way, quite fashionable during their time. 
As the 
Italian immigrants became Italian-Americans, they moved naturally 
into the architectural mainstream of America. 
For signs of an Italian heritage, architectural historians 
must look behind the houses to the gardens where food was grown 
and to the small outbuildings where food was processed and wine 
made. 
In Eureka, such tangible signs of immigrant life were not 
overtly evident. 
More intensive fieldwork probably would have 
turned up more evidence of contemporary Italian-American material 
culture, but such work was not possible during our cursory survey 
of the town's resources.

THE ARCHITECTURE 
OF IMMIGRATION 
Docinuenting Italian-American 
Vernacular Buildings 
in Ul,ah and Nevada 
THOMAS CARTER 
n 
1990 when the American Folklife Cen-
ter invited a 
team of teachers and stu-
dents from the University of Utah's Gradu-
ate School of Architecture to document with 
photos and measured drawings buildings 
constructed by Italian immigrants in central 
Utah and eastern Nevada, some colleagues 
were skeptical. Italian architecture in the 
West? Was there such a 
thing? For these 
people, as for many westerners, hyphen-
rated America, the world of Italian-Ameri-
cans and other immigrant groups, lay to the 
east in the big urban centers of Boston, New 
York, and Chicago. They told us to forget 
about Italian buildings and look on the 
ranches and in the mining towns for real 
western architecture. 
And that is what we did. We ,vent to 
the ranches and mining towns and found 
what we knew we would find, both Italians 
and, not surprisingly, buildings constructed 
by, lived in, and used by Italians. We knew 
they were there simply because the West is 
and always has been a 
land of cultural di-
versity. Particular stereotypes die hard, but 
the old image of the West as the exclusive 
domain of cowboys and Indians is one that 
badly needs discarding, simply because it is 
wrong. Western historians such as Patricia 
Limerick have worked diligently in recent 
years to remind us that western America 
shared, as she says in The Legacy of 
Con-
quest, "in the transplanted diversity of Eu-
rope. Expansion (westwardl involved peoples 
of every background: English, Irish, Cor-
nish, Scottish, French, German, Portuguese, 
Scandinavian, Greek, and Russian." And Ital-
ians. Or better yet, Italian-Americans, since 
once in their new surroundings these innni-
grants became Americans, and their experi-
ence became an American experience. For 
many, Italy was now only a 
memory. The 
reality was making a 
living and, more spe-
cifically, making a 
living in the American 
West of the late nineteenth and early twen-
tieth centuries. Jobs for Italian-Americans 
came initially in the region's mines. Leer, 
some of the newcomers switched to farming 
and ranching. And it is in mining towns of 
Utah and Nevada and to a 
lesser extent on 
the ranches of Nevada's high desert that we 
may find the architecture of Italian-American 
immigration. 
T
lie idea of an architecture of immigra-
tion is nothing new: people have been 
studying America's imported building tradi-
tions for years. Nonetheless, simple defini-
tions are hard to find. For many, immigrant 
buildings are roughly synonymous with eth-
nic buildings, with "ethnic" implying the 
presence of a 
set of special, culturally derived 
architectural traits that serve to distinguish 
one immigrant group both from other immi-
grant groups and from the dominant host 
culture. Thus, immigrant architecture is the 
architecture of ethnicity: the self-conscious 
expression of old-world identity through 
buildings. Ethnicity in architecture may be 
expressed through the simple retention of 
traditional building practices, in new archi-
tectural forms evolving from older ones, or it 
may even be invented by singling out a 
cer-
tain architectural image of the homeland for 
highlighting, thereby creating a 
new form. 
All these kinds of ethnic architecture are 
found in Utah and Nevada Italian-American 
communities. 
Yet in planning the work for this project, 
our team knew there was another, less well-
known side to immigrant architecture that 
also deserved attention. Most Italian-Ameri-
cans in the West did not build in the style 
of their homeland. In the western United 
States, as in the nation as a 
whole, great num-
bers of immigrants adopted the architectural 
styles of the mainstream American culture. 
What should we do with buildings that ex-
press Americanization rather than ethnicity? 
r1h 
ft 61 
Are they not part of the architecture of im-
migration? If some of the Italians coming 
to the West chose to reveal their old-world 
affinities through architecture, there were 
others who affirmed allegiance to their new 
homeland by building American houses, a 
house being, after all, the most conspicuous 
and lasting of personal symbols. Still other 
immigrants (and this may be the majority) 
simply had no choice in the matter. 
The American West encountered by 
most of the arriving Italians was already 
heavily industrialized. After all, it was the 
news of jobs in the mines and smelters and 
on the railroads that brought them there in 
the first place. The immigrants' West was an 
urban one of blackened skies, smokestacks, 
piles of detritus from the smelters, and small 
houses perched precariously on hillsides. 
In this world, newcomers became renters, 
bought existing houses, or, if they could af-
ford to, built in the expedient style of the 
western mining town. Not surprisingly per-
haps, western mining town housing looks 
much the same from Arizona to Montana, 
being part of a 
larger industrial system that 
covered much of the region during the pe-
riod of immigration. Such housing, although 
overtly nonethnic, is nevertheless part and 
parcel of the immigrant experience. It is an 
architecture that calls attention to the simple 
truth that for many immigrants the expres-
sion of ethnicity through architecture was 
simply unaffordable. 
T
his is not to say that Italians left no spe-
cial mark on the urban environment. 
They did, certainly. But the signs are not al-
ways obvious. In western towns one has to 
look carefully for the architecture of Italian-
American ethnicity. You can see it in the 
quantity and quality of stone buildings, for 
one thing. Masonry was one area where Ital-
ians excelled, and where there were Italians 
there was likely to be finely crafted stone-
work of all kinds. It is visible too in out-
buildings—buildings out behind the main 
house—where sausage and wine were made, 
tomatoes canned, herbs dried, and bread 
baked. Structures like these were often make-
shift affairs, created of necessity from what-
ever materials were available, but they were 
nevertheless indispensible features in a 
do-
mestic landscape subtly but stubbornly ori-
ented toward the production and processing 
of food. 
The architecture of Italian-Americans in 
the West, then, displays great variety. Some 
of it—mostly buildings found in the more 
rural areas where social and economic con-
straints were less rigid—looks as if it could 
have been built in Italy. Other examples are 
purely American. We felt that our work 
should show both sides, the Italian and the 
American, and we therefore wanted to in-
clude the widest possible range of build-
ings in our survey. Accordingly, we chose 
to focus our attention on two urban cen-
ters, Helper, in Carbon County, Utah, and 
Eureka in Eureka County, Nevada, as well 
as several outlying farms in Carbon County 
and two ranches in Nevada known to be 
owned by Italian-Americans. The following 
illustrations were chosen to represent the 
Graduate School of Architecture's contribu-
tion to the Italian-Americans in the West 
Project. The drawings are by graduate stu-
dents Susan Anderson, Bee Bergold, Steve 
Simmons, and Doug Banks. Professor Darla 
Linberg-Berreth provided the artistic super-
vision. Background information on the indi-
vidual sites was supplied by Steve Siporin, 
Phil Notarriani, Blanton Owen, and Andrea 
Graham. Special thanks to Pete Tony and

built in two stages. The original dwelling was 
single-story in height and consisted of two 
rooms—a bedroom and a 
kitchen—built half-
way into the hillside. Later, a 
second story was 
added of brick rescued from the demolition of 
the Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad 
Company roundhouse in nearby Helper. In Italy 
two-level houses like this often had animals sta-
bled on the ground floor, and Manina perpetu-
ated this tradition in Carbon County by locating 
a 
small donkey stall next to the kitchen. Draw-
ing by Susan Anderson

County, Utah. The Manina House was con-
structed during the late 1920s and early 1930s 
by immigrants Camillo Manina, Domenic Conca, 
John Manina, and Virginio Marzo. Its partially 
subterranean design and stone construction are 
typical of housing in the Dlanina's native village 
of Novalesa, in the Province of Torino, Italy. 
Camillo Manina worked in the Carbon County 
coal mines, but raised most of what he needed

The design of the house Joseph

rope's burgeoning middle-class during the nine-

Delmue made reference to a 
symbol of economic 
attainment familiar in his home country, al-
though the imposing stone building probably 
had the desired effect in Nevada as well. By the 
turn of the century, Joe Delmue was doing well 
in America and it showed in the kind of house 
he could afford to build. Sixteen years later, 
it showed in his barn too. Drawing by Doug

1916 barn is truly monumental, measuring ap-
proximately fifty feet wide and eighty feet long. 
The distinctive plan, composed of a 
long aisle 
with flanking naves, is based on 1
-uropean pro-
totypes. The Delmues stacked hay in the main 
aisle, stabled their horses in the north side, and 
used the south section for feeding cattle. The 
roof is Swiss-Italian style, where the plate tim-
bers are supported by free-standing pillars. In 
the Delmuc barn, there are four stone pillars 
along each side of the center aisle and four 
supporting the shed roof in the south side. 7

Stone miners' houses along Milano Court, off 
Welby Street, Helper, Carbon County, Utah. Joe 
Milano had these stone houses built in 1911. 
They are single-story examples of the ubiquitous 
foursquare house type, a 
house type identified 
by its square, box-like shape and pyramidal 
roof. The Milanos occupied several of the houses 
while renting the rest for extra income. Mi-
lano was a 
blacksmith who came from Forno 
Canavese in the Province of Torino, Italy. The 
stonework is believed to have been done by

signal a

immigrant foodways in America. According to 
the Verde family history, it was Tony Verde, 
born in 1914, who built the domed bake oven, 
much in the style of those found in the Cala-

Site plan of the Verde (louse Lot, Ifelper, Carbon 
County, Utah. Elsewhere in this volume folklor-
ist Steve Siporin argues forcefully and correctly 
for a 
rethinking of the immigrant labor experi-
ence. Siporin notes that during the early twenti-
eth century miners in towns like Ifelper did not 
work year-round. The mines operated on a 
supply-and-demand basis, and the miners often 
found themselves working short weeks or not 
at all during months when the need for coal 
dropped. An unpredictable income coupled with 
already low wages made it important for miners 
and their families to produce much of their own 
food, and to develop other sources of revenue. In 
mining towns like Ifelper it is customary to find 
Italian-American houselots cluttered with out-
buildings of various kinds, places where raw 
materials—mostly produce from the garden and 
animals such as pigs, chickens, and rabbits— 
were processed into food. The Verde place is a 
good example of the Italian-American houselot: 
there is a 
large garden, a 
canning shed, an out-
door bake oven, a 
wine cellar (where sausage 
was also stored), and a 
rabbit hutch. Drawing by

Bruno outbuildings, elevation and ground plan, 
Helper, Carbon County, Utah. Like many other 
immigrant families, the Brunos raised and pro-
cessed most of their own food. They also supple-
mented their income by taking in renters and 
doing small jobs for the mines. The center for 
this activity on the Bruno houselot was a 
small 
wooden building, unassuming in appearance, 
that played a 
significant role in the family's life 
in America. As he was finishing his new house, 
Joe Bruno also dragged a 
two-room building 
from an adjacent lot and placed it over a 
newly 
dug cellar. The south room was then rented 
out to single miners, while the north room was 
used for canning tomatoes, drying herbs like 
garlic and oregano, and for making sausage, 
wine, and lard. The wine barrels, ceramic lard 
vessels, and dried sausage were stored in the 
cellar. In the late 1930s a 
garage for the family 
car was attached to the north end of the building 
and then in 1960 another room was added 
where the family earned extra money by taking 
on maintenance jobs for the Denver and Rio 
Grande Western railroad. Drawing by Bee

system—is brought into the lot from both the 
north and east font one of the town's main irri-
gation canals. Smaller ditches then move water 
to the orchard on the north and the main vege-
table garden on the cast. After it passes through 
orchard and garden , 
the water is piped onto the 
lawn around the house, and whatever is left over 
is funneled in an underground pipe to a 
daugh-
ter's house in the next block. The Brttnos have 
always had apple, apricot, peach, pear, and 
plum trees; and their garden yields the neces-
sary herbs for Italian cuisine like basil , 
oregano, 
and parsley. Peppers came in all sizes and tem-
peratures, and the vegetables usually consisted 
of fava beans, zucchini, and other kinds of 
squash. Finally, out along or across the ditch 
there were rabbit hutches, a 
chicken coop, and 
a 
hog pen—the humble dwellings are the stUff 
of life for an Italian-American household. Draw-

TIIC ARCHITECTURE 
OF IMMIGRATION 
Documenting Italian-American 
Vernacular Buildings 
in Milli and Nevada 
THOMAS CARTER 
I
n 
1990 when the American Folklife Cen-
ter invited a 
team of teachers and stu-
dents from the University of Utah's Gradu-
ate School of Architecture to document with 
photos and measured drawings buildings 
constructed by Italian immigrants in central 
Utah and eastern Nevada, some colleagues 
were skeptical. Italian architecture in the 
West? Was there such a 
thing? For these 
people, as for many westerners, hyphen-
tated America, the world of Italian-Ameri-
cans and other immigrant groups, lay to the 
east in the big urban centers of Boston, New 
York, and Chicago. They told us to forget 
about Italian buildings and look on the 
ranches and in the training towns for real 
western architecture. 
And that is what we did. We went to 
the ranches and mining towns and found 
what we knew we would find, both Italians 
and, not surprisingly, buildings constructed 
by, lived in, and used by Italians. We knew 
they were there simply because the West is 
and always has been a 
land of cultural di-
versity. Particular stereotypes die hard, but 
the old image of the West as the exclusive 
domain of cowboys and Indians is one that 
badly needs discarding, simply because it is 
wrong. Western historians such as Patricia 
Limerick have worked diligently in recent 
years to remind us that western America 
shared, as she says in The Legacy of Con-
quest, "in the transplanted diversity of Eu-
rope. Expansion [westward) involved peoples 
of every background: English, Irish, Cor-
nish, Scottish, French, German, Portuguese, 
Scandinavian, Greek, and Russian." And Ital-
ians. Or better yet, Italian-Americans, since 
once in their new surroundings these immi-
grants became Americans, and their experi-
ence became an American experience. For 
many, Italy was now only a 
memory. The 
reality was making a 
living and, more spe-
cifically, making a 
living in the American 
West of the late nineteenth and early twen-
tieth centuries. Jobs for Italian-Americans 
came initially in the region's mines. L 
uer, 
some of the newcomers switched to farming 
and ranching. And it is in mining towns of 
Utah and Nevada and to a 
lesser extent can 
the ranches of Nevada's high desert that we 
may find the architecture of Italian-American 
immigration. 
T
he idea of an architecture of immigra-
tion is nothing new: people have been 
studying Arnerica's imported building tradi-
tions for years. Nonetheless, simple defini-
tions are hard to find. For many, immigrant 
buildings are roughly synonymous with eth-
nic buildings, with "ethnic" implying the 
presence of a 
set of special, culturally derived 
architectural traits that serve to distinguish 
one immigrant group both from other immi-
grant groups and from the dominant host 
culture. Thus, immigrant architecture is the 
architecture of ethnicity: the self-conscious 
expression of old-world identity through 
buildings. Ethnicity in architecture may be 
expressed through the simple retention of 
traditional building practices, in new archi-
tectural forms evolving from older ones, or it 
may even be invented by singling out a 
cer-
tain architectural image of the homeland for 
highlighting, thereby creating it new form. 
All these kinds of ethnic architecture are 
found in Utah and Nevada Italian-American 
communities. 
Yet in planning the work for this project, 
our team knew there was another, less well-
known side to immigrant architecture that 
also deserved attention. Most Italian-Ameri-
cans in the West did not build in the style 
of their homeland. In the western United 
States, as in the nation as a 
whole, great num-
hers of immigrants adopted the architectural 
styles of the mainstream American culture. 
What should we do with buildings that ex-
press Americanization rather than ethnicity? 
Are they not part of the architecture of im-
migration? If some of the Italians coming 
to the West chose to reveal their old-world 
affinities through architecture, there were 
others who affirmed allegiance to their new 
homeland by building American houses, a 
house being, after all, the most conspicuous 
and lasting of personal symbols. Still other 
immigrants (and this may be the majority) 
simply had no choice in the matter. 
The American West encountered by 
most of the arriving Italians was already 
heavily industrialized. After all, it was the 
news of jobs in the mines and smelters and 
on the railroads that brought them there in 
the first place. The immigrants' West was an 
urban one of blackened skies, smokestacks, 
piles of detritus from the smelters, and small 
houses perched precariously on hillsides. 
In this world, newcomers became renters, 
bought existing houses, or, if they could af-
ford to, built in the expedient style of the 
western mining town. Not surprisingly per-
haps, western mining town housing looks 
much the same from Arizona to Montana, 
being part of a 
larger industrial system that 
covered much of the region during the pe-
riod of immigration. Such housing, although 
overtly nonethnic, is nevertheless part and 
parcel of the immigrant experience. It is an 
architecture that calls attention to the simple 
truth that for many immigrants the expres-
sion of ethnicity through architecture was 
simply unaffordable. 
T
his is not to say that Italians left no spe-
cial mark on the urban environment. 
They did, certainly. But the signs are not al-
ways obvious. In western towns one has to 
look carefully for the architecture of Italian-
American ethnicity. You can see it in the 
quantity and quality of stone buildings, for 
one thing. Masonry was one area where Ital-
ians excelled, and where there were Italians 
there was likely to be finely crafted stone-
work of all kinds. It is visible too in out-
buildings—buildings out behind the main 
house—where sausage and wine were made, 
tomatoes canned, herbs dried, and bread 
baked. Structures like these were often make-
shift affairs, created of necessity from what-
ever materials were available, but they were 
nevertheless indispensible features in a 
do-
mestic landscape subtly but stubbornly ori-
ented toward the production and processing 
of food. 
The architecture of Italian-Americans in 
the West, then, displays great variety. Some 
of it—mostly buildings found in the more 
rural areas where social and economic con-
straints were less rigid—looks as if it could 
have been built in Italy. Other examples are 
purely American. We felt that our work 
should show both sides, the Italian and the 
American, and we therefore wanted to in-
clude the widest possible range of build-
ings in our survey. Accordingly, we chose 
to focus our attention on two urban cen-
ters, Helper, in Carbon County, Utah, and 
Eureka in Eureka County, Nevada, as well 
as several outlying farms in Carbon County 
and two ranches in Nevada known to be 
owned by Italian-Americans. The following 
illustrations were chosen to represent the 
Graduate School of Architecture's contribu-
tion to the Italian-Americans in the West 
Project. The drawings are by graduate stu-
dents Susan Anderson, Bee Bergold, Steve 
Simmons, and Doug Banks. Professor Darla 
Linberg-Berreth provided the artistic super-

built in two stages. The original dwelling was 
single-story in height and consisted of two

second story was 
added of brick rescued from the demolition of 
the Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad 
Company roundhouse in nearby Helper. In Italy 
two-level houses like this often had animals sta-
bled on the ground floor, and Manina perpetu-

a 
small donkey stall next to the kitchen. Draw-

The design of the house Joseph 
Delmue built in 1900 is that of the small three-
part villa. Such houses were popular with Eu-
rope's 
burgeoning middle-class during the nine-
teenth century. In choosing the villa form, 
Delmue made reference to a 
symbol of economic 
attainment familiar in his home country, al-
though the imposing stone building probably 
had the desired effect in Nevada as well. By the 
turn of the century, Joe Delmue was doing well 
in America and it showed in the kind of house 
he could afford to build. Sixteen years later, 
it showed in his barn too. Drawing by Doug

Milano had these stone houses built in 1911. 
They are single-story examples of the ubiquitous 
foursquare house type , 
a 
house type identified 
by its square,

of life for an Italian-American household. Draw-
