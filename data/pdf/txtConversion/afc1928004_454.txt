AUTHOR'S PREFACE. 
HARRIGAN & HART to the front again! and this time 
with the greatest of all hits. 
The Mulligan Guards, an 
organization of patriots called into the service 
of the 
American Public by the Great American 
humorists, de-
cided to give a 
Ball, which should be the - occasion of e 
joyful meeting of all their old friends and admirers. 
The Ball came off, and bas kept rolling on ever since, 
bidding fair to equal the great luminaries of the even-
ing sky. 
Rivalry—and no good thing ever starts with-
out it—set the Skidmore Guards on their metal and 
they started a 
ball at the same time and at the same 
place, but it fell through—fell through the 
ceiling-
and met a 
warm reception 
and as they were black 
guards, they were treated accordingly. 
The rollicking 
fun of this merry piece at the Opera Comique is 
too 
much for the brief space we. can allow for description, it 
must be seen to be at all appreciated.

So fresh we make with every pretty lass, 
On the cameria position.

Of girls we are so envious, 
When they take away our beaus, 
We could strike them oh! 'so real bard,

Den Mat your umbrellas high, 
De wind ain't gwine to blow. 
Hush your mouth when old folks talk 
Of eighty years ago, ago, ago. 
Dere was de Brittish army, 
We give ' em iron beans ; 
Wen we lay behind the cotton bales, 
Down in New Orleans, leans, leans. 
De colored troops fought nobly, 
De guns went al-a-ba-zarn, 
We knocked de dust plum off de heels, 
Of General Buckingham, ham, ham. 
Now, pi,y attention, children. 
And keep your shoestrings loose ; 
It's seldom that you ever hear 
A 
quack quack from a 
goose. 
We're just like old tough turkies, 
We sleep all day and night, 
We raise our feathers mountain high; 
When we start into fight.

Like Napoleon Bonyparte, 
And as he rides along the line. 
He'd break each lady's heart. 
And if the rain should fall down then, 
We hoist our umbrellas high, 
For history states that Irishmen. 
Are always warm and dry ; 
Then two by two away we go, 
Up Broadway through rain or snow, 
We'd face the devil, friend or foe, 
In the Patrick's day parade. 
We shout hurrah, etc. 
Then here's success to Patrick's day, 
Though it comes but once a 
year. 
And though I'm not a 
drinking man. 
On that day I 
d 
drink my beer; 
1'11 wear the shamrock in my hat, 
The green, my boys, ' twill never fade, 
And march along with Dan and Pat, 
In the Patrick's day parade ; 
Then two by two away we go, 
Up Broadway through rain and snow, 
We'd face the devil, friend or foe, 
In the Patrick's day parade.

She moves whin she's walking, 
She spikes whin she's talking ; 
An her petticoat is marked

On her cheek there's a 
dimple, 
On her nose there's a 
pimple , 
Her fut's very small— 
Sure she wears No. 10. 
She was the lady 
That fought Mrs. Brady, 
At home in Mayo 
She could whip all the men. 
Oh say, eta, 
She'd sing like a 
fairy, 
Or any canary, 
She never was standing 
Whinever she set. 
Like old Neptune's daughter 
She'd fall in the water, 
She'd come out like a 
herring, 
She'd never get wet. 
She was sober when drinking, 
When aslape she was thinking; 
She was delicate and soft 
As the wild buffalo; 
She'd a 
hand like a 
sailor 
On board of a 
whaler ; 
Her name is MeSwegati, 
From the county Mayo. 
Oh say, etc

\Via crave your condescension, and we'll tell you what 
we know 
Of marching in the Mulligan Guard from the Seventh 
Ward below; 
And our Captain's name was Hussey—a 
Tipperary man, 
lie carried his sword like the Russian Duke, whenever 
he took command. 
CHORUS. 
We shouldered guns and marched, and marched away 
From Jackson street way up to Avenue A, 
Drums and fifes did sweetly, sweetly play, as we march 
ed, marched, marched in the Mulligan Guard. 
When the band play'd Garryowen or the Connemarra 
pet, 
With the Rub, dub, dub, we marched in the mud— to 
the military step— 
With the green above the red, boys, to show 'Where we 
came from ; 
Our guns we'd lift with the right shoulder shift, 
As we marched to the beat of the drum. 
We shouldered, etc. 
When we get home at night, boys, the di,,11 a wink 
we'd sleep, 
We'd all set up and drink a 
sup of whisky, strong and 
sweet. 
Then we'd all march home together as slippery as lard; 
The solid men would all fall in, and march ill the Mul-
ligan Guard.

For Mary gives them all the proper steer.

When I

She is thoroughly conversant with the art of etiquette, 
And at cards she'd beat old Hoyle himself a

Oh, she'd dance you the mazourka, a

Reel or jig or shuffle in the sand, sehottishe or the Ger-

LITTLE MOUNTAIN DAISY. 
SONG AND DANCE. 
Words by FRANK DUMONT. 
Music by FRED TUTH1T1L 
Ix yonder little moss-grown cottage, 
Where beauteous daisies grow, 
A 
little blue-eyed darling's waiting 
With cheeks that are aglow; 
Like the blossom of the roses, 
Like aurora's brightest beam, 
Her image hauhts me night and day, 
In one long pleasant dream. 
Chorus. 
My love for her I 
must confess (
break), 
And ask the folks our love to bless, (
break), 
The wedding bells will sweetly chime, 
As hand in hand we stray, 
My mountain daisy will be mine 
Upon that happy day. 
We often talk about the future, 
Build castles in the air; 
I 
fancy that I 
rule a 
kingdom, 
And my little queen is there. 
But I'll ask for nothing more 
Than my darling's love so pure, 
It will outlaet all earthly wealth, 
And thro' this life endure. 
My love for her, c.c.

Sung by HARRIGAN & HART. 
THERE4S 
a 
bit of clay on a 
little stim, 
That's sweet enough to ate, 
Whin filled up wid tobacco 
'Twould put a 
man to slape. 
'Twas introduced in Ireland 
In the days of Brian Borhue, 
I'd rather lose my life, my boys, 
Than lose my honey•dew. 
Some call it Cavendish, 
Or any name you'd wish, 
And they dale it out in plug, you know. 
When it is fresh and green. 
When from my work I 
tire; 
I 
set down by the fire, 
An' I 
watch the smoke roll up and curl, 
From my little mild Duddeen. 
CHORUS. 
My duddeen you are so sweet to me, 
I 
love to see your smoke go up 
Whin I 
get through my tea; 
My duddeen, you are in the family. 
I'd surely die if I 
found out 
You were stole away from me. 
If ye studied history, 
Ye'll read where William Finn, 
Bought the state of Pinnsylvania 
From the wild red Injin men, 
He never used a 
sword or gun 
When he met them face to face, 
But they all sit down contiuted, 
And they smoked the pipe of peace. 
If ye'd only take a 
puff, 
Shure one would be enough 
To put you in a 
slumber, 
A 
stupor, or a 
drea:n. 
Ye might say it's not ginteel, 
But so beautiful I 
feel 
Whin I 
sit down in the corner, boys, 
Wid my little ould Ducldeen. 
My Ducldeen, etc. 
A 
Frenchman smokes the little thing 
They call the cigarette, 
It makes him feel uneasy, 
As he blows, and puffs, and frets; 
The Chinese smokes the opium, 
'Till it puts him in a 
doze. 
And the Yankee smokes the bad cigar, 
Wid one end to his nose, 
But every Irishman— 
Bould Patsey, Mike or Dan, 
That was born in dear old Ireland, 
Where the grasses grow so green, 
If they've no coat to their back; 
They've that bit of clay so black • 
It's a 
consolation to them, 
Is the little ould Duddeen.

But slightly elevated; 
With joy Fm overheated— 
I'm all broke up to-day. 
From Maloney's we went to Casey s— 
It was after twelve o'clock I 
We eat hot clams and fry's of lambs— 
Three barrels of saddle rocks 
Men from Tyrol and sweet Athlone, 
Across the Atlantic sea; 
Had arguments—of consequence 
I'm all broke up to-day. 
I 
had an altercation 
With Maloney's brother jack; 
We raFsell'd round the barrels— 
I 
put him on his back; 
Then the whole of Maloney's family 
Convey'd me to a 
dray, 
And took me to a 
Calaboose I 
I'm all broke up to clay. 
I 
have formed a 
resolution, 
The pledge I'm going to sign; 
Drink Ginger Ale and Double X 
Pale, 
And French Canandago wine. 
I'll sober up, and shake the cup, 
Drink sure, long, Coffee and Tea! 
I'll go home to bed and soak ray he. 
I'm all broke up to-day,

GRANDPA'S chair is vacant, 
Near the fire in the grate, 
Where he told his tales of boyhood— 
Kept the little ones awake; 
One eve, so worn and weary, 
Sleeping on his knee they lay, 
Death called that night—like the fire bright, 
Grandpa passed away. 
CHORUS. 
So let the room be cheerful— 
Place the old arm- chair 
Where we talked to grandpa, 
With his silv'ry snow-white hair; 
How he'd watch the falling ashes, 
And sadly meditate, 
Gently sigh, we all must die, 
Like the tire in the grate. 
One bitter niaht in winter, 
The snow fell fast, and wild; 
A 
girl looked in the window— 
A 
careworn, hapless child ; 
Then grandpa whispered, " Baby," 
And toddled to the gate, 
To save from sin he brought her in, 
Near the fire in the grate. 
So let the room be cheerful, ete, 
Keep the fire burning, 
'Tis charity's bright flame, 
Reminding of the evening 
The orphan Mary came, 
So ragged, cold, and hungry, 
With grandpa from the gate; 
For him she kneels, a 
pray'r she yields, 
Near the fire in the grate. 
So let the room be cheerful, etc.

great many inducements held out to 
de young men ob de present day, such as board- bills, right

De glue gave out, and I

OH, many moons have passed and gone, 
Since first I 
went to school, 
At Harvard, dear old Harvard, friends, 
I 
learned the Golden rule; 
My classmates scattered here and there, 
All trod their different ways, 
love to think and ponder o'er 
My youthful college days. 
(Repeat last two lines.) 
I 
remember when a 
Freshmen there; 
My age just twenty-four, 
In the Yale and Harvard races, 
I 
always rowed stroke oar; 
Our colors—handsome scarlet bright— 
First led the van always, 
Admired by the ladies all, 
Was I 
in college days. 
[Repeat last two lines.] 
Oh, the day -when I 
did graduate, 
I 
was my parent pride, 
Fitted for the bar or bench, 
A 
linguist, too. beside; 
Socially I'd always meet 
My colleagues bright and gay, 
And toss a 
merry social glass, 
To our commencement day. 
Repeat last two lines. 
Culture and intelligence, 
Are qualities quite fine, 
They help constitute the gentleman, 
In every worldly clime; 
You may crush them down unto the ground; 
With poverty's cold ways, 
They'll rise again, assert their claims, 
As taught in college days.

THREE years ago, this very day, we went to Governor's Isle, 
For to stand forninst the cannon, in true military style, 
Seventeen American dollars, each month we surely get, 
For to carry a 
gun and baganetts with a 
regimental step. 
We had our choice of going to the army or to jail ; 
Or it's up the Hudson River with a "copper" take a 
sail;! 
Oh, we puckered up our courage. wid bravery we did go, 
Oh, we cursed the day we went away wid the Regular Army.p. 
CHORUS. 
There was Sergeant John McCaffery, 
And Captain Donahne, 
Oh, they made us march and toe the mark 
In gallant company " Q." 
Oh, the drums would roll upon my soul, 
This is the style we'd go, 
Forty miles a 
day, on beans and hay, 
In the Regular Army 0. 
We wint to Arizony for to fight the Ingins there ; 
We came near being made bald headed, but they never got our 
hair; 
We lay among the ditches in the dirty yellow mud, 
And we never saw an onion, a 
turnip o: a 
spud, 
Continued. 
Oh, we were taken prisoners, conveyed forninst the chafe, 
Oh, he said we'll make an Irish stew, the dirty Indian thafe, 
On the telegraphic wire we walked to Mexico, 
We blessed the day we skipped away from the Regular Army 0. 
There was Sergeant, etc. 
We've been dry as army herengs, and as hungry as a 
Turk; 
Oh, the boys along the street cry out, " Soger, would you 
work ?" 
We'd ship into the Navy, for to plough the raging sea, 
But cold water sure, we couldn't endure, twould never agree 
wid me. 
We'll join the politicians, then we know we'll be well fed, 
Oh, we'll sleep no more upon the ground, but in a 
feather bed, 
And if a 
war it should break out, they call on us to go, 
We'll get Italian substitutes, for the Regular Army 0. 
There was Sergeant, etc.' 
We've corns upon our heels, my boys, and bunions on our toes, 
From lugging a 
gun in the red hot sun, puts freckles on our 
nose, 
England has its Grenadiers, France has its Zoozoos, 
The U. S. A., never changes they say ; but continually wear ' the 
blues. 
When we are out upon parade, we must have our muskets 
bright, 
Or they'll slap us in the guard-house to pass away the night, 
And whin we want a 
furlough, to the Colonel we do go; 
He says go to bed, and wait till you're dead, in the Regular 
Army 0!

Words by ED. 11.ARnioAN and sung by him in Ms beau-
tiful sketch of " The Blue and Gray." 
ON 
the banks of fhe Potomac, 
I 
am lonely here to-night; 
Sure I 
am waiting for the enemy, 
To come out here and fight; 
Arrah, when the war is over, 
Oh, I 
will bless the day, 
Let me be dead or living, 
I'd praise America. 
Bat sure I 
can't help thinking 
Of the girl I 
left behind, 
A 
rosy Irish lassie, 
So loving and so kind; 
My dear old grey-haired mother, 
I 
left there all alone, 
I'd feel like young Napoleon, 
When I'd go marching home. 
Oh, a 
soldier's life is tedious, 
When he's laying loose in camp, 
We never have excitement 
Unless we're on a 
tramp; 
A 
short life and a 
merry one, 
Is generally our lot. 
Till we get our life-long furlough, 
From the enemy's heavy shot 
If a 
soldier's never kilt, 
Oh, he's smothered up in luck, 
Should he lose an ear or finger, 
Or wid a 
bagnet struck; 
He can get a 
pair of crutches, 
From the doctor, it's well-known, 
And feel like the King of Persia, 
When he goes marching home. 
It's a 
pleasure to the soldier, 
To look up in the skies, 
And see the stars a-blinking, 
Like a 
pair of roguish eyes; 
A-winking and a-twinkling, 
Just as if they'd say— 
You may kiss me if you catch me, 
Before I 
get away. 
For to hear the wind a-howling 
And Moaning through the trees, 
It's enough to make you shiver, • 
And tremble in the knees; 
But I 
must do my duty, 
If I 
petrify to stone, 
I'll feel like Julius Ceasar, 
When I 
go marching home.,

A 
Humorous Recitation by En. HAILItIGAN 
Ci&r parch, I'll give it out straight, 
How I 
dropped down to a 
bum, 
Don't lay it altogether, rocks; 
On whisky, gin and rum, 
Put some of it to good nature, 
I 
was allus ripe and meller, 
I 
loved company, 'deed I 
did, 
They said I 
was a 
good feller. 
Have a 
ball, no nixey paths, 
I 
his't no more this year, 
Go in and get your load, 
But don't say I 
gave you a 
gear. 
I'm agin 'em shure, bet on me, 
On the avenue or in a 
cellar, 
I've drank enough to swim a 
ship, 
That's when I 
was a 
good feller. 
You're young, fresh, full of chin, 
You've got to keep up your lick, 
There's a 
way to get out of it 130011, 
There aint much need of a 
kick. 
Stay home and study figures, 
It's an old thing for me to bellow, 
Studying Hoyle wee solid for me, 
That's when I 
was a 
good follow;

A GOOD FELLOW. 
Continued. 
Mother's sick, ah, that's tough, 
You say you're her only kid, 
Don't use the old woman rough, 
Might get a 
stepmother instead. 
If you ain't flowing I'm lying, 
You start like a 
steam propeller, 
Boy, you'll do a 
heap of that crying. 
If you stick to being a 
good fellow. 
I've a 
few scads, aint on the borrow; 
I 
was broke, I 
struck the gang, 
They give me the old I'm sorry, 
That's charity done up in slang. 
They said that I 
was a 
good un, 
When a 
muss sprung up I'd quell her, 
My head been as big as a 
pudden, 
It come from being a 
good fellow. 
That's all the advice I'm giving, 
You take it, I 
don't want a 
sou, 
Save money, you'll get a 
living, 
Y'mus'nt mind what they say 'bout you. 
What, me ? I'll get long, don't wcrry 
I'm bran new like a

FRom mild Ireland I

And many's the shilling I've made, 
By sothlering ould kettles, ould boilers and pans, 
For tinkering sure is my trade ; 
At the break o' the day I

On no one but myself to depind, 
All round the city I'm crying, 
Any tinware to mend.

On Fifth Avenue I 
know all the Fervent gals. 
An' the many a

It's myself they call in to tinker the job, 
the boy that can stop up a

They give me a

Thin into the street I

Their heads are all our of the window, 
Whin there's any tinware to mend.

Ties her completely to me;

If I

That I'll not be ashamed to walk 'bout the streets 
Crying any tinware to mind.

Crying any tinware to mind.

With the neighbors they are friendly., 
They are their mother's joy; 
It's every summer evening, 
When the heat would make you droop; 
Friends they meet from every street 
To gossip on our front stoop. 
There's dainty Misses Grogan,

The undertaker Hogan. 
The pride of Calvary 
Such splendid vocalization, 
'Twould burst an opera troupe; 
The Sweet-By-and-By would make a
