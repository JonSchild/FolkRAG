" 
TAKE A CAR , 
YOUR HONOR ." 
Sung by J. D. KELLY. 
WILL you take a car, your honor, and I'll drive you to the 
" 
Sheds," 
The " Salmon Leap," the " Devil's Glen," the " Dargle;" or the 
" 
Beds ;" 
For mine's the only pony that can take you neat and fair, 
And tho' he's not a 
first-class horse he once kicked at the Lord 
Mayor. 
CHORUS. 
Then this way, your honor ; 
If you please, your honor, 
Will you take my jaunting car ? 
When you want a 
day's divarsion, you can find me on the stand, 
I'll drive you down to " Irish Town " to pick " cockles " in the 
sand ; 
I'll take you to the " Phcenix Park," to." Nancy Ann's," and 
then 
I'll drive to the Strawberry Beds, and back to town again. 
Then this way, etc. 
When you see the courting and the fun that's going on, 
You'd think a 
drive to Cullenswood was not ten perches long ; 
When he puts Ids arm around her waist, you're bursting to say, 
" 
Miss, 
Excuse me, but when the young man's done, might the driver 
take a kiss ?" 
Then this way, etc. 
Then jump into the car, sirs, and I'll drive you round the town, 
I'll show you the " Bank," the Monuments and places of renown, 
And when you come to settle up. I 
think you'll own for sure 
There never was a 
better horse to ride betind before. 
Then this way, etc,

BOLD JACK DONOHOE. 
Come all you true bred Irishmen, wherever you may be, 
Who'd scorn to wear a 
convict's chain, or live in slavery, 
Attention pay to what I 
say, and value it if you do 
Whilelate the matchless fate of bold Jack Donohoe.

1.1...-3IA RATH A BEAMING EYE. 
By TilostAs Moon. 
1.esbia bath a 
beaming eye, 
But no one knows for whom it beametb; 
Right and left its arrows fly, 
But what they aim at no one dreameth. 
Sweeter 'tis to gaze upon 
My Nora's lid that seldom rises; 
Few it looks, but every oue, 
Like unexpected light, surprises. 
Oh, my Nora Creina, dear, 
My gentle, bashful Nora Creina, 
Beauty lies 
In many eyes, 
But love in yours, my Nora Creina, 
Lesb'a wears a 
robe of gold, 
But all so close the nymph bath lac'd it, 
Not a 
charm of beauty's mould 
Presumes to stay where nature plac'd it. 
Oh, may Nora's gown for me, 
That floats as wild as mountain breezes, 
Leaving every beauty Iree 
To sink or swell as heaven pleases. 
Yes, my Nora Creiva, dear, 
My simple, graceful Nora Creina, 
Nature's dress 
Is loveliness— 
The dress you wear, my Nora Creina. 
Lesbia had a 
wit refined, 
But when its points ar_i gleaming round ua, 
Who can tell if they're design'd 
To dazzle merely, or to wound us ? 
Pillowed on toy Nora's heart 
In safer slumber Love reposes— 
Led of peace? whose roughest part 
is but the crumpling of the roses. 
Oh, my Nora Craina, dear, 
My mild, my artless Nora Creina, 
Wit, the' bright.

THE EXILE OF ERIN. 
There came to to the beach a 
poor exile of Erin. 
The dew on his robe was heavy tied cliii; 
For his country he sighed when at twilight repairing, 
To wander alone by the wind- beaten hill. 
But the day-star attracted his eyes's sad devotion: 
For, it rose on his own native isle of the ocean, 
1,V here once, in the flow of iris youthful en otion, 
He sang the bold Anthem of Erin go bragh. 
Oh! sad is my fate, said the heart-broken stranger, 
The wild deer and wolf to a 
covert can flee, 
But I 
have no refuge from famine or danger, 
A 
il3nre and a 
country renains not for me! 
Al ! never again, in the green shady bower 
Where my toreintLers lived, shall 1 
spend he swt et 1,011 n 
Or cover my harp with the wild-woven flowers, 
And strike the sweet numbors of Erin go bragh 
7 
Oh, Erin, my country! though sad and forsaken, 
In dreams I 
revisit thy sea-beaten shore ; 
But, alas ! in a 
far foreign land I 
awaken, 
And sigh for the friends that can meet me no more; 
And thou, cruel Fate ! wilt thou never replace me 
In a 
mansion of peace, where no perils can chase ins? 
Ah ! never again shall my brothers embrace me! 
They died to defend me, or live to deplore. 
("here now is my cabin-door, so fast by the wildwood ? 
Sisters and sire did weep for its fill. 
Where is the mother that looked on ray childhood ? 
And where is my bosom- friend — dearer than all ? 
Ah, my sad soul, long abandoned by pleasure 
Why did it doat on a 
fast-fading treasure? 
Tears, like the rain, may fall without measure, 
But rapture and beauty they cannot recall. 
But yet all its fond recollections suppressino, 
One dying wish my fond bosom shall draw; 
Erin, an Exile begnesths thee his blessing, 
Land of my foretath ,, rs, Erin go brag') I

PADDY IS THE 11014 
It's some years ago, I 
very well know, 
Since I 
first saw day-light with my two blessed eyearo 
was born, so they say, when nty Dad was away, 
(In St.. Patrick's day, in the morning. 
3.-low they nursed me with joy; said : what a 
fine lxiy: 
l'ut a 
stick in my fist, by the way of a 
toy; 
Faith! there's no mistake, they admired my make, 
And said some day I'd give the girls a 
warming. 
MMUS. 
For, Paddy is the boy that's fond of a 
glass, 
Paddy is the boy that's fond of a 
lass! 
Dear Old Dublin is the place for me, 
And Donnybrook is the place to go for a 
spre4. 
At a, wake or a 
fair, poor Paddy is there; 
He will fight foe or friend, if they do hint offend; 
Let the piper strike up, he will rise from his cup, 
With a 
smile on his face adorning. 
With his little Colleen, he'll dance on the green, 
Sure, an Irishman, there, in his glory was seen 
Play a 
reel or jig, he don't care a 
fig 
But he'll dance till day-light, in the morning. 
For, Paddy is the boy, (ku, 
Now- boys, do you mind; you never will find, 
Such a 
dear little place as the Emerald Isle; 
Long, long, may it stand, and good luck to the land, 
That dear Old St. Patrick was born in! 
May the girls, young and old, may the boys, brave. 
ni;.:

And, morn. noon and night, may joy and delight

NORA DARLING. 
Sung by SADIE M CGILL. 
I'm waiting alone by the stile, Nora darling, 
The place where you've met me so often before, 
And whispered so sweetly, " I 
love you, my Barney ;" 
Oh, why do you care, love, to greet me no more? 
Estranged from you life seems so bitter and lonely— 
Without your dear love, Nora darling, I'd die; 
I've wept for you oft since you left me in anger, 
Down here by the stile, without kissing good-bye. 
CHORUS. 
Forgive me and come back again to your Barney ; 
The angels will bless you, avourneen achree; 
Oh, dry those tears that forever are falling ; 
My Nora, my darling, oh, come back to me. 
Oh, have you forgotten your promise, mavourneen, 
You gave me the night when we met at the stream ? 
With your head on my bosom you told me you loved me; 
Then earth like a 
heaven to me, darling, did seem ; 
'Tis little I 
dreamed then of sorrow or sadness, 
Or felt in my heart that you'd break that fond vow; 
Another may win thee, but none in this wide world 
Can give you the love that I 
feel for you now. 
Forgive me, etc. 
The birds in the woodland sing sweetly as ever, 
The streamlet is flowing as placid and bright; 
My heart is as true to you, loving and yearning, 
And weeps for you, darling, both morning and night; 
Perhaps, when I'm gone, and the daisies bloom o'er me, 
You'll come in the twilight and weep o'er my grave, 
And mourn for the true heart that loved you so fondly, 
For one who'd have died you, sweet darling, to save. 
Forgive me, etc. 
THE SONG OP FIONNUALA.* 
BY 
Tom Mooan 
Am.—" Arra, my dear Eveleen." 
SILENT, oh Moyle, be the roar of thy water, 
Break not, ye breezes, your chain of repose, 
While murmuring mournfully, Lir's lonely daughter, 
Tells to the night- star her tale of woes. 
When shall the swan, her death- note singing, 
Sleep, with wings in darkness furl'd 
When will heaven, its sweet bells ringing, 
Call my spirit from this stormy world ? 
Sadly, oh Moyle, to thy winter- wave weeping, 
Fate bids me languish long ages away ; 
Yet still in her darkness doth Erin lie sleeping, 
Yet still cloth the pure light its dawning delay. 
When will that day- star mildly springing, 
Warm our isle with peace and love ? 
When will heaven, its sweet bells ringing, 
Call my spirit to the fields above ? 
ERIN 1 
THE TEAR AND THE SMILE IN THINE 
EYES. 
BY 
Tom M OORE. 
ERIN ! the tear and the smile in thine eyes 
Blend like the rainbow that hangs in thy skies ! 
Shining through sorrow's stream, 
Saddening through pleasure's beam, 
Thy sons, with doubtful gleam, 
Weep while they rise ! 
Erin ! thy silent tear never shall cease, 
Erin I 
thy languid smile ne'er shall increase, 
Till, like the rainbow's light, 
Thy various tints unite, 
And form, in Heaven's sight, 
One arch of peace ! 
* 
To make this story intelligible in a 
song, would require a 
much greater 
number of verses than any one is authorized to inflict upon an audience 
at once ; the reader must therefore be content to learn, in a 
note, that 
Fionnuala, the daughter of Lir, was by some supernatural power trans-
formed into a 
swan, and condemned to wander, for many hundred years, 
over certain lakes and rivers of Ireland, till the coming of Christianity; 
when the first sound of the mass-bell was to be the signal of her release. 
I 
found this fanciful fiction among some manuscript translations from the 
Irish, which were begun under the direction of that enlightened friend of 
Ireland, the late Countess of Moira.

THE HOPE AND 7TRIDE OF AN IRISHMAN 
AIR 
An Englishman." 
Elere's a 
stick that bears a 
well known name, 
And grew on a 
well known spot, 
By the powers who over tastes that same. 
Forget it they cannot; 
Its a 
freeborn Irishman by trade, 
The Shelalah called by name, 
It never yet a 
friend betrayed, 
And its foes well know its fame. 
CI-TORUS, 
The Shelalah's the sprig deny it who can, 
Its the hope and the pride of an Irishman. 
It always is the best of friends, 
When its on mischief bent ; 
It always gives whate'er it lends 
To their hearts' content: 
And he makes peace in a 
warlike way 
And when in love ' twill get, 
The Shelalah never runs away 
Without he pays his debt. 
The Shelalalfs, & c. 
Re's always at home, where 'er he'll go 
And ready to assist, 
To back his friends, he'll whack the foe 
Wid nort in his hand but his fist; 
It has a 
warm heart in light or dark, 
Yet full of Irish pride, 
t'ly the powers he's the very spark 
To warm the fireside. 
[Sx,A.ept) There aint much of you, my darlint old stick, hut 
yet there is a 
great deal of you for the little you are, arrah, faith 
von are a 
warm fellow so you are, didn't you warm Judy's Land-
lord by paying him the rent over the eyes and face? and didn't 
he give you a 
receipt by running away before you had settled 
the reckoning? arrah, and didn't you throw yourself on the fire 
to keep it in after it went out, to warm the dead body of poor 
Teddy Rowe? arrah sure you aint much of a 
schollard but thin'

THE RISING OF THE MOON. 
This song, which is the production of John B. Casey, " the 
Galtee Boy," who was an inmate of an English dungeon, is 
immensely popular here, especially in the West, where it is 
often made the marching tune of bodies of men eager to 
emulate the patriot example of the men of '98. 
It is sung to 
the Air of: " Wearing of the Green •," 
Oh then, tell me, Shane 0' Farrel, tell mewhere you hurry so? 
Huh, ma bouchal! hush and listen, and his cheeks were all 
aglow, 
I 
bear orders from the Captain: get you ready quick and soon 
For the pikes must be together by the risin' of the Moon. 
CHORUS. 
By the rising of the Moon, by the rising of the moon: 
For the pikes must be together by the risin' of the Moon, 
I 
bear orders from the Captain: get you ready quick and soon, 
For, the pikes must be together by the risin' of the Moon. 
Oh ! then, tell me, Shane 0' Farrell, where the gatherin' is to be ? 
' In the ould spot, by the river, right well-known to you and me. 
One word, more: for signal- token, whistle up the marchin' tune, 
With your pike upon your shoulder, by the risin' of the Moon. 
By the rising of the Moon, & e. 
Out from many a mud-wall cabin, eyes were watching_ thro' 
the night, 
Many a 
manly heart was throbbing for that blessed warning-
light; 
Murmurs passed along the valley, like the banshee's lonely 
Croon, 
And a 
thousand pikes were flashing by the rising of the Moon. 
By the rising of the Moon, &e. 
Down along you singing river, that dark mass of men was seen, 
High above their shining weapons floats their own beloved green, 
Death. to every foe and traitor! forward! strike the marehin' 
tune! 
And hurrah, my boys, for Freedom! ' tis the rising of the Moon 
'Tis the rising of the Moon, & c. 
Well they fon?,-lif for poor Ould Ireland, and full bitter was 
their fate; 
Oh! what glorious pride and sorrow fill the name of Ninety-
Eialt ! 
But yet, thank God, there's beating hearts in manhood'E, burn-
lug-noon, 
Who will folfo ,T 
in their footste-os hv the rising of the Moon.

T aE BARD OF ARMAGH. 
As sung by NED HAmtIGAN. 
t 
list to the lay of a 
po hr Irish harper, 
And scorn not the strains of his old withered hands, 
lint, remember those fingers, they once could move sharper; 
In raising the merry strains to his dear native land, 
It was long before the shamrock, dear isle, lovely emblem, 
Was crushed in its beauty, by the Saxon's lion paw, 
And all the pretty colleens around me would gather 
Call me their bold Phelim Brady, the Bard of Armagh. 
How I 
love to muse on the days of my boyhood, 
Though four score arid three years have flew by thorn, 
It's king's sweet reflection that every young joy, 
For the merry-hearted boys make the best of old men 
At a 
fah., or a 
wake I 
could twist my shillelah, 
And trip through a 
dance wid my brogues tied with straw 
There all the pretty maidens around me would gather, 
Coil in,: their bold Phelin) Brady, the Bard of Armagh. 
In truth I 
have wandered this wide world all over, 
Yet Ireland's my home and a 
dwaing for we, 
Awl oh, let the turf that my old bones shall cover, 
Be cut from the land that is trod by the free ; 
And when serjeant death in his cold arms cloth embrace. 
And lull inc to sleep with old Erin-go-bragh, 
the side of my Kathleen, my dear pride, oh place me, 
Then forget l'helim Bra y, the Bard of Armagh.

THE YOUNG MAY MOON. 
BY 
TOM MooRE. 
Am.- 4 The Dandy, 0." 
THE young May moon is beaming, love, 
The glow-worm's lamp is gleaming, love, 
flow sweet to rove 
Through Morna's grove,* 
When the drowsy world is dreaming, love! 
Then awake ! the heav'ns look bright, my dear ! 
'Tis never too late for delight, my dear! 
And the best of all ways, 
To lengthen our days, 
Is to steal a 
few hours from the night, my dear! 
Now all the world is sleeping, love, 
But the sage, his star-watch keeping, love, 
And I, whose star, 
More glorious far, 
Is the eye from that casement peeping, love. 
Then awake !—till rise of sun, my dear! 
The sage's glass we'll shun, my dear ! 
Or, in watching the flight 
Of bodies of light, 
lie might happen to take thee for one, my dear. 
' 
Steal silently to Morna's grove." 
Sec a 
translation from the Irish, 
in Mr. Bunting's collection, by John Brown, one of my earliest college 
companions and friends, whose death was as singularly melancholy and 
untovtunate as his life had been amiable, honorable, and exemplary.

FLY NOT YET , 'TIS JUST THE HOUR. 
BY TOM MOORE. 
Am.—" Planxty Kelly." 
FLY not yet, ' tis just the hour 
When pleasure, like the midnight flow'r, 
That scorns the eye of vulgar light, 
Boains to bloom for sons of night, 
And maids who love the moon : 
'Twas but to bless these hours of shade, 
That beauty and the moon were made ; 
'Tis then their soft attractions glowing, 
SA the tides and goblets flowing ; 
Oh ! stay— Oh ! stay— 
Joy so seldom weaves a 
chain 
Like this to-night, that, oh ! ' tis pain 
To break its links so soon. 
Fly not yet, the fount that play'd 
in times of old through Ammon's shade* 
Though icy cold by day it ran, 
Yet still, like souls of mirth began 
To burn when night was near ; 
And thus, should woman's heart and looks 
At noon be cold as winter brooks, 
Nor kindle, till the night returning, 
Brings their genial hour for burning ; 
Oh ! stay—Oh ! stay— 
When did morning ever break, 
And find such beaming eyes awake, 
As those that sparkle here 
4, Solis Fons, near the temple of Ammon.

But as we rode out together, the people cheered with joy, 
To see the Widow Machree from Ameriey, with 
the 
Roving Irish Boy, 
Crack, crack, dze. 
The next day I 
call'd to see her, and vow'd we ne'er should

To have the Widow Machree from Atnericy, with the

Oh, I

And many friends I've met; 
Not one fair scene or kindly smile 
Can this fond heart forget :

No more I 
wish to roam; 
Olt, steer my bark to Erin's Isle, 
For Erin is my home. 
Oh, steer my bat k,

But if Columbia were my home

Oh, steer my bark to Erin's Isle, 
For Erin is my home.

THE HARP 
THAT ONCE THRO' TARA's HALLS. 
The harp that once thro' Tara's halls 
Thu soul of music shed, 
Now hangs as mute on Tara's walls 
As if that soul had fled. 
So sleeps the pride of former days, 
So glo-y's thrill is o'er, 
And hearts that once beat high for pal- c, 
Now feel that pulse no more. 
No more to chiefs and ladies bright 
The harp of Tara swells; 
The cold alone, that breaks at night, 
its tale of ruin tells. 
Thus freedom now seldom wakes; 
The only throb it gives 
Is when some lyart indignant breaks 
To show that she still lives.

TEDDY McGANN. 
Written by J. D. KELLY. 
AS 
sung by BILLY COLLINS. 
My name is Teddy McGann—I 
drive a 
jaunting car, sirs— 
A 
jovial, true-born Irishman— I'm known both near and far, sirs, 
I'm happy and free from care, for nothing is me troublin' ; 
A 
better car or faster mare you will not find in Dublin. 
CI1011135. 
On my car I 
ride, both far and wide; 
I'm known and tried as an'Irish guide 
Thro' " Brake " and " Bog" and " Mireland," 
And all the while I 
drive each mile 
The girls all smile at the elegant style 
Of Teddy McGann of Ireland. 
To " Sandy Mount," or " Hill of Howth," or to the " Phcenix 
Park," sirs, 
Or any point east, west, or south, I 
drive each gay young spark, 
sirs ; 
I 
take my stand on Grafton street when I 
want a 
fare to find, 
sirs, 
And if on my car you take a 
seat, I'll drive you out of your 
minds, sirs. 
On my car I 
ride, etc. 
The ladies, miss or ma, there's one thing that they're wise in, 
Whene'er they want a 
jaunting car it's me they're patronizIn' ; 
I 
drive them with such ease, that go where'er they can, sirs, 
They never get a 
car to please like that of Teddy McG 
sirs. 
On ray car I 
ride, etc.

THE SONG OF O'RITARIC, 
PRINCE OF 
BREFFNI.* 
BY 
TOM MoonE. 
Am.—" The Pretty Girl Milking her Cow." 
THE valley lay smiling before me, 
Where lately I 
left her behind ; 
Yet I 
trembled and something hung o'er me, 
That sadden'd the joy of my mind. 
1 
looled for the lamp which she told me 
Should shine when her pilgrim return'd ; 
But though darkness began to enfold me, 
No lamp from the battlements burn'd. 
I 
flew to her chamber—'twas lonely 
As if the lov'd tenant lay dead— 
Ah, would it were death, and death only ! 
But no—the young false one had fled. 
And there hung the lute that could soften 
My very worst pains into bliss, 
While the hand that had waked it so often, 
Now throbb'd to my proud rival's kiss. 
There was a 
time, falsest of women, 
When B REFFNI'S good sword would have sought 
That man through a 
million of focmon, 
Who flared but to doubt thee in thought. 
While now—oh ! degenerate daughter 
Of Erin, how fall'n is thy fame ? 
Apd, through ages of bondage and slaughter, 
Thy country shall weep for thy shame. 
Already the curse is upon her, 
And strangers her valleys profane ; 
They come to divide—to dishonor, 
And tyrants they long will remain ! 
But, onward !—the green banner rearing, 
Go, flesh ey'ry sword to the hilt ; 
On our side is V IRTUE and E RIN, 
On their's is the SAXON and GUILT. 
These stanzas are founded upon an event of most melancholy import-
ance to Ireland; if, as no are told by our Dish historians, it gave England 
the first opportunity of dividing, concinerii-g, and enslaving us. 
The fol-
lowing are the eircumstanePs as related by O'Halloran. "'The 
of 
Leinster had long conceived a 
violent affection tor Dearbhorgil, daughter 
to the King of Meath, and though she had been for some time married to 
O'Ruark, Prince of Breffni, yet it could not restrain his passion. '1 
hey 
carried on a 
private correspondence, and she informed him that O'Ruark 
intended to go on a 
pilgrimage ( an act of piety frequent in those days), 
and conjured him to embrace that opportunity of conveying her from a 
husband she detested to a 
lover she adored. 
Maelforehad too ponetually 
obeyed the summons, and had the lady conveyed to his capital of Ferns." 
The monarch Roderic espoused the cause of O'Ituark ; while MacMurchad 
fled to England, and obtained the assiatance of Henry IL

Ant:—" The Wearing of the Green." 
Here's to all the boys of Ireland. wherever they may be, 
In Ulster Leinster. Conimught, from Blackwater TO the Lee. 
Here's to our gallant exiles, far front their native shore, 
Who sought to rend that cursed yoke, 
hieh 
0111' country sore, 
When our gallant Chief:3 Nv ere banded, and on the hills was seen 
Above them blitzed undying, sure, the Green, our holy Green. 
CHORUS. 
Then hurrah for old Erin, boys, hurrah ! hurrah! hnrrah ! 
Tim' she's now in Saxon bondage, and God send we'll see the day 
That sweet freedom will forever reign, and in her breastserene, 
And liberty the motto of our good old Flag of Green. 
Here's the mem'ry of young Emmet, Saysti eld,Wolf Tone,O'Pourke, 
St. Lawrence St. Patrick, not forgetting Edmund Burke, 
Joy, MacCracken. Napper Tandy, the Shearses and Jackson. 
Who died in famous '98 by the lilac k-heiirted Saxon. 
Ilere's to Davis, Moore and Curran. O'Connell, Swift— the. Dean, 
Who wrote and sung and pray'd, my bo s, for freedom to the Green. 
Then hurrah. Sz.e. 
TIreerli other nations claim the right of freedom's holy van, 
Let us prove we are no cowards, boys, and stand up to a 
man, 
Ti meet our country's f 
milieu, the Saxon, steel to steel ; 
1 
at our charge they scatter, boys, and back to hell they reel; 
w • barst our country's fett eta, and shine out in stately mien, 
With our ancient bauuer flying, boys, our own, our darling Green. 
Then hurrah, & c.

Tio .foisteen farm of Erin, and. the Sogarth of the dell, 
A 1 
with him here's to Jim Stephens, our patriot so great, 
Wao baffled England's devils, boys, in dreary Forty Eight. 
Then hurrah for old Erin, boys, hurrah ! hurrah ! hurrah 
11 trrah for gallant Stephens, and the Fenians of the day. 
And whou the conflict's over, may on the field be seen,

The pride of nations proudest. and the nearest of the dear.

Then success to our Colleens, boys, we'll toast with a 
hurrah,

cead nulle failthe we'll give them every day, 
how happy will we livt‘, boys, with out Colleens by our side, 
Our country free, and we agree, and peaceful in our pride. 
OUR IRISH LASSIES. 
Taken from GERALD GRIFFIN'S Works and Sung Iv J. 
H. 
RYAN, 
Here's to our Irish lassies. 
Where so ' ere their home; 
'Mid the ancient cities, 
Or where wild streams foam. 
For never hearts more constant, 
Nor eyes more bright; 
As such we pledge them fondly, 
On this festive night 
CHORUS. 
Here's to our Irish lassies, 
With their smiles divine; 
With drinkiug sparkling glasses. 
Of the rose red wine. 
Here's to all our lovely maidens, 
With their smiles divini
; 
"We drink in sparkling glasses, 
Of the rose red wine. 
All our lovely maidens, 
That charmed our sires of yore; 
Live and shine immortal, 
In wild Bardie lore. 
Still the same sweet faces, 
And their forms so fair; 
Blooms from Antrim's pillars, 
To the bright Kenmore. 
Here's to our, t 
a. 
it is true I've been a 
wanderer, 
O'er England's broad pl ai
ns; 
Through and through I've wandered, 
Scotland's wild domains. 
And here I 
have seen maidens, 
In the light of youth ; 
But not that Irish fondness; 
Nor that Irish truth. 
Denmark's maids are lovely, 
With their locks of gold; 
Spanish maids are stately. 
France 'lath charms 'untold. 
But that sweet bright beauty, 
Filling glance and smile; 
Dwells but with the maidens, 
Of the Emerald Isle. 
Here's to our, &e. 
Here's to our, &C. 
May they live forever, 
As in olden time : 
When brave warriors woo'd them, 
And sweet bards sublime. 
May their lovely faces, 
Shine for aye the same ; 
With that love-light beauty, 
Of love's radiant flame. 
Here's to our, eze.

DUBLIN CARMAN. 
ri7rry McCue, a 
boy so true, 
Il.elong to the Emerald Isle; 
You. attention I 
crave, and I'll chant you a 
stave. 
And perhaps it'll cause you to smile. 
I'm jolly and gay, the truth I 
say— 
And the girls both near and far, 
ears it's quite a 
thrate to take a 
sate, 
And a 
drive on my jaunting car. 
CHORUS. 
Driving, joulting, driving on a 
jaunting car, 
For when I 
get a 
fare, I 
drive away dull care. 
As I 
sit on my jaunting car; 
The reins I 
grip, and I 
crack my whip, 
And off goes my jaunting car. 
In Dublin town, of great renown,

Can grease the wheels of my jaunting car.

WHEN HE WHO ADORES THEE.

W HEN he, who adores thee,* has left but the name 
Of his fault and his sorrows behind, 
0 
say wilt though weep, when they darken the fame 
Of a 
life that for thee was resign'd ? 
Yes, weep, and however my foes may condemn, 
Thy tears shall efface their decree ; 
For Ileav'n can witness, though guilty to them, 
I 
have been but too faithful to thee ! 
With thee were the dreams of my earliest love ; 
Every thought of my reason was thine— 
. 
In my last humble prayer to the Spirit above, 
Thy name shall be mingled with mine 
Oh ! blest are the lovers and friends who shall live, 
The days of thy glory to see ; 
But the next dearest blessing that Heaven can give 
Is the pride of thus dying for thee. 
OH! HAD WE SOME BRIGHT LITTLE ISLE 
OF OUR OWN! 
By Tom Moonn. 
Am.—" Sheela Na Guira." 
OH 
I 
had we some bright little isle of our own, 
In a 
blue summer ocean, far off and alone ; 
IN here a 
leaf never dies in the still-blooming bow'rs. 
And the bee banquets on through a 
whole year of flow'rs; 
Where the sun loves to pause 
With so fond a 
delay, 
That the night only draws 
A 
thin veil o'er the day ; 
Where simply to feel that we breathe, that we live, 
Is worth the best joy that life elsewhere can give. 
There, with souls ever ardent and pure as the clime 
We should love as they lov'd in the first golden time ; 
The glow of the sunshine, the balm of the air 
Would steal to our hearts and make all summer there ! 
With affection as free 
From decline as the bowers ; 
And with hope, like the bee, 
Living always on flowers, 
Our life should resemble a 
long day of light, 
And our death come on, holy and calm as the night !

story in an old Irish manuscript, which is too

Although this heart was early blown, 
And fairest hands disturb'd the tree, 
They only shook some blossoms down, 
Its fruits has all been kept for thee. 
Then doubt me not—the season 
Is o'er, when folly made me rove, 
And now the vestal reason 
Shall watch the fire awak'd by love. 
And though my lute no longer 
May sing of passion's ardent spell, 
Oh ! trust me all the stronger 
I 
feel the bliss I 
do not tell. 
The bee through many a 
garden roves, 
And sings his lay of courtship o'er, 
But, when he finds the flower he loves, 
He settles there, and hums no more. 
Then doubt me not— the season 
Is o'er, when folly kept me free, 
And now the vestal reason 
Shall guard the flame awak'd by thee. 
AS A 
BEAM O'ER 
THE FACE OF THE 
WATERS. 
BY TOM M OORE. 
AIR.—" The Young Man's Dream." 
As a 
beam o'er the face of the waters may glow, 
While the tide runs in darkness and coldness below, 
So the cheek may be ting'd with a 
warm sunny smile, 
Though the cold heart to ruin runs darkly the while. 
One fatal remembrance, one sorrow that throws 
Its bleak shade alike o'er our joys and our woes ; 
To which life nothing darker or brighter can bring, 
For which joy has no balm and affliction no sting ! 
Oh ! this thought in the midst of enjoyment will stay, 
Like a 
dead leafless branch in the summer's bright ray ; 
The beams of the warm sun play round it in vain, 
It may smile in his light, but it blooms not again.

BRIAN THE BRAVE. 
REMEMBER the glories of Brian the Brave, 
Though the days of the hero are o'er, 
Though lost to Mononia, and cold in the grave, 
lie returns to K:nkorall no more! 
That star of the field which so often has poured 
Its beam on the battle, is set— 
But enough of its glory remains on each sword 
To light us to victory yet. 
Iononia ! when nature embellished the tint 
Of thy fields and thy mountain air so fair, 
Did she ever intend that a 
tyrant should print 
The footstep of slavery there ? 
No ! Freedom, whose smiles we shall never resigl, 
Go tell our invaders, the Danes, 
That ' tis sweeter to bleed for an age at thy shrine, 
Than to sleep but a 
moment in chains. 
Forget not our wounded companions who stood 
In the days of distress by our side : 
While the moss of the valley grew red with their blocd 
They stirred not, but conquered and died— 
The sun that now blesses our arms with his light, 
Saw them fall upon Ossory's plain ! 
Oh ! let him not blush, when he leaves us to-night, 
To find that they fell there in vain. 
GROVES OF BLA RNEY. 
AIR :—" The Last Rose of Summer." 
The groves of Blarney they are so charming, 
All by the purling of swate silent brooks, 
All decked with roses which spontaneous grow there, 
Planted in order by the swate rocky nooks. 
'Tis there the daisy and swate carnation, 
The blooming pink and the rose so fair, 
:Besides the lilly, and the daffy-down- dilly 
Flowers that scent the swate fragrant air. 
*Tis Lady Jeffers that owns this station, 
Like Alexander, or Queen Helen fair ; 
There's no commander throughout this nation 
For emulation can with ber compare. 
There's castles round her that no nine-pounder 
Could dare to plunder her place of strength; 
But Oliver Grimmer( he did her pummel!, 
And made a 
breach in her battlement. 
There's grand walks there for contemplation, 
And conversation in swate solitude: 
'us there the lover may hear the dove, or 
The gentle plover in the afternoon : 
And if a 
young lady should be so engaging, 
As for to take a 
walk in their shady bowers, 
'Tis there her courter, he might transport her 
To some dark fort or under ground. 
'Tis there's the cave where no daylight enters, 
But bats, rats, and badgers are forever bred, 
All decked by natur' which makes it swater 
Nor a 
coach and six. or a 
feather bed. 
'Tis there's the lakes that are stored with perches, 
And comely eels in the verdant mud, 
Besides the leeches, and the groves of beeches 
All standing in order to guard the flood. 
There is the stone that whoever kisses, 
He never misses to grow eloquent--
'Tis he may clamber to a 
lady's chamber, 
Or become a 
member of Parliament: 
A. clever spottier, he'll sure turn out, or 
" 
An out-and-outer' to be let alone; 
Don't hope to hinder him, or to bewilder him— 
Sure he's a 
Pilgrim from the Blarney Stone. 
'Tis there's the kitchen, hangs many a 
flitch in, 
With the maids a-stitching upon the stair; 
Och the bread and the biskie'. the beef and the whisky, 
Faith ! they'd make you frisky if you was but there. 
'Tis there you'd see Peg Murphy's daughter, 
A washing pratis foment the door, 
With Nancy Casey, and Aunt Delaney, 
All blood relations, to may Lord Donoughmore. 
There's statues gracing this noble place in, 
All heathen goddesses so fair; 
Bold Neptune, Plutarch, and Nicodemus, 
All mother-naked in the open air. 
So now to finish this brave narration, 
Which I 
have not the genii for to entwine, 
But were I 
Homer or Nebuchadneezar, 
'Tis in every feature that I'd make it shine, 
THE RIVAL DARKEYS.

OH! BREATHE NOT HIS NAME. 
By Tuokes MooRE. 
Oh! breathe not his name, let it sleep in the shade, 
Where cold and unhonored his relics are laid; 
Sad, silent, and dark be the tears that we shed, 
As the night-dew that falls on the grass o'er his head. 
But the night-dew that falls, though in silence it weeps, 
Shall brighten with verdure the grave where he sleeps; 
And the tear that we shed, though in secret it rolls, 
Shall long keep his memory green in our souls. 
THE IRISH DRAGOON 
By CHARLES LEVER, Esq. 
Ant :—" Sprig of Shillelab." 
Oh love is the soul of an Irish Dragoon, 
In battle, in bivouac, or in saloon— 
From the tip ot his spur to his bright sabre-tasche. 
With his soldierly gait and his bearing so high, 
his gay laughing look and his light speaking eye, 
Ile frowns at his rival, and ogles his wench, 
IIe springs on his saddle and chases the French— 
With his jingling spur and his bright sabre-tasche. 
His spirits are high, and he little knows care, 
Whether sipping his claret or charging a 
square— 
With his jingling spur and his bright sabre-tasche. 
As ready to sing or to skirmish lie's found, 
To lake off his wine or to take up his ground; 
When the bugle may call him how little he fears 
To charge forth in column and beat the Mounseers— 
With his jingling spur and his bright sabre-tasChe. 
When the battle is over he gaily rides back 
To cheer every soul in the night bivouac, 
With his jingling spur and his bright sabre-tasche. 
Oh, there you may see him in full glory crown'd 
And he sits 'mid his friends on the hardly won ground, 
And hear with what feeling the toast he will give 
As he drinks to the land where all Irishmen live— 
With his jingling spur and his bright sabre-tasche. 
ELLA REE. 
Oh, Ella Ree, so kind and true, 
In the little churchyard. lies, 
Her grave is bright with dreps af dew 
But brighter were her eyes.

There let me live and die, •

The summer moon will rise -and set, 
And the night-birds trill their lay, 
And the postim and coon so softly step, 
Round the grave of Dia. Ree.

THE MINSTREL BOY. 
The minstrel boy to the war is gone, 
In the ranks of death you'll find him ; 
His father's sword he's girded on, 
And the wild harp strung behind him. 
Land of song— said the warrior bard, 
Though all the world betray thee, 
One s
,, ord at least its right shall guard, 
One faithful harp shall praise thee. 
The minstrel fell, but the foeman's chains 
Could not keen his proud soul under; 
The liaip he loved ne'er spoke again, 
He tore the strings asunder ; 
And said : " 110 chains shall sully thee, 
Thou soul of love and bravery, 
Thy songs were made for the pure and free 
They shall never sound in slavery 1"

KILLARNEY.—[CoNcLunEn.1 
Innisfallen's ruined shrine 
May suggest a 
passing sigh; 
But man's faith can ne'er decline, 
Such God's wonders floating by. 
Castle Lough and Glena Bay, 
Mountains Tore and Eagles' Neat, 
Still at Mucross you must pray, 
Though the monks are now at rest. 
Angels wonder not that man 
There would fain prolong life's span 
Beauty's home, Killarney, 
Ever fair Killarney. 
No place else can charm the eye 
With such bright and varied tints, 
Every rock that you pass by, 
Verdure broiders or besprints ; 
Virgin there the green grass grows, 
Every morn spring's natal day, 
Bright-hued berries doff the snows, 
Smiling winter's frown away. 
Angels often pausing there, 
Doubt if Eden were more fair: 
Beauty's home, Killarney 
Ever fair Killarney. 
Music there for ea° dwells, 
Makes each sound a 
harmony, 
Many-voiced the chorus swells, 
Till it faints in ecstasy. 
With the charmful tints below 
Seems the heaven above to vie, 
All rich colors that we know, 
Tinge the cloud- wreaths in that sky, 
Wings of angels so might shine, 
Glancing back soft light divine: 
Beauty's home, Killarney, 
Ever fair Killarney.

WHEN THE LEAVES BEGAN TO FALL. 
As sung at the Howard Atherueum, Boston, Mass., by Messrs. Cor..LEss 
and OAKES. 
Mv song is of a 
little dark- eyed beauty, 
The fairest little flower of them all ; 
When first we met ' twas in this very city, 
'Twas early, when the leaves began to fall. 
With her eyes so bright, her step was so light, 
Her cheeks blushed like the rose ; 
Oh how I 
loved this idol of my heart, 
Indeed you can suppose. 
CHORUS. 
Form and feature she's so sweet, 
Slender waist and Cinderella feet; 
Oh I 
confess I 
love this little dark-eyed beauty, 
The fairest little flower of them all ; 
When first we met ' twas in this very city, 
'Twas early, when the 'Nixes began to fall. 
When I 
met her first, 'twas out upon a 
pic-nic, 
I 
never shall forget her winning smile ; 
Though she danced and made the changes with the music 
With her graceful, fascinating little smile ; 
I 
saw her home, I 
asked her for a 
kiss, 
My heart was all aglow, 
She hung her head and blushed so deep, 
And simply answered, " no."

KELLY TOOLE, OF VTR COUNTY OF WICK-
LOW. 
Did sou split the pitcher ?." 
Ould Erin has cities for girls that are pretty, 
And wen the world knows that is true, sirs ; 
For since Eve was a 
maid in the garden of Eden, 
To our beauties no one dare say " boo," sirs; 
Though with joy I 
appear, I'm beat down with despair— 
My heart is so sore it is making me speak low,— 
And I'll tell you, by gorra! the cause of my sorrow, 
Is Nelly Toole, of the County of Wicklow. 
Spoken.—Yes, Nelly, you are the craythur that is making 
me sup sorrow ; aye, and ate it too ; troth, I'm afraid I'll 
he choked with the same feed. 
The first time I 
had the 
pleasure of disearning her was at the wake of Garret 
Byrne ( rest his soul !) as gay a 
boy as ever got a 
head ; and 
Nelly was the real specimen of a 
puny girl. 
The first 
glance I 
got of her I 
was taken on a-wares— as the delph-

NELLY TOOLE, OF THE COUNTY OF WICK-
LOW.—[CONCLUDED. 
If you're satisfied, 
To be made a 
bride 
In the beautiful County of Wicklow. 
I 
watched all along how she sneered at my song, 
And my blood with vexation soon rose, sirs ; 
And an odd eye or two in the corner she threw 
To a 
chap they called " Bounce-about Keogh," sirs. 
He was straight, tall, and full, had a 
neck like a 
bull, 
And a 
collar-and- elbow your shins he could tickle; 
In a 
ring at the fair, neither Meath nor Kildare 
Could conquer this divil in Wicklow.

course, when I 
finished my verse, I 
threw an 
°filar into the corner, and there I 
sees my bully botild 
Keogh. Oh I 
by the contents of the blanket, and that's a 
woolly and lively oath, I 
thought he was the hippotimus

dozen youngsters who 
were playing the

rowled the fiddler like an apers e

" 
you're welcome ould stock." " Nabocklish," says Hoppy, 
that means thank ye,— when he seen the wrestler and ould 
Toole discoorsing. " Arrah, Bully Keogh," says he, " if 
von can't get your opportunity to chirrup with the chicken 
don't let the ould cock pass you." 
Keogh called on Hoppy 
for a 
song; he sung a 
rale good one. 
But nothing would 
do but that I 
should sing—

NORAH DIALOY. 
Ant :—" Wishing Gate." 
One fine summer's day, in the night rather late, 
Paddy Flinn had sneaked off to the old wishing gate, 
To just try his hand at a 
sort of a 
spell, 
About things that his auld mother used for to tell ; 
That fairies and conjurers squatted down there, 
To give phat folks ax'd at that time of the year. 
So Paddy went there just his hick for to try, 
And he wished for a 
pig to put into his sty ; 
But wait awhile yet as the truth I 
relate, 
Phat happened to Pat at the wishing gate. 
(Spoken)—Och sure, Paddy was a 
good boy enough, if he 
had not been such a 
bad one; and, sure, mighty fond of 
me he was. 
Och! sure he fell in love wid me before he 
saw me. 
Och ! faith, that's true for me, so it is; for he 
was after telling me widout speaking a 
word of mouth 
but, och! faith it was by word of eye he was after telling 
me. He was born at Kilkenny; but sure he was such a 
roving blade, that he run away from home before he could 
walk. 
But wait awhile ago till Pse tell yez how the wish-
ing gate was after sarving him. 
" 
I 
wish for," says Pat, as the gate he did stride, 
4
4 As I've got but one pig, just another beside ; 
And I 
wish for some praitius, the pigs for to fade; 
And I 
wish they might brade, and knock up a 
good trade, 
I'd then buy some poultry, ducks and a 
cow, 
pi 
45 
NORAH INICALOY—[CoNcLuDED. 
And a 
thumping shillelah,to kick up a 
row ; 
And then I 
cud get me a 
handsome young bride, 
And bogtrotting Katty (Spokoz—That's me) I'd then push 
aside." 
But little did Pat know he was overheard, 
But, faith, I 
was there, and sucked in every word. 
(Slyok,en)—Och! bad luck to yez, Paddy, says I, you 
desaver ; but not a 
word did I 
spake. 
Sure is this the way 
you are true-hearted by your falsehood ? 
And every word 
of truth you told me was a 
lie. 
Well, I 
kept on talking 
widout saying a 
word. 
So away went Paddy on first and 
I 
before him, crying fit to break the heart of me widout 
shedding a 
tear. 
So up he goes to the pig-sty to see had 
he got the other pig. 
Och ! by the faith of me, the only 
pig he had left was gone, and had run away wid the prude 
garden in his pocket. 
Arrah, Paddy, says I, phat's this you 
have been after wishing? Where are the pigs you arn't 
got? 
Where's the policy that's not born too ? 
Where's 
your poultry and ducks ? 
Faith you are after looking like 
a 
goose ! 
Where's the cow you was after axing the wish-
ing gate for ? 
Sure and that cow's a 
bull ! 
And faith and 
troth. where is myself, the bogtrotter, that you will dis-
charge before you have me ; and where's the shillelah, the 
shillelah that you are going to kick up a 
row wid? 
Arrah, 
faith and sure, here's that same tin, cried Jerry Donovan ; 
and faith, Paddy, I'll be after giving you phat you have 
been axing for—so I 
will. 
So Jerry hit on to Pat, and rat 
fell to tearing all the bald hair off his head—for the fairy 
hind made an old man of him, though he was only twenty. 
lie got blind of both legs, lame of both eyes, his elbows 
down at heels, and his heels out at elbows ; so I 
hope 
it will be a 
warning to all greedy folks, and teach us to be 
contented wid what we have, whether we have got it or

MOLLY ASTORE.

[Mr. °Gut represented the City of Dublin in 1799, and voted against 
the " Union." He lived to see that vile measure realize Dr. JonNsoN's 
prophetic words to an Irish gentleman—" Don't unite with us, sir, 
or we'll rob you." This sweet song is supposed to have been address-
ed to the lady to whom he was afterwards married.] 
As down by Banna's banks I 
strayed, 
One evening in May, 
The little birds. in blithest notes, 
Made vocal ev .ry spray; 
They sang their little notes of love, 
They sang them o'er and o'er, 
Alt ! Gra ma chree ma colleen oge, 
Ma Molly Astore. 
The daisy pied, and all the sweets 
The dawn of Nature yields— 
The primrose pale, and vi'let blue, 
Lay scattered o'er the fields ; 
Such fragrance in the bosom lies 
Of her whom I 
adore. 
Al) ! Gra ma, tic. 
I 
laid me down upon a 
bank, 
Bewailing my sad fate, 
That doom'd me thus the slave of love, 
And cruel Molly's hate ; 
How can she break the honest heart 
That wears her in its core?

You said you lov'd me, Molly dear

Nay, heaven could give no more.

Oh ! had I

Denotes from the stalk we together should toil, 
And ourselves by ourselves be befriended. 
And still thro' the bog, thro' the brake, and the mireland, 
From one root should branch like the Shamrock of Ireland 
The dear little Shamrock, the sweet little Shamrock, 
The dear little, sweet little Shamrock of Ireland.

And while you sleep, the flow'rets weep,

But better there her beauties bear 
For thou her beams would shade, love. 
Och I

The stars look cold and blue, love: 
Their twinkling rays have come to gaze,

The perfume that lies there, love.

WEDDING OF BIDDY M'GRANE. 
I'LL sing you a 
song if you'll listen awhile, 
Of a 
damsel so pretty, so charming, and witty, 
Who liv'd from the city of Dublin a 
mile, 
On the road to Clondalk, in the Emerald Isle ; 
Don't think for a 
moment l'm tipping the blarney, 
But search near and far and you might search in vain, 
From Donaghadee, to the banks of Killarney, 
And not find the equal of Biddy M'Grane. 
A 
fine hearted genuine son of the soil, 
One Larry Molloy, a 
broth of a 
boy, 
Who knew what it was for his living to toil, 
On a 
neat bit of land of his own at Baldoyle ; 
And Larry for marriage felt no inclination, 
But love is a 
thing that ye cannot explain, 
And enters your heart without hesitation, 
So Larry was smitten with Biddy M'Grane. 
Now Larry was fond of a 
jig, the spalpeen, 
He went to the fair and Biddy was there, 
And strolling up to the pretty Colleen. 
Soon led her out for a 
dance on the green ; 
The blink of her eye was near driving him crazy, 
lie axed her consent but she looked with disdain, 
But when the bold Larry, he trampled the daisy, 
It melted the heart of Biddy M'Grane. 
WEDDING OF BIDDY M'GRANE.—Continued. 
The day of the wedding the girls and the boys, 
And friends were invited, and highly delighted, 
The Lannigans, the Brannans, the Burkes, and Molloys, 
Were all in their glory, with fun and with noise ; 
Miss Morgan she came along with Dan Brady, 
In a 
new suit he'd brought from ould Petticoat Lane, 
And Larry M'Guiness arrived with Miss Grady, 
To dance at the wedding of Biddy M'Grane. 
The feasting indeed it was mighty fine, 
There was bacon and cheese, potatoes and peas, 
And lashings of potheen, in place of the wine; 
Biddy she look'cl like a 
goddess divine, 
Attired as she was in her gorgeous apparel, 
In a 
new yellow kirtle of muslin de laine. 
Ould Barney the fiddler on top of a 
barrel, 
Struck up " Garryowen " for Biddy M'Grane. 
The feasting concluded the dancing began, 
The Cairns and the Gilligans, and the O'Howlagans, 
All of them leaped to there feet, to a 
man, 
And jigged it as only Irishmen can : 
But when bould Jemmy Howlagan leaped on the table, 
I 
suppose ' twas the whiskey that fired his brain, 
And roared, ' Cead mille Faltaigh " as long as he was able, 
Good luck and more power to Biddy M'G.-ane.

I'M LEAVING THEE, ERIN. 
By HARRY MA.CARTLIY. 
I'm leaving thee, Erin, dear land of my birth, 
The brightest—the fairest green spot on the earth, 
I'll never forget thee where'er I 
may roam, 
My clear cherished country, my forefather's home. 
CHORUS. 
Erin we'll see, dear Erin we'll see, 
Thy green flag in freedom float joyous and free. 
(Repeat.) 
The heel of oppression has left its dark stain, 
On Erin's green shamrock that grew on the plain, 
I'll never forget the brave heroes of old, 
That reigned ere my country was bartered for gold. 
Erin well see, etc. 
The dear little colleen that oave me her heart, 
Has kissed me farewell and now bids me depart, 
ni never forget as I 
plough the salt Fea, 
That I 
yet may return rto set Edo free. 
Erin we'll see ; etc. 
So steer there my bark for that dear happy land— 
Columbia, where Irishmen join heart and hand, 
And swear by their honor the world shall yet see, 
The green flag above the red joyous and free.

The ladies' hearts I 
captivate as for them my stick I 
twirl, 
But, gramachree, the maid for me is Kitty, the Wicklow Girl. 
CHORUS. 
For her neck is white and her step is light, and her teeth are 
like the pearl, 
There is none so gay by night or day, as Kitty, the Wicklow 
Girl. 
Her fortune, faith, it is hut small, to him who wins her hand, 
But her heart is pure, and that's worth all the diamonds in 
the land ; 
If my pockets they were lined with gold, like any great lord 
or earl, 
Arrah, boys, I'm sure I'd still be poor without my Wicklow 
Girl. 
For her neck, etc. 
Yees may talk about fandangos that the ladies hop in France, 
But let them go to Wicklow, and there they tiee a

LET ERIN REMEMBER THE DAYS OF OLD. 
BY 
Tom -
Moor.c. 
Ain.—" The Red Fox." 
LET Erin remember the days of old, 
Ere her faithless sons betray d 
her; 
When Malachi wore a 
collar of gold ;* 
Which he won from her, proud invader, 
When her kings, with standard of green unfurl'd, 
Led the Red- Branch Knights to danger, 
Ere the emerald gem of the western world 
Was set in the crown of a 
stranger. 
Lough Neagh's bank t 
as the fisherman strays, 
When the clear, cold eve's declining, 
He sees the round towers of other days 
In the wave beneath him shining ; 
Thus shall memory often, in dreams sublime, 
Catch a 
glimpse of the days that are over; 
Thus, sighing, look through the waves of time 
For the long faded glories they cover. 
* " This brought on an en.c'ounter between Malachi ( the monarch of Ire-
land in the tenth century) and the Danes, in which Malachi defeated two 
of their champions, whom he encountered successively, hand to hand, tak-
ing a 
collar of gold from the neck of one, and carrying off the sword of the 
other, as trophies of his victory."— Warner's History of Ireland, Vol. I.,

t " Military orders of knights were very early established in Ireland ; 
long before the birth of Christ we find a

Branch,' from their chief seat in Emania, adjoining to the palace of the 
Ulster kings, called Teagh na Cra.oibhe ruatin, or the Academy of the Red 
Branch ;" and contiguous to which was a large hospital, founded for the 
sick knights and soldiers, called Bron-bheare, or the House of the Sorrow-
ful Soldier.' "— allalloran's Introduction, etc., Part I., Chap. 5.

RICH AND RARE WERE THE GEMS SHE WORE 
By 
THOMAS MOORE. 
:Rich and rare were the gems she wore, 
And a 
bright gold ring on her wand she bore ; 
But oh ! her beauty was fitr beyond 
her sparkling gems, or snow-white wand. 
"Lady ! dost thou not fear to stray 
So lone anti lovely through this bleak way ? 
Are Erin's sons so good or so cold, 
As not to be tempted by woman or gold ?" 
" 
Sir Knight! I 
feel not the least alarm, 
NO son of Erin will offer me harm 
For. though they love woman and golden store, 
Sir Knight ! they love honor and virtue more." 
On she went, and her maiden smile 
in safety lighted her round time green isle ; 
And blest forever is she who relied 
Upon Erin's honor, and Erin's pride.

As I

Like Romulus or Julius Caysar, 
With the best of fine victuals to eat, 
And drink like great .Nebuchadnezzar, 
A rasher of bacon I'd have, 
And potatoes the finest was seen, sir ; 
And for drink, it's no claret I'd crave, 
But a 
keg of ould Mullen's potted, sir, 
With tue smell of the smoke on it still. 
They talk of the Romans of ould, 
Whom they say in their own times was ftisky ; 
But trust me to keep out the cowld, 
The Roman's at home here like whisky. 
Sure it warms both the head and the heart, 
It's the soul of all readin' and writin' ; 
It teaches both science and art. 
And disposes for love or for fightin'. 
Oh, potteen, good luck to ye, dear.

MEETING OF THE WATERS. 
There ls not in the wide world a 
valley so sweet 
As that vale in whose bosom the bright waters meet ; 
Oil! the last ray of feeling and life must depart, 
Ere the bloom of that valley shall fade from my heart. , 
Yet it was not that nature had shed o'er the scene 
Her purest of crystal and brightest of green ; 
'Twos not the soft magic of streamlet or hill— 
! 
no— it was something more exquisite still. 
'T was that friends the beloved of my bosom were near, 
Who made every dear scene of enchantment more dear, 
And who felt how the best charms of nature improve, 
When we see them reflected from looks that we love.. 
Sweet vale of Avoca I 
how calm could I 
rest 
In thy bosom of shade, with the friends I 
love best, 
Where the storms that we feel iu this cold world should cease, 
tirld our hearts, like thy' waters, be mingled in peace. 
REVERVCRPR TREE. 
Remember thee! yes, while there's life in this heart, 
It shall never forget thee, all lorn as thou art ; 
More dear in thy sorrow, thy gloom, and thy showers, 
Than the rest of the world in their sunniest / tours. 
Wert thou all that I 
wish thee,—great, glorious, nu 
el free--
First flower of the earth and first gem of the sea.— 
I 
might hail thee with prouder, with happier brow, 
But, oh I 
could I 
love thee more deeply than now ? 
No, thy chains as they rankle, thy blood as it runs, 
But make thee more painfully dear to thy sons— 
Whose hearts, like the young of the desert-bird's nest, 
Drink love in each life-drop that flows from thy breast !

What would you Jo, love, when I 
am going, 
With white sails flowing the seas beyond, 
What will you do, love, when waves divide 11L, 
And friends may chide us lot being fond ? 
Tho' waves divide us and friends be chiding. 
In faith abiding I'll still be true, 
And I'll pray for thee on the sto. ,'ocean, 
In deep devotion—that's what I'll (lo. 
What would you do, love, if distant tidings,. 
Thy fond confidings should undermine, 
And I 
abiding 'neath sultry skies, 
Should think other eyes were as bright as thine? 
Oh I 
name it not 1—tho' guilt and shame 
Were on thy name—I'd still be true I 
But that heart of thine should another share it, 
I 
could not bear it—what would I ? 
What would you do, love, when home returning, 
With hopes high burning, with wealth for you, 
If my bark which bounded o'er foreign foam. 
Should be lost near home—oh! what would you do 
So thou wert spared, I'd bless the morrow, 
In want and sorrow, that left me you! 
And I'd welcome thee from the wasting billow, 
This heart thy pillow—that's what I'd do I 
Oh I 
good evening, gentlemen, to-day— 
Now list awhile to me and my blarney. 
I 
am arrived from Dublin quay, 
Now sure my name is Michael Karney. 
Grub was scarce and luck was bad, 
Hunger's rumbling ne'er did cease, man, 
So to this city I 
came 'egad, 
And Murphy's made me a 
new policeman. 
CHORUS. 
Ranting, rollicking Irish joys, 
Always quarreling, ne:er at peace, man; 
Kissing the girls and licking the boys, 
Oh 1 
that's the life of a 
new policeman. 
Och ! there isn't yard or garden wall, 
About the city but I 
can scale it, 
And if anything I 
find at all, 
Now shouldn't I 
fool be not to nail it ? 
Next morning there's a 
hue and cry ; 
There's something stolen, and to be brief, man. 
Oh 1 
by the hookey, who but I 
Am running about to catch the thief, man. 
Ranting, rollicking, & c, 
And then, you know, when I'm out at night 
In every hole and corner peeping, 
What's that I 
spy by the pale moonlight, 
°eh! by my soul, ' tis a 
gentleman sleeping. 
His pockets I 
grope and his money I 
take, 
And then with my staff in the ribs I 
am jobbing him, 
And if by chance the man should wake, 
I 
tell him I 
thought a 
thief was robbing him. 
Ranting, rollicking, & c. 
Then if there isn't a 
row in the street. 
Sure it's myself knows how to raise one. 
For. I 
knock the first man down I 
meet, 
Then make a 
shindy fit to craze one. 
He resists, then loud he hollers, 
I 
lock him up and swear he's rioty. 
Next morning he is fined two dollars, 
Just because myself couldn't murder him quietly. 
Ranting, rollicking, & c.
