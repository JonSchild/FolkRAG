Interviewer, Aaron Paige and Elinor Levy  
Conducted on May 27, 2022 
Interview conducted at the Alamo Community Center, Goshen, NY.  
Aaron Paige (00:00): 
Today is Friday, May 27th, 2022. My name is Aaron Paige. Spelling, A A R O N. Last name Paige, P A I G E. 
And I'm here today with fellow interviewer and folklorist, Elinor Levy, spelled E L I N O R. Last name L E V 
Y. Today, Elinor and I will be interviewing Yaneli Gutierrez as part of the Archie Green Fellowship Project 
titled "Community Health Workers in Downstate New York." Yaneli, would you please state and spell 
your full name? 
Yaneli Gutierrez (00:35): 
Okay. My name is Yaneli Gutierrez, Y A N E L I G U T I E R R E Z. And I'm very glad to be part of this 
interview. So I'm ready. 
Elinor Levy (00:48): 
Thank you. What is your official title here at Sun River? 
Yaneli Gutierrez (00:51): 
I am a Community Health Worker and a Patient Representative at Sun River too. So I do both of them. 
Aaron Paige (00:59): 
What year were you born, and where were you born and grew up? 
Yaneli Gutierrez (01:04): 
I was born in 2003. I was born in Middletown, in this old hospital that's a college now for nursing. I grew 
up in Pine Island. My parents at the time, they were farm workers too. So I kind of got to experience all 
that. See how they make money through the farms, all that. Doing this job helps me understand people 
more, considering that I went through it with my parents, because my parents did all that too. So, yeah. 
Elinor Levy (01:42): 
And where were your parents born? 
Speaker 2 (01:44): 
They're from Mexico, in the small town named Jalisco. 
Elinor Levy (01:49): 
So the state of Jalisco? 
Yaneli Gutierrez (01:51): 
Yeah. 
Aaron Paige (01:53): 
And when did they come to the United States? 
Yaneli Gutierrez (01:57): 
They came 20 years ago. It was when my brother was born. They came and then they had to work a lot. 
So they sent my brother to Mexico with my grandma for a bit. They made money working in the fields, 
and then they brought my brother back and then I was born. Then from there, they just continued giving 
us a better life there. 
Elinor Levy (02:20): 
Do they still work the farms? 
Yaneli Gutierrez (02:23): 
No. My mom and dad works in an onion field now. Not a field. It's like a factory, kind of. 
Elinor Levy (02:33): 
Mm-hmm. 
Yaneli Gutierrez (02:33): 
My dad has been working there for 10 years now. 
Elinor Levy (02:38): 
And is that near here, because of the black dirt? 
Yaneli Gutierrez (02:42): 
Yeah. It's like two minutes away. 
Aaron Paige (02:47): 
Were your parents working as farm workers before they came to the United States? 
Yaneli Gutierrez (02:53): 
No, they came here and they started working the fields, and then from there they just kept looking for 
more jobs. My mom, for some time, she worked at a preschool, Florida ABCD, and then she started 
working with my dad. So they've been working there, but yeah. They were farm workers for years. Yeah. 
Elinor Levy (03:20): 
How did you, because you're young still, so how did you decide that you wanted to be a community 
health worker? 
Yaneli Gutierrez (03:31): 
I decided I wanted to be one because I've seen the struggles of people. I grew up into that. I know how it 
is. So if I can help people by being a community health worker, and explaining to them how my life was 
with my parents, and I know how it feels and explaining to them, the safeties and the dangers of, you 
know, stuff like that. I'd be glad to help them with that. So yeah. 
Aaron Paige (04:02): 
What are some of the main challenges that you saw growing up that you wanted to help people get 
through? 
Yaneli Gutierrez (04:16): 
I think it was more my parents having to work late-night, to the point where I would barely see them, 
because they were working to make sure me and my brothers were okay. I just want to talk to the 
parents on how maybe their kids feel too. But also how if they work late-night or are around stuff like 
that to maybe not go in with their young children in there for safety, because they could get sick with all 
that. 
Aaron Paige (04:59): 
Mm-hmm. 
Yaneli Gutierrez (05:00): 
And we also talk about safety in the house, which is very important too, because people work in the 
farmworker places, and sometimes they can bring in germs. So we talk about that too. So we help them. 
We also give them little handbags that have things in there that will be helpful for them. So it's pretty 
cool. 
Aaron Paige (05:25): 
Was this child safety initiative a project that you yourself started, or that you joined? 
Yaneli Gutierrez (05:33): 
I joined it because I wanted to be part of it, considering that I was once understanding that. So me 
learning about it, we have trainings every Sunday too. Like we keep learning about it and learning about 
it. It's something I wanted to do to understand more and to hear people's stories too. 
Aaron Paige (05:54): 
Mm-hmm. 
Yaneli Gutierrez (05:54): 
Because sometimes we go there, they tell us where they're from, how they came here. So yeah, it's 
interesting. 
Elinor Levy (06:01): 
So sometimes parents will have to take their children with them? 
Yaneli Gutierrez (06:06): 
Yes. Sometimes parents don't have someone to babysit their kids, so they have no choice and to take 
them to work. I myself used to go to my parents' job and just stay in the car, waiting for them because 
they didn't have a babysitter. So yeah, I understood that. 
Aaron Paige (06:25): 
Is it common for parents or guardians to also bring their children into the workplace itself? 
Yaneli Gutierrez (06:34): 
Yeah. A lot usually do bring their kids in because, as I said, they don't have babysitters. Sometimes they 
even tell them, "Oh, you should work with me, make some money." If, they start off young. Sometimes I 
would work with my parents. I was five and I didn't know what to do, but they just told me to do. They 
would give me money and, you know, they'd be like we'll get you you ice cream and pizza at the end. 
You know? But after all that, I understood. They did it for me to have values, for me to understand 
where money comes from. They were always like, "If you don't want this life, try to better yourself, try 
to graduate, do this, do that." You know? 
Elinor Levy (07:20): 
Is there any, I'm just curious, you know, because that's a huge safety risk for the owners and none of the 
owners thought, "Wow, maybe if we had a daycare or a night care?" Or you know? 
Yaneli Gutierrez (07:33): 
Yeah. In the summer we do have a little summer program for the farmworker kids while their parents 
are at work. We take care of them from nine o'clock to five. Because around that time the parents get 
out of work. The kids do a lot of activities. They do all that. So we take care of the kids while the parents 
are working. They don't have to worry about their children. So it's good for them. It's helped them a lot. 
We've done it for three years, maybe four years. So yeah, I've seen that it helps them. 
Aaron Paige (08:10): 
Can you tell us the story about how you became a community health worker at Hudson River Healthcare 
or Sun River health? Did you meet another community health worker who inspired you? How did you 
come to know about the job? 
Yaneli Gutierrez (08:27): 
So, I'm close to Kathy. I've known her for years. Maybe since I was a baby, she's known me. She was 
talking to me about it. She had an idea like "If we have a farmworker program, would you be okay with 
being in it?" And I went to some of their talks and I was interested in it. So I was like, "Yeah, I'll go to it." 
And so I started going and going, and I got more interested in it, which I really like, because I love 
helping people. It's the best thing. That's how I joined it. 
Elinor Levy (09:08): 
And how did you become a patient representative? Because you said you sort of have two jobs. 
Speaker 2 (09:14): 
Okay. This is a funny story. So I broke my leg and I had to go up to the clinic, because I went to the 
hospital and I had to get my leg checked, and one of the patient reps, she was like, "Do you want a job 
here?" At the time I was working at a CVS, being a cashier. And I was like, "yeah." And my mom was like, 
"You should take the job. It's good for you. You know?" And so I applied, it took us some months to get 
in there because it's a lot of paperwork. And then from there they accepted me, and then I've been 
working there for a couple months now. And I've also been doing this too on Sundays, and sometimes 
we have meetings on Tuesday. It's really fun. I like being in the community. 
Aaron Paige (10:02): 
What does your work in the community look like? What are you doing with the community? 
Elinor Levy (10:07): 
What's a typical day? 
Aaron Paige (10:08): 
Yeah. What's a typical day? 
Yaneli Gutierrez (10:10): 
In the clinic or down here? 
Elinor Levy (10:12): 
Well, start with the clinic and then we'll move to the other one. 
Yaneli Gutierrez (10:16): 
Okay. With the clinic, I like helping patients. Sometimes going there, some patients don't know how to 
read, write. Which is very stressful, but we help them. We like to help them. If they don't know how to 
sign, we help them with that too. So it's pretty sad seeing stuff like that too. But I understand, because 
people in Mexico that come here never really went to school. So it's sad to see that, but I like helping 
them with that because I understand that. I have family in Mexico that don't know how to write. Like my 
grandma, she doesn't know how to read or write. So I understand it a lot. It's more with the elder people 
than yeah. And then with community health, down here, we do explain it. Our interactions is we go to 
the camps and explain a little bit about what we do. And then we have these little sheets where it's like, 
"Did you like the presentation?" And they all say "yes." 
Elinor Levy (11:27): 
<laugh>. 
Yaneli Gutierrez (11:28): 
And then they kind of explain to us what they do and where they came from. Some of them are 
seasonal. They come from Mexico and plant for some seasons, and then leave back, and then come back 
next year. So it's really interesting seeing people's stories. When I go to the camps, I like seeing the 
people because I like talking to people. 
Aaron Paige (11:56): 
Do you use your own story as a way to connect with people? Do you find that your own experience 
helps you to connect with the workers that you're talking to? 
Yaneli Gutierrez (12:16): 
I personally haven't told them a lot, because we have 30 minutes to talk and then we explain other stuff 
to them. But if I had the chance to tell them, I think they would like it too, because hearing about other 
people's stories is really interesting. And people would be kind of inspired by it too. I've told some 
people, like at my job. I've told them that my parents were farmworkers, how I got here and stuff. They 
liked it because they were like, becuase we're a community, you know? So they're interested in it. 
Elinor Levy (12:53): 
What about some of the people that are around your age and younger? 
Yaneli Gutierrez (12:57): 
My age and younger? 
Elinor Levy (12:59): 
Yeah. Do they relate to you better if they know you grew up the same way they did? 
Yaneli Gutierrez (13:07): 
Yeah, definitely. When I was younger, I grew up in a small place where a lot of the kids' parents were 
farmworkers. So we all got along because of it. We all understood what it was like, because we all went 
through it. I know a lot of kids my age now that I relate to because of how they grew up too, the same 
way I did. 
Elinor Levy (13:35): 
Do they come to you with health issues? 
Yaneli Gutierrez (13:38): 
Hmm. 
Elinor Levy (13:38): 
Or asking advice or... 
Yaneli Gutierrez (13:42): 
Sometimes advice but health issues? Sometimes they say they feel like their parents don't pay much 
attention to them, and it's a problem, but it's also, the parents work so much for their kids to have a 
better life. So I try to tell them "You should understand that." But it's also sad that you kind of have 
absent parents that aren't there all the time. 
Aaron Paige (14:14): 
As a community health worker, is your focus primarily on parent-child relationships? Or are you also 
thinking about other kinds of health needs and general wellness? 
Yaneli Gutierrez (14:43): 
No, we think about all that. 
Aaron Paige (14:45): 
Okay. 
Yaneli Gutierrez (14:45): 
The wellness, the child, the safety and the farms. We talk about all of it. Because there's dangers in the 
farms too. There's a lot of chemicals that could harm them. So we try to explain that to them, to wear 
masks that will help them get the chemicals off their face and them smelling it too much, because it's 
not good for them either. We also talk about maybe wear gloves when you're in the fields because you 
never know what's there, there's also chemicals there. We also talk about that, the danger in the 
vehicles, the tractors, the ATVs, all that stuff. So yeah, we also talk about that. 
Elinor Levy (15:25): 
The bugs, the snakes... 
Yaneli Gutierrez (15:27): 
Yeah, the ticks. 
Aaron Paige (15:29): 
Lime is a big issue. 
Yaneli Gutierrez (15:33): 
Yeah. 
Aaron Paige (15:33): 
It's come up actually in a lot of our interviews so far. 
Yaneli Gutierrez (15:35): 
Yeah. Lime is getting worse. A lot of ticks are coming around now, since it's becoming summer. I think 
now is the time we should speak more to the community workers and talk to them more about the ticks. 
Aaron Paige (15:53): 
When you do your outreach, are you always going to the camps? Is that generally how it works? That 
you go to the camp itself? 
Yaneli Gutierrez (16:04): 
Yeah. We go to the camps, get a group of people. One time we had a group of 10 people and they stand 
there and they listen to us. They understand. I mean they've been through it, you know? We ask first 
because we don't just want to go there and be like, "Oh we want to give a presentation." If they are 
okay with it, we present to them. At the end, we give them little snack bags or handbags and yeah. 
Elinor Levy (16:30): 
So mostly what you're doing is presentations? 
Yaneli Gutierrez (16:33): 
Presentations and helping them out. We also tell them about the clinic, how we could help them. 
Because this clinic, at least sun river, is a community farmworker clinic. So it can help the farmworkers a 
lot if they're injured, if they have a tick bite, because a lot of people can't afford health care or can't get 
it. So the clinic here, we help them a lot too. 
Aaron Paige (16:58): 
After those presentation sessions, do you have time to kind of interact with people individually? Do 
people come up to you and start asking questions? 
Yaneli Gutierrez (17:10): 
Yeah, they do. They ask some more stuff. We answer them. At the end, everyone is just talking to each 
other, just talking about the presentation. We tell them to come here if they need any food, water, like 
anything, because we have a pantry here. So we do tell them about all that and it's very helpful to them. 
They come here every Thursday or Wednesday to get food because some people can't. They don't have 
cars to go to ShopRite or Walmart and stuff like that. 
Elinor Levy (17:40): 
So is there a bus that comes here, or is it walking distance, or how do they get here? 
Yaneli Gutierrez (17:45): 
Some come on their bikes. Some come walking. Some of them, their bosses take them, because they do 
live in a camp sometimes. So their bosses bring them. They get the food. heir bosses takes them back. It 
just depends. Yesterday there was a group of guys that came with their bikes. And they got the food. Put 
it on the bike and rode away with the bike. I'm like, don't drop it. 
Elinor Levy (18:17): 
Are there a lot of single people? Like single men? 
Yaneli Gutierrez (18:23): 
Yeah. 
Elinor Levy (18:23): 
I guess there's lot of men who come up without their families? 
Yaneli Gutierrez (18:27): 
Yeah. There's a lot. They come here for some time, make money, send it to their wife, or their kids. They 
stay here for a while just to make money and make sure their family over there is okay. But a lot of the 
times, in the camps, the single men all live together. There's no women that really live there other than 
the men. So you can go to a camp, and you'll see a lot of single men there. 
Aaron Paige (19:00): 
In terms of the presentations, can you give us maybe several examples of some of the subjects or the 
focuses of the presentations that you do at the camps? 
Yaneli Gutierrez (19:13): 
Like what we talk about? 
Aaron Paige (19:14): 
Yeah. Like what you talk about. 
Yaneli Gutierrez (19:17): 
We talk about farm safety, because that's very important to talk about. We also talk about the dangers 
in animals, like ticks, mosquitoes. We talk about that. 
Yaneli Gutierrez (19:30): 
We talk about all the outside danger basically. We also talk about like when you get home, sometimes 
you're filled with chemicals. So maybe take your boots off, you know, your clothes off. If you have little 
kids. And go in there and change, shower quickly, because you never know what you can bring in your 
house. We also talked about the dangers in like I said, vehicles, so tractors are very dangerous if you 
don't really watch out. So we talked about that. A lot of people have ATVs. And sometimes they're 
dangerous in the fields, to ride them around there. So we basically talk to them about safety and how to 
protect yourself, how to not do this, do that. Because sometimes it is dangerous. So yeah. 
Aaron Paige (20:26): 
And do you do that all in one session or is it kind of broken up over several weeks? 
Yaneli Gutierrez (20:32): 
We do that in one session. Because we ask them. We talk for 30 minutes and we're like, "Are you 
interested in learning more?" And they usually say yes. So we talk the whole session. So they get more 
interested each time we talk about other topics. So yeah, we do do all that in one session. Which is 
really cool, because I like talking to them. 
Elinor Levy (20:54): 
How often do you do the sessions? 
Yaneli Gutierrez (20:57): 
Kathy has us doing them, honestly whenever we can, but we do do them often. We've done a lot of 
sessions lately, 
Elinor Levy (21:06): 
Like once a week, twice a month? 
Yaneli Gutierrez (21:09): 
Maybe like twice a week. 
Elinor Levy (21:11): 
Oh wow. 
Yaneli Gutierrez (21:12): 
Or once a week. 
Yaneli Gutierrez (21:14): 
We go to the camps and do all that. 
Aaron Paige (21:19): 
And will you return to the same camp with any kind of regularity or is there a schedule in terms of how 
you... 
Yaneli Gutierrez (21:27): 
We don't return to the same one because they already had the talk. I don't think they want to hear it 
again. 
Aaron Paige (21:32): 
Got it. 
Yaneli Gutierrez (21:33): 
But we do go to different new camps, and first we ask them, obviously. We go talk to them. Our point is 
to have them be safe and talk to them more about the safety, and our job, and why we do this. We do 
go to different camps. It's not the same people. We kind of want to tell people around Pine Island, 
Florida, Goshen, how it is. So yeah. 
Elinor Levy (22:03): 
Is there any way of tracking? So let's say you've gone to a camp and you've given the talk about safety. Is 
there any way to track whether they've had fewer incidents? 
Yaneli Gutierrez (22:17): 
What do you mean? 
Elinor Levy (22:18): 
Well, so let's say a farm has had 10 incidents a month, you know, off worker accidents. 
Yaneli Gutierrez (22:27): 
Mm-hmm 
Elinor Levy (22:27): 
And then you go and give the talk. Is there any way of finding out if after the talk presentation, if there 
have been fewer accidents per month? 
Yaneli Gutierrez (22:36): 
We haven't done that, but I think we should. I should comment that to Kathy because that's actually a 
really smart idea. But no we haven't. But maybe we should then. 
Elinor Levy (22:47): 
Because that's a benefit to the owners as well. Fewer accidents is fewer... 
Yaneli Gutierrez (22:55): 
Fewer incidents. 
Aaron Paige (22:57): 
Well, fewer accidents, but you know, accidents, cost money and time. 
Aaron Paige (23:04): 
Yeah. It's a way of measuring impact. 
Elinor Levy (23:06): 
Impact and also if the workers know which farms are safer. 
Yaneli Gutierrez (23:11): 
Yeah. 
Elinor Levy (23:12): 
That kind of helps. 
Aaron Paige (23:17): 
I know you said you kind of stepped in to a program that was already going on in terms of the 
community outreach work. When you came in, I am wondering, did you have any of your own insights 
based on your experience, being a young person having grown up in the position that you were in. 
Yaneli Gutierrez (23:38): 
Mm-hmm. 
Aaron Paige (23:38): 
Did you have any insights that kind of shaped the presentations where you said, "Yeah, you're kind of 
missing something here." Or, "You know, you're not really addressing something that I know from my 
experience, can we shape this presentation a little bit?" 
Yaneli Gutierrez (23:58): 
How do I explain it? There's some things, yeah. Because there are some things that you feel iffy about 
because you've been through it, like you've seen your parents go through it. So there was some things, 
but I think we commented to her about it. She changed it up. She kind of likes having people that have 
been through it because if she's wrong about something, we correct it. 
Aaron Paige (24:29): 
Right. 
Yaneli Gutierrez (24:30): 
And we have done that a lot. So we correct the things and we make it so it's more comfortable for the 
people. 
Aaron Paige (24:38): 
mm-hmm. 
Yaneli Gutierrez (24:38): 
Yeah. 
Aaron Paige (24:39): 
I think that kind of feedback process is so important. Could you give an example, or one or two examples 
of just that? How that might have happened? 
Yaneli Gutierrez (24:51): 
Let me think. I guess there was this one time. I think she was talking about, I really don't...I'm trying to 
think of when... 
Aaron Paige (25:10): 
There's no rush, honestly. 
Yaneli Gutierrez (25:17): 
It's just like, her thoughts are different from what actually happens. 
Elinor Levy (25:22): 
And this is Kathy you're talking about? 
Yaneli Gutierrez (25:25): 
Yeah, yeah. She understands it, but if you didn't grow up in it, you really don't understand it. 
Aaron Paige (25:30): 
Yeah. She'd be the first to acknowledge that. 
Yaneli Gutierrez (25:32): 
Yeah. 
Aaron Paige (25:32): 
So I think that's why she's... 
Yaneli Gutierrez (25:34): 
She asks us for feedback. There are things she is right about. So she's like "Any feedback?" We're like, 
"No, that's fine. That's fine." But there is some things that aren't really correct. So we kind of correct her 
about it. Because farmwork, my mom was a farmworker. She's in it too. So she corrects it too. 
Elinor Levy (25:56): 
Oh, your mother's a community health worker as well? 
Yaneli Gutierrez (25:58): 
Yeah, yeah. 
Elinor Levy (26:03): 
If you were given the opportunity to create a presentation, what would that presentation be? 
Yaneli Gutierrez (26:10): 
Like for community health? 
Elinor Levy (26:12): 
Yeah. If Kathy said "You can create a program, you can present it" What would you want to do? Who 
would you want to present it to? 
Yaneli Gutierrez (26:22): 
Definitely the farmworkers. Because I would want present about.... First of all, I'd want to know their 
story. Then I'd know what to talk to them about. Because there's some things that probably are 
irrelevant to them. So it's nice to know stuff like that. But... 
Tamales Seller (26:49): 
TAMALES! Tamales, arroz con leche, champorado. 
Aaron Paige (26:53): 
You want any? 
Elinor Levy (26:53): 
yeah sure. 
Yaneli Gutierrez (26:59): 
They're good. 
Elinor Levy (27:00): 
Are they good? 
Yaneli Gutierrez (27:01): 
Yeah. 
Aaron Paige (27:01): 
Sure. 
Elinor Levy (27:02): 
Yeah. Why don't we stop for a minute. 
Elinor Levy (27:08): 
So we were talking about... 
Aaron Paige (27:10): 
If Yaneli had the choice to create... 
Elinor Levy (27:13): 
Yeah, we were talking about, if you got to create a program, what type of presentation would it be? And 
you were saying you'd like to talk to the workers and find out what they want to know. 
Yaneli Gutierrez (27:25): 
Yeah. 
Elinor Levy (27:25): 
So you should do that. 
Yaneli Gutierrez (27:26): 
I should, I really should. 
Elinor Levy (27:29): 
Would you ever want to do presentations to the teens? 
Yaneli Gutierrez (27:36): 
Yeah. I feel like they should. They need some talk too. 
Aaron Paige (27:42): 
What kind of things would you want to address with them or with the workers that are maybe not being 
addressed currently, or that you see as a need that you would like to talk about? 
Yaneli Gutierrez (27:55): 
Okay. Something I just realized, the workers, a lot of workers come from Mexico seasonal, right? So a lot 
of workers right now are here for a couple months only. And they don't get that talk at all by their 
bosses or anything. So they kind of just do what their boss tells them, "Oh, plant this, plant that" or "Do 
this, do that." You know? So they don't really get to talk about safety. So I think it's actually really good 
that we talk about it to people that really didn't ever get to talk about it. Because a lot of people, are 
clueless about the safety and chemicals, the ants, the ticks, the mosquitoes, and all that. 
Elinor Levy (28:39): 
So making sure that you're there at the beginning of the season to give them the talk. 
Yaneli Gutierrez (28:42): 
Yeah. Yeah. I'm sure they need it. 
Elinor Levy (28:45): 
What do you wish someone had told you about when you were growing up and your parents were 
working in the camps? What do you wish that someone had come and talked to you about as a child or 
as a teenager? 
Yaneli Gutierrez (29:06): 
Just to understand them more and how they go through all that. How they're out here working long 
hours for me and my siblings to be okay. Because I think as a child, you don't really know much about it. 
You just want this, want that. So maybe if I was more educated about it, I would've understood them 
more. But as I grew up, I understood it more. 
Elinor Levy (29:36): 
Right. 
Yaneli Gutierrez (29:37): 
But as a child you don't really. But if people talk to you about it, children are really prone to listen to 
you. Because I have cousins, they listen a lot. I tell them a lot. They like talking. 
Elinor Levy (29:51): 
What was it like to be the child of a farmworker at school? 
Yaneli Gutierrez (29:58): 
I went to a very white school. So it was... I don't know, half the time my parents would be working. 
There'd be like those days, like Christmas. You'd have those gingerbread house with your parents. And 
my parents couldn't go. I'd be upset when I saw other parents. A lot of parents that work in the farm 
can't really make it to their kids' events sometimes. 
Yaneli Gutierrez (30:29): 
So, it would make me upset that parents would go there and then my parents wouldn't show up 
because they were working. So it's really different growing up in a place where you see parents come 
and then you're just there with your parents working. I kind of tried to understand it, but I was a child. 
So I was like damn. I don't really think about it because I understand. I'm like, "Okay, they did this for 
me." You know? But as I grew up, I didn't really think about it, because once you're in middle school, 
high school, you don't need your parents to go with you anywhere. It's only like elementary school 
school, right? 
Aaron Paige (31:18): 
Yeah, yeah. 
Yaneli Gutierrez (31:18): 
So yeah. After that you just do you. You know, have fun. 
Aaron Paige (31:24): 
Yaneli, you mentioned that one of the things you like to do most is help people. You've been doing it 
professionally now. But before you started doing this work as a community health worker, how were 
you helping? I mean, you were helping your family of course. But how were you helping the community 
or your friends, or family in other ways, just growing up? 
Yaneli Gutierrez (31:47): 
I actually did this before I even started this. It was maybe two years ago. It was during COVID, every 
Thursday I would deliver food to families that couldn't go out because of COVID and stuff. So we'd get a 
big van. We put a lot of milks for the families and then a lot of food for the week. So every Thursday we 
would deliver the food to the families, which was really helpful to them. A lot of their kids, because of 
COVID, stayed home. The parents would work. They couldn't cook for them. You know? So sometimes 
we'd have pre-made meals for the kids too. So we helped them a lot, he parents a lot with not worrying 
too much about feeding their kids because we already had food for the week for them. 
Aaron Paige (32:39): 
Wow. That's amazing. 
Yaneli Gutierrez (32:40): 
Yeah. So that was before I started all that. I liked doing that. Now, COVID is still going up, but it's not as 
bad as it used to, be. So we don't really do it anymore. But if it got to that point where it got bad again, I 
feel like we would do it again. 
Elinor Levy (32:58): 
You said that sometimes the workers, when they get injured or sick, they don't want to come here 
because they can't pay for it. Or they don't know that this is free and that they can come here. If they 
end up having to go to the hospital, do you go with them to the hospital, or does someone go with 
them? 
Yaneli Gutierrez (33:18): 
No. From experience my dad, he doesn't have insurance. He's not a citizen here either. He got really sick 
with his heart, like to the point where he had a heart attack. We had to take him to the hospital. He had 
no insurance. But in the hospital, they also do help you. The ER, they gave my dad emergency insurance, 
which covered everything, everything in the hospital. He stayed there for three weeks. So, I think they're 
scared that they have to pay high bills, but you just have to look into benefits and stuff like that. Because 
my dad was like, "I'm not paying all that." 
Elinor Levy (33:59): 
So I'm just curious how he found out about those benefits. If you remember. 
Yaneli Gutierrez (34:06): 
I think through the hospital. They told him. 
Elinor Levy (34:08): 
So he didn't have to ask, but they told him? 
Yaneli Gutierrez (34:11): 
They let him know about... because a lot of people can't afford medical bills. It's expensive. 
Aaron Paige (34:18): 
And I know that's the role that Marilyn, Olga, Ed also play as patient navigators. So they help people 
navigate those complex insurance issues. 
Yaneli Gutierrez (34:32): 
And they have connections. So they can get stuff lowered for the patients and stuff, which is good. 
Aaron Paige (34:41): 
One question we've been asking all of our interviewees is what qualities do you see in yourself that you 
feel make you good at the work that you do as a community health worker? 
Yaneli Gutierrez (34:56): 
Honestly, just growing up around it. It helps me a lot because I understand it, you know. I honestly 
wasn't a farmworker myself, but my parents were. I know their minds. I know how they feel. Because 
my mom, me and her are really close. She kind of explained it to me. I think growing up in it really 
helped a lot by understanding them way more than someone who doesn't really grow up in it. Just 
hearing it, you know? 
Elinor Levy (35:33): 
What do you want to do in the future? 
Yaneli Gutierrez (35:38): 
I want to still work around helping people. I want to be an L& D, Labor and Delivery Nurse. While on the 
side, I want to do community health work to help people. I kind of want do both of those. I just like 
helping people. 
Aaron Paige (36:01): 
You know, me, I always, I can always keep going. 
Elinor Levy (36:04): 
Well, she also has to get back to work. 
Aaron Paige (36:06): 
Yeah, that's true. 
Elinor Levy (36:06): 
It's 10 30. 
Aaron Paige (36:07): 
I think we've got a few more minutes. In the time that you've been working as a community health 
worker, have you... 
Mario Fernandez (36:18): 
Buenos dias. 
Yaneli Gutierrez (36:23): 
Good morning. 
Aaron Paige (36:24): 
Hi, good morning. 
Mario Fernandez (36:25): 
Sorry. Nikki called her. She was coming late and also my wife had surgery last night. I've got to take care 
of some things, but you were waiting for... You are the guy from? 
Elinor Levy (36:39): 
We're waiting for... 
Aaron Paige (36:40): 
We were going to speak with Mario. 
Mario Fernandez (36:42): 
Yes. So, I'm busy. So welcome. And I'm sorry. 
Aaron Paige (36:50): 
Oh no, not at all. Is that Mario? Oh, okay. 
Yaneli Gutierrez (36:59): 
So you gonna do him too or? 
Aaron Paige (37:01): 
Yeah, we are, 
Elinor Levy (37:03): 
Yeah. 
Aaron Paige (37:03): 
Yeah, exactly. 
Yaneli (37:04): 
Yeah, I like Mario. He is a good guy. 
Aaron Paige (37:05): 
Oh, look at that. Rosada just called. One of the promotoras that we spoke to. Thinking about your work 
over the last few years as a community health worker, can you identify maybe an occasion where you 
really felt the value and the impact of your work on a particular person or an individual that you saw 
kind of transformed or that you were able to reach or help in some way and share that story? 
Yaneli Gutierrez (37:50): 
A lot with single moms and single dads, because they're taking care of their kids while working in the 
fields for hours and hours. 
Mario Fernandez (38:02): 
I'm sorry. I don't want to interrupt you. You are interviewing already. So I just want to get it right. So 
you're going to interview her first, right? 
Aaron Paige (38:12): 
Yeah, yeah. 
Man (38:12): 
Okay, then I'm sorry. 
Aaron Paige (38:14): 
Oh, no, you're fine. We'll be done in probably like 10 minutes or so. 
Mario Fernandez (38:18): 
If you want to be more private, there's another office there because soon people come. 
Aaron Paige (38:23): 
Maybe when we speak in a little bit we can head inside. 
Mario Fernandez (38:26): 
I'm sorry to interrupt you. 
Aaron Paige (38:27): 
No, it's fine. Thanks. 
Yaneli Gutierrez (38:34): 
But yeah, I feel more connected to the parents that are single because it's hard for them. They can't do 
everything at once, but they still do it for their kids. 
Aaron Paige (38:51): 
Are there any particular stories, like an individual who... 
Elinor Levy (39:10): 
We are not asking you to name or names or anything. 
Aaron Paige (39:11): 
But to reflect on someone's specific experience that impacted you hearing it. And someone that you felt 
you really wanted to kind given the situation that they were in, and you were able to help them. 
Yaneli Gutierrez (39:28): 
There was this one person. He passed away already, but he lived alone. He would work in the farm for 
months. I mean, not months, like days. All day, all night, just so he could pay rent, all that stuff. Me and 
my mom would go to his house and deliver him food or any clothes or anything because he didn't really 
have the money to. So we would do all that for him just because we wanted to help him out. We knew 
he was going through a lot, doing all that, trying to pay rent. I feel like they should make more than they 
do because they are the ones who plant and I feel like they should higher up their raise. It's kind of 
upsetting how much they make while they work really hard for just like maybe $13 an hour, $12 an 
hour. 
Elinor Levy (40:35): 
And some of them live on the property? 
Yaneli Gutierrez (40:40): 
On the property. 
Elinor Levy (40:40): 
So do they end up giving some of that money back to the owner and rent? 
Yaneli Gutierrez (40:44): 
Sometimes the owners let them live there for free, just so they can work for them. So, they live there for 
free and they work for them. They do get paid for their work, but they don't have to pay rent. Other 
times, they do have to pay rent and they have to work for it, too. But most of the time, they let them 
live there for free. 
Aaron Paige (41:14): 
Is there anything else that you would want to add, or share about your work as a community health 
worker? 
Yaneli Gutierrez (41:25): 
I look forward to more. I just started this a couple months ago, so I look forward to doing this more and 
helping out people, changing their lives, maybe in a way. Just being remembered by people by helping 
them. 
Elinor Levy (41:49): 
Thank you. 
Aaron Paige (41:50): 
Yeah. Thank you so much. 
Elinor Levy (41:51): 
Thank you for sitting with us and thank you for the work that you do. 
Yaneli Gutierrez (41:56): 
Thank you. 
Elinor Levy (41:57): 
Cause it's important.
