SIDE 1 
Family business 
Seasonal business at Collette Catering and Take-out. 
How the business began. She and her sisters always cooked, except 
for one. 
Saint Joseph's Day 
First Saint Joseph's Day Table in JoAnna's family given by her 
mother for a sister of JoAnna's, Stella, who received a hip 
injury in a horse accident in 1944 or 1945. Details of the injury 
given. Brief mention of miracles, beliefs and customs. Saint 
Joseph is the patron of Sicily so a lot of prayers to him. 
JoAnna Collette's mother born in Grimaldi, Calabria, Italy. Did 
not learn the custom in Italy. Learned it from a Mrs. Zinno, a 
neighbor. Breads and cookies are her mother's recipe. 
Tables used to be more frequent, then diminished. JoAnna and Al's 
first table when their son John was five years old, in 1965; the 
tables were coming back then. John was having seizures so offered 
IAW-PM-A001 - 
2 
a table for Saint Joseph 's intercession . Never had a seizure 
after he was seven years old . He had a seizure five years ago. 
Paola Tavarelli : How are the tables referred to? 
JoAnna Collette : we call it an o_tfe•YnT Last year heard it 
called a dovere when a relative in Salt Lake City called for 
information about the table. 
The tables never died out completely but for a while not media 
coverage so people were not aware of where the tables were. 
Probably a lot out in the country, around Blende . A lady out 
there used to have a small one. She died (can't remember her 
name ). She did the table for the family but wouldn 't turn any one 
away, made the traditional food. 
Have to have a big fish --halibut , cod, sardis. Certain fish have 
to be on the table . No meat, though . (Flipping through a photo 
alBlum of tables ). Try to get the biggest fish they can find. Two 
ways to offer the table : to beg for food and donations, knocking 
on doors of Italian people . They did it that way for a table. 
Donations offered to Saint Joseph in donor's name. Mother helped 
her. JoAnna and Al's idea to have the table. 
Al Collette: 
Custom relatively new to Joanna's family . His grandmother made 
the table pretty far back , in an Italian neighborhood. Italians 
in  Goat Hil 
om. His parents 
came from Goat Hill , grandparents from Italy . Grandmother from 
Sicily; uncertain about father's side of family. 
JoAnna Collette: 
Her father came to America when he was 14, to Seattle, 
Washington , where he had relatives . His father wanted to come to 
a farming community . Her father from Calabria. Her mother and 
father both had farms in Italy . In Colorado, first lived in Ideal 
Camp in Walsenburg , about eight miles above . A coal mining camp. 
Grandfather worked the mine-s--u ntil he saved enough money_to 
buy 
land above the camp . Tried farming there . Her Dad is 90 years 
old, grows peaches, figs , other fruits . His name is Frank Nigro. 
Parents from Calabria ; Frank and Rose; live on Routt (a street). 
Had a farm, altitude too high except for Mexican beans and corn 
so started raising goats and pigs . Made living buy selling 
ricotta. Her nephew , Joe Vasile , learned from her father . (Offers 
cheese made by Joe Vasile). 
Al Collette: 
Joe Vasile has been making cheese lately. 
JoAnna Collette (with Al Collette): 
(referring to food in the photos ) Fiq chalice, heart ... we made 
these more like modern-day. Someone made the Host (Monstance) for 
IAW-PM-A001 -

us. Beautiful cutwork with the dough . Frances Musso did the 
cutwork , a talented baker ; she passed away. Some people from 
Si-c
-1
-11y,
Mario and Lucia, calls them cucidati . Second Saint 
Joseph 's Day Table , about 1970 . Was given in thanksgiving ... Saint 
Joseph 's bread , more eggs than rPcru1ar bread 
Hard-boiled egsg
 
biked--•i 
Al Collette (with Joanna): 
Older Italians made old style of tables which were flat, not 
tiered . We have to hang on to it, not many ... we made one before 
grandmother passed away . We tried to get it down on paper; they 
did stuff that they didn 't even know why they did it themselves. 
Meaning behind it gone. (We use tiers because ) I think it's 
su 
d to be an altar ,
 with Saint Joseph at the highest point. 
Also , you get a better view. F at ones cluttered, Jumbled mess. I 
can remember my grandmother made flat ones. Joanna : it is very 
beautiful no matter how it's done . Al describes the tables he 
remembers as a child . Children didn 't help/### 
SIDE II 
Al Collette: 
Mostly women helped although his uncle was a baker so he must 
have did something . Dad, a carpenter , built the altar. This 
particular table , we used people who baptized or confirmed us, or 
who we baptized or confirmed. 
JoAnna Collette : this one was in thanksgivinq , a -joyous 
celebration . (Identifies people in the photo.) 
' 
Language use: 
Al Collette (with Joanna): use to use copadre or comadre for 
grandparents . Used to call an aunt zizi, but not until he was an 
adult did he realize he was calling her auntie . Grandparents 
spoke almost no English at all. My parents both spoke fluent 
Italian, but I never picked it up because never spoke Italian to 
the children . Could pick some of it out. 
Church affiliations/local churches: 
We went to Mount Carmel ; three churches in the same area, Clark 
Street. Saint Mary 's was Slovenian, Saint Anthony's for the 
Spanish people . They went to Mount Carmel too, from the smelter. 
Bojon refers to Slovenian or Polish. 
JoAnna Collette : originally family went to Mount Carmel until the 
Assumption Parish built on Evans . Used to walk over tracks to 
IAW-PM-A001 - 
4 
Mount Carmel. 
Al Collette: a lot of Italians in Bessemer. Dispersed now but 
Mount Carmel still considered the Italian church. Used to be 
severe boundaries. Slovenians still go to Saint Mary's church. 
My family from Goat Hill, before the flood they lived in the 
Santa Fe area. 
Family histories: 
JoAnna Collette: born in Walsenburg; family moved to Pueblo in 
1944, 1945, or in the 40's before the war was over. Dad a barber 
at the Pueblo Ordinance Depot. Not sure what they did at the 
depot, had airborne and army troops. 
John Collette: they shuttled aircraft. 
JoAnna Collette (with Al): father a barber until the depot closed 
down, then went to work at the school district. From the Mesa, 
people went to Saint Joseph's church, in Vineland there's Saint 
Teresa... for the farmers. JoAnna: we had a little car and every 
Sunday we would go to Mount Carmel. Most of the Sicilians in the 
Mesa went to Saint Joseph's Church. It hasn't been there too 
long; built by Father Murray after he left Mount Carmel. Al 
disagrees with Joanna. JoAnna used to go to Sacred Heart 
Cathedral on Main Street, the bishop's church. 
We got married at the Assumption Church, customary to marry in 
the bride's parish. In the old days, churches didn't have Saint 
Joseph's Day Tables, but now they do--Saint Therese's, Saint 
Leander, Holy Rosary and Saint Pius churches. Only within the 
past four or five years. Technically not a church custom. 
Saint Joseph's Day: 
JoAnna Collette: 
Feast of Saint Joseph story given to them by the priest. He comes 
to the house to bless the table. Al: used to say a rosary too. 
Now they say masses. Don't say the rosary if there's a mass. 
Olden days was a custom to say the rQca y at X2.00 hPfore you 
br a 
 P table. "Break the table" means  serve the food, to the 
saints. Plates from the table given to the people who are saints 
(5-13 saints. 
Tables usually set the t-abl inpr•• 
; room; saints must have 
everything on the table; then people in the kitchen. Must 
understand all the food on the table is blessed and can't be 
thrown away; if not eaten, should be blessed. If any left, given 
to 
poor. A lot of times the food was given to orphanages, and 
orphans a lot of times sat in at the table to represent saints. 
IAW-PM-A001 -

My Mom even invited people off the street. Some still do that. 
What we did on this one, was a thanksgiving, because our first 
table was answered. First table, had sick people who were saints, 
needed help. Friends of Al's from work who were terminal' 
grandmother, a young boy with leukemia but parents' refused to 
let him. Most were Italian people familiar with the custom. 
Have tt•hasce-Je 
Mary and_—Oseph 
Al 's mother wanted Saint 
Rock, Saint Therese. People took the saints' names. Saints can 
vyar; 
taint Jude for the helpless at a table for a sister of 
Joanna's who was dying of cancer. Saint Anne, always have Saint 
Anne, the mother of Mary. Saint Lucy, one of the Italian saints. 
Can't remember all of them. No costumes. Article about the 
tradition--not particularly our views, but given to them by 
priest. 
Not familiar with custom of people representing Mary and Joseph 
knock on doors, reenacting their search for lodging at an inn. 
JoAnna (with Al) : start the *1pho_W1_} tea r' a} p wit•ard

there's only one Jesus . Lamb has a blue ribbon. Some components 
can vary. One table_ fbl_Ue one) had a canopy made from bedspreads

JoAnna and Al Collette: 
We used to put seven-day candles on the table; kept table up for 
seven days ; lit for the saints . A lot of people put money on the 
t ble , don 
, even when we didn ' have a bowl for it. Not 
san 
airy, so we put a bowl for money ', on the table . With the money 
collected , had masses said for the people who were saints at the 
table or gave money to the poor, or to Saint Joseph 's church in 
Blende; wherever there was a need. Not required that people give 
money. 
Statue of Saint Joseph in the home: 
Statue of Saint Joseph on the table. Al's mother bought them a 
statue of Saint Joseph for their anniversary. Al had been looking 
for one. Saint Joseph has always been Al's patron saint. The 
IAW-PM-A001 - 
6 
statue is at the top of the stairs in the hallway. Al has spotted 
that statue at a religious store; they couldn't afford, but he 
was trying to save money for it. Al had his eye on the statue for 
several months, he was planning on buying it. Al went in the 
store one day, and the statue was gone. 
He felt terrible, went 
home upset. Al: of course, the church is playing down statues. I 
can remember that people didn't pay attention in church they were 
so busy going around to the different statues or stations of the 
cross. I think that was part of the reasons to play down statues. 
Put our belief where it really should be. 
Patron saints/naming traditions: 
Al's special devotion to Saint Joseph, maybe because he was the 
saint of families. Joanna has a special devotion to the Blessed 
Mother. Some old people aware of saint associated with their 
names. JoAnna: we would buy our children statues of the saints 
associated with their names; and colors associated with saints. 
Second son John named after Al's father. Third son has JoAnna's 
father's name, Frank, for a middle name. Daughters were named 
after saints they were born close to. One named after Saint 
Therese Church because we had moved so/###

SIDE 1 
Naming traditions: 
Neither Al nor his sister named after a family member; everyone 
in the family had a "Sylvester" named after Al's grandfather. Al 
named after another relative; Joanna after her uncle, John. 
Parents wanted Giovanna, but priest wrote JoAnna on her birth 
certificate because priest couldn't understand her parents. 
Middle name Dolores after nurse who helped with the delivery. 
Saint Joseph's Day Table: 
Third one for ... Lorraine (JoAnna's sister); helped with another 
one in the Mesa for Jack Spinuzzi in about 1975. 
(Al: tables 
about five years apart). Women came to her house to do  
the 
baking, prepare food. Only one 
one 
y he Spinuzzi; he had cut 
mse 
hi 
with an axe; was diabetic; got gangrene. He asked them to 
help. JoAnna: we had four tables of our own; Jack's was the 
fifth. One for Lorraine; uncertain why they had the other. Had 
them at their other house on Regis. 
IAW-PM-A002 -

Vegetables used: favis, spinach, cauliflower, turnips, carduni, 
she 
anise, 
c o es, asparagus. Carduni and anise specially 
or-dered out of Denver. Eggplant as part of decorations; also 
pineapple and fresh fruit. Favi beans in an fritatte (omelets). 
Superstitions: 
Never heard of custom of giving dried fava beans to people 
attending the event so they will have good luck (Note: they do 
this in Dallas and Bryan, Texas). JoAnna: some of the customs are 
superstitious; a lot of the Italians Sicilians are superstitious; 
JoAnna is not. Garlic tied around neck to ward off evil spirits; 
a very attractive person is supposed to wear a red ribbon, so 
they won't get the mal occhio, the bad eye; Al: or put a piece of 
red ribbon somewhere if they are going to give your house the bad 
eye; or the three symbols--the horn, two fingers and ?--hung on 
red ribbon on neck. Now the young kids wear the horn not 
realizing it's an Italian symbol. Al's Mom still has some 
superstitions. She and her Aunt Lucy used to help with the Saint 
Joseph's Day table. 
Introduces daughter Stephanie. 
Stephanie Collette's Upcoming Italian Wedding 
Kids trying to talk them into doing another one (table). 
Stephanie knows how to make some of the foods. Kids help at the 
shop: make ravioli, gnocchi, etc. Six out of seven children now 
work at the shop. Stephanie youngest; will marry in November; 
will have a "big Italian wedding." Six to seven hundred people 
invited--truly Italian. Al and JoAnna do all the cooking. 
Ceremony at Our Lady of the Meadows; reception at Saint Therese 
Church. Will have a dance, DJ, bake Italian cookies. Will have 
Italian favors; candies from Bessemer Mercantile; wrapped in 
nets; wine cookies; Italian wine. 
Wine Making: 
This year, Al and children made wine from bought grapes. Al used 
to make it more often, then quit; kids want to know how, so he 
taught them. Vineland, beyond Mesa, used to grow a lot of grapes. 
Weddings/Tarantella: 
Used to be some orchestras that played at Italian weddings; 
played the tarantella. Al and JoAnna learned it, but don't do it 
well. Victoria Marian used to teach it at school; like stomping 
it on a tarantula. JoAnna: mother taught them like a little 
village girl and boy used to; she tries to shake a spider off her 
IAW-PM-A002 -

skirt; he tries to stomp it. Stephanie's fiance mostly Irish; 
other children married people who are half Italian. For Al and 
JoAnna, no pressure to marry Italians, even though they (parents) 
would have liked it. One man wanted to marry JoAnna; wanted to 
make a mashotra (?), a match. JoAnna and her father said no; she 
was waiting for Al who was in the Navy. Married in 1958. 
Birthdays and Children: 
Joanna born October 24, 1936 in Walsenburg. Al on November 25, 
1936 in Pueblo. Married in 1958 in Pueblo. Children: Stephanie, 
John, Patrick, Karen, Timothy, JoAnna and Therese. Named one 
after Joanna; Therese named after the church. 
Saint Joseph's Day Table: 
Bessie Ingo and Frances Musso, who made the fancy cut dough 
things, were related. Had "Saint Joe" spelled out in dough--
honey, flour and eggs. Most of the cookies made out of eggs, 
which represent new life, and that's what the table is all about. 
Related to Easter? 
Al: couldn't eat meat during Lent. Supposedly 
tables started in Italy when there was a tremendous famine ... they 
threw the table when they had plenty of food to eat. As far as 
fish go, so many times fish are mentioned in the Bible. Not sure 
about the lack of meat. 
Joanna: this is a fig piece with little chicks to represent new 
life. Belong to the Affiliates of Mary, Marianist priests, and 
they say "Saint Joe" out of family-ness ... trying to be cute. Al: 
we have uncles named Joseph, and we call them Joe; weren't trying 
to be disrespectful. 
Do not have pictures on the table. We don't have a "host iron," 
to cook with nuts and honey in a wafer to represent the Host. 
Can't find the cast iron ones. 
Joanna: hand of Saint Joseph, mallet or hammer of Saint JQsegh, 
his staff, 
have to be on the table. Honey balls (pi_ggnolati); ossa 
de morte (muscardni?G; of  sugar, flour and water. Ne-Hi pop used 
for color; old customs; hard to find now. Al makes patisa,  a 
Slovenian nut bread, because it's his talent. Stuffed artichokes; 
sprouted-wheat; homemade wine-;-modica--hreadcrumbs_-never heard 
that it represents the saw dust of Saint Joseph the carpenter/###

moved to town, started to learn English; speaks better than her 
Dad. Both talk Italian, Spanish and English. Talk Italian to each

would make fun of Al; and his family make fun of JoAnna. 
JoAnna's father and his cousin grew up in Spokane, 
Washington... couple of hell-raisers... 21 or 22 years old. JoAnna 
has four sisters and one brother; he just retired from CF&I; his 
son just opened up a restaurant Michael's--not an Italian 
restaurant. JoAnna's father had to quit barbering after the war 
because the state wouldn't give him papers. Had to pass the state 
barber test, and couldn't read well enough. Worked then as a

Saint Joseph's Day Table: 
Looking through photo album (see fieldnotes). 
Josephine: newspaper article on the table the Martellaro's gave 
in March 1990. Invitation to school district. 
Thirteen saints at their table. Have to have an odd number of 
saints, from seven up. Asked several people and no one knew why. 
Josephine speculates on the odd number required. 
Schemata of foods on the table. Table on display 24 hours before 
food served. Perishable food refrigerated overnight; used several 
refrigerators. Cookies and breads prepared ahead and frozen. 
Tony's mother always made bread patties on Fridays during Lent; 
ingredients given. 
Wheat from Scaplo gardens; also gave four lilies. Palm trees 
loaned from Fabian Florist. Didn't know other people would donate 
things. Bessie In  o he 
ed; Josephine Gaqliano too. Lilies didn't 
open up for Saint Joseph's Day. 
Josephine did not tell Tony she was having a Saint Joseph's Day 
Table. The  table was given to thank Saint Joseph for Tony's 
recovery. Josephine tells of a prayer to Saint Joseph; supposed 
IAW-PM-AO03 - 
2 
to 
say it nine times a day; helps with problems; helps her 
through the day. 
Tony: people would ask him about the table; but he didn't know 
about it. 
Josephine: told him on Valentine's Day. Recites prayer to Saint 
Joseph, and other saints. Learned it from a friend. Tony did not 
even attend a cousin's table a year ago because he was so ill 
with rheumatoid arthritis. Details about the illness. 
Grand-
daughter Brittany (Carleo) had eczema, allergies and a foot 
problem. Two of three intentions answered. Maybe the third one 
will be answered in the future. Details about the illness. 
Pages 6 and 7 of the album: recipes start. Some from Jenny 
Rodasta's husband's mother. Discusses the recipes, who gave them 
to her, or where she got them (books). 
Finocchio, wheat, palms, artichokes, fish and omelets have to be 
on the table. Cookies can vary. Continues to list some of the 
cookies and talk about the recipes. 
Mrs. Croshal, Josephine's mother, interjects something (can't 
hear her) about the baking. 
Josephine, Jenny Rodasta (her sister-in-law) and Debbie 
Martellaro Carleo coordinated the event. Bessie Ingo helped a 
lot. They are putting__everu hing dawn cn the tradition ran

Hard to hear Josephine Gagliano. When Paula Manini asks if they 
are familiar with certain traditions (giving out the fava beans, 
peacocks on the table, meaning of the pignolati, burying inedible 
leftover food), she did so to compare/contrast the tables given 
in Pueblo to those held in Dallas, Texas. 
Immigration and Family History: 
Both born in Lucca Sicula. Related to Tony Martellaro (see file). 
Anthony's uncle Joe Gagliano (Bessemer Mercantile) first one in 
the family to anme to Pueblo; then his brother Vito came. Joe 
Gagliano first worked in the mill. Had one cow; would sell milX 
be  ore going to work. Eventually had a grocery store and a ?. 
Vito and Joe Gagliano s arted it together, and then separated 
when they got married. Vito started a store called Vito 
Gagliano's Grocery. 
Came because of the mill, railroads and mines. When they left 
Anthony's father was 
a 
years old. After the 
Korean War, 1953, there was a law you could come to the US to 
visit your relations... Uncles hadn't seen their family in 45 
years. Anthony's father, Vincent, and Anthony (16 years old) came 
to visit; left behind mother, two sisters and a brother. Didn't 
know any English; his uncle said if you want to stay, the father 
could work in the store; Anthony went to school, ninth grade. Two 
and a half-years later, the mother came. Bought a house next to 
Bessemer Mercantile; father worked for the uncle. After eight 
IAW-PM-AO05 - 
2 
years , Anthony took a trip to Italy , and met his wife, got 
married in Lucca Sicula. 
Their families lived a half block away in Lucca Sicula (near 
Sciacca, province of Agrigento). Anthony gone back on vacation 
with a friend when he met Josephine . Engaged for 20 days, married 
for 20 days , and Anthony left. Josephine came December 7, 1963. 
Anthony went to visit her brother, that's how they met. Married 
in the local church on September 7, 1963; double wedding with 
Josephine 's brother . About 1,000 people came ; reception held in a 
theater ; served sweets; dance band. Married at 10 am, celebrated 
until 6 pm. 
Anthony has work for Dana Corporation (manufactures pistons, 
aluminum ) since 1959. Josephine 's mother, Silvia , stayed in 
Sicily, passed away . Anthony 's mother's maiden name was Capiti 
(?). Josephine 's maiden name ?. 
Saint Joseph's Day: 
What we did in Italy was not like here.. it's a little 
Americanized , a lot of cookies and stuff. In Italy, the bread, 
Y 
the main thing , the macaroni, thA orange  
and the fish. This  
is 
how mall started ; as the years went by, you'd add stuff to it. 
In Italy , just have a table (not tiered ). Josephine 's brother 
just had one last year--500 (?) pounds of flour for bread. Saint 
Joseph is the patron saint of Lucca . If this or that came out 
alrig 
--1  
-7 s a promise and then you have to keep the promise. 
Josephine 's mother used to do Saint Joseph's Day tables in 
Sicily ; not as big; almost every yeAr. 
Given to honor Saint 
Joseph for his intercession in a family crisis. 
Josephine dreams about Saint Joseph . Story of why they did the 
table for their ••n 
Love of the children. 
Anthony refers to photo album (see notes ), to some of the people 
who represented the saints, why t 
fie
- y were chosen, their 
illnesses . Keeps photo album for children , in case they ever want 
to do a table . Josephine lists the saints; they list some of the 
people who represented the saints. 
The way it started , people begged for help with the table, and 
you don 't stop until someone says no. But they don 't do it here. 
Refers to people and organizations to whom they donated money 
collected for the table , including an Italian relative and 
candelabra for an altar to Saint Joseph in a church in Lucca. 
Gave all the money away. 
Mother didn 't beg, but Josephine 's sister did do it. Can make 
begging part of the promise . (Having a table) costs a lot, but 
IAW-PM-AO05 - 
3 
worth it. 
List of things people brought for the table. We wrote everything 
down ... we won't be here for ever. Josephine wrote down the 
schedule (of preparation). Can have-3, 5, 
7, 
11, nr 71 taints; 
thirteen to represent the Last Supper. Don't know why an odd 
number. Really represents the Last Supper. Meatless. 
Always have to have the Holy Family. Refer to a written story 
about how they table started in the US; rosary too. Said a rosary 
in Italian. We always speak Italian (public), but everything else 
in Sicilian. Priest blessed the table. 
Belong to Saint Therese's Church. Table blessed by a priest from 
another church; the one from Saint Therese's church came later. 
Bessie Ingo made the (breads reprPgPn_ting) Moon, Saint Joseph's 
?, and ?. Josephine knew how to do a lot of things, but not 
everything. A lot of people helped, Mr. and Mrs. Giannetta and 
Mrs. Abbate. Mrs. Abbate made the fig Chalir-e and r,.anP. Varnished 
to preserve them; cousin Tony (Martellaro) used them. 
Refers to album: photos of putting together the table. Table 
given March 19, 1989; preparations started in February. McNamara, 
a saint, made the table (physical structure). Josephine brings in 
cut-dough, fig-filled ornaments made by Lina Abbate. Josephine: 
Money didn't matter...I was so thankful my son and my husband was 
better. I work at a grocery store, and every day would buy 
something (for the table). Josephine worked with Lina Abbate on 
the ornaments. 
Anthony: this is an art, really,  you don't just 
learn, you know. Little basket and rooster/### 
SIDE II 
Not familiar with putting fig-dough peacocks on the table ... every 
city is a little different. 
Refers to album again. Saint Joseph's cane, rosary, hand. Made a 
frame out of dough, with "San Giuseppe, Giuse, Maria" written. 
For two months we had a lot of people in the house. Lina Abbate 
is from Sicily too. Josephine worked on the table before and 
after work. Talk about friends, the Morellos. 
Album: Makinq Saint Joseph bread--vuccidati. Used bakery at King 
Soopers (grocery store), where Josephine works. Used 50 pounds of 
flour for the bread; each bread weighs 2.5 pounds. 
This is the different trittate--favis, peas, cardunas, 
cauliflower, asparagus. Three frittate of each kind, in graduated 
sizes. Son's godmother took a day off from work just to help: 
Mary Ann Giaratono (?).

time, Josephine prepared boxes with a few of each kind of coof". 
Vuccidata -- Saint Joseph 's bread, one orange. 
Tradition of giving out a dry fava? Josephine : that was a long 
time ago, more like a friendship thing (not a Saint Joseph's Day 
tradition), but don't know much about it.

and Sunday morning to visit. Priest came on Sunday. 
Orange , sweet anise, bread--filling the table. Photo of Anthony 
and Vincent on the table. Always a Bible cake and a fish. 
V Pignolati a tradition ; made of flour, wheat. Probably have a 
meaning. Haven''tt heard

hey represents the pine cones that 
Baby Joseph played with it. Papacolova  
(dough birds with Pggs-set 
in their chests), Lamb cake. So much, they set »p another table.

Oranges should be there because arancia is the fruit of Sicily. 
There's a song "Arancia di Sicilia." Sacred Heart of figs; upside 
down because it was so heavy , the point was breaking . Made by 
Mrs. Abbate. 
Vincent (son) didn't say much. Liked to see it done, but didn't 
grow up with it like we did it Sicily. Enthused but didn't know 
what to think ... lack of privacy because so many people. 
Fish made of figs ; fig ornaments called vudureddi (spelling). 
Held in living room. Basket filled with bread; gave sick people 
who came a bread. Tables set 11p in garage, outside --fed about 300

People say they never saw a table like that. Josephine: I made 
everything ... Leftover food brought to the soup kitchen, mission, 
Salvation Army . Gave everything away, didn't want anything, no 
money. I just did it cause I was so thankful that Saint 
Joseph ... my husband and my son . We grew up like that. A lot of 
work , money --but worth it. A pillow for ?; wheat ; giglio. People 
donated a lot. This ... a doll my mother sent my children. I put

saint on a pedestal, go  through the city, fireworks; collect

fireworks; the priest; everyone contributes. Biq celebration with 
a mass. At the end, the fireworks from a hillside outside of the

SIDE 1 
Introduction. 
In the section below, Rose Nigro, Frank Nigro and JoAnna 
participate. 
Saint Joseph's Table: 
Rose speaking with interjections from Frank and JoAnna. 
Rose learned about the tradition in Pueblo. Wanted to have the 
table because her daughter was sick. 
People taught her what to 
do. Made three tables. First one was in 1943. Had another one in 
1946. Another one maybe in 1955. 
The first one for daughter Stella who had injured her hip in a 
horse accident; accident happened in Walsenberg. Second table for 
Mike, son in Korea (unsure). One in 1951? 
IAW-PM-A007 -

Learned from Mrs. Zinno, who was from near Naples. Learned the 
Saint Joseph table in Pueblo, on the Mesa. 
Move from Walsenberg to Pueblo 
Frank says they lived in Walsenburg first; had chickens but 
couldn't sell them there. Asked a friend, Jack Di Gioa (?) to 
look for a house in the country in Pueblo. Rented a house from 
the Zinno's. Fixed up a chicken coop. Was barbering on the air 
base. Frank got sick in Walsenburg; doctor advised him to move to 
a lower elevation because of his heart. 
Saint Joseph Day: 
People who represented saints? Poor people, sick people—who 
claimed miracles. We still believe. Heard about people, some 
strangers, some family. 
Today the people asked to be saints are known to the families? 
JoAnna: Mostly because there is no orphanage; sick people. Table 
open to the public. 
How many people came in the old days? 
Over 700 one time. Made a lot of cookies. 
Did they reenact Mary and Joseph's search for the inn? 
No, we invi tR- 
p-n 
,.- 
nt 
Joseph day broke the table... saints ate first. 
Saints were children or adults? 
Mixed... depended on who needed it ... table blessed. No rosary at 
her table, but JoAnna says some had rosaries. Rose attended a 
table at Anna Costanza's ... Rose was a saint ... Saint Ann. 
JoAnna: have Saint Ann, Joseph, Mary, Joseph. 
Do you thing the tradition has changed? 
Today they go more for luxury. In old days, more the saints, 
candles, flowers ... more elaborate, more the same... decorate 
more... like an altar. 
Did you have a statue or picture of Saint Joseph? 
Got it from the neighborhood... in the country they are more 
religious. They have all kinds of different statues. The 
Sicilians believe in that. 
In Calabria, did your town have a patron saints? 
A procession every week... in the summer. We have a procession at 
Our Lady of Assumption Church (at Mount Carmel too). Around the 
block ... music. Do it today. Say the rosary but don't sing like we 
used to do. Feast Day of the Assumption is August 15. Mostly 
IAW-PM-A007 -

Italians in the procession. 
Do you know anyone who has old photographs? 
We have one from the Zinno's ... Stella has it. 
Stella had a dislocated hip; was in the hospital a few months. 
Still suffers from it. 
The table was made in order to? 
It helped... she walks, had a family. 
Can have an altar to ask for help  
or thank Saint Joseph. Some 
people go around and ask ... depends on how you offer ... Ask him to 
intercede for help from Our Loving Father. 
Rose used to say prayers in Italian ... now more in English. 
Children know a little Italian. Virginia talked beautifully, 
Stella talks good ... Mike, Eva and JoAnna not too good. Six 
children. 
Did you have a corredo with you when you came from Italy? 
I brought some with me ... used scarfs and embroidered cut-work 
pillow covers on the table. Has her-wedding dress. 
Marriage/Birthdays: 
Married in Grimaldi, provincia di Costanz4. Frank and Rose born 
in t e same 
ouse; 
a in the same house for a while. He came 
to the United States, she stayed in Italy. Frank went back to get 
her. She was 3 or 4 years old when Frank left; in 1914, she was 
7. Rose born 1907; Frank born January 1, 1902, or December 31,

Their children do tables? 
Frank Di Gioa did one; they own Gaetano's. 
Bill Reininger asks Rose if she is ready; Rose leaves to change 
for a doctor's appointment. JoAnna has to leave soon too; calls 
her sister Stella to come over. 
Immigration history: 
Frank cQntinues his story of his birth. In 1926, when he went 
back to the old country, Rose's mother (who delivered Frank) 
said, "If I knew you were going to take away my daughter, I would 
have thrown you to the hogs." Hogs under the house. 
Mother-in-law was Mariauzza Pietramale; her husband Pietro. 
Frank's father, Michele Nigro, born in Grimaldi; doesn't know 
about mother, Fortunata Presta, some Presta in Canada. Father 
came to Colorado in 1904; worked in the mines then raised stock; 
made cheese. His uncle came too, between Walsenburg and Trinidad, 
in Hastings. Was in an explosion in the mines. 
Work for ten cents an hour. Came straight to Colorado from New 
York. Mother's brother was here working in  the mines; sent for 
Frank's father. Father went into ranching, homestead in 
Walsenburq, Huerfano County. Frank's father left family in Italy; 
family left Grimaldi March 28, 1914. Boarded a German ship, 
called a fuoco; boarded in Naples. Landed April 14; one day 
before Easter but couldn't land because it was Easter. Checked 
passports, destinations, etc. Medical examinations. Came with a 
mother and two sisters Josephine and Mary; sister in Washington 
state. From New York to Colorado. Mary came in 1913 (not with the 
others) to marry Frank's wife's brother who was in Washington; he 
had a saloon in Spokane. Father at the ranch when he called for 
the family. Cows, sheep and dairy qoats for Romam cheese.  
Ranch in Walsenburg: 
Mostly Spanish neighbors and Italians from Tyrol (Andreatta). 
IAW-PM-A007 -

Didn't go to school; only one year in Italy; could read and 
write. Tried to run away from a girl (teacher) who gave 
dictation; he liked her. A teacher hit him in the head; never 
went back. 
JoAnna shows a photo of Uncle Carl when he got married in 1944 or 
45. Shows Rose Nigro's citizenship document from 1961; had to 
learn to read and write first; went to night school. (Rose 
leaves). Fran 
was a citizen un er 
is father; because he was 
under 21 he automatically became a citizen. 
Work in Italy? 
Frank was a stone mason helper when he was 8 or 9 years old in 
Italy. Mother was sick a lot. 
On the ranch, father peddled stuff. Frank milked and took care of 
the animals. Father butchered the hogs; Frank too. Story of going 
to the Andreatta; they tried to kill a hog with a .22. Frank 
tells them how Calabrese do it--stick it and bleed it. Our way--
Calabrese. Describes how they killed hogs. Made sausage, salami, 
ham and bacon 
One year Frank killed L5 hogs for the famyil. 
Mom helped in the fields too? 
Raised cicirro, fagioli, piselli, lettuce. Peddled ricotta and 
puina (Tyrolian word); Greeks say myzthera. Mother, father and 
Frank helped. Mother took care of the house. Sisters married 
Italians in the US. 
Went back to Italy to marry Rose? 
Frank's sister Mary married Rose's brother. Frank went to visit 
Mary and her husband, they told him they were going to send for 
his wife. Asked if that was okay. Sent word that Frank wanted 
Rose; Frank remembered her; Rose only remembered him playing in 
the straw and he would sell hazelnuts so he could buy candy for 
the kids (names them). 
Rose -and Frank—exchanged pictures; he was 20, 21 and Rose  
was 15 
or  16. She didn't want to come (didn't want to leave the mother). 
War broke out in 1921. People started coming, quotas. So 1926, he 
went to Italy for Rose. Got married and came straight to 
Colorado. Stella was born in Spokane. Mary says Stella born at 
her house, on the farm. 
Stayed in Walsenburg until 1927, then moved to Spokane; father 
sold the farm. Didn't like the farm in Washington; had less 
freedom, acres. Wanted to raise stock. Returned to Colorado/###

Frank offers wine, coffee, food. That's how the Italian people 
are. Compares Italians to some Germans he knew in Walsenburg. The 
Mexican people were poor; depended on "us." Frank was sick once, 
the Mexicans came over and planted his crops for them. Italians 
and Americans wouldn't do it. Flavored liquor offered to Germans 
who came by their house; offered them white whiskey flavored like 
in the old country. Frank had bottles of different kinds in

pounds of flour at a time. Make the bread in the house; started 
fire after bread finished; checking oven by pulling ashes out; 
cooled oven with a mop; testing the heat of the oven; baking the 
bread. Frank made the oven; on the ranch near Walsenburg. Made of 
bricks with a cement base, filled with sand.

Saint Joseph's Day: 
Photo of Saint Joseph's Day Table given by Rose Dazzio in 1979 by 
Annabelle's mother, Rose Dazzio (Ann's sister). Rose and Ann are 
sisters of Charles Musso (see files). 
Photo taken on the Mesa on a Saint Joseph's Day at the home of 
Rose Dazzio and her husband. The table was given for him; had 
many problems; died of brain cancer in 1985. This one was the 
second one; did one practically overnight, but came out pretty 
big. 
Ann remembers a table from when she was 5 or 6 on the Mesa, where 
her family grew vegetables for sale. Dad peddled with a horse and 
wagon. Kids up at 3 am, and worked all day. Eleven children; lost 
three. Older sister active in Saint Joseph's Day. Had goats, made

cheese, ricotta. 
Immigration history in Louisiana and Pueblo: 
Grandparents and parents from Lucca Sicula. Asks Paula Manini to 
read two passages from the Libro D'Oro (1904--see project's 
files) about her family. Manini reads entries about Giovanni 
Musso (Ann's father), and his father Salvatore Musso (Ann's 
grandfather). 
Ann: trying to trace the roots. Has called Texas and Louisiana 
looking for relatives, but did not have any luck. 
Annabelle's grandmother: her grandmother was a Russo sister. 
Ann: trying to figure out information about another brother of 
the father and grandfather; someone in the family says there was 
another brother. 
Italian language use: 
No one speaks Italian in the family; lost after Ann's parents 
died. 
Saint Joseph's Day Tables: 
Ann: now we use crepe paper, used to decorate it with sheets or 
bedspreads. Ann and her sisters ... used crocheted bedspreads with 
colored sheets or paper underneath. My mother used to put her 
pillow cases, from when—she was married, on the table. Things 
from her mother's hope chests. 
Annabelle: mother still has her things; still has a bashi (?) 
hung in a diamond shape. Ann brings in a pillow case. 
Ann: used to  make lamb cakes by hand instead of molds. Annabelle 
shows a picture of a lamb made from dough. Tables always r 
sed 
ik 
le an altar; call it a table, with an altar on it. 
Ann's family went to Saint Joseph's Church in the "Grove." Father 
Giglio used to bless the table. 
Shows lamb cake molds she bought in Pueblo; frosted with 
coconut. 
Working on the farm/making bread in the forno: 
Annabelle worked on the farm too. 
Ann's parents used Sicilian a lot; Dad used English a lot too. 
IAW-PM-A010 -

Remembers her mother studying for her citizenship. 
Values of working hard, tell the truth. 
Ann's mother bore all the children in the house. Part of the 
house still stands; sister-in-law still lives there. Shed in the 
back says Musso Produce. 
Had a forno. Used 50 pounds of flour per week, 28 loaves; had to 
get up at 1:30 a.m. 
Ann's grandfather lived with them for 14 
years. Made the starter the night before with yeast, flour, 
sugar; next morning mix with water. Took muscles to knead it; did 
it twice. Big oven outside. Ann's mother knew exactly how much 
heat needed; tested heat with a newspaper. Girls helped, not 
boys. Baked breads for the first Saint Joseph's Day table in the 
oven. 
Saint Joseph's Day Table: 
Always had lady fingers, pignolata, spinghi, brownies, vucidati. 
At first, the promise was to humble themselves and go out and ask 
for donations. We'd get in the car and go house to house, to 
Italian people. People would give eggs, flour, milk, money, etc. 
Lot of relatives and friends. 
The saints at the table chosen because they are ill, or have been 
cured, or because they were poor. Naich Cordo's (see files) 
mother was a hard worker for the Saint Joseph's Day Table; Naich 
has been a saint; was this year at the Martellaro's table (see 
files); Naich Cordo married to Ann's cousin Pauline Musso. 
In the early years, mostly Sicilian did the tables? Mrs. Vance 
(?) was Abruzzesi used to have or help with tables. 
Ann: this was in the paper. This is Naich Cordo's late wife, 
Pauline. We made the bread ... whose table was it? Annabelle: this 
was the year my mother had her table too--1978 or 79. Photo taken 
at the bakery--names people in the photo. 
This year--made bread at Zoelmann's Bakery. Owner Chuch 
Martinelli. 
Annabelle: this photo taken when they were making the bread for 
my mother's table. 
Looking at other photos/news articles. Talking about arranging 
the table. Annabelle: now they pretty much follow a picture (for 
arranging the table). 
Have to have fish on the table. Used to put rice with saffron; Jo 
Martellaro did not have it; told her ... the melanese (?), the 
anchovies with the finocchio. It's in a can ... mix it with the 
IAW-PM-A010 - 
4 
sauce to put over the spaghetti. Meatless. Fish, vegetables, 
asparagus, favis for omelets. 
Annabelle: we don't use meat, but up in Denver they do--roast 
beef, turkey. Friends of her daughter in Denver ... Our Lady of 
Immaculate Mary... asked daughter to put a table together; had 
seen one she had. The Caruso's and Rotolo's. Daughter is Jeanine 
Passy (?). I don't think they should serve meat, but they do... 
Cross and Chalice should be on the table, if you can. This is 
Frannie Musso who really started the Chalice. Made of fig. 
Image of Saint Joseph. Ann: my mother had one; mother had 
promised a diamond ring to Saint Joseph; and always kept it on 
the picture she had. Annabelle: my mother still has her picture. 
Now they have Bible cake. Breads with eggs, called Easter bread. 
Annabelle: my mother was the one who started making the Praying 
Hands. Ann's daughter Joanne Curry made the Head of Jesus for the 
first time. There's the wheat, Saint Joseph's cane. Several kinds 
of omelets. 
Have you heard of giving fava beans away? Annabelle heard of 
someone who did that, one of them from Italy. Maybe Ann Costanza. 
Photo album: 
Ann: the flood in 1921; Ann born that year. 60th wedding 
anniversary of Mr. and Mrs. John Musso. Mother born in Lucca 
Sicula, came here when she was 10 years old with her brother and 
her dad, to keep house for them. Never did go back; Ann's 
grandmother would send wheat, candy every year. Lace tablecloth 
my grandmother had sent her (Ann's mother); put on the table last 
year; probably over 100 years old. 
Weddings: 
Ann's parents married in Pueblo at Mount Carmel Church; all 
eleven (children) married there. Ann belongs to Saint Therese's 
now because of location. She had an Italian wedding... sandwiches, 
spaghetti and meatballs; sandwiches and peanuts put in bushels 
and passed. My mother had a long kitchen; dance there in that 
kitchen; butchered the cow, and cook for three days; three day 
celebration; they played accordion (Sam Ferraro) and banjo (Nick 
Costa). Danced the Italian scozze, tarantella at Ann's wedding; 
still dance it at weddings once in a while but they are getting 
away from it. 
Sandy: about her wedding; no one requested Italian songs. 
Annabelle: Bernie German played at our wedding; music was

Italian, Bojon. In the 1950's. Had an Italian wedding. 
Ann and Annabelle: Had almond candies at the wedding. Would throw 
the almond candies during the first dance, and money, pennies and 
nickels. The dollar dance. Threw the almonds when they left.

Ann: photo of her family (names people); taken at her parent's 
house on 25th Lane on the Mesa in about 1958. 
Table her mother promised but died before she could do it; 
brother did it for her.

down from generation to generation. 
Picture of the brothers and sisters and some of their kids; taken 
on same day as one above, in 1958. 220 people in the family; want 
to have a reunion this year. Many still in Pueblo. 
Sandy: I don't want to leave Pueblo... scenery... nicer here... love 
it. 
Ann: photo of man from New York visiting Dave D'Amato; family of 
18 children. 
Bessie Ingo, Ann's sister, had a table last year. 
Annabelle: have Praying Hands my mother made at home. Other 
souvenirs from the Saint Joseph's Day table. Varnished some of 
the breads. 
Saint Joseph's Day Table:

Ann: in those days, they gave sugar, flour, eggs. A lot of people 
promised and set money on the table. 
Annabelle: some people want to do that all on their own, but 
people give money. 
Tables in churches? 
Ann: doesn't know how or why it started, but it's fine. 
Annabelle: some people sell food off of the table to make money 
for the church... 
Ann: that's not a gift... 
How would you sum up the tradition, it's essence? 
Ann: it's something you've done with all your heart and 
regardless of the work, you don't mind it. It's just putting your 
whole heart in it. 
Annabelle: and if it's a promise you made, I think you should

played horseshoes and bocce. 
Ann and Annabelle: we never got gifts--once a celluoid doll--

people. Built a child's playhouse for daughter, and for the 
church (raffled). 
Saint Joseph's Day Table/Festivals:

mother; started building tables for friends too. Mother had a 
Saint Joseph's Day Table in about 1930-32. 
Used to have festivals on the next street over in Pueblo; mother 
helped with baking and cookies. 
The Sicilians mostly made the Saint Joseph's Day table. But 
Spanish people made them when they saw ours. Niece, Spanish, had 
one; others too. Lived in a mixed Italian and Spanish 
neighborhood in Blende and around Curry Street in town. 
A street over from Curry, they'd have processions, dances, 
IAW-PM-A012 - 
4 
meatballs, games. Did it before any of the churches. Then the 
churches started having them, brought in money. 
Procession with the saint; walked along the blocks; around Curry 
Street and Eldorado. For Our Lady of... can't think of it. In mid-
August. Maybe Our Lady of the Assumption. Remembers it when he 
was 15 or 16. Mostly Italians, some Spanish people. 
Christmas/Music: 
Christmas Eve his brother Benny would go around playing the 
accordion. People would give them food. 
They all played the accordion, Louie too. Guitar too. A brother 
in Chicago, a music teacher, played Italian songs. A nephew, Joe 
Saverino, plays the organ and the accordion. Used to play at 
Italian weddings. One guy plays, a group called the Music Makers, 
play at the Eagle Club. Almost all Italians. Elderly people love 
them. 
Tranni's (now Riggio's) used to have Italian music. 
Looks at a schedule from the Eagle's Club. A lot of old Italians 
go to these dances; people in their 50s, 60s, 70s. Sit at tables 
and talk. People from Italy go there; moved here right after the 
war. 
Saint Joseph's Day Table: 
Mother had one... practically ever year... for health, just used to 
make them ... to thank Saint Joseph for whatever. During the 
Depression, going to the fire station for beans and bacon; and 
had to work picking up trash... in 1929, 30. 
A neighbor, a cousin, Mrs Vasellari (?) used to have one even if 
it was a small one; a big one if there was a sickness in the 
family. There were quite a few around town. Just the elderly 
helped. 
Dad talked to him in Italian; I knew what he was saying. Mother 
spoke broken Italian. Can speak it good now; can speak Spanish. 
Wife was Spanish mix. 
Dance places/gang fights/ethnic groups: 
Loves to dance ... cha cha, jitterbug, whatever. Other dance 
places: Tranni's, Arcadia, Silver Slipper, clubs, beer joints. 
Some good fights ... Goat Hill gang, the Northside, Bojon Town 
across the bridge ... about four or five ... once had a big fight on 
the lake. Didn't want you on their territory. Mexican, Italian, 
Austrian, each had their gangs, and territory. Didn't get

along ... at first it was bad. People in their 20s. When Joe was 
about 18, so in the mid-thirties. 
People started getting along better in the 40's ... with all the 
commotion with the war. People got closer together. 
Italians all got along ... used to go visit your neighbors. Italian 
people were closer. The Spanish people would send you something 
to eat ... helped each other out. 
Christmas/Food: 
Had baccala on Christmas Eve. Codfish with olives, celery; mother 
always had eggplants in crocks, cans stuffed ... kept in the 
basement. Made own sausage, wine. Son-in-law Gilbert Lopez still

Games/Entertainment: 
and on Easter and Christmas, we'd have dice games in the streets. 
Mother didn't like it. Played cards too; not Italian games. 
Played bocce on the street, around Curry Street. Horseshoes. Had 
some great times. 
We'd have some great times. The Italians would make their own 
foods, and then go up in the mountains. Go early, have breakfast. 
Cook spaghetti. My mother and sister would get groups. Used to 
love it. Went to Rye or Beulah. Spaghetti, meatballs, watermelon. 
On Fourth of July would go to City Park. 
Saint Joseph's Day Table: 
Last one we had was the Andalucci's (spelling), about five years 
ago. Thinks the tradition is dying out. Was surprised when a 
young couple did one recently. 
The tables have a lot of miracles. In my family there was quite a 
few. John had a table for a nephew who had a motorcycle accident. 
IAW-PM-A013 - 
2 
Mother made a table for John. He was in the hospital for a year 
when he was in the military. She made a table if he came home. 
Brother Lloyd was in a lot of battles in World War II; came out 
okay; mother had tables for him. 
Mother used to make tables just to make them; just to celebrate 
the feast day, even if it was a small one. Grandson got better 
and then sick again (son Gary Amella enters). 
Gary used to be one of the saints--apostles not saints. We'd eat 
first, then the ceremony itself. Remembers being served. He was 
Saint Christopher; John was Saint John. 
Most of the time they had people who were sick, or poor, or in 
need. Had from 4, to 6, to 12, once had 13. 
On the tables, sometimes had pictures of the people for whom they 
had they table. 
Had one for a cousin, Frankie Sirillo, who came home from 
Vietnam. Another table for a little cousin, 4 years old; Mom made 
a promise for her because she had a firecracker explode in her 
face. John set off a something, and before he turned around, she 
ran into it. I promised her if she was okay I would make a table 
for her. Dianna Concino. So many incidents. 
The purpose of the table is to offer a promise, and they usually 
come through. Gary never had a table. Mom and Dad were the 
individuals who had them. 
Hundreds of people would come ... they knew the Amellas. Tables 
ready by noon the day before Saint Joe's Day; fed them the next 
day. Spaghetti and stuff. Anyone who wanted to come ... put it in 
the paper. Italians would come. Could make contributions, money 
on the table. Many people donated cakes, flowers. Sometimes made 
a table where you didn't take donations. Can promise you can make 
it all yourself, or others can help. But people still help. John 
begged once or twice ... to your friends. Some brought flowers, 
sugar, money. One lady made all the bread for 13 saints; she 
lived on Curry; always contributed bread. 
Women do the baking. John helped with the cookies, the icing. But 
mostly the women. Men help with the spaghetti. Women did the 
meatballs. Both men and women served the apostle. Priest would 
come and bless the table before people ate. 
Belongs to Saint Joseph's Church. 
Men involved in building the table... 30 1 x 7' or 8'. In the 
churches have big spaghetti dinners as fundraisers; cookies; held 
in August. 
IAW-PM-AO13 - 
3 
Still a lot Italian functions, but it's all mixed too. Sometimes 
they have Mexican dinners too. 
A church (maybe Holy Rosary) on the north, west side ... use John's 
sheep, donkey and cross; freeze them. Donated heart, chalice. 
Gave it to them, and they started having the tables. John and his 
wife had a table in 1956. They used the stuff for two or three 
years; probably threw it away by now. 
Churches haven't had the tables for long. Way back, the churches 
didn't think much of the tables; figured the money should go to 
the church; like the festivals. Now people in the congregation 
help; makes money at these festivals. 
Food: 
Gary married a Spanish girl from Fort Collins; they get into the 
grain of things with the Italians. The Italians are so close-
knit, the other nationalities seem to melt in the pot with the 
Italians. She made pretty good spaghetti; a good cake. John's 
wife was English; she made good spaghetti, meatballs. Big 
spaghetti dinners. Like ravioli, lasagna. Anything else is an 
Americanization. 
Saint Joe's Church as a cookbook on Italian cooking. John bought 
one the other day and gave it to his daughter. Have Mexican 
recipes in it too. 
Ethnic composition of Pueblo: 
Italians, Mexicans and Bojon/Slays/Poles in Pueblo, and in the 
mills. Italians in the areas of the smelter and Goat Hill. 
Gary Amella: 
Gary directs Upward Bound at University of Southern Colorado; 
Masters from Colorado State University; taught in Denver. Came 
back to Pueblo--likes the type of people in Pueblo, friends, 
family/W## 
Gary: spaghetti every Sunday until Mom died. We carry that on 
too; we go to Giadone's on the Mesa.

SIDE I 
Phenomena of Saint Joseph's Day the United States in general. 
Saint Joseph's Day Table in Buffalo, New York had a different 
emphasis. In Pueblo, more emphasis on the persons involved. 
Has worked on the Mesa about a year; in Grand Junction before 
that; worked in Avondale previous to that; originally from 
Burlington, Vermont; seminary in Buffalo, New York. 
The church is more open in the west; wanted to come out to work 
in the west. 
Church's view of the Saint Joseph's Day Table: 
Grassroot beginnings to a lot of rituals; neat way to make the 
connection with life and God, and the two come together. It's 
neat that the Saint Joseph's tradition is coming back alive again 
because there's such a lack of connection between life's 
experiences and church. Anything that can happen on the home 
level is positive. 
Only caution is the teaching on the saints is not always what the 
IAW-PM-AO14 - 
2 
popular sense is; to view the saint as an intercessor as someone 
who prays on behalf of the Church versus someone who does the 
thing--Saint Joseph doesn't do this, God does it. 
People want to know if there is a ritual (for Saint Joseph's Day 
Tables). There is a blessing, official blessing, and other 
blessing books. Traditionally in the Italian home, the priest 
comes and blesses the food and the people ... so it's not really an 
official thing with the church--not an official ritual with the 
church--but a senses of things that have happened and blessings 
have been created to adapt to the rituals. 
For Saint Joseph, bless the food and give praise and thanksgiving 
for the favors, and the people gathered. 
Past intolerance of the church? 
Cautions about the magical sense where the saints do this, rather 
than God. 
The saints are people like us who have had experiences 
like us, who have made it to holiness and so they pray on our 
behalf. There's a real intimate connection with the people who 
have died and gone before us. That's the sense the church wants 
to get across. Some of the grassroot traditions don't always have 
that emphasis. Saints aren't the source of power. 
Communicate that through teaching. Met with the family 
(Martellaro's) this year, and in preaching. Talk about the 
characteristics of Joseph, and belief in saints in general, and 
what the Church teaches ... but some people still believe it's the 
santos who do it. Rooted in Italian and Spanish beliefs. 
Has been involved with two tables in Buffalo, one on the Mesa in 
Pueblo. The one in Buffalo had open house, blessing of food--here 
the emphasis on a particular person--there it's not, it's a 
general kind of Italian celebration where the family gathers 
together and gives thanks for all the favors and blessings. Here 
it's oriented toward a particular person, or whose journey has 
been affected by Saint Joseph's intercession, so they give the 
table on behalf of that person. 
Here a lot of food given to poor, soup kitchens. Far removed now 
from when they would invite the poor in. In Buffalo, they invited 
people from the soup kitchens in to eat at the table. There's a 
collection given to the poor, but its original purpose was to 
feed the poor. 
Like the Last Supper? 
More oriented like that here, the numbers (of saints). In 
Buffalo, didn't invite "saints." Here they have the open house 
and the meal separately. In Buffalo, an open house with people 
coming through and eating all day. Here, more sense ritual here 
in the sense of how they do it. 
IAW-PM-A014 -

At the Martellaro's this year: 
First day to bless the table itself and the food; happened before 
all else. 
Second day to bless the meal and the people on the actual feast 
day. 
For the open house I was there for an hour after the blessing. 
On the second day, stayed from 12:00 until 2:00 or 3:00 pm. As 
they served, they described all the food. 
Spent time talking with the people; a very social event. I wasn't 
involved in the inside. Mostly talked about the table and food. 
Had never eaten some of the food, some of the vegetables. 
In Buffalo, all the food goes to the poor. 
Other priests from the church associated with the tradition? 
Not sure. Martellaro's not from Saint Joseph's Church. Not aware 
of other families who have done it, or priests, in the parish. 
Other priests supportive; had heard of the tradition but had not 
been involved in it. Mostly Italian people...Jesuits founded the 
church. Father Murray, Father Glen Mueller. 
Other folk religious practices in the area? 
Italians especially fond of Saint Anthony and Saint Joseph. 
Wasn't aware of observations for Saint Lucy. Big spaghetti dinner 
once a year. Italian cookies big. At the festival in August, 
they'll have a big booth. The spaghetti dinner started as a fund 
raiser. A couple of old Italian recipe have always done the 
recipe. Parish half Italian and half Spanish; Spanish becoming 
involved in the spaghetti dinner. Now a blending of Italian and 
Spanish traditions. Used to be the Italians owned the land, and 
Spanish worked it. 
Special blessings in this agricultural community? 
Blessing of the fields for Saint Isidore, patron saints of the 
farmers. More Hispanic than Italian. Mass in the fields after the 
planting. Has been picked up by the Italian people. 
I think its a wonderful tradition... church has a rich sense of 
using symbols and things that are in life and connecting with 
God ... any ritual that can happen in the home among the people is 
beautiful and powerful... have lost a lot of these 
traditions—but the importance of connecting peoples lives with 
God and ritualizing that is powerful and good 
Cross over Spanish and Italian—marriages ... blending of 
styles/###

SIDE I 
About a trip to California. 
Saint Joseph's Day Table/Farming: 
Pictures of the tables. Has done it for a gad sixty years. Born 
February 14, 1909. Always lived to bake. Made cream puffs when 
she was ten years old, and her mother brought some to Mrs. De 
Salvo, and from that day made them every Sunday. 
Living out in the farm. Learned to bake on her own; cake 
decorating by herself. Everything on made on a coal stove. Lived 
a couple of places on the Mesa. Helped mother with the tables. 
Parents Rose and John Musso. Mother did a lot of promising ... a 
big family and sick. Other Italians would call for them to help--
the Cordos and Buffalos. Sisters helped ... Rose Dazzio mostly. 
Now they make more cookies. Then we had specialized in Italian 
cookies for Saint .Toseph's. Even now, she won't freeze anything 
ah 
e a
d 
in preparation). 
Other food on the table? 
Grew a lot of the vegetables, except artichokes and things you 
couldn't get in March. Cousin in California sent artichokes or 
anise ... one year sent flowers 
Worked in the fields from when 
IAW-PM-AO15 -

young. 
The Farm: 
Baking big tubs of bread when 10 in fornos, made 20, 30 built the 
fornos. Jack Genoble (?) built one on this land. Farm used to be 
14 acres. 
When married, land belonged to them... four partners working 
together, her husband's brothers Sam and Fred and her husband 
Tony ... mother-in-law was the boss ... they worked. All living in 
different houses but eating and cooking in one house and also a 
summer kitchen. 
Trip to Lucca Sicula/Family in Italy: 
In-laws are Rose and Salvatore Ingo from Lucca Sicula. Bessie 
still has relations there; she went there six years ago. 
Describes the homes: marble; inside bathrooms now. Her mother's 
mother was a mid-wife; stayed in Italy. Everyone related or close 
friends. 
Saint Joseph's Day Table in Lucca Sicula: 
Some people do the Saint Joseph's Day Table--but different. Plain 
spaghetti and rice. Just a few things, not elaborate. Flat table 
with stuff on it. Just found out you can make a Saint Joseph's 
Day Table anytime, not just March 19. But to us, always March 19; 
should be—that way. 
Saint Joseph's Day Table: 
First one she remembers were of the parents, and aunts and 
uncles. Decorations were different--fancy crocheted bedspreads 
for the sides. She has done this. Three girls had the same 
bedspreads, and they'd use them; had a peach undercloth. 
Crochet/Stories from father-in-law/Priests: 
Mother taught them to crochet when they were little. Dad used to 
tell a few stories; father used to be story-teller; told stories 
of what he and two friends (one a priest) used to do; knew all 
the saints days but wouldn't go to church because he knew what 
they priests did. Father-in-law would set the kids on his lap and 
tell them stories; spoke in Italian. 
Language use: 
Daughter Rose talks Italian; son Sam understands it but won't 
IAW-PM-A015 -

talk it; daughter Ruth understood a few things; things started 
changing going to school. Daughter Rose and niece Annabelle Di 
Iorio speak it. 
Immigration from Lucca/Buying land in Pueblo: 
Mother 10 years when she came to America; her two brothers were 
here; sisters came too. Never saw her mother again. Would buy 
land a piece at a time. Father's father and mother was from the 
northern part of Italy; he was a farmer too. Salvatore Musso went 
to Lucca from the northern part of Italy. But doesn't know much 
about it. 
Saint Joseph's Day Table: 
Mother had one when Bessie's Dad was sick (and a sister too); 
daughter went to California for three months on the doctor's 
orders. Had a table for him. Sickness of the kids, mostly her 
sister. Mother had a good four tables, plus friends and relatives 
had tables too. 
SIDE II 
Saint Joseph's Day Table: 
This generation, lot don't understand it or too busy. Sam Ingo, 
her son, and Annabelle Di Iorio, they do it. 
In the old days, made certain cookies ahead--honey balls, ribbon 
cookies. Worked in steps. Put in cans and stored in cool places. 
Last things were the fried vegetables for the omelets (frittate). 
Sometimes she would make a small table without a promise. 
Reliqious images on the table. Oen 
painting hang;nri ;n the 
bedroom; picture must be old.  Looking at a photo done in 1976 for 
Bessie Ingo when she had surgery; given by her and her sister, 
Rose. Made a table last year for sister Rose and Dorothy. Dominic 
has a table promised; so might have one for him. 
Did breads for Josephine Martellaro. 
Made for daughter Ruth Ingo, who had polio, in 1952. Same old 
painting used. Referring to cut-dough fig-filled ornaments; 
freeze them now but not in the old days. Only can freeze them for 
a year. She made 
read for  Josephine Gagliano's table--palm 
leaf, fish, Moon. Made the bre d at Zoelmann's Bakery for 
Josephine Martellaro's table. In the old days, used to eat the 
fig-filled symbols. 
Describes how she makes the  fig ornaments. Only two of us could 
IAW-PM-AO15 -

do it--Bessie and Sandy Musso. Trying to teach her daughter, but 
thinks it's too much work; and need the talent. 
Photo from 1976 table--names everything on the table. 
Father Mueller was the priest from Saint Joseph's Church. Shows 
copy of an article from the Pueblo Chieftain. 
Names types of bread. They all 
items on the table. 
g. Placement of 
People bring things if they made a promise they would. Can 
promise to help out or donate anything. 
Begged for donations the year her daughter was sick. You can't 
afford it but you want to do it. Give goods or money. 
A lot of work--but when it's over, it's such a relief and you 
aren't even tired. It's like a friendly get-together. Just some 
older people do it now. 
People are open more now with it. Tell more people about it; 
doesn't take long to have 1,000 people. She has had as many as 
2,000. Make a certain amount of cookies; never ran out. 
Announcements in the newspaper about when she was making them; in 
the 1950's. Then more people would come; curious. You have to see 
a table because you can't imagine it. Will sit for hours and look 
and talk, asking about things. A11 ethnic groups came; everyone 
let in. It's all onn rnr3, 
and_ people are all the same. 
Saint Joseph is a hard-working saint, and a healer. And Saint 
Jude. You promise to Saint Joseph; gives an example. 
Has statues of saints in the house; Last Supper. Lights candles 
all the time; 10 day candles and the little votive candles. Prays 
and say the rosary. Mother and mother-in-law too; mother-in-law 
always had a rosary with her. Always buries a rosary with the 
deceased. 
Painting given to her 
mother-in-law. Bessie was with her 
in 
ause aking care of her. 
Signs from Saint Joseph? Who remembers?

SIDE I 
Differences in arrangement of the table. Old days, tables weren't 
as balanced, symmetrical. Changes started with the Musso family; 
and then copied. The girls did it. Bedrunners. Still has 
everything as keepsakes. 
People chosen to represent the saints--sick people. 
Number of 
people selected--have to have an odd number. Has had as many as 
21. Has a saint book. Never had less than 13 people as saints. 
The 13 Apostles, to keep it with the odd numbers. Can have any 
saints though. Got to have the Holy Family, and then any others. 
All the saints represent something--reads through that book. Most 
of the names of people are from the saints. 
Bessie is named after a great-grandmother Felicia--don't know how 
they got Bessie. 
How to choose the saints--go through the book and decide. 
"Heavenly Friends: A Saint for Each Day." So many saints. Book 
gives the dates too. Looks for Saint Joseph's Day--wonders and 
miracles. Saint Joseph and Saint Jude helps your family, do the 
miracles, when you pray to them? Yes. Continues to look through 
the book. 
Tries to go to church on certain saints days? I try to but it's 
IAW-PM-A016 - 
2 
hard now. Doesn't go to church during the week unless its a 
special day or a funeral ? Prays every night and morning... says 
everything . Prays to the saints- -Joseph , Jude , Mother Cabrini. 
Each has their own prayer . Shrine to Mother Cabrini in Colorado. 
Says a little prayer, and then says "Saint Joseph pray for me." 
Used to have Christmas at her house all the time . But now goes to 
her children 's house. 
There used to be a lot of beets . Garden farming is vegetables. 
Bessie picked , hulled, everything else. A lot of canning. Still 
cans things she can't get in the stores. 
Makes canonatis -- egg 
p 1 ant -,tomatoes 
olives, celery . Can use it 
on the Saint Joseph Table because there 's no meat. Can't have 
meat because-it! 
s Lent_ 
Some people have started to use meat; has been to a couple in 
Pueblo. Eat caponata on spaghetti or as an appetizer. Some 
Spanish people , a lady in Blende , Maybelle Casino, had meat. I've 
heard of some others . For my sense , I don't believe in it. Our 
folks started it that way, and we followed it. Other foods 
Maybelle Casino had? Bessie made the little lambs, the heart. 
Mexican food on the table? I didn't go because it was a different 
thing... really small ... just a corner ... being a different 
nationality. What about Josephine , she's Slovenian? But she did 
it like we 're supposed to... followed her husband 's tradition. 
Maybelle Casino--I think she saw a table and just didn't know 
much about it. 
Variation okay in decoration , up to the individual. What cannot 
change? Meatless ? Saints? Odd number of saints? Always have an 
odd number of people as saints. 
Can't have a soft flour for brear3 (the Saint Toss•h Da••araad)__ 
used to 
just a hard flour , Major Cee's. Minnesota hard flour. 
Growing wheat for thable? Put it in little pots until 6 "  high. 
It's the staff of life; if it wasn 't for wheat couldn't have 
bread. 
The table a representation of the Last Supper? I would say it 
started like that. 
Know of tradition of re -enacting when Mary and Joseph looking for 
lodging at an inn? No. 
Saints wearing costumes? No. 
Had Naich Cordo as a saint once . The Buffalos ... we helped them. 
Wouldn't believe a lot of these Italian names. 
IAW-PM-A016 -

Who built the underneath part of the table at your mother's 
tables? Saw horses built by men; women did everything else. 
Daughter-in-law Dorothy and daughter Ruth did a lot of 
decoration; had a decorator one time ... a man ... had to pay 
him/### 
SIDE II 
Saint Joseph's Day Table 
...if there wasn't anyone to do it, had to hire 
someone... wouldn't put the food on the table... lot easier to hire 
a decorator... blue paper on the ceiling for the sky. 
Other important colors? 
Sun rays in yellow in this one. Can use any color you like. 
"Saint Joseph Pray for Us" across the top; Dorothy did most of 
that one; no date on it. Did it for Robert Roderick, son-in-law, 
husband of Rose; had pneumonia. 
Face of Jesus by Joanne Massarotti Drury, her sister Ann's 
daughter (see files). 
When things don't work (prayers not answered), what do you think? 
Can't do anything... other things come up... so what can you do? I 
had promised last year for my daughter-in-law... looking at a 
newspaper article with Father Mueller in it. 
Italians in New York and California. Some (tables) done in 
restaurants or churches. What do you think of the ones in the 
churches? It's okay. 
Priests involvement? Blessing, pray. 
Remember tables where the said rosaries many nights before? I 
imagine so...mother-in-law prayed all the time. 
Blessing of the fields: 
Blessing of the fields at your farm? 
Against storms, like that. Come and bless your home. Had her home 
blessed ... to make sure... everything goes well... Father Mueller 
would come every first Friday of the month and give her communion 
and pray, bless the house ... Maybe some still bless the 
fields ... we did a few times... parents too... 
Have you heard of Saint Isidro, for the farmers? Probably is one 
IAW-PM-AO16 - 
4 
like that ... in-laws used to mention the saints ... father-in-law 
knew all the saints ... he was from Lucca , all parts in 
there ... Palermo, Rome , all parts in there ... like in the Mesa 
Trip to Lucca/Italian use/Ethnic groups and intermarriage: 
[,-
Stayed with a cousin ; uncle had passed away a few months 
before ... write to cousin who was supposed to come ... write a few 
words in Italian ... speaks a few words to her sister "Che 
fai?" ... spoke more when parents and in-laws were alive ... Paula 
Manini speaks to Bessie in Italian ... a lot of Calabresi around 
here ... Did you know the Nigros ? Yes, from when my Dad was at 
home . In those days , a lot of Italians ... they were all friends, 
respected each other. 
Discrimination? A lot of Italians married Bojon girls. Talks 
about ethnic intermarriage among friends and families ... when she 
was a girl, parents probably wouldn't have let her marry a non-
Italian... attitudes changed right after that... after the war. But 
not wit my folks, not mixed. 
Bessie and Tony Ingo 's Marriage/Marriages today: 
Married at Mount Carmel ; reception at her parents' home... long 
kitchen ... had a band... someone to cook ... butcher a cow for the 
meatballs and stew meat ... Mr. Thomas Palmilio (?), a good cook, 
one of the few who would do it ... cook meat in the outside 
ovens ... rolled meats ... John Faro (?) played the accordion ... waltz 
and stuff ... tarantella ... lot of fun ... peanuts, almonds, candy 
bought by the 100 pounds and served in trays ... cigars for the 
men. 
VV 
Have you ever heard of bomboniere? Paula Manini: Confetti is 
almonds tied up in netting, bomboniere are little gifts for the 
guests . Still has confetti from a cousin 's wedding in Italy ... she 
didn't go though ... In those days didn't have the wedding 
march ... now they have dollar dance with a box for the 
money ... throw money , pennies and nickels ... not rice anymore... 
My folks gave us a hope chest with the linens, most  
I 
made ... bought towels and sheets ... in a trunk ... I still have the 
tr•tnk ... trusha 
was just thinking the other day it's 
stupid I don't use them

SIDE I 
Saint Joseph's Day Table: 
Did a Saint Joseph's Day Table for the first time in 1973. Had in 
her house, set up an altar. Priest came and gave mass. About 75 
people came, didn't have room for everyone. Priest suggested they 
have it in the church (Holy Rosary Church) the following year. 
Knew about the tradition from an Italian friend. Said they 
dedicated the table to the poor or the sick, and I thought it 
would be neat since there are so many sick in the parish. Got 
information from here and there until I got it together, and now 
it's a big success. 
Can't remember the name of the friend... she told Gen she needed a 
cross, heart, chalice with figs, no meat because it falls during 
Lent. vegetables... started from there and kept adding. Never been 
to a table ... has seen pictures in the paper... 
Feast Day of Saint Joseph celebrated in the Hispanic community? 
As far as I know, we're the only ones. Bread ordered from 
Vertamines (?)...12 loaves for the apostles. Have a prayer that 
goes along with it--a prayer given to her by someone. After mass, 
set up the altar in the parish center and after mass, priest 
blesses the bread; Gen breaks the bread in pieces and everyone 
IAW-PM-A017 - 
2 
partakes. Gave communion at her house in 1973. 
Now in the parish hall; mass said in the church. Set up one day 
before; on Saint Joseph's day have the viewing of the table from 
about 9-5. Then at 6 we have mass; go back to the hall; 
everything blessed. Father Walter Schmiegel (?) was the priest in 
1973... transferred, retired. Now have William Doll. 
Everyone took an interest after the first table ... break the 
bread, a round loaf and everyone eats from it... followed by a 
celebration... covered dish, people bring everything... no meat one 
the table ... mostly people don't bring meat... 
A woman from Salerno, Italy, came and visited our table ... people 
from the surrounding area. 
A committee of 3 men sets up the altar structure--cross, flowers; 
another with 5 women helps set up the table, tablecloths, food. 
Gold tablecloths, 4'-5' statue of Saint Joseph lent by a 
parishioner on the "altar" ("table" better). Look at photo from 
1974; small one; tissue paper flowers. Now have a wooden cross, 
men made one. On side of the statue, there are wheat plants...I 
plant it. 
Chalice, Heart and Cross frozen and used every year since the 
first year they had it. Bottles of red pop, whatever people 
donate. Other table is tiered versus a flat one. Three-tiers to 
hold everything people bring. 
Told have to have the fig chalice, cross and heart ... and all 
kinds of fruits, vegetables, pastries, cakes ... ask the 
parishioners if they want to donate... lamb cake, two hearts, 
Bible cake, chalice cake ... people donate them every year, the 
same women from the beginning... 
About 250 came, sat and ate. Constant traffic throughout the day. 
During the mass, took up a collection and donated it to the poor; 
up to Gen but sometimes asks the priest. Orphanage, soup kitchen. 
Covered dish... salads, chili verde, chili colorado, sopa (Spanish 
rice), calabacitas, refried beans, and American foods too. Make 
spaghetti themselves--Italian, American and Mexican--anything. 
Some women donate biscochito, a sugar cookie with anise, for the 
table. Empanitas, torte with pork filling. 
Starts making plans in January. Goes to the liturgy committee for 
readers, ushers. Plant wheat in February. People bring flowers. A 
lot of the same people donate. Bread ordered in February; 
parishioners pay for it. 
Dedication of the table. Told it had to be dedicated to someone 
IAW-PM-A017 - 
3 
who was sick, for a favor granted. The first year I had met some 
disabled people, thought how nice it would be do something for 
them. After that, at the church, dedicating it to different 
people. Choose the committee and priest, know sick people; ask 
them to be our guests. Has to be an odd number. 
Dedicate to different groups: senior citizens, teachers, sisters, 
sick, slow children. Number chosen. One year dedicated to the 
homeless. A big satisfaction for me. Word got around about a 
family with two children at the Salvation Army; had three other 
adults. People wondered why they were chosen. Asked them to be 
our guests, all came. Felt out of place. I told them you are one 
of us, children of God. Set up a special table for guests. 
Haven't got to giving them saints names; I have to study that. 
But I feel in my own mind, I'm doing a lot even if I'm missing 
part of the tradition. I get a big satisfaction by doing it, and 
so are the people who help. Will carry on for the rest of our 
lives. I told a man setting up the table, Richard Vigil, would 
you make me a promise--will you keep up this tradition for me. 
He said yes. 
Gen born November 24, 1922. A widow for 25 years; have one son. 
Family interested in the tradition. Really they come to eat and 
to mass, but they are there if I need them. Photo oldest 
grandson, James, working in the kitchen. 
Gives Manini a history "The Saint Joseph's Table," and a prayer 
for the blessing of the food. Everyone recites the prayer. Prayer 
card in Spanish: Oracion al Glorioso a San Jose. Bilingual mass. 
Images of Saint Joseph in the home? Yes. The Sacred Heart, 
Blessed Mother, Jesus, Saint Jude. After widowed, I decided to 
dedicate my life to God, he needs me. Son born in 1948. Husband a 
converted Protestant to Catholicism. Her folks born around Santa 
Fe, Ojo Caliente; four sisters and two brothers. Sister lives 
across the street; parents in back; they give donation for the 
poor. 
Brief discussion of terms: Hispanic, Mexican American, Spanish. 
SIDE II 
Ethnicity in Pueblo: 
Even their Spanish is different, just 200 miles away. We go to 
visit relatives... drag their words. Born in E1 Rito, New Mexico. 
Parents came to Colorado when she was 3, in Antonito in the San 
Luis Valley. Got married and worked at the Ordinance. Here 40-45 
years. 
IAW-PM-A017 - 
4 
Most in Pueblo came from New Mexico and the San Luis Valley for 
employment--mills, the Ordinance. Never had problems with 
discrimination in Pueblo; in Denver had one encounter. Best 
friends have been Anglos, Italians, Blacks. Skin not important, 
heart is. 
Parents never mentioned discrimination. Father adopted by an 
Anglo family. Son went to Catholic school with Anglos, Italians. 
Always taught my son never to consider himself lower than anyone 
else. 
Holy Rosary Parish is 100% Hispanic. Supposed to be a Hispanic 
church. Wonderful priests, priests draw the people. 
Saint Joseph's Day: 
Wants to learn more about the people who represents saints at the 
tables. Hasn't asked yet, but sure she would get help; they help 
each other. All about sharing. I'm thinking of talking to Sister 
Dominique, an Italian nun at another parish. Used to bring people 
from a nursing home to the table. 
First table, mass said in the living room. 
Covered dishes placed on a separate table; buffet. Cakes on table 
cut, come back for desert. Apples, nuts, whatever on the table. 
Vegetables on the Saint Joseph table given to the poor. Five 
women committee serve the special guests; get a bit everything. 
Served from the Saint Joseph table and the buffet table. 
Information concerning the table put in the church bulletin. 
Doesn't know if other Spanish people do a table. Not our 
tradition but I picked it up; Saint Joseph should be honored. I 
grabbed on to the idea because I heard so much about; must have 
come from God himself. I didn't know where to start. Started 
asking ... heard about an article in Good Housekeeping or Life 
Magazine but couldn't find it. I get little inspirations, this 
year will do this...I wanted to do something for somebody. I 
didn't know a lot, no history, just what came to do me.

SIDE 1 
Introduction. Saint Joseph's table at the Shrine of Saint 
Therese. 
Have done a table at the church for four years; suggested by Jim 
Pagano; asked Eve Taravella. Louise: he got idea when they were 
building a gazebo. None of the women are Sicilian. 
Williams remembers the tables from when she was a little girl in 
the Bessemer table. Taravella saw hers when she was 21, by the 
Buffalos on the Mesa. Zanini's husband was involved in them when 
he was a child; saw her first one about 10-15 years ago. 
IAW-PM-AO18 -

They contacted Sicilian people for information and to prepare 
food. Describes some of the food; names the people who donates 
the food. 
Taravella leaves with Ken Light to take some photographs. 
Photo album: 
Names some of the people in the photos in her album, from the 
first year they held the table; priest was Father McGuinness. 
Photos of the second year; changes in the table; different statue 
of Saint Joseph. 
Table set up in the Newman Room at the church. 
Any type of cookie because it really isn't the Sicilian table; 
one plate of everything goes on the table. 
Story of macaroni with breadcrumbs; priest said it looks like 
sawdust. Not familiar with the tradition where the breadcrumbs do 
represent sawdust. 
Wheat, fruit, wine, any kind of cookies even store-bought. 
Snifter to donate money. Money given to the priest; to be used 
for whoever needs it. Stuff on table brought to the sick; include 
a history of the table. Food all blessed. 
Williams compares it with the home tradition: in home, schedule 
of events, saints. Difficulty of choosing people to represent the 
saints in the context of the parish. Their schedule; covered 
dishes brought to the table. Meatballs made of bread crumbs. 
Meatless meal. Sauce. 
Someone made with a shamrock made two years; Saint Joseph's Day 
falls near Saint Patrick's Day and the priest is Irish. However 
they asked her not to make it the next year because it disturbed 
some people--why an Irish cake. But we don't have to do it in the 
traditional way. 
Zanini: It really brings a lot of cultures together... multi-
ethnic parish. 
Fish has to be there, two of them... Keep getting bigger. Size of 
the table; steps at the back of the table for tiers. Lace 
bedspread belonging to Williams, from hope chest, used on table. 
Embroidered sheets too. Lace tablecloth. (Eve Taravella 
returns.) 
Made table cloth from old curtains. 
Decision of the placement of objects and food on the table; Eve 
Taravella directs. Gets bigger each year. Variations in color? 
Easter lilies in 1989 because that year the feast day was so 
IAW-PM-AO18 - 
3 
close to Easter. Used silk lilies one year; daffodils another 
year. Icing on one cake made of melted jelly beans to look like 
stained glass; Stella Manatta (?) bought it for the table at 
Safeway. 
Baskets of bread dough; cross made by Frances Consialdi (?); lamb 
cakes, lamb represents Jesus. Photo of Dorothy Zanini and family. 
Sister Suzanne a nun who still wears habits; three nuns still 
wear the habits. Nuns don't help with the tables, but come to 
them. 
Gives Paula Manini a picture of the 1989 table (see archives). 
Decide on the best picture to give. 
Men that help set up. Value 
of scrapbooks. 
Taravella: We started having a guest book in 1989. 
People come after mass, and not all sign the book. 
Gives Manini a picture of the table from 1989. 
SIDE II 
This one is run different than the ones in the home so we can't 
show any partiality (by choosing saints). Input from several 
people but the three women make the final decisions. 
Donate of leftover food to soup kitchen or shut-ins. Story of 
Saint Joseph table requested by Manini. Also have something to 
color for the children. Story came from the Sicilians; read it 
for the moving pictures they take.

SIDE 1 
Story of the courtship and marriage of Louise and Angelo 
Williams: 
Once married had two bosses--her mother and husband. Mother 
insisted that Louise have her husband's permission for 
everything. His mother had remarried and he didn't want a step-
father so he lived by himself. 
Funerals in the old days: 
Louise met her mother-in-law in Roselawn Cemetery. Her mother and 
Mrs. Delia used to say the rosary for funerals at the mortuary. 
Louise use to ride in the limousines at these funerals. Rosary in

Italian. Wakes in homes. 
Louise's Wedding/Work/Killing Chickens: 
Married June 3, 1934. Got a hall in Bessemer. Made ham 
sandwiches, had beer. A hall above a bakery. She worked at 
Zoelmann's Bakery. 
Eve worked since she was 6, at their farm and a dairy; did 
everything. 
Dorothy chopped heads off chickens. Louise's mother wouldn't eat 
meat, except chicken. Pork if butchered if it didn't touch the 
beef. Used to upset her stomach. She promised she would never 
leave her mother. Sister would trick mother. 
How they killed chickens. Louise tells story of killing and 
cooking a turkey for one Thanksgiving. Husband takes a leg and 
thigh to her mother; mother wouldn't eat it. 
Dairy where Eve worked in Ouray: 
A dairy in Ouray; walked or rode a bike two miles to the dairy 
and did her own chores. An Italian family owned the dairy; 
furnished everyone in Ouray with milk. 
Christmas and Easter: 
Eve: Santa Claus would come; candy and orange. Not too many 
Italians where she lived. About five Italian families in Ouray, 
and less on the ranch. Lived around other ethnic groups. 
Christmas today--Italian sausage on Christmas Eve after midnight 
mass. No that was Easter. 
Louise: Christmas vigil. Fish, olives, Savoie cabbage, spaghetti 
with oil and garlic, baccala, smelts. Kids still do it. 
Eve: start baking in November; Italian recipes from her mom. 
Dorothy: kolaches and roleeks (?). Haven't made them in years. 
Mother-in-law was Ottorisi (?). Made Italian foods. 
Eve: for Easter her mother would make a doll out of pastry. 
Little horses for the girls. 
Louise: Easter baskets of dough too. 
Eve: doll with dress; boiled eggs for eyes. 
Louise: baked the basket with a raw egg; dye it in bread, not 
baskets. Made the little man with the egg in the belly ... you're 
mother probably used eggs for the bellies not eyes. Still makes 
IAW-PM-A019 -

the baskets of the bread. 
Put Easter breads on the (Saint Joseph's) tables. Others with the 
saints put 12 loaves for the saints, all the same shape. The 
bread on their table is all different. 
Saint Joseph's Day/Saint Therese's Shrine (Church): 
What if Easter and Saint Joseph's Day fell on the same day? 
Easter never comes that earlier... always have the table on March 
19, Saint Joseph's Day, no matter what day of the week. Some 
people want to have it on a weekend, or every other year. 
Number of people at the church. 
Devotion to Saint Joseph: 
Dorothy: my husband and son are named Joe... 
Louise: was Jesus' father... 
Dorothy: important, powerful saint... 
Eve: honor him on Saint Joseph's Day at the masses 
Zoelmann's Bakery/Church Festivals: 
Louise worked cleaning their house, wrapped the cookies, sack the 
pies. Big pans with 12 little pies. Bakers put them in the show 
cases; Louise would pull a pan, carry it on her head to the 
counter. The Zoelmann's were Germans in the middle of the Italian 
community—now the Martelli's run it ... use same recipes. 
Feast of the Assumption... another one at Eldorado (see Amella's 
tapes) ... good time ... Louise and her sister worked at the 
bakery ... in a hurry because wanted to go to a festival... pulled 
the pan in a hurry and pies flew off ... threw fell... she was a 
tight German woman... salvaged two pies ... ate the other one. 
Worked right after school ... she wouldn't even offer anything. 
Louise would count the donuts to see if there was any extra, so 
she could eat one. 
Festivals had processions... picture of her husband carrying a 
statue for the Assumption... highest bidder got to carry the 
statue ... the Assumption and Mount Carmel has it (festivals)... 
the Assumption in on Evans. Mount Carmel in the Grove did it 
first. The Assumption was a chapel from Mount Carmel, then made 
it into a church. The Assumption would have a procession on the 
Feast Day of the Assumption, the Sunday closest to August 15. 
People would follow the statue through the streets, saying the 
rosary, then brought it into the church. 
Dorothy: celebrations in Dewees, Nebraska for the Assumption. 
Louise: husband carried the statue in 50 or something... group of 
IAW-PM-A019 -

4 or 6 carried the statue. Now the Lodge does it. Still carries 
the statues at Mount Carmel (in July) and the Assumption Church 
(August). They've calmed it down but they used to shoot 
fireworks/### 
SIDE II 
Churches in Pueblo: 
Masses at the Cathedral. Twenty-two Catholic churches in Pueblo 
and some smaller communities in the area. 
Italian American Organizations: 
Several in town, but they don't belong to any. There's a Dante 
Alghieri Society. 
Italian language: 
Eve: speaks a little. 
Louise: speaks Italian. Mother only spoke Italian. Since her 
mother-in-law and mother gone, doesn't speak it any 
more ... dialect not book Italian. Son David speaks some; others 
understand some. Have lost it. 
Eve: mother-in-law dedicated to the festivals. Went around with 
the statue; sold tickets; belonged to Assumption Church but did 
it for the other churches too. 
Churches: 
Louise: Mount Carmel in the Grove ... would have to go over the 
tracks ... hard on the old people. So put in a bridge, but they 
were afraid of the bums who hung out there. So still used the 
bridge--dangerous. Then they got the Assumption, so she started 
going there; got killed by a car going there. The Assumption was 
originally a Lutheran church. Just had morning masses for the 
women. Started out as a chapel. Women in Bessemer would go to 
morning masses at Saint Patrick's so they wouldn't have to go 
over the bridge. Saint Patrick's was snooty. Saint Anthony's and 
Saint Mary's in the Grove too, on Clark Street. 
During Easter had the Sepulcher, when they put up the blessed 
sacrament on Holy Thursday. All the churches would have it; had 
to visit seven churches, or if you went to one church you were 
supposed to go in and out of it seven times. Don't push it 
anymore. Louise would look forward to that night going to Saint 
Mary's, Saint Anthony's, Mount Carmel ... seven times. She and her 
sister would sneak an extra one in... so wouldn't have to kneel in 
IAW-PM-A019 -

church that long. Father McGuinness still does it. Would say the 
rosary, a decade. One would lead, each had a turn to be the lead. 
Eve: has two sisters and a brother who are Jehovah's Witnesses. 
Louise: things have changed a lot... lived in Pueblo all my life, 
and in the Italian neighborhood. 
Lived with mother on Elm 
Street, and husband move in with them. Husband not only got a 
maid but a house and a mother. Had Louise and her mother waiting 
on him. Old fashioned Italian way ... wash their feet, polish their 
shoes. Then he'd get all dressed up and go out on Saturday 
night... gambler, went dancing. Then I went and played with the 
kids on the block, I was only a kid, 16, played with dolls. 
Stopped school when married. Everyone thought it was a shot gun 
wedding. No honeymoon but my mother went to Louise's sister's 
house that night, but she came home early that morning ... Lot of 
the others didn't do it that way though... mother strict. 
My mother would have a fellow come and bring cheese who wanted to 
marry her. Louise cried and said she didn't want her mother to 
get married because she didn't want a step-father. Louise said 
she would take care of her. Stayed in her house, 1014 Elm Street, 
until she died. Went to Danforth School, name later changed. A 
strict school, Mrs. Strack the principle. Mrs. Marion a 
teacher... started teaching right after she graduated. Lot only 
went through junior high. 
Eve: only she and her brother graduated from high school/###

Buffalo ) would walk barefoot to collect food or money for the 
table no matter what the weather . Father-in-law was Dominic 
Spicola (pronunciation changed), worked in the mills. 
People would wait every year to give her (Anna Buffalo) donations 
for the table. 
Anna Buffalo Spicola had first table because her sib Henry 
Spicola was very ill at three years old . She dressed him like 
Saint Joseph. 
He would wear the outfit to school , everywhere for 
one year . She had promised that. 
Table probably first held in 
1922; then had one every year after that until she died in 1938. 
Theresa 's mother donated to the table every year.

her 
Dad's family called it).

A friend, Ann Cicero, helps them 
"Italians 
will help out." 
PMM: 
Father Doll told me they have got phone calls from Italians 
who are mad that they (Hispanics) do Saint Joseph's Day tables. 
Mrs. Cicero and her neighbor Miss Belitti are Italian, and they 
help out. 
If they have the faith in Saint Joseph, what 
difference would it make? ... Don't we celebrate Saint Patrick's 
(Day). Didn't we have cabbage and corned beef? (laughs) 
They might feel that way because it originated with Italians. 
But what difference does it make? 
My neighbors are all Spanish, 
and they came to my tables. 
Is this a mixed ethnic neighborhood? 
Uh-huh .... Four families on 
this block of Italians; some, whatever they call themselves, 
white; the rest are ethnics.

Mother skeptic about Theresa marrying a Sicilian. 
PMM: Holy Rosary table? 
They don't arrange the fruit and things like we do. 
Cadnles, 
cookies, ro 
—etc, goes in certain places. 
I like to go and 
Just visualize it being ours .... Have as much food, people are 
gracious about food. 
PMM: 
Why do you think Mexican Americans would adopt a Sicilian 
tradition? 
They may have lived in an Italian neighborhood like Goat Hill, 
and seen a table ... Gina Spicola and Ralph Cisneros (?) do 
table...table should be ready by noon today. 
PMM: Why are-tables movinq from home to church? 
The 
and 
eo le won't ask for 
donations... too proud  
... but shouldn't have come up. 
Whet er you 
have a nickel or dime, if you say you are having a table you'll 
have money on the table. 
Daughter-in-law and son's table in Los 
Angeles in 1987; people gave Theresa money for that table. 
PMM: Tables in churches have a different function? 
They have a different meaning for everyone. 
I need to see 
one... still have linens her mother-in-law used on tables. 
PMM: Difference between tables at Saint Therese and Holy Rosary. 
More organized at Saint Therese. 
But by now Mrs. Archuletta must 
know what she is doing .... They have more faith than we do. 
Ours 
is dwindling. 
PMM: Relations between Italians and Mexicans? Some people say 
they always got along; others say no. 
We went to school with them; we had no prejudice; mother 
baptized, confirmed Mexican children. 
The generation coming 
up—hate to say it...I have children who are prejudiced. 
As 
they grew up, there were more Mexicans who came from Roswell and 
places. 
Husband was prejudiced... (story about him) ... Can't say 
that all of Pueblo are (prejudiced) 
PMM: 
Minority hiring? 
Caused all that friction...

William Doll is the priest at Holy Rosary Church. 
2400 West 22nd, Pueblo, Colorado, 81003. 
Tape one of two. 
Side one. 
Introduction. 
William born January 19, 1925, in northern Minnesota. 
Came to Colorado on June 20, 1950. 
Worked in several places in 
southern Colorado and on the western slope. 
Has learned some Spanish. 
One mass every Sunday in Spanish at 
Holy Rosary. 
In Silverton and Ouray, many people of Tyrolian Italian descent. 
In Lamar, two churches. 
One Hispanic church, with a different 
group of people who had come over the years from Mexico for sugar 
beet farming. 
Language different. 
At Holy Rosary, their roots in New Mexico, not Old Mexico. 
Moved 
into the San Luis Valley and then up for employment. 
Employment 
way down now. Steel mill and army depot are the major places 
where Hispanics worked. Army depot scheduled to close until the 
IAW-PM-A021 - 
2 
war broke out (Persian Gulf War). 
Less work so a number have 
left again. 
Small homes. 
Low income area. 
"West End" is predominantly 
Hispanic. 
Parish is 99% Hispanic, "I guess I'm that one percent. 
On Saint Patrick's Day it's kind of lonely here." 
A few spouses 
are not Hispanic. 
About 200 families in the parish, but don't know for sure. 
PMM: Your story about being teased because Hispanic parish doing 
the Saint Joseph's Day Table? 
Teased by bishops and other priests. 
Because it's an Italian 
tradition. 
"The Mafia is going to get you." 
But many of the 
people who teased him didn't know what it was. 
Explained to 
Bishop Buswell that a lot of food donated to the soup kitchen; 
part of the purpose of this. 
Even Bishop Tafoya, past bishop, asked about it. 
He too is very 
devoted to San Jose, has a special santo at his house. 
Which is 
typical of people from New Mexico and people in Colorado who came 
from New Mexico. 
People struck because it is Italian (the tradition) but Hispanics 
borrowed it. 
They don't realize we are probably running it 
bigger, and in a more solemn or special way. 
PMM: Devotion to San Jose, home altars? 
Saint Joseph is one of the major saint honored by the 
Hispanics. 
Christ, all the different images, Mary and maybe 
Saint Anthony. 
But Saint Joseph comes in a great deal, either 
alone or with the Holy Family.... teaching the child Jesus. 
The 
Hispanics have always had a great devotion to Saint Joseph. 
They 
can really identify with him. 
Known as the patron of the family, 
has known family difficulties, knows what it is to work hard, and 
that's been a lot of our people here, hard work. 
Sometimes no 
paid employment at all. 
The difficulties of providing a 
home ... patron of a Happy Death. 
These mean a lot to our people. 
He becomes a part of their family than in other places. A very 
familiar part. 
If praying for something (to Saint Joseph) and they don't get it, 
or he doesn't produce fast enough, they sometimes turn (the image 
of Saint Joseph) to the wall or take the child Jesus out of his 
arms. 
Sort of a punishment, sometimes put him in a trunk, then 
later retrieve him and put him in his place of honor. 
He is a 
very well known and loved saint of our Hispanics, in the whole 
southwest, and art will show that too. 
PMM: 
Do you find more devotion to him than Our Lady of Guadalupe 
or Jesus or Saint Anthony? 
IAW-PM-A021 - 
3 
They go together. 
Our Lady of Guadalupe is very great and then, 
of course, the Lord himself, on the cross or different 
presentations. 
Especially in the Passion. 
They can identify 
with Christ in the Passion.... (names the stages) .... (They 
identify with Christ) the most, and then Mary as Guadalupe 
especially, but Mary has many titles .... Mass at the Cathedral for 
Guadalupe Day, the mariachis. 
Even on their annual festival in August, (you see) Our Lady of 
Guadalupe in the dress, on the back of jackets... common and even 
expected. 
Annual parish festival, no particular feast day .... O 
Other saints have dropped away from our consciousness here. 
Ones 
made by the santeros ... San Acacio, Saint George, Saint Rafael, 
even 'great ones' like Saint Michael and Saint James (brought 
over from Spain) don't have any predominance anymore. 
They lived 
in isolation for centuries... forgotten. 
But they remember the major ones, Christ, Mary, Joseph, Anthony. 
Anthony sponsored by the Franciscans in New Mexico for centuries. 
These are saints they can understand and identify with, and go 
to, feel close to. 
PMM: Pray to Saint Joseph for special things? 
I can't answer that properly. 
But Saint Joseph on the home 
altars. 
Family, I think, Happy Death, ordinary home situations. 
With children, work, sickness. 
Because Saint Joseph knew what it 
was like to raise a family, support them and be persecuted... they 
understand these things. 
Difficulties in New Mexico and southern 
Colorado make them identify with him--the drought, poor 
agricultural conditions, attacks of Indians centuries ago, 
disease, isolation, no doctors or hospitals. 
Very close to 
Joseph, I would say. 
Most parishioners have home altars. 
Most in bedroom or living 
room, or little niches. 
Old statues. 
New religion coming in... 
one dear old lady, her daughter made her gather up all the 
santos, art work, rosaries, crucifixes. 
I felt real bad, some of 
these things have probably been in the family for generations, 
centuries. 
A great loss there, they were part of the family. 
PMM: Who makes the home altars? 
Women speak most often of them but the men have deep feelings 
about them too. 
PMM: Can you describe a fairly typical altar? 
Often sanctuary lights on the altar. 
Makes me afraid about 
fires.... crucifix of course. 
Their own art is fine but sometimes 
have these real cheap things ... they can do better. 
Statue of 
Sacred Heart, Mary, Joseph, often together. 
Saint Anthony. 
IAW-PM-A021 - 
4 
Sometimes Saint Martin de Porras (?) too. 
PMM: Other things on altar? Family photos? 
Sure, especially of those in the military. 
Blessed palms, 
rosaries, they like the real giant rosaries. 
Sometimes flags, 
scarves. Quite a bright piece of work sometimes, bright colors. 
Generally a candle burning, worried about fires. 
PMM: 
Obvious Mexican Americans have a great devotion to Saint 
Joseph, and I understand why they want to honor him on his feast 
day. 
But why with a Sicilian tradition? 
First of all, they have had the honor and love and devotion of 
Saint Joseph. 
Doing the table is something that must appeal 
greatly to them, as to the Italian. 
This is something they can 
see and touch and eat, and they themselves contribute, their own 
making and so on, it's part of themselves in that. 
The bright 
colors on the altar, the statue of Saint Joseph, it apparently 
takes on a meaning that many of us don't understand or 
appreciate. But it has certainly been well accepted. 
PMM: 
Transition easier because of home altar tradition? 
Well, yes (hesitantly). 
They like to gather for any occasion or 
festival of any kind, if it's on the name of a saint all the 
better. 
They are great at celebrating and we have a lot to learn 
from that. 
They are a people who have a lot of hardship and 
difficulty and sadness in their life, and they need to celebrate 
whenever possible. 
What better occasion than the feast of a 
saint. 
The Saint Joseph table seems to adapt, fit well with 
whatever their needs are. 
Some of the greater things sometimes, of the spiritual, 
sacramental, supernatural they miss sometimes, but they latch on 
to this. 
We take them wherever they are, whatever they can use. 
Fits into their idea of what they can do and see and touch and 
identify with, and have a big meal together. 
PMM: Do the other people (not the organizers) realize ... this is a 
Sicilian tradition? 
I don't know if they do or not. 
The priests certainly do. 
Just 
talking to a Sicilian priest, Father John Costanza, who has never 
seen the custom. 
Not a well known tradition, but well received 
here, and just brought right in to our Hispanic background.... 
PMM: 
Phone calls from irate Italians? 
Gen Archuletta got them. 
What are those Mexicans doing over 
there with the Saint Joseph Day table. Well, Saint Joseph knows 
Spanish too, not just Italian. 
He is patron of the Universal 
Church, and we love him too, always have .... Every year we have 
IAW-PM-A021 - 
5 
it, not just for a particular need. 
Regular Italian parishes 
don't have it; they have it in the homes, and not necessarily on 
Saint Joseph's Day—don't know why. 
Saint Joseph's Church, 
Father Len Backey (?) and Father Norm Bouchard. 
More of a small, family celebration. 
Here a parish celebration. 
Gives us another chance to celebrate. Lends significance and 
solemnity to the mass, brings people from all over town over here 
for the first time—it's a hard place to find. 
It's been a quiet 
little secluded area and even some of the clergy don't know how 
to find it ... Make their way over to pay honor Joseph, make 
donations, pastry, food. To pay homage to Joseph. 
PMM: Part of the tradition seems to be sharing with others. 
That's part of it. 
In the new book that I showed you, Church 
Blessings, it is described that way, food for the poor. 
PMM: Do you think it is a financial hardship on any of the 
parishioners to contribute? 
I don't think so ... they want to do it ... are proud to do it ... not 
pressured. 
They can see what they are giving and what's 
happening to it; they like to give better that way. 
PMM: 
People have mentioned they are a poorer parish, or say they 
don't have the money for something... 
Yes, but that's good in a way... somewhat of a sacrificial nature. 
We don't bring out the finest china and silver .... that would fit 
more the background of Saint Joseph at Nazareth.... scrimp and 
save, live simply.... better imitation of the home in 
Nazareth ... we would rather have the people their goodwill and 
enjoyment. 
PMM: Other Hispanic traditions? 
Penitentes? 
Active Penitentes in the parish, but active in Taos, New Mexico. 
Activities during Lent and Easter .... An morada in Avondale, but 
not active because they are old people. 
Speaks about the history of Penitentes, their importance in 
filling the needs of the people when clergy is not available, lay 
leadership, relationship with church. The Penitente rosary. 
The 
mound near the drive maybe a throw back to Cavalry, where the 
Penitentes carry the cross on Good Friday. 
We have a bon fire 
out there for the Easter vigil. 
END OF SIDE I 
SIDE II 
IAW-PM-AO21 -

Continues with activities of the Penitentes and the good they 
have brought to the area. 
Also talks about their silence and 
persecution. 
His first encounter with a Penitente funeral. 
Church's mission is to bless and guide them. 
They often went too 
far ... nailing to the cross, etc. 
We lost so many Catholics 
because we didn't understand them. 
Settlers who came on the 
Santa Fe Trail, and Bishop Lamie from France, were shocked at 
what they saw... ignorance on the part of the church, harm was 
done. 
Ignorance of Protestant people coming from the eastern 
states. 
So Penitentes went underground. 
They still don't talk 
about their activities. 
Now we work with the Penitentes, to bless their efforts and guide 
them. 
We need them. 
Penitential practices from Spain. 
Protestant writers wrote about them as a spectacle, no respect 
for them. 
PMM: 
Ku Klux Klan in the area? 
Catholics targeted? 
Catholics classed as a minority with Jews and Blacks. 
Ku Klux 
Klan made it difficult for Catholics to get altar wine. 
But 
Italian priests made own wine. 
Some persecution in Pueblo; 
account of some who dragged a priest out of a church during 
mass. 
PMM: 
At the time of the arrival of European immigrants to 
Pueblo, was there a lot of interaction between Hispanics and the 
immigrants? 
Men worked together. 
But worshipped in own national churches. 
Italians went to Mount Carmel. Germans went to Saint Boniface. 
Slovenians was Saint Mary. 
And Slovaks had Saint Anthony. 
All 
in the Grove, within a few blocks of each other. 
Mexicans had Sacred Heart in Salt Creek, no longer there, and 
maybe Holy Family. 
Later were absorbed in Mount Carmel; now the 
national church for Spanish-speaking people. 
No more Saint 
Anthony; Slovaks just about died out as Slovaks. 
Saint Mary was 
damaged in 1921 flood so rebuilt closer to the steel mill. 
Hispanics had smaller ones in Salt Creek. 
Sometime back Mount 
Carmel took over for the Hispanics. 
These were national churches 
with no borders, like Saint Anthony's. 
Some had both, 
nationalities and borders, like Saint Mary's. 
Even today, like 
Mount Carmel, Hispanics or Italians from the whole area can claim 
that as their parish. 
Stayed together for protection and mutual 
strength, lodges, insurance. 
PMM: Is Hyde Park the only Hispanic neighborhood? 
IAW-PM-A021 - 
7 
Dogpatch on the East Side, they have Saint Ann's Church. 
They 
too have a church brought in from the airbase chapel. 
We had to 
move our church across town; cut up in seven pieces. 
The air 
base, now the airport. 
After the war, vacant buildings available 
for little or nothing. 
Salt Creek another Hispanic area. 
Still deprived in many ways. 
Not in city limits, no police protection, no bus service. 
All 
this was here earlier. 
A pastor, Father Sierra, had to fight to 
get fire protection, police and proper roads; water, and the 
sewer. 
Salt Creek still like that. 
Greatest concentrations of Hispanics: Hyde Park, Salt Creek and 
Dogpatch. 
PMM: Other ethnic areas? 
Not so much anymore ... Goat Hill was mainly Italian, but not 
anymore. 
A very small Black population. 
A new Black priest 
researching them. 
Blacks in the southside, around Saint Anthony 
and the Assumption parish. 
Not many Black Catholics. 
Black 
priest in the San Luis Valley. 
He can identify very well with 
the Hispanics... both gone through discrimination, prejudice. 
Black priest's name ... can't remember. 
PMM: Tells him that African Americans in New Orleans have adopted 
the Saint Joseph's Day table tradition. Talks about cross-ethnic 
movement of the tradition. 
Black priest is Father Gene Hardin. 
Now gathering information on 
the Ku Klux Klan in Colorado ... a strong, political movement in 
Denver in the 1920's. 
In Colorado, I worked with people I had never heard of, Italians 
and Hispanics. 
I grew up with Swedes, Norwegians, Germans, 
Irish, Finns in northern Minnesota. 
Doll is German and Irish. 
PMM: 
How do priests receive assignments? 
Father Doll explains the system, and how he came to Colorado with 
another priest Father Gallagher. 
Few native Hispanic clergy, or 
from the Diocese in general... (PMM: Why?) .... Celibacy, importance 
of having family ... not welcomed by the church... some didn't have 
the money to go to school. 
My whole background is German... school established to provide 
German clergy for the immigrants. 
Only offered fundamental 
Spanish. 
Learned about German culture...Had to pick up things 
himself when he came...I was embarrassed... couldn't even 
pronounce their names; saw different customs. 
Now a Hispanic bishop and a ministry, and seminarians but haven't 
had an ordination in years. 
Makes it real difficult. 
Would like 
IAW-PM-A021 - 
8 
to have at least one Hispanic pastor in each parish. 
Legacy of 
discrimination in the seminaries; this continues in some places. 
Talk about creating Hispanic seminaries so the change isn't so 
drastic for Hispanic seminarians.

Note: Although this tape catalogue is quite lengthy, it is not a

Listen to the tape for any direct quotes. 
William Doll is the priest at Holy Rosary Church. 
2400 West 22nd, Pueblo, Colorado, 81003. 
Tape two of two. 
Side one. 
Side two not used. 
PMM: 
Putting the Saint Joseph's Day table tradition in the 
context of local history. 
New church publication, "Book of Blessings," includes a blessing 
for the Saint Joseph's Day table. 
Before, just used any 
blessing, or blessing of food; there wasn't an official blessing 
before this. 
PMM: 
Local variations of the tradition in Pueblo and in general. 
Movement across ethnic boundaries. 
Still a matter of surprise and wonderment... clergy asked what am 
I doing with a Saint Joseph's table over here. 
PMM: Are there any other adopted traditions? 
San Isidro? 
Not here, no agriculture. 
But cows, goats, etc. Saint Isidro the 
patron of farmers. 
IAW-PM-A022 - 
2 
PMM: 
Bless animals? 
Former pastor blessed pigeons. 
Another pastor would bless 
animals from the nature center, and have children bring pets 
too. 
PMM: 
August Festival and Fall Festival? 
Same one, but now it's in June. 
State Fair interfered. 
And then 
school starts; parish doesn't have much money and they need to 
buy clothes for the children. 
So it's in June this year. 
Have 
to take turns all over the city. 
Don't really observe the Feast Day of the Holy Rosary. 
Every 
year we have a festival, a get-together and to raise money. 
Saint Joseph's Day table not a fund-raiser. 
PMM: 
I enjoyed the mass ... and how you fit together what Saint 
Joseph means and how to fit that into their daily lives .... The 
value of hard work--whether in the mills or washing dishes, 
vacuuming, taking care of children. For the women? 
The carpenter's square as his symbol... Didn't want to make the 
women feel left out. 
As in most things, the women are the 
workers and the promoters, but men enjoy it. 
Turn recorder off and on again. 
PMM: 
Early Italian priests in Colorado? 
Yes, over a century ago, many of the early priests.... like the 
one who started what is now the Cathedral, it was Saint Ignacius. 
Saint Patrick's and Mount Carmel. 
And also in Trinidad and 
Walsenburg. A lot (of the priests) were Italian. 
Of course, they 
fit in well with the Spanish because they could easily learn the 
language, switching from Italian... maybe not the best Spanish. 
Priests came from the Neapolitan province in Italy, where there 
was some kind of persecution... so they become available, so both 
Colorado and New Mexico (of course, they were the same then), 
Bishop Lamie and Bishop Machbuff (spelling) got a number of those 
priests. 
They were the pioneers, they were Jesuits, they came 
and laid the groundwork for much of our diocese. 
The present Cathedral, the third church already, was Saint 
Ignacious ... renamed Sacred Heart (Cathedral). 
The other places 
around the diocese ... work done by Jesuits who traveled a lot... 
by horse, train ... to centers with two or three priests... traveled 
over half the state, from Salida to Kansas. 
Tried to keep one 
here and one on the road. 
From the province of Naples. 
Often had Italian or Italian American priests here. 
Mount Carmel 
IAW-PM-A022 - 
3 
a Jesuit parish, Saint Joseph. 
Don't have many Jesuits because 
they followed the true mission spirit. 
As the parish grew and 
became self-sufficient, they would travel on to start another 
one. 
Names other churches in Pueblo which are Jesuit parishes. 
From 1977-87, worked in Ouray and Silverton. 
Italians from Tyrol 
there. 
Some Hispanic, but knew English, so lost a lot of 
Spanish. 
Different customs, words, food, mushrooms. 
Italian families from that area: can't remember names. 
PMM: Monolingual Spanish-speakers in this parish (Holy Rosary)? 
Yes, especially some of the women. 
One in the altar society, 
person sitting next to her translating the conversation. 
Men learned English because they went outside of the home to 
work. 
Women didn't have to. 
(Most now are bilingual?) 
A lot of 
children now, don't know Spanish. 
Difficult to find readers who 
know Spanish. 
PMM: I observed code-switching.. 
Yes, our Bishop is the same way. 
PMM: 
Anyone in the parish from Old Mexico? 
No, not that I know of. 
In Pueblo, by the Cathedral, in-between 
the railroad tracks, Carmen Road, a lot of people from Old 
Mexico. 
In Salt Creek too. 
PMM: 
Tension between people from Old Mexico and Hispanics? 
Can't answer. 
No migrant workers in the parish. 
Tension with 
landlords who cheat the workers.... People in parish maintain ties 
with families in the San Luis Valley and in New Mexico. 
Some 
maintain two homes, one here one there. 
PMM: 
New Mexico and Old Mexico distinction? 
Don't like to be identified with Old Mexico. 
Problem of 
semantics about 20 years ago with the Chicano movement. 
Hispanic 
the preferred time; don't like the term Chicano. 
No ties with 
Old Mexico, but travel to New Mexico a lot, at the drop of a 
hat. 
Bus trips, the choir, regular pilgrimages, Bishop from New 
Mexico. 
Just use the term Hispanic. 
Don't use word Mexican-American, no 
hyphen. 
They have been here so long, they are Americans, no 
question about that. 
IAW-PM-A022 - 
4 
Movement a few years ago to get rid of Spanish as an official 
language, caused a lot of hard feelings. 
Removed from Old Mexico so long. 
They even realize they talk 
different than people from Old Mexico. 
PMM: 
Do they use the term Italian American or Italian? 
Mostly just "Italians." Often have to be careful, term "Mexican" 
can be a put down. 
Hispanic or Spanish-speaking the preferred 
terms ... but depends on the tone, and your attention. 
Gen Archuletta's background is in the San Luis Valley, one step 
up from New Mexico. 
Needed protection from Indian attacks.

In the summer of 1990, Paula Manini interviewed Eve Taravella, 
Louise Williams and Dorothy Zanini about their activities with 
the Saint Joseph's Day table at the Shrine of Saint Therese. 
When I saw them at the event on March 19, 1991, I also met Eve's 
husband John Taravella. 
He expressed some disappointment that he 
was never interviewed for the IAW project, which received local 
press. 
So I offered to do an interview with him this afternoon. 
Eve Taravella and Louise Williams are present and do contribute 
to the interview although it is very hard to hear them. 
Earlier 
in the day, they had all worked to dismantle the Saint Joseph's 
Day table at the parish center at the Shrine of Saint Therese, 
and to make up boxes of pastries for delivery to "the shut-ins" 
who belong to the parish. 
In the living room of Eve and John Taravella home. 
John Taravella was born on the family farm on Saint Charles Mesa 
(east of Pueblo) on February 29, 1924. 
A leap year baby. 
Immigrant history of parents. 
From Alia, Sicily. 
Got married in Alia, when they were 18, and 
20 years old. 
Saved money to come over. 
Three months on the ship coming over. 
Mother was pregnant. 
IAW-PM-A023 -

Came before 1900. 
About, 89 years ago. 
Thought they were going to find a pot of gold. 
Came to New 
Orleans, worked in the cane fields. 
It was sad because they never saw their families again. 
Father cut cane for 50 cents a day, sun up to sun down. 
That's 
how they got the name Dago. 
When sun was going down, they would 
say, "Pretty soon 'day go,"' 
Mother worked for 25 cents a day. 
Paid a baby sitter 10 cents a 
day .... And they saved money. 
Two brothers and a sister born there. 
Charles, Louis and Jessie 
born in Louisiana. 
Father had a sister in Pueblo. 
Mother knew how to write. 
Father's sister told him to come to Pueblo; said a lot of work 
here. 
Sister's husband had a little farm; sister's husband is 
Anthony Spinuzzi. 
Didn't know any English when they arrived. 
Mother paid an 
interpreter to buy groceries for her. 
The woman interpreter had 
an apron with a lot of pockets; put a bit of sugar, flour, etc. 
in each pocket. 
Went to the store and said, "I want this, and 
this, and this." 
Mother made herself an apron so she wouldn't 
need an interpreter. 
Older sister-in-law still living and knows a lot of stories. 
Older brothers, Charles and Louis, were ornery. 
Would sell 
papers, and gave what they made to parents. 
Then started keeping 
it, and started stealing. 
Got whippings. 
Were afraid to come 
home. So would hide in the Dutch oven. 
Parents would worry. 
Parents made them return stolen goods. 
Dad had an accident at the mill. 
Got his face broken. Couldn't 
work. 
Brothers would run off to Cardinelli's (Cardinale?), where 
there was a dairy. 
Talked their father into buying a farm. 
Brothers only stayed two years; farming too hard. Dad bought 40 
acres, didn't know about farming. 
Brothers left home. 
Father hit with a big pot of steel in the face. 
Worked in the 
Open Hearth at the mill. 
That's when the mother made a Saint 
Joseph's Day table—promised that she would make a table if he 
got well. 
Parents came to the United States in 1905 or so. 
John is the 
12th child of 13. 
Saint Joseph's Day table made before he was 
born. 
Some born in town, some in the country. 
IAW-PM-A023 -

Remembers Saint Joseph's Day tables. 
Orphaned children chosen to 
represent saints at the tables. 
John wanted to be a saint, saw 
the orphans eating all the food. 
John's earliest memories of a table was when he was 7 or 8. 
Mother made another table because his brother Sam Taravella was 
sick. 
One table for his father. 
No doctors, so prayed to Saint Joseph. 
That's how it started in 
Sicily. 
(Talking to Louise; difficult to hear her). 
Sicily 
owned by Portugal, Spain, then Italy. 
No law there, so how the 
Mafia got started. 
The law was really rich. 
Traced family tree all the way to Spain. 
So when Italy took it 
over; if you were bad, you were sent to Sicily. 
Dad bought that "stupid farm" for my brothers, who left. 
Dad 
always talked about how beautiful Sicily was, trees, fruit. 
Brother in California got sick; went back to California. 
Brother 
told him how beautiful California was, like Sicily. 
But Dad 
wouldn't believe him because he lied so much. 
People would donate to make the Saint Joseph's Day table. 
Asked 
people. 
First table on the Saint Charles Mesa. 
Dad had a pimple on his tongue. 
Cancerous, so operated. 
Mother 
again made a promise to Saint Joseph that if he cured the tongue, 
she would have a table. 
Farm on 28th Lane on the Saint Charles Mesa. 
Tough going. 
Really hell on earth. 
He thought Italy was hell, but it was 
worse here. 
Good until the Depression, then couldn't sell the 
vegetables; just traded items. 
Did own canning: pickles, jelly, tomato paste. 
Only bought flour 
and sugar. 
Neighbors on the Mesa: Panaleo's (spelling) and Cordo's, 
Martellaro's. 
All Italians. 
All farm work done by hand. 
In Alia, father worked as a vegetable and fruit farmer in Alia. 
Father Joseph Taravella. 
Mother Concetta Ricotta. Little 
schooling. 
Corresponded with his mother's mother. 
Mother would cry for her 
mother, and family, when she got letters from home. 
Alia is near Lucca Sicula. 
Like from here to Blende. 
In 1939, paid the farm off. 
We owed Joe Gagliano from buying 
groceries on credit. 
President Roosevelt cancelled all old 
IAW-PM-AO23 -

debts. 
But his father paid Gagliano half of what he owed him 
anyway. 
Franklin Roosevelt closed all the banks and then started 
insured banks. 
Measures to get us out of the Depression. 
Joe Gagliano's grocery store, Elm Street. 
Just up from Gus' 
Place. 
The Bessemer Mercantile, where Joe and Rose Cortese are. 
END SIDE I 
SIDE II: 
Made own ice cream maybe for Fourth of July. 
Never got candy. 
Baked for Christmas and Easter. 
Two brothers went to war, John left on farm. 
Peddled from a horse and wagon, house to house. 
1938-39, things 
started picking up. 
Went to Bojon town, on the other side of 
Bessemer. 
All Austrian people. 
Bessemer was all Italian. The Heights was Austrian. 
Bojons: 
Austrian, Czechs...They had a little more money than the 
Italians, who were discriminated against. 
Called us Mafia; some 
were but most hard-working. Bojons had better jobs in the mills. 
Most Italians were farmers. 
Farm still owned by the family, but 
rent out most of it to a man who raises feed for his cattle. 
Each sibling has four acres. 
Saint Joseph's day table tradition stopped with his mother. 
Intermarriage between Italians from various areas in Italy. 
Sicilians started own lodge because couldn't get in the others. 
Even if you were Sicilian, there were differences between people 
from different towns. 
Between people from Alia and Lucca, for 
instance. 
Started changing around 1938, 1939 maybe. 
Before the 
war, 1936 or 37. 
Flood moved Italians from the Grove to Goat Hill. 
John's family made cheese, sausage, wine. 
Lot of cherry trees, 
so made cherry wine. 
Worked when you were 5 or 6 old. 
Dad made 
them hoe the ditch banks. 
Father would work at the mill; would 
tell you at night what you had to do the next day. 
Worked 12 hours a day at a dollar a day at the mills. Not much 
better here than in Italy. 
Father never went back to Italy. 
Didn't want to go. 
John would 
like to go back. 
Parents lived in town in Italy, and would walk 
to the fields. 
IAW-PM-A023 -

Left the fields at night, and friends would scare them. 
Put two 
lit sticks in their mouths, and wore a sheet. Someone through a 
rock, and killed the prankster. 
John and family had a radio but it would only stay on for 10 or 
15 minutes, then it had to rest for 10 or 15 minutes. 
Eve's parents lived on a mountain. 
They were from Ouray, and 
made their own electricity with carbine. 
John's first language was Italian. 
Eve's father would tell 
stories in Italian, but John couldn't understand them. 
Differences in the languages. 
John's folks speak it like it was 
written. 
Cousin Louis Ricotta was head of the Democratic party 
in Italy, could hardly understand his English. 
He visits neighbors who are from Alia, tells them to speak 
Italian. 
Some people in Pueblo who were born in Italy. 
Neighbors have 
been here for 30-35 years. 
They have better homes. 
Several came 
right after the war; assisted by relatives already there. 
John went to school at Fairview, on the Mesa. 
Two rooms. 
Went 
to school and worked on the farm picking vegetables. 
Walked 3-4 
miles to school. 
Used to get lots of snow. 
Big kids would make 
a path in the snow for the following little kids. Parents wanted 
kids to go to school. 
Most only went to 5 or 6 grade though. 
Louise Williams: 
If you went to high school, started to teach 
right away. Like Mrs. Marion. 
Had to learn English when you went to school. 
Kids in school: 
Italians (Wops) and 'Mericans.' 
When we got older, we figured 
the only Mericans were the Indians. 
Had to learn English and 
keep up with the Mericans. 
Hard time. 
Then would go home and work until eight, milk the cows and 
unharness the horses. 
Then told to do homework. 
No fun times. 
Only an hour off for lunch; would walk two miles to swim in the 
Bessemer ditch, and then walk back. Time off to play in the 
winter. 
Two older brothers went into the army; John, little sister, and 
parents left on the farm. 
Hailed out, didn't make a dime. 
He 
was deferred from the service because he was a farmer. 
Hailed 
three times; quit farming to go into the mills in 1945. 
War 
stopped. 
Went to Saint Louis, California, then returned to the 
mills.

discrimination ... Before a lot of Austrians and Mericans. 
(Son enters with a puppy.) 
Wasn't easy growing up in our day. 
Mother died first at age 87, then Dad six months later at age 
91. 
Dad had to ride a horse about six miles from the Saint Charles 
Mesa to the mills. Wrapped self up in sacks. 
No schedule at the 
mill. 
Would keep the Mericans and send the Italians back. 
Got 
pneumonia three or four times. 
Italians treated badly. 
Bosses 
were Mericans (English, Irish, Germans); favored their relatives. 
Mexicans had the worse jobs, and Italians.
