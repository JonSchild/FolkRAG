Dear Professor Hawes:
 
So far no one has offered aaythiriv about the
 
Mexican-Americans for the April meeting of the
 
California Folklore Society.
 You, I gather from ,
your
 
title, are offering a paper of double interest: literary
 
and sociological.
 Therefore, I accept it with pleasure
 
and ,
a
ith great interest anticipate hearing it.
 
Each participant is being asked to limit his or
 
her paper to twenty-five minutes and to send me a
 
;
synopsis as soon as possible.
 I expect that in time
 
w
,
 , shall_ have a crowded program, and I want it to
 
run as smoothly as possible.
 
T a
re looking forward to meeting you in Davis.

Dear Bess:
 
February 16, 1974
 
As I requested a long time back, you sent me your file of material
 
regarding the California Folklore Society,  for which I thank you.
 But
 
as I look through it, I find that the only copy of the Constitution is
 
one as revised in 1967.
 I am sure there have been changes since then,
 
but I can't find any record of them.  1
4y immediate problem is: `
ghat new
 
officers must we elect at our April meeting this year?
 
Is the President up for election every year or does he/she have a
 
two-year term?  Are the two student vice presidents elected each year,
 
or do they have staggered two-year terms?  And I suppose under normal
 
procedure Eleanor Long's term as a regional vice president expires this
 
year and we are to elect a replacement from the North end?
 
All this is leading up to a request.  Will you serve as head of the
 
nominating committee?  Assuming that yuu say yea, who else would you like
 
to have on the committee to help pick the new officers?  Since we decided
 
last year to keep it the California and not the Western Folklore Societ,
,,,
 
I suppose our regional vice presidents should still come from California.
 
Possible people might be Roland Dickison, Sacramento State U; Dan Crowley,
 
UC Davis; W. H. Hutchinson, Cal State Chico; Her:
:inia Menez, Cal State
 
Sonoma; and of course the possible re-election of Eleanor Long, Santa Clera.
 
Lew Girdler is still around, though retired; he lives in Berkeley.  There
 
must be others, but I don't think of them right now. And there is the UC
 
Berkeley group, Dundes, et al.
 
Please let me knovi of your acceptance right away, and I
'll get out
 
another presidential newsletter announcing it.
 Al-�o I
'll want to announce
 
that we have sent out our preliminary request for a grant to support the
 
internship program.  Our local grantsmanship people are very enthusiastic
 
about it; they think we have a very good chance to get the $30,000 we are
 
asking for.
 
Yours,

Dear Hector:
 
Herewith, at long last, a selection from what turns out to be my
 
remarkably numerous collection of California Folklore Society
 
constitutions.  For such an essentially straight-forward and
 
uncomplicated document, it has certainly appeared in nubetoud
 
versions.  I think what I am sending along is the latest; I
 
suppose only
 7
o—a
n Perkal knows for sure, and I will ask her to
 
send you a confirming copy when I next see her.  I have no copies
 
of last year's resolutions, but they were included, as I recall,
 
in the last issue of the Crock (in the Secretary's report).
 
I
'll get on to Joanie and 
`g
her to send you a zeros of her
 
report just to be sure.
 
I am getting; very excited about the Smithsonian's plans for the
 
Bicentennial.  It seems to me that this should be fittable in
 
with our internia&pprogram in some way or another.  Dick Byington
 
is, I understand, going to be at UCLtk some time i
n the neat ter
_
 
days or so, and I will try to get a copy of your proposal to him
 
for his information, and also chat with him a bit about it. Really,
 
I think he should journey up to aonoma to see you and 1 shall tell
 
him so -- or perhaps you can come down here?  That will be a plea-
sure for us all.
 
I keep feeling; as though my sabbatical hasn't yet begun, though
 
it's actually two months gone; there are so many clean-up chores
 
to be done hereabouts, but I am making; gradual headway.  Next
 
week my part on the film of the Los Angeles fiddler I
've been
 
working on will be done, and I intend to start hitting the library
 
for a few days a week and trying to get a bit of writing done.
 
The great problem and pleasure of academia is that you can't tell
 
your work .
from your hobby, can you?
 
Affectionately,

Dear Bess:
 
August 22, 1

Thanks for your pleasant letter noting the occasion of my
 
Ascension.  As the president of CFS I won't be any great shakes,
 
but I
'll try to move the Society maybe one more step in the direction
 
y
,ou have so ably charted for us during your term of office.  I haven't
 
yet had time to think much about what is to be done, but I am getting
 
a notion that one thing I want to do is communicate closely with the
 
officers, and I want to clue you in on everything.  So you'll be
 
getting copies of whatever goes into the mail.  Wayland, also, and
 
perhaps  one or two other important people.
 
Joanie Perkal sent me her excellent minutes and some good material
 
about hustling foundation grants.  I guess raising money will be one of
 
our serious jobs this year.
 
You refer to your CFS files.  I think I
'd like to have (
1) a copy
 
or two of our latest version of our Constitution, and (
2) any motions
 
or resolutions passed by the Society.
 I
'm sure Joan has all this in
 
her file of Minutes, but she should keep them intact.
 I
'll need to know
 
what our "operational" policies are, but beyond that I
'll leave to you
 
as to what you might want to send.
 
I hope that this new assignment of mine will mean that I
'll get to
 
see you a little oftener.  It is always a pleasure.
 
Ever,
 
Hector Lee

Dear Bess,
 
Feb. 2
3, 1
973
 
Your letter of the 17th arrived today, and I hasten to answer it
 
in order to keep things moving.  First: I did not receive and have not
 
seen the fir
s t issue of the Crock. 
I heard that it was out, though, but
 
not until a couple of weeks ago when I sent Barbara a kind of "editorial"
 
that had been long overdue for the first issue.  She probably will not
 
want to use it now, particularly if she prints the "Proposal" in its
 
present f
orm.
 I h
-id planned to cut it down to a shorter length to send
 
to the junior colleges to see how interested they might be in such a
 
scheme.
 
The first draft of the "Proposal" was sent only to you officers
 
of the Society: Yourself, Bob Georges, Eleanor Long, Marjorie McLain,
 
and Barbara Hahm; also Joan Perkal, Scott Hambly, Wayland Hand, and a
 
few others from whom I wanted personal reactions.  These were Byrd
 
Granger, Alan Dundes, Oig Eisner, Dick Dorson, and Barre Toelken.  I
 
don't know why I didn't think to send one to Sam Minton, but I
'll put
 
one in the mail to him today.
 (No...on re-reading your latter I note
 
that ,
you have sent him a xerox copy, so I won't.)  Enclosed are five
 
copies of it f
or ,
you to use as you see fit. I can run off more if you want.
 
I am glad you are calling a Board meeting for the night of May 17th.
 
Sure, I
'll be glad to attend.
 
Yours,
 
Hector H
. Lee

you send me a copy of the Crock?

APPLIED FOLKLOPW
 
A Proposal 
by
 
Hector 1
1
. Lee
 
I
. Immediate Background
 
The plan to be proposed in the following outline is the result of
 
discussions at the Conference of the California Folklore Society held a;
 
American River College in April, 1972.  At the business meeting luncheo:i
 
it became obvious--to me, at least--that many people in our Society, ha-r
ing
 
in mind the excellent example of Marjorie McLain's project at American :
liver
 
College, wanted something done along
; the following lines; (1) to awaken
 
community colleges and regional undergraduate universities t
o the need .or
 
trained instructors to assist with or to conduct properly disciplined a
i:ademic:
 
programs in folklore in response to the pre6,ent demand for ethnic studios and
 
multi-disciplined projects now emerging; (2) to persuade graduate schools that
'
 
part of their responsibility in training folklorists  might well be to .
3rovidf
f
 
opportunities for experience in applied folklore, such as working with commun­
 
ity groups and undergraduate students in the discovery and %nderstanding of
 
their own cultural materials; and (3) to enhance the role of the California
 
Folklore Society in coordinating or articulating the moveme
:zt of students
 
between graduate schools and community college courses or projects, witA a
 
view to providing valuable experience and personal contacts.
 
In a moment of enthusiasm I made such a proposal.  The apparent co:icensus
 
was highly favorable; hence, I must now follow through with a plan.  I I
nvite
 
reactions to it, particularly from the professors who design graduate c
lzrric-
ulums in folklore and mythology, the administrators in community colleges and
 
undergraduate universities who plan or approve ethnic or multi-cultural
 
studies in their institutions, and the officers of the California Folklore
 
Society, without whose endorsement and support the idea could not work.
 
II. Broader Background
 
At a plenary session of the American Folklore Society i
n Washing-t
oa,
 
D
. C
., November 13, 1971, Professor Richard 1
M
. Dorson (
Indiana Universi•;y)
 
conducted a panel on "The A
cademic ?
Future of Folklore."  (S ,a
e Journal o
:
 
American ;
,'
olklore Supplement, Ellen J. Stekert, Ed., May., 1
')72, pp. 104-125.)
 
I
lis introductory paper includes comments relevant to the subject here:
 
Let me first support my credo that Folklore should push for
 
the major, the minor, the M
.A., the Ph.D., in short the works....
 
The humanistic values in folklore studies are especi,.11y appealing
 
in the contemporary climate of opinion.. . The nation today is con-
cerned about its underprivileged, its poor, its blacks, its Appala-
chian whites t its ethnics, its Indians, its Chicanos, its forgotten
 
and left-nuts.  While I will not equate the folk with the "lower
 
orders," as the Victorian folklorists were wont to do, I am ready
 
to see, and claim, plenty of opportunities f
or the folklorist among
 
such tradi --
ion-oriented groupso
 
The problem for the new doctor of folklore, and his sponsors, is to
 
persuade a department composed of doctors of English, or anthropology,
 
or history, or foreign lanfmuages, or music, to give him a home....
 
The question is, how do we get doctors of folklore onto the faculties
 
of many of the 2600 institutions of higher learning in the United
 
States?
 
In r
esponse to Professor Dorsone Professor Robert A
. Georges (
UCLA) made some
 
comrents also relevant here:
 
The recommendations that he makes are not new ones, 'or such tactics
 
as convincing deans and department chairmen that eve}-y educational
 
insti_tutioa should have at least one folklorist on i
:;s staff, working
 
for the establishment and implementation of folklore courses and "mini-
programs," and attempting to get budgetary support f
o
ur folklore studies
 
are all oli methods t
hat have succeeded in some places and failed in
 
others and which will continue to do so in the future.... So far as
 
instituting or adding courses or programs is concerned this is determined
 
by the desires and personalities of those who are doing the proposing
 
and upon the effectiveness with which they communicate with administrators.
 
And finally, comments by Professor Robert I
I
, Byington (
Point Park College,
 
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania):
 
The folklorist, whose purview, unlike that of other specialists 9 takes
 
in a sector of just about everything, is in an excellent position to take
 
part in, chair 9 or direct one of these enterprises f
.e., interdisciplinary
 
program
s which sehm 9 as I say, to be on the increase everywhereo.A.
 
Closely allied with this trend is what might be called the Ethnic
 
Recognition Movement; the melting pot is on its way out, and what did
 
not melt is soon, we hope, t
o be rediscovered, define d and revitalize d
 
This process, which will go on for years, in and out of the academy,
 
must necessarily involve the folklorist as a key figure.  His skills
 
and knowledge are probably more important to this movement than those
 
of any other discipline, and the support he can provide through formal
 
instruction and work in the field is bound to elicit more and more
 
respect.
 
The need for folklorists is increasing in our western states.  In California
 
the Community Colleges are moving rapidly toward developing curriculums in
 
American studies.;,
 Black Studies, Ethnic Studies, Multi-Cultural Studies,
 
Y
 
-3-
Ch:i
_cano Literature, Folklore and Mythology, Oral History projects, Ethnic
 
Ar;s and Crafter--many approaches reflecting various local interests.  In-
service training for teachers of such courses in the lower schools is
 
oVicially provided for in a recent addition to the California Education
 
Code, as follows:
 
SEC. 3
64  Section 13345 of the Education Code, as amended and
 
renumbered) by Chapter 438 of the Statutes of 1
971, is amended
 
and renumbered to read:
 
1
3344. On and after July 1
, 1
974, each school with a substantial
 
population of students of diverse ethnic backgrounds shall provide
 
an in-service preparation program designed to prepare teachers and
 
other professional school service personnel to understand and
 
effectively relate to the history, culture, and current problems
 
of these :
students and their environment.  For purposes of this
 
article a school shall be considered to have a substantial popula-
tion of students of diverse ethnic backgrounds where 25 percent or
 
more of a
3.1 the students in the school are of diverse ethnic
 
backgrounds.
 
SEC. 3
7.  Section 1
3346 of the Education Code, as amended and
 
renumbered by Chapter 4
3$ of the Statutes of 1971, is amended
 
and renumbered to read:
 
13344.3.  The Department of education shall develop a list of
 
approved courses which shall be considered acceptable for meeting
 
the requirements of this article.  The department shall cause a
 
list of approved courses to be published and distributed to
 
interested teachers, administrators, and governing boards of
 
school districts.  The department shall be responsible for
 
coordinating the efforts of school districts and colleges to
 
develop adequate course offerings to satisfy the requirements
 
of this article.
 
1
3344.2  In-service programs designed to fulfill the require-
ments of this article may include, but need not be limited to,
 
courses offered by community colleges and colleges and universi-
ties approved by the State Board of Education.  A district may
 
provide a
r; in-service program consisting in whole or in part of
 
preparation other than college courses.
 
Such a program shall be developed cooperatively with the
 
Department of Education, and shall have prior approval of the
 
Department of Education.  An in-service program which meets the
 
intent of this article shall encompass the history, culture,
 
and current problems of the students of diverse ethnic background.
 
All college courses approved by the Department of Education
 
for the purposes of this article shall be acceptable for salary
 
credit purposes by any school district.  District in-service pro-
grams shall specify an amount of equivalent credit which shall
 
be acceptable for salary credit purposes in the school district
 
providing the in-service program.
 
1
3344.3  The Department of Education shall provide in its
 
budget f
or the necessary funds to employ appropriate staff to
 
implement the intent of this article.
 
-4�
 
III. What the Graduate Schools Can Do
 
I hope we can persuade those graduate schools which offer M
. A
. or
 
Ph.D. programs in folklore to include in their curriculum (not necessarily
 
required, but acceptable if a student chooses to go this route) a substantial
 
block of work in directed field or intern experience in applied folklore.
 
1. For one quarter or semester a graduate student could be assigned
 
to a community college or university or a school district to work
 
in applied folk culture projects, f
or example:
 
(a) Teach courses or conduce workshops in folklore,
 
mythology, or ethnic traditions.
 
(b) Assist in or actually develop studies and projects
 
in local folk-group lore among students or teachers.
 
(
c) Assist in or develop community oriented projects for
 
the college in order to bring the college and the
 
ethnic groups it serves closer together.
 
(d) Assist with or produce folk plays, dance fes'rivals,
 
local history pageants, radio or T
it documentitries, etc.
 
(e) Assist with or direct collecting, exhibiting  and
 
interpreting elements of the material culture of a
 
community, occupation, or ethnic group.
 
2. The graduate student would work under the general supervision o-2 
his professor, but would also be considered an adjunct member of
 
the faculty of the college to which he is assigned, working in
 
a department or administrative unit there.
 
3. Placement in the assignment could be arranged eithe:r by his
 
graduate studies professor or by the California Fol
:-
,lore Societ;r.
 
4. '
ihe student should earn credit toward his degree for such work,
 
the amount to be decided by his professor or graduate departmen:.
 
If f
unds are available, he should also receive paymant for his
 
expenses and an honorarium or salary for his servic?s.
 
I
i/o What the Community
► Colleges and Undergraduate Universities Can Do
 
A trained graduate student of folklore serving as an intern or asEistant
 
should be a welcome addition to the faculty of a community college or
 
university.  He could provide the discipline of the folklorist to projects
 
and activities for which regular facult.
i
r members are not trained or do not
 
have sufficient time, and his presence would stimulate more personal a
xed
 
---
meaningful contact with those students whose cultural backgrounds have
 
set them apart from the traditional college curriculums.  In a recent
 
letter Professor t
;ayland D
. Hand wrote, "With you, I have :
bong believed
 
that much of the mischief and trouble, not to say tragedy, that young
 
people get into c
ould be avoided if their energies and talents had earlier
 
been riveted on some of the more basic aspects of their lives. But particularly
 
activities and concerns with the family, local community, and local. history.
 
Much of the difficulties that befall young people, I feel, comes from their
 
rootless existence." ;
.
'hat is what the provisions in the California '
Lducation
 
Code r cited above, are all about; and the teacher who can get closest to the
y
 
heart of the problem is the folklorist.
 
Community colleges, therefore, might c
onsider the Following:
 
1
. For one quarter or semester ; under this plan the college would
 
accept the graduate student a
re an assistant, intern, or adjunct
 
faculty member.
 
2
. The proposed projects, activities, or courses would be agreed
 
upon in advance.  The graduate student would be assigned to a
 
local faculty member for immediate supervision s and his activities
 
would be subject to the institution's policies, procedures, and
 
budgetary limitations. To the greatest extent possible within
 
these controls, however, he would be free to experiment, conduct
 
research
., and utilize available resources for the success of his
 
assignment.
 
3
. With the aid of selected graduate students, the colleges in
 
California can develop courses to meet the demands cited above
 
for in-service training of teachers in ethnic culture.
 
It might b
e reasonable to hope that if the graduate student and the
 
institution to which he is assigned find the experience mutually satisfactory,
 
and if the courE
.es or projects lead to the establishment of a new faculty
 
Y 
'
.tion, the student may be considered to fill it. This arrangement,
 
however, should not imply any commitment on either side.
 
V. What the California Folklore Society Can Do
 
The role of the California Folklore Society. as seen in this plan, would
 
be that of expediter.  Thus the Society would gain both visibility and
 
influence in applied folklore here in the West.  The discipline of the
 
folklorist would be up-graded, a needed service would be performed both
 
for public education and for graduate students, to whom we do after all
 
-
6-
have a professional responsibility.  And a closer relationship would be
 
established between the graduate schools and the community colleges or t
he
 
school districts electin-
, to participate.
 
To coordinate this long-term (
or possibly endless) project, the
 
California folklore Society should appoint a standing committee.  In its
 
initial stages the plan could be guided by the regional vice presidents.
 
the committee's duties might be as follows:
 
1. To see that this plan (
or any such plan as might emerge) is brought
 
to the attention of (1) the folklore departments of graduate schools
 
with encouragement for them to enter into the operation; and (2) the
 
community colleges and school districts with encoura€;ement f
or them
 
to utilize these services.  As a pilot program perhaps only three or
 
four graduate students should be selected for an equally limited
 
number of projects.
 
2
. To provide leadership (
if it is wanted) in negotiating the terms
 
of the intern's assignment, including (a) payment of expenses, f
ree
 
housing if possible, and other remuneration available; and (b) t
le
 
nature of the assignment as the community college or district
 
foresees its needs and as graduate students are found qualified
 
for specific assignments.
 
3. To be available for consultation if their help is recuested, but to
 
remain apart from the program if they are not needed.
 
4
. To explore ways to give recognition to undergraduate students whc
 
might make valuable contributions to folklore studies or multi-
cultural understanding as a result of this plan.
 
5
. To solicit grants-in-aid for the implementation and E
;upport of
 
the plan.
 
VI. What I Can Do to Help-7If I Am Needed 
As the formulator of this plan, I feel an obligation to contribute
 
whatever I can to its success if it is adopted.  In June, 19
'3, I shall
 
ratire.  My writing and speaking commitments will probably i
r
.
.crease, but
 
there are a few things I can offer to do if I am needed:
 
1. I could contact (with a form letter, I suppose) some 200 community
 
colleges and universities in California, Hawaii, Oregon, Washington,
 
Nevada, Idaho, and Utah outlining the plan and offering the
 
services of the California Folklore aociety.
 
2. I could offer to visit a college, if it is interested
. in the plan,
 
and (a) make a speech to the student body illustrating the
 
I
 
-7-
interesting aspects of folklore, or (b) meet with administrators
 
and faculty to discuss possible projects.  Through local funds the
 
community college could probably defray the expenses of the visit.
 
3
. I could meet with the California Folklore Society committee and help
 
coordinate the correspondence involved in the plan.
 
4
. In institutes, workshops, and summer sessions I could work with
 
secondary school and community college teachers on the uses of
 
folklore in the schools, with a view to stimulating an interest
 
in working with graduate schools and CFS on this plan.
 
s
 
This is essentially what I had in mind when I mentioned it at the CFS
 
meeting last April.  I submit it now to the officers of the Society for
 
whatever use they may wish to make of it.

HAPS one benefit of one regional folklore society would
 
be the possibilities for greater articulation between members thanks to
 
a
. single maiLing list.  The threat does exist that allegiance to a
 
larger group (
i.e., the trans-Mississippi West) would inevitably mean a
 
loss in participation in regional or state €olkl re societies and regional
 
scholarly meetings such ar
s egional
 and R
IZILA,
,  This .
latter loss would be
 
serious indeed, for the parental roots of folklore in American were
 
nurtured by literary societies and scholars; to cut off our participation
 
here would be not only to impoverish ourselves, but also deny our graduates
 
a forum in which to try theiz waugs, a place wherein
, they might seek ,
jobs,
 
The first
. problem I see would be finding a solution to h
im dile m
ma
 
which faces the CFS, and would bedevil
. a WFS:  how to remedy the inward-
looking aspect of the Ca?i£orniamcentered group.  Control and group spirit
 
would have to be altered to reflect a
. more general, flexible, Western outlook,
 
o
The second problem:  remediation of t
he editorial policy and outlook
 
of Western
. Fo'
,'
 k
l ore a
 .
. Resolution of the function of the 3
 ourral a
vd e
ra-
hascem
+eut of the publication owould be necessary to aptly reflect a
 
broader Western orientation.
 
.
."The editorial board of western Folklore must be both expanded i
n
 
number and made more oxpr
-nsive in ou$1ook.
 
.
..The fourth problem:  attendance at sc i
edulod WFS
Professional folklorists plus "rank and file members" ma ymeetings.
 indeed not
 
attend meetings of a NFS which are held
. outside California. This issue
 
was brought before the last meeting of PAPC, and i
s sheer hogwash, i
 
would hope that g WFS voiald xxist for soaething more then a select few
 
of the "professional folklorists" based dither at UCB or UCLA, and that
 
a broader meW3ership base be vigorously sought:.  i
►
 entings should rather
 
be viewed as opportunities for the raak and f
i
.1s to participate to
 
become interested; for local schools and JC's or four-your colleges to
 
become involved.  If tr "el money in California Higher Education has been
 
restricted, then for the sake of fuxtherauce of the folklore profession,
 
California folklorists may have to travel now at thoi
.r own expense and
,
 
recover the costs later as businoss deductions via their income taxes
 
.
 ,
,
 .
The fifth problem:  state support might be more difficult to
 
s
a
ge once the society became not CPS but WFS.  Financial support is
 
always a sticky matter and Kill always be.  Indeed Western Folklore is
 
presently being subsidised beyond the monies broug'sh
 '
In
 Sy mem ers ip.
 
On the other hadd, k
'F used to offer a line bargain by which, at a slight
 
discount, individuals night subscribe to both WF and JAF. With others,
 
in this manuer, did I become a subscriber to both journals.  Increased
 
advertising might well be sot:ghte  Again, F
rith m broader membership and
 
with O
FF truly reflecting a broader society, subscriptions to a high
 
level journal well editod should pick up..
 
.
 
Finally, I believe that compromise seems best.  I am located w
ithin
 
a territory the size of both Czechslo°rak e and Hungary
'.  In my region 1
 
am alone=-no help, no competition, but the area i
s vast.  Considerable
 
interest i
s building for the collection of local history and museum
 
artifacts.  A viable Vashington Folklore Society might well serve Washing
 
Ionians as a common meeting ground where common discoveries or problems
 
might be shared or resolved.  Still more, the gap between the professional
 
and the amateur might be lessened if each
. also had an outlet, a Trans
 
Mississippi
, (
Western) Folklore Society.  And opportunities for each state
 
society to host meetings of the WFS would serve to counter narrow and
 
ethnocentric outlooks while encouraging a greater appreciation for the
 
riches of the discipline.  In short, each organization could complement
 
mutual efforts to discover, record, transcribe and annotate and finally
 
explicate the lore and life of the American West.  A vast job, far vaster
 
energies are needed for the task.

s.YOU may of course quote me, but I should be quo
ted as  ma king  
these remarks personally, not as chairman of the U of A Folklore Committee.
 
Even after Wayland Hand's outline of the possible problems in his letter,
 
I do not see that we ate affected adversely.  You realize that we are not
 
a Society, but an inter-departmental faculty committees encouraging theses,
 
courses, and activities related to folklore at the University of Arizona,
 
and throughout the stage, through school collections, clubs, etc,
,, and of
 
course through the worm of our own students, thus building up an archive of
 
folklore  here at the university which mainly concerns Arizona but also
 
other places.  V a student interviews her Michigan l
 umbercamp grandfather,
 
f
ine; or if one does a term paper on the folklore within his own f
su
-nily or
,
 
in his New England town.  We don't build fences around Arizona.  We don't
 
build fences within Arizona either.  We were delighted when Arizona
 
Friends of Folklore started at Northern Arizona University at F
lagstaff.
 
In fact I promptly joined up:
,  It seems to me that anything that gives
 
wider perspective on our  subject is good, and the more cooperation in
 
folklore activities the better.
 
If we were a Society, I would have more worries along the lines of
 
the problems Wayland Hand pointed out in his original letter.  I would
 
feel that the dissolution of local and state societies would indeed be d
:
-
.-
 
sastrous,
,  But would  that be necessary?  Could not the larger unit
; be in
 
the nature of a league?  It could even be called the League of Western
 
Folklore Societies, within which each one: would continue its work---though
 
i
t would be better to work out a
. name with that idea; but in which the
 
words Western Folklore.would come f
irst to simplify bibliographical and
 
indexing problems and to correlate with the name of the magazine.
 
About state and educational institutions giving support to a Western
 
Folklore Society:  Do they to .
s
tate societies?  The University of Arizona
 
of
` course gives support to our folklore committee (
student typists, tape
 
recorders and tape, copying of tapes, etc.) but I am sure such support
 
could not be legally given to any o-r
ganiza
.t on outside the University, any
 
more than money given to the Center at UCLA could be g
iven for use outside
 
of that University context.  To summarize, I do not see that the
 
University of Arizona Folklore Committee would be affected by the organizat
.i
 
of a Western Folklore Society in any unfavorable way.,

Thanks for your warm invitation.  I
fn
i afraid I
'll have to
 
take a rain check.  After the UC extension trek I had to go to
 
Indianapolis for a meeting of Popular Culture Association which
 
devoted a session to my book.  The whole thing was fun but
 
exhausting and I
'm just going to recuperate for the rest of
 
the semester.  The PCA meeting was rewarding and it was a
 
delight to see that my treatment of the Lomaxes still drives
 
the neanderthals right up the wall.
 
I would like to talk to you some time about a lot of
 
things, but especially the idea you mentioned to me about
 
setting up a c
enter for t
he study of the traditional arts.
 
I think we're ready for that here and I
'd like you to be
 
involved in it.  Do -
rou have a current address for Alan?
 
I
'm also s
ending a copy of my book.  I still don't know
 
whether I
TM ever sent ,
you one.  In any case ,
you can have a
 
spare.  Come and see us this summer if you can.
 
Love from all of us e

I sneaked your name onto the Sour Dou

list and hope that you are now au courant with the affairs of
 
the California Folklore Society.  How about paying us a visit
 
at the Dominguez Hills meeting May 18-19 and see what's going
 
on for yourself?  You've been missed by many.
 
I see by the neirspapers that you're on '
"
'am Hinton's
 
peripatetic series of programs for the University of California.
 
I hope Sam has hit you up for a paper for CFS; he's program
 
chairman this year.
 
Anyway, do come, paper or no.  Maybe we could
. even
 
get in a whole ten minute conversation, do you suppose?

Enclosed please find copies of the proposed notice for the first
 
number of the newly constituted Sourdough Crock and a copy of my letter
 
to Professor E
. C
. Ehrensperger of the Place-Name Liaison Committee of
 
the American Name Society and the American Dialect Society.  I believe
 
these two documents tell their own story.  I am not sure at all how many
 
people will volunteer for this work, but if there are two or more
 
applicants, it seems to me that some machinery should be devised to
 
determine who would be best qualified to head up the California Place-
Name Survey.  Stewart i
s getting pretty old now, and I do not know
 
whether he still has the energy to do much, but he certainly should be
 
given the opportunity to pass on the credentials of prospective applicants.
 
He definitely i
s interested in the effort, and I am sure will help
 
in any way that he can.  A copy of my letter to him i
s enclosed, so you
 
will know exactly what has been going on.
 
Yours sincerely,

Dear George:
 
I cannot lay hands on the letter you wrote me several months ago
 
from San Francisco, so I hope you will not be unduly inconvenienced by
 
a letter directed to the Department of English at Berkeley.
 
The two enclosures tell their own story.  Ed Ehrensperger has been
 
after me for a good long while to take a more active interest than I have
 
in Place-Name Studies, but I have kept putting him off.
 
I thought that one way to bring the whole question to a head and
 
thus open the way to a potential solution, would be to advertise for
 
parties interested in heading up the Place-Name Survey for California.
 
Assuming that there were two or three people applying, it seems to
 
c
ue that some mechanism would have to be set up within California itself
 
to determine who the best qualified person would be.  It i
s for that
 
reason that I have called this matter to the attention of the President
 
of the California Folklore Society as well as to you, the dean of all
 
scholars in the state interested in the field of onomastics.  Even though
 
the applications would go directly to Ed Ehrensperger, they could be
 
referred back to the proper California authority for a final determination.
 
I do not suppose that there will be very many applications, and
 
there might be as few as only two or three.  In this latter event one
 
person could be named chairman of the California Place-Name Survey, and
 
the other applicants could become members of the committee.
 
With regard to people throughout the state interested in all
 
place-names that you know more about than anyone else, you yourself
 
should draw them into the deliberations.  What about geographers, historians,
 
linguists?
 
Professor George R
. Stewart -2-
 November 1
, 1972
 
Since the California Folklore Quarterly and Western Folklore helped
 
to further Place-Name Studies in the early days, it i
s perhaps fitting
 
that t
he California Folklore Society offer its services in the selection
 
of the best person in the state to head up this work.  Although I have
 
not talked with Professor Hawes, I am sure that she i
s in a
ccord and that
 
she will lend her good offices to any effort made.  I guess, then, that
 
this i
s where the matter rests : (1) interested parties will apply
 
directly to Ehrenspe  er and (
2) he will return the applications to me for
 
proper delivery to (
3� a proper board of review, which I sincerely baps
 
you would be able to head up.  Perhaps at last with this very clumsy
 
mechanism we can get things started.
 
I trust that all goes well with you and I hope to hear from you at
 
your convenience . I am sure that you must know Ed Ehrensperger, and he,
 
likewise, would be pleased to have some statement from you that he could
 
pass on to his colleagues at the New York meetings at Christmastime.
 
Yours sincerely,

Dear Professor Ehrensperger:
 
You will see by the enclosed notice, which will be carried in the
 
newsletter of the California Folklore Society, the Sourdough Crock, that
 
the Society i
s lending its good offices to the securing of some scholar
 
interested in heading up the Place-Name Survey of the United States for
 
the State of California.  I do not know exactly when this will appear,
 
but at any rate you will be able to report to your colleagues at the
 
New York meetings that we are finally starting to stir out here.
 
I was in touch with George R
. Stewart several months ago, and I am
 
sure that he i
s as eager as I am to see that California i
s well represented,
 
and I feel sure that he would be willing to help screen the prospective
 
candidates should there be two or more applicants.  There are other people
 
within the California Folklore Society, as well as people from such
 
disciplines as geography, history, linguistics, and the like who would be
 
willing to see that the proper person is selected.
 
If I were you I would not make any decision until adequate time
 
had passed for a proper review of credentials.  I am sending a copy of
 
this letter, together with the notice itself, to George R
. Stewart, now
 
retired from Berkeley, but living in San Francisco.  Professor Stewart i
s
 
very much interested, but I do not know how active he i
s these days.  At
 
any rate we both no doubt will be hearing from him.
 
I am also sending a copy of this letter to you to Professor Bess
 
Lomax Hawes, President of the California Folklore Society, who teaches in
 
the Department of Anthropology at California State University, Northridge,
 
Northridge, California  9132+.  She may also be in communication with you.
 
The Society does not meet until next April, so if we are to act as
 
a body in making the proper determination, things will have to wait until
 
that time.

Dear Mr. Karty:
 
It was a real pleasure to meet you last Friday and
. to talk
 
with you at such length about your work in onomastics and especially
 
about your interest in the California Place-Name Survey.
 
I have written Professor
. Bess Lomax Hawes, President of the
 
California Folklore Society about y
,ou and your work, as well as
 
Professor George R
. Stewart, now retired and living in San Francisco.
 
I have sent each of them a copy of your curriculum vitae. 
I was pleased to learn that y
,ou plan to attend the annual
 
meeting of the California Folklore Society at the California State
 
College, Dominguez Hills, on Saturday, May 19, and I have instructed
 
Professor Hawes to make sure that you get copies of the program and
 
other instructions connected with the meeting.  If you can carry out
 
your intention of visiting San Francisco in the near future, it would
 
be an excellent idea for you to pay a call on Professor G
. R
. Stewart.
 
His address and telephone number are as follows:

automatically.
 
Please feel free to call on me if you have any questions.

March 1

With regard to Mr. Floryan R
. Karty, the retired CIA Onomatologist,
 
with whom I had lunch last Friday, there are interesting things to report.
 
Although he is 60 years of age, or slightly older, he is very well
 
preserved.  I judged him to be well under 50, perhaps as young as 4
5.
 
The enclosed curriculum vitae tells about his education and
 
generally about his professional career; so I won't have to go into any
 
of the details.
 
He has had very little, if any experience in place-name study,
 
but he seems generally conversant with the field of onomastics, and is
 
a member of the American Name Society.
 
He is a pensioner, but probably supplements his earnings by
 
teaching French and Russian.  The three-page sketch of his career is
 
perhaps pointed toward those interests rather than toward continuing
 
work in the field of his specialty.
 
He said he would be free to travel to different parts of the
 
state, and that he could cover a certain amount of out-of-pocket
 
expenses.  As we talked, however, it was apparent to me that he was
 
thinking of possible reimbursement in the event his work might
 
ultimately have commercial value.  This aspect was never put forward
 
very firmly, but it did dwell in the back of his mind, as it were.
 
As I told you over the phone, the nomination came from Professor
 
Byrd H. Granger, University of Arizona, who is the national chairman
 
of the American Place-Name Survey or whatever it is called.  Mr. Karty's
 
residence in the southern California area was called to Professor
 
Granger's attention by Elsden Smith, one of the leaders in American
 
Onomastic Study, and a past president of the American Name Society.
 
Apparently Karty had been helpful to Smith in one way or another over
 
the years.
 
My impression of him was very favorable.  He seemed to have
 
considerable insight and probity, and was able to ask a series of
 
very thoughtful and pertinent questions.  He seemed to have a
 
Professor Bess Lomax Hawes - 2
 March 1
3, 1
973
 
conservative, wait-and-see attitude.  This pleased me a lot, for I
 
have come to distrust people who rush into a project, making all sorts
 
of promises that can never be kept.
 
He said he would be pleased to attend the spring annual meeting
 
of the California Folklore Society at Dominguez Hills on Saturday, May 1
9.
 
Since George R
. Stewart is the leader in Place-Name Studies in
 
California, I think it would be very helpful if he could be present, but
 
I do not know his general state of health.  At any rate, I am sending
 
him an invitation to attend the meeting if he can do so.
 
Mr. Karty may have the opportunity of calling on Professor
 
Stewart in San Francisco on a trip which he may take in the near
 
future.  If this trip takes place, then there would be no necessity
 
for Professor Stewart's making a trip to Los Angeles.
 
I am also inviting Byrd Granger to attend the meeting.  She
 
is, as you know, very much interested in teaching of folklore in
 
junior colleges and high schools, and has run a very successful
 
teacher-training program the last few years at the University of
 
Arizona.
 
I can't think of anything else at the time except that we must
 
make sure Mr. Karty gets a copy of the program and other instructions
 
connected with the CFS meeting.

'm green at the j
ob;
 
I
'll try to do better next time.
 
However, the damage h
is been done.  I can only say that the Board, I
 
bolieve, was carried away by the prevailintr enthusiasra engendered by
 
the new potential we all saw for the development of folklore programs
 
in the Community Collegeo.  Most of us, I think, saw M rjorie quite
 
simply as a representative of a possible new constituency which should
 
have a voice on the Board -- not as an individual.  In retrospect, T
 
'
U
1
1
-ink we exercised poor jud,,�
j
uent.
 
w
Lowever, if it's an;T consolation to you at all, this episode has con-
vinced me to take two ste w which I hope will prevent and forestall
 
such hasty and ill-considered actions in future.  In the first place,
 
next year I an determined to abolish the t#zdition of the Board's meetin
 
at an early Saturday morning breakfast session.  There is never snough
 
tine to transact business properly; everyone i
, tired from the b
Lmquet
 
evenin
.4
° before, and everyone is anxious to rush through in order not to
 
miss any japers.  This coming
, year, I shall ask the Board to assemble
 
formally t
be
e ^the neeting at a time which will allow for a full three
 
hour se-03-on,  i
, necessary on the Thursday eveninC immediately precedin
.`
 
the meetin
;
- .
 
The second thin
.- I am determined on is the appointment of a proper
 
nominating co mittee far enough in adgan
.ce of the annual meeting so
 
they can give due consideration to the problem throu,?
�h corre pondence.
 
`
c are now too big and too busy an or{ anization to have our nomination;)
 
UOrked out at the last moment by people standing about in the hall
 
between papers.  T
oy own nomination, as I wrote you, was a totally spur-
of
 -the
 moment affair, and I am not at all sure I should have accepted,
 
h
czd
. I had time to consider the just dues of other more senior members.
 
in any event, I an wonderin{; if you ,till feel T
Lindly enough towards
 
the Society to be willin
,7
, to help in effecting these reforms?  :ould
 
you accept, for instance, appointment as chairman of the nominating
 
committee for next year, with the responsibility of selecting not only
 
a nominee to -replace Bob Georges, but also a new presidential candidate?
 
Since I will be out of the country on sabbatical for 1973-4, 1 shall
 
not accept re-election, even if nominated.  Further, there will be the
 
two new student vice-presidents, who should also be chosen with rather
 
more consideration than we gave this year.  If you'd consider it, perhaps
 
you could let me know some time this s
tammer, as I should want to select
 
the other members of the committee with due regard to geographic and
 
inter-disciplinary factors, as well as people with some degree of exper-
ie.:
.ce t
;ithin the Society; perhaps you would have some suggestions €  to
 
ghop1hese might be.  Please think it over.  I should value your help.

Dear Bess:
 
Bless you for such a mature responsible reply to
 
such a petulant, self centered letter; tho I can't really
 
be honest with myself and feel too sorry. I
've watched
 
Marjorie with the folk singer series at Davies this
 
spring, and the poor girl just doesn't have the background
 
to handle it. She persisted in being cute withe  students
 
and we saw no interplay, no questions, no discussions, so
 
that the performers were put to a 3 hour task..but I must
 
say they didn't seem to mind. Why don't we in the state
 
university system try to same, i
.e. get a  half dozen
 
really good performers to hit several campuses on an
 
extension class basis. We could take advantage of our
 
multiple campus system and provide some really stimulating
 
experiences.
 
As for y
,our suggestion regardiig the nominating
 
committee, of cour ,e I
'll be glad to serve. Alan Dundes
 
would make a good member, but he also might be better as
 
a president if you're adamant in stepping down. Hector Lee
 
might be cudg&led into serving, and maybe Al Friedman..
 
I
'm taking off a month to visit my brother in Vienna, but
 
will be back about July 16, and look forward to hearing from
 
you. Thanks again for a letter more mature than the one
 
that occasioned it.
 
Yours,

Dear '
-
,ayland:
 
I
'm writing to ask if you possibly have time to bail me out of
 
a difficulty.  p
is you may remember, at that sort of rump DFS
 
board meeting we held at UCLA some time in June, I said I would
 
i
rrite the various western folklore societies and ask their reac-
tions to the proposed name change of CFS to the '
.estern -blklore
 
.
:ociety.
 
:
'
ell, I have tried to produce a suitable letter,aand I simply
 
can't bri m; it off.  The basic problem is, I think, that i know
 
too little about the histoi-j of CFS, not to mention the other
 
-.
.
r
e;tern societies and the South-Eastern organization which, if
 
i recall correctly, we were going to suggest as a precedent.
 
x
^11 of my drafts come out wrong -- too vague, too apologetic,
 
too domineering, too something.
 
Could you possibly find time in your incredibly busy sehsdule
 
to take this project over?  I am sure Barbara La
:Pan would be
 
glad tohhelp with the dogsbody part of it (arranging to have
 
it copied, mailed out and so forth) as she is vitally concerned
 
with getting; reactions on this subject for the Crock.  And I
 
certainly don't mind i
 riting Sig Eisner, M an _
'
handes and other
 
society members 'or position statements.  It's just these out-
of-state people that have me buffaloed, since I know almost none
 
of them, and have absolutely no idea how they might react to what.
 
Please at least think it over, and if you find you can't manage
 
it, I
'll of course understand.
 
The Institute here at Portland State seems to be going well enou,,h.
 
I
'm trying; to catch up with
 load of back work and find that com-
mutinE to the beach for weekend-, plus my teachinC, plus whatever
 
fragments of time I snatch for other affairs keeps me well occupied.
 
The Institute will be over by August fifth, and I intend to spend
 
the next three i
reelLO at the house I
'm sharing with my daughter and
 
her family at the beach, which should bri m the summer to a pleasant
 
end.  I hope you manage to find yourself some vacation time as well.

At t
hat t
ime you told me about the up=coming California Folklore

w

hat I might be
 
i
nterested i

ight.
 
I
n any event I would very much l
ike to be p
lugged i
nto when the meeting
 
w
ill be, where, etc.
 
I
n addition, two of my colleagues f
rom Cal State, Hayward, would a
lso
 
l
ike to know when t
he meeting w
ill be, and they, t
oo, have done
 
some i
nteresting work which might be p
resented.  One of them was
 
at the AFS meeting on the s
ame panel w
ith me, though he had left
 
by the t

alked.  He i

Dear Scott:
 
We are beginning to swing -- belatedly and ponderously
 
as usual -- into "ction.  Concerning your committee assi g
nment,
 
�robably you and/or Bari should enquire first of all from Professor
 
ichard A. r
 euss, Chairman of the Oral History Committee of the
 
American Folklore Society, Department of Anthropology, Wayne State
 
---- `
Jniversity, Detroit, Michigan.  elan Landes might also be of help
 
here.
 
Also, please let me know if you have not received a copy
 
of Hector bee's proposal for expanding folklore stddies into the
 
community college system (and resultant jobs for graduate students).
 
It should interest you, and you should have some things to say about
 
it. If you've seer
, it, do write Hector your reactions; he's not
 
gotte n much feed-back so far from anyone. If you haven't gotten a
 
copy, let me know and I
'll get one off to you ri"ht away.

Dear Bari:
 
(
I
 
a
te seem to be swinging into action finally in our usual
 
belated and ponderous fashion.  Concer�,ing your committee assi Cgnmert,
 
I
've written Scott suggesting that Richard A. Feuss, Chairman of the
 
Oral History Committee, American ;
olklore Society, Wayne State Univer-
 
\�-J sity, Detroit, Michigan should be consulted; he's in the Department
 
,of Anthropolotg, I believe.  Perhaps a phone conversation between
 
j
,you and Scott is indicated so that you can coordinate; if
 you can't
 
wangle this through the tie line at UCLA charge it to me (EX 6-2982).
 
In my note to Scott, I also suggested that talking to Ellen Steckert
 
V
i
'
 and Alan I
t
ijndes might be helpful; I am  sure
 that
 D.K.,
 Wayland
 and  
Bob Georges should be consulted also.
 
I hope you have seen Hector':: memorandum; please let me
 
know if you haven't and I
'll get you a copy. Perhaps you could drop
 
him a note; I gather the response so far has not been exactly deaf-
ening.

 (

an come, we will, of course, be absolutely delighted
..  But if you
 
_
'cannot, would it be possible for you to send down a statement of
.
 
the general state of affairs with Western Folklore either to me or
 
I to D.K. Wilgus, so that we can include the topic in our agenda?
 
A statement of the kind you presented at the meeting at American

�

otty problems l
'ooming on the horizon for

�Dear Hector:
 
Hector Lee, Dean
 
Sonoma State College

cleaning off my desk at the end of the semester last week, I came
 
,
,� oss your proposal to the California Folklore Society, and realized
 
to r
ay dismay that 1 had mentally drafted you several letters about it,
 
but never written a
. one.
 I apologize in spades; surely the Society
 
never had such a well-meaning but ineffectual president.
 It is a
 
;
nificentiy thought out proposal, humane in content but with a weather
 
out for the practicalities, and your own generous offer of time and
 
istance to top it all off.  The Society owes you a standing vote of
 
nks, and I am sure you will get it at Dominguez Hills.
 
was speaking to Sam Hinton today on matters programmatic, and he said
 
was writing you to discuss how your proposal might best be integrated
 
o the program (possibly scheduling a panle discussion or the like
 
for to the business meeting), and it turned out that he had not seen
 
a copy, only heard of its existence.  1 am sending him a xerox today,
 
but this led me to wonder to whom you had sent copies?  Barbara is print-
'ing it in the next issue of the Crock (to come o-Af the presses next
 
week), but we are still hearing from irate members who have not yet
 
r�peived their copy of the first re-issue, mailed almost two months ago.
 
l
i
e
e
  state of second-class bulk mailing being what it is, would it not
 
e well for me to circulate some of the most active members with dittoed
 
opies so as to be sure they have a chance to examine it before the
 
eeting?  If you could drop me a line as to how extensive your own
 
mailing was, I
'd be glad to take care of it.
 
One further thing, I am breaking with precedent and calling the annual
 
meeting of the Board for the night before the Dominguez Hills session
 
(
Thursday, May 17th).  We have too many irons in the fire to dispose
 
of our business during the traditional Saturday breakfast meeting, it
 
seems to me.  Could you possibly join us an evening early?  That way
 
we could discuss just how the proposal could most effectively be handled
 
at the business meeting on Saturday.  Please do come; we need you and
 
greatly want you with us for whatever time you can spare.
 
Yours,

From:  Bess Lomax Hawes, President
 
California Folklore Society
 
Every president, it seems to me, should be allowed a few attempts
 
at innovation.
 I have for some time been concerned over the infor-
mality of the methods used for arriving at nominations to the Board
 
of the California Folklore• Society, and have decided to try to correct
 
the situation by weighing in with a bit of presidential authority.
 
We are now simply too big and too complex an association to pursue
 
our fine old custom of fixing up a slate while standing around in the
 
hall two minutes before the business lunch.
 
I therefore have decided to appoint you as a nominating committee
 
with the responsibility of preparing, in advance, a slate of officers
 
for consideration by the membership at our 1973 meeting at Dominguez
 
Hills.  The Board positions which will need to be filled are:
 
President
 
Vice-President, south  (
to replace Robert Georges)
 
Student Vice-President, north
 
Student Vice-President, south
 
I apologize for selecting such an unconventional number of people
 
for your committee; it is difficult to come up with a combination
 
which adequately represents our geographical and sub-disciplinary
 
variety.  I hope matters don't come to a tie vote, and that you can
 
reach consensus with a minimum of correspondence.
 I am appending a
 
list of committee member addresses for your convenience, plus the
 
addresses of the two current student vice-presidents, in case you
 
would like to consult with them.
 I must also tell you that I must
 
reg
.Eetfully decline to stand for re-election as president, since I
 
expect to be on sabbatical for the year 1
973-4.
 
Best of luck, and please let me know if I can help in any way.  Also,
 
if for any reason you are unable to serve on this committee, please
 
let me know as soon as possible.

I
've been o
t) s
abbatical leave s
ince January and as a result
 
am just now getting to correspondence that I should have responded
 
to months ago.  I have received no further word on the exact
 
time of the meetings--or if I have it is still in Provo waiting
 
for the s
ecretary to forward it.  In this s
ame mail I a
;
,� s
ending
 
my nominations for officers to Roland Dickison, but s
ince I
 
will not be able to attend the meetings, it may b
e b
est to replace
 
me on the committee.
 
As far as responding to the issue of the proposed V
Iestern
 
Folklore Society, my excuse is much weaker.  I got sick at A
:ustin
 
and had to leave early, but evidently not early enough since I
 
had pneumonia by the t
ime I got home.  Recovering from that,
 
completing the s
emester at BYU, and g
etting ready to leavXe in
 
January somehow pushed everything else out of -:v .
hind.  Still,
 
as soon as I got s
ettled here I should have caught up with my
 
correspondence b
efore g
etting so involved in L
iy research.
 
About the proposed merger--I originally voted for it, but
 
now no longer favor it.  First, I think it would weaken the
 
suprort of California lay members if the name were changed, and
 
I think you have to have that suppor^�
 Second, you have had
 
large numbers of California student ? M W
Iparticipating, and I
 
doubt that they would be able to t
r Ael to Salt Lake City for
 
meetings.  ?
o
de could ; or course, make up part of the loss with
 
the attendance of our own students, but I
'm sure we couldn't
 
produce as many as we would lose, particularly s
ince almost all
 
the folklore students in Utah are undergraduates.  Third, we
 
have fought hard these last three years to ,
_
s
trengthen our Society.
 
Under a kind of affiliate a
rrangel
i
ient we are now meeting jointly
 
with the Utah Historical Society and in the last two meetings
 
have had about 200 people out for our s
ession.  I certainly do
 
not want to do anything to jeopardize what ,
i
e hnve -
.
corked so
 
hard to accor
:
,plish.  The only proposal I would vote for is the
 
"possible compromise" which establishes a re ional organization
 
while leaving state societies intact.
 
You have my permission to quote r
a
r
e in any debate that
 
develops.  When I took leave, I resigned as president and Jan
 
Brunvand took over, so I can no longer speak officially, but
 
I rather suspect that Jan would share my vievis.  But whether he
 
does or not, in our sate meetings I will fight any proposal
 
to t
ake away our autonomy.
 
Again, 11m sorry for the d
- lay in answering.  I
'm enclosing
 
an item from one of my students.  I think it interesting how close
 
this Dutch game is to one of the games in your film.

Family Game
 
Cathy Richards, 25 was born in Salt Lake City.
 She grew
 
up in Salt Lake and now teaches third grade in Magna.
 
She graduated from BYU.
 Her family was quite close and
 
had many games, some of which were of Dutch Origin.
 
"As we were growing up, a special activity at our
 
family parties was a game called "Grandma Hickety-
flinch died".
 It is an old Dutch game that my grand-
fatt
ier learned from his grandfather in Holland and he
 
passed it on to us.
 
Everyone sits in a circle.  The head person says
 
"Grandma Hickety Flinch died".
 The person next to him
 
says "How did she die?"  The head person replies "like
 
this" and he pats his knee with his hand.
 The dialogue
 
and patting continues around the circle until it comes
 
back to the head person.  The he starts over patting
 
both legs with both hands.
 It keeps going around
 
with the following activities- Stamp one foot; stamp
 
both feet; shake head;  standup,  sit down,  turn around.
 
At the end the head person says she d9ed "Like this"
 
and he collapses.

Dear Bess:
 
hank you for accepting my suggestions and passing them on.
 
And I am delighted that you are already planning for 1972.  With
 
Noland Jickison in charge of the program you have an old pro and a
 
man I respect very much.
 Also I remember the American River people
 
at Fullerton.
 They were young and full of enthusiasm.
 So it looks
 
as if we shall have an excelle
nt meeting.
 
I liked your communique.
 -
.t is very good for those who are
 
officers in the Association not only to know what is going on but
 
to feel that they are being given a part to play and even more a
 
potential voice if they feel like raising one.
 r
ill that is good for
 
the Association.
 
My own summer so far has been spent filling out applications
 
for grants.
 I want to go to England in the fall of 1972 to study
 
Chaucer's astrolabe.
 In preparation I have been building astrolabes
 
and taking
; them out into the clear Arizona night sky to see w
i:at I
 
could learn.
 I delighted myself the other night by predicting the
 
rise of Mars at a certain time and direction and then going out to
 
watch it all come true.
 The only thing that puzzlAs me is how Chaucer
 
ever used an astrolabe in England, where thei
,r have about one or two
 
clear days a year.
 I hope to find out.
 
Yes, I did tell D. K. I would be a regional editor of WF.
 So
 
far I have not had many duties.
 In fact I have not had any. Therefore
 
until now I have been an excellent regional editor
 
Again, thanks for your kind answer to my carping.  All seems to
 
be working out very well.
 
aincerely,

Dear Bess:

Congratulations on becoming President of the California
 
Folklore Society.  You will be a good one.
 I knew that Wayland
 
wanted out, but he will always be around to give a helping hand
 
(
scratch the pun) when needed.  So will I
.
 And i
f ,
you feel like
 
asking either of us for advice or a favor, ,
you don't need to suffer
 
any wrench; we don't consider that you are invoking the spirit of
 
the dead--or if we are dead we still like to give out information.
 
About the bank account: yes, there was one.
 It was a savings
 
account with Bank of America amounting to something like '
$
350.
 
There were no withdrawals during my terms of office.
 I think that
 
Barney Norris has charge of the account, and he will have to get
 
the signatures of the new officers on the withdrawal authorization.
 
I am glad the Society is making plans to revive the Newsletter.
 
It doesn't have to be called the Sourdough Crock, and ,
you will probably
 
want to give it a new format--all that is uD  to you.
 I certainly have
 
no maternal protective feelings about it.
 I do h
-:ve a mailing list,
 
but by now it is out of date.
 My circulation was about 1166, but
 
that included everybody on the Western Folklore list (which I would
 
get from Norris once a year) and in addition a number of people who
 
were either personal friends or folklorists who were not members of
 
our  s
ociety.
 I used the College mailing permit, which cut down on
 
the postage significantly, but I reimbursed the College for it (through
 
the Foundation) out of my own pocket.  That would amount to about '
5
15
 
a mailing--sometimes 1
20.
 
When I was a Dean it was easy to put out the Crock.  My secretary
 
enjoyed doing the work on it.  Now that my office help is of the
 
Work Study variety,  it is not reliable; the last few issues of the
 
Crock I did myself.  The off-set printing and the cost of the paper
 
were carried by the College as a favor to me.  But sometimes it would
 
take a month for our busy Duplicating Service to get around to my

r
-
-2-
job, and I f
elt more and more embarrassed f
or asking them to do it.
 
'
hat's one reason I dropped it.
 
Writing t was fun, though invaria:)ly an issue would come due at
 
a t
ime I ha �something else that demanded a
ttention.  I kept up a
 
rather extensive correspondence with f
olklorist types, which gave
 
me news; that was pleasant when I c
ould dictate t
o a good staff of
 
secretaries.  The mailing was a j
ob.  Sometimes t
he ,work Study people
 
could help with that, though they made mistakes.  When the copies
 
came back from the printer they would have to be sorted according to
 
zip code, t
ied into bundles, identified by code--all according to the
 
rules of the Post Office.  Sometimes they bounced back on me.
 
But it was all worth the effort.  Whoever takes it over will
 
enjoy doing it--at least, f
or a while.  I can send you my Mailing fist
 
if ,
you want it, but Norris can send you one from WF j
ust as easily.
 
I
've rambled in general; undoubtedly you will have some more
 
specific questions as you go along.  But ,
you and whoever edits it
 
will wind up doin7
; it .
your own way, anyway--and that's as it should
 
be.
 
I plan t
o be around f
or the next meeting.
 
Ever thine,

I was so pleased that you were elected President of the
 
California Folklore Society on Saturday at Fullerton State College,
 
and I am grateful to you, as indeed the whole membership of the
 
Society is, for accepting this important post.
 
Having watched your work at reasonably close range for many
 
years, and having admired the quiet, yet forceful, way that you work,
 
I am sure that your leadership will redound to the prosperity and growth
 
of the California Folklore Society.
 
There are a couple of residual matters which I am calling to
 
your attention.  The first has to do with the Society's f
inancial deal-
ings with the University of California Press in Berkeley.  A copy of my
 
letter to the new Secretary-Treasurer of the Society, Mr. Lloyd G
. Lyman,
 
is self-explanatory.  I have a feeling that some of the imponderables in
 
the Financial Statement which I read at the Fullerton meetings will be
 
straightened out within a year's time.
 
The other matter had to be by-passed at Fullerton because of the
 
lateness of time.  The enclosed letter to me from John 0
. West, however,
 
is likewise self-explanatory.  I am writing him to inform him of the
 
change of officers in the California Folklore Society, and am writing a
 
sort of "
tip off" letter to Sam Hinton by way of anticipation of your
 
own personal plea to him to take over the important job as editor of
 
The Sourdough Crock.
 
There are quite a number of things to talk over in connection
 
with The Sourdough Crock. If it keeps relatively the same format and
 
size as this excellent Newsletter did under Hector Lee's editorship,
 
then something must be done about the f
inances.
 
Sam will certainly be up to the editorial end of things, and as
 
a highly gifted artist and illustrator can give us an interesting illus-
trated house organ.  He cannot do this without adequate f
inancial support;
 
so with the Constitution out of the way, we might devote a major part of
 
r
 
Professor Bess Lomax Hawes - 2

971
 
next year's meetings to The Sourdough Crock. Meanwhile, Sam may be
 
able to l
ay hands on loose funds where he is.  Hector Lee did a certain
 
amount of it, but ended up subsidizing it out of his own pocket, and
 
occasionally making appeals for money.  I am opposed to this, feeling
 
that the Newsletter should be on a firm basis.
 
There might be a possibility of reclaiming 10 cents on the dollar,
 
or 25 cents--10 cents per subscription, 25 cents per subscription, or
 
whatever, to cover these costs.  Sam could get some l
ine on costs by
 
writing Hector Lee.
 
In years past, all membership fees went to the University of
 
California Press to help cut down the annual deficits which were covered
 
by the University of California.  We always raised enough money by regis-
tration fees, and occasionally donations, to put on the annual meetings.
 
I trust that all goes well with you, and I shall be pleased to
 
help you in any way that I can.  The telephone number here is 825-4242.
 
This is a Centrex number, and is not intercepted at the UCLA switchboard.

Dear Wayland:
 
Concerning your suggestion to appoint a student to the Program Committee
 
for next year's meeting, though I have no objections in theory, I can
 
see some practical problems.  The dimensions of both time and space with
 
which we have to deal make the simple assembling of a committee a problem
 
under the most favorable conditions; I would hate to see it get any more
 
complicated than it already is.  For another thing, where would the stu-
dent come from -- the home campus of the Program Chairman, or should the p
 
position be rotated among the various campuses?  Maybe I
'm anticipating
 
trouble needlessly but I can see the possibility of unpleasantnesses develepin
 
oping over whose student was selected -- not to say which one.
 
I certainly am not opposed to student participation; indeed, I
've urged
 
more in the past but couldn't this be handled informally?  Couldn't we,
 
for example, recommend the inclusion of students to the specific Program
 
Committee involved and leave it up to them to utilize the suggestion a
 
according to the availability of student talent and energy and the prac-
tical possibilities in their area?
 
Finally, though I sympathize whole-heartedly with students'  desires to be
 
"in" I am not sure that a single representative on a committee would make
 
any real difference except to the feelings of the particular student
 
selected.  What I would like to see is a more significant student contri-
bution.  Why not turn over one whole afternoon session to the students --
or appoint a student committee to handle the banquet entertainment and
 
speakers or something of the kind?  Though this suggestion may seem to
 
contradict my first remarks, and would undoubtedly be an organizational
 
pain-in-the-neck, I think we should try to avoid tokenism; nobody learns
 
much from that kind of a relationship.
 
Cordially,
 
Bess Lomax Hawes

Memorandum from:  Wayland D. Hand
 
To:  The Executive Vice--President and
 
Regional Vice-Presidents of the
 
California Folklore Society
 
At a UCLA student and faculty evaluation meeting of
 
the CFS 17th Annual Meeting held at San Fernando Valley
 
State College April 18-19, considerable sentiment was
 
evidenced for student participation in the planning of
 
next year's program.  Accordingly, I proposed  that it
 
might be a good i
dea t
o include a student on the Program
 
Committee.
 
Since this has not been done hitherto, I  should
 
like your concurrence in the proposal.
 If we expanded
 
the committee to five people, there could be one student
 
representative on the Committee  from the North as well
 
as one from the South.
 
May I have the pleasure of an early reply, please,
 
so that we can proceed immediately to the naming of the
 
Program Committee?  Early publicity in Western Folklore 
will assure us broad participation for the Santa Clara
 
Meeting.
 
Thanks,

Ed Cray's letter certainly seems most interesting.  A good many of
 
his suggestions seem to lie more in the editor's province than mine,
 
s
o I will not comment on them beyond saying that--if they are adopted--
Cray might be a good nominee for the person to execute them.  The one
 
thing that rather disturbed me about the CFS meeting was that--though
 
all sorts of good ideas were formally approved--no s
ingle person was
 
made responsible for their execution.  The one exception that I can
 
recall to this is the naming of Sam Hinton as the person who s
hould
 
try to get support from the various UC campuses.  I haven't heard from
 
him, but assume he has accepted this responsibility and is following
 
through or
. it.  Meanwhile, the other notions are no one particular
 
person's responsibility nor is anything much being done about them as
 
far as I know.  Of course, I am not up to date on the informal activities
 
of Society members, and I may be entirely wrong about this.  Unless I
 
am, though, it seems to me that the crying need is to put the problem
 
of executing  the - Society's policy as outlined at the spring meeting
 
into the hands of one individual who will follow through effectively.
 
The idea of publishing a book is an interesting one.  I am given pause
 
by the frequent complaints of the WF editors about the quality of material
 
which has to be accepted.  Assuming this problem can be overcome, though,
 
the idea seems excellent to me.  Unfortunately, the Press does not publish
 
festschrifts or collections of this sort.  I would think, though, that
 
a commercial publisher might well be interested.

Dear Hector:
 
News of the society's financial plight is distressing, but,
 
at the same time, CFS'  reaction is exciting.
 
I would like to recommend that the next annual meeting be
 
framed with the following considerations in mind:
 
1
) The meeting be held at UCLA, where a large urban center
 
can provide an audience.
 
2) That the meeting be publicized.
 The university can do this,
 
and I can help.
 
3
) Special registration fees for students be widely publicized.
 
Perhaps too the same rate could apply to the general public
 
which will not be much interested in a banquet.
 
4
) The banquet address should be a "keynote" speech, a major
 
address to which some press men (whom I know) might be invited.
 
It should be deliberately controversial, and not merely con-
fined to the niceties of our discipline.
 
5
) Papers should be widely solicited, upon the promise that
 
they will be published (more of that in a moment).
 I would
 
much like to see the Black Behavioral Scientists invited to
 
participate.  This is a militant group of social science
 
radicals bored with the present state of (largely) psychological
 
studies.
 (The contact is Charles W. Thomas, Ph.D., Director,
 
Education and Management Training Program, USC.)
 I would
 
hope that we could enlist Roger Abrahams, who is probably doing
 
the most interesting work in this field.  (His yet unpublished
 
paper on folklore and the urban riots is like to be a classic;
 
he may be all wrong, but his essay into "
applied folklore' is
 
pioneering.)
 
6) The sessions should not be compartmentalized into folk song,
 
tale, popular belief, but into the theme, or use of the material.
 
This division would depend upon the papers offered to the
 
program chairman, who above all else must be imaginative. 
7) I suggest also that the proceedings, or part of them, be
 
published in WF, with everything In that number reflecting
 
urban Negro l o
re, notes, reviews, etc.
 If program and planning
 
2- 2-2-2-2
 
are adequate, the number will become bibliography, history,
 
and resource for years to come.
 
8
) But above that, I urge that all the papers be edited into
 
a book and offered to an appropriate publisher.  The most
 
recent example I can think of-in folklore was JAF's number
 
on Indian lore and culture.
 But a better example,  since
 
that was published in hardcovers by Indiana -- a captive
 
house,  so to speak -- was the publication by Chandler
 
Publishing Company of San Francisco of the University of
 
California Law Review's number on The Law of the Poor.
 
That one number has become for hundreds, perhaps thousands
 
of attorneys the single major source book.
 For the time
 
being,  it is definitive, thanks to the late Jacobus ten
 
Broek who knew more about the subject than anyone else,
 
and a bright young editor Michael Tigar.  (Significantly,
 
Tigar was only a law student at .the time he edited the
 
number.
 He has since gone on to work for Edward Bennett
 
Williams.)
 
9) Other commercial firms might be interested, for, after
 
all, the subject is "hot," and will remain so for some
 
time.
 Our problem is only that we who should be leading
 
are so late.
 We should explore this in some detail, with
 
Bernard Norris, and with New York publishers like Prentice-
Hall.(actually in New Jersey).
 
10) The book, as distinguished from the journal,  should have
 
an introduction which I would hope would be 1
) a survey of
 
Negro folklore research in the United States (New World?);
 
and something of a prognosis for the future.  We have all
 
kinds of good men to write this: Wilgus, Crowley, Abrahams,
 
even Dorson, though I confess I am not one of his fondest
 
admirers.
 
11) The book too should also have a comprehensive bibliography
 
of Negro folklore studies.  This would be an excellent project
 
for either Hand's or Wilgus'  1
99 or 299 classes.
 In and of
 
itself,  it would be valuable.
 
12) I will offer to edit the book, with the understanding that
 
all royalties go to the society.
 (If at the moment the offer
 
seems presumptuous,  it may look less gratuitous when my
 
anthology of American bawdy songs is published this Fall.
 in
 
the meantime, I will rest upon the one hardcover and eight
 
paperback books I have written in fields other than folklore;
 
my daily editing of publications for the ACLU of Southern
 
California, and sundry other assignments and credits.)
 
I have any number of other ideas -- papers should be submitted
 
in advance so that the book and journal can be under way even
 
when the meetings are held, etc.,-- but these can wait some
 
"
acceptance" of the basic scheme.
 
As usual, the  '
Crock is a welcome diversion from the third
 
class mail which clutters my mailbox.  You are to'be warned
 
though; macaronis puns offend the speakers of both languages.

Let re first apologize f
or the lon6 delay in answering your
 
l
etter of August 28th on "
Stems f
or t
he Good of the Order".  I
 have only
 
just returned from t
he University of Colorado where I s
pent t
he s
ummer
 
taking a course d
esigned to brush up anthropolo,7 t
eachers; s
ince it was
 
under the direction of J
ohn Greenway, I do indeed feel properly s
timulated,
 
not to s
ay prickled.  In a
ny case, :
I
 have f
allen badly behind in r
ry corres-
pondence.
 
On your points.
,
 
1
)  I S
hould cert dnly support the Idea o
f tae S
ociety's
 
attempting t
o d
evelop a research project.  I have no ideas at all as t
o
 
f
)nding,
, but I shall
,, I hope,, be investigating possibilities d
 ring this
 
next year as I just happen to have a little project of r
rV own for which
 
I
 am hoping to locate s
ome s
upport.  As I look into this question of
 
where has all the money gone,, I
'll s
end along a
rq information t
hat might
 
be of gen e
ral use.
 
2)  Personally, I c
annot conceive of the Societys s f
 .
nctiorning
 
properly w
ithout your aegis.  I suppose it isn't proper to beg, but cant
 
you consider keeping t
he job a few years more?  I real.i.ze p of c
ourse,, that
 
you have done more than your share.
 
3
)  I feel the s
ame way about the C
rock, to which I
 have in-
tended to hake a donation for s
ome t
ime
s.  Now that rV menory has b
een duly
 
jogged, h
erewith is a s
r
 all
1
.  c
ontribution.  Would it possibly work out for
 
you to continue the editint7
,
, but t
o pass t
ie chore (
and expense) of actually
 
putting the paper out to someone else?  For instaneep if the federal poverty
 
funds ever get un-frozen (
thawed?) here  I w
r
ill have a very well qualified
 
graduate student working for me; he coi n perfectly well do the necessary
 
d
irty work, I 4
iould think.  :
l
-
'
ow much mone-y is actually i
rmrolved?  I do
 
think we need the Crock; it s
erves a s
pecial function which the J
ournal cannot
 
possibly fulfill..
 
T
he a
�
rove are s
ir
:p%r off-the-cuff reactions; I
 s
 l
l write gain when
 
I gave had a bit more t
ime to think.  Or perhaps we can get together at s
ome
 
point.  I
dill you be in the L
.A. area wV t
ime this fall?  I do not at the moment
 
have definite plans to c
omae north# though I s
hall probably g
et up to Berkeley
 
before the 4
ew Year and cold ea:d
.ly drive a bit further.
 
Cordially!

LUX MENTIS-LUX ORBIS
 
OFFICE OF THE DEAN OF THE COLLEGE
 
Dear Bess,
 
September 28, 1
967
 
}hanks for the good letter.  I guess I could hold on to
 
the Executive Vice Presidency of CSS another year or so if that
 
is "the will of the people," but I do feel that some of these
 
j
obs should go to young people whose careers will be advanced
 
by such opportunities.
 
The spring meeting will be in Berkeley on April 12-13.
 
Bill Bascom will be program chairman.
 
Oh, yes--another part of your letter says, "
...herewith is
 
a small contribution," which you forgot to enclose.  I mention
 
it only because I don't want you to think I am remiss in thanks.
 
It is your good thought and intention that I appreciate, anyway;
 
so don't let this lie on your conscience...and I won't, either.
 
A summer with John Greenway must indeed have been stimulating.
 
I wish we could get him to settle down somewhere here in California.
 
He is, as you indicate, a prickly-pear; but a little of him now
 
and then is relished by the best of men.
 
Yours,
 
Hector Lee

dear Res:
 
ELY, NEVADA
 
I am sending you what I could find--a not very good cony of the fig-st,
 
uncorrected edition of -
)
ur Introducing Folklore. We rushed this out
 
last year so that I could get it into the hands of my students.  Then
 
we worked out a better, corrected edition so that Stith Thompson could
 
try it out this semester.  dis class grew so large that he used up all
 
the "
extra" copies we had.
 
You will see that we have kept to a brief introduction, knowing that
 
it woulC have to be supplemented according to local preference and
 
practice.  Since the publishers are stalling, we fe
-r that it will not
 
be ready for fall classes, and are now considering financing our own
 
printed edition--a sma ll, experi,nental one--to that some interested
 
neonle can use it in September.
 T
iltimr
:tely we wish to see a parerback
 
at a modest price, somewhere between one and two dollars.
 
We are much concerned about the decline of the California Folklore Society.
 
It was not doing well before the cancellation of the meeting last year,
 
and this year we had only the program participants, their guests, the
 
local arrangements people, and a couple of officers in attendance.  What
 
can be wrong?  Fury and I have considered sendinu out a questionnaire to
 
other regional societies to see how they operate.  We have wondered if
 
the society should fo'low the example of the journal and become WPstern
 
Folklore Society--with regional officers =n the several western states.
 
�
%
!e h
ave wondered too if o
ur business has been conducted too informally.
 
Coul� it be that
, we need a brisk, businesslike nomination of o"f
 icers,
 
treasurer's report, etc., to give members a real fee
 ling of participation?
 
Could it be that some good people who have participated in the g
r
ist and
 
who no longer come have been d
issatisfied because they didn't feel that
 
their membership g
ave them real participation opportunities?  Ue wish you
 
would c
=ive this problem some thought.  The society can be salfaaged, I am
 
s
ure.  h
ue should have had people from Rerkeley, Cacramento State, Chico
 
State, San Francisco State, Stanford, etc.  Have had all these represented
 
in the past.  Also, should have had at lea&t fifty folklore students from
 
San Jose sitting in.  And we could, if we could find the right corrective
 
measure,  and go to work on it.  Another thoul;ht: we could merge meetings
 
with the Sout'iwest Antro Society--or even P
acific branch of Philological.
 
t
i
ne enjoyed meeting you, wish we could have had more t
ime to visit.  Perhaps
 
we will see you at Sonoma in August if you get up that way.

Minutes - Executive Board Meeting
 
April 25, 1974
 
The meeting of the Executive Board of the California Folklore
 
Society was held on April 25, 1974 at the Holiday Inn, Santa
 
Rosa, California.
 The meeting was called to order by the President
 
Hector H
. Lee at 7
:30 P.M.
 Officers present:. Eleanor Long,
 
Marjorie McLain, Barbara LaPan Rahm, Madeleine Hall, Joan Perkal.
 
President's Renort: 
Hector Lee reported that the Society's
 
Sneaker's Bureau has been most successful.  A new program will
 
be instituted in the fall.  We will try and implement the list
 
of organizations that might wish speakers by lists of museums,
 
women's clubs, and historical societies.
 
Internshin Program: Dr. Lee reported that the Internship Proposal
 
was submitted to the National Endowment for the Humanities.  They
 
reviewed the orogram and made suggestions for certain revisions.
 
These revisions will be made in accordance with
i their suggestions
 
and if this grant proposal (
$30,000)  is accepted it will commence
 
in the fall.  There will be 5 students working on
: a quarter
 
system and 3 students working on a semester system.  We must
 
(
if the program is accepted by NEH) publish a synopsis of the
 
nro,gram in C
IF.  We must invite the student interns to be on
:
 
a yearly program (pe f
tap-s American Folklore Society meeting)
 
to report on their participation
, in the internship, proposal as
 
well as publish
t written reports by those same students.
 
Editor's Report. Hector Lee has a detailed written report by
 
th,e editor, D.K. Wilgus.  A committee gill be asked to work with
 
D.K. in finding someone.to,take over editorship in 1975 when
 
his term a,.
f office expires.
.  This
; committee will try to meet
 
in six months, and then report back to the society solutions 6

regardN editorial policy and the selection
: of a new editor.
 
Crock Report. Barbara Rahm reported that t
'he subscription
 
return was not adequate to ,meet the financial needs of editing
 
"
the newsletter.  Cal State University, Northridge subsidized the
 
f
irst 3 issues.  The subscription monies were used to produce the
 
last issues.  Since the function of the Crock is to disseminate
 
information about CFS and to stimulate interest in the Society
 
i
t will be necessary to find some Way of realizing the $400 a
 
year necessary to finance i
t.  One suggestion made was to
 
get some department of a college or university to subsidize it
 
on a yearly rotating basis.
 Another suggestion was to ask if
 
the U
.C. Press would channel their monies from student subscriptions
 
towards the production of the Crock.  The board accented the
 
recommendation that Gregg�Longnecker of U
.C.L.A. become the
 
new editor of the Crock.
 
Secretary's report. Last year's meeting at Dominguiz Hills
 
came out even as to expenses, and the current balance in
 
our bank account at the Pico Branch of the Santa Monica Bank
 
is ?535.75.  The secretary r
'ecommended that each host institution
 
for the yearly meeting insist on a registration fee for both
 
professionalsand students.  The secretary also recommended that
 
the board of directors be expanded,  Since the UC Press has
 
always maintained the position of ex officio secretary/treasurer,
 
i
tz_'was' suggested ,
that inr.
.addition to a recording secretary, the
 
new position of Secretary to the Society be added.  This would
 
be a revision of the by-f
laws.  They must be revised to include
 
the new subcription rate changes.

Dear Bess,
 
As you will see from the enclosed, I hope
 
you will remain as chairman of the nominating
 
committee for CFS.
 If you can't attend the
 
meeting, one of the other members can present
 
your report.
 
I have not heard from Conte Hoffman about
 
-holding
; the 19?
5 conference at Marymount P

I
'll follow it up, though, and we can consider
 
it amon7 the other (

I
'd like to ask you three to serve as the nominating committee f
or
 
the California Folklore Society this year.  At our business meeting on
 
April 27 we must elect (
1) a regional vice premident to succeed Eleanor
 
Long, (
2) the Recording Secretary, (3) two student vice presidents.
 
The Recording Secretary j
ob should be easy to fill, just by re-electing
 
Joan Perk
-al.
 As I read the bylaws she can succeed herself, and no one has
 
succeeded better in that j
ob.  I hope you can persuade her to serve another
 
ter
"m.  The two student vice presidents serve for one year.
 
As for the regional vice president--who this year should come from
 
the north end of the st-ite--I think there are some very good possibilities.
 
To drop a f
ew names--only as suggestions, you understand:
 
Roland Dickison, Professor of English, Cal State U
, Sacramento.  He
 
has been active in the Society for a long time; teaches folklore; helped
 
plan the conference two years ago at American River College.
 
Herminia Menez, Assoc. Prof. of Ethnic Studies, Cal. State, Sonoma.
 
She took her Ph.D. under Kenny Goldstein at U of Pa; teaches folklore here;
 
is active in American Folklore Society; is chairman of this year's local
 
arrangements committee for our April conference.
 
Alan Dundes, if you could persuade him to serve, would be excellent.
 
Dan Crowley, ditto.
 
I am asking Bess Hawes to serve as Chairman (Don't make me say chair-
person).  Bess can coordinate your deliberations; then if she can't be
 
present at the meeting Sam or Tom can officiate at the election.  Okay?
 
Facing this election problem, I am reminded that perhaps one of my
 
presidential functions should be to try to gather into our fold a few
 
strays who once were active but have drifted, and some new people who
 
may need encouragement.  I am thinking of such ilk as Lew Girdler (
now
 
retired), A
i
irelio Espinosa (
Stanford), Ruth Carlson (Hayward), Jim Tidwell
 
(
San Diego), Lyn Carranco (
Arcata), Esther Shepard (
San Jose), et al.
 
Let me know of your willingness to serve on this committee, and I
'll
 
f
orget the matter, knowing that it is in good hands.
 
Yours,

Co-)ies to

LUX MENTIS-LUX ORBIS
 
Your letter of April 9 is welcome.
 In your absence I
'll ask
 
Sam Hinton to act as chairman of the committee.  Sam will be present
 
for at least part of the conference, he and Tom can work up their
 
slate of officers, and if Sam cannot attend the business meeting Tom
 
can with full authority present the names.  They can take up where you
 
left off in your letter.
 
I think Joan Perha1's suggestion is fine, that she be apT)ointed
 
Treasurer and that a new person be named Recording Secretary, but
 
there are two problems to solve first.
 (A) We would have to change
 
the Constitution, and this would require advance notice to the whole
 
membership; and (B) we have always had the University Press serve as
 
treasurer because the membership money goes directly to the Press.
 In
 
the past we have had some influence on the Press through this arrange-
ment, and although that office seems to be without a name at the moment
 
I
'd be reluctant to change it without consulting our Editor and the Press.
 
Let's say we'll ask Joan to continue in office until we can work out the
 
change.
 
As for Vice President, I agree with you; it is time we gave Roland
 
Dickison that recognition if he wants it.
 He has served well for many
 
years.
 I would not worry about having two from the Sacramento area.
 
But also as you say, Alan Dundes would also be a good one if he would
 
do it.
 In the past he has declined, but he might be ready now.  Let's
 
leave it to Sam and Tom to consider your letter and then choose between
 
tem.
 
I never did know how the student `
T
. P.'s were selected.  Sam and
 
Tom have your letter and they can do as they think best.  This question
 
should be raised in our Board meeting for clarification.
 
Have a good time in your travels.  And hurry back to us.
 
Yours,
 
Lee

!
ear Hector:
 
Your letter notifying me that I am too supposed to be nominations chairman
 
for CFS this year arrived the morning before I was scheduled to l
eave for
 
Vancouver, Boston, .
,ew York, l
F
inland, t
t
ussia and Washington in order of
 
appearance with a tentative return date of July 1
5th.
 Under the c
ircum-
-
tances (
though I did try to get you by phone with no luck) I did the only
 
thing I could think of a
t the moment as being a practical contribution: I
 
phoned Joan Perkal to see if she would be willing to serve a
s secretary again.
 
Joan said she would but doesn't much want to on the grounds that she feels the
 
executive committee should not be choked with l
ong-term members who won't
 
l
eave, thus denying access t
o planning by new members.  .
ier counter suggestion
 
seems to me an excellent one: that she be appointed treasurer to substitute
 
for the currently ever-absent press representative and that we nominate some-
one e
lse for the recording secretary's position.  That would give us two advan-
c
abes:  .
oan's presence for continuity and X
's contribution of new ideas.  i
f this
 
could be done without requiring a constitutional revision, .
ioan and I both
 
approve the notion highly and would l
ike to suggest Elliot Oring for the
 
recording secretary's position;  l
e i
s bright, young, obviously interested in
 
working with and for CFS and apparently a settled member of the California
 
academic s
cene.  '
.
esides we both think i
t's t
ime we had a male secretary -
-
we mustn't a
llow CFS to get behind the times.
 
As f
or the vice-president, Roland Dickison would be fine except that we would
 
have both our northern v
...s from the same area (
Sacramento); perhaps that i
s
 
not, .
.
owever, -
.
00 great a draw-sack.  As you may or may not know, 1  think l
ie
 
f
elt badly that Marjorie was nominated two years ago instead of himself, and
 
I thought myself after i
t was a
ll over that he had a point -
- certainly he has
 
been a l
ong-time hard-working member.  Second to him I think I
'.. put Alan
 
Dundes if he'd do it.  I hear (
though I don't know for sure) that Dan Crowley
 
plans another year in Africa quite soon and Ming Minez i
s a wonderful person
 
but anotlier fairly new L
iember.
 
And f
inally, a
s far as the s
tudent v
. r .
s go, 1  would recommend asking the
 
current office-holders to recommend their successors (
unless anyone has any
 
better ideas) -
- at l
east, I think that's what we did last year.
 
From here (
I'::i visiting my daughter Naomi who i
s teaching at the University
 
of Massachusetts in Boston) I will be l
eaving in a day or two for New York
 
where I will be workinb with Alan for the next couple of months.  I
t seems
 
very unlikely, therefore, that I can get back to California for the meeting
 
and also a bit awkward f
or further chairing of the nominations committee.
 
I am sending a copy of this l
etter to Sam and also to Mr. Johnson.  If you
 
want t
o fire me, or discuss any further points or s
imply get my f
irm vote,
 
can be reached

A SUCCESSFUL CONFERENCE. The 1974 CFS conference in Santa Rosa was well
 
attended.  The program was pronounced excellent, and everyone seemed to go
 
away happy.  Because of unexpected (
:
and t
herefore; unbu
.dgeted
.) costs, we lost
 
a little money, but it was worth it.  Registration: 5
3 students; 5
9 members
 
and visitors.  Banquet attendance: 9
4 dinners served.
 
b  NEW CROCK EDITOR-  Barbara
 Rahm
 has  done
 a fine
 job in reviving the Sourdough 
Crock and keeping it alive, but now she turns to other things.  On her recom-
mendation the CFS Board appointed Gregory Lon-enec'cer of Reseda to take over
 
the editorship.  As we all know, the Crock is in financial trouble, and G
. L
.
 
is working on plans for raising funds to support it.  More on that later.

of his term next ,
year.  The committee appointed to (a) work out understandings
 
with the U. C

ournal's policies and recommend policy
 
positions, and (
e) search out and nominate a new editor: Wayland D

THINGS TO D0. Some jobs are piling up.  If you want to help, let me know.
 
1
. We have no record of any clearance by the Internal Revenue for
 
CFS as a tax-exempt non-profit educational organization.  We need this
 
to get donations.  Joan Perkal will investigate.
 
2. We must work out some revisions in our constitution, among which will
 
be the new job description for the Secretary.
 
3. We have promised to survey the Community Colleges to find out how many
 
offer courses in folklore and ,
:elated subjects.
 
4
. We must prepare f
or early fall issue another brochure offering the
 
services of our CFS Speakers Bureau.
 
5
. Although we won't know until August or September whether we are to
 
get our grant, we must prepare to "hit the ground running" i
n c
ase
 
it comes through.  This means {
getting arrangements made with the
 
graduate schools that have students to place in internships in
 
applied folklore, the graduate stuients themselves, and the field
 
work agencies such as community colleges that might take them on.
 
PERSONAL NOTE. In case anyone wants to get in touch with me between June 6
 
and July 20, I
'll be first in a Western Writers Conference and later in the
 
Summer Session at Utah State University, Logan, Utah.  I
'll get my t

The California Folklore Society is eager to compile information on the
 
extent to which folklore and folk-related disciplines are being offered in
 
the Community Colleges of our region.  This may be important to you as well
 
as to us because we are working on a plan to make grants-in-aid that could
 
provide curriculum enrichment for some of you.  It is also important to us
 
in advising graduate students who see possible careers in the teaching of
 
folklore, ethnic studies,

TO:
 Members of the American Association of Physical Anthropologists [
Paid up
 
as of 31 May 1974]
 
FROM:
 John Buettner-Janusch, vice-president and program chairman
 
This notice is the first formal call for papers for t
he 1975 annual meeting of
 
the association.
 The meeting will be held JO--12 April 1975 at the BROWN PALACE HOTEL,
 
DENVER, COLORADO.  A final reminder will be mailed early in September.  Notices for
 
reservations, descriptions of accommodations, the program, and other material will be
 
mailed in February.
 The program chairman must use t
he membership list of paid-up
 
members supplied by the office of the American Anthropological Association.  The list
 
is revised monthly.
 Thus, this notice should be received by all student and regular
 
members.
 
The final date after which abstracts will not be accepted is 1 November 1974.
 
The deadline is earlier this year.  The large number of papers at the Amherst meeting
 
in April 1974 may well be a sign that such a large number will be common in the future.
 
In order to run the meetings in a reasonable and orderly fashion, it will be necessary
 
to introduce stringent adherence to the very simple rules and regulations described
 
here -- beginning with the deadline.
 
Symposia must be proposed in outline form to the program chairman no later than
 
1
5 June [
a date probably antedating this notice].  All symposia must be ready in final
 
form, abstracts included AND IN THE OFFICE OF THE PROGRAM CHAIRMAN by 5 October 1974.
 
A form upon which the final version of the abstract is to be typed is submitted
 
at this time.
 PLEASE DO NOT LOSE IT.  Abstracts that are not submitted in absolutely
 
correct form on these special forms will be returned to the person submitting such or
 
will be rejected automatically i
f received close to the deadline.  Please practice
 
typing the abstract before placing it on the form.  Please follow the style of the
 
enclosed example EXACTLY.
 
Contributed papers will be limited t
o 1
2 minutes.
 S
imultaneous sessions are
 
inevitable, we shall try to keep them to a minimum number.  We shall try to schedule
 
symposia so that maximum attendance will be possible.
 Organizers of symposia may use
 
their discretion about the length of invited papers.  We recommend that 20 or 30
 
minutes is a reasonable time.
 So far the program chairman has received quite firm
 
outlines for symposia on nutrition, fossil  primates, primate population  biology, and
 
t
entative proposals for two more.  The program chairman continues t
o hope he can
 
organize a plenary symposium for the first evening on Archaeology and Physical
 
Anthropology, in the one-year-old tradition set by his predecessor.
 
The program chairman has selected a small committee to assist in screening
 
abstracts.  Abstracts will be rejected i
f they do not meet minimal standards of
 
intelligibility.
 One rule of thumb we shall use is to reject all abstracts that
 
(
2)
 
contain statements in the form that something "will be done" and the results "will
 
be discussed."  There are two reasons for rejecting such abstracts; first, such
 
wording puts insufferable burdens upon the editor of the AJPA who must revise each
 
such abstract for publication in the AJPA; second, an abstract that is organized
 
to culminate in such statements is about nothing. And there is no reason to believe
 
that a significant paper filling the gap presented in the abstract will be produced
 
between 1 November and 10 April.
 
The program and the annual meeting are growing in size, this lays a greater
 
and greater burden upon the editor of the AJPA, upon the local arrangements committee,
 
and upon the program chairman.  All the requirements we have imposed this year aim at
 
making the program manageable for the Association, pleasant for the members, and
 
reasonable for those who attend.
 
The program chairman believes it will be helpful for whose who intend to give
 
papers i
f a list of probable titles for sessions of contributed papers is enclosed.
 
Potential contributors are asked to suggest sessions into which they believe their
 
paper will fit.  This selection of titles for sessions i
s not final and will be revised
 
after 1 November 1974.
 
The enclosed set of recommendations is submitted to the membership with the
 
hope that this year the larger majority of contributors as well as the invited speakers
 
will present papers whose format is appropriate to a professional meeting.  Make your
 
slides so that they are legible and have a point, make your paper come to a climax a
 
moment or two before your time i
s up, do not force the session chairman to throw you
 
off the platform.  PRACTICE YOUR PAPER.
 
Remember:
 student papers should be clearly marked STUDENT, and not on the
 
special abstract form submitted here.
 Include the statement that it is a student paper
 
when the abstract is mailed.
 
DEADLINE:
 1 November  1974

THE CONTRIBUTED PAPER
 
A really good contributed paper is well thought-out, carefully planned,
 
adequately rehearsed and properly timed so that it does not run over.
 It is
 
constructed so as to (
1) define the problem and set the stage,  (2) to explain
 
what was done,  (3) to tell what was found and (
4) to consider the broader
 
implications.
 
A contributed paper differs from a paper submitted for publication in the
 
amount of detail, and in  bibliographic depth.
 Within the time constraints,
 
it is rarely possible to cite all previous work, and it becomes boring to
 
listen to an exact recitation of methods.
 
Many contributed papers, but not all, benefit from slides, provided that
 
they are graphic  (and not just reproductions of tables).
 It is well to group
 
slides, during presentation, to avoid the distraction of many dark-light
 
cycles, and to avoid 15 minutes  in the dark, which invites inattention and
 
slumber.
 
At an average rate of speaking, one page of manuscript equals 2 to 2 1/2
 
minutes of speaking time, more if words are grouped to avoid a monotone.
 A
 
slide takes a minute or so to project and to explain, more if content is to
 
be emphasized.
 
Handouts are substitutes for slides, and especially useful if tabular
 
material is important to the presentation.
 But handouts take time to hand out,
 
and organization.
 If handouts are planned, consider whether they are necessary
 
and relevant, whether they can be simplified and whether they will engender
 
sufficient interest to warrant their use.
 
The purpose of a contributed paper at a scientific meeting is to present
 
new findings.
 Re-analyses of published data, and re-interpretation of extant
 
data demand justification.
 If the evidence anticipates new information, and
 
is then presented with refried old data, it will feel cheated.
 
Since these are scientifc meetings catchy and cute titles are at least
 
inappropriate, and if they promise more than is produced, they can lead to
 
disappointment.
 Attempts to review a broad subject area, without new or
 
novel substantive findings can also be counter-productive.
 
The abstract, submitted well in advance, should be considered part of the
 
paper, and in most scientific societies it constitutes an actual publication.
 
Abstracts, therefore, should give information in sufficient detail to stand
 
by themselves.
 If the preliminary data supplied in the abstract prove to be
 
incorrect or inadequate, the abstract should be withdrawn.
 
Papers given at scientific meetings, especially those with parallel sessions,
 
are an integral part of scientific communication.
 They must have something
 
important to reveal, not just an opportunity to be heard.
 To be worth audience
 
time they should be planned and polished, so that they benefit the speaker and the
 
listeners, alike.
 
SLIDES FOR THE SCIENTIFIC MEETING
 
Nearly all slides used at scientific meetings are of the 2 by 2 outer
 
size (
50mm x 50mm).
 Exceptions should be indicated to the Program Chairman,
 
in advance of the meeting.
 
The useful area of a 2x2 slide is 24x36mn, i
.e., two by three proportions.
 
Charts and graphs should be drawn with these proportions in mind.
 
Though slides can be projected either as vertical (
the 36mm dimension
 
vertical) or horizontal, most projection setups are designed to fill the screen
 
in the horizontal format.
 
While long tables can be reduced to the 35mm (
24x36mm) size, not much more
 
than ten lines can be read from the rear of an auditorium.
 Either use condensed
 
tables or use handouts if long tables are necessary.
 
Good slides can be home-made, using contrast process film (for white on
 
black, i
.e., negative slides), or direct-positive reversal film or kodachrome
 
or Ektachrome for positive slides. 
Usually, professional help will yield
 
superior slides, with far better alignment.
 
All slides should be mounted, preferably glass-mounted for protection,
 
index dotted on the lower left side and numbered. 
Do not mix cardboard mounts
 
and glass mounts.
 Avoid thick tape-and-glass mounts that may jam in some stack-
loaders and trays.
 
If Kodachrome views of archaeological sites or fossils or people are
 
included, check them out for sharpness and exposure.
 A slide that looks good
 
on a small viewer may be too dense to project before an audience of 350•
 
Alternatives to slides are (
1) handouts and (
2) blackboard drawings.
 
Handouts are more appropriate for long tables, provided that the long tables are
 
themselves useful and meaningful.
 Blackboard drawings, much used in teaching,
 
usually appear shoddy when used with contributed papers.
 They carry a last-
minute feeling.

FROM:
 Editor,  From The Sourdough Crock 
Grogor
__y J. Longenecker
 
I was very honored to have been appointed as the new editor of the
 
Sourdough Crock at the April meeting of the California Folklore
 
Society.
 Having become editor I would like to take this opportunity
 
to thank the members of the Society for the privilege and, especially,
 
Barbara Rahm.
 
I have two reasons for thanking Barbara.
 First,  she gave me the
 
chance to work with her on the Crock in the past year.
 Secondly,
 
because of her,  the newsletter was reactivated for the benefit of
 
the society.
 
When Barbara took over the editorship of the Sourdough Croak two
 
years ago it was because a feeling existed among Society members
 
that a newsletter was neede d
.
 Through countless problems, n
 arbara
 
put the Crock back into working order.  One problem with which she
 
began,  and which still exists today, was that of financing.
 
California State University, Northridge offered to underwrite the
 
costs of the newsletter with the understanding that eventually it
 
would become a self-paying operation.  When the funds from the
 
university ran out and a subscription basis used, it was discovered
 
that funds collected from subscribers amounted to only enough to
 
cover the cost of one edition of the Crock.
 
All of this was to have been brought before the Society during last
 
April's meeting but due to time pressures Barbara was not able to
 
bring attention to this matter.
 She had prepared a report setting
 
forth the Crock's financial state and outlining three possible
 
solutions for the problem of funds.
 Barbara and I have coni:erred
 
on the alternative funding solutions and thought of a fourth pos -
sibilty.
 These four alternatives are given below for the consider-
ation of members of the society.
 it is hoped that one of those four
 
will be satisfactory to tho members and that, by replies trlrough
 
mail or by phone,  i
t can be ascertained wi-t
ether or not funds can
 
be located with which to finance the newsletter.  If this is not
 
the case, it must be assumed that sufficient interest doesn't exist
 
to maintain a newsletter for
. th  society.
 
SOURDOUGH CROCK FUNDING POSSIBILITIES
 
1.
 Subscriptions to the Crock
. (as mentioned above,  this possibility
 
was tried before and proved inadequate for yearly funding).
 
2.
 The use of studenl
.  subscriptions from the journal, Western Folk-
lore. 
This solution is based on the tec hnicality that the e« for
 
-
a-
of the Sourdough Crock is on the editorial staff of the Western Folk-
lore journal.
 
3.
 "Host"  or "Patron"  institutions that rotate the cost of under-
writing the newsletter on a yearly basis.
 This is essentially what
 
CSUN did for some time.
 In becoming a "Patron" of the Crock the
 
institution would gain the privilege of supporting an academic
 
society's newsletter and the newsletter would bear the seal of the
 
institution (the cost to a "Host" would amount to $400 per year).
 
4.
 Seeking grants from various agencies.
 Such government agencies
 
as HEW or organizations such as NEA- might be solicited for grants.
 
These four funding alternatives represent the ideas of Barbara Rahm
 
and I.
 If anyone else can think of any other possibilities I would
 
appreciate hearing of them.
 It is imperative that I receive some
 
feedback that results in funding for the Sourdough Crock in time
 
for another edition.
 If I gain no such response,  then I must assume
 
that the interes t which caused
 Farba
z ra  to  reacti vate  the ne ws letter
 
has declined and that the Crock must be discontinued.
 
It is my personal desire that funding from some source may be
 
secured and the Sourdough Crock continued as th e n
 easletter of
 
the California Folklore Soci ety.
 The soliciation of funds is not
 
a pleasant matter but it is one that must be taken care of in one
 
fast-
don or
. another.
 Again,  I hope for favorable responses.
