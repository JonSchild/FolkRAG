"Dear Mr. President", Bloomington, Indiana, January 8, 1942
AFS 6401A
Mrs. Norman Miller: I am Mrs. Norman Miller of Bloomington, Indiana. I'm Mrs. Norman Miller, a
housewife in Bloomington, Indiana. I guess we hadn't been very aware of the emergency until the
last couple of weeks or so. But now with butter at forty-two cents and eggs at thirty-eight, we've sort
of begun to sit up and take notice. With Norman's paycheck not increasing any and the men at the
stone quarries getting laid-off every day or so, it's not so good. Oh, I suppose the men who get laid
off at the quarries can go out to Burn City or go out to Charleston and work for the government. But
with the government taking the tires and no way of getting there in your car, why I don't know what
we're going to do now.
I guess we housewives can do our share though by sort of watching in the kitchen and saving all the
scraps and using them as much as we can. Getting as much as we can out of everything we buy. If
we just don't try to stock up on all food supplies, why I suppose we won't be forcing prices up. And
that'd be good because then everybody will have a chance to get what they want in the stores and
when they want it.
I think it's a good idea to limit the tires and the sugar and all the stuff like that because then we all
sort of feel like we're helping with the war. I know I want to do my part and I know that all my friends
here in Bloomington want to do their parts too
