21E-B1 P & W F. THE SOLDIER'S SWEETHEART
This is Pat and [Boney?] Ford going to sing THE SOLDIER'S SWEETHEART.
'Twas a pretty fair maid sat in the garden, When a brave young soldier came ridin' by, Said, "My
pretty fair maid, why don't you marry me? Or don't you fancy such a man as I?" "You're not the man,
the man[,?] I wanted, You're not the man I've taken you to be, 'Cause you [ force fo'rce ?] yourself
on a fair young maiden Whose face before you never did see. "I have a true lover in the army, And
he has h's been thar for seven long years, And if he stays there seven sev'n years longer, No man
on earth is gonna marry me." "Now, maybe your true lover, he's been drownded, And maybe he's
on some battle field slain, Or maybe he's taken some fair girl to marry, And'll never come back
to you again." "Now, if my true lover, he's been drownded, Or if he's on some battlefield slain, Or
if he's taken some fair girl to marry, I'll love that girl that married him." 2 Page 2. THE SOLDIER'S
SWEETHEART He Reached ? his hand down in his pocket, That hand that was so white ? and small[.?]
And three gold rings that he wore on her fingers ? Down at her feet he let them fall. She picked
them up on her three fingers, And kisses gave them, one, two, three, Saying, "This here is my darling
soldier Who has returned for to marry me."
