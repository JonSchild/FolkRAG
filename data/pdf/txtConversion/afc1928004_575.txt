MR REILLY OF WHOM I'VE HEARD TELL, 
BY JAMES RICHMOND. 
SUNG BY PAT ROONEY. 
Copyright. 1881, by Mis. Pauline Lleder. 
Och! my name it's Jeremiah Reilly Esquire. 
I 
control a 
political ring; 
I 
own forty-rive big tenement houses, 
And I 
have seven sons in Sing Sing. 
I 
nominated myself into Congress, 
In the Senate I 
passed all the bills, 
I 
blackened three or four Senators eyes, 
For telling me to take a 
dose of pills. 
Spoken—Yes, I 
was arguing on the question which 
was the wealthiest, the United States or Grant, when 
Senator McGuire from Hoboken interrupted me, and 
I 
jumped all the grand stand and broke his neck-tie; 
General Sherman, Don Cameron and Roscoe Sprague 
I 
mean —Conkling shook hands with me, and one says 
to the other— 
CHORUS. 
Is this Mr. Reilly of whom I've heard tell, 
Is this Mr. Reilly, the elegant swell; 
If this is the Reilly that's spoke of so highly, 
And a 
pon my soul Reilly, you're getting on well. 
I 
was President of a 
bank till it busted, 
The cash assets was three paper collars; 
I 
stole thirteen truck loads of pennies, 
And twenty one barrells of trade dollars. 
I 
had the book-keeper and cashier sent to prison. 
While I 
had to make my escape; 
And while drinking champagne water in Canada, 
The Princess Louise got struck on my shape. 
Spoken —Yes, she says, had I 
known such a 
beauti-
ful man lived, I 
would never have married till I 
was 
sixteen. 
Just then the Sheriff came in with a,warrsnt 
for my arrest, he says— 
CHORUS. 
Is this Mr. Reilly of whom I've heard tell, 
Well now Mr. Reilly, you'll go to a 
cell, 
Are you Mr. Reilly, that's spoke of so highly, 
Well Mr. Reilly, in prison you'll dwell. 
I 
am going away, Norah darling, 
And leaving such an angel far behind; 
It will break my heart in two, which I 
fondly 
gave to you, 
And no other one so loving kind and true. 
Cuonus. 
Then come to my arms, Norah darling, 
Bid your friends in dear Ireland good-bye; 
And its happy we will be in that dear land ot the free, 
Living happy with your Barney McCoy. 
I 
would go with you, Barney darling, 
But the reason why I 
told you oft before; 
It would break my poor mother's heart if 
from her I 
had to part, 
And go roaming with you, Barney McCoy. 
Then come to my arms, Sus. 
I 
am going far away, Norah darling, 
Just as sure as there's a 
God I 
adore; 
But remember what I 
say; that until the 
judgement day, 
You will never see your Barney McCoy. 
Then come to my arms. Sro. 
I 
would go•with you, Barney darling, 
If my mother and the rest of them were there, 
For I 
know we wo.dd be blest in that dear land 
of the Wet, 
Living happy with your Barney McCoy. 
Then come to. my arms, STc. 
I 
am going far away, Norah Darling, 
And the ship is now anchored in the bay. 
And before to-morrow you will hear the signal gun, 
So be ready, it will carry us away. 
Then, come to

I am thinking of the day when but a 
little child, 
'I wandered o'er the meadows to the bill, 
Where the sweet flowers grew, and forever 
growing wild, 
And the stream e'er flowed by the mill. 
But the old mill house has gone to decay, 
I 
loved it and so did darling Kate, 
And the miller he lies sleeping where the 
gentle breezes blow 
And we played 'neatla the turnpike gate. 
CHORUS. 
For the turnpike gate is the pride of my heart, 
I 
loved it and so did darling Kate, 
When she sits beside me now, there's a 
smile 
upon her brow, 
That reminds me of the turnpike gate. 
And the old school house has gone to decay, 
Where the schoolmaster beard us recite, 
And those happy, happy days have faded 
from our view, 
When our little hearts were filled with delight 
And when school was out we would wander to 
the spring 
Where I 
drew for you pictures on your slate; 
And those happy childhood days they'll come 
again no more. 
When we played on the turnpike gate.

tis myself that knows it, for it's many's the day, 
Your husband wasn't the only man sat behind the wall, 
There's my old man licGuiness didn't get no job at all. 
The politicians promised him work on the Boulevard, 
To handle a 
pick and shovel and throw dirt on the cart. 
Alt! k.ix months ago they promised him work he'd shortly get 
But believe me, my good woman, they are promising hint yet. 
CHORUS 
Then cheer up, Mrs. Reily and d, n't give way to the blues, 
You and I 
will cut a 
shine, with new bonnets and new shoes; 
As for me I'm done crying, no more will 1
. sigh or sob, 
I'll wait till times get better, when McGuinness gets a 
job. 
The Italians, divil take them, why didn't they stay at home, 
Shure we had plenty of our own class to ate up all our own; 
They come out like bees in summer time and sworn tor to stay; 
The contractors they have hundreds for forty coils a 
day, 
They work upon the railroad they shovel snow and slush, 
But there's one thing in their favor, Italians they 
never do get lush, 
No, they always bring tin ir money home, taste no gin or winr 
And that one thing I'd like to say of your old man and mine 
Chorus. 
! 
the spring time now is coming we'll all have plenty woit, 
ileGuiness will go back to Ilia trade, shure lie's-a 
handsome clerk. 
You soonld see him climbtlie ladder as nimble as a 
fox, 
Faith he's the boy can handle the ould three cornered box. 
The boss is always bawling, Ili! there, don't you stop, 
Keep your eyes turned upward, don't let no mortar drop, 
Ah ! the old man he is always careful, nothing he lets fall, 
The diva a 
word you'd hear him say to my old man at all.

BE HOME EARLY TO-NIGHTI MY 
DEAR BOY, 
BUNG WITH GREAT SUCCESS BY MISS QUEEN HETITERTOM 
AND LEW BAKER. 
I 
have traveled through life, I 
have seen many things, 
That surprised me in every form; 
I 
have been at the plow, I 
have been at the spade, 
'Till dark, and at sunrise in the morn. 
But at night I 
would go for some pleasure thro' town, 
I 
was always for pleasure and joy; 
My mother would say when going away, 
Be home early, to-night, my dear boy. 
CHORUS. 
Be home early, to-night, my dear boy, 
Be home early, to-night, my dear boy; 
Dont spend all your money to gamble and drink, 
Be home early, to-night, my dear boy. 
One night I 
left home, and my poor mother was sick, 
In fever of torture and pain; 
She says, my dear boy, take the motto I 
give, 
I 
may not give it to you again. 
But when I 
returned from my night's fun and joy, 
I 
heard my poor mother was dead. 
'Twas then a 
cold chill through my body did run, 
When I 
thought of the last words she said. 
Cho. 
All young men that are here, take a 
word of advice, 
To your father and mother attend; 
For a 
good mother's love it must not be forgot, 
When she's gone you've lost your best friend, 
Don't spend all your money to gamble and drink, 
There are ninny things you can enjoy; 
Take the lesson I 
give'twas a 
mother's request, 
Keep good hours at night my dear boys.

Tho' for fighting and blood-shed I'm not much careing, 
I'll show no white feather if sent to the WU'S.

Then bring in the punch and replenish your glasses,

Long life to each boy in the Irish lluzzars. 
I 
remember the ranks when I 
was a 
wee fellow, 
My father, drum major, was just six feet high, 
My mother, God bless her, I 
often would tell her, 
When a 
man I 
would fight to win honor or die, 
Since then to the country I've seen a 
great service, 
I've smiled at all danger ne'er wincing at scars, 
When bullets were flying, where the fray was 
the thickest, 
The foremost of all were the Irish huzzars. 
Chorus. 
To the bugle's shrill notes I've obeyed like a 
soldier, 
When hungers sharp thorns in my bosom were deep; 
When darkness our forms has shielded from danger, 
The roar of the cannon has lulled me to sleep. 
At the clolie of the fight with the moon as our guardian, 
When peace was proclaimed 'neath the bright 
shining stars; 
Our commanders stern voices were heard loudly calling 
God bless you, my bold gallant Irish Iluzzars.

As happy as any young pair, 
Would join in the pleasure's and laugh at the flUll

Good-natured, contented they sit the long day,

'Memory gently leads me backward to the SHOTOS 
of long ago, 
Bright with many recollections dear to me; 
Happy faces smile upon me mid the breaking 
o'er the strand, 
Of the silvery surges made by memory's sea. 
Childhood's playmates cluster round me, friends 
of manhood's sterner years, 
Who have ceased the weary paths of life to roam; 
But amid the thronig of faces there is one ro 
treasure MOSt, 
Of a 
mother whom the angels beckoned home. 
CHORUS. 
'Tis the vision of my mother, she who rocked 
me when a 
babe, 
And who guarded me within my cradle nest; 
Earthly riches I 
would part with, just to hear 
her voice again, 
Of that mother whom the angels called to rest.

ANGELS IYCKONID MOTHER 
HOME TO REST, 
CONTUMED, 
She it was who softly murmured loving words 
above my head, 
As she held me ere she laid me down to sleep; 
And through weary hours of danger, every 
effort gladly made, 
For my comfort, while she oft would o'er me weep. 
Faintly I 
can still remember songs of melody she sang, 
Prayers she offered that I 
might be always blest, 
But at last she left her treasure to the Saviour's 
watchful care, 
For the angels beckoned her to come and rest. 
I 
have passed those youthful hours and have 
grown to manhood's age, 
Still my fancy often bids me backward stray. 
To the sunny days of childhood when the 
hours were sweetly spent, 
Wish the loved one lying now beneath the clay.. 
Childhood's prayers will have been answered 
when at last my life is o'er. 
And I'll deem myself forever blessed, 
Can I 
meet again and listen to the one I've 
treasured dear, 
Whom the angels beckoned home with them to rest.

Ind I'll sing of uld Ireland, the land of my birth, 
I 
will sing of the great men that's been, 
Those deeds of renown shall shine round each heart 
They were great men that Ireland has seen. 
Cnonus. 
Then here's to the sons of old Ei 
Go Bragh, 
May the memory of their names still be green, 
On sea, or on coast, let us drink off this toast, 
To the great men that Ireland has seen. 
O'Connell you know, as all hi st
ory 
does 
show, 
Was a 
statesman; whose equal was few, 
At the great Parliament, he did often represent, 
That the wrongs of old Ireland were true. 
And Emmet the martyr, he fought for our cause, 
Like a 
laurel his name it keeps green, 
He died for his country and Liberty's laws, 
Those were great men that Ireland has seen. 
Cho. 
And then we had Sarsfield who conquered each foe, 
And never was known for to yield, 
The foeman would quake, aye, and tremble and shako, 
When his war horse would enter the field; 
And then as for poets there is no land I'm sure, 
Where such brilliant genius has been, 
There was Grattan and Lover, and famous Tom Moore,. 
Those were great men that Ireland has seen. 
Cho. 
But though those great men have now passed away, 
Old Erin shall not be alone, 
We have men that would die for their country to-day, 
And a 
parliament wish of their own; 
But may God guide and guard them to do what is right, 
May they harbor no rancor or spleen, 
But when honor demands them they valiantly fight, 
Like the great men that Ireland has seek.

nice little cabin that's built with rand, 
In the beautiful County Kildare, 
I've got acres of land, and men at command, 
And I 
have always a 
shilling to spare. 
Oeh! I 
didn't come here, boys, in search of a

Then call for your glasses, just have what you want, 
And whatever the damage I'll pay;

For I'm the man you don't meet every day. 
When I 
landed in Glasgow, what a

As I

There was Felix O'Donough, blind Barney MeGurk,

Lonely and weary, poor, homeless, forsaken, 
Out in the cold bitter hours of the night, 
andering far away, while fear awaken, 
Dread of the fast coming sunbeams of light. 
Far from the home and the pleastres of childhood, 
With vile companions an exile from joy ; 
Longing once more for the charms of the wildwood, 
And for dear mother to welcome her boy. 
CHORUS. 
Go for my boy for I 
know lie's heart broken, 
Bring him once more to life's sunshine and joy, 
Thus in the old home a 
dear voiel has spoken, 
Mother is waiting to welcome her boy. 
Cold is the night , and the wintry wind blowing, 
Chills the poor wanderer. friendless, afar ; 
While in the darkness, which way is he going? 
Must he repose ' neath the pale evening star ? 
Wine is a 
mocker, then why is he seeking.

While a 
sweet voice now is tenderly speaking,

Oh ! how she peers in the face of each stranger, 
Eager to see her boys smiles once again ; 
Longing and praying to shield him from danger, 
Anxious to care for and soothe him in pain. 
Lone is the heart of that poor mother waiting, 
Wrinkled and gray, for one moment of joy ; 
While with his evil companions he's straying, 
Far from the mother who longs for her boy. 
Go for my boy, tk4. 
blase he was pure as the babe in the manger, 
But friends were false, and they led hint astray, 
Par from his home he has wandered a 
stranger, 
Reckless through drink, as you see him to-day! 
But who can tell how his heart has been saddened, 
When he has dreamed of lo:it friendship and joy, 
With no sweet thoughts when his brain has been inaddeszti 
Mother would welcome her wandering boy. 
Go for my boy, dr.s.

Let cowardly slanderers say what they will, 
Against the dear land of my birth, 
But 1 
will maintain she always will be; 
The grandest old spot on the earth. 
Some say with a 
sneer, we are cowards at heart, 
Pit for nothing but drinking potheen, 
But I 
throw back the villainous lie in their teeth, 
They're as brave as the shamrock is green. 
CHORUS. 
Pat he may be foolish and very often wrong, 
Pat's got a 
temper that don't last very long, 
Pat is fond of jollity, as everybody knows, 
There never was a 
coward where the shamrock grows. 
If ever he weeps at the voice of distress, 
Don't blame him, his heart is too warm, 
His family over the ocean, perhaps, 
Must weather black poverty's storm. 
Don't sneer at his sorrows, or laugh at his tears, 
Assist, at least, if you can, 
Remember that Pat on many a 
field, 
Has proved that he is a 
true man. 
Choroff_ 
Remember the Celts and the Saxons are bound, 
By the ties of pure brotherly love; 
Come test him again, and you'll find him as true 
As the stars in the heavens above. 
And always give honor where honor is due, 
Let hands join'd in friendship be seen, 
For he who despises a 
man for his name, 
Is not fit for a 
country or queen.

MUSIC BY STEPIDEP ADAMS, 
By the blue Alsatian mountains, 
Dwelt a 
maiden young and fair; 
Like the careless flowing fountains 
Were the ripples of her hair. 
Were the ripples of her hair; 
Angel mild, her eyes so winning, 
ingel bright her happy smile, 
When beneath the fountain span:ling. 
A- de, A-de, Ade, 
Such songs will pass away; 
Tho' the blue Alsatian mountains, 
Seem to watch and wait alway! 
By the blue Alsatian mountains, 
Many spring-times bloomed and r44eSed, 
And the maiden by the fountains, 
Saw she lost her hopes at last, 
She lost her hopes at last. 
And she withered, like a 
flower, 
That is waiting for the rain; 
She will never see the stranger, 
Where the fountains fall again.

The years have passed away, 
But the blue Alsatian mountains, 
Seen' to watch and wait alway. 
By the blue Alsatian mountains, 
Came a 
stranger in the spring, 
And he lingered by the fountains, 
Just to hear the maiden sing, 
Just to bear the maiden sing; 
Just to whisper in the moonlight, 
Words the sweetest she had known, 
Just to charm away the hours, 
Till her heart was all his own. 
A- de, A- de, A-de, 
Such dreams must pass away.

PARODY ON EMPTY CRADLE. 
WRITTEN AND SUNG BY CHAS. GLIDDEN. 
Once I 
owned a 
yellow dog his name was 
Towser Jenkins, 
A butcher cut his tail off with a 
cleaver; 
Towser had his trade-mark on all the cats in town, 
And when he spotted one he'd never leave her, 
He wore his legs off stumpey, 
Chaseing milk carts round the country, 
But the little house is empty where we ties him, 
A 
policeman spotted Towser, put some arsenic 
in his grub. 
Empty is the dog-house Towser's pizened. 
CIIORUS. 
He's gone to look for rats in the happy hunting gronnde 
He died this morning while the sun was rising; 
The frees have all turned out to hunt up a 
new 
lunch route, 
Empty is the dog-house Towser's pizened, 
Oh! how that dog would grin, when a 
tramp 
would look at him. 
1
11e used to put bay-windows in their breeches; 
Wore the hair all off his ribs, 
Chaseiug eats around corn cribs, 
Ead bunions on his knees from jumping ditches, 
On his nose he had two blisters, 
Where the rats chewed off his whiskers, 
When he was asleep they'd paralyze him. 
But now he's gone and dusted, 
And his chest prstector's busted, 
Empty is the dog-house Towser's pizened. 
CHORUS. 
He has gone to hunt for liver, 
'Way acrossed the Swanee river, 
No more in the sewer we'll baptise him, 
No more he'll homeward sail, 
With tin can's upon his tail, 
Emptv is the dog-house-Towser's pizened.

Came a

Just to talk of sheeps and cowses, 
And to hear that maiden sing. 
Just to hear that maiden sing, 
Oh! he spoke about his barnyard, 
Of his chickens and his hog; 
But she thought he was giving her tar'', 
So she called her yaller dog. 
Hurrah, hurrah, hurrah!

But left the bosom of his trousos, 
For the dog to chew that day.

And when she turned and smiled on me, 
How happy I 
did seem. 
CHORUS. 
This vision floated past my sight just like a 
happy dream, 
I 
never can forget her, with eyes of bonnie blue, 
She is so fair, I 
do declare, my bonnie little Lou, 
She is so fair, I 
do declare, my bonnie little Lou. 
(Dance.) 
I 
smiled on her and raised my hat, 
She blushed and hung her head, 
My heart kept going pit-a-pat, 
I 
scarce knew what I 
said. 
Pray, pardon me, then, miss, I 
said, 
I 
hope I 
don't intrude; 
She raised her eye, and winked so sly. 
My pretty little Lou.

While strolling through the avenue, 
A 
cottage neat I 
saw; 
A 
maiden dressed in pink and blue, 
Was standing at the door. 
Her rosy cheeks they were so awed, 
Her eyes shone bright and gay, 
• 
And on her bosom rested neat, 
A 
rose perfumed bouquet. 
I 
raised my hat she bowed her head, 
Soon .by her side I 
stood; 
And then sweet loving words were said. 
That made my heart feel good. 
CHORUS. 
Oh I 
she's the sweetest flower here. 
And she's the dearest.

She's a 
lilly pure and true, 
A 
fragrant mignonette, 
A 
morning-glory dipped in dew, 
A 
purple violet; 
A 
tulip white, and red rose fair, 
The gayest of the gay; 
She's all the flowers sweet and rank 
My rose perfumed bouquet. 
One day while standing by her side, 
I 
thought I 
would confess; 
I 
asked my love to be my bride, 
She softly whispered " yes," 
Her answer filled me with new life. 
It made me glad and gay, 
• 
To know that she would be my wits, 
My rose perfumed bouquet. 
Now in a 
cottage of our own, 
One painted white and gray, 
I 
dwell in peace and love alone, 
With my rose perfumed bouquet.

Here we are two factory lads, 
From Lancashire we came, 
Our parents in the cotton mill 
Are working now at home. 
But trade was slack, and pay is bad, 
So they sent us here 
To try and show you all the way 
They dance in Lancashire.' 
CHORUS. 
We 
will make the wooden clogs go tap, tap, tap, 
If you'll but give a 
cheer, 
And 'twill give us great delight, 
To show you here to-night, 
How they dance in Lancashire. 
When at night our work is done, 
We dance out on the green, 
The lads and lassies all are there, 
With smiling faces seen. 
Now we've told you all our history, 
If you think us sincere, 
Bestow your kind applause upon 
These lads from Lancashire.

I 
left de dear old home many years ago to roam, 
From de sunny south, de land where I 
was born; 
And dem happy days am past, dey will never 
come again, 
And I 
often feel dejected and forlorn. 
Old massa and old misse dey always treat me well, 
And I 
never had cause to complain, 
But now they're dead and gone, and left me all alone, 
And dem sunny days I 
never see again. 
Now de banjo's laid away, and de fiddle it am still, 
No more de darkies sing around de door, 
For ole massa and ale misse they are sleeping side 
by side, 
And those sunny days are gone forevermore. 
(Dance.) 
Many years have past and gone, though I 
rem ember well, 
The orange groves and sweet magnolia trees, 
And de mocking-bird so gay, he would sing 
de live-long day, 
And their notes were wafted in the gentle breeze. 
And den de little children were playing round the door 
Wid happy hearts so light and free from pain, 
Now I 
often heave a 
sigh, for I'm old and 
soon must die, 
t And those happy days I 
never see again.

While rambling down a 
country road 
Not knowing what to do; 
I 
beheld a 
fair young damsel 
With eyes of heavenly blue. 
She smiled on me so sweetly, 
Just like a 
young gazelle, 
My heart was captivated quite, 
In love with her I 
fell. 
CHORUS. 
She's sweeter than the lilies in the valley,', 
This pretty little maiden I 
shall marry, 
I'm as happy as the little birds in springtime, 
For this pretty maiden promised to be mine, 
So now 
married be, and I'll live so happily 
With my pretty little Dandelion. 
Dance. 
I 
asked her bashful, how it was 
That on me she smiled so sweet; 
That afternoon in springtime, 
When we by chance did meet. 
She said it was my dashing style, 
My elegance and grace, 
That stole away her sweet young heart, 
But put mine in its place.

TAIL FROM MY ANGEL BROTHER'S 
SHIRT. 
BY CHARLEY PETE, FOR GALLAGHER Sr WEST. SUNG 
BY THEM WITH GREAT SUCCESS AT THE PEOPLES 
THEATRE, ST. LOUIS, MO. 
I've a 
little piece of calico, I 
ever fondly praise, 
In the inside pockets of my yeller pants, 
And over it I 
oft have shed great big three ounce tears, 
Likewise my sisters, cousins, and my aunts. 
But I 
don't want to knock you cold with the 
dizzy Pinafore, 
Were Ito do it why your feeling I 
would hurt, 
But this little piece of rag, I 
love att,d hold so 
dear through life, 
IS 
the tail from my angel brother's shirt. 
CHORUS. 
Wrapped up in my pocket in a 
yeller almanac, 
Though it's covered all o'er with grease and dirt, 
Were I 
hungry and wanted bread, I 
would not 
give up a 
thread, 
Of the tail from my angel brother's shirt. 
How oft-times he's been licked, and how often 
he's been kicked, 
On this little piece of rag I 
love so true; 
And how often for protection to my certain recollectiCa 
It,has served him as a 
shield from mother's shoe. 
And the day I 
now recall while climbing o'er the wall, 
The wall was high and caused him to exert; 
When the threads they gave away and I 
took 
from him that day, 
This tail from my angel brother's shirt.

MY DARLING, BUT TALKATIVE WIFE. 
WORDS BY C. W. MARK. 
MUSIC BY J. SCHWENSECK. 
COPYRIGHT 1881, BY WM. J. A. LIEDER. 
ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. 
Some people they grumble the day in and out. 
Over very small trifles of life. 
But I 
think I've the right to tell you about 
My darling, but talkative wife 
A 
day cannot pass but I 
get a 
new name, 
You numbskull, you fool, dunce, and such, 
For me to talk thus you might say ' tis a 
shame, 
but really, my wife talks too much. 
Cnouus. 
Now John, come and kiss me, oh ! do have a 
care, 
One'd think you were kissing a 
mule; 
Why John, yortv'e been drinking to-day, I 
declare! 
You're leading the life of a-fool, 
Before we were married, you promised you know. 
We'd lead a 
most happy gay life; 
But since we are married I 
find 'tisn't so, 
I'm only your talkative wife. 
One evening while kissing she said have a 
care, 
One'd think you were kissing a 
mule, 
I 
said as a 
joke, I 
just kissed one, my dear, 
I 
know not that I 
was a 
fool. 
She scratched me, she pinched me, she wept and she said 
You're mean, you're a 
brute, so you are, 
And she cried as she tore some nice locks from my head. 
I'm going right back to my ma. 
Chorus. 
Now here at election I 
bet a 
new hat, 
Of course ' twas a 
very small cost, 
But she keeps saying why did yon do that ? 
Why bet on the men that have lost. 
There's Jenkins next door, whose as cute as a horse, 
Has several new suits while you've none; 
Now when did he get them, he won them of course, 
• 
By betting on those that have won. 
Chorus. 
I 
thought I'd find peace in the club room at night, 
I 
went there one evening to test, 
Oh ! then I 
found peace, yes, and then I 
got tight, 
And came home, I 
shant tell the rest. 
One thing I 
will say, though, to all you young men, 
When married, oh ! guard against strife; 
If you don't you will wish you were single again, 
That's if you've a 
talkative wife. Chorus.
