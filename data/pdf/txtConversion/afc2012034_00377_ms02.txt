0-30 Introduction to Joseph Rideau, who goes by the nickname "June."  
 
052 Has been working with horses for 35 years. He was young when he 
started. Started galloping when young, cleaning stalls, grooming and 
wrapping legs. He has also trained.  
 
1:47 Started with Mr. Stemmons. He used to train at the Evangeline 
Race track, both quarter horses and thoroughbreds. He used to ride, but 
now considers himself too old. He was taking care of 20 head, in 
training. He cares for 6, right now. He has a helper. When there were 
twenty horses, he had 6 helpers and he rubbed 3 horses.  
 
3:23 Mr. Stemmons came and got him and he's been there ever since and 
has worked nowhere else. He gets to the farm at five in the morning and 
quits when he gets done. Everybody starts at 4:00 a.m. so they can get 
them out before it gets hot. He cleans stalls three times a day and makes 
sure that there is water and hay at all times. He works seven days a 
week.

5:12 He was born in Carencro. He has two sons, who work with the 
horses.  
 
5:50 He showed his sons how to gallop. They are galloping and 
grooming. They exercise horses.  
 
6:33 Joseph stopped riding (exercising) about 3 years ago. He used to 
break babies. He quit because he was getting too old to fall. When you 
fall, it hurts now.  
 
7:57 They used to have twenty to train. That was the only job heâ€™s ever 
had.  
 
9:20 Horses are fed at 5:00 a.m. After they eat, they have a bath and then 
they walk until they're dry. They sit in the stall and groom them up and 
wrap their legs. They have a track and starting gates. When they go to a 
race they haul them right from the Stemmons' farm. They are walked for 
twenty minutes. After that they rest. He stays with them all day. Their 
day is concluded at 5:00 p.m. They take them to the track and after the 
race, they cool off. They load them in the trailer and bring them back 
here. He races at Delta which has night races.
