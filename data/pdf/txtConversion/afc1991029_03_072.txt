 Wheeled dock on Long Lake, known locally as a guay, found
 
on all lakes in the study area; the wheels allow the dock
 
to be removed from the water before winter, thus avoiding

 The Fort Kent Hotel on Main Street in downtown Fort Kent;
 
it  no  longer  operates  as  a  hotel,  but  does  have  an
 
operating restaurant  (The Brass Lantern)  and bar;  one of
 
two  places  in  Fort  Kent  which  regularly  feature  live
 
music
 
13-15
 Fieldworker Ray  Brassieur  examines various  pieces  of  a
 
demolished  barn  in  Eagle  Lake,  ME;  the  barn,  which
 
belonged  to  Ethel  Gagnon  (who  lived  in  a house  on  the
 
property),  was estimated by her to be approximately 100
 
years old,  and was partially constructed of hewn timbers
 
and square-cut nails
 
16-17
 Brassieur talks to Ethel Gagnon at the back door of her
 
house
 
18
 outbuilding behind the Gagnon house, which she called the
 
"tool  shed;"
 many of the residences  in the study area
 
have
 one

 more
 outbuildings,

 the
 
agricultural base of the original settlement
 
19
 View  of  the  Gagnon  house  from  the  rear;  the  addition
 
which  runs  the  length  of  the  house  is  typical  of  the
 
study area,  and often results from the enclosure of what
 
was once an outdoor "summer kitchen"

 Potato barrels;  Herman,  like almost  all  farmers  in the
 
study
 area,
 has
 abandoned
 the
 use
 of
 barrels
 in
 
harvesting  his  crop,  but  uses  those  he  still  has  for
 
storing other things  (tools,  trash,  etc.)
 
9
 Herman's grandson Danny riding his all-terrain vehicle.
 
These ATVs are quite common  in the study area,  and are
 
used for both pleasure riding and work;  Danny sometimes
 
helps out around the farm with his,  hitching up a small
 
trailer and clearing rocks out of the fields

 Barn on Paul  Freeman's property on  State Highway  11  in
 
Wallagrass,  ME;  the long curve of this barn's roofline,
 
which Freeman says he designed himself,  is atypical
 
13
 Freeman's house and barn
 
14-15
 Freeman's  house,  probably built  in the  late  nineteenth
 
century;  Freeman termed the construction madrier, which
 
could  mean  either  log  or  plank.
 The  proportions  and
 
roof line  of  this  house  are  quite  typical  of  the  study
 
area,  as is the outside cellar entrance.
 The small arch
 
over the front door, while not common,  is found on houses
 
throughout the region.

 Eagles are a

in the area,  and Daigle remains one of the more common
 
names  (French d'aigle translates as of the eagle)

18-19
 The  Roy  house,  an  eighteenth  century  log  house;  this
 
house was disassembled, moved to the Village Acadien, and
 
reassembled.  However, it appears that the reconstruction
 
is not precise; the house was built using piece-sur-piece 
logs with dovetail joinery,  and the dovetails may have
 
been sawn off during disassembly.

(right)  in front of Perrault's barn  (identity of third
 
person in center unknown)
 
View of Perrault's barn from the northwest corner.
 The
 
form of this barn--relatively small, no side pens, and a
 
simple
 gabled
 roof--was
 probably
 used
 in
 barns
 
constructed early in the French settlement of the study
 
area.
 However,  the materials  in this barn  (e.g.  mill-
sawn lumber and round machine-made nails)  mark it as an
 
early  twentieth  (or  possibly  late  nineteenth)  century
 
example.
 
View of  the barn  from the west  side,  towards  the main
 
road  (State Highway 11);  the small window near the peak
 
of the roof would have been used for loading/unloading.
 
Sliding  doors  in  the  side  of  the  barn  through  which
 
equipment and livestock could be moved;  there is also a
 
set of doors in the opposite side, and arrangement common
 
in the study area.

 Sliding mechanism on barn door; each door had four small
 
iron wheels,  two per side,  which rolled across the iron
 
guide piece

View of barn from the southeast corner.
 Note the use of
 
shakes on the bottom half of this wall,  which is on the
 
side enclosing the livestock pen;  the shakes were used
 
here due to their superior insulating qualities.
 
The  rear  portion  of  the  house,
 which
 is  of
 late
 
nineteenth century construction;  the wide door was used
 
for a carriage.
 This  attachment  of a garage  of  sorts
 
directly  to  the  house,  using  the  same  wall  and  roof
 
lines, seems unusual; the garage was converted to part of
 
the living space of the house during a renovation.
 The
 
house  is now owned by Mr.  Perrault's daughter Phyllis,
 
who uses it as a part-time residence.

this  section was painted to match the rest of the barn
 
just before we left the area in late July].

 Interior roof construction of Hamlin twin barn; this type

this  barn,  is  commonly  used  in  the  study  area.
 Also
 
typical is the absence of a ridgepole.
 
14-15
 Side wall of Hamlin twin barn;  this  is the exterior of
 
the wall through which slides 8-10 were taken.  The front
 
(left)  part of the barn was separated by a wall from the
 
rear,  hence the side-by-side doorways.

 The  unoccupied house  across  the  road  (U.S.  Highway  1

from the Hamlin twin barn.
 We presume,  but do not know
 
for certain, that the house and barn were  (and may still
 
be)  part of the same property.
 The form of the house is
 
not uncommon;  its size and orientation,  with the gabled
 
side
 facing
 the
 road,
 suggest
 twentieth
 century
 
construction.

 The home of Geraldine and Ernie Chasse in  St.  David, ME.
 
This fairly large house is of mid-nineteenth century log

enclosed.
 Twentieth  century  re-modeling  includes  the
 
addition of a second floor over the former kitchen,  the
 
rearrangement of interior walls,  and the brick facade.
