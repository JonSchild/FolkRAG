Abstract: Travis Nolcox is descended from the Nolcox family who settled in Gibson County,
Indiana in the late 1830s. They were originally free people of color from Virginia who moved to
Tennessee around the time that Tennessee became a state. The Nolcox and the Lyles families
lived next to each other in Tennessee, married into each other’s families and moved together to
Indiana when Tennessee whites rewrote the state constitution making it illegal for
African-descended people to vote or to own guns (for more information on the Lyles and Nolcox
families see The Bone and Sinew of the Land by Anna-Lisa Cox). Travis Nolcox lives and works
his family farm in Gibson County, Indiana. He is a community leader who was a member of the
national federal USDA Board for about a decade. His mother, Mrs. Vivian Nolcox, was also
interviewed for this collection.
