SALLY SWEET 5109 A3
Bill Jackson Arvin, 1941
Oh its onct I had a little gal Her name was Sally Sweet Her hair was stretched so tight on
her head An' her shoes was full of feet.
O she bad ears like a Japanese fan And neck like a long giraffe -An' a mouth like a yearlin'
calf- And every time I seen that girl I always had to laugh.
He Ha Ha He Ha Ha Hee ha ha ha ha He ha ha ho ha ha He ha ha ha ha.
Me an' Sal we was a walkin' For pleasure we was seekin' We went down to the
preacherman's house And found that he'd been drinkin'. O the preacher says if you'll take
Sal She'll be your better half- He looked at me and me at Sal And we all began to laugh-
He Ha Ha He Ha Ha Hee ha ha ha ha He ha ha ho ha ha He ha ha ha ha.
Me and Sal we was a-walkin' For pleasure we was seekin I missed her mouth and kissed
her nose And the darn thing it was leaking She had the croup from eating soup Thought
she was a goner Had sore eyes from lookin' at pies At the grocers around the corner.
He Ha Ha He Ha Ha Hee ha ha ha ha He ha ha ho ha ha He ha ha ha ha.
