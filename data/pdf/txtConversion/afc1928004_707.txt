Cincinnati's High-Toned Tramps. 
By Charlie Frye, 
Sung by Stanford- & Ruks411. 
Oh ! here we are two bent up tramps 
From Cincinnati we came so fine; 
But now we're broke and got no stamps, 
We blowed it for booze and wine. 
A 
box-car carries us o'er the land, 
We eat wlmiever we'le in luck, 
One of us gets what we wear, 
And the other skirmishes for the chuck 
CHORUS. 
All we want is pie and cake, 
Pork and beans gives us the cranipt, 
We're known at every railway stop 
As Cincinnati's high-toned tramps 
fou ought to see us punish pie. 
And get away with a 
big beef st.)at4 
We never pay for what we eat. 
For begging we take the cake. 
And now kind friends we'll leave ion all, 
It's pretty near the freight-traik, tble, 
To-night we'll eat our ham and egg,, 
In Cincinnati o'er the Rhine.

Decoration Day. 
RECITATION. 
By Joe Russell. 
To-day there are people kneeling. 
On many a 
lonely grave; 
Offering up a 
prayer to God, 
The unknown soul to save. 
They come with sweetest flowers to strew 
Upon each grassy mound, 
While praying for a 
loved one, 
Who perhaps, was never found. 
To a 
lonely grave a 
woman, 
Is seen to go and kneel, 
Her tears fall fast, we little know, 
The sorrow she must feel. 
Perhaps it is her husband 
That caused her all the pain 
Or a 
loving son who went away, 
And never returned again. 
So whether it is the northern blue, 
Or the southern coat of gray, 
Fresh flowers on their grave well straw, 
On, Denorstion Dxy,

The Hut by the Old. Mill Stream. 
Written by Joe Russell 
Sweet visions of childhood's bright happy dream, 
Of innocent youth long ago; 
To-night I 
am thinking of boyhood days, 
And the hut where the old creek flows. 
I 
see the old mill standing there 
In the sunlight's mellow gleam, 
can see my mother in the door 
In the hut by lhe old mill stream. 
Cnonus. 
I 
see the old mill standing there, 
In the sunlight's mellow gleam, 
I 
can see my mother in the door, 
In the hut by.the old mill stream. 
Sweet memory to-night goes back to the days 
When I 
played 'neath the old elm tree, 
And I 
am longing again to'watch the old mill 
And its wheel which was music to me. 
But mother and friends have all passed away, 
And oft in memory's dream, 
can see my angel mother's face, 
In the hut by the old mill stream.

Sung by Stanford & Russ 11, in their act Across the Plaine. 
Good-evening to you, one and all, 
We've a 
few words to say, 
About the time we started West,

It was a 
pleasant day. 
We got as far as Omaha, 
We tried to do our best. 
But the divel take the Indians, 
They drove us from the west.

Hurry up Erastus the train am coming on, 
Yes, I 
believe the train am coming on, 
And with our pick and shovels, 
We tried to do our best, 
But the divel take the Indians, 
They drove us from the west. 
We are going back to New York town, 
And there we will remain, 
We've got to lay around here 
Till we catch t.lis coming train, 
And when we do get home again, 
You bet we'll take a 
rest, 
And the divil take the Indians, 
They drove us from the west.

The Outcasts Return. 
Written and sung with auccess by Stanford & Russell. 
One more we are back again to our childhood's brightest 
home, 
T at we left here about three years ago; 
And li tle we thought that thus we would roam, 
Back here in our rags filled with woe. 
We are tired and weary and ready to fall, 
From our journey across toe country o'er, 
We are cold and hungry and unable to call, 
And afraid t') knock at the door. 
CIIORMS. 
We're afraid to knock at the door, 
Were afraid to knock at the door, 
To meet our fathers, our mothers, our sisters and our 
brothers, 
We're afraid to knock at the door. 
We will 
nook at the door and if asked to come in, 
We will take c 
urage and try to be bold; 
e 
never could stand this shivering wind, 
We w uld perish out there in the cold. 
We dread to meet them though we know they'll be glad; 
To welcome us wanderers home. 
We know they will forgive us though we made them 
feel sad, 
And. never again will we roam.

THE ORDER OF TEE TRAMPS. 
By Billy Stanford. 
The Roble order of the tramps. 
They travel this country o'er, 
They never work or never will, 
And come along by the score. 
They steal the farmers chickens. 
And have no occupation, 
And when they want to steal a 
ride. 
They'll walk to a 
water station. 
Oh! it's all the same in sun or rain, 
They'll catch that freight train sure; 
And when she whistles for to go, 
These tramps begin to smile. 
But they get put off at the next station, 
Which is about three miles. 
Thf-n they start to walk along the track, 
Io pay their fair they have no stamps. 
And wa k 
till they come to the water tanl;, 
The noble, noble order of the tramps. 
So now kind friends I'll bid good bye, 
I 
think I've told you all. 
About these bums and noble chums, 
Who live upon their gall-
In winter time they are in jail, 
in summer on the road, 
And when they want to catch a 
freight, 
Why this way is their mode. 
Chorus. 
SHE WOULD MASH. 
Originally sung by VIRGINIA STICKNEL 
Music by W ILLIAM CARTEL 
Come listen awhile to my dit, 
I'm sure it won't hurt you a 
bit, 
If you don't like the style of my song, 
I'll very soon get up and git. 
One day I 
was walking the street, 
A 
fair damsel I 
chanced for to meet. 
I 
winked one eye—she looked one eye, 
And smiled on me ever so sweet. 
CHORUS. 
ger hair in golden ringlets hung. 
Her eyes were Heaven's own blue, 
Gaiters on her tiny feet 
I 
think were number two. 
Her form was most exquisite, 
Her style was all the rage, 
But she would mash, you bet she wet* 
For she was just the age. 
I 
asked her if she would be mine, 
She said she'd ask papa; 
The old man thought I 
had more wealth 
Than the other one by far. 
So he gave his consent right away, 
And I 
thought I'd a 
dear precious wife, 
So I 
settled down, just outside of town, 
And intended to be happy through life. 
CHORUS. 
But when I 
went out to see the boys 
And left my wife at home, 
She said she was contented 
And loved to be alone. 
But I 
saw her kiss a 
chap last night, 
Which set me in a 
rage, 
But she would, you know, of course she weekt, 
For she was just about the age. 
THE TURNPIKE GATE. 
As sung by REYNOLDS & Wsuzse. 
am thinking of the day when but a 
little child, 
I 
wandered o'er the meadows to the hill, 
Where the sweet flowers grew and forever growing wild 
And the stream e'er flowed by the mill. 
But the old mill house has gone to decay, 
I 
loved it and so did darling Kate, 
And the miller he lies sleeping where the gentle breeze 
blow, 
And we played 'neath the Turnpike gate. 
CHORUS. 
For the Turnpike gate is the pride of my heart, 
I 
loved it and so did darling Kate, 
When she sits beside me now, there's a 
smile upon her 
brow, 
That reminds me of the Turnpike gate. 
And the old school-house has gone to decay, 
Where the schoolmaster heard us recite, 
And those happy, happy days have faded from our view. 
When our little hearts were filled with delight. 
And when the school was out we would wander to the 
spring, 
Where I 
drew for you pictures on your slate, 
And those happy childhood days they'll come again no 
more, 
When we played oi, the Turnpike gate.

UNDER THE LILACS, 
Written and sung by Barr DOM& 
Ohl I 
love a 
charmer—a 
sweet little maid— 
With eyes like the stars in the sky, 
Her home is a 
cot in a 
green, mossy glade, 
Where a 
swift flowing brook ripples by; 
'Tis fair as an Eden with beautiful flowers, 
And there day by day at her side, 
Together we talk of the bright happy hours 
We'll pass when I 
claim her my bride. 
Guam 
Under the lilacs, under the lilacs, 
Talking of love on a 
bright summer's &kV. 
Under the libwst, tinder the lilacs, 
Together we lovingly pass time away. 
One warm day in summer we sat ' neath the shade, 
Her hand within mine I 
held fast, 
So earnestly talking to her, I'm afraid 
I 
knew not how quickly time passed; 
I 
begged her to join me through life's coming hours. 
She promised that she'd be my wife, 
How I 
bless the day, when 'neath the lilac's sweet flowers, 
I 
woo, her, my darling, for lie. 
Under the Macs, cite.

The spell is past. the dream is o'er,

One heart is crushed to droop and die, 
And for relief must hea,v'nward fly. 
The once bright smile has faded, gone, 
And given way to looks forlorn. 
Despite her grandeur's wicked flame, 
She stoops to blush beneath her slaune. 
Cnotus. 
We never speak as we pass by, 
Altho' a 
tear bedims her eye, 
I 
know she thinks of her past life, 
When we were loving man and wife. 
In guileless youth I 
sought her side, 
And she became my virtuous bride; 
Our lot was peace so fair and bright, 
One sunny day, no gloomy night, 
No life on earth more pure than ours, 
In that dear home ' midst field and flower& 
Until the tempter came to Nell; 
..azzled her,—alas I he fell. 
Ohorus. 
In gilded 1

How her heart aches, her sad face tells, 
She fain would smile, seem bright and cay, 
But conscience steals her peace awity,

What is Right. 
Written by Joe. M. Lawrence. 
Sung by Lawrence & Mott. 
There are seme hings that really affects me, 
My mind is completely perplexed, 
Whether to allow Tallmege or Ingersoll direct me 
I 
wonder what they will do next. 
Talmage says there is a 
hsaven. 
And endeavors to give us a 
sight 
While Ingersoll tells, that there is no hell, 
Pray tell which of thorn is right. 
Talmage preaches most every Sunday,' 
To a 
congregation both large and refined, 
He says he is preaching for sinners, 
But of the plate he ke€ ps them in mind. 
Ingersoll delivers his lectures, 
And charges admission each night. 
He says he does it fc,r money, 
Pray tell which of them is right. 
The penal code now is enacted, 
To the poor man an obnoxious law, 
On Sunday your mouth keep contractf d, 
Or they'll arrest you for working your jaw. 
Grover Cleveland for goveinor was elected, 
For three years we'll keep him in sight, 
If he keeps from John Kelly, repeals p_nal codes, 
We know he'll be doing just right. 
Mrs Langtry has come to this country, 
She came here to collar our cash, 
Since here she has the effrontry 
On poor Freddie Gebhard to mash. 
They say that she is an actress, 
But it poor one appeav; to our sight, 
For loo s, Yankee gals can knock her clean out 
You can bet your sweet life we are right.

PINAFORE. 
Words by Joz PETTINGILL, of the Alizincer FMB. 
When I 
was young and had no sense, 
I 
went to a 
picnic and I 
beat the fence, 
I 
had just dropped over and hid in the grass, 
When a 
copper hauled off and struck me in the neck. 
And for beating that picnic so carefully, 
I 
got six months in the penitentiary. 
(Repeat last two lines.) 
When I 
arrived at the age of eleven or more. 
I 
stole all the sweet potatoes from the grocery store, 
I 
stayed out late at nights and wouldn't go home, 
Just look at me now Fm noth:ng but a 
none, 
But I 
stole those potatoes so carefully, 
That now I 
am the owner of a 
grocery. 
(Repeat last two lines ) 
See That

As Sung by JAMES HOET, of the AMERICAN Fors. 
Oh, see that angel band, they're calling me away, 
I 
ain't got long to tarry, just hear that trumpet play, 
When the sun comes up in the meadow -.

the lark, 
'We work all day on massa's farm and then dance after dark 
CHORUS. 
Keep the banjo ringing, we'll get dar just in time, 
Keep the banjo ringing, we want to go to heaven when we 
die. 
Then come and join the band, the train is on the way, 
Don't you hear the whistle blowing, we ain't got long to 
stay, 
The silver stars are shinining on wings of glory bright, 
We'll meet you in the morning all beaming with delight.

WHAT I'D DO. 
Written by PAUL ALLEN, and sung with great success by LESTER & 
ALLEN, at TONY PASTOR'S THEATRE, New York. 
Candidates running for office tell, 
The voters they will prove true; 
Now if I 
was ruler of America, 
I'll tell you what I 
would do; 
I'd make Dr. Tanner President, 
To cut down expenses to one meal; 
And Grant would be the Treasurer, 
For you know he'd never steal. 
Put John Kelly for Vice-President, 
He'd make millionaires of the Tammany Ring; 
I'd put Blaine and Roscoe Conkling, 
Making shoes up in Sing Sing; 
I'd put Beecher in some female college, 
And let him practice what he'd preach; 
And Ben Butler inspecting the rotten navy, 
Or counting the breakers at Manhattan Beach. 
I'd put Sammy Tilden in the Custom House, 
The robbers oilt he'd sweep; 
Garfield Superintendent of the Police, 
He'd hire Chinese to work cheap; 
I'd put Dennis Kearney cleaning the streets, 
Hancock and English would be in their joy; 
I'd make Garfield go back upon the Canal, 
And use Arthur for a 
telegraph boy.

PARODY ON NEVER TAKE THE HORSE-
SHOE FROM THE DOOR. 
Written and sung by Pim, DR/MEMEL 
0:— 
There's a 
little sausage factory round the corner, 
Where you get the little weenies by the pound, 
And you ought to see the butcher on the watch, my boys, 
If he sees a 
first-class poodle dog around. 
Crronus: 
They will gather up the canines every morning, 
And throw them out behind the butcher's door; 
To one and all I 
give you timely warning, 
Never eat the weenies any more. 
There arc yellow dogs and terriers in the sausages 
And they do them up in any style you wish. 
And if you go in to a 
fine saloon, my boys, 
You will find that weenies is the leading dish. 
CrIOnr
. S : 
Now I 
like to eat as well as anybody, 
But, people, don't you think it is a 
sin 
To pay them fifteen cents for their poor whiskey, 
And have a 
yellow homeless dog thrown in. 
19 
P &BODY ON NEVER TAKE THE FIORSESHOii, 
FROM THE DOOR—Cox lux insp. 
Now the actors they all like to eat the sausages. 
Especially when they are on the mash; 
And if you go into a 
five cent boarding house, 
You will hear the people call them actor's hash. 
Just let an actor see an eight day poodle, 
Then right for a 
saloon his nob 
il will iteer; 
And very soon you'll see the actor loaded 
In bull tarriers and second handed beer. 
For the benefit of suffering humanity, 
And all my friends who usually guzzle; 
In the future you can get all the sausages you want, 
If they find a 
dog around without a 
muzzle. 
Then call the police around you every evening. 
Tell them they must not eat a 
hog; 
But have the superintendent to notify the butchers 
Every time they kill a 
yellow dog,

HASH -

Sung by Pettit et White with tremendous success. 
Gather around me brave and hold, 
If my song is new it can't be old, 
And if it's short it can't be long, 
And as it's right it can't be wrong, 
And as it's small it can't be tall, 
Of course there's more so that ain't alL 
Once there lived a 
colored man, 
And when he walked he never ran, 
When lie was born his life began, 
And Mary's lamb it was a

And he has no clothes so he don't need a

You will tell me, little darling, 
If you dearly love me yet. 
CHORUS. 
In the soft and gentle twilight, 
Where we often, love, have met, 
You will tell me, little darling, 
If you dearly love me yet. 
When the daisies dot the meadow, 
Shall we, dearest, meet again ? 
Will the summer zephyr kiss us 
When we wander down the lane ? 
Long ago we met and parted 
In the golden pastures bright, 
And since then, my little darling, 
Time has quickly taken flight. 
In the soft, & c. 
When in Heaven with the angels, 
Shall we, dearest, meet again ? 
Will we climb the hill together 
To the land that knows no pain? 
In that home no wail of sorrow 
Breaks the pure and loving heart, 
And I 
hope, my little darling, 
There we'll meet to never part.

WORIM BY SAMUEL N. 
MITCHELL. 
MUSIC BY HARRY LEIGHTON. 
When silver locks replace the gold, 
I'll love you, darling, as of old, 
And kiss the cheek where bloom'd the rose, 
Ere life had crept so near its close. 
The eyes that were so fair and bright, 
Still shed for me their loving light, 
And on your lips I 
plainly see 
The smile that's always dear to me. 
CHORUS. 
When silver locks replace the.gold, 
I'll love you, darling, as ofd 
old, 
And kiss the cheek where bloom'd the rose, 
Ere life had crept so near its close. 
When silver locks replace the gold, 
And love with some is growing old, 
I'll cling to you with all my heart, 
And death alone our love shall part; 
Thy face no more with ruby glows, 
The lily has replaced the rose, 
But still you are to me as dear, 
Your voice is just as sweet and clear. 
When silver locks, &c, 
When silver locks replace the gold, 
Our stories oft will be retold, 
And in life's last declining rays 
We'll catch a 
glimpse of other days; 
The hands that clasped each other true, 
The oldeit vigor will renew, 
And 'till life's busy dream is o'er 
I'll love you, darling, all the more.

Beautiful Snow. 
Ifilittes and composed by Btu DRYERS, and recited with rounds of sp. 
plause by DAN COLLYER. 
Oh the snow, the beautiful snow„ 
That flies in y3ut face wherever you go, 
That's tw'zted and twirled in the dreary street, 
Till it blinds your poor eyes and freezes your feet. 
Is 
all very fine, this " beautiful snow," 
If you've a 
blunt in your pocket, and somewhere to go; 
But the poet was born in the summer, I 
know, 
That finds something pretty in " beautiful snow." 
Beautiful, is it ? 
Humph, " beautiful snow." 
The thermometer just three degrees below, 
Your " benjamin hocked," not a 
cent in your " hick," 
And " beautiful snow" till you can't see a 
brick 
Li the sidewalks around in a 
dreary town, 
And that beautiful snow is still coming down. 
If I 
had a 
room with a 
fire all aglow, 
I 
could envy the " Guy" that wrote " Beautiful Snow.* 
Beautiful, is it ? "'Beautiful snow," 
When it falls on a 
sinner with nowhere to go. 
It seems to me now (I'm a 
practical man, 
And no lovesick damsel or innoce:f: iamb; 
Tberekr.re it cannot be expected, you know, 
To stand on. my head about " beautiful snow." 
It seems to me, though) that- the poet should go 
And bury himself in his " beautiful snow." 
"Beautiful snow from the heavens above, 
Pure as an angel, gentle as love." 
I 
wish they would keep it in heaven, not throw 
So much down on earth of that " beautiful snow." 
I" Gentle as love," how can they say so? 
See how it sticks ; it never will gc; 
Marcus 
April, May might come and might go, 
And still we'd be blest with that " beautiful snow."

BLUE AND GRAY. 
Oh, mother, what do they mean by blue, 
And what do they mean by gray. 
Was heard from the lips of a 
little child, 
As she bounded in from play. 
The mother's eyes tilled up with tears, 
She turned to her darling fair, 
And smoothed away from the sunny brow, 
Its treasures of golden hair. 
Why, mother's eyes are blue my sweet, 
And grandpa's hair is grey, 
And the love we bear our darling child, 
Grows stronger every day; 
But what did they—persisted the child— 
For I 
saw two cripples to- day, 
And one of them said he fought for the blue, 
The other, he fought for the gray. 
Now, no of the blue had lost a 
leg, 
The ether had but one arm; 
And both seemed worn and weary and se4, 
Yet their greeting was kind and warm. 
They told of battles of days gone by, 
Till it made my 
ng blood thrill. 
The leg wG' 
in the Wilderness fight, 
And the arm on Malvern Hill. 
They sat on the stone by the farm-yard gate, 
And talked for an hour more, 
Till their eyes grew bright, and their warm heerte seemed, 
With fighting their battles o'er, 
And parting at last with a 
friendly grasp, 
in a 
kindly, brotherly way; 
Each called on God, to speed the time, 
Uniting the blue end the gab_

Only a 
face at the window, 
Only a

Yet the look in the eyes as they meet mine, 
Still comes to me o'er and o'er. 
Only a 
word of greeting, 
Only a 
word, that was all; 
Yet all day in my heart it echo'd 
Like the sound of an angel's call. 
Only a 
smile of welcome, 
Only a 
smile as I 
passed; 
Yet that smile will still be remembered 
As long as my life shall last 
Only a

Only a

Yet there's naught that this wide world contain 
Half so dear as this woman to me.

On a 
cold winter's ev'ning, when bus'ness is done, 
And to your home you retire, 
What a 
pleasure it is to have a 
bright bouncing boy, 
One whom you love to admire; 
You hug him, and kiss him, you press him to your heart, 
What joy to your bosom ' twill bring; 
Then you place him on the carpet, 
And you'll hide behind the chair, 
And to please him you'll commence to sing: 
CHORUS: 
Peek-a-boo! peek-a-boo I 
Come from behind the chair! 
Peek-a-boo! peek-a-boo 
I 
see you hiding there ; 
Oh! you rascal. 
There. 
#0h, my heart's always light when at home with my wife, 
There joy and peace ever reign; 
With my boy on my knee I'm as happy as can be, 
I 
never knew care or pain; 
He's pretty, he's gentle, he's kind and he is good, 
And ev'ry thing nice, him I 
bring; 
Oh, if he attempts to cry 
When I 
am ztanding by, 
Just to please him I 
commence to sing: 
Peek-a-boo ! peek-a-boo! Sze. 
When the sunshine of youtl, fades, and age bends us low,— 
joys, like the birds, flown away; 
Then the smiles of our children ever brighten the path, 
Leading where loved ones do stray. 
The music and laughter we ever love to hear, 
Will beam like a 
rain-bow in spring; 
By the fire-side at night, 
With our hearts so free and light, 
We will listen while our children sing: 
Peek-a-boo I 
peek-a-boo!

Even more than tongue can tell, 
Little did I

You have wrecked the heart I

But forget you I 
never may.

And you believed them all they say, 
You are false but I'll forgive you, 
But forget you I 
never may.

One more word and all is over, 
Why are you unkind to me?

You are false but I'll forgive you,

Respectfully dedicated to Fayette Welsh, and sung with great

Let cowardly slanderers say what they may, 
Against the dear land of my birth; 
But I 
will maintain in spite of all foes, 
It's the clearest green spot on this earth. 
Some say we are cowards and fit for naught else 
But drinking our home-made potheen 
But I'll throw back the villainous lie in their face, 
We're as brave as the shamrock is green.

Pat may be foolish and very often wrong, 
Pat's got a 
temper which don't last very long, 
Pat is full of jollity as everybody knows. 
rdcut there never was a 
coward where the shamrock grows, 
Tho' oppress'd and insulted for hundreds of years 
By the foe who once conquered them, they 
Have left us the courage our forefather's had— 
For that they cannot take away. 
They kept learning from us, stole all we hold dea4, 
And crushed us till others cried shame; 
But in spite of it all we have struggled to learn 
That courage and wit are the same.

Care; 
For, at the best, this world is but a

We are tossed upon the sea of life, just like a

Where some get cast upon the rocks, and never get afloat ; 
But still we'll do the best we can, and never let despair 
Usurp the place between us and our castles in the air 
There's a 
name known o'er the world, to Englishmen mosi 
dear, 
And well may they be proud of him, their native bard, 
Shakespeare; 
When first his plays came on the stage, they made the whole 
world stare, 
And yet they were composed while building castles in the air. 
If you take the words of Shakespeare, and study them well 
through, 
You'll find each saying is so wise, each sentiment so true— 
They make you feel, while reading them, as if you had been 
there; 
Yet, the immortal Shakespeare built his castles in the air; 
The Irish had their poet, too; they loved him well, I'm sire; 
was a 
true born Irishman, his name was Thomas Moor% 
--aPe.mom

Of the troubles of this world, we know he had his share, 
But Moore was always happy, building: .:>istles in the air. 
He sang the rights of Ireland, lie sang agaInst her wrongs, 
And many a 
patient heart still cherishes his songs ; 
He bade the Irish heart rejoice, and never mere despair, 
And for Ireland in the future built bright castles in the air I 
And yet there is another name, to Scotchmen dearer still, 
And through each true Scottish heart ' twill make the blood te 
thrill ; 
His name was Robert Burns: yet he, too, had his care, 
When but a 
simple shepherd, building castles in the air. 
His home, a 
lowly ploughman's cot, where strife was never 
seen; 
For happy and contented lived Robert with his Jean; 
Down by the banks o' bonny Doon, near the town o' Ayr, 
Nature's poet, Bobby Burns, built castles in the air! 
And yet there is another name Americans adore, 
A 
statesman in the time of peace, a 
lion when in war ; 
With the storm on Bunker Hill, or on the Delaware, 
His genius made his soldiers build bright castles in the air. 
And, in his country's darkest hour, he bravely lead the van, 
And strived to make America the best of any land; 
Tho' he was not a 
poet born—he planned with skill and cesro„ 
The immortal Washington built castles in the air!,

Then each week in the night, each year in the month, 
It will snow, it will blow, or it will rain; 
While the rich is draining beer-kegs on some lonely srreet, 
While the poor man is drinking champagne. 
The poor go to Long Branch for the good of their )iraitlt 
The Herald and the Sun is the proof; 
They smoke i;',
'2.00 cigars, go in bathing in silks, 
While the rich have to sleep on the roof. 
Its a 
shame poor factory girls can't wear diamond ring: 
If she catches a 
mash at a 
ball, he is insane; 
He'll buy her a 
doughnut and a 
three cent lemonade, 
And imagine she is drinking-champagne. 
CHORUS: 
Then take my advice, sleep on a 
cake of ice, 
If you're got a 
bad reputation, rub out the stain; 
The Queen of Cincinnati has to drink milk, 
While Dennis Kearney is drinking champagne.

Take me Back to Home and Mother. 
Composed by WILLIAM A. HuNTLaY, and sung by • JaNrna 
Take me back to home and mother, 
I 
am weary wand'ring here, 
There can never be another 
Spot on earth so dear to me. 
Though I 
roam ' mid scenes of splendor, 
Yet my '- art is filled with pain, 
And a 
longing, sad and tender, 
Whispers take me back again. 
CHORUS. 
Take me back to home and mother, 
For my heart is filled with pain, 
Take me back to home and mother; 
Only take me back again. 
Take me back to home and mother, 
To the happy scenes of yore, 
Friends of childhood, sister, brother, 
Long to welcome me once more. 
I 
can hear their voices ringing, 
In sweet memory's refrain, 
To the past my heart is clinging, 
Only take me back again. 
Take me back, &c. 
Take me back to home and mother, 
Gentle words will greet me there, 
For on earth there is no other 
Kindness like a 
mother's care. 
Life is but a 
dream of pleasure, 
Sweetest hours must turn to pain, 
Home is all I 
have to treasure, 
Only take me home again. 
Take me back, &a.

LOCK OF MY MOTHER'S HAIR. 
Words by FRANK DUMONT. 
Music by EDDIE Fox 
Sung with great success by EVA BENNETIL 
I've a 
letter that was written long ago; 
'Tis a 
letter that I've treasured many years; 
Oh, how often I 
have read those fading lines, 
And over them there's traces of my tears; 
She sent to me her blessiscr in that missive, 
To see me was her constant prayer; 
The little lock of gray in this old letter, 
Is sleek of my angel mother's hair. 
CHORUS. 
I've a 
letter that was sent me long ago, 
A 
letter that I 
keep with tender care; 
The little lock of gray in this old letter, 
Is a 
lock at my angel mother's hair. 
I've a 
letter that was written long ago, 
That was sent to me across the stormy sea; 
When 'mong strangers I 
was wandering far away, 
And longing home again to ever be, 
But underneath the sod my mother's sleeping, 
She's free from earthly trials and its care; 
&toyer next my heart I'll keep herletterl 
Auld the lock of my angel mother's hair.

The Tables Turned. 
As told amid roars of laughter by DAx CouxElt, 
When I 
used to tend store in Baltimore, the old man came 
around one day, and says he: " Boys, the one that sells the 
most ' twixt now and Christmas, gets a 
vest pattern for a 
present." 
May be we didn't work for that vest pattern! I 
tell you there were some tall stories told in praise of goods 
just about that time ; but the tallest talker and the one that 
had more cheek than any of us, was a 
certain Jonah Squires, 
who roomed with me. 
He could take a 
dollar out of a 
man's 
pocket when the man only intended to spend a 
sixpence; 
and the women—Lord bless you !—they just handed over 
their pocket books to him and let him lay out what he liked 
for them. One night Jonah woke me up with, " By Jove, old 
fellow, if you think that ' ere's got any cotton in it, 
bring 
clown the sheep that it was cut from, and make him swear to 
his wool! ' Twon't wear out, neither; wore a 
pair of pants of 
that stuff for five years, and they are as good now as when I 
first put ' em on. 
Take it at thirty cents and I'll say you don't 
owe me anything. 
Eh! too dear? Well, call it twenty-eight 
cents. What d'ye say ? Shall I 
tear it ? All right, it's a 
bargain." 
I 
could feel Jonah's hand playing around the bed clothes for a 
minute, then rip ! tear! went something or other, and I 
hid 
my head under the blankets, perfectly convulsed with laughter, 
and sure that Jonah had torn the best sheet from top to bot-
tom. When I 
awoke next morning I 
found—alas! unkindest 
cut of all !—that the back of my night shirt was split from 
tail to collar-band. 
TONI BELL, in Dilk's bar room, fell out with Jack Hess, 
When Jack, who's a 
jovial elf, 
Anointed his brow with an axe that lay nesx. 
And promptly surrendered himself. 
As sung by En. BURTON. 
IT'S sailing I 
am at the dawn of the day 
To my brother that's over the sea, 
And it's little I 
care for my life anywhere 
For ' tis breaking my poor heart will be; 
But a 
treasure I 
take for old Ireland's sake, 
And I'll pledge all belonging above, 
'Tis a 
handful of turf from the land of me birth, 
From the heart of the country I 
love. 
(Repeat last two lines.) 
Then won't that poor lad in his exile be glad, 
When he sees the bright present I 
bring? 
And won't then the flowers in their elegant bowers 
Breathe forth the perfume of spring? 
Oh, Erin, Nlachree though it's parted we'll be, 
'Tis a 
blessing I 
leave on your shore, 
'lough sour mountains and streams I 
will see In 
my dreams, 
Till I 
cross to old Ireland once more.

A

as sung by FRANK LEWIS, 
at the Howard Athenteum, Boston, Mass. 
I 
HAVE sung of the minstrels who have all passed away, 
Whose names I 
love to recall, 
Of Bryant, Seymour and Unsworth, 
And Eph. Horn, the last of them all. 
But now as a 
token of sorrow I'll sing, 
Of our actors and actresses that are fled, 
Of the bright mimic heroes who have stood on thesa boards, 
But whose memory shall never be dead. 
CHORUS. 
Then success to the stage, and the people who win, 
Upon it a 
record and name, 
Who gain for themselves while our memory shall last, 
A 
seat in the temple of fame. 
There's an actress now gone to the land of the blest* 
The foot-lights will see her no more, 
As a 
true artist, she well stood the test, 
But the day of her triumph is o'er. 
Meg Merrilles now is a 
thing of the past, 
For the queen of the stage, she is gone, 
And none is left to wear the gold crown, 
Charlotte Cushman so often has worn.

Who stole my heart away. 
She looked at me, I 
looked at her, 
This charming gay quadroon; 
I 
said when I 
could catch my breath:

I

And at close by her side, - 
I

My own dear little bride. 
We are married now and settled down, 
And got a

And all this little rooster says is :

Three balls of gold that shine so bright, 
United by a

You would think that they were on fire.

Is there by niOtt and by day. 
When people comes in he gives them a

And this to them does say. 
What can I 
do for you to-day, 
Five dollars on a 
coat is that what you say 
A quarter I'll give you, I 
can't make it more.

Old pants, and coats and ulsters. too, 
And second hand clothes that never were new

think 4n

The day was warm and bright, 
Alv ulster did take into the guy, 
And asked for two cases as bright. 
When winter came I

For I 
was thinly clad, 
I 
had spent all my wealth for Santa Cruz rum, 
And hadn't a

With its emblem of gold so bright and so fair; 
We can go there no more, sleep on cellar doors, 
And manage to live upon air.

Except it pair of overalls, 
We'll always remember every cold Dezenabet,

American Fortune-Telling Cards.—This is the old- 
eat and most. widley known pack of Fortune-Telling Cards. We have 
published it for years, and the demand is continually increasing. SI 
These Cards are arranged and printed in series—Hearts, Clubs, Dia-' 
monds and Spades—and each of these into K for King, Q for Queen, 
and K for Knave, and numbers 1, 3, to 10. 
The Cards are arranged in 
four rows, and are to he read according to directions. Many of the an-
swers depend upon the position certain cards bear to other cards. The 
method of playing is somewhat complicated, but the directions have 
been made so that very little study will suffice to an ordinary under. 
standing. 
Many professional Eurtune-Tellers use these cards, and we 
are in receipt of letters in relation to them from all parts of the U. S. 
Enclosed in handsome case

Courting', Cards.—This Series of Cards has been arranged 
t 
meet a 
want frequently felt by young people—a 
want of means of 
expressinc, one's sentiments in such a 
way as to be non-committal. 
Many young ladies are visited by gentlemen who are either too dl. 
de 
-.
rAoo fearful of a 
repulse to venture upon asking the momentous 
tie 
qstion. The lady is restrained, by custom and a 
sense of propriety, 
from doing anything that would seem to be an unladylike encourage-
ment. As a 
result of this dilemma, many lives are spent as an unloved 
tedious existence, which might have been prolonged and enjoyed in the 
t 
happiness of matrimony. This pack of Cards will overcome the diffi-
culty, and being in the shape of questions and answers, will cover every 
phase of courtship. The sentiments conveyed therein need not be 
adopted by the parties to the game as their own, unless it accords with 
the state of their :Weer ions, which fact makes a 
further explanation un-
neces,zary. The playing of these Cards is not restricted to two players, 
but may be enjoyed by evening parties

-` A 
Little Book has lately appeared in print at Mr. A. J. FISHER'S, No. 24 
Vesey Street, called the 
Little Flirt." We cannot say that we recors, 
mend it to our young lady and gentlemen readers, as we think it would 
only encourage the bad habit of " flirting." 
Unfortunatly, thcre is 
enough of it done without any further necessity of explaining "how, 
when and where to do it," and this little volume would advise and initi-
ate the uncorrupted in practicing what is commonly called "flirting" 
The N. Y. Evening Telegram writes: " We have latoiv seen a 
neat little 
boo-K. bound in Morrocco leather, costing twenty-11 ,y, ..:ents, called the 
"Little Flirt." published by A. J. 
FISHER, N o. 24 ';', sey Street. 
It 
gives information of the modus operandi of flirting, and of the meaning 
of every motion of the handkerchief, fan, glove r.nd parasol. 
As there 
nothing at all objectionable in the volume, and its contents might 
afford some innocent amusement to many, we do not hesitate to recom. 
mend it to our yoang lady and gentlemen readers."
