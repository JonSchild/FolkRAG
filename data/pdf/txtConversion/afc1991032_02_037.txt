The next week we began fieldwork in earnest. On our way to
Mosquero we stopped in Wagon Mound to learn about the Bean Day
Festival, in order to understand how historical it was. On the
way out of town we stopped at the two cemetaries at the base of
the Wagon Mound — Santa Clara, the Catholic camposanto and the
other, Protestant cemetary. Then we drove to Mosquero to talk
with Erma Trujillo. We ended the day by visiting the Canyon, the

The next day I went down to the Canyon to take pictues of the

while Laurie and Carl covered the went down to the
Canyon with Marguerito Garcia later T hiked out to
the ruins of the church, a straight-naved structure facing east
with a trapezoidal sanctuary. It did not have a sacristy, as
many in do. The structure is currently a ruin, with no
roof but full standing masonry walls and two openings for windows
on the north and south sides. A camposanto surrounds the
church. After the visit to the Canyon anda brief talk with Andy

and Tony Trujille T returned home.

The principal in for this study is the vernacular archi

tecture of the Moequero area, in particular tl ales and stone
houses of the Canyon and the dugouts and stone houses of Black
Lake e jacales of the Canyon were standard jacal construc-

sharpenned at the top, which were placed upright in a treach in

vigas aid across these and latillas, mud and conetines
tar paper placed on top for a roof; then the outeide walls
were. plastered with mud. It should be noted here that the
finished jacales looked just like adobes when plastered, except
perhaps for the slight ripple in the surface of the walls
indicating the logs beneath. The atone houses in the Canyon were
similar in plan, but sometimes had symmetrical facades (door/win-
Jow/window/door or window/door/door/window) and often had stylish
masonry techniques (rusticated watertables with smooth, finished
surfaces above and beaded corners). Other aspects of structures

The structures of Black Lake offered another perspective: again,
the use of both dressed and undressed stone, the variation in
floor plan, and the use of the dugout form in the prairie
environment. As opposed to the closed-in, valley environnent of
the Canyon, Black Lake stands north of Mosquero on the flat or
gently rolling prairie characteristic of the High Plains.
Dugouts were rectangular in plan with a central riage pole and
pitched roof. Often what appeared to be the original dugout

This investigation leads to questions about ethnic difference in
regard to the architecture of the two settlements. It would be
necessary to go back and do measured drawings of more of the
