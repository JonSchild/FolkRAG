MR. AND MRS. HOWARD PAUL. 
tProm the London " Illustrated News.) 
NEARLY ten years ago, there appeared in the streets of Dublin 
a modest placard, announcing that on a 
certain date Mr. and 
Mrs. Howard Paul would appear for the first time, at the Rotun-
da, under the patronage of the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, in a 
new Musical, Comic, and Fanciful Entertainment. 
The " first 
night" duly arrived, the entertainment was given, Lord Carlisle 
and a 
brilliant suite were present, and the result was a 
great 
success. 
From that night up to the present time, in almost 
every quarter of Great Britain, (and on one occasion in France, 
before the Emperor Napoleon III. and the French Court,) Mr. and 
Mrs. Howard Paul have repeated their amusing entertainments 
with an éclat and profit almost unprecedented in the annals of 
popular amusements. 
Mr. Howard Paul, who writes his own libretto, is an American 
by birth, and debuted in London as a 
comic writer in 1856, in the 
then popular " Diogenes" ( which, for a time, successfully, ri-
valled Punch,) and to which he was attached till its close. 
He 
then produced, in conjunction with Mr. John Leech, who fur-
nished the engravings, a 
serial work, entitled " Dashes of Ameri-
can Humor," which achieved considerable popularity, and which 
was subsequently reprinted in the United States, where it met 
with success. Mr. Paul also published the first magazine devoted 
exclusively to American literature produced in England, and it 
was in its pages that Poe's celebrated " Raven " and the " Has" 
were first introduced to British readers. 
Mr. Paul has, wr.itten 
various pieces of a 
light character for the stage, the. most $ug-
cessful of which was a 
skit on the table-turning excitement of 
seven years ago, and which was produced at the Haymarket 
with Mr. Buckstone as the rapping hero.

MR. AND MRS. HOWARD PAUL.

Married," also made a 
good impression at the Princess's, and 
several capital vaudevilles at the Lyceum and Strand were re-
ceived with favor. 
Mr. Howard Paul made his clbut on the 
stage at Bath in 1654, in a 
musical vaudeville, written by himself, 
called " My Neighbor Opposite." 
It was highly successful, and 
the veteran T. P. Cooke, who happened to be in the theatre on 
the occasion, complimented the author-actor as having made the 
" 
most self-possessed and least conventional first appearance he 
had ever witnessed." 
Mrs. Howard Paul, who won dramatic laurels before her mar-
riage as Miss Featherstone, is undeniably one of the most popu-
lar vocalists and actresses on the English Stage. A portion of 
her musical education having been received in France and Italy, 
the foundation of a 
correct style and method was laid, which has 
been of enduring service to the fair artiste. 
Her voice, which is 
a 
pure contralto, ranges front A in the bass clef to A in alt—a 
compass of precisely three octaves—the lower portion of which is 
singularly rich and powerful in quality. 
It possesses what) is 
called " timbre " to a 
wonderful extent, more so than any En-
glish contralto voice which we can think of at this moment. The 
great charm of Mrs. Howard Paul's manner on the stage is its 
naturalness; she looks, moves, and speaks with a 
well-controlled 
impulsiveness, as different as can be conceived from the custom-
ary rant and cant, the hack conventionality of the stage. 
Her 
utterance is singularly distinct. 
There is an ease, too, and 
espieglerie about her style that invariably finds friends, and in 
assumptions where dialect ( the Irish or Scotch, for example) is 
required, she is incomparable. 
Her figure is tall, slight, and 
well-proportioned. 
Der face is a 
remarkably fine one, and of a 
character well adapted for the stage. 
It is a 
curious coincidence 
that Madame Dejazet, one of the most popular of Parisian act-
resses, of the same order of versatile talent as Mrs. Howard Paul, 
has a 
similar face, although the French lady is a 
veteran. 
The 
eyes are large, brilliant, and expressive. 
The nose is just suffi-
ciently retrousse to impart piquancy to the face. 
The mouth is 
large, with brilliant, even teeth, and flexible lips capable of the 
most instantaneous and effective variations of expression. 
In 
short, her face is one of those on which animation and dramatic 
expression sit " with most excellent grace." 
As an actor and mimic, Mr. Howard Paul hits off his charac-
ters with a ready liveliness and ease of manlier that at once 
places hint on good terms with his audience. 
He possesses the 
valuable faculty of a 
comedian—the power of exciting mirth by 
a 
spontaneous word and whimsical play of feature—a 
most desir-
able quality in a 
comic artiste. 
In a 
class of airy, volatile char-
acters, such as " The Man who Knows Everybody,” Mr. Howard 
Paul is especially flexible and fluent ; and if he were to devote 
himself to this species of role, now that Mr. Charles Matthews is 
rapidly passing the " sentimental age" we have no doubt he 
would most ably supply the absence of that brilliant comedian. 
In the art of " making up," too, Mr. Paul gives evidences 
of good study. 
He comprehends to a nicety the use of a 
hare's-foot and camel-hair pencil. 
The crow's-feet and wrinkles 
in his assumption of " Old Roger Whitelock " are irreproachable, 
and the face of " Willie Spoonleigh, the lady-like young man," 
has a plumpness of outline and radiance of complexion that 
offers a blooming contrast to the shrivelled octogenarian that 
follows closely upon it. 
We have not space to follow the pro-
gramme of Mr. Howard Paul's impersonations. 
Suffice it to 
say that they are all individualized, consistent, and extremely 
amusing. 
Of Mrs. Howard Paul's characters, all are excellent, but two 
may fairly claim the distinction of being great creations. " Molly 
Doolan, the Irish Nurse," is a 
wonderful bit of fidelity in art. 
The Dublin press unanimously pronounced it the " best, because 
the truest, impersonation of an Irish girl ever given on the stage 
—a very great compliment, when it is remembered that scores of 
actresses have attempted tile delineation of Irish character. 
The 
other creation to which we allnde is the " Unprotected Female," a 
whimsical picture, highly colored, of an angular, " learned-igno-
rant " old maid, who rehearses the various attacks made upon 
her heart, and afterwards sings a 
capital song anent the troubles 
and hardships that a 
poor lone female must endure. 
There are 
minute observations and delicate touches in this assumption 
which ptace Mrs. Howard Paul at the very head of eccentric 
actresses. 
Mr. Charles Dickens once complimented this impel., 
sonation as a " wonderfully clever bit of acting." 
Of the famous " living photograph of Mr. Sims Reeves," it is 
unnecessary to say more than that it is an astonishing repro-
duction, without caricature, of the great tenor's manner, style, 
voice, and appearance. 
Of its effect upon a 
stranger, tile follow-
ing anecdote will serve to show. Among the audience on one 
occasion, at the St. James's Dan, was a 
Russian nobleman, who 
had never before visited the English metropolis. 
On the conclu-
sion of " Come into the Garden Maud," sung to perfection by 
Mrs. Howard Paul, the Russian applauded vehemently, and ex-
pressed a 
desire to his friend and cicerone (au Englishman,) to 
be presented to the exquisite tenor. 
His friend at once assured 
him that it was not a 
tenor, but a 
lady lie had just heard. " Im-
possible !" said the Russian ; " This is mere badinage. I 
am not 
so great a 
stranger in England, that I 
am to be told. English la-
dies possess tenor voices." " But I 
assure you," pursued the 
Englishman, " it is no device of mine, but a 
singular truth—that 
was the voice of a 
lady, and a 
wonderful imitation of Mr. Reeves, 
our first English tenor." 
In spite of this assurance the Russian 
was incredulous. 
Ile shook his head doubtingly. " My friend," 
said he, " I 
have no doubt you believe it to be a 
lady, but there 
is some trick, some artifice here beyond your comprehension. 
No woman living could mimic the notes and intonation of a 
man 
so closely. 
Depend upon it you are the dupe." 
It was in vain 
4 
3111. AND AIRS. HOWARD PAUL. 
the Englishman protested that he was correct. 
His noble friend 
grew excited. " Sir," said he, with emphasis, " 
wager you 
£100 that it was not a 
lady who sung. 
Do you take me for an 
imbecile, that I 
can't distinguish a 
female, even if she be dis-
guised ?" The wager was then and there agreed upon. 
At the 
end of the evening the whole party waited to see the heroine of 
the entertainment in propria persona: and it was not until the 
Russian hail heard Mrs. 
Paul, attired as. a lady, sing the 
same song, that he would believe it was not a 
gentleman he had 
listened to only an hour before. 
Of course the Englishman won 
the £100, and at once signified his intention of bestowing it on a 
charity. 
As the group left the room, the Russian cast a glance 
back at Mrs. Howard Paul, and addressed his friend with a 
puz-
zled air :—Ma foil are you quite sure this is a 
lady, and not a 
gentleman in crinoline, got up to play a trick on me?" Mrs. 
Howard Paul caught the last words, and instantly sat down at 
the piano, and sang a 
Russian Troika song in her natural voice. 
This at once completed the little comedy. 
All suspicion at once 
vanished, and the group departed with the notion that Mrs. 
Howard Paul is not only an admirable mimic, but that English 
tact and dramatic skill are found to baffle the eyes and ears of 
wondering Russians. 
MR. AND MRS. HOWARD PAUL'S 
SONGS. 
THE DREAM OF THE REVELLER .* 
Re-written by M R. HENRY RUSSELL for M RS. IIOWARD PAUL. 
AROUND the board the guests were met, the lights above 
them gleaming, 
And in their cups, repleuish'd oft, the ruddy wine was 
streaming ; 
Their cheeks were flush'd, their eyes were bright, their 
hearts with pleasure bounded, 
The song was sung, the toast was given, and loud the 
revel sounded; 
I 
drain'd my bumper with the rest, and cried " Away 
with sorrow! 
Let me be happy for to-day, and care not for to-
morrow!" 
But as I 
spoke my sight grew dim, and slumber deep 
came o'er me, 
And 'mid the whirl of mingling tongues, this vision 
pass'd before me.

TIM DREAM OF THE nEwr.r.,Lrai. 
Methought I saw a 
demon rise; he held a mighty 
beaker, 
Whose burnish'd sides ran daily o'er with floods of 
burning liquor ; 
Around him press'd a clam'rous crowd, to taste this 
liquor greedy, 
But chiefly came the poor and sad, the suff"ring and 
the needy; 
All those oppress'd by grief and debts, the dissolute 
and lazy, 
Blear-eyed old men, and reckless youths, and palsied 
women crazy. 
" 
Give, give!" they cry, " Give, give us drink, to drown 
all thoughts of sorrow, 
If we are happy for to-day,- we care not for to-morrow!" 
The first drop warms their shiv'ring skins, and drives 
away their sadness, 
The second lights their sunken eyes, and fills their 
souls with gladness ; 
The third drop makes them shout and rave, and play 
each furious antic ; 
The fourth drop boils their very blood, the fifth drop 
drives them frantic. 
" 
Drink!" says the demon, " Drink your fill! drink of 
these waters mellow, 
They'll make your bright eyes blear and dull, and turn 
your white skins yellow ; 
They'll fill your homes with care and grief, and clothe 
your backs with tatters, 
They'll fill your hearts with evil thoughts, but never 
mind,—what matters ? 
"Though virtue sink and reason fail, and social ties 
dissever, 
I'll be your friend in hour of need, and find you homes 
forever ; 
For I 
have built three mansions high, three strong and 
goodly houses, 
  LIFE OF JULIUS CinSAR. 
11 
A 
workhouse for the jolly soul, who all his life carouses; 
An hospital to lodge the sot, oppress'd by pain and 
anguish, 
A prison full of dungeons deep, where hopeless felons 
languish. 
So drain the cup, and drink again, and drown all 
thoughts of sorrow, 
Be happy if you can to-day, and never mind to-
morrow!" 
But well he knows, this demon old, how vain is all his 
preaching, 
The ragged crew that round him flock are heedless of 
his teaching: 
Even as they hear his fearful words, they cry with 
shouts of laughter, 
" 
Out on the fool who maws to-day with thoughts of a 
hereafter, 
We care not for thy houses three, we live but for the 
present, 
And merry we will make it yet, and quaff our bumpers 
pleasant." 
Loud laughs the fiend to hear them speak, and lifts his 
brimming beaker, 
" 
Body and soul are mine," quotb. he, " I'll have them 
both for liquor."

THE LIFE or TU/XCTS C.2ESAR. 
So I've laid my sword upon the shelf and taken up my 
pen, 
Just to show that even Emperors can be useful now and 
then. 
Friends, countrymen, and lovers, will you kindly lend 
an ear, 
To a 
little ancient history, describing the career 
Of the late lamented Csar, who, I 
think you'll all 
agree, 
Was exactly like my uncle, who was very much like me. 
AIR—" Home, Sweet Home." 
Of all romantic capitals, abroad or at home, 
For deep classic interest there's no place like Rome; 
'Twas there, two thousand years ago, as all the school-
books say, 
The subject of this brief memoir first saw the light of 
day. 
Ant—"Pachile your own Canoe." 
He travelled about in various parts, of adventures he 
saw a 
few, 
And, self-reliant, quite early he learned to paddle his 
own canoe; 
His wants were small, he cared not at all, if his debts 
were discharged when due; 
And if history ain't trash, he always paid cash, and ne'er 
gave an I 
0 
U. 
Then he joined the army, and soon arose to command 
the forces too,. 
And DOW, launched well on the ocean of life, he paddled 
his own canoe. 
AIR—" The Tight Little Island." 
He thought it exciting to go in for fighting, 
And after some battles on dry land, 
To Britain sailed over, and landing at Dover, 
Walk'd into that tight little island. 
TH_

" 
This snug little, tight little island, 
In future ( said he) shall be my land, 
Tho' the Pict and the Scot went Scot-free till I 
got 
These pict men of my own on the island. 
AIR—" The Rateateher's Daughter." 
But while he worried those Picts and Scots, and was 
putting them all to slaughter, 
His foes were busily hatching plots on the other side of 
the water; 
But when Ceesar return'd, poor Pompey learn'd the 
folly of turning traitor, 
For he and his friends came to very bad ends, while 
CTsar became Dictator. 
AIR—" One Bumper at Parting." 
Now a 
certain young person called Brutus 
Observ'd to a 
crony one day, 
" 
This is hardly the right man to suit us, 
So let's put him out of the way." 
His friend, whose cognomen was Cassius, 
Replied (very shrewdly indeed:) 
" 
But Cmsar will certainly smash us 
Supposing we shouldn't succeed," 
Now Brutus, as history mentions, 
Was Cresar's " particular friend," 
So his rather unfriendly intentions 
One cannot at all comprehend! 
Ant--" The Death of Nelson." 
'Twas on the fifteenth day of March they found a 
way 
To put their plans in force. 
They ran our hero thro', a 
dozen times or two, 
Which did for him, of course! 
And so this high and mighty swell 
As dead as Julius Csar fell, 
Exclaiming et tu Brute: 
'Twas quite in vain police to shout, for as police weren't 
yet found out, 
That day they were not on duty! —( Repeat. ) 
BOWLD SOJER BOY. 
Sung by M RS. HOWARD PAUL in the character of " Molly Doolan,' 9 
the Irish Nurse. 
On! there's not a 
trade that's going, worth showing or 
knowing 
Like that from glory growing for a 
bowlel sojer boy— 
Where right or left ye go, share ye know, friend or foe 
Will have the hand or toe from the bowld sojer boy. 
There's not a 
town we march through 
But ladies looking arch through 
The window panes, will sarch through 
The ranks to find their joy; 
While up the street, each girl you meet, 
Will look so sly, and cry " My eye! 
Och! isn't he a 
darlint ? the bowld sojer boy !" 
But when we get the rout, how they pout, and they 
shout, 
While to the right-about goes the bowld sojer boy; 
'Tis then that ladies fair, in despair, tear their hair, 
But the deuce a 
one I 
care, says the bowld sojer boy. 
For the world is all before us, 
Where landladies adore us, 
And ne'er refuse to score us, 
But chalk us up with joy— 
We taste her tap, we tear her cap! 
" 
Oh, that's the chap for me," says she, 
" 
Och! isn't he the darlint?" says the bowld sojer boy. 
[Mr. Samuel Lover, the distinguished poet and novelist, htz 
kindly written for Mrs. Howard Paul the following encore 
verses.] 
But now the volunteers greet out ears with their cheers, 
And men of sober years turn to bowld sojer boys. 
The school-boy scorns his play and will pray for the 
day 
When old enough, he may join the bawld-sojers boys. 
And girls in every parish, 
When now they're asked in marriage, 
Disdaining clownish carriage, 
The hope of louts destroy ; 
They say, " Go drill, and march, until 
With gallant step you learn to leap 
Into a 
woman's heart, like a 
bowld sojer boy!" 
'Tis fine! when on parade, by some maid of high grade, 
A 
handsome present's made to the bowld sojer boys; 
Some silver trump, whose sound ringing round guarded 
ground, 
Makes the gallant spirit bound of the bowld sojer boys! 
And when at target practice, 
The levelled rifle cracked is, 
Of triumph then no lack 'tis 
For marksmen in their joys ;— 
'Tis not bull's-eyes alone they prize, 
But blue eyes bright, that shed their light 
Upon the rifle prizemen of the bowld sojer boys! 
WHEN GEORGE THE THIRD WAS KING. 
Sung by M R. HowARD PAUL in his representation of " ow Roger 
Whiteloc k." 
TIMES indeed do greatly change in a 
lapse of threescore 
years; 
Everything seems new and strange, even language that 
one hears! 
Dress and manners lately learned, sheer dismay to all 
must bring ; 
Upside down the world has turned since George the 
Third was King, 
Hearts n.e'er change, and still we'll sing, 
Tra, in, la, la, In, etc. 
As when George the Third was King! 
Tra, in, In, in, la, etc.

Wives are now,so very dear—husbands are becoming 
rare; 
Twice five hundied pounds a-year will scarce support a 
married pair! 
Even then colmibial loves, judging what Divorce Courts 
bring, 
Ain't so much like turtle-doves; as when George the 
Third was King! 
Tra, In, la, la, la, etc. 
Fain we'd watch, with joy serene, sportive childhood's 
gay delight ; 
Nowhere can a 
child be seen ; they've gone out of fash-
ion, quite! 
Girls are women, now at ten—airs and graces—every-
thing; 
Little boys are all young men—what a 
change since 
George was King! 
Tra, la, la, la, la, etc. 
No respect is shown to age—" ancient fogies" we are 
called ; 
Slang expressions, now the rage, make one's senses feel 
appalled! 
To old customs, for their sakes, saints forbid that we 
should cling; 
Yet we might a 
lesson take, from the days when George 
was King! 
Tra, la, la, la, la, etc. 
THE SHIP ON FIRE, 
The Music by M IL HENRI- Russm„ and sung by M RS. HOWARD 
PAUL. 
THE Storm o'er the ocean flew furious and fast, 
And the waves rose in foam at the voice of the blast; 
And heavily labored the gale-beaten ship, 
Like a 
stout-hearted swimmer, the spray at his lip ; 
And dark was the sky o'er the mariner's path, 
Except when the lightning illumed it in wrath. 
THE SHIP ON ITEM. 
17 
A 
young mother knelt in the cabin below, 
And, pressing her babe to her bosom of snow, 
She prayed to her God, 'mid the hurricane wild, 
" 
Oh, Father of mercy, look down on my child!" 
It passed; the fierce whirlwind careered on its way, 
And the ship like an arrow divided the spray; 
Her sails glimmered white in the beams of the moon, 
And the breeze up aloft seemed to whistle a 
tune. 
There was joy in the ship as she furrowed the foam, 
For fond hearts within her were dreaming of home. 
The young mother pressed her fond babe to her breast, 
And sang a 
sweet song as she rocked it to rest, 
And the husband sat cheerily down by her side, 
And looked with delight on the face of his bride ; 
" 
Oh, happy," said he ; " when our roaming is o'er, 
We'll dwell in our cottage that stands by the shore,— 
Already in fancy its roof I 
descry, 
And the smoke of its hearth curling up to the sky ; 
The garden so green, with its vine-covered wall, 
And kind friends awaiting to welcome us all, 
And the children that sport by the old oaken tree." 
Ah! gently the ship glides over the sea; 
But hark! what was that? hark to the shout, " Fire!" 
Then a 
tramp and a 
rout, and an uproar of voices arose 
in the air! 
And the mother knelt down, and the half-spoken prayer 
That she offered to God in her agony wild 
Was " Father, have mercy; look down on my child!" 
She flew to her husband, she clung to his side, 
Oh there was a 
refuge whate'er might betide! 
Fire! it was raging above and below, 
And the cheeks of the sailors grew pale at the sight, 
And their eyes glistened wild in the glare of the light, 
'Twas vain o'er the ravage the waters to drip, 
The pitiless flame was the lord of the ship : 
The smoke in thick wreaths mounted higher and 
higher; 
Oh God, it is fearful to perish by fire! 
Alone with destruction, alone on the sea, 
18 
I'm A T‘i, 
Great Father of merey, our hope is in Thee! 
Sad at heart and resigned, yet undaunted and brave, 
They lowered the boat—a 
mere speck on the wave: 
First entered the mother, enfolding her child— 
It knew she caressed it, looked upward and smiled. 
Cold, cold was the night as they drifted away, 
And mistily dawned o'er the pathway the day ; 
And they prayed for the light, and at noontide, about, 
The sun o'er the waters shone joyously out. 
" 
Sail ho! Sail ho!" cried the man at the lee ; 
"Ho, a 
sail!" and they turned their glad eyes o'er the 
sea ; 
" 
They see us! they see us! the signal is waved ; 
They bear down upon ns; thank God, we are saved!"

IN

That folks got taking me

It puzzled all our kith

For one of us was born

fearful 
a 
twin, and not a

One day ( to make the matter worse, ) before our names 
were fixed, 
As we were being washed by nurse, we got completely 
'mixed; 
And thus you see, by fate's decree (or rather nurse's 
whim,) 
My brother John got christened me, and I 
got christened 
him!

This fatal likeness even dogged my footsteps when at 
school; 
And I 
was always getting flogged, for John turned out 
a 
fool. 
I 
put this question fruitlessly to every one I 
knew, 
What would you do if you were me, to prove that you 
were you ? 
Our close resemblance turned the tide of my domestic 
life, 
For, somehow, my intended bride became my brother's 
wife. 
In fact, 
year after year, the same absurd mistakes 
went on, 
And when I 
died, the neighbors came and buried 
brother John.

For as such I'll not behave.

Goodness, gracious, what a

Mrs. D. 
Yes, 'tis me that's all to blame ! 
Well, 'tis 
woman's lot to bear. 
Mr. D. 
What the dickens—

Sir, for shame—rave, abuse, but do not

You must know I'm far from strong; spare

Blissful thought, what happiness!

TEM STAB SPANGLED BANNER. 
Whose broad stripes and bright stars in the perilous 
fight, 
O'er the ramparts we watched, were so gallantly stream-
ing; 
and the rockets' red glare, the bombs bursting in air, 
Gave proof through the night that our flag was still 
there. 
Oh, say, does that star-spangled banner yet wave 
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave? 
And where is the band that so vauntingly swore 
That the havoc of war and the battle's confusion 
A 
home and a 
country should leave us no more ? 
Their blood has washed out their foul footsteps' pollu-
tion. 
No refuge could save the hireling and slave 
From the terror of flight and the gloom of the grave; 
And the star-spangled banner in triumph doth wave, 
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave 
Oh! thus be it ever when freemen shall stand 
Between their loved homes and the war's desolation. 
Blest with victory and peace, may the heav'n-rescued 
land 
Praise the power that hath made and preserved us a 
nation! 
Then conquer we must, when our cause it is just, 
And this be our motto, "IN 
GOD IS OUR TRUST." 
And the star-spangled banner in triumph shall wave 
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave. 
occasion, in 1864, an &mute occurred in Hull, when Mrs. Howard 
Paul sang it through storms of mingled applause and hisses. 
In 
London and the Lancashire districts it was invariably received 
with enthusiasm. 
In point of fact, the opposition grew more 
and more feeble as the war progressed. 
Mrs. Howard Paul must 
have made the melody of the " Banner if familiar to tells of 
thousands of English people. 
TrEc soratows AND THE HARDSHIPS, ETC. 25 
THE SORROWS AND THE HARDSHIPS POOR FEMALES 
MUST ENDURE. 
Sung by MRS. HowAnn PAUL in the character of " Miss Selina 
Singleheart, 77 a 
playful young virgin of forty-seven summers. 
On, it's really shameful! 'tis most scandalous! 
The sorrows and hardships poor females must endure, 
If a woman is but single, and has lived some forty 
years, 
The world henceforth, for her, poor thing, is but a 
vale 
of tears! 
And the sooner that she quits it,--why the better 'twill 
befall, 
For she's pushed about, insulted, and imposed upon by 
Oh, it's really shameful! 'tis most scandalous, 
The sorrows and hardships poor females must endure. 
Those dreadful cabmen! swear, swear, grumbling! 
They never think of charging less than eighteenpence a 
mile; 
And when, all in a 
flurry, at the door they set you down, 
You get a 
leaden shilling 
exchange for half-a-crown. 
Or, if you hail an omnibus, conductors will deride, 
With " Very sorry, ma'am, we're full—but won't you go 
outside ?' 
Oh, it's really shameful, etc. 
If you venture out a 
shopping, fraud, fraud, inso-
lence! 
You're forced to buy a 
lot trash which ain't of the slight-
est use : 
They know you're unprotected, so your patience, is 
abused, 
With—" what is the next article?" until you're quite 
confused, 
They play off rude unfeeling jokes, and ask permission 
p'raps, 
To try you on that crinoline 1 
or show you babies' caps! 
Oh, it's really shameful, etc. 
26 
TO ROUE OR TO DEATH. 
If I 
were the Queen, or had a 
seat in Parliament, 
I 
know I'd contrive to stop such goings on: 
I'd force all men to marry, or a 
staff I'd organize, 
Of government inspectors these fellows to chastise; 
"Who, when females ventured in the streets, should fol-
low at their backs, 
And, to pay- the cost—on bachelors, rd layr a 
heavy tax. 
Oh, it's really shameful, etc. 
TO ROME OR TO DEATH. , 
Sung by M RS. HOWARD PAUL, in her marvelous impersernaticrn of 
"Gen. Garibaldi." 
To arms! 
To arms! 
Fair land of sweet music, of beauty and flowers, 
Be still, as thou hast been, the land of the brave and 
the free. 
With hundreds of chains they have fettered thy powers, 
But still through our country we'll shout, " Liberty!" 
Oh, haste then, oh, haste then, brave comrades, to 
form. 
To the winds are our banners unfurled and high stream-
ing. 
There with our steels clashing bright, 
There with our eyes flashing light, 
The fire of dear Italy in our hearts gleaming. 
To Rome or to Death! 
We'll drive out the tyrant. 
Evviva Garibaldi! 
Mute are the lips, but the strong arm is ready; 
The foe shall soon know that our right is our might! 
And soon o'er our mountains shall tyrants be driven— 
For one heart, one soul shall Italians unite, 
We seek not the triumph of barbarous plunder, 
We ask from the spoiler the land of our birth; 
The people of Italy must be united, 
BRIGHT CHANTICLEER. 
27 
The hundred old cities must be one on the earth. 
To Rome or to Death! 
We'll drive out the tyrant. 
Evviva Garibaldi 1 
Our dear homes were made for Italians alone, 
Over the Danube are your lands ; then leaves us 
In peace, as ye found us; our bread ye have stolen, 
Even of our sons ye have tried to bereave us. 
The Austrian badge shall not sully our banners, 
The children of Rome shall not bend to a 
foreign sway, 
In slavery too long they have borne with the stranger, 
But now these proud Legions we'll scatter away! 
To Rome or to Death! 
We'll drive out the tyrant. 
Evviva Garibaldi! 
Extract from a 
letter, dated Como, June 17th, which appeared 
in the London " Daily Telegraph." 
" 
A thousand times must it have been remarked in print that 
the aspect of Garibaldi is as that of a 
lion. 
But no other simile 
will serve. 
Sorriso de madre, riguardo di leone,7 the Italians 
say of him. Ms port and mien are, 
of a 
truth, thoroughly 
leonine: but the 
sorriso Ce madre, , the ' mother's smile,' 
comes over him when he converses familiarly, when he calls to 
some member of his staff, or best of all, when he sees the boy 
volunteers, the hope and promise of Italy, passing before him. 
And there surely was never a 
countenance so thoroughly trans-
lucent, and from whose eyes there beamed so strongly the light 
of the soul within—the soul of a 
just and upright man, quietly 
striving to do his duty. I 
think Diogenes, coming into his pres-
ence, might have pitched his lantern out of the window, and, sit-
ting down on his tub, have cried, 
Here he is at last.' 
I 
think 
the most devoted student of Scottish heraldry and the firmest 
believer in the chivalric supremacy of 
Sir David Lindsay of the 
Mount,' might have admitted that this was, after all, the real 
old tawny ' Lord Lyon, king of arms,' and king of men, too ; for 
there is witchery in his glance, and magic in his smile."

A SONG ABOUT PAPER. 
The lowing herds now quit the lawn, 
The lark springs from the corn. 
Dogs, huntsmen round the window throng, 
Fleet Towler leads the cry, 
Arise the burthen of their song, 
This day a 
stag must die. 
With a 
hey, ho, Chivey, 
Hark forward Tantivy. 
The cordial takes it merry round, 
The laugh and joke prevail; 
The huntsman blows a 
jovial sound, 
The dogs snuff up the gale. 
The uplands winds they sweep along, 
O'er fields, through brakes they fly; 
The game is roused, too true the song, 
This day a 
stag must die. 
With a 
hey, ho, etc., etc. 
A 
SONG ABOUT PAPER. 
Sung by Ma. IITIWARD PAUL. 
Or " Golden Age" do poets tell, the " Age of Brass' 
they laud as well ; 
While every age hath served by times a 
peg on which 
to hang their rhymes. 
But as the world goes rolling on, strange times, indeed, 
we've chanced upon; 
For Fashion's progress never lags, and now we're in the 
" 
Age of Rags !"— 
For paper now is all the rage, and nothing else will 
suit the age. 
Each swell, attired in mode extreme, of paper is a 
walk-
ing ream; 
His collar, necktie, shirt, and vest, instead of starched 
are all hot-pressed. 
A SONG ABOUT PAPER. 
29 
But, greatest care he's forced to own—being held to-
gether by paste alone; 
And should he sneeze, or start, or spring, 'twould really 
be a 
dreadful thing!— 
. 
For paper now is all the rage, and nothing else will 
suit the age. 
The ladies meet our stricken gaze, all papered round 
like fresh bouquets ; 
And thus attired they roam the streets, mere paper par-
cels—filled with sweets. 
But on them should a 
rain-drop fall, to grief they'd 
come, aye, each and all; 
For, if their dresses once they splash, there'd nought 
remain but paper mash! 
For paper now is all the rage, and nothing else will 
suit the age. 
The children soon, we may suppose, will run about in 
paper clothes ; 
With sealing wax each tear we'll bind, then give them 
whacks of different kind. 
To keep them clean no soap we'll need, for India-rub-
ber will do instead; 
But pinafores, ' tis greatly feared, will at the corners get 
dog's-ears !— 
For paper now is all the rage, and nothing else will 
suit the age. 
In every shop one now espies the " last new thing" in 
paper ties ; 
The coats of " best blue wove" are made, but shirts, of 
course, are all " cream-laid." 
A 
paper hat should you desire, or paper socks—say half 
a 
quire— 
Or " peg-tops" of the best design, you'll get them all 
for three-and-nine !— 
For paper now is all the rage, and nothing else will 
suit the age. 
LA MARSEILLALSE. 
'Tis hard to say where this will stop ; each tailor soon 
must shut up shop: 
And every laundress, do not doubt, ere long will fairly 
be washed out ; 
For we shall see, '
midst other rigs, old maids decked 
out with paper wigs, 
Our shops unfurling paper sails, and tom-cats sporting 
paper tails— 
Before the world has lost its rage—to celebrate the 
Paper Age. 
LA MARSEILLAISE, 
(rnrxcu.) 
Sang by Mils. RowAnn PAUL, after the manner of Madame 
Rachel. 
M. Lockroy, a 
French writer, thus describes the cir-
cumstances of Madle. Rachel's singing this lyric:— 
" 
One evening I 
was in Rachel's box, when she suddenly 
said: 
have dreamed of something extraordinary, 
which will draw all Paris. 
I 
will sing the Marseillaise: 
But I 
did not know you could sing. ' No matter—I 
will 
make a 
mdlopde of it. 
You shall come and hear it to-
night—there will only be three or four of you present.' 
Then I 
am to announce that Madle. Rachel will sing the 
Marseillaise, at the Thdiltre Francaise? ' Certainly_ 
don't you think it will bring in money at a 
period when 
th6 theatres are deserted ?' 
That depends—I 
must hear 
it first.—In short, when the performance was over we 
assembled in the green-room. With her family collected 
around her, and the tricolor flag in her hand, she at-
tacked the celebrated song, which she had stealthily 
studied, verse by verse, note by note. 
It was not sing-
ing, properly so called, but a 
recitation in which the 
LA MARSEILLAIsE.

strength ocaccentuation and the power of expression 
supplied the want of melody. 
It made the hearers 
tremble and shudder. 
The success was as great as the 
conception was daring. 
The Marseillaise brought in as 
much money as an entire tragedy."

THE MARBEILLAISE. 
(ENGLISH.) 
Translated by ionN OxENFoRD, EsQ. 
COME, children of your country, come, 
New glory dawns upon the world, 
Our tyrants rushing to their doom, 
Their crimson standard have unfurled. 
Already on our plains we hear 
The murmurs of a 
savage horde, 
They threaten with a 
murderous sword, 
Your comrades and children clear. 
Then up and form your ranks, the hireling foe 
withstand! 
March on, his craven blood must fertilize the land. 
Then tremble, tyrants,—traitors all— 
Ye, whom both friends and foes despise; 
On you shall retribution fall, 
Your crimes shall gain a 
worthy prize. 
Each man opposes might to might: 
And when our youthful heroes die, 
Our France can well their place supply; 
We're soldiers all with you to fight, 
Then up, and form your ranks, etc. 
Come, love of country, guide us now, 
Endow our vengeful arms with might, 
And, clearest Liberty, do thou 
Aid thy defenders in the fight. 
Unto thy flags let victory, 
Called by thy stirring accents, haste; 
And may thy dying foes at last 
Thy triumph and our glory see. 
Then up, and form your ranks, etc.

THE RED PETTICOAT. 
Sung by MR. HOWARD PAUL. 
ONE Leap Year, when Cupid was quite at a 
stand, 
With so many maidens remaining on hand— 
34 
RINGLE TINGLE, TRINICLE TRANI-MP, ETC. 
He charged every fair one her case to denote 
By wearing a 
gay-colored red petticoat; 
That lovers might see her affections were free, 
And just take a 
hint—from the red petticoat. 
This plan; 'twould appear, met with so much success, 
The girls in delight are adopting the dress; 
And, all years alike, their attractions promote 
By a 
lavish display of the red petticoat. 
The numbers you meet, as you walk in the street, 
Quite dazzle your eyes with the red petticoat. 
Now when with the steel hoops the fair owners expand, 
Their dresses looped up in festoons—this is grand! 
They seem not to walk— they majesticly float 
Like swans, on an ocean of red petticoat. 
There's nothing, I 
ween, like large crinoline 
To show to advantage the red petticoat. 
In truth its bright hue doth the charms so advance, 
No maid, howe'er old, but has now a 
fair chance ; 
And each who herself would to Hymen devote, 
Had best go and purchase a 
red petticoat, 
And lovers ' twill bring—for the daintiest thing 
E'er fashion devised is the red petticoat. 
RINGLE JINGLE, TRINKLE TRANKLE, OFF WI, GO. 
Sleighing song, sung by M R. HOWARD PAUL, as the " American 
Major Greenbacks.” 
PEGGY, dear, the sleigh is waiting, get your bonnet, 
don't be shy— 
Don't pretend your mother's angry, no my dear, she's 
only sly. 
Fetch your muff, and gloves, and tippet, soon you'll 
have a 
ruddy glow, 
For the air to-night is bracing; crack the whip—away 
we go. 
FAITILIAESS SARAH. 
35 
Sliding, gliding, riding, striding over the snow; 
Rapidly all sorrow our mirth dispels— 
Ringle-jingle, trinkle-trankle, off we go, 
To the merry music of our winter bells! 
Softest light the moon is beaming, see the stars in clus-
ters bright; 
For the gay pell-mell of winter, this is quite a 
sleigher's 
night. 
And the snow is crisp, unyielding, ice-gems deck the 
trees along, 
Nature's robed in sparkling jewels—give this night to 
mirth and song. 
Sliding, gliding, etc. 
Listen to our happy Voices, hear our merry jokes go 
round; 
Joy-inspiring is our laughter—how we make the air re-
sound. 
Let us distance every rival, lash the horses, pass the 
cup— 
Not till sober dawn is breaking will we break our revel 
up. 
Sliding, gliding, etc. 
FAITHLESS SARAH. 
Sung by Mn. HOWARD PAUL. 
No course of love runs smooth, they tells, but mine 
with grief nigh throttles. 
It's paved with flints and oyster shells, old nails and 
broken bottles! 
For cruel Sarah Tickles my heart has filled with 
prickles; 
Of men distrest I'm wretched-est! 
Oh, fickle Sarah 
Tickles! 
Oh, Sarah! all thro' you, my cup is running o'er! 
36 
OUR LIVELY NEIGHBOR. 
But there, there, there, there, what's the odds? 
She'll never care for me no more! 
She gave me every cause for hope—accepted shrimps 
and tea; 
And penny squares of scented soap, and photographs 
of me. 
With shilling brooches—thence to gloves at thirteen-
pence. 
Her path I 
strewed, and billed, and coo'd and what's 
my recompense ? 
Oh, Sarah! etc. 
From London Bridge I 
tried to drop, my mind with an-
guish filled, 
But on a 
coal barge came down plop, and precious near 
was killed! 
But, lor' my life I 
don't not value that, (snap fingers) 
I 
own't 
Myself to kill, I 
thinks I 
will—but no—I 
thinks won't. 
Oh, Sarah! etc. 
My con-sti-tu-tion, I 
fear, with poison won't agree! 
Besides, they give six months, I 
fear, to a 
fellow for 
felo-de-se. 
But nigh her I 
can't wait, so when I 
have put straight 
My bank 
affairs and railway shares, I 
mean to em-i-grate. 
Oh, Sarah! etc.

Or sirop sip, and scorch your lip with burning fragrant 
demi-lasse; 
Take a 
voiture de remise, and bid cocher drive slowly on, 
First to the Place VendOme, where stands the statue of 
Napoleon, 
Past the Tuderies and Bee de Bivoli, until the open 
Place de la Concorde you see. 
Fountains mounting, high up spouting, make you feel 
your senses doubting 
If 'tis France or fairy land, or Titania's park; 
Statues at you staring stony, Cleopatra's needle stolen 
by Boney.

There's a drive for groom and truck, and passenger

A 
trot when hot for lots who don't like exercise eques-
trian, 
For Paris is the place where elegance and grace, 
And fashion, folly, fighting, flirting run their race. 
Of promenades, the Boulevards of Paris most distract-
ing are— 
There every day some little play or funny scenes enact-
ing are, 
Where flaneurs loll, and idly stroll, and make a 
paper 
cigarette, 
And belles and beaux, in wonderous clothes, are every 
hour together met: 
Where fops in shops may stop, and drop a 
trifling little 
franc or two, 
Shopkeepers are so civil, that for nothing they say 
" 
Thank you" too; 
And people seem to meet, to talk and drink and eat, 
And leave their homes to laugh, and to live out in the 
street. 
Walking, talking, business baulking, whizzing, friz-
zing, wine uncorking, 
Such a 
whirl and worry that you don't know where 
you are; 
Noodles, poodles, hurry-scurry, over incessant hurry,

THE ENGLISH IN PARIS. 
Rattle tattle, place for prattle is the Boulevards. 
For Paris is the place, in case you're seeking for a 
holi-
day. 
Head quarters of iced waters, taes-a-gtes, tarts, and 
frivolity; 
The Boulevards for me, whenever I 
would see 
Mad manners, modes, and music, and millinery: 
Cavalry prance proudly by, as if for battle mad again; 
Procession of young ladies, all in white, bound for the 
Madeleine; 
Bevy of young conscripts, with their hats tricked out 
with paper too ; 
An English lady, who don't know " where that coach-
man's going to take her to. 
Nice gendarmes, and babes in arms, and nurses of the 
fattest sort ; 
Gandins, and military of the thin-waisted, cocked hatted 
sort, 
Swaggering to and fro, smoking as they go, pushing 
past fieurisles and marchands de coco. 
Omnibuses jingle, jangle, limonadiers tinkle tankle, 
Hustle, bustle, gamins, momans, et papa. 
Worry, scurry, lots of flurry, ever in a 
thorough hurry, 
Wonder, blunder, drums like thunder, on the Boule-
vards. 
For Paris is the place, in case you're seeking for a

THE ENGLISH IN PARIS, 
Sung by M RS. HOWARD PAUL. 
W HENE'ER pleasure carries the English to Paris, 
The subject of dinner's of gravest import; 
All of course speak French so " as to get on you know," 
" 
thuf poo," that is rather at school they were taught. 
To the restaurants hying, the carte rather shying, 
Afraid to say more than garcon or oui, oui, 
They think nous sommes Anglais, ii faut etre distingu, 
Surtout quam1 nous venons diner a 
Paris. 
A 
rich costly couple from Peckham, darned Dupple, 
Took over their daughters and young master D.; 
The eldest was haughty, and just over thirty, 
She said twenty-two (that's between you and me.) 
A 
sighing young scion of the house of O'Brien 
Was spooning the rich haughty eldest Miss D., 
And said, " Ah shure, si nous sommes Anglais ii faut etre 
distingue, 
Surtout quand nous venous diner a 
Paris." 
Once seated at table, begin they a 
Babel, 
A 
confusion of tongues such as never was heard? 
If they'd only speak English, some one might distin-
guish 
Their meaning— as 'tis, no one catches a 
word. 
There's no French in papa, and much less in mamma, 
The young ladies are silent, and so Master D. 
Says, "Si nous sommes Anglais ilfaut etre distingue, 
Surtout quand nous venons diner a 
Paris." 
BOTHER THE FLIES ! 
K 
Sung by MR. HOWARD PAUL, in his impersonation or" Poor

BOTHER the flies! they're a

Buzzing and biting from morning till night; 
Sticking on papers, distracting our senses, 
Floating in liquids, annoying our sight!

THE WIDOW MALONE. 
Jam pots selecting for sweet dissipation, 
Nipping our noses and blinding our eyes, 
Into our coffee persistently bobbing, 
Hark! the loud chorus of "BorHEr. THE Furs!" 
You want forty winks, and give way to the feeling, 
When, just as you cosily fall in a 
doze, 
A 
fly lets himself' slyly down from the ceiling, 
And dances a`jig on the tip of your nose. 
Or your health is proposed at a 
very swell dinner, 
Of course, to lisp out a 
response, you arise ; 
When a 
bluebottle quietly pops down your throttle, 
You're choked with a 
splutter of "BOTHER THE Frans!" 
At tea they vexatiously keep up their clamor, 
Each moment much thicker and louder they seem, 
That impudent fly oils his hair with your butter, 
Who takes every morning his bath in your cream. 
The patience of Job would at this grow exhausted, 
Philosophy only can hinder the cries— 
Of " bother the "--fiff! I 
think that was a 
settler— 
Missed him, by jingo!

THE WIDOW MALONE, 
Sung by M. nOWARD PAEE, 
Dm ye hear of the Widow Malone, och hone! 
Who lived in the town of Athlone, alone? 
She melted the hearts of the swains in them parts, 
So lovely was Widow Malone, och hone! 
Of lovers she had a 
full score or more, 
And fortunes they all had galore in store, 
From the minister down to the clerk of the Crown 
All came courting the Widow Malone, och hone! 
But so bashful Wag Mistress Malone, 'twas known 
No one ever could see her alone, och hone! 
DRAT THE RHEUMATICS. 
They might ogle and sigh, they could ne'er catch her 
eye, 
S 
modest was Mistress Malone, och hone! 
Till one Mister O'Brien, from Clare, how quare! 
(It's little for blushin' they care down there) 
Put his arms round her waist, kissed her ten times at 
least, 
And says he you're my Molly Malone, och hone! 
Then the widow they all thought so shy (?) my eye! 
Never thought of a 
simper or sigh, for why? 
" 
But Lucius," said she, " since you've now made so 
free, 
You may marry your Mary Malone, your own. 
There's a 
moral contained in my song, not wrong; 
And one comfort, it's not very long, but strong: 
If for widows you die, learn to kiss, not to sigh, 
For they're all like the Widow Malone, och hone! 
DRAT THEM RHEUMATICS.

And don't in my temper much sweetness perfess;

My bones is that tender, sich aches they ingender, 
The whole blesset day I'm a-screechin' out " oh!"

Drat them rheumatics as comes of damp attics, 
Through pecks full of troubles they makes us to go. 
Warm flannings don't move 'em, nor blisters improve 
'em, 
And doctors--consarn 'em, a 
passel of quacks: 
There ain't to my notions, more good in their lotions 
Than bathin' your jints with sweet ile and beeswax. 
The least drap of speerits I 
thinks has it merits, 
It seems for to stimpulate, somehow— Oh ! oh! 
Drat them rheumatics, and plague them damp attics, 
Which goes and tormentses a 
poor creetur so!

offen hears rumors of wars and/cOntumers, 
Sea sarpints, and comics as lights up the sky; 
Of steamboats a-bustin, and banks as folks trust in, 
Which never don't fret an old 'ooman like I; 
I 
cares for no papers, nor panics, nor capers, 
But blessin's on them as will tell me—Oh! ! 
What's good for damp attics, leastways the rheumatics, 
Which vvorrits and torters a

Hi ho, hi ho! my gloves are twenty-sixes. 
I'm mild although I 
look as fierce as a 
tiger, and amiable 
too, the fact is 
I'm a 
gentlegGorilla, and I 
must own, life's an up-hiller, 
passed all alone. 
Though folks look coldly, I 
mean you'll see, going in 
boldly for matrimonee. 
I'll take a

Come, dear ladies, here's a

is there 
no advance ?

Going for a 
perfect song, 'pon my life it's very wrong— 
Such a 
charming foreign swell's been seldom seen, 
oh! 
Lovely claws, handsome jaws, 
A 
complexion— quite perfection, 
See my carriage, who's for marriage. 
Hey brown, tho' brown, very brown, a 
brunette's better 
than an albino. 
They say I'm a 
link, I 
don't think it's true, 'twixt man 
and brute creation, 
Tho' I've no doubt it's the result of deep investigation • 
At all events, throughout the whole of this enlightened 
nation, 
The subject I 
at present am of general conversation. 
They say I'm a 
link, I 
don't think it's true, but two re-
moves—not wide oh! 
From Mister Hoop-de-doo-den-cloo, and Skid-a-ma-

Sung by Mns. HowARD PAUL, CS " 
Blue Beard." 
I'VE just dined out, I 
beg to say, and I 
feel gay and 
merry, 
I've quaffed Madeira, Hock, Champagne, old Port, Mo-
selle and Sherry; 
But 'twasn't those that touched my head, believe me, 
'tis no gammon, 
It wasn't what I 
drank at all, it was the blessed salmon— 
Salmon, salmon, I 
know it sounds like gammon, 
When one gets " boozy, foozy, 0," to lay it to the sal-
mon; 
Salmon, salmon, I 
fear it sounds like gammon, 
To " fish," about for an excuse and then " hook" up a 
salmon. 
I'll furnish you a 
prime receipt, in case you're melan-
choly— 
Invite a 
lot of folks to dine, and get no end of jolly ; 
When from the table you retire, try to say " Truly 
rural," 
You've thoroughly enjoyed yourself, 
if you make it 
" 
tooral looral." 
Fuddled, muddled, you're safe to get be-muddled, 
So don't say " Truly rural, 0," as long as you are fud-
dled. 
Tooral looral! I 
feel I'm getting nappy ! 
But what's the odds (hic)—what's the odds, so long as 
you are happy ?

K A—FOOZLE-1Thit 
Sung by Ma. HOWARD Pita.. 
I:sr ancient days there lived a 
Turk, 
A 
horrid beast, within the East, 
Who did the Sultan's dirty work, as Babah of Jerusalem 
He had a 
daughter sweet and smirk, 
Complexion fair, and—oh! such hair_ 
With naught about her like a 
Turk, except the name 
Ka-Foozle-Um! 
Chorus. 
Oh! Ka-Foozle-17m, the daughter of the 13abah. 
Not far a 
youth resided, too; 
His name was Sam ; he hated ham 
• 
EA-FOOZGE-UM 
47 
And pork, because he was a 
Jew, as strict as did Methu-
salem : 
He drove a 
trade and prospered well, 
In ancient hats, and skids of cats, 
And, ringing at the Babah's bell, he saw and. loved Ka-
Foozle-13m. 
If Sam had been a 
Mussulman 
He might have sold the Babah old, 
And, with a 
verse of Alcoran, have managed to bam-
boozle him; 
But, like a 
Jew, he tried to scheme— 
Passed, one night, late, the area gate, 
stole up to the Turk's hareem to confiscate Sa-
Foozle-Um. 
And 
The Babah was about a 
smoke— 
His slaves rushed in with horrid din— 
" 
Mashallah! dogs your house have broke; your wives 
they will bamboozle 'em!" 
The Babah wreathed his face in smiles, 
Came down the stair and witnessed there 
A 
faithless Jew, with triple tiles, a-kissing of Ka-Foozle-
Una! 
The pious Babah said no more 
Than seven prayers, but went up stairs 
Aud took a 
bow-string from a 
drawer and came back to 
Ka-roozle-Um. 
The maiden and the Jew he took 
And choked 'em both, and little loth 
Together pitched them in a 
brook—a brook hard by 
Jerusalem. 
And now commenced the Babah's ills: 
He had no peace for Sam's decease: 
The vengeful Jews bought up his bills, compatriots of 
Methusalena. 
They sued him in the courts below. 
He thought it best to shun arrest; 
And so he fled to Jericho, a 
city near Jerusalem.

.1B1111.12EB LORD. 
And still, the ancient legend goes, 
When day is gone from Lebanon, 
And when the eastern moonlight throws a 
shadow on 
Jerusalem, 
Between the wailing of the cats 
A 
sound there falls from ruined walls--
A 
ghost is seen with triple hats a-kissing of lia-Foozle-
Um. 
‘TEMIATER LOBA

W HEN I 
lived out in the Clapham Road, I 'ad a 
strange 
to-do, 
If it won't take up your time too long, why then I 
will 
tell you; 
And has we hall grows holder, so in course we lives to 
learn; 
But that affair 1 
speaks of, oh! it grtv'd my 'cart a 
turn. 
I 
was 'ousemaid you must 'ear, at thirteen pound a 
year, 
And next door there lived a 
footman who was sich a 
per 
feet dear, 
As 'andsome a 
young feller as you would wish to see, 
And while a-sweeping of the steps, he often glanced at 
me. 
When he jumped behind the karridge and he riz upon 
our views, 
I'm sure he stood almost six foot, not counting of his 
shoes • 
His 'air fell down in rinklets hall around his manly 'cad. 
And quite the gentleman he seemed—what master calls 
" 
well-bred ;" 
Sich whiskers he had too, of a 
silky blackish hue, 
And his karves was fairly gorjus, oh, upon my word it's 
true! 
JEMTATFT; LOOB. 
49 
And as the karridge rolled away, why all the servants 
sighed, 
For he looked much more commandin' than the gent as 
rode inside. 
So 
howns the soft impeachment, which he always 
looked so smart, 
His figger, karves, and wiskers quite completely won 
my 'cart; 
And oh! how comical I 
felt when first we 'ad a 
chat, 
My face it went all over red, my ' cart went pit-a- pat. 
It was only 'bout two days when a-meetin' me he says, 
"Will you be mine, Jemimer dear ?" and a 
weddin'-
ring displays, 
It is marriage I am mOanin'," and he called me 
" 
dearest life," 
And that day week I 
warnin' gave, in 'opes to be his 
wife. 
But cur courtin' it had scarce begun, and all seemed 
bright and clear, 
When one night I 
chanced to see hisself a-lookin' oh! 
so queer— 
His face was bare of wiskers, and his legs was shrunk 
and thin, 
And when I 
asked him what it meant, he guy'd a 'orrid 
grin; 
I 
saw I 'ad been done, and as sure as here I 
am— 
I 
found his karves was only stuffed, his wiskers all a 
sham. 
I 
told him he'd deceived me, that we never should 
agree, 
And that footman without wiskers took a 
knowin' glance 
at Inc. 
Now listen to my morial who footmen tall admires, 
'Cause they've got imposing figgers, and unto your 'and 
aspires, 
Before you promise marridge, recollect my wretched 
fate, 
Pinch their karves, and pull their wiskers, lest you find 
them false too late:

SCANDAL HAS A BUSY TONGUE. 
If you don't you will be grieved, and I'm sure I'll be be-
lieved, 
When I 
says, in gettin' married you don't ought to be

That he was a

That flunkey with false wisk-ers takes a

SCANDAL HAS A BUSY TONGUE. 
Sung by Ma. and Mits. HOWARD PAur„ as " Miss Tabby Pm" an 
old-young-lady. 
On, what a 
dreadful naughty place the world is now be-
coming fast! 
The state of things may well disgrace, but surely it can 
never last. 
For ev'ry day such tales we hear, as freeze one's very 
blood with fear, 
And cause the hair to stand erect in dread dismay! 
Sure busy-bodies are a 
pest who peck in pieces as they 
go; 
For mischief-making I 
detest, but still I think you 
ought to know 
Some things which I 
have heard, so if you'll breathe no 
word, 
I'll tell you ( quite in confidence) what people say. 
"Scandal has a busy tongue," has oft been written, 
said and sung, 
To high and low, both old and young, and well indeed 
it may! 
Else how little we should know, of all that's passing to 
and fro ; 
What people do, and where they go, and what they say, 
SCANDAL HAS A BUSY TONGUE. 
51 
A.'s over ears in debt, they say,— 
And B. gets tipsy every night,— 
And Mrs. C. has run away 
With Captain D., the odious fright! 
And E. bought laudanum, wicked rake, 
But drank some ketchup in mistake; 
And how Miss F. conducts herself I 
dare not speak! 
And G., I'm told, neglects his wife,— 
And H., who lives in style so grand, 
Made all his wealth in early life, 
By sweeping crossings in the Strand! 
And that young minx, Miss I., whom people think so 
shy, 
Has popped the question twice, herself, within one 
week! 
Scandal has a 
busy tongue, etc. 
Then J., who moral fame has earned, 
At home deems smoking no offence,— 
And K., from Sydney just returned, 
Went oat at government expense,— 
And L. and M., those pretty girls, 
Are naught but paint, false teeth, and curls.— 
Of N. and 0. such things I 
know as would sur—prise! 
The P.'s, who always dress so gay, 
They pinch, and starve, nor e'er relax, 
They only have two meals a-day, ' 
To spend their money on their backs! 
And Mrs. Q., so " chaste," her diamonds are all paste! 
And R. 's 
tall footmen, both are bailiffs in disguise. 
Scandal has a 
busy tongue, etc. 
There's S., who boasts so much about 
His " high connections!" 
Eugh! the wretch! 
The truth has only just come out, 
He's second cousin to Jack Ketch! 
And there's that stuck--up Mrs. T., 
No better than she ought to be! 
And V., X., V., and W. and Z. as well. 
And now I'm out of breath, and faint; 
52 
MARGABETTA. 
Such dreadful tales may well appall, 
But, shocking as is each complaint, 
I 
know of something worse than all! 
Ah! if you only knew what people say of you, 
You'd never sleep another wink !—but I'll not tell! 
Scandal has a 
busy tongue, etc. 
MARGARETTA. 
Sung by Mus. Howitno PAUL, in her representation of " Mr. Sims 
Reeves." 
INTErEN I 
was in my teens I 
loved dear Margaretta— 
I 
know not what it means, I 
cannot now forget her ; 
That vision of the past my head is ever crazing, 
Yet when I 
saw her last, I 
could not speak for gazing. 
Queen of the rural maids, my dark-eyed Margaretta ; 
The heart the mind upbraids that struggles to forget her. 
My love I 
know will seem a 
wayward boyish folly; 
But, au! it was a 
dream, most sweet, most melancholy. 
Were mine the world's domain, to me 'twere fortune 
better, 
To be a 
boy again, and dream of Margaretta. 
Oh! memory of the past, why linger to regret her ? 
My first love was my last, and that is Margaretta. 
WHITE DAISY.

And in your madrigals reveal, reveal my love.

Ask for my heart again; 
While all the warblers of the air 
Combine to sing the praises of my fair, 
With pipes, and trills, and wand'rings mazy, 
Singing—All nature loves thee, sweet White Daisy. 
Where her small foot is set, springs the sweet violet, 
And pink-lipped daisies kiss her dress's hem ; 
Making, with tiny flowers, her foot-prints in the bowers, 
For joy that she should take her name from them. 
She needs no diadem, because her golden hair 
Is so surpassing fair. 
MY OWN, MY GUIDING- STAR, 
Sung by M RS. 
HOWARD PAUL, as " Sims Reeves." 
TEIY gentle voice would lead me on, 
My own, my guiding star, 
Till every sense of life were gone— 
E'en wert thou placed afar. 
But now thou deignst so near to shine, 
With rays that warm and cheer ; 
The surest, firmest hopes are mine ; 
My soul is strange to fear. 
Thou need'st not doubt, thou need'st not grieve, 
I 
bear a 
potent spell ; 
Be certain love will ne'er deceive 
The heart that serves Wm 
well. 
I 
know my path will lead me right, 
With such a 
prize in view, 
And happy omens bless my sight, 
That must—that shall be true.

BELIEVE ME, IP ALL THOSE ENDEARING YOUNG 
CHARMS. 
Bv.r.ryvE me, if all those endearing young charms 
Which I 
gaze on so fondly to- day, 
Were to change by to-morrow, and fleet in my arms 
Like fairy gifts—fading away, 
Thou would'st still be ador'd, as this moment thou. art, 
Let thy loveliness fade as it will ; 
And around the dear ruin each wish of my heart 
Would entwine itself verdantly' still! 
It is not while beauty and youth are thine OW11, 
And thy cheeks unprofaned by a 
tear, 
That the fervor and faith of a 
soul can be known, 
To which time will but make thee more dear! 
Oh! the heart that has truly lov'd never forgets, 
But as truly loves on to the close. 
As the sunflower turns on her god, when he sets, 
The same looks which she turned when he rose! 
Sung by M RS. HOWARD PAUL in her represenation of " Sims

COME into the garden, Maud, 
For the black bat night has flown— 
Come into the garden, Maud, 
I 
am here at the gate alone; 
For the woodbine spice are wafted abroad, 
And the musk of the r6ses blown. 
For a 
breeze of morning moves, 
And the planet of love is on high, 
Beginning to faint in the light that she loves, 
MY PRETTY JANE.

On a 
bed of daffodil sky; 
To faint in the light of the sun she loves, 
To faint in its light and to die. 
Queen of the rosebud, garden of girls, 
Come hither, the dances are done; 
In gloss of satin, and glimmer of pearls, 
Queen, lily, and rose, in one ; 
Shine out, little head, sunning over with curls, 
To the flowers, and be their sun. 
She is coming, my own, my sweet; 
Were it ever so airy a 
tread, 
My heart would hear her and beat, 
Were it earth in an earthy bed.

MACGREGOR'S GATHERING, 
Scotch Song. 
THE moon's on the lake, and the mist on the brae, 
And the clan has a 
name that is nameless by day. 
Our signal for fight, which from monarchs we drew, 
Must be heard but by night in our vengeful " haloo ! ' 
Then haloo! haloo! haloo! Gregalach. 
If they rob us of name and pursue us with beagles, 
Give their roofs to the flames, and their flesh to the 
eagles. 
Then gather, gather, gather! 
While there's leaves in the forest, and foam on the river, 
Macgregor, despite them, shall live, aye, for ever! 
Glenorchy's proud mountains, Colchurn and her towers, 
Glenstrae and Glenlyon no longer are ours, 
We're landless, landless, landless, Gregalach. 
Through the depths of Loch Katrine the steed shall 
career, 
O'er the peak of Ben Lomond the galley shall steer, 
And the rocks of Craig Royston like icicles melt,

E'er our wrongs be forgot, or our vengeance unfelt. 
Then haloo! haloo! Gregalach.

Fairer than ever, with death's pallid hue ; 
Mortal thou art not, I 
humbly adore thee, 
Yea, with a 
love which thou knowest is true. 
Look'st thou in anger ? 
Ah! no, such a 
feAng 
Ne'er in thy too gentle heart had a 
place ; 
Softly the smile of forgiveness is stealing, 
Eily, my own, o'er thy beautiful face. 
Once would my heart with the wildest emotion 
Throb, dearest Eily, when near me wert thou, 
Now I 
regard thee with deep calm devotion; 
Never, bright angel, I 
loved thee as now. 
Though in this world were so cruelly blighted 
All the fond hopes of thy innocent heart, 
Soon in a 
holier region united, 
Eily Mavourneen, we never shall part.

PADDY BLAKE'S ECHO. 
Sung by M RS. HOWARD PAUL. 
IN 
the gaps of Daub o 
there's an echo or so, 
And some of them echoes is very surprising ; 
You'll think in this stave, that I 
mane to desaive, 
For a 
ballad's a 
thing you expect to find lies in. 
But sartin and thrue, in that hill fornint you, 
There's an echo as thrue and as safe as the bank, too, 
Just civilly spike " How d'ye do Paddy Blake?" 
The echo politely says, " Very well, thank you." 
One day Teddy Keogh with Kate Connor did go 
To hear from the echo this wonderful tale, sir ; 
But the echo, they say, was conthrary that day, 
Or perhaps Paddy Blake had gone out for a 
walk, sir. 
Now says Teddy to Kate, "'Tis too hard to be bate 
By this deaf and dumb baste of an echo so lazy, 
But if we both shout to each other, no doubt 
We'll make up an echo between us, my daisy." 
" 
Now Kitty," says Teddy, " to answer be ready." 
" 
Oh very well thank you," cried out Kitty then, sir. 
" 
Would you like to be wed, Kitty darling," says Ted. 
" 
Oh very well, thank you," says Kitty again, sir. 
"Do you like me?" says Teddy, and Kitty quite ready, 
Cried very " Very well thank you," with laughter be-
guiling.

RNEY O'TOOLE.

I 
think you'll confess Teddy could not do less 
Than pay his respects to the lips that were smiling. 
Oh dear Paddy Blake may you never forsake 
Those hills that return us such echoes endearing, 
And girls all translate, their sweet answers like Kate ; 
No faithlessness doubting, no treachery fearing. 
And boys, be you ready, like frolicsome Teddy. 
Be earnest in loving, tho' given to joking; 
And thus when inclined, may all true lovers find, 
Sweet echoes to answer from hearts they're invoking. 
BARNEY O'TOOLE. 
Sung by M RS. HOWARD PAUL. 
On be still, Barney dear, with your jealous complaints, 
For you know that your darling's as true as the saints ; 
Oh, you'll break the young heart that you won long ago, 
And that would be murder, dear Barney you know. 
It's yourself that would tell me a 
different tale, 
With your arm round my waist in the Dargle's sweet 
Vale, 
When your own winning tongue made your Norah a 
fool, 
And taught her to love you so, Barney O'Toole. 
Oh, Barney, Barney, Barney, Barney O'Toole, 
And taught her to love you so, Barney O'Toole. 
Oh you swore that the wild rose that grew o'er my 
head, 
And the violet hid in its soft mossy bed, 
Were the emblems of innocence, beauty and truth, 
And you said, Barney dear, I 
was fairer than both. 
Am I 
different now, that you're always in doubt, 
With your cruel suspicions of what I'm about? 
You had better be careful, or by the same rule 
I'll be jealous of you, Mister Barney O'Toole.

And believe that your Norah is faithful and true ; 
For she lives for you, Barney, and only for. 
you. 
It's your own winning tongue that my heart can beguile, 
For there's love in your eye, and there's truth in your 
smile. 
Oh my heart has been taught in affection's fond school, 
That I 
can't live without you, dear Barney O'Toole. 
Oh! Barney, Barney, Barney, Barney O'Toole.

HURRAH FOR THE HIGHLANDS. 
Scotch Song by M RS. HOWARD PAUL. 
HURRAH for the Highlands, the stern Scottish High-
lands, 
The home of the clansmen, the bold and the free, 
Where the clouds love to rest on the mountain's rough 
breast. 
Ere they journey afar on the is-land-less sea ; 
'Tis there where the ca-ta-ract sings to the breeze, 
As it dashes in foam, like a 
spirit of light; 
'Tis there the bold fisherman bounds o'er the sea, 
In his fleet tiny bark through the perilous night. 
Then hurrah for the Highlands, the stern Scottish High-
lands, 
The home of the clansmen, the bold and the free. 
Where the clouds love to rest on the mountain's rough 
breast, 
Ere they j 
ourney afar o'er the is-land-less sea. 
Chorus. 
Then hurrah for the Highlands, the stern Scottish 
Highlands, 
THE TLILID YOUNG MAN.

The home of the clansmen, the bold and the free, 
Where the clouds love to rest on the mountain's rough 
breast, 
Ere they journey afar o'er the is-land-less sea. 
Hurrah, hurrah, hurrah, for the Highlands, Hurrah! 
'Tis the land of deep shadow, of sunshine and shower, 
Where the hurricane revels in madness on high; 
For there it has might that can war with its power, 
In the wild dizzy cliffs that are cleaving the sky. 
I 
have trod merry England and dwelt on its charms, 
I've wandered through Erin, the gem of the sea. 
But the Highlands alone the true Scottish heart warms. 
Her heather is blooming her eagles are free. 
Then hurrah for the Highlands, the stern Scottish 
Highlands, 
The home of the clansmen, the bold and the free, 
Where the clouds love to rest on the mountain's rough 
breast, 
Ere they journey afar o'er the is-land-less sea.

THE TIMID YOUNG MAN. 
Sung by MR. HOWARD PAUL. 
T HEY call me " sister Willie," for they tell me oft in 
fun, 
My manners are so ladylike, I 
ought to pass for. 
one. 
And if I'd wear a 
proper dress, and change my style of 
hair, 
I'd make a 
very charming girl, is what they all declare. 
But my papa is so cross, and talks in such a 
way, 
A " noodle," " milksop," " muff," or " spoon,' he calls 
me every day; 
62 
A MAN So FULL OF FUN. 
He does not mean to be unkind, I 
know he don't, but 
then 
I'm not the same as other girls, I 
mean as other men. 
I'm not the same as other girls, etc. 
It's not my fault rip timid, and all rough companions 
dread, 
I 
can't smoke, it makes me ill; and wine gets in my 
head, 
The op'ra, concert, ball or play, possess no charm for me, 
I 
much prefer the Wayworth, or a 
friendly cup of tea. 
But best of all I 
like the park, for oh, it is such fun, 
To feed the pretty little ducks with little bits of bun. 
I 
often notice people smile, which makes me blush, but 
then 
I'm not the same as other girls, I 
mean, as other men. 
I'm not the same as other girls, etc. 
I 
ne'er can hope to marry, and my heart it sorely tries, 
I 
don't know how to ask them, and the girls don't care 
for sighs, 
And if I 
wrote my feelings down, and left them at the 
door, 
I 
should be too ashamed to meet the lady any more. 
But to the altar if I 
went, so great would be my dread, 
That when I 
had to give the ring, my knees would 
knock instead. 
It's very funny—is it not?—to feel like this, but then 
I'm not the same as other girls, I 
mean as other men. 
I'm not the same as other girls, etc. 
Sung by M n. HOWARD PAUL. 
THERE was a 
man, a 
funny man, a 
man so full of fun, 
Of drollest wags that ever lived, that funny man was 
one; 
A MAN SO FULL OP FUN. 
He said and did such funny things, and had such funny 
ways, 
As would astonish all our nerves in these dull prosy 
days. 
So widely did his funny deeds, and funny fame resound, 
The population held their sides, for twenty miles 
around ; 
And if they heard his funny voice, or spied him from 
afar, 
It gave the signal for a 
storm of 
Laughing, shouting, roaring, screeching, 
Stamping, gasping, cries beseeching, 
Chuckling, wagging, waiscoat polking, 
Aching, splitting, cracking, choking, 
Crying, dying, buttons flying, 
Ha, ha ha, ha, ha, ha, ha! 
For he was a 
very very very funny man; 
People said 'twas like a 
play, his funny face to scan. 
Never, never, never, never since the world began, 
Had there been by mortal seen, 
Oh, such 
funny man! 
To funny whims and funny freaks, this funny man in-
clined ; 
He wore his nose above his chin, his coat-tails hung be-
hind. 
He'd rather keep a 
dollar bill, than lend it you or me, 
And if he wrote the name of cat, would spell it c-a-t! 
He thought the earth went round the sun, that pretty 
girls wear smiles! 
Said times were hard! good people scarce! and freely 
gave advice; 
And other things more funny still of him recorded are, 
Which kept the neighborhood convulsed with 
Laughing, shouting, roaring, screeching, etc. 
He had a 
habit when he slept of closing both his eyes, 
Thought telegraphs were " useful things," distrusted 
mutton pies, 
And wore his hat upon his head! his boots upon his 
toes! 
But if he took a 
pinch of snuff, would put it up his 
nose! 
He thought that parlez-vous was French! that two and 
two made four! 
That woman's No! meant sometimes Yes! that taxes 
were a 
bore. 
And even things more funny still of him recorded are, 
Which kept folks going night and day, with 
Laughing, shouting, roaring, screeching, etc. 
But lo! one dismal winter's morn, abroad the news was 
spread, 
The funny man turned up his toes—in other words was 
dead. 
And ere the shock had passed sway, 'twas whispered 
that his death, 
Had happened to the funny man through merely want 
of breath! 
So mindful of a 
strange request, which in his will was 
found, 
They put him in a 
wooden box, and laid him under 
ground; 
But even to this very day, the people near and far 
Will talk about his funny deeds, with 
Laughing, shouting, roaring, screeching, etc. 
MY WIFE IS A WOMAN OF MIND,

M Y 
wife is a 
woman of mind, 
And Fowler, who looked at her bumps, 
Vowed that ne'er was found in a

Such large intellectual lumps. 
Ideality large as an egg, 
With causality great were combined; 
MY BUD IN HEAVEN. 
65 
He charged me ten shillings and said, 
"Sir, your wife is a 
woman of mind." 
She's too clever to care how she looks, 
And will horrid blue spectacles wear, 
Not because she supposes they give her 
A 
fine intellectual air; 
No, she pays no regard to appearance, 
And she combs all her front hair behind, 
Not because she is proud of her forehead, 
But because she's a 
woman of mind. 
She makes me a 
bushel of verses, 
But never a 
pudding or tart; 
If I 
hint I 
should like one, she vows 
I'm an animal merely at heart. 
I've noticed she spurns not the pastry, 
Whene'er at a 
friend's we have dined, 
And has always had two plates of pudding, 
Such plates! for a 
woman of mind!

ONE bud the gard'ner gave me, 
A

To cherish undefiled. 
It lay upon my bosom, 
It was my hope, my pride ; 
Perhaps it was an idol, 
Which I 
must be denied.

THERE'S A GOOD TIME COMING, GIRLS. 
For just as it was opening 
In glory to the day, 
Came down the Heavenly gard'ner 
And took my bud away. 
Yet not in wrath He took it, 
A 
smile was on his face, 
And tenderly and kindly 
He bore it from its place! 
Fear not, me thought He whispered, 
Thy bud shall be restored, 
I 
take it but to plant it 
In the garden of the Lord. 
Then bid me not to sorrow 
As those who hopeless weep, 
For He who gave hath taken, 
And He who took can keep. 
And night and morn together, 
By the open gate of prayer, 
I'll go in to my darling, 
And sit beside him there. 
I 
know 'twill open for me, 
Poor sinner though I 
be, 
For His dear sake who keeps it, 
And keeps my bud for me!

want some cash," you'll get it for the 
asking.
There'sagood time coming girls, a 
good time coming! 
Wait a 
bit! wait for it just a 
little longer. 
There's a 
good time coming girls, 
A 
good time coming! 
Stifle sighs! dry your eyes! mind them too the stronger; 
A 
good time's coming, girls! 
A good time's coming! 
Understand—close at hand! wait a 
little longer. 
Then you'll lack sufficient room to store fond lovers' 
pledges, 
Orange blossoms sweet will bloom, quite common to the 
hedges: 
All may marry when they please, when and where they 
mean too. 
Sweet hearts will be thick as peas—yes, and quite as 
green too. 
In the good time coming girls! etc. 
There's a 
good time coming, girls! 
A 
good time coming! 
One to last! coming fast! nerving you the stronger! 
A 
good time's coming, girls! 
A 
good time's coming! 
You will see! wait a 
wee—just a 
little longer! 
Freckles then no face will bear, " spots," attract no 
vision. 
"Blacks" and smuts be things that were, red noses a 
tradition ; 
Grace 
will everywhere abound, and with 
careful 
pinches, 
The largest waist will measure round, just barely seven 
inches. 
In the good time coming, etc. 
EARLY IN THE MORNING. 
There's a 
good time coming,. girls, 
A 
good time coming! 
Oh so nice, ' twill entice, heart to heart the stronger ; 
A 
good time's coming, girls! 
A 
good time's coming! 
Don't despair 
patience bear! wait a 
little longer ; 
Plums will ripen all the year, men will give . 
up smok-
ing, 
"Horrid" clubs and lager bier, with other ways pro-
voking. 
Kisses too, will be so sweet, each maid the bliss who 
lacking, 
At recollection of the treat her lips will keep on smack-
ing. 
In the good time coming, etc. 
There's a 
good time coming, girls! 
A 
good time coming! 
Do not fret! bear it yet! watch with hope the stronger; 
A 
good time's coming, girls! 
A 
good time's coming! 
P'raps to-day! who can say I 
wait a 
little longer; 
Pleasure then will rule the day—work of all kinds scorn-
ing. 
Ev'ry night a 
ball or party; pic-nics every morning; 
Perfumes sweet will load the air, little birds keep sing-
ing; 
The world will be a 
fancy fair, with marriage bells e'er 
ringing. 
In the good time coming, etc. 
"EARLY IN THE MORNING," 
Sung by MR. and MRS. HOWARD PAUL. 
EARLY in the morning, at the break of day, 
-When the balmy breeze did blow, 
A NOREIBLE TALE. 
69 
I 
went a 
roaming thro' the fields away, 
Early in the morning, merrily 0! 
And I 
meet a 
sweet lass coming towards me; 
Oh, such a 
neat Lass she seemed to be, 
My heart began to beat as it never beat before, 
Oh, I 
would give the world if I 
could meet with her once 
more. 
Early every morning, at the break of day, 
When the balmy breezes blow 
I 
go a 
roaming thro' the fields away; 
Early every morning, merrily 0! 
And at every turning, and cozy place I 
pass, 
With hope my heart is bursting to meet that pretty lass; 
Oh, if I 
should meet her, I'm resolved without delay, 
To implore and to entreat her to name the wedding day. 
A 
NORRIBLE TALE, 
On, a 
norrible tale I 
have to tell, 
Of a 
sad disaster that befell, 
A 
family that once resided, 
Just in the very same thoroughfare as I 
did, 
The parient was so green a 
guffin, 
He never liked no fun nor man, 
And he never made the least endeavor, 
To make a 
joke,•not whatsumever. 
Chorus. 
For oh, it is such a 
norrible tale, 
'Twill make your faces all turn pale, 
Your eyes with grief will be over3ome 
Tweedle, twadle, twidie, twidle twum, 
They never saw no companee, 
Tho' they was a 
most respectable familee; 
Sung by J. 
L. 
TOOLE, arta MR. HOWARD PAUL. 
70 
NORRIELE TALE. 
And every boy, and every gal, 
Grew hy-po-con-der-i-a-cal. 
They thought they had all sorts of sorrows, 
And conjured up all kinds of horrors, 
Each had a 
face as long as a 
ladder, 
And was frightened into fits if they see their own shud-
der. 
For oh, it is sich a 
norrible tale, etc. 
They sat with the curtains drawn down tight, 
On purpose to keep out the light ; 
Father, mother, sister and brother, 
Never spoke a 
word to one another. 
Well, at last, this doleful, dismal lot, 
So very me-lan-cho-ly got, 
That an end to theirselves they did agree. 
When they had settled which end it was to be. 
For oh, it is such a 
norrible tale, etc. 
First the father into the garden did walk, 
And cut his throat with a 
lump of chalk; 
Then the mother an end to herself she put, 
By hanging of herself in the water-but ; 
Then the sister went down on her bended knees, 
And smothered herself with toasted cheese. 
But the brother who was a 
determined young fellow, 
Went and poisoned himself with his gingham umbrella. 
For oh, it is such a 
norrible tale, etc. 
Then the little baby in the cradle, • 
Shot itself dead with the silver ladle, 
While the servant girl, seeing what they did, 
Strangled herself with the saucepan lid; 
The miserable cat, by the kitchen fire, 
Swallowed a 
portion of the fender and did expire, 
And a 
fly on the ceiling—this case was the worst one— 
Went and blowed itself up with " spontaneous combus-
tion." 
For oh, it is such a 
norrible tale, etc. 
f 
THE LAST WOlIANt 
71 
Then in there walked the auctioneer, 
Who did with the furniture disappear; 
And the broker's men, this ain't no fable, 
Made himself away with a 
three-legged table. 
When the walls saw this, their sides they splits, 
The windows crashed theirselves to bits, 
And so universal was the slaughter—late, 
There was nothing left, at all, but an unpaid water-rate. 
For oh, it is such a 
norrible tale, etc. 
MORAL. 
So here's a 
moral if you choose, 
Don't never give way to the blues; 
Or you may come to the dreadful ends, 
Of these, my melancholy friends. 
For ain't it now, a 
norrible tale! 
How 
it's made your faces all turn pale, 
Your eyes with grief is overcome, 
Tweedle, twadle, twidle, twidle twain. 
For ain't it now, a 
norrible tale, etc. 
THE LAST WOMAN. 
Written by SAM LOVER, and sung by MRS. HOWARD PAUL. 
HAVE you ever heard the story of the very
. " Last man," 
that remnant of creation, 
A 
state of single blessedness suggesting, not to me the 
most agreeable contemplation . 
For I 
have no spite against the men myself, or I 
might 
say, indeed, I 
heartily wish them well, 
But as for the women, I 
wouldn't much care if the sexton 
had them all with his ding dong bell, 
All the women, save myself, from whence I 
conceive a 
most excellent plan, 
And one much more amusing than the doleful old delu-
sion of that " last" poor man, 
72 
THE LAST WOMAN. 
For oh, if I 
were the last woman, oh, if I 
were the last 
woman, 
Oh, if I 
were the last woman, what fun, what fun it 
would be; 
My slaves all around I 
would summon to kneel down to 
me. 
For the men would be then, would be then at my feet. 
Oh, what a 
triumph, a 
triumph complete, 
Oh, what a 
triumph, a 
triumph complete. 
One woman alone, what fun. 
One Woman alone, what fun. 
To win me throughout every nation, would be the grand 
speculation, 
To win me throughout every nation, would be the grand 
speculation, 
Would be the grand speculation, would become the 
grand speculation. 
His last guinea, 
Each man would embark it, his last guinea, 
Each man would embark it, his last guinea— 
And how my shares would go up in the market! 
Number one 1—oh, what fun! 
How my shares would go up in the market! 
Pal lal, lal lal, lal de lal la. 
More attractive I'd be than a 
siren. 
I'd rule the men 
with a 
rod of iron. 
Their noses on grindstones I'd rub down to snubs, 
I'd banish cigars, and I'd shut up the clubs. 
Oh, how my shares would go up in the market! 
My wink would fetch ten thousand pound, 
My smile a 
million—" kiss hand" a 
billion, 
And kings would ask me to be crowned. 
I 
fear there would be the deuce to pay, 
Five hundred duels they'd fight each day, 
No magician e'er held a 
wand with half the power of my 
preference bond. 
Oh, how my shares would go up in the market! 
Pal lal, lal lal, lad de lal la.
