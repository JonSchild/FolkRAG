I enjoyed discussing the various aspects of the American Folklif e
 
Festival with you.
 It appears as though the "Regional America" segment
 
coincides perfectly with the research goals of our survey.  We are look-
ing forward to talking with you and Ralph Rinzler about ways in which we
 
might cooperate.
 I assume that the morning of May 21 is suitable.
 Please
 
let me know what time you would like us to come by.
 As I indicated, the
 
group will include Wilbur Zelinsky from Penn State, Steve Tweedie and me.
 
I am enclosing samples of the music, religion, and "place" ques-
tionaires.
 George Carney put together the former.
 Steve Tweedie patterned
 
the religion instrument after one developed by Charles Y.  Glock & Rodney
 
Stark in their survey of Christian Beliefs in 1963.
 Preliminary testing
 
has been done in Oklahoma.
 The questionaire is probably too long in its
 
present form, and a few of the questions need revision.
 I designed the
 
one on place to measure variations in the people -place bond.
 
You have Hilliard's food questionaire and I am working on one deal-
ing with games and sport.
 All of these could be shortened considerably
 
for administration at the Festival.
 
We look forward to seeing you on Friday.
 
erely,�

THE ATLAS & DATA BANK OF NORTH AMERICAN CULTURE:  A BRIEF PROSPECTUS
 
The Society for the North American Cultural Survey (
SNACS) is initiating
 
work in 1976 on the first general Atlas of North American Culture, one that
 
will depict and analyze as comprehensively as possible all the more significant
 
phases of the folk and popular culture of the contemporary United States and
 
Canada.  In addition to.numerous maps with accompanying text covering the entire
 
continental area and those treating some topics at a regional or local scale,
 
we shall create a massive, machine-readable data bank for a large array of
 
potential investigations by students of the North American scene.
 
The Atlas will appear as a series of volumes, the first three of which will
 
deal with the regional and other dimensions of : Foodways; Sports and Games;
 
and Music and Dance.  At least six other volumes are projected for future pro-
duction.  We are not prepared to offer a detailed Table of Contents for any
 
volume at this stage; but it may be useful to indicate something of the range
 
of items t
o be covered in Volume I on Foodways.  Thus, among other possible
 
topics, we shall include:
 
-- Which of a lengthy inventory of various f
oods, beverages, and stimu-
lants are known or used at various points in North America?
 
-- To what degree are such items preferred and consumed? and to what
 
degree are they avoided?
 
-- What are they called locally or regionally?
 
-- Methods of food preparation, serving, and preservation.
 
-- Meal and snacking patterns.
 
-- Seasonal, diurnal, and holiday patterns of diet.
 
Food festivals.
 
-- Social, religious, ethnic, and class connotations of various food and
 
drink items and dietary patterns.
 
-- Regionalisms in restaurants.
 
-- Food superstitions and folklore.
 
-- Symbolic attributes of various kinds of food and drink.
 
Each of the first three, as well as subsequent, volumes will contain:
 
(
1)  An introduction detailing the purpose, organization, limitations, and
 
other basic facts above the volume;
 
(
2)  A set of original maps, utilizing appropriate scales, areal coverage,
 
and symbolism, based upon data especially collected for the project through
 
a carefully organized information-gathering network;
 
(
3)  A selection of maps reproduced and/or redrawn from older sources,
-
published and unpublished;
 
(
4)  A verbal description and analysis of each map, or group of maps, which
 
will expound their significance, relate what i
s known and remains to be .
l
earned,
 
and how the particular topic i
s related to other segments of the Atlas; 
(
5)  An annotated bibliography of the subject at hand; and
 
(
6)  A detailed index to maps and t
ext.

Funding Prospects
 
In addition to the N
.E.H. proposal described in the November Newsletter, the
 
Executive Committee is currently discussing alternative funding possibilities
 
with the Smithsonian Institute, H
.E.W., the A.A.G., National Geographic, and
 
approximately 400 Food and Drink Trade Organizations and Corporations.  The lat-
ter source has yielded a considerable amount of data and encouragement, but no
 
funding as yet.  A copy of the letter sent to these various organizations is
 
attached.
 
S
tatus of Scratch Atlas I & II
 
The original two hundred copies of Volume I edited and printed at L
.S.U. under
 
the supervision of Milton Newton, Jr. have now been depleted.  However, an addi-
tional one hundred copies have been printed at O
.S.U. and are now available upon
 
request for $10 per copy.  We are also sending out back orders of Volume I so please
 
be patient.  Newton and Carney still need more published and unpublished maps for
 
Volume II. Please scour your files, desk drawers, and libraries for maps dealing.
 
with folk and/or popular culture and send them to us or bring them to Bowling Green
 
meeting. A supply of Scratch Atlas Volume I will also be available.

Which foods and beverages are most popular where?  Why is there such great place-to-
place variation in the American diet; in the ways we prepare, serve, and preserve our
 
f
ood?  What is the nature of seasonal and daily dietary patterns?  In what ways do social,
 
religious, ethnic, and class characteristics affect our eating preferences?  These are a
 
sample of the questions which the SOCIETY FOR THE NORTH AMERICAN CULTURAL SURVEY is asking
 
about our "foodways."
 
The long term goal of the S
ociety is to produce an Atlas and Data Bank of North
 
American Culture (
see Attachment).  Volume I will be concerned with eating and drinking
 
habits.  We plan to include maps and text dealing with a complete inventory of foods,
 
beverages, condiments and stimulants consumed in the United States.
 
The SOCIETY FOR THE NORTH AMERICAN CULTURAL SURVEY i
s composed of individuals from
 
numerous academic fields; Anthropology, Geography, English, Folklore, Sociology and
 
Economics, as well as a wide sampling of folklore buffs.  A membership drive to enroll
 
people from all walks of life is now underway.  The Society is currently housed at Oklahoma
 
S
tate University.  Cooperating institutions include the Pennsylvania State University,
 
Louisiana State University, the New York State University Folklore Center at Cooperstown,
 
Texas A & M University, and the University of Lavalle, Quebec, Ontario.
 
An undertaking of this magnitude requires a considerable amount of financial support.
 
The aforementioned universities have, and continue to provide substantial resources.  We
 
have requested $
507,000 from the National Endowment for the Humanities to fund the seg-
ments concerning foodways, games and sports.
 If our request is approved, support would
 
commence July 1
, 1976, carrying through 1979.
 
There is a need for additional money to cover the costs of data collection, analysis
 
and display.  There is also a need for marketing data which only trade organizations and
 
individual companies can provide.  The time is ripe for the formation of an alliance of
 
scholarly, public, and corporate forces.
 I hope you will be able to lend your support to
 
our project.  If you would like additional information or wish to become actively involved
 
in the research, please let me know.
 I or one of the members of the Society would be
 
delighted to meet with you personally and describe our activities in much greater detail.

Subject:
 telephone conversation with John Rooney
 
Dr. John Rooney, Executive Director of the Society for the Survey of
 
North American Culture (
a spin-off of the American Folklore Spciety
 
cotrmittee that got the Scratch ttlas together) telephoned this mornin€.
 
I
le is coming to Washington May 21 and has a 2
:00 meeting with Alborn
 
of the Smithsonian; along with him will be two colleagues: Wilbur
 
Zolinsky from Penn State and Steve Tweedy, Oklahoma State.  All three,
 
I believe, are cultural geographers.  The purpose of their meeting is
 
to discuss with Alborn ways in which the Smithsonian can cooperate
 
in their survey project.  Over the phone, Alborn had suggested Rooney
 
get in touch with Ralph and consider setting up "a booth" at the Festival;
 
I took the call.
 
I described the Festival and xxkxzK
:k gave a brief account of the research
 
projects s already n
it&xxgak planned by FAF staff.  Dr. Rooney was very
 
excited, thinks our ideas are great and wants very much to meet with us
 
to determine how t
ie/we can further his committee's research ideas.  he
 
has already prepared or has in process kkx questionnaires on the following
 
topics:
 
food (
 will be shortened and the southern bias removed)
 
f
lames and sports pre`erences (
planned to take about 10' time)
 
religion (
quite short)
 
sense of place (
an experimental one he's been testing out in
 
various forms for some years)
 
Rooney and co. would like to meet with us during the morning of May 21
 
to work out methods of cooperation amk to our mutual benefit.
 I am
 
writing him a letter today with a festival schedule and a brief statement
 
of the various festival sections and research programs.
 I recommend that
 
we all meet with him at 1
0:00 a
.m. and will propose this.
 In the meantime
 
we might try to think about his ideas.
 I did tell him that we rarely
 
set up "booths" but he seems to be entirely flexible in his approach.

The Society f
or the North American Cultural
, Survey has just been g
iven
 
an unparalled opportunity to collect data on r
egional d
ifferences i
n people's
 
a
ttitudes, preferences, t
astes and behavior.  We h
ave been g
iven s
pace a
t the
 
Smithsonian I
nstitution's F
estival of American Folklife s
cheduled for Washington,
 
U
.C., June 1
6-August 8
.  According to the Smithsonian e
stimates, the Festival
 
w
ill probably a
ttract over 20 m
illion visitors.  We w
ill be able to interview
 
and c
irculate questionnaires to a sampling of the visitors, recruit s
upport
 
and membership for SNAGS, and display existing i
nformation on American regions.
 
We need your help!  The most vital need is for volunteers to work in
 
the Regional Americans segment of the Festival.  At l
east one professional
 
must be on duty (
to speak with visitors and coordinate data
. collection) at a
ll
 
times.  The Festival is i
n operation Wednesday through Sunday from 1
1:00 A
.M.
 
to 5
:00 P
.M.  We would prefer that you volunteer for a one week s
tint but
 
even a day will do.  Volunteers will have an opportunity to work c
losely with
 
the regional representatives and performers sponsored by the Festival.  They
 
too should be able to provide a wealth of data.
 
The Smithsonian will provide a number of people to help with the question-
naires and interviewing but there i
s s
till a p
lace for i
nterested undergraduate
 
and graduate s
tudent workers.  Internship credit can be made available from
 
Oklahoma State University if desired.
 
The Smithsonian Institution has arranged accomodations a
t Georgetown
 
University.
 Room, meals, and transportation to and from the Mall will cost
 
$
18.00 per day.  We hope that you will be able to obtain some financial support
 
from your i
nstitution to engage in this research.  There is a possibility that
 
the Society w
ill be able to provide some funds (
ex post facto) should the mem-
bership a
nd donations drive be as s
uccessful as we anticipate.
 
We need to have the
 
P
lease call me, Tweedie,
 
or me during the evening
 
volunteer roster solidified as soon as possible.
 
or Carney here - 405-372-6211 extension 59S or 345,
 
405-377-5651 to set up your schedule.
 
If you have s
lides, wall maps or o
ther i
tems you wish to display a
t the
 
Festival please send them to Wilbur Zelinsky, Department of Geography, Penn-
sylvania State University, State College, Pennsylvania 1
6802.
 
We will be refining the questionnaires at the Bowling Green meeting.
 
Current plans call for data collection on foodways, games and sports, religion,
 
music, ethnicity and regional identity.  If you wish to devise a questionnaire
 
on another topic for consideration a
t Bowling Green please do s
o.  The Smith-
sonian format calls for "five minute" i
tems a
lthough there can be more than
 
one questionnaire on a g
iven topic.
 
This i
s a geographic data collection chance of a l
ifetime.  Please l
et
 
us hear from you as soon as possible.
 
The following i
s a calendar i

each week of the Festival.  Perhaps "u. would l

isits
 
with this.
