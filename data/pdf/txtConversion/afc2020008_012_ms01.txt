Chuck Christman interviewed by Vyta Pivo on May 25, 2021 at the Lehigh Cement 
Company Plant in Evansville, Pennsylvania. The interview transcript has been edited for 
clarity.  
 
[00:00:00] 
 
Vyta Pivo: 
This is an interview for the occupational history archive, which is part of the 
Folklife Center at the Library of Congress, funded by the Archie Greene Fellowship. As part 
of this project, I'm interviewing cement workers in the Lehigh Valley, Pennsylvania, the 
birthplace of the modern cement industry in the United States. The recording and transcript 
will become part of the permanent collection at the Library of Congress. I am Vyta Pivo and 
today I'm speaking with Chuck Chrisman at the Lehigh Cement Company Plant in 
Evansville, Pennsylvania. And just to confirm, you, give me your permission to record the 
interview, is that correct?  
 
Chuck Christman: 
Yes.  
 
VP: 
Thank you so much. So, could you tell me your full name, your year of birth, and 
where you were born?  
 
CC: 
Charles Christman, 1963. I was born in Redding, Pennsylvania.  
 
VP: 
And that's just around the corner.  
 
CC: 
Yes. Yes. Actually, the water right behind you serves Redding, that’s our water 
supply right behind you, Lake Ontelaunee.  
 
VP: 
And did you grow up Redding?  
 
CC: 
Yes, I did. I grew up in Redding and I moved out Redding when I was 23 years old, 
moved out to the outskirts, it’s called Wyomissing, and moved to Singing Spring, then I 
moved to Paulsboro for a while. And now I'm in a place called Morrisville, Pennsylvania, 
which is about 20 minutes from here.  
 
VP: 
When did you first learn about cement and concrete?  
 
[00:01:34] 
 
CC: 
When I was younger, I used to do some fooling around with sidewalks, try to repair 
sidewalks and stuff like that, but I didn't get involved in the industry ‘till I was, 13 years ago, 
40, 45 years old? That's when I interviewed here first shift supervisor’s job.  
 
VP: 
What did you do before then?  
 
CC: 
I was a supervisor at a two plant in Sinking Spring. And before that I was at a place 
called Dana Corporation where we made truck frames and they closed up. And after they 
closed up, I went back to school and got my degree and started my career as a supervisor.  
 
VP: 
And so, what was your degree in?  
 
CC: 
Associates in electronics. And I've only used that for like a year because we had 
[unclear] back in 2001. I worked for a company called Gear and their electronics system just 
went down, everything, something just happened. Everything and they sold went back up and 
sold everything. So, everybody was looking for electronic technicians at the time then.  
 
VP: 
Had you have any experience working with concrete?  
 
[00:02:48] 
 
CC: 
No, I didn't. Nothing really, just doing a little bit of sidewalk work at home. That was 
it. But for here, where we go from the quarry to the bulk. So, we started out with stone from 
the quarry. We mix that with limestone and other additives and stuff like that. We pulverize it 
and we make the kill feed, kill feed goes through the kilns, and that makes clinker, clinker 
produces, we pulverize that, put some other limestone in, some fillers, some different 
chemicals and stuff, and we make our finished products which are I think we have 6 or 7 
finished products here.  
 
VP: 
What are the products?  
 
CC: 
We have a type 1-2, it’s regular cement. We have 1S 40, which is what they call 60-
40, it’s 60 percent clinker, 40 percent slag. We have a full slag. We have two oil wells, ones 
that are oil well G and oil well A and we have mace and type 3. So, mace, we don't do in 
bulk. Everything else we do in bulk except the mace, we only do bag. I think when we bought 
the Essroc plant, which is the Nazareth plant, we gave them the mace business. We have a lot 
of it, so they just combine the two of them because it was taking up storage here. Plus, we 
were getting the OWA and OWG material to start selling, so. 
 
VP: 
So, you started as a shift supervisor? 
 
CC: 
Yep. Yeah, I was a shift supervisor here for 4 years and I applied for the maintenance 
supervisor. I was a maintenance supervisor probably 3.5-4 years, and a position opened up in 
the shipping department and since I was doing most [unclear] work anyway, I figure I might 
as well just go and do it. A little less stress for myself, let's put it that way.  
 
VP: 
So, what year did you start shift supervisor?  
 
CC: 
July 14th, 2008.  
 
VP: 
And can you describe what the job entailed?  
 
[00:04:52] 
 
CC: 
You were, you were a plant manager on the weekends, off shifts, you did a rotating 
shift of seven days on and you'd have two or three days off and then you did that for twenty 
eight days and then you had a long weekend. You were in charge of everything. You were in 
charge of the kills, the raw mills, the finish mills, shipping, everything. You were in charge of 
it all. I mean, day shift you had support from the maintenance and electrical gangs. But when 
I was on shift, I had an electrical person and a maintenance person. So, we [unclear] we had a 
breakdowns, anything like that, we took care of what we could until we could get the next 
day when shift would come out. I mean, until the maintenance people came out or sometimes 
they had to call people out just to get stuff running because a lot of times, we work 365 days 
a year or so, the kilns got to stay running, the mills got to stay running.   
 
VP: 
So, how did your previous jobs prepare you for this position?  
 
CC: 
Just dealing with people, deal with people is the biggest thing. I was lucky when I 
came here because, like I said, I worked at a place called Dana, and when I started out here, I 
think three of the guys that were on my crew worked at Dana, so I knew them already. So, it 
was really easy transition from what I was doing to where I was going to now. And they 
helped me. They were all in the, we were all in the union there. We were all workers and 
friends. So, worked out really well. But they came here right like in 2000/2001. I went back 
to school and got my associates and then things didn't work out some places. So, I came here 
and applied and took a shift supervisor job.  
 
VP: 
Did you know they were working here?  
 
CC: 
One of the guys I did, but not didn't realize how many guys were working here ‘till I 
came in for the first interview. 
 
VP: 
Did you talk to them about what their experience was here? 
 
CC: 
No, I didn’t ask them at all. I just figured it was, it was some different in life. I mean, 
it was going to be a definite life change for my wife and myself because it's rotating shift and 
stuff like that. You only really have off one weekend a month or so, but it was worth it. 
Definitely worth it.  
 
VP: 
How did you adjust to, like, your family life to accommodate the new schedule?  
 
CC: 
Well, it was just my wife and myself, so my kids were all grown up. So. it was fairly 
easy that way. But she just had to do some stuff on her own. And there was no sports or 
anything anymore for the kids. So, that wasn't that hard. I mean, some of the younger, the 
younger guys doing it, I don't know how they do it. You know, supporting, trying to do stuff 
with their kids on rotating shift and stuff. But I was where I had to work for third shift for a 
long time, so that was easy for me to adjust to that. It was actually tougher under the day 
shift.  
 
VP: 
So, the third shift is the night shift? 
 
CC: 
Yeah, the third shift is the night shift, 11PM-7AM, yeah.   
 
VP: 
So, were there particular things that you learned about the cement industry?  
 
CC: 
Oh, my God, I learned so much. I mean, I know my first like three years, we have to 
review every year yourself, you have to self-review yourself and stuff like that. And every 
year, I mean, I just learn more and more. But I became hands on, which was nice. Like I said, 
my unit 6, who is my repairman. He would let me go with him and learn stuff with him. And 
if they needed help and you did it to him because we're, you know, you're on shift. You've 
got a crew of like 8 guys. So, you've got to help each other out because if not, somebody's 
going to be some get hurt, something could happen. Who knows? But you get involved with 
everything. So that helped me a lot with the plant, which helped me when I went to 
maintenance too. So, I mean, the guys knew me and stuff like that. And you give them a 
hand, they appreciate it, you know, because you show them a little appreciation, they give 
right back to you.  
 
VP: 
So, what was most surprising to you about the cement industry? It was a new field for 
you.   
 
[00:08:46] 
 
CC: 
The kiln, the kiln was the biggest thing. I mean, 500 feet of round steel and what, 
what you're putting into it and what comes out of it is pretty amazing. So, I just that I learned 
a lot about the mills and stuff like that, how the finance and stuff. But it's just it's all amazing. 
It's very dirty though. If you don't like getting dirty, it's not a place to work.  
 
VP: 
So, did your wife have to do more cleaning as a result?  
 
CC: 
No, we have uniforms here, so no. 
 
VP: 
You don’t bring any home. 
 
CC: 
No, I don't bring it. I see, sometimes you inhale because if you're stupid and forget to 
wear your mask or something when you're out, you might inhale some. If you have a like a 
choke or something like that, you get a lot of dusting. So, that's the only way you really took 
any it home.  
 
VP: 
So, how did you get into your second job now that you have? 
 
CC: 
I was in maintenance. I just, when I was younger and like I said, I was hands-on and 
they seen how I guess they like how I worked when I was on shift and how we get stuff done 
and stuff like that. So, I was, I think, a big plus. Plus, then the other main supervisor at the 
time, him and I became pretty good friends and he wanted to work with me, so and he was 
showed me a lot too, so. But the maintenance guys showed me a lot also too. I mean we go 
into separators and stuff like that. I really didn't know anything about them. But you learn a 
lot when you're working with these guys and you actually give them a hand on stuff, you 
really learn a lot.  
 
VP: 
What are the separators?  
 
CC: 
Separators are, they feed material into, like stone, like we have raw mill separators. It 
feeds like stones like you see one inch, two inch, three inch stones and that it beats them 
around and it separates the fines to the stone. And actually the stones will go back down in 
and the fines will go out to your kill feed. But whatever is not kill feed material won't suck up 
into where it goes to the pump, it'll go right back down in the mills and they'll beat around 
there again and goes out the ex of the mill and back to the separator again, just like the circle 
of life. That's what it is for a, for a rock.  
 
VP: 
So, is that one of the trickier tools to maintain?  
 
CC: 
Oh, yes, they are. Yeah. Oh, yeah. You have to because they have a set of blades and 
stuff like that. And if you have, like sometimes they have holes in the separators and they'll 
get stone and it makes a mess for the guys with the kill feed because you could start an area 
and it won’t flow properly and doesn't burn properly, because it doesn't, it burns the feed but 
it doesn't burn the stones. So, which causes a quality problem.  
 
VP: 
So, what does a typical day for you look like? 
 
[00:11:35] 
 
CC: 
Right now? Getting around 6 o'clock and I have to do my reports. I check, you check 
reports, make sure we don't have any issues last night. We do a lot of rail out of here right 
now. So, I see what you guys did for rail cars for the night. Check what our numbers are from 
yesterday, our shipping numbers. More or less get that started. And we have a teams meeting 
just to go over there the day before the third shift would happen, are there any issues. And we 
pass on what we're going to do for the day and that starts my day. Then I give my safety talks 
to my guys and I have two crews, I have a packed house crew and I have bulkloaders. 
Bulkloaders are the ones that load the tanker trucks and the packed house is a packed 
material. So, I start out and I go from there on. I usually have to check my rail car numbers, 
stuff like that. But rail has really picked up for us. We've, when I first took over the job, I 
wasn’t doing any rail and this past year we’ve probably had done already, this year I've done 
150 railcars, if not more, probably more than that. We were supporting Brookhaven up 
towards New York and they were taking between 16 and 30 cars a week, so.  
 
VP: 
What are they building up there?  
 
CC: 
I have no idea. That's just the terminal. We just send it to them. They just unload it 
and send it back to us. I'm not sure if they fill up a tanker, sometime figure to fill up a boat. I 
don't know if it's as, if the terminal does that or not. I never been at a terminal. 
 
VP: 
That’s amazing.  
 
CC: 
Yeah, it's, it's really amazing.  
 
VP: 
Do you get a lunch break?  
 
CC: 
Yeah. When I, when I get a chance, I when I was on shift eight when you had a 
chance to eat, I mean that's you're there for eight, nine hours and it's when you get a break, I 
mean we usually take by guys like a pack let's take lunch between 11-11:30. And I usually try 
to take something in, but I help them out to their feed issues or anything like that, or we have 
what they call safe racks of the bulk silos and they’re safe cages that come down on top of a 
trailer so the drivers can go out on their trucks and open their lids and stuff like that. A lot of 
times that's right near my office. A lot of times I'll hear the, we have alarms on them, and I'll 
hear the alarm going on forever. And then I get up and have to help somebody out because 
they miss some lining or something like that. That's a big problem over there. That's probably 
one of the bigger problems we have at the bulk silos, the misalignment of the safe racks.  
 
VP: 
So, what happens then? 
 
[00:14:10] 
 
CC: 
They just they won't be able to operate and they won't even open it. There's safety 
gates on them. And what happens if they're not lined up properly, doesn’t push the arms up, 
which releases the gates so you have to go out and help them get the gate rack back up again, 
which is all there, but get up and get the rack back up again and get them realigned. But I 
mean one of our plants, probably the safest ones with safe racks, you know, come this stuff a 
lot of money in these because we had some issues with drivers that fell, unfortunately. Before 
I was over here, we lost a driver, fell off the top of the trailer and plunged, that was it for him. 
But I know a lot of drivers I talk to, we probably have the best, the safest racks around 
because, yeah, they all got to go home to their family every night.  
 
VP: 
So, what do you think is the most challenging part of the job?  
 
CC: 
The most challenging part for me right now is probably the drivers. Driver, you get a 
lot of different drivers. I mean, we get we have drivers are here every day. Then we have 
drivers that have come in from Brookland or something like that, and the language barrier, 
following the safety rules. I mean, I have a picture of a guy, it's probably three feet wide, six 
foot high, and the driver's seat, they're coming in and he tells them all their safety equipment 
they're required to wear and they don't look at it or they say they don't see it. We give them 
the safety video when they come in and tells them what they're supposed to wear. But that's 
part of the hardest thing is to have them wear their PPE.  
 
VP: 
Why do you think they don't wear it?  
 
CC: 
They don't want to. They just think they don't have to. I mean, we have, we have rules 
and we have to follow rules from MSAH, our safety association, we have to follow the rules. 
And part of the rules is that drivers have to have pants on, boots on, helmets, glasses, stuff 
like that. And right now it's getting warm out, the drivers want to come in with just shorts on 
and they want to give my guys a hard time about it, so. It's all for their safety, it's only for 
their safety. I mean, that's what it is. They don't see it that way. We're just being a pain.  
 
VP: 
Do you get different reactions during different seasons of the year when the weather 
changes?  
 
CC: 
Yea, we have 12, tankers get slippery. So, I get reactions from my guys because we 
have some of the product, we have to put baskets in the trailers before we load them and if 
there's ice on our way, I won’t let my guys get out there and then the drivers are complaining 
that hey, were supposed get the basket. It's like you don't clean your trailer off, you're not 
getting the basket. So, summertime just hot that the drivers want to come in in their shorts. 
And that's mostly about it, really.  
 
VP: 
And so, how many warehouses do you manage as part of your job?  
 
CC: 
The packhouse and the bulk silos, that all I watch here.  
 
VP: 
And how many people work there? 
 
CC: 
I have 13 guys that work underneath me.  
 
VP: 
Is that a lower number?  
 
CC: 
That's, for me, that's about average for everybody else. I mean, shift [unclear] to a 
guy. I mean, it's maintenance probably has 10 to each of them, the supervisors.  
 
VP: 
Do you train them as well?  
 
CC: 
Yes, we do train them. Actually, I think three years ago we combined the two jobs, 
the bulk loading job and the packhouse job, and they made then a shipping utility, so we can 
utilize them for both positions if needed. If you guys are big, like the big jobs. But if we 
would need them, they could be able to do the other jobs, too. Like on a Saturday, if we need 
somebody to help us out doing stuff, I can ask, go through and ask for them to help us out and 
stuff like that.  
 
[00:17:32] 
 
VP: 
What would you say is your favorite part of the job?  
 
CC: 
My favorite part of the job, 3 o'clock Friday. No, favorite part of the job. I guess to 
have the guys appreciate what I do and I really appreciate what they do, and I let them know 
it all the time, and they do back. I mean, I have good crews. I really do.  
 
VP: 
Do you ever have kind of some personnel issues or some rebellion?  
 
CC: 
Oh, you always have personnel issues. Always. We have an attendance policy here 
and guys push it to the limit. I mean, I think eight, they’re fired. Seven is like the final 
warning or something like that. A lot of the problems that I have with guys over here is the 
attendance. And it's not the youngest guys and it's not the oldest guys. It's probably the guys 
in between like mid-40s. I mean, that's my biggest problem. Most of my write-ups are just, 
just, that, for 10 minutes.  
 
VP: 
So, what happens when they don't show up?  
 
CC: 
Well, I have to ask for overtime or we have to force, we call, we force guys if they 
have to, if the second shift guy would call off, we have to force, if we're not available to 
cover, we have to force one of the dayshift guys and hopefully somebody from third shift to 
come out for early. So, which doesn't make them happy, which then that makes him mad at 
those guys, you know, I mean, because a lot of guys want to do eight in the gate and get out 
of here, which I don't blame them.  
 
VP: 
Do you also communicate with your customers?  
 
CC: 
I talk to, I just talk to the truck drivers. I don't talk, most of them don't talk to any of 
the customers themselves. That's all sales. Sales does that.  
 
VP: 
And so, your truck drivers, are you involved in hiring them as well?  
 
CC: 
No, they're all outside, they're all outsourced. Oh, yeah. They come from different 
places. I mean, we have like Pensie Quality Carrier, Sophy's right up the road here. Valenzie, 
you'll see their green trucks are right outside of our property here, but they're all hired 
through somebody else. They just come in and get our cement and they deliver it wherever 
they need to go. I guess they're more like subcontractor.  
 
VP: 
What other types of jobs does the plant contract out for?  
 
CC: 
Well, we all clinker and stuff like that, which we know that truck drivers job, but 
that's like triaxles and stuff like that. They think they subcontract out sweeper, we subcontract 
maintenance work out, like for winter outages and stuff like that. The bigger jobs we 
subcontract out to a company called GNR, I think they're out of Indiana. We subcontract out 
for balancing, balancing fans and stuff like that, a lot of our building work we contract out to 
different companies.  
 
VP: 
So, do you work more autonomously or as part of a team?  
 
CC: 
I work for myself. That's why I took the job. That’s a major perk, yeah, but it's good 
and bad. I mean, it's good that when everything's done good, it's good. At 3 o'clock in the 
morning, there's an issue. I get a phone call. Yeah. I mean, that's it is what it is.  
 
VP: 
And so why do you like working on your own better?  
 
[00:21:24] 
 
CC: 
Because I have no one else to blame except myself. And I can, I like my guys. No, I 
mean I can pinpoint if there's a problem I can always direct when we find out where it was or 
something like that. And if there's just one person or if it's an area we need to work on, I can 
do that. Like I said, the only thing that's bad is when you get a phone call 3 o'clock in the 
morning, there's an issue or like I said, the attendance policy. One of the guys calls off at 
11:30 at night or 10 at night and you got to get coverage for 11 o'clock. And that's when I was 
on shift. That's when the shift supervisor used to do, like someone would call off and they 
would try to get somebody to come out. Well, since I did that or I know the pain it is, I more 
or less take it on by myself and think of what my we have overtime equalization. I try to 
figure out, I'm seeing my brain, what it says, who, who's next in line, or I can know who to 
call out so they don't get bothered with it. They have enough going on. I mean, they're run the 
whole plant. So, taking a half hour or so to call guys out, I take that burden off of them.  
 
VP: 
So, how often do you get phone calls?  
 
CC: 
It depends, there for a while I'd say quarterly. I have one guy, quarterly.  
 
VP: 
And it’s all connected to attendance? 
 
CC: 
Yes, yes. Yeah, he has a lot of [unclear]. It was always something else before Covid, 
but now he gets [unclear].  
 
VP: 
So yeah. How has Covid changed the work experience for you and your job?  
 
[00:22:50] 
 
CC: 
It changes a lot. I mean, the drivers, we ban drivers from go to the pack house, we 
don’t let them in our scale 4. And up at scales 1 and 2, we fill out their paperwork now. They 
used to fill out paperwork and hand it to us, now we take care of that, so. We're all anxious to 
get it off, get it out of the air.  
 
VP: 
So, it's more work for you?  
 
CC: 
Well, for them guys, not me, I just have to enforce it more, that's all.  
 
VP: 
So, are you the only person who's kind of managing them?  
 
CC: 
Yes, yes, yes. If there's an issue, it's on me. I find out what the issues are, stuff like 
that. But, I, like, the supervisors, they’ll watch guys at night for me and stuff like that. Like, 
they'll make sure my rail guys are doing their job at night and we wrap our palates because 
we don't have, what they have is a hooder, a thing called a hooder that goes over the top of 
the pallets and heat up. We don't do that. We do everything manually. We put the bags on 
manually. We have to stretcher that runs around, but that's all manual.  
 
VP: 
And you mentioned there's some kind of process of self-review? 
 
CC: 
Yeah, every once a year, we have to do a review on ourselves and our job, our job 
performances and stuff like that and [unclear] we've had over the year, stuff like that.  
 
VP: 
And this is for salary positions?  
 
CC: 
Salary, yes.  
 
VP: 
And hourly workers?  
 
CC: 
No, union guys don't do anything with that. No.  
 
VP: 
Why not?  
 
CC: 
Because they're the union probably. Yeah, they're in the same job. Yeah. I mean, they 
they do their performance thing when they're getting being trained and stuff like that, test 
train, stuff like that. But I mean they if they're not doing their jobs, we of course discipline 
them and stuff like that. That's a process of verbal and read and stuff like that. But most guys 
in their jobs know what to do.  
 
VP: 
How has the union responded to the Covid rules? 
 
[00:24:49] 
 
CC: 
Pretty good. Actually, my department was actually one of the better ones. I don't think 
I had, knock on wood, I have any cases of Covid for 13 guys. I had, I had maybe three guys 
had to quarantine at one time, but we were very lucky.  
 
VP: 
Do you have any challenges bringing in new people or hiring new workers?  
 
CC: 
That would be Noelle's question, but I believe we do. I think we do. Because you see, 
no one wants to get dirty anymore. That’s what is it. Now, I’m lucky I've received two 
younger guys with probably were hired within the last four or five years and I got two and 
they're very good workers. One, his father was a bulk loader, he’s a bulk loader for me and 
his son just applied here, he didn’t even tell us he applied here. Just got tired where he was 
working here, got an interview and he got very fortunate for only having a year service here. 
They got over my department. Nobody wanted the job, so. But he's a hard worker, very good. 
And these kids, they know the computers and stuff better than we do, which helps me out 
with printer problems and stuff like that.  
 
VP: 
 So, do you feel like workers that come with a family connection, they're more 
invested in the industry?  
 
CC: 
I think so, yes. Yes. I mean, I have, what I was telling you about it, Ellis he calls it 
Ellis Cement. His last name is Ellis. His name Mike, Mike Ellis. I think you have his sister 
Morris who has, yes. So that's his sister works here. His brother-in-law works here. His son 
works here. Actually, his nephew is going to be here for summer. Summer worker too. 
 
VP: 
So, that's so funny.  
 
CC: 
Yeah. Yeah. Well, so, Sue will tell you she has a lot of people work here too.  
 
VP: 
So, it's like a family business.  
 
[00:26:41] 
 
CC: 
Yeah, there is a lot of family. I mean that's what it seemed to be years ago. I mean, we 
had when I first started here with three mayor brothers who worked here, now they've all 
since retired. And it seems like a lot of them. I mean, one of our shift supervisor, his dad 
worked here, actually, I worked with him at the [unclear]. We have a father and son and a 
son-in-law work here. Yeah, there's a lot of, it's a lot of family. A lot of family.  
 
VP: 
Is that less common now or is it still happening?  
 
CC: 
It’s still it's still common now. It used to be really common years ago, but it's still 
common now.  
 
VP: 
So, do you feel left out sometimes?  
 
CC: 
Not at all. Not at all.  
 
VP: 
How do the workers build community at the plant?  
 
[00:27:33] 
 
CC: 
I just, they work together and they just I mean, they need they come in, they knew, a 
lot of times they go back to the old crews, how they used to be. They know they came in, 
they had a job to do and they got it done and they got on for the day or got on with their lives. 
They became a [unclear] work order for the day one need to get done. And they just did it. 
And the bad thing nowadays is here again, these younger guys in here, you're losing the older 
knowledge that we used to have. I mean, probably when I was in maintenance, we probably 
lost four or five guys that all a lot of knowledge, a lot of knowledge. And I mean, we only 
have probably one or two those guys who still have knowledge like that. And one guy 
actually works in a garage all the time. So, he's not out in the plant much. Another guy, he's 
getting up there in age. And there's actually another one, Sue’s husband, I just thought of 
him, too. He actually just moved on to a different position at the plant, he went to be 
electrician.  
 
VP: 
Is it a question of salary, that sort of or …?  
 
CC: 
No, no, it's he just he was on shift for a while. He was on shift for a long time. And he 
just wanted to get out of there. And when he was in maintenance, um, I think some changes 
in maintenance, he didn't care for anymore. Plus, people deal with an electrical gang. So, I 
think that's why he wanted to do that—different challenge.  
 
VP: 
So, you mentioned or I think automation seems to be a common challenge.  
 
CC: 
Automation. Yeah. Oh, yeah.  
 
VP: 
Is that something that you deal with as well? 
 
[00:29:05] 
 
CC: 
Oh, yeah. All of my machinery over at the packhouse is automated, so. But it's old. I 
mean just like I told you those kills, the Packers and stuff like that I have is old, where the 
lining that it goes down to put it on pallets and stuff is old. So, it's a challenge sometimes. I 
mean we did upgrade probably three years ago on rote packer and once here we have this 
company come in and service everything. And this past year, the guy that came in did some 
upgrades and now my machines run so fast, sometimes we have to take a bag out of the out of 
the sequence just to keep up with the palletized and stuff like that, which is a good thing.  
 
VP: 
Could you describe kind of just walking around the plant? It seems like there's a mix 
of new and old machinery and new and old technology.  
 
CC: 
It's mostly old. I mean, we, like I told you, we have to wrap pallets by hand, stuff like 
that. If you ever see our equipment and our equipment isn't the newest stuff, our dump truck, 
stuff like that. You look at our mills and stuff like that. We had, they have roll mills and stuff 
out there that crush a lot faster and a lot more times than we do. I mean, we're a, we use our 
500 foot kill, you go to some of these, you were at Nazareth today. They were five, I think it's 
five stage pre-heat which comes down and there kills probably half the size of ours. We feed 
tires, one of the nice things we do, we feed tires here and we put our tires in the middle of the 
kill. I guess he showed you that probably also. We are probably one of the only ones around 
here burns tires and we burn a lot of them too. That's just really old technology. It's nothing 
really, it feeds up in a belt system, hooks up [unclear]. And the upgrades we've done in the 
last couple of years, the only upgrades we have done is made, like, the forks longer to insert 
the tires and the kills and stuff like that. But that's I mean, how long has that technology been 
here? A long time.  
 
VP: 
So, how many tires do your burn at the plant?  
 
[00:31:21] 
 
CC: 
I could be wrong. I think it's between 5-6 thousand a day per kiln. So, probably 
between I say between 12 and 14 thousand tires. I don't know if you have Alex on your list or 
not, but he would know more and I would, I used to know it when I was on shift. But I really 
don't know it anymore. But that's what it probably is, probably about 12-14 thousand tires 
with both kilns running.  
 
VP: 
And so, and so you mentioned a lot of old technology. And how about new tools that 
the plant has integrated?  
 
[00:31:49] 
 
CC: 
Like, electrically, we've done a lot of stuff. They've done a lot of stuff like samplers. 
They're always doing upgrades like, before you have to turn off when you are up in arms 
control, you stop to flip switches and stuff to make stuff work. Now they can do everything 
with the computers and stuff like that. Most of the stuff is electronically or digitalize or 
whatever you want to call that through electricians. They've done all this up, the upgrades and 
stuff like that. So that's a lot of technology. I mean, there's still a lot in there. When you, years 
ago, we used to still burn coal, there's some bins in the back that they used to do something to 
feed in the kills. But I can’t remember what it was, just what we used to burn coal. But 
anyway, because of this black dust into the kill to not do something with the NOx or 
something like that.  
You're talking about technology, new technology. We've changed actually from coal 
to natural gas within the last 4 years, maybe 5 years. So, that was a big, big improvement. 
Yeah, it's a lot of money they put out for each. And you get two kills to do it, too. So, I mean, 
they're sticking money and stuff like that, which we need to go to natural gas and stuff like 
that. And for the emissions, they have to do it for the emissions, too. So, we used to do, we 
just have a headache when I was on maintenance, we used to have a thing was called the 
spider inside the kills in this NCAR, and it would spray ammonia there. It would just that to 
do some of the emissions. I think it was the NOx to keep the NOx down or something. We 
got to do it only in the summertime. So, but it was a lot of money to repair them. It was a lot 
of hassle to repair them. And ammonia wasn't cheap either, I believe. But they had to do it 
until they went to natural gas. I think they more or less stop using that.  
 
VP: 
So, have you had to take some training or some additional kind of schooling to, like, 
adjust to the new techniques? 
 
CC: 
They've given us and like for the ammonia and stuff like that, but mostly like the 
PCOs, stuff like that will do that, process control operators and central control, they do most 
of that stuff. I mean, when I was on shift, I went to 6 or 7 months of training. They sent us to 
our Union Bridge plant, which is in Maryland. We went there, three or four. We went up to 
Allentown to headquarters, and we dealt with like the kill engineers that were in charge of 
HTC and [unclear]. So, I mean, I had training, like that. I got to meet some guys of different 
plans to that was nice to get to talk about each other's problems and stuff like that. It was fun. 
We actually used to, we used to talk to each other for a while, but it's broken off. There's only 
one guy in the town in Rain, California plant that I even talk to anymore, so. Some moved on, 
stuff like that.  
 
VP: 
Yeah, but why the shift? It seems like a productive exchange.  
 
CC: 
Yeah. Yeah, it was nice. It was. Like I said, I told you about the role models and stuff 
like that. That's what I learned about role models and what they produced, but a lot more than 
ours do. And, but when you have downtime and stuff like that, it's major work, too.  
 
VP: 
So. So, why do you think the communication is not working in the same way 
anymore?  
 
CC: 
I think guys just left, they moved on. I mean, one or two of them left the industry 
completely. So, I mean, that's just, we used to email each other all the time. But yeah, as time 
goes on, we forget about each other and, you know, we got to work on stuff and you get new 
people here you're talking to and stuff like that and it's like, oh, you forget about them. So, 
actually, the one guy I used to him, he used to he's in Redding, California, and his son went 
up to college up towards Pittsburgh and they would come every year for the homecoming. 
And I used to, my wife and I would go up and see them and spend the weekend with them 
and stuff like that, see his son play football. So, I was nice. With the other guys, like I said, 
they were all from California, Indiana, different places. Glen Falls.  
 
VP: 
So, how long do your project typically last?  
 
CC: 
It depends, what it is. Most my stuff I can get done in a day. I have a list of stuff, but 
then we have stuff for my tech to do and stuff like that. Sometimes it's longer than a day. I 
mean we always have a list of stuff to do and stuff breaking down all the time. That's the 
biggest thing, we're fighting fires most of the time, so.  
 
VP: 
Is there a particular project that you can think of that we're really proud to work on, or 
really excited to work on?  
 
CC: 
Yeah, it was actually the coal mill fans we put. We downsized our coal mill fans when 
I was in the plant itself, when I was a maintenance and I mean, the ones we had were 
monsters. They were probably 8 foot by 3 foot wide and the ones we went to were probably 6 
foot by maybe 10 inches wide. So, getting them in there, that was a big project I liked when I 
was on maintenance.  
 
VP: 
How did you get it in there?  
 
CC: 
It wasn't easy, but what it is at the time, mostly the time to do the stuff. I mean, we 
had winter outage, and then you set up the we set up an outside contractor come and doing 
stuff like that. So, but it wasn't easy. It was easy to cut the old one out, but put a new one in 
because of room. I mean, the plant’s, it's old and a lot of stuff you can't move anymore. So a 
lot of stuff was put there before they build walls up and stuff like that. 
 
VP: 
That’s amazing 
 
CC: 
Yeah, it is amazing.  
 
VP: 
So, in wrapping up the interview, is there something that you like to share or comment 
on a question or a thought that I haven't asked or brought up?  
 
CC: 
No, not really. Yeah. Did you, well, you say about environment stuff like you know, 
we do burn alternative fuels, we did burn DPS when I first started, which is dried up human 
waste, but that we got the permits and everything like that, but it never took off. When I first 
started, we burnt woodchips, then we switched. Like I told you, the alternative fuels, which is 
like ground up rugs, plastics, stuff like that, stuff’s great when it works and a lot of times we 
have a lot of choking and feed issues. That's the biggest thing now.  
 
VP: 
So. So, are you involved in that?  
 
CC: 
I was involved, yeah. When I was in maintenance, I was involved in that. I learned a 
lot over there too with the equipment, stuff like that. But I learned how, how hydraulic trucks 
work, I didn't realize that they've actually had hydraulic walking beds that walk the material 
up and stuff like that.  
 
VP: 
So how would you unchoke the machines?  
 
CC: 
Oh, you, it depends where it chokes. You have to figure out where it is. That's first. 
The hardest part is trying to figure out is that elbows and stuff like that, you just more or less 
knew from years of experience that where to start looking at and go from there.  
 
VP: 
Did you have to climb into some tight spots? 
 
CC: 
Uh, yeah. Out in the burner, you would have to, that’s about it. Everything else is 
outside. It's an outside building four walls and has pipes that come out and that's where it 
usually chokes outside.  
 
VP: 
Well, that's wonderful. Thank you so much for the chat.  
 
CC: 
No problem.
