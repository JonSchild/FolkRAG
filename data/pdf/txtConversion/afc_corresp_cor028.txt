[Letter from Harold Spivacke to Carita Doggett Corse,
September 6, 1939]
Sept. 6, 1939
Dr. Carita Doggett Corse State Director, Federal Writers' Project 49 West Duval Street
Jacksonville, Florida
Dear Dr. Corse:
We received the records and they are being inspected at the present moment. Since I am
leaving town tomorrow morning, I shall not be able to send my comments on these songs
until my return, but I should like to take this opportunity to commend you on the excellence
and clarity of the reports you have been sending us.
Sincerely yours, Harold Spivacke Chief, Division of Music
