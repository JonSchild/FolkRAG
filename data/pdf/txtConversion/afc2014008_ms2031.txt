 She

She taught me how to sew,  for example.
 I remember sitting with
 
her rag bag that contained scraps of material from all the
 
clothes mother had made for us and sort of folding doll clothes
 
out of them.
 
But then I had to learn how to do it right.
 My mother was a
 
great believer in that.
 She gave me a Latin motto  (she gave all
 
us children different mottos).
 Mine was  "Faciendo ediscere
 
facere" which means  "By doing you learn to do"  and she would
 
tell me over and over,  "by reading you learn to read,"  "by
 
running you learn to run,"  "by sewing you learn to sew."

But then I had to  learn how to do it right.
 My mother was a
 
great believer in that.
 She gave me a Latin motto  (she gave all
 
facere" which means  "By doing you learn to do"  and she would
 
tell me over and over,  "by reading you learn to read,"  "by
 
running you learn to run,"  "by sewing you learn to sew."
 So  I
 
learned how to work her old foot treadle Singer sewing machine.
 
She gave me the front page of the Dallas Morning News  and -1
 
- 
I
 
- 2 -
newsprint columns and around the photographs until I learned
 
just how to sew a straight line and turn a neat corner.
 And
 
then I had to learn how to embroider -
-
 because that's what all
 
little girls did in my part of the country -
-
 at least,  little
 
Anglo girls like me.
 All of my friends,  like me,  knew how to do
 
the French knot and the outline stitch and the lazy daisy and
 
the feather stitch.
 
And then every November,  my mother and I would go to the
 
dime store and I would get to pick out the presents I was going
 
to make for Christmas.
 In those days you could buy dresser
 
scarves or table napkins or bridge table covers or pillow cases
 
that had designs stencilled on them with blue dots.
 And
 
"embroidering" was to cover those blue dots with French knots
 
and lazy daisies in different colors so it would turn out to be
 
a special present that you yourself had made.
 
So after I had picked out the item I wanted to embroider for
 
my sister or my mother or my great aunt,  I would go to the
 
embroidery thread counter and pick out the colors.
 There was
 
always white embroidery thread,  I remember,  and lots of pastels
 
 
I
 
- 3
 
-
-
 pale green,  pink,  lavender,  yellow,  blue and sometimes black
 
and sometimes red.
 I agonized.
 One year I remember coming home
 
with red and black and green and pink and lavender and white,
 
and my sister said,  "Honey, you don't want to use that red and
 
black;  they won't blend.
 You want it to blend and be pretty."
 
And I thought it might be pretty,  but I tried it and it wasn't.
 
It didn't blend -
-
 and I had to pick it all out and start again.
 
Now when I remember what was in the ragbag -
-
 scraps from my
 
dresses and the shirts and blouses mother made for the others,
 
and her own dresses and aprons and good pieces from father's old
 
business shirts -
-
 those pieces of cloth weren't scarlet or
 
magenta or orange.
 They were lavender and aquamarine and pale
 
blue,  and they were solid colors or small prints.
 I guess you
 
could say we were conservative.
 And every once in a while my
 
mother would load up the ragbag into the car
 
see the quilt  lady who lived about two miles
 
during the depression and everybody did what
 
and we would go to
 
from us.
 This was
 
they knew how to do
 
to make a few cents,  and this  lady really knew how to make
 
quilts.
 Mother and she would look over all the scraps,  and she
 
would get out all her patterns from the newspapers,  and they
 
 
I
 
would decide which pattern would look best with the material we
 
had.
 The idea was,  you see,  not to have to buy material;  nobody
 
could afford that in those days.
 But this  lady could take all
 
our old bits and pieces and make absolutely beautiful quilts out
 
of them.
 Mother always said she was a real artist at her work.
 
So all the quilts on our beds turned out to be blendy. 
They
 
were made out of the clothes we wore and the colors we had
 
chosen and the aesthetic principles we had learned -
-
 neat
 
corners,  straight  lines,  balanced curves,  precise workmanship,
 
unemphasized dividing lines,  subtle color graditions.
 It's
 
actually a wonderful system -
-
 around the world it has produced
 
some beautiful effects from 19th century Italian paintings to
 
British flower gardens to Chinese porcelain to east Texas quilts.
 
But,  although the quilt lady,  as everybody I knew called
 
her, was an artist,  it gradually became clear that I wasn't.
 
Sewing just didn't really interest me.
 I learned those things
 
that an east Texas  little girl needed to know but that was it.
 
I didn't become an artist.
 On the other hand those aesthetic
 
principles  I learned as a a child have never  left me.

squares I' m putting together for a baby blanket -
-
 and I gigg1
 
a bit sometimes when I look at them,  for with the world of color
 
and gaiety to choose from I picked out white and pale green and
 
the sweetest pale yellow to make those squares out of,  because I
 
thought they would just work up so pretty... 
Now this is a very homely story,  and I hope that many of you
 
recognize it and can understand its understated power.
 But we
 
have not explored it all the way yet.
 Notice,  for example,  that
 
although my mother considered it essential for me to learn the
 
principles of sewing,  she did not consider it necessary to show
 
me the rudiments of basketry or of pottery.
 What you do not
 
learn or experience marks you as distinctively as what you do.
 
I' m sorry to say that as a child I didn't know any Mexican or
 
Black or Indian children who were neighbors to me in east Texas,
 
but I can tell you that it is  likely they would have had
 
instruction in different aesthetic activities than I.
 A recent
 
research project in the county of Mount Pleasant,  South Carolina
 
where ancient African basketry tradition connected with rice
 
growing is still alive and thriving indicates that every single
 
African
 
- 6
 
American man, woman and child past the lap baby stage in that
 
community can make a basket.  I can't.
 I don't really have any
 
idea how to start.
 Basket making was not part of the tradition
 
in which I was brought up.
 How sad -
-
And then consider the various color palettes that are in use
 
around the world.
 American Indians often emphasize clear
 
primary colors each of which represents a different direction -
-
east,  north,  south, west,  up,  down;  they point a way and make
 
distinctions between elements rather than shading things
 
together.
 Black quilters often emphasize movement and energy
 
with brilliant color-soaked contrasts that almost vibrate to the
 
eye:  magenta and lime green and sulphur yellow and lots of black
 
to set it all off.
 The colorful visual playfulness of many
 
Mexican traditions depends on the use of shocking pink and
 
scarlet and peacock blues.
 The folk arts coordinator for the
 
state of Arizona told me a few years ago that he had noticed
 
many of the local pinata makers were producing snow white and
 
pale pink and blue pinatas;  he thought this odd and enquired if
 
a new fashion had developed.
 No,  he was told,  the only Arizona
 
paper company that carried tissue paper had decided that they
 
- 7 -
-
would just sell to the big department stores in future so they
 
had cut back the colors to those that "most people"  (anglos)
 
like.
 I
' m happy to tell you that when I last enquired,  our
 
coordinator had a small room in his house full of industrial
 
rolls of purple and orange and deep pink tissue paper where any
 
Tucson pinata maker could come and buy a few yards of his own
 
aesthetic selection.
 
So far I have been trying to demonstrate how folk arts
 
emerge from the aesthetic patterns expressive of particular folk
 
groups,  groups that define themselves as themselves by virtue of
 
sharing the same ethnicity,  location,  occupation,  language,
 
religion or other common factor.
 Now every person in a folk
 
group is exposed to  (or you might say,  "learns")  the aesthetic
 
pattern and carries it with him as a point of aesthetic
 
reference the rest of his or her life.
 This is why the current
 
emphasis on "multi-culturalism"  in the arts agenda,  as badly
 
defined and confusing as the discussion so often is,  is of such
 
vital importance.
 Every individual,  regardless of the aesthetic
 
system of her family or community,  needs to see that system
 
treated with respect and appreciation and genuine understanding,
 
I
 
- 8
 
not just lip service.
 When this happens,  the individual can
 
allow himself to be open to other aesthetic experiences and
 
become gladdened by variety rather than frightened or angered.
 
Each new aesthetic exposure then serves to broaden and deepen
 
our personalities,  making us more wise,  more humane,  more subtle.
 
It is astonishing how deep these early experiences  lie and
 
how potent they are.
 Some years ago I was attending a concert
 
that presented a sampling of the musicians scheduled to appear
 
at a large multi-ethnic festival in Los Angeles.
 There were
 
scores of musical performances from all around the world;  kilted
 
Scots bagpipers marched down the central aisle, African drummers
 
thundered from the stage, mariachi orchestras blazed and
 
trumpeted,  gospel choirs filled the enormous hall with
 
sonorities.
 I was in my element,  making knowledgeable remarks
 
to my companions
thrilling to each extraoardinary set of
 
sounds.
 The whole thing dragged on for hours,  each performance
 
more special than the last until almost at the end three
 
slightly bedraggled looking men carrying a banjo,  a guitar and a
 
string bass shambled out on the stage,  fussed around rather
 
unprofessionally for a minute or two and then struck up "Red
 
Wing."
 And my heart absolutely melted.
 The most extraordinary
 
- 9
 
sense of total well-being came over me,  I was comforted,  I was
 
secure,  I was home,  that was my song.
 And I realized,  to my
 
great embarrassment,  that if I had seen a copy of the program
 
ahead of time,  Red Wing would have come down towards the last of
 
my list of favorites.
 I had moved so far away from my roots I
 
had forgotten where they lay.
 But my roots hadn't forgotten;
 
there they were ready to remind me who I am and where I come
 
from .
..
 
So that,  ultimately,  is what multi-culturalism is about,
 
making sure that everybody on the one hand gets to check back to
 
his own roots every once in a while for comfort and dignity and
 
presence and on the other hand gets a chance to revel in the
 
glories of the inventiveness that other cultures have to share
 
with us.
 It's a nice system; we just have to keep on trying to
 
ensure that everybody gets their turn.
 And that the quality
 
stays high.
 
FQ
-t remember my quilt lady as compared to me as a child a
i.
 
an adult.
 She was an artist,  I wasn't.
 And everybody around
 
knew that.
 If you had asked anybody in our county who was a
 
-
 10 -
 
good quilt maker,  every one would have mentioned this lady's
 
name;  they could also have told you -
-
 depending on who you
 
asked -
-
 who was a good blues picker,  or who knew the whole of
 
"las posadas."
 Evervbods in a folk group knows the traditional
 
art forms and has experienced their basic aesthetic principles
 
and internalized them,  but this does not mean that every member
 
of that group is an artist.
 Artists are special members of any
 
community and must be cherished as such.
 
It's the same in any art form from anywhere.
 I once wrote
 
that it probably takes 10,000 little girls learning to play "Fur
 
Elise" or the Happy Farmer or whatever your first piano tune was
 
on the piano to produce one Dame Myra Hess  (or any other piano
 
virtuoso).
 Every individual artist regardless of art form or
 
origin emerges out of and depends upon a massive support system
 
of elders who have conveyed the "rudiments"  at an early age,  of
 
teachers who recognize and polish budding talent,  of other
 
artists who compare and compete,  of promoters who present and
 
exhibit,  of audiences who applaud and buy,  of critics who scold
 
and praise.
 All of these are necessary to support just one
 
artist.
 Which is more important to a mountain -
-
 the top or the
 
bottom,  the peak or the bedrock?
 
Actually,  the longer I work with folk arts,  the more it
 
seems to me the problems in folk arts are exactly the same as
 
the problems in all art forms whether you call them classical or
 
fine or whatever.
 All artists have pretty much the same needs.
 
They need to be heard or seen or experienced,  they need their
 
work to get out into the world.
 They need audiences, whether
 
large or small,  but they thr-i ed educated and sophisticated
 
audiences -
 that is,  audiences that understand the rudiments of
 
the particular art form and won't be expecting excitement where
 
serenity is the order of the art or blendy colors where visual
 
contrast is the desideratum.
 (I keep remembering the Anglo
 
county social workers in the deep south who used to give Black
 
quilters color wheels in an attempt to teach them how to make
 
their quilts blendy instead of vibrant.
 They didn't realize you
 
could as well  look across the color wheel for contrast as side
 
by side for harmony.)
 
There are some other simple needs that all artists folk and
 
-
 12 -
 
fine share -
-
 they need to have their work included in public
 
school curricula so that all children can be exposed to their
 
special aesthetic principles,  they need to have their property
 
and personal rights protected from exploitation,  they need to be
 
able to make a little money at their art form from time to
 
time.
 Finally they need to be criticized;  they need to have
 
their work held to high standards,  so long as,  of course,  the
 
standards are the standards of that aesthetic system.
 For that
 
you need a corps of aficionados,  people who have steeped
 
themselves in the particular aesthetic system, who love it and
 
defend it.
 That is why the Folk Arts Program insists that folk
 
arts projects need both community and outside experts on the
 
particular art form;  our folk arts coordinators,  like your fine
 
Ray Brassieur,  spend much of their time making sure that
 
qualified expertise is involved in every major folk arts
 
project.
 Just stop and think a moment -
-
 you wouldn't put on an
 
important exhibit of 20th century painting or a brand new
 
Shakespeare festival without having it put together by a trained
 
art curator on the one hand and a drama expert on the other.
 
It s just the same with folk arts.
 You and the folk artist
 
needs the help of somebody that understands Viet Namese
 
embroidery or Jewish cantorial vocal style, t

By the way,  that built in ever present concern for quality,
 
for the refinement and elegance of traditional authentic styles,
 
techniques and repertoires is a major characteristic of the folk
 
arts movement.
 I mention this because people often don't seem
 
to realize there are quality standards in folk arts,  possibly
 
because they can't visualize a critic that isn't wearing a three
 
piece suit.
 But in a chat with Charley Walden and Gordon McCann
 
this morning they pointed out the toughest fiddle critics are
 
other fiddlers,  and I know Mrs. Murphy,  as sweet and gentle a
 
lady as she is,  agreed with my mother's position that  "you have
 
to do it right."
 It's quality first and participation second in
 
the folk arts.
 That seems kind of mean perhaps,  but that is the
 
true way it is.
 I can't tell you how many musicians have told
 
me their daddy threatened to whip them if he caught them
 
touching his guitar or dulcimer.
 It wasn't until the child had
 
snuck around and learned in spite of the difficulties put in his
 
way that he was accepted as a,$,artist.
 
And this is one of the distinguishing features between folk
 
arts and the community arts movement.
 A good community arts
 
program,  in my experience,  rejoices in what is there within a
 
particular population -
-
 or what is ready to be developed.
 Its
 
-
 14 -
 
primary goal,  however,  tends to be participation,  community
 
involvement.
 It tries to create a more joyful surround by
 
virtue of involving as many people as possible in the making and
 
receiving and distributing of art -
-
 all kinds of art:  folk,
 
popular and fine -
-
 setting up community theaters,  community
 
choruses,  community art galleries where openness is the order of
 
the day, where everybody can come and try their hand.
 It's a
 
great idea and I support it to the fullest.
 My main concern
 
with the community arts movement is that too often they overlook
 
their resident folk artists,  their local traditional arts.
 They
 
bring in too many peop e,\ please include the local folk artists
 
So then what are the big differences between folk arts and
 
the other kinds of arts -
-
 either popular or fine?
 I
've been
 
talking almost entirely about factors they all share in common,
 
and the differences are really pretty tricky.
 I think I' m
 
pretty brave to go this far,  but I do think that I can make one
 
useful suggestion:
 folk arts emerge from a group of people who
 
share something in common and they speak especially therefore of
 
and to that particular group.
 And that is their primary reason
 
A-
 
-
 15 -
 
for being.
 Other people can listen or look,  but they come
 
second.
 Popular and fine arts on the other hand try to speak
 
across cultural or geographic boundaries to much larger
 
audiences,  to everybody,  and so their message is often more
 
diluted.  Both are wonderful objectives; we need both; we need to
 
maintain them in balance.
 
When I started worrying over folk arts across the nation
 
some 15 years ago,  I found that very few traditions were
 
actually moribund -
-
 there weren't too many "endangered arts"  to
 
use the Japanese phrase -
-
 but there weren't too many at that
 
time that were lively and growing either.
 The intensive
 
centralization of the national media and the national
 
educational system have been drowning out the smaller or local
 
voices and reducing them to a murmur.
 So local accents,  local
 
repertoires,  particular customs,  all the special ways and
 
delights of  living that help you know that you're either at home
 
or someplace else nice don't often get into the schools or onto
 
the tube.
 Instead we have bland no-visible-culture stick-figure
 
families  like Dick and Jane in our school books and stereotyped
 
big-city violence on our television so incessantly you're afraid
 
to walk out your door in the morning.
 And neither are true.
 
A.
 
-
 16 -  
I sometimes tell people that folk art is the art that helps
 
you know where you are when you get off the airplane.
 The
 
airports have pretty much the same architecture,  they look
 
pretty much the same whether you're in St.  Louis or Mobile;  the
 
books in the bookstand will be pretty much the same in Seattle
 
and Miami,  the music over the Muzak will be pretty much the
 
same.
 If you get a chance to go to a concert,  you'll probably
 
hear much the same program even there -
-
 whether you hit a
 
symphony orchestra program or a Michael Jackson big bash,  it'll
 
be the same in Boston or Minneapolis.
 And sadly enough,  that's
 
happening around the world.
 I could say the same thing about
 
Paris or Tokyo.
 If this continues,  as my brother once wrote in
 
an unforgettable sentence,  "If this condition of cultural
 
grey-out continues,  pretty soon there will be no place in the
 
world worth visiting,  and no particular reason to stay home
 
either."
 
So when our young people look around them,  what they too
 
often see is that society as a whole,  the big part of i
t
 
doesn't value what their grandparents or their ethnic hc
 
thought was good stuff.
 And young people,  after all,  have to
 
-
 17 -
 
look to the future -
-
 or they think they do.
 Part of us old
 
timer's job then is to remind them that the past has some
 
important things to offer too.
 And just as in the fine arts
 
world where we must remind students that Beethoven and
 
Michelangelo still have something important to say to the human
 
spirit,  so in the folk arts world we must remind people that a
 
French ballad from the Old Mines section of Missouri and a Black
 
string band tune from Kansas City have something to contribute
 
to our spiritual welfare as well,  and we should treasure the
 
people who can make that contribution.
 And I' m happy to be able
 
to report to you that across the nation in many localities,
 
these days,  regional traditions are rising back up and holding
 
their own.
 People are looking with fresh respect and
 
appreciation to their local traditional practices.
 
Which leads me to point out that the state of Missouri has
 
been one of the fore-runners of this new revival.
 Missouri has
 
been doing a commendable job of defending and promoting its
 
traditional arts and its traditional artists for quite some
 
time.
 I grieve over the fact that the Frontier Folklife
 
Festival no longer brightens the land around the Arch every
 
 
I
 
4
 
-
 18 -  
summer,  and I suppose that you grieve over the fact that your
 
talented and devoted folk arts coordinator Barry Bergey has
 
moved to Washington to work with us in the wider scene and Amy
 
Skillman has gone to Pennsylvania.
 But you continue to pursue
 
the work that needs to be done through the ingenious cooperative
 
relationship you have worked out between the Missouri Arts
 
Council and the University of Missouri under the able leadership
 
of Ray Brassieur and Howard Marshall.
 The Missouri Old Time
 
Fiddlers Association with Charlie Walden and Gordon McCann among
 
others,  sets an example of constructive and cooperative effort
 
that has excited nation-wide interest.
 Your state Traditional
 
Apprenticeship Program has shown the way to many other states
 
4
 
that now model their programs on yours..
 ina
4 tly,  it is not
 
insignificant that three Missouri state folk artists -
-
 bluesman
 
Henry Townsend,  gospel singer Willie Mae Ford Smith and most
 
recently quilter Mabel Murphy who I believe is here with us
 
today -
-
 have received National Heritage Fellowship awards.
 It
 
is fascinating to observe that we find this kind of record only
 
in states that have,  over a significant period of time,
 
cherished and made some kind of public fuss over and given some
 
kind of steady encouragement to its resident folk artists.
 
I
  
-
 19 -
 
So maybe I haven't been preaching to the choir this
 
afternoon -
-
 I hope not.
 I think you've been doing a great job,
 
but I also think that every once in a while it's useful to back
 
away a bit and take a longer look at what we've been up to.
 I
 
know that working all these notions into a hopefully coherent
 
series of remarks has refreshed my own appreciation of the work
 
that lies behind us as well as ahead,  and I hope it has done the
 
same for you.
 I should like to thank the Missouri Arts Council
 
for its hospitality and hope that when any of you come to
 
Washington to see our capital,  now coming in to its spring
 
beauty,  you will drop in and pay us a visit in Folk Arts.
 Thank
 
you.

TALK TO MISSOURI ARTS COUNCIL MEETING
 
I
f
 
I war4t to take some time with this distinguished com any 
/
 
today to/think together about folk arts in an overal]/sen e.
 It
 
is an oddly difficult topic because folk arts are often so
 
imperce tib1e,  so insignificant sometimes,  so ordinary
 
sometim s, so universal sometimes,  so daily. 
The folk arts part
 
of your life sometimes seems to be the daily part, but then it
 
turns oit to be quite different from the daily part of somebody
 
else's fife,  and how can that be?
 
'Let's get right down to how folk arts happen.
 I
've thought
 
a lot about them and how they have Influenced my own life.
 When
 
I was a little girl, my family lived in east Texas out in the
 
country,  and so my mother decided to teach me at home.
 She
 
taught me Latin and piano and medieval history and lots of
 
unusual things, but she also taught me the day-to-day things.
 
She taught me how to sew, for example.
 I remember sitting with
 
her rag bag that contained scraps of material from all the
 
clothes mother had made for us and sort of folding doll clothes
 
out of them.
 
- 2
 
But then I had to learn how to do it right.
 My mother was a
 
great believer in that.
 She gave me a Latin motto (she gave all
 
us children different mottos).
 Mine was "Faciendo ediscere
 
facere" which means "By doing you learn to do" and she would
 
tell me over and over,  "by reading you learn to read," "by
 
running you learn to run,"  "by sewing you learn to sew."
 So I
 
learned how to work her old foot treadle Singer sewing machine.
 
She gave me the front page of the Dallas Morning News and -
-
with the machine unthreaded -
-
 I had to sew up and down the
 
newsprint columns and around the photographs until I learned
 
just how to sew a straight line and turn a neat corner.
 And
 
then I had to learn how to embroider -
-
 because that's what all
 
little girls did in my part of the country -
-
 at least,  little
 
Anglo girls like me.
 All of my friends,  like me,  knew how to do
 
the French knot and the outline stitch and the lazy daisy and
 
the feather stitch.
 
And then every November, my mother and I would go to the
 
dime store and I would get to pick out the presents I was going
 
to make for Christmas.
 In those days you could buy dresser
 
scarves or table napkins or bridge table covers or pillow cases
 
that had designs stencilled on them with blue dots.
 And
 
"embroidering" was to cover those blue dots with French knots
 
-3
 
and lazy daisies in different colors so it would turn out to be
 
a special present that you yourself had made.
 
I
 
So  after  I had picked out  the  item I wanted  to  embroidei  f
 
my sister or my mother or my great aunt,  I would go to the
 
embroidery thread counter and pick out the colors.
 There
 
always white embroidery thread,  I remember,
 
-
-
 pale green, pink,  lavender, yellow, blue
 
and sometimes red.
 I agonized.
 One year I
 
and lots of pastels
 
and sometimes black
 
remember coming home
 
with red and black and green and pink and lavender and white,
 
and my sister said,  "Honey, you don't want to use that red and
 
black; they won't blend.
 You want it to blend and be pretty."
 
And I thought it might be pretty, but I tried it and it wasn't.
 
It didn't blend -
-
 and I had to pick it all out and start again.
 
Now when I remember what was in the ragbag -
-
 scraps from my
 
dresses and the shirts and blouses
 
and her own dresses and aprons and
 
business shirts -
-
 those pieces of
 
mother made for the others,
 
good pieces from father's old
 
cloth weren't scarlet or
 
magenta or orange.
 They were lavender and aquamarine and pale
 
blue,  and they were solid colors or small prints.
 I guess you
 
could say we were conservative.
 And every once in a while my
 
mother would load up the ragbag into the car and we would go to
 
I
 
4
 
I
 
see the quilt lady who lived about two miles from us.
 This was
 
during the depression and everybody did what they knew how to do
 
to make a few cents,  and this lady really knew how to make
 
quilts.
 Mother and she would look over all the scraps,  and sh
 
would get out all her patterns from the newspapers,  and they
 
would decide which pattern would look best with the material we
 
had.
 The idea was, you see, not to have to buy material; nobody
 
could afford that in those days.
 But this lady could take all
 
our old bits and pieces and make absolutely beautiful quilts out
 
of them.
 Mother always said she was a real artist at her work.
 
So all the quilts on our beds turned out to be blendy. 
They
 
were made out of the clothes we wore and the colors we had
 
chosen and the aesthetic principles we had learned -
-
 neat
 
corners,  straight lines, balanced curves, precise workmanship,
 
unemphasized dividing lines,  subtle color gra &ttions.
 It's
 
actually a wonderful system -
-
 around the world it has produced
 
some beautiful effects from 19th century Italian paintings to
 
British flower gardens to Chinese porcelain to east Texas quilts.
 
But,  although the quilt lady,  as everybody I knew called
 
her, was an artist 
it gradually became clear that I wasn't .
.
 c-J-
Sewing just didn't really interest me.
 I learned those things
 
that an east Texas little girl needed to know but that was it.
 
- 5
 
I
 
I didn't become an artist.
 On the other hand those aesthetic
 
principles I learned as a a child have never left me.
 At home
 
at this moment there is a basket by my chair full of woven
 
squares I
'm putting together for a baby blanket -
-
 and I giggle
 
a bit sometimes when I look at them,  for with the world of color
 
and gaiety to choose from I picked out white and pale green and
 
the sweetest pale yellow to make those squares out of, because I
 
thought they would just work up so pretty... 
Now this is a very homely story,  and I hope that many of you
 
-
(- 4 t
 
recognize it and can understand its power.
 But we have not
 
explored it all the way yet.
 Notice,  for example,  that although
 
my mother considered it essential for me to learn the principles
 
of sewing,  she did not consider it necessary to show me the
 
rudiments of basketry or of pottery.
 What you do not learn or
 
experience marks you as distinctively as what you do.
 I
'm sorry
 
to say that as a child I didn't know any Mexican or Black or
 
Indian children who were neighbors to me in east Texas, but I
 
can tell you that it is likely they would have had instruction
 
in different aesthetic activities than I.
 A recent research
 
project in the county of Mount Pleasant,  South Carolina where
 
ancient African basketry tradition connected with rice growing
 
is still alive and thriving indicates that every single African
 
6
 
I
 
American man, woman and child past the lap baby stage in that
 
community can make a basket.  I can't.
 I don't really have any
 
idea how to start.
 Basket making was not part of the tradition
 
in which I was brought up.
 How sad -
-
' I
 
And consider the various color palettes that are in use
 
A
 
around the world.
 American Indians often emphasize clear
 
primary colors each of which represents a different, direction -
-
east, north,  south, west, up, down; they point a way rather than

coordinator for the state of
 
Arizona told me a few years ago that he had noticed many of the

had developed.
 No, he was told, the only Arizona paper company
 
that carried tissue paper had decided that they would just sell
 
to the big department stores in future so they haO cut hark the
 
colors to those that "most people"  (anglos)  like.  ) hen I last

It is astonishing how deep these early experiences lie and
 
how potent they are.
 Some years ago I was attending a concert
 
that presented a sampling of the musicians scheduled to appear
 
at a large multi-ethnic festival in Los Angeles.
 There were
 
scores of musical performances from all around the world; kilted
 
Scots bagpipers marched down the central aisle, African drummers
 
thundered from the stage, mariachi orchestras blazed and
 
trumpeted, gospel choirs filled the enormous hall with
 
sonorities.
 I was in my element, making knowledgeable remarks
 
to my companions, thrilling to each extrao rdinary set of
 
sounds.
 The whole thing dragged on for hours, each performance
 
more special than the last until almost at the end three
 
slightly bedraggled looking men carrying a banjo,  a guitar and a
 
string bass shambled out on the stage,  fussed around rather
 
unprofessionally for a minute or two and then struck up "Red
 
Wing."  And my heart absolutely melted.
 The most extraordinary
 
sense of total well-being came over me,  I was comforted,  I was
 
secure,  I was home, that was m
y song.
 And I realized, to my
 
great embarrassment, that if I had seen a copy of the program
 
ahead of time, Red Wing would have come down towards the last of
 
my list of favorites.
 I had moved so far away from my roots I
 
had forgotten where they lay.
 But my roots hadn't forgotten;
 
there they were ready to remind me who I am and where I come
 
from...
 
- 9
 
So  that,  ultimately,  is what multi-culturalism is  about,
 
making sure that everybody on the one hand gets to check back to
 
his own roots every once in a while and on the other hand gets a
 
chance to revel in the glories of the inventiveness that other
 
cultures have to share with us.
 It's a nice system; we just
 
have to keep on trying to ensure that everybody gets their turn..
 
and that the quality stays high.
 
For remember my quilt lady as compared to me as  a child  and
 
an adult.
 She was an artist,  I wasn't.
 And everybody around
 
knew that.
 If you had asked anybody in our county who was a
 
good quilt maker, every one would have mentioned this lady's
 
name; they could also have told you -
-
 depending on who you
 
asked -
-  who was a good blues picker, or who knew the whole of
 
"las posadas."
 The
 jr
 is.
.JLb
. t Everybody in a folk group
 
knows the traditional art forms and has experienced their basic
 
4.
 )
 -
'-
 I -L
 
aesthetic principles,\ but this does '
not mean that every member
 
of that group is an artist.
 Artists are special members of any
 
community and must be cherished as such.
 
It's the same in any art form from anywhere.
 I once wrote
 
that it probably takes 10,000 little girls learning to play "Fur
 
&tj(
 '
 
Elise" on the piano to produce one Dame Myra Hess (or any other
 
piano virtuoso).
 Every individual artist regardless of art form
 
-
 10 -
 
or origin emerges out of and depends upon a massive support
 
system of elders who convey the "rudimentsAh' of teachers who
 
recognize and polish budding talent, of other artists who
 
compare and compete, of promoters who present and exhibit, of
 
audiences who applaud and buy, of critics who scold Â§nd praise.
 
Which is more important to a mountain -
-
 the top or the bottom,
 
the peak or the bedrock?
 
Actually, the longer I work with folk arts,  the more it
 
seems to me the problems in folk arts are exactly the same as
 
the problems in all art forms whether you call them classical or
 
fine or whatever.
 All artists have pretty much the same needs.
 
They need to be heard or seen or experienced,  they need their
 
work to get out ipto the world.
 They need audiences, whether
 
d they need educated and sophisticated
 
audiences
 "
N audiences that understand the rudiments of the
 
particular art form and won't be expecting excitement where
 
serenity is the order of the art or blendy colors where visual
 
contrast is the desideratum.
 (I keep remembering the Anglo
 
county social workers in the deep south who used to give Black
 
quilters color wheels in an attempt to teach them how to make
 
their quilts blendy instead of vibrant.
 They didn't realize you
 
could as well look across the color wheel for contrast as side
 
by side for harmony.)
 
large or small,
 
1
1
 
L
 
There are some other simple needs that all artists share -
-
A
 
they need to have their work included in public school curricula
 
so that all children can be exposed to their special aesthetic
 
principles,  they need to have their property and personal rights
 
protected from exploitation, they need to be able to make a
 
little money at their art form from time to time.
 Finally they
 
need to be criticized; they need to have their work held to high
 
standards,  so long as, of course, the standards are the
 
standards of that aesthetic system.
 For that you need a corps
 
of aficionados, people who have steeped themselves in the
 
particular aesthetic system, who love it and defend it.
 That is
 
why the Folk Arts Program insists that folk arts projects need
 
"
s
 
.
-
-
 community and outside experts on the particular art form;
 
our folk arts coordinators,  like your fine Ray Brassieur,  spend
 
much of their time making sure that qualified expertise is
 
involved in every major folk arts project.
 Just stop and think
 
a moment -
-
 you wouldn't put on an important exhibit of 20th
 
century painting or a brand new Shakespeare festival without
 
having it put together by a trained art curator on the one hand
 
and a drama expert on the other.
 It's just the same with folk
 
arts.

When I started worrying over folk arts across the nation

some years ago,  I found that very few traditions were actually
 
moribund -

 there weren 't too many "endangered arts" to use the

you know that you're either at home or someplace else nice don't
 
often get into the schools or onto the tube.

promoting its traditional arts and its traditional artist 
sA  L
 
grieve over the fact that the Frontier Folklife Festival no

suppose that you grieve over the fact that your talented and
 
devoted folk arts coordinator Barry Bergey has moved to
 
Washington to work with us in the wider scene and Amy Skillman
 
has gone to Pennsylvania.
 But you continue to pursue the work
 
that needs to be done through the ingenious cooperative
 
relationship you have worked out between the Missouri Arts
 
Council and the University of Missouri under the able leadership
 
of Ray Brassieur and Howard Marshall.

 Finally,  it is not insignificant
 
that three Missouri state folk artists -

 have

 It is fascinating
 
to observe that we find this kind of record only in states that

kind of public fuss over and given some kind of steady

So
 I haven't been preaching to the choir this
 
afternoon.
 I think you've been doing a great job, but I also
 
think that every once in a while it's useful to back away a bit
 
and take a longer look at what we've been up to.
 I know that
 
working all these notions into a hopefully coherent series of
 
remarks has refreshed my own appreciation of the work that lies
 
behind us as well as ahead,  and I hope it has done the same for
 
you.
 I should like to thank the Missouri Arts Council for its
 
hospitality and hope that when any of you come to Washington to
 
41 
see our capital, now a  tho--1 &i it--.i  its spring beauty, you
 
will drop in and pay us a visit in Folk Arts.
 Thank you.
