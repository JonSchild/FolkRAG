DANCING IN THE SUNLIGHT, 
Written and composed by JAMES MAAS for the GIRARD BROTH-
ERS, and sung by them with immense success, at the 
Howard Athelmum, Boston. 
What a 
pleasure there is in dancing the sunlight, 
When all earth seems to smile; 
It makes a 
merry ringing in your laughter, 
You have no care or guile. 
With ringing notes from pearly throats, 
We while the hours away; 
With beaming smile our time beguile, 
We are always blythe and gay. 
Oh, what a 
pleasure there is dancing in the sunlight, 
When all earth seems to smile; 
It makes a 
merry ringing in your laughter, 
You have no care or guile. 
CHORUS. 
Hark, hark 
hear the music ring, (stint ) 
Shout, shout 1 
raise your voice and sing. (
sum.) 
What a 
pleasure there is dancing in the sunlight, 
When all earth seems to smile; 
It maws a 
merry ringing in your laughter, 
You have no care or guile. 
What a 
pleasure there is dancing in the sunlight, 
For it will make you glad; 
In the golden rays its shadow it will mock you, 
And whirl and dance like mad. 
When sunset's come, and day is done, 
And darkness claims her right, 
We'll go to rest, and the blest, 
The rays of morning light. 
Oh I 
What a 
pleasure there is dancing in the sunlight, 
When all earth seems to smile; 
It makes a 
merry ringing in your laughter, 
You have no care or guile. 
Hark, hark, etc. 
WHAT SHALL I 
DO, 
Written and sung by J. D. 
ROOME. 
Oh ! dear, I'm almost crazy, 
With all my care and strife, 
For a 
big galoot has run away 
With my darling little wife. 
His hair it was a 
carotty red, 
lie was dressed in a 
suit of blue; 
When I 
catch him, I'd like to know 
What shall I 
do! 
Oh, what shall I 
do. 
My mother-in-law stays in the house; 
We do nothing now but fight; 
She told my wife to run away, 
And she said that it served inc right. 
I 
want to find my darling wife, 
So I 
now appeal to you; 
When I 
get her, I'd like to know 
What shall I 
do ! 
Oh, what shall I 
do! 
The night that she did run away, 
A carriage came to the door; 
I 
asked her where she was going to, 
And she told me to hold my jaw. 
I 
caught her wildly by the arm, 
Says I. 
My dearest Sue, 
When you're away, I'd like to know. 
What shall I ! Oh, what shall I 
do! 
There's a 
warrant out for my arrest, 
For she has sued for divorce; 
I'll have to give up my darling wife, 
Or else I'll then be forced. 
g) away to some distant land, 
So now I'll bid you all adieu ; 
But I 
have no money, and I'd like to know, 
What shall I 
do? 
Oh, what shall I 
do? 
THE. NIGGERS GAVE A 
BALL. 
Sung by GIRARD BROTHERS with great applause. 
The niggers gave a 
ball last week; 
To see the sight would make you squeak. 
The boys they came for miles around, 
To flop their flat foot on the ground. 
They had a 
jawbone and a 
fiddle, 
Banjo as big as a 
pancake griddle, 
Trombone and a 
double bass, 
With string that stuck like jugerpast. 
CHORUS. 
Slam your foot up to the sky, 
Don't you hear the wenches sigh, 
Huckleberry do, and cranberry jam, 
Sallie pass along some ham. 
There was Margaret and Motildo, 
Anomostator and Molinder, 
Sarrafelier came to the hop, 
The wench that busted the policy shop. 
They danced and danced in two and twos.. 
And wore the soles all off their shoes. 
When a 
nigger hit a 
gong a 
smash, 
All the coons ran up for hash. 
Slam your foot, etc. 
The supper was a 
sight to see, 
With catfish, coons, and fricassc; 
With eels and liver served on toast, 
And aligators boiled and roast. 
They eat until they couldn't walk. 
Drank gin until they couldn't talk; 
Danced till they fell down in the hall, 
And that busted up the fancy hall. 
Slam your foot, etc.

EYES OF SPARKLING BRIGHTNESS. 
ORIGINAL SONG AND DANCE. 
Written and sung by the GIRARD BROTHERS. 
Those eyes of sparkling brightness, 
How they haunt us in our dreams, 
They're as bright as flowing ripples, 
Beneath the sun's bright beams ; 
Like dew- drops on the meadow, 
At morning's dawning hour, 
We feel within our heart and soul, 
Love's own sweet magic power. 
Over vale and mountain, (
sym.) 
Violets and fountains, (
sym.) 
Then we'll sing the praise of summer days, 
Of eyes that sparkle bright, 
Through weal or woe, where'er we go, 
They fill us with delight. 
When the nightingale is singing 
Her songs upon the lea, 
We hear sweet voices ringing, 
Of nature gay and free ; 
When the sun shines on the river, 
And the shadow's on the hill, 
We'll dream of thee though far away, 
Those eyes will haunt us still. 
Over vale, etc. 
STRIKE THE HASH HAMMER. 
Air—" Strike the Harp Gently," 
Sung by J. D. ROOME. 
Strike the gong loudly, oh, landlord, do, please, 
And tell us when dinner is on, 
I.ve fasted since breakfast on crackers and cheese, 
My appetite craves to be gone; 
I've lived on free lunch for the last week or two, 
One square meal I'd like to endure, 
Then strike the hash hammer, oh, landlord, now do, 
And I'll punish your victuals for sure. 
Then seize the bass drum stick and hit her once hard, 
Oh, go for it, pretty landlord, 
Yes, there hangs the dinner gong, gracefully seize 
And slug it just once for me please. 
Strike the gong loudly, oh, landlord, now do, 
Your soup, beef and mutton I'll fix, 
A 
healthy man can't live on wind pudding stew, 
Cold water, long walks and toothpicks; 
The last time I 
stopped here I 
paid you my board, 
And I 
ate till I 
thought I 
would bust, 
Of your meats, pies and all your hotel could afford, 
And you bounced me out when I 
said trust. 
Then strike the Dutch oven, oh, landlord, just once, 
Let the savory flavor now come, 
I 
hear now the distant sweet sound. of the gong, 
Of beef- steak and onions, yam ! yam!

SWEETEST AND FAIREST. 
(Original Song and Dance.) 
Written and sung by the GIRARD BROTHERS. 
The sweetest and the fairest is the girl I 
met one day, 
While riding in a 
stage- coach coming down Broadway; 
Smiling as she entered, oh, indeed she looked so sweet, 
I 
arose at once and asked her if she would have a 
seat. 
CHORUS. 
Then I'd like to win her heart and hand, (sym.) 
She's the fairest in the land, (
sym.) 
Then the village bells will sweetly chime, 
As we march side by side, 
And some happy day I'll claim her 
As my own loving bride. 
At length I 
did approach her, and to me she looked so 
sweet, 
And said, " I 
hope some future day we again shall 
meet." 
We had a 
pleasant chat there, and she arose to leave, 
She said, " I 
hope to meet you, some afternoon or eve." 
Then I'd

DOWN BY THE SUN-RISE. 
(END SONG.) 
Composed and sung by EDWARD GIRARD. 
Brothers and sisters, oh, how do you do, 
Down by the sunrise, playing on a 
golden harp. 
I'm pretty well and how are you, 
Down by the sunrise, playing on a 
golden harp. 
The rich man live and the poor man must die, 
Down by the sunrise, playing on a 
golden karp. 
CHORUS. 
Glor-i-a 
I'm travelling down by the sunrise, 
Playing on a 
golden harp. 
(Repeat.) 
As I 
was corning down the road, 
Down by the sunrise, playing on a 
golden harp; 
I 
met old Gabriel with a 
heavy load, 
Down by the sunrise, playing on a 
golden harp; 
I 
said, " Old Gabriel, how do you do?" 
Down by the sunrise, playing on a 
golden harp. 
"Go ' way, nigger man, I 
don't know you!" 
Down by the sunrise, playing on a 
golden harp.

KNIVES TO GRIND, 
Now, white folks, I 
beg you don't wonder at me; 
Though colored, I 
am not at all proud; 
I've got a 
short story to tell in my song, 
And I'll try hard to sing it out loud. 
I've got a 
bull pup named Terrible Pete. 
He is cross-eyed, bow-legged, and has but three feet, 
I 
never saw another that he could'nt beat, 
Oh, be was a 
terrible purp. 
While walking down town one Sunday night, I 
With this magnificent bull Newfoundland cub, 
Another kiodel kicked him in the eye, 
And he was insulted at this. 
He went for this dog and chewed off his ear, 
'Tis the truth I 
tell you, though it may seem queer, 
And then with myself he got chock full of beer, 
Did this beautiful black and tan hound.

J. 
NEW SUBJECT. 
BANJO SOLO. 
Written and composed by J. D. ROOME. 
I 
am going to sing you a 
beautiful song, 
And the subject I 
know is quite new, 
Such subjects are scarce, as you're well aware, 
. And good, things less frequent than few; 
So with your kind permit I'll proceed with my dit, 
Very close you must watch for the plot 
Of the beautiful thing which I'm going to sing, 
For the right idea surely I've got. 
Most every new song has the same old ding-dong 
Style of subject ' bout mottoes and dames, 
But this exhibition of my composition, 
Has new and original claims; 
There's one thing I'll mention—your quiet attention 
Is needed to help me along, 
For I 
want you to hear something good that's not queer, 
So prepare for my beautiful song. 
And now as you're quiet, I 
think I 
will try it, 
But before I 
proceed I 
must say 
Of each beautiful verse that I'm going to rehearse— 
Don't steal it or give it away; 
Yet I 
don't feel afraid to make a 
parade 
Of my modest but eloquent ditty, 
I'm among my friends here, and I 
hope to make clear 
Something sensible, solid and and witty. 
Now 
just one Anal word before I 
am heard 
In the rhymes of my recommendation— 
You are quite well aware that we all should prepare, 
To produce well requires preparation; 
So now if you please, with the greatest ot ease 
Ill proceed, for I 
know it's all right, 
Just pull down your ears and tie back your vest, 
And I'll sing it to-morrow night.

RACE OF LIFE 
Sung by THE FIELDINGS. 
WHAT curious things are taking place, 
In life's uncertain bustling race, 
And each great comer brings to view 
New points of speed, and action to 
Now as I 
mention some of these, 
I 
hope my patrons I 
shall please, 
I'll try and not exaggerate, 
The truth in anything I 
state. 
CHORUS. 
I've found it out, I 
do declare, 
That the race of life is a 
funny affaii, 
And all the way through, from whert,. a 
begins, 
t 
isn't the fastest:nag that wins. 
There's Deacon Sly, the batchelor, 
Who's much respected near and far, 
He's slow and easy in his way, 
And the people thinK he's quite au fait, 
But the Deacon inclines to play the roue, 
And he plays it successfully too, 
A rounded form, and a 
roguish eye, 
Brings out the speed of De icon Sly. 
I've found it out, &c 
7 
There's the dry goods clerk, Adolphus Moore, 
With salary small, at Jone's store, 
lie seems a 
pattern, I 
must confess. 
Of industry and soberness; 
But I 
happen to know that every night, 
Adolphus goes the tiger to fight, 
He loses his stamps in a 
careless way, 
But how he affords it, I 
shan't say. 
I've found it out, &c. 
There's Col. Smart, the revenue man, 
Who makes collections for Uncle Sam; 
He gets just fifteen hundred a 
year, 
With his office and such expenses clear, 
But the Colonel stops at the crack hotel, 
Spends lots of money and cuts a 
swell, 
And he's building a 
residence costly and dear. 
But how, on fifteen hundred a 
year. 
I've found it out, ktc. 
I 
could a 
hundred others name, 
Whose points of speed are much the same, 
But you'd get weary so would I, 
And thus for the present I'll pass them by, 
But I 
think with me you'll all declare, 
The race of life's a 
funny affair, 
And all the way through from where it begins, 
It isn't the fastest nag that wins. 
I've found it out, & c. 
A 
genuine Plantation Song and Melody. 
Sung characteristically, By T. M. HENGLER. 
I 
rise lip early in the morn, 
I 
hear old Gabriel blow his horn; 
Make haste, darkies, don't you wait, 
'Caze you all may lose them keys to do gate. 
CHORUS. 
Angels, meet me on the cross-road, meet roe, 
Angels, meet me on the cross-road, meet me, 
Angels, meet me on the cross-road, meet me, 
I 
ain't given to charge any tole. 
(Repeat Chorus.) 
What kind of shoes does the angels ware? 
Dat ( ley- can walk around up in Heaven in de air, 
I 
stand by de gate, I 
hear de angels knock, 
And I 
put all de nickels in de missionary box. 
Angels, meet me, etc. 
Written by HARRY BENNETT, 
Expressly for BRYANT & W ILLIAMS. 
When twilight falls so soft and sweet, 
And silent is the hour, 
My charming girl I 
long to meet, 
Within some leafy bower, 
And whisper sweet tales in her ear, 
And promises so true. 
To me she is the one most dear, 
My little bright-eyed Lou. 
(Break.) Her dancing smiles they seem to cheer my heart. (Slim.) 
(Break.) I'm sorely wounded with little cupid's dart. 
(Sym,.) 
Her smiles will ever cheer my %yak, 
She's loving, kind and true. 
I'm waiting for that happy day, 
I'll wed my bright-eyed Lou. 
Her voice is full of melody, 
Her lips are rosy red. 
She wears a 
jaunty little hat 
Upon her darling head; 
A cunning little foot, Oh, my! 
The size is number two, 
'Tis all these charms that make me love 
My little bright eyed Lou. (Break.)

SHE SMILED ON ME SO SWEET. 
Sung by YALE. 
There is a 
dart that pierced my heart, 
'Twas thrown by a 
darling girl, 
Whose eyes are bright as diamonds, 
And her hair hangs down in curls. 
I 
can't forget the evening, 
When first we chanced to meet; 
We were riding in an omnibus, 
She smiled on me so swaet. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, I'd be as happy as a 
bumble-bee, 
That flies around the street; 
If I 
could only find the girl 
That smiled on me so sweet. 
I 
tried in vain to meet her, 
Ever since that happy night 
That I 
met my little fair one, 
For I 
loved her at first sight. 
But still I'm not discouraged, 
For I 
live in hopes to meet 
This darling little creature, 
That smiled on me so sweet. 
Oh, I'd be as . 
happy, etc,

THE O'GR ADYS. 
ORIGINAL SONG. 
Words by HARRY BF.NNETT. 
Sung by the PEASLEYS, JOHN 
and LEA. 
Good evening to you, gents and ladies, 
We've come here to make a 
call, 
Descendants of the great O'Gradys, 
The best you'll find in Donegal. 
A 
year ago we took the notion 
To sail across the briny deep. 
The sea was in a 
great commotion, 
We could not get a 
wink of sleep. 
CILORUS. 
They call us now the great O'Gradys, 
We'll fight till we're pushed to the wall, 
The young folks they were all a 
crying, 
The day we left ould Donegal. 
We were known throughout the country; 
The devil the one with us could dance, 
We were the first in every motion, and drink 
Whenever we had the chance. 
We used to drive the girls all crazy, 
So nimbly we could shake our feet; 
They never found us slow or lazy, 
At dancing we could not be beat. 
They call us, etc.

I 
want a 
beau, now please don't laugh, 
I 
mean just what I 
say 
I 
am determin'd I 
shall now 
No longer single stay. 
But where there are so many, 
It is difficult to choose, 
Some may have other fish to fry, 
And therefore me refuse. 
,Spoken—" This is the sort of man I 
want." 
CHORUS. 
He must be neat, he must be sweet, 
His brains in his head must be; 
He must not stare at girls, 
Whene'er he walks abroad with me! 
He must not drink, he must not think 
When I 
speak, to make reply; 
Work ev'ry day, give me his pay; 
None other need apply! 
I 
fancy that with such a 
one, 
Life would a 
pleasure be; 
But where to find just such a 
man, 
Is what perplexes me; 
Perhaps he may be in the throng 
Collected here to night; 
If so, I 
hope he'll step right up, 
I'll make the rest all right.

Where the golden sunbeams play; 
Gazing out upon the beauty 
Of a

Sat a 
lovely little maiden, 
To me she looked divine; 
Oh, how I 
long for the dly to come 
When I

To me she looked devine, 
This darling, charming little pearl, 
I 
soon shall call her mine

This lovely little maiden 
I'm going now to see, 
She lives in yonder cottage; 
I

When her ill make my bride, 
Then together we will wander 
Down lite's dreamy tide.

THE COLORED UPPER TEN. 
ORIGINAL CHARACTER SONG AND DANCE. 
Written for and sung by PEASLEY & HUGHES. 
Words by 
G. S. KNIGHT. Music by FRANK CARDELLA. 
Watch our style and dashing figure, 
We always travel with gentlemen, 
For we're known as two of the colored upper ten, 
Known as two of the colored upper ten; 
We always did detest that vulgar name of nigger, 
We've been called by that name, and though it did of-
fend, 
We never did take notice or the insult e'er resent, 
For we're known as two of the colored upper ten, 
Known as two of the colored upper ten. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, my gracious! can't we sling our yams (
break) 
Glory hallelujah to all the blessed lambs, 
(
break) 
Watch our feet and watch them close, they've educated 
been, 
For we're known as two of the colored upper ten, 
Known as two of the colored upper ten. 
We always dress up to the fashion, 
At each resort we both have been, 
For we're known as two of the colored upper ten, 
Known as two of the colored upper ten ; 
We're up to every game, and that you bet your cash on, 
At every race of note you'll find we do attend. 
We never borrow money nor neither do we lend, 
For we're known as two of the colored upper ten, 
Known as two of the colored upper ten. 
Oh, my gracious, etc.

IN an Ivy-covered cottage, 
Hidden back of oaken trees, 
Lives a 
lovely little maiden, 
Blythe and happy as you plasm 
Where upon a

Every summer's eventide, 
I 
sit amid the flowers fair

All among the roses, 
Making sweet proposes— 
Lovely, laughing, soul bewitching, 
Sweet Camillia May; 
Captivating, aggravating, 
Never tired of play— 
Flitting like a 
little birdie, 
Happy, light and gay; 
Kill me or I'll die with love 
For sweet, Canaillia May. 
There's a 
prutty white caimans, 
ver Owing 
in her hal: 
Lovely violets and roses 
Mewling in her fart 
fokii 
Little stars and merry sunshine 
In her eyes so bright and gay, 
And a 
choir of angels singing 
In the voice of Milly May. 
Al! among, 
Now forget not to remember, 
When in love you chance to be, 
Try and keep in all your feelings 
Not act foolishly like me; 
For I 
live on, hoping, dreaniing, 
Of a 
coining joyous day, 
When Ill make of one Camillia 
Such a

'TWAS a 
lovely summer's day, 
And the birds were singing gay, 
While the flow'rs fill'd the air with odor sweet, 
Strolling leisurely along, 
humming some old plaintive song, 
A 
charming little maiden I 
chanced to meet, 
She had eyes of bonny blue, 
And her cheekE a 
roseate hue, • 
Like a 
fairy flitting thro' a 
garden bower, 
Oh ! she looked divinely fair, 
Picking posie'f, here and there, 
While indeed she was herself the fairest flower. 
Pretty eyes of bonny blue, 
All my heart I 
give to you, 
Oh! she looked so sweet and fair, 
With her neck and shoulders bare; 
Anci my happy heart her image still embowers, 
I 
am like the littic bee,

All enraptured I 
stood there, • 
And I 
know it wasn't fair, 
For the blush went from the rose into her cheek; 
Turning round she seemed to smile, 
But with modesty the while, 
And respect and duty bade me then to speak, 
Pray excuse me, Miss, said I, 
But as I 
was passing by— 
Oh ! I 
found this plain gold ring, and thought ' twas yours 
Then she smiling, answered, no, 
Still she never bid me go, 
So we stood and talked awhile among the flowers. 
Pretty eyes, 
Viewing first the setting sun, 
Then we scw the rising moon, 
Sitting side by side upon the portico, 
While upon her little hand— 
1 
had placed the golden band, 
And was waiting for her answer, yes,or no, 
Surely love was on the wing, 
Cupid there came wandering, 
And was seeking shelter from the dewy showers, 
When he saw each loving heart, 
Loathing evermore to part, 
Then he tied the knot of love among the flowers.

The apple of my eye.

PARAGON OF STYLE, 
SONG AND DANCE. 
Written for and sung by LEA PEASLEY. Words and 
music by FRANK CARDELLA. 
'Twas on one Sunday eve, 
I 
thought I 
would relieve 
My busy mind by strolling through the park; 
When I 
met as if by chance, 
And caught a 
roguish glance, 
Of a 
charmer who seemed bent upon a 
lark. 
She was resting 'neath a 
tree, 
When first she looked at me, 
And of course my bounden duty was to smile; 
And quick it was returned. 
Oh! how my cheeks they burned, 
For this fair one was the paragon of style. 
CHORUS, 
'Twas 'neath an oak tree grand, 
While list'ning to the band, 
Perhaps a 
pleasant hour to beguile; 
When we met as if by chance, 
And she threw a 
roguish glance, 
For this fair one was the paragon of style. 
Kind friends, you've heard my song, 
And with it each detail 
Of our friendship, which was very short and sweet; 
And now I 
guess I'll go, 
But before I 
do I'll show 
A 
step I 
think it's very hard to beat. 
But on our wedding day, 
Which is not far away, 
We hope you'll come and stay a 
little while; 
And then you all can see 
How happy we can be, 
Together as the paragon of style.

When parting at the dawn of day,

SUNNY LAND. 
ORIGINAL SONG AND DANCE. 
By COTTON & 131111)1in. 
When we were together, in that sunny laud, 
Where all's Eternal Spring, 
We'd wander through the cotton fields, 
And hear the Jay-bird sing. 
We'd hunt the Old Raccoon, 
By the glimmer of the Moon, 
Whene'er we had a 
chance. 
At evening, when the boys were on the green, 
We'd join them in the festive dance ! 
CHORUS. 
Gay and smiling ! 
Hours beguiling! 
Oh, give us back the home we used to have, 
Down in that sunny land! 
When we were a 
courting Poll and Bess, 
Down in that sunny land ; 
We'd take them rowing on the Lake, 
Or strolling on the strand; 
We'd take the old Banjo, 
And together we would go 
And stay until the break of day! 
We wish those happy, happy days 
Had never passed away.

You see in us two nimble Mokc.;. 
We're called the magnet ! 
They cannot put the brakes on us 
As soon as day begins! 
We are like two balls of quicksilver, 
You never find us slow ; 
We are never happy, day or night, 
Unless we're on the go ! 
CHORUS. 
High-Low-Jack, in the game! 
We are really not to blame ; 
You'll have to watch us very close— 
Now what we say is true— 
Or else your eyes will be deceived, 
And you won't see what we do. 
Our style is quite original, 
With us none can compare. 
We bounce like India, Rubber balls, 
And cut while in the air. 
At Gymnastics we take the lead, 
At dancing we're not slow ! 
And grace is here personified, 
o 
watch us as we go.

Upon our word we will ; 
Brass buttons on our garments, 
And goose grease on our hair, 
And when we put our feet down, 
Oh! don't we make them stare! 
CHORUS. 
When the militia boys parade, 
The militia boys parade, 
We march right by their windows, 
The girls they laugh and wink; 
When the militia boys parade, 
The militia boys parade, 
We march right by their windows, 
And then they grin and blink. 
We don't care to go lighting, 
We'd sooner drink or eat. 
In drilling we are lively, 
Our bass drums can't lie beat; 
Our fathers they are wealthy, 
We're soldiers just for fun, 
And when it conies to fighting, 
Were lively with a 
run.

I've come to meet my Lulu ! 
In the starlight bright and clear. 
Oh she is such a

The Bell of all the town; 
If other nigs should flirt with her, 
My heart she would break down. 
Out in the starlight, with charming little Lue! 
She is my heart's delight, ever fond and true; 
Her bright blue eyes, enchanting, pierce me through

The idol of this darkey's heart is charming little Lue! 
Oh ! don't I 
love to meet her, 
In the shady dell; 
When little stars are twinkling, 
Such tales of love we tell. 
Oh, she can whisper softly 
As the wind blows through the trees. 
Two loving hearts beat quick and fast, 
As her little band I 
squeeze !

LOVE'S SERENADE. 
Words and Music by CLATJDE DEHAVEN. 
(Copyright secured.) 
WHEN in my dreams I 
fondly think of brother, 
When in visions fondly dream of mother, 
When the night long watch is ended, 
And the busy day suspended, 
All my fancies, all my visions may come true, 
Still in fancy dreaming I 
only love but you. 
Whed the midnight stars are peeping, 
And the silvery dew secreting 
Fragrance for the coming day; 
When auroras charms are blended 
To the Southern shies extended, 
Memory paints the picture—no matter what you sly. 
Deftly clings the moonlight 
On the curtained starlight, 
Chequered clouds of fancies floating all around; 
Glinted zephyrs playing—stately actions swaying 
In this pure Elysian—this holy fancy ground. 
Fire-flies dancing in the humming. 
Angels on their lutes are strumming. 
Love's cohorts in armor coming, 
O'er the mountains dipped in dew. 
Victory on their banner ensigned, 
Glory on their armor entwined, 
Still in fancy dreaming, I 
only love but you. 
11VONDER 'WHAT'S HER 'Nail; 
1' ew song and Dance written by T. M. liENOLFX 
THERE is a 
darling gay and sweet. 
I 
meet her every day, 
She has a 
cunning winning smile, 
And such a 
charming way, 
Each time I 
chance to pass her by, 
, 
She always smiles the same. 
She dresses neat and so complete, 
I 
wonder what's her name. 
Cllonui. 
Oh she is so neat and so coMplettl, 
She always smiles the same, 
I'd give the world if I 
knew, 
I 
wonder what's her name. 
[Repeat.] 
Last eve her elbow mine did touch, 
While standing in a 
throng, 
Itut quickly I 
apologized, 
And said, I 
mean no wrong. 
No harm, she said, for accidents, 
Like that are very tame, 
And then she left with a 
pretty smile, 
I 
wonder what's her name. 
Oh she, (to. 
Perhaps to-night she's in the crowd, 
That has assembled here, 
Will all my 
friends please look around. 
And find this pretty dear, 
ilhere whoever points her out, 
I'll not the slightest blame, 
Oh tell me where this darling is. 
I 
wonder what's her name. 
Oh she, eze.

Song and Dance. 
Written and sung with tremendous 
success, at TONY. PASTOR'S New Theatre, New York, 
BY Si lawns, America's Premier One-legged 
Song and Dance Artist and Jig Dancer. 
In the Central Park, the other day, 
I 
met my charmer fair, 
Her pretty face and beaming smiles— 
And she had such lovely hair— 
While from beneath her jockey hat 
Those curly tresses fell ; 
And when I 
smiled she blushed, and look'd 
Like the roses in the dell. 
CHORUS. 
And it's Oh, My! she looked divine. 
Row I 
Wished that she was mine. 
(sym) 
(sym) 
She's the fairest little flower I've ever seen; 
In the Park she is the Belle! 
Vithene'er we meet, her blush is just 
Like the roses in the dell. 
We sat awhile beneath the tree, 
The time flew swiftly by; 
She said she felt so happy then, 
But could not tell me why ; 
I 
asked her; then, if she'd be mine r 
Into my arms she fell, 
And answered " Yes !" and crimson blushed, 
Like the roses in the dell. 
And it's Oh, My!

Oh! here we are, as you can see, 
To sing and dance for you; 
Just watch our gymnastic feats, 
And our easy style, so new. 
We're going back to our southern home; 
Where oft we've been before. 
We'll show you what we used to do 
On de old Kentucky shore. 
CHORUS. 
And when at night our work was dove, 
Oh! that's the time our work was done, 
To see de coon and ' possum run, 
As often we did do. 
Those happy days have passed and gone, 
Dey'll never come no more; 
When we were happy little darks, 
In those sunny days of yore. 
Our father and mother they've both gone 
To dat happy golden door. 
Dey left us when two little darks, 
On de old Kentucky shore.

JUST FROM TENNESSEE. 
Original by JOHNSON AND BRUNO. 
White folks we are just from Tennessee, 
We left our homes to have some recreation; 
Greatly delighted we will he, 
If we can only gain your approbation. 
We parted from the old folks with a 
sigh, 
And left them there a-crying on the station; 
But they'll miss us, 'deed they will, 
And the place will be so still, 
Because the boys have left the old plantation. 
When moon-light streamed across the cabin floor, 
'Twas then the old man sat the banjo ringing; 
The darkies used to gather round the door, 
And massa too would listen to our singing. 
But often now we sigh for our old home, 
For it is the happiest spot in all theination 
But we'll go there before we die, 
And now we are going to try 
To show the style down on the old plantation.

We'll sing, (symp.) and dance, ( symr.) 
An' will shout ' till de broke ob de morn 
Den we'll all go to work

My coal black love she's as Evely as a

She can sing, she can dance and shout, 
Au' you ought to see dat ole mule prance, 
When I

I

And remember what we say.

So we'll tap de banjo and sing de chorus,

success by TEASLEY & HUGHES. 
We are two senators, you see, 
And know just what we're doing, 
Pray tell me where that sound came from ?

But don't make a

Or else to pardon we refuse, 
And sacrifice position.

Swells of the fashion, you see,

Stylish colored senators are we.

Since our emancipation, (

Although we have our fun at times, 
We dont forget our station. (

And to each one's satisfaction, '

'Twould surely cause distraction. 
For yes, we are, etc.

Music Published by L. P. GOTILLAIID, 86 Tremont Street, Boston. 
Down in the meadow, by the brook, where first I 
met my 
love, 
I 
told her there that I'd be true " as the shining stars 
above." 
'• Oh! she's so fair. I 
do declare she's beautiful, divine," 
The dearest girl and charmer, is Beautiful Caroline !

She's like a 
little twinkling star, [Symph.) 
She's so near and yet so far, [Synaph.1 
The dearest girl and charmer fair, 
And all the world beside. 
Is Caroline. this girl of mine— 
She soon will be my bride. 
We sat beneath a 
willow tree, to watch the running stream, 
She whispered tales of love to me, it seem'd as in a 
dream ; 
Oh! the sweet birds sang there evening song, which echo'd 
through the vine--
Each hour seem'd a 
life long dream, with Beautiful Caro-
line ! 
Chorus as before. 
We sat there 'till the twilight fell, the moon shone bright 
and clear ; 
Come. dearest, let's be off for home, she whispered in my 
ear. 
I 
saw her home and at the gate, the clock then just struck 
nine— 
Of what she said, I 
think I'll wed, my Beautiful Caroline!

for 
Pincnv. 
In this the great city, queer sights I 
have scc;i, 
And from them a 
song I 
have managed to glean: 
And when you have heard it, no doubt you'll agree, 
That things in town are not as they should be: 
In the first place, we hear a 
report every day, 
They're going to give 113 a Papid Transit Railway; 
But unless they soon do it, between you and me, 
Things in this town, are not as they should be.

The great so,:al evil to- day. I've no 0. iubt, 
Is the poor homeless tramp, who goes wandering about. 
lie cannot find shelter or food, if lie tries; 
What cares the cold world, if he sicktns and dies; 
Perhaps in his youth, he'd a 
bright-happy home. 
But cruel misfortune has caused him to roam ; 
If he can't get employment, he must steal you see, 
Which shows things are not just as they should be.

Boss Tweed is a 
man most talked about now, 
His departure last winter caused a 
great row; 
Of course we all know it was not a 
square game, 
But show me the man who would not, do the same; 
When Sweeny, Genet and Dick Connelly took flight, 
Ile stood here alone and made a gout light; 
lie did wrong, but when poor men were greatly in need, 
The first to assist them was William M. Tweed.

George Barnwell, THE MERCHANT'S CLERK. — This is an 
extremely sensational sketch, but shows Truth stranger than Fiction. 
This deluded victim went from crime to crime with a 
fearful rapidity, 
urged by the baneful influences of women lost to honor. He realized 
every moment the evils of his course, but, like a 
bird fluttering over the 
basilisk eye of the serpent, be wen1 down, down, into the vortex of ruin 
and despair. This book teaches, in the strongest way, the moral lesson 
of resisting that temptation , which comes arrayed like an " angel of 
light"—beautiful to the eye, and blasting to the soul.... Price 25 Cents.
