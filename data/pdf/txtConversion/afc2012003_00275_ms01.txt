The “Big Top” Show Goes On  
An Oral History of Occupations Inside and Outside the Canvas Circus Tent 
 
About B.K. Silverlake… 
 
B.K. Silverlake was born in Ora, Indiana in August of 1946 to Emma and Raymond Duke. 
The Dukes were in the circus business at the time B.K. was born. Two weeks later she was 
traveling with the circus. Having worked in the circus business her whole life, she has 
literally done every job from booking to performing. 
 
In the fall of 1967, she married Melvin Silverlake. The Dukes and the Silverlakes knew and 
worked together long before B.K. was born. In 1967 the Silverlakes bought Clark and 
Walters Circus, where everyone worked together once again. In the winter of 1970, the 
family decided to open a second show, and Melvin and B.K. opened Fisher Brothers Circus 
to carry on the family name as Melvin’s grandfather took out the original Fisher Brothers in 
the 1930s. 
 
After Fisher Brothers, B.K. continued to remain very involved in the circus and carnival 
industry through the years. 
 
B.K. and Melvin have one son, Mel Ray. She currently resides in Hugo, Oklahoma and 
remains passionate about the people and profession she loves dearly.

My name is Juliana Nykolaiszyn and with me is Tanya Finchum. We’re 
with the Oklahoma Oral History Research Program at the OSU Library. 
Today is Friday, July 1, 2011, and we’re in Hugo, Oklahoma, 
interviewing B.K. Silverlake. Thank you for joining us today. 
 
You’re welcome. 
 
Well, we’d like to begin by having you tell us the year you were born, the 
city you were born in, and then give us a little background on your 
parents. 
 
All right. I was born in Ora, Indiana, a little bitty, dinky town, on August 
7, 1946, in my mother and father’s home on the kitchen table. That’s 
what I was told. (Laughs) My mother was Emma Duke, and my father 
was Raymond Duke. My mother had left the circus two weeks before I 
was born, had me, and went back out on the circus two weeks after I was 
born. I have two brothers. They’re actually my half brothers, but I’ve 
never ever distinguished that other than things like this. My mother was 
married to a man by the name of Bert Briggs prior to my father, and he 
was quite a bit older than my mother. They had the two boys, Leonard 
Lee Briggs, and Bertal Lee Briggs, Jr. And then Bert Briggs died and 
she married my father. My oldest brother, Leonard, was seventeen years 
older than myself. And Lee, the next one, was ten years older and he’s 
still alive. We were all raised on the circus. 
 
Bert Briggs was one of the more famous animal trainers of horses, dogs, 
and monkeys in his time, which I’m presuming would be around 1920s. 
In the Baraboo museum, they have him listed there in the history books 
somehow. I read some of it once. I was looking it up. My mother wasn’t 
in the circus business but somehow, I don’t even remember what she 
said, met Bert and married him. Then, of course, she started training

dogs and she worked the horses. She did dressage and did a few aerial 
acts. I’m not just sure what. I know she did swinging ladder.  
 
When Bert died she married my dad, who was Raymond Duke. He ran 
away from home. He was a town kid, too, but he ran away from home 
when he was seventeen and joined Ringling Brothers Circus. He started 
out as a roustabout and then he got involved with the elephants. Sport 
Matthews, I didn’t think I was going to remember his name, was one of 
the big elephant trainers back then and I guess he took a liking to my 
dad, and my dad did good with the elephants. So my dad worked the 
elephants. Not worked them, but he was a groom, I guess, more. So I 
don’t know if he ever worked in the ring with them or not. Well, he 
might have because he was good with elephants. I don’t know. I hate 
this part and I’m so thankful for you gals because there are things like 
that that I wish I knew. [I do know that when the elephant Modoc ran 
away they called my dad in to help catch him, and he did with the help 
of several loaves of bread.] 
 
But anyway, when he left there he became a clown, and I may as well 
bring the Silverlake family in about that time. Then they kind of all met 
somehow way back there, but I know my mother and Bert knew the 
Silverlake family, and my dad knew the Silverlake family. See, we’re 
really intertwined. It just doesn’t matter. (Laughs) Anyway, as time went 
on, the Silverlake family lived in southern Indiana, in a little bitty town 
called Medora. I was born in Ora and they were born in Medora. So 
what would happen is Brownie Silverlake would book indoor dates in 
the winter, in the schools or in buildings, and we would travel to 
southern Indiana and work all those dates for the circus. Then my dad 
would book schools and indoor dates in northern Indiana, and then they 
would come to northern Indiana, and we would do indoor dates up there. 
The Silverlake family is a pretty large family, seven boys and one girl; 
Marcus, Franklin, Myrna, Melvin, Jimmy, and Joe—no, only six of 
them. (Laughs) They just seem like more. Anyway, we all grew up 
together, and that was the Brownie Silverlake and Josephine Silverlake 
family.  
 
Prior to that, Brownie Silverlake, actually his real name was Melvin, 
Senior. His father was Archie Timberlake—Silverlake. See, I get it 
fouled up. Archie Silverlake—oh, boy. I can’t remember his dad’s name 
right now, Archie’s dad’s name. But anyway, they started out in 
vaudeville way, way, way back. But for my era that I know, and I knew 
Archie, was the Brownie Silverlake family and Josephine was his wife. 
They’ll never get this straight. (Laughter)Then, all right, Josephine’s 
father was Charles Fisher and he was a veterinarian, and back when the 
Depression was on and people couldn’t pay him, they would give him 
animals like pigs or ponies or ducks or chickens or whatever they had

for payment, for taking care of maybe their cow or something.  Oh, 
Lord, what’s Grandmammie’s name? Oh my gosh! It has always been 
Grandmammie.  
 
Anyway, they started training the animals and then their children were 
Josephine, Sarah, which we called Aunt Tootsie, and Arthur. So they 
would then work the animals and did contortion and just learned little 
tricks and things. They did like a little medicine-type show, I guess, and 
they worked into circus. Then he took out Fisher Brothers Circus back in 
the late ’20s, I believe it started. Josephine and Brownie met, and they 
got married, and that’s when their children were Marcus, Franklin, 
Myrna, Melvin, Jimmy and Joe. That’s more when I know that we did 
circuses together and then in the summertime, sometimes we’d be on the 
same circus for a season. They did a lot of fair dates, though, the 
Silverlakes did. Back then they’d have, like free acts on the fairs, and 
they would do a lot of them or they’d be in a circus, or it was like us in 
the wintertime, we’d work together. So we all just kind of grew up 
together, knew each other forever and ever and ever.  
 
Finally, in 1967, my dad was billposting for King Brothers Circus and 
he needed a helper. I think one of the fellows had to go home or 
something that was helping. He said, “Well, I’ll just call Melvin and 
have Melvin come up here,” and I’m like, “No, please don’t do that!” 
And he did, and Melvin came to work and billpost. The first night he got 
there, I’m not saying where he had to go to, but I had to go with him—
yes, I will—he was finding a bootlegger because he drank. (Laughter) 
And we got back and we just sat in there [in the car]. It was in Bowling 
Green, Kentucky, at the state park there, and we’re just sitting there B-S-
ing, talking. He says, “You know,” he said, “I think we ought to get 
married.” And I just laughed at him—and I mean really laughed! He 
kept it up, “No, I’m serious,” he’d say, “No.” He’ll tell you a different 
story, though, “I’m serious, we ought to get married,” and I’m like, and 
laugh. I was laughing so hard tears were rolling down my eyes. Well, he 
kept it up for three weeks and every time he’d mention it, I’d laugh. And 
finally, I thought, “Hmm. Let’s see. He’s serious. Well, we’ve always 
gotten along. All right, okay. I’ll marry you.” And that’s how we got 
married. (Laughs)  
 
And to write in that story line, I’ve got to tell you. He was in the air 
force for four years and I wrote to him diligently in the air force. I even 
made him angel food cakes and we sent them. I sent him a record one 
time that was the most popular record at that time in the United States. 
He was stationed in France or Germany, I don’t remember. And so I’d 
written and told him I was going to get that record and send it and it was 
the most popular song in the country at the time. So he, of course, had 
told all his buddies and they were all excited that they were going to get

Nykolaiszyn

this record, right? So I sent it, and it was the most popular. Let’s see, 
now I don’t remember the title exactly, but it was, “I dreamed I was in 
cowboy heaven, I died and went to cowboy heaven.” Anyway, it was 
horrible! He was so mad. He was ready to shoot me. (Laughter)  
 
There is a reason I’m telling you this story about us, how we got married 
and that I wrote to him in the air force. Well, on our first wedding 
anniversary, my mother threw a party for us and something came up 
about me always loving him. I said, “No, I haven’t! I haven’t ever been 
in love with him forever!” “Oh, yes,” and then Melvin, of course, got 
into it. “Yes, you have! You’ve always loved me!” and I’d say, “No, I 
don’t think so.” And he said, “I can prove it.” I said, “Oh, yeah?” 
“Yeah.” He went out in the shed, brought in—I can’t remember what 
they used to keep in it, a big, old tin with the lid on it, good sized. He 
opened it up and there were all the letters that I had written to him in the 
air force. He had kept them all. He said, “In every one of those letters, 
you’ve told me ‘I love you.’” That I loved him. I said, “I did not! I did 
no such thing. There’s no way that I said anything like that. I wrote 
them, I know what I said. I never ever told you I loved you in any one of 
those!” He said, “I don’t care, pick any of them.” And boy did I, and boy 
did I! (Laughter) I had no clue.  
 
Anyway, we were married for, I would say, twenty-six years and then 
we got divorced, and we are still the best of friends. But through the 
course of the time, his mother and father bought a circus called Clark 
and Walters Circus. I went and joined them on the circus, left my dad 
billposting and went with them because Melvin had left and went. His 
little brother came up—oh, I know what it was. Melvin hurt his leg. He 
messed up his knee, so Joe came up, his youngest brother, to fill in for 
him and while Melvin was home, Clark and Walters Circus actually 
showed Medora. Herb Walters, who owned it at that time and from the 
beginning, as far as I know, owned it, said, “Boy, I’d sell this thing in a 
heartbeat.”  They got talking and they bought it. Then Joe left and then 
Melvin kept calling. And you have to remember, back then, we didn’t 
have cell phones. We had to go to the pay phones and figure out ways to 
call and stuff, but he’d, “Well, you need to be here. You could help out. 
You know a lot about all this stuff.” And so anyway, I left and went, and 
then that fall is when we got married, in 1967, but prior to that, see, I’m 
getting ahead of myself. I haven’t even grown up yet, really. I was just 
born. (Laughter) 
 
Well, we’re going to jump back. 
 
Okay. 
 
So you’re a little girl, what circus are your parents with? I know they’re

kind of jumping around. 
 
Right, yes. The ones I can remember, and I should have brought that. 
I’ve got some written down. When I was really, really little, I 
remember—yep and there it goes, right out the window. Yes. Boy, that’s 
awful! It was just there. It really was. 
 
That’s all right. 
 
Now, I hate when I do this. 
 
Well, they were with several circuses while you were growing up. 
 
Yes, small circuses. Oh, yes.  
 
Would they always have the same type of jobs? 
 
No. 
 
Or do different things? 
 
No, you always do different things, usually. Well, my dad would clown, 
but after that, he billposted some. Then he started becoming a booking 
agent. Him and another gentleman by the name of Gene Christian were 
the two best, bar none, booking agents in this country for a small-type 
circus. Nobody could beat them. They just couldn’t figure out what they 
did, but they were good at it, just terrific at it. So a lot of the times, when 
we were on a circus, Daddy would be—well, let me back that up. Let’s 
say he’s billposting. Well, my mother would billpost, too, while I 
walked right with her every step of the way. Then, if he was booking, 
Mother and I would have to sit in the car and he’d have to go in to see a 
sponsor to talk to them and explain. Maybe he’d be in there for five 
seconds. Maybe he’d be in there for half an hour. So we just kind of—
there we were in the car. I always hated it, the booking part, just sitting 
there waiting for him when I was little.  
 
Then it got to a point, I suppose that would’ve been Adams Brothers, 
somewhere in that vicinity. I would have been about eight or nine, 
maybe, and he went and started to work for a man named Bill Griffith, 
who owned a newspaper in Appleton, Wisconsin, and took a circus out. 
He liked the circus, and so he did with a partner, Little Bob Stevens, 
who was already a circus guy. (Laughs) So Daddy would go booking, 
and Mother and I would be on the show. We’d stay on the show, and 
she’d clown or whatever and I would do whatever as a kid, just fill in 
here, there, whatever. On the one circus, Leonard Brothers, that’s the 
little one, back when I was about seven years old, I had to play the 
 
 
9
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
records and walk in spec so I could eat in the cookhouse. I didn’t 
perform at that time when I was just little, but I had to do that to be able 
to [eat in the cookhouse]. I had to know the records, had to put them on, 
take them off, for the timing, and was there for both shows every day.  
 
Then my dad started to work for Bill Griffith with the Adams Brothers 
and then it was Adams and Sells, and Sells Brothers and then it became 
Birnam Brothers, which was the nicest of the circuses he had. He just 
kind of built it up. I was more teenaged-type, twelve, thirteen. About 
nine I was probably, when Daddy started working for him and then I 
would have odd jobs. Bill was always putting me to work somewhere as 
I grew up. Back then, we didn’t have big semi concession trailers. We 
had a tent, little tents, and it was called number one stand, number two 
stand, number three. It was like popcorn, cotton candy—I mean, cotton 
candy in one, popcorn in another one, and then cold drinks, and then 
maybe sometimes they’d have a snow cone, maybe number four stand, 
but that’s how they were deemed. So Bill would say, “Okay, you’re 
going to run the cotton candy stand.” So I’d get it all lined out, get it 
going smooth, how I could handle it and get it up, get it down, do the 
job, blah, blah, blah. Well, then he’d pull me off of that job. “Well, I 
need you to shovel elephant shit. Our shit shoveler left.” So B.K. gets to 
shovel elephant shit. And I’m, “God!” So then, “You need to sell 
tickets.” After I got older, “I want you here to help me check up with 
this sponsor.” I’d get every one of these jobs just down pat, just working 
good, I’d think, “Man, I’ve got it smooth, I’ve got my routine,” and he’d 
pull me off and have me do something else.  
 
One time, after I was a teenager and I had my driver’s license, I had to 
go ahead of the show. He had heralds and he’d made arrangements with 
the sponsors and they would get young kids, eight of them in my car. I 
would drop four here at this block and they would do the circle of the 
block. One would go one way, and then I’d drive up and four more, and 
they’d hand out these, take them to the houses, to the doors, put them on 
the doorknob or whatever. Then I’d circle back, pick those up, and then 
we just kept doing that. I did that for a while and then it was, “Well, I 
need you to go billposting.” Well, then I’d have to go billpost. Of 
course, I knew how to do that. But when I was in high school—because 
I stayed home. I went to school. Mother and Daddy would leave and I 
would stay with my great-aunt and uncle who were more like my 
grandparents.  
 
One year, I decided, “Well, I’m going to learn how to do trapeze.” So I 
hung a trapeze rig and my mother helped me, and we hung it between 
two trees in the yard, northern Indiana, freezing cold. (Laughs) So every 
night from school I’d go home, hang it up, practice, take it down, and go 
into the house. But I did learn how to do trapeze. I also wanted to be a

beautician and my aunt and uncle were going to pay for me to go to 
Vogue College. I was just ecstatic about doing that and that was my 
senior year in high school, because my father came home and that winter 
he said, “I really wish you’d go on the show just this first season after 
school anyway,” and, like me, “Well, I ought to do something my father 
wants me to do.” So I gave up going to beauty college and I went on the 
circus and did a lousy trapeze act. (Laughs) Well, I did. I’m not lying. It 
was.  
 
There were a couple of people on the show and they helped me and I got 
a little better. The only thing I was ever proud of on my trapeze—
because it was just a mediocre, single trapeze act. I loved to do it, but I 
didn’t have many great tricks. I had one, what they call a bird’s nest that 
you do up in the ropes and then I would come down and drop to my 
knee, but it would look like I was falling. I always liked to do that 
because prior to that, I did little tricks and I could hear the audience, the 
people saying, “Oh, I could do that.” And I’m like, “Yes, you could.” 
(Laughs) I said, “But just wait a minute.” (Laughs) And then I’d scare 
them and then I had them.  
 
My other great accomplishment, to me, for my trapeze act, the only two 
things I ever thought was any good was I did a good ankle drop. You 
didn’t realize that I was doing an ankle drop and for the life of me, God 
has to love me because I never fell out, but I would wait until the last 
second to catch. One of the premier, most wonderful trapeze artists in 
our country, Jo Ann Jennier, at that time came and visited, which I knew 
her since I was a little bitty girl. When I came out of the act, she says, 
“Oh, my God, B.K., I would love to be able to do an ankle drop like 
that!” You talk about proud (Laughs), because she was excellent, 
terrific. (Laughs) But anyway, so then I did trapeze. We were on that 
show for quite awhile until one evening—and like I said, we’ll go back 
to Bill always changing up my jobs, continually. It just drove me crazy. 
I’d get so mad, but I’d think, “Well, my dad needs the job, so I can’t say 
anything.”  
 
This one winter, probably, I guess, it was the year after high school, 
another fellow by the name of Billy Sheets who was a real character, and 
I mean a real character, we made this wardrobe. Now, you have to 
remember, back in the ’50s and ’60s, the wardrobe was not skimpy at 
all. Okay. Well, we had to have this calypso outfit and all it was, was a 
strapless bra with elastic around the neck and trunks. Well, I’ve always 
been big-chested, always been bashful. I did not want to wear that thing 
for love nor money. So we had that. It was really, a true calypso with 
very wild colors. We had big, puffy sleeves that snapped on. We had a 
big, calypso skirt and a basket of fruit on our head for swinging ladder. 
We also had for cold, nasty nights or rainy nights, we had this nice 
 
 
11
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
leotard with long sleeves and a long full body and I loved it. But I’m 
going to tell this part first.  
 
On the first night that we had to work, I had to wear that wardrobe, the 
calypso wardrobe. I hated it because we had to go to the back of the ring, 
go to the right, take a sleeve off and drop it, go to the front, take a sleeve 
off and drop it—there was something else we had on—oh, the vest. The 
skirt or the vest, one of them, we’d take—it had to be the skirt—and 
drop it. Then when we came back into the ladder, we had to take the vest 
off. Well, it was like doing a strip tease act. I’m like ugh! (Gasps) Then, 
of course, we had to give our beautiful basket of fruit to our swinging 
guy that swung the ladder, who I was so lucky to have Billy Sheets as 
mine. The first night I was starting out to do the little routine, and he’s 
standing at the back of the ring hollering, “Give them a bump and a 
grind, baby!” And I’m like, “Oh, God!” (Laughter) So I kept telling him, 
“There’s no way I’m doing the foot loop because I’m going to fall out. I 
can’t, I’m big. It’s a strapless. I’m not doing the foot loop.” “Yes, 
you’ve got to do the foot loop.” I said, “No, I don’t. I am not doing the 
foot loop! I will do the rest of the routine. Then I will sit and pose for the 
rest of them, but I’m not doing the foot loop.”  
 
Well, he’s a turd because just as it came time, he said something—I wish 
to God I could remember, but I can’t—and I went into the foot loop 
anyway. Well, of course, the minute I hung down, what does he do then? 
“You’re falling out!” he’s hollering. And I’m like trying to hang on and 
do my tricks and keep my arms over my boobs. Anyway, I got used to it 
and then it got so it didn’t bother me at all. 
 
But, now, on past that story, cold, sick, oh, we’d had horrible weather. I 
was sick with a cold. Well, the first show, he made me—made us all, I 
mean, not just me. We had to wear the calypso outfit and I said, “Billy,” 
I said, “I’m so sick.” And it was rainy, icky, and cold. I said, “Billy, 
please. Can’t we wear the leotards?” “No, no, no. You have to wear the 
calypso.” So I went in and worked, but I was so sick and I thought, 
“There’s no way the second show,” because back then, we did shows at 
six o’clock and then at eight o’clock. So it was pretty doggone chilly by 
the time it got eight o’clock for us to do the next show. So I went and I 
said, “Look, I’m wearing the leotard this next show. I’m not going to 
wear this thing.” “Yes, you are! You’re going to wear it!” I said, “Well 
I’m not wearing it and if you think you’re going to make me, you’re 
crazy because I won’t work!”  
 
So I went on to the trailer and I didn’t work. Mother’s saying, “You 
have to get dressed. You have to go do it.” I said, “No, I don’t. If he 
doesn’t come over here and tell me I can wear it [the leotard], I am not 
doing it. I’m not going in there. I’m quitting. I’ll quit first! I’m sick. I’m

not doing it.” So he didn’t come and I quit. I had to go the next day and 
tell Bill Griffith that I was quitting. “Well, we don’t want you to go.” I 
said, “I don’t care. That’s it. I’ve had it to here. (Gestures)  [You just 
hired me because of my dad.]” Then I had to tell his wife, Delores, and 
she stood—I can still see her. Now, that’s a long, long time ago, the 
most wonderful lady in the world. (Cries) She’s standing there ironing, 
“B.K., please don’t go.” I said, “Delores, I’ve got to. I can’t do this. I 
can’t take it anymore.” “But please, we love you, we don’t want you to 
go,” and all that, but anyway, she just passed away a few years ago. 
Sorry, [I’m crying].  
 
That’s okay. 
 
Oh, I do that a lot. (Laughter) So anyway, I left. Oh, let’s see. What 
happened after that? I left. Oh, I went to work for my oldest brother. 
That was a farce. (Laughs) He was a mechanic. He was a genius 
mechanic, now, I will give him that. You can go out here to the [Mount 
Olivet] cemetery and you’ll see Deacon and Davey’s tombstones. When 
my brother was like six, seven years old, he could tear a car down and 
put it back together. He was just born with the gift, but Deacon and 
Davey helped him, incorporated it, to make him. He was just 
unbelievable. “Your car’s broken down? Oh, wait a minute. Let me see. 
I can use this. Yes, that’ll work,” and he’d fix it just like that. (Snaps) 
Listen to it, tell you what’s wrong with it. It was just amazing. You go 
back to the Silverlakes and Josephine, which was my mother-in-law 
then, later, but when we were kids, she’d gather up stuff, toasters, radio. 
Whatever was broken, she had it in a pile, so when Leonard came 
through he could fix it. (Laughs) 
 
How many siblings did you have? 
 
Just the two brothers. 
 
Okay. 
 
Yes. 
 
When you were doing all these various jobs, were you getting paid? 
Even when you were younger? 
 
Oh, yes. Yes, you get paid. 
 
No matter how old you were? 
 
Oh, yes. Yes.

Did you get that or would your parents get that? 
 
No. Well, I got it. Some parents, they got it, but I always got mine—it 
wouldn’t be much. Maybe I got a dollar a week, when I was real little. 
As a matter of fact, bringing that up, when my son was little, like two or 
three, talking fairly well and moving around pretty good and he was 
clowning with his grandmother, my mother in the show, he came to the 
office one day and he says, “Mom, where’s my money?” And I went, 
“Oh, yeah. He’s working, he’s clowning. Yeah. I need to pay him so he 
knows that you work, you get paid, duh! I wonder why I didn’t think of 
that sooner.” So from then on he got paid every week. Every year, I 
raised him a dollar or two or whatever. Now, he’ll tell you, when he got 
older, a lot of times we used his money, too, to keep the show going. 
(Laughs) Stuff like that, but yes, most of the kids, you got paid. Now, 
when I told you back when I was—I’m pretty sure I was seven there, 
when I was doing the records and stuff. Now, I didn’t get paid except 
that I had the privilege to eat in the cookhouse. So that was, sort of, my 
pay. If not, Mother and Daddy would have had to have paid for me to 
have eaten in the cookhouse.  
 
Well, at that time what kind of living arrangements were you in? 
 
Well, we had a trailer. It was a trailer, an old, silver thing. It had a little 
dinette in the front. It had a real ice box where you had to put ice in it to 
keep stuff cold. I don’t remember if we had a stove in there or not, 
maybe two burners or something, and then a bed and a closet on each 
side just in front of the bed. That was it—and a little thunder mug. 
(Laughs) You know what that is, right? 
 
No idea. No. 
 
That’s one of those little potties that you tinkle in and carry it out. 
(Laughs) 
 
Well, where would you and your brothers sleep? 
 
Well, see, my, the thing of it was— 
 
Oh, they were older. 
 
Yes. See, my oldest brother, when I was born, he was seventeen. He was 
already driving semis over the road. Now, Lee was ten, but by the 
time—well, but Lee was there when I was little. But like the dinette 
thing made down and him and I slept there. But then it wasn’t long, 
because seven years and he was out and gone and driving the semi or 
working and whatever, too.

What about shower and bath time? 
 
Oh, you have a little tub thing. It looks like a bucket that you carry water 
and you wash. Yes, it’s amazing if you take a gallon jug of water and 
pour it, you don’t use much. But that’s how we did. We carried the 
water. We had a water truck, usually. Sometimes there’d be water on the 
lot. It’s not like today. Or, a lot of times I went down to the creek and 
brought water up for Mother. But there were no indoor potties in any 
trailers. I don’t even know if the big bosses had that. (Laughs) Even 
growing up at home, in Indiana, we had a hand pump. I grew up with a 
hand pump and an outhouse, back in the backyard.  
 
An outhouse? 
 
An outhouse. That’s the name. My oldest brother married—he was 
married a few times. This one girl he married was from Chicago. I’ve 
got to tell you since you brought it up. He brought her home, of course. I 
don’t know, she was getting water, anyway. That’s all I can really truly 
remember about it. She was pumping the pump. We had a pump inside 
the house. That’s luxury. So she’s pumping and all of the sudden she’s 
looking, and she’d pump a little bit, and she’d look some more, and 
she’d look some more, and she’d pump a little bit. She started feeling 
around on it, and finally—I’m sure it was Mother. I don’t think I did—
but Mother said, “Pam, what are you looking for?” “Well, how do you 
get the hot water?” (Laughs) She came from Chicago. They have all that 
good stuff. She said, “How do you get the hot water out of it?” (Laughs) 
 
When you were younger, growing up on the lot, were there rules that 
you had to follow? Were there certain things your mom said, “Don’t 
do,” or certain things the owners never wanted you to do? 
 
Well, when we were real little we weren’t allowed to go out when they 
were putting up the tent. We had to stay clear away from that. If the 
trucks are moving, you’d better be way the heck away from them. The 
electric cords on the ground, you can watch me walk any time you want 
to, I will never step on one because we were taught to step over them. If 
there was a break or something we could get electrocuted, I guess, was 
their thought, but we weren’t allowed to, could not step on a light cord. 
Let’s see. You’re not supposed to hang on the guy lines of the tent that 
guyed the tent out. You’re not supposed to hang on them. But what we 
could do, though, which was lots of fun, when we’d have a storm and 
the tent’s blowing up and down, the poles would kind of go up and 
down. Well, at the bottom of the quarter poles would be a rope and 
that’s how they’d hook it and pull it up. Well, we kids would put our feet 
in those ropes while the storm was on, we’d ride the poles up and down.

(Laughs)  
 
I don’t know, I don’t really remember a lot. We just seemed to know. It 
wasn’t like, “Don’t go do this,” or “Don’t go do that,” “Stay away from 
this,” or “Stay away from that.” Now, I’m old enough, and I was young 
enough, that I still remember working men were not allowed to talk to 
me. Working men were not allowed to even say—and if we happened to 
be walking and pass each other, they had better not say, “Hello,” “Hi,” 
nada, nothing. You were not allowed to speak to them whatsoever. If 
somebody made the mistake they were taken out back and kind of talked 
to pretty strictly, and so they didn’t talk to you.  
 
What about in the cookhouse? Were you able to sit at the same tables? 
 
No. You have separate tables. From stories my father and my father-in-
law have told me, and Grandpa Archie and them, they used to have 
stewardesses or stewards and they had tablecloths on some of the shows, 
the nicer shows. But they sat and they were actually the—yep, there we 
go again. It’s not the right word, but the office people, they had a table. 
Concession people had a table. Performers had a table. Elephant people 
had a table or animal people, usually it was, and working men had a 
table. And trust me, those poor working men were at the back of the tent 
every time. I don’t remember there ever being the stewards or 
stewardesses, but they would wait on you, pretty much. But now, with 
me growing up, it was the staff—there we go—the staff table, 
concessionaires’ table, performers’ table, and pretty much it was more 
animal and working men tables when I grew up. Not so much separate 
there. But that working man or that concession man had better never sit 
down at the staff table, better never sit down at the performers’ table, or 
we had a little chat out back of the tent. (Laughs) 
 
Were meals the buffet style or cafeteria style or family style? 
 
No. Any that I’ve ever been at or as long as I remember, you would go 
up and they would fill your plate. Now, most of the time they would 
write a menu. We’re having pork chops, baked potatoes, green beans, 
corn, carrots, salad, whatever, and then you could pick once you got up 
to the window and tell them what you want, but they would put it on 
your plate. So sort of cafeteria style, but not to where you just said, “I 
want this,” or “I want that,” and a lot of them, mostly, they put it on your 
plate and you ate it or you threw it out. Oh, yes. (Laughs) Drinks, some 
shows would have like Kool-Aid or they’d have a big water cooler, and 
if you wanted a soda or something like that, you had to buy it. Let’s see.  
 
That was for all three meals—breakfast, lunch and dinner?

Well, we only ever had, truly, two meals. The three meals is the morning 
you get up, you have coffee and doughnuts or the equivalent to 
doughnuts. That’s it. That’s breakfast. You get to the next town, then 
you have a true breakfast and you would have, like one day, maybe, 
fried eggs and bacon or ham or whichever. Not two or three choices, just 
one, and maybe potatoes or oatmeal or something like that. That would 
be, usually, around ten o’clock. Now, I’m telling you when I grew up, 
because it has all changed now. I’m like, “I don’t believe this,” but 
anyway, ten o’clock. So I have a built in time clock. At ten o’clock, I’m 
getting hungry and I know, I can tell you every day, it’s almost ten or 
it’s just a little after ten. At four o’clock, then you had the supper meal, 
which would be whatever they just fixed that night. It could be spaghetti 
or it could be ham and beans or it could be a big lavish meal, not too 
often. I understand you’ve interviewed Lucy [Loyal] already so I know 
what she told you if she talked about my cookhouse.  
 
She has not.  
 
What!? 
 
She did not talk about your cookhouse. 
 
That’s it! She went on, get out of here. 
 
But we’re not really done with her yet, so… 
 
Okay. 
 
We didn’t finish her. 
 
Oh, all right.  
 
But we’ll have to ask her about your cookhouse. 
 
Please, ask her about my cookhouse.  
 
You’re making that mental note. 
 
Yes. I will see her tomorrow night. (Laughter) 
 
Okay. So we’re up to the point where you quit. 
 
Oh. Oh, yes. And I went with my brother for a while. 
 
Were your parents with your brother?

No, they were still on the show. They stayed on the show, Mother did. 
Mother was on the show, Daddy was booking by that time. I was like 
right at eighteen, I guess, probably eighteen when I quit. Of course, she 
didn’t want me to go, that whole thing and all that. What happened? I 
can’t even remember. I’m lost in there for that point. Anyway, then we 
all were back together again at some point down the road. (Laughs) I 
can’t remember. 
 
Another town, another circus. 
 
Yes, another day, another circus. Hmm, okay. It must have been—all 
right, after that year…I quit, I went on, and that was cool. I came back 
that winter and Bill took, Bill—I don’t know the truth on this one—
whether he sold the circus to Dick Johnson and Louie McNeese, Birnam 
Brothers, and they tried to take it out. Well, Bill made a deal with Daddy 
to go ahead and book it, probably because Dick and Louie owed Bill the 
money for the circus and I would billpost. So my cousin Rosemary, 
who’d never been anywhere around a circus, went with me billposting. 
 
We should probably say what that is. 
 
Oh, billposting is putting up the posters in the store windows, different 
sizes. When I was little, we had huge, huge pictorial posters that went up 
with beautiful lions or tigers or elephants or the horses. The largest ones 
for putting in store windows was a one sheet, called a one-sheet. Now, 
you’re going to want to know what size that was. It was about like that. 
(Gestures arms open wide) I can’t remember how big. They were big, 
trust me. They were big. Then you had posters that had some pictorials. 
They were called half-sheets, uprights, and then you had half-sheet flats. 
A half-sheet upright would be an extra large, but the shape of a regular 
writing paper if you were going to sit and write a letter, but big. Then a 
half-sheet flat would be if you turned it sideways and hung it. Then we 
had panels, which were long, narrow posters. Then we had date paper, 
which were the same things. You’d have the one-sheets, the half-sheet 
uprights, the half-sheet flats, and the panels.  
 
Most of the time, on any major bill crew, there was also the cardboard 
posters. They’re just the cardboard ones, the smaller ones. Of course, 
back then, we had downtowns that were thriving and somebody would 
put those just downtown because they were smaller windows, usually, or 
you would lap over each other. If it was just a little window, you 
wouldn’t even go in with a big poster. I can remember very vividly, on 
the big posters, I had 125 every day to put out. You best put them up 
somewhere and that was ten of those gigantic ones and whatever the 
other figures they were, but it was horrible. (Laughs) It really was. We 
probably had fifty of the half-sheet flats, fifty of the half-sheet uprights,

and ten of the one-sheets. I remember there were ten of those. I 
remember that vividly. Then, probably, the fifteen were the panels. 
Those went somewhere every day, in a window and at the top, and you 
carried sticks. I don’t know if they were one by ones, but they were long 
and on the end, you would put a piece of rubber and tape it so that you 
would take the poster and fold it over that stick. That was another 
horrible thing back then. We had a little plastic thing that was actually a 
cigarette case, but they cut it. There were stickers about two inches by 
two inches, maybe something like that. 
 
Like a stamp? 
 
Yes and you had to lick them and put them on the poster. Then you 
would fold that poster over, take the stick, put it clear up at the top of 
that window, and then—we had two sticks, actually. One with the rubber 
piece and one that was shaved flat, kind of pointed—or what you call 
that? Not pointed, but… 
 
Like a wedge? 
 
Yes, kind of like a wedge. Then you’d rub those stickers down across, 
and that was billposting. What they do today is…(gestures quick and 
careless), and I get upset when a billposter says, “Oh, they don’t want 
them in their windows.” I said, “They didn’t want them in their windows 
when I was ten years old, either, but we put them in there.” (Laughs) 
And that’s the truth. They didn’t.  
 
Well, if they didn’t, did you do it anyway? I mean, did you actually do it 
anyway? 
 
No. You just found another place. Oh, yes. And then we had billposters, 
they also had what they called a tack hit, and that, if you could find a big 
enough, like somebody’s side of a barn or their garage, maybe the paint 
was chipping, you could spot them. So you’d go to the house and you’d 
say, “We’d like to staple some posters up here. We’ll give you a couple 
of free tickets to the circus.” And those you would put up, they were 
called three-sheeters, or you had six-sheeters, eight-sheeters, I think 
that’s about right, all of them. But those would be like a collage—that’s 
not maybe right—but it would be where the poster was a big, beautiful 
scene of the circus, but it was in three sections. So you had to staple this 
one and match it for the pictures to look good, but when it was done it 
was huge. Then, of course, you’d put the date posters up either below or 
above or both or cover the whole thing if you could get away with it to 
make a real big splash.  
 
Then we had what we call dobs. Don’t ask. I don’t know where all these

names came from. (Laughs) And what those were, now, that’s when you 
got into the artfulness of billposting. There would be like a cement wall 
or a wooden wall, but it was better if it was more of a smooth-type area. 
What it actually consisted of, years ago, we used to wallpaper the rooms 
in our homes, not paint them, and there was a paste that you used. Well, 
you took that and you took these huge posters and you mixed this paste 
and [using] a big, old brush you slopped it all over it. Then you rolled it 
up and took your little sticks again and you pushed it up, praying you 
didn’t tear a hole in it, because it would get soft from the moisture of the 
paste, and then you would smooth it all out. Then you had a big, like a 
push broom, per se, type looking thing and then you had to smooth it 
out, no wrinkles, because that picture had to be pretty when it dried. 
Those are called dobs.  
 
Did someone come by and check to make sure you’d done all this? 
 
No. But when the show got there, they’d see them. Oh, and then we have 
what we call manager’s paper. I forgot about that. That’s the best part of 
all. We’re going to show at the fairgrounds in this town. So you have a 
first of May, or somebody that’s just trying to show off for the boss. We 
call that manager’s paper because you’re six miles out of town at the 
fairgrounds, but they’ve got twenty pieces of paper hung around the 
fairgrounds and who’s seeing it? It’s not advertising. So they’d call that 
manager’s paper because they’d want the manager to know they’d been 
working. (Laughs) Talking about that just reminded me of my mother-
in-law, because Jack Bennett red-lighted a bunch of paper over the side 
of a mountain one time. He didn’t want to put it up, and she just 
happened to pull in, her and Joe had stopped for a rest and she’s looking 
over and there’s the paper down [the side of the mountain]. (Laughter) 
But it’s called red-lighting. You get rid of something, you red-lighted it. 
(Laughs) 
 
Is there anything else we need to know about billposting? 
 
You had to circus the paper. It’s not anything major, but, as I said, we 
had different pictorial paper that we did, and there would be different 
pictures. Maybe we’d have four different pictures. So what you had to 
do every night was what we called circusing the paper. As you took the 
paper, one picture, put it, next picture on top, the next picture on top, the 
next picture on top, then start again. I’m sure there’s a modern term for 
that, but we called it you had to circus the paper. So every night we had 
to do that. They did that for the reason of when you’re walking down the 
street, you’re seeing different pictures. You’re not seeing just the same 
picture each time.  
 
While we’re still talking about that, how did they transport these?

Oh, back then it was called a panel truck, which is a little taller than a 
suburban, usually, no windows. Then we had, usually, like a bread van 
or a UPS van truck, and they would build racks in there kind of on an 
angle down towards the wall, with the high point coming out. The 
different posters were always put in there except for the date paper, and 
they stayed in the box that it got shipped in. If I remember right, you’d 
usually get about a week’s worth of paper at the time, and then the last 
date that you’re going to do would be on the bottom. So as you’re doing 
the date paper, that comes off.  
 
Oh, and I forgot about the tails. Oh, yes! I forgot about that part. Yes. I 
wonder why, because I hated it! (Laughter) On the pictorial posters, at 
the bottom, they would make strips with the date and the sponsor and the 
show grounds just like on the dated paper, because all the dated paper 
was just the information and the date of the show. So then what you had 
to do was take one of these long staples and staple the tail onto each of 
these pictorials for the certain town or a certain date. So you got those 
shipped into you all the time, but you had an enormous amount of all the 
pictorials, because they were just standard. I forgot about that part.  
 
Now, we did eventually evolve from the little sticky things, from putting 
them up, to masking tape. Now, it has kind of evolved to scotch tape. It 
was funny because one store will say, “I don’t want that masking tape on 
my windows, here, use my scotch tape,” and then the next store will say, 
“Oh, no. Don’t use that scotch tape. Here, use my masking tape.” 
(Laughs) I used to get a kick out of that because it was like, “Okay, 
whatever you want, we’ll handle it.” Then, a lot of times, if you can get 
a good hit by a door where they’re coming in and out, you’ll back the 
paper, and that’s where you put it up so that in the window they can see 
it coming in or they can see it going out. So it’s like a double hit.  
 
And you call them hits? 
 
Yes. Oh, yes. They’re hits. See that hit. And then, going back to when I 
was young, well, it was when I was old enough to really be out there 
billposting. Father, my dad, would get up at five o’clock. By five thirty, 
we better be on the street, but all we did was drive around town, 
checking it out. “Oh, there’s a good tack hit. I’m going to try and get 
that for a dob.” “Now, you see those windows? You ought to be able to 
get at least two of those one-sheets in there.” [If there was an empty, 
which is a closed up store with large windows, then you would cover the 
entire window. You had to get permission and a key to get it, and the 
sponsor would help with that.] And he’d just scope out the town in the 
morning, early, then we’d go back to wherever we was parked for that 
night, you get your—oh and there’s another word, term—you get your

hod of paper. Each one of us had a hod, and like I said, I can remember 
vividly, I had 125 pieces and that put together is called a hod of paper. 
Boy. We’ve got—why didn’t we say, “Hey, get your stack of papers and 
posters.” (Laughter) I never realized. I’m telling all these names for 
everything. 
 
H-O-D? 
 
I guess. I never spelled it. I never have. It’s just a hod of paper. You 
guys are going to have to figure that one out on your own. (Laughs)  
 
Well, we got onto this because you were telling us about when you quit 
that circus, you were billposting.  
 
Right, oh, okay. And then that’s when the Silverlakes bought Clark and 
Walters Circus, and then I went there. Well, I don’t know, they’re silly 
stories. You don’t want silly stories, do you? Okay. Well, as I told you, 
the Silverlakes, I grew up with them. Matter of fact, there was how 
many of them, five boys, I guess, and one girl. All five boys wanted to 
marry me, per se. Not really. Marcus would say, “Well, if I was a little 
younger, I’d marry her.” And Franklin was, “Well, I’d marry her, but 
I’m already married.” Melvin never said it and Jimmy never said it, but 
they all—oh, there’s another one. And Joe, he said, “But if you’ll wait 
until I’ll grow up, I’ll marry you,” and just silliness. It was not 
meaningful, but we all kidded. One time, Marcus, I always looked older 
than I am, always, all my life. When I was fifteen I looked twenty-five. 
It’s no sweat. But I went to church with Marcus one morning and he 
went back to church that night, and the gals at the church wanted to 
know where his girlfriend was. He said, “She’s only fifteen. She ain’t 
my girlfriend.” He’s the oldest. (Laughs) But, okay, I’m back off the 
subject again. At that point, it was Brownie and Josephine Silverlake 
bought Clark and Walters Circus. 
 
Now, had they owned circuses before? 
 
No. They never had. 
 
So this was their first? 
 
They had just been performers all their lives. So then Melvin kept 
saying, “You need to get here. We need you here. We need you to come. 
The girls can’t wait for you to come.” And Jimmy was engaged to a girl, 
Marlyn. That’s Melvin’s next younger brother. He was engaged to 
Marlyn. And then her sister was on the show, who Melvin had dated, 
Sharon. Then Melvin’s sister Myrna was on the show, and then all the 
boys, of course, everybody, the family. When they bought the show,

some people stayed with the show, some just left because the Silverlakes 
are buying it, what do they know? They’re not going to take a chance or 
whatever. I don’t know what their reasoning exactly was, but anyhow.  
 
So Melvin kept, “You need to come. You need to come. The girls need 
you. Myrna’s wanting you to get here and you can do this and you can 
do that. And besides, you can…” That was it. “You can get here and you 
can show Marlyn and Sharon how to do this stuff.” And I’d say, “Well, 
Myrna can show them. Joe can show them. Franklin can, any of you can 
show them how to do this.” “No, because you know how to do it the 
best. You need to be here and you need to be showing them how to do 
this stuff.” I said, “Well, Melvin, I can’t leave my dad stranded.” I said, 
“You’ve got to wait until he finds somebody to replace me.” Well, they 
just, “You need to be here.” Every time we’d talk on the phone. “You 
need to be here and show these girls how to do this. Sharon can’t wait 
for you to get here so you’ll show her how to do the swinging ladder or 
the trapeze or whatever.” Finally, I was able and I joined the show.  
 
I get there and first one I met was Marlyn. Jimmy came up, just on the 
lot, and they were together and Jimmy introduced me, and she just kind 
of, “Oh, hi. How are you?” And I thought, “Okay, that’s cool.” So then I 
saw Myrna, who I have worshipped. I mean, I used to follow her around 
with little puppy dog eyes, “Oh boy!” Wherever Myrna was, I wanted to 
be. So here’s Myrna, “Hi, Myrna!” “Hello. What are you doing here? 
What do you want?” I went, “Oh, well, she’s just in a bad mood. 
Whatever.” So I went around, did a little bit more. Finally, I went in the 
tent and Sharon was practicing swinging ladder and Joe, the youngest 
brother, was helping her to learn. I just walked up because I’m so 
bashful (Ha!), and I said, “Hi, you must be Sharon. I’m B.K.” “Oh,” she 
said, “Oh, my god! I’m so glad you’re finally here so you can teach me 
how to do this!” [I said, “I don’t know how to do any of this.” Sharon 
turned white and almost fell out of the ladder.] And the light bulb went 
on. Myrna was mad at me. Marlyn just kind of gave me a cool welcome. 
Melvin has been telling them, “Wait until B.K. gets here, she’ll show 
you how to do it.” So they hated me before I ever arrived.  
 
I went to Myrna, I said, “Myrna, what is the deal? You know me! You 
know I don’t know that much! You know more than I do! You’re older! 
You know better! Why did you let him do that?” They did not like me 
because of Melvin. “Oh, wait until B.K. gets here. She’ll show you how 
to do that.” And he’s telling me, “You need to get here so you can show 
them.” He did it. Honest. Swear to God. You can ask any of them. So 
anyhow, we went on, and this is where my Bill Griffith comes back into 
play. It wasn’t long after that, that I realized that I was going—oh, I had 
forgotten. When I quit Bill Griffith’s show, I told him, I said, “The only 
reason you’ve ever hired me is because of my dad, anyway.” I forgot

that main, key point. So after they bought the show and we all worked 
towards making it work, but they had mostly been just performers. Now, 
they had cousins that did some concessions and so they did that, and 
trying to make all the other stuff work and go.  
 
Then I realized, “Bill, I have to bite my tongue. I owe you an enormous 
apology.” He had been teaching me every aspect of the business, and I 
mean every aspect. And when I say my job was shoveling elephant shit, 
that’s what it was. I was no better than any working man. So he really 
taught me by learning, by doing, and that helped with me knowing. Of 
course, I got a lot of flak from it because then I was the know-it-all, and 
I was trying to tell them how to do it and all this, and that and they’ll 
still tell you that. But they’ll still tell you they all love me very much, 
and I love them very much. But it was just the situation. I just happened 
to know because Bill had taught me. I knew how to handle the sponsors. 
I knew how to, whatever, part of it.  
 
Melvin finally told his mother that we were getting married and she 
pitched a fit. So Melvin and I left the show. (Laughs) My mom and dad 
were there, of course, by that time, which was in the fall, and we were in 
Sulphur, Louisiana, by Lake Charles in a state park. No, Daddy was 
down there billposting for King Brothers so we went back to work for 
them. That’s what it was. So we finished billposting this one day and 
Melvin says, “Well, let’s go get our license to get married at the 
courthouse.” So we did. I don’t know why I wasn’t there right by my 
father and Melvin, but when we all went out of the courthouse, Daddy 
says, “Come on, we’ve got to hurry up so you can go get married.” I 
said, “Daddy, we just got the license. We’ve got to wait three days.” 
“No, no. Me and Melvin fixed that. They waived all that for us.”  
 
So we left the courthouse, after working, sweating, in the hot sun, in 
Sulphur, Louisiana, billposting, we left there, went back to the state park 
to the trailer, got Mother, I grabbed a set of clothes, then from the state 
park we had to go into town to the judge’s chambers. So on the way I 
changed clothes, at least, to get married in. The funny part Melvin did 
was the judge said, “Do you have her parents’, her father’s approval?” or 
something like that. And Melvin said, “Well, who do you think that is 
with the shotgun?” (Laughter) We got married and that was it. We just 
went on our merry way. We got back in with the family, and we went 
the next year with Clark and Walters. Let’s see, that was ’67, ’68, ’69, 
and ’70. We were, all the family, basically, together. They’d argue and 
fight, and come and go, and that type of stuff. They had a huge family 
and they liked to fight and argue, and B.K. was always there trying to 
stop it, and then B.K. was in trouble. (Laughs) 
 
How long did your parents have the show?

Not my parents, Melvin’s parents. 
 
Oh, Melvin’s parents.  
 
Well, okay. ’67, ’68, ’69, ’70 it was Clark and Walters. Late fall, early 
winter of ’70—maybe it was when we went home for Christmas or I 
don’t know. We were up north at my parents’ and went back down south 
and Mom said—Melvin’s mom. Okay. Mother is my mother, Mom is 
Melvin’s mother. That’s how I always—Dad was Melvin’s dad and 
Daddy was my dad. (Laughs) It’s a mess. Oh, well, it’s worse because 
it’s Melvin, Melvin, Melvin, Melvin. (Laughter) But anyway, let’s see, 
in ’70, when we got there, she says, “Well, we’ve got two of everything. 
We just thought maybe you and B.K. would like to take out your own 
circus.” We were doing marionette shows around the Chicago area for 
Jimmy Cole—not Jimmy Cole. It’s [George] Cole. Oh, not Jimmy. Oh, I 
forget. Anyway, marionette shows in Chicago at school lyceum 
programs. Of all things, we did the circus. So now that we’re on that, 
I’ve got to tell the story about that, see? Keep me back, back me up in a 
minute.  
 
We had the trapeze artists, the clowns, and we had a huge elephant 
marionette. We had this [real] elephant for four years, Dixie, who’s a 
little bit on the mean side, ornery side. She didn’t mean to be. It wasn’t 
her fault because her trainer when she was little played and pushed and 
she pushed back. Well, when she got bigger it was more than playing. 
(Laughs) But anyhow, and we did the little circus skit. We’d talk and do 
things and, of course, you know I smoke and Melvin used to smoke. So 
we’d get all set up, this one day we’re somewhere up around there and 
we went out of the school, down the hall and outside to have a cigarette. 
The janitor came and he says, “Hey, your elephant got loose.” Melvin’s 
zoom! Gone, I’m right behind him. We were almost to the stage and we 
registered. (Laughs) It wasn’t our real elephant. It was the marionette. It 
was an automatic reflex. (Laughs) “Your elephant got loose.” I can 
still—my heart was beating, his was beating. (Laughs) We laughed and 
that poor janitor, I know he thought we were wacko because we flew. I 
mean it wasn’t just, it was gone. All right, I forgot about that. (Laughs)  
 
Okay, we were doing marionette shows. We went home to southern 
Indiana and Mom said we ought to take out our own show. I’m like, 
“You’ve got to be kidding me!” type thing, and I’m like… (hesitant 
noise) So we went back up to go back to work at the marionette shows 
and we talked about it. Melvin says, “Well, what would be wrong with 
that?” and talked to my mom and dad about it and Daddy says, “Well, 
usually, you’re through with the marionette shows by one or two 
o’clock.” He says, “You could go ahead and book the show the rest of

the afternoon,” which in his mind was great and would have worked 
perfectly, but, for me, it didn’t work.  
 
Well, I forgot back in ’68 is when I got thrown into booking. I’d been 
with my dad, but never in meetings. He’d tell about how he’d do it and 
what he’d talk and say to people, but I’d never really booked. So in the 
spring of ’68, Aunt Torchy says, “Well, I need you to go with me. I’m 
going to go booking”—our Clark and Walters, the family show. And, 
oh, I learned a lot from her. [Aunt Torchy said,] “Oh, wait in the car, I’ll 
be back. You make me nervous if you go in with me.” So I can’t 
remember, but anyhow it got to where we were desperate, per se. “Okay, 
B.K. You get to go booking now.” “Oh, all right.” Well, of course, I 
knew the circus. I knew how to talk to them about that and had the 
contract, and so I just took off booking and Daddy would give me tips 
and Aunt Torchy gave me tips, and I just started booking.  
 
If you recall, I said we were kind of desperate, which means maybe I 
was two weeks ahead of the show and we needed a town. So I had to 
hurry up and fill that in, per se, or sign up a town so we had a place to 
show that day. Maybe I’d be three weeks or maybe I’d be a week or a 
week and a half. Whenever B.K. got to go booking, she was right ahead 
of the show, filling them in. So back to the marionette show, we were 
talking about taking out a second circus and talking to my dad, and he 
says, “Once you finish doing the marionettes, you can go around and 
book the show and you’ll have part of the season booked and then I’ll 
take over.” So we tried that. I tried that. We went. I went booking and 
had no clue. I’m six months ahead of the show. I don’t know what to tell 
these people. “Well, we’ll have a meeting here in a couple of weeks and 
we’ll get back with you,” and I’m like, “No, no, I need to know now.” I 
couldn’t book. I had a heck of a time. I can’t push them. I don’t know 
how to close it. Like, “Yes, it’s six months away but we need to get it 
figured out now for the routing. We can’t jump from here to there to 
here.” So that didn’t work out real well. I think I got a couple of towns. 
That’s about it. My dad got the rest.  
 
So anyhow, we agreed we’d take out the circus, a second circus, because 
we had two of everything. Make sure you keep that part in mind. So it 
came time and we had two of everything. We had two elephants. Well, 
we actually had three, but we had two elephants, we had two cotton 
candy machines. What was the other thing? What was the other thing? 
Very trivial, whatever the other thing was, but there were only three that 
we had two of everything. No two tents. No extra semis or trucks. No 
extra generator. No extra this. No extra that. So we took every penny we 
made, and we bought a tent, and we bought a generator. We took out a 
loan and we bought—oh, seats. That was the third thing, but only a few 
extra seats. (Laughs) But we put Fisher Brothers Circus—oh! That was

Nykolaiszyn 
 
Silverlake 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the thing. Back up.  
 
Then it was, “Well, what are you going to call it? What are you going to 
call this circus?” I said, “Well, we’re going to call it Fisher Brothers. 
That was Grandpappy’s circus.” Remember, I told you about the 
veterinarian and they trained the dogs and that was the name, Fisher, 
because that was his last name. It was Fisher Brothers back in, probably, 
late ’20s, I think it was. Seems like, I want to say ’26. And I said, 
“That’s just, I mean, why wouldn’t we call it Fisher Brothers? What 
other name? That’s the family.” And so we called it Fisher Brothers 
Circus. We put all this junk together, and I’m telling you it was junk.  
 
My mother had a credit card, though. Way back then. I was impressed 
and thankful because when we left winter quarters for opening day, 
which was in southern Indiana—Melvin could tell you the name we 
opened in. I can’t ever remember that stuff. I had eight dollars in my 
pocket and Melvin had twelve. Mother gassed the trucks with her credit 
card, we got to the town, a circus fan from Belleview, Illinois, came 
over. Melvin still had to go on down into Kentucky and pick up our 
elephant that we got to use, which was Dixie, the one that was really 
nice—not! We got her, of course. Jimmy came, somehow he came—or 
maybe it was the next day or two and fine tuned our generator, because 
that’s what he did in the navy. Then, of course, he had to go back to 
Clark and Walters. 
 
The circus fan used to come and sell banners. Now, I’ve got to explain 
that part. Okay. Banners are, you go to a store and you sell, it’s an 
advertisement. We paint them very quickly, shoe polish, whatever’s 
handy, magic marker, the name of the store and we hang it up, and we 
make an announcement about it with a captive audience, and they pay 
him to do that for advertising. But instead of him getting paid on 
opening day, he got light bulbs for the big tents, the big top, so that they 
[the public] could see us perform. He got a chain for the elephant so that 
we could tie her up because we didn’t have one. (Laughs) I don’t 
remember what all he got, but stuff like that. 
 
He did a lot of trading. 
 
Yes. He did a lot of trading that day, and I was just getting ready to have 
the boys bring my car around. We’d had the tent ready to go up. It was 
getting later and later and I was getting more nervous because Melvin 
hadn’t gotten back with Dixie yet to pull the tent up. I said, “Bring the 
car around. We’re going to have to pull it up with the car.” I don’t even 
know if he got to the car, Melvin pulled in. Oh, I was so happy! I can 
remember I was so happy because he was there, I wasn’t by myself. 
Everybody we had was great people, but I felt like I was [by myself]

without him being there.  
 
Then we had a sideshow. Oh, God, I don’t remember what we had in 
there. We must have had that—I can’t believe we had the five legged 
cow then. Maybe we did. What else did we have? Oh, that was one thing 
Mom had we had two of. We had an extra llama. Of course, Dixie would 
be in the sideshow. I can’t remember what all animals. Maybe we had a 
monkey or two extra that we got. But anyhow, here comes Wesley. 
Now, its opening time for the first show, crowd of people, the midway is 
just full of people. Here comes Wesley with the animals for the 
sideshow because the sideshow was on this side, the animals were tied 
out over here. (Gestures) So he walks them through the crowd, “Excuse 
me. Excuse me, I need to get through here,” and takes the animals in the 
sideshow. Melvin gets up and does the bally [ballyhoo] to open the 
sideshow. I think we charged a quarter to go in and see the sideshow. 
Almost everybody paid to go in and see these animals that Wesley had 
just walked through. (Laughs) It was awful! It was awful! But we had 
packed—both houses were full. We didn’t have a lot of help. Mike 
Gasca was with us. That’s another whole story.  
 
We made the office and candy wagon out of an old, ugly trailer, old, old, 
old, old. Even for then, it was an old trailer. We built it ourselves, him 
[Mike Gasca] and I. Nobody was interested in that part of the show, and 
so Mike helped me. But we’d go into town, which is Brownstown, 
Indiana, and I’d say, “I need one of those things that kind of crooks 
around and then it folds under and it’s got a clamp on it,” to the 
hardware store, or the lumberyard, because I didn’t know nothing about 
building anything or what anything was called. It was comical because I 
think they had, maybe, three or four guys working there and I’d walk in 
that front door, and I’m telling you, they made a beeline for that back, 
and whoever was last had to wait on me. (Laughter) They hated it 
because I didn’t know the names of none of the stuff. “Well, you know, 
it kind of crooks around this way,” or “You know, it’s about that long, or 
maybe it’s that long, about that big.” They were just like, “Oh, my 
gosh!” Finally, they said, “Lady, just go back there and find it. Whatever 
you want, just go get it.” (Laughs) 
 
But anyway, we built this. The office had an outside door at the front of 
the trailer. And really it wasn’t much of an office. It was more like a 
ticket window to sell the tickets out of. Then there was a door that went 
from the inside there back to the concessions. There was a cotton candy 
machine, counter, snow cone machine, and then popcorn across the 
back. Now, I’m here to tell you, because I was pretty young back then, I 
would sell a ticket, catch a floss off the machine, I could wait on 
somebody, or I could grind ice, or I could make a snow cone, go back, 
sell the next ticket, and catch the next floss that came off that machine.

We didn’t have a lot of help the first few days. I guess I did that a couple 
of weeks, then Diane Wilson showed up and she took over the 
concessions for me.  
 
I cooked and I did three or four acts in the show. Oh, I had Joe’s dog act. 
I did my goat act, the dog act, swinging ladder, trapeze and the elephant. 
I did five acts in the show and checked with the sponsor, cooked. My 
mother helped me. One of us would try and get dishes. We’d hit and 
miss. Which, it was something, but we had nothing to start with. About 
five days later, we were over by Terre Haute, Indiana, and they have a 
concession supply place there. I was so proud because I had money, I 
went and bought a popcorn machine. We didn’t have one, but that’s 
where it was, I mean, the back, we set it there. We didn’t have a snow 
cone, either, so I must have just done the floss and Coca-Cola. That must 
have been what it was, yes. 
 
The floss is…? 
 
The cotton candy. Yes, where you take it and fix it. Then I’d sell a 
ticket, take it, and I’d either fix ice in a cup—that’s what it was, because 
we didn’t have a snow cone or the popcorn because I bought the popcorn 
just four or five days later. I can’t remember when we—maybe I called 
and ordered a snow cone. I can’t even remember now.  
 
Did you ever sleep? 
 
Not much. (Laughter) I told you, I was younger. Then, the first pay day, 
I think we had like fifteen hundred dollars left over after paying 
everything, and paying all the help and everything, and Mother and I 
were just nervous wrecks. (Gasp) We had all that money. “Goodness, 
what are we going to do? We’d better get it sent home. Oh, my God! Oh, 
my God! We just panicked. Before the season was over that year, 
because that was 1971, we opened Fisher Brothers Circus, we had one 
day that we did not have packed, jammed crowds. So before the season 
was over, if I didn’t have a thousand dollars in my purse, I was broke. 
But, to start, I was scared to death. 
 
What size lots were you looking for? 
 
About two hundred by three hundred feet. It was a small one ring tent. 
You haven’t seen Kelly Miller Circus. It was about the size of it. It 
didn’t look as pretty. I mean, trust me. We built it to where it did look 
pretty, but to open, we’ve got pictures. I’ll show you someday. It was 
horrible. Our tent was a square tent, not round, because that’s the only 
one we could afford and buy.

But I bet the crowd didn’t know the difference. 
 
No. That year—and I am not exaggerating—not even an ounce or less. 
We would pull on the lot and there were people standing where we 
needed to set up and I’d say to myself, ‘Please, go home people. Please 
go home.’ [I would say, “Please move back we need to put up the tent.”] 
When I would go in to do trapeze, let’s say, Melvin would announce me, 
they would open the back door—and it wasn’t just me, whoever—but 
it’s, “Excuse me, I need to get in here. If you’d like to see this act, please 
excuse me, I need to get through,” day after day after day. And the 
people loved us, just loved us. Then, in ’71, Ted Wilson kept begging us 
to come—that was ’71. Well, it was that winter, I guess. We opened in 
’72, down in Texas. He begged us to come down to the Rio Grande 
Valley of Texas, because we could open earlier and close later. In 
Indiana, the weather wouldn’t let you.  
 
So, oh, Melvin hum hummed around, and hum hummed. I’m a decision 
maker. It drove me crazy. Melvin says, “Well, what if, oh…” and I say, 
“We’re going. If we lose everything we’ve got, we’ll just start over, do 
something else. You’ve got to try or you aren’t going to get anything.” 
That’s my theory, but anyway, we went. We had friends down there and 
we stayed on their property the first year, and then same thing, even 
down in there [we had big crowds]. My dad was exceptional. When he 
booked for Clark and Walters, they had packed houses. He just knew 
where to be, when to be there. He did something magical with the 
sponsors, the people he talked to. Now that I’m on my father, we’ll go 
back to Bill Griffith.  
 
Bill Griffith told me one time, because my father was round belly, and 
wore suspenders and not a slob at all, but he wasn’t savvy. He wasn’t 
chic or cool. He was just little, old—there he was, Raymond Duke. Bill 
did a survey one time, he told me, just a few years ago. He said, “You 
know, I couldn’t figure out what your dad would do to these people.” 
Because here’s Bill Griffith, dressed to the nines, suits, and that’s the 
way you would think that you should go in and present yourself to these 
people [sponsors]. Daddy would wear a sports jacket, maybe, if it’s the 
first time he’s seeing them, but nothing way elaborate. Bill said, “I 
couldn’t believe it,” and he says, “I asked them, ‘Why would you sign to 
have this circus? What did Mr. Duke tell you that made you decide? 
Why did you want to do this? Why did you sign that contract?’” He said 
it was like for three or four weeks, he asked every day. He said every 
one of them said, “We just believed him.” “We just believed him.” And 
he did tell the truth.  
 
I was bad about that when I started booking. I undersold us, and a lot of 
the times the sponsors, once in a while I’d be back to a town where I’d

booked, and they’d say, “Well, you didn’t tell us you had all this stuff.” I 
said, “Well, it’s a circus.” (Laughs) So I really would undersell it more 
than oversell it. To me, afterwards, I thought, “Well that’s pretty cool, 
because they’re getting more than what you told them they were getting, 
so they’re more pleased.” But I’ve been known to have sponsors want to 
keep me. I had one sponsor up in Indiana, I was sick, oh, horrible with 
pneumonia. Him and his wife, they weren’t going to let me leave. I said, 
“I’ve got to go. I’ve got to be at the other side of the state in the 
morning.” They said, “You’re going to stay right here with us.”  
 
We had sponsors in Texas. In the wintertime, they would call, “B.K.? 
There’s a wrestling show that wants to come in here, and they’d like for 
us to sponsor them. Would that be all right with you? You’ll still bring 
your circus, won’t you?” That’s proud. That’s pride for them to—and 
not just one, several would do that. I booked, one year, coming out of 
Texas—because we would come out of Texas, work our way up to 
Michigan, and work our way back to the valley of Texas. One year I, oh, 
God, it’s kind of northeast Texas. Oh, shoot! Not Marshall. It wasn’t 
Marshall, but over in that area. Anyway, I booked it and the sheriff’s 
department was our sponsor. We had a nice show, had a big crowd, 
everything is great and fine and lovely, right? And we go on.  
 
Well, we had hired a fellow to help my dad book, [that fall he booked 
the same town]. So coming back that fall—and I didn’t catch it right at 
first—but as I kind of thought about the name of the town, I’m thinking, 
“I booked that. I’m sure I booked that this spring.” So I got looking to 
make sure, because I thought, “Surely…” and for the sheriff’s 
department! (Laughs) I’m like, “Uh, you do realize we showed there,” 
talking to the same guy I talked to. He says, “Yes, but we liked it so 
much, we wanted you back. And so when the guy came in, ‘Shoot, yeah! 
Come on.’” (Laughs) But he [the agent] didn’t know that we had showed 
it in the spring. So we showed it in the spring, and we showed it in the 
fall. We had two good crowds both times, but that I was proud of. 
 
Would you ever run into other circuses as you were passing through? 
Did they ever get close to you? 
 
Oh, they do, but not very often. Even today they will, but not often.  
 
So it wasn’t even an issue for you. 
 
No. Oh, the old timers would get all upset. “We ought to go in and tear 
their paper down!” And they would, too. Or, “We got to get them 
tickets, free tickets or something, for our show!” “We’ve got to do 
something! We’ve got to get in there before they do!” They’d tear down 
the posters and put theirs up. I mean, it’s one day, guys. Give it a break!

I mean, it isn’t going to make or break you over a whole season. They 
panicked and oh, my Lord! You don’t steal somebody else’s help off of 
another show. You’re working for Clark and Walters and you’re 
working for Fisher Brothers, but you’d rather be working for Fisher 
Brothers, but I can’t hire you—and not because we’re family. I should 
have used a better example, like Carson and Barnes and Culpepper and 
Merriweather or something. You don’t hire other people. It’s even bad 
when, say, you quit Carson and Barnes. “I’ve had it. I don’t want to go.” 
And just maybe a week, two weeks, a month down the way, you happen 
to talk to Culpepper and he needs somebody for a job, so he hires you. 
You’re still in trouble because you left there. He stole you. Culpepper 
stole you from—well, they didn’t, I mean, most of the time. Very few, 
I’m sure, very, very few did anybody con somebody into leaving one 
show for another. It just would happen that way.  
 
Oh, yes. They used to get paranoid over it and I’m like, “You guys are 
nuts,” but they did. I mean they used to. They truly did. They’d worry 
about route—and you don’t want to be in the same route, really, as 
another show. I mean, you need to be kind of on your own and they need 
to be. My theory always was, “Why don’t we all get together and you 
take this route, you take this one, and I’ll take what’s left? It doesn’t 
matter. Next year, we can switch so that the public is seeing a 
different…,” oh, no. That never flew. (Laughs) We still compete for 
towns.  
 
Right down here, Ringling Brothers Circus, my nephew is the marketing 
director. He’s got something more than that for a title. He’s one of the 
big wigs of the whole district. He does Tulsa, he does Oklahoma City, 
and he does Dallas. He’s in charge of all of them, New Orleans, this 
whole area out here. He’s worried because Cirque du Soleil is going to 
be there in Dallas. It means nothing. People are going to Ringling 
Brothers, or whatever. And he told me, “Aunt B.K., you better not be 
booking Carson and Barnes around here.” “Yeah, okay Bradley, right.” I 
booked it anyway. (Laughter) Who is this? I mean, around here, yes, 
Carson and Barnes, they do kind of know the name. But Ringling, it’s 
Ringling. Any other circus, majority, it’s a circus. Well, what was the 
name of the circus that was here last week? Uh, I don’t know. It’s a 
circus. The name… 
 
They just know that they had a good time.  
 
Yes. The name, usually, it’s not a household thing. Ringling is a 
household name. On the east coast, Clyde Beatty was a household name, 
on the west coast, Circus Vargas. Other than that—Carson and Barnes 
and Kelly Miller are kind of Midwest—other than that, they don’t know. 
“It was a circus.” They don’t know the name of it. They couldn’t tell

you, the average person that is. 
 
What were some of your bigger challenges as you’ve established and 
you’re going along? 
 
With the Fisher Brothers Circus? 
 
Owning, yes, Fisher Brothers. 
 
We didn’t have any. I had my dad. (Laughs) That’s all. I don’t know. I 
have no way to explain it to you. The people that used to know him, a lot 
of them are gone, but they all would tell you. He had something, him 
and Gene Christian. I always give Gene credit because Gene was just as 
good. They were good friends and they’d write back and forth who was 
the best booking agent. But they were good friends. He just had a knack. 
He studied it. He studied where to be, when to be there. He ate, slept, 
and breathed circus. It was everything to him.  
 
And how long did you all have Fisher Brothers? 
 
Well, we sold it, actually, in 1976. Actually, in ’75. My mother, in ’75—
well, this may as well be told, too. Fall of the year, my mother took Mel 
Ray [B.K.’s son] home to the Rio Grande Valley of Texas for school. 
My mother-in-law, Josephine, Joe, the youngest boy, and his friend Don 
[also went]. Dad was there too, Brownie. They all took J.R., Myrna’s 
daughter [Myrna was Melvin’s sister], to the Rio Grande Valley home 
for school. Then my mother would stay and Mel Ray and J.R., Myrna’s 
daughter, would go to school. In the spring of ’75, our cook left not long 
after we opened. I don’t even remember who it was. So I put in ads in 
the newspaper around Houston, Texas, where we were showing. I kept 
calling and putting in ads for a cook, and this fellow came out and I 
hired him. He was actually a gourmet cook. I said, “Why would you 
want to go to the circus?” [He said] “I just want to travel.” So I hired 
him. 
 
At that time, my mother was home with the kids for school. That’s kind 
of the way it is. When school’s on, unless they’re homeschooled, 
somebody, family, is staying with the kids. So I hired him and he stayed 
and he did a great job. We ate terrific. (Laughs) He had a problem. He 
was going through a divorce, and so that was why, I think, part of it was 
why he joined. Anyway, something came up and he had two girls, two 
young girls. He said he needed to go and take care of that. I said, “That’s 
fine. That’s okay.” So he left. Then Mother brought Mel Ray and J.R. on 
the road, on the show, and spent the summer and it came time for school 
to start, and then that’s when Mother took Mel Ray home, and Josephine 
and them took J.R. home. They were going to come back to the show,

[Josephine (mom), Brownie (dad) and Joe].  
 
We didn’t have cell phones, of course. So every Sunday I would call 
Mother whenever she was home, just checking in-type thing. Well, this 
Saturday, McDonald’s, the chain restaurant had come and they were 
wanting to buy Fisher Brothers. Well, we talked to them. They liked us. 
I’m telling you, Fisher Brothers was a liked show. Anyhow, we met 
[with the heads of McDonalds on a Saturday], went down to the 
restaurant, and we were talking business. We had a big jump the next 
day, and it was a Sunday and an early show, so I told Melvin, “I’m 
going to call Mother before we go back to the lot because in case I don’t 
get to tomorrow.” And so I called and she said, “Dennis is here,” who is 
the cook that I hired in the spring. And I said, “Oh?” She said, “Yes. 
He’s been here almost a week. He’s been helping me around here, 
cleaning up the yard, and doing different stuff.” Oh, he went over and 
helped Mom and them at their place, trying to get it, whatever they 
needed because they’ve been gone for a while, whatever. I don’t know, 
because we had a yard man, Julio. There’s another story.  
 
So she said, “Do you want me to send him [Dennis] back to the show or 
do you want him just to stay here?” because it was the fall of the year, 
and so I asked Melvin, I said, “Do you want him to come?” “Yes, we 
need another driver. Tell her to get him on a plane in the morning.” I 
said, “Mother, do you have enough money to get him on a plane in the 
morning and fly him out here and we’ll pick him up?” She said, “Yes, 
but you’ll have to send me some more money, because I’m going to 
have to get another window unit, air conditioner, because it’s hot this 
year down here.” I said, “All right, I’ll do that Monday morning.” Well, 
that night, Joe and his friend, Don, and Dennis and J.R., all went to 
another friend’s in the Valley that Joe knew—well, we all knew him, but 
they were friends—and they went and they partied and watched TV and 
movies or whatever. J.R. was fifteen, but Joe was her uncle. So they all 
went and they came back. 
 
Our place there had a circle driveway and off to the side of the circle we 
had made trailer places. So they were parked there, and Mother and J.R. 
and Mel Ray were in sleeping in the house and my aunt was there, too. It 
was a pretty good sized house. J.R. went on up to the house, and Dennis 
was sleeping in our bunkhouse and so he went to go back there, and Joe 
and Don went on into Joe’s trailer to go to bed. Joe said about the time 
he got his clothes off and just laid down, they heard a shot, a scream, 
and another shot. Of course, my mother-in-law, Josephine, was next 
door and she heard it, and so she was trying to get her shoes on. She 
heard these footsteps running down the gravel driveway and she thought 
it was J.R. because she knew it was her granddaughter screaming. We 
were thankful she didn’t get out there, because it wasn’t.

Anyway, Joe and Don got their shoes on and ran up to the house and Joe 
said, “Don, go get Dennis. We may need him.” They’re trying to look in 
to see in the house. Well, Dennis wasn’t there. Dennis had broken into 
the back of the house and shot my mother and J.R., and killed both of 
them. Then he ran down the—we only know this later—and then stole 
the neighbor’s truck and then left it stranded. They found him the next 
day walking down the street in Donna, Texas, still had the gun in his 
pocket. So we were pretty disheartened. Everybody loved my mother. 
I’m not saying my dad was a great agent because he was my dad. He just 
was. If he was lousy, I’d tell you he was lousy. My mother, though, 
everybody loved her. She was an amazing person. Ralph [Gifford] said 
the other day, he was talking about her and he says, “I don’t believe I 
ever heard anybody even say a cross word about your mother. 
Everybody loved her.” And they did. But anyway, we got disheartened 
and we sold the show that fall, wintery, like, November-ish, December. 
The next June, I was driving to the next lot one morning and I went, 
“(Gasp) We sold our circus!” We just were at a loss. It just threw us.  
 
We sold the circus and we sold it to friends, Johnny Frazier and his 
brother, Corky. They told us we should go right along with them and we 
did, and that didn’t work out. (Laughs) Well, Johnny left and took his 
circus to Canada, which he had done every year and Corky stayed. 
Melvin and Corky didn’t get along and, well, I don’t think anybody gets 
along too well with Corky, but anyway, we did that, so we left. The only 
one that actually stayed the whole season was Mike Gasca. My dad 
finally left. He was not doing real well with his heart and his pacemaker. 
I can’t remember where Daddy went.  
 
Anyway, we went home to Indiana, my home, northern Indiana. We 
stayed for a while and a fellow by the name of Bob Tripp got a hold of 
us. He wanted us to go and manage Mid America Circus, and so we did 
that. We didn’t know the people or anything, but we needed a job. We 
got there. I was to run the office and Melvin was to run the show. This is 
all over the phone. Bob said, “My son-in-law will be there with the 
office to meet you,” in whatever town it was we were meeting them in. 
See, I can’t remember. Melvin could tell you the town, what day, all that 
good stuff, but I can’t. Anyway, his son-in-law was there and he handed 
me this little case. He said, “Here’s the office.” (Laughs) And Bob says, 
“And I’ll see you in a week or two.” I mean, he hadn’t seen us, we didn’t 
know each other, but we ran the show. 
 
Where was that based? Mid America. 
 
Tulsa, Oklahoma.

Finchum 
 
Silverlake 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Oh, okay. 
 
Bob Tripp was the man’s name, a superior phone promotion guy. He 
knew how to do the phone sales, the promotion, and had people on the 
seats. Oh, my Lord! But we were with them for that year. We did winter 
shows with them. He taught me. I’d done phone sales, but he really 
taught me, him and his wife, more how to do them and things that I 
didn’t know. I don’t think he showed up for about two weeks [when we 
were managing Mid America], and just a couple or three days before he 
showed up, I was real nervous because I was short four hundred dollars, 
and I recounted. I went through a whole inkpad of calculating ink papers 
and checked and was a mess and could not balance. So he came, and I 
went and told him. And he says, “Oh, it’ll turn up.” I’m like, “Oh, thank 
you!” So he says, “Now, tomorrow night,” he says, “We’re all going to 
go out to dinner.” “All right.” And I’m thinking, “Are these people all 
right?” He doesn’t know us, never seen us, hires us, turns over 
everything, and here he shows up and I tell him I’m short money. “Oh, 
that’s okay. It’ll show up.”  
 
So the next night we go out to eat. I dug under the bed or wherever, 
bringing out this new pair of shoes or a nicer pair of shoes to go out and 
eat. Well, I’d stuck the money in there. I had a habit of, with our show, 
anybody’s—and I’ve always told my son and everybody, “When I die, 
make sure you check all my pockets. Make sure you check the freezer, 
make sure you check…,” and here was that money. I thought, “Oh my 
God, I forgot I put it there!” So I took it to him. (Laughs) But I had 
panicked. He was just a fantastic guy, and we were around him for 
maybe the next two or three years. Let’s see, what did we do after that? 
Oh, I guess, maybe that’s when Jimmy and Marlyn—what the heck were 
they doing? Maybe he’d been on Great American Circus, which is out of 
Florida. We all got together and put together a little indoor circus and 
did that for a while. 
 
And what was it called? 
 
What did we call that? C and W Variety Show, I believe. Clark and 
Walters, but we cut it short to C and W Variety Show. I believe that was 
it. Let’s see, what did we do after that? (Laughs) Jimmy went to Hoxie 
Brothers. Oh, I think that’s about the time we got mixed up with Gopher. 
We were on his show for a while. Don’t ask me which title he had, 
because it changed often. It still does. Then I don’t know. Next thing I 
kind of remember was we were sitting in southern Indiana at Melvin’s 
home and he [called about us doing] pig races. The gal called and hired 
us. [We had been] out in the yard just sitting and talking. He came back 
out off the phone and I said, “Well”—where are we headed? Some 
ungodly place, miles and miles and miles away. I said, “We can’t do

that! We can’t make that!” “Yes, we can. I told her we’d do it.” (Laughs) 
And we did. We did pig races for three or four years, I guess. 
Robinson’s Racing Pigs. No, it had to be Peoria, so it wasn’t that far, 
maybe. It was something with the jumps, though. Oh, yes it was. Yes, I 
recall well all of a sudden.  
 
We opened in Peoria, Illinois, and we had just little bleachers. We’d 
have maybe two or three hundred people for a show. They were actually 
like horse races. The pigs run around a track for an Oreo cookie. But 
what made ours good was Melvin’s spiel, his lingo, his talk about 
Hammy Fay Bacon was one of them and Pig-Wee Herman and Hulk 
Hog-an. I still can’t even say that right. I can’t say—Hulk Hog-an. 
(Laughs) Then he’d just throw in all kinds of lingo and the people just 
loved it. Well, anyway, from Peoria we went to the Wisconsin State 
Fair, where they had us on a whole half a block. I counted, the front 
seats were twenty-five high, or twenty-something, I figured. Anyway, 
twenty-five hundred people could fill the front seats and the ones on the 
end. I figure there was probably about fifteen hundred.  
 
Well, we’re laughing because we just came from Peoria and we might 
have had two or three hundred people per race. I said, “Man, these 
people think we’re going to do something.” (Laughs) And we’re 
laughing. Miller Beer, and Saz’s Barbeque, and a radio station were our 
sponsors there. We had to put on Miller special blankets I had to make 
for the pigs for the Miller beer. We had Miller pennants and all kinds of 
Miller advertising. So the next day or two, whenever it was, opening 
day, we’re sitting in the trailer because it’s hot, it’s August. I’m doing 
something and I look out and it’s about two hours before the first race. I 
look out the window, “Melvin, there are people sitting out there. “Oh,” 
he says, “They’re just resting. They’re tired. There are seats, they’re just 
resting.” Pretty soon, I said, “Melvin, there are more people sitting out 
there.” “Melvin, there are more people sitting out there!” By the time it 
was race time, both sets of bleachers were full. There were people on top 
of our house trailer, on top of our pickup, on top of the pig trailer, on top 
of the pig pickup or van we had, everywhere—packed!  
 
Now, these pig races last about (snaps) and they’re over because they 
move. We did two races. We had two sets of pigs so we’d always do two 
races. I’m like, “Melvin, we can’t, they’re just two…” In ten minutes, 
the whole thing’s over, fifteen [minutes], tops. You’ve got to really 
stretch it to make even fifteen. I said, “These people have been sitting 
there for two hours.” I said, “We’ve got to run another set of pigs.” “Oh, 
no, no, Carlotta, I don’t have a…” I said, “I don’t care! She isn’t here!” 
(Laughs) So we ran the first set again. We’d do three sets every time. 
They loved it, just loved it! The famous thing about the Wisconsin State 
Fair is their cream puffs are the most popular item. Not those years. The

pig races were the most popular items. Miller Beer was almost 
embarrassed to sponsor the pig races until—we must have opened like a 
Thursday—until the Sunday paper came out. Every big wig at Miller 
Beer was at that race, because we didn’t make the front page of the 
Sports issue, we made the front page of the Milwaukee Sentinel in color. 
[That changed their minds.] They were like, “Whoa! These are our 
pigs!” (Laughs) Then they got so a lot of them would come out and 
they’d want to bet on them. “Which one’s going to win, B.K.?” “I don’t 
know which one!” “Well, which one do you think is going to win this 
time?” “Well, all right.” I’d hate to say. Half the time, it would lose. 
(Laughs)  
 
It was a blast, it really was, and they loved it. They loved it. Finally, we 
got enough security that they didn’t get on our personal equipment. They 
contained them just to the seats, but every race. And we did three races 
every time and stalled in between. The one race I remember—because 
Melvin was macho and a stout man. Down in the small section, we had a 
lot of bikers, and you knew they were bikers. They liked their Harleys, 
and they liked their hogs. What we also did, he would pick cheerleaders 
for four pigs, four cheerleaders out of the audience, and so whichever 
pig won, they got a blue ribbon, the cheerleader did, if they picked the 
right pig. So Melvin, he would avoid these bikers. I said, “Melvin, 
you’ve got to pick one of them, because they’re wanting to be a 
cheerleader so bad.” And I said, “You’ve got to pick one of them! “If 
they lose, they’ll come kill me.” He’s like panicked. He isn’t going—I 
said, “Melvin, you can make jokes. They like their hogs. They ought to 
know the hog,” and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  
 
So the third race, he picked one of the girls. He figured he was safer or 
something, I don’t know. (Laughs) Thank you, Lord. She won. (Laughs) 
He was so happy! But he was this macho man, but he wasn’t going to 
pick one of them. So that was the pig race story, and we went on. Oh, 
about the—I said, “We can’t do that.” From there, which was 
Milwaukee, Wisconsin, we jumped to Cape Cod, Nantucket, and we had 
two days. We never stopped, never slept, never stopped. Just, well, and 
Myrna was there. No, maybe that was the second year, because Myrna 
was there and we just kept switching drivers. 
 
What did you like more? Did you like that type of circuit or would you 
rather be with the circus? 
 
Well, I liked the pig races. We had lots of fun. They were boring 
because the most you’d do is six races a day at different times. Most of 
the times were four or five [races] and like I said, they’d last ten or 
fifteen minutes, so there you are. You can’t go do anything because in 
two hours, you’ve got to be there. Well, if there’s a big crowd, you may

not get back. But I love the circus. My son came this year, went to work 
for Culpepper and Merriweather. He does whips, cracking the old, bull 
whips. His dad and I used to do them. One of the girls on the show holds 
the papers, the targets for him now, but I told him, “I’m going to hold 
them on opening day, Mel Ray, and we’ll do the old act. We’ll do the 
routine, because they just do a straight act.”  
 
Anyway, their help didn’t get in for opening and so I went over, we all 
went over, whoever, and I carried stakes. I carried side poles. Of course, 
that’s about it for me anymore. I wanted to drive a stake so bad, and I 
said, “I’m going to drive one because I may never be able to.” (Laughs) 
I couldn’t even lift the sledgehammer. I said, “Haven’t you got a smaller 
one?” (Laughs) But I didn’t. But I got to do that, and I helped where I 
could and I said, “Mel Ray, they’re going to die when they see the whip 
act.” Simone is the owner’s fiancé now, she holds the papers, usually, 
for him, or the targets, and I said, “They’re going to die when they see 
our act.” Simone said, “Well, B.K., how do I announce you?” And I 
said, “Well, you just say ‘Mel Silverlake and Family’ or whatever. It 
doesn’t matter. Don’t worry about me. I’m just the second guy here.”  
 
Well, I couldn’t remember the routine at the first show that good, but we 
stumbled through it. I’d glance over at Simone and she’d just be 
cracking up, because we do more of a comedy-type act. She would just 
be cracking up, and Ralph and Susie [Gifford] and some of the other 
folks. Afterward, Ralph said, “I didn’t know you could do that kind of 
stuff.” I’m like, “Ralph, I’ve been in this business all my life!” (Laughs) 
Until they see you do it, they don’t figure. But anyway, I enjoyed that. 
That was like just a breath of fresh air, because I hadn’t done anything 
for so long or been right on the circus. 
 
And with your son. 
 
Yes, that makes it better. (Laughs) He’s a pretty good kid. Lots of 
people like him, too. He’s been on a carnival the last three years or four, 
maybe, and they just beg, beg, beg, beg for him to come, but they don’t 
want to up his pay or give him a little extra something here or there, but 
boy they want him. He works. He works hard.  
 
Well, I think we’re going to stop at this point because it keeps getting 
darker. 
 
That’s fine.  
 
Next time we see you, we’ll pick back up after pig racing.
