Don't You Grieve
DON'T YOU GRIEVE 4137 52 A2
Troy Cambron Arvin, 1940
I went down town a-feelin' mighty funny Picked up a pocket book stuffed full of money Man
on the street said, “Where ya goin' sonny?” An' I tol' him not to grieve about me.
While I'm gone it's don' you grieve While I'm gone it's don' you grieve While I'm gone it's
don' you grieve O don't you grieve about me.
Went to a hotel to stay all night Gave six bits and they said alright Went upstairs and went
to bed An' I told 'era not to grieve about me.
While I'm gone it's don' you grieve While I'm gone it's don' you grieve While I'm gone it's
don' you grieve O don't you grieve about me.
Got up nex mornin and dressed my feet, Went down stairs to my breakfast seat, Jumped
on the table and started in to eat, And I told 'em not to grieve about me.
While I'm gone it's don' you grieve While I'm gone it's don' you grieve While I'm gone it's
don' you grieve O don't you grieve about me.
Got on a train without a cent of money Long come conductor lookin might funny Tapped
me on the head said, “Where ya goin' sonny?” An' I told him not to grieve about me.
At the next station he put me off He ought not to done it fer I had a bad cough All in a
squall the train rode off An' I told him not to grieve about me.
