CT: Here we go. Today is April 1st, 2022. This is an interview for the custodians and janitors 
in Colorado, Oral History Project funded by an Archie Green Fellowship from the Library of 
Congress. As a part of the project, we're interviewing people employed in the janitorial and 
custodial fields to record their stories, document their skills and knowledge and better 
understand their important role in our communities. 
The recording and transcript will become a permanent part of the collection at the Library of 
Congress. My name is Cynthia Torres, I am joined by our interpreter, Rosabel Rice and 
collaborator Jaime Medina. Today I am speaking with-- Can you tell? 
AS: Aurelia Sáenz. 
CT: Sáenz, okay. We are recording in Colorado, the time is approximately 6:45. For the 
record, do you give us permission to record your story? 
CT: You give us your-- 
AS: Yes. 
CT: Great. Can you tell us the year you were born? 
AS: ‘59. 
CT: Your current job title. 
AS: Janitor. 
CT: Janitor, okay. Jaime, you're going to be asking the questions this evening? 
Jaime Medina: How long have you been working as a custodian? 
AS: 15 years. 
CT: All here in the same place? 
AS: No. 
AS: I was on the first shift for 11 years. 
AS: I've been working here for three years. 
AS: Or maybe four. 
JM: Tell me a little bit about your early life and family. 
JM: Where were you born and how did you end up in Colorado? 
AS: I was born in Chihuahua, Mexico. 
AS: I got here in 1972. 
Transcription: Aurelia Saenz (English)

AS: I got my Green Card in 85. 
AS: 85 or 86. 
AS: I began to work- 
AS: Ever since I got here in 72, I've been working. 
AS: Actually, in 72 I went to school. 
AS: For about three years. 
AS: Until I turned 16. 
AS: I had no one to give me any money because I wasn't raised with my mother or my 
father. 
AS: I came up here with a brother of mine and with a sister-in-law. 
5:02 
AS: But they wouldn't give me anything. I didn't want to be a bother to them so I began 
working. I worked at a turkey plant. I started working there. I worked there for a few years. 
There I started working at IBM. Working and working. I got married. I had four kids. I began 
working so my kids could have a better life. My life has just been working and just having to 
battle with my sons and daughters. Then I came over here to the university. In 97. I was 
earning a salary of $1,200 a month. I paid my rent from there. My electricity. My gas. Make 
the car payment. Give money to my kids for their school. I never really had a whole lot left 
over. But since I liked working, I'd find houses that I could clean. That's been my life. I've 
never gone on vacation anywhere. I came from México in 72 and never returned back. I've 
gone twice but just really quick, there back. I don't even know the money that they have. I 
never really liked studying. I don't like the computer. I don't know anything. I know how to 
read in English. But I don't know how to write it. It was really hard for me to educate my kids 
and be able to help them all with their homework. My kids grew up, got married and left. 
I'm all alone. I'm going to keep working until I retire from here. 
CT: Do you have a retirement date? 
AS: In four years, I will be coming over 20 years. I want to just finish those 20 years and 
that's it. 
JM: How did you come to be a custodian? 
AS: I worked in a lot of assembly factories. Wires and everything, putting all that together. 
Then my nerves started getting really tight. They just started really bugging me. Then I said, 
"I'm better off going to do a cleaning job". In 2003, it was? Yes. I worked at the Rec Center, 
here at the university. At the time, my daughters were small. I didn't want anyone else to be 
taking care of my kids. I had to quit. I was out of the workforce for about three years. Then 
afterwards, through a friend of mine. Who worked here as a lead. She helped me to get 
back on again. Because I was working at a factory in Gun Barrel. For three years. I didn't

want to be there because the factory - was so small, I couldn't really find anything that I 
could even clean anymore. I was just getting so bored. My supervisor really didn't want me 
to leave either. I told him, "I'm sorry," but I was bored. I've always believed in God a lot. 
The supervisor said to me, "So where are you going to then?" I said, "I'm going to the 
university." But I never thought I'd be able to get back on at the university. I always tell the 
story kind of like a testimony. Because God does make miracles. I just told my supervisor I 
was going to come over here. What ended up happening, I came over here. I worked for-- 
What do you call this? Temp service. 
The people here, they didn't really like it. I mean, people that are here, whether somebody 
new comes in or whether there's a temp service, they really are not very happy with it and 
they'll tend to really take it out on you. 
I just told them was, "Hey, all I want to do is just finish up my six months." Because at the 
time I really didn't want to stay. 
There was a manager that was there. By the name of Tara. I don't remember her last name. 
She called me in to her office. She said to me that I was permanent. I said, "How was that? I 
didn't sign any papers." She said, I don't know how you say it in Spanish, but I have been 
reinstated. I say, "Well thank you." 
When a new person comes. Like right now there's a young guy that's working together with 
me. I do not bother him in the least. I leave him alone. Because if they don't do their jobs, 
that's not my problem. That's why we have supervisors and leads. I really take young people 
into consideration. Because I have children. There's a lot of people who aren't really patient 
with them, but not me. I've worked here with little white kids. They haven't done bad things 
- but I see - I never - I never go to the supervisor or the lead to rat them up. No, I don't go to 
them with any stories. I just focus on my work. 
15:59 
CT: Nice 
AS: I don't really speak. Because sometimes they want to see what you are trying to say. You 
want to get along with people, but sometimes that's not possible. I like to work by myself. In 
prior years, we worked using teamwork. One person would take the garbage out. Another 
person would vacuum. Another person would map. The people who are coming in now, 
they don't want to. I'm really very aware and conscious of Americans because I feel like we 
are here in their country. We're not going to come from other countries and take it out on 
them. If they sometimes have mental issues, we are here to help them out. Not to criticize 
them. I don't think I'm perfect. I try to do the best I can. I have a lot of experience in 
cleaning. I like cleaning and cleaning and cleaning. I like doing that. 
18:14 
JM: Tell me a story of one of your most challenging or memorable days working as a 
custodian. 
Transcription: Aurelia Saenz (English) 
4 
AS: The worst case. When you can't find a way to defend yourself against supervisors when 
they're looking at you. Because I know who I am. I know that I'm doing my work. I know that 
I'm here on time for work. I've had issues, not here though. But on the day, sure. I don't 
fight. But I do defend my rights. We're human beings, we can't just hang our heads. I mean 
yes, there are supervisors. I had a problem with the day supervisor because the guy was 
young. They give them positions as supervisors and all of the sudden it all goes to their 
heads. I want to say something here. I love my people. It's my people, my race. My own 
people. We come from other countries, from Mexico, from Chile, from different places. 
I mean, we come here, they get a job as a lead. Or even as a supervisor. Like me and not just 
me. Many of the Mexicans that are here, they grew up in farming communities back home. 
With horses and - livestock. They get a position of supervisor. They want to treat you just 
like an animal. We don't have anyone, before we used to have Lisa. Now we have no one to 
listen to us. We have to deal with our own problems by ourselves. Ever since the pandemic 
started. They just left us alone. All alone. Me, when new people come in. I tell them. "It 
doesn't what the supervisors or leads do to you - don't quit - just hang in there." Because 
they can't fire you. 
Unless they do something bad. Here, they get here and they go and they come. They go and 
they come. Why? Because supervisors aren't treating them well. The thing is, many people 
are not always mentally well, but they need to have the possibility of a job, to be self-
sufficient. 
23:15 
JM: What about COVID has been the most challenging for you as a custodian? How has it 
impacted you and your family? 
AS: We have a lot of depression. Because you're concerned about your kids. We aren't well 
because it's not just our kids were concerned about but people in general. So, there was a 
lot of depression all around. The university was totally empty - for a year and a half. It 
looked looked so so so abandoned. If you believe in God I think it helps you for your head. 
CT: Where you exposed to COVID or did you contract COVID? 
AS: No, thank God no. I think it's because we have that Native Indian blood because they're 
strong. No, thank God no, none of my kids got it either. 
CT: That's good. 
JM: What do you like to do when you are not working? 
AS: When I'm not working I help my daughters clean their houses. I have a daughter that has 
two cats - and she works a lot as well. The Saturdays I go wash her dishes, put things up for 
her. Because young people nowadays, they don't like cleaning the kitchen. I like sitting at 
home. I am up age at this point, I am 63 years old and I like watching TV. About three years 
back, I'm talking about three years ago, I liked to go and dance. But the pandemic put an 
end to that - and it sent us home. 
Transcription: Aurelia Saenz (English)

JM: What aspect of your work are you most proud of? 
AS: The thing is, I'm not perfect or anything. One of the things that I learned when I first 
came here is that we needed to give good customer service. I like having the computer 
tables and make sure that the students have clean tables. Especially now with the 
pandemic. Not all us work the same. I'm not expecting that someone does that. I decide to 
do what I'm assigned to do. All the proctors have loved me. 
CT: What kind of buildings do you work in? Art building, science buildings? 
AS: When I got here - for the night turn. We had seven buildings. Calden. Like eight or nine 
buildings. We were short-staffed. When it would snow - they had us shoveling all around. All 
the buildings we were shoveling. I really hold Jessica in high esteem. She got two supervisors 
and she divided them up. She divided up all the buildings. Now we're fine. I don't have any 
issues here because I don't want Jessica to have any problems because she's really helped 
us. Because you should be grateful to people who help you out. 
JM: What is the biggest challenge of your job? 
29:54 
AS: The hardest thing, really, the biggest challenge you have is trying to get along with the 
supervisors and the leads. Especially if they're Mexican. There's a supervisor. I don't work 
with him. Just sometimes when I worked overtime before. Not just him, there're also some 
Americans. They treat you well. Those supervisors do treat you well. There's really young 
leads and I've gone to work with them. They treat you with respect. But if I go to the 
Mexican - they're just snapping their fingers and making you run everywhere. I'm not 
speaking of my people because I'm Mexican myself. It's just what I see. This is part of our 
job because you really can't be causing problems for our managers. 
CT: That's difficult. 
JM: Could you tell us a little bit about the people you've worked with over the years? 
AS: Here at the university? 
CT: Maybe some of your favorite people over the years and what made them special. 
AS: There's a person who is retired already and she was a great person. She was a lead by 
the way. I worked with her for 11 years. She was or she is because she is still alive. Can I say 
her name? 
CT: Yes. 
AS: Emma, worked in engineering. She treated us really really well. She helped us out when 
we had to take the garbage out. She gave us overtime. 
CT: I remember her. 
Transcription: Aurelia Saenz (English)

AS: They said I'm somebody who doesn't strike out conversations, approach people easily. 
For example, in my case, if I see that somebody appears to be problematic. I rather just step 
back and get away from them. That's when they start talking about you. They say just 
because you stand beside, they start saying that you stand in the office, that you don't do 
duty. I really like interacting with people and respecting them. My coworkers or - 
supervisors. I don't get into the managers' business at all. Workers and supervisors that 
want to get in your business, that they want you to work. I don't really know what they want 
you to do. There's some people that don't do their work. They say, "This person doesn't do 
their job." They bug other people because they do their job. You just don't know. 
CT: How was Emma? How was Emma different? 
AS: She checked out the work that people did. She'd go to the buildings to see who's 
stealing stuff. She'll go from one building to another checking things up. Many people didn't 
like her to do that. But I did. Because I felt protected. Then Chris got there. When Chris got 
there. She is a good person too. Sometimes they start to get their heads boiling. Then they 
start thinking that they're God's gift. 
CT: As far as relationships at the university, the professors and the students. 
AS: There're professores here and in engineering as well, yes. That they really appreciate 
me. They see me sitting in number one and they say, "Hey, how are you doing?". The 
proctors of number two. They really appreciate myself. Because I clean up their kitchen. It's 
not just because of that. I also respect them. I need to know my place. I see that somebody 
is above me in their position. I respect that position. I would like to respect others so they 
would also in return respect me. 
CT: Very nice. 
AS: I was really happy in engineering. I didn't want to leave there. There's a lot of problems 
there. My blood pressure was getting too high, and my nose bleeds, my blood pressure was 
so high. 
CT: Oh my gosh. I'm glad you're here. 
AS: When I came over here. All that, the pressure was off of me, it finished. I went to see the 
doctor. When I came over here? Like in 2011 or no? In 2011 I came over here, I'm not sure. I 
came over here and I went to see the doctor because of my high blood pressure. They gave 
me heart pills. They gave me high blood pressure pills. They said I was pre-diabetic. They 
said I had a stomach infection. And who knows what other things that I don't remember. 
Then I said, "How will I take that many pills?". No. I put on my transfer. They gave it to me. I 
waited. 
Then three months went by. I went back to see my doctor. I went back to see my doctor, 
and I said to check everything up that they've already taken. He says, "You have nothing 
wrong with you." 
CT: Nice 
Transcription: Aurelia Saenz (English) 
7 
AS: When I came to work here. My tests showed up as pre-diabetic. 
Today I have no diabetes. Nothing. I just tell my supervisor that one needs to just be patient. 
So people could live longer. If somebody starts to bother me, I just wait. 
40:08 
CT: Do you have good benefits here? 
AS: Yes. The university has the best benefits. Years ago we didn't have a good salary. Like I 
said, I was only earning $1,200 dollars. But we did certainly have good benefits. In the 
university there's really good work. I tell the new people who start here that it is. Because of 
the insurance they gave you. Everything, all the benefits are really good. 
CT: Very nice. 
AS: I tell them. I told my kids when they started working, "Never work at Taco Bell or 
anywhere that does not have benefits. That I tell you." Thank goodness they do have good 
jobs with good benefits. 
CT: Nice. 
AS: The university is always good. 
JM: What is the biggest challenge you have overcome in your life? 
AS: Here at the university or--? 
CT: In your life. Over the years. 
AS: The biggest challenge for me was to make sure that my kids got ahead in life. I got 
married and I suffered a whole lot. Had my kids, I got a divorce. I then raised them all on my 
own. As a mother, I feel proud. I have a son in Texas who has four kids. Two years ago for a 
Thanksgiving. I said, "I'm going to go see how you live, son." Because I hadn't seen him for 
five years. I went down there for Thanksgiving. Lived at one of those little rooms, like those 
storage sheds at Home Depot. 
That's where they lived. That's where his wife lived - and the four kids. The bed like this, 
each one with their little TV and that's how they were living. I was so sad, so so sad. Then I 
said to myself, "Oh my God, what can I do now?". I went in and out, in and out. My 
daughter-in-law's father got me a house to stay there because I was only going for a week 
but then I decided to stay a little longer. 
When I was going to come back. I told my son and my daughter-in-law. I don't like how 
you're living. He said, "What do you want me to do? There's no work here". Then I said, 
"Here, take the keys to the house". "Give them to the gentleman". Tell him, "Thank you so 
much for letting me stay here". This house is going to be yours. 
Transcription: Aurelia Saenz (English)

They he looks at me and (inaudible) that I was going nuts or something. A week later. My 
daughter-in-law called me. She said that the gentleman decided to sell them the house for 
$20,000 with two bathrooms, five bedrooms, two living rooms. 
I had money from the flood that happened. I had some money that had gotten from it. I 
sent them that money right away with their taxes. It was $10,000 that I sent to them. They 
were able to raise the entire $20,000. Now they have their own house. You know this is 
really God. I really believe in God. There's people you talk to them about God and they get 
all mad at you. 
46:24 
JM: Tell me about a time when you needed to have courage. 
CT: It sounds like there are a lot of times in your life you had a lot courage. 
AS: I've always feel like I've put on this the armor of courage in my entire life and I've had to 
do it, because there's times that I feel I'm going to sway or fall over, and I just gird myself 
with that courage. Because I've worked a lot. I've worked a whole lot. Right now I don't have 
a place to live. Because I want leave my kids nor with my daughters. I want to live on my 
own. Rents are really expensive. We don't earn enough to pay for these rents. The 
electricity, the water and the gas, they're going up. They don't give us raises here at the 
university. It's been three years since they've given us the $50 a year they used to give us. 
Most of people just don't last here because with the price of gas and everything else going 
up so high. A lot of people have to hold down two jobs. The supervisors should be more 
understanding when people come in tired, because some of these people have four or 
upwards of five kids in their family. 
CT: Where are you staying now? If you don't mind. 
AS: I'm renting a studio. I'm paying $1,400 for it. Then I do pay $70 for the gas. Almost $80 
for the electricity. I'm spending a lot of gas with my car. I was in the vanpool. There was too 
many problems in the vanpool. I just decided to stop using it. It's really difficult. I don't know 
if I'll be able to last 20 years - or if I'm going to have to go and find another job because 
things are looking a bit tough. 
50:10 
JM: Who was the person or people who inspired you to be your best? 
AS: Here at work? 
CT: In your life. 
AS: Of the job here, I really love the students a lot. I like see them walk up and down. I like 
helping them out when they get a little bit lost. I really enjoy that. Yes. I don't know what 
will happen to me if I leave the university, to be honest, because I'm going to miss all that. 
That's what I like, my private life. You help your children grow up. But here in the United 
States, once your kids are about 21 you just send them on their way. But not in México. It 
Transcription: Aurelia Saenz (English)

doesn't matter how old your kid is, they are still your kids. You need to be there taking care 
of your kids. If I have four kids - but there's always one who gives me the most trouble. She's 
33 - but she acts as though as she was a kid. But I always leave my problems at the door. I 
don't bring them into work. I never told my supervisor, or my lead, or my coworkers. No, I 
keep them here with me. 
AS: I also have another daughter who is about 30 - and she doesn't want to have kids - 
because she's seen how hard has been for her older sister with two of them - because they 
mentally don't react like adults would. Sometimes I don't know what they really want. I have 
one that's given me a lot of trouble. It's been about a year since I told her she had to leave. 
It hurts, but - and I miss her - and that's hurting me but - sometimes I need to be hard. 
Because the day she doesn't have me, what is she going to do? She is a proud person. She 
hasn't called me since or any of that. If she tries to come looking for me, I said I was going to 
have to file a restraining order. I think that hurt her and that's why she has not tried 
anything. 
CT: Hopefully things will mend over time. 
JM: What are you most proud related to what you have created in your life? 
AS: The thing is I'm proud of that I work and that I've been able to be out on my own ever 
since I came to the United States. I still have a lot of family brothers, sisters, nephews, 
nieces. There's no communication among the family. I don't really seek them out either 
unless maybe somebody is ill or something. I am proud of the fact that - my daughters call 
me and they say, "Mom, I have this problem." My daughter would call and say, "Mom, I 
have a problem with a coworker at my job." I tell them, "Don't argue, don't fight." "if you 
have any issues go talk with your supervisor - because if you start aggravating her and she 
starts aggravating you, you are going to run into a conflict." I tell her, "You need to be like I 
am." It does work for me. Right now there's a lot of violence. If somebody comes and they 
aggravate me or they bother me - like when I was working during the day - my supervisor 
really got aggressive, inserting, "Bla, bla, bla." I just turned my face away from her. I did not 
answer anything. That's how I started gaining his trust, that I would just not respond. Until 
one day got to a really high threshold limit. Because I said to him, "You are a supervisor 
already - you can let the workers come and just get your head all boiling- you need to see 
with your own eyes." They sent him to classes - and he got better. 
58:19 
CT: One of the last questions that we have is, what advice would you give to somebody who 
is coming in as a custodian, brand-new, young? How would they make it to their 
retirement? 
AS: My big tip would be to tell them to get there and focus on your job. When the leads or 
the supervisors ask you a question, respond to them - but don't make big, convoluted 
conversations. That's my advice, focusing on work - respect each other and don't be 
aggravating people. The thing is with the aggression, the violence that is existing right now, 
it could be appealable under law. I say here at the university, we are well-protected. We 
Transcription: Aurelia Saenz (English) 
10 
have security. We have police. We have human resources. We have managers. If a 
supervisor or lead discriminated against us. Or they - or there's any preferential treatment. 
CT: Favoritism. 
AS: Favoritism. Because leads and supervisors have that bad habit of favoritism. They have 
favoritisms towards a certain person. That's what I find out. They need to treat us all the 
same. If we're American. Mexican, or from India, wherever. We need to treat everyone 
equal. Because there are people from India, people from Laos. Mexicans who don't know 
much English. Years prior, one of the human resources, she would explain to me, "We don't 
worry about English, we don't need English necessarily, but we definitely need hands that 
are willing do the labor that we have." 
CT: Nice. Have you been doing that for a long time? 
AS: Yes, many years. 
CT: Thank you for - everything that you do for the university. 
AS: One thing that I want to say is that, in the future, hopefully start enacting the fact that 
when you have a supervisor, that at minimum they have a high school diploma. You should 
be asking them for their high school diploma minimum. Because sometimes they know 
languages. English and Spanish, right? I mean, because really, they don't have right 
education level. Because you see a university student and then some dude just out in the 
street and you can see, you can clearly detect the difference in their education. 
CT: So get a high school? 
AS: At least a high school diploma. Because being a supervisor, that's a big position. 
Somebody can't just show up from another city and just say, "I'm just going to be your 
supervisor." No, they can't do that. In some (inaudible), some guys just come in and all of 
just right away they set them up as (inaudible). 
JM: I have one more question. After you retire - what do you want to do with your personal 
life - and how do you want to be remembered as a person? 
AS: That they remember me as I was, that I am not a hypocrite. If I have a problem with you 
- I'm a straight shooter, I go and tell you, "Hey". I don't like going to tell her before I talk with 
you, no, I like going - straight to the person I'm having the issue with. I would like to be 
remembered by that. I worked very nicely in the university. Even though my salary was low - 
I really liked working here. Sometimes you might not always cozy up to people as well as 
you'd like. Whenever problem, my brothers, my sisters already know all of my problems 
already. If they know that they offend me - I will open the door and leave. I don't sit around 
trying to figure things out or anything, I just leave. The only time I really get involved with 
any issues like that is if somebody tries to mess with my kids. If somebody says or does 
anything to my kids, I defend them. I really just do that. I don't take justice into my own 
hands, but -because there's a lot of assistance here at the university. Here, a lot of people, 
they come from factories. "In that factory, I was a lead and I used to do this and that." I tell 
them, "Here, this is the university." "There's rules here." "Here we are protected by the 
Transcription: Aurelia Saenz (English) 
11 
rules, the regulations they have." You can't go and accuse us of anything that we didn't do. 
If we are going to defend ourselves, we defend yourselves by legal means. 
CT: Thank you.Thank you so much. Does anyone else have a question? 
JM: Going back to the last question, the first part of last question. What do you want to do 
after you retire? 
AS: When I retire from here, I would like to work part-time somewhere else. Like maybe in a 
nursing home or helping out the elderly. There's so many things that one can do. Be a 
volunteer at a food bank.There's the Arrow Center. There's a place in Longmont for 
example, that's the Arrow Center 
CT: Our Center? 
AS: Our Center. O-U-R Center. That's for homeless. It's to help the homeless I believe, yes. 
Because if you give, God gives back that to you. I have $5 the other day I had $10. There was 
a guy with a big sign up and I grabbed $5 because (inaudible) and he was stopped there. I 
gave him $5. I do like to give to others. When I do a favor for someone - I'm not expecting 
anything in return. I only await something maybe from God, not from someone else. I like 
reading the Bible a lot. I don't go to any church in particular - because they ask for so much 
things. But I have a brother who is a minister. I have another brother who is a Jehovah's 
Witness. His wife worked here (inaudible) That's why I like the Bible. 
When I have nothing to do - I start reading the Bible and I focus on myself. If somebody ask 
me for a favor, I do it if I can. If I can't, no. But a lot of people take advantage sometimes. 
Yes. Especially the family. Especially family. Yes. But I like to help all people. It comes 
through the family. I come from good families. My mother was a very patient person. She 
lived 95 years. Because if you're getting mad all the time, that's how you get high blood 
pressure - that's where you get diabetes. You can't be getting angry just because. 
Sometimes my face looks like I'm really tired - or I have any problem, or like this and you 
might to think I'm angry, but I'm really not. No. When I'm really angry, I'll just lock myself up 
or I just get away from other people for a while. But many people are ill and they took a lot 
of pills. A lot of people take pills here, for diabetes. I shouldn't be so surprised or anything, 
because maybe someday I'll be having to take it too. But they really mess up with people 
because of their illness, they get a high blood sugar and - But they shouldn't take advantage 
of their illness just to be bothering other people either. There's illness that the people get 
and we need to know how to deal with them. Yes. 
That's why I don't even think of getting remarried. Then I'll be there, "Don't eat that, don't 
do that." No, I don't want that. Because men eat a whole lot more than me, that's their 
nature. Yes. I have a son like you, Jaime. But he's really hardworking. When he comes, he 
eats a heck of a lot. That's why I try to be patient. If I have to call the police - I call the police, 
if I need to. But if I note a homeless up there - homeless guys aren't doing anything to 
anyone. No reason to call the police on them. Leads are, "It's a homeless guy, just call the 
police." I'm like, "No." They're not hurting or bothering anyone. Only if you bother them or 
make them angry, yes. But I like it here. Here, I'm just hanging there. I just don't speak too

much anymore. Years ago I used to play around and just joke around - but now people is so 
sensitive. We need to see what they're saying and just gauge it. 
CT: I want to thank you for sharing your history today. 
AS: I just want to say. When I met you - when I see a person - I know if the person has a 
great personality. I always held you in the highest (inaudible) from the time I first met you. 
CT: Thank you. 
AS: Just like how she is, that's how I know how other people-- I'm really good at gauging 
where people are coming from and how they are. People who are really smart. I came from 
housekeeping. I stayed there because I didn't have any education. People who know English 
and Spanish. From Laos and English. There they are, in housekeeping. University gives 
opportunities to get your high school diploma here. A lot of opportunities that people need 
to take advantage of. But, who knows? Every mind is a world. 
CT: Thank you, Aurelia.
