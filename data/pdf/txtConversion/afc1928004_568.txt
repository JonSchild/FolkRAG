THERE NEVER WAS A COWARD WHERE THE 
SHAMROCK GROWS. 
As sung with great success by JOHNNY PATTERSON, the Great 
Irish Clown. 
LET cowardly slanderers say what they may 
Against the dear land of my birth, 
But I 
will maintain in spite of its foes 
It's the dearest green spot on this earth ; 
Some say we are cowards and fit for naught else 
But drinking our home-made potheen ; 
But I'll throw back the villainous lie in their face : 
"We're as brave as the shamrock is green. 
CHORUS. 
Pat may be foolish and very often wrong, 
Pat's got a 
temper which don't last very long, 
Pat is full of jollity, as everybody knows, 
But there never was a 
coward where the shamrock grows. 
Tho' oppressed and insulted for hundreds of years 
By the foe who once conquered them, they 
Have left us the courage our forefathers had, 
For that they cannot take away ; 
They kept learning from us, stole all we held dear, 
And crushed us till others cried shame ; 
But in spite of all we have struggled to learn 
That courage and wit are the same. 
Pat may be foolish, etc.

OH 
! Dan Mulligan is a 
man 
Of great fame and renown, 
His name it is a 
househeld world 
In the country and town ; 
At his breakfast last Tuesday morn 
To his fond wife he said, 
" 
Cordelia dear, next Monday night 
We'll have a 
masquerade. 
CHORUS. 
Faix, he ripp'd up the carpet, 
Took ehromos off the wall, 
And greas'd the floor with tallow, 
Piled the beds in the hall ; 
He order'd pots of chowder, 
Washtubs of lemonade, 
Invited all the neighbors 
To 'tend the masquerade. 
At nine o'clock Dan rung a 
bell, 
They all lept in the room, 
With black masks on their pale faces, 
On their shoulders a 
broom ; 
With sweet Cordelia on his arm 
Dan led the promenade ; 
'Twas then the fun began oh, oh, 
At Dan Mulligan's masquerade. 
Now Dan wore his short leg trousers 
And slippers on his feet, 
Cordelia in her snow white robes, 
Begorra, she look'd neat, 
And the blackbird Mrs. Allup, 
Dress'd as the Queen of May, 
Recited poor " Shamus O'Brien," 
While the guests did hooray. 
(1) 
ay.* 
DAN MULLIGAN'S MASQUERADE.—Concluded. 
CHORUS. 
Faix, Lemmons as a 
leapfrog 
Jump'd in the chowder pot, 
Dan pulled him out by the hair, 
And laid him on a 
cot; 
With a 
clothes-line they tied him 
On the tailor's humpback, 
And as he ran round the room 
All hands hit himsa whack. 
Tommy Fagin, in skin-tight pants, 
Danced the Society 
With big, fat Mrs. Loelimuller, 
How nice they dipp'd their knee; 
The great Walsingham McSweeney, 
Beside the keg he stayed, 
Singing Tom Moore's sweet melodies 
At Dan Mulligan's masquerade. 
At two o'clock they had supper 
In the back yard below; 
Rebecca pass'd the grub around, 
All hands " fill'd in," you know, 
And all at once they heard music 
Down in the alleyway; 
'Twas the " Full Moons" in full dress came, 
Their compliments to pay. 
CHORUS. 
Faix, Mulligan receiv'd them 
With a 
shower of red bricks ; 
The nagurs drew their razors, 
The lads fought with hay- sticks ; 
Mrs. Dublin scaled the fence, 
But a 
nail caught in her dress; 
There she hung calling for help, 
A 
widdy in distress. 
Captain Primrose on a 
shutter 
Was carried home to die, 
Dan Mulligan in a 
handcart 
Bid Cordelia good-bye; 
Some had lame legs, others black eyes, 
Troth, all hands dearly paid 
For all the pleasure that they had 
At Dan Mulligan's masquerade.

UPON the elevated train 
I 
often take a. 
ride. 
Along the second story rooms, 
The blinds are open wide ; 
Of course when I 
am looking out 
Some curious things I 
see, 
And now I'll try to tell of those 
That interested me. 
CHORUS. 
Riding on the Elevated Railroad train, 
In a 
cosy little seat beside the window pane, 
Many things I 
see of interest to me, 
While riding on the Elevated Railroad train. 
Now there's a 
little dwellling place, 
The folks are going to dine ; 
I 
see the table thickly spread 
With ev'ry thing that's fine, 
And here's a 
man with eyes intent 
Upon the morning news, 
And there's a 
fellow lies in bed, 
As if he had the blues. 
Riding on the, etc.

RIDING ON, THE ELEVATED RAILROAD. 
Concluded. 
Now here's a 
woman washing clothes 
With all her might and main, 
And there's a 
pretty sewing girl, 
Who glances at the train ; 
Oh ! there's a 
grand piano, 
And a 
lady seems to play, 
While near her hangs a 
little bird 
To sing its merry lay. 
Riding on the, etc. 
Oh ! here's a 
woman holding up 
A 
baby very small. 
And yonder sits a 
tailor 
With his back against the wall, 
While just beside two idle men 
Are seated, playing cards, 
And people here are drinking beer, 
With " mutual regards." 
Riding on the, etc. 
I 
see a 
picture of distress— 
A 
barely furnished room, 
Three little ragged children 
With their faces full of gloom. 
So many and so varied 
Are the sights that come to view 
I'm sure I'd try your patience 
If I 
told them all to you. 
Riding on the, etc.

SENSATIONS scarcely pass away 
When new ones are at hand; 
The latest is imported now 
From France to Yankee land ; 
With serenades and banquets, too, 
Receptions every day; 
A 
fortune we must own indeed 
To see Miss Sarah play. 
CHORUS. 
Have you seen Sarah ? ain't she a 
tearer ? 
None could be fairer than Miss Sarah B.; 
Froggies and poodles, claret and noodles, 
And a 
lot of Fitzfoodles ! oh ! parley vous ! Oui! 
Have you seen Sarah ? ain't she a 
tearer ? 
None could be fairer than Miss Sarah B.; 
Froggies and poodles, claret and noodles, 
And a 
lot of Fitzfoodles! ! parley vous! Oui 
One evening at the Albemarle 
I 
sought an interview; 
I 
saw her in the corridor, 
And to her side I 
flew; 
HAVE YOU SEEN SARAH ?—Concluded. 
Upon my knees I 
spoke of love 
And all my railroad shares; 
She raised her foot to my coat-tails 
And flung me down the stairs. 
Have you seen Sarah, etc. 
Her picture gallery is immense, 
At least so I 
have heard ; 
A " peck " she eats at every gulp, 
Just like a 
little bird. 
A 
sculptor too she claims to be, 
But tell you this I 
must— 
When chisling out a 
marble head 
She's always on a 
bust. 
Have you seen Sarah, etc. 
She's many cliromos, rich and rare, 
That she'll expose to you; 
"Twill cost you forty dollars to 
Obtain a 
single view. 
In fact, she is so awful thin, 
Before she leaves us yet, 
We'll use her for a 
piece of reed, 
On a 
yellow clarinet. 
Have you seen Sarah, etc. 
DON'T TOUCH HIM.

Waking darkeys at de break of de morn; 
So be dar, just as sure's you're born

De time am come for to flap your wing, 
So tell me what you're to sing, 
De angels am a-coming.

VHEN der angry passion gaddering in my mudder's face 
I 
see, 
Und she leads me in der pedroom, shendly lays me on 
her knee, 
Den I 
know dot I 
vill catch it, un.d my flesh in fancy 
itches 
As I 
lisd.en for der patter of der shingle on my breeches. 
Efery tingle of der shingle has an echo und a 
shding, 
Und a 
dousand burning fancies judo active being spring, 
Und a dousand bees and hornets 'nead my coad-dill 
seem to scwarm, 
As I 
feel der patter of der shingle, oh, zo varm. 
In a 
shplutter comes mine ladder—whom I 
supposed had 
gone— 
Do survey dey skiduvation, und dell her do lay it on, 
Do see her bending o'er me as I 
lisden do der strain 
Blayed by her und by der shingle in a 
vild und weird 
refrain. 
In a 
sudden indermission, vich appears my only schance, 
I 
say, " Shtrike shendly, mudd.er, or you'll shplit mine 
Sunday bants ;" 
She slitops a 
moment, draws her breath, der shingle holds 
aloft, 
Und says, " I 
had not thought of dot—mine son, shust 
dake dem off." 
Oh, lofing, tender mercy, cast dhy pitying glances down, 
Und dhou, oh, vamily doctor, put a 
good,soft bouldice on; 
Und may I

M Y 
name is McNamara, I 
came from County Clare, 
In the darling little isle across the sea, 
Where the mountains and the hills, the lakes and rip-
pling rills 
Are singing sweetest music all the day ; 
Our little farm was small, it would not support us all, 
So one of us was forced away from home; 
I 
bid them all good-bye, with a 
teardrop in my eye, 
And I 
sailed for Castle Garden all alone. 
CHORUS. 
I 
am an honest Irish lad, of work I'm not afraid ; 
If it's pleasure to you I 
will sing or dance ; 
I'll do anything you say if you'll only name the day 
When they'll give an honest Irish lad a 
chance. 
When I 
landed in New York I 
tried hard to get work, 
And I 
travelled through the streets from day to day ; 
I 
went from place to place, with starvation in my face, 
But every place they want no help they say ; 
But still I 
wandered on, a-hoping to find one 
That would give a 
lad a 
chance to earn his bread, 
But then it's all the same, for I 
know I'm not to blame, 
And oftentimes I 
wished that I 
was dead. 
I 
am an honest Irish lad, etc. 
But I 
know I've one kind friend who wifi lend a 
helping 
hand 
To a 
poor boy and to help him on at home; 
I 
will bring my mother here and my little sister dear, 
And never more again from them to roam; 
I 
will try to do what's right, I 
will work both night and 
day, 
Yes, I'll do the very best I 
can, 
And God will bless the heart that will take a 
poor boy's 
part, 
And make an honest Irish lad a 
man. 
I 
alp an honest Irish lad, etc.

For every time I

You are lovely as the prairie flow'rs that all around you 
bloom, 
Your step is graceful as the fawn, your breath is sweet 
perfume, 
Your eyes are dark as midnight, but full of love they 
glow; 
Mount your mustang and come with me; Bonita, don't 
say no; 
Mount your mustang and come with me; Bonita, don't 
say no. 
CHORUS. 
I'll range no more the chapparals or the plains 'gainst the 
Indian foe; 
Tear off my spurs with tinkling bells; Bonita, don't say 
no 
Your life shall be a 
happy dream; I'll be your humble 
slave; 
. 
Do not looli4trustful at me, believe me, I'm no knave; 
We met beneath the flash of lights in the gay fandango. 
I 
loved you then; I 
love you now; Bonita, don't say no. 
I 
loved you then, I 
love you now; Bonita, don't say no.

BONITA, 
DON'T SAY NO.—Concluded. 
My Texan cabin is of logs and stands by flowing stream, 
Shaded from the burning sun by branches ever green; 
Mustangs in plenty you can ride, where'er you choose 
to go; 
Come kiss me, senorita fair; Bonita, don't say no. 
Come kiss me, senorita fair; Bonita, don't say no. 
CHORUS. 
I'll range no more the chapparals or the plains 'gainst the 
Indian foe; 
Tear off my spurs with tinkling bells; Bonita, don't say 
no! 
The sweet scents from magnolias shall hover in the air, 
Mockingbird's songs and rippling streams shall drive 
away all care ; 
Then fly with me from the Rio Grande, put trust in 
" 
Texas Joe," 
Or my heart will break, my darling; Bonita, don't say 
no 
Or my heart will break, my darling; Bonita, don't say 
no. 
CHORUS. 
I'll range no more the chapparals or the plains 'gainst the 
Indian foe; 
Tear off my spurs with tinkling bells; Bonita, don't say 
! 
Bonita is the pet name addressed to any senorita you do not 
know the real name of, on the Rio Grande, and means in English 
pretty girl. 
The long rowelled Mexican spurs used by Texans 
also have little bells attached that tinkle as they ride.

SHE sat beside me in the church 
One beauteous Sabbath day; 
Such eyes I 
ne'er before had seen, 
As blue as skies in May; 
A 
face such as we sometimes dream 
Are met in fairer worlds, 
While 'neath her jaunty hat there peep'd 
A 
row of chestnut curls. 
CHORUS. 
A 
face such as we sometimes dream 
Are met in fairer worlds, 
While 'neath her jaunty hat there peep'd 
A 
row of chestnut curls. 
The sunbeams fell aslant upon 
The throng of worshippers, 
The soft airs flitted in and out 
Like viewless messengers ; 
The organ's tone ne'er seem'd so sweet, 
So thrilling, nor the pause 
That follow'd half so sacred; how 
I 
wonder who she was! 
A 
face such as we, etc. 
The preacher followed in discourse, 
And " angels " were his theme ; 
How day by day their footstep o 
fall 
Beside us all unseen ; 
I WONDER WHO SHE WAS.—Concluded. 
How oft they shield us from the ill, 
And cheer life's thorny way— 
I 
thought mine sat beside me there, 
Personified in clay. 
A 
face such as we, etc. 
And when my memory treach'rous pro'ved, 
Ah ! sweet misfortune's lot ! 
A 
dainty finger pointed out 
The sacred hymn forgot; 
How well our voices harmonized— 
I 
can't divine the cause ; 
But some new cause seeni'd to be woke— 
I 
wonder who she was! 
A 
face such as we, etc. 
The benediction resting on 
Each bowed devoted head, 
I 
wished them but the opening word 
Of ritual instead ; 
I 
took my hat to go like one 
Who leaves a 
charmed place, 
While 'mid that multitude I 
saw 
But one—an angel face ! 
A 
face such as we, etc. 
Sabbaths have come, and Sabbaths gone, 
Full many a 
time since then ; 
And I 
with care still seek me out 
The same seat—but in vain : 
That face is not in all that throng ; 
Still, ral'd by faith's stern laws, 
My heart repeateth o'er and o'er, 
"I wander who she was ! " 
A 
face such as we, etc.

THE shoemaker sat amid wax and leather, 
With lapstone over his knee ! 
Where, snug in his shop, he defied all weather ; 
Drawing his quarters and sole together, 
A 
happy old man was he. 
This happy old man was so wise and knowing, 
The worth of his time he knew ; 
He bristled his ends, and he kept them going, 
And felt to each moment a 
stitch was owing 
Until he got round the shoe. 
Of every deed that his wax was sealing 
The closing was firm and fast ; 
The prick of his awl never caused a 
feeling 
Of pain to the toe, and his skill in healing 
Was perfect and true to the last. 
Whenever you gave him a 
foot to measure, 
With gentle and skillful hand 
He took his proportions with looks of pleasure, 
As if you were giving the costliest treasure, 
Or dubbing him lord of the lane., 
And many a 
one did he save from getting 
A 
fever, a 
cold, or cough, 
For many a 
foot did he save from wetting, 
When, whether in water or snow ' twas setting, 
His shoeing would keep them off. 
When he had done with his making and mending, 
With hope and a 
peaceful breast, 
Thsigning his awl, and his thread was ending, 
He passed from his bench, to the grave descenaing, 
As high as a 
king to rest.

To catch the echo I

'Twas " sunshine after rain."

And don't give way to grief, 
For you are sure to find 
That crying's no relief; 
With spirits gay and free 
We'll sing the song again, 
For though the day be cloudy now, 
There's sunshine after rain. 
Throughout our daily life we see, 
'Midst people rich and poor, 
Some grumbling discontentedly 
For what ?—they are not sure !

If happiness they'd gain,

To gain a 
livelihood 
Perchance is happier than the king 
With comforts rare and good 
His wife and children also he 
Endeavors to maintain; 
For tho' it's hard times with him now, 
There's sunshine after rain. 
Be happy in your mind, etc. 
Now charity, you've heard it said, 
Should first begin at home, 
But there are people who suppose 
It should be there alone; 
Be kindly to the poor that wait 
In hopes your mite to gain, 
And whisper with a 
generous heart, 
There's sunshine after rain. 
Be happy in your mind, etc.

JAKE D YER loved a 
handsome girl, Maria was her name, 
And took her once to see New York, the country was so 
tame, 
And when she saw the Brooklyn bridge, which was way 
overhead, 
She ope'd her eyes with great surprise, and this is what 
she said— 
CHORE'S. 
Oh, what a 
beauty ! oh, what a 
beauty ! 
This is what Maria said unto Jake Dyer ; 
Oh, what a 
beauty ! oh, what a 
beauty ! 
I 
never saw the like before, Maria she did say. 
He took her then to Central Park the different things to 
see— 
The lake, the mall, the statues and the great menagerie, 
And when she sawAe bear stand up and lean upon a 
cane 
She grabbed his arm in great alarm and to him did ex-
claim--
Oh, what a 
beauty, etc. 
He took her then to Jerome Park to see the races there, 
The grand stand it was filled with men and women, oh 
so fair, 
And when she saw the tally-ho coach it nearly turned 
her head, 
And when they jumped the hurdle gates why this is what 
she said— 
Oh, what a 
beauty, etc. 
Now Jake felt awful when he found that his girl was so 
green, 
And started ere the race was over for to catch a 
train ; 
The people saw the hayseed sticking in Maria's head, 
They laughed and stood up in their seats, and this is 
what they said— 
enonts. 
Oh, what a 
beauty ! oh, what a 
beauty ! 
This is what they boller'd in a 
voice so solid ; 
Oh, what a 
beauty ! oh, what a 
beauty ! 
I 
never saw the like before, the people they did say.

Through the ages yet to be; 
Then, oh I 
lay me 'mid the roses, 
With their white wings over me, 
Lay me where the birds are singing, 
In the trees that round me wave ; 
I 
would have their music ringing, 
And bright flow'rs around my grave; 
Make no pile of sculptured marble, 
Let my resting only be 
Where the white buds of the roses 
Shed their incense over me. 
Birds shall sing, etc. 
Lay me where the birds are singing 
Songs of springtime o'er my tomb, 
Telling of the free soul winging, • 
Where immortal flowers bloom. 
Bud and blossom soft shall whisper 
Of the golden life to be; 
Then, oh! lay me 'mid the roses, 
With their white wings over me. 
Birds shall sing, etc.

WumE strolling by a

One evening in July, 
I 
met a 
maid so lovely, 
I 
winked at her so sly ; 
Her eyes shone like the brilliant stars 
That wink'd at us, you know; 
I 
took her hand and led her on, 
Down where the 
olets grow. 
CHORUS. 
For she is a 
fairy queen, 
The fairest ever seen ; 
I 
bless the day she came that way, 
Down where the violets grow. 
I 
gathered flowers and decked her hair, 
And called her my sweet dove ; 
She whispered very softly, 
" 
You are the one I 
love I" 
I 
asked her then to come again 
Where the waters rippling flow ; 
S:le murmured as she kissed my cheek, 
Down where the iiolets grow.

Also the place where I 
was born. 
But Nellie my darling awaits my return, 
Her sweet face I'm longing to see. 
There's a 
sigh in my heart which keeps whisp'ring, 
There's a

CHORUS. 
I'll soon return to my home again; 
How happy then I 
will be, 
When I'm welcom'd back by my Nellie, 
For my darling is waiting for me. 
I've travell'd across the ocean wide, 
And in strange countries have I 
been ; 
I've been among people of all kinds, 
But no place like home have I 
seen; 
I'm longing to be back with my little dear, 
To my home across the wide sea ; 
Oh, I'm weary and sad since we parted, 
There's a 
dear one waiting for me. 
I'll soon return, etc. 
While thinking about my childhood's days, 
When I 
used to play on the green, 
How oft I've roam'd with my Nellie dear; 
I 
love to recall those bright scenes, 
Remember'd and cherish'd are those childish hours; 
A 
wand'rer no longer I'll be, 
For my darling is waiting and watching, 
There's a 
dear one waiting for me. 
I'll soon return, etc.

Now, kind friends, do look at me, 
And an °le man you will see, 
Just climbing sixty-nine but yesterday 
I 
can tell you all a 
riddle, 
I 
can dance and play de fiddle, 
As in de days gone by of Henry Clay; 
Dem was de good old times, 
When you could save de climes, 
But now clat time am gone and pass'd away 
But give me de days of old, 
And my story am soon told, 
When old man Hickory Jackson had his day. 
(Dance.) 
One thing more I'd like to say 
Just before I 
go away, 
Of de times I 
used to have in Dixie's land ; 
I 
use to hoe de corn 
From de breaking of de morn, 
And many a 
clod of earth has bruise'd dese hands, 
But when de work was done 
We darkeys had de fun ; 
Ole Massa got our jug and clear'd de way 
For de old Yirginny reel, 
From de toe down to de heel, 
Dat's when old man Hickory Jackson had his day.

IN 
de evening by de moonlight, 
When dis darkey's work was over, 
We would gather round de fire 
Till de hoecake it was done; 
Den we all would eat our suppers, 
After dat we'd clear de kitchen, 
Dat's de only time we had to spare 
To have a 
little fun. 
Uncle Gabe would take de fiddle down 
Dat hung upon de wall, 
While de silver moon was shining clear and bright; 
How de old folks would enjoy it, 
Dey would sit all night and listen. 
As we sang in de evening by de moonlight. 
CHORUS. 
In de evening by de moonlight, 
You could hear us darkeys singing, 
In de evening by de moonlight 
You could hear de banjo ringing; 
How de old folks would enjoy it, 
Dey would sit all night and listen 
As we sang in de evening by de moonlight. 
In de evening by de moonlight, 
When de watchdog would be sleeping 
In de corner by de fireplace, 
Beside de old armchair 
Where Aunt Chloe used to sit 
And tell de picaninnies stories, 
And de cabin would be filled 
With merry coons from far and near; 
All dem happy times we used to have 
Will ne'er return again, 
Everyting was den so merry, gay and bright, 
And I 
never will forget it 
Just as long as I 
remember, 
How we sang in de evening by de moonlight. 
In de evening, etc.

don't you feel downhearted, Kitty, 
Those bitter tears you now must keep, 
For I 
would not grieve you, Kitty, 
For can I 
see my darling weep ? 
Yes, yes, to-morrow I 
must leave thee, 
For then I'll have to say good-bye; 
Oh, promise that you'll not forget me, 
Just kiss me and I'll tell you why ;

Ever since that day we met, 
And when you whisper'd yes, dear Kitty, 
And promised never to forget ;

And yet I've got to say good-bye;

My 
life like a 
flower has been nipp'd in the bud, 
My heart, if I 
own such a 
thing, 
By man, cruel man, has been broken in bits, 
But still to this false one I 
cling ; 
I 
loved him, alas ! but he didn't love me, 
The feeling is hard to explain ; 
I 
try to throw care to the wind, but I 
feel 
I 
shall never be happy again. 
CHORUS. 
I 
shall never be happy again, 
I 
shall never be happy again, 
Till I've gained your good graces, 
And kissed all the men's faces, 
I 
shall never be happy again. 
I 
feel as though water was poured down my back, 
Or a 
giant had trod on my corn ; 
I 
think till I'm vexed that each moment's my next, 
He caused me to feel so forlorn ; 
I 
Oft start to cry, and fancy I'll die, 
Although I 
don't feel any pain ; 
Till tomcats won't fight or rake out at night, 
I 
shall hover be happy again.. 
CHORUS. 
I 
shall never be happy again, 
I 
shall never be happy again, 
Till Sara Bernhardt 
Shall be cast for my part, 
I 
shall never be happy again. 
My life like a 
flower has been nipp'd in the bud, 
My heart, if I 
own such a 
thing, 
By woman, fair woman's been broken in bits, 
But still to this fair one I 
cling ; 
( ) 
I SHALL NEVER BE HAPPY AGAIN. 
Continued. 
I 
loved her, alas ! but she didn't love me; 
The feeling is hard to explain ; 
I 
try to throw care to the wind, but I 
feel 
I 
shall never be happy again. 
CHORUS. 
I 
shall never be happy again, 
I 
shall never be happy again, 
Till girls in their teens 
Don't know what love means, 
I 
shall never be happy again. 
Her pa was a 
merchant in muffins and shrimp; 
Her mother, a 
worthy old dame, 
Very often would say in a 
jocular way, 
" 
Our Lucy will soon change her name." 
Alas ! she has changed it, but it was not for mine ; 
The thought of it drives me insane, 
And till prisoners in jail are all out on bail, 
I 
shall never be happy again. 
CHORUS. 
I 
shall never be happy again, 
I 
shall never be happy again, 
Till the corns on my toes 
Grow bang on my nose, 
I 
shall never be happy again. 
ENCORE CHORUSES. 
I 
shall never be happy again, 
I 
shall never be happy again, 
Till our filend. Dr. Tanner 
Lives a 
year on a 
bananner, 
I 
shall never be happy again. 
I 
shall never be happy again, 
I 
shall never be happy again, 
Till Mrs. Hayes thinks 
It is best to mix drinks, 
I 
shall never be happy again.

Concluded. 
I 
shall never be happy again,

Till Bergh and his cats 
Live together in flats, 
I 
shall never be happy again. 
I 
shall never be happy again, 
I 
shall never be happy again, 
Till the smells in the street 
Grow delicious and sweet, 
I 
shall never be happy again. 
I 
shall never be happy again, 
I 
shall never be happy again, 
Till the L 
roads decide 
To charge five cents a 
ride, 
I 
shall never be happy again. 
I 
shall never be happy again, 
I 
shall never be happy again, 
Till the Danas and Grants 
Wear the same pair of pants, 
1 
shall never be happy a
gain. 
I 
shall never be happy again, 
I 
shall never be happy again, 
Till Hancock shall tote 
The unanimous vote, 
I 
shall never be happy again, 
I

I 
shall never be happy again. 
Till Bob Ingersoll tell 
How to prosper in— well,

IN 
Scotland's fair land, o'er mountains and rills, 
That's where I 
roamed for many a 
day, 
In looking at the lads and lassies on the green, 
In the fair old land of Scotland far away. 
I 
have waited for her coming, but she has not come as 
yet ; 
The truth seems to dawn upon me plain ; 
They say she is false, but I 
still believe her true— 
She's my darling blue-eyed Scotch l6.ssie, Jean. 
CHORUS. 
Oh I 
Jean, my bonnie Jean, come to your laddie once 
again 
µof • 
They say you are false, but I 
still believe you mine, 
You are my bonnie blue-eyed Scotch lassie, Jean. 
She said she would meet me, but I've waited long in 
vain— 
In lands far away she does roam; 
Her promise she will keep; ohI break it not, my Jean; 
We'll be happy in our bonnie little home. 
Oh! then let me not long wait, let me meet thee soon, my 
Jean, 
And the heavens will smile on our love, 
And when life is dead, we will leave this earthly scene, 
And our hearts will dwell in joy and bliss above. 
Oh I 
Jean, my bonnie Jean, etc.

GRANDMOTHER'S BIG HEART. 
A IR.—" Grandmother's Old Arm Chair," by W21. CAnnor.z. 
My grandmother she at the age of twenty-three 
Was found sitting on my grandfather's_clock; 
Her hair 
silvery red, and she never slept in bed, 
And done washing for the babies in our block. 
She never wore the pants, but was good to all the 
tramps, 
And her heart is big as any paving stone. 
When she cashed in her checks they could not find her 
specs, 
And she left me her brother's old trombone. 
now I 
hollered, how I 
swore— 
My last winter's ulster into rags I 
tore ; 
When the police put me in jail 
There was no one in the city who'd go my bail. 
My cousin who's away got a 
bale of salt-marsh hay, 
But he gave it to a 
man who is not born, 
And poor old Uncle Dan received a 
Cincinnati ham, 
With a 
cross-grained paralytic ear of corn ; 
And there was old Aunt Sallie who lives in our dark 
She got a 
yard of second-handed lace, 
And then my brother Ed got a 
loaf of home-made bread, 
Who was never known to wash his dirty face. 
CHORUS. 
Oh such kicking, such a 
time, 
With my sister's husband singing " Baby mine :" 
Around his neck I'd like to tie a 
rock, 
And smash him in the necktie with my grand-
mother's sock.

THE daisy soldier boys, the Hickory Rangers file away, 
rare battalion of renown, who'd fight as tho' ' twere 
play ; 
Oh I 
it's strained with admiration is the glance of ey'ry 
lass, 
When tramping by with

Boldly they tramp away without a

Scowling as though they wished a 
foe were near, 
On to the field they'd march away so wild, 
It's cannons they would love to bear, instead of the 
muskets mild.

Down from their picnic, thro' the streets at night, 
Pass all the AValTiOrS, bathed in calcium light, 
Bent low with prizes, grabb'd, and clutch'd, and won, 
Alive with home-made glory, solid Hickories ev'ry one.

Since that bright happy day 
When light of purest love illumed 
My soul with lustrous ray ; 
Au ! blissful words to say, 
In love's impassioned way, 
"My darling, by thy side, 
I 
could live and love alway," 
With beating heart I 
asked if augh 
Our bonds of love could sever ? 
For answer came the whisper low,

For answer came, the whisper low,

In love's own language oft we weave 
Our golden dreams of pleasure, 
By strength of loyal trust that lives 
Our future joy we measure : 
Each tender glance reveals 
The warmth the spirit feels, 
While merry chimes of joy 
Thro' the heart gayly peals 
Endearing words, so soft and shy, 
Of love that withers never.

DEAR friend, I 
wish to show you bow 
I 
charm the gents that gaze at me, 
Some say I'm a 
flirt, but here 
I 
vow that such a thing I 
ne'er would be ; 
This fan which dangles at my side, 
Brings lovers here from far and near, 
And when their pleadings are denied, 
They look so sad and sigh, " 0, dear I" 
I 
wave my fan just so, 
Then love begins to grow ; 
Sometimes I 
laugh at the foolish young men, 
Ah, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha foolish young men. 
cuonus. 
This is how I 
use my fan, 
With glances bright and love's delight, 
When I 
want to charm a 
man, 
This is how I 
use my fan. 
When at the op'ra or the ball 
I "do " the graceful like a 
queen, 
I'm sure to take the shine oft all ; 
They make me quite a 
heroine. 
Sometimes I 
know not what to do 
To keep ibtruding 2ent.s at bay ; 
The tales they tell make me rebel, 
And thus I 
wave them all away. 
I 
wave my fan just so 
To make them conic or go. 
None can resist it when held in my hand, 
All must obey its bewitching command. 
This is how, etc. 
If gentlemen will fall in love, 
It's not my fault I 
do declare, 
They do all sorts of things to prove 
Their adoration and despair. 
Some kneel before me on the floor 
And talk so sweet they make me blush ; 
They squeeze my hands and make them sore 
Then I 
look down and say, " 0, hush ! 
Get up, get up, young man, 
I 
shall strike you with my fan ! 
Off with your nonsense and foolish display— 
I 
can't allow it—now please go away." 
This is how, etc.

When he borrows your money you're loser, 
The snoozer with the terrible gall. 
He has got an eye in his head like a

And his neck is as long as a

He eats gruel that is made out of sawdust, 
Mixed up with a

His clothes would cover a

Shoot him with a 
big cannon ball; 
You bet that lie never would drop—

I'M ONE OF THE BOYS. 
Music and words by J. F. 
SHERIDAN. 
M ERE'S a 
circle of young men in this town, 
A merry set are we ; 
Our motto is, friendship—purpose, fun ; 
We're happy, gay, and free ; 
A 
cosy club- room we have got, 
In a 
fashionable street, 
And two or three times every week 
The jolly boys there meet. 
SPOKEN.— Yes, assembled together we sit and talk over the 
topics of the day, and when I 
look around me and sea a 
dozen 
of the best hearted fellows in the world, I'm really proud to 
say that— 
CHORUS. 
I'm one of the boys, one of the boys— 
Always so happy when making a 
noise; 
I'm one of the boys, one of the boys— 
I'm happy to say that I'm one of the boys. 
Together we sit, and talk and chat— 
Music, laughter, song, 
It fills the air for squares around, 
But nothing e'er goes wrong ; 
Content we are to share alike 
Each others' cares and joys ; 
Hand in hand, and true as steel, 
You'll find the jolly boys. 
SPOKEN. —
Yes ; 
if misfortune in any way befalls one of us, 
the others don't forget their untOrtunate companion. 
Oh, no! 
for at his side to cheer and comfort him in the hour of affliction 
you'll find— 
One of the boys, etc. 
At billiards, rowing, base-ball, too, 
The boys are number one; 
In fact, in all the sports of life 
We're always in : or fun ; 
Invitations we receive 
To every fancy ball; 
Dressed up in style the boys you find 
Observed by one and all.

DON'T YOU DO IT. 
Sung by W. E. LYLE, 
rik, give to you some good advice, 
All in a 
friendly way, 
Concerning things that oft occur— 
That happen every day. 
When hard times stare you in the face, 
- And pocket-books are thin, 
Don't say there's no use trying, 
If you do you'll never win. 
CIIORI:S. 
Don't you do it, don't you do it, 
For you know it never pays; 
Don't you do it, don't you do it, 
Wait for better days. 
Don't you do it, don't you do it, 
Never give yourself away ; 
Don't you do it, don't you do it, 
Mind what I 
say. 
Don't fret because your clothes are old, 
But keep your heart all right; 
Don't swear because you cannot sport 
A 
diamond pin to-night. 
Don't make love to a 
strange young girl, 
And say she charms your life, 
But first be careful that 
She ain't somebody's wife. 
Don't you do it, etc. 
Don't laugh at other pectple's faults, 
But first look at your own ; 
When friends are few because you're down, 
Just go it all alone. 
And when good luck comes on once more, 
I 
hope you wont wait long, 
And while you spend your greenbacks, 
Don't forget this little song. 
Don't you do it, etc.

FREDERICK ALPHONS O. 
Sung by TONY PASTOR. 
I'm Frederick Alphonso, a 
swell superfine, 
My clothes are all cut in the latest design, 
Two yards of necktie and gloves rather small,_ 
My figure and manner eclipses them all; 
Some think I'm a 
Count from a 
far foreign shore, 
But no—I'm a 
clerk in a 
large dry goods store ; 
I 
sell the ladies their ribbons and bows, 
Each one is delighted as from me she goes. 
SPOKEN.—Yes ; 
I 
make a 
favorable impression on the 
ladies—I 
mean, of course, the young ladies. 
The other 
day one came in, and sitting down on the little revolving 
stool, said, " Heigh ho !" " High hose, did you say, 
'miss ? 
Certainly, we have them very high. 
Do you 
went 'em plain or striped ?" 
She blushed, and said she 
ilidn't mean that—she was only sighing. 
Well, no won-
4er—that's the way with all the girls—because you know, 
C1101tUS. 
I'm Frederick Alphonso, the king of the swells; 
Frederick Alphonso can charm all the girls ; 
The ladies adore me, and say I'm divine ; 
I'm Frederick Alphonso—a swell superfine. 
I 
wear a 
bouquet in my cream-colored coat, 
And great standing collars encircle my throat; 
I ' stand up " my tailor till fortune is kind ; 
When dressed up in style many friends I 
can find, 
The wealth and the fashion invite me to dine, 
It makes the girls jealous if I 
should decline ; 
They'll have none but me for a 
walk or a 
dance, 
For Frederick Alphonso their hearts can entrance. 
I'm Frederick Alphonso, etc. 
- 
When business is over I 
walk up Broadway, 
I 
dine at the club when we close for the day; 
I 
call on Miss Flimsy and chat for a 
while, 
She says I'm "recherche" in figure and style ; 
She talks French and Spanish, and wants to learn Greek, 
From morning to night she sings " speak to me, speak ;" 
She's bright as a 
fairy and gentle and mild ; 
Besides, she is rich, and her pa's only child. 
SPOKEN.—And she realizes the important fact that—

O'FATJ,ERAN, THE BRAVE POLICEMAN. 
A new and original song, written and sung by WiLuela SCANLAN, in hia 
new and original sketch, entitled, " Wanted, a 
Lodger; Or, 
The Life of a 
Mulberry street Policeman." 
MY 
name is O'Halleran, and from Ireland I 
came, 
And since I 
came here I've gained great fame; 
The captains and aldermen all know me well, 
And my heroism and bravery they can easily tell; 
If at night on my beat as I 
walk to and fro, 
The blackguards they see me, arrah, from me they'll go, 
To an alleyway or bar-room they'll run if they can, 
For they all know well I'm a 
brave policeman. 
ClIORUS. 
For as I 
promenade my beat at night through the street 
I'm admired by every young lady I 
meet; 
You'll hear them all sigh as hard as they can, 
For they're all deep in love with this brave policeman. 
When I 
first came from Ireland I 
was rather green, of course, 
But I 
very soon got smart when I 
went on the force; 
'Twas then I 
plucked up, and my courage did show, 
And was greeted no matter where'er I 
did go; 
As we led the parade on Saint Patrick's day, 
You can bet we looked grand as we all marched away; 
My countrymen would shout " hurrah for O'Halleran, 
lie's the pet of the force, and a 
brave policeman." 
For as I 
promenade, etc. 
I 
was very soon promoted to a 
roundsman you see, 
And respected no matter where'er I 
might be; 
They put sthripes on my arms to look solid and grand, 
For they knew I 
was a 
hero from dear Paddy's land; 
But it's very strange, my friends, if I 
don't soon be mayor, 
For there's not a 
man more able or fit for that chair, 
And providing they will, I'll do everything I 
can 
"to houlli iny reputation as a 
true Irishman. 
For as I 
promenade, etc. 
BIDDY DOYLE. 
48 
Sung by JOHNNY ROAC11. 
! 
I 
nave come over here, Biddy Doyle, 
For to tell you pretty clear, Biddy Doyle, 
For to gain your heart and hand, 
As you will understand, 
And to be at your command, Biddy Doyle. 
So I 
will always prove true, 
No matter what you do, 
And I 
will stick to you like glue, Biddy Doylt 
Oh! the summer is past and gone, Biddy Doyle, 
And the winter is coming on, Biddy Doyle ; 
And the stormy winds will blow, 
It will hail, rain and snow. 
And what will become of you, Biddy Doyle, 
What will you do at all, 
When the snow begins to fall, 
With your back against the wall, Biddy Doyle'? 
You know how it is yourself, Biddy Doyle, 
You will soon be on the shelf, Biddy Doyle ; 
You know you are old enough, 
And your face is getting rough, 
Another year will make you tough, Biddy Doyle. 
So leave off your lamentation, 
And increase the population, 
Or you are not worthy of your nation, Biddy Doyle. 
Oh ! when I 
go on a 
spree, Biddy Doyle, 
I 
will raise lots of fun, you'll see, Biddy Doyle ; 
If I 
should come home tight, 
Don't try to raise a 
fight, 
Or I'll give you a 
box that will make you quiet, Biddy Doyle; 
Don't call the neighbors around me, 
Or if you do I'll surely pound you, 
And I 
will spit on you and drown you, Biddy Doyle.

SOMEBODY'S MOTHER. 
TIIE woman was old and ragged and gray, 
And bent with the chill of the winter's day ; 
The street was wet with a 
recent snow, 
And the woman's feet were aged and slow. 
She stood at the crossing and waited long, 
Alone, uncared for, amid the throng 
Of human beings who passed her by, 
Nor heed the glance of her anxious eye. 
Down the street with laughter and. shout, 
Glad in the freedom of " school let out," 
Came the boys like a 
flock of sheep, 
Hailing the snow pile white and deep. 
Past the woman so old and gray 
Hastened the children on their way, 
Nor offered a 
helping hand to her, 
So meek, so timid, afraid to stir, 
Lest the carriage wheels or horses' feet 
Should crowd her down in the slippery street. 
At last came one of the merry troop— 
The gayest laddie of all the group ; 
He paused beside her, and whispered low, 
" 
I'll help you across if you wish to go." 
Her aged hand on his strong young arm 
She placed, and so, without hurt or harm, 
He guided the trembling feet along, 
Proud that his own were firm and strong. 
Then back again to his friends he went, 
His young heart happy and well content. 
" 
She's somebody's mother, boys, you know, 
For all she's aged and poor and slow ; 
And I 
hope some fellow will lend a 
hand 
To help my mother, you understand, 
" 
If ever she's poor and old and gray, 
When her own dear boy is far away." 
And " somebody's mother " bowed low her head 
In her home that night, and the prayer she said 
Was, " God be kind to the noble boy, 
Who is somebody's son and pride and joy !" 
STOLEN KISSES ARE THE SWEETEST-
Sung with great 
success by the marvellous male soprano 
,
I.A.Bitt. 
PIERON. 
Now, some may call 1113 bashful, 
But I'll prove that I 
am right ; 
We girls should ne'er give kisses, 
Don't treat the matter light ; 
I 
love my Charley dearly, 
For in my heart I 
feel it; 
But if he asks me for a 
kiss, 
I'll make him try to steal it 
CHORUS. 
Stolen kisses are the sweetest 
When they're taken on the sly ; 
Often you may steal another, 
That is, if there's no one nigh. 
I 
often go to parties 
Where I'm sure to be the belle ; 
listen with attention 
To the tales of love they tell. 
And when the ball is over 
They see me to the door ; 
Then there's a 
chance to steal a 
kiss. 
I 
wish they'd steal some more. 
Stolen kisses., eie. 
THE OLD-FASHIONED CRADLE. 
Published by BALMER and W EBER, St. Louis, Mo. 
Written and sung by FRANK' DUMONT. 
OH the old broken crib's laid aside in a 
room 
Where the dust almost hides it from view ; 
Oh ! ' tis many years ago since it saw the light of day ; 
And the old-fashioned cradle then was new. 
Little baby heads have rested slumb'ring in this little bed 
While my mother sang and moved it to and fro ; 
And my sisters and my brothers, whom I 
ne'er shall see 
again, 
Were rocked in this old cradle years ago. 
CHORUS. 
Rock ! rock ! rock ! mother's voice I 
hear 
Singing baby songs so sweet and low; 
Her loving form I 
see, watching while the baby sleeps, 
And she rocks this little cradle to and fro. 
Oh ! I 
love the broken crib for the sake of other days, 
For the sake of my mother gone above ; 
Who kissed my eyelids down, awl she taught my little 
pray'r, 
'Twits the kiss of my mother's boundless love. 
She often watched beside it to protect us from all harm, 
And with anxious care each motion seemed to be ; 
Oh ! ' tis sacred for the mem'ries that it brings my lonely 
heart, 
The old-fashioned cradle's dear to me. 
Rock ! rock ! rock ! etc.

Composed by CHAS. SCHAEFFER. 
UNSENL, sweet music, thy golden store; 
Song's tuneful balsam around me pour!

You have heard them sing of a 
hero bold, 
Mulcahy was his name, 
And, faith, he had a 
sister too, 
Was noted for her fame ; 
She was chief cook in a 
boarding house, 
And at making hash was great; 
She came from the County Dyneffole, 
And her maiden name was Kate.

She is tall and thin, 
With her crooked shin ; 
Tier cheeks was red, and so was the herc4('i 
Of Mulcahy's sister Kate. 
klhe treats me like a

When her I

She takes me into the kitchen, 
And treats me to cake and tea, 
And °Mimes I 
used to sit until 
It was very late, 
And whisp'ring my love story to 
M"ulcahy's sister Kate. 
I 
thought she was an angel 
When I 
kept her company; 
But in the course of time I 
found 
That she was fooling me ; 
I 
went to her house one night, 
And standityr by the gate, 
I 
saw a

A- hugging my darling Kate.

THE APOLOGY- TO O'REILLY. 
NOT a 
hundred yards from where I 
stand, 
In this our glorious Union land, 
Is kept a 
first-class liquor stand 
By a 
man whose name's O'Connor. 
There's a 
man who's known both near and far, 
Who attends to Mike O'Connor's bar; 
Who, in our late war received no scar, 
And his name it is O'Reilly. 
Beneath our banner's starry wave, 
There's not a 
man fought half so brave, 
Or half the money for whiskey gave, 
As did McDermott. 
O'Connor's bar-room blazed with light 
On that eventful, bloody night 
That McDermott had the fearful fight 
With O'Reilly. 
With sleeves rolled up McDermott stood, 
And vowed he'd die before he would 
Say the slightest word that could, 
In any manner, be misconstrued 
Into an apology to O'Reilly. 
With a 
frowning brow and flashing eye, 
O'Reilly collared a 
glass of rye, 
Which he devoured without a 
sigh, 
Then turning to McDermott, said, 
" 
You alchoholic vat, you drunken loon 
You've no more sense than a 
gossoon !" 
"Be Heavens ! 
I'll make you change your tune,' 
Says McDermott. 
McDermott went for O'Reilly's nose, 
And on it planted fearful blows, 
Till o'er his eye a 
shanty rose, 
Erected by McDermott. 
O'Reilly fell into a 
swoon, 
With his head jammed in a 
big spittoon, 
And dreaming of Barnum's big balloon,

THE BAXTER-STREET SHEENEY. 
Written by JACK CONROY expressly for FRANK Busn, and was the hit of 
the season in all the leading Variety Theatres. 
, my name ig Isaac Moses, I'm a 
bully sheeney man; 
I

dollar any way I

I

And all the boots in Baxter street are made the same by

SPOKEN.—I 
vas selling a 
fur beaver to a 
friend of mine 
from Vail street last veek. He says I 
charge him ten dol-
lar for a 
suit, vich vas too much. I 
says, " You better go 
(1) 
up to the Blackvell's Island and get a 
suit for nothing, 
vid board thrown in." A 
soldier came in vid a 
pair of 
boots and no soles. 
I 
says, " Vat's dis ?" 
He says, 
" 
the soles fell off." " Vat ! you valked in dose boots! 
My friend, dose vas not valking boots ; they vas ealvalry 
boots, for riding only." 
in come a 
piviter vit a 
coat like 
the tatooed Greek. 
He says, " Vat are you giving me a 
a coat like this ? all the dye run out of it." 
I 
say, 
"Young feller, you yore dis in de vetter." 
He says, 
" 
Certainly." " Ali, ha ! I 
thought you vanted a 
ball-
room coat." " Vell," he says, " have you got a 
plum-
colored coat for pie-me purposes ?" I 
says, " Dere's one." 
He says, " You lie, dat's green. 
You think I'm a 
-variety 
performer." I 
laughed at him, and says, " I 
bet you doe 
cigars its plum color." 
He bet me, and I 
says, " Ain't 
de plum green before it's ripe ? " " Ah, " he says, " it's 
N. G.,' and it smells." " Not de coat, my friend, it's 
me dat smells. 
Come, vat vill you give for it ?" 
He 
says, " It don't suit me." I 
says, " Make me an offer." 
" 
Six shillings," he says. " Goodness gracious, talk easy. 
Don't let my wife Rachel hear you. 
She got the heart

So I 
had to let him have it, as 
it was Monday, and I

I AM paying my addresses to a 
lady rich and fair, 
She is very fond of music, she can sing most any air, 
To the Grand Italian Op'ra she was much inclined to go, 
So I made the preparations and we went to see the

I'm no great judge of music, I 
admire a 
good brass band, 
But these high toned foreign op'ras I 
can never under-
stand. 
CHORES. 
There's an elegant soprano, and a 
heavy baritone, 
There's a 
double barrell'd basso with a 
deep and mighty 
groan, 
There's a 
chorus loudly shouting, there a 
tenor soft and 
bland ; 
With fiddles, flutes and kettledrums all gathered in the 
band. 
There I 
sat like one enchanted, and I 
could not move or 
speak, 
My companion was delighted, but to me it 
was all 
Greek ; 
There was sighing, there was crying, there was singing, 
there was woe, 
And it made me almost crazy when I 
heard the trumpets 
blow. 
The tenor sang a 
solo, till his face got very red, 
And when the bass began to bawl I 
thought he'd bust his 
head. 
There's an elegant, etc. 
I 
remained a 
quiet list'ner and my eyes began to close. 
At the height of the performance I was sunk in deep 
repose. 
While unconsciously I 
slumbered, loudly I began to 
snore, 
Then a 
gentlemanly usher dragged me fainting to the 
door. 
I 
soon came to my senses, and since then I've Laken care 
To keep clear of operatics, for they drive me to despair, 
There's an elegant, etc.
