HE. 
Now my old wife and I 
we jogger together, 
As happy as happy can be; 
We have got a 
boy, our darling, our joy, 
He looks like his old man, the folks say to me. 
He dances and sings, does all funny things,, 
And Lena our daughter, is almost as bad; 
So when he get older, he go for a 
soldier, 
May Heaven protect him, and watch o'er our boy, 
CHORUS. 
God bless our boy, our narling, our joy, 
. May Heaven protect him, 
God bless our boy. 
SHE. 
Now old man don't worry, that boy's in no hurry, 
To go leave his old home with strangers to rosin 
So don't you be scolding that boy to beholding, 
Or else he'll go leave you and I 
here alone. 
We raised him you know with a 
parents fond care, 
Won't we love him, yes, love him, as dear 
as our life, 
So let us be loving, and kindness be showing, 
May Heaven protect him, and God bless our boy.

OUR DAILY BREAD. 
GEBMA.2i ItECITATION, BY HARRY LEAVITT. 
It YEW a 
lonely garret room, a 
poor mudder and 
her daughter lay, 
Tell, der vas not a 
morsel of food to eat„ nor - 
some fire by dot stove to-day. 
:Faint und sick kill de mudder poor, stretched 
out on a 
bed of pain; 
Her wrinkled eheeks and slender hands bespoke 
how long she'd lain. 
Fodder, give us die day our daily bread, is what 
dis little child would say, 
As she knelt beside dot tattered quilt and prayed 
for a 
loaf of bread that day. 
Brim full of faith, she started out to find herself 
de blace— 
; 
Where God did keep His baker shop to feed 
- 
der human race. 
" 
I've come for dot," said dis little shild; " I've 
come for dot daily bread; 
Und I 
vant me two of the largest loafs," to the 
baker man she said. 
" 
All right, all right," said de baker man; " HPre 
are two of the best I've got." 
Stop, come here, you little thief, de money I 
don't vos got." 
The tears rolling down her little cheeks, the 
little child then said; 
That God had said that He could give to all that 
ask this day some daily bread. 
I've Just come for dot daily bread dot He 
said dot He would give, 
c 
To take it home to my mudder dear, sboodth could 
at w 
oe 
live. 
De burly baker now felt pad of what de little 
shild had said; 
And then did fill her basket full of dot dey call 
our daily bread. 
'Una mit de speed of lightning quick, with those , 
little blessings on her head, , 
She told her mudder she found de blace where 
- -

THE WATERMILL 
AS RECITED BY G. LEAVITT, IN THE SKETCH, - 
" 
GOD BLEBS OUR BOY." 
Listen to the watermill, through the livelong day, 
How the clicking of its wheel wears the hours away, 
Languidly the autumn wind stirs the greenwood leaves; 
From the fields the reapers sing binding up the sheaves; 
And a 
proverb haunts my mind, as a 
spell is cast--. 
The mill will never grind with the water that is past. 
Autumn winds revive no more the leaves that 
once are shed, 
And the sickle cannot reap corn once gathered; 
And the rippling stream flows on, tranquil, deep 
sever gliding back again to the watermill. 
and still, 
Truly speaks the proverb old, with a 
meaning vast— 
'The mill will never grind with the water that is past. 
Take the lesson to thyself, loving heart and true; 
Golden years are fleeting by, youth is passing too; 
Learn to make the most of life, lose no happy day, 
Time will never bring thee back chances swept away; 
Leave no tender word unsaid love, while love shall last, 
The mill will never grind with the water that is past. 
Work while yet the daylight shines, man of 
strength and will, 
never does the streamlet glide unless by the mill; 
Wait not till to-morrow's sun beams upon the way, 
All that thou can'st call thine own lies in thy— to-day; 
Power, intellect, and health may not always last— 
The mill will never grind with the water that is past. 
Oh.! 
the wasted hours of life that have drifted by; 
Oh! the good we might have done, lost without a 
sigh 
Love that we might once have saved by a 
single word, 
Thoughts conceived, but never penned, perishing 
un heard. 
Take the proverb to thine heart, take and hold it fast— 
The mill will never grind with the water that is past. 
Oh! love thy God and fellow men, thyself consider last 
For come it will when thou must scan dark errors 
of the past.. 
And when the fight of life is o'er, and earth 
recedes from view, 
And Heaven in all its glory shines '
midst the 
pure, the good, the true— 
Then you'll see more clearly the proverb deep and vast--
The mill will never grind with the water that is past.

THE OLD BROWN PANTS. 
BY WALTER PMENIX. 
suzitt 13r H. LEAVITT. 
My grandfather, he at the age of eighty-three, 
One day he took a 
notion that he'd die; 
After he was dead, the will of course was read, 
By a 
lawyer, as we all stood by his side. 
Unto my brother Bill he left an old saw mil/, 
Unto my sister he bequested our grey mare; 
But when 'it came to me, the lawyer then said he, 
Why he left to you his old brown pants. 
CHORUS. 
How they giggled, how they yelled, 
Even my sister, dear Isabel, 
Gave me the laugh when e'er she got the chance, 
When grandpa only left to me his old brown pants. 
I 
thought it very thin, but still I 
took them in, 
And hung them on a 
nail beside the wall; 
My wife gave me the rub, and swore she'd tare 
them up, 
That she wouldn't have them in the house at all. 
But they bring back happy days that once have 
passed away, 
When a 
child upon his knee I 
used to prance; 
There is nothing half so dear, that I 
loved year 
after year, 
That I 
cherished like the old brown pants. 
Chorus. 
My brother Bill just to pass the hours away, 
In the river he thought he'd take a 
swim, 
When a 
stray goat showed its nose, and chewed 
up poor Bill's clothes, - 
It was summer and his garments they were thin. 
Now Bill he kicked and swore when he could 
not leave the shore 
I 
saw his situation at a 
glance, 
And then I 
let one yell, and says, oh! brother Bill, 
Don't you wish you had the old brown pants.

SENO, BY JOHNNY REESE. 
I'll take you home again, Kathleen, 
Across the ocean wild, 
To where your heart has ever been 
Since first you were my bonnie bride. 
The roses all have left your cheek, 
I've watched them fade away and die; 
Your voice is sad when e'er you speak, 
And tears bedim your loving eyes. 
CHOItIJS. 
I'll take you hack again, Kathleen, 
To where your heart will feel no pain, 
And when the fields are fresh and green, 
I'll take you to your home again. 
Totthat brisht home beyond the sea, 
liyiKathleen shall again return, 
And when the old friends welcome thee 
Thy loving heart will cease to yearn; 
Where laugh that little silvery stream, 
Beside your mother's humble cot, 
And brightest rays of sunshine gleam, 
Then all your grief will be forgot.

BILLY GOAT SONG. 
WRITTEN AND SUNG BY CHAS GLIDDEN. 
Oh ? once there lived a 
snoozer, 
And he owned a 
billy goat; 
ills skin was tough as leather, 
And shaggy was his coat. 
His head was nickel plated, 
And his teeth were like a 
file; 
He'd catch you on the fly, 
And he'd raise you half a 
mile. 
He bucked a 
Chinaman over a 
fence, 
And broke a 
nigger's back; 
Be stopped a 
one horse street car, 
.
7, 
And he bucked it off the track. 
He bucked a 
policeman over a 
house, 
That took him for a 
fool; 
He bit a 
yellow dog in two, 
And paralysed a 
mule. 
Be bucked a 
canal boat over a 
bridge, 
•• And split a 
one horse dray, 
He bucked an organ grinder 
Clean through a 
load of hay. 
He bucked a 
brass band up the street, 
And the people held their breath, 
When he backed up to a 
big stone wall. 
And bucked himself to death.

I

Beside the stream that murmurs soft and low, 
In the nook we've known since childhood, Eesie dear 
Where the sunbeams o'er the ripples come and go. 
Overhead the birds are singing in the tree, 
Their joyous carols echo through the dell, 
Where the violets are smiling in the breeze, 
Then our happy, happy tales of love we tell.

Down where we've roamed in merry days lang syne 
I

And I

For I

GUESS WHAT IT IS ? 
WRITTEN AND SUNG BY HARRY LLOYD. 
My friends I'm in trouble, 
Why I 
soon will tell; 
Because I 
dress up stylishly, 
Anti try to cut a 
swell. 
There's a 
gang upon the corner, 
Who when o'er I 
pass them "oy, 
Call me by a 
pet name, 
Guess what it is they cry. 
CHORUS. 
What is it, guess ? what is it, guess? 
! 
kill it with a 
stick, 
Strike it with a 
tomato. 
Or hit it with a 
brick. 
Oh ! tell me is it alive, 
Oh ! stab it with a 
pickle; 
Squash it with a 
rotten egg, 
Or brain it with a 
nickle. 
Last night I 
went out walking, 
Down O'Donavan street; 
Just as I 
turned the corner, 
I 
there the gang did meet. 
They hallowed ain't he a 
baby ? 
Stag his giblet's gall; 
Pipe his jackets, get on to his socks, 
He's just come from a 
ball.

REGAN'S PARTY. 
Old Regan he felt lively for a 
time, 
And a 
happier man I 
don't think could be found, 
He told us that the house was ours, to do just as 
we liked, 
So then we had a 
drink of bear all round, 
Cimans. 
! 
such singing, and such dancing lion my 
word twits really grand, 
And the music sounded just as well as if it was a 
band, 
While Murphy played the fiddle, they danced 
up and down the middle, 
And we never left old Regan till the morn. 
There was Mary Jones and Jerry Flynn got up 
to dance a 
jig,. 
Along with Michael Cronin's wife, who looked 
like Murphy's pig, 
The floor they welted beautiful, and went round 
hand in hand, 
But Cronin's wife she danced so much that she 
could hardly stand,. 
Then James O'Brien he got up to sing a 
song, 
But they did not seem to relish it one bit, 
They yanked him out so gently that he thought 
his time had come, 
And the poor old fellow fell into a 
fit. 
Chorus. 
They danced away till broad daylight, the sun 
broke in the sky, 
But McCarthy's wife was g0 fatigued. she thought 
ahe'd really die, 
M'Grtinness got overpowered on wine and lager beer, 
He felt so good he tried to do a 
pirouette on his ear, 
And poor old Jerry Dolan was found sleeping 
With a 
vice like grip upOn a 
china cup, 
And when they danced the last quadrille the 
fiddler fell asleep. 
And that's what wound old Regan's party up.

THE PATTER OF THE SHINGLEr 
RECITED BY JOE HART. 
When the angry passion gathering 
In my mother's face I 
see; 
And she leads me to the bed-chamber;. 
Gently lays me on her knee. 
Then I 
know that I 
will catch it, 
And myfiesh in fancy itches, 
As I 
listen to the patter 
Of the shingle on my breeches. 
Every tinkle of the shingle, 
Has an echo and a 
sting, 
And a 
thousand burning fancies 
Into active being spring. 
And a 
thousand bees and hornets, 
Beneath my coat-tail seem to SV76.21114 
And 1 
feel the patter 
Of the shingle, oh! so warm. 
In a 
sudden intermision, 
Which appears my only chance, 
I 
say strike gently, mother, 
Or you'll split my Sunday panls. 
She stops a 
moment, draws her breath. 
The shingle holds aloft, 
And says, I 
had not thought of that, 
My son just take them breeches off. 
Holy Moses and the angels, 
Cast your pittying glances down, 
And you, good family doctor, 
Put a 
good soft poultice on. 
And may I 
with fools and dunces 
Everlastingly mingle, 
if I 
ever say another word, 
When my mother wields the shingle.

I 
am going to sing a 
funny song, 
And the subject is not very long, 
It's all about the funny sights, 
On the lake shore on a 
Sunday night, 
Such droves of people I 
declare. 
From five till ten, are walking there,. 
All other streets deserted quite, • 
For the Lake Shore on a 
Sunday night. 
Cnonus. 
Oh! if you doubt then what I 
say, 
Go yourself most any day, 
Go yourself and see the sights, 
On the lake shore on Sunday night. 
There are bachelors gay sporting away, 
Laughing and talking with maidens gay, 
And old maids you will often find 
With little poodle dogs behind, 
Oh! don't they one another squeeze, 
It's when they feel the evening breeze, 
If the stars could speak tell tales they might, 
Of Lake View Park on Sunday night. 
Chorus. 
I'll tell you what me most annoys, 
it is to see so many naughty boys, 
Running around with common cigars, 
Wheff7they should be home with their 
pa's and masto 
And young girls scarce sixteen years old, 
Running around them so bold, 
An:1 doing things that isn't right, 
On the Lake Shore on Sunday night,

Young widows tired of single life, 
Wishing to become again a 
wife, 
Are trying with many a 
wicked leer, 
To catch a 
stylish husband dear. 
And gay young sports a 
strolling along, 
Singing " Maggie Gordon" or some love song. 
With sweethearts under their arm so tight, 
On the Lake Shore on Sunda: night.

AT THE BOARD OF EXAMINERS FOR PRIZE DECLAMATIONS, 
-MISS AMELIA. DEAN, WAS AWARDED THE FIRST PRIZE OF 
$100,00 SO11 THE RECITATION OF THE FOLLOWING. 
We laid in a 
cold cell Mr. Judge, all night long, 
Jimmie and me, waitin' and wishin' for the 
morning's dawn, 
Cause we couldn't sleep, Mister Judge, in 
that cold damp place. 
And Jimmie was most scared to death, by the 
wild, mad race 
That the rats kept runnin' all through the:dark night; 
That's why we're glad, Mr. Judge, to see the daylight. 
Please, Mr. Judge, we are not very bad little beys, 
And the policeman what took us said we're 
some mother's joys, 
He was wrong, Mr. Judge, and should only have said 
That we are two little outcasts, and our mother is dead, 
--And there's no one to care for us, at least here below. 
And no roof that shelters us from the rain and 
the snow. 
A preacher once told us that way up in the blue, 
-There was a 
God that was watching all that 
little boys dcy: 
And that He loved little children, and His love 
was free; 
But I 
guess, Mr. Judge, He don't love Jimmie or me; 
For I 
prayed, and I 
prayed till I 
was most out 
of breath, 
For something to eat, and to keep Jimmie Emu death. 
And that's why we're here, Mister Judge; for 
you know, 
There was no help from above, I 
must find it below; 
'Twas no use beggin' and be told in God I 
must trust. 
For I'd begged all the day and got never a 
crust; 
And there was pc or Jhunlie, bohlin' his 
cold little feet, 
And cryin' and moanin' for soniethin to eat. 
So I 
went to a 
house that was not very far, 
And saw, Mr. Judge, that the back door was ajar: 
And a 
table was satin' right close to the door, 
Just loaded with pies, about twenty or more. 
So quickly I 
slipped in and grabbed one to my breast,— 
The policeman then caught us, and you know the rest. 
Discharged, did you say, Mister Judge ? 
both Jimmie and I 
And—we ain't got to be jailed 'cause I 
took a 
pie ? 
And we can eat what we want?—how funny twill seam= 
Say,-Jimrnie, pinch ine, for I I 
think it's a 
dream, 
And you'll give us work, summer, winter and fall— 
Bay, Jimmie 1

think there's a

Sweetly in the twilight dancing, 
Fairy-like with form entrancing, 
Cunning elf with mischief glancing, 
Little roguish eyes; 
O'er the dew with lightness creeping, 
While the glow-worni soft is sleeping, 
And the bright stars forth are peeping, 
Peeping with surprise. 
As she wanders through the dell, 
Hushed is every birdie's song, 
For each songster knows full well, 
She rules the warbling throng. 
Brighter seems the day declining, 
As with sunlight still combining, 
Where her gleam o'er all is shining, 
Little roguish eyes. 
(Dame? 
Blithely in the eariy morning, 
Summer (14.1y is gently dawning, 
Lifting nights be-darkened awning, 
Little roguish eyes; 
As she wades the brooklet flowing, 
Moves amid the violets growing, 
Not a 
thought on one besiow,hg, 
Which around her lies. 
May her future life be pure, 
May her sweetness never fade, 
May grim sorrow ne'er secare, 
My own dear mountain maid. 
Joy o'er all my darling flinging, 
Hear the lark her praises singing, 
For to all sweet mirth she's bringing. 
Little roguish eyas.

Sure I 
thought I'd make a 
call, 
So I 
am here to greet you all, 
And to thank ye for yere welcome to a 
stranger; 
I 
got a 
job of work, 
Since I 
landed in New York, 
But my work is attended with great danger, 
For a 
mason's clerk am I, 
One whose always climbing high, 
And the hod and ladder is my occupation; 
But for politics I'm bound, 
And I'm bound to get around, 
To assist in making laws for this great nation.

Paddy Duffy is my name,

Whether rich or poor, of high or low degree;

Of a 
self-made, high-toned gentleman, you see! 
(Dance.) 
One day while on the ladder, 
Oh! I 
never yet got madder, 
Then I 
did upon that very same occasion; 
Some bricks fell from my hod, 
And lit upon the nob 
Of a 
German peddlar of the Jew persuasion; 
Sheeney-caIled hard names to Pat, 
For the bricks had broke his hat; 
I 
was angry, and the truth I 
had to tell, 
Oh! sez I, you dirty Jew,

DO ACTORS EVER EAT. 
UCITATioN BY TOM MARTIN, OF CROSBY & BIARTIX• 
COPYRIGHT, 1881 BY WM. J. A. Imr,DEB. 
ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. 
It is strange, yes, very strange, 
How by-words get about, 
You are sure to hear a 
new one, 
Each day that you go out. 
But the latest one that I 
have heard 
From a 
friend I 
chanced to meet, 
As she shook me by the hand and said—. 
Do actors ever eat?. 
At this remark my blood turned cold, 
I 
knew not what to do; 
I 
thought of good old days gone by, 
And of actors that I 
knew. 
I 
answered his conundrum, 
As if on the point of death, 
And told him that I 
always thought, 
That every actor eat. 
It is true they don't eat turkey, 
Or tackle chicken pie; 
But over a 
plate of boarding-house hash, 
I 
have seen an actor die. 
I 
have seen them chew the hinges off 
An old sole leather trunk, 
And fancy it was beef steak, 
Or the ear of Barnum's monk. 
I 
have watched them eat red herring, 
Until their gums were sore; 
And when the dish was empty, 
They would quietly kick for more. 
But when that dry of reckoning comes. 
And above we all shall meet, 
I'll bet my old suspenders, 
That here's two that always eat.

Come my daisy. and

CHORUS.

So that we will get cooled off,

Coller her right by the curl; 
Don't stand fooling, but 
Kick her in the eye.

We are two gilly's, 
And we come from

Km thinking of the day when but a

I 
wandered o'er the meadows to the hill, 
Where the sweet flowers grew, and forever 
growing will, 
And the stream e'er flowed by the mill. 
But the old mill house has gone to decay, 
I 
loved it and so did darling Kate, 
And the miller he lies sleeping where the 
gentle breezes blow' 
And we played 'neath the turnpike gate. 
CHORUS. 
For the turnpike gate is the pride of my heart, 
I 
loved it and so did darling Kate, 
When she sits beside me now, there's a 
smile 
upon her brow, 
That reminds me of the turnpike gate. 
And the old school house has gone to decay, 
Where the schoolmaster heard us recite, 
And those happy, happy days have faded 
from our vim% 
When our little hearts were filled with delight 
And when school was out we would wander to 
the spring 
Where I 
drew for you pictures on your slate; 
And those happy childhood days they'll come 
again no morel, 
When we played on the tarnpike gate.

COPYRIGHT 1881, BY wk. 3. A. LIEDER. 
ALL RIGHTS RES,RVED. 
Some people they grumble the dtv in and out. 
Over very small trifles of life. 
But I 
think I've the right to tell ye i 
about 
My darling, but talkative wife 
A 
day cannot pass but I 
get a 
new ntme, 
You numbskull, you fool, dunce, and such, 
For me to talk thus you might say tis a 
shame, 
but really, my wife talks too mucl, 
CRoRuS. 
Now John, come and kiss me, oh! dohave a 
care, 
One'd think you were kissing a 
mule 
Why John, yonv'e been drinking to-day I 
declare! 
You're leading the life of a 
fool, 
Before we were married, you promised ycli 
We'd lead a 
most happy gay life; 
But since we are married I 
find 'tisn't so, 
I'm only your talkative wife. 
One evening while kissing she said have a 
cart; 
One'd think you were kissing a 
mule, 
I 
said as a 
joke, I 
just kissed one, my dear, 
I 
know not that I 
was a 
fool. 
She scratched me, she pinched me, she wept and she said 
You're mean, you're a 
brute, so you are, 
And she cried as she tore some nice locks from my he&d, 
I'm going right back to my ma. 
Chorus. 
Now here at election I 
bet a 
new hat, 
Of course 'twas a 
very small cost, 
But she keeps saying why did yon do that? 
Why bet on the men that have lost. 
There's Jenkins next door, whose as cute as a 
horse, 
Has several new suits while you've none; 
Now when did he get them, he won them' of course, 
By betting on those that have won. 
Chorus. 
I 
thought I'd find peace in the club room at night, 
I 
went there one evening to test, 
Oh! then I 
found peace, yes, and then I 
got tight, 
And came home, I 
shant tell the rest. 
One thing I 
will say, though, to all you young men, 
When married, oh! guard against strife; 
If you don't you will wish you we 
single again, 
That's if you've a 
talkative wife. 
Chorus 
BOLIVAR BILL 
AS SUNG BY B. C. HART. 
Bolivar Bill was a 
pea-nut man, 
And he'd a 
lovely daughter; 
Her eyes they looked like oyster shells-, 
And her nose was as flat as a 
quarter.. 
She was graceful as a 
cord of wood, 
Her feet was filled with bunions, 
Her mouth was like the Maumee river 
Her breath was sweet as onions. 
CHORUS. 
Ta, ta, ta, ta, my baby dear, 
I'll meet you in the park, if you'll treat to lager beer, 
Now don't you think you see that you are rather queer, 
I 
think the best thing you can do, is 
Waltz off on your ear. 
When dressed up in the latest style, 
We looked just like a 
clothes rack; 
With a 
horse's tail fnr a 
waterfall, 
And a 
dish-rag for a 
pin-back. 
With government shoes about nineteen, 
And a 
brick bat for a 
locket; 
A 
tin pan for a 
diamond ring, 
And a 
ham bone in her pocket. 
Chorus. 
She fell in love with a 
nice young man, 
And she tried his heart to slaughtei; 
His hair was green, his teeth was loose, 
And he peddles chalk and water. 
His nose looked like a 
big mushmelon, 
Puffed out from drinkinv booze; 
His feet looked like two salted hams. 
And his name was Over Shoes. 
Spoken.—Yes, and when he'd go up on Sundays to 
to see her, and she'd shake him, he used to say— 
CHORUS. 
Ta, ta, ta, ta, my lady dear, I'll meet you in the Park 
If you'll treat to lager beer, 
I'll fill you up with white clam shells, 
And I'll get you drunk on booze; 
The snide of all the ladies is Peaster Overshoes.

She has a

And her features they were fair, 
Her lips were like the roses, 
And coal black was her hair. 
Cuories. 
For they all did say she was so mighty gay, (Bret...k.) 
There was many a 
lovely creature who made 
the people stare, (Break.) 
But the lovely one among them all, 
Was the girl with the coal black hair. 
When the ball was over, 
In the carriage we did hop, 
And as we drove along the streets, 
The question I 
did pop. 
She said, go way, you nigger, 
How dare you ask me, 
For I'm a 
female buffer, 
And colored aristocrat.

By my dress you can see I'm a 
true son of Mars; 
Tho' for fighting and blood-shed I'm not much carein,g. 
I'll show no white feather if sent to the wars. 
But I'll fight with comrades protecting the banner, 
Beloved by all subjects that's loyal and true;

Chorus. 
To the bugle's shrill notes I've obeyed like a 
soldipr, 
When hungers sharp thorns in my bosom were deep; 
When darkness our forms has shielded from danger, 
The roar of the cannon has lulled me to sleep. 
At the close of the fight with the moon as our guardian, 
When peace was proclaimed '
neath the bright 
shining stars; 
,Our commanders stern voiccs were heard loudly calling 
God bless you, my bold gallant Irish Ihizz,rs.

We danced the schottische, hands all round, 
And balance down the middle, 
The boys and girls they all kept time, 
To Casey's eight day fiddle. 
At twelve o'clock the gentlemen, 
Took partners one and all, 
To enjoy a

I'm writing home to mother, 
To the old home far away; 
Where I 
roamed in early childhood, 
When my heart was blithe and gay. 
In my dreams at night I 
see her, 
Standing by the mossy well; 
How I 
love that dear old homestead, 
There's no tongue on earth can tell. 
CHORUS. 
Yes, I'm writing home to mother, 
To the old home far away; 
Where the robia and the blue-bird, 
Sang so sweet their morning lay. 
I 
am writing home to mother, 
To the old home far from here; 
For on earth there is no other place 
To me so near and dear. 
In the grave-yard 'neath the willows, 
Stands poor father's lonely tomb, 
And the night winds whisper softly, 
O'er his grave where flowers bloom.

THE BLUE ALSATIAN MOUNTAINS 
EX CLARA_BELL. 
MUSIC BY STEPHEN ADAMS. 
By the blue Alsatian mountains, 
Dwelt a 
maiden young and fair; 
Like the careless flowing fountains 
Were the ripples of her hair. 
Were the ripples of her hair; 
Angel mild, Ler eyes so winning, 
Ingel bright her happy smile, 
When beneath the fountain spinning, 
A-de, A.-de, Ade, 
Such songs will pass away; 
Tho' the blue Alsatian mountains, 
Seem to watch and wait alway! 
.By the blue Alsatian mountains, 
Many spring-times bloomed and passed. 
And the maiden by the fountains, 
Saw she lost her hopes at last, 
She lost her hopes at last. 
And she withered like a 
flower, 
what is waiting for the rain; 
She will never see the stranger, 
Where the fountains fall again. 
A-de, A-de, A-de, 
The years have passed away, 
But the blue .-4iian mountains 
_Ever watch and wait away, 
A-de, A-do, A-do. 
'The years have passed away, 
But the blue Alsatian mountains, 
;Seem to watch and 7 Ait alway. 
By the blue Alsatia'r mountains, 
Came a 
strang- . the spring, 
And he lingerea Dy the fountains, 
Just to hear the maiden sing, 
dust to hear the maiden sing; 
Just to whisper in the moonlight, 
Words the sweetest she had known, 
Just to charm away the hours, 
Till her heart was all his own. 
A-de, A-de, A-de, 
such dreams must pass away, 
.But the blue Alsatian mountains. 
eeem ,to watch and wait alway.
