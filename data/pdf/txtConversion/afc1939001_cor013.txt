[Letter from John A. Lomax to Harold Spivacke]
Port Aransas, Texas, 2/23/1939
My dear Mr. Spivacke:
Perhaps your predecessor has a right to complain at me for my failure to write more
explicitly about my schedule on the collecting trips. Be that is [sic] it may, I should like you
to have concrete evidence that I am preparing my engagements ahead of time. See the
enclosed letters already received. At least glance through them and return them to me
here . Some of the details may come in handy. I hope that the machine, also, will come
along during the first half of March. I will be ready to hit the trail by March 15 at the latest.
When you write again send me Alan's latest address. My last letter to him has been
returned marked “Gone. Left no address.”
I trust that everything goes well with you in your work and that you take time to enjoy your
pretty home and also your lovely lady.
Sincerely your friend, John A. Lomax
I am yet looking for suggestions from you.
