TAPE BEGINS WITH INFORMANT IN MID-SENTENCE:
There's (--)  Let's see what is the best way?  Uh, there is some, there is some good old stores that 
use to be here that are not here anymore.  And I know there is a lot of concern that "hey we have 
all this revitalization, but what happened to all these old stores?"  But considering, if you look at 
any other downtown, this is a nationwide problem that stores that were based on foot traffic in 
automobile age have a real hard time making it.  And what we are doing here hasn't been enough 
to completing change, or reverse that tide.  I mean there is an enormous shopping mall that has 
opened within the last ten years a few miles from here.  So that people who are mobile and can 
go anywhere finally are going to go to those kinds of big malls.  What uh, you have left are 
people who don't have cars, who are much more of a captive population.  And it depends on 
whether or not the stores understand who they are and know how to market to them and right 
now, again this reminds me a lot of another place I worked at before.  Uh, a lot of times 
merchants have a very funny idea of who is out there.  They see old people around, so they say 
nobody lives here but old people.  Well people, the older people are only coming there because 
other people don't have anything to shop for there.  So it becomes a self-perpetuating thing.  Uh, 
the, I think the stores have been real reluctant to market to high school students.  They are afraid 
of them, and they are nervous about them.  These are the people that have more money to spend 
and spend it.  Uh, and the other big group that I think the store owners are not picking how many
professional people, uh, and service people are working within walking distance of the 
downtown for lunch hour shopping.  And they are just not being catered to.  And if they were I 
think their retailing would be more active.  Uh, but it still, it is not doing that bad.  What you are 
seeing are changes from (--)  I mean just as an example, from a dress shop to a rental service 
kind of appliance store.  Uh, there are still plenty of people around, and they are doing errands 
here.  And that sort of thing.  They may not being doing there huge wardrobe shopping, but they 
are doing more impulse shopping. 
S:  The thing that I like about Lowell is it still has a Five and Ten on Main Street.  And the Five 
and Ten has stayed, the building has been renovated around it.  They actually did a beautiful 
renovation of the inside.  But it is still a Five and Ten.  It hasn't turned into some fancy gift shop, 
or whatever, and I think that is great.  Uh, I like that you can still get your shoes fixed here, that 
you can still get your film developed, that sort of thing.  But it is kind of a soar spot.  I mean I 
won't deny it.  
I:  So when it comes to certain kinds of things (--)  Now that Five and Ten on Main Street is sort 
of an interesting, you know, distinctive feature of place that gives kind of a character on Main 
Street in Lowell, are their things as you as a planner can do to try to, uh, make it, encourage that 
as an aspect of Lowell?
S:  Uh, you can to a certain degree.  Uh, there is a lot you can't do.  I mean I think you have to 
remind yourself that just because you have an overview doesn't mean you can control everything.
And uh, some of the most successful stuff that has been done in other communities and it is 
happening here also, is there is a national Main Street program.  The idea of getting merchants 
together and sponsor special promotional things and give out balloons and so forth and it does 
work.  [I:  Only people who are merchants on streets named Main Street, or could it be Bride 
Street, or something?]  No, no, it just means what you, you identify what's your Main Street.  [I:  
In your town.]  Right.  [I:  So where is that program based?]  There is a guy named Henry 
Marchand, who is out of the Lowell Plan Office.  That was actually started by the National Trust,
by somebody I know.  It was just a real good idea.  She is a planner.  [I:  Who is the person in the
Trust?]  Her name is Mary Neives.  [O:  On Halloween when they had the children Halloween 
Parade, they all got together on Middle Street and were awarding prices.]  Yeah.  That kind of 
thing.  [O:  And the announcer was saying things like "don't you like downtown?!  Are you going
to come back downtown for Christmas?"]  That is right.  That's right.  That's right.  [O:  I thought
that was interesting.]  Well it is true, I mean the Main Street program has some games and 
puzzles and things that I wanted to try them out.  So I tried them on my five year old just to see if
he was interested in this.  I was kind of curious.  Well this kid is going crazy now, begging me so 
I can take him downtown so he can look (--)  It is puzzles with buildings and he is identifying 
buildings.  I had him downtown in the town I live in that has a very similar Main Street to 
Lowell on a little smaller scale, and all of a sudden he jumps out of the car and starts going 
"Mom, mom, mom"!  And I thought there was a fire or something.  And he goes, "Second 
Empire, Second Empire, look at that."  You know.  And the same way.  He has driven down 
Merrimack Street here a thousand times on our way to various things here, and the last time I 
brought him here he was jumping up and down looking at the buildings all of a sudden.  [I:  That 
is good.]  And that comes out of the Main Street Program.  So, uh, (--)  [I:  The jigsaw puzzle?]  
Yeah.  Or somebody got the idea.  It is called Main Street.  It is in the book store here.  [O:  
Okay, uh, the commission just has been reauthorized.]  Yes.  [O:  UNCLEAR]  Were you there at 
the press conference when they asked the city manager what the goals were, I mean the Mayor 
what the goals were for the next seven years and what the vision (--)  He kept talking about the 
Canal Way Vision, and finally a reporter said, "what is the Canal Way Vision?"  And he sort of 
went "uh, uh, uh, uh."  [I:  It is a Tunnel Vision only wetter.]  [LAUGHING]  Well I think I 
started using the term "The Canal Way Vision" so you can blame it on me.  [LAUGHING]  
S:  Our first goal though, Chuck Parrot, our Historical Architect and I, who I will say cooked up 
this whole Canal Way idea with a couple of other people, uh, we said our first goal is that we got 
to get it a little clearer across to people what the Canal Way Vision is for starters.  That is one 
goal.  In terms of, well I will say there was a time when there were probably three people who 
felt that the commission should continue, I was one of them.  The conventional wisdom here was
that it was a big deal to have set up ten year program and to be able to say that we have 
accomplished what we were going to do, which was true.  And everybody was afraid that if we 
went for more time it would look like we hadn't been able to finish our work in time.  And that 
there was a lot to be said for being able to wind up.  There was a lot of pride attached to that.  
That we said we would do it we did it.  That was true, but I didn't think that the necessary 
conclusion to that was then therefore you should go away.  Uh, this started from doing an 
analysis of what hadn't been done.  Okay, we recognized along the canals that we have all been, 
when I say we is something that came to be the Canal Way Force Task Force, but it was all these 
various planning and development groups in town.  The Lowell Plan, the city and the state, and 
all the various parties that had been working downtown.  And we realized that we had been 
working on cites, individual cites, real hard for the last three or four or five years.  And we had 
forgotten the fact that the Canal system, the whole point of it, is that it connected and that it is 
suppose to be a loop, and it is suppose to be a series of experiences.  In other words it is suppose 
to be a linear park.  And we were working on the individual cites, but they were not connected 
very well.  Uh, and we had sort of lost the big picture.  So we were looking (--) I mean this really
came up with we knew we should be something more along the canals and we asked for a bunch 
of money and we didn't really define what it was going to be for and we were saying how should 
we be spending this money?  Where are the most important things?  And we went back to the 
brown book and we were looking through it, "What hasn't been done?  What are the most 
important priorities?"  And it was this whole idea of connecting things, and making continued 
route was very important.  Well when you start looking at what has to be done to create a linear 
park and then you start saying okay, who, uh, can best do it and the conclusion we got was this is
why they came up with the commission idea in the first place.  Because there was nobody to do 
it.  You are looking for amenity that is interested in both the physical and the cultural 
environment.  In other words, it is not just going to build thing, but it is going to work on 
programs and help out [UNCLEAR] Uh, that can work with the private sector.  A lot of it is 
going to be property that you do not own, that has a grant making capacity maybe, that has a 
construction capacity, that has a knowledge of the history, and what's appropriate and what is 
going on.  
S:  And it was so similar to what we were doing that that is what the reason was for coming up 
with the idea of extending the commission in the first place.  But in terms of specific goals I 
think uh, that we would like to get the inner and the outer way of the Canal functioning as linear 
parks.  Uh, we would like to emphasize the cultural programs and the programatic components 
of what is going on here as much if not more of the physical components.  It's time.  Uh, and I 
think that we really want to be there uh, to be responsive to other things that come up, that are 
appropriate, I mean like to folklife.  A project which we haven't really envisioned exactly the way
it is turning out, but because we were there with a group of people who had some knowledge and
knew how to recognize a good idea when they saw it and has the ties within the community and 
also with the broader world who knew how to make things happen, were there for future things 
that maybe coming up.  I mean I can see a variety of things that are just in the early stages of 
being talked about.  The Art Center in the old Federal Building, uh, there could be after school 
programs and more activity oriented kinds of things.  Uh, Boarding House Park is going to be an 
outdoor performance, well it is a place ,ut what is going to go on there, a lot of the programs 
through the cultural center that we could be of assistance and getting going.  Uh, a whole variety 
of things.  I am sure there are plenty of (--)  We got the frame work.  I am sure there are ideas 
that I have not thought of yet.  I mean that is the whole point.
I:  How do you see the Folklife Project, uh, I mean are there any examples of how information of
the sort gathered by the Folklife Project could be helpful in planning?
S:  Oh, yeah.  Uh, I think often (--) Well for one thing, it is very interesting to me and if the 
reports are in a form, or the interviews are in a form that I can have access to them, and I am 
using myself as the generic planner, it may no be me personally, it maybe other people.  That it is
kind a way of testing back to make sure that what you are working on really makes sense.  Uh, I 
mean it is almost like another kind of data base, you know, it is easy to get census data and other 
kinds of data.  It is a lot harder to get the kind of information you are generating, but once it is 
there, I mean we do use a lot of historical documentation for, uh, determining what is 
appropriate.  So why not use more oral or current information.  I think one real question I will 
have is how accessible will it be.  One of the things that is really good about the Culture 
Resources, we call it that, which is the National Park Service's definition.  It is the inventory of 
buildings.  One of the reasons we use it so much is because it is very accessible.  [I:  Uh huh.]  
Uh, it's organized in a way that we know how to use it and it there.  It is easy, there is a 
numbering system, you can look up an address and quickly learn everything about a building.  I 
don't know how you organize your information.  [I:  See that is the question, maybe the way the 
folklore's says we organize it for each other would be different that the way that planners would 
find it most useful.  That is a question I have, you know.]  
O:  Well lets put it this way, can you [UNCLEAR]
S:  I think if you have some kind of (--) Well what I was going to say is in reading your 
Pilance(?) Report you had a whole lot of messages that you wanted to (--)  If the planners would 
only know this and if the planners would only know that.  Let us know what those things are.  If 
we have a sense that we are doing what people want and we are creating what people can enjoy, 
but if you here differently highlight those things.  Let us know.  I think that's the (--) Also it may 
be that we never get to read every single individual thing but if you can pull together an overall 
report and if there are some clear messages [I:  Uh huh.] uh, for the people who are shaping the 
physical environment, let us know.  Because we want to know about them.  If you can think of 
some ways that you can get that information back then we are open to it.  I think we have a very 
open planning atmosphere.  Uh, this is not done behind closed doors.  The people who are 
making decisions and determining things are very visible.  Everybody knows everybody.  And 
they are open to things.  There is also a huge amount of information.  A lot of thing flying 
around.  Uh, I don't know there is a whole other area that I am just very interested in myself and 
that is, [UNCLEAR] just the average person not understanding who their physical environment 
is shaped and that they can have an effect on it.  [I:  Uh hmm.]  And I think when people do 
understand and the more they understand about that the better.  And when they do understand 
what they can do, for example, something just doesn't get built across the street from you.  Uh, 
there is a real sense of frustration.  We get calls from on the phone, "There is some digging going
on my street."  You know?  "They're doing it."  Who is doing this.  Uh, the more people 
understand about how the process works and how to get into it the earlier the better and if you 
can give us some suggestions.  I mean one technique that we use a lot is just putting our 
guidelines and rules in handbooks.  And kind of a fun (--)  Have I shown you the sign book?  Uh,
it is one that we did signage and it is fun to read.  [I:  Uh huh.]  It has the standards and the rules 
which are pretty strict and are kind of hard to understand, but has a lot of fun illustrations.  It is 
just a nice thing to leaf through.  [I:  Uh huh.]  We, uh, commission that.  Had someone, a 
graduate student, do that.  And we published it, and we spread it around.  Lots of people use it 
because it is fun to read.  I mean that's one way I know to let people know how they can, uh, 
what they can do and what is expected.  [I:  Yeah.]  So that they can feel part of this.  Uh, when 
you get complicated development projects, it is harder.  Uh, I think if you asked most people 
around what's zoning(?)?  They wouldn't have the foggiest idea.  [I:  Uh huh.]  Uh, and it bothers 
me that a zoning public hearing is a formality.  Uh, they notify people, but, nobody comes, uh, 
whatever.  Unless the [UNCLEAR] are directly affected.  And if there are ways that people (--) I 
mean we set up the store regulations here so that anybody who cares (--)  Anybody who is a 
concerned party can speak at a public hearing.  And that is something that is really very unusual. 
All other Historic Commission in the state, you have to have standing.  Which means you have to
be financially affected, uh, in order to even allowed to speak at a hearing or in the (--)  Lets say if
the case was appealed [I:  Uh huh.] you could live down the street and be horrified at what was 
going on, and you would have no right to give testimony in court the way the State Historic 
Commission Law is set up.  While we set up something here that allows anybody who cares to 
have legal standing.  Uh, but who really knows that.  And it is things like that.  You know, people
have to understand that they can get into this and know how to do it.  Uh, and I don't necessarily 
know the way either.  I think by the way that the Lowell Sun is very helpful in that, because they 
report on these things and they do get it down to the, uh, language that people can understand.
O:  How with you Plan [UNCLEAR], going out beyond the Historic District, how do you read 
the landscaping, do you have any observations?
S:  Are you talking about the physical landscape, the human landscapes of each, I mean, what do 
you mean by landscape?
O:  Well, you take it by any way that you want to.
S:  Okay.  Cause that becomes kind of a loaded term.  Uh, according to my training I would be 
talking in terms of Physical landscape but that's, uh, my training also included a lot more on the 
job training than school training.  Uh, lets see, where would I start?  Well I agree with other 
people that you have spoken with in our office.  This is a fascinating place, at a fascinating time. 
I really think there is something, uh, about this community that makes it almost an ideal 
laboratory.  It's big enough to be urban and to be a real city but small enough so that you can 
understand what is going on, that you can (--)  There moods of the city that really are felt, uh, I 
mean word travels here so fast, uh, that it has the best ingredients of a small town, too.  Uh, I 
think that the new immigrants right now are probably the most exciting thing.  I think that has 
been the vitality, it is what saved this community over history.  It is hard at the beginning, I mean
this has always a city where there have been new comers and they have had a hard time.  There 
has been a lot of struggle and strength, but also a lot of energy.  And that that is happening again 
is pretty exciting.  Nobody knows how it is going to come out.  It is not all a rosy picture.  I mean
there is obviously a lot of hardship.  But contrary to what has been said in the Globe and some of
the popular press, uh, around, I don't really think that the revitalization efforts around here have 
displaced people.  I feel very strongly that that is not correct.  Uh, in other words, uh, almost 
every other successful revitilization of other cities around the country, have been taken low cost 
buildings, they have thrown somebody else out to put somebody else in.  And in this case, it is 
the mills that were just plain vacant.  Uh, we actually increased the supply of housing.  I think 
that is what attracted so many new immigrants as we increased the housing supply.  We have 
increased the job opportunities to go with it.  There is some ajustments that's going on right now. 
But public policies have not displaced people in the city and there is not many places that can say
that.  Now I think there is sort of a basic faith and good will here because of that.  People have 
not been thrown out because by Urban Renewal.  I am talking about in the last 10 years.  It is not
true before that, I mean when Little Canada was demolished.  And you see that that is the 
bitterness that connected with that is still very much alive.  And I think there is a basic trust in 
the leaders, or whatever right now because that hasn't happened.  When people see that (--) There
was an interview on TV I know last summer I think, with a Cambodian Family who lives in 
Market Mills, and they were talking about this place is so pretty.  And how nice it is here.  I mean
it was theirs.  Just the fact that the National Park Service is downstairs from a Housing Project, I 
mean nobody says it in those words but it is.  And if you think that wasn't controversial, uh, a lot 
of the National Park people were horrified of that idea.  Uh, (--)
O:  Let me attract this in here.  What I have heard comes from mainly this place, it is particularly 
in relationship to the Hispanic population, uh, [UNCLEAR] that they are being displaced.  Uh, I 
don't know, I haven't heard it related to specifically to the National Park [S:  Uh huh.]  Uh, (--)
S:  Is is more a question of rents have gone up and I can't afford to live in the same 
neighborhood, that sort of thing?  [O:  It seems to be two parts, the rents have gone up and can't 
afford to live, and also the landlords prefer Asians.]  Uh huh.  On the rents going up, I mean that 
is true, uh, but I guess what I would say is that job opportunity has also increased at least in the 
same proportion.  I mean the overall economy is growning and, uh, it seems to me, anyway, that 
there is always some individual cases and they are always cases where it may not be happening.  
They may have two curves going on and they may not be precisely matched.  In other words, one
might be going up a little faster than the other and I wouldn't disagree with that.  But it just 
seems that the job opportunities are there to make up the difference for that.  Not that it is 100% 
that it works in every case but in many cases they are there.  Now when they're difficulties either 
because of language, or other concerns, that may be where it breaks down.  The business about 
preferring one ethnic group over another, I am sure that is true.  And uh, I don't know, it is kind 
of hard to respond to.  Again, I don't know if that is something that a public policy can really 
affect that much except through possibly the school issues or whatever.  And I think that the 
same people who are affecting other areas of policy here are also real concerned about schools 
and they are looking at that.  I mean they are not just (--) There was a time when there was so 
much attention on physical development and only physical development.  And a lot of people 
will tell you  that what is going on here now is simply because the previous city manager just 
wasn't putting any money into schools or didn't want to think about them, didn't want to pay any 
attention to them.  Uh, because all he was interested in was downtown.  And that is just no longer
the case.  So I am sure what is going on now is (--) I mean there is a back log of that, or a back 
lash of that.  And uh, you know the problem just grew to the point where it bursted.  But it is 
also, (--)  I mean I talk to with a lot of people, some people after the elections, and they are 
feeling pretty good about themselves because it is like, "okay we through the bad guys out, you 
know, we know what we are doing and you know this is not a town that is run by a man on the 
street."  There is a real recognition that common sense counts.  People were saying "okay, well, 
you know, we didn't do so bad after all, you know, we are struggling on this, but we did the right 
thing finally."  You know, it is going to take a while and it is not all perfect, but, uh, it is not so 
bad either.  I mean when I look at some of the other cities in comparision in New Jersey or 
whatever that are going through similar things and the atmoshere.  It's pathable.  I mean you can 
walk down the street and feel it.  And, I mean there is frustration here, sure.  And individual 
families having the most serious kind of problems and I wouldn't pretend differently.  But there is
also a lot of optimism, and a lot of (--)  I think people can see opportunities right there across the 
street from them.  And they are moving up.  I mean, I think this is an open community in a lot of 
ways.  Uh, when you see the fancier neighborhoods and the changes in the ethnic groups and the 
populations that are moving through them.  I mean, it is pretty fluent.  I don't know.  I think some
people tend to be forward looking and optimistic and it may be genetic.  [LAUGHING]  There 
are other people who can only see, like one of the city councilers who always bottoms out the list
and always find the negative thing to say and always sees the worst.  There is obviously 
something for each.  
I:  You were saying I guess that Lowell was an example of an early planned city.  Do you see 
example of what you may consider to be [prenacular?] planning, you know, of certain areas or 
districts (--)
S:  But by [prenacular?] are you saying (--) [I:  You know, totally bottom up?]  Well the 
downtown, uh, the general (--) It ws planned in a sense that someone laid out the city 
geographically and said "these are the best cites for water power, and therefore the mills will be 
here."  We want to keep an eye on our workers and provide campus-like housing for them and 
that has to be near by, because there is no transportation, they have to walk back and forth a few 
times a day.  The housing will be here.  And then what is left will be the commercial area, but 
that commercial area developed on it's own.  [I:  Uh huh.]  Uh, and so did most of the 
neighborhoods, I mean they were not laid out as part of the original plan.  
I:  So if you has to plan, I mean does your preservational plan include any (--)  Would it be 
possible for a preservation plan to try to protect good quality or character of a neighborhood, you
know, by identifying some of the features or (--)
S:  No, a big chunk of the Acre is in our preservation district.  The earliest residential 
nieghborhood, and that by the way was not part of the plan city.  I mean it was the area left over. 
Uh, so it was, again, it was developed, the way it developed had to do with an earlier generation 
of developers and building speculators, I mean let's not kid ourselves.  [I:  Yeah, yeah.]  That's 
who, uh, laid these things out.  Uh, yeah, I think that the character of the buildings has a lot to do
with where they are, the size that they are, the detail that is left on them, and how they are used 
has a lot (--)  We don't really (--)  In our design review we do not get involved in use of 
buildings.  We have left to zoning.  Although, we have been involved in and have made some 
suggestions on zoning changes.  Uh, yeah I think that we can determine a lot about the physical 
character of the neighborhood.  But that is only one component.  I mean we have worked with 
the triangle, uh, urban renewal area in the Acre.  Our funds are being pulled with others in that 
whole area.  And we liked working (--)  I mean we really had a dilema, because the whole Acre 
is in our preservation district.  But we were not kidding ourself that throwing a bunch of 
preservation grants at buildings was going to change, or stabilize, or really do much of anything 
in the neighborhood.  So when that overall plan was being put together we were really glad, 
because it gave us a way to participate, uh, in someway that we can have some effect.  There 
were a bunch of buildings that ranked A, meaning Nationally Significant in our inventory, the 
first version of the plan.  Some of them were proposing to tear down because they thought that 
they were beyond repair, and we helped them to see that they were not beyond repair, and they 
agreed not to tear them down.  Uh, we identified (--)
END OF SIDE ONE
BEGINNING OF SIDE TWO
TAPE BEGINS WITH INTERVIEWER:  They are starting to document a drug deal.
S:  Yeah, uh, our auditors(?) were checking to see (--)  They were spot checking our grant 
program to see whether in fact that all these things in the file had really happened and we told 
them about that these four buildings that had been renovated and we were just too busy to go 
with them that day.  So we gave them the addresses and the before pictures and the historic 
inventory and sent them off.  Well these guys went off with their little cameras, and looking very 
fed-like with their white shirts, and their black pants, and their leather shoes.  And of course I 
wasn't there, so this is second hand, but they were photographing what turned out to be a drug 
dealing process, and a really hostile neighborhood, contention started gathering around them.  
And they were scared to death.  I mean this is a half a block from the National Park Visitors 
Center and whatever, and we are real concerned about it.  Uh, they are taking exceptions to why 
should we be spending preservation funds in an area like this?  Well, hey, it is in our district, it's 
in the area that congress designated, it has great historical significance.  Uh, but we can't control 
everything.  And, uh, I don't know how they are going to report it in their audit report.  
Personally, we felt sorry for them.  Uh, but it is a fact of life.  I mean that is what's going on 
there.  And uh, what can you say?
O:  We have similar experiences, you have probably have heard.
S:  No, I didn't.  No.  In the same house?
O:  No, in the North Common Housing Project, uh, there are a few of us that were invited to the 
roof of the housing project director, he wanted to take some photographs.  And uh, he was up 
there with his camera and one of the reasons that the director wanted him to go up there was so 
that he would have an opportunity to see all the hypodermic needles on the roof.  In that project 
there happens to be drug paraphernalia.  [S:  Yeah.]  Uh, while they were up there they witnessed
a mugging.  Uh, two guys going after somebody else with a lengthy pipe.  [I:  On the roof or on 
the streets?]  They were on the roof, and they observed from the roof, uh, this mugging going on 
down in the house.  So the director of the project dashed down and let himself into an apartment 
to call the police.  The police arrived promptly on the scene and grabbed the guys in the process 
of all of this and then proceeded questioning people on the scene.  And there was our field 
worker there with his camera, uh, and they wanted him to come down to police headquarters.  
He, at that point said to them "look I am not here (--) I am here with the Library of Congress, I 
am here to document, but I don't want to be seen with you.  I don't want to be associated with
