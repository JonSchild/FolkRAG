Mr. Alan Lomax Library of Congress Washington, D. C.
My Dear Mr. Lomax:
I am very happy to know that there is a prospect that you may come to be with us during
our Folk Festival on March 6th. Let me remind you that we plan a secular program for
the evening of March 6th, with the sacred program on March 9th. It will be possible for
you to record continuously throughout the festival, and we should be overjoyed to have
you do so. I am writing to the other persons whom you mention, and we should also be
very happy to have your father come. W. C. Handy will be here, and we expect other
celebrities.
With much gratitude to you, I am
Sincerely yours, H. M. Bond H. M. Bond, President.
