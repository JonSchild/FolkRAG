Summary of  Interview / Event: 
Brian Sapp, Director of Livestock at White Oak Pastures discusses the meat industry, meat economics, daily 
work ‘on the line’ and how to create a workplace where the the physical work of processing livestock results 
in high quality meat and employee health and retention. He shares his personal background as a Floridian and 
as child on a family-caladium farm, describing how he learned about the meat industry through a work-study 
job on his University of Florida campus. Brian describes the process of building White Oak Pastures’ on-
farm red and white meat abattoirs and his hopes for the future of the business, which include preparing a 
“further-processing” facility to create ready-to-eats such as deli meats as well as an on-farm tannery. He 
reflects on the reasons why the specific work style of WOP employees has meant high employee retention in 
an industry that sees 100% annual turnover.  
Interview Log: 
Introduction: Brian Gary Sapp was born in Avon Park, FL, March 25, 1983. His job title is Director of 
Operations at White Oak Pastures (WOP). Brian’s primary focus: the meat processing side of the business—
running the red meat and poultry abattoirs and day-to-day facilitation of the processing. Brian works with all 
the company managers in the field for raising livestock, for special projects, lining up audits for the USDA, 
and serving on the board of directors for various associations and as well as some government boards. 
0 01 35 Brian describes what meat processing entails and introduces himself. Meat processing is the whole 
process from procurement of the animals to sales: dealing with the farmers, getting audits for the farm’s 
producer groups, overseeing the slaughter operation, producing finished steaks or ground beef, and then 
shipping the final product.  
Brian describes how and why he was hired by WOP to run its red meat plant in May 2008, soon after he 
graduated from the University of Florida.  
0 02 50 When Brian started, WOP was in the construction phase of its red meat abattoir, which was 90 
percent finished. Within a month, the farm had acquired equipment, hired employees, and processed its first 
head of cattle.  
0 03 42 Brian continues: WOP is a distinctive facility that was designed by a Kansas firm [run by Temple 
Grandin who is renowned for overhauling the US meat industry through introduction of humane livestock 
animal slaughter facilities] that specializes in facilities of 5,000 to 6,000 square feet, enough room to slaughter 
and process 50 head of cattle a week. But during the farm’s first two years—and without adding square 
footage—he oversaw minor adjustments to make the facility more productive and efficient. With those 
changes, WOP was able to process about 130 to 140 head a week giving WOP more market share and 
solidifying its position as primary southeastern US regional meat source for thousands of Americans. 
0 04 54 Prior to joining WOP, Brian raised farm animals at his family farm for 4H and FFA [Future Farmers 
of America]. He didn’t come from a meat background His meat background started at the meat processing 
facility at the University of Florida, specifically in their “Meat Lab,” where he worked part time, mostly in 
“clean up,” while he earned an undergraduate degree in Food and Resource Economics. The Meat Lab facility 
was a learning experience where students learned the brass tacks of : meat processing, research, and meat 
sales/pricing at the university’s meat retail store.

0 06 42 After Brian learned the slaughter process for sheep, goats, pigs, and cattle “all the way up through the 
retail cut of those animals,” the university offered him an assistantship to continue working in the Meat Lab 
while he earned a Master’s degree in Meat Science. That’s were he learned the paperwork and the USDA side 
of the meat business yet was able to keep up his skills as a meat cutter. 
0 07 43 Brian prefers the cold temperature of the meat cutting room to the 100 degree heat he experienced 
growing up and working outside on his family’s Florida farm.   
0 08 07 Brian describes following his passion as a hands-on person, proud of his past work repairing 
fiberglass boats, mechanics, and welding. He discusses what he enjoys about cutting meat and how his job has 
changed over the past almost decade and he now regrets not being able to cut meat often enough as part of 
his job. 
0 08 47 Brian reminisces about the path that brought him to WOP and Will Harris (owner of WOP) 
attention. He was recommended to Will by Dr. Tim Marshall, a well-known cattleman and one of Brian’s 
professors who knew Will and knew how Will wanted to expand WOP from a cattle farm that sent its 
animals away for processing to a farm that both grew and processed its animals under strict humane 
protocols.  
0 10 08 Brian describes one of his early conversations with Will when he was being evaluated as a potential 
hire — at a time when the family business had just four employees and was rapidly expanding. Will admired 
the replacement bumpers that Brian had built and welded onto his pickup truck. Will kicked the bumper and 
said, “Damn, that’s nice!” He saw that Brian has multiple skills, critical for a rancher and entrepreneur and 
that was the key to his being hired. 
0 11 04 Brian cites as another factor leading to his choice of work — his having grown up on a three-
generation, 80-acre caladium bulb farm in Lake Placid, FL. He gained valuable experience planting, drying, 
processing, packaging, and shipping the bulbs. It’s a crop that’s quite similar to potatoes, he says.  
Farm work, Brian says, comes with long hours in all kinds of weather, and is a family experience. He knew 
the challenges. He has an an older brother and a younger sister, who are still in Lake Placid in the family 
business. 
0 12 35 Brian offers additional information about his personal life, coming to Bluffton as a single man, his 
marriage and the birth of his daughter, and his family’s building and moving into a new house, one of the 
first new homes in the rural town of Bluffton — a testament to how agricultural work at WOP is reviving a 
dying rural American town.  
0 13 56 WOP expansion during Brian’s nine years and counting. People were hired “to work in meat” 
meaning processing. Although the farm started with cattle and a few sheep, all species of poultry were added 
as well as goats and rabbits. The farm also started organic gardening. As a result, the farm’s personnel grew 
from 15 to more than 130 people now.  
Brian expands on his admiration for Will as a person who “sticks his neck out for something he believes in” 
and who finds the right people to make his ideas work key to employee retention and company financial 
health. 
0 16 26 Typical days for Brian when he started at the farm in 2008 were routine, but now every day is 
different. Now, he puts in 10- to 12-hour work days with 50 percent office work and 50 percent facilitation 
and interactions: human resources, sales, customer interactions, and meetings with farmers and producer’s 
groups. He is part of a good work team that spreads the work load.

0 18 07 Important in Brian’s work is the farm’s relationship between the cattlemen and livestock managers. He 
details the way the farm works with the producer group of farmers who grow cattle for WOP under its 
humane treatment protocols, and he gives the line up of production schedules for slaughter, processing, and 
sales, with examples. 
0 20 11 Brian explains WOP’s work with two producer groups: one under the American Grassfed Association 
(AGA), which is the USDA label, and the other the Global Animal Partnership rating (the GAP rating of 
Whole Foods). The farm sources cattle from both, working with 18 producers who raise cattle under the 
WOP protocol. 
Development of the producer groups. Originally the farm processed its own cattle, but as the on-farm supply 
of animals was too small to run the abattoir efficiently, WOP reached out to family farms within a 80-mile 
radius, offering to buy their cattle if they raised them by WOP protocol. This practice / business model has 
crafted relationships, retained jobs regionally and built community. 
0 23 32 Employees who work for Brian and the types of jobs in the abattoirs. There are two managers under 
Brian, one for the white meat (poultry) abattoir and one for the red meat abattoir. They directly report to 
him. The red meat manager has about four supervisors under him, set up by room: a slaughter supervisor, a 
processing supervisor, a further-processing supervisor, and a shipping supervisor. Each supervisor has 
workers. Supervisors call the shots. They have weekly meetings. 
There’s a similar setup in the poultry facility. The manager, a young woman who worked her way up, has a 
slaughter supervisor and a processing supervisor who, in turn, have good workers who get the job done. 
Breaking down the work for hourly labor is key to making the facility work smoothly. 
Workers on the slaughter side of their facility do the killing and skinning—removing guts and keeping 
carcasses clean. On the processing side, there are meat cutters who break down the carcasses and others who 
debone. Most workers on the processing side grind and package meat for retail sales. 
0 25 52 Brian says that finding laborers is easy in this job-stricken area. WOP is probably the largest privately-
owned farm in Early County for year-round work. Half the workforce in the plants (managers and 
supervisors) have been at the farm for seven years. The farm takes care of them. The rest of the folks have 
been at the farm for three or four years.  
This is atypical in the meat industry.  
Large US processing facilities have 100 percent worker turnover annually; “our farm’s turnover is closer to 12 
percent to 15 percent.” The farm pays all of them at least 50 cents above minimum wage, tries to take care of 
them and give them a good, safe work environment.  
0 28 15 Brian details how the farm takes care of its workers. WOP provides a good, living wage, a clean and 
safe work environment, health insurance (with the farm paying 50 percent of the premium), and some 
supplemental insurance that the workers get on their own. Workers get half price food when they eat at The 
Pavilion (the on-farm restaurant/dining hall), and they and their immediate families get a 20-percent discount 
at the General Store. As long as the workers get the job done in a safe and clean way, the farm gives them 
some leeway to do other things. 
0 30 00 What Brian enjoys about his work now that he’s not fabricating as much is coming to the office, being 
with colleagues and Will Harris’s family, and working with animals, even if only twice a year.  
0 30 53 Brian describes meat economics and the leather arm of WOP which started the first day the farm 
killed a cow. In the beef/cattle slaughter industry, everything that drops off the dead animal before it goes 
into the cooler should cover the slaughter costs. The hide, heart, liver, and all that comes out of the animal’s 
inside should generate enough in sales to pay the costs of slaughtering that animal. White Oak Pastures knew 
that going into this business.

The farm started by salting the majority of the hides and finding a “pinhooker,” a man who travels around, 
buys hides, and sorts and sells them. In the early days of the abattoir, each week, several pinhookers came 
around and wanted to buy WOP hides but paid nothing for them. Originally, Brian explained, this was fine 
with the farm, because it had but 10 or 12 hides a week, but once it were up to 25 head a day, “we realized 
that we could get $25, $30, or $40 a hide. When production rose and the farm was shipping 500 or 600 at a 
time to a fleshing plant, those hides were worth about $40 or $45 each.” Hides are now back to $22 to $28 a 
piece. 
Why the hide price fluctuation? Brian discusses how the US economy in the aughts affected the leather 
industry, which tanked. Leather couches and car seats weren’t selling, and the hide business is tied to the 
leather industry. “The farm rode that wave and is still selling to the guys who stop by to get rid of the hides.” 
However, the farm is now contracting the hides in load lots going to a fleshing plant in Kentucky, and it’s 
using more hides on the farm: making pet treats, sending some hides to Florida to cure and tan, then making 
purses, wallets, and belts with those cured hides (which are returned to the farm for coloring and sewing) 
which are sold in the WOP General Store. We’re utilizing more hides on-farm and getting closer to the retail 
sale of our animal hides as a finished good. Brian thinks this business will grow. 
Brian discusses WOP’s distinction for its zero-waste and regenerative farming/ranching practices. Any meat 
scraps, bones, anything the farm can’t sell, are ground up and composted with peanut hulls, a carbonaceous 
material is also created by breaking down animal bones not used in sales, making organic fertilizer that is used 
on the farm. Also, the water that is used mostly for cleanup at the processing facilities and that goes down the 
drains, is reclaimed through a waste water system and then applied back on the land. 
0 36 01 Continuing the description of zero-waste practices: The animal’s guts go to compost, and the blood 
goes into an anaerobic/aerobic digester to turn it into a liquid fertilizer. The hides are sold “just because we 
don’t have a tannery yet,” or they’re simply used back on the farm “as some kind of input.” 
Brian describes the Black Soldier Fly Project. In this process, Brian explains, we feed meat scraps to the flies 
and their larvae. When they are ready to pupate, we use them as a food source for the chickens. The Black 
Soldier Fly Project started on a small scale in 2010, and now we produce 5 percent to 8 percent of the 
chicken’s feed weight, and it’s not costing much to do that. The amount of feed produced via this project is 
currently small, but we hope to increase it. The end goal for WOP is to use more of the meat scraps and not 
have to compost all of it.  
0 39 00 Brian discusses his attention to employees’ work practices — revealed in his linking of music, 
repetitive work, cross-training and production. The guys in the cutting room listen to the radio and, 
sometimes, someone walking by the window starts dancing… Music gets workers into a rhythm and, if it’s cut 
off, there’s about 20 percent less production. 
Repetitive work is a feature of large processing facilities—red meat and poultry—with workers standing in 
one place making the same cut over and over and over as the carcasses come by. At WOP, the workers are 
cross-trained. Most switch positions during the day, working in one area in the morning and in another in the 
afternoon, or they switch every two hours. Repetitive motion, yes, but they’re not making the same cut all the 
time as in a large processing facility.  
By design, cross-training reduces fatigue and accidents and keeps workers in good spirits, knowing that it they 
don’t like what they’re currently doing, they can change two hours later or in the afternoon. 
0 41 23 Brian describes how different animals come through this multi-species farm. We started killing 12 to 
15 sheep every month, and now we’re in a groove: cattle on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday. On 
Wednesday, we change things and kill 10 or 12 sheep or goats or both. We debone once a week.

On the poultry side, they alternate: chickens, today, turkeys tomorrow, ducks the next day, guineas and geese 
another day. It’s all poultry, but smaller or larger birds. Just doing something different helps the workers.  
Brian comments on the future of agricultural work in Bluffton for his daughter and other community 
members. His daughter, he says, will grow up surrounded by agriculture, with her father on the production 
side and her mother in ag education, so she’s well set up to go into agriculture and imagines she will. 
0 43 59 Brian notes the changes that he has seen in Bluffton a result of the growth of this rural workplace. 
There’s more traffic, meaning that more folks are stopping in town and purchasing things, which means tax 
dollars for the county. Will is fixing up houses for employees so they have local places to live and and the 
General Store adds value to the community as well. WOP is putting value back into a farming community 
that has struggled.  
Brian explains the uniqueness of the WOP operation. Around the country, other farming communities that 
are like Bluffton used to be probably won’t get any better, because of the practice of commodity row crop 
farming. WOP is creating jobs.  Here on 2,200 acres there are 135 employees because of the humane and 
regenerative practices.  
By contrast, row crop farming needs just one farmer and one tractor driver. With technology comes no jobs 
and that’s where many other operations are with regard to work. If a tractor driver can push a button, he can 
plant cotton, corn, soybeans, whatever and never has to touch the steering wheel. With GPS technology, he 
can plant thirty feet at at time, pushing a button to turn and again to line him up again to plant.   
0 46 14 Brian comments on the future, beyond WOP’s seemingly continual expansion mode, which is already 
future-facing and includes partnering with Alabama colleagues to process pork, adding a general store, 
producing pet chews, and getting into leather making. Beyond this, he sees starting a ready-to-eat facility 
which would further processing some farm products “to a more end-customer level, for example creating 
jerky or roast beef or deli meats. He also looks forward to expanding into tanning. 
0 49 02 Brian finds the on-farm restaurant, The Pavilion, a good addition to WOP. It uses all the meat and 
vegetables grown on the farm. Having farm workers get a good meal there without their having to drive 45 
minutes into town on a lunch break gives them some down-time and lets them save some money. Organic, 
sustainable meals prepared by a chef at the Pavilion run $3 to $4 a day for workers.  
0 50 27 Brian’s parting thoughts about the farming culture, the way it used to be, and how it is now—the 
transition from the farming community-type system to commodity production, then back to the community 
system. He reflects on the addition of 135 people/workers to the farm family; we take care of each other 
through pay, working environment, and work. Because of the success of their company model, though not 
without great financial risk, smaller farms in the midwest and northeast are modeled around WOP, raising and 
processing poultry, sheep, goats, or cattle but on a smaller scale. Will has the knack and expertise to make 
things work and, if they don’t, to figure out why and fix them. He’s a good, hardworking, and dedicated 
businessman, ending on what it’s been like to work for a strong, courageous boss who runs thins pretty 
democratically and how he’s grown as an employee because of this experience.
