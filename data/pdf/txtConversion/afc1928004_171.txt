THE OLD MAN'S DRUNK AGAIN. 
Words and Music by W ILL S. HAYS. 
As sung by GUS W ILLIAMS. 
The 11.r.usic of this Song is published by J. L. 
PETERS, New York. 
Price 35 cents. 
YOU'vn no doubt heard the song, 
Of ' Father dear, come home," 
And the fate of hungry little Ben, 
Who sent for him to come; 
how the old man used to " smile," 
And cause the family pain. 
But he let up for a 
little while, 
And then got drunk again. 
CHORUS. 
We've given him up for gone. 
He's lying in the lane, 
And almost every body knows, 
The old man's drunk again. 
He takes his morning nip, 
And loafs about the door; 
He told his family more than once, 
That he would drink no more ; 
But then he would forget 
From " benzine" to abstain, 
The police, they would come and say. 
"The old man's drunk again." 
We've given him up for gone, &c. 
He'd smash poor mother's nose, 
And upset brother Ned, 
And drive us all into Vie street, 
Then tumble into bed ; 
And when he'd be asleep, 
We'd go back and remain, 
Until lie woke and lett the house, 
To come home drunk again. 
We've given him up for gone, &c. 
" 
0 I 
Father, dear, come home," 
Stop drinking like a 
sow; - 
You've drank away the beds and stove, 
Don't swallow up the cow ; 
0 don't abuse the boys, 
And cause poor mother pain, 
Or we'll rebel and " go for you," 
, When you get drunk again. 
We've given him up for gone, tte.

LITTLE DICKEY BIRDS. 
Ant :—" Bold Fiserman." 
Written and composed by JOHN STETSON, expressly for the Burlesque 
of " ROBIN HOOD." 
Oh, I 
woke one fine morning 
And sallied forth for some sport, 
To catch the little feathered tribe, 
The truth I 
must tell. 
But when 1 
arrove at Pimlico 
The wind it did begin to blow 
1 
struck a 
big brier in my toe, 
And into the water I 
fell. 
Chant. — Into the bogs among the frogs, and the tittle-
bats and the brickbats, and the mosquitos bit me on the 
nose ; then 1 
arose with dirty clothes and bleeding nose ; 
1 
thought I 
heard my foe singing— 
CHORUS. 
Little Dickey Birds, little Dickey Birds, 
Who the dickens thought they were such a 
bore ; 
Little Dickey Birds, little Dicky Birds, 
Such a 
pest I 
never 5:1w. 
First I 
wriggled, then I 
striggled, 
In the water to shiny, 
I 
bellowed and I 
yellowed 
Out for help. but ill vain : 
Then down did I 
gently glide 
And floated with the silvery tide, 
But previously to that I 
cried, 
4‘ 
Farewell, Mary Jane." 
Chant. — On arriving at the terra firma at the bottom 
aqua para. I 
wrang my clothes out to dry ; a 
herd of mos-
quitos tackled my nasal organ, which caused the ruby to 
flow freely from my lobster colored proboscis, and I 
never 
shall forget the day I 
went looking for 
Little Dickey Birds! 
My ghost walked that night 
To the bed-side of Mary Jane, 
1 
told her how dead I 
was, 
" 
Then," says she " III go mad." 
" 
For. since my love's dead," says she, 
" 
Alt joy for me's fled," says she 
"ill go a 
raving mu iack," says she 
And she went very bad. 
Chant.— After she had torn her waterfall to smithereens 
and bit a 
biz, chunk out. of the bed-post, knocked out 
several of her false teeth, I woke her out of her (inlet 
slumbers, and promised her that never again would I 
go 
in search of 
Little Dickey Birds, ite. 
YOU NEVER MISS THE WATER TILL THE 
WELL RUNS DRY. 
When a 
child I 
lived at Flushing with my parents at the farm, 
The lessons that my mother taught to me were quite a 
charm 
She would often tike me on her knee when tired of childish play, 
And as she pressed me to her breast I've heard my mother say; 
CHORUS. 
Waste not, want not, is a 
maxim I 
would teach, 
Let your watch-word be despatch and practice what you preach, 
Do not let your chances like sunbeams pass you by, 
For you never miss the water till the well runs dry. 
As years roll'd on I 
grew to be a 
mischief-making boy, 
Destruction seemed my only sport it was my only joy, 
And well do I 
remember when oftimes well chastised, 
How father sat beside me, and thus has me advised; 
Waste not, want not, &c. 
When I 
arrived at manhood I 
embarked in public life, 
And found it was a 
rugged road, bestrewn with care and strife, 
I 
speculated foolishly, my losses were severe, 
But still a 
little voice kept whispering in my ear. 
Waste not, want not, 4rIrc. 
Then I 
studied strict economy and found to my surprise, 
My funds instead of sinking very quickly then did rise, 
I 
grasped each chance and always struck the iron while twas hot, 
I 
seized my opportunities and never once forgot: 
Waste not, want not, &c. 
Fm nytrrie I 
now an I 
happy, I've a 
careful little wife, 
We live in peace and harmony devoid of care and strife, 
Fortune smiles upon us, we have li!tle children three, 
The lesson that I 
teach them, as they prattle round my knee; 
Waste not, want not, etc. 
JACK OF HEARTS, COMEDIAN. 
Composed and sung by FATTIR STEWART. 
Aia—" Trinity Chimes." 
Good-evening, kind friends, 'here I 
be, 
I 
thought I'd just drop in to see, 
If there are any here like me, 
Who acts upon the stage. 
The people call me Jack of Hearts, 
Because I 
play auch funny parts, 
I 
laugh and cry, by fits and starts, 
Then fly into a 
rage. 
(Iniita(ions.) 
CHORUS. 
I'm very f 
nny, some folks say, 
To see me sad, makes you feel gay, 
Wha I 
call work, you call play, 
Oh I 
I 
wish it was salary day. 
The funniest thing I've got to tell, 
Is about a 
girl named Isabel, 
With her over ears in love I: fell, 
While acting on the stage. 
To-day, she did my heart (Hight, 
By saving, that on next Sunday night, 
She'd be my wife, all right and tight, 
I 
laughed, you may engage. 
(Business of laughing, 4-e.) 
I'm very funny. ctc. 
They say, that true love never runs smooth 
And here's a 
letter which goes to prove 
What a 
fool I 
was to fall in love, 
While acting on the stage. 
To-day she went for water, to the well, 
She leaned too far, and in she fell, 
And down to the bottom wen:, Isabel, 
So now I'll leave the stage. 
(Business of crying.) 
I'm very funny, & c. 
OH I'M WASTING AWAY. 
Sung by TONY PASTOR. 
Oh, I'm a 
sample of a 
used- up man, 
Afflicted with a 
thousand ills, 
Vean't get fat, do what I 
can. 
Just look as these halt-starved gills, 
My parents were as thin as I, 
They never had a 
shadow— so people say, 
They w'en't off like a.pufr, they couldn't die, 
And their boy is wasting away. 
Oh l it's a 
pity that I'm so thin, 
I'm sure that I 
shall never get fat, 
I 
look like a 
small-sized clothes pin, 
To find me you must get a 
map. 
The doctor recommended me, 
To drink nothing else but so-long tea, 
But I 
busted a 
brewery not far from here, 
Where they sold Cincinnatti beer ; 
Oh, I 
worry and cry, and sob and fret, 
To see my filen& grow stout and gay, 
Fat on me 
never get, 
For, oh, Fin wasting away. 
Oh, it's a 
pity, 8co, 
All the gals they do me shun, 
And shake me for some other fell, 
They say I 
look like the barrel of a 
gun, 
Could be used for an umbrell; 
Oh, what will I 
do ? 011, where will I 
go? 
in the eye of an needle I 
make my stay, 
I'll never come out, till I 
get stout. 
For, oh, 
wasting away. 
Oh, it's a 
pity, tir,o,

GAFFER GREY 
Music by 
T. IIOICROTT. 
"Oh! why dost thou shiver and shake, 
Gaffer Grey ? 
And why cloth thy nose look so blue ?" 
" ' Tis the weather that's cold 
'Tis I'm grown very old, 
And my doublet is not very new, 
Well- a-day!" 
"Then line thy worn doublet with ale, 
Gaffer Grey, 
And warm thy old heart with a 
glass." 
"Nay, but credit I've none, 
And my money's all gone; 
Then say how may that come to pass, 
Well-a- day !" 
"Hie away to the house on the brow, 
Gaff,r Grey, 
And knock at the jolly priest's door." 
"The priest often preaches 
Against worldly riches, 
But ne'er gives a 
mite to the poor, 
Well-a-day !" 
" 
The lawyer lives under the hill, 
Gaffer Grey ? 
Warmly fenced both in back and in fron 
" 
He will fasten the bolts, 
And will threaten the stocks 
should he evermore find me in want, 
Well-a-day!" 
"The squire has fat beeves and brown ale, 
Gaffer Grey, 
And the season will welcome you there." 
"His fat beeves and his beer, 
And his merry new year, 
Are all for the flush and the fair, 
Well-a-day !" 
"My keg is but low, I 
confess, 
Gaffer Gre 
What then ? while it lasts, man, we'll live,' 
"The poor man alone, 
When he bears tho poor MOM,

'Twas on a 
summer's day, 
I 
met her all by chance, 
Her smile was bright and gay, 
And loving was her glance! 
We wandered in the " 
We 
strolled beside the "lake" 
Fier pretty hand so white and small 
Of course, I 
chanced to take 
We talked about the swans, 
And all the other birds. 
I 
thought I 
heard sweet music, 
When I 
listened to her words I 
She leaned upon my arm, 
The sun went down the west, 
I 
tried in vain to whisper 
All the love within my breast. 
CHORUS. 
Twilight in the park, 
Twilight in the park, 
Cupid lingers there, 
And no one near to mark; 
Some one by your side, 
Happy as a 
lark! 
That's the time I 
love, 
Twilight in the park. 
She left me at the gate. 
And sweetly said good bye; 
I 
begged to know my 
fate, 
And half suppressed a 
sigh, 
She said she'd come again, 
And nam'd the time and place; 
Her absence gave my heart such pain, 
For heav'n shone in her face, 
So ev'ry day I 
watched in love's delightful trance) 
And sure enough we met again, 
She knew me at a 
glance; 
'Twas love at first sight, I 
said, 
And as the day grew dark, 
I 
wen' her heart tor evermore, 
At twilight in the park.

PORSIE JOE. 
Sung by TONY PASTOR,. 
It's about a 
month ago, I 
went to Fairlop fair, 
I 
took Sarah for a 
treat, and we looked a 
nobby pair; 
There was a 
lot of us hired a 
van, I 
should think about a 
score, 
But if we count the kids, there would be a 
dozen more; 
There was Mr. Porkie Joe, who thought I 
was a 
dunce, 
And soon got up his larks, so I 
gave him the tip at once. 
Spoken—Yes, Mr. Flash Joe was too fast from the beginning, 
so I 
said to him 
CLIOR,L13. 
You must keep your mawleys off of Sal; I 
don't, allow it, 
though a 
pal, 
Hit me, smash me, knock me down, but don't you touch my 
gal. 
We soon were on the road, and everything so gay, 
The horses had their load, and a 
good blow-out of hay, 
We had lots of grub in the van, and I 
enjoyed my pipe, 
After taking a 
swig of the can, and Sarah was eating some tripe, 
But Mister Porkie Joe, he couldn't leave Sal alone, 
So I 
said to him again, in a 
sort of an undertone, 
Spoken—Yes, Mr. Porkie Joe was too fast to begin with, so I 
said to him, Joe, 
You must keep your mawleys, cte. 
Lii 
PORICIE JOE.—[ (in 
—
NCLUDED. 
At last we got to V 
e 
fair, and Sarah went in a 
swing, 
And Mister Joe was there, dancing the highland fling, 
Then he bought a 
pea-shooter, a 
whopper, made of tin, 
And every now and then he would drop a 
hot-'un in. 
We went down a 
shady lane, to take a 
slight repose, 
When Mister Joe he dropped a 
horse-bean on Sarah's nose. 
Spoken—Now, that got my monkey up. 
I 
stood the peas, but 
when Sarah caught the bean on the nose, I 
said, " I 
tell you 
what it is, Mister Joe, I 
shall punch your head, if you don't lave 
Sal alone r " Why, I 
never touched her," said Joe. " No," 
says I, " but you laid that ere bean on her nose,"—showing 
Sarah's nose, which had swelled up as big as a 
Jersey crab. " So 
you had better take my advice, 
And keep your mawleys, ctc. 
At last be said to me, " I 
think just now you said, 
As how, as if as you could go and punch my head," 
And before I 
d 
time to speak, the left Duke he let fly, 
I 
stopped it—with my beak and the corner of my eye; 
Then we quickly formed a 
ring, and went it left and right, 
The police, they collared us both, and locked us up all night. 
Spoken—Yes, we both were locked up and the next morning 
the beak fined us ten bob a-piece. 
Joe said " be was sorry." 
I 
told him " it would have been better to have taken my advice, as 
I 
said to him from the first, 
You must keep your mawleys, & c.

DIY POOR HEART IS SAD WITH ITS 
DREAMING. 
Words and Music by T. ThnouAm Bisnor. 
The Music of this song is Published by J. 
L. 
PETIMEI, 599 Broadway, 
N. Y. Price 35 Cents. 
My poor heart is sad with its dreaming, 
It brings back the once happy day, 
When earth like a 
heaven was seeming, 
But now it has passed all away; 
They say that young love's like the flower, 
That needs tender care in its urn, 
But mine it was snatch'd from its bower, 
And I 
never gain'd one in return, 
CHORUS. 
My poor heart is sad with its dreaming, 
For it brings back the once happy day, 
When earth like a 
heaven was seeming, 
But now it has all pass'd away. 
My sad heart recalls all the pleasure, 
Of thoughts that were all, all for thee, 
When dreaming of you of its treasure, 
And you seem'd to love none but me; 
Tho' we meet not as friends, yet I'll never, 
One unkind word to thee give, 
For your cherished memory ever, 
Shall be my solo joy ,while I 
live. 
My poor heart, &c. 
WHEN YOU'RE MARRIED YOU'LL FIND II OUT. 
I 
am a 
married nin-coni-poop, 
You can tell by half a 
glance; 
A single mau I'd IL- e 
to be, 
if I 
could get a 
chance. 
But when a 
man gets married, 
it's all U 
I' with him ; 
Ws the sort of thing ladies like, 
To take us fellows in. 
CHORUS. 
Then, oh, dear, oh 
Lead a 
single life; 
A man he is a 
uin-con-poop, 
That takes himself a 
wife. 
Then, oh, dear, oh, 
Be fee, and frolic about ; 
Let ladies try, but pipe your eye, 
When you're married, you'll Lind it out. 
A fellow he gets spooney 
On a 
girl that looks a 
queen, 
if he don't propose in a 
fortnight, 
She asks him what he means; 
You must quickly marry, me; 
She knows her way about, 
lie don't— he's green—he marries her, 
And then he finds it out. 
Then, oh, dear, oh, Sm. 
Re takes his love down by the sea, 
To spend the honey moon; 
What should be honey, 
Always turns to cream of tartar soon. 
It's dear, oh, (lackey ! oh, darling! 
For a 
week or thereabout; 
And then she makes it warm for him ; 
When you're married, you'll find it out. 
Then, oh, dear, oh, &c. 
He once was stout and hearty, 
But now like me he's thin ; 
Perhaps his wife is tolerable, 
Perhaps she's fond of gin. 
I 
won't say which, but somehow 
His money it flies about, 
Till his uncle has to help him ; 
It's then he liuds it out. 
Then, oh, dear, oh ! 
Then in half a 
dozen years, 
Around your table there ; 
You count a 
dozen boys and girls, 
All yours— it makes you stare. 
they ain't, you have to keep the lot, 
Perhaps you've got the gent; 
Tie boys won't work. the girls don't want, 
Vhen you're married, you'll find it out. 
Then, oh, dear, oh & c.

Fish - er - man. 
First he wriggled, then he striggled, 
In the water so briny ; 
He bellowed, and be yellowed 
Out for help, but in vain; 
Then down did he gently glide, 
To the bottom of the silv'ry tide, 
But previously to that he cried, 
" 
Farewell, Mary Jane." 
CHANT—On arriving at the terra firma, at the bottom of the 
igua pura, he took a 
cough losenge, and murmured— 
Dinkle doodle dum, dinkle doodle dum, 
That's the refrain of the gentle song he sung, 
Dinkle doodle dum, dinkle doodle dm, 
Said the bold fisherman. 
His ghost walked that night 
To the bedside of his Mary Jane, 
He told her how dead he was; 
Then says she, " I'll go mad." 
" 
For since my love's dead," says she, 
"All joy from me's fled," says she, 
" go a 
raving luniack," says she, 
And she went, very bad. 
CHANT—She thereupon tore her best chignon to smithereens, 
danced the " Can-can" on top of the water-butt, and joined " the, 
woman's rights association," and frequently edifies the angelic 
members by softly chanting— 
Dinkle doodle dum, dinkle doodle dum, 
That's the kind of soul-inspiring song she sung, 
Dinkle doodle dum, dinkle doodle dum, 
Oh! the bold fisherman.

THE HAPPY YOUNG COSTER. 
Written and sung by G. MATHEW. 
You can see Fin a 
jolly young coster, 
And a 
few pounds I 
have by my side, 
So I 
thought I 
would make up my mind, boys, 
And start in the costering trade. 
And sticking to my rounds each morning, 
A 
lot of customers why I 
soon found, 
Which enables me, you know, my boys, 
To holler when going my rounds. 
etiones. 
Here's your fine strawberry, 
Apples four-a-penny, 
Currants and plums come every one, 
And taste before you buy ; 
Cabbage and turniptops, 
Celery and brokelo, 
Onions and beans, potatoes and greens, 
it is my daily cry. 
Now I 
am up with the lark in the morning, 
To market me and my moke do go, 
To buy my wares of the best kind 
And then we soon trot home again, 
We ha's a 
little bit of a 
rest then, 
And then I 
prepare to go on my rounds, 
And I 
have not been out long, before, boys, 
Why you will soon hear me hollering out. 
Here's your fine, &e. 
The servants all know when I 
am coming, 
By the sound of my voice when I 
cry, 
And when my goods I 
do show them, 
Bless their hearts they always do buy; 
And it to my trade I 
do stick. boys, 
I 
know my fortune is then made, 
And then I 
can be independent. 
And give up the costering trade. 
Here's your fine, tto. 
But before I 
leave you all to-night, 
I 
must let you all into a 
secret, 
For I 
have been courting such a 
pretty girl, 
And she has promised to be my wife. 
Now Sal and me I 
know will be happy, 
And if any children we have, 
We'll bring them up to the costering line, 
.And you will hear them hollering out. 
Here's you fine, fctc. 
MOTHER'S DEAD AND GONE. 
SONG AND CHORUS. 
Dedicated to my old friend, JOHN DOUGHERTY, of Philadelphia. 
Written by PHIL H. 
ArowsEY. 
In the gray o:d village church-yard, 
There is seen a 
grassy mound; 
There is where my mother's sleeping, 
Beneath the cod turf-covered ground. 
Brig test flowers cluster round it, 
Feathered warblers sing their song; 
While my heart is sad and lonely, 
For my mother's dead and gone. 
CII0BUS. 
Gently waves the weeping willow, 
Feathered songsters sing their song 
While my heart is sad and lonely, 
For my mother's dead and gone. 
I 
was young, yet I 
remember, 
That sad day when mother died; 
I 
sat watching, waiting, weeping, 
When she called me to her side. 
Whispering, I'll not see the morning, 
Angel voices bid me come; 
Trust in God, we'll meet in Heaven, 
When life's cares all are done. 
Gently waves, dm. 
Oft I 
wander to the church-yard, 
Tenderly I 
nurse the flowers; 
There beside my mf ther's grave, 
I 
pass many, many, hours. 
Looking on the sky above me, 
Wondering if it will be long; 
Ere the angels come to take me, 
To the place where mother's gone. 
Gently waves the weeping willow, 
Feathered songsters sing their song; 
While my heart is sad and lonely, 
For my mother's dead and gone.

STROLLING ON THE SANDS. 
Of course we all know Ramsgate well, 
That spot to thousands dear, 
Whore dashing belles and heavy 8 
wella, 
Assemble ev'ry year: 
Some like to roam along the Pier, 
And view what that commands, 
But my delight, from morn till night, 
Is strolling on the sands. 
CHORUS. 
Strolling on the sands, strolling on the sands, 
Watching all the bathers dip, list'ning to the band; 
Strolling on the sands, strolling on the sands, 
In cool or heat there's nought to beat a 
stroll upon the sands. 
I'll ne'er forget last summer-time, 
I 
spent a 
fortnight there, 
And made the sweet acquaintance of 
A lovely lady fair, 
She'd gone to bathe at Dumpton Gap, 
But, oh! the naughty quean, 
For once she thought she'd do without 
That vile bathing machine. 
She placed her clothes upon the beach, 
Then in the water played. 
But when she tried to come on shore, 
Oh! wasn't she dismayed ; 
The tide had turn'd, and all her clothes 
Were floating out to sea, 
She'd nothing but her bathing dress— 
In what a 
plight to be. 
I 
fetch'd her mother to her aid, 
And saved all further sti ife, 
The maiden said, " this gr eat event 
I'll think of all my life." 
We soon became the best of friends 
For all enjoy'd the fun ; 
We're lovers now—and soon we two 
Are going to be one. 
Strolling, &o.

BLACKWELL'S ISLAND. 
Sung by TONY PASTOR. 
AM.." Ten Thousand Miles away." 
Sing I 
of a 
gallant Isle, my boys, not many miles away, 
Where there's lots of time for digging stone, and little time for play; 
Where we get no lush, but lots of mush, and they w'ollop you if you 
smile: 
It's opposite to Jones' Wood, and they call it Blackwell's Isle. 
CHORUS. 
Judge Dowling told me so, to Blackwell's Isle I'll go, 
Just at Bellevue, I'll say adieu, to my true love so gay; 
For the steamboat now does wait, 
To carry me in state, 
And I'll stay for a 
while on Blackwell's Isle, 
Not many miles away. 
While buzzing in a 
Broadway stage, I 
met a 
country bloke, 
1 
faked his cly, so nice and sly, went through him for a 
joke, 
But a 
cop did drop, he caught me pop, he stagged my game in style, 
And they didn't send me to Ludlow street, but up to Blackwell's Isle, 
For the Judge, & c. 
When I'm at that summer resort, which aint much like Long Branch. 
How many a 
day I'll feel quite gay, could I 
vamoose the rancho; 
When I 
think of my girl at Jones' Wood, with another cull waltzing 
gay, 
Then I'll feel so melancholy when the band begi

Judge, 
d-ge, 
When Jim Fisk's boats so gaily floats, close to the Ilellgate shore, 
And I 
think of the stateroom I 
have cracked, and like to do once 
MOTO; 
Of the wallets full I 
used to pull, with my moll to work the pay, 
While all alone Pm breaking stone, from my pals so far away. 
For the Judge, &c. 
It I 
had my way on some fine day, I'd set the Tombs on fire, 
Such a 
flame I'd raise, and in the blaze I'd bnim the Black Maria. 
The peelers, too, I'd catch the crew, and roast them on the pile; 
And each judge what lives, six moons I'd give way 
up at Blackwell's 
Isle.
Spoken—Hey, Shorty Gilliver, wouldn't that be bully ? 
We'd hay, 
all our own way then, and— 
No Judge to tell me so, itc

The freedom to use my tongue pleased me no doubt. 
For a 
woman, you know, would be nothing without, 
I 
went towards the mill without any delay, 
And conned o'er the words I 
determined to say,— 
But when I 
came near it, I 
found it stock still! 
" 
Bless my stars," then said I, " scold him rarely I 
will." 
" 
Bless my stars," then said I, " scold him rarely I 
will." 
The miller to market that moment was gone, 
But the mill it was left to the care of his son ; 
Now though I 
can scold well, as any one can, 
I 
thought 'twere a 
pity to scold the young man! 
I 
said, " I'm surprised you can use me so ill, 
I 
must have my corn ground, I 
must and I 
will! 
I 
must have my corn ground, I 
must, and I 
will!" 
Said he, " Pretty maiden, the fault is not mine, 
There's no corn in the town I'll grind sooner than thine, 
I'm always most ready in pleasing ' the fair,' 
And the mill shall go merrily round, I 
declare, 
But, hark! how the birds sing, and see how they bill, 
I 
must have a 
kiss first, I 
must, and I 
will! 
I 
must have a 
kiss first, I 
must, and I 
will !" 
My corn being ground I 
t'wards home bent my way, 
He whispered he'd something of moment to say; 
Insisted he'd hand me along the green mead, 
And there swore he'd loved me, indeed and indeed, 
And that he'd be constant and true to me still! 
Since that time I've loved him, and love him I 
will! 
Since that time I've loved him, and love him I 
will!

PRETTY LITTLE DEWDROP BROWN. 
Song anit Dance by BILLY EMERSON. 
When the moon is shining brightest, 
And the zephyrs softly blow; 
When the waves are beating lightest. 
Up the Avenue I 
go, 
And at the Parson's gate I 
met. 
The prettiest girl in town, 
I 
love to kiss thy ruby lips, 
Pretty little Dewdrop Brown. 
CITORUS. 
HO 
! my little bonnie dear, 
The loveliest girl in town. 
Ho! my little bonnie dear, 
The loveliest girl up town, 
I 
love thee more from day, to day, 
Pretty little Dewdrow Brown. 
Thou'rt always standing at the gate, 
By the cottage on the hill; 
To greet me with a 
happy smile, 
Thy soldier lover will. 
Oh ! amid the heat of battle, 
When the shells were bursting round. 
Did I 
hear thy merry prattle, 
My dear little Dewdrop Brown. 
Ho! my little, cbs. 
Oh! thine eyes they are the brightest 
And thy voice so full of mirth, 
That me thinks thou art a 
fairy. 
Who has visited this earth. 
Over all the world I've wandered, 
Never, never have I 
found, 
A Peri half so lovely, as 
My sweet little Dew drop Brown. 
Ho I 
my little, AT-
NEVER GO BACK ON YOUR WORD. 
Oh, white folks, I'll sing you a 
ditty, 
If you will listen to my little song, 
And if it don't please it's a 
pity, 
And I 
promise to not keep you long, 
The subject of my song it is wholesome, 
The music no doubt you have heard, 
And 1 
promised to sing you a 
new one, 
And I'll never go back on my word. 
There was Old Hickory Jackson, 
At the battle of New Orleans, 
It was there lie gave General Packenham 
The best of his good Yankee beaus, 
He says now boys we must whip them, 
And he looked at his trusty old sword, 
He gave them gunpowder and cotton, 
And he did not go back on his word 
In the days of the old revolution, 
Or ic the days of old seventy-six, 
Our country was in a 
commotion, 
And the British were playing dirty tricks, 
We sent for a 
man for to help us, 
To drive off that tyrannical horde, 
George Washington said he would do it, 
And he never went back on his word.

PLODDING THROUGH THE RAIN. 
Sitting lately at my window 
On a 
rainy day, 
Time I 
whiled away by watching 
All who passed that way. 
From the weather some protected, 
Others moved in pain; 
Some in hunger, cold, neglected, 
Wretched in the rain. 
Plodding, tripping, 
Drenched and dripping, 
Wretched in the rain. - 
Postman comes, delivers letters, 
Sorely I'm afraid, 
Of public servants, few are better, 
None so badly paid. 
Men must vary in their station, 
Let him not complain ; 
But heaven keep him from temptation, 
Plodding through the rain. 
Plodding, tripping, etc. 
A 
female form my eye next catches, 
Carrying a 
child, 
Singing snatches, selling matches, 
See, the infant smiled. 
Still closer nestled to its mother, 
Drops to sleep again ; 
May He befriend them—they've no other. 
Wretched in the rain. 
Plodding, tripping, etc. 
Relief I 
gave them, food and money, 
Speedily they're gone ; 
Grim policeman, gaunt and stoney, 
Bids her to move on. 
PLODDING THROUGH THE RAIN.—CONTINUED. 
Duty makes this man suspicious, 
Beggars sigh in vain; 
He thinks all kindness injudicious, 
To paupers in the rain. 
Plodding, tripping, etc. 
Eyes half opened, peeping from an 
Old, uneasy seat, 
Weather-beaten, apple-woman, 
Wherefore in the street ? 
To the gin shop should she totter, 
Just to get a 
drain ; 
For such indulgence pray blame not her, 
Sitting in the rain. 
Sitting, slipping, etc. 
See, with pliant step and supple, 
Two folks next appear; 
Watch that loving, courting couple, 
Closer drawing near. 
'Neath one small umbrella walking, 
Whispering love's old strain, 
Heedless of the weather, talking, 
Happy in the rain. 
Trotting, tripping, etc. 
Rest to some men would be hunger, 
Hand to mouth they live ; 
Carman, ' busman, oyster dredger, 
Daily have to strive 
Watching life's damp, dreary feature, 
I've not looked in vain, 
If more I 
love my fellow creature, 
Plodding in the rain. 
Plodding, tripping, etc.

ONE AT HOME Win PRAYS FOR ME, 
olt, 
WHO HAS NOT A PRAYING MOTHER ? 
words by H ENRY' M . 
H UNT. 
Musics by FIEVTO Twins 
At midnight, on my lonely beat, 
When shadow wraps the wood and lea, 
A 
vision seems my view to greet 
Of one at home who prays for me; 
No roses bloom upon her cheek, 
Her form is not a 
lover's dream, 
Bt 
o'er that brow so pure and meek, 
thousand holier beauties gleam. 
CHORUS. 
Who has not a 
praying mother, 
Wheresoe'er his lot may be 
Ev'ry wand'rer feels in darkest hour 
There's one at home who prays for me. 
How softly shines her silver hair, 
A 
patient smile is on her face, 
And that mild lustrous light of prayer 
Around her sheds a 
moonlike grace; 
She prays for me so far away--
The soldier in his holy fight 
And begs that Heaven in mercy may 
Protect her boy and bless the right I 
Who hail not. &s. 
Still though the leagnes lie far between, 
This silent incense of her heart 
Steals o'er my soul with breath serene, 
And we no longer are apart; 
So guarding thus my lonely beat 
By shadowy wood and ha.inted. lea, 
That vision seems my view to greet 
Of her at home who prays for me, 
Whcha-s Atilti.

SILVER PLATED MEN. 
Written by BOBBY NEWCOMB, and sung by Gus. Virmusits. 
The rounkz of this song is published by Win Hall and Son. 751 Broad. 
way, New York. Price 35 Cents. 
Iii life we find some funny folks, 
Whose ways are very strange, 
But as you journey through the world, 
Of course we like a 
ellange ; 
People of true metal are 
A 
scarcity, but then 
We know their value when we deal, 
With Silver plated men. 
CIIOR1JS. 
Then always be straight-forward, boys, 
Let your motto read, 
Remember when you want a 
friend, 
A friend's a 
friend indeed ; 
Act on the square to every one, 
They'll all speak of you then, 
As not belonging to the class, 
Called Silver plated tnen. 
(a45.40) 
When driven by adversity, 
And fortune leaves your side, 
'Tis then you need a 
helping hand, 
The troubled sea to ride ; 
You soon find out the sunshine friends, 
For what's your cares to them, 
They promise much and nothing do ; 
They're Silver plated men. 
Then always be, ctc. 
A man's like gold or silver, and 
The way to try him best, 
Is judge not by appearances, 
But put him to the test ; 
You'll soon find out what he is worth, 
You'll know him surely then. 
If he's true metal, he is worth, 
A hundred plated men 
Then always be, &R.. 
WHERE THE BRIGHT WAVES ARE DASHING. 
Where the bright waves are dashing, 
And the wind cometh free, 
There thy white sail is flashing 
On the blue summer sea; 
Thy sweet carol ringing, 
So bird-like and so gay, 
Thy dark locks outflinging, 
To the merry breeze's play. 
Is the gale rudely blowing_ 
Still thy hearts feels no care ; 
On its swift pinions going, 
Thy white sail is there; 
Above the loud waves dashing 
Thy carol rises free, 
Thy dark eyes are flashing 
O'er the wild foamy sea. 
There's a 
kind angel watching 
Thy bark on its way; 
His white wings are over thee 
By night as by day; 
Glide on thy way unfearing, 
No ill may come to thee ; 
There's a 
kind angel watching 
O'er the wtid foamy sea.

REMEMBRANCE OF HOME: OR HOME ON01 
MORE. 
Wrrtten, Composed and Sung by Gus "WiLuAms. 
I 
am thinking of my home, 
Of the cottage on the hill; 
The cottage where my poor old mother died: 
Of the orchard, of the school where I 
learned the golden 
rule 
Of old " Dobbin" on wkose back I 
oft did ride: 
And as I 
recall the scene, 
It seems just like a 
dream ; 
A dream that is past now, and is o'er: 
A tear comes in my eye, and I 
can only sigh, 
For to see my dear and good old home once more. 
CHORUS. 
Home once more, home once more, 
Shall I 
ever see my home once more ? 
Home once more, home once more, 
Shall I 
ever see my home once more ? 
Shall I 
ever see the church where I 
often used to go? 
Shall I 
ever see that dear old church again ? 
Shall I 
ever see the mill that stood right near the hill, 
Or must I 
in a 
foreign land remain ? 
Shall I 
ever see my father? 
That dear old grey haired man, 
As he sat in the arm-chair by the door 
I 
have power, I 
have wealth, 
Yet I'd give them all for health, 
So that I 
could see my dear old home once more. 
Home once more, (le. 
DARLING MINIONETTE-
You may talk about your fascinating beauties( 
Your fashionable blondes and Pretty belles; 
But the subject of my song I'm going to sing you. 
Is par excellence the queen of all the swells. 
We met, 'twas in a 
crowd and then we parted, 
The beauty of her face I 
will ne'er forget, 
As she never told her name I 
cannot tell it : 
But I 
have christened her my Darling Minionette. 
CHORI15 
She is sweeter than the flowers I 
name her after, 
And the memory of her beauty haunts me yet. 
There is a 
band of opera music in her laughter, 
You will know her she is my Darling Minionetto 
She looked at me, a 
glance was all I 
wanted, 
As I 
followed her along the crowded street, 
And my memory with her loveliness was haunted, 
As she tripped so lightly on those fairy feet. 
The second time she cast her eye upon me, 
She smiled on me and then a 
moment more, 
She rang the bell and faded from my vision, 
Then all was dull, for she was there no more. 
She is sweeter, dze. 
Next day in hopes to see my little darling, 
I 
sought the house, 'twas No. ninety four, 
When the poodle in the house commenced a 
snarling, 
And barking loudly chased me from the door, 
I 
ran along the street and he ran after, 
And with his teeth he seized my pantaloons, 
He hung on while the crowd convulsed with laughter. 
Cried that's the chap that stole the silver spoons. 
She is sweeter. dm

W H Y DIDN 'i' YOU SAY SO BEFORE. 
As = lig by Gus W ILLIAMS. 
New by-words you know now-a-days, are the rage, 
You'll hear them from every tongue; 
Wherever you go you'll find that it's so, 
The little, the big, old and young; 
Even the ladies are fond of the slang, 
While the boys in the street loudly roar, 
Oh, how they do shout, the latest one out, 
Why didn't you say so before! 
One day driven mad with a 
toothache so bad, 
I 
rushed to the first doctor's shop, 
When the grinder he eyed and the tongs he applied, 
And he pulled me six times round the shop; 
Said I, when he'd done, you've pulled out the wrong one, 
While with agony loud I 
did roar; 
Now it's done, sir, says he, the fault don't lay with me; 
Why didn't you say so before! 
I 
once asked a 
friend me ten dollars to /end, 
And said : I'd return it next day. 
When he did begin at once to rub his chin, 
And these words, unto me he did say ; 
Old boy, it's too bad, I 
should have been glad, 
In fact, I'd have let you have more 
Had you called yesterday,—now, it's all paid away, 
Why didn't you say so before! 
My wife yesterday sat crying away, 
Because our first-born was a 
boy; 
All day she would sigh and keep rubbing her eye, 
Instead of being happy ',Tali joy; 
Says she to me, -Toe, I 
hate boys, you know, 
I'd soonel .of,girls.have ascOre; 
Says I (with a

Why didn't you say so before I • ,. • 
DEW D'ANDIES. 
Words by Wm. H. DminLorry. 
Music by T. BRIGHAM BISHOP, 
Now I'm going to tell you all a 
little story, 
But I 
promise you Pll not detain you long; 
It's about a 
darling, charming, little sweet one, 
She's the captivating subject of my song. 
But I'll tell you how we talked and how we flirted, 
When I 
met this belle: 
And ' twas then I 
called her little Dew D'Andies, 
For her name she would not tell. 
CHORUS. 
She's so sweet— and so neat 
Oh I 
love the charming little Dew D'Andies, 
She's the sweetest girl that ever you did see, 
And she often sings me love among the roses. 
Now boys, she's just the girl for me. 
When I 
met her first ' twos out upon a 
pic-nic, 
And I 
shall never forget her winning smile, 
For she danced and made the changes in the music, 
With her graceful pretty fascinating smile. 
Then I 
asked her for her name and her directions, 
For I'd like to call, 
Then she turned around and whispered Dew D'Andies, 
And she smiling said 'twos all. 
She's so sweet, (Le. 
So, now listen to the sequel of my story, 
For as time rolled on we dearer friends became ; 
And though yet I 
call her little Dew D'Andies, 
I 
am sure she's got another pretty name. 
I 
have placed a 
ring upon her taper finger, 
So we're one, life for life; 
And Rosy May my little Dew D'Andies, 
Is my darling, charming wife. 
She's so sweet, 4c.

THE DASHING BELLE. 
Composed and sung by FATTIE STEWART. 
My name is Nell, the dashing belle, 
Some call me a 
coquette, 
Of lovers l've had many score, 
But not the right one yet. 
And as I 
pass along the street, 
The Gents all bow and smile, 
I 
hear them cry, as I 
pass by, 
Oh ! how is that for sl:yle 
CHORUS. 
For I 
am Nell, the Dashing Belle, the Gents all on me smile, 
They heave a 
sigh, as I 
pass by, and say, how is that for sty e ? 
I 
go to Balls and Operas, 
Sometimes a 
Matinee, 
And often drive out through the Park, 
To pass the time away. 
The other evening to the minstrels, 
thought I'd go a 
while, 
But when I 
corn,: out, the boys did shout, 
Oh I 
how is that for style ? 
For I

STEAM'S UP, DARKIES. 
All de world is in commotion, 
People scarcely time to dream; 
Nothing else but locorriotion, 
Eb'ry thing is done by steam. 
Quiet times are out of fashion,

3f this world that you can dash on 
Al a 
break-neck railroad pace. 
CHORUS.

SWATE CASTLE GARDEN. 
When I 
landed at Swate Castle Garden, 
I'd just came from the say, 
In my pockets I 
had not a 
farthing, 
As I 
stepped out up the Broadway; 
I 
walked up to a 
lamp-lighter, 
The mystery for to unravel, 
His hair was cut short, like a 
fighter, 
So I 
shouldered my bundle and travelled. 
CHORUS. 
Hurrah for the stars and the stripes, 
And the land where we never see fogs, 
If I 
hadn't come here, by the pipes, 
I'd been digging up turf in the bogs 
Shure the road it was dirty and sloppy, 
Until I 
came to a 
street they call Wall, 
A blackguard shouted, there goes a 
Croppy. 
Whin I 
kim to the big City Hall, 
I 
axed a 
Dutch barber the way; 
He answered me dunder and blitzen, 
And a 
big old at Yankee stepped out, 
And made me an American citizen. 
Hurrah for the Stars, cto 
The first time I 
wint out to Chicago, 
The weather it was very warm 
The Commissioners axed me if I'd go 
And settle upon a 
nice farm. 
No, says I, I'll go back to New-York, 
Where the Politicks they are so pretty, 
Lave your Dutchmen stop here and work, 
But be jabers I'll stick to the City. 
Hurrah for the Stars, &e. 
ad luck to that villain from Sligo, 
Shure he tould me Lis name it *as Hubbs 
Re sould me a 
caul for Chicago; 
Be my soul, 'twas an ou d

But I

I'll be running for Sheriff next election,

Perhaps with fond words greeting; 
This fellow's always sneaking, 
And ev'ry word will hear. 
And now she goes, &c. 
I 
made up my mind one morning, 
Upon this fellow calling, 
To tell him of my falling 
In love with Kitty dear, 
Well I 
did repent it, 
For he raised his fist and sent it 
To my nose and bent it, 
What shall I 
do ? oh dear 1 
For her I'm always fretting. 
The tears my eyes are wetting, 
So I'll drown my woes in betting, 
For I've always in my car—

THE SNOW WHITE BLOSSOMS.—CONCLUDED. 
'Mid smiling nature's varied charms, 
We'll roam and chat awhile; 
Our hearts unswayed by anxious care, 
Our tongues untouched with guile; 
Secluded from the world around, 
From busy lane and street, 
The bright blue sky above our heads, 
The daisies at our feet; 
Cho.—There we will linger side by side, 
Till evening fades away, 
Near the little suow-white blossoms : 
So beautiful are they. 
WILLIE, MY BRAVE. 
On the lonely sea-beat shore, 
A 
maiden fair was weeping, 
Calling one who far away 
Beneath the wave was sleeping: 
Thus the sad, unchanging strain 
Floated ever on the main— 
Cho.—" Come o'er the billow, 
Ride on the wave: 
Come while the wind bloweth, 
Willie, my brave! " 
He said his bar] ; would soon return, 
And with a 
kiss they parted: 
But, when a 
year had passed away, 
She then grew weary-hearted. 
Oh! 'twas sad from day to day 
To hear the maiden's plaintive lay— 
Cho.—Come o'er the Lillow, &c. 
None who knew the maiden's grief, 
And saw her heart's devotion, 
Would tell her of the fragile bark. 
That sank beneath the ocean: 
But when all hope had passed away, 
Her life breathed forth its parting lay— 
Cho.—Come o'er the billow, dr.e.

ROGUISH CORA. 
Song and Dance. 
Cunning little fairy, 
So beautiful and airy, 
Is my darling roguish Cora 
With her hair of golden hue ; 
Of my love I'm ever thinking, 
Yet it is beyond the speaking, 
Though I 
thoroughly adore her, 
But of her I 
will tell you. 
CnoRUS 
My roguish Cora, 
How I 
adore her, 
With her none can compare: 
My heart she cloth bother, 
rn ne'er love another, 
Cora with the golden hair. 
She's as plump as can be, 
Blue eyes with which she scans me, 
Has my darling roguish Cora, 
With her hair of gulden hue. 
She confessed that she did love me, 
And then said that she would wed me, 
When I 
told her I 
adored her, 
I 
was happy I 
tell you. 
My roguish Cora, & C. 
So a 
wedding there'll be, 
And we'll have guests o'er plenty.

With hair of golden hue; 
At St. Paul's church it will then be 
On the afternoon of Wednesday ; 
Do not wait then for another, 
For I 
now do invite you.

FALSE ALBERTINA. 
Writen and sung by ALBERT DE 
VOY. 
I 
fell in love with a 
nice young girl, 
While in a 
situation, 
She lived head cook at a 
large hotel, 
Near Shoreditch Railway Station, 
Slie vowed she loved me faithfully 
And that she would be mine, oh, 
And agreed with me to share her fate. 
I 
thought that very fine, oh. 
CHORUS. 
But she ran away with a 
Horse-guard Blue, 
I 
wish I 
ne'er had seen her, 
For I'm weeping and fin willing, and don't know what to 
do, 
For I've lost my Albertina. 
I 
bought her fine dresses and 
New bonnets shawl and laces, 
I 
treated her to Epsom Downs, 
To see the Derby Races. 
'Twas there she saw this Horse-guard Blue, 
Who asked her to take wine. oh, 
Then treated her to the Grand Stand, 
A wretched fate was mine, oh. 
But she ran away, &e. 
I 
began to see she slighted me, 
So I 
thought I'd go one morning, 
To her and have it all explained, 
But from me take a 
warning. 
For there upon the doorstep 
My rival he was standing, 
I 
flew into a 
dreadful rage. 
And satisfaction was demanding 
But she ran away, &c. 
My hat he then smashed o'er my eyes, 
And banged me left and right, sirs, 
A Bobby hard up for a 
job, 
lie collared me for the night, sirs, 
There may .plaps be some girl unwed, 
Who's lost her false young lover, 
And if she'll have me in his stead, 
We may console each other. 
But she ran away, &c.

THE ACTOR. 
Composed and sung by PATTIE STEWART. 
Ant--" Sam Brown the Raftsruan." 
My cognomen is Peter Brown, 
And Shakespeare's be n 
my aim, 
I've studied hard for twenty years, 
To ascend the ladder of fame. 
But hard luck seems to fo low me 
Wherever I 
have been, 
The folks call me a 
spotter 
Instead of a 
Tragedian. 
Spoken—Yes, I 
always felt as though I 
was born for the stage, 
for I 
never feel as happy as when playing the part of Othello, 
especially where he sa., 
s : Blood ! blood ! 
Ingo, blood !! 
CHORUS. 
For I'm the chap you've heord about, 
Peter Brown's my name, 
I 
kill some fellow every night, 
And do it all for fame. 
There was Richard the 3d, Old England's King, 
The wickedest man in town, 
He murdered friends and kindred, 
In order to reach the crown. 
And when he tried to sleep at night, 
Their Ghosts all would appear, 
With hideous yells and dying groans, 
Making him wake with fear. 
Spoken—Bind up my wounds, and give me another horse. 
A 
horse! a 
horse ! ! 
My Kingdom for a 
horse! 
For I 
am the chap, dze. 
Macbeth comes next upon the list, 
A 
verse on him I'll sing, 
He murdered Duncan and his friends, 
And then they made him King. 
And when he gave a 
grand banquet, 
WI ere sparkling wines did flow, 
The Ghost of Bangrm did appear, 
And made him tremble so. 
Spoken—Avaunt, and quit me sight! let the earth hide! thy 
bones are marrowless! thy blood is cold I 
thou hast no specula,

For I

I AM SAD TO NIGHT. 
Music by 3. M. WELLER. 
Sung by ALICE DUNNING LINGARIL 
Let me sing a 
song of the olden time, 
Let me dream a 
dream of the past, 
While the stars are bright in their golden light. 
And the night shades are gatlering fast, 
I 
would weave a 
chaplet of cypress leaves, 
And gem it with cypress flowers, 
And crown the grave where the wild flowers wave, 
O'er the friend of my happier hews. 
CIIORUS. 
I 
am sad to- night, though the stars are bright, 
And my cheeks have lost their hue, 
For mem'ry brings on her raven wings, 
Sad dreams of the fallen true. 
For inenfry brings on her raven wings, 
Sad dreams of the fallen true. 
Sad echoes are floating upon the air, 
Tlie wind is sobbing a-loud, 
And the daisy and violet blooming sweet, 
Are my brave soldier's only shroud, 
But I'll weave a 
chaplet of cypress leaves, 
And gem it with cypress flowers, 
And stars are bright, in their golden light, 
And the night shades are gath'ring fast. 
I 
am sad to-night, though the stars are bright, 
And my cheeks have lost their hue. 
For mem'ry brings on her raven wings, 
Sad dreams of the fallen true. 
For menfry brings on ber raven wings, 
Sad dreams of the fallen true. 
ELLA IS MY STYLE. 
As I 
travel around this town, 
And gaze upon the fashion, 
I 
always see in merry glee 
The pretty girls so dashing ; 
And as I 
get around them, 
They greet me with a 
smile, 
But none among them pleases me, 
For Ella is my style. 
CHORUS. 
To see her you'd confess, 
She is so gayly dressed, 
She's my sweetness, she's my peach, 
When on me she throws a 
smile; 
There is no one to match her, 
For Ella is my style. 
The first time that I 
met her, 
It was at a 
promenade, 
The moon was shining brightly, 
T'was then I 
made a 
raid. 
I 
asked her quite politely 
If I 
might see her home; 
She smiled on me and took my arm, 
And then we walked along. 
To see her, Ore. 
I 
told her that I 
loved her, 
And married we would be ; 
So in our best we quickly dressed, 
The parson quick to see ; 
And now she's my darling little wife ; 
She greets me with a 
smile; 
There is no one to match her, 
For Ella is my style. 
To see her, etc.

I SHALL MEET HER.—[CONCLUDED.] 
You ought to see her feet when she walks along the street, 
She's a 
beauty if you take her altogether; 
She's a woman, I 
suppose, you can tell her by her clothes, 
In her hat she wears a 
pink and yellow feather.— Cho. 
She's very fond of fish, with pickles in a 
dish, 
She can eat a 
little floury hot potato; 
She likes a 
drop of stout, and she always looks about 
For a 
nobby little curly-headed waiter.—Cho. 
She's going to have a 
dance with a 
chap that came from France, 
At a 
ball that's given by a 
nobby master; 
And if I 
should longer stay, I 
shall hear the people say, 
The darling little creature I 
have lost her.—Cho. 
HOW TO CHOOSE A WIFE. 
THE bachelor leads a 
miserable life, 
Some folks that are wed no better: 
Yet a 
fellow may live happy with a 
good wife, 
But the question is " How shall I 
get her I" 
There are pretty good wives and pretty bad wives, 
And some wives worser than others: 
But as for those wives who scold all their lives, 
They are nothing but fuss, plagues and bothers. 
Some choose them a 
wife for ease or grace, 
Or a 
pretty, firm step while walking: 
Some choose a 
fine figure, some a fine face, 
Yet very few choose one for talking. 
Then to choose you a 
wife to join you through life, 
Choose one that can speak sincerely: 
Who, though not over nice can give advice, 
And love a 
good husband dearly. 
So now, young men, if to wedlock inclined, 
May deceit nor flirtation ne'er trap ye: 
May those who are single get wives to their mind, 
And those that are married be happy.

DI tell you of a 
loving youth, 
Who deep in love did fall, 
With a 
gushing maid of forty-five, 
Who was wrinkled, spare and tall. 
He used to play the double bass, 
And he was mad, you bet! 
When he found he had a 
rival 
Who played the clarionet. 
ClIORUS. 
Yes, they were a 
pretty pair, 
As ever yet was seen ; 
He'd play her gentle music 
On his double bass machine. 
They'd walk out in the moonlight, 
And love stories he'd relate, 
And serenade at evening, 
Or ' neath her window wait, 
But the clarion et 111 tl a 
was crafty, 
His hair was fiery red, 
lb made this damsel promise 
That only he she'd wed, 
Yes, they were, die, 
When the " Double Basser" heard this, 
It was an awful blow, 
It made him feel so very weak, 
lie couldn't hold his bow. 
He made his will that evening, 
On death he did decide, 
lie crawled into his double bass, 
And there he calmly died. 
Yes, they were, (..te 
The clarionet man was very triad, 
For now he'd claim his bride, 
He Mowed so hard that evening

Every night a

With spectacles on his face, 
Playing funeral marches 
On his ghostly double b:iss,

GET ALONG OLD MULE. 
0, the tune's done gone when massa used to say: 
Turn out, Pompey, at the break of day— 
Hurry down the hoe-cake and shoulder the hoe, 
And over the creek to the cane field go. 
For now I'm free as the bird in the air. 
This corn-patch is mine, and the little cabin there; 
And Chloe and the children all belong to me, 
And this child's happy as happy can be. 
Get along, old mule; touch him up, John— 
Corn is in the crib and chicken's in the stew. 
Get along, old mule, get along on, 
Plowing in the field where the sugar cane grew. 
Old driver came one night to my cabin door, 
Hungry and weary, faint and sore; 
Jenny brought him water while Kitty got a 
chair, 
And Chloe brought a 
corn-cake and gave it to him there 
And old rnassa's sorro‘ls have whisened o'er his head, 
All his loved ones are gone to the valley of the dead; 
They sleep where the honey- flower feeds the wild bee, 
Under the shade of the cotton- wood tree 
Get along, (tc. 
0, sad times are gone—may they never come again, 
For heavy was the trouble of the poor slave then ; 
Now I've money in the pocket, and plenty in the store, 
And what can a 
happy man ask for more? 
The days pass a-
.vay full of peace and delight, 
In the labors of the field or the dreams of the night. 
And sweets thoughts wander through my ev fling prayer. 
As the children kneel around the old man's chair, 
Get along, drc.

lie sank faint and hungry among- the famish'd brave, 
And they laid him sad and lonely within his nameless grave. 
CHORUS 
rTo more the bugle calls the weary one, 
Rest, noble spirit! in thy grave unknown ! 
I'll find you, and know yen, among the good and true, 
"When a 
robe of white is giv'n for the faded coat of blue. 
He cried—" Give me water and just a 
little crumb, 
And my mother she will bless you through all the years to come; 
Oh tell my sweet sister, so gentle, good and true, 
That I'll meet her up in heaven, in my faded coat of blue." 
No more the bugle calls, &c. 
He said—" Mv 
d. ,ar comrades, you cannot take me home, 
But you'll in irk my grave for mother, she'll find me if she'll come 
I 
fear she'll not know me, among the good and true, 
When I 
meet her up in hear'n in my faded coat of blue." 
No more the bugle calls, & e, 
Long, long years have vanished, and though he comes no more, 
Yet my heart will startling beat with each footfall at my door, 
I 
gaze o'er the hill where he waved a 
last adieu, — 
But no gallant lad I 
see, in his faded coat of blue. 
No more the bugle calls, & c. 
No sweet voice was there, breathing, soft a 
mother's prayer, 
But there's One who takes the brave and the true in tender care. 
No stone marks the sod o'er in 
lad so brave and true, 
In his lonely grave he sleeps, in his faded coat of blue. 
No more th- bugle calls the weary one, 
Rest, noble spirit! in thy grave unknown, 
I'll find yen. and know you, among the good and true, 
When a 
robe of white is giv'n for the faded coat of blue.

And those who always wrote, now write the more."

SO1G BOOKS, 
This series of " S )ngsters" is superior to any published. Each of these 
books is a 
real " Singer's LibrarY " in itself. 
They are handsomely printed, 
and strongly and prettily bound; are of the most handy shape and size. 
Each book contains about two hundred and fifty songs. And the very flower 
of the kind of songs to which it is allotted. 
Unusual care has been taken to 
search for every real good old song, as well as to obtain every first-rate new 
one. The most devoted lover of song can hardly recall a 
ballad that he will 
not find here in all its integrity—not a 
word added, not a 
word omitted. 
But 
not only is this series of books complete; they are likewise of marvellous 
cheapness. The DE 
Werr " FORGET-M E-NOT " SONGSTERS are really, truly, 
and unquestionably the best and cheapest song books ever offered to the public. 
Two HUNDRED AND FIFTY first-rate Songs—handsomely printed and 
finely bound—for FORTY CENTS a 
Volume.
