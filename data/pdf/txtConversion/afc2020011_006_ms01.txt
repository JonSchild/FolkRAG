Project Detail 
This project is supported by the Archie Green Fellowship of the American Folklife Center at the 
Library of Congress. 
The purpose of the Immigrant Women Artists Oral History Project is to examine the occupational 
folklife of first-generation immigrant women artists living in Oklahoma and the networks of 
support that allow them to pursue their vocations in a 
new environment. This series of interviews 
examines not only the cultural and occupational traditions that these artists nurture in straddling 
multiple cultural identities, but also the translation of an artist's occupational life between 
multiple cultural and physical spaces. 
Legal Status 
Scholarly use of the recordings and transcripts of the interview with M. Teresa Valero is

About M. Teresa Valero... 
Venezuela native M. Teresa Valero grew up in the town of Barquisimeto, part of a 
very creative, 
artistic family. At the age of twelve, she began to learn printing and graphic design by creating 
invitations and announcements for local family events. At eighteen, she went to work with an 
advertising agency in town, and at the suggestion of her boss, she moved to the United States to 
study graphic design. She attended the University of Kansas (KU) and studied under illustrator 
Tom Allen, and she had opportunities to learn from well-known visiting designers and 
illustrators such as Milton Glaser, Alan Cober, and Hermann Zap£ She completed her double-
major bachelor's degrees in graphic design and art history and then continued on to earn a 
master's degree in art history. The graduate work allowed Valero to study with renowned curator 
Thomas Southall, and this sparked a 
passion in her to explore further into photography. After 
KU, she moved to Tulsa, and in 1989 she went to work at the University of Tulsa (TU), teaching 
graphic design. 
Consistently focused on student success, she created the student-run Third Floor Design, where 
students provide pro bono graphic design work for nonprofit organizations, giving back to the 
community while gaining hands-on, practical experience. Valero worked her way up from 
adjunct to applied professor, and she always thoughtfully brought her Venezuelan flavor into the 
classroom to expose her students to outside cultures. Over the years, she worked extensively not 
only with TU but also in her community and has received countless awards in recognition, 
including the Harwelden Liddy K. Doenges Individual Award, the Governor's Arts in Education 
Award, the YWCA 
Pinnacle Woman of the Year Award, and TU's Ms. Homecoming Award, to 
name just a 
few. Third Floor Design has been recognized on multiple occasions for its work 
within the community, as well, including the Eddy Award from the Tulsa Advertising 
Federation, and the John L. Everitt Non-Profit Award from Tulsa's Arts and Humanities 
Council. 
After thirty-one years at TU, Valero retired in 2020 but has continued working in photography 
and graphic design. In her interview, she described what she loved about teaching, specifically at 
TU, and she shared the importance of keeping students engaged while learning remotely during 
COVID quarantine. She explained what subjects capture her eye for photography, and she shared 
her future plans, post-retirement.

Little Thunder 
This is Julie Pearson-Little Thunder with the Oklahoma Oral History 
Research Program at Oklahoma State University. Today is April 2, 2021, 
and this is a 
remote interview with Teresa Valero for the Library cf 
Congress' OcciApational Folkl fe Prcject funded by the Archie Green 
Fellowship. We are both in Tulsa. Teresa, you're a 
graphic designer and 
photographer, a 
former prcfessor at the University cf Tulsa, and someone 
who has individually and institutionally spent a 
lot c 
f 
years advocating for 
more inclusionary cultural scene here. I 
look forward to learning more 
about you and your work. 
Valero 
Thank you, Julie. Thank you for having me. 
Little Thunder 
Where were you born, and where did you spend your childhood? 
Valero 
I 
was born in Venezuela. My hometown is called Barquisimeto. It's well-
known for arts and crafts, but it's also the musical capital of the country. A 
lot of musicians come from that area. 
Little Thunder 
How cool. 
Valero 
I 
grew up in a 
family of a 
lot of artists. I 
had a 
brother who was a 
film 
director and one who was a 
poet and a 
writer, a 
sister who was an art critic. 
Art was a 
topic of conversation in our table. 
Little Thunder 
It sounds like the spine cf the family. 
Valero 
Yeah, right. At a 
very early age, I 
became a "graphic designer." I 
used to do 
all the invitations for baptisms, first communion, quinceaneras in my town. 
I 
learned about the printing process very early on. I 
was about....

Little Thunder 
Valero 
How old? 
I 
was twelve when I 
started, and I 
did it until I 
was around fifteen years old, 
sixteen or seventeen years old, yeah. It taught me the value of doing design 
but also being rewarded for it. You know, I 
do this "job," and I 
will get paid 
for it. I 
think very early on I 
learned the worth of what I 
was doing and how 
people, if they wanted to have it, they should pay. 
That is so neat. So you basically sort cf knew you were on a 
career path, 
sort cf, when you were that young. 
Yeah, very early on. It really focused me on doing things in order to achieve 
what I 
wanted to achieve, and that's what I 
think eventually brought me to 
the United States. I 
started working in an advertising agency in my 
hometown, in Barquisimeto. I 
must have been eighteen or nineteen years 
old. I 
had not gone to college. My boss kept on saying, "You need to get a 
degree. You need to get a 
degree in graphic design." That's what initially 
brought me to the United States. I 
came to the University of Kansas and 
studied graphic design. Somewhere in the middle, I 
fell in love with art 
history, so I 
decided to double major. I 
got both a 
BFA in graphic design 
and a 
BA in art history. 
And how did you choose the University cf Kansas? 
I 
went to study with a 
very well-known, at the time, illustrator called Tom 
Allen. He was brought by the Hallmark Company, the Hallmark cards, to be 
an endowed professor at the University of Kansas. He truly revamped the 
whole program both in design and in illustration, so there were, like, those 
two tracks. You could go into graphic design, or you could go into 
illustration. It was exciting because he brought a 
lot of his friends and 
colleagues from all over the state. Milton Glaser, the well-known designer, 
visited Kansas maybe four or five times on my tenure there. Don Trousdell, 
who was a 
big advertising guy, very important from Atlanta, he came. Alan 
Cober, he was a 
well-known illustrator, he also came there. The list goes on 
and on, people who did illustration, who did design, who did design 
typography. We had Hermann Zap£ Is a 
well-known type designer, and he 
came to KU 
twice. 
What a 
great time to be there. 
Yeah, it was great. I 
finished my undergrad. Then I 
got interested in doing a 
master's in art history, so I 
went on and did my masters at KU. I 
wanted to 
5 
study with an art historian who did seventeenth-century Dutch art. Then I 
wanted to study with a 
professor in photography (Tom Southall), a 
curator 
in photography who studied with Beaumont Newhall, who was the first 
photo curator at the Museum of Modern Art.

Little Thunder 
Valero 
And that was really your first exploration cf 
photography... 
Yeah, right. 
... at the graduate level. 
Yeah, so I 
actually took photographs but also was interested in the history of 
photography. 
So what happened c 
fter you lc ft KU? 
My husband got a 
job here in Tulsa, and so I 
knew through my teachers and 
mentors that Tulsa was a 
wonderful town. I 
first worked at an advertising 
agency for about two years, but the bug of teaching was killing me because, 
as a 
graduate student at KU, I 
taught. I 
saw a 
job opening at the University 
of Tulsa, an adjunct position to teach graphic design. Stephen Sumner was 
the person that first hired me, (he was the director of the School of Art at the 
time) and, as they say, the rest is history. I 
was hired in ' 89 as an adjunct, 
and then I 
became a 
visiting professor full-time. Then I 
became an applied 
professor. I 
just retired, emerita... 
Congratulations. 
... after thirty-one years at TU, and what a 
wonderful career. 
You also got involved early on with the Tulsa Photography Collective. Can 
you talk about that event? 
Yeah, yeah, they used to have their exhibits in a 
small photo place that used 
to be on Fiftieth Street. That's where I 
met some of the art faculty and some 
of my friends from the Photo Collective. That became a 
lifelong friendship. 
The photo collective is long gone, but I 
still have friendships with them. 
Photo Collective was exciting because it was a 
group of people all interested 
in photography, and all wanted to bring important names to town and have 
workshops. We all spoke and belong to the same tribe, you know? We spoke 
the same language. [Among my friends: Chuck and Annie Tomlins and 
Charlie Johnson.] 
Little Thunder 
Right, and you had access to a 
dark room and materials that way.

Valero 
Little Thunder

[00:10:19] 
Little Thunder 
Valero 
Little Thunder 
Valero 
Yeah, yeah. 
That's very exciting. So cfter you got to TU—you know, college 
demographics aren't really representative cf the country, cf course, and 
then private school demographics probably even less so. I 
know they are 
less so, so I'm wondering how you worked as a 
prcfessor to make your 
classes more inclusive. 
The sheer fact that I 
have a 
diverse background, that I 
come from another 
country, that bring my culture into the classroom, that I 
speak differently, 
you know, I 
think that made them aware of other cultures and being 
sensitive. I 
think some of the students that I 
recruited, whether they were 
Latin American or Hispanic background, African Americans, or Native 
Americans, they all said that that was something that they felt a 
kinship, you 
know, that they had a 
person that was of a 
diverse background and could 
understand them, okay? That's really important because I 
always try to 
remind them of the world outside the one that we were living in, that we're 
not the same. We are different, and we should relish those differences, right? 
Right. 
We should celebrate them. One thing that I 
heard again and again from the 
students is that they always felt part of the class and that we were a 
community. That was really important, that sense of, kind of, family. 
Because we are a 
small university, the University of Tulsa, you really can 
attend to their individual needs. 
Yeah, that's so, so important. What do you strive to teach when you're 
teaching graphic design? What do you strive to communicate to your 
students? 
I 
have to quote this prolific writer in graphic design. His name is Steven 
Heller. He wrote a 
book called Citizen Designer, and the citizen designer is 
the person that uses their abilities, their qualities, to make a 
better world. 
Yes, we're doing graphic design, which is a "commercial profession," but 
we're doing design with that conscious that good design is good citizenship, 
that you make it for the better of the product or the client or the community. 
Another thing that I 
teach is, I 
want the students to get involved in their 
communities, whatever place they might be, because by giving back to the 
community, their community is better, right? You can have your job but 
then look for a 
nonprofit that needs you and then be part of it. It's very 
rewarding after teaching all these years that I 
see my students on boards 
across the city and across the country.

Valero

Valero 
Little Thunder 
You also spoke to me a 
little bit about the layers that are involved in graphic 
design. Do you mind talking about those a 
little bit? 
The layers? Remind me. 
I 
don't know, maybe the clients' need but also these other considerations. 
Oh, well, you know, sometimes people do design because they're thinking 
of their portfolios and they're not thinking of what their needs are. I 
think 
what I 
teach is, first and foremost the client and their needs come first. You 
want to be proud of the work you do. How design is layered, in a 
sense, 
what do we take first, second, and third. That's what makes good design, 
okay? If it's a 
poster, is it the image or the headline? How does the viewer 
digest that information, and how can they recall other images or other ideas 
as they discover the piece? 
Yeah, that seems like it makes pei fect sense. You mentioned that c 
fter all 
these years cf teaching, you can usually tell when students get into the 
program, which ones are going to succeed and which ones won't. What are 
some c 
f 
the signs that you look for? 
Well, that that ideaI should preface this by saying the students have 
changed over the years. When I 
started thirty-some years ago, they were 
doing their degrees, but they really didn't have that goal and that purpose. 
More and more you see the studentsI was the exception at the time I 
went 
to school there (I 
had two degrees) because usually people just did one 
degree and that was it. Nowadays, the students want to have several degrees, 
and they want to achieve this and that. Before, it was like, "Okay, I'm going 
to get my art degree, and I'm not quite sure what I'm going to do with it." 
What I 
see now is that carrot at the end of the road. They know that if they 
take these classes, they will be better prepared at the end. They have really 
clear ideas what they're going to do after graduation. One thing that I 
think 
is that they're driven, and the other thing is they have a 
plan. Some of them 
are really resourceful. They do their degrees in design, and they say, 
"Graphic design is not for me." They have the tools to decide, "I'm going to 
teach in the public school," or, "I'm going to go into marketing or 
advertising," because the way we structure the program is that we give them 
the fine arts background mixed with motion design, print design, web 
design. Then they have the basis of art history. In many occasions, our 
students in graphic design do a 
minor in advertising. You know, you have 
your education in the liberal arts, and you pretty much can do anything you 
want.

Little Thunder 
Valero 
[00:18:46] 
Little Thunder 
Valero 
Right, right, we've been arguing for that. (Laughs) 
Yeah, yeah. 
TU has the Alexandre Hogue Gallery, which is named 
for a 
famous artist 
and former prc fessor there, and you oversaw that gallery as part c 
f 
your 
duties. How did you approach that? 
Well, the gallery has a 
committee. They set, like, the show. We have set 
shows that come annually, like our student jewelry exhibition, and then we 
have the graduate students, MFA or MA, shows. Then we have also the 
senior shows. Those are always there. Each faculty that brings an artist, they 
basically curate the show, set up the workshops, and all that. I 
have to give a 
lot of credit to the faculty. They have a 
vision. They know what is best for 
the area. We have a 
biannual, which is called the Mayo Visiting Artists 
[series], so we bring a 
painter of notable stature to work with the students to 
have an exhibition. It also provides an opportunity for our designers to 
design all the collateral material, whether it's a 
catalog or the invitations, 
etcetera. 
And you did bring in Sarah Ahmad who's also an immigrant woman artist. 
Yes, yeah, we were so pleased. You know, this is how life works. Sarah had 
that exhibit ready. The committee wanted her to apply, and, of course, they 
accepted her. The beautiful thing about her show that it was so invigorating 
and so moving that it was the show that welcomed the students back to 
school last August 2020, at a 
time that the students were feeling, you know, 
so isolated and they had to do their classes remote. It was a 
good thing to 
have her show and to feel... since you could immerse yourself. You could do 
it at night, and you could do it during the day. I 
heard again and again from 
the students, "It made me feel so good to walk through the gallery or to be 
there and enjoy Sarah's show." We're thankful to Sarah. 
Yes, a 
wonderful moment during the pandemic. To go back to your advice to 
your students, which is, you know, you have to be in and cf your community, 
too, and you need to be thinking, f 
you have a 
job, what kind cf nonprcfit 
can you work with. You started a 
program there called Third Floor Design, 
I 
believe. Do you want to tell us how you got the idea for it and what the 
goals were? 
So Third Floor came—it's not a 
new idea. Many universities have it. In fact, 
KU had a 
similar program called The Arts that sadly is no longer in place. I 
9 
came to the university in ' 89, and I 
approached Steve Sumner. I 
said, "I 
would like to do this," because what I 
was seeing is that we can teach all the 
skills and all the theory in the classroom, but when the students were going 
to do their outside internship, what we call the corporate internship, they 
were not as prepared. We created Third Floor as this stepping-stone for the 
students to be better prepared for the corporate internship. At the same time, 
we thought we will be a 
partner to all these nonprofit organizations who 
don't have the funds to pay a 
designer. It's, like, symbiotic. It's a 
mutual and 
reciprocal good connection for each other. They need a 
designer; we needed 
the experience. What came out of it that I 
didn't foresee is the citizen 
designer, the person who wants to give to the community and wants to be 
part of it. 
[00:20:44] 
They learn everything. They learn what Big Brothers and Sisters are doing. 
They learn what the YWCA, all the arts organizations and museums. It's 
quite touching to see that in twenty-eight years we have served seven states 
and Panama internationally, that we have served more than 250 agencies or 
nonprofit organizations, and that we have about, oh, I 
don't know, maybe 
170 students go through that internship. It is not a 
given. A 
student that 
comes for graphic design, they have to have a 
portfolio to be selected and 
then their class performance because, as I 
tell them, they're not just 
representing themselves, but they're representing the University of Tulsa. 
You want them to be responsible and attentive to their client needs. Out of 
all the students who have gone, we have 100 percent placement and 100 
percent placement in their graduate school they wanted to go on. We really 
prepare them for that step beyond TU. 
Little Thunder 
[00:22:42] 
Valero 
That is very impressive. Well, you yoursef have been involved in a 
lot cf 
civic organizations on a 
lot cf deferent, you know, both as a 
board member, 
and... volunteer. What are some cf the challenges cf being on nonprofit 
boards? 
It really depends on the organization. There are some that are very large, and 
so you don't have the hands-on, you know, part that some of the little ones 
require. I 
think that the challenges that we had lately (I've sat in several 
boards) is going through the pandemic and approving funding to an endless 
number of fine and performing arts organizations who need the funding. I 
think what I 
see by going through all of these panels and selecting 
organizations.... My 
hat's off to all the organization leaders who do it pro 
bono and who spend all their time and energy doing the work because they 
just love the organization. It is really hard for a 
small organization if people 
are not on top of things, you know, meeting deadlines or understanding how 
10 
a 
grant is written. Art people are learning, but they haven't been known for 
understanding the importance of the economic impact that the arts make, 
and understanding the numbers. We're beginning to have people that are 
really in tune with that, especially in this day and age in which the arts seem 
to be, you know, under fire. You know, the fundings are cut for art 
programs. I'm so thankful that we have in Tulsa, for example, the Tulsa 
Artist Fellowship because that has been such a 
shot in the arm to bring all 
these artists and performing artists and writers to Tulsa. 
Little Thunder 
Valero 
[00:25:11] 
Little Thunder 
Valero 
Yeah, it's been a 
huge blessing. 
It's also a 
great lesson for our students who have been working. Some are 
doing internships. Some are being hired and getting paid to be a 
studio 
assistant, and they can see at firsthand what it means to be a 
full-time artist. 
What a 
great lesson to learn. 
Oh, yeah, invaluable. You've also curated a 
number cf shows. What are the 
challenges to curating a 
show? 
Well, I 
think it's always hard, rejection, when you're not accepted into a 
show. I 
think some people take it better than others. (Laughter) That's a 
challenge. When you have a 
visionI can think of A 
Woman's Place Is In 
the World, which is an exhibit I 
curated many years ago, or Little Black 
Dress, which was an exhibit I 
curated, both at the Hogue Gallery. You don't 
want to be cyclical because there is no way to be cyclical, but you want to 
highlight the important points of the theme. For the Little Black Dress, I 
wanted to have a 
variety of media, and so I 
picked a 
filmmaker, a 
photographer, textile, two or three textiles, ceramics people, printmakers, 
etcetera. What unified was the little black dress, but their interpretations 
were so wonderful and so encompassing, what it means for a 
person to wear 
that, for a 
woman to wear the little black dress. 
I 
had a 
poet write a 
poem, and it was read. I 
had a 
musician write a 
piece for 
the show which was performed that evening. I 
had artists such as Anita 
Fields and Shan Goshorn, Anna Norberg, Carol Haralson, Janet Shipley 
Hawks. I 
mean the list goes on, Marsha Moore Hughes, a 
painter. Yeah, it 
was really great. The night was like a 
Fellini movie evening, (Laughter) all 
these little black dresses walking into the Hogue Gallery, and we created a 
mural of all the women. We took pictures, and we just installed them right 
there, celebrating not just the little black dress but womanhood. I 
always talk 
about, as women, we're weavers. We love to kind of connect each other, and 
we're not about the hierarchy, okay? We're very much on the horizontal 
band. That was a 
really fun show, and I 
had people saying, "Are we going to

have part two?" (Laughter) The dresses for the inspiration were Connie 
Cronley's dresses, Connie Cronley the writer. 
Oh, yes, right, right. 
We based the work on her dresses. 
Oh, wow, what a 
great— I 
wish I 
had seen that one. I 
missed that one 
somehow. Maybe I 
was in grad school. I 
don't know. You've won a 
lot cf 
honors and awards both for your, you know, graphic design work, for your 
service work, for your board work. What are one or two cf the most 
memorable for you? 
Well, I 
think receiving the state [Arts in Education Award], the governor's 
award, meant the world to me because it recognizes the teaching and the 
involvement I 
had for the last thirty years in the community. I 
came to 
Tulsa, and Tulsa became my home. I'm so proud of being here and living 
here for all these years. I 
might not sound like from Oklahoma, but I 
really 
feel that I 
am an Oklahoman from way, way south. 
That's right. (Laughs) 
I 
think the governor's award meant the world to me. I 
think the teaching 
awards that I 
got from the university because that's the recognition from the 
students. The students are the ones who nominate you. Every single award I 
have received is punctuating a 
time in my life or in a 
community. I've 
received a 
Pinnacle Award. Third Floor Design received awards, as well, for 
the pro bono work we've done. We receive a 
Harwelden [Liddy K. Doenges 
Individual] Award which is, you know, very touching. We received an Eddy 
Award, which is given by the Tulsa Advertising Federation, and it's given to 
someone who helps their advertising and design community. That award 
goes to the students. They're the ones who do the work, right? 
Right. Well, photography's been like one cf the mainstays cf your personal 
artwork. What interests you in terms cf sul ject matter or approach? 
Definitely people and places. As a 
documentary photographer, I'm looking 
always for that human condition commentary on a 
culture, and also because 
of who I 
am, I 
want that connection with people. I 
want to learn about them 
even when I 
don't speak their language, and I 
want to become their friends, 
someone that they think is part of their community. There are specific 
images in the documentary work of The Levant (Lebanon and Syria through 
12 
Western Eyes] that I 
can think really stay with me, you know. The project 
started because I 
photographed the window of the house where my husband 
was born in Lebanon. There is a 
kind of torn window, kind of looking all.... 
I 
decided that day when I 
was in that little town that I 
will start a 
journal or a 
document of images of my travels to Lebanon and Syria because I 
want to 
bring him those images. 
[00:32:35] 
Little Thunder 
He wasn't with you. 
Valero 
No, he wasn't with me, yeah. Then I 
started just going more deliberately to 
places and meeting people. There is a 
lady sifting wheat, and I 
spend a 
whole afternoon with her and a 
translator. She talked about drying the 
wheat, putting it all in the top roof and getting the sun in the summer so that 
they could have it for the winter. What a 
hard life she had, but in a 
way she 
was very thankful for all the experiences. Then looking at the young men 
herding sheep, you know, that's another image. Working in a 
little town in 
Lebanon and turning and finding this beautiful blue door that made me think 
of TU, so I 
call it the TU door, that intense blue that you see in the Middle 
East houses. Yeah, traveling and making connections with people and 
learning about others because this is something that goes back to my 
upbringing. My grandfather was Italian, and he was an immigrant. 
He came to Venezuela, actually, through Ellis Island all the way to South 
America, okay? I 
always tell and advise my students, "If you have an 
opportunity to study abroad, you do that. Why do you do that? You will not 
only learn about that culture, but you will learn about yourself and your 
culture. You will learn to appreciate what you have." Again and again, 
many, many times the students told me, "That was the best thing I 
ever 
could have done. I 
learned so much about myself, but it made me realize that 
we have a 
wonderful country," or, "I'm so lucky to have what I 
have," 
etcetera. Yeah, people need to travel because when you know more about 
the world, you're less afraid and maybe less judgmental of others, right? 
[00:35:06] 
Little Thunder 
Absolutely. Well, they're fabulous photographs, all cf them. I 
just love being 
able to look at them. I 
know that you've kept in touch with these people and 
that both Syria and Lebanon have just been through some wrenching crises. 
Valero 
Yes. 
Little Thunder 
I 
wondered how that impacts you emotionally and how it impacts the 
friendships that you've forged.

[00:38:20] 
Well, some of the places I 
photograph that you're seeing in the presentation 
are long gone. They're rubble now. Aleppo, which is one of the most 
beautiful cities in.... Damascus is beautiful, but I 
have a 
special affinity for 
Aleppo. It's very progressive and environmentally aware and beautiful art. 
Aleppo was completely destroyed, and it's a 
very sad state how Syria is 
now. Some of my friends are gone, you know, yeah. I 
hope to travel again, 
but not only because of the pandemic, but it hasn't been safe to travel there 
for some time. I 
hope to go back and continue to photograph. 
Right, oh, I 
hope so, too. I'd love to see that work. What kinds (-f  
stereotypes 
or misconceptions have you encountered in Oklahoma or Tulsa as a 
woman, 
you know, originally horn in Venezuela, now an Oklahoman? 
I 
think they're becoming better, but there are certain things that kind of stick 
in my mind. There is a 
stereotype that all Latins are dark skin, dark hair. 
When I 
speak, they said, "Are you from Germany," which cracks me up 
because my thick Latin accent, you know. The assumption that you don't 
fully understand the language because you have an accent. Some people are 
really very welcoming and generally curious. "Tell me where you're from." 
Misinformation, I 
think. Americans are not well known for knowing their 
geography. (Laughter) I 
had one time a 
person, "I 
know where Venezuela 
is," and they told me Africa. I 
said, "Well, similar shape continent but not 
quite." (Laughter) Yeah, that's primarily, you know.... It really surprised me 
that it was the color of the skin what really threw them off because I'm light 
skin and light hair. 
Little Thunder 
You've had to deal with the pandemic in multiple ways. How did it G
.) fect 
your teaching? 
Valero 
Oh, my goodness. I've been telling this story, but no one has heard, so I'm 
going to tell it again. On March 10, 2020, the university went completely 
remote. We were three days away from spring break, and the students were 
going to go home, etcetera. Then everythingI have never taught anything 
remote in my 
life, never recorded a 
lecture or anything or a 
demo. I 
stayed 
in the department until the thirteenth, making sure the students had their art 
supplies and they could take everything home, etcetera. Then I 
had a 
crash 
course on Zoom, Harvey, and everything else so that I 
could teach 
everything remotely. It was really hard. I 
did it. The thing that really, you 
know, got me down was the students miss the class. They miss their friends. 
They miss the interaction. That could not be replaced. 
No matter how good you're doing in your Zoom and your Harvey and your 
whatever, Collaborate, the human contact and the human interaction cannot 
be replaced. The fact that the students—it was hard. It was very hard on 
14 
them. Actually, I 
think I 
worked twice as hard to make sure that they were 
okay, not just getting the information but mentally, because they said they 
were down. It was like, oh, so many hours sitting in front of the computer, 
etcetera, and that was really hard on them. You become a 
little bit not just 
the teacher but kind of like the counselor and the mom, too, which is a 
name 
the students have given me, Design Mom. The thing is that when you teach, 
you care so deeply for your students, and you want to make sure they 
succeed and they do well.

Little Thunder 
Valero 
Yeah, you have mentioned that you continue to keep close tabs on your 
students... 
Yeah, yeah. 
... who graduated years and years ago. 
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
Why is that important to you? 
Well, I 
think because I 
don't have any other family, immediate family, here 
in Oklahoma, really TU and my students have become my family. I 
was 
well-known for giving them Venezuelan breakfast. When we finished Third 
Floor Design, they came to my home, and I 
made a 
complete meal for them. 
We sat and talked, and we kept in touch. Actually, once we can travel, I'm 
going to go and visit a 
few of my former students. They're in Oregon and 
San Diego and Houston. I 
hope to go and see them. Some of them have 
already retired. This is how old I 
am. (Laughter) Some of my students that 
graduated retired from their jobs. 
That'll be wonderful... 
Yeah. 
... to be able to go make those visits. Are there any specs fic prc 
jects that you 
are looking forward to, post pandemic or post-retirement here? 
I'm trying to—well, I 
really would like to go back to Lebanon and Syria to 
photograph, but I 
don't know when that will happen. That project is pretty 
much on hold. I 
want to switch gears, but I 
haven't even given it a 
second 
thought. It's just an initial idea that I 
want to do something that is more 
hand-related, okay, rather than machine-related. I 
want to do something with 
15 
my hands. I 
think being around 108 Contemporary, the gallery in downtown, 
has really sparked that desire because we bring a 
lot of wonderful artists to 
Tulsa, local and also at the national level. I'm thinking I 
want to make 
something with my hands. What I'm going to make, I 
have no idea. I 
haven't even thought that far, but I 
think I 
want to make something, 
something that would take me lots of time so I 
can sit down and be in that 
zone, you know, how craft artists talk about. You know, it's really 
interesting. Most people want to ask the craft artist, "How long did it take 
you," but that's not something that is important. What is important is the 
process, and how you feel, and how it makes you be in that zone while 
you're doing it. 
[00:43:59] 
Little Thunder 
Absolutely, oh, that sounds great. (Laughter) 
Valero 
Yeah, and time for yourself, you know. For so many years, being the 
director, being the creative director for Third Floor, you're in that conveyor 
belt. You're running. You have meetings. You have deadlines. You have to 
solve problems. It's kind of nice to be, you know, dedicated to my house 
and downsizing and thinking of projects but not feeling the pressure that I 
have to do it here and now. It's something that is going to happen, but I'll 
find the right moment to immerse myself again into my work and my 
creativity. 
Little Thunder 
Right, right. Was there anything we forgot to talk about, Teresa, that you'd 
like to mention or bring iAp? 
Valero 
Oh, I 
think you've been very thorough, Julie. I 
think we covered pretty 
much everything. 
Little Thunder 
Well, I'm looking forward to your future whatever you make by hand and 
photographs, and 
just seeing you post pandemic will be wonderful. 
Valero 
Oh, yeah, I 
really like the blanket that you have in the background. 
Little Thunder 
Oh, thank you. Yeah, it's a 
kind c 
f 
an antique, and it makes it much prettier 
backdrop than my wooden door. (Laughs) 
Valero 
I 
know that's why I 
have my painting here, same reason. 
Little Thunder 
Well placed. All right, well thank you for your time today, Teresa. 
Valero 
Thank you, Julie. It's been wonderful. Good to see you. 
Little Thunder 
Good to see you.
