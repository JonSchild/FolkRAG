Dear Mother,
 
Here is the clipping I promised to send you.
 I
'm going to
 
se e
 i
f I can find her book, and if i
t looks good, I
'll bring i
t
 
to  Guadaloupe.
 
I also promised to write out One Pig Fat Hen.  Here i
t is:
 
One big fat hen.
 
Two ducks
 
Three plump partridges
 
Four sca—reaming wild geese
 
Five limerick oysters
 
Six bones from a Macedonian horse
 
Seven sailing ships sailing from Orinoco to Madagascar on Prince
 
Kilgore's wedding day
 
Eight elegant elephants embarking for Europe
 
Nine nimble noblemen nonchalantly nibbling nonpareils
 
Ten tipsy tailors timidly teasing a terrified titmouse
 
Eleven Corinthian columns careening cautiously, closely contiguous
 
to the covered catacombs of a Catholic convent
 
Twelve thirsty thespians thriftily thumbing through thirty
 
thousand theological theses
 
(
Somehow it seems like the thirsty thespians should be Thirteen,
 
but I can't think of any other lines)
 
This is the way that I recall it.
 I think Nick and I disagree on
 
a couple of the longer ones; I think he embellished them, poet
 
that he is, but it may be EZ faulty memory.
 
I don't suppose you got a chance to see much of the
 
Democratic Convention.
 I had no intention of watching i
t but
 
tuned in to see Ann Richards' speech on opening night, because i
t
 
had been given such a good anticipatory write—up in the paper
 
(
supposed to be lots of Texas—style humor), and ended up watching
 
all three nights.
 I caught all the best speeches: hers,
 
Kennedy's, Jackson's and Dukakis'.
 It certainly seemed like they
 
can't  lose.  We taped Jesse Jackson's speech, because Noah had
 
to go to bed and he wanted to hear it.
 It was a real corker and
 
we'd be glad to share it with you if you missed it.
 I was
 
especially pleased that Noah was able to hear it -
 it was a
 
chance for him to see and understand something of the Civil
 
Rights movement, to hear a real orator, and to learn about lew 4L a-r
i
'v
 
many people actually live in this country but with a hopeful and
 
prideful slant rather than just doom and gloom and sadness.
 
I tried Corey but there was no answer.  Maybe we'll see you
 
this weekend, but consider carefully whether you really want to
 
make that long drive over to Lowell and back.  After all, you
 
have been to several festivals already in the past months.  We
 
are all "psyched," as the kids are fond of saying, about
 
Guadaloupe.  Amanda has started the countdown -
 14 days today.
 
Enjoy yourself, and do get some relaxation i
n as well  as
 
exercise.
 
Love from us all,

Learned from Susan B
oyer Haley
 
5113 8th Terrace South
 
Birmingham, Alabama  35212
 
205/591-5188
 
This song came from her great grandfather, George Sullivan who came from Ireland
 
(
she doesn't know the county) to North Freedom, Wisconsin where he l
ived in a
 
tent.  His area i
s still known as Sullivan's Pocket.  He was a fiddler and
 
lived to be 96 years old.  Susan learned the s
ong directly from her mother,
 
Janet Broyer of Kirkwood, Missouri.  Mrs. Kirkwood always sang "Watch my honey's
 
fingers as she picks upon the strings".  Susans husband is a banjo player, so
 
she sings "he picks upon the strings".  She is an artist-in-schools worker
 
in northern Alabama where she s
ings her family's repertoire (
parlor songs and
 
Irish music hall and general Anglo balladry -
 a nice mix) with guitar accompaniment
 
and axim dulcimer.  She's an interesting mix between folk and folky; does a
 
l
imberjack as well.  She says this is the childrens' favorite song.
 
Well, first they made the earth
 
And then they made the sky
 
And then they made the c
louds s
o white
 
And hung '
em there to dry.
 
And then they made the moon and stars
 
From pretty baby's eyes
 
To give the people l
ight
 
When the sun she didn't rise.
 
Walkee in the parlor, boys
 
Walkee 1kz in, I say,
 
Walkee in the parlor, boys,
 
And hear the banjos play.
 
Walkee in the parlr, boys
 
And hear the banjos ring
 
And watch my honey's fingers
 
As he picks upon the strings.
 
Well, then they made the big sea
 
And then they made the whale
 
And then they made the l
ittle coon
 
With a ring around his tail.
 
And then they made the e
lephant
 
So very big and stout
 
But the critter wasn't satisfied
 
Until he had a snout.
 (
CHORUS)
 
Well, then they took old Adama
 
They laid him on the ground
 
They gave him a dose of laudanum
 
To make him sleep so sound.
 
And then they took a rib
 
Right out of Adam's side
 
And they gave him a pretty Irish girl
 
To be his blushing bride.
 CHORUS)

Greetings, y'all, from the N.Y. Pinewoods Folk Music Club here on
 
tbrt other coast.  Ac the local round-singing fanatic, I
'm always
 
tn'terested in learning new rounds (or unfamiliar old ones) for use at
 
round table"-gatherings.
 
Here are some nice ones I've collectedj pick your o w n  convenient
 
fey.  (
I'm sorry that I don't know most of the composers).  And if s o ni
 
of you out there share my m ani a,  please -do send me some non-standard
 
favorites of yours, and maybe we c a n  exchange many more.  Write tot
 
Sol Webe , 25-14 37th Street, Astoria NY 11103.
 
To start with, here's "Mister Bach," the delightful take-off on the
 
Little Fugue in G Nino
