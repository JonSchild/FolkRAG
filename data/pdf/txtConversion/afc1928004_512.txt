There's a

Beside the area gate.

The man who carries letters, 
A 
certain Mister Flynn, 
lie hollers in the area, 
"Is Mary Daley in?" 
it makes me aggravated, 
To see her drop a 
plate, 
And smile upon the postman, 
Who meets her at the gate. 
She's a 
duck, etc. 
The iceman and the butcher, 
The baker with his bread; 
The plumber and the glazier, 
Have nearly turned my head; 
A dreamy undertaker 
Has finished me complate, 
He marries her next Sunday 
We close the area gate.

Why to the club, my dear, of course,

But when in his coat you find a

I 
am stopping at a 
house 
Kept by Mrs. Doyle, 
The rules and regulations 
Are ferninst us all the while: 
Three meals a 
day we get, 
We sit down in a 
line; 
Every man in bed at eight, 
Or locked out after nine. 
CHORUS. 
There's Slattery McGonnigle, 
Gilligan and Dan O'Burke; 
A Scandinavian fisherman, 
A Norwegian and a 
Turk. 
Two ladies and a 
child, 
That's christened " Baby Mine," 
Every man in bed at eight, 
Or locked out after nine. 
At the six-day walking match 
held at Madison Square, 
The boarders all determined 
In a 
body to go there; 
They shouted hip, hurray, 
O'Leary walked so fine; 
Murphy's watch it stopped at eight. 
We got home after nine.

For Mrs. Doyle did roar. 
They woke the neighbors up, 
The tailor, Rubenstein, 
Sayed:" Talk avay, my Irish friend, 
You're locked out after nine." 
There was a 
row next day, 
With all the boarders drunk; 
Miss Doyle she got excited, 
And she threw out every trunk. 
Hat boxes and \-alisel, 
The shirts from off the line, 
Came out with all the boarders, 
'Cause they were out after nine.

Written and composed by G-. W. HUNT. , 
THEY tell me I 
am too bashful by far, 
L',nd sometimes I 
think they are right, 
But s‘) awfully naughty the masculines are, 
No wonder one feels in a 
fright; 
I've been led to believe men were born to deceive, 
So when they their compliments pay, 
In language absurd, I 
don't hear a 
word, 
But first as a 
caution I 
say: 
• 
ChOTHS. 
Go away, get along, go along, get away, 
You don't say what you mean, or mean what you 
say; 
Go away, naughty bov, go ever so far, 
You are so awfully awful, you are. 
Go away, get alon,c_f. go along, get away, 
You don't say what von mean, or mean what yoh

You are so ZIW T

uwful, you are. 
When I 
go to a 
ball and one asks me to dance, 
At the finish I 
soon slip away, 
For I 
know Mr. Noodle. if he has the chance, 
Is sure to have something to say; 
So I 
stop the sad man as soon as I 
can, 
In case he'd lie goino• too far, 
Perhaps what he'd tell inc he has told two or threes. 
For such sad Don Giovannis they are, 
Go away, etc. 
I 
dread Christmas time whenCer it comes 'round, 
'Tho' it's awfully jolly, I 
know, 
But so many young men, again and again, 
Lead me under the mistletoe:

Oh! would you believe, on last Christmas eve, 
I 
found a 
young man at my feet, 
With a

mansion and carriage, 
Of course I 
soon beat a 
retreat.

THE FINE IRISH GENTS. 
Sung by JOHN PowEns. 
IT'S a 
shame on the stage how they mimic our race, 
in a 
style that's a 
mystery to me, 
How the people in front will stand such insult, 
Receiving such blockheads with glee. 
If they went to old Ireland they'd find their mis-
take, 
For our boys and our girls are well dressed; 
In manners as well to you I 
will tell, 
For they stand in the land with the best. 
Chorus. 
'For in singing and dancing and all kinds of sport, 
And if ever to Ireland you \vent, 
From their heads to their toes they all wear decent 
clothes, 
I 
speak of a 
true Irish gent. 
Sure, they make up their faces and look just like 
fools, 
And they walk like a 
dog with three legs; 
If they went to old Ireland to show them such 
sport, 
They'd be pelted with stones and bad eggs; 
For it's there you'll find ladies and gentlemen, too, 
Educated, kind-hearted and true, 
And I 
hope for to see that little isle free, 
And the green with the red, white and blue.

DAYS GONE BY. 
W ords by P.

DOWNEY. Sung by Jr= 
YouTict. 
THE times are very hard, my friends, 
And getting worse each day; 
A young man's chance is just as slim 
As he that's old and grey. 
Now when I 
think of old times, 
It almost makes me cry; 
For an honest man could live with ease, 
In days done by. 
Chorus. 
If then a 
man was needy, 
A helping hand was nigh; 
For the people lived in barmy, 
In days gone by. 
When I 
was young the boys were not 
Afraid to take a 
glass; 
We would have a 
tight between ourselves, 
And that would quickly pass. 
But now with knives and pistols, 
Oh! my, it makes me sigh; 
For we never carried things like them, 
In days gone by. 
If then a 
man, eta. 
When I 
was but a 
little boy, 
Oh! what a 
change since then; 
Our government was then ruled by 
The very best of men. 
We 
all lived gay and happy, 
tell the reason why: 
Then men were for the country's good 
In days gone by. 
If then a

My mother now is resting calm, 
In the graveyard on the hill, 
But her kind words come back to me, 
And haunt my memory still;

'Twas because I 
heard the warning words: 
Don't drink, my boy, to-night. 
I've often roamed, etc. 
I've now passed down the road of life, 
And soon my race is run, 
A 
mother's warning listened to 
has saved her loving son; 
Thy words will stop the morning cup, 
And revelry at night,

I

Dear old friends, jolly old friends, 
Clinging together in all sorts o' weather. 
Dear old friends, jolly old friends. 
Give me the friendship of dear old friends. 
We've tasted of the ups of life, we've also felt its 
downs; 
Sometimes our pockets were quite full, but some-
time fortune frowns; 
And be our drink bright, sparkling wine, or simply

The grasp of friendship is the same through each 
succeeding year.

Dear old friends, etc.

In a 
conscience clear, a 
heart that's light, with dear

DON'T TAKE ANY NOTICE. 
Written and sung by BEN DODGE. 
While out in the country last Summer I 
wedded, 
A 
blushiu.z young damsel whom I 
thought sublime, 
Immediately after we moved to the city, 
Where we have lived happy the most of the time ; 
Until last Friday night my homestead I 
entered, 
I 
saw there a 
young man, nineteen if a 
day, 
And as I 
gazed at him completely bewildered; 
The wife of my besom unto me did say— 
CHORES. 
Don't take any notice, it's only my cousin, 
Don't let a 
small matter like this one annoy ; 
Now don't get excited, it's only my cousin, 
You mustn't mind Willie—he's only a 
boy. 
at first was disposed to think light of the matter, 
And cordially weleound him then to my plave 
But his low vulgar actions, and quite greedy manners. 
Drove the bright smile of welcome away from my 
face. 
For when we were all gathered round our supper table, 
The choicest of dishes he soon stowed away; 
To keep down my anger I 
was quite unable, 
But my wife stopped my growling, and to me did 
say : 
Don't take any notice, etc. 
My wife with her cousin was very much smitten, 
At least so it seemed by her actions that night, 
rot the called him " 
Dear W illie" in tones Tery tender, 
DON'T TAKE ANY NOTICE. 
Continued. 
Now I 
ask any married man if it was right, 
When the clock on the mantle struck the hour of 
eleven, 
She kissed him good night ere he went to his bed, 
I 
sprang to my feet in a 
horrible passion, 
But my wife only laughed as she quietly said: 
Don't take any notice, etc, 
Next evening as I 
was from labor returning, 
A 
friend told me something which addled my brain, 
My wife and her cOusin bad " sloped" from the city, 
He'd seen them buy tickets and leave on the train. 
I 
rushed to the house, at the door met the servant, 
The truth of the statement I 
read in her face, 
My wit.: had shook me for her clear Cousin Willie, 
She'd left her fond husband to live in disgrace. 
SroRrN.—After my friend had given me the unwel-
come information I 
rushed frantically home. 
The door 
was locked : with one tremendous kick I 
burst it open 
The servant girl met me in the hall and said, '5 
Good 
Heavens, Mr. Dodge ! what is the matter ?" 
I 
asked 
for my wife; she told me the madam had only gone 
out for a 
short walk. (Even the servants were con-
spiring- 
against me.) 
I 
hurried up stairs to our bed-
chamber. 
There upon the dressing-case lay a 
note ad-
dressed to me. 
I 
quickly picked it 
up, tore it open, 
and there plainly written I 
read— 
Don't take any notice, etc.

PROM THE LIMERICK SIDE OF THE RHINE. 
Written by Jim J. 
NELSON, and sung with tremendous success by 
SHEEHAN t.t. JONES. 
Good-evening to ye's one and all, we're glad for to 
see ye's well, 
We thought on ye we'd make a call, our history for 
to tell; 
We landed here from Ireland, two Celts of high de-
gree, 
Such men as us ye'll seldom find, Pat Lynch and Con 
Magee. 
CHORUS. 
For the girls remark as we go past they say we are 
divine, 
They can't resist this darling pair, from the Limerick 
side of the Rhine. 
We walk the streets with stately tread, like Dukes 
and Lords of fame, 
And if we make the ladies sigh, sure we're not at all 
to blame, 
We wear fine clothes as you can see, no common 
stock we know, 
We're recognized as men of means wherever we may 
For the girls, etc. 
We sometimes condescend to go to a 
party or a 
ball, 
Although exertion suits us not, we sometimes make a 
call, 
On all the solid men of town, and the big bugs of the 
land, 
Our company they always seek, for our style it is 
great and grand. 
For the girls, etc. 
We never pay no heed to what the hoodlums may cry 
out, 
But still if they persist in gab, for a policeman we'll 
shout, • 
And then we'll give them in his charge, we've done 
so many a 
tune, 
We'll teach them not to guy this pair from the Lim-
erick side of the Rhine.

The clouds that rest on the mountain's breast 
Are kissed by the viewless air, 
And the western breeze kisses the trees, 
And woos the Ilow'rets fair; 
And the weeping willows are kissed by the 
billows, 
The day-star kisses the sea, 
Then why not, fairest, loveliest, dearest, 
Give a 
kiss to me. 
Chorus. 
The birds in their nests have all gone to rest? 
Kiss'd good- night in sweet ecstasy, 
Then why not, fairest, loveliest, dearest, 
Give a 
kiss to me. 
The clear bright moonbeam kisses the see, 
The hill and the peaceful dale, 
And the rosy bower at even's hour, 
Is woo'd by the nightingale; 
And the rose so red in its thorny bed, 
Is kiss'd by the forest bee, 
Then why not, fairest, loveliest, dearest, 
Give a

AM: Jessie, the Ftower of Dumblara. 
The flag is unfolded in glorious splendor, 
And Erin's brave heroes will flock to the seenel;'4,

For dear to ea di Irishman's heart is the Island 
That -.

And thowands will spring from the lowland..and 
higidand, 
From base British rule their fair country to free. 
Oh! where is the man that would court degradation, 
Contented to live 'math a 
foreigner's rule; 
And, deaf to the cry of his down- trodden nation, 
Si' L 
and become a 
gross tyrant's base tool? 
The Green nag of Ireland floats proudly bofore us, 
And gladdens the heart of each valiant son, 
The " Sunburst of Freedom" now shines brightly o'er 
us, 
Nor sinks in the west till the brave work is done. 
Then arouse, Sons of Erin, and strike for your Free-
dom, 
Old Ireland's awake to her cbin,ger and need, 
Her sons should be ready, for soon she will need 
them, 
Bright laurels await ye for each gallant deed. 
The time is at hand when each man should be ready, 
And Britain no longer will dare make a 
stand; 
With hearts true as 
teel, and with hands sure and 
steady, 
The Green Flag. of Ireland will wave o'er our land.

shadows of night were coming down swift, 
knd the dazzling snow lay drift on drift, • 
A_s through a 
village a 
youth did go, 
searing a 
flag with this motto: 
" 
Higher." 
Over a 
forehead high, curled copious hair, 
This nose was Roman, complexion -fair; 
Over an eagle eye an auburn lash, 
And loud he kept talking through his mustache: 
" 
Higher." 
He saw through the windows as he kept climbing 
"upper," 
A number of families just sitting to their supper; 
But he eyed the slippery rocks very keen, 
And fled as he cried, and cried while a &chi': 
" _Higher." 
"Look out, you there," said an old woman, "stop! 
Its blowing great gales up there on the top; 
You'll tumble off on the other side  
But loud the hurrying stranger replied: 
" 
Higher." 
"Oh, don't go up such a 
shocking night, 
Come, sleep in my lap," said a 
maiden bright: 
On his Roman nose a 
tear- drop come; 
Still, he replied, as upward he " dumb:" 
" 
higher." 
"HIGHER." Continued. 
" 
Look out for the branch of that sycamore tree; 
Dodge the rolling stones if any you see;" 
Saying which the farmer went home to bed, 
And a 
voice replied (far overhead:) 
About a 
quarter past six the next afternoon, 
A man accidentally going up soon, 
heard overhead as often as twice, 
That very same word, in a, very weak voice: 
"./fifAik, 
And not very far I 
believe from a 
quarter of ,,cevert, 
(II. vas 
long time getting lip the road was so 
unoven,) 
Fdittia the stranor demi in the drifted snow, 
Still " clutching " the flag with this motto: 
Yes, lifeless, defunct; without; any doubt. 
That lamp of his being decidedly gone out, 
On the dreary hillside that youth was laving, 
And there was no more use for him to be saying: 
"

IIITS ON TIIE TIMES. 
As sung by FRANK LEWIS at Irving Hall, N. Y. 
IIElifs my latest batch of telegrams that's come 
o'er land. and sea, 
From the snow-clad hills of Greenland to the fields 
of Tennessee; 
There's some very funny incidents transpiring 
every day, 
And which I'll tell you in my song, but don't you 
give them away. 
We've had some lawsuits in this, our glorious 
town, 
But the strangest one that I 
have heard, and the 
latest going 'round: 
-Count JOalllICS, he has lately sued our Sothern for 
damage done, 
Because as a 
crushed. tragedian, he the Count's 
great fame has won. 
Our ex-president, now in Europe, is in that land 
across the sea, 
lie treads upon a 
foreign shore, so gallant and so 
free; 
Whether Russia or old Turkey in their struggle 
may be right, 
Our General Grant, the soldier bold, can show 
them how to fight. 
T ,
AIE 
HITS ON THE TIMES. 
Continued. 
Some did not like him as a 
president, but this 
much we can say: 
That he did iris duty nobly in the thickest of the 
fray; 
God bless him on his journey, for he is a 
warrior 
brave, 
And well he fought in days gone by, our country's 
flag to save. 
We're having strange scenes in our courts4 a 
ease 
occurred last week, 
Where two fathers tried, at the same time, a 
little 
girl to seek; 
Now I 
know there's many children who do not 
their fathers know, 
But one to have two at a 
time is a 
curious thing 
to show. 
Still I'm glad she's not lost to the stage, but give 
her genius scope, 
She'll become, like Clara Morris, the people's pride 
and hope; 
I'm sure that in the future Mabel Leonard will be 
seen— 
The brilliant actress of her day, upon the stage a 
queen.

ISN'T A DOLLAR ENOITeill TO 243T 
BREAD, AND WATER COSTS NOTHING 
AT ALL. 
An original song by FnAxx LEwis, written for ELL=tr 
-W OODSON. 
In the city of Brooklyn is living 
A 
man, who himself once was poor. 
But that fact it would seem he's forgotten, 
Or he'd act very different, I'm surer 
Now I 
heard, on a 
late Sunday morning, 
These, words from his saintly lips fall: 
"Isn't a 
dollar enough to buy bread? 
And water costs nothing at all." 
Chorus. 
Then no man will I 
count in the list of my friends, 
Who is deaf to the workingman's call; 
And says: " A 
dollar is enough to buy bread, 
And water costs nothing at all." 
This wonderful preacher don't do much. 
Tho' he lives on the fat of the land, 
He has all that he wants—maybe too much, 
For he lives in a 
style that is grand; 
Yet this clerical and cheeky old fraud said: 
(Though two thousand a 
month is his pay,) 
That a 
workman should be very happy, 
On only a 
dollar a 
day. 
Then no man, etc. 
This man is not known for his good deeds, 
Though for "gab" the world over he's famed, 
He preaches to please his rich patrons, 
And thereby has gained a 
great name; 
But I'd much rather be a 
poor workman, 
When before judgment's seat we all stand, 
Than to be in the shoes of Ward Beecher, 
Who went back on the poor laboriugman. 
Then no man, estg.

Oh! no, I'll never see him more, 
Since thus he likes to roam, 
And when his team stops at the door, 
I'll say I'm not at home; 
He smiled last night when Julia smiled. 
They must have met before, 
If thus by her he is beguiled, 
I'll never see him more; 
If thus by her he is beguiled, 
I'll never see hini more, 
No more, no more, no more. 
This ring, his gift, I 
will return, 
It makes my finger sore, 
Anthill his letters I 
will burn, 
And trample on the floor; 
his sonnet that my album graced, 
My tears shall blot it o'er. 
The leaves together I 
will paste, 
And ne'er behold it more; 
The leaves together I 
will paste, 
And ne'er behold it more, 
No more, no more, no more. 
I'll waltz and flirt with Charley G., 
Though voted oft a 
bore, 
I'll show him that my heart is free, 
And sigh for him no more; - 
If we should meet his eye shall Shrink, 
My scornful glance before, 
hark! that's his ring, here, Jane, 
I 
think I'll see him just once more;

Fondly we•dreamed of the days so soon to be!

You ask him to drive von around the town and

rooster is off his nut."

OFF YOUR NUT.

Now friends, if you'll take my advice, it may do 
you some good, 
I

Don't drink too much, or stay out nights, or you 
never will have any luck, 
You'll ruin yourself both cash and health, and go

Oh, ONCE I was as gay 
As a

Who's perch'd upon an apple tree, 
Or down amongst the corn.

For my love has left a 
hole in it, 
Oh, where's Rosanna gone.

Some say she's hid away,

And our glir)sts shall come and frighten her Dad 
Behind the kitchen door.

Mary Ann she makes the most 
At crying out old hats, 
Sometimes my wife she makes -a

Her thing to sell is door mats—door mats; 
My Louise she is a 
tease, 
The boys say she's a 
beat, 
Rie makes so much, I 
don't know how, 
Upon that Bowery street. 
Sometimes I 
have to get a 
club, 
And stand down by the door, 
But if I 
go too near that crowd 
They smash out at my jaw; 
The other night I 
heard a 
noise, 
From loafers, I've no doubt, 
" 
Oh, John—oh, John 1" my wife she cried, 
" 
Get up and put them out." 
Mary Ann she makes, eto. 
By jingo, but the doctors say 
My wife has got a

MEMOIRS OF THE STAGE. 
Written by Wm. R. WATTs, and sung all over America, by 
CHAS. H. DUNCAN. 
N the bright annals of the stage, 
Some great men we have lost, 
Who now have left the footlights' glare, 
To another land have crossed. 
Edwin Adams we shall see 110 more, 
From us he's passed away, 
Nor Burton, with his merry laugh, 
The drunken Toodles play. 
We'll smile no more at G. L. Fox, 
And gone from us afar, 
Is the one we loved above them all, 
Old Uncle Ben DeBar. 
E. L. Davenport has passed away, 
Yet his fame I 
will recall ; 
Such men will never be forgot, 
And I 
wish good luck to all. 
Where are the merry minstrels gone, 
Who in the days past by, 
Di:I make you laugh throughout the night, 
When fi'led with mirth and joy ? 
Wher,3's Budworth with his banjo string, 
And Unsworth in his speech, 
George Christy who when at the end, 
None could in fun outreach. 
Continued. 
Where is the man so great and tall, 
To every one a 
friend, Billy Manning ci 
Greatest of them all, 
Alas, he met his end. 
Where is Dan Bryant, whom you loved ? 
On him no more you'll call, 
Such men will never be forgot, 
And I 
wish good luck to all. 
Matilda Heron, bright Camille, 
45 Has crossed the unknown shore. 
And Lucille Western, once our pride, 
Has gone forever more. 
Great Charlotte Cushman disappeared, 
And we can mourn our loss. 
Sweet Laura Keene has pass'cl away, 
The dark dread gulf has cross'd. 
Such women in my early days, 
I 
loved to see them play, 
And watched them tread the mimic stage, 
In hours now passed away. 
thought the angels were so bright, 
Till they from life did fall ; 
They yet in memory hold a 
place, 
And I 
wish Good luck to all.

The young people all made a

They placed him high up in the corner; 
Then at him they went, dear, with hearts light and gay, 
And danced the night hours into the young day,

AIR:—Never Give '1st to a 
Stingy Way. 
I'm married a 
V 
ear and to me it's five, 
I 
am an unlucky man; 
I 
thought if I'd marry, a 
fortune I'd_ make, 
For I'd live on the saving plan; 
My wife has a 
mother and father too, 
Aly thiirs melt away like ice, 
But if I 
interfere I'll get hit in the ear, 
Kind people, of me take advice. 
Chorus. 
Never go near to your mother-in-law, 
Keep out of her way, my man; 
She might make a 
slip between cup and a 
lip, 
But she'll not make a 
slip with her hand. 
My neighbor, a 
peddler, who lives up above, 
He's nearly as bad as me; 
His wife is a 
German from sweet Skiberreen, 
Of relations she has twenty-three; 
A 
few nights an, boys, he made a 
mistake, 
And very near lost his life, . 
He got into bed with his mother-in-law, 
Instead of to bed with his wife. 
Never go near, etc. 
Johnny, my boy, how's the child to-day? 
The neighbors around me cry, 
The truth I 
will tell, he is not very well, 
If they don't let him be he'll die. 
This morning at daybreak, quite unawares, 
I 
was jerked out of bed on the floor, 
My wife said she wanted to take the child, 
And so did my mother-in-law. 
Never go near, etc.

My amity lives, you know, 
She has a

And how I 
blushed, I 
know, 
For what a 
fool I 
must have looked 
, As Joe stood there below. 
However, he soon aot me down, 
And no more I'll climb a

And many a 
day TI1 recollect 
The kiss that Joe gave me.

IRISH JOKES. 
An Irishman, Eip.;lishman, and Frenchman met one 
day, 
and each began to relate how great they were. 
Johnny Bull said as he was walking through Rotten Row 
London, the people would take off their hats and bow to him 
taking him for Gladstone. 
Frenchy then began and said : As I was walking in Paris 
the people would take off their hats and say ben soir, and tak 
me for Napoleon. 
Paddy then began and said : Do you know as I 
was walking 
through Sackett St , Dublin, the people would take off thei 
hats and say : Jesus Christ, how are you ? 
An Irish gentleman went to call on Dr. Carr to attend a sick 
child. 
It was midnight when he arrived at the doctor's. 
Ile 
rang the bell once, then twice. 
No response, 
The third time, 
the doctor looked out of the window and asked what was wan-
ted, in an angry voice 
The Irish gent said : 
"Miss de Carr." 
" 
Whut !" the doctor replies. 
" 
Miss de Car again," he says. 
The doctor replies : 
'• What do I 
care ; wait for another Car(r) ; they run every 
half hour—closed the window and retired. 
There . 
was nothing but a 
plain slab at the head of the mound, 
but the simple inscription upon it tells it's own sad story : "lie 
was an umpire in a 
close game." 
A wag who thought to have a 
joke at the expense of an Irish 
provision dealer, said : " Can you supply me with a yard of 
pork ?" " Pat," said the dealer to his assistant, " give the 
gentleman three pig's feet." 
Cesar had his Brutus, Charles 
his Cromwell, and why 
shouldn't Bridget have her every otlipr Sunday ?
