[Letter from John A. Lomax to Mr. Broome, San Angelo]
Port Aransas, Texas March 26, 1939
Dear Mr. Broome : San Angelo:
Since wri r t ing you I have found that the Washington affair is to be a supposedly
unpublicized event at the White House, the songs favorites of the President: HOME ON
THE RANGE, GOOBYE OLD PAINT, THE CHISHOLM TRAIL, GIT A LONG LITTLE
DOGIES, etc. I suppose you can get the entire list in ample time.
I did not expect you to answer me definitely. In fact, I wrote to two other groups and also
asked them if it were possible for them to go. My plan was to get all the information in,
send it on, and let Washington choose. As the matter stands I am going to recommend
your crowd and leave the further negotiations to be made direct between you and them.
May I say that I have a feeling that they want more singing and less guitar picking?-at least
to subordinate the instruments to the voices.
Now another matter: You remember that my recordings stopped abruptly when you fell
sick during my former visit. The Library of Congress wants more records of cowboy singing
by amateurs, as nearly as possible now in the style used by the old range riders. Could
you help me again? My machine is to be here soon and I am to be on the road again. I
could come some time convenient to you in the next month or so. If there are singers other
than your group, I could take my machine anywhere to get any particular sing. Understand,
please, that the Library wants a record of near cowboy singing even if the music is printed
in my new and revised COWBOY SONGS, or in any other book of western stuff.
As for Washington, go ahead with your practicing. That's an uncertain atmosphere, as you
know. I'm leaving it up to them.
