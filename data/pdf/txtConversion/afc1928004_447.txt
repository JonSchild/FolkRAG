This Red Head of Mine. 
Written by CHAS. DOCKSTADER, and sung only by Miss FANNIE BEANE. 
fra- 1.-ly own with 
leasure 
That I 
have a 
charming beau, 
lie's my idol and my treasure, 
And the dearest one I 
know. 
With brighter light than stars above 
He says my blue eye:; shine, 
But then I 
know he's deep 
love 
With this red head of mine. 
CHORUS. 
He dotes upon my singing, 
My voice with laughter ringing ; 
He says my form is faultless, 
And my dancing is divine, 
To love me I 
have taught him, 
Oft he wonders how I 
caught him 
But the secret I 
will tell you— 
'Twas this red head of mine. 
Though I 
try my best to please him, 
To be jeah)us he's inclined, 
He says I 
like to tease him 
just to hear him speak his mind, 
I'm shortly to become his wife, 
None can my joy define, 
For I 
know ' twill be his pride through life, 
This little head of mine. 
He dotes upon, Sce, 
Simpson's Alley Gate. 
Written expressly for FANNIE BEP NE as a 
companion to " Grimes Cellar 
Door," by CHARLES DOCKSTADER. 
As I 
came down the street to- day 
I 
saw some girls and boys 
Playing tag and hide and seek, 
And shouting loud with joys. 
It took me back to long ago, 
In old New Hampshire State, 
When brother Ike and I 
would swing 
On Simpson's alley gate. 
CHORUS. 
Oh yes, you bet we had good times 
In old New Hampshire State, 
When brother Ike and I 
would swing 
On Simpson's alley gate. 
Now, Billy hikes came down one day, 
To play with me and Ike, 
But when we swung him on the gate 
His clothe.; caught on a 
spike, 
lie tore his coat and trousers, too ; 
When he got home ' twas late, 
His father swore at me and Ike 
And Simpson's alley gate. 
Now, my old dad sent me one day 
For something at the store, 
But I 
fell clown and hurt my nose, 
And made it awful sore. 
I 
hookey play2d from school next 
And sold my book and slate, 
My dad has walloped me right goc;d 
'Cause he caught me on that gate. 
Oh yes, you bet, & c. 
Written by CHARLES DOCKSTADER for CHARLES GILDAY. 
I'm in love with a 
charming little lady, 
And her hand to me she give. 
She's the belle and I 
am the swell 
On the street where we do live. 
I 
met her singing in an alley 
On Emancipation Day ; 
How de do and how are you 
Is all that we did say ; oh, 
Sophia is her name, (Symph.) 
She's gentle, kind and lame. (Symph.) 
CHORUS. 
Her voice is like de breeze of summer, 
AS 
soft and gentle as a 
dove ; 
Over yonder we will wander, 
And soon I'll have to go. 
I 
took Sophia out a 
walking, 
She liked to kill the niggers dead. 
She had roses, yellow posies, 
On the top of her black head. 
Oh, set all the bells a 
ringing, 
We're going to have a 
happy time; 
There be dancing niggers prancing 
On the day that gal am mine.

tlossoms on Your Nose. 
Couple from Old Tyrone. 
Written by CH,NS, DOCKSTADER for FANNIE BEANE and CHAS, G1LDAY. 
We are an Irish couple, and 
We came here from Tyrone ; 
It's many a 
year since we came here, 
In a 
ship across the foam. 
For it's twenty years ago, friends, since 
N'Ve landed on your shore, 
And we left behind friends good and kind, 
And them we'll see no more. 
CHORUS. 
The ups and downs of life we've seen, 
The dark days and the bright •, 
With poverty we've struggled hard, 
At last our hearts grew light. 
For Dame Fortune smiled upon us, 
And lent us a 
helping hand; 
Sure we blessed the day we came away 
Fro n 
dear old Ireland. 
We have children two to cheer our lives, 
And make our old hearts glad ; 
Sure you should see the girl we have, 
And the handsome fine big lad. 
For a 
blessing they have been to us. 
And happy is our home ; 
Von should call and see, when you have the time, 
The couple from old Tyrone. 
The ups and downs, &c. 
As sung by CHARLES GILDAY. 
Good evening, how do you do? 
I'm not very well myself. 
I 
haven't had a 
drink to- day, 
Because I 
hadn't the wealth. 
I 
asked the bartender for a 
drink, 
Now what do you suppose? 
He kicked me out into the street, 
'Cause I 
had blossoms on my nose. 
CHORUS. 
Blossoms on your nose, 
Now what do you suppose? 
He kicked me out into the street, 
'Cause I 
had blossoms on my nose. 
Going down the street to-day, 
I 
met a 
friend of mine ; 
He asked me for to have a 
drink, 
Of course I 
did decline. 
The bartender put on airs, 
And called me a 
galaot; 
" 
Get out," says he, " you're a 
bummer, I 
see, 
With blossoms on your snoot." 
Blossoms on your snoot, &c. 
Winnie Clair. 
Written for Miss BFANE b) W ILLIAM E. McNta.Tv. 
Sung only by Miss BEAN!. 
In the summer time, when the vespers' chime 
Over hill and dale was pealing, 
In a 
quiet nook, by a 
babbling brook, 
I 
first met Winnie Clair. 
With his curly hair played the fragrant air, 
And the sun's bright rays were beaming, 
Playing hide and seek with his dimpled cheek, 
Oh, it made him wondrous fair 
CHORUS. 
Free from care, 
Rich and rare, 
[Break.] 
[Break.] 
Was my darling little handsome Winnie Clair, 
In the summer time, & c. 
Over hill and dale, through a 
grassy vale, 
Arm in arm we then went straying. 
As I 
neared my gate, I 
then knew my fate 
Was a 
future bright and fair, 
For I 
answered " Yes" 
To his slight caress, 
And a 
blush my love revealing, 
I 
am now his wife, yes, his for life, 
And he calls me Winnie Clair. 
Free from care, & c. 
The Old Log Hut. 
Down by the river the log hut stands, 
There father and mother once dwelt, 
The old door latch that was worn by our hands, 
And the church where in prayer we knelt; 
Years, years have passed since that happy time, 
But the river keeps rolling along, 
Its rippling sound on the mossy bank 
Is singing the same old song. 
CHORUS. 
Row, row, row your boat 
Gently down the stream ; 
All that's passed is gone, you know, 
The future's but a 
dream. 
[Repeat Chorus.] 
There stands the tree we used to climb, 
And the mill with its rolling din, 
'rue old wharf boat we used to float, 
And the school boys used to swim. 
High grass grows on our master's grave, 
But the river keeps rolling along, 
The birds, the bees, the flowers and trees 
\ Are singing that same old song. 
10 
Topics of the Day. 
As sung by Miss Lt.71..t W ENTWORTH with great f;UCCCSS, 
'I is of a 
subject new I'm going to sing to you, 
Please give me your attention now I 
pray ; 
It's about the Silver Bill and whose pockets it will fill, 
Just listen now to what I'm going to say. 
Hard money at last has got the bill to pass, 
But to good old honest greenbacks we should cling. 
President Hayes made a 
veto, but he found it was a 
go, 
That shows that he's not solid with the ring. 
CHORUS. 
What does Congress mean to do to let such bills pas.; through? 
When they know our nation's debt we've got to pay. 
I 
thought it was but right to mention here to- night 
Some of the leading topics of the day. 
There's the Chinese question too,at Congress has pass'd through, 
There's enough of heathens in the Golden State ; 
Now fifty pounds, I 
am told, they have to pay in gold, 
Before they'll be allowed to emigrate ; 
No more they'll wash the dirt from our collars, cuffs and shirts, 
We want no Chinese laundries in our land ; 
But still there's one thing more should be banished from our 
That's Sitting Bull and his bloodthirsty band. 
Lshore, 
What does Congress mean, & c. 
There's little Jimmy Blame, from away down East in Maine, 
lie knows he's dealing with a 
lot of loons, 
And Ben Butler he is great, both his eyes are getting straight, 
l 
le's looking out for some more silver spoons. 
Bob Ingersoll as well is telling us of hell, 
And Beecher giving lectures on the same ; 
Pm sure they'll meet there, for of sin they've done their share, 
And the devil on them both has got a 
claim. 
CHORUS. 
What does Plymouth mean to do if what Elizabeth says is true ; 
They'NT expelled her from the church, the papers said, 
I 
thought it was but right to mention here to-night 
Some of the leading topics of the day.

When Antrim Tints the lavas with Goiti. 
Written expressly for FANNIE BEANE, by W M. E. 
MeNut.T‘4. 
When Autumn tints the leaves with gold, 
And Summer roses die, 
Ant. Winter winds blow fierce and cold, 
And daisies scattered lie ; 
"My sweetheart's in another clime, 
Safe in his arms I'll be, 
The bells will toll our wedding chimes, 
And bring new joys to me. 
CHORUS. 
Ring, ring, ye merry chiming bells, 
Loud let your joyous echoes swell. 
Then flee away, ye present hours, 
With pleasures still untold, 
And bring again those happy hours 
When Autumn tints the leaves with gold. 
(Break.) 
(Break.) 
We'll wander through the falling leaves, 
Across the russet plain, 
And down among the golden sheaves 
We'll talk of love again. 
Our lives will be like happy flowers, 
From care and troubles free ; 
Then flee away, ye present hours, 
And bring my love to me. 
Ring, ring, &c.

The Pride of the National Guard. 
Written by W ILLIAM E. 
MCNULTY, and sung originally by Miss BEAtot 
Through crowdea streets, with music sweet, 
We march, the blue and gray ; 
Our rank and file by beauties' smile 
Is greeted all the way. 
With upright head and marshal tread 
We have but one regard— 
To gain the name and win the fame 
As the pride of the National Guard. 
Shoulder to shoulder we gaily march along, 
Gallant in peace and brave in war, 
Singing the chorus of this our marching song, 
While echos repeat it near and far. 
CHORUS. 
Banners streaming, bayonets-gleaming. 
Hearts all free from fear; 
Cannons flashing. sabres clashing. 
To defend those we hold dear •, 
Horses prancing, gaily dancing 
On the grassy sward, 
The first on hand to save our land 
Is the pride of the National Guard. 
When order fled and riot's dread 
Was spread on every side, 
And ruffian bands, with ruthless hands, 
Our country's laws defied, 
'Mid blazing train and bullets' rain, 
Though danger pressed us hard, 
We fought for right and gained the fight, 
Did the pride of the National Guard. 
Ilanners streaming, ars,

Charming Little Lu. 
Sung only as a 
Song and Dance by:FANNIE BEANE. 
'Twas at a 
fancy ball at St. James' Hall, 
With the prettiest fellow in the nation, 
at once did go, thinking there to show 
My dancing skill, and gain his approbation, 
But, strange to say, I 
dared not dance, 
Nor could I 
leave my seat, 
Though poor dear Gussy came to me, 
And thus he did entreat : 
CITORUS. 
Charming little Lu, may I 
dance with you, 
In the mazy polka and the lanciers ? 
Charming little Lu, may I 
dance with you, 
And mingle with the merry, merry dancers ? 
When we left the ball, I 
then told him all 
Of my sad determination, 
And, like all the rest, I 
did try my best 
To keep down all his rash indignation. 
My hair- pins gone, my braids were loose, 
To (lance I 
did not dare ; 
My chignon surely would came off, 
And make the people stare. 
SPOKEN.—Of 
course when I 
informed Cuss)', dear, that 
was liable to lose all my back hair if I 
danced, he could not 
do otherwise than say— 
Clever little Lu, that was brave of you, 
Not to dance the polka or the lanciers,

Isn't He a 
Tease ! 
Sung only by Miss BEANE, as a 
Song and Dance. 
I've got a 
beau, a 
nice young man, 
As sweet as he can be ; 
He comes to see me twice a 
week, 
And dearly he loves me. 
He puts his arm around my waist, 
He likes my hand to f
-queeze, 
I 
really like the feeling, but 
He's such an awful tease. 
CHORUS. 
No matter what I 
do or say, 
He likes himself to please ; • 
So I 
always let him have his way, 
For he's such an awful tease. 
On leaving me last Sunday night, 
He kissed me sweet adieu, 
And although I 
know it was not right, 
I—well, I 
kissed him, too. 
I 
put my arms around his neck, 
I 
gave him such a 
squeeze ; 
Such happiness I 
dared not check, 
For he's such an awful tease. 
No matter what I 
do, 8.:c,

Dashing Little Fan. 
Written by CHAS. D OCKSTADER for, and sung with great success by, 
FANNIE BEANE. 
Now, girls may talk about their beaux, 
And happy days they've had, 
Of momenti spent in joy and bliss, 
And say they're never sad. 
But I 
have got a 
sweetheart, and 
He, whene'er he can, 
Tells me that he loves to call me 
Dashing little Fan. 
CHORUS. 
Dashing little Fan, (Break) 
And where'er I 
am, (Break) 
I'm happy as the day is long. 
And he, whene'er he can, 
Tells me that he loves to call me— 
(Jig)—(break.) 
Dashing little Fan. 
I'm happy when he's at my side, 
lie's always there—yes, nigh ; 
We laugh and talk and have such fun, 
How swift the moments fly ! 
But when he says, " I'd like a 
kiss," 
I 
say, " Take it, if you can ;" 
And then he smiles and says I 
am 
His Dashing little Fan. 
Dashing little Fan, &c. 
Floating with tho Tide. 
Sung by Miss BEANE with great success. 
This life is but a 
river, 
And it's hard to stern the tide, 
But while you're floating down the stream 
low merrily you glide ! 
Behind you leaving sorrow, and 
Before you life's bright side 
Is shimmering in prospective, while 
You're floating with the tide. 
CHORUS. 
Floating with the tide, boys, 
Floating \viLh the tide, 
You're leaving sorrow far behind, 
As merrily you glide ; 
Floating with the tide, boys, 
Floating with the tide, 
This life is but a 
pleasure, while 
You're floating with the tide. 
If you should meet the rapids, 
And they're growing fast and strong, 
Don't weaken ; keep a 
steady head ; 
Don't tarn that rudder wrong. 
Remember those prophetic words 
By Davy Crockett said : 
"Be sartin sure that you are right, 
And then go straight ahead." 
Floating with the tide, &c.

Sung only by Miss FANNY BEANE. 
INTRODUCTORY CHORUS.

MY DEAR LITTLE HOME, 
By Ii . rry Percy of Concross & Dixey's Minstrels, sung by Mo. 
HENRIETTA BAZZEL, of Newport, Ky. 
THERE'S a 
little white cot that is dearer than life. 
Where I 
haste when the day's toil is o'er, 
Where I 
carry no thought of the world's eager strife, 
When I 
enter its low humble door. 
! 
the smile of a 
fond loving wife there 
see, 
And I 
hear all the children's glad tone, 
This earth has no treasure more sweeter to me, 
Than the dear little home of my own. 
CHORES. 
I've a 
dear little home, yes it home of my own, 
I've a 
nice little home of my own, 
And no king is more proud as he sits on his throne; 
Than am I 
in Inv dear little home. 
! 
when ever I 
roam from this little white cot, 
10 the hurry and noise of the day, 
)1v he:irt gladly turns to that heaven- like spot, 
A 
ila I 
long to its shelters to stray. 
A 
ul I 
long for the touch of a 
hand on my brow, 
For a 
dimpled one round 1EV neck thrown, 
While the hours wanders by so wearisone now. 
Far away from my dear little home. 
I've a 
dear little home, &e. 
At the close of the day in the twilight so sweet, 
I 
wander again to the door, 
Where the loving ones over and over repeat, 
Their welcoming to me once more, 
As I 
sit by the fire with the children around, 
I 
think of the many that roam; 
No place for a 
shelter, no bed but the ground, 
No dear little home like my own. 
I've a 
dear lhtle home, vIze.

MEET ME TO NIGHT BY THE GROVES 
As sung by HARRY W ESTERN, at the Howard Athenieum, 
Boston, Mass. 
MEET me to night by the grove, 
And there I 
will breathe to thee, 
A 
story alone for thine ear. 
As dear as thou art to me: 
Meet me when stars are brightest, 
And the moon shines softly above, 
Thy voice will thrill all my spirit 
To night in the quiet grove. 
Meet me to night by the grove, 
A 
passionate tale I 
will tell, 
Come with thy magic smile near, 
Like fairies that haunt the dell. 
Will hear me breathe my worship, 
With a 
heart that never will rove, 
True to thy promise come dearest, 
With me to night by the grove. 
• 
Sung by HARRY BECKWITH. 
I 
once heard a 
proverb, worth 'graving in gold, 
'Twas spoken in years that are past, 
And he too is gone who made it his own, 
But while there's a 
world it will last. 
The saying was pithy, its meaning was this: 
Which ever way Providence leans, 
If what fortune grants won't come up to your wants, 
Von must bring down your wants to your means. 
CHORUS. 
So think of my song as you journey along, 
Thro' life and its changeable scenes, 
If your wants prove too high for your means to supply, 
Why bring down your wants to your means. 
How often we see the gay man of the world, 
With money and plenty to spare, 
Did he use it aright, but he puts it to flight, 
And appears as tho' short of his share, 
Then he pays twenty shillings to borrow a 
pound, 
Till his folly no longer he screens, 
Thus he parts with his wealth, loses station and health, 
Thro' his wants overrunning his means. 
So think cf my song, &c. 
The roughhanded ploughman, up early and late, 
Whose days with hard toil are beset, 
If he's scanty of clothes, it is nothing he owes, 
So he's richer than him who's in debt. 
For if homely his fare, he is happy withal, 
Tho' it's little from learning he gleans, 
And he never needs run from a 
bailiff or dun, 
For he measures his wants by his means. 
So think of my song, &c. 
• 
Then ye who have little, and ye who have much, 
Enjoy what you've got in content; 
Nor squander your store and your health getting more; 
Live right, and you'll never repent. 
This world is a 
garden with Fleasure well filled 
Tho' sorrow sometimes intervenes, 
But troubles will fly, as the clouds drifting by, 
if you " measure your wants by your means." 
So think of my song, &c, 
I 
really think there is no use, 
Of trying to feel gay, 
I'm getting thinner, 1 
believe, 
And fading every day; 
It's just because the girl I 
love 
Has been unkind to me, 
She's left my side away to roam, 
Far o'er the raging sea. 
Cnonts. 
My Emma Jane, my Emma Jane, 
She's gone, and I'm sure I'll ne'er see her again, 
She's gone far from me, ' way over the sea, 
Cruel and unkind Emma Jane. 
My charmer was a 
fine girl 
As you would wish to see, 
I 
loved her very fondly and 
I 
thought that she loved me; 
But it did not take me very long 
To find out my mistake, 
For she eloped with a 
dry goods clerk, 
And gave poor me the shake. 
My Emma Jane, etc. 
I 
squandered all my hard-earned cash. 
And not a 
murmur made, 
And that I 
did quite silly act, 
I 
sadly am afraid; 
But it didn't do a 
bit of good, 
With me she would not stay, 
She took all of my presents and 
With the clerk she skipped away. 
My Emma Jane, ate, •

A " swell" his lot is hard indeed, 
You little know his woes, 
The hardships of the life he leads, 
As his rounds he daily goes; 
To dress he has three times a 
day, 
And never twice the same, 
His tailor's bill's no joke to pay, 
For they charge for Bond Street fame. 
SPOKEN:—f' n

They think with such a

Their daughters might do well.

Ono:—You see in me,a swell, &c. 
After all this work he needs repose, 
The swell's work's not yet done, 
Forced to Evan's rooms he goes, 
Has " devilled kidneys" one. 
And when he's heard a glee cr song, 
He feels he's almost dead, 
So calls a 
cab to come along, 
And take him home to bed. 
SPOKEN:— For, poor fellow, he's the same routine to go thro 
day, and it's really no joke—

It's deuced hard work I

Yet has to be done by every one

STAND BY THE POOR. 
By HARRY BURNS. 
JUST listen a 
moment I'll sing you a 
song, 
And in it some truths I'll relate, 
Just to show you how easily credit reflects 
From the poor man as well as the great. 
Working day after day through the slow, weary hours, 
With hearts often troubled and sore, 
Would it not be kindness to give him a 
lift? 
'Tis noble to stand by the poor. 
Cnonus. 
Whenever you're anxious to do a 
good deed, 
And one that will always endure, 
Just help out your suffering neighbor in need, 
'Tis noble to stand by the poor. 
How often that poor man, with intellect grand, 
Must take a 
back seat every day; 
While some gawkish fellow is lord of the land— 
His cash ' tis that makes the display. 
Some world-weary wretch, out seeking for alms, 
Is drove, with a 
curse, from the door; 
I 
think this is both impolite and unkind— 
'Tis noble to stand by the poor. 
Whenever you're anxious, eta. 
How many unfortunate beings to-night 
Without food or shelter they go. 
Are living on what we may drop from our hand; 
Let's give them a 
kiss, not a 
blow. 
'Tis only otir deeds that will live when we die, 
So kindness is better, I'm sure; 
And if you believe me. between you and I. 
'Tis noble to stand by the poor. 
Whenever you're anxious, etc. 
The wealth of our nation is earned by the hand 
That is hardened by vigor and toil; 
There in the background they're forced to stand 
Who ought to be lords of the soil. 
Let them stand back to back in the contest of life, 
Till their hardships are fewer and fewer. 
Still struggling on in the midst of the strife. 
'Tis noble to stand by the poor. 
Whenever you're anxious, etc. 
Composed and written by W. H. DELEITANTT. 
Milk and honey, Oh! its funny— 
I 
cannot keep from dancing; 
For I 
love a 
girl—she's a 
pretty pearl— 
A 
lovely belle supreme— 
She's a 
lolly- pop—sweet forget-me-not— 
And her voice is so entrancing, 
She's my honeycomb, she's my sugar- plum, 
She's strawberries and cream. 
Yes, she's a 
basket full of fruit, 
She's my pretty love, she's my turtle dove. 
Iler voice is like the music of a 
flute. 
And she's just sweet sixteen. 
CHORUS. 
Milk, honey, strawberries and create (
sva.), 
Like the music of a 
happy dream (s-ym.). 
She's a 
darling! she's a 
daisy, 
She's a 
lovely plate of peaches. 
She's a 
dandy—'lasses candy— 
She's strawberries and cream. 
Repeat Chorus. 
I'm enraptured, I 
am captured, 
By a 
lovely lump of sweetness. 
She's an oyster pie, she's a 
chicken pie, 
And she haunts my every dream. 
She's a 
little maid, she's a 
lemonade, 
And the pink of perfect neatness. 
She's a 
box of dates, she's a 
bunch of grapes, 
She's strawberries and cream. 
Oh! yes, she's far too sweet to live, 
Is this lolly pop, is this candy shop, 
And her loss I 
know that I 
would grieve— 
Sweet vision of my dream.

Don't Knock Too Loud at the Door. 
Sung with immense success by the great vocal comedian, H ARRY I
\ 
f 
TA CUE. 
Although I 
am married, I 
know a 
sweet girl— 
I'm uncommonly fond of the sex— 
But this pretty girl, though she's spooney on me, 
All the time she does nothing but vex; 
She vows that she loves me, and sometimes she calls, 
Perhaps in the midst of the day ; 
She comes to my door with a 
knock, knock, knock, 
Then I 
have to go to her and say— 
CHORUS. 
Now don't knock too loud at the door, now don't; 
Now don't knock too loud at the door, now don't; 
There's somebody near, and perhaps they will hear, 
So don't knock too loud at the door, now don't. 
Now I 
made an appointment to meet this pretty dear, 
Who is really so bright and sublime, 
But oh, what a 
row—I 
remember it now, 
For I 
didn't get there just on time. 
She came hurryirg down to my residence, 
Where I 
thought to be out of the way ; 
29 
She came to the door with her loud sentiments, 
Which of coure compelled me to say— 
Now don't knock too loud, &c. 
Some time after this there came to my house 
A man that stood six foot, two ; 
He came to inform me that he was her dad, 
And to know what I 
meant to do. 
I 
informed him my wife was not far away, 
And asked him to speak with a 
thought, 
But he shouted still louder, and insisted that I 
Should appear the next morning in court. 
The next day I 
appeared at the court, and there stood 
The girl I 
loved in my heart ; 
She swore up and down I 
had promised to wed, 
And from it she wouldn't depart. 
I'd to pay fifty dollars. 
The Judge he then said 
I 
was lucky it was not any more ; 
As I 
left the court room I 
heard the crowd cry— 
" 
Now don't knock too loud at the door." 
SPOKtS---And you can bet that this put a 
stop to my flirta-
tions ; for now I 
remain at home, and my wife and I 
get 
along splendid together, and I 
never have to say any more— 
Now don't knock too loud at the door, &c.

JULIA, 
As sung by TONY PASTOR. 
Entered according to Act of Congress in the year 1875, by A. J. 
FISHER, in the office of the Librarian of Congress, at Washington. 
I'LL sing in praise of Julia, a 
proper piece of stufl; 
A 
girl who knows her way about all over, 
She's been there once before, so of course she's up to snuff, 
And I'm the chap who'd like to be her lover; 
Although she seems to favor me, somehow I 
cannot make 
An impression on her, though I 
often sound her, 
I 
really do believe, in fact a 
fever I 
will take, 
That there's not a 
living soul who can get round her. 
CHORUS. 
You might get round a 
corner, might get round a 
post, 
You might get round a 
square, and that's peculiar, 
You might get round the town, round the country, round the 
coast. 
But twill take you all your time to get round Julia. 
My Julia she is not a 
Westender, you must know, 
For Whitechapel is the place where she is housed up ; 
Although she's very plebian, in fact I 
might say low ; 
Her spirits they are high when they are roused up, 
Just touch her on her tender points, and you will quickly find 
She's not a 
girl on whom you'd ever practice, 
Although to hurt your feelings, she'd not be so' unkind; 
But she'd give you a 
straight, because the fact is— 
You might get round a 
corner, etc. 
I 
often try to court her, but find it is no go, 
Although I 
have more influence than any, 
For, when I 
try it on, she quickly lets me know 
With her hands that she for me is one too many, 
Ali, but yet I 
live in hopes that I 
shall marry her some day, 
Although the date's beyond my calculation, 
I 
now know she really loves me, but she never tells me 20, 
And so I 
tell you for your information. 
You might get round a 
Corner, etc. 
X-clamation. 
Written by NELLIE EDWARDS for CHARLES G1LDAY. 
Madame, most worthy of estimation, 
After a 
long consideration 
An much meditation 
On the great reputation 
You possess in the nation, 
I 
have a 
strong inclination, 
And to to become your relation 
To this my declaration, 
Without equivocation. 
I 
am making preparation 
By a 
speedy navigation 
To remove my habitation 
To a 
nearer situation, 
To possess my admiration 
And to pay my adoration. 
For the sake of conversation, 
And if this my declaration 
Is worthy of your observation 
And meets your approbation, 
It will impose an obligation, 
And be an aggregation 
Without dissimulation 
And beyond all calculation, 
From generation to generation, 
Of the joys of expectation 
Of yours without affectation,

The Personals, 
Written by SAUL SERTREW and sung by America's Own Vocalist, TONY 
PASTOR. 
As I 
was a 
reading the " Herald" one morning, 
The " Personal Column" I 
happened to see, 
And I 
made up a 
song while I 
was a 
reading, 
Of the things that I 
saw so funny to me. 
There were strange informations and friends an ,' 
relations, 
For each other asking, both old and the young, 
And chaps with their sweethearts appointments were maldng, 
How some of them read now I'll sing in my song. 
Oh, Baby, my darling, now meet me at " Bigots," 
And I'll buy for you, precious, a 
camel's hair shawl ; 
There's a 
love of a 
diamond that I 
have my eye on, 
And I 
also have tickets for " Lannigan's Ball." 
Oh, beautiful Georgy, oh, where art thou, darling ? 
The store I've been passing for many a 
day, 
Oh, tell me, my darling, have you been arrested, 
Or up on the Island, or gone far away ? 
Will charming young widow, so guileless and pretty, 
The night it was storming, I 
met on the train ; 
Who told her sad story on which I 
took pity, 
Please be returning my gold watch and chain. 
Oh, why don't that fellow bring back my umbrella, 
The day it was raining he borrowed from me, 
To see home a 
lady, and carried her baby, 
While his wife was a 
waiting his coming to tea.

THE PERSONALS. 
Continued. 
All is forgiven, come home to your mother, 
Your father's a 
waiting for you at the door, 
My son, don't be kicking, now take a 
good licking, 
And say you will never get drunk any more. 
Five hundred babies are wanted as midgets, 
Regardless of color, the hair, or the eyes, 
Cross-eyed or triplets, fat ones or thin ones, 
The one that cries loudest will capture the prize.

If he don't send to Smithy twenty-five dollars, 
Why, Smithy now quickly will " give him away." 
The twins that the father now left at Mrs. Grundy's, 
If they are not called for this very day, 
To the show of the babies she says she will send them, 
Then there'll be the " Dickens" and deuce now to pay. 
Meet me at Stewart's, I've ten thousand dollars, 
Whatever you wish, love I'll buy for thee ; 
The savings bank's bursted, tho' I'm not mistrusted, 
Oh, hasten, my darling, and fly now with me. 
Look out, there's detectives, and you are suspected, 
For you they are searching the city all o'er ; 
Shave off your mustache, I've got your hard cash, 
So good-bye, my Charley, you'll see me no more.

The Electric Light. 
Sung by TONY PASTOR, at his own theatre, Broadway, with great 
success. 
The time is coming when no one can tell the day from night, 
And that will be when we shall see the new electric light. 
Then gas will have to vanish, as all gassy subjects should, 
And the "Yankee Triumph" it will shine upon the bad and 
good; 
The bold policeman on his beat can never go to sleep, 
While all our ball-room beauties, who now look so race at night, 
Will not seem quite so charming by the new Electric Light. 
CHORUS. 
There's some of us will welcome, 
And some will hate the sight 
Of the latest, greatest wonder, 
That's the new Electric Light. 
The light will show our loving wives if husbands come home 
" 
straight," 
And all the " spooney " pairs at night a 
kissing at the gate! 
'Twill show the rich man just the way to help the starving 
poor, 
And the way to keep the prov. hug wolf from honest labor's 
door! 
'Twill show the road to " good old times," now pecie ; ay_ 
ment's here, 
And how long Murphy's converts will abstain from gin and 
beer! 
'Twill show us how our sweethearts keep their " curls" so 
long and bright, 
We'll see what makes their " blushes" by the new Electric 
Light. 
There's some of us, &c. 
Continued. 
This light will show us how to get the " cash " from " broken 
banks," 
And why them bold directors are allowed to play such pranks. 
'Twill show us why policemen club the helpless and the old, 
When the banks are robbed in broad daylight by burglars 
stout and bold ! 
'Twill help a 
girl to ferret out what tints her sweetheart's 
nose, 
And why her dashing neighbors wear such fine, expensive 
clothes. 
'Twiil show us if those 
right, 
We'll find our honest statesmen by the new Electric Light. 
This light will show the honest man beneath the ragged coat, 
And why our " Little Johnny" wouldn't let the people vote. 
'Twill guide the Reverand Talinage on some other vice to 
speak, 
And will show him clearly " some" are " frauds" who hear 
him twice a 
week. 
'Twill show who writes the " Personals," and what they all 
may mean, 
And why the girls with " navy busts' when dressed so stout 
are seen ?

What Talmage Did Not See. 
As sung by TONY PASTOR, with immense success. 
Air: "Castle in the Air." 
Mr. Talmage late to New York came to see each wondrous 
sight, 
To find out if the world went wrong, mid make the matter 
right; 
He visited each curious place where " Life" did find a 
home, 
In fact he had a 
midnight spree as he this town did roam; 
I 
do not wish much fault to find, of him to make complaint, 
But think at home by his fireside would have been better for 
a " Saint !" 
No doubt he saw many things of the easy kind and free, 
But some misery he could help to cure, he had not eyes to see. 
He did not see our working girls as the snow was falling fast, 
Creep home to attic, cramped and small, thro' the chilly 
wintry blast ; 
Her wretched home of poverty is roofless o'er her head, 
Her heart is bleak and cold and sad ! her meal a 
crust of 
bread. 
He did not see the twinkling stars shine down from the blue 
sky, 
Upon her upturned face of woe as she lay there to die; 
Heard not her suffering cry " 
help !" as her soul from 
bondage free; 
Sped swiftly to the unknown shore! THAT Talmage did not 
see. 
40 
WHAT TALMAGE DID NOT SEE. 
Contintied. 
He did not see our laboring men in life's sad battle beat, 
Working from daylight until dark that food their wives might 
eat ; 
He did not see dark hunger's cloud grow denser every day, 
Nor capital, with iron hand, drag down each workman's 
pay; 
He did not see each savings bank our poor, hard earnings 
He went where luxury abounds in the halls of gilded sin; 
The outcasts of the gutter, he in scorn did let them be, 
No hand he them reached out to save, such sights he did not 
see. 
I 
have often pondered in my mind, he had better go to 
work, 
And purify his own good town before he tries New York; 
I 
never thought that Brooklyn was the long sought " promised 
land," 
Or even that its parsons were the famous Gideon's band. 
I 
hope before he next starts out in search of sin to roam, 
He'll use his purifying broom, and sweep much nearer 
home; 
Or if he must keep on his course and will not let us be, 
He'll give a 
dime and not a 
tract when mkery he does see.

Song of All Songs. 
As sung by America's Own Vocalist, TONY PASTOR. 
Air ..---The Captain With His Whiskers. 
I 
will sing you a 
song of the songs so gay, 
That I 
saw in a 
window as I 
passed one day ; 
There was the " Marsellaise" and the " Goot Old Fatherland, 
And the jolly songs of England and every other land. 
As I 
read them along, oh, my heart filled with joy, 
For I 
saw the old songs that I 
sung when a 
boy; 
'Twas our Home, Sweet Home, and the Old Arm Chair, 
And the Star Spangled Banner and Erin Go 13ragh! 
SPOKEN.—Yes, these were the good old songs that our fath-
ers and our mothers, and everybody sung. 
Now its Pull Down the Blind, Come in and Shut the Door,

Since Terry Joined the Gang, I'm Not Myself At All, 
There's Bound to be a 
Row, On the Raging Canawl ! 
With the Finest Police, Ten Thousand Miles Away, 
Rolling Home in the Morning, When the Band Begins to Play. 
There's Eileen Alanna, On a 
Flying Trapeze, 
And Hilderbrand Montrose, A 
Shelling Green Peas ; 
Up in a 
Balloon, playing Billiards and Pool, 
All on a 
Sunday Night When the Parlor it is Full. 
That's the way the Story Goes, I'm Waiting, Love For Thee, 
I 
Hear an Angel Sing, and Shoo Fly, Don't Bodder Me; 
Hold the Fort, Oh, Emma, My Dream of Love is O'er, 
Let Me Like a 
Soldier Fall, on Grimes' Cellar Door. 
A Hundred Years Ago, Strolling Up in Central Park, 
Oh, What Lots of Fun, Going Out Upon a 
Lark; 
A Courting in the Rain, When the Moon is Shining Bright, 
And Skating on the Ice, All on a Summer Night. 
Muldoon the Solid Man, He Played Upon the Drum, 
Hurrah ! for Old Ireland, Happy Days Will Come; 
Don't Get Weary, Children, Oh, Never Say Die,

When ,They're Making Me a 
King. 
As sung by America's Own Vocalist, TONY PASTOR, at his own theatre, 
Broadway. 
I 
had a 
dream the other night, I 
dreamt I 
was a 
king, 
And fifty million subjects to my honor they did sing; 
When I 
awoke, I 
soon found out the dream it wasn't true; 
I 
don't think I 
shall be a 
king, I 
really don't ; do you? 
CHORUS. 
When the moon is made of green cheese, when pigs begin to 
fly, 
When four-and- twenty blackbirds are all baked in a 
pie; 
\\Then the pie is opened, if the birds begin to sing, 
That will be about the time they're making me a 
king. 
Were I 
a 
king, the workingman should have his " old time" 
pay, 
And sewing girls should never toil for thirty cents a 
day, 
I'd take a 
trip to Canada, where leIie 
c 
Las gone, 
And make the people happy the. e, ,: ley are all for-
Lorne. 
When the moon, &c. 
Were I 
a 
king, I'd give each girt a 
rich and wealthy beau, 
On every blooming widow I 
a 
husband would bestow ; 
I'd give a 
candy store apiece to little girl.; and boys, 
And from the Elevated Road, I'd soon extract the noise. 
When the moon, &c.

WHEN THEY 'RE MAKING ME A KING. 
Continued. 
Were I 
a 
king I'd go around with Talmage every night, 
I'd take a 
peep in every then to see them drink and fight •, 
But when I 
feel inclined to go and see the haunts of sin, 
I 
think that Brooklyn would be found a 
good place to begin. 
When the moon, &c. 
Were I a 
king, I'd make the parsons practice what they 
preach, 
I'd take away policemen's clubs that have too long a 
reach; 
The beggars ard the man of wealth 
I'd 
give an 
equal 
chance, 
And find out how much Murphy gets for preaching temper-
ance. 
When the moon, Sze. 
Were I 
a 
king, I'd make the land with milk and noney fl ow , 
Who was it robbed a 
certain grave? I 
very soon should 
know •, 
On every grand piano leg, I'd draw a 
stocking fair, 
Lest Comstock should pop inland find some misdemeanor 
there.

COR.—I'm glad you're out, but I've been arrested myself, 
for mayhem. 
DAN.—That was a 
tough charge. 
How was it ? 
CoR.---I was arrested for biting my nails. 
DAN.—How did you get out of it ? 
Cwt.—The judge told me that unless I 
got some minister 
or preacher who knew me to vouch for my character, he'd 
send me up to give sparring exhibitions with Joe Coburn ; so 
I 
sent for Senator Bob Hart, and he got me out right away. 
By the way, where have you been ?

DAN.—Shure, man (Sherman), I've been to Washington to 
see the President. 
He's (Haye) a

Ha, ha, ha!

DAN.—I 
am laughing at nothing. 
COR.—Well, if you look in the glass you will see a 
great 
deal less. 
Let us sing a 
song. 
FOREMEN ON THE ELEVATED ROAD. 
Here we are, two light-hearted Irishmen, 
We hold our heads as high as any in the land, 
We shun all Irish like Pat Rooney ; we want you to un-
dersta»d 
We're foremen on the Elevated Road. 
Two dollars a 
day is all the pay we get, 
In our gang is Mike the Bite, alias the Weehawken Pet. 
We keep our men to work, and never let them set 
Like the foremen on the Elevated Road. 
CHORUS. 
Then give three hearty cheers for Cornalius and Dan, 
Who can warble a " Come all ye" like true-born Irishmen ; 
We like no interference when in charge of our gang, 
Do the foremen on the Elevated Road. 
Every morn at eight o'clock we get them all together, 
'Tis then we call the roll, in wet or shiny weather ; 
It makes but little difference—they're all as tough as 
leather, 
Are the laborers on the Elevated Road. 
At half-past five at night, ' tis then that we get done, 
To our wives and children home we very quickly run ; 
They say my boy is like his father— the little son of a 
gun, 
Oh, oh. we're proud foremen on the Elevated 
oad. 
If I 
was an Alderman. 
Composed and sung with great success by BEN H . 
BENTON. 
If I 
was an Alderman in this great and glorious land, 
To help the workingman I'd make people understand 
I'd be the first to hallo about the new silver dollar, 
And all who kicked should get the collar, if I 
was an Alderman. 
The East River Bridge should be done and elevated roads be 
run 
For five cent fares, to help the workingman ; 
Then I'd have a 
deal to say about all sinecurists' pay, 
Those who work fe ,
.v hours a 
day, if I 
was an Alderman. 
I 
would look for all the poor, who are starving by the score, 
They should never work no more, I 
would have an open door; 
'Iwo good gold dollars a 
day should be the laborers' pay, 
That is what I'd surely say, if I 
was an Alderman. 
I 
would pass a 
liquor law that would never be a 
bore, 
And not favor one particular clique or clan, 
Put insurance thieves in jail, and have no one go their bail, 
Up the river they should sail, if I 
was an Alderman. 
Next I'd look for all the cranks who bust our savings banks, 
I 
would drown them all in tanks, and thus gain the people's 
thanks; 
I'd 
hang Henry Ward Beecher, the 
notorious 
Brooklyn 
screecher, 
And famous free-love teacher, if I 
was an Alderman. 
I'd bring ould Ireland here, who is to my heart so dear, 
And not let England make slaves of the Irishmen ; 
The red, white and blue and green together should be seen, 
And no one should go between, if I 
was an Alderman. 
Then I'd make the people stare, by proclaiming myself Mayor, 
All the Vanderbilts should share their father's money fair; 
I 
would hire Tammany Hall, have George Francis Train to 
bawl, 
Call him President for a 
stall, if I 
was an Alderman. 
I 
would take all our newsboys, and fill their hearts with joy, 
.knd in a 
large school make each one a 
man ; 
With the money of William Astor I'd hire Tony Pas'Ar 
To be their schoolmaster, if I 
was an Alderman.

The Baby that Makes Everybody Stare 
Composed and sung with immense success by BEN H . 
BENTON 
I ai- -
_.: ichael McGowan, well-known in this great land, 
Celebrated for the many things I've done; 
I'm proud of all my family, you've heard me sing of Mary , 
So I'll try to do as well now wid my son. 
At all the big bug dances he's there early and bright— 
His society is courted everywhere. 
So popular wid the girls is he, he's a 
new ma.F;'1 every night, 
He's the baby that makes everybody stare. 
CHORUS. 
He could charm you, ' twould alarm you, 
He's so purty and so fair ; 
Any turtle-dove would fall in love 
With the baby that makes everybody stare. 
Like  
his sister he's a 
dancer, he'd paralyze a 
blind man's sight, 
1,7sith his society dancing no one can compare. 
At the Buckingham he leads the ball on every gala night, 
He's the baby that makes everybody stare. 
Ball orders by the dozen he has pasted on our wall, 
Along wid invites to receptions everywhere ; 
All clubs are highly honored to have him at their ball— 
He's the baby that makes everybody stare. 
He could charm you, 8.:c. 
His manners are so docile ' twould chill you to the marrow, 
When you'd see him take a 
lady by the hand. 
He is so gentle with it, he's as frisky as a 
sparrow 
When he waltzes to the music of the band. 
As a 
gambler he is perfect ; if he gives it to you straight, 
With his tip you could beat faro bank anywhere; 
As a 
tout with the race-horses you bet he can't be beat— 
He's the baby that makes everybody stare. 
He could charm you, & c.

As sung with immense success by BEN H . 
BENTON. 
/ 
need no introduction, so well known am I, 
For my honesty in this city I've gained fame ; 
I'm called by some Boss O'Kelly, I 
run the Tammany Hall, 
Mini politicians tremble at the mention of my name. 
I 
have but to spake the word, and you'd perish from my sight, 
There's very few can beat me turning a 
trick ; 
I 
could make you President, or to Washington have you sent, 
What a 
King I'd make, oh, oh, I'm solid as a 
brick. 
CHORUS. 
I 
am so consequential, and so influential, 
When once I 
make a 
move, ' tis useless' to kick ; 
Noted In:- 
rventility, I'm a 
man of great ability, 
I'm John O'Kelly, the Great, I'm solid as a 
brick. 
When Congress it does meet, before they pass a 
law 
All our statesmen can be seen consulting me ; 
'Ti s then I 
snake my mind, like the honest man I am, 
But of course I 
don't forget ould Tammany. 
There are some renegades—there's black sheep in every flock, 
But with our next move we'll make them sick ; 
When once more we have—on next election day— 
'Tis then they'll see I'm solid as a 
brick. 
I'm so consequential, &el)

My Darling Son, 
Composed and sung by BEN H . 
BENTON. 
I'll sing to you of my darling son, 
He's nicknamed gallous Billy, 
He wears a 
great big stand-up collar 
That he calls a 
picadilly. 
He travels all the avenues 
In a 
style you would call grand; 
He teaches the girls to pivot on a 
5-cent copper rivet, 
In a 
way you couldn't understand. 
When he comes home from work at night 
He goes down to Harry Hill's; 
And whin there's to be an exhibition there 
His name is in big letters on the bills. 
He ginerally set-to's with the Mouse, 
And says he makes a 
rattler v 
id young Kelly, 
But whin I 
put the mits on with him at night, 
He hits me a 
whack in the belly. 
He took his sister's best underclothes 
To give to an Irish fairy, 
And buried some jewelry in the hock 
That belonged to his cousin Mary; 
He takes in all the theatres, 
And says he'll be an actor yet, 
And 'nave his picture in the windows along with 
Clara Morris, 
When he doubles with the Hoboken Pet. 
When I 
try .0 
give him good advice, 
And ask him to be a 
good boy. 
He tells me to go and chew bean soup, 
That I 
mustn't take him for a 
toy. 
I 
surely think he'll do time yet 
If he don't mend his way, 
And quit his racket of swiping wipes 
That he sells to them sheenys in the bay. 
Written expressly for SHEEHAN and JoNas by BEN H . 
BENTON. 
You may talk about your grand parades or anything so gay, 
Rut we're raising a 
company for next St. Patrick's Day. 
With the colors of old Ireland we'll make the people .glad, 
'Twill be the finest show, my boy, that New York ever had. 
CHORUS. 
With regalias looking bright and umbrellas in hand, 
We'll march down to Hibernia Hall, and there we'll make a 
stand; 
With the shamrock in our hats, and biled shirts looking fine, 
With an Irish band in front of us, we then will fall in line. 
We do honor to St. Patrick, ould Ireland's greatest saint, 
Be gob, whin we turn out, me boys, we make the ladies faint. 
With all the Father Matthew clubs to fall with us in line, 
And noble band of Hibernians, I 
tell you 'twill be fine. 
With regalias looking bright, &c. 
We'll have the 69th with us,whose show would break your heart, 
We'll march the city through and through when once we make 
a 
start. 
And arm in arm together the best of friends we'll be, 
From the laborers on ti:e pipes above to the mayor of our city. 
With regalias looking bright, & c. 
So now, brave boys, we must be off, we can no longer stay, 
1.nd if we. 
think we've pleased you we'll call another day. 
Your kind applause we hope you'll grant, to do our best 
we've tried, 
So don't forget us Irish boys that stand here side by side. 
With regalias looking bright, &c. 
Written originally by W ASH. FAVOR, and sung with great success by 
CHAS. GILDAY. 
I 
am a 
dashing fellow 
That you very seldom meet, 
And for dancing and singing 
I 
know I 
can't be beat. 
For my style is so peculiar, 
And very different from the rest, 
So to please you this evening 
I'll try and do my best, 
C 
HORUS. 
I'm as happy as can be, 
In summer time, while the moon doth shine 
And I'll sing and dance for thee, 
To please you all I'll try. 
For I 
am a 
dashing fellow 
That you very seldom meet, 
And for dancing and singing 
I 
know I 
can't be beat. 
Oh, now I 
must go and leave you, 
And I'll bid you all farewell ; 
For I 
love a 
girl, a 
pretty pearl, 
Who lives down in a 
dell. 
I 
promised to meet her this evening, 
Down by a 
running stream ; 
In a 
shady grove I 
will meet my love, 
And of happiness I 
will dream. 
I'm as happy, &c. 
60 
My Gal She is a 
Lusher, 
Written by W ASH. FAVOR for CHARLES GILDAy. 
My gal she is a 
lusher, 
She's always on the booze, 
And to see her drink cheap gin would make you sick. 
Her nose is always blooming, 
It's as red as any rose, 
And her hair it is the color of a 
brick. 
But still she is a 
masher, 
And on her you bet I'm stuck, 
And I'd spend a 
quarter on her any day. 
For she'd straighten out my whiskers, 
And say I 
was a 
duck, 
And my darling then it's this to me she'd say. 
CHORUS. 
I'm a 
dandy, I'm a 
loly pop, 
You can bet your life that I'm a 
swell ; 
With my nobby walk, I'm no dizzy gawk, 
For I 
captivate the pretty Broadway belle. 
My daisy is a 
walker, 
On the track she is the boss, 
She could beat O'Leary any day. 
She can wrestle like a 
major, 
And never get a 
toss, 
For she's just as limber as a 
bale of hay. 
She can also walk the tight- rope, 
And balance on her ear, 
Or do a 
juggling act with any clown. 
She can throw a 
double flip flop, 
Or break neck song and dance 
As good as any ham fat in this town. 
I'm a 
dandy, &c.

Courting Cards.—This Series of Cards has been arranged 
to meet a 
want fiequently felt by young people—a 
want of means of 
expressing one's sentiments in such a way as to be non-committal. 
Many young ladies are visited by gentlemen who are either too dia. 
dent or too fearful of a 
repulse, to venture upon asking the momentous 
question. The lady is restrained, by custom and a 
sense of propriety, 
from doing anything that would seem to be an unlady-like encourage-
nient. 
As a 
result of this dilemma, many lives are spent as an unloved 
tedious existence, which might have been prolonged and enjoyed in the 
happiness of matrimony. This pack of Cards will overcome the diffi-
culty, and being in the shape of quastions and answers, will cover every 
phase of courtship. 
The sentiments conveyed therein need not be 
adopted by the parties to the game as their own, unless it accords with 
the state of their affection, which fact makes further explanation un-
necessary. The playing of these Cards is not restricted to two Vayers, 
but may be enjoyed by evening parties
