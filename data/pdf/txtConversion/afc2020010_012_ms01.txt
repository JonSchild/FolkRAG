Transcript of Interview with Bobby Acker, July 16, 2020 
By Ethan Sharp 
Ethan (00:00:01): 
All right. Okay. Yeah, it hears me over here. All right. So, this is Ethan Sharp. I'm here today with Robert 
Acker. He goes by Bobby, and this is July 16th, 2020. We're here at New Vista. So, Bobby, to get us started, 
you said you could share your story, start with talking about where you were born, where you grew up 
and maybe where you went to high school and then your personal story of recovery. 
Bobby (00:00:39): 
Absolutely. Kind of in a nutshell, early life, I was born in Alabama. I moved then to Georgia and then moved 
to Kentucky. I think I moved to Kentucky when I was like six or seven, so I don't have a lot of memories 
from the other places that I lived at. But I was, I was raised by my mom and dad. I had an older sister. My 
father and my mother actually went through a separation phase when I turned about eight. And then 
during that separation phase, I was kind of bouncing back and forth a little bit. My father actually passed 
away when I was nine. He had some complications to his gallbladder, went to the hospital. The hospital 
misdiagnosed him and sent him back home. And later on that night, he passed away. So dealing with that 
was probably one of the first like big traumatic things in my life. I remember actually seeing him after he 
passed away in the hospital, you know, white, pale. And it's funny because I don't remember a ton of stuff, 
like from early on. Like some people remember things from 34 years ago. That was one of the big, like first 
things that I remember. 
Ethan (00:02:03): 
So, you we're in Kentucky. 
Bobby (00:02:05): 
Yeah, we were in Kentucky. He was living in Cynthiana. My mom was living in Versailles. So we, you know, 
we drove there, and my mom thought it was important for me to see him after he passed away. So, I went 
in there and very traumatic. So then that started off, you know, being raised by a single mother. She did 
the best that she could, you know, doing both, both roles. 
Bobby (00:02:33): 
She worked a ton, so it kind of caused some issues with me, you know, feeling like I didn't have a parent 
sometimes. She was a great, great mom, great mom in all aspects, really. Like I said, did the best that she 
could with what she had. Let's see. I was diagnosed with ADHD at some point there. I got put on Ritalin. 
Looking back now, I want to say that I was overmedicated. I remember going through fifth, sixth grade, 
middle school, just kind of like a walking zombie, if that makes sense. Very, just blah. And then I think 
eighth grade, middle school, I kind of found a niche in sports, and I got really involved in sports. I quit 
taking ADHD medicine cause I had kind of an outlet to get rid of all that energy and the focus. 
Bobby (00:03:41): 
So, I got really involved in wrestling and football and track. I did sports all year round. I went to high school, 
same thing. It was all about the sports, right? I actually wrestled for Woodford County, which was a really 
well known wrestling school. And, you know, went to state our team, won state in wrestling. I played 
football. And then kinda what happened was I graduated. And then like the main thing that was kind of 
2 
 
keeping me on track was over, you know. Like I didn't have anything to focus on. I didn't have anything. I 
had to get good grades because I wanted to play sports. And then, and now they're over. I don't have 
anything to look forward to. I ended up going to a community college for, I think, three semesters. 
Bobby (00:04:36): 
The first semester I started going to a lot of parties. I started drinking a lot. My first semester, I think I had 
like three A's and a B, and by that third semester, I just quit going to class. Cause I was staying out all night 
drinking. I started dabbling in drugs, smoking marijuana things like that. So I get kicked out of school. You 
know, my mom, I'm commuting from home. My mom doesn't know what to do with me at that point. So 
she sends me a little with my uncle for a little while. He's in the military. He's very structured. She thought 
that that would help. It didn't, it actually made me more resentful with everybody around me. And I just 
continued down that path of working for the weekends so that I could party. Slowly it progressed to where 
I'm smoking weed or drinking during the week. 
Bobby (00:05:40): 
I ended up leaving his house and going back to my mom's house, and I get another job. And the next, I 
don't know, two years, it's just partying as much as I can, you know, living life up. I saw where like kind of 
my life was going and, I had some moments of clarity where like I don't want to be like this. Like I see all 
my friends, they're starting to graduate from college and getting their houses and getting their careers. 
And I was like, I want that. So, I start trying to position myself to start working that way. I, I took a job at 
a jail as a, as a deputy jailer, thinking that would kind of fix some of the problems that I had. And it did for 
about six months, you know. I got there. I was back on track. 
Bobby (00:06:30): 
I wasn't doing any drugs. I was still drinking here and there. After about six months, I started doing drugs 
again. This time, you know, a lot more pain pills. I got, I got really hooked on Percocet thirties, which were 
really popular at that time. And over that next two years that I worked there, I was doing a lot of shady 
things while I wasn't at work. And then I was coming to work as a sworn peace officer. I was kind of living 
this double life. I was blowing through all the money I was making. I had to move back in with my mom at 
one point. And then, let's see, this is kind of the pivotal moment that, that really like legally changed, 
changed me going down that path is, I blew through my entire paycheck in like two days, and I was still 
wanting more drugs. And one of the guys that I was buying drugs off off the streets ended up in the same 
jail that I was working at. So I ended up, I ended up bringing some drugs into the jail, and he was giving 
me some free ones on the outside. They call that promoting contraband, and it's a felony, and I got caught 
doing it. So that was my first, my first encounter with the law. I got two felonies, you know, and the judge 
was pretty lenient overall. He gave me 10 years on the shelf that I didn't have to go to jail or do anything. 
I just had to go on probation. So I signed for the first deal I got. And I was like, well, that sounds easy. You 
know, I, I just have to quit doing drugs. 
Bobby (00:08:21): 
I didn't understand how, how much that this disease had a grip on me at that point. I was still very 
delusional. So I was like, yeah, let's try that out. You know, I'll just, you know, be good for a few years. I'll 
be off paper. I won't have to go to jail. So that is when a lot of my issues started because I wasn't able to 
get off drugs. I wasn't able to stay off drugs. So I was going in and I was, I was drug testing, and it was 
positive. And then so that's when I started getting sent to rehabs. I went to Morehead Inspiration Center, 
3 
 
which is a 6 to 18 month program. It's a lot like the Hope Center here in Lexington. And I went through 
that whole program. I didn't really take it very serious. I was really just trying to stay out of jail, honestly. 
Ethan (00:09:12): 
You did the six months there? 
Bobby (00:09:12): 
I think I did 10 or 11 months there. Towards the end of the program, I started drinking while I was in the 
program. As soon as I left there, the problem that I saw looking back now was like, I completed it. And it 
was kind of like when I graduated high school, I'm done, I'm moving back to my mom's house, but what 
do I do now? I'm just kind of lost. So, I ended up at that point getting-- 
Ethan (00:09:41): 
Was that a 12 step program? 
Bobby (00:09:43): 
12 step based. Yeah. So, and what I did was I got a sponsor that would just sign my paper, and I wasn't 
really doing any work on myself. I was just kind of floating, you know. So what happened is, I come back 
home to my mom's house, and within like a week or two, I got introduced to heroin, and I got introduced 
to, to IV drug use. 
Bobby (00:10:06): 
And within, I think within two months, my life was, I hadn't gotten locked up or arrested yet, but I was 
completely miserable. And I actually checked myself back into that same, same Morehead Inspiration 
Center. I went through there again, this time for a little over a year. And towards the end of the program, 
again, I became the peer mentor supervisor. And I had quit. I had scratched the surface with the AA 
program. Like I'd gotten a sponsor. He took me through the first six steps. I really dedicated myself to 
working on myself, and I, I gained a lot from it. I gained serenity. I gained peace. I was, I was dealing with 
a lot of the underlying issues to the drug addiction. And then towards the end of the program-- 
Ethan (00:10:55): 
That was the second time? 
Bobby (00:10:57): 
The second time. Yeah. And then towards the end of the program, something happened, and I just lost 
interest. Like I was feeling better, things were going better. And I was like, I don't need this. I don't need 
this support, you know. I think I got this thing on my own. And over the course of that last three months, 
I started using again. I was around the wrong people at the wrong time. You know, I had drifted from any 
type of recovery program, and it was right in front of me. And I, and you know, it started off with a couple 
of pain pills, and next thing I know, I'm using heroin, IV heroin, you know, injecting heroin in me again. 
This time, I got caught while I was still there. 
Bobby (00:11:44): 
And I went back to jail for a little while. I got in front of the judge, and did my whole, you know, I'm so 
sorry. I've learned from it. Will you please let me out of jail? He, he let me out of jail again. This time I was 
4 
 
just staying at my mom's house, and I was still using. And I went through that cycle again for another few 
months. And finally, I went in to, to drug test for the PO, and I was dirty again. I get, I got arrested again, 
went back to jail for three or four months. I think this is kind of the turning point. So this is the last time 
that I got sober. I was in there, and the judge said, the first time I went in front of the judge, he said, I 
think we're going to send you to prison is basically what he said. 
Bobby (00:12:33): 
So he was like, come back in a month, and we'll talk about it. So then I'm sitting in a jail cell just thinking 
about, man, I'm going to prison for 10 years. I mean, that's, that's kind of an eye opener a little bit. Then 
he comes back a month later. He says, we're going to let you out in drug court. All you need is home 
placement. We're going to give you one last chance. I remember calling my mom at that point to see if I 
could come back to her house. And she told me no, and that was another eye opener for me. Like, I've, 
I've pushed everybody away from me. I've stolen from her throughout this whole time and done, pawned 
her pressure washer, just a lot of stuff that goes along with it. So I ended up calling around, and I found 
this place called the Shepherd's House in Lexington. 
Bobby (00:13:18): 
And it's a yearlong program. And so that's what I did. I called they had a three month waiting list on it. So 
I had to wait. I think I only waited about two months, and they finally said, come on, we got a bed for you. 
So I went to the Shepherd's House. I checked in. I was in drug court. I was at the Shepherd's house. I had 
to get a job. First job I'd had in three or four years. While I was in the program. You have to get it within a 
week. And then I had to get a sponsor. I had to, it was just so overwhelming. It was a lot of stuff for 
someone who had just come out of jail, who'd been in there for four months. And like when you're in jail, 
and in jail, you kind of, you kind of slow down if that makes sense, cause you're not in a hurry to do 
anything. So all of a sudden you just throw me into this place where I have to get a job. I have to work 
steps. I have to attend all these drug court meetings and court and go to therapy and all this stuff that 
goes with the Shepherd's House. And it was, it was hard. This is just my personal story, and I've heard 
other people go different routes, but they tried really hard to get me on some anxiety medicine, some 
depression medicine. For some reason, I decided not to do it because for me, I think this is a very 
important part of it, is that like it's person to person. I know a lot of friends who take anxiety medicine at 
the beginning, and it helped them. 
Bobby (00:14:51): 
But for me, I wanted to learn how to cope with all this anxiety that I had and learn how to deal with it. 
And I thought that the anxiety medicine would be too much of a crutch for me. And I know myself, and it 
might lead me down to other stuff. So that's what I did. And the first three to four months really, really 
sucked. I was, I was just barely hanging on. But I was pretty serious about it because that four months that 
I was in jail right before that, it was like, all, all I was doing was laying in my little cell thinking about how 
messy my life was and like willing to do anything to, to not feel the way I'm feeling right now. So that 
momentum, that, that willingness is kind of what pushed me through and got me through those rough, 
really the rough six months at the beginning. So yeah, I got a sponsor. I started working some steps. I had 
a conversation with him at the beginning that like, Hey, I scratched the surface of this AA thing. I want to 
go all the way through. I seem to have fizzled out last time. And I need someone to push me through them, 
and he was awesome. He did exactly what I asked him to do. Sometimes I didn't like it, but he did. I 
completed drug court. I started working at a place called Five Guys, the burger place. I'm making like 7.25 
an hour. The, the guy, the owner of the Five Guys is also in recovery, and he hired me. And it's funny 
because we're actually friends today, and he'll tell me like, you know, the first month or two, you worked 
5 
 
there, I almost fired you. Like three or four times. Cause you were so slow and like just, you know, had 
trouble putting thoughts together. 
Bobby (00:16:36): 
But yeah, he gave me chances. I ended up working my way up in that company to the assistant general 
manager, which was awesome to see that. Completed drug court. I completed the Shepherd's House. I 
actually ended up working at the Shepherd's House for about three years. Yeah. I turned around, I became 
house manager. So I lived, I lived with the guys, enforced rules. I helped them. I continued to work at Five 
Guys and then somebody came to me and was telling me about peer support work. And, and I thought 
that maybe I might be interested in that. So, I looked more into it. You know, I don't have a college 
education because of the story I just told you. So, I thought it might be a good option for me. I looked 
more into it. I saw that they were having a training, actually here, in a couple of months. So I saved up 
some money. I paid for it. I went to the training. And then I started applying for other jobs. It was, it was 
really scary for me because I had started making pretty good money at this restaurant. 
Ethan (00:17:58): 
So you were doing the restaurant and the house manager at the same time? 
Bobby (00:18:01): 
Yeah, yeah. I was taking about a half pay cut to initially get into peer support work. So that was scary. But 
I thought that that was kind of my calling. I felt it, you know, like I don't want to flip burgers. I want to use 
all these trials and tribulations, these struggles that I've had in my life. I want to use them for something 
positive. And then I talked to some, some, a mentor of mine who had, who had gotten into this field, this 
line of work. And I asked his opinion on it. I was like, here's my, here's my dilemma. You know, I'm going 
to be financially insecure, cause I'm going to be having less money. But I think that I want to do it. I know 
you made that transition recently. Like what do you think? And he was like, I'll never forget. He said, I've 
been doing this for about a year. And it was the best decision I've ever made. He said, I feel like over the 
last year, I have not worked a single day over the last year, and I've gotten paid for it. And I was like, I like 
that. I like that concept. So I, I went ahead and made the transition. I actually started working at Recovery 
Works in Georgetown for, I worked there, I applied for there, and I also applied for New Vista at the same 
time. Recovery Works called first. So I started working there. New Vista called me about a month or two 
later. So I ended up leaving Recovery Works pretty quick, and, and coming here. 
Ethan (00:19:34): 
What year was that you did the training? 
Bobby (00:19:41): 
I did the training, it's not up there. I did the training 2017, I think. End of 2017. And I was working here I 
think July or August of 2018. So I've been here about two years now, so. And those are my completions 
[on the wall]. 
Ethan (00:20:14): 
Shortly after you did the training? 
Bobby (00:20:15): 
6 
 
Yeah. Yeah. I did the, I did the training and then pretty quick after that I became a peer support, like 
working in this field. I went to, let's see. 
Ethan (00:20:27): 
Your registration and then you register with the state. Is that what, do you automatically get that after 
the training? 
Bobby (00:20:35): 
No. So that one is actually different than what they do here. So, there's different, there's different types 
of peer certifications. The one that they do here is an adult peer support certificate. That, that one is 
actually registered through the state. And it's, it's specified for drug and alcohol. I'm also youth certified, 
so I can work with children. And they also have mental health specific. So there's a lot of different ones 
out there. 
Ethan (00:21:09): 
I just hadn't seen that before. 
Bobby (00:21:10): 
Yeah, that one's actually, I think, expired. 
Ethan (00:21:15): 
Yeah, yeah, it is. 
Bobby (00:21:19): 
But it's cool. I really, I really enjoy putting those up there, especially when I'm working with people. Cause 
like therapists have their diplomas and stuff, and it's like, these are my accomplishments. Like I, I 
completed drug court, which is not an easy task, you know. And so yeah, I started working here. I loved it 
right out of the gate. Some issues that I had when I first started working here was the people that worked 
here were not a hundred percent sure how to utilize a peer support because it is a newer role. And so my 
first four months here, they gave me an office, and they said, just help out with intakes. So that was kinda 
my first four months here. 
Ethan (00:22:05): 
Were you the first one, or were there others here? 
Bobby (00:22:10): 
I was the first one here. There was, there was one that was upstairs in the youth department. And he 
worked here for about six months, like two years before I got here. But other than that, other than that, I 
was the first one. So, and it was, it was a lot of new staff higher up here, so they weren't sure how to 
utilize me effectively. So it was, it was scary at first, but then ultimately it was kind of cool cause I got to 
basically make my own position, which was pretty awesome when you think about it. So the first like 
three, four months, I'm just helping out with intakes. I'm learning terminology. I'm learning the lingo. I'm 
meeting with every single client that comes in for services during the intake process. I'm telling them kind 
of the gist of my story. I'm making them feel welcome, like, Hey, this is a good place. I'll walk them around 
and show them where the bathrooms are. And what was cool was like-- 
7 
 
Ethan (00:23:06): 
And this is all outpatient? 
Bobby (00:23:06): 
Yeah. This is all outpatient here. And there's different types of peers too. You have outpatient peer, 
inpatient peer, mental health, substance abuse. But this is outpatient adult. 
Ethan (00:23:21): 
I was just wondering. You do have an inpatient facility? 
Bobby (00:23:23): 
We do. It's the Schwartz Center. Yeah. It's over on Buckhorn, off Alumni. So what was really cool about 
the intake process. That little gap where I was just doing those is that the numbers came out like about 
four months after I worked here. And the keep rate when I first started working, it was about 50%. And 
over a four month period, the graph, they have a graph that ties it together and everything, but it steadily 
went up to where the keep rate was 80% like the fourth month I worked here. So it was kind of cool to be 
able to see that data show that, hey, a peer can be beneficial, even in the smallest capacity, you know, 
just doing little intakes and making people feel welcome. The company's making more money. The clients 
are coming back and getting the help they need. 
Bobby (00:24:18): 
So that was kind of my first, I guess, accomplishment. And I had it, I had the picture saved and everything. 
So from there, you know, we started doing more like one-on-one sessions. I started talking with different 
people in the organization, getting forms that I needed, consent forms, all this stuff. I started meeting 
with people, kind of like therapists do, one-on-one for an hour. We started up a referral process. So the 
therapist will refer someone to me who they think needs peer support services, some extra support in 
their life. Then I'll put them on my caseload. It's really cool because if you go through the Medicaid regs, 
I'm very flexible as far as like, I can meet people out in the community. So it was just kind of this whole 
journey of like exploring and figuring it out as I go, which I really loved, because it gave me all that 
experience versus just coming in here and being like, here's what you do. And, and I learn better when I 
have a say in kind of forming things together. 
Ethan (00:25:25): 
So the therapist kind of decides the plan of care and then they might meet with you once a week, or how 
does that work? 
Bobby (00:25:35): 
It just depends on where they're at. Some people I meet with once a week, there's a couple that I've met 
with before, like multiple times a week. And then there's some people I meet with once a month. So it 
just depends on kind of where they're at, what they feel comfortable with. And yeah, I'd say one of the 
big things too, is like, I have to advocate for my services to the therapist. So, that was kind of a tricky thing 
at first, because just like the higher ups here didn't really understand, and therapists didn't really 
understand at all, all the way. Some of them did, had a good idea. So, like I said, those first three months 
that I was doing intakes, I was also trying to sell peer support services through the therapist, advocating 
for them. "Hey, here's what I do. Here's the benefit of it. I'm a nice guy." Like give me some referrals 
8 
 
Ethan (00:26:30): 
So how was that? 
Bobby (00:26:36): 
It took some time. Finding, finding a timeframe where they're, they're not busy. 
Ethan (00:26:42): 
Were there questions that they asked you? 
Bobby (00:26:45): 
Some of them have asked me like very broad questions, like, so what exactly do you do? And then all the 
way to specific questions like, can you, can you meet with someone in the community? What do you do 
if a client is struggling in this aspect? You know. 
Ethan (00:27:01): 
So just exchanging information? 
Bobby (00:27:01): 
Yeah, just, yeah, trying to bring the knowledge and the awareness of peer support to all the coworkers 
here. And like I said, it's a slow process, but after, I don't know, six months of working here, I had really 
good rapport built up with all the staff that worked here. They were awesome. They were on board. And 
my caseload just grew from there. 
Ethan (00:27:28): 
And then, so you do the one-on-one, do you do any group? 
Bobby (00:27:34): 
I don't here. At the Shepherd's House, I did. During this whole time, I was running community. I was, I was 
doing a group a week. 
Ethan (00:27:45): 
At Shepherd's House while you were still here? 
Bobby (00:27:56): 
Yeah, yeah. Let's see, what else? 
Ethan (00:27:56): 
But that was just like as a volunteer? 
Bobby (00:27:56): 
No, the way they paid me, there was free rent. I had my own place, like in the attic. It was like a finished 
attic. It was really nice. And I didn't have to pay rent for it, so that, that's kinda how they compensated 
me for working there. And then I worked here for, for my paycheck, you know. So life kept going really 
good. I've met, I met my girlfriend, who I'm still in a relationship with during this, this little time stint that 
9 
 
were talking about right now. I actually met her originally at Recovery Works, when I worked there for like 
two months. She's a phlebotomist that draws blood, and we got to talking and, and you know, liked each 
other. She's also in recovery. She's been sober a little bit longer than me, and we started really the first 
healthy relationship that I've ever been in. 
Bobby (00:28:57): 
And it's just progressed. We've been in a relationship now for, for two years. And, and we're about to 
move into a house together. So that's been also like some big steps, some big progress in my life. Because 
I've been, I've been used to getting in very toxic relationships, but now through the recovery process, you 
kind of learn, you know, the ways of how a healthy relationship is supposed to be. And, and she's great. 
We just went to the, we went on vacation not too long ago, and she has a son. So that's an adjustment 
for me, but it's just so healthy, like. So I worked here for, for about a year, I'd say in that capacity of 
meeting with clients one-on-one, having a caseload. Yeah.  
Ethan (00:29:55): 
It's interesting though, that they have this training, that they had the training here, but they didn't really 
know when you started, that they didn't really know when you started what to do with you. 
Bobby (00:30:11): 
The lady that was doing the class at that time, she was you know, a licensed therapist, and she was in a 
completely different building. Didn't really have anything, any say in this building. It was kind of separate 
locations. So yeah, about a year goes by and I, I just continue to kind of chip away at improving what I'm 
doing here. Then, I also went back and got youth certified, so that I could work on this floor and, and the 
second floor is just youth. So now I can like bounce back and forth and help them out. Cause they don't 
have a peer that works up there. So I saw an opportunity. I saw a gap where children weren't getting peer 
services. So I went, they paid for it. I came back. And during that process, like I said, this was about a year 
after I started working here, I was approached with a job opportunity to work for the state with youth. 
And, and my youth peer support certificate qualified me for it. And it was a little bit of a bump in pay, 
more responsibility. I saw it as an opportunity to grow and learn more things. So, I ended up putting in my 
two weeks here, and New Vista actually counter offered it. And, and wanted me to take on this new role 
of a senior peer support specialist in charge of all the peer support services at New Vista and kind of get 
them going in the right direction. They also wanted me to run the peer support training and doing other 
trainings throughout the company. I ended up taking it. So, I took on the role as the senior peer. And it's, 
it's been awesome. I've been able to do things like, I was able to get all the peers a dollar raise right off 
the rip. It was the first thing. And what that did was then that it got all of the peers that worked here kind 
of on board with wanting to improve some things. 
Ethan (00:32:17): 
How many were here? 
Bobby (00:32:19): 
At that time I think there was maybe 10. So over the two years that I worked here, they started, with 
people spread around. Mechanic Street, here in Lexington, there's a few that work there. The Schwartz 
Center has some inpatient peers that work there. And then, yeah, sporadic. So I started off just working 
with the outpatient peers, getting them up to speed. I had a goal of getting double the amount of peers 
working here. I reached that goal. The way that I went about that was, so, so peers are allowed to bill 
10 
 
Medicaid for services. And at the time of me taking on the senior peer role, there was no standard for 
hours a month. So there were peers that were only getting 10 hours a month billing Medicaid. So what I 
did was I implemented a reasonable goal of 50 hours a month. So doing that makes New Vista more 
money. And, and even though that's not what it's all about when you're talking to, you know, CEOs and, 
or the finance people, Hey, let's hire some more peers because now you're actually making money off of 
them. Then I get them on board. Then I, then I'm able to hire more peers, and then we're able to help 
more clients. So it's kind of like, you have to work it from both angles. 
Ethan (00:33:49): 
But they can work full-time with just the 50? There are other pots of money? I just want to clarify, because 
some people might think it's like a part-time gig, but it is full-time. 
Bobby (00:34:04): 
It's full-time, yeah. The 50 hours is just productivity. That means for 50 hours, you're sitting across from 
another, from a client, and you're doing billable services that you're allowed. Yeah. So, even outside of 
that 50 hours, you're still working. You're still, you know doing notes, sending emails, even groups, talking 
to therapists. You're still doing stuff, but that's the productivity number. So, yeah, so that's, and we just 
kept on, like I said, chipping away and progressing the peer support. I started doing the training, which 
was awesome. I've kind of found a passion and love for training, being in front of people. 
Ethan (00:34:48): 
Did you do it for the two years, or for how many years have you done the training? 
Bobby (00:34:51): 
The training, I've just been doing it for the last year. So when I took this senior peer support role was when 
I started doing it. So, that's the other thing that we've, so the other thing that I've changed is that before 
we were only doing, we were only doing it once every three months, and now we're doing it every other 
month. And we're also, we have, let's see, what's the word I'm looking for? We have, we used to top out 
at like 20, 25 people, and now it's closer to 50, so we have more people coming in. I got it out of the 
smaller conference room. We got it into the bigger conference room. Obviously we haven't been doing 
that because of social distancing and COVID, but when we start back up, we'll be able to hold 50 people 
and get a lot more people trained. 
Ethan (00:35:55): 
And they don't repeat it. It's, it's a first time thing? 
Bobby (00:35:58): 
Yeah, it's a week long. Yeah. It's a week long, 30 hour. When you get done with it, you're a certified peer. 
There are certain things that you have to keep up with it. Six hours of continuing education. You have to 
meet with professionals to go over supervision half an hour, twice a month. Like there's little things that 
you have to do to keep it up to date. If you don't then, yeah, you would have to retake it. But so yeah, 
that's, that's kind of where I'm at today is, we've been improving things. I'm actually about to leave New 
Vista. I've taken, I've taken another job. I've already, I've already put in, I've already put in my notice. But 
I got, I got offered a job at a new place called Roaring Brook as an outreach coordinator slash senior peer 
support specialist. So they want me to, they want me to be over, over the peer services at this place and 
also be the outreach coordinator. So it's just, it's over on Alumni. So it's just another, like I said, at the 
11 
 
beginning, I'm, I'm looking for as many growing opportunities as I can. I've been working there part-time, 
working on their policies and procedures, which is completely out of my wheelhouse of expertise. 
Ethan (00:37:22): 
So is it a new place? 
Bobby (00:37:23): 
It's a new place. Yeah. So that's kind of my, my next adventure, my new adventure. 
Ethan (00:37:31): 
That's the competition. 
Bobby (00:37:31): 
It's different. It's a little different. 
Ethan (00:37:33): 
It's a different program, I guess. 
Bobby (00:37:37): 
Yeah. So yeah. 
Ethan (00:37:39): 
So you said, since you started in that role as senior support, senior peer support specialist, the numbers 
have grown, the numbers of peer support specialists have grown. So, so it was at 10, and how many is at 
now? 
Bobby (00:37:55): 
I think we have 25 organization wide, and I was wanting to grow it more. Like my plan was, was to continue 
to grow it. And you know, I've been doing some work kind of on the side too. There's, there's a movement 
in Frankfort that's trying to gain information on peer support. The, the problem is that the peer support 
is really hard. 
Ethan (00:38:21): 
You mean a movement in the legislature? 
Bobby (00:38:24): 
In, oh, what's the name of it? I wish I had my laptop up. It's KP. It's just there there's a lady who is trying 
to get basically the Medicaid regs higher billable. So like, so, so they're trying to get as much information 
as they can to, to show Medicaid how important these services are, so that they can bill at a higher rate 
hourly. Well, the problem is it's hard to get information on peer support in a data chart or in a graph, like 
what I told you about a second ago, the keep rate, like that's, that's the kind of stuff that they're looking 
for so that they can present that, Hey, these people are coming back because of this service. We need to 
bill at a higher rate. If that happens, then we can pay peers more money. Because right now it's a very 
low, it's a very low start out wage that should be higher for what peers actually do. I am a huge advocate 
12 
 
on getting peers more money so that they can have a good life, if that makes sense. So that's kind of also, 
that's like a little side gig that I've been working on, like trying to help out with that. 
Ethan (00:39:52): 
I have heard that was an issue. And insurance companies, do they allow for payment for peer support 
services? 
Bobby (00:40:01): 
The Medicaid does. 
Ethan (00:40:05): 
But like private insurance? 
Bobby (00:40:05): 
Private insurance, not that I know of. That's, that's a little out of my expertise. I know that working here, 
I'm not allowed to work with a client with private insurance. I have it worked out to where I can do it. I 
have it worked out to where I can do it pro bono and do notes, but I won't, I won't be able to bill for it. So 
sometimes people are like, well, if you're not billing for it, you shouldn't be working with them. You know, 
so there's a lot of like, kind of tension there sometimes, but I would like, so I'm assuming that now you 
can't bill for it, if they're, if they're. 
Ethan (00:40:49): 
I just don't know. I mean, I've, I've heard that you couldn't, but it could be changing. 
Bobby (00:40:54): 
I think it should. Absolutely. Because just because somebody has a certain type of insurance, shouldn't 
cancel them out of a service that might help them. And as far as. I'm kinda all over the place. 
Ethan (00:41:11): 
No, you're good. You're right on track. I was going to ask you, but as you, as you're now in this role, do 
you still have the case load too, in addition to overseeing everything? 
Bobby (00:41:18): 
That was actually one of my stipulations of staying is that I wanted to continue even with just a small 
caseload, because I love working in the trenches. I love, that's like part of the rewarding side of the job is 
to work with someone and see that light bulb come on for them to progress in life. That's what kind of 
reenergizes me. So I said, you know, this is what I want to do, but I also want to keep a caseload, and they 
were very okay with it. So, it definitely dialed back a lot just because I have so much other things going 
on. 
Ethan (00:42:00): 
Well I, I wanted just to see, maybe if you could talk more about the training and the sessions that you run 
and what's involved in that. And you said you really enjoy it. So what do you enjoy about, well, what are 
some, what are some interesting pieces of it? 
13 
 
Bobby (00:42:21): 
Yeah, so we do a 30 hour. It's, it's mandatory to be a certified peer support specialist here in Kentucky. 
You have to, you have to complete a 30 hour course, and then take a test at the end. So we've devised 
one, submitted it, and got approved. We brought it back. And now, we do the training. What it goes over 
is really a little bit of everything. Trauma informed care, suicide prevention, history of behavioral health. 
And then we also get like really in-depth on peer support services. So we, we go through what a peer 
support is, like really elementary type stuff, all the way to situations that might arise. We go through 
boundaries and ethics. We also provide a lot of resources. It's really cool because I do a lot of, I did a lot 
of groups at Shepherd's House, and I would use a lot of the material during the group. So, so the, the 
packet comes with a lot of material on facing one's fears, avenues of change, goal setting. So we go 
through, and hopefully, it's a, it's a small amount of time. It's only 30 hours, but hopefully, it's enough 
information to get people started. 
Ethan (00:43:45): 
And right at the end of the week, they take tests? 
Bobby (00:43:47): 
So it's, it's the way it's graded is it's class participation. There's a written test, and there's an oral test. So 
class participation, as long as you're there, as long as you've said a few things here and there, you get that. 
And then the written test, you know, we go through, it's a lot of information. So, I tell people to study at 
the end of every day, just kind of refresh yourself. But you know, I've, I've, it's, it's, it's pretty easy if you've 
been present the whole week, you know. So, they take the written test, and then we have a few volunteers 
that work here that come over. And for the oral test, they sit down across from someone. That person 
asks them three or four kind of open-ended questions. And then you kind of grade on what they're, what 
they're saying. Then, they wait about a week, and they get a notification with their certificate, and they’re 
peer support certified. 
Ethan (00:44:48): 
Usually people don't have to retake the class? It doesn't happen very often, right? 
Bobby (00:44:57): 
I helped out with it the first year that I worked here, here and there, like a day here and a day there. So I 
talked to the lady who did it before me, she did it for a few years, and I've never had anybody fail it. And 
she said, she's only had one person ever. It's, yeah, if you can internalize what's being said, you're going 
to do fine. And that's what I've heard. There are a lot of different courses out there that will get you peer 
support certified. I think NAMI has one. There's another guy that I know that does one on the weekends. 
But the content has to meet the standard. So for them to put on the class, they have to submit their 
curriculum. It has to be approved. So it's all very, very similar. It might just be slightly different styles of 
how it's facilitated. 
Ethan (00:45:53): 
And, and do, do you have opportunities to share your story in that, in that setting, and the other, other 
folks do they share? 
Bobby (00:46:07): 
14 
 
The cool thing about it is, is that the requirement is that you have to have two certified peers in the 
classroom at all times during the whole week. So, so I take care of one of them. But then I get to pull 
another peer in the organization over for that week, and throughout the whole thing, what I usually tell 
them is, and this is the way that I view it, I go over the material. And then I sprinkle some of my personal 
experience on top of it, and that's kind of the mindset behind. So, so by the end of the week, yeah, the 
class is going to know a lot of my story. And then, so you have to have two peers, and then one other 
person who's in the organization. It doesn't have to be any particular person, but I usually, what I do, what 
I've done is I'll, I'll pull like a different therapist every day. And I think that adds to the training. It adds to 
like another perspective, perception, you know. So that's kinda how we do ours here. 
Ethan (00:47:10): 
So you get different therapists from the organization every day? 
Bobby (00:47:12): 
Yeah. Cause there's some, and, and that's just from like getting to know them so well, I know some people 
really enjoy talking about trauma informed care, so I'm gonna make sure that I try to schedule them for 
that one, you know. Suicide prevention, culture competency. Those are usually some of the bigger ones 
that I like therapists to do because they're usually a little more knowledgeable about it than I am. But then 
I, like, I like doing like boundaries and ethics cause I, I feel very passionate about that. So, I try to get 
whoever is facilitating that particular section to be kind of in their wheelhouse of knowledge and also 
maybe a little passion behind that. Usually, it usually comes off pretty well. 
Ethan (00:48:04): 
It's crazy that there's so much, so many classes now being offered, so many training programs, but you 
still get so many people per session. 
Bobby (00:48:18): 
It's pretty nuts. Up until this COVID stuff started, we would fill up the seats within a week or two, two at 
the most. That's why we switched it to every other month because we saw a demand for it. And even now 
with how many seats we have open, it's like, they're still filling up quick. Like we could probably do it every 
month and still have majority of the seats filled up. 
Ethan (00:48:45): 
And when you went through the training, there wasn't that many people doing it? 
Bobby (00:48:50): 
No, it was still fairly, fairly new. It's really caught on over the last couple of years, really caught on, because 
back then, not, not a lot of people really even knew about it. I think the class that I took, we maybe had 
like 15 people in there. And, and some empty seats in the back and, and back then they were only doing 
it once every three months. So it was very like word of mouth. You know, so it's a fairly, it's a fairly new 
position overall. I think they, they just got it approved to be billable through Medicaid within the last like 
10, 15 years. So, I know that seems like a long time, but it's a fairly new position. 
Ethan (00:49:34): 
15 
 
Yeah. I mean, what do you think, why, why do you think that it's suddenly sort of grown? There's more 
jobs, but what's going on? 
Bobby (00:49:47): 
I think, it's just taken a while to, to catch on, to understand like what helps and what doesn't. 
Ethan (00:49:57): 
So, even within the organizations they're realizing [inaudible]. 
Bobby (00:50:02): 
Yeah, I do a history class on, on addiction, and I do another one that's on behavioral health. I do one that's 
on, just healthcare in general. And like, I mean, the advances that we've made in healthcare, like a hundred 
years ago, people thought that bloodletting was a good idea, you know. So like we, we just, in that aspect, 
mental health is even more of a baby. And substance abuse treatment is even more of a baby. So, I think 
people are just now starting to catch on, you know, I get, I get the opportunity to talk to, to directors of 
other facilities who got started 20, 30 years ago. And they tell me like, how things were back then. And 
I'm just like, oh, wow. It was so, yeah, it was just naive to what things really work. I think they, I think a lot 
of ideas have been taken from like the 12 step community. One alcoholic helping another alcoholic, one 
addict helping another addict has been working in the AA community since 1939. And I've noticed that 
trend. It seems like a lot of that stuff catches on 10, 15 years later. And this is one of the things that I think 
is finally starting to catch on. And, and now we're starting to see where we can put it into data. We can, 
we can share it with each other, Hey, these are the benefits, you know. So I think it just takes some time, 
but I think it's going in the right direction. And then the other side of it is that I think it helps me working 
in this field. 
Bobby (00:51:53): 
It reinforces my own recovery. And I think that that's why a lot of people take that class they're in the 
same boat that I was when I was first wanting to take the class. Like I find that's maybe my higher calling. 
I want to be able to transform all of this horrible stuff that I've been through into something positive. 
There's nowhere else I can go that I can do that, you know. So I think that that's probably, talking to the 
people that are going through the class, that seems to be a common denominator of why they're taking 
it is, I want to reinforce my own recovery and make, make these things that I've been through into 
something that can help someone else. And so I think that's why I see a lot of people going through there. 
Ethan (00:52:40): 
One question that I get, you probably get this too, is what's the difference between--I kind of know, but 
I’ll just let you answer it--what's the difference between an AA sponsor and a peer support specialist? So 
how's their relationship different? 
Bobby (00:52:55): 
The, the peer support is a peer professional. So like, I am on equal playing when I'm working with a client, 
I'm on equal ground with them. But I'm, I have a job. I'm hired, I'm held to a professional standard. There's 
a lot of boundaries there. I do have less boundaries than a therapist, but I still have boundaries. And I 
think that once you start to, that's why I love doing that class is. I can talk about this for an hour, but there 
are certain lines that I cannot cross or I start hurting that client, if that makes sense. Like, I can't go out 
here and go to the movie theater and act like I'm friends with this person or become friends with this 
16 
 
person, because then that's going to hurt our professional part of our relationship here. Whereas a 
sponsor, you don't have those same boundary issues, right. This is more of a relationship, right. Sponsor, 
sponsee. So that's kind of the, I think the big difference is there's more boundaries. 
Ethan (00:54:10): 
When I first started talking about this project with the person at the Library of Congress who is overseeing 
it, she asked me that question. 
Bobby (00:54:21): 
And that's the big thing too, that I have been trying to advocate. There's this, there's this stigma around 
peer support specialists that I've seen from everybody else in the organization that we have to be really 
careful and walk on eggshells around this person, because I don't want to upset them and have them 
relapse. And that's the opposite of what peer support need in organizations. I need to be viewed as a 
professional. I need to be held to the same standard. You know, you need to disciplinary, you know, write 
me up if I do something wrong. You need to congratulate me if I do something right. Exactly what you do 
with these other therapists. I've had conversations with, with directors and other people who have that 
mindset, you know, we are just gonna, you know, have the kiddy gloves on handling peer support. And 
that takes away the whole meaningful purpose of being in this professional role for me. Like, I want to be 
viewed as a professional, you know. So that's something else that I've, I've had lots of discussions with 
people about. And other peers feel the same way. 
Ethan (00:55:50): 
And you feel it's getting better? 
Bobby (00:55:52): 
It is. It absolutely is. 
Ethan (00:55:55): 
Well, you're, you're a pioneer. There's extra stuff to deal with. 
Bobby (00:56:02): 
Oh yeah, yeah. There's another thing that I was able to do, this kind of goes back a little bit. But I was able 
to go get BIP certified, which is batterer intervention program, and that's been a cool little like side project 
for me. I tried to apply for it. They said that I needed a college education, and I actually wrote a couple of 
emails and called a few people and actually got it approved. They rewrote the, the regs for it. And they're 
going to allow peer support specialists in good standing with Medicaid to take that now. So, so I was able 
to take that, I think it was in February, and now I'm trained where I can, I can do batterer intervention 
trainings. So it's always like-- 
Ethan (00:56:56): 
That's on the state level they give that out? 
Bobby (00:56:59): 
Yeah. So and I work, I actually work, I'm slightly a workaholic. So, over the last year, I've been doing one 
group a week for this private practice, and she does batterer intervention. And then I do the substance 
17 
 
abuse portion of it. So if somebody comes in there who has been court ordered to take this class, and she 
does an assessment and sees that there's drugs or alcohol involved in their story. She pops them over to, 
to my class also. So we get to address both issues. So that's kind of how I got introduced to it. And I was 
like, I kind of wanted to see what, what this is about too. So you made me think of it as far as the pioneering 
some of this stuff. It's, it's been a journey. It feels sometimes like it's an uphill climb, but looking back over 
the last two years, it's amazing how much progress has been made, you know, and not just by me, but the 
other people who advocate for this service. 
Ethan (00:58:06): 
Yeah. So you talked a little about, about like your relationships with the therapists and clinicians. What 
about, you know, among peer support specialists? You know, as more people are getting trained and 
you've got more people coming in, what's the relationship like between all, among all of you? You feel like 
you're a professional community? 
Bobby (00:58:35): 
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it's, it's good. It's good to have, cause I worked here without any other peer support, 
any other peer support support, for like the first year that I worked here. So now that we have a lot more, 
and I've started up a text chain where all the peer outpatient peers have a group message. We send out 
group emails. We've actually started doing a staffing once a month where all the outpatient peers get on 
Zoom. So, it's just a lot more support, you know what I mean? And you know, we get to bounce ideas off 
each other. And I think everybody kind of really likes everybody else. Like there's not, there's not a lot of 
drama. There's not a lot of tension. We all, we all kind of have a bond, if that makes sense. Just where 
everybody who's a peer has obviously had some very rough issues in the past. It kind of bonds you a little 
bit. So even though it's like maybe a brand new peer that I've never met, before we start off the 
conversation with kind of knowing that about each other. And there's a little bit more of a bond there 
than it would with someone else. So I think all the peers really get along with each other in this 
organization as far as I can see. 
Ethan (00:59:55): 
You check in pretty regularly and share what's going on? 
Bobby (00:59:58): 
Exactly. Yeah, exactly. And again, it was just from, from my own experience of kind of being alone for the 
first year. I saw a need for it. You know, I was like, I was going through some, some issues where like, I go 
to staffing once a week, but it's, it's five or six therapists and a doctor and a director, you know. So like 
some of the issues that I'm having with clients, these other people can't really identify with. They don't 
really have any feedback for me. They don't have any advice. So starting this up was like one of the first 
big things I wanted to do so that we could bounce ideas off each other. We're struggling with a lot of the 
same stuff. So just having that support, like I said, peer support support, you know. 
Ethan (01:00:47): 
It's like, could you give an example, like something without being too specific? 
Bobby (01:00:55): 
It's kind of, it's kind of a black and white, like easy thing when I say it out loud, but there was a peer that 
was having a lot of issue with some boundaries as far as a client that she just stopped working with was 
18 
 
wanting her to sponsor her in AA. And, and she was kind of in this dilemma, like, should I do it? Should I 
not do it? She talked about it. We talked about it. And ultimately decided that it was a bad idea. That we 
have policies that extend two years past services that you're not supposed to have a relationship. I was 
like, you know at the end of the day, that's kind of how I handle my situations is, I look at the policies I 
look at, you know, is there something against this? Well, there is. So I try to follow that. Some of the other 
people shared some of their experience with it. And what's really cool is that I think that the peer 
community is very understanding that people make mistakes a lot more than, than most other groups, if 
that makes sense. So I mean, I've had people in there discuss some mess ups that they've done that are 
pretty serious, but it's like, nobody really cares as far as like, they're not judgmental. Like, oh my God, how 
could you do that? You know, it's like, oh, well, you know, learning opportunity, like, you know not to do 
that again, you know. 
Ethan (01:02:21): 
They're more understanding and forgiving? 
Bobby (01:02:21): 
Yeah, yeah. I had an, I had an opportunity to grow. This was before I took the senior peer support position. 
There was an elderly man who came in here one day, and he didn't have anywhere to go that night. He 
had a substance abuse issue. And I tried everything I could to get him in somewhere to stay that night. He 
was in a wheelchair. He had been banned from the Hope Center homeless shelter. He couldn't go to the 
other homeless shelter because of the wheelchair. All this stuff. And, and I gave him my personal number, 
which is a big no-no here. Later on that night, he calls me. I'm on a date with my girlfriend. He calls me, 
he's at the hospital, they're discharging him. He doesn't have anywhere to go. He's just going to be sitting 
in his wheelchair all night. He pulled at my heart strings. I actually drove to the hospital. I picked him up. 
I let him stay at the Shepherd's House that night. Right. I tried to get him in somewhere the next day, 
couldn't get him in anywhere. 
Bobby (01:03:25): 
I ended up on the phone with the state, and they sent out a, it's an APS worker, adult protective services. 
A caseworker came here, all the way from Frankfort, sit down with him. They actually got him into a 
nursing home, got him a bed and everything. And at the very last minute, he decided he did not want to 
go. He had someone coming to pick him up. So he wheeled out. And he called me every night for the next 
month asking if he could stay with me. I ended up having to block his number, cause it was the same thing 
over and over. He was just in that cycle and wasn't willing to get out of it. And that was like one of the big 
learning opportunities for me. Okay, so this might be why we don't give our personal number out. Cause, 
cause after I blocked him, my iPhone, you can go in and look at blocked voicemails. So, so I blocked him, 
and then I think like two or three weeks later, I was scrolling through, and I saw it. And I clicked on it, and 
there was probably 50 voicemails from him. And I listened to a couple of them, and they were all the 
same. Hey, they're discharging me from the hospital. I was wondering if you could help me out. The next 
one was, I need a ride to so-and-so place, you know, weekends. So you know, that's, that's expected. And 
I tell a lot of people that story like, like, because I think it helps, you know, it helps as far as like my 
experience so that you don't do that. And also too for people to understand, especially other peers, that 
like, Hey, we're gonna make mistakes. You know. Like, and, and, and it's not a, it's not a death sentence. 
Like you learn from it, you grow from it, you move on. And that's kinda what this position has been a lot 
for me through this process. 
Ethan (01:05:22): 
19 
 
So it's trial and error. You didn't have anybody to talk to, any other peer support specialists, right? Well I 
think we can move on to talking about, well, let's, let's talk first about like, you know, sort of, what do you 
think are sort of, sort of the keys to being successful as a peer support specialist? 
Bobby (01:05:56): 
I think one of the biggest things is just having a very solid recovery for yourself. And what that looks like 
is, it looks different for everybody, but for me, continuing to work my AA program, right. Talking to my 
sponsor, sponsoring other guys, going to meetings outside of work hours. Volunteering at places. I 
volunteer at a place called Recovery Cafe, like doing that stuff that kind of feeds my soul. And then also 
being self-aware when, when things are starting to drain me and knowing when to do self-care. I told you 
that I'm kind of a workaholic. So it's very important for me to be aware when I need to take some self-
care, when I need to, you know, chill out one weekend and cook out and just watch some TV, or go to the 
lake, or you know. Like that's, that's probably one of the biggest things that I've seen, I've seen be 
detrimental to peers. I've seen a lot of peers relapse because they start making this work their recovery. 
I see them starting to get so frustrated, and they don't take care of themselves. And then they just pop. 
And next thing you know, they're drinking, they're using again. Self-care is, is, is something that I preach 
constantly to all peers cause it's so important. 
Ethan (01:07:30): 
What would they get, their source of frustration would be...? 
Bobby (01:07:35): 
Trying to help someone who doesn't want help. Or even like the little stuff that I've been talking about 
today. I want to help someone who doesn't have private insurance, right. That can be very frustrating. Or 
you know, having some issues with another professional that works here, you know, maybe there's a 
doctor, that's doing stuff that you don't agree with. Just anything that can kind of, that stuff builds up 
almost like, like a tea kettle, and sometimes you just have to hit that release valve and let some of that 
steam out. So healthy ways to do that is, is, is vital for this type of work. And then communication is 
probably one of the other big keys that I also preach about. You have to develop healthy and, and, and 
good communication skills for the client's benefit and then also for your own for, for the other people in 
the organization, the people that you're working next to, like when I first started here, like I said, I was 
having a lot of trouble in staffings, talking to other therapists, but just because I wasn't used to the lingo. 
I wasn't used to the language. I had to develop that stuff. I had to learn how to talk professionally in this 
field, you know. 
Ethan (01:08:56): 
Like what would be an example of something that you had to learn? 
Bobby (01:09:00): 
So this is kind of embarrassing. Let's see. What is it? Ambivalence. I remember that word being used a 
couple of times, like in one of my first staffings. And I was involved in talking about some stuff and the 
whole time I'm thinking, like, I have no idea what that word means. You know. When people are diagnosed 
with certain things, I didn't know what substance abuse moderate was, you know, like terminology like 
that. Let's see. What are some other ones? 
Ethan (01:09:39): 
20 
 
I just was curious, you know, just to kind of see what, what were some of the things you had to pick up 
on. 
Bobby (01:09:46): 
It was just a, it was a shock to me, shock to my system. 
Ethan (01:09:51): 
But now you're good? 
Bobby (01:09:51): 
Yeah, absolutely. Like I can hang with all of them now. But yeah, there was just-- 
Ethan (01:09:59): 
And I imagine a lot of other folks encounter that too. 
Bobby (01:10:00): 
Yeah. And it's cool because a lot of the stuff that I've experienced, I've been able to incorporate into this 
training. Hopefully getting some of them exposed to some of the difficulties that I had before they even 
get to that point. So I talk a lot about, Hey, you know, there might be a language difference when you first 
start working. Cause, cause a lot of these peers have gone through rehabs, AA background. Language is 
very different between a 12 step program and a clinical, you know, program. So we go over all of that. I 
tell them personal stories. So it's, it's cool. The other peer that's usually working with me, we'll talk, talk 
about it, but it's pretty common. Like everybody that I've talked to, they're like, yeah, like it's different, 
it's hard to follow it at first, but then eventually you start to pick up things. 
Ethan (01:10:57): 
Yeah. So that's part of the communication skills, learning that language, being able to move between 
different groups. 
Bobby (01:11:04): 
Yeah. And learning, you know, all the trainings that we have for person centered, is all about the client 
kind of choosing their pathway. That's the other, that's probably the other biggest thing that I've seen is, 
is the majority of peers, majority, are usually from a 12 step background, and they have, they have certain 
beliefs, they have certain like core beliefs, that they have learned that this is what works for me, this is 
what's gonna work for you. And getting them away from that and understanding that, Hey, there's a lot 
of different pathways in recovery. Recovery, you know, AA doesn't have the copyright on recovery. That 
medically assisted treatment is successful, you know, done, done the right way. Getting people on board 
with that is another thing that I've seen people struggle with. You know, AA teaches you abstinence is the 
only way. That's not the case, you know. 
Ethan (01:12:16): 
But people are beginning to accept that, I'd say. 
Bobby (01:12:18): 
Yeah. That's another one of those things, just chipping away at it slowly. 
21 
 
Ethan (01:12:25): 
Well, I think that kind of gets us to like the last few questions, you know, just, you know, issues, challenges. 
You kind of already addressed what, you know, what you find most rewarding and some of your successes. 
So, as you're looking toward how the profession's growing, what are some issues or challenges that you 
want to talk about more? What do you see the future being for the profession? 
Bobby (01:12:55): 
I mean, the biggest, I'd say probably the biggest thing on my scope right now is, is getting the money, the 
salary higher. I have already kind of talked a little bit about that, but I think that that's probably going to 
be one of the most important things. And I have discussed with other directors and other professionals, 
like some ways to, to do this. But for example, other than when I got the senior peer position, every peer 
support that worked in New Vista, they get hired as a peer support specialist. And then you're just kind of 
in that role indefinitely, you know. So I, I think that you need to develop some hierarchy, something that 
you can work towards. I'm very, I'm very goal oriented just because that is what helps me. That's what 
kind of person I am. So if you have me coming in on the entry level peer support, I want to know that I 
have the opportunity to advance and three, four, or five years, with the experience, to senior peer support 
specialist or to move up to this. 
Bobby (01:14:06): 
And so that's something that I think we need to start taking a look at because it's the same everywhere. 
There's, all peer support or peer support, and I've talked to New Vista actually about having like a senior 
peer support in each hub and then other peers under them, and then having a top dog peer, and having 
this, this system where you can work your way up, make a little bit more money. Giving people a goal in 
front of them to work towards. So, that's something that, that I think should be implemented. I don't know 
if it will. But you know, everybody's trying to advance, and it can get disheartening after working 
somewhere for two or three years and you're just spinning your wheels in the same spot. 
Ethan (01:14:57): 
On top of the other frustrations. So for people providing, just to clarify, you know, of folks providing 
services, peer support specialists would be sort of the low end on the pay scale. 
Bobby (01:15:15): 
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I don't think it's a secret. It's usually, from all the places that I've looked at working or 
people that I've heard working, it's usually somewhere between $10 and $14 an hour. 
Ethan (01:15:31): 
But that can go up over time? 
Bobby (01:15:34): 
No. That's, that's, that's where it's at, you know, until somebody comes in and convinces them to give 
everybody a dollar raise. That's, that's where they're at. Even some of these smaller counties, I've heard 
of like smaller treatment facilities and like $8, $9. So it's, it's something that we need to work on. I think 
that we are going in the right direction though, because when I first started two years ago, $12 was like, 
seemed like the magic number. Now t's seeming more like 13, 14, so it's moving that direction, you know. 
And then also, I mean, just kind of a hope shot for, for anybody that is listening or anybody that you talk 
22 
 
to, like there is room to improve yourself like, kind of like what I'm doing right now. This new senior peer 
support position that I got here a year ago is quite a bit more. This new place that I'm going to next is 
going to be actually double. So like there are opportunities out there. You just, I want those entry levels 
and the people who fall in love with a company and want to stick with them, I want them to, to be able 
to survive life. You know, I couldn't have, I couldn't have lived the life that I wanted to live originally 
working here, if I hadn't been at the Shepherd's House with free rent, you know. I would've, I would've 
struggled. I want people to be able to live comfortably because they're, they're, they're putting in a lot of 
work. I mean, this is an emotionally draining job. And people should be compensated for that, you know? 
Cause I'm, I'm giving a lot of myself every time that I sit across from someone and really get in depth on 
like some real struggles, and I'm sharing my personal experience. That's, that's a piece of me, you know. 
So yeah, I think the, the financial backing, the money aspect of it is still probably the number one thing in 
my head that I would like to see change just because I think it's, it almost makes it seem like peers are 
undervalued, you know. 
Ethan (01:18:03): 
Yeah. It seems like if they're providing more training opportunities, like you took advantage of, you found 
training opportunities and were able to build up your skills, but maybe not everyone knows where to look. 
If that were more par for the course, that might lead to people moving up into different roles. 
Bobby (01:18:18): 
The other thing, and I don't, I don't see it, I'm not, I'm not trying to say anything about any of the places 
that I've worked, but I've heard stories and I've talked to people who've experienced it, but there's some 
tension between other professionals and peers sometimes that I don't think it's talked about enough. You 
know, a therapist, I heard that there was a therapist who wasn't very nice to a peer, not in this 
organization, but because she didn't have a college degree, you know. And I've also heard of peers not 
really liking doctors or therapists because they have no real experience. Right. They don't know what it's 
really like out there. And I think one of the things that I also go over in this training a lot is that like, we 
are a piece of the pie. There's this whole pie, and we are all here for the client. 
Bobby (01:19:28): 
And your piece is completely different from this piece over here. Like we're not the same, but we need all 
of us to be able to serve this client. And, and to get your head wrapped around that. This isn't a 
competition to see how many people I can [help] say versus you. This is, does this client, would this client 
benefit from my services, right. Or would they benefit more from, from just therapy or, you know. And 
that's been my experience, like every client that comes through here is different. Some of them respond 
to me much, much better. Some of them respond to a therapist much, much better, you know. And not 
like being offended by that or anything. We're, at the end of the day, here to help as many people as we 
can, you know. So that would probably be another thing that would be on my radar of things I would like 
to see, like that shouldn't even be a factor, you know. But I've heard that it is. 
Ethan (01:20:34): 
Yeah. I mean, that pretty much covers it. I don't, I don't want to take too much more of your time, but you 
have anything that you want to add. You have hope for peer support services? 
Bobby (01:20:50): 
23 
 
I do. I think you know, it's, it's, it's kind of shocking to me sometimes to think about kind of where I've 
come from. Being that like at a certain point in my life, there was a six month period where like I was 
homeless, you know fiending for, for any mood altering substance I could get my hands on. Doing all the 
shady stuff that goes along with it, and to like, be able to see where I've made it today. And, and it has 
been a huge, the peer support role has helped me tremendously on growing as a person. It's, it's hard for 
me to put into words how, how grateful I am that the people behind me were able to conjure up this 
position, you know, and to put all the legwork in to get me to that position where I'm working at Five Guys 
and I'm like, Hey, I want to make a little change. Hey, there's a peer support training. You don't have to 
have a college education to start working in this. You're gonna love it. Like people put a lot of work in 
before I got here, you know, and, and I'm very grateful for, for all the progress that they made before I 
got here and that other people are making right now. It's just cool. And I think the sky's the limit for this 
as, as people get more and more on board with it. 
Ethan (01:22:22): 
You're continuing to build the foundation for what will come. 
Bobby (01:22:24): 
Yeah. And that's, and that's what, that's what I think you know, other peers, I think, need to be advocates 
for this as well, you know. And I think they are. I think some have different attributes than others, you 
know. I, I'm a little more outspoken and direct when I, what I want to, to communicate what I need or 
what I want. Some other people might be a little more passive, but I think that, you know, we just keep, 
we keep advocating for these services and, and what we want and what we need. And I think that they'll 
get there, you know, over time. 
Ethan (01:23:04): 
Well, it's exciting. It's an exciting development for the profession. Who knows, in the future, it may just 
be sort of an established role in pretty much every organization. 
Bobby (01:23:23): 
I think it would be cool to actually add on to the peer support specialist job, like have a whole new type 
of job out there, where you still take the 30 hour course, but then the employer pays or puts on a training, 
a slow training, throughout like a two year period where you're even like more certified and gives you and 
gives you like a higher rate of pay for your qualifications cause you've done all this training. Like there's, 
there's so many different possibilities, like, so I think people who get ideas of how to progress this, throw 
them out there, and try some different things out, you know. That's what they had to do when this thing 
first started, you know, Hey, I have an idea. What if we got someone who used to have some issues in 
their past, and we got them to work with these clients? Like I bet people looked at them really silly at first. 
Ethan (01:24:24): 
They were doing that in AA, or some version of it. Well, I have to ask you about the, this real quick, the 
impact of the pandemic on your organization? 
Bobby (01:24:32): 
It's had, it's had an impact, I think, on, on therapy, but what's funny is that the peer support numbers have 
actually gone up. Medicaid has approved billable phone calls, billable Zoom meetings. And as far as I know, 
not speaking about therapy sessions or doctor appointments, but just the peer support services have 
24 
 
actually gone way up. Because we're able to, I had a lot of fail to keeps throughout the week. You know, 
people wouldn't show up, but people will, will pick up the phone and just talk for a little bit. So I think that 
has a big impact on it, as far as like seeing the numbers actually go up. We took a little bit of a dip when 
we were first getting used to it, like literally like half a month and then boom, skyrocketed. 
Bobby (01:25:30): 
It's actually been, they're not in any hurry to get peers back into the office. That is what I'm saying. Cause 
we're, we're, we're billing a lot more. We're talking. Now on the flip side, me personally, I like talking to 
people in person a lot more. I don't feel like I can get as much emotion through the phone or even really 
Zoom, you know, I want to be in person. I want to feel how the, how the room is going, you know, like 
how sad are you really? How excited are you? Like you're missing out on a lot of stuff through the telecom. 
So I hope that it gets back to in person soon, but from, from a financial standpoint, peers are doing pretty 
well right now, overall. 
Ethan (01:26:27): 
And do you think clients are struggling more during this period? 
Bobby (01:26:33): 
Yeah, absolutely. As far as if you're just talking about substance abuse. Yeah, there, there has been a huge 
rise of relapses. You know, I, in my personal life, I was sponsoring I think seven people when it first started, 
and I'm down to one. So six of my sponsors have relapsed and, and that's, that's the same everywhere. 
Like my, my whole caseload basically fell off. I've had to rebuild another caseload. And it's, it's kinda like 
that across the board. It's, it's been a really rough time to try and get sober, you know. There's just not 
the support. The big things for me early on were all that support, the people coming over and giving me 
a pat on the back or shaking my hand and being like, Hey, man, it's good to see, you know. Going to 
meetings in person and feeling included. These, these people that are trying to get sober right now are 
not getting any of that. They're getting Zoom meetings where somebody didn't mute their mic. So there's 
like all this noise coming out, you know, and, and you're talking over everybody, like it's, it's just different 
right now. And, and I mean, people are still getting help and still. But it's just a really hard time. It's a really 
hard time to try and start this journey. 
Ethan (01:28:00): 
So like you say, the sooner we can get back to in-person the better. 
Bobby (01:28:03): 
Yeah, absolutely. That's what, yeah, the flip side of that is I'm looking forward to getting back in-person. 
Ethan (01:28:15): 
Well, I, I think we can, we can stop it there unless you have anything else to add. 
Bobby (01:28:21): 
No.
