Dear Mrs. Hawes,
 
I an
t writing to express my thanks for your taking the
 
time in a very creative life to teach all-too bland college
 
students the facts about Folklore and the for-real life in
 
general(ae opposed to the false status-seeking in the concert
 
hall audience).  During my stay at Valley State I benefited
 
f
rom the knowledge of you and Mr. Katz, and
. I cannot over-
emphasize the positive effect this had for me.  Aside from
 
knowing absolutely nothing about folklore generally, I also
 
made the customary mistake of trying to evaluate folk music
 
by opera-art song standards; I can thank you and Mr. Katz
 
for showing me what was really Involved in creative self-
expression and it certainly is not operatic vocal quality
 
(as listening to A.L. Lloyd, for one, has shown this to me)
 
and a"refinlng"of real-life in a process which does nothing
 
but drain experience of its reality and replame this essence
 
of existence with a stereotyped expressive formula.  The
 
contemporary world is generally overly preoccupied with
 
refining deceit and superficiality and I only am thankful
 
that at least two professors at Valley State are for real
 
and communicate to those who seek such reality--if' lor
 
no other reason, they seek people who are valid, for-real,
 
(or any term that one may care to choose) only to continue
 
in the hope that people like this do exist
 
Although as a teacher you have to contend with the
 
myriad of bureaucratic insults and petty intrusions which
 
form the foundation of the "academic establishment," I would
 
like to thank you for taking the time to be there and share
 
your wisdom with the few in each class who are there for
 
xiatentia] reasons and not for three-units of credit.
 
L
ach class will always have its status-seekers and general
 
deadwood," but the few in each class who really want a
 
meaningful experience will always be there; too often, they
 
will not know what they want or perhaps even why they are
 
in school at all, yet such people (myself included) know
 
that the answers exist somewhere that give the lie to the
 
deification of scientific empiricism (
at the expense of
 
nonverbal communion of experience and creativity generally/
 
In this country thanks to the superficial academic orientation)
 
for those who know that something is missing but they still
 
aren't aware of what this comprises.
 
My creative outlook has greatly enlarged due to my
 
consciously recreating what happened in your classes and
 
those of Mr. Katz (I also have written to his expressing
 
similar gratitude), life began to appear vital and valid,
 
and I cannot stress too much how enjoyable your class was
 
in a system characterized by bureaucratic individual nonenti-
ties.  I thank you for sharing your existence with myself and
 
the others who were privileged to be there...
 
SInc rely,

Dear Danita:
 
I am sorry to be answering your letter so tardily.  Thank you for
 
sending the names of your "informant8"I I have written them thanking
 
them for their cooperation, and I must thank you too for the care and
 
effort you put in to your excellent repvvt.
 
I
'm glad to be able to tell you also that my career at Northridge is not
 
in danger; I
'm afraid students will be stuck with me for some time to
 
come, though I may possible take a year's leave during 1975-76
 to work
 
on matters connected with the Bi-Centennial observances.  It seems to me
 
we do have a few things worth celebrating, expecially in the area of
 
folklife, and I would hate to see the year go by without having time to
 
get my own two cents in.
 
Thank you for your lovely letter.  I
'm afraid I may not be living up
 
to all your complimentary remarks this year, but I
'll keep trying to
 
do better.  And I hope all is going well for you now, and in the future.
 
Please don't hesitate to keep in touch; perhaps there'll be something
 
more I can do for you one of these days.
 
Cordially,
 
Bess Lomax Hawes

Dear Dr. L
ee,
 
A
s you may possibly have heard, I have departed from my
 usual
 
beaten path this year to teach f
olk l
ore a
nd f
olk music full time at San
 
Fernando Valley State.  This unlikely enterprise has involved me in c
ountless
 
areas which I find I know nothing whatever about
 
and I'm writing t
o a
sk y
our advise on one prtie lar problem.
 
I have a special Studies student, working f
or an MA in History
 
and Law who i
s i
nterested primarily in the area of s
outhern California history.
 
He has a
pparently d
one a good deal of work with l
ocal newspapers of early dates
 
and proposed to me a term project of g
oing through newspaper f
iles of the
 
1
850's and 60's and pulling out the t
opical poems which he says appear in
 
almost every i
ssue.  He i
s primarily interested in the reflections of the Civi'].
 
War
 teI
 (
this a
rea c
ontained a
 number of s
outherners a
pparently) but
 
suggested that, a
s long a
s he was doing the j
ob, he might a
s well exerpt all
 
the t
opical poetry of 4
pert d, in case o
ther researchers might be interested.
 
He proposes u
sing, a
s most available to
,hin locally,
 
the L
os Angeles Star 1
851-1879
 
the Los Angeles Semi-Weekly Southern News 1
860-1873 (
this Ipaper
 
apparently appeared under various names a
s well a
s the one given)
 
The Los Angeles Southern Californian 1
85b-5 and 1
861-3
 
The San Bernadino Guardian 1
851-1860
 
The Santa Marbara Gazette  1
855-1858
 
The Santa Barbara Morning Press 1
863--- (
still being published)
 
This s
ounds to me like a perfectly enormous j
ob, a
nd before he embarks
 
on i
t, I warit ñ t
o find out whether or not it had eIezzks
x
_
e f
r e  already been
 
d
one.  JxkKtRxkw I
 would certainly hate t
o d
iscover that a
ll this e
nergy has been
 
put to aproject gfzsgxexpxeJm&zxabm that i
s already reposing peacefully in the
 
State Historical Society f
iles, f
or example.  On c
onsulting D
.K. Wilgus, he agreed
 
with me that if anybody would know whether such a project has been c
ompleted or
 
not, you would be the one.  I
'd a
lso welcome any suggestions that might o
ccur t
o
 
you concerning the possible limits that kzx m we may find it necessary t
o impose.
 
The a
cademic year i
s yet young and energy i
s running high; a
s t
he year wears on,
 
he may find that he has to make an index of certain of the material, f
or e
xample,
 
or face the prospect of spending the next two y
ears at the j
ob.  If a
ny suggestions
 
a
s t
o what might most u
sefully be left out o
ccur t
o you off-hand, I
'd c
ertainly
 
a
ppreciate them,
 
at a
ll successfully,
 
Should this project turn out ta * rexaxpx Itl
i1  I will be delighted
 
to send the = a c
opy of it a
long t
o you,
 
if you think you might f
ind it u
seful.  It was s
o pleasant t
o s
ee you a
t the
 
Western F
olklore Meeting; I
 hope our paths will cross s
omeday a
gain soon.

ashewilcared,  The more I l

hat it is impossible and misleading to generalize.  All I can do is c

-o the p
eople at Murrin .
3ridge,, and to Chose who mma will read and use or
 
I was interested by your comments on decision making.  The
 
roblem here is deeper than that.  One of my main interests was t
o find out if
 
hhese p
eople were Aborigine at all, or if they were just deprived, isolated
 
:
eople.  Interestingly, all efforts to develop community and individual leader-
s
hip have f
ailed.  Initiative is frowned upon by the group.  Practical l
y all
 
d
ecisions of any oonsequenee are made by the white manager.  The Aborigines
 
will c
ome t
o him with personal problems large and small.  The comrcunity itself
 
is b
ound by s
trict c
odes of behavior that dictate action and reaction.  Fights
 
on t e
 reeh  h
f
low specific patterns, etc,
 
yhen speaking to me, individuals were hesitant to express
 
own opinions.  I was always asked "What did the others say?" and t
hen
 
would agree •  This is another reason why our findings may be inaccurate.

i h
ere a. o;:er wa

T
here is a group, elected h
i
j  t
he coninunit  that makes s
ome decisions.
 
But these p
eople are looked on a
s "crawlers" and "
traitors', as the manager
 
heads the cori n
ittee.
 
From what I understand  of t
heir tribal ssten, t
here was l
ittle
 
initiative.  They were bound by strict laws and codes.  If this has been
 
carried over or not is an interesting question.  I do know, however, that
 
there are o
ther s
ettlements where individual initiative does exist.  The
 
d
ifference is that there, there is no manager, no formal rules or r
egulations.
 
The p
eople at Murrin Bridge admire those living on these "independent" settle-
merits.  Yet they make no effort to join them.  They would tell me, "GO talk to
 
the p
eople a
t Walcania  they're not afraid."  It is an interesting question.
 
Unfortunately, I had neithwr the time nor training to find out the answers.
 
After writing the report, we may go to another s
ettle.-ant where a
 
cooperative has been e
stab±lished.  This fascinates ma, as it is a return to
 
tribJ. traditions.  When comparing our findings± there with those at Ywrin
 
Brid g
e, s
ome of these questions may be q
.nswered.
 
In the meantime, I met with disaster.  I was in a s&iiing accident •..
 
t ere's a ga 4ng hole in my leg, and I have to sit around while it h
eals,  When
 
they stare a

s

in English5 by the Aborigines.  Most involve drinking and
 
f
ighting, but are v
ery l

o

'm enclosing a t
iny s
hapshot taken while I was playing
 
out there (
tell Pte Seeger I
 e
' d better watch out) •  Having a banjo was t
he
 
greatest thing in t
he world.  1hat the picture doesn't show are four other
 
f
ollows, af
l wi t

 just sitting around exchanging tunes, I
 
was a

and it was f

might have t
