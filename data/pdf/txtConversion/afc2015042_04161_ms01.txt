Summary of  Interview / Event: 
Traditional cowboy Will Harris III describes the very dramatic changes he has undertaken to maintain and 
grow his family’s farm — making it one of the most bio-diverse and progressive operations in the United 
States. He discusses growing up as an only child on the farm, leaving to work for another company and 
returning to a changed consumer and ecological environment that he risked everything to embrace for the 
health of the land, the animals, the community, and his family. 
Interview Log: 
 …so I’ve had a rich culture, although not always good. I don’t think any culture is always all good. It’s a 
mixed bag. It’s created by imperfect people and is due to the economic decline of the agricultural sector and 
the vilification of much of the South—some of which needed vilifying although all didn’t. It’s also due to the 
brain drain of the A and B students going to the big cities and getting jobs and the C and D students staying 
the South. Southern culture was just eroding to the caricature of the trailer house, white trash, black trash, no 
culture, you know, disposable culture, and so I’m glad to see that turning a little bit.  
0 01 46 Will Harris III introduces himself. I was born in Blakely, Georgia on December 22, 1954, and I’m the 
owner of White Oak Pastures.  
0 02 32 I’ve been thinking about our conversation and how this is about a distinct workplace because it’s also 
a landscape and a hometown and a company town and it’s hard to know at what point to enter with you…I 
want the day-to-day of your work, but also on a meta level. You have crafted the occupational culture of 
White Oak Pastures so we’ll move between the work and the creating of the work. You describe layers of life 
on the farm — can you tell me a little bit about the first layer of your life when you started at White Oak 
Pastures and what’s an early memory for you?  
0 04 10 I was raised here on the farm. My father ran the farm, and I never ever wanted to do anything but run 
it. I never wanted to be a fireman or an astronaut. I wanted to run the farm. And I was raised playing like I 
ran the farm. That’s how I played. You know, here it’s not even fair to say the lines are blurred between work 
life, home life, and personal life. It’s not even blurred. It’s all the same.  
We work where we live. We work with the same people we live with. The vocation is the avocation and the 
hobby so it’s not even blurred. It’s just one on-going, daily, annual, generational cycle.  
0 05 24 We talked earlier, that I don’t believe that early hunter-gathers woke up and said, “I’ve gotta go to 
work.” They woke up and they hunted and gathered until they didn’t need to do it anymore, then they started 
back doing it. It isn’t like there were any lines between. I think that compartmentalization or segmentation of 
our lives is something that we have created as we evolved culturally. As we humans became more inquisitive 
and wanted more, we had to spend more time doing the things that brought monetary reward even to the 
point where we spend time doing things we don’t want to do…because we wanted a bigger house or a car or 
maybe back in the day a robe. So I think this compartmentalization into work and living is something we 
created kind of through greed.  
0 07 15 Will describes more of this continuum of his life. After high school graduation, he went to university 
as the first person in his family since the Civil War to go to college. His parents saw that as key to his 
advancement. He says that he wanted to go to college “because I was a kid and that extended my playtime, 
Occupational Folklore Project | Food Processing and Legacy Trades | White Oak Pastures: Will Harris, Owner
even though I knew I wanted to run the farm. Being able to leave home and go to university for four years 
was very attractive to me. I majored in animal science in the college of agriculture, because I knew I would 
come back and run the farm. I’d always been that C student and was perfectly happy with that.” 
Shortly before college graduation, Will and his dad discussed succession for the first time. Will says: He was 
an only child, and I was an only child, so there was no doubt as to what was going to happen. But the timing 
had never been discussed, and I was naive about it. When I graduated, my father was 50-something and very 
active, strong, and productive. In my immature mind I thought that I’d go home and he would sit on the 
porch. Yet he wasn’t ready to do that, and he was smart enough not to allow me to come back and work with 
him initially. We both had Western male alpha personalities. We could hunt, fish, and drink together, but we 
couldn’t work together. 
0 09 28 Although it broke his heart to get a job outside the farm, Will said that was the best thing that ever 
happened. He got an entry-level job at Gold Kist, then a regional, industrial agricultural cooperative, that isn’t 
in business anymore. The company had grain elevators, cotton gins, peanut buying points, fertilizer, and 
blending plants and pesticide application. It was an all-purpose agricultural cooperative. And it did some 
farmer lending. Will says that his plan to work there for a short time wound up lasting for a decade. 
0 10 26 Will adds that while he had always lived and worked on the farm, having a day job gave him his 
independence, which both he and his father needed. Working for Gold Kist, a Fortune 500 company, taught 
him so much that when he took over the farm, he was able to do things he couldn’t have done otherwise. Had 
he worked for his father right after college, the picture would be very different. 
0 11 05 What did being on his own allow him to do? Take risks? See business models? Will says that he was 
always a risk taker, so he didn’t learn that at Gold Kist. But he did learn to see things differently. He was 
forced to view different agricultural businesses and farms from a perspective different from owner-operator, 
which is what he would have done at White Oak Pastures. The experience was invaluable. 
Whereas my father would have had four employees, at Gold Kist, there were a lot. Early on, in my 20s and 
early 30s, I became a facility manager with 50 employees, and then a regional manager supervising 1,000. Just 
as good for me was gaining experience handling other people’s money and being able to make my mistakes 
working for the company and explaining to my boss rather than explaining it to the bank. That’s always better.  
0 12 30 At the 10-year mark, Will’s father began to show a dementia and he gradually started taking over the 
farm. For the next 10 years, he operated the farm the way that his father did. He says: Around the mid-‘80s, I 
came back to run the farm which was a typical industrial, monocultural cattle operation. My father probably 
had 800 to 900 mama cows, a lot for that time and place, and they used performance enhancing drugs, sub 
therapeutic antibiotics, and hormone implants and used a lot of pesticides and chemical fertilizer in the 
pastures. At the time, the farm probably had four minimum wage employees, and it was very much a part of 
the centralized, commoditized, industrialized, cattle-beef-production system. We were happy with that and 
successful. We had no debt. 
0 14 29 We were debt-free because my father, grandfather, and great grandfather had been good stewards of 
money. We had about 1,000 acres of land, a cattle herd, houses, and equipment that were all paid for, so our 
cattle business was a fairly low-return business. The assets were paid for, and we were good cattlemen. This 
won’t ;mean much to you, but we typically got a 92 percent calf crop. This means that for every 1,000 cows 
that you expose to the bull, you would ween 920 calves. That’s very high. In this country, the average is 70-
something. We were good at it. 
As a result our business was not high-return but it was profitable—not obscenely profitable—and we made 
money every year. I mean, I didn’t know that you could lose money in the cattle business. I only found out 
later when I started changing, that you could lose money. But at the time, we paid taxes every year, and it was 
stable, a pretty resilient business. I’m not sure if that was right, but at th time I thought it was. 
Occupational Folklore Project | Food Processing and Legacy Trades | White Oak Pastures: Will Harris, Owner
0 15 54 Parenthetically, there are other cattle operations in Georgia, but ours was unique because we’re in the 
heart of row-cropping country. Peanuts, cotton, and corn make up the southern trifecta that’s rotated on 
farm lands around here, and we were pretty much exclusively cattle people. That is a bit odd but it probably 
has to do more with traditions that anything else. Like today, I love the cattle business, and cattle are my 
favorite single species. My father and grandfather and on back loved them, too. 
0 16 57 So when I return and took over operations from my father, there were about four people working 
here who would then work for me. It’s probably not fair to say that I cared for my father, for my mother was 
still living and my wife did a lot. I ran the farm, so I don’t want to take credit for being a caregiver when I 
didn’t much care. I was running the business. 
0 17 44 When the cows came to term, we raised the calves and marketed the cattle in several different ways, 
doing everything from selling semi-truckloads of live calves to be shipped to Nebraska or wherever to 
actually retaining ownership of the cattle on a distant western feed yard. WE actually ran a feedlot her on the 
farm, where we fed corn to the cattle and occasionally sold some beef to consumers. We told some to the 
abattoir, the slaughterhouse, for we didn’t own one then. We were pretty much an industrial cattle operation. 
0 18 55 After doing that for about a dozen years, Will transitions to what the operation is now. I get that 
question a lot, and I wish I had a good story-that I saw lightening and a burning bush and that God spoke to 
me, but really, that’s not what happened. What happened is that however much I loved the our cattle business, 
I became increasingly aware of the unintended consequences of using industrial farming methods. All the 
industrial farming methods that we used—performance enhancing drugs, pesticides, fertilizers, confinement 
feeding, and all those innovations—were brought to us by reductionist science to take the cost out of cattle 
production and make it cheaper.  
0 20 07 And that was very effective. All those things took great cost out of production: labor costs, land 
costs, total production costs. When you divide how much you spent into how many pounds of beef you 
produced, it was a low number. I’d get excited about the new drug coming out next year…to grow cattle 
faster and better I really liked that. But those innovations,while very effective in making food production 
cheaper, brought with them unintended and unnoticed consequences, which fell on the backs of the animals 
and the land and community. 
0 21 22 So what happened to my land and the cattle, you ask? I noticed that because it was so extreme. 
I admit that, if the label said we could use a pint, I might have used a quart and, if a label said you could give 
them two cc’s every month, I might have given them three cc’s every two weeks, so the unintended 
consequences were more obvious to me. That caused me to not want to do that anymore and to move away 
from using those things. 
0 22 08 As to what happened to Bluffton, there’s a parallel story. Along with the industrialization of 
agriculture came its centralization. With that came the further processing additions at central locations where 
production could be more efficient than it was in little towns like Bluffton, which weren’t needed anymore.  
There was a time when a little town like Bluffton would have had its own little slaughterhouse, its own little 
corn grist mill, its own little flour grist mill, and its own vegetable washing shed and packaging plant, so that 
all the value additions would have been accomplished right here locally, making jobs for people. Farming took 
a lot of people. To go way back, it was 40 acres and a mule, so there was a family every 40 acres, and 1,000 
acres would have had 25 families on it. Today, two guys can farm 3,000 acres That’s mechanization, 
So with all these consolidations, centralization, and industrialization, towns weren’t needed. And the only 
reason there’s evidence of a town here is that there are still some houses in it, so poorer people stayed there, 
using up their equity. They didn’t have a place to make a good living or, if they did, they moved out, and 
Occupational Folklore Project | Food Processing and Legacy Trades | White Oak Pastures: Will Harris, Owner
someone much poorer than they moved in. So as soon as all the equity was used up in the stores and the 
houses, they closed up and left. Today the farm uses a different kind of agriculture that creates a lot more 
jobs, and we’re involved in the town. 
0 24 35 On our 2,500 acres of land, we’ve got 137 people working, and they’re not minimum wage people. 
They make pretty good salaries for this time and place. The town is needed. We need houses for these people 
to live in so they don't have to drive 20 miles to work. And our employees need a place to shop and buy 
gasoline, and they need a restaurant.  
You know, the fact that little towns sink into oblivion is not a rare story or a Southern story. It’s going on all 
over the rural areas of this nation. Some of those towns have been lifted back up by gentrification or agri-
tourism or tourism of some sort, but Bluffton is being lifted back up by agriculture, and we think that’s pretty 
cool. Not many towns that were born in agricultural endeavors have been resurrected by agriculture. That’s 
not very common. 
0 26 18 Having noticed the unintended consequences of industrialized, centralized, commoditized farming, I 
wanted to do things differently. I never really intended to change nearly as much as we did. We started by 
taking baby steps, and one thing led to the next, to the next, to the next.  
The first thing I did was give up giving my cattle performance enhancing drugs and feed grain...I farmed like 
that for a year or two, maybe more, and then also decided to quit using chemical fertilizer and pesticides. That 
was a much harder change financially. I started looking for ways to capture some of the quality I was putting 
in to get more money per pound because I had less pounds…and I found a little traction there…And then I 
started having some production problems because I still had a monoculture of just cattle and nature abhors a 
monoculture…  
0 29 25 Nature will not allow a monoculture to exist….Nature requires a smorgasbord of many different 
microbes and plants and animals living in symbiotic relationships with each other. That’s the way the earth 
evolved, was created….and we invented monocultural production. We embraced that factory model.  
In my case what happened was I had some weeds show up because I wasn’t using herbicides. And, the grass 
was not growing well because I wasn’t using fertilizer and I didn’t have a thriving microbial biome, so we 
brought sheep in. That was the first falling out with my father, he called them pasture maggots, but they did a 
great job… Later one we brought poultry because they helped the soil, the land and then hogs — hogs and 
goats are forest creatures….we’re rebuilding a polyculture that maximizes symbiosis… 
0 27 50 The overriding reason for changes in agricultural production shouldn’t just be taste, it’s more than 
that… 
0 32 22 On how Will learned about polyculture, regenerative agriculture, humane animal farming and 
business…through recollections of things he observed as a child…things his father recalled…talking to old 
people was invaluable to me…old employees…We used to keep the hogs in the woods? Why did we do 
that?…and I just figured it out.  
0 34 09 On growing the business from four employees at minimum wage to 137 employees that make about 
what the county average salary is. I’m very proud of that. We went from a million dollars, or less, in sales to 
$20-something million in sales and that growth all came very quickly, in a ten- or fifteen-year period. The 
growth just about killed us because we couldn’t keep up with it. We couldn’t change things rapidly enough…
but we hired really good, smart people that brought some order to the chaos… 
Will describes the five directors that run the company: me and two family members—one daughter and one 
son-in-law and two non-family directors. My daughter Jenni is Director of Marketing. She handles sales, 
marketing inventory, distribution, deals with customers, both wholeseale and retail, runs our website and 
online store and those kinds of things. My son-in-law John Benoit manages the flocks and herds. 
Occupational Folklore Project | Food Processing and Legacy Trades | White Oak Pastures: Will Harris, Owner
Jean Turn is our Comptroller and she handles all things administrative…she has a very structured approach…
The other non-family Director is Brian Sapp. He is a scientist. He’s got a master’s degree in Meat Science and 
he would’ve had a string of PhDs if we hadn’t snatched him up and brought him to Bluffton. 
And I’m in charge of the farm itself. Everybody else works for us. It’s very effective and we’ve all just got 
such different personalities.  
0 38 34 You know, I’m a cowboy and my default answer is HELL YEAH! I see all the reasons why anything I 
want to do will work. Brian is a scientist and his default answer is NO NO NO NO, WE CAN’T DO THAT. 
and he sees all the reasons why anything I want to do won’t work. Jean is the business woman, the financial 
manager and she's the one who brings us to reality in terms of, ‘How much is this going to cost? We don’t 
have enough money to do that. When is it going to start paying back what we invested in it?’ Jenni is the 
marketing person and she says, ‘I don’t even know where to go with it….You can produce it but I don’t have 
a customer for that.’ And John is the guy that does the heavy lifting and makes it work. He is the 
implementor. He keeps the animals fed, nourished, happy, breeding, producing, growing. And it works really 
well for us.  
0 40 10 On the farm never having lost money then five-six years of loosing money from changing to 
sustainable production…to never being fifteen minutes late paying anybody and never having owed anybody 
anything to having borrowed $7.5M to build our processing processing plants…  
0 41 20 On the decision to build an on-farm, USDA-inspected processing facility…at the time, we were the 
only farm in the country with its own processing facility….and we were operating it at a loss…We went from 
no debt and making money to a bunch of debt and loosing money…But due to luck, divine intervention, or 
whatever it was, we caught traction with our sales…and suddenly, one Friday, we had a little money in the 
bank. We didn’t have money in the bank for six or seven years. And since that Friday, every Friday, we’ve had 
a little more money in the bank…and we’ve paid down a lot of debt… 
Will discusses ancillary businesses they’ve since acquired…’that support the living organism called White Oak 
Pastures…. 
0 43 05 On crafting the team of directors…I can’t say I trained them, we all learned together and that gets 
back to our basic hiring practices…We don’t do it like corporate America…and because we’ve been growing 
so fast, we hire just about anyone that walks up and asks for a job if they make us believe they’ve got a good 
work ethic and they’re honest. We’ll find something for them to do if they then show that they’re smart. And 
my definition of smart is that they make good decisions. I don’t care if you can’t conjugate a verb, just make 
good decisions, then we’ll promote you… 
0 44 56 There are three ‘classes’ of employees here. At the bottom are just very casual employees. They are 
here just for the money and that’s okay. We’ve got to have stuff done and they’re willing to do it. And within 
that group, there’s a fairly high turn over…guys that feed chickens, water the hogs, wash out the packing 
plant…the entry-level, basic work in the garden…very basic kinds of simple skills that any honest person 
that’s willing to do the task that they’re assigned can do. In my mind, it’s an arms length business transaction. 
You need some money, I need that done. We get along forever.  
The opposite end of that are the people that are passionate about being here.  
They’re like me. It’s their life. They live it. There’s very little node of differentiation between work-time, 
leisure-time, family-time. It’s all one. And those people just don’t turn over. They stay. 
0 47 07 The other group that I love is young, passionate, highly educated people and not from a farm 
background, for the most part. They’re here for the experience and when they come here they know and I 
know they’re not going to stay very long. They come here the same way you’d go to Harvard University. It’s a 
four-year gig: Freshman, sophomore junior, senior and you’re out of here. And that’s fine with me. I was 
Occupational Folklore Project | Food Processing and Legacy Trades | White Oak Pastures: Will Harris, Owner
raised in a culture that wanted people to stay for thirty years and go on a pension and I don’t feel that way. If 
we hire these passionate, young, motivated people and they come here with a bunch of new ideas and a lot of 
energy and pour it into White Oak Pastures and, in turn, get a world-class education on regenerative 
agriculture that you can’t get anywhere else? That’s a fair deal. The fact that someone is not going to stay here 
very long is not a reason not to hire them.  
0 48 46 About a day sunrise to sunset. I’ve got a really good job. I don’t do anything I don’t want to. I do a lot 
stuff…generally i get up really early depending on what time of year it is. Summer is early, fall is later. I get 
out and I make my rounds. One of the things I do miss is that I don’t do too much physical work anymore. It 
made me feel better. But today I really don’t have time for that. I’ve got to make my rounds…I do a lot of 
texting. I see things that need doing…so I’ll text the other managers and directors on what I think we ought 
to do… 
I don’t run this farm by myself. I make suggestions to them and many times they were going to do it anyway. 
Many times they’ll say, ‘yeah but I’ve also go to do so-and-so.’ And it’s all fine. I’m the guy that’s been here the 
longest and in many cases I see things they might not have seen, so I look and make suggestions. Where are 
the rounds? What does that mean, ‘doing the rounds’?  
The farm is little over 2,500 contiguous acres and it’s longer than it is wide. It’s almost five miles long, but less 
than a mile wide and in some places its only a few hundred yards wide. It lies along Highway 27 and 
surrounds the little town of Bluffton.  
So rounds, for me, means—go where the livestock is.  
We rotate animals through the pasture so they’re not always in the same place. I’ll go where the cows are. I’ll 
go where the sheep are. I’ll go where the goats are. I’ll go where the pigs are. I’ll go where the poultry are. I 
may go by the vegetable garden…I probably won’t stop because I can’t help them much, because i don’t 
know much about vegetables…  
Then I may stop by the store. Then stop by the church where the administrative offices are. Stop by the Raw 
Hide building, which is for our value-added products. Stop by the poultry plant. There are a number of places 
on any given day where there’s activity. I mean, there’s a hundred and thirty-seven people working somewhere. 
So i go where they’re working.  
0 51 30 I’ll finish that by mid-morning 10 or something and I’ll go back to my office, which is in the old 
courthouse and I check email. Some of that is a little bit drudgery work for me but there isn’t that much of it 
and most of the stuff I don’t want to do can fall to somebody. I go through my emails, I go eat lunch at the 
Pavilion—we have a pavilion on the farm where we cook lunch seven days a week for our employees and 
others that are passing through…Employees and their families eat and drink for half price and it’s really good 
food…it’s a real collegiate kind of atmosphere with everyone sitting down and eating together at picnic 
tables…it might be that five butchers sit together but someone from the office or the garden or the livestock 
farm sits down with the five butchers because that’s where you can sit. Then I go back and check email. 
maybe there’s a meeting. I set meetings up right after lunch with visitors. We have a lot of visitors. Very 
seldom does a day go by when someone isn’t here visiting. I don’t just mean a casual visitor, I mean someone 
like you here for a prescribed purpose or maybe a food service distributor or a grocery distributor. We’ve 
gotten a lot of good press and publicity and often there’s someone here writing or doing a blog… 
I don’t have any of the old employees who are just cowboying anymore.  
I guess Brian Sapp is the longest standing employee here and he came in 2008. So he’s been here for nine 
years and I’ve been here for 62 years. So I have some information that others don’t have because I’ve been 
here. Then I get back out in the afternoon and make my rounds again. Pretty much the same thing — see 
what got done, see what we still need to do….maybe make some suggestions to some managers about 
directions we might-ought to go in. Sometimes their ideas and mind are not the same and when that happens 
Occupational Folklore Project | Food Processing and Legacy Trades | White Oak Pastures: Will Harris, Owner
if theirs seems like it’s perfectly reasonable then that’s the one we’ll go with. I’d rather a manager implement 
their plan that’s 80% then implement mine that’s 100%….because if its their plan, they’ll make it work, even 
if its an eighty… 
I mentioned the fact that we get along…I’m very proud of that and what I’ll say of that is that it’s our culture 
to be nice to each other.  
I believe every business has a culture. Every institution has a culture, whether its Ford Motor Company or a 
plumber with one helper putting in a pipe, there’s a culture. And our culture is, ‘we’re going to be nice to each 
other. And, if you can’t be nice, you’ve got to go.’  
Was that way with your father?  
No, it’s part of the kinder, gentler agriculture….you can’t do this without good people and the best way to 
have good people is to have happy people… 
0 58 15  I say, ‘we spend a lot of time together. We’re going to be nice to each other. God Dammit! We’re 
going to be nice to each other. If you can’t be nice, get yo’ ass out! Be nice to each other. And not just to me 
because I own the farm, be nice to each other… 
0 59 16 END
