Notes from talk with Frankie,  Doug,  Joangela
 
Frankie's maiden name is Sullivan;  she was born in Brunswick but did
 
most of her growing up on St Simon's.  Her first husband was Joseph Jones
 
(Bessie's second son);  after bearing several children  (Bessie's
 
grandchildren),  Frankie and Joseph divorced and Frankie married Douglas
 
Quimby who is from Baconton,  (
sp.?)  Georgia where Bessie came from.  She
 
and Doug themselves have a number of children who are not,  therefore,
 
Bessie's grandchildren.
 
Bessie had three children:
 
George Jones  (minister;  alive and living on St Simons);
 
injured a few years back in a major car accident,  since that time has
 
become increasingly miserly and excessively religious;  Worth Long
 
concurred in a separate conversation that George was a bit on the
 
tetched side and certainly extremely obsessive about religion.
 
Joseph Jones  (alive,  living on St Simons) .
 Originally
 
married to Frankie and father of several children including Joangela
 
Jones Stephens  (
251 Cornwall Street,  Brunswick,  Ga
 31520;'  912-265-
1253) .
 She is the oldest grandchild and very active in helping her
 
mother.
 
Rosalee Jones Wrice  (
sp.?)  (deceased) .She left a daughter
 
Johnnie Mae Brooks.
 
A group of Bessie's grandchildren including Joangela  (
and Johnnie Mae ?
)
 
toured with Bessie at one time and remember visiting Alan in New York
 
with their grandma.
 
Joangela reported during the conversation that most of the family think
 
that Frankie and Doug are getting all the royalty money;  actually,  of
 
course,  they have been getting none of it except for my personal
 
donation to the festival.)

A couple of years ago Evelyn Sasko, our Copyright Manager, called you about
 
money we are holding for the Estate of Bessie Jones, and you suggested she
 
write Frankie Quimby which she did and never had a reply although she
 
followed up with another letter.
 
Today somebody from Alan Lomax's office called and they've been getting money
 
too.
 It seems such a shame because there must be a next of kin who could use
 
the money if she didn't have a will.
 Of course there's nothing we can do if
 
nobody provides us with the proper papers.
 
Do you know of any relative of hers in the Georgia Sea Islands or anybody who
 
would care enough to impress upon the family that there is money being held
 
for them?
 
I
've been reading Alan's wonderful book "The Land Where the Blues Began".
 The
 
style is so readable and I
'm learning something besides!
 
All best wishes,
 
Judy Bell

I am writing this letter in regards to the book Step It Down. On
 
August 11, 1993 Stanton's Sheet Music will be conducting an  Elementary/
 
General Music clinic.  We have chosen Step It Down as one of the items
 
to be promoted.  Our clinician, Emily Crocker, has decided to use "Head
 
and Shoulders" to demonstrate the collection.
 
I contacted The University of Georgia Press for permission to copy.
 
They, h
twever, do not control the rights, but told me that Ludlow Music
 
does.  They were unable to give me any further information and I am
 
unable to find any information about this company.  If you have any
 
information about Ludlow Music it would be a tremendous help to us.
 
Please call, fax, or write me at Stanton's at your earliest convenience
 
so that we may be able to promote this wonderful collection to it's
 
fullest.

Dear Ms. Orchard:
 
A
 Federal agency advised by t
he
 
National Council o
n t
he Arts
 
Herewith at long las t the contract for reprint1n
s ep It Down together with a
 
proposed introduction to the re-issuj,: If you feel t
 rneed5'
 editing,
 
I am used to being edited and don't take offense (
though I may bleed '
a little
 
quietly).  '
 '
 
I am still looking for Pictures
PO some good ones will eventually
 reach
 
you.  Mrs . Jones
 wasn't
 very
 photogenic somehow, a quality she shared with me,
 
but I will keep looking for some that look vaguely like her.
 
I am going on the assumption that the matter of increasing royalties`
sWill be
 
written into the contract as we discussed it over the phone, also that my
 
request that Douglass and Frankie Quimby receive copies at cost will be honored.
 
You will probably also be relieved to learn that all royalties should be sent
 
to me.  I will donate them in Beasie's na m
e to appropriate causes, such as the
 
ongoing Georgia Sea Island Festival and the Zora Neale Hurston Memorial Fund.
 
Best wishes, and please let me know how matters evolve and what the potential
 
publication deadline may turn out to be.

Except in cases hereinafter provided,  the Publisher shall pay,
 
on all copies sold at full price less an allowable discount, royalty
 
of 10 percent on the clothbound copies and 7 percent on the paper-

three (3) months after the date of the statement. No royalty shall be
 
paid on any copies sold at or below manufacturing cost. Payments
 
amounting to less that $15.00 are normally held until royalties in
 
excess of this amount are accumulated.  Should the Author receive an
 
overpayment of royalty arising from copies reported sold but subse-
quently returned,  the Publisher may deduct such overpayment from any
 
other sums due the Author,  i
t being understood, however,  that the
 
t
erm "overpayment" does not apply to an unearned advance specifically
 
agreed to as applying to one book.

copies of the Publisher's cloth edition and 10 complimentary copies
