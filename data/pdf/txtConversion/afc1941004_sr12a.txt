John Henry Faulk: Well, Mrs. Curry, did you hear what happened Sunday?
Mrs. E. N. Curry: Yes.
John Henry Faulk: What do you think about that Japanese-American war?
Mrs. E. N. Curry: Well, I think it's awfully bad.
John Henry Faulk: Well, for what reason?
Mrs. E. N. Curry: But, I feel like we will win the war.
John Henry Faulk: Good. Why do you feel like we'll win?
Mrs. E. N. Curry: Well, we've got lots of help.
John Henry Faulk: Well, from whom for instance?
Mrs. E. N. Curry: Well, just different ones.
John Henry Faulk: What about Japan and Italy, they have a lot of help.
Mrs. E. N. Curry: That's right too, but I feel like we'll win the war.
John Henry Faulk: Well, what do you think about Japan?
Mrs. E. N. Curry: Well, I think if Japan had to stayed out, we wouldn't have ever gone into war.
John Henry Faulk: Why Mrs. Curry?
Mrs. E. N. Curry: Well, I don't know hardly.
John Henry Faulk: Do you think Japan attacked us, I mean do you think that attack was in any way
justified?
Mrs. E. N. Curry: Well, I can't say, I just don't know.

John Henry Faulk: What did you think about it when you first heard about it? What was your first
reactions to war?
Mrs. E. N. Curry: [long pause] Well, I just don't know.
John Henry Faulk: Pretty exciting.
Mrs. E. N. Curry: Yes, it was. Very exciting.
John Henry Faulk: Will any of your boys — will Russell have to go?
Mrs. E. N. Curry: I don't know.
John Henry Faulk: How old is he?
Mrs. E. N. Curry: Eighteen. He's thinking about joining now before they conscript him.
John Henry Faulk: Well, would you be willing for your son to go fight the Japanese?
Mrs. E. N. Curry: Why yes, he's no better than [anybody else (?)]
John Henry Faulk: ???
Mrs. E. N. Curry: Yeah.
John Henry Faulk: What do you think about war Mrs. Curry? Especially with Japan?
Mrs. E. N. Curry: Well, I think war is horrible with anybody any time. Now, that's just exactly what I
think about war. I've been hearing of war all my life. My daddy was an old Rebel soldier and I mean
they went through plenty of hardships, a lot more so than they will have to do now.
John Henry Faulk: You think so? What kind of war do you think this will be?
Mrs. E. N. Curry: Well, I believe this is going to be a pretty long war and bad. Just exactly what I
believe about it from what I've heard.
John Henry Faulk: Mm, hmm. Mm, hmm [affirmative]. Well, what do you think will happen to Japan?
Mrs. E. N. Curry: Well, I just don't know. I hope she gets whipped.

John Henry Faulk: I know, but after she's whipped what should happen to them?
Mrs. E. N. Curry: Well, I just don't know Johnny.
John Henry Faulk: What I meant by that was how did you feel toward her?
Mrs. E. N. Curry: Well, I haven't gotten any love or respect for her.
John Henry Faulk: [laughs] Well, I don't blame you a bit after what they did. Do you think
Roosevelt was, his action was right?
Mrs. E. N. Curry: Yes I do, really.
John Henry Faulk: In other words, you're behind him?
Mrs. E. N. Curry: I'm behind him a hundred percent.
John Henry Faulk: Good. Well what do you think about our chances of winning it? From what you
know about it.
Mrs. E. N. Curry: Well, I believe they're good. Really, I believe they're good.
John Henry Faulk: [long pause] Do you think Germany had a hand in —
Mrs. E. N. Curry: Sure. Yes.
John Henry Faulk: They do, huh?
Mrs. E. N. Curry: Yeah.
John Henry Faulk: Germany, then is the real one we're going to have to beat.
Mrs. E. N. Curry: Sure. Germany and Italy too. They're expecting them to, any minute, to declare war
against us.
John Henry Faulk: Is that right?
Mrs. E. N. Curry: That's right. Turn the radio on.
"Man-on-the-Street", Austin, Texas, December 9, 1941 http://www.loc.gov/item/afc1941004_sr12
John Henry Faulk: Do you listen to your radio?
Mrs. E. N. Curry: I mean [both laugh]. Yes, we're expecting them any minute.
John Henry Faulk: Well, that's going to make a world war, Miss Curry.
Mrs. E. N. Curry: World war, yes it's going to make a world war.
John Henry Faulk: Do you realize how serious that is?
Mrs. E. N. Curry: I'm telling you it is serious.
John Henry Faulk: There's going to be a whole lot of bloodshed and property loss for us. Do you think
this war will be as bad as the last war?
Mrs. E. N. Curry: Oh yes. Worse. Really.
John Henry Faulk: You think Japan's going to give us a real fight then.
Mrs. E. N. Curry: Yeah.
John Henry Faulk: I heard they're not so well-equipped that they —
Mrs. E. N. Curry: Now, they think that Japan will offer Russia a peace [someone in background says
something unintelligible]. Yeah, and let them get all their equipment.
John Henry Faulk: What do you think about that? Reckon they will?
Mrs. E. N. Curry: Well, I hope not. I don't know.
John Henry Faulk: I don't believe Russia would respond. [someone in background says something
unintelligible]
Mrs. E. N. Curry: I don't much believe it, myself. I hope not.
John Henry Faulk: Russia never has lost any love for Japan. I don't believe they'll do a thing for
Japan.
Mrs. E. N. Curry: Well, I hope not.

John Henry Faulk: Would you be willing for your son to go across the ocean and fight?
Mrs. E. N. Curry: Why, might as well to be. If they want him, they'll take him anyway so I might as well
just be willing to it. Of course, they ain't nobody willing, but . . .
John Henry Faulk: Well, I know if anybody will want to see it, of course.
Mrs. E. N. Curry: No.
John Henry Faulk: If the time's got to come it's got to come.
Mrs. E. N. Curry: Yeah.
John Henry Faulk: Whether you object. Well, where do you think we're the strongest or do you got
any idea what part of our army is the strongest? The air, or the sea, or land-fighting or how?
Mrs. E. N. Curry: Well, on the sea I believe. I don't —
John Henry Faulk: That would be our strong, better course against Japan, that's what we're going to
have to have. [train whistle in background]
Well, I sure thank you Miss Curry for your ideas on this war. I guess they're pretty gloomy aren't
they?
Mrs. E. N. Curry: They sure are. Well, you're just more than welcome Johnny.
