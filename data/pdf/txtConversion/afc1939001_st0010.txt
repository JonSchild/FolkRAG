WORRY BLUES
Some people say that the worry blues ain't bad, Some people say that the worry blues ain't
bad; But it's the worst old feelin' that I most ever had.
Everything that I do seem like I do it wrong, (2) Sometimes I regret that I was ever born.
Blues and trouble seem to be my best friend, (2) Even when my blues leave me, then my
troubles begin.
If any one asks you who composed this song, (2) Tell him you don't know who wrote it, but
he's done come and gone.
Sung by Jesse Lockett (Negro convict) Clemens state farm, Brazoria, Texas, April 16,
1939.
