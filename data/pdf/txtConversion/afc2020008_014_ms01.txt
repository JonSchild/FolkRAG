Mike Sterner interviewed by Vyta Pivo on May 26, 2021 at the Lehigh Cement Company Plant 
in Evansville, Pennsylvania. The interview transcript has been edited for clarity.  
 
[00:00:00] 
 
Vyta Pivo: 
Today is Wednesday, May 26, 2021. This is an interview for the occupational 
history archive, which is part of the Folklife Center at the Library of Congress, funded by the 
Archie Green Fellowship. As part of this project, I am interviewing cement workers in the 
Lehigh Valley of Pennsylvania, the birthplace of the modern cement industry in the United 
States. The recording and transcript will become part of the permanent collection at the Library 
of Congress. I am Vyta Pivo and today I'm speaking with Mike Sterner here at the Lehigh 
Cement Company Plant in Evansville, Pennsylvania. And just to confirm, you, give me your 
permission to record the interview, is that correct?  
 
Mike Sterner:  
Yes, that's correct.  
 
VP: 
Thank you so much. Could you tell me your full name, year of birth, and where you 
were born?  
 
MS: 
My full name is Michael Shannon Sterner. I was born 1969. I was born actually in 
Allentown, Pennsylvania.  
 
VP: 
And that's just an hour or so?  
 
MS: 
Yeah.  
 
VP: 
Is that where you grew up?  
 
MS: 
No, I grew up in a little town called Boyer's Junction, which is maybe 10 minutes from 
here.  
 
VP: 
When did you first learn about the cement industry or the material?  
 
[00:01:14] 
 
MS: 
Actually, when I was a kid, I used to help my uncle and other family members do 
projects around the house, building garages, and then they laid the foundations and pour 
cement. And that's when I started helping and I learned from that. And then I realized that one 
of my friends actually worked here. And so, I learned about the industry a little bit. And then I 
got a job here about 21years ago.  
 
VP: 
And what year was that?  
 
MS: 
2000.  
 
VP: 
What did you like about working with cement, or with concrete, I guess?  
 
2 
 
MS: 
Uh, it's hard to pinpoint. I mean, I like, when I got hired here, I became an electrician 
soon afterwards, I really love that job. But it's neat how we can take raw materials from the 
earth and transform them through heat and all the different chemistry to make different types 
of cement for different purposes. To me, that always fascinated me that we could pretty much 
take dirt and turn it into a product that we use.  
 
VP: 
So, what types of jobs have you held at the plant?  
 
MS: 
I was laborer when I first started here and then I got a job as a fill-in for a shift repairman 
and an electrician. And then it became a, they split the jobs and became just a shift electrician. 
And then I got on the day shift watcher gang. So, now I'm a certified electrician, [unclear] 
journeyman electrician. I went to school for it, they actually sent me, which was really nice. 
 
VP: 
How long did the schooling take you? 
 
MS: 
Four years. It was a night class.  
 
VP: 
And is that because you started training here with electrical work?  
 
MS: 
Yeah, I was doing electrical work here maybe eight years before I went to school, which 
helped me learn more about choosing different components from work and make sure that it 
actually works in the long run instead of just patching it together and, which is what we did on 
shift just to get it running so that dayshift could fix it better. But so, I got to learn a lot more 
about electric and all the components of that industry.  
 
VP: 
Is that a salary position?  
 
MS: 
No, that's it's a, it's an hourly job.  
 
VP: 
And so, what would you say are some of the more challenging responsibilities you have 
in the plans?  
 
[00:03:36] 
 
MS: 
One of the challenging stuff has been like when we do a new installation with a new 
project because our bosses will give us a project and hey, you need to do all this, but then you 
don't see how it's going to fit later on here. It, it's kind of challenging to configure what you're 
working on to what it's supposed to be without really seeing it in the future yet. That's kind of 
challenging. And then we do, not all the time, but we do have high voltage stuff here. We do 
work on some of that sometimes, which is challenging because, well, I'm not used to working 
with over 13,000 volts. So, it's challenging, but we're safe. I mean, I'm not scared of it, but it's 
a little challenging working on something that you don't normally work on.  
 
VP: 
Are there particular machines that are more intimidating to work?  
 
MS: 
Oh, usually in this industry, everything's a little intimidating at first, when you first get 
hired or you're walking through on a tour because it's all big and it's loud and it crushes stuff. 
And the other potential, I mean, we have a lot of guarding. But years ago when I first started 
here, we didn't have that kind of guarding. And it's very easy to get hurt if, when you first 
3 
 
started here, because there's a lot of big rotating equipment and it doesn't stop, so. And when 
you do hit the emergency stop, it takes a while to shut off.  
 
VP: 
Do you work as part of a team?  
 
MS: 
Yeah.  
 
VP: 
How many people on the team? 
 
MS: 
In our department we have eight electricians, we have three supervisors. But we also 
do emissions monitoring also as part of the electrical group. So, we have electrical foreman 
and then the boss that you would consider actually part of the [unclear] with the constant 
emissions monitoring and then a supervisor of everything. So, there's technically eleven of us 
and we all work as a team, salary and hourly.  
 
VP: 
And so, what is the training like?  
 
[00:05:47] 
 
MS: 
First, it's mostly about safety. It's excessively about safety because there were incidents 
here years ago before I even got hired that one of our electrical engineers was involved in, 
could have been potentially fatal or serious injuries. But ever since he, well even before him, 
but that really ingrained in him that he needed to instill safety in all of his electricians, which, 
like I said, for training, it really starts out of safety. All the equipment, they make sure we have 
everything we need, all our tools are fixed. If something's not quite right to work in electrical 
cabinet, that will buy us a replacement and then it just proceeds from there, like how to use 
your meter. And then I, I'm sorry turn my radio off, and then how to the different voltage 
systems here at the plant, how to operate them, how the controls and all that stuff. You just 
basically work your way into it. They never put you alone, you're always with somebody, so 
then the person you're with has more knowledge on it. So, they watch what you're doing all the 
time. They'll take you by the hand and pretty much show you everything. And then you learn 
by working, like I said before, the safety part as far as all our machinery here that comes in 
when you're laborer because you've got to know what you're doing around them.  
 
VP: 
Could you describe a typical day at work for you? When does it start, what do you do?  
 
MS: 
A typical day starts at seven o'clock, we have a safety meeting at our shop, and the 
subjects change every day. And then we're given our job assignments. We'll get all the tools 
together for that job and we'll discuss with the foreman if we have any questions about what 
we're doing or if there's any hazards associated with it. And then we'll go to our job site, do an 
inspection of the area, make sure there's no hazards present before we actually start working, 
like trip hazards, yeah, and anything like that. And then we'll start doing our job. And it's pretty 
much full, complete our job, we're not, there's nobody behind us rushing us. It's do it right, do 
it safe. I mean, unless it's something that's down and it's very important and it's hey, speed up 
a little bit, but we still have to do it safe first. But we just do that and we take breaks for water. 
We'll get our lunch at 11:30 to twelve and then we just finish out the day and put our tools 
away before three and then three o'clock we're getting a shower, going home.  
 
VP: 
What types of tools do you work with?  
 
4 
 
MS: 
Oh, most of my stuff is [unclear] specialty screwdrivers that are rated for up to a 1,000 
volts. And if I don't have the actual electrically insulated ones, it's just wrapped with electrical 
tape. And the stuff we use isn't the cheap stuff either. It's one wrap is equal to 500 volts. So, 
you, so we wrap everything up really good heads, mostly all hand tools. We use a lot of 
instrumentation, stuff like our multimeter to check for voltage and continuity. And we have 
other things like one piece of equipment we have called a megger, which actually puts voltage 
into a motor to check it, to see if it's short at the ground or shorted face-to-face, so we can 
determine if there's a motor issue here or if a cable's bad or just troubleshooting tools like that.  
 
VP: 
And so, so much of your work is outside out in the elements right around the machines.  
 
MS: 
Yeah, pretty much. We're, I mean, we have the main building is the finish mill and raw 
mill grinding building, which technically still you could consider outdoors too, because it's not 
heated or anything like that. And so, for pretty much any elements around the machinery and 
most of the time when we work on something, it is down and we are locking it out, tagging it 
out, making sure that nobody else works on it and we're trying it to make sure it's actually dead. 
And so, like I said before, it's all safety.  
 
VP: 
What is it like to work out in the elements?  
 
[00:10:03] 
 
MS: 
Some days can be challenging because, like this past week in spring, it's not supposed 
to be in the 90s, but it was. So, if you're, like especially the kiln area, that's a very hot area. So, 
if you're out there in a hot, humid day, it's challenging because you're sweating. And if you're 
around electrical stuff and you're sweating and you're more conductive and then you have the 
converse, which is in the winter, you could be up on the silos doing some wiring up there and 
it could be 30 mile-an-hour wind with wind chills down to negative 40 and that could be 
challenging. But most of the time, it's pretty pleasant.  
 
VP: 
What's it like to work around the dust?  
 
[00:10:49] 
 
MS: 
At first, when I started here as a laborer, it was, I actually thought, what did I get myself 
into? Because like I said, we take dirt and we grind it. And it's a very, very fine. It actually goes 
through a sieve in the lab that water will not pass through. So, we grind the stuff very, very 
fine. And I'm thinking I'm breathing this stuff. Now, we have respirators and all that other stuff. 
They give us the canister ones if we want to wear them. We have their N95s. But at first it was 
hard to get used to wearing all that. But after you were here a month or two, it was second 
nature. You go somewhere to clean and you'd come out and you'd be all dirty. It's almost like 
going in a coal mine. And so, it wasn't too bad. It took a little bit of getting used to. 
 
VP: 
Do you do something to make sure to not bring the dust home? 
 
MS: 
That's why the get a shower every night. I wear uniform as a part of my electrical gear, 
my safety stuff, because it's Nomex, but I have a locker which is clean clothing in and I don't 
put any work stuff in that locker and the same way with my work stuff, I won’t put my clean 
stuff in there. So, we keep them separated. So, I will take everything off, put it in my dirty 
5 
 
locker, get a shower, put everything in, take everything out of the clean locker and go home. 
So, we normally don't have a lot of transfer to go home.  
 
VP: 
And everyone does that? Everyone has two lockers?  
 
MS: 
Yeah, yeah. At least two, some have three.  
 
VP: 
Wow, what’s the third for? 
 
MS: 
Well, it's just like extra stuff. But that was yeah, I mean when I first started here and it 
was more for the older guys too, they had more people, but we had over 100 some people 
working on just the hourly side and now we're down to mid-eighties, high eighties. So, if you 
were working, you had a set of lockers in an area and all of a sudden three guys retired and 
they never replaced them. So, people just expanded out.  
 
VP: 
So how did you get involved with the labor union and what’s your involvement?  
 
[00:12:59] 
 
MS: 
Oh, well, currently I am the vice president of our local union. I was there recording 
secretary for seven years, but I got involved because my job prior to this, the one right out of 
school, I worked for a company called Dana Corporation and we made car frames down here 
in Redding. And all that closed. Like I said, my friend worked here, I got a job. And then I was 
involved with the union at Dana, because we had a lot of people and, well, here we have a 
better working relationship with management. Down there, it was a small management team 
and 3,000 people. So, there was a lot of a lot of people didn't know what they were doing. And 
so, but there were a lot of issues. But so, I got involved with that, go to meetings. And now, 
local union is supposed to work and everybody gives their input. And so, I got involved here, 
I’d go to meetings and then they started asking me, hey, we need somebody on a committee. 
Would you volunteer? OK, it's just started out that way. And here I am. I'm an elected position 
as the vice president, which I’ll see where that goes.  
 
VP: 
So, why did you get elected?  
 
MS: 
Oh, I was well, there was a guy who was our recording secretary years ago, was actually 
terminated, and they needed somebody that, I volunteered to fill his position. And then I got 
elected right after that. So, I was, that's why I was in seven years, I was two terms that I was 
elected for three years a term, and then one year that I filled in while he was actually out. So, 
I've been, well, this will be the eighth year.  
 
VP: 
And how many hours a week do you spend on union work?  
 
MS: 
It all depends. Usually, I'm going to say, we're discussing things with other committee 
members and talking to people at work and on the management team, maybe five hours a week 
on a normal week, which isn't bad. I mean, I signed into this and I got voted in and so I'm 24/7. 
If somebody would call my cell phone at home while I’m asleep, I'm going to get up and take 
care of it, so it doesn't bother me. And now, we do have weeks where, and it's not often, like 
somebody would get terminated. So, we have to file grievances and try to get their job back. 
And then we put in a lot of hours because we're doing a lot of discussions with everybody, our 
district representative and the person that was affected. And then you go to their house talking 
6 
 
to them, then you're talking on the phone, other people at management, back and forth, 
meetings, and it can be pretty hectic then. And you're looking at maybe 10, 15, 20 hours a 
week. But like I said, that's only happened twice since I'm on the committee.  
 
VP: 
Who else is on the committee?  
 
MS: 
Oh, we have our vice president John Suruly, who couldn't make it today because he was 
actually out for an injury, myself as vice president, and then Jeff Shucker as recording secretary, 
his brother is the financial secretary. And then we're actually all in agreement negotiation 
committee. In addition to that committee, we have Scott Schuman, who was a former vice 
president, and Mark Plucker, he's also on there. And then we have two alternates, which one, 
Jeff's already on the committee, but Warren Henry is also one of the alternates. Then we got 
other things like Civil and Human Rights Committee, which is, most of our committees are 
pretty much just a mix of the executive board and some other people.  
 
VP: 
And it's a mix of management and laborers?  
 
MS: 
No, it's all, it's all labor. But now we do have meetings once a month with management, 
we call them labor-management meetings. And they tell us what's going on in there. And as far 
as sales, the engineering part with repair and electric, and shipping, all that stuff, it's, they tell 
us everything. And then if we have any issues that we want to bring up the resolve without 
going through legal paperwork, that's when we bring everything up. But mostly as a committee, 
we try not to do any of the grievance stuff right away. We try to actually have a good 
relationship with Noelle, with HR and everybody else, so we can sit down and say hey, we 
have an issue here, this is what we're looking at, what can we do to resolve it? And most of the 
time, 90 percent, we do. So, it's not bad.  
 
VP: 
And my grievance is the grievance process like? 
 
MS: 
Oh, well, if somebody feels that they were like something was violated in the like … 
For instance, if somebody should have been asked for overtime and they asked somebody that 
didn't have that job for you overtime, in the contract, that's actually spelled out in black and 
white. So, then we have to file a grievance on that. Well, first we have to talk to the foreman, 
say, hey, you didn't pay this guy, you should be paying him because he should have been asked, 
not this guy. And then, if that guy says no, well, then we have to file a grievance, that's the 
second part. And then we have a meeting between local management here and our local union. 
And it'll go to the next step, if they would say no, we would go to the district level, which 
would be Noelle’s supervisor and then our district and representative. Then we'd all sit in a 
meeting and go from there. And then we have to decide if we're going to go to arbitration, 
which I think we were only at arbitration twice since I've been on the committee. 
 
VP: 
Over what? 
 
MS: 
One was a termination that went all the way to arbitration and the other one was, we 
had an issue, when I took over this job that the paperwork was atrocious, nothing was filed, 
nothing was organized. So, I took this because all these boxes of paperwork and sifted through 
everything, filed their bidding, got everything. And I started scanning everything to put it on 
digital form. And I found this old agreement that was signed between an old union president 
and management at that point that there wouldn't be any cameras in the washhouse. And there 
is one. Hmm, it turned out they didn't have the paper either. I found it and it was like five years 
7 
 
old. So, we took that to arbitration, but then we lost because it wasn’t recorded in a timely 
manner. But yeah, well, it's, you win some, you lose some. But they did agree that [unclear], 
which is great. That's all we wanted anyway.  
 
VP: 
So, when I did the workers of the plant unionize? 
 
MW: Oh boy, I'm not sure what year, but it was a long time ago. It might have been right 
when they opened the plane up in 1900s. But as far as, well, back then it was PACE, it was 
paper and chemical workers and all that, but it was a whole laundry list of all the disciplines 
that were in one union. And then we amalgamated with the United Steelworkers back in 1998, 
I believe it was.  
 
VP: 
What do the workers think about the union?   
 
MS: 
They’re positive towards the union because we work towards their best interests. And 
like I said, everybody here, now we are a smaller workforce and we're, where I worked before, 
if you were in the executive committee, you were actually in an office building. You were away 
from the workforce. So, they really didn't have access to you other than stopping after work in 
the office. Here, we’re actually working. We don't have a full-time position where we're just 
getting paid to do union stuff. So, we're accessible to everybody at any time. And like I said 
before, everybody knows their cell phone numbers, it's actually posted, if you need off-shift 
representation, they can get a hold of you anyway. They can get all your Facebook and social 
media, text messages, calling you on the phone, seeing you here at work. They have instant 
access so they can say, hey, I don't think this is right. Can we do something about this, or? So, 
they like that fact about the union that there's instant access and availability to voice their 
opinions and concerns.  
 
VP: 
So, how did the union respond to the pandemic or how did it respond to the change in 
work conditions?  
 
[00:21:14] 
 
MS: 
The company had come to us and asked, well, they were mainly concerned. Number 
one, the mass that was there was no give and take on that one, that was mandatory. But as far 
as social distancing, they had asked us that maybe, like in each department, like, for instance, 
the repair gang, there were 20 guys, they split their shifts, they asked for volunteers to work 
five to one, and then the rest of them work seven to three. So, they wouldn't all be in the shower 
room or in the break rooms together at one time. And they asked us to, I mean, and we did that 
on electric. We picked different areas for people to eat. And sometimes we even stagger our 
lunches depending on how bad it actually was. And we actually work with the company very 
well, I think, to mitigate our losses here at the plant. Now, there’s, myself included, there were 
some times with contact tracing that you were out of work for a while, which doesn't feel good, 
but at least we got paid for it with the unemployment. So, it didn't hurt too bad, but. I think 
overall the union work with the company really well on the pandemic. I mean, they did ask us 
for our input and we gave it and everything worked pretty well.  
 
VP: 
What do you think are some of the challenges that the union will be facing post the 
pandemic?  
 
8 
 
MS: 
Now, the biggest one right now and not really post-pandemic because it was before the 
pandemic also, is usually health insurance because that's a major cost for the employer. So, it's 
always, they’re trying to cut their costs because they don't want to raise the price of the material. 
We don't want to have to pay outrageous bills either. So, it's, that's and I think that relates to 
every industry across the board in the United States right now—health insurance. That is one 
of the huge ones that and I think also we're going to be facing the right to work thing that's 
going on, well has been going on, but we'll be facing that. And what is still the one … those 
are the two main ones right now, I think. But there's little stuff that seems to, like I said, not 
just in the cement industry, it just parallels everywhere. It's this pushback from corporations 
and stockholders and all that stuff, so.  
 
VP: 
So, what would you say is your favorite thing about your job? What do you like most 
about working in the plant and in the industry?  
 
[00:24:03] 
 
MS: 
Oh, my favorite job right now is just being an electrician, because since we went to 
school, we learned everything has, that's in the code book and everything else, we're pretty 
much. OK, this is what we want done and we're left to our own devices to get it done. As far 
as what size conduit we need, how we're going to run it, where we're going to run it, what kind 
of size are conductors we're going to pull. If we want to [unclear], we're pretty much left. OK, 
well, here's your job, here's your deadline. Do what you want to do, but get it done by this. And 
I like being creative. Because to me, running conduit is an art form. You have to have a knack 
for it, you have to be trained for it. You can't just screw together a piece of pipe and off it goes. 
You got to do a lot of offset bends, it's interesting group work and it's a lot of interesting stuff, 
in my opinion. That's what I like about my job, because I have the confidence of my superiors 
to say, look, this is what I want you to do. I know you're going to get it done. And they made 
me do it. I enjoy that, I have some freedom.  
 
VP: 
So, and wrapping up this interview, is there something that I didn't ask that maybe you 
would like to mention or to address?  
 
MS: 
Not really at this point, no.  
 
VP: 
Well, thank you so much for your time.  
 
MS: 
Oh, you're quite welcome. 
 
VP: 
It’s such a pleasure to speak to you and learn about your work.  
 
MS: 
I'm just glad I wasn't nervous.
