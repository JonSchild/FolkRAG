THE CIIAMIAN SISTEES' 
SONGSTER. 
,. Containing a Very Large Number of the Best . and Most Popular 
SONGS, BALLADS, AND DUETS, 
As Sung by those Beautiful and Accomplished Performers, 
BLANCHE AND ELIA 
--
These young ladies are steadily rising in popular favor, They have 
no English antecedents, 
They are thoroughly and entirely Southern 
in parentage, and American in education. They have a 
claim upon all 
who are disposed to encourage native talent, and to foster a national 
school of independent art-development. We are somewhat weary of 
Parisian drolleries, as well as of the witchery of Anglican blondes. 
The trans-atlantic charm a 
is deadened; our seaboard is this season in-
clined to emancipate itself from the spell of European sorecries. 
The 
'West will doubtless follow its example. When we possess such attrac-
tions as the Chapman Sisters at home, it is idle to go abroad in the vain 
searcli of superior merit. Every month that adds to the triumph, also 
adds to the proficiency of these charming young ladies. 
They are 
steadily and rapidly improving in their professitn. 
They have not 
re:who certain point of excellence and placidly remained there. 
Their 
is Exciit.ston. 
They display a 
versatility that seems ex-
haustless. 
They rintlerstand the precise requirements of popular 
taste, and know how to meet and anticipate it exactly. 
BLANciiE is not only an Actress, but a 
Songstress. With a 
little 
more practice'sho would rank as high in Comic Opera as she does in 
Burlesque. Tier voice, like her person, is in its first youth. But, with 
or without music, she has not her equal on the stage. 
Along with her 
archness, she can be -pathetic too when she pleases. 
Ambitious, ver-
satile, quick, gifted, sue only requires a fair field, and adequate en-
couragement, to create a 
name that shall be a 
present power and per-
petual remembrance. 
ELLA is younffer ; she has not the golden voice of BLANCHE, but she 
is an actress to the tips of her lingers. 
t"he has, r. quiet, winning way 
that sometimes goes farther than the more pronounced paces of her 
sister. 
She sopplies precisely what ELANCTIF, lacks.

LADY BIRD. 
As Sung by the CHAPMAN SISTERS. 
By GEORGE H. Mims. 
Lady Bird, Lady Bird, 
Are you looking for a 
nest ? 
You may choose around my mansion, 
Any spot that suits you best. 
'Neath the trellis, in the garden, 
There's a 
shadow steeped in dew 
'Neath the linden, by the grotto, 
There's another out of view. 
Lady Bird, Lady Bird, 
Will you ever keep away? 
Just as near, but never nearer, 
Just to-day, where yesterday. 
While to me with every moment, 
You have dearer, dearer grown, 
'Till at last in all the valleys, - 
There's no music but your own. 
Lady Bird, Lady Bird, 
I 
have paid you song for song; 
Not for all the sun shines over 
Would I 
stoop to do you wrong. 
Wing of gold and voice of silver, 
Fly away forever free; 
Go teach others half the music, 
That you might have made for me. 
YOU AND I 
ARE FRIENDS. 
AS Sung by the CHAPMAN SISTERS. 
You and I 
are henceforth friends, 
Whom nothing but death shall part 
For the rarest gift heaven sends 
Is a 
man after one's own heart. 
So give us your hand, my man, 
And lead the way to your table, 
For well drink just as long as we can, 
Hip, hip ! 
And eat just as long as we're able. 
By G. H. MILES 
You and I 
are friends for to-night, 
But never a 
moment more ; 
Our friendship ends with the morning light, 
For such was the oath I 
swore. 
But give me your ham!, my man, 
And I'll show you the way to my table, 
Where we'll drink just as long as we can, 
Hip, hip! 
And eat just as long as we're able.

Ii 
MY LITTLE LUTE AND I. 
As. sung by the CHAPMAN SISTEILS. 
By CIIJIWE H. MILES. 
From town, to town, we wander, 
My little Lute and I, 
The pretty stars up yonder, 
Perhaps may tell you why. 
I 
only know where'er we go 
Vvre find a 
home beneath the sky. 
We ask each hill, and mountain, 
If home at length is nigh, 
We ask each rill, and fountain, 
And thus they all reply ; 
Sing bravely on some distant morn 
You'll find a 
home above the sky. 
BRING THY SHATTERED HEART TO ME. 
I 
know there is no beauty in mine eyes or on my brow, 
To lure thee from the pleasures that surround thy pathway now ; 
I 
know thy youthful dreamings are of fairer forms than mine, 
And voices far more musical are mingled oft with thine; 
But oh ! when false enjoyments shall have lost their charms for 
thee, 
When thy every trust is broken—bring thy shattered heart 
to me. 
The smiles of fleeting friendship may still hover round thee 
now, 
And life, to thee so joyous, bring no care-marks on thy brow; 
'Tis not when these elate thee, I 
would claim 'dee as my own, 
But, dear one, I 
would shield thee, when thy heart is sad and 
Ione. 
But oh! when false enjoyments shall have lost their charm for 
thee, 
When thy every trust is broken—bring thy shattered heart to 
me. 
SNEEZING SONG. 
As Sung by Miss BLANCHE CHAPMAN. 
Ye gentlemen and ladies fair, 
Of my affliction pity take, 
For when I 
show the greatest care 
A perfect sound I 
cannot make. 
I 
stammer when I 
try to sing, 
The more I 
strive, the worse it grow% 
And oh, it is such a.little sting, 
This tickling in my nose. 
cuonus 
Bahl Bahl Bah! 
Tral, lal, la, la, etc. [ Sneeze.] 
If I 
to soiree dare to go, 
With ladies of manners fine, 
And they should ask a 
sweet morccaux, 
I 
could not sing a 
simple line; 
My voice it then begins to fail, 
The company impatient grows, 
I 
tell them 'tis of no avail, 
This tickling in my nose, 
Bah I Bahi te.

I NEVER WAS SO HAPPY IN MY LIFE. 
-Written for ELLA CHAPMAN by D. 
L. 
GIBSON of Cincinnati. 
I 
never was so happy in my life, I'm here to tell to you 
How I 
fell in love one night last week with a 
charming girl in 
blue. 
'Twas at a 
fancy masquerade where mirth and joy did reign, 
Aly love was there as a 
gipsy queen, while I 
was King of Spain. 
You ought to see her dancing, • 
Her pretty little dark eyes glancing 
So lovingly on me; oh ! she filled my heart with sunshine that 
rippled thro' her hair, 
I'll never find in all this world another girl so fair. 
Oh, how my heart went pitty pat, when first I 
led her to the 
dance, 
Her little hand was held in mine, how could I 
lose the chance 
To ask if I 
might see her home, when ere she chose to go, 
I 
really thought that I 
should die if she should answer no. 
But then she looked so smiling; 
Her pretty ways beguiling, 
As she said yes to me; oh I

I'LL BE WAITING IN THE DELL. 
As Sung by Inss BLANCHE CHAPMAN. 
When the purple hue of sunset, 
Tints the ivy on the mill, 
And the rose and lilly slumber, 
By the margin of the rill. 
When flowers their secrets murmur, 
By the brook we love so well, 
Don't forget, oh don't forget love, 
be waiting in the dell. 
CHORUS. 
I'll be waiting, I'll be waiting, 
be waiting, I'll be waiting, 
Don't forget, oh don't forget, love, 
I'll be waiting in the dell. 
Come, my love, and I 
will whisper, 
flow I 
waited all the day, 
While my heart was ever with you, 
With you all the live-long day. 
When the winds are softly sighing 
And you hear the vesper bell, 
Don't forget, oh don't forget, love, 
I'll be waiting in the dell. 
CHORUS. 
I'll be waiting, 
be waiting, 
By the path we love so well, 
Don't forget, oh don't forget, love., 
I'll be waiting in the dell. 
THE MOUSE-TRAP MAN. 
As Sung in the Burlesque of " Pluto," by Miss A LICE D UP.:M.G. 
Kind friends in me you an object behold. 
Wounded in Lelings, and minus his heart. 
lov'd a 
girl., but by her I've been kola, 
All for a 
mouse- trap man spicy and smart. 
Outside her door loudly bawling 
go 
"Mouse-traps a 
penny" thro'-out all the day. 
In her good graces, he soon got, I 
know, 
Caught her with " mouse-traps" and stole her away! 
CHORUS. 
'Mouse-traps, mouse-traps,' he'd cry, 
• 
Mouse-traps, fine mouse- traps' who'll buy 
Strong as a 
house, just have one and try, 
Mouse-traps a 
penny, a 
penny, who'll buy F" 
In a 
dark corner this trap she did .fix, 
Baited each hook with a piece of burnt cheese, 
Woke up next morning and there she found six 
Poor little mouses as dead as you please 
When she diskivered 'em, she cried ' 0 lor, 
Never before was the like seen of sitch, 
Him as brought that ere mntsetrap to the door, 
I'm sure he's a 
conjuror, leastways a 
witch: 
Mousetraps, mousetraps, Sze. 
No more cold wittles I 
got from that day, 
All of her ' perkisites' went to that chap, 
'When I 
asked for ' em, she used for to say, 
As how she wanted 'em to bait the trap. 
'That may be true,' said I, 
but, 'p'raps you'll tell, 
Where. are the governor's left off suits % 
You must have them for you know very well, 
They don't bait mousetraps with old trousers and boots! 
Mousetraps, mousetraps, & c. 
She kick'd rae out, slarnm'd the door in my face, 
Sent me adrift with a 
flea in my ear, 
She'd guy me 
turnips,' and it was a 
case,' 
I 
was outrivalled by that chap, 'twas clear, 
Last Sun :1.3r week they were man and wife made, 
Which fill'd by buzzum with , i•rief, care and woe ; 
Now they are doing a 
fine roaring trade, 
For mousetraps a

Cheer up, Annie darling, with hopeful emotiolA, 
To-morrow our parting must be; 
I'll sail the seas over, I'll cross the wide ocean, 
sail the seas over far thee; 
I'll not forget thee, oh I

I

Thy smile, like a

Good-by, Annie, darling

I'll cross the wide ocean, 
I'll cross the wide ocean for thee,-
I 
go, Annie darling, but leave thee in sorrow; 
I 
go for thy sake far away, 
Then bid me good-bye, with a 
smile on the morrow, 
And cheer me with blessings I 
pray. 
I'll think of thee ever, and pray for thee, 
As over the waters I 
roam; 
I'll tarry not darling, and leave thee all lonely, 
But hasten again to my home. 
Good-bye, Annie, darling, 
Out, out on the ocean, away o'er the billow, 
My heart on its purpose intent, 
My brow shall find rest, when I 
seek my lone pillow, 
In knowing that thou art content. 
Cheer up, Annie, darling, break off from thy sorrow: 
'Tis sad that our parting must be: 
But give me thy smile, when I 
leave thee, to-morrow, 
To sail the seas over for thee. 
Good-bye, Annie, darling, &a

KATIE'S SECRET. 
The sunlight is beautiful, Mother, 
• And sweetly the flowers bloom to-day, 
And birds, in the branches of hawthorn, 
Are caroling ever so gay: 
And down by the rock in the meadow. 
The rill ripples by with a 
song; 
And, Mother, I, too, have been singing., 
The merriest all the day long. 
Last night, I 
was weeping, dear Mother, 
Last night, I 
was weeping alone: 
The world was so dark and so dreary, 
My heart it grew as heavy as stone; 
I 
thought of the lonely and loveless, 
All lonely and loveless was' I: 
I 
scarcely could tell why it was, Mother, 
But, oh! I 
was wishing to die. 
Last night, I 
was weeping, dear Mother, 
But Willie came down by the gate, 
And whispered : 
Come out in the moonlight, 
I've something to say to you, Kate. 
Oh ! Mother, to him I 
am dearer 
Than all in the wide world beside; 
lie told me so, out in the moonlight, 
And called me his darling, his bride. 
So now I 
will gather my roses, 
And twine in my long, braided hair. 
Then Willie will come in the evening, 
And smile when he sees me so fair. 
And out, in the moonlight, we'll wander, 
Way down by the old hawthorn-tree: 
! 
Mother, I 
wonder if any 
Were ever so happy as we.

THE SWEETEST OF THEM ALL. 
Written by W ILL S, 
HATS of Louisvillle, Ky. 
A.s Sung by ELLA CnArmAN. 
I 
have met a 
charmer, she's sweet to gaze upon. 
When at first you see her face, you'll feel"your heart is gone, 
She wears her dresses " en panier," and sports a 
waterfall, 
And of all the charming girls in town, she's the sweetest of 
them all, 
ClIOR178. 
Oh my! Oh dear I 
You may talk about your pretty girls, the fair, fat, short and tall, 
But Nancy Ann Amanda Jane is the sweetest of them all. 
She plays upon the piano, the jewsharp and bazoon, 
And when she hasn't got a 
cold, sings " Up in a 
balloon ; " 
She goes to balls and parties, and when her name they call, 
The men all stop to look and see the sweetest of them all. 
Oh my! Oh dear I &c. 
I 
asked her if she'd have me, she smiled and said, " you bet," 
And whispered gently in my ear, " we may be happy yet." 
There's going to be a 
wedding, sometime late in the fall, 
And I'm to be the better half, of the sweetest of them all. 
Oh my I Oh dear I &c. 
rm going to build a 
mansion, with a 
big plate on the door, 
And put my name upon it, A. Junius Brutus Moore. 
I;tu going to give a 
party and invite you folks to call 
To se how happy I 
will be with the sweetest of them all. 
Oh my I Oh dear! eze.

I 
watched bersup the stairs, 
Where we to supper went, 
Upon those tassels on the boots, 
My soul was so intent; 
They asked me to propose a 
health, 
'Said 1 
here's one that suits, 
So fill your glasses up and drink, 
To the tasseli on the boots. 
I 
meant to drink the ladle's healths, bed I 
could think of nothing 
Those tassels on the boots-
I 
asked this girl " if I 
Might call," she said " you may, 
But tell me why you gaze upon, 
The ground in such a 
way? 
You're sad, perhaps, for life is full 
Of very bitter fruits," 
"Oh no," I 
said" I'm looking at 
Those tassels on your boots."

What is a 
more lovely sight, when you walk down Itment 
street than to look at-Those tassels on the boots.

but-
As Sang by Miss BLANCHE CHAPMAN. 
When I 
go on the street to walk, 
I 
look so fine and gay, 
The people stop to look at me, 
I've stu:,11 
winning way, 
I'm not the one to hesitate, 
But please the best I 
can. 
And all the ladies take to me, 
I'm such a 
winning man. 
Oh look at me, and gaze at me, 
I'll bet a 
double span, 
That all the pretty girls will say, - 
He's just the winning man. 
I 
get myself up free of charge, 
For any ball or show, 
And then I 
call on all the b'hoys, 
To tell them I 
shall go, 
Then each one tries to buy me off, 
And I 
get all I 
can, 
Or else I 
go and cut them out, 
I'm such a 
winning man. 
Oh look at me, and gaze at me. 
And beat me if you can, 
I 
know the ladies here will say, 
I'm such a 
winning man. 
A young chap once came up to me, 
Says he, " Id like to know, 
How you charm all the pretty girls, 
And make them like yon so." 
Says I, " Young man, go ask your ma, 
Or else your sister Fan, 
And they will tell you why, ' Because— 
He's such a 
winning man.'" 
Oh look at me, and gaze at me, 
And beat me if you can. 
Every body's sister smiles 
On such a 
winning man. 
THE BIG SUN-FLOWER. 
There is a 
charm I 
can't explain 
About a 
girl I've seen, 
And my heart beats fast when she goes past 
In a 
dark dress trimmed with green. 
Her eyes are bright as evening stars, 
So lovely and so shy, 
And the folks all stop and. look around 
Whenever she goes by. 
' 
And I 
feel just as happy as a 
big Stn.-flower 
That nods and bends in the breeze, 
And my heart is as light as the wind that blows 
The leaves from off the treeses. 
As time passed on and we became 
Like friends of olden time, 
I 
thought the question I 
v;ould pop 
And ask her to be mine. 
But the answer I 
received next day, 
How could. she treat me so, 
For instead of being mine for life, 
She simply answered No! 
I 
called next day dressed in my best, 
My fair one for to see, 
And asked her if she would. explain 
Why she had jilted. me. 
She said she really felt quite sad, 
To cause me such distress, 
And when I 
said, now do be mine, 
Why of course she answered, yes. 
And I

PntALING HARD AGAINST THE STREAM 
[CONCLUDED.] 
Many a 
bright, good-hearted fellow, 
Many a 
noble-minded man, 
Finds himself in water shallow; 
Then, assist him, if you can. 
Some succeed at every turning, 
Fortune favors every scheme, 
Others, too—tho' more deserving, 
Have to pull against the stream. 
So then, do your best, Sze. 
If the wind is in your favor, 
And you've weathered every squall, 
Think of those who luckless labor, 
Never get fair winds at all: 
Working hard, contented, willing, 
Struggling thro' life's ocean wide; 
Not a 
friend, and not a 
shilling, 
Pulling hard against the tide. 
So then, do your best, ttc. 
Don't give way to foolish sorrow, 
Let this keep you in good cheer; 
Brighter days may come to-morrow, 
If you try and persevere; 
Darkest nights will have a 
morning, 
Tho' the sky be overcast; 
tongest lanes must have a 
turning. 
And the tide will turn at last. 
o 
then, do your best,

SW EET GENEVIEVE. 
Words by GEORGE COOMIL 
Music by ITP.NRY TUCKER. 
EITEntr 
COMPOSER. 
„7Oar readers will thank us for giving a 
slight sketch of ono who has fo 4 
maw; years contributed to their pleasure by ihe medium of his exquisit a 
eonp.s and ballads. 
Henry Tucker is a 
self made man in every respect. 
is a 
native of Cayuga Co., State of New York, a 
County, by the by, 
vaih has given birth to many remarkable men. At an early age tint 
alCoi set of tuis sketch developed decided musical talents. 
ills first 
frsolig—" The Forest Queen," appeared in 184'2, after which came 
" 
Agnei May," and " Star of the Evening." All of these songs were 
successful, and then followed a 
delicious tide of pure and beautiful 
melodies, that culminated in that outbreak of a 
Nation's hopes and 
fears— the universally popular, " When this cruel war is over.' 
-As far 
as popularity and simplicity and correctness of style are concerned, 
Henry Tucker stands to-day highest among our native composers. 
In 
character he is a 
kind, genial gentleman—the idol of his many friends. 
His name ;s 
a synonym of all that is agreeable in social intercourse. 
In fact, Henry Tucker—with story—is e 
popular saying in New York 
circles. 
His latest composition, ' Sweet Genevieve,' shows that his 
Lyre has not yet lost its wonderorts charm. 
Ile is at present engaged 
in editing a 
series of popular Music for R. M. DeWitt. To use an 
Arabic expression, may Henry Tucker's " shadow never grow less," 
at may the world still be charmed by his heart-moving melodies.j 
0. Genevieve. I'd give the world, 
To live again the lovely past; 
The rose of youth was dew impearl'd, 
But now it withers in the blast. 
I 
see thy face in e-Jery dream. 
My waking thoughts are full of thee; 
Thy glance is in the starry beam, 
That falls along the summer sea. 
CHORUS.

Genevieve, sweet Genevieve, 
The days may come, the days may go; 
But still the hands of mem'ry weave, 
The blissful dream of long ago. 0, Genevieve! 
Fair Genevieve, my early love, 
The years but make thee dearer far, 
My heart shall never, never rove, 
Thou art my only guiding star, 
For me the past has no ^egret, 
T.Vhat e'er the years may bring to me, 
I 
bless the hour when first we ne-t. 
The hour that gave we love and thee.

LOVE NOT. 
Love not! love not! ye hapless sons of clay, 
hope's gayest wreaths are made of earthly flowers 
Things that are made to fade and fall away, 
lire they have blossom'd for a 
few short hours. 
Love not I

Love not! love not! the thing you love may die, 
May perish from. the gay and gladsome earth: 
The silent stars, the blue and smiling sky, 
Beam on its 0-rave, as once upon its birth. 
Love not! love net! 
Love not! love not 
the thing you love may change, 
The rosy lip may cease to smile on you! 
The kindly beaming eye grow cold and strange, 
The heart still warmly beat, yet not be true. 
Love not! love not! 
Love not! love not! 0 
warning vainly said 
In present hours, as in years gone by, 
Love flings a 
halo round the dear cue's Leacl, 
Faultless, immortal, till they change or die. 
Love not! love not!

For, she looked, dm 
It's my Juliana-Phebiana-Constantina Brown;

COME IN AND SHUT THE DOOR. 
0, do not stand so long outside, 
Why need you be so shy ? 
The people's ears are open, John, 
As they are passing by I 
You cannot tell what they may think; 
They've said strange thaws before. 
And it' you wish to talk awhile, 
Come in and shut the door. 
CHORUS. 
Come in, come in, come in, come in, 
Come in, conic in, come in sou shut the door. 
Nay, do not say: " No, thank you, Jane," 
with such a 
bashful snule. 
You said when ladies widspered, No I 
They meant— Yes ! all the while.

It don't look well to stand out here. 
Come in and shut the door. 
Come in, come in, come in, 4ite. 
You say I 
did not answer you 
To what you said, last night--
I 
heard your question in the dark; 
Thought on it in the high:— 
And now my lips shall utter 
What my heart has said before  
Yes, dearest, I...... but, wait a

Come in and shut the door. 
Come in, come in, come in, &c.

Or what some would call 'servant gal; 
My missis she calls me Sairah, 
But father for short calls me " Sal ;"

From morning until night.

At a

They comes out like a 
Dook and a 
Duchess, 
How they does it to some's not quite clear ; 
They- give parties and hold up their heads. 
As though they was first of the land; 
Sometimes I've to wait for my wages, 
Whilst they get a

THE BASHFUL GIRL. 
[As sung by Miss PAULINE MAREHA31.i 
Words and Music by LAUNOE LENNOX 
Pm a tuid, bashful thing, 
How 1 
ti-ty—ti-ty trem-ble, 
Seeing just to hear me sing 
Such a 
mill itudo am,einble 1 
0, pray do•i' t, or I 
wont 
Sing a 
note if anybody look at me 
How I 
quake, how I 
shake, 
Verily, timidity's a 
dreadful thing. 
• 
Gentlemen I 
chance to meet, 
Make me tr nny-ninny-ninny nervous. 
And I 
never walk the street, 
Without saying " Heaven Preserve us!" 
How they stare, I 
declare, 
I 
at once got red as any peony; 
Look so meek that they speak, 
Verily, timidity's a 
dreadful thing. 
If I 
only had a 
friend 
Like a 
bibby-bibliy--hrother, 
Telling me my faults to mend 
Aadhthis silly shyness smother, 
I 
can find a 
man, 
Who believes in love that is platonical, 
Jmight get courage yet, 
Verily timidity's a 
dreadful thing. 
HERE'S A HEALTH TO THEE, TOM MOORE. 
Words by LORD BYRON. 
Music by MICHAEL KELLY. 
My boat is on the shore, and my bark is on the sea; 
But before I 
go, To n 
Moore, here's a 
double health to thee, 
Here's a 
double health to thee. 
Here's a 
sigh for those that love, and a 
smile for those who 
hate, 
And whatever sky's a'iove, here's a 
heart for every fate. 
Tho the ocean roars around me, yet it still shall bear me on ; 
Tho' a 
desert shall surround me, it hath springs that may be 
11,011. 
Wer't the last drop in the well, as I 
gasp up ii the brink, 
Ere my sinking spirits fell, ' tis 
t 
at I 
would drink. 
In this water as this wine, the libations I 
would pour, 
Should be peace to thee and thine, and a 
health to thee, Tom 
Moore, 
A 
health to thee, a 
health to thee, a 
health to thee, Tom 
Moore. 
ISLE OF BEAUTY. 
Shades of evening, close not o'er us, 
Leave our lonely bark an bile, 
Morn, alas ! will not restore us 
Yonder dim and distant isle. 
Still my fancy can discover 
Sunny spots where friends may dwell, 
Darker shadows round us hover, 
Isle of beauty, fare thee well. 
'Tis the hour when happy faces, 
Smile around the taper's light, 
Who will fill our vacant places P 
Who will sing our songs to-night ? 
What would I 
not give to wander 
Where my old ....:::npanions dwell ? 
Absence makes the heart grow fonder, 
Isle of beauty, fare thee well. 
I'LL BE NO SUBMISSIVE WIFE. 
Words by T. ILBAYLY. 
Music by ALEXANDER LEE 
I'll be no submissive wife, 
No, no, not I; 
I'll not be a 
slave for life, 
No, not I, no, not I; 
Think you on a 
wedd ng day, 
That I'd say, as others say, 
Love, honor, and obey ? 
No not I, no not I. 
I 
to dullness don't incline, 
No not I, no not I! 
Go to bed at half-past nine— 
No not I, no not 1! 
Should a 
humdrum husband say, 
That at home I 
ought to stay— 
Do you think that I'll obey, 
No not I, no not I,

Her eyes were bright, her step was light; 
Her conversation charming. send her figure slight,

This fairy queen's enchanting mien, 
Like me it would have been, 
With you quite up a

Or go to sea, a

She said, 
You silly fellow, better marry me. 
And stop at home for love."

Gained consent, quite content, 
The invitations all are sent, 
And I'm going to marry my dove.

TIE SAILOR'S GRAVE. 
Our bark was far, far from the land, 
WIL,n 
the fairest of our gallant band. 
•Graw deadly pale, and waned away, 
bike the twilight of an autumn day. 
We had watch'd him through long hours of pain, 
Oar cares were great, our hopes in vain : 
Death's stroke ho gave no coward's-alarms, 
But he smiled, and died in his messmate's arms 
We had no costly winding- sheet, 
We placed two round shot at his feet : 
Be lays in his hammock as snug and as sound 
As a 
king, in his long shroud, marble-bound.; 
We proudly decled his funeral vest 
With the Starry- Flag upon his breast 
We gave him this as a 
h.dge of the brave, 
And then he was fit for a.sallor's grave. 
Our voices broke, and hearts turned weak ; 
Oft tears were seen on the brownest cheek .; 
The quiver played on the hp of pride, 
As we lower'd him down the ship's dark side; 
'Then a 
splash and a 
plunge, and our tisk was o'er, 
And the billows rolled aq they rolled before, 
And many wile prayers hallowd the wave, 
And he sank beneath in a 
sailor's grave.

BITTER BEER.. 
As sung by the GREAT IANGIR" 
The subject of my little song, 
Is one I 
hold most dear, 
It supports our Constitution, 
And it will for many a 
year; 
John :Cc.dl would surely be defunct, 
Or ..
SC1 look rather queer, 
If Bass & Co. should cease to brew 
Their glorious " Bitter Beer." 
CHORUS. 
Allsop, Bass & Co., they each deserve a monument, so 1,110 
them whib we're here, 
Three cheers for .3-
ts.s and Allsop, and their glorious " Bitter 
Beer." 
I've tasted " Hock " and Claret too, 
Madeira and Moselle, 
Not one of those boshy wines 
Revives this languid swell; 
Of all complaints from " A 
to Z," 
The fact is very clear, 
There's no disease but what's been cured 
Py Bass's " Bitter Beer." 
Allsop, Bass & Co., &c.. 
I've lived in Scotland many years, 
And drank its mountain dew, 
I 
don't deny but what it's good, 
And a 
stimulant, it's true. 
I'm far from being prejudiced, 
As many think, I 
fear, 
But give to me a 
coding draught, 
Of Bass's " Bitter Beer." 
Allsop, Bass & Co., &a.. 
*Pronounced " Bit-tah Bee-at..." 
FIVE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING. 
Words and Music by CLAPABEL. 
The dew lay glittering o'er the grass, 
A mist lay over the brook, 
At the earliest beam of the golden sun, 
The swallow her nest forsook. 
The snowy blooms of the hawthorn tree, 
Lay thickly the ground adorning, 
The birds were singing in every bush 
At five o'clock in the morning. 
The birds were singing in every bush 
At five o'clock in the morning. 
And Bessie, the milkmaid, merrily sang, 
For meadows were fresh and fair. 
The breeze of the morning k 
ssed her brow, 
And payed with her nut-brown hair, 
But oft she turned and looked around, 
As if the silence scorning; 
'Twas time for the mower to whet his scythe, 
At five o'clock in the morning, 
'Twas time for the mower to whet his scythe, 
At five o'clock in the morning. 
And over the meadow the mowers came, 
And merry their voices rang, 
And one among them wended his way, 
To where the milkmaid sang. 
And as he lingered by her side, 
Despite his comrade's warning, 
The old, old story was told again, 
At five o'clock in the morning. 
The old, old story was told again, 
At five o'clock in the morning.

CAPTAIN DE WELLINGTON BOOTS. [CONCLUDED.] 
You may talk of the Bar or the Navy, 
My life beats the couple to smash, 
You can get a 
fine post in the Army, 
That is if you've got but the cash; 
My dad you must know was a " grocer," 
Who contrived to scrape up a 
good sum, 
Bought me a 
commission with " sugar," 
And. afterwards left me a " plum." '

LITTLE BARE-FOOT. 
W ords and Music by FRANK HOWARD. 
Sung by Miss MAGGIE M ITCHELL in the popular Drama of" Little Rare. 
Foot: , 
Who has not while traversing the crowded thoroughfare 
of our different cities, been saluted, by the subject of this song, 
with the well-known appeal of: Mister: Please give me a 
penny—for, I've not got any- Pa—Please, Sir, give me just oni 
penny, I 
want to buy some bread for Ma. 
Standing where the bleak winds whistled 
• 
Round her small and fragile form, 
Arms within torn garments nestled, 
Standing there at night and morn; 
Hundreds passing by unheeding, 
'Cept to jostle her aside. 
There, with bare feet cold and ;bleeding, 
She, in tones of anguish, cried : 
Mister: Please give me a 
penny, 
For, I've not got any Pa, 
Please, sir, give me just one penny, 
I 
want io buy some bread for Mal 
CHORUS. 
While we beg for those with plenty, 
And for them to us unknown, 
We'll not forget our little " bare-foots," 
They are HEATHENS nearer home. 
Hailing thus each passing stranger, 
As they hurriedly went by, 
Some would turn and gaze upon her, 
Pity beaming from their eye; 
Others cast a 
frown upon her, 
Heeding not the plaintive cry: 
I 
must have some bread for Mother, 
Or with hunger she will die: 
Mister: Please give me a 
penny, 
For, I've not got any Pa, 
Please, sir, give me just one penny, 
I 
want to buy some bread for Ida! 
While we beg, &.41 
There, one chilly day in Winter, 
BARE-FoOT sat upon the nave ; 
Ont-stretch'd were her little fingers,. 
But no pennies did sbe crave, 
DAISY DEANE. 
There, while begging bread for Mother, 
Death had chilled her little heart. 
Yet, each day, we see some other 
Playing LITTLE BARE-FOOT'S part: 
Mister; Plea e 
give me a 
penny, 
For, I've not got any Pa, 
Please, sir, give me just one penny, 
I 
want to buy some bread for Ma! 
While we beg, & c. 
DAISY DEANE. 
'Twas down in the meadows, the violets were blowing, 
And the Spring-time grass was fresh and green ; 
And the birds, by the brooklet, their sweet songs were singing, 
When I 
first met my darling Daisy Deane. 
None knew thee but to love thee, thou dear one of my heart; 
Oh! thy memory is ever fresh and green; 
Thowxli the sweet buds may wither, and fond hearts be broken, 
Still I 
love thee, my darling Daisy Deane. 
Her eyes soft and tender, the violas outvieing, 
And a 
fairer form was never seen; 
With her brown silken tresses, her cheeks like the roses, 
There was none like my darling Daisy Deane. 
None knew thee but, &c. 
The bright flowers are faded, the young grass has fallen, 
And a 
dark cloud hovers o'er the scene ; 
For the death-angel took her, and left me in sorrow 
For my lost one, my darling Daisy Deane. 
None knew thee but, &c. 
Oh! down in the meadows I 
still love to wander, 
Where the young grass grew so fresh and green 
But the bright golden visions of Spring-time have faded, 
With the lowers, and my darling Daisy Deane. 
None knew thee but, cto.

THE VELOCIPEDE.-[CONCLUDED.) 
'Twas when I 
went a 
racing 
One day upon the street, 
I 
met a 
lovely charmer— 
Our eyes they chanced to meet 
I 
touched my hat so neatly, 
My " challenge' she did heed--
She sailed— I 
followed after, 
On my gay velocipede I 
Whiz! Bang! Fiz! Clang! &o. 
Away we flew together— 
The folks they stopped and stared-
Policemen helloed after, 
But not a 
thing we eared. 
Her lovely curls were dancing, 
And faster went her steed 
I 
lost my hat and coat tails 
On my gay velocipede! 
Whiz! Bang! Fiz! Clang! &o. 
I 
tried to " rein " my " racer," 
But faster went instead ; 
Another mile we blustered, 
Which found us both " ahead I" 
A peanut stand before us, 
We neither one could. heed— 
We struck it, 0, and busted up 
Our gay velocipede! 
Whiz! Bang! Fiz! Clang! &e. 
But there came a 
fellow, 
A stylish sort of chap, 
He winked at my dulcinea; 
To me a 
dire mishap; 
They dashed away together— 
He calmly smoked his weed— 
And left me toddling after, 
On my gay velocipede! 
Whiz ! Bang! Viz! Clang! &b,

To cut a

For I'm their pet in the army.

CHORUS. 
I'm Cap-tain Jinks of the Horse Marines, 
I

Of course its quite beyond my moans, 
Tho' a 
Captain in the ar-my. 
I 
joined my corps when twenty-one, 
Of course I 
thought it capital fun. 
When the enemy came then off I

When I

Mama she cried, mama she cried,

SPOKEN—N-., she thought I 
was too young, but then, ) said, 
ah I 
mama, 
I'm Captain Jinks of the Horse Ma7ines, 
The first day I 
went out to drill, 
The bugle sound made me quite ill, 
At the Balance step my hat it fell, 
And that wouldn't do for the army. 
The officers they all did shout. 
They all cried out, they all did shout, 
The officers they all did shout, 
" 
Oh that's the curse of the army." 
SPOKEN.—Of course my hat did fall off, but ah I 
nevertheless, 
I'm Captain Jinks of the Horse Marines, 
My Tailor's bills came in so fast, 
Forced me one day to leave at last..

SPOKEN—I

SEVENTY-TWO.—[CoNcrcrDED.] 
In the red brick'd hall, with moss covered wall, 
Where my father he lived and died. 
I 
live at my ease, and do as I 
please. 
Caring nought for the world so wide— 
The pluck of a 
lion, a 
muscle of iron, 
And a 
heart that is honest and true, 
'Yet a 
heart that can always or others feel 
Altho' I'm Seventy-Two. 
Then cheer, boys, cheer, &c. 
No sluggard am I, in my bed to lie, 
I 
rise at early dawn. 
Thro' meadows I 
jog, with my gun and my dog, 
Or mount at the sound of the horn. 
A 
seat in the saddle I 
still can keep, 
With a 
heigh, Tally ho, halloo! 
For my limbs are strong, and my wind is long, 
Altho' I 
am Seventy-Two. 
Then cheer, boys, cheer, &c. 
At Christmas time, when the bells they chime, 
I've a 
welcome as well as a 
smile, 
And hearty goad cheer for peasant or peer, 
In a 
jolly old English style. 
I'm fond of good sport, yet, nevertheless, 
My passions I 
always subdue, 
For it's only a 
fool that loves excess, 
And will never reach Seventy-Two. 
Then cheer, boys, cheer, &c. 
YES OR NO. 
A smile now gathers round thy lip, 
But not a 
word or sigh 
Escapes to tell if I'm beloved, 
Or bid sad doubts to fly. 
I 
sue to thee, no crimson cheek, 
Reveals love's burniir glow, 
Have pity on my throbbing heart. 
Say Yes, my love, or No.

ELLA REE. 
Oh, Ella flee, so kind and true, 
In the little churchyard lies, 
Her grave is bright with drops of dew 
But brighter were her eyes. 
Then carry me back to Tennessee, 
There let me live and die, 
Among the fields of yellow corn, 
And the land where Ella lie. 
Her pretty eyes and gentle form, 
Methinks I 
yet can see, 
I 
love the spot where she was born, 
Way down in Tennessee, 
Then carry me back to Tennessee, .1 
There let me live and die, 
(
Repeat.) 
Among the fields of yellow corn, 
And the land where Ella lie. 
The summer moon will rise and set, 
And the night-birds trill their 1
,1y, 
And the posum and coon so softly step, 
Round the grave of Eila flee. 
Then carry me back to Tennessee, 
There let me live and die, 
Among the fields of yellow corn, 
And the land where Ella lie. 
(
Repeat.) 
THE MINSTREL BOY. 
(Repeat.) 
The minstrel boy to the war is gone, 
In the ranks of death you'll find him ; 
His father's sword he's girded on, 
And the wild harp strung behind him. 
Land of song— said the warrior bard, 
Though all the world betray thee, 
One s \vord at least its right shall guard, 
One faithful harp shall praise thee. 
The minstrel fell, but the foeman's chains 
Could not keep his proud soul under ; 
The harp he loved ne'er spoke again, 
Ile tore the strings asunder ; 
And said : " no chains shall sully thee, 
Thou soul of love and bravery, 
Thy songs were made for the pure a-nd frit. 
They shall never sound in slavery 1" 
I! I

NOT FOR JOSEPH. 
I've seen a 
bit of gaiety throughout my short career, 
I, once, was foolish with my tin, but I've paid most dear, 
If folks would seek to take me in, they find it is no go; 
I'm up to almost every thing: You can't get over Joe. 
CHORUS. 
Oh! dear, no I 
not for Joe—if he knows it—not for Joseph. 
Oh 1 
no, no! not for Joe—not for Joseph—oh! dear, no! 
The other day, I 
met a 
friend, we passed the time of day, 
And chatted gaily down Broadway: but ere I 
went away, 
I 
kindly asked the learned swell to take a 
parting drain, 
Oh! yes, said he, I 
think I 
will ; then let it be champagne. 
Spoken. — No, you don't, my dear fellow, you don't get 
champagne out of Joseph. 
Oh! dear, no, not! &c. 
Some time ago, a 
friend of mine, he asked me out to dine, 
And there he introduced me to one he called divine: 
He said she'd make a 
charming wife, and had such lots of tin: 
A widow only -Forty-two: go in, ray boy, and win. 
Spoken.—Matrimony and lots of money, and a 
widow only 
forty-two—well, the money is very good, but then—the widow. 
Oh! dear, no, not! &c. 
Of late, in town, there was a 
fuss about the Japs so grand: 
And, also, of the Russians who visited our land, 
And the country-companies we greeted with hearty cheers, 
We know they have been received well by the New York 
Volunteers. 
Spoken.- -What a 
glorious thing it is to fight and die for 
your country! 
What can be more glorious than a 
bullet in 
your eye? 'What can be more painful than a 
bullet in the 
eye ? 
Nothing I 
should think— 
Oh! dear, no, not! &c. 
And now, perhaps, I've sung my song, you might be in the 
cue, 
To show you kind acknowledgement, but that with me won't 
do, 
As for to-night I've done my best, and that you ought to know: 
So, if you want a 
song again, don't try it on with Joe! 
Oh! dear, no, not! &e.

And always go home straight, and tell

I'LL TELL YOUR WIFE.—(coNcLuDED) 
Last week my little wife and I 
Went for a 
country walk, 
And when we reached a 
pleasant nook, 
We sat down for a 
talk. 
My arms around her waist, I 
spoke 
About our wedded life. 
I 
turned and saw a 
gaping crowd, 
Who yelled—" I'll tell your wife !" 
I'll tell your wife, &o. 
I 
hear it in the noisy street, 
And in the quiet square, 
I 
hear its murmur in the shell, 
In short ' tis everywhere. 
That dreadful cry is killing me, 
It's causing fearful strife. 
What, Mr. Jenkins, did you say ? 
He says, " I'll tell your wife." 
Ill tell your wife, &o. 
HARD TIMES COME AGAIN NO MORE. 
Let us pause in life's pleasure and count its many tears 
While we all sup sorrow with the poor ; 
There's a 
song that wL I 
linger for ever in our ears— 
" 
Oh I 
Hard Times conic again no more." 
CHORUS. 
'Tis the song, the sigh of the weary; 
" 
Hard. Times, Hard Times come again, no more; 
Many days you have lingered around my cabin door, 
Oh, Hard Times come again no more." 
While we seek mirth and music, and„ music light and gay, 
There are frail forms fainting at the door ; 
Though their voices are silent, their pleading looks will say, 
" 
Oh, Hard Times come again no more." 
'Tis tho song, etc. 
There's a 
pale, drooping maiden, who toils her life away, 
With a 
worn heart whose better days are o'er ; 
Though her voice would be merry, ' tis sighing all the day--
" 
Oh, Hard Times come again no more." 
'Tis the song, etc.

jol - ly To be 
up in a bal - loon. 
3 I 
met shooting stars who were bent upon sport, 
But who " shot" in a 
very strange manner I 
thought; 
And one thing beat all by chalks I 
must say, 
That was when I 
got into the Milky Way; 
I 
counted the stars, till at last I 
thought, 
I'd found out how much they were worth by the quart, 
An unpolite "Aerolite" who ran 'gainst ray car, 
Wouldn't give "e'er a 
light," to light my cigar. Whilst up, dm 
4- Next a 
comet went by 'midst fire like hail, 
To give me a 
lift, I 
seized hold of his tail, 
To where he was going I 
didn't enquire, 
We'd gone past the moon, till we couldn't get higher; 
Yes, we'd got to the furthermost! 
don't think I 
joke, 
When somehow I 
felt a 
great shecic-I awoke! 
When instead of balloon, moon and planets, I 
saw, 
I'd tumbled from off of my bed to the floor. 
Iritorus.-And there was no balloon,-7-
there was no balloon, 
There were not any planets, and there wasn't any moon, 
So never sup too heavy, or by jingo very soon, 
You're like to fancy you are going up in a 
balloon.

When the ship got sight of Loew's bridge, 
An angry storm arose ; 
At first the wind it got to words, 
And then it got to blows,

He thought of the land where he was born,

The gallant Captain rush'd on deck 
With frenzy in one eye 
Cried lie—" etand by the main jib-Loom I

The noble crew stood by some time, 
'Twits useless—it was vain, 
The storm rag'd wi d--poor William dropp'd 
A tear to Susan Jane. 
Sobbing. --Fare ye well my Susan dear, 
I

Oh ! my heart's in a 
commotion, 
I'm ageing across the ocean, 
Where the winds and waters roar. 
Will rush'd below unto his trunk, 
And opened wide the lid---
Then kiss'd his Susan's pertrait twice, 
Ho tiss'd it twice, he did 
The Captain hailed a 
ferry- boat 
For as istance---ail in vain ; 
For the ship went down with crew and Will, 
Who lov'd fair Susan Jane. 
Gurg!ing.---Fare ye well, fite. 
When the the news was broke to Susan, 
How her William had been drown'd, 
She rokt, 
cut all over in fainting fits, 
Her anguish knew no bound, 
Said she---' with son ow I'll go mad 
Or else 
go insane l 
For I 
did so lo ve my William, and 
He

And on parting he said: 
Fare ye well, tece.

For the loss of her Will Jo! es,

Oh! I'm lonely to-night, love, without you, 
And I 
sigh for one glance of ycur eye; 
For, sure there's a 
charm love, about you, 
Whenever I 
know you are nigh. 
Like the beam of the star when 'tis smiling, 
Is the glance which your eye can't conceal, 
And your voice is so sweet and beguiling, 
That I 
love you, sweet Norah 
CHORUS. 
Oh! don't think that ever I'll doubt you, 
My love I 
will never conceal; 
Oh! I'm lonely to-night, love, without you, 
My darling, sweet Norah O'Neal I 
Oh! the nightingale sings in the wild-wood, 
As if every note that he knew 
Was learned from your sweet voice in childhood, 
To remind me, sweet Norah, of you 
But I 
think, love, so often about you, 
And you don't know how happy I 
feel, 
But I'm lonely to-night, love, without you, 
My darling sweet Norah O'Neal! 
Oh! don't think that ever; c
r
A5 
Oh! why should I 
weep tears of sorrow ? 
Or why to let hope lose its place ? 
Wont I 
meet you, my darling, to-morrow, 
And smile on your beautiful face ? 
Will you meet me ? 
Oh! say, will you meet m( 
With a 
kiss at the foot of the lane ? 
And I'll .promise whenever you greet me, 
That I'll never be lonely again. 
Oh don't think that aver, &e, 
3YCEET ME IN THE LANE. 
Composed by CHARLES BLANIPHIN. 
I'll meet thee in the lane, 
When the clock strikes Nine, 
In ecs'-acy again, love, 
To call thee mine. 
My heart for thee is burning, 
My brain is almost whirling. 
Thro' loving thee so madly, 
My sweet Mountain Rose: 
When evening stars are peeping, 
Oh! then will be our meeting, 
Old time too swiftly fleeting 
Our happy time away. 
I'll meet thee in the lane, 
When the clock strikes nine, 
In ecstacy again, love, 
To call thee mine. 
My heart for thee is burning, 
My brain is almost whirling, 
Thro' loving thee so madly, 
My sweet Mountain Rose.

In ecstacy again, love, 
To call thee mine, 
My heart for thee is burning, 
My brain is almost whirling, 
Thro' loving thee so madly, 
My sweet Mountain Rose. 
I'll leave thee in the lane, 
When the clock strikes Ten, 
And faithful will remain, love, 
Believe me then: 
Deceive thee! I 
will never. 
And breath from me must sever, 
If I 
forget thee ever,

Thy presence care dispelling,

COME, HASTE TO THE WEDDING. 
Come, haste to the wedding, ye friends and ye neighbors., 
The lovers their bliss can no longer delay; 
Fore-et all your sorrows, your care, and your labors, 
And. let every heart beat with rapture to-day; 
Ye votaries all, attend to my call, 
Come, revel in pleasures that never can cloy, 
CiioRus—Cone, see rural felicity, 
Which love and innocence ever enjoy. 
Let envy, let pride, let hate and ambition 
Still crowd to and beat at the breast of the great: 
To such wretched passions we give no admission, 
But leave them alone to the wise ones of state. 
We boast of no wealth, but contentment and health, 
In mirth and in friendship, our moments employ. 
Come, see rural felicity, &e. 
• 
With reason we taste of each heart-stirring pleasure, 
With reason we drink of the full flowin ,, bowl; 
Are jocund and gay, but all within measure, 
For fatal excess will enslave the free soul. 
Then come at our bidding, to this happy wedding, 
No care shall intrude our bliss to annoy. 
Come, see rural felicity, &e.
