Focus and Scope of the Report
  
The Pella, Iowa project centered not upon a single school
 
per Se, but rather upon the varied attempts of a community with a strong
 
ethnic heritage to transmit cultural values and practices to its younger
 
members.
 Case studies and assessments are based upon observation of
 
programs which took place both within and outside formal educational
 
settings.  In considering the activities of the community's public and
 
parochial schools, we have attempted to focus upon a sampling of programs
 
which clearly go beyond the mandated curricula.
 
Evolution of Community Attitudes toward being Dutch-Americans
 
Pella was founded in 1847 by a group of religious separatists
 
from the Netherlands, under the leadership of the charismatic Rev. H. P.
 
Scholte.  In addition to being a minister, Scholte gained prominence in
 
the early community as an entrepreneur, publisher, educator and politician.
 
Had his foreign birth not disqualified him for the position, Scholte would
 
have been Lincoln's choice for an ambassadorial post in Austria.
 The
 
well-nigh palatial home of Rev. Scholte still stands in impressive grandeur
 
on the north side of the town square; its interior and contents have enjoyed
 
painstaking curatorial care under Mrs •  Martha Lauteribach, who is justly
 
regarded as the most knowledgeable member of the community in matters of
 
local history.
 A reconstruction of Scholte's church, with original bap-
tismal font and pulpit, stands on the edge of Pella's Historical Village,
 
where homes and stores of the early period house the artifacts and memora-
bilia of the community's founders, and provide the setting for a number of
 
cultural activities to be discussed below.  Several of Scholte's descendants
 
have achieved a prominence of their own in the town's civic, educational and
 
social circles.
 
-2-
From the beginning, Scholte fostered the acculturation of his
 
followers to the new setting in which they found themselves.  One story
 
frequently heard in Pella (whose historical veracity has been questioned,
 
but which, even if apocryphal, gives a valuable indicator of what is con-
sidered plausible for the period and person in question) tells of attempt
 
by Scholte to gain permission for his followers to be allowed to recite the
 
Pledge of Allegiance in Dutch so that no time would be lost in the process
 
of gaining American Citizenship.
 A prolific writer, Scholte signed many
 
of the publications produced in the new homeland with such by-lines as
 
"A Citizen."  Pella received its name from the Near Eastern town which
 
provided early Christians with a haven of security from persecution, and
 
is often referred to in both formal and informal settings as "The City of
 
Refuge" (most recently in the title of a documentary film about the town's
 
considerable Asian immigrant population).  One needs to be careful to note,
 
however, that Pella may have been a city of refuge to Scholte and his followers,
 
but it was by no means a center of encapsulated isolation from the new home-
land.  Throughout most of its history, Pella has shown remarkably little
 
of the sentimental longing for the fatherland which pervades so many ethnic
 
communities in this country.
 
Any feelings that Holland had definitely  been left on the other
 
side of the ocean were enforced by a series of events early in this century.
 
While Iowa was relatively slow in enacting legislation to ban the use of
 
foreign languages during World War I. it more than compensated for its
 
slow start by approving what is generally regarded as one of the most severe
 
laws in the country.  Virtually any use of a language other than English
 
in any context which could be adjudged to be public constituted a crime.
 
Older members of the community recount with visible emotion the experience
 
of having been in church on Sunday when an inspector would appear, unannounced,
 
to check on compliance with the law.
 In short, it was dangerous to be Dutch.
 
S
 
It was also er
nbarass.ng to be Dutcri
 aves o  immigrants ar-
rived around the time of World War I, and these qroentjes (
1greert
hornstt)
 
are remembered primarily for their persistence in wearing outlandish cos-
tumes (e.g .,  baggy pants), for an overwhelmingly rural orientation (whereas
 
Pella was firmly established as a town and commercial center), and for a
 
(real or imagined) opportunism which was perceived as detrimental to the
 
spirit of communal interdependence which continues to characterize the town.
 
Still other problems arrived with the influx of immigrants during the era of the
 
Depression, and after World War II.
 
In each instance, an assured understanding
 
of proper Dutch values and attitudes by the members of a relatively homo-
geneous community
 was
 challenged by the values and attitudes of real, live
 
Dutchmen from the fatherland, and in each instance the result was a certain
 
defensiveness on the part of the local Dutch-Americans, and a subsequent
 
disinclination to embrace the culture of the fatherland with anything ap-
proaching unbounded enthusiasm.
 
Impact of Community Attitudes on Ethnic Heritage Programs  
The pervasiveness of such attitudes toward the culture of the
 
Low Countries only begins to abate with consistency in the generation of
 
persons now in their early forties •
 As a result, those who have undertaken
 
programs in ethnic heritage education have, until recently at least, had to
 
face the dilemma of needing to choose between the transmission of Dutch
 
culture (though it may be imported, at times even intrusive, and frequently
 
foreign to the local experience), and the perpetuation of Dutch-American
 
values and practices (which often enough strike the native of the Netherlands
 
as quaint, antiquated, or even bizarre).
 
This point may be illustrated by two items commonly associated
 
with ethnic groups, dear to the heart of Pella' s residents, and included in
 
at least some of the programs studied here: food and music.
 
-4-
The typical childhood diet of Pella's older residents did not
 
admit of great variety, and might consist of bread dipped in melted lard
 
and sorghum molasses for breakfast, potatoes, meat and red cabbage for the
 
main noon dinner, and an evening lunch of leftovers, perhaps with butter-
milk porridge and molasses cake.  Festivities such as Thanksgiving might
 
provide the occasion for Jan-in-de-pan (pancakes).
 Such a diet was
 
dictated as much by local conditions as by any Dutch culinary traditions,
 
and even the bologna which has made Pella famous in central Iowa was in-
troduced by a German who once lived in the town.  This does not mean that
 
typically Dutch foods are rejected by Pella 'S residents •
 On the contrary,
 
two bakeries with many Dutch specialties do a healthy business, and no
 
festival is complete without a concession stand to sell poffertjes or
 
Oliebollen (varieties of fried baked goods).  As Mrs. Harriet Zyistra
 
stated in her interview, there is a certain status accorded to the housewife
 
who can prepare an authentic Dutch meal •
 As enthusiastically as such meals
 
may be received, however, they do not necessarily replicate the cuisine of
 
grandmother '
s kitchen, and the young person who acquires the recipe for a
 
typically Dutch dish may well provide grandmother with a few surprises.
 
Pella has always been a community supportive of musical activities.
 
Rev. Scholte' S wife was a conservatory-trained vocalist, and for some time
 
the town supported an opera-house.  After the Civil War, the town was the
 
home of the renowned Light Infantry  Band.  To the present day, the public
 
and private schools offer superior musical programs, and the town abounds
 
in musicians of all sorts, many of whom participate in the annual series of
 
summer concerts,  or play for the college-community orchestra. More than a dozen
 
Dutch hymns and folk-songs are heard from the carillons located at the Tulip
 
Tower and on the Central College campus •
 For those older members of the
 
community, however, whose main musical experience in any sort of Dutch con-
4

text was t
he singing of the Dutch psalter (
until relatively recently, the
 
S
 
S
 
only form of hymnody permitted in the Christian Reformed Church), it comes
 
as a surprise--albeit perhaps a pleasant on e
--to learn that the melody of
 
our Thanksgiving song "We Gather Together" is actually that of a Dutch hymn,
 
or that the pleasant little tunes coming from the carillon, the street-organ
 
used during the summer kermis (carnival), and the Dutch Family Singers and
 
Dancers who stroll the streets at Tulip Time are indeed genuine Dutch music.
 
More often than not, it is the import which wins out over local
 
tradition.
 The summer kermis and December Sinterklaas festivity (during
 
which the good Saint Nicholas arrives in Pella on horseback, accompanied by
 
appropriately clad attendants, and meets out the year's just deserts to the
 
children of the community in accordance with ancient and prescribed practice)
 
were instituted only in recent years, but have firmly established themselves
 
as permanent items on the town's calendar.
 These celebrations have no
 
antecedent in local tradition, and in fact--as several journalists from the
 
Netherlands have pointed out--are not only more typically Dutch than the
 
much-touted  Tulip Time, but indeed  may be celebrated here with a greater eye
 
toward older Dutch traditions than most of what one might experience in
 
the Netherlands!
 
Cther examples of typically Dutch features which have firmly
 
established themselves in the community are the program of Dutch fronts
 
(authenticated facades required of all new or renovated buildings in the comrner-
cial district) and a zeal for authentication of Dutch costume designs which,
 
according to informants such as Emma Lou Heusinkveld and Harriet Zylstra,
 
goes far beyond anything witnessed in previous decades •
 The reasons for the
 
popularity of such "imported" Dutch cultural features are several: at the
 
crassest level, they appeal to popular clich4s of life in the Netherlands;
 
they are accessible to interested parties, whereas much of the local tra-
-6-
dition is not (it is only this year that the author of this report began col-
lecting, under a grant from the Iowa Humanities Board and the National En-
dowment for the Humanities, such frequently-unrecorded data as the proverbs,
 
superstitions, recreational habits and culinary practices recollected by the
 
town's oldest citizens); finally, there appears to be an uneasy realization
 
by the generation of persons now in their prime that the "good old days" out
 
of which local Dutch-American tradition grew may not in all instances merit
 
uncritical acceptance and perpetuation as such.
 
Hence, I can understand, but not entirely concur with, occasional
 
expressions of disappointment that one cannot find more typically Dutch art or
 
craft activity in Pella (though some forms, such as panel painting and lace-
work, have enjoyed a phenomenal resurgence of popularity), that there is not
 
a greater use of specialty foods, or that more homes do not exhibit identi-
fiably Dutch interiors and decorative schemes (a situation which has been
 
reversed in a number of instances).  For better or for worse, such is simply
 
not the side of Dutch culture which Pella has chosen--at least up to recent
 
times--to perpetuate.
 
If the main emphasis is not on the physical culture of the Low
 
Countries, there is certainly no energy spared in efforts to transmit those
 
values, attitudes and behaviors which the community perceives as its Dutch
 
heritage.  On several occasions, I have had my Ethnic Groups class administer
 
the Ethnic Identity Profile, a questionaire which, in effect, asks respondents
 
to indicate the relative "weight" they would assign to such factors as family
 
background, language facility, church affiliation, community involvement, etc.,
 
in determining who is "more or less Dutch" in the eyes of his/her fellow-
townsfolk.
 (A sample of the Profile and its results is being submitted with
 
this report.)  The responses to this questionaire, and especially comments
 
written in the margin or shared with the investigator, and current interviews
 
with such persons as Mrs. Heusinkveld and the two principals, Mr. Groothuis
 
S
 
S
 
-7-
and Mr. Vander Leest, make it clear that the espousal of these values emits
 
as clear a signal as the display of any physical object that one has enfran-
chised himself as a member of the community.
 One is frequently reminded (as
 
we were on the evening of our arrival in town) that an "American" who embraces
 
such values enjoys greater acceptance and mobility in the community than
 
someone  "from a Dutch family" who does not.
 
In great part, these values are associated with, or at least re-
inforced, by Pella's preponderantly Calvinistic persuasion.
 (About two thirds
 
of the town' s churches, and probably a greater percentage of church-goers,
 
are aff i
liated with some  branch of the Reformed movement.)  This fact is
 
ref
 I
 ec ed in a ruggedly staunch 5abbatarianism which is not only accepted,
 
but Indeed willingly fostered, by a visible majority of Pe i
la's residents.
 
On one occasion when I flagged in my zeal to complete all of my yardwork by
 
Saturday evening, I was lovingly but rather firmly reminded by a neighbor
 
that this was not just another day of the week, but de grote voorzondag,
 
'
the great pre-Sunday [period of preparation for Sabbath rest].'
 
Also highly prized is an incredible attention to fiscal detail.
 
Ct ten r
nistaken for avarice, this actually reflects, as noted by Mrs •  Heusinkveld
 
and others, a compelling need to be in control of those things which have
 
been entrusted to us, and by  which we shape, at least in part, our own
 
destinies. At the bottom line, the attitude is one of responsible (Christian)
 
stewardship, and is reflected in a number of other behaviors common in the
 
community, such as the housewife's seemingly excessive attention to cleanli-
ness.
 (Sweeping, dusting and window-washing several times during the week,
 
whether seemingly necessary or not, is by no means uncommon.)
 
Related to the concept of stewardship is a sense of communal inter-
dependence.  As pointed out by Mr. Gosselink, a member of the town's citizenry
 
:
1l simply not be allowed to founder, and all should be assured of unflinching
 
i
, should disaster come to an indLvidual
 or family.  A visible example of
 
-8-
responsibility accepted is the local hospital, built and expanded primarily
 
through solicitation of local funds (which, unlike monies from governmental
 
or similar sources, would not obligate the hospital board to answer to anyone
 
except members of the local community).  In the same context, it is noteworthy
 
that several informants (Mr. Gosselink, Mr. Kooi) chose to cite teamwork as
 
a main benefit of Tulip Time, rather than a great opportunity for "displaying
 
ones wares" or for commercial opportunism.  Finally, it might be noted that
 
what is often mistaken for nosyness on the part of the townsfolk may actually be
 
an expression of concern about ones welfare, and an affirmation of the fact
 
that help would be available if needed.
 
For all of these values, family life is considered the appropriate
 
and proper model, and it is no coincidence that school administrators and
 
teachers interviewed report well-nigh incredible levels of parental support.
 
Hence, it comes as no surprise that, in the transmission of such values (which
 
to the residents of Pella, are indeed indicators of ones "Dutchness"), the
 
community's institutions, including its schools, have been r e
markably successful.
 
An Overview of Pella's Schools
  
The Pella Community Schools had a total enrollment during the
 
1981-82 school year of just under 1600 pupils; the Pella Christian Schools,
 
which also offer ,
 programs from kindergarten through high school, had a total
 
enrollment of about 700 pupils.
 (Pella's total population is approximately
 
8,000.)
 Although the Christian Schools resist the label of "Christian Reformed
 
Schools," the fact of the matter is that the question of Christian education was
 
one of the main issues leading to the split between the Reformed Church in
 
America and the Christian Reformed Church, and furthermore, that most Christian
 
Reformed family do try to send their children to the Christian Schools, and
 
that the majority of pupils in that system are from families associated with
 
the Christian Reformed Church.  Mrs. Kooi is probably correct in pointing out
 
that the greater visibility which the Christian Schools seem at times to
 
enjoy in the area of heritage education may be due as much to the homogeneity
 
of the pupils' ethnic and religious background, as to any particular efforts
 
on the part of teachers or administrators.  Mr. Groothuis, principal of the
 
Pella Christian Grade School, is quick to admit that his job is made consider-
ably easier by the commonality of experiences and goals of his pupils' parents.
 
For this report, I have chosen to highlight one program of the Pella
 
Community Schools system (a heritage-awareness unit), an offering of the
 
Christian Schools (the Dutch language), and parallel programs (in music) of
 
the two systems.  In addition, I have prepared an overview of opportunities
 
for the study of language, folklore and music which are offered outside formal
 
school settings.
 
The Path oC De_
` 5t: A Case Stuav in Historical Fiction vs. Fictitious History
  
Mrs. Muriel Kooi teaches fourth grade at Webster School, in Pella.
 
She is a person whose many talents and awesome energy have won respect through-
out the community.  An active member of the Pella Historical Society, she now
 
sits on that group's board, and has accepted. various committee assignments.
 
Demonstrating the zeal of one who has made the community her own by choice,
 
rather than by birth, she has actively promoted some of Pella's most successful
 
ethnic-heritage programs •
 She was responsible in great measure for instigating
 
the celebration of Pella's highly successful Sinterklaas festivity.
 
Perhaps most important of all, she has been supportive of colleagues
 
in their efforts.  An example of this is her outspoken support of work by Mrs.
 
Jeanine Van Vark, whose reading group made an important first step toward
 
a goal expressed by  a number of informants (Mr. Vander Leest, Mrs. Bruminel, and
 
others): greater direct contact between the pupils in the schools and the
 
community' s senior citizens •
 Activities such as Mrs •  Van Vark '
s program
 
on Pella's history, accompanied by a selection of songs in Dutch and English,
 
presented to residents of Fair Haven (a prominent local retirement center),
 
-10-
is seen by many as the sort of preliminary contact needed to facilitate
 
greater involvement of our older citizens, perhaps as occasional classroom
 
resource persons.
 
In addition to her many other activities, Mrs •  Kooi is a prolific
 
author.  One of her most successful series of articles, for The Io
n, featured
 
a number of Pella's architectural landmarks •
 Her most widely read work, how-
ever, and the basis for her heritage-awareness unit, is The Path of Delft,) a
 
work of historical fiction whose title refers to one of the best-known incidents
 
in Pella's early history.  Rev. Scholte's refined and cultured wife was--to
 
put it mildly-- taken a bit aback by the primitive conditions which she en-
countered upon arriving in (what was to become) Pella.  Opening the chest
 
which contained her precious Delftware, she discovered that the dishes, like
 
so many of her expectations, had been irretrievably broken.  The pieces,
 
however, were saved and used to pave a pathway through the formal gardens
 
of her new home •
 Some years ago, pieces of the pathway were discovered by
 
workers on the highway which runs past the Scholte House.  The possible
 
metaphoric meanings of the pathway have by no means escaped the attention of
 
Pella's citizenry.
 
Not far into the new calendar year, Mrs •  Kooi begins a series of
 
readings and discussions of The Path of Delft. Attention to things Dutch will
 
already have been aroused not only by Mrs. Kooi's own enthusiasm, but also
 
by previous units such as the production of Hans Brinker. Perhaps most exciting
 
for the pupils, however, is the series of up to a half dozen walking tours,
 
during which the children are invited to make the experiences of the book their
 
own.  The exact itinerary may vary from year to year, but typically includes:
 
a retracing of the final leg of the immigrants' trek to Pella; a tour of Pella' s
 
shoe-windows, which display early Dutch and American realia prior to Tulip T
i
m
E S
 
a visit to the local graveyard, which includes a remarkably successful unit on
 
culling historical and cultural data from the gravestones; a trip through Pella's
 
S
 
-
.11-
Historical Village (to learn, as Mrs. Kooi put it, that there is more there
 
than just the boyhood home of Wyatt Earp); a tour of the Scholte House.
 
During her interview, Mrs •  Kooi confirmed what I had already gathere
 
from casual conversations with her pupils: the schoolchildren are far more
 
interested in history than fiction, and that historical fiction (i.e., a
 
plausible retelling of what may well have taken place), is much preferred over
 
fictitious history (a series of platitudes and cliches about the founding
 
fathers which, with little or no change, could serve as the presumed common
 
historical background for the members of virtually any ethnic group founded
 
by immigrants).
 This preference for historical perspectives is perhaps the
 
best indicator I have for the success of Mrs. Kooi's work.
 
When I asked pupils what they liked about the Path of Delft unit,
 
responses were remarkably uniform: the material is local, tangible, theirs to
 
share in whether they are Dutch-American or not, not distant or foreign.
 
This does not mean, however, that Mrs. Kooi is more interested in promoting
 
the "local" understanding of Dutch culture, rather than the "imported" version.
 
As stated in her interview, she is staunchly in favor of an infusion of Dutch
 
culture into all programs, across the curricula •
 At the moment that this
 
report is being written, Mrs. Kooi is in the Netherlands, collecting material
 
(and very contemporary and distinctly Dutch, rather than Dutch-American,
 
material at that) which will allow her  to implement her plans. I sense, however,
 
that there may be a lesson to be learned here, and one that might easily be
 
overlooked.
 Mrs. Kooi began with the local tradition, invited all of her
 
pupils to share in it (including her Asian pupils, who are frequently asked to
 
compare their acculturation experiences to those of Pella's founders), and
 
has then invited the pupils to learn about Dutch culture from a broader per-
spective.  Obviously, the opposite is also possible, and by no means an approach
 
ignored by the instructor (Hans Brinker precedes The Path of Delft). In very
 
-12-
general terms, however, I receive the impression that it is more feasible
 
in more instances to work from the local tradition into a broader under-
standing of Dutch culture than vice versa; such will, at any rate, almost
 
certainly be the case as an ever-greater segment of the panorama of Dutch
 
culture makes its appearance in Pella and becomes a part of the local ex-
perience.
 It would be ideal, of course, to achieve a synergism of "local"
 
and "imported" forces.
 
Music Makes the Difference I
  
As Mr. Vander Leest points out in his Master's thesis, Influence
  
of the Holland Background on Education in the Pella Community Schools, 1847-
1966, the music programs enjoy a long tradition of transmitting and enforcing
 
an awareness of Dutch culture in Pella •
 In great part, this is due to the
 
efforts of Miss Anne Tysseling, who took full advantage of the community's
 
background and opportunities provided by festivals such as Tulip Time. Miss
 
Tysseling's resource materials have been passed on to  Mrs. Ruth Brummel,
 
who has amassed an enviable library of musical and cultural literature of
 
her own.  In both the Community and Christian Schools, music can boast an
 
enviable role in heritage education: the entire year's program is infused with
 
appropriate Dutch material, and that in a manner which clearly shows initiative
 
on the instructor's part which goes beyond any mandated requirements; an
 
astonishing passive (and even at times active) knowledge of the language is
 
transmitted to the students, with the result that the music programs may be
 
the unrecognized linchpin in efforts to revitalize language instruction in
 
the community; the instructors themselves are remarkably versatile, and can
 
use the classroom (as observed in preparing this report) for instruction in
 
Dutch geography, history and culture.
 
Mrs. Ruth Brummel has, in her quiet way, put into practice much
 
of what others preach.
 A former pupil of Jos Wuytack (a major figure in
 
S
 
Dutch children's music), she has also made a formal study of the Dutch
 
language, has traveled to the Netherlands, where she gathered both general
 
cultural material and a very full collection of children's musical litera-
ture, and has actively promoted ever-greater participation by the children
 
of the Community Schools in festivals such as Sinterklaas and Tulip Time.
 
She is also an outspoken proponent of greater interaction between her pupils
 
and the community's older Dutch-American citizens.
 
During the school year, there is a steady flow of Dutch music in
 
the curriculum.  Thanksgiving and the season of the fall festival (a separate
 
event in Pella) give opportunity for learning Wilt heden nu treden (the
 
original of "We Gather Together") and various doxologica]. literature.
 
Christmas is marked by both secular and sacred songs.  Spring brings its
 
own genre of folksongs, and a birthday may well be marked by singing the
 
Dutch Lang zullen ze leven. There are children's dances, songs with motions,
 
and a sampling of international favorites (such as Broeder Jacob, or Fr re
 
Jacques) which also enjoy a popularity with Dutch children.  The musical
 
selection may be as sweet as the lullaby Slaap J
dnde slaap, or as sober as a
 
selection from the  Dutch Psalter.  A role model in all that she asks her
 
children to do, Mrs •  Brumxnel also performs, and her participation in recorder
 
duets from the Psalter offers palpable inspiration to her pupils.
 
Mr. Kooi, music teacher at Pella Christian Grade School, is also
 
a person of many talents.  In his "spare" time, he serves as the music direc-
tor of a large Christian Reformed congregation, directs choral and bell-choir
 
groups, and plays accordion for the Dutch Family Singers and Dancers.  On
 
the basis of classroom observation, I would have to conclude that he puts
 
equal energy into an open and frank statement of his Christian principles,
 
and in fact may well see himself as much in the role of a spokesman for the
 
faith as in that of a music instructor.  In terms of the school's goals, as
 
outlined by his principal, Mr. Groothuis, Mr. Kooi is probably just the
 
-14-
sort of person who is needed in his position: a teacher of unquestioned
 
credentials and talents; a member of the community who is sensitive to
 
the currents of feeling running through it; an outspoken Christian in the
 
Reformed tradition; that notwithstanding, an open-minded innovator.
 
The l
ist of year-long program features offered in Mr. Kcoi's
 
classes would, in great part, duplicate that given above for Mrs. Br munel's
 
classes.
 One difference, however, is worth dwelling upon.  This difference,
 
it might be noted, does not represent any real divergence in the two in-
structors' outlooks, but rather in the areas which they chose to emphasize
 
during my talks with them.
 
A number of informants (inter al •, such older members of the com-
munity as Mrs. Schiebout, Sr.) have expressed the idea that one of Pella's
 
traditions which ought under no circumstances be allowed to founder is that
 
of Dutch Psalm singing.  Mr. Kooi, who is active in revitalizing this tra-
dition (and who has enjoyed some success in stirring up interest among his
 
pupils), is seen by a number of persons in the community as just the sort
 
of influential leadership figure required for a more-than-pro-forma perpetu-
ation of Psalm singing.  As I shall point out below, in the section on language
 
learning, the real reason for language instruction is often not the acquisi-
tion of fluency, but rather an approach to the affective and experiential
 
domain of the older speakers (as Mrs.  Zyistra  said, to share in the (ex-
pression of the) perspectives and feelings of those who have transmitted
 
the heritage to us).
 In this context, I find it significant that Mr. Kooi
 
found language instruction valuable in helping one to understand his cul-
tural origins, or to understand others; the complete range of human emotion,
 
however (and hence, by contextual implication of Mr. Kooi's statement, the
 
key to understanding ourselves), is expressed in the Dutch Psalter.  In effect,
 
Mr. Kool has touched upon a fundamental issue in heritage education: the
 
S

need to assure some sense of continuity between the constellation of
 
emotional forces which sustained the older generation, and that which
 
will motivate the up-coming generation.
 
Language Instruction
  
One frequently hears statements to the effect that Pella is
 
down to her last 100 speakers of Dutch, and these are going fasts
 It is
 
true  that the primary speaker-population has now reached retirement age •  I
 
have  engaged in free socialization in Dutch, however, with persons (n.b.,
 
not from the families of immigrants) who are as young as 30
-
 35 •
 This
 
situation is admittedly a rare one, and I find it about the age-range of
 
50- 55 which begins to offer an appreciable  pool of speakers.  As I have
 
pointed out in some of my sociolinguistic studies, it is not so much the
 
speaker of Dutch which is  dying out, as is the sort of social situation
 
which demanded its use.
 
It would be difficult to estimate the exact number of speakers,
 
though if we are indeed
 
or polled more speakers
 
Rather, such statements
 
down to our last 100, then I have observed, recorded
 
in my own research than are supposed to be available.
 
are to be seen as one reflection of the community's
 
attitude toward the Dutch language.  The Dutch spoken in Pella has a number
 
of non-standard forms of which its speakers are acutely aware.  In addition,
 
the hybrid forms of the language which are in current use by teenagers
 
(Yankee Dutch) would not necessarily be intelligible to a person versed only
 
in the standard language.  There is probably no  area  of Dutch culture in
 
which the difference between the "local" and the "imported" version is
 
sensed as strongly as in the linguistic arena.
 It is policy de rigeur
 
for a speaker approached by an investigator to delineate the difference
 
between "High Dutch," deftiq or qoed Ho f
lands (
'good Dutch') on the one
 
hand, and "Low Dutch," "Pella Dutch" or "Household Dutch" on the other, and
 
then (if one has not formally studied the language) to disclaim the status
 
-16-
of a speaker.
 In one instance, a member of the community denied almost
 
categorically any knowledge of the language, only later (admittedly, after
 
a certain "thawing out,
, period) to give a taped interview, with questions
 
and answers almost entirely in Dutch.
 
Two examples of non-standard forms might be given; both have, in-
cidentally, been recorded among similar speaker-populations.  One evening
 
in my Dutch class at Central College a review of the Dutch verb zi n '
to be'
 
(which is at least as irregular as its English equivalent in the array of
 
present-tense forms) prompted a class member who is a prominent Pella resident,
 
and quite clearly a person for whom Dutch was a household language to raise
 
his hand and question the accuracy of my forms •
 He then gave the forms heard
 
so frequently in Pella, which are perfectly regular, and based upon only one
 
of the three stems used in the standard Dutch paradigm of the verb.  Another
 
hybrid form is spraten '
to talk.'  Some see it as a blend of the synonyms
 
spreken and praten; I have heard the incorrect syllabic division Holland
  
spraten for Hollands praten '
to speak Dutch' so often that I prefer the latter as
 
an explanation for the genesis of spraten. 
At any rate, there is an unmistakable reticence exhibited by Pella's
 
speakers of Dutch •
 For reasons alluded to above and for still other reasons
 
too numerous to treat here, there is a long-standing aversion toward use of
 
the language in the presence of "Americans," whose language is that of the
 
dominant culture; there is an even greater hesitancy to use the language with
 
any speaker of Dutch who might cast disparagement upon the local idiom of
 
a speaker.  Ironically, it is precisely the presence  and abundance of non-
standard forms in Pella Dutch which causes many speakers to despair of any
 
hopes for the language's survival, and consequently to hasten its untimely
 
demise through disuse, when, quite the contrary, the fact that such hybrid
 
forms can evolve shows the linguist (who recognizes change as a universal of
 
livinq languages) that Pella Dutch still exhibits the potential for vitality.

Several attempts have, in fact, been made to resuscitate Dutch
 
in Pella.  In the
 
family approached
 
suaded him of the
 
happened to be in
 
to her retirement
 
mid-1950's, one of the members of an unusually prominent
 
the superintendent of the Community Schools, and per-
desirability of a Dutch program.
 The parent's son
 
the class of Miss Dena Versteeg, a teacher who, prior
 
in the early 1970's, dedicated over forty  years of her
 
life to public instruction; in addition to being a beloved and respected
 
teacher, Miss Versteeg was--and continues to be--regarded as a precious
 
human resource in our ccnmu
.inity for information on the local Dutch tradition.
 
She is also fluent in Dutch, and a person who evidently approached the in-
struction of the language with a strong sense of concern for detail and
 
correctness •
 I have had casual conversations with several persons who
 
were involved with the program, and all concur in giving it high marks,
 
at least from the pupils' point of view.  From the administrator's point of
 
view, things were evidently less rosy.  Scheduling adjustments needed to be
 
made, especially for pupils who had begun as fifth graders and wanted to
 
continue as sixth graders.  At the end of the second year of the Dutch
 
program, the principal intervened and the language was dropped from the
 
curriculum.
 
In 1978, Mrs. Harriet Zylstra, librarian and resources coordinator
 
for the Pella Christian Grade School (which  offers instruction through
 
eighth grade) initiated an enrichment program in Dutch for seventh graders.
 
Classes met twice a week, and used a variety of materials.  Mrs. Zyistra
 
had obtained an instructional-materials grant from the Netherlands Ministry
 
of Science and Education, which provided her with a complete course in Dutch.
 
Although the Dutch materials were designed primarily for the younger children
 
of guest workers in the Netherlands, Mrs. Zyistra adapted them to the needs
 
of her pupils, produced a small handbook of conversational Dutch based on
 
the everyday experiences of a traveler in the Netherlands, read from the
 
-18-
New Testament in Today's Dutch (Groot Nieuws voor U), held memorization
 
contests based on a locally produced and recently reprinted volume of
 
Dutch Nursery Rhymes, and topped off the year with a Dutch meal, at which
 
occasion one had to speak Dutch in order to be served.
 
It is worth noting that Mrs. Zyistra combined an appreciation
 
for formal correctness in language instruction with a sensitivity to the
 
potential of language as a transmitter of cultural values.  Two point
 
brought up in her interview might be cited to illustrate her views in
 
this regard.  On the one hand, her "wish list" (as well as that of her
 
principal) would include the identificatjon
and, if necessary, perhaps
 
even production--of a rigorous, challenging grammar suited to the needs of
 
an American seventh grader, and geared toward helping the pupil in both
 
languages.  On the other hand, her real goal in  teaching Dutch lies not
 
so much in facilitating fluency, but rather in facilitating the participa-
tion of her pupils in the affective domain of their cultural forebeàrers,
 
i.e., to "feel" like a Dutchman, and to be able to share those feelings
 
in the one language which has proven itself capable of transmitting just
 
such  feelings.
 
(As an aside, one might mention the fact that "Yankee Dutch"
 
--which is alive and doing very well, thank you, in the Pella Community
 
and Christian Schools--consists primarily of English syntax and grammar
 
with Dutch vocabulary; the overwhelming majority of "Yankee Dutch" terms
 
express feelings or social activities for which English has no single
 
term. Some examples are: suf 'dull, lethargic, unable to get moving';
 
beriauwd '
constricted, stifled, oppressed, anxious'; vies  '
squeexnish,
 
finicky, skittish'; knoelen around 'mess around, make a mess, bungle,
 
botch up'.  No doubt many of her pupils came to Mrs. Zylstra with at least
 
some idea of how it felt to be a Dutchman.)
 
-
.19-
Considering that she did her work without special released
 
time, Mrs. Zyistra certainly deserves the commendation which one hears
 
from former pupils (and parents of the annual dozen or so pupils) associated
 
with the Dutch program.  By 1980, however, it was becoming clear that
 
special scheduling considerations needed to be made, and hence, though the
 
Christian Grade School remains proud as punch of the letters of praise which
 
it received from the Dutch government, the program was dropped at the end
 
of its second year.  I believe that the Christian Grade School principal,
 
Mr. Ivan Groothuis, is sincere in stating that the reintroduction of Dutch
 
would be a priority for any future program revisions; time alone will tell
 
if such is to be the case.
 
Still another program was tried out in the late 1960's with the
 
combined seventh and eighth graders at the Christian School in nearby Peoria,
 
Iowa (a community strongly identified with the Dutch-American territory whose
 
epicenter is Pella).
 Mr. Robert De Jager, a native of the Netherlands and
 
principal-teacher of the seventh/eighth grade class, introduced Dutch, only
 
to find that, in time, parents complained that pupils were putting too much
 
energy into Dutch, at the expense of other subjects, and that some seventh-
grade pupils felt disadvantaged being in the same class with eighth-graders
 
who had studied Dutch the year before.
 Scheduling and feasibility problems
 
became apparent, and, in a now hauntingly familiar pattern, the program was
 
dropped at the end of its second year.
 
Mr. De Jager, however, is both versatile and resiliant.  Upon
 
retirement (and a feature article in the local newspaper on his many-sided
 
career), this educator-broadcaster-musician-preacher-craftsman moved to
 
Pella. Here he could immerse himself even more fully than before in church
 
and
 civic activities, in his weekly Dutch-language radio program, and in a
 
variety of education programs, particularly those of the Christian Opportunity
 
Center (a special-education and sheltered workshop complex near his home).
 
-20-
At the same time, Mr •  De Jager quietly began tutoring Dutch.
 
Without any particular advertisement, he has worked (since autumn, 1981)
 
with six pupils from four families.  Some measure of his success is given
 
by the fact that all of his pupils but one are continuing through the
 
summer, and that two high-school age pupils (one who had dropped out of
 
the program because of a heavy schedule of sports and studies, and another
 
who had been in Mrs. Zyistra's program) have voluntarily reinitiated their
 
study of Dutch under Mr. De Jager. Parents appear to be more than satisfied
 
with the instructor, whose lesson typically includes not only grammar
 
and useful expressions, but also some religious text (a prayer, a verse
 
from the Dutch Psalter, the retelling of a Bible story, or the text of a
 
i
ymn).  The latter point reflects the  point made by Mr. De Jager during his
 
interview; that one of the the most useful aspects of language in his own
 
experience has been the ability which languages have given him to get at the
 
core meaning of Scripture by comparing the way in which the same idea is
 
expressed in several languages.  Although it was said in the context of his
 
ability to relate  well across generational lines, I sense that the concern
 
for the understanding and transmission of religious values was also implied
 
in the statement of one parent that the instructor is  "the sort of person
 
every child should experience at least o n c e. "
 
I recently learned that the editor of the Pella Chronicle (which
 
featured Mr. De Jager on the occasion of his retirement) is contemplating
 
an article on Mr. De Jager' s tutoring sessions.  Perhaps the awareness which
 
such an article would raise in the community will help Mr. De Jager to break
 
the "two-year-curse" on language programs in Pella.
 
The reasons that pupils give for learning Dutch differ little from
 
those given by pupils in similar programs elsewhere: there is a desire
 
to socialize with members of the older generation, to come closer to ones
 
S
 
IRE
 
granddaughters'
 
-22-
therefore be allowed to make the next logical step in affirming its
 
heritage and values.  The point, of course, is not the charming story
 
of the child, but rather the insight which it gives us into community
 
attitudes.
 Among other things, we are dealing with a rite of passage,
 
and the failure to recognize it as such and support it for its underlying
 
value would, as the extreme consequence, mean a deterioration of the ties
 
which contribute to group cohesiveness across generational lines.
 
Assessments and Projections
  
It may well be that the future of heritage and language education
 
-will lie to an ever-greater extent outside of formal school settings.  In
 
addition to private language tutoring, there are several private and public
 
programs which may assume more and more importance.  The Dutch Family
 
Singers and Dancers are a cooperative venture by a number of families  (and
 
individuals)
 who practice Dutch songs and dances
 to be performed
 
at Tulip Time and on various occasions throughout the year.  Most recently,
 
a small contingent performed at the send-off ceremony for three students
 
who had won free trips to the Netherlands in an essay contest sponsored by
 
the Pella Historical Society.  Several years ago, the group traveled to
 
Ames, Iowa, to welcome the (overwhelmed) members of the visiting Amsterdam
 
Concertgebouw Orchestra.  The group has been active for nearly twenty years,
 
and counts among its members senior citizens, children whose parents are
 
not members, but who come with friends whose families are, singles, couples,
 
and entire families.  Practice sessions for the group are the only occasion
 
on which I have observed or experienced  spontaneous socialization in Dutch
 
with persons my age (mid- to late 30's).  While it is not overwhelmingly
 
common, some join the group for the express purpose of exposing their children
 
to other persons who use the Dutch language.  Such was the case, for example,
 
for the family of an active member of the Christian Reformed Church and a
 
S
 
-23-
leader in the Calvin Cadet Core  (Christian Reformed scout program).
 
Though only in his early 30' s, the father of the family is an active
 
speaker of Dutch who consistently greets me in both languages.
 
Shortly after submission of this report, a program will begin
 
at the public library which will, if possible, include a component of
 
Dutch children's lore, nursery rhymes,  sayings in Dutch, and Dutch children's
 
literature in translation.
 I have not been able to confer recently with
 
the persons in charge of the program, but hope to issue an adendum to
 
this report if such is warranted.
 
Finally, it will be interesting to note the progress of still
 
another program of the Pella Historical Society: language class (primarily)
 
for parents.  1982 marks 200 years of official ties between the United
 
States and the Netherlands, and a special college-community  committee,
 
headed by emeritus Prof. Barbara Dieleman, has coordinated a year-long
 
slate of commemorative activities.  This fall, a program is slated for
 
instruction in Dutch.  Though potentially open to all who are not fluent
 
in the language, the course (and, very possibly the tuition schedule, which
 
will be heavily underwritten by the Historical Society) will be designed
 
primarily for young couples.  It is hoped that the opportunity to learn
 
the language will appeal to those who realize with  regret that penance
 
is due for "the linguistic sin" (as it is sometimes termed) of failing
 
to learn the language in the context of family life.  A "fifth column"
 
of dedicated parents would, it is hoped, form a cadre of concerned citizens
 
who would contribute their energies to revitalization of the language in
 
a  broader community context.
 
The idea which holds the most promise is that of instituting
 
a "Board of Dutch Education" in Pella.  It is envisioned that such a
 
group would be influential in the coordination and centralization of
 
efforts such as those described here, and would address itself to matters
 
-24-
of feasibility and follow-through in those instances where an instructor
 
or program director needs energy and/or sheer clout which goes beyond
 
her/his own resources.  The head of such a group would have to be an
 
individual (or governing committee) with considerable credibility and
 
influence, and, above all, the ability to bring together the community's
 
many interests without favor or partiality.  I sincerely wish Pella the
 
realization of such hopes, and that with as little delay as possible.

Focus and Scope of the Report  
The Pella,  Iowa project centered not upon a single school per se,
 
but rather upon the varied attempts of a community with a strong ethnic
 
heritage to transmit cultural values and practices to its younger members.
 
Case studies and assessments are based upon observation of programs taking
 
place both within and outside formal educational settings.
 In considering
 
the activities of the community's public and parochial schools, we have
 
focused upon programs which clearly go beyond the mandated curricula.
 
Evolution of Community Attitudes toward being Dutch-American
  
Pella was founded in 1847 by a group of religious separatists from
 
the Netherlands, under the leadership of the charismatic Rev. H. P
. Scholte.
 
In addition to being a minister,  Scholte gained prominence as an entrepreneur,
 
publisher, educator and politician.
 Had his foreign birth not
 
him for the position,  Scholte would have been Lincoln's choice
 
ambassadorial post in Austria.
 The well-nigh palatial home of
 
disqualified
 
for an
 
Rev. Scholte
 
still stands in impressive grandeur on the north side of the town square;
 
interior and contents have enjoyed painstaking curatorial care under Mrs.
 
Martha Lautenbach,  justly regarded as the community's most knowledgeable
 
member in matters of local history.  A reconstruction of Scholte's church,
 
with original baptismal font and pulpit,  stands on the edge of Pella's
 
E
listorical Village, where homes and stores of the early period house
 
artifacts and memorabilia of the community's founders, and provide the
 
setting for various cultural activities discussed below.
 Several of
 
Scholte's descendants have achieved a prominence of their own in the town's
 
civic, educational and social circles.
 
Pella received its name from the Near Eastern town which provided
 
early Christians with a haven of security from persecution,  and is often
 
WEBBER -2-
referred to,  both formally and informally, as "The City of Refuge" (most
 
recently in the title of a documentary film about the town's considerable
 
Asian immigrant population).  While it may have been a city of refuge for
 
Scholte and his followers, Pella was by no means a center of encapsulated
 
isolation from the world of the new homeland.
 Throughout much of t
ts histo
 
Pella has shown remarkably little of the sentimental longing for the father-
land which pervades so many ethnic communities, and from the beginning,  its
 
leaders have fostered the acculturation of the town's residents to the new
 
setting in which they found themselves.
 One familiar story (whose historical
 
veracity has been questioned, but which, even if apocryphal,  indicates just
 
what is considered plausible for the period and person in question) tells of an
 
attempt by Scholte to gain permission for his followers to recite the Pledge
 
of Allegiance in Dutch,  so that no time would be lost in acquiring American
 
citizenship.
 A prolific writer,  Scholte signed many publications produced in
 
his new homeland with such by-lines as "An Adopted Citizen."
 
The idea that Holland had definitely been left on the other side
 
of the ocean was enforced by events early in this century.
 While Iowa was
 
relatively slow to enact legislation banning the use of foreign languages
 
during World War I
,  it more than compensated for its late start by approving
 
what is generally regarded as one of the most severe laws in the country.
 
Virtually any use of a language other than English,  in contexts which could
 
be considered public, constituted a crime.
 Older members of the community
 
recount with visible emotion the experience of being in church on Sunday when
 
an inspector appeared, unannounced,  to check on compliance with the law.
 
In a word,  it was dangerous to be Dutch.
 
It was also embarrassing to be Dutch!
 Waves of immigrants arrived
 
around the time of World War I
,  and these groentjes (
"greenhorns") are
 
WEBBER -3-
remembered primarily for their persistence in wearing outlandish costilnes
 
(e.g., baggy pants), overwhelmingly rural orientation (whereas Pella was
 
firmly established as a commercial center), and (
real or imagined)
 
opportunism, perceived as detrimental to the town's characteristic spirit of
 
communal interdependence.
 S
till other problems arrived with influxes of
 
immigrants during the Depression,  and after World War II.
 In each instance,
 
a relatively homogeneous community's assured understanding of proper Dutch
 
values and attitudes was challenged by the vaues and attitudes of real,  live
 
Dutchmen from the fatherland, and in each instance the local Dutch-Americans  
exhibited a certain defensiveness, and a subsequent disinclination to embrace
 
the fatherland's culture with anything approaching unbounded enthusiasm.
 
Impact of Community Attitudes on Ethnic Heritage Progr ams  
The pervasiveness of such attitudes toward the culture of the Low
 
Countries only began to abate with consistency in the generation of persons
 
now in their early forties.
 As a result,  those who undertook programs in
 
ethnic heritage education had, at least until recently, to face the dilemma
 
of needing to choose between transmitting Dutch culture (though it may be
 
imported, at times even intrusive,  and frequently foreign to the local
 
experience), and perpetuating Dutch-American values and practices (which
 
often enough strjke a native of the Netherlands as quaint, antiquated, or
 
even bizarre).
 
This point may be illustrated by two items commonly associated with
 
enthic groups,  dear to the heart of Pella's residents, and included in at
 
least some of the programs studied here: food and music.
 
The typical childhood diet of Pella's older residents did not admit
 
of great variety, and might consist of bread dipped in melted lard and
 
sorghum molasses for breakfast,  potatoes, meat and red cabbage for the main
 
WEBBER -4--
noon dinner,  and an evening lunch of leftovers, perhaps with buttermilk
 
porridge and molasses cake.
 Festivities such as Thanksgiving might provide
 
occasion for Jan-in-de-pan (pancakes).
 Such a diet was dictated as much by
 
local conditions as by any Dutch culinary traditions, and even the bologna
 
which has made Pella famous in central Iowa was introduced by a German.
 This
 
does not mean that typically Dutch foods are unfamiliar to Pella's residents.
 
On the contrary, two bakeries with Dutch specialties do a healthy business,
 
and no festival is complete without poffertjes or oliebollen (varieties of
 
fried baked goods).  As Mrs. Zyistra stated in her interview, there is a
 
certain status accorded to housewives who can prepare authentic Dutch meals.
 
As enthusiastically as such meals are received, however,  they do not
 
necessarily replicate the cuisine of grandmother's kitchen,  and the young
 
person who acquires the recipe for a typically Dutch dish may well provide
 
grandmother with a few surprises.
 
Pella has been consistently supportive of musical activities.
 Rev.
 
Scholte's wife was a conservatory-trained vocalist, and for a time the to
wn
 
supported an opera-house.
 After the Civil War,  Pella was the home of the
 
renowned Light Infantry Band.
 To the present day, the public and private
 
schools offer superior musical programs, and the town abounds in musicians o
 
all sorts, many of whom participate in an annual series of summer concerts,
 
or play in the college -community orchestra.
 Dutch hymns and folk-songs are
 
heard from the carillons located at the Tulip Tower,  and on the Central
 
College campus.
 For older members of the community, however, whose main
 
musical experience in a Dutch context was the singing of the Dutch Psalter
 
(until rather recently, the only form of hymnody in the Christian Reformed
 
Church), it comes as a surprise--albeit perhaps a pleasant one--to learn that
 
the melody of our Thanksgiving song "We Gather Together" is actually that of
 
WEBBER -5-
a Dutch hymn,  or that the pleasant little tunes coming from the carillon,  the
 
street-organ used during summer kermis (
carnival), and the Dutch Family
 
Singers and Dancers strolling the streets at Tulip Time are indeed genuine
 
Dutch music.
 
More often than not,  the import wins out over local tradition.
 The
 
summer kerinis and December Sinterklaas festivity (
during which the good Saint
 
Nicholas arrives on horseback, accompanied by appropriately clad attendants,
 
and meets out the year's just deserts to the community's children in accor-
dance with ancient and prescribed practice), though instituted only recently,
 
have become permanent items on the town
's calendar.
 These celebrations have
 
no antecedent in local experience,  and indeed--as several Dutch journalists
 
have pointed out--are more genuinely Dutch than our much-touted Tulip Time,
 
and may even be celebrated here with greater fidelity to older traditions
 
than what one might experience in much of the Netherlands!
 
Other examples of typically Dutch features which have firmly
 
established themselves in the community are the program of Dutch fronts
 
(authenticated facades required of new or renovated buildings in the
 
commercial district), and a zeal for authentication of Dutch costume designs
 
which, according to informants such as Mrs. Heusinkveld and Mrs. Zyistra,
 
goes beyond anything witnessed in previous decades.
 The reasons for the
 
popularity of such "
imported" Dutch cultural features are several: at the
 
crassest level,  they appeal to popular c1ich s of life in the Netherlands;
 
they are accessible to interested parties, whereas much of the local
 
tradition is not (it is only this year that the author of this report began,
 
under a grant from the Iowa Humanities Board and the National Endowment for
 
the Humanities,  to collect such frequently -unrecorded data as proverbs,
 
superstitions,  recreational habits and culinary practices recollected by the
 
town's oldest citizens); finally, there appears to be an uneasy realization
 
WEBBER -6-
by the generation of persons now in their prime that the "good old days" out
 
of which local Dutch-American tradition grew may not in all instances merit
 
uncritical acceptance and perpetuation as such.
 
Hence,  I can understand,  but cannot entirely concur with, occasional
 
expressions of disappointment that one does not find more typically Dutch art
 
or craft activity in Pella (though some forms, such as panel painting and
 
lacework, have enjoyed a phenomenal resurgence of popularity), that greater
 
use is not made of specialty foods, or that more homes do not exhibit
 
identifiably Dutch interiors and decorative schemes (a situation which is
 
clearly reversing itself).  For better or for worse,  these are simply not the
 
aspects of Dutch culture which Pella has chosen--at least until recently--to
 
perpetuate.
 
If the main emphasis is not on the Low Countries' physical culture,
 
there is certainly no energy spared in transmitting those values, attitudes
 
and behaviors perceived by the community as its true Dutch heritage.
 On
 
several occasions, my Ethnic Groups class has administered the Ethnic
 
Identity Profile,  a questionnaire which, in effect, asks respondents to
 
assign relative "weight" to such factors as family background, language
 
facility, church affiliation, community involvement, etc.
,  as indicators of
 
"greater or less Dutchness" in the eyes of the townsfolk.
 Responses to t' H
 
questionnaire,  as well as comments written in the margin or shared with t
 
investigator, and current interviews with persons such as Mrs. Heusinkveld
 
and the two principals, Mr. Groothuis and Mr. Vander Leest, make it clear
 
that the espousal of these values give as clear a signal as the display of
 
any physical object that one has enfranchised himself as a member of the
 
community.  One is frequently reminded (as we were on the evening of our
 
arrival in Pella)  that an "American" who embraces these values enjoys greater
 
WEBBER -7-
acceptance and mobility in the community than someone "
from a Dutch family"
 
who does not.
 
In great part,  these values are associated with,  or at least
 
reinforced, by Pella's preponderantly Calvinistic persuasion.
 (About two-
thirds of the town's churches, and probably a greater percentage of church-
goers, are affiliated with some branch of the Reformed movement.)  This fact
 
is reflected in a ruggedly staunch Sabbatarianism which is not only accepted,
 
but indeed willingly fostered, by a visible majority of Pella's residents.
 
On one occasion, when I flagged in my zeal to complete all of my yardwork by
 
Saturday evening,  I was lovingly but rather firmly reminded by a neighbor
 
that this was not just another day of the week, but de grote voorzondag, '
the
 
great pre-Sunday'  [
the period of preparation for Sabbath rest].
 
Also highly prized is an incredible attention to fiscal detail.
 
Often mistaken for avarice,  this actually reflects, as noted by Mrs.
 
Heusinkveld and others, a compelling need to be in control of those things
 
which have been entrusted to us,  and by which we shape, at least in part,
 
our own destinies.
 At the bottom line,  the attitude is one of responsible
 
(Christian) stewardship, and is reflected in a number of other behaviors
 
common in the community, such as the housewife's seemingly excessive atten-
tion to cleanliness.
 (Sweeping,  dusting and window-washing several times
 
during the week,, whether seemingly necessary or not,  is by no means uncommon.)
 
Related to the concept of stewardship is a sense of communal inter-
dependence.
 As pointed out by Mr. Gosselink, a member of the town's citizenry
 
will simply not be allowed to founder, and all should be assured of unflinching
 
aid,  should disaster intervene.
 A visible example of responsibility accepted
 
is the local hospital, built and expanded primarily through solicitation of
 
local funds (which,  unlike monies from governmental sources, would not obligate
 
WEBBER -8-
the hospital board to answer to anyone except members of the local community).
 
In the same context,  it is noteworthy that several informants (Mr. Gosselink,
 
Mr. Kooi) chose to cite teamwork as a main benefit of Tulip Time,  rather than
 
a great opportunity for "displaying one's wares" or for commercial gains.
 
Finally, it might be noted that what is often mistaken for nosyness on the
 
part of townsfolk may actually be an expression of concern about one's
 
welfare, and an affirmation of the fact that help is available if needed.
 
For all of these values,  family life is considered the appropriate
 
and proper model,  and it is no coincidence that school administrators and
 
teachers report well-night incredible levels of parental support.
 Hence,  it
 
comes as no surprise that,  in the transmission of those values which,  to the
 
residents of Pella,  are indeed indicators of ones "Dutchness", the community's
 
institutions (
including its schools) have enjoyed repeated success.
 
An Overview of Pella's Schools  
The Pella Community Schools had a total enrollment during the
 
1981-82 school year of some 1600 pupils; the Pella Christian Schools, which
 
offer programs from kindergarten through high school, had a total enrollment
 
of about 700 pupils.
 (
Pella's total population is approximately 8
,000.)
 
Although the Christian Schools resist the label "Christian Reformed Schools,"
 
the fact remains that Christian education was one of the main issues leading
 
to the split between the Reformed Church in America and the Christian
 
Reformed Church,  that most Christian Reformed families do try to send their
 
children to the Christian Schools, and that the majority of pupils in that
 
system are from families associated with the Christian Reformed Church.
 Mrs.
 
Kooi is probably correct in pointing out that the greater visibility which
 
the Christian Schools seem at times to enjoy in the area of heritage
 
education may be due as much to the homogeneity of the pupils' ethnic and
 
WEBBER -9-
 
religious background, as to any particular efforts on the part of teachers or
 
administrators.
 Mr. Groothuis, principal of the Pella Christian Grade
 
School, was quick to admit that his job is made considerably easier by the
 
commonality of experiences and goals of his pupils' parents.
 
For this report,  I have chosen to highlight one program of the
 
Pella Community Schools system (a heritage-awareness unit), an offering of
 
the Christian Schools (
the Dutch language), and the parallel music programs
 
of the two systems.
 I have also prepared an overview of opportunities for
 
the study of language,  folklore and music outside formal school settings.
 
The Path of Delft: A Case Study in Historical Fiction vs. Fictitious History  
Mrs. Muriel Kooi teaches fourth grade at Pella's Webster School.
 
She is a person whose many talents and awesome energy have won respect
 
throughout the community.  An active member of the Pella Historical Society,
 
she now sits on that group's board, and has accepted various committee
 
assignments.
 Demonstrating the zeal of one who has made the community her
 
own by choice,  rather than by birth,  she has actively promoted some of
 
Pella's most successful ethnic-heritage programs, and was responsible in
 
great measure for instigating the celebration of Pella's highly successful
 
Sinterklaas festivity.
 
Perhaps most important of all,  she has been supportive of
 
colleagues in their efforts.
 One example is her outspoken support of Mrs.
 
Jeanine Van Vark, whose reading group took important first steps toward a
 
goal expressed by several informants (Mr. Vander Leest, Mrs. Brummel, and
 
others): greater direct contact between pupils in the schools and the
 
community's senior citizens.
 Activities such as Mrs. Van Vark's program on
 
Pella's history, including a selection of songs in Dutch and English and
 
presented to residents of Fair Haven (a local retirement center), is seen as
 
WEBBER -10-
the sort of preliminary contact needed to facilitate greater involvement of
 
our older citizens, perhaps even as occasional classroom resource persons.
 
In addition to her other activities, Mrs. Kooi is a prolific
 
author.
 One successful series of articles,  for The Iowan, featured a number
 
of Pella's architectural landmarks.
 Her most widely read work, however,  and
 
the basis for her heritage-awareness unit,  is The Path of Delft, a work of
 
historical fiction whose title refers to a well-known incident in Pella's
 
r
;y history.
 Rev. Scholte's refined and cultured wife was--to put it
 
i
ly--taken a bit aback by the primitive conditions encountered upon
 
rival in (what was to become) Pella.
 Opening a chest containing her
 
ecious Delftware,  she discovered that the dishes, like many of her
 
expectations, had been irretrievably broken.
 The pieces, however, were saved
 
and used to pave a pathway through the formal gardens of her new home.
 S
ome
 
years ago, pieces of the pathway were discovered by workers on the highway
 
which runs past the Scholte House.
 The possible metaphoric meanings of the
 
pathway have remained vivid for Pella's citizenry.
 
Not far into the new calendar year, Mrs. Kooi begins a series of
 
readings and discussions of The Path of Delft. Attention to things Dutch
 
will already have been aroused by Mrs. Kooi' s  own enthusia sm , and by previous
 
units,  such as the production of Hans Brinker. Perhaps most exciting for
 
pupils, however, -
 is the series of some half a dozen walking tours, during
 
which children are invited to reinact the experiences of the book.
 The exact
 
itinerary varies from year to year, but typically includes:
 a retracing of
 
the final leg of the immigrants' trek to Pella; a tour of Pella's shop-windows,
 
which display early Dutch and American realia prior to Tulip Time; a visit to
 
the local graveyard, which includes a remarkably successful unit on culling
 
historical and cultural data from the gravestones; a trip through Pella's
 
WEBBER -11-
Historical Village (
to learn, as Mrs. Kooi put it,  that there is more there
 
than just the boyhood home of Waytt Earp); a tour of the Scholte House.
 
During her interview, Mrs. Kooi confirmed what I had already
 
gathered from casual conversations with her pupils:  the schoolchildren are
 
far more interested in history than fiction,  and that historical fiction
 
(i.e., a plausible retelling of what may well have taken place), is much
 
preferred over fictitious history (platitudes and cliches about the founding
 
fathers which, with little or no change,  could serve as the pres u
med common
 
historical background for members of virtually any ethnic group founded by
 
immigrants).  This preference for historical perspectives is a fine indicator
 
of the success of Mrs. Kooi's work.
 
When asked what they liked about the Path of Delft unit, pupils
 
responded with remarkable uniformity:  the material is local,  tangible,  theirs
 
to share in whether they are Dutch-American or not, and not distant or
 
foreign.
 This does not mean, however,  that Mrs. Kooi is more committed to
 
promoting a "local" understanding of Dutch culture than an "
imported"
 
version.  As stated in her interview, she staunchly favors an infusion of
 
Dutch culture into all programs, across the curricula.
 Mrs. Kooi spent the
 
summer of 1982 in the Netherlands,  collecting material (and at that, very
 
contemporary and distinctly Dutch,  rather than Dutch-American, material)
 
which will allow- her to implement her plans.
 
I believe, however,  that there is an easily-overlooked lesson to be
 
learned here.  Mrs. Kooi began with the local tradition,  invited all of her
 
pupils to share in it (
including her Asian pupils, who are frequently asked to
 
compare their acculturation experiences to those of Pella's founders), and has
 
then invited the pupils to learn about Dutch culture from a broader perspec-
tive.
 Obviously, the opposite approach also has its merits (Hans Brinker paves
 
WEBBER -12-
 
the way for The Path of Delft). 
In very general terms, however,  I sense that
 
it is more feasible,  in Pella,  to work from the local tradition into a broader
 
understanding of Dutch culture than vice versa; such will,  at any rate,
 
almost certainly be the case as an ever-greater segment of Dutch culture
 
makes its appearance in Pella and becomes a part of the local experience.
 
The ideal, of course, would be a synergism of "local" and "
imported" forces.
 
Music Makes the Difference!
 
As Mr. Vander T
.ees.
1 pointed out in his Master's thesis, Influence  
of the HolAdod 3a
r und on Education in the Pella Community Schools, 1847-
1
966, music programs enjoy a long tradition in Pella of transmitting and
 
±
nforcing an awareness of Dutch culture.
 In great part,  this is due to the
 
fforts of Miss Anne Tysseling, who took full advantage of the community's
 
iackground, and opportunities provided by festivals such as Tulip Time.
 Miss
 
Tysseling's resource materials have been passed on to Mrs. Brummel, who has
 
amassed an enviable libraryof musical and cultural literature.
 In both the
 
Community and Christian Schools,  music plays a prominent role in heritage
 
education:  the entire year's program is infused with appropriate Dutch
 
material, and that in a manner which clearly shows initiative on the
 
instructor's part going beyond any mandated requirements; an astonishing
 
passive (
and at times even active) knowledge of the language is transmitted
 
to pupils, with the result that music programs may be the unrecognized linch-
pin in community efforts to revitalize language; the instructors themselves
 
are remarkably versatile, and use the classroom (as observed in preparing
 
this report) for instruction in Dutch geography, history and culture.
 
Mrs. Brummel has, in her quiet way, put into practice much of what
 
others preach.
 A student of Jos Wuytack (
a major figure in Dutch children's
 
music), she has made a formal study of the Dutch language,  has traveled to
 
WEBBER -13-
the Netherlands, where she gathered both general cultural material and a very
 
full collection of children's musical literature, and has actively promoted
 
ever-greater participation by the children of the Community Schools in
 
festivals such as Sinterklaas and Tulip Time.
 She is also an outspoken
 
proponent of greater interaction between her pupils and the community's older
 
Dutch-American citizens.
 
During the school year,  there is a steady flow of Dutch music.
 
Thanksgiving and Pella's fall festival give opportunity for learning Wilt  
heden f
lu treden (the original of "We Gather Together") and various doxological
 
literature.
 Christmas is marked by both secular and sacred songs.
 S
pring
 
brings its own genre of folksongs,  and a birthday may well be marked by
 
singing the Dutch Lang zullen ze leven. There are children's dances, songs
 
with motions, and a sampling of international favorites (
such as Broeder
 
Jacob, or Fr re Jacques). The musical selection may be the sweet lullaby
 
Slaap kindje slaap, or a sober selection from the Dutch Psalter.
 A role model
 
in all that she asks her children to do, Mrs. Brummel also performs, and her
 
participation in recorder duets from the Psalter offers her pupils palpable
 
inspiration.
 
Mr. Kooi,  music teacher at Pella Christian Grade School, is also a
 
person of many talents.
 In his "
spare" time, he serves as the music director
 
of a large Christian Reformed congregation, directs choral and bell-choir
 
groups, and plays accordion for the Dutch Family Singers and Dancers.
 On the
 
basis of classroom observation,  I would have to conclude that he puts equal
 
energy into an open and frank stat ement of his Christian principles, and in
 
fact may see himself as much in the role of a spokesman for the faith as in
 
that of a music instructor.
 In terms of the school's goals, as expressed by
 
his principal, Mr. Groothuis, Mr. Kooi is probably j
ust the sort of person
 
WEBBER -14-
needed in his position: a teacher of unquestioned credentials and talents; a
 
member of the community sensitive to its values; an outspoken Christian in
 
the Reformed tradition; that notwithstanding, an open-minded innovator.
 
The list of year-long features offered in Mr. Kooi's classes would,
 
in great part,  duplicate that given for Mrs. Brumn l's classes.
 One
 
difference, however,  is worth dwelling upon,  not because it represents any
 
real divergence in the two instructors' outlooks, but rather in the areas
 
chosen for emphasis in talks with the investigator.
 
Several informants (
inter al., Mrs. Schiebout,  Sr.) expressed the
 
idea that one of Pella's traditions which ought under no circumstances be
 
allowed to founder is that of Dutch Psalm-singing.  Mr. Kooi, who is active
 
in revitalizing Psalm singing (and who has enjoyed some success in stirring
 
up pupil interest) is seen by a number of persons as just the sort of
 
influential figure required for a more-than-pro-forma perpetuation of this
 
tradition.
 As I shall point out in the section on language learning,  the
 
real reason for language instruction is often not acquisition of fluency, but
 
rather an approach to the affective and experiential domain of the older
 
speakers (
as Mrs. Zylstra said,  to share in expression of the perspectives
 
and feelings of those who have transmitted the heritage to us).
 In a similar
 
vein,  it is significant that Mr. Kooi found language instruction valuable in
 
helping one to understand cultural origins or differences; an expression of
 
complete range of human emotion, however (and hence, by contextual implication,
 
the key to understanding ourselves), is given by the Dutch Psalter.
 Mr. Kooi
 
has found,  in the Dutch Psalter,  the mechanism for addressing a fundamental
 
issue in heritage education:
 the need to assure some sense of continuity
 
between the constellation of emotional forces which sustained the older
 
generation, and that which will motivate the up-coming generation.
 
WEBBER -15-
Language Instruction
  
One frequently hears statements to the effect that Pella is down to
 
her last 100 speakers of Dutch,  and these are going fast!
 I
t is
 
the primary speaker-population has now reached retirement age.
 
engaged in free socialization in Dutch, however, with persons (
a.b., not from
 
the families of immigrants) who are as young as 30-35.
 This situation is
 
admittedly a rare one, and I find it about the age-range of 50-55 which
 
begins to offer an appreciable pool of speakers.
 As I have pointed out in
 
some of r
ay sociolinguistic studies, it is not so much the speaker of Dutch
 
which is dying out,  as is the sort of social situatin which demanded its use.
 
It would be difficult to esti
inae the exact number of speakers,
 
though if we are indeed down to our last 100, then I have observed, recorded
 
or polled more speakers than are supposed to be available.
 Rather,  such
 
statements are to be seen as one reflection of the community's attitude
 
toward the Dutch language.
 The Dutch spoken in Pella has a number of non-
standard forms of which its speakers are acutely aware.
 In addition,  the
 
hybrid forms of the language in current use even by teenagers (Yankee Dutch)
 
would not necessarily be intelligible to a person versed only in the standard
 
language.
 There is probably no area of Dutch culture in which the difference
 
between the "local" and the "imported" version is sensed as strongly as in
 
the linguistic arena.
 I
t is policy de rigeur for a speaker approached by an
 
investigator to delineate the difference between "High Dutch," deftig or
 
goed Hollands (
'good Dutch') on the one hand, and "Low Dutch," "Pella Dutch"
 
or "Household Dutch" on the other,  and then (if one has not formally studied
 
the language) to disclaim the status of a speaker.
 In one instance, a member
 
of the community denied almost categorically any knowledge of the language,
 
only later (admittedly, after a certain "
thawing out" period) to give an
 
interview, almost entirely in Dutch.
 
WEBBER -16-
Two examples of non-standard forms might be given; both have,
 
incidentally, been recorded among similar speaker-populations.
 One evening
 
in my Dutch class at Central College a review of the Dutch verb zijn '
to be'
 
(even more irregular in the present tense than its English equivalent)
 
prompted a class member who is a prominent Pella resident, and quite clearly
 
one for whom Dutch was a household language,  to question the accuracy of my
 
forms.
 He then gave the forms heard so frequently in Pella, which are
 
perfectly regular, and based upon only one of the three stems used in the
 
standard Dutch paradigm of the verb.
 Another hybrid form is spraten '
to
 
talk.'
 Some see it as a blend of the synonyms spreken and praten; I have
 
heard the incorrect syllabic division Holland spraten for Hollands praten
  
'
to speak Dutch' so often that I prefer the latter as an explanation for the
 
genesis of spraten. 
At any rate,  there is an unmistakable reticence exhibited
 
Pella's speakers of Dutch.
 For reasons alluded to above and for sti l
l oc
-i
er
 
reasons too numerous to treat here,  there is a long-standing aversion toward
 
use of the language in the presence of "Americans," whose language is that of
 
the dominant culture; there is an even greater hesitancy to use the language
 
with any speaker of Dutch who might cast disparagement upon the local idiom.
 
Ironically, it is precisely the abundance of non-standard forms in Pella
 
Dutch which causes many speakers to despair of any hopes for the language's
 
survival, and consequently to hasten its untimely demise through disuse,
 
when, quite the contrary, the fact that such hybrid forms can evolve shows
 
the linguist (who recognizes change as a universal of living languages) that
 
Pella Dutch still exhibits the potential for vitality.
 
Several attempts have,  in fact,  been made to resuscitate Dutch in
 
Pella.
 In the mid-1950's, one of the members of a prominent family approached
 
WEBBER -17-
the superintendent of the Community Schools, and persuaded him to initiate a
 
Dutch program.
 The p a r e n t
' s  son happened to be in the class of Miss Dena
 
Versteeg, a teacher who, prior to her retirement in the early l
97O's,
 
dedicated over forty years of her life to public instruction; in addition to
 
being a beloved and respected teacher, Miss Versteeg was--and continues to
 
be--regarded as a precious human resource in our community for information on
 
the local Dutch tradition.
 Fluent in Dutch,  she approached the instruction of
 
the language with a strong sense of concern for detail and correctness.
 I
 
have had casual conversations with persons involved with her program, and all
 
concur in giving it high marks, at least from the pupils' point of view.
 
From the administrator's point of view, things were evidently less rosy.
 
Scheduling adjustments needed to be made,  especially for pupils who had begun
 
as fifth-graders and wanted to continue as sixth-graders.
 At the end of the
 
second year of the program, the principal intervened, and Dutch was droopped
 
from the curriculum.
 
In 1978, Mrs. Harriet Zyistra,  librarian and resources coordinator
 
for the Pella Christian Grade School (which offers instruction through eighth
 
grade) initiated an enrichment program in Dutch for seventh-graders.
 Classes
 
met twice a week, and used a variety of materials.
 Mrs. Zyistra had obtained
 
an instructional-materials grant from the Netherlands Ministry of Science and
 
Education, which provided her with a complete course in Dutch.  Although the
 
Dutch materials were designed primarily for the younger children of guest
 
workers in the Netherlands, Mrs. Zyistra adapted then to the needs of her
 
pupils, produced a small handbook of conversational Dutch based on the every-
day experiences of a traveler in the Netherlands, read from the New Testament
 
in Today's Dutch (Groot Nleuws voor U), held memorization contests based on a
 
locally produced and recently reprinted volume, Dutch Nursery Rhymes, and
 
WEBBER -18-
topped off the year with a Dutch meal,  at which occasion one had to speak
 
Dutch in order to be served.
 
It is worth noting that Mrs. Zylstra combined an appreciation for
 
formal correctness in language instruction with a sensitivity to the potential
 
of language as a transmitter of cultural values.
 Two points brought up in her
 
interview might be cited to illustrate her views in this regard.
 On the one
 
hand, her "wish list"  (
as well as that of her principal) would include the
 
identification--and,  if necessary, production--of a rigorous, challenging
 
grammar suited to the needs of an American seventh grader, and geared toward
 
helping the pupil in both languages.
 On the other hand, her real goal in
 
teaching Dutch lies not so much in facilitating fluency, but rather in
 
facilitating the participation of her pupils in the affective domain of their
 
cultural forebearers,  i
.e., to "
feel" like a Dutchman,  and to be able to
 
those feelings in the one language which has proven itself capable of the
 
expression.
 
(As an aside, one might mention the fact that "Yankee Dutch"--which
 
is alive and doing very well,  thank you, in the Pella Community and Christian
 
Schools--consists primarily of English syntax and grammar with Dutch
 
vocabulary; the overwhelming majority of "Yankee Dutch" terms express feelings
 
or social activities for which English has no single term.
 Some examples are:
 
suf '
dull,  lethargic, unable to get moving'; benauwi '
constricted,  stifled,
 
oppressed, anxious'; vies '
squeemish,  finicky, skittish'; knoeien around '
mess
 
around, make a mess, bungle,  botch up'.  No doubt many of her pupils came to
 
Mrs. Zylstra with at least some idea of how it felt to be a Dutchman.)
 
Considering that she did her work without special released time,
 
Mrs. Zylstra certainly deserves the commendation which one hears from former
 
pupils (
and parents of the annual dozen or so pupils) associated with the
 
WEBBER -19-
Dutch program.
 By 1980, however,  it was becoming clear that special
 
scheduling considerations needed to be made,  and hence,  though the Christian
 
Grade School remains proud as punch of the letters of praise which it received
 
from the Dutch government,  the program was dropped at the end of its second
 
year.
 I believe that the Christian Grade School principal, Mr. Ivan Groothuis,
 
is sincere in stating that the reintroduction of Dutch would be a priority for
 
any future program revisions;  time alone will tell if such is to be the case.
 
Still another program was tried out in the late l96O's with the
 
combined seventh and eighth graders at the Christian School in nearby Peoria,
 
Iowa (
a community strongly identified with the Dutch-American territory
 
surrounding Pella).  Mr. Robert De Jager,  a native of the Netherlands and
 
principal-teacher of the seventh/eighth grade class,  introduced Dutch, only to
 
find that,  in time,  parents complained that pupils were putting too much
 
energy into Dutch at the expense of other subjects, and that some seventh-
grade pupils felt disadvantaged being in the same class with eighth-graders
 
who had studied Dutch the year before.
 Scheduling and feasibility problems
 
became apparent,  and,  in a now hauntingly familiar pattern,  the program was
 
dropped at the end of its second year.
 
Mr. De Jager, however,  is both versatile and resiliant.
 Upon
 
retirement (and a feature article in the local newspaper on his many-sided
 
career), this educator-broadcaster-mu sician-preacher-craft sman moved to Pella.
 
Here he immersed himself even more fully than before in church and civic
 
activities,  in his weekly Dutch-language radio program, and in a variety of
 
educational programs, particularly those of the Christian Opportunity Center
 
(a special-education and sheltered workshop complex).
 
At the same time, Mr. De Jager quietly began tutoring Dutch.
 
Without any particular advertisement, he has worked (
since autumn,  1981) with
 
WEBBER -20-
six pupils from four families.
 Some measure of his success is given by the
 
fact that all of his pupils but one are continuing through the summer, and that
 
two high-school age pupils (
one who had dropped out of the program because of
 
a heavy schedule of sports and studies, and another who had been in Mrs.
 
Zyistra's program) have voluntarily reinitiated their study of Dutch under Mr.
 
De Jager.
 Parents appear to be more than satisfied with the instructor,  whose
 
lesson typically includes not only grammar and useful expressions, but also
 
some religious text (a prayer,  a verse from the Dutch Psalter,  the retelling
 
of a Bible story, or the text of a hymn).  The latter reflects the point made
 
by Mr. De Jager during his interview, that one of the most useful aspects
 
of language study in his own experience has been the ability it has given him
 
to get at the core meaning of Scripture by comparing the way in which the same
 
idea is expressed in several languages.
 Although it was said in the context
 
of his ability to relate well across generational lines,  I sense that the
 
concern for the understanding and transmission of religious values was also
 
implied in the statement of one parent that the instructor is "
the sort of
 
person every child should experience at least once."
 
The reasons that pupils give for learning Dutch differ little from
 
those given by pupils in similar programs elsewhere:  there is a desire t
 
socialize with members of the older generation,  to come closer to one's roots,
 
and to be prepared for a more meaningful travel experience in the Netherlands.
 
Even though there is little activity in realization of these goals, both pupis
 
and parents seem remarkably content with the results of the language programs.
 
I strongly suspect that language fluency per se is not the real objective of
 
language classes.
 Rather, participation in the classes is seen as a sign of
 
affirmation of values which must now be transmitted to the coming generation.
 
Mrs. Schiebout,  Sr., who is delighted with her granddaughters' language
 
WEBBER -21-
studies, was quite clear in stating that what she wanted most for her
 
grandchildren was the perpetuation of the religius experience and a love of
 
cleanliness (
cf. comments above on com munity values!).  This does not mean
 
that she is indifferent to the language: much of our interview centered around
 
the "untranslatables" of the Dutch language.
 I
t simply means that cultural
 
components (
such as the language) are merely reflections of cultural values.
 
Another example of language-learning as affirmation of group values
 
was given by Mr. Gosselink, who spoke at length on the need for a special tie
 
to, and respect for,  the Dutch heritage.
 During his time in the military
 
service, Mr. Gosselink met members of another Dutch-American community; while
 
he was delighted to be able to communicate with his ethnic peers, he regretted
 
the fact that they were generally more fluent in Dutch than he, and hence
 
perhaps a bit closer to the generation which was more fully Dutch.
 Without
 
being particularly adament on the point, he hopes that language instruction
 
will give his children a chance to realize what he would have wanted to
 
experience.
 
Among the factors cited for giving one child Dutch lessons was the
 
fact that she reportedly cried to learn that she was only half Dutch-American.
 
The child had already made the first statement of affirmed solidarity with the
 
ethnic group, and should therefore be allowed to make the next logical step in
 
affirming its heritage and values.
 The point, of course,  is not the charming
 
story of the child, but rather the insight which it gives us into comnunity
 
attitudes.  Among other things,  ethnic heritage education becomes part of a
 
rite of passage,  and the failure to recognize it as such and support it for
 
its underlying value would, as the extreme consequence, mean a deterioration
 
of the ties which contribute to group cohesiveness across generational lines.
 
WEBBER -22-
Assessments and Projections  
It may well be that the future of heritage and language education
 
wil lie to an ever-greater extent outside of formal school settings.
 In
 
addition to private language tutoring,  there are several private and public
 
programs which may assume more and more importance.
 The Dutch Family S
ingers
 
and Dancers are a cooperative venture by a number of families (
and individuals)
 
who practice Dutch songs and dances to be performed at Tulip Time and on
 
various occasions throughout the year.
 Most recently, a small contingent
 
performed at the send-off ceremony for three students who had won free trips
 
to the Netherlands in an essay contest sponsored by the Pella Historical
 
Society.
 S
everal years ago,  the group traveled to Ames,  Iowa to welcome the
 
(
overwhelmed
) members of the visiting Amsterdam Concertgebouw Orchestra.
 The
 
group has been active for nearly twenty years, and counts among its members
 
senior citizens,  children whose parents are not members, but who come with
 
friends whose families are,  singles, couples, and entire fam ilies.
 Practice
 
sessions for the group are the only occasion on which I have observed or
 
experienced spontaneous socialization in Dutch with persons my age (mid- to
 
late 30's).  While it is not overwhelmingly common,  some join the group for
 
the express purpose of exposing their children to other persons who use the
 
Dutch language.
 Such was the case,  for example,  for the family of an active
 
member of the Christian Reformed Church and a leader in the Calvinist Cadet
 
Core (Christian Reformed scout program).  Though only in his early 30's,
 
the father of the family is an active speaker of Dutch who consistently greets
 
me in both languages.
 A program began this year at the public library which
 
includes a component of Dutch children's lore, nursery rhymes,  sayings in
 
Dutch, and Dutch children's literature in translation.
 
WEBBER -23-
The idea which holds the most promise is that of instituting a
 
"Board of Dutch Education" in Pella.
 I
t is envisioned that such a group would
 
be influential in the coordination and centralization of efforts such as those
 
described here,  and would address itself to matters of feasibility and follow-
through in those instances where an instructor or program director needs
 
energy and/or sheer influence which goes beyond her/his own resources.
 The
 
head of such a group would have to be an individual (
or governing committee)
 
with considerable credibility and influence, and, above all,  the ability to
 
bring together the community's many interests without favor or partiality.
 
I sincerely wish Pella the realization of such hopes, and that with as little
 
delay as possible.

ETHNIC HERITAGE AND LANGUAGE EDUCATION
 
Pella,  Iowa
 
Final Report by Philip E. Webber
 
Pella, Iowa was founded in 1
847 by a group of religious separatists from
 
the Netherlands, under the leadership of the charismatic Reverend H
. P.
 
Scholte. In addition to being a minister, Scholte gained prominence as an
 
entrepreneur, publisher, educator, and politician. Had his foreign birth not
 
disqualified him for the position, he would have been Lincoln's choice for an
 
ambassadorial post in Austria. The well-high palatial home of Reverend Scholte
 
still s
tands in impressive grandeur on the north side of the t
own square; its
 
interior and contents have enjoyed painstaking curatorial care under Mrs.
 
Martha Lautenbach, justly regarded as the community's most knowledgeable member
 
in matters of local history. A reconstruction of Scholte's church, with
 
original baptismal font and pulpit, stands on the edge of Pella's Historical
 
Village, where homes and stores of the early period display artifacts and
 
memorabilia of the community's founders and provide the setting for various
 
cultural activities discussed below. Several of Scholte's descendents have
 
achieved a prominence of their own in the town's civic, educational, and social
 
circles.
 
Pella received its name from the city of ancient Macedonia which provided
 
early Christians with a haven from persecution, and is often referred to, both
 
formally and informally, as "The City of Ref
 uge.'
while it may have been a
 
city of refuge for Scholte and his followers, Pella was by no means isolated
 
from the rest of the country. Throughout much of its history Pella has shown
 
remarkably little of the sentimental longing for the homeland which pervades so
 
many ethnic communities; and from the beginning its leaders have fostered the
 
acculturation of the town's residents t
o the new setting in which they found
 
2
 
themselves. One familiar story (whose historical veracity has been questioned,
 
but which, even if apocryphal,  indicates just what is considered plausible for
 
the period and person in question) tells of an attempt by Scholte to gain
 
permission for his followers to recite the Pledge of Allegiance in Dutch, so
 
that no time would be lost in acquiring American citizenship. A prolific
 
writer, Scholte signed many publications produced in his new homeland with such
 
by-lines as "An Adopted Citizen."
 
The idea that Holland had definitely been left on the other side of the
 
ocean was reinforced by events early in this century. While Iowa was relatively
 
slow to enact legislation banning the use of foreign languages during World War
 
I
, it more than compensated for its late start by approving what is generally
 
regarded as one of the most severe laws in the country. Virtually any use of a
 
language other than English, in contexts which could be considered public,
 
constituted a crime. Older members of the community recount with visible
 
emotion the experience of being in church on Sunday when an inspector appeared,
 
unannounced, to check on compliance with the law. In a word, it was dangerous
 
to be Dutch.
 
It was also embarrassing to be Dutch! Waves of immigrants arrived around
 
the time of World War I
, and these groentjes (greenhorns) are remembered
 
primarily for their persistence in wearing outlandish costumes (e.g. baggy
 
pants), overwhelmingly rural orientation (whereas Pella was firmly established
 
as a commercial center), and (real or imagined) opportunism, perceived as
 
detrimental to the town's characteristic spirit of communal interdependence.
 
Still other problems arrived with the influx of immigrants during the
 
Depression and after World War II. In each instance a relatively homogeneous
 
3
 
community's assured understanding of proper Dutch values and attitudes was
 
challenged by the values and attitudes of real, live Dutchmen from tL
 
homeland, and in each instance the local Dutch-Americans exhibited a certain
 
defensiveness and subsequent disinclination to embrace the homeland's culture
 
with anything approaching unbounded enthusiasm.
 
The pervasiveness of such attitudes toward the culture of the Low Countries
 
only began to abate with the generation of persons now in their early forties.
 
As a result, those who undertook programs in ethnic heritage education had to
 
face the dilemma of choosing between transmitting Dutch culture (
though it may
 
be imported, at times even intrusive, and frequently foreign t
o the local
 
experience) and perpetuating Dutch-American values and practices (which often
 
enough strike a native of the Netherlands as quaint, antiquated, or even
 
bizarre).
 
This point may be illustrated by two i
tems commonly associated with ethnic
 
groups: food and music. The typical childhood diet of Pella's older residents
 
did not admit of great variety, and might have consisted of bread dipped in
 
melted lard and sorghum molasses for breakfast; potatoes, meat, and red cabbage
 
for the main noon dinner; and an evening lunch of leftovers, perhaps with
 
buttermilk porridge and molasses cake. Festivities such as Thanksgiving might
 
provide occasion for Jan-in-de-pan (pancakes). Such a diet was dictated as much
 
by local conditions as by any Dutch culinary traditions, and even the bologna
 
which has made Pella famous in central Iowa was introduced by a German. This
 
does not mean that typically Dutch foods are unfamiliar to Pella's residents.
 
On the contrary, two bakeries with Dutch specialties do a healthy business, and
 
no festival is complete without poffertjes or oliebollen (varieties of fried
 
4
 
baked goods). There i
s also certain status accorded to housewives who can
 
prepare authentic Dutch meals. As enthusiastically as such meals are received,
 
however, they do not necessarily replicate the cuisine of grandmother's
 
kitchen, and the young person who acquires the recipe for a typically Dutch
 
dish may well provide grandmother with a few surprises.
 
Pella has been consistently supportive of musical activities. Reverend
 
Scholte's wife was a conservatory-trained vocalist, and for a t
ime the town
 
supported an opera-house. After the Civil War Pella was the home of the
 
renowned Light Infantry Band. To the present day the public and private schools
 
offer superior musical programs and the town abounds in musicians of all sorts,
 
many of whom participate in an annual series of summer concerts or play in the
 
college-community orchestra. Dutch hymns and folk songs are heared from the
 
carillons located at the Tulip Tower and on the Central College campus. For
 
older members of the community, however, whose main musical experience in a
 
Dutch context was the singing of the Dutch Psalter (until rather recently, the
 
only form of hymnody in the Christian Reformed Church), it comes as a
 
surprise--albeit perhaps a pleasant one--to learn that the melody of our
 
Thanksgiving song
 
that the pleasant
 
street organ used
 
"We Gather Together" is actually that of a Dutch hymn, or
 
little tunes coming from the carillon, performed on the
 
during summer kermis (carnival), and sung by the Dutch Family
 
Singers and Dancers as they stroll the streets at Tulip Time are indeed genuine
 
Dutch music.
 
Today, more often than not, the import wins out over local tradition. The
 
summer kermis and December Sinterklaas festivity (during which the good Saint
 
Nicholas arrives on horseback, accompanied by appropriately clad attendants,
 
5
 
and meets out the year's just deserts to the community's children in accordance
 
with ancient and prescribed practice), though instituted only recently, have
 
become permanent items on the town's calendar. These celebrations have no
 
antecendent in local experience, and indeed--as several Dutch journalists have
 
pointed out--are more genuinely Dutch than our much-touted Tulip Time. They may
 
even be celebrated here with greater fidelity to older traditions than what one
 
might experience in much of the Netherlands!
 
Other examples of typically Dutch features which have recently established
 
themselves in the community are the program of Dutch fronts (authenticated
 
acades required of new or renovated buildings in the commercial district), and
 
zeal for authentication of Dutch costume designs which, according to
 
informants such as Mrs. Heusinkveid and Mrs. Zyistra, goes beyond anything
 
witnessed in previous decades. There are several reasons for the popularity of
 
such "imported'  Dutch cultural features: at the crassest level, they appeal to
 
popular cliches of life in the Netherlands; they are accessible to interested
 
parties, whereas much of the local tradition is no
 
and, finally, there
 
appears to be an uneasy realization by the generation  now in its prime that
 
the "good old days" out of which local Dutch-American tradition grew may not in
 
all instances merit uncritical acceptance and perpetuation.
 
If the main emphasis historically has not been on the Low Countries'
 
material culture, certainly there has been no energy spared in transmitting
 
values, attitudes and behaviors perceived by the community as representing its
 
6
 
true Dutch heritage. Espousal of such  values give as clear a signal as the
 
display of any physical object that one is an enfranchised member of the
 
community. One is frequently reminded in Pella that an "American" who embraces
 
these values enjoys greater acceptance and mobility in the community than
 
someone "
from a Dutch family" who does not. In great part such values are
 
associated with, or at least reinforced by, Pella's preponderantly Calvinistic
 
persuasion. (About two-thirds of the town's churches, and probably a greater
 
percentage of church goers, are affiliated with some branch of the Reformed
 
Movement.) This fact is reflected in a ruggedly staunch Sabbatarianisni which is
 
not only accepted, but indeed willingly fostered, by a visible majority of
 
Pella' s residents
 
Another highly prized trait is an incredible attention to fiscal detail.
 
Often mistaken for avarice,  this actually reflects a compelling need to be in
 
control of those things which have been entrusted to us and by which we shape,
 
at least in part, our own destinies. On the bottom line the attitude is one of
 
responsible (Christian) stewardsnip and i
s reflected in a number of other
 
behaviors common in the community, such as the housewife's seemingly excessive
 
attention to cleanliness. (Sweeping, dusting, and window washing several times
 
during the week, whether seemingly necessary or not, is by no means uncommon.)
 
Related to the concept of stewardship is a sense of communal
 
interdependence. A member of the town's citizenry will simply not be allowed to
 
founder, and all are assured of unflinching aid, should disaster intervene. A
 
7
 
visible example of responsibility accepted is the local hospital, built and
 
expanded primarily through solicitation of local funds (wriich, unlike monies
 
from governm ental sources, does not obligate the hospital board to answer to
 
anyone except members of the local community). In the same context, it is
 
noteworthy that several informants chose to cite teamwork as a main benefit of
 
Tulip Time, rather than the great opportunity for "displaying one's wares" or
 
for commercial gains. Finally, it might be noted that what is often mistaken
 
for nosiness on the part of townsfolk may actually be an expression of concern
 
about one's welfare and an affirmation of the fact that help is available if
 
needed.
 
For all of these values family life is considered the appropriate and
 
proper model, and it is no coincidence that school administrators and teachers
 
report incredible levels of parental support. Hence, it comes as no surprise
 
that, in the transmission of those values, which t
o the residents of Pella are
 
indeed indicators of ones "Dutch-ness", the community's institutions (including
 
its schools) have enjoyed repeated success.
 
An Overview of Pella's Schools
 
The Pella Community Schools had a total enrollment during the 1
981-1982
 
school year of some 1
,600 pupils. The Pella Christian Schools, which offer
 
programs from kindergarten through high school, had a total enrollment of about
 
700 pupils. (Pella's total population is approximately 8,000.) Although the
 
Christian schools resist the label "Christian Reformed Schools," the fact
 
remains that Christian education was one of the main issues leading to the
 
8
 
split between the Reformed Church in America and the Christian Reformed Church,
 
that most Christian Reformed families do try to send their children to the
 
Christian schools, and that the majority of pupils in that system are from
 
families associated with the Christian Reformed Church. Mrs. Kooi, who teaches
 
fourth grade at Webster School, is probably correct in pointing out that the
 
greater visibility which the Christian schools seem at times to enjoy in the
 
area of heritage education may be due as much to the homogeneity of the pupils'
 
ethnic and religious background, as to any particular efforts on the part of
 
teachers or administrators. Mr. Groothuis, principal of the Pella Christian
 
Grade School, was quick t
o admit that his job is made considerably easier by
 
the commonality of experiences and goals of his pupils' parents.
 
For this report, I have chosen to highlight a heritage-awareness unit
 
offered by the Pella Community Schools system, a Dutch language course of the
 
Christian Schools, and the parallel music programs of the two systems. I have
 
also prepared an overview of the opportunities for the study of language,
 
folklore, and music which exist outside formal
, school settings.
 
The Path of Delft: Heritage-Awareness Unit
 
Mrs. Muriel Kooi teaches fourth grade at Pella's Webster School. She is a
 
person whose many talents and awesome energy have won respect throughout the
 
community. Mrs. Kooi is a prolific author. One successful series of articles,
 
for The Iowan, featured a number of Pella's architectural landmarks. Her most
 
widely read work, however, is The Path of Delft, which is the basis for her
 
heritage-awareness unit. It is a  work of historical fiction whose title refers
 
9
 
to a well-known incident in Pella's early history. Reverend Scriolte's refined
 
and cultured wife was —to put it mildly--taken aback by the primitive
 
conditions encountered upon arrival in her new home. Opening a chest containing
 
her precious Delftware, she discovered that the dishes, like many of her
 
expectations, had been irretrievably broken. The pieces, however, were saved
 
and used to pave a pathway through the formal gardens of her new home. Some
 
years ago pieces of the pathway were discovered by workers on the highway which
 
runs past the Scholte House. The possible metaphoric meanings of the pathway
 
have remained vivid for Pella's citizenry.
 
Early in the new school year Mrs. Kooi begins a series of readings and
 
discussions of The Path of Delft in her heritage-awareness class. The readings
 
are supplemented by a series of walking tours during which children are invited
 
to reinact the experiences of the book. The exact itinerary varies from year to
 
year, but typically includes: a retracing of the final leg of the immigrants'
 
trek to Pella; a tour of Pella's shop-windows prior to Tulip Time to view their
 
displays of early Dutch and American realia; a visit to the local graveyard
 
during which students cull historical and cultural data from the gravestones; a
 
trip through Pella's Historical Village (to learn, as Mrs. Kooi puts it, that
 
there is more there than just the boyhood home of Waytt Earp); and a tour of
 
the Scholte House.
 
During her interview Mrs. Kooi confirmed what I had already gathered from
 
casual conversations with her pupils. The schoolchildren are far more
 
interested in history than fiction, and historical fiction (i.e., a plausible
 
retelling of what may well have taken place) is much preferred over fictitious
 
10
 
history (platitudes and cliches about the founding fathers which, with little
 
or no change,  could serve as the presumed common historical background for
 
members of virtually any ethnic group founded by immigrants).
 
When asked what they liked about the Path of Delft unit, pupils responded
 
with remarkable uniformity:  the material is local, tangible, theirs to share in
 
whether they are Dutch-American or not, and neither distant nor foreign. This
 
does not mean, however, that Mrs. Kooi is more committed to promoting a "local"
 
understanding of Dutch culture than an "imported" version. Mrs. Kooi begins
 
with the local tradition, inviting all of her pupils to share in i
t (including
 
u
:
 i  are frequently asked to compare their acculturation
 
Pella's founders). Later she encourages the pupils t

Music Makes the Difference!
 
Music programs enjoy a long tradition of transmitting and enforcing an
 
awareness of Dutch culture in Pella. In both community and Christian schools
 
music plays a prominent role in heritage education. The entire year's program
 
is infused with appropriate Dutch material in a manner which clearly shows
 
initiative on the instructor's part going beyond any mandated requirements. An
 
astonishing passive (and at times even active) knowledge of the language is
 
transmitted to pupils, with the result that music programs may be the
 
1
1
 
unrecognized linchpin in community efforts to revitalize language. The
 
instructors themselves are remarkably versatile, and use the music lessons as
 
an opportunity for instruction in Dutch geography, history, and culture as
 
well.
 
Mrs. Brummel, the music teacher at Webster and Lincoln schools, has, in
 
her quiet way, put into practice much of what others preach. A student of Jos
 
Wuytack (a major figure in Dutch children's music), she has made a formal study
 
of the Dutch language, has traveled t
o the Netherlands, where she gathered both
 
general cultural material and a very full collection of children's musical
 
literature, and has actively promoted ever-greater participation by the
 
children of the Pella Community Schools in festivals such as Sinterklaas and
 
Tulip Time. She is also an outspoken proponent of greater interaction between
 
her pupils and the community's older Dutch-American citizens.
 
There is a steady flow of Dutch music during the school year. Thanksgiving
 
and Pella's fall festival provide an opportunity for learning "Wilt heden nu
 
treden" (the original of "We Gather Together") and doxological literature.
 
Christmas is marked by both secular and sacred songs, while spring brings its
 
own genre of folksongs. A birthday may well be marked by singing the Dutch
 
"Lang zullen ze leven." Other birthday favorites are children's dances, songs
 
with motions, and a sampling of international favorites (such as "Broeder
 
Jacob," or "Frere Jacques"). The musical selection may be the sweet lullaby,
 
"Slaap kindje slaap," or a sober selection from the Dutch Psalter. A role model
 
in all that she asks her children to do, Mrs. Brummel also performs, and her
 
participation in recorder duets from the Psalter offers her pupils palpable
 
inspiration.

Mr. Kooi, music teacher at Pella Christian Grade School, is also a person
 
of many talents. In his spare time he serves as the music director of a large
 
Christian Reformed congregation, directs choral and bell-choir groups, and
 
plays accordion for the Dutch Family Singers and Dancers. In terms of the
 
school's goals, as expressed by Principal Groothuis, Mr. Kooi is probably just
 
the sort of person needed in his position: a teacher of unquestioned
 
credentials and talents; a member of the community sensitive to its values; an
 
outspoken Christian in the Reformed tradition; and an open-minded innovator.
 
Language Instruction
 
One frequently hears statements to the effect that Pella i
s down to her
 
last 100 speakers of Dutch, and these are going fast! It is true that the
 
primary Dutch speakers have now reached retirement age. As I have pointed out
 
in some of my sociolinguistic studies, however, it is not so much the speaker
 
of Dutch which is dying out as is the sort of social situation which demanded
 
its use.
 
It would be difficult to estimate the exact number of speakers left.
 
Rather, such statements are to be seen as one reflection of the community's
 
attitude toward the Dutch language. The Dutch spoken in Pella has a number of
 
non-standard forms of which its speakers are acutely aware. In addition, the
 
hybrid forms of the language in current use even by teenagers (Yankee Dutch)
 
would not necessarily be intelligible to a person versed only in the standard
 
language. There is probably no area of Dutch culture in which the difference
 
1
3
 
between the "local" and the "imported" version is sensed as strongly as in the
 
linguistic arena. It is de rigueur for a speaker approached by an investigator
 
to delineate the difference between "high Dutch," deftig, or "good Dutch," goed
  
Hollands, on the one hand, and "low Dutch," "Pella Dutch," or "household Dutch"
 
on the other, and then (if one has not formally studied the language) to
 
disclaim his or her status as a speaker. In one instance a member of the
 
community denied almost categorically any knowledge of the language, only later
 
to give an interview almost entirely in Dutch.
 
Two examples of non-standard forms may be given;  both have, incidentally,
 
been recorded among similar speaker-populations. One evening in my Dutch cla
 
at Central College a review of the Dutch verb zijn (
to be--even more irregular
 
in the present tense than its English equivalent) prompted a class member, who
 
is a prominent Pella resident and quite clearly one for whom Dutch was a
 
household language, t
o question the accuracy of my forms. He then gave the
 
forms heard so frequently in Pella, which are perfectly regular and based upon
 
only one of the three stems used in the standard Dutch paradigm of the verb.
 
Another hybrid form is spraten (to talk). Some see it as a blend of the
 
synonyms spreken and praten. I have heard the incorrect syllabic division
 
Holland spraten for Hollands praten (to speak Dutch) so often that I prefer the
 
latter as an e-xplanation for the genesis of spraten.
 
There is an unmistakable reticence exhibited by Pella's speakers of Dutch.
 
There is an even greater hesitancy to use the language with any speaker of
 
Dutch who might cast disparagement upon the local idiom. Ironically, it is
 
precisely the abundance of non-standard forms in Pella Dutch which causes many
 
speakers to despair of any hopes for the language's survival, and,
 
consequently, to hasten its untimely demise through disuse. Quite the contrary,
 
however, the fact that such hybrid forms can evolve shows the linguist (who
 
recognize change as a universal of living languages) that Pella Dutch still
 
exhibits the potential for vitality.
 
Several attempts have, in fact, been made to resuscitate Dutch in Pella.
 
In the mid-1950s one of the members of a prominent family approached the
 
superintendent of the Pella Community Schools and persuaded him to initiate a
 
Dutch program. The parents's son happened to be in the class of Miss Dena
 
Versteeg, a teacher who, prior to her retirement in the early 1
970s, dedicated
 
over forty years of her life to public education. In addition to being a
 
beloved and respected teacher, Miss Versteeg was--and continues to be--regarded
 
as a precious human resource in our community for information on the local
 
Dutch tradition. Fluent in Dutch, she approached the instruction of the
 
language with a strong sense of concern for detail and correctness. I have had
 
conversations with persons involved with her program and all concur in giving
 
it high marks, at least from the pupils' point of view. From the
 
administrator's point
 
adjustments needed to
 
graders and wanted to
 
of view things were evidently less rosy. Scheduling
 
be made, especially for pupils who had begun as fifth
 
continue as sixth graders. At the end of the second year
 
of the program- the principal intervened and Dutch was dropped from the
 
curriculum.
 
In 1
978 Mrs. Harriet Zyistra, librarian and resources coordinator for the
 
Pella Christian Grade School (which offers instruction through eighth grade),
 
initiated an enrichment program in Dutch for seventh graders. Classes met twice
 
a week and used a variety of materials. Mrs. Zylstra had obtained a grant for
 
1
5
 
instructional materials from the Netherlands Ministry of Science and Education,
 
which provided her with a complete course in Dutch. Although the Dutch
 
materials were designed primarily for the younger children of guest workers in
 
the Netherlands, Mrs. Zylstra adapted them to the needs of her pupils. She
 
produced a small handbook of conversational Dutch based on the everyday
 
experiences of a traveler in the Netherlands, read from the New Testament in
 
today's Dutch (Groot Nieuws voor U), held memorization contests based on a
 
locally produced and recently reprinted volume Dutch Nursery Rhymes, and topped
 
off the year with a Dutch meal, at which occasion one had to speak Dutch in
 
order to be served.
 
Mrs. Zylstra combined an appreciation for formal correctness in language
 
instruction with a sensitivity to the potential of language as a transmitter of
 
cultural values. She has said that her "wish list" included the
 
identification —and, if necessary, production —of a rigorous, challenging
 
grammar, suited to the needs of an American seventh grader and geared toward
 
helping the pupil in both languages. But her real goal in teaching Dutch lies
 
not so much in facilitating fluency but in helping her pupils to "feel" like a
 
Dutchman and to share those feelings in the one language which has proven
 
itself capable of their expression.
 
(As an aside, one might mention the fact that Yankee Dutch--which is alive
 
and doing very well, thank you, in the Pella Community and Christian
 
Schools--consists primarily of English syntax and grammar with Dutch
 
vocabulary; the overwhelming majority of Yankee Dutch terms express a range of
 
feelings or social activities for which English has no single term. Some
 
examples are: suf (dull, lethargic, unable to get moving); benauwd
  
11
6
 
(constricted, stifled, oppressed, anxious); vies (
squeemish, finicky,
 
skittish); and knoeien around (mess around, make a mess, bungle, botch up). No
 
doubt many pupils came t
o Mrs. Zyistra with at least some idea of how it telt
 
to be a Dutchman).
 
Considering that she did her work without special released t
ime, Mrs.
 
Zylstra certainly deserves the commendation one hears from former pupils. By
 
1
980, however, it was clear that special scheduling considerations needed to be
 
made and the program was dropped at the end of its second year. I believe that
 
the Christian Grade School principal, Mr. Ivan Groothuis, is sincere in stating
 
that the reintroduction of Dutch would be a priority for any future program
 
revision. Time alone will tell if such is to be the case.
 
Still another language program was tried out in the late 1
960s with the
 
combined seventh and eighth graders at the Christian School in nearby Peoria,
 
Iowa (a community strongly identified with the Dutch-American territory
 
surrounding Pella). Mr. Robert De Jager, a native of the Netherlands and
 
principal-teacher of the seventh and eighth grade class, introduced Dutch.
 
After a while parents complained that pupils were putting too much energy into
 
Dutch at the expense of other subjects, and some seventh-grade pupils felt
 
disadvantaged being in the same class with eight graders who had studied Dutch
 
the year before. Scheduling and feasibility problems became apparent, and that
 
program too was dropped at the end of its second year.
 
Mr. De Jager is both versatile and resilient, however. Upon retirement
 
this educator-broadcaster-musician-preacher- craftsman moved to Pella. Here he
 
immersed himself even more fully than before in church and civic activities, in
 
1
7
 
his weekly Dutch-language radio program, and in a variety of educational
 
programs, particularly those of the Christian Opportunity Center (a
 
special-education and sheltered-workshop complex). At the same t
ime Mr. De
 
Jager quietly began tutoring Dutch. Without any particular advertisement b
e
 
worked with six pupils from four families since the autumn of 1
981. Some
 
measure of his success i
s the fact that all of his pupils but one are
 
continuing through the summer. Parents appear to be more than satisfied with
 
the instructor, whose lessons typically include not only grammar
 
expressions but also some religious text (a prayer, a verse from
 
Psalter, the retelling of a Bible story, or the text of a hymn).
 
and useful
 
the Dutch
 
The latter
 
I I
 
reflects the point made by Mr. De Jager during his interview that one of the
 
most useful aspects of language study in his own experience has been the
 
ability it has given him to get at the core meaning of Scripture by comparing
 
the way in which the same idea is expressed in several languages. One parent
 
remarking on De Jager's ability to relate well across generational lines noted
 
that he is "the sort of person every child should experience at least one," in
 
which I also sensed the parent's concern for the understanding and transmission
 
of religious values.
 
The reasons that pupils give for learning Dutch differ little from those
 
given by pupils in similar programs elsewhere: there is a desire t
o socialize
 
with members of the older generation, to come closer to one's roots, and to be
 
prepared for a more meaningful travel experience in the Netherlands. Even
 
though there is little overt movement toward the  realization of these goals,
 
both pupils and parents seem remarkably content with the results of the
 
language programs. I strongly suspect that language fluency per se is not the
 
real objective of the language classes. Rather, participation in the classes is
 
1
8
 
seen as a sign of affirmation of values which must now be transmitted to the
 
coming generation. Mrs. Schiebout, Sr., who is delighted with her
 
granddaughters'  language studies, was quite clear in stating that what she
 
wanted most for her grandchildren was the perpetuation of the religious
 
experience and a love of cleanliness. This does not mean that she is
 
indifferent to the language; it simply means that cultural components such as
 
the language are merely reflections of cultural values.
 
Another example of language-learning as affirmation of group values was
 
given by Mr. Gosselink the father of one of Mr. De Jager's pupils, who spoke at
 
length on the need for a special tie to, and respect for,  the Dutch heritage.
 
During his time in the military service Mr. Gosselink met members of another
 
Dutch-American community. While he was delighted to be able to communicate with
 
his ethnic peers, he regretted the fact that they were generally more fluent in
 
Dutch than he, and hence perhaps a bit closer to the older generation which was
 
more fully Dutch. Without being particularly adamant on the point, he hopes
 
that language instruction will give his children a chance to realize what he
 
would have wanted to experience through the language.
 
Among the reasons cited for giving one child Dutch lessons was the f
 
that she reportedly cried to learn that she was only half Dutch-American; the
 
child had already made the first statement of solidarity with the ethnic group
 
and should therefore be allowed to take the next logical step in affirming her
 
heritage and values. The point, of course, is not the charming story of the
 
child but rather the insight which it gives us into community attitudes. Among
 
other things, ethnic-heritage education becomes part of a rite of passage, and
 
1
9
 
the failure to recognize i
t as such and support it for its underlying value
 
would, as the extreme consequence, mean a deterioration of the ties which
 
contribute to group cohesiveness across generational lines.
 
Conclusions
 
It may well be that the future of heritage and language education will lie
 
t
o an ever-greater extent outside of formal school settings.
 In addition to
 
private language tutoring, there are several private and public cultural
 
initiatives which may assume more and more importance. One example is the Dutch
 
Family Singers and Dancers, which is a cooperative venture by a number of
 
families and individuals who practice Dutch songs and dances to be performed a
t
 
Tulip Time and on various occasions throughout the year. A small contingent
 
performed recently at the send-off ceremony for three students who had won free
 
trips to the Netherlands in an essay contest sponsored by the Pella Historical
 
Society. Several years ago the group traveled to Ames, Iowa to welcome the
 
members of the visiting Amsterdam Concertgebouw Orchestra. The group has been
 
active for nearly twenty years and counts among its members senior citizens,
 
entire families, couples, singles, and children whose parents are not members.
 
Practice sessions for the group are the only occasion on which I have observed
 
or experienced spontaneous socialization in Dutch with persons my age (mid- to
 
late thirties). While it is not overwhelmingly common, some join the group for
 
the express purpose of exposing their children to other persons who use the
 
Dutch language. Such was the case, for example, for the family of an active
 
member of the Christian Reformed Church and a leader in the Calvinist Cadet
 
20
 
Core (
Christian Reformed scout program). Though only in his early thirties, the
 
father of the family is an active speaker of Dutch who consistently greets me
 
in both Duccb and Engiish.

this year at the public library. But the iniative which holds the most promise
 
for maintaining a sense of Dutch heritage is that of instituting a "Board of
 
Dutch Education" in Pella. It is envisioned that such a group would help to
 
coordinate and centralize cultural transmission efforts such as those already
 
described and would address itself to matters of feasibility and follow-through
 
in those instances in which an instructor or program director needs assistance
 
or additional influence. The head of such a group would have to b
e an
 
individual (or governing committee) with considerable credibility and status.
 
Most importantly, however, that person would also need to have the ability to
 
bring together the community's many interests without favor or partiality. I
 
sincerely wish for Pella the realization of such hopes with as little delay as
 
possible.
