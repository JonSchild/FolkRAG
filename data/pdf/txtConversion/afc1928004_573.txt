SPEAK TO MY WIFE. 
Sang by NED BARRY with great success at HARRIGAN & H ART'S 
Theatre Comique, N. Y. 
There's a 
great and glorious time in store, 
For husbands one and all; 
For the wives are coming to the fore, 
And husbands singing small; 
The ladies mean to do the work, 
And so, in consequence; 
The men, all trouble mean to shirk, 
Oh! won't it be immense? 
SPOKEN,—And indeed, fellows ought to be grateful to 
the darlings for waking up to the fact, that the husbands 
have maintained the wives long enough, and now they 
mean to have a 
turn themselves. 
By jove! 
Won't it be 
immense? When the fellow comes for the Poor Rates, 
Water Rates, or any other Rates, to say, " Oh! If its cash 
you require, you must" 
CHORUS: 
Speak to Lucinda! 
Yes! speak to my wife! 
Speak to Lucinda! 
The pride of my life; 
She saves me all trouble, all bother and strife, 
So I 
beg that you'll speak to my wife. 
They'll have to take us out each day, 
To Concert, Ball, or Rout; 
They'll have to treat us to the play, 
To Oysters, " Cham." or Stout; 
The dears will have to find the cash, 
To meet each big expense; 
They'll pay the debts or " go to smash," 
Oh! won't it be immense? 
SPOREN.—Oh! bless them, they shall have Woman's 
Rights, and Woman's Responsibilities, and we fellows will 
stay at home and look nice, and, I 
say, won't it be immense 
to order carte blanche from the wine-merchant and cigar-
man, and, when they hint at a 
settlement of " the little 
account," to gently remark— 
(Chorus). 
4 
SPEAK TO MY WIFE. — CONTINUED. 
They'll drive us down in a 
Four-in-Hand, 
To the Derby, darling pets; 
And find us seats upon the stand, 
And lay us losing bets; 
We'll have new costumes ev'ry day, 
Regardless of expense; 
And the tailors' bills they'll have to pay, 
Oh! won't it be immense? 
SPOREN.—And when they particularly wish to take us 
anywhere, we will say, " Oh, No! really can't go; haven't 
a 
thing to wear." 
Then, perhaps, they'll remark, " But 
where's that sweet costume you wore yesterday?" And 
we will reply, " The idea, that thing! Why I've positively 
worn it twice." 
Oh! won't it be immense to have a 
new 
rig out from Poole for every possible occasion, with the 
definite understanding that he is to— 
(Chorus). 
To business they will go by train, 
Or on the 'bus will ride; 
And if it should come on to rain, 
They'll hare to go outside; 
A 
thousand things they'll have to do, 
To their disgust intense; 
And if it only does come true. 
Oh! won't it be immense? 
SPOKEN.—Ahl but I 
fear it is too good ever to come off. 
Nothing would suit me better than to change places with 
my wife, she to take the care and anxiety of the " head of 
the family," and I 
to live a 
life of luxurious ease at her 
expense. 
Just imagine, you know, if Chips, the Banker, 
wrote to say that there wasn't sufficient cash in hand to 
meet those little pieces of paper that are flying about with 
my autograph at the tail. 
Eh! I 
say! 
Won't it be im-
mense to write back and say, " Look here, old fellow, its 
not my affair at all. 
You must— 
(Chorus),

JOLLY GOOD LUCK TO ALL. 
Sang by NICD BARRY at HARRIGAN & HART'S Theatre Comique. 
Music published at E. 
H. 
HARDINGS, 229 Bowery. 
If I 
had the power a 
gift to bestow, 
On the friends that around me I 
see, 
I'd give them the very best gift that I 
know, 
The gift that they lucky should be; 
For no matter how clever, how foolish, how wise, 
No matter how great, or how small; 
By luck more than merit, we fall or we rise, 
So, here's jolly good luck to_us all. 
CHORUS: 
Here's jolly good luck to us all, my friends, 
The best of good luck to us all; 
For by luck more than merit, we rise or we fall, 
So, here's jolly good luck to us all. 
One man may be gifted with talents divine, 
But may still in obscurity live; 
While shallower mortals successfully shine, 
And take all the world has to give; 
One waits on in vain, for good fortune's caress, 
While the other some chance may befall; 
Which used to advantage results in success, 
So, here's jolly good luck to us all. (Chorus). 
So, up and be doing, deserving good luck, 
And good fortune may favor the brave; 
For some of life's prizes are won by sheer 
And are lost by the indolent slave; 
There is always one chance in the life of a 
man, 
Which, if lost, he can never recall; 
So work for it, watch for it, hope if you can, 
That there's jolly good luck for us all. (Chorus).

THE OLD FASHIONED HOME. 
Sang by NED BARRY at HARRIGAN & HART'S Theatre , Comign,.. 
Broadway, New York. 
There's an old fashioned house in the old country, 
There's an old fashioned couple live there; 
There's an old fashioned gate by the old country road. 
And an old fashioned man near the chair; 
An old fashioned woman is sitting there. 
Darning an old pair of hose; 
With her old fashioned cap on her old fashioned head 
And she's dressed in her old fashioned clothes. 
CHORUS: 
Hear those bells, those merry bells, 
And they fill my soul with a 
thrill; 
'Tis the old fashioned sound from them old fashioned bells, 
In that old fashioned church on the hill. 
There's an old fashioned clock on that old whitewashed 
wall, 
With its old fashioned pendulum and hands; 
There's an old wooden bench by that old fireplace, 
With its bright copper kettles and pans; 
An old fashioned man is sitting there, 
Smoking his old fashioned clay; 
With his old favorite dog sitting close by his side, 
Watching the children at play. 
heaven bless that dear old pair, may they live for man,). 
years, 
In that dear, little house in the lane; 
May they never know a 
care, but all happiness to slim L> 
And think of the dear, old happy days; 
The same I 
wish to you, with a 
heart of conscience true 
May you live, yes, for many, many years; 
May you never want for wealth, but enjoy the best 01 
health, 
It is the earnest wish I 
give to you.

OH! FRED, TELL THEM TO STOP. 
Written and composed by GEORGE M EEN. 
Sang by EDWIN BARRY. 
His latest hit. 
No doubt you have heard of the great fancy fair, 
That used to take place every day; 
Well, I 
thought for amusement I'd take my girl there, 
To pass a 
dull hour away; 
We went in you must know, and saw Barnum's show, 
Van Amburgh's menagerie, as well; 
There were round-about swings, and all kinds of things 
Forget the day I 
never shall. 
DIALOGUE.—Yes! when we got in the fair, my girl 
wanted to have a 
ride in the swing. 
I 
said, all right, my 
darling; but directly the swing went a 
little too high, she 
lustily cried— 
CHORUS: 
Oh, Fred, tell them to stop, 
That was the cry of Maria; 
The more she said whoa, they said, let it go, 
And the swing went a 
little bit higher. 
The people that stood round of course they all laughed 
But I 
only said, stop the swing; - 
There were four or five others in boats beside us, 
Saying, master don't do such a 
thing; 
Then four or five roughs caught hold of the ropes, 
Maria fell down on her knees; 
And one of them said, the young man's getting red, 
But isn't he having a 
spree. 
l)rALoouE.—And Maria still cried out at th e t
op 
of 
her 
voice—  
(Chorus). 
They soon stopped the swing, Maria jumped out, 
And quickly fell down on the floor; 
They brought her sonic water, which soon brought 
her to, 
The girl l 
now do adore; 
Should you ever go there, to the great fancy fair, 
Friends, take advice while I 
sing; 
Of the great round- about, it's the best fun that's out. 
And finish the day with a 
swing. 
DIALodt-E.—And when you take a 
girl with you, make 
her promise she won't call out— ( Chorus). 
SOMETHING TO TICKLE THE GIRLS. 
Written by A. 
W . 
FRENCH. 
Sang by EDWIN BARRY at the Theatre Comique. 
Music by T. B. KELLEY. 
The pet of the girls ev'ry where, 
Society calls me a 
wit; 
For nothing gets on unless there, 
I 
drop in to please them a 
bit; 
I've stories not few, and jokes that are new, 
As brilliant they tell me as pearls; 
Nonsense now and then is liked by all men, 
Of course it will tickle the girls. 
Someth_ng to tickle the girls, 
Laughing and shaking their curls; 
You'll not go amiss, I 
promise you this, 
With something to tickle the girls. 
• 
Some chaps they are terrible bores, 
Some spoony and dull as a 
hoe; 
No kind that a 
gay girl adores, 
She favors no one who is slow; 
Some fellows are shy, and others they try, 
To please when as crabbid as churls; 
I'm not either one, I 
can revel in fun, 
And can always tickle the girls. 
Then take my advice ev'ry one, 
And put it at once to the test; 
Go in with the girls and have fun, 
For that is just what suits them best; 
They like a 
gay heart, who does well his part, 
To cheer them as life swiftly whirls; 
-You're always their friend, to love and commend, 
With something to tickle the girls. 
(Chorus).

BABY DIED ONE YEAR AGO TO-DAY. 
Compliments of M. O'REARDON to NED BARRY, and sang by him with 
great success at the Theatre Comique, N. Y. 
Deep sadness fills my aching heart, 
And tears unbidden flow; 
For on this day my infant died, 
This day one year ago; 
A 
tender bud so beautiful, 
So fragile, pure and fair; 
Its fragrance far too sweet to waste, 
On earth's sin.tainted air; 
Through many sad, long hours of pain, 
My precious darling lay; 
Then God in sweet compassion took, 
My little one away; 
As cold and rigid in my arms, 
His lifeless form was placed; 
Such agony of soul then felt, 
Can never be effaced. 
CHORUS: 
Baby died one year ago to- day, 
Baby died one year ago to-day; 
Baby died, Baby died, 
Baby died one year ago to- day. 
In meek submission low, 
I 
bowed to God's allwise decree; 
lie only took unto himself, 
The one he gave to me; 
And yet I 
never see a 
babe, 
But scalding tears will start; 
And longingly I 
crave to clasp, 
My lost one to my heart; 
If I, my future home could choose, 
In realms where glory reigns; 
I'd ask to dwell with Angel babes, 
Ever singing Heavenly strains; 
For sadness fills my aching heart, 
And tears unbidden flow; 
For on this day my baby died, 
This day One year ago. 
BOYS, LEAVE DRINK ALONE! 
Written by JAMES LARKIN for NED BARRY, and sung by him with 
great success at the Theatre Comique, N. Y. 
Motto songs of every kind, 
Have through the world been sung; 
But I 
have one, the truest one, 
You'll say so when I'm done; 
A 
tale of woe I 
will unfurl, 
A. sad one you will own; 
You'll curse the day you saw the world, 
If you don't leave drink alone. 
CHORUS: 
Boys, leave drink alone, 
If happy you would live; 
Boys, leave drink alone, 
To you this good advice I 
give. 
Once I 
was a 
happy man, 
And had a 
loving wife; 
She said I'll do what I 
e'er can, 
if you quit the drunkard's life; 
The kind words that she gave to me, 
I 
hurl back in her face; 
Now those once happy lives we lived, 
We now must live apace. 
This is a 
tale I 
know that's true, 
As in the world you live; 
And in these lines I'll prove to you, 
The story that I 
give; 
You seem in doubt, you won't be long, 
'.V hen I 
tell ,-
on, you will sl art ; 
The tale that I 
told in this song, 
is from this broken heart. 
Sang originally by NED BARRY at Theatre Comique, Broadway, 
Music published at HARDINGS, Bowery. 
'Twas in the good ship Nancy Bell, 
We sailed for the Indian Sea; 
And there on a 
reef, we came to grief, 
Which often occurred to me, brave boys, 
Which often occurred to me; 
And pretty nigh all the crew were drowned, 
There were seventy-seven all told; 
And only ten of the Nancy's men, 
Cried here to the muster roll, brave boys, 
Said here to the muster roll. 
There was me and the cook and the captain bold, 
And the mate of the Nancy brig; 
A 
boatswain tight, and a 
midship's mite, 
And the crew of the captain's gig, brave boys, 
The crew of the captain's gig; 
For a 
month we'd neither victuals nor drink, 
Till hungry we did feel; 
So we drew a 
lot and accordingly shot, 
The captain for our meal, brave boys, 
The captain for our meal. 
The next lot fell to the Nancy's mate, 
And a 
delicate dish he made; 
Then our appetite with a 
midship's mite, 
We seven survivors stayed, brave boys, 
We seven survivors stayed; 
And the next of its eat was the boatswain tight, 
And he much resembled pig; 
And we victualed free, did the cook and me, 
On the crew of the captain's gig, brave boys, 
On the crew of the captain's gig. 
Then only me and the cook was left, 
And a 
delicate; which 
Of us two goes to the kettle, arose, 
And we argued it out as such, brave boys, 
We argued it out as such; 
For I 
loved that cook as a 
brother, I 
did, 
And the cook he worshipped me; 
But we'd both be blowed, if we'd either be stowed, 
In the other chap's hold, you see, brave boys, 
In the other chap's hold, you see.

OUR SAILORS ON THE SEA, 
Sang at HARRIGAN 8: HART'S Theatre Comique by 
MR. EDWIN BARRY. 
Music published and copyrighted by F. W. II ELbucK, 
Cincinnati, Ohio. 
At night when we are lying on 
Our beds, secure and warm, 
We hear the mourning winds that tell, 
The coming of the storm; 
The lightning flashed, the thunder roared 
Around its childish glee, 
On such a 
night may God protect 
Our sailors on the sea. 
On such a 
night may God protect 
Our sailors on the sea. 
Cnouus: 
Amidst the raging of the storm, 
We humbly ask of thee, 
Ohl Father, in thy mercy save 
• 
Our sailors oil the sea. 
Ohl Father, in thy mercy save 
Our sailors on the sea. 
The sailor little thinks, when he 
Lets out upon the wave, 
The worn-out ship in which he sails, 
May bear him to his grave; 
Should storm arise, her rotten planks 
To pieces soon may go; 
Yet shies like this are sent to sea, 
Th.tt man may richer grow. 
Yet ships like this are sent to sea, 
That man may richer grow. 
(Chorus1 
LA-DI-DA-DI-D00. 
Written by ARTHUR LLOYD. 
As Sung by NED BARRY at the THEATRE COMIQUE, N. 
Y. 
Perhaps you may have heard of Captain Ladidadidoo, 
Who for his Queen and Country all her enemies would 
slew; 
A 
British Soldier with a 
foe would fight till all was blue, 
And there's no exception, boys, in Captain Ladidadidoo. 
CHORE'S: 
Ladida, Ladidoo, fighting, slaughtering, my trade is, 
No doubt you all have heard of Captain Ladidadidoo; 
Ladida, Ladidoo, I'm the pet of all the ladies, 
The darlings love to flirt with Captain Ladidadidoo. 
Our soldiers in their uniforms are splendid men to view, 
But it's not alone the look because we know what they 
can do; 
I 
think we should be proud of them, I 
do, indeed, don't 
you? 
And their Officers, of course, including Captain Ladida-
didoo. ( Chorus). 
If I 
could go to Zululand, I'll tell you what I'd do, 
I'd be revenged on those who our courageous soldiers 
slew; 
For with my gleaming sword I'd run each savage Zulu 
through, 
And make them all remember Captain Ladidadidoo. 
(Chorus). 
The ladies are so fond of Captain Ladidadidoo, 
That upon my word I'm puzzled which delightful one to 
Woo ; 
But whoever I 
select, to her I'm certain to be true, 
She'll be a 
lucky girl who catches Ladidadidoo. 
(Chorus). 
I 
think you're glad to see me thus, you would be pleased 
I 
know, 
But I 
cannot stop much longer as I've somethiltg else to do 
I 
may see you again and so I 
will not say adieu, 
So ta ta, kind regards to all from Ladidadidoo. 
(Chorus). 
Sang originally in New York by EDWIN BARRY. 
The terrow fraught legend concerning the Flying Dutch-
man runs this: 
Vanderdecken is reported to have been a 
Dutch Captain 
entrusted with the conveyance of the Mai's from Holland 
to the Dutch settlement at the Cape. 
In one of his voy-
ages', when off Table Bay, he encountered a 
furious gale of 
wind, and for a 
long time was blown before it, during 
which all his attempts to enter the harbor were made in 
vain. 
His Mate, an experienced seaman, endeavored to 
persuade him to give over his fruitful struggles with the 
elements, and is reported to have received from him the 
reply, that he would beat about until the day of Judgment, 
which awful speech instantly brought upon him the pun-
ishment of Heaven. 
Consequently his doom. 
'Twos on a 
very stormy night, far Southward of the Cape, 
When from a 
huge Norwester we just made our escape; 
Like an infant in the cradle each breeze was hushed to sleep 
And peacefully we sailed along the bosom of the deep. 
(Repeat). 
At length the Helmsman gave a 
shout of horror and of 
fear. 
As if he'd just bad gazed upon some sudden danger near; 
We looked around the ocean, and just upon our lee, 
We saw the Flying Dutchman come bounding o'er the sea. 
(Repeat). 
THE FLYING DUTGILNIAN.—CoNTINUED. 
Take in your flowing canvas, boys, our watchful master 
cried, 
To us and our ship's company great trouble does betide; 
The billows crested white with foam, all angry doth appear, 
The wind springs up, a 
hurricane, for Vanderdechen's 
near. 
(Repeat). 
He comes, the Flying Dutchman, comes light o'er the 
lofty spray, 
Preceded by the tempest dire, be makes for Table Bay; 
With bird-like speed he booms across the wild and howl-
ing blast, 
But ere he can cast anchor there, the bay also is past. 
(Repeat). 
He speeds along too rapidly to mark his eagle 'light, 
And lightning lit, the Dutchman's helm full soon is out of 
sight; 
The crews of ships far distant, now shudder at the breeze, 
That bears dread Vanderdecken in fury o'er the seas. 
(Repeat). 
Then mourn for the Flying Dutchman, for terrible his 
doom, 
The ocean round the stormy cape it is his living tomb; 
There Vanderdecken beats about, forever, night and day, 
And tries in vain his oath to keep, by entering the bay. 
(Repeat).

BREACH OF PROMISE CASE. 
Sang by NED BARRY with great success at HARRIGAN & 
Theatre Comique, N. Y. 
Once I 
loved Matilda Minking, 
Once Matilda she loved me; 
Once we billed and cooed like winking, 
Once engaged to wed were we; 
Now all things are altered sadly, 
Our engagement's all U. P. ; 
Matilda served me, oh! so badly, 
Silly old Cupid's up a 
tree. 
SPOKEN.—lud I'm up a 
tree, too, for she who might 
have been my spouse, has made me pay for my broken 
vows, although— 
CHOKES: 
Once she loved me to distraction, 
Once she was beloved by me; 
Now she's gone and brought an action, 
Against her lover that used to be. 
Tilly in a 
shocking fashion, 
Flirted hard with ev'ry swell; 
Filling me with rage and passion, 
So one day I 
said " Farewell!" 
This, of course, raised Tilly's ire, 
Oh! you should have seen her face, 
Nothing at all would satisfy her, 
But a 
Breach of Promise Case. 
SPOKEN.—She said i 
had basely deserted her, but no! 
she would not be trampled upon with impunity, (as if I 
wanted to trample on her with anything at all). 
She had 
three hundred and forty-nine love letters of mine, and 
damages she would have. 
Oh! the inconsistency of woman. 
She said she was injured and yet she wanted further dam-
ages. 
She hated the sight of me, although— 
(Chorus), 
17 
BREACH OF PROMISE CA.SE.—CONTINUED. 
The case was tried, the Court was quite full, 
Everybody was there to see; 
They seemed to think the fun delightful, 
Sport to them was death to me; 
Tilly's lawyer to the jury, 
Bullied me beyond all bounds; 
The verdict was, oh! rage and fury, 
Damages, just one thousand Pounds. 
SPOKEN.—Oh, only a 
thousand; that's all. 
I 
could for-
get that, and forgive Tilly, but never can I 
forgive that 
odious lawyer of hers, Jawkins, Q. C. 
Not content with 
calling me villain, forger, burglar, assassin and other mild 
epithets, he added injury to insult by reading my letters to 
the jury. 
This is one of them: 
My own Angelic Darling: 
I 
cannot retire to my lonely couch without once more 
pouring out to you the devotion of this heart that beats for 
thee, and thee alone, my beautiful, my own. 
Oh! what a 
paradise was ours as we stood upon the doorstep this 
evening, oblivious of all save love. 
No! No! I 
cannot re-
tire to my lonely couch. 
I 
will watch o'er thee; the door-
step on which we stood shall be my couch, the scraper 
pressed by your seraphic boot, shall be my pillow. 
Sleep 
on! 
He read that, and everybody laughed. 
Oh! I 
could 
smother him! I 
was so upset, that when the Judge asked 
me a 
question, I replied- (Chorus). 
Now I'm in a 
pretty pickle, 
With the cash I've had to pay; 
My Matilda false and fickle, 
Weds another man to- day; 
So ev'ry swain whom Cupid fetters, 
My advice should take I 
think; 
And always write their spooney letters, 
In Anti-Breach of Promise Ink. 
SPOKEN.—Yes, gentlemen! 
Whenever you write love 
letters, always be careful to use the Anti- Breach of Prom-
ise Ink, which fades away in a 
week or two after it is 
written. 
If you do this, you will never have occasion to 
say with me— (Chorus).

Good people I 
ask you to listen, 
And heed what I 
say in my song; 
Common sense is the best kind of tutor, 
It teaches us right from wrong; 
There's two ends you know to a 
string, boys, 
So be careful when you fly your kite; 
Have a 
care she don't go to high in the air, 
That's where I 
know you are right. 
0110EUS: 
Fair play is a 
jewel we must dearly prize, 
Be impartial, my boys, in a 
fight; 
You must always believe what you see with your eyes, 
That's where I 
know you are right. 
Whenever you go on a 
picnic, 
Enjoy yourself, have lots of sport; 
Take your girl, your father and mother, 
Good lager beer, sherry and port; 
Don't stand still and look like a 
Quaker, 
Be merry, cheerful and bright; 
And when there's a 
dance, bounce in for a 
ebanco 
And that's where I 
know you are right. 
CHORUS: 
For it's pleasure, my boys, that keeps us alive, 
So ( ro in for fun both day and night; 
Laugh a 
A grow fat, don't look sick like a 
cat, 
And that's, where I 
know you are right. 
THAT'S WHERE I KNOW YOU ARE RIGHT. 
Continued. 
If you're wise enough to save money, 
And send all your children to school; 
The world will call yoq a 
miser, 
Just kick against the world like a 
mule; 
For when you are aged and decrepid, 
From hard work take a 
respite; 
Then you can say I'm dry, on a 
wet day, 
That's where I 
know you are right. 
CHORUS: 
For money, you know, makes the mare go, 
Don't be stingy, greedy or tight; 
You can be a 
good fellow without being a 
fool, 
And that's where I 
know you are right. 
Should you marry a 
bad tempered woman, 
One who could give you a 
look; 
That would send you away out in the kitchen, 
To wash, to scrub and to cook; 
Oh! tie up your things in a 
bundle, 
Escape from your room in the night; 
As a 
matter, of course, take a 
sudden divorce, 
And that's where I 
know you are right, 
CHORUS: 
If your brute of a 
husband gets tight, 
Lock him up in a 
room, 
Club him with a 
broom, 
And that's where I 
know you are right.

THE MAID AND THE MAGPIE. 
Sang by NED BARRY With great success in HARRIGAN & HART'S 
New Play, " Mulligan Guards' Nominee," , 
Theatre Cornique, N. Y. 
:0: 
Now once there was a 
maid kept an old magpie, 
And a 
parson who prayed lived very close by; 
When this maid met the parson they both stopped to talk, 
And often on the quiet go for a 
cosy walk; 
But her lover was a 
sailor who sailed across the main, 
And he promised she should be his wife when he returned 
again; 
Still she let this parson see her home from church, 
And kiss her, never thinking of the magpie on the perch. 
CHORITS: 
The maid and the magpie would talk all the day, 
The maid would believe all the magpie would say; 
She said I 
love the parson, don't you tell the tar, 
When the old magpie only said " guar! quar!" 
Now, whilst this sailor was away, so the story gOes, 
This maid flirts with the parson, but, of course, nobody 
knows; 
Until she tells the magpie when talking one day, 
She'd rather have the parson now the sailor was away; 
But she said don't tell this secret, or I'll give you the birch 
Every night at nine, I 
meet the parson near the church; 
The magpie only guar, quar'd as he had done before, 
But he meant to tell the sailor boy when he returned on 
shore. 
(Chorus), 
21 
THE MAID AND THE MAGPIE.—CONTINITED. 
Whilst stationed at Gibraltar, this sailor, so it seems, 
When sleeping in his cosy bunk, he had some funny dreams; 
He dreamt the girl he'd left behind on dear old England's 
shore, 
Would, whilst he was away, flirt with half a 
dozen more; 
So he made his passage homeward as quickly as could be, 
Landed safely at her house, but no maiden could he see; 
He then talked to the magpie who was dancing on the perch, 
And the magpie told him all about the parson at the church. 
(Chorus). 
Now when the sailor met the maiden, he passed her with 
disdain, 
So she sued for breach of promise, tried five hundred to 
obtain; 
But he brought the magpie into court, which told the 
truthful tale, 
So to get what she required, this maiden did fail; 
She then went for the parson, but in vain for him did 
search, 
For he knew which way the wind blew, so he hooked it 
from the church; 
The lawyers couldn't find him, so the case went on the 
shelf, 
And this tricky little maiden had to live by herself. 
CHORUS: 
The maid and the magpie ne'er talk all the day, 
For the jolly little sailor took the knowing bird away; 
And now with all his shipmates, this rare good hearted tar, 
While the magpie tells the truthful tale, he sings " guar! 
guar!"

You'll find You're the Winner in the End. 
Sang by NED BARRY at the THEATRE COMIQUE, N. 
Y. 
Air—True as Steel. 
All this life is but a 
race, of men to gain a 
place, 
Of wealth, destruction, and a 
happy home; 
Some may come in away behind, but you'll very often 
find, 
That many a 
noble man is left alone; 
But my advice to all my friends to-night, 
Although you're poor, look manly, stern and bright; 
Love your neighbor as you ought, and when life's 
battle's fought, 
You'll find that you're the winner in the end. 
It was just eight years ago, on a 
night of storm and 
snow, 
When a 
beggar, thinly clad, stood on the street; 
A 
rich Banker passes by, but stopped at that sad cry, 
Of a. penny, just to buy some bread to eat; 
Does he help him as he should, I 
ask of you, 
No! he scorns him just as rich men often do; 
And the beggar with a 
sigh, says my time is by-and-by 
And he'll find that I'm the winner in the end. 
Now the years have past and gone, and the subject of 
my song, 
I 
will prove, if you will listen for a 
while; 
Now the Banker he is poor, even riches are not sure, 
And the Beggar he has riches, wealth and style; 
With cold and bitter hunger, nearly dead, 
The Banker asks the Beggar for some bread; 
And the pityful cry is heard, he gives him money with 
the words, 
You have found that I'm the winner in the end. 
Now in this, our glorious town, as I've very often found 
There's a 
hundred just such cases every day; 
Gold is all you need, you'll find, to prosper bear in mind 
It's the king of all the nation people say; 
Our country's been ill trouble near and far, 
Peace and honesty seems like a 
distant star; 
We'll reform and dour best, with victory on our crest, 
You'll find we'll be the winners in the end.

FRITZ MCGINNIS& 
Dutch character song. 
Words and music by Edwin Talbot, 
and sung with great success by George Murphy, of 
Murphy and Shannon. 
1 
am a 
German of great fame : 
Fritz McGinniss dots my 
name ; 
I 
invented ice cream and doughnuts you can bet, 
Also Irish lager beer that makes you get off on your ear. 
If you take a 
bath I 
know that you'll get wet. 
I 
walked across the water with Jake Aberlee's big daughter, 
And anchored on the bottom for a 
week : 
I 
walked seven miles in eighty-seven different styles, 
And at the Paris Exposition took the prize for cheek. 
CHORUS. 
My chest-protector I 
did break while whistling for the cake. 
I 
had corns and bunions growing on my ear. 
I 
wrote the Pinafore in 1864, 
And Julius Ctesar tried to give me the queer. 
I 
used to dance upon my nose sing also through my toes 
In Jerusalem when I 
discovered Israelites, 
I 
swallowed up a 
cafe, chewed the hinges of a 
safe, 
And danced a 
seven octave jig in iron tights. 
I 
was preserved in ink with Darwin's missing link 
That was behind a 
tea-store chromo on the wall, 
In the White House took the prize for telling political lies, 
And played poker with Romeo and 3 
uliet for a 
ball, 
Also squeezing smoke from pure Havana coke, 
1 
discovered Coney Island in a 
gale 
When Moses used to preach to the sheenies on the beach 
I 
stabbed his sisters with my big toe- nail.

IF WE HAD THE CHANCE AGAIN. 
Sang by NED BARRY at Theatre Comique, N. Y. 
Air—All that Glitters is not Gold. ' 
•o: 
In this cruel world we live in, strange things we often 
see, 
Its motto you will find is wealth, no matter where 
we be; 
If a 
man is rich, you'll always find he's a 
score of 
friends, 
While the poor man for his living, on his labor he 
depends; 
Can't we try and help the needy, and relieve their 
anxious pain, 
And not say, well, we'll do it if we have the chance 
again. 
Now, this nation is a 
great one, at least so people say, 
But, it seems to me, and you'll agree, it's dropping 
every day; 
The Indian War you've heard of, where noble Custer 
fell, 
And in his band not one was left the story for to 
tell; 
In Spain they slaughtered our soldiers, and the news 
from the army came, 
We'd avenge the Virginius and Ouster, if we had 
the chance. again. 
25! 
IF WE HAD THE CHANCE AGAIN—CoNTINuED. 
Now the Winter's been a 
hard one, for the rich as wel 
as poor, 
But better times are coming, boys, of it I 
feel quite 
sure; 
We've bad trouble' with our Elections, we have now, 
perhaps, done well, 
I'll speak of neither party, but wait for time to tell; 
There is one though, I 
will boast of, with a 
true and 
honest aim, 
And we'd elect old Abraham Lincoln if we had the 
chance again. 
We have often thought, in sorrow, of lives so good and 
kind, 
Who helped the weary beggar, and left his name 
behind; 
lie was murdered, and his murderer stands a 
free man 
now to-day, 
And it often makes me wonder if a 
jury will take 
pay; 
You've heard of him, I'm certain, his money flowed 
like rain, 
And we'd give Jim Fiske a 
bumper, if we had the 
chance again.

Edwin Barry's " Whoa, Emma!" 
Written by T. S. LONSDALE, and sung by EDWIN BARRY. 
Some folks call me a 
Laundress, 
Soap-suds, Old Starch and Blue, 
Because I'm a 
Good Templar— 
And take in washing, too ; 
They all may call me names like that— 
Or anything they choose, 
If they will only stop my wife 
From going on a " booze." 
SPOKEN— But that is quite impossible, I'm afraid—she has 
a 
kind and indulgent husband—and all he says to her is— 
CHORUS. 
Oh, Emma! Whoa, Emma! 
Emma, this will never do 
Whoa, Emma! Oh, Emma! 
Emma, I'm ashamed of' you. 
One time she was quite temperate, 
Just sip a 
glass of wine, 
Whenever we had friends around 
At good old Christmas time. 
But now she drinks just like a 
fish, 
(In fact just like a 
whale). 
If you should ask her what she'll take, 
SPOKEN—She'll reply, " I 
don't mind; anything will do—, 
just— 
A 
small drop in a 
pail."

SPOKEN—I 
would let her swim in it at home—but when 
she goes out in the street, and lies down in the road— 
Oh, Emma ! &c. 
Each morning she is up by six, 
And flies off to the " Pub," 
Before she does a 
stroke of work, 
Or gives the clothes a 
rub. 
When she returns, of course I'm up, 
And all our children straight, 
But she is always out again 
Before the clock strikes eight, 
SPOKEN—To 
have another half pint; and when she returns 
I, like a 
fond and affectionate husband, say— 
Oh, Emma! &c. 
Our business it will go to smash 
If she don't turn me up, 
I'll keep no home or laundry, 
But drink the " bitter cup," 
And go and sell the furniture, 
While I've the privilege, 
And with the coin I'll have a 
day, 
Likewise I'll break the pledge. 
SPOKEN—I'll get gloriously inebriated myself and join the 
old lady, and as we go along arm in arm, we can both say— 
Oh Emma! & c,

Hundred Years Ago. 
Written by CHARLES ARCHER, expressly for, and sung by, EDWIN BARRIO 
with great success. 
The songs and poems ev'ry night, 
You hear upon the stage; 
Some artists sing and some recite, 
Of every clime and age. 
So, if the favor you'll confer 
Attention to bestow; 
I'd like to speak of the men that were, 
One hundred years ago. 
CHORUS. 
A hundred years ago, 
A 
hundred years ago. 
I'd fain refer to the men that were 
One hundred years ago. 
Sweet Erin's famous to this day 
For whiskey, love and mirth ; 
'Tis the home of hospitality, 
That gave St. Patrick birth. 
The home of Robert Emmet true, 
And O'Connell, well, we know, 
That Irish patriots wern't so few

Old England had her heroes brave, 
Whose names shall ever stand, 
With gallant Nelson on the wave, 
Lord Wellington on land. 
And France can boast Napoleon, too, 
Cambrou with hair like snow, 
And Ney who fought at Waterloo, 
Near a 
hundred years ago. 
A 
hundred years ago, & c. 
America should ne'er forget 
The men she held so dear ; 
Thank God their names are living yet, 
And will for many a 
year. 
Mad Anthony Wayne, and General Lee, 
The terror of the foe ; 
General Washington, none great as he, 
One hundred years ago. 
A 
hundred years ago, &c. 
The trials of that gallant band, 
I 
need not stop to tell; 
They struggled hard, they freed the land, 
And the flag we love so well. 
The stars and stripes shall ever wave, 
Nor ever be laid low; 
While we've men as true, and hearts as brave, 
As one hundred years ago.

A 
Quiet Little Home. 
Originally sung at Harrigan & Hart's Theatre Comique, Broadway, 
by EDWIN BARRY. 
I 
lead a 
very homely life in a 
quiet sort of way, 
I 
like well to enjoy, and not feel over gay; 
Fast life does not agree with me at any time or place, 
I've traveled nearly through this world at quite a 
quiet pace. 
CIIORUS. 
A 
quiet little home in a 
quiet little way, 
A 
quiet little wife sitting quiet all the day, 
A 
quiet little parlor, a 
quiet cup of tea, 
A 
life of peace and quietness, that's the life for me. 
I 
like to have my social sing, I 
like my pipe and glass, 
I 
love my wife, I 
love my friends with whom the time to pass; 
A 
reasonable hour to rest, an early hour to rise, 
'Twill make a 
man both healthy, wealthy, prosperous and wise. 
A 
quiet little home, &c. 
So now, my friends, take my advice, and do the best you can 
To earn a 
name that will become an honest working man; 
Study the comforts of your home, and very soon you'll find 
life of peace and quietness is best suited to the mind.

What Are You Up To, Jane? 
Sung by the Great Motto Vocalist, EDWIN BARRY; at Harrigan Ct. 
Theatre Comique, Broadway, L' 
Mother Jones kept a 
snug iItt,e grocery store. 
Mother Jones ;vas obnoxious and plain, 
blother Jones had a 
daughter both pleasing and fair, 
Whose sweet appelation was Jane. 
While the old one was serving tobacco or gin, 
I'd court pretty Jane on the sly, 
And oh, what sweet, glorious moments we'd have, 
Until the old woman would cry— 
CHORUS. 
What are you up to, Jane ? 
What are you up to, Jane? 
I 
never knew such a 
girl in my life, you're up to your mis-
chief again, 
What are you up to, Jane? now what you up to, Jane ? 
I 
never knew such a 
girl in my life, you're up to your mis-
chief again. 
One day I 
said, Jane, would you like to be married ? 
I 
fancy I 
should, said she, 
So one fine morning we bolted away, 
And got married upon the " Q. T." 
We went down to Rockaway, as Jane preferred 
The seaside for the honeymoon tour, 
Out at night we'd a 
fright as I 
pat out the light, 
A 
knock came at the bedroom door. 
SYOKEN.—And a 
voice through the key-hole said— 
What are you up to, Jane ? &c. 
Mother Jones was too late, for the bridal knot 
Was safely and securely tied, 
For ten years more from my mother-in-law, 
I 
kept at a 
distance wide. 
But she turned up again a 
few days ago, 
When we startled the old 'uns curls, 
With a 
great surprise for her dear old eyes. 
When we mustered the boys and girls. 
SPOKEN.— AS 
our " blessings " came into the room two-
by- two, like a 
healthy boarding-school, the " old 'Ina ' dropped 
gracefully into the nearest coal scuttle, exclaiming— 
What are you up to Jane? &c.

The Tar's Farewell. 
Sung by Email BARRY. 
• 
When forced to bid farewell to Loo, 
Pull away, my boys, pull away, 
I 
did not know what I 
should do, 
Pull away, pull away. 
'I left her weeping on the quay, 
She said she would be true to me, 
As we sailed away to the Southern sea; 
Pull away, my boys, pull away. 
CHORUS. 
For the wind must blow, and the ship must go, 
And loving souls must part, 
For the ship will tack, and the tar come back 
To the first love of his heart. 
(Repeai.) 
But then, if false should prove my fair, 
Pull away, my boys, pull away, 
I'd burn this little lock of hair, 
Pull away, pull away. 
If she be false and I 
be free, 
I'll sail again to the Southern sea, 
Where there are plenty as good as she, 
Pull away, my boys, pull away. 
For the wind must blow, &c. 
Paddle Your Boat Along. 
Sung with great success by EDWIN BARRI% 
This world we live in is just like the sea, 
Travelers over its waters are we ; 
Try to be happy where'er you may be, 
If the wind should blow steady and strong. 
It's no use to grumble, to growl or complain, 
You can't stop the wind nor you can't stop the rain, 
After a 
storm we have sunshine again--
. 
So paddle your boat along. 
CHORUS. 
Always try to be happy and gay, 
Let this world jog on as it fnay; 
Always do right and never do wrong, 
As you paddle your boat along. 
There are people we meet who always seem glad, 
Others who always seem solemn and sad. 
They want all the good but won't share the bad ; 
Now I 
think that decidedly wrong. 
There are good things enough in this world for us all; 
If we be content with a 
share of the small, 
Tho' little our lot, some have nothing at all, 
So paddle your own boat along. 
Always try to be happy, &c. 
Don't be down-hearted, though breakers may roar, 
Or if your boat be cast on the shore; 
You are sure to get into smooth water once more 
If you pull steady and strong. 
Don't pull too slow nor yet pull too fast, 
But always make way for a 
friend to get past. 
The harbor of safety you'll reach well at last, 
If you paddle your boat along. 
Always try to be happy, &c.

Always Speak a 
Kind Word when you Can. 
Sung by EDWIN BARRY, at Harrigan & Hart's Theatre Cornique, amnio 
roars of applause. 
Strange sayings are the rage, on the stree'i and on the stage, 
And many glorious maxims you will find; 
Hut there's one more than the rest 
Seems to linger in my breast, And very oft comes stealin,; 
o'ermy mind ; 
I'll sing a 
song to-night of a 
motto true and bright, 
A 
lesson it conveys sublime and grand, 
To the beggar at your door, or to anyone that's poor, 
Always speak a 
good and kind word when you can. 
Now there's many a 
man, who great riches does command, 
But his praises and his honors they are small ; 
But when he's dead and gone, they will speak of him and 
mourn, 
And say how good that he has been to all. 
And vhile upon this earth, struggling hard through life, 
No one would assist him in his plans ; 
lint the stories they relate when they know it is too late, 
For they never speak a 
kind word when they can. 
The workingman to-day with his poor and scanty pay, 
Striving very hard his family to maintain ; 
While the rich they stay at home with the riches that they own. 
The poor may ask assistance all in vain. 
When humble is your lot in the wretched laborer's cot, 
Don't pass them by, but take them by the hand, 
Don't turn your head away, but remember what I 
say, 
Always speak a 
good and kind word when you can. 
Good Bye Polly. 
Sung with great success by EDWIN BARRY at the Theatre Comique. 
I 
loved a 
girl named Polly, and thought that she loved me, 
So joined a 
ship to take a 
trip across the briny sea, 
And when the morning had arrived for me to sail away, 
I 
gave the lass a 
parting kiss, and then to her did say; 
35 
CHORUS. 
Good bye Polly, I 
must leave you, 
Let us hope the parting will not grieve you, 
The ship it sails to-day, some thousand miles away; 
So think of me when I 
am on the sea. 
She vowed that she'd be true to me while I 
was away, 
And thinking what she said was right, I 
left her my half pay; 
Then with a 
sigh bid her good-bye, and as they heaved the lead, 
I 
left her standing on the shore, then jumped aboard and said; 
Good bye, Polly, &c. 
I 
saw her in my dreams at night, I 
thought of her all day, 
But did not think that she was false to me, when far away; 
For I 
must own when I 
alone, was lying on my bed, 
I 
often woke up in a 
fright, and these words have said: 
Good bye, Polly, &c. 
Some years had passed when I 
returned, with lots of gold 
in store, 
And Just you fancy my surprise, when I 
knocked at the door. 
They told me Poll was married, she had been false to me, 
So now no more I'll stay on shore, I'm off again to sea. 
Good bye, Polly, &c.

Broadway, N. Y. 
When Tom declared his ardent love for Miss Amelia Brown, 
They asked papa to give consent, but he only gave a 
frown; 
Now Tom and his Amelia said that they'd elope to town, 
And married be, although it was against the wish of Brown , 
The very morning, of their flight, old Brown at home would stay, 
I 
know they only wished for some good chance to run away. 
SPOKEN— I 
knew the boy loved the girl, and the old man 
didn't love the girl worth a 
cent. 
The old man was a 
kind 
of sporting man, and so I 
says, Brown, old boy, I 
want to lay 
you a 
wager. 
What is IL 
? 
says Brown. I 
want to bet you 
five dollars you can't swing your arm with the pendulum of 
that clock five minutes. Done ! says he, I 
take the bet. What 
have I 
got to do ? 
All you have got to do is to follow me and 
aro like this— 
CHORUS. 
Here she goes and there she goes, 
Bib- a-de-bob, bib- a-de-bob, 
Here she goes and there she goes, 
And that is the way to do it. 
Old Brown he set to work at once and soon began to puff, 
I 
cried old Brown, I 
think you'll soon say you've had enough ; 
I 
never laid a 
bet, said he, but what I 
mean to win, 
T 
bet another ten, said he, that I 
will not give in, 
Continued. 
Old Brown was fat, the weather warm, and never once he 
stopped, 
And there upon his heated face there stood the shining drops. 
SPOKEN—And I 
stood in the corner laughing; and old 
Brown still kept up the same old game— 
Here she goes, &c. 
Mrs. Brown who heard me laugh, came into the room to see; 
Oh ! goodness gracious, Brown, said she, what can the mat-
ter be ? 
Why, Brown, you must be going mad, of that there is no doubt, 
To stand in front of that old clock and swing your arms about; 
I'll go and fetch the doctor, Brown, if you go on this way, 
But all they could get out of. Brown, and this is what he'd 
say— 
Old Brown he won the wager, but lost his daughter by the 
game, 
She married Tom in town that day, and back for forgiveness 
came; 
'Twas useless when the job was done for Brown to then 
say nay, 
So he took the joke, my friends, in quite a 
jolly way ; 
I 
le gave a 
party to his friends and oftimes tells with glee, 
While sounds of laughter echo from the jolly company. 
SPOKEN—Yes, says the old man, I 
shall never forget the 
time I 
went— 
Here she goes,

I'll Bet You a 
Dollar You Don't, 
Sung with great success by EDWIN BARRY. 
Does any one know what I'm going to say ? 
I'll bet you a 
dollar you don't. 
If I 
lose the wager, will any one pay, 
I'll bet you a 
dollar you don't. 
Gay bachelors say they shall never take wives, 
For as each in his way to be happy contrives, 
They mean to keep single the rest of their lives. 
But I'll bet you a 
dollar they don't. 
Find an Irish election without any row, 
I'll bet you a 
dollar you don't, 
Or a 
sirl who objects to a 
mistletoe bough, 
I'll bet you a 
dollar you don't. 
Some years of experience teaches me this— 
That from seven to ninety both Mrs. and Miss 
May refuse you this ancient excuse for a 
kiss. 
But I'll bet you a 
dollar they don't. 
You may see vaccination a 
thing of the past, 
I'll bet you a 
dollar you don't. 
And heavy taxation abolished at last, 
I'll bet you a 
dollar you don't. 
You may see old John Bull dwindle down to a 
calf 
And his provender nothing but foreigners' chaff. 
You may see all the ladies too quiet by half, 
But I'll bet you a 
dollar you don't. 
Some ignorant croakers wear visages long, 
Will you bet me a 
dollar they don't ? 
And say that to visit amusement is wrong, 
Will you bet me a 
dollar they don't ? 
Though to succor distress they can never afford, 
Above human vices they always have soared, 
Still somehow they know every move on the board, 
Will you bet me a 
dollar they don't? 
A 
married man often tries to prove cock-o'- the-walk, 
But I'll bet you a 
dollar he don't. 
If he tries to sleep when his wife wants to talk, 
I 
shall bet him two dollars he don't. 
So all you young girls, please attend to this verse, 
And go and get married for better or worse, 
And two little armfuls you may have to nurse, 
Won't bet a 
dollar you don't,

Allow me to See you Home. 
Sung by EDWIN BARRY at the Theatre Comique, New Yon( 
They say I'm a 
desperate flirt, 
A 
gay and a 
festive young man; 
I 
admit it and boldly assert 
I 
will have all the pleasure I 
can ; 
I 
admire pretty faces and feet, 
And whenever chance leads me to roam, 
If a 
sweet pretty girl I 
snould meet, 
I 
insist upon seeing her home. 
CHORUS. 
Allow me to see you home, 
That is if I 
don't intrude, 
No matter how far, so pretty you are, 
I 
hope you'll not think that I'm rude: 
Oh do let me see you home 
You sweet little scrumcious maid, 
You've nothing to fear you sweet little dear, 
Come along and don't be afraid. 
Sometimes the fair creatures say " yes I" 
And often decidedly " no ;" 
'Tis then I 
endeavor to press, 
Until they allow me to go; 
Then I 
secretly wonder how far, 
Sometimes it's a 
duced long way, 
I 
then think what fools we men are! 
But still I 
continue to say 
Allow me to see you home, &c. 
One night I 
was had for a 
mark 
And felt just a 
little bit small, 
'Twas a 
girl that I 
met in the Park, 
A 
beautiful figure so tall; 
She allowed me to stand her champagne, 
And pay for a 
cab to her door, 
Then advised me to run home again 
As she did'nt want anything more. 
SPOKEN.— Pretty thing to tell a 
fellow after standing supper, 
paying cab fare eight and a 
half miles; told me to run home 
again; bounced in and shut the door in my face. 
I 
declared 
that should be the last girl I 
should see home, but I 
scarcely 
got twenty yards from the house when I 
met another fair 
creature. 
I 
said " Ahem, rather late to be alone, miss." 
No answer, so I 
raised my hat and said, " I 
beg pardon miss 
but— 
Allow me to see you home, &c.

A Cunundrnm I Can Hardly 
Understand. 
higinally sung by W ILL H . M ORTON, America's Comique, at the 
Holiday Street Theatre, Baltimore, Md. 
This world's a 
mighty riddle, very difficult to solve, 
Is a 
maxim that you'll hear on every side, 
It's a 
game of cards in fine, although money's lost and won; 
While struggling both with poverty and pride, 
For instance there's the poor man that la')ors for his 
bread, 
When trials and want assail his every hand, 
Where's the money that's been paid to assist him I'm 
afraid 
Is a 
conundrum I 
can scarcely understand. 
This nation is a 
great one, at least so people say, 
But there's fishes in the sea that ain't bePn caught, 
And the style that we've been ruled, plainly tells us 
we've been fooled, 
Even Congressmen ain't honest as they aught, 
But still many things that in our memory rings, 
Of men whose lip and purposes were grand, 
Why Boss Tweed died in prison, while his partners they 
went free, 
Is a 
conundrum I 
can scarcely understand. 
You have heard it doubtless said that a 
fool is easy led, 
it's a 
saying that is sometimes very true, 
But curious to relate how in these United States 
There's a 
class of men known by most of you, 
I 
mean actors that are bad, there are hundreds to be had, 
Yes, a 
thousand waiting if you should conunand, 
With the salary managers give, how in heaven's name 
they live, 
Is a 
conundrum I 
can scarcely understand. 
Only the Way on the Stage. 
Composed by FRED. J. M ACKLEY and sung by H ENRY GRAHAM 
If you will listen to me, some facts I 
will mention, 
Concerning the past and the present strange age, 
And in them, my friends, to you I'll relate 
Some things I 
saw one night and played on the stage: 
I 
came to this city with one or two friends, 
And went for a 
stroll, they seemed quite amazed, 
When we read on the bills of the Bowery Theatre, 
And found a 
new drama was played on the stage. 
The first scene I 
saw was a 
street in New York, 
There a 
poor woman begging, she quite old in age, 
Those sad means she tried to keep her from starving, 
A 
very sad lesson of life's book a 
page; 
But a 
policeman passed by, his face seemed all smiles, 
Placed his hand in his pocket and drew forth his wages, 
And he gave part to help this poor wretched woman, 
But ' twas only the way it was played on the stage. 
The scene it then changed from a 
street to a 
court room, 
There a 
prisoner on trial for a 
crime very sad, 
he'd murdered a 
man, by the people respected, 
And the court room was crowded with people so glad 
To see that man punished for the crime he committed. 
The jury looked stern, and the judge in a 
rage, 
And they hung that ,rich man for the murder of Fisk, 
But it was only the way it was played on the stage. 
In the next scene I 
saw a 
clergyman _rom Brooklyn, 
Who was dancing a 
hornpipe, and seemed quite the rage, 
Another one from Jersey was playing the violin, 
The audience in front with wonderment gazed ; 
For just at that minute a 
party named Tilton 
Then gave a 
fine sermon on the morals of the age, 
And I 
thought that they practiced each sermon they preached, 
But It was only the way it wrs played, on the stage. 
41 
Of all the strangest girls on earth, 
I 
think my girl's the one; 
You know she has peculiar ways, 
And quite devoid of fun. _ 
She never sees a 
joke of mine, 
Whenever humor flows, 
But gives me a 
disdainful look 
And quite turns up her nose. 
SPOKEN—Some girls like a 
little joke, you know, but mini 
don't, she turns her nose up at it. 
I 
think she works it on 
the same principle as this (
turning tip nose with finger). 
CHORUS. 
Some girls do, and some girls don't, 
Some girls will, but my girl won't; 
I 
tried very hard to see if she would, 
She said she really couldn't, and I 
don't think she could 
I 
took my love to see the play, 
As other fellahs do; 
And thought that she'd enjoy herself, 
She cried the whole night through. 
And when we reached the street again, 
Some oysters I 
proposed, 
But she said, " No, not me, young man," 
Still turning up her nose. 
SPOKEN—Up 
it went again at three dozen of flm best 
Saddle Rocks, just think of that. 
To see a 
girl turn up het 
nose at five cents a 
time. 
I.- said, " Well, my love, if yos 
43 
won't have any supper, we will have a 
cab and go home." 
She replied, `• No, young man, no four-wheeled cabs for me 
at this time of night." 
Some girls do, &c. 
We met one Sunday afternoon, 
For a 
day in Central Park; 
And when we mounted " One tree hill" 
We had, well, say a 
lark ! 
'Georgina said, " You know, young man, 
Some girls prefer a 
stroll ; 
Not me, when I'm in Central Park 
I 
dearly love a 
roll!" 
SPOKEN—Now, there's an extraordinary girl for you. 
Of 
course, I 
wanted to take her for a 
nice quiet lover's walk in 
some shady lane, but she said she'd prefer a 
roll. 
Then I 
wanted to talk to her of love, romance, and poetry, but no, 
she said she'd " sooner have a 
good dinner." 
Well, 
Some girls do, &e. 
Not long ago my uncle died 
And left me fifty pounds; 
As soon as I 
received the news 
My joy it knew no bounds. 
I 
thought, well, I 
will marry now, 
So I 
at once proposed ; 
But when I 
mentioned the amount 
Up went 
lovely nose. 
SPOKEN—The bad girl, she said she ought to have five 
hundred with such a 
man : me. I 
thought she would have 
jumped at me, you know, for, 
Some girls do, &c. 
Don't Forget a 
Friend. 
Written and sung by Charles H. Duncan. 
Copyrighted by 
George D. Newhall, Cincinnati. 
All through this world are many things 
That puzzle and perplex, 
And many of us find in life occurrences that-vex. 
The high, the low, the rich, the poor, 
Meet equal in the end, 
Though some may sneer and put on airs, 
With what good luck may send, 
Yet he who takes us by the hand 
And wishes us success 
We'll not forget in future, though 
His fortune may grow less ; 
We'll try to aid him, cheer him 
Upward, onward to the end, 
For should reverses come to us 
He'll not forget a 
friend. 
CHORUS. 
Oh I 
don't forget a 
friend, 
Pray, don't forget a 
friend; 
Let this your motto be through life, 
Pray don't forget a 
friend. [ Repeat.] 
The drunkard whom you pass with scorn 
Was once respected, too, 
And when a 
child, a 
mother's love 
He had, as well as you. 
When money filled his pockets 
He was hail good fellow then, 
But now, that all his cash 
Has flown, forgotten by most men. 
But now that all his cash has flown, 
Forgotten by most men. 
Let this a 
lesson be to you: 
Be temperate in all things, 
And give your fellowman a 
lift, 
Whom err misfortune brings, 
You cannot tell fr.'ni day to day 
What others they may sena. 
Let this your motto be through life 
Pray don't forget a 
friend.

Last Monday night I 
went to dine with my friend, Mister 
Brown ; 
While running thro' the' sloppy streets I 
clumsily tumbled 
down; 
heard a 
click upon the paves, it was too dark to see, 
But when I 
got to Brown's I 
found that I'd lost my latch— 
key. 
SPOKEN.—Yes, it really was the fact, I'd lost my latch-key. 
I 
determined to tell Brown about it but forgot. 
CHORUS. 
So I 
firstilid lose my latch-key, 
And through this I 
lost my bed, 
But through all my misfortunes, sirs, 
I 
never lost my head. 
At dinner I 
sat next a 
charming lady dressed in blue ; 
She really was so beautiful, and so amusing, too, 
That when the hostess gave the sign for the ladies to depart 
I 
found to my astonishment that I 
had lost my heart. 
SPOKEN—Yes, there was no doubt about it, I 
had lost my 
heart! 
I 
couldn't talk to Brown, I thoroughly disliked 
Brown ; and when he ordered up another bottle of claret I 
felt as though I 
could have strangled him. 
And so I 
lost my heart, 
Besides my latch-key and my bed, 
But thro' all my misfortunes, sirs, 
I 
never lost my head. 
When we had drank up all the wine we to the drawing-room 
went, 
And while my charmer sang a 
song, I 
o'er the music bent ; 
When leaning down quite close, to hear the words which she 
did say, 
The candle caught my whiskers, and burnt them quite away. 
SPOKEN— Yes, it caught my left-band whisker, so I 
had to 
have the other off to keep my balance. 
So I 
lost my whiskers and toy heart, 
My latch-key and my bed, 
But thro' all my misfortunes, sirs, 
I 
never lost my head. 
I 
bade good-night at 12 o'clock, and when out in the street 
1 
felt myself borne up aloft, in fact right off my feet ; 
The last thing that I 
heard was some one utter a 
loud curse, 
And when I'd got my senses back I 
found I'd lost my purse. 
SPOKEN—Yes, I 
was robbed—robbed just outside Brown's, 
too. 
He had gone to bed, as there were no lights in the 
windows, and no police, as usual, were to be seen. 
So I 
lost my purse, my whiskers, heart, 
My latch-key and my bed, 
But thro' all my misfortunes, sirs, 
I 
never lost my head. 
I 
wander'd ' bout the streets all night, because I 
had no tin, 
I 
tried in vain to get a 
bed—folks wouldn't let me in ; 
I 
heard the clocks strike i 
and 2 
and 3 
and 4 
and 5, 
And got back to my lodgings feeling more dead than alive. 
SPOKEN—Yes, caught an a‘aul cold, too, which, now that 
it has left me, has taken all my voice away. 
So I 
lost my voice, my purse, my whisker; 
Heart and latch-key, bed, 
But thro' all my misfortunes, sirs, 
I 
never lost my head. 
My song is done, and I 
have only just one word to say, 
Of good advice to give my friends before you go away— 
Into whate'er predicaments your person may be led, 
Lose everything you may possess, but never lose your head. 
SPOKEN—Yes, it is a 
matter of great consolation to me to 
think that 
Altho' I 
lost my voice, purse, .whiskers, 
Heart and latch-key, bed, 
Yet thro' all my misfortunes, sirs, 
I 
never lost my head.

'There's a 
pretty little maiden, 
That I 
ever shall adore, 
In Italy that bright and sunny land; 
My life would be a 
pleasure, 
I 
would wish for nothing more, 
If she would only share my heart and hand; 
Her father is a 
brigand, 
On a 
lonely mountain pass, 
And with him on the mountain she does dwell; 
There is no titled lady, 
In all Europe can surpass, 
That dear Italian girl I 
love so well. 
etrortus: 
Though her father is a 
brigand on the mountain, 
She's as gentle as the daughter of an Earl; 
And although i 
she set me free, 
My heart will ever be, 
A captive to that dear Italian girl. 
While roaming lovely valleys, 
'Neath the blue and sunny skies, 
A band of sturdy brigands bold and strong, 
Did capture me, and helpless, 
With a 
bandage o'er my eyes, 
A victim, I 
was quickly led along, 
THE ITALIAN GIRL —CoNTINuED. 
Five thousand pounds as ransom, 
They demanded I 
should pay, 
But that I 
was not rich enough to ! rive, 
And only for the pleadings 
Of that little mountain maid, 
They would not have permitted Inc to live. 
(Chorus). 
They put me in a 
dungeon 
Where I 
thought that I 
should die, 
And while the brigand chief with all his band, 
Were plundering poor travelers, 
This lovely girl came nigh, 
In gloomy night and by my side did stand; 
She tore my bands asunder, 
Bade me rise and quickly fly, 
And from her fathers coffers gave me gob I; 
And while the tears of love and pity. 
Glistened in her eye, 
The secrets of our hearts were plainly told. 
(Chorus). 
I 
bid her then to fly with me, 
And be my darling bride, 
Although her love for me was plainly shown, 
Her duty she declared, 
Was by her outlawed father's side, 
And so to America I 
returned alone; 
But I 
cannot live forever 
In this free and happy land, 
To Italy I'm going to return, 
To seek with love, and try to win, 
If only for awhile, • 
That girl for whom my heart will ever yearn.

Widow Dunn (Parody). 
Sung by Billy Carter. 
Dedicated to Harrington and Hart. 
I 
know a 
big fat widow, 
That keeps a 
livery stable, 
A 
making beds for horses that are sick, 
She's an awful early riser, 
And a 
champion appetizer, 
Like an eight-day clock 
She goes around on tick. 
She's from the country poor-house, 
Her husband was a 
tramp, 
In the English army he did beat a 
drum, 
And for singing tar-heeled Hanna's, 
Or murdering sick pianos, 
There's no marker for the big fat Widow Dunn. 
CHORUS. 
She is hunky, she is chunky, 
She's as handsome as a 
monkey, 
She's a 
fairy, she's contrary, 
She's a 
lamb, T. mean a 
ham, 
She's as tall as any ladder, 
I'd slug her if I 
had her, 
And kick the chest protector off the Widow Dunn. 
5S 
WIDOW DUNN (PARODY).—CONTINIIRD. 
She steals the morning papers 
Away from every door, 
She's an acrobactic, break-neck son of a 
gun, 
And at every wake or funeral, 
She goes to sing and dance, 
Such a 
tender creature is the widow Dunn. 
She's freckled, but she's pretty, 
And well developed feet, 
She has one back tooth that weighs a 
half a 
ton, 
And at every passing stranger 
She fires an ancient egg, 
So familiar is the Widow Dunn. 
CHORUS. 
She is moody, she is sankey, 
She's consumptive, she is crankey, 
She's rheumatic, she's lunatic, 
She's a 
bum, she weighs a 
ton, 
She is crazy, she is careless, 
She is toothless, she is hairless, 
Such a 
chromo is the big fat Widow Dunn.

Sung with great success by 
MURPHY and M ACK. 
t's very strange indeed to me, that go where'er I- may, 
So many queer remarks I 
hear about me every day; 
'Twas but last night upon the street, my style the boys did quiz. 
And one says " You can have it pards, if you guess what it is !" 
SPOKEN—As soon as they saw me they shouted, " Here it 
comes !" and as I 
approach they all began to sing— 
CHORUS.

Does it live do you know ? or is it a 
chromo ? 
Did it blow out, or did it grow out ? 
Oh ! for heaven's sake, what is it ? 
'Twas in the Park, a 
lively mob at me did talk and stare, 
" 
I 
wonder if it's loaded, and if that's all its own hair," 
"It lives, it breathes," one chap did say, its pulse is all serene. 
Approaching me " Old Krank," says he, " I'll see that you're 
kept green ! 
SPOKEN—Yes, and when I 
say a 
word back, they shout, 
" 
Look out for it, it's teethin' !" and then again comes the 
conundrum— 
What is it, &c. 
They asked how long I 
walked alone, and say " when were 
you canned ?" 
And hint I'd look much better if upon my head I'd stand; 
And as around the Square I 
walk, with gloves and cane and 
pipe, 
I 
heard them whisper everywhere, " I 
wonder if it's ripe !" 
SPOKEN—Yes, they want to know if I'm natural or artificial, 
and how many of me there are in a 
bunch, and whether I'm 
good raw

tll they wildly ask—

There are plenty we meet who could help if they would, 
But the fact is their money's all spent; 
They're too poor themselves, or they ain't in the mood, 
Or some other excuse they'll invent. 
But ask yon rich banker how much in his vaults 
These men have placed there to secure; 
And he'll tell you, if honest, their assertions are false, 
They could help our suffering poor. 
Can any one tell why those seeking for aid 
Always pass mi:iionaires with distrust? 
Can it be solem:: .ruth, what I've often heard said, 
That the rich seldom give e'en a 
crust? 
But there's the mechanic and laboring man, 
Ever ready to share his small storP, 
For nearly each one knows how ' tis himself, 
God bless,these true friends to the poor.

GOD BLESS OUR DEAR OLD FLAG. 
Dedicated to my esteemed friend MISS C. 
E. —E 
with best wishes. 
Original song, as sung by FRANK LEWIS) at 
the New National Theatre, Philadelphia. 
IN this glorious land of freedom, exciting times have been, 
I 
often picture in my mind, each great and stirring scene. 
I 
never looked upon the place, where our starry flag did fly, 
But the great events of by-gone days, to picture them I'd try. 
'Twas a 
noble sight at Yorktown, when Washington did stand. 
And took the sword from that great lord, who did invade our 
native land. 
He tried his best to win the fight, and low our banner drag, 
But the Yankee boys rose in their might, and saved our deny 
old flag. 
Again when shot and shell they flew, like hailstones thick and 
fast, 
A 
gallant youth he braved them all, as he clung to the mast. 
He seized our country's emblem, which had been shot away, 
And waved it in the foeraan's face, way down in Mobile bay, 
A Yankee cheer it then went up, in triumph from our fleet, 
And soon the enemy gave way, defeated, cowed and beat. 
The boy descended to the deck. of Farragut we brag, 
And every brave tar with joy cried out, " God bless our dear 
own old flag." 
Again when trouble came us o'er, and darkest was the hcur, 
A 
noble general staunch and brave, he proved his mighty power. 
He stood upon the battle plain as thousands did him fight, 
His emblem was our Stars and Stripes, his motto " Truth and 
Right." 
Though treated bad by friends at home, he scorned the fight to 
yield, 
He swore he'd win the victory, or perish on the field. 
He led his columns manfully, repelled each fierce attack, 
The battle was Antietam boys, the hero, Little Mac. 
And when the great Centennial came, each nation in this world, 
Did bless our glittering emblem, when its bunting wasckfurl'd. 
They came from Asia's sandy plains, from Afric's 
From far Australia's lonely wilds, from Europe's sunny Rhine. 
They came to see the poor man's home, where the Sun sinks in 
the West, 
Where every wanderer finds a 
bed, and is with plenty blest. 
And when our banner bright went up, no tyrants flaunting rag, 
The nations all with joy they cried, God bless that dear old flag!

The Dear Old Flag of Green. 
Written for PADDY and ELLA M URPHY by BARNEY FAGAN. 
How proudly floats forth our noble flag of green— 
That emblem of purity—in solitude serene. 
With rapture and delight the Irish bosoms heave; 
To earth its oppressors our martyrs yet will cleave 
No taint of dishonor at that banner ever hurled, 
Since first its proud foulds to the breeze were unfurled. 
May the bright suns of heaven cast their beams on that 
spot, 
And let a 
day of freedom be the Irishmen's lot. 
CHORUS, 
Then let your shouts re-echo, far, far across the sea, 
All loyal sons stand ready to see that isle set free ; 
Quickly swell your ranks, and let your war cry be: 
Death to the tyrants; on, on to victory! 
With pride we can look on the noble deeds and fame 
Of Irelands trusty warriors—immortal be their names. 
Foremost in the strife amid the shot and shell, 
The glorious din of battle-cry our patriots help to swell 
Their praises resound throughout our noble land, 
On every battle field their deeds of bravery stand. 
With courage true as steel and eager for the fray, 
Right manfully they strive to help gain the day. 
Then let your shouts, &c. 
MI honor to the heroes now lying 'neath the clay, 
The memory of their valiant deeds never shall decay. 
2 
Unfurl to the breeze the flag they love so dear, 
Proclaim to its foes they'll yet have cause to fear. 
Loud above the din of the roaring cannon's peel, 
The steady tread of cavalry, the clanging of the steel, 
Will be heard the cry of victory, as it resounds from 
shore to shore, 
Old Ireland's sons will wake to find their bondage chains 
no more. 
Then let your shouts, &c.

Composed by Rowft HOWARD, and sung with great success by JOHN 
RUSSELL, of THE RUSSELLS. 
Where the water lilies grow, 
And the zephyrs gently blow, 
Where the waters softly flow,

And the dew drops softly fall, 
While the moon shines over all, 
Kiss me, darling Annie 1

When the flowers fall asleep, 
And the moon shines o'er the deep, 
Tell me I

Then, my darling Annie!

List'ning to the tale of love, 
Whisper'd unto Annie! 
How he envies me the bliss, 
Pressing such a 
form as this, 
How he wishes he might kiss 
Your sweet lips, my Annie!

While the little stars do shine,

‹ourting Cards.— This Series of Cards has been arranged 
to meet a 
want frequently felt by young people—a 
want of means of 
expressing one's sentiments in such s, way as to be non-coarmittal. 
Many young ladies are visited by :Itlemen who are either too difffi. 
dent or too fearful of a 
repulse, to venture upon asking tbe momentous. 
question. 
The lady is restrained, by custom and a 
sense of propriety, 
from doing anything that would seem to be an unladylike encourage-
) 
ment. As a 
result of this dilemma, many lives are spent as an unloved. 
tedious existence, which might have been prolonged and enjoyed in the 
happiness of matrimony. 
This pack of Cards will overcome the diffi-
culty, and being in the shape of questions and answers, will cover every 
phase of courtship. 
The sentiments conveyed therein need not be 
adopted by the parties to the game as their own, unless it accords with. 
the state of their affections, which fact makes a 
further explanation un-
necessary. The playing of these Cards is not restricted to two players, 
but may be enjoyed by evening parties
