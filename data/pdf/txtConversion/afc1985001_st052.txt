JOHN DILLINGER A
Frank Lankas Gardenville, N.Y. ?1941
John Dillinger, Johnnie Dillinger The G-Men will chop you down Some of the things that
you've done done Have been makin' the government frown. Your numbers up, the words
gone round You won't be goin back to jail You'll be a bull's eye for the police And they'll
throw the lead like hail.
John Dillinger, Johnnie Dillinger The finger will be laid on you And the G-Man watchin' with
his gun Is goin to get you too. When he stops you Johnnie He's gonna stop you dead And
head you out for the golden gate Packin a load of lead.
O Billy the Kid and the Dalton Boys And others of their kin Were bad gun men outside the
law But they were brave gun men within Now you know the old time story How Billy met
his end It's too late to change you now So long, old friend.
