Introduction. Mary Hoefferle interviewing elementary art teacher Donna 
Recker at Emmeline Cook Elementary School in Oshkosh, Wisconsin on December 5, 2013. 
Donna read and signed release form. 
 
00:00:22 
Educational background and years of teaching: Always liked art, people’s praise 
built her confidence, phenomenal high school art teacher. Undergraduate degree in Art 
Education at UW Oshkosh. Worked for Americore at Boys and Girls Club art. Taught two years, 
then got a Master’s Degree through UW LaCrosse Learning Community, taught total of 11 
years at elementary. Since one of her schools is a charter school, she attended many 
workshops and professional development on brain-based learning and conscious discipline.  
 
00:05:00 
Typical day: Arrive at 7:30, set up supplies for three different grade levels in 
different places in the room, turn on computer since she uses power point for every class. 
Doesn’t chat with anyone in the morning, check email three times a day. 50-minute class 
periods, sometimes five minutes between class periods – enough to enter daily grades in web 
grader. Eat lunch quickly in 20 minutes at one school, then prep for afternoon classes. In the 
other school, eat in lounge with other teachers. Some days, teach only one afternoon class, 
other days three classes. Teach 24 sections a week, technically not full time, but it’s not going 
to last much longer. Full time is 25 classes a week. Students leave at 2:35. After school, in one 
school, she shares the room with the music teacher, so cleans up everything. Then, enters and 
fixes grades in the computer. Do email. Some prep for next day’s lessons. Leaves at 3:15 due 
to 24 sections.  
 
00:11:36 
Work at home: No need to bring work home anymore. Knows her job, has 
things organized, and due to 24 sections. Not the case in past years. 
 
00:12:24 
Joy in her work: Likes the kids, their enthusiasm, their perspective. Their 
creative ideas. The job meets her need to be creative –creative lesson planning, 
demonstrating. Connecting to kids. 
 
00:13:18 
Dislikes about her work: Some of the things that happened in the district, state 
and community. Feels like she is paying more attention to behaviors rather than teaching art. 
Feels that the state and district have made things more difficult than they need to be. Children 
only have one 20-minute recess per day – they used to have three recesses. Kids are squirrely. 
No longer have one school for special needs help – now the special needs are spread through 
the district, not getting the resources they need. Now have LD CD ELL CDMS students in one 
class.

Classroom teachers: Stressed by adoption of Common Core Standards and 
testing. She hasn’t been as effected by these changes. Some new teachers aren’t making it 
three months. They are told to leave or are resigning because of the workload – its insanity. 
Veteran teachers have enough tools in their belt to handle it. Mountain of work that’s 
ridiculous. This is primarily an elementary problem. Suggests 75 minutes of art a week since its 
cut out of the classroom. Classroom teachers who like art and know that kids need it, 
integrate art. New teachers are not – too overwhelmed with other duties.  
 
00:20:48 
Relationship with colleagues: Depends on the school – she worked in 5 
different buildings in 11 years. At E. Cook, before Walker’s turnover in which the school lost 40 
percent of the staff, this school used to be the most welcoming school – the staff was like 
family. Lost principals, people are nice but not much cohesion. At Shapiro, since it’s an open 
concept building, the staff is closer – they literally see each other more. Closest friend is the 
janitor. He knows everything. He talks to all the other teachers. Self-serving relationship with 
classroom teachers – if she has a problem with a student, she has to hand it off to the 
classroom teacher and need their help.  
 
00:24:00 
Principals: She asks for money for supplies and need the supplies purchased. So 
when the money disappears or if she asks for help and it’s not honored, that makes a poor 
principal. She’s very independent and doesn’t ask for much. If she asks for help, she has tried 
everything else. Most principals are good. The district level administration is not well-liked. 
Frustrated with scheduling. No adaptive art in elementary school, but have pull out adaptive 
art in middle and high school. 
 
00:27:45 
Relationship with other k-12 art teachers. See each other once a month for an 
hour. When all k-12 art teachers get together, less productive. Doesn’t have that much in 
common with high school. Can support middle school to some degree. Pam organizes the 
meetings for elementary art teachers and keeps them on task – focus on topics of curriculum 
and student learning outcomes.  
 
00:31:05 
Job related jokes, traditions, nicknames: Hardly any time to talk to colleagues. 
The custodian and I have lots of fun together.  
 
00:32:00 
Staff meetings: many of the topics doesn’t pertain to specialists. One principal 
makes an effort to include her and other specialists. 
 
00: 32:47 
Relationships with parents: Some fabulous parents providing support and 
supplies. Strong PTO that funds collaborative art projects. Used to attend the parent-teacher 
conferences to discuss behavior problems with parents of difficult students – very little 
impact, so stopped doing it. Story about an angry parent upset with a classroom management 
decision.

Cycles of the school year: No single school art shows, so all the elementary 
schools display work at the Masonic Temple in November. Each teacher submits 20 pieces per 
school. On-line art shows – each school takes a month. Twice a year, work is displayed at 
Central Office – just two works per school. In the spring, they create a group library art show. 
Important to put work in public to garner support. 
 
00:42:00 
Response from people when she tells them she is an art teacher: Oh that must 
be fun! Stereotype of art teacher: disorganized, flighty, super creative, laid back – she isn’t any 
of those. She’s very organized and does squish student creativity a little bit, but makes 
learning safe.  
 
00:43:45 
School politics: The protests and the political upheaval in recent years didn’t 
affect her that much. At the time, she was pregnant and was on maternity leave and focused 
on family rather than job. She didn’t like how teachers were villain-ized, but for the most part 
she wasn’t involved. At every level the protests failed, so felt it best to put her head in the 
sand. 
 
00:45:20 
Changes in her job: Felt that kids came to school with experience with hands on 
stuff. Now, when they enter school, it’s as if it’s the first time they’ve seen paint. They are 
more computer-savvy and have streets smarts, but know how to do less and still have more to 
say to you. Much more verbal and visual but less fine motor ability. TV is introduced too soon 
instead of play dough, sandbox, playing with toys. Not much change in ethnic diversity. Higher 
poverty rate, though.  
 
00:48:15 
Advice for new teachers: Don’t do it! If she was just starting out today, not sure 
that she would choose this path due to all the things that have happened in the last few years. 
Also – it’s hard to find a job, and if you land a job, will it pay your bills? Not a lot of nice things 
to say about that right now. 
 
00:50:27 
End of interview.
