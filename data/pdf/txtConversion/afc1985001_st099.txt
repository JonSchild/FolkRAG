Santa Barbara Earthquake
SANTA BARBARA EARTHQUAKE 4098 11B1
Vester Whitworth Arvin, 1940
Way out in California On a hill so tall Was the town of Santa Barbar' That they thought
would never fall.
But, on one fatal morning The sun rose in the sky The people all were praying “O Lord,
please hear our cry.”
When daylight found the people With the sad and aching heart They were searching for
their families That the earthquake tore apart.
But some of them were sleeping Beneath the fallen stone Their lips were closed forever
Never more to cry and moan .
It's just another warning From God up in the sky To tell our human people That he still
remains on hgih.
We do not know the moment When He shall call us home But we should all be ready
Before our time has come
