I: 
I’m going to move. 
I2: 
Sorry? 
I: 
I’m going to move. 
I2: 
That’s fine. 
I: 
Just for a second. I’ve gotta warn him. I’m going to put these right over here, okay? Okay. 
I2: 
Just a reminder to turn your phone on silent. 
M: 
My phone’s in there. 
I: 
All right. We’re going to get started, and the first thing I want to say, M, is thank you, M. 
M: 
You’re welcome. 
I: 
For being willing to do this. We really are grateful, and I also want to say thank you for the work that you 
do because we believe it’s really, really important. And we want to get that message out to the world and let 
others know what you do and how valuable it is and why it’s important, so that’s why we’re here today. And 
we’re feeling like it might be more effective messaging to hear your stories and putting a face to it. 
M: 
Yea. 
I: 
So, we’d like to start with your story and just learn a little bit more about when you got started doing 
personal care work and how and why? 
M: 
Well, I started, and I’ve been doing this work for 16 years now, and I also took nurses aide classes, and 
I wanted to do it because [48.24] I wanted to help other people. 
I: 
Okay. Did you—I mean there are a lot of ways to help people. How did you get started in this particular 
line of helping people? Were you interested it—well, you had taken the CNA course, is that right? 
M: 
Yeah. Well, and I enjoy working with the elderly too, so I wanted to get experience in that. 
I: 
Okay. So, what was your first job? Do you remember? 
M: 
Well, not—this job pretty much. 
I: 
This agency? 
M: 
Yup. It was a different—they had a different name at the time. 
I: 
Okay. And did you—you saw an ad in the paper and responded or? 
M: 
I don’t really remember. 
I: 
That’s okay. Did you have any experience taking care of elders or taking care of anybody prior to that? 
M: 
Not prior to that, no, ‘cause when I started doing home healthcare [47.14], then I went and took nurse’s 
aide classes ‘cause I wanted to level up my experience more. 
I: 
Okay. So, you hadn’t had experience like taking care of a family member, for example? 
M: 
No. 
I: 
And you just decided to give this a try?

M: 
Yeah. 
I: 
And 16 years later you’re still doing it? 
M: 
Yup. 
I: 
So, you must like it? 
M: 
Yeah [laughs]. 
I: 
Or you would have left, I guess. 
M: 
Oh, yeah. 
I: 
Can you tell us what it is you like about it? 
M: 
Well, what I like about it is you’re one-on-one with the clients, so you go into the house, and you get to 
know ‘em a little bit better. You know, you get to—you can talk with them and everything, and they get to know 
you, and then help ‘em out, take care of ‘em [46.21]. 
I: 
So, have you ever done nursing home work or? 
M: 
No. 
I: 
Or assisted living? 
M: 
Assisted living I did, yes. 
I: 
So, you’ve worked in a setting where you had more than one client at a time? 
M: 
Yeah. Assisted living—I worked in assisted living, then I worked for like three other home healthcare 
agencies. 
I: 
Okay. So, you see a big difference between assisted living and homecare? 
M: 
Yeah. Well, assisted living is nice too because you got [pause]—assisted living is nice for the simple 
fact like you don’t, you know, if the client passes away or goes in the nursing home, you still have your hours. 
You don’t lose your hours. 
I: 
But in-home health care— 
M: 
But in-home healthcare you’re one-on-one with that client and assisted living you got like a whole 
bunch of ‘em—a whole bunch of clients. 
I: 
So, in home care if your client dies or goes to the nursing home, you lose those hours? 
M: 
Yup. 
I: 
And you have to pick up more clients? 
M: 
Yup. And sometimes they don’t have new clients all the time, so you’re kinda stuck there for a while 
without any clients. 
I: 
So, the income is not regular? 
M: 
Yeah. 
I: 
You can’t count on it [45.0]. 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018

M: 
Yup. 
I: 
So, over 16 years you’ve had quite a few clients? 
M: 
Oh, yeah. 
I: 
You’ve seen I’m sure a real range of people? 
M: 
Oh, yeah. 
I: 
Oh, yeah. 
M: 
[Laughs]. 
I: 
I sense that there are some stories behind that, oh, yeah. You probably have a lotta stories to tell. 
M: 
Oh, yeah. 
I: 
[Laughs] and you’ve probably seen a—I mean one of the things—we’ve learned a lot over the last 28 
interviews, and you know, one of the things that is different I think for homecare workers is that, especially 
those first few visits, you don’t have any idea what you’re walking into. 
M: 
And even when you go into a newer client’s house you still don’t really know what to do until [44.10] you 
get used to the client and the client gets used to you. And sometimes they don’t even train you, and you just go 
in there. Then hoping that the client has a good memory, so she can tell you what to do, and you know, look at 
the paperwork in the book ‘cause they got a paper in there sayin’ what to do. So, you look at that. 
I: 
So, the paper that tells you what to do, what kinds of things would it say on it? What is a typical— 
M: 
Well, it’s from Upcap and they got like this—if they need a bath, like bathing and, you know, hair care 
and laundry and, you know, meal prep and stuff like that. It’ll say that on there. It’ll just say certain things like 
their age and stuff like that. 
I: 
Does it say anything about their medical condition or? 
M: 
Yeah. Like, if they have dementia or something, it’ll say she’s got dementia. 
I: 
Does it say anything about the home situation? 
M: 
Not really, no. 
I: 
Like, if there are other people living there or what condition the house is in? 
M: 
No. 
I: 
It doesn’t say any of that? 
M: 
And it has like emergency contact on there, but not all the clients have that in their house ‘cause it’s 
only Upcap clients. 
I: 
So, most of your clients are Upcap? 
M: 
I got VA clients, too, so there’s VA clients and Upcap. The VA ones doesn’t have any paper, but they 
send the paper to the client, so— 
I: 
Oh, the paper goes to the client? 
M: 
Yeah [42.42].

I: 
So, you go to the home without any advanced paperwork? 
M: 
Yup. 
I: 
So, how do you know what to do? 
M: 
Well, most of the time it’s the same—I know it’s always personal care ‘cause I only go in when we gotta 
do personal care – it’s on all of ‘em even if they do their own personal cares, and mostly it’s always like meal 
prep, and you know, make their bed and laundry and stuff like that. And some of ‘em put it on their wall or 
something on what we do. 
I: 
You mean they put the paper up on the wall? 
M: 
Yeah. 
I: 
[Laughs] okay. And you mentioned earlier that you just hope that the client remembers enough to be 
able to tell you? 
M: 
Yeah. If somebody did—sometimes they do train me, and like one of the girls might train on it, and then 
if I forget, sometimes I ask the client—I have to ask the client, and I know they tell me, but sometimes the 
clients get overwhelmed when you ask ‘em all the time. You know, they get irritated if you ask ‘em [41.43] 
‘cause sometimes they don’t know either. 
I: 
Right [laughs]. So, you go in, and you know, okay, I’m gonna do some personal care work. I’m gonna 
do some housekeeping and things like that. Have you ever walked into a situation that totally surprised you? 
M: 
Yeah. I walked into a client’s house one time and she was on the floor. Her door was locked, and I 
couldn’t get in, and she had a key outside. So, I opened the door ‘cause she showed me where the key was 
before, and she was on the floor. So, she like passed out or something. 
I: 
Was she alive? 
M: 
Yeah. She was still breathing, and I—that was scary when you’re by yourself, but I called 911 
immediately. Then I tried gettin’ ahold of her family, and sometimes you can’t get ahold of family right away. 
They don’t answer their phone all the time, so I just kept trying to call her family, and they finally answered, and 
that was the only time that ever happened, something like that though. 
I: 
So, 911 came, and what happened? 
M: 
Yeah. Then their family members came too, and then she went to the hospital. 
I: 
And how is she now? 
M: 
Oh, she passed away like years ago [40.24] 
I: 
Oh, that was quite a while ago? 
M: 
Yeah. ‘Cause she was in the hospital there for a while, and she was still alive, and then after that, like, 
a while after that, she passed away. 
I: 
Okay. So, have you walked into situations where you felt unprepared, like the client needed things or 
more than you were able to provide? 
M: 
Oh, yeah. Like in nail care, they always say—it’s says nail care on the slip. I don’t know why they put it 
on the sheet even, but we can’t do nail care. You know, like trim toenails and trim fingernails ‘cause they want 
a nurse to do that. 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Mellisa Bobnock.  7.19.18

I: 
So, when your sheet says nail care, what do you do? 
M: 
[Laughs] I have to tell my client that we can’t do it, and he says, “Well, its on your slip.” And I said, well, 
I call my—I mean my boss told me we couldn’t do it, so I said I don’t know why they got it on their paperwork 
[39.31], but. 
I: 
Yeah. I wonder why they put it on there? 
I2: 
How do you manage the push and pull between what the client needs, what you’re supposed to do, and 
what your boss needs you to do? ‘Cause, you know, I’m sure there’s sometimes where you could just do 
something, like just shovel or whatever, but you’re not supposed to shovel or, you know, things like that? How 
do you manage all of what needs to be done, and what you want to do, what the client wants you to do? 
M: 
Well, unfortunately, sometimes you have to. We’re not supposed to shovel, but sometimes you have to 
shovel like a little pathway or something because the clients can’t do it, so. 
I2: 
You just do it? 
M: 
Yeah. 
I2: 
Yeah. 
I: 
Yeah. I think that is a good question, though. It’s tricky, and I think one of the things we’ve learned for 
sure about personal care workers is that you have—every situation’s different, and you have to do a lot of sort 
of quick thinking and problem solving right there on the spot to decide, you know, in this situation or that 
situation, how to handle it? Is that right? 
M: 
Yup. 
I: 
Would you say that’s accurate? It’s not like there’s a whole staff of people behind you like in a nursing 
home. 
M: 
Yeah. Exactly [38.19]. 
I: 
You’re there by yourself, right? 
M: 
Yup. 
I: 
And you gotta make a decision and figure stuff out and problem solve right then and there, so you 
know, all these situations—if you’re supposed to see the client but there’s 10’ of snow in front of the house 
what are you supposed—and they tell you not to shovel [laughs]. 
M: 
[Laughs]. 
I: 
[Laughing] what do ya do? 
M: 
Well, I don’t shovel driveways or nothing, but I mean I’ll shovel like by the door or something, so I don’t 
do nothing really strenuous about that. 
I: 
Yeah. It’s just all of this sort of constantly negotiating or trying to decide what—should I do this, should I 
do that? What’s okay to do? What’s not okay to do? So, there must be some—are there times when you’re just 
not really sure? 
M: 
Well, yeah, like say for example the client’s not feeling good, and you say, well, do you want me to call 
the ambulance or take you to the doctors, and then they say no. They don’t want you callin’ the ambulance. 
Most of them don’t [37.18] want you callin’ the ambulance. I’m like, well, if they don’t want me callin’ the 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Mellisa Bobnock.  7.19.18 
 
5
ambulance, then they must not be really that bad off, and they don’t seem really bad, but I mean that’s how a 
lot of ‘em are. But if I know it’s real bad, I’ll just call the ambulance. 
I: 
Can you think of a time when you had to make a decision like that—I know the woman on the floor was 
an obvious one, but you know, other situations where you’re not too sure, and you have to decide. Okay. I 
know you’re saying don’t call the ambulance, but I’m gonna call the ambulance. 
M: 
Yeah. Exactly. Yeah. I had ones like that, and I just—they were so bad that I just called the ambulance 
‘cause I mean there was no way of gettin’ ‘em out and putting them in my car and takin’ up to the hospital 
‘cause you don’t know if they’re gonna make it or not. 
I: 
Mmm hmm. So, do they get mad at you? 
M: 
No [laughs]. 
I: 
No, not since you saved their life [laughs]? Are there other situations though where they’re diabetic and 
they want to eat a bag a candy or they want to do one thing, but you feel like they should be doin’ somethin’ 
different, or you should be doing something different? 
M: 
Well, I do a few of ‘em. One of them they’re diabetic, and he’s pretty much set in his ways. If he’s gonna 
eat something [35.47], he’s gonna eat it. Like a snack, so if I tell him, no, don’t eat it he won’t listen to me 
anyway, so he’ll just [laughing]—and the hardest thing is trying to get ‘em to drink water. Most of these 
clients—‘cause a lot of ‘em don’t drink water, so you try to put a glass in front of them, and they don’t wanna 
drink it all the time. 
I: 
How do you get ‘em to drink it? 
M: 
Well, if they got dementia or Alzheimer’s, it’s a little bit harder, and I put the glass in front of ‘em, and I 
said, well, you should drink some water, and then usually you gotta set it in front of ‘em thinking that they would 
probably just grab it and drink it, but they like to sleep a lot. So, most of the ones like that. 
I: 
So, a lot of coaxing and encouraging and— 
M: 
Yeah.  
I: 
You probably have developed some tricks over the years—ways to get people to do something? 
M: 
Oh, yeah, especially showers too [laughs]. 
I: 
Can you tell us about that? 
M: 
That always the hardest thing, the showers. It’s like some of them I just have to ask ‘em if they took a 
shower ‘cause I know that they do it themselves, but there’s one that doesn’t wanna shower all the time. They 
said, well, you have to take one. I said you haven’t took one in a while, so then I just tell ‘em go in the shower. 
Then I go in there and I turn a light on, and I get the shower thing ready, and then he goes in there [34.14]. 
I: 
So, you go in and you prep it and turn the shower on, and then he just eventually goes? 
M: 
Well, he usually does it. He likes to do that himself. I just turn the light on and get things ready, and 
then he likes to sit there and rinse off himself, and then I’ll go in there and help him with the rest. 
I: 
So, can you give us a sense of the range of things you do for people from it sounds like you do a lot of 
personal care all the way to shower and--? 
M: 
Yeah. Some personal cares and house cleaning, meal prep, shopping.

I: 
Any lifting, transferring? 
M: 
Yeah. One of ‘em I got. There’s one I got like that. 
I: 
Can you tell us about that person? 
M: 
Well, you gotta use a Hoyer life on him. 
I: 
Can you explain a Hoyer lift to the general public? What is a Hoyer lift? 
M: 
Well, it’s attached. He’s got one that’s attached onto the ceiling [33.16], and you just put the lift 
underneath him when he’s in the chair or on the bed you’ve gotta put it underneath. And then you hook it up, 
it’s like a thing that—a remote that you push to the Hoyer thing down, and you hook the straps up on it, and 
then you just swing him over to his chair. It was really no— 
I: 
You make it sound easy. 
M: 
Yeah. It is easy [laughing]. 
I: 
[Laughing] have you ever had a problem with it? 
M: 
No. 
I: 
No? You know, the audio tape doesn’t pick up how you look, so I will say for the audio tape, that you 
aren’t that big of a person [laughs]. 
M: 
Thanks [laughs]. 
I: 
So, you know, have you—how do you work with people who are like twice your size or? 
M: 
I haven’t had too many that are like twice my size, but the ones I do they get around, and you know, 
they walk around and everything, but the one with the Hoyer lift, it is a guy, but I mean with the Hoyer lift 
there’s really no lifting to it. You just move the lift over. You slide it over, and you push the button to get ‘em 
down in the chair. Then do the same thing when you get ‘em up from the chair to the bed. 
I: 
So, all the way from Hoyer lifts to shopping, companionship. 
M: 
Yup. 
I: 
What about the range of houses, homes you’ve been in? Have you ever gone into a house and been 
surprised or shocked? 
M: 
Yeah. 
I: 
You wanna tell us about that? 
M: 
Well, there’s some people that like to collect a lot, so they got stuff all over the place. They save 
everything, and I’m thinkin’, like, well, how am I gonna clean this house when there’s so much stuff around, but 
yeah, some of them are—some houses are pretty bad, but lately the ones I been into they’re pretty good 
[31.09]. 
I: 
Have you ever been in a situation in a house where you were afraid? 
M: 
No. 
I: 
No? Have you—what’s the range of family situations? 
M: 
What do you mean, like? 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Mellisa Bobnock.  7.19.18

I: 
Well, you walk in, you know, and they might have a son or daughter that’s real attentive, and really 
easy to get along with, or they might have— 
M: 
Oh, yeah. Well, all the clients I got now I’ve been with ‘em for like 2, 3 years, so I haven’t really had any 
new clients in a while. They’re just the same ones, which is nice ‘cause then you get used to ‘em. But their 
brother, their sons or something that come up, and their family they’re all really nice. 
I: 
So, right now you’re workin’ with really good families? 
M: 
Yeah. Oh, yeah. 
I: 
They’re supportive and there’s no tension or anything? 
M: 
Nope. 
I: 
So, what is the most challenging thing about your job? 
M: 
That was a question I had on here.  
I: 
Maybe you don’t find anything challenging about it? 
M: 
Oh, that’s right. It takes a lot of patience and a good attitude [29.51]. 
I: 
A lot of patience? 
M: 
You’ve gotta—yeah, a lotta patience. You’ve gotta have a good attitude. If the clients are in a bad 
mood, you just gotta grin and bear it, and just deal with it. 
I2: 
May I ask the same question in a different way. Let’s say you’re sitting at a restaurant with your friend, 
they’re like, “I’m thinking about being a PCA. Is it tough?” What do you say to that? 
M: 
I would say it’s not tough, but it just takes a lotta patience and that right type a person to do it. 
I: 
What would the right type of person be? 
M: 
Umm [pause]. Like a nice, caring person, easy going, good attitude. 
I: 
Patient. 
M: 
Yup. 
I: 
Doesn’t let too much ruffle ‘em? 
M: 
Yup. 
I: 
It sounds like you pretty much just have to handle whatever is going on? 
M: 
Yeah. If the client’s, like, get you upset or something you just—you may get a little upset, but you just 
gotta kinda grin and bear it and say, well, they probably didn’t really mean that in that way ‘cause I know lots of 
them get frustrated ‘cause they can’t do anything themselves like they used to do [28.28], and that’s the main 
reason why they get frustrated. 
I: 
You mentioned something at the beginning about one of the characteristics that your employer likes 
about you is you’re so dependable. 
M: 
Oh, yeah. 
I: 
Which seems like that would be kind of important when people’s lives are depending on you? 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Mellisa Bobnock.  7.19.18 
 
8
M: 
Oh, yeah. 
I: 
So, can you talk about that just for a minute? Dependability and--? 
M: 
Well, just like that one client, the harder one or anybody, anytime she needs me to fill in for somebody, 
I’m always the one that fills in for everybody. 
I: 
I don’t think we had the tape recorder going when you were talking about that one client that nobody 
else wants to take [laughs]. 
M: 
[Laughs] 
I: 
You and one other person, apparently, are okay. 
M: 
Oh, yeah. Me and this other girl—other coworkers, we’re the only ones that will go in there, and he’s 
top-priority client, so if I have another client during the day, and he needs somebody, I have to skip out on the 
other ones and go to him ‘cause he needs the most help [27.11]. 
I: 
So, what does top priority mean? 
M: 
Top priority is like he’s bedridden. He can’t get outta bed. It’s like number one priority with Upcap. 
I: 
Okay. But is it that nobody else wants to go see him? 
M: 
Well, they say he’s mean, but he’s not mean. And they say that it’s too much work ‘cause they gotta do 
the Hoyer life, you know, and stuff like that. You gotta do a range of motion on him, and turn him in bed, and 
you know, but it’s really not hard. I mean once you get used to doin’ it it’s just like not working. You go there, 
and you just do it. 
I:  
I was joking earlier today, I said I think the PCA motto should be, I just do it. ‘Cause almost every 
person has said that, right? I just do it. It’s no big deal. 
M: 
Exactly. 
I: 
[Laughs] you know, we’re trying to figure out what you’re doing, and you sound—you know, I give ‘em a 
bath. I just do it. 
M: 
[Laughs] 
I: 
It seems like you take it for granted that it’s no big deal, and we’re going to take a pause right there, 
and while he switches out batteries. And I think we’ll just keep going the way we have been. Are there things 
that you would like to talk about that I haven’t asked about? Are there things you want to say? 
M: 
I don’t think so. 
I2: 
You’re doing great by the way. 
M: 
Oh, thanks [laughs]. Sometimes when it comes there are questions and I know I’m—am I recorded now 
or no? 
I2: 
No. Right now, we’re on a break. 
M: 
[Laughing] okay. Sometimes when I get put on the spot I can’t think of what I’m gonna say, and I wrote 
it down, but it don’t make any sense when I write it down sometimes, so [25.11]. 
I: 
Well, you’re not alone. 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Mellisa Bobnock.  7.19.18

I2: 
Yeah. Ya know, you don’t have to make sense. Again, this is just a conversation, and if someone was 
to take a conversation then like, you know, singularly things wouldn’t make sense, but like as a whole story 
they will. So, don’t worry about having each sentence sound perfect. 
M: 
I just figure I’ll talk what I do, and explain what I do, and that would be— 
I: 
You’re doing fine. 
I2: 
Just think about specific times when some of those things happened. You know, like you can talk 
about—I’m just using an example. Like if you’re going to talk about something difficult, think about one time 
when it was difficult because it’s not—it’s easier for people to relate to your experience, and like putting 
themselves in your shoes than to just be told something. I hope that helps. 
M: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
Do you ever have anybody ask you what you do? 
M: 
A lotta people always ask me what I do for a living, and I said home healthcare. 
I: 
And do they just say, “Oh.” I mean what if they said, “Well, what does that mean? What do you do for 
home healthcare?” 
M: 
Most of the time they say, “Oh.” [Laughs]. 
I: 
And then don’t ask anything else? 
M: 
Yeah. That’s it. I’m no label or nothing, like an LPN or an RN, so [laughs]. 
I: 
All right, so we were just talking about what you say when people ask you what do you do, and you say 
I do home healthcare. 
M: 
Home healthcare. 
I: 
And then they don’t ask you anymore questions? 
M: 
Mmp mmm. 
I: 
Why do you think that is? 
M: 
Well, some people when I say I do home healthcare [23.23] they say, “Oh, I would never—I could never 
do that.” You know, they say they could never give other people showers and stuff like that. And I go, I said, I 
don’t know it doesn’t bother me. I just, like I said, I just do it [laughs]. 
I: 
You made a comment about you don’t have an RN or an LPN or letters behind your name. 
M: 
Mmp mmm. 
I: 
You think that makes a difference? 
M: 
Well, it kinda does, and it doesn’t really make a difference, but just makes you know more. You just 
know a little bit more if you were an LPN or RN, but a CNA I took nurses’ aide classes too, so that’s how I 
know a little bit. That’s how I know about the Hoyer lifts and all that. That’s where I gained experience with that. 
I: 
Do you think it matters to other people that you’re not an RN or an LPN? 
M: 
No.

I: 
No? Do you ever have anybody—I mean how do people react to you when they find out that you’re a 
home health aide? Is it something you feel really proud about, and you like to tell people about? 
M: 
I don’t know. I been doing it so long that I just say I work for home healthcare, and then that’s— 
I: 
That’s about it. 
M: 
Yeah. 
I: 
Let’s talk a little bit about—do you think it’s—one of the things we’re interested in is if there are regional 
differences. If it’s different being a home health aide up here in the UP than it is down state or in Detroit or, you 
know, are there things about being up here that are different? 
M: 
I don’t know. 
I: 
I mean for example, you get a lot of snow up here. 
M: 
Yeah. That’s one with draw ‘cause it’s like if you have a client that’s—if you had to go out of town for a 
client and you don’t like driving in the winter, then you have to drive it anyway just to get to the client’s house 
[21.14]. 
I: 
So, I’m thinkin’ of the guy who’s in bed and he’s high priority, what happens if there’s a big snow storm 
and the roads are closed? 
M: 
Oh, he lives right in town, so we just [laughs]—he’s easy to get to. 
I: 
But how do you get to him? In a car or? 
M: 
SUV. 
I: 
Oh, you use an SUV. 
M: 
Four by four [laughs]. 
I: 
Is that right [laughs]. I thought you were going to say snowmobile.  
M: 
[Laughs]. 
I: 
Do you have, do you use snowmobiles? 
M: 
No. 
I: 
[Laughing] no. 
M: 
We don’t even own one. 
I: 
Somebody this morning, earlier, said that they just walk. I said, well, how far do you walk? And she 
said, “Five miles.” 
M: 
Oh, wow [laughing]. 
I: 
[Laughing] that’s what I said. In the snow? Are you kidding me? 
M: 
And most of the time they want you to have a car when you work for a home health ‘cause you don’t 
know if the client needs you to go to the store or go shopping, but maybe her client doesn’t need to go to the 
store. Someone else goes, so she can walk then [20.20]. 
I: 
Yeah. I think she was just thinking about if she couldn’t get through ‘cause of the snow.

M: 
Oh [laughs]. 
I: 
It would be pretty hard to do this job without a car, though, wouldn’t it? 
M: 
Yeah. 
I: 
And one of the things that’s different up here is you don’t have any public transportation, like buses, 
and personal care workers can’t take a bus to get to their client. 
M: 
Yeah. Well, we got like a van around here that this guy has. It’s like a transportation van that people go 
in, but I don’t think they’re gonna like drop you off from one client and then go to pick you up and then go to 
another one [laughs]. 
I: 
Right. Now, do they charge for that? 
M: 
Yeah. 
I: 
You have to pay for it? 
M: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
Another thing that’s a little different in the rural area is it’s just the distances you go to get to people. 
There’s a lot of land—miles between your clients. Is that true for you? 
M: 
No. Actually, in these small towns like this, they’re all pretty much like right in town. 
I: 
So, all of your clients are right here in Iron River? 
M: 
Yup. ‘Cause I tell my boss I just want ‘em in Iron River if it’s possible, and she usually tries to keep ‘em 
in Iron river [19.02]. 
I: 
So, you have some control over who your clients are? 
M: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
And your hours? 
M: 
Yup. 
I: 
And I know you have a young son. 
M: 
I think it’s ‘cause I’ve been there long—I’ve been working there a long time too, so I can probably—she 
let’s me do that kinda stuff. 
I: 
She seems like a—I met her earlier—she seems like a pretty good boss. 
M: 
Yeah. 
I: 
And I’m guessing that that support is important to be able to have a boss that supports your requests 
and— 
M: 
Oh, yeah. 
I: 
So, do you have enough hours—do you feel like you have enough hours? 
M: 
Yeah. 
I: 
And do you mind if we ask how much your pay—your hourly wage? 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Mellisa Bobnock.  7.19.18 
 
12
M: 
$12. 
I: 
$12 an hour. 
M: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
And are you comfortable with that? 
M: 
It’s all right, but I mean I could say it could probably be a little bit higher, but I don’t think they’re gonna, 
you know, raise it that much higher [17.59]. 
I: 
And I think you mentioned your husband has a couple of jobs, so you have other income coming in to 
the house. 
M: 
Yup. 
I: 
You’re not dependent on your home health work alone? 
M: 
Oh, yeah, you can’t—it’s hard to be real dependent on that. I mean as long as the client—my clients 
have been pretty steady lately, but if you’re depending on it for like forever, of course, I did it for 16 years, so I 
guess I depended on it for 16 years, but sometimes it’s not real dependable all the time for the simple fact like 
if you lose a client, they go in a nursing home, and around here there ain’t—there isn’t a lotta clients all the 
time. 
I: 
So, you wouldn’t necessarily be able to depend on it for—to make ends meet at the house. It couldn’t 
be your only income in the house? 
M: 
No. 
I: 
No. So, are there other things that—the wages are challenging, and the lack of steady hours. 
M: 
And no benefits or nothing like that. I don’t get no benefits, no sick time, nothing [16.37], and no 
mileage only if you’re going to the store for some clients. 
I: 
Okay. I was thinking that had changed. That you got mileage now. 
M: 
Nope. 
I: 
Hmm. Are there other challenges about this job? 
M: 
That’s pretty much it besides like losing clients and stuff like that, and no benefits, and no sick time or 
anything like that. 
I: 
So, over several years you get—you develop relationships, and so when somebody dies how do you 
handle that? 
M: 
Well, you feel really bad, and you get the family a card and everything, you know, but it’s like you don’t 
wanna—it happens all the time, so most of the time the client, if they pass away, then I’ll try to make it to the 
funeral. You know, if I can’t, then I’ll just give the family a card. You do feel bad though. 
I: 
Have you had some favorite clients over the years? Are there any clients that come to mind that you 
got especially close to or you would call a favorite?  
M: 
Mostly all of ‘em I got are pretty—they like me a lot, so [laughs]. 
I: 
And you like them a lot? 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Mellisa Bobnock.  7.19.18 
 
13
M: 
Most of the time the clients when you work for ‘em—this is what happens. Like, if someone else—say I 
can’t make it to work or something and somebody else has to go in, they’re so used to that other person going 
in they’re like—that’s been going in there for a while that they don’t want anybody else going in for them. They 
just want that one person [14.53]. So, that’s  how some of them are around here. Like most of ‘em just want 
me, and I’m like, well, if I ever need time off somebody might have to come in for me, so you’ll just have go 
without me for a couple days [laughs]. 
I: 
And what would these—do all of these people have family members or do you have anybody that 
doesn’t have any family in the area? 
M: 
Yeah. They all got family members. 
I: 
They—all of them do. 
M: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
‘Cause one of the questions I’ve been asking is what would happen if there was no you? 
M: 
Well, my—one of my clients has—her kids live out of town, but her kids—she’s got an Apple I-pad, and 
they send her videos and stuff on there for Facebook, and the kids call her every day on the phone. So, like 
twice a day they call her to check on her. 
I: 
Wow. But they’re not physically here. They’re not able to provide the physical care— 
M: 
Exactly. 
I: 
--that he or she needs, so that falls to you? 
M: 
Mmm hmm, and they like the company too, because someone that don’t have—like that one I was 
talking about that has the kids that live out of town, they enjoy when somebody like us come in or even the 
Meals-on-Wheels driver, where they deliver the whole meals. They enjoy all that company because it’s 
somebody to talk to or they get to see somebody for the day [13.19] ‘cause some of them get so lonely that 
they just cry all day or something ‘cause nobody comes over. 
I: 
And being able to see, and talk to people, and socialize with people is important? 
M: 
Oh, yeah. 
I: 
You believe it’s important? 
M: 
Mmm hmm. I talk with mine, too [laughs]. 
I: 
What’s that? 
M: 
I talk with my clients too, so. 
I: 
I gather that’s part of what you enjoy about it? 
M: 
Yup. 
I: 
It’s a benefit? 
M: 
Oh, yeah. 
I: 
So, I know they get a lot out of you, do you get a lot from those relationships too? Do you learn from 
there or? 
M: 
Oh, yeah. Some of them even taught me how to cook certain foods, so. 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Mellisa Bobnock.  7.19.18

I: 
So, it goes both ways. 
M: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
You both get something out of it. 
M: 
Yup. 
I: 
Yeah. So, we mentioned earlier that there’s a huge shortage of direct care workers, and the number 
that I keep throwing out is that in Michigan we’re gonna need 32,000 more in the next 2 years. 
M: 
Wow. 
I: 
Yeah. Wow [laughs]. That’s a big number, so how do we recruit people? How would you go about 
convincing somebody that this was a job worth taking or would you? 
M: 
It is a good job. It’s a nice job because you’re one-on—like I said, you’re one-on-one with the client. 
You don’t have other people, like, big bosses around tellin’ you what to do. It’s just you and the client, and 
maybe their wife or something. Say they—you’re working for the guy and his wife is still living, sometimes 
they’re a couple. 
I: 
So, some freedom. I mean you have some freedom and flexibility with your schedule. 
M: 
Yup. 
I: 
And not having somebody stand over your shoulder all the time. 
M: 
Yup. 
I: 
But also, it’s rewarding. 
M: 
Oh, yeah. 
I: 
So, what would you tell—let’s say you were going into a high school and you wanted to recruit some 
people to be in this kind of work? What would you say to them? 
M: 
I would tell them it’s a very rewarding job, and you can build close relationships with the clients, but 
don’t get too close. I mean close relationships, and just a rewarding job. 
I: 
Are there things that would make your job— 
M: 
And flexible, and it’s flexible. 
I: 
Flexible, rewarding and [inaudible – wind] [10.33]. 
M: 
That’s what I like about that. Hours are flexible and some of my clients I got, they’re flexible, so if I can’t 
go on like a certain day, then I could go in and make it up on another day.  
I: 
Yeah. That’s important especially when you have kids. 
M: 
Oh, yeah. 
I: 
Right? So, what is rewarding about it? Do you feel like you’re making a difference and? 
M: 
Oh, yeah. I feel like I’m making a difference. That’s rewarding. Well, the rewarding part about it is you 
learn stuff from the client, you’re helping the client, and you’re—they’re getting company too. You know, some 
of them are real lonely, and they just like to see a face for the day. 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Mellisa Bobnock.  7.19.18 
 
15
I: 
So, why is that—I’m playing devil’s advocate, but why is that important? What difference does that 
make? 
M: 
Oh, it makes a big difference because you’re going to the house. If they haven’t seen anybody all day, 
and they just get very upset and they start crying and everything. You know, they get lonely, so most of the 
time they don’t have—their husband’s passed away, so. 
I: 
And what about all of the personal care that you do, why is that so important? Pretend I’m a 
policymaker, and you have to convince me that your job’s important? 
M: 
To keep ‘em clean and healthy. 
I: 
You think it helps keep them at home? 
M: 
Oh, yeah. 
I: 
Longer? 
M: 
Yeah. It helps prevent them from going to the nursing home. 
I: 
And is going to a nursing home that bad? 
M: 
Well, it’s not bad, but then if they could try to stay [8.36] at home for as long as they can, then that’s 
even better yet than going to the nursing home. 
I: 
And so, what would you say, you know, ‘cause I’ve been kind of offering some words here, but in your 
own words, let’s say I’m a policymaker, in your own words what would you say—what would you tell me if you 
were—you know, we have this huge population of people comin’ along—older people comin’ along—the baby 
boomers are comin’, and we has a state have to do something about it, and we, I think, all agree homecare is 
better than nursing home care. So, what’s it gonna take to make homecare successful? What do we need? 
You know, why is your role in homecare so important? 
M: 
To keep ‘em from going to the nursing home, and then they need to get more—recruit more workers, so 
they could get more help. 
I: 
What if I said you haven’t really convinced me [group laughter]? I don’t really care [group laughter]. 
Then what? 
M: 
Well, then most of the time if they can’t find—if they got more clients—if there was more clients—if they 
can’t find a workers, they’d be asking the workers that are working for the agencies now if they want more 
hours, so then they would be taking on the extra hours or the other clients would be put on a waiting list. 
I2: 
Let me ask you this, have you had any clients who have transitioned from a nursing home to homecare 
or vice versa or have you had friends who have worked at a nursing home and have experience there? What 
kinda of contrast can you draw between that? 
M: 
Like what do you mean like you said tension? 
I2: 
Yeah. I mean, yeah, the differences or have you—do you have personal experience of any difference 
between those two? 
M: 
Well, I had a few clients that went to the nursing home [6.13], and then they came back home, and 
most of the time they would rather be at home than in the nursing home.  
I2: 
What’d they say about it? 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Mellisa Bobnock.  7.19.18 
 
16
M: 
They said the nursing is nice, too, ‘cause you get waited on [laughs] left and right, but then they like it 
home. They wanna be at their own house ‘cause they say that the nursing home they don’t—they don’t walk 
you at the nursing home. They just put you in a wheelchair, and pretty much try to get it where you can’t walk 
anymore [5.42]. 
I: 
So, I’m gonna continue to be a nasty politician and say, I don’t—I just—I guess I don’t really care. I just 
don’t think what you’re doin’ is that important. 
M: 
[Laughs] that’s a throw-off question [group laughter]. It is very important, so then it keeps the clients at 
home, a home healthcare role. 
I: 
Does it make you mad at all that, you know, people have been trying to change the policies and give 
homecare workers more money and more respect and things like that, and you know, people have been trying 
to make those changes for like 20, 30 years, and nobody’s listening. Nobody seems to really get it or care or 
they have other priorities or does that—how does that make you feel? 
M: 
I think they should start listening about stuff like that for home healthcare. 
I: 
Does it make you mad at all? 
M: 
Yeah. It kinda does. 
I: 
Kinda? 
M: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
Yeah. It’s just a struggle to figure out how to get through to people or how to break that barrier, you 
know. 
I2: 
How to get people to relate, you know, and when we’re doing these interviews come across all these 
stories that set us back in our chairs because, you know, it’s like not common knowledge, and you have these 
experiences that like are just incredible, and you’ve met people that are incredible, and you’ve done the kind of 
care that isn’t really provided in many other realms. 
I: 
You know, and actually I’m trying to make all of the like politicians look horrible, I think that they’re just 
so not aware. The country is having this discussion about we need to—about workforce shortage, but any—it’s 
pretty much centered on making sure that clinical care—like care that’s provided in a healthcare clinic is 
improved, and that we get more geriatric doctors and geriatric nurses and geriatric social workers. You rarely 
hear anybody say anything about homecare or personal care aides. 
M: 
Yeah. I never hear too much either anymore. 
I: 
It just seems like it’s not—I don’t think their saying, “Oh, yeah, those personal care workers, we don’t 
support them.” I think you’re not even on their radar screen. You know, they’re not even thinking. They’re 
thinkin’ about clinical care, and licensed people, and how do we, you know, shake ‘em and wake ‘em up and 
say, look these are the workers that are actually making it possible for people to stay at home. 
M: 
Yeah. Exactly. 
I: 
So, somehow, we have to get their attention. 
M: 
Those were the ones I had to deal with more—mostly more stuff than the licensed ones at times. 
I: 
I used to be a homecare social worker for 20 years, almost 20 years, and so I keep telling these people, 
I think homecare agency social workers are pretty important, but I would only go in once a month, and I’d help 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Mellisa Bobnock.  7.19.18 
 
17
people with paperwork and bills and set ‘em up with services, but I wasn’t the one there every day givin’ ‘em 
baths and showers and making it possible. 
M: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
So, I think people just—we need to get you on their radar screen, you know, somehow. You have to 
make a lotta noise. 
M: 
Yeah [laughs]. 
I: 
So, that’s what we’re hoping these interviews will do [1.20]. We’re going to take a little pause here, and 
then we have one short section left, and then he’s going to take pictures before it gets dark. 
M: 
Okay. Can I take this off a minute? 
I2: 
Yeah. Absolutely. We’re on a break. 
M: 
Well, that ain’t too bad. I try not to think about this thing and I just look at you [laughs]. 
I: 
Just keep your eyes on me [group laughter]. 
M: 
Then I don’t worry about that. 
I: 
I see you look at it every once in a while, [end tape 1]. 
I: 
And are you ready? 
I2: 
Just about. Just about. 
I: 
Okay. Just focus on me. Just look right over here [group laughter]. Pretend he does not exist. 
I2: 
I don’t. I don’t. I’m not even here. 
M: 
[Laughing] 
I: 
Yes. Pretend that camera is not staring at you? 
I2: 
Okay. We’re good. 
I: 
Okay. And this is just the beginning really. You shouldn’t feel like there’s a ton of pressure on just this 
interview because I’m really hoping that we stay in communication. We want to do the traveling exhibit that we 
explained to you, but there are so many other things we would like to do that you could get involved in if you 
wanted to. So, for example one of the things we’re hoping to do is to start a personal care worker association, 
and I don’t know if that interests you at all or not, but a number of the workers have said they would really 
appreciate having some kind of organization that they could call their own, where they could start maybe 
developing professional standards, if they could get an official certification. So, there are a lot of things, and as 
other projects come, you know, we would like [inaudible – wind – 10.01]. So, it’s not just about today. 
M: 
Okay. 
I: 
So, you can relax. So, this final section I guess just a few things. We’ve already started talking about 
what would you say to a politician. You know, it’s just what is the message for the world whether it’s you or any 
personal care worker, what do we need to let the public know about what you do and why it’s important? How 
would you summarize? 
M: 
Like, what I would? Can you repeat that? 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Mellisa Bobnock.  7.19.18 
 
18
I: 
So, if somebody was sitting here, you know, and they just really didn’t understand what it is you do or 
why it’s important, and what value it has to society, would you be able to sort of enlighten them? 
M: 
It’s a very important role because you’re keeping the clients—preventing them from going into the 
nursing home, and you’re giving them the care they need and the companionship that they need, and it also 
gives the family a break, too, if the family is, you know helping their mother or something or father. It gives the 
family a break too. 
I: 
I’m glad you brought that up because right now there’s so much concern about family caregivers and 
getting burned out. 
M: 
Oh, yeah. You get burned out 
I: 
Needing respite, needing a break. 
M: 
‘Cause I had to take care of my dad, too, when he was sick, and it got to be a lotta work after a while. 
I: 
So, you were your father’s personal caregiver? 
M: 
Well, I didn’t get paid for it, but you know, I was just trying to help, and then do what I can do, and then 
my other sister was helping, ‘cause he got real sick, and then one of the aides came in—a nurse’s aide came 
in and gave him showers and stuff like that, so it gave us a big break on things [7.42]. 
I: 
And that was important? 
M: 
Oh,  yeah. 
I: 
In what way? 
M: 
Well, would that be a good example? It wasn’t important because it gave us a break for one thing, you 
know, you get burnt out after a while, and it was also somebody that helped us with him. 
I: 
What do you think would have happened if you hadn’t had that help? 
M: 
Well, then one of us would have had to do it. 
I: 
There’s a lot of concern these days about people, you know, the caregiver ends up being sick or injured 
or in the hospital, and the caregiver actually maybe dies sooner or has to quit work. You know, there are 
negative consequences for the whole family not just the client. 
M: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
And, you know, we’re hoping that there’s some recognition that the work that you do actually helps the 
whole family not just the client, but it helps everybody be successful. Would you agree with that? 
M: 
Oh, yeah. 
I: 
It sounds like you’ve had some experiences along that line even personally. 
M: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
So, we started this out by saying we want to put a human face to you and the work that you do and 
humanize it so that people see you’re a real person, right. And we understand that as a real person you’re not 
just a personal care worker. There are other facets of you, right? 
M: 
Yup. 
I: 
Can you tell us a little bit about yourself [5.43]?

M: 
Well, I’ve been doing home healthcare for 16 years, and I lived in this area all my life, and got a 
husband and three kids. 
I: 
Three kids? 
M: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
And do you have hobbies? 
M: 
I like going to garage sales [laughing]. 
I: 
I’m a garage saler, love ‘em. 
M: 
And I like going to the lakes. 
I: 
The lakes? 
M: 
Mmm hmm. 
I2: 
You’re surrounded. 
M: 
And I know I never go—I never even get a chance to go to the lake [laughing]. 
I: 
Really? ‘Cause you’re working all the time? 
M: 
Most of the time, yeah. 
I: 
So, what do you do when you get home from work? 
M: 
I come here and come back to my house and we cook supper, and then my husband—me and my 
husband and son we go for a ride [4.40]. We like to go for rides or go out to eat or something. I like to go out to 
eat too. 
I: 
We’re sitting here in a beautiful, beautiful backyard that’s landscaped and has gardens and flowers 
everywhere, and you said, “Yeah. We love it out here in the country.” 
M: 
It’s really nice. 
I: 
I kind of think of the whole UP as out in the country. 
M: 
Oh, really [laughs].  
I: 
Yeah [laughs]. 
M: 
Well, we lived in town before, and livin’ in town—you got neighbors right next to you and everything, it’s 
like out here it’s so peaceful and quiet. 
I: 
And your husband is the gardener? 
M: 
Actually, we both are. 
I: 
You both do it? 
M: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
And you grew up in Iron River— 
M: 
Yup. 
I: 
And you still have family in this area?

M: 
Yeah. My mom. 
I: 
And you gave us an interesting fact. You were only down below the bridge one time in your life. 
M: 
Yup. 
I: 
When you were a little girl. 
M: 
Yup, and I actually got a sister that lives in Iron Mountain and she does home healthcare too. She’s 
been doin’ it just as long as I am. 
I: 
You got into it at the same time? 
M: 
Yeah. Pretty much. 
I: 
And does she like it? 
M: 
She loves it. She doesn’t wanna go do anything else. 
I: 
Do you talk to each other about it? 
M: 
Oh, yeah. 
I: 
And compare stories? 
M: 
Not really about that, no. But I know her and I we just been working home healthcare a long time [3.06]. 
I: 
It must be nice to have somebody to share it with? 
M: 
Yeah. 
I: 
Do you compare notes like what works, what doesn’t work? 
M: 
No. 
I: 
No. With certain clients? No? It’s nice that you share that with her though. 
M? 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
My sister’s actually on this project with us. 
M: 
Oh, really [laughs]. 
I: 
Yeah. So, she and I share this kinda work, and I enjoy working with her. Do you have other questions? 
I2: 
No that was— 
I: 
I think we’re beginning to lose light, and we need to have this photo shoot here, so we can get these 
beautiful pictures taken of yourself, so I think I’ll just say thank you so much for this interview, and really again, 
thank you for the work that you do. It’s really, really important work. 
M: 
Oh, you’re welcome. 
I: 
And never doubt that, so yeah. So, I’m going to bring this interview to a close and let K take over. 
M: 
Okay. He’s yelling my name. [her son] 
I2: 
Sometimes I like to ask kids if they know their mom’s names. 
I: 
You know, we should ask him if he knows what you do for a living?

I2: 
Yeah. Can you call him out here? 
M: 
D. Come here real quick. They gotta question to ask you. 
D: 
I can hear from here. 
M: 
Okay. He can hear you from here. 
I: 
Oh, but we can’t hear you. 
M: 
They want you to come right here a minute. They’re not gonna record you. 
D: 
Oh. 
I2: 
Hey, D. 
D: 
What? 
I2: 
How old are you? 
D: 
Eight. 
I2: 
Oh, cool. D, what does your mom do for work? 
D: 
I don’t even know. 
I2: 
Really? You know a little bit, right. 
D: 
[Laughs] no.  
I: 
She just disappears in the day. 
I2: 
You know a little bit. What if your friend asks what does your mom do? 
I: 
What would you say? 
D: 
 They never ask that, right? 
M: 
Well, they might someday. I don’t know. 
D: 
I know one that won’t. A, right. 
M: 
You don’t know what I do? 
D: 
No.  
I2: 
I’m gonna call your friends and tell them to ask you tomorrow [group laughter], and then you’re gonna 
be like oh, my gosh. That guy did it [group laughter]. 
M: 
He’s spending the night at a friend’s house tomorrow night.  
I: 
What’s that? 
I2: 
Yeah, what’s his— 
M: 
He’s got a sleep over tomorrow night. 
I: 
Oh, a sleep over. 
D: 
AS.
