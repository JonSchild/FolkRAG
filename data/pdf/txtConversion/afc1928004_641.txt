BY BID. EDSON 
DED. TO LILLIE SELBENLL 
I'm infatuated with a 
little maiden, 
I 
scarce know what to do or what to say: 
When I 
met her twits early in the evening. 
She's as beautiful as flowers that bloom in May. 
As she passed she smiled, 
And then I 
asked permission, 
To walk along to pass away the time, 
Of love we talked, to me it was so pleasing. 
Then I 
asked this little maiden to be mine. 
CHORUS. 
Her style and ways are so complete, (Break.) 
With pretty tiny feet; (Break.) 
Oh I 
there's none that can compare 
With her for beauty, 
I 
think she said her age was seventeen; 
I'll be married when the autumn leaves are falling 
To my pretty captivating Adilene, 
At her house I 
visit every Sunday evening, 
To talk of happy times that are in store: 
For Adilene and I 
when we are married, 
We'll dwell in joy and peace forever more. 
Troa I 
long to hear the marriags bells a 
ringinrr, 
It wIl: he the happie-,t moments of my life; 
When to church I 
t.die this pretty maiden, 
And forever we are joined as man and wife.

Wander through the vale again..

I

Fondly thinking, love, of thee; 
Of the orchard, and the meadows, 
And that grand old forest tree. 
There we played beneath its branches, 
On the old swing side by side, 
And 'twas there my little darling, 
That I 
won you for my bride.

Standing by the mossy well; 
How I 
love that dear old homestead,

To the old home far from here; 
For on earth there is no other place 
To me so near and dear. 
In the grave-yard 'neath the willows, 
Stands poor father's lonely tomb 
And the night winds whisper softly, 
O'er his grave where flowers bloom.

I 
took a 
stroll, 'twas summer time, 
The birds were singing sweet; 
The reapers all were busy 
In garnering up their wheat. 
I 
stopped awhile to take a 
rest, 
And view the rippling grain, 
When a 
maiden fair with golden hair, 
Came tripping down the lane. 
CHORUS. 
Oh ! my, no flower is half so fair, 
As this little blossom rare; 
I 
stood like one bewildered, 
But I 
was not to blame, 
I've often blessed that summer day, 
When we met in the lane. 
(break.) 
The graceful form of this little miss, 
With wonder filled my eyes, 
She tripped so lightly o'er the grass, 
My soul was in surprise. 
Her eyes so blue, just pierced me through, 
While standing in the lane; 
No costly silks adorned this maid, 
But a 
neatly made delaine.

I

She was milking cows down in a

As I

In the cloudless sky above; 
Booli

love.

Maggie Jane McGarry, 
That's the name of my true love, 
Soon we will married be, 
She's like the little twinkling stars aboTe. 
Last night we took a 
quiet little stroll, 
Down by the babbling stream; 
There our tales of love we did unfold, 
Which seemed to me a 
dream. 
We spoke about the pretty flowers that grew, 
Until the hours were late, 
And she promised that she always would be true, 
When we parted at the gate.

JOYOUS, HAPPY, 
TO ARCHIE DELMANING. 
BY VERNER 1110WiRDI 
Joyous, happy, 
Always merry; 
May life be a 
summer day; 
Never shadow, 
Clouds or darkness, 
Fall across thy sunny way. 
May to-morrow 
Never borrow, 
Sorrows from the yesterday, 
Looking onward, 
Trusting upward, 
Happy be the sweet to-day. 
Loved and cherished, 
Kindly nourished, 
--Peace his garlands round thee twin; 
Joy and pleasure, 
In full measure, 
Until death be ever thine. 
FP-REST :QUEEN, 
BY ARCHIE DELMANING. 
Oh? the brightness of the day, 
It had scarcely passed away, 
The sun was sinking from my view, 
A 
maiden fair I 
met 
Whose face I 
can't forget, 
And her bright eyes sparkled like the evening dew; 
We sat upon the moss beside the running

The stars began to twinkle from above. 
And loving words I 
whispered to the Forest Queen 
When sne murmured I 
was her only love. 
CHORUS. 
In the twilight we were sitting, (Break.) 
Through the trees the birds were flitting; 
My heart was filled with love when I 
espied her, 
For it was my intention to propose, 
And while upon the brooklet's bank beside h 
r, 
I 
placed upon her breast a 
blushing rose. 
And at last we started home, 
Through the fields where,flowers bloom, 
And.upon my word it seemed to be a 
dream; 
For she looked so sweet and fair, 
With her neck and shoulders oare, 
That her beauty shamed the lilies by the stream. 
Her voice is mull of music as the brook that flows. 
My soul was thrilled with rapture by its tones, 
Her pretty dimpled cheeks filled my heart 
with happiness, 
When she told me that her heart was all my own.

The old willow chair now so aged 1

Where grandmother sat years before I 
was born. 
Though covered with dust, and so near its d, eish, 
Is dear to my heart in itz; treasures to-day. 
There often my mother would rock nie to sleep, 
And when I 
was young o'er my 
fevered cheek weep; 
And then I 
would list to her low fervent prayer, 
While held in her arms, in the old willow chair. 
ClIORa'e 
It rocked me by day, and it rocked me by night, 
While with us sweet songs filled my heart with delighlh 
And then her dear lips, would repeat a 
low prayer, 
While holding me safe in the old willow chair. 
I 
do nct remember my grandmother mild, 
?or when she went home I 
was only a 
child; 
But mother has told me again and again, 
How calmly she bore all the long years of pain. 
By day and by night, she was happy_thes say. 
In reeking the hours and the moments away, 
And this is the present she left to our care, 
The best of all treasures her old willow chair. 
it stood in the kitchen, long, long years ago, 
Through many a 
season of sunshine and snow, 
The old will w 
chair that our grandmother made, 
And witere in the slumbers of youth I 
was laid, 
And there in the days I 
now love to recall, 
It wae by our oirole most treasured et all; 
now in the garret a

Your voice is sad when e'er you speak, 
And tears bedim yonr loving eyes.

I'll take you back again, Kathleen, 
To where your heart will feel no pain, 
And when the fields are fresh and green,

And when the old friends welcome thee 
Thy loving heart will cease to yearn; 
Where laugh that little silvery „stream, 
Beside your mother's humble cot, 
And brightest rays of sunshine gleam, 
Then all your grief will be forgot.

BY JAMBS RICHMOND. 
SUNG BY FAT ROONEY. 
Copyright, 1881, by Mrs. Pauline Lleder. 
Och! my name it's Jeremiah Reilly Esquire. 
I 
control a 
political ring; 
I 
own forty-five big tenement houses, 
And I 
have seven sons in Sing Sing. 
I 
nominated myself into Congress, 
In the Senate I 
passed all the bills, 
I 
blackened three or four Senators eyes, 
For telling me to take a 
dose of pills. 
Spoken—Yes, I 
was arguing on the question which 
was the wealthiest, the United States or Grant, when 
Senator McGuire from Hoboken interrupted me, and 
I 
jumped off the grand stand and broke his neck-tie; 
General Sherman, Don Cameron and Roscoe Sprague 
I 
niean--Conkling shook hands with me, and one says 
to the other— 
CHORUS. 
Is this Mr. Reilly of whom I've heard tell, 
Is this Mr. Reilly, the elegant swell; 
If this is the Reilly that's spoke of so highly, 
And a 
pon my soul Reilly, you're getting on well. 
I 
was President of a 
bank till it busted, 
The cash assets was three paper collars; 
I 
stole thirteen truck loads of pennies, 
'And twenty one barrens of trade dollars: 
I 
had the book-keeper and cashier sent to prison. 
While I 
had to make my escape; 
And. while drinking champagne water in Canada. 
The Princess Louise got struck on my shape. 
Spoken—Yes. she says, had I 
known such a 
beauti-
ful man lived, I 
would never have married till I 
was 
sateen. 
Just then the Sheriff came in with a_warrant 
for my arrest, lie says— 
CHORUS. 
Is this Mr. Reilly of whom I've heard tell, 
Well now Mr. Reilly, you'll go to a 
cell, 
Axe you Mr. Reilly, that's spoke of so highly. 
Well Mr. Reilly, in prison you'll dwell.

Mary Ellen, that's her name, she lives down in the lank 
And I 
call her my pretty Irish Queen. 
CHORUS. 
My pretty, my pretty, my pretty Irish Queen, 
Her eyes they are so bright, they shine like stars 
at night, 
And her like I'm sure that you have never seen; 
Mary Ellen that's her name, and she lives down 
in the lane, • 
And I 
call her my pretty Irish Queen. 
You should see my pretty pearl, as she's skipping 
to the walk 
With her little water pail upon her arm, 
With her lovely flowing hair, arrah, with her 
none can compare. 
And all the Irish hearts she does charm. 
Next Sunday night at eight, down by the garden gate, 
I'll present her with a 
wedding ring; 
And happy'll be the day, when to the church 
we will WOW, 
And 
marry my pretty Irish Queen.

No sweeter one was ever heard; 
She was my life my guiding star, 
Charming and as gentle as a 
bird. 
Could I

Oft it made this heart of mine rejoice; 
Those happy days fore'er have gone, 
Never more I'll hear her voice.

Oft I

'Twould make this heart of mine rejoies,

In dreams I 
hear her voice so soft, 
What boundless joy it brings to me ! 
Why did my hopes so soon decay, 
And my only treasure from me flee. 
Could not my lot in life have easier been, 
Why was she so soon the angel's choice, 
Alas ! from earth her spirit's flown, 
Never more I'll hear her voice.

Hurrah, boys, hurrah, 
We're out upon parade to-day; 
Hurrah, boys, hurrah, 
Just gaze on us a-while. 
Our dress it is the latest style, 
But you see it, is our own choice of style, 
Every wench we meet, 
On us they sweetly smile. 
Csonus. 
March, boys, march, down through Hill street, 
Surely ketch a 
smile from every wench we meet; 
Our style is number one, we march as stiff as starch 
Don't we have lots of fun in the Excelsior 
Grand Guard march. 
Now the war is over, 
And we won't go to the war again, 
Our marching and our singing. 
By that we gained our fame, 
Our dress it is the latest style, 
But you see it's our choice of style, 
Every wench we meet 
On us they sweetly smile.

'ONLY THE WAY ON THE STAGE. 
By Fred J. ?tfackley. 
Sung by Henry Graham. 
If you will nsten to me Some facts I 
will mention. 
Co: coming the past and the present, strange age, 
And in them, my friends, to you I'll relate 
Some thins I 
saw one night and played on the titage. 
I 
came to this city with one or two friends, 
And went for a 
strAl, they seemed quite amazed, 
Wh n 
we read on the bills of the Bowery Theatre, 
And found a 
new drama was played on the stage. 
The first scene I 
saw was a 
street in New York, 
There a 
poor woman begging, she quiet old in age, 
Those zad means lie tried to keep her front starving, 
A 
very sad lesson of life's book a 
page ; 
But a policeman passed b, his face seemed in smiles, 
Planed his hand in his pocket and drew forth his wages, 
And he gave part to help this poor wretched woman, 
But ' twas only the way it was played on the stage. 
The scene it then changed from a 
street to a 
court rooms, 
There a 
prisoner on trial for a 
crime very sad, 
.13e'd murdered a 
man by the people respected, 
And the court room was crowded with people so glad, 
To see that man punished for the crime he committed, 
The jury looked stsro, and the judge i a 
rage, 
And they hung that rich man f 
•r 
the murder of Fisk, 
But it was only the way it wat played on the stage. 
lit the near scene I 
saw a 
c'ergyinan from Brooklyn, 
Who was dancitig a 
hornpipe, arid seemed quite the rap, 
Another one 1. ow Jersey was playing the violin. 
The audience in front with wonderment pized. 
For just at that minntea party named Tilton 
Then gave a 
fine aermon on the morals of the age. 
And I 
thought that that they practiced each 
sermon they preaoholk 
Dm wa8 only the e-ty it wae played on the etege.

In the deep twilight I 
wander alone, 
Thro' the old house as of yore, 
But the dear old home friends that my 
childhood hath known, 
Are gone to return never more. 
Wayward and careless, I 
left hearts of gold, 
A 
stranger the wide world to roam, 
tone are the dear ones who loved me of 
There's no one to welcome me home. 
CLIORUS. 
There's no one to welcome me home, 
There's no one to welcome me home, 
Gone are the dear ones who loved me of old, 
There's no one to welcome me home. 
Cold is the hearthstone, deserted the hall; 
Once tilled with gholneot and joy, 
Father will ne'er again answer my call, 
Or welcome his wandering boy. 
Aged and bending he sank to the grave, 
With prayers on his lips for his son, 
Though in its mercy Heaven answered to save, 
There's no one to welcome me home. 
Chornc. 
! 
how forsaken and lonely and cold; 
Everywhere darkness and gloom, 
Will ye not come to rue dear ones of old, 
And welcome your wanderer home. 
Mother and sister and brother's all gone. 
I 
wrote you I 
surely would come, 
Naught do I 
hear save the wind's plaintive inoaa. 
There's no one to welcome rue home. 
Chorus: 
3., 
There's a 
man lives in the alley with me, 
He's an Irishman from Franca; 
He's got a 
dizzy daughter yes, 
That takes in every dance. 
She bleaches her hair just once a 
year, 
She is the reigning belle; 
She ain't to blame, this giddy dame, 
For she's Mulligan's daughter Nell. 
CHORUS. 
She bangs her hair, and her mother besides— 
A blow from her fist would tell; 
At night she will roar and rap at the door, 
Mr. Mulligan's daughter Nell. 
She's mashing a 
feller named Tommy Flynn, 
He's one of the gang, you bet; 
'He's in our alley most every night, 
A- whistling for his pet. 
He whistles Baby Mine and Nancy Lee, 
His name he couldn't spell; 
While pulling hb, cht,root, this gay galoot, 
Is waiting for Mulligan's Nell. 
Chorus. 
I 
wish she'd marry this feller named Flynn, 
The alley would be ours once more; 
We'd not hair hini serenading then, 
Nor rapping at the tenement door. 
The landlord says, and the tenants also, 
They n'er saw a 
girl like Nell; 
-She'd spoil every place where she'd put her face--
She was always raising—Cain.

I 
once did know a 
farmer, 
And he was a 
faithful soul, 
He used to work upon his farm 
Around his country home. 
Ho had an only daughter, 
And to win her I 
did try, 
An-1 
when I 
asked her to be mine, 
The old man did reply. 
CHORUS. 
Treat my daughter kindly, 
And say you'll do no harm, 
And when I 
die 
I'll leave you both, 
My little stock and farm-, 
My horse, my cow, my sheep, my plow,. 
My home, my pump. my barn, 
And all the little chickens in the garden.. 
I 
loved this young dearly, 
And I 
thought that she loved me. 
And every evening I 
would go, 
Her lov, ly face to see. 
And watch her milk her father's cow, 
In it I 
saw ii.44 harm, 
And lots of fun I'd always have, 
Before I'd left the barn. 
Her father has consented, 
And we two will married be; 
We'd own our little country home. 
And live in harmony. 
No sorrow seems to hover o'er 
Our little cottage home, 
For all is blithe and happiness, 
Although we live alone. 
Chores.. 
Choral!, 
I 
have been to the north and been to the south, 
In traveling a 
than may a-far go, 
To the Jumping off p, ce before you will find 
A 
city to compare with Chicago. 
If you never have altered your name in your life, 
Or never did up to a 
bar go, 
Or never run away with another man's wife, 
They won't let you live in Chicago. 
Some folks send by Adams express, 
And others put faith in old Fargo; 
But if you wan't to go to the devil direct, 
Just enter yourself for Chicago. 
'The city with fast gals and gay gamboliers, 
Is as full as a 
ship with a 
Cargo, 
And it's truthfully said that the very best men. 
Fight chickens and dogs in Chicago. 
'The infants they feed on whiskey direct, 
And for liquor they to their ma's go; 
And the muly cows give, as some might expect, 
Whiskey punch in the town of Chicago, 
They won't let the ministers live in the town, 
For on him they will put an embargo, 
Unless he drinks wine with all his young friends, 
And then he may stay in Chicago. 
The men they play at faro and poker, 
And the most of them to tho war did go; 
And they sang that good song of the bonnie blue flag. 
All night in the streets of Chicago. 
Sonic might say their morals are bad, 
Or that they too far below par do go, 
But the devil a 
moral the folks ever had, 
liVho live in the to 
of Chicago. 
ARFEL IS GR AVE. 
TO THE CITIZENS OF CLEVELAND, OHIO. 
With'steady step, and muffled drum, 
The cortege passed along; 
And dreaded silence reigned supreme 
Amid the mighty throng. 
'The somber tolling of the bells, 
Reminded us in time we must 
Just like our President, 
Return from dust to dust. 
Men with heads uncovered, 
Would mutter Guitads name; 
And the wishes of each one, 
I 
am certain were the same. 
And if from jail he once were free, 
No power on earth could save 
The man that sent eur President 
To his untimely grave. 
We saw the streets in mourning, 
Which ever way you would go; 
And every one their sympathy 
In some way tried to show. 
Many a 
wife and mother, 
A 
fervent prayer has said, 
And taught it to their little ones 
Before they went to bed. 
And when the sufferer was laid 
In his last resting place, 
Then came an aged colored man, 
With the tears running down his &A 
He bought a 
little bouquet, 
With a 
card marked Uncle Dave, 
He said it was all he had to give 
For Master Garfield's grave. 
How sad it is, indeed, to see 
His patient hopeful wife, 
And and gray haired mother, 
For him she would give her life, 
how different their feelings were, 
While about him they did stand; 
When honored with the highest place, 
There is in our free land. 
Let us hope that his successor, 
Will be as fit to rule, and be a 
man 
That can't be made the politician's tool, 
So peacetul rest the ashes of our soldier, 
'True and brave, and our nation's tears 
Will moist the earth on James A Garfield's GraVic,

The wool was growing longer and Pompey 
getting stronger, 
Before that morn of sunshine when massa set him free; 
Be used to sing with pleasure, and play the 
songs we'd treasure, 
When we were all so happy before the jubilee. 
At breakdown and at party, old Pomp was 
hale and hearty. 
And none could dance so nicely, the colored 
maidens said; 
But time has brought him sadness, and gone 
is all his gladness, 
Old Pompey's gettin.' barefoot on the top of his heed 
CHORUS. 
The wool no more is growing, and Pompey's 
heart is knowing. 
Those joys he fondly cherished in bygone days have fled; 
The past he will remember, tho' bleak is chill December, 
Old Pompey's getting barefoot on the top of his head. 
All day he worked for massa, and at night would 
court some leads, 
Beneath magnolia blossoms that gleamed so fair 
and white., 
Or play the banjo sweetly, while darkiee danc'd 
so fleetly, 
When fell the southern moonbeans in floo;.1.s 
of mellow light; 
But those fond ties are broken, ad gone each 
tender token, 
That made his heart so happy, ere bliss of life had fled, 
Now days of joy are over, for maiden and for lover, 
Old Pompey's getting barefoot on the top of his head. 
The cabin too, is lonely, for cats and owls live only 
Where Pompey once WaS happy beforc, 
they set him free; 
The honey-suckle clambers above his silent chambers,. 
But no kind hand has trained them since 
dawned the jubilee. 
'Meath southern suns the brightest, old 
Poinpey's heart boat lightest,\ 
And sweeter was the fragrance these blooming roaes,ahs4 
But now he wanders lonely with dreams to

Only a 
love letter written long ago, 
it reminds me of the happy days gone by; 
Like a 
ray of sunshine, came this little sheet, 
How it made my poor heart throb with joy. 
But the writer's far away, I 
am left alone, 
Though she promised me she'd ne'er forget; 
Gone, but not forgotten, the tears they fill my eyes, 
Though in Heaven I 
know I'll meet her yet. 
CHORUS. 
Only a 
love letter written long ago, 
dear little messenger of love, 
It's all that's left me now, and it I 
dearly prize, 
And this missive it shall go where'er I 
rove. 
Only a 
love letter written long ago, 
This letter I 
have rea'l it o'er and o'er, 
Once it made me happy, now I 
read and sigh, 
For those happy days will come no more. 
Treasured in my memory are the vows we made, 
But they're broken and my heart does moan, 
Love's bright dream is blasted, all is over now, 
In the dreary world I'm left alone.

IT DONIT BELONG TO ME, 
When I 
was but a 
little child I 
used to go to seise 
And there I 
was so very good, they thought I 
was a 
fool; 
Because I 
never claimed a 
thing that didn't belong to me, 
For I 
was just as honest and as truthful as could be. 
While walking uut the other day by a 
police man 
I 
was stopped, 
lie says young man this piece of gold just from 
your pocket dropped; 
But as I 
never carried one, and had but little coin, 
Like an honest boy I 
did reply the purse it is not mine. 
CHORUS. 
No it don't belong to me, it don't belong to me, 
You had better inquire of somebody higher, 
it don't belong to me, 
I 
never saw the purse before, it can't be mine you see, 
I 
kuew nothing whatever about the purse, 
it don't belong to me. 
My wages being very small I 
live in humble style, 
But with the girls I 
lardy dah, among the great and fine 
I 
tell them almost anything, for I 
have plenty cheek, 
But little they think I 
do the swell upon five 
dollars a 
week. 
The other day I 
bought a 
pie, I 
placed it in my hat, 
I 
saw a 
lady on the street, I 
knew she'd stop to chat, 
My hat blew off, the pie fell out, the little boys 
laughed with glee, 
But when they brought it back I 
said it don't 
belong to me. 
Chorus. 
I 
occupy an attic room in a 
street away 
And in the next there lives a 
girl her name is 
Nelly Brown, 
Whenever I 
get a 
chance to talk or pass the time away, 
I 
have a 
little gossiping in a 
quiet sort of way. 
As I 
came home the other night oh ! what a 
dreadful scene, 
The landlord rushing after me saying, Bill, 
what ds.) ,?s tis mean„ 
Miss Brown has left behind this infant as you see, 
Says 1, you quit surprise me, sir, but it don't 
belong t.

Beside the stream that murmurs soft and low, 
in the nook we've known since childhaod, Eesie dear 
IV here the sunbeams o'er the ripples come and go. 
Overhead the birds are singing in the tree, 
Their joyous carols echo through the dell, 
Where the violets are smiling in the breeze, 
Then our happy, happy tales of love we tell.

Down where we've roamed in merry days lang syne 
I

And I

'1 
wandered o'er the meadows to the hill, 
Where the sweet flowers grew, and forever 
growing wild, 
And the stream e'er flowed by the mill. 
But the old mill house has gone to decay,., 
I 
loved it and so did darling Kate, 
And the miller he lies sleeping where the 
gentle breezes blow 
And we played 'neath the turnpike gate. 
CHORUS. 
Por the turnpike gate is the pride of my heart; 
I 
loved it and so did darling Kate, 
When she sits beside me now, there's a 
smile 
upon her bronr, 
That reminds me of the turnpike gate. 
And the old school house has gone to decay, 
Where the schoolmaster heard us recite, 
And those happy, happy days have faded 
from our vie% 
When our little hearts were filled with delight 
And when school was out we would wander to 
the spring, 
Where I 
drew for you pictures on your slate; 
And those happy childhood days they'll coma 
again no ngolft,. 
'came we played on the turnpike gate.

TAIL FROM MY ANGEL BROTHERIS 
SHIRT, 
BY CHARLEY FRYE, FOR GALLAGHER k 
WEST. SUNCi 
BY THEM WITH GREAT SUCCESS AT THE PEOPLES 
THEATRE, ST. LOUIS, MO. 
I've a 
little piece of calico, I 
ever fondly praise, 
In the inside pockets of my yeller pants, 
And over it I 
oft have shed great big three ounce tears, 
Likewise my sisters, cousins, and my aunts. 
But I 
don't want to knock i'ou cold with the 
dizzy Pinafore, 
Were I 
to do it why your feeling I 
would hurt,. 
But this little piece of rag, I 
love and hold so 
dear through life, 
Is the tail from my angel brother's shirt.. 
CHORUS. 
Wrapped up in my pocket in a 
yeller almanac, 
Though it's covered all o'er with grease and dirt, 
Were I 
hungry and. wanted bread, I 
would not 
give up a 
thread. 
Of the tail from my angel brother's shirt. 
How oft-times he's been licked, and how often 
he's been kicked, 
On this little piece of rag I 
love so true; 
And how often for protection to my certain recollection 
It,lias served him as a 
shield from mother's shoe. 
And the day I 
now recall while climbing o'er the wall, 
The wall was high and caused him to exert; 
When the threads they gave away and I 
took 
from him that day, 
This tail from my angel brother's shirt.

We had lots of fun while we was on our way. 
We are two acrobatic fleas, and can act on a

On the Pullman palace car they wonder who we are, 
We are two red hot injun rubber cod fish balls.

He tumbled in a 
sewer, when he found out we 
was poor, 
And fell through a 
double chested pair of pants. 
They use for a 
sign, when the weather it is line, 
To Albany New York we are going to call, 
We have a 
key right in our sock, for to open a 
dead lcck, 
We are two red hot injun rubber cod fish balls. 
CHORUS. 
Then down from the window comes the pretty ,

The landlord has gave us a 
warning, 
He'll do the Boston dip, when he finds out we

Through the fields of nodding rye, 
And the brightest sunbeams glimmer, 
In the azure-tinted sky ; 
Dwells a

As she gleans the golden grain ; 
One as blooming as the roses, 
Bright and winsome Winnie Wane.

At the bright dawn of the morning, 
Or when twilight shades the plain, 
You may see our queen of roses, 
Bright and winsome Winnie Wane. 
Hearts were made for joy and sorrow, 
Per life's sunshine and its gloom, 
And sweet Winnie in her gladness 
Rivals all that's bright i

She is kind to those that. suffer, 
And they never ask in vain, 
For the words of love and pity, 
From the lips of Winnie Wane.

THE GOSPEL TRAIN. 
SUNG BY 3. C. MITBPKY. 
The gospel train am coming, 
I 
hear her clos 
at hand; 
I 
hear dem car wheels rolling, 
And a, rumbling through de land. 
I 
hear de bell and whistle, 
It's coming round de curve, 
It's straining every muscle, 
And a 
busting every nerve. 
CHORUS. 
Den get on board, little children, 
Get on board, little children, 
Get on board little ehildr, 
Dere's room for many more. 
It's nearing now de station, 
! 
sinners don't be vain; 
But come and get ) our tickets, 
Get ready for de train. 
I 
think it will make a 
little halt, 
And stop upon the line, 
Aid give you all a 
chance to go, 
But she, will make her time. 
No signal for another train, 
To follow on this line; 
Oh ! sinner's you're for ever lost, 
If you get left behind. 
The fare am cheap and all can go, 
The rich the poor am there, 
No second class on board this train, 
No difference in the fare. 
Chores. 
Chorus. 
Mr. :1 
sUNti BY J. C. MURPHY. 
Dark was the night and the snow it was falling, 
Streets all deserted, the wind bleak and chill, 
Those who were happy were silently sleeping, 
Death in its mantle could not be more still. 
Hark to a 
noise— heavens, some one is crying! 
• 
Some one to-night is suffering, I 
fear, 
" 
Help me, oh ! help me, 0 I 
Lord I 
am dying, 
Must I 
die friendless is noboby near. 
CHORUS. 
Starving and crying, friendless and dying, 
Wandering about, but no friend could she meet; 
Cold winds a-teasing, her poor heart a-freezing, 
Heaven relieved her, she died on the street. 
Once I 
was young and as pure as a 
dew-drop, 
Often my parents were asked for my hand; 
Oh ! no—no, never, they could not part with me, 
Mother thought I 
was the best in the land. 
When they were d)ing, for me they were praying, 
Heaven have mercy, I 
cannot help cry, 
I 
sent them both to their grave's broken-hearted, 
Now on the street a 
poor outcast I 
die. 
Chorus. 
Where, oh ! where— oh ! where is my Mary ? 
Long years have gone since 
parteil from thee; 
Why did I 
leave you in grief and temptation, 
Death come to me and my mind will be free. 
Man go away and sit down to repentance, 
To see your poor Mary it's no use to crave, 
She now roams in heaven where God will protect her 
Her body lies deep in a 
lone pauper's grave.

One summer morn while rambling 
Down through the fields so green; 
Where hawthorn blossoms gently blow, 
I 
met Alice Aileen. 
Jo flaxen were her ringlets, 
Her eyes of Heavenly blue, 
Bo laughing and bewitching, 
Like a 
dart they pierced me through. 
CHORUS. 
When rosy May comes in with flowers; 
(Break) 
To deck her gay green spreading bowers; (Break.) 
A's there I 
love to roam, 
With her my little bright sunbeam, 
She is my life, my guiding star, 
My sweet Alice Aleen. 
In a 
shady nook far down the lane, 
In love's sweet peaceful bower, 
Beside a 
crystal falling stream, 
Oh! what a 
happy hour. 
'Tis there she whispered, 
I'll be thine, I 
love, I 
love but thee; 
4624:1 murmured low, when we are wed, 
119 happy I 
will be.

Did you ever hear tell of one Kitty McNish ? 
Sure, I 
am the one if you plaze, 
To flirt with the boys is my darlingist wish, 
And make them get down on their knaze. 
Wid a 
wink of my eye I 
cause them to sigh, 
'Till they're just as docile as a 
lamb. 
Their hearts I 
quite break, then give them the shake,. 
That's the kind of a 
hair-pin I 
am. 
CHORUS. 
They say I 
am a 
posy, 
A red rose, and a 
piana, 
Au oyster, a 
lobster, 
To catch me is their wish. 
But I'm a 
thorough Irish girl, 
Wherever you can find me, 
Sure every body knows me, 
I'm Kitty McNish. 
NoW I'll tell yon the kind of a 
fellow I 
like; 
It's one who at betting can win, 
Who on a 
straight alley can make a 
ten strike, 
Whose pockets are loaded with '• tin." 
When I 
b-11 him lie must come down with the diliFt. 
He must with me exactly agree, 
And not care a 
cent if I 
flirt with some gent, 
That's the kind of a 
fellow for me.
