Along Come Old Jinnie One Fine Summer Day
ALONG COME OLD JINNIE ONE–A FINE SUMMER DAY 4121 34B2
Sung by Jim Hurlbert Visalia California
Whenever I was a little bitty kid, you know, about— oh, it must 'a been about a year old—
maybe two years old—my daddy sung that little song to me, about 'long come Old Jinnie
one-a fine summer day.
'long come Old Jinnie one-a fine summer day And the river froze over end skeetered all
away With a banjo on my knee for to play the folks' tune And the Yankees is a-dancin' by
the light of the moon.
Oh, I walk end I walk and I walk and I say I walk end I polly-polly hear de band play. Oh,
watch the nigger swing while he pick upon a string Deedle deedle deedle deedle eedle
eedle oo.
Now they got the railroads all through the land And they cut through the mountain and shot
through the sand.
Oh, I walk and I walk and I walk and I say I walk and I polly-polly hear de band play. Oh,
watch the nigger swing while he pick upon a string Deedle deedle deedle deedle eedle
eedle oo.
Now dey got de news from Mexico Where de Yankees is a fightin' old little Chippewa.
