HAPPY LITTLE CHILDREN FROM TEl 
SOUTH. 
As sung by SEAMON and SOMERS. 
Words by HARRY BENNETT. 
Music by BILLY CARTER. 
KEEP your eyes upon us, children from the South, 
We're as merry as the little birds singing on the trees; 
Our hair's so tight we cannot shut our mouth, 
And we're always just as happy as can be. 
CHORUS. 
Then, dancing, laughing, jumping all the day, 
Music makes us foolish as the chickens in the hay. 
Then singing, shouting, to pass the time away, 
We're two happy little children from the South. 
When us darkeys we give a 
fancy ball, 
They watch us niggers as we promenade the hall; 
Singing, dancing, we can beat them all, 
For we're two happy litttle children from the South. 
Then dancing, laughing eV 
GABRIEL'S HORN, 
W HEN We meet in de eveiting we pass de time away 
As none but us culled folks can do; 
And it's on de kitchen floor we dance forever more, 
Coupled off with Hanna, Jane and Sue. 
CHORUS. 
.And we sing and dance, 
And wake up so early in de morn; 
We'll rise and shine before de break of day, 
When Gabriel blows his horn. 
When de day it am breaking and de work it hab begun, 
How I'd like dem good old times again to see, 
For we were happy den with our good old Massa Ben, 
In dat good old home way down in Tennessee. 
And we sing and dance, etc. 
Written by CHAS. SEAMON. 
Song and Dance. 
ONE day, while musing quietly, 
Not knowing what to do, 
Our thoughts did wander back again 
To times of long ago; 
When father appeared just like a 
boy, 
Would caper around and prance 
To the banjo's sweetest melodies 
In merry song and dance. 
CHORUS. 
Music is so very sweet, 
It always makes us move our feet. 
Oh, don't we love this dancing! 
It fills our hearts with joy; 
We caught it from our good old dad 
When we were little boys. 
(Sym.) 
(Sym.) 
The longer that we live 
We learn some new things good or bad; 
We always took the new things in 
We learnt from our old dad. 
This style of dancing now is new, 
Not like those days gone by, 
So watch us, and you soon will see 
How we make these old shoes fly. 
Music is so very sweet, etc.

WHAT COULD I 
ASK FOR MORE ? 
Sung by SEAMON and SOMERS. 
Written by W. F. BRYANT. 
I'm in love with a 
darling creature 
That lives here in this town ; 
She's a 
model in every feature, 
And her voice like music sounds. 
She's a 
style that's always graceful, 
And a 
smile would haunt you sure; 
She says she loves me dearly, 
What could I 
ask for more? 
CHORUS. 
For she's sweeter than the water lilies 
That grows down in the dell, 
And, oh how she loves her darling 
There's no one else can tell. 
The first time I 
met this beauty 
She was standing at the gate; 
The smile she gave as I 
passed her, 
I 
could not help but wait. 
I 
spoke about the roses growing 
So nice about, her door, 
She answered yes, and smiling, 
What could I 
ask for more ? 
For she's sweeter, etc. 
We're married, and we live so happy, 
She is the pleasure of my life, 
And now I 
am a 
papa, 
And a 
mother is my wife. 
Such a 
darling little infant, 
And it creeps round on the floor. 
Now shouldn't I 
feel manly, 
What could I 
ask for more ? 
For she's sweeter, etc.

Written by SA17L Srarrnizw 
On the Isle of Blackwell, 
That's where I 
have been, 
Sent me up for six months, 
Being full of gin, 
Put me in the quarry, 
Kept me breaking stones, 
Yellow mush they fed me, 
Made me skin and bones, 
Dressed me up so gaily 
In a 
checkered suit, 
flow I 
sighed for" tanzy" 
And a 
mild cheroot, 
Shut behind the grating, 
Just to take repose, 
Ought to see me playing 
Checkers with my nose. 
CHORUS. 
On the Isle of Blackwell working every day, 
Had a 
dose for six months, think I'll stay away, 
Now I've got a 
furlough from its sandy shore, 
They'll never, if I 
knows it. catch me any more. 
Keeper with a 
cowhide 
Drives you like a 
mule 
Makes you take the sea air 
When the breeze is cool, 
Marching all together, 
All to get your feed, 
Crack you on the fetlocks 
'Till they make you bleed 
Lock you up so gently, 
Taking heaps of care, 
Shave you with a 
crow bar, 
Cut off all your hair, 
Put you in a 
shower bath, 
Make you howl and cry, 
Scrub you with a 
door mat, 
hang you out to dry. 
Took me to the court house, 
Singing " I'm afloat," 
Called the Judge " old fellah," 
Said I 
was a " bloat," 
Put me in a 
carriage 
Quite against my will, 
Long with lots of bummers 
Dressed all up to kill, 
How I 
sighed for bar rooms 
Where I 
used to go, 
Little breeze I 
kicked up, 
Made a 
heavy blow, 
How I 
dream% of juleps 
I 
should like to tell, 
Woke up in the morning, 
Found them all a " cell." 
Told me I 
could " sherry" 
When my time was up, 
Left my country mansion 
Like a 
frightened pup, 
Bid the ladies good-bye, 
Said their love I'd share, 
Wanted me to leave them 
Just a 
lock of hair, 
Sailed for New York City, 
Feeling like a " mice," 
Longed for ice and bourbon, 
Hadn't got the price, 
Found my parents wealthy 
When I 
got ashore, 
Never go a 
bumming 
Never any more. 
(Chorus). 
(Chorus).

BABY BYE," 
Words by THEO. TILTON.

Copyright, 18'18, and music published by GEO. MOLINEUX, 31 
Fourth Street, Brooklyn, N. Y. 
Price, 35 cents. 
BABY bye, here's a 
fly! 
Let 
us watch him, you and I. 
How he crawls 
Up the walls, 
Yet he never falls. 
I 
believe with six such legs 
You and I 
could walk on eggs. 
There he goes, 
On his toes, 
Tickling baby's nose. 
Spots of red dot his head; 
Rainbows on his back are spread. 
That small speck 
Is his neck 
See him nod and beck_ 
I 
can show you, if you choose, 
Where to look to find his shoes; 
Three small pairs 
Made of hairs, 
These he always wears. 
Black and brown is his gown; 
He can wear it upside down. 
It is laced 
Round his waist; 
I 
admire his taste. 
Yet though tight his clothes are made, 
He will lose them, I'm afraid, 
If to- night 
He gets sight 
Of the -candle-light. 
In the sun webs are ipun; 
What if he gets into' one? 
When it rains 
He complains 
On the windo*-panei. 
Tongue to talk have you and I. 
God has given the little fly 
No such things, 
So he sings 
With his buzzing wings. 
Be can eat bread and meat; 
There's his mouth between his feet. 
On his back 
Is a 
pack 
Like a 
peddler's sack. 
Does the baby understand ? 
Then the fly shall kiss her hand; 
Put a 
crumb 
On her thumb, 
Maybe he will come. 
Catch him i No, let him go, 
Never hurt an insect so. 
But no doubt 
He flies out 
Just to gad about. 
Now you see his wings of silk 
Drabbled in the baby's milk; 
Fie, 0 
fie, 
Foolish fly 
How will he get dry ? 
All wet flies twist their thighs, 
Then they wipe their heads and eyes. 
Cats, you know, 
Wash just so, 
Then their whiskers grow. 
Flies have hairs too short to comb, 
So they fly bareheaded home; 
But the gnat 
Wears a 
hat, 
Do you believe that? 
Flies can see more than we, 
So how bright their eyes must be 
Little fly, 
Ope your eye, 
Spiders are near by. 
For a 
secret I 
can tell— 
Spiders never use flies well 
Then away, 
Do not stay; 
Little fly, good-day.

SUNLIGHT HID BEHIND A 
CLOUD. 
Words by R. E. O'BRIEN. 
Music by Prof. W. J. AMES. 
Copyright, 1878, and Music published by GEO. MOLINEUX, 
Fourth Street, Brooklyn, N. Y. 
Price, 35 cents. 
LIFE is full of toil and trouble ; 
Care and sorrow hover near; 
Gloomy thoughts by day oppress us, 
All our nights are pass'd in fear. 
Still a 
brighter day is coining, 
But tow'rd earth our heads are bow'd, 
And we cannot see the sunlight, 
Hid, just now, behind a 
cloud. 
CHORUS. 
Laugh at fate and scorn her arrows, 
Ne'er be by misfortune cowed; 
You can see, by gazing upward, 
Sunlight hid behind a 
cloud. 
Laugh at fate and scorn her arrows, 
Ne'er be by misfortune cowed; 
You can see, by gazing upward, 
Sunlight hid behind a 
cloud. 
Ne'er despair, tho' life seem weary, 
All the bitter cup must quaff; 
Weeping will not mend the matter, 
Better far at care to laugh. 
Life's a 
farce in which your acting. 
Should be careless, gay and proud, 
Like to his who sees the sunlight, 
E'en tho' hid behind a 
cloud. 
Laugh at fate, etc. 
Laugh with scorn an 
d 
defiance 
To the ills that life can bring; 
Trouble flees when met undaunted, 
Grief is robbed of half its sting. 
Firmly stand, erect and manly, 
Bend not like the pliant crowd, 
Light will beam in time upon you, 
Altho' now hid behind a 
cloud.

Price, 35 cents. 
YOUTH has gone forever, my darling, 
With its brilliant, sparkling zest; 
And the days are fast approaching 
When our dearest joy is rest. 
,We have tasted many pleasures, 
And their fragrance lingers yet, 
But I 
mark amid your tresses 
Snowy strands among the jet. 
CHORUS. 
You have worn when life was brightest 
Roses in your dark hair set; 
Wear with equal grace, my darling, 
Snowy strands among the jet. 
You have worn when life was brightest 
Roses in your dark hair set; 
Wear with equal grace, Ty darling, 
Snowy strands among the jet. 
We have lived and life was pleasant; 
We have laughed, our mirth was gay; 
We have sung and danced and flirted 
As our youth fled fast away. 
But the dance must end, my darling, 
Let it pass without regret; 
Time has placed his hand upon us, 
Snowy strands among the jet. 
You have worn, etc. 
Let us not for joys departed 
Grieve our souls with mournful thought; 
Truer pleasures are before us, 
If with patient faith they're sought. 
Let us win a 
happy future, 
Nor for past enjoyment fret; 
Let us wear a 
crown of honor, 
Snowy strands among the jet. 
You have won, etc.

DOODLE DE Doo was a 
dandy Cock nobin, 
His tail was done up in six yards of green bobbin; 
He hadn't a 
tail as big as a 
flea, 
But he thought it the handsomest tail that could be. 
CHORUS. 
Doodle de Doo, 
Doodle de Doo, 
Poor little Doodle de Doo. 
Doo-Doo he was wed to a 
little wee Wren, 
And mourned by his baby birds some eight or ten; 
But single or married ; 
deep woe must betide 
For any one now who is stuck up with pride 
Doodle de Doo, etc. 
Doodle de Doo he jumped on a 
big rail 
In order to show off his nice little tail, 
When a 
big Thomas Cat he jumped over the wall 
And swallowed Doo-Doo, his big tail and all 
Doodle de Doo, etc. 
MORAL. 
Now all you young folks who weep and bewail, 
Mind you take warning by this little tail; 
And while you are thinking of this thing and that, 
Think of Doodle de Doo and this big Thomas Cat 
Doodle de Doo, etc. 
Written by SAM DEVERE. 
Not long ago, while riding down 
in a 
car to the lower end of town, 
A 
gal got in who was dressed in brown, 
She was a 
nice young girl from Harlem. 
Her style was great—could not be beat-
1 
winked at her, she smiled so sweet, 
I 
walked right up and took a 
seat 
By this nice young girl from Harlem. 
I 
spoke and said I 
meant no harm, 
She carried a 
book upon her arm, 
She said her father owned a 
farm, 
This nice young girl from Harlem. 
She said she was going to meet her pa, 
Her little brother and dear mama, 
She was " giving me taffy" and " 
This nice young girl from Harlem. 
We left the car and took a 
cruise, 
I 
swore this gal I'd never lose, 
Bought lager beer and seventeen stews 
For this nice young girl from Harlem. 
In about two hours she got her fill, 
Then asked me to loan her a 
ten dollar bill, 
Said she'd come back—but I'm waiting still 
For this nice young girl from Harlem.

Written and Sung by SAM DEVERE. 
Some people think its nice, 
To give other folks advice. 
Their tongues are running morning, noon and night. 
They'll stop you in the street, 
Anywhere you chance to meet. 
Just to tell you what they thing is wrong or right. 
Though in luxury they may live 
Their advice is all they'll give. 
Their mouths are always open witb a 
speech. 
They'll tell you how you should, 
In this wieb ed world do good. 
But, you'll find they never practice what they preach 
Some people yell and cry, 
'Tis an awful thing to lie. 
Oh, yes, they think its such an awful sin. 
They'll advise you that its fair, 
To be always on the square, 
And try and never t 
uch a 
drop of gin. 
Tell you honesty is best. 
That the wicked have no rest. 
Of course they won't take nothing out of reach. 
Say to lead a 
happy life, 
Spend your evenings with your wife. 
But you'll find they never practice what they preach. 
There's the noble working man, 
Who does the best lie can. 
To get his family bread from day to day. 
He might work until he'd drop, 
In the fields or in the shop. 
Still not satisfied, they'd try and cut his pay. 
Bread and water is the stuff, 
For the poor its good enough, 
But if rich folks had to eat it how they'd screech. 
Let them tell it and they'd swear, 
That the rich can live on air. 
But you'll find they never practice w—at they preach.

Listen to me every one 
I'm going to sing a 
little song, 
And if its short, it can't be long: 
And if its right, it isn't wrong, 
And as its small, it isn't tall; 
Of course there's more, so that ain't all. 
Hanna Maria skinny atlas— 
Come and tie my shoestrings loose, 
And there's where you make the mistake. 
Once there lived a 
colored man, 
And when he walk.d 
he never ran; 
When he was born his life began; 
And Mary's lamb it was a

And as he s

And as he's warm, he isn't cold; 
So bob a

Shoo fly, don't you play policy, 
After the Opera's over. 
I 
hope I 
haven't made you sigh. 
If your eyes are wet they isn't dry. 
For when you laugh you doesn't cry; 
If that's the truth it ain't a 
lie ; 
For when I'm wrong I'm always right; 
And I'll sing some more to-morrow evening

rye come from a 
land far over the seas 
Where oysters and clams grow on apple trees, 
I've gone for ten years, without victuals or rest 
Trying to find a " Tillie Loo" birds nest,

Who lived upon matches and very strong tea, 
When I 
told her how wrong such a 
diet must be 
She stuck up her nose and said " Fiddle de dee-

saw an old woman who married a

She had no finger to put on a

And they say it gave her a

So to please the fine king whom she did tear,

She picked up hers.qf and slipped off on her ear.

Now if you've no objection, I'll sing you something new 
Of this and that and other things, and every word is true, 
Now Irish Whisky, or Lager Bier, or good old Holland Gin, 
Is good enough for thoroughbreds, but water is too thin. 
CHORUS. 
Then wake up fellows, we're bound to put her through, 
It's funny how we do it, but you bet your pile we do; 
Rip, rap, flip, flap, jump right up and break your back, 
Where have you been all summer with your cock a doodle 
doo. 
And there's our brave Ulysses, who smokes his fine cigars, 
some say that they're Connecticut, perhaps they're Cuba

He's got some trotting horses on Long Branch by the sea, 
If you ask him how he got them, it's shoo fly, don't bother me. 
CHORUS. 
A 
poor man once, now rich as any Jew, 
It's a

UOULDN'T HELP DOING WHAT I 
DID, 
Song and Dance by E. D. Goonnva. 
Sung by JOHNNY W ILD. 
THE sweetest of joys in life, 
At least to me 'tis so, 
Is to have some pretty girl—some brilliant little pearl, 
To tell you she'll have you for her beau. 
I 
met my angel at a 
ball, 
And of course in love we did fall, 
She said she would accept me, and she never could forget me, 
Of course I 
couldn't help what I 
did, 
I 
placed my arm [sym.] 
But I 
meant no harm, [syin.] 
For I 
couldn't help doing what I 
did. 
We passed very many pleasant hours, 
For I 
thought my love so kind, 
Until last Sunday night at her house I 
saw a 
sight, 
Which has caused a 
sudden change in my mind. 
My Nancy was out in the yard, 
Oh, to tell you the truth, it is hard, 
And beside this fickle dove—was a 
barber making love, 
And of course I 
couldn't help what I 
did; 
I 
stood amazed, Lsym.] 
My hair all raised, [sym.] 
And I 
couldn't help doing what I 
did. 
I 
challenged him to fight with me next day, 
For I 
thought it was my place to do it then, 
For she said she'd never harbor—any love for that ere barber, 
And vowed I 
was the dearest of the men. 
But when we took our places for the fight, 
The barber showed a 
letter she did write, 
Where she said I 
was a 
fool and she used me as a 
tool, 
And of course she couldn't help what she did, 
So off I 
straddled, [syru.] 
And for home skedaddled, [sym.] 
Now don't you think I'm right in what I 
did,

THE Spring has skedaddled, July had come, 
And the chickens had ceased to lay, 
Down by a 
puddle in Central Park, 
I 
first saw Sally Gray. 
She had a 
nice, bully, glass-eye, 
And was romping all the day, 
And I 
dearly loved, at sight, this girl, 
Whose name was Sally Gray. 
CHORUS. 
My frisky, frisky, Sally, Sally, 
Romping all the day, oh! 
I'll bet my life there's not a 
girl 
Can equal Sally Gray. 
As Sal walked out one afternoon, 
About ten o'clock at night, 
She met a 
tall man dressed in blue, 
Who said that I 
was tight. 
He also said I 
was a 
beat, 
My bills I 
could not pay, 
But my purse is in the care of one, 
And that is Sally Gray. 
My frisky, ttc. 
In the faro bank for Sally's sake, 
My cash I 
put away, 
That I 
some day to cupid's shrine, 
May take sweet Sally Gray. 
For she's dead gone on me, 
And as time it flies away, 
I 
shall often think of the puddle in the Park, 
Whirs first I 
met Sally Gray.

GIRL WITH THE JET BLACK HAIR. 
RIVAL SONG- AND DANCE. 
Words by ROBERT W ORDEti. 
Music by NED STRAIGHT. 
(1st Rival)—I 
wonder what can keep that girl, 
She's generally on time, 
I 
mean the charming octoroon, 
The subject of this rhyme; 
She passes here at half past eight, 
I'm always here to see, 
But there's so many other coons, 
See never looks at me. 
CHORUS. 
Oh how I'd dance, 
If I 
could get a 
chance 
To meet this charmer fair; 
I'd quick propose 
To lovely Rose 
This girl with the jet black hair. 
There's other rivals waiting now, 
And one right here I 
see, 
[Enter 2d Rival] 
I'll let him know that I'm the boss, 
If he interferes with me; 
(2d Rival)—You can have accommodations, 
If what you mean is fight, 
I 
want to have no quarrel, 
But still I'll do what's right. 
(Both)-0h, how you'd dance, etc. 
(1st)--Upon due consideration. 
I 
don't want to fight, 
(2d)—Let's shake hands and be good friends, 
Though rivals from to-night • 
(1st)—With all my heart, but first agree 
To put her to the test, 
(2d)----We'll make her say before we part, 
Which one that she loves best.

THE GIRL AT PRINCE'S BAY. 
Sung by Wm. M ETZ. 
Now listen to me white folks, and I'll sing you a 
hymn, 
Its all about a 
pretty girl that at Prince's Bay would swim. 
I 
tell you she's a 
daisy, that's what all the boys did say, 
And the first acquaintance which we made was down at 
Prince's Bay! 
CHORUS. 
Yes! It was at Prince's Bay, 
Where I 
met this darling, gay 1 
I 
took her home that very night, 
And before I 
left this little Miss, 
I 
gently asked her for a 
kiss! 
Next evening I 
went rite to the house, for on her I 
would 
call, 
And I 
met her coming down the stairs as I 
popped in the 
hall: 
Said I 
to her, good morning, dear, said she, how do you do, 
It's but a 
little while ago, when I 
was expecting you. 
Yes! It was, &c. 
She took me in the parlor and sat down by my side, 
So then, I 
asked her in joke, if she would be my bride ? 
will, she answered in a 
smile, if Pa gives his consent, 
For he has a 
house and lot and it will cost no rent. 
Yes! It was, &c. 
Oh 
talk about your house-lot, for that .s 
just what we 
could use, 
For I 
have ten dollars on the bank, and a 
pair of new clog 
shoes ; 
I 
also have a 
silver watch, that used to run all day! 
And if you have a 
chain to spare, just pass it up this way. 
Yes! It was, &c,

THE HYPOCHONDRIAC, 
or the Man that could never got well. 
Written and sung by SAN DEVERE. 
once knew a 
fellow who never was well, 
He was always complaining of ills, 
For ever and ever he never was done 
Of swallowing boxes of pills. 
He'd wake in the night, and yell at his wife 
To jump out of bed and be quick, 
And make him a 
plaster, and get him some pill, 
He knew he was going to be sick. 
CHORUS, 
'Twas pills, pills from morning till night, 
What ailed him he never could tell; 
He took all the medicine over was known, 
But still he could never get well. 
If a 
cold or a 
pain in the stomach he got, 
'Twould scare him so he could'nt speak; 
Ele'd jump into bed—eat nothing but pills, 
And poultice his head for a 
week. 
His wife, poor woman, was nearly wore out, 
He always kept her on the run, 
She swore she'd go to the druggists' no more, 
So he bought in his pills by the ton. 
'Twas pills, pills, lcc. 
Its ended at last, his troubles are o'er, 
There is many a 
poultice to make; 
He got up one night with a 
cramp in his heel, 
To try and find something to take. 
But that was the last of him ever was seen, 
He skirmished without any light; 
He swallowed some nitro glycerine, 
Which blowed tho poor man out of sight. 
'Twas pills, pills, Jtc.

While strolling out upon the beach, 
One Summer day in May, 
I 
met a 
charming little maid, 
Who chanced to pass my way; 
Such lovely eyes bewitching me, 
I 
never saw mote fair, 
But what won me completely 
Was, her golden flowing hair. 
CHORUS. 
She's such a 
little beauty, 
To love her is my duty. 
Such lovely eyes bewitching me, 
You'd surely at her stare; 
And what won me completely 
Was, her golden flowing hair. 
(Dance.) 
We chatted like two friends of yore, 
And leisurely strolled along, 
I 
praised her beauty more and more, 
She said that I 
was wrong; 
And when I 
reached her home, 
Where roses scent the air, 
She seemed like an angel grand, 
With her golden flowing hair. 
She's such, etc.

Table and two chairs R. C. 
Enter 
Old Man reading letter. 
Old Mn. —Yes, this is the handwriting of my boy. 
He 
writes me from Squeedunk, or rather he did write me, for 
this letter is dated some 16,000 years ago. 
0 ! Absalom, 
my son, how changed you must be now! 
0, how I 
should 
like to cast these glims upon you! 
(Enter Japhet Jcith carpet bag and umbrella). 
Japhet. — Yes, this must be the spot. 
Some two million 
of years ago I 
played seven-up upon this very floor. 
They 
told me I 
could find my poor gray headed daddy here (
dis-
covers Old _Van). 
hello! old sport. 
How 
is things? How 
do you flourish ? 
Tip us your flipper ? 
Old Man.— Tip us your flipper! 
Sir, what doyou mean ? 
Japhet. — Shake ? 
Old Man.—What do you want, sir ? 
Japhet. — I'm in search of a 
father, sir. 
I 
mean I'm in 
search of another man's father. 
I 
mean I 
want to be 
somebody's father, or somebody to be my 
father. 
I 
mean— 
what the deuce do I 
mean ? 
Old Man.—In search of another man's father! 
Well, sir,

[TuE O 
in ORPHAN. —Continued.] 
why don't you find him ? Why do you come around here 
trying to bother me? I'm not your father. 
Why don't 
you go and find the old scoundrel ? 
Japhet.—Tha6 what I've been trying to do for the last 
16,000 years, and I 
met a 
feller outside' and he directed me 
to this palatial mansion. 
Said you -Might` be my father-

mean this' young man's father I'm leoking for—for there 
are many supposed fathers running around loose now-a-
days. 
Old Man.—Well, sir, what is your name? 
Japhet.—My name is Absalom. 
Old Man (
ntazed).—Absalom! Absalom, did you say ? 
Why, that is the name of my long lost son! 
Come sit 
thee down. 
I 
would speak with thee. 
Come hither. 
Absalom did you say? 
(Both take chairs). 
Japhet.—Yes, sir; that is the young man's name ? 
Old Man.—What young man do you say, sir ? 
Japhet. — Why the young man whose father I'm looking 
for. 
(Daring all this Japhet is very nervous and twitching about 
in his seat). 
Old Man.—Well, is his name Absalom ? 
Japhet. — Yes, that's his maiden na.ile. 
Old Man.—And you say that you came from this young 
man. 
Where did you leave him? 
Japhet.—I left him sick with the measles some 14,000 
years back, and he is without a 
stamp in the world. 
Poor, 
penniless, grubless, sick and dying, and he said he once 
had a 
father. 
Old Man.—And his name is Absalom ? 
Japhet. — Yes, sir, (
spells name). 
A-b-s-o-1.a-m (
strikes _ 
Old Man over the knees with umbrella). 
0, the trials and 
tribulations I 
have passed through to get here! 
0, it was 
the worst place ever I 
was in my life. 
0, such rough 
times out there. 
Why, when it hailed the hail stones were 
as big as cannon balls and when they fell they burst like 
bumb-shells. 
And then the Indians. 
Why they crept up 
to your tent in the dead hour of the forenoon and then 
scalped you one hair at a 
time till your head looked like 
a 
watermelon. 
Old Man.—Good gracious! 
Japh,et. — Yes, and the grizzly bears came skirmishing 
around there, and the first thing you knew they would 
just lift up them hefty claws and scoop you out like a 
squeezed orange. 
Old Man.—Young man, you make my stomach ache. 
Japhet. — Yes, and the skeeters were as big as horses, 
and one day one of them came to the tent door and pre-
sented his bill, and because your son wouldn't pay it he 
took him on his back and flew up with him to the moon, 
and then your poor, poor boy fell down. 
Old Man (horrzfieel). — And was killed! 
Japhet.-0, no, he still survives to 
tell 
the horrible 
troubles he has passed through. 
Yes, and strange to say, 
when he fell, alas! he broke one of the largest rocks into 
a 
thousand pieces. 
So heavy did that poor young man 
strike that rock that he broke his fall and that's what savt.d 
his life. 
Old Man.-0, mercy on us, what a 
providential escape. 
Japhet. — Yes, but alas! he might better had been killed 
than to suffer the tortures he is now undergoing. 
Old Man.—And he is at the point of death and not a 
bottle of soothing syrup or a 
cent in the world ! 
0, if it 
should be my son, my boy, my son Abby! 
(Jumps 'up and grabs Japh,et and shakes him).

We ale bound to have these W K., girls,

We got two little Wilekey Wolikey's,

MYRA MAYNE, 
As sung by C. S. 
FREDERICKS, San Francisco Minstrels. N. Y. City 
BY the swift flowing stream at the close of the day 
While all nature so silently waits, 
Xnd the sun's golden beams fall across my pathway, 
Like a 
light from the heavenly gates. 
I'm so lonely to-night. 
I 
am thinking of one 
Whom my eyes will behold not again ; 
Now the wild rose and vine in their beauty shall twn, 
O'er the grave of my lost Myra Mayne. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, Myra Mayne, come back again, 
Don't leave me here alone, 
This world so dear without you here, 
My own lost darling Myra Mayne. 
I 
see the dark shadows creep over the green, 
I 
hear the faint breeze murmur low, 
Like a 
whip-poor-will's song, like a 
spirit unseen, 
Comes up from the meadow below. 
But it brings to mine eyes only tears falling fast, 
And I 
wait for a 
sweet voice in vain; 
What so often I've heard in the days gone past, 
Of my own my lost Myra Mayne. 
Oh, Myra, £0. 
Flow on, gentle streams on your way to the sea, 
Sing, birds. in your green shady bowers, 
Though you never, no never can bring back to me, 
She who sleeps neath the bright prairy flowers. 
But her fond image dwells in my memory yet, 
And often at night do I 
dream, 
That she walks by my side my beautiful bride, 
As she walked long ago by the stream. 
Oh. Myra, cicc. 
Written by &maim A. LIONARD especially for Jas. ilkaanumw. 
I'VE worn a 
jilted lover garb, 
A 
seedy snit of black, 
Though very few devine the cause, 
Though many knew the fact, 
Rut time has passed a 
joyous change, 
And she I 
wish to wed, 
Now feels inclined to go it blind, 
On the nigger dressed in red. 
Soon will ring the marriage bells, 
And shortly will be led, 
To hymen's shrine that gal of mine. 
By the nigger dresoed in rfod. 
Although I 
felt a 
little grieved, 
To think that one I 
loved, 
Should give such a 
nasty shake, 
My spirit usual moved; 
1 
knew faint heart would never Ida, 
I 
courage took instead, 
And bade my time in work martin% 
The nigger dressed in red. 
Written by FRANK DUMONT, and sung by HARRY W000soN 
with great success at Tony Pastor's. 
Far away in the South, among the cotton fields, 
Is the place I 
ever long to see, 
Oh 1 
the dear sunny clime where I 
was bred and born, 
And the memory is over dear to me; 
Oh! the mocking bird's singing in the trees close by, 
While far from the spot I 
now roam, 
In this wide, weary world wherever I 
may go, 
There is no place like the dear old home. 
CHORUS. 
/Then give me a 
home in the dear old South, 
For fondly I 
love it still; 
Then I 
sigh night and day. I 
long to see again 
Is that old log cabin on the hill. 
Oh! the ones I 
love is sleeping in the ground, 
When I 
am passing so fast away, 
And my heart grows so sad I 
long to return, 
Oh! the old man ain't what he used to be; 
And the magnolias bloom around the cabin door, 
'Tis then I 
turn with a 
sigh, 
Oh I 
I 
will go back again, back to them cotton fields, 
In that old cabin home there let me die. 
Then give ma, etc.

Written and composed by W. J. GROGAN, and sung by hini 
with great success in his sketch, " Uncle Tom's Return," 
My joyous days have passed away, 
For me there's no more rest; 
In Heaven's home soon I 
will be 
Amongst the innocent and blest, 
With angels bright in robes so white 
To protect and guide me on. 
There's a 
laurel now awaits the brow 
Of poor old, feeble Uncle Tom. 
CHORUS. 
No friend, no home, I'm left alone; 
To my grave I'm journeying on. 
Who will care, or shed a 
tear 
For poor old, feeble Uncle Tom? 
My wife and children, far apart, 
In some distant spot this world they roam, 
Or the good lamb granted their desire 
And their spirits away to heaven have flown. 
When my bones lay beneath the clay, 
And this sheep to his shepherd has gone; 
When you kneel to pray, a 
prayer then say 
For poor old, feeble Uncle Tom. 
CHORUS. 
When my bones lay beneath the clay, 
And this sheep to his shepherd has gone; 
When at prayer you kneel, a

For poor old, feeble Uncle Tom.

There's a

And a

She's loved by the rich and the poor, 
She is free from all olark design, 
She's welcome at every door— 
There's no such girl as mine. 
Oh ! there's no such girl, (Wt.

Went out to see what we could see.

To see him kill de bee, 
Yes to see him kill the bumble-bee, 
And I 
never will forget the bumble- bee.

Then smiled and gave a

A

Stood up against the wall. 
Say's he young man go try your strength; 
No charge—Its free for all.

And pulled with al his migh, 
Then said to me young fehow you bet

To pull

Went jumping through my heart. 
It tied my legs in a

It would make a

I 
got chain lightning you can bet, 
Through that damned old pulling machine 
You bet you'll crawl, etc.

ge• Little Book has lately appeared in print at Mr. A. J. FIBEIZR'll, 98 Nas-
sau street ceded the 
Little Flirt." We cannot say that we recommend 
it to our young lady and gentlemen readers, as we think it would only 
(encourage the bad habit of " flirting." 
Unfortunately, there is enough 
of it done without any further necessity of explaining " how, when atset 
nehere to do it," and this little volume would advise and initiate the 1IL. 
eorrupted in practicing what is commonly called "flirting." 
ebe N. Y. Eeening Telegram writes: " We ha-m lately seen 
neat little 
book, bound in Morocco leather, costing 'ewenty-five cents, called the 
"Little Flirt," published by A. J. FISHER, No. 98 Nassau street. 
It 
gives information of the modus operandi of flirting, and of the meaning 
of every motion of the handkerchief, fan, glove and parasol. 
As there • 
is nothing at all objectionable in the volume, and its contents might af-
ford some innocent amusement to many, we do not hesitate to moat-
mend it to our young lady and gentlemen readers."

Was noble, just, humane and kind, 
And virtue warmed her heart. 
But, ah! the cruel spoiler came—" 
this book, in the language of Mrs. Rowson, " affords a 
striking emanteie 
that vice, however prosperous in the beginning, in the end only leads 
to misery and shame."

American Fortune-Telling Cards.—This is tne old-
est and most widely known pack of Fortune-Telling Cards. We have 
peihlished it for years, and the demand is continually increasing. 
These Cards are arr ' aged and printed in series—H4,arts, Clubs, Dia-
monds and Spades—and each or these into K for King. Q for Queen, 
and K for Knave, and numbers 1, 3, to 10. 
The Cards are arranged in 
Isar rows, and are to be read according to directions. Many of the an. 
ewers depend upon the position certain cards bear to other cards. The 
method of playing is somewhat complicated, but the direct mns have 
been made so that very little study will suffice to an ordinary under-
standing. Many professional Fortune- Tellers use these cards, and we 
are in receipt of letters in relation to them from all parts of the U. S.

Courting Cards.—This Series of Cards has been arranged 
to meet a 
want frequently felt by young people—a want of means of 
expressing one's sentiments in such a way as to be non-committal. 
Many young ladies are visited by gentlemen who are either too diffi. 
dent or too fearful of a 
repulse, to venture upon asking the momentous 
question. 
The lady is restrained, by custom and a 
sense of propriety, 
L.om doing anything that would seem to be an unlady-like encourage-
ment. As a 
result of this dilemma, many lives are spent as an unloved 
tedious existence, which might have been prolonged and enjoyed in the 
happiness of matrimony. 
This pack of Cards will overcome the diffi-
culty, and being in the shape of qeastions and answers, will cover every 
phase of courtship. 
The sentiments conveyed therein need not be 
40 adopted by the parties to the game as their own, unless it accords with 
the state of their affections, which fact makes further explanation un-
neoessary. The playing of these Cards is not restricted to two players. 
but may be enjoyed by evening parties
