Introduction 
Sam Favaro 
00:39 
Sam Favaro talks about the origins of his father’s business. 
Originally a general merchandise store. Sold “everything 
from paint to nylons.” Current building was constructed in 
1931. Prior wooden building burned down. His father’s 
grandmother and great-grandmother put up the money. 
This backing enabled the three Favaro brothers to go into 
business. Two of the brothers soon left. Uncle Sam, their 
father’s wife’s brother, then came in to help run the 
business. The store was part of a chain called Pleasing 
Food Stores.  
 
02:38 
Italian businessmen in the city form Associated Grocers. 
When national grocery stores started opening branches in 
Baton Rouge, Favaro’s father decided to make a change. 
An avid fisherman, he began repairing rods and reels.

Sam Favaro describes the neighborhood when he was 
growing up. Weller Avenue last paved street in the city. The 
street was paved by Esso, the corporation that operated 
the nearby refinery. “I guess in the 40s is when really the 
fishing stuff started really good.” 
 
04:40 
Favaro’s father was born in Livonia west of Baton Rouge. 
His parents, in turn, operated a grocery store at a nearby  
railroad depot. Favaro’s father was able to both speak and 
write in Italian.  
 
05:53 
When the family moved to the Weller Avenue 
neighborhood in Baton Rouge, Favaro’s grandfather 
opened up a shoe shop. Favaro remarks on the variety of 
businesses along Weller Avenue at the time including a 
movie theater. Business owners along Weller Avenue were 
all friends, if not direct relatives. “They all worked together.” 
All were Catholic and went to the same church. 
 
06:48 
There was a mix of ethnic groups in the area including 
French and Italian. The area was once called “Rēpōlaville” 
(phonetic spelling). Favaro’s grandmother  
was a Repola. She owned property throughout the 
neighborhood. 
 
07:19 
“Weller Avenue in the old days was nice,” complete with 
the Avenue Theater at one end. Woods lay beyond the 
avenue. A mile away, where St. Gerard Catholic Church 
now stands, was a favorite hunting area. Going back to the 
opening of their father’s grocery store, the Favaro’s as of 
2015 have been in private business over 80 years. 
 
07:54 
Favaro’s father ended up owning a two block area along 
Weller Avenue. Sam Favaro figures his father received 
financial help from his cousin in Chicago. The cousin raised 
him like a son. 
 
08:30 
The transition to rod and reel repair started out as a hobby, 
then evolved into a business. When the business first 
operated as a grocery store Sam Favaro’s “daddy” 
employed six or seven clerks. Orders taken over the phone 
were later delivered to the customer’s home. Worked on 
the honor system with IOU’s. Most customers who lived in 
the area worked in the neighboring chemical plant. When 
they were  paid they would settle up their account.

Worked as a community back in those days. People pulled 
together. “Not cutthroat like you see today around the city. 
In the old days everybody knew everybody and they were 
all honest people.” Favaro cited example of a business 
down the street. When Hebert’s purchased a new cash 
register they would pass their old unit along to Mr. Favaro 
further down Weller Avenue. 
 
10:09 
Favaro was put to work stocking shelves in his father’s 
grocery store when he was in high school. His brother, Bill, 
began repairing rod and reels when he was still a teenager, 
as well. Favaro’s brother always enjoyed the repair work. 
Unlike himself, both his brother and his daddy (Sam uses 
the term “daddy” rather than “dad” or “father”) enjoyed 
fishing. Favaro shares a story of the time his daddy spent 
$50.00 on a salt water fishing excursion for him. Still in high 
school with other interests, Favaro really didn’t want to go. 
When he showed up for the outing with sunscreen and a 
book in hand, his father never invited him back. Relates 
another story of his father, sister, and brother dove hunting, 
then “plucking them feathers” like an assembly line. 
 
11:38 
Bill Favaro took over the family business when he got back 
from Vietnam. Sam Favaro, now retired, runs his novelty 
business out of the front of the store. He helps his brother 
with customers, answers the phone, opens/closes Monday 
through Friday, and handles all the accounting for the 
business. His sister helps out, too. “It’s a free deal. It’s all 
family.”

Word of mouth helped bring in business. In the early days 
Favaro’s was the only rod and reel repair shop in Baton 
Rouge. Sam Favaro’s daddy of old; Bill Favaro of 
today...work(ed) not for the money, but for the pleasure the 
work brings (brought) to them. Referring to the early days, 
Favaro commented, “When they did a job, they did it good. 
The people knew they weren’t going to get ripped off and 
they continued to come. We get now fourth generation 
coming in...they’ll say grandpa used to come, or great 
grandpa came, and he brought me here when I was little. 
People come back to reminisce all the time.” With its 
original look--wooden flooring, pressed tin ceiling--
customers enjoy coming back. A throwback to the grocery 
store days, no longer used refrigerated units were set 
outside at one point for prospective buyers. Favaro related 
that within 15 minutes they were stripped down by passers-
by for anything of value, then hauled away. Most white 
families have left the area. 
 
14:48 
Christmas Eve, 1989, explosion at refinery/chemical 
complex leads to a mass buy-up and tear down of homes 
in the area by Exxon. Intent was to create a greenbelt safe 
zone. Exxon representatives harassed area residents over 
the phone to get them to sell out cheaply. Favaro’s father 
aware of the outmigration before he died. Advised by 
friends, “now is the time to get out because they’re (the 
whites) going south.” Favaro talks about family properties 
which were sold to Exxon for little or nothing. 
 
17:29 
Favaro reflects on program initiated in the area by the 
Mayor of Baton Rouge. Vacant lots presumably owned by 
Exxon, Favaro has observed, are now being sold to provide 
stand alone homes for low income (Black) families. 
 
19:08 
Favaro reflects on the changes. “In the old days you either 
worked hard and owned your own house, or you just rented 
from somebody. Now days you get the free house.”

When Favaro’s father was still alive the plan at one point 
was to build rental houses on the family’s seven empty lots. 
They built the first rental house then abandoned the whole 
scheme after troubles with the initial renter. Favaro talks 
more about family properties in the area lost to the new 
freeway, along with other questionable property acquisition 
schemes by the city. 
  
21:48 
White flight to the suburbs by area residents (majority of 
males worked at the Exxon facility nearby) is almost total. 
When whites left, Blacks replaced them. Favaro comments 
that Blacks living in the area today with the trash in the yard 
are a different caliber from the Blacks who lived in the area 
when he was growing up. Mentality today is when Blacks 
move in, property values decline. “Property in this area is 
not worth two cents,” Favaro declared. 
 
23:19 
The Favaro business name is known throughout Baton 
Rouge and beyond. “My brother’s keeping on the tradition 
of, you know, cheap…we call it my brother’s charity 
(laughs).” Always somebody coming in the door for a 
handout. Comments on local residents with rent as low as 
$100 per month. Funds left by his daddy enables Bill 
Favaro to keep his rates low. 
 
24:39  
The shop will not continue in the family beyond Bill and 
Sam Favaro. There are no family members to take it over.  
25:11 
More comments about the changes over time. Weller 
Avenue that fronts Favaro’s was once a gravel road. When 
visiting his grandmother around the corner (she lived 
beside a dirt road) Favaro was cautioned by his mother not 
to hit the pillows. It would raise too much dust. His 
grandparents had a player piano for entertainment. They 
also played cards (poker) once a week. Their card table 
now sits in his brother’s kitchen. Favaro speaks to the 
tradition within the family of passing down furnishings. 
 
27:11 
Favaro shares background on his first name. Hypolite is 
pronounced “Hip-ō-līte.” The name is Italian in origin. He is 
named after his grandfather. “Hippolyte was actually a saint 
in the cathedral right here in the city,” Favaro observed. 
Favaro’s two cousins also bear the name Hypolite, but as 
their second names.

Closing comments: “My brother will keep [the business] up 
until he dies, I’m sure...you have to like to do it...it’s not 
something that you’re going to get material out of...wealth 
or anything...but he [Bill Favaro] gets the satisfaction of 
seeing stuff fixed, and what have you, and that’s what he 
likes to do.” Sam and their sister continue to help out 
without a drawing a salary, as does Jeffrey, a neighbor who 
is a retired mechanic. Jeffrey worked for Mr. Favaro, Sr., 
when he was a boy.
