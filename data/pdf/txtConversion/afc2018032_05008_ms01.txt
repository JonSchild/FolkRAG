Introduction 
0.00.24 
She states she was born in Waukesha, Wisconsin. She came to Madison for 
college. She notes that she wasn’t necessarily interested in nursing, but her father 
encouraged her to go to college. He said, “You can’t rely on someone to take care 
of you. You may choose to marry, you may not choose to marry, but you need to 
be able to take care of yourself.”

She talks about graduating high school and brief career counseling “of 60 seconds 
each.” She majored in psychology and received a B.A. in 1977 at UW-Madison. 
“Learned pretty quickly the job I could get with that degree was a really excellent 
job at Gino’s downtown on State Street.” Reports that no one had explained that 
with a BA in psych she’d need to really get a higher degree. 
0.03.04 
She took a first aid class while working as a waitress; she completed a one-year 
program and became an LPN. She worked a couple of years in psych as an LPN. 
“I always knew I wanted to do psych nursing.”  
0.04.32 
She talks about her first job in nursing. She tells her students that there are many 
opportunities in nursing, lots of openings, flexible hours, you can work anywhere. 
She applied for the State; she began working at Mendota Mental Health Institute. 
0.05.50 
In the late 70s, she says, there were various units at Mendota: acute, children’s, 
geriatric, and several forensic units. Reports that this was a big change for her, 
“The State was a huge cultural transition. I was very naïve going into that.” 
0.06.34 
Jenny describes her first day at Mendota. “You walk through the door and you 
hear this big clang behind you and you’re literally locked in, because the patients 
are as well. I remember someone coming up to me and saying, ‘Do you have a 
match?’ I paused and looked at the other staff and I thought, ‘No one is really 
looking for a match.’ … Then the person who’d asked me said, ‘You shouldn’t 
give me a match, I’m a patient.’” States the patients recognized new staff and 
“gave us a hard time.”  
0.07.24 
She talks about the senior staff and learning from older nurses. “Looking back, it 
is what I would consider now to be a very unhealthy culture.” She worked p.m.

shifts and describes the nurses’ surprisingly lax schedule. She talks about how the 
nurses took long breaks at a diner nearby. “I would be looking at my watch 
thinking ‘We’ve been gone more than an hour now.’” “That was very confusing 
for me … You didn’t want to ask a lot of questions because I could sense right 
away there was a definite hierarchy in the pm shift. I had watched a couple new 
nurses start there. It was pretty sobering and scary. LPNs were never in charge, 
we weren’t even called nurses back then. It was the RNs who were in charge of 
the shift and they would come on board, they’d make assignments. I remember 
one, at the end of a shift, we were all sitting around charting, it was paper charts 
in our laps and writing, we each had maybe 6 or 7 patients, and she decided to 
over some constructive feedback to one of the psych aides … It was within ear 
shot of all us, but it wasn’t horrible criticism … He got really red in the face and 
he got in her face and he said, ‘Don’t you ever tell me how to do my charting or 
when I hear you screaming down the hall I will walk and not run to help you.’” 
She describes her disappointment in some of her coworkers.  
0.11.55 
Jenny talks a bit about the union at Mendota and how performance reviews were 
organized. She states she came in with a pro-union mindset but did not feel after a 
while positive towards the union. “These people ruined it for everyone else. There 
were people there that were so burned out. They hated the work, but they didn’t 
feel like they could go any place else and make that kind of money.” Describes 
the environment at times as toxic.  
0.13.19 
She talks about working with the forensic patients where they hadn’t gone to 
prison for crimes but had mental illness and served time in psychiatric location. 
“Oddly, I transferred to forensics to be safer physically when I wanted to have a 
child.” She talks about starting on an acute admissions unit, that is the patients 
were actively psychotic, brought in for evaluation. They were often out of control. 
Describes getting attacked on this unit. The forensic unit she went to was where 
“the men had shown over a period of years that they could be trusted. They’d 
moved up units. The unit I was on we played spades, we played pool … There 
wasn’t any therapy going on in the evenings. It literally was card tournaments. I 
learned to play cards. It was so weird when I look back on it.”  
0.15.00 
Describes her routine on the evening shifts; sometimes forced to work overtime if 
night shift staff called in. “Everything was by seniority there.” She talks about 
getting engaged and how hard it was for her to get some time off to get married 
because none of the staff that had summer vacations would give them up for her 
to get married in July. “For years, I worked every holiday.” She states she did get 
very generous maternity leave. As a less senior person, she says, “There was no 
empathy. The unspoken thing was, and sometimes it was spoken, if you stay with 
the State 10 years, you’ll never leave.” 
0.17.20 
She talks about leaving Mendota as a new psychiatric hospital opened up in 
Madison; this was 1989, almost her 10-year anniversary at Mendota. “That was 
very much a career change.” She describes the new program. She had gotten her 
RN during time at Mendota where she felt like she couldn’t ever make changes. 
At the new hospital, she felt very creative and was excited to try out things at the 
new hospital. This was Parkway hospital (not open now); it was for profit.

0.19.22 
“It was very disorganized, but those of that really had ideas … they were 
welcomed. That was so refreshing for me.” She describes more about the hospital: 
different units; organization, administration. “That’s where I felt I really 
blossomed.” The hospital was only open about 5 years, not making enough 
money.  
0.21.40 
Jenny talks about some mentors she met at Parkway. She moved from evening 
shifts, “A few of us went out for drinks, we designed a whole new staffing plan.” 
They’d had issues with staff calling in; they put their plan into place, and it 
worked out well.  She became manager of adolescent unit.  
0.22.50 
“I loved the management side of it … For me, that was just really … it brought in 
I love teaching. It was coaching; it was being able to, I guess, provide my staff all 
the things that I wished I had gotten in my 10 years at Mendota. I really wanted 
people to feel like they have an impact on their work. Like they feel they can give 
feedback … At least, they would feel like they were heard.” Describes it as a 
“growth time for me.”  
0.23.48 
She talks about working with adolescents and the training that she received at 
Parkway to manage a unit of youth. “The shift is very much dependent on the 
personalities of the staff who work there. Some of them do a great job; some of 
them don’t. Some of them shoot from the hip and therapize when they really 
shouldn’t be. Psychiatry and social work and the therapies, I think sometimes 
draw in what we call ‘wounded healer.’ They come into the profession because 
they have a lot of unresolved issues of their own. Then they, in working in the 
jobs, they get to inadvertently or subconsciously play out some of this.” These 
groups often worked pm shifts or nights.  
0.25.44 
She says she liked the adolescent unit and she learned a lot. It was different from 
the forensic unit where there, “You really had to get past some of that [what they 
had done].” Talks about reading their charts and about their crimes, “you just 
don’t know if you can deal with the person.” She notes that often in their past 
there was trauma when they were children. If you see the world as dangerous and 
unsafe then you might act out in negative or dangerous ways. This idea helps you 
see different points of view. 
0.27.26 
Jenny “You have to compartmentalize.” 
 
Charitie “Who am I playing cards with?” 
 
Jenny “Exactly … for me, I had to take that, figure out how I felt about it, and 
then put it on the shelf to be able to get through those shifts and have humor with 
people and not just want to be there.” She found value there and stayed, but others 
struggled. “We had a staff person commit suicide while I was at work. We had 
people escape with patients. We had staff people slashing other staff peoples’ 
tires.”  
0.28.40 
Talks about how she was struck by how miserable her coworkers were; they 
didn’t feel like they had other options for work. These experiences influenced her 
when she became an RN Manager. 
0.29.54 
She describes the various relationships between nurses and other professions at 
Parkway; “It was very much a team.” The nurses worked with physicians who had 
to “buy in” to the program when they placed a patient on the unit.

0.31.02 
She talks about some of the reasons why children might be inpatient psych. 
“These were severely sick children.” Many had experienced trauma. It was a 
small unit. She did not work that often on that unit. “For both the child and the 
adolescent, it’s the family that you are treating. You are not just treating the child 
because it all has to do with many times the interactions and the schools, we 
would get the schools involved as well.”  
0.32.30 
She states that there was a weight of responsibility and that it was stressful. Often 
went home thinking about the other shifts and staff.  
0.33.20 
She talks about how she dealt with stress, “Well, I went through a divorce, so I 
guess … But a part of that for me was there was already stress.” Describes more 
about her family life and the support gained from them.  
0.34.40 
Parkway closed right before Christmas; discharged all the patients. The closure 
was very stressful. She stayed through the end. She had started graduate school at 
this time. She talks about her financial responsibilities, supporting her children, 
school, and now without a job. States that year was one of most stressful ever.  
0.36.13 
She did MA in management at Cardinal Stritch University. Several staff from 
Parkway started at the same time. Parkway 1989-93; finished grad school 1994; 
short term worked in urology; hired at UW-Health as manager, multi-specialty 
clinic with several different units. “It was a departure. At the time, I thought clinic 
nursing would be really nice because it’s no weekends and no evenings. Being 
divorced, wanting to have a regular schedule then, was very important. I enjoyed 
that; I was there for 10 years.” “People used to say, they still say, do you ever 
miss psych nursing. Well, I’m in management, so it’s all psych nursing” [laughs].  
0.39.00 
Talks about how staff would come to her with personal stressors or issues. She 
describes moving into electronic health records management. In 2003, she moved 
to director role and worked on medical records implementation until she retired in 
2016. “My career definitely evolved over time.”  
0.41.12 
Charitie asks about her nursing philosophy and her approach to being a 
supervisor. “My philosophy is that I always wanted to be the kind of boss that I 
want to have and be the kind of employee that I would like to have work for me.” 
States she feels that she did well; still communicates with staff she managed. If 
staff feel valued, they perform well. “Patients know when they’re being taken care 
of even at a reception level by people who don’t enjoy their work.”  
0.43.10 
She talks about changes in nursing over the years. One consistent issue in nursing, 
she says, is that staffing is never enough because “people want to find saving. Can 
we get by with less staff?” She talks about how she managed her clinics; she 
employed a lot of part-time staff which gave her a lot of flexibility. After she left, 
clinic moved to prefer full-time staff.  
0.46.08 
She talks about how UW Health changed and grew; became more complex and 
one issue that made her look forward to retirement. Things seemed more 
bureaucratic; lack of staff, but many administrators. “I had the most fun, when I 
felt most strongly an advocate for the staff and could come back and say, ‘this is 
what you asked for and this is what I was able to get.’”  
0.48.53 
She describes stressors for nurses. One is the push to get clients to use electronic 
health records. Nurses field increasing phone calls and electronic communication. 
“Patients want to talk to a nurse, and they should have a nurse answer questions.” 
Page 5 of 7 
 
Talks about work in the clinic with her team of nurses and medical assistant. “As 
we started to look at role definition as an organization, it was deemed that 
rooming a patient does not require an RN level of education. So, the RNs were 
shifted more to be on the phone, triage the calls, answer MyChart questions that 
are clinical. For a lot of RNs, that’s not where they found their joy. They found 
their joy in welcoming that patient that they knew and chatting with them while 
they roomed the patient and catching up a little because they knew these patients. 
They didn’t want to be stuck in a little room doing triage calls.” This caused some 
nurses to quit; affected job satisfaction. “Maybe you didn’t care if you were 
‘optimized.’” She notes that some decisions can be at odds with recruitment 
needs.  
0.52.00 
She describes disconnect between UW nursing school and UW Health; not hiring 
the new nurses. Tried to do a residency program with new graduates with a 
preceptor (mentor), but that didn’t last. Talks about her stepdaughter in a nursing 
program; school is connected to hospital and can get loans forgiven if she works 
for the hospital after graduation.  
0.53.59 
Charitie asks follow-up about nursing unions. She talks about changes in unions 
via Governor Scott Walker. “I still consider myself pro-union.” She talks about 
some of the disfunctions of the union at Mendota and among the nurses working 
there; staff planning who would call in on what days. “It really showed me how 
strong a work culture can be in terms of just bringing people along. Things you 
normally wouldn’t agree with or be comfortable with, you just ‘Well, that’s how 
we do it here.’”  
0.56.21 
“Just like there are for physicians, I think there is definitely a spoken, or 
unspoken, hierarchy, if you will. The hospital nurses, I think particularly in 
surgical specialties, transplant, I think they see themselves as the true expert 
nurses, the highest skilled, maybe even emergency room, trauma. So, then there’s 
this transition from the hospital, 24-hour day nurses, even if they don’t work all 
three shifts, they are hospital nurses, going to the clinic for the quote ‘easy’ jobs. 
Because those clinic nurses aren’t working evenings and weekends. Of course, 
they make a lot less money, and a lot of times people make that change because it 
is quality of life issue. The perception is that it’s gonna be easy, but then they 
come there and they find out, wow this really isn’t easy. It’s not easy to call back 
80 patients in a day. It’s very busy; it’s very high stress. The staffing is lighter. 
Just psych in general, across the medical field, is thought of as … Psychiatrists 
and psych nurses are kinda wacky. You’ll hear that. They don’t pull in the money 
for the organization. A lot of this hierarchy is based on who pulls money into an 
organization, and it’s usually the surgical areas, then the medical specialties, and 
peds and psychiatry at the bottom.”  
0.58.36 
Affordable Care [Act] has changed some of this; also changes in management of 
population of health. Areas that “bring in the most money are actually costing the 
most money for the insurers.” She talks about shifts in health care; focus on 
health, not sickness. Older patients cost the most money; conversations about end 
of life discussions. She sees it as something we fight against rather than being in 
the best interest of the patient sometimes.  
Page 6 of 7 
 
01.00.31 
She talks about a shift to preventative care from global health perspective; 
handwashing, immunizations, decrease use of antibiotics, etc. Doing education for 
the patient rather than prescribing medication. Having conversations with families 
about medical devices for their elderly relatives. She brings up issues with 
oncology and cancer treatment; quality of life versus extension of life. “The focus 
on prevention and having patients set goals, that’s a really cool idea … It’s all 
around what your problems are. There was a shift happening where you said to 
the patient, ‘What would you like to be doing in 15-20 years?’” Provider looks at 
patients’ goals, empowering the patient. “90% of our healthcare doesn’t happen in 
the doctor’s office. It happens at home.”  
1.05.10 
In mental health, she says, it’s a shift towards looking at stressors, how you deal 
with a little anxiety rather than debilitating, encouraging early treatment for 
depression and “reducing the stigma around getting help. For many of the lesser 
chronic things, I think people are getting help earlier. I think celebrities are 
speaking up which helps a lot.” Public figures talking about their anxiety is 
helpful.  
1.06.11 
Charitie asks her to define stigma. “I think it’s how employers feel. If a 
prospective employee would say, ‘Here’s my story and I have chronic 
depression.’ People will say, ‘I have back issues; I have migraines I might need 
some time off.’ They’re pretty reluctant to say, ‘I have a mental health diagnosis.’ 
Because it sounds scary. People don’t know what that means; are you gonna get 
crazy at work? I think there’s a reluctance to share about it because of how it’s 
received.” She compares physical disability to mental disability, for example 
among children and parent’s with children who have a mental illness. Talks about 
how mental illness gets blamed for tragedies, rather than the lack of treatment. 
Describes some advancement in our attitudes toward bipolar disorders in contrast 
to schizophrenia.  
1.08.57 
“There’s been improvement. NAMI has done a really great job. There has been a 
lot more education. It’s still a club nobody wants to be in.” [laughs]. “It doesn’t 
have to have the fear around it. The more we learn about the better.”
