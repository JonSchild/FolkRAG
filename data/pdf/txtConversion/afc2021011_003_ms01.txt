Dale Baumgartner, Jared Schmidt
Jared Schmidt 00:00
All right. Today is Friday, March 18, 2022. This is Jared Schmidt with Dale Baumgartner, part
two. Dale, do I have your consent to record this interview?
Dale Baumgartner 00:12
You bet!
Jared Schmidt 00:13
Sounds great. Dale, I was wondering, last time, when we spoke, you mentioned your dad was a
dairy farmer. He grew up on a dairy farm.
Dale Baumgartner 00:16
Yeah.
Jared Schmidt 00:16
And I was wondering, how far back does that dairy farming history go in your, in your family?
Was it your grandfather's dairy farmer as well, or?
Dale Baumgartner 00:19
No. My folks moved on to the farm we had there in Hebo [Oregon], which is about four miles
down the road, south through here in 1951. In 1951, they moved on that farm and we milked
28 cows.
D
D
D
28 cows.
Jared Schmidt 00:24
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 00:24
And my dad, my dad, you know, us kids were there for the hired men, you know, to do the
milking cows, and cleaning calf pens, and all that, you know, the normal stuff that needs to be
done on a farm. My dad also worked at the Hebo Cheese Factory.
Jared Schmidt 00:31
Ahh, okay. I was wondering what the connection with the...
Dale Baumgartner 00:32
He actually worked at the Hebo Cheese Factory, you know, clear back in late-50s.
Jared Schmidt 00:34
Okay.
Dale Baumgartner 00:34
So, you know, and then I started there in 1968. So, my dad worked there. And then my uncle,
my uncle, Fritz, was a cheesemaker at Tillamook before there was a, there was there was a
split amongst the farmers.
Jared Schmidt 00:50
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 00:50
I believe it was 1957. So you had Tillamook County Creamery Association,
Jared Schmidt 00:51
Mhm.
D
D
D
D
Dale Baumgartner 00:51
and you had Tillamook Cheese and Dairy Association. So, my uncle, Fritz, was the cheese
maker for the other side. [Both laugh]
Jared Schmidt 00:52
Mkay. So, your dad was on one team and your uncle was on the other?
Dale Baumgartner 01:46
Yes, yes.
Jared Schmidt 01:49
How did that relationship work out?
Dale Baumgartner 02:04
You can't let things like that ruin a family or anything, you know.
Jared Schmidt 02:07
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 02:09
So, it worked out. You know, and then, in 1969, they went under, and we took over, and then
Fritz lost his job there at the factory, and we moved up there.
Jared Schmidt 02:18
Mkay.
Dale Baumgartner 02:18
All of our little factories moved up there, and took over the big plant up there.
D
D
D
D
D
Jared Schmidt 02:21
Okay.
Dale Baumgartner 02:22
So, really, cheesemaking. You know, my dad, me, and my uncle, all three of us were in the
cheese industry.
Jared Schmidt 02:29
That's interesting. Where did they learn to make cheese from. Because, you said you to
Tillamook in '51, you said, or?
Dale Baumgartner 02:33
Well, we moved on to the farm in 1951. I mean, my dad milked cows, plus, he worked at
cheese factory also, you know.
Jared Schmidt 03:14
Okay.
Dale Baumgartner 03:15
And, and, you know, he wasn't, he was just a grunt just like I was when I started, you know.
Jared Schmidt 03:22
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 03:22
Just do whatever you need to do. And, you know. But Fritz, uh, you know, I think it's just...You
know, if you have, if you have some initiative, and you want to learn something, you can learn
it.
Jared Schmidt 03:36
Mhm.
D
D
D
D
Dale Baumgartner 03:37
You know, it's, like, almost any job, you can, you know, you can go as far as you want, you
know, if you want to put some effort into you can learn anything you want. And, you know,
what I found out, over the years, really, when I, especially when I took over in 1996, April of
1996, as the head cheesemaker here at Tillamook. And, you know, what I found out was, you
know, these salesman and all the, you know, you got to salesman, you got other cheese
makers from other companies that, you know, that travel around, you know. I mean, you're not
going to give away your secrets, but, at the same time, I found it really...you can sit down in
your office at work.
Jared Schmidt 04:32
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 04:33
The two of you, and shoot the breeze, and it doesn't, you don't learn much.
Jared Schmidt 04:41
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 04:42
But, you can say, "Well, let's, let's go to dinner here tonight at six o'clock. We'll meet at six
o'clock up here, you know, at this restaurant," or whatever, you know, and. Most, most of the,
most of the salesmen that come to Tillamook, when they come to Tillamook, they want to go
they want to have salmon, or oysters, or something like this. So, they want to go to a nice
restaurant around here and eat, you know. But I found that, that's where you learn the most.
Jared Schmidt 05:10
Mkay.
Dale Baumgartner 05:10
That's where, that's where everybody, you know, you're relaxed, you're just shooting the
breeze. And that's where you really learn it. That's where I, I came to really look forward to
those, those dinners where, you know, you opened up and even, even when I was at the
Boardman plant working over there, you know, the, the salesman would come to Tillamook and
then they'd come to Boardman, or they'd come to Boardman and then Tillamook. And they
D
D
D
D
would stop in at Boardman, and go to dinner with them down to River Lodge, and it was. It's
very, you can learn a lot just going out to dinner and just shooting the breeze, and so that
you're up on what's going on out there in the industry.
Jared Schmidt 05:44
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 05:44
And I learned, I learned a lot right there. And I mean, I've even taken cheese over there to
Boardman and had it there. And we met down there at the River Lodge for dinner that night,
and I actually had some cheese there that I cut up and brought into the restaurant there, just to
you know, to, you know, have them critique it and whatnot.
Jared Schmidt 05:44
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 05:44
And you know, I mean, that's where you learn a lot.
Jared Schmidt 05:48
Right.
Dale Baumgartner 05:48
It was, it was really good. I mean, it's not something I really, that's not my nature, but at the
same time, I knew that's where you learn it.
Jared Schmidt 06:05
Is just by casual conversation.
Dale Baumgartner 06:07
Yeah, absolutely.
D
D
D
D
Jared Schmidt 06:08
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 06:08
You know, that's when, that's when they start talking a lot more, when everybody's just relaxed
and eaten and shooting the breeze.
Jared Schmidt 06:18
Mhm. You said you worked alongside your dad, then, at the Creamery?
Dale Baumgartner 06:46
No, I didn't work beside my dad.
Jared Schmidt 06:48
Okay.
Dale Baumgartner 06:48
My dad worked there in the 50s. And then...he didn't work there...I don't think he worked there
more than half a dozen years.
Jared Schmidt 06:57
Okay.
Dale Baumgartner 06:57
And then he went to work at the plug mill. So...
Jared Schmidt 06:58
The plug mill?
Dale Baumgartner 07:01
Yeah.
D
D
D
D
D
Jared Schmidt 07:02
What's a plug mill?
Dale Baumgartner 07:03
They made them wooden plugs that go in the end of paper rolls.
Jared Schmidt 07:08
Oh! That's cool.
Dale Baumgartner 07:10
Yeah.
Jared Schmidt 07:10
Where was that at, then?
Dale Baumgartner 07:11
That was right down there in Hebo, too.
Jared Schmidt 07:13
Okay.
Dale Baumgartner 07:14
Anyway, and, you know, I mean, he just needed to supplement, you know, your income from
the farm, you know.
Jared Schmidt 07:19
How big was Hebo when you were a kid? Because now Hebo is, what? 300, 200 people? [2020
population is 130].
D
D
D
D
Dale Baumgartner 07:24
I don't even know if it's over that.
Jared Schmidt 07:24
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 07:28
You know, there was three service stations. There were three service stations here at one time,
two grocery stores, a sporting goods store, two restaurants. Just amazing.
Jared Schmidt 07:47
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 07:47
And it's just going right into the ground, you know?
Jared Schmidt 07:50
Yeah. Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 07:51
Just not much there now or, you know.
Jared Schmidt 07:53
Yeah. My hometown, kind of same situation.
Dale Baumgartner 07:58
Yeah, my dad quit there and they're going to the plug mill. Then, I came along in 1968, and
started there. My dad was on the board of directors for the Hebo Cheese Factory. And, you
know, I started there and, and in the very beginning of June of 1968.
Jared Schmidt 08:17
Mkay. So when your dad switched from the work on the cream, or the Creamery in Hebo to the
D
D
D
D
D
Mkay. So when your dad switched from the work on the cream, or the Creamery in Hebo to the
plug factory, was he still milking cows?
Dale Baumgartner 08:24
Still milking cows, or I was. [Laughs]
Jared Schmidt 08:26
You were, you were the one doing it, yeah. He owned them, you...
Dale Baumgartner 08:29
Yeah, yeah, he owned them. [Laughs]
Jared Schmidt 08:32
When did you, was this family, was it a family farm that he'd grown up on as well. Or was it?
Dale Baumgartner 08:37
I grew up, I grew up there from day one.
Jared Schmidt 08:39
And then, did he grew up on that same farm, too, or? Did your dad grew up on that farm, too?
Dale Baumgartner 08:45
Oh, no, no, no. My dad grew up on, actually, it's actually on, out there but the airbase.
Jared Schmidt 08:52
Oh, okay.
Dale Baumgartner 08:52
When you go down Long Prairie Road
Jared Schmidt 08:54
D
D
D
D
D
Jared Schmidt 08:54
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 08:54
you will come to Baumgartner Road. [Laughs]
Jared Schmidt 08:58
So that's you guys.
Dale Baumgartner 08:58
My dad, that's where my dad grew up on, on a farm right there.
Jared Schmidt 09:03
Baumgartner Road, okay.
Dale Baumgartner 09:04
Yeah. Yeah.
Jared Schmidt 09:06
That's funny. So, did you, does your family, like, when did your family arrive until him a county,
then?
Dale Baumgartner 09:13
Boy. [Laughs] Oh, man. You know, you know, like my, we're Swiss. My dad's side of the family
is all Swiss. My mom's side of the family was all Swiss.
Jared Schmidt 09:25
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 09:25
They came over from Switzerland, you know. I can't actually tell you just exactly what day.
D
D
D
D
D
Jared Schmidt 09:31
Right.
Dale Baumgartner 09:31
It had to be an early though.
Jared Schmidt 09:33
Yeah, okay.
Dale Baumgartner 09:34
Yeah, because my grandpa, my grandpa on my mom's side, had a farm right there,
just...There's a road goes up Munson Creek.
Jared Schmidt 09:44
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 09:45
The very next, there's a, I think it's a yellow house there. That very next farm, he had that farm
right there. [Laughs]
Jared Schmidt 09:53
Okay. So your family's been in this county for quite a while, then.
Dale Baumgartner 09:55
Oh, yes. Yes. Yeah.
Jared Schmidt 09:56
And then, you said your dad also made cheese, and your uncle made cheese. Was there
anybody else, like, in your family that was cheese making? Or were they the first cheese
making generation in your family?
D
D
D
D
Dale Baumgartner 10:08
Yeah, I think so, that I know of. Yes.
Jared Schmidt 10:10
Okay.
Dale Baumgartner 10:10
Yes. Just the three of us, yeah.
Jared Schmidt 10:11
Okay. And then, after your dad started working at the plug mill, and you were, you graduated
high school, did he sell the farm? Or is it still in the family, or?
Dale Baumgartner 10:12
Yeah. No, I started, I started, I started at the Hebo Cheese Factory in 1968.
Jared Schmidt 10:27
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 10:27
And that was when I was a junior, between my junior and senior year in high school.
Jared Schmidt 10:31
Okay.
Dale Baumgartner 10:32
And then we ended up selling the cows, in...we ended up selling the cows at the end of 1968.
Jared Schmidt 10:42
Okay.
D
D
D
D
D
Okay.
Dale Baumgartner 10:43
That was when things were going from milk cans to Grade A.
Jared Schmidt 10:50
Yeah, we talked about that last time.
Dale Baumgartner 10:52
And you either had to put in a bulk tank and spend some money on the farm
Jared Schmidt 10:55
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 10:56
and putting in a bulk tank and cool your milk and all that. Or you went out of business. And it
was, my dad was still working at the plug mill and, and he, they just sold, they sold the cows.
They sold off the cows.
Jared Schmidt 11:10
Okay.
Dale Baumgartner 11:11
My brother, my brother still lives there.
Jared Schmidt 11:13
On the farm.
Dale Baumgartner 11:14
Yeah.
D
D
D
D
D
Jared Schmidt 11:15
Oh, okay. I was wondering what happened to...
Dale Baumgartner 11:16
Yeah, he still lives there.
Jared Schmidt 11:18
Okay.
Dale Baumgartner 11:18
Yeah.
Jared Schmidt 11:18
That's cool. And then, what was it like...with only...So, coming from where I am, where I see
farms with, like, hundreds of cows, or coming from here with hundreds of cows, too. What was
it like growing up in the '60s, or in that time, and and, growing up on a farm, with, you know,
those, such small cows in this, you know, really lush area? What was it like as a kid doing that
kind of dairy work?
Dale Baumgartner 11:43
Well, you know, I mean, it just seemed like everybody in the county, you know, goes off of a
dairy farm, pert near. And, and you know, if you were, if you're raised on a dairy farm you are,
you knew how to work.
Jared Schmidt 12:00
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 12:01
And, you know, that was one of the things that the Creamery, if a kid came in and said, "Hey, I
need to, I'm looking for a job," or whatever and he told you that he was off a dairy farm you just
jumped right on him because you knew he was gonna know how to work.
Jared Schmidt 12:16
D
D
D
D
Jared Schmidt 12:16
Mkay.
Dale Baumgartner 12:17
You know, and, and you know, that...I would have to say,that really worked up until, you know,
once everything went Grade A, and you got into, say, there was a lot of small farms clear into
the '80s and '90s, still.
Jared Schmidt 12:36
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 12:37
And then, but by that time, I'm gonna say by the end of the '90s, by that time, most of the
farmers farms have gotten so big that there was a lot of, most of the farms had several hired
men that were doing that.
Jared Schmidt 12:55
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 12:55
And, and I would have to say, things kind of reversed.
Jared Schmidt 12:58
Okay.
Dale Baumgartner 13:00
I mean, to the point where, like, say in the, say in 2005, or somebody came in, said they were
off a dairy farm, you probably wouldn't even... You know, what's happened. What's happened is
we've gone from a dairy farm where you, as a kid or whatever you grew up in, you got to go
milk cows in the morning ,and you got to milk them in the evening, you got chores to do all
day. To the hired man is doing the milking and the kids off the farms, nowadays, don't even
know what a continuous eight-hour a day of work is.
Jared Schmidt 13:09
Hmm. Yeah.
D
D
D
D
Hmm. Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 13:43
It's, you know, go down, maybe mess around the barn for a while, and then go eat breakfast,
and then come back and mess around some more.
Jared Schmidt 13:50
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 13:50
And, and I've actually seen it work. "Oh, man. Hey! Eight hours straight?" Just, you think you're
punishing them pert near.
Jared Schmidt 13:59
[Laughs] Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 14:01
Yeah.
Jared Schmidt 14:02
Mkay.
Dale Baumgartner 14:02
It's really changed, you know. In fact, actually, I just talked to a, I ran into a farmer this morning
up there in Tillamook, and he's a, he's a pretty big one, you know, and. They're actually,
they've actually gotten too big and producing too much milk. And they're, the Creamery's going
to end up putting a quota on him, now. You know, we, back in the, back in the '70s, you know,
there was a quota.
Jared Schmidt 14:26
Okay.
Dale Baumgartner 14:28
D
D
D
D
D
Dale Baumgartner 14:28
Farms could only produce so much milk because you can only handle so much milk, you know.
There was actually a quota, there was a quota for the farm. And you got paid so much money
for all that quota milk, and anything over the quota milk was paid at a lower price.
Jared Schmidt 14:33
That makes sense. Ooh.
Dale Baumgartner 14:50
So, there was some incentive to stay within your quota, you know.
Jared Schmidt 14:52
Right.
Dale Baumgartner 14:53
So, they're actually, they're actually they were,they're pushing,you know, it it hasn't gone
through yet, but they're a it sounds like it's coming. And, and is to try to control it, because
these guys are just getting too big and there's just, we can only run so much milk.
Jared Schmidt 15:09
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 15:10
You know.
Jared Schmidt 15:11
That makes sense.
Dale Baumgartner 15:12
It costs huge money to haul milk to Boardman or, or to some other plant, you know.
Jared Schmidt 15:17
D
D
D
D
D
Jared Schmidt 15:17
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 15:17
You're paying top dollar, and then now you're gonna turn around and whole it, especially at
today's prices in diesel.
Jared Schmidt 15:23
Yeah, yeah. I mean, I just put in, like $25 worth of my gas regular.
Dale Baumgartner 15:29
Yeah [Laughs]
Jared Schmidt 15:29
And that was half of my little Taurus' gas.
Dale Baumgartner 15:33
Yeah.
Jared Schmidt 15:34
Which I was like, "Oh, good thing Dale doesn't live too far away."
Dale Baumgartner 15:36
Yeah, right. Right.
Jared Schmidt 15:38
Thank you for being close. [Laughs]
Dale Baumgartner 15:38
Yeah. Yeah. I don't know.
D
D
D
D
D
Jared Schmidt 15:44
So, just, so when you were a kid, then, so, I mean, your dad walked you through it. You learned
how to milk cows.
Dale Baumgartner 15:49
Oh yeah.
Jared Schmidt 15:49
Was it all by hand, each cow at that time, still, or?
Dale Baumgartner 15:52
No, no, we had milk machines. But they were the straps over the back. And
Jared Schmidt 15:58
Oh, not the udder ones that are in, like the, the, um...Creamery today?
Dale Baumgartner 16:02
No, no. Oh, no. Ha! [Laughs] They were the manual milking gals.
Jared Schmidt 16:09
Okay.
Dale Baumgartner 16:10
Oh, yeah. [Laughs]
Jared Schmidt 16:11
What were those like? You said you strapped them over, and, how'd that work?
Dale Baumgartner 16:14
You strapped, you strapped...I got a milk can, somewhere, a milk machine. Huh. I got it on
where it is now. You had a strap about this wide, that went over, the over the cows. Right over
D
D
D
D
D
where it is now. You had a strap about this wide, that went over, the over the cows. Right over
the back there.
Jared Schmidt 16:31
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 16:31
Then this milk machine, just, it was just a, it's about this deep [Makes hand gestures
measuring].
Jared Schmidt 16:37
Mkay.
Dale Baumgartner 16:37
And about that big around,
Jared Schmidt 16:38
So like, what, maybe six inches?
Dale Baumgartner 16:41
I'm gonna say, I'm gonna say, somewhere between eight and ten inches deep.
Jared Schmidt 16:46
Mkay.
Dale Baumgartner 16:47
And it'll probably hold, it'd probably hold about 50-60 pounds of milk.
Jared Schmidt 16:52
Oh, really? Okay.
D
D
D
D
Dale Baumgartner 16:53
I'm guessing it holds fairly close to that.
Jared Schmidt 16:55
Okay.
Dale Baumgartner 16:56
Maybe not quite. But, anyway, it hung on there. And then it had, it had four teat cups on it,
there, and you, you actually washed the gutter, and then you, you actually put on each one. It'd
vacuum.
Jared Schmidt 17:09
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 17:09
Vacuum, and milk cow, you know. You know, every cow...Like every cow, ha, like on our farm.
Jared Schmidt 17:20
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 17:20
Every cow had a name.
Jared Schmidt 17:22
Mkay.
Dale Baumgartner 17:23
Every cow had their own stanchion.
Jared Schmidt 17:25
Mhm.
D
D
D
D
D
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 17:26
When they came in the barn, they knew where they were going.
Jared Schmidt 17:30
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 17:30
They just wasn't just mixed up all over.
Jared Schmidt 17:32
Nice.
Dale Baumgartner 17:33
And, you know, you knew, oh, this cow might milk faster than maybe it milks real fast. This one
here milks slower, you know, you get to wear you know, well, this one here, yeah, put it on, put
it, put it on, you know, it's going to be about, you know, five minutes, you know, when you
come back and check udder. You know, you just have to, just what you have to do, you know.
Jared Schmidt 17:56
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 17:57
And, and then you take, then you take the milk machine off, the lid comes off, and you poured
the, you poured the milk in a stainless steel bucket.
Jared Schmidt 18:07
Right.
Dale Baumgartner 18:08
And then you went on, to, move the next cow, put a machine on it.
D
D
D
D
D
Jared Schmidt 18:12
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 18:12
While you put the machine on it, you'd go grab that bucket of milk there, and you take it to the
milk house. And you had a tank about this [Makes hand measurement] about 10 to 12 inches
tall, about this long, and about probably 12 inches wide.
Jared Schmidt 18:32
Mkay.
Dale Baumgartner 18:33
And you dumped the milk in that.
Jared Schmidt 18:35
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 18:35
And then, right underneath it, it had a spigot on it.
Jared Schmidt 18:39
Mkay.
Dale Baumgartner 18:40
And you'd adjust that spicket, so it'd just run kind of slowly, the milk would run out of that tank
slowly.
Jared Schmidt 18:46
Mhm.
D
D
D
D
Dale Baumgartner 18:47
And it was, there was a tube about this long [Measures with hands]. About yay wide.
Jared Schmidt 18:52
So 3 by...
Dale Baumgartner 18:52
It had cold water, you had the cold water hose hooked to it. So cold water was running through
it.
Jared Schmidt 18:59
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 19:00
And as the milk would go down, it would, it was running over these, these, it was, you know...
Jared Schmidt 19:07
Like a coil, kind of?
Dale Baumgartner 19:08
Coil, kind of coil, and it would cool, it would cool in the milk.
Jared Schmidt 19:11
Ah.
Dale Baumgartner 19:12
And when it got down to the bottom of that, that came right together, and you had your 10
gallon milk and right underneath it, and it ran right into the milk can.
Jared Schmidt 19:21
Huh.
D
D
D
D
D
Huh.
Dale Baumgartner 19:21
And then you'd take that milk and when it got full, and take it over and put it in the water pit.
[Both laugh] And that was how you cooled the milk.
Jared Schmidt 19:30
It sounds a little bit like a whiskey distillery, almost, a little bit [Dale laughs], when you're
talking about the coils and everything.
Dale Baumgartner 19:35
Yeah, yeah.
Jared Schmidt 19:36
So, how much, maybe this is a silly question. But, like, when you're milking a cow, how much,
on average, how much milk would come out of a single cow?
Dale Baumgartner 19:43
Oh, I would say...You know, back then, you know, the farms went into the certain grains and
you just fed grain and you just fed hay. It wasn't any science behind much of anything back
then.
Jared Schmidt 19:57
Right.
Dale Baumgartner 19:58
I would, I would have to say, a really good milking cow would be, probably somewhere between
25-30 pounds.
Jared Schmidt 20:05
25 or 30 pounds of milk.
Dale Baumgartner 20:07
D
D
D
D
D
Dale Baumgartner 20:07
A really good. Yeah, yeah. A milking...
Jared Schmidt 20:09
Each time.
Dale Baumgartner 20:10
Yeah.
Jared Schmidt 20:10
Two times a day.
Dale Baumgartner 20:11
Yes. Right.
Jared Schmidt 20:12
Seven days a week, right?
Dale Baumgartner 20:13
Yeah. Yeah,
Jared Schmidt 20:14
Just a little bit of milk, just a hint.
Dale Baumgartner 20:16
[Laughs] Yeah. And that was a, that was a good milking cow. Yeah.
Jared Schmidt 20:21
Okay. What kind of cows did you raise? What what breed?
D
D
D
D
D
Dale Baumgartner 20:23
You know, we had, we had a lot of jerseys. We had, I'm gonna say we had about a half dozen
Holsteins, and then we had a couple of Guernseys.
Jared Schmidt 20:37
Okay.
Dale Baumgartner 20:37
But, you know the Holsteins are a much bigger cow, stockier, they give more milk
Jared Schmidt 20:44
Okay.
Dale Baumgartner 20:44
than a Jersey. But the jersey gives less milk. It's higher, it's milk goes much higher in fat, and
protein than that Holstein's milk.
Jared Schmidt 21:00
Okay.
Dale Baumgartner 21:01
So, you know like, we, we drank farm, milk right off the farm.
Jared Schmidt 21:10
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 21:12
So we had a little, we had probably a little gallon stainless steel milk canned that we take to the
barn. And, you know, like if, say we were getting ready for Easter, or some holiday dinner or
something. And, you know, mom is going to be making, she's already made the pie, and we're
going to have apple pie with fresh whipped cream on it. She would tell us, she would tell us,
"Hey, I'm gonna, I need some whipped cream." So we, we knew we were going to be pulling
Jersey milk just today.
D
D
D
D
D
Jared Schmidt 21:41
Oh, okay.
Dale Baumgartner 21:41
But, elsewise, most of the time, we'd be drinking Holstein milk. We'd actually save particular
milk for what we're gonna do.
Jared Schmidt 21:51
So, was it Jersey were for, uh, for, for dessert.
Dale Baumgartner 21:56
The Jersey, yeah. Yeah, Jersey for dessert [Laughs].
Jared Schmidt 21:59
Jersey's a dessert cow.
Dale Baumgartner 22:00
Yeah.
Jared Schmidt 22:02
I like that. What, If you were to drive around today, what's the most kind of, common cow you
would see on a dairy farm in Tillamook?
Dale Baumgartner 22:10
I think, right now, probably almost the majority of cows in Tillamook County, now, are probably
Jerseys. You know, we went to, we went, pretty much, to almost, probably, I wouldn't be
surprised if it was 80% Holsteins back in, oh the '80s and '90s. I'm gonna say, I'm gonna say
the first, the first ten years of 2000, between 2000 and 1010,
Jared Schmidt 22:18
Jerseys. Mhm.
D
D
D
D
Jerseys. Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 22:46
the shift has been to the Jersey side of things. They're, they're smaller animals. They take up
less room in, in the milking parlor, and in the holding pens and whatnot.
Jared Schmidt 22:49
Mkay. Right.
Dale Baumgartner 23:00
They eat less feed, the whole works. And the fat and protein is higher in their milk. And they,
the farmers are getting more money for their milk by having those attributes.
Jared Schmidt 23:14
By having Jerseys.
Dale Baumgartner 23:14
Yes.
Jared Schmidt 23:15
Okay.
Dale Baumgartner 23:15
And, you know, it's, it's made, it made work, for me at work, though.
Jared Schmidt 23:25
Hmm.
Dale Baumgartner 23:25
The switches made, the switch actually made work at the cheese maker's end of things. It
made work, it made more work for the cheese maker.
D
D
D
D
D
Jared Schmidt 23:33
Why is that?
Dale Baumgartner 23:35
Because you, you can't, you can't make super high quality cheese with just with just Jersey
milk. Because the fat, the fat in that is too high in there. And you get, you, your the chances for
off flavors is much, much higher. The higher the fat is. So, so, we actually ended up
standardizing our milk in Tillamook. I don't know if they want to talk about that.
Jared Schmidt 24:10
Right, we can...
Dale Baumgartner 24:11
But we actually standardized the milk
Jared Schmidt 24:15
As far as, like, percentage of which cow is contributing, or?
Dale Baumgartner 24:19
Well, what's fortunate is ,ou know, you get let's say you got a hundred farmers, now, and you
got, we got 250,000 pound silos there at work. And, you know, trucks are coming in, you know,
this trucks got 40,000, this ones got 50,000 on it.
Jared Schmidt 24:42
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 24:43
You mix them, you put them in a silo, you know. And we actually, we actually, at one time, we
were actually printing out. We were actually printing out a piece of paper for the milk receiving
operators because milk receiving was part of my, mine, too.
Jared Schmidt 25:01
D
D
D
D
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 25:02
So weigh, this farmer's, you know, this is real high fat milk here, this is lower fat. So, we try to
get them, to milk receivers, to mix, you know,
Jared Schmidt 25:14
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 25:15
mix loads into different, certain silos, So, that we wouldn't have a silo with all Jersey milk, and
then a silo with all Holstein milk. Which may come to cause me a problem, too! [Jared laughs]
Try to get it, and then, we were actually adding, we actually had it set up to where we could
actually add fat to the milk, or we could actually add some skim milk to the milk to bring the
components down. And that, and that's where, that's where the consistency of Tillamook
cheese comes in.
Jared Schmidt 25:45
Okay.
Dale Baumgartner 25:46
It's because we actually standardize the milk. We don't just make it out of whatever comes out.
We actually standardize it. We have a, we had a ratio, fat to protein. We had a ratio, we will, we
would go out there, take a sample, a silos got 250,000 in it, now, and it's been full for, been full
for a half hour, that little agitators been running in there. We're going to run out there and
we're going to take a sample out of a silo. We're going to take it in, run it on, run the
components on, on a standardizer, and we're going to find out what fat and protein whatnot in
there. And we're going to figure out whether we need to add cream to that, to that silo of milk,
or we need to add skim, so that all 30 vats of cheese today are going to have pretty much the
same...the milk that goes into them vats is all going to be pretty much the same a fat-to-
protein ratio. And, you know, this, the medium cheddar, we're going to use, we're going to use
a different fat-to-protein, then the sharp.
Jared Schmidt 26:12
Mhm. Mkay.
Dale Baumgartner 26:55
D
D
D
D
Dale Baumgartner 26:55
Or, say we're going to make Monterrey, now we're going to change, or we had, we had, we had
it all figured out for each recipe.
Jared Schmidt 27:04
Okay. I was gonna ask you, because also the sharp, the white sharp cheddar here is [Points to
white cheddar Dale has on table for them to eat]
Dale Baumgartner 27:10
Yes.
Jared Schmidt 27:10
That's so good.
Dale Baumgartner 27:11
Yeah, yeah.
Jared Schmidt 27:11
I'm saving the
Dale Baumgartner 27:13
Yeah. [Laughs]
Jared Schmidt 27:14
good stuff, or the best stuff, for, obviously.
Dale Baumgartner 27:16
Yes.
Jared Schmidt 27:17
So, there's, so the medium cheddar, so someone goes to Fred Meyers.
D
D
D
D
D
Dale Baumgartner 27:21
Yeah.
Jared Schmidt 27:22
Or Costco, whatever buys a block of, a baby love medium cheddar. It's gonna be milk from,
from Jersey, from, from...
Dale Baumgartner 27:30
Holstein. Guernseys.
Jared Schmidt 27:33
Gurnseys.
Dale Baumgartner 27:34
Could be from any, yeah. Yes, yes, right. Right. Right.
Jared Schmidt 27:35
Okay. But there's a percentage, of like, what's all been done before to figure out, but it's all, it's
all different breeds of cows in that block of cheese. Okay.
Dale Baumgartner 27:45
Yeah. Yeah.
Jared Schmidt 27:46
That's, that's cool. I think a lot of people do think, well, a cow is a cow. And it's like, [Dale
laughs] even I know that!
Dale Baumgartner 27:53
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No, that's, that's, that's what makes, that's what makes the Tillamook cheese
so consistent is, you know, by we, by standardizing our meal. And by, you know, the milk and
by the recipe, standardizing it for the certain recipe and what we want to do with it, you know,
D
D
D
D
D
what our goal is. You know, so that all 30 vats, or whatever we're gonna run today, is all the
same, you know?
Jared Schmidt 27:54
Even I know it's not close. Yeah. Okay.
Dale Baumgartner 28:22
Because, before that, back in, you know, back in the day. Back in the '70s milk came in and you
just, you know, you just made, you just made cheese out of it. [Jared laughs] And, you know, it
wasn't, you know, the consistency wasn't, you know. You use, you know, this-that could be
three quarters Jersey milk, this next one could be three-quarters Holstein milk, or whatever.
Jared Schmidt 28:44
Mkay.
Dale Baumgartner 28:44
And we're actually adding back a lot of fat. And then we found out that, you know, you can only
add so much fat back before you're starting to waste the cream because, you know, the protein
only absorbs so much fat, and a.
Jared Schmidt 28:44
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 28:44
And then, you know, and then it got to where, you know, like, I'd say 80% of it probably was
Holstein milk.
Jared Schmidt 29:09
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 29:10
You know, so, you know. There's a lot of, there's a lot of art to making cheese, believe me. It
isn't...Especially Tillamook cheese, here, quality products, you know.
D
D
D
D
Jared Schmidt 29:20
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 29:22
You don't just, don't put the milk into that and say, "We're going to make cheese here." You
know, to make consistent Tillamook quality cheese, you, there's a lot of, a lot involved in it than
just simply putting milk in a vat.
Jared Schmidt 29:35
Yeah. Every time we speak so far it sounds, you make the cheese process sound so much more
complicated than I think even I knew it was.
Dale Baumgartner 29:43
Oh, it is, it is tremendously complicated. Believe me.
Jared Schmidt 29:47
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 29:47
And then, you know...Out there in the industry, I mean, there's been a lot of talk about, it, but
you cheese color, you know.
Jared Schmidt 29:56
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 29:58
You know, Tillamook chees is lightest cheddar cheese out there on the market, here in the
United States.
Jared Schmidt 30:04
Okay.
D
D
D
D
Dale Baumgartner 30:04
And, you know, we got, you know, back in the '90s, we kind of got into, or 2000, we kind of got
into the, the, you know, messing around with some white cheese, you know. And we made just,
we actually use cafra in it.
Jared Schmidt 30:22
Okay.
Dale Baumgartner 30:23
Which was, you know, that's become a big no, no, now, you know, with environmental issues.
Jared Schmidt 30:30
Mkay.
Dale Baumgartner 30:30
And we've actually, we actually stopped using it, then, just not long before I retired, probably
2015, or something we stopped using. But we, we...I mean, here, in Tillamook, we would almost
say that the color actually effects the aging of the cheese, to some extent.
Jared Schmidt 30:51
Oh.
Dale Baumgartner 30:51
Most people would say, "Oh, bull." [Jared laughs] But I think, we I think we actually almost
proved it to ourselves, you know? And, and, you know, it was a huge deal from going away from
the cafre to make a, you know, that, there I'm sure it's made with cafre in it. And, you know,
we, we, we played around with the other, you know, the other renett for years before we
ever...We just kept making a little bit with it, once in a while, and seeing how it aged out until
we finally figured it out. And, we've actually gone to use just microbial now, but, yeah. It's,
there's a lot to making cheese, believe me. It isn't just simply just go make cheese. [Both
laugh] There's a, there's a whole headache there,
Jared Schmidt 31:39
Yeah.
D
D
D
D
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 31:40
that you, that you just don't see, you know?
Jared Schmidt 31:42
So, how does that compare, then, to, you know, you're saying all these microbial, like,
attributes and percentages of dairy cows, which...How does that compare to when you were
starting off as a cheese maker in Hebo?
Dale Baumgartner 31:56
Oh!
Jared Schmidt 31:57
What was that like?
Dale Baumgartner 31:59
You know, it's just making,it's like, it's just like day and night, really.
Jared Schmidt 32:03
Okay.
Dale Baumgartner 32:03
It's just like day and night. Because, you know, you know there was no consistency, consistency
in the product back then. You know, even, I would have to say, it was beyond,I would say our
consistency was up and down, clear up until 1990.
Jared Schmidt 32:32
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 32:33
And then we put the cheddaring machine in,
D
D
D
D
D
And then we put the cheddaring machine in,
Jared Schmidt 32:37
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 32:37
the automated equipment in. Took us 'til almost 1992, to get it figured out, make adjustments,
and whatnot to the machine. And I would have to say that it wasn't until about 1992 that we
really started seeing the automated equipment...We were consistently producing quality
cheese.
Jared Schmidt 32:46
Mkay.
Dale Baumgartner 32:49
And then, in 1994, we decided, you know, the company decided they wanted to get into the,
really the aged cheddar program.
Jared Schmidt 33:21
Right.
Dale Baumgartner 33:22
And get out there and really market aged cheddar. And then, then the work started on...You
know, you know, every one of these cheeses here has a different moisture content.
Jared Schmidt 33:34
Yeah, okay.
Dale Baumgartner 33:34
Yeah, you know.
Jared Schmidt 33:36
Mhm.
D
D
D
D
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 33:37
And, you know, from some, from 1992 on, it was a matter, of you know, you know, we need one
or two days of cheese aged here,
Jared Schmidt 33:53
Mkay.
Dale Baumgartner 33:54
from our production at Tillamook.
Jared Schmidt 33:56
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 33:57
So, back in the '90s, so may be one or two days of this week's going to be cheesed age, and
the other five days are going to be medium cheddar cheese,
Jared Schmidt 34:07
Mkay.
Dale Baumgartner 34:07
or, or stirred curd, or whatever, you know, your Monterrey, or Pepper Jack, or whatever. And
then, you know, as we went, you know, well, pretty soon we need, pretty soon we need three
days of aged cheddar.
Jared Schmidt 34:23
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 34:24
You know, it was all depended on where our sales were, how much was in sharp, how much
was in medium, and pretty soon it's four days and pretty soon it's five days. And, but you know,
D
D
D
D
D
was in medium, and pretty soon it's four days and pretty soon it's five days. And, but you know,
in order to...You have to be on it, because, if we're going to run cheese aged tomorrow, you
know, we're going to use different rennet, coagulant, we're going to use different moisture,
we're going to use different ratio.
Jared Schmidt 34:49
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 34:49
I mean, there's all that, there, that has to be, you know, you don't want to mess up.
Jared Schmidt 34:55
Yeah, right. And how did that compare to, like, when you were, when you were a kid, or a
teenager?
Dale Baumgartner 35:00
Oh, everything was just medium.
Jared Schmidt 35:02
Everything was just medium.
Dale Baumgartner 35:02
Everything was just medium.
Jared Schmidt 35:03
Okay.
Dale Baumgartner 35:04
Yes, yes. There was hardly anything that ever went to sharp. It was just, it was...You know, we
didn't have, we didn't have good enough controls
Jared Schmidt 35:14
D
D
D
D
Mkay.
Dale Baumgartner 35:15
on our fat, and protein, and all this clear back in those days,
Jared Schmidt 35:20
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 35:20
to really make a quality aged cheddar, you know, really.
Jared Schmidt 35:26
Okay.
Dale Baumgartner 35:26
Something that could age out, you know. I mean, you know, like that cheese, there, 17 years
old.
Jared Schmidt 35:31
Right.
Dale Baumgartner 35:31
You know, I mean, if you had a piece of cheese, there, here, right now that was from, you know,
1970, and you, and you stuck it in your mouth. And say, say it was only 17 years old.
Jared Schmidt 35:44
Right.
Dale Baumgartner 35:44
You know, and it was 1987, and you stuck it in your mouth, you'd [in a hushed voice] probably
be spitting.
D
D
D
D
D
Jared Schmidt 35:50
[Laughs] Really, it was that much of a quality [ILL]?
Dale Baumgartner 35:53
Well, yeah, I think you know, there was there was, you know, there was the, there was the
occasional accident, you know, where it came out good, but it wasn't, it wasn't intentional.
Jared Schmidt 36:02
[Laughs] Right. Okay.
Dale Baumgartner 36:03
It wasn't intentional.
Jared Schmidt 36:04
Okay.
Dale Baumgartner 36:05
And, you know, I mean, you can go down to store and you can buy a whole bunch of these
medium baby loafs, and you can, and you know. I mean, I've heard it out here all, I hear it all
the time out here in public. You know, this Fred Meyers has cheese on sale, you know, $5 or $6
a baby loaf, and they run in there, and they buy ten of them, they stick them in the frigerator,
or some out in their garage or whatever. "Oh, it's going to age excellent! In ten years it's going
to be great!" Well, I'm going to disappoint them, because in ten years, they're probably not
going to be real happy.
Jared Schmidt 36:40
They better just eat it right now.
Dale Baumgartner 36:41
You know, the cheese just doesn't age the same as in a baby loaf size as it does a 40 pound
block.
D
D
D
D
Jared Schmidt 36:48
Right, yeah, you...
Dale Baumgartner 36:49
And, you know, I just know some things that...[Laughs] You know, the medium cheddar cheese
is [clears throat], it's medium for a reason. [Laughs]
Jared Schmidt 36:50
It's best to be enjoyed in the moment, right? Which we are doing right now. Thank you again,
I'm so, I'm so excited about the cheeses again. So, you how many people worked at the Hebo
Cheese Factory?
Dale Baumgartner 37:12
At the Hebo Cheese Factory there were six of us.
Jared Schmidt 37:15
Six of ya?
Dale Baumgartner 37:16
Total of six employees. [Laughs]
Jared Schmidt 37:18
Really?
Dale Baumgartner 37:19
Total of six.
Jared Schmidt 37:21
Wow.
Dale Baumgartner 37:21
D
D
D
D
D
Dale Baumgartner 37:21
Yes. I was grunt. I was a grunt, and there was one other kid that was just, like, one or two years
older than me that worked there, but. You know every...But we shut down Hebo, me...four, four
of those six moved on to the Tillamook plant. The other two dropped out.
Jared Schmidt 37:52
Okay, so you kept going. Well, four of you kept going.
Dale Baumgartner 37:56
Four of us kept going on in the industry, in the cheese industry. And the other two dropped out.
Jared Schmidt 38:00
Mkay.
Dale Baumgartner 38:01
Went to something else.
Jared Schmidt 38:02
Mkay.
Dale Baumgartner 38:02
Yeah.
Jared Schmidt 38:03
It was, were you, you were the youngest, you said, or?
Dale Baumgartner 38:05
Yeah, yeah.
Jared Schmidt 38:05
Okay. What was that like, being like, the grunt, young grunt compared to like, older farming...
D
D
D
D
Dale Baumgartner 38:11
[Dale laughs] You know, I don't know, as though it was really bad because I knew how to work,
you know.
Jared Schmidt 38:17
Right.
Dale Baumgartner 38:17
I grew up on a farm and, you know, you weren't afraid to work.
Jared Schmidt 38:20
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 38:21
I think that's what it comes down to. You know, if you're not afraid to work, you can even work
anywhere. Anybody will hire you if they know you're not afraid of work.
Jared Schmidt 38:31
Right.
Dale Baumgartner 38:31
And, and, but I got stuck with a lot of the shitty jobs, but, you know, that's just, that's just how
it happened, you know.
Jared Schmidt 38:40
Yeah, yeah, climbing the ladder, kind of thing.
Dale Baumgartner 38:41
But at the same time, you know, I was, I was alert enough, or paying attention enough to where
I learned a lot from those years, too.
D
D
D
D
D
Jared Schmidt 38:53
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 38:54
You know.
Jared Schmidt 38:54
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 38:55
It was good, it was good, you know. And then we moved on up to the other plant and, you
know, just carried on from there and just kept learning and learning, you know, and.
Jared Schmidt 39:05
Yeah. What was it like, then, to like to work in these? Like, was it, like, very loud? Was it
Dale Baumgartner 39:10
Oh!
Jared Schmidt 39:10
messy? Was it...
Dale Baumgartner 39:11
You know, my hearing is terrible.
Jared Schmidt 39:13
Okay.
Dale Baumgartner 39:13
You know, I'm, I've got, almost, I'm almost completely deaf in my left ear.
D
D
D
D
D
Jared Schmidt 39:17
Because of the lifetime of the work?
Dale Baumgartner 39:19
Oh, you know. Oh, yeah. You know, you're working around huge, noisy equipment. And, you
know, we didn't...You know, back in the, back in the '60s and the '70s, I don't know, there might
have been OSHA back then, I'm not sure. I honestly don't know. But, you know, there was no
such thing as hearing, hearing, earplugs or
Jared Schmidt 39:39
Yeah. Oh really?
Dale Baumgartner 39:46
whatever, back when we were working then.
Jared Schmidt 39:49
Okay.
Dale Baumgartner 39:49
That was...Hearing protection didn't come along, in my, I'm gonna say it was, it was
somewhere, hell, I'm gonna say, I'm gonna say it was 'til at least the mid-80s.
Jared Schmidt 40:03
Really?
Dale Baumgartner 40:04
Yeah, I'd have to say at the least the mid-80s.
Jared Schmidt 40:06
Huh.
D
D
D
D
Dale Baumgartner 40:07
Before, before, you know, ear plugs and ear muffs, or whatever. And then, you know, I mean,
up until, you know, from 1968 to, say 1985, I just worked around some, some huge noisy
equipment, you know, real loud. It's very, very loud.
Jared Schmidt 40:12
Yeah. Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 40:27
You know, when when, when they, you know, they have that noise meter, you know? Yeah, its
a...
Jared Schmidt 40:35
The decimals and all that were quite, yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 40:35
It's extremely loud, yeah.
Jared Schmidt 40:38
Huh.
Dale Baumgartner 40:38
So, then you know, like, from the, in the '90s, clear to now, you know, now it's mandatory
earplugs, you know, because the noise is so high. The only place we didn't wear earplugs,
really, was back in milk receiving and the ice cream. Yeah.
Jared Schmidt 40:38
Okay. Well, the question I was going to ask is, with the hearing loss aspect, is, were there any,
like, particular injuries you had to, like, be mindful of, or were there any tricks to avoid getting
hurt? Right.
Dale Baumgartner 41:11
D
D
D
D
D
Dale Baumgartner 41:11
You know, I, I actually worked 48 years without an accident.
Jared Schmidt 41:16
Good for you.
Dale Baumgartner 41:16
And, and I, and I dealt with, I dealt with every piece of equipment the cheese, the cheese
department had, as far as from installing it, running it, and tearing it down,and whatnot. And I
actually never had a recorded accident in 48 years. So,I was actually proud of that. But, you
know, I'm one of these person, that I'm...you know, I've had been, I've been, I've been around
two fingers, that...Three! I've been there, I've been there for three fingers that had been cut off.
And, [Clears throat] you know, one of them was, or two of them, two of them was in the butter
operation. We had a machine that made one pound chunks of butter.
Jared Schmidt 41:34
Mkay.
Dale Baumgartner 41:34
And that machine took two fingers. And...
Jared Schmidt 41:34
Good for you. At the same time, or different people?
Dale Baumgartner 42:26
Different, two different, two different people. I got to run both of them to the hospital. [Jared
laughs] And then one was back in early '70s. And that guy was standing right beside me, and it
was an auger. And, you know, we were manually, we were manually filling the hoops back then.
The 40 pound hoops.
Jared Schmidt 42:52
Right. Right. With the curds and everything, right. Okay.
Dale Baumgartner 42:52
And you know, he's getting ready to just pass out and I just grabbed ahold of him, you know,
D
D
D
D
D
And you know, he's getting ready to just pass out and I just grabbed ahold of him, you know,
and started hollering. And then, Ed Yates was the cheesemaker, then, back then. And he was
still there, and he came running over and helped me and get him out there and got him out the
door. And Ed Yates ended up taking him to the hospital. But then I ended up taking Ed to the
hospital because he, [Starting to Laugh] he chopped his finger off in the butter machine.
[Laughs] And, you know, we just, you know, we didn't, like on Jim's finger, we really didn't know
much back then, you know, in early '70s about things like that. Yes, right. And we just needed,
you know, just, "Oh man, just need another half a pound." And he reached up, he was Jim
Galstrom, he was a cheese maker from Central Cheese Factory down here outside of
Cloverdale [Oregon]. And he reached up over top of the hopper.
Jared Schmidt 43:12
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 43:12
And the auger was right there, and he was gonna get just about a half-a-pound and all I heard
was a "Clunk!" I just heard it bind up, and check his fingers. [Laughs] Hell, his finger fell right
down into the hoop. I'm standing right there beside him...
Jared Schmidt 43:27
Right into the hoop?
Dale Baumgartner 43:28
Uh-huh. Oh, it fell right into the hoop. Anyway, I just, you know...He was he was going down.
Jared Schmidt 43:31
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 43:31
And I mean, this guy is, he was at least two of me.
Jared Schmidt 43:54
Mhm. Yeah. Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 44:09
D
D
D
D
Dale Baumgartner 44:09
And, you know, we didn't, we didn't ice his finger down or anything, you know.
Jared Schmidt 44:24
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 44:24
You know, hell, he just, you know, ended up with a stub. And then, but on Ed and Tim Kerrigan
we actually were smart enough to both of them. They never, they didn't, they didn't reattach
any of the three.
Jared Schmidt 44:40
Really?
Dale Baumgartner 44:40
Yeah. But we did, we did learn enough to where we got to ice them down, put a finger on it.
Jared Schmidt 44:45
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 44:46
And hopefully send it down there was a person. [Laughs]
Jared Schmidt 44:50
I'm just imagining seeing this finger just fall into a pile of, of curds.
Dale Baumgartner 44:54
Yeah. Yeah.
Jared Schmidt 44:54
Is that what happened? It just fell right into the...?
D
D
D
D
D
Dale Baumgartner 44:56
Oh, yeah. But, you know, I'm just terrible. I am terrible at other people bleeding.
Jared Schmidt 45:06
Okay.
Dale Baumgartner 45:06
I mean, for me to drive down the highway, here, and come across a big car wreck with three or
four people. I mean, I'm probably gonna be laying right beside them.
Jared Schmidt 45:16
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 45:17
I'm probably gonna get out, and run up there, and just fall right down there and just pass out.
Jared Schmidt 45:20
Which, given this is highway, is highly likely, anyways.
Dale Baumgartner 45:22
You know, I'm not, I'm not good at that. But, I...Myself, you know, if I'm bleeding, it doesn't
bother me at all. It doesn't bother me to gut an elk or whatever.
Jared Schmidt 45:37
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 45:37
But, you know, I've been at work before we're a guy had his arm hung up. He had his arm hung
up. He was hydraulic equipment, you know, back after the '90s, when we had the hydraulics, a
lot of hydraulics and stuff. And he's got his arm hung up in there. And I mean, it was right, it
was...The air pressure was trying to chop his arm off right there at the wrist.
D
D
D
D
D
Jared Schmidt 46:06
Oh, really?
Dale Baumgartner 46:07
And, you know, this guy is hung up here,now. He's just screaming at me. He is just screaming
at me to get him out of there, "Save my arm."
Jared Schmidt 46:18
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 46:20
And now you're dealing with an automated piece of equipment with this guy screaming at you.
And he's right there where you are, if not closer.
Jared Schmidt 46:27
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 46:27
And I'm at the control panel here, now.
Jared Schmidt 46:30
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 46:30
I've got to put to use machine in manual, and I've got to make sure that I don't [in a whisper]
screw up.
Jared Schmidt 46:36
Yeah...
D
D
D
D
Dale Baumgartner 46:37
I cannot mess up here, now, I've got to do this, right.
Jared Schmidt 46:40
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 46:40
It's tough when you, someone's screaming at you because it hurts so bad. And they want out of
there. And you know that, just too soon...you know, I mean, I got that guy out of there with his
arm still...And, and I mean, I got him out of there. And, you know, I mean, I was on the floor
within less than a minute. I was on the floor within less than a minute of getting out of, getting
him out of there.
Jared Schmidt 47:07
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 47:08
And I had another guy run him down to the hospital, you know. But, boy, I mean, to tell you, it
just took it right out of me. You know, we just, you know, I just hate, I just hate...I just hate
seeing anybody get hurt, you know.
Jared Schmidt 47:08
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 47:08
And most of the time, you know, they get hurt because they're, they're rushing, or they're in a
hurry. Or, you know, I mean, I...You know, I had a guy there that, you know, just kind of, kind of
playing macho, and, you know, just doing pull ups, you know.
Jared Schmidt 47:42
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 47:43
D
D
D
D
D
Dale Baumgartner 47:43
And there was a door jamb, you know, and he'd jump up on that door jamb and do pull-ups, you
know, just trying to impress us.
Jared Schmidt 47:52
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 47:53
Oh, his ring hung up, his ring hung. You know, back,back in, back in, oh, like the '60s all the
way to the, I'm gonna say up and probably till at least 2000, you know, people wore their
wedding ring at work. And then after, I'm gonna say right around 2000 or something that we,
we need to get rid of your jewelry and not wear a wedding ring or anything, you know, at work.
Because, you know, cheese gets under it. And, you know, it's just not good. It's just not good.
But, oh hell, just all but ripped his finger off.
Jared Schmidt 48:27
Yeah. Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 48:27
Anyway, just, you know, just just things like that, that, you know, those are things that are
going to happen. But, just most of them are just...You know, I've seen 'em where they were
running, you know, instead of walking, they're running too fast. And next thing you know,
they're on the ground, they got a broken arm, you know. Wet floors, you know, you're dealing
with wet floors all the time, in the cheese industry, wet floors, wet floors.
Jared Schmidt 48:27
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 48:27
You know, we had specific, we actually had specific boots that we wanted, we required them to
wear because of the slippery floors. His ring hung up up there. And, it wasn't good.
Jared Schmidt 48:38
Right, yeah.
D
D
D
Dale Baumgartner 48:48
Right. Yeah. I worked at an Olive Garden for three years and we had to have specific shoes.
Yeah.
Jared Schmidt 49:12
Because of the same slippery floors.
Dale Baumgartner 49:24
Right.
Jared Schmidt 49:24
with mopping and pasta.
Dale Baumgartner 49:25
Yeah, yep, yep, you bet.
Jared Schmidt 49:27
That makes sense. Man, seeing somebody lose their finger to a pile of cheese curds [Dale
laughs]. That's...that takes the cake. Ah! Well, congratulations on not getting hurt that's, I
mean.
Dale Baumgartner 49:38
Yeah, yeah.
Jared Schmidt 49:39
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 49:40
Yeah, 'cuz I dealt with all the big equipment, boy.
Jared Schmidt 49:42
D
D
D
D
D
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 49:43
Yeah.
Jared Schmidt 49:43
You mentioned it was super loud in the creamery. The creameries, all of them that you've
worked at. So, did that kind of reduce your ability, like, to talk to other people or chat across
when you're working, or how did that all play out?
Dale Baumgartner 49:58
You know, I do have terrible hearing loss. I do have some hearing aids, but I never wear them.
Jared Schmidt 50:05
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 50:09
You know, I always...I mean, there were some people that knew they were at work. But I always
got, I almost got the person I was talking to on my right side.
Jared Schmidt 50:21
Okay.
Dale Baumgartner 50:21
I would always make sure they were on my right side, because that's where my, I can hear with
my right ear.
Jared Schmidt 50:26
That's your good ear. Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 50:27
And I'll always try and get them...You know, there's nothing worse than driving down the road,
D
D
D
D
D
And I'll always try and get them...You know, there's nothing worse than driving down the road,
being a passenger, and they're on, their driving in there. That just, that's just almost a waste of
time to talk.
Jared Schmidt 50:39
Right, yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 50:40
And, you know, I mean, I get carsick. So most of the time I'm driving. So, that worked out.
Jared Schmidt 50:46
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 50:46
But,yeah, if you're on my left side, and you're shooting the breeze with me, I'm probably going
to be, I'm probably going to be picking out words and putting o things together, sentences
together.
Jared Schmidt 50:55
Mkay.
Dale Baumgartner 50:55
Yeah.
Jared Schmidt 50:56
So, so you had, the hearing loss is related directly to your work at the Creamery?
Dale Baumgartner 51:00
Oh, yeah, definitely.
Jared Schmidt 51:01
Mkay.
D
D
D
D
Dale Baumgartner 51:02
Yeah.
Jared Schmidt 51:02
So, when you were younger, then, like, did anybody like, was it a lot of telling stories while you
were working? Or everyone's just kind of doing their own thing, or?
Dale Baumgartner 51:14
Yeah, I don't know, though, there was much. You know, there wasn't a lot of...You were just at
work and you're, you know, you knew most every, you know, you knew everybody, or, or how
you knew, you knew everybody's family.
Jared Schmidt 51:34
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 51:35
You knew how many kids they had. You knew what their kids were doing. You knew [Laughs], I
think, I think when I was at work, you could probably could have asked me, "Was Joe Blow
here? Is he going on vacation next week?" I could have told you where he was going and what
he was going to do.
Jared Schmidt 51:51
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 51:52
I think I could have told you just about everybody here at Tillamook when they were going on
vacation, or whatever, I could have told you what they were going to do.
Jared Schmidt 51:59
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 52:01
D
D
D
D
D
Dale Baumgartner 52:01
I think we were very, very close. I, I'm not an office person.
Jared Schmidt 52:06
Yeah, you mentioned that.
Dale Baumgartner 52:07
And I was out on the floor. I'm sure the big boys in the front office will say too much. I think at
one time they would have said too much but I think, now they might say now we understand.
[Both laugh] But, I could, I could have told you where, what most people were going to do on
their days off or their, their vacations.
Jared Schmidt 52:33
Yeah, mkay.
Dale Baumgartner 52:33
Yeah.
Jared Schmidt 52:34
You just said, like, that you were all pretty much like a little community, right?
Dale Baumgartner 52:38
Mhm, mhm.
Jared Schmidt 52:38
What happens to that sense, I guess, what, what impact did having the creamery in Hebo close,
how did that shape the town, or dairy in general, in that community?
Dale Baumgartner 52:53
You know, with you know, you're only dealing with six people.
Jared Schmidt 52:56
D
D
D
D
D
Jared Schmidt 52:56
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 52:56
So, you know four them went on to working on, to the other plant, the other two moved on. You
know, it...I can't say as though it really changed Hebo a lot.
Jared Schmidt 53:10
Okay.
Dale Baumgartner 53:10
And we had, we actually, we had a grade-A side and we had a cheese side.
Jared Schmidt 53:10
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 53:10
You know, at one time, there.
Jared Schmidt 53:10
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 53:10
Yeah, yeah.
Jared Schmidt 53:10
Okay.
Dale Baumgartner 53:10
Yeah. Really, because, for the first, from 1969 to, I'm gonna say for the first couple of years
that we were up at the big plant in Tillamook, say all of '69, and probably all of '70, we might
even went into '71 a little bit. But it was a slow phasing into the grade-A roll.
D
D
D
D
D
Jared Schmidt 53:38
Okay.
Dale Baumgartner 53:38
There was still thousands of milk cans that came to the Tillamook Cheese Factory every day.
Thousands.
Jared Schmidt 53:46
Okay, yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 53:46
We're talking about hay truck.
Jared Schmidt 53:50
Okay.
Dale Baumgartner 53:50
We're talking about these hay trucks that are out here hauling hay.
Jared Schmidt 53:53
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 53:54
Only not with a trailer, but I mean, we're talking 20, 30 foot long trailers.
Jared Schmidt 54:00
Jeeze.
Dale Baumgartner 54:02
D
D
D
D
D
Dale Baumgartner 54:02
Milk cans two high.
Jared Schmidt 54:04
Right.
Dale Baumgartner 54:06
Showing up, I mean, I don't know how many was on there. But there was hundreds and
hundreds.
Jared Schmidt 54:09
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 54:10
And actually, we actually, so we actually, we actually took in a lot of milk cans for at least two
or three years yet after we moved up there along with grade-A milk, both.
Jared Schmidt 54:23
Okay. So, then, so every, all these little creameries closing down, in general, across the, [Loud
Thud as Jared Drops Pen] across the county...I dropped my pen, sorry.
Dale Baumgartner 54:45
Mhm, mhm.
Jared Schmidt 54:45
Like, did that really impact how the overall, like, dairy farming community was shaped or did
moing to the Creamery Tillamook make things easier for them?
Dale Baumgartner 54:57
No, I think at that point, you know, those farmers realized "I've either, I've either got to spend
some money and increase my herd size, or I need to get out."
Jared Schmidt 55:15
D
D
D
D
D
Jared Schmidt 55:15
Mkay.
Dale Baumgartner 55:15
It really came down to that.
Jared Schmidt 55:17
Mkay.
Dale Baumgartner 55:17
It came down to, because, you know, if you're going to, now you're going to put into bulk tank,
you know, maybe a 5,000 pound or 10,000 pound bulk tank and, you know, now your milk is
refrigerated like it should be. And you know, this guy is milking, this guy is milking 100 head of
cows and his bulk tank will just hold one day's worth of milk So his milk's gonna get picked up
every day.
Jared Schmidt 55:44
Mkay.
Dale Baumgartner 55:45
The other guy down the street, here, is only milking 50 cows, slowly building up his herd, his
milk's gonna get picked up every other day because he his bulk tank's big enough to where he
can hold two days worth of milk.
Jared Schmidt 55:58
Okay.
Dale Baumgartner 55:58
And so, you had, you had, you had the everyday pickups, and you had the every other day
pickups.
Jared Schmidt 56:05
Mkay.
D
D
D
D
Dale Baumgartner 56:05
And, you know, it was just a matter of, at that time, you know, that's where we're headed.
We're headed to grade-A, to grade-A milk, and there's not going to be any more milk cans
down the line and you need to step to the plate or get out, one or the other, really.
Jared Schmidt 56:21
Mkay. So, did you see a lot of dairy farmers in this county [ILL] close or shut down operations?
Dale Baumgartner 56:28
There wasn't very many...
Jared Schmidt 56:29
That closed?
Dale Baumgartner 56:30
I can't say as though there was very many that went out.
Jared Schmidt 56:32
Okay.
Dale Baumgartner 56:34
I don't think we started losing...I'm gonna say maybe the '90s. Maybe it was, I'm gonna say it's
probably fairly close to somewhere in the '90s when, when we were starting to lose a few
producers.
Jared Schmidt 56:56
Mkay.
Dale Baumgartner 56:57
And then we got into the 2000s. And I would say between, between 2000 and, say, 2015, I
wouldn't be surprised if we lost close to 50 producers.
D
D
D
D
D
Jared Schmidt 57:14
Mkay.
Dale Baumgartner 57:17
We probably lost 50 producers but all them cows stayed in the county.
Jared Schmidt 57:23
They all got bought out, or sold, or?
Dale Baumgartner 57:25
Right. They just, the cows just moved to another farm.
Jared Schmidt 57:28
Right.
Dale Baumgartner 57:28
Yeah, right.
Jared Schmidt 57:29
They joined another herd.
Dale Baumgartner 57:30
Yes. Right.
Jared Schmidt 57:31
Okay.
Dale Baumgartner 57:31
Yeah, yeah.
D
D
D
D
D
Yeah, yeah.
Jared Schmidt 57:32
Okay, that's interesting.
Dale Baumgartner 57:34
Mhm, yeah.
Jared Schmidt 57:35
What would you say is, right now, than, Dale is the largest, like, number of cows you see on a
farm and Tillamook County.
Dale Baumgartner 57:43
Oh [Laughs]. I know Hogan has several thousand [Laughs].
Jared Schmidt 57:51
Compare that to, what, you said, twenty-three was what you started...
Dale Baumgartner 57:53
Twenty-eight.
Jared Schmidt 57:53
Twenty-eight, yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 57:54
Yeah. You know, I mean, I think that's where, where it's at now is...In fact, one of the farms over
here in Sand Lake just sold out. And, you know, the guy bought them out, they're gonna, the
guy's gonna continue milking, but he wants to, this guy's goal is to have five farms, milking 800
cows in each farm. You know, so that's 4,000 cows, you know? Mhm. You know, I don't even
know if we have a farm in...And well, I mean, I know...There's probably no more...I'm gonna say
we're right...We've gone from, like, 300 and some producers or something back in, the, say the
'80s.
D
D
D
D
Jared Schmidt 58:47
Okay.
Dale Baumgartner 58:48
And we're under 100 now.
Jared Schmidt 58:51
Okay.
Dale Baumgartner 58:51
And, and I would have to say the Roy Pearn, or whatever, up to Nestuca [Oregon], here, kid
that actually worked for me actually, for a while there, went to farming. And he's probably only
got 60, 70 cows, maybe.
Jared Schmidt 59:10
Hmm.
Dale Baumgartner 59:10
I would have to say a farm that's got..There is hardly, I don't know if there's more than two or
three farms that are actually under a hundred cows now.
Jared Schmidt 59:26
Just two or three that are under a hundred?
Dale Baumgartner 59:27
Yeah.
Jared Schmidt 59:28
Really?
Dale Baumgartner 59:29
Oh, yeah. That'd be, that'd be the, I don't think there'd be more than that.
D
D
D
D
D
Oh, yeah. That'd be, that'd be the, I don't think there'd be more than that.
Jared Schmidt 59:34
Hmm.
Dale Baumgartner 59:35
They're all hundreds, hundreds, you know.
Jared Schmidt 59:37
Okay.
Dale Baumgartner 59:38
Yeah.
Jared Schmidt 59:39
That's interesting.
Dale Baumgartner 59:39
Hundreds all the way to thousands.
Jared Schmidt 59:41
Right.
Dale Baumgartner 59:42
Yeah.
Jared Schmidt 59:43
Huh.
Dale Baumgartner 59:44
D
D
D
D
D
Dale Baumgartner 59:44
Yeah.
Jared Schmidt 59:45
What a change you've seen, huh?
Dale Baumgartner 59:46
Oh, geeze. Ha! Absolutely.
Jared Schmidt 59:49
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 59:50
Oh, yeah. I've seen all the changes, you know. You know, these people, you know, like that
baby loaf, there [points to bench behind Jared with a demonstration ready to perform]. I got, I
actually have a baby loaf, ready to go there.
Jared Schmidt 1:00:01
On nice!
Dale Baumgartner 1:00:01
And, and, you know, there, there's, there just virtually isn't anybody up there that even...They
would, they would probably almost think I'm lying. [Laughs]
Jared Schmidt 1:00:15
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 1:00:16
You know, that every baby loaf was made that way, a five pounder was made in there, you
know, in an individual hoop and all that. I mean, those days are just, you know. It's just like the
car industry, you know, you build a car and you takes you a week to build one car back in the
day.
D
D
D
D
Jared Schmidt 1:00:34
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 1:00:34
And now we build thousands every day.
Jared Schmidt 1:00:37
Yeah, turn...
Dale Baumgartner 1:00:38
You know.
Jared Schmidt 1:00:38
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 1:00:39
It's just a [Laughs].
Jared Schmidt 1:00:40
A different world.
Dale Baumgartner 1:00:41
Yeah, yeah, right.
Jared Schmidt 1:00:43
Yeah, huh.
Dale Baumgartner 1:00:43
Yeah, yeah, I've seen all the changes. I've seen them all at the Creamery, that's for sure
[Laughs]
D
D
D
D
D
Jared Schmidt 1:00:49
Yeah, sounds like it. We talked about that a little bit the last time that's sounds...
Dale Baumgartner 1:00:52
All the way from washing the rags by hand.
Jared Schmidt 1:00:54
[Laughs] To equipment from New Zealand.
Dale Baumgartner 1:00:57
Hosing the floor down with buckets, you know? [Both laugh] Pretty amazing, actually.
Jared Schmidt 1:01:04
It is pretty amazing.
Dale Baumgartner 1:01:05
It is. It's been a heck of a career, that's for sure [Laughs].
Jared Schmidt 1:01:09
I was gonna switch things up a little bit, then. So, one of the things that I find so humorous and
makes me smile every time when I, when I drive into Tillamook, is that field that, I don't know
the farmer's name, but that alfalfa field where there's always a herd of elk.
Dale Baumgartner 1:01:24
Oh! [Laughs]
Jared Schmidt 1:01:24
Like, just right off the highway. And, as someone who grew up, you know, elk hunting, I'm
always like, this makes it look too easy. I was wondering, did you grow up with elk herds with
your cattle around, or?
D
D
D
D
Dale Baumgartner 1:01:37
You know, elk were introduced here, elk were actually, in, there really was, back in the, I'm
gonna say back in the '50s, there probably wasn't an elk around here.
Jared Schmidt 1:01:50
Back in the '50s, you said?
Dale Baumgartner 1:01:51
In the 50s, yeah. I'm gonna say it was...They reintroduced the elk here to the County back in
the, I'm gonna say it was, I'm gonna say was probably in the '60s.
Jared Schmidt 1:01:52
Really? Mkay.
Dale Baumgartner 1:02:11
Early '60s. And then, you know, once they got built up, they started hunting them, you know.
Jared Schmidt 1:02:17
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 1:02:19
But the elk law love these fields
Jared Schmidt 1:02:27
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 1:02:28
this time of year.
Jared Schmidt 1:02:30
D
D
D
D
D
Right.
Dale Baumgartner 1:02:30
This time of year, you know, like [ILL]'s there, the ones you're seeing there.
Jared Schmidt 1:02:34
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 1:02:36
And they're, and they, and they're out there, actually, maybe almost year round at [ILL]. But
most of the, most of them, most of them are going to move back up in the hills in the spring on
the green up.
Jared Schmidt 1:02:49
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 1:02:49
You know, within, within, I'm gonna say within the next, within the next month most of these
elk are going to move back up in the hills.
Jared Schmidt 1:02:57
Right.
Dale Baumgartner 1:02:58
They're gonna move out of the pastures. You know, during elk season, when the elk season
actually is, in November, the first part of November, really. The elk at that time, I would say the
vast majority of them are still up in the hills.
Jared Schmidt 1:03:17
Right.
Dale Baumgartner 1:03:18
D
D
D
D
D
Dale Baumgartner 1:03:18
And they're just slowly working back down towards the farm fields.
Jared Schmidt 1:03:21
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 1:03:22
Because it's easy pickings for this time of year, you know, in January, and February, and
whatnot.
Jared Schmidt 1:03:28
Right.
Dale Baumgartner 1:03:28
So it'd be really...You know, for me to go out and shoot one out in a farmer's field, it wouldn't
even, it's not gonna happen.
Jared Schmidt 1:03:35
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 1:03:36
It's not gonna happen.
Jared Schmidt 1:03:37
That's not sporting.
Dale Baumgartner 1:03:39
That's not...But, and yet, at the same time, these farmers are allotted, if you have more than
40 acres, then you can get a landowner preference tag.
Jared Schmidt 1:03:50
Mkay.
D
D
D
D
D
Dale Baumgartner 1:03:52
And, and you're allotted by how many acres you have, you can get so many tags, and you can
use them in the wintertime. And you can actually pop a cow out in the field in January or
whatever, you know.
Jared Schmidt 1:04:07
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 1:04:07
And, and...
Jared Schmidt 1:04:09
So they can get multiple tags?
Dale Baumgartner 1:04:10
Yes. So, so, this farmer, say he's got he's got five, he's got five tags.
Jared Schmidt 1:04:19
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 1:04:20
Can't kill bull.
Jared Schmidt 1:04:21
Can't kill a bull.
Dale Baumgartner 1:04:22
Cannot kill bull.
D
D
D
D
D
Jared Schmidt 1:04:23
Okay.
Dale Baumgartner 1:04:24
But the cows are, the elk are getting into your field.
Jared Schmidt 1:04:27
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 1:04:27
And you've got five cow tags. You can give them five cow tags, you can assign them, he could
give you one of those cow tags. He give me one of those cow tags, he can give your dad a cow
tag, or your mom a cow tag.
Jared Schmidt 1:04:41
Hmm.
Dale Baumgartner 1:04:41
And you could actually, within, I think, well, start in, say, I don't remember if it starts in
December, maybe the first of January. Might be the first of December.
Jared Schmidt 1:04:56
Mkay.
Dale Baumgartner 1:04:57
Between the first of December and, I believe, It's the end of March.
Jared Schmidt 1:05:01
Mkay.
Dale Baumgartner 1:05:02
It's either the end of March or the first of March.
D
D
D
D
D
It's either the end of March or the first of March.
Jared Schmidt 1:05:05
Mkay.
Dale Baumgartner 1:05:06
You can't kill them outside of that.
Jared Schmidt 1:05:08
Okay.
Dale Baumgartner 1:05:08
But if you, if one of them farmers gave you that tag, you could go down there and shoot a cow
out in his field, farm field.
Jared Schmidt 1:05:16
Really?
Dale Baumgartner 1:05:17
And it's more of a depredation hunt.
Jared Schmidt 1:05:22
Right.
Dale Baumgartner 1:05:23
It's what it really is.
Jared Schmidt 1:05:24
Yeah.
D
D
D
D
Dale Baumgartner 1:05:24
And it's just to try to keep the cows, keep the elk herd on their toes. "And, well, maybe I
shouldn't be out in this guy's field, he's not too good to us." [Both Laugh]
Jared Schmidt 1:05:36
"He doesn't like us very much."
Dale Baumgartner 1:05:37
Yeah.
Jared Schmidt 1:05:38
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 1:05:38
So that, and that goes on throughout the County in the wintertime.
Jared Schmidt 1:05:42
I did not know that.
Dale Baumgartner 1:05:43
But they're cows only, can kill only cows.
Jared Schmidt 1:05:45
Mkay.
Dale Baumgartner 1:05:45
Yes. Yes.
Jared Schmidt 1:05:46
Huh.
D
D
D
D
D
Dale Baumgartner 1:05:49
And some farmers don't, some farmers don't do it at all.
Jared Schmidt 1:05:52
Mkay.
Dale Baumgartner 1:05:53
You know, they don't participate at all. You know, let them eat it and
Jared Schmidt 1:05:57
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 1:05:57
that's fine, you know. Some some, do some don't.
Jared Schmidt 1:06:00
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 1:06:00
Yeah.
Jared Schmidt 1:06:01
Mkay. I do always enjoy seeing that herd of elk on the way in to the town. You think, you know,
you know what I'm talking about?
Dale Baumgartner 1:06:06
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. You bet.
Jared Schmidt 1:06:08
That cracks me up.
D
D
D
D
D
That cracks me up.
Dale Baumgartner 1:06:08
Yeah. So right out there with the cows.
Jared Schmidt 1:06:11
Yeah!
Dale Baumgartner 1:06:12
Yeah.
Jared Schmidt 1:06:12
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 1:06:13
Yeah. Yeah. It doesn't bother them at all.
Jared Schmidt 1:06:16
So you didn't grow up, necessarily, with the elk eating your cattle's feed?
Dale Baumgartner 1:06:19
Nope. No.
Jared Schmidt 1:06:20
They came into the play later?
Dale Baumgartner 1:06:22
Yes.
Jared Schmidt 1:06:23
D
D
D
D
D
Mkay.
Dale Baumgartner 1:06:23
Right.
Jared Schmidt 1:06:24
Okay.
Dale Baumgartner 1:06:24
And, you know, they didn't they, didn't, you know. The elk didn't used to come down into the
fields either, though. You know, the elk has continued to build, you know, more, and more, and
more. And as they got more, and more, and more, there was more, and more farm fields, you
know, getting attacked.
Jared Schmidt 1:06:42
Yeah, right.
Dale Baumgartner 1:06:43
You know, but you know, I mean, the last twenty years, they've actually hit the farm fields a lot,
tremendous, compared to what they did before.
Jared Schmidt 1:06:50
Okay.
Dale Baumgartner 1:06:51
Yeah.
Jared Schmidt 1:06:51
Okay. So then, when did you, because as I mentioned in the last interview, with the room we
are in, you have a handful of beautiful elk mounts [Dale laughs] is that, when did you start elk
hunting? When did you start...?
D
D
D
D
Dale Baumgartner 1:07:04
I killed, my killed my first elk in 1969.
Jared Schmidt 1:07:12
Mkay.
Dale Baumgartner 1:07:13
Killed my first elk in 1969. That was over in Eastern Oregon.
Jared Schmidt 1:07:16
Eastern Oregon, okay.
Dale Baumgartner 1:07:17
Yes. That was in Eastern Oregon. And, so, I've actually ended up killing a total, as of this fall,
the fall of 19, or 2020, 21.
Jared Schmidt 1:07:34
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 1:07:35
2021. I've actually from between 1969 and 2021, I've actually killed 70 bull elk.
Jared Schmidt 1:07:42
Wow.
Dale Baumgartner 1:07:42
I've killed a couple of cows, two or three cows, there, too. But, it's been years, and years, and
years since I've killed a cow.
Jared Schmidt 1:07:49
Mhm.
D
D
D
D
D
Dale Baumgartner 1:07:49
But, yeah.
Jared Schmidt 1:07:52
How do you always get the bull tags? My dad doesn't have that a good a luck [Laughs].
Dale Baumgartner 1:07:56
Well, you know, in 1977, I took a, I took a week vacation. I actually, I started hunting in Idaho. I
was hunting from 1969, in 1972, I started hunting Idaho, also, from 1972 to 1977, I hunted
Oregon and Idaho.
Jared Schmidt 1:08:26
Mkay.
Dale Baumgartner 1:08:27
So, I had an elk tag in Oregon, elk tag in Idaho.
Jared Schmidt 1:08:31
You could do that?
Dale Baumgartner 1:08:31
Yes.
Jared Schmidt 1:08:32
Really?
Dale Baumgartner 1:08:32
So, then, in 1977, I took a week vacation, I took it during the winter, during the winter, it was in
January, early-January. And I went to Jackson Hole [Wyoming]. Mhm. And I was, you know, I
back then I used to ski some. And I was skiing back there, and man I was just seeing these...At
D
D
D
D
D
that time, they figured there was, like, 9,000 elk on the refuge, there.
Jared Schmidt 1:08:56
Really?
Dale Baumgartner 1:08:57
The Jackson Hole Elk Refuge.
Jared Schmidt 1:08:59
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 1:08:59
Anyway, and I took a sleigh ride, they have the Clydesdale drawn sleigh, and you can actually,
you know, I don't remember what it was back then, a couple bucks, anyway. And they take you
out there, and when they go to feed the elk, you show up, get on the wagon. You go out there
and they throwing hay out. And I'm just seeing these hundreds of big bulls and I'm thinking
"Woa-ho! How did all these elk, bulls survived his hunting season?"
Jared Schmidt 1:09:28
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 1:09:29
And, you know, I just went right down to the Game Commission Office, there in Jackson Hole,
and talked to them, and, "Oh, yeah. You got to put in next year, you know, '78." So, 1978, from
1978 to, I think 1992,
Jared Schmidt 1:09:48
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 1:09:50
I was actually hunting in Oregon, Idaho, and Wyoming [Laughs].
D
D
D
D
Jared Schmidt 1:09:54
And you could legally hunt all three?
Dale Baumgartner 1:09:56
I could, I could legally kill three bulls every year.
Jared Schmidt 1:10:00
Okay. You just answered one of my dad's question, so.
Dale Baumgartner 1:10:02
Okay [Both laugh]. Anyway, that you know, in...I would say from 19--, I've got pictures, I've got
some hunting pictures, here, that are disgusting, actually.
Jared Schmidt 1:10:22
I grew up hunting, so, you know.
Dale Baumgartner 1:10:24
You know, here's the elk camp there. You know, back in, I'm gonna say, the first couple, two or
three years in Wyoming. We're actually hunting from 1978, to 1992, you could hunt deer and
elk all the same time.
Jared Schmidt 1:10:47
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 1:10:48
Same trip.
Jared Schmidt 1:10:49
Mkay.
Dale Baumgartner 1:10:51
The first couple years, it was only a couple of us went. And then, I've got a great big, I've got
D
D
D
D
D
The first couple years, it was only a couple of us went. And then, I've got a great big, I've got
four wall downs. But I, you had one big one back then, a 16 x 20 that we used.
Jared Schmidt 1:11:02
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 1:11:02
And then we got a 15 x...12 x 15 that would hook on to it for a cooked tent.
Jared Schmidt 1:11:08
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 1:11:08
It got to where there was six of us going every year, that was the maximum number of people
that could put in for as a party in Wyoming.
Jared Schmidt 1:11:16
Okay.
Dale Baumgartner 1:11:16
So, six of us were going every year.
Jared Schmidt 1:11:19
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 1:11:19
All six of us had a deer and elk tag. You're going over there for, say, like, ten days.
Jared Schmidt 1:11:24
Mhm.
D
D
D
D
Dale Baumgartner 1:11:25
I mean, there is meat to be packed every day. Every day. You know, when you got it, you know,
and you didn't kill anything but a four point buck.
Jared Schmidt 1:11:35
Right.
Dale Baumgartner 1:11:35
You know, and then bull elk. I mean, I've got pictures of, you know, ten heads in camp, you
know.
Jared Schmidt 1:11:45
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 1:11:46
You know, but, and, you know, my brother killed the moose. One of the other guys in the party
killed a moose, guy that drew a moose tag and killed the moose there.
Jared Schmidt 1:11:55
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 1:11:56
You know, I mean, it just goes on.
Jared Schmidt 1:12:01
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 1:12:01
And eventually, eventually, in the early '90s, one of the guys, one of the guys, there, that was
hunting with us...they ended up, they ended up changing the season. There was, they can see
the deer herd was starting to get, to be, a mule deer herd was starting to be affected by the
later deer hunt with the elk season.
D
D
D
D
D
Jared Schmidt 1:12:26
Right.
Dale Baumgartner 1:12:27
And so, they changed it. So they moved the deer season up ahead of elk season to try to limit
the number of nice bucks killed. And, and we went over, we had deer tags, so we went over in
September, and then turned around went back in October for the elk. And, one of them, one of
the guys that was with us came up with Giardia, he, we knew. You know, we're way up back in
the hills. And, you know, we've seen beavers, there, down below in the, in the creek and, you
know, we ended up drinking out of the creek anyway. And, I don't even know, I'm not even sure
back in the '90s, early-90s they even had, like, you know, the...
Jared Schmidt 1:13:12
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 1:13:13
What is it, a...life straw?
Jared Schmidt 1:13:18
Oh yeah, yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 1:13:19
You know.
Jared Schmidt 1:13:20
The life straw things, yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 1:13:21
You know, these things to take the bacteria out of the water, you know.
Jared Schmidt 1:13:24
Yeah.
D
D
D
D
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 1:13:25
And we were drinking out of the creek, and you know, the one guy came up, he went to the
doc, he came home, he didn't go back with us. But he had giardiah, they confirmed. Well, the
guy that was in the party, he also came up sick. So he went to his doctor and he told them,
"Hey, I got, you know, we're over hunting..." And so they start treating him for giardiah. Well, it
turned out it was actually cancer and he died, like, hell, he died like two months after hunting.
And, I'm gonna say less than two months after hunting season.
Jared Schmidt 1:13:53
Oh, I'm sorry about that.
Dale Baumgartner 1:13:55
You know, just a...And then, you know, he passed away. And then, one of the other guys was
like 58. And, you know, our camp is at 6,500, between 65 and 7,000 feet over there.
Jared Schmidt 1:14:09
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 1:14:10
And everything's up hill. There's nothing downhill from there.
Jared Schmidt 1:14:14
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 1:14:14
And, and the other guy was 58 at the time, and he says, "It's just becoming a young man's
game," he says, "I'm just, I'm out."
Jared Schmidt 1:14:22
Mhm.
D
D
D
D
Dale Baumgartner 1:14:22
And so, then it dropped back down to just two of us. And, again, you know, and...I've just, in
fact, actually, you know, me, I broke five vertebrae in my back in 1983.
Jared Schmidt 1:14:34
Hmm.
Dale Baumgartner 1:14:35
And the doctor I went to says, I was a runner before then and he said you're running days are
over. And he happened to be a bicycle rider and that's actually how I got into bicycle riding.
Jared Schmidt 1:14:50
Oh, okay.
Dale Baumgartner 1:14:51
And so I've been riding a bicycle ever since 1973, '83, 1983, I've been riding a bicycle.
Jared Schmidt 1:14:57
Mkay.
Dale Baumgartner 1:14:58
And, you know, I ride mountain bike, road bike. You know I ride, if it's a nice day, I'm gonna be
out on the bike.
Jared Schmidt 1:15:06
Nice.
Dale Baumgartner 1:15:06
I ride, I got, you know, we got to go onto in Sun River [Oregon], and, you know, I love it over
there. I go because I want to ride.
D
D
D
D
D
Jared Schmidt 1:15:15
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 1:15:16
And, you know, I've actually, there is no way I'd be hunting in Wyoming, still, right in here,
today, if I wasn't riding a bicycle and keeping in shape.
Jared Schmidt 1:15:25
Good for you.
Dale Baumgartner 1:15:26
It's just too, too rough a country, and the Selway-Bitteroot Wilderness in Idaho is roughter than
in Wyoming and you got to be in good shape or you might as well stay home.
Jared Schmidt 1:15:36
Yeah, yeah, yeah. My dad, he does, he exercises all the time to make sure he's ready for
Colorado.
Dale Baumgartner 1:15:41
Yeah, you bet.
Jared Schmidt 1:15:43
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 1:15:43
That's high altitude, too.
Jared Schmidt 1:15:44
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 1:15:45
D
D
D
D
D
Makes a big difference. You know, I'm going from virtually, I'm going from about 50 feet in
elevation [Laughs], you know, right over there, right over to 6,500 plus feet.
Jared Schmidt 1:15:56
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 1:15:56
Yeah.
Jared Schmidt 1:15:57
Now one thing that I was fascinated to learn when I first started talking with you, is, you held a
record for the largest Roosevelt elk at one point, right?
Dale Baumgartner 1:16:07
Right. It was open young with archery.
Jared Schmidt 1:16:09
Archery.
Dale Baumgartner 1:16:09
Yeah.
Jared Schmidt 1:16:10
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 1:16:10
Yeah, I held the world record. Yeah, yeah.
Jared Schmidt 1:16:12
And that was, where did you take that bull?
D
D
D
D
Dale Baumgartner 1:16:14
That was right, that was, I killed that bull within, I would have to say, no more than two miles
from the house from where I grew up.
Jared Schmidt 1:16:26
From, you took that bull near here? Near Hebo?
Dale Baumgartner 1:16:30
Hebo.
Jared Schmidt 1:16:31
No kidding?
Dale Baumgartner 1:16:32
Probably two miles, I killed it, I don't even know if it was two miles from where I grew up
[Laughs].
Jared Schmidt 1:16:37
How many points was that bull?
Dale Baumgartner 1:16:39
That's a 7 x 8.
Jared Schmidt 1:16:42
Wow. My, the one that I showed you ,that I shot, was nothing compared to that.
Dale Baumgartner 1:16:43
Yeah. [Laughs] No.
Jared Schmidt 1:16:50
D
D
D
D
D
I think yours could have eaten mine.
Dale Baumgartner 1:16:51
[Laughs] His little brother.
Jared Schmidt 1:16:55
His little, his little brothers little brother.
Dale Baumgartner 1:16:57
Yeah. Yeah.
Jared Schmidt 1:16:59
Yeah. And that, that elk is currently on, hanging, on display in the...
Dale Baumgartner 1:17:03
Beaver Grocery down here, yes.
Jared Schmidt 1:17:04
Beaver Grocery.
Dale Baumgartner 1:17:05
Yeah. Yeah.
Jared Schmidt 1:17:06
That's cool.
Dale Baumgartner 1:17:06
It's, I it's number three, now.
Jared Schmidt 1:17:09
D
D
D
D
D
Jared Schmidt 1:17:09
Number three.
Dale Baumgartner 1:17:10
Yeah.
Jared Schmidt 1:17:11
That's super cool.
Dale Baumgartner 1:17:12
Yeah. Yeah, it is cool. It's neat, you know. Yeah, hunting's just been my life. You know, didn't,
really, my when, when I grew up as a kid, you know, my dad...I'm gonna say we talked him into
going hunting, I'm gonna say I was probably, I'll bet I was the least 14. I had to be at least 14
when he killed his first deer.
Jared Schmidt 1:17:44
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 1:17:44
And, and we had to talk him into getting a tag. And, you know, he actually killed a deer. And
that was the only deer that I know he ever killed.
Jared Schmidt 1:17:51
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 1:17:51
And, you know, my brother hunted for a while with me, and going to Wyoming and Idaho and
whatnot. And he's dropped out. But just my one brother is the only one that ever really hunted.
Jared Schmidt 1:18:05
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 1:18:07
D
D
D
D
D
Dale Baumgartner 1:18:07
But I've, I've just lived,you know. I'm just I enjoy it. I think a lot of it is just getting away. You
know, like a Wyoming, there, where we go. Or even the Selway in Idaho.
Jared Schmidt 1:18:20
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 1:18:20
The Selway was 62 miles from the nearest town. There's no cell service or nothing.
Jared Schmidt 1:18:25
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 1:18:26
In Wyoming, we're 20, we're about 22 miles from town. And there's no cell service. So it's, I
think a lot of it is probably a break from work, too, you know, from stress and whatnot, you
know. Because I would have to definitely say that [With laughter] most of my career, or at
least, at least the last, at least the last 25, 30, I'd have to say probably almost the last 30 years
of my life were pretty, at the Creamery, there would have been, would have been considered,
probably, pretty high stress.
Jared Schmidt 1:19:07
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 1:19:08
And getting stressder and stressder [Both laugh]. Especially, you know, once you got to the
'90s, you're starting up a new plant. And then you get to 2000, and you're starting up another
plant, and then you get to 2005 or six and you're starting up another plant.
Jared Schmidt 1:19:22
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 1:19:22
And, in the meantime, you know, you got production in Idaho. You've got production up in
D
D
D
D
D
And, in the meantime, you know, you got production in Idaho. You've got production up in
Washington. You know, you just, you just, you've got so many. If you couldn't multitask, you'd
just be dead.
Jared Schmidt 1:19:39
Right.
Dale Baumgartner 1:19:40
You'd be, you'd be gone. You know, if you're not a really great if you don't have huge
mechanical skills, and huge multitasking, you'd just sink, you'd sink in a day.
Jared Schmidt 1:19:55
Hmm. Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 1:19:55
You'd sink in a heartbeat. Absolutely in a heartbeat. You know, you, you come home from work
at night, and it you, you know, you're just, you're just watching, you may be watching TV, but
the whole time you're thinking about what happened today and what's going to happen
tomorrow. In the cheese industry, you can't be [Pounds table three times] leaving the moment,
you have to be hours, you have to be thinking hours ahead of time or you are dead. 26 to 27
hours. And it was definitely very high stress, believe me. I like riding a bicycle and going
hunting into these places where there wasn't cell service was all just, more or less, just stress
relief things, you know.
Jared Schmidt 1:19:55
Yeah. Yeah, I can believe that.
Dale Baumgartner 1:19:55
Yeah, oh yeah. Definitely, definitely. You will not make it. You can't be leaving the moment
[Pounds table]. You have to be hours and days ahead, or you're not going to make it, you will
not make it at all. You have to be way out there ahead of time. You're home, you know, you're
watching the Super Bowl, you're off, but you know that there's going to be two or three calls
today, you're gonna you know, there's going to be a bunch of, you're going to be shorthand as
heck today.
Jared Schmidt 1:20:50
Yeah.
D
D
D
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 1:20:50
You know, and then we finally got it into union contract where, you know, if they call in sick on
a holiday, they didn't get any, they didn't get holiday pay.
Jared Schmidt 1:21:02
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 1:21:02
And that really helped. But, you know, the Super Bowl wasn't a holiday, but you knew there was
going to be call-ins. And, you know, the next thing, you know, you're going in and working while
that guy is watching the Super Bowl, and you're not watching it anymore [Laughs]. You know,
just things like that. It's just, that's where all the stress was, just worrying about if everybody's
gonna show up. You know, it's an around the clock operation. Our days were about 27 hours.
Jared Schmidt 1:21:29
Yeah. Makes sense to me.
Dale Baumgartner 1:21:45
You know, your, you can lose [Laughs]...Well, you could lose $50,000 in a half hour real easy
[Laughs]. Believe me.
Jared Schmidt 1:22:01
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 1:22:01
Yeah, it, you're, you're dealing, you're just dealing with huge dollars and cents.
Jared Schmidt 1:22:06
Mkay. Like, if the milk, something goes wrong with milk or someone doesn't show up. Or
equipment breaks down.
D
D
D
D
Dale Baumgartner 1:22:10
Oh yeah, yeah. Yeah. Equipment breaks down, you're just, you know, every minute's costing
you money at that point.
Jared Schmidt 1:22:18
Mkay.
Dale Baumgartner 1:22:18
Every minute, it's costing you money. Big money.
Jared Schmidt 1:22:21
Make sense. Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 1:22:22
Gotta get going. Gotta get going. You can't get to the plant quick enough. Or, you know, you
know, they're on the phone, and, you know, it's two o'clock in the morning and you're still fuzzy
and you're thinking, "Hey, give me a minute, will ya?" And, you know, they're, they're
a...They're expecting you to know, they're expecting an answer that's...that's going to help
them and, "Well, okay, we'll give that a try. But you're on your way?" And, "Oh, yeah. I'm on my
way."
Jared Schmidt 1:22:53
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 1:22:53
And, you know, they were expecting you to show up, and, "I'll be there in 20 minutes." [Laughs]
And I'll drive like hell because it's two in the morning.
Jared Schmidt 1:23:01
Right.
Dale Baumgartner 1:23:01
And, you know, that's just the way, that's just what life was.
D
D
D
D
D
Jared Schmidt 1:23:05
Yeah. Do you ever miss that?
Dale Baumgartner 1:23:09
Oh, I, you know, I don't miss, I don't miss the calls and the, and the stress in that. But I think
about the cheese factory probably almost every day.
Jared Schmidt 1:23:20
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 1:23:20
You know, I think about...You know, I think about the cheese making and all that, I think about
that all every day. Yeah. Pretty much. Yeah, it'll never go away I'm sure. You know, I love going
to the grocery store and seeing what they, you know, the Tillamook products that this store's
handling, or that store's handling, this one, here isn't handling much Tillamook products. But,
you know, I'm proud of what I did, there at the Creamery, you know.
Jared Schmidt 1:23:29
Mhm. Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 1:23:34
And proud of what they're doing today. You know? Yeah, just the way it is.
Jared Schmidt 1:23:51
What do you, what do you miss the most, now that you've retired?
Dale Baumgartner 1:24:01
[Laughs] You know, I think, I think the camaraderie, probably, is probably one of the things
that, you know. You know, you had to, it was all...I, you know, I didn't go to work all pissed off,
or, you know. I went to work with a good attitude every day, you know.
Jared Schmidt 1:24:20
D
D
D
D
Jared Schmidt 1:24:20
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 1:24:20
It may be a tough day, but, hey, we'll get by it, we'll get through it. And tomorrow will be
better, or whatever. And I think, you know, I enjoyed the crew. I enjoyed the guys, I enjoyed
everybody I was working with, you know. I think, you know, I mean, I miss the guys, you know.
And, you know, I mean, right after I retired, you know, we kind of ended up in this COVID thing.
So, you know, you can't go into the current plant. I grow, I have a huge dahlia garden out here.
Jared Schmidt 1:24:48
Hmm.
Dale Baumgartner 1:24:48
I got, probably, a hundred or more dahlia that I grow every year. And, you know, it's beautiful
out here, out in the field here in the summertime when the dahlias are blooming.
Jared Schmidt 1:25:01
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 1:25:01
And, you know, I mean, I take flowers into the secretary's office at work, still, you know, in the
summertime, you know. If I'm going to town here Monday, I'm going to I'll, I'll be taking a whole
great big bucket of dahlias into the girls, you know, all the gals, you know.
Jared Schmidt 1:25:16
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 1:25:16
They just, I just take them into Marlene, and then she just lets everybody, you know, take them.
But, you know, but I still do that. I even did that, I did that even through the COVID, you know.
Jared Schmidt 1:25:26
Mhm.
D
D
D
D
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 1:25:26
But I haven't been in to visit, you know, they don't want you in there visiting, you know. I don't
know when that's gonna let up again, you know, but, you know.
Jared Schmidt 1:25:37
The visitor center, you mean?
Dale Baumgartner 1:25:39
Well, no, no. As far as going in and socializing with the workers. You know, the crew, you know,
the guys that worked with, you know.
Jared Schmidt 1:25:46
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 1:25:46
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Jared Schmidt 1:25:48
Okay, makes sense.
Dale Baumgartner 1:25:48
That's kind of been a bummer, you know?
Jared Schmidt 1:25:50
Yeah. Yeah, no, I hear you on that one.
Dale Baumgartner 1:25:53
[Laughs] And I don't blame them. I don't blame them. You know, they don't even want
salesmen to show up there, you know.
D
D
D
D
D
Jared Schmidt 1:25:58
Yeah, yeah, or folklorists like me [Both laugh].
Dale Baumgartner 1:26:02
Just the way it is.
Jared Schmidt 1:26:03
Yeah, exactly. So I have one more question before we do our little demonstration. If the
Creamery gave you, said, "Dale, come back. You have free range to make whatever cheese you
want, unlimited budget." [Dale Laughs] What would you make? What's the, if you, like I said, a
free range, unlimited budget, you could do whatever you want. What kind of cheese would you
make?
Dale Baumgartner 1:26:26
Oh, it'd definitely be, it would definitely be aged cheddar.
Jared Schmidt 1:26:31
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 1:26:31
It would definitely be aged cheddar. You know, I think, I know, I don't...You know, I know you
love this 17-year-old cheese.
Jared Schmidt 1:26:40
It's hard not to love.
Dale Baumgartner 1:26:43
You know, there's not a lot of people here in the world that are, to have the opportunity to even
eat, and even have the opportunity to eat five-year-old, or ten-year-old, really top quality
cheddar cheese.
Jared Schmidt 1:27:01
D
D
D
D
Yeah, I count myself fortunate, so don't worry.
Dale Baumgartner 1:27:03
And, you know, I mean, this is, this is, you know, to be able to make and market cheese that'll
hold up for, you know, 15-20 years is...I mean, it's just a huge accomplishment, is what it is, it's
huge.
Jared Schmidt 1:27:20
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 1:27:20
And, you know, I mean, I would, it'd just be, you know, may cost a lot of major store it, you
know. But yeah, my focus would totally be on totally cheese aged, that's for sure.
Jared Schmidt 1:27:32
On an aged cheddar.
Dale Baumgartner 1:27:33
Aged cheddar.
Jared Schmidt 1:27:34
Why cheddar? Why not, like, a Swiss, or, why?
Dale Baumgartner 1:27:37
Oh. You know, I never...Well, your Swiss you're not gonna get into age or anything on that, you
know. It's...You know, the...to make a cheddar that will age out there to even five years and still
be good, not be bitter, or all that. Versus going out here and making a Swiss or something like
that.
Jared Schmidt 1:27:41
Or a Havarti or something.
D
D
D
D
Dale Baumgartner 1:28:10
That is going to be sold, you know, that is just high moisture. It's already high moisture, so
there's no way you can age it and have it turn out good.
Jared Schmidt 1:28:20
Okay.
Dale Baumgartner 1:28:20
Because it's moisture is too high.
Jared Schmidt 1:28:23
Mkay.
Dale Baumgartner 1:28:23
So, it's gonna take ten times more [Taps head] to make this than it is that.
Jared Schmidt 1:28:35
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 1:28:39
[Laughs]
Jared Schmidt 1:28:39
More brainpower than the, to make the aged cheddar.
Dale Baumgartner 1:28:42
Yeah, yeah.
Jared Schmidt 1:28:43
Is that why crumbles, then, too, is the, the moisture is gone?
D
D
D
D
D
Dale Baumgartner 1:28:47
Right, right.
Jared Schmidt 1:28:47
Ooh.
Dale Baumgartner 1:28:48
Yeah, you can't, you can't, you can't slice that for nothing.
Jared Schmidt 1:28:52
Yeah, I can see that [Jared].
Dale Baumgartner 1:28:53
Yeah. There's no such thing as slicing it.
Jared Schmidt 1:28:56
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 1:28:57
Once you, once you gets to...You know, you could take a baby loaf, actually. You could take a
two pound baby loaf and stick it in the freezer. And that was, anytime you freeze cheese, it
stops aging process period. No more aging, it's done.
Jared Schmidt 1:29:11
Mkay.
Dale Baumgartner 1:29:12
And once you thaw it out, it's just going to fall apart like this.
Jared Schmidt 1:29:15
D
D
D
D
D
Jared Schmidt 1:29:15
Really?
Dale Baumgartner 1:29:16
Even if it was six-months-old. Yeah.
Jared Schmidt 1:29:19
Even if it was the standard, like, 60 day cheddar. Hmm, yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 1:29:20
Yeah, yeah. It's not going to age anymore, and it would actually, the moisture would freeze,and
it would actually crumble when you cut it up. But this here, this here...You know, this here, you
know the, you know, the temperature that you age this plays a big role, too. That you age this
cheese at, to get it out to 10 or 15 years old. The temperature, the age it plays a big role. I
mean, you know the moisture, the fat and protein. There's, it's not...It takes a lot.
Jared Schmidt 1:29:56
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 1:29:57
It's not, it just doesn't happen by [Snaps Fingers]...
Jared Schmidt 1:30:00
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 1:30:01
...flip of a finger, it actually, it doesn't happen by accident [Laughs].
Jared Schmidt 1:30:07
Yeah, like I've been saying, it's so interesting how much more complicated and rich making
cheese is than I think most people have this conception of it. Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 1:30:16
D
D
D
D
D
Dale Baumgartner 1:30:16
Oh, most people would be shocked. They would be shocked. Totally shocked. Absolutely. Yeah,
they'd be shocked.
Jared Schmidt 1:30:24
It's not just nacho cheese whiz. [Dale laughs]. Alright, I need to know. How do you feel about
Cheez Whiz and all those kinds of things? Like nacho, melted nacho cheese at baseball games?
Dale Baumgartner 1:30:34
Oh [Laughs]. You know, I love nachos. But, you know, for me, you know that...You know, Kraft,
or whatever you want to call it, commodity cheese.
Jared Schmidt 1:30:54
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 1:30:55
Commodity cheese is just commodity.
Jared Schmidt 1:30:58
Mkay.
Dale Baumgartner 1:30:58
It's commodity you know, it isn't. You know, there's no, there's no comparison, in my book.
Jared Schmidt 1:31:05
Yeah, there's no artistry.
Dale Baumgartner 1:31:06
This commodity piece of cheese here that made, just mass produced.
Jared Schmidt 1:31:11
Mhm.
D
D
D
D
D
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 1:31:12
And sold, versus this here, they're, they're just two different products. You know, it's kind of
horse and buggy versus Ford Model T, you know. [Laughs]
Jared Schmidt 1:31:25
Yeah. One of these things is not like the other.
Dale Baumgartner 1:31:29
Yeah, you know. One is just mass produced
Jared Schmidt 1:31:33
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 1:31:33
at the lowest possible price we can produce it at. And this one here is produced at the most
consistent...as a very, you know, consistent product.
Jared Schmidt 1:31:47
Mhm.
Dale Baumgartner 1:31:48
And very controlled. You know, the fat, the protein, the ratio, the temperature it's stored at
[Claps hands]. All that is totally 100% controlled here. Were over here [Pounds table] is just,
you know, get it out the door.
Jared Schmidt 1:32:07
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 1:32:07
Because tomorrow. This cheese is heat shocked. It isn't fully pasteurized. There's bacteria in
that milk, we know there's bacteria in that milk, that helps us produce Tillamook cheddar flavor.
D
D
D
D
D
that milk, we know there's bacteria in that milk, that helps us produce Tillamook cheddar flavor.
Jared Schmidt 1:32:21
Mkay.
Dale Baumgartner 1:32:21
[Pounding table for emphasis] This over here is milk that comes in, gets kicked into that vat, is
fully pasteurized, all the bacteria is killed off, and is on...I would say on commodity cheese
production, most of that cheese is probably on a truck heading somewhere to a plant to be cut
into slices or whatever within, I'm gonna say, within less than eight days. I'm gonna say five to
six days. All they're waiting for is the, the analytics, the salt, the fat, the moisture, numbers to
come out. They meet the criteria and they're on a truck and gone. This cheese here, we're not
going to do anything with this cheese for at least 60 days.
Jared Schmidt 1:33:08
Yeah.
Dale Baumgartner 1:33:08
It's going to set for at least 60 days. And then we're going to taste, we're going to sample it,
and all that. I mean, there's just completely two different products.
Jared Schmidt 1:33:19
And it might go back in to store for even longer.
Dale Baumgartner 1:33:22
That's right.
Jared Schmidt 1:33:23
As opposed to its cousin on the...
Dale Baumgartner 1:33:25
Could be for seventeen, twenty years [Laughs].
D
D
D
D
Jared Schmidt 1:33:28
That's so cool.
Dale Baumgartner 1:33:29
Yeah.
Jared Schmidt 1:33:30
That's great. Well, thank you, Dale. I'll stop the recorder here unless you have anything else
you'd like to add, or?
Dale Baumgartner 1:33:34
Yeah, yeah. No, I'm...
Jared Schmidt 1:33:36
All righty, hit stop...
D
D
