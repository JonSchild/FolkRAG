LI i 
Written by HARRY BENNETT, and sung with great success by Tannic-
W OODSON, at the Holiday-street Theatre, Baltimore. 
THERE'S a 
fellow who hangs around bar-rooms. 
You've heard of him I 
have no doubt. 
He hasn't got much of a 
wardrobe, 
And his gaiters are all busted out. 
He's too proud to live in a 
hotel, 
This high-toned and elegant cove, 
And you'll find him a 
talented drinker, 
This bum that sits back of the stove. 
CHORUS. 
You bet he's the champion free-luncher. 
He's a 
muncher! yes, a 
cruncher! 
You bet he's the champion free-luncher, 
This bum that sits back of the stove. 
He'll tell you his parents are wealthy, 
But he was cut off with a 
dime. 
He can make a 
big hit on the crackers, 
And take seven encores each time. 
His nose is the color of crimson ; 
His eyes in his head seem to rove; 
He can take a 
whole pint at a 
swallow, 
This bum that sits back of the stove. 
You bet he's, etc. 
He doesn't care much for the fashions, 
And soap it's a 
stranger to him. 
He imagines that he looks quite dashing 
When he's full of whiskey and gin. 
He'll brace the best house in the country, 
And all round the city he'll rove. 
The boys call him " Jimmy the Lusher," 
This bum that sits back of the stove. 
You bet he's, etc. 
Cold water he hates worse that poison. 
It's taste he forgot long ago; 
But give him the worst kind of whiskey, 
And the white of his eyes he will show. 
He rents the first floor in a 
coal-box, 
And there every night he will rove. 
He eats snow-ball dumplings for breakfast, 
This bum that sits back of the stove. 
You bet he's, etc. 
CHARLEY OVERSHOES. 
Written by HARRY BENNETT, and sung with great success by HARRY 
WoonsoN, at the Howard Athenmurn, Boston. 
His name is Charley Overshoes; 
Some people call him Jakey. 
At night if he drinks too much booze 
In the morning he is shaky. 
His hair is like a 
door-mat; 
One eye is always black; 
He looks just like a 
camel, 
With a 
hump upon his back. 
CHORUS. 
Ta in, ta ta, my boozy dear, 
I'll play a 
game of cards, 
And stick you for the beer. 
He'd strike you with a 
cabbage 
If the game he'd lose. 
The man that loves free lunches 
Is Charley Overshoes. 
His necktie is a 
piece of cord, 
This terrible old snoozer. 
He never pays a 
cent of board; 
Free lunch is what he'd chew, sir. 
His shoes are injun-rubber. 
He'll never stand a 
treat. 
He's the most outrageous grubber 
That ever I 
did meet. 
CHARLEY OVERSHOES.—Concluded. 
CHORUS. 
Tra-la-le, tra-la-le I 
You'll hear him squeal, 
4  
g I must brace the bar again, 
And get another meal." 
The restaurant and liquor stores 
Know him by his face. 
There's not a 
store in all the town 
But what he's tried to brace. 
He never combs his hair at all, 
And. never wears a 
collar. 
If he thought he could get & meal 
He'd strike you for a 
dollar. 
His father takes in washing; 
His mother drives a 
ear; 
But Charley he does nothing 
But loaf around the bar. 
CHORUS. 
So long, so long, 
And tra-la-la-lu 1 
I 
must behind the stove, 
Or my nose it will get blue. 
If I 
could get a 
bracer; 
I'm dying for a 
booze. 
The champion free-luncher 
Is Charley Overshoes_

THE HUNGRY MAN FROM HARLEM 
Sung with immense success by JAMES 
OF 
a 
hungry man I'm going to sing, 
And tears to your eyes it will surely bring, 
He could swallow almost anything, 
This hungry man from Harlem. 
He'd eat a 
hundred times a 
day 
And for his board he could not pay, 
He could get outside of a 
bale of hay, 
This hungry man from Harlem 
CHORUS. 
The way he'd eat it couldn't be beat 
All kinds of meat both sour and sweet, 
He'd eat everything they had in the place, 
And bite a 
big chunk from his mother-in-law's face. 
He chewed up his father, devoured his mother. 
He swallowed his sister and tackled his brother, 
He swallowed the clock, bit a 
hole in the door. 
Chewed a 
hole in the roof and swallowed the floor, 
He chewed up his shoes and chewed up his hat, 
Made a 
raid on the kitchen and swallowed the cat. 
He chewed umbrellas and eat seven stoves, 
And bit off one-half of the servant girl's nose. 
And that's the way he used to eat, 
This hungry man from Harlem. 
(I) 
rr, 
THE HUNGRY MAN FROM HARLEM.—Con-
eluded. 
He eat so much it made him thin, 
His hair fell out and his cheeks fell in, 
His bones were sticking thro' his skin, 
This hungry man from Harlem. 
He struck this city one fine day 
And for a 
meal he could not pay, 
He took a 
walk along Broadway, 
This hungry man from Harlem. 
The way he'd eat, etc. 
The very first thing he chanced to meet 
'Twas a 
German Band coining down the street, 
He swallowed them all, as fast as they come, 
He chewed up the music and eat the base-drum. 
He tackled a 
crowd coming home from a 
ball, 
They began for to dance and he swallowed them all. 
He went down to the ferry and swallowed a 
boat, 
He went out on election and chewed up his vote. 
At last he came into Brooklyn town, 
He met a 
big preacher, and gobbled him down -; 
He swallowed a 
pump, put his teeth thro' the handle, 
And eat the reports of the Brooklyn scandal. 
Then, gaffing disgusted with grub so light, 
He swallowed himself clean out of sight, 
And that's the way he used to eat, 
This hungry man from Harlem. 
The ways he'd eat, etc.

way, New York. 
Price 40 cents. 
You will miss me, darling Chloe, when I 
sleep beneath the 
sod, 
Where the summer winds are murm'ring o'er the Tea ; 
You will think of me in kindness, as life's weary road you 
plod, 
When my spirit rests from pain and sorrow free ; 
The sands of life tire slowly ebbing, darling, with the tide, 
And soon these bones will mingle with the clay ; 
In the winter of your sorrow you will think of how I 
died, 
And you'll miss me, Chloe, when I'm laid away. 
cnonu:_-1 
For old uncle Tom is feeble,. 
And his head is bending low ; 
Master calls, he can no longer stay--
For his limbs are getting weary 
And his eyes are growing dim, 
But you'll miss me, Chloe, when I'm Laid away I 
You will tell our little children that their father dwells 
above; 
How the angels led him up the golden stair, 
You will tell them how I 
lov'd them, with a 
fond and 
sacred love ; 
They must try to meet their poor old father there.' 
And when the Judge his trumpet sounds from realms of 
bliss on high, 
And the morning of the great day comes at last, 
I 
will meet you, darling, Chloe, and together you and I, 
Will no longer dread December's wintry blast. 
For old uncle Toni, etc.

HARDING. 
THE red, red rose that lovely grows, 
And blushes like a 
maiden, 
Keeps nodding to the gentle breeze, 
With rosy perfume laden; 
To greet a 
little tiny elf, 
For her my heart is yearning; 
And lately I 
am scarce myself, 
My heart with love is blooming. 
CHORUS. 
Little Cherry Blossom, will you love me ? 
Little Cherry Blossom, will you wed me ? 
While the stars are twinkling in the silent dell 
Such a 
tale of love I'll tell thee ! 
Oh! little Cherry Blossom, will you love me ? 
Little Cherry Blossom, will you wed me ? 
While the stars are twinkling in the silent dell 
Such a 
tale of love I'll tell thee! 
The lily all proclaim so fair, 
She is the queen of flowers ; 
The rose, they say, conveys true love, 
'Mid Cupid's shining bowers ; 
The Pansie says, " forget me not ! " 
The Laurel crowns with glory, 
The one that's fairer than the lot, 
The subject of my story, 
Little Cherry Blossom, etc. 
The dew upon the rose is like 
The tears that she is shedding, 
Impatient for a 
day to come, 
For soon there'll be a 
wedding; 
And from life's garden I 
shall cull 
A 
fair and fragrant flower, 
And keep it blooming all my life, 
Within love's happy bower. 
Little Cherry Blossom, etc.

A GIRL AND A BOY. 
Written by ALICE BATEMAN and BILLY Nomisx. 
WE are out here before you, a 
girl and a 
boy; 
We're just from old Ireland, the town of Athloy. 
Wherever we go ourselves we enjoy, 
So watch the manceuvres of the girl and the boy. 
We'll show you some pictures not taken from Rome, 
But just as it's done in our own native home. 
The first will be Kathleen and Terence farewell; 
Oh, it was a 
sad parting, the truth for to tell! 
SHE.—And I 
will be Kathleen. 
HE.—And I 
Terence Arooh. 
BOTH. — And we'll show the kind people the parting 
so true. 
(lie sings verse of song.) 
The next will be Emmett, the hero of all; 
In the cause of his country he nobly did fall. 
We will show you his parting from his Mary so dear. 
Oh, poor Mary Curran, for you we shed tears. 
HE.—Now, I 
will be Emmett. 
SHE.—And I 
Mary Curran. 
BOTH.—For the loss of poor Emmett the people did 
mourn. 
The next will be Paddy at Donnybrook fair, 
And his own darling Kathleen is sure to be there. 
For the cares of the world we don't care a 
fig, 
So we'll drown all our sorrows in a 
neat Irish jig. 
(Jig and dance off) 
Arrah, Kathleen, you are now going to leave me 
All alone by myself in this place; 
But I 
know that you'll never deceive me, 
No, no, while there's truth in your face; 
For England's a 
beautiful country— 
Such elegant boys—ah, but then, 
You'll not be forgetting your Terence, 
But come back to old Ireland again.

poor old slave, 
I 
told you that I 
had a 
heap of pleasure. 
Now everything am silent as the grave, 
All the boys that belowg to good old 'missal

Oh, what will become of Uncle Pete ?

No more will I 
see my good old missy, 
Dey laid her slowly in de clay ; 
She sickened and she withered like a 
flower, 
Yes, from dis weary world she's passe4 away,

JUST BEHIND THE SCENES. 
As sung by Gus W ILLIAMS. 
"Words and Music by FRED ALBERT. 
The Music of this Song is published by E. H. H ARDING, 223 Bowery, New 
York. 
Price 10 cents. 
W HEN but a 
little boy, oh, it really was my joy, 
To visit the Theatre I'll admit. 
How happy I 
could be, the performances to see, 
While seated in the gallery or pit. 
I 
fancied all was real that the curtain did reveal, 
But since that I 
have pass'd beyond my teens, 
I 
begin to understand, tho' in front it may look grand, 
'Tis very diffrent just " Behind the Scenes." 
So if you will attend for a 
moment now, my friends, 
I'll do the best within my humble means, 
To show to you to-night, tho' in front it may look bright, 
'Tis very diff'rent just " Behind the Scenes." 
The comedian is one who while causing lots of fun. 
His heart may yet hang heavy in his breast, 
And the man who plays the king, tho' it seems a 
curious 
thing, 
In private may be very poorly drest. 
The Ladies too—so fair, who go floating through the air, 
And look like little angels there instead, 
Sometimes have to roam unto a 
wretched home, 
And oftentimes go supperless to bed ; 
While those who play the parts of the men with stony 
hearts, 
And look as if their tempers were like fiends, 
Could you see them while away, you'd very likely say, 
They're the mildest looking men " Behind the Scenes." 
'Tis just the same in life, for what lots of care and strife, 
And suftering some folks will undergo, 
Just to 3ut a 
shine, and to make themselves look fine, 
And think of nothing else but outside show;

A 
JUST BEHIND THE SCENES.—Concluded. 
They fancy and sppose that those who wear good clothes 
Always look the richest and the best; 
But an honest heart and mind is respected most you'll find, 
No matter whether poor or richly drest. 
Still many one you know have caused themselves much 
woe, 
Through trying hard to live beyond their means, 
And though they wear a 
smile, yet really all the while 
They are very wretched just " Behind the Scenes." 
There's many a 
married pair, I've no doubt you are aware, 
Who in public are so tender and so kind, 
But could you only see them at home in privacy, 
A 
very different state of things you'd find. 
Sometimes it is the wife who's the cause of all the strife ; 
Sometimes it is the husband who's to blame, 
Let that be how it may who causes all the fray, 
Their quarrelling continues just the same. 
Yet still they try to hide, from all the world outside, 
The snarls and jars with which their household teems, 
And often when you hear them call each other dear, 
They hate each other just " Behind the Scenes." 
The wealthy and the great, who can ride about in state, 
And have a 
host of wealth at their command, 
Have, you may be sure, as many troubles to endure 
As those who are the humblest in the land ! 
For England's greatest sage says all the world's a 
stage, 
And each of us endeavor all our might, 
Our follies to conceal, and only to reveal 
That which is most pleasing to the sight. 
No matter where you go, from the highest to the low, 
From peasantry right up to kings and queens, 
Whatever they enjoy there's something to annoy, 
If we could only see " Behind the Scenes."

I'se gwine back to Dixie,

GOOD OLD SOUTHERN H0111...E. 
Sung by AL. PAGE. 
Not many years ago, 
When I 
use to rake and hoe 
On the Louisiana bottom, all the day ; 
But since I've been set free, 
Not much pleasure do I 
see ; 
But at last those good old days have passed away. 
But I 
am getting old and gray, 
And I 
soon must pass away. 
My good old massa beckons me to come. 
If you hear those voices ringing 
I'm waiting for you now, so I 
must go leave my good old 
southern home. 
CHORUS. 
All my friends have gone up there, 
With the angels bright and fair ; 
My good old mosso, beckons me to come 
From the heaven bright and fair, 
With angels dwelling there, 
I 
must go and leave my good old southern 1..e.tnie. 
When I 
was but a 
little boy, 
To dance and sing it was my joy; 
You could always find me gamboling on the 
But I'm getting old and gray, 
And I 
soon must pass away, 
And say farewell to the happy days I've seen , 
But I 
know I 
soon must go, 
For the Bible tells me so— 
I'm waiting for my summons now to come; 
For de angels dwell up dar, and look so bright and fair, 
I 
must go and leave my good old southern home.

Dress LI

[Sc,ene, a room. 
PETE, JAKE, JOE and JIM discovered. 
Banjo hanging on the wall.] 
PETE.—Joe, can't you take down the old Cremona ones 
more, and let's have one more dance before we go? Just to 
get your hand in. 
JOE.—Don't care if I 
do. 
Anything to keep up the racket, 
(Takes down banjo.] Now, boys, give us the heel-taps. [Plays 
4rnd JAKE, PETE and JIM dance.] 
PETE.—Play that tune Uncle Billy used to freeze to. [Jou 
plays the air, " Oh, Poor Old Man," at first pretty briddy, gra-
dually more and more slowly and faintly.] 
JIM.— That makes a 
feller's eyes water. 
How I 
wish old 
Uncle Bill was here. 
He used to love to be with the boys. 
JOE. 
Uncle Bill ? 
Why, he must be done gone long ago. 
L 
think I 
see him now. How he could sing, too. 
He went 
away five years ago last Christmas eve. 
Just five years ago 
to-night. 
JAKE.—Why, he taught me the first step I 
ever knew. 
PETE.—Yes, and me too. 
They couldn't beat him much on 
4aeel and toe-ology. 
Could they, Jokey? 
JAKE.—Not much. 
PETE.—Then he was so good-natured. 
JOE.— What tricks we used to play on the old man. 
JAKE. — Yes ; do you remember when we filled an old hat 
with bricks, and turned it upside down on the ground before 
Uncle Billy's door ? 
He made a 
kick at it, and then you ought 
to have heard him squeal. 
Ha! ha! 
ALL.—Ha! ha! 
JIM.— But he was so good-natured. 
JOE.—Then do you remember how well we fooled him with 
the dinner horn ? 
PETE.—Yes; when we filled it up with mud. 
JOE.— Ha! ha! Who ever saw such a 
face when he got 
through blowing! 
JAKE.—'Twas a 
shame to worry the old man. 
I'd like to 
see him once more.

rel. 
PETE.—Wouldn't it be a 
joke if he was to walk into this 
room, of all the nights in the year, this very Christmas eve? 
JI3L—Don't; you make me shudder. 
JOE.—Oh, you can't scare Inc. 
I 
aint afraid of ghosts; are 
you, Jake ? 
JAKE.—No; wouldn't run for an army of 'em. 
ALL.—Guess not. 
JAKE.—Anyhow, not from such a 
good-natured ghost as 
Uncle Billy. 
Why, he wouldn't hurt a 
fly. 
[Knock heard 
4Putside.] 
ALL (
startled).—Who that ? [Knock repeated.] 
JIM — Who—who—who's that knocking at the kitchen 
door ? 
JOE.—I 
aint a 
bit frightened; but I'm gone down the street, 
Good bye, boys. 
[Exit JoE.] 
ALL.—Oh, he's a 
coward. [Knock outside.] 
JIM.—I'M a 
good mind to follow Joe. I 
hate to let him go 
alone. 
Not that I'm a 
bit scared. 
Oh, no! 
PETE.—That must be Uncle Billy's ghost! I—I—I 
think 
leave you, Jake, to keep him company. 
JAKE.—Not if I 
know myself. 
No ghosts for me. 
Let's go 
together. [Exit PETE and JAKE.] 
[Air of "Poor Old Man" played plaintively as UNCLE BILL 
enters.] 
UNCLE BILL (
looking round).—Nobody home? I 
thought 
I 
heard voices. 
Can it be possible that these old ears of mine 
have deceived me? I've been away from home just five years 
this very Christmas eve. 
Ah, that's a 
long time to wander up 
and down the world. 
Maybe the folks are all dead. 
Shouldn't 
wonder. 
Most time for the old man to turn up his toes to the 
roots of the daisies. 
I 
suppose I'm forgotten. 
[Lays down his 
valise.] 
Everything looks so natural. 
[Sees banjo.] 
Ali, they 
/tint all dead here! 
[
Plays.] 
My old fingers haven't forgot-
ten their old game yet. 
[Enter PETE, JAKE, JIM and JOE, each shoving and hiding 
behind the other.] 
PETE.— That's Uncle Billy or his ghost. 
JAKE.—Ghosts don't play banjos, do they?

OH ! POOR OLD MAN.H.CONTINURD.1 
JIM.— Never heard one before. 
Did you? 
JOE.—Never. 
Sartin sure. 
UNCLE BILL.—Why, there's the boys! 
Don't ye know you/ 
old friend, Uncle Billy ? 
ALL.— Uncle Billy! 
Alive and well! 
UNCLE BILL.—Never felt better in my life, barrin' a 
little 
rumatiz. 
[All shake hands with UNCLE BILL.] 
JAKE.—W hy, we took you for a 
ghost. 
Jim.—How d'ye do, Uncle Billy ? 
JOE.—Why, you came very nigh scaring us. 
PETE.—Old man, how do you find yourself? 
Where have 
you been ? 
UNCLE BILLY.—Oh, I've wandered up and down a 
heap 
since I 
saw you. 
But I'm as good and as fine as a 
cotton hat, 
if I 
am broke. 
How's all the boys and gals? 
JAKE.— Oh, they're all alive and kicking. 
UNCLE BILLY.—Well, boys. won't you dance and play for 
the old man, just for old times' sake. 
ALL.—Give us a 
song yourself, Uncle Billy. 
JOE.—Sing to us about yourself. 
JIM.— Yes, we all like to hear you. 
UNCLE BILLY.—Well, boys, just one of you give me the 
air on the old music-box, and help the old man along in the 
chorus.

Cos I 
couldn't learn they said I 
was a 
fool. 
Oh I 
poor old man! 
My skin was white, and I 
was fair before they took to teaching me 
I 
always cried, and never tried to learn my alphabet ; 
I 
used to drink the ink, I 
think, as they were always beating mo, 
'Twas through my skin the ink worked in, and made me blaeli

Oh I 
b'lieve me, &c. 
I 
had many sweethearts when I 
was young and strong. 
And we say so, and we hope so. 
But now all the girls laugh and say go along. 
Oh! poor old man! 
I 
once did love a 
pretty girl, and promised I 
would marry her, 
I 
bought the ring, and everything was ready for the day; 
And when the day arrived I 
called, and hope to church I'd carry 
her, 
She'd slop'd, elop'd, gone, done, and run with another man aw 
Oh I 
b'lieve me, &c. 
If I 
had the cash I 
would treat you all round. 
And we say so, and we hope so. 
But in my pockets not a 
penny to be found. 
Oh I 
poor old man ! 
But listen while I 
tell you what my little brother Jimmy did, 
He borrowed all my money for to speculate, you know ; 
He put it in a 
bank whose liabilities was limited, 
'Twas very rash, the bank went smash, and settled my poor hash. 
Oh! b'lieve me, &c. 
My story is done, so now I'll go away. 
And we say so, and we hope so. 
For nobody here seems to mind what I 
say. 
Oh! poor old man! 
Well, now you know my woes, I 
s'pose you feel inclined to pity 
me, 
I 
guess you must confess that I'm the unluckiest of men. 
But, oh, I 
see you don't mind me, but just want to got rid o' me, 
Well, anyhow I'm going now, but I 
will come again. 
Oh I

He used to take us on his knee, 
And sing us all to rest ; 
But now we are alone,

Around de little cabin door 
Our dear old Uncle Ben. 
He used to roam de cotton fields, 
And help to mow de hay, 
And down de river glide along 
Wid heart so light and gay ; 
Be old plantation was his home, 
Among de fields of corn ; 
'Twas in de old Kentucky State 
Where Uncle Ben was born. 
Poor old Uncle Ben ; etc. 
Dere was no darkey round de place 
Dal massa loved so well ;

While his stories he would tell ; 
Be children dane'd around his feet, 
And all was gladness then ; 
But now they plant sweet roses on 
The grave of Uncle Ben.

Composed by HARRY WooDsoN. 
Sung by the GUIRAN BROTISER. 
OUR names are Jim and Jack Bangun; 
You'll find us always full of fun. 
We're waiters in a 
restaurant, 
And dishes we do sling all day ; 
And at night, when work is over, 
We are gay as bees in clover; 
For two dandy coons like us 
You'll never find so gay. 
If you want a 
good square meal, 
See us turn -upon our heel, 
For we do it up in style, 
Singing, dancing all the while. 
CHORUS. 
Oh ! here we are, the happy waiters ! 
See us sling corned beef and taters. 
When we wait upon the table 
People say we are immense, 
For our style it is so different 
From the others in the restaurant. 
You can get a 
good square meal 
For the sum of fifty cents. 
We have roast beef; we have corned beef; 
We have pickled eels, and pigs' feet, 
Quail on toast, and chicken stew, 
Or turkey stuffed with good, clean hash ; 
Good mutton chops, with veal cutlets, 
Ham and eggs, with some jiblets, 
Buckwheat cakes, and oyster fry, 
With good potato mash. 
Oh! here we are, etc.

BILLY JOHNSON'S BALL.---[CONCLUDEDI 
There were the Jones-es-es, and the Brown-es-ea, 
And the Smith-es- es a 
score, 
The Spriggius-es, the Scoggins-es, 
And half a 
dozen more; 
In Billy's room, there wasn't room, 
To dance a 
decent jig, 
So he went and took a 
big one 
At " The Tinder-box and Piz." 
Spoken.—An efficient band was provided, consisting of a 
fiddle 
tin wnistle, and a 
Jew's harp and they played—Cno. 
They introduced the baby, 
And we kissed it twice all round, 
Mrs. Johnson was quite "overcome," 
Fell fainting to the ground. 
But they " brought her to" with water, 
And " a 
drop of something in," 
And when " she felt herself again," 
The dancing did begin. 
Cuo. 
In and out and round about, 
Such a 
ball was never seen, 
And every now and then, 
We'd " a 
drop to drink between," 
Mils- Johnson he got dancing 
With all the girls he'd find, 
Mrs. Johnson she grew jealous, 
And declared he was " unkind." 
Spoken.

rule never to interfere in family quarrels' 
lo I 
chose 
lovely creature in red and yellow, and we glided into

I 
drank " love" to the Jones-es, 
I 
drank " love" to the Browns, 
I 
tried to keep on dancing, but 
'Twas somehow " ups and downs," 
To tell you how it ended, 
I 
really am not able, 
For I 
found myself next morning 
Lying underneath the table. 
Spoken.—I 
felt rather confused till a 
friend reminded me that

THE theatre was full, it was Dorkins' night, 
That is, Dorkins was going to appear 
At night in a 
favorite comedy part, 
For he was comedian here. - 
Funny ? why, he'd make you laugh 
Till the tears ran down your face like rain, 
And as long as Dorkins was on the stage 
You'd try to stop laughing in vain. 
A 
family ? yes, he'd a 
family, 
And he loved them as dear as life, 
And you'd scarcely find a 
happier lot 
Than Dorkins' children and wife. 
And you'd scarcely find a 
happier lot 
Than Dorkins' children and wife. 
There came one night, 
And I 
was in front, 
And Dorkins was going to play 
A 
character new to himself and the stage 
That he'd trod for so many a 
day. 
By eight the theatre was perfectly crammed, 
All awaited a 
pleasant surprise, 
For they knew they would laugh 
Till their sides would ache, 
And they longed for the curtain to rise. 
The play soon began; 
Each neck was stretched forth, 
And eagerly watched each eye 
For Dorkins to make 
His " first entrance," and then 
To give him a 
cheerful " Hi, hi I" 
DORKINS' NIGHT.—Concluded. 
He soon appeared 
Amid loud applause, 
Dut -something was wrong 
You could see. 
Dorkins is playing 
Quite badly to-night," 
The people said sitting round me. 
A 
hiss ? yes, it was. 
I 
saw Dorkins start 
As though stung by a 
serpent's fang; 
Then he'd. cast a 
beseeching glance all arouni, 
And his head. an his breast would hang. 
He's drunk, and really 
I 
thought so myself. 
For to me it was awful at times 
To see how he'd struggle 
Along with his part, 
And continually stick in his lines. 
The footlights at last 
He approached very slow, 
And, " Ladies and gentlemen," said, 
" 
If I 
cannot please you to-night, 
The fault's not the heart, 
But the head. 
'There's many a 
night 
I've made you all laugh 
When so ill I 
could scarcely 
Well stand, 
And every effort was pain to me then„ 
Yes, if even I 
raised but my ha,nd. 
'You hiss me to-night, 
And think that, I'm drunk 
(From his heart came a 
sob and a 
moan) ; 
I'll tell you the reason— 
I 
know you won't laugh— 
Pre a 
little one dying at home."

I 
Am thinking to- day 
Of dem years dat passed away, 
When dey tied me up in bondage long ago; 
In old Virginny State, 
It was dar we separate, 
And it fill'd my heart with misery and woo. 
Dey took away my boy, 
lie was his mother's joy ; 
From a 
baby in de cradle we him raise; 
Oh, dey put us far apart, 
An' it broke de ole man's heart, 
In dein agonizing, cruel slav'ry days, 
cuoRUS. 
Dey never come again, 
Let us give our praise to Him 
Who looks down whar de little children play ; 
So ev'ry night and morn, 
We will pray for dem dat's gone, 
In dem agonizing, cruel slav'ry days. 
Still my menfry will steal o'er 
To dat dear old cabin floor, 
When de shadow of de sun came peeping ir.; 
At night, when all was dark, 
We would hear de watch- dog bark, 
And we'd listen to de murmur of de wind. 
It seem to say to me, 
" 
You people must be free," 
For de happy time am coming, Lord be prais'd 
For then we would weep and moan, 
For our souls was not our own, 
In dem agonizing, cruel slav'ry days. 
Dy never, etc. 
I 
am very old and feeble, 
And our life am nearly done ; 
I 
have travell'd in the roughest kind of road ; 
Thro' sickness, toil and sorrow, 
I 
have reach'd de end at last, 
And I'm resting by de wayside wid my load. 
Forget now and forgive, 
has always been my guide, 
For dal's what de golden Scripture surely says ; 
But our mein'ry will turn round, 
• When our souls dey were tied down, 
In dem agonizing, cruel slav'ry days.

" SOLID DISHES TO THE FRONT.' 
As sung by BILLY BIRCH of the San Franeiszo Minstrels-
Ant.—" Spring, Gentle Spring." 
BEANS, beans, Boston baked beans, 
Served up red-hot on a 
Sunday  
morn ; 
Beans, beans, Boston baked beans, 
Is a 
dish that is fit for a 
queen, sure's you're borul 
Whenever you go to Boston town, 
Oct some one to show you round ; 
Smoking red-hot on the plates, 
Oh, how I 
love those Yankee dates 
Volt may talk about your good clam chowder, 
Talk about your whiskey sour— 
crionus. 
Give me beans, beans, Boston baked beans, 
Served up red-hot on a 
Sunday morn, 
With coffee, sugar, bread, and cream, 
Is a 
dish that is fit for a 
queen, sure's you're born, 
flash, hash', mysterious bash! 
In a 
second-class hotel you never miss hash; 
flash, hash, beautiful hash ! 
It's a 
hard crowd to tackle, but easy to catch ; 
I've travelled this country thro' and thro', 
This fatuous conundrum is always new; 
Talk of scrambled e,tr-s, crumbs and crust,. 
But mysterious hash is more robust; 
'Reed- birds, quail, champagne and ice, 
Canary birds stuffed is all very nice— 
CHORU S. 
Hash, bast], mysterious hash ! 
In a :iecond-class hotel you never miss hash ; 
Hash, hash, beautiful hash! 
It's a 
bard crowd to tackle, but easy to catch. 
Cheese, cheese, Limburger cheese! 
Floating so gayly and sweet in the breeze ; 
Cheese, cheese, Limburger cheese, 
Drina me a 
dish of sweet Limburger cheese ; 
At Miller's saloon I 
take my ease, 
And revel on lager and Limburger cheese; 
That's the luscious stuff to eat, 
For it makes your breath so sweet. 
Talk of love in Cupid's bowers, 
Talk of the balm of a 
thousand flowers— 
cnonus. 
Cheese, cheese, Limburger cheese! 
Floating so gayly and sweet in the breeze; 
Cheese, cheese, Limbur :2er cheese, 
Bring me a 
dish of sweet Limburger cheese. 
IT'S SURE TO PAY IN TIIE END. 
Ain.—' Poor, but a 
Gentleman still." 
As sung by TONY PASTOR. 
SOME hundreds of mottoes to you have been sung, 
But this I 
can greatly defend, 
It teaches you all for to never do wrong, 
It is sure for to pay in the end ; 
Wherever you be, upon land or on sea, 
Unto this great maxim attend, 
If you'd do unto others as you'd be done by, 
It is sure for to pay in the end. 
CHORUS. 
I'll stand by my motto while life it shall last, 
And the true workingman I'll defend ; 
Stand firm by the anvil, the axe, and the plough ; 
It is sure for to pay in the end. 
Let the nobleman boast of his wealth and his name, 
Of the honors his ancestors won ; 
Let the general who gains in the battle his fame 
Proclaim the great deeds he has done ; 
Let the miser count over his thousands in gold, 
To the dollars he's saved close attend ; 
I 
would rather the workingman's blessing secure, 
It is sure for to pay in the end. 
I'll stand by my motto, etc. 
Our great politicians the people do cheat, 
Our Congressmen draw their back pay, 
And when they have got all the money they can 
From the country they quick run away ; 
But the laboring man is our safeguard and hope, 
The nation must on him depend ; 
Though his troubles are great and his life it is hard, 
lt is sure for to pay in the end. 
I'll stand by my motto, etc. 
The men that wear broadcloth, in diamonds do shine, 
And poverty look at with scorn, 
They had better the wages of fraud quick decline, 
Or, better by far. ne'er been born ; 
'Tis better the dry loaf of poverty eat, 
Where a 
dollar well earned you can spend ; 
'Tis better no one in this world try to cheat, 
It is sure for to pay in the end. 
I'll stand by my motto, etc.

"Well, really now, you seem so bad, your looks I 
am commiserating, 
Sir," she said, " but let me see. I 
must have time to think." 
She appeared so lovely, so bewitching, and so captivating- • 
"Anything you make," I 
said, " my darling. I 
snail drink. ' 
When for some seconds, more or less, this charming girl had stood, 
Said she, •• I 
think an eye-opener, my dear. would do you good ; 
You're queer about the optics, and you're husky in the voice, 
But there's a 
card, with list of drinks, and from it take your choice." 
Spoke-And she handed me the card with such a 
sweet smile, some-
thing like this,-you know the sort of smile-what I 
call the droop. I 
took the card and read as follows-Cnont7s, as before. 
Said I, " A 
private smile from you is really quite as sweet as honey, 
And a lady's blush 
more becoming than a 
frown ; 
A 
pic!,:-llie-up is very nice, and, made by you, worth any money-
r 
a 
enjoy a 
pick-me-up if you would knock me down." 
Said she, " Oh, come now, that's enough, sir. you'ie inclined to rave-
1 
wish you would be quick, and tell me what you're going to have 1" 
Said I. 
How can I 
choose, my dear, from such a 
splendid lot 
I 
can't make up my mind, so I'll have everything you've got." 
,Sp'ok.ol-" What," sail she, " everything " Yes," I 
replied, " every-
thing on the list."-Cuonus, as before. 
Said she. " Now don't be stupid, for to take them all would be such folly, 
One or two I'd recommend, but pray don't take the lot ; 
For, as all the drinks are iced, sir, the result would be most melancholy, 
I 
am very certain you would freeze upon the spot." 
Said I. " I 
wouldn't care a 
pin, I'd think it rather nice, 
A 
smile from vou, I'm very sure. would quickly melt the ice ; 
And. as I 
must make up my mind, my choice at once I'll take, 
Indulge me, please, by mixing a 
luxurious rattlesnake." 
,svpokert -- I 
did enjoy it, too, it slid down my throat so beautifully, and 
was so nice that I 
was induced to try the lot- , she couldn't attend to any - 
ody else, she was so busy mixing for me. Now you, take my advice, boys, 
if ever you feel seedy, just turn into the Café Riche, 226 Piccadilly ; ask 
for the proprietor and mention my name-that'll be quite sufficient, you'll 
be turned out immediately. 
But before you go, say, " I 
want to taste some 
of your American drinks I've heard so much about." " Indeed !" he'll 
ejaculate, " I'm glad to hear they are spoken of in such complimentary 
terms ; will you have one with me ? " " Thanks," you'll say, " I 
don't

BILL SMITH'S ADVENTURE. 
Composed and sung by GEORGE IIAnms, with great success-
BILL SMITH was a 
swell of the highest degree; 
He lived in the grandest of style; 
He was fond of a 
joke and a 
bit of a 
spree, 
And was full of his pranks all the while. 
Handsome ! Yes, Bill was the pride of the girls ; 
At a 
theatre, or party, or ball, 
If he wanted a 
partner to dance in a 
set 
lie could, sure, have the pick of them all, 
For Bill had some ducats his dad to him left— 
Had both beauty and wealth to command, 
And he thought he could do what he liked in this world, 
And as king of the universe stand. 
(Repeat.) 
'T was a 
cold winter's night, at the midnight hour, 
The snow as a 
white sheet did fall, 
Bill Smith, flushed with wine and good things of thik; 
life, 
Rode home from a 
masquerade ; 
The carriage it stopped when it got to his doo::, 
• 
And Bill from the steps did alight, 
As a 
voice, cracked and shrill, in sad accents did cry, 
" 
Great God! have some pity this night." 
BILL SMITH'S ADVENTURE .—Concluded. 
Bill turned quick around, as a 
weak, shivering form 
Stood a 
barrier frail in his way. 
Bill pushed her aside, to be lost in the storm, 
As shone through the gloom a 
bright ray. 
(Repeat) 
Bill saw by the light of the moon's ray that fell 
The gleam of a 
sorrowful face, 
With sparkling eyes, of bright azure blue, 
Which for years he did never efface. 
Slumber ! In vain wished for slumber that night ; 
He sleepless and restless did roll ; 
The two eyes of blue lie had lost in the storm 
Had seized on his innermost soul. 
The daylight it came, and the storm still did rage, 
Poor Bill, he looked care-like and worn ; 
But he hastily dressed, and passed out to the street 
In the break of that cold wintry morn. 
(Repeat.) 
Bill marched sternly on through the snow and the sleet ; 
'Twas an angel that guided his path, 
And his beacons of light were those bright eyes of blue 
He had thrust in the storm in his wrath. 
Dying ! Yes, cold in the park there did lie, 
On a 
bench 'neath a 
willow- tree's shade, 
The houseless one's form Bill had thrust in the night— 
The poor and forlorn homeless maid. 
Bill lifted her up with his strong, stalwart arm, 
And pressed her with joy to his heart ; 
As she opened her eyes the bright sunlight shone out, 
And the night and the storm did depart. 
A.h ! why should I 
recall them— the gay, the joyous years, 
Ere hope WaS cross'd Or pleasure dimm'd by sorrow and 
by tears ? 
Or \\ hy should mem'ry love to trace youth's glad and 
sunlit way, 
When tliose %Nil° made its charms so sweet are gal hered to 
decay ? 
The summer's sun shall come again to blighted hill and 
1
)0 
The teeming earth its fragrance bring beneath the balmy 
shower; 
But all in vain 
vill menfry strive, in vain we shed onr 
tears— 
They're gone away and can't return— the friends of boy-
hood's years! 
Alt ! why then wake my sorrow, and bid me n w count' 
o'er 
The vanished friends so dearly prized— the days to conic 
no more— 
The happy days of infancy, when ito guile our bosoms 
knew, 
Nor reek'd we of the pleasures that with each moment 
flew ? 
'Tis all in vain to weep for them-- the past a di eam 
appeal s ; 
And where are they— the lov'd, the young, the friends of 
boyhood's years? 
Go seek them in the cold church-yard—they long have 
stolen to rest ; 
But do not Nveep. for their young cheeks by woe were 
ne'er oppressed : 
Life's sun for them in splendour set— no cloud cant( 
the ray 
That lit them from this gloomy world upon their joyous 
way. 
No tears about their graves be shed—but sweetest flow'rs 
be flung— 
The fittest offring thou mist make to hearts that perish 
you lig— 
To hearts this world has never torn with racking, hopes; 
and fears ; 
For bless' , 1 
are tiny who pass away m boyhood's happy 
years.

I'su a 
longing for de good ole times we used to bab of yore 
When we labor'd in de cotton and de corn, 
And eb'ry night de darkeys g,ather'd ' round de cabin door 
To de calling of de mellow bugle horn; 
We would dance and we would sing to de banjo's happy ring, 
Be ole fiddle and de bones made music too, 
And eb'ry charming yaller gal would to her lover cling, 
While all our hearts were honest, kind and true. 
We would dance and we would sing to de banjo's happy ring, 
Be ole fiddle and de bones made music too, 
And eb'ry charming yaller gal would to her lover cling, 
While all our hearts were honest, kind and true. 
Our ole Massa used to like de fun, and laugli'd to see de reels 
Dat de boys and gals were always sure to dance, 
And when de ' piccaninny nigs" would turn upon dar heels, 
Be ole man would j'ine dem in dar merry prance; 
Tim' he used to give us blows when among de cotton rows, 
He was kind to us when daily toil was o'er, 
And eb'ry one dat work'd upon de ole plantation knows 
His heart was bigger den our sunny shore. 
We would dance, etc. 
We have heard he j'ined de army after sending us away, 
And was killed in battle down in Tennessee,

0, the time's don- gone whea massa used to say: 
Turn out. Pompey, at the break of day— 
Hurry down the hoe-cake mid shoulder the hoe, 
And over the creek to the cane field go.

And Chloe and the children all belong to me, 
And this child's happy as happy can be.

Hungry and weary, faint and sore ;

DEAD IN . LOVE. 
Words by ITAIMY BENNET. 
Sung with great success by Iiannr W OODSON at the Howard Athernrum, 
Boston. 
I'm in love with a 
charming young damsel ; 
She's a 
native of Ireland in Greece, 
And her father knits socks for the sparrows, 
While her mother is on the police. 
She can wrestle mince pies like a 
darling, 
Or juggle a 
big schooner of beer. 
She's a 
thorough- bred long-winded luncher, 
With a 
seven pound wart on her ear. 
This young girl is a 
talented eater, 
And the grub that she stuffs down her throat 
Would supply a 
whole orphan asylum, 
Or sink a 
large-sized ferry-boat. 
She can swallow a 
whole water-melon, 
And to bite it she never will stoop ; 
She can take forty encores on lager, 
And she likes rubber shoes in her soup. 
0, her mouth's like a 
busted tomattus, 
And her eyes like an overgrown moon, 
And she stands seven feet in her ear-rings, 
With a 
head like a 
bar-room spittoon ; 
And she sleeps with her feet in the hallway, 
For she can't get them inside the doo-
f. 
If I 
marry this healthy young lady 
I'll buy out a 
Dutch grocery store.

PsE a-gettin' old an' feeble, an' my bar is turning gray, 
An' my feet am weary roaming ' round de earth, 
An' if I 
was only able I 
would soon be on my way 
Back to Dixie an' de ole home of my birth ; 
But dar ain't no use in trying, for I

An' my heart is fill'd with sadness an' wid pain ; 
For my heart is bin a-sighin' for de friends I

For de happy days when I

When we use to hoe de cotton an' de sugar-cane an' corn, 
An' my feet was eber ready for to come ; 
But I'd like to go to Dixie for to see de home again,

For I

CHORUS. 
Singing, oh, dear! what queer things have sprung 
Since de safe ole times when dis nigger was young, 
In de days I 
was young, nigger's wool didn't hang high, 
Poultry sold cheap and chickens wasn't shangbigh ; 
Young folks went to meetin' an' didn't go to musses, 
And folks went into hominy instead of honmybusses. 
Singing, oh, dear! etc. 
In dem ole times, why a 
church wasn't a

An' the pulpit didn't wear clothes like a 
play-house ; 
Den folks sung together by the sigh of dar voices. 
An' dey didn't pay the choir for nialdn' all de noises. 
Singing, oh, dear! etc. 
On de ole turnpike char was no railway crashes, 
Den de liquor still didn't make the brandy smashes ; 
Folks didn't get frightened at too many news, 
Den cobblers didn't burn soles, but (ley mended shoes.

" 
DORKINS WAS TIGHT." 
Written by BENJ. D. 
COLLINS. Sung by Gus W ILLIAMS. 
THE theatre was full, and so were the actors, 
Dan Dorkins was going to appear 
That night in a 
bare-footed slack-wire clog, 
For he was the Pompey round here. 
The bar-room was fearfully crowded with beats 
Who awaited a 
pleasant surprise ; 
For they knew they would eat 
When the lunch was set out, 
And they longed for the curtain to rise. 
The curtain arose, and so did the people, 
Who began to shout and hurrah ; 
Dan Dorkins came out with young Oliver Twist, 
But they gave him the laugh and yah I 
yah 
The play it began when the curtain went up, 
But something was wrong I 
felt sure ; 
" 
He's away off his base," says John Jas. Mansfield, 
That never went back on the poor. 
A 
brick—well it was—I 
saw Dorkins start, 
And carom on the dark red for two ; 
And it made me feel thirsty to see how he worked, 
But continually dropping his cue. 
He says, "I'm the kilig," when a 
woman jumped up 
Cried, " you lie, for you're one of the gang, 
And you owe me for washing." That knocked Dorkins 
cold, 
And his head on his breast did hang. 
At length the footlights he approached with a 
rush, 
And " Ladies and gentlemen," said, 
" 
If I 
haven't drank enough bourbon to-night, 
The fault is my wealth, not my head. 
Many a 
time I 
have made you all sick, 
And get up and go out for a 
beer ; 
When me and Jim Stokes walked a 
mile in a 
week, 
How I 
wish Dan O'Leary was here. 
ion insult me to-night and say I 
am sober, 
For years I've been a 
Hamlet alone ; 
I'll tell you the reason, I 
know you will treat, 
I've a 
mother-in-law dead—drunk at home." 
When I 
was a 
little nig, no bigger dan anoder, 
De people used to say I 
was de image ob my milder, 
My ha'r was curly as a 
girl's— my nose it was a 
snorter. 
And as I 
grew, 
My lips turned blue, 
Because I 
loved my porter— Spoken.—" Dat was me." 
CHORUS. 
A little more porter do, do. " 
Dat was me." 
A 
little more porter for Illy daughter, 
A little more porter do. 
(Repeat chorus.) 
Oh, dear. I 
feel so happy, I 
don't know what to do, 
I 
fell in htb Wid a yaller gal," and dey call her Bowery 
Sue ; 
She looks so sweet-, 
when in de street—she is a 
reolar 
sporter— 
She's tall and fat 
As a 
1'hoinas cat 
By de side of her sweet porter. 
Spoken.—" Dat's me." 
A little more Porter, tke. 
Some day we shall get married— if I 
can raise de money, 
Well buy a 
hoss, and I'll be boss by de side of my sweet 
honey, 
And as de little niggers come— both little sons and daugh 
ters. 
"id eyes so bright, 
And teeth so white, 
You'll know dey is young Porters. 
Spoken.—Becos dey'll be de sons ob Liar old fadder—and 
dat'll be me.

C031E AND LET I1S REASON TOGETHER." 
It has been well said that he that ca.anot reason is a 
fool; he 
that dare not reason is a 
slave; he that will not reason is a 
bigot. 
We do not believe, good reader, that you belong to either of 
these three classes, and therefore address -ourselves to you. 
You will have -noticed that every Doctor, after feeling the 
pulse, looking at the tongue, and ascertaining the temperature 
of the body, pauses for a 
moment's thought. 
Then lie -quickly 
•asks, 
Are 'your bowels regular 'I " 
This you will therefore 
notice is the very itey-note by which he seeks to know 
whether you are healthy or diseased. 
By further questions in 
the same direction he learns the particular nature of the dis-
ease. 
But no odds how many :different points he may wander 
to, he soon returns to the digestive organs. 
The disease may be most apparent in the lungs, the kidneys, 
the heart, the liver, the head; but it is always the bowels he 
treats as the salient pointof disease that has to be first treated, 
hence the first medicine prescribed is a 
dose to act upon the 
organs of digestion. 
This is wisdom. 
The doctor knows that 
-Without thorough digestion half the food taken is 
worse than useless. 
As certain things strewn around become 
incorporated with the soil and nourish it (left in a 
compact 
heap they breed disease), so without an active digestion food is 
hurtful. 
These are truths that no sane man will attempt to 
gainsay. 
What is the remedy I Surely a 
medicine powerful 
enough to carry iiff all injurious matter, and at the same time 
having such balsamic qualities as will heal any inflammations 
that may have arisen in the lining of the different ducts. 
Now 
the very best thing that can be used to do what all doctors 
recommend is Merlin's Health Granules. Pleasant 
to take, easy in operation, and leaving lasting good effects after 
their use. 
This is homely, sound doctrine. 
Try, and be con-
vinced. 
Merlin's Uealtit Granules do not compete 
with any other aperient medicine; they simply extinguish 
them. 
The sun don't fight with a 
penny dip, it merely out-
shines it.

Lads! ho! yeo ho ! yeo ho ! 
There's none like Nancy Lee I 
trow, 
Yeo ho! lads, ho ! yeo ho! 
See there she stands an' waves her hands, upon the quay; 
Au' ev'ry day, when I'm away, she'll watch for me; 
An' whisper low, when tempests blow, 
For Jack at sea. yeo ho ! lads, ho! yea ho 
CHORUS. 
The sailor's wife the sailor's star shall be I 
Yeo ho! we go across the sea.

DON'T WAIT TILL T.0- MORROW 
If you feel any symptoms of Jaundice or other complaints be-
ginning in a 
non- acting Liver. 
The bile is stopped, and not 
doing its duty. 
Soon follow torpidity, congestion, mor-
tification, DEATH. Take at once a 
full dose of Mer-
lin's Health Granules. That will stop the disease. 
NERVOUS DEBILITY 
is the curse of civilization. 
Luckily it can be cured. 
It pro-
ceeds from intense mental strain; from violating physical laws, 
throwing the reins on the neck of Passion. The body becomes 
impaired, the mind follows suit, then the weak body and the 
irresolute mind plague each other, and drive the poor wretch 
to mental imbecility; but, as we- have said, Nervous Debility 
can be cured; the diseased humors can be driven from the 
blood; the stomach becomes strong and active, the heart 
bounds to its work, the mind follows suit, black despair flies, 
health returns, not by any miracle, but simply by using the 
great remedy, Merlin's Health Granules. One box 
has been known to bring a 
poor wretch from the edge of the 
grave. 
Do your bones ache l You are either filled with Malarial 
Poison or there lingers in your system the dire effects of an-
cestral indiscretions and the Mercurial Poisons never driven 
out. 
But do not despair. 
By judiciously using the never-
failing remedy, Merlin's Health Granules, the poison-
ous atoms are expelled to give place to pure, strength- giving 
blood. 
THE PRESENT DAY 
is the time to try and get well. 
The ounce of prevention is 
the thing. 
Don't wait till you have to get the pound of cure. 
Stop the first small leak. 
Don't wait till the ship is water-
logged. 
Disease is absolutely prevented by using Mer-
lin's Health Granules as a 
family medicine.

aiDITNNY MORGAN'. 
Sung by JAcK CONROY. 
I'LL sing of a 
band that used to play 
Music in the street, 
And if you heard it you would say 
It was anything but sweet. 
They all played different instruments; 
The music was the same. 
They were all one family, 
And Morgan was their name. 
CHORUS. 
Johnny Morgan played the organ; 
The father beat the drum ; 
The sisters played the tambourine ; 
The brother went porn, porn, porn, porn. 
All alone on an old trombone. 
The music was so sweet 
They often got a 
penny to go 
Into another street. 
They used to say that Johnny 
Was the smartest of them all, 
And around the area windows 
He would often make a 
call. 
Ms music was so lively, 
All the latest airs from France, 
The servant-girls could not keep still, 
The music made them dance. 
Johnny Morgan, etc. 
sow, one day John he chanced to play 
Outside a 
lady's door, 
And the lady said she'd never heard 
Such music played before. 
It pleased her so that you must know 
She heavy sums would pay 
To John to stand outside the house 
And play to her all day. 
Johnny Morgan, etc. 
John played upon his instrument, 
And pleased the lady so 
That when the time arrived to leave 
She would not let him go. 
She asked if lie would marry her, 
Which John did very soon. 
Now on the organ Johnny Morgan 
Plays iirr many a 
tune. 
Johnny Morgan, et-, 
FEVER. 
Beware the first approaches of this stealthy foe, that cometh 
like a 
thief in the night. 
A 
change of drinking- water, unripe 
fruit, a 
debauch, a 
slight cold may be the first clutch of Fewer. 
It can be guarded against and repelled by a 
timely use of 
Merlin's Health Granules. A person should never 
travel to the mountains, to the sea- shore, or on the ocean with-
out a 
supply. 
Doctors admit this fact, and they don't speak 
well of any medicine unless its merits are very great. 
DVSPEPSIN, the arch-fiend of misery and decay, can 
be cured effectually by a 
persistent use of Itler:ites 
Granules. Why 
Because these Granules go to the 
very root of the complaint. 
They not only drive out the fecu-
lent matter that clogs the avenues of the body, but they in-
vigorate and give tone to the digestive apparatus, and make 
healthful blood flow through every petty artery ; then conies 
a 
good appetite, and good food insures a 
lasting cure. 
In the Cholera Years it was found that the first 
thing needed was to drive out of the stomach and bowels the 
noxious germs of the destroyer. 
Nothing is so effectual for 
this purpose as Merlin's Health GralflUICS, for while 
they are very powerful for good they are harmless for evil. 
A child may take them in moderation, while they can be 
made to operate upon the strongest man. 
" 
I 
DON 'T KNOW WHAT AILS DIE !" 
Bow often do we hear this remark. A 
man or woman grows 
weak, feeble, irresolute. 
As Hamlet says, " Man delights not 
me, nor woman either." 
This feeling arises from many causes. 
Lack of exercise, loss of appetite, deep grief— all these tend to 
render the fluids of the body heavy, thick, sluggish. 
There 
was a 
health-lesson taught by the angel stirring the pool be-
fore the sick got any benefit from its waters. 
It needed action, 
vitalizing with pure air. 
This is precisely the effect produced 
by Merlin's Health Gran tiles. The sluices are cleaned, 
and the nutriment finds its way where it is wanted and can do 
most good.

BABY MINE. 
The 'Music of this song is Published by SPEAR & Dzurtnorr, 717 Broad-
way, N. Y. 
I'VE a 
letter from thy sire, 
Baby mine— baby mine; 
I 
could read and never tire, 
Baby mine—baby mine. 
He is sailing o'er the sea, 
He is coming back to me, 
He is coming back to me, 
Baby mine—baby mine, 
He is coming back to me, 
Baby mine. 
Oh ! I 
long to see his face, 
Baby mine—baby mine, 
In his old accustomed place, 
Baby mine—baby mine. 
Like the rose of May in bloom, 
Like a 
star amid the gloom, 
Like the sunshine in the room, 
Baby mine—baby mine, 
Like the sunshine in the room, 
Baby mine. 
I'm so glad I 
cannot sleep, 
Baby mine—baby mine, 
I'm so happy I 
could weep, 
Baby mine—Baby mine. 
He is sailing o'er the sea, 
He is coming home to me. 
He is coming back to thee, 
Baby mine—baby mine, 
He is coming back to thee, 
Baby mine.
