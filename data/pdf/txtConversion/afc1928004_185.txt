Won't you tell me, Mollie darling, 
That you love none else but me, 
For I 
love you, Mollie darling, 
You are all the world to me.

Look up. darling, tell me this; 
Do you love me, Mollie darling, 
Let your answer be a 
kiss. 
Stars are smiling, Mollie darling, 
Thro' the mystic veil of night; 
They seem laughing, Mollie darling, 
While fair Luna hides her light. 
01 no one listens but the flowers, 
While they hang their heads in shame, 
They are modest, Mollie darling, 
When they hear me call your name. 
Mollie, fairest, &e. 
I 
must leave you, Mollie darling, 
Tho' the parting gives me pain ; 
When the stars shine, Mollie darling, 
I 
will meet you here again. 
0! good- night, Mollie, good-bye, loved one, 
Happy may you ever be, 
When you're dreaming, Mollie darling, 
Don't forget to dream of me.

I 
fell in love with a 
pretty girl, 
A few Omit years ago. 
All sorts of weather, hail or rain, 
To court her I 
would go; 
I'd lon ,r 
and sigh with love until 
'Twos time to be away, 
And when I 
asked a 
parting kiss, 
She always used to say: 
C 
II ORUS.

Oh. mother says I 
mustn't, mother says I 
mustn't 1 
Oh, George. please. George, not just yet awhile; 
Mother says I 
at 
mother says I 
mustn't 
Oh, George, don't, George, not just yet. 
I " waiting" kept, at last, one day, 
I 
thought I'd know my fate, 
I 
sunk upon my knees in quite 
An agonizing state ; 
" 
Selina, say you'll have your George, 
And when shall we be wed I" 
I 
longed to hear my love's reply, 
And this is what she said— 
Spoken—Well, George, dear, you're very kind, but we could never 
live on two hundred a. year, so until y 
ea are worth at least five 
hundred per annum, darling— 
Mother says I 
mustn't, &c. 
From then I 
went to work, by Jove! 
I 
left no stone unturned, 
Until five hundred pounds a 
year. 
At last I 
really earned ; 
Selina heard how things had changed, 
And when we met o e 
day, 
Sbe seemed so pleasant, and at last 
She lovingly did say— 
Spoken—You remember, George, dear, what I 
said when you asked 
me some time ago,—well, George, oear, as you have so improved k 
circumstances, suppose you ask me now, Georgy, Porgey, darling 
eh, what say ? 
Well, said I, upon consideration you're very kind, but— 
Mother says I 
mustn't, &c. 
Give me the girl who loves a 
man, 
And loves hint tor himself, 
Whose first consideration is, not 
what he's worth in pelf: 
All sordid-minded damsels, who 
May worship golden dn ,ss. 
May they lie old maids till they die, 
And we'll never feel their loss— 
Spoken— So ladies who don't want to be old maids, mind yen, don't 
once too often say— 
Mother says I 
mustn't, &a. 
WHEN THE BAND BEGINS TO PLAY. 
Written and composed by G. W. H UNT. 
I'm very fond of music— to me its quite a 
treat, 
Unless it be from German Bands, or Organs in the street. 
Thro' list'ning to a 
band o 
le day, I 
fairly lost my heart 
The leader ' twas who found it and he now with it won't part. 
CLIO I 
:
US. 
Oh ! I 
feel so awfully jolly when the band begins to play, 
When the band begins to play, when the band begins to play. 
I'm very fond of music I 
could listen all the day, 
Especially when my Charlie leads the band—Porn, Porn. 
My Charlie is my darling—the beau ideal of loves, 
With his hair so black dud curly, and his whitest of white gloves. 
My love stands in the middle, NV i ; h his baton in his hand, 
An 1 
leads the instrumentalists in a 
style that I 
think grand. 
Oh I 
I 
feel so awfully jolly when the band begins to play, &c. 
They play such jolly music—waltz, polka, and quadrille, 
And sometimes play so feelingly, it gives me a 
quite thrill, 
The leader sometimes gives a 
frown, and looks as though he's rash; 
And then they play so soft and sweet, and after comes a 
crash. 
Oh I 
I 
feel so awfully jelly when the band begins to play, &c. 
Now, where my Charlie's to be seen, I 
don't intend to tell, 
For fear that he might captivate some other belle as well. 
Ile's asked me " one small question,"—I 
gave him my reply— 
In about a 
month there will not be a 
happier wife than I. 
Oh! I 
feel so awfully jolly when the band begins to play, &e.

STROLLING ON THE E.:AND. 
Of course we all know Ramsgate well, 
That spot to thous nds dear, 
Where dashing belles and heavy swells, 
Assemble ev'ry year : 
Sonic like to roam along the Pier. 
And view what that commands, 
But my delight, from morn till night, 
Is strolling on the sands. 
Strolling on the sands, strolling on the sands, 
Watching all the bathers dip, list'ning to the baud ; 
Strolling on the sands, strolling on the sands, 
In cool or heat there's nought to beat a 
stroll upon the sands. 
I'll ne'er forget last summer-time, 
I 
spent a 
fortnight there, 
And made the sweet acquaintance of 
A lovely lady fair, 
She'd gone to bathe at Dumpton Gap, 
Dot, oh ! the naughty quean, 
For once she thought she'd do without 
That vile bathing machine. 
no placed her clothes upon the beach. 
Then in the water played. 
DIA when she tried to come on shore, 
Oh ! wasn't she dismayed ; 
The tide had turn'd, and all her clothes 
Were floating out to sea, 
She'd nothing but her bathing dress— 
In what a 
plight to be. 
fetch'd her mother to her aid, 
And saved all further strife, 
The maiden said, " this great event 
I'll think of all my life." 
We soon became the heist of friends 
For all enjoy'd the fun ; 
We're lovers now—and soon we two 
Are going to be one.

I've been waiting for more than an hour, love, 
Yes waiting and watching for thee, 
While hoping and praying you'd come, love, 
And keep true your promise to me ;

And listen to what I've to say, 
Tim' to speak the plain truth 1

I'm waiting fair lady for thee. 
CHORUS. 
I'm waiting, yes waiting, Pm waiting my darling for thee, 
I'm waiting, yes waiting, I'm waiting my darling for thee. 
For more than a 
year I 
have waited, 
That promise from you to receive, 
So surely you'll not break your word love, 
Nor leave me your absence to grieve; 
So I'll wait and still watch here yet longer, 
In hope of your coming this way, 
When the dim misty veil of the twilight, 
Ilath shut out the brightness of day. 
By the lillies that float down the river, 
By the cowslips that grow on the lea, 
By the roses that bloom in the forest, 
I'm waiting fair lady for thee. 
I'm waiting, dic.

" 
I'll sit at the window," said Granny, 
And watch the garden gate, 
For I 
fancy that idle lad, sailor Dick, 
Will write to my bonnie Kate ; 
For she's moped and sighed all day, 
Since the ships were sent away, 
And early or late, she looks at the gate, 
For the Post, I'll be bound to say, 
For the Post, I'll be bound to say." 
But the twittering swallows under the eave 
Looked laughing from their nest; 
For the birds and bees, and sighing trees, 
Soon whispered Granny to rest. 
And when by the rosemary bed, 
Kate heard the Postman's tread, 
Past Granny's closed eyes, she seized her prize 
And back to her spinning she sped, 
And back to her spinning she sped.

Tap, tap, tapping at the garden gate I 
Every night I 
have heard of late, 
Somebody tapping at the garden gate. 
Wnat, you sly little puss. don't know 1 
Why do you blush and falter so ? 
What are you looking for under the chair? 
The tap. tap, tapping comes not from there. 
Every night about half-past eight, 
There's tap, tap, tapping at the garden gate; 
Every night about half-past right, 
There's tap, tap, tapping at the garden gate 
Oh! you sly little " fox" you know, 
Fidgeting aoout until you go t 
Dropp'd the sugar-spoon 1 
why, there it lies, 
Bless the girl, where are your eyes ? 
Were I 
able to leave my chair. 
Soon would I 
find out who is there. 
Don't tell me yon think it's the cat ; 
Cats don't tap, tap. tap like that ! 
Cats don't know when it's half-past eight, 
And come tap, tapping at the garden gate.

But alas, ' tis long in coming, 
For she's dead, my Sadie Ray. 
Oft I

There is room here for another, 
Come and kiss your Sadie."

THE LITTLE ONF.R • &I
LO E • 
By 
C. 
T. 
LOCKWOOD. 
I 
am thinking now of home, among my native hills, 
And though afar through distant lands I 
roam, 
The memories of the past my heart with longing fills, 
To see the darling little ones at home. 
Ali I 
now their forms I 
seem to see, 
Far o'er the rolling ocean's foam, 
And hear their voices ringing in merry childish glee, 
Oh, I 
long to see the little ones at home. 
CHORUS. 
The little ones at home, the little ones at home, 
I 
long to see the little ones at home, 
And hear their voices ringing in merry childish glee, 
Oh, I 
long to see the little ones at home. 
LAST TIME. 
Soon shall I 
hear your voices in merry childish glee_ 
Proclaim the joyous welcome, welcome home. 
The moon looks mildly down, the same as oft before, 
And bathes the earth in floods of mellow light, 
But its beams are not so bright upon this lonely shore. 
As they seemed at home one year ago to-night. 
Sadly my heart still turns to thee, 
Wherever I 
may chance to roam, 
I 
hear your voices ringing in merry childish glee, 
Oh, I 
long to see my little ones at home. 
The little ones at home, cte. 
May guardian angels still their vigils o'er thee keep, 
May heaven's choicest blessings on thee rest, 
Till I 
am safely borne across the stormy deep, 
And meet again with those I 
love the best. 
Soon, soon your faces I 
shall see, 
Never, never more from thee to roam; 
Soon shall I 
hear your voices in merry childish glee, 
Proclaim the joyous welcome, welcome home. 
The little ones at home, &v.. 
LITTLE DAISY. 
As sung by JOHNNY Noidusr. 
There's a 
light-hearted maiden who lives in the vale, 
And they call her the modest little Daisy, 
When my day's work is done to see her I 
ne'er fail. 
Tito' her beauty it nearly drives me crazy. 
By day or night where e'er Igo her blue eyes on me beam, 
Laughing like the dancing moonlight gleaming on a 
running stream. 
CHORUS. 
Oh Darling Daisy, ' tis of thee I 
dream, 
With thy blue eyes beaming, brighter ne'er was seen. 
Oh Darling Daisy still of thee I 
dream, 
Laughing like the dancing moonlight gleaming on a 
running stream. 
When away from my work thro' the weary long day, 
Thro the hours; oft, I 
feel sad and lonely, 
But when Daisy I 
see all my fears pass away, 
Tho' she whispers she loves me only. 
By day or night where e'er I 
go, her blue eyes on me beam. 
Laughing like 
the dancing moonlight gleaming on a 
running stream. 
CHORUS. 
Oh Darling Daisy, tis of thee I 
dream, 
With thy blue eyes beaming brighter ne'er was seen. 
Oh Darling Daisy still of thee I 
dream, 
Laughing like the dancing moonlight gleaming on a 
running stream.

sweeter far 
far than moon or star, Whilst court-ing in the rain. 
The rain poured down alarmingly, 
When to a 
tree we came, 
And shelter took beneath it, 
There I 
quickly learned her name. 
She also told me where she lived, 
With pa down at the farm; 
A farmer's daughter! well, said 
That is an extra charm. 
Spoken.—I 
glory in country life, and a 
farmer's daughter, what could be 
better; I 
wish'd the rain would keep on as I 
rather liked— 
Courting in the rain, Ike. 
At length the rain abated, 
And the sun shone out quite bright, 
And the little birds began to sing, 
My heart it felt so light. 
I 
gently press'd her arm in mine, 
And said now don't say"nay," 
But let me come and meet you here 
Again some other day. 
Spoken.—Well, she said, I 
can't exactly decide, you roust ask my pa. Go 
I 
made up my mind to go, and inform the old gentleman we'd been— 
Courting in the rain, tte. 
We reach'd the old farm-house, and then 
She introduced to me 
Her pa, a 
jolly nice old boy, 
With him I 
made quite free. 
I 
told him when and where I'd met 
His daughter in the rain, 
And bless'd the lucky chance that took 
Me down that country lane. 
Spoken.—The old gentleman was quite delighted with my kind atten-

NEATH THE WILD PRAIRIE. 
As sung by LIZZIE LAGRAliCE of H OWE'S Circus* 
Oh, Norah, dear Norah, you're going to leave us 
To better your fortune you tempt the rough main, 
But think oh : mavorneen, how sadly ' twill grieve us, 
To think we may never behold thee again. 
Let me fold you once more to my poor heart that's breaking, 
God guara you, my darling, where 'er you be, 
In a 
far distant land send a 
sigh or a 
token, 
That you'll never forget us and old Ireland again.: 
CHORUS. 
Neath the wild western prairie, 
Poor .Norah lies sleeping, ! 
Far away from the village, 
Of Ca-hir-ci-veen. 
Oh : flatter me not with your speedy returning, 
Few, few, that come back from that bright distant land. 
Keep the star of your land in your inmost soul burning, 
Ad 
kiss the green hills for you'll see them no more, 
Oh ! blame me not then that my hot tears are starting, 
All ready in fancy the sea rolls between, 
And the light of our home like a 
dream is departing, 
And may never return to old Ireland again. 
CHORUS 
Neath the wild western prairie, 
Poor Norab lies sleeping, 
Far away from the village, 
01 Ca-hir-ci-veen. 
DANCING IN THE MOONLIGHT. 
SONG AND DANCE . 
A s 
Sung by LIZZIE LA 
GRANGE, of Howe's Circus. 
One pleasant Summer's evening 
Some lady friends of mine 
Had given a 
moonlight pic-nic, 
And I 
was asked to join. 
The time and place was stated. 
And finally we met ; 
How anxiously I 
Nvaited, 
I 
never can forget. 
The time came round and there I 
found 
That all was bright as sunlight ; 
The ladies fair with flowing hair, 
Were dancing in the moonlight. 
CHORUS. 
Balance to your partners, then the music played, 
Alamand corners, all promenade, 
The sweet one then came to me 
With smiles as bright as sunlight, 
But soon we were both happy there, 
While dancing in the moonlight. 
But soon we left the dancers, 
And sought a 
shady nook, 
And while they danced the lancers, 
A private chat we took ; 
The music from a 
distance. 
Came wafted on the breeze, 
'Twas food for our loves cadence, 
And set our hearts at ease. 
We spoke of love, the stars above 
That showered on its their bright light, 
In dusk and dew, I 
bent me low 
And kissed her in the moonlight. 
The dancing now was over, 
And here and there was found, 
The gentle love and lover 
Conversing on the ground, 
But where was me and mine own, 
Unnoticed by the rest, 
In bliss until the it 
Sweet head lay on my breast, 
She to my question answered yes, 
Which almost killed me outright, 
A memory bright of that sweet night, 
Comes dancing in the moonlight. 
Balance &c.

SONG AND DANCE. 
As sang by LIzzin LA GRANGE, of Howe' Circus. 
Way dOW11 iii old Virginny, 
Where I 
was bred and born, 
That rosy, sunny country, 
I 
used to hoe the corn, 
In childhood's happy moments, 
My heart was light and gay, 
I've been to see my birth-place. 
For I 
couldn't stay away. 
CHORUS . 
For I 
couldn't, nor I 
wouldn't, 
I 
couldn't stay away from there, 
For I 
wouldn't ',? ause I 
couldn't, 
Deed I 
couldn t 
stay away. 
I 
once did love a 
yellow- gal, 
Way down in Dixie's land, 
And I 
one day the question popp'd, 
To give me her heart and hand. 
Says she to me my heart's been won, 
And from me you must stay, 
But she was only joking, 
And I 
couldn't stay away. 
CHORUS . 
For I 
couldn't, nor I 
wouldn't, 
I 
couldn't stay away from there, 
For I 
wouldn't 'cause I 
couldn't, 
Deed I 
couldn't stay away. 
Oh ! I'm love with a 
pretty little girl, 
I 
met while out one day, 
She's as lovely as a 
flower in bloom 
And she's got such a 
fascinating way, 
Her eye is bright, her step is light, 
I 
watch her every hour 
As she trips right along singing this song, a 
Just as happy as a 
little Sun Flower. 
Oh ! my love she is a 
fairy, 
Her step so bright and airy, 
If I 
could make only her mine, 
How happy I 
would be, 
We'd dress so fine, now wouldn't we cut a 
shine, 
'This little Sun Flower and me. 
Oh ! I 
might go and see her now, 
I 
promised her I 
would, 
I 
could not disappoint her, 
For she to me is good. 
I'm going to ask her to be mine, 
I 
hope she wont refuse, 
It would break my heart from her to part, 
This little Sun Flower so true. 
CHORUS . 
Oh ! my love she is a 
fairy, 
Her step so bright and airy, 
If I 
could only make her mine, 
How happy I 
would be, 
We'd dress so fine now wouldn't we cut a 
shine, 
This little Sun Flower and me..

While up in the blue heaven's bowers. 
Rings sweetly the nighingale's lay.

With fondest of hopes in my heart, 
I'll wait where the brooklet is running,— 
Then fly birdie quickly depart ;

And there in the oak's spreading shadows, 
Our love for each other we'll tell.

But fly dont delay on your passage, 
And tell her be sure to be there.

Behold in me a 
wretched man, quite broken down by woe, 
I've lost my wife and cannot find her anywhere I 
go ; 
At first she robbed me of my heart and now she's flown 
from me, 
And taken all my furniture, wherever can she be ? 
CHORUS. 
Perhaps she's on the railway, with a 
swell so fair,— 
Perhaps she's up in a 
balloon. flying thro' the air; 
Perhaps she's dead, perhaps alive. perhaps she's on the sea ; 
Perhaps she's gone to Brigham Young, a 
Mormonite to be. 
She read so much of Mormonites, of nothing else she'd 
talk, 
And with a 
sanctified young chap each day she used to 
walk; 
She said he was a 
Mormon saint from f
.ar across the sea.

have not seen her for a 
week, wherever can she be? 
Perhaps she's, & c. 
She can't respect the marriage vows, that faithfully she 
swore. 
I 
only hope her Mormon spouse has fifty wives or more ; 
I 
hope he'll thrash her every night when he comes home 
to tea, 
I 
hope they'll always row and fight wherever they may be. 
Perhaps she's, &c. 
I 
hope she'll have a 
lot of hungry, squalling brats to keep. 
I 
hope they'll cry all night, and never let her go to sleep 7 
hope her chimneys all may smoke, her lodgers never pay 
And German bands and organ men annoy her all the day , 
Perhaps she's, &c. 
If she is in the railway train, I 
hope that it will smash ; 
It up in a 
balloon, I 
hope she'll fall out with a 
crash ; 
If on the road to Salt Lake, then, I 
hope she may gl 
drowned, 
Then I 
will get another wife and quickly 
be bound. 
Perhaps she's, & c.

Written by Pint. II. 2I0WHEY. 
0 white folks jist listen now, 
And a 
story I 
will tell ; 
It's ail about a 
hansom gal, 
In New York she did dwell. 
Her moder she sold apples, 
On de ,Union Ferry Boats; 
Her fader made a 
fortune 
In cleaning up old coats. 
CHORUS. 
But she's gone far away, 
I 
ne'er shall see her more 
She's ran oft' wid a 
tin- ware 
To Jersey's foreign shore. 
My gal she vendered hot-corn, 
And dat too in good style; 
And her melodious tenor-voice could 
Be heard for half a 
mile. 
Ehe met dis hansom tin- ware man, 
(E wish he'd ne'er been born ;) 
He stopped and asked my gal to give him 
Three cents worth of corn. 
But she's gone, Sce. 
Dey walked and talked togeder, 
For a 
couple ob hours or more; 
When he asked her if she'd fly wid him 
To Jersey's foreign shore. 
And from his pocket forth he pulled 
A bottle full of gin ; 
Dia settled it— so off she ran 
Wid dis man dat peddled tin. 
But she's gone, itc 
I's guanto get a 
mus-ku-et, 
A keg ob powder too ; 
A great big knife and pis-tu-el, 
And hunt New Jersey through. 
And it I 
find dat tin- ware man, 
He'll peddle tin no more ; 
But start anoder grave- yard, 
On New Jersey's foreign shore.

ALL THAT GLITTERS IS NOT GOLD. 
in this world of care and troub'.e, 
Where men toil with hand and brain; 
Seeking fame— that airy bubble._ 
And not always seek in vain. 
Though the path be strew'd 
Eh flowers, 
And the laurels bind his brow, 
All his friends admire his powers,

Still he's wasted, worn and weary, 
And he finds he's growing old; 
remember thou the sage's adage— 
" 
All that glitters is not gold." 
See the warrior, brave in action, 
Ever ready for the fray! 
Sternly, nobly, seems all faction, 
And to freed ) tri fights his way. 
How he bears with cold and hunger, 
Houseless, homeless, 'Death the sky, 
He must march a 
little longer, 
Till he hears the battle cry. 
Then his soul is fill rd with glory, 
Tho' his friends lie stark and cold, 
Thus ends many a 
hero's story— 
" 
All that glitters is not gold." 
See that great and mighty noble, 
Rolling in his coach of state, 
Surely he has ne'er known trouble, 
his seems such a 
happy fate; 
He has heaps of land and money, 
Lovely N‘ ife and children fair, 
What a

Surely he has not a

PARODY ON " YOU'LL REMEMBER ME. 
0, listen to a 
story sad. 
About a 
girl named May, 
My peace of mind was ne'er disturbed, 
Till a 
chap popped in the way. 
For she was as lovely as the moon, 
And lived at Tennessee; 
And I 
always thought, upon my life, 
That she'd remember me! 
That she'd remember me! 
One lovely night, when the stars shone brig,ht, 
Towards her house I 
strolled, 
When in the parlor there I 
saw 
A chap a 
setting bold. 
Into the room then I 
rushed, 
With rage could scarcely see, 
And as I 
punched him on the nose, I 
said, 
Now you'll remember me ! 
Now you'll remember me. 
He called, " Police !" the bobbies came; 
He told them what I 
had done, 
And then before the magistrate 
Of course I 
had to come. 
The judge, with one eye upon his book, 
From me he would take no fee; 
And as he sentenced me six months, he said, 
Now youll remember me I 
Now you'll remember me I

THE FINE OLD IRISH: GENTLEMAN. 
I'll sing you a 
dacent song that was made by a 
Paddy's pate, 
Of a 
raal ould Irish gintleman, who had a 
tine estate, 
Whose mansion it was mad,' of mud, with thatch and all complate 
\lith a 
hole at the top, through which the smoke so gracefully 
did retrate, 
Harrah for the ould Irish gintleman, the boy of the oulden time 
us walls so cold, were cover'd wid the devil a 
thing for show, 
Except an ould shilkdah, which had knocked down many a 
foe, 
And there ould Barney sat at ease, without shoes or hose, 
And quaft'ed his noggin of potteen to warm his big red nose, 
Like a 
fine ould Irish gintlemsn, the boy of the oulden time. 
To Donnybrook his custom was to go to every fair, 
And though he'd seen a 
few score years, he still was young when 
there, 
And while the rich they feasted him, he still among the poor, 
"Would sing, and dance, and hurl and fight, and make the spal. 
peens roar, 
Like a 
raal ould Irish gintleman, the boy of the oulden time. _. 
But och mavrone! once at a 
row ould Barney got a 
knock, 
And one that kilt him, 'cause he couldn't get o'er the shock; 
They laid him out so beautiful, and then set up a 
groan, 
Och! Barney, darlint, jewel dear, why did you die? och, hone 
Then they waked this Irish gintleman, the boy of the oulden timA. 
U 
things in their course must change, and seasons paes 
Yet Irish hearts of oulden time were just as at this day.

boy, he took a 
nride to Drove himself a

BATHING. 
One quiet afternoon in the latter part of June, 
My employer said, "James, I'll dispense with 
Your service, from to-day, for a 
fortnight go away; 
Here's a ' fifty' for defraying the expense with. 
How nice it is to go, just for aweek or so., 
From town to ease the mind from toil and slaving; 
Along the hills to scramble, and in the waters gambol, 
To enjoy a 
little clean and wholesome bathing. 
I 
was a 
single man, and my sweetheart, Mary Ann, 
In the country lived ( the daughter of a 
farmer); 
So, natural enough, next morning with a 
puff. 
I 
was soon locked in the embrace of my charmer. 
She met at the train, and how can I 
explain 
My eestacy or how I 
was behaving. 
But I, kissing, went away, when I 
heard an old, man say, 
"To cool his love he'd better try some bathing." 
So, nexCmorning I 
arose, and the weather being close, 
Determined on dipping in the river. 
So I 
told the servant maid that I 
going was to bathe, 
And at eight o'oclock I'd be returning thither. 
Two hundred yards I 
swam from the spot where I 
began, 
To an island, when for breath I 
almost craving, 
From the water up arose, turned round to find my clothes, 
But all had disappeared while I 
was bathing. 
I 
shaking was like leaves when I 
saw the nasty thieves, 
I 
shouted out, " You sacrilegious wretches, 
Take my coat, my boots and hat, satin vest and silk cravat 
But for decency do bring me back my breeches. 
But all was no avail, they were off and in full sail, 
Not e'en a 
pair of socks could I 
be saving. 
When, my troubles on to force, in a 
boat a 
gent across 
Pulled two ladies to the spot where I 
was bathing. 
[

BATHING. [CONCLUDED.] 
Oh, judge of my surprise, I 
could scarce believe my eyes, 
When I 
saw that one was Mary, my intended. 
I 
was dumb, I 
had no choice; if I 
spoke she'd know my voie1/
4  
And look a 
thing that ought to be prevented. 
So I 
dodged around the isle, till a 
quarter of a 
mile 
Stood between me and the boat, I 
almost raving. 
When, agreeable to view, and by chance most lucky too, 
I 
saw another individual come bathiug. 
I 
soliloquised, ' Here goes, I 
must have a 
suit of clothes, 
Or they'll raise a 'hue and cry' for Mary's lover; .' 
So in I 
plunged once more, and swam towards the shore, 
And took his, for one good turn deserves another. 
He saw me in the fact. and I 
scarce knew how to act 
To get out of the dilemma I 
was braving. 
So away I 
quickly ran, saying " Catch me if you can," 
But he couldn't in the state that he was bathing. 
Like a 
tiger home I 
tore, kep:i knocking at the door, 
The servant she refusing to admit me. 
While creating these alarms, I 
rushed in Mary'sarms 
In a 
suit of corduroys that didn't fit me. 
I 
very soon explained why I 
had been detained, 
And was laughing, though the theft was most depraving, 
When a 
man wrapt in a 
sheet and with nothing on his feet, 
Caine and asked to see the gent who'd been out bathing. 
Said Mary, " Dear, it's true, that he is wanting you, 
I 
wish I'd known what made you stay away so. 
I 
saw you all the wiiile, you were dodging round the isle; 
But, to tell the truth, I 
didnt like to say so." 
So the stairs I 
stumbled down, while I 
nearly broke my cruwr, 
And apologized for rudely thus behaving. 
But now rob me if you can, for I'm since a 
married man, 
And Mary minds my clothes when I 
go bathing.

But I'll never part from my own swcetheart,

WHEN I 
HEAR NY LOVE KNOCK AT THE DOOR 
I've a 
beau you must know, who it is I'll not tell, 
So don't ask, for you'll get no reply ; 
A dear dashing fellow, altho' not a 
swell, 
For swells I've no fancy, not I, 
lie's a 
true gentleman, and that is a 
rank 
Above titles, which some girls adore; 
Ali, how my heart beats when I 
hear my dear Frank, 
Give his darling rat-a-tat-at at the door. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, how my heart beats. whenever I 
hear, 
His rat-a-tat, tat, tat, tat, rat-a- tat, tat, tat, tat, 
No music's so sweet, with joy my heart beats 
When I 
hear my love knock at the door. 
At a 
pic-nic we met, one bright summer's day. 
A day I 
ne'er shall forget ; 
We stroll'd thro' the woods, and somehow lost our way 
And our hearts, which are not found as yet : 
But I 
think I've found his, I 
know he has mine, 
And of it may he ne'er be bereft, 
After all we've concluded ' tis but an exchange, 
And ' tis said that exchange is no theft. 
Oh, how my heart beats, &c. 
He has not yet proposed, but I 
think he will soon, 
My mirth I've to hide with a 
frown, 
For I 
know the dear fellow has often began, 
And as oft in confusion broke down ; 
He has vow'd to be mine, in fact we both vow'd, 
Each other to love evermore; 
Ah ! where's there a 
girl whose heart beats not fast 
When she hears her love knock at the door. 
Oh, how my heart beats, &c. 
THE HAPPIEST DARKIES OUT. 
We've just arrived in town to-night, 
Our story for to tell, 
We don't care much if we ain't white, 
Our color suits us well ; 
We practice on the heel and toe, 
And then we sing and shout, 
We're always welcome where we go, 
We're the happiest darkies out. 
CHORUS. 
Just watch the movements of the shin 
We kick dull care about, 
And always wear ajolly grin, 
The happiest darkies out. 
When our plantation work is done, 
We go upon a 
spree. 
To have a 
little sport and fun, 
Our hearts chock full of glee; 
Let politicians lave and blow, 
Let everybody shout, 
We care for neither friend nor foe, 
We're the happiest darkieg out. 
Just watch, &c. 
We both support double-breasted heels, 
Which brings us lots of cash, 
We both love ' taters and fried eels, 
And don't go back on hash; 
And thus we pass each night and day, 
Take dull care by the snout, 
And make him scoot some other way, 
From the happiest chitties out. 
Just watch, &c. 
We go to a 
fancy colored ball, 
And dance a 
jig or reel, 
We fascinate the wenches all, 
By the movement of the heel. • 
They think we are aristocrats 
From Fifth Avenue no doubt— 
"But no," we cry, " that's all my eye," 
We're the happiest darkies out. 
Just watch, &e.

My poor heart is sad with its dreaming, 
it brings back the once happy day, 
When earth like a 
heaven was seeming, 
But now it has passed all away; 
They say that young love's like the flower, 
That needs tender care in its urn, 
But mine it was snateh'd from its bow, 
And I 
never gain'd one in return, 
CHORUS. 
My poor heart is sad with its dreaming, 
For it brings back the once happy day, 
When earth like a 
heaven was seeming, 
But now it has all pass'd away. 
My sad heart recalls all the pleasure, 
Of thoughts that were all, all for thee, 
When dreaming of you of its treasure, 
And you seem'd to love none but me; 
Tho' we meet not as friends, yet I'll never, 
One unkind word to thee give, 
For your cherish'd memory ever, 
Shall be my sole joy while I 
live. 
My poor heart, cie.

Oh I 
where's Rosanna gone. 
I'm sure no other maid 
Could equal my Rosanna, 
Without my love this manly form 
Will soon become a 
wreck; 
Of her Dad I 
was afraid, 
He's a 
disagreeable tanner, 
And lie's often promised faithfully 
He'd dislocate my neck. 
So I 
used to kiss Rosanna just behind the kitchen door.

And she'll ne'er pinch my funny-bone, until it's rather sore,

THE KISS BEHIND THE DOOR.—[CONCLUDED. 
Of an evening after tea, 
While her Daddy blew his `bacca,' 
I'd seek my love Rosanna, and 
Ask her to share my lot. 
But when he found it out, 
Oh my! how he would whack her, 
While I'd jump over the garden wall, 
As tho' I'd just been shot. 
I 
shall never kiss my love, dm 
I'd jumped over the wall one night, 
In search of sweet Rosanna, 
And tho' I 
gently whistled, 
My love did not appear; 
But my hair stood bolt upright, 
For out came her dad the tanner, 
Oh I 
my teeth they rattled like dominoes, 
And my legs doubled up with fear. 
Spoken—At the end, of our interview I 
felt convinced that he 
understood what 'tanning' was, and so did I. 
I 
also concluded.. 
I 
should never see my love, dLe. 
Some say she's hid away, 
By her cruel Dad on purpose, 
To cure her of her love for me. 
Some say my love's no more. 
If she's defunct, then soon 
Shall they find my clay cold corpus, 
And our ghosts shall come and frighten her Dad 
Behind the kitchen door. 
So I 
used to kiss Rosanna just behind the kitchen door, 
But I 
ne'er shall squeedge my darling's little finger any more 
And she'll ne'er pinch my funny-bone, until it's rather sore,

-DARLING MARY JANE. 
White folks I'll sing a 
song, it's neither old or new, 
But while I 
pick the Banjo strings I'll bawl it out to you, 
Its all about and just because I 
love, but all in vain, 
A 
gal that weighed three hundred pounds and her name was 
Mary Jane. 
She was as handsome as a 
hollyhock, her beauty I'll expose, 
She had onion eyes, and carroty hair and a 
lovely, turn up 
nose, 
Which had a 
gumbile on the end, it looked in shape and form 
Like a 
strawberry struck with lightning just after a 
thunder 
storm, 
Her hair it was a 
lovely red, you couldn't help admire, 
When she got mad it rose right up just like a 
blaze of fire, 
She dressed it in the latest style, the waterfall it's called, 
She wears it on the top of her head to cover a 
place „that's 
bald. 
I 
would not care not half so much now if my love was slain, 
By any other feminine except my Mary Jane; 
But if ever I 
catch the clam soup man I'll bounce him like a 
ball, 
i'll pin his ears to the back of his neck and swallow him boots 
, 
and all.

HAPPY UNCLE JOHN 
Oh, good evening, white folks all, we come to make a 
call, 
And tell you how the old man gets on; 
I've come to see you all, both shat, fat, lean and tall, 
While there's dancing left in old Uncle John. 
I 
often have been told that this nigga getting old, 
And soon will be going to the happy land, 
But while I'm on this spot, and I 
the chance have got, 
I'll sing and dance as long as I 
can stand. 
And that's what the old man wants to do. 
Paned 
When I 
was in my prime, I 
had many a 
happy time. 
With the folks way down upon the old plantation, 
And when our days were done, it's then we went in for fun. 
I 
tell you we was a 
happy population. 
My bones are getting sore, I 
cannot work much more, 
And soon to the happy land be gone, 
But while on earth I

There will be dancing left in old Uncle John,

WHERE THE GRASS GROWS GREEN. 
I'm Denny Blake from County Clare, 
And here, at your command, 
To sing a 
song in praise of home, 
And my own native land! 
I've sailed to foreign counteries, 
And in many climes I've been, 
But my heart is still with Erin, 
Where the grass grows green. 
CFIORUS. 
I 
love my native country-, 
And tho' richer land's I've seen. 
Yet I 
can't forget Ould Erin, 
Where the grass grows green. 
Poor Pat is often painted 
With a 
ragged coat and hat; 
His heart and hospitality, 
Has much to do with that. 
Let slanderers say what they will, 
They cannot call him mean; 
Sure, a 
stranger's always welcome 
Where the grass grows green. 
I 
love my, &O. 
He's foolish, but not vicious, 
His faults I 
won't defend; 
His purse to help the orphan, 
His life to serve a 
friend, 
He'll give, without a 
murmur— 
So, his follies try and screen; 
For, there's noble hearts in Erin, 
Where the grass grows green. 
I 
love my, &O. 
'Tis true he has a 
weakness 
For a 
drop of something pure, 
But that's a 
slight debility 
That many more endure. 
He's fond of fun, he's witty, 
Though his wit 'tis not too keen; 
For, there's feeling hearts in Erin, 
Where the grass grows green. 
I 
love my, &O. 
There's not a 
true-born Irishman, 
Wherever be may be, 
But loves the little Emerald 
That sparkles on the sea. 
May the sun of bright prosperity 
Shine peaceful and serene, 
And brill.- 
better days to Erin. 
Where he grass grows green!

For I 
love my, 4c.o. 
THE CIRCUS MASTER. 
Written and Composed by ARTHUR LLOTD. 
In the circus I 
a 
ring-master am, 
Master am, master am ; 
In our corps is a 
beautiful girl, called Nan, 
Who has teen my heart by storm ; 
She is really so graceful 
In face, also in form, 
You'll always find the place full 
When she has to perform. 
CflORUS.—Az round the ring she goes, 
Pointing her lovely toes, 
She is the cause of loud applause 
When she her agility shows. 
She's known to the public as Mademoiselle, 
Mademoiselle C. L. Estelle— 
Her proper name it is Nancy Bell, 
Her mother's is the same; 
The applause tremendous sounds 
As I 
a nounce her name, 
Then in the ring she bounds. 
And my heart it does the same. [As round, &c. 
My heart it goes pit-a-pat, of course, 
With dreadful force, with dreadful force, 
As I 
assist her to mount her horse, 
Then loudly crack my whip. 
All fear I 
know she scorns, 
As she proudly curls her lip, 
Tho' I 
stand as if on thorns, 
In case the darling slip. [As round, &
c. 
After an act she makes a 
pause, 
Makes a 
pause, which always draws 
From the crowded audience loud applause, 
That makes the circus ring 
The clown then cracks his wheezes, 
Or a 
song perhaps he'll sing, 
And says, if the lady pleases, 
He'll some refreshment bring. [As round, &c. 
Altho I offerkl that girl my hand, 
That girl my hand, I 
understand 
She's going to be married to one of the band, 
At ten on Wednesdee. 
I 
wish them both success, and 
She happy ought to be, 
If she's loved by her husband 
As she's adored by me.

WHO WANTS A WIFE AS A PARTNER FOR 
LIFE. 
AIR.—." Thu Mouse Trap Man." 
Who wants a 
wife as a 
partner for life? 
Young men speak out, while the chance you obtain, 
Boldly come forth, and your passion declare, 
Quick you must be, if my hand 'you would gain; 
Never be backward in so good a 
case, 
Mock-modest people we girls always shun; 
Don't be so bashful, my offer embrace, 
For faint heart, you know, never fair lady won, 
CHORUS. 
Young men, young men, take care, 
Speak, speak, you've no time to spare; 
lie that speaks first shall claim me as wife, 
Take me at once as his partner for life. 
On my perfections I've no need to dwell, 
That I'm accomplish'd you all can discern; 
Pay great attention, for now I 
will tell, 
What sort of beau I'd prefer in return: 
lie must be handsome, and he must be fair, 
Quiet an Adonis in figure and face ; 
Eyes azure blue, and have rich auburn hair, 
With whiskers to match, trimned with exquisite grace 
Young men, & c. 
Out by himself he, of course, must not roam, 
(Wives who allow such are certainly wrong), 
lie must content himself stayinf.ar 
at home, 
Hand and foot wait on me all the day long; 
If to avoid having ‘• family j 
rs" 
He is desirous, there's one thing quite clear, 
lie must abstain from his pipes and cigars, 
Giving up drinking " Cooper." likewise" bitter beer." 
Young men, & c. 
Still no reply ! what alas shall I 
do ? 
Fair men to speak out are not in the mind, 
They've lost a 
chance which 
never renew, 
I'll wed a 
dark man should he be inclin'd; 
All the fair men in my eye appear small, 
Ev'ry one here I 
have put to the test, 
That dark man wink'd (
points) so I 
think after all 
'Tween fair men and dark men, the dark are the best. 
-Young men, & e. 
Ant—" The Bed, White and Blue." 
Some like red herrings fresh from the ocean, 
Others doat on a 
bit of pigs-try, 
Some like ox-cheek I've a 
notion, 
Others live upon puddings and pie. 
In the soup-slkops thousands assemble, 
And feed off a 
soup made of glue, 
But to me there's nothing resembles, 
A rule ould Irish stew. 
CHORUS. 
So good luck to an Trish stew, 
Three cheers for an Irish stew, 
To me there's nothing resembles, 
A. rule ould Irish stew 
When the tater blight spread desolation, 
And threatened the stew to deform, 
Old Nick too threatened the nation, 
But he couldn't ride through the storm. 
For our soldiers and sailors already, 
To blazes his strong forts have blew 
For the thing to keep good man ready 
Is a 
good mess of Irish stew. 
So good luck to an Irish stew, 
Long life to an Irish stew, 
For a 
mess for all tars in all weathers 
is a 
good ould Irish stew. 
Then the stew. boys, the stew, boys, bring hither, 
And feast till you're up to the brim, 
May the stew of St. Patrick ne'er wither, 
Nor the name of a 
Murphy grow dim ; 
May the spud and the union ne'er sever, 
When with good meat its brought up to view, 
May the nation and the people get ever, 
A good ould Irish stew. 
Then three cheers for an Irish stew, 
Good luck to an Irish stew, 
May the Army and Navy get ever 
A rule ould Irish slew. 
THERE'S BOUND TO BE A ROW. 
I'm a poor, 
un - luck - y mar - ried man, I've

all 
I 
can, 
But

Bound to

She makes me do the household work. 
When I 
come home at night; 
If I 
cough or sneeze when going to bed, 
Of course that is not right. 
If she should wake the young ones up, 
With rage she'll storm I 
vow, 
And if I 
snore too hard for her, 
Why there's bound to be a 
row. 
Cho.—There's bounds d;e. 
She wakes me every morning, 
In an awful cruel way, 
She kicks me round about the room, 
Yet not a 
sentence dare I 
say; 
I 
have to wash my stockings, 
My fronts and shirts, I 
vow, 
And if I 
don't wash for her as well 
There's bound to be a 
row. 
Cho.—There's bound, &e. 
And when I'm paid my wages, 
After working hard all week, 
I 
give her every farthing up, 
And then she's got the cheek 
To give me two pence for myself, 
And for that I 
have to bow, 
But if I 
spend it all at once 
There's bound to be a 
row. 
Cho.—There's bound, loa. 
When we had neither girl nor boy, 
She cast on me the blame; 
Now that we've five little ones, 
She grumbles just the same; 
But I 
no longer must be stopping, 
So at once I'll make my bow, 
For if my old woman should but pop in, 
There's bound to be a 
row. 
Cho.—There's bound, dce.

THE MASTER OF THE CEREMONIES. 
Kind friends, please excuse my imperfections 
At present I 
don't feel myself; 
I've been robb'd of all my affections 
By a 
cruel, bewitching young elf, 
I 
never thought she would have done it, 
For she seetu'd so partial to pie— 
My heart, at that ball, she had won it, 
When I 
was installed the 31. C. 
CHORUS. 
Her form is still before me, 
Wherever 1 
may be; 
That lovely charmer at the ball, "\ 
in which I 
was M. C. 
Her black eyes seemed on me to linger, 
I 
picked up a 
glove she let fall; 
She took it, and just squeezed my finger! 
0 ! why did I 
go to that ball ? 
Her sweet. 
voice bewildered my senses, 
Like a 
post I 
often stood still; 
For a 
Waltz I. shouted out Lancers, 
And the Polka I 
called a 
Quadrille. 
Her form, & c. 
I 
sat by the side of my charmer, 
And thought her the nicest of girls ; 
Then vowed that no one should harm her, 
As I 
played with her bright auburn curls. 
I 
thought what a 
beauty I'd captured, 
As close to my side she did cling; 
With love I 
felt so enraptured, 
That I 
gave to her my diamond ring, 
Her form, ex. 
I 
asked if I 
might have the pleasure 
To see her safe home through the rain ; 
She consented—and called me her treasure 
1 
kissed her again and again 
When a 
fellow standing behind me, 
Growled, redress he would have or my life ; 
And swore to powder he'd grind me 
For my making love to his wife. [Her form, Sze. 
In anger and doubt I 
gazed on her 
Begged of her to explain the ease, 
I 
appealed to her love awl her honor: 
0

I 
never thought she'd have done it 
For she seemed so partial to me,

When they blew up the Cashmere gate.

And lion-hearted fought officers and men, 
Blood for blood, was our country's cry,

THE OLD BROWN COT. 
Among the scenes to memory dear, 
To which my fancy oft returns 
And for those long-lost days of joy 
My spirit in its sadness yearns 
There's none which seems So dear to me 
As

There's none for which I

The moss-grown cot beneath the hill; 
Though years have passed since I 
was there,

It stood beside the running brook, 
Whose waters turned the noisy mill. 
And close beside the tall old oaks, 
That nodded on the sloping hill. 
The woodbine creeping o'er the walls, 
The sunshine on the grassy plot ; 
How beautiful were they to me, 
When home was in that old brown cot! 
The old brown cot, dIrc. 
.`hough I 
may view the fairest land, 
On which the sun in glory beams; 
And dwell in climes more beautiful 
Than poets visit in their dreams, 
Still with affection linger round 
That loved and consecrated spot; 
And tears will fall as I

We walked and talked together, 
Until it was quite late, 
And bidding her a

And your name shall be dear to the true and the brave. 
CHORUS. 
Give me the Spade, &c. 
Give me the Spade—the American's glory— 
That fashions the field from the bleak barren moor, 
Let us speak of its praise in ballad and story, 
While 'tis brightened with labor, not tarnished with 
gore. 
It was not the Sword that won our best battles, 
Create I 
our Commerce, extended our Trade, 
Gave food for our wives, our children, our cattle, 
But the Queen of all weapons—the Spade, boys, the 
Spade. 
Give me the Spade, &c. 
Give me the Spade, there's a 
magic about it, 
That turns the black soil into bright shining gold, 
What would our fathers have done, boys, without, 
When this land lay all bare and the north wind blew 
cold. 
Where the tall forests stood, and the wild beasts were yell-
ing., 
Where out stout-hearted ancestors shrank back afraid— 
Now the cornstack is raised and have cleared a 
dwelling, 
Then Hurrah for our true friend, the Spade, boys, the 
Spade. 
Give me the Spade, &c. 
GO 
THE RISING GENERATION 
Go where you will, you'll get your fill of modern airs and 
graces— 
Our little boys desert their toys to put on manly faces— 
With dyed moustache they cut a 
dash, go in for dissipation ; 
With quizzing glass they eye each lass, this Rising Generation. 
When not sixteen they're often seen upon some midnight frolic. 
They wink their eye and wiggle by, like a 
lobster with th. 
colic; 
Oft in a 
fight at dead of night they're draggged off to the 
station, 
Papa will pay the fine next day for this Rising Generation. 
Their ma's we'd thank if they would spank those naughty little 
friskers, 
Or take the dears and box their ears, or pull their little 
whiskers. 
But no, they say, our boys are gay, a 
pattern for the nation ; 
They are our pride so let them slide, this Rising Generation. 
And then the girls with flowing curls raised on the head of 
others, 
Each one a 
belle who cuts a 
swell, outrages like the brothers; 
They flirt their fans like warming pans for public approbation 
Dressed out like dolls with waterCalls, this Iti.sing Generation. 
And then the pets wear fishing nets, with which to catch some 
sculping; 
They make you treat for all they eat, for they are fond of 
gulping. 
Ice cream, strawberries', peaches, cherries, they eat a 
hearty 
ration, 
And they don't go back on their apple jack, this Rising Gene 
ration..
