We're glad to sing of something new, 
-With hearts full of devotion; 
We'd traveled nearly o'er this world, 
O'er land, o'er sea and ocean. 
We're of a 
great dear family, 
Of Irish hearts the purest; 
Our title name is one of fame, 
We're called the Irish Tourists, 
CHORUS. 
There's the flag that showed the tourists on the wave, 
'Tis the flag that make our home so brave; 
'Tis the flag that over us shall wave, 
'Tis the stars and stripes of America. 
Now German music sounds so sweet 
Upon that far-off shore; 
There's music ringing, birds are singing 
You'd never wish for more. 
There's Sweitzer kase and nude! soup, 
Now Germans make the purest; 
Limburger sweet and beer to treat, 
Enjoyed by the Irish Tourists. 
There's the flag, etc. 
There's one bright spot we dearly love--
The little place eilled Ireland; 
There's a 
home of honest Irish hearts 
That dwells down in the mireland; 
Ther's n 
little place that's no disgrace,

She said that she was fond of birds, and liked a

And took her little hand in mine and gave it a

.-TB.E OLD RUSTIC BACK CHAIR. 
wrv*..n by HARRY S. 
MILLER of Philadelphia, and sung by Fatics 
HARRIS. 
AIR.—" The Mulberry Tree." 
Who is there among us who has not at home 
Some picture or token most dear, 
In mein , ry of loved ones to a 
brighter world flown 
Where sorrow doth never appear? 
Some treasure a 
locket, or a 
cradle so sweet, 
But what I 
hold firmly with care 
Is not a 
blue violet nor green ivy leaf, 
(Repeat three times) 
But a 
darling old rustic back chair. 
CHORUS. 
For I 
love that old rustic back chair, 
lye guarded so long now with care, 
The years may pass by, but still I 
will try 
To treasure that rustic back chair. 
Well i 
remember those bright happy days, 
The golden sunshine of my youth, 
Nor have I 
forgotten my mother's kind ways, 
As she taught me to speak but the truth. 
And in that old chair in childhood I've slept, 
While a 
kind mother watching me there, 
how can I 
refrain or ever forget 
(Repeat three times)- 
Tim t 
darling old rustic back chair. 
For I 
love that old, etc. 
Oft in that chair when when but a 
small child 
My mother had nursed me to sleep; 
And when I 
awoke her face lit with a 
smile, 
That meant more than her words could speak. 
But now she has gone to that bright world above, 
That's free from all sorrow and care, 
I 
shall never again see the one I 
did love 
(R.Trat three times) 
In that darling old rustic back chair. 
For I 
love that old, etc. 
As the years they roll on I 
still cherish in heart, 
And guard with the greatest of pride, 
While life does remain I 
never shall part 
With the chair in which my mother died. 
Of all the mementoes none this chair can replace, 
For once a 
kind mother sat there; 
While never again will I 
see that dear face 
(Repeat three times) 
In that old rustic back chair. 
For I 
love that old, etc.

SItAde copyrighted and Published by Wm. H . 
KENNEDY, Brooklyn 
E. D. Price 40 cents. 
Little empty cradle, treasured now with care, 
Though thy precious burden it has fled. 
how we miss the locks of curly golden hair, 
Peeping from thy tiny snow-white bed, 
When the dimpled cheeks and little laughing eyes 
Front the rumpled pillow shone, 
Then I 
gazed with gladness, now I 
look and sigh 
Empty is the cradle, Baby's gone. 
Cnonus. 
Baby left her cradle for the golden shore, 
O'er the silv'ry waters she has flown, 
Gone to join the angels peaceful ever more.; 
Empty is the cradle, Baby's gone. 
Near a 
shady valley stands a 
grassy mound, 
Underneath my little darling sleeps. 
Blossoms sweet, and roses cluster all around i 
Over head the willow silent weeps. 
There I 
laid my loved one in the long ago, 
And my heart doth sadly moan, 
Though she's with the angels, still I 
fain would weep; 
Empty is the cradle, Baby's gone. 
Baby left her cradle, etc. 
OH, FRED! TELL THEM TO STOP. 
As sung by Coot, Bunasss. 
No doubt you have heard of the great fancy fair, 
That used to take place every day; 
-Well, I 
thought for amusement I'd take my girl there, 
To pass a 
dull hour away. 
We went in you must know and saw Barnum's Great 
Show. 
Van A 
mburgh's Menagerie as well; 
There were roundabouts, swings and all kind of 
things, 
Forget the day I 
never shall. 
SPOKEN. — Yes, when we got to the fair my girt 
wanted to have a 
ride on one of the swings. 
I 
said: 
"All right., my darling," and we had a 
swing; but 
directly the swing went to and fro, she lustily called 
out: 
CHORUS. 
Oh, Fred! tell them to stop! 
That was the cry of Maria; 
But the more she said whoa! they said let it go, 
And the swing went a 
little bit higher. 
The people that stood round, of course they all laughed 
But I 
only said stop the swing; 
There were four or five others in the boats beside us, 
Saying, master, don't do such a 
thing. 
'Twits then that some roughs caught hold of the ropes, 
Maria fell down on her knee, 
And one of them said, the young man's turning red, 
But isn't he having a 
spree. 
Oh, Frbd! eta. 
They soon stopped the swing and Maria got out, 
And quickly fell down on the floor; 
They brought her some water, which soon brought 
her to, 
This girl whom I 
now do adore. 
Should you ever go there to the great fancy fair, 
Friends, take advice while I 
sing, 
Of the great roundabout, it's the best fun that's out, 
And finish the day with a 
swing. 
SPOKEN. — Mark now, before you get into the 
swing's boat, make a 
bargain with your young lady 
not to call outt 
Oh, Fred! sta.

A TRAMP. 
(A RECITATION.) 
As reetted by CHARLES BURKE, of CAMPBELL & BURKE. with great 
success. 
Lemme sii; down a 
minute, a 
stone's got in my shoe; 
Don- t 
you commeace your cussin', I 
ain't done nothite 
to you. 
Yes, I'm a 
tramp. 
What of it? 
Folks say we - ain't 
no good, 
kBut tramps has to live, I 
reckon, though folks don't 
think we should. 
Once I 
was strong and handsome, had plenty of cash 
and clothes, 
That was afore I 
tippled and gin got into my nose 
Down in Lehigh Valley me and people grew, 
I 
was a 
blacksmith, cap'ep—yes, and a 
good one, too; 
Me and my wife and Nellie— Nellie was just sixteen, 
She was the pootiest creature the Valley had ever seen, 
Beaux? Why she had a 
dozen—had 'em from near 
and fur, 
But they were nioAly farmers, Clone of 'em suited her. 
There was a 
city stranger, young, handsome and tall, 
Damn him—I 
wish I 
lad him strangled at.;in that wall. 
He was the man for Nellie— she dAn't know no ill; 
Mother, she tried to stop it, but yo:, know a 
young 
gal's will. 
Well, it's the saute old story— common enough, you'd 
say, 
He was a.soft-tongued devil, and got her to run away 
More than a month after we heard from the p 
00 
young thing, 
He'd gone away and left her without a wedding rin:i 
Back to her home we brought her, back to her mot!:

FilEd with a 
raging fever— she fell at my feet and died 
rrantic with shame and trouble, her mother began tt

Dead— in less than a

I 
MARY ANN, I'LL 'TELL YOUR MA. 
Written and Composed by GEOFFREY THORN. 
;lung with great success by TONY PASTOR. 
The music of this song is published by E. H. HARDING, 
9 (-wery 
New York. 
Price 10 cents. 
I 
spoon a 
girl named Mary Ann, a 
tender little dove, 
Who costs me lots of half-pence, and a 
precious deal of lovei 
She's living with her mother, as a maiden ought to do, 
And looks as straight and proper as a 
saint, or me or you. 
But somehow when I 
trot her round, no matter where we go, 
I'm struck with all the people that this maiden seems to know! 
ejp, 
For certain as Mary Ann I 
proudly take about, 
A ' 
'
tome heads pop round the corner, and a 
vulgar voice will shott: 
CHORUS. 
Oh, very well, Mary Ann, I'll tell your ma. 
She little thought when you came out you'd go so far, 
Pm sure your mother doesn't know -the girl you are, 
Mary Ann, fie I 
for shame, Yah! yah ! ya.h! Oh! yah! 
We went, last Whitsun Monday to the forest by the rail, 
We did the thing first class of course, at that I 
never fail; 
I 
tipp'd the guard a 
shilling, or what you might call a 
bob, 
To lock us in a 
carriage and preserve us from the mob. 
We sat on downy cushions and the curtains drew for fun, 
For Polly said her pretty eyes they could not bear the sun, 
But when we settled snugly and were just about to go 
A head came through the window and a 
fellow shouted— 
Oh, very well, etc. 
We wander'd through the forest glades as happy as could be, 
We thought from vulgar people there, we should at least be free, 
We sought a 
sweet secluded spot, where none our vows could hear 
And whisper'd those soft, silly things, that lovers think so dear. 
We sat beneath a 
spreading oak, our loving arms entwined, 
While I 
was fond and foolish, she was gentle, sweet and kind; 
But just as I 
my passion told, and sealed it with a 
kiss, 
A 
chap birds-nesting up above, so rudely shouted this— 
Oh, very well, etc. 
We came away disgusted, and we quickly made for home, 
For everywhere we met the cry, no matter where we'd roam, 
My Mary Ann declared to me she knew those people not, 
In fact, she said she would not mix with such a 
vulgar lot. 
But on this precious mystery I 
have some little doubt, 
And almost think that Mary Ann must know her way about, 
For when we parted at her door, or rather just inside, 
A 
voice came down the staircase, and her little brother cried— 
SPOKEN.—Oh 
I 
oh! oh! 
Oh, very well, etc.

ARE YOU GOING PAR? ONLY TO THE CAR. 
Copyright Secured 1881. 
As sung by America's own Vocalist, TONY Pesroa. 
Strolling out the other evening, 
Such a 
fairy girl I 
met, 
Eyes so bright with love- light gleaming, 
Her first glance I'll ne'er forget. 
Softly I 
addressed the maiden— 
In her face iny fate I 
read— 
" 
Tell me, sweet one, whe're you're going," 
•` Just to meet my pa," she said. 
CHOltrs. 
"Are you going far?" " Not too far, 
Only to the ear just to see pa, ta-ta.." 
In a 
pleasant way we chatted, 
I 
asked leave to call next day, 
She of course felt highly flattered 
To be courted in that way. 
To her ma she introduced me, 
Then may way- was smooth and clear, 
There was nothing she refused me, 
When I 
whispered in her ear. 
SPOKEN.--Yes, she was very obliging; she was 
kindness itself; she would do almost anything for 
me. 
Why, one day, as we were passing Delmonico's, 
I 
asked her to come in, and, do you know, she con-
sented without a 
murmur. 
Her mother, too, is a 
real 
nice old lady. 
Whenever 131;n:che and I 
are going 
out for a 
walk, she will say— 
Are you going far, etc. 
But one day we met her lather, 
Then there was an awful row; 
Was he angry? Well, yes, rather, 
Such a 
frown upon his brow; 
" 
Who are you, sir, with my daughter?" 
'rfwas a 
voice like thunder's roar. 
you know me, sir? You'd ought to, 
l'm a 
swell called Theodore.' 
SPOKEN. — It was eptite a task to make an impres-
sion on the old gentleman, but I 
succeeded in 
convincing him that it was perfectly right and proper 
for Blanche and 1 
to say to one another— 
Are you going far, etc.

ARE YOU GOING TO THE MAT' THIS AFF? 
As sung by the great and only CHARLEY KONOLLMAN. 
HUSie published by W HITE, SMITH & Co., No. 5111 Washington Street. 
Boston, Mass. 
Price 3.3 cents. 
There is a 
great sensation, about a 
word you hear 
nowadays, 
The boys and girls all use it, it's about going to the 
Matinees; 
You can hear them say to each otheP, when they are 
going past, 
It's either Charles or Emma, " Are you going to the 
mat this aff?" 
CIIORUS. 
" 
Are you going to the mat this aff?" 
some other air," 
" 
Are you going to the mat this aff?" 
"Then good-aff." 
" 
Are you going to the mat this air?" 
some other aff," 
" 
Are you going to the mat this aff?" 
' 
Then good-aff." 
"Not this air, 
"Not this aff;" 
" 
Not this aff, 
" 
Not this aff;" 
By chance I 
met a 
lady friend, I 
knew for many a 
day, 
I 
went with her a 
walking, and I 
left her on Broad-
way, 
And the time that we were parting, she winked at 
me and laughed, 
And then said " Good-morning, Harry, are you going 
to the mat this aff?" 
"Are you going to the mat, etc. 
When boys are kissing pretty girls, they don't know 
what to say, 
They commence to give them earaches, of new things 
out to day; 
She'll say, " Don't waist your breath talking, we've 
heard the best and last--
The latest of the season is, " Are you going to the 
mat this aff?'" 
Are you going to the mat, etc.

In that fair old land of Scotland far away.

In lands far away she does roam; 
Her promise she will keep, oh, break it not, my Jean, 
We'll be happy in our bonnie little home. 
Oh, then let me not long wait, but meet niai soon,

And heaven will smile upon our love,

As sung by IL G. Lrrn.s. 
I've a 
casket at home that is filled with pretious gems; 
I 
have pictures of friends dear to me, 
And I've trinkets so rare, that came many years ago, 
From my far distant home across the sea. 
But there's one sweet little treasure that I'll ever 
dearly prise, 
Better far than all the wer.lth beneath the wave; 
Tho' a small faded flow'ret, that I 
placed in child 
hooa's days, 
'Tis a 
flower from my angel mothet's grave. 
CHOR 
Treasured in my- mem'ry like a 
happy dream, 
Are the loving words she gave, 
And my heart fondly cleaves to the dry and witherei 
leaves--
'Tis a 
flower from my angel mother's grave. 
In the quiet country churchyard they laid her dowt 
to sleep; 
Close beside the old home she's at rest, 
And the low, sacred mound is enshrined within my 
heart, 
By the sweet ties of love forever olest. 
In the still and silent night I 
often dream of home 
again, 
And the vision ever tells me to be brave; 
'or the last link that binds me to the place I 
love so 
well, 
Is the flower from my angel mother's grave.

And they surely will come down.

By ELLEN FORRESTER, and recited by C. P. HYLAND. 
Remember, Dennis, all I 
bade you say, 
Tell him we're well and happy, thank the Lord; 
But of all our troubles since he went away, 
mind, avick, and never say a 
word. 
Of rare and troubles sure we've had our share, 
The finest sunnuer isn't always fair. 
Tell him the spotted heifer calved in May, 
She died, poor thing, but that you needn't mind, 
:Nor how the constant rain destroyed the hay; 
But tell him God to us was ever kind, 
And when the fever spread the country o'er 
His mercy kept the sickness from our door. 
Be sure you tell him how the neighbors came 
And cut the corn and stored it in the barn; 
"rwould be as well to m..ntion them by name— 
Pat Murphy, Ned McCabe, and James McCam, 
And big Tint Daily, front behind the hill ; 
But say, agra, oh, say, I 
missed hint still. 
They came with ready hands our toil to share, 
"rwa , then 1 
missed him most—my 0w11 right hand. 
I 
felt, although kind hearts were round me there, 
The kindest heart beat in a 
foreign land. 
Strong hand, brave heart, Oil, severed far from me 
By many a 
weary league of shore and sea. 
THE WIDOW'S MESSAGE TO HER S02.

(Conducted.) 
And tell him she was with us—he'll know who— 
Mavourneen, hasn't she the winsome eyes? 
The darkest., deepest, brightest, bonniest blue 
I 
ever saw except in summer skies; 
And such black hair, it is the blackest hair • 
That ever rippled over neck so fair. 
Tell him old Pincher fretted many a 
day, 
And moped, poor dog, ' twas well he didn't die; 
Crouched by the roadside he watched the way, 
And sniffed the travelers as they passed him by; 
Hail, rain, or sunshine, sure ' twas all the same, 
He listened for the foot that never came. 
Tell him the house is lonesome-like and cold, 
The fire itself seems robbed of half its life; ' 
But maybe ' tis my eyes are growing old, 
And things look dim before my failing sight; 
For all that, tell him ' twas myself that spun 
The shirts you bring him, and stitched them, every 
one. 
Give him my blessing morning, noon, and night, 
Tell him my prayers are offered for his good, 
That he may keep his Maker still in sight, 
And firmly stand, as his brave father stood, 
True to his name, his country, and his God, 
Faithful at home and steadfast still abroad.

The light of hope from your bright eyes'dispelied

YOU'LL MISS ME WHEN I'M GONE. 
As Sung by Goss 8c Fox, at the Theatre Cornique. 
I 
am growing old and feeble, 
My hair is turning gray; 
My limbs are weak and painful— 
Are stiff, and won't obey. 
My dancing days are over, 
My pleasures are all gone; 
For goodness, not for greatness, 
You'll miss me when I'm gone. 
CHORUS. 
When I'm gone, you will miss me; 
When I'm gone, you will miss me; 
There is one kind heart will: miss me, when I'm gone. 
When I'm gone, you will miss me; 
When I'm gone, you will miss me; 
There is one kind heart will miss me, when I'm gom

When winter time comes on? 
Who'll fold their arms about you,

Who'll hug you, and caress you,

You'll know where you can find me, 
But yoit'll miss me when Pm gone.

There's a 
little girl that charms 
The world as well as me, 
With her eyes of blue, so sweet and true, 
And heart so free; 
Many hours, and the flowers, 
Do I 
pass with her; 
Sallie Horner, round the corner, 
Little one so dear. 
CHORUS. 
Now I 
wonder, as I 
ponder, 
If she's true to me? 
If I'm any, of the many— 
Will she constant be? 
None completer, none is sweeter 
In this world of ours; 
Sallie Horner, round the corner, 
In her home of flowers. 
You'll discover how to love her 
If you only try; 
You'll be given gleams of heaven 
If you catch her eye; 
Like the stars that gleam and glisten 
In the azure sky, 
When she speaks the angels listen 
As they pass her by. 
Now I 
wonder, etc. 
She is very sly and merry 
In her rogueish way; 
I 
adore her more and inora 
In all my love- lit days; 
Always suing, fondly wooing 
For her heart's divine; 
Sallie Homer, round the corner, 
Oh, she must be mine.

"OH, FRED, DON'T BE SO FRIVOLOUS." 
As sung with great success by TONY PASTOR. 
I've courted no end of young ladies, 
Sweet little roses and posies, 
Ladies with sweet, pretty faces. 
And ladies with very long noses; 
The rarest of rare, and the fairest of fair, 
When I 
ask for a sweet little kiss, 
With a 
wink of their eye, and a 
wink on the sly 
The answer they're giving is this, oh, my! 
CHORUS. 
Oh, Fred, don't be so frivolous, 
Oh, Fred, don't be ridiculous! 
rou're not like a 
silly, you know what things are, 
I'll see you to-morrow, tra-la-la, ta-ta. 
Girls are in general quite pettish, 
Some are called miss and some missus; 
The best of them all are coquettish, 
The whole jolly lot's fond of kisses. 
I 
kiss pretty lips and I 
squeeze finger tips, 
No matter what I 
have to pay; 
If I 
meet a 
dear maid who is somewhat afraid, 
She'll blush like a 
rose and will say, oh, my! 
Oh, Fred, etc. 
I 
once knew a 
girl— such a 
sweet one--
She never was saucy nor pert; 
She then was an innocent maiden, 
But now she's a 
saucy little flirt; 
We met Vother night, I 
was very nem tight, 
Her mother was out of the way; 
I gave her a kiss that was brimming', with bliss, 
Tho' she liked it she to me did say, oh, my!

Bringing recollections of bygone happy days,

roam; 
No one's left to cheer me now within that good old 
home. 
Father and mother they have passed away, 
Sister and brother now lay beneath the clay; 
But while life does remain to cheer me I'll retain 
This small violet I 
plucked from mother's grave. 
Only a 
violet I 
plucked when but a 
boy, 
And oftthnes when I'm sad at heart, this flow'r has 
giv'n me joy; 
But while life does remain, in memoriam Fit retain 
This small violet I

Well I

As she used to greet me when I 
returned from toil; 
Always knitting in the old arm chair. 
Father used to sit and read for all us children there. 
But now all is silent around the good old home; 
They all have left me in SO tIOW here to roam; 
While life does remain, in memoriam I'll retain

All on account of Eliza.

DON'T CALL IN THE MORNING. 
written, composed and sung by E. C. DUNBAR. 
Music published by E. H. HARDING, 2.
29 Bowery, New York. 
"rwas at an evening party where I 
first met 14illy Green, 
And thought she was the sweetest girl that I 
had ever seen; 
I 
sought an introduction which I 
happily did obtain, 
a And in nearly all the dances I 
her little hand did gain. 
P4, And when the time for breaking up the party did arrive, 
'(_) see this little damsel home somehow I 
did contrive; 
'at ere we parted at the door I 
boldly asked if I 
I 
Alight call and see her sometime when she gave me this reply-. 
CHORUS. 
Don't come in the morning, for that will he too soon. 
And never call to see me in the afternoon; 
Don't oine in the evening and never call at night, 
But call at any other time and then you'll be all right. 
So strange an answer really I 
could not make out at all, 
Unless it was a 
gentle hint that I 
must never call; 
And yet I 
did not think she could treat me so unkind, 
For somehow she to favor me appeared to be inclined. 
So once again I 
asked her, but the answer was the same; 
And at that very moment to the door the Fervant came. 
Good-night, she said and vanished, did this darling little dear, 
And kept me standing with an an3wer ringing in my ear: 
Don't come in the morning, eta. 
I 
strolled along and wandered v. liar the diclf€,
- could she mean 
As all night long 
dreamt about that; darling little queen; 
P116manic her a 
ns,ver came to me. which seemed to be absurd; 
hut in the morning vhen I 
woke a 
happy- thought occurred. 
She se.id. if I 
would call at any time I 
should be all right, 
117:feept the morning, afternoon, the evening or at night; 
Any time that I 
could call was neither late nor soon; 
Of course you all have guessed by HOW she never more will 
say: 
Don't come in the nionui.ur, ,?

EMPTY IS THE DOG-HOUSE, TOWSBR'S POI-
SONED. 
Sung by Woonsox & ALLEN'S MillSteelS. 
Once I 
had a yellow dog, his name was Towser Jen-
kins, 
A 
butcher cut his tail off with his cleaver; 
Towser had his trade-mar k 
on every cat in town, 
And when he tackled one he'd never leave ' er. 
His nose was full of blisters, where the cats chewed 
off his whiskers, 
But empty is the dog-house where we ties him, 
A 
policeman spotted Towser, put some arsenic in 
grub, 
Empty is the dog-house, Towser's p'isoned. 
CHORUS. 
He's gone to hunt for rats in the happy hunting-
ground, 
lie died this morning as the sun was risin'; 
The fleas have all turned out for to find a 
new lunch 
route, 
Empty is the dog-house, Towser's p'isoned. 
How 
that dog would grin when he would see a 
tramp, 
Ile used to put bay- windows in their breeches; 
His legs were worn off stumpy, chasing milk carts 
round the country, 
He had bunions on his knees from jumpin' ditches. 
He'd corns upon his ribs chashr' rats around corn-
cribs. 
And when he'd catch 'em how he'd paralyze ' cm; 
But he got up and dusted when his chest- protector 
busted, 
Empty is the dog-house, Towser's p'isoned. 
CHORUS. 
lie's gone to hunt for liver, way up the S,,vatiey 
River, 
11 is muzzle ana his collar are in pawn; 
Thr. p'ison made him sad, and he eat his liver-pad, 
Empty is the dog-house, Towser's p'isoned. •

When you settle down in life, 
find some girl to be

You'll find it very handy, I

On a

bright, 
You can then sit in your old arm-

And how they tittered, etc. 
What my brother said was true, for in a 
year or 
Strange to say, I 
settled down in married life; 
I 
first a 
girl did court, and then the ring I 
bought, 
Took her to church and then she was my wife; 
The old girl and me, were as happy as could be, 
For when my work was over I 
declare, 
ne'er abroad would roam, bu2t each night would 
stay at home, 
And be seated in my old arm-chair. 
Ahd how they tittered, et.,_ 
One night the chair fell down, when I 
picked it up I 
found, 
The seat had fallen cut upon the floor, 
And there to my surprise, I 
saw before my eyes, 
A 
lot of notes, two thousand pounds or more. 
When my brother heard of this, the fellow I 
confess, 
Went nearly mad with rage and tore his hair, 
But I 
only laughed at him, then said unto him, 
"Jem, don't you wish you had the old arm- chair?"

DON'T LIKE A CUR AT MY HEELS. 
Words and Music by FRED. BOULARD.

Publishing Co., 32 Beekman Street, New York. 
As sung by NED BARRY, with great succes.s. 
I 
like honest pluck in this warfare uf life, 
No matter whoever I 
meet ; 
I 
like a 
man boldly to say vhat he thinks, 
And not fill me with hollow de(.eit. 
It may not be pleasant at all times to hear 
The truth plainly told in your ear; 
Yet ' tis better 0) know ou're prepar'd for the 
Than tremble like children with tear. 
Clionus. 
i 
do like a 
man that will boldly stand up, 
And tell me at once what he feels, 
I 
can fight with the lion that roars in my face, 
But I 
can't bear a 
cur at my heels. 
(like tf, be told of my faults like a 
man, 
And I 
ne'er knew the man who had none ; 
Hard words may be used, yet I 
like him the most 
Who has pluck all my faults to make known. 
If wrong I 
can cure the foul slander at once, 
Aud destroy every venomous part ; 
Yet I 
reel when a 
Judas, who smiles in my face, 
Gives a 
stab at my back in the dark. 
I 
do like a 
mai, etc 
So behind a 
man's back always mind what you say, 
If you can't do him no good, do him no harm ; 
If you don't like back-biting, don't do it yourself, 
And your good name will spread like a 
charm. 
We all have to live, so let's try and make life 
A 
good open field for the race, 
And if you have cause of complaint ' gainst man, 
Go tell him right straight to his face.

Three little leaves of Irish green,. 
United on one stem; 
On Irish soil are often seen, 
They form a 
magic gem. 
One leaf is' truth, and valor, one, 
The other one is love; 
And these three magic leaves are wet 
By dew-drops from above.

Oh! the shamrock, the shamrock, 
The shamrock immortal and green, 
By ev'ry nook and every brook, 
Grows shamrock so green. 
Oh! do you love, oh say you love, 
The shamrock, emblem of love, 
Oh! say yon love the shamrock so green. 
When Irish soil received the plant, 
The Ellin kings can tell; 
Love, Truth awl Valor wandered there, 
Ana liked the soil so well, 
Each left an emblem in a 
leaf, 
And these together grew, 
Sustained by heaven's warmest beams, 
And nurtured by the dew. 
Oh! the shamrock, etc. 
To thee I 
give the triple leaf, 
As emblem of my love;

Max not unwelcome prove. 
A 
flower of more pretentious worth, 
Could not more plainly tell 
The triple faith I 
have in thee, 
Thou shamrock of the dell. 
Oh! the shamrock, etc.

Come down and open the Coor.

But now, doomed to roani without friends or home, 
And no one to take pity on me." 
The, old man was deaf to her cries, 
Not a 
sound of her voice reached his ear, 
But the watch- dog howled and the village bell toiled. 
And tit9 wind blew across the wild Tr oor. 
Rut how must the old man have felk, 
When he came to the door in the morn. 
Poor Mary was dead, but the child was alive. 
Claely pressed in its dead mother's arms-

Half frantic he tore his gray hair, 
And the tears dewu his cheeks they did poll*?

MANY CAN HELP ONE. 
As sung by A. S. 
TALBOTT. 
Some very good sayings I've heard in my time.. 
And sonic i 
nelieve to be true ; 
The one I 
will mention to night in my song 
Is one that is well known to you ; 
If you meet a 
man 
ho is down in the world, 
And assistance you can't give him any, - 
Rein mber that many can always help one, 
Where ore cannot always help many. 
CHORUS. 
Then give what you can to those in distress, 
Let it be a 
dime or a 
penny, 
For many can help -me, I've heard people say, 
Where one cannoc always help many. 
How often a 
trill: would save a 
man's life 
When he i. near dying from want ; 
tie's tried to live honest all through his lifetime, 
But finds in the end that he can i; 
At last he is tempted to steal or to starve, 
his rich friends they all pass him by, 
They heed not his wishes, they care not his wants, 
lie's left like a 
dog there to die. 
Then give what you can, ett. 
A 
man may be wealthy one end of the year, 
The next one be wretched and poor; 
He's struggled his hardest to keep himself up 
But has sunk down to poverty's door ; 
Such men as these deserve your support, 
So give it to them who most need, 
For those who've e.xperenced poverty know 
'Tis a 
very hard battle indeed. 
Then give what you can, etc 
I 
hope what l've mentioned to-night in my song, 
That nothing I've said out of place ; 
A man may be poor, but still honest be. 
For poverty, ' tis no disgrace ; 
Then give what you can with a 
generous heart, 
No knowing when the tide it may tnrn ; 
tust give him a 
chance to rise up in the world, 
And your kindness he's sure to return. 
Then give what you can,

chere it stands, In the corner, with its back to the watt, 
The oid wooden rocker so stately and tall 
With naught to disturb it but the duster or broom. 
For no one now uses that back parlor room. 
Oh, how well I 
remember in days long gone by, 
When we stood by that rocker, my sister and 1; 
And we listen'd to the stories that our grandma would tell,, 
By that old wooden rocker we all loy'd so well. 
CHORUS. 
As she at by the fire she would rock, rock, rock, 
And we heard but the tick of the old brass clock; 
Eighty years she had sat in that chair grim and tail. 
In that old wooden rocker that stood by the wall. 
If this chair conld but speak, oh, the tales it could telt, 
How poor aged grandpa in fierce battle fell; 
'Neath the stars and the stripes he fought bravely and tru6, 
He cherished his freedom, the red, white and blue. 
It could tell of bright days and of dark ones, beside, 
Of the day when dear grandma stood forth as a 
bride; 
This is why we all love it, this old chair grim and tall, 
The old wooden rocker that stands by the wall. 
As she sat by the tire, ett 
But poor grandma is gone, and her stories are done, 
'Ter children have follow'd her. yes, one by one, 
They have all gone to meet her " in the sweet by-
atlet-eye,R 
And all that i ' eft is dear sister and I. 
Never more will we hide her gold specs or her cap; 
Never more will we tease her while taking her nap; 
'L.-lever more will she slumber in that chair grim % awl tan, 
The old wooden rocker that stood by the wall.

An original and artistic Irish song and dance, the sole property or 
MURPHY AND MORTON. 
As sung by them only, in all the principal theatres of the U. S 
IN 
a 
cosy cottage painted green, 
About three miles from here, 
There lives a 
pretty Irish queen, 
To me she does prove dear; 
Her mother takes in washing, 
And the girl helps to keep up the trade; 
Sunday when I 
go for to see her, 
These words to her I'd say. 
CHORUS. 
MaryAnn McLaughlin, don't you cry, 
Take that apron from your eye ; 
Don't you let the neighbors hear you sigh, 
And we will married be by-and-bye. 
Now soon I'm going to married be, 
Of course I'll settle down ; 
I'll buy a 
house, also a 
farm, 
A 
little way out of town ; 
Oh I 
then it will be joyful, 
When as cosy as a 
mouse; 
To see the yonag 
Playing tag around the house.
