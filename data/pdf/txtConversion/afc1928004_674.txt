THE SUNBURST OF ! FLAW). 
WRITTEN A'ND COMPOSED BY JOHN CUSICK. 
SUNG WITH IMMENSE SUCCESS BY PALLE, & CUSICK. 
When an Irishman leaves the dear land of his birth, 
And he crosses the wild raging sea; 
AL I 
his heart will fly back to the laud that he loves, 
No matter where'er he may be. 
And oft in the wilds of sonic far distant shore, 
That is wafted across on the breeze, 
An image will rise and fill him with sighs, 
For this is the picture he sees. 
CHORUS. 
There's a 
glorious old round tower in Ireland, 
There's the pretty little shamrock so green; 
There's the wolf-dog lying down on the harp 
without a 
crown, 
And the sunburst of Ireland between. 
In the halls of the great, in the cots of the poor. 
There's a 
sight that is always to be seen; 
It's the dear little shamrock we all do adore. 
And long may its memory be green. 
The flag of the stranger may float on our coast, 
But the banner each Irishman bears, 
engraved on his heart with a 
pencil of love, 
r 
or this is the emblem that lie wears: 
Chorus. 
Now long may those tuem'ries remain on each heart, 
As we see the old round tower does stand; 
May the sears of past glory never depart, 
As the sun sheds its rays o'er land. 
May the harp so long silent, arise froin its glooP1 
And ,sound its broad songs as of yore; 
May the green flag of Irtland be once 11:0:.e n 
a 
f!lrb-d. 
And float o'er our own native shore.

MR. AND MRS. DONAGHUE. 
BY JO H V CIISICK. 
SUNG BY PALLAS & CUS/CH. 
Ws well you may stare at the jolly old pair, 
Making their appearance before you; 
But we'll quickly let you know, and that before we go, 
The name we go under is Donaghue. 
Sure we came frum Erin that place where 
There 'tis we are well knowing but for nothing ill. 
At wakes or at weddings, we always are the headings 
And none could equal us at jig or reel. 
CHORUS. 
We're the jolliest old couple that ever the world knew, 
We are neat and gay we can keep it up all day 
And that's what you won't find many old couple do. 
At patern or at fair, we were always the first there, 
Those were the pleasures that gave us fresh delight; 
But some how or other we always got in bother, 
And scarce e'er got out without a 
fight. 
The last fight we had was with big Jimmy Brand, 
He knocked up against us while in a 
jig; 
Begorrow he was sorry he didn't quickly borrow 
Himself away before he felt our twig. 
Chorus. 
Forty years are past away since our wedding day, 
We never had " you lie," between us yet; 
Begorry that's no lie, we live happy her and I. 
Ever since the moment that first we, met. 
Our family it is small, sure we have none at all, 
Neither son or daughter have we got, 
But it's something rare to see an old couple 
like us agree, 
And living so contented with our lot.

While through the streets we were parading, 
Some fellows met us on our way, 
And intended to give us a

Although with them there was about twenty, 
They wouldn't fight, but run away 
From Mike McQuade and Barney McGinty.

From dear Erin's isle;

And if you'll but listen to us for a

To please you our best we will try. 
This song we have raised, and we sing in praise 
Of our heroes in the days of yore, 
Who fought for the freedom of Erin's green isle, 
And the banner our forefather's bore.

The flag that all true Irishmen adore, 
Our life, and our guide, and joy, and our pride 
Is the banner our ferefather's bore. 
Now what about Sarsfield, 
Or Bryan the brave; 
Those heroes were gallant and true, 
They never showed a 
inch of a 
coward or knave. 
But fought as we all ought to do, 
In defence of their country. 
Their bright swords they raised, 
And down on their bended knees, 
Sure they fought for the freedom of Erin's dear isle 
And the banner our forefather's bore. 
Chorus. 
Now where is tne nation compare allthe rest, 
Can equal this island of mine, 
And likewise the heroes who fought when oppressed 
My glory upon them all shine. 
And for our young heros we have now in view, 
May they always prove true to the cause, 
And fight for the freedom of Erin's green isle, 
And the banner our forefather's bore.

Her cheeks are red as any rose,

Down by the old oak tree.

As ever you did see;

Down by the old oak tree. 
I 
never will forget that happy day, 
When first in love I 
fell; 
It was down by a 
little shady brook, 
With a 
pretty country girl. 
It was there I 
first pressed her to my heart, 
Then asked her if she would meet me, 
To-morrow night by the bright moonlight, 
Down by the old oak tree. 
Chorus. 
I 
met this pretty maiden once again, 
The joy, yes, of my life; 
And asked her if she'd name the happy day, 
When she'd become my wife. 
It's then with a 
pretty bashful smile, 
These words she said to me; 
From you I'll never part for you have stole my heart 
Down by the old oak tree.

Can any one tell me, where has she gcne ? 
The first time that I

Of pretty smiling faces, her's was the purest one; 
I was introduced unto her, in fact I 
felt so proud, 
I 
really thought my heart would burst, for I 
exclaimed aloud. 
Chorus. 
We talked of love and poets, and pretty 
wavelet streams, 
told her that by day or night, her image was

She says, pray cease that flattery, no more of it I

In vain I 
tried to kiss her, but she turned 
and fled away.

None can compare with my dear Ethleen;

Kind friends pay attention, and to you we willmenticn 
Some thoughts that of late have come into our minds; 
The first is of Ireland our poor bleeding country, 
To speak of her wrongs now I do feel inclined. 
To praise up her heroes, who ne'er knew what fear was, 
Who fight well in battle, as everyone knows; 
The back bone of England is her Irish army, 
The boys that are reared where the green 
shamrock grows, 
Now where is the nation can equal old Ireland, 
Go search o'er this world you cannot but find; 
That her sons are as brave as the lion in the forest, 
If you meet them in battle they prove they're no, fiat. 
In peace or in war they are full of good humor, 
When called for to fight they are ready to go; 
Now those are the boys that are reared in old Ireland, 
The place where the beautiful shamrock does grow. 
Then many more great men to you I could mention, 
Who die in exile from their dear country; 
I mean those orators who are in English prisons, 
It's when they are dying they let them go free, 
They're forced for to roam into far distant climates, 
To sink or to swim they are bound for to go; 
Now this is the way that our great men are treated, 
That belong to the land whore the green 
shamrock grows.

BARNEY BLAKE THE TAILOR, 
SUNG WITH GREAT SUCCESS BY PALLAS k CUSICK. 
My name is Barney Blake, Pm a 
tareing Irish rake, 
Considered by the neighbors rather handy; 
I 
was brought up in the shade, but I 
learned 
the tailoring trade, 
And I 
think myself as good as John or Sandy. 
I 
work for first-class shops, I 
make clothes for 
swells and fops, 
And I 
am contented with my occupation, 
For I 
love a 
Colleen true, called Bridget Donahue, 
And she is the pride of all the Irish nation. 
CHORUS. 
Arrah Bridget Donahue, I 
have got my eye on you, 
And if you marry Barney you'll have no cause to rue; 
You're the apple of me eye, and my Irish cuchatoo, 
Mister Cupid knocked me stupid, all for 
Bridget Donahue. 
At the wedding of Pat there sure I 
first met 
Bridget there, 
And as she sat beside me at the wedding table, 
She handed me her tea, but I 
felt I 
couldn't say, 
And my heart it melted like a 
lump of butter. 
I 
asked her there and then if she'd have me for a 
man, 
,She gave me a 
smile as cute as any- jailor, 
She said it would give her pride and praise that 
lam satisfied, 
For she loves no one else but Barney Blake the tailor. 
She's modest and she's mild, she's a 
desent 
father's child, 
And I 
am longing for the day that we will be married; 
And I'd go from here to Spain to hear her sing 
Napoleon's drame, 
And for dancing she has a 
lovely carriage. 
All other chaps they try to put out Barney's eye, 
But sure they find it nothing but a 
failure 
For she wouldn't see me fooled, she's as pure as 
genuine wade, 
To her rumping, stumping tareing Irish tailor,

Who is fit for any sort of proper jolly sport, 
And a

When he comes on the shore, you should hear

He's up to every little game; 
When he comes home at night, he's so jolly tight, 
Singing little Johnny Tilden is his name.

And I'm never going to see her any more; 
For indeed I 
cannot part from the girl that 
stole my heart, 
But stop with the lass I 
do adore. 
And make that girl my wife, and be happy all my life, 
For single I 
no longer will remain. 
But I'll be blest with joy, with some little girls 
and boys, 
Then I'll be a 
man of fame. 
Chorus. 
I 
named the happy day, I 
feel so light and gay, 
I 
am thinking of the pleasant time to come; 
All sailors will be there, to you I 
do declare, 
And won't there be some sailoring fun; 
For when sailor's they get tight, it is their great delight 
To have a 
pretty girl upon his knee, 
Then they cut a 
dash, and freely spend their cash, 
Then leave the shore and go again to sea.

I 
hope you all will pay attention, 
And give heed to what I 
say; 
A 
few words to you I 
will mention, 
If you'll listen to my lay. 
I 
fell in love with a 
charming creature, 
And the truth to you I'll tell, 
The name that thie fair one goes under, 
Is the lovely Arabell.

Arm in arm with Arabella, 
Don't I 
do the la-da-da; 
Should there any girls admire me, 
When I 
say to them ta-ta. 
The way I 
got this introduction, 
I 
mean to let you understand; 
Her handkerchief dropped, I 
picked it up quick 
And gave it into her hand. 
She says, young man, I 
thank you kindly, 
Those were the words she did reply, 
I 
kissed the hand that she held to me, 
Then at me she looked so shy. 
Chorus. 
We walked and talked as we proceeded, 
And our subject was of love; 
In fact I 
thought this girl an angel 
From the regions from above. 
At last my boys I 
plucked up my courage, 
And to her did softly insist, 
Pray fair maid you will excuse me, 
If I 
steal one little kiss.

We are two Irishmen born, we are proud to own that, 
And just came before you to prove we're no flat, 
And praise up old Erin, ami those born there in, 
Who 
lived and died under the green flag of Erin. 
CHORUS. 
Hurrah! hurrah! for the green flag cf Erin, 
The green flag of Erin, and bright standing there in, 
Proud we're to say, we were born one fine day 
under the green flag of Erin. 
Now where is the nation out from the rest, 
Can equal the land that St. Patrick blest; 
Or where are the heroes more undaunted and dareing, 
Than those you'll find under the green flag of Erin.

Come all ye true-born Irishmen, 
And sons Of Paddy's land; 
Draw near and pay attention, 
And we'll let you understand 
We are educated gentlemen, 
Frdm Leatrim we are sent, 
To represent old Grannuail, 
Up in parliament. 
We are the boys, the two Molloy's, 
From the County Leatrim sent; 
And we are two of the noblest lads, 
That sits in parliament. 
And all the foes that dare oppose 
A 
word of what we say, 
Upon my soul we'll knock them down, 
On next St.. Patrick's Day. 
When we go into parliament, 
The nobility they rise, 
And come and shake us by the hand, 
For we are the great Moloy's. 
To us they bow, then we allow 
Them to go away: 
And it's round about you'll hear them shout, 
Three cheers for Patrick's day. 
Chorus. 
Now when we made our maidin speech, 
The nobility they smiled; 
And said we were the greatest lords 
In dear old Erin's isle.

If you take things cool, you'll have home rule 
On next St Patrick's day.

She Stole My Heart Away.

BY PALLES & CUSICK. 
One lovely summer's morning, in the merry 
month of June, 
I 
espied a 
pretty damsel, amidst flowers sweet perfume 
Her eyes did shine like diamonds, her teeth as 
white as pearl, 
ne'er forget the day I 
met this pretty little girl. 
CHORUS. 
She was sitting in a 
shady bower, (Break.) 
Twining up some little flower; (Break.) 
She's a 
charming little cfeature, just like the 
flowers in May, 
I'll ne'er forget when first we met she stole my 
heart away. 
Her cheeks as red-as roses, her hair like threads of gold. 
She was a 
perfect Venus, and just sixteen years old, 
Her waist was small, her neck white as the swan, 
She was the prettiest creature that I 
ever gazed upon.

EVERY DAY, 
I've a 
nice little cabin that's built with mud, 
In the beautiful County Kildare, 
I've got acres of land, and men at command, 
And I 
have always a 
shilling to spare. 
Och I 
I 
didn't come here, boys, in search of a 
job, 
But just a 
short visit to pay, 
And as I 
walk through the streets, people say 
that I

There's the man you don't meet every day.

Then call for your glasses, just have what you want, 
And whatever the damage I'll pay; 
Bhoys be airy and free when you're drinking wid me, 
For I'm the man you den't meet every day. 
When I 
landed in Glasgow, what a 
sight met 
my eyes, 
As I 
first put my foot on the shore; 
There was Felix O'Donough, blind Barney McGurk, 
And a 
round two or.three dozen more. 
Och! murther! you ought to have seen them 
all stare, 
And then they did all run away; 
Says I, •• my spalpeens, do you think I'm a

I'm in love with a

am here to greet you all,

I 
got a 
job of work,

did upon that very same occasion;

And lit upon the nob 
Of a 
German peddlar of the Jew persuasion; 
Sheeney called hard names to Pat, 
For the bricks had broke his hat; 
I 
was angry, and the truth I

REGAN'S PARTY, 
WOBDS AND MUSIC BY WM CARROLL. SUNG BY THE ISEURPTI'S. 
brutsro PUB. & 
COPYRIGHT, 1881 BY WM. J. A. LIEDRIL 
It was over at old Regan's house, we had a 
jolly time, 
There was lots of dancing, I 
tell you it was fine,' 
Oh ! the boys and girls enjoyed themselves, for 
they came far and near, 
And all the lads assembled there, to try old 
Regan's beer. 
Old Regan he felt lively for a 
time, 
And a 
happier man I 
don't think could be found, 
He told us that the house was ours, to do just as 
we liked, 
So then we had a 
drink of bear all round, 
CHORUS. 
Oh! such singing, and such dancing pon my 
word ' twits really grand, 
And the f.nusic sounded just as well as if it was a 
band, 
While Murphy played the fiddle, they danced 
up and down the middle, 
And we never left old Regan till the morn. 
There was Mary Jones and Jerry Flynn got up 
to dance a 
jig, 
Along with Michael Gronin's wife, who looked 
like Murphy's pig, 
The floor they welted beautiful, and went round 
hand in hand, 
But Cronin's wife she danced so much that she 
could hardly stand, 
Then James O'Brien he got up to sing a 
song, 
But they did not seem to relish it one bit, 
They yanked him out so gently that he thought 
his time had come, 
And the poor old fellow fell into a 
lit. 
Chorus. 
They danced away till broad daylight, the sun 
broke in tho sky, 
But McCarthy's wife was so fatigued, she thought 
she'd really die, 
M'Griinness got overpowered on wine and lager beer, 
He felt so good he tried to do a 
pirouette on his ear, 
And poor old Jerry Dolan was found sleeping 
With a 
vice like grip upon a 
china cup, 
And when they danced the last quadrille the 
fiddler fell asleep, 
And that's what wound old Regan's party up.

There's a 
dear spot of land far out on the sea, 
And it's known as fair Erin's green isle ; 
Sure it's there I 
was born on a 
bright summer's morn. 
And with joy my relations did smile. 
My father and mother, my sister and brother, 
Were pleased, to- be- sure, all the while. 
They shed tears of joy, for their bright Irish boy, 
That was born on fair Erin's green isle, 
Ton may talk about France, or England or Spain, 
Of their beautiful maids and grant men ; 
But the whole world does know that fair Erin can show, 
Nobler sons, truer daughters, than them. 
Such names as O'Connell and Moore I 
will mention, 
And brave Duke of Wellington, while 
King Brian Boroghue, and our bold Emmett toss, 
bail the light on fair Erin's Green Isle. 
There's the Killarney lakes on Erin's Green Isle, 
They're so lovely enchanting and fine. 
Sure the valley's and mountain's are secoed to Beek 
For their beauty is really sublime. 
There grows in profusion the dear little shamroeic, 
Encouraged by Nature's sweet smile, 
Dear land of-my birth, garden spot of the ear* 
You're my idol fair Erin's Green

THE PATTER OF THE SHINGLE. 
RECITED BT JOE HIRT. 
When the angry passion gathering 
In my mother's face I 
see; 
And she leads me to the bed-chamber, 
Gently lays me on her knee. 
Then I 
know that I 
will catch it, 
And my flesh in fancy itches, 
As I 
listen to the patter 
Of the shingle on my breeches. 
Every tinkle of the shingle, 
Has an echo and a 
sting, 
And a 
thousand burning fancies 
Into active being spring. 
And a 
thousand bees and hornets, 
Beneath my coat-tail seem to swarm, 
And 1 
feel the patter 
Of the shingle, oh 
so warm. 
In a 
sudden intermision, 
Which appears my only chance, 
I 
say strike gently, mother, 
Or you'll split my Sunday panls. 
She stops a 
moment. draws her breath, 
The shingle holds aloft, 
,
And says, I 
had not thought of that, 
My son just take them breeches oft 
Holy Moses and the ngels, 
Cast your pittying glances down, 
And you, good family doctor, 
Put a 
good soft poultice on. 
And may I 
with fools and dunces 
Everlastingly mingle, 
if I 
ever say another word, 
When my mother wields the shingle.

But of all I

For he ain't fast 'ceptin' he am hit, 
He ain't pretty to be old; 
But he am faithful, good and kind, 
And that am more dan gold. 
He never runs away wid me, 
Nor cuts up any shines, 
For he am de best nag in dis town 
That old bay mule of mine. 
On Sundays when I

I

For me that poor soul pines;

Be home early, to-night, my dear boy; 
Don't spend all your money to gamble and drink, 
Be home early, to-night, my dear boy. 
One night I 
left home, and my poor mother was sick, 
In fever of torture and pain; 
She says, my dear boy, take the motto I 
give, 
I 
may not give it to you again. 
But when I 
returned from my night's fun and joy, 
I 
heard my poor mother was dead. 
'Twas then a 
cold chill through my body did run, 
When I 
thought of the last words she said. 
Cho. 
All young men that are here, take a 
word of advice, 
To your father and mother attend ; 
For a 
good mother's love it must not be forgot, 
When she's gone you've lost your best friend, 
Don't spend all your money to gamble and drink, 
There ,
i.re many things on can enjoy; 
Take the lesson I 
givelwas a 
mother's request, 
Keep good hours at night my dear boys.

Ther'es a 
dear spot of land far out on the ocean, 
The prettiest island that ever was seen; 
There's no place on earth that sc well suits 
my notion. 
It's the Emerald isle where the shamrock is grass, 
Alas I 
the bold tyrant has taken possession. 
And driven our daughters and sons to exile, 
For no one could stand their tyranic aggression, 
And banished are we from the Emerald Isle. 
CHORUS. 
Then its God speed the day that will dawn with 
our freedom, 
When the stars and the harp shall be blended as one, 
Then the poor of ould Ireland will need no help 
to feed them, 
They'll belong to the country c 
-.3,1rave Washington. 
When I 
left my dear home n poor heo,rt was 
breaking, 
Oh ! 'tis a 
sad moment the parting of friends, 
The tear-be-dimed eyes, and the honest 
hand-shaking, 
Oh I 
that causes the stoute ,t 
of hearts to unbend, 
But there are occasions when v artings a 
pleasure, 
And one is in crossing the beautiful sea; 
Where toil is rewarded by friendship and treasure. 
In the home of the brave and the land of the free.

But she will make her time.

No difference in the fare.

As happy as any young pair, 
Would join in the pleasure's and laugh at the ftui,

Good-natured, contented they sit the long day, 
The blessings of old age to share; 
No thoughts of sorrow comes over them now,

THE BLUE ALSATIAN MOUNTAINS, 
CLARA_RELL. 
MUSIC BY STEPHEN 
By the 
the blue Alsatian mountains, 
Dwelt a 
maiden young and fair; 
Like the careless flowing fountains 
Were the ripples of her h,air. 
'Were the ripples of her hair; 
Angel mild, her eyes so winning, 
ingel bright her happy smile, 
When beneath the fountain spinning, 
A-de, A-de, Ade, 
Such songs will pass away; 
Tho' the blue Alsatian mountains, 
Seem to watch and wait alway! 
By the blue Alsatian mountains, 
Many spring-times bloomed and passed. 
And the maiden by the fountains, 
Saw she lost her hopes at last, 
She lost, her hopes at last. 
And she withered like a 
flower, 
That is waiting for the rain; 
She will never see the stranger,. 
-Where the fountains fall again. 
A-de, A-de, A-de, 
The years have passed away, 
But the blu Lian mountains 
Ever watch and wait alway, 
A-de, A-do, A-do. 
The years have passed away, 
But the blue Alsatian mountains, 
Seem to watch and v-Ait alway. 
By the blue Alsatiar mountains; 
Came a 
stranre I 
the spring, 
And he lingerea -uy the fountains, 
Just tc hear the maiden sing, 
Just to hear the maiden sing; 
Just to whisper in the moonlight, 
Words the sweetest she had known, 
Just to charm away the hours, 
Till her heart was all his own. 
A-de, A-de, A- de, 
Such dreams must pass away. 
But the blue Alsatian mountain*, 
seem to watch and wait alway.

A 
ROW OF TENEMENT HOUSES. 
SUNG BY NILES & EVANS. 
LIB: BLUE ALSATIAN MOIINTAISS. 
In a 
row of tenement houses, 
Lived a 
damsel young and fair, 
Her papa wore the trousers 
When her mamma wasn't there. 
/trodden with a 
dimpled eyebrow, 
With a 
voice so young and 'fair, 
Maiden with a 
yaller bull-dog, 
That followed her everywhere. 
Each day, each day, each day. 
Some family would move away, 
For that row of tenement houses 
Never seemed to please or pay. 
To that row of tenement houses 
Came a 
granger in the Spring, 
-Just to talk of sheeps and cowses, 
And to hear that maiden sing. 
Just to hear that maiden sing, 
Oh ! he spoke about his barnyard, 
-Of his chickens and his hog; 
But she thought he was giving her taffy, 
:So she called her yaller dog. 
Hurrah, hurrah, hurrah! 
That granger he ran away, 
But left the bosom of his trouses, 
For the dog to chew that day.
