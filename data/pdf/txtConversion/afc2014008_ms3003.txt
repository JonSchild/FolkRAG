Dear Pai
.i.y:
 
L
 
Patty, I
'm sorry, but you're involved in something that i
s s
o compl icated
 
that I just do not have time to help you.  I have talked to Jerry Parsons
 
(
Joe Hickerson's associate at the Archive of American Folk Songs at the
 
Library of Congress) and he is sending you some materials that might be
 
useful.  However, he agrees with me that if you want to do serious research
 
on those particular songs (
or -
-
 frankly -
-
 any other "public domain" songs)
 
you will have to do it in Washington, and it will take some tine -
 four
 
to six weeks of an experienced researcher's time and salary.
 
You can, of course, finesse the whole i
ssue and s
imply not do it -  -
 ignore
 
it.  The practicality of the latter move depends on how serious your publisher
 
is.  If you're putting out a little booklet with a relatively unknown
 
publisher to a basically local market, it might be worth it to take the
 
chance, and simply say that the songs you are using are not copyrighted.
 
I
owever, if you are working with a major publisher, you must take c
are oF
 
all valid legal claims.
 
I can suggest some people who could help you out 11
1 l S: i1J
t )t,  1nt1
 t would
 
cost you some money.  Let me know if you want a recor
'nendatioii or two, and
 
I
'll send you their names.  I will be out of Washington until T

May  1st, 1979
 
Dear Bess;
 
I am finally at the stage with my book on music for teachers
 
and parents of young children, where I am deciding on which songs
 
toinclude in it and trying to locate sources and information for
 
releases for use of the songs. However, I find it difficult to
 
know how to proceed in some cases, and therefore am wting to
 
you to see if you might know how to handle the following:
 
(1) versions of folk songs I
've learned from people or
 
alterred slightly, or arranged (chords and 1 y).
 
(
2) Nursery Rhymes or traditional play party songs like
 
"Skip to My LOU" (
lasing words only on that one).
 
Who do I write to or where, if  at all, for permissions.
 
I hope you can advise me onthis. I want to use the following songs..
 
For some of these I will use the words • oly, to illustrate a point
 
I
'm discussing in the text. For others, I want to use my own musical
 
arrangements (chords only) as well as rendition of the songs (as
 
in Jenny Jenkins-the words may not be as sung in some original or
 
earlier versions, I
'm not sure).
 
Anyway, copies of them as I would use them are enclosed,
 
and they are: (1) Hush Little Baby, (2) There Was a Man and He
 
Was Mad, (3) Jenny Jenkins), and (4) pUnchinello (
 which I learned
 
from a teacher, whose child taught it to her  as sung on the school
 
playground.), and (5) Little Cottage in the Woods (Pete doesn't seem
 
to know where to find the author if there is Rn one. )
 
I want to use words only for (1) Skip to My Lou, (2) Paw .
 
Paw Patch(only one verse of these two songs), (3) Frere  Jacque
 
(4) Twinkle Twink7  Little Star, 4nd (5) Siem Bar
n Bar
n, Mammy's Baby
 
-
2-
Many of these  songs have been published, with no source given
 
or authors if there are any, and that is why I am writing to you.
 
If there is someone I should credit for composing or collecting the
 
songs, I want to do so, also If necessary to get permissions for
 
use I want to write to whoever I have to for that.
 
I realize this is a lot for you to do, and if you would
 
like some payment for the work, please let me know . I am  enc
los ing  
a stamped, self- addressed envelope and await your reply.
 
Thank you very much.
 
Sincerely yours,
 
.

This requires a little imagination  on your part, but it is
 
great fun, and a wonderful creative experience with a whole group.
 
You can also try it with "There Was a Man and He Was Mad", but since
 
t
}ds song rhymes (Buy Me A China Doll doesn't), I usually play a
 
"warm up" rhyming game before I try it with four or five year olds.
 
Some younger children,  t
hough, are very good at rhyming, especially
 
with a song like "Jenny Jenkins",

Hope this will not be too much trouble--I have only one
 
auestion and I hope it's a simple  one--if not just let me know.
 
T found that "Hush Little Baby" was part of the estate of Johan
 
A Lomax, aE listed by Ruth Crawford Seeger when she published it
 
in "American Folk Songs for Gildren". Isn't it a traditional s
ong,
 
or can I get a release through you..  . Anyway here is a form, if
 
you are the person to sign it--or if there's someone  else, please
 
let me know.
