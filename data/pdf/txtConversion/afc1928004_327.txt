"PRETTY WAITER GIRL." 
Hildebrant Montrose." 
W E 
met within the gay saloon, 
Her eyes they sparkled sweetly; 
The fiddles played their liveliest tune, 
My heart was won Completely; 
She charmed me with her pretty ways 
And form of matchless grace; 
She looked just like a 
fairy— 
A 
sunbeam in the place I 
SPOKEN.—And this is what she said— 
CHORUS. 
Tra la, tin le, my Charlie, dear, 
What is it going to be, love, champagne or beer? 
She was the sweetest charmer, my heart was in a 
whirl,— 
I 
never can forget her, that pretty waiter girl. 
Though others thronged that gay saloon 
She smiled upon me only; 
Her pensive air it seemed to say— 
I 
am so sad and lonely; 
Her eyes so softly glanced at me, 
Then drooped with modest look, 
I 
felt just like a 
little fish 
Just caught upon a 
hook. 
SPOICEN. — When our eyes met she would sigh and say— 
Tra la, tra le, etc. 
Her smiles were like the bright champagne, 
Her cheeks were like bright sherry; 
I 
came to see her every night,— 
The time it passed so merry. 
Her image in my constant heart 
I 
carried day by day, 
And in my dreams at midnight 
I 
often heard her say— 
SPOZE.N.—This— 
Tra la, try, le, eta. 
At last I 
told her all my love, 
And asked her would she marry ? 
She blushed just like a 
peony, 
And begged me for to tarry; 
She turned away with modest air, 
And heaved a 
gentle sigh; 
Oh, how her eyes did sparkle 
When thus she made reply— 
Tra la, tra le, etc.

THE TWO OBADLAHS. 
By 
R. 
R EC. 
SATs the young Obadiah to the old Obadiah, 
" 
Let us go out, Obadiah, for a 
lark." 
Says the old Obadiah to the young Obadiah, 
" 
Keep it dark, Obadiah, keep it dark! 
For I 
know a 
little tavern where they like a 
merry mood, 
Where the charge is strictly moderate, and all the liquors good; 
Slope the backway, and the ILI
SSiS needn't know where we are 
gone!" 
Says the young Obadiah, " I 
am on!" 
Says the young Obadiah to the old Obadiah, 
" 
Who's to pay, Obadiah, who's to pay 1" 
Says the old Obadiah to the young Obadiah, 
" 
Well, you may, Obadiah, dear, you may 
To your parent, I'll observe, ' twould be but dutiful and just,' 
And you needn't spend much money, if you get it all ' on trust.' 
I 
never felt so much inclined for larks in all my life!" 
Says the young Obadiah, "Here's your wife ! " 
Says Missis Obadiah to the old Obadiah, 
" 
I've your hat, Obadiah, I've your hat!" 
SP.ys the old Obadiah to his Missis Obadiah, 
" 
Then, Missis Obadiah. you're a 
cat ! " 
Says Missis Obadiah, " All this selfishness is stuff; 
If you'll take me out this evening I'm agreeable enough! 
For of some such relaxation, dear, I 
long have felt the need t" 
Says the Messrs. Obadiah, " Oh, be d—d !" 
Said the old Obadiah to his Missis Obadiah, 
" 
Our conversation then.. you've overheard." 
Says Missis Obadiah to her old Obadiah, 
"Ev'ry word, Obadiah, eery word! 
After which, Obadiah, there is only left one course, 
You wicked old imposter, I 
shall sue for a 
divorce, 
Or get a 
separation, and my alimony claim!" 
Said both the Obadiahs, " Here's a !game t" 
Says Missis Obadiah to the old Obadiah, 
" 
Here's my bonnet, and I'm going off this minute I" 
Says the old Obadiah to his Missis Obadiah, 
" 
And very nice, old lady, you look in it!" 
Says Missis Obadiah, " I 
am going right away, 
After what has happened in this house I 
certainly shan't stay, 
No doubt you'll both be happier when I 
am very far I" 
Says both the Obadie.h.s, " Right you are!"

rEN ALLANNA, Eileen Astbore, 
Light of my soul and its queen evermore. 
It seems years have lingered since last we did part, 
Eileen Allanna, the pride of my heart. 
OH 
darling lov'a one, your dear smile I 
miss, 
My lips seem to cling to that sweet parting kiss, 
liavourneen, thy sweet face I 
see at the door,

Faithful I'll be to the colleen I

Eileen Allanna, Eilleen Asthore, 
The ocean's blue waters wash by the shore 
Of that dear land of shamrock where thou dost abide, 
Waiting the day when 
rail thee my bride. 
God bless you, darling, I 
know you are true, 
True to the boy who would die now for you. 
My heart is now bleeding to its innermost core, 
Eileen Allanna, Augus Asthore.

Soon I'll be back to the colleen I

" NORAH 
IS DREAMING OP YOU." 
SWEETLY the stars up above us are dreaming, 
The birds they are dreaming of morn; 
Sad is the moon, tho' in radiance beaming, 
She's dreaming alone and forlorn; 
Roses and lilies so gentle and loving, 
Are dreaming, I 
know, in the dew, 
So when afar _Fuu are thoughtlessly roving, 
Your Norah is dreaming of you! 
Still I 
am waiting, so sadly and lonely, 
0, tell me if still you are true! 
Drelm of me, darling, for one moment only, 
While Norah, your Norah is dreaming of you I 
Tao' you forget me when far you are roaming, 
I 
shall not believe it, my— own 
Don't you remember you said in the gloaming, 
That I 
was your darling alone! 
Come to my heart like a 
bird that is weary, 
Oh, come to your Norah so true! 
Linger not long, for the days they are weary, 
While Norah is dreaming of you! 
Still I 
am wailing. eta.

SLAVERY DAYS. 
Words by ED. HARRIGAN. 
Music by DAVE BRAHAN. 
The Music of this song is published by Wm. A. POND & CO., 547 Broad, 
way, New York. Price 40 cents. 
I 
AM thinking to-day 
Of dem years dat passed away, 
When dey tied me up in bondage long ago; 
In old Virginny State, 
It was dar we separate, 
And it fill'd my heart with misery and woe. 
Dey took away my boy, 
He was his mother's joy ; 
From a 
baby in de cradle we him raise; 
Oh, dey put us far apart, 
An' it broke de ole man's heart, 
In dem agonizing, cruel slav'ry days. 
CHORUS. 
Dey never come again, 
Let us give our praise to Him 
Who looks down whar de little children play; 
So ev'ry night and morn, 
We will pray for dem dat's gone, 
In dem agonizing, cruel slav'ry days. 
'Still my menery will steal o'er 
To dat dear old cabin floor, 
When de shadow of de sun came peepingoin; 
At night, when all was dark, 
We would hear de watch-dog bark, 
And we'd listen to de murmur of de wind. 
It seem to say to me, 
" 
You people must be free," 
For de happy time am coming, Lord be prais'd 
For then we would weep and moan, 
For our souls was not our own, 
In dem agonizing, cruel slav'ry days. 
Dey never, etc. 
I 
am very old and feeble, 
And our life am nearly done ; 
I 
have travell'd in the roughest kind of road; 
Thro' sickness, toil and sorrow, 
I 
have reach'd de end at last, 
And I'm resting by de wayside wid my load. 
Forget now and forgive, 
has always been my guide, 
For dat's what de golden Scripture surely says; 
But our meiu'ry will turn round, 
When our souls dey were tied down, 
In dem agonizing, cruel slav'ry days. 
Dey never, etc. 
WE CAN'T AGREE.

SKELLY.

HARDING, 229 Bowery, New

Copyright, 1876, by E. II. lanni-No. 
As soon as I 
got married, 
A 
happy man to be, 
My wife turn'd out a 
sorry jade— 
We never could agree; 
For what I 
thought my greatest bliss, 
.Was grief that made me sore: 
And now my only sorrow is— 
She's mine forevermore. 
CHORUS. 
We can't agree, we can't agree; 
I 
scowl at her, she scowls at me; 
Such despair I 
have to bear, 
0, would that I 
were free ! 
From noon till night we scold and fight, 
0, such a 
matrimonial blight! 
Death alone can set me right! 
We can't, we can't agree. 
About a 
week or something less 
A 
gentle thing was she, 
But ere the second Sunday came 
She had the best of me; 
Now oftentimes I 
cry alas I 
And sadly I 
complain, 
But with the cause of my complaint 
For life I 
must remain. 
We can't agree, eta 
When I 
am in for soberness, 
She goes distracted mad! 
And when I 
am for merriment, 
0 
then she's always sad; 
And when I 
wish to hear her speak, 
She's dumb as she can be— 
No matter what we say or do, 
It seems we can't agree! 
We can't agree, etc. 
Last nighi Tom Jenkins and myself 
Went out our throats to wet— 
She thundered in my ears so loud 
I 
think I 
hear her yet; 
But when she gets her temper up, 
Which often is the case. 
The first thinr that comes to her hand 
She dashes in my face. 
We can't agree, etc. 
That marriage is a 
paradise 
I've heard some people say, 
But for my own part I 
declare 
It seems the other way ! 
And yet there is a 
comfort left, 
One comfort left to me— 
The pangs of death will break tbe banns— 
Alas! we can't agree. 
We can't agree, etc.

aw - ful - ly 
jol - ly, That spoon-Mg on 
the 
San 
When free from all the noise of town, 
Now is'nt there a 
charm 
To wander with a 
little hand 
Laid gently on your arm ? 
Then tender words and loving looks, 
And pressure of the hands, 
All seem to come so natural 
When spooning on the sands.—Cao. 
Old bachelors grow thoughtful as 
A happy pair goes past, 
And ancient maidens fondly hope 
Their turn may come at last; 
Then servants wish those children, whe 
Are playing on the strand, 
Were far away, and wouldn't they 
Go spooning on the sand ?—Cno. 
Papa and ma have had their day, 
And so they only smile, 
When bonnie Kate and handsome Jack 
Are absent such a 
while 
Of course. they say they only stayed 
To listen to the bands, 
To look at them, you'd think that they'd 
Been spooning on the sands.—Cao. 
Those sands are often quicksands, and 
When I 
their charms recall 
I 
only wonder we have left 
Unmarried folks at all; 
There's magic in fhose sad sea waves 
That no one can withstand, 
And if you doubt me, try a 
little 
"Spooning on the sand."—Cao.

LAZY CLUE. 
Az—" Green grow the Rashes, ate° 
My wife is such a 
lazy Turk, 
She will not do a 
bit of work; 
She says she isn't such a 
flat, 
Hard work will never make her fat. 
But in the morning when she wakes, 
Her breakfast up stairs then she takaa 
She treats herself to toast and shrub, 
And says she's joined a 
lazy club. 
C11011.1:13-
Skiddy mi dig, ri to ra lo, 
Skiddy mi dig, ri to ra lo. 
Skiddy mi dig, ri to ra lo. 
Skiddy mi dig, ri to ra lo. 
When she takes it in her head, 
She makes me lift her out of bed; 
To say a 
word, I 
do not dare, 
But place her in an easy chair. 
To stir a 
peg it seems a 
crime; 
Why, there she sits till supper time, 
While I'm obliged to cook the grub, 
Because she's joined the lazy club. 
Skiddy mi dig, fee. 
My eldest daughter's just as bad— 
I 
really think she's lazy mad; 
She seems too lazy now to talk, 
And scarce seems half inclined to walk; 
Her tongue is never free from scolds, 
Her shoes are always full of holes, 
Her dress is never free from mud,

LAZY CLITB.—[coromunaD.] 
My dutiful son shows off his airs; 
He cannot sit without three chairs, 
And he pretends he's got the gout, 
And wants me then to carry him about. 
He is too lazy to go to bed, 
So snores upon the chair instead, 
Wanted me to give his boots a 
rub, 
In honor of the lazy club. 
Skiddy mi dig, &o. 
We keep a 
girl about sixteen, 
To mind the house and keep it clean, 
But lawks, she is such a 
lazy elf, 
I'm obliged to do it all myself; 
And if I 
ask her then to stir, 
She says I 
ought to wait upon her, 
And give the yard and kitchen a 
scrub, 
In honor of the lazy club. 
Skiddy mi dig, dm. 
We keep a 
very lazy dog, 
Who lays about, just like a 
log; 
He seems too lazy to wag his tail, 
And trys to imitate the snail, 
Before the fire all in a 
heap; 
Why, there he lies, goes fast asleep, 
And lawks, he is such a 
lazy chub, 
I 
think he's joined the lazy club. 
Skiddy, mi dig, dm. 
And now I 
am in a 
pretty mess, 
Through their cursed laziness; 
And now my debts I 
cannot pay, 
In prison shall be obliged to lay, 
When I 
ara there, the lazy elves, 
They'll be obliged to help themselves, 
And no doubt, when they're in want of grub, 
They must get it from the lazy club.

RE PLAYED ON T il, DRUM." 
Ain:—" N. G. S. N. Y." 
Oh, don't I 
know the nicest chap, as lovely as a 
rose, • 
Whenever on the street 
e 
meet, sheep's eyes at me he 
throws, 
I'll tell you what my darling does, that is if you'll keep 
mum, 
He walks behind a 
big brass-band, and plays upon the 
Drum. 
CHORUS. 
He played on the Drum, with his rat, tat, tat, tat, tat 
And my little heart, oh, he made it go pit-a-pat! 
He smil'd as he passed, I 
know he loves me some ! 
And rat, tat, tat, tat, oh, he played on the Drum ! 
He serenades me every night, when Pa and Ma's asleep, 
And thro' the window blinds I 
glance, and slyly take a 
peep, 
Once in awhile he wakes the house, and then he looks so 
glum, 
When Papa throws a 
boot-jack at my true love with his 
Drum. 
Ile played on the Drum, & c. 
But best of all, I 
like to see my darling on Parade, 
He ever throws the grenadier Drum Major in the shade ! 
I 
cannot see the trumpets bright, nor hear them go " turn, 
turn," 
The only thing that charms my heart, is that delightful 
Drum. 
He played on the Drum, (Stc. 
He asked me if I'd have him, and I 
told him that I 
would, 
And were to married be in style, for that is understood, 
So if in course of time, Heav'n sends us kindly some Rem] 
Delightful joys, I'll teach them all to play upon the Drum.

THE HUED'! GURDY LAD. 
I 
don't feel very happy, nor I 
don't feel very sad, 
So put me down as middling, although it is too bad; 
For any girl to serve a 
chap, as lately I've been served, 
But no girl shall take me in again, ill never take their word. 
A 
girl I 
courted for six months, her Christian name was Fanny, 
I 
asked her if she'd have me, and she said she would be glad; 
But at present her intention was to stay home with her mammy, 
And she couldn't think of parting with her dear old darling dad. 
CHORUS. 
Yes, she said 'twould break her heart 
To go and leave her mammy, 
She said 'twould break her heart, 
To go and leave her dad ; 
But she's run away from both, 
My false, deceitful Fanny, 
And travels about the country, 
With a 
Hurdy Curdy Lad. 
Now Fanny wasn't handsome, but I 
thought she was sincere, 
And then she had such winning ways, that made me her revere, 
But a 
hurdy-gurdy grinder, he used to come our way, 
And for Fanny's recreation, for hours he used to play; 
He:d play awhile, then dance a 
bit, and then he'd sing a 
ditty, 
And I 
often gave a 
penny to the dirty half- growl\ man, 
He said he was an orphan, that caus'd me him to pity. 
But never thought he'd cheek enough to run away with Fan. 
And as for her, she said, (to. 
Her father and mother were very fond of me, 
And often did invite me my Fanny for to see, 
I 
found her father ' bacca, and I 
found her mother rum. 
And on Fanny I 
invested a 
very tidy sum, 
For Fanny was a 
girl I 
always thought so well of; 
When I 
think how she, served me, it my peace of mind destroys, 
Now of Old Mother Cummings I'd often heard tell of, 
But I 
never thought she'd run off with the biggest of her boys. 
For she said, &e. 
Now when her father told me that Fan had cut her stick, 
I 
felt as if I 
had received a 
blow with half a 
brick, 
For I 
alway thought that Fanny, a 
little more pride had, 
Than to travel about the country with a 
hurdy-gurdy lad. 
I 
hear she's got a 
tambourine, and a 
voice that's loud and ringing 
And often in my wanderings, I 
fancy I 
shall meet 
This hurdy-pHy grinder, and Fanny doing the singing, 
aiving a 
morning concert to some children in the street. 
For she said, ‘tc

ENOUGH IS AS GOOD AS A FEAST. 
Words by J. B. GEOGHEGAN. 
Musk by J. Bli•onzznan. 
• 
As I 
ramble the city, I 
often reflect 
On the bustle and and toil we endure, 
And think what a 
life of confusion and strife, 
There is in this world to be sure; 
No matter the calling, condition or age, 
From the loftiest down to the least, 
They all seek more gold, tho' the proverb of old 
Says enough is as good as a 
feast. 
CHORUS. 
The saying is trite, 
But ' tis none the less right, 
For however your store is increased, 
You will leave it behind, 
So bear this in your mind, 
That enough is as good as a 
feast. 
What folly to envy your neighbor his wealth, 
When perhaps if his secrets were known, 
He's so much to pay for his wants ey'ry day, 
That his riches are less than your own ; 
Should your income be small, make your outgoings less, 
You'll have one consolation at least, 
When you lay down to rest you can say with the best, 
I've enough, that's as good as a 
feast. 
The saying is trite, etc. 
How oft will the reveller riot in wine, 
Till of sense he is fairly bereft, 
And the juice once so full, grows insipid and dull. 
And he's scarcely a 
happiness left; 
He's a 
plague to himself and a 
shame to his friends, 
And in reason is worse than a 
beast, 
For the veriest ass that e'er nibbled the grass, 
Knows enough is as good as a 
feast. 
The saying is trite, etc. 
Then think on the maxim and follow the rule ; 
It's meaning to all will apply ; 
It would suit even fame did it honor your name, 
But fame never comes till you die; 
He is not the most happy who owns the most gold, 
Nor he the worst off that owns least; 
If you think you've enough, tho' your table be rough, 
Why, enough is as good as a 
feast. 
The saying is trite, etc.

THAT'S THE PROPER CAPER. 
entered according to Act of Congress, in the year 1874, by E 
K, Hutente, 
in the Office of the Librarian of Congress, at Washington, D. C. 
I 
am a 
man of easy mind, 
I 
know no care or woe, 
I 
make myself agreeable 
Wherever I 
may go; 
My friends I 
count them by thy score— 
The reason I 
will tell, 
I 
always do things properly, 
And consequently well. 
CHORUS. 
That's the proper caper, that's the proper caper; 
When things are done in proper style, I 
always like to say, 
That's the proper caper, that's the proper caper; be fair and 
True in all you do, for that's the proper way. 
The other day I 
met a 
friend, 
A very nice young man; 
I 
asked him could he dine with me; 
Of course he said, I 
can; 
We dined and wined in sumptuous style, 
And smoked our Henry Clays; 
And when we parted he remarked, 
My friend, I 
like your ways. 
That's the proper caper, etc. 
My sweetheart is a 
pretty girl, 
So lovely and so fair; 
Some day she's going to marry me, 
My future life to share; 
A 
rich young man was after her, 
But_his love she could not see; 
$he told him he was not the thing, 
She rather fancied me. 
That's the proper caper, etc

BANJO SOLO- 4, COMING THRO' THE RYE." 
Bung by HARRY STAIMOOD. 
Old Mother Hubbard she went to the cupboard 
To save her poor dog's health, 
Mary said to her little lamb, 
You know how it is yourself. 
The boy that would a-wooing go 
Was in the cold ground laid. 
Oh, Johnny, I 
hardly knew you since 
You joined the tree lunch Brigade. 
Champagne Charley is my name, 
While rolling home in the morn, 
Maggie sittineby my side 
I 
tell you den I 
was gone. 
Oh put me in my little bed 
I 
just want forty winks, 
I'm lonely since my mother died 
And so is Captain Jinks. 
The forty thieves have stolen my heart, 
Musquitos stung my ear, 
The soldier leaned upon his sword 
Then wiped away a 
tear, 
On the Beach at Long Branch 
I 
walked with bonny Jean 
They were hanging frogs in Canada 
For the wearing of the green. 
Hark I 
hear an angel sing 
A-coming through! the rye, 
Mother may I

To root hog or die.

RUSTIC DAMSEL. 
Written by W ALTER HOWARD, sung by BILLY W EST. 
A long time to come, I 
remember it well, 
All alone in the workhouse this beauty did dwell. 
With her father and mother she lived all serene ; 
Her age it was red and her hair was nineteen. 
Now she had a 
lover who close by did dwell, 
A bandy-backed Rustic and hump-backed as well; 
He said " fly with me now by the light of you star 
For you are the eye of my apple you aro." 
But this dutif ul maiden said gently " be wise," 
My father should scratch out my nails with his eyes. 
If you love me so you'll not bring me to disgrace 
Sobbed the maid as she buried her hand in his face. 
So, so she refused him. He knocked down this maid, 
She suddenly opened the knife with his blade, 
He next cut the throat of this damsel so fair. 
Then dragged her along by the head of the hair. 
Now just at this moment the old man appears. 
And he gazed on the sight with eyes in his tears, 
He knelt down beside her and her cold face he kissed 
Then rushed with his throat at the murderer's fist.

Though but sixteen, don't think I'm green, you'll be mistaken 
there, 
Though fresh from meadows yet I 
have no hayseed in my hair.

Because, I

good reason; I'm flying for higher 
game, and once more I 
beg of you to remember that— 
Though but sixteen, don't think me green, etc. 
The man I 
want must be six foot, and have a 
black mustache, 
A 
cluster pin, a 
diamond ring, and cut a 
military dash; 
He must have no faults of any kind, in fact, a 
perfect brick, 
And if there's such a 
one in front, he can't apply too quick. 
SPOIKEN.—I 
don't wish to be thought forward, but_business is 
business—and— 
Though but sixteen, don't think me green, etc.

THE CLAM MAN'S GAL. 
Banjo solo. Written by PHIL. H . 
M OWREY. Dedicated to Mr. Pzrz 
M ILLER, of Philadelphia, Penn. 
Oh, I'll sing to you of a 
nice young gal, 
Day called her Saris Jane, 
She fell in lab -a-id a 
clam•dealer, 
And Sammy was his name. 
He used to take her every wherea, 
And her he'd often treat, 
He went to see her every night, 
At her home io Lombard street. 
As Saria Jane walked out one day, 
All in the summer's heat, 
She met her dear young Sam-n-el, 
Wid auoder gal in the street; 
When Saria Jane she saw this, 
"Revenge I'll have," she said. 
So she went and stole a 
sweet-potato, 
And stabbed this Clam Man dead. 
When dis young gal Sam was walking wid, 
Saw clat he was no more, 
She rushed away wid all her might, 
Into a 
grocery store. 
Oh, there she seized a 
half of a 
cheess, 
Dat on de counter lied, 
She swallowed it down all at once, 
Gave up the ghost and died. 
When Saris Jane saw they were dead, 
She said she'd live no more, 
So she tried ta hang herself, 
By standing on Ler head on de floor. 
She soon found out, dat wouldn't do, 
So another way she tried, 
She jumped off her bed down on de door, 
Kicked out her foots and died. 
FAIR KATRINA, AND CARROTTY BEN. 
Written expressly for HARRY STANWOOD, by the late J. B. Munpar. 
On, list to me while I 
relate, 
The sad, untimely, cruel fate 
Of a 
galliant youth with carrotty hair, 
Who loved a 
German maiden fair. 
His name I 
cannot. mentu-en, 
But the neighbors called him Carrotty Ben 
And through the country far and wide, 
All knew Katrina Kroutzeuklyde. 
CHORUS. 
Then list to the mournful tale I 
tell 
Of a 
love-sick youth, what him befell, 
How false Katrina, fat. and fair, 
Deceived poor Ben with the carrotty hair. 
'Twas at a 
German plc-nic ball, 
That Carrotty Ben in love did fall, 
With the false Katrina, fat and fair, 
And waltzed and polka'd with her there, 
He told his love, and with a 
smile, 
She answered in Teutonic style : 
" 
Mine boy, I 
loves you, more as good," 
And so the matter was understood. 
So list, etc. 
Now Carrotty Ben without good sense, 
Rushed in and went to much expense ; 
He bought Katrina silks and rings, 
And lots of other curious things; 
But on the day they were to wed, 
She fell down stairs and broke her head; 
Then Carrotty Ben he felt so queer, 
He drank a 
barrel of lager beer. 
Then list, etc. 
Now Carrotty Ben resolved to die, 
So he built a 
balloon and soared so high ; 
Then out he jumped with a 
fearful lurch, 
And fell on the spire of a 
country church. 
The steeple run him through and through,  
And be sticks there still where all can view ; 
The sun has dried him very plain, 
And they use him now for a 
weather-vane. 
CHORUS. 
Now this was the tale i 
had to tell 
Of Carrotty Ben, what him befell; 
So lovyers all whatever you do. 
Beware the wiles of a 
German Jew.

W HAT is home without a 
wife 
To cheer our lonely way 7 
What is home without a 
babe 
To bless us day by day ? 
Who would miss a 
mother's smile, 
The best the world e'er saw ? 
But what is home, 
Ah, what is home, without a 
mother-in-law ? 
SpoREN.--Before I 
was married I 
knew nothing about it, but 
now, ah! alas !— 
CHORUS. 
Oh, that man to joy is dead— 
Naught his gladness can restore— 
If he's to an orphan wed, 
And has no mother-in-law! 
Home is sweet when full of love, 
Tho' poor that home may be; 
Go and search the wide world o'er, 
No dearer place we see; , 
When in distant lands we roam, 
'Tis cherished more and more, 
And then it is we sigh for her— 
Our own dear mother-in-law! 
SPOKEN.—I 
really do " cherish my home," but under the cir-
cumstances " more roaming and less sighing " would greatly in-
crease the " cherish," because— 
Oh, that man, etc. 
Who doth watch our every step 
With never-tiring eye ? 
Who will chide each little fault 
With many a 
weary sigh ? 
Who can make our cottage blessed 
As Eden was of yore ? 
Our wives are fond, but what•is home 
Without a 
mother-in-law ? 
SPOKEN.—Of 
course I 
can " go " a 
little watching and chid-
ing, but. as for my 
cottage being blessed," you will agree with 
me in saying— 
Oh, that man, etc. 
WHAT IS HOME WITHOUT A MOTHER-(IN-
LAW) ?—Continued. 
Sweet her kind endearing smiles, 
Like sunshine after rain; 
Sweet her oft bestowed advice 
That charms the heart from pain; 
Bless the dear old party's curls, 
And never-ending jaw; 
No peasant home should be without— 
Without a 
mother-in-law. 
SPOKEN.— M y 
fortunate friends, it is not for me to expatiate 
upon her noble qualities of heart and mind. 
I 
leave it for oth-
ers to enlarge upon the subject, and simply reply to this con-
undrum, " Get one for yourself," for— 
Oh, that man, etc.

W HAT is home without a 
wife 7 
'Tis her smiles that make home dear; 
All is lost when her sweet life 
Departs, with many a 
bitter tear I 
My early love is in the grave, 
My home once bright is so no more; 
Above her now the willows wave, 
And naught can e'er my joy restore! 
What is home without a 
wife ? 
'Tis her smiles that make home dear; 
All is lost when her sweet life 
Departs, with many a 
bitter tear! 
She was like a 
sunny beam, 
All the world she was to me! 
Life it was a 
blissful dream; 
'Tis now a 
weary and troubled sea! 
I 
long to clasp her to my heart 
In yonder radiant home above; 
There every sorrow shall depart, 
And be forgot in joy or love. 
What is home without a 
wife ? 
'Tis her smiles that make home dear; 
All is lost when her sweet life 
Departs, with many a 
bitter tear!

sweeter far than moon or star, Whilst court-ing in the rain. 
The rain poured down alarmingly, 
When to a 
tree we came, 
And shelter took beneath it, 
There I 
quickly learned her name. 
She also told me where she lived, 
With pa down at the farm; 
A farmer's daughter l 
well, said I, 
That is an extra charm. 
Spoken.—I 
glory in country life, and a 
farmer's daughter, what could be 
batter; I 
wieled the rain would keep on as I 
rather liked— 
Courting in the rain, 4&e. 
At length the rain abated, 
And the sun shone out quite bright, 
And the little birds began to sing, 
My heart it felt so light. 
I 
gently press'd her arm in mine, 
And said now don't say " nay," 
But let me come and meet you here 
Again some other day. 
Bpoken.—Well, she said, I 
can't exactly decide, you mud ask my pa. Ve 
I 
made up my mind to go, and inform the old gentleman we'd been— 
Courting in the rain, & c. 
We reaeh'd the old farm-house, and that 
She introduced to me 
Her pa, a 
jolly nice old boy, 
With him I 
made quite free. 
I 
told him when and where I'd met 
His daughter in the rain, 
And bless'd the lucky chance that took 
Me down that country lane. 
Spoken.—The old gentleman was quite delighted with my kind stem. 
%on, and I 
500D gaind his consent, which proves the truth of the old 
jecryerb," It never rains but it pours ;" and so it occurred to me, thiough—

THE LESS I SAY OF IT, 
TTTP, BETTER. 
Written and sung by Gus Wrmums. 
Ara.—" 
It's wonderful how we do it, but we do." 
NEW songs will come around, 
As new subjects they abound, 
And the one I've got, I 
think is just the cheese, too, 
And if it makes a 
hit, 
Why then, I 
don't care a 
bit, 
For my object is for to sing and to please you. 
It's a 
saying, by the way, 
That you hear every day, 
And sometimes you may read it in a 
letter; 
So with no more preface, 
I 
will introduce my case— 
For, I 
think the less I 
say of it, the better. 
A 
young man in the street, 
A 
pretty girl does meet, 
And introduces himself by sweet talking; 
She thinks he is so nice, 
For he talks as smooth as ice 
To her, as along the street they're walking; 
And not long after that, 
She's got on a 
new hat, 
And way up town we find that he has met her; 
And when it does get dark, 
They walk into the park— 
Wall, I 
think the less I 
say of it the better. 
I've been idle just a 
year, 
And I'm feeling rr,ther queer, 
As to where I'm going for to raise some money; 
For it's true, upon my life, 
I've got a 
darling wife, 
And she can't live very long on love and honey ; 
But there's one thing so fine, 
We've no children so divine, 
So poverty it don't seem such a 
fetter. 
But on this you may rely, 
There will come some by- and-bye— 
Well, I 
think the less I 
say of it the better.

And protect her only boy.

DANCING in the dreamy waltz, 
Beautiful, sweet, and dreamy waltz, 
As round and round, 
To sweet languid strains we whirl; 
Dancing in the dreamy waltz, 
Beautiful, sweet, and dreamy waltz— 
Oh! the joys of dancing 
In the dreamy waltz— 
Hearts all responsive 
To the music sweet— 
Bright eyes so joyous, 
Lightly tripping feet. 
Dancing in the dreamy waltz, 
Beautiful, sweet, and dreamy waltz, 
As round and round 
To sweet languid strains we whirl; 
Dancing in the dreamy waltz, 
Beautiful, sweet, and dreamy waltz! 
Oh, the joys of dancing 
In the dreamy waltz. 
Gliding in the dreamy waltz, 
Languid, sweet, delicious waltz, 
Clinging so fondly 
Close to some partner dear; 
Oh, the sweet and dreamy waltz, 
Best of all to me, the waltz— 
Sweet the joys of dancing 
In the dreamy waltz; 
Pleasures surround us, 
All around is bright, 
No gloomy shadow 
Dims our spirits light. 
Dancing in the dreamy waltz, etc.

SRELLTs 
M Y 
love is young and fair and sweet, 
My fancy she can please, 
But 0, she is inclined to flirt 
With every one she sees; 
when ever she goes out alone 
She's sure to catch a 
beau, 
But then she says it's all for fun, 
And thut's nO harm, you know. 
I 
want her to be mine, 
And oft I 
tell her so, 
But though she don't decline, 
She wont say yes or no. 
CHORUS.

You must go and ask papa, George, ha, ha! 
Her father is a 
gruff old man, 
With lots of worldly pelf— 
He says his charming daughter is 
A 
fortune in herself; 
In that, of course, we both agree, 
But when I 
speak about 
her hand and heart we have to part, 
For he coolly kicks me out! 
I 
see my love each day, 
She sayt it is a 
shame; 
What will we do ? I

Her answer is the same—

GO GET PERMISSION Or 1VIA. 
Ant.—" I 
fancy I've seen you before." 
I 
ONCE. had a 
sweetheart, a 
charming young girl,. 
A beautiful young village queen, 
A 
rustic young beauty with hair all in curl, 
And only just turned seventeen; 
When I 
told her I 
loved her, her head she bung down, 
And her cheeks colored up like the rose, 
So I 
thought I 
would try and just steal a 
sly kiss 
From the spot where her victuals all goes. 
SPOKEN.— And I 
did try, but she stopped me and said !-
CHORUS. 
You must go get permission of ma„ 
You must go get permission of ma, 
Before you attempt to do any such thing, 
You must go get permission of ma. 
While talking one night of what pleasure love brings, 
'Twas one pleasant evening in May, 
No dickey bird sailing through air on his wings 
E'er felt half so happy or gay, 
I 
asked my fair charmer if she would be mine, 
And begged she would then name the day 
When we should be married and settled for life, 
Just listen to what she did say: 
CHORUS. 
You must go, 
get permission of ma, 
You must go get permission of ma, 
Before we attempt to do. any such thing, 
You must go get permission of ma. 
Her ma did consent, and in one month from this 
Maria and I 
will be one; 
To my suit the old lady with pleasure said yes, 
Her consent it was easily won; 
":But you must agree,' said her mother to me 
"To what I 
am now about to say ; 
When married you calmly submit and agree 
To let us have all our own way." 
SPOKEN.— This quite stunned me for the moment; but re. 
covering myself, I 
coolly replied: 
CHORUS. 
_Oil must go get permission of ma, 
You must go get permission of ma, 
Before 1 
agree to do any such thing, 
You must go get permission of ma. 
(1) 
GO GET PERMISSION OF MA.— Concluded. 
A 
little advice to you girls I'll now give, 
So listen to what I 
shall say; 
When sweethearts want to marry, and with you to live, 
Don't say, " I 
must have my own way," 
If you do, as sure as I 
am singing to-night, 
Old maids I 
am certain you'll die, 
For a 
man's but a 
fool, if he doesn't tell you, 
Or rather unto you reply : 
CHORUS. 
You must go get permission of ma, 
You must go get permission of ma, 
Before I 
agree to do any such thing, 
You must go get permission of ma.

I'm in love with such a 
charming little man, 
A

And I 
love him better than gold or wealth, 
When I 
see him in his uniform so grand. 
The first time that I 
met him, 
With love I 
was struck dumb, 
And my heart was in a 
flutter, 
When Charlie played the drum.

When Charlie plays the drum. 
Oh! he often comes to take me for a 
walk, 
And we stray along tooether, side by side, 
And so sweetly and so lovingly he'll talk; 
And once he ask'd me if I'd be his bride. 
And ev'ry Thursday evening, 
As soon as work is done, 
I 
hasten to the park to hear 
My Charlie play the drum. 
And it's one, two, etc.

How loving we were! how cosy we'd chat 
'Bout one thing and Vother, and this thing, and that; 
With my arm round her waist, how cosy we sat, 
Like two little turtle doves perch'd on a 
tree; 
Such squeezing, and teasing, and pleasing we had, 
Such wooing, and cooing, to make our hearts glad; 
With laughing and chaffing I 
near drove her mad, 
But still she was awfully spooney on me: 
to 
SPOREN:—And if that Soldier would only have left us alone, she would never 
have exclaimed :—Cuonus, 
One night, for a 
change, we went to the Play, 
And when we got home she was awfully gay, 
She saw them make love, and so learn'd the way, 
The piece was " Claude Melnotte," and suited her fine; 
She call'd me her rose-bud, her duck, and her dear, 
She threw her arms round me, while fast fell each tear; 
She cried, oh, don't leave me, for sadly I 
fear 
You don't love me truly, say, will you be mine ? 
SPOKEN:—Just at that moment a 
Policeman passed and she said :—Csoara. 
Our courting days o'er, at last we were wed, 
I 
oft bless the hour when to church her I 
led, 
I 
now call her Mary, and she calls me Ned; 
We're happy and loving, and never know strife, 
We've a 
fine, handsome lass, and two noble boys, 
Trouble or sorrow ne'er us annoys; 
Of life we've the sweets, and while tasting its joys, 
I'm thankful, I'm bless'd with a 
good little wife. 
Bros:—And should an angry word rise to my lips, with a 
meek smile on 
her face she'll exclaim :—CHORIIS.

wife. 
Then, oh, dear, oh, 
Be f, ee, and frolic about; 
Let ladies try, but pipe your eye, 
When you're married, you'll find it out. 
A fellow he gets spooney 
On a 
girl that looks a 
queen. 
If he don't propose in a 
fortnight, 
She asks hitu what ho means; 
You must quickly marry me; 
She knows her way about, 
lie don't— he's green— he marries her, 
And then he tinds it out. 
Then, oh, dear, oh, ko. 
He takes his love down by the sea, 
To spend the honey moon; 
What should be honey, 
Always turns to cream of tartar soon. 
It's dear, oh, (lackey! oh, darling! 
For a 
week or thereabout; 
And then she makes it warm for him; 
When you're married, you'll flud it out. 
Then, oh, dear, oh, &o. 
He once was stout and hearty, 
lint now like me he's thin ; 
Perhaps his wife is tolerable, 
Perhaps she's fond of gin. 
I 
won't say which, but somehow 
His money it flies about, 
Till his uncle has to help him; 
It's then he finds it out. 
Then, oh, dear, oh I 
ezo. 
Then in half a 
dozen years, 
Around your table there : 
You count a 
dozen boys and girls, 
All yours— it makes you stare. 
If they ain't, you have to keep the lot, 
Perhaps yon'Ve got the gout; 
The boys won't work, the girls don't want, 
When you're married, you'll find it out. 
Then, oh, dear, oh I&o. 
HAPPY GO LUCKY AM L 
We 
never can tell what the weather will be, 
In this climate of ours; 
In the morn a 
bright sun in a 
blue sky we see, 
in the afternoon probably showers. 
Time alone unfolds the curtains, 
But one -satisfaction we gain; 
If raining, ' tis equally certain 
'Twill soon be sunshiny again

That for care I've had my share, 
Of trouble I 
don't deny ( not a 
bit of it a 
Grief's a 
bo e, I'll fret no more, 
happy go lucky am I. 
Half of the troubles our fancies have raised, 
To maturity never arrived; 
And much that in anticipation we pr:.-ds'd, 
When it came was of pleasure deprived. 
All our enjoyments are fleeting, 
And nought so uncertain as wealth; 
Though nothing so badly we're treating, 
There's nothing in value like health. 
That for care, bal. 
'Tis very unpleasant to find we're in debt, 
For we're always in danger and doubt; 
It little avails like starting to fret, 
And cry only " I 
cannot get out;" 
Creditor ceases believing, 
Prospects of payment grow dim; 
But if one of the two must be grieving, 
I 
think I 
had better let him. 
That for care, fite. 
If you keep out of debt you can't keep out of love. 
No matter however you try; 
riro heart that beat yet could impregnable prove, 
To the arrows which Cupid lets fly. 
lirerciless tyrant is Cupid, 
Though but a 
pigmy in size; 
Ills cleverest victim turns stupid, 
And loses the use of both eyes. 
That for care. &o. 
In love or in debt we should keep on at work, 
Although we are not bound to sncoeed; 
Lint with nothing to do when in debt and love too, 
We'll have but a 
poor time indeed. 
Labor unceasing is galling, 
Laziness cannot be rest; 
Whatever our station or calling. 
Keep moving, ' tis all for the best..

I 
fell in love with a 
pretty girl, 
A few shot t 
years ago. 
All sorts of weather, hail or rain, 
To court her I 
would go ; 
I'd long and sigh Ns ith love until 
'Twas time to be a,

And when I 
asked a 
parting kiss, 
She always used to say: 
CHORUS. 
Oh. mother says I

Oh, George. please. George, not just yet awhile; 
Mother says I

Oh, George, don't, George, not just yet. 
I waiting" kept, at last, one day, 
I 
thought I'd know my fate, 
I 
sunk upon my knees in quite 
An agonizing state ; 
" 
Selina, say you'll have your C4orge, 
And when shall we be wed ?" 
I 
longed to hear my love's reply, 
And this is what she said— 
Spoken—Well, George, dear, you're very lrAud, ho+. we could never 
live on two hundred a 
year , so until you are worth at least tire 
hundred per annum, darling— 
Mother says I 
caustn't, dze. 
From then I 
went to work, by Jove! 
I 
left no stone unturned. 
Until five hundred pounds a 
year. 
At last I 
really earned ; 
Selina heard how things had chatted, 
And when we met o . e 
day, 
Sbe seemed .to p'easant, and at last 
She lovingly did say—

DARLING BIINIONETTE. 
You may talk about your fascinating beauties, 
Your fashionable blondes and pretty belles; 
But the subject of my song I'm going to sing your 
Is par excellence the queen of all the swells. 
We met, 'twas in a 
crowd and then we parted; 
The beauty of her face I 
will ne'er forget, 
As she never told her name I 
cannot tell it: 
But I 
have christened her my Darling Minionetta. 
CHORUS 
She is sweeter than the flowers I 
name her afber, 
And the memory of her beauty haunts me yet. 
There is a 
band of opera music in her laughter, 
You will know her she in my Darling Minionette 
She looked at me, a 
glance was all I 
wanted, 
As I 
followed her along the crowded street, 
And my memory with her loveliness was haunted, 
As she tripped so lightly on those fairy feet. 
The second time she cast her eye upon me, 
She smiled on me and then a 
moment more, 
She rang the bell and faded from my vision, 
Then all was dull, for she was there no more. 
She is sweeter, Ike. 
Next day in hopes to see my little darling, 
I 
sought the house, 'twas No. ninety four, 
When the poodle in the house commenced a 
snarling, 
And barking loudly chased me from the door, 
I 
ran along the street and he ran after, 
And with his teeth he seized my pantaloons. 
He hung on while the crowd convulsed with laughter. 
Cried that's the chap that stole the silver spoons. 
She is sweeter. am

SPARKING SUNDAY NIGHT. 
Sitting in a 
corner, on a 
Sunday eve, 
With a 
taper finger resting on your sleeve 
Starlight eyes are casting on your face their light. 
Bless, me, this is pleasant—Sparking Sunday night. 
CHORUS. 
Bless me, ain't it pleasant, 
Bless me) ain't it pleasant 
Bless me, ain't it pleasant, 
Sparking Sunday night? 
How your heart is thumping, 'gainst your Sunday vest., 
How wickedly 
working, on this day of rest; 
Hours seem but minutes, as they take their flight : 
Bless me ain't it pleasant—sparking Sunday night? 
Bless me, dye. 
Dad and Mem are sleeping, on tneir peaceful bed, 
Dreaming of the things the folks in meeting said, 
"Love ye one another," Ministers recite ; 
Bless me, don't we do it—sparking Sunday night ? 
Bless me, &c. 
One arm with gentle pressure lingers round her waist, 
You squeeze her dimpled hand, her pouting lips you taste; 
She freely slaps your face, but more in love than spite, 
Oh, thunder I 
ain't it pleasant—sparking Sunday night 
Bless me, Arc. 
But hark! the clock is striking, it is two o'clock I 
mum, 
As sure as I'm a 
sinner, the time to go has come, 
You ask with spiteful accents if " that old clock is right,P 
And wonder if it ever—sparked on Sunday night ? 
Bless me, drc. 
One, two, three sweet kisses—four, five, six, yon hook— 
But thinking that you rob her, give back those you took; 
Then, as for home you hurry, from the fair one's sight, 
Don't you wish each day was only Sunday night ? 
Mow me, elm

SHE WAS"JUST ABOUT THE AGE.--(0oNcLonan› 
She lived a 
little way from town, it wasn't very far, 
And with her dwelt a 
cross old man although be was her pa; 
One day when her papa was out I 
went to her's to dine, 
And in my pocket for a 
treat, I 
took a 
quart of wine. 
For she liked wine, she would you know, she would you know, shc 
would, 
But then, of course, she would you know, she was just about the rize 
We sat and talked a 
little while, and after we had dined, 
I 
for a 
little drop of wine felt mightily inclined, 
When a 
rat- tat we heard at the door, and she to me did rush, 
And pushed me in the cupboard, and 'twits then I 
saw her blush. 
But then, of course, she would you know, she would you know, she 
would, 
But then, of course, she would you know, she was just about the age 
Her father then came in, and talked for half an hour or more, 
And she sat leaning alt the while against the cupboard door, 
When the wine-flask in my pocket broke and made a 
precious mess, 
Ran underneath the cupboard doer, all round her new silk dress. 
For she wore silk, she would you know, she would you know, she 
would, 
But then, of course, she would you know, she was just about the age. 
Her father saw the flowing wine, and said. Sarah, what is that!" 
She said. " Some jam and pickle jars are broken by the cat ," 
lie opened then the cupboard door, exclaiming, " Who are you r 
And I 
was in a 
pickle, in a 
jam, and in a 
stew. 
The old man swore he would you know, he would you know, he 
would, 
But then, of course, he would you know, he was just about the age. 
He pulled me out and punched my head, then with good humor he, 
On hearing I 
was not bad off, invited me to tea; 
Since then I've married Sarah Green, and pleased I 
am to see, 
That she and all our little ones quite happy seem to be. 
But then, of course, she would you know, she would you know, she

THE SWELL WITH A GLASS IN HIS EYE. 
How do you do, " my dear" boys—how do you do, 
You're looking remarkably well; 
No doubt you have met me before— 
'Twas at Long Branch, Broadway, or Palmall. 
By Jove you don't seem to remember, 
But you'll recollect me " by the by ;" 
By respectable people I'm known 
As the swell with a 
glass in his eye. 
CHORUS. 
For it gives a 
distinguished appearance, 
And as I 
go sauntering by; 
The darlings all sigh as though they would die 
For the swell with a 
glass in his eye. 
Some people delight in a 
moustache, 
And make it stick out like a 
pole; 
Some have their weakness on whiskers, 
But mine wouldn't grow 'pon my soul. 
Some people like the opera--
Roman Fall, but I. bye the bye; 
Contented with my natural charms, 
As a 
swell with a 
glass in his e,ve. 
For it era, dre. 
Some say can 1 
see any better, 
No, by Jove, I 
can't see half as well; 
My sight is as good as most folks,

It makes a

THE PURTY GAL SELLING HOT-CORN. 
Come list one and all to my ditty, 
I'll tell you of a 
sorrowful tale, 
And if you've a 
morsel of pity, 
Your tears will flow down by the pail; 
Its concerning a 
damsel called Sally, 
Such a 
pnrty gal never was born, 
She in Laurens Street lived in an alley, 
This purty gal selling Hot-corn. 
Her love to one Reiley was given, 
Who clams round the town peddled he, 
He used to sell fish for a 
living, 
And he was no ways selfish you see, 
But he 'listed to go tor a 
soger, 
And he left his poor Sal all forlorn, 
She in West Broadway lived in an alley, 
This purty gal selling hot corn. 
He was stationed outside of a 
city, 
Where one day picket duty he tried, 
He was bit by an orful muskeeteer, 
He swelled up, then bursted and died, 
Far away from this damsel called Sally. 
For Reiley every night she would mourn, 
She in Thomas Street lived in an alley. 
This purty gal selling hot corn. 
Every morning she'd sit in the alley 
Where she used for to sigh and to sob 
Till a 
hot corn she tried for to swallow, 
But she choked herself dead with the cob, 
That's the last of the damsel called Sally, 
For Reiley had left her forlorn, 
She in Wooster Street lived in an alley, 
This purty gal selling hot corn.

A party came and took that room, 
Whom I

A sanctimonious sort of chap, 
Whose uaine was Brother Flarn ; 
He was a

Or, New Jerusalam. 
Cruel Jane Jemima, 
Left her taxiing Sam ; 
She's gone to be a

In New Jerusalain—oh, dear iine! 
He'd hold forth on the joys of being 
A 
blissful Mormonite 
While Jane Jemima listen'd to 
His words with great delight. - 
He told us, 0 
such glorious things. 
Did pious Brother Flaw ; 
That we thought no place could ewer equal 
New Jer;:salam. 
cruel Jane, it 
He told us how each happy Saint, 
Had lots of happy wives ; 
I 
thought they'd tight, but, oh, dear r‘c 
They led such happy lives. 
Tney liv'd on turtle, duck and green p.us, 
Fricassed fruit and " Ci am 1"

TIECIAGS A YOUNG LADY WEARS. 
Being short now of a 
subject, on which to find a 
song: 
I've hit upon the happy thought, to pass the time along 
111 sing about the articles that a 
young lady wears, 
From balmorals and waterfalls to patent curls and hair 
CHORUS. 
So if you listen while I 
sing, 
And on my words give heed, 
You will find out all the articles 
That a 
young lady needs. 
She first of all must have a 
rat and a 
silk net bag 
To put her hair in afterwards, or wound upon a 
rag, 
She then must have a 
pair of stays, to show off her frock-cost, 
An elevator she must have, to show her petticoat. 
So if you listen, &c. 
She needs some patent plumpers then, if she's got hollow cheeks. 
And if she's aged she will need a 
set of false frcnt teeth, 
She needs a 
May Queen for the Spring, a 
jockey hat for Fall, 
EL 
bonnet, too, without a 
cape, to show her waterfall. 
So if you listen, & c. 
With brass pins, ear-rings, belt and finger rings so fine, 
With tooth brush, fancy soap, hairpins, net, combs and crinoline. 
So timid were our women once, they would frighten at a 
mouse, 
But since they've got to wearing hoops, there's a 
skeleton in 
every house. 
So if you listen, &c. 
A en;ly net and beau catcher, comes next upon my list, 
No doubt there's many an article, that in my song I've missed. 
If I 
should try to name them all, the ladies would feel vexed, 
So what I 
have left out to-night, I'll continue in my next. 
So if you listen, cite.

BEAUTIFUL GIRLS. 
As sung by Gus W ILLIAMS. 
THEY talk about their foreign girls, 
How beautiful they are, 
And how they dress, and all that thing, 
But for that I 
don't care; 
The girls I 
love are Yankee girls; 
I 
see them every day; 
They're plain, I 
own, but then they have 
A 
nice and winning way. 
SPOKEN --Yes, indeed. 
I 
needn't go out of the United States 
to find— 
Cfloaus.—Beautiful girls, beautiful girls, 
Saucy, teasing, pleasing girls; 
I 
love one and all, both great and small, 
Beautiful, beautiful girls. 
It's nice, when it is winter time, 
To go upon the road 
In a 
nice sleigh, a 
pretty girl 
'Long side of you is stowed; 
And how the people they will look, 
And wonder who she is; 
But you drive on, and never mind, 
Because it's not their " biz." 
SPOKEN.—It's the nicest thing in winter to have a 
pretty girl 
out sleighing. 
You stop at a 
hotel, and ask her what she will 
have to drink. 
She says ( very meekly), " Wine." " What 
kind—port or sherry 7" 
She says, " Champagne." 
Now, im-
agine treating to champagne and only a 
dollar in you pocket— 
and that always happens when you take out riding— 
Beautiful girls, etc. 
And when the summer comes around, 
To pic-nics you do go, 
And to enjoy yourself, while there, 
You ask along your beau. 
The day is tine, the music, too, 
And birds sing from each tree, 
And with a 
charming, nice young girl, 
How happy one must be! 
SPOKEN.—At a 
pic-nic a 
man can always enjoy himself, if he 
has a 
pretty girl with him. 
How nice it is to eat lunch with 
her that she has prepared with her delicate hands! 
How nice 
it is to get into a. swing with her, and then to wander off in the 
woods alone! 
You get on your knees, and tell her you will 
lore her as long as life lasts, and ask her to be your wife. 
She 
consents. 
You then get up, and find a 
lot of mud and oyster-
shells all over your knees; and all that comes &oat making 
love to— 
Beautifal girls, etc. 
55 
IT'S leuxyza WITEN YOU FEEL THAT WAY. 
As sung by Gus W ILLIAMS. 
SHAN 'T forget how queer I 
felt when first I 
fell in love, 
I 
had a 
most severe attack through squeezing a 
lady's glove. 
Her lovely hand was in it as I 
danced with her so gay, 
I 
thought myself in paradise—it's funny when you feel that 
way. 
CHOUIIS, 
I 
felt as tho' I'd tumbled into honey, and some one had left me 
all their money. 
The feeling's so peculiar and funny, it's funny when you feel 
that way. 
I 
took her down to supper, and sat down by her side, 
I 
helped her to the ices, and filled her glass with pride, 
In fact paid such attention, that she viewed me with dismay, 
I 
moved my chair so close to hers, it's funny when you feel that. 
way. 
I 
felt as tho', etc. 
'We met again cue afternoon, and as we were alone, 
I 
plucked up nerve to ask her if some day she'd be my own; 
She blushed and said, go see papa and ask him if I 
may, 
I 
danced the cancan round the room, it's funny when you feel 
that way. 
I 
felt as tho', etc. 
The old man said that we might wed and so he crowned our 
bliss, 
And I 
shall be a 
married man in about a

BEAUTIFUL LOVE. 
As sung by Gus W ILIJAMS. 
LOVE, love, oh, what is love 3 
love, 'tis that makes man feel it, 
peculiar: 
Oh, love, who does not love a 
Maud, a 
Matilda, a 
Jane or a 
Julia 7 
Love it is, and love alone, that makes the world go round and 
round, 
Love is certain to be known, where a 
woman's to be found. 
When one has the Vrst attack it's like raspberry jam, running 
down ones back. 
CTIORUS. 
Oh, love, beautiful love, lore if. is that makes a 
man feel so pecu 
liar. 
Oh, love, beautiful love, a 
man' 
t• but a 
fool when he falls in love. 
Oh, love, when you're in love, te presents, to parties and picnics 
you treat her, 
Oh, love, just squeeze her glove, and you feel just as tho' you'd 
like to eat her; 
But the best of loves must part—then an 4nd comes to your 
bliss, 
You press the dear one to your heart and take from her the 
parting kiss, 
You bid her good-bye at the door with another sly kiss and two 
or three more. 
Oh, love, etc. 
Oh lore, when you're in love every half hour you'd go to court 
her. 
But oh, love, if she won't love, you talk about drowning yourself 
in cold water '•  
If it's all right she'll giggle and say, please ask father if I 
may, 
Then you feel so jolly and gay, and tease her till she names the 
day, 
You'll serenade her when she's abed and her dad drops flower-
pots on your head. 
Oh love, etc. 
Oh love, when you've your love out, all the money you have 
you must ladle, 
Servants, dresses, parties, and balls, perhaps eacb year a 
cherub 
to lay in the cradle. 
When the honeymoon is past then your eyes are not so blind, 
Your dream was far too good to last and your face grows long 
to find, 
Your looked- for happiness begins with a mother-in-law and 
beautiful twins. 
Oh love, etc. 
SOMEBODY'S BEEN DERE BEFORE. 
Written, composed and sung by Gus WILLIAlm. 
I

Und I'll tole vy I

Und dot somebody's been dere before.

THE MARBLE ARCH. 
As I 
strayed beneath a 
marble arch, one evening in July, 
A 
maiden fair, with golden hair, came gently tripping by; 
The lustre of her diamond eye, shone on me like a 
torch, 
And in a 
whisper soft she said, is this the marble arch 1 
CH011.17S. 
Then round her lovely form I 
drew my magic circle, 
I 
pressed her, I 
caressed her, my brain was in a 
whirl ; 
Around her lovely form I 
drew my magic circle, 
I 
kissed her and I 
called her a 
very pretty girl. 
I 
took her to a 
shady spot beneath the spreading trees, 
I 
took hold of her lily-white hand, and fell down on my knees, 
Beloved, cried I, arise, said she, and before 1 
had time to speak 
She imprinted one burning kiss upon my blooming cheek. 
Then round her lovely form, etc. 
Good-night, says she, in a 
voice so sweet, and gently squeezed 
my hand, 
/sly knees began to knock and shake, for I 
could scarcely 
stand ; 
We'll meet again some other night, and then prepare to march, 
But where, cried I, she then replied, beneath that marble arch. 
Then round her lovely form, etc. 
however, since that fatal night, I 
have not seen my queen, 
But I've beard them say she's run away with a 
big fat horse 
marine ; 
A 
ring I'll give her when we meet, but not as you suppose, 
I'll never put it on her hand, I'll stick it through her nose. 
Then round her lovely, etc.
