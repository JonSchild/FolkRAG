his earliest childhood singing and dancing came to him as 
a 
gift of Nature, and so marked was his abilities in that di-
restion that his fellow-citizens appreciating his premature

Young in years he entered the professiom 
and made extensive travelling tours throughout the United 
?States, with the most famous and select Companies, gain-
() 
ing the most flattering praises from the press of Loth

SONG' OF JOKES. 
AS I 
walked through the town one pleasant night in spring, 
I 
stood 'neath the windows to hear the girls sing; 
Oh where and oh where, has my highland laddie gone 
lie's gone, he's gone, as meek as any lamb, 
They took him, yes, they took him to the arms of Abraham; 
Away, away, away down south in Dixie, 
Where the troops are the finest I 
ever did see, 
And the captain with his whiskers, took a 
sly glance at 
Johnny Schmoker, Johnny Schmoker, etc. 
Oh I 
heard the drum beat and the music so sweet, 
But my eyes at the time caught a 
much better treat, 
For gay and happy, gay and happy, 
We'll be gay and happy still, 
Glory, glory, hallelujah, as we go marching on 
Oh Sallie come up, 
Sallie come down Sallie come down to 
3daryland, my Maryland, Maryland, my Maryland, 
For hast thou no feeling to see the kneeling with 
No one to love, none to caress, 
Roaming alone thro' this world's wilderness, 
Oh how can I 
leave thee, how can I 
break apart, 
When sheepskin and beeswax make an awful plaster, 
The more you try to take it off, 
A few days, a 
few days, 
What's the use of sighing, I'm going home, 
To the land of the free and the home of the girl I 
left behind hits 
The girl I 
left behind me. 
WHY AIN'T ' YOU FLY LIKE ME ? 
Written by T. M. TIFNGLER. 
Oh, here I 
am, a 
confidence gent, 
One of defrauding stamp 1

I 
flatter myself I'm a 
rogue, 
A 
perfect swindling scamp. 
I 
always start benevolent funs 
And shout at every hall. 
Oh, I 
run loan offices. hospital clubs, 
And finally swindle theLii all. 
Cuotrus. 
A 
good job too serves them right, 
It ain't my fault, they ought to know better; 
A good job too, it serves them right, 
Why ain't they fly like me. 
(Repeat) 
All enterprises I 
work up, 
And companies I 
promote, 
I 
get away with all the funds 
And. then they go afloat, 
I 
run for office every year, 
I 
surely make it tell ; 
Oh ! if I 
get in, for money, then, 
My party I 
will sell. 
A 
good job too, &o.. 
I 
borrow money every day, 
With it I 
speculate. 
I 
make my friends imagine that 
I 
own a 
large estate; 
If I 
invest and then I 
lose, 
They all commence to bawl; 
Oh, the bankrupt act I 
quickly take, 
And then they lose it all.

I 
know a 
little maiden 
air and young, 
'I he sweetest little cregrare in the village, 
Her face is like a 
garden of flowere. new sprung, 
And she lives within a 
rustic little cottage. 
There may be maidens just as fair, 
With the same bright winning ways; 
But none with eyes so lovely, 
Such a 
sweet bewitching gaze. 
Oh, yes, she is a beauty, so loving kind and true, 
And the only girl to suit me. 
With her laughing eyes of blue. 
That's why I'm always happy, light and gay, 
Because, you see my heart with love is laden; 
Cupid came and drove dull care away, 
The day I 
met this pretty little maiden. 
I 
know she loves me dearly. (symph.) 
Her actions prove it clearly. ( " )

That's why I'm always happy, light and gay, 
Because, you see, my heart with love is laden; 
Cupid came and drove dull care away 
The day I 
met this pretty little maiden. 
One day, while we were walking side by side, 
I 
never shall forget the look she gave me; 
1 
was when I 
asked her would she be my bride ? 
She smiling said, of course if you will have me, 
Then threw her arms around my neck— 
Which I 
took not amiss, and in that happy momect, 
You might have heard a 
kiss. 
Oh yes, she loves me dearly. and I 
love her the same; 
While her actions prove it clearly 
That she'd like to change her name. 
So there will be a 
wedding some fine day, 
And you will hear the merry bells a 
ringing; 
We'll live out in the couniry in grand array, 
In a 
flow of joy we'll dwell—to birds a 
singing. 
I

I

I'm here to tell to you 
Ilxv I 
fell in love, one night last week-, 
With a 
charming girl in blue. 
'Twas at a

Wuere mirth and joy did reign.

Gipsey Queen, 
While I 
was King of Spain. 
You ought to see her dancing, ( symph.) 
Her pretty little dark eyes glancing 
So lovingly on me. 
Clioars. 
Oh, she tilled my heart with sunshine, 
That rippled thro' hair. 
I'll never find, in all this world, 
Another girl so fair. 
Oh, my heart went pit-a-pat. 
When first I 
led her to to the dance, 
'Her little hand was held in mine ; 
How could I 
lose the chance 
To ask if I 
might see her home, 
When e'er she choose to go. 
I 
really thought that I 
would die 
If she should answer no; 
But then she looked so smiling, 
Her pretty little ways beguiling, 
As she said, yes, to me. 
Oh, she filled my heart, &c. 
The stars were shining brightly in the sky, 
As I 
walked by her side; 
I 
whispered all my love—ple,L.1 
That she would be my brid, : 
Of course, I 
hate to tell you. ht:re, 
The answer she

But if you'll all beirleased to call, 
We'll have —ou stay to tea.

SONG AND DANCE. 
Sung by T. M. HENGLER. 
As I 
strolled out one evening, 
'1 he sun had just gone i 
own ; 
While pleasantly meandering 
A 
little way from town, 
I 
then beheld a 
damsel 
With eyes the brightest blue 4, 
Beneath her dark eyelashes, 
Like violets dipped in dew. 
CHORUS. 
She smiled so sweet upon me, (sym)11.) 
That moment she had won me, 
"fw as love the fint I 
knew. 
There some sweet charm entrancing, 
With this dear girl so fair, 
A 
rosy, soft expression, 
With a 
mass of Golden Hair. 
Now, I 
followed on behind her, 
I 
think shco knew it well, 
And as a 
sweet reminder, 
Her handkerchief it fell ; 
I 
raised the scented linen 
From off tha grassy ground ; 
Her name, in letters crimson, 
On one corner then I 
found. 
Chorus. 
At length I 
did approach her, 
And ventured in the task, 
By asking her permission 
To join her lonely walk; 
She blushing, frowning, smiling, 
Said, ! I 
think -you rude, 
But those blue eyes, ik 
gulling, 
Seemed to say, I 
Ns7§h you would.

THE WAY OF THE WORLD!

Words by JOLLY NASH. 
I've seen a 
great deal of the world in my time, 
I've mixed with the grave and the gay, 
And rye noted the ways of the poor, and the proud, 
As I've journey'd thro' life's rugged way ; 
I've seen a 
good man at a 
turn of the wheel, 
By dame fortune to poverty hurrd, 
And I 
have seen those he fed in his prosperous days, 
Pass him by—that's the way of the world. 
Oh yes! its the way of the world, my boys, 
It's the way of the world, you see ; 
Oh yes ! it's the way of the world, my boys, 
but it is not the way with me. 
It's the way of the world to lavish its wealth 
On those who don't nal it, we find ; 
To smile at the follies of those that are rich, 
And to their misdoings be blind ; 
Should poverty err it is quite the reverse, 
The smiles are all changed.

Your conduct will always be judged by your purse, 
You will find, in the world's ups and downs. 
Oh yes! it's the way, cto.

It's the way of the world to envy the man

Who'hy nis exertions may rise, 
And cant about luck, if he who have pluck, 
Succeed in the things that he tries ; 
Some people make mischief the rule of their lives— 
Keep the banner of discord unfurled— 
Make tools of the weak to gain their own ends, 
As they wriggle their way through the world. 
Oh yas ! it's the way, N. 
It's the way of a 
few in the world, I 
observe, 
To frown upon all who are gay; 
And pull a 
long face when innocent mirth 
Would chase the dull moment away ;-
I 
have learnt some good lessons by what I 
have S•011— 
It is better to laugh than to cry— 
That much good is mixed with the had io the world, 
And each on himself should rely. 
Caortus. 
I've shewn you the ways of the world, my boys, 
The ways of the world, you see; 
Take the good with the bad, together, my boys, 
That is the way with me.

In his button-hole he wears a 
rose, 
He can Francais vooley parley; 
His hair, in Auburn ringlets, 
His eyes an azure dark ; 
The girls they call him Birdie, 
Like the Swallows in the Park.

Under his silk umbrello; 
His boots are patent leather; 
He never pays his bills— 
He always drinks plain soda— 
And eats up toothpic quills. 
Au Revoir! Au Revoir! 
You should hear him say; 
I

For Clanville, across the way ;

You ought to hear him sing Love's Chidings, 
On a 
Fogarty piano. 
Bye-Bey! Bye-Bey ! 
I

Before the bright Aurora 
Gills the Summer clouds so gay ; 
The ladies, Heaven bless 'em,

Their choicest little treasure, 
Is Hilderbrand Montrose.

Why cold to-day? once I

Then thy heart stirred, and flushed thy brow ; 
Never a 
word comes to me now— 
Now thy hand lies listless in mine ; 
Once its replies spake love divine ; 
Cold as if' we never had met ; 
Can it then be hear44 can forget ?

Speak to me, speak— 
Ile my heart heard, or it will break 
For one kind word ; 
No vows to bind, no pledge I 
seek, 
Only be kiud—sveak to me, speak. 
One idle day thou did'st deplore 
Some castaway on desert shore ; 
'Twits but a 
tale by poet feigned, 
'Yet thou did'st pale, silent and pained, 
And thou did'st moan, sad, sad to be 
Utterly lone by the bleak sea ; 
My life is drear, I, cast away— 
Give me the tear thou shed'st that day.

At the appointed time I

'Twas answered by my little Nell, 
Her blushing face at once did tell, 
Watching she had been for me. 
No longer could I 
conceal it, 
So I 
told her of my love, 
And vowed I 
would be true to her 
As the stars above. 
She said that she could love none else but me,

will married be 
To my dashing, gay brunette.

When I

And having nothing else to do 
I

But tightly to my arm sho clung,

To let her pass with care, 
To speak to her I

Oh what is the use of feeling sad, 
When there's lots of pretty girls, 
In this town yet to be had,

They told him, gen!ly she was gone, 
And spoke of Ileav'n and suall'd, 
And drew him from the lonely room, 
Where lay the lovely child. 
'Twas all in vain, he Leeded not 
Their pitying loo -:s 
of sorrow, 
" 
Hush !" hush !" he said, 
she only sleeps, 
She'll wake again to-morrow !" 
"Hush ! hush !" he said. 
she only sleeps, 
She'll wake again to-morrow !" 
They laid her in a 
lowly grave. 
Where winds blew high and bleak, 
Tho' the faintest summer breeze had seem'd 
Too rough to fan her cheek : 
And there the poor old man would watch, 
In strange and childish sorrow, 
And whisper to himself the words, 
" 
She'll come again to-morrow !" 
He'd whisper to himself the words, 
"She'll come again to-morrow !" 
One day they missed him long, and sought 
Where most he lov'd to stray, 
They found him dead upon the turf 
Where little Nelly lay : 
With tott'ring steps he'd wander'd there, 
Fresh hope and strength to borrow, 
And e'en in dying, breaths d 
the pray'r, 
"Oh! let her come to- morrow!' 
The old man, dying, breath'd the pray'r, 
" 
Oh ! let her come to-morrow !"

My buttonhole boquet, I 
wear it every day, 
Because it catches all the pretty girls, 
For when I'm out to walk I 
love to hear them talk, 
And see tharn toss their captivating curls. • 
Some say that I've got roguish eyes 
And quite a 
p'easing nose, 
While others fall in love at once 
With all my stylish clothes ; 
Again they'll say my black moustache 
Is nobby, neat and gay, 
But all are struck completely with 
My buttonhole boquet. 
By buttonhole boquet, 
Let others drink the best champagne 
And eat the richest game, 
Or let them drive about the town 
A

For I

On two fish balls a

Than promenade the streets without 
My buttonhole boquct.

BENEATH' THE GREENWOOD TREE.) 45 
Composed by J. W. MORTON. 
ONE pleasant noon I 
sallied forth, 
My darling one to meet, 
The glittering dew was on the leaves, 
And the sun was shining sweet, 
And as we stood within the glade, 
From noise and strife quite free, 
Near by we used to tell our love, 
Beneath the greenwood tree. 
C HORUS. 
Yes, indeed, I 
must confess 
On her depends my happiness, 
Elvira is a 
darling, 
And truly so to me, 
I'll ne'er forget where first we met, 
Beneath the greenwood tree. 
Her name it is Elvira Jane, 
That name sounds sweet to me, 
bly wife I 
intend to make this dear, 
If thus to me she'll be. 
As inerly moments they pass by, 
Her heart to judge is free, 
I've popped the question to my love, 
Beneath tha greenwood tree. 
She promised then to be mine, 
We've fixed the happy day, 
I 
shall take her to my heart, 
Just one week ncxt Sunday. 
Down in the little trysting place, 
Our wedding is to be, 
There where first we told our love, 
Beneath the greenwood tree.

them, with tremendous success, throughout the United States, 
OH, my heart is filled with sweet angelic rapture, 
Of a 
beauty fair I 
met the other day, 
Whilst in the Central Park a 
promenading, 
Lisrning to the band of music sweetly play ; 
Her pretty eyes with merry fun were flashing, 
Like clustering diamonds beneath her golden curls, 
Oh, my heart was gone the moment I 
beheld her, 
She's a 
queen when compared with other girls. 
CHORUS . 
She warbles sweeter than a 
bird,

Such melody I 
never heard, 
Sym. 
She's a 
fairy, is my Laughing Lilly Lindon ; 
And her royal beauty stole my heart away, 
Yet we often meet and wonder in the starlihgt, 
In the park to hear the band of music play. 
Now I'm lonoing for the happy times that's coming, 
When my Lilly dear and I 
are going to wed, 
You will hind when to her I 
introduce you, 
That there's more than truth in every word I 
said ; 
in a 
tiny fairy cottage by a 
streamlet, 
Well luxuriate 
little turtle dyes; 
I'll be more than happy when the wedding's over, 
For I'm the only darkie that she loves. 
She warbles sweeter than a

She is the prettiest, and the wittiest,

When first my arm she took, 
She's as pretty as a

And her voice is just the cage, where the little birde

She's the sweetest, and the neatest, 
She's as pretty as a

She's as pretty as a

THIS season now has opened bright,' 
For us to cut the wing, 
So let us now embrace this chance,

'Way off of this plantation, 
And show you tricks you never saw 
Before in all creation.

Oh 1 
I'm so jolly, 
And I'm in for folly, 
For we both wear the laurels now, 
And wilh them we will never part, 
To sit:g and dance Lere every night, 
Is just the object of my heart. 
We feel like falling on our heads, 
Our feet they seem so light, 
It's easy done if you know how, 
In it we take delight; 
For sensation now and novelty, 
Is all the rage and go, 
And if you'll notice us a

Observe this fact we know.

LOVELY and fair is my darling Patchoula, 
With eyes tender blue as mid summer's sky; 
She is my 
jewel, my heart's fondest treasure, 
The bloom on her cheeks will the roses outvie. 
She treats coldly my passionate ardor, 
Oh! its then that I 
love her the harder, 
Though she says on her life she'll ne'er be my wife 
Such a 
dear little witch is Patchoula. 
CHORUS. 
Oh! beautiful, bewitching Patchoula, 
My dear little riddle Patchoula, 
She can fool me at will but I'll think of her still, 
My witching, my darling Patchoula. 
When I 
first saw Patchoula one bright summer morning 
She stood by the side of her own father's gate, 
The smile that she gave me had the spell of a 
charmer; 
'Twas then that I 
knew I 
had met all my fate, 
With her manners so bewitching and simple, 
Her cheeks are so roguish and dimpled;

Where the murmuring waters flow, 
Birds there sing together,

A

Spotless, fair as a

In love's dream there I 
fel

Her lips are like the roses, 
Kissed by the morning dew; [Sycl 
She is my rustic beauty, 
To her I'll e'er be true. [Sym.]

first oeheld 
This lovely face and form, 
Which made me feel the dart,

She sat within a 
bower, 
Where birds did harmonize, 
Perfumed by every flower, 
Was this truly rurat 
Her lips, Sr.e. 
I'm as joyful as the birds, 
That warble in the trees, 
As they hop and l'Itnn on ,Thirrup, 
And fly where'er they piease,

Is to know I

base, calculating villains, an opportunity is afforded of

" 
An ingenious little book of the thaumaturgic order has 
been sent us called HUMPTY DUMPTY,' and bound in such a 
way as to give opportunity or a decidedly puzzling . rick. 
While presenting the ordinary appearance of a 
child's picture-
book ,._yly printed and colored, it is so bound that 
prac-
tised manip-1 tor taking it up and flirting the leaves rapidly 
over, can mak. t 
appear to be filled with copies of only one 
picture. or wi 
blank pages, or with any one of quite a 
suc-
cession of figures. 
One minute the p 
tmphlet, quickly thumb-
eu. appears to contain nothing but the portraits at Harlequin, 
in nis tesselated suit: the next, only Columbine, 
then, 
nothing but Paucaloon, or Riding Hood, or Mephistophiles. 
Alittle practice, and the direc ions printed with the book will

ENDORSEMENTS OF THE PRESS. 
The highest praise which can be given to this excellent 
elementary work on practical mechanics, consists in the fol-
lowing simple staieinent,of facts : The editor of thf4.journal, 
while teaching - 
riatubrphIlosophy anti cheriiiistry in the 
Cooper Institute from 1859 to 1864, was in need of a 
text-
book of practical mechanics, adapted to the advanced classes 
who had been trained in mathemalics; in his search among 
the many mechanical text- books, there was not one which so 
fully answered his requirements as the above work: It was 
therefore adopted and used with perfect satisfaction, and it 
is with pleasure that he receives it now as an old friend from,' . 
the publishers, gives it his most ea-nest recommendation, 
anti wishes it in the hands of all who are still in the fog b.hout 
thy units of work, calculation of the power of machinet'y, 
resistance to motion, strain on material, etc.—Manufacturer 
and Builder, July, 1874. 
he author of this work is well known as an extensive 
wiiter who has made some valuable additions to American 
technical literature, enuuuerated above in detail. 
The work 
we are now noticing is a 
theoretical treatise on practical me-
chanics, designed to supply a 
recognized deficiency. 
lidost 
of the works on mechaim.s treat the subject in a 
manner 
which is not available to young men commencing as appren-
tices in shops. 
Any young marl with a 
fair knowieoge of 
arithmetic may, however, use this work to great advantage ; 
it is not only suitable for a 
text- book, but also as a woik 
of reference. 
Most ambitious young men will make them-
selves so familiar with its contents as to be able to refer 
readily to any portion of the book. 
The author has adopted 
a 
new' notation to distinguish units of work from other units, 
which is not without vab- 
and might be advan t
ageous i
y 
introduced into more am tious works. 
The book is well 
printed on good white piiier.and bound in still cloth covers.
