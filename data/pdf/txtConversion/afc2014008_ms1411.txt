IT'S A LO"G WAY TO AMPHIOXUS  
C
 C
 
as sung by Sam Hinton
 
Oh, a fish-like thing appeared among the annelids one day
 
D7
 
6
1
 
It hadn't any parapods or setae to display
 
G
 jaws
 C
 
It hadn't any eyes or nwas or ventral nervous
 
D7
 
But it had
 
chord
 
G
 
a lot of gill slits and it had a notochord.
 
D7
 C
 G7
 C
 G
D7
 
It's a long way
 from Amphioxus; it's a long way to us
 
G
 D7
 C
 A7
 D7
 
It's a long way
 from Amphioxux to the meanest human cuss
 
G
 D7
 G
 G7
 
Then it's goodbye
 to fins and gill s
lits;  and it's
 
C
 B7
 
welcome lungs and hair
 
G
 CG
 A7
 D7
 G
 
It's a long, long way from A
xnphioxus but we all came  from there.
 
It wasn't much to look at and it scarce knew how to swim
 
And Verius was very sure it hadn't come from him
 
The molluscs wouldn't own it and the arthropods got sore
 
got the poor thing had to burrow d in the sand along the shore.
 
He burrowed in the sand before a crab did nip
 
And he said, "Gill s
lits and myotomes are all
 
I
've grown some metoplural folds and sport an
 
But all these fine new characters don't do me
 
his tail
 
to no avail;
 
oral hood,
 
any good."
 
He sulked a while down in the sand without a bit of pep
 
Then he stiffened up his notochord and said, "
I'll beat '
em yet,
 
Let '
em laugh and show their ignorance; I don't mind their jeers.
 
Just wait until they see me in a hundred million years V'
 
"My notochord shall change into a chain of vertebrae
 
And as fins my mal metoplural folds shall agitate the sea,
 
My tiny dorsal nervous chords shall be a mighty brain
 
And the vertebrates shall dominate the animal domain!"

iS I walked out in Laredo one day,
 
I sied a dear cowboy all wraoped in white line
 
Illiwra ped in white linen, as cold as the Ol3y
 
I see by your outfit that you are a cowboy
 
These words he did say as I boldly stooped by
 
Come s
it down beside me and hear my sad story,
 
I'm shot in the breast and I know I must die
 
Oh,
, once in the saddle, I used to go da
 sür;
 
Once in the saddle I used to go gay s 
First took to drinking and then to card-playin
 
Got shot in the breast and I'm dying today.
 
Oh beat the drum slowly and rattle the sours lowly
 
And give a wild whoop as you carry re along
 
Take me to the green valley and lay the sod o'er r
ue,
 
For I'm a young cowboy and I know I've done wron 0
 
Oh bring me a
 cup, a cup of cool water
 
To cool my parched lips, the cowboy then said,
 
But when I returned his soul had departed,
,
 
Gone up to his father s the cowboy was dead
 
v
ie beet the drum slowly and rattled the spurs lowly
 
And bitterly wept as we bore him along,
 
For we all loved our cowboy so brave,

We all loved our comrade although held doan  '
