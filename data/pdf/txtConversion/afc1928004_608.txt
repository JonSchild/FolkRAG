POOR OLD TRAMP, 
BH LEW BAKER. 
DEDICATED TO ADA BUBNETV. 
I've wandered all around, 
'Till I'm nearly broken down, 
And I 
have no place to rest my weary head, 
For to earn a 
scanty bite, 
I 
will work from day to night, 
And my response is hardship, scorn and bread. 
They will crush all my days, 
They will not let me raise, 
And they often call me scoundrel snare or scamp, 
All the worli will on me frown, 
They will always crush me down, 
Because I'm nothing but a 
poor old tramp. 
They say I 
am all right, 
If I 
must sleep out all night, 
And go hungry through the day and night: 
And they say I 
am well off, 
If I 
go and sell my clothes, 
Though they will not let me have a 
word to say. 
I 
do not look for pleasure, 
For that I 
do not treasure, 
But how my suffering heart begins to fail, 
And they tell me after all, 
That it's all my fault, 
That I'm nothing but a 
poor old tramp. 
If the poor will join their hands 
In one united band, 
This country from tyrants we'll defend; 
If capital does well, 
The poor may go to hell; 
For destruction it seems will be their end, 
And I 
think I'll see the day, 
And I 
hope they surely may, 
When the poor man will hold the brightest lamp, 
And his body in the clay, 
And his soul has passed. away, 
They can't term him as a 
poor old tramp..

OUR WORKINGICN, 
BY LEW BAKER. 
SUNG WITH IMMENSE SUCCESS, BY LEW BASEL 
Kind friends if you listen, I'll sing you a 
song, 
And the facts now I'll tell to you, 
This world is a 
net-work that's not very strong, 
And catches us as we pass through. 
From the cares of temptation, 
There's no man that's free, 
But as many a 
man gains renown, 
And the way that they do it is easy to see. 
By keeping the workingman down. 
Along with your comrades so gay; 
And before the week has come to an end, 
You'll find that it's all passed away. 
If you'll only put by a 
dollar or two, 
d 
place it in some bank in town, 
You could then wink your eye, tell the boss on the sly 
That they can't keep the workingman down. 
Chorus. 
Cnonus. 
Then hold up your head if you have a 
will, 
Don't care for their sneers or their frowns, 
Stare fate in the face, if your heart's in the right place, 
For they can't keep the workingman down. 
Of course when you are working, your money 
you'll spend, 
You may take this here house, there's no impropriety, 
For to compare it that is my plan; 
The roof is the aristocrat, the walls the society, 
The foundation, the hard working man. 
If you take off the roof the walls still remain, 
Touch the walls the foundation's still sound, 
But touch the foundation, that's the hard working marl 
And the whole thing comes down to the ground. 
Chorus. 
BY LEW BAKER. 
DEDICATED TO IliSS IDA laTJENETT. 
While it's true that fine feathers make fine 
looting birds, 
A 
tree's known by the fruit that it bears, 
And a 
man should be judged by his actions not wprds, 
Nor that of the coat that he wears. 
For you'll find in the ranks of this world's brotherhood_ 
Much that's pure and vicious and bad, 
But never a 
man that is all over good, 
Nor one that is all over bad. 
CHORUS. 
Then speak a 
kind word when a 
good deed you see, 
Fallen man's better nature revealing; 
For no matter however debased he may be. 
He is never quite lost to good feeling. 
While a 
wolf in sheep's clothes shedding crocodile tears, 
Trys to pass himse-f off for a 
saint, 
And the proud Pharisee hurries onward with sneers,. 
As the wayfarer looks sick and faint, 
How often we see some despised-Magdelene, 
Doing what good Samaritans do, 
And relieving the sufferers passed by proud men,. 
Though they spend lifes of shame it is true. 
Then speak a 
kind word when a 
good deed you see.. 
Fallen women's better nature revealing, 
For no matter how sunk in shame she may be, 
She is not quite lost to good feeling.

AIR: DEAR LITTLE ERIAIROCK. 
There's a 
dear little log hut, that memory reveals, 
Where the lovely Savanah am flowing, 
And the sound of the darkies came up from the fields, 
Where the cotton and rice am a 
growing. 
And I 
roam through the cold icey norf's, 
Hills and gorges, 
And I 
sigh for that dear sunny log hut in Ceorgia.

Dat warm sunny log hut,

Dat dear little old time warm log hut in Georgia. 
Oh ! dis old feeble slave he's shed many tears, 
Since he left old massa's plantation; 
Since the cruel war he's wandered for years, 
Up and down thro' the states of de nation, 
But de norf winds blow from de cliffs and de gorges, 
And I 
long for that dear sunny log hut in Georgia.

That surprised me in every form; 
I 
have been at the plow, I 
have been at the spade, 
'Till dark, and at sunrise in the morn. 
But at night I 
would go for some pleasure thro' town, 
I 
was always for pleasure and joy; 
My mother would say when going away, 
Be home early, to-night, my dear boy. 
CHORUS. 
Be home early, to-night, my dear boy, 
Be home early, to-night, my dear boy; 
Don't spend all your money to gamble and drink, 
Be home early, to-night, my dear boy. 
One night I 
left home, and my poor mother was sick, 
In fever of torture and pain; 
She says, my dear boy, take the motto I 
give, 
I 
may not give it to you again. 
But when I 
returned from my night's fun and joy, 
I 
heard my poor mother was dead. 
'Twas then a

SHAKE OF THE HAND. 
-DX WALTER MACE. 
There's a 
feeling that thrills you with joy or with pain, 
That is felt in the shake of the hand; 
And records of ought but a 
thought you may give, 
When you faced to adversity stand. 
How many whose hand, though seemingly kind, 
Like an icicle chills to the bone; 
Not a 
shade of warm feeling within can you find, 
Though appearance will greatly disown. 
CHORUS. 
Then give me the hand of a 
man with a 
heart, 
That scorns to be seen in disguise; 
When you shake it you feel it is honesty's part, 
And the rest can be read in tM eyes. 
There's others from whom not a 
sigh will awake, 
Indifferent and chill they remain, 
As if ail emotion was bound to a 
stake, 
With its limit the length of a 
chain. 
And should you through courtesy be thrown in 
their way, 
Where civility makes a 
demand, 
You just feel the tips of their fingers when they 
I 
As if stung draw quickly their hand. 
Chorus. 
While others you meet more inviting will stand, 
And extend you their palm with a 
smile, 
And greet you quite hearty, at least with the hand, 
Though their eyes are away all the time. 
While some with a 
pleasure that's stamped on 
their face, 
Will greet you with truth in their eyes; 
From the grasp of their hands it is easy to trace,

The curtain is up on the last act brother, 
I'm dying, I 
feel it here; 
We've had many a 
jaunt together, dear boy, 
But my next jaunt will be on a 
bier. 
Do you remember the night we opened in York 
'Tis twelve years now or more; 
It was then I 
first saw her angel face, 
Since then my poor heart has grown sore. 
The overture passed off nightly, 
And our jokes were spicy and new, 
But I 
stuck that night in my end song, 
For her eyes seemed to pierce me through; 
I 
was not in the after piece, so when I'd finished 
I 
washed up and went out in front, (my dance'

could again catch that glance,

I'm almost glad death is so near, 
I 
almost welcome disease;

You can see that I'm no fighter, 
And always take things cool, 
But if the boys make fun of me. 
They'll find that I'm no fool. 
I'm up and up with every one, 
There's no better in the land, 
So if you want an honest friend. 
Then Malon'ey is the man,

Here we are two factory lads, 
From* 
Lancashire we came, 
Our parents in the cotton mill 
Are working now at home. 
But trade was slack, and pay is bad„ 
So they sent us here 
To try and show you all the way 
They dance in Lancashire.

We will make the wooden clogs go tap, tip, top, 
If you'll but give a 
cheer, 
And 'twill give us great delight, 
To show you here to-night, 
How they dance in Lancashire. 
When at night our work is done, 
We dance out on the green, 
The lads and lassies all are there, 
With smiling faces seen. 
Now we've told you all our history, 
If you think us sincere, 
Bestow your kind, applause upon 
These lads from Lancashire.

have always a

didn't come here, boys, in search of a

that I 
meet, 
There's the man you don't meet every day.

When I 
landed in Glasgow, what a 
sight met 
my eyes, 
As I 
first put my foot on the shore; 
There was Felix O'Donough, .blind Barney McGurk, 
And a 
round two or three dozen more. 
Och I 
murther! you ought to have seen them 
all stare, 
And then they did all run away; 
Says I, •‘ my spalpeens, do you think I'm a 
ghost, 
Because I'm a 
man you don't meet every day. 
Chorus. 
I'm in love with a 
nice little girl in town, 
And we're going to be married to-day, 
And if you come over a

A 
right welcome to all I 
will pay. 
And I 
think I

ZENO BY NILES & EVANS. 
AIR: BLUE ALSATIAN MOUNTAINS. 
In a 
row of tenement houses, 
Lived a 
damsel young and fair, 
Her papa wore the trousers 
When her mamma wasn't there. 
Maiden with a 
dimpled eyebrow, 
With a 
voice so young and 'fair, 
Maiden with a 
yaller bull-dog, 
That followed her everywhere. 
Each day, each day, each day. 
Some family would move away, 
For that row of tenement houses 
Never seemed to please or pay. 
To that row of tenement houses 
Came a 
granger in the Spring, 
Just to talk of sheeps and cowses, 
And to hear that maiden sing. 
Just to hear that maiden sing, 
Oh! he spoke about his barnyard, 
Of his chickens and his hog; 
But she thought he was giving her taffy, 
So she called her yaller dog. 
Hurrah, hurrah, hurrah! 
That granger he ran away, 
But left the bosom of his trouses, 
For the dog to chew that day.

When I 
was but sixteen, I 
thought, 
I'd no longer remain single, 
But take for better or for worse, 
A 
man by the name of Jingle. 
He was handsome, only twenty-one, 
With blue eyes and raven hair, 
I 
thought I'd done the thing, in fact, 
I 
was so happy I 
do declare. 
CHORUS. 
It's all very well to married be, 
And think you'll live in clover; 
But it all depends on your husband dear, 
When the honeymoon is over. 
My husband he has put a 
stop 
To all joys that may be; 
While he flies out to visit round, 
I'm left,to nurse the baby. 
He thinks it is a 
woman's duty, 
To slave frdm morn till night, 
While he enjoys the pleasures of life, 
In a 
manner he thinks quite right. 
ChOrtia. 
Now sooner than be what I 
am, 
With every day a 
wrangle, 
By jove, I'd sooner single live, 
By turning round a

So now, I've told you ladies all 
If you would live in clover, 
Pray get a 
husband who'll treat you right 
When the honeymoon is over.

He can skip the tra-la-la-lu, baby mine, baby mine;

Spits tobacco juice in his plate, 
On a

He can eat a 
barrel of cake, baby mine, baby mine. 
At the table he's so queer, baby mine, baby mine, 
Jams the pan-cakes in his ear, baby mine, baby mine. 
He rubs 'lasses on his nose, 
Spills the mustard on his clothes, 
Jabs the hash between his toes,baby mine, baby mine 
And we wash him with a 
hose, baby mine, baby mine. 
He makes faces at the wimmen, baby mine, baby mine. 
In the soup bowl he goes swimming, 
baby mine, baby mint. 
From the ash pan we do yank him 
In his high chair we do plank him, 
And oh! heavens, how we spank him, 
baby mine, baby mine, 
And his face would cave a 
bank in, 
baby mine, baby mine.

Well, ' tis myself that knows it, for it's many's the day, 
Your husband wasn't the only man sat behind the wall, 
There's my old man McGuiness didn't get no job at all. 
The politicians promised him work on the Boulevard, 
To handle a 
pick and shovel and throw dirt on the cart. 
Ali! six months ago they promised him work he'd shortly get 
But believe me, my good woman, they are promising him yet.

Then cheer up, Mrs. Reily and dt n't give way to the blues, 
You and I

They work upon the railroad they shovel snow and slush, 
But there's one thing in their favor, Italians they

BY BABY HART.

ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. 
With the dawn of the morning from far and from near, 
The columns are marehing, and soon they appear, 
You see them approaching o'er hill and o'er dale, 
And each one is armed with a 
bright dinner pail. 
They may not seem warlike, thus simply arrayid, 
But they are the heroes of toil, the tin bucket brigade. 
'Neath the lid of the bucket. tho' humble it seems, 
Are rarest of dainties invitingly clean; 
Filled up to the brim with provident care, 
That the eater might have both enough and to share. 
Don't think it demeaning nor doth it degrade, 
To carry the right of the backet brigade. 
Hide not your position find be not, afraid, 
To carry the right of the bucket brigade. 
To you my fine fellows, with scorn in your eyes, 
With disdain on your lips as you see them pass by, 
Consoling yourselves, you are not like those 
Poor greasy mechanics, in labor soiled clothes. 
Just think of the time when your own father made 
Your wealth, when he marched with the bucket brigade. 
And to all those rich fellows who once carried a 
pail, 
And think that the item's forgotten ard stale; 
Though they are worth thousands and carry no more, 
The old dinner bucket they carried of yore, 
Just think of the time when their own fathers made 
Their wealth when they marched with the 
bucket brigade-

NWT GO TO YOUR RELATIONS. 
WRITTEN AND SUNG BY FRANK BUM. 
We all have our shares of ups and downs 
In every rank and station; 
We are sure to get more kicks and. frowns, 
If we depend on kind, relations. 
it's all very well once or twice to drop in, 
And ask for a 
lit.le in favor, 
But if by chance you go a 
third time, 
They'll construe it to your bad behavior 
CHORUS. 
So ray advice take one and all, 
In.very rank and station, 
And if you want a 
favor done, 
Don't go to your relations. 
I 
speak from experience, and some you'll find 
How often they'll inN ite you, 
But when poverty comes close behind, 
They will soon begin to slight you. 
It's clear away, there's a 
knock at the door, 
Don't open the door too wide John, 
I'm afraid it's that hungry brother of mine, 
kay I'm gone out for a 
ride, John. Chorus. 
I 
thought my sister would prove a 
friend, 
But soon she did deceive me, 
be said these times were not times to lend, 
She would if she could relieve me, 
A 
trifle sister, would keep me afloat. 
I 
shall sink if you don't arrange it. 
She said she'd no less than a 
five dollar note, 
And she hadn't time to change it.

I 
lost my goods but found that day, 
Though against me they had sinned all; 
Death called a 
rich old friend of mine, 
Who left me a 
handsome wind-fall.

But how they altered what they said, 
Their ways were so provoking, 
To hear them say as they hung their heads, Chonsu 
Why Frank we were only joking. 
There is none in this world so blessed as _I, 
With so many kind relations, 
I 
am invited to breakfast, dinner, and tea,

hundred invitations. 
I 
refuse them all though my heart it burns, 
Their friendship I 
don't heed it,

I.am thinking of the day when but a 
little child, 
I 
wandered o'er the meadows to the hill, 
Where the sweet flowers grew, and forever 
growing wild, 
And. the stream e'er flowed by the mill. 
But the old mill house has gone to decay, 
I 
loved it and so did darling Kate, 
And the miller he lies sleeping where the 
gentle breezes blew 
•And we played 'neath the turnpike gate. 
CHORUS. 
For the turnpike gate is the pride of my heart,' 
I 
loved it and so did darling Kate, 
When she sits beside me now, there's a 
smile 
upon her brow. 
That reminds me of the turnpike gate. 
And the old school house has gone to decay, 
Where the schoolmaster heard us recite, 
And those happy, happy days have faded 
from our view. 
When our little hearts were filled with delight 
And when school was out we would wander to 
the spring, 
Where I 
drew for you pictures on your slate; 
And those happy childhood days they'll come 
again no more, 
Fhan we played on the turnpike gate.

ba Scotland's fair lands o'er mountains and rills, 
That's where I 
roamed for many a 
day, 
In looking at the lads and lassies on the green; 
In the fair old land of Scotland far away. 
I 
have waited for her corning, but she hasn't come se y4.1 
'the truth seems to dawn upon me plain— 
They say she is false, but I 
still believe her true, 
She's my darling blue-eyed Scotch Lassie Jean. 
CHORUS, 
OhI Jean, my bonnie Jean, some to your laddie 
once egoist 
They say you were false, but I 
still believe you mina, 
Toll are my bonnie blue-eyed Scotch lassie Jean. 
She said you would meet me, but I've waited long in vain--
In lands far away she does roam ; 
Her promise she will keep— oh I 
break it not my Jean ! 
We'll be happy in our bonnie little home. 
Oh I 
then let me long not wait, lot me meet thee 
soon, my Jew, 
And the Heavens will smile on our love, 
And when life is dead, we will leave this earthly scene, 
ADd our hearts wall dwell in joy and bliss above.

PAT MAY Br-: FOOLISH, 
CORRECT EDITION. 
Let cowardly slanderers say what they will. 
Against the dear land of my birth, 
But I 
will maintain she always will be, 
The grandest old spot on the earth. 
Some say with a 
sneer, we are cowards at heart, 
Fit for nothing but drinking potheen, 
But I 
throw back the villainous lie in their teeth, 
They're as brave as the shamrock is green. 
Citnus. 
Pat he may be foolish and very often wrong, 
Pat's got a 
temper that don't last very long, 
Pat is fond of jollity, as everybody knows, 
There never was a 
coward where the shamrock grows. 
If ever he weeps at the voice of distress, 
Don't blame him, his heart is too warm, 
his family over the ocean, perhaps, 
Must weather black poverty's storm. 
Don't sneer at his sorrows, or laugh at his tears, 
Assist, at least, if you can, 
Remember that Pat on many a 
field, 
Has proved that he is a 
true man. 
Choral:. 
Remomber the Celts and the Saxons are bound, 
By the ties of pure brotherly love; 
Come test him again, and you'll find him as tr Ue 
As the stars in the heavens above. 
And always give honor where honor is due, 
Let hands join'd in friendship be seen, 
For he who despises a 
man for his name, 
Is not fit for a 
country or queen.

SOMEBODY'S .MOTHER. 
RECITED BY GUS Wm/also. 
The woman was old and raged and gray, 
And bent with the chill of a 
winter's day; 
The streets were white with recent snow, 
And the woman's feet were aged and sloe,. 
At the crowded crossing she waited long, 
Jostled aside by the careless throng 
Of human beings who passed her by, 
Unheeding the glance of her anxious eye. 
Down the street with laughter and shout, 
Glad in the freedom of " school let out," 
Come happy boys, like a 
flock of sheep, 
Hailing the snow piled white and deep, 
Past the woman so old and gray, 
Hastened the children on their way. 
None offered a 
helping hand to her, 
So weak and timid afraid to stir, 
Lest the carriage wheels or the horses feet 
Should trample her down in the slippery Streak 
At last came out of the merry troop, 
The gayest boy of all the group; 
He paused beside her, and whispered low, 
"I'll help you across if you wish to go ?" 
Her aged band on his strong young arm 
She placed, and so without hurt or harm, 
He guided the trembling feet along, 
Proud that his own were young and strong; 
'Then back again to his friends he went, 
His young heart happy and well content, 
"She's somebody's mother, boys, you know, 
For all she's aged, and poor and slow; 
And someone, sometime, may lend a 
hand 
To help my mother—you understand I 
If ever she's poor and old and gray, 
And her own dear boy is far away." 
" 
Somebody's mother." bowed low her head, 
In her home that night, and the prayer she mai* 
Was; " God be kind to that noble boy, 
Who is somebody's son and pride and joy.' 
Faint was the voice, and worn and weak, 
But Heaven lists when its chosen speak; 
Angels caught the faltering word, 
And " Somebody's mother's " prayer was heard,

Ther'es a 
dear spot of land far out on the ocean, 
The prettiest island that ever was seen; 
There's no place on earth that tic well suits 
my notion, 
It's the Emerald isle where the shamrock is green, 
Alas! the bold tyrant has taken possession. 
And driven our daughters and sons to exile, 
For no one could stand their tyranic aggression, 
And banished are we from the Emerald Isle.

CHORUS. 
Then its God speed the day that will dawn with 
our freedom. 
When the stars and the harp shall be blended as one, 
Then the poor of ould Ireland will need no help 
to feed them, 
They'll belong to the country of brave Washington. 
When I 
left my dear home my poor heart was 
breaking, 
Oh ! ' Lis a 
sad moment the parting of friends, 
The tear-be-dimed eyes, and the honest 
hand-shaking, 
Oh! that causes the stoutest of hearts to unbend. 
But there are occasions when partings a 
pleasure, 
And one is in crossing the beautiful sea; 
Where toil is rewarded by friendship and treasure, 
In the home of the breve* and the land of the free.

Deep sadness fills my aching heart, 
And tears unbidden flow, 
For on this day my infant died, 
This day one year ago. 
A tender bud so beautiful, 
So fragile, pure and fair, 
Its fragrance fur too fiN+eet to waste 
On earth's f,in-tainted air. 
Through many sad long hours of pails, 
My precious darling lay ; 
Then God in sweJt compassion took, 
My little one away. 
As cold end tigid in my arms, 
His fireless for in was placed, 
Snell agony of soul then felt, 
Can never be effaced. 
CHORUS. 
Baby died one year ago, to-day, 
Baby died one year ago, to-day, 
Baby died, baby died, 
Baby died one year ago, to-day. 
In meek submission how I 
bowed, 
To God's all- wise decree, 
Be only took unto Himself 
The one He gave to me. 
And yet I 
never see a 
babe, 
But, sca'ding tears will start, 
And longly I 
crave to clasp 
My lost one to my heart. 
If I 
my future home could choose, 
In realms where glory reigns, 
'I'd ask to dwell with angel babes, 
Ever singing. heavenly strains ; 
For sadness fills my aching heart, 
And tears unbidden flow, 
For on this day my baby died, 
This day one year ago.

LOVE IT AM A 
VERY FUNNY THING.

Lleder's Extensive Music Piablishing House, No. 60 
Chatham Street, N.,. 
Y. and will be sent post 
paid to any address, on receipt of price, 
35 cents in postage stamps. 
tOh! love it is such a 
very funny thing, 
It catches the young and the old, 
It's just like a 
plate of boarding-house hash, 
For many's the man's been sold. 
It v-ill make you feel like a 
fresh-water eel, 
It will cause your heart for to swell, 
You may love your wife as you do your life, 
But 'twill empty your pocket-book as well. 
So boys, keep away from the girls, I 
say, 
And give them plenty of room, 
You will find when you're wed, they'll bang 
you till you're dead, 
With the bawld-headed end of a 
broom. 
When a 
man's in love with a 
pretty little girl, 
He talks as gentle as a 
dove, 
lie calls her his honey, and he spends lots of money, 
For to show her he's solid in love. 
When his money's all gone, and his clothes up 
the spout„ 
He will find the old saying true, 
That a 
bird in the hand is worth two in the bush, 
What the deuce is a 
fellow going to do. 
With a 
wife and fourteen half-starved kids, 
And tell you it ain't no fun, 
When the butcher comes around to collect his bills, 
With a 
dog and a 
double barrelled gun. 
So boys, keep away from the girls, I 
say. 
And give them plenty of room, 
You'll think you are in clover, till the honey-
moon is orrery 
And then you will wish you were dead. 
With a 
cross-eyed baby on each knee, 
With a 
wife with a 
wart on her nose, 
You will find that love don't run so smooth, 
When you have to wear your second-hand elotheiso 
When the rents are high the kids will cry, 
Rase they ain't got nothing for to claw, 
'You'll holler for'your on to load up the gun, 
For Co vaccinae your mother-in-law.

THE BLUE ALSATIAN MOUNTAINS 
BY CLARA.BELL. 
MUSIC BY STEPMEW ADAMS. 
By the blue Alsatian mountains, 
Dwelt a 
maiden young and fair; 
Like the careless &wing fountains 
Were, the ripples of her hair. 
Were the ripples of her hair; 
Angel mild, her eyes so winning, 
bagel bright her happy smile, 
When beneath the fountain spinnin,g, 
A-de, A-de, Ade, 
Such songs will pass away; 
Tho' the blue Alsatian mountains, 
Seem to watch and wait alway! 
By the blue Alsatian mountains, 
11lany spring-times bloomed and paersecl, 
And the maiden by the fountains, 
Saw she lost her hopes at last, 
She lost her hopes at last. 
And she withered like a 
ilowor, 
That is waiting Tor the rain; 
She will never see the stranger, 
Where the fountains fall again. 
A-de, A-de, A-de, 
The years have passed away, 
But the blue Alsatian mountains . 
Ever watch and wait alway, 
A-de, A-de, A- de. 
The years have passed away, 
But the blue Alsatian mountains. 
Seem to watch and wait alway. 
By the blue Alsatian mountains, 
Came a 
stranger in the spring, 
And he lingered by the fountains, 
Just to hear the maiden sing, 
Just to hear the maiden sing; 
Just to whisper in the moonlight, 
Words the sweetest she had known, 
Just to charm away the hours, 
Till her heart was all his own. 
A-de, A-de, A-de, 
Such dreams mast pass away, 
But the blue Alsatian mountains, 
&ieni to 
and wait alway,
