William Meaux interview, 2012-10-24 : interview conducted by Ellen E. 
McHale 
 
INTERVIEW LOG 
 
 
William Meaux is training fifteen horses. He is running his horses in 
Denton, LA. He has been training since 1991; for 21 years. His father 
was training before him. He took over the business. Horses change-over 
every 3-5 years.  
 
1:31 The racing career of a horse is 3-5 years. They start as 2 year olds. 
They are productive 5-6 years and then they trail off. Most of his horses, 
right now, are young and "unstarted." 
 
2:22 He is working for several different owners, most from Lafayette.  
 
2:55 He talks about the area being horse country. There is a lot of 
history. His dad got started in quarter horses and moved into 
thoroughbreds.  
 
3:35 Talks about the change from quarter horse to thoroughbreds in the 
mid-1970s. It was hard to make a living with quarter horses. 
Thoroughbreds run year-round. Quarter horses only ran in the summer 
and for fewer races.  
 
4:58 He defines a "mixed meet" and talks about them.

5:12 The training is different. Quarter horses run ¼ of mile or less. 
Thoroughbreds run ½ mile to 1½ miles. The Belmont Stakes is a mile-
and-a-half.  
 
5:58 His father taught him about the horses, but not about the Business, 
which has changed a lot since then.  
 
6:36 He talks about how the business has changed. He talks about 
loyalty being important in the past. Owners would stay with a trainer, 
even if they weren't doing well in the races. Now, if you don't produce, 
the owners will find a different trainer, even if you've trained for several 
years.  
 
8:22 He thinks there are limited things you can do to make a horse run. 
There are things that you can do veterinary-wise. Otherwise, there isn't 
much that one trainer does that one doesn't. There is a certain format. 
Maybe you can change things feed-wise.  
 
9:45 There is a progression in training. The first thing to do is to have 
them go around a track and then you work on speed and distance. You 
have to make them comfortable with the starting gate. It is a gradual 
progression. The last thing you want to do is send a baby back there who 
isn't ready because it’s a bad experience and it makes it worse. You 
make it as easy on the horses as possible. He talks about training for the 
gate and making them comfortable.  
 
11:50 He was in college while his father was racing at Louisiana Downs 
and his father asked him to help during his summer break. That was his 
first experience. He was on his first horse when he was 3-4 years old. He 
2 
 
started really working with horses in 1990 as an assistant at Louisiana 
Downs. He got hooked. He fell in love. He went back to school and 
finished before working full-time with horses, which his father stressed. 
The day he graduated from college, he went to graduation rather than go 
to see his horse run. But on Sunday morning, the day after graduation, 
he was mucking out stalls for fifteen horses.  
 
16:02 He has one running tomorrow (Oct. 25, 2012), the 4th race at 
Delta. A "maiden race." 
 
16:34 William has three brothers and a sister. An older brother trained 
for a while. He also worked with their dad. He broke babies and did a lot 
with the mares. Others have no desire to be in the horse business. 
Williams sister is an attorney and his younger brothers didn't go into it. 
His daughter is in to volleyball, but not horses.  
 
18:43 He has two grooms, and one of the grooms son's cleans the stalls 
and there's an exercise boy. He and the fellow trainer in the barn work 
with the same exercise boy. He gets on 10-12 horses a day.  
 
20:14 The horses go to the track 4-5 days a week. They get 2-3 days off, 
depending upon the horse. A horse that is going to race stays on the 
same training schedule. If the race is shorter, you might try to make 
them a little fresher and back off a little with training. You usually 
follow the same training schedule as usual.  
 
21:34 End of interview.
