Dear Allen:
 
I am shocked to discover that I never got- your Peg Leg Sam
 
article and photographs back to you.
 I really am sorry and
 
hope that it hasn't held you up too much.
 
The Festival is all over now and we're back at L
'Enfant Plaza
 
trying to bring some order out of the chaos.
 It all went by
 
too fast;  I never got to see it all and my recollections are
 
still all blurred together.
 It really was a mad undertaking --
as Svatava Jakobson said, only in America...
 
Anyway, one of the advantages for me was meeting so many good
 
people like yourself.
 Please don't hesitate to call on me if
 
I can be o
f any help in your future activities, and give my
 
best to Sam when you see him next. And again, I really am sorry
 
about my sloppy behavior vis-a-vis your article.
 
Sincerely,
 
/

Dear Bess,
 
If your busy s
chedule allows you the time and you still have
 
the Peg Leg S
am article and photos around, I would appreciate you
 
sending them my way.  The documentary f
ilm about Sam i
s to be re-
leased soon and there may be a chance I can find somebody who will
 
use the article.
 
Enclosed i
s the latest copy of Southern Exposure which presents
 
Sam's story in his own words --- I
'd appreciate your comments about
 
it.
 
Hope to see you soon in D

Dear Dr. Gregory:
 
I am sorry to have taken so long in responding to your letter
 
suggesting that we try to bring some New Hebridean peoples to
 
the Festival of American Folklife.
 I did undertake a major
 
campaign here to have some representation of the Pacific Islands
 
at the 1976 Festival, at the very least from Micronesia, but
 
was finally defeated because of the massive costs involved.
 The
 
best we were able to arrange was to bring a few folks from Hawaii.
 
Perhaps another year...
 
I
'm taking the liberty of sending a copy of your letter to my
 
brother, Alan Lomax, who may not be aware of the dance films
 
you mentioned from the New Hebrides.
 As you probably know, he
 
is working on a major research project involving world dance
 
styles and he's continually on the lookout for footage that could
 
increase his sample.
 
I hope your and your wife's work goes well.
 Having just spent a
 
year in Washington, I envy your opportunity to be in the field.
 
And thank you for your kind wishes for the Festival; I really
 
was quite proud of it -- some fine things happened there this
 
summer.
 Perhaps we'll meet at some future AAA gathering and exchange
 
ideas.  I don't think the Festival has received enough attention from
 
the scholarly disciplines; at the very least it seems to me a
 
marvellously cheap opportunity for students to get a bit of. 
V  field

Dear Sir:
 
Having attended the festival a year or two ago,  I remembered
 
fondly the enjoyment it provided when I heard an announcement
 
over the Voice of America today.
 The new one is started and
 
I am sure it will be a success.
 
As an anthropologist working in the "bush" in the island of
 
Tanna, New Hebrides,  I have been impressed by their custom
 
dances here.
 Under provisions of a US Public Health Service
 
research grant,  I and my wife are here for a year plus learning
 
about the culture and the ways of life.
 Perhaps the dances
 
here would be a possible feature for future festivals?
 
Dr. Kal Muller of the Ethnographic Film Center of the Smithsonian
 
took some film of the activities here and those films are on
 
file there.
 Many people here would enjoy visiting the US to
 
perform their traditional dances and have some opportunity to
 
see the US.
 
How could this idea be persued further?
 I would be most
 
willing to help in any way.
 
Thank you for any consideration you may be able to provide.

Dear Jeff:
 
This is just to tell you that the tape arrived safely, and
 
Ralph and I both appreciate your courtesy in sending it along
 
to u
s.  (
Barbara would be joining us in this letter, but she's
 
already back in California.)  I haven't had a chance to hear it
 
yet since Bill McNeill, the Regional archivist, took it home
 
for his own delectation, but I hasten to say he is totally
 
responsible and will bring it back and accession it properly.
 
You may be assured also that none of our tapes will be copied
 
or published without the permission of both the field worker
 
and the performer(s)  involved.
 
It was nic6 to get to see you, even though briefly, this summer.
 
Have you done any kind of evaluation of the program as you saw it?
 
If you should have time to get your reactions down on paper, I
'd
 
like very much to see them.  In the interim, maybe we'll meet
 
either at the AAA or the AFS meetings this fall.
 
Cordially,

Dear Mr. Bishop:
 
I must first apologize for answering your letter of June 1
 
so tardily.
 I can only assume that I misplaced it when the
 
Festival staff moved to the mall during the first week of June;
 
at any rate, I only came across it today.
 
Your program sounds extremely interesting.
 Unfortunately,
 
our plans for the summer were completed during May and we simply
 
have no space for it now.
 Mr.  Rinzler joins me in wishing you
 
the best of fortune and suggests that you might write Mr. B. C
. May,
 
Division of Performing Arts, 2100 L'Enfant Plaza, Smithsonian
 
Institution, Washington, D.C., 20560, during September or
 
October.
 Mr. May will be planning our winter Programs at that
 
time; I
'm afraid that he is too involved just now with the summer
 
festival to give your proposal proper attention.

��; 
You may recall previous letters regarding the "M-ag f
t Lantern.
 
I make this further effort to gain the attention of the Folklife
 
Festival.
 
It is entirely possible that I am tae last remaining "Magic
 
Lantern" projectionist left in the country.  n
rirfn¢ this Bicenten-
nial, it would be appropiate that this early medium be viewed in
 
our nations capital.
 
At the risk of rept
-ating prior letters, I direct y
,ou to the
 
year 1653 when the first lantern slide show was projected at Rome,
 
Italy.  From that place in time the Magic Lantern illuminated the
 
world with its wonderous mechanical transparencies.  With the ad-
vent of the "flickers", the lantern, its beautiful views and the
 
traveling projectionist gradually disappeared into the attic of
 
the national memory.
 None remained to travel the Chatauaua Trail
 
except one.
 
As that person, I desire to be part of the HiCentennial.
 
I would be most pleased to hear from you
. if this letter is of in-
terest to you.

Dear Alison:
 
f
"
 
The film did indeed arrive and I enclose a check; I hope that
 
the fact that it's in American money and on an American bank
 
causes you no problems.
 I
'm not used to international purchasing!
 
Thank you for letting me have it at cost.' I
'm making out the
 
check for $150, however, in view of the vagaries of the exchange
 
rate.
 Please let me know if that doesn't prove to be enough to
 
cover your costs.
 
As soon as I show it to Ralph and Saucy, I shall send it to the
 
firm I think might well want to market it -- Media Center,
 
University.of California, Berkeley, California.
 With any luck,
 
you should be hearing from them in the reasonably near future;
 
if they can't use it, for any reason, I shall look elsewhere and
 
try to keep you informed as to my success.
 
If you consider selling the film directly yourself, you of course
 
should charge a profit, and $200 per print does not seem out of
 
line to me.
 If a distribtion firm, such as Media Center or another,
 
takes it on, they will pay you royalties -- a certain amount per
 
copy sold and a certain amount per copy rented out for showing.
 
That will all be spelled out in the contract they send you.
 I
 
really hope the Media Center people take it; I
've dealt with them
 
successfully for some years now and they are reliable people with
 
an excellent reputation and a large catalogue addressed primarily
 
to the educational market.
 
It was really lovely to meet you;  I too "feel in my bones" that
 
our paths will cross again.
 I would like to get some travelling
 
in one of these days and I
'll surely let you know if I get across
 
the Atlantic.
 
With all best wishes,
 
n

MEMORANDUM
 
TO
 Jim Morris
 
FROM
 Bob,  RaipY, Bess
 
SUBJECT:
 Publication on Decade of FAF
 
February 23,  1976
 
The following outline covers  the contents of the
 
publication proposed by Ralph and Bess in December and
 
reviewed by the three of us since.
 
I.
 Introduction
 
A.
 Definition of problems  the Festival is  designed
 
to address.
 
1.
 cultural erosion
 
2.
 stereotyping of folk cultures,  groups,  styles
 
3
.
 presentation of unrecognized folk cultures  and
 
forms
 
B.
 Statement by the Secretary of his
 
without walls,  living museum, his
 
Festival as  it developed from his
 
concept of museum
 
views on the
 
original suggestions.
 
II.
 Development and Bicentennial Festival Description-
Analysis.
 
In this sequential account of the ten Festivals,  the
 
organization of the data will be problem-clustered.
 
The eight programs will be discussed separately with
 
appropriate theoretical assumptions.
 Each program
 
discussion will include evaluations from a scholarly
 
perspective of our innovative conceptual, methodological
 
and presentational work.
 Finally, a detailed description
 
of the  '76 Festival with discussion of production and
 
staffing.
 
III.
 Impact Upon Participating Tradition-Bearers and Visitors.
 
The impact of the Festival upon participants  (the culture

bearers). and their home communities,  as well as upon
 
Festival visitors.
 Substantial additional research
 
and documentation along the lines of Alan and Anna
 
Lomax's interviews with the Italian participants in
 
'75 would be planned for the  '76 event.
 
IV.
 Application
 
Uses of the knowledge and techniques developed at the
 
Festival with specific suggestions for application to
 
programs:
 
A.
 Living museums
 
B.
 Use of local cultural resources in the schools
 
including suggested curricular materials
 
C.
 In local festivals
 
V.
 Conclusion
 
VI.
 Appendices
 
A.
 Listing of participants and schedules for all
 
Festivals.
 
B.
 Other program book data to be decided upon for
 
inclusion as space permits.
 
There will be a need to put on contract a writer-
reporter  (
between GS 11-12)  to work from April through
 
October on two aspects of the project:
 
1
.
 Recording the organizational details of the  '76
 
event
 
2.
 Scheduling,  structuring,  recording and editing
 
interviews between fieldworker-folklorists and
 
participants to be done away from Festival grounds
 
but during the participants'  stay in Washington.
 
These will be the only primary source data from
 
tradition-bearers in the volume and will comprise the
 
whole of Section III.
 Interviews with visitors
 
will also be handled on a one-day-a-week basis on the
 
grounds by this staff person.
 Bess will assume
 
primary responsibility for the writing although
 
• 
-3-
constant co m
munication with Ralph and Bob will
 
make the book a collaborative effort.

I suggest that we keep this monograph on a non-scholarly level,
 
but if we do choose that route, we can add Archie Green's bibliography
 
of occupational folklife and update it to include the recent social
 
anthropological work in occupational culture.

Prospectus on a Short Monograph
 
on the Presentational Aspects of Occupational Folklife
 
as Viewed From the Perspective of the Working Americans Program
 
This monograph first would place the Working Americans program in
 
the context of other performing Festival Programs; the interesting and unique
 
nature of worker-participants as performers compared with the performers
 
in other areas; producing skill demonstrations as analogues of handicrafts;
 
narratives as the equivalent of songs and dances.  The monograph would
 
also treat Working Americans in the context of other exhibitions whose sub-
ject is American Workers--for example, trade shows, union label shows,
 
historical exhibits.  The aims of the Working Americans production efforts
 
would be discussed, and compared with the aims of these other worker-oriented
 
productions.
 
The next part would treat the actual process of researching, developing,
 
and presenting a Working Americans presentation.  Research would be treated
 
in terms of its theoretical basis--its goals, assumptions, methods--as well
 
V
 
• 
as in t
erms of t
he pracLicaIiLies of  :
.
; r
ieuce--Elie necessiLies eu};cndered
 
by Union funding and cooperation, t
emporal constraints, paucity of quali-
fied fieldworkers, etc.
 
Program development would be treated in theoretical t
erms as a problem
 
in transforming skills and lore performed in situ to performances given
 
at the Festival.  The impossibility of literal translation of one to the
 
other would be the starting point.  Even a bricklayer's craft must be
 
altered for Festival presentation, and the skills of a railroad train crew
 
can only be evoked by representations of their work--static boxcars, moving
 
models, displays, etc.  The parameters of this translation would be expli-
cated:  time (
slowed pace to allow explanations, omitted steps to show
 
results, etc.) space ( you can't drive a truck on the Mall ) routine
 
(
the importance of dramatic skills performance units that visitors can
 
comprehend and digest) and other parameters that will emerge on reflection.
 
Developing presentations of occupational folklore will be a very
 
significant part of this treatment.  Working Americans will have done
 
pioneering work in this area.  We should document the process of helping
 
worker-participants who have performed only to small groups of occupational
 
cohorts to become Festival performers, at ease with and capable of performing
 
before large Festival audiences.  Transforming their intimate performance
 
style into one capable of appreciation by wider audiences.is a task that
 
Herb Shore will help us to undertake
'.  The methods we develop should be
 
recorded.
 
The ultimate goal of this monograph is to document the groundbreaking
 
efforts of the Working Americans program in the field of festival-like
 
presentations, and to help others to mount exhibitions of their own in this
 
v
 
• 
area.
 
The two monographs might also be combined to form a large, complete
 
record of the Working Americans' accomplishments.

MEMORANDUM
 
February 20,  1976
 
TO
 Jim Morris
 
FROM
 Bob Byington qAe
 
SUBJECT:
 Post-Festival Publications from African Diaspora
 
At the most recent meeting of the ADAG there was
 
some sporadic discussion of the subject,  and two possibilities
 
were suggested:
 
1
.
 A volume of notes and data picked up from foreign
 
scholars by AD fieldworkers in Africa and Latin
 
America.
 
2.
 A volume describing and analyzing the effects of
 
the Festival experience upon both the participants
 
and the visitors.
 
I discussed these with Bernice Reagon on February 20,
 
and she told me that their thinking had not progressed
 
beyond the phase of bare suggestion noted above.
 Nor do
 
they presently have any plans for the fleshing out and
 
implementation of the suggestions.
 I concluded that,
 
without considerable prodding,  they are likely to be too
 
busy to follow up on these ideas in the pre-Festival/Festival
 
period.
 As  for the ideas themselves,  the first is  far too
 
fragmentary and amorphous in its present state for me to
 
get any grasp on it at all,  and the second - while a valuable
 
idea and frequently commented upon over the years - could
 
be incorporated in the section of the central Festival volume
 
dealing with impact.

.
 Exhibitions and Performances  
These will be designed to apply the results of ten years research and development of the living museum
 
and cultural custodian concept to the eduction and training of museologists, educators and the general
 
public.
 
A.
 This project will develop a short-term (
2 weeks)  living museum presentation in one of the
 
Smithsonian museums during the summer of 1978 and a three-day Mall presentation in close
 
association with the indoor program.
 A training program for museum personnel wishing to draw
 
on Smithsonian experience in this innovative approach to living presentation will run
 
concomitant with the indoor and outdoor exhibitions and performances.
 
B.
 Traveling Exhibitions: Black Craftsworkers  of Southern Mississippi. 
A collection of traditional
 
crafts objects documented with interviews and photographs of the craftsmen will present the
 
range of creativity among Southern Mississippi Black craf
_tsworkers.
 
Long range objectives:
 
For extensive outreach purposes, Department personnel would make themselves available to non-Washington-
based museums and educational institutions on a consultancy basis.
 In this capacity Smithsonian folklorists
 
will help plan local folklife presentations and fi eld research endeavors using the techniques and
 
insights dveloped during the past 10 years at Smithsonian Festivals and documented in Smithsonian
 
publications.
 The most significant elements of the local presentations will be demonstrated on the Mall
 
in a 1979 three to four day living museum presentation.
 
A second long-range objective is the investigation of presentational models through which local
 
communities can utilize the various media for their own cultural programs.
 
Administrative travel and consultation funds are requested for FY 1978 for planning purposes.

Festival of American Folklife
 
GUIDELINES FOR CRAFT DEMONSTRATORS
 
Purpose of Craft Demonstrations  
The primary purpose of craft demonstrations in the "Old Ways" pro-
gram is to provide Festival visitors with an interesting and informative
 
experience in which they learn about the traditional crafts which have
 
survived among members of American ethnic groups or in the parent
 
countries from which the immigrants came.
 It is the craftsperson and
 
the craft work itself which are important, not the rapid completion of
 
the items which are crafted.
 
Preparing for Craft Demonstrations  
Although the craft process itself is most important, Festival
 
visitors are also very interested in what the completed item looks like.
 
Therefore, if completion of the handcrafted item you make requires more
 
than a few hours, it would add much to your demonstration if you could
 
bring with you some completed and partially completed items to display.
 
Thus, a weaver may want to bring woven items varying in size and in the
 
materials used.
 A wood carver, an instrument maker, or a potter may want
 
to bring some raw materials on which work has not yet begun as well as
 
some partially finished and finished items.
 In this way, Festival
 
visitors may be able to see what the crafted object looks like as it is
 
being completed and they may also be able to see what different kinds
 
of crafted objects can be made.
 
Please do not bring with you any very valuable or irreplaceable
 
objects which someone might be tempted to steal.
 Since the Festival
 
takes place under tents and the air may be very hot and humid or dusty,
 
anything which would suffer from such atmospheric conditions also
 
should not be brought.
 
Be sure to think through what you are planning to do in the demon -
stration and what you will need.
 After you have arrived in Washington
 
it will be too late for Constance Lee, our Supply/Concessions Coordinator,
 
to try to find any materials or equipment you may have forgotten about.
 
Please tell your "Old Ways" contact if any special arrangements are
 
needed for transporting your materials or equipment to Washington.
 We
 
recommend that you bring your supplies with you so you can be sure you
 
will have them on time.
 If they need to be shipped separately or if
 
they need special handling or crating, your "Old Ways" contact should
 
be informed as soon as possible.

Provision of Materials for Craft Demonstrations
 
Careful planning is required to estimate the amount and kinds of
 
materials needed for craft demonstrations for five days.
 You will have
 
to calculate how many hours you will demonstrate each day  (
approximately
 
five hours) and how fast you will be using the materials.
 Because
 
there will be many questions about your work from Festival visitors, it
 
is likely that you won't be working as fast as you ordinarily would.
 
If you have certain specific materials which you use, such as a
 
particular kind of wood for carving or clay for potting, or if you have
 
a favorite source for obtaining your materials, it is preferable for you
 
to bring the materials with you from your home rather than for the "Old
 
Ways" Supply/Concessions Coordinator to attempt to obtain suitable
 
materials here.
 For example, some woods, such as cottonwood, are not
 
easily found in Washingtony
 the consistency and moisture content of
 
potter's clay varies from place to place.
 
If you supply all of your own materials for your craft demonstration,
 
you would, of course, take all your unused materials and completed items
 
home with you afterwards.
 Or you may wish to have the completed items
 
sold on consignment.
 However, please remember that ;
your primary purpose
 
at the Festival is to demonstrate your craft, not to work as rapidly as
 
possible in order to make more for sale.
 
If your materials are supplied by the "Old Ways" Supply/Concessions
 
Coordinator, or if you are reimbursed by "Old Ways" for the materials
 
you obtain, then completed items and unused materials should be left at
 
the Festival.
 
If the "Old Ways" program is providing the materials or reimbursing
 
you for your expenses, please do not purchase or order materials without
 
first discussing it in detail with your "Old Ways" contact.
 You must be
 
able to give an accurate estimate of the costs of the materials and have
 
such expenses authorized by your "Old Ways" contact person before any
 
funds can be committed.
 Be sure to keep receipts for each authorized
 
purchase you make, and to bring them with you when you come to the Festival.
 
You will be reimbursed for any such expenses before you leave Washington.
 
Sales of your Craft Items  
If you want to bring some of your craft items with you to Washington
 
to be sold on consignment in the "Old Ways" Craft Sales Tent, you should
 
discuss your plans with your "Old Ways" contact.
 The kinds of items you
 
would like to sell, the number of items and the prices you plan to charge
 
should be covered in some detail in the discussion, and agreement reached.
 
The price set for sales at the Festival should include 5% for the
 
District of Columbia sales tax and a 10% commission for the Smithsonian
 
Institution.
 
(

k
,
 
0
�
 
You will be responsible for paying any excess haggage charges for
 
items which you bring with you to sell.
 
Upon your arrival in Washington, your "Old Ways" contact and Mrs.
 
Lee will arrange for you to consign the items you wish to sell to Mrs.
 
Elizabeth Dahlin, the Festival Concessions Manager.
 Mrs. Dahlin will
 
give you a consignment agreement to sign and a receipt for the items.
 
Before you leave Washington, unsold items and proceeds from those sold,
 
minus the District of Columbia five percent tax and the Smithsonian ten
 
percent commission, will be returned to you by Mrs. Dahlin.
 
In no case is it permissible for a Festival craftsperson himself to
 
sell items in the Craft Demonstration Tent or anywhere at the Festival.
 
The demonstration of the craft and the sale of the crafted items must  
be kept entirely separate.
 
Craft Books, or Printed Information  
Plans are being made to sell some craft instruction books in the
 
Craft Sales Tent.
 If there are any books or other printed information on
 
your craft(s)  that you would like to recommend, we would appreciate
 
having the titles and your suggestions on where we can obtain them.
 
If you have a supply on hand and want to bring them with you to be
 
sold in the Craft Sales Tent, please discuss this with your "Old Ways"
 
contact person.
 
Tips on Craft Demonstration at the Festival  
1
.
 Try to keep some interesting activity going on all the time.
 
2
.
 Encourage Festival visitors to ask questions but don't wait
 
for them to ask.
 Tell them about what you're doing;
 why you're doing
 
it;  where materials and equipment can be obtained;
 how long it takes
 
to complete the crafted item.
 Are there any interesting or funny stories
 
connected with your craft?  Do you have any special little tricks that
 
make the work easier?
 
3
.
 Be prepared to answer the same questions over and over; the
 
questions may be identical but they'll be asked by different people in
 
your constantly changing audience.
 
4
.
 During your lunch and rest breaks,  when a volunteer is left
 
with your demonstration equipment and supplies, be sure the volunteer has
 
enough information so he can tell Festival visitors at least a little
 
about what you are doing and when you will resume the demonstration.

Old Ways in the New World
 
Festival of American Folklife
 
Guidelines for the Demonstration of Ethnic Food Preparation
 
I  Planning
 
A.
 Choosing appropriate foods to demonstrate
 
The primary purpose of food preparation demonstrations in the
 
Old Ways area is to provide an interesting and informative experience
 
for Festival visitors.
 The preparation process itself should be the
 
focal point; not the distribution of the finished product.
 The dem-
onstration may be repeated several times a day; the quantity prepared
 
each time should serve about 8.
 Huge quantities are costly in
 
ingredients and take longer to put together;  too small quantities
 
don't provide enough "tastes" for the Festival visitors.
 
The following are criteria to be considered in the selection of
 
foods to be demonstrated:
 
1
)
 Preparation should involve several steps and/or have
 
lots of hand movements.
 The process may be complicated
 
and require some special skill e
.g. heavily decorated items
 
like decorative breads or pastries.
 
2
)
 The food may be very typical, or it may be very unusual,
 
but its preparation should be interesting to watch.
 Breads
 
that require relatively little effort to prepare and shape
 
the dough, but long periods to rise are not very interesting;
 
the visitor never sees more than a small part of the whole
 
process unless he/she remains at the food demonstration tent
 
for hours, or keeps returning at specific times.
 For example,
 
if the process of shaping and decorating the bread right
 
before baking is especially interesting, then all the earlier
 
steps should be done simultaneously with the demonstration of
 
some other food preparation which is accomplished in a rela-
tively short time.
 
3
)
 The food can be prepared successfully under Washington
 
weather conditions  (
900 , very humid weather is not unusual).
 
Foods which depend on the incorporation of cool dry air into
 
egg whites or cream (
stiffly beaten egg whites or whipped
 
cream) will be difficult to prepare using Washington's hot,
 
moist air.
 Meringues get gummy and whipped cream gets lumpy.

 y
 
(
rolled cookies) will be more difficult to do unless
 
precautions are taken--use of a chilled rolling pin or
 
very small quantities prepared at one time.
 
4
)
 The food can be given to Festival visitors without
 
being a health hazard because of the hot weather.
 Ex-
amples of foods which may not be given away:
 Anything
 
containing uncooked eggs  (mayonaise,  fluffy puddings
 
using beaten uncooked egg whites) or whipped cream,
 
custards; raw fish; raw meat.
 If any such foods are
 
prepared, they must be discarded; this is disappointing
 
to the Festival visitor, and wasteful.
 
5
)
 The food can provide "tastes" for many Festival
 
visitors by being divided into very small portions, and
 
served easily using disposable  (paper or plastic) products:
 
Plates, bowls, cups, spoons, napkins, etc.
 
6
)
 Preparation of the food should require relatively
 
inexpensive ingredients.
 Any food which uses unusually
 
costly items is not suitable to be prepared in the
 
quantities needed for the Festival.
 
7
)
 The food can be prepared at least two or three times
 
during each day.
 Anything that takes more than four hours
 
from start to finish won't be done before Festival visitors
 
have left for the day.
 If a food ordinarily takes an hour
 
without interruptions to complete  (not including baking
 
time) you can calculate that it will take about 1 1/2 hours'
 
demonstration time because you will want to stop and talk
 
about it or answer questions about it.
 
B.
 Getting ready for the Festival
 
1
)
 For each food you would like to demonstrate:
 Think
 
through the whole process that you're going to demonstrate.
 
If necessary, prepare it in your kitchen, making a list of
 
each utensil, spoon, bowl, baking pan or measuring c
up you
 
use, and all the ingredients.
 Figure out how long it takes
 
to prepare it from start to finish.
 Then calculate the
 
time when no activity on your part is required--when it's
 
rising or baking or draining.
 
2
)
 Discuss with your contact on the Old Ways staff what
 
foods will be prepared and after a mutual decision has been
 
reached, give him/her the total list of equipment you will
 
need and the kinds and amounts of ingredients to prepare
 
each food once.
 Then work out the number of times each
 
day the food will be prepared, so that our Supply Coordinator
 
can provide sufficient ingredients and equipment.
 
t
 
C.
 What to bring to the Festival with you
 
1
)
 Any specialized equipment which is not too bulky to
 
pack and which may be difficult for our Supply Coordinator
 
to find in Washington:
 A special rolling pin, a noodle board,
 
a rosette iron, especially ethnic cooking tools which are not
  
standard equipment in every kitchen, and which may be uneconomi-
cal for us to purchase if you are the only cook who will use
 
them all summer.
 (Discuss this with your OW contact person.)
 
2
)
 Any special ingredients for which you may have a source
 
but which might be difficult for our Supply Coordinator to
 
find here.
 (
Discuss this with your OW contact person.)
 
3
)
 Bring comfortable, washable clothing for hot weather,  low-
heeled shoes  (
sandals or tennis shoes) and aprons.
 
4
)
 If you have a favorite cookbook containing your ethnic
 
specialties, you might like to bring it along to show to
 
Festival visitors.
 
D.
 Food demonstration facilities at the Festival
 
1
)
 You will be working under a 16xl6' tent set on a cement slab.
 
The sides of the tent will be rolled up and your cooking area
 
will have counters on three sides.
 On the fourth side, there
 
will be a refrigerator, a standard kitchen gas stove  (
4 burners
 
and oven), and a double sink with running water.
 The tent also
 
will contain work tables and cupboards, equipment and food supplies.
 
2
)
 There will be a large white formica recipe board on which
 
your recipes can be printed.
 It will be hung so that Festival
 
visitors can copy the recipes or see what the ingredients are
 
for the foods you are preparing.
 
3
)
 A small Festival cookbook  (
10-16 recipes) will be sold in the
 
food demonstration tent each week.
 Each ethnic cookbook has been
 
compiled from recipes contributed by one or several persons or a
 
large ethnic organization.
 If you were one of the contributors,
 
you may want to demonstrate one or more of the recipes in the
 
cookbook.
 Or you may want to give background information on one
 
or more of the recipes or tell how your recipe differs from one
 
in the cookbook.
 
4
)
 There will be a Festival volunteer assigned to help you if
 
you wish: To run errands, wash dishes, help with cleaning veg-
etables, or whatever.
 
II  Tips on food demonstration at the Festival
 
1
)
 Try to keep some interesting activity going on all the time;
 
while you're waiting for one thing to happen  (
baking), begin some—
 
thing else for people to watch.
 
2
)
 Encourage Festival visitors to ask questions, but don't wait
 
for them to ask.
 Tell them:
 What you're doing; why you're doing
 
it; what will be the result; where, how and from whom you learned
 
to cook; what the significance of the food is  (
Is it a special
 
holiday food?  Does it have any historical meaning?  What are the
 
different variations on the menu?  With what is it usually served?
 
Is it a good luck food?  If it needs special equipment, where can
 
it be bought and how much will it cost?  What kind of failures
 
can happen with this food, and for what reasons?  Are there any
 
interesting or funny anecdotes concerning this food?  How can the
 
preparation of this food be improved by some little trick you've
 
learned or developed?).
 
3
)
 Be prepared to answer the same questions over and'over; the
 
questions may be identical but they'll be asked by different
 
people in your constantly changing audience.
 
4)
 Encourage Festival visitors to be part of the demonstration
 
by having them tell of their experiences with food preparation,
 
how their recipes or techniques differ from yours, what the sig-
nificance of the food is in their families, etc.
 
People often gain valuable insights as they talk about some-
thing they were not consciously aware they had thought of before-
hand.
 Suddenly realizing the importance in one's life of one's
 
own foodways traditions can be an exciting experience.
 
This, not simply learning about new foods, should be the
 
ultimate goal of the food demonstrations at the Festival.

survived among members of American ethnic groups or in the parent
 
countries from which the immigrants came.
 It is the craftsperson and
 
the craft work itself which are important, not the rapid completion of
 
the items which are crafted.
 
Preparing for Craft Demonstrations  
Although the craft process itself is most important, Festival
 
visitors are also very interested in what the completed item looks like.
 
Therefore, if completion of the handcrafted item you make requires more
 
than a few hours, it would add much to your demonstration if
.you could
 
bring with you some completed and partially completed items to display.
 
Thus, a weaver may want to bring woven items varying in size and in the
 
materials used.
 A wood carver, an instrument maker, or a potter may want
 
to bring some raw materials on which work has not yet begun as well as
 
some partially finished and finished items.
 In this way, Festival
 
visitors may be able to see what the crafted object looks like as it is
 
being completed and they may also be able to see what different kinds
 
of crafted objects can be made.
 
Please do not bring with you any very valuable or irreplaceable
 
objects which someone might be tempted to steal.
 Since the Festival
 
takes place under tents and the air may be very hot and humid or dusty,
 
anything which would suffer from such atmospheric conditions also
 
should not be brought.
 
Be sure to think through what you are planning to do in the demon-
stration and what you will need.
 After you have arrived in Washington
 
it will be too late for Constance Lee, our Supply/Concessions Coordinator,
 
to try to find any materials or equipment you may have forgotten about.
 
Please tell your "Old Ways" contact if any special arrangements are
 
needed for transporting your materials or equipment to Washington.
 We
 
recommend that you bring your supplies with you so you can be sure you
 
will have them on time.
 If they need to be shipped separately or if
 
they need special handling or crating, your "Old Ways" contact should
 
be informed as soon as possible.

Careful planning is required to estimate the amount and kinds of
 
materials needed for craft demonstrations for five days.
 You will have
 
to calculate how many hours you will demonstrate each day  (
approximately
 
five hours) and how fast you will be using the materials.
 Because
 
there will be many questions about your work from Festival visitors, it
 
is likely that you won't be working as fast as you ordinarily would.
 
If you have certain specific materials which you use, such as a
 
particular kind of wood for carving or clay for potting, or if you have
 
a favorite source for obtaining your materials, it is preferable for you
 
to bring the materials with you from your home rather than for the "Old
 
Ways" Supply/Concessions Coordinator to attempt to obtain suitable
 
materials here.
 For example, some woods, such as cottonwood, are not
 
easily found in Washingtonj
 the consistency and moisture content of
 
potter's clay varies from place to place.
 
If you supply all of your own materials for your craft demonstration,
 
you would, of course, take all your unused materials and completed items
 
home with you afterwards.
 Or you may wish to have the completed items
 
sold on consignment.
 However, please remember that your .
primary purpose
 
at the Festival is to demonstrate your craft, not to work as rapidly as
 
possible in order to make more for sale.
 
If your materials are supplied by the "Old Ways" Supply/Concessions
 
Coordinator, or if you are reimbursed by "Old Ways" for the materials
 
you obtain, then completed items and unused materials should be left at
 
the Festival.
 
If the "Old Ways" program is providing the materials or reimbursing
 
you for your expenses, please do not purchase or order materials without
 
first discussing it in detail with your "Old Ways" contact.
 You must be
 
able to give an accurate estimate of the costs of the materials and have
 
such expenses authorized by your "Old Ways" contact person before any
 
funds can be committed.
 Be sure to keep receipts for each authorized
 
purchase you make, and to bring them with you when you come to the Festival.
 
You will be reimbursed for any such expenses before you leave Washington.
 
Sales of your Craft Items  
If you want to bring some of your craft items with you to Washington
 
to be sold on consignment in the "Old Ways" Craft Sales Tent, you should
 
discuss your plans with your "Old Ways" contact.
 The kinds of items you
 
would like to sell, the number of items and the prices you plan to charge
 
should be covered in some detail in the discussion, and agreement reached.
 
The price set for sales at the Festival should include 5% for the
 
District of Columbia sales tax and a 10% commission for the Smithsonian
 
Institution.
 
Therefore, in order to cover tax and commission costs you should plan
 
to charge 17% more for your item.
 
(

You will be reshorr:c hle for haying any exce:;s baygaye charcie:� [or
 
items which you bring with you to sell
..
 
Upon your arrival in Washington, your "Old Ways" contact and Mrs.
 
Lee will arrange for you to consign the items you wish to sell to Mrs.
 
Elizabeth Dahlin,  the Festival Concessions Manager.
 Mrs.  Dahlin will
 
give you a consignment agreement to sign and a receipt for the items.
 
Before you leave Washington, unsold items and proceeds from those sold
 
will be returned to you by Mrs. Dahlin who will also assist you in
 
calculating the 5% sales tax and the loo Smithsonian commission, and
 
in filling out the necessary forms.
 
In no case is it permissible for a Festival craftsperson himself to
 
sell items in the Craft Demonstration Tent or anywhere at the Festival.
 
The demonstration of the craft and the sale of the crafted items must  
be kept entirely separate.
 
Craft Books, or Printed Information
  
Plans are being made to sell some craft instruction books in the
 
Craft Sales Tent.
 If there are any books or other printed information on
 
your craft(s)  that you would like to recommend, we would appreciate
 
having the titles and your suggestions on where we can obtain them.
 
If you have a supply on hand and want to bring them with you to be
 
sold in the Craft Sales Tent, please discuss this with your "Old Ways"
 
contact person.
 
Tips on Craft Demonstration at the Festival  
1.
 Try to keep some interesting activity going on all the time.
 
2
.
 Encourage Festival visitors to ask questions but don't wait
 
for them to ask.
 Tell them about what you're doing;
 why you're doing
 
it;
 where materials and equipment can be obtained;
 how long it takes
 
to complete the crafted item.
 Are there any interesting or funny stories
 
connected with your craft?  Do you have any special little tricks that
 
make the work easier?
 
3.
 Be prepared to answer the same questions over and over;  the
 
questions may be identical but they'll be asked by different people in
 
your constantly changing audience.
 
4.
 During your lunch and rest breaks,
 when a volunteer is left
 
with your demonstration equipment and supplies, be sure the volunteer has
 
enough information so he can tell Festival visitors at least a little
 
about what you are doing and when you will resume the demonstration.

tion of shared traditions.  We would like you to be part of this
 
year's "Old Ways in the New World" program, by sharing your special
 
skills and way of life with Festival visitors from across the United
 
States and around the world.
 
When plans now being made to provide for your transportation

Festival of American Folklife
 
"OLD WAYS"  PRESENTATION SUGGESTIONS
 
The following are some suggestions based on our first 5 weeks' experience.
 
1
)
 Participants are the most important people at the Festival.
 They should
 
be treated with respect,  supported, not made to work too hard, and they
 
should have a good experience at the Festival.
 Let them know they are liked
 
by Americans and be very tactful in making suggestions or ctiticisms of their
 
performances.
 
2
)
 Prepare your participants to cope with airplane noise,  sound leaks from
 
other stages &areas,  the movement of crowds, Suggest that Wed.  is a day for
 
working out the program & treat it as a kind of dress rehearsal.
 Remind them
 
that a small audience is no embarrassment if the people are enjoying &
 
learning.
 
3
)
 In your presentations aim to educate as well as entertain the audience.
 
Introduce the participants & tell about their lives at home so they can be
 
seen as real & individual.
 Be sure people know who is American, who is
 
foreign, non-professional,  etc.
 Teach the audience to appreciate -
plat they
 
see & hear and teach them to express  :
their appreciation in appropriate ways.
 
If youcan,  ask for questions from
ft_he audience, esp.  in workshops.  Ann-unce
 
other programs i
.e.  in the Activity Center, on the Festival Stage,  in craft
 
areas.
 Repeat everything often as many people move in & out of the area &
 
by the end of a perfoLuiance, you may have a new audience.
 Give the Americar
 
participants equal time & treatment;  the fact that they speak English does
 
not necessarily make them good presenters.
 Encourage the American and
 
foreign groups to interact & if new materials or groups come from this,
 
work them into the program where possible.

 Festival Stage schedules will be worked out with yo 0y Fro:-�k
 
Proshan and participants will usually be picked up by Al McKinney ip�
 
pargo.
 If you need to make changes,  let these people know.
 Stage phone
 
number is 4063-4.
 Festival staff for the stage tries to be flexible, but
 
they appreciate being told about changes in their schedule ahead of time.

) Try to follow the schedule in the Program Book Insert as much as possiblE
 
If there are changes,  let the participants,  the Festival Stage people,
 
your sound technician (Anne Mazonson or Richard Derbyshire),  Susan Kal f
tk,,-
the cultural liason know.
 It is advisable to come to the Mall about 16:30
 
and check the day's program over,  in case illness or whatever necessitates
 
changes.
 Please check the program in the Activity Center over with Kalcik.

 Volunteers, wearing green badges, will be assigned to the stage and
 
participants'  tent and craft and food areas.
 Feel free to call on them for
 
running errands and so on.

)
 If any of your participants have brought records or other materials for
 
sale at the Festival, have them check with the Asst. Program Coordinator
 
for a consignment sheet and to work ou t the details of the sales.
 
*8)
 Please explain the setup of the Activity Center,
 It is very small &
 
the crowd there is small esp. ear l' in the week.
 Some people are un-
comfortable in the setting as it is very informal and they are very close
 
to the audience members.
 Others work well in this setting.
 Rather than
 
make anyone unhappy, programs there can be dropped if they don't seem to
 
be working.
 And others may be suggested if ideas come up during the week.
 
Please also recommend any of your American participants that might give
 
good interviews on immigrant experiences or the keeping of ethnic tradi-
tions.

)
 Small battery operated amplification systems, called Pignoses, are
 
available for anyone ina setting where there are no mikes,  i
.e. the dance
 
floor area.
 Kalcik has these in the Activity Center.

FESTIVAL OF AMERICAN FOLKLIFE: "OLD WAYS IN THE NEW WORLD"
 
ON TOUR: "OLD WAYS IN THE NEW WORLD"
 
In 1976, the tenth annual Festival of American Folklife, co-sponsored
 
by the Smithsonian Institution and the National Park Service, will be held
 
in Washington, D
.C. from June 16 through September 6
.
 This Bicentennial
 
Festival is planned to celebrate the two hundredth birthday of the United
 
States, and will draw together the traditional skills, music, and lore that
 
make up the mosaic of American life.
 
One area of the Festival, "Old Ways in the New World," explores the
 
United States as a nation of immigrants who brought with them from other
 
lands their crafts, music, dance, songs, and foods.
 Those cultural tradi-
tions which have remained alive in ethnic communities in the United States
 
will be presented along with traditions which have survived in the nations
 
from which the immigrants have come to the United States.
 
Following a five-day presentation at the Festival in Washington, D.C.,
 
participants from more than thirty foreign nations will be part of "On Tour:
 
Old Ways in the New World."  They will visit cities throughout the United
 
States on a performance tour to share their traditions, and to become part
 
of American Bicentennial celebrations.
 
I
. General Information
  
A
. Staff Services

dle all finances and business matters, a Stage Manager, and an artistic  di-
rector, usually a folklore scholar who will be familiar with the performers
 
and their material.
 
B

.
 Publicity
 
Prior to the group'
ls arrival, the sponsoring organization will be
 
sent information about the group as well as slides, photographs, and musi-
cal tapes.
 This material will be used in newspapers and in radio and tele-
vision.  When the tour group arrives in a city, the first day may involve
 
interviews and short performances for a television taping.  Most television
 
and radio stations in the United S
tates are privately owned and operated,
 
rather than government owned.  They allow a certain portion of their view-
ing t
ime to show tapes of events that will be of interest t
o the public-
at-large.
 These tapes may be aired by a television station in order to
 
attract audiences t
o the public concert and to share the folk traditions
 
with the greatest number of people.
 
F
.
 Commercial Bookings
 
The Smithsonian Institution is not in a position to arrange com-
mercial bookings for touring groups.  Admission fees may be charged for
 
some performances on tour to help defray some of the expenses incurred by
 
the sponsoring organization in hosting the t
ouring group, but no perform-
ances will be profit-making.

Festival Schedule
 
Participants should arrive in Washington two days before
 
they are scheduled to appear at the Festival,  to allow time for
 
orientation,  rehearsals,  sightseeing, and relaxation.
 In the day
 
preceding the Festival,  groups may also be requested to work with
 
the presenters and foreign participants on repertoire and
 
programming.
 
Performances and demonstrations at the Festival will run
 
from 11 a
. m.  to 5 p. m., but individual participants will perform
 
formal ly for only a few hours a day.
 Each program will have its
 
own stage;  participants will perform mostly on one of these
 
program stages.
 Once or twice during their stay, participants
 
may be asked to take part in Festival-wide daytime programs on
 
a larger stage.
 Participants mays also expect to be part of one
 
evening performance on the main Festival stage.
 
Participants will receive a map of the site and a schedule
 
of events when they arrive.
 Social events and shopping excursions
 
will be planned for evenings during the Festival.
 
• 
Housing and Food
 
All Festival participants will be housed at a L
�niv r
_sity
 
which is 20 minutes from downtown Washington and the Mall
 
(
the Festival site).
 Participants representing different
 
regions, races, and nations are housed in modern buildings
 
with double rooms and shared baths.
 In most cases, members
 
of a single group will be assigned rooms in the same area
 
of the building.
 Often, ,many groups will be living on the
 
same floor.
 There are .
facilites at the college for rehearsing,
 
eating, relaxing, watching TV,  and doing laundry.
 There is
 
a small store on the campus which carries sundries,  stamps
 
and postcards, and there are other stores nearby.
 Participants
 
are urged to bring with them all items they will need during
 
their stay, especially any medicine.
 
Pets may not be brought to the college.
 
Regular shuttle service will be provided between the
 
college and the Mall.
 Participants who drive to Washington
 
must leave their vehicles at the college as there is no parking
 
available on the Mall.
 
Morning and evening meals will be served in the
 
cafeteria which offers a varied menu.
 The mid-day meal will
 
be served at the Festival site.
 Dinner will be provided on
 
the Mall for those participants scheduled for an evening
 
program.
 Special arrangements can be made for people who can-
not eat certain foods because of health or religion, but Festi-
val staff must be informed of this in advance.
 
There also will be a variety of foods sold at the Festival.
 
Health Facilities and Insurance
  
There will be Red Cross first aid facilities at the
 
Festival for any health emergencies, and there will be ambulance
 
service.
 Sickness and accident insurance coverage during the
 
Festival will be provided by the Smithsonian for those partici-
pants who do not have their own health insurance or Medicare.
 
Liability for Personal Possessions
  
The Smithsonian Institution can not assume responsibility
 
or provide insurance for personal possessions of participants.
 
Participants should take special care in packing musical
 
instruments and other valuable items to protect them from
 
damage while traveling.
 Participants may also wish to insure
 
personal property against loss or damage.  It is suggested that
 
I
 
• 
very valuable items,  such as antique musical instruments,
 
objects made of precious materials, or with special personal
 
value not be brought.
 
Airlines are usually willing to pay for articles damaged
 
in baggage handling, but valuable instruments and costumes which
 
are lost or damaged may not be able to be replaced easily or
 
at all.
 
Security
  
Park Service police patrol the Festival day and night,  and
 
lock-up areas will be provided for participants'  valuables.
 
However, participants are warned to keep close watch on their
 
belongings at all times.
 Volunteers will guard your belongings
 
on your lunch break.
 Be sure to arrange this with your Area
 
Coordinator.
 
Trave 1
 
Roundtrip travel to the Festival will be provided and travel
 
arrangements and reservations will be made by Festival staff,
 
after consulting with participants.
 Information and tickets then
 
will be sent to participants.
 
Honorarium
 
An honorarium of $25 per day will be paid for each of the
 
five days that the participants performs at the Festival. Checks
 
for the total amount due will be issued to all participants
 
before their departure from Washington.
 
Climate 
Participants should expect hot weather, with an average
 
range of 80°-90°F during the day to 60°-65°F at night.
 The
 
weather tends to be humid in Washington, with fairly frequent
 
rain.  At the Festival site, performance areas will be under tents
 
and protected from rain and sun.
 
Clothing 
Participants should bring the kind of clothing which is most
 
comfortable in hot weather, plus some type of rainwear,  a light
 
jacket,  or a warm sweater.
 There may be an event scheduled in
 
the evening,  such as a party or a concert,  for which men may wish
 
to bring a coat and tie and women,  a long or street-length dress.
 
_ Sunglasses,  a hat for shade,  and comfortable walking shoes are
 
also recommended.
 Transportation on the site will be available
 
for those who cannot walk and for heavy equipment, but most par-
ticipants will have to walk at least short distances to and from
 
I
 
their areas.
 If you have any problem walking, or have any
 
concern about getting around on foot, please do not hesitate
 
to discuss this with any member of our staff.
 
There will be Festival staff members assigned to attend
 
to participants'  needs and to provide orientation sessions for
 
all Festival participants.
 They will be a,,
r
ailable to answer
 
questions and make you feel at home.
 Every effort will be made
 
to insure your comfort and enjoyment during your stay in Was h-
ington.

ROUGH DRAFT
 
"Old Ways in the New world" is the part of the Festival of American
 
Folklife that concerns itself with the lofe of immigrant and ethnic-
�wi
 V-
Americans and with
 traditions as they have taken shape in
 
the cognate oxikxxax foreign couttir
ies.
 Besrd0es presenting song, dance,
 
ways
 
and music on performance stagesi  food
 -and craft demonstra-
tions in specially designed are al "Old Ways" will have an Activity
 
CEnter which will be shared by the .
two ethnic
 groups and countries
 
purpose
 
that are scheduled for the Mall each week this summer.
 One
s of the
 
activity Center is to provide a place where low profiele  or small
 
performance genres of folk tradition may be presented, tsuch as story
 
telling.
 Another purpose is to offer a place where staff, participant-d
 
(
both foreign and domestic), and Festival visitors may interact and share
 
their culturel experience.
 It is also hoped that the Center may provide
 
U
 
a way,�f tap
e
s the folk heritage of the x Festival visitors;  to treat
 
them as part of the living museum which the Festival is;  to demonstrate
 
to them that they too are ca rriers of important traditions.  The method
 
we will use to achieve the latter goal is a collecting project.
 The
 
Festivtl offers a unique opportunity for collecting because the presentations
 
of folk traditions in  "Old aWays"
 stirs the memories and sense
 
of ide"tity of the visitors.
 IN addition,  the ambience of the Bicentennial
 
celebration has stimulated many to consider their past and the part they
 
and their ancestors have played in the g
 .
6� development of this
 
Nation.
 And since the visitors come from all over the countryd and the
 
te 
Festival may be l
 e
eks
, we have an opportunity to collect f
►64m a
 
wide range of people in terms of ethnic background, degree of comittment
 
to ethnicity,  geographic location,  age,  and so on.
 
The two themes of the Activity Center  , The Immigrant Experience and the
 
Ethnic Experience  (
especially as reflected in celebrations and traditional
 
expeessive culture),  have been chosen because they applyxko in some way
 
to most members of the ethnic communities that will be featured over the
 
summer in'bld Ways'
 Various graphics,  such as maps, photos,  short  printed
 
statements,  as well as some audio visual material  (a slide presentation
 
on immigration and another on ethnic traditions)  will reflect these themes
 
and , hopefully,  s timulate the visitors to khimk consider their own
 
past and folk heritage.
 
One of the main activities of the Center will be collecting,material
 
from the Visitors that centers on these two themes.
 I
le will try to get
 
them to share with us,  on tape,  the narratives,  oral histories, memorates
 
and so on that they or their parents or grandpapents  told about the trip
 
to America and the- life here.
 The Ethnic experience will focus on the
 
second and following generations of the immigrants and their traditions,
 
eelebrations,  artifacts, organizations.
 In addition, we will have the
 
opportunity to collect i
r©rm the Festival participants, especially the
 
ethnic-American performers who can speak about the preservation and handing
 
on of their own folk material as well as their thoughts on the experience
 
of performing at the Festival.
 The latter might be done individually or
 
collectively as a group discussion.
 (ONe such session was taped last
 
year when the Italians and Italian-Americans talked about their lives
 
and the meaning and significance of their traditions.)
 
•
 •
 • 
The collecting project will be headed by the "old !
-
Nays" folklorists.
 
The plan is to recruit as interviewers students in courses
 
that have some relationship to the kinds of material that can
 
be collected.
 These might include history,  American studies,
 
folklore and anthropology courses offerred during the summer
 
sessions of 1976.
 The collecting could be one of the course
 
requirements pro$iding a field experience, perhaps along with
 
a paper or project based on the material collected.
 
The  "Old Ways" folklorist can provide bibliographic mat-
erial, background,  and interview training geared to the Festival
 
situation aaxwotixxxx including the theoretical base of the
 
Festival and the kinds of questions we want asked.
 "Old ways"
 
would provide tapes and tape recorders.
 The tapes would belong
 
to the Smtihhsonian but may be used for educational purposes (if
 
the Institution is acknowledge d
 by the individual collectors
 
who may make copies of their own if they wish.

The collecting project is part one of a two part plan.
 The
 
f
 
secod step would be to use the collected material as the bas&s
 
for publication.
 A survey of the scholarly works extant on
 
y
„
 cr "
 C,
-J N
 .1 . - 
immigrant and non-Flack, Native American, or Hispanic ethnic
 
relatively
 
folklore reveals thatIlittle collecting  or theoretical work
 
has been done in this area of folklore especially when viewed
 
in terms of the importance of white ethnic groups in our plural
 
culture.
 The collection we plan to amass should be sizeable
 
and representative enough to form a soldd foundation for theor e-
tical and analytical conclusions to be drawn from it about these
 
types of folklore and about the emic view of the immigrant and
 
ethnic experience.
 
lxxHx The plan is for two volumes, each with a theoretical
 
and analytical sm introduction based on the collected materials
 
and on the scholarly work abailable (with which the "Old f
lays"
 
folklorist is familiar)  xxd to be followed by a representative
 
sample of the texts collected.
 THe volume on the Immmigrant
 
Experience will probably contain chiefly narratives, oral
 
histories and memorates.
 The volume on Ethnic Experience will
 
probably consitq mainly of family sagas,  ethnic traditions and
 
customs,  and definitions of ethnicity.
 The works will be useful
 
in iotkioxaxxxxxxaxxox the study of American folklore but equally
 
useful for studies in .
American history, American culture,xixkf
fxxkx
 
American literature,  sociology,  anthropology.

Our collecting will be done by folklore and anthropology students
 
and will focus on two central themes of America's pluralistic
 
culture and history- the Immigrant Experience and the Ethnic
 
Experience.
 The collections will be used to produce two volumes
 
on these subjects.
 Each will have an analytical and theoretical
 
introduction  (based on analysis of the data and on scholarly
 
research already completed)  and a section devoted to a repre-
sentative sample of the stories and traditions collected.

 INTRODUCTION
  
The Festival of American Folklife, to be presented by the
 
Smithsonian Institution during the summer of 1
976, is one of the
 
many celebratory activities planned across the breadth of the
 
nation.
 Because the Smithsonian is the national museum and thus
 
a scientific inLAitution, the Festival will concentrate upon the
 
process of self-examination that inevitably accompanies  any an-
niversary. I
tsfocus will be limited and specific; it will examine
 
the traditional arts -- the songs, dances, stories, foodways,
 
crafts -- all the hand and heart skills which are the treasured
 
possessions of the anonymous citizens of this nation.  These are
 
the springs from which our popular and cultivated arts flow; they
 
convey the central statements of our democracy.
 
The United States is particularly rich in such traditional
 
home-crafted arts because, since the people now called the American
 
Indians crossed the Bering Straits into an empty continent thousands
 
of years ago, we have always been a country of immigrants and, thus,
 
the proud inheritors of the artistic  styles of many different peoples.
 
The section of the Festival of American Folklife that deals with this
 
particular feature of United States culture is called 'Old Ways in the
 
New World."
 
In "Old Ways," we bring together the sons and daughters of people
 
who immigrated to the United States from various parts of the world
 
and their cultural cousins who stayed at home. These two groups join
 
L
  
-
z-
together in the practice of their traditional artistic and creative
 
behavior; thus they can celebrate a kind of family reunion while
 
they examine together the changes that their different experiences
 
have brought about.
 
The philosophical base of the Festival is S
ecretary Ripley'
-s
 
interpretation of James Smithson"s mandate to establish an institution
 
"for the increase and diffusion of knowledge," clearly indicating the
 
research and educational roles of the Smithsonian.  Secretary Ripley,
 
commenting on the Institution's function as a museum and conservation
 
organization, extends this commitment and provides a basis for a ra-
tionale for an applied folklore program.
 
We are a conservation organization, and it seems to us
 
that conservation extends to human cultural practices.
 
The possibility of using a museum that is essentially
 
a historical documentary museum as a theater of live
 
performance where people actually show that the objects
 
in cases were made by human hands, and are still being
 
made, practiced on, worked with, is a very valuable
 
asset for our role as a preserver and conservator of
 
living cultural forms, and it should be understood in
 
those terms.  It is not a kind of razzle-dazzle, a
 
vaudeville show that we put on.
 It i
s, rather, a de-
monstration of the vitality of those cultural roots
 
which surround us and are so often overlooked.  The
 
fact that we celebrate ethnic diversity in our culture
 
is, I think, extremely important.  We have too often
 
thought of the Bertrand Lindsay-like concept of the
 
_United States being "The Great Melting Pot," the great
 
homogenizing element in Western Civilization.  But, as
 
we`ve discovered, this is by no means true.
 It is
 
worthwhile being proud, not fiercely proud, but gently
 
and happily proud of the continuance of these cultural
 
roots and their observances and practices which we
 
celebrate.

II.  THEORETICAL GUIDELINES FOR FIELDWORK
  
Fieldwork for "Old Ways" may be different from what you are used
 
to, since your time is limited and your goals fairly circumscribed.
 
Rather than doing a survey of a country or ethnic group's lore, you
 
will be looking mainly for dance, music, song, f
oodways, crafts, oral
 
traditions, and exhibit elements that fit into the program ideas that
 
follow.
 Thus your fieldwork is presentation, not publication, oriented, 
and you will need to keep in mind as you plan and carry out fieldwork
 
the needs of the various areas of "Old Ways" to be described.
 I
t is
 
also important to collect enough data and potential performers to al-
low you flexibility in the presentation planning to be done in the
 
spring.  The juggling of budgets, schedules, political problems, and so
 
on, necessitate conceiving of the Festival as something of an emergent
 
structure.  These guidelines give you the plans as they are now, and
 
you will be apprised of any changes that affect you.  Another kind of
 
flexibility built into the Festival situation is the fact that each
 
country and ethnic group's circumstances and needs are different.  The
 
guidelines below may be adjusted to meet these, and you should feel
 
free to discuss with the fieldworker coordinator the application of the
 
guidelines to your data.
 
-4-
A.
 Cognate Concept  
The base concept of the "Old Ways" presentation in the past has
 
been the cognate approach, an attempt to illustrate both the foreign
 
roots and the American cognates and their shared heritage and diver-
gence.
 Where possible this could mean bringing together people from
 
the same region or even the same village - both those who emigrated
 
and those who stayed at home.
 Where this is impossible or impractical
 
we turn our attention to cognate behavior or style cognates, looking
 
for parallels in all aspects of traditi)nal behavior from cooking to
 
dance.
 We think this is a healthy kind of self-examination for our
 
domestic peoples - who draw strength from discovering their relation-
ship with older cultures - as well as for our foreign guests, who can
 
return to their homeland proud of the virility of their own art forms
 
which remain clearly identifiable though removed by oceans of time and
 
space.
 
Cognates may then be treated as parallel or in terms of contrast
 
or complementarity.
 This system requires the fieldworker(s) for a
 
nation and its matching American ethnic group to develop a dual program
 
conception.
 He/she must think in terms of total presentation, inte-
grating the foreign and domestic elements, as well as of the foreign
 
contingent alone, since the latter must tour as a unit after the Festi-
val.
 
You will want to keep in mind, however, that the Festival is a
 
celebration of American folklife.
 We are not trying to represent the
 
pnw

foreign country's folk heritage.  The focus should be on American
 
f
olklife, and the foreign component should parallel, contrast, comple-
ment or supplement the domestic presentation and enrich the American
 
ethnics' sense of their heritage.
 Conceptually then, the fieldwork
 
should be done in the United States first.
 Since that is not possible
 
in most cases, planning for the foreign should take the domestic into
 
account.
 
B
.
 Traditional Performers
  
We find that the parallels bewteen cognate cultures stand out
 
more clearly when we present our most genuinely traditional performers,
 
those whose music and dance or handicraft springs directly from a par-
ticular community, unaffected by complexities of other than face-to-
face communication.
 Such traditional artists are found mostly among
 
working people - farmers, miners, housewives, people who work with
 
their hands.  We are not interested in the professional interpreters
 
of traditional art or those who revive it, since they can find other
 
outlets for their contribution.
 In our outdoor festival among the
 
trees near the Lincoln Memorial, we bring together the ordinary,
 
though at the same time very special, citizens of the world.
. non-
professional performers who join together in a people-to-people cele
 
bration.  We also feel this is a very appropriate commemoration of
 
the birthday of our nation, originally peopled not by the educated or
 
the aristocracy, but by ordinary men and women from many parts of the
 
world, wise in the ways of their forebears.  This accumulated wisdom
 
6
 
-6-
hashelped shape our destiny, and the Festival of American Folklife
 
is in part a way of acknowledging our debt to the many peoples of
 
the world who came together to build this new nation.
 
C
.
 Community and Celebration
  
It has been useful in the past for some fieldworkers to research
 
and present tradit
:bns that spring from a sense of community or that
 
revolve around a celebratory event, such as Midsummer, because many
 
genres survive in the context of such community celebrations.  Appro-
priate would be parades, processions, picnics, festivals, religious
 
ceremonies, wedding festivities or any similar event in which perform-
ing arts are closely associated with other traditional expressive forms.
 
If at all possible, other program components should support the speci-
fic celebration theme and the event should allow for direct participa-
tion by Festival visitors.
 
D
.
 Age Range
  
For a balanced picture of community life, participants' ages
 
should reflect the age range of the whole community.
 Demonstrations
 
and workshops given jointly by members of different generations can
 
make a valuable statement about the way a tradition is transmitted and
 
retained in the community.
 
0
 
-7-
E
.
 Clothing/Costume
  
Clothing or costume worn by Festival participants must be the
 
same as that customarily worn for esoteric performances and celebra-
tions in the home community.  Ordinary clothes are appropriate for
 
Festival events which represent everyday activities at home: cooking
 
and craft demonstrations, teaching and discussion workshops, most
 
music and dance.  National costume or other traditional dress may be
 
worn for Festival events representing feast days, holidays, or other
 
celebrations, only if i
t is customarily worn on those occasions in the
 
community.
 Costumes used only for stage performances, or for other
 
exoteric purposes are not appropriate for the Festival.
 
F
.
,
 Visitors' Participation
  
A keynote of the Festival of American Folklife is visitors' part-
icipation.
 Opportunities for visitors to directly experience tradition-
al culture (
by tasting foods, singing, dancing, playing games, drinking
 
coffee in a traditional cafe setting, or joining in a procession, for
 
example) should be maximized in each of the program components.
 
G
.
 Context
  
The Festival is necessarily performance-oriented, but we try to
 
put the performances into cultural context as clearly as possible.
 
0
 
W
O
 
-8-
This can be done in the presentation and introduction of performances;
 
in workshops and discussions held in the Activity Center (
see P
.13  )
 
and on the stages; in photos, video tapes and other material in the
 
Activity Center or demonstration areas.
 
The context of the performance might be:
 
1
)
 the relationship of traditions to community life and
 
community members;
 
2
)
 the relation of traditions presented at the Festival to
 
each other;
 
3
)
 the relation of traditnns from foreign and domestic
 
communities t
o each other.

II. AREAS OF "OLD WAYS: PRESENTATION AND FIELDWORKER'S RESPONSIBLITY
  
TO THEM
 
The following comments are directed to persons doing domestic
 
and foreign fieldwork; if you are doing only one or the other, ignore
 
what does not apply.
 
The procedure usually followed for selection of foreign partici-
pants is that the fieldworker, sometimes aided by a folklorist or other
 
scholar from the foreign country, makes documented suggestions about
 
potential participants.  Final decisions, based on these recommenda-
tions, are made by DPA s
taff,  Fieldworkers should be very careful not
 
to make, or seem to make, commitments to potential participants.  Let-
ters that make this very clear are provided for you to leave with per-
sons you interview.
 
Since having foreign participants  in the "Old Y
$ys"program is
 
dependent upon the willingness of the various nations to provide round-
t
rip transportation for their participants from their homes to Washing-
ton, lengthy diplomatic negotiations usually have preceded overseas
 
fieldwork.  Thus, the "Old Ways" program is based on a government-to-
government relationship, and it is important that the fieldworker be
 
concerned with the political inplications of his/her activities.  We
 
urge you to check regularly with the American Embassy in the country
 
you are working with and abide by their information and advice.
 
The main program focus is on performance-oriented traditions (
to
 
include narratives, whenever possible) supplemented by cookery, crafts,
 
0
 
0
0
 
-10-
exhibits, games, etc., selected to fit in with the various areas
 
indicated below.
 Small-performance material may be presented in
 
what we call workshops, which may be discussions by participants
 
(
and visitors); demonstrations of styles, skills, games, etc.;
 
teaching to visitors of songs, dances and so on which may take place
 
on the main stages or in the Activity Center.
 
The groups will number appr
oximately twenty-three foreign parti-
cipants (
one folklorist-presenter, one other person perhaps from the
 
government or a translator to make a total of twenty--five) and twenty-
three domestic participants maximum.
 
A
.
 Performance S
tages
  
Main performances and some workshops will take place on stages,
 
which will be covered, or partially enclosed by tents for protection
 
from sun and rain.
 
The fieldworker's responsibility to this area has been outlined
 
above.
 
B
.
 Food-Demonstration and Sales
  
Foods demonstrated may include both festive and basic items of
 
traditional cuisine, and should involve special cooking utensils and
 
techniques and a process that is interesting to watch.  Demonstrators
 
0
 
0
 
are encouraged to share with Festival visitors their personal
 
knowledge of.foods and cooking and hence, should be persons who have
 
an aptitude for talking to or relating with crowds.  More information
 
on the function and role of culinary traditions in community life is
 
provided by photographs and printed recipes displayed in or near the
 
food demonstration booth and by inexpensive recipe books prepared es-
pecially for the Festival by participants, fieldworkers, and staff.
.
 
Food concessions are usually run by ethnic groups in or near
 
Washington whose members volunteer their time and home kitchens for
 
the preparation of traditional foods in large quantities.  The sale
 
of foods makes it possible for Festival visitors to experience per-
sonally a traditional culture and to participate directly in tradition-
al ethnic celebrations on the Mall.
 
The fieldworker should provide where possible:  clear and complete
 
recipes with some personal information about the donor; the name of a
 
good cook-demonstrator (
possibly one of the participants or a relative);
 
the name of a group that might be interested in the food concession;
 
ideas for food items and utensils to demonstrate and sell; ideas and
 
materials for presenting the context of cooking; the name of a contact
 
in the community who might provide some of this information.  We will
 
especially want this material from the ethnic American communities.

.
 Craft Demonstration and Sales
  
Traditional crafts may be demonstrated in a special crafts area
 
or in the Activity Center by a person who is skilled in the craft
 
and also good at sharing verbally with the visitors.  The problems
 
of securing and transporting equipment and supplies internationally
 
are too complex to warrant the inclusion of crafts from abroad in
 
any but exceptional cases; thus most of the crafts persons will be
 
from ethnic American communities,
,
 
Crafts that are made or demonstrated at the Festival or are
 
closely tied to some presentation (
for example, used in the celebration
 
of a wedding or festival) may be sold.
 
The fieldworker may:  supply suggestions for crafts that could be
 
demonstrated and sold; suggest persons, or contacts, who could help us
 
locate persons to demonstrate the crafts; provide background material
 
such as history and photographs that would help us present the context
 
of the craft.
 
D
.
 General Sales
  
There may be a general sales area which offers books, records.
 
food ingredients, food utensils, craft items, costume elements and so
 
on for sale.
 See the concession letter for further discussion of what
 
would be appropriate and how you may help.

E
.
 Activities Center
 
The purpose of the Activity Center is to provide some of the
 
context material for the performance aspect of the Festival, and
 
opportunities for the interaction of staff, visitors and partici-
pants in an intimate, informal setting and for activities and lore
 
that a stage setting might not promote.  The area will be tent-
covered and contain tables and chairs, possibly a low stage, and some
 
equipment for collecting (
i.e., tape recorders and videotape) and
 
for instructing (
i.e., film, slides, videotape, and some display areas
 
for maps, photographs, etc.).  The Center will focus on two themes:
 
the Immigrant Experience and Ethnic Celebration.  Within this frame-
work we will conduct some collecting of oral narratives (
i.e., immi-
grant lore) and present some small performance material such as songs
 
and storytelling, workshops, demonstrations, and discussion groups
 
which explore the unique experiences and contributions of each week's
 
featured ethnic groups.
 
The fieldworker may:  make suggestions for types of activities
 
and material appropriate for the Center; suggest and secure display
 
materials such as photographs of immigration and ethnic and family
 
celebrations, newsletters, posters and flyers from ethnic groups,
 
recipes (
especially handwritten or containing information about the
 
use and the person donating the recipe). The "Old Ways" office would
 
need the materials in sufficient time to have copies made, unless the
 
materials may be kept permanently in our archives. The staff may also
 
0 0

J
 
-14-
prepare video tapes of immigrant narrators and maps indicating the
 
waves of immigration and the origin of groups participating at the
 
Festival; thus background material that would be helpful in the pre-
paration of these and similar material would be helpful.
 
In addition, the fieldworker will be responsible for supplying
 
ample and adequate photographs to be used by Ethnic Tours, in the
 
Program Book, and for publicity.  The photographs you provide 'Old
 
Ways" as part of the documentation of your fieldwork, to give us an
 
idea of the context of the performance and how it looks, are different
 
from those used by publicity and by Tours.  Particularly useful for
 
them are clear, black and white photographs featuring one main figure
 
in action.
 Check the material provided for you on Ethnic Tours/ Pub-
licity Needs for further details.
 
IV.  RESPONSIBILITY TO PARTICIPANTS
 
The participants are the most important element of this people-
centered Festival.  We want to encourage their traditions, support
 
their community efforts, and establish a climate at the Festival which
 
will allow them to perform at their very best. We think it is important
 
to show them the respect due them, to avoid cultural and emotional
 
rip-offs, and to provide lots of TLC and patience for persons who are
 
likely to suffer major or minor types of culture shock.
 
You can help us do this: first, by making available as much in-
formation as possible about Festival and living and touring arrange-
ments in the U
.S. to potential participants. Check the Participation
 
0 0
 
-15-
Information sheet and pass on to us any easy questions for which
 
you don't have answers.
 
Second, you will need to provide us with information that will
 
help us prepare for the participants.  Please anticipate any special
 
needs your group members might have.  Any participants who might not
 
be able to travel, withstand Washington summer heat, or walk moder-
ate distances should not be invited to the Festival.  Give us inform-
ation on any social and religious habits  that should be considered
 
in the Festival planning: special housing needs, strong food prefer-
ences and avoidances, customary religious observances, male-female
 
relationships, need for privacy.
 
V
.
 AREAS OUTSIDE "OLD WAYS"
 
A
. Children's Area
 
The Festival includes an area devoted entirely to children's
 
traditions.  Participants from each of the other theme areas who can
 
perform or teach songs, dances, games, crafts, or stories of particu-
lar interest to children may be scheduled to appear occasionally in
 
the Children's area.
 
Fieldworkers should keep the program needs of the Children's
 
Area in mind in recommending participants for "Old Ways"; young tra-
dition-bearers, both domestic and foreign, should be considered as
 
i 
• 
-16-
representatives of children's folklore.  Fieldworkers could also
 
suggest simple toys that could be made or sold in the Children's
 
Area.
 See also the letter from Saucie Melnicove provided you con-
cerning the Area's need for film and videotape materials.
 
B
.
 Ethnic Tours
  
The foreign participants usually tour various communities in
 
the United S
tates for two or three weeks after their appearance at
 
the Festival.  They perform in host communities, sight see, and
 
get a chance to meet with Americans, often those of their own ethnic
 
origin, on a personal level.
 
The fieldworker must choose foreign participants with the tour
 
in mind, tell them about the tour, and provide adequate information
 
and photographs to be used for tour publicity.  You will be provided
 
with background information and various statements of tour needs.
 
Early suggestions on possible tour stops will be appreciated, as well
 
as the names and addresses of the newspapers, television and radio sta-
tions that service domestic participants.
 
C
.
 Main Stage and Evening Concerts
  
There is a main stage shared by allareas of the Festival; i
t pro-
vides opportunities for cross-cultural presentations.  Performances may
 
be given there during the day, and "Old Ways" would then be asked to
 
schedule some of its performers on that stage at specified times.
 
•
 • 
0
 
-17-
In addition, each group will perform in an evening concert
 
during the week of their visit.  The fieldworker will need to keep
 
this stage in mind when planning the presentation, and any suggestions
 
or ideas for concerts are welcome.
 
D
.
 Cooperation with Other Areas  
The Festival will be two or three months long this summer and
 
hence require a good deal more fieldwork than in the past.  We anti-
cipate that fieldworkers for different areas of the Festival may
 
cross paths at times.  The fieldworker coordinator will keep you ap-
prised of fieldwork being done for Regional America, Native Americans,
 
and so on, which may be related to your area.
 If it is possible and
 
useful, the areas will try to coordinate and even share the work.
 
You can help by passing on specifics about where you have been doing
 
fieldwork and contacts you have made, as well as where you plan to go
 
in the future.
 I
t will also be important to explain the size and di-
vision of labor of the Festival if you talk with persons who have al-
ready been contacted by another fieldworker, so that people in the
 
communities do not feel they are being innundated by disorganized
 
Smithsonian representatives.
 
E
.
 Scholarly Uses of Festival Material
  
I
f you have any ideas about how the Festival might use its ex-
perience and material to further scholarly and educational aims, feel
 
free to suggest them.

VI.  REPORTS AND COMMUNICATION  WITH "OLD WAYS" STAFF
  
A
.
 Reports
  
The Division of Performing Arts will not consider fieldwork
 
completed until a written report, and full documentation materials
 
have been received.
 
Reports of fieldwork should include:
 
1
.
 A log of travel and activities for the entire fieldwork
 
period.
 
2
.
 A list of all scholars, government officials, community
  
leaders, and others consulted. Give each person"s address
 
and telephone number, the date he or she was contacted,
 
and a sentence or two summarizing your conversation.
 
3
.
 A survey summary consisting of:
 
a
.  An Interview Report Form for each recommended
 
participant.  These forms are available from your
 
program coordinator.  Fieldworkers should recommend
 
participants beyond the maximum number to be in-
vited to the Festival, to allow Festival staff
 
some latitude in making final program decisions.
 
b
.  Background information on all traditions and in-
formation surveyed: social context of traditonal
 
performance, description of musical instruments,
 
description of song and dance styles, and so forth.
 
The Division needs this information to write pub-
licity material, prepare texts for Activities Center
 
exhibits, etc.
 
4
.
 Fieldwork documentation in the form of photographs and
 
cassette recordings.
 Some photographs should be suitable
 
for Festival and tour publicity (
see current list of
 
fieldwork deadlines for specific requirements).  Field-
workers should make an effort to take photographs of po-
tential participants in their traditional context for
 
display in the Activities Center.
 
S
.
 Any materials or suggestions for the Activities Center,
 
food areas, craft area, or concessions.

GUIDELINES FOR PRESENTATIONS, FAF
 
The overall goal of our Festival is to present traditional
 
artists in their very best light.
 
The function of the presenter is to frame every performance
 
by these artists so that audiences unfamiliar with the culture
 
can understand and appreciate the expertise of the performer
 
and the significance of his material.
 
The ultimate goal of the presenter is to send performers
 
back home strengthened and invigorated by the experience of
 
performing before an appreciative and approving audience from
 
the larger community.
 
The responsibilities of the presenter are:
 first, to the
 
well-being of the performers;  second, to the scholarly concerns
 
and values of the Smithsonian; and thirdly, to the refreshment
 
and stimulation of the audiences.
 Most of the time, these three
 
goals are one.
 
The following are some specific ways to fulfill the above
 
strictures.
 
1
.
 No performance on a stage or workshop should take place
 
without a presenter in full-time attendance.
 The overall
 
responsbility for an effective program is yours.
 
2
.
 Try to become familiar as quickly as possible with your
 
performers'  repertoire.
 List it and carry the list with you.
 
Performers often forget their most interesting material and
 
may "dry up" on stage.
 
3
.
 Plan your program at least briefly with the performers
 
involved ahead of time.
 No performer should get up on
 
stage without at least some idea of what he is to do and for
 
how long.
 
4
.
 Do not be afraid to tell your performers quickly and directly
 
if any of their repertoire is unsuitable for performance on the
 
Mall.
 They do not want to be embarrassed by a cool reception.
 
Watch particularly for songs containing ethnic or racial slurs.
 
5
.
 All programs presented on the Mall must include some
 
informational content.
 This can include remarks about the
 
performer's region, the group he represents, his individual
 
history, the type of performance, stylistic points to be noted,
 
etc., etc.
 The performer's registry will include some suggestions
 
that may be useful.
 Such remarks should be brief but should
 
address the educational function of the Smithsonian.
 
guidelines, cont.
 
page 2
 
6
. 
Do not feel, however,  that you need do all the introductory
 
speaking yourself. 
Some of your performers may be eloquent
 
speakers, and even those who know only a few words of English
 
may want to use them.
 
7.
 Plan to include the audience in on the action as much as
 
possible.
 If there are not songs that the audience can join
 
in singing,  teach them the appropriate way of demonstrating
 
approval in the particular culture or a few words of apprecia-
tion in the particular language.
 Children's songs are often
 
very easy to teach;  ask your performers if there are any
 
counting songs in their language which they can teach.
 
8.
 Though there is no need to be solemn, your role is not
  
that of an entertainer.
 Your role is not to amuse but to
 
back up the performer and not risk overwhelming him.
 
9
. 
When you are presenting a performer,  especially when you
 
are on stage,  
- that performance your 100% attention.
 Your
 
behavior cues the audience.
 
•
.
 It is very easy to fall in love with one particular per-
former
- group. 
This is fine for the
extremely demoralizing
 beloved
 to the 
-
 -rs. 
Please
 
try to avo
 - of favoritism in personal attention
 
or in scheduling. 
All performers should, if possible, appear
 
at least 
- on the main Festival stage.
 
11. 
A final 
.ught:
 in pre-rehearsals and as th- Festival ..-
 
along, help your performers dig for their best repertoire. 
Ask
 
them about the oldest songs they know,
help
 
them become aware of their
sys tem
they can take 
-
their own program
 planning.
 
12. 
Come well rested, with your homework already done, and
 
be prepared to stay in focus. 
This is an e
. f
traordinarily in-
tense experience and you will need to call upon all your energies.
