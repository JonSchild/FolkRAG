The Mowing of the HayOh, I am a jolly fellowAs ever you have seen;I've travelled this country
overAnd seen most curious things.Well, I met a fair young damselOnce on my way to town,And I said,
"My lass, I'll cut your grassIf it's never been cut down.""Now, since you are a mower,And mowing
being your trade,I should think you'd find some mowingAmongst so many maids."But I have a little
meadowI've a long time kept in store;It's like the blue grass in Peru,It's never seen the mower."I
took her to a shady spot;And there we did sit down.I took her to a shady spot,And there we did
sit down.I mowed from nine 'til dinner time,And mowed with all my skill,But was forced to yield
and quit the field,For the grass was growing still."Oh, now I'm going to leave you,And from you go
away,And to some distant country,For the mowing of the hay."And when I do return,'Twill be early
in the springWhen the small birds are humming,And the nightingale doth sing.""Oh, I pray you do
not leave me,Oh, don't from me go away,For you know you've got the will of meBy the mowing of my
hay. 2 2 of 2The Mowing of the Hay"And in this little meadow,You've struck no stumps or rocks,And I
pray you do not leave me,'Til you've put my hay in cocks."
