Cut B1
Henry Smith: My name is Henry Smith and I heard the president's speech today and I think it was
wonderful. And I'm on the maintenance staff of City College and I hope to turn up for our forces to
help right the wrong that Japan did to us.
Interviewer: You aren't old enough for the draft were you or too old?
Henry Smith: No, I was in 3-A.
Interviewer: On 3-A. What do you think they're going to do about the deferred people now?
Henry Smith: Well, I know my status will be changed. I know that.
Interviewer: Well, let's see if we can ask the other Mr. Smith something.
Cut B2
Fred Smith: My name is Fred Smith. I'm a maintenance foreman. I heard the president's speech in
the great hall of the college and I thought it would be a little longer, but — and I thought it would be
more forceful. However, it suited me to a T. And I think that, assuming that we get right down to the
business of licking Japan the better it will be for the whole world. The country especially.
Interviewer: What about the other powers —
Fred Smith: That goes for Germany and Italy too. I think that the sooner they're polished off, the
better for the country and the world at large.
Interviewer: ??? Short, sweet, to the point [laughter]. That's very good. Thanks a lot gentlemen.
Cut B3
Sol Shidlinger: My name is Sol Shidlinger. I came to this country three and a half years ago from
Poland. I heard the president's speech and I think that America's fully justified in defending our
possessions. I am sure that my new adopted country is going to need me now. I'm ready to join the

colors of the United States when the need arises despite the fact that there are only a few months
left till I'm going to graduate.
Cut B4 — Test Strip
Taxicab Chauffeur: Now wait a minute. I want to get my wits together. I'm a taxicab chauffeur. And
I'm a veteran of the first world war. I — wait a minute now. Jeez, I forgot, are they holding that up?
Cut B5
Taxicab Chauffeur: I'm a taxicab chauffeur. I'm a veteran of the last World War. When I heard of
the sneaky way the Japs started their aggressive war I was very much shocked. I believe the United
States should try their upmost to beat them, gain a victory, and I'm willing to fight again to do my bit
towards that end.
Cut B6
Electrician: I am a electrician living in New York City and wish to state that if the president of the
United States has taken only five minutes of time of a speech in this crisis that I will take one half
minute in stating that I am full accord with the president. That was the only thing he could do in this
crisis to put the aggressors in their place.
