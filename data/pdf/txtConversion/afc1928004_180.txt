11:3" The Music of all the Songs in this book can be obtained at any 
Music Store in the United States or Canada. 
When Erin first rose from the dark swelling flood, 
God bless'd the green island, and saw it was good; 
The ent'rald of Europe, it sparkled and shone, 
In the ring of the world the most precious stone, 
In her sun, in her soil, in her station thrice blest, 
With her back towards Britain. her face to the West, 
Erin stands proudly insular, on her steep shore, 
And strikes her high harp 'mid the ocean a 
deep roar. 
But when its soft tones seem to mourn and to weep, 
The dark chain of silence is thrown OW1' tne deep; 
At the thought of the pist the tears gush from her eyes, 
And the pulse of her heart makes her white bosom rise. 
! 
sons of green Erin, lament o'er the time, 
When religion was war and our country a 
crime; 
When man in God's image inverted his plan, 
And moulded his God in the image of man. 
When the int'rest of state wrought the general woe; 
The stranger a 
friend and the native a 
foe; 
While the mother rejoic'd o'er her children oppress'd, 
And clasp'd the invader more close to her breast. 
When with pale for the body and pale for the soul, 
Church and state joined in compact to conquer the whole; 
And as Shannon was stained with Milesian blood 
Ey'd each other askance and pronounced it was good. 
By the groans that ascend from your forefathers' grave, 
For their country thus left to the brute and the slave, 
Drive the demon of Bigotry home to hisden, 
And where Britain made brutes now let Erin make men. 
Let my sons like the leaves of the shamrock unite, 
A partition of sects from one foot-stalk of right; 
Give each his full share of the earth and the sky. 
Nor fatten like slaves where the serpent would die. 
Alas! for poor Erin that some are still seen, 
Who would dye the grass red from theirhatred to Green ; 
Yet, oh I 
when you're up and they're down let them live, 
Then yield them that mercy which they would not give. 
Arm of Erin, be strong I 
but be gentle as brave! 
And uplifted to strike, be still ready to save! 
Let no feeling of vengeance presunte to defile 
The cause of, or men of, the Emerald Isle. 
The cause it is good, and the men they are true, 
And the Green shall outlive both the Orange and Blue, 
• 
And the triumphs of Erin her daughters shall share, 
With the full-swelling chest, and the fair-flowing hair. 
Their bosom heaves high for the worthy and brave, 
But leo coward shall rest in that soft.swelling wave; 
Men of Erin ! awake, and make haste to be blest, 
Rise—Arch of the Ocean, and Queen of the West! 
4 
WEEP NOT. 
Oh, weep not for the men who died 
In glory's bright career, 
For laurel wreaths in martial pride 
Have decked their ha:lowed bier ; 
Then let your weeping hearts be dried, 
We'll shed for them no tear. 
Oh, weep not for the men who bled, 
Outnumbered by their toes; 
While proudly o'er each hero-head 
The flag of freedom rose; 
Bright halos round their names are shed, 
Than weep no tears for those. 
Oh, weep not for the exile band 
Who go for evermore, 
Heart-broken from their native laud, 
The broad Atlantic o'er ; 
They fly from grim oppression's hand, 
To seek a 
friendly shore. 
Oh, weep not for the captive men, 
Who pine their lives away 
Within the gloomy prison pen, 
And sorrow-stricken pray ; 
Their freedom soon shall shine again 
In heaven's eternal ray. 
Oh, weep not for the widowed bride, 
The matron and the maid, 
-Whose heart-wrung tears can ne'er be dried 
Till they in earth are laid, 
But pray God's mercy be their guide, 
And He will lend them aid. 
Nor weep for this poor suffering isle, 
With sorrows' gloom o'ereast, 
But ask, with hearts upraised the while, 
how long such gloom will last, 
And pray that soon kind heaven may smile, 
And bid our woes be past. 
Oh, weep not ; there's a 
God above 
Who justice will impart, 
And in His goodness and His love 
Will heal the wounded heart, 
And every ill from us remove 
If we act well our part.

WHY DO YOUNG LOVELY VIRGINS MOURN? 
Why do young lovely virgins mourn, 
Like drooping lilies wet with dew ? 
And why around yon marble urn, 
Spring's choicest roses do they strew ? 
Alas ! the sweetest rose is gone! 
By Shannon's stream it fell : 
The brightest star that ever shone, 
Had bid the sickly earth fat ewell, 
Of Roderick's noble race was she, 
The gentle maid we loved so much, 
And fair she was as eye could see, 
She boasted Nature's finest touch; 
And mild and comely was the youth 
For whom she fondly sigli'd; 
Oh ! timid love and heavenly truth 
Seem'd in this glowing pair allied. 
But sad and fatal was the morn, 
That e're he joined the martial throng, 
Alas! from thence was no return, 
And loud was heard the funeral song, 
Her eye was fix.ed in silent grief, 
Nor long was sorrow's dreatn ; 
For death soon brought the wish'd relief, 
And pluck'd the rose by Shannon's stream. 
DEAR OLD IRELAND. 
Far from the hills of Innisfall 
We meet in love to-night, 
Some of the scattered Cf.,)N NA GAIL, 
With spirits warm and bright. 
Why do we meet ? 'tis to repeat, 
Our vows both night and day 
To dear Old Ireland, brave Old Ireland— 
Ireland, boys, hurrah ! 
We're not the fortune favoured kind, 
But rugged sons of toil, 
We've got the muscle and the mind, 
Ti at's sprung from Irish soil; 
Our toil being done, an 1 
night come on, 
We meet to work and pray 
For dear Old Ireland, brave Old Ireland— 
Ireland, boys, hurrah 
Some left her shores long years ago, 
Some never saw her hills, 
But for her glory and her woe 
Each faithful bosom thrills. 
We give no cheers, but vow her tears 
Revenge shall wipe away— 
! 
dear Ohl Ireland, brave Old Ireland— 
Ireland, boys, hurrah 
We've read of how our fathers fought, 
And how our fathers died: 
How creeds divided where they eugl.t 
To muster side by side. 
And cast the fiend away— 
For dear Old Ireland, brave Old Ireland— 
Ireland, boys, hurrah! „ 
Let cowards bend in abject prayer, 
Let tyrants frown and threat, 
Be ours the duty to prepare 
With swords and bayonet. 
Let babblers cease to prate of peace, 
God send us war we say, 
For dear Old Ireland, brave Old Ireland— 
Ireland, boys, hurrah! 
Our fathers died in olden time 
And left a 
heritage— 
(And loving Ireland was their crime)— 
Of blood and hate and rage; 
And by the cross, there's been no loss, 
We hate as strong as they 
For dear Old Ireland, brave Old Ireland— 
Ireland, boys, hurrah! 
Once more upon the " felon's track," 
Red with our father's blood, 
And woe unto the men, that slack 
Our spirit's burning flood. 
The green above I 
revenge and love 
Forward and march away— 
For dear Old Ireland, brave Old Ireland— 
Ireland, boys, hurrah 
SVBLIME WAS THE WARNING: 
9 
By T110111AS Moms. 
Sublime-was the warning which liberty spoke, 
And grand was the moment when Spaniards awoke 
Into life and revenge from the conqueror's chain i 
Oh, Liberty I 
Let not this spirit have rest„ 
Till it move, like a 
breeze, over the waves of the West— 
Give the light of your looks to each so, ,-awing'spot, 
Nor oh I 
be the Shamrock of Erin forgot, 
While you add to your garland the Olive of Spain 
If the fame of our fathers bequeath'd with their rights, 
Give to country its charm and to home its delights, 
If deceit be a 
wound and suspicion a 
stain— 
Then, ye men of Iberia! our cause is the same; 
And oh! may his tomb want a 
tear and a 
name. 
Who would ask for a 
nobler, a 
holier death, 
Than to turn his last sigh into victory's breath 
For the Shamrock of Erin and Olive of Spain I 
Ye Blokes and O'Donnels, whose fathers resign'd 
The green hills of their youth, among strangers to find 
That repose which at home they had sigh'd for in vain, 
Join, join in our hope that the flame which you light, 
May be felt yet in Erin, as cairn and as bright; 
And forgive even Albion, while blushing, she draws, 
Like a 
truant, her sword, in the long slighted cause 
Of the Shamrock of Erin and Olive of Spain I 
God prosper the cause 1—oh! it cannot but thrive 
While the pulse of one patriot heart is alive, 
Its devotion to feel, and its rights to maintain, 
Then how sainted by sorrow its martyrs will die 
The finger of Glory shall point where they lie, 
While far from the footstep of coward or slave, 
Tho young Spirit of Freedom shall shelter their grave 
Beneath Shamrocks of I 
rin and Olives of Spain I 
THE PATRIOT MAIDEN. 
An Irish girl in heart and soul, 
I 
love the dear old land; 
I 
honor those who in her cause 
Lift voice, or pen, or hand. 
And may I 
live to see her free 
From foreign lord and knave; 
But Heaven forbid I'd ever be 
The mother of a 
slave. 
God bless the men who take their stand 
In Ireland's patriot host: 
I'd give the youth my heart and hand 
Who serves his country moat; 
And if he fell. I'd rather lie 
Beside him in the grave, 
Than we a 
wealthy loon, and be 
The mother of a 
slave. 
Thro' many a 
blood-red age of woe 
Our Nation's heart has bled; 
But still she makes her tyrants know 
Her spirit is not dead. 
God bless the men who for her sake 
Their life II uti genius gave; 
God bless the mothers of those sous. 
They nurst no dastard slave 
Some on the scaffold place of doom 
For loving Ireland died; 
And others to the dungeon-gloom, 
'Are torn from our side: 
But God the Just, who ne'er design'd 
His image for a 
slave, 
Will give our country might and mind, 
And raise the true and brave. 
Ye beauteous daughters of our Isle, 
Whom Heaven with virtue blest 
How can you on a 
helot smile, 
Or clasp him to your breast! 
If you would teach those lessons grand 
The Spartan mothers gave, 
No tyrant. rood would curse the land. 
And you would nurse no slave. 
The son is Sinking to the sea: 
God bless the glorious West. 
Where exiled Irishmen are free, 
And no one is oppress'd! 
Come, sisters, toast that land with me, 
Beyond the world of waves: 
The golden Land of Liberty, 
Where mothers nurse no slaves.

BY MEMORY INSPIRED. 
By memory inspired 
And love of country fired, 
The deeds of M EN I 
love to dwell upon; 
And the patriotic glow 
Of my Spirit must bestof 
A tribute to O'Connell that is 'gone, toys, gone: 
Here's a 
memory to the friends that are goub. 
In October 'Ninety-Seven— 
May his soul find rest in Heaven— 
William Orr to execution was led on: 
The jury, drunk, agreed 
That Laski was his creed ; 
For pedury and threats drove them on,. boys, on: 
Here's the memory of John Mitchel that is gone! 
In 'Ninety-Eight—the month July— 
The informer's pay was high; 
When Reynolds gave the gallows brave MacCann; 
But MacCann was Reynolds' first— 
One could not allay his thirst ; 
So he brought up Bond and Byrne that are gone, boys, gone: 
Here's the memory of the friends that are gone! 
We saw a 
nation's tears 
Shed for John and Henry Shears; 
Betrayed by Judas, Captain Armstrong ; 
We may forgive, but yet 
We never can forget 
The poisoning ot Maguire that is gone, boys, gone: 
Our high Star and true Apostle that is gone! 
How did Lord Edward die 
Like a 
man, without a 
sigh! 
But he left his handiwork on Major Swan! 
But Sirr, with steel-clad breast, 
And coward heart at best, 
Left us c 
luso to mourn Lord Edward that is gone, boys, gone: 
Here's the memory of our friends that are gone. 
September, Eighty-Three, 
Closed this cruel history, 
When Emmet's blood the scaffold flowed upon: 
0! had their zpirits been wise, 
They might then realize 
lgone: 
Their freedom—but we drink to Mitchel that is gone, boys, 
Here's the memory of the friends that are gone. 
THIGGIN TIIU P* 
By 
T. 
D. 
SULLIVAN. 
Oh, Freedom is a 
glorious thing; 
Even so our glorious rulers say, 
And what they say, sure I 
may sing, 
In quite a 
legal proper way. 
They praise it up with all their might, 
And praise the men who seek it, too, 
Provided all the row and fight 
Are out in Poland : Thiggin thu? 
And here is what my s'Ing shall be— 
Success to all the bold and brave, 
Who war for rightful liberty; 
Who vill not have their land a 
slave. 
Success to all who rise to strike 
Down to the dust the tyrant crew, 
With sword and musket, scythe and pike, 
That 
Poland: Thigginthu? 
The men whose spirit never yields— 
Whose faithful hearts will not resign 
Their memoried valleys, hills, and field 
And give the place to Russian swine: 
Who, scattered over all the earth, 
hold to one purpose firm and true, 
To free the land that gave them birth, 
Their own dear Poland: Thiggin thu? 
Oh, may 1 
see from tower and town, 
Before the flash of patriots steel. 
The foreign flag go tumbling down, 
The foreign squadrons backward reel; 
And lifted to its rightfill,place, 
High into Heaven's dazzling blue, 
The banner of the brave old race— 
But all in Poland : Thigginthu? 
And when the bloody strife is o'er, 
And rest succeeds to glorious toil, 
May peace be theirs for evermore 
Who'll have font hold their native soil. 
The world. will bless and praise their name, 
But men of Ireland, what say you? 
Would you be proud to do the same-
1 
mean in Poland: Thiggin, thu? 
*An Irish phrase, meaning. " Do you understand!"

WATCH AND WAIT. 
By 
C. 
G. 
DUFFY 
Ain :—" Tow, row, row." 
Sadly as a 
muffled drum, 
Toiled the hours of long probation; 
Let them toll, the stable soul 
Can work and wait to build a 
nation. 
Curse or groan, 
Never more shall own 
But our stiflen hearts are patient 
As a 
stone. 
Yes, asl patient as a 
stone, 
Till we're struck in hate or ire; 
Then the dint will fall on flint 
And send them back a 
stream of fire. 
Wait, boys, wait, 
Ready for your fate, 
Prompt as powder to the linstock 
Soon or late. 
Let us gather love and help. 
Won from native friends and foemen, 
How little loath the hearts of both, 
We read in many a 
glorious omen. 
No, boys, no; 
Let no word or blow 
Brand a 
native Irish brother 
As our foe. 
Holy Freedom's pealing voice 
Willing *laves bath never woken; 
Ireland's trance was ignorance, 
And KNOWLEDGE all her spells bath broken. 
Hell and night 
Vanish from her sight. 
As when God pronounced aforetime, 
Be there light. 
Cherish well this sacred flame, 
Feed its lamp with7care and patience, 
From God it came, its destined aim, 
To burst the fetters off the nations. 
Now, boys, now, 
Wny should we bow, 
When the promised day is dawning, 
Aud that's now. 
Brothers, if this day should set, 
Another yet must crown our freedom; 
271.at will come, with roll of drum, 
And trampling files with }tux to lead them 
Who can save 
Renegade or slave, 
Fortune only twines her garlands 
For the brave. 
THE MEMORY OF THE DEAD. 
Who fears to speak of Ninety-Eight I 
Who blushes at the name ? 
When cowards mock the patriot's fate, 
Who hangs his head for shame I 
Re's all a 
knave, or half a 
slave, 
Who slights his country tons; 
But a 
true man, like you, man, 
Will fill your glass with us. 
We drink the memory of the bravo. 
The faithful and the few— 
Some lie far off beyond the wave— 
Some sleep in Ireland, too. 
All— all are gone—but still lives on 
The fame of those who died— 
All true men, like you, men, 
Remember them with pride. 
Some on the shores of distant lands 
Their weary hearts have laid, 
And by the stranger's heedless hands 
Their lonely graves were made. 
But, though their clay he far away 
Beyona the Atlantic loam— 
In true men, like ydu, men. 
Their spirit's still at home. 
The dust of some is Irish earth; 
Among their own they rest; 
And the same land that gave them birth 
Has caught them to her breast; 
And we will pray that from their clay 
Full many a 
race may start 
Of true men, like you. men, 
To act as brave a 
part. 
They rose in dark and evil days 
To right their native land ; 
They kindled here a 
living blaze 
That nothing shall withstand. 
Alas! that Might can vanquis:z Right— 
They fell and passed away; 
But true men, like yon, men, 
Are plenty here to•day. 
Then here's their memory—may it ho 
For us a 
guiding light, 
To cheer our strife for liberty, 
And teach us ' to unite. • 
Through good and ill, be Ireland's still, 
Though sad as theirs, your fate; 
And true men, be you, men, 
Like those of Ninety-Eight.

OUR PRIESTS. 
By 
T. 
D. 
SULLIVAN. 
Oh say, young Irish Priests, and you, 
Young Levites of the Irish race, 
Say, is this hateful story true: 
They speak it to your very face— 
They say the past is past indeed— 
That now, as in the days of yore, 
You preach, you pray, you teach, you read, 
But care for Ireland's Nvrongs no more. 
And we, who ' midst our sorrows hold 
The ancient hope of Freedom last, 
Are mocked as dreaming- 
tools, and told 
We're beaten now, we're crushed at last. 
We're asked to quench the glorious light 
That cheered our race whole vges through. 
And henceforth take the wrong as right, 
For you have done it— even you! 
Ah, well—a-day if this be so, 
1Ve've fallen. indeed, on gloomy years, 
And Ireland feels the sorest woe 
That ever drew her blood or tears; 
For when the loved old isle was swept 
By shot and sabre, even then 
The cause was sale that close was kept 
Shrilled in the hearts of holy men. 
What has she done, your Motherland— 
Where is her treason, what her crime ? 
How is her cause less fair and grand 
To-day than in the olden time? 
She's poorer, weaker, sadder now— 
A 
nd deem you these are hideous stains— 
Or do you hate her pallid bro W. 
01 shun hex for her rusty chains ? 
Oh no 1 
the queries do you wrong, 
Dear Priests of God ; and holy youth ; 
I 
swear your love is pure and strong 
For every cause of right and truth. 
[11 
OUR PRIESTS,—[CoNcLuDED. 
Before you fly from Ireland's side, 
The foe must pluck your hearts away, 
Pour through your veins some other title, 
And form your flesh of baser clay. 
"Pis true, with many a 
subtle plea 
That might is right, your ears are vexed; 
For robbers strong, on land and sea. 
Can have their friends, and quote their text* 
'Tis true, o'er cot lee, hall, and school, 
A sight %yid sometimes shock your eyes— 
The emblem of the foreign ride 
Beneath whose shadow Ireland dies. 
But oh I 
your hearts are far aloof 
From every sign of 11cl:old's thrall— 
Not yours the banner on the root; 
Not yours the stars upon the vall ; 
Yonr thoughts are with the glorious dead 
Who strove to set your country free; 
Your love is with the men who tread 
The same bold path to Liberty. 
Oh! brave young souls, of this be sure, 
Your country loves and trusts you well ; 
A band so wise, so mild, so pure, 
Are just the last the toe can quell. 
For sonic may taint, and some may stray, 
And some may shun the pains, the loss, 
But fearless o'er the rugged way 
Will press the soldiers of the Cross. 
Pray, brothers, for the dear old land, 
And those who bear the dust and heat ; 
Your words shall strengthen heart and hand., 
And be a 
light unto their feet. 
Pray tor her oft ; and name in love 
DCilr Ireland in your holy Mass, 
And sure as God sits throned above, 
The joy we seek shall come to pass.

The fatal words had been pronounced— 
The noble man must die. • 
Tito' doomed to part with all he loved, 
By cruel Fate's decree, 
His faith was strong—he still believed, 
That Ireland would be tree ! 
His faith was strong— he still believed 
That Ireland \you'd be free! 
Oh ! God, why should so brave a

his noble life thus yield ? 
A patriot would rather die 
Upon the battle-field • 
But cruel judges doom't'l the man— 
Alas ! that it should be, 
Let others emulate him still,

Let others emulate him still, 
Auti Ireland will be tree. 
A Martyr's death is not in vain— 
For, though he is no more. 
And millions more be sacrificed 
As millions have before. 
When Irishmen shall rush to arms, 
Their battle-cry will be: 
" 
Avenge our noble Ennnet's death," 
And Ireland shall be free, 
"Avenge our martyred Emmet's death, 
And Ireland shall be free. 
When despots rule, and bind the chain 
Upon another's hand, 
And Freedom's made a 
mockery 
Throughout the doomed land ; 
Then every patriot should unfurl 
The flag of Liberty— 
Inscribe on it brave "Etinnet's name, 
And fight till Ireland's free. 
Inscribe on it brave Emmet's name, 
And tignt till Ireland s

THE DEATH OF CAROLAN. 
Ant:—" She is far from the Laud." 
There is woe in the isle of the ocean now, 
The young and the old are weeping; 
For Carolan's harp bends the willow bough, 
And the minstrel in death is sleeping. 
He swept the wild lyre with a 
mighty hand; 
And planted a 
wreath of glory 
Round the beads of the brave and good of the land, 
Who shine in their country's story. 
High peace to his soul! may its rest be sweet, 
As to memory the tone of his numbers; 
May the spirit of song and of freedom meet, 
O'er the lone, silent grave, where he slumbers. 
May the angel of liberty come, at 
wave 
O'er his ashes her golden pinion, 
And carry his dust to the heart of the slave, 
Till tyranny loses dominion. 
Bright sunbeams may tall on the days gone away; 
But the future is darkness wearing; 
For the last of the bards bath gone down to clay 
Who sang the bold anthems of Erin.

OUR DEAR, NATIVE ISLAND. 
Written against the Union. 
By E. EYSAGIIT. 
Ant:—" Robinson Crusoo." 
May God in whose hand 
Is the lot of each land— 
Who rules over ocean and dry land— 
Inspire our good king 
Prom his presence to fling 
Ill advisers who'd ruin our Island. 
Don't we feel ' tis our dear native Island 7 
A fertile and a 
fine little Island ! 
May Orange and Green 
No longer- 
be seen 
Distain'd with the blood of our Isla! d! 
The fair ones we prize 
Declare they despise 
Those who'd mak e 
it a 
slavish and vile and ; 
Be their smiles our reward, 
And we'll gallantly guard 
All the rights and delights of our Island--
For, oh I
 ' tis a 
lovely green Island! 
Bright beauties adorn our Island ! 
At St. Patrick's command, 
Vipers quitted our land— 
But he's wanted again in our Island! 
For her interest and pride, 
We 
oft fought by the side 
Of England, that haughty and high land; 
Nay, we dos° again, 
If she'd let its remain 
A 
free and flourishing island. 
But she, like a 
crafty and sly land, 
Dissension excites in our Island, 
And. 'our fends to adjust, 
She'd lay in the dust 
All the freedom and strength of our Island. 
A few years ago, 
(Though now she says no,) 
We agrow41 with that surly and shy land, 
That each, as a 
friend, 
Should the other defend, 
And the crown be the link of each Island! 
'Twas the final state- bond of each Island ; 
Independence we swore to each Island; 
Are we grown so absurd, 
As to credit her word, 
Wheu she's breaking her oath with our - slraid 
Let us steadily stand 
Be our king and our land. 
And it shan't be a 
slavish or vile land; 
Nor impotent Pitt 
Unpunished commit 
An attempt on the rights of our island. 
Eich voice should resound through our Island, 
You're my neighbor. but Bull, this is my land; 
Nature's favorite spot. 
And I'd son el be shot, 
Than surrender the tights of our Island.

THE FEAST OF O'RORK11. 
O'Rorke's noble fare 
Will ne'er be forgot, 
By those who were there, 
Or those who were not. 
His revels to keep, 
We sup and we dine 
On seven score sheep, . 
Fat bulbcks and swine. 
Usquebaugh to our feast, 
In pails is brought up; 
An hundred at least, 
And a 
mether our cup. 
'Tis there is the sport! 
We rise with the light, 
In disorderly sort 
From snoring all night. 
Oh I 
how I 
was tricked ! 
My pipe it was broke 
My pocket was picked, 
I 
lost my new cloak. 
"I'm robbed," exc'aimed Nell. 
"Of mantle and kercher;" 
Why then fare thee well— 
The deil take the searcher. 
Come, harper, strike up, 
But first, by your favour, 
Boy, give us a 
cup, 
Al 1 
this has some flavour." 
O'Rorke's jolly boys, 
Neer dreamed of the matter, 
Till roused by the noise, 
And musical clatter. 
They bounce from their nest, 
No longer will tarry, 
They rise ready drest, 
Without one " Hail Mary." 
They dance in a 
round, 
Cutting capers and romping; 
"Ls a 
mercy the ground 
Didn't burst with their stamping. 
The floor is all wet, 
Their leaps and their jumps, 
Make the water and sweat, 
Splish-splash in their pumps. 
Bless you late and early, 
Laughing O'Henig.an, 
By my hand you dance rarely, 
Margery Grinigan. 
Bring straw for our bed,'' 
Shake it down to our feet; 
Then over it spread 
The winnowing sheet. 
To show I 
don't flinch, 
Fill the bowl up again, 
Then give us a 
pinch 
Of your sneezing a 
Man.. 
Good lord I 
what a 
sight— 
After all their good cheer 
For people to fight 
In the midst ot their beer 
They rise from their feast, 
So hot are their brains--
A 
cubit a 
least 
The length of their skians. 
What stabs and what cuts, 
What clattering of sticks ! 
What strokes on the guts, 
What basting and kicks! 
With cudgels of oak, 
Well hardened in flame; 
4 
hundred hea , s 
broke— 
A hundred legs lame. 
" 
You churl, I'll maintain 
My father built Lusk, 
The castle of Slane, 
And Carrick Drumrusk.

The Earl of Kildare. 
And bloynalta his brother, 
As great as they are,

As far up as Adam— 
She knows that 'tis true."

CARROLL BAWN 
By LEO (J-NO. K . 
CASEY). 
Alit :—" The River Roe," or, " Irish Molly 0." 
'Twas in the town of Wexford 
They sentenced him to uje— 
'Twas in the town of Wexford 
They built the gallows high. 
And there, one sunnuer morning, 
When beamed the gentle dawn„ 
Upon that cursed gibbet, 
They hung my Carroll Bawn. 
Oh. he was true and loyal. 
Oh, he was proud and fair— 
And only nineteen summers 
Shone on his golden hair. 
And when his gallant brothers 
Had grasped the pike in band, 
Where the greeo flag stri•am'd the fairest 
He stood for native land. 
I 
saw hint cross the heather 
With his bold company; 
And from the rising hillside 
He waved his hand to me. 
Then on my wild heart settled 
A load of woe and pain— 
Narrow, its throbbing told me 
We'd never meet again. 
They fought the Saxon foemen 
By Slaney's glancing wave: 
But bautal strength o'erpowered 
The gallant and the brave. 
And in the flight which followed 
That day of misery; 
Sore wounded he was taken, 
My Carroll Bawn Machree. 
On,fareer gair, that ever 
I 
saw the dreadful sight— 
His locks all damply hanging— 
His cheeks so deadly white. 
What wonder if my ringlets 
Were changed from dark to grey; 
Or if the blessed hand of God 
Had ta'en my life away. 
'Twas in the town of Wexford 
They sentenced him , to die— 
'Twas in the town of Wexford 
They built the gallows high. 
'With form erect and manly. 
And look of scor..ful pi ide ; 
For Ireland's faith and ficedom 
My true love nobly died. 
The meadow path is lonely, 
Tlis hearth is cold and dim ; 
And the silent church. -ard blossom 
Blooms softly over him. 
And my heart is over yearning 
For the calm rest coming on: 
When its weary pulse lies sleeping 
Beside my Carroll Bawn.

111.E ' GATHERING OF THE NATION. 
Those scalding tears--those scalding tears 
Too long have fallen in vain— 
Up with the banners and the spears, 
And let the gathered grief of years 
Show sterner stuff than rain. 
The lightning, in that stormy hour 
When forth defiance rolls, 
Shall flash to scathe the Saxon power, 
But melt the links our long, long shower 
Had rusted round our souls. 
To bear the wrongs we can redress 
To make a 
thing of time— 
The tyranny we can repress— 
Eternal by our dastardness 
Were crime— or worse than crime. 
And we, whose best—and worst was shame 
From first to last alike, 
May take, at length, a 
loftier aim, 
And struggle, since it is the same 
To suger—or to strike. 
What hal red of perverted might 
The cruel hand inspires, 
That robs the linnet's eye of sight. 
To make it sing both day and night! 
Yet thus they robb'd our sires, 
By blotting out the ancient lore, 
Where every loss was shown--
Up with the flag I 
we stand before 
The Saxons of the days of yore, 
In Saxons of our own. 
Denial met our just demands I 
And hatred met our love! 
Till now, by Heaven ! for grasp of hands, 
Well give them clash of battle-brands, 
And gauntlet 'stead of glove 
And may the Saxon stamp his heel 
Upon the coward's front. 
Who sheathes his own unbroken steel, 
Until for mercy tyrants kneel, 
Who forced us to the brunt I

THE SISTER OF CHARITY. 
Sister of Charity, gentle and dutiful, 
Loving as seraphim, tender and mild, 
In humbleness strong, and in purity beautiful 
In spirit heroic, in manners a 
child, 
Ever thy love like an angel reposes, 
With hovering wings o'er the sufferer here, 
Till the arrows of death are half-hidden in roses, 
And the hope-speaking prophecy smiles on the bier. 
When life, like a 
vapour, is slowly retiring, 
As clouds in the dawning to heav'n uprolled, 
Thy prayer like a 
herald, precedes him expiring, 
And the cross on thy bosom his last looks behold; 
And oh ! as the Spouse to thy words of love listen, 
What hundredfold blessings descend on thee then— 
Thus the flower absorbed dew, in the bright irisglistens, 
And returns to the lilies more richly again. 
Sister of Charity; child of the holiest, 
0, for thy living soul, ardent as pure. 
Mother of orphans and friend of the lowliest, 
Stay of the wretched, the guilty, the poor ; 
The embrace of the Godhead so plainly enfolds, 
Sanctity's halo so shrines thee around, 
Daring the eye that unshrinking beholds thee. 
Nor droops hi thy presence abashed to the ground. 
Dim is the fire of the sunniest blushes, 
Burning the breast of the maidenly rose, 
To the exquisite bloom that thy pale beauty flushes, 
When the incense ascends and the sanctuary glows,

And the music, that scans heav'ns language, is pealing, 
Adoration has bowed him in silence and sighs, 
And man, intermingled with angels, is feeling 
"lie passionless rapture that comes from the skies. 
Oh, that this heart, whose unspeakable treasure 
Of love hath been wasted so vainly on clay, 
Like thine, unallured by the phantom of pleasure. 
Could rend every earthly affection away ; 
And yet in thy presence, the billows subsiding, 
Obey the strong effort of reason and will, 
And my soul in her pristine tranquility gliding, 
Is calm as when God bid the ocean be still. 
Thy soothing, how gentle, thy pity, how tender, 
Choir music thy voice is—thy step angel grace. 
And thy union with deity shrines in a 
splendor, 
Subtitled, but unearthly thy spiritual face. 
When the frail chains arebroken, acapi ire that bound thee 
Atar from thy home is time prison of clay, 
Bride of the Lamb, and earth's shadows around thee, 
Disperse in the blaze of eternity's day.

Arresting the thunders of wrath ere they roll,

cloud between us and his glory, 
And shield from his lightnings the shuddering :_mottl.

THE WIDOW'S WAIL 
My lannah vocht, your mother's lot 
Is sad and dark to-day, 
While o'er your gory, murder'd corpse, 
I 
sorrowing kneel to pray. 
Your heart is still, ma veel asthore, 
That teem'd with filial love; 
But your spirit yet as loving smiles, 
From regions far above. 
Sure were it in the marshalled ranks, 
The bright steel in your hand, 
You fell, as erst, your fathers fell, 
For this, our plundered land— 
No nameless woe my heart would know, 
But real old Celtic pride, 
That 'neath the flashing, lov'd Green Flag, 
In the good cause you died. 
Pulse of my heart, thy country sees 
flow, by the bravo's stroke, 
Your young life is for ever hushed, 
And my pale sorrow woke! 
You cannot hear, my slaughter'd boy 
The words I 
whisper now, 
The breathings of an injured race, 
Thy brethren's sworn. vow. 
But, ruthless deeds as this will live, 
And fire the nation through. 
And with a 
dread, resistless power, 
Our people's arms endue. 
Then will the long red debt be paid, 
The bitter draught returned— 
The poisoned draught that centuries long 
Our vitals sapp'd and burned. 
OH, THE SIGHT ENTRANCING. 
Oh, the sight entrancing, 
When morning's beam is glancing 
O'er files array'd 
With helm and blade. 
And plumes, in the gay wind dancing! 
When hearts are all high beating, 
And the trumpet's voice repeating 
That song whose breath 
May lead to death, 
But never to retreating. 
Oh, the sight entrancing, 
When morning's beam is glancing 
O'er files array'd 
With helm and blade, 
And plumes in the gay wind dancing. 
Yet, 'tis not helm or feather— 
For ask yon despot, whether 
His plumed bands 
Could bring such hands 
And hearts as ours together. 
Leave pomps to those who need 'em— 
Give man but heart and freedom. 
And proud he braves 
Time gaudiest slaves 
That crawl where monarchs lead 'cm. 
The sword may pierce the beaver, 
Stone walls in time may sever, 
'Tis mind alone, 
Worth steel and stone, 
That keeps men free forever. 
Oh, that sight entrancing, 
When the morning's beam is dancing., 
O'er files array'd 
With helm and blade, 
And in Freedom's cause advancing!

THE COULIN. 
The last time she looked in the face of her dear, 
She breathed not a 
sigh, and she shed not a 
tear; 
Butsbe took up his harp, and she kissed his cold cheek-
'6'Tis the first, and the last, for thy Norah to seek." 
For beauty and bravery Cathan was know'n, 
And the long flowing coulin he wore in Tyrone; 
The sweetest of singers and harpers was h 
All over the North, from the Bann to the sea-
O'er the marshes of Dublin he often would rove, 
To the Glens of O'Tool, where he met with his love; 
And at parting they pledged that, next midsummer day, 
lie would come for the last time, and bear her away. • 
The king had forbidden the men of O'Neal, 
With the coulin adorned, to come o'er the pale; 
But Norah was Irish, and said, in her pride, 
" 
If he wear not this coulin, I'll ne'er be his bride." 
The bride has grown pale as the robe that she wears, 
For the Lammas is come, and no bridegroom appears: 
And she hearkens and gazes, when all are at rest, 
For the sound of his harp and the sheen of his vest. 
Her palfrey is pillioned, and she has gone forth 
On the long rugged road that leads down to the North ;— 
Where Eblana's strong castle frowns darkly and drear, 
Is the head of her Cathan upraised on a 
spear. 
The Lords of the Castle had murdered him there, 
And all for the wearing that poor lock of hair; 
For the word she had spoken in mirth or in pride, 
Her lover, too fond and too faithful, had died. 
'Twas then that she looked in the face of her dear, 
She breathed not a 
sigh, and she dropped not a 
tear; 
She took up his harp, and she kissed his cold cheek; 
"Farewell! ' tis the first for thy Norah to seek." 
And afterward, oft would the wilderness ring, 
As at night, in sad strains, to that harp she would sing 
Iler heartbreaking; tones,—we remember them well— 
But the words of her wailing no mortal can telL

THE DAY-DREAMER. 
What joy was mine in the gallant time, 
When, I 
was an Outlaw bold ! 
Girt wiih my clan in the glades of Truagh; 
Or shut in my castle-hold 
In solemn Fels, with the Brehos gray, 
And the stalwart Chiefs of old. 
How many a 
tranced hour I 
sat 
At the feet of the Soldier Saint; 
On drank high hopes from our dauntless Hugh 
That cordial the heart of the faint; 
Or wove bold plots with untiring Tune, 
To blot out the Isle's 
ttaint. 
What deeds we vowed to the dear old land! 
What solemn words we spoke; 
Bow never we'd cease or sleep in peace 
"fill we shattered the stranger's yoke; 
And not with a 
storm of windy words, 
But many a 
soldier stroke. 
We'd knotted whips for the Saxon churls, 
And steel for the Norman peers, 
And a 
gallows high for the pampered priests 
Who were drunk with the peasants tears— 
And the Towers grim where the Robbers haired, 
We dashed them about their ears! 
We 
lifted the buried harp anew 
With its guardian spear and skeane, 
And forth we sent to the listening : and , 
Full many a 
mystic strain, 
Which scattered the slavish fear away 
That hung on its breast like a 
chain. 
The torrent's voice in the slumb'ring night 
Is tame to the words we spake,— 
The tempest words in whose fiery breath 
The thrones and dominions shake; 
Till lo! from their sleep the people rose, 
And their chains like a 
reed they brake. 
It stirs me still, that solemn sight 
Of the proud old land made free; 
Our flag afloat from the castles tall, 
And the ships on the circling sea— 
And the joyful voice, like a 
roil of drums, 
Of the Nation's jubilee 1

LAMENT FOR GRATTAN. 
Shall the Harp then be silent, when he who first gave 
To our country a 
name, is withdrawn from all eyes ? 
Shall a 
Minstrel of Erin stand mute by the. grave, 
Where the first— where the last of the patriots lies ? 
No— faint tho' the death-song may fall from his lips, 
Tho' his Harp, like his soul, may with shadows be crost, 
Yet, yet shall it sound, 'mid a 
nation's eclipse, 
And proclaim to the world what a 
star hath been lost;— 
What a 
union of all the aflections and powers 
By which life is exalted, embellisli'd, refined, 
Was embraced in that spirit— whose centre was ours, 
1VIiile its migloy circumference circled mankind. 
011, who that loves Erin, or who that can see, 
Through the waste or her annals, that epoch sublime— 
Like a 
pyramid raised hi the desert—where he 
And his glory stand out to the eyes of all time ; 
That one lucid interval, snateli'd from the gloom 
And the nuttiness of ages, when fill'd with his soul, 
A Nation o'erleap'd the dark bounds of her doom, 
And for one sacred instant toucli'd Liberty's goal ? 
Who, that ever hath heard lihn—hath drank at the source 
Of that wonderful eloquence, all Erin's own, • 
Whose high-thoughted daring. the fire, and the force, 
And the yet untamed spring of her spirit are shown ? 
An eloquence rich, wheresoever its wave 
Wander'd free 
and triumphant, with thoughts that 
shone thro' 
As clear as the brook's " stone of lustre," and gave, 
With the flash of the gem, its solidity too. 
Who, that ever approach' him, when free from the crowd, 
In a 
home full of love he delighted to tread 
'Mong the trees which a 
nation had giv'n, and which bow'd 
As it each brought a 
new civic crown for his head— 
Is there one who had thus. through his orbit of life 
But at a 
distance observed him—through glory, through 
blame, 
In the calm of retreat. In the grandeur of strife, 
Whether shining or clouded, still high and the same,— 
Oh no. not a 
heart that e'er knew him, hut mourns 
Deep, deep o'er the grave where such glory is stained— 
O'er a 
monument Fame will preserve, 'inong the urns 
Of the wisest, the bravest, the best of mankind I 
'TWOULD NOT DO. 
I've tried to fool myself into 
The fond conviction that we be 
The happiest race, most blest, most free 
Upon the globe—but '
twould not do. 
Dispassionately, coolly, too, 
I've combated with common sense, 
The Saxon's scourge and insolence 
I 
gloss'd o'er, but 'twould not do. 
I 
sat and reasoned with the view 
To prove the Saxon's innocence— 
To prove the Celt's improvidence 
And worthlessness, but 'twould not do. 
HOPE FOR IRELAND. 
Dear land, though the cold and the timid condemn 
We 
shall struggle for thee in defiance of them; 
'Till we hail thee as free as the eagle whose eye 
Is exultingly turned to his home in the sky! 
And like the wild eagle, when guar-ding his nest, 
We'll shield thee in danger or die on thy breast, 
Until thy last foeman hath fled from thy shore, 
And thy days of dissension and thraldom are o'er. 
And then, like that eagle, when scanning afar 
The eyrie he knows that no mortal can mar— 
Thy sons shall look down from thy land's highest peak 
On the plains where a 
tyrant in vain they shall seek.

MY FENIAN LADY. 
I 
entered the dismal, blinded house, 
Through fifty yews. and across the lawn, 
Just as Orion began to set, 
And the East gave flush of a 
sullen dawn. 
I 
heard the wren and robin betimes 
Pipe in the laurels, and, underneath, 
Smelt marigolds in a 
breast of fire. 
Their odor, the odor of spotless death. 
Up the ten steps of the grim old house, 
With its crooked chimneys and gables stark, 
Under the flaring light in the hail, 
Then, higher still, through the staircase dark, 
And there you lie in the snowy folds 
Of habit and milk-white coverlet, 
One rosary in your sweet. thin hand, 
Darling, 1'41 blush to call you pet. 
For you, bright woman, no more are mine; 
We travel hence, by a 
different road. 
All your earth's fragrance came to me, 
All your soul's beauty grew to God. 
I 
see you lean on the golden stair, 
The lilies held twixt your finger tips, 
Your eyes downcast and your brow abased, 
And the cry of rejoicing on your lips. 
The shining raiment, white as the sun, 
Waves thin and cloudlike, and disappears. 
1 
stand in the outer darkness, I, 
Failing of motive for grief or tears; 
God, I 
say to my innermost self, 
Will keep her spotless and sweet for me: 
Perhaps the crown of heroic life, 
In the time and the world that are to be. 
But there you sleep, and the pure round lids, 
Shelter the violets of your eyes, 
Your bosom in maidenhood's bounteous bloom, 
Your face so tenderly, sadly wise. 
There are the feet that I 
loved so much, 
Their innocent patter henceforth I 
miss; 
This is the arm that ran round my neck, 
And this is the mouth that I 
used to kiss. 
I 
often thought in the days gone by, 
If ever I 
had to lean upon 
The stricken grief of a 
stricken man, 
I'd shun both Browning and Tennyson. 
1VIY FENIAN LADY.—[CONCLUDED. 
Sit down and write my soul on a 
leaf, 
As the autumn reddens its pi hit on the beech, 
Sit down, and, whilst I 
told out my wrong, 
Let the Laureate and his colleague preach. 
But now that the mortal grief has come, 
My lips are frozen, my words arc dead; 
I 
lay my hand on the sweet bright hair— 
The holy brow of a 
beautiful head. 
What the clear eyes, that lie all entranced 
See, is not given to us to see, 
Some other man, in my heart I 
say, 
Must tell this story aright for inc. 
The hate that hates, and the love that loves, 
The upward motion that ever strives, 
Were sweet, as tar as I 
dare to guess. 
The mystic multiples of our lives. 
Of t 
lie better portion I 
stand bereft 
Of the dainty lightness, the pure home grace, 
Stark, as is one of the darkened stars 
That, fireless, wheel through the rounds of space. 
Had I 
but known you, all self contained, 
Heedless of Ireland's myriad wrongs, 
Never giving her place a 
name 
In meditations or evening songs, 
I 
could coquet anti I 
could Lingo, 
You'd have been Henie's dear to me, 
Dressed in a 
bodice of creamy lace, 
Heedless of what was, what might be. 
0, love, you suffered and wrought with us, 
Now you are dead, I 
remember all, 
The sidelong whisper beside the stair, 
The parting kiss in the Janina hall. 
"Save her, save her, save her," you said, 
" 
Our country dragged to the felon's doom, 
Save her, our kindly motherland, 
And her lap of shamrocks will find you room." 
Dead ! and the silent morning shines, 
Dead 
and the larks high up in the air, 
Dead ! and the querulous wayside brook 
Makes a 
flame in the east's clear glare.' 
What of the world is lost or changed ? 
(Here is the situ and the daybreak's red), 
Nothing. nothing, nothing, I 
know, 
Only 1 
question that she is dead. 
[2] 
ANOTHER. DEAD. 
Another dead—and tearless eyes 
Can look upon the sacrifice— 
Anwher dead for Ireland's cause— 
Dead by the force of alien laws ; 
Not murdered on the galows tree; 
N t 
as a 
solder's death should bs— 
SVi 
blazing battle- flags above. 
'Mid cries of fierce avenging love. 
But in the thrkness and the gloom 
That shrouds tin Saxon prison tomb. 
Another dead! the time flies fast, 
That leads unto the dawn at last. 
How did he die ? 
The angels brought 
him gushing streams of heavenly thought, 
Bor God, who marked the struggle first, 
And year and year that struggle nursed, 
Until, in Titan strength arw,e. 
Through the dark mist of myriad woes, 
The childru of a 
new Israel, 
Who never learned to whine or quail— 
Who never knelt to Pagan stone. 
That God had marked hint for His own. 
I 
stand within a 
shadowy space 
That girds a 
kingly dwel um-place ; 
'I see the light of s;ars fall through 
The tr-ckless vault of midnight blue. 
And round and round in saintly row 
Shine the brave forms of long ago, 
From Brian, with his conquering brand, 
To the three who die I 
for dear Ireland, 
And through the star-emblazoned air 
I 
see him sitting calmly there. 
The fight is fought and all is past; 
The crown is on his brow at last, 
And thouji the dream of hope and pride 
For whielt he strove— for which he died— 
Is unfulfilled. another light 
Spreads swiftly o'er the cloud-robed night. 
And other anthems strike the skies, 
And other banners proudly rise, 
And a 
fair hand is lifted up 
To dash to earth the poisoned cup. 
I 
knew him, said the Vanithee— 
He sat upon my aged knee; 
I 
knew him, said the patriarch old— 
His words to me were dear as gold; 
The spring rain falls on bill and plain, 
his spring shall never come again 
To rain upon this heart of mine 
Words soft as milk and sweet as wine. 
God bless him I 
said the stalwart youth, 
In the first dawn of hope and truth, 
Would I 
could march unto the goal 
With the same firmness of soul ; 
'Would I 
could stand as he has stood, 
A rock against a 
roaring flood. 
Would I 
conld fight the fight as he, 
For Ireland and for Liberty, 
equieseat in pace now, 
The palm is resting on his I 
row. 
And I 
amid the mourners pass, 
One, thronging through a 
surging mass, 
And dream I 
see his clear dark eye 
Fixed on me full and passionately. 
And dream I 
feel his clasped band— 
The truest clasp in all the land— 
Far down within the valleyed west, 
Seated on some grey mountain crest: 
We talk of Ireland and her wrongs, 
And sing our love in treasured songs. 
But all is past— no more, no more 
We meet upon this earthly shore, 
Write not his epitaph ; the seal 
Of his great soul none can reveal ; 
He loved his God; with true man's pride, 
For Ireland lived and Ireland died. 
DAVIS.-
I 
stand beside thy tomb, 
Lost chieftain of our race— 
No dull abode of gloom, 
This thy last resting-place; 
The golden sunlight streams, 
Upon that marble brow; 
And there in fancy's dreams, 
Bright thoughts seem gathering now. 
Brother bards have sung thy nation's anguish-moan: 
A kindred soul impressed thy form upon the stone I 
But oh I 
the kindling glance, 
The lovelight of thine eye; 
Thy footstep's firm advance; 
The greeting or reply— 
The hand of frien ily grasp. 
The vice of thrilling tone— 
Within death's leaden clasp 
All these, alas ! are gone! 
And yet! thy lightning thoughts still our hearts shall warm, 
And be to freedom's barque a 
life-light in the sterni. 
Full fain would I 
believe 
That o'er the poet's grave 
The fading hues of eve, 
Their softest'ShadOwt weave; 
And when at midnight dim, 
Wild tempests groaning risa, 
That piercing wails for him 
Ascend he darkened skies. 
But sweeter ' tis to. know his spirit lives e 
shrined 
Within a 
nation's heart—and in his people's mind. 
IIINEEN THE ROVER: 
An old castle towers o'er the billow 
That thunders by Cleena's green land, 
And there dwelt as gallant a 
rover 
As ever grasped hilt by the hand. 
Eight stately towers of the waters 
Lie anchored in Baltimore Bay, 
And over their twenty score sailors, 
Oh, who but the Rover holds sway ? 
Then, ho I 
for Fineen the Rover! 
Pitmen O'Driscoll the free ! 
Straight as the mast of his galley, 
And wild as the wave of the sea. 
The Saxons of Cork and Moyallo, 
They harried his lands with their powers; 
He gave them a 
taste of his cannon, 
And drove them like wolves from his towers. 
The men of Clan London brouglit over 
Their strong fleet to make him a 
slave; 
They met hint by Mizen's wild highland, 
And the sharkscrunehed their bones ' neath the wave 
Then Ito ! for Fineen the Rover! 
Fineen O'Driseoll the free; 
With step like the red stag of Beata, 
And voice like the bold sounding sea. 
Long time in that old battered castle, 
Or out on the waves whit his elan ; 
fie feasted, and ventured, and conquered, 
But ne'er struck his colors to man. 
In a 
fight ?gainst the foes of his country 
lie died as a 
brave man should die; 
And he sleeps ' neath the waters of Cleena, 
Where the waves sing his caoine to the sky! 
Then ho! for Fineen the Rover, 
Fineen O'Driseoll the free; 
With eye like the osprey's at morning, 
And smile like the sun on the sea.

Aiiel name him no more unto' loyalty's ear, 
his story has tarnished the shield of Kildare; 
And the doom meted out to a 
patriot here. 
Is more than the pride of their lineage can bear. 
Let his fate be the meed of his honor and worth, 
Of the spirit and daring that all were his own; 
What need they the meneries his name may bring forth 
So they bask in the light of a 
foreigner's throne? 
'Twere well that he trod in the slave-beaten path, 
Nor heeded the wail of his country's despair; 
Had he stalked with the weight of an enemy's wrath, 
O'er the corpse of the land that lay quivering there. 
But to strike for the doom'd, for the serf. for the slave, 
Is a 
crime with the lordlings of old Innisfail. 
A soldier, an envoy, their honor May save, 
But Lord Edward flies up like a 
waif in the scale. 
"'Forgot be the deeds of the Desmond of old; 
For Leinster is scathed by a 
Geraldine's name; 
,And perish—so pleasure be purchased for gold— 
The love of Fitzgerald—the Geraldine's fame," 
Let this be their motto; but Erin her own, 
Will proudly uphold through the future's long years 
And the name of her chief to the Deity's throne, 
Will be wafted 'mid sorrow, imici auger, and tears.'

know ye the wish.ot the proud ? 
'Tis to empty their veins, 
'Mid the crashing of chains, 
Ay. the veins of their heart, if allowed, 
So the neck of oppression be bound— 
What a 
holy wish that of the proud! 
Then hurrah for the wish of the brave, the brave' 
Hurrah for the wish of the brave! 
And hurrah for the hand, 
And the casque-cleaving brand, 
That the rights of a 
nation can save, 
Or redeem by its world-lightening wave— 
Heaven bless the broad brand of the brave! 
TO FRIENDS AT HOME. 
I 
thank you most sincerely, friends, 
I 
thank you all.to-day; 
For thoughts and tears and holy prayers 
That have tracked the exile's way. 
For wishes that have followed him, 
Where'er his footsteps wend, 
And most of all I 
thank you 
For the Shamrocks that you send. 
I 
greet the little wanderer, 
No longer poor or banned; 
And closely to my heart I 
press 
The emblem of my land. 
And gaze ,upon the triple leaf 
With wistful, longing eyes; 
And as it were a 
fellow-man, 
Address it in this wise : 
Methinks as 'long the parapet 
You stole, your footsteps fell 
Right clearly on the list'lling ear 
Of the pacing sentinel. 
Right clearly, too, lie heard the splash, 
As you swain across the moat, 
And little dreamed a 
rebel hid 
Beneath the • W ARDER's' coat. 
Oh ! Shamrock, little Shamrock, 
My blessing be on you. 
You mind me amid strangers here 
Of warm hearts and ti no— 
You mind me of a 
happier time, 
And so my thoughts will stray 
To the sunny hills of Ireland 
And the old friends far away.'

THE BISHOP OF ROSS.

Dread tidings from cabin to cabin convey ; 
But loud tho' the plaints and the shrieks Nvhiel; ensue, 
The war cry is louder of men in array. 
In the park of Macroorn there is gleaming of steel 
Awl glancing of lightning in looks on that field, 
And swelling of bosoms with patrioezeal, 
And clenching of hands on the weapons they wield.

The post of the pastor's in front of the fold 
When the wolf's on the plain and there's rapine to fear.

The danger is come, and the fortune of war 
Inclines to the side of oppression once more ; 
The people are brave—but they fall, and the star 
Of their destiny sets in the darkness of yore. 
MarEgan survives in the Philistine hands 
Of the lords of the pale, and his death is decreed ; 
But the sentence is stayed by Lord Broghill's command, 
And the prisoner is dragged to his presence with speed.

IRELAND IN 1872. 
Apart from all the nations still she stands, 
fn pride and sorrow that are comfortless; 
The halt- broke fetters still upon her hands. 
Her head bowed down in seeming hopelessness. 
Yet not all conquered. for she still can feel 
The hopes whose glory lit her ancient pages; 
And glimpses °film past upon her steal, 
Glimmering and broken by the woes of ages. 
The hopes that shone in her far history. 
Like stars whose splendour was not made to die, - 
Grown for a 
moment into glorious day. 
- 
Have gleaned upon her from the troubled sky. 
From the base dust wher, she had sitten down 
In feebleness and gloom, behold her risen ; 
And the bright shadow of a 
brighter crown 
Than e'en she wore, is gleaming o'er her prison. 
She hears the voice of Freedom from afar, 
Mingled with her own children's dearer voices, 
And o'er the ocean trembling like a 
star. 
Beholds the hope would free her, and rejoices. 
We thought her dead— that brave old land of ours, 
Dead with a 
death front which there was no morrew: 
In i
trief anti stulenesss we watched the hours 
Pass by us with their leads of hopeless sorrow. 
Thy chidren planted in a 
soil more free. 
To which despair had driven them and madness, 
Those hopes which like seed sown return to thee [ floss. 
Glowing with more than youthful strength and glad. 
Oh, think not e'er, ye tyrants of the earth, 
To quench the hopes that glorious Freedom give; 
In every pang a 
new immortal birth 
Of during thoughts declares that Freedom lives. 
We were not made for slaves, and mock us not 
With lofty names— we cannot, thus be fool'd, 
We have a 
history still untorgot, 
And know the " liberty" with which we're ruhal. 
Make tight your fetters-in the bleeding land, 
Make poorer still the cabins of the poor; 
The homeless desert stretch from strand to straud, 
And then your power and triumph are secure.

While you munched to the tune of' the old milking croon, 
How often you left the green side of the hill.

And often I 
freed you before the grey dawn, 
Front your snug little bed at the edge of the lawn. 
But they racked and they ground me with tax and witt.

To-day they have finished ; and on the wide world. 
With the mocking of fiends from my home was I 
hurled.

knelt down three times for to utter a 
prayer, 
But my heart it was seared, and the words were not there; 
Oh ! wild were the thoughts through my dizzy head came, 
Like the rushing of wind through a 
forest of flame. 
I

PATRICK SHEEHAN. 
My name is Patrick Sheehan, 
My years are thirty-four ; 
Tipperary is my native place, 
Not far from Gal tymore. 
I 
came of honest parents— 
But now they're lying low— 
And many a 
pleasant day I 
spent 
In the Glen of Alterlow. 
My father died ; I 
closed his eyes 
Outside our cabin-door; 
The landlord and the sheriff too 
Were there the day before— 
And then my loving mother, 
And sisters three also, 
Were forced to go with broken hearts 
From the Glen of Alterlow. 
For three long months. in search of work, 
I 
wandered far and near; 
I 
went then to the poor-house 
For to see my mother dear. 
The news I 
heard nigh broke my heart, 
But still, in all my woe, 
I 
blessed the friends who made their grave 
In the Glen of Alterlow. 
Bereft of home, and kith, and kin— 
With plenty all around-
1 
starved within my cabin, 
And slept upon the ground 
But cruel as my lot was, 
1 
ne'er did hardship know, 
'Till I 
joined the English army, 
Far away from Aherlow. 
"Rouse up there," says the Corporal, 
" 
You lazy II Irish hoond, 
Why don't you hear, you sleepy dog, 
The call 
to anus' sound ?"

Of days long, long ago,

And not in Aherlow.

0 blessed God, it was not dark,

And when I 
tonnd that I

Mine is a

A poor blind prisoner here I

In Dublin's dreary jail ; 
Struck blind within the trenches, 
Where I 
never ( eared the foe ; 
And now I'll never see again 
My own sweet Aherlow ! 
A poor neglected mendicant 
I 
wandered through the street, 
My nine months' pension now being out, 
I

As I

My face t

ARTHUR rilcCOY. 
While the snow flakes of whiter are falling, 
On mountain, and house- top and tree, 
Come, olden weird voices, recalling, 
The homes of lly-faly to me. 
The ramble by river and wild- wood, 
T•te legends of mountain and glen. 
When the bright magic mirror of childhood, 
Made heroes and giants of men. 
Then I 
had my dreaming ideal, 
My prophets and heroes sublime. 
Yet I 
found one, true, living and real, 
Surpass all the fictions of time; 
Whose voice thrilled my heart to its centre, 
Whose form tranced my soul and my eye, 
A temple no treason could enter, 
3.ly hero was Arthur McCoy. 
For Arthur MeCoy was no beggar. 
No hither, no blustering clown. 
'Fore the club of an al.-house to swagger, 
Or drag his coat-: ail through the town; 
But a 
veteran stern and steady, 
Who felt for the land and her ills, 
In the hour of her need ever ready, 
To shoulder a 
pike for the hills. 
As the strong mountain tower spread its arms, 
Dark, shadowy, silent, and tall. 
In our tithe-raids and midnight alarms, 
his bosom gave refuge to all! 
If a 
mind clear, and calm, and expanded, 
A soul ever soaring and high, 
'Mid a 
hqst—gave a 
right, to command it— 
A hero was Arthur McCoy. 
Whilst he knelt with a 
ehristian demeanor 
To his priest, or his Maker alone, 
lie scorned the vile slave or retainer, 
That crouched ronnd the castle or throne. 
The Tudor, the Guelph, the pretender, 
Were tyrants alike, branch awl stem ; 
But who'd free our fair land. awl delen4 her, 
A 
nation, were monarchs to him. 
[

ARTHUR BleCOY.—[CONCLUDED. 
And this faith in good works he attest(td. 
When Tone linked the true hearts and brave, 
Every billow of danger he breasted, 
his sword flash, the crest of its wave; 
A standard he captured in Gorey, 
A sword cut and ball through the thigh, 
Were among the mementoes of glory, 
Recorded of Arthur McCoy. 
Long th ,
_t quest of the law and its beagles, 
His covert the cave and the tree ; 
Though his home was the home of the eagles, 
ills soul was the soul of the free. 
No toil, no defeat could enslave it. 
Nor franchise, nor " Amnesty Bill "— 
No lord, but, the Maker who gave it, 
Could curb the high pride of his will. 
With the gloom of defeat ever laden— 
Seldom seen nt the hurling or dance, 
Where. t' trough blushes, the eye of the maiden 
Looks out for her lover's advance; 
And whenever he stood to behold it, 
A end of the lip or a 
sigh, 
Was the silent reproach that unfolded 
The feelings of Arthur McCoy. 
For it told him of freedom o'shaded— 
That the iron had entered their veins, 
„When beauty bears manhood degraded, 
And manhood's contented in chains. 
Yet he loved that fair race as a 
martyr, 
And it' his own death could recall, 
The blessing of liberty's charter, 
His bosom had bled for them all. 
And he died for his love—I 
remember, 
On a 
mound by the Shannon's blue wave, 
On a 
dark snowy eve of December, 
I 
knelt at the patriot's grave. 
The aged were all beavy-hearted— 
No cheek in the church-yard was dry, 
The sun of our hills ha i 
departed— 
God rest you, old;Arthur McCoy.

PATRICK'S DAY. 
By Da. R. D. JOYCE_ 
We cannot be glad ; lonely exiles, we borrow 
From pomp and parade but the semblance of glee; 
We cannot be glad, while in serfilom and sorrow 
Our brothers are pining beyond the sea: 
Though gallant and proud, 
Our heads shall be bowed 
When we think, mother Ireland, of them and of thee : 
Though flaunting on high 
Our banners inny fly, 
Though the trumpets may blaze and the drums roll and 
rattle, 
And rifles and bayonets flash bright in the ray, 
They make us but sigh for one good hour of battle 
On green Irish ground upon Patrick s 
Day! 
We cannot be glad, though the pageant's shrill clangor 
From street unto street fill the blue heaven's dome; 
We cannot be glad, but the sounds of our anger 
Shall be heard far away o'er the wild sea's foam,— 
Shall be heard far away 
By the tyrants who sway 
16 the curse of our race and our green Island home— 
Be heard rising clear 
By the despots whose fear 
Will make them imagine our rifles and cannon 
Are over the water beginning the flay, 
That th,.! people had risen from Bann to the Slemnon, 
To try their new strength upon Patrick's day! 
We cannot be glad, but ( he brave hope we cherish 
Of raising the green flag afar o'er the main, 
That the power of the tyrant before us shall perish, 
Assuages our sorrow and soothes our pain. 
So our trumpets shall sound 
All the wide NVOIld round 
With the bold voice of freedom in wrought in the strain, 
And our banners shall gleam 
In each foreign sun's beam, 
sons of one mother, we're banded together 
Vitt: weapons all glittering in warlike array, 
we fight the good fight on our own native heather. 
And win back our freedom on Patrick's Day! 
55 
THIS IS NO TIME FOR T 
EARS. 
This is no time for tears ! the heart be still, 
Hush the deep cry, the spirit's tortured wail, 
Curb the rash impulse, bind the stubborn will, 
Let speechless silence deep as death prevail. 
Chain up revenge, and hatred's countless spawn, 
Like hounds in leash unto the smiter turn 
The other cheek, with feigned caresses fawn 
Upon the foot that trampled us with scorn. 
The foeman filing his gauntlet in our lace, 
Demanding blood for blood, stern blow for blow; 
The day draws nigh that stigma to efface, 
And turn the tide of victory's crimson flow. 
'Tis well to know the worst— the bounds of guilt 
May not be passed, beyond man's weak control, 
The power to add one pang— though blood he spilt, 
The tyrant's sentence cannot reach the soul ! 
Darkly the dull November mist came down. 
Spread forth by angels hands to veil the pyre 
Whereon our martyred brothers won the crown 
Of Him who " walked beside them through the fire r 
Oh, not for them the scaffold's ghastly height ; 
To their rapt gaze a 
holier sight was given, 
Through the pale winter morning's fitful light 
There loomed the steps that led them up to Heaven 
No parting rite, no choral hymn uprose, 
No stately march, with solemn, sad refrain, 
The wind's low requiem lulled them to repose, 
The only mourner ' inid the funeral train. 
This is no time for tears—nxet summer's sun 
Will call forth many a 
blossom on the stein, 
The autumn's golden vintage will be won— 
Oil, may we reap the harvest sown by them ! 
Dark's the cloud our mountains o'er, 
A cloud that never cawe before; 
Stern the noon-hush—broken lowly 
By the voice of sorrow solely. 
Floats th..1 death- knell on the wind. 
Grief, alas ! comes close behind ; 
Harshly hoarse the raven's croat.ing 
Warning that man's life is broken. 
For thee, 0 
noble youth ! for thee, 
Wails the bean-sij e 
mournfullie. 
In I 
he midnight, still and lone, 
Sadly swells her caoine's moan. 
The Rock's Son answers to her wail, 
Grieving from gray wall and vale;

Morn, or cheers us late or early.
