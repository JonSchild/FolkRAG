SONGS AND RECITATIONS. 
Jack of All Trades. 
A 
gentleman once, I'd a 
train of my own, 
But my train is all docked, and I'm left all alone, 
And now, as I 
never had pride, though I'd pelf, 
I 
don't mind becoming a 
servant myself. 
At table I 
can wait, 
. 
Clean a 
knife, or change a 
plate, 
Quick as thought, when there's company or gay day; 
Mount a 
nag behind my lord, 
Whene'er he goes abroad, 
Or dangle at the heels of my lady: 
After wine-cellar look 
Fatten poultry, garden, cook. 
A 
monstrous variety of small trades! 
Make stews, clean shoes; 
Friz a 
wig, kill a 
pig; 
Brew, bake, broil a 
steak: 
Clean house, milk cows; 
Cheese turn, butter churn; 
Mend clothes, darn hose; 
Run of errands, 0, I 
warrant 
You'll find me complete Jack of all trades.

Militia Muster Folk. 
Am :--" Voulez vous dancer." 
Now Militia muster folk, 
Friends and neighbors, 
Glory's labors 
Call upon us, ' tis no joke, 
Then bring your guns and sabres; 
Or if arms you have not got 
Bring your pitchforks and what not— 
Umbrellas, 
My good fellows, 
Bean-stalks, fishing-rods, I 
wot. 
Spoken. — Ay, ay, my friends and neighbors, we must make no 
distinction of the personages now. 
The tradesman must be lost 
in the officer, the gentleman sunk in the soldier— so come, fall in, 
or we shall fall out—form a 
line there, form a 
line, if you please 
Why, bless me! do you call that a 
line ? 
Why, you're zigzag at 
both ends, and crooked in the middle. Now do, gentlemen, alter. 
Neighbor Gizzard, don't you see your inside is quite hollow, and 
that it wants filling up. 
Yes, and so would yours, if you'd come 
out without your breakfast, as I 
have. 
You should put a 
biscuit 
in your pocket, when you come to drill; but come, we must get 
on. 
Stand at ease ! Neighbor Cripplegait, why don't you stand 
at ease? I 
can't, Major; for these here last breeches you've 
made me are so tight, they screw me like a vice. 
Well, send 
'em back after exercise, and they shall be let out. 
Now then, 
eyes right, you there with the spectacles. I 
wish I 
could put my 
eyes right. Mr. officer; but all your tactics won't alter my optics, 
because you see I 
squints. 
Now, gentlemen, you with the guns, 
come forward. 
You with the umbrellas, wheel to the right. You 
with the bean-stalks and fishing-rods, turn to the left; and you 
with the pitch-forks and spits, go behind, and mintl yon don't 
stick them in any one's stibble end. 
Now shoulder— I 
didnt say 
arms. 
Well, but you might have said it, you know. 
Fall back, 
fall back, there. 
What the devil do you leave the ranks for, Pry ? 
Only come out, Captain, to ask if there had been any reduction 
on broad cloths, and what the news were? Pooh, nonsense! 
Farmer Waddel, what do you do out of the ranks? 'Why, I 
beez 
going at command of Colonel Forbes, to the back of that there 
hedge! 
Gentlemen, we shall never finish, if we begin in this 
manner—fall in, fall back. 
Now, Militia muster folk, 
Friends and neighbors, 
Glory's labors 
Call upon us, ' tis no joke— 
Then hey for guns and sabres. 
The manceuvring now begins, 
Dressing, form, 
Charming charming,

Militia Muster Polk.--CONTINUED. 
Now they exercise their pins, 
Marching, counter-marching. 
Now the corps is at fault, 
Now they wheel, and now they halt, 
Hours employing 
In deploying, 
Till their throats are parching. 
Spoken. — Halt! halt! halt !—why, gentlemen, you've left the 
rearguard behind. 
Yes, so we have, we're beforehand with them. 
Now, gentlemen, we're going to exercise, and in order that all 
may be correct, I'll give the word from my book of the New Sys-
tem. " Rules and regulations for regulating the rules that rules 
the regulars." 
Stand at ease ! Attention! Shoulder arms! Fix 
bayonets! 
Why, Captain, how are we to fix bayonets when out 
guns are on our shoulders? 
Oh ! I 
beg pardon, I've turned over 
two leAves at once. 
Order arms! 'Clam bayonets! -Why, we 
haven't fixed them yet, Captain. 
That's true, but never mind. 
Ground arms! why, bless me, brother Falter, you've tumbled 
down—I 
hope you haven't hurt yourself? Yes I've cut my nose, 
and bled a 
bushel, I 
guess. 
Yes, he's wounded in the service, 
and shed blood in the cause, I 
calculate. 
Yes, and there's one 
gentleman has run his bayonet into a 
very tender part of my frame, 
and I've only to inform this here corps that I 
am not bomb proof. 
What have you put up your umbrella for, Sandy ? 
Because I 
guess we shall have a 
pretty considerable damn'd heavy shower 
of rain soon, and though you may expect us to be able to stand 
fire, I 
believe there is no rule to oblige us to stand water. 
-Why, 
egad. that's true, and it is beginning to.rain, sure enough— for-
ward, umbrellas! shoulder umbrellas ! fall in three deep: take 
close order ! prenare umbrellas! now, then, fire umbrellas! that's 
right—they are all up— this is what you may consider covering 
the regiment with a 
masked battery—there, it's all over now, so 
we'll go on again. 
Yes, Militia muster folk, 
Friends and neighbors, 
Glory's labors 
Call upon us, ' tis no joke— 
Then hey for guns and sabres. 
Every heart with ardor bnrns, 
Pants for glory, 
Lives in story, 
Each all thought of yielding spurns, 
Like a 
true-born Yankee. 
Now Columbia's valiant sons 
Prove that they are sons of guns, 
Fire and thunder, 
Spreading wonder, 
But no harm done, I 
thank ye.

Militia Muster Folk.—CONCLUDED. 
Spoken.-- Gentlemen, to avoid accidents, and perform our evo-
lutions with military precision, you in the front row must kneel, 
and you in the second row must stand up ; this is what we call 
platonic firing ; —but mind, the gentlemen in the second row are 
not allowed to shoot the gentlemen's heads off in the front row; 
and if any gentlemen in the front row should fall down, the per-
sons behind them shall pick them up again. 
Now, return ram-
rods—Eh ! bless me, Master Clayskull, what are you doing? Why, 
I'm returning my ramrod to neighbor Longstaff; I 
borrowed it 
of him the last time we went out shooting together, and now I'm 
giving it to him back again ; if that ain't returning ramrods, you 
may do the exercise yourself another time. 
Gentlemen, if any 
of you should bite your cartridge at the wrong end, just be good 
enough to spit the ball out again. 
Make ready. 
Who's that 
firing before the time ? for shame, friend! Quick, present— really, 
gentlemen, this is a 
waste of powder; I 
never heard anything so 
bad as—there, again—now! gentlemen, fire! 
Realty. I 
never 
heard such irregular firing in a 
regular regiment. 
Fishing- rods, 
I 
never heard your report. 
Eli! why, gentlemen, what are you 
all dancing about in that manlier for ?—stand at ease ! —attention! 
damn the muskitoes—shoulder arms !—march. 
Bravo, Militia muster folk, 
Friends and neighbors, 
Glory's labors, 
Call upon us, ' tis no joke— 
Then hey for guns and sabres.

A.—Here comes B., the liveliest, yet most tiresome of word-
catchers. 
I 
wonder whether he'll have wit enough to hear good 
news of his mistress. " Well, B., my near boy, I 
hope I 
see 
you well." 
B.—'' I 
hope you do, my dear A., otherwise you have lost your 
eyesight." 
A.—•• Good. 
Well, bow do you do ?" 
B.---" How? Why, as other people do. 
You would not have 
me eccentric, would you ?" 
A.—' • Nonsense, I 
mean how do you find yourself ?" 
B.—" Find myself? Where's the necessity of finding myself? 
I 
have not been lost." 
A •

B —(('ome8 elosto• to A. and looks .serious.)

A.—" Ah, ha! you make me laugh in spite of myself. 
How

B.—" The deuce! how is Jackson ? Well, I 
should never have

A.—" Good bye."

aloud on the integrity of a

A.—" Ludicrous enough. I 
can't help laughing, I 
confess. 
But laughing does not always imply merriment. You do not de-
light us, Jack, with these sort of jokes, but tickle us, and tick-
ling may give pain." 
B.—` • Don't accept it, then.

Teddy O'Brian's Adventures. 
A IR 
Be a Good Boy." 
When I 
was at home, in old Ireland, so frisky, 
From morning to night, faith, I 
swigged at the whisky; 
I 
oft got blind drunk, sure, and that is the way 
To see all things double, I've heard people say. 
One day, in this state, sure, I 
went to my Shelah, 
And with my shellelagh I 
rang such a 
peal, ah! 
Arrah, Teddy, says she, you're a 
comical bore, 
But don't you be after, now, breaking the door. 
12 
Teddy O'Brian's Adventures.—CONTINUED. 
Spoken. — Och, sure! now, says she, Teddy O'Brian, and will 
you be after being aisy, now, till I 
open the door ?— Och, bad 
luck to you, says I, if you're going to be after keeping me out-
side all night : just let me be after coming in, and set down till 
you open the door ; so, after a 
little blarney, I 
got her to let me 
in ; so I 
bolted into the parlor, and when I 
sat down I 
stood up 
and said—Och. my dear, darling Shelah, says I, if I 
haven't been 
drinking your health in a 
noggin of the cratur, and success to 
your beautiful eyes, (for, you must know, my Shelah had two 
elegant eyes, only the misfortune was, she could never see out of 
one of them at all, at all, faith, and she couldn't see out of the 
other either when she swigged at the cratur!) but Shelah, said I, 
who was that talking to you when I 
thumped at the door? 
Oh, 
may whisky be my poison, says she, if it was anybody at all, at 
all, 
Och, Shelah, says I, don't be after cramming me ; so with 
that I 
got up, and looked in the other room, and there was Loo-
ney Mactwolter ;
so I 
began to lay my shellelagh about him, sure, 
and he slipped about like a 
live eel after it's dead ; and he just 
stood long enough to take to his heels. 
Och, says Shelah, and 
what are you beating the man for ? 
Sure, says I, I 
am only do 
ing what you was—amusing myself with nobody at all, at all ; 
but good night, Shelah! 
Och, and won't you be after staying 
with me, my darling? says she. 
Oh, no, if you catch me here 
again, I'll give you leave to spoil my singing— 
Too ral lal loo, &c. 
So I 
clapped all my property top of my back, 
And off, sure, to New York I 
set in a 
crack, 
Where I 
met an old friend, Mr. Dermot O'Shee, 
Who never before was acquainted with me. 
Och! says he,—what d'ye come for, my nate little honey? 
Says I,— nothing at all, my dear soul, but the money ! 
Arrah, Teddy, says he, you're a 
comical gill,— 
But won't you be after now taking a 
swill ? 
Spoken.—Och, come along, my dear fellow, and we will be after 
mugging ourselves over a 
noggin. 
But, Teddy, and what is it 
you're after maning to do ? 
Och, sure, says I. and don't I 
mane 
to be after mending the roads ? 
Och, the devil burn me, says 
he, but they've got a 
new way of making roads by breaking them 
to pieces. 
Now you don't be humming me, said I. 
Och, by ray 
soul, said he, but it's true; and they have found out the way how 
to break the heart of a 
stone ! Sure, and that isn't the worst of 
it either, for. bad luck to them, but they're making cast-iron 
stones; and they're going to be after boring New York now with 
a 
tunnel. 
Och, said I. I 
thought it was too full of hollowness and 
deceit already; and the tunnel must only be an opening for more. 
Why, so it is, says he, and while they keep on making them so 
fast, we may never expect to be brought to a 
close

week; and 
live all the time on bread and water; and then, sure, you may 
be after showing yourself for n

won't the people be after seeing into me ? Och, never mind that, 
Teddy. 
Well, but Dermot, what shall I

You 
must call yourself Boneall; say you come from Corsica; apolo-
gize for the bareness of the subject, and tell them you are not a

them know a

Independence. 
TEXT.—Independence is the thing, 
And we're the boys to boast On't. 
Mx HEARERS :—Next Thursday is the birthday of American 
Liberty— the day upon which our Star-Spangled Banner first 
waved in the fair breeze of Freedom— the day that the proud 
eagle of the mountain first looked down from his eyry on a 
free 
and independent nation—the day upon which the fat, ragged, 
and saucy children of Columbia broke loose from the apron- strings 
of their mother- country and kicked up their heels for joy, like so 
many colts released from the bondage of winter confinement. 
You ought on this occasion, to be as full of glory as a 
gin- bottle, 
that this blessed aniversary is about once more to dawn upon 
your heads, and find you reaping the harvest of those blessings 
-which your fathers sowed in revolutionary soil, watered with their 
own blood, and manured with their own ashes. 
Yes, you ought 
to throw up your caps, and make the halls of Freedom ring with 
loud huzzas, and then sit down and meditate on the groans, and 
the pains of travail,which attended this mighty Republic during 
the delivery of her first- born— LIBERTY. 
My 
friends, next Thursday the celebration will take place. Then 
the whOle nation will be alive like a 
beggar's shirt ; there will be 
a 
general stirring up of the genus homo from one end of the na-
tion to another. 
The fires of enthusiasm will be kindled in every 
breast ; and many of those who lack in patriotic glory, will, 
doubtless, supply themselves with tile article at the 
booth's round 
the Park. 
But, my dear friends, this sixpenny Otriotism is most horrible 
stuff; it is patriotism of the head, and not of the heart. It makes 
you feel too independent altogether. 
It induces you to light in 
Si 
14 
Independence.—CONCLUDED. 
times of peace, and takes all the starch out of your courage in 
times of war. 
While this artificial patriotism is effervescing in 
your cocoa-nuts, your boasts of independence are loud and clam-
orons ; but when its spirit has evaporated, you are the veriest 
serviles that ever writhed under the lash of despotism. 
If you 
suppose, my friends, that the proper way to observe our national 
independence is by drinking brandy slings and gin cock-tails, you 
are just as mistaken as the boy was who set a 
bear- trap to catch 
bed- bugs. 
My dear hearers: I 
like to hear you boast of your independ-
ence, if it be not done in a 
vain and bragadocial spirit, and my 
giatuitous prayer is, that you may maintain it as long as you are 
permitted to squat this side of' the deep, still river of death. To 
preserve your collective strength, your hearts, your feelings, and 
your pure sympathies must be all joined together, like the links 
of a 
log-chain. 
You must all hang together, like a 
string of fish, 
and stick to one another through thick and thin, like a 
bunch of 
burdocks in a 
bell-wether's fleece. 
Remember, my friends, that 
with all your boasted independence, you are poor, weak, miser-
able, dependent beings. 
That same Almighty hand which pro-
vides you with soup and shirts, beef and breeches, can take them 
all from you in a 
little less than a 
short space of- time, and leave 
you as naked as an apple-tree in winter. 
Yes, my friends, you 
must recollect that you are dependent, as well as independent; 
and that all the favors you receive are donations from heaven. 
brought down by . angels of mercy, and distributed impartially 
among the grabbing, snatching, and thieving sons of sin.

Young Bodkin and Molly Jenkins. 
Young Bodkin was a 
tailor bold, 
And his love he did unfold 
To cruel Molly Jenkins; 
He soon began to curse his lot, 
For blacksmith Bob her heart had got, 
Who struck the iron, while ' twas /wt, 
And married Molly Jenkins. 
To the river Bodkin ran, 
And drowned the ninth part of a 
man, 
For love of Molly Jenkins; 
When she heard it she did sigh, 
Poor soul! he's wet and I 
am dry, 
So I 
think I'd best-wet t'other eye— 
Cruel Molly Jenkins. 
Bodkin's ghost, as it appears, 
Came one night all with his shears, 
" 
0 
hid!" cried Molly Jenkins, _ 
" 
The doors are locked; what's your design? 
How you got in I 
can't divine ;" 
Said he, " My ghost is superfine, 
Cruel Molly Jenkins." 
• 
Said she, " Since you your shears have got, 
'Tis plain you mean that we must cut," 
Said he, " No, Molly Jenkins; 
Along with me you must decamp, 
Unto my grave, so cold and damp ;" 
She gave a 
squall—it was the cramp 
Which wakened Molly Jenkins. 
M ORAL. — Ye tailors, mark what I 
relate, 
Take pattern from poor Bodkin's fate, 
Who died for Molly Jenkins; 
And, ladies, when sly Cupid reigns, 
Lest trouble should reward your pains, 
Don't, like a 
blacksmith, forge the chains, 
But think on Molly Jenkins.

IS 
King Dick. 
I 
sing of a 
warrior bold, 
Who was fond of both murder and strife, sir; 
On his back he'd a 
hump, I've been told, 
And his shins were as sharp as a 
knife, sir; 
His days he passed over in shame, 
(Believe me ' tis true every word, sir;) 
He gained much tyrannical fame, 
And his name it was Dicky the Third, sir. 
Rum ti iddity, &c. 
This comical outlandish dog, 
With ambition grew very big, sir; 
He grunted and growled like a 
hog, 
And stuck Harry Just like a 
pig, sir; 
"Down, down to hell, rascal," he cried. 
"'Tis a 
proper place for thee to enter; 
Go, tell brother Nick how you died, 
And tell him also that I 
sent you. 
Rum ti iddity, &c. 
Now Dick bit his fingers and nails, 
And with passion got near out of breath, sir; 
To think what a 
number of tales 
He m st tell to account for his death, sir; 
" 
I 
have it," he cried, " people may 
Inquire with wonder how fell he, 
But sure it is easy to say 
He died with the cramp in his belly." 
Rum ti iddity, 
Then soon were the people appeased, 
Which made him more thirsty for glory; 
He felt himself very well pleased, 
To hear they had swallowed his story; 
But still he'd not finisheol his plan, 
Oh! no, for a 
very good reason; 
He had to destroy Lady Anne, 
For fear he should get hanged for treason. 
Rum ti iddity, Sze. 
Now Dicky to finish his work, 
Had many more schemes to contrive, sir; 
Ile grinned and he swore like a 
Turk, 
For still were two princes alive, sir; 
" 
By jingo!" he cried, with a 
frown, 
"I have those young dogs in my power; 
And to make me more sure of my crown, 
I'll invite them to sleep in the tower." 
Rum ti iddity, &e. 
King Dick.—CONCLUDED. 
To their nunky they soon were bath led, 
But against the whole plan were their hearts bent; 
They didn't much fancy the bed, 
Nor did they much like the apartment; 
They stirred up a 
deuce of a 
row, 
But to end any more altercation, 
Consented, by making their bow, 
Just to please their good hump-back relation. 
Rum ti iddity, &c. 
Then down they both laid to repose, 
And never did mortals sleep sounder; 
Two men stopt their mouths with the clothes, 
And killed them both dead as a 
flounder; 
Then Dick softly crept to the door, 
Cried, " tell me if we are alone, sir ;" 
"'Tis dorie," cries a 
son of a 
gun, 
" 
So you'd better make haste to your throne, sir." 
Rum ti iddity, &c. 
Now soon did the sad news take flight, 
'Bout the death of these two murdered princes; 
The people saw all was not -right, 
And their faces looked sour as quinces; 
One Richmond, in angry talk, 
'Gainst poor Dicky did loudly complain, sir; 
Swore he'd cut up his carcase like pork, 
And shorten the days of his reign, sir. 
Rum ti iddity, 
c. 
Then soon in a 
field they both met, 
Poor Dicky was pricked by remorse, sir; 
He bawled out aloud ' till he sweat, 
" 
My kingdom I'll give for a 
horse," sir! 
" 
Your kingdom," cried Richmond, " good lack, 
'Tis mine, or the devil is in it ;" 
Then whipt out his guts in a 
crack, 
And sent him to hell in a 
minute. 
Rum ti iddity, Scc. 
Then home trudged good Richmond, so gay, 
Was cheered as he passed through the town, sir; 
And, indeed I 
have heard some folks say, 
.He got for his trouble a 
crown, sir; 
So thus ends my wonderful tale,

And as long as you live never riii1

FELLOW-REPUBLICANS AND FELLOW-SUFFERERS : 
am a 
plain 
and modest man, born at an early period of my existence. 
I 
have struggled from the obscurity, to which an unlucky star had 
doomed me, till I 
have risen like a 
bright exaltation in the even-
ing to the summit of human greatness and grandeur. 
Gentle-
men, I 
profess no principles—unfortunately I 
have none. 
On 
the unhappy occasion of my birth, a 
dismal and melancholy man, 
clothed in the somber hues of mourning, swapped me for anoth-
er baby, and subsequently lost me at a 
raffle. 
Sad event. 
But 
who can control his fate? 
We are the creatures of destiny— 
" 
there is a 
divinity that shapes our ends, rough hew them how 
we will." 
I 
was intended by nature for a 
great statesman. 
Had 
I 
lived in the days of Hannibal, I 
should have beaten that great 
chieftain in crossing the Alps; and it is a 
dead certain thing. that 
I 
could have distanced Cortez in crossing the Isthmus. He never 
performed the feats I 
have did; he never came up the Chagres 
River in a 
canoe, with a 
deaf and dumb " hombre," without a 
red cent, or change of summer apparel. " But a 
light heart and 
a 
thin pair of breeches goes merrily through the world." 
Sir, every man who has come here is a 
Columbus! 
He comes 
here to discover new diggins. 
I 
am a 
Columbus. 
I 
was dead 
broke at home, as Columbus was, and I 
have come here to strike 
a 
new vein. 
But I 
am not going to the mines! 
Oh. no. 
You 
don't catch me up to my waist in ice-water with. a 
juvenile pick-
axe and an incipient crow-bar, laboring under a 
sun of one hun-
dred degrees in the shade, to dig out filthy lucre. 
No, sir! Jam 
not on that lay. 
I 
hate labor—it was an invention to vex man-
kind. 
I 
prefer an office, one that is lucrative and not laborious; 
what you call a 
sinecure. 
And if I 
cannot get one myself, I 
will 
go in for any man who will divide on the dead level and no splits. 
Sir, where will you find a 
glorious country like this ? 
Talk not 
of the oriental gorgeousness of eastern countries. 
Tell us not 
of the fury scenes which poets, who revel in the great warm bath 
of heavenly imaginations, paint with golden pens on leaves of 
satin. 
The description of this beautiful country should be writ-
ten with the golden wand of an angel dipped in the softest rays 
of a 'sunbeam, upon the blushing and delicate surface of a 
rose 
leaf. 
Excuse me, gentlemen, I 
except only the rainy season and 
the time when the dust flies. 
We love our native land, we honor 
her flag,—and would rob the custom-house, if we had a 
fair show. 
Bat Congress must not put on airs, or we will take charge of the 
custom-house and post-office, and make a 
muss generally. Them 
is my sentiments, gentlemen. 
The Sewing Machine. 
" 
Got ono ? 
Don't sax so! Which did you get ? 
One of the hind to open and shut ? 
Own it, or hire it ? 
How much did you pay ?

Does it go with a

I'm a 
single man, and somewhat green, 
Tell me about your sewing machine." 
Listen, my boy, and hear all about it— 
I 
don't know what I 
could do without it; 
I've ownd one now for more than a 
year, 
And like it so well, I 
call it " my dear ;" 
Ms the cleverest thing that ever was seen, 
This wonderful family sewing machine. 
It's none of your angular Wheeler things, 
With steel-shod beak and cast-iron wings; 
Its work would bother a 
hundred of his, 
And worth a 
thousand! 
Indeed it is; 
And has a 
way—you needn't stare— 
Of combing and braiding its own back hair! 
Mine is not one of those stupid affairs 
That stands in a 
corner, with what-riots and chairs, 
And makes that dismal, head achy noise, 
Which all the comfort of sewing destroys; 
No rigid contrivance of lumber or steel, 
But one with a 
natural spring in the heel. 
Mine is one of the kind to love, 
And wear a 
shawl and a 
soft kid glove; 
Has the merriest eyes, and dainty foot, 
And sports the charming gaiter boot, 
And a 
bonnet with feathers, and ribbons, and loops, 
With any indefinite number of hoops. 
None of your patent machines for me, 
Unless dame Nature is the patentee; 
I 
like the sort that can laugh and talk, 
And take my arm for an evening walk; 
That will do whatever the owner may choose, 
With the slightest perceptible turn of the :,ertws! 
One that can dance, and—possibly— flirt; 
And make a 
pudding, as well as a 
shirt— 
One that can sing without dropping a 
stitch, 
And play the house-wife, lady, or witch— 
Ready to give the sagest advice, 
Or do up your collars or things so nice. 
What do you think of my machine ? 
Ain't it the best that ever was seen? 
'Tisn't a 
clumsy, mechanical toy, 
But flesh and blood! 
Hear that, my boy? 
With a 
turn for gossip, and household affairs, 
Which include, you know, the sewing of tears.

Tut, tut—don't talk. 
I

You needn't keep winking so hard at the wall;

sewing machine! 
Well, get one, then— of the same design— 
There were plenty left when I

The Ups and Downs. 
A 
chap once told St. Patrick's dean, 
While rising from his seat, " I 
mean 
To set up for a 
wit." 
" 
Ah 
quoth the dean, " if that be true, 
Tlie very best thing you can do 
Is down again to sit." 
Too many, like that would-be wit, 
Set up for what they are not fit 
And always lose their aim; 
Set up for wisdom, wealth, renown, 
But end the farce by sitting down, 
With poverty and shame. 
A 
middling farmer thinks he can 
Set up to be a 
gentleman, 
And then sit down content ; 
But after many a 
turn and twist, 
Is set down on a 
pauper list, 
A 
fool, not worth a 
cent. 
When farmers' wives and daughters fair 
Set up with silks and Bonnets rare, 
To look most wondrous winning; 
They sit upon a 
slippery stand, 
Till indigence, with iron hand 
Upsets their underpining. 
Some city ladies, too, whose gear 
Has made them to their husbands char, 
Set up to lead the ton,; 
Though they sit high on fashion's seat, 
Age, death, or poverty, albeit 
Will set them down anon. 
Some fools set up to live by law 
And though they are " all over jaw," 
Soon fall for lack of brains; 
But had the boobies only just 
Known where they ought to sit at first, 
They'd saved a 
world of pains.

The man might moil from morn to night 
And find his match with all his might 
To bury half he kills. 
You may set up for what you choose, 
As easily as wear old shoes, 
If e'er so low at present; 
But when you have set up in vain, 
And find you must sit down again, 
'Tis terribly unpleasant. 
The Weather. 
It's far in June—i'ts late in June— 
The month of leaves and roses— 
And pleasant light should meet the eyes, 
And pleasant smells the noses; 
They say that time is on the wing, 
And on the autumn gaining, 
But who would know it when it is 
Perpetually raining. 
I 
got my summer pantaloons 
A month ago o' Monday, 
And I 
have never had a 
chance 
To sport ern even one day; 
It's time for all the pleasant things, 
For walking, riding, training, 
But there is nothing in this world, 
But raining, raining, raining  
There's Jane has stay'd at home until 
She's white as an albino; 
And simpie Sue is in a 
fret  
To wear her Navarino; 
" 
The wash" is soaking in the tub, 
The cambric muslins staining, 
And human nature's in the dumps 
With raining, raining, raining. 
The weather- cock has rusted East, 
The bine sky is forgotten; 
The earth's a 
saturated sponge, 
And vegetation's rotten; 
I 
hate to see the " darkest side," 
I 
hate to be complaining; 
But hang me if my temper stands 
This raining, raining, raining.

The Heated Term. 
The sun is very hot to- day. 
And every one we meet, 
Makes exclamations tending to 
intensify the heat. 
One's not inclined to take a 
spree 
And roam the streets about; 
'Tis foolish taking " hot within," 
When ' tis so " hot without." 
There's neighbor Jones the other day, 
Was struck down in a 
trice, 
And had to keep his body cool, 
By packing it in ice. 
And neighbor Smith fell in a 
fit, 
While walking on the street; 
Some say ' twas caused by what he eat, 
But we say ' twas the heat. 
'Tis death to stay within the house, 
And death to go outside— 
He who escapes the heated term, 
Should straight be deified. 
'Tis folly to attempt to sleep— 
To make a 
faint, and snore, 
'Tis best to seek a 
shady spot, 
On some soft cellar-door. 
" 
Keep cool!" exclaims a 
smother'd friend; 
But surely ' tis a 
joke, 
For how, we ask, can one keep cool, 
When ice is seen to smoke ? 
The very air we breathe is hot, 
And as it comes and goes, 
Our bodies seem like ovens in 
A 
lot of smoking clothes. 
We've read of icebergs and the like, 
Within the frozen pole— 
We've half inclined to emigrate, 
To keep our body whole. 
We cannot read—we cannot write— 
We're wedged as in a 
vice; 
We'll have to cease this iceless verse 
Till Blair sends down some ice.

A Short Sermon for the Hard-Shell Baptist.

" 
There's nine men a-standin' at the door, and they all said they'd take 
sugar in them." 
Sich, friends and brethren, was the talk, in a 
worldly cents, 
wuns common in this our ainshunt land; but the dais is gone 
by, and the sun runs dry, and no man can say to his nabor, boo 
art thou, man, and will you take eny more shoogar in your kangh-
PhY ? 
But the words of our text has a 
diffrunt and a 
more pertickler 
meaning than this. 
Thar tha stood at the doar on a 
cold winter's 
mornin, 
o 
Baptists, two Methodists, two Presbyterians, and 
three Lutherans, and the tother one was a 
publican. 
And tha all 
with one vois said thay'd not dirty ther feet in a 
dram shop, but 
if the publican wood go and get the drinks thay'd pay for 'em. 
An' tha all elide out an' evry man sed, " I'll take mine with shugar, 
for it won't feel good to drink the stuff without sweetnin." 
So 
the publikin he marched in, and the bar-keeper sed: " What 
want ye ?" 
And he ancerd and sed, " A 
drink!" " How will yo 
have it ?" 
Plane and strate," sez he, " for it's no use wastin shu-
gar to circumsalivate akhfortis. 
But there's nine more a-standin 
at the door, and tha all sed thay'd take shugar in them." 
Friends and brethren, it ain't only likker and sperrits that is 
drunk in this runderbout and underhand way, but it is the nicer 
of all eorts of human wickenis, in like manur. 
Thar's the liner 
of malls, that many of you drink to the dregs, but yure shure to 
sweeten it with the shugar of self-justification. Thar's the likker 
of averis, that some of you keeps behind the curtain for constant 
use, but you always has it well mixt with the sweetnin of prudens 
and econimy. 
Thar's the likker of self-luv that sum men drinks 
by the gallon, tha all puts into it lots of the shugar of take keer 
of No. 1. 
And thar's the likker of extorshrm, which the man 
sweetens accordin to circumstances. 
If he's in the flour line, 
he'll say the poor'll be better off eatin kom bred; if he's in the 
clothes line, he'll say it's a 
good thing to make ' era lam to make 
clothes to home; if he's in the lether line, it'll lam 'em the need-
cessity of takin better keer of ther shoos. " And thar's nine 
more a-standin at the dore, and tha all sed thay'd take shugar in 
them." 
But, friends and brethren, thar's a 
time cummin, and a 
place 
fixin, whar thar'll be no " stamlin at the dore," to call for " shugar 
in them," but thay'll have to go rite in and take the drink squar 
up to the frunt; and the bar-keeper'll be oil Satan, and nobody 
else; and he'll give em " shugar in them," you better believe 
it, and it'll be shugar of led, and red hot led at that, as shure as 
your name's Conshuns Dodger. 
And you will be entitled to 
your rashuns three times a

you don t 
like it you 11 have to lump it, and so may the Old Nick 
close down on all your silk perlaverin around all the plane old 
pools of brutherly luv and ginirosity and feller-feelin and fair

Special Pleadings in the Court of Requests. 
27 
A 
dispute having arisen between Jerry Snip, a 
respectable tail-
or, and Galen Glauber, an eminent apothecary, respecting a 
pair 
of small- clothes, with which Mr. Snip had furnished him, the 
tailor was under the necessity of calling upon the doctor to meet 
him at the court of requests, where the following trial of profes-
sional skill took place, to the great entertainment of the whole 
court. 
Mr. Snip having thrice hemmed, to clear his pipe, thus 
addressed the bench— 
" 
An't please your worship, I 
beg leave to tender my suit; trust-
ing I 
shall receive such measure of redress as is fitting. 
I 
am in 
sheer distress, and live upon remnants rnd such like, and besides 
am sorely afflicted with the tape-worm, else I 
would laugh in my 
sleeve, and care not a 
button for my enemy. 
As it is, I 
must stick 
in his skirts till he pays; for 1 
can't afford to be out of pocket. 
My 
inside muSt be lined with a 
thimble- full of good stuff, or I 
must 
die! 
But though I 
am poor, I 
am a 
pattern of morality, and 
would rather go to hell and feed on cabbage than say a 
pin's point 
from the truth before one seated on the shop-board of justice. Now, 
your worship must know, this 'poticary Galen Glauber, who has 
not a 
skein of honesty in his make, ordered a 
pair of jalap-colored 
breeches, or as ladies delicately call them, inexpressibles. 
When 
I 
took them home, no fault was found; but when I 
presented my 
bill, my 
ge111111a12, began to hem, and getting into a 
huge pucker, 
said 1 
might as well have put him into a 
straight waistcoat, that 
the band was too high, and had given him a 
twist in the bowels, 
a 
stitch in the side, and such sort of nonsense. 
This raised my 
choler, and we were very near coming to cuffs. 
My fingers did 
itch to trim him, and to sew his eyes up ; I'd made him as stiff as 
buckram. 
For I'll lay any man a 
goose to a 
remnant there never 
was a 
better cut article in the trade. 
So I 
hope your worship 
will not allow Galen Glauber to leave the yard before he opens 
the plaits of his purse and gathers for me the amount of my bill." 
Mr. Snip having concluded, the doctor thus replied, " Now that 
this precipitate maniac has made his crude indigested motion replete 
with gall, let me submit a 
statement of the case. 
I 
trust I 
shall 
purge from your worship's mind all ideas of my having followed 
a 
wrong course, and that I 
shall so turn the scales to gripe my 
opponent smartly. 
Nothing acid shall issue from my lip. I

rather heal than ulcerate; I 
would rather discuss than foment this 
tumor of disputation. 
It shall be my endeavor to remove those 
symptoms of inflammation which must obstruct the cure of the 
evil before us. 
Yet I 
am by no means lethargic or plegmatic; not 
so; I 
only avoid venomous applications, such as must irritate the 
subject. 
But to proceed—this quack of a 
prick- louse was called in 
to make me a 
pair of small clothes, for which, after due consulta-
tion, he had my recipe. 
But having perhaps taken a 
drachm too 
much, or being void of all scruples of conscience, he neglected to 
form them secundem artem, as I 
had prescribed. 
He made the 
waistband too small, which oparating as a 
ligature, pressed so 
severely on the abdomen as to produce a 
constirpation of the rec-
tum, and agitating the intestines, so accelerated the pe,r18talic Mo-
tion as to cause a 
rapid expulsion of the faeces, such as alluded the 
retentive powers of the spincter ani! 'Ms 
operation so flooded 
the small clothes in question, as to render them not only an eye-
sore, but too faetid for further use, as your worship's olfactory 
nerves no doubt can testify. 
The revulsion I 
have described was 
evidently induced by the pressure of the belly band, which being 
so tense as to render ineffectual all attempts to unbutton, compelled I 
me to the necessity of making an incision so as to divide the noxious 
parts. 
All this I 
pointed out in a 
lecture to this phrenzied, man, 
who, in lieu of being patient, and duly weighing causes with effects 
became red as dragon's:blood, and, assuming a 
daring tone, adher_ 
ing like diachylon to his unjust demands. I 
remained cool, else 
had I 
been of an irritable habit, I 
should have made my stick cling 
round him like quill bark, or perhaps have phlebotomized him at 
the nose! 
However, I 
will amputate all excrescences from the 
matter, and having described the rise, progress, and symrtoms of 
the distemper, will cheerfully confide in your worship's justice to 
deliver me from this lunatic's obstruction to the functions of my 
professions." 
'rite court having heard both parties, decided that, as the tail_ 
or had not abided by the orders given, he must submit to a 
non-
suit.

King Harry and His Six Wives. 
'Tis a 
comical ditty I 
sing, 
The blue devils hoping to parry; 
My subject, I 
swear, is a 
King, 
And he is the eighth English Harry : 
His temper waa terrible hot, 
As honest historians tell ye; 
And he tempered his clay with a 
pot, 
Which accounts for his royal pot-belly! 
Soon he married ( to dry up her tears) 
The widow of Arthur, his brother : 
They cuddled and kicked eighteen years, 
When he had his eye on another. 
_Nanny Roleyne, beyond all dispute, 
Her lips were like cherries pretty. 
And he, longing long for such fruit, 
Begged the Pope to divorce his queen Kitty. 
3.1ister Pope would not do that, that's flat, 
And a 
great flat he was too, I 
fancy; 
For Hal married, and turned out queen Kate, 
And turned into her place lady Nancy; 
Then the Pope he shook off, who, numskull, 
Sent a 
bull, to make bold Harry bow, sir, 
But what for his bull cared John Bull, 
Whom no bull nor bully could cow, sir. 
Well, his majesty loved his new dear 
As any old miser his guinea; 
But jealous he was and severe, 
And Nancy would oft play the ninny. 
He, at last, caught her playing, ' tis said, 
At kiss-in-the-ring, with some soldiers; 
So he first took the crown from her head, 
And then took her head from her shoulders. 
Then a 
third and fourth wife had their day, 
And a 
fifth tied the knot with this madman ; 
But she wanted to have her own way, 
And, when bridled, she called him a 
bad man ; 
Her bad words gave the king a 
bad shock, 
And he mourned that good wives were uncommon, 
When he once again thought of the block, 
Where they chopped her—into a 
good woman. 
Yes, a 
sixth did this gray Blueheard get., 
With a 
tongue in length full three miles German; 
And she preached him a 
long sermonet, 
That had near been her funeral sermon; 
For he ordered her off to a 
jail, 
Next to grace Tower-hill was her dread, sir; 
But, however to save t 
long tale, 
The king died, and this queen saved her head, sir.

have you not heard of a 
story, 
A 
comical story, and true ? 
If you haven't, and will but attend, 
It's a 
hundred to one, but you do. 
It is of a 
man of some note. 
A 
comical outlandish fellow; 
In Venice lived as it's wrote, 
And his name was -Mister Othello! 
CHORUS. 
Rumpti udity, udity rumpty, udity, ido. 
Runayti, udity, udity, ri fal la de la lido. 
A 
gentleman there had a 
daughter, 
With Othy she'd grown very mellow ; 
He wondered what passion had caught her, 
She sighed for her blacky, Othello! 
Now, Brabant° had offered his daughter 
A 
husband a 
long time before; 
She sneezed at the one he had brought her, 
She vow'd and declared she'd have .

Rumpti udity, &e. 
Then General Othello he came, 
And to Gretna the lady he carried; 
Gretna mayn't be indeed the right name, 
But no matter— I'm sure they were married. 
No sooner they tightly were tied, 
Than jealousy seizes love's place: 
And Othello was so mad with his bride, 
That, egad! he looked black in the face. 
Rumpti udity, &c. 
A 
young Captain Cassio, by luck, 
She saw—a 
fine, dashing gay fellow, 
His sabre and gorget they stuck 
In the gizzard of Mr. Othello. 
After drill, now, this volunteer gay 
Oft with Mrs. Othello drank coffee, sir, 
Till Othy thought proper to say, 
"Sweet Desdy, don't ask that young officer."

Othello. —[CONCLUDED.

One evening, this captain so smart, 
Called in winter, as truly ' tis said ; 
And though he was hot in his heart, 
Yet he'd got a 
bad cold in his head. 
Now, as Mr. Othello was out, 
And for favors his wife couldn't thank her chief, 
To wipe Cassio's aquilline snout, 
Desdemona lent her pocket-handkerchief. 
Rumpti udity, &c. 
A 
young ancient, Iago, love felt, 
And sweet Desdy he wished to be kissing; 
But, finding the fair wouldn't melt, 
Turned to mischief her handkerchief missing; 
And bent upon making a 
row, 
Treated Othy with beer, at an oyster-house; 
Invented the when, and the how,— 
Then Othello turned wonderful boisterous. 
Rumpti udity, &c. 
So, when he comes home, straight he goes 
To Mrs. Othello in bed— 
And says he, " Dear, I 
must blow my nose, 
For I've got a 
sad cold in my head. 
A 
handkerchief, wife, I 
expect one," 
So out from the pillow she tost it; 
"Not this," he exclaimed, but the checked one," 
" 
Oh! curse it," cries Desdy, " I've lost it." 
Rumpti u1ity, &c. 
" 
You lie," says Othello, " that's true, 
So nothing remains to be said." 
" 
I 
lie !—yes my dear, that I ; 
For, by jingo, I 
lie in the bed." 
Cries Othello, " I 
vow there's too much light— 
I'll never be called a 
blood spiller ;" 
So the general he put out the rushlight, 
And killed hia wife dead with the pillow. 
Rumpti udity, & c. 
Then the blood of Iago he shed, 
Then he fell on his dear Desdy's body; 
Then Mrs. Othello's dead head 
On her shoulders went nidity noddy. 
All this comes from a 
cold in the head, 
So blind Fortune, in this matter, shows her eye ; 
Not one of these folks would have been dead, 
If they had but worn fine fleecy hosiery.

As soon as she's heated my gruel.

But 'ere you have ta'en off your clothes, 
Be sure that you put out that candle.

This must be some blade of the brain, 
Those witches are given to hoax.

Just as much as to say diddle, diddle,

Dead walls are much given to talking.

For he'd ne'er stick at anything yet.

To call thee to heaven or hell.

Messrs. A, B, C, being characters known, 
To children quite small, and to those larger grown, 
Invited the alphabet once, great and small, 
To supper and cards, and a 
bit of a 
ball :— 
A 
undertook the amusements in st ore, 
B 
baked the buns, the while C 
chalk'd the floor; 
C 
sent round the circulars, all postage free, 
To come to the party of great A, B, C. 
The first note they wrote, and had sent, was to D, 
But D was a 
dunce and forgot A, B, C; 
Unless he tried to decipher the letter. 
So took it to E, as E 
could read better; 
E 
told him all E desired to know, 
And F, coming in, felt inclined, too, to go; 
So D, E, and F, in one coach got all three, 
To join the party of great A, B, C.

In mirth and good humor they all joined with glee, 
To join the grand party of great A, B, C.

Billy Goose and the Devil. 
Billy Goose was a 
tailor, and, ah, woful tale! 
With an unmarried lady lived he ; 
She tormented him sorely, no words could prevail, 
She was Ion ler than he, and she fought tooth and nail, 
Till at last lie resolved to be free. 
With a 
horrible oath he was thus heard to say 
As he kicked her at last from the door; 
" 
May the devil himself come and fetch me away, 
With tape, buckram, and sheers, if you longer shall stay, 
Or if ever I 
take you back more !" 
But women can wheedle us all, as we know, 
And coax and persuade us to evil; 
She prayed and she promised, as women know how, 
Poor Billy was very soon false to his vow, 
Quite forgetting his oath and the devil. 
And now all their friends were invited to sup, 
Beef and cabbage were placed for each guest, 
When, lo! a 
tall stranger appeared—drained his cup, 
He ate all the cabbage and cucumbers up, 
And nothing was left for the rest. 
Oh! then, Billy Goose, while his hair rose on high, 
Cried, " Sir, who, pray the devil, art thou?" 
" 
Sure enough," waS: the answer, " the devil am I 
You wished me to come, and away with you fly, 
If you were untrue to your vow. 
Come away, then, false tailor, that woman to shun, 
You have broken the oath made upon her." 
" 
Sir," Billy exclaimed, " after all's said and done, 
As out of two evils I'm forced to choose one, 
I'm quite ready to wait on your honor." 
A Bachelor is His Own Nfastor. 
I 
think I 
had better get married, 
But before the point is carried, 
argue it pro and con. 
If he meets with any disaster, 
A 
bachelor is his own master, 
He's accountable to none. 
No wife, to add to the strife ; 
No sighing, fainting, dying; 
No row, promise or vow; 
Stay out, without any rout ; 
Supper and tea, take the key. 
For a 
bachelor, 
A 
bachelor is his own master. 
Spoken. —Liberty is delightful! and why should it be sacrificed 
for a 
woman? besides, what possible use have we for a 
woman 
at all? A bachelor may go out, walk about, stay out, and no 
question asked. 
If married, you must run about with your wife 
tied to ye, like a 
kettle to a 
dog's tail, clattering in one's ears, 
and treading on one's heels. 
If a 
man loses his wife, his friends 
will soon supply his loss, but let him lose anything of value, and 
he'll see the difference. 
A 
bachelor may eat what he likes, wear 
what he likes, and kiss who he likes. 
But a 
married man—only 
let him try the last 
A 
bachelor is his own master. 
Yet I 
think I'd better get married, 
For some so long have tarried, 
They can't get a 
wife at all. 
Once gouty or rheumatic, 
Toothless or asthmatic, 
Your chance of a 
wife is small. 
Many joys, girls and boys. 
Puddings, pies, kisses, and sighs, 
Shirts aired, money spared, 
Chaste embraces, pretty faces, 
All right, if home at night, 
And besides, 
And besides, something nice for supper. 
Spoken. — What man would live alone, when he might have a 
pret ty, obliging, kind, gentle loving woman to comfort him, and 
be eosey with ? 
When a 
man has a 
IA ife, he has always buttons 
on his shirts, and never any holes in his stockings; besides, how 
miserable for a 
man to conic home at night, let himself in, every 
body gone to bed, nobody waiting for him but the rushlight. 
Who can take care of persona and purses like a 
wife, and how 
can a 
man ever be said to be starving when he has a 
rib. 
Oh, 
the delights of wedlock! lea and buttered toast. 
I'm resolved, 
I'm resolved, this moment to be married.

What Are You At ?—What Are You After ? 
I 
came to town the other day, 
To rest from all my labors; 
And hear what New Yorkers had to say, 
That I 
might tell my neighbors. 
But all I 
heard upon my word, 
Was this in every quarter: 
Some bawling out what are you at ? 
And some what are you after ? 
With your tol de rol. 
At first I 
thought that they meant me, 
And cried—what's that to you, sir ? 
If you take me a 
rogue to be, 
Fillet you know who's who, sir. 
So right and left I 
laid them flat, 
Says I,—You've caught a 
Tartar, 
Now go and cry, what are you at ? 
And bawl what are you after ? 
With your tol de rol. 
But, gosh for policemen they sent, 
And lugged me oft to prison ; 
I 
axed them what it was they meant ? 
They said to stretch my wizen. 
They took me where the justice sat, 
Who gave my purse 110 quarter; 
Which made me cry, what are you at ? 
Good judge, what are you after ? 
With your tol de rol. 
Escaping from the jailor's paw, 
I 
walked down Broadway, sir; 
Where soon a 
charming lass I 
saw, 
The fairest in the land, sir. 
Says I, I'll have a 
kiss, that's flat, 
For never lass looked smarter; 
When she squalled out, what are you at ? 
You wretch, what are you after ? 
With your tol de rol. 
But while I 
kissed this pretty lass, 
That I 
the freak might rue, sir ; 
She did my fob of gold watch rob, 
And picked my pocket, too, sir. 
So I 
went home to hang myself, 
From bed-post in my garter; 
When hostess cried, what are you at? 
Young man, what are you after ?

All Fudge. 
Some people when they're ask'd to sing, 
Will say they cannot try; 
And swear they ne'er sung anything, 
But that is all my eye. 
And that they know, 
I 
tell them— tell them so, 
'Tis fudge, it is all fudge. 
Your dandy finds it difficult, 
His gentle voice to raise; 
But he might soon be musical, 
If he'd unlace his stays. 
Oh that they know, &c.

Your bashful man's ashamed to sing, 
And makes a 
quick retreat ; 
While some reserve their notes, to frighten 
Watchmen in the street. 
Oh that they know, &c. 
Your butcher sings a 
cutting song, 
Then this excuse he'll make ; 
He trusts you will forgive him, 
Since he's at his last steak. 
Oh that they know, &c. 
Your tailor's song is superfine, 
The clerk sums up his notes; 
The vintner sings, " Oh bring me wine, 
We wish to wet our throats." 
Oh that they know, &c. 
Now I 
am not particular, 
I 
sing without excuse; 
And you will well know what to sing, 
If ever I 
refuse. 
Oh yes, I 
know, 
You'd tell me—tell me so, 
'Tis fudge,—it is all fudge. 
Now many folks with dainty songs, 
Are pregnant it is said; 
So if you pass them by, egad. 
You'll send them cross to bed. 
Oh that they know, &c. 
Now I 
have summ'd up this account, 
My aim you plainly see; 
I'm glad I've just come to the end, 
And you'll be glad as me. 
Oh that they know, &e.

Be-eutiful Bill. 
AIR :— " 
Beautiful Bells. 
Don't talk to me, it's quite absurd, 
Of dashing fellows, please ; 
I'll never listen to a 
word, 
But think you mean to tease; 
Although my heart is broken quite, 
It goes on beating still; 
For one I 
loved with all my might, 
My be-eutiful, my Bill. 
CHORUS. 
(Whist/e)—Be-entiful Bill was a 
beautiful beau, 
Beautiful Billy who bother'd me so, 
Sweetest of Williams, adorable Will, 
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful Bill. 
'Twas at a 
ball I 
met my Bill, 
He made the neatest bow; 
He squeezed my hand in a 
quadrille, 
And went on anyhow; 
He praised my toilet, thought it neat, 
As we walked to and fro; 
The things he said were very sweet, 
But then his waltzing, oh! 
Be-eutiful Bill, &c. 
The waltzing done, he said " my love, 
This balcony is nice :" 
And then, oh! foolish, fluttering dove, 
I 
let him kiss rue twice; 
And though I 
said, " Please let me go," 
Resistance was in vain; 
His lips were very near, and so 
I-I-I 
kissed him back again! 
Be-eutiful Bill, &c.

(CONOLUDED.) 
He promised we should meet next day, 
Whatever did befall; 
And so we did—up North-west way, 
The Zo-o-lo-gi-cal. 
'Twas in the Parrot-house that Bill 
Proposed a 
little walk; 
For pretty poUy-syllables 
To hear the parrots talk. 
Be-eutiful Bill, &c. 
The chatfring Parrots made a 
din, 
Enough to drive one wild; 
I 
didn't notice coming in, 
A 
lady and her child; 
Bill blushed, and though he look'd confused, 
With all the cheek in life— 
The lady then he introduced 
As Mrs. Brown, his wife. 
Be-eutiful Bill, &c. 
With hopes all crushes and tumbled down, 
I 
stagger'd to the door; 
And murmur'd faintly, " Mrs. Brown, 
I've heard that name before!" 
And that is why I'm single now, 
And shall be so until 
Some future day, when perhaps I 
may 
Take up another Bill. 
Spoken. — And the next one must be a 
superior article without 
encumbrances, quiet to drive in double harness, in fact—

I'd Blush, but I 
Couldn't Refuse Him. 
Whenever a 
lad that's good humor'd and free, 
Intreats as a 
lover to choose him, 
I 
vow in good faith I 
can't possibly see 
What reason I'd have to refuse him! 
Instead of considering his suit as amiss, 
With smiles I 
would kindly amuse him ;-
And should the dear creature solicit a 
kiss, 
I'd blush, but I 
couldn't refuse him! 
When talking of marriage I 
utter a "VOW, 
With caution I 
then would pursue him; 
But if he were constant I 
cannot see how 
I 
could have the heart to refuse him. 
Why should any lass to comply be afraid, 
And run such a 
hazard to lose him? 
She soon may be sorry, and die an old maid, 
Who makes it her boast to refuse him.

Come Along Do. 
Sung by Fred. French. 
Before I 
was married, I 
went where I 
liked, 
And did just whatever I 
chose; 
But now, when I'm out I 
look like a 
lout, 
I'll tell you the cause of my woes: 
It's the Missus—she's jealous of people and things, 
I 
assure you, 'pon honor, its true— 
I 
never can stop for a 
moment alone; 
But she'll sii-y: ' Oh ! come along, do." 
crcoRus.—Come along do, come along do; 
What are you staring at ? come along do; 
Come along di5, come along do, 
You ought to know better—so come along do. 
If a 
damsel by chance in the street I 
should meet, 
And my eyes hap' to wander that way; 
My wife will remark: that's a 
dozen at least 
At whom you've been staring to-day. 
Who is she ? you know I'm certain of that, 
Don't say she's nothing to you— 
Very well, if she's not, it's suspicious at least, 
"Don't stare then, but come along do." 
Come along do, lee. 
To Dr. Kahn's Museum I 
took her, one day, 
To study the classical nude; 
She thought that Venus and Jupiter were 
Underdressed and decidedly rude. 
The beauties of Venus I 
tried to point out, 
When into a 
temper she flew, 
" 
She's worse than Mazeppa, it's awful, she said, 
I'm ashamed, sir, so come along do." 
Come along do, SEc. 
Now whatever I 
do, and wherever I 
go, 
I've been so annoyed that now I 
Have made up my mind the same sort of game 
Upon the old lady to try. 
So whenever she stops at a 
shop for a 
look 
At a 
bonnet or anything new, 
I 
use her own words as I 
tug at her arm, 
And say: " Sarah Ann, come along, do." 
Come along do, &c. 
I 
hope I 
amuse you in singing this song, 
For somehow or other I 
know 
That if my old lady she should come along, 
She'd say it's time for me to go. 
But there's one consolation—my song's nearly done, 
And p'rhaps you are thinking so too; 
But I'll settle the matter and say to myself, 
" 
Old fellow, now come along do." 
Come along do, ..tc.

A Cutting Story. 
Ala :—" 1i fum, ti fum." 
I 
now lay before ye 
A very funny story; 
It's of a 
beau— one Thomas Toe 
'Who lov'd Miss Tamer Tory. 
Indeed he did! oh, yes he did. 
CHORUS. 
Rumple, tumple, toody iddy, 
Toe and Tamer Tory. 
A 
milliner was she, sir, 
ir 
A 
linen draper he, sir. 
Genteel, polite, good-looking, light, 
And very much like me, sir: 
Indeed he was ! oh, yes he was ! 
Rumple, tumple, &c. 
Whene'er they had a:meeting, 
'With fruit she wanted treating; 
She thought that loving was like pudding. 
The proof was in the eating 
Indeed she did! oh! that she did! 
Rumple, tumple, &c. 
His time was at her leisure, 
His shop was at her pleasure ; 
He served her first, and gave her trust, 
And the very best of measure. 
Indeed he did! oh, that he did! 
Rumple, tumple, &e. 
One day he saw her pass, sir, 
And bowing to the lass, sir, 
He bowed so low, his head somehow 
Popped through a 
pain of glass, sir, 
Indeed it did! oh, yes it did! 
Rumple, tumple, &c. 
No face then e'er could match his, 
To heal his cuts and scratches, 
The doctor choose his cheeks and nose 
To cover with black patches. 
Indeed he did! oh, yes he did! 
Rumple, tumple, & c. 
He after this disaster 
Became Miss Tory's laughter, 
And in his shop he looks cut up, 
For she cut him ever after. 
Indeed she did! oh, yes she did! 
Rumple, tumple, &c.

A New Bundle of Wants. 
I'll sing you a 
song about wants, 
Its a 
song that you're wanting of me: 
I 
don't want to make you all sad, 
But I 
want to add much to your glee. 
We all of us wants have enough 
Through this life as we travel along; 
And my first and my greatest of wants, 
Is—I 
want to please you with my song. 
A man that's in want of a 
place, 
You'll say that no fate can be worse; 
A man that's in want of some money, 
He's not much in want of a 
purse. 
A man that's in want of his teeth, 
Had better give over nut- cracking; 
And he that wants shoes to his feet, 
Needn't lay out his money in blacking. 
The ladies, Lord bless 'em! have wants, 
I 
hope they'll not take it amiss; 
Little miss wants to be fat mamma, 
Fat mamma wants to be little miss; 
The old ones they want to be wed, 
The young ones to flirt with their beaux; 
But I'm certain that both old and young 
Have long been in want of more clothes. 
A man that's in want of tobacco, 
He cannot want much with a 
pipe ; 
And he that's in want of a 
dinner, 
May want half a 
yard of fat tripe; 
The man that has corns on his toes, 
Wants a 
smooth road instead of a 
rough ; 
And the man that's no nose on his face 
Must want a 
new way to take snuff. 
The man that's in want of a 
leg, 
Will make but a 
very poor runner; 
And he that's in want of an eye 
Will make but a 
pitiful gunner. 
Our enemies' wants are supplied. 
Our soldiers will keep them retreating; 
Our generals gave em their wants, 
For they gave them a 
terrible beating. 
I 
Couldn t 
Help Laughing it Tickled mcs. So. 
From morning till night I'm indulging in mirth, 
I've always been so since the day of my birth, 
I 
grin like a 
Maltese cat all through each day, 
And never feel right unless laughing away. 
My infantile actions were certainly wild— 
All folks said I 
was a 
most wonderful child, 
And when first short-coated, I'd have you to know, 
I 
couldn't help laughing it tickled me so.

Ha! ha! ha! ha! ho! ho! ho ! ho ! 
I 
couldn't help laughing it tickled me so. 
And when by degrees, I 
had reached man's estate, 
I 
then looked about in search of a 
mate, 
My eyes soon I 
set on a 
girl tall and fair, 
And begg'd that my heart and my home she would share. 
And while so persistently urging my claim, 
She gave her consent, and at last the day came, 
But, when in the morning to church/we did go, 
I 
couldn't help laughing it tickled me so. 
Ha, ha, S:c. 
I'm fond of a 
game, I'm a 
good one to chaff, 
At all kinds of mischief I'm certain to laugh, 
I 
oft play a 
lark on some innocent elf, 
Nor care though the laugh should be turned 'gainst myself. 
I 
once, walking out, saw a 
man in a 
fit, 
To make him come round I 
his ear quickly bit, 
And when he jump'd up, knocked me down with one blow, 
I 
couldn't help laughing it tickled me so. 
Ha, ha, &c. 
My landlord once called for'his two quarter's rent, 
But I 
couldn't pay it because it was spent, 
So, off to a 
broker he went very quick, 
And vowed he would seize upon every stick. 
Before he could get back, I 
gave him leg bail, 
For I 
shot the moon, but got caught, put in jail, 
And though plac'd in " limbo " for what I 
did owe, 
I 
couldn't help laughing it tickled me so. 
Ha, ha, & c.. 
Three times in succession my partner had twins— 
My place to look like a 
small school-room begins, 
Throughout all the day there is nothing but glee, 
For all of them have laughing fits just like me. 
The last time, to add to our family joys, 
To me three presented, a 
girl and two boys, 
When I 
saw three cherubs all of a 
row, 
I 
couldn't help laughing it tickled me so.

It's Funny When You Feel That Way. 
Sung by Tony Pastor. 
I 
shan't forget- how queer I 
felt, 
When first I 
fell in love; 
I 
had a 
most severe attack 
Through squeezing a 
lady's glove; 
But a 
lovely hand was in it— 
As I 
waltzed with her so gay, 
I 
thought myself in paradise— 
It's funny when you feel that way! 
CHORUS. — I 
felt as though I'd tumbled into honey, 
And somebody had left me all their money, 
The feeling's so peculiar and funny— 
Oh! it's funny when you feel that way! 
I 
took her down to supper, 
And I 
sat down by her side; 
I 
helped her to the " niceys," 
And I 
filled her glass, with pride: 
In fact, paid such attention, 
That she viewed me with dismay; 
For I 
moved my chair so close to hers— 
Oh! it's fanny when you feel that way! 
I 
felt as though, &c. 
When the affair had broken up, 
Behind I 
yet did linger; 
Before I 
tore myself away, 
I 
kissed her little finger: 
I 
threw " phantom kisses" at the house, 
As I 
tripped on home so gay; 
I'd have kissed the knocker on her door— 
Oh! it's funny when you feel that way! 
I 
felt as though, iScc. 
We met again one afternoon, 
And, as we were alone; 
I 
plucked up nerve to ask if she 
Some day would be my own. 
She blushed and said: " Go see Papa, 
And ask him if I 
may ?" 
I 
danced a 
can-can round the room— 
Oh! it's funny when you feel that way! 
I 
felt as though, Ste. 
The old boy said: " That we might wed," 
And so he crowned my bliss; 
And I 
shall be a 
doubled man, 
In about a 
month from this: 
It seems as though the time, somehow, 
Would never pass away; 
I 
long to hear the wedding bells— 
Oh! it's funny when you feel that way!

Miss Patty Puff and Her Two Sweet-hearts 7 
Olt, THE DUEL A LA—MODE. 
There was a 
gay man-milliner, his name was Timmy Twist, 
And at making caps and bonnets he'd a 
mighty pretty fist, 
With his snips and shreds and fitting heads, 
his gauze and gimp, long thread and needle; 
Oh! he loved a 
pastry-cook, and he 
thought her heart to wheedle! 
Whack falare, bow, wow, wow. 
There was a 
spruce shoemaker, a 
dabster at an awl; 
They call him Billy Boot, and he kept a 
pretty stall, 
With his last and shoe, and lapstone too, 
his wax-end, grinding- strap and hammer; 
! 
he loved this pastry- cook, too, 
and told her many a 
crammer. 
Whack falare, bow, wow, wow. 
Miss Patty Puff, thus loved by both, 
and loving both, they say, 
Was like the donkey in the tale, between two stacks of hay; 
With her flames and darts, and apple-tarts, 
her ices, trifles, cherry brandy: 
Oh! she knew not which to choose, 
for she thought them both the dandy! 
Whack falare, bow, wow, wow. 
The rivals fought—the seconds charged 
their pistols for attacks, 
Timmy Twist's with cotton balls, 
And Billy Boot's with cobbler's wax; 
With their jeers and jokes, a 
funny hoax, 
their powder, priming, and their paces, 
Though they'd courage in their hearts 
they'd dish- clouts in their faces. 
Whack falare, bow, wow, wow. 
The seconds signal gave to fire— 
when Timmy swooned away, 
And Billy, not observing it, ran off without delay, 
With his paste, and pegs, and nimble legs, 
While both the seconds laugh and hoot him— 
Oh! he stuck fast in a 
hedge, and 
roared lest Tim should come and shoot him 
Whack lalare, bow, wow, wow. 
Now, all ye modern heroes, who'd your 
credit save from fright, 
Be sure to tell the constables when challenges you write, 
With your guns t,nd swords, and great big words 
that off weak stomachs come so clever: 
Oh! they'll bind you to the peace 
and you may brag as much as ever— 
Whack falare, bow, wow, wow. 
Polly Cox. 
There is a 
place of great resort, 
In town, though not the best end; 
Famed for holding many a 
court, 
'Tis St. Giles, near the west end. 
One Polly Cox, a 
single maid, 
Lived near the Seven Dials; 
And would you know what was her trade, 
She dealt in rags and phials. 
I 
Two young men wished to gain her heart, 
, Both handsome, and the first man 
k 
Was a 
coalheaver, so spruce and smart, 
And t'other was a 
dustman. 
Now Polly candidly confessed 
, Them both as sweet as honey; 
But she loved the coalheaver the best, 
'Cause he could yarn most money. 
And so it looked just like as if 
The coalheaver had winned her; 
(And the dustman's heart was in a 
miff, `. 
And burnt up to a 
cinder. 
( 
But Poll did not like him to go, 
She thought it a 
fine thing, sirs; 
And the way to have two strings to her bow, 
• Was to keep two beaux to her string, sirs. 
, 
Soon love had got the upper hand 
Of both of these two. fellows ; 
And Polly being at a 
stand, 
Why both of them got jealous. 
She told 'em that was very low, 
Though to say so she was loath, sirs; 
i 
But sooner than they should make a 
row, 
She'd be content with both, sirs. 
These words the dustman didn't heed, 
He was a 
greedy elf, sirs; 
rAnd he said his heart's blood all should bleed, 
But he'd have her all himself, sirs. 
The coalheaver, as obstinate, 
Did in the same course run sirs; 
' 
And vowed whatever was his fate, 
He'd have the whole or none, sirs. 
To each other they'd not much to say, 
As quarrels they were right for: 
And so they pitched upon a 
day, 
When Polly they would fight for. 
4 
Polly Cox —[CONCLUDED. 
The dustman he had got most length, 
And he bid his foe defiance; 
But the coalheaver could boast of strength, 
And a 
goodish bit of science. 
It would have done your eye-sights good, 
If you the fight had seed, sirs ; 
The dustman nearly six feet stood, 
Though he was baker-kneed, sirs. 
But coaly's fist was near the size 
Of a 
decent leg of mutton ; 
And when it caught the dustman's eyes, 
He owned he wasn't no glutton. 
So coaly proved the better stuff, 
And the dustman's pain was such, sirs; 
He not only owned he had enough, 
But a 
precious sight too much, sirs. 
He fighting didn't Me at all. 
As dows'd was both his glims, sirs; 
He'd stand some gin, but as for Poll, 
She might go to h-11 for him, sirs. 
The dustman he felt nation sad, 
'Cause he had got such a 
wopping; 
And the coalheaver ran oft right glad, 
And never thought of stopping. 
He was thinking what his Poll would say 
To him, her fancy tighter; 
When he found his Poll that very day, 
Had mauried a 
lamplighter. 
This put him into such a 
funk, 
He ne'er his fate resisted; 
He went and got most precious drunk, 
And for a 
soldier listed. 
Ma'am Polly she was put to bed, 
About seven months too soon, sirs ; 
And the dustman he was transported 
'Cause he found a 
silver spoon, sirs. 
So there's an end of these two chaps, 
It all your hearts must shock, sirs; 
When you think of their unlucky haps, 
All through that Polly Cox, sirs. 
Young men, I'd have you all beware, , 
Through St. Gile's as you rove, sirs; 
,Look at the girls, but pray take care 
You do not fall in love, sirs.

SEWING UP OF TIMOTHY STITCH'EM. 
At a 
village in Ohio, as I 
have heard tell, 
Lived a 
tailor, called Timothy Stitch'em, 
Who could sigh, and could groan, aye, and preach very well, 
So the neighboas all feared he'd bewitch'em. 
He would oftentimes tell them a 
comical tale 
About religion arid cabbage so neatly, 
When collected together their minds to regale, 
He'd measure out a 
Sabject completely. 
Spoken. — Now, my friends, I 
shall cut out my subject by a 
well 
shaped pattern, which no doubt will fit you as close as wax— 
there are many of you whose understandings are become thread-
bare, and, if you are not turned from that coat of wickedness, old 
Nick will cabbage you, to a 
dead certainty; but I 
hope no one 
present will be such a 
goose as to get within the length of his 
sleeve-board, if you do, you will make a 
devil of a 
job of it, he 
will rub down your seams and work up your button holes, so that 
you will be ready. to • 
Sigh away, die away, 
Moan away, groan away, 
What comforts must certainly reach ' em, 
Such sighs, and such cries, 
How they turned up their eyes 
At the sight of little Timothy Stitch'em. 
Now Stitch'em oft visited a 
farmer hard by, 
Who heeded but little his advice; 
But the wife on this doctrine would always rely 
And believed he could mend her in a 
trice; 
So Timothy finding the farmer was deaf 
To all he might preach, sing, or pray, 
He would take care to visit his dear loving wife, 
And console her when he was away. 
Spoken. — Yes, Timothy always avoided the presence of Farm-
er Fusty, in order to comfort the wife with his devout doctrine, 
and also to comfort himself with some good cordials which she

market, they, not expecting him back very soon, took the oppor-
tunity of regaling themselves with cups of comfort, prayers, and 
what else I 
can't say, out this love feast had such an effect on 
their spirits that they began to 
Sigh away, die away, 
Moan away, groan away,

SEWING UP OF TIMOTHY STITCH EM.—CONCLUDED. 
Such sighs and such cries, 
You'd have turned up your eyes 
Had you seen little Timothy Stitch'em. 
Now the fire being warm, and their spirits so cool, 
They both fell asleep very quick ; 
When some knowing wag sook a 
peep through the key-hole, 
And opening for mischief to seek : 
Then, hearing them snore, he stole a 
black cat, 
Then soon mounted to the chimney-top, 
To her tail tied straw, with an old dirty hat, 
And bundled her d _Alm neck and crop. 
Spoken. — Yes, pussy descended the chimney very quick, with 
her straw packed up behind her, as if she was set out on a 
long 
journey, but unfortunately, her Lurthen caught fire, so running 
to the pious couple for protection, set their garments on fire, 
there was a 
pretty blaze altogether, and their fright caus'd them to 
Sigh away, die away, 
Moan away, groan away, 
What confusion must certainly reach'em, 
Such sighs slid such cries, 
You'd have turned up your eyes, 
Had you seen little Timothy Stitch'em. 
This woman, through fear, called for help so loud 
That the neighbors were struck with amaze; 
Who assembled so fast that a 
wonderful crowd 
Caine to see Mr. Stitch'em in a 
blaze; 
Now the farmer arrived in the midst of the clatter, 
And with wonder he began to stare; 
Soon the neighbors did explain the truth of this matter, 
When he raved like a 
man in despair. 
Spoken. — Well, this is a 
pretty rig! but, however, I'll soon 
cool their courage and heat at the same time, by tying them to-
gether with a 
cart-rope, and sending them to hunt water-rats at 
the bottom of the horse-pond ; I 
think it is proper they should 
have a 
soaker after their scorcher, so I'll let them stick fast in

At home and trembling by the fire 
The lovely Molly Dimpling sat; 
Much did she wonder and admire 
What her Johnny could be at. 
That night, as she lay in her bed, 
Her chamber door flew open wide; 
When the gardener's ghost popped in his head, 
With his little dog trotting by his side. 
Tall as a M ay-

By golden gifts of magic power; 
If she a

She would prefer some bags of flour.

did not play with Jennie's heart, 
Nor try to fix it were it fickle; 
But sent raistrustinE modern art,

I 
did not give her rubies red, 
To lend her raven hair relief; 
But what would charm when we were wed— 
A 
good supply of potted beef. 
I 
did not wanton with her love, 
That pined to nestle on my breast; 
Just like a 
drooping, tired dove, 
But sent a 
couch where it could rest. 
I 
did not, when the moon was bright, 
Take Jennie out for tranquil walks; 
But took her—what would more delight—

A 
dozen each of knides and forks. 
I 
did not send her flowers bright, 
Whose brightness, ah! so quickly wanes, 
But sent her, in the darkest night,

Would furnish well an ivied cot;

The Can-Can. 
Those Tassels on the Boots. 
As Sung by Elsie Holt, at the Waverley. 
'Twas at a 
fancy ball I 
met my charmer fair, 
'Midst waltzing swells and dashing belles, 
The prettiest dancer there. 
I 
watch'd her while the music play'd 
The latest waltz of Coote's, 
And fell in love—no! not with her, 
With the tassels on her boots !—oh, yes! 
Spoken.—Yes, through those little peep-holes in that pretty 
white petticoat I 
could plainly see— 
Those tassels on the boots, 
A 
style fin sure that suits 
Our Yankee girls with hair in curls, 
Those tassels on the boots. 
I 
watched her up the stairs, where we to supper went, 
Upon those tassels on her boots, my soul was so intent; 
They asked me to propose a 
health, 
Said I, here's one that suits; 
So fill your glasses up and drink, 
" 
To the tassels on the boots." 
Spoken.—I 
meant to clink the ladies' healths, but I 
could think 
of nothing else but— 
Those tassels, &c. 
I 
asked this girl " if I 
might calr?" she sald, " you may, 
But tell me why you gaze upon the ground in such a 
way ?" 
You're sad, perhaps, for life is full of very bitter fruits." 
" 
Oh no," I 
said, " I'm looking at those tassels on your boots." 
Spoken.—What is a 
more lovely sight, when you walk down 
Broadway than to look at— 
Those tassels, &c. 
I 
called on her next day, and Cupid's cruel shoots, 
Soon made me throw myself before those tassels on her boots. 
Now when we're married, and we've got a 
lot of little toots, 
I'll make them, boys or girls, wear tassels on their boots. 
Spoken.—If I 
were to have fifty children thershould every 
one wear those pretty, pretty, pretty— 
Those tassels, & e. 
A 
girl who lives up our Court, 
Served me as she didn't ought; 
And made made of me a 
cruel sport, 
Though after her I 
ran. 
She knocked my heart to smithereens, 
All for a 
chap of larger means, 
Who made Java coffee out of beans, 
While she danced the Can-Can. 
CHORUS. 
And like a 
fairy she would glide, 
Over the stage from side to side, 
While every one with pleasure cried 
How well she does the Can-Can. 
I 
used to stand at Union Square, 
Just to pick up odd jobs there. 
My passion there I 
did declare, 
She told me she loved me. 
I 
never thought that she would jilt, 
On wedding her my hopes were built, 
I 
bought the ring—'twas silver gilt, 
And cost me one and three. 
Yet like a'fairy, &c. 
One afternoon with feelings gay, 
I 
to her house did go straightway, 
I 
asked her for to name the day, 
But oh ! what did I 
see ? 
My rival on his bendecl. knees, 
A 
giving of her hand a 
squeeze.

didn't think it quite the cheese, 
It looked so awful free.

But she says, and gives him such a

To marry him I

My reasons they are various, 
My objections to you serious, 
Your living is precarious, 
And not like selling beans. 
Yet like a 
fairy, &c. 
Now just to think how things go queer, 
He married my Sally dear, 
She often drops a 
bitter tear, 
And wishes she was free. 
He, poor chap, is altered too, 
And she a 
regular tyrant grew, 
She whacks him till he's black and blue,

He Was Such a Queer Old Man. 
Old Mr. Foss was very stout, 
• 
And scarcely three feet high; 
His legs were swell'd up with the gout, 
And he squinted with each eye. 
Rut he long'd to get a 
wife, good lack 
So sought one to trepan; 
He'd a 
monstrous hump upon his back, 
He was such a 
queer old man! 
At balls and routs he tried to be 
The star of all the stars; 
He thought no one so smart as he, 
E'en swells with their cigars! 
He ogled at each belle he saw, 
And leer'd behind each fan ; 
While the damsels cried with fright—" Oh la! 
What an ugly queer old man!" 
But yet in spite of all their fun, 
his pride they could not cure; 
Of charms, he said, the belles, not one 
Was any connoisenr. 
A 
rich old dame at last did fix, 
Her eyes, his charms to scan, 
And with him in the dance did mix, 
And pinch'd the queer old man. 
Her legs were bent just like two bows, 
Being spoil'd while out at nurse ; 
But yet a 
charm she could disclose, 
In a 
thumping well-fill'd purse ! 
So Foss he vow'd to court her straight, 
And at nigh, in her sedan, 
He went home with her tete-a-tete, 
Although such a 
queer old man! 
What vows he made I 
cannot say, 
But ever from that night, 
The humpback'd man and her so gay, 
Together met the sight! 
He said he was a 
rich old cova, 
So did her heart trepan; 
She vow'd that him she'd only love, 
So got spliced to the queer old man! 
Next day he brought home to his spouse, 
Twelve little brats, good lack! 
Who quickly settled in the house, 
And each had a 
hump on his back! 
• 
He Was Such a Queer Old Man.—[CONCLTJDED. 
They squinted all, and with each eye 
With fear she did them scan; 
Each honbled, and with mouth awry, 
Just like the queer old man. 
" 
Whose brats are these ?" the lady cries, 
With looks not quite divine ; 
" 
Look at their beauty," Foss replies, 
" 
And then you'll know they're mine. 
I 
wanted one the lot to keep. 
And fill their kites with scran ;" 
" 
And what are you ?" " A 
journeyman sweep," 
Exclaimed the queer old man! 
The lady fainted at the news, 
And made a 
woful noise; 
A 
dreadful knot was wedlock's noose, 
And crook:A went her joys ! 
With grief that night she hang.d 
herself, 
Pity her all who can ; 
While all her goods and all her pelf 
Were naird by the queer old man.

And where I

Nay, should my fan or thimble fall, 
Must pick it up for me. 
Was ever proud man brought so low, 
Such trifling to be at ? 
Sure not !—but then, don't tell him so; 
I 
beg you won't do that. 
The artful creature's bought a 
ring, 
And says, I 
know what for ; 
But this I

But then,-0, pray, don't tell him so;

Doctor Anthony Brown. 
There lived in a 
country town 
A 
doefor, named Anthony Brown, 
Who, as he got nothing by trade, 
Made love to a 
wealthy old maid, 
So ugly she hadn't a 
charm, 
But her purse was as long as my arn, 
What a 
bait for Doctor Brown! 
One day, with a 
grace debonair, 
He asked for a 
lock of her hair; 
Says she, you embarrass me quite, 
Doctor Brown, you're so very polite, 
She gave it, and he was all gig, 
But soon found ' twas a 
lock of her wig; 
What a 
dose for Doctor Brown. 
Her teeth, all so white, he'd declare, 
Made amends for the loss of her hair; 
She fancied the tooth-ache by way, 
Of seeing the Doctor one day, 
When her teeth were all false, he said, 
For she'd but a 
colt's tooth in her head, 
Which fastened on Doctor Brown. 
Fine sonnets he wrote on her eyes, 
And praised them up to the skies; 
But the day he his passion declared 
A thing happened at which he stared, 
Whilst she ogled the Doctor, alas! 
Out tumbled a 
peeper of glass; 
What a 
sparkler! quoth Doctor Brown. 
One hand fixed on with a 
screw, 
Her legs wasn't a 
pair, though two; 
But the Doctor, who courted her purse, 
He took her for better or worse ; 
And their child was born, or they lie, 
With a 
wig, wooden hand, and glass eye.
