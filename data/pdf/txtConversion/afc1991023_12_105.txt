Interview at home/workshop of Joe Reid, garvey builder 
from Waretown, NJ. 
NMO1: 
Reid, James 
(Joe's son and "apprentice"), the customer for whom Joe 
is 
building the garvey currently under construction)

TX01: G—Waretown: 53GT I went to Joe Reid's on this afternoon in 
order to speak with his son, 
in the interest of getting the 
apprentice's point of view, and with the customer, 
in order to 
get that point of view. 
On the previous day, Joe had said that 
both would be at the workshop the following day. 
I arrived late 
in the afternoon and went into the workshop to greet Joe. 
I 
spoke with Joe and his wife, Gladys, for a while, then went 
outside to the area where James and the customer were. 
I asked 
if I could record some of their conversation, was given 
permission, then went to fetch the recording equipment. 
I directed my 
initial questions to James. 
(I should note 
here that as I turned the Nagra on an airplane was passing 
overhead and the customer was operating a table saw nearby. 
So, 
my first question is not audible.) 
My next question is also 
inaudible, but I remember that I asked how one could distinguish 
his father's style of garvey from those of other builders. 
James 
answered that it was difficult to do that without the boats 
in 
front of him, but proceeded to make some comments. 
He said that 
some of the builders make garveys with short, blunt bows, and 
"some of em run em out real 
long", and have sharp or pointed 
bows. 
He also mentioned that garveys are often "put together" 
differently by different builders. 
He said that some builders, 
especially those from the Tuckerton area, bolt the battens on. 
This comment is significant because it points to the 'possibility 
of regional differentiation within the Barnegat Bay area among 
Carroll-83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 1 
boat builders. 
This may need to be 
looked into at a later date.) 
He indicated that "we" (meaning he and his father) nail the 
battens in. 
In pointing to this difference, he critiqued the 
bolt method, saying that it 
is difficult to keep the bolts "true" 
when they are run down into the battens, and difficult also to 
check them in order to see if they are holding. 
He mentioned the 
work of Sam Hunt, and said that the differences are noticeable in 
his garveys. 
I asked if Sam built garveys, and James replied 
that "He's mainly doing sneakboxes now cause there's more demand 
for it." 
James noted that some people with an untrained eye will 
look 
at them and simply note that they are boats, that differences are 
either unnoticeable or do not "mean anything." 
He used the 
example of his wife here. 
(At this point, Joe Reid emerged from 
his workshop to check on the progress that his customer was 
making on the cabin, and they got into a conversation that is 
audible on the tape, to the point that my conversation with James 
is difficult to distinguish.) 
I asked why different builders 
adopted different styles, suggesting that it might be for 
aesthetic reasons. 
James corrected me, saying that a builder 
builds according to how he thinks it works best. 
James explains about the technique of raising the bow of the 
garvey, which is related processually to the technique of 
"springing the sides" of the boat. 
I asked how raised bows 
worked in the water, and James answered that it depended on how 
the bottom of the boat was shaped. 
(I am getting a sense here of 
the boat construction as a system. 
Unfortunately, I did not 
pursue this line of questioning.) 
He indicated the garvey that 
was lying 
in the yard nearby, and pointed out some of 
its 
morphological features, as well as what repairs it needed. 
He 
indicated that the customer was going to do the repairs, noting 
that "he just wanted some place to put it, you know, maybe some 
advice and help." 
(This is 
of extraordinary importance. 
Joe 
Reid's place is a center of boat building and repairing activity, 
not all 
of 
it done by Joe, but much, 
in fact practically all, 
it 
seems, of 
it overseen by Joe. 
Note that the customer is working 
there, 
in part under Joe's supervision--he uses some of his own 
tools and some of Joe's, and that the owner of the small garvey 
will also work there, probably also with Joe's help. 
This 
is 
something that will be followed up.) 
I asked if people do that a 
lot, that is, 
come up to Joe's place to work. 
He said yes, and 
that this was because they "needed some advice on how to go about 
it." 
James noted that there are lot of clammers who are capable 
of doing the work, but they know carpentry, not boatbuilding, and 
therefore need a guiding hand. 
James talks about the differences 
between boatbuilding and carpentry. 
In the main, carpentry 
involves straight angles, while "on the garvey, there's nothing 
square." 
He said that the stern is square with the center line, 
"but that's about it." 
I noted that that was "funny", meaning 
Carroll-83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 2 
"odd", because the garvey, I thought, 
is generally conceived as a 
"big square boat." 
James elaborated a bit, and repeated that the 
stern and the bow should be square with the center line. 
"From 
then on", he said, "everything changes." 
He pointed to the 
curved sides, the flared verticals, angled sterns to accomodate 
the outboard. 
I mentioned that Sam Hunt had once said there's 
nothing square on a sneakbox, and 
it turns out that there's 
nothing square on a garvey either. 
I pursued this subject, noting that James' father had 
described the garvey as a box, a working platform. 
James agreed 
with this characterization, noting that the "boxier it 
is the 
better it sits 
in the water." 
He turned to utilitarian 
subjects, to the garvey as a working boat. 
Clammers often don"t 
want a cabin on the boat because it 
interferes with movement on 
board. 
Talks about breaking spray, and breakwater devices on the 
garvey and the sneakbox. 
I asked about the differences in design between a boat used 
or intended for work and a boat intended primarily for pleasure 
uses. 
James said that "you could put more flare in a pleasure 
boat", because "you don't have to 
lean against the side to work 
out of it." 
Talks about clamming and relationship of flare to 
work techniques. 
Also notes that work boats have wider decks, 
"because that's where they put the clams." 
I asked about the nature of the orders for garveys--whether 
people were mostly ordering pleasure boats or work boats. 
James 
answered that "So far it's fairly even." 
Gives some details. 
I 
asked why a person who wants a pleasure boat would use a garvey, 
and James answered promptly, "Cause it's a good bay boat. 
Uh, 
you can go places with a garvey you can't go with another boat 
cause the water gets shallow." 
Tells about a modification in 
design to increase facility in shallow water, used for shrimping. 
This design involves a "tunnel" in the bottom rear. 
Some talk 
about this modification. 
Talks about people who used the garvey to escape the marine 
police, who couldn't follow them into very shallow water. 
I 
asked why they were trying to elude the police, and he said 
"...going for things at the wrong time of the day, or going for 
things that weren't supposed to be gotten at that time of the 
year." 
Gives examples. 
I asked whose idea it was to put the 
tunnel on the garvey. 
"That I don't know", he said, "my father 
might remember. 
I don't know where that came from. 
That was one 
of those things that almost all the inboards used to have around 
here." 
More talk about the design of the tunnel, and 
its 
operating dynamics. 
Also said "Made it nice for steering 
too...turned real nice." 
James talks about devices for steering 
the garvey, and relates one design to dredging for scallops. 
I 
asked about who thought of that design change, and James said he 
didn't know. 
Carroll-83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 3 
More talk about shallow water and boat design. 
V—shaped 
boats couldn't go 
in 
less than three feet of water. 
"Of course 
the local people used to 
like 
it at one time because, uh, there 
were a few different places where any boat could get through, and 
everybody local knew it. 
Of course if they had a garvey they 
could just go wherever they felt like, and people would try to 
follow em, and they couldn't make it, they'd run aground. 
That 
was before the State started dredging and maintaining channels 
too much." 
(There several interesting things in here, 
insider 
versus outsider, and the intervention of State management 
procedures.) 
Talk about navigating in the bay, and reference 
points. 
Insider vs. outsider. 
More talk about shallow water. James: 
"Basically, for, 
considering the size and the depth of water they can go 
in, you 
can't beat a garvey, for the bay." 
More talk about flat—bottom 
boats vs. V—bottom boats. 
I ask whether there's anything that a 
garvey builder can learn from a sneakbox builder, that is, 
do 
builders of different boats "talk" to each other. 
James: 
"Unless they're total 
idiots, they can learn from anybody, 
basically." 
I pursued with a question about exchange of ideas 
in 
design, and James said that it did not occur so much in design, 
but in general ways to do things in building. 
Such as fastening 
things together, or laying things out, etc. 
James on reception 
of different builders to new ideas; 
conservatism vs. openness to 
innovation. 
James on evolution of his and his father's ideas and 
techniques about boatbuilding. 
Gives examples. 
Describes a boat 
as a "small eighteen footer", indicating how James, at least, 
categorizes size. 
Continuous change in boatbuilding: 
"I can't 
think of a single boat that we've done in the last five years 
that we haven't thought of something that coulda been done a 
little different. 
Only thing, my father would agree and say that 
you never really stop learning how to do 
it, until ya die." 
More 
examples of change. 
Changes tend to be functional, or 
utilitarian, 
in nature. 
(On this point, must look into those 
changes that were introduced as a result of pleasure—oriented 
uses, and their relationship to change of a utilitarian nature.) 
More on difference: 
"Every boat is different. 
He (Joe 
Reid) 
hasn't turned out any two boats exactly alike. 
Everybody 
wants something a little bit different." 
(Look into consumer 
i 
of I 
uence. ) 
I ask 
if he will continue to build garveys after his father 
stops working. 
Says he will. 
People have come back to wooden 
boats, have begun to turn away from fiberglass. 
Talks about 
costs in building fiberglass boats. 
I ask about the constraints 
placed on design when fiberglass is used. 
James talks about this 
in terms of models or molds that must be employed in fiberglass 
construction.

Some talk about the recorder. 
I ask the customer if I can 
ask him some questions. 
I ask 
why he wants a garvey. 
He 
answers: 
"Traditional boat. 
I've always had one." 
Indicates 
that he's had several garveys. 
Five or six. 
Last one he had was 
thirty years old, "Thought it was about time to retire it." 
Talk 
about garveys "wearing out." 
Fastenings. 
Last one sheathed in 
fiberglass, or "glass", and rotted on the inside. 
Wood? 
"It was 
a cedar boat, basically. 
It had been sheathed when it was about 
twenty years old, and covered with glass." 
I ask about blocking 
the cedar from the air, and 
if that's a cause, of rot with cedar. 
He agrees. 
"That's the 
last thing ya do before ya sell 
it to 
some unsuspecting soul. 
That's what it boils down to." 
I ask why he wants a wooden boat. 
Answer: 
"Fiberglass 
boats, too noisy." 
Indicates that they do build a fiberglass 
garvey. 
James says that fiberglass is o.k. 
if have a boat with 
lots of angles, but on a flat—bottomed boat it's not strong 
enough. 
Customer: 
"Garvey's just about the ugliest thing 
in the 
world, but it makes a dynamite work boat .... It's flat bottom, 
it's actually a working platform. 
Basically it gets ya there and 
gets ya back, but while you're out there workin the boat's nice n 
stable, you go to one side it doesn't roll." 
I ask what he uses the garvey for. 
Customer: 
"Mostly 
Carroll-83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 5 
clammin...fishin...Lotta people race em." 
But indicates racing 
boats of different design. 
Indicates used to use work boats for 
racing, then changed the design so that not the racer is "not a 
true garvey", but rather a "hybrid more than anything else." 
Talk about the speeds of the racing garvey. 
Customer: 
"They go 
faster than I wanta be travelin on the water." 
Talk about origin of garvey design. 
James says some 
attribute it to England. 
He says that there's no way to tell how 
or where it originated, "it's just kinda a word of mouth 
tradition." 
Mention Jarvis Farrell as first one to build the 
garvey in New Jersey. 
Talk about documenting origins. 
The 
sneakbox and its origins. 
Poppy Klein from Barnegat as most 
famous sneakbox builder. 
Built many of them. 
James: 
Had every 
plank or every rib numbered, so 
if owner needed a replacement, he 
ordered by number. 
Customer mentions that I should talk to 
Johnny Chadwick, Klein's grandson. 
Says he still has the shop, 
and builds one or two sneakboxes a year. 
James: 
"I don't know 
why he doesn't go 
into 
it more or less full time. 
There's a lot 
of people after sneakboxes. 
Talk about use of sneakbox as 
gunning boat. 
James talks about specific value of sneakbox, 
especially as 
ice—breaker. 
Customer used to use garvey as 
sailing boat, as a scow. 
Customer asks James for advice with a problem he's having 
in 
building the cabin. 
James offers advice. 
Customer: 
"That's a 
sterling idea." 
I mention that the cabins on garveys are 
distinctive. 
I describe them as "small" and "squarish." 
James 
says that the shape depends on how you are using the garvey, for 
work or pleasure. 
But he says that everyone conceives of the 
garvey as a work boat, so they "don't fancy it up too much." 
Talks about constructing the cabin. 
Making it look square. 
(Sounds of saw operated by customer.) 
As James talks about 
construction, customer says "Now why didn't you tell me that 
before?" 
I ask about use of cabin. 
James answers but continues, 
to advise the customer as he works. 
I ask the customer if he had a specific idea as to the kind 
of boat he wanted when he ordered his from Joe. 
Customer says he 
had one before (in fact, 
it was Joe Reid's personal boat. 
The 
customer said that "I talked him out of 
it one year." 
Joe now 
bemoans the fact that he no 
longer has a boat, but he had to give 
it up for health reasons.) 
Talk about inboard vs. outboard 
motors. 
Inboards cheaper, but he doesn't like them as much as 
outboards. 
Talk about the current owner of the boat. 
I ask the customer how he will use the boat. 
He says for 
clamming. 
I ask if he will clam full time. 
He says that it's a 
good way to make a living, but there are no benefits. 
You can't 
collect unemployment if you're injured, for example. 
James Reid 
notes the example of his father, who was a clammer all 
his life. 
"So now, he's got no pension plan coming in. 
He got social 
security cause he always paid into that from the time he started, 
Carroll-83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 6 
but that's not enough to 
live on, basically." 
I start a 
sentence, "So when you're independently employed..." 
and James 
finishes it: 
"You keep on working until ya drop." 
I ask him 
about his thoughts about building garveys on a full—time basis. 
James answers that that it doesn't pay well. 
"What it's actually 
worth and what you can get somebody to pay for it are two 
different things." 
Compares union carpenter's pay to garvey 
builder's pay, and says the cost would be prohibitive if garvey 
builder's pay were comparable to that of union carpenter. 
The 
customer interrupts jokingly to say that he wishes he could get 
one of them to build the cabin for him. 
James estimates the 
garvey builder's hourly wage at no more than five dollars per 
hour, and that of the carpenter at eighteen dollars per hour. 
James switches to talking about the difficulty in obtaining 
the lumber for the garvey. 
"Most places (i.e. saw mills) don't 
wanna cut long stuff anymore, so they can make more money cuttin 
short stuff." 
He says they make packing crates and fence posts 
out of the short cuts of wood (the wood in question here is white 
cedar). 
Can do more business in short cuts. 
Customer makes 
another comment about building cabins, and James offers another 
suggestion. 
James starts by saying "Now, 
if you wanna be sneaky 
about it...". 
What, does he mean by this? 
Is sneaky equivalent 
to "secrets of the trade"? or 
is James improvising a solution on 
the spot? 
I ask the customer if he's trying to speed up the job. 
He 
laughs and says "There ain't nothin fast about this job. 
This is 
the most aggravating work I've ever done 
in my life." 
Talk about 
short cuts by James. 
Also talks about how much work the customer 
wants done, and how much he wants to do himself. 
Indicates that 
every customer is different. 
I had asked if Joe builds a 
complete boat, from keel 
to cabin, and James had answered in the 
above manner. 
However, he then switched to more general customer 
preferences, and began talking about the different size boats 
that customers ordered. 
"It's purely a personal preference." 
Says that length depends upon what the garvey will be used for, 
but that twenty five feet is 
"about the cut—off." 
After twenty 
five, he says, you get into another price bracket in terms of 
registration costs. 
(Joe Reid and the customer are talking in 
the background now) 
I ask how long James has been building garveys, and if he 
thinks he could build one on his own now. 
He answers, "At this 
point, yeah." 
I ask how long 
it took him to get to that point. 
He says he doesn't know, but estimates that it took two or three 
years. 
I ask how a person learns to build, 
if they must "study" 
under a builder or 
if they pick it up by themselves. 
James says 
either way. 
Then says there's no single way to build a garvey, 
"Everybody develops their own way of doin it." 
(This is another 
shift in sense that may be interesting to pursue.) 
Then talks 
about how you can tell 
by 
looking at a boat who built it, because 
builders usually develop an individual style. 
Mentions that 
Carroll-83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 7 
clammers always built their own, but that they don't do that 
anymore because they "don't have the set—up", meaning tools, 
shop, etc. 
I ask 
if they built the boats in the off—season, when 
they weren't clamming. 
James answers yes, 
in the winter time. 
Then says that "You can't just survive on clammin year round." 
(Another shift, or transform, here.) 
Ice on decks, problems in 
wintertime clamming. 
The yearly occupational cycle, a 
description. 
The customer interrupts: 
"That's the ideal way to 
do 
it. 
I always kept on the clam rakin. 
I found out that I made 
out better. 
But, uh, 
it got awful boring after a while." 
Both 
agree that it's "easier to stay warm doin other things after a 
while." 
(customer) 
Talk about different occupational activities 
during the year. 
James talks about the power plant, raising the temperature 
of the water, and keeping it from freezing over in winter. 
He 
says that when he was a kid, the bay froze over completely. 
Boats couldn't get out at all for about a month each winter then. 
He says that the change brought about by the power plant at 
Oyster Creek "makes a difference." 
Says there's no water coming 
into the bay, and no tide, so there's no "surge of cold sea water 
to cool 
it off again much." 
James says that they're stuck with 
this situation now, that the power plant changed things, and that 
the changes were unanticipated by the local residents, or by the 
authorities. 
Not enough exchange between the bay and the ocean 
to "counterbalance" the effects of the station. 
I ask what that 
has caused. 
James says that fish that migrate south as the water 
gets colder no longer migrate. 
Then, when the plant shuts down 
for a day or so and the water cools, the fish die. 
Customer 
notes presence of bunker (menhaden) fish in wintertime because of 
the plant, when normally they'd be 
in North Carolina at that time 
of year. 
Talks about study sponsored by the authority that said 
the plant wouldn't change anything in the bay. 
"It's all 
bullshit", he says. 
I ask about the guys who fish south of the 
plant and 
if the plant caused a change in their fishing patterns.

TX01: G—Waretown; 49GT I begin by asking Joe Reid for basic 
information. date of birth, early life on the bay. 
Ask about 
Joe's father. 
He was a sailor from Scotland who was wrecked off 
the Jersey coast, met a local girl from Seaside, and settled 
here. 
Father's occupations. 
Father's dates. 
Some information 
about Joe's mother. 
I ask about the frequency of shipwrecks. 
Joe says lots of wrecks then, and when he was a kid as well. 
Lots of barges. 
Cut barges loose 
if weather got rough. 
People 
from towns along shore would go down and salvage from the wrecks. 
history 
I tell ghost story related to the sea and ask Joe about such 
stories. 
Joe attributes such beliefs to older people, but laughs 
at the idea of believing in them now. 
More talk about Joe's 
father, sailing, etc. 
I ask Joe about his early experiences on 
the bay. 
Started when about thirteen, to make extra money. 
Joe 
talks about early occupations. 
Did carpentry work, but didn't 
care for it. 
Lots of people did that, would try one trade or 
another, but always came back to the bay. 
Nowadays, not many 
baymen. 
Wages high with union work, so people don't bother with 
bay. 
Used to be other way around. occupations 
I ask what it was like being a kid on the bay, growing up 
around water as opposed to other types of environments. 
Joe said 
that you had a boat and would row out, have a good time on the 
water, fishing, etc. 
It was their recreation at that time. 
Not 
that many strangers, strange boats on the bay. 
Most boats on the 
bay were local working boats. 
Talk about father poling the boat 
home (his father would take fishing parties out. 
Since there 
were no outboards then, 
if the wind died out, would have to pole 
Carroll-83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 9 
the boat. 
This is more testimony to the shallow depths in the 
bay.) 
Ask about his first boat with motor. 
It was a single 
cylinder inboard. 
Joe says that in the early days, often used 
car motors in the boats, which they adapted for that purpose. 
I 
ask how they were adapted. 
Joe answered that the shaft was 
fitted to the universal by a machinist and then put in the boat. 
I ask about his first  boat. 
Says he was fourteen or fifteen 
and 
it was just a little pole garvey, without power. 
Didn't have 
a power boat until he built his,own. 
I ask where he got his 
first boat, and he says his dad had 
it and he just fell heir to 
it. 
Talks about poling garveys with a settin pole. 
His father 
would tow him out in the morning and both would clam. 
When ready 
to come in, his father would tow him in 
if 
he could get to him. 
If couldn't, would have to pole home. 
Joe says his father taught 
him the hard way. 
If the wind was wrong, Joe says that it was 
sometimes easier to push home than 
it was to get to his father. 
Repeats that his father was a hard master, went to sea at eleven 
years old, and never went home. 
I ask about the poles. 
Joe says mostly cedar, but some 
pine. 
Length about 14 feet. 
Would cut a cedar pole and trim the 
bark off. 
I ask about water depths 
in the bay. 
Joe says some 
places about 12 feet of water, but that they never push out in 
those areas. 
Middle of bay about ten feet; and area where they 
clammed were about 6-8 feet of water. 
I ask about the method of 
poling. 
Joe says that they walked right down the boat, from 
front to stern, poling. 
Joe says boats then were all 
cut up at 
the stern, that is, 
rose out of the water to eliminate the drag 
and keep the boat moving. 
Stern was out of the water, that 
is, 
last three feet cut up sharply. 
I ask how long 
it took to pole 
back. 
Joe answers, wouldn't usually go too far from home, so 
wouldn't take more than a half hour to get to where they wanted 
to clam. 
Now, travel much further, perhaps as much as ten miles, 
if clamming was good there, and with a fast boat, would take only 
a half hour. 
But in those days, a mile was far enough to go 
pushing a boat. 
Those days, no harbors. 
Everyone anchored on the shore. 
Come a nor'easter, boats would come up on bank, would sink. 
I 
ask how they were anchored. 
Answers with a stake and rope. 
Each 
bayman had his own stake down, and that was his anchoring spot. 
In those days, area not developed; meadowland owned by people who 
cut the grass for hay, and the bay shore was public as far as 
they knew. 
So bagmen tied up wherever they wanted. 
I ask how 
many boats were on the bay then. 
Joe says that there weren't 
nearly as many boats as there are now, but there were more 
clammers. 
More commercial people then. 
But not even five per 
cent as many boats as there are now. 
If had as many boats then 
as there are now, wouldn't have any place to put them, not enough 
shoreline to accommodate them all. 
Now there are harbors and 
marinas. 
Party boats then went out from public dock, and parties 
would leave from there. 
At that time, were about twenty party 
Carroll-83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 10 
boats there. 
Many kids wouldn't have a particular place to put 
their boats. 
They'd just put the boat up on the bank, anchor it, 
and depend upon it staying there. 
I ask what happened to boats when they got old, were no 
longer useful. 
Joe says many people just pulled then up onto the 
bank and left them there. 
Also, every year they burned the 
meadow off, to get rid of the old, dry hay, and lots of the old 
boats were burned along with it. 
That is, boats were abandoned 
there by their owners, and the fire, set for other purposes, took 
care of the old boat problem as well. 
Some people also cut the 
boats adrift; 
they'd cut a hole in them and set them loose. 
But 
that wasn't good, because they wouldn't sink all 
the way, just 
down to water level, where they couldn't be seen, but could, as a 
result, pose a hazard for other boats on the bay. 
Joe remembers, 
in this context, that he salvaged a sneakbox 
when he was a kid that somebody had cut a hole in to sink it. 
Joe found it, pulled it ashore, and worked for weeks on 
it. 
His 
father knew it wasn't any good, but let him work on it anyway. 
Joe says that he never did get it afloat, but it was good 
practice for him. 
I ask about his father's yearly work cycle on the bay. 
Joe 
says in those days they not only clammed, but also crabbed, but 
in those days, they didn't dredge for clams, they tonged. 
Would 
use shorter teeth so they wouldn't stab too many. 
When they're 
stabbed, they're no good. 
Family people would have flounder 
fikes; when the weather turned cold, would put the fikes in. 
In 
the spring, they all set gill nets 
in the bay (cant't do that 
anymore) for bluefish primarily, but also for fluke. 
Would also 
catch a lot of moss bunkers, which they threw in the garden (for 
fertilizer), because couldn't sell them. 
I ask Joe about the flounder fikes. 
He said they were like 
traps, with netting made of 
linen twine then, now are of nylon. 
I ask 
if made them themselves, and he said yes, children would be 
trained to knit the fikes and the gill nets. 
On rainy days, they 
would string the nets in the hall upstairs in their house. 
Would 
knit the net with two ropes, one on top and one on bottom, and 
would put cork on the top (so the net would float) and lead on 
the bottom. 
I ask about knitting. 
Joe says used needle, which 
they made out of oak, and were about ten inches to a foot long. 
Had a tongue at one end, and were sharp on top. 
Joe says he went 
up to Central Regional (a local school) as part of a State 
program. 
He showed the kids how to knit nets, how to make tong 
handles, etc. 
Talk about that program for a few minutes. 
On 
saturdays, had shows of work done in program, but mostly attended 
by adults, Joe says kids had other things to do on Saturdays. 
education 
I ask how old Joe was when he learned to knit the nets, and 
he answered about nine or ten. 
Would start with some old stuff.

(At this point, a customer came in to ask about clamming tongs, 
which Joe makes and sells. 
I turned the recorder off, but didn't 
get back to it because I had another appointment that afternoon.)

TX01: G—Manahawkin; 56GT Cross reference this log with PFP83 
RNR011-014. 
I met Ed Hazelton at the Noyes Museum in Port Republic on 3 
November, which was quite a coincidence, because Nora had spoken 
with him at his home several days before and had mentioned to me 
that we should see him together, since he is a duck hunter, decoy 
carver, model sneakbox builder, and long—time resident of 
Manahawkin. 
I arranged to meet with Ed on 4 November at his home 
at 10:00 a.m. 
Nora was there when I arrived. 
We set up the 
Nagra and microphone and began to record an interview. 
At a 
certain point in the conversation, during Nora's first tape, I 
got up and snapped some photographs. (See PFP83—CTC003.) 
The tapes with which I am concerned here are largely taken 
up with conversation about decoys, decoy carvers, and duck 
hunting. 
I intended to get around to sneakbox models, which was 
actually the purpose of my visit, but that will have to await a 
later conversation. 
Tape opens with Ed talking about decoy carving as practiced 
by duck hunters, who, some years ago, carved their own because 
they couldn't afford to buy them. 
Everybody had a certain trick 
in carving that identified a decoy as his own. 
Personal style, 
but basically, "there's only so much you can do" to personalize 
it; 
most decoys are basically similar. 
So, a carver who only 
made a dozen decoys for his own purposes may have carved in the 
manner, say, of a Harry Shourdes. 
Years later, several come out 
of a barn, where they were preserved, and a collector tries to 
Carroll-83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 13 
attribute them, but may not take into account that Ed Hazelton 
carved a dozen decoys that may be skewing the collector's 
categories. 
Point is, not much certainty among collectors, but 
project an 
image of certainty. aesthetics 
I ask what happened to gunning rigs that hunters carved for 
themselves, that is, the thousands of "anonymous" decoys. 
Ed 
answers that they were simply lost, discarded, or burnt. 
If 
frozen in on the meadows, would burn decoys for warmth. 
Remembers that when hunting years ago, would look out over a rig 
of a hundred decoys. 
What happened to them? 
Sometimes a wind 
carried them out to sea, and you wouldn't bother going after it. 
Would simply put your order in for more from local carvers the 
next day. 
Ed mentions Rube Corliss and Joe Pauls as 
local 
carvers. 
Decoys a dollar apiece. 
Probably still a lot of decoys 
in 
the area in the tops of old barns and attics. 
Knows a lady 
right in town who has a whole bunch of them and won't part with 
them, "You can't touch em. 
And she's not gonna let anybody have 
em either." 
But they "come out of the woodwork, so to speak, 
after a while." 
I say that I'm interested in seeing the decoys that hunters 
who were not also professional carvers made for their own use, 
and which may, or may not, resemble the decoys made by the more 
well—known carvers, such as Lloyd Parker or Harry Shourdes. 
But 
don't see them. 
Only decoys preserved now, I say, are those made 
by the known carvers, and others are allowed to go by the 
wayside. 
But these others are just as important. 
Ed agrees. 
Says he doesn't know any around like that. 
But can find a 
collector who would be honest enough to admit that he doesn't 
know who made a certain decoy, because those decoys that are 
unattributed may be the kind I'm looking for. 
I mention the name of John Hillman as a knowledgeable and 
reputable carver. 
Ed agrees that he is. 
And also has a terrific 
collection. 
Ed mentions Gary Giberon, who has said that "Uncle 
Fred Noyes" had a great collection, of about five thousand 
decoys, thirty—eight hundred of which were "displayable". 
Twelve 
hundred, therefore, 
in need of repair, plus about seven hundred 
rail birds (I think that Ed might have meant shore birds). 
Nora 
asks 
if anybody specializes in repair. 
Ed says no, but most 
anybody can repair them who makes them. 
I say that mostly the 
head gets damaged, and Ed agrees. 
Says that most of the "old— 
timers" before putting the head on the body, would turn it upside 
down and drive a eight penny or a six penny nail 
in the neck and 
up through the head, which had a tendency to strengthen the neck, 
because decoys were handled by the neck. 
I mention that I asked a collector some time ago how to pick 
up a decoy, and he said, "'Well, I always say you pick them up 
like you'd hold your girlfriend, by the breast and by the tail. 
(Ed 
laughs at this.) 
If you don't know the decoy, or you don't 
know the person, that's the best way to pick em up.'" 
(Ed and 
Carroll-83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 14 
Nora laugh here.) 
I ask Ed what got him started carving. 
He said he started 
about four or five years ago. 
Influenced by Bill Crammer, who 
Lem Ward says 
is "one of the best." 
Both Ed and Bill raised 
in 
Manahawkin, Ed a few years older. 
Grew up together. 
Old fellow 
in Waretown, Lloyd Cambern, used to make railbirds. 
Used wood 
five—quarters inches thick (one and one quarter inches). 
He made 
a rail bird for Toby Bennett, who lives nearby, on the corner, 
and Toby had 
it on his television set. 
So one day, Ed said to 
Toby that he'd like to take it home and see 
if he could carve one 
like 
it. 
This was five or six years ago. 
So I took it home 
and shaped some wood out. 
So thought of Bill Crammer's small 
ducks, and started carving, copying off of them, "by sight and by 
eye." 
Indicates some of the first ducks he made on the window 
sill. 
Ed says that as he was growing up there were four 
outstanding carvers in town. 
Joe Tom Crammer, who specialized in 
geese and black ducks, Joe Paul, who specialized in geese and 
some broadbills, Rube Corliss, who specialized in broadbills, but 
also made quite a few geese, and Uncle Joe Bounds, also known as 
Uncle Joe Throckmorton, because his mother was married twice, but 
everyone called him Uncle Joe Bounds. 
Remembers fishing and 
gunning with these carvers as a kid. 
Killed his first duck at 
the age of ten (he's sixty—nine now) with Uncle Joe Bounds, a 
green—winged teal, on election day, 1924. 
So, used to watch "all 
these old guys carve." 
But never picked up a knife with them, 
just watched. 
But went to school, and to war, and "just got away 
from it." 
When he returned from the war, they had died. 
But got 
to thinking that he could carve. 
Started, and now thinks it's 
"terrific therapy." 
Will never be a great carver, but Bill 
Crammer has said that he will give him pointers in painting and 
carving decoys. 
But carving just seems to be something a lot of 
guys 
in 
later years get to doing around here. 
Last couple years, 
it seems that everybody's carving. 
Even have several girls in 
town who are carving, "and doing a real 
good job." 
They usually 
carve birds, cardinals, blue jays, etc. 
I ask why, 
if everybody's carving today, not everyone carved 
years ago, since everybody hunted ducks. 
Ed says he doesn't 
know, but adds that then they had "commercial" (carvers) who 
carved for a living, and some carved "to put meat on the table" 
(because they were out of work, needed to eat, and couldn't 
afford to buy decoys). 
Says "Now I know a lotta guys, 
like 
myself, that have gunned over decoys all 
of our lives, and never 
thought about carvin. 
Now all 
of a sudden it's, I don't know, 
it's just in the air, 
it's come into its own, or somethin." 
But 
then, 
if you could afford it, you went to one of the commercial 
carvers,and went about your business, of electrician, carpenter, 
etc. 
Thinks people are fascinated by the folklore or the 
heritage, etc. 
Often asks himself why he didn't carve before, 
but doesn't know. 
Carvers had something to sell, and so did he 
Carroll-83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 15 
If they wanted an addition on their house, they'd come to him; 
if 
he wanted a decoy, he'd go to them. 
Uncle Joe bounds, he says, made a beautiful goose stool and 
a beautiful broadbill, but made them smaller. 
Mainly to fit more 
on the sneakbox. 
They were hollow, and so rode nicer on water, 
and were lighter, so could put more on the sneakbox. 
Carvers 
made all 
species, but main decoys were geese, brant, black ducks, 
and broadbills, canvasbacks and redheads. 
Might make one of a 
less common species of duck, 
like a wood duck, to about a 
thousand broadbills. 
Which is why today the rarer ducks are so 
valuable, because they're so scarce. 
Nora asks why they made so 
many of a certain type, and Ed answers that that was what they 
gunned for. 
Broadbills, Ed says, "bunched up", 
lived in rafts, 
out there, thousands upon thousands of them, and that's what you 
gunned for in the clubs, black ducks, broadbills, and geese. 
Because there were many more of them. 
A Shourdes pintail, or 
wood duck 
in mint condition is worth a fortune today because 
they're so scarce. 
Rolly Horner's geese go for sixty—five 
hundred dollars apiece now, he says. 
I mention that a Horner 
brant was estimated at fifteen thousand, and suggest that it was 
because his brants especially were very "artistic" (read: 
aesthetic" or aesthetically pleasing). 
Nora asks about influence between Barnegat Bay carvers and 
other carvers, and Ed says that there was none. 
But adds that 
Shourdes sent his decoys all 
over the country. 
Talks about total 
number of decoys, 
in the thousands, carved by Shourdes. 
Says 
people questioned whether he could have carved that many. 
Tells 
of experiment made by Bill Crammer on Shourdes' style, and 
concluded that Shourdes carved every one of the decoys people 
thought he did, and maybe more. 
Talks about numbers. 
And about 
production per day. 
Speed in carving. 
Nora asks about the 
Shourdes style, and 
if 
it got carried from generation to 
generation of Shourdes carvers (the third generation Shourdes 
carver is carving today). 
Ed says they are all different and 
distinct styles. 
Talk about Shourdes decoys. 
Ed mentions that 
Hurley Conklin told him that he carved twenty thousand decoys and 
I say that he told me the same thing. 
Talk about Hurley and his 
output. 
Ed says that Hurley can make a hundred dollars a day 
carving, 
if he wants to. 
Any known carver today will never live 
to fill their orders. 
Says that John Hamilton is Hurley's 
nephew, and he coming into his own as a carver, and there's a 
customer for every bird he carves. 
Talks about people who come 
in from the ourtside, buy a decoy directly from a carver like 
John Hamilton for forty dollars, then go to New York or somewhere 
else and sell 
it for eighty. 
This turns carvers off. 
Thinks 
Hurley gets top dollar for his birds to start with. 
And Ed can 
buy any bird from Hamilton for forty. 
I mention that Hurley 
makes a lot of mergansers today. Ed says that Hurley can get one 
hundred fifty dollars a pair for his mergansers, so Hurley told 
Carroll-83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 16 
him, and he can make a pair a day. 
I mention Harry Shourdes, who 
carves today, and always has many decoys in progress, and never a 
surplus of finished birds around his shop. 
Ed says that Harry 
does a nice job, and also has the Shourdes name, which is 
the 
cad iIlac among carvers. 
Ed tells story about Harry Shourdes, the 
original Shourdes carver, who could sit down in a barber's chair 
for a shave and whittle a duck's head beneath the apron while the 
barber worked on him, and emerge with a shave and a completed 
head. 
This is the legendary story of Shourdes' great skill. 
Ed 
says that was a true story. 
I ask why Ed didn't include Hurley Conklin in his list of 
four carvers in Manahawkin, since Hurley lived practically right 
around the corner. 
Ed says he doesn't know, that he grew up with 
Hurley, but went to the other four for his decoys. 
I ask who 
Hurley could have sold his decoys to, and Ed says probably to 
clubs, etc. 
Mentions clubs that had Conklin decoys, and 
individual gunners, 
local 
as well 
as outside gunners. 
But says 
that if 
he wanted a broadbill, just went up to Rube's CCorliss's7 
and got it. 
Never heard of Hurley. 
I say that his decoys are 
nice, and Ed agrees. 
I raise the subject of beauty, then suggest 
that aesthetics is a collector's issue. 
Ed agrees, and says that 
decoys have a job to do, to fool ducks. 
Says that in the old 
days they were allowed to use live ducks as decoys, live honkers 
and live "little bitties, we called em", black ducks or mallards. 
They were tethered to the gunning box or to the bank. 
The 
honkers would call flying ducks, was a traitor. 
Also at one time 
was legal 
to bait. 
Says he and his brother—in—law killed forty 
ducks one afternoon, thirty—two black ducks and eight broadbills. 
Twenty apiece, that was the limit that year, or at that time. 
I 
ask about guns and method of shooting. 
Ed says used just one 
double—barrel gun. 
Now can use automatics. 
Talk about guns and 
number of shells can load, what was legal, possible, etc. 
Average one duck out of every six shots for the average gunner. 
This 
is because hunters keep shooting, even when ducks are out of 
range. 
So, one out of six ducks winds up on the table. 
The rest 
of the shots are wasted ammunition, or crippled, but not killed, 
ducks. 
I ask about size of shot, and Ed begins to explain as tape 
ends.

G—Manahawkin; 56GT 
Tape opens with Ed talking about duck hunting, and how 
hunters, who are hunting together, decide who shoots at which 
duck as they fly by. 
Hunters don't shoot into flock. 
Nora asks 
about difference between hunters who hunt by themselves and those 
who hunt in groups, as members of clubs. 
Ed says that he gunned 
by himself or with one other person. 
Clubs have sink boxes sunk 
in the meadows. Used to gun 
in 
individual sneakboxes. 
Says that 
where have a group, have commercial gunning. 
With a guide. 
Three or four hunters come down and hire a local guide. 
Guide 
may or may not shoot with the hunters who hired him. 
Nora asks 
if these are a different kind of people, those who hunt in 
groups. 
Ed says no, that it's just a matter of the time, the 
money and the equipment. 
Local men didn't use a guide. 
Nora 
mentions deer hunters, and club members are from outside the 
area, and don't know the woods around here. 
Ed says that's why 
they need a guide. 
Nora asks about good hunting places that Ed would go back 
to, and whether they were places that his father had also gunned 
from. 
Ed says yes, that from years of gunning and from knowledge 
that is passed down from generations, you know which spots are 
good 
in which kind of whether and under what conditions. 
Gives 
example. 
Talks about putting out feed to lure ducks. 
Talks 
about ducks' "trading routes" and put guns and box accordingly. 
Ed talks about choosing a place and securing it by sleeping in 
it 
so that other hunters wouldn't get there before you, 
if you had 
decided previously that you wanted to gun from a particular spot. 
Carroll-83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 18 
Guides did this as well for their parties. 
Would sleep out on 
the marshes all night in their sneakboxes, with hay in them for 
warmth, they'd pull the hatch up over them, have a lot of clothes 
on them, and snuggle down 
in there. 
As time went on, the clubs began to organize, and got the 
money to buy the spots they liked. 
Then the habit of sleeping 
out all night ceased, because clubs owned the hunting spots. 
Nora asks if Ed can show her on the map where his hunting spots 
were (and are). 
Asks where or on what map they would be. 
Ed 
answers the Barnegat Bay area. 
Sound of maps unfolding. 
Ed says 
he never gunned down around Cedar Run or West Creek much. 
Location of appropriate map. 
Ed begins to orient himself on the 
map. 
Mentions places he gunned, Bonnet Island, Pettit island, 
Sandy Island (says he has a picture of men gunning from this 
spot), Harvey's (rest unintelligible, but Ed refers to a place 
where he gunned a lot because he owned land there, and I think it 
is the Harvey's spot, but this 
is not absolutely clear), North 
Pond. 
(Nora asks what he gunned for there, and he answers "black 
ducks"; she then asks if he gunned for black ducks in the "other" 
place as well, and he answers "black ducks and broadbills both." 
The name comes out as well, Long Creek, which is, I believe, the 
place where Ed owned land.) 
Mentions spots where he never 
gunned, Turtle Cove, Bear Island, Carvell's Island, but says "I 
knew all 
these fellas." Then, 
looking at the map says, "Here's my 
favorite, right here, Marshelder Island, that's the one I'm 
tellin you about. 
The best club on the coast, the nicest club, 
the money club." 
Mentions his brother—in—law, who took his vacation from his 
regular job during gunning season, when he would guide this 
wealthy club (Marshelder Island). 
"He was the type fella that 
thought like a duck. 
He thought like a duck. 
He just knew every 
move they were gonna make. 
In other words, we'd sit there, 
gunning, and have the stools out, and 
in would come some ducks. 
And they wouldn't come just the way he wanted em. 
Just exactly 
right. 
You could kill 
em, but he says, 
'They gotta do better 
than that.' 
And he would go out and he'd take this stool here 
and put it there, and this stool here and set it back there, and 
the next time they'd almost light in your lap. 
Also knew weather 
good for killing ducks. 
"He just thought like a duck all 
the 
time," Ed says. 
Knew because of certain temperature variations 
when there would be a "lid on" the bay, that is, when it would 
freeze. 
He knew that the ducks would come 
in 
to feed in the 
ponds before the freeze, and they didn't know when it would thaw. 
More talk about Marshelder Island Gun Club, which was owned 
by four wealthy men. 
Says they had everything at the club even 
in the old days, had own Delco system with hot and cold running 
water, flush toilets, nice bar, bunks, big dining room, cooks. 
"It was a great club, great club. One of the best! 
I had a lotta 
fun up there when I was a little fella." 
I ask Ed what he gunned 
for there, and he said mostly broadbills. 
I ask why broadbills 
Carroll-83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 19 
came up there, and Ed said because they were an open bay duck, a 
diving duck, that don't come in to the ponds or meadows. 
Whereas 
a black duck 
is a puddle duck, or marsh duck. 
I ask 
if 
there 
were 
black ducks on Marshelder Island, and Ed says yes, they 
gunned for broadbills, but they had a black duck pond, and they 
killed black ducks there. 
Ed returns to a perusal of the map. 
Dipper Point, North 
Pond, Log Creek Pond, Turtle Cove. 
Latter owned by wealthy 
stocking manufacturer, who had his own private club there. 
Carvell's Island Gun Club had their headquarters in Surf City, 
and Uncle Rube Corliss, carver and boatbuilder, was their guide. 
Today the island belongs to other people. 
Whalebone, Ed never 
carved there. 
Haywood Oyster pond. 
Then Ed says, "Here's where 
I spent the years gunnin, years and years and years." 
I ask what 
that is, 
and Ed says "Settin Pond." 
Shell Pond, Harry's Pond, 
plus the names of two other spots I can't make out, the tape 
is 
not clear. 
Ed now begins looking for Fresh Pond, which he can't 
find on the map, so Nora suggests that he draw it 
in. 
He does 
so, and draws some details as well, such as marsh elders 
Says 
that's where he'll be gunning next month. 
Ed says 
"So here, 
Fresh Pond, Settin Pond, and Marshelder, were my babies ... They 
were the real ones." 
Nora asks about building a blind, how to do 
it correctly. Ed 
says that years ago they gunned in sneakboxes. 
The hunter would 
out a V—notch in the meadows and pull 
the boat into it. 
Then the 
racks would be taken off of the boat, and the decoys put out, and 
then cover the boat with brush, marsh elders, or hay. 
Then sit 
down, facing over the stern, and raise up to shoot. 
Then got 
away from that, and began sinking large boxes, made by hunters, 
and had seats and a shell shelf. 
Some could hold as many as six 
men. 
These were sunk down just above the meadow surface, then 
would place sod all 
around them. 
Then take chicken wire and a 
notched stick, which, when driven down, would hold the sod 
in 
place. 
This would be done in the Spring. 
By Fall, the sod would 
have taken root, and the blind ready for the hunters. 
I ask 
if commercial hunters used sink boxes. 
Ed says no, 
just sportsmen. 
He says 
it was done to make things more 
comfortable for the paying customers. 
I ask what they were 
called, and Ed says "gunnin boxes", and says they've been around 
for fifty years. 
Box is slanted to help hold it securely in the 
meadow. 
Would also nail a two by eight or two by ten plank all 
around the box like a shelf, down towards the bottom, then mud 
and sod piled on, and the presense of the plank helped create 
suction, making it difficult for the boxes to "pop" out of 
position. 
Says they'd stay there for years, until the nails 
rusted off and the boards broke loose. 
Box also made at an angle 
in the front so that the hunter could stretch his feet out. 
Says 
there are still some boxes out there that have been there for 
years. 
Would need a boat to get out to them. 
In the Fall, when 
hunting season finished, the boxes are filled with water, 
in 
Carroll-83 Reel—to—reel 
logs

order to make them last longer. 
Says it's a great job to put 
them in, because they were made of two by sixes of cedar, or fir, 
or anything. 
Lumber bought from lumber yard, smeared with 
creosote or tar, and tongue and groove construction so they 
wouldn't leak, "And God they were heavy!" 
Last one he had was a 
three—man box, and to put it on a truck, take to meadows, 
load on 
a garvey or scow, and dig a hole for the box was a lot of work. 
Talks about problems placing the boxes. 
Then someone (he thinks 
it was his brother in 
law, came up with idea to pump hole full 
of 
water, then set box 
in, 
and pump hole out, as you did so, 
position the box properly. 
That solved many of the placement 
problems. 
Talks about pumping gunning boxes out. 
People still 
build these boxes and use them. 
But today, build them out of one 
inch marine plywood on two by fours, and then fiberglass it. 
So 
two men can now lift what it used to take six men to 
lift. 
And 
these lighter ones last just as long because of the fiberglass. 
"It's waterproof marine plywood, and, no trouble. 
Things have 
improved! 
Materials have improved." 
In the spring, after the bay guides closed everything up, 
put boats away, etc., they would go back to their trades, 
carpentry, painting, etc., but by spring or summer, would have to 
cut back on trade to prepare for duck season, repaint decoys, fix 
boxes, overhaul sneakboxes, etc. 
Cause they made a good dollar 
then. 
Old hotel on corner (The National Hotel) would be full of 
gunners. 
Gunner would come down from Philadelphia or New York 
and stay at the hotel. 
The guide would meet him in the morning 
and take him down to Hillyer's Landing and take him out in the 
power boat to the gunning place. 
I ask 
if Ed was ever a guide, 
and he says no, except for one person, a wealthy young fellow 
from Trenton. 
Ed had a four—man box up 
in Log Creek Pond. 
Ed 
also has a summer home there, so he keeps his boat docked there. 
They'd gun two or three days at a time, every few weeks. 
"we 
killed a lotta ducks." 
But there were some people who were (and 
are) full time professional guides, Ed mentions Alan Tonnison in 
this regard. 
Off—season, guides would do their regular jobs. 
I ask 
if they ever toled for ducks here, and Ed says no, but 
tells story of dog called Mike and black ducks, who would follow 
the dog back to the blind, time and time again. 
Nora mentions 
clamming dog, and suggests that he tell me that story, which is 
about a dog that Ed raised, and which digs clams up on the beach, 
then cracks the shell and eats them. 
Tape ends before this story 
can be completed, however.
