Waco Girl
WACO GIRL
Dorothy Ledford Indio, 1938
It was down around bout Waco town I usto live and dwell It was down around bout Waco
town I owned a fouring mill.
I fell in love with a Waco girl With dark and rolling eyes I ask her if she'd marry me And me
she would dispise.
I called on her at her sister's house At 8 o'clock one night I ask her if she'd walk with me
And view the meadow so bright.
We walked along and we talked along Till we came to level ground I picked up a stick of
heg wood And stroked the poor girl down down down.
She fell on her bending knees Oh mercy me she cried Oh Willie my dear don't murder me
here For I'm not prepared to die.
I paid a little attention to what she said Of course I stroke her more I stroke and I stroke
her Till the ground was a bloody core.
I wound my hand in her dark brown hair And drug her round and round I drug her down to
the water side And threw her in to drown.
I went back to my mother's house At 12 o'clock that night My mother was awakened An' in
awful fright.

Oh son, oh son, what have you done To bloody your hands and clothes The answer that I
gave her Was bleeding at the nose.
WACO GIRL
I called for a handkerchief To bind my weary head And also a candle To light me off to
bed.
I kicked I rolled I trembled down No comfort could I find The flames of hell all around me
Right in my eyes it did shine.
Bout three weeks or later The Waco girl was found A floating down the waters Who ran
thru Waco town.
They taken me on suspicion They locked me up in jail I had no one to comfort me No one
to go my bail.
Her sister swore against me She swore my life away She swore I was the very young lad
That taken her sister away.
Oh Lord they're going to hang me The death I hate to die Oh Lord they're going to hang
me Between this earth and skies.
