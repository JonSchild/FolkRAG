CH 00:00
Good afternoon and thank you for taking part in this important research project with the Archie Green
Fellowship, Library of Congress. How are you this afternoon?
PM
I’m absolutely amazing.
CH
[Laughs] Wonderful. Will you please give us your name and the year that you were born?
PM
My name is Priscilla Murphy and I was born in 1953.
CH
Where were you born and where do you currently reside?
PM
I was born and raised in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. I currently reside, in the last 30 years, in Hockessin,
Delaware.
CH
Alright. Tell us something about your family dynamic.
PM
My family was a family of five siblings, four siblings and me and my mother and father. I was raised in
North Philadelphia and Philadelphia. I have three brothers and I have one sister. Even though at this
time, most of my siblings and parents are deceased, I have a brother that is not, and he's probably four
years under me.
CH
What kind of work did dad and mom do?
PM
My dad was a welder. My dad was a welder and, you know, he started out, as he called it, piecemeal,
where you get labor for so much work. He used to say he would piecemeal in the morning and be done
and sleep the afternoon on the job. So really, when we look at it, making a quarter an hour wound up
being probably, like, $3 an hour because he didn't work in the afternoon. My mother, on the other hand,
she didn't have to work. She worked ‘cause she wanted extra money, and so she worked in housekeeping
or environmental service. Then, for much of her life, when she went back to work, she used to work for
laundromat sorting through clothes. Both of them had a fifth-grade education.
CH
What or who inspired you to become a nurse?
3
afc2021009_002
PM
My mother. My mother wanted to be a nurse but couldn't ‘cause she was raised in the south and you
gotta take care of man and family. But then when my mother, I think I was, like, seven or eight, my
mother got sick and was hospitalized, and at that point, you wanted to see your mom, you couldn't,
‘cause kids couldn't visit in those days. It really was really almost around that part of my life, I decided I
was gonna cure, ‘cause I probably didn't like the fact that I couldn't see her, and I was going to cure the
common cold, [inaudible 2:40] pneumonia, ‘cause I wasn't a person who played with dolls. It was
always microscopes, chemistry sets. No dolls; that was not my life. So, I decided to go into nursing at
that time. Then, someone helped me navigate through it when I got to high school, because they wanted
to put me in Home Ec. and I've never looked at a kitchen probably before that. So, I got to nursing
school with probably my personality and my grades, ‘cause I was always in high classes.
CH
Well, since we're talking about education, tell us about your nurse matriculation, as far as your
education.
PM
So, I started out in a diploma program. So, back in 1971, you had a three-year program and a two-year
program. There was still college, but I got into a nursing school. I was offered college and I did get a full
ride to Villanova, but my parents wouldn't have been able to afford that. So, I got a full ride to Bryn
Mawr Nursing School and finished that in three years. It's funny because I felt like God ordered my
steps because within my second year of nursing school, one they flunked me out for one point because
my shoes weren't polished every day and probably because they were mad because I had a kid. I got
pregnant in nursing school so I had a kid, but I came back. I just felt like they couldn't tell me my
destiny. So, I finished and then 10 years later, I went to Widener. A mentor of mine named Priscilla Butz
from University of Pennsylvania told me to leave the job that I was at and to go work at University of
Penn. so they would pay for my bachelor's degree and that's exactly what I did, ‘cause she had a PhD.
I'm looking at a Black woman back then with a PhD. She kinda guided me to leave to afford to get my
BSN. So, I went to Widener University to get my BSN. Then, 10 years after that, I went into counseling,
my double masters – Master’s in Counseling and Master's in Education.
CH
What type of counseling do you do?
PM 05:07
I do family, individual, couples and group counseling, all the disorders from bipolar, depression, anxiety,
ADHD. I don't do personality disorders, because you'll pull your hair out on the first day. You need
advanced skill sets for that and a lot of training, but most of the [inaudible 5:30] I cover or can at least
recognize if I need to refer.
CH
So, you do psychological counseling?
PM
I do psychological counseling, mental health counseling, yes.
4
afc2021009_002
CH
I understand that’s very much needed these days.
PM
Post-COVID, more so. You know, you hid it before COVID, but being locked in a cage for two years,
everything kind of seeped out of your pores and, you know, you kind of look around at that person and
go, “Who are you? I don't know you,” but you never got to know them. So, we had a [inaudible 6:05]
adolescence, we took normal growth and development and we locked ‘em down, so you got now a lot of
anxiety and depression and just retooling, learning how to retool your world in a world that we're still
trying to navigate through.
CH
How long have you been a nurse?
PM
I've been a nurse almost 40 years.
CH
Take us on your nurse journey. Tell us about some of your nurse experiences, the areas that you
specialized in.
PM 06:35
My nurse journey was amazing. I started out of school at Pennsylvania Hospital on a postpartum unit
and I worked under one of the finest leaders. Like, she knew her stuff, she was organized. I got from the
best. Ricker was her last name and she taught me postpartum, how to chart, how to lead. So, when I left
there to go to postpartum, then I went to the med surg side and I needed to grab those skills as well. So, I
was on the postpartum side then the med surg side. Then, I wanted to know about ENT. I'm a person
who moves around.
CH
ENT stands for…?
PM
Ear, Nose and Throat. So, I always stayed in a position for an average of 18 months and then I moved to
another division, because there was so much to learn in nursing, to not be pigeonholed in, and I just
wanted to learn everything that I could from postpartum to oncology to Ear, Nose and Throat to dialysis,
just to get it under my belt, to be skilled in many, not in one. So, I kind of did that and moved through. I
worked at various hospitals. I was, you know, staff nurse, as you start out as usual, then I was charge
nurse within maybe a year or two. I didn't pass my boards, though, the first time, but back then, if you
didn't pass your boards the first time, you could still work as a GN. The rules and roles have changed
now. I was defeated, but I knew I was gonna-- it was a matter of “when”, not “if”. Then, I went from
there to Misericordia Hospital, and I went with Misericordia because they did not have a labor, delivery,
recovery and postpartum area, pulling on that OB experience from when I started. So, I moved through
that and then I designed a $3.3 million dollar unit.
5
afc2021009_002
CH
Wow! How impressive.
PM
From design to wood, from uniforms to teaching nurses how to scrub for C-sections to writing the
policies. So, I was not just the nurse manager and the person who helped design it but to build it, but to
teach them. So, that was an expansive role of all the knowledge I had accumulated. I got the job because
I was in Florida and somebody was there and I gave my resume. They were looking for somebody to
work in Philadelphia and I lived in Delaware.
CH
How ironic.
PM
Yes, and I wound up with that and designed that unit. West Philly had not had a labor, delivery and
NICU for over 30 years. So, that’s reading, education and skill set again. All that moving gave me tools
to be able to pull this off. Then, after that, I left and did community outpatient. Then, someone saw me at
a managed care company and asked me to come out and teach asthma for the Northeast Corridor region,
you know, my Latinx population, my at-risk communities. I just went out to the schools and community
centers to educate families of color about the importance of asthma and giving a child the medication,
and really not having one family use one inhaler; everybody get their own. So, I did that. I worked for
Keystone Mercy Health Plan for several years, just learning and meeting people in the community, you
know, just moving through. So, my career has been vast. Then, I wound up teaching. I wound up
teaching at Wilmington University for 10 years as adjunct faculty, again, nursing and behavioral health,
blending my skill sets into two. Kind of from there, I started just talking to community, just doing some
speaking to help educate them about healthcare needs. Before we termed “preventative”, before that was
even your term, I was doing it in the communities. I was just doing it. I wasn't part of an organization. I
just had a gift to bring people in and people would listen, March of Dimes, anyplace. But, they didn't
have money to pay me so I kinda did it pro bono, which led me to my skills of now. I speak nationally
and all over for mental health for companies. So, all those skill sets had a little part of who I am as a
leader today.
CH
That's some worthwhile and valuable information to know that because nursing is so expansive, with
experience, that if you diversify yourself, you're prepared for the next.
PM
Yes.
CH
During your matriculation and your nurse career, did you experience any racial prejudice, biases?
PM 11:58
Yes, from the day I started. I went to an all-white school. I was one of three Blacks. I'll never forget the
day I was moving into the dorm. You know, you leave high school, you have these ideals, but those are
really not real. You have them until you hit reality. So, when we were moving in, you know, everybody
6
afc2021009_002
had limousines. This was in Mainline, so they're very wealthy. So, one of the people asked me was I the
housekeeper, not the student, the housekeeper, you see, and so that to me was probably my second
encounter with racism and understanding it. We weren't raised that way in our family, so Black, white,
that wasn't a thing for us. Our family is the whole rainbow of whatever. So, that's where I was headed.
Then, as you move through the nursing career, you're pigeonholed to the worst clients. You can't elevate.
There was a feeling of, “You think you're better than but I'm gonna put you down.” So, whenever you
went up, say, for charge or applying for a position, and because I was a diploma school nurse, you could
always block me by degrees, you know, which, later down the line, encouraged me to get a degree. So,
when I was a charge, my white counterparts had difficulty in following my leadership or my guidance.
So, you hear, you know, you hear those names of, you know, “That N word thinks she's that,” or a client,
a patient spitting at you, you know, and not having the support of the white administration, you know.
So, it's funny. We talk about prejudice and bias but during the time, it was the way it was, you know.
Your parents taught you don’t, you know, yes to authority, “Yes sir. Doctor,” titles, so, you kind of raised
with that's how they behave, but how do you navigate through a system that behaves one way and you’re
raised to embrace it all or to even undersell? Because when I look at it, yes, my parents said, “Education,
education,” but they had us look up, even if leadership, to white society, white society, and it was okay
for their time, but it wasn't okay. I had to learn the hard way, and when I say the hard way is, as I've
mentioned earlier, why I moved through 18 months, because it was only gonna be a matter of time this
thing cut across my face called mouth was gonna create havoc, because I'm a realist and I had to make
you accountable for your behavior, but the system wouldn't allow for that. So, in order for you to stay in
your profession, you needed to-- They love you for about 18 months ‘til they figure out you know what
you’re doing, you know, and then they hate you. It’s the system, so you go, “Let me move.” I get it for
my counterparts, and I have friends, they stayed on one unit for 30 years, but they never moved, they
never were elevated. They’d get all the credentials and you're still doing what you did 30 years ago and
your salary’s capped. No. That was never me, you know. I'm the middle child and I'm a rebel in my own
right, ‘cause I always knew my worth. I always knew it, but I always shunned or bowed my head when
white people came around because that's my raising, that I was less than. So, through your nursing
career, you gotta fight your own and then you gotta fight what you were raised and then you gotta fight
what you see in your nursing career, racism. It’s alive and well, you know. I learned this in my nursing
career: As long as they didn't know what I had, you know, tangible, and as long as-- even if they were
wrong, we were taught silence, then you were safe, but the minute I challenge you, it was gonna be
trouble. But, I was a single mom. I had two daughters, and one thing, thank you oppression, slavery, fear
by slaves taught me when to speak. You know, slaves were inside the house and they knew everything,
but you didn't think they knew anything. I learned that. I learned that I don't have to always go through
the front door. I could go through the side window or the back window in my behaviors and my
profession. It was the only way to elevate. I learned that very early ‘cause I'm an observer. My family
called me “the thinker”. Few words, but I watched behaviors, so I learned how to play the game to
survive. So, my nursing. So, racism, yes. Bias, yes. Even hair, you know, hair. I heard things that was
degrading to our race, you know. But in OB, the white woman who had seven abortions was okay. The
Black person that had five kids, you know, was not okay. So, you kind of learned those things, that talk
you hear amongst professionals, which is why I probably don't see many, if any, white providers. I'm not
trusting of them because they talk about you and at you at the bedside. I've learned that from my
working with them, when I had no voice.
CH
What do you think the solution is to that?
7
afc2021009_002
PM
It’s always education, but we can't keep saying education about everything. I'm sick of it.
CH
Or conversation.
PM
Or conversation. I'm sick of it. I think people, again, have to be accountable and you have to own them.
I'm gonna call you out on it. More of us need to stop thinking we've arrived because you got your PhD
or DNP or whatever that is, and use it to say, “I'm not gonna educate you. I'm gonna tell you that’s not it.
You don't get to touch my hair; you have to ask me. You don't have rights. They’re boundaries.” So,
when I hear people say, “But we should educate ‘em as parents,” that is bogus. In this country, 95% of
the media, the colleges, the records, whatever, markets are owned by white males. Now, you tell me how
we're gonna change. Even in a nursing profession, you're not. You’re not, and even if it's a white female
in there, she's so afraid to lose her status, she'll still listen to the white male. So, is it gonna get better?
Absolutely not. Not in our lifetime, and maybe not in the millennials’ generation. By Generation Z, it
will tap down. Why? You know why? ‘Cause every different race will be a hierarchy. These Z's are
gonna raise money, have money and service their communities. This is something that’s never been
done. It's just that I won't be here to see it.
CH
You mentioned that you have a master's in--
PM
Clinical counseling and education.
CH
You are also an entrepreneur, are you not?
PM 19:58
I am self-employed. I am an entrepreneur and, again, the rebel. The policies were not set up for me.
CH
Okay.
PM
Well, women of color. So, what am I gonna do about it? Take action. I'm gonna get all the education I
can and I'm gonna start my own, and that's exactly what I did. I started my own business. I went back to
school for my double master’s in 1999 and then I moved. I graduated in 2002. I started from my
basement six months later, because with becoming a therapist, even when you graduate, you still have to
wait four years post-graduate to get licensure.
CH
Wow.
8
afc2021009_002
PM
Oh yeah. It's more education than a doctor.
CH
Okay.
PM
So, you do three years of school and then four post before you could be licensure. Licensure means you
can now take insurance, third party payment. So, before I became licensure, tell me, who can afford
counseling out of your pocket?
CH
Nobody.
PM
So, like, I had clients and I charged $10 because I needed to get 3,200 hours--
CH
Of practice.
PM
Post-graduate to get licensure, under supervision, which I had to pay someone to supervise and to go
over my client cases to get licensure. But, I was convinced that Black folks and other groups will pray it
away, but it was deeper than that. Like I tell people, “God needed a massage and he got me to be a
therapist so he can get one” [both chuckle].
CH
What is the name of your practice and tell us about your practice?
PM
So, the name of my practice is Nylex Educational and Counseling Service Incorporated. Nylex because
those are my granddaughters’ names. I do education because I speak and counseling because I have a
private practice. So, my client base is from word of mouth only. I have a big practice; I have about 200
clients. I speak for most companies on not just mental health, civility, depression, burnout, self-care,
range of topics. I speak companies across United States. So, I've been doing that 20 years. I don't have a
website, and people go, “What do you mean, you don't have a website?” Well, I’m like a Bentley.
Bentley don't advertise. It’s word of mouth. I have an unconditional regard for what I do, I have passion,
but I think the universe and our world would be a better place if we get a checkup from the neck up,
because our brains are the engines that can and we don't relate. Because we can't see it, we don't treat it.
We walk around, nurses, ‘cause I'm a nurse first, but those behaviors we always look at physical, but my
practice allows me to look at a holistic approach with my clients. So, I want to know what meds you on
and what surgeries you had. My nursing background, again, it’s those skills. It makes me a really great
therapist, because you get someone with menopausal, they're gonna ask you those questions. You get a
guy that’s irritable, might have seasonal affect disorder or even erectile dysfunction. That's my nursing
that’s coming there because that's affecting his mental health, and if I can explain it to him in the
simplest terms from my nursing background, then I can get the mental health stuff done. If you're not
9
afc2021009_002
taking your meds, it's not because you're non-compliant. Everybody writes in your notes. I hate when
you write a patient is non-compliant. They are not non-compliant; they need more education. What else
is going on that I can't take my blood pressure medicine every day? But, if I get your checkup from the
neck up, your mental health, straight, you're gonna take your blood pressure medicine, your insulin.
You're gonna get that A1C from 11 to seven. You're gonna do those healthy things if you're healthy here.
So, it is truly a holistic approach.
CH
When you say, “Healthy here,” you mean in your mind?
PM
Healthy in your mind, your brain. Your brain is the engine that can, and we're taught that in nursing
school. In nursing school, back when I came along, you're probably getting it now, you're not taught
about the mental health. We're talking, you know, the frontal lobe. It's bigger than that.
CH
What else about your practice? What about your clientele?
PM 24:51
My clientele is from 13 to 100. It’s 13 to 100. I do a lot of gambling addiction because we have casinos
in our state, and so we're one of the states that pays for gambling addicts to get individual therapy for 20
sessions. So, I'm a part of that and I sit on the board of that, because, again, culturally, we play numbers.
It was our way of survival in the day, but now that our children have adopted that habit and it's led to an
addiction.
CH
When you said, “We,” you mean the African American?
PM
Yes, the African American, the Black, in the BIPOC community, ‘cause indigenous have huge gambling,
Asians have huge gambling, so we have to look at the-- Many things are culturally, you know, in a
population that looks similar to the BIPOC community, Black, indigenous, people of color, okay. That's
a broader term, especially today. I don't just treat Blacks, I treat all of ‘em, but I probably have even a
heavier percentage of whites, you know, and I say that because, number one, my white clients come to
me to guide them. Even if I think, “Oh, they're not gonna stay with me,” they don't leave. But I was
raised in two worlds. I'm learning about my Blackness. I was raised in whiteness.
CH
I understand.
PM
You understand?
CH
Mmmhmm.
10
afc2021009_002
PM
But, it's so nice that now, even though therapists, we are 2% of color, my population are now calling
healthcare and saying, “I want to talk to a Black therapist.” That's a transition, because you don't know
the journey. You don't know when I talk about Black pain. You don't know as a white, and you look at us
with three heads when we go, “X”. So, I've been encouraging, especially even my nurses who are
getting a higher degree, to get a psychiatric mental health nurse practitioner, because I want to send my
clients to you because they're looking for someone like me and that's gonna make the world a better
place. Same in Latinx, same in Asian population. We need more diverse therapists. So, my practice is
huge. At markets I speak, they know. I usually get three generations. I may have had the mother a long
time ago or the grandmother and now I may have the mother. Then, the mother gets older and I have the
daughter. I've been doing this for 20 years. So, it's so funny. Then, I have their kids because of the
unhealthiness of the family dynamics.
CH
So, a lot of mental health problems are familial?
PM
Oh yeah, very much familial. It is extremely important in the mental health field. You know, I don't want
you to go back to when you were a kid. I want to know about your family in the journey. So, if the
therapist tries to grasp all that on the first or second session, I'm going to get it anyway if you stay with
me, even if you stay with me three or four months. But there's a lineage, you know. How many suicides
in your family? Well, that's on your genogram. So, if there's a history here, and this one here is coming
back, you know, not just suicide, but it's like cancer in nursing. Who had cancer? But in our Black
population, we don't know what Uncle Joe had. As I use in my training, Crazy Uncle Joe was an
alcoholic because Crazy Uncle Joe the Alcoholic was depressed. Henry Ford saw that with his own
employees in 1930 and started the first employee assistance program because the men were coming to
work totally intoxicated and he had to figure out what was happening here. Well, it was depression. So, I
want you to now look back at Crazy Uncle Joe that you knew years ago. That's depression. It’s all
linked. It’s on that family link. Or a mother who was schizophrenic, or a mother who was all over the
place or OCD. Tell me about her planning. What was your fun days? You get that in the story, and I want
my clients to tell the story each week over what they come in with. First, I want to address, “So, what's
going on today?” you know, “What's happened since I seen you last?” and then you could pick up and
still pull from back here to bridge that story. But, it's like a tapestry, and you just go, “Wow,” you know,
“Wow.” I look at my women. My women sometimes come in depressed or bad relationships or the same
repeated, ugly relationship because somewhere in their journey, you never got a maternal validation.
Think about that. We look at our mothers or the woman in our life, the caregiver, is way set up in our
brain that they should give us what we need, but not all mothers are mothers because they didn't get
skills. They didn't get skills. So, I try to teach my clients to look for surrogates, because you still need
that: “You look good today. You did a good job. I'm so proud of you.” Imagine not being fed that.
CH
The nurturing.
PM
The nurturing, all your journey.
11
afc2021009_002
CH
In love.
PM
Love.
CH
Tangible love.
PM
From your mother or your caregiver or that person that you see as mother. So, when I see that, I can now
understand why all of this, those are the problems that come into place. Because I laugh at Hallmark
Cards. Hallmark Cards are the illusion. They're allusion to what white society tell us it should be, but
that's not what it is. When can you ever go into Hallmark and just go, “Happy Mother's Day”? It's got to
have some warm, fuzzy stuff and then so you feel oppressed because you don't get any of that. Like,
“What? I missed this?” Yeah, so now you come see me and now we gotta dissect it and what all that
means.
CH
So then, when you're going to get a card, you have to spend time to look at it to make sure it's the right
message.
PM
It's the right message, because most of the message until the last 15, 20 years was always some
kumbaya, you know, but all mothers aren't kumbaya, so it forced me to not get a card, to make a card, or
to lie. Something so simple, because [31:54] Mother’s Day card, and someone might just put on it,
“Happy Mother's Day”, ‘cause I already know the story, but I'm not gonna put, “Thank you for raising
me, loving me and being there for me.” You weren't there. So, we live in other people's expectations and
not our own and it's all an illusion.
CH
Then, you were saying a lot of the problems with families with mental health are learned. Do you feel
that when you decide you're gonna break the cycle in my family, that mental health counseling helps to
change the behavior, the mindset that will benefit future generations?
PM
Yes. It's not just learned. It could be genetics, it could be your neurotransmitters in your brain, but you
want to teach a healthy way to deal with it, to break it. But, please be very clear here, Carmen. If you
break a family chain, you could be isolated. There is a lot of resistance, because if I grew up with chaos
and you try to teach me order, it won't work for me. I can't be with you because that's not what I know.
That's not what I know. So, I have to start from the beginning and say, “Are you sure this is what you
want? You want counseling? You know there is a change that happens. You know that, you know, your
family may not be okay, ‘cause they gonna say, ‘Pray it away. Go to church. Why you tellin’ somebody
my business?’ especially in the Black culture. It’s gonna create havoc for you and I need you to think
about it.” So, when I look at that, yeah, I want you to change but with that process, you may need to give
up a lot. See, we think it's the Golden Rule: treat people like you want to be treated. That's bull. It’s treat
12
afc2021009_002
people how they're comfortable being treated. If I treat people like me, I'd be all over, you know, but
what's good for me is not good for you. So, to respect dignity and manners, that's a given, but people
aren't comfortable being treated well. That's not what they know. That's not what they grew up with. So,
you got to be very easy when you start to change mental health in a family because the family will shift.
You will have to adopt a new family sometimes and leave the old behind.
CH
Very interesting.
PM
Because think about it. You come in, and just say it’s you and your husband's an alcoholic, and you go,
“I want him to get counseling for us to stay married.” I have to say to you, “Okay, so you guys want me
to work with you so we can help with your alcoholism.” Then I have to say to you, “You realize the
person you brought in will not be the same person and probably might not even want to stay married to
you once they get healthy.” So, it's real, because 90% want a divorce and because the person had all the
control as long as I was drinking. Once I stop drinking and I realize I'm powerless and make amends and
do the healthy things, you can't control me anymore. We're not the same. You don't love me. No, I'm
different now. Now the rose-colored glass is off. I have clarity. That's what kind of happens. So, I'm
always cautious that people like hmm, because I know where it's gonna head, because you're gonna see
things different, because you're gonna read and you gonna be educated. It's not the way you thought, it's
the way it is. I'm just helping you see clear.
CH
So, there is a bigger cost to health, to wellness, than what the general population knows it to be.
PM
Yeah.
CH
That's really interesting. That's really, really interesting. In your mental health profession, have you, as
an African American female, faced prejudice in that profession, in your professional realm?
PM
I face biases.
CH
Okay.
PM
In my 20 years, I’ve probably had one client who walked out because of my color of my skin, in 20
years, but I knew that by the address. Not to stereotype it but, you know, if you're from someplace, I
kinda know your thinking. I had one in 20 years. I have, even today in this ugly, ugly climate we’re in, I
have people who are on the other side, way on the other side. It has nothing to do with counseling. It's
like I say to my clients, “If you want to deal with politics, this is therapy. Therapy is about you being
your best self. Your belief system is yours and I don't do that.” So, I make it very clear. I draw the line,
even when some try to draw me in. ‘Cause the assumption is, by me being Black, I voted for Obama or
13
afc2021009_002
I'm a Democrat. It’s none of their business. So, I just go, “That's your thinking and you're entitled to
your thoughts, but I'm entitled not to answer or respond. I'm a therapist and I'm here to help you have a
healthier mental well-being.”
CH
But we’re taught that in nursing anyway.
PM
That's right.
CH
That, “I'm not here for me. I’m here for you.”
PM
I'm here for you. But people don't say it. You even be taught it but you don't spread it.
CH
That's a disadvantage [chuckles].
PM
Yes.
CH
So, let's shift our conversation here now and talk about our beloved Chi Eta Phi Sorority Incorporated.
How long have you been a member of Chi Eta Phi Sorority Incorporated?
PM 38:23
20 years.
CH
Okay.
PM
20 years.
CH
Okay. I think we've come in at the same time. What region and chapter are you from?
PM
I'm in the Northeast region, Tau Eta chapter, Wilmington, Delaware.
CH
What offices have you held on the local, regional and national levels?
PM
Okay, local, I was nominating chair, member intake, and Basileus.
14
afc2021009_002
CH
Okay. The Basileus is…?
PM
The president.
CH
Okay.
PM
I was the president on the local level. On the regional level, I was the Assistant Regional Director.
CH
Okay.
PM
On the national level, I was a National Secretary, First Vice President, and then President of the
organization.
CH
The National President.
PM
Yes.
CH
And, incidentally, you’ve been a year now out of that position.
PM
Correct.
CH
So, you are our immediate past National President.
PM
Absolutely.
CH
Alright. So, thinking about the offices that you’ve held, tell me about some of your roles and some of the
duties that you were responsible for.
PM
I came in and I was immediately nominating chair to get involved, and I just learned the process of how
do you become an officer and who should be an officer, so I was still foggy about the organization and
that kind of was a blur, but I had a bigger vision. I'm a visionary by who I am for the chapter, so I came
in in March and I was president in June under the May elections. Yes, yes.
15
afc2021009_002
CH
You're a mover and a shaker.
PM
Yeah, because I don't waste time in just sitting around in any organization. So, I was president because I
saw that here you are professional nurses and that you give your time, your time, not be paid, not any of
that, to serve your community that you live in or those that have less, and I wanted to move us forward
in visibility to kind of let the whole state of Delaware know green and yellow, Chi Eta Phi, is here. So, I
met with our current governor in Delaware when he was [inaudible 40:49] congressman and senator. I
met with our current president of the United States, Joe Biden, that came to every event in our chapter.
CH
Wow!
PM
Our big event, yeah. Delaware’s small. We’re less than a million people. So, I wanted to let them see
you have women of color, Black women, Black women with degrees that are nurses. You may not see
‘em in the hospital, but we're here. So, I wanted to open that door up and so I started-- and I'm about
partnerships. So, I'm about partnerships and grants, that's my thing, ‘cause since we don't get paid, we
need to still get funds in, so I started partnering with the Health Department to-- “We’ll teach seniors
about diabetes education.” But I know you got that grant. How much will we get of your grant? What
your numbers need to be? We can get them. What do we get? Because for years, we gave away our
service. I’m not a slave. I'm educated and the minimum wage is $50 an hour. I'm not asking you to pay
us. I'm asking you to donate $1,000, say, to establish a fund or to donate to operate it so we can buy
jackets or hats and things for our community. We bought diabetic bracelets. One company bought us a
tablecloth, just little things that we don't need to tax our members with. So, that was my Basileus role,
and we got, like, five awards under my tenure in Delaware. Then, my assistant role was to bring
programs that would elevate your thinking.
CH
Now, that's your Assistant Regional Director role.
PM
Assistant Regional Director role. Again, remember you’re assistant. You do part of the program and then
the other part, you do the workshops to help broaden the minds of nurses. That was a great position
because my degree’s in education. I like teaching, but it allowed me to look outside of the scope of
getting people to come in pro bono, honorarium, to educate our members and to make the system that
we had in place streamlined for the members, you know, instead of we used to come in and have to sign
our name or pass the paper and it drove me yonkers ‘cause there's a better way. There’s a better way to
do it. There’s always a better way. We can always improve. Everything is a comma and you build on,
comma, build on, and so you kind of move that way. I was National Secretary. Not only was I National
Secretary, but my role in Chi Eta Phi at that time was National Secretary and Tamiochus.
CH
Tamiochus is…?
16
afc2021009_002
PM
The Tamiochus is the recording secretary, financial secretary, and we didn't have one in place. So, I not
only had to collect all the money, get all the money to the treasurer and take the notes and send out the
literature and develop the booklet to when things are due for the organization.
CH
That was a job.
PM
And make sure you got your stickers back on your car. That was me. It was a job. And give out the
certificates if we got new members or somebody lost one and making sure they're active. I am the only
past president that was National Secretary. Think about that: The national effective one have their hand
on the pulse of an organization. If you want to know what's going on, talk to the secretary, because she
has to be in every meeting with the president, she has to be in every meeting that--
CH
She or he.
PM
She or he. She, he, they. Today, it's all that transgender female, male, bi, you know, they all have to be.
CH
So, we say, “the member”.
PM
The members, so, “they”. They all have to have notes, legal notes. The National Secretary needs to be
there. So, give it a shot. If you're not good there, you could-- ‘cause you have to keep your records seven
years, you then put the organization at risk. So, and then I became First Vice President, and I loved that
because First Vice President is building partners, really going out and letting them see the face with the
face. We built partners. I think in the 21st administration, we had 14 new partners.
CH
Now, 21st is your administration?
PM
21st is my administration.
CH
Okay, when you were the National President.
PM
When I was the National President.
CH
Okay, 21st administration.
17
afc2021009_002
PM
21st administration, because it’s not about me as a team. We all did that. St. Jude, you were on the St.
Jude, which is still going strong. The members have loved it, bought into it, and we make it work. We
make it work.
CH
We're making it work.
PM
We’re making it work, you know, so those programs and partners is what elevate it.
CH
And also gave us more visibility.
PM
It's always about visibility. Under the first, I spoke at the Black Woman's Agenda. First, I think when I
spoke at-- President speaking at NCNW. Now, we've been an affiliate of NCNW since its inception.
CH
NCNW.
PM
National Congress of Negro Women. So, we were their third affiliate, back when they started with Mary
[inaudible 47:26].
CH
Chi Eta Phi was?
PM
Chi Eta Phi was.
CH
Third affiliate.
PM
Third affiliate. But, this was the first time they ever asked us to be on their podium to speak under the
21st administration.
CH
Congratulations.
PM
Thank you. Now, think about that. We donate, have our members join, but until you get visibility, until
you make those connections, you got to make connections, you have to be present, you must be visible
and you must use your voice, because just because you say it doesn't mean it is. There's another side.
Again, being a rebel, being that vocal, people listen to it. If I give you your own data, like, before you
18
afc2021009_002
even were, we were part of you, we believed in you, so you have to believe in us, ‘cause it's all bi-
directional. Everything is. It’s not, “I want something from you, you want something from me.” We want
to grow, but we want to grow as one. We got a great partnership, when I was Supreme, when I was the
National President, with the Red Cross. Huge, huge. Why? Because as your community is getting
rundown, we need to be there. Because if you believe that they're going to service people of color
communities the way they service white community, that's a myth. There's still that person at the top;
95% don't look like me. So, we got the partnership that now, when there's disasters in our own backyard,
we have nurses that look like the people we're servicing. That’s a long time coming, but it was done.
CH
So, presence is important.
PM
Presence is important. Because of the history, it’s so sad, of oppression and lack of trust, even though
you'd lost everything, even though you say, “I'm alive,” you still want to see somebody that look like
you.
CH
Who you may be able to relate to.
PM
Who I may.
CH
You may.
PM
We may not come from the same background but at least, Lord knows, I got a fighting chance. Lord
knows.
CH
Yeah, someone who may advocate for me.
PM
Yes, just one person.
CH
But we know because Chi Eta Phi is here that there will be advocates [chuckles].
PM
You call Chi Eta Phi, you got more than advocates. We will own it, fix it, call it dead to death, because
we're professional nurses.
CH
Yes, we are.
19
afc2021009_002
PM
You know, we have resources. We all don't have all the tools, but we know how to get the tools. This is
magnificent because there isn't a level of nursing we don't have, from diploma to PhD to DNP, from
mental health to nephrology, from nephrology to teacher to professor to tenure.
CH
To entrepreneurs.
PM
To entrepreneurs, and we have more nursing entrepreneurs in this than ever. We got nurses who got own
clinics. I'm here to mentor someone now who wants to open a business. She's a DNP. I've been talking to
her, helping her to start a business. I get conference calls where I set up and meet with future
entrepreneur nurses in Chi Eta Phi, and they pay my time to get them started on the tools they need to
start before you start a business, because we realize that we don't just have to be at the bedside. We
could be at the client's, patient’s side in any arena. Healthcare.
CH
And be at the board table, the boardroom.
PM
Any nurse, Chi Eta Phi, again, on the 21st administration, elevated Nurses on Board. I don't think we,
again, being nurses of color, believe we could sit on the board, but we have the skills. What do you
mean, we can’t sit on a board? So, with the Nursing on Board coalition that we're partnered with that
sends out board positions that are coming up, it’s up to them. We have many of our nurses, ‘cause the
goal was to have 10,000 nurses on a board by 2020. Well, we've made that, but the organization, they
made it because of Chi Eta Phi nurses, because we put the call out and we're on board. I'm on two boards
myself, you know. I talk boards. PTA is a board. I don't think people realize the significance of starting
at your local level and then state, but that's where the trouble starts. That's your backyard, you know.
Everything is about where you live, and being on those boards and then up to medical boards and
nursing boards and making those decisions. But, the trend is changing because many organizations today
are putting a nurse on board, and under what we are with this pandemic, everybody needs a nurse on
board.
CH
I agree. Well, I think we've talked a lot about the contributions and accomplishments that were
established during your tenure. Did we leave anything out as far as accomplishments? What direction do
you see the organization going in?
PM 53:00
I am hopeful. See, the organization, we have to, number one, eliminate cronyism. We have to. We have a
voting for officers by delegates. We have five regions and two regions are extremely heavy, and so it’s a
disservice to other regions. We need to eliminate delegates. Every member who pays dues have a right to
vote, and that's gonna be a by-law change that needs to be done next time. That's number one. Number
two, leadership, whoever they are, [inaudible 53:45], get there, you can't keep changing up. You build
on. You can't make it personal with an agenda. It's about the vision. So, instead of us going, “I like the
way she dress,” or, “I like the way she looks,” what's the vision? If you don't have a vision, if we don't
20
afc2021009_002
change some things, we won't be here in five years. We won't. You will be financially broke and you
will not be able to get money from members because we allowed, because not using our voice, it to
happen. We don't look at a budget. If we want to move forward as an organization, nurses must
understand the budget process. You couldn't have one year 500,000 and then two years later, you got
50,000. Why aren't we questioning? Why do we continue to look a deer in the headlights because we
don't want to hurt someone's feelings? This is a business. This is not a mom-and-pop operation, you
know. It'd be no different as you change your investment. So, we gotta look at fiduciary and
sustainability. The future should be grant getting. We are a 501(c)(3) nonprofit. We have a contract with
the government to apply for grants, but if you don't get the person that you're hired to do the job to do
the job, those are dollars that should come in. You cannot, you will not continue to exist being a
dues-paying only, because X amount of your dues go to operation, X go to scholarship, X go to the
house. What was left? How do you extend it? We're still operating. We had made some headway of
building us forward but we're at a pause. We're at a pause. So, because, again, we don't listen to the
budget and the finances and, you know, we don't pay attention. We want to pay attention to the music
and the beat and the jumping up and down and that has its place, but I don't want it to be in this meeting.
It doesn't. It just doesn't. We have to get more serious about what does it take to run a business, all of us
as nurses, ‘cause nurses, you know, we’re nurses. Many nurses don't manage their own money or are in
debt beyond their years. Well, we gotta start training. We started some of that in the 21st administration
but it has to be continued. So, I think going forward, we can't brand and change the brand ‘cause there's
a new administration. We always undo because we have an agenda, and that is going to be the loss of
this amazing organization. It will be if we don't stop it.
CH
We happen to right now be in Atlanta, Georgia at Chi Eta Phi’s biannual Leadership Conference, and
some of what you just mentioned is what they are discussing during this meeting. So, it's very important
for us to embrace the teaching as leaders, which is a part of our mission to develop a corps of nurse
leaders. We have to change our thinking.
PM
We have to change our thinking. It’s as simple as sitting at lunch. Someone said, “Well, I like the way
we've always done. I like the old ways. Old ways aren’t bad.” That means you take your old ways and
develop into customs, which is harmful in a new era. But people forget. You have a iPad, a cell phone,
so you've evolved, so why don't you take that same concept and evolve it in how do you grow your
business? How do you grow your business? We have a foundation. Why aren’t we communicating? The
conference is great. You're talking about communication but there's no communication. See, I'm a
person of your words-- I'm a therapist. Your words have to match your actions, so if you talk about
communication, why aren’t you talking about communication? Why don’t I know what's going on? Your
words don't match your actions, you see.
CH
They discussed it too in the communication lecture, that your words have to match your actions. But,
let's move on. So, since you have been out of office as the National President, what is your role now as
the immediate past National President?
21
afc2021009_002
PM
My role now-- I'm a straight shooter. I’m just there. My role should be, is to be a resource to the current
President, to say, to have an orientation of what was done under my tenure, to help her build or pause,
and there's been no communication.
CH
Okay. So, what words of wisdom do you have for a member who is desiring to seek an office in the
organization?
PM
To seek an office it should be here. You show up, you come to meetings, you go to regional conference,
you go shake hands, “Hi, my name is. I'm new,” and you start to network. You just jump in. I don't know
your experience. You got to tell me so we could put you where you're gonna love it. Because I'm a
person that when you come in, you should be takin’ off. You learn it, you're scared, but we should love
on you. We should love on you and extend the hand and bring you through. What's your desires?
Because when I came in in 2 oh 2, I [inaudible 1:00:07] in two oh three, and I said to the president then,
“How do I get where you are?”
CH
Well, I have a personal story about us that I always, always remember. It was at our first regional and I
believe it was in your state and, you know, I knew people from my chapter and, you know, I'm a pretty
outgoing person. It had to be God that you and I, out of all of that big sea of people in that big
auditorium, ended up together. We talked about, you know, that we had just come in the organization
and you said to me, “I want to run for regional office. Do you think I should do it?” and I said, “Yes, do
it,” and I just saw you take off like lightning from there. You know, that is one of my fondest memories
of you. And you really did it.
PM
Yeah, you see, but I had to get validation.
CH
[chuckles].
PM
Think about what I just said in counseling was full circle. I didn't have the confidence in my own self,
even though I can talk it. You just affirmed it.
CH
Wow.
PM
And you didn't even know that.
CH
I didn't know I was giving you that much impact.
22
afc2021009_002
PM
You did. You gave me that much confidence to move forward, because if you had’a said, “No,” I
probably would have just waited.
CH
No! I just saw something in you. I said, “Yes! Go for it.”
PM
Yeah, ‘cause I didn't know the rules of the game.
CH
Well, you went for it, and you were the Assistant Regional Director. I was like, “Wow!” Then, the next
thing I know, you were the National Secretary.
PM
And Assistant Regional Director and Tamiochus at the same time.
CH
Oh, yes. Yes, yes. Then, you were the National President. You go. So, that would be a word to a person
who is seeking office is you just go. You go for it. You learn.
PM
And call me. What do you need? If you have questions, if you're not sure, give me a call. Reach out.
CH
We are experiencing a historical and challenging time in healthcare, our society, and nursing in the face
of the pandemic, which is COVID-19. How has that impacted you and your professional practice?
PM 1:02:43
For me, it meant being flexible and resilient in my professional practice. It meant going into my office
every day knowing my clients needed to be in treatment and how do I keep them connected and stay
safe. So, I had to learn a new platform, literally in 48 hours.
CH
You had to be innovative.
PM
Had to be extremely innovative, get a new platform, and a platform that was HIPAA compliant, not a
Zoom, not those other things. That won't work for therapists. To be HIPAA compliant, and then how to
educate my clients to use it. So, I almost didn't miss a beat, literally. I think I worked more hours under
COVID, because I was coming out of this and I was probably working seven days, six and a half days a
week. When I had myself private COVID, down to three. But, there was a need, a greater good. It's
always about the greater good when you look at things. They say, “Why don’t you retire?” It's a greater
good. Look at mental health right now. We now have a three-digit suicide number, 9-8-8. It took COVID
to get that, because if you want me to dial 10 digits and I got somebody thinking about suicide, my
23
afc2021009_002
anxiety wouldn't let it, but we got a 9-8-8 out of COVID because the numbers have skyrocketed and
access, access, access.
CH
Three digits, you're talking about, like, to call on the phone, on the hotline?
PM
To call crisis, yeah. You call the crisis. So, you think somebody is committing suicide [inaudible
1:04:38], mental health period, instead of calling 9-1-1 in this culture and getting shot, you call 9-8-8,
because that's the mental health crisis [inaudible 1:04:47]. I don't need a copier. I need somebody to help
me deescalate this client. That's a shift. It’s huge, but it also opened the door for all those individuals
who never talked about their mental health. You have Simone and you have football players and this one
now all coming out, which kinda is a red carpet for everyone else in the world to say, “It's okay. It's okay
not to be okay," okay. What is COVID? The same for health, physical, under COVID. How do you do
your doctor's visit? Well, you had to still do it virtually, but if you got the vaccine-- Now, there's some
unfairness there too. So, my clients who are vaccinated can go into an office. Those of my clients who
choose not to be vaccinated struggle with no one wanting to see them, including me. “You can’t come to
my office. You're not vaccinated. You should continue to do telehealth.” It's not for them, it's for me. I'm
immunocompromised, and I explain that to my clients. I'm very open. I'm immunocompromised. I can't
take that risk right now. I don't know. There's so many unknowns. But, I could see you telehealth. But,
doctors and nurses are feeling the same way, you know. If you say you're not all the way up to par, some
of us, we have children at home. So, it's changed the healthcare a little bit, you know. It'd be, like, there
were times where you had AIDS, there were certain nurses who worked that population. Well, it’s going
to be the same way for those that are unvaccinated. They just gotta catch up and figure that out. But,
we’re all entitled to good access to health care and in this environment, even the CDC right now is
restructuring, okay, and it's about as antiquated as can be. But COVID, there's some good things. Helped
them look at this and go, “This is not good enough.” That's the difference.
CH
Do you have any words for novice nurses and persons who are considering nursing as their profession?
PM 1:07:19
Go for it. Listen, the minute somebody says, “I wanna be a nurse,” and I have a lot of clients that are
now in nursing school, I assist them. This is where you go, “Do you need online? Who to call?” Lord
knows I got Walden on-- I got all the schools on speed dial, because what is it you need to do? Let's get
it done so that you can be the-- I let them know about scholarships and monies available because, again,
we're aging and who's gonna take care of us? So, I want them to be nurses, because one, they're
self-sufficient and it changes your sense of self, I really do, but the barriers that sometimes come in. It’s
usually finances and the age, they have children. We gotta adapt that system that we have. Even my 25
year old may have a kid. We gotta fix the system so they can go to school. But, I'm always encouraging.
Oh my god. I’m always encouraging to nurses, and I always give my nursing card and say, if it's about
finances, when our scholarships are given out. Chi Eta Phi gives out scholarships to nursing students,
and I educate and I tell about the chapters that’s giving out money and the national and regional, so they
can at least link into that to afford their education. Absolutely. Go for it and let me help you along the
way.
24
afc2021009_002
CH
That portion that Chi Eta Phi is active in as far as giving scholarship is really big. It's really major,
because another one of our aims is to level the playing field of nursing and to help break down barriers
so that people can go ahead and get their nurse education.
PM
Well, you know we have a endowment at Tuskegee. We have an endowment at Tuskegee. We donated to
that years ago, $25,000, and the interest on it was up to $40,000 when COVID hit. Because when you do
an endowment in Chi Eta Phi’s name, we had to maintain 25,000, but under COVID, nurses were
financially devastated, so we took the 15,000 and provided for those nurses continue their care under
COVID. We gave at our Boule, our conference, our, you know, biannual conference, we gave out over
$100,000 in scholarships.
CH
That’s wonderful.
PM
We just have to help them. We got to simplify the tool so that they can apply. We can't set it up
systemically for them to fail across the board.
CH
Do you feel Chi Eta Phi makes a difference in service for humanity?
PM
Oh, god, yes, yeah, because we're out there doing it for passion. We got that service for humanity kinda
branded in our hearts, you know, to help those who need our help, help those who don't even know they
need our help but we’re there, you know, to give them a link in to someone who not only look like them
but know. We service over 500,000 people in a year. Just think about the St. Jude walk or diabetes
month, kidney month. You look at 102 chapters all doing something on kidney to their communities. It’s
phenomenal. It's phenomenal. That's the branding. That's the packaging of the numbers and the impact
we have. We are to be reckoned with, we just have to vocalize it because we touch so many.
CH
We do. Finally, what are your thoughts on our beloved Chi Eta Phi Sorority Incorporated, and any words
of wisdom towards our service for humanity?
PM
My thoughts are, I love Chi. It's a passion. I was like a lonely child searching for a sister because my
sister’s gone, and to see, oh, my god, to see for the first time women who look like me as a profession, it
was just awesome. It was just awesome. To do work for the community. And community, we all serve
different communities by virtue of where we live, so just think of all the spreading around we get to
because all of us are there. So, we do good and we will never lose sight of that foundation if we continue
the true mission. Take everything else out and you ask every person, “Why did you join? What was your
reason for joining?” and the person who really talks about service, not title, not resume, is my keeper,
period, because that person is going to come in and do the work and the work is never-ending. That's
Chi Eta Phi. That’s service. Can't get any better than that.

Absolutely.

Priscilla, I really thank you for doing this re-interview with me. We did have some technical challenges
with the first one. Speaking of a year, we had the first interview a year ago.
PM
Wow. Wow.
CH
In the same August, and so I really thank you, I appreciate you, and I hope that you will have an
enjoyable time here in Atlanta. Thank you again.

You're welcome.
