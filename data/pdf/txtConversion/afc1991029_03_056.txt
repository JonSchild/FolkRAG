This  tape  is  the  first  in  a  series  of  three  recorded  at  a
 
performance at St.  Bruno's Catholic Church in Van Buren, ME.
 This
 
concert,  which featured choirs from both Maine and New Brunswick,
 
was  one  of  a  series  of  events  held  as  part  of  a celebration
 
honoring the centennial of the arrival of the Good Shepherd Sisters
 
in Van Buren.
 
This  recording  was  made  on  a  Nagra  tape  recorder,
 using  a
 
Sennheiser microphone.
 I initially attempted to record in stereo,
 
but one of the channels  of  the recorder was not working,  so the
 
recording is monaural.
 
We arrived at the church after the concert had begun.
 The first
 
song on this tape features a solo by Annick Gagnon,  a young (12 or
 
13 year old)  woman from New Brunswick who is also a professional
 
performer of popular secular songs.
 
Following Ms.  Gagnon's performance,  there  is a bit of historical
 
narrative,  in both English and  French.
 This  is  followed by the
 
choir  from  St.  Thomas  Aquinas  Catholic Church  in Madawaska,  ME.
 
Next,  a choir from St. Leonard, New Brunswick, performs.
 The tape
 
finishes with more historical  narrative,  which  is  interrupted as
 
the tape ends.

The tape begins with a performance by the choir from Paroisse St-
Henri, New Brunswick.  This is followed by narrative describing the
 
Sacred  Heart  School,  which  was  established  by  the  sisters,  and
 
introduction of the sisters.
 The next performance is by the choir
 
of Assumption Parish,  Grand Falls,  New Brunswick.
 The tape ends
 
with a song by a choir from Drummond,  New Brunswick.

 See MAP-DW-R0Ol for more information.
 
This tape begins with the end of a song  (choir unknown).
 This is
 
followed by narrative in English and French.
 A speaker mentions
 
that  this  event
 (as  well  as  other  events  in  the  Centennial
 
celebration)  are  being  videotaped,  and  that  the  tapes  will  be
 
offered for sale.
 This is followed by the performance of the host
 
choir from St. Bruno's Catholic Church.  They sing a pair of songs,
 
finishing with "America the Beautiful."  The concert ends with all
 
the choirs singing together on two songs.
 The tape finishes with
 
closing remarks by the emcee.

Configuration:  r2
 
Site:  Multi-purpose building,  Madawaska,  ME
 
This tape is the first of four recorded at Les Violons d'Acadie,  a
 
concert/dance/jam  session  held  as  part  of  the  annual  Acadian
 
Festival in Madawaska, ME.
 The recording was done monaurally on a
 
Nagra reel-to-reel recorder using a Sennheiser microphone.  Initial
 
attempts  to  record  in  stereo  were  thwarted  by  a malfunctioning
 
channel on the Nagra.  This accounts for some of the irregularities
 
of the tape,  as I switched microphones from channel to channel in
 
an attempt to discern the problem.
 In addition,  the building in
 
which this event was held might best be described as a giant steel
 
quonset  hut,  which  compounded  the  difficulty  of  making  a high-
quality recording.
 
This tape begins with a performance on harmonica by Arcade Richard,
 
an Acadian musician and dancer who was born in New Brunswick but
 
currently resides in Massachusetts.
 Acadian fiddler Leo LeBlanc,
 
another  New  Brunswick  native  now  living  in  Massachusetts,  then
 
plays a tune to which Richard performs a traditional Acadian step-
dance.
 The next performer is local fiddler Roderique(?)  Pelletier
 
of  Madawaska.
 Bobby  Kelly,  a  fiddler  from  Allagash,  follows
 
Pelletier and plays two tunes.
 The tape ends with the performance
 
of two songs  (the second of which is interrupted by the end of the
 
tape)  by Jerry and the Wanderers,  a local band who are serving as
 
the house "backup" band for a number of the fiddlers.

This tape begins with the continuation of a song by Jerry and the
 
Wanderers  from the previous tape  (MAP-DW-R004).
 The rest of the
 
tape  consists  of  a mixture  of  songs  performed  by  Jerry  and  the
 
Wanderers and tunes performed by local  fiddlers.

 Almost all of the comments and  introductions between
 
songs are in French.
