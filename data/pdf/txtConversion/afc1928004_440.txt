The Original Inventor and Veteran Pioneer of Irish Epittoidai 
PANORADIA IN AMERICA. 
Entered according to Act of Congress in the year 1879, by Barry Carter, in tha 
office of the Librarian of Congress at Washington. 
To THE PUBLIC: 
The author of the following volume was born at sea, 
June, 1842, and before attaining his eleventh year left his home 
in the north of England. 
After crossing the " big pond" 
several times, landed in " the City of Brotherly Love" May, 
'59, and appeared at Long's Varieties; being the first to dance 
in clogs before an American audience, reports to the contrary 
notwithstanding. 
was led to compile the following volume from a 
feeling 
that has long predominated within me that a 
selection of the 
kind would receive a 
full share of public patronage. 
Selected 
with care, as regards their freedom from everything that would 
shock the taste of the most fastidious; and if this little collec-
tion is read with half the pleasure I 
took in its compilation 
the purpose of the undersigned will have been effected. 
Leaving the merits or demerits of my little book to the 
unbiased judgment of the people, 
I 
remain the public's faithful servant, 
(Barney, the Jarvey), with Prof. J. Illacevoy'e Great 
_ILIBERNICON. 
Written and sung by Barry Carter (" Barney The Jarvey"), 
with Prof. J. McEvoy's Great Ilibernicon. 
Of all th' plisures in th' world, this is the pet of pets, 
If ye'll only thry a 
pipe or two, ye'll soon forget ye'r dibts ; 
An' if ye've throuble on ye'r moind, to frit ye night an' day, 
Jusht take a 
pull upon th' pipe, ' twill drive it all away. 
Some like " Killickinck," an' others like " Perique," 
Th' " Rough an' Ridy," or " Lone Jack," too make -'em feel 
serene ; 
But I'm continted wid a 
shtub, whin I 
get through me grub, 
Swate contintment gives it flavor wid me little ould dudeen. 
Cumin. 
Me dudeen, Mavourneen ! Acushla Gramacree! 
I 
always like ye wid me, when at home or on a 
shpree. 
I 
wouldn't miss ye'r welkim ehrnell when drinkin' me potheen, 
Ye'r th' sowl o' comfort, so ye are, me little ould dudeen. 
Whin through me labors of th' day an' to me home I 
crape, 
I 
till me pipe wid ' baccie an' I 
skmoke mesilf to slape, 
It's a 
luxury that all injoy—from Castle to Cabeen, 
For th' joy of ivery Paddy's heart's, th' little ould dudeen ! 
False friends may prove untrue ! Me Colleen faithless, too, 
Pd niver mourn, nor frit at all, if I 
had only you! 
From thim that's fickle an' untrue me ment'ry soon I'd ween, 
With th' soothin' consolation of me little ould dudeen. 
CHORUS. 
Ye'r comfort, Mavourneen, you are me only joy, 
I 
wouldn't give ye's up at all, and couldn't if I'd try, 
Ye'r always so welkim whin drinkin' my potheeu— 
Sure I'd die if any thafe ' ud shtale me little ould dudeen.

I'm going to sing you of a 
darling beauty 
That I 
met one lovely day in early spring ; 
I 
was dreaming ' neath a 
tree in sylvan woodland, 
While the joyous birdies o'er my head did sing ; 
Trie laugh ine• waves of a 
prattling little brook 
Kiss'd the flowers upon its margin fair. 
She'd the sweetest face and eyes of laughing blue ! 
There's no beauty with my darling can compare! 
CHORUS. 
Her silvery laugh, is the sweetest ever heard. ( Break. 
She's fairer than an angel, yes, she is upon my word. ( Break). 
My heart and hand, yes, all the world 
To her I'd freely give 
Her face 
nd form have turned my brain! 
She's just to) sweet to live! ( Dance). 
The summer came, with all its sunny beauty, 
When we'd wander down each daisy-spangl'd dell, 
And listen to the tiny birdies singing, 
While lovieg words in whispers I 
would tell, 
To this dear one, the sweetest of the sweet, 
The daintiest— the fairest of the fair. 
With soft blue eyes, and little fairy feet, 
And the sunniest head of sheeny golden hair! 
°nouns—Her silvery laugh, etc. 
With rapturous ecstacy my heart is beating, 
For she soon will be my darling little wife 
Then I'll happy be— contented as the song birds, 
ith her, my fairest flower, all my life! 
The soft love light of her sweet and tender eyes ; 
Far brighter than the laughing stars that shine ! 
O'a, my heart with joy seems brimming o'er and o'er ; 
For soon my sweet will be forever mine 1

Oh hone I 
wurra strew, how hard is our lot! 
The landlord has turned us out of our cot; 
To us, in the world ' twas the plisintist spot, 
On the hillside beyant in the corner ! 
The roof was thatch'd over wid bright yellow straw, 
Th' walls were as white as the snow- flakes, agra! 
Oh, it was a 
swate ' deter a 
painter might draw 
From the boreen, bey-ant, in the cornerl 
And there, by the fire, my dear mother wouid knit, 
While close by her side my old father would sit ; 
What stories he'd tell when his dudeen was lit, 
And he smoked away there in the corner! 
When supper was over, the neighbors dropp'd in, 
And by the turf fire each roasted his shin, 
While the boys and the girls ne'er thought it a 
sin 
For to hug and to kiss in the corner! 
When " Jimmy the Piper" walked in on the floor, 
The young people all made a 
rush for the door, 
Dragging Jimmy along to the barn, and shure 
They put him up high in the corner ! 
Then at we wint, dear, with hearts light and gay 
And danced the night hours into the young day, 
'Till Jimmy got drunk and no longer could play, 
For he lay, pipes and all, in the corner!

In a 
sweet little cot by the wildwood, 
Lives Nora, the light of my dreams ; 
More beauteous, than golden-wing'd birdies, 
.1' 
Or flow'rets that margin the streams. 
Soft eyes, like the starlight of Summer, 
So tender and loving, so true! 
Fair tresses, as bright as the sunlight 
When kissing the sweet morning dew ! 
Ciloaus. 
Oh ! my sweet little flower of Old Erin, 
With bright eyes, and soft sheeny hair ; 
I 
love you, Acushla, Mavourneen, 
The beautiful darling you are. 
'Neath her smiles, sure I'm like one enchanted ! 
Or under a 
bright fairy spell ! 
The love and devotion I 
feel then, 
Is more than I'm able to tell. 
'Tis sweet to be held in such thraldom! 
To worship at such a 
fair shrine ! 
I'd be blesz;ed as the angels in heaven, 
If Nora, my darling, were mine. 
0! I'll love you through sorrow and sunshine; 
And pray for you morning and night; 
Should darkness e'er come to distress you, 
I'll pray for the blessing of light. 
Fairest flower of my beantiful Erin! 
Your dear eyes and bright winning smile. 
Are cheering as visions of dreamland, 
Sweet flower of my own native isle.

Some very good sayings I've heard in my time, 
And some I 
believe to be true ; 
The subject I'll mention to- night in my song, 
Is one that is well known to you; 
Should you meet a 
man that is down in the world, 
And assistance you can't give him any, 
Remember that many can always help one, 
Wnen one cannot always help many. 
CHORUS. 
Then give what you can to those in distress, 
Let it be a 
dime or a 
penny ; 
Remember, that many can always help one, 
When one cannot always help many. 
A man may be wealthy one end of the year, 
The next one be wretched and poor, 
He's struggled his hardest to keep himself up, 
But has sunk down to poverty's door; 
To such worthy men ' tis a 
terrible blow, 
So give it to those most in need, 
For you who've experienced poverty, know 
'Tis a 
very hard battle indeed. 
Then give what you can, etc. 
How often a 
trifle will save a 
man's life, 
When he is near dying of want, 
He tries to live honest all through his life- time, 
But finds in the end that he can't; 
At length he is tempted to steal or to starve, 
His rich ftiends they all pass him by, 
They heed not his wishes, they care not his wants, 
He's left like a 
dog there to die. 
Then give what you can, etc. 
I 
hope what I've mentioned to- night in my song, 
That nothing I've said out of place, 
A man may be poor, but still honest be, 
For poverty is no disgrace ; 
Then give what you can, with a 
generous heart, 
There's no knowing how soon things may turn; 
Just give him a 
chance to rise up in the worll, 
And your kindness he's sure to return. 
Then give what you can, etc. 
Just out!

SONG OF THE SEA.

Copies for Piano or Organ, 10 cts. 
Address, 
Carter & fieveningham, 1606 S. 9th 
Street, Philadelphia, Pa. 
The streamlets may sing and the birds trill their lay, 
Mid sylvan woodlands thro' the soft summer day; 
Nor streamlet nor bird, in their caroling glee, 
Can quell my heart's pain like the Song of the Sea, 
When softly murmuring in cadencies sweet, 
Or dreaming kissing the strand at my feet, 
One dear voice and mem'ry is wafted to me, 
So sadly, yet sweet, in thy weird melody. 
CHORUS. 
Thy mournful song haunts my every dream, 
Wherever I 
roam ever near me you seem; 
Thy wandering waves through the night sounding deep, 
Can sooth my sad sorrow and lull me to sleep. 
The beetling crags, by thy storm beaten shore, 
Are haunts dear to me when the wintry winds roar. 
Thy blue heaving billows with crest towering high, 
'Mid caverns re-echo my heart's weary sigh I 
In sweet isolation, there let me abide, 
With sad mem'ries borne o'er thy dirge sobbing tide ; 
And when my sad dream, fraught with sorrowful gloom, 
Is ended, lone sea! sing thy song o'er my tomb ! 
HELP A MAN UP WHEN HE'S DOWN. 
(MOTTO SONG.) 
By Barry Carter. 
Copies, words and music, for Piano or Or-
gan, 10 cents. 
Address, Carter & Heveningham, 1606 
S. 9th street, Philadelphia, Pa. 
How many there are in this cold world of ours, 
When fortune a 
poor mAn will crown, 
Press eagerly forward to joyously greet 
9 
The one who to riches hath flown ! 
But should fickle fortune strip him of his gold, 
He's lucky, indeed, if he'll find 
One friend in the lot, but l'm sure that he'll not 
For they'll scatter like chaff ' fore the wind. 
CHORUS. 
When a 
man's going down, it's the way of the world 
To give him a 
kick and a 
frown ! 
But, 01 how much better we feel, if we try 
To help a 
man up when he's down! 
This world is a 
hard one for poverty's sons 
And daughters, who often are led 
By hunger, to wander from honesty's path, 
To get them a 
morsel of bread 1 
Life is ever sweet to the low and forlorn, 
lino' oft' by starvation distressed; 
How little might save them, if given in time, 
By those with prosperity bless'd. 
CH0.—" When a 
man's going down," etc., etc, 
There's many a 
poor heart that is withering now, 
A smile or a 
kind word would save! 
Too feeble to struggle with poverty's sting 
Or battle adversity's wave ; 
Then stretch forth your band to the poor fallen wretch, 
Oft a 
trifle will fill them with bliss ; 
'Twill win you a 
crown—when life's sad dream is o'er, 
In a " land that is fairer " than this! 
0'o.—" When a 
man's going down," etc., etc. 
Then cling to this motto whatever you do, 
'Twill n'er be a 
clog to your wheel ; 
Nor think of the charity you would bestow, 
But misery and suffering ' twill heal! 
Whatever your mite, give it willing and free, 
And not with a 
cold, haughty frown! 
There is always a 
way, if you've only the will, 
To help a 
man up when he's down. 
Ono.—" When a 
rnan's going down," et.., etc.

Oh! weeping, bleeding Erin, loveliest Isle in all the sea ! 
Tho' wandering on an alien shore, my heart still flies to thee. 
Thy verdant hills and sunny streams, where oft I've roam'd in 
yore, 
In all their grand old beauty, I 
shall see, I 
fear, no more ! 
Soon may you be as free as in those happier days that were, 
May joy and sunshine glad each heart now tilled with dark de-
spair ! 
Thy slumbering harp re-echo that olden thrilling strain ! 
Thy emerald banner floating free o'er thy dear soil again 
CHORUS. 
Shout, shout, hurrah, for dear ould Erin I 
Crush'd may thy tyrants ever be; 
And driven from our Isle of song and story. 
Soon may we s€e ould Ireland free! 
God bless you! dear Columbia, may you be forever bless'd 1 
You warmly welcome to your shores, the weary and oppress'd ; 
You quickly sent your aid o'er to our famine- stricken land ! 
And when the clouds of war arose, you found us here on hand. 
With Maghier, Shields and Sheridan, may their memory ever 
live! 
We gave them all to help you, and we've plenty more to give ; 
Thy starry emblem blended with the green one brave boys bore! 
Soon may they flutter side by side, on bonnie Erin's shore 
Then rouse ye, patriot Irish hearts ! and swell the ranks again; 
And strike to free our bonnie Isle that lies across the main. 
Avenge the blood of brave true hearts, who fell in ninety-eight; 
And let the Saxon feel your steel, with bitter Irish hate 
From off thy soil that you should rule : swear! loyal Irish, 
swear! 
The Saxon sceptre shall be hurl'd from Erin's Isle, afar ! 
Yes, every tyrant ruler from our storied Isle we'll drag; 
Or die, as Irishman should die, still fighting for the flag!

Here you said you'd meet me, darling, 
Near the laughing woodland stream. 
CHORUS.— Hasten to your ivied arbor, 
Ere the stars bedeck the sky ; 
Long I 
may be absent, darling, 
Come, and kiss me sweet good-bye. 
Come, my darting, kiss your rover, 
With your sweetest heav'n-born 
Fraught with sunny dimpl'd gladness.

And her bird- like voice it thrills me with delight.

One lovely day in summer I 
strayed down by the river 
To cull the snowy lilies that near its margin bloomed, 
I 
there beheld a 
maiden of such seraphic beauty, 
14 
Of sense she near bereft me, I 
thought my fate was doomed; 
Beneath a 
tree reclining, I 
saw this girl divine, 
The moment I 
beheld her, I 
wished that she were mine. 
CHORUS. 
For, oh, she was the fairest of the fair, ( Break). 
Violet eyes and sheeny golden hair; 
(Break). 
Her smile it was the sweetest 
That ever I 
have seen, 
A 
darling royal beauty 
Is she, my woodland queen! 
I 
stood and azed enraptured upon her form so beauteous— 
Her face suffused with blushes, she raised her eyes to mine, 
Such eyes, so soft and tender, and fringed with golden lashes— 
I 
murmured lovely creature, my heart is wholly thine. 
I 
plucked the fairtst lily, with smile so soft and bland, 
I 
gave it to my charmer, who smiled and kissed her hand. 
Cno. 
For, oh, she was the fairest, etc. 
I 
taught her soon to love me, as time kept onward rolling, 
When her I 
asked to wed me, she answered with a 
kiss ; 
Our troth we quickly plighted and soon we were united. 
Since then the world seems dearer than one sweet dream of 
bliss, 
I 
love my darling dearer than all the world beside, 
And bless the day I 
met her down by the river side.

Sung with great success by 
Miss Teresa Maellvoy. 
In a 
little cabeen, down a 
shady boreen, 
In the beautiful county Galway; 
Faith, it's there I 
was born, one bright sunshiny morn; 
Sore troubles I've seen since that day I 
Oppression's hard heel, I 
was soon made to feel; 
From the dear laud, I 
love, I 
was driv, 
O'er the wild billow's crest, where the poor and oppressed, 
Find a 
home, where poor Paddy can live. 
Paddy's heart, like his door's, always open I'm sure, 
To the stranger, a 
friend or a 
foe ; 
Yes, his last bite, or sup, he will gladly give up ; 
All the world o'er, you'll find Paddy so. 
No braver, you'll find, though his heart's soft and kind ; 
No vile craven, or coward, is he ! 
For he'll fight till he'll die, with his last breath he'll cry : 
Bonnie Erin, Acushla Machree! 
Let us hope that the day isn't far, far away, 
When our sweet Emerald Isle, o'er the main, 
16 
May flourish once more, as in bright days of yore, 
In her glory and grandeur again I 
May heaven's sunny smiles, on thee, dearest of isles, 
Flood and bless thee, unfettered and free!

With a 
pretty head of sunny golden curls, 
Her tiny face is full of laughing dimples, 
In tact she is the queen of all the 
But her heart is oh ! so loving and so tender, 
She is just the one you cannot help but love; 
With eyes so soft as summer silver starlight, 
She's as beauteous as the angels up above. 
Cno—With step as light as a 
fairy queen, ( Symp.) 
The dearest ti:tle darling I 
ever have seen, ( Symp,)

love you, my own darling little Viva, 
With a 
love that can never, never die. 
Were you mine I'd be as happy as the angels 
Who dwell beyond the stars up in the sky. ( Dance.) 
We met by chance, ' twas in a 
little garden, 
A beauty spot where sunshine kii,s'd the flow'rs, 
Where the pretty birds make music all the summer ; 
As they carol ' mid those ivy shaded bowers. 
There she sat within a 
little rustic arbor, 
Like the queen of some. old fairy tale you've heard, 
I 
proffer'd her a 
bunch of purple violets, 
She thauk'd me with a 
kiss, this fairy bird.—Cno. 
Now my dainty little darling's quite accomplished, 
And her operatic warbliugs are divine; 
She plays the grand piano every evening,

Then her voice it blends in harmony with mine ; 
I 
have oft declared to Vivia my affection, 
And she days to me, dear one, I 
love but thee; 
My own darling little wife I 
soon shall make her 
Then this world will seem like Paradise to me. 
No.—With Vivia dear! my fairy queen, etc.

There's a 
bonnie green Isle away over the sea, 
'Where the boys and the girls are light-hearted an' free ; 
"Pis the land of the beautiful Shamrock, so green, 
And the prettiest country that iver was seen. 
But the Shamrock, by law, is forbidden to grow, 
By black- hearted tyrants, but soon with the foe, 
An army of patriots, determined,-you'll see, 
Who the tyrant will fight, till ould Ireland is free. 
Ah I 
the boys wont forget " ninety-eight"I am sure, 
When the widow and orphan were driven from the door, 
When " Emmett," the patriot, was strung on a 
tree, 
On that bonnie green Isle away over the sea. 
Soon may the day come, when each valley and glen 
Shall re-echo the war cry of true Irishmen ; 
Prom oppressors and tyrants may they ever be free, 
e 
On that bonnie green Isle away over the sea. 
THE LAMENT OF THE IRISH EMIGRANT. 
As sung by Barry Carter, in Character. 
I'm sitting on the stile, Mary, where we sat side by side, 
On a 
bright May morning, long ago, when first you were my 
bride; 
2 
The corn was springing iresh and green, and the lark sung loud 
and high, 
And the red was on your lip, Mary, and the love light in your 
eye. 
And the red was on your lip, Mary, and the love- light in your 
eye. 
'Tis but a 
step down yonder lane, the little church stands near, 
The church where we were wed, Mary, I 
see the spire from 
here; 
But the graveyard lies between, Mary, and my step might break 
your rest, 
For I've laid you, darling, clown to sleep, with your baby on 
your breast. 
For I've laid you, darling, down to sleep, with your baby on 
your breast. 
And ofttimes in these grand old woods, I'll 
sit and shut my 
eyes, 
Then my heart will wander back again, to the place where Mary 
lies ; 
Then I 
think I 
see the little stile, where we sat side by side, 
And the springing corn and the bright May morn, when first 
you were my bride. 
I'm bidding you a 
long farwell, my Mary, kind and true, 
But I 
won't forget you, darling, in the land I'm going to; 
They say there's bread and work for all, and the sun shines 
always there, 
But I 
won't forget Old Ireland, were it fifty times as fair. 
But I 
won't forget Old Ireland, were it fifty times as fair.

I've a 
nice little beau, I 
would have you know, 
Whom I 
met at a 
masquerade ball, 
He's a 
blonde, with blue eyes, and I 
love him so 
He's Apollo- like, stately and tall; 
We danc'd in the " Lanciers," the" Glide" and " Quadrille," 
My heart thrills with joy and delight! 
For he was the most graceful of dancers, 
Of all the gay throng, there, that night. 
CHORUS. 
He's tender and true I 
with eyes laughing blue, 
One sweet dream of bliss, seems my life at the thrall, 
Ecstaticly sweet, whenever I 
meet 
My darling I 
met at the ball. 
The young moon, in her splendor, was beaming, 
In the garden we stroll'd, he and I ; 
Where the sweet floral beauties were dreaming, 
And the golden stars laughed in the sky. 
His dear arm encircled my waist, by the streams, 
And vow'd by the bright stars above, 
That my smiles would wreath his life with sunny dreams, 
If bless'd with my own tender love. 
He's tender and true, etc. 
There's a 
dear little cot down a 
flow'ry dell, 
Ivy- clad, gem of all sylvan bowers; 
Cosy nest, for the birdie he loves so well ; 
Where, in future, we'll pass blissful hours. 
He says it's for me, his own treasure and pride, 
Whom he loves far dearer than life! 
There, together, down life's stream we'll gaily glide, 
When he calls me his own darling wife.

We have loved from our birth, and we'll love it ' till 
we die!

For it's there we left our darlings, 
When we kiss'd them both good . bye ; 
Ere we left them for the sweet land of Columbia, 
For to brave the wide and stormy main 
Prosperity has bless'd us both with plenty, 
And we're going back to Ireland again. 
CHORUS. 
To pretty Nell and Kitty they're our darlings! 
With their blue eyes, pearly teeth and bonnie gold-
en hair; 
Oh, they'll charm you, will those little Irish fairies, 
They're the belles of sweet Kildare. 
Sure they look like two sweet angels! 
And the music of their laughter, we're sure ye 
never heard. 
Their voices would soon entrance ye, 
When you've heard each fairy bird! 
For their eyes with joy and mirth are ever dancing I 
And their sunny hearts are free from guile; 
But soon in fond embrace we'll hold our daisies, 
For we're going back to lovely Erin's Isle. 
To pretty Nell and Katie, etc., etc.

Carter k

I 
will sing in my song, of the poor working man— 
In despair to the wall they've been driven ! 
By rich autocrats, who are boarding up gold ; 
That won't buy them a 
passport to heaven. 
I 
hear their wild cry sounding, sounding! 
Can justice be sleeping or dead? 
21 
God Pity the poor, with the wolf at the door, 
And their little ones crying for bread! 
'Tis the cry I ' tis the cry! 
Of the poor honest hard working man! 
Give the poor sons of toil a 
fair chance to exist; 
Pay him well for his labor, with stamps ; 
Work- houses, and jails, wont h 
tve three in a 
cell, 
Nor the country be swarming with tramps I 
The collier, mechanic, and poor railroad boys, 
Are a 
worthy, and brave- hearted band! 
No matter their politics, nation, or creed, 
They're the prop, and support of the land!

COMIC MEDLEY. 
WRITTEN BY BARRY CARTER. 
Sung by Miss Teresa MacEvoy with success. 
Air—" You and I." 
We sat by the river, you and I, 
In the sweet summer time long ago, 
So sweetly the waters glided by, 
Making music in its tranquil flow. 
We threw two leaflets—you 
Air—" Slcidmore Guards." 
Talk about your Mulligan Guards, 
But our gang can't be beat, 
The ladies shout when we turn out, 
0, ain't those fellows sweet ! 
With fife and drum we always come, to 
Air—" Patrick's Day Parade." 
Shout, hurrah ! for " Erin Go Braugh,' 
And the Yankee nation, stars and stripes, 
And Shamrocks bright arrayed. 
The ladies, fair, they do declare, 
Air—" Awfully Clever." 
And they say I'm so awfully clever, 
0, so clever! deuced clever I 
And they say that they never, no never, saw 
Air—" Letter in the Candle." 
A letter in the candle, it points direct to me, 
how the little spark is shining; from whom ever can it be ? 
It grows brighter still, and brighter, like a 
little sunny ray, 
And I 
dare to guess the writer, for it drives suspense away. 
Air—" Old Folks at Home." 
Down upon the Swanee River, far, far away, 
There's where my heart is turning ever, there's where 
Air—" log Cabin in the Lane." 
De chimuunys fallin' down de door am busted in, 
And de roof lets in de sunshine and de rain, 
And de only thing dats left me is dat little boy of mine, 
Air—" Our Boys." 
lie's one of our boys, he is, we're proud of our boys, we are, 
1They're honest and true, so give them their due, we're proud

DREAMS! 
Song and dance, written and composed by Barry Carter. Copies

Address, Carter Sr, Flev-
eningham, 1606 S. 9th St., Philadelphia, Pa. 
Embosom'd near a 
Sylvan grove, 
Just as the twilight fell, 
Within a 
cozy arbor, sat 
A pretty girl, named Nell. 
I 
qui ,•kly found she had combin'd 
(My lov'ly woodland queen,) 
More sweetness, style, and winning grace, 
Than all the girls I've seen. 
CHORUS. 
A blonde, and " sweet sixteen," 
And just as saucy as can be ( Symph.) 
She says, " I 
am her idol," 
And she's all the world to me ( Symph.) 
Her I 
love, for she's the darling of my fondest 
dreams; 
Yes, more than tongue can tell, 
This world a 
paradise now seems, 
With my charming, " Nobby Nell." 
I 
paid her flattering compliments, 
Then love commenced to make, 
And asked her " if she'd go next day 
A boating on the lake." 
While gliding o'er the featifry spray, 
She softly whispered when 
She'd be my wife; 0, then I 
was 
The happiest of all men. 
The summer pass'd, and winter came 
With silvery frost and snow, 
Behind the merry jingling bells 
A 
sleighing we would go. 
And Fass the hours in joyous mirth, 
On time's fleet golden wing; 
And now, she's mine, forevermore, 
That's why I 
gaily sing.

MacEvoy's Great Hibernicon. 
Ireland, my country, I 
adore thee! thy sons and daughters 
dearly love, 
And my heart's blood I'd give freely to see thy em'rald banner 
float above 
That saxon cross, whose hated thraldom long has held our soil 
with iron hand. 
Soon with the " avenging sword" we'll rally! and drive the 
saxon tyrant from our land! 
Cuottos. 
We'll strike for the Shamrock—the dear little Shamrock ! 
Our bonnie green banner; come, patriots, shout with me! 
Strike for the Shamrock! our own darling Shamrock 
The sprig of wild Erin— our banner--our banner we'll fight 
for till Ireland's free ! 
Oh, Irishmen ! Why is it ye tarry, ( fly quickly o'er the foamy 
crested wave! ) 
When kindred and friends, whom ye love dearly, cry for your 
friendly hand to save! 
The widow, the orphan, and the sire, who'r groaning ' neath the 
cruel tyrant's heel ! 
Now cry aloud for freeaom from oppression I Come let us face 
the foe with flashing steel ! 
And strike for the Shamrock I 
etc. 
Soon may each hill and dale re-echo with victory from brave 
hearts, tried and true! 
Our ould " Harp and Sunburst" proudly waving o'er the land 
where sleeps the brave Born !" 
Dry thy tears, oh weeping, bleeding Erin! 
Freedom's Star is 
gleaming in thy sky! 
Soon thy soil shall drink the blood of tyrants ; we'll free thee 
or like Irishmen we'll die 1 
We'll strike for the Shamrock ! etc. 
GOOD-BYE, NORA DEAR! 
As sung by Barry Carter, ( Barney the Jarvey,") with Prof J. 
MacEvoy's Great Hibernicon. ( Original version). 
0, here I 
am, an Irish boy, that's always fond of mirth ; 
I 
hope there's no one here, to- night, will slight me for my birth. 
I 
left the little colleen, in Dublin, far behind, 
Who says I 
am th' broth of a 
boy, but me true love must be 
blind! 
Cuoans. 
Good-bye, Nora dear! I'm goin' away from you, 
I'm goin' away to leave ye, but still 
will be throe ! 
Cheer up, me darlin', an' don't be so forlorn, 
The harvest time is comin' on, I'm off to shear the corn. 
Shure, whin I 
left ould Dublin, she was cryin' on the shore !

more she'll cry ! 
Her dainty little hand an' foot's th' natest iver seen, 
An' shure her aquil ye'll not find on Erin's Isle so green! 
She's purtier thin a

There's not a

So fond of sport as I. 
My dresses are in fashion cut, 
The sparks for to beguile ; 
They can't resist " Parisian airs," 
That's why they like my style!

Ho, for fun! is the song I 
gaily sing, 
I'm as free as a 
bird upon the wing 
A gay coquette and flirt I'm called, 
The gayest of the gay 1 ( Repeat.) 
I 
like to go to fancy balls, 
And join the festive dance; 
To captivate the fickle fops 
With my coquettish glance 1 
And beat ' em at their little games— 
I'm " number one" at that, 
I 
make 'em mind their " P's and Q's," 
And give them tit for tat. 
Although I'm call'd a 
gay coquette, 
I've got my share of tin; 
A gentle, loving, trusting heart, 
For the right man to win ! 
So l'11 be gay and festive still— 
Alive with dance and song; 
And fool the " spoons," for fun until 
The right man comes along.

The sweet bells of Shannon are pealing, Mavourneen. 
Their dear silvery tones float afar o'er the lea, 
And the low plashing waves of the beautiful river, 
Are kissing the shores where I'm waiting for thee. 
The lone stars are mirrored upon its bright bosom, 
While luna floods earth with her soft mystic light ; 
The wild flowers are sleeping, by streamlet and moorland, 
And the birdies, acushla, are singing good night. 
CHORUS. 
Come, Mollie ! for oh, don't I 
love you, Mavourneen 
I'm waiting, and watching for you all alone, 
To fold you again to my poor heart that's pining

E'n the stars, and the flowers, lose their beautiful charms, 
All joys are forgotten in my blissful rapture,

Back to days of long ago, 
Ere the blighting hand of sorrow 
Filled my heart with pain and woe. 
Then I 
meet and loved a 
maiden, 
With a 
voice of sily'ry sound, 
How I 
loy'd her, poor young darting, 
With bright floral garlands crown'd. 
CHORUS. 
Tho' we've parted, thy dear mem'ry 
Fills me with ecstatic thrill ; 
We have said farewell, for ever, 
Yet I 
fondly love thee still. 
I've the tiny tress you gave me, 
Near the strearolet down the glen ; 
Tho' estranged, and now a 
wanderer, 
Thou art dear to me as then. 
When life's fitful dream is over, 
Then my soul shall wing it's flight 
To yon sphere of starry splendor, 
Land of sweet immortal light. 
Cuo.—Tho' we've parted, etc.

S. 9th St., Philadelphia, Pa. 
Deep in sylvan woodland, near a 
tiny lake. 
When the Autumn days were drawing near, 
I 
beheld a 
maiden near its margin, fair, 
Singing in a 
voice so sweet and clear. 
Joyous, happy hearted, by the peb'ly shore, 
Her sunny face she turned to me, 
And, oh, it was the fairest that ever I 
have seen— 
More lovely than the Sunlight on the Sea. 
CHORUS. 
Her pretty flowing tresses—Oh they look'd so gay 
Entranced me l—Stote my heart away. 
I 
love her better than my life 1 
for she's all the world to 
me ; 
Her darling face is prettier than the Sunlight on the Sea. 
Balmy Summer breezes laughing through the trees, 
Near her home of moss and bonnie ferns, 
Wafted to mine ear, the soft and silvery strains 
Of her, for whom my heart forever yearns! 
Soon I 
ga.in'd a 
seat beside her girlish form, 
Although we n'er had met before, 
And we soon were making love ' neath the birdies merry 
song, 
The plashing waves were dancing on the shore. 
• 
I 
love her most to death, bless her darling sunny head; 
She often says she love 3 
me just as well ! 
Soon I'll wed my pet, and beside that silver lake, 
In a 
cosy little cottage soon we'll dwell. 
With the pretty pansies blooming around the door, 
I 
know she'l happy be, with me. 
With her winsome sunny face, and peerless starry eyes, 
She's lovely as the Sunlight on the Sea.

We're growing older, day by day, 
As time creeps slowly on, 
But will, you'll find us blithe and gay, 
As in tbe years that's gone. 
She—I 
love my home and warm fireside: 
He— I 
like my pipe and glass, 
And love thee as well, with thy silver hair, 
As when thou were a 
bonnie lass. 
CHORUS. 
We're as happy as two turtle doves, 
And ye'll travel for miles and miles, 
But you never will find such a 
jolly old pair, 
As Dolly and Darby Giles. 
34 
We envy neither great, nor grand, 
Though we be middling poor; 
Our little house, and patch of land, 
The wolf keeps from the door. 
We wouldn't change our humble lot, 
With any queen or king; 
We're merry as crickets the live long day, 
And from morning ' till night we sing. 
Ono.— We're as happy, etc. 
We'll leave an honest name behind, 
That's something proud to say, 
But, while we're here, we'll trr to cheer, 
And drive dull care away : 
In singing nightly, for you, friends, 
To win your cheerful smiles, 
And hear your ha ha's I 
and hearty applause, 
For old Dolly and Darby Giles.

DANNY DONAVAN. 
Written by Barry Carter (" Barney the Jarvey"), with Prof. J. 
MacEvoy's Great Hibernicon. 
Oh, my poor heart's broke to smithereens, 
For the thrifler who has left me; 
He got blind drunk and packed his trunk, 
Which near of since bereft me. 
I'll bate the blackguard blue and black, 
Vin a 
hoult av him I 
ketches; 
I'll whale the coat from off his back, 
For stayin' away so quick. 
CHORUS. 
His name was Dan, a 
Connaught man, 
Bad cess to thim vat toast him 
'Twas a 
sorry day he wint away, 
May the divil ketch an' roast him I 
35 
It's the truth I 
tell; with another girl 
Off to New York he sailed, 
Left fourteen chil der to maintain, 
'Twas thin I 
weep'd an' wailed. 
Wid six small chider in aieh hand. 
An' two upon aich knay, 
I 
wash and scrub for me bit o' grub, 
An' me thirty cints a 
day. 
SPOKES' .- Oh, Dan ! why did you come for to go for to skee-
dadle wid that dirty pot-wallaper? 
Oh, vvarra, warra I 
sure 
she was as ugly as the divil ( that he might forgive me for say-
ing so). 
The face of her look'd like the full moon in a 
Dutch 
alimanick. 
An' the mouth av her look'd like a 
patant rat trap 
struck by lightning. 
An' him, ( sings) 
His name was Dan, a 
Connaught man, 
If iver I 
tau ketch him, 
I'll make him sick for vat he's done, 
Bald-headed, sure, I'll snatch him.

As fair as the flowrets that bloom in the wildwood, 
Or pure snow Mlles that laugh in the suu, 
Is my blue-eyed colleen, whose voice is all music, 
Far sweeter than all fairy strearnlets that run. 
It thtill'd me with joy when she sang in twilight, 
The birds hushed their strains as it swelled through the 
vale; 
I 
loved e're we met by the flower margin'd streamlet, 
The dear fair-haired colleen, tweet rose of Kendale. 
CHORUS. 
Lonely I 
mourn for you, Kathleen, my colleen, 
Ever as o'er the side ocean I 
sail; 
• 
OR 
Only a 
smile would I 
ask from you, darling, 
To welcome me home, my sweet rose of Kendale. 
Tho' far I 
may roam in the land of the stranger, 
Alone and afar from you, Kathleen, asthore, 
I'll pray that the angels may watch o'er you, darling, 
And keep thee still pure, tho' we meet nevermore. 
Dear one, when I'm gone o'er the far distant prairie, 
I'll see thy sweet form love, so gentle and frail, 
In my dreams, for thy sweet face will haunt me in dream-
land, 
For darling, I 
love you, sweet rose of Kendale. 
Good bye! darling colleen, good bye, and God bless you, 
To Erin's green shore I 
may never return ; 
Farewell I 
and that sorrow may never distress you, 
But think of the poor heart that for you shall burn. 
I 
can't check the tears that will flow for you, darling, 
Nor still my heart's voice that for you oft will wail, 
But, ah, I 
will pray, and could die for you. Kathleen, 
Mavourneen, mavourneen, sweet rose of Kendale.

DANCE. 
THE MEN WE CAN NEVER FORGET. 
Written by Barry Carter. 
Ai.—" Things I 
don't like to See." 
A nice little ditty I'll sing for you now, 
And when you have heard it I 
know von will bow 
And declare, it's best Butte song you've heard yet; 
For I'll sing about men we can never forget. ( Sy m.) 
The first I 
will mention a 
brave son of Mary, 
Who's hobby is Long Branch, bull,pups and segars. 
He never went back on a 
relative yet, 
And he's one of those " men we can never forget." 
CHORUS. 
There are some who're forgotten as soon as they're gone, 
You can take it for granted his name will live on. 
He never went back on a 
relative yet, 
And he's one of those " men we can never forget." 
There was old Horace Greeley both gentle and kind,— 
A big rangle's going on for what he's left behind. 
Pettifoggers will filch every dollar—'you bet !" 
It's " a 
way they have got" that we cannot forget. ( Sym.) 
There were some who made fun of his old coat and hat— 
What he " knew 'bout farming ;" but one thing is fiat, 
38 
He was honest and true, and you'll all own it yet; 
He was one of those men we can never fcrget! 
CHORUS. 
There are some who're forgotten as soon as they're gone, 
But the name of good Greeley will ever live on 
He was honest and true, and you'll all own it yet; 
He was one of those " men we can never forget !" 
There was poor Jim Fisk, a 
good friend to poor folks, 
Shot down in his prime by the assassin called Stokes. 
I'll bet my last dime, if the jury act square, 
Mr. Stokes will " pass in his chcck," in the air ! 
Jim Fisk had his faults, big, litile and small, 
But his great deeds of charity covered them all. 
There are thous suds who mourn him with tears and regret— 
He was one of those men we can never forget! 
CHORUS. 
There are some who re forgotton as soon as ther're gone. 
But the name of James Fisk will ever live on ! 
Such good hearts as his now so seldom are met— 
He was one of those " men we can never forget !" 
THE BOYS OF KILKENNY. 
As Sung by Barry Carter, 
0, the boys of Kilkenny are brave roaring blai iS 
And if ever they meet with the nice little ma ds, 
They'll kiss them and coax them, and spend their money free. 
Of all the towns in Ireland, Kilkenny for me. 
In the town of Kilkenny there runs a 
clear strame, 
In the town of Kilkenny there lives a 
pretty dame, 
Her lips are like roses and her mouth much the same, 
Like a 
dish of fresh strawberries s.mother'd in crame. 
Her eyes are as black as Kilkenny's large coal, 
Which through my poor bosom have burned a 
large hole; 
Her mind, like i's river, is mild, clear, and pure, 
But her heart is more hard than its marble, I'm sure. 
39 
Kilkenny's a 
pretty town, and shines where it stands, 
And the more I 
think of it the more my heart warms ; 
If I 
was at Kilkenny, I 
should then be at home, 
For there I 
got sweethearts, but here I 
have none.

A purty song I'm goin' to sing, if you'll but listen unto me, 
I'm bound to make the welkin ring, kase I'm chock full of 
jollity ! 
Pat Casey was a 
solid man, an' very often tuck a

He won a " stake" at " forty-fives," and gev the boys and guns

CHORUS. 
"Swing yer partners," look out for the paint! 
Up to th' bar an' take a 
drop. 
'Twas fun to see them put on shtyle, 
Kickin' up th' divil at Casey's hop. 
One- eyed Clancy, he was there, wid rid nick- tie an' borrid 
coat, 
Sausage soap- fat on his hair, he grins just like a 
billy goat; 
Such shtyle as he put on that night was niver seen before or 
since, 
Th' ind of his nose was out of sight, like a 
Pinsilwany coal oil 
Prince. 
Cno.—" Swing yer partners," etc. 
Kate Fogherty was there, d'ye mind her face was awful full of 
brass ; 
She's knock-kneed, in one eye blind, an' the other one's made

Could bate Miss Katie, I'll be bound, at aitin' snuff an' drinkin'

Jane Delany, she got tight, and stole Kate Murphy's waterfall; 
The contints of th' house was bruck, vhin in th' policeman did

I'll go bail none o' thim got bail, who fought that night at 
Casey's hop.

TIM BRADY. 
WRITTEN BY BARRY CARTER. 
Air—".Jennie Jones." 
My name is Tim Brady, from ould Ballyshady, 
A beautiful spot on my dear native shore; 
It's wid true hospitality there they will treat you, 
Wid illegant whisky and praties galore. 
Sure the divil himself couldn't make them undaunted, 
For the boys are the bravest an' not prone to brag; 
They are true to the land that affords ' em protection, 
An' they'll never go back on the American flag. 
When famine was spreading in wide desolation, 
And blighting our homes in its sorrowful track ; 
When thousands were dying, on mountain and moorland, 
Those who should have aided us quick turn'd their back. 
'Twasn't so wid the kind hand of far off Columbia, 
Brighter records of gratitute show if you can, 
The " Irish Brigade" will be ftmous forever, 
With Corcoran, Magher, an' Phil Sheridan. 
Let this be our toast, boys, " Go I 
bless free Columbia," 
Where every poor wanderer can find him a 
home; 
Her arms are forever extended to welcome 
The poor and oppress'd from wherever they roam. 
May the day quickly come, too, when beautiful Erin, 
Mo,t, beauteous of green isles, bright gem of the sea, 
Stand alone as a 
nation, from tyranny sever'!, 
Like glorious Columbia, unfettered and free! 
Just Out !

To see the great Centennial Museum, 
My carpet sack I 
packed. one day, 
From equashtown to tli P'niPy, I 
started, 
Plenty of rocks to pay my way. 
I 
left on board the railroad keers--
But I 
walked back borne, chuck full of woe! 
They skin'd me out of my last red cent, 
At the big Centennial show. 
Fifty cents I 
paid, for to get inside, 
Cost ten donors, ' tore I 
got out I 
My new store boots got stuck in the sidewalk,— 
Didn't I 
cuss each darned galoot 
Inflated sandwiches, a 
quarter; 
You've got to plank it, or hungry go. 
I 
tackl'd peanuts, and hydrant water, 
At the big Centennial Show. 
Coffee color'd coons I 
saw from China, 
A long tail grown a 
top o' their head! 
Eating stewei rats, and talking G 
minor ; 
Breath that knocks a 
skunk stone dead! 
I 
saw some spoons, Ben Butler sent, 
Some whiskey Grant would'nt drink,— that so! 
A " Trading Post" that isn't worth a 
cent, 
At the big Centennial Show. 
Big mowing machines for cutting down grass ; 
Sick folks wheel'd about in big chairs; 
Real dollar store diamonds—made out of glass, 
Sold by sharpers at State fairs. 
Boss Tweed, Doc Landis, and Hamlet's Ghost; 
Pickpockets from every clime, I 
know. 
A grab game to see who could scoop the most, 
Was the big Centennial Show. 
New and Original Version by Barry Carter. 
They say this is a 
world of change I 
find it is no joke, 
But know you'll find no change in me because I'm always 
" 
broke !' 
Now lend your ears, for I 
am bent to crack and make a 
blow, 
Of things we've now, they did'nt have, one hundred years 
ago! 
They had no swindling lotteri?s, then, no wheat or " whiskey 
rings ;" 
Gold wouldn't save a 
murderer's neck ; you bet they had to 
swing. 
Judges, jury, detectives, and policeman, we all know, 
Are pia) ing a 
snap that would.i't work, one hundred years 
ago. 
Then, politicians who would steal, there wasn't room for 
doubt, 
That when " drop'd on" they'd get " the bounce," and soon 
get fired out ! 
But, now, unless they're soak'd in crime, to get rich stand no 
show, 
But Congressmen were white, and square, one hundred years 
ago. 
Our Country wasn't over- run with lazy tramps, in swarms! 
Nor he- male China washermen, who live on rats and worms! 
The workiag class were all well paid— and made a decent 
show, 
They didn't cut their wages down, one hun4red years ago! 
We want an honest, upright " Pres," on Uncle Sam's big 
ranch, 
Who wouldn't booze, and hang around all Summer at Long 
Branch; 
Who'd emulate great Washington, loved and revered so, 
By every one throughout the land, one hundred years ago.

MRS. O'LEARY'S COW. 
Written by Barry Carter. 
You've beard, I 
suppose, of Chicago's big fire, 
The biggest the world's iver known I 
How those who were rolling in millions of gold, 
Were so soon into poverty thrown. 
I 
suppose, too, you've heard, how some dirty blackguard, 
(Troth, I 
wish I'd a 
hould ov him now I) 
Said the cause of the fire, ( Oh, the dirty ould liar!) 
Was caused by my beautiful cow! 
CHORUS. 
That the divil may roast, the blackguard is me toast, 
For raisin' that hulabaloo ! 
Faith, his jacket I'll warm, for the hurt and the harm, 
That he done to me beautiful cow! 
Now it wasn't the cow, but some friends of my own, 
That came down to my house for a 
lark, 
What d'ye think, they do for a 
big oyster stew, 
But goes out to my barn after dark. 
My cows milk they stole, bad luck to the whole! 
Each dirty ould milk- stealing liar ; 
Sure the cow took the cramp, an' they dropped the lamp. 
Pon me soul, that's the cause o' the fire.

roaring boy from ould Killarny; 
The purty girls all call me " Bouncing Barney ;" 
Troth, I'm the boy to tip them all the " b:arney," 
Without an equal, too, in all the land! 
It was some years ago, I 
took the notion, 
47 
To take a 
trip across the briny ocean; 
To rouse the boys with patriot devotion, 
In freedom's cause for Erin, dear old land! 
CHORUS. 
I'm ever blythe an' gay, sing and dance the live-long day: 
The green in my caubeen I'm ever wearin' 
Though from my home afar; my heart is ever there, 
No place I've seen could ever ween my love for dear ould 
Erin: 
Sure our rollicking boys are all the quarest, 
An' our purty girls are all the fairest ; 
Our great O'Connell was the squarest; 
Don't I 
wish we only had his equal now! 
As an Orator, we niv'r bad a 
greater, 
Than brave Dan, ould Ireland's agitator ; 
His eloquence was rich, none iver swater, 
Eternal garlands deck his brow I 
It can't be done at all with street parading, 
Nor by those foul pointed rings degrading ! 
Nor by that boshy trash— Canadian raiding; 
They've tried so oftentimes before. 
But by Irish hands and hearts united, 
To right our wrong and sufferings unrequited, 
To free our land, us Irishmen must fight it, 
And strike the blow on' dear ould Erin's shore. 
Then let us strive my boys to do our duty, 
To right our wrong, and not for spoil or booty! 
Let us try and free our Emerald Isle of beauty, 
The prettiest little spot in all the world ! 
When blighting famine spread wide desolation! 
'Twas dear Columbia's aid that saved our nation. 
She'll help us, too, in our retaliation, 
'Till from our shore the tyrant shall be hurled ! 
YOU KNOW HOW IT IS YOURSELF. 
As by- words new are all the go, 
I 
think I'll try and sing 
About a 
new one that's come out, 
You'll say it's just the thing. 
As we all journey through life 
Each one will seek for pelf, 
But of course I 
need not tell you that, 
For " you know how it is yourself!" 
A 
rusty old bloke of sixty-five 
Runs after the maiden fair, 
He praises all her charms, and falls 
In love with golden hair. 
He makes her presen's by the score, 
And adores the little elf— 
SPOKEN — And all the time she has some other younger lover 
behind are door, waiting for the old cove to depart, so that he 
may step in and enjoy her society— 
Serio-Comic.

I've got a 
beau you all must know; 
A 
soldier, smart and gay 1 
I 
met hilt on the grand parade 
On last Saint Patrick's d 
His uniform was gay and bright; 
The ladies asked, with great delight, 
" 
Wh) is that handsome fellow, pray ?" 
While the band so sweetly played. 
0, wasn't it a 
glorious . ight; 
Mu.lie sweet, and banners bright! 
No soldier marched with step so light, 
In Mulcahy's Light Brigade. 
CHORUS. 
The men did shout, and the ladies cheer! 
The steeds were gaily prancing. ; 
As they marched upon the grand parade; 
'fwas there I 
saw my warrior bold, 
Oh, how my heart was dancing, 
Joyous and gull, tor my soldier lad 
In Mulcahy's Light Brigade. 
No other regiment in"town, 
Can make the same display 1 
No other band can equal their's, 
Oh, you should hear then) play 
They look so grand in uniform, 
And take the ladies hearts by storm! 
That's what folks said on every Land, 
As down the street they played. 
My heart is dancing, now, with joy, 
Soon I'll wed my soldier boy ; 
Who won my heart while on parade, 
In Mulcahy's Light Brigade. 
Cita—The men did shout, etc., etc. 
Sure, my name is Barney Bralligan, 
And here at your command, 
To sing a 
song in praise of home, 
And my own native land! 
I've sailed to foreign countries, 
And in many cities I've been, 
But my heart is still with Erin, 
Where the grass grows green. 
CHORUS. 
I 
love my native country, 
And I'm loyal to the Queen, 
Yet I 
can't forget Ould Erin, 
Where the grass grows green. 
Poor Pat is often painted 
With a 
ragged coat and hat; 
His heart and hospitality 
Has much to do with that. 
Let slanderers say what they will, 
They cannot c 
ill him mean; 
Sure a 
stranger's always welcome 
Where the grass grows green.—Cno. 
He's foolish, but not vicious, 
His faults I 
won't defend ; 
His purse to help the orphan, 
His 
to serve a 
friend. 
He'll give without a 
inurrnur— 
So, his follies try and screen ; 
For there's noble hearts in Erin, 
Where the grass grows green.— Ono 
'Tis true he has a 
weakness 
For a 
drop of something pure, 
But that's a 
slight devility 
That m-my more endure. 
He's fond of tun, he's witty, 
Though his wit ' tis not too keen; 
For there's feeling hearts in Erin, 
Where the grass grows green.—Cuo. 
There's not a 
true-born Irishman, 
Wherever he may be, 
But loves that little Emerald Isle 
That sparkles in the sea. 
May the sun of bright prosperity 
Shine peaceful and serene, 
And bring better days to Erin, 
Where the grass grows green.—Cno. 
COME SIT BY MY SIDE, LITTLE DARLINGa 
Come sit by my side, little darling, 
And lay your brown head on my breast, 
While the angels of twilight around us, 
Are siaging the flowers to rest. 
Your hands are as fair as the lilies 
That blossom in the shadows of green, 
And their touch has a 
magical power 
My heart from all sadness to wean. 
CHORUS. 
Come sit by my side, little darling, 
And lay your brown head on my breast, 
While the angels of twilight around us 
Are singing the flowers to rest. 
Come listen to me and I'll sing you a 
song, 
It's no very short, and it's not very long; 
But all about me, such a 
comical elf, 
Ah I 
sure you are laughing, so I'll laugh myself. 
CHORUS. 
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, fol de rol loll 
My nurse, poor old soul, she fed me with pies, 
My mother she taught me plenty of Beg, 
And my master, Old Pants, has taught me to thieve, 
So I'll cheat all I 
can, and laugh in my sleeve. 
Ha, hal etc. 
HER FRONT NAME IS HANNAR. 
Words by Barry Carter. 
The Music of this Song is published 
by J. E. Ditson & Co., 922 Chestnut St., Phila. 
The heart of my bosom has lately been stol'd, 
By a 
sweet blushing maiden just forty years old. 
She's a 
half Irish blond, and she likes pork and beans, 
Her feet are a 
feature, she wears seventeens. 
Cno.—Her front name is Hannar, 
Her father's a 
tanner, 
But him she does hammer in an artistic manner, 
She sings Star Spangled Banner and Aileen Alanner. 
With a 
tooth brush I 
fan her, 
When she thumps the pianer. 
Her more antique pull-back costs six cents a 
yard, 
Sacque, hat, gloves and parasol forty-six cents, 
She shall be a 
lady like Bridget O'Grady, 
For I've wealth, to get, and don't mind the expense.— 
[Cuo. 
Her mouth, well, it stretches from ear to ear, 
A better provision stora never was found, 
I've never kissed her, I'm afraid to go near, 
I'd surely fall in, then I 
know I'd be drown'd.—Cno,

THE COT WHERE I WAS BORN . 
I've roamed beneath a 
foreign sky, 
Where beauteous flowers grew, 
Where all was lovely to the eye, 
And dazzling to the view. 
I've seen them graced by night's pale tear, 
Bedecked by radiant morn ; 
But never found a 
spot so dear 
As that where I 
was born. 
Can wealth or title compensate 
The want of Friendship's glow ? 
Can gaudy pageants, ear hly state, 
So bright a 
gem bestow ; 
To me such joys are cold indeed— 
That hold the heart tor long; 
Give me the spot I 
love so dear— 
The cot where I 
was born. 
PRETTY PEGGY.

To my darling I 
will always prove true, 
And look on her with a

Like a 
sunbeam she's beautiful and bright, 
With eyes like the little stars above. 
Cuoaus.—She's the fairest in all oration, 
Pretty Peggy, charming creature, 
Pretty Peggy, darling loved one,— 
Ah ! she's like a 
little bird in the spring. 
When you're in her company for a 
while, 
Just look at her curly jet black hair! 
Her face is always brightened with a 
smile; 
Faith, none with my jewel can compare.—Cno. 
The day is coming when I'll wed this pearl, 
The thought of it cheers me on the way ; 
The bells will ring, and the colleens will sing, 
When she names the happy wedding day.—Cno.

How lovely seems this world of ours, 
With something sweet to love ; 
I've lately met rny fate in one 
As gentle as a 
dove. 
I 
met ner 5r:st, one Summer eve, 
The stars shone bright a,!id clear ; 
When music floa.ed on the wind 
In a 
park, not far from here. 
CHORUS. 
My Belle she's a 
beautiful blonde ! 
In style, others try to excel ; 
Yet, there's none is this laud can compare 
With my darling, my beautiful Belle! 
By some one we were introduced, 
Some good old friend of mine. 
Her dress was faultless to a 
hair, 
I 
thoug'It she was divine! 
So bewilderingly beautiful, 
This charmer fair did seem ; 
E'er since that night, this world to me 
Seems an enchanted dream 
I've loved her well, since first we met, 
She lovvs me just as well, 
And says I 
am divinely sweet 
My pretty blue-eyed Belle ! 
But soon we'll wed, and settle down, 
Yet, I 
must not tell that here ; 
It won't be far from the gay sea- shore, 
Where the dancing waves we'll hear.

I'VE GOT A DONKEY. 
Sung with great success by Barry Carter. 
AIR.—" Not Before Pa." 
I've got a 
donkey, he stands six feet high, 
I'll sell to the man who wishes to buy ; 
He dt inks seltzer water whenever he's dry, 
In a 
run on the turf, sure, he never proved shy; 
He makes good time, one mile a 
day, 
I'll match him against any stallion or bay; 
He fought for his country, been all through the war, 
I 
fed him on herrings, hay, rope and tar. 
CLIORIIS.—I got a 
donkey, 
He's not very chunkey, 
I'll trade for a 
monkey 
With any old flunkey; 
Wouldn't that be hunkey 
If he had my donkey, 
And I 
had his monkey, 
And donkey also ? 
When he's locked in his stable he makes a 
stiff kick, 
He wants to get out, he pretends he is sick; 
I 
call out my donkey, his name it is Dick, 
I 
coax him along with a 
hickory stick; 
If I 
leave in his box a 
big bale of hay, 
He'll eat it all up and leave none for next day; 
Last week he brooke loose, and of course went astray, 
He was found in a 
sewer in Avenue A.—Cuo. 
I 
harnessed him up last St. Patrick's day, 
I 
rode on his back so cheerful and gay; 
We started from the corner of Tenth and Broadway, 
We got to the hall without any delay ; 
Just as I 
was turning into the Park, 
Some one fired a 
pistol just for a 
lark; 
The donkey fell down, which caused a 
blockade, 
Only for fifty horse doctors he'd spoiled the parade.—Cuo.

MOLLIE DEAR, OR BARNEY'S COURTSHIP. 
Sung by Barney and Nora. 
The clouds have dispersed and the moon shines so clear, 
The face of the Heavens is bright now, my dear, 
My heart whispers true, there is joy yet for thee, 
So, Mollie dear, Mollie dear, come then with me 1 
CHORUS.—Come, come, come then with me! 
Mollie, Mollie, come then with me! 
Come, come, come then with me 
Mollie dear, Mollie dear, come then with me!

We've bound for Columbia, the lind of the free, 
So, Mollie dear, Mollie dear, come then with me 1 
I 
know your heart's sore to 1 
ave your own home, 
And over the wide waste of waters to roam, 
But with truest friends, darling, there we will be, 
So, Mollie dear, Mollie dear, come then with me.

Ould Father Maguire for these two hours has been, 
And I've got the ring, so Cushla Machree,

HOME RULE IN IRELAND. 
It's many years ago, in Ireland you must know, 
Since happiness looked down upon our land, 
Her song they were free and the stars of liberty 
Shone gloriously on every Irishman; 
But let us bar the door on the days that are no more, 
There's a 
light beaming on us from afar, 
If you'll listen I 
will tell you, do you see 
The sentiments of Pat of Mullingar. 
CHORUS. 
Hurrah for Erin's isle, her sons yon can't beguile, 
Because they know the wolf is at the door, 
Our flag may yet be seen aloft in College Green, 
And a 
home rule in Ireland ever more. 
57 
In England they may boast that our Parliament is lost, 
And tell us we should never complain, 
How can my heart be light, when I 
know that for this right 
My countrymen are rushing o'er the main; 
Old Gladstone he may rave, but our country for to save, 
These words they should be hear 1 
from shore to shore ; 
For O'Connell he did say before he passed away, 
A home rule for Ireland evermore. — OHO. 
There's one now in his grave, who strained hard to save 
Our country from oppression long ago ; 
Henry Grafton is his name, and may heaven be his gain, 
His energy for Ireland he did show. 
His voice he never gave our people to enslave, 
Nor drive them to a 
far distant shore, 
May the flowers ever wave upon our hero's grave. 
And a 
home rule for Ireland evermore. 
There's a 
laurel for the brow of the one who's striving now. 
To win our Legislature back again ; 
John Martin, ever bold, our misery to unfold, 
And Ireland for the Irish still m 
tintain ; 
But let us all unite to drink this toast to- night— 
May happiness revisit Erin's shore ; 
And the plan of Isaac Butt, from the palace to the hut 
Be a 
home rule for Ireland evermore.—CaO. 
I 
LEFT IRELAND AND MOTHER BECAUSE 
WE ARE POOR. 
As sung by Barry Carter. 
Farewell I 
dear Erin, I 
now must leave thee, 
With good heart I'll bear it if it's fates decree, 
With a 
burden of sorrow, an exile I 
roam, 
Through cruel misfortune I'm driven from home. 
My aged, lonely mother, I 
leave in despair, 
Who is helpless and feeble from sorrow and care, 
Hardship and trouble we long did endure, 
I 
left Ireland and mother because we are poor. 
To reflect on the past it occasions regret, 
The cas a 
of my childhood I 
ne'er can forget, 
The home that my f 
tther left mother and I, 
We must now abandon, and are turned out to die. 
Farewell I 
to your valleys, and moss- covered stream, 
Your mountains so lofty, and meadows so green, 
The place of my birth, darling, sweet Donaghraore, 
left Ireland and mother because we are poor. 
When leaving my mother, she grieved we should part, 
The sad sephration almost broke her heart ; • 
My blessing be with you, and prosperity attain, 
Is the wish of my mother you may ne'er see again. 
She filled with emotion, it pained her to speak, 
As the large pearly tears coursed down her pale cheek, 
-With a 
parting farewell at the old cottage door. 
I 
left Ireland and mother because we are poor. 
Words by Barry Carter. 
I 
am waiting alone by the stile, Nora Darling, 
The place where you've met me so often before, 
And whispered so sweetly, " I 
love you, my Barney ;" 
0, why do you come, love, to greet me no more ? 
Estranged from you life seems so bitter and lonely, 
Without your dear love, Nora Dolling, I'd die: 
I've wept for you oft since you left me in anger, 
Down here by the stile without kissing good bye. 
CHORUS. 
Forgive me and come back again to your Barney, 
The angels will bless you, avourneen achree 
Oh, dry those sad tears that forever are falling ; 
My Nora, my darling, oh, come back to me. 
Oh, have you forgotten your promise, mavourneen, 
You gave me the night when we met by the stream? 
With your head on my bosom you told me you loved me, 
Then earth like a 
heaven to me, darling, did seem; 
'Tis little I 
dreamed than of sorrow or sadness, 
Or felt in my heart that you'd break that fond vow; 
Another may win thee, but none in this wide world 
Can give you the love that I 
feel for you now.—CaO. 
The birds in the woodland sing sweetly as ever, 
The strearnlet is flowing as placid and bright; 
My heart is as true to you, losing and yearning, 
And weeps for you, darling, both morning and night, 
Perhaps when I'm gone, and the daisies bloom o'er me, 
You'll come in the twilight to weep o'er my grave, 
And mourn for the true heart that loved you so fondly— 
For one who'd have died, you, sweet darling, to save.—Cno.
