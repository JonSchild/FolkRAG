John:
 
Here's a few additions and possible corrections to the data
 
you sent.
 I have only dealt with the first six generations back,
 
and I have generally not covered material that would be in the
 
Lomax and Brown books.
 
Most of the entries should be self-explanatory;  occasionally
 
I have emphasized a change with asterisks.
 I can provide quite a
 
lot more information on the Cable and Hawes families:  dates and
 
places,  additional non-ancestral descendants and their families,
 
lines back in England,  etc.
 Let me know how far you want to go.
 
I am also enclosing a transcription of a letter from George
 
Washington Cable to his editor at Scribner's detailing the yellow
 
fever epidemic which took the life of his son in New Orleans in
 
1878.
 Pretty horrific reading...
 
I
 No additions for this generation  (although I might say that
 
*technically* Naomi was born in Brookline,  not Boston)
