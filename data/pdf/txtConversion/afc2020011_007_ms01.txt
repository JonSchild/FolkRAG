Project Detail 
This project is supported by the Archie Green Fellowship of the American Folklife Center at the 
Library of Congress. 
The purpose of the Immigrant Women Artists Oral History Project is to examine the occupational 
folklife of first-generation immigrant women artists living in Oklahoma and the networks of 
support that allow them to pursue their vocations in a 
new environment. This series of interviews 
examines not only the cultural and occupational traditions that these artists nurture in straddling 
multiple cultural identities, but also the translation of an artist's occupational life between 
multiple cultural and physical spaces. 
Legal Status 
Scholarly use of the recordings and transcripts of the interview with Cristiana Prado is 
unrestricted. The interview agreement was signed on April 10, 2021.

About Cristiana Prado ... 
Born and raised in Brazil, Cristiana Prado grew up with a 
love for nature and surrounded by 
artists. Her mother taught art (and at the age of eighty, was still teaching), and her father was an 
architect, whose drawings and designs inspired Cristiana to pursue architecture in college. She 
earned her bachelor's degree at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, and a 
few years later 
she moved to the United States to pursue further education and a 
career in art. She enrolled at the 
University of Tulsa and earned her BFA and MA 
in printmaking and an MFA in ceramics. As a 
full-time student who was teaching part-time and raising a 
child on her own, Cristiana used her 
art as a 
form of therapy, creating pieces that represented her emotions and struggles. After 
college, she began teaching at Tulsa Community College, the Gilcrease Museum, and TU. She 
was also offered opportunities to teach at Waterworks Art Studio and with Tulsa Public Schools. 
She is regularly invited to lead workshops and classes throughout Tulsa, and she strives to 
promote the art scene in her community and the state. 
Along with teaching, Cristiana utilizes every opportunity to make her own creations in ceramics 
sculpture, and watercolor. Elements of nature, especially flowers, leaves, and water, are 
prominent in her works, as are the African and South American cultures she grew up with in 
Brazil. Cristiana has participated in dozens of solo and group shows and exhibitions all over the 
US and Brazil, winning top awards in competitions, and she has been featured in a 
number of 
art-centered publications. In this interview, she shared details of her youth and of Brazil's rich 
cultures that continue to influence her art. She also described her academic and professional 
journeys, what it was like teaching remotely during the pandemic, and what she loves about 
teaching and making art.

This is Julie Pearson-Little Thunder with the Oklahoma Oral History 
Research Program at Oklahoma State University. Today is Saturday, April 
10, 2021, and this is a 
remote interview with Cristiana Prado for the 
Library cf Congress' OcciApational Folklffe Prcject funded by the Archie 
Green Fellowship. I'm in Tulsa, as you are, Cristiana, where you're 
currently teaching and doing your art. I'm looking forward to learning more 
about you and your work. Where were you born, and where did you spend 
your growing-iAp years? 
I 
was born in Salvador in the state of Bahia in Brazil. 
And growing-iAp years, as well? 
Growing up there, yes, and I 
moved to Tulsa twenty-two years ago. 
What was it like in your home city? What was the environment like? 
It is a 
coastal city, so being that close to the beach [was very pleasant and I 
had proximity] on a 
daily basis, pretty much. Very [nice] tropical weather, 
too. We 
just had two seasons: summer and rain. That's all. (Laughter) Very 
mild temperatures, very breezy, [very joyful], a 
very happy city, full of 
parties, a 
lot of celebrations, a 
lot of holidays. Also, we used to spend three 
months every year at our beach house. It was like, maybe, forty minutes 
from Salvador. Whenever the weather was good throughout the year, we 
used to go there, too. 
So what was your first exposure to art, however you might dc fine it? 
My 
first exposure to art was through my mom. My mom is an artist, and she 
was my drawing teacher in middle school. Besides that, she was always 
4 
painting. She was always creating, especially when we were at the beach 
house. She was always setting up her easel and painting from the porch 
because she could see the ocean right in front of her [and get lots of 
inspirations from that natural world]. I 
was raised in that kind of artistic 
environment. My dad's an architect. Somehow art was always around us, 
but I 
would say mostly from my mom. 
[00:02:33] 
Little Thunder 
You did get a 
degree in architecture from the [Federal University] in Rio de 
Janeiro. What drew you to study architecture? 
Prado 
I 
think I 
was trying to follow my dad's path because he is an architect, and 
also I 
was raised [seeing] him drawing, planning [houses] and talking about 
how to create that kind of house, that kind of landscape, and all that. I 
felt, 
like, compelled. [I 
wanted to learn a 
little bit about it], so I 
entered the 
Federal University of Bahia to start architecture. Then when I 
got married, [I 
had to move to different cities in Brazil due to my ex-husband's job. First 
city I 
moved to was Campinas, in Sao Paulo. Since I 
had not completed my 
degree in Salvador, I 
had to I 
transfer my course to the Catholic University 
of Sao Paulo.] I 
lived there for just two years, and those two years were not 
enough for me to finish the degree. Then we had to move to Rio de Janeiro. 
That's where I 
finally graduated. Pretty much, I 
attended three different 
universities in order to finish the degree. 
Little Thunder 
Wow. 
Prado 
I 
ended up getting my degree from the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. 
Little Thunder 
And you came to the United States one time hE fore you came to stay here 
permanently. What was that like? 
Prado 
[00:04:40] 
Yeah, my ex-husband came to have his PhD at the University of Tulsa. In 
fact, we [first lived] in Texas in College Station. He was supposed to have 
his PhD at Texas A&M 
University, but something happened there with his 
advisor. He retired, [another possible professor to be his advisor died 
suddenly, so the university had no interest in hiring somebody new to advise 
my ex-husband on something very specific as part of his PhD thesis. 
Knowing that there were quite a 
few other employees from Petrobras here in 
Tulsa pursuing their PhD, he decided to move to Tulsa to continue his 
studies at the University of Tulsa.] That's how we ended up living here the 
first time.

Little Thunder 
Prado 
So Petrobras was the name cf the company, the oil company, that he worked 
for. After your first stint here when you were still, I'm sure, not quite as 
fluent as you are, you went ahead and earned a 
teaching certfication in 
English. 
Yeah, when I 
moved to Tulsa the first time, I 
felt like, "Oh, this is a 
very 
good opportunity for me to learn the language." I 
had recently graduated in 
architecture, however, I 
said to myself, "I'm going to give it a 
break for a 
while, and then learn English, since I'm living here." [ Since there was a 
lot 
of exposure to the American language and culture, I 
thought, "It was the 
best opportunity of my life ever.] I 
don't know if I 
will be back here one day 
again." So I 
did everything I 
could to learn English here. When my ex 
finished his PhD, we went back to Brazil. There, I 
felt like, "I 
don't want to 
lose [my English]." In fact, I 
was more inclined to teach English instead of 
looking for something with the architecture. [With that in mind], I 
entered 
an educational school called "Institute Brazil-United States" [Instituto 
Brasil-Estados Unidos] where they offered a 
program to prepare students to 
teach English. Then, I 
got certified from this institute, and I 
started teaching 
English in Brazil. 
So you kind cf got the teaching bug? 
Yeah. 
So this second time, you've already had some exposure to Tulsa. What are 
your thoughts when you come back the second time? 
Oh, when I 
left Tulsa for the first time, I 
thought that I 
would never be back 
[to visit the city maybe just to visit friends one day]. I 
made very good 
friends here, and then they were still here. Then [four years later a 
job] 
opportunity came to my ex-husband. And here I 
am. In fact, [I 
felt to myself 
that it was a 
good opportunity] in a 
way because I 
already knew the city, 
although it had changed so much. It was good to be back here, and then, I 
have my [good friends close to me again]. [Tulsa is] my city now. 
And you decided to start studying art. 
Yes, [when I 
came here I 
wanted to use some of the benefits from the 
University of Tulsa through my ex-husband's job as a 
professor]. In fact, I 
looked for something in architecture, but I 
couldn't find anything that really 
interested me. Then when I 
saw that there was an art program at TU, I 
thought, "I'm gonna go ahead and start something [with arts]." I 
always 
liked the artistic side of architecture. I 
entered the university as a 
non-
seeking degree student [initially]. The director at that time told me, "Go 
6 
ahead and try a 
few studio classes and see what you're going to do." That's 
what happened. 
Little Thunder 
Prado 
Little Thunder 
Prado 
[00:09:07] 
Little Thunder 
Prado 
Little Thunder 
So I 
understand you started out kind cf in painting or printmaking... 
Printmaking, yes. 
... and 
fell in love with ceramics. 
Yeah, in fact, what happened is that, [printmaking was one of the] first 
studio classes I 
took at TU. [I 
liked it and thought that I 
should continue 
with that. I 
was able to transfer quite a 
few of the credits from my 
architecture degree to the University of Tulsa.] Teresa [Valero] was the 
director at that time, and she told me, "Why don't you just take a 
few more 
classes and get your BFA?" I 
said, "Okay, that's a 
good idea." That's what I 
did. [After I 
completed the BFA, I 
had some interest in getting ... the study of 
printmaking more extensively, so I 
entered the graduate program, and I 
got 
an MA 
in printmaking.] When I 
was about to finish my MA, (I 
think it was 
the [last year]) I 
took ceramics class, and I 
fell in love with it. Then I 
remember talking to Teresa. I 
said, "Teresa, I 
probably want to switch to 
ceramics." She said, "Cristiana, you're more than halfway with your MA 
in 
printmaking, go ahead finish it and come back later for an MFA 
in 
ceramics." I 
thought, "What a 
good idea." [It was exactly what happened.] 
Teresa, hersef, is an immigrant woman artist. She's part cf this collection. 
What did her mentorship mean to you? 
Yes, Teresa is. First of all, it was something very interesting because we 
were pretty much the only, I 
would say, [immigrant people in the 
department during that time]. [I 
felt I 
could have a 
lot of support from 
someone who would understand a 
lot of things that we pass through as 
immigrants.] She is from South America, as well, Venezuela, which is a 
country very close to Brazil. I 
had her as someone that was really guiding 
me professionally, and then we became friends. She was very supportive. 
She gave me a 
lot of emotional support when I 
was divorcing. She was a 
dear friend. She is still. Professionally speaking, also, she gave me very 
good advice. You know, we talked a 
lot about [what I 
should do next 
academically. She always believed in my work, in myself, and she always 
pushed me to [succeed]. I 
really appreciate her help. 
Right, right. So yes, I 
mean you haven't made it all the way through 
schooling, I 
understand, when you get your divorce. How did you handle 
that, and how did the art help you? 
7 
[00:10:40] 
Prado 
[00:13:19] 
It was a 
very hard moment in my life [because coming to the US was a 
choice]. [It was nothing like as if my ex-husband's job made him transfer, or 
something like this. He chose to leave Brazil by applying to a 
position at the 
University of Tulsa. He left Petrobras when he was selected for the position 
at TU. We had so many plans for this new life.]It is going to be a 
much 
better life, we're going to have a 
kid, which I 
had waited a 
long time and do 
lots of other things. Then I 
felt like, "Now we will be in a 
country where 
we're going to have much better quality of life." Then we moved, we 
traveled a 
lot, and I 
had my son. After a 
few years, things were not doing 
well in our marriage.] We were not happy at all, but divorce was nothing 
that I 
expected to be like so soon. I 
thought that we could work things out, 
[mainly because our son was still five years old]. [However, he decided to 
proceed with the divorce. By the way, it was a 
shock for me. I 
asked myself 
many times, "What I 
am going to do now without my family and with all 
these dreams that I 
had in mind."] I 
didn't expect to move to this country 
after leaving everything behind (I 
had a 
job in Brazil) to be by myself, to be 
a 
single mother here. 
I 
had the benefits from his job, so I 
was able to do everything I 
wanted at 
TU for free. When I 
finished my MA, I 
told him, "Let's wait a 
little bit at 
least, to sign the divorce because I 
still want to use the benefits from TU to 
pursue an MFA." He said "What for? What do you need an MFA?" I 
said, 
"Hey, did I 
ask you when you came to the United States for your PhD, 
[why]? I 
just came with you." Anyway, there was nothing that made him 
wait a 
little bit. Other things came up... [ugly things]. [In order to have my 
tuition waived to pursue the MFA I 
had to get a 
position as a 
TA. However, 
at that time, there was no position for me. I 
talked to my future advisor, and 
she said, "Okay, but we have to wait. As soon as there is a 
position, we're 
going to have you as the first on the list." So that's what I 
did but I 
had wait 
for two years. In the meantime, I 
did not leave TU because they were 
offering continuing education classes, and I 
took some in ceramics.] 
[Later, I 
talked to my ex about helping me pay for at least one class. I 
think 
he felt a 
little bit guilty, and finally paid for that. (Laughter) That class was 
counted towards my MFA 
later. After two years, my advisor notified me 
that the TA position was open, that's when I 
started the MFA.] It was a 
challenge for me because I 
had to be a 
full-time student, I 
was working as a 
TA for twenty hours weekly, and I 
was a 
single mother. [On a 
positive note, 
that new life gave me an opportunity to be a 
very strong person. I 
found 
strength in my art and in myself as I 
never imagined I 
could. I 
told myself, 
"I'm going to finish this MFA and in the end will be very proud of myself." 
Then I 
did. Actually, my art was (has been) very therapeutic. Everything I 
8 
was creating had so many emotions involved. Every single piece I 
created 
had a 
story to tell. Then every time, I 
was making my pieces by adding 
texture, imprinting texture, carving, scratching, I 
was able to release a 
lot of 
energy. My 
pieces, if they could say something, if they could speak, they 
would be revealing deep emotions of my 
life.] 
Little Thunder 
Well, what attracted you to ceramics initially, and how has your approach 
to it kind cf evolved? 
Prado 
[00:16:02] 
In fact, when I 
took the class, I 
felt [like it was exactly] what I 
was looking 
for. I 
loved printmaking, but there was something else about it that I 
was not 
completely happy with. There was in my mind, a 
kind of medium that I 
was 
still looking for. When I 
touched clay, (it started with ceramics) I 
found so 
many possibilities [and I 
felt much more connected with nature]. 
Printmaking is more structured and it's not as forgiving as clay. I 
felt that 
with clay I 
could [do a 
lot more, due its flexibility] and possibilities. I 
fell in 
love [with it instantly]. [Besides that, I 
wanted to see my work in another 
dimension because with printmaking, everything that I 
had done was pretty 
much 2-D. I 
felt that with clay, I 
could explore another dimension. In fact, 
when I 
started with clay, I 
initially did tile making and I 
used my prints as 
references.] It was very interesting to see those flat images into a 
three-
dimensional approach and having actual texture. That's what I 
found [in 
clay: actual texture]. The more I 
was studying and making ceramics, the 
more I 
was finding possibilities. Pretty much everything I 
wanted to create 
[in my artistic world, I 
could do, and I 
can do, with clay. I 
love it, and then, 
the building of the pieces, the application of colors, glazing, and all the 
process, I 
just love everything about it.] 
Little Thunder 
So what are some cf the influences that you draw iApon consciously in your 
work? 
Prado 
I 
have a 
lot of influences from my mom and a 
lot of inspirations from my 
culture. I 
would say that from my mom I 
have a 
lot of [inspirations on] the 
way I 
color my 
pieces. [Besides working with art restoration, my mom 
paints watercolor. I 
always got fascinated by the way she watercolors, like 
randomly just looking for blends of colors. I 
felt like, "I 
could do that with 
glazes." That's how I 
glaze my clay pieces.] I 
don't look for any kind of 
recipes. I 
know what I'm going to use. I 
know the colors, but I 
don't know 
[the amount of glazes]. [I 
keep adding them, also in between firings until I 
am happy with the result. Whenever I 
create different colors that I'm happy 
with, I'm not able to duplicate them because they are just random blending. 
That's pretty much the best influence that I 
got from my mom. By the way, I 
watercolor, too. I 
like watercolor for its possibilities of blending colors and 
creating new ones. Besides that inspiration from my mom, I 
have other 
9 
inspirations. They are my memories from Brazil. All my art work has a 
lot 
of texture, even my prints with simulated texture. The texture comes from 
my deep connection with nature, especially the ocean. I 
used to spend long 
summer vacations right in front of the ocean at our beach house: fishing, 
boating, collecting seashells, playing with the sand, walking on it, etc. I 
was 
surrounded by natural texture.] 
I 
had such a 
wonderful time as a 
kid with my friends and my family at our 
beach house. [My memories are just of happy summer vacations. Besides 
those memorable influences, there is a 
lot also, from the African culture that 
is significantly present in my home city. My home city is the oldest one in 
Brazil, and it got a 
lot of influence from the Africans that came mostly from 
the Yoruba nation in Africa as part of the slave trade. By the time that the 
city was growing, they had the need of some kind of extra work force. That 
is when the slave trade started in Salvador.] Today my city has pretty much 
eighty percent of the population of either black or mulattos, a 
mix of white 
and black. [The African culture has shaped my city with their cuisine, 
music, some of the city geography, and so on. Moreover, they brought their 
African religion, too. I 
was raised Catholic, but we always were aware that 
there was the African religion. The African religion was secluded, and far 
from us because of its mysterious beliefs. My family and my friends shared 
the same principles of respecting the religion, but accepting that it was not 
part of our lives.] 
[00:19:23] 
[We knew that the African religion existed, and to be honest, I 
had some 
curiosity over its "mystery".] As a 
kid at the beach house on a 
New Year's 
Day, I 
witnessed one of their rituals. I 
was still [a 
small kid, and that ritual] 
impressed me a 
lot. [I 
did not feel scared, on the contrary I 
thought to 
myself], "I 
want to learn about it. I 
want to know what's going on there. 
Why are all these things a 
going on? Why 
is there this possession?" [Later I 
started to understand that there are very sensitive people able to be spiritual 
mediums. During those rituals, these people are possessed by deities, gods, 
and stuff like that. I 
got very impressed by what I 
saw that day. My curiosity 
over that religion started growing since that seeing. Years later, when I 
came 
to the United States, the feelings of being homesick made me very nostalgic. 
I 
decided to study my culture more deeply and that included the African 
religion. Then, on one of my trips back to Brazil, I 
attended one of the 
rituals.] It was very fascinating. [I 
think that my work has been inspired 
from the African culture as well. As you see, there's some of these 
figurative sculptures (Guardians) here in the background (where I 
was 
sitting for the interview) that have the African gods as references but in my 
way of interpreting them. Actually, my artwork shows a 
fusion of my 
inspirations. If you look at my Guardians, they are called "Orishas" in the 
African religion, they have something from the ocean; lots of different 
10 
texture, intricate forms. I 
make flowers, too and when I 
make them, for 
example, (I 
love flowers) I 
add a 
little bit of the ocean inspirations to them.] 
I 
feel that all my inspirations are fused, and they are all connected. Here in 
this country, I've been here for so many years. I 
don't have the ocean [close 
to me]. [In fact] I 
wish I 
had, at least a 
little closer that I 
could go 
sometimes. [It's kind of far to go to the beaches for a 
weekend, though I 
started exploring others options to continue having a 
deep connection with 
nature. That includes hiking, traveling to state and national parks, biking 
and, camping, which I 
had never done in my whole life. I 
hike almost every 
day.] Anyway, I 
feel like that some of my art work has influences from this 
connection [that have developed here in the US, but as I 
said I 
fuse them all 
to make my art]. [For example, the flowers I 
make], I 
don't create literal and 
realistic ones. I 
kind of fuse them with my influences from the ocean. That's 
pretty much what happens with my pieces [in general]. 
[00:21:59] 
Little Thunder 
So all cf your you 
don't do any wheel-thrown work at all. It's all hand-
built pottery that you do. 
Prado 
I 
just do [the wheel when I 
have to teach ceramics because most of the time 
it's part of the courses, but I 
don't use it for my clay art]. All of my pieces 
are hand-built. I 
don't know [why but it might be because I 
like the more 
vast possibilities of hand building techniques]. The wheel throwing is good, 
but it's also kind of too structured. I 
like the imperfection of hand-building, 
and I 
like to show a 
little bit of imperfection [in my clay pieces]. I 
feel more 
free to explore texture in shapes and forms when I 
hand-build. 
Little Thunder 
You also do installations. Can you talk about a 
coiAple cf your more 
challenging installations and what you were trying to convey with those? 
Prado 
I 
love installations, and I 
wish I 
was doing more, in fact. I 
had a 
few when I 
had my MFA show. [They were] pieces inspired by the African rituals, and I 
had quite a 
lot of them on the wall. It was very interesting to view them 
because each one was very unique. What I 
like about [my] installations is 
that sometimes when people see a 
lot of things all together, they have so 
many interpretations. My work is very symbolic, [therefore] it is subject to 
different interpretations. I 
like that [aspect] because sometimes people see 
things that I 
don't see [in my clay pieces]. It's great to [exchange 
information] when I 
have the chance to talk to viewers, and some say, "I 
see 
this and that." I 
say, "Oh, I 
didn't mean that, but it's great that you see that." 
[By the way], I'm working on one now for my next solo exhibition. I 
think I 
like [installations because I 
have a 
chance to, first of all, put the pieces 
together at the site and being able to see them as a 
group and even make 
some changes on how to display them]. 
11 
[00:24:12] 
Little Thunder 
That'll be exciting. How has your background in architecture played out in 
your work? 
Prado 
It gave me a 
good foundation in drawing, in perspective, and a 
few other 
things. [Actually, what] I 
like the most in architecture is the artistic side of 
it. [When I 
studied it, I 
enjoyed the drawing classes and painting classes 
more than any other. I 
feel that these classes were very helpful when I 
entered the art program at TU. My 
first ceramics class was tile making. 
Some of my tiles are very geometric. I 
believe I 
was influenced by my 
architecture background when I 
made them.] 
Little Thunder 
What kind c 
f 
studio space do you have? Is it at your home, or is it 
elsewhere? 
Prado 
Yeah, this is my home. I 
have a 
room here. It's a 
kind of loft, where I 
keep 
my pieces that are ready [to be displayed or sold]. I 
work, also, in my garage 
when I 
have some clay and the weather [is not either very hot or very cold]. 
[Then I 
use the kilns at TU. Since I've been teaching there, I'm able to fire 
my clay pieces there. Also, both Teresa and the current director, offered 
some alumni art students access to the kiln room if they needed to fire 
pieces. In fact, I'm grateful to have this opportunity to fire at TU because I 
can't have a 
kiln in my house. Sometimes, I 
work on my clay pieces there, 
too. This studio where I'm now is like a 
little shop, a 
little gallery.] 
[00:26:20] 
Little Thunder 
How did you first get involved in the gallery scene in Tulsa? 
Prado 
First of all, when I 
was finishing my [BFA, I 
had to have a 
show and had to 
be somewhere other than the] TU gallery. That's when I 
had my first [solo] 
show. It was at a 
coffee place [with a 
gallery space on Brookside]. [Then 
later], I 
had my MA show at TU gallery. [After I 
graduated], I 
started 
looking for a 
gallery that would [display] my work. [The Lovetts Gallery 
offered me an opportunity after they saw] my show at TU. [Also, I 
got an 
award from an art competition they hosted. I 
met the owner and his son and 
I 
signed my first gallery contract with them. After two years, I 
left Lovetts 
Gallery. Being at TU was wonderful in the sense that I 
was much more 
exposed to the art world especially after my MFA show.]

coming iAp, obviously, and we'll talk a 
little more about that later, but a

I 
think my [two] graduate shows were probably the most memorable ones. 
[The MA 
in printmaking was quite interesting because my advisor that time, 
knowing that I 
was doing ceramics], allowed me to show some of my 
ceramic pieces. It was a 
good combination because I 
had [some ceramic tiles 
right next to the prints I 
used as reference. I 
loved it because I 
could see the 
transition that my work was leaning to. I 
was very happy with that show. I 
didn't expect to have any ceramic pieces in it. That part was quite 
interesting. I 
could foresee my future as an artists after that show. My MFA 
thesis show], was also another one that meant so much to me not only 
because I 
was very happy with everything that I 
was able to produce, [but 
also with the personal accomplishment behind it]. I 
did a 
lot. I 
was like a 
machine [making clay pieces]. 
How many pieces? 
...creating, creating. Oh, my goodness, I 
don't know [how many exactly]. I 
had the whole gallery pretty much for me. There was another part of the 
gallery that another student used, but I 
used pretty much eighty percent of 
[it]. I 
was able to put everything I 
created [during the last year of my MFA]. 
I 
loved it. It's not only that I 
was very happy with my pieces and everything 
that I 
was able to produce and create, but it was an emotional 
accomplishment. [I 
got it all on my own since I 
did not get any benefits from 
TU due to the divorce. It was all my efforts.] When I 
looked at everything, I 
felt so happy with myself and with what I 
was able to accomplish. That one 
was memorable. I 
will never forget everything around that exhibition. 
You got a 
grant from the Oklahoma Visual [Arts] Coalition. What was that 
for? 
Yes, I 
was getting ready for a 
solo exhibition that was supposed to be in 
October 2020, but [due to] the pandemic, it was postponed. [ Since 2019, I 
started] having more contact with OVAC because I 
was one of the Tulsa Art 
Studio Tour artists [that same year]. I 
became a 
member [and aware that 
they offer lots of grant opportunities for the members]. [I 
decided to apply 
for one of these grants in order to get some financial help to finish preparing 
for my exhibition]. I 
got the grant and [with that money I 
was able to get all 
the supplies I 
still needed for the show]. [Actually, since the exhibition was 
rescheduled, I'm still working on some new pieces for it.]

It's going to be in January [20]22. It's still long ways [for that to happen, but 
I'm very excited and looking forward to it]. I [will] have more pieces than I 
was initially planning to [have but it is great so I 
can choose the best for the 
show]. I 
don't stop making art. I 
just keep going. 
That's great. What kind (-f  
a 
reception have you had 
for your work so far? 
You mean like from the public in general? I 
have had very good support, 
and I [enjoy] the idea that people like my work. I 
like to have contact with 
the people that buy my pieces. Sometimes I 
know who; sometimes I 
don't. I 
want to hear a 
little bit about their feedback, what made them buy the piece. 
I've had very good [responses]. For example, there are those who love the 
flowers, those who love the pieces that I 
usually submit to gallery shows. 
I'm not saying that I 
don't submit the flowers, but the flowers are more 
[popular]. How can I 
say? I 
think [they are] more like for the sales part, too. 
I 
sell flowers quite [often]. In general, I 
have good reception. My work is so 
diverse. I 
make so many different things [which] helps a 
lot with the 
reception, because I 
can please a 
large audience. Also, I 
offer to change 
colors [and sizes] if anybody wants to have a 
commission [on something 
they like but prefer some alterations]. I'm flexible. I've got [lots of 
commissions recently]. 
That's important. How about your connections to either the Brazilian 
community or Portuguese-speaking communities in Oklahoma? 
There's quite a 
few, and it's getting bigger and bigger. I 
have a 
lot of good 
connections. I 
have very good relationships. We are far from our families, 
and some of them are [like family here]. [I 
spend Christmas, Thanksgiving 
with some of them since] I'm not able to go to Brazil during those holidays. 
I 
wish I 
could. They are very supportive friends. We get together and have 
fun. We cook [Brazilian] food. We pray because I 
have a 
praying group. I 
have very good friends. It's good to be around them. We share the same 
feelings of being homesick sometimes, and it's good to speak our language 
[as well]. 
Speaking the language, yeah. 
Yeah. 
So you teach in an amazing variety cf venues. You teach at TU, the Dual 
Language Academy, and part cf Tulsa Public Schools, Tulsa Community 
14 
College, Increase, d,.) ferent student bodies, d,.) ferent ages, d,.) ferent reasons 
for being in the class, I'm sure. How do you adapt for each groiAp? 
Prado 
I'm part-time in all of them, in fact. I'm very active, and I 
look for 
opportunities [and I 
usually find good ones]. When I 
moved to this country 
[I had in mind] "I'm coming to this country because there are much more 
opportunities," and that's what I 
look for. I 
started my first job [ at TCC, 
right after I 
graduated in 2013]. I 
started teaching Art Appreciation. It's not 
like a 
studio class [as I 
wished but I 
enjoy teaching it]. [Initially], it was very 
challenging. I 
learned a 
lot. [It has been a 
very enriching experience]. I 
love 
the [whole] process [of teaching and still learning]. When I 
look back, [I 
think about how] much I 
have learned with my students, with the teaching 
process, and all that together. [A 
year later], I 
started working for the 
Gilcrease Museum [as a 
teaching artist]. [Occasionally, I 
was asked to teach 
ceramics at TU. Recently, I 
have been teaching Art Foundations 2D design 
at TCC besides Art Appreciation.] 
At the Gilcrease Museum, I [used to teach] art programs, and one of them 
was the Any Given Child. I 
was there for quite a 
while teaching summer 
camps, too. I 
taught summer camps, also, at ahha, Philbrook, anywhere that 
there was an opportunity for me and I 
was able to do it. I 
was just like, "[I 
will apply for a 
position, let's see what happens]." [Teaching at] TU comes 
occasionally. I 
love teaching there because I 
teach ceramics. I 
taught also [a 
few workshops] at Waterworks. [However, I 
realized that I 
needed a 
job 
with some] benefits and a 
steady income. That's why I 
applied for a 
position 
at Tulsa Public Schools. [There I 
teach art at an elementary school. It has 
been already two years. My experience there has been] very different from 
anything else I 
have done before. The system is completely different, and I 
like it. I'm learning a 
lot, and it's been [a 
very good experience]. 
[00:37:19] 
Little Thunder 
So how did the pandemic impact your teaching? 
Prado 
A 
lot because I 
had to learn how to teach in distance learning. It was very 
challenging. I 
questioned myself, "How am I 
going to teach arts like that?" 
At that time, I 
was teaching for TPS and TCC. For TCC, I 
had to be certified 
to teach online, so I 
did a 
workshop [to be entitled to teach remotely]. [In 
fact, even before the pandemic, I 
knew that I 
needed that certification to 
broaden my teaching options. That's exactly what happened. My TCC 
classes switched to only online mode.] TPS was a [completely] different 
thing. I 
questioned, "How am I 
going to be teaching kids [ art remotely]?" 
We decided in our school to pre-record the art classes, [a 
decision made by 
the special classes' teachers]. [Recording art classes was a 
very different 
experience. Having just me right in front of the camera was quite weird.] [I 
was wondering], "I 
hope the students can understand everything. I 
hope they 
15 
can follow [along]." [It was frustrating to not be there in person to give them 
some feedback. Anyways, it was very challenging because I 
still had to learn 
how to use the program to post videos and grade their works online.] 
Anyway, now we are back in person. This [spring] semester at TU, [I 
have 
been teaching] ceramics in a 
hybrid mode. [It would be impossible to] teach 
ceramics without being in the studio. [Anyway, all these new experiences 
were part of a 
big change in my life.] I 
felt a 
little bit anxious in the 
beginning. I 
just said to myself, "Take your time to learn, to adjust, because 
this is what it is. That's our reality now, and it has to work." It has worked. 
[00:39:07] 
Little Thunder 
How about your artwork? How has the pandemic impacted your artwork? 
Prado 
In fact, I 
didn't stop working. I 
brought some clay home, because I 
felt like I 
needed to continue creating. The pandemic closed a 
lot of things but the 
pandemic never closed my creativity. The pandemic [would never] close my 
contact with nature. I 
was walking more. I 
was observing nature more. [I 
pondered, "This situation is not going to stop everything in my life." So with 
some clay brought home, I 
was able to make pieces in my garage and then 
take them TU to be fired.] I [used] the social media a 
lot. I 
was [always] 
posting my new work and, to be honest with you, I 
had one of the best years 
ever with sales. I 
sold a 
lot last year. I 
felt that people were more home and 
probably looking around it and [thinking], "I 
need to do something here. I 
need probably to remodel [this, that] or to redecorate, and to do something 
in my home." Then, "Maybe that wall needs a 
piece of art [and so on]." 
[Honestly speaking, I 
was never much] into business, like sales, but I 
[needed to learn]. [My 
boyfriend has helped me a 
lot with his experience in 
sales. He said, "You have to be a 
little bit bolder. You have to offer options 
to customers.] If somebody says, "I 
wanted this," and you say it's sold, say 
back, "I 
can do something similar. How about this? How about that?" I 
started doing this, and it [worked]. Also, I 
offered to deliver for free within 
Tulsa limits. Some said, "How am I 
going to get it? How am I 
going to pick 
it up?" I 
said, "Don't worry. We're going to keep the distance. I 
will be 
wearing a 
mask, or I 
just [place your commission by the door]. [Payment 
could be through one of these phone apps and just by leaving it by the door 
upon delivery." I 
was facilitating things to make the sales very smooth and 
stress-free.] It worked. 
Little Thunder 
Good learning experience there, too. 
Prado 
Yes. 
[00:41:07]

Little Thunder 
That's great. That's wonderful. Even when it's not a 
pandemic, how do you 
balance your art and your teaching? 
Prado 
Little Thunder 
Prado 
Little Thunder 
Prado 
I 
wish I 
had more time [to make] more pieces because sometimes I'm so 
overwhelmed [with] teaching. [Teaching is not only being in school but also 
grading, preparing lesson plans, responding to students, helping some and so 
on. I'm always grading on the weekends. I 
notice that when I 
have some free 
time I'm still grading, grading, and grading.] Since I [have been teaching] at 
TU, I 
try to be there a 
little earlier, or I 
leave later [in order to have some 
extra time to make some pieces when I'm completely done with the 
students]. That's how I 
manage [ art and teaching]. [When I 
have 
commissions that I 
know they will take weeks to make, I'm very honest with 
my clients by saying it's going take a 
while for the pieces to be ready 
because of...." It's hard to give them an exact due date but in the end things 
work out well.] Things [get] better once I'm out of school. [However, while 
teaching], I 
wish I 
had more time [to make pieces] but I 
need to work. I 
need 
to teach. 
So you do have that little bit cf summer, yeah. 
[Yes, I 
do.] 
You make annual trips back to Brazil. Why are those important to you? 
Since I 
was pregnant, with my son, I 
have gone to Brazil every year. [The 
past summer I 
was not able to go] because of the pandemic. [I'm already 
vaccinated] and things are getting better. [However], they are not doing well 
there. These trips mean a 
lot to me [mainly because I 
am able to be with my 
family]. [All my family members are there]. I 
don't have any family here in 
this country except for my son. Also, [I 
go to Brazil] for him to see his 
family. [Grandma, grandpa, cousins, aunts, uncles, etc. It is very important 
for me and for him to have this bond with Brazil. I 
remember a 
funny story 
when he was little. At his school there were some celebrations like 
Grandparents Day.] I 
was [always] there. [I 
used to tell him], "Your 
grandparents are not here, but I'm here." One day, my mom was here 
visiting with us, and she went to pick him up with me [from school]. [We 
went straight to his classroom for my mom 
to see him, his teachers and 
classmates. When he saw her, he said, "I 
have a 
grandma! I 
have a 
grandma, 
everybody! Please see, this is my grandma!" I 
felt so sorry for him. Anyway, 
so he loves going [to Brazil]. It's so fun to be with my family. [There, we 
relax and I 
have "my real vacation" because we do not live the daily routine 
and it is just fun, always visiting everyone, having parties, gatherings and 
going to the beaches.] It is very important [for my soul] to connect with my 
family and have my son connect with them, as well. I 
miss them a 
lot. It's 
hard sometimes. I 
wish Brazil was a 
little closer.

I 
understand. 
And also one thing... 
What's been one cf—go ahead. 
[Another very important thing to add about my traveling to Brazil is] that I 
get a 
lot of inspirations [while there]. I 
come back recharged emotionally 
and [ artistically]. [I 
have the contact back with the ocean], I 
go with my 
mom to museums [and visit artists]. So I 
come back with a 
lot of [new 
ideas]. 
Creatively recharged. 
Creatively recharged, yes, exactly. 
Well, so far what's been the biggest highlight cf your career, biggest 
highlight moment? You have many more years to come, I'm sure. 
I 
think it's just my participation in exhibitions, being accepted in some, 
being able to network a 
lot, and being invited to some exhibitions. I 
think 
that's a 
good point. I'm planning to be more exposed to other galleries, other 
than the ones in Tulsa. I 
have been in shows in different places like Texas, 
Kansas, Virginia, Las Vegas, and Brazil. I'm planning to apply for more 
exhibitions out of Oklahoma. I 
need a 
little bit of more time to prepare 
pieces for [those types] of shows. [Also, having more solo shows would be 
fantastic.] That's my next goal. [I'm looking forward to the next one in 
2022.] 
Those are good, good goals. What's been a 
low point so far? 
Sometimes hearing "noes." When I 
apply for shows, I 
hear some "noes," 
some "yeses," too. Sometimes I 
feel like, "Why? Why not? Why was I 
not 
accepted?" We don't have any feedback, so I 
don't know. I 
wish they could 
say why, and I 
would say, "Okay, I 
understand." [With some feedback, I 
would look for some improvements or rethink about my work or something 
like this. I 
understand that sometimes it is not a 
question of having bad art, 
it's just a 
question of considering that some pieces do not fit well into the 
show or into whatever the jurors have in mind for it. Throughout my 
professional life, I 
felt left out a 
few times, but this is something that I 
was 
able to overcome.] [I 
believe that] whenever a 
door shuts, others open, and 
sometimes they open much wider. Anyway, there is a 
lot of opportunities 
18 
[out there in the art world]. We 
just have to look for them. [I'm open to 
explore a 
lot. If it's not through one way, it could be through others. 
Fortunately, I 
always find good things.]

[00:50:22] 
Little Thunder 
Yeah, with women artists, it's sort cf a 
struggle, anyway, and then when you 
have that, like you said, global positioning or when you've come to this 
country, then that's another positioning that maybe sometimes you don't 
always maybe have the, feel like you have the irfrastructural siApport. Well, 
do you have any other comments or things you'd like to add to what we've 
talked about? Is there anything else? 
First of all, I 
love this idea of being able to talk about my art and my 
life, 
even my personal life. I'll tell you one thing that I 
feel. It's so good to have 
a 
profession. It's so good to be independent. It's so good to do what you like 
to do. It's so good to work [with what you like]. I'm very privileged. I 
don't 
make much money, but I'm so happy with what I 
do because I 
teach what I 
[love]. Teaching is wonderful. I 
learn a 
lot from my students. My mom is 
still teaching. She's over eighty, and she's still [an active professional]. [I 
keep telling her], "I 
want to be like you. I 
want to teach until I 
am able to." 
Again, I 
learn a 
lot from my students. [As a 
matter of fact], I 
learn even 
English from my students a 
lot. (Laughs) Still learning every day. 
Right, the current slang that we don't know. (Laughs) 
Also, it's good to be on the other side. I 
was a 
student for so many years, 
and I 
have a 
lot of empathy for them, too, because I 
know what it is to be a 
student. [To finalize] I 
would say go for your dreams. If you have big 
dreams, keep dreaming. When I 
felt that I 
had everything to give up, I 
felt 
even stronger. I [used my problems and frustrations] as something that 
motivated me a 
lot [to fight]. That's my big advice to whoever might be 
struggling in life and might be considering giving up. Don't. Keep working, 
keep doing and keep dreaming. Art is wonderful and has been my big 
escape. It has been my big friend, my best friend. [It is a 
means of 
communicating and of expressing my emotions and fears.] Anyway, and you 
know what? Sometimes I 
look at my art [pieces and think], "What am I 
going to do with all this?" [That's why] I 
give a 
lot of them away. I 
love to 
do it. I 
don't need a 
lot. [I'm happy to have my art in people's home so I 
will 
always be remembered.] 
That's wonderful. Well, we appreciate everything you're bringing to the 
Tulsa art scene. Thank you for your time, Cristiana. I 
hope I 
can catch your 
exhibition in 2022.
