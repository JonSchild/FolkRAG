A FEW WORDS 
Regarding the Ham- town Students may perhaps be accepta-
ble to and relished by many. 
If not, don't take it. 
I 
shall 
not endeavor to investigate their pedigree, as it would be 
utterly useless, none of them being able to remember far 
enough back to give any faint idea of their birth- place or ante-
cedents. 
Who first conceived the idea of burlesquing the fa-
mous Hampton Students I 
do not know ; were I 
possessed of 
that knowledge I 
would most undoubtedly give him credit for 
it. 
They were first produced at the Olympic Theatre, 624 
Broadway, rev York, under the management of Mr. John F. 
Poole, on Feb. 8th, 1875—the quartette consisting at that time 
of those greatest of musical mokes Messrs. Sanford and Wilson, 
Mr. Billy Gray, the talented blonde comedian, and your hum-
ble servant. 
From the first night the ham- towns were pro-
nounced a 
hit. 
Messrs. Sanford and Wilson being obliged to 
appear in other cities, Mr. Wm. Courtright, of Racy renown, 
and Mr. Sam Holdsworth, the great tenor robust°, appeared in 
their stead. 
On Messrs. Courtright and Gray leaving, Mr. G. 
W. II. Griffin, the eminent basso and composer, and Mr. John 
Gilbert, song and dance artist, joined the liam-town forces, 
forming the great Olympic Quartette, viz., Messrs. Gooding, 
Griffin, Gilbert, and Holdsworth, who for eight months delighted 
the patrons of that ever popular theatre ( and their name was 
legion) with the irinimitable quartettes, glees, and bymns ; sur-
prising even the musical critics with their beautiful harmony 
and local hits, receiving as much applause on their last appear-
ance as on the evening they were first produced. 
Veni, Vidi, Vwi. 
Yours to command, 
E. D. GOODING. 
OLD BLACK JOE. 
[Copyright, 1S7:7, by Rom-
Tr N. DEWITT.] 
A SKETCH FOR TWO CHARACTERS —W HITE and BLACK. 
[Scene, a road—plantation in the distance. 
Enter OLD 
BLACK JOE, as the music plays "Home, sweet home." 
lie 
leans upon, his staff, and listens.] 
OLD BLACK JOE.—Home, sweet home! 
Oh, how long I 
have sighed to see it once again. 
I've been a 
wanderer up 
and down the world for the last twelve years, and many a 
time have I 
dreamt of the old plantation and the old folks 
there. 
And now, when I'm almost to my journey's end, I 
arrive in sight of the dear old place at last. 
I 
haven't got 
many more miles to go before I'll lay these poor old bones of 
mine down for the last time. 
How well I 
remember good old 
massa and missis. 
Den there was young Massa Charles, and 
den there was my wife Clohoe. 
De tears come rolling down 
my cheeks when I 
think of old times. 
But I 
must plod along 
to the old plantation. 
[Enter CHARLES.] 
CHARLES. — Why, as I 
live, it's Old Black Joe! 
OLD JOE.—Who calls Old Black Joe ? I 
haven't heard that 
name in twelve long years. 
CHARLES.—Why, don't you know me, Joe? 
Don't you 
know your old Massa Charles' son, whom you used to dance 
upon your knee ? 
OLD JOE.—What! you Massa Charles' son—young Massa 
Charles ? 
Well, well. 
[They shake hands.] 
CHARLES.—Yes, Joe ; and I'm glad to see you back. 
OLD JOE.—But tell me, bow is old massa, Massa Charles ? 
Is he well ? 
CHARLES.—Joe, I'm sorry to say the old gentleman, my 
father, has passed away. 
OLD JoE.—Old massa gone! 
Good old massa! How is 
missis? 
CHARLES. —011 thanks be to heaven, she is still among us. 
OLD JOE.— And—ami—Charles, how is my poor old wife, 
Aunt Clohoe ? 
Is she well ? 
CHARLES.—Mas! she's been to rest these live years. 
OLD BLACK JOE.—[CONTINuED.] 
OLD JOE.—Oh, don't say that, Massa Charles! 
Don't say 
that! 
CHARLES.—It's too true, Joe. 
But cheer up! 
Welcome 
back home ; you shall never leave us again. 
OLD JOE.—Can I 
stay on the old plantation, massa? 
CHARLES.—Yes, my dear old playmate. 
OLD JOE.—Thank ye, Massa Charles, thank ye! 
And so 
they are all gone. 
Even my poor wife. 
I 
think I 
hear their 
voices calling me; and I 
feel that I 
soon shall go. 
CHART,ES.—Don't you recollect that good old song you used 
to sing once on a 
time, Joe? The one you called Old Black 
Joe ? 
OLD JOE.—Yes, yes; but I 
haven't had the heart to sing it 
these many days. 
CHARLES.—Do 
sing it for me now, that's a 
good fellow; and 
I'll go down to the foot of yonder tree, and listen as I 
used to 
do when I 
was a 
little boy. 
OLD JOE.—If it will please you, Massa Charles, I 
will. 
CHARLES.—Do. 
The sound of your voice, once again, will 
bring back a 
thousand reminiscences of the days that are past. 
Sing the old song, Joe. 
[EXit CHARLES.] 
OLD JOE.—Ab! once I 
was happy when I 
sung; but now 
Old Joe is pretty nigh broken down. 
[The music plays " Old Black Joe." OLD JOE sings the 1st 
Terse. 
In the Chorus, the words " I'm coming," are echoed after 
JOE behind the scenes,- the remainder of Chorus is sung by JOE, 
with the exception of the last line, which is sung 'very softly 
behind the scenes also. 
After the conclusion of the song, 
CHARLES returns, and slowly leads OLD JOE of the stage. 
OLD JOE, overcome with emotion, leans upon, his young massa. 
The complete music of "OLD BLACK JOE," with the Piano Ac-
companiment, is published by W ILLIAN A.

Where are the hearts once so happy and so free? 
The children so dear, that I

Gone to the shore where my soul has longed to go.

" 
IT'LL NEBBER COME NO MO'." 
The following is from the pen of Mns. F. 
G. 
DE FONTAINE, of Charleston, 
South Carolina. 
I'SE been waitin' long for de good old time 
Dat'll nebber come no ino', 
When I 
used to work, an' rock, an' sing 
In de ltttle cabin do'. 
My Sam was dar wid his fiddle, 
Po' Sam—he's gone—done dead! 
Dead for de want oh food an' clothes, 
An' de shelter ober head. 
An' little Mose—well, he's dead, too; 
how he used to dance and sing, 
While Jim, an' Polly, an' all the res' 
Went rota an' rotuf de ring. 
Ole Missis—bless her dear ole soul— 
Would half till her sides gib way, 
An' massa'd stop at my cabin jest 
To say, " How's ole Mammy, to-day ?" 
De boys—I 
mean ole massa's boys— 
Dey bibbed ole Mammy, too; 
Who nussed ' em, eh'ry blessed one, 
Clean down to little Mass' Loo. 
Po' Massa Loo ! he went to fight, 
But he nebber came back no mo' ; 
We heard dat he fall wid a 
ball in de breust, 
In front of de battle roar. 
He'd put his arms aroun' my neck 
An' say, " Mammy, I 
love you so!' 
He didn't see no harm in dat, 
Do' his Mammy was black an' po. 
Ole missis died wid a 
broken heart 
When the las' oh de boys was killed, 
An' massa bowed his head an' cried 
Pat his cup ob sorrow was filled. 
An' yere I've sot awaltin' an' watchin' 
For de good time comin' no mo', 
An' I 
see ole Missis a-
callin' Mammy, 
Across from de odder sho'.

Isaac was ransomed while 
He laid upon the altar bound, 
Moses, an infant cast away, 
By Pharaoh's daughter found. 
CHORUS. 
Didn't old Pharaoh get lost, get lost, get lost ? 
Didn't old Pharaoh get lost in de Red Sea ? 
Joseph by his false brothers was sold, 
God raised above dem all— 
To honor his child de Lord foretold 
How Eli's house should fall. 
Cita—Didn't 041 Pharaoh, etc.

As dey strode along de shore,

You nebber see no more."

STOP DAT KNOCKING, OR SUSY BROWN. 
I 
once did love a 
yaller gal, whose name was Susy Brown', 
She came from Alabama, and was the Wrest in the town 
Her eyes so bright that they shine at night, 
When the moon has gone away; 
She used to call this nicrga up, 
Just afore th e broke of day, 
With a ' Who dar, who dar, who dar, who dar knocking 
at the doer ?' 
Spoken—Am dat you, Sam, no ' tis 
Why, Sam, ain't you aaine to luff me in ? 
No ? you'd better stop dat knockin' at the door. 
'Let me in,' 
Stop dat knockin'. ' Let me in.' 
Stop dat knockin', ' Let me in.' 
Ali I 
you better stop dat knockin' at my loor."Let me in: 
' 
Stop dat knockin', stop dat knockin', stop dat knockin', 
'Stop dat knockin', oh I 
you better stop dat knockin' at my 
door.' 
She was the handsomest gal dat eber I 
did see: 
She neber went out walkin' with any colored man but me; 
I 
took my banjo to the house, to play three times or more, 
When I 
heard two or three knocks pretty hard, 
Come bang ag'in the door. 
Spoken — With a Who dar, who dar,' & c. 
ROME AGAIN. 
Home again, home again, from a 
foreign shore ; 
And 0, it Ins my soul with joy, to tneet my friends once more. 
Here I 
dropped the parting tear, to cross th e oce an '
s f
oam ; 
But now I'm once again with those who kindly greet me home. 
CHORUS. 
Home again, home again, from a 
foreign shore; 
And 0, it fills my soul with joy, to meet my friends once more. 
Happy hearts, happy h9arts, with mine have laughed in glee, 
But 0, the friends I 
loved in youth seem happier to me. 
And if ms- guide should be the fate which bids me longer roam, 
But death alone can break the tie that binds my heart to home. 
Home again, &C. 
Music sweet. music soft, liners round the place ; 
And 0, I 
feel the childhood charm, that time cannot eflitce. 
Then give me but my homestead roof, 1'1 ask no palae(2,. dome ; 
For I 
,zan live a 
happy life with those I 
love it home. 
LITTLE FOOT-STEPS. 
Little foot-steps, soft and gentle, 
Gliding by our cottage door, 
How I 
love to hear their trample, 
As I 
heard in days of yore ! 
Tiny feet that travelled lightly 
In this weary world of woe— 
Now silent lie in yonder church-yard, 
'Neath the dismal grave below— 
Little foot-steps soft and gentle, 
Gliding by our cottage door: 
How I 
love to hear their trample, 
As I 
heard in days of yore ! 
CHORUS. 
Little foot-steps, soft and gentle, 
Gliding by our cottage door: 
how I 
love to hear their trample, 
As I 
heard in clays of yore ! 
She sleeps the sleep that knows no waking, 
By the golden river's shore : 
And my heart it yearns with sadness, 
When I 
pass that cottage door— 
Sweetly now the angels carol, 
Tidings from our loved ones far, 
That she still does hover o'er us, 
And will be our guiding star. 
She sleeps the sleep that knows no waking, 
By the golden river s 
shore : 
And my heart it yearns with sadness, 
When I 
pass that cottage door. 
Little foot-steps, Sse. 
.Little foot-steps now will journey, 
In the world of sin no more, 
Ne'er they'll press the sand-banks lightly 
By the golden rivet's shore-
-Mother, weep not : father, grieve not : 
Try to smoothe your troubles o'er— 
For 111 think of her as sleeping, 
Not as dead, but gone before. 
Little foot-steps now will journey 
In the world of sin no wore, 
Ne'er they'll press the sand-banks lightly 
Fey the golden river's shore— 
Little foot-steps, &c. 
Way down upon the Swanee ribber, 
Far, far away, 
Dare's wha my heart is turning ebber, 
Dere's wha de old folks stay. 
All up and down de whole creation, 
Sadly I 
roam ; 
Still longing for de old plantation 
And for de old folks at home. 
CHORUS. 
All de world am sad and dreary, 
Ebry where I 
roam; 
Oh! darkeys, how my heart grows vrea:7. 
Far from de old folks at home. — 
All around de little farm I 
wandered,' 
When I 
was young; 
Den many happy days I 
squandered, 
Many de songs I 
sung. 
When I 
was playing wid my brudder, 
Happy was I; 
Oh! take me to my kind old mud.der, 
Dere let me live and die. 
All de world, ete. 
One little hut among de bushes, 
One dat I 
love; 
Still sadly to my memory rushes, 
No matter where I 
rove. 
When will I 
see de bees a 
humming, 
All round de comb ? 
When will I 
hear de banjo tumming, 
Down ha my good home.

THE HEN CONVENTION. 
A famous Hen Convention 
Was held in Humbug Green— 
Such a 
s'ow of fuss and feathers 
Ne'er before was seen, 
With Malays, Bantams, Chitagongs, 
And game- fowls, fine and tall; 
But Mr. Rooster Shanghai 
Cut the biggest swell of all. 
It was cackle, cackle, cackle, cackle, 
Flap your wings and crow; 
And Shanghai shanged the highest 
At the lieu Convention Show, 
Says Malay, pulling out his gills, 
"I'm the fairest fowl," 
Says Bantam, " You're a 
hen-pick'd race— 
Hen-hearted, with no soul." 
Says Shanghai, " Your poor Bantams 
Are a 
race of chicken toys," 
ys Bantam, " If you peck at me, 
You'll find I'm one of the boys." 
It was cackle, Inac.. 
.A poultry duel came on straight— 
'Twos Bantam and Shanghai; 
A crow at first, and then a 
clip, 
And then the feathers fly. 
Young Bantam spurred him flat, 
Amid a 
loud convention crow; 
And Shanghai shanged the lowest 
At the great Convention Show. 
It was cackle, & c.

POOR UNCLE PETE. 
Words by ED. H ARRIGAN. 
On I 
many years ago, away down in Dixie, 
That's when I 
was a 
poor old slave, 
I 
told you that I 
had a 
heap of pleasure. 
Now everything am silent as the grave, 
All the boys that belong to good old massa 
Am scatter ' round the country in a 
heap, 
I'm lost, I'm bewildered, I'm dumbfounded, 
Oh, what will become of Uncle Pete ? 
I'm lost, Pm bewildered, I'm dumbfounded, 
Oh, what will become of Uncle Pete 1 
CHORUS. 
Poor Uncle Pete, come along, 
Poor Uncle Pete, come along, 
Children now am calling, 
Poor Uncle Pete come along, 
Poor Uncle Pete come along; 
Yes, I 
am coming, 
Yes, he is coming. 
No more will I 
see my good old missy, 
Dey laid her slowly inn de clay ; 
She sickened and she withered like a 
flower, 
Yes, from dis weary world she's passed away, ' 
So I 
roam round here, ' mong you strangers, 
And try hard to shuffle wid my feet ; 
I'm crippled, I'm aged, I'm rheumatic, 
What will become of Uncle Pete 1 
I'm crippled, I'm aged, l'm rheumatic, 
What will become of Uncle Pete ? 
Poor Uncle Pete, etc. 
'Souse me, white folks, for dis feeling, 
That flows spontaneous from de heart, 
I ' spect I'll soon cross o'er de river Jordan, 
Whar we'll meet again no more to part ; 
But while I 
stay down here among you 
I'll try and please you white folks all a 
heap. 
I'll collapse, I'll go under, I'll expire, 
Dat's what'll become of Uncle Pete I 
I'll collapse, I'll go under, I'll expire, 
Bat's what'll become of Uncle Pete. 
Poor Uncle Pete, etc, '

I COULDN'T STAY AWAY. 
SONG AND DANCE . 
AS 
sung by LIZZIP. LA 
GRANGE, of Howe's Circus. 
Way down in old Virginity, 
Where I 
was bred and horn, 
That rosy, sunny country, 
used to hoe the corn, 
In childhood's happy moments, 
My heart was light and gay. 
I've been to see my birth-place. 
For I 
couldn't stay away. 
C1101215S. 
For I 
couldn't, nor I 
wouldn't, 
I 
couldn't stay away from there, 
For I tvouldn 't '
cause I 
couldn't, 
Deed I 
couldn t 
stay away. 
I 
once did love a 
yellow- gal, 
Way down in Dixie's land, 
And I 
one day the question popp'd, 
To give me her heart and hand. 
Says she to me my heart's been won, 
And from me you must stay, 
hut she was only 3oking., 
And I 
couldn't stay away. 
For I 
couldn't, nor I 
wouldn't, 
I 
couldn't stay away from there, 
For I wouldn't 'catt.-
,e E

Deed I

And if I

But the yellow rose of Texas beats tire belles of Tennessee. 
Where the Rio Grande is flowing, and the starry skies arel

She thinks if I 
remember, when we parted long ago, 
I 
promis'd to come back again, and not to leave her so. 
She's the sweetest, dr,c. 
Oh ! now I'm going to find her, for my heart is full of woe, 
And we'll sing the song together, that we sung so long ago; 
We'll play the banjo gaily, and we'll sing the songs of yore, 
And the yellow rose of Texas shall be mine forever more.

DAR LING , 
I am growing old, 
Silver threads among the gold 
Shine upon my brow to-day; 
Life is fading fast away ; 
But, my darling, you will be—will be 
Always young and fair to me— 
Yes! my darling, you will be 
Always young and fair to me. 
CHORUS . 
Darling, I 
am growing, growing old, 
Silver threads among the gold 
Shine upon my brow to- day; 
Life is fading fast away. 
When your hair is silver white, 
And your cheeks no longer bright 
With the roses of the May, 
I 
will kiss your lips and say— 
" 
Oh, my darling, mine alone—alone, 
You have never older grown— 
Yes! my darling, mine alone, 
You have never older grown ! 
Darling, I 
am growing, etc. 
Love can never more grow old; 
Locks may lose their brown and gold, 
Cheeks may fade and hollow grow, 
But the hearts that love will know 
Never, never winter's frost and chill; 
Summer's warmth is in them still— 
Never winter's frost and chill, 
Summer's warmth is in them still. 
Darling, I 
am growing, etc. 
Love is always young and fair— 
What to us is silver hair, 
Faded cheeks, or steps grown slow, 
To the heart that beats below 7 
Since I 
kissed you mine alone, alone, 
You have never older grown— 
Since I 
kissed you mine alone, 
You have never older grown. 
Darling, I 
am growing, etc. 
SAILING ON THE LAKE 
The Music of this song is published by Wm. A. POND & CO., 547 Broadway, 
New York City. 
Price 40 cents. 
ONE day while walking down Broadway 
I 
met my cousin Joe, 
lie asked me then if I 
with him 
To Central Park would go; 
With my consent we then did start, 
And reached the lake at three, 
We took a 
sail, and words of love 
Were pass'd by Joe and me. 
CHORUS . 
Sailing on the lake, 
To the music of the birds, 
The rippling of the waters, 
And the sound of loving words. (
Repeat.) 
On our return we took a 
stroll, 
And soon did reach the mall, 
When from the distance music sweet 
Upon our ears did fall ; 
We sat and listened to the band 
Beneath a 
hawthorn tree, 
While gentle breezes carried words 
Of love from Joe to me. 
Sailing on the lake, etc. 
Now Joe has asked me to be his, 
Of course I 
won't refuse, 
And pa has given his consent— 
This chance I 
must not lose ; 
And when some day at Central Park 
The lake you go to see, 
I 
know you'll whisper words of love, 
Like my dear Joe and me. 
Sailing on the lake, etc.

But de angels watches over me when I

Dar was a 
happy time to me, ' twas many years ago, 
When de darkies used to gather round de door ; 
When dey used to dance an' sing at night I 
played the old banjo, 
But alas, I 
cannot play it any more. 
De hinges dey got rusted an' de door has tumbled down, 
And de roof lets in de sunshine an' de rain,

De foot- path now is covered o'er dat led us round de hill,

An' de creek is all dried up where we used to go to mill ; 
De time has turned its course anodder way ;

THERE'S A MEETIN' HERE TO-NIGHT. 
Camp-meetin' down in the wilderness— 
There's a 
meetin' here to-night; 
Amongst those shoutin' Methodists— 
There's a 
meetin' here to-night. 
CHORUS. 
Get you ready, there's a 
meetin' here to-night; 
Come along, there's a 
meetin' here to-night. 
I 
know you by your daily walk— 
There's a 
meetin' here to-night. 
I'm born of God, I 
know I 
am— 
There's a 
meetin' here to-night; 
And you deny it if you can— 
There's a 
meetin here to-night. —Cho. 
I'm a 
Methodist bred and a 
Methodist born— 
There's a 
meetin' here to-night; 
And when I'm dead there's a 
Methodist gone— 
There's a 
meetin' here to-night.— Cho. 
This world may talk and I 
will pray— 
There's a 
meetin' here to-night; 
And live for Jesus every day— 
There's a 
meetin' here to-night. — Cho. 
Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego— 
There's a 
meetin' here to-night; 
We try your religion whether or no— 
There's a

DASHING FEMALE SWELL. 
Music by J. E. STEWART. 
Sung by \V. 
E. 
LYLE. 
Published by J L. PETERS, 
599 Broadway, New York, 
I 
AM a 
gay and dashing belle, 
As you are all aware, 
I 
love to dress and cut a 
swell, 
With me none can compare ; 
I'm always cheerful, light and gay, 
My heart is never sad, 
I 
strive to cast dull care away, 
To keep my spirits glad. 
CHORUS . 
Oh, yes, I 
am a 
gay young belle, 
And well I 
love to cut a 
swell ; 
Among the boys, and girls as well, 
I 
am called the Female Swell. 
The other day I 
caught a 
beau, 
lie offered me his arm, 
He talked so sweet, we walked so slow, 
He worshipped every charm; 
He spoke his heartfelt love for me 
In words I 
cannot tell. 
"Pray stop," said I, -" for don't you see 
That I'm the Female Swell." 
Oh, yes, I 
.am a 
gay, etc. 
As I 
walk down the crowded street 
I 
toss my flowing curls, 
And smile on every gent I 
meet ; 
Fru envied by the girls, 
The little dears they are so shy, 
Their thoughts they dare not tell, 
They are afraid to wink so sly, 
Like me, the Female Swell. 
CHORUS . 
Oh, yes, I 
am a 
gay young belle, 
I 
love to dress and cut a 
swell; 
Among the boys, and girls as well. 
I 
am called the Female Swell,

SWEET KITTY CLYDE. 
0, wno has not seen Kitty Clyde ? 
She lives at the foot of the hill, 
In a 
sly little nook 
By the babbling brook, 
That carries her father's old mill. 
0, who does not love Kitty Clyde 
That sunny-ey'd, rosy-cheek'd lass, 
With a 
sweet ditnprd chin, 
That looks rougish as sin, 
With always a 
smile as you pass. 
Sweet Kitty, dear Kitty, 
My own sweet Kitty Clyde, 
In a 
sly little nook 
By the babbling brook, 
Lives my own sweet Kitty Clyde. 
With a 
basket to put in her fish, 
Every morning with line and a 
hook, 
This sweet little lass, 
Through the tall heavy grass, 
Steals along by the clear running brook. 
She throws her line into the stream, 
And trips it along the brook side ; 
0 
how I 
do wish 
That I 
was a 
fish, 
To be caught by sweet Kitty Clyde. 
Sweet Kitty, dear Kitty, 
My own sweet Kitty Clyde, 
In a 
sly little nook 
By the babbling brook, 
Lives my own sweet Kitty Clyde. 
How I 
wish I 
was a 
bee, 
I'd not gather honey from the flowers, 
But would steal a 
dear sip 
From Kitty's sweet lip, 
And make my own hive in her bowers. 
Or, if I 
was some little bird, 
I 
would not build nests in the air, 
But keep close by the side 
Of sweet Kitty Clyde, 
And sleep in her soft silken hair. 
Sweet Kitty, dear Kitty, 
My own sweet Kitty Clyde, 
In a 
sly little nook 
By the babbling brook, 
Lives my own sweet Kitty Clyde. 
" SOLID DISHES TO THE FRONT.?' 
As sung by BILLY Bnicn of the San Francisco Minstrels. 
AIR.—" Spring, Gentle Spring." 
BEANS, beans, Boston baked beans, 
Served up red-hot on a 
Sunday morn; 
Bean, beans, Boston baked beans, 
Is a 
dish that is fit for a 
queen, sure's you're born! 
Whenever you go to Boston town, 
Get some one to show you round; 
Smoking red-hot on the plates, 
Oh, how I 
love those Yankee dates I 
You may talk about your good clam chowder, 
Talk about your whiskey sour— 
CH01117 S. 
Give me beans, beaus, Boston baked beans, 
Served up red-hot on a 
Sunday morn, 
With coffee, sugar, bread, and cream, 
Is a 
dish that is fit for a 
queen, sure's you're born. 
Hash, hash, mysterious hash ! 
In a 
second-class hotel you never miss hash; 
Hash, hash, beautiful hash ! 
It's a 
hard crowd to tackle, but easy to catch; 
I've travelled this country thro' and thro', 
This famous conundrum is always new; 
Talk of scrambled eggs, crumbs and crust, 
But mysterious hash is more robust; 
Reed-birds, quail, champagne and ice, 
Canary birds stuffed is all very nice— 
CHORUS. 
Hash, hash, mysterious hash 
In a 
second-class hotel you never miss hash ; 
Hash, hash, beautiful hash! 
It's a 
hard crowd to tackle, but easy to catch. 
Cheese, cheese, Limburger cheese! 
Floating so gayly and sweet in the breeze ; 
Cheese, cheese, Limburger cheese, 
Bring me a 
dish of sweet Limburger cheese ; 
At Miller's saloon I 
take my ease, 
And revel on lager and Limburger cheese; 
That's the luscious stuff to eat, 
For it makes your breath so sweet. 
Tall: of love in Cupid's bowers, 
Talk of the balm of a 
thousand flowers— 
CHORUS. 
Cheese, cheese, Limburger cheese! 
Floating so gayly and sweet in the breeze ; 
Cheese, cheese, Limburger cheese, 
Bring me a 
dish of sweet Limburger cheese.
