P:69
 
I should like to report a special experience with the
 
speech editing process.  The tapes from which I worked f
or this paper
 
I had previously transcribed in p
art some five years before, in connection
 
with a manuscript I was then preparing on the life story of Mrs. Jones,
 
the principal speaker.  Since the manuscript was to be "
in her own words"
 
I had made a special effort, while working on the original transcription,
 
to take down her speech verbatim in my written copy.
 
In point of fact, of course, I had not done so, and in
 
checking back over the tapes and my original tranaciprion of them
 
from the point of view of speech editing, I discovered that I had res -
ponded to her editing signals in a clearly observable patterns
 
1)  In the case of the two trivial rules (word repetition
 
and fillers) I had tended not to include these in the original copy
 
except in a few cases where I apparently had felt the hesitation had
 
some emotional or meaningful significance.
 
2)  i
t's. Jones' editinga according to Rule I
. I general'y
 
had transcribed verbatim.
 
3)  I
ts. Jones' editings according to Rule II, I had
 
transcribed about half the times some of them I apparently had classified
 
as trivial repetitions.
 
4)
 "Mazes" I had eliminated almost entirely even though,
 
when I came to re-transcribe them for this paper, I found that some of
 
them had lasted several seconds and took up several lines of copy.
 
Furthermore, even with my attention alerted to the ddittng problem,
 
I still was not conscious of (
did not "hear") some of the lengthy
 
editing etringasuntil I had re-listened to the tapes three or four times.
 
My general hypothesis from this experience is that the
 
editing process operates most powerfully to erase data where nonsense
 
is involved (that is # where the hearer is unable to get any information
 
whatever out of the word stream) •
 However • if there is any scrap of
 
information to be obtained at all, it remains reasonably accessible
 
to the hearer  .  that is, he "consciously" follows, or is aware of,
 
the editing process.
 
The speaker in the accompanying data is a sixty year
 
old Afro-American woman with perhaps three years of formal education,
 
who was born and brought up in eastern rural Georgia.  The last thirty
 
years of her life have been spent on St Simon's I
sland, off the Georgia
 
Coast, where she joined the Georgia Sea I
sland Singers, a semi-profes-
sional singing group who have made occasional appearances off the
 
i
sland.  This whole region, especially St Simon's is one in which
 
the American Creole language, Gullah, is widely spoken, but I have
 
heard her use almost no Gullah lexical items (which I could recognize)
 
nor does her accent appear to me to sound like that of other Gullah
 
speakers I have heard.
 
I do feel, however, that certain syntactic and morphologi-
cal features of her dialect have at least been influenced by her
 
Gullah-speaking neighbors.  The pertinent features of Gullah listed
 
I
.
 
by Turner
 which appear relevant to her dialect are the followings
 
a) absence of the passive voice
 
b)  verb phrases without propositions, conjunctions, etc.
 
(Cited by Turner, He take stick kill em.)
 
c)  Frequent repetition of words and phrases.
 (Cited by
 
Turner i  I hoard the house cracking, you know, at the backj heard the
 
house cracking, cracking, and I listened, kept listening.)
 
d)  distinction of number in noun and verb forms is rare
 
e)  nouns are generally uninflected by case
 
f)  verb forms often show no tense changes

' have not had time to

I suspect that this book is outdatods
 
appear to me to be standard black
 
pursue this in depth.
 
I am not equipped to do a proper dialect analys is
. of
 
ts •  Jones' speech, but obviously some of the above features are
 
significant in being able to tell whether or not real speech editing
 
is taking places one has to know (
or intuit) whether the speaker thinks
 
something has been said that is wrong in order to tell whether a cor-
rection i
s being made or whether the remark is simply being amplified.
 
The editing signals  in her speech appear to me to be standard, but I
 
am not absolutely positive that I recognize all of them,
 
In the speech samples which follow, there are
' several
 
specialized featurew which I have handled in transcription as followas
 
1)  There is frequent use of apposite phrases and clauses  I have
 
not considered these to be speech editing and have set them' off by
 
punctuation.
 
2)  The speaker frequently uses "because" as a short-hand symbol
 
for "this is because" •
 I have punctuated these utterances as though
 
they were grammatically complete, since this is clearly what the
 
speaker feels they are.
 
3)  I have used the syllable "em" where I could not tell whether
 
"him" or "
them" was intended.
 
4)  Otherwise, I have stuck to standard English spelling except
 
in a few places where I made tentative attempts at phonetic transcription.
 
This data actually should have been phonetically transcribed throughout.
 
5)  A high proportion of the ddittng events seem classifiable as
 
either Rule I or Rule H
e for examples "Brother Wolf uh Brother Fox".
 
I have used vocal stress as the determining factor in those' cases s
 
where the speaker says "Brother Wolf uh Brother
 I have classified
 
it as a Rule II editing occurrence,
 "Brother Wtlf uh Brother Fox"
 
without noticeable stress "
sounds" to me like Rule I
.
 
6)  1 have lumped under the category "mazes" what seem :
tO me three
 
different types of editing events, but I could not think of a better
 
way to handle them.  First there are "false starts" whore an editing
 
signal sends you back over the preceding utterance; finding no "r"
 
or "R", you just go on to the sentence juncture and start over.
 
The second category is possibly idiosyncratic to Mrs. Jones.  She
 
occasionally puts in strings of not very meaningful words in what
 
appears to be an attempt to keep the word stream going until she can
 
think what to say next.  Those are actually elaborate fillers and
 
perhaps should be classified as such; their editing signals are fre-
quently unclear, I have noticed.  Third are what I have come to think
 
of as "trt e mazes", characterized by a proliferation of editing signals
 
which pilq up until total erasure occurs.
 
Lastly, I should like to apologize for what seems to me
 
an inordinate amount of verbiage surrounding a minute amount of hard
 
data.  The specialized nature of the dialect made me feel I should
 
inc1ude complete transcriptions of the total utterances, not just the
 
editing occurrences I was able to recognize.  The inclusion of the
 
tctal transcription made me feel then that I should try to explain a
 
bit of what she was talking about and that cut down on the amount
 
of data I was physically able to handle.  Finally, I suppose I am a
 
socio.lingutst at heart, for I tried to solve my over-proliferation
 
problem'by
, selecting four speeches for analysts, all taken from different
 
social and personal contexts.
 
It all makes for a lot of talk.
 
TAPE BAND A
 duration: 3:15
 
Social contexts
 
This was a relaxed personal interview at the kitchen
 
table over coffee.
 I was present as well as a close woman friend of
 
Mrs •  Jones', a member of the Sea Island Singers who said almost nothing.
 
We had been chatting for perhaps ten minutes at the time of this oxerpt
 
from the conversationj the overall atmosphere seemed extremely comfortable.
 
Subjects 
I had deliberately opened the conversation by bringing
 
up the general topic of babies and infant care, partly because I par-
ticularly wanted to know her opinions on the subject, partly because I
 
have found that this topic is one which builds fast rapport and is a
 
happy, relaxed subject to discuss with older women.  Just before this
 
particular part of the conversation, we had been swapping different ways
 
to play "Patty Cake".
 
Comments: 
Speech editing is a frequent occurrence throughout this
 
interview; though only fifteen seconds longer than Band D, this exerpt
 
contains almost three times as many editing occurrences, including the
 
most tortuous "mazes" of any of the four selections.  This is interesting
 
in view of the fact that, to me at least, this interview experience
 
seemed the most relaxed and least strenuous of all of them.
 (Actually,
 
I initially chose to transcribe it for this paper because I recalled
 
the occasion as so relaxed; I had anticipated finding the least editing
 
here, rather than the most.)
 
It seems to me there are two possible explanatory hypotheses.
 
First, this is the only conversational i
nterview; the others are all
 
performances: story-telling or public speeches.
 It is possible that
 
conversations, where a higher percentage of spontaneous or newly-created
 
utterances are likely to be engendered
 • may consequently produce more
 
occasions for speech editing.  A second possibility is that  *s. Jones,
 
in that she was giving me her opinions on points of child management,
 
may have felt herself to be in a situation of social stress, though
 
she gave no behavioral clues other than the frequent editing.  I per
 
eonal y incline toward the first hypothesis, though there is no reason
 
that the two should be mutually exclusive.

Social contexts
 
This recording took place in a small social group in my
 
home.  Mrs. Jones and I were present along with four of the other Sea
 
Island Singers.  We had arranged to have a story-swapping session and
 
were sitting around with coffee, the tape recorder running inconspicuously;
 
by the time of this interview, nobody seemed to pay it much attention.
 
This particular story ca m
e early in the session after three or four
 
jokes had been told.
 
Sublects 
t
'
f
rs. Jones had told me this particular traditional Afro-
American tale earlier in the day (at which time I had been unable to
 
record it).  She had first heard the story from her father who, she
 
told me, used to play the banjo during the song part and made something
 
of a special production out of telling it.  This is therefore a reason-
ably frequently practiced narration; she has probably heard and told it
 
many times during her lifetime and had "rehearsed" it only that morning.
 
Comments :
  
Speech editing is relatively infrequent in this narration.
 
In length it is comparable to Band C  which is twenty seconds shorter
 
and contains nearly twice as many editing events •
 Since Band C comes
 
from the same interview (much later on), it seems to me that the factor
 
of social stress can be postulated as roughly the same for both B and C
.
 
I suspect that overall familiarity and/or the recent practicing of this
 
particular narration are the factors most crucial in deducing the
 
frequency of speech editing here.
 
As a side note, in my lead-in question (
the highly incom-
petent speech editing in which I have not tried to analyze) I said,
 
"Bror  Rabbit".
 It is interesting to note Mrs. Jones' polite imitation
 
of my "Brar" at the beginning of her story and the gradual shift to
 
her own normal "Brother" as the story goes on.

BAND C.
 duration (without song) 4.00
 
Social context:
  
This band was recorded at the same session as that des-
cribed in Band B
.  We had been swapping stories for about an hour.
 
Subject, 
The preceding day, Mrs . Jones had told me she remembered
 
part of an old song her mother used to sing called "Old Nero" (
the
 
ancient British ballad "Little Musgrave and Lady Barnard").  she was
 
distressed over her inability to remember the whole song and wanted
 
to delay taping it for me until she could get the rest of the verses
 
from her mother in Georgia.  I had urged her to sing what she knew and
 
toll the rest of the story, and she agreed.
 
COmment8s  
Taken overall, speech editing is moderately frequent in
 
this interview.  More importantly, editing is noticeably clustered
 
towards the beginning of her narration while she was telling the part
 
of the ballad story not included in the verses she remembered.
 (Actually,
 
her plot line for the beginning section is so far removed from the normal
 
plot line of this balk e
d that I believe it to be her own oral literary
 
creation.)  By line 42, she had reached the part of the story told
 
in the verses she did recall and editing drops off sharply.  Approximately
 
three-quarters of the editing events take place during the first quarter
 
of the narration.
 
This could be because she gathered confidence as she went
 
along; however, the other transcriptions show editing more evenly spaced
 
out throughout her speech.  My own impression is that she stopped needing
 
to edit
so  much when she got tbet e part of the story who was reasonably
 
sure of.  In the last section she uses occasional direct quotations from
 
the ballad lines and I have included a transcription of the sung text
 
of the baila4 in order to make this plain.

 ?

boy came there, young man came there; he didn't, he was a single
 
boy, very nice lokking and intelligent, but he was sort of poor.
 
And he worked with this old, with this man; this man had one
 
daughter and his daughter was off in school.  The boy likted the
 
girl and the girl liked the boy, but the man thought that the boy
 
VOICE DROPPED AND SPEEDED)
 
was too poor, you know, for his daughter.
 And when yonder, you know
 
he didn't want the boy, the girl to marry the boy, but they liked
 
one another.
 
So # a
nyway, this boy still stayed there with him while
 
this girl was in school; this boy boarded right there with him and

worked with him, and uh in the same house with his room off like a

would Nero, you know, uh, believe him, or would he, you know,

uh, uh, just, just, what • what would he, how,
 would he take
 
it,  'cause he know how crazy he was about his wife.  And he
 
wondered uh, you know, would it be right to tell him?
 
31)
 Then he say if he didn't toll him (
in his mind was, the
 
12)
 story read) that if he didn't tell him and Nero found out he'd
 
2
.
 
33)
 knowed it that long, Nero would, might want to kill him for not

34)
 tolling him.  So he was just,  he JX W didn't know what to do; but
 
35)
 his mind say he go and tell him.  And he couldn't do anything, or
 
36)
 run him away from there or do anything, 'cause he going to tell
 
37)
 him.  He wasn't going to let it be, you know, that he catch him
 
38)
 knowing it and not telling.
 
39)
 So, he decided go in the woods this night this man was
 
40)
 there in the bed with his wife and tell Nero, so he did; he went
 
41)
 in the woods and told him.  That's where I begin the song in
 
4t v4 
I
 
42)
 there; L ye **.II think I knew how the other verses went, but
 
43)
 I knew how the story go.  And he went in the woods and told his ;
 
44)
 and Nero told him, "Now if this the truth you brought to me, I
 
45)
 ain't got but one daughter in this whole round world and her
 
46)
 
47)
 
48)
 
49)
 
wedding you shall be."  (He ir
nowed that boy wanted the girl.  He
 
done come to like the boy more than the boy thought anyway, you
 
know, working with him.) He said, "But if it's a lie you brought
 
to me, a rope and a gallows and a

and a burying suit, and
 
So, the boy went on back to the house, and he said to
 
Nero, "Blow before you got to the house."  He didn't slip home.
 
(F

He blowed as usual his horn, in there 1 a hunting horn; and the,
 
the girl, the man heard the horn.  The man felt like that was Nero;
 
he told the woman, say, "
I think I hear Nero coming; I better go."
 
She told him, "No t It's not him," • cause she thought,
 
you know, it's too soon for him.  She says, "No, it's not him."
 
She says, "My father's boys in the woods blowing up sheep,"
 
(
'cause they generally blew up sheep that early part of the night).
 
And uh so, say, "Lie still and keep me warm; it ain't nothing but
 
my father's boys in the woods blowing up sheep."
 
So, uh, he then stay on that time.  Nero come in through
 
the shed room by the boy's room, see, come on in and when he come
 
in through the door, there the man was in the bed with his wife.
 
So the man, he told him, "Rise up, rise up and put on his clothes
 
66)
 and fight me for your life; I wouldn't have it to say that I
 
67)
 slayed you naked, laying in the bed with my wife."
 
68)
 So the man got up.  He told him to wait and gave him
 
69)
 a chance to the door, said "
I ain't even got a pocket knife.
 
70)
 and you got a gwi and a sword."
 (He was the man told Nero.)
 
VOLUME DROPPED
 
71)
 Nero laid it down, you know, and so that gave his a chance for
 
his life, going to fight him for his life.  Sure enough, the
 
73)
 man comes a.gaining on Nero, really gaining on him,  '
cause
 
74)
 Nero had, Nero first was beating the man.
 
75)
 He asked the man. "How do you like my fine feather bed?"
 
76)
 (He beating him then.)  "How do you like my sheet?  How do you
 
77)
 like my fine little maid that laid in your arms asleep?"
 (He
 
78)
 was beating him.)  And the man turn on him, on Nero, began to get
 
79)
 the best of Nero.  He told him, says, "SO well I like your fine
 
80)
 feather beds so well I like your sheet; much better"
 (he got
 
81)
 the gun to kill him, see)  "
I like your fine little maid that laid
 
82)
 in my arms asleep."
 
83)
 That time the boy, who seen it all, the boy come out and
 
84)
 grab the gun and killed the man, saved Nero.
 So. I just don't
 
85)
 know how all the verses that go in there but I know that part.
 
86)
 All right.

Social context:
 
This is an exerpt from a tape of a public performance
 
at the Fairview Hospital for the mentally ill whore the Sea I
sland
 
Singers had been invited to give a performance-demonstration for the
 
nursing staff and selected patients.  There was an audience of perhaps
 
four hundred presents the Singers were not on stage but seated in an
 
informal semi-circle at one end of the gymnasium, on the same level
 
as the audience.  This particular speech came after about fifteen
 
minutes of the performances the audience was responding warmly and with
 
enthusiasm.  Mrs. Jones and two of the other Singers had just demon-
strated the "Juba" dance.
 
ub l
ect:
 
Mrs. Jones is giving here the folk etymology traditional
 
in her family for the term "
Juba", which Lorenzo Turner has identified
 
as a Yoruba "day-name".  The word is used throught the West Indies and
 
the southern United States as the name of a particular dance and clap-
ping pattern known usual'y by only the oldest of the black community.
 
Mrs •  Jones learned her explanation of the term from her maternal grand-
father, who had been born into slavery in Virginia.  Her etymology is
 
probably historically wrong, but emotionally clearly valid.
 
Comments
  
In spite of the public situation, speech editing is
 
markedly infrequent in this utterance.
 "Juba" is one of the most dramatic
 
and audience-appealing of the Sea I
slander dances and i
s thus frequently
 
included in their programs •
 Since the group learned it from Mrs • Jones,
 
she always gives the introduction and this is therefore a frequently
 
practiced utterance, though it is in no sense rehearsed.
 (As a group
 
the I
slanders do not work out eons introductions in advance.)
 
I have never been able to tell whether or not public
 
performance constitutes a stress situation for ?
'
ka. Jones.  She shows
 
few signs of pre-performance nervousneesj on the other hand, she works
 
hard during a concert and is physically drained afterwards.  My own
 
impression is that she concentrates almost exclusively on what she is
 
doing during performance and for this reason is minimal'y affected
 
by personal embarrassment, shyness or self-consciousness.
 
It is hard to tell which of the two factors
 relative
 
absence of stress (assuming I
'm right) and relative frequency of
 
practice is more critical here in terms of reducing the amount of
 
speech editing.  My hunch is the latter, but W e pure hunch.
 I have
 
looked through my tapes for a less frequently practiced public speech
 
of equivalent length for comparison but have found nothing.

TAPE BAND D  (254-311)
 
1)
 Now that's one of the old plays I think (LAUGHS) I can
 
2)
 remember my grandfather telling us about;  'cause he was brought
 
3)
 up in Williamsburg. Virginia, he used to tell us about how they
 
4)
 used to eat ends of food - -  that' s what "Juba" means •
 They said
 
5)
 "Juba" when they meant "giblets".  That's what they meant: "giblets"
 
6)
 but they said "Juba".  You know, that's ends of food; they had to
 
7)
 eat (PAUSE) the left-overs.
 
8)
 And uh so that's the song they made up (PAUSE) about
 
9)
 themselves: how how they had to do.  Just to get uh get uh uh
 
(MICROPHONE IS BEING RESET DURING THIS PASSAGE)
 
10)
 thing off their brains, off their minds, so they know it was
 
U)
 right bad.  The mothers would cook for the people, but yet 
 
12)
 couldn't uh they couldn't er-ah feed their family like they want
 
A
 j
 
13)
 to.
 They couldn't give their children food like they wont, had
 
14)
 to watt until it was all left-over, left (PAUSE) over, and eat
 
H
 
15)
 the en( s of it.
 
16)
 So he say on the week ends, they would take the mi ed"up
 
17
 fooJ and put it together; I
've seen troughs up there i
r' William-
18)
 burg,  Virginia, where be was brought up at.  Said that[ they used to
 
19)
 eat out of those long troughat mush, cush, all this stuff put
 
20)
 together and put plenty milk in it.  But he live a hundred and
 
21)
 five years  -
 so
 I
, I can't say that made him live, but I say
 
22)
 it didn't kill him.
 (LAUGHING)  I know that.
 For one thing, it
 
F
;Ile,r p
tv.i
. s.
 
23)
 just didn't kill him.
 And so, and I
'm I
'm up here a long time
 
24)
 too; I never eat like that but yet and still he have taught us a
 
25)
 many time how he did that.
 
26)
 So in this "Juba" they san
 
(
SWALLOWS) they would sing
 
27)
 about it, 'cause the mama couldn't feed them like they wanted to.
 
28)
 Said,  "Juba this and Juba that" (that meant a little of this and
 
29)
 a little of that, see?)
 "Juba killed a yellow cat."
 (That
 
30)
 meant Juba would, nmi  mixed up food (PAUSE) might kill the white
 
31)
 folks see?  All right.
 (And they didn't care if it did, I don't
 
32)
 suppose, but they said that (LAUGHING) that, that, the word they
 
33)
 said.)
 
Juba this and Juba that
 
Juba killed a yellow cat
 
Get over double trouble, Juba.
 
36)
 Some day they meant they would get over double trouble; they'd cook
 
35)
 their own Juba.  What g
t owuu ei  double trouble" means I won't be
 
36)
 in this trouble here none; I
'll get out of it and get over double
 
37)
 trouble; I
'll cook my own food some day.  See?  All right.  So.
 
38)
 You sift the meal and you give me the husk
 
You cook the bread, you give me the crust
 
You fry the meat, you give me the skin
 
And that's where mama's trouble began.
 
39)
 You see?  So that's what it meant; the mother would
 
40)
 always talk with them about they wished they could feed them,
 
41)
 and they wished they could give them some of that good hot pies
 
42)
 or hot cornbread or hot whatnot, you know?  But she couldn' t
.
 
43)
 She had to wait until, and give em that old stuff that was left
 
-
 
44)
 over.  And then they began to sing it and play it; say, "Juba
 
45)
 up";  (
that mean everywhere, all around the whole country).
 
46)
 Juba up and Juba down
 
Juba all around the town
 
Juba for ma. Juba for pa...
 
47)
 
48)
 
49)
 
(You notice, we don't say "mama" and either "papa".  You see?
 
Let's say it like they say its  "maO and "pa".  Say,
 
Juba for ma and Juba for pa,
 
Juba for your bro ther .
.
in
1aw .
N
 
50)
 See?  'Cause they didn't (LAUGH) so just everybody, all ii' ii'
 
51)
 that meant everybody had juba, and they made a play out of it.
 
52)
 And so that's where "juha" come in; we say "
Juba" and
 
53)
 they say "Juba", but it's "giblets"  -
 the meaning of it.
 'Cause
 
54)
 they spoke, they, they spoke quick, you know, and said "gibba"
 
55)
 
56)
 
57)
 
(LAUGHS)  So that's what, that;s where that song come from.
 It
 
would get all

Anansi went to say to the King that he would catch the person who

rummers can bring their drumsk.
 
Well now, Goat knew how to play the violin,
 Then Nanansi went anh

the birthday party with our drums."  Then
 
Goat a song he was to sing, which went:

Goat was to answer with the violin, saying
 
It is I

Well now, Anansi went to steal the King's  watch.

 Anansi went to tell the King to say, if the Kinr'
 
wanted to pay him, he would catch the thief.
 But the King must give a
 
dance,  then the person's mouth will itself tell that he stole the watch.
 
Anansi went to call Bobo (

 But I am going to give you a wat:ch to  nut:  int'

 There where Little-Hare remained, when he look€

skin, and took it into the bush to put it out to dry; and he returned
 
and dragged himself through thorns, and scratched his ears all over.
 And
 
he went back to the village, and began to cry.
 When evening came, he
 
said,  "Sir, we have been attacked here; don't you see your child,  Sir, on( ,

#11 THE LION, THE SPIDER AND THE HYAENA

This is about a Lion,  (who) had bought a ram.

(he kept it ?
) thus until the ram grew up, and was given the name
 
Barra randam.
 A bell was tied on its neck.
 The ram grew big.
One d
 
the Lion was going to look for food at a distance.
 When the Spider he
 
the news, he came and asked the Lion to let him look after the ram.

Then the Spider said,  -

 "Nothing will happen to him.

"All right,  I will leave it (
let me leave it)." When the Lion had gone,
 
the Spider took the ram.
 He went and killed and ate it.
 He put the s
lHr
 
and bell by.
 He put the fat by.
 Then the Lion came home,  (and) the Spid.
 
came crying and said,  -
-
 "Somebody (
thing) has stolen the ram."  Then t

Lion said, -
-
 "That is a lie."  He said,  -

 Then the Spicier tied the bell on her neck.
 He brought ir

1909 in Jemaan Daroro (N. Nigeria)...  The most serious difficulty one en-
counters is to keep pace with the narrator.
 To stop him for an expinat:ion
 
is often to disturb him so much that he loses the thread of the tale,
 
the speeches also are sung in a falsetto voice, and this alters th-
sounds and even the accents of vowels.  •. .
 Lastly, as Mr. Hartland
 
in THE SCIENCE OF FAIRY TALES (p.  18),  "It is by no means an uncommon t
id
 
for the rustic story-teller to be unable to explain expresst

sneaking of a collection of Swahili tales by M

never been published,  tells us that almost of all of the tales had "
sunr

s
arts" and of some of these even they who sang them could scarcely exp  i

 I often found that, although several men would give the
 
sentences in exactly the same way, not one could explain their meaning,
 
and I had to ask the  xk assistance of the Alcali, or native judge -

37 EATING TIGER'S GUfS:  INCRIMINATING SONG: THE KILLING HUT bAt
 
Anansi said to Tiger,  "Father, don't you want to bathe?  I have
 
a fine pool here."
 Tiger said,  "No, no, my boy.
 If I go to bathe,
 
must take out my belly,  then only can I go and bathe."  Anansi said,
 
"Well,  then, take it out, father."  Tiger took out his belly,  then he
 
went to bathe.
 Anansi watched, and when Ig Tiger went to bathe,  then
 
he ate Tiger's belly.
 When Tiger finished bathing, he said,  "Where i
'
 
my belly?"  Anansi said,  "I don't know;  just now it kw was here."
 'n n
H
 
said,  "Father,  I will show you who ate your belly."  Tiger went awa";
 
Anansi, too.
 
On the way, Anansi met many monkeys.
 They were singing,  they wer
 
going to a wake.
 Anansi said,  "You boys,  yo u  m us n' t  si ni
 so,
 you musr
 
sing,
 
"We ate Tiger's bell'',
 
It was sweet;
 
We ate Tiger's belly,
 
With salt,
 
With pepper.'
 
The monkeys said,  "Yes, a F
ine son .
 
Then Anansi went to Tiger, and he said,  "Father,  I inc
'
 ho a
t
i
 
belly.
 I will take you where they are."  Tiger said,  "
tine, r
ay boy.
 
Anansi took Tiger to the wake where the monkeys were.
 The monkeys were'

 Anansi called one of the monkeys, and he said,
 
Hello, friend, did you forget the song I told you to sing?"  The monker
 
said,  "Yes,  I know it."  He went in the house a

Tiger heard them.
 He jumped inside t

 Anansi went with those who ran away.
 He said,  "So
 
come,  I am going to show you a nice thing."  He put a kettle of water rn
 
the fire.
 He said,  "You boyw,  I am going inside the kettle.

 The whole town is filled (populated by) Hares.

long the ground in a leather bag.
 When he had come (gone), all the

 "What kind of goods  (

 But he said,  -

 "Oh no.
 
If it were taken from me,  the medicine would become uselessx"finishe ).
 
When food had been brought  (made), he (Hare) took some, and put (
it)
 
inside the bag and gave (
it) to the Dog, who ate (
it).

 Then the Hare said to the Dog,  -

they came to a Hyaena's farm (where) the Hyaena was working with her cul-
.
 
As the Hare dragged the Dog, k they trod down the Hyaena's guinea-corny
 
(for the Hyaena).
 Then the Hyaena said,  -
-
 "Who is that who is destro H
 
(going to destroy) my guinea=corn?"
 So the Hare said, -
-
 "Oh, Hyaena,
 
is that what you are like (your character ? Would you not like a bit n r
 
luck?"  But the Dog heard (them speaking) thus, so he came out wi L a
 
"boop" from the bag.
 The she (Hyaena) said,  -
-
 "I shall go and krp
 
have broken down my guinea-corn."  When they saw her coming,  the Hare
 
away.
 The Dog (also) ran away.
 Then the Dog returned to the villai
 
where he was living in friendship with the Hare.

Brother Rabbit and Brother Wolf were going to see  roL

 Brother Fox had some pretty girls and smart: c
't r--
 
•
d almost everybody called Brother Fox "Mister Railroad" h
 
s always up and down the railroad tracks stealing chicken
 
So Brother Wolf was very smart and  strong,  and ti
l
 
Lked him.
 They would call him to help do different things droutin
 
hat's  the story they tell) more than they would Brother Rabbit,  boo-
-
o th er  Rabbit was so light,  and he couldn't (

 Brother Rabbi;
 
1dn't like that.
 He liked to do good things and liked for the gir.
 
want him to help.
 He got jealous of Brother Wolf.
 
So he didn't know any other way  to get at Brother Wolf,  s
 
went in Brother Box's taters and he dig up t

then a trick to do to Brother Wolf.)
 
Do the girls were going to give a big party.
 And he (Broth
 
Thit) told Brother Fox,  says,  "I tell you what I
'll do.
 I founl  n

 (Because they didn't have no j

 And he'll tell you

 I

"Sure enough; you do that for me.

All right.
 He went on and told Brother Wolf, says,  "Brot
 
f
, do you know what?  The girls are going to give a party and the
 
nt us to play for them.
 And you've got that big gross voice,  see;
 
u can bass.
 So now I got a little song that we can sing, and when
 
sing that song, you do the hassing.
 And those girls -
-
 oh,  they ". ,
 
so glad!"
 
"All right."
 (He's so glad of that, you know, because
 
ntod to do everything good for them girls, make them happy.)
 
They went down underneath the hill where nobody couldn'

call-and-response structure to his stupici

 The first half of the
 
(the call) announces the crime;  the second
 
of the song (the response) is a confession.
 
The dupe, who does not know that a crime h
 
been comm itted, accompanies the trickster L
 
a public gathering and assists in the perfc
 
of the song;  since his part is the second ha.
 
of the song, he thereby publicly incriminates

exclusively to African music and dance. References to the periodical
 
literature and to larger publications devoted in part to African music
 
and dance will be found in the
- bibliographies noted below:,

Varley, Douglas H
.
 African Native Music: An Annotated Bibliography. London:
 
Royal Empire Society Bibliographies no. 8, 1936.
 
These three bibliographies were constructed with reference to one another;
 
thus each is unique in the time-span covered: Varley's to 1936, Merriam's
 
from 1936 to 1950, Thieme's from 1950 to mid-1963.
 Duplic ation among the
 
three is at a minimum.
 
The bibliography noted below supposedly includes all items from the three
 
abové, as well as new materials.
 In any case, it is the most recent and
 
most comprehensive.

The seminar will be a general survey of antirepologicrl accoun t
h of
 
African and African-derived nusic, with special reference to the
 
relations between music and religious possession in those instances
 
where sufficient data exist,
 although other topics are acceptable.
 
Students who are not familiar with the general orientation of Melville
 
Herskovits and his contributions to the Afro-American field should
 
also be prepared to do some general reading along these lines. The
 
first few meetings will be devoted to a general discussion of African
 
music, specifically an examination of the major theories of rhythm.
 
Later meetings will be devoted to student reports on various New World
 
Negro cultures, hopefully we can follow the following procedure in
 
organizing reports:
 
1. At least one week prior to his report the student should identify one
 
or two significant articles relating to his subject which the entire
 
seminar can then read for the following presentation.
 
2. The report need not be written in advance, although it should be
 
tightly organized to take no longer than about one half hour of written
 
presentation or about forty-five  minutes of written presentation plus
 
musical examples. Allowing about fifteen minutes for discussion, we can
 
thus include two reports per session.

3. A bibliography should be distributed to the class at be time of the
 
report, and an outline if possible. Ditto masters are available.
 
4. Depending on enrollment, dual reports on most topics will probably
 
be necessary; this can either be some sort of j
'int venture, or the topic
 
itself can be subdivided.

Bibliographies: 
A general bibliography of boo3cs on African music is
 
available and will be distributed; it includes references to longer
 
bibliographies of articles and books by Merriam, Thieme, Varley, and
 
Gaskin.
 All these deal mostly with African material; references to
 
New World material is more scattered and will require digging. Of the
 
books listed in the distributed list of Books on African Music and Dance,
 
the following are presumably on reserve:

Discography: 1. Check record reviews and current discography in
 
thnonusicology
  
2. Schwann supplementary  Catalog for current titles.
 
3. Merrjam's reviews in '
Africa Report (on reserve)
 
4. Folk music drawer in the Music library catalog. The
 
music library does not have a very complete collection,
 
but there '
are some old releases which are now difficult
 
to get: e.g. the Library of Congress Series on 78's,
 
specifically Herskovits'  Brazilian material;  and an
 
old, but fine, set of 78's made by Alberts in Jest
 
Africa (Cafe and Tribal f
lusic). 
Records may be heard
 
in the music library using their equipment; you will
 
probably require a note from me to take them out for
 
use in seminar
 
5.  I think there is a disoographi  of Liri an records
 
put out by Africa report some years ago, but I an still
 
trying to locate it.
