July 1954Outline for a booktentatively called FOLKSONG IN CALIFORNIA by SIDNEY
ROBERTSON COWELL
PREFACE:data on field recordings, when made, how come, and where deposited. Some mention of
previous Calif. collectors, (Lummis and Gordon). Reference to Folkways albums if any. Lacunas in
coverage listed here, too: Chinese, Syrian, etc.INTRODUCTORY SECTION of some sort would define
folksong in the broadest possible sense, as song circulated in the oral tradition and discoverable
in 1938-40. "California" folksong is therefore traditional song of any culture, orally transmitted and
sung within the state. Folk music has not been circulated here long enough [?] for California life
to have put a characteristic imprint on it, and English-speaking people have been here a relatively
short time, so they contribute only a part of the state's wealth of traditional music. (California life has
made alight or parodied changes in song texts, of course. And the Spanish guitar has affected a lot of
the music, but that is a southwestern thing, not just Californian. This is n't intended to be a hard-and-
fast Californian book, exactly; but I do have to have some kind of a framework!)
A second general point is that since settlers do seem to come to the same kind of environment
(work, climate, landscape) that they left wherever possible, a kind of ecological organization, to
borrow a term, of this material seems to work out with surprisingly few left-overs. The mines were
a special magnet for a time, strong enough to overcome this tendency, of coarse. But on the whole,
Hebrides Islanders, and other peoples used to the sea, do not tend to settled in the San Joaquin
Valley, nor are the Armenians drawn to the little coast town that the Portuguese Hebrides Islanders
like. Finns stay in northern California, mostly; Texans prefer Los Angeles. And so on.
Therefore the following plan for chapters produces a kind of regional California grouping: what
music has circulated along the west slope of the Sierra and in the mines; what one finds in the hot
[inn#er?] agricultural valleys; and what music is sung up the arms of San Francisco Bay and down the
Coast... And note on improvisation or contemp. songs EACH CHAPTER would then begin by making
the connection between the place the singers left behind, the musical life there, and their location
here-- enough of this to lead a reader to know what to expect. Then would come comment about
a specific group and my relation to it and adventures in connection with it, -- followed by the songs
that belong to that group, the singers comment on their songs if any, and/or further data on the
AFCCC-POP8-2 http://www.loc.gov/resource/afc1940001.afc1940001_pop8-2
song. Insofar as I can, "immigrants" from Wisconsin would be treated in much the same tone as
"immigrants" from Iceland or Italy.

FOLKSONG IN CALIFORNIAOutline -- 2IMusic of the California Missions, of their Indians and on
the ranchos ...
I can probably borrow some Calif. Indian music later on from Dr. Kroeber or somebody, if such a
section seems desirable. But the Indian and the Spanish-Californian music merge in any form in
which I have recovered them. It is scanty, -- true traditional mucic, that is; most Calif.-Spanish stuff I
have recorded is in the form in 19th century popular serenades and musically uninteresting. But I do
have a few gems:
Two Indian lullabies, one from Contra Costa County, one from the Lucias: Lo,lo,lo,lo tata and Lullaby
of the Coyote. (Or these may be two parts of the same lullaby. Anyhow, a great treasure!)
Two chants recovered from Mission Indians, a Santo from Pala recorded for me by a group of Missio
Indian women, and an Alabaio recorded for as by the Seminary choir at Mission Santa Barbara, as
learned from a Santa Barbara Mission Indian named Fernalito. These are both Gregorian in nature,
with Spanish words, and can only have come from the early Mission fathers. Their publication was
reserved to a Franciscan priest I never met, at Santa Barbara, who did publish them, incorrectly
notated and harmonized. So I think I will just publish them again as they really were.
Folkmusic from Spain is Mission San Antonio collection 1 or 2 - Songs from Indian women at
Almaden... if I can make them out.
Spanish-Calif serenades from Mrs. DeSoto at Concord, Mrs. Espinosa at Pacific Grove and Mrs.
Brown at Monterey... samples. They illustrate Italian operatic influence and drawing room music
derived from Chile and Mexico, I think. The influence of the guitar and the popular, not folk,
southern European music that went with the guitar throughout the 19th century (after about 1830)
was strong in the 'social' music of California, and is found among the Indians of Spanish descent
who lived at the Missions and on the Ranchos, as well as among [?] the later Spanish arrivals who
can claim pure Spanish descent because they brought their women with them, unlike the first [?]
discoverers, so we have Las MananitasEl Capotinsung in 3rds and 6ths, with guitar, such like the
songs recorded by Spanish-Californians for Charles Lummis around 1901-1904.... a great many of
his singers seem to have been Indians, but they were not singing for him what we think of as Indian
(tribal) music at all.
AFCCC-POP8-2 http://www.loc.gov/resource/afc1940001.afc1940001_pop8-2
For contrast, to point up what Spanish-Californian music [?] was not, one might give one Indian song
here, and then one true Spanish folksong, recorded by Maria Garcia from the Asturias in Spain, who
ran the restaurant in the First Brick House in California, i Monterey:La Paloma Blanca, a lullaby from
Oviedo.

FOLKSONG IN CALIFORNIAoutline -- 3 --IIMUSIC AMONG CALIFORNIA MINERS, in the Sierra
Nevada
All through the fifties Stephen Foster's popular songs were a reading, and his Camptown Races, Old
Dan Tucker and O Susanna were sung at wagon-train encampments and along the route. Two other
songs, about Lily Dale 'My long lost lily, [Swe?]-eet Lily Dale' and 'Gentle Annie', were recorded for me
as 49--er songs by John McCready of Groveland, a miner whose father was a 49er and had told him
of hearing these two songs rise from one covered wagon or another when he came across the plains
driving an ox-team... These are all easily discoverable in print and need only be mentioned, I think.
Then another son of a 49er sang [?] 3 songs known at Sutter's Fort in the 50's: Her Sweet Sailor
BoyAnother traditional one I forget titleThe Dark-Eyed Sailor -- fine song, much parodied in songsters
An old 49er diary quotes two lines of a song that by good luck I recognized as one of the shaped-
note hymns, one for Easter called the Garden Hymn probably a traditional tune, with religious words
and a singing-school master's harmonization, published in the Southern Harmony in [?] 1835; I also
have a fine recording of it, sung by an old lady at Central Valley, Calif., who had learned it from her
parents and never seen it written down... marvellously beautiful tune and perfectly singable words,
unlike most or those old hymns. So: Garden Hymn
Songs found elsewhere; about the overland trip:Root, Hog or Die (several versions, words changed to
fit various dates and circumstances) about the trip by sea, Humbug Stemship Companies
But one family had an argument and the man finally agreed to stay home: The Stone that Goes
Rolling Will Gather No Moss
Songs about mining: The Days of Forty-NineDigging on the Lode, -- a remarkable song I never heard
of before,could be a Welsh miner's song, requires some digging.
Could amplify this with songs from elsewhere about California miners; they played a lively role for
quite a while in songs, as likely victims of murders and banditry generally -- the fine ballad from
AFCCC-POP8-2 http://www.loc.gov/resource/afc1940001.afc1940001_pop8-2
Missouri about Cole Younger, for example. Prior to 1910 Mrs. Fanny Eckstrom wrote down around
20 miners' songs from California as sung by her father, a returned 49er, and his friends. She wrote
me about this and said I could have them, but I would have to get them from the papers of Phillips
Barry, who died shortly in main after she sent them to him and left all his papers to the Harvard
Library. If I concentrate on this I could probably run then down as I've since made friends with
Barry's literary executors. If they turn out to be good songs -- singable and with real character -- and
not widely known, some, at least should go in here if I can arrange it.
Illegible paragraph 4 FOLKSONG IN CALIFORNIAoutline -- 4 --II, cont'dCALIFORNIA MINERS .......The
paucity of truly traditional songs of fine quality surviving among miners in the Sierra, into the 20th
century, is I think explained by the fact that so much money [?] drew theatrical trouper and all kinds
of expensive and sophisticated entertainment that made musical self-sufficiency unnecessary
musically. Far more stage and minstrel and operatictunes are offered as "old songs" [?] by miners
who are the sons of 49ers, than one finds elsewhere in mountain country among people of the same
generation.STAGE SONGS
How this world was made -- a minstrel song, which requires a little emendation for singing, as the
word "nigger" keeps cropping up; but it is a kind of an amusing and singable song. Also The Cab
Came Back
Songs with accents, burlesquing German or Swedish or Chinese accents or habits, were fashionable
in the mines; those I have include a hair-raising anti-Semitic one -- or at least maybe it is not anti-
Semitic any more than the others are anti-German or anti-Chinese; they just make fun of different
names, different customs, different speech. Unnecessary to reproduce, anyhow!
Gooseberry Pie, a kind of home-grown song for "plays of our own get-up", probably.... makes a good
children's song today!
Bologny Sausage -- same as Gooseberry Pie, although it is widdly Freudian, and the way the singer
sang the last verse makes it clear that he knew understood the symbolsm, to my surprise. It is a
good song, actually, to the tune of Sweet Betsy From Pike, with a fine nonsense refrain. The last
verse could just be omitted, with a footnote. Now, now, now.
This miners' section would have a sort of 20th century part, to include similar songs: traditional
(the Mehrtens family, beautiful English love songs) and later-than-British traditional (Mehrtens and
others) and a couple of late 19th-century drinking songs to fine Irish tunes (Ford family) and a dull
song about a mine from the Mehrtens... perhaps a dozen songs in this group, more than half of
them quite short, all recorded by people [?] who arrived here after about 1890. +12
AFCCC-POP8-2 http://www.loc.gov/resource/afc1940001.afc1940001_pop8-2
I have nothing from any foreign language group from this area but of course there were lots of
Cinese, Italians, Mexicans and Chileans, among others.... passing mention is all I can give them,
however. There is a Chilean harp in the museum at Sutter's Fort, left behind by a Chilean 49er.
Among the later songs from the Sierra should go two recorded by former medecine show men: The
Keeley Cure Dr. Ridge's Food
The whole point of this section is its miscellaneous character, of course! Whether songs [?] are
presented chronologically or by type will have to be decided later. I will list a number of titles with
a phrase or two to illustrate [?] songs not worth printing. I am anxious to give an honest picture of
the musical repertory of a time and place, (which necessarily includes a lot of what both folklorists &
musicians properly consider nonsense--) instead of extracting gems alone

FOLKSONG IN CALIFORNIAoutline - 5 -Music of SEA ISLANDERS WHO HAVE SETTLED AROUND
SAN FRANCISCO BAY AZORE ISLANDS PORTUGUESE
Azore Islanders believe that the first European music to be sung (and danced) on the North
American continent was the Chamarrita -- supposed to have been taught by Cabrillo's men to [?]
friendly Indians on their first shore-leave after Cabrillo discovered California in 1542. Cabrillo was
Portuguese and so were his men, although he claimed California for Spain because he had hired
out to the King and Queen of Spain (my informant's terminology). This bit of music and dance is still
common in California, at every Port. party around SF Bay, Watsonville and Pescadero.The Chamarrita
I have 45 or so fine Portuguese things -- I thought about 10 of them in here, including some
children's games, some adults' dance songs, a song or two for Christmas and for St. John's Day,
and a fado or two (devilish to rite down, however!) These last are dialog or trio or quartet affairs in
which men sing alternately against a string accompaniment; improvising the verses as they go along,
apostrophizing the guitar or the moon or the fado itself as a fine song to sing, or complimenting
or -- sometimes -- insulting one another. [?] San Judo [?] Noite de RoisO LaurentinaAs Carvoeilhas

JUGO -- SLAVSA little dance music on peasant instruments -- bagpipes, lyrics, etc. along with some
[?] chants acc. by the [?], an instrument sacred to The Horse, in the style of the [Homeric?] bards
(apparently authentically Homeric, according to some Harvard men who have spent their lives
studying this music in Serbia.) Quite a thing, and not possible to give any idea of it by writing out the
music; but nice anecdotes and pictures and people... around Cupertino in the Santa Clara Valley --
[?] and apricot orchards and vineyards.ASSYRIANSPictures, beautiful instrument, anecdotes but no
music because the performer was in mourning.. Assyrians, real ones, are rare.PERSIAN3 songs from
a waiter at Larry Blake's [record?] 1954 -- very shy type,[?]
Chanting of old Persian poetry to accompany physical exercises in the gymnasium, same idea as
Walter Camp. If any Persian music survived the destruction of Persian culture by the Arabs, this just
[might?] be it.
Chanting of more recent Persian poetry from the time of Mohammed.
A contemp. song to an old tune: A boy, exiled to an island in the Persian Gulf following recent riots
in Teheran, sings: I was only walking along the street, hand in hand with my girl... why should I be
sent here, separated from her...?BASQUE -- SPANISH NAVARRE2 songs, one about spinning wool.
In the Basque language, Spanish folk-type tunes.Migrants from other/ agriultural parts of the US:
Oklahoma, Indiana, Iowa, Texas, etc mostly from southern Calif: I'm going own this road feeling bad

outline -- 9 --VWOODSMEN and others from the NORTH
FINNSA sailor's drinking song (Finns are sailors not so much because of the neighboring sea as
because the boys left home early to work at whatever a husky kid could, in order to avoid the 3 or
4 year obligatory service in the Russian army) (Plenty of other songs if this [confuser?] the earlier
point! -- but seamen [turned into?] were woodsmen in the hardtimes and New England too actually.)
The brother Murderer -- Finnish [form?] of our British balls! Edward. Isontalen Antti, a fine song to
sing but I forget what it's about! Kesa ilta, lovely lyrical tune.ICELANDICRyma: an old Norse form,
very interesting survival, stanzas traditionally improvised to fit a variety of rigid verse forms... I have
dozens of these... Admiring the snuffbox is a good one.
Contemp. verses: A man trying to get a dog out of the church in Winnipeg. A perfectly serious matter,
not intended to be funny particularly, but rather to criticize the ineptitude...
Boom-fa-la.la-la, wonderful bouncy song.
Lenten hymn. The 12 Apostles, one of a series of Lenten (Protestant) plays, enacted at remote
Icelandic farms still. Sung by Mr. Einarson, a strong man in a circus, with whose father V. Stefansson
boarded the year he lived in Iceland. Another ryma: Home to Iceland, 1930, composed and sung In
Old Icelandic (Norse) by Otto Bardarson, late Superintendent of Schools in Carmel.NORWEGIAN:2
songs from the [?] Islands at the extreme northern tip of Norway. These lead into my Ford family
singers who came to California 1930-40 from the Wisconsin woods.
Songs about Wisconsin lumberjack life, very different from anything in Calif., where lumbering never
depended much on snow and rivers and was merchanized early -- perhaps these belong in some
kind or appendix, or not at all in this book.
AFCCC-POP8-2 http://www.loc.gov/resource/afc1940001.afc1940001_pop8-2
Very fine versions of Derby Ram, King John and the Bishop of Canterbury, Many Questions, Yorkshire
Bite, Rosemary and thyme, the Farmer's Curst Wife, [?] from this family, along with other non-Child
lyrical British songs...almost anything you can name.
Songs about drinking, pro and con.
Songs about bandits, Irish, English and American
War songs, land and sea...Monitor & Merrimac, Custer's Last [?]
I'll have to evolve some kind of principles for selection with these.... I'd say 20 songs, 4 or 5 very long,
16-20 [stanzas?], 10 with 8-10 tanzas. 5 or 6 with 4 stanzas or less.
I have one donkey-jammer's song, to the tune of Casey Jones, from the Yosemite Sugar Pine Lumber
Co.'s camp No. 2 in Tuolumne Co.. not especially imaginative.
The Ford brothers all were loggers in Wisconsin and workers in heavy contruction, road building, etc.,
on the San Gabriel, Boulder, Shasta and 2 other dams.. Grand Coulse and the big one in Idaho. But
no revelant song.
[One?] [construction?] workers' song about SF Bay Bridge, however it 9 outline -- 9 --
So far the book is directed at people who want information about the character of traditional
musical life and/or who like to sing, or who want to use the material to accompany various kinds
of study units. To make it a real handbook of minority-group song in California is not the intention
--- I would have to go far more deeply into the history of each culture than I have done or can do
from New York where I mostly [?] live. Rather I am giving a picture of Calif. now (or as of 10-15 years
ago) in a form that will encourage and make it seem natural for people interested in my Hebrides or
Armenian or Portuguese songs to go to their neighbors to hear them sung and to find more of them,
and get live singers to sing for children in schools, and so....at least, so I hope. The book represents
what is going on just around the corner now, not the past history of some other people --- except
with the mining songs, the emphasis is not on survivals.
I do not expect to provide English translations in poetic form for singing, either, as the songs lend
themselves [?] different differently [to?] adaptation to the translation problem: Some can be sung in
the original language, perhas; or joining in the chorus with the recording; an occasional one might
have singable English words, but if so it would be an accident. But there would of course always be a
general outline of the subject of the text. And also a note on the moment in the development of the
AFCCC-POP8-2 http://www.loc.gov/resource/afc1940001.afc1940001_pop8-2
history of music represented by a given piece, perhaps -- briefly, and leaning heavily on information
from my husband!
I an inclined to feel that in this form the book will feel thin, in a certain way, the treatment of the
foreign music will necessarily be superficial; yet, [?] is a collection from California, of all states, would
seem superficial in another way. So I thought of making the following [bows?] to conventional
folklerists' procedure; this would depend on the length of earlier chapters, however.VI
A chapter on Child ballads found in Calif...a descriptive list for the most part, but giving in full 6 or
8 of the best ones, perhaps, and omitting them from earlier chapters entirely. (They would mostly
come in, if used earlier, among the Ford family songs in Chapter V, but they are unnecessary really,
as the Fords can provide plenty of others, and so can Mr. Graham, another prolific source of fine
though fantastically garbled Child items.) Two of these turned up among Barbary Coast dance hall
entertainers; one version, [?] among several, of the Derby Ram is as wildly bawdy as anything I ever
heard, but probably not unprintable, as the singer never uses the 4-letter word, only given the clue
to it in the [rhytme?], so the audience roars it out while he goes on innocently into the refrain.
