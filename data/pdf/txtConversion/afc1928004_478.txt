FIRDER, 24 Vesey Bt., N. Y 
FOf fun, for sport and merriment, 
After working hard all day-, 
Go down to the Battery, that's the place 
To drive dull care away. 
They have a 
band of music there, 
Where the boys and girls have a 
lark, 
It's better than Newport or Long Branch, 
The dance at Battery Park. 
CHORUS. 
You'd split your sides a 
laughing 
To hear Crook's Concert Band, 
The boys play concertina's, 
And the girls they look so grand; 
They dance around like fairies, 
And then commence to spark, 
It's better than Newport or Long Branch, 
The dance at Battery Park. 
You never saw such a 
happier lot 
In the course of all your life, 
Young men of twenty with their girls, 
The working man and his wife. 
They're happy as if they were kings and queens, 
They're bound to have a 
lark, 
Would set you wild, the music would, 
The dance at Battery Park. 
(Chorus.) 
All classes are represented there 
Every Tuesday and Friday nights, 
The best of order is maintained 
And not a 
single fight. 
It is always crowded, yes, 
From six till after dark, 
The pivoters and spielers are always there, 
To dance at Battery Park, 
(Chorus.)

Widow's Grocery Store. 
Written, composed anal sung by J. E. M URPHY, of M URPHY 31, M ACK, amid 
roars of laughter. 
Copyrighted, 1879, by A. J. FISHER, 24 limy St., N.Y. 
A 
neat and tidy widow 
By the name of Mrs. McCune 
Keeps a 
shebeen in Mott street, 
Among the neighbors she's well known, 
She sells coal, wood and candies, 
Pickles, cakes and pies, 
And keeps a 
bottle of the best, 
To sell the neighbors on the sly. 
CHORUS. 
There's all of Ryan's family, 
Muldoon and Mike McGuire, 
They smoke the widow's three-cent segars, 
And sing around the fire; 
Take a 
glass of whiskey then 
Smack their lips and say, 
We'd die for the want of a 
drink 
If the widow would move away. 
The woman come to gossip 
The price of taffy candy, 
They buy a 
box of matches then, 
Or a 
cup of the widow's brandy; 
They talk about old Ireland, 
Like glue together they stick, 
She has a 
sign in the window saying— 
Please don't ask for tick. 
(Chorus.)

Sung by J. E. M URPHY, of Min-trill- k M ACK, for seventy-five consecutive 
nights at the London Theatre, N. Y., in their groat sketch, 
" 
The Christening." 
Our club is always noted for its larking and sparkin' 
Such dancin' and singin' and jolly sport have we; 
Our picnics bate them all without denial, a 
trial 
Would set you wild with pleasure at the Twilight Coterie. 
It's dance and prance, and catch the motion easy, 
And in a 
whirl, swing your girl, now we're off in style 
you see. 
And still the fiddle and the horns are soundin' while 
boundin' 
Are all the merry spielers of the Twilight Coterie. 
CHORUS. 
) 
Then it's on a 
summer's night in the park, my boys, 
j 
Where the merry girls are singin' light and free, 
Hands around and round, and round, oh! what a 
lark, my 
boys, 
flow the spielers prance, at the moonlight dance, of the 
Twilight Coterie. 
There's honored delegations from the " Starlights" and 
"Skylights," 
The " Ours" and " Yours" and other coteries, 
Together with their friends and their ladies, the daisies, 
Invited guest whose hearts are blessed with all the beer 
they please; 
It's skip and dip, and sachez round in glory, 
Oh, Kate asthore I 
bang the floor, that's the style of girl 
for me, 
And so around we balance, and each daisy is crazy 
Wid great hilarity, all at the Twilight Coterie. 
(Chorus.)

229 Bowery and 
sent to any address, post-paid, on receipt or 35 cents. 
Now list ye to my classic lay, 
Politely hearken loudly, while 
I 
sing of Levi Kassiday, 
A 
blazing star of solid style; 
From Coney Isle to Zululand, 
From sweet Cohohohoes to Newfoundland, 
Roam where you will a 
man you'll never find 
Like Levi Kassiday. 
CHORUS. 
For he's a 
man, understan, wid a 
very fine eye for a 
nica 
young girl, 
And a 
primo judge of Dublin wine, 
And creamy cream of the style, do you mind, 
Wid a 
rose like his nose, 
Of a 
color as bright as the red blue say, 
Oh, it's on the street, there's few you'll meet 
Like Levi Kassiday. 
A- down the street with stately tread, 
And style that dislocates them all, 
Meanders he, enveloped in 
A brand new fresh spring suit of gaul; 
Upon his arm hangs Julia Ann, 
Sweet lady bird of this daisy man, 
A Don Juhannes in his mind is he, 
This Levi Kassiday. 
(Chorus.) 
When voices sweet were handed round, 
Levi was not behind the door, 
An over strung bass voice has he, 
He sang the ' mast " in " Pinafore" 
From Asiah to Kalamazu, 
From Canadaw to San Franciseu, 
Another one of it you'll seldom meet 
Like Levi Kassday. 
(Chorus.)

Last Wednesday I 
attended 
A 
raffle for a 
stove, 
In aid of the wife and family 
Of Timothy J. Cosgrove. 
Kellys, Hogans, and O'Briens, 
All came in a 
drove, 
To take the dice and shake them nice, 
And try and win the stove. 
CHORUS. 
Forward four, allaman left, while the music it did play, 
'Twas grand delight to see the sight of those Irishmen so 
gay, 
I 
never laughed so hearty in the course of all my life 
Looking at Plug McCarty, pivotin' with his wife. 
At nine o'clock precisely 
The raffling it begun, 
Tom Kelly he jumped ten foot high 
When sixty-four was flung; 
O'Brien yelled out murder, 
With a 
brick his eye was closed; 
On that night I 
had to fight, 
While raffling for the stove. 
(Chorus.) 
At six o'cicck in the morning 
The raffling it was o'er, 
Tom Kelly he got staving drunk 
And stole away the door; 
Clancy with a 
bottle, 
Sure lie all the windows broke; 
Cosgrove grabbed him by the neck, 
And boys, I 
thought he'd choke. 
(Chorus.)

But now her high tuned monnygram 
Is Bid alia Jane McCann. 
CHORUS. 
I3idalia Jane McCann, the elegant Miss McCann,

That can bate the bon-ton of Bidalia Jane McCann.

I

Might help your fatigu."

She gives a " German" every week, 
And " Irish" too as well,

She talks French like a

She's very aurevoir indeed, 
Is Bedelia Jane McCann.

When I 
landed at Castle Garden, 
About ten years ago, 
I 
made my home in a 
tenement house, 
In Cherry street below, 
'Twas there I 
got acquainted 
Wid a 
German girl so gay, 
It was only six months after, 
She named my wedding day. 
CHORUS. 
Ring a 
wreath of roses, 
We'll ring a 
wreath for thee, 
All the little children, 
Sang so sweet to me; 
Ladies came in carriages, 
With presents and boquets, 
To little Michael Callihan, 
Upon his wedding day. 
It was on a 
Saturday evening, 
With laugh and merry shout, 
The boys and girls in the neighborhood, 
So gaily did turn out ; 
The old folks dressed their very best, 
And had funny things to say 
To Mike and Lena Callihan, 
Upon their wedding day. 
(Chorus.) 
There was August Schmitt and Kunkle, 
And Henry Ciselmyer, 
With all my wife's relations, 
And Cohn the old clothes buyer. 
My brothers Pat and Danny, 
Wid the ladies danced the glide, 
But the Germans tried to kill them when 
They tried to kiss the bride.

I 
Married Biddy McCarthy. 
Composed by Ned Talbot for J. E. Murphy, of Murphy & Mack. 
I 
went down to Goer& street 
To a 
nice little surprise party, 
And the charmer that I 
met there was 
The darling, Biddy McCarthy. 
Now Biddy was the finest girl, 
And the amusement of the party, 
Says I, I'm surely dead in love 
With the darling, Biddy McCarthy. 
CHORUS. 
With me tra-la-lee, now don't you see, 
I'm gone on Biddy McCarthy. 
(Repeat.) 
We danced the polka " mazourka," 
Likewise the dizzy lanciers, 
And as we moved around the floor 
We were two darling dancers. 
Says Biddy, sure I 
feel afraid 
That I'll have to shake the party, 
I 
says wait awhile until I 
smile, 
And I'll go home with you Biddy McCarthy. 
(Chorus.) 
As I 
went home to Biddy's house 
A 
laughing, talking, chatting, 
I 
met her father at the door 
All out of breath a 
panting. 
Says he, now Biddy where did you get this, 
Did you get him at the party, 
Oh, yes, you honor was the reply 
From darling Biddy McCarthy. 
(Chorus.) 
I 
am happy now, I 
have a 
cow, 
Likewise a 
pig and a 
daughter, 
I 
live in a 
cot in a 
shady spot 
Away across the water. 
My mother-in-law she calls on me, 
She is a 
roaring tartar, 
Her husband as well is like a 
bull, 
But I 
love my Biddy McCarthy. 
(Chorus.) 
The Villain Still Pursued Her. 
Words and Music by TIM ROGERS, and sung by him with great suocess 
at the Front Street Theatre, Baltimore, Md. 
Ill sing about a 
beauty, 
Who in Irish town doeE dwell, 
With her father and mother 
In a 
boarding-house hotel. 
There is a 
villain wanted to marry her, 
Before he ever knew her; 
She left her home and run away, 
And the villain still pursued her. 
This girl she left her home, 
Likewise her native place , 
One day while walking through the park, 
Sh, met the villain face to face. 
IL, grasped her by the lily white hand, 
And he popped the question to her, 
She seized the tongs and wrenched his breath, 
And the villain still pursued her. 
She travelled on for miles, at last she drew a 
pop. 
And shot him four times through the heart; 
And still he would not stop, she drew a 
sword 
And cut him right and left when he came to her, 
She killed him dead and away she went, 
And the villain still pursued her.

As sung at Tony Pastor's Opera House. New York, by MILES MoPar 
I'M a

With the turn of the wrist me stick I

colleen's smile, 
With the love of me heart for them I'd part, and many: an

But I've just dropt in to tell ye's all the places I 
h&Vi

And all the very funny sights in me travels I

And in Germany I've been, now you musn't think nsc

And pretzels strong and sausages long, a

Where the men they make the women work, and the sol-

THE O'GR ADYS. 
ORIGINAL SONG. 
Words by HARRY BENNETT. 
Sung by the PEASLEYS, Joint 
and LEA. 
Good evening to you, gents and ladies, 
We've come hero to make a 
call, 
Descendants of the great O'Gradys, 
The best you'll find in Donegal. 
A 
year ago we took the notion 
To sail across the briny deep. 
The sea was in a 
great commotion, 
We could not get a 
wink of sleep. 
CHORUS. 
They call us now the great O'Gradys, 
We'll fight till we're pushed to the wall, 
The young folks they were all a 
crying, 
The day we left ould Donegal. 
We were known throughout the country; 
The devil the one with us could dance, 
We were the first in every motion, and drink 
Whenever we had the chance. 
We used to drive the girls all crazy, 
So nimbly we could shake our feet; 
They never found us slow or lazy, 
At dancing we could not be beat. 
They call us, etc.

MY MARY ANN. 
Written for Miss KITTIE O'NEIL, by ED. HARRIGAN. 
On! My Mary Ann is an artizan, 
In a 
factory 'way down town ; 
She makes umbrellas for the high-toned fellers, 
And she lives six stories from the ground, 
In a 
brick tenement, where they cut up devilment 
Every night In the week and every day. 
My sweet Mary Ann walks out upon tile sand. 
Ev'ry summer at Rockaway. 
Her big brother Dan is a 
laboring man, 
On the pipes he's a 
civil engineer; 
His feet are as large as a 
picnic barge, 
He wears gum drops in his ears, 
He has a 
voice like a 
thrush, and he feeds on mush, 
He's fond of his sister, they say. 
Sweet Mary Ann walks out upon the sand, 
With her big brother Dan at Rockaway. 
Sweet Mary Ann plays the grand pian, 
She never studied notes from the book, 
The music clear lays all in her ear, 
As she rattles it off with her hands. 
Sunday night, when the parlor's full, 
And dear Camelia May will you give me a 
welcome here? 
Then sweet Mary Ann walks out upon the sand, 
Every summer on the beach at Rockaway.

My Pretty Little Sweet Blush Rose. 
SONG AND DANCE. 
As sung by the FRENCH TWIN SISTERS. 
Words by GEORGE COOPER. 
Music by H. N. 
SAWYER. 
Oh, skies were bright and blue, 
And merry little robins were a-singing; 
I 
strolled the garden through, 
Where butterflies were gaily winging; 
The breath of fragrant dew 
Each balmy breeze of summer time was bringing. 
can't forget how first I 
met 
My pretty little sweet blush rose ; 
[Repeat last two lines.] 
CHORUS. 
Where sunbeams dance, ( Break.) 
Shyly stealing glances, ( Break.) 
Weaving fairy fancies, ( Break.) 
Oh, in this heart she blooms and grows, 
My pretty little sweet blush rose. 
The flow'rets peeped around, 
All nodding to their queen a 
merry greeting; 
A 
lovely bower we found, 
Where lily bells so fair were meetin; 
A 
voice of silvery sound 
Its tender little promise was repeating, 
How two lips met, can you forget, 
My pretty little sweet blush rose ? 
[Repeat last two lines,then Chorus.] 
Bright stars were in the sky, 
And roses in their silv -ry light were sleeping; 
The day had glided by, 
We thought the jealous hours were creeping; 
We parted with a 
sigh, 
Oh, ever in my heart my rose I'm keeping, 
Yes, stars will set ere I 
forget 
My pretty little sweet blush rose.

CAPTAIN CUFF. 
As sung by W M. SCANLAN, with great success. 
Some folks go in for whiskey, 
Some for most unpleasant dogs; 
Some fellows have a 
fancy 
For the most outrageous togs. 
I'm very gone on linen, yes, 
And wouldn't give a 
dollar 
For life, without a 
splendid show 
Of snow-white cuff and collar. 
SPOREN.—Yes, ladies and gentleman, for my great desire for 
linen, I 
have achieved the great and glorious title of— 
CHORUS. 
Captain Cuff 
Captain Cuff! 
You can tell me by my collar; 
Captain Cuff, Captain Cuff, 
Though I'm not worth one half dollar; 
I'm awfully stiff in style, 
My cigarette I'll puff; 
Then hi I 
hi I 
clear the way, 
Here comes Captain Cuff. 
Sometimes a 
common fellow 
Of the lower order class, 
Will dare make some rude remark, 
Or mock me when I 
pass. 
And lots of vulgar little boys, 
They know me well enough, 
And oft salute me as I 
pass, 
With what cheer, Captain Cuff. 
Captain Cuff, etc. 
With darling eyes upon me, 
Through life I 
gaily march. 
My style shall be the stiffest; 
My motto shall be starch. 
Should my cuff and collar glory, 
Be ever gone and fled, 
You'll know that Captain Cuff's gone wrong, 
And his washerwoman's dead. 
Captain Cuff, etc. 
Biddy Muldoon. 
As sung with great success by DAN COWIE% 
Now, Biddy, I 
see you a-peepin' so sly, 
The stars are a-looking from out of the sky, 
The nightingale warbles his purtiest tune, 
He knows I 
am lovin' you, Biddy Muldoon. 
The grass it is wet, and I'm catchin' a 
cold, 
And, Biddy, now don't you be thinking me bold, 
Just open the dure and I'll go away soon, 
For I'm crazy wid love of you, Biddy Muldoon. 
CHORUS. 
Biddy, Biddy, Biddy Muldoon, 
Open the window and look at the moon; 
I'd knock any man in the middle of June, 
If I 
caught him a 
courtin' you, Biddy Muldoon. 
Now, Biddy, my darlin, you're laughing, I'm sure, 
Oh come down, my jewel, and open the dure; 
Would you let a 
man fraze, on an evenin' in June, 
When you could revive him, dear Biddy Muldoon. 
If the old man's await:, bless the name that he bears, 
He'd think it's a 
rat, that is stealing up stairs; 
'Twould be a 
good joke on the swate old gossoon, 
For he won't know I'm courtin' you, Biddy Muldoon:

No doubt you will wcnder why I 
dress so gay, 
Always in fashion this swell of the day. 
My clothes they are cut in the latest of style, 
And the darling young ladies on me fondly smile. 
My way is so winning, full of exquisite grace, 
Why they really do laugh when we meet face to face. 
The gents they all look with derision at me, 
Because I 
am always dressed up to a 
T.

At sweet Saratoga or Far Rockaway. 
Oh

Dn a 
nice afternoon if the weather is fair, 
To my barber's I 
go to curl up my hair, 
Brush off my clothes fix myself all serene, 
For I 
always endeavor to look bright and clean. 
I 
am a 
good hand at billiards and like my good wine, 
A

I 
never borrow trouble, always feel well, 
And a

Then to the sea-
beach in summer I'll go, 
Cut such a

There in the ball-room to promenade and dance, 
With any young lady I 
meet there by chance.

Two barges and a

Up at Dudley Grove. 
I

In the waltz how gay I'd wheel her, 
No pivoter could equal her, 
A

And as we'd spin around 
They'd say, " Ain't she a

The Policeman. 
Written and composed by DAN Cot.',veil. 
A 
song for the guards of the city, 
The men who are gallant and true; 
Their praises I 
sing in this ditty— 
The stalwart, the brave men in blue. 
They never will swerve from their duty, 
But danger they keep from our doors, 
The gallant protectors of beauty, 
The shield of our rights and our laws. 
CHORUS. 
Then, hurrah! for the guards of the city, 
The men who are gallant ond true; 
Their praises we sing in this ditty— 
Hurrah! for the brave men in blue. 
When stealthily, under night's cover, 
The house-breaker creeps to your door, 
And thinks that he'll pick a 
fat plover 
While the inmates in sweet slumber snore, 
The night guardian strikes him with wonder, 
For, just as he's bagging his game, 
The arm of the law grabs the plunder 
And the robber is brought to his shame. 
Then, hurrah, &c. 
Then, long life to the gallant battalion, 
The marshal, the captains, and all, 
The terror of thief and rascallion, 
And willing to answer the call. 
When danger's at hand, they are ready 
To rush to the front and to shield; 
Stout hearts, with a 
step firm and steady, 
Will soon di-ive the foe from the field. 
Then hurrah, &c. 
NORAH IS DREAMING OF YOU! 
As Sung by ALICE MuaRA.T, in their Sketch Terry's Return. 
Sweetly, the stars up above us are dreaming, 
The birds they are dreaming of morn ; 
Sad is the moon, though in radiance beaming, 
She is dreaming, alone and forlorn ; 
Roses and lilies, so gentle and loving, 
Are dreaming, I 
know, in the dew ; 
So, when afar you are thoughtlessly roving, 
Your Norah is dreaming of you. 
Still I 
am waiting, so sadly and lonely, 
0, tell me, if still you are true? 
Dream of me, darling, for one moment, 
While Norah, your Norah, is dreaming of you. 
Thu' you forget me, when far you are roaming, 
I 
shall not believe it, my. 
own ; 
Don't you remember , you said in the gloaming, 
That I 
was your darling, alone ? 
Come to my heart, like a 
bird that is weary, 
0 
come to your Norah so true; 
Linger not long, for the days they are dreary, 
While Norah is dreaming of you. 
Still I 
am waiting, so sadly and lonely, 
0, tell me, if still you are true ; 
Dream of me, darling, for one moment only, 
For Norah, your Norah, is dreaming of you.

OWEN REILLY. 
Sung by JOHN SHEEHAN. 
Oh, my name is Owen Reilly, 
I've got a 
son that's got me crazy, 
He comes home every night wid his blackguard songs, 
lie said he learned them up at some free and aisy; 
He wanted his mother for to put on the boxing gloves wid hitn, 
He broke his little brother's leg wid a 
poker, 
lie have an old deck of cards, and he wants me to play 
Pedro, Sancho, Seven-up and the Joker. 
He says he's taking sparring lessons from Professor John 
Donovan, 
He bate the oldest boy of cross-eyed McGarrity-, 
lie goes prancing around all the dances of the city, 
And he have a 
girl who do be dancing at the vulgarities. 
Oh, he pawned me Sunday pants last week, 
To go and lay a 
wager, 
And he brought me down the street that night, 
For to fight a 
big black nagur; 
There's his cousin Mike, a 
nice young man, 
Wid the finest kind of manners, 
Night after night they roamed about, 
And they called it carrying the banners. 
But the two of them got in a 
scrape, 
They stole a 
Dutchman's pony, 
Poor Mike is in the workhouse now, 
And Bernard's in Aronagonia. 
Oh, he tied a 
can to our dog's tail, 
When we'd gone to church last Sunday, 
lie got stiff staving tight, and stayed out that night, 
And he was up before the judge in the morning; 
lie have the house turned inside out, 
He's gone to the bad intirely, 
Be heavens I 
fear that he'll be hung, 
God help you, Bernard Reilly. 
He kicked his sister, Honorah in the forehead last week, 
He wanted custard pie for his supper; 
And he came home wid himself stuffed wid boiled oyster stews,, 
And threw the corn beef and cabbage in the gutter.

AIR.—Slavery Days. 
FATHER. 
DEAR isle of fame and beauty, thy shores have long been trod 
With savage tyrants' footsteps! 
Oh, 'tis sad 
Thy faithful sons, dear Erin, are banished from thy sod, 
Their homes destroyed, they are dispossessed of all I 
We leave the dear old cottage that once we called our own; 
The cursed intruders' minds are satisfied! 
They have caused the young to exile and the old to be forlorn 
On the roadside here we lay our heads to die I

DAUGHTER. 
Oh, father, dearest father, you are growing old, I 
see, 
. . 
You cannot do that work there all alone, 
And when I 
marry Teddy, oh, father, he will be 
A 
great help on the farm and in our home. 
His heart is stout and bold, the cares of life will not wear 
A 
haggard look upon my darling Ted. 
Can I 
be his wife now, father ? for to me he is so fair; 
Your refusal, father dear, I 
almost dread! 
FATHER. 
Oh, Norah, with a 
blessing I 
hope the sunshine's rays 
May ever shine upon you and your Ted; 
I 
hope you'll thrive and prosper like the blooming flowers in 
May; 
You'll remember this, my blessing, when I'm dead. 
Go tell the news to Teddy, that your father gave consent, 
And tell him that he is free to name the day; 
But let him seek another land, for he cannot earn the rent! 
Sure, he'll find a 
home in dear America.

To fresco the alley, and whitewash the yard.

had him here, 
I 
would play seven-up on the edge of his ear.

FRINGE ON HIS PANTS. 
Sung by Andy Collura. 
t 
Ars I 
was coming down Broadway to- day, 
Tbe boot-blacks on the corner at leisure did play, 
They all looked up and saw me by chance, 
Cried one stag the gauk he's got fringo on his pants, 
I 
took my girl to the ball lant night, 
The gang on the floor commenced for to fight, 
My daisy got drunk and they slugged her by chance, 
For mashing a 
sue who had tar on his pants. 
Now all you young blokes take a 
warning from me, 
oh, never get married how sorry you'll be, 
You'll go to the parks and you will meet them by chance, 
But beware of the daisy who wears fringe on her over-ails.

Oh, I'm in love with all the girls, 
The short, the lean, and tall, 
And I 
know that they are gone on me, 
For after me they call: 
There goes the beau ideal of man, 
I 
wish he'd come this way ; 
But I 
surprise them all, indeed, 
When this to them I 
say— 
CHORUS. 
Get thee gone, you naughty girls, 
I'll strike you with my stick ; 
If ever I 
blow my breath on you, 
I'll make you fearful sick. 
Your mamma she won't know you 
When you go home to hash, 
So keep away from me, I 
say, 
For I'm not on the mash. 
One young girl, she loved me so, 
She wanted me to elope ; 
One hundred thousand dollars had she, 
While my poor bank was broke.

That I

Yourself or money I

I 
am in love with a 
bouncing fat girl, 
Who is known all over creation ; 
She beats the life out of Harrigan's Mary Ann, 
Or Dr. Landis for a 
good education, 
A 
masher she is called on the street, 
In the " Black Crook " she does the statue,; ; 
But lately she has canceled all dates, 
And is off her nut on walking matches. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, her front name she says it is Mary, 
And she is a 
bouncing fat fairy. 
It is no use to talk, she's a 
daisy to walk, 
She has the score-board all marked with long streaks of chalk. 
As around on the track she goes creeping, 
And time to the music keeps beating, 
The men they all shout, " Give it up, you're too stout !" 
But Mary sticks out to the finis. 
Next Monday night she starts out 
To try and beat Harriman and Ennis, 
And if they don't do better than before, 
I'm sure that their names will be Dennis. 
Next season she goes out with me, 
Then I'll be as proud as a 
lord. 
No danger of my trunk's getting stuck, 
For Mary'll walk off with the board. 
Oh, her front name, &c.

Of what McMullen intends to do when he's there in Wash ,

I'll raise the laborers' wages, politicians' I'll reduce, 
Soap and sugar I'll give away, and all kinds of produce; 
All Chinese must emigrate, and go back home again, 
And when I'm there in Washington I'll stick to Senator Blaine, 
I'll give you my idea, & c. 
No crooked men in office, stelling money from the poor, 
Politicians will have no graft, or any sinecure ; 
The world will be rejoicing, and my friends will propagate, 
And they'll all find money in the street when McMullen rules 
the State.

We're both Irish boys, from the crowns of our hats, 
And old Ireland is the land we were born in. 
CrioRus. 
7,‘or we're the boys the shillelah to whack. ( Break.) 
All over Cork county, to Limerick and back, 
We're known as the wild Irish rovers. 
We traveled to Connaught, from that to Tyrone, 
And we walked all the way to the bridge of Athlone; 
Through Dublin and Kerry and Wexford alone, 
We roamed all around through the clover. 
We sailed over to E 
ranee., from that into Spain, 
And we're going to America by the next train ; 
So we'll bid you good-bye, but we'll come back again, 
And we'll still be the wild Trish rovers. 
For we're the boys, & c.

The Way We March. 
Original words and music by JOHN E. 
MURPHY, and sung by MURPHY 
and MACK. 
Good-evening to you, one and all, 
We ask your kind attention ; 
The subject of our song ' tis one 
To you all now we'll make mention. 
It's about a 
day that's not far away, 
Though it comes but once a 
year, 
That's the time we'll all feel gay, 
On St. Patrick's Day in the morning. 
CHORUS. 
The bands will play, and the fifes will play, 
As down Broadway we'll march away ; 
That's the time we'll all feel gay, 
On St. Patrick's Day in the morning. 
Now if on that day we should Meet, 
We hope you won't get offended, 
For what we say and do that day 
It never was intended. 
When we march out we know what we're about, 
That's the time the boys will shout; 
And before it's night we are kicked out 
Of the barrooms in the city. 
The bands will play, & c. 
We learned our marching in the war, 
We fought with George McClellan ; 
We was high private in the rear, 
This is the truth we're telling. 
And when we're out upon parade, 
We throw all others in the shade ; 
We march along in the Fenian Brigade, 
On St. Patrick's Day in the morning. 
The bands will play, & c.

The Two McMullens. 
Original words and music by JOHN E. 
MURPHY, and sung by MURPHY 
and MACK. 
We are the two McMullens, 
As ye all do know, 
A 
little Irish dancing 
To ye we're going to show. 
We landed in this country 
Just fifteen years ago, 
And for making money 
You bet we are not slow. 
CHORUS, 
It was in the garden I 
met you, darling, 
Where the shamrock grows, 
It was there you stole my heart, dear Barney, 
Just twenty years ago. 
Is that so ? 
It is so. 
Oh yes, it is so. 
Is that so ? 
It is so. 
Oh yes, it is so. 
So now we're going to leave you, 
We bid you all farewell, 
And of us two McMullens 
We hope you will speak well. 
We have to toil and labor 
Our apples for to sell, 
And when he gets elected 
To you he'll quickly tell. 
It was in the garden, 8ce.

The Man that Stole the Country. 
Written by FRANK E. 
Alc.NIsn, expressly for MURPHY and MAcx. 
We'll tell you of a 
terrible thief, 
Who for stealing things could not be beat. 
He'd even steal the grub he'd eat, 
The man that stole the country. 
In his sleep he'd dream of what he'd done, 
And when he'd awake, the son of a 
gun. 
He'd get up and go out and steal for fun, 
The man that stole the country. 
CHORUS. 
He stole a 
horse, he stole a 
cow, 
A 
stack of hay and a 
cast-iron plow. 
He swiped a 
dog most dead with old age, 
A whole row of footlights off from a 
stage. 
Last night he came in this very place, 
And took the nose right off a 
man's face. 
All kinds of fish, from a 
whale to a 
perch, 
Even the steeple of Trinity Church. 
A 
pile of timber, a 
liberty pole, 
Stewart's body he must have stole. 
He was bred of a 
family of very bad rank, 
He stole all the bonds in Manhattan Bank, 
The Elevated Road he would have got 
If it hadn't been riveted to the spot. 
He'd steal the tongue out of your mouth 
While you would be talking; 
He stole the shoes off O'Leary 
While he was a 
walking. 
He stole a 
mule that was dying with cramps, 
Then went out West and collared all tramps ; 
Into a 
shop and sneaked out the boss, 
Over to Philadelphia and nipped Charlie Ross. 
In Gilmore's Garden he collared the track, 
He even tried to steal Murphy and Mack, 
THE MAN THAT STOLE THE COUNTRY. 
Continued. 
And still he wasn't satisfied— 
The man that stole the country. 
To Blackwell's Island he was sent, 
And life- time given to repent 
For things he'd done with bad intent— 
The man that stole the country. 
But the villain he was very bold, 
And prison walls could not him hold, 
And he's around again, so we're told— 
The man that stole the country. 
CHORUS. 
41 
A 
pair of boots a 
tub, and a 
saw, 
The wonderful man with the cast-iron jaw. 
A full brass band, and a 
new piano, 
The ballot boxes in Louisiana. 
President Hayes' ulster and beaver, 
Went to New Orleans and took the fever ; 
Came to New York to steal Hell Gate, 
And he'd had it, too, if he hadn't been late. 
He stole a 
whole gang that were out on a 
lark, 
If he hadn't been watched he'd had Central Park. 
Stole a 
street car, the driver and all, 
Then went up and took Tammany Hall. 
Took a 
cop right off from his beat, 
Stole all the bears there were in Wall street. 
To steal the City Hall he often did wish, 
He took the false teeth away from McNish. 
He stole a 
house they had just finished building, 
Took Bessie Turner from Theodore Tilton. 
Into a 
school and nipped the teacher, 
He'd had Elizabeth, too, if it wasn't for Beecher. 
Stole some young folks that were playing backgammon, 
Went to the London and stole Murphy and Shannon, 
And still he was not satisfied— 
The inan that stole the country.

I 
know you'll have pity 
When you hear what I 
say, 
The way I've been treated 
By the blackguards each day, 
Who stand around the corners 
As I 
pass them by; 
You can hear them say plainly, 
Arrah, stag the old guy. 
CHORUS. 
For they yell out, you terrier, 
Go shoot that hat quick. 
For they call me a 
chaw 
And a 
flannel mouth Mick. 
The other day, while out walking, 
I 
went down the street, 
A 
charming young damsel 
I 
did chance to meet. 
Says I, you look charming, 
A cushla ma vick; 
Says she, go drop on yourself, 
You ould flannel mouth Mick. 
For they yell out, &c. 
When election day comes 
Shure I 
know what they'll say, 
It will be, Mr. McGinnis, 
How are you to•day ? 
They'll hand me a 
ticket, 
Say, go vote it now, quick. 
I'm a 
gentleman then, 
And no flannel mouth Mick. 
For they yell out, &c.

About three miles from here, 
There lives a 
pretty Irish queen, 
To me she does prove dear. 
Her mother takes in washing, 
And the girl helps at the trade, 
And when I've called upon her 
These words I've often said : 
CHORUS. 
Mary Ann McLaughlin, don't you cry, 
Take that apron from your eye ; 
Don't you let the neighbors hear you sigh, 
And we'll be married by-and-by. 
Now soon I'm going to married be, 
Of course I'll settle down ; 
I'll buy a 
house, also a 
farm, 
A short way out of town. 
Oh, then it will be joyful, 
\Vhen as cosy as a 
mouse; 
To see the young O'Malleys 
Play tag around the house.

I

When we're out for a

As we pass them by in the street, 
Look at Lynch and his mash, don't they cut a 
dash, 
Don't his darling look charming and sweet. 
CHORUS. 
But you should see Delia 
When on the trapeze, 
She'll stand on her head 
And she'll fall on her knees, 
She is a

Kind friends just listen now to us, 
And we'll sing to you a

And tell you of our youthful days, 
When we were in our prime. 
We're getting old, yes very old, 
And soon must pass away, 
We've traveled on life's weary road, 
With spirits always gay.

Old Mr. and Mrs. Malone, 
A 
jollier old pair you'll seldom find—

'Tis now some sixty years ago 
Since we first joined our lot, 
And in that time there's nothing wrong 
Transpired in our cot. 
We've had our share of sunshine, 
And of course we can't complain; 
Them good old days that's passed and gone, 
Can never come back again.

Why Did My Josie Go ? 
Written by Wm. J. ScAlrurs, of ScAlmozi & Cnotini. 
I 
went up to Barnum's a 
short time ago, 
The circus of course there to see, 
The evening being fine and to spend a 
nice time, 
I 
brought my dear Josie with me. 
She seemed so delighted it made me feel good, 
My heart with joy it did beat, 
And when it was over we started to go 
From the circus out into the street. 
Oh, my! wasn't it fine, 
Oh, how the riders did shine, 
The clown he was laughing, talking and chaffing, 
My little Josie she laughed all the time. 
Last night when we reached my dear Josie's home, 
She said, now don't think me a 
bore 
If I 
ask you to call here again to-morrow night, 
To the circus we'll go just once more. 
My answer was yes, of course, my dear Joe, 
What e'er your request it may be, 
I'll grant it, ray love, if it lies in my power, 
For my love it is always with thee. 
Next evening again to the circus we went, 
My Josie she looked like a 
queen, 
When the riders came out they all looked at her, 
She very much embarassed did seem, 
But, alas! she cried out to the man in the ring, 
My darling, I'm waiting for thee, 
She jumped from my side to my great surprise, 
And every one there laughed at me. 
CHORUS. 
(Chorus.) 
Oh, my! why did she go ? 
Oh, why did she treat me so, 
She was my darling, always so charming, 
None in this world like my own little Joe.

As sung with 
great success all over the country by Tim ROGERS. 
I'VE got a 
donkey, he stands six foot high, 
I'll sell to the man that wishes to buy. 
He drinks Seltzer Water whenever he's dry, 
In a 
race on the turf he has never proved shy; 
He makes good time—about one mile a 
day. 
I'll match him again any stallion or bay. 
lie fought for his country, he's been through the war; 
I 
feed him on herrings, hay, rope, and tar. 
I've got a 
donkey, he's not very chunky, 
I'll trade for a 
monkey, to any old flunkey, 
Now wouldn't that be bunky, if he had my donkey, 
And I 
had his monkey, my donkey also ? 
If he's locked in the stable he'll make a 
stiff kick; 
If he wants to get out he'll pretend he is sick; 
I 
call out my donkey—his name it is Dick. 
I 
coax him along with a 
hickory stick. 
If I 
leave in his box a 
big bale of hay, 
He'll eat it all up and leave none for next day. 
Last week he broke loose, and he got astray; 
He was found in a 
sewer in Avenue A. 
I've got a 
donkey, etc. 
I 
harnessed him up last St. Patrick's day, 
I 
rode on his back so cheerful and gay, 
We started from the corner of Tenth and Broadway, 
We rode to the hall, without any delay. 
Just as we were passing by Central Park, 
A 
boy fired a 
pistol off, just for a 
lark, 
The donkey fell down, which caused a 
blockade, 
Only for Afty horse•doctors he'd spoil the parade.

Jerry Slattery was a 
tailor, he was ninety years of age, 
He had a 
son named Micky, a 
play actor on the stage. 
He'd play Romeo with his sister, for diamonds he'd give her 
pork and beans, 
Then little Michael Slattery would tear the bedclothes up for 
scenes. 
Ile is crazy, he is lazy, he broke his leg last week, 
He is .always singing, always dancing, and playing tragedy in 
his sleep. 
He is always talking of Mary Anderson, he'd support her on 
the stage, 
Sure last night he got so crazy, we had to put him in a 
cage. 
CHORUS. 
Then it's little Michael Slattery stole his father's pants, 
He cut them up for tights to do a 
song and dance; 
When his mother was asleep he cut her hair off for a 
wig, 
Now little Micky Slattery is doing an acrobatic jig. 
He cut off his father's whiskers to play Hamlet and King Lear, 
Took a 
shot gun to his mother and made her walk off on her ear, 
He learned his sister dancing, cut off eleven of her toes, 
Now little Micky Slattery is singing tenor through his nose. 
For he's dramatic, he's lunatic, he is clean gone off his base, 
His father and his mother say he is a 
Celebrated Case, 
He says he takes the cake, as an actor he beats them all, 
Next week he plays Julius Caesar down at Solomon Duff's 
Then it's little, Ste.

In Scotland, France and Germany, 
Music you will hear, 
The Italian loves to play the harp, 
He plays so soft and clear. 
Sweet music always charms my ear, 
Wherever it may be, 
I 
love to hear Tom Moore's sweet songs, 
They have such harmony.

I 
love music, I 
love singing, 
I 
love dancing—it's entrancing, 
I

The Irish songs are soft and sweet, 
They harmonize so well,

Whose memory shall reign 
In Scotland where he lived and died, 
And honored was his name.

There's one now whom I'll name, 
his praise is sung both far and near,

Who Americans will adore, 
this works are read throughout this world, 
prom this to foreign shore.

Arrah, my name is Isaac Murphy, 
And I'll have ye all to know 
That I

Near the county of Mayo. 
I 
can walk six months and never stop, 
I 
can run faster than a 
train; 
Faith, I 
am soon going over to England, 
To bring the belt Rowell took back again. 
CHORUS. 
I'll walk the first hundred miles on my head, 
The second on my toes; 
The third I'll walk on my eye-brows, 
And the fourth upon my nose. 
The fifth and last I'll walk on my ear, 
Then the Atlantic I 
walk across, 
Sure the Philadelphia Bladder says, 
Of all walkers I 
am the boss. 
I 
can walk from here to Australia and back 
In about three days and a 
half, 
Or around the world in a 
hundred hours— 
When I 
told O'Leary he gave me the laugh. 
I 
can walk for a 
year without any sleep, 
And keep waltzing around on the track; 
It would take me ninety minutes, just, 
To walk from here to Germany and back. 
I'll walk the first hundred, & c.

Sung by PAT ROONEY. 
Presented to FIELDS and H ANSON. 
Give my boxing-gloves to brother, mammie, when I'm dead, 
When the sexton puts me under in my little bed ; 
If the job is like to throw him when the string he jerks, 
Get some little boy to show him how the old thing works. 
[Repeat last line. 
Mamma, buy me a 
bran new Ulster, hire a 
Pullman car, 
Give me a 
bath of Florida water, I 
see the gates ajar ; 
Give me a 
dose of paregoric—there's nothing about me mean, 
Give the sexton half a 
dollar to see that my grave's kept green, 
[Repeat last line. 
Give my chewing gum to sister, I 
don't want it any more, 
On my lips it raised a 
blister that was awful sore ; 
Sing to me the Last Rose of Summer—mamma, don't you cry, 
For in the clouds I'll raise a 
racket, in the sweet by and by. 
[Repeat last line.

Sprinkle my body with powdered sugar, smear me over with 
tar. 
Cover my form with peacock's feathers—I 
want to be an 
angel, ma; 
Let me bite the old torn cat's t.il off, she can't ketch no mice, 
Let me go bathing with the girls—it's naughty, but it's nice.

I 
live in a 
brown stone tenement, 
With green shutters painted white ; 
There's a 
family of cats lives in the rear, 
They play " Pinafore " every night. 
They sing something about Maria, 
And the times are very hard ; 
Oh, they'll chew tobacco and spit in your eye, 
The cats in our back yard. 
CHORUS. 
Tral a

They have walking matches on the fence, 
Have picnics in the cellar ; 
I

Thomas, 
You ought to hear them beller. 
They sing alto, base, and tenor, 
Oh, they ought to be feathered and tarred 
Oh, they are worse than Haverley's Minstrels, 
Yes, the cats in our back yard.

In that little Isle so green, 
The home of all true Irish, 
And the best place that I've seen.

Just over, just over, but I'll noon go back again. 
IRISH COMIC SONG. 
Written by JAMES BRADLEY. 
Oh, I'm a 
young married man 
And I 
have a 
darling daughter, 
Who never did care much for work, 
'Twas her mother's own wish that she ought to, 
She said she fancied the stage 
And I 
gave her my final request, 
And now she's a 
great ballet dancer 
. 
And she ranks along wid the rest. 
CtIOTIUS. 
On the bills She is Madame McShorty, 
But the right name is Bridget McCarty, 
She comes home at night and also matinees, 
With large baskets of flowers and also boquets, 
She is my darling daughter 
And I 
am the man that taught her 
To go around on her toes and wear spangled clothes, 
Such a 
darling young girl is my Bridget. 
When salary day does anive, 
All toil and woe it does smother, 
Wash day she always will have 
A 
kick with her poor ould mother, 
She's got a 
young clerk in a 
bank, 
Who sees her right home to the door, 
And pays a 
large gang in the gallery 
To give her a 
hand and encore. 
(Chorus). 
Last Saturday night I 
got paid, 
I 
thought I'd go to the theatre, 
I 
took my old woman along, 
To 
a 
sent in the front I 
did take her, 
Bridget came out on the stage, 
My son Dannie was up in the tier, 
He cried out " Go in, sister Bridget," 
And they threw him right out on his ear.

As sung by PAT ROONEY. 
Copyrighted by A. J. FisitER, 1879. 
I'm a 
man that's known both far and near, 
McCluskey that's my name, 
An' all the politicians, sure, 
Are envious of my fame; 
I 
got a 
grip in the auld Sixth Ward, 
And ye bet I 
make it pay, 
An' 1 
hould a 
high position 
Upon Election Day. 
CHORUS. 
As I 
walk through the ward, 
As proud as a 
lord, 
The gang rise their hats and cry out, " Clear 
the way." 
Oh I 
for style an' for air, 
There is none to compare 
Wid McCluskey on Election Day. 
It was on last election time, 
I 
ran for Alderman, 
My political antagonist 
Was a 
loafer named McCann; 
But I 
trated all the boys I 
met, 
From Harlem to Cow Bay, 
And they said they'd vote nine times for me 
Upon Election Day. 
As I 
walk, & c. 
Election time came quickly round, 
I 
wint to make a 
speech, 
But the gang they knocked theclatfonn down, 
And I 
loud for help did screech. 
Now although I 
didn't get the place, 
Just listen to what I'll say, 
I'll play them all for suckers 
On next Election Day.

She was hanging on a

She was as purty and as sweet as a

Such clothes you never did see ; 
She had a 
darling little bonnet with a 
poodle dog upon it, 
She's the Irish girl that winked at me. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, my, wasn't she a 
beaute, 
Tra la le, skip the gutter, the baby's got a 
tooth; 
Wrestling pots, that was her duty, 
And her sister was a 
boarding-house cook. 
My name is Patsey Marley, and the daisies call me 
Charley, 
I'm a 
double-breasted acrobatic Mick ; 
My name is 
Patsey Marley, and the daisies call me 
Charley, 
I'm a 
double-breasted acrobatic Mick. 
The other day we thought we'd take a 
little walk, 
For to try and see the daisy ; 
While walking down the street, by chance we her did 
meet, 
With a 
man about six foot eight. 
Says I : " Excuse me, my dear, 
But isn't your name Arabella?" 
She hit me such a 
poke that my neck she nearly broke, 
And she knocked me head and heels in a 
cellar. 
Oh, my, wasn't she a 
beaute, &c.

Oscar Magee. 
Written by JmuEs RICHMOND for PAT ROONEY. 
Copyrighted by A. J. FISHER, / 879. 
Oh, ladies and gentlemen, I 
now tell to ye 
About a 
young man named Oscar Magee; 
He had cast-iron teeth, and he never eat hash, 
When his money was all spent he had to pawn his moustache. 
Ha had a 
brother named DeWitt, in Brooklyn he did preach, 
lie married old Corbin down at Manhattan Beach ; 
He married them in a 
cellar, he must have been in a 
trance, 
The wedding present was a 
cast-iron overcoat and a 
wooden 
pair of pants. 
He bought a 
gold mine in Hoboken, and he found nothing 
but rocks ; 
He went crazy and mad and cut his throat—with a 
pair 
of socks. 
He was found guilty of arson and stealing twenty gold rings, 
Then he was taken 
to a coal 
yard, and hung by the 
shoe strings. 
Ireland's Shore. 
Composed by JoE A. BURGESS, and sung with immense success by Miss 
ANNIE BURGESS. 
Presented to FIELDS and HANSON. 
In a 
little cottage neatly built 
Upon old Ireland's shore, 
Where the shamrock and the thistle grows so free, 
Lives a 
colleen dear so sweet and fair 
Upon that isle so green, 
And her dear face now I 
often long to see. 
CHORUS. 
But she's far away from me across the deep blue sea, 
Could I 
but see her bright sweet face once more. 
And when .
1.i•e met as strangers, 
Then I 
vowed we'd meet again ; 
She's my darling treasure, 
Pride of Ireland's shore. 
Oh, my love for her has grown stronger 
Since we met on Erin's shore, 
And I 
long to see the land where I 
was born, 
And to tell the love that I 
have cherished 
All those years for her, 
And to hear her kind heart's answer in return. 
But she's far away, &c. 
I 
have seen the Isle so green, 
I've gained my fair colleen, 
Tier love so pure is mine forevermore. 
And when we met as strangers 
Then I 
vowed we'd meet again ; 
I've my darling treasure, pride of Ireland's shore. 
But she's far away, & c.

I LEAVE IRELAND AND MOTHER BE-
CAUSE WE ARE POOR. 
Written and Composed by W. T. GROGAN. 
Dedicated to GF-0. 
W . 
RAYNOR, the popular tenor. 
FAREWELL, dear Erin, I 
now must leave thee, 
With good heart I'll bear it, if 'tis fate's decree; 
With a 
burden of sorrow, an exile I 
roam, 
Through cruel misfortune I'm driven from home. 
My aged, lonely mother I 
leave in despair, 
Who is helpless and feeble from sorrow and care. 
Hardship and trouble we long did endure, 
I 
leave Ireland and Mother because we are poor. 
To reflect on the past it occasions regret, 
The days of my boyhood I 
ne'er can forget; 
The home that my father left mother and I, 
We now must abandon, and are turned out to die. 
Farewell, to your valleys and moss-bordered stream, 
Your mountains so lofty, and meadows so green, 
The place of my birth, darling sweet Donaghmore, 
I 
leave Ireland and Mother because we are poor. 
When leaving my mother she grieved we should part, 
She said separation almost broke her heart, 
My blessing be with you, prosperity attain, 
Is the wish of a 
mother you may ne'er see again; 
She filled with emotion, it pained her to speak, 
As the large pearly tears coursed down her pale cheek. 
With a 
parting farewell, at our old cottage door, 
I 
leave Ireland and Mother because we are poor.

American Fortune-Telling Cards.—This is the`old-

published it for years, and the demand is continually increasing. 
These Cards are arranged and printed in series—Hearts, Clubs, Dia-
monds and Spades--and each of these into K for King, Q for Queen, 
and K 
for Knave, and numbers 1, 3, to 10. 
The Cards are arranged in 
four rows, and are to be read according to directions. 
Many of the an, 
swers depend upon the position certain cards bear to other cards. The 
method of playing is somewhat complicated, but the directions have 
been made so that very little study will suffice to an ordinary under-
standing. 
Many professional Fortune-Tellers use these cards, and we 
are in receipt of letters in relation to them from all parts of the U. S.

ir;ourting Cards.—This Series of Cards has been arranged 
to meet a 
want frequently felt by young people—a 
want of means of 
expressing one's sentiments in such Ft way as to be non-committal. 
Many young ladies are visited by 
ntlemen who are either too diffi-
dent or too fearful of a 
repulse, to venture upon asking the momentous 
question. The lady is restrained, by custom and a 
sense of propriety, 
from doing anything that would seem to be an unladylike encourage-
ment. As a 
result of this dilemma, many lives are spent as an unloved 
' 
tedious existence, which might have been prolonged and enjoyed in the 
happiness of matrimony. 
This pack of Cards will overcome the diffi. 
culty, and being in the shape of questions and answers, will cover every 
phase of courtship. 
The sentiments conveyed therein need not be 
adopted by the parties to the game as their own, unless it accords with 
the state of their affections, which fact makes a 
further explanation un-
necessary. The playing of these Cards is not restricted to two players, 
but may be enjoyed by evening parties

" 
A 
Little Book has lately appeared in print at Mr. A. 
J. 
FISHER'S, 98 Nas 
sau street, called the " Little Flirt." We 
cannot say that we recommend 
it to our young lady and gentlemen readers, as we think it would only 
encourage the bad habit of 
flirting." Unfortunately, there is enough 
of it done without any ftirther necessity of explaining 
how, when and 
where to do it," and this little volume would advise and initiate the_un-
corrupted in practicing what is commonly called 
flirting." 
The N. Y. Evening Telegram writes: 
We have lately seen a 
neatviftile 
book, bound in Morocco leather, costing twenty-five cents, callci the 
" 
Little Flirt," published by A. 
J. 
FISHER, No. 98 Nassau Strkt. It 
gives information of the modus operandi of flirting, and of the mean-
ing of every motion of the handkerchief, fan, glove and parasol. As 
there is nothing at all objectionable in the volume, and its contents 
might afford some innocent amusement to many, we do not hesitate to 
recommend it to our young lady and gentlemen readers."
