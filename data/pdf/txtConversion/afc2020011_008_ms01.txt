Library in Stillwater, Oklahoma. 
Project Detail 
This project is supported by the Archie Green Fellowship of the American Folklife Center at the 
Library of Congress. 
The purpose of the Immigrant Women Artists Oral History Project is to examine the occupational 
folklife of first-generation immigrant women artists living in Oklahoma and the networks of 
support that allow them to pursue their vocations in a 
new environment. This series of interviews 
examines not only the cultural and occupational traditions that these artists nurture in straddling 
multiple cultural identities, but also the translation of an artist's occupational life between 
multiple cultural and physical spaces. 
Legal Status 
Scholarly use of the recordings and transcripts of the interview with Behnaz Sohrabian is 
unrestricted. The interview agreement was signed on February 18, 2020.

About Behnaz Sohrabian... 
Iranian-born Behnaz Sohrabian took her first art lessons at age ten when an encouraging teacher 
first recognized her talent, but starting her higher education, she pivoted to applied chemistry, 
married, and then finished a 
degree in art and a 
master's in art studies. After her divorce, having 
already made multiple trips to the US, the artist moved to Oklahoma City in 2009 to launch her 
career. Her bold compositions in a 
range of media often focus on the female form or women's 
faces, sometimes incorporating random Farsi letters as commentary or embellishment. Currently 
represented by several galleries, Sohrabian focuses her marketing inside the state and also 
teaches art in school and from her home. 
In this interview, besides discussing her positioning as an immigrant artist, Sohrabian relates 
memories of the shift to gender-segregated education in Tehran after the Iranian revolution. She 
draws a 
connection between traditional Persian painting and the narrative impulse of her own 
work in which each image, however abstract, has a 
story. She laughs about the difficulties of 
tapping her daughter as a 
model, shares about caretaking her mother, and explains what she sees 
as a 
thread of sadness unifying her images of women.

This is Julie Pearson-Little Thunder with the Oklahoma Oral History 
Research Program at Oklahoma State University. Today is February 18, 
2020, and I'm interviewing Behnaz Sohrabian in Edmond, Oklahoma, for 
the Oklahoma [Immigrant] Women Artists interview series. Behnaz, you're 
an Iranian American. You became an American citizen in 2017, and you 
work in a 
range c 
f 
genres from landscapes to f 
locals to figurative studies (f 
women and abstract paintings, as well. There's a 
strong graphic element to 
a 
lot c 
f 
your work, and as you say in your resume, you sort c 
f 
see everything 
as connected to your positioning as a 
woman. I 
look forward to learning 
more about your art and 1, fe. Where were you born, and where did you grow 
r, 
p? 
Thank you so much for having me. Yes, my name is Behnaz, and my last 
name is Sohrabian. I 
was born in Kermanshah, and I 
grew up in Tehran. My 
father was in army. He was colonel. At that time, he was on mission, and I 
was born in Kermanshah. It's a 
big, monumental and historical city. When I 
was ten or eleven years old, I 
went there to visit my city, yes. When I 
was 
one to two years old, my parents moved to capital, to Tehran. 
I 
see. 
Yeah. When I 
was ten years old, my mother noticed that I'm interested in 
drawing and painting. Then I 
started to go to different art classes. At the 
first-year art class that I 
started when I 
was ten years old, my instructor or 
mentor's name was Nima Petgar. He was a 
great mentor. I 
continued 
studying and practicing since forty-five years ago. 
Since you were ten years old. (Laughter)

Sohrabian 
Exactly. 
What was it like growing iAp in Tehran? You probably don't have many 
memories since you were just two when you moved bE fore in your birth 
village, but what was it like growing iAp in Tehran? 
You know, I 
can tell you when I 
was around five, six years old, I 
remember, 
you know, my memories. Before that, I 
don't know. (Laughter) I 
don't have 
any memory. Yes, Tehran is a 
great city. It's capital. Like I 
can tell you the 
majority of the capital, it's a 
crowded city. Most of the time, you spend your 
time in traffic jam. You know, it's my first home. I 
love Tehran. I 
love 
Iranian people, as well. Here, actually, it's my second home, Oklahoma. I 
love Oklahoma people, also, yes. 
I'm glad to hear that. 
Thank you. 
What was your creative environment like in your home? 
At that time, actually, I 
was a 
kid. My 
brother and my sister, they were older 
than me. I'm the youngest kid. They moved to US to continue their 
education in US, so I 
was the only child. My 
parents had great attention on 
me, and always they ask me about art, "Which art classes are you going to 
participate in for the art galleries?" They were so interested in taking me to 
checking art galleries and museums, yeah. 
And did you have art in your home a 
little bit, too... 
Yes, yes. 
... that you paid attention to? 
Yes, I 
had a 
room for myself, so I 
have my easel. Also, I 
have a 
few pieces 
that I 
did when I 
was ten years old. My ex-husband, maybe two or three 
years ago, he gave me as a 
gift or surprise gift. When I 
met him in Dubai, he 
brought for me, and he said, "I 
think you left something in our house." I 
said, "What was that?" Then I 
opened the envelope, and I 
saw. There are my 
paintings when I 
was ten years old. It was so interesting. 
Do you remember your very first piece c 
f 
art you made? 
Oh, yeah, yes, yes.

Little Thunder 
Sohrabian 
What was your first piece c 
f 
art you made? 
It was a 
still life. At that time, most of, you know, our practice was from the 
photo. We tried to copy and study them. Then I 
started to set a 
good still 
life, and we tried to paint it. I 
will show a 
few of them. 
And this was under Nima? 
Nima Petgar, yes... . 
So at ten years old you take your first classes, and he's teaching. He 
recognizes your talent and encourages you. 
Yes, exactly. He was so patient. He was a 
great mentor. I 
was the youngest 
student. Maybe we had one or two students as age as me, yeah. 
But most c 
f 
them were older. 
Yes, they were teenagers. They were young, beautiful ladies. 
And did the class meet once a 
week? 
Yes, once a 
week. It was on Thursday because our weekend in Iran is 
Thursday and Friday. The class was far away from our house, so my mother 
tried to stay in class, reading magazine or something like this for three 
hours. It wasn't easy. 
She was devoted, too. 
Yes, exactly. 
Can you talk a 
little bit about your school experiences and whether there 
was an art component in school? What were your school experiences like at 
what we would call elementary or junior high level? 
Yeah, you know, in school we had maybe a 
class for art, but everybody does 
everything that they like. There isn't any obligation to do something that 
that teacher asks us. It's good because after I 
graduate from art school, I 
learned we shouldn't push children to do this, to do that, especially for art 
because we limit their creativity. It's not good. Maybe at that time, it was a 
great chance for us. Our teacher didn't ruin our creativity. We were so free. 
We tried to create everything that we wish. Now when I 
have student, 
maybe around ten to fifteen, I 
try to guide them, but I 
don't want to push 
6 
them to obey my rules or regulation for the drawing. I 
wanted them to be 
free. That's important. At that time, yeah, art classes were so fun. We really 
enjoyed. 
[00:10:40] 
Little Thunder 
And it's girls going to school together... 
Sohrabian 
Yes. 
Little Thunder 
... or did you have... okay. 
Sohrabian 
Yes. When I 
was thirteen years old, we had a 
revolution, and after 
revolution, they separate boys and girls. We were separate. 
Little Thunder 
So prior to that, it was boys and girls in the same classes, prior to the 
revolution? 
Sohrabian 
Before the revolution, they were mixed, but after that, yeah, especially for 
schools and even for universities. I 
have experience. My 
first bachelor is in 
chemistry from Azad University. Their staircase is separated for girls and 
for boys, even for the elevator. 
Little Thunder 
Yet you got this degree in chemistry, which is a 
science. 
Sohrabian 
Yes, yes. When I 
was eighteen years old, I 
passed the entrance exam for 
nursing school, but when I 
was freshman, I 
decided to change my major. 
Then I 
got married, and I 
was so excited for marriage. (Laughter) 
Little Thunder 
So you finished your degree, but you got married. 
Sohrabian 
I 
changed my major. I 
went to science university in Azad University. At that 
time, I 
was married. 
Little Thunder 
I 
see, okay. 
Sohrabian 
[00:13:30] 
I 
got married very, very soon. When I 
was eighteen years old, my ex-
husband met me, then we got married. Then my girl was born, the older one, 
the next year. Then I 
went to school, and I 
graduated from Azad University 
in applied chemistry. Then I 
decided to go to art school because I 
thought 
Iranian care about degrees. So yeah, I 
graduated from art school. The name 
of my university is Alzahra. Then my master is in art studies from Art 
University. 
7 
Little Thunder 
So while you were getting your degree in chemistry, you're also raising your 
daughter, and you're not painting very much. 
Sohrabian 
Yes, yes. I 
practice, but I 
couldn't be a 
full-time painter. When I 
graduated 
from science university, I 
had more time. I 
tried to go to different art classes. 
Then one of my friends told me, "Your drawing is great. It's good. We have 
a 
kind of appointment with our professor at Art University. Show him your 
drawing." Then I 
show him my drawing, and he encouraged me to have a 
solo exhibition. 
Little Thunder 
Oh, wow. 
Sohrabian 
Then, yeah, I 
tried to find a 
good gallery to display my paintings and 
drawings. Then the lady who was the owner of the art gallery told me, "You 
are self-taught. I 
don't let you have exhibition in my art gallery." Because of 
that... 
Little Thunder 
Because you don't have a 
degree. 
Sohrabian 
...yes, because of that, it came to my mind, it's better I 
go to art school. I 
asked my friend, "Are you going to help me, because I 
have to study hard?" 
She said, "Of course." She introduced some classes for studying art major. 
Then after one year of studying hard, I 
passed the entrance exam. Also at the 
same time, I 
had my solo exhibition at Barg Art Gallery. 
Little Thunder 
At a 
dj ferent gallery... 
Sohrabian 
Yes. 
Little Thunder 
... where they were not insisting you already have your degree. 
[00:15:45] 
Sohrabian 
Yes, exactly. That lady was picky about the degree, but the other art 
galleries, I 
think they don't care about. Now I 
think the most important, your 
artwork should have something to say to audience, not my degree. 
Little Thunder 
Sohrabian 
Right. So what was the art landscape like in Tehran at that time? What kinds 
cf styles were popular? Were galleries equal opportunity places for women 
artists and male artists? 
Yeah, you know, we have different subject matters for displaying the art 
pieces in different art galleries. For portrait figure, it's a 
little bit hard 
because it's Islamic government in Iran. They have the rules that a 
nude 
drawing, it's forbidden, and they check art galleries before having a 
show. 
This information is related to ten years ago before I 
move here. I 
was, and I 
8 
still am, obsessed with portrait figure. As an artist, I 
think a 
good artist 
should know about the structure of the face and the body joints, muscles. 
Everything is great help. Knowledge always, I 
say, doesn't hurt. I 
don't 
want to just splash the colors. It's better when we have knowledge about the 
body. The hardest, I 
think, part of the drawing and painting is figure. It's 
hard to display nude, or maybe it's impossible. At that time, fifteen years 
ago, ten years ago, I 
try to cover some part of the figure or nude drawing 
with just a 
flat and plain surface of the colors as a 
collage or as a 
just plain 
surface. You can see my pieces on my page on Facebook, my business page. 
I 
classified them with "Before 2010" so you can see. I 
found, at that time, 
that way that I 
can communicate with my people, but here, there isn't any 
limitation. There isn't any censorship. I'm free. I 
can, yeah, have nude 
figure. I 
just try to connect with your question. We have different show with 
different subject matters in Tehran. We have great artists, also, that they can 
communicate with people around the world nicely, beautifully. 
[00:19:59] 
Little Thunder 
Sohrabian 
Having a 
global impact. So you work in a 
very representational style, but I 
wonder f you can just talk a 
little bit about traditional, maybe, Persian 
painting and ... how much you were exposed to that and how that might have 
impacted your work. 
Okay, the masterpieces that we have, they are so small. They are beautiful. 
The artist goes to the details, and they just complete it with some poem or 
stories. They are narrative, maybe.... 
Little Thunder 
Storytelling. 
Sohrabian 
[00:23:26] 
Exactly, exactly. I 
think maybe I 
try or maybe instinctively this kind of 
narrative or having story behind each work of the Asian Persian paintings 
that come to my art because I 
cannot paint one hundred or pure abstract. 
Mine has, even when I 
paint abstract painting, it has a 
kind of story behind 
my abstract painting. A 
portrait figure, yes, you can find a 
story. There is a 
different interpretation. I 
think it's great when people interested in my 
paintings. I'm shocked at how they connected to these paintings because our 
language is different, our culture is different. My 
individual culture is 
different with Iranian women and also with American women, but they can 
communicate. It's shocking for me. I 
want to get back to your question 
again about the Asian pieces that we have. They have great color 
combination. They are so vivid. They are so happy colors. They have the 
story, yes. You can see how they are modern, how they are contemporary, 
how the artist is intellectual. Many artists just look at these pieces and get 
some inspiration.

Sohrabian 
Right, right. 
Yeah, it's amazing. 
So do you join women's artist association in Tehran? I 
noticed that as you 
start having shows, you're not only having shows in Tehran, but you're also 
having shows.... I 
think there was one in Amman, Jordan, at the UN and one 
in Turkey. 
Yes. 
I 
guess my 
first question is are you part cf a 
sort cf artist league cf women, 
or are you just part cf a 
groiAp that gets chosen to exhibit here or there? 
You know, it was a 
society of painting in Tehran that I 
took my paintings 
into the meeting. It was a 
group of juror, and they checked my pieces. Then 
they accepted my paintings. My 
level, they thought it's good, so I 
can be 
one of them. It's a 
kind of Iranian painting society, something like this. Then 
when I 
had a 
group show in Amman, it was from university. They chose or 
collect our paintings. Yeah, we had a 
show over there. Then I 
started to send 
my paintings here. My 
brother who lives in Georgia, Atlanta, he started to 
bring my drawings. At that time, I 
was a 
student. He encouraged me to 
create more and more. 
Was he selling them for you? 
Yes, yes, yeah. He soldI remember 2009, we had a 
good sale. He gave me 
the whole money without taking any portion for himself. That's awesome. 
He doesn't have a 
gallery, but he was just selling directly to other people? 
He is selling art pieces now. 
I 
see. 
Now, unfortunately, we don't have any connection, but at that time, he 
started to sell paintings. He started to bring art from the other states and 
other countries, also. 
Wow, so he was dealing art and selling art. 
Yes, yes, yeah.

So how did you end iAp coming to the United States? 
My 
father was the first person who came to US before they had me. Always 
he was talking about US and American people, how they are nice and warm, 
friendly, so it was my dream to move someday to US. They sent my brother. 
My 
parents sent my brother and sister to US to continue their education at 
university. I 
was the youngest kid, so I 
couldn't come to US because the 
American Embassy was occupied at that time. I 
was thirteen, fourteen years 
old. My 
brother told us it's better [for] us stay in Iran. "When you graduate 
from high school, then you can move here." I 
said, "Okay." Then I 
got 
married. Then I 
couldn't come here. For the first time when I 
came here to 
visit as a 
visitor, I 
was twenty-eight years old with my oldest girl.... She 
was seven years old, and I 
was twenty-eight. I 
really loved America. 
Did you go to Georgia first, or where did you go first? 
I 
cameI think I 
went to Georgia first; then I 
came to Oklahoma. Then I 
went to Georgia; then I 
went to Tehran. My 
ticket was something like this. 
Then my ex-husband told me, "We can go to US to visit our family, but we 
can make money and work in Tehran." I 
said, "Okay," but I 
came here five 
or six.... 
He had 
family here, too. 
Yes, his family live in California. 
Okay. 
I 
came here, during when I 
was married, five or six times. Then when I 
got 
divorced, I 
said, "Okay, it's a 
good time to move to another place, and 
America is the best place for me," because, you know, I 
was in love with 
America. 
How did your father come? Was he just being a 
tourist when he came? 
He was on mission. He was in army, as I 
told you. For one year he was in 
Maryland. He passed two courses. 
Training. 
Yes. Still, I 
have his notebook that.... It's awesome. He is so organized. His 
handwriting is beautiful. Then 2009, I 
went to Penn Square Mall, and I 
had a 
few of my pieces. I 
met Glen Thomas, and I 
show him my pieces. He said, 
11 
"Yeah, you can have one wall here. You can rent it." I 
rent a 
wall. Then my 
sister was responsible for replacing paintings for me.

Because this is a 
collective where you can, everybody takes turns paying for 
part cf the space. 
At 50 Penn Place Art Gallery, they rented their walls. 
I 
see, okay. 
Every month, two months, it depends. I 
rented a 
wall. I 
started to send my 
paintings for one year to my sister. My 
brother before that brought my 
pieces to US to Georgia before 2009. Then 2010, I 
came here, so I 
started 
working with 50 Penn Place Art Gallery. In 2012, I 
met Joy Reed Belt at her 
art gallery. She told me she likes my ... works. Sometimes, I 
mix Persian or 
Farsi words with English words. (Laughter) 
That's all right. 
Yeah. I 
said car. Car means painting, artwork, something like this. 
Okay, great. Thank you. (Laughter). 
Anyway, yeah, she said, "It's good, so we can have your pieces next 
month." So since 2012, I've worked with Joy Reed Belt at the JRB Art 
Gallery. 
At JRB. 
Yes. 
That's cool, and I 
can imagine that it was not easy shipping that before you 
came out here. It was not easy shipping things. 
No, no, it was hard. Even I 
think for my brother was hard because packing 
artworks, it's not easy. At that time, most of my drawing was on paper, 
cardboard, and I 
know he had a 
tough time, maybe, for packing of that. 
So lifter you got here, how much did your art change? You've already got 
this pretty representational style, but it's also a 
very expressive style. It's not 
realism or hyperrealism. 
12 
Sohrabian 
Exactly. 
Little Thunder 
How did your colors, maybe, and your sul ject matter change lifter you got 
here? 
Sohrabian 
Little Thunder 
Sohrabian 
Little Thunder 
Sohrabian 
[00:35:23] 
Little Thunder 
Sohrabian 
Yeah, you know, before 2010, my works tended to be abstract figure. I 
don't 
know ended up being realism. Not photorealism, but you can see and you 
can recognize it's a 
face. It's a 
figure. I 
think the lifestyle, everything, 
environment affected my works and the style. 
And that freedom, maybe, to do the... 
Oh, yes, yes, the style is completely different. 
... the human body. 
Yeah, but I 
see the essence of my pieces is different with the other artists 
that grew up in European country or in America. As an Iranian American 
artist, the soul and the feeling of my painting is different. It shows it's not 
European or American artist. It's a 
kind of sadness, maybe, you can see in 
my works that I 
think it's related to my 
life, to being a 
woman, Iranian 
woman because I 
spend a 
lot of time in Iran in my first home. It's not easy. 
So not necessarily a 
sadness over being in between places, but a 
sadness 
that has to do with perhaps your personal life, but also kind cf a 
historical 
legacy, too? 
Yeah. I 
think I 
have hope in my paintings, and also I 
don't have any 
depression. I 
want to explain my personality, my character. I 
have a 
lot of 
hope, and I 
love to be alive. Also, I 
try to convey this energy on canvas or 
on paper. I 
see, even when I 
have a 
model and when I 
hire a 
model, I 
see a 
kind of sadness there is in the portrait in their eyes. I 
can tell you, it comes 
to my art unconsciously because maybe this kind of experience that I 
had in 
my life during fifty-five years old, you know, this experience is a 
raw 
material for my works, for expressing myself, for communicating with my 
viewers through visual elements, through colors, lines, and composition. It's 
not easy to be a 
woman. It's not easy to move to another country with a 
different language, with different culture. Immigration is not easy. 
Adaptation is not easy. I 
had the experience of revolution in our country, 
war with Iraq for eight years, and getting divorced after twenty-five years. 
It's not easy. It comes unconsciously in my art. Whenever I 
have class here 
or I 
have workshop, I 
have energy, and I 
ask people, "Just be present and 
forget about your problems," because art helped me a 
lot. When I 
paint, 
when I 
draw, I'm in present moment. It's perfect because as a 
human being, 
13 
we like to be in past and feel regretful about our past. We are really anxious 
about our future. When I 
paint, when I 
draw, I'm in present. It's great 
meditation.

Little Thunder 
Sohrabian 
That's beaut fully put. I 
love that you explain that sort cf sadness that creeps 
in at times. I 
noticed on your CV, I 
mean, on much cf your work, it evokes a 
whole range cf emotions, but on much cf 
it, you don't necessarily identfy 
like an ethnicity or a 
nationality with your work. You did have, on your CV, 
you had these portraits cf a 
woman with some Farsi script... 
Yes. 
... some writing in d,,) ferent positions over the face. That was very evocative 
for me. I 
wonder f you can talk about those pieces a 
little bit and how you 
used writing in them. 
Yes, yeah. I 
try to paint these pieces to say something to my viewers, that 
it's not easy to talk, to speak about everything. Because of that, these 
nonsense letters in Farsi just cover my neck. They are here. (Gestures) They 
are not coming to my mouth. I 
cannot make a 
word, a 
suitable sentence with 
these letters. 
Because they are nonsense words in Farsi. 
They are nonsense, but when we put these letters very beautifully, we can 
make a 
good word, a 
good voice. But who listens to these words? Woman is 
a 
complex creation. They are beautiful, you know. They are strong, but 
sometimes because of the dignity, because of some limitation that we have 
in our culture.... As a 
mom I 
couldn't express myself, what's in my heart, 
what's my problem. I 
tried to hide it, and I 
couldn't share it with people, 
even with my intimate friends. We have a 
kind of wall between our 
relationships, but the distance or generation is, you know, a 
new generation. 
They are different. Also, when I 
moved here, my personality is getting 
changed. I'm so happy because I 
don't want to lie, and when somebody asks 
me a 
personal question, I 
explain to them without any censor. You know 
what I 
mean? I 
try to share with them, and I 
feel much better. At that time, I 
couldn't express my feeling. I 
couldn't say what's my problem. So these 
letters just cover my eyes, cover my mouth, cover my neck. That shows, 
these letters, just nonsense and that she cannot express her personality. In 
our culture, if we do something, they say, "Oh, oh, you are a 
girl. You are a 
nice lady. You shouldn't do this. You shouldn't do that." I 
don't agree.

Yeah, and I 
think that comes across very power 
fully, even though a 
person 
might not recognize the individual Farsi, you know, characters and know 
that message cf kind cf repression or, you know, not being able to speak or 
see. I 
think that comes through really strongly. Can you talk a 
little bit about 
the position cf women in American society from your vieitpoint as an artist? 
What disappointed you, and what surprised you? You'd already had a 
little 
bit cf exposure. 
You know, I 
think it's first country in the world, US. There are some open-
minded intellectual, so I 
hope they don't have the problem that many 
countries have it right now. Still, you see some salaries for women maybe is 
less than men. I'm self-employed, so I 
don't have this kind of experience, 
but I've heard that for many positions that we have difference between 
being.... 
Right, in pay or... 
Yes, yeah. It's not good. 
... in treatment. 
I 
hope everything getting better and better. 
What is one cf the best compliments you've ever gotten on your work? 
The best compliment? 
Yes, or one cf your favorite compliments, maybe. 
You know, really, I'm shocked. I 
told you I'm shocked when people like my 
paintings and they say good words. Sometimes their interpretation is great. 
For example, for this series that I 
did, the title is I 
Am Here! People say their 
comments, their ideas about their eyes. I 
really enjoy it. Sometimes they say, 
"Oh, my god, yes, I 
could say my word through lines, through colors, 
paints." It's great. 
What a 
powerful statement to say, "I'm here, " and then you have, I 
think, in 
your number three, you know, because it's a 
series. ` I'm here, " just those 
two words are such a 
strong statement. 
Yeah, yeah. Sometimes I 
have this problem that I 
have a 
wandering mind. 
Sometimes I 
am here, but in the middle of our conversation, I 
go to maybe 
15 
Dubai to check my daughter. (Laughter) "Did she text me today?" Then I 
get back to you again. It's not good. (Laughter) I 
have wandering mind. 
When I 
say, "I'm here," maybe physically I'm not here, but I 
am here 
emotionally or vice versa. You know what I 
mean? 
[00:47:22] 
Little Thunder 
And I 
guess I 
was reading it as you finding your voice and this new kind (f 
freedom, like you said, and growing into this d,,)ferent kind cf 
person. "I'm 
here, and I'm going to be reckoned with, too. " I 
mean, I 
think it can mean 
that, as well. 
Sohrabian 
Yes, yes. 
Little Thunder 
`I'm here, and you can't make me invisible, and you can't ignore me 
anymore. 
Sohrabian 
Exactly, exactly, yeah. A 
few comments about this, that I 
saw many things 
with these eyes. I 
had many experiences, and you cannot ignore me. My 
ideas, my personality is important. You should think about this person in life 
as a 
human being. They should respect you, you know. Sometimes as a 
mom 
when I 
was married, I 
tried to be quiet. I 
tried not to argue, not to fight. I 
tried to respect my ex-husband's ideas. But after a 
while, you know, I 
thought, "Okay, I 
am a 
human being. I 
have a 
dignity, and he should respect 
me." He was educated, and he tried to respect my right as a 
mom, as a 
wife, 
as a 
woman. Still, I 
expect him more. You know what I 
mean? Also, this 
piece is called Joys and Pains. It's a 
self-portrait again. I 
thought, "Yes, I'm 
going to call these paintings Joys and Pains, that make these a 
person." 
[00:49:29] 
Little Thunder 
Right, that's a 
great.... 
Sohrabian 
Or that piece is Free bird, the best of show in 2018, Irving Art Association. 
Free bird, see? Her arms is surrounded with reddish or maroon color. It's 
contradiction. [There is contradiction between the form and the title.] Her 
arms is a 
little, you know, crossed. 
Little Thunder 
They look cot fined. 
Sohrabian 
Yes, confined. Now I 
call it Free bird. (
Laughter) 
Little Thunder 
You told a 
great story about using your younger daughter as a 
model 
sometimes. 
Sohrabian 
Yes, yeah. 
16 
Little Thunder 
Can you talk about that experience a 
bit? I 
think there are some other artists 
who can relate to that. 
My daughter? 
Yes. (Laughs) 
Sohrabian 
Little Thunder 
Sohrabian 
[00:51:29] 
Little Thunder 
Sohrabian 
Little Thunder 
Sohrabian 
Yes. Always, you know, when she posed for me, after a 
few seconds, she's 
starting to talk to me. (Laughter) Always, I 
ask her, "Would you please talk 
to me? Share your memories?" She doesn't talk to me, but when I 
ask her, 
"Would you please pose for me," she start remember everything, yeah, and 
share everything to me. I 
ask her, "Please don't talk. Please don't share right 
now because I 
want to concentrate." I 
cannot draw or paint and listen to 
somebody else. I 
just want to devote every cells to my work, and she says, 
"Okay, I'm getting bored, so bye, Mom." I 
should use my imagination to 
complete the drawing. It's hard. It's hard. (Laughter) 
Oh, that's cute. So you teach classes. How cften do you teach? 
Once a 
week. I 
started once a 
week. I 
think it's enough because always I'm 
alone and I'm working on my pieces, or I 
read an article related to art, or I 
go to watch a 
good movie at the movies. I 
thought it's better I 
see people. 
For many, many years people ask me, "Do you have any art class?" I 
started 
with demonstration, with workshop. I 
thought, "Yes, it's good to be among 
American people, also, once a 
week, Thursday." We have just maybe three 
artists at my home studio here. We started with a 
few workshop 
demonstration here. Then two or three of them asked me for continuing this 
kind of ... as a 
class. I 
said, "That's fine." We cover every session with a 
new 
lesson. For example, in January we covered with abstraction and also copied 
the van Gogh style. It's not in one session, but we are going to try a 
different 
style in one session. Then we are going to concentrate maybe a 
few more 
sessions on them. 
That sounds good, and they're getting a 
little art history, too. 
Yes, I 
give them more information about, for example, what's abstraction 
and who is van Gogh. It's good for me, also, because when I'm getting old, 
maybe I 
forget some lessons when I 
was student. It's good for my memory, 
also. (Laughter) 
Little Thunder 
What's one cf the most d,. ficult paintings you ever did and why? 
17 
Sohrabian 
For me, difficult painting is abstract because still I 
want to say something 
through just splashing the colors. Now I'm working on one abstract piece, 
but it came to my mind that I 
want to say, "People, it's Lady Justice, or it's 
Blind Justice. It's not just splashing the color." I 
want to say, "There is a 
chaos here, and we trust Lady Justice to help us." 
[00:54:55] 
Little Thunder 
There's a 
story that you're trying to get across. 
Sohrabian 
Yes, it's a 
narrative, yeah, painting. 
Little Thunder 
Do you do many commissions? How much cf your work is commission 
work? 
Sohrabian 
Yeah, I 
started with commission work maybe two or three years ago. When 
somebody asks me to do something, it's hard for me to say no in many 
ways, really. I 
don't know. I 
just try to be positive. Now I 
learn to say, "Let 
me think about that." I 
learned this sentence. But always I 
say, "Yes, I 
can 
do it. I 
can do it." Then when somebody asks me, "Can you do commission 
portrait," I 
said, "Yes." Then when I 
started, it was a 
little bit hard to make 
his or her taste close to mine. I 
know when people ask me commission work, 
they like my style. Now I 
think it's great. I 
enjoy it. When people give me a 
two-by-two picture or photo, then I 
make it twenty-four-by-twenty-four. 
They are happy with that, especially the client who trusts me. It's awesome. 
I 
feel great. 
Little Thunder 
It gives you that freedom to do what you want. 
Sohrabian 
Yes, yes. I 
really enjoyI think the result is great. But somebody when 
limit me, it's not good. 
[00:56:52] 
Little Thunder 
Sohrabian 
And another thing I 
got from reading your artist statement was this 
connection that you see. It doesn't matter f 
you're painting florals or you're 
painting landscapes or you're painting women, but the connection that you 
see between all cf these things. Can you talk a 
little bit about that? 
Yeah, I 
think I 
can see woman as a 
flower, and I 
can express my feelings 
through brushstroke. It doesn't matter what's the subject matter. I 
can 
express, yeah, through different subject matters. I 
see potential in different 
subjects. I 
remember I 
work in different series of the horse. A 
horse, I 
painted, and I 
draw, and I 
call it He's in Love. I 
try to have some bold 
brushstroke, and I 
try to have a 
kind of different composition, oblique 
maybe, because when a 
person is in love, it's restless. It's not so strict and 
18 
vertical, you know? It's restless. How can I 
show with brushstroke these 
feeling of love? It doesn't matter it's a 
horse or a 
human being or flowers. 
For example, I 
saw a 
documentary about Princess Diana. Then I 
drew or 
paint a 
few flowers, still life.

Thinking about her and processing. 
Yes, or for immigration. I 
was thinking about immigrating, so I 
put a 
flower 
in the vase. I 
thought, "I 
separated these flowers from the root, from the 
main stem, but still it's beautiful flower. It's a 
beautiful flower, but it's 
another place." I 
call it Immigrant. It's not in ... the soil. I 
separate it, but 
still, it's alive. Maybe if it was in the main stem, in the main soil in her first 
home, maybe she was more beautiful because it's not easy to live in another 
country with different culture, with different language. 
Yeah, and yet you've already kind cf explained how an immigrant artist.... 
Like, you came as an artist, and you're here as an artist, but you're a 
d,,)ferent kind cf artist. The things that you're adding are so rich because 
you brought with you what you have brought, and then you're adding to this 
new landscape. I 
think you've talked about that really, really well. 
Thank you. 
Let's talk about your approach and your techniques a 
little bit more. Your 
media, you work in a 
lot cf 
d,,)ferent media. 
Yeah, yes. To me, medium doesn't matter. The brand of the colors, paints, 
brushes doesn't matter. You can work with just paper and pencil and express 
yourself. I 
like oil medium. It's a 
beautiful texture. For some reason, acrylic 
is a 
good medium when I 
have, for example, commission work and I 
want to 
finish it up in a 
limited time. Dry very fast, but oil takes time. 
Right. 
I 
should be patient. (Laughter) Also, I 
like collage. Collage is great 
technique and style. 
How about—when you're working in oils, you're working on canvas mostly. 
Do you work on Masonite, too? 
Yes, yes. Also, I 
work on panel. 
19 
Little Thunder 
Do you incorporate much sketching into your work, or do you do 
preliminary sketching?

Little Thunder 
Sohrabian 
[01:06:55] 
Little Thunder 
No, I 
start with paint. At the same time, I 
apply lines and colors on the 
canvas. If I'm not pleased, I 
cover it and paint over that. I'm a 
picky person. 
I'm not pleased easily. Always I 
say this story. When I 
go to open studios, 
one of them is Geatches. The other one is in Edmond. The old name is CCA. 
Now it's OACA, Oklahoma [Academy of Classical Art] .... I 
should find it. 
Ted... actually, he's a 
great artist, tell me, "Just save this painting. Don't 
paint over that." I 
said, "Okay." I 
respect him maybe one week or two week. 
After that, I 
cover it or paint over it. (Laughter) Always when I'm leaving 
Geatches, he says, "Save it. Don't paint over it." (Laughter) 
"Don't paint over it. " 
"It's a 
good piece." 
That's neat. What comes first for you, for that impulse, that triggering cf the 
desire to paint? Is it a 
feeling, or is it a 
visual impression or a 
thought, or 
does it depend? 
Oh, you know, when I'm in front of a 
live model, I 
try to look at the model a 
few seconds. Then I 
get some inspiration from the light and shadows and the 
pose. I 
get some inspiration, and I 
try to convey my feeling, simultaneous 
feeling, on canvas. Then I 
think about the composition. At the same time, 
when I 
start, I 
think about the composition, color combination, and essence, 
but maybe later when I 
start, I 
think about the composition more. 
Simultaneous feeling is important to me. Sometimes I 
try to save some part 
of my painting or drawing-painting. I 
call these drawing-painting. It's not 
painting long pose. I 
don't work a 
few months on one piece. As long as I 
have a 
feeling about these pose, I 
try to finish it up maybe one session, three 
hours... 
I 
see. 
...because our feeling is changing. How can I 
work on one piece several 
months? I'm changing. My feeling is changing. I 
try to get some idea from 
this pose and transfer it on canvas. Maybe when I 
have a 
commission work 
and I'm working from a 
photo, it takes several session. 
How important are titles for you?

Titles is important to me. When I 
was in Iran, I 
didn't think about the title 
always. I 
say Untitled. I 
think it's a 
beautiful part for me now, how I 
can 
choose a 
suitable title to connect with concept and the form of the painting. 
It's very important to me now. When I 
choose a 
title, sometimes I 
really 
enjoy it. (Laughter) 
How about your signature? Can you talk about that a 
little bit? 
My signature is very, very simple. When I 
started to sign them, I 
didn't 
think that someday I'm going to make money through, you know, selling my 
pieces, so I 
tried to continue these long signature. 
And it's just simply your signature, sometimes on the lc ft, sometimes on the 
right. 
Yes, yeah. Sometimes I 
think it's part of my painting. I 
try to have it on the 
left, but sometimes I 
think it's better I 
sign it on the right because of the 
composition. Around 2012, my signature was so big. My clients now say, 
"We have a 
few pieces of you, and your signature was so big." I 
explain, 
"Yes, you are right. I 
thought maybe it was so expressive when I 
had my 
signature, but now I 
try to make it very small. I 
don't want to make it as a 
part of the painting." At that time, it was part of the painting, so expressive, 
"Behnaz Sohrabian," something like this, yeah. Now I 
try to be smaller and 
organized. 
You are taking care cf your mom right now and juggling your classes and 
your artwork. Can you talk a 
little bit about that? 
Yeah, yeah, 2015, my mother moved here. February 17, and today is the 
18th. Five years ago, she came here. She wanted to live with me because 
I'm single; at that time I 
was single. I 
really enjoy living with my mom. I 
try 
to do my best to be a 
good daughter for her, but, you know, three generation 
live here: my daughter... 
Right, your daughter. 
... me, and my mom. It's not easy. 
Cf women, three generations cf women. 
Yes. It's not easy. Sometimes my daughter try to make me calm and ask me 
be patient in front of my mom, but it wasn't easy because my mom was a 
strong lady.... (Laughter) It wasn't easy. I 
learned how to entertain myself 
with my art. I 
try to become quiet and try to spend my time with myself in 
21 
my art. It wasn't easy because she wanted to have a 
good company, and I 
wasn't a 
good company for my mom. It was a 
challenging, tough time for all 
of us, but we thought this way is the best way because my mom was 
disabled. She couldn't live by herself. Even if I 
wanted to hire a 
nurse, it 
was impossible. I 
couldn't afford. She couldn't afford. She was so 
thoughtful. She had a 
property for herself in Iran, but in this situation, 
unfortunately because of the politics issues, she cannot transfer her money 
here. We try to cope with our problems, yes, and respect our rights. It's not 
easy. Since last year, she's in hospice care. It's not easy. I 
have classes here. 
I 
close the door of her room, but I 
should be relax when I 
teach or when I 
paint. It wasn't easy, but it's part of my 
life.

I 
was going to ask you because I 
saw that you were still exhibiting. I 
was 
going to ask you how the new political situation has impacted you, and you 
explained an aspect cf that. I 
imagine it also makes it dicult to think about 
going to visit or exhibiting in Tehran at this point. 
You know, I 
don't think about having exhibition in Tehran because it's hard 
to ship my pieces to Tehran. One of my friend asked me, "If you want, I 
have a 
friend that she is interested in having your pieces here." I 
told her, 
"It's impossible shipping. It's expensive." I 
just focus in Oklahoma. 
Yeah, some good venues here. 
Yeah, just for art competition, I 
send my paintings to another state. I 
do 
work with other art galleries in different states. I 
have experience with an art 
gallery in California. It wasn't good because he thought I'm living in 
Oklahoma. I 
am not American, you know, so I 
don't know language, maybe, 
their language. Taking advantage of... 
Took advantage c 
f 
you. 
...me, it's not good because immigrant, and English is my second language. 
I 
know it's not good, so I 
stopped working with art galleries. When there is 
art competition, yes. If they accept my piece, I 
ship it to the art galleries. 
Other than that, I 
just work with JRB, and I 
have shows in different 
galleries, groups here. She let me have shows in here in different places, as 
well. 
Right. What is your relationship—there's quite an Iranian American 
contingent here in Oklahoma. What is your relationship with the

I 
don't have enough time for Iranian American community who live here, 
unfortunately. Also, I 
should take care of my mom. Also, I 
have a 
girl. She's 
an independent girl, thank God. I'm blessed to have her, really. She helps 
me more than me, you know. 
But it's still a 
very full plate. 
Yes. 
Well, you're in a 
new phase cf 
your career here. Glad to have your work, to 
be able to look at your work. Looking back so far at this point in your 1, fe, 
what was an important fork in the road for you when you might have made a 
d,,)ferent choice but you made this choice to take this path you're on? 
Would you please repeat your question? 
Sure. (Laughter) What was an important, you know.... We talk about a 
road 
and how the road will divide, and you have to sort cf choose to go one 
direction or the other. What was an important moment cf choosing for you? 
Yeah, you mean, ten years ago when I 
came here? 
Maybe ten years ago? Do you think that was it? 
You know, changing is not easy. When you push boundaries, when you 
push your comfort zone, it's not easy, but I 
think it work. I 
think I 
made a 
great decision in my 
life. Always when I 
think about my past, I'm so happy 
with my decisions. Even when I 
was eighteen years old, I 
wanted to get 
married with my ex-husband. He was educated, he was from a 
noble family, 
so I 
wanted to get married with him. After twenty-five years, I 
wanted to get 
divorce. I 
wanted to come here. I 
want to be a 
full-time painter, artist as long 
as I 
can. I 
try. It's not easy to be an artist, full-time artist, but I 
try. I 
try, and 
I 
think I 
should be positive. I 
told you, it's not easy to make these big 
decision because it's a 
big change in my 
life. Before 2010, I 
work for a 
high 
school and pre-university art school. I 
was a 
teacher. I 
work since eight to 
two p.m. Around three p.m. I 
was home, and I 
was painting because I 
had a 
studio separate from my house, from my home. I 
had my friends. I 
left them. 
It's not easy to leave your friends. They were intimate. They were precious 
for me. Now I 
just email, or sometimes WhatsApp or Telegram help me to 
communicate with them. It's not easy to be alone here. Always I'm painting. 
23 
[01:20:27] 
Little Thunder 
You've made some big sacr (ices to do this. Do you have anything else you'd 
like to talk about bE fore we look at your work? 
Sohrabian 
I 
think I 
talked a 
lot today. (Laughter) I'm not a 
talkative person, but I 
think 
I 
talked maybe two hours, around two hours. (Laughter) 
Little Thunder 
I 
really appreciate what you've shared. Well, we're going to take a 
pause, 
and then we'll look at your work. 
Sohrabian 
Perfect, thank you. 
Little Thunder 
Okay, we're looking at some portraits from your series [I 
Am 
Here], which 
you mentioned earlier. 
Sohrabian 
Yes, yeah, the technique is oil. I 
use oil. It's a 
self-portrait. I 
think I 
just tried 
to convey the essence, the feeling, the soul. I'm not looking for the likeness 
in this series. 
Little Thunder 
Right, and such neat—I 
love the way you've created, like, flesh tones with 
these d,,) ferent colors.

accepted to pose for me. Maybe or one or two session I 
work on this piece. 
[01:22:16]

see. Okay, here's one cf

Yes, yeah, different colors, complementary colors, like warm and cool color, 
red and green complementary colors. Also, the form and the pose is 
different. It's oblique. 
Little Thunder 
Yes.

The title is Sinking. I 
work on these paintings or drawing-painting for my 
February show that the title of the show was Love. I 
try to have red, warm 
color, dominant color here because as a, you know, symbol of the love, we 
can use red, warm color.

Yes, yes, yeah. 
Okay, and this piece has an interesting exhibit history. 
Yeah, this piece is twenty-by-twenty. I 
use oil again. It's a 
self-portrait. The 
title is No. This painting was accepted for Portrait Society of America for a 
few states. It was 2019. 
It was a 
regional competition, or a 
regional show. 
Yes, yeah. It was an art competition. Portrait Society of America was patron 
of the show. 
I 
see. 
From just a 
few states, one of them was Oklahoma that they chose this one. 
Oh, how neat. 
The title is No because it's related to my life again. One of my relatives or 
close family asked me, "Do this." I 
told him, "Let me think about it." He 
said, "Don't explain when you want to respond to me. Just say yes or no." I 
thought about this question and his request, and I 
really didn't want to say 
yes. Always I 
told you, personality or characters of me says, "Always be 
positive. I 
say yes." This time, I 
said no. I 
painted this one. I 
posted on 
social media earlier than the limit of the time that the gentleman asked me, 
"Say yes or no." I 
think he had a 
background when he saw this painting on 
social media that I'm going to text him, "No." (Laughter) Yeah, this is the 
story behind that. 
I 
think a 
lot c 
f 
women can relate to that. (Laughter) Well, thank you very 
much for your time today. 
Oh, thank you. Thank you.
