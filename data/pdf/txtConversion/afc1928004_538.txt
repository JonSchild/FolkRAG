WHEN I AM KING OF IRELAND 
Written by JAMES RICHMOND, for PAT ROONEY and MASTER ROBERTS. 
Copyrighted 1880, by The New -York Popular Publishing Co. 
I 
am a 
Corkonian Democrat and a 
statesman, 
I 
was mayor of France when I 
was sixteen; 
My cousin Pat is the governor of China, 
My sister Maggie is the queen. 
I 
invented the dictionaries and grammar 
To defend the workingman's cause; 
I 
crossed the Delaware with George Washington, 
And made all the country's laws. 
CHORUS. 
I'll make all the girls and women wear pants, 
There'll be no kid gloves on their hand; 
The Republicans will run the Irish 
When I 
am king of Ireland. 
I'll make princes out of all my sons, 
move the White House over to Cork; 
Have telegraph wires running to Heaven, 
Build an awning over New York. 
Fit put senators drawing dump- carts then, 
It'll give the treasury an ease; 
I'll send Hayes and Sherman exploring fogs 
And make aldermen out of Chinese. 
I'll make the girls, etc. 
MY DAUGHTER JOHANNA McNALLY. 
Written by JAMES RICHMOND. 
As sung by PAT ROONEY. 
Copyrighted 1880, by the New York Popular Publishing Co. 
My daughter Johanna plays on the piano, 
She is only sixteen years of age; 
She does jigs, and reels, and comic songs, 
And imitates me on the stage. 
Her head is bald with education, 
She gets three hundred a 
night in the bally, 
She is an Irish blonde and catches the guys, 
She is my daughter Johanna McNally. 
CHORUS. 
She is purty, oh, ain't she nice, 
Fresher than a 
ton of salt or ice } (Break) 
She bought three brown-stone fronts last week, 
But she'd rather live quiet in the alley, 
She broke 21.IcCullough's heart when she played Juliet, 
She is my daughter Johanna McNally. 
Mary Anderson asked her to double up, 
She said she had a 
better chance 
Doing a 
double clog with Edwin Booth, 
And a 
sensational song and dance. 
The Prince of Wales got stuck on her, 
He threw diamonds at her in the bally; 
But she'll be an old maid, of marriage she is afraid, 
She is my daughter Johanna McNally. 
She is purty, etc.

BIDDY TEE BAT:T.1+1T GIRL. 
Written by J. BRADLEY, and sung with great success 
PAT ROONEY at Harry Miner's New Theatre. 
I 
AM a 
gay laboring man, 
And I 
have a 
beautiful daughter, 
Who' never did care much for work, 
It's her mother's own,wish that she oughtes 
It seems that she fancied the stage, 
So I 
granted her final request, 
And now she a 
beautiful dance; 
And ranks along with the best. 
CHORUS. 
On the stage she is Madame La Shortie, 
But her right name is Biddy McCarty, 
She brings home at night, and at matinees, 
Large baskets of flowers and also bouquet& 
Oh, she is my only daughter, 
And I 
am the man that taught her 
To wear spangled clothes, and go round on her to,es, 
And there is no such a 
girl as Biddy. 
When salary day does arrive, 
All trouble and toil it does smother, 
For iust the day before that there was a 
kick, - 
The girl had been scolded by her mother 
she's courting a 
clerk in the bank, 
Who sees her safe home at the door, 
And pays a 
big gang in the gallery, 
To applaud in a 
perfect uproar. 
On the stage, etc. 
Last Saturday night I 
got Raid; 
I 
thought I 
would go to the theater, 
And take the old woman along; 
In the parquette in front I 
did seat her. 
When Biddy came out for to dance, 
My son Danny was up in the tier; 
eaied: " Go in, sister Biddy," 
When they bounced him right out 021 his oar,,

TILE DAY I PLAYED BASE BALL. 
Sung by PAT ROONEY. 
MY 
name it is O'Halloher, 
I'm a 
man that's influential, 
I 
mind my business, stop at home, 
My wants are few and small; 
Some blackguards 'tother day did come, 
They were full of whiskey, gin and rum, 
An' they took me out in the broilin' sun, 
To play a 
game of ball. 
They made me carry all the bats, 
They nearly drove me crazy, 
An' then they sent me out in ".‘ center field," 
But I 
paralyzed them all; 
I 
put up me hands to catch a "fly," 
Holy murther! it struck me in the eye, 
And they hung me on a 
line to dry, 
The day I 
played base ball. 
I 
took the bat an' hit the ball, 
I 
thought to San Franscisco, 
An' thin around the bases 
Three times I 
ran them all; 
But thin the gang began to howl, 
An' they said: " Ould man, you made a 
foul, 
An' they rubbed me down with a 
Turkish towel 
The day I 
played base ball. 
Two reporters begged to know me name, 
An' presinted me with a 
medal, 
An' they asked me for me photograph 
To hang upon the wall; 
They said that I 
had won the game, 
Though my head was broke and my shoulder lame 
in' they sent me home in a 
cattle train, 
The day I 
played base ball. 
THE DAY I WALKED O'
LEARY . 
J. RICHMOND. 
Sang by PAT ROON/ 
Air:—Base Ball. 
My name it is McGinty, yes 
I 
live on ham and floor, 
With O'Leary, the walker, I 
came here, 
For to walk a 
mi'e a 
hour. 
About half- past twelve o'clock last night, 
A gang gave me a 
terrible fright, 
They woke me up and set me tight, 
For to walk against O'Leary. 
They took vie to a 
great big field, 
And with alcohol set me crazy, 
They stripped the clothes off to the skins, 
And it makes feel so lazy ; 
It was then the gang began to talk, 
Saying who is the terrier going to walk, 
And they said they would hang me if I 
d 
butilk 
When I 
wallaad against O'Leary. 
Whe first mile I 
walked my legs were weak, 
And the gang commenced to holler, 
They sprinkled salted upon the track, 
And it made me feel so lazy ; 
All the other walkers were ahead, 
Eating sponge cake, pie and bread, 
0 heaven, I 
wish that I 
was dead, 
When I 
walked against O'Leary. 
I 
walked until I 
catch ,x1 the cramps, 
Around and around the track, 
All the ladies threw bouquets at me, 
There was a 
corn on my back. 
The judge told me it was time to stop, 
As around the track like a 
chicken I 
flop, 
For the want of a 
whiskey I 
thought I'd drop, 
The day I 
walked against O'Leary.

Sure my daughter can be found, 
And whera I

Where the band plays Flewy-come-flew, 
°Xis there I'll find my Mary Ann 
A-skipping the Tra-la-la-loo!

Bad luck to moonlight picnics,

She's gone to the divil intirely, 
Since she learned the Tra-la-la-loo!

PAT ROONEY'S PINAFORE. 
Sung with unbounded applause by the Only PAT ROONEY. 
Oh, when I 
was a 
kid I 
went to a 
German school, 
And because I 
was Irish they thought I 
was n 
fool; 
But I 
learned every language, and grew up so smart, 
That I 
got to be conductor on a 
big ash- cart. ( Repeat.) 
I 
pocketed all the cash to treat Grant to wine, 
And to the Queen of Ireland I 
sold the River Rhine ; 
And for being so fresh they rewarded me, 
By making me the ruler of all Germany. 
(Repeat last two line 
I 
went to work tending bar in a 
jewelry store, 
And I 
stole all the watches—about eleven ninety-four; 
Tiler I 
got a 
job in a 
bank, and they made me casl(

And I 
busted up the bank in less than a 
year. 
Then I 
went to be a 
jailer in a 
prison down South, 
I 
got drunk the first day and all the prisoners broke out; 
Then the Duchess of Edinburgh got mashed on me, 
And now I 
ama the ruler of all Germany. 
(Repeat last two lines.) 
I 
used to smuggle diamonds for my mother-

And I 
bought her a 
golden chariot, it took a 
hundred

And I 
put every relative I 
had in offices of cares, 
And in less than six months they were all millionaires. Repeat. 
Then I 
took seven freight cars from off the track, 
And I 
got the company's reward to bring them back ; 
Then I 
stole twelve million dollars from the treasury, 
And now I 
am the ruler of all Germany.

B.S. 
Written expressly for the Great PAT ROONEY by J
AMES 
MCND. 
My name is familiar to you's all, 
I 
am an Irishman from France ; 
I 
used to drink Bourbon, Rot Gut and Chinese Ale, 
'Till I'd get Saint Anthony's dance. 
I'd have the delirium tremens every night. 
With the police and the old woman I'd I . ve a 
terrible fight ; 
So 1 
thought I'd reform, and I 
done perfectly right, 
The night I 
joined the T. A. B.'s. 
When I 
paid my admission at the door, 
The gang commenced to give me a 
guy; 
Sonic fresh roJster made me get up to sing, 
And I 
sang the " Sweet By- and- By." 
The ladies all got mashed on me, 
I 
got a 
gold watch, a 
bouquet, and some rock cand 
I 
had to sing " Grandfather's Clock" and " Nancy 
The night I 
joined the T. A. B.'s. 
I 
got up to make a 
temperance speech, 
For bricks the gang made a 
rush ; 
They told me I 
was off my co base, 
And said I 
was a 
brother to jimmy Lush. 
They told me they'd get me a 
j 
b 
white-washing smoke, 
Or down in the gas house chewing coke, 
I 
fell through my pants laughing at their joke, 
The night I 
joined the T. A. B.'s. 
When I 
signed the pledge to drink no more, 
I 
thought they'd tear down the hall ; 
They waited for me at the door, 
And asked me to have a " ball." 
I 
lifted me left hand, and to the gang I 
sworet 
I'll drink McNally's fire water no more ; 
Then the clothes of my back they nearly ton, 
The night I 
joined the T. A. B.'s.

PAT O'HARA. 
I

I 
owe my breath to famout Limerick City, 
I 
can handle well the twig, or :flitter an Irish jig, 
Or give you a 
stave of a

My heart is seldom sad, I 
like to make folks glad, '

I'm the rattling, rowling, teasing Pat O'Hara.

Hurrah ! my Irish boys, that's fond of fun and noise, 
There's not from Dublin down to Connermara, 
Or from Limerick to Kildare, a 
boy that can compare 
With rattling, rowling, tearing Pat O'Hara. 
And on a 
pattern day my heart is light and gay ; 
I 
frisk across the green sod light and gayly ! 
I 
am always up to fun, but was never knowu to run, 
For that would be disgrace to my ; 
If a 
colleen, too, you see that's looking after me, 
And faix, her name is Kitty McNamara, 
With two eyes as black as sloes, that wherever Imay go, 
They are always chasing after Pat O'Haro. 
Hurrah, my Irish boys, otc. 
I 
love the Emerald sod where in childhood irst I 
trod, 
With its hills and valleys clothed in shamrocks green, 
And its colleens sweet and fair, few with them can 
compare, 
For their equal's mighty seldom to be seen : sure ; 
Though the times have changed this while in dear ould 
Erin's Isle, 
And many have had to wander near and far, oh I • 
Arrah ! just keep up your heart., you'll find that the

'Tis the style that always pleases Pat O'Hara.

BRANNIGAN'S 
PUP. 
As sung by JOHNNY ROACH with great sues. 
Now old Mickey Branuigan had a 
bull-pup, 
.11e was bred of rale elegant stock 
For seventeen hours a 
battle he fought, 
. 
He did, by my soul, by the clock. 
His tail was a 
neat little bit of a 
stump, 
Bow-legged and two crooked eyes, 
One look at his ugly looking mug was enough, 
He was the divil himself in disguise. 
CHORUS. 
Bow-ow-ow, what a pup to be sure, 
For fighting he'd never give up; 
There never was known such a 
wonderful dog, 
As Mickey Brannigan's pup. 
He tore the tail off Maloney's best coat, 
Ate the bustle of Mary Ann Flynn, 
And run between young Kitty Mulligan's legs, 
Now wasn't that truly a 
sin. 
He caught up the Dutch shoemaker's dog, 
And shook him around like a 
rat, 
He murdered Tim Finnegan's beautiful goat, 
Ate the tail of McManus' cat. 
Bow-ow- ow, what a 
pup, etc, 
An Italian came around with an organ one day, 
And a 
monkey tied fast to a 
string; 
And when the pup saw them he yowled with delighA 
And made a 
most wonderful spring. 
He upset the monkey, grinder, and all, 
And bursted the organ inside; 
And be jabers he tried to swallow the monk, 
But he choked on his tail and he died, 
Bow-ow-ow, what a 
pup, eta. 
BILLY'S REQUEST, 
Give my box and string to brother, 
Mamma, when I'm dead; 
When the sexton puts me under, 
In my little bed. 
If the job is like to throw him, 
Ere the string he jerks, 
Get some little toy to show hiali 
"How the old thing works 
Give away my my bran new Ulster, 
Hire a 
Pullman car ; 
Give me a 
bath iu Florida water, 
I 
see the gates ajar. 
Give me a 
dose of paragoric, 
There's nothing about me mean; 
Give the sexton a 
half a 
dollar, 
" 
To see that my grave's kept green." 
Let me break your china tea-set, 
Let me bust your majolica jar; 
Throw me on the terra-cotta, 
Soothe me, dear mamma. 
Fire me in a 
dumpling patch; 
Hit me with a 
pie, 
Tickle nae vrith your slippery mother, 
In the sweet-by-and-by." 
Id:LTA's REQUEST. 
Continued. 
rake me to hear Bob Ingersoll lectilse; 
Make me a 
brimstone pie, 
Let me dive in the river for salmon, 
Mamma, what do you soy ? 
Take me to an old-time clam-bake, 
Sheepshead, lobster and gin, 
Douse me in a 
watermelon, 
" 
And then wipe off my chin." 
Let me smash my little brother, 
Once btfore I 
go ; 
Let me hit him in the smeller, 
Mamma, don't say no. 
For your boy will be an angel, 
Ere the sun goes down the west, 
Let me warp his new suspenders, 
" 
And then pull down his vest." 
Give my chewing gum to sister, 
I 
don't want it more ; 
On my lips it raised a 
blister— 
They are awful sore. 
Give away my ragged jacket, 
Mamma, don't you cry, 
In the clouds I'll raise a 
racket, 
" 
How is that for high ?"

CASEY'S AWFUL GRUB. 
COMIC IRISH SONG. 
Written by litanY & Joim KERICELL. 
I 
used to live in Harlem at a 
sailor's boarding-house, 
My clothes they wouldn't fit, my form was a 
disgrace, 
I 
stopped with Michael Casey, he was a 
dandy Mick, 
But the grub upon his table, would surely make you 
sick. 
There was old rheumatic butter, there was acrobatic 
cheese, 
There was India rubber beefsteak and dislocated peas; 
The butter turned a 
flip-flap, and fell into a 
tub, 
And the boarders all fell senseless from Casey's awful 
grub. 
Murphy got the horrors from eating ginger bread, 
Miss Maloney got the jim jams, and stood upon her 
head; 
Muldoon he got the night mare, and danced around 
the floor, 
The cheese got on its dignity, and skipped right out 
the door. 
There was salt enough on the table to do a straight 
jig up !iere, 
The coffee was , .
istunpted, and too -weak to appear, 
The soup was di.m --)
ti 
and dished out of a 
tub, 
And the boarde-:,:got the heart disease from Casey's 
awful gri 
%. • 
Friday being ft day, the bill of fare was changed, 
They had bladder soup and pickles, oyster sauce and 
• brains, 
Boston beans and crackers, sour krout stuffed with 
snuff, 
Sarelines and sausages all mixed up in a 
duff. 
I 
didn't spend my week out, but a 
friend of mine who 
did, 
Died very suddenly, they surrounded Casey's crib; 
The coroner was sent for, and when he looked at the 
dead man's mug, 
said it surely wasn't suicide, but Casey's awial grub.,

Mese] f 
and Barney Casey wint to have a 
little spree, 
He had a 
bottle for himself, and another one for me, 
We traverd tound the city till our heads and feet were sore, 
And ey'ry dhrink it was so nice, it made us wish for more. 
CHORUS. 
Bad luck to Casey's whiskey, it made us both so frisky, 
dhrank our bottles empty, and at last we couldn't stand: 
Along the streets we rambled, we staggered and we scrambled, 
And sang a 
song, the whole night long, of gay ould Paddy's 
land. 
We met a 
big policeman, and he looked at us; says he, 
What brings you out so late as this?" says I, " The counthry's 
free:" 
"Shut up," says Casey, " come along!" 
0, divil a 
bit," says I. 
" 
stlirike him if he says a 
word, the dtuty mane °tad spy." 
SPOKEN.— And if I 
over did sthrike him he might well say— 
Bad luck to, etc. 
He turned around and left us—sure the man was not to blame, 
I 
called him back, awl asked him if he'd plase to tell his name. 
" 
O.. coarse," says he, " it's Flanigan; I'm from the county 
Clam," 
Hurroo!" says I, " Shake hands, me b'y, our whiskey you 
must share!" 
Bad luck to, ate. 
Out kern the empty bottle, and I 
put it in his paw, 
" 
Look out," says he, " when on me post, a 
dhrink's against the 
law." 
He put the bottle to his mouth, but divil a 
dhrop was there, 
And while we laughed at Flanigan. sure he began to swear! 
Bad luck to, etc. 
He raised his club above his head, and vowed he'd take us in 
For dhrinking on the highway, " 0," says Casey, " that's too 
thin!" 
He dhragged poor Casey off to jail, and tried to take me, too. 
Btr- to keep a 
hoult on Casey was as much as he could do. 
SPOKEN. —I 
pitied poor Casey and I 
suppose he pitied me. 
But it was all his own doings. 
The two bottles fixed him 
Bad luck to, etc.

hr DEVIL'S 
IN NEW JERSEY. 
Composed and sung by P. J. Dovomr. 
LAST Sunday morn I 
rose up, 
And I 
feeling kind of merry; 
Says I 
I'll have a 
good time, 
So I 
crossed the Jersey ferry. 
But never will I 
do the same, 
The conseqaence was frightening. 
But what can you expect of one, 
Filled up with Jersey lightening. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, you talk of this you talk of that, 
You talk of places nosey, 
13n by the— no, I 
will i 
ot swear--
The devil's in New Jersey. 
I 
ran through mud up to my eyesi 
I 
never yet was lazy ; 
A big policeman scooped me in, 
And swore that I 
was crazy. 
I 
was surrounded in the cell, 
By mosquitos a- flying, 
When morning came, from loss of blood, 
I 
thought I 
was a- dying. 
Oh, you talk of this, tte, 
When morning came, before the judge, 
He looked on me with pity ; 
Says lie, young man, the sentence is, 
One hour to leavethe city. 
I 
did not wait to hear the rest, 
You bet I 
wasn't noisy, 
When I 
arrived in York I 
cried: 
May the devil shoot New Jersey. 
Oh, you talk of this, etc. 
When I 
got home, my wife along 
With a 
big club was waiting, 
She said to lay a 
hand on me 
Her tender heart was breaking. 
We had it up and clown the floor, 
At last I 
cried for mercy, 
She yelled you fool, go anywhere, 
But keep away from Jersey. 
Oh, you talk of this, etc.

I've got a

come home from labor every day; 
My wife at me does stare when I 
sit in the chair,' 
She whispers in my ear and to me says: 
Our darling little boy the neighbors do annoy, 
lie smashed in Mrs. Murphy's window pane; 
She says she'll git a 
cop if the rascal doesn't stop„ 
Then she'll roll her arms around me and exclaim: 
CHORUS. 
Johnny, take the child across your knee, 
To-day he's been a 
bad boy to me; 
Learn him the golden rule and send him off to school, 
Arrah, Johnny take the child across your knee. 
This darling son of mine is so gentle and so kind, 
He's always playing " Duck upon the Rock ;" 
When he goes out te play, sure he's always led as-
tray, 
By all the little gossoons on the block. 
They take him* on the street and every Turk he meets, 
He fires a 
brick at him and runs away; 
Then the neighbors will complain and say that Pm 
to blame, 
Then my darling wife to me will say: 
Johnny, take the child, ete. 
My heart is heal•ly broke, since my boy commenced 
to smoke, 
You'll find him 
-bn the corner picking stumps; 
lie's acquainted with the slang, he's in with all the 
gang, 
He's always playing base ball on the dump. 
But now he's got so tall and he takes in every ball, 
And hangs out with the loafers every day; 
My wife is nearly wild since she lost her darling child, 
When I 
return from work no more she'll say: 
Johnny, take the child, etc.

Two policemen bold, as rye been told, heard hick was selling on us'

So off they- went, with full intent to get a 
bottle they did try. 
They went in then, dressed like rag-men, and took a 
seat down tio 
the shop, 
Asked Mrs. MacGee if so kind she'd be, as to give them a 
bottle st 
the real ould drop. 
Arrah, grammachree, etc. 
A 
thought struck her then, that she knew the men, and a 
big black 
bottle she went and got, 
She went into the room, saying, " I'll be back soon," and she filled II 
nicely up with slops, 
"I'll let you see," says Mrs. MacGee, " the liquor 1 
sell is the real 
ould stock" 
As she filled it right, she corked it tight, and she got two dollars for 
a 
bottle of slops. 
Arrah, grammachree, eta. 
The police in glee ran off, do you see, and stated the case to Ken 
nedy, 
Who opened his eyes at cheating the excise: " Go bring your prison-

You say she did sell," as he took a 
smell, (Phew)" and what did you 
pay for the bottle you got? 
"Two dollars," said they, "
-we had to pay.' " Why, you foolisk 
men, it's nothing but slops."

Written and sung by Ed. HARRIGAN in his popular sketch of " Who

I 
am a 
man of great influence, 
And educated to a 
high degree, 
I 
came here when small from Donegal, 
In the Daniel Webster, scross the sea, 
In the Fourteenth Ward I

In a 
tenement house with my brother Dan; 
By perseverance I 
elevated, 
And went to the front like a

CHORUS. 
Go with me and I'll treat you dacent; 
I'll set you down, and I'll fill the can; 
As I 
walk the street each friend I 
meet 
Says, " There goes Muldoon—he's a

At any party or any raffle 
I 
always go as an invited guest; 
As canspicuous as General Granite, boys;

I'm call'd upon to address the meeting, 
Without regard to clique or clan; 
I 
show the constitution with elocution, 
Bekase you know I'm a

CHORUS. 
For oppositions or politicians, 
Take my word I 
don't give a

My constituents they all go there, 
To enjoy the summer's recreation, 
And the refreshing East River air; 
Pm known in Harlem, I'm known in Jorsey, 
I'm welcomed hearty on every hand; 
Wid my regalia on Patrick's Day, 
I

In summer time when all is fine, 
And the trees and grass are green; 
When the boys are drinking lager beer, 
And everything's serene. 
On Tom McDonnell's old tin roof, 
The boys do dance at night, 
With Kitty Mal one 
and 
Mary Shea, 
Who sing with all their might. 
They have a 
big accordeon, 
The music it is grand, 
You'll hear them 
shout 
for miles away ; 
Faith, they never \ill go home, 
While tjtey can have a 
tune 
And " Tracy" on his instruments will play. 
Caortus. 
It's polkas. waltzes, quadrilles all the night, 
'Tis finer than the 4Dp'ra Bouffe ; 
If you don't, believe I'm right, call around there any night, 
And you'll find us on McDonnell's old tin roof. 
They call themselves the midnight owls, 
They dance by light of moon. 
To start for home at two o'clock, 
They say it is too soon. 
They keep the folks awake all night, 
They never have their rest, 
To sing their songs and play their tunes, 
They do their level best. 
The music it is charming, 
It really is divine, 
'Tis finer than the Op'ra Pouffe; 
When they do the Boston dip, 
Faith, the house rocks like a 
ship, 
Oh, there's no place like McDonnell's old tin rooL 
Across the street from where I 
live, 
A German keeps a 
store, 
lie is a 
baker man by trade, 
He's worth a 
th ousand 
or more. 
He keeps about five men at work, 
Of course they're up all night, 
But when they hear tile music play, 
They shout with great delight. 
About the time the bread is bak'd 
The boys and girls descend, 
They don't stop till they've reached the door; 
Then they'll nk:p across the street, 
And the bread thoy'll nip so neat, 
Oh, you ought to hear the bakers how they roar.

PADDY CAREY.

'was at the town of nate Clogheec, 
That Sergeant Snapp met Paddy Carey; 
A

Brisk as a

His brawny should( rs, four feet square, 
His cheeks like thumping red potatoes, 
His legs would make a 
chairman stare! 
And Pat was loved by all the ladies. 
Old and young, grave and sad, 
Deaf and dumb, dull or mad, 
Waddling, t 
waddling, limping, squinting, 
Light, brisk and airy— 
Ca

All the sweet faus at Limerick race, 
From Nullinavelt to Magherafelt, 
At Paddy's beautiful Millie would melt, 
The sowl would err, and look so shy, 
Och! Cnshlamachree, did you never see 
The jolly boy, the darling joy. the ladies toy 
Nimble-footed, black-eyed, rosy-cheekiid, 
Curly-headed Paddy Carey ! 
0, sweet Paddy, beautiful Paddy! 
Nate little, tight little Paddy Carey. 
His heart was made of Irish oak, 
Yet soft as streams from sweet Killarney, 
His tongue was tipped with a 
bit of the brogue, 
But the deuce a 
bit at all of the blarney. 
Now Sergeant Snapp, so sly and keen; 
While Pat was coaxing duck-legged Mary. 
A shilling slipped so nate and clime 
By the powers, lu lis'ed Paddy Carey! 
Tight, and sonnd—: .i

SLIGO MUSKETEERS.

As originally purloined from JIM O'NEAL by EDDY FISH, and sung 
with tremendous success by JOHNNY ROACH and CHARLEY 
LADENDORF. 
Now let ye stand from under, and open wide your 
ears, 
While we relate the history of the Sligo kusketeers. 
When first we landed on this soil, out West we had 
to go, 
For to work upon canaling in the state of °helm; 
And when the war it did break out, they took our 
jobs away, 
So we organized a 
company, and started for the fray. 
We fought the wild red Indian braves for many a 
weary day; 
But they couldn't beat the Sligo Musketeers. 
Cnolius. 
With me ha, ha, ha, foot straw, we marched across 
the plain, 
And many a 
weary day we thought we'd never see 
home again; 
The Indians fought like blazes, but their fighting 
was in vain, 
For they couldn't down the Sligo Musketeers. 
We fought with Banks and Burnside, with Grant 
we took a 
hack; 
But best of all though he was small, was gallant lit-
tle Mac; 
And if they'd let him have his way, the enemy he'd 
drive back. 
With the assistance of the Sligo Musketeers, 
For he knew how to engineer, and likewise take 
command, 
No matter what your station was, he'd take you by 
the hand. 
He looked so noble on his horse when he was in com-
mand, 
Of us fighting boys, the Sligo Musketeers. 
With me ha, ha, ha, etc.

do declare. 
Be my sowl 'twas a 
caution the way they wud schrarne 
Like the blast of a 
fisherman's horn; 
Says McSorley " not one blessed hour have I 
shlepi,, 
Since thin two little divils were born." 
CHORUS. 
Wid the beer and the whiskey the who blessed night, 
Faith they couldn't stand up on their pins, 
Such an elegant time at the christening we had, 
Of McSorley's most beautiful twins. 
Says Mrs. McSorley " a 
christenin' we'll have, 
Just to give me two darlin's a 
name," 
Faith we will, says MeSorley, sure one they must get, 
Something grand to be course for that same." 
Thin for Godmothers Kate and Mag Murphy stood up, 
And for Godfathers came the two Flynns, 
Johanna Maria and Diagnacious O'Mara, 
Were the names that they christened the twins. 
Whin the christenin' was ever the company begun, 
Wid god whiskey to fill up their shkins; 
And the neighbor kern in just to wish a 
good luck 
To McSorley's most beautiful twins. 
Whin ould Mrs. Mullins had drank all her punch 
Faith her legs wouldn't hould her at all; 
She fell flat on her shtomach on top av the twins, 
An they set up a 
murthern' shquall. 
Thin Mrs. McSorley jumped up in a 
rage, 
And she threatened Mrs. Mullinses life; 
Says ould Denny Mullins " I'll bate the firsht man 
That'd dar lay a 
hand an me wife!" 
The McGanns and the Geoghans they had an old 
grudge, 
And Mag Murphy pitched into the Flynns; 
They fought like the divil, turned over the bed, 
And they shmothered the poor little twins.

THE NIGHT THAT JOHN lifcCARTITY HOCKED 
HIS WATCH. 
Written by HARRY BumrsTr and sung by JOHN JEER/MM. 
It was on a winter evening in the merry month of 
June, 
The gang all congregated in a 
lager bier saloon; 
They were going on a Jamboree, the reason I'll tell 
soon, 
And McCarthy payed for drinks for every one; 
He was working in a 
dollar store at fifty cents a 
day, 
But one fine night he got so tight, he gave himself 
away; 
The boss did then discharge him, and he didn't get his 
pay, 
And that's the reason why he had to hock his watch. 
CHORUS. 
But such a 
night and such a 
fight I 
never saw before, 
The gang got full of beer and ruin and through the 
street did roar; 
McNulty got so paralyzed he tumbled through the 
floor, 
On the night that John McCarthy hocked his watch. 
O'Brien came home staving, and unto his wife says 
he, 
"Do you go get a 
quart of beer, and bring it home to 
me;" 
She says, " I'll take your wages, or you'll very quickly 
see 
Yourself lie sprawling on the floor." 
He put up his hands to strike her, when she hit him 
such a 
whack 
Right underneath his seventh rib, that you could hear 
it crack ; 
He fell down the cellar and he nearly broke his back, 
On the night that John McCarthy hocked his watch. 
But such a 
night, etc. 
THE PALACE UPON THE ROCKS. 
Written and sung by JACK CONROY. 
Pat McAllister of Harlem Flats 
Presents himself to you; 
And whin he has on his Hibernian dress 
He is a 
masher too. 
A widdy fell in love with me, 
In Erie she has stocks. 
She has a 
palace at Central Park, 
Built upon the rocks. 
SPOKEN. — And every Sunday, dresstiel in my cross-
grain de Bashall suit, I 
visit the little palace, chat 
love for awhile, she then calls her only son in a 
musi-
cal son in a 
musical voice, and says— 
CHORUS. 
Paddy come here to your mother, 
That's the darlin' dear, 
Don't you cause any bother, 
Run out for a 
quart of beer. 
Don't go near the Dutchman's avick, 
You know he is a 
skin. 
But go around where it is cheaper and better, 
Go around to Teddy McGlynn. 
I've taken her over to Hoboken 
On many a 
summer's day, 
And there upon the Elysian Fields, 
Our figures we'd display. 
Her's was nate and trim, me boys, 
Three-fifty was her weight, 
She'd make me stand outside of the boat, 
For she wouldn't fit in a 
sate. 
Paddy come here to your mother, etc. 
In a 
snug retreat at Central Park, 
We wint one beautiful night. 
An' there we had a 
jug of the best, 
Both of us got tight. 
A policeman he came along, 
And the both of us took away, 
And next morning down at the Tombs 
I 
had both fines to pay. 
Paddy conic here to your mother, etc.

PEOPLE WILL TALK. 
Written Composed and Sung by PETE CANNOX. 
• 
As you go through this world many troubles you'll see, 
But take the world easy and do just like me. 
You'll meet with your enemies every day, 
And your secrets to others they'll quickly betray; 
But take my advice, and don't mind what they say, 
People will talk, you know. 
CHORUS. 
Yes, people will talk, 
People will talk, you know, 
For they've got to have something to say. 
If you're seen walking out with a 
lady at night, 
The people will say that there's something not right; 
They'll follow you 'round to a 
party or ball, 
With fierce imprecations as bitter as gall, 
And they'll tell what you done when you didn't at all, 
For people will talk you know. 
Yes, people will talk, etc. 
May I 
take Mary Ann to a 
picnic, Mrs. Dunn, 
Its there we'll have singing and dancing and fun. 
M=. Dunn will reply with a 
terrible yell, 
Before she could go I 
would see her to — 
Since she went to the last one she hasn't been well, 
And people will talk you know. 
Yes, people will talk, eta. 
And now I'll conclude with my silly song, 
I 
hope in the Lcrd I've not kept you too long, 
not be surprised if I 
hear some one say, 
Come take a 
back seat, you're too long in the way, 
But I 
can't please you all if I'd sing ' till I'm gray, 
For people will talk you know.

BALE MeMULLIN STYLE. 
Words by 
HAnalGAN. 
Musk by JOHN BRAHANI 
Stage representations only by consent of the author 
OH ! I 
am a 
rale descindent of McMullin from Glendon., 
For beauty and education the McMullin's bate them all, 
The name is handed down from the days of Adam's time, 
Wid the greatest admiration, I 
claim the name as mine. 
Cnoutts. 
For 1 
walk wid stately tread, I 
keep up my noble head, 
I'm a 
credit to my country, Erin's Isle ; 
McMullin is my name, without any fear or shame, 
I'd stand out here forninst you in the rale McMullin style. 
My father °len tould me to never tell a 
lie, 
I 
will alway help a 
beggar if I 
saw him passing by, 
Be free and independent as the bird that flies the air, 
Let my heart be like a 
dove and my spirit like a 
bear. 
For I 
walk wid stately tread, etc. 
Mr. Shakespeare's brain said there's nothing in a 
name, 
But he was a 
total stranger to McMullin all the while, 
For if he'd lived to- day, one thing he'd surely say, 
There's nothing can conTare, my boys, to rale McMullin style, 
For I 
walk wid stately tread, etc. 
My father's blood is in my veins, and McMullin is my name, 
It's known from Ireland unto the river Nile, 
And when you have bad luck, don't cry out like a 
duck, 
But put your shoulder to it yri the rale McMullin style. 
For I 
walk wid stately tread, ate.
