Good afternoon and thank you so much for taking part in this important historical project 
with the Library of Congress. I think it's late morning, so we get close to noon. So, anyway, 
would you kindly give me your complete name and the year that you were born?
GL
Gevona Lawton and my birthday is 1974.
CH
Okay, you got a birthday coming up soon.
GL
Yeah, it's real soon.
CH
What city and state do you live in?
GL
I stay in Apple Valley, California.
CH
Okay. You know, I'm just used to hearing about Los Angeles and I never heard there was a 
city, Apple Valley.
GL
Yeah, it's a city. I've been learning a lot about the city. So, I guess this is, like, a popular place 
where they used to harvest apples.
CH
Okay.
GL
Where I am in Apple Valley is like 35 minutes from Big Bear.
CH
Okay. Where were you born and raised?
GL
Los Angeles, California [laughs].
CH
Okay.
GL
Yes.
CH
You're a L.A. girl.
afc2021009_007
GL
L.A.
CH
Your family dynamic, your parents and do you have siblings?
GL
Mmhmm. I have me from my mother. I have a twin sister and then I have a younger brother
that's eight years younger. Then, 'cause my stepfather raised me, so I have five other siblings
from him. So, it's, like, a total of four girls, four boys.
CH
Did you grow up with all of them?
GL
Mmhmm. Yeah, I grew up with all of them.
CH
Your parents, what did they do?
GL
My mother, she didn't finish high school but my father, he finished high school. My
stepfather finished high school and then my biological father, he did some college for his
bachelor's.
CH
What or who inspired you to become a nurse?
GL
My mother. My mother. I lost my mother, so losing her and being naive to the healthcare
system, and I felt that the treatment that we received at that time wasn't the best and I just
vowed to myself, I didn't want nobody to go through what I went through and feel like that,
and feel, you know, vulnerable and helpless, you know. I'm saying, at a time when you really
need some help, you know, we didn't get any resources or anything ‘cause we were young.
We were, like, 22 and my brother was, like, eight years younger than us and so we didn't have
anybody in the family that had the medical background that can help us through it, nor did we
have-- They didn’t offer resources to us that could help us, like, with counseling and stuff like
that that they should have done. And, you know, just the whole process of my mom being
sick, ‘cause it was, like, a short period. It happened suddenly. It was a rough nine months and
then she passed away.
CH
So, advocacy is a pretty strong point in your nursing practice.
GL
Yes, it is.
CH
Tell me about your nurse education and your matriculation.
afc2021009_007
GL
My nurse education, it was interesting [laughs] ‘cause I didn't have any medical background,
so I felt like I was up against a lot of my classmates that did have, like, different types of
medical background. I literally was doing natural hair. I was doing locks. Then, before that, I
was taking, like, little jobs here and there, but I was always in management type positions and
helping other people, customer service and stuff like that. So, I always liked helping people,
you know, but that inspiration really came from my mother to go in that direction. So, going
to school, it was interesting ‘cause it was a challenge for me. I like challenges, but going
through the program, I ended up being, like, the student nursing rep for my class for three
years, for my bachelor's and for my associate’s. I was nominated for that as well as the vice
president of the Nursing Club in my associate’s program. So, yeah, it was like, I went in, like,
“I have no idea. Am I sure this is what I want to do?” and, you know, over, like, a course of,
like, the first semester or so, I just, you know, got right into it and everything worked out. It
was challenging but it was still good.
CH
Where did you go to school?
GL
I went to Los Angeles Trade Tech for my ADN and then I went to Cal State Los Angeles
University for my Bachelor's in Nursing and now I’m at Walden for my master’s, for Psych
NP.
CH
Psych-- NP stands for...?
GL
Oh, nurse practitioner.
CH
And ADN stands for…?
GL
Associate's Degree in Nursing.
CH
Okay, alright. You know, we know those terms.
GL
Yeah.
CH
But everybody else, you know, might not know and so this is, like, a educational process, so
we want to make sure that everyone, you know, is comfortable with the terms that we are
using. How long have you been a nurse?
GL 05:57
About, I would say, since 2018.
afc2021009_007
CH
Okay.
GL
So, I started off working, like, literally, that was interesting because, like, with all the high
demand, the shortage of nurses, and it was a class of 34 of us that graduated from my
associate's program but it was hard. The demand in L.A., ‘cause I was still in L.A. at that
time, the demand for nursing was still high, was still congested, so it was a lot of us coming
out of school and they had all these jobs, but they wanted you to have so much experience or
they wanted-- It was magnet hospitals, meaning you need a bachelor's to get into those
hospitals, but it still was limited. It was limited slots for new graduates. So, they’ll have like,
some places I had applied to would have, like, 20 slots for new grads but then it's 100
applicants, so it was slim to none to get in, like, and when I moved up this way to the high
desert-- That's where Apple Valley is. It’s in the high desert. So, when I moved up there,
literally, I switched over my [inaudible 7:22] and put my address and location out here and I
was employed within, like, less than 30 days, compared to being in L.A., it was, like, still,
like, six months that I was still looking for employment. But, the very first job that I got was
a senior nursing facility as a RN supervisor, and then from there, I still was applying for acute
care to get into the hospitals.
CH
So, you started out your first nursing experience, you were a manager?
GL
Yes.
CH
What was that like?
GL
It was very scary [both laugh] ‘cause I can't say I'm doing nursing for a few years. They don't
train, like, in the senior nursing facilities. They're always short RN’s so, with that being said,
they don't have the proper resources all the time to properly train the RN’s that come in.
Usually, the RN’s that are more seasoned, they don't go to those facilities for employment
because the pay is low, you know, so when they do get the RN’s over there, they, you know,
have limited amount of time before they can train you, so I think my training was all of seven
days. I think the training was all of seven days and it really wasn't training. It was really just,
like, “These are different departments. These are all the people that you have under you. Here
you go,” [both laugh]. “Here’s your med cart and you do the IV’s and assessments and all that
stuff and they do the other stuff and you oversee all them and any change of conditions.” I'm
like, “Okay,” and so, literally, I think it's because of my personality, I was able to manage
because I had that already. But, while I was there, the staff knew I was new so, of course,
they’re coming to me because I'm the person that they need to talk to and I would literally
have to ask them, “Okay, I need you to help me help you.” So, that's how I was able to, you
know, get my experience together with them, because I'm like, “You’re coming to me with
your complaints or whatever your needs are, but I need to understand what your position is
because nobody told me how your position functions,” ‘cause we didn't work in-- Going to
school, we went to a senior facility briefly, you know. We wasn't in the senior facilities like
that so I needed to know, you know, exactly, “Okay, how can I help you?” you know. I'm
saying, “What do I need to do so I can get the resources to properly assist you, you know,
afc2021009_007
with whatever you need?” So, that's how I learned, you know, while I was on the floor. It was
crazy [laughs].
CH
How do you think you did with it?
GL
I think I did good because, literally, they still want me back and, you know, I think after a few
months, once I, you know, got a handle of everything and how the system worked and
everything, I was able to navigate and get everything, you know, done. So, it got to the point
where when they see me, any staff, it didn't matter if it was the janitors, any staff,
maintenance or whatever, they see me on the floor, they was like, “Oh, Gevona’s here.” They
call me G, so they’re like, “G’s here? Oh, we're good. Everything's gonna be taken care of
tonight,” you know. So, they didn't have to worry about it, so they looked forward to when
they seen me because they knew that I would take care of things on the floor and it wasn't,
like, you know, they still have to pick up and they're behind, you know. I will get you so far,
because I went from being full-time to per diem, which is, you know, probably once a week
or whenever need be, you know, ‘cause I was starting working at the hospital. But anyway, it
was just like, “Oh, yeah. It's gonna get taken care of. Just let her know.” I had to quit because
I'm, like, I'm about to start school and, you know, in the process of me going there, you know,
I'm cleaning up, like, whatever is going on. They can give me the problems or situations and I
can clean it up and delegate it properly. So, by the time they come back the next day or the
two days that I'm there or one day that I'm there, you know, I can get things taken care of for
them until I come back the next time and they can pick up from there and be okay, you know.
But, I was like, “I can't. I'm, like, working full-time at the hospital and then coming over here,
giving you guys 10 to 12 hours a day too. I can't do it. I can't do it anymore.” It was just too
much.
CH 12:30
The transition to acute care practice, what was that like?
GL
That was great. That process was good, because I literally signed up. It’s called the Transition
to Practice, Transition into Practice. It's called the TIP program that they offered at
Providence, St. Mary's. So, basically, it’s anyone that is a new graduate coming into the
nursing care or if you were, let me see, if you were coming from another department, another
specialty, you know, and transitioning over to another specialty. Like, say you were in med
surg and then you transferred over and wanting to go to labor and delivery, you would be able
to go through the TIP program because it's a training. So, you'll get, like, six months to a
year, depending on if you were a new grad or a specialty, ‘cause you can go to ICU, ‘cause
ICU is a part of that. So, I know that ICU program is a year. So, you have classes and stuff
that you have to attend. You get a preceptor that works with you for, like, 16 weeks to, you
know, navigate you through and help you out with the floor and everything. Then, you get,
you know, it's like class, so you have regular classes and groups that you have to attend for
that year and you graduate out and then you're on your own. You actually start on your own I
would say probably after the 16 to 18 weeks of working in the program, you're already
transferred out. So, when I got there, my first day of employment was January 27th of 2020,
yeah. So, it was January 27th of 2020. So, of course I was new and everybody was like,
‘cause I had the senior skill facility experience, so they was like, “Oh, you're experienced.”
I'm like “No, post-acute. That's where you send them afterwards, you know. They go to
afc2021009_007
hospitals. This is different.” So, and I worked in the telemetry department, which is dealing
with hearts, monitoring the hearts and stuff. So, after, I would say, three to four months,
COVID hit. So, I was still, like that transition through my mentor, precepting, then from that,
I started working on the floor on my own, getting my rhythm and everything. Then, we
started getting COVID patients. Everybody was freaking out, because I had a lot of seasoned
nurses I was working with and everybody was amazing, very helpful or whatever, but they
were putting the patients where, you know, in isolation areas at a hospital. This is when the
numbers were still low, and they weren't giving us as new grads those patients, which was
great. So, that first wave, I was, “Phew. Thank God. Went right over our head.” Then, the
second wave hit much harder than the first wave. Our hospital is 212 beds, so we had
probably 180 beds that were COVID. We were converting rooms to isolation rooms because
we didn't have any space for ‘em. I called our ER “World War Ten” [both laugh] ‘cause we
were converting our-- Oh my god. It was horrible. So, we was converting our emergency
room into, like, the lobbies and everything into, like, isolation rooms or, like, and it was
literally not even enough space. We needed more isolation rooms, more ICU rooms. Our beds
was full. We was running out of ventilators and so, like, on my floor, the [inaudible 17:08]
floor, our whole floor went to COVID, like, in days. Like, we went from being in ratio and
then, you know. I was loving the fact that I can work three days straight. I loved my 12-hour
shifts for three days straight and I'm off for four days. Then, I was, like, I started doing it, you
know, ‘cause we were so scheduling. So, I was like, “Oh, you know what? I'm gonna try to
do, like, the beginning and end of the week, ‘cause then I can do six days straight and then I
can be off for 8 days and it's like a mini vacation, you know.” So, I was like, “Okay.” So, I
tried it. I set it up before COVID when put our time in. When COVID, the second wave, hit,
my six days came up. So, the very first day I work I was in ratio. The second day, we were in
ratio but we didn't have any aides on the floor.
CH
What does “in ratio” mean?
GL
In ratio for our hospital, for telemetry, for med surg it’s five patients to one nurse and for
telemetry it’s four patients to one nurse and then ICU is one to two patients to one nurse. So,
we were in ratio, but usually, like, our particular hospital, ‘cause I know some hospitals, they
say they don’t have CNAs on the floor and they do total care, meaning that they're
responsible for all the care for the patients, but our hospital has CNA's.
CH
The CNA’s are…?
GL
Certified Nursing Assistants. So, they would be able to help us on a floor with cleaning up
the patients, with patients that are bedbound or, you know, helping ambulate the patients to
the bathroom or just doing those little things that helped so much. CNAs are like angels.
CH
Absolutely.
GL
Lord, they are. So, like, we went from ratio with help on the floor and then we also have a
resource nurse. So, a resource nurse is a RN which is an extra nurse. If, like, it's nine RN’s--
afc2021009_007
Say your staffing would be 11. Like, ours was 11 for our unit, so we had nine nurses on the
floor with four patients each. Then, we would have one of the nurses would be our charge
nurse and then the other nurse would be the resource nurse, which is a RN too that just
doesn't have any assigned patients to her. She's helping all of the other nine nurses and a
charge nurse on the floor with anything that needs to be done so that our floor can run okay.
Also, we'll have CNAs. So, we would run the first day being okay to the second day not
having resource or having CNAs on the floor and we had to do total care, meaning we had to
take all of our own vital signs and do everything. Then, by my third day of that six days, we
were completely out of ratio. We did not have a resource nurse, we did not have CNAs on the
floor, and we did not have a charge nurse. Our charge nurse had to pick up patients because
we were that short. Then, we had six patients to one, and I felt that it was very, very unsafe
and, you know, to me, even though I was grateful to have the team that I had, but even
though, it still was not a safe situation. We had to do-- They call it “crisis charting”, because
there's no way that we can be able to chart and do all the regular stuff that we would do daily
for our patients. We went from actually giving quality care to literally making sure you can
breathe through COVID, literally, ‘cause it's, like, the med surg is lower than telemetry.
Where I work is, like, medium and then ICU is the next step up, so when you leave me,
you're going to ICU, you know, so, you know, we're literally trying to keep people-- Like, we
have literally on the floor, we have patients that should be ICU patients, but because of  the
critical care of COVID patients, they had to, you know, figure out which was more critical for
an ICU situation. So, we literally had ICU patients on our floor. Like, I was grateful for the
instructors that I had going through my nursing program ‘cause they always told us, “If you
don't feel safe, you don't have to accept an assignment. If you don't feel that you're
comfortable with it, you don't have to accept it.” Literally, that was the first time in my whole
life. I haven't had to do it since. When I went through COVID, I was refusing care. I was
refusing care. Like, literally they was bringing me patients that were having labored breathing
and I’m looking at the monitors and the monitor’s just all over. We call it “compensating”,
when your body is just trying to fix itself and everything is abnormal and, you know. So, one
of these patients came. They were trying to give a patient to me and, like, I'm looking at this
patient. I'm like, “By the time you give me report and tell me what's going on with this
patient, this patient is gonna code. I am not accepting this patient. This patient is an ICU
patient and that is above my scope of practice so you guys need to figure it out,” [laughs].
They was looking at me like I was crazy, but I was like, “No.”
CH
And by “code”, you mean the person was starting to die or was going to die?
GL
Yea, starting to die. The change of condition is happening, you know. They might be losing
consciousness. Their blood pressure might be too low, abnormal, the breathing, or it just
stops. Everything just stops because the body is working so hard to compensate that the body
gets tired and just stops working, you know. It's just like when we work out, you know, and I
would say when we work out and there's a certain level, like, even when you, you know,
doing weight training or something like that, your body, your muscles get fatigued and
regardless of how far you want to push it, your muscles are gonna say, “Stop it,” you know.
It's the same way the body as a whole works with the different organ systems. Once they get
tired of overcompensating in those areas, they start to shut down, you know, and we have
monitors that can show us all that stuff. I'm telling you, it looked, like, when you look at the
monitor of that particular patient, that's all I could see. I wasn't, like, seasoned enough to
understand all the different dynamics, but what I can see is this wasn't good [both laugh].
afc2021009_007
CH
How did that situation turn out?
GL
Okay, so the nurse, she was a new grad too. She came through the TIPs program with me.
She was an ER nurse. So, when she came to me, I was like, “I'm sorry, you know, not gonna
do it.” She was like, “I completely understand.” I said, “You're gonna have to call a rapid."
We have a rapid response team. So, the rapid response team is the people, like, in the ICU
area that would go assess all the patients that are having a change of condition if it's
something above-- to get orders that's above my scope of practice. So, they would come to
assess the patient if there’s orders that needed to be got that I wouldn't be able to get, you
know, an emergency situation, they can do it for me, and, you know, with that emergency
response. So, I told her that, “That's what you're gonna need to do. You're gonna have to call
the rapid response nurse and, you know, she's gonna have to, you know, take care of this
situation,” ‘cause I'm like, “By time I-- I'm gonna be doing it, so there's no reason for you to
give me the patient and you already know what the patient care is, so that I can be sitting here
like, ‘I'm not so sure,’ you know.” So, she called the rapid response nurse. The rapid response
nurse’s like, “Oh, no. She's okay.” She said, “Oh, no. She's okay.” She said, “I think she's just
a little anxious for, you know, the transfer.” I was like, “She only went, like, 100 feet,” you
know, ‘cause we were still all in the ER area, in a different area. I said, “No. She is
compensating and this is a problem.” So, I ended up going ahead and taking the patient and
the rapid response nurse said she would, you know, come back to, you know, put her on her
rounds and come back and keep an eye on her for me. Literally, by the time the rapid
response nurse left, I caught a code, ‘cause the patient literally-- The monitors were still
doing all the same stuff but her respirations just started going lower and lower and I was
getting more and more anxious. I just called a rapid and they ended up doing exactly what I
told them. She was like, “You were right.” I said, “Yes! I told you guys this was an ICU
patient.” So, I called the family, let them know what was going on. We had to intubate her
and she went back over to the ICU department. I don't know what happened to her ‘cause it
was so much going on at that time, but I made sure that she was okay while she was in my
care. I was like, “You're not gonna stop breathing on my watch.”
CH
Great assessment skills. Great assessment skills.
GL
Yeah, and that was the thing--
CH
TIP graduate.
GL 27:34
Yes, it was, and that's what everybody was saying. They was like, “Oh my God.” They was
like, “You called it. You called it,” and I was like, “It's my gut,” and, you know, it’s one thing,
like, even with me, like, now, when I precept nurses, new grads and stuff, I'm like, “I am not
God and I am human, just like every other nurse in here. Don't take my word. Just because
I'm precepting you, don't take my word for being the gold standard or whatever. You know
your scope of practice. You know what you need to be doing and, you know, I'm here to
guide you through this.” And, you know, my motto when I train new grads or whatever is
“trust but verify.” So, that's what I teach them, trust but verify, ‘cause you will get reports and
afc2021009_007
half the stuff might be true, half of it not, or it might not go in depth enough of what you
need. So, trust but verify. Look up everything. Never believe firsthand from a person that's
telling you something, because you never know. You never know until you check it yourself.
CH
You’re a wise and prudent nurse, even though you've been a nurse for four years! That is
wonderful, and that certainly is an integral part of our nursing practice is that you make
assessments and you put your plan together and you execute your plan. The other thing is,
you really have to stand your ground.
GL
Yes.
CH
And shoot your guns.
GL
In times like that, too, going through-- when I would have to call a rapid because I had a
change of condition, heart rate changes, arrhythmias or whatever, and I literally work nights,
so of course, doctors are not available and they don't want to answer they phone, so when you
do get ‘em on the phone, some of ‘em are really good. It's, like, you go very far left and very
far right. There is no in between. So, sometimes when you call the doctors, the doctors are,
you know, be like, “Okay. What's going on?” You give them the assessment and they give
you orders. Other doctors, you can't get ‘em on the phone. You have to call supervisors, you
know, so that they can get ‘em on the phone and then when they do get on the phone-- I had
one doctor, literally, my patient had a abnormal rhythm that was particularly-- could be
deadly and when I called him, you know, we got orders from the rapid and everything but I
needed more orders that he needed to give me, and when I called him-- I called him, like,
about three or four times over what protocol was and I was like, “Look.” I called the
supervisor for the hospital and they called him ‘cause they have direct numbers for him. So,
they called him and he called me back and he was so angry. He was so angry. He was like,
“So, why are you calling me in the middle of the night?” and I was like, “Well excuse me, for
your patient,” and I told him what happened and he was like, “Oh,” and I was like, “I don't
have a reason to want to just call you at two o'clock in the morning. I would like to be asleep
myself, doctor” [both laugh]. Okay, so I'm like, “I just need to update you. I need orders. I
need this.” He apologized at the end of the conversation, but yeah, some of them, yeah, they
just, yeah, they could be a mess and them some of ‘em were really good, you know. They
look for you to call them, you know, even when you’re like, “No. This can wait until the
morning,” you know. I've gotten chewed out from a doctor, you know, something simple and
I called him to get orders and then, you know, he came in in the morning, you know, and
there was something that could wait, but he was still like, “Why didn't you call me back?”
and I'm like, “Because it wasn't, like, a near dire emergency. It was something that we could
have took care of in the morning and I knew you were coming in, so I didn't want to bother
you,” but he wanted to be bothered, you know, so it's just learning the different structures
with the different doctors and what their requirements and needs are, I will say, personally,
with each one of them, you know, yeah, ‘cause each doctor is so different from the next. So
yeah, it’s just learning the different ones and how to, you know, handle ‘em and get the stuff
that you need.
afc2021009_007
CH
So, on top of being concerned about your critical patient, you also have to be concerned about
your interaction with the provider. That is quite a task to try to learn everybody's personality,
so I applaud you for that, because I would not be trying to know everybody's personality, you
know. We have to communicate.
GL
Right.
CH
You know, we are taking care of this person's life.
GL
Right.
CH
And life is not nine to five.
GL
No.
CH
Life is 24 hours. That's why I am here working on the night shift.
GL
Yes, it never ceases to be so crazy but, you know, you have some that are good and some
that-- You know, when you get your-- We call it “the run”, your assignment, you know when
you get it ‘cause you know who's your doctor, and sometimes you go, “Oh! Please Lord. Let
everything be okay,” you know, and you're trying to make sure that you get everything, you
know, possibly that you could possibly think of so that you can call at a decent time before,
you know, if anything, you know, arises or whatever, you know.
CH
And that really so unfortunate because, again, life happens 24 hours. So, one of the main
dynamics in nursing practice is that provider-nurse interaction and relationship. I think that
that can make or break some nurses, you know. Some nurses may just be like, “Forget it, you
know. I'm not dealing with these personalities,” although it has gotten a lot different from--
You know, I'm a dinosaur nurse, so it's gotten a lot different I feel, those relationships. You
talked about the patient you had who had to be intubated. That means they had to go on the
ventilator?
GL
Yeah, they had to go on the ventilator.
CH
Being a frontline nurse during the pandemic, what effect has it had on you?
GL 34:28
I think it made me a better nurse. It's two parts, which I would say, both of them I'm grateful
for. So, I'm grateful to the fact that I didn't burn out like a lot of nurses did, because even with
afc2021009_007
me coming out of school as a new grad and going through COVID, a lot of the people that
went through my program either quit nursing altogether, quit the job and chose to do
something else besides the bedside care or are still there but you can tell that they're burnt out
because the quality of care that they provide, you know, to the patients, you know, or just
dealing with just the facility as a whole, you know, you can see it, you know. You can see
with the new ones and you can see it with the seasoned nurses too. A lot of seasoned nurses,
either they caught COVID and, you know, left or they're still out or they just decided to do
something else, you know, because, you know, or they're retiring ‘cause they were close to
that anyway, so they just did early retirement so they wouldn't have to deal with it. But, I'm
grateful because I feel like it made me a better nurse. One of my instructors, her name was
Dr. Kim Kendricks. Yeah, Dr. Kendricks. She used to always tell us-- She was a advanced
med surg and ICU nurse so she used to do our clinical. At school, you know, when we used to
do work with the mannequins and she would put us in critical situations and stuff like that,
and her thing all the time, that's all she would say to us, “Okay nurse. Whatcha gonna do?
Whatcha gonna do, nurse? Okay, this happened. Whatcha gonna do?” Throughout the whole
pandemic, that's all I heard: “What are you gonna do? What are you gonna do? What did you
learn? What critical, you know, assessment can you give these patients? How can you help
this patient?” That's all I heard and, you know, it has helped me, you know, assess my
patients better, you know, do time management better with them and also, it made me a
stronger nurse. But, what I'm also grateful for is that going through that even, you know, it
was rough, I didn't get burned out. Like, you know, it was crazy, you know, and I could feel
the burn, but it didn't burn me out, like, to the point where I don't feel happy to go to work or,
you know, happy to give, you know, a patient care and like, “Alright, here you go,” you
know, “Let me give you whatever you need,” you know, like I see what some nurses that are
burnt out. I'm like, “Why don't you just find something else to do?” you know. I'm saying to
myself, it's like, you know, I can see the burnout, you know, but, you know, some people
financially can't get off the floor so, you know, this is what they deal with and this is what,
you know, colleagues deal with and the patient care suffers. So, you know, I'm grateful that it
didn't put me there, you know, to the point where it didn't hurt me, you know, where I feel
that it wouldn't be a good situation for my patients, you know, ‘cause that's the most
important part is to provide the care, quality, 100% care, ‘cause that's what we suffer with.
So, a lot of tears came from going through COVID was we couldn't give people quality care.
So, us as nurses, we, like, when you see it on TV, that was real, you know, going through the
care and watching these people die or watching these people suffer, you know, and you
listening to all the politics of people not wanting to wear masks, not wanting to get
vaccinated, you know, just the controversy with everything, while we're sitting there
watching, trying to make sure that you stay breathing, you know, dealing with the emotional,
the mental issues and whatever because, you know, people are not used to being on oxygen.
People are not used to being on BiPap machines which is forcing air, you know, into you, you
know. It's very uncomfortable. So, they were having anxiety, anxious, you know. You getting
patients that’s regularly, you know, we call them “frequent fliers,” the ones that come all the
time.  You get those that come in and those were just dying. And that was another thing. The
senior facility that I worked at was less than five miles from the hospital. So, I had left the
senior facility but while I was rotating, you know, ‘cause they float us, meaning that every so
many days, it'd be your turn to go to another department, you know, wherever they need help.
Usually when we floated, it would be, like, every 45 to 60 days, but during COVID, it was
every other day. So, literally, you'll go down to ER to float, to help with, you know, the holds,
the bed holds and stuff like that, and I seen, like, just walking through getting meds or getting
different things that I needed, I will see, like, half of my senior facility was in there, you
know, and are going there today. Today is my Monday and then, you know, I'll go back to the
afc2021009_007
floor and then by the time I come back for the following week, you know, I go back down
there so, you know, I could have had a patient-- You know, one of the guys I had, he was a
older guy and he was so sweet and all he did was color on his tablet. Sweetest man ever. So,
when I had him, I was doing everything I could, you know, to [inaudible 40:44]. He was like,
you know, “Please don't let me die. I’m an older man,” and I'm like, “I'm doing whatever I
can to help you.” And, you know, got all the things I could do for my time, ‘cause it was
24-hour care, and by the time I came back that following week, he was on a ventilator. He
was on a ventilator. So, it was just, like, those things, going through COVID was rough, you
know. It was just, like, super rough when you see these people that I would sit and have cards
with you or, you know, when I was working at the senior facility, you know, and I'm now
seeing them all just coming here. 99% of time, going through COVID, when we had the
crisis, I don't know if they were saying it on the news, but 90% of the time, 99% of the time
that they were coming in, we did everything. We fought for everybody that came through
there. That's why it was so rough. If you got intubated, you are not coming off that ventilator.
Literally, ICU nurses, the rapid response teams would come and, like, we had our COVID
patients that was on BiPap machines, which is the last step before you get intubated, and they
would come and we would be sitting there talking to these people, you know, to let ‘em
know, like, this person was completely healthy. Now we need to see if you want to be a DNR,
you know, which is “Do Not Resuscitate,” because, you know, is nothing much more that we
can do, you know, to try to help you and save your life if you cannot breathe and if we don't
have the proper resources to make sure that you're gonna be okay, you know, and that's where
the shortage was. Like, it was so many times. I'm not, like, you know, I do social media but
not like that, but it was so many times where I just wanted to go live and just scream and just
tell people to stay at home. Like, you don't understand what we see every single day. Do you
know why you're like, “It's not that serious”? It's serious. It’s, you know, “I don't need a
mask. I do need a mask. You know, I don't care about vaccine. I do.” It was just so crazy.
Like, you know, it was rough. Like in the beginning, I was just like, “Oh no. We got this,”
you know, ‘cause I'm very supportive of my team and colleagues and stuff, you know, and
they started crying for me and I'm real sensitive. I'm like, “No. We got this!” Then, just one
day, one of my patients, she broke me down because her husband was there. I had him, like,
the week before and when I came back, he was doing well. He was on the BiPap,
comfortable. Like, that's the first one I've seen that was actually, like, applying and just chill.
When I came back, he was not doing too well. He was still on the BiPap machine. He started
getting to the point where you'd have to prone, meaning that they want you to lay on your
stomach so that you can get more oxygen to your lungs and through your bloodstream. He
couldn't do it. He couldn't do it, and he would just like, “I'm not doing that. I can't. It's too
much,” you know, to the point that when we talked to him, you know, let them know, like, “If
you can't do this, this is the last resort to save your life, and if you can't do it, it's just gonna
get worse,” you know, and he was like, you know, “I'm just gonna have to deal with that.” He
was alert, oriented, so we couldn’t make him, you know. We can’t just turn him over, you
know, and he was like, “No. Just make me a DNR.” You know, and we knew that, like, if you
do that, that's gonna help your oxygen so much and you'll probably be on this BiPap just a
little while longer and then you'll be off, you know, ‘cause he got all the therapy and he was,
like, he was tired. He couldn't do it anymore. I think he was, like, about 70. So his wife-- And
that was another thing about COVID, and it’s like, you know, nobody can come in and see
they families. We only can give you updates on the phone and, you know, by the time your
family member is deteriorating, it’s literally, like, you better run. You better speed run
because we don't know how much longer they're gonna have. So, that was, like, another
thing, like, with COVID. It's, like, we're your family. We're the last person that you may be
able to see, you know, before your family can come up here. That was still rough because--
afc2021009_007
That was giving me anxiety because, literally, you know, we don't let you in because of
COVID but then we’re letting you in when they're, you know, dying or whatever, but they
don't have the proper PPE ‘cause we barely had it. So, not only am I having anxiety about
keeping your family member, you know, stable or whatever, but now I'm having anxiety
about you because I'm like, you might be back within, like, the next week in the same bed!
You know, we had whole families getting wiped out. Whole families, like the whole family
was getting wiped out just for one mistake. One person was younger or something like that
and brought it home, you know. The multi-family homes had, you know, had like two
families or have the grandparents and stuff like that and they had the younger ones that’s in
they 20s, 30s that’s out hanging out partying and stuff like that come home, or when friends
come by, they sick, thinking it’s allergies or a cold, and then got everybody in the house sick,
and probably the person that brought it home is the one that survived and everybody else is
dead. It was rough. It was really, yeah. It was rough. But, those experiences helped me, you
know. Now, like, when I'm doing my nursing and especially when, you know, it gives me
better-- it's easier assessments [laughs]. I would say that it’s a easier assessment, more
patients, but it gives me that-- I appreciate the fact that I have it ‘cause now when I'm, you
know, advocating for my patients when they don't even know how to advocate for themselves
or when I'm educating them about some stuff or whatever and they still don't understand it, I
can give them, you know, scenarios of what I’ve experienced. Like, “It can go left or it can go
right. The decision is yours, but I just want to put everything out here on the table so that you
know, you know, firsthand of, like, what compliant and non-compliant looks like for you,”
you know. I mean, it's worked out so much better, you know, and I like it a lot better. I'm not
happy COVID is [inaudible 47:47], but I like it a lot better because it just made me more
seasoned, I feel, within my career, you know, ‘cause you always take away a story, you know,
so it just gave me so many different things that, you know, ‘cause your patient care is never
the same. Everybody's individual, so those stories helped me with something with everyone,
so it's really helpful. I appreciate it.
CH
I can see that that experience for you was traumatic. It was emotional for you and you feel
very passionate about the service that you give and the care that you give to your patients and
the family, so I really applaud you for that. During that time, because I know it was very
traumatic, what did you do to help preserve you? What did you do for your self-care?
GL 48:47
Oh, well, first of all, I had to isolate myself ‘cause I'm family-oriented, so even though I'm
far, everybody was like, “Hey!” you know, “Let's go to--". They call me Vona, so they like,
“Let's go to Vona’s house ‘cause it's like a mini vacation since we can’t go anywhere.” I
isolated myself and my family. I had to preserve them because I'm, like, even though I was
testing, like, three days a week, you know, I tested negative, I still was literally just in the
trenches with COVID. Like, every day, I had six patients and all of them COVID, different
levels of it, so I had to isolate myself from them, you know. I did a lot of resting, R & R for
myself, but then I still had those outlets, you know, from my family that, you know, when I
was just, like, losing it, you know, I was able to call them, you know, and, you know, or
somebody will just come up and meet me somewhere or whatever so that I just had that
outlet, you know, with family and friends and they were checking on me and making sure I
was okay. So, I did have a good circle of family and friends and, you know, the chapter of my
sorority. They were calling because they knew I was working in the trenches, so they were
calling and checking on me, like, randomly, you know, checking on me. So, I was able to
vent, and that was good because I was able to vent to nurses that, you know, they probably
afc2021009_007
weren't in the trenches but they were nurses, so I was able to, you know, vent with a better
understanding, you know, versus talking to my cousins or my friends or my boyfriend and
they like, “I got you,” [laughs] and you like, “No you don’t. You don’t understand,” you
know. So, it’s that union with the sorority, with my family, with them as well as with my
close friends and family it’s, you know, that's what held me together throughout everything.
CH
And what sorority is that?
GL
Chi Eta Phi.
CH
Sorority Incorporated! And since we are there, that's a good segue. How long have you been
a member of Chi Eta Phi?
GL
Since 2017. Like, a year before I graduated.
CH
Okay.
GL
Yeah, right before I graduated.
CH
Were you a Beta?
GL
No, I was actually going through--
CH
Do you mean the year before your baccalaureate?
GL
Yes.
CH
Okay. So, you were already a nurse?
GL
Yeah, I was a nurse, and so I was just going through the processing of getting it, ‘cause I
think it was, like, right at the time that I got my associate's degree and then I started going
through the process with my line sister so that we can-- I was going through the bachelor's
program, ‘cause my programs ran together. So, I did three consecutive years and did it
year-round. So, I did the bachelor's, which was Spring and Fall. In summers we were off, but
in the summertime I was at Cal State L.A. working on my bachelor's. So, yeah, it was, like, I
was year-round for the three years, so it was, like, within that window between the associate’s
and bachelor’s that I got inducted into Chi Eta Phi.
afc2021009_007
CH
What chapter and region are you in?
GL
The chapter is in Long Beach.
CH
Chi Eta Phi. What's the name of the chapter?
GL
It is Psi Eta [laughs] in Long Beach.
CH
Okay.
GL
Long Beach, California.
CH
What region is that?
GL
The west. Southwest.
CH
Okay.
GL
Yeah.
CH
Have you held any offices?
GL
No, not yet because I haven't had a chance to do that yet, that's why [inaudible 53:03] still
saying I'm the baby because they've been, you know, guiding me through everything but, like,
then we had COVID, ‘cause I started lining up to different structures and parts but I had to
pull back because of my move and transition coming up to the high desert. So, now I'm
getting back into the active part of being with the sorority. So, this actually is the first thing
that I've signed myself up for in a long time.
CH
Okay. You mean doing this interview?
GL
Yes, doing this interview.
CH
Well, we certainly appreciate it. Have you had the opportunity to participate in any of the
service for humanity projects?
afc2021009_007
GL
I did a couple of services with my line sister, educating at daycares for children with hand
hygiene. That was one of our projects that we did, hand hygiene project for young children.
Then, we did a 5k fundraiser. But, as far as with my chapter itself, I've signed up for stuff but
I wasn't able to, like, I had to pull back because I had some personal stuff that were going on
that was, like, really, yeah, so I had to pull out of the different things that I had going on at
that time.
CH
What does service for humanity mean for you, which is the model of the sorority?
GL
Service for humanity, for me, is helping everybody with no-- To give. I would say to give
myself without question of what it is, you know, and the same way where I am with nursing,
you know, so it all lines up together. It's, like, giving myself without thinking of what the cost
would be, you know, and it's just more catering to the needs of the people and whatever it is
that they need, you know, and not thinking about it. I would say, more of, like, not thinking
about it as a game for yourself, you know. It’s something that you should be able to give
without thought, and that's how I look at service for humanity. It’s giving without thought of
what will be given back to you because you're gonna get full, you know. You're getting full.
To me, I get full from giving to other people, you know what I'm saying. So, that's what it
means for me for service for humanity.
CH
Service for humanity means being selfless.
GL
Selfless, yes. I couldn't get the word, but yes.
CH
Now, I know you have recently changed jobs, I think you were telling me.
GL
Yes.
CH
What is your current position?
GL 56:21
So, I'm still doing RN in the telemetry department but I'm doing traveling. I'm traveling to
different areas, which has been interesting [laughs].
CH
How long have you been doing it?
GL
It's been a week now.
CH
Okay, so this is new, new, new to you.
afc2021009_007
GL
New, new [laughs].
CH
You are traveling locally?
GL
Yes, locally, meaning that when you travel-- I guess travel nursing, what was explained to me
is if it's over 50 miles. ‘Cause I thought everything was, like, if I'm still in California, it's
local, but no. They said if it's under 50 miles, then that's considered a local travel position.
Anything over that, then it’s travel. They just consider it as traveler.
CH
You get a different package, a different compensation for over 50 miles?
GL
Yeah. With the package, over 50 miles, you get a extra additional stipend, you know, for
housing and travel, food and all that other stuff. When you're local travel, you just get
whatever you negotiate with the contract for the site that you're gonna be going to.
CH
With your travel position now, do you want to travel outside of California are you just--
GL
Yeah, eventually, eventually. This is my first, I mean, I still feel like I'm a new nurse so, you
know, I jumped out on faith to, you know, explore, to see other hospitals and see other
cultures, you know. That's what I call it – the cultures within the different environments, in
the hospitals and stuff like that. See what I like, what I don't like, because I like to change. I
get bored easy, so I like to keep everything fresh. So, this is something that will help me do
that. But, I did start with the local travel because it’s new to me, and so since something came
up in my area, I was like, “I'll take that,” you know, and which has been working out because
I still have other things that gives me a chance to really, like, get things in order before I
started traveling because, like, one of the places when I first considered it was when I went to
Dubai. I was like, “This would be interesting to come to Dubai and travel,” ‘cause one thing I
learned is, like, when you do travel, the travel companies, they usually help you get your
certifications. If you're traveling out of the country, they help you with visas and all that other
stuff. They usually pay for it or pay a portion or give you a stipend towards that stuff, so it
makes it easier for you to want to travel, you know. If you don't have those obligations that's
keeping you home, you can travel and do different, you know, areas or different states,
different countries and stuff like that. So, I'm interested in trying to see how this is gonna
work out.
CH
So, you want to do international travel as well?
GL
Yeah, I wouldn't mind.
CH
So, you're not married, no children?
afc2021009_007
GL
Well, I have one daughter ‘cause I was a teen mom. So, my daughter is 32 and I have two
grandkids, but they stay in Texas.
CH
Okay.
GL
Yeah, so they stay in Texas, so I’m at home by myself. I have a boyfriend but, you know, we
don't stay together, and I have two cats [laughs].
CH
Okay, so you're pretty much free to go.
GL
Yeah, I’m free to go.
CH
That's really important. What advice would you have for someone who's thinking about
becoming a nurse?
GL
Okay. If you are thinking about becoming a nurse, make sure that you have a heart, a giving
heart, because nursing is not easy. You know, a lot of people go into nursing and they go into
nursing because of the money and-- Literally I'm telling you, it’s no amount of money
[laughs] in the world that is going to be worth it, okay? Do not go into nursing unless you
have a passion for this field.
CH
You say, “Warning! Warning! Do not--"
GL
Do not. Do not. Do not. This is real life. This is real life. It seemed fun and dandy doing all
that, but I'm telling you, if you do not have a passion for this, do not waste your time because
you're gonna have a hard time. It's gonna be rough for you as well as your career because
you're not gonna be in it for the right reasons so you're going to suffer, your career will suffer
and your patients will suffer. So, literally, because there’s gonna be days that you're gonna
question yourself. Like, literally, and I will tell you that when I first started, like, you know,
there was a time when I was at the senior facility and I was like, “Oh my God!” Like, you
know, when they weren't training me properly, but I was like, “I got this”. But, when I got
over to the hospital, it was hard work. It's hard work going into it, you know. You gotta be
built for it. It was hard when I first started and I was literally, like, my first week, you know,
and this is with a preceptor, and I was like, “You guys been doing this how long?” [both
laugh]. It was, like, in that moment, like, I literally had-- and I have a passion for it, but in
that moment, I myself still had to go home and really assess, “Is this really what I want to do?
Like, did I really pick the right career? Am I really built for this?” you know. “Do I really
have this compassion that I say that I have and I can really, you know, take care of a patient
and take care of another human being?” Like, I really had to go home and question myself
and make sure that I was making the right decision. Like, and it's something that's serious
‘cause you're dealing with life. This is not something that you can just be like, “Oh, I'm
afc2021009_007
gonna go and, you know, make some money real quick.” No. Some days you’ll have that,
“I'm gonna make some money real quick,” but a lot of your days is actually you're saving a
life. You're saving a life, and you need to understand that when you decide to make the
decision to say, “I'm going to nursing school,” you know. Nursing school is fun. It is hard, but
it is fun. When you get out of school, nursing is real life. They don't teach you that in
NCLEX. They don't teach you that when you're doing ATI. They don't teach you that when
you go take the T’s test. They don't teach you any of these things. It’s real life. That's all I
have to say. Please take it serious – your own life as well as the life you're gonna be taking
care of.
CH
Good words of wisdom. Finally, what are your thoughts about Chi Eta Phi Sorority
Incorporated?
GL
I think that that was the best thing that ever happened to me because, like, literally, I was lost
as a nurse, new nurse and, you know, finding my way and, like, ‘cause I'm the first nurse
from my parents, first healthcare provider from my parents, first RN in my family, and so I
didn’t have any, like, support, you know what I'm saying, while I was going through the
program and just, you know, that somebody I could relate with, the networking and, you
know, just that team of people that would actually be there like a sisterhood, you know. I
didn't have that before. You know, I have friends, family, but I just didn't have that sisterhood
that I have with the sorority that I have now.
CH
Okay, so the sisterhood, brotherhood with Chi Eta Phi Sorority Incorporated is very strong?
GL
Yes. Yes it is.
CH
And meaningful.
GL
It is meaningful.
CH
That's what you're saying?
GL
Mmhmm.
CH
Well, you say your family calls you Vona?
GL
Yeah, Vona.
afc2021009_007
CH
Okay, so, Soror Vona, I wish you well in your studies with the nurse practitioner course that
you are doing and keep going. Nursing is very rewarding.
GL
It is.
CH
You'll get to 100 years with the blink of a eye being a nurse.
GL
Oh my God.
CH
Yeah, and I thank you once again so much for taking part in this very important project.
GL
I really appreciate you offering it for me to come down.
CH
Okay. Thank you so much again.
