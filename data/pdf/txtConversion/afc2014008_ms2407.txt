icarest Snirley, Pat, Lob and Lisa:
 
Cnc,
.., t
n
ore deer frienos to tho breach in our
 
communication. We have received the beautiful plaques(last Saturday) and I wrote
 
inmediately to tell you of our joy in receiving them and to ask whether they are
 
ours or to be re-shipped. Sunsan got the rug, and another package for her arrived
 
today; during her a.sence  we are holding it here until she returns from Boston.
 
hoe did get to go,  she did get the money for travel from the state, and left last
 
hunday, returning tomorrow, March 15. She had a slight case of the virus tha t is
 
raging here in epidemic proportions, but felt that she was well enough to make the
 
trip. I have been encouraging her to stick out this job if she possibly can for at
 
least one year so that she can get a paid vacation, and then to try elsewhere. Her
 
situation with Mrs. Shelton seems to be like that of everyone else who comes in
 
contact with her so far as I can discern from very discreet inquiries, and I an
 
wondering if continued exposure to this kind of supervision is not more harmful
 
than helpful.  I have already written all this once, but John says he does not
 
roaeo er ever ua i
lird tLC  letter,  so it may never have reached you.

he reports that Anne is doing very well ,
 that she now has moved into New York into
 
her own apartment, that she is studying for college boards and plans to enter
 
college in February of next year. He says that within a few days he will receive
 
the computer results which he has been waiting for these many years, and the results
 
of the computation may-raise the academic aprreciation of car
itometrica enorm ously.
 
haysxsk
 he probably will become one of the three or four famous men in the  worlds.'0
 
also says he may be invited to address the American Academy of Science which is the
 
ultra branch 6f all universities, foundations, etc. in the higher echelon of
 
science. —which would indeed be a great leap forward in getting cantometrics
 
recognized as a new area of scientific exploration. Sounded very tired, but says
 
the strain of waiting for the data to  e processed is wearing on him. He has  moved
 
Irom the large  ppartment to a smaller one on the same area, and is urging all to
 
v
isit him. I -,

back to you, dear 1h1r1ey-burly. Eefora y u
 
nake u
s yur long range plans for te next few years I suggest that you (1) Talk to
 
L.  Boykin when you meet her, about possibilities in area other than Lubbock, and  2
 
investigate all possibilites of Europeans j
obs opportunities for American ladies of
 
your vast experience and superior talents among the places you travel ,
 inquire of
 
n
erican Express offices, consulates, embassies,  etc. anywhere English is sp oken.
 
Unless you have very definite i
deas that you decidedly want to come back to Tech
 
by next fall, you simply do not have enough information at present to base any
 
kind of decision,  it seems to me. It's all too iffy right at this point it seems to
 
me. Do you want to remain in Europe another year or notl Do you really want to
 
return to Tech? Would you be interested in another college ,
 with j
ob in housing
 
only and no disci
ine involved'!
 I ho e you will not rule out completely th a i
dea
 
that someday you might,  just might, meet somebody you'd be willing to marry, but
 
you understand I

hen we left Lubbock,  I was firmly resolved to write at least twice a
 
r
oontli to the entire family,  but my old slothful habits fell back on my shoul
 
like a mantle as soon as we hit Houston again. Howsomever, the biggest event Ci
 
local importance was the arrival of a snow
 the first in ten yea rs in Hous
ton  
and thoughtfully provided by a beneficient providence on Friday afternoon. Scho.lc
.
 
held the line in town,  but all the suburban schools let the children out early,
 
offices closed,  store people went r
iome and the whole town had an air of carniv l
 
festivity. We frolicked in the snow and ice untilafter 1
, realizing that by nocn
 
the snow man would be melted and the beautiful blanket of snow in our yard wcu d
 
e a s otty mud bog. You dweiiers in snowy climes cannot realize,  I know, the
 
effect snow has in a tropical climate
 most children under lb did not remember
 
ever f
laying seen a snow before,  certainly not one which stayed on the ground over-
night. Social affairs were cancelled while adults and child -en, university studer
 
and faculties frolicked together. It was like a sudden bonanza had ta±ler

s about Johnny  econdus(or perhaps i
ertius is more accurate / is that
 
all on the same day ne made a  9 on a 5-weeks Latin test, got initiated for-
mally into a high school club he wanted to join, and was one of two sophor:orec
 
p
icked for the L a ma r  HigL1 School baseball team. nis cup truly runneth over.
 
ihe club deal I'm not in lavor of in high school, but wnen I opposed it mi&dly,

deas too lar.
 
I demrvv
 but finally gave permission after considerable pressure.......all
 
went well until the iirst tap br dues came. lO a year
 and only three mouths
 
left of the year. .
...I let Johnny and his lather hash that one out
 then,
 
I'll also let them discuss the matter of a formal dance in the spring when tie
 
idea trickles in that nocody, not even a Lomax male ,  can get by with attendin
 
a iormal dance at the River Oaks Country Club in jeans and thrift shop jacket
 
This particular club is made up or boys who are required to have high grade
 
average, for membership, many of them are interested in astronomy, and the an
 
who have come here to pick him up ror chores during the week of apprentices J
 
as a "mullets were well mannered and fairly considerate or their f

or 10 days the initiates wore large blue R's on their clothes and were suojact
 
to orders rrom the elder statesmen of the Ramal Club(Lamar spelled backwards....
 
that seems to give you a clue as to the serious purpose of this august body).
 
Funniest stunt: Begging eg s rrom door to door,  selling them back on the next
 
block to earn money for t
rie senior members to go bowling. Hair-cut now resau lus
 
a monk s tonsure,  plus a scraggly beginning of a beard. Other initiates are
 
called

"Listen ', he said", Liddy is so busy  ry huj to s

Only one that can tie that is a nei jibcr across tue street wuo 15  remodel-

her nouse explained to me that she is f
laying the old-fashioned windows removed
 
and will soon replace them with  Ja-L USies". I thought I hadn '

642e Vander

Dearest Lo n
ax-Exes, I
lawses, l
4ansells, and Gordonas
 
Greetings all, and this omnibus report of the festivities at Welltleet
 
which we all wished for you all. Alan and Toni , in time, can g
ive you a
. report from their
 
point of view, but this is how it all began for us.
 
From Washington, we made several attempts to reach Alan, with no
 
answer to the telephone *  So, on Saturday, August  19,  after an intensive three days of
 
sight-seeing and touristing to all the familiar spots, we ran to catch a train from
 
W
as • to P
liiedelphia for anouther round there, with dinner at Bookbinder '
s(yearued for
 
Susan at that lovely place wherz l
obsters swi
ing in melted butter were abounding).
e
 
again, we tried to reach Alan by phone...no an wer,so on we went to New York, deciding
 
that it was  just our unhappy luck to arrive there after he had decamped for the summer*
 
S
ince you are all familiar with the Lo
x no tipping policy, you will know that we were
 
always heavily laden with luggage on this j
ourney, the only omission from this trip was
 
the Australian camouflage bag which customarily accompanies us on vacation trips. While
 
the family rallied around a pile of luggage, I ran to make one last call to Alan before
 
we loaded into a taxi and beaded for the Taft Hotel where we had reservations. Anne answered,
 
and immediat.lj urged us to come on to the apartment on West third, saying she had gotten
 
ready for us, hoped we were coming, and almost given up hope. Alan had called from s
o m
e
 
place upstate that be would be in later that evening, and both of them were expecting the
 
entire family to stay with th e
m. S
o, in we piled to the first upcoming taxi, who turned
 
into 6th avenue and circled the Waverly Theater s
o many times Johnny claimed they changed
 
the bill while we were looking for Alan's address. Finally, t
ie driver gave up, admitted
 
that be had just driven in with a fare from Long Isla n
d, didn't know the Village r 
and suggested that we get out and walk. •
 .
'
we accepted the challenge s and staggered half
 
a block up the street , then up the stairs to
 apartment were we were j
oyously met
 
by Anne and her harlequin poodle, Blueberry .
 
After the cultural tour of e
ducational buidings and national
 
shrines we had mapped out for Washington and Philadelphia, the boys were ready for a
 
change of pace. Anne bad thoughtfully provided food for all, and after a few minor skir-
mished over who would and who wou1dn t take a bath  we set out for Times Sqvi
ars via
 
eibway on Saturday night. We walked up and down, gawking with the rest of the crowd at
 
all the  lights, animated signs, and I bad a gay time re-living my years in New Tork, eoa
 
paring now and then(sinoe 1940 when I lived there, and our let visit, when Bess and Butch
 
'
ware married). We also oa melled our res e
rvation at the Taft where I had a
. hilarious ax-
perienee with a would-be I
,otbario who thought I was lonely in the big city
. because it
 was
 
seated on a comob waiting for various members of the party to re-assemble and who faded
 
away in a h
urry when John, Johnny, Joey and Anne j
oined ma • Back to the pe
.rtment by aid
 
ni g
ht, we found only Blueberry waiting to greet us, so the male members of the party
 
decamped into the first of Alan's two big rooms, leaving the second room for Anne , Blue
 
and as to share the bed • The apar nent is located over a restaurant which features folk
 
singers and modern jazz on Saturday and Sunday nights. I have no idea who they were, but
 
can testify they attacked their entertainment assignments with vigor • Anne and I talked and
 
1iod Like boarding school fre&  -
nt until about 2 AM when tiere we a temporary lull.

Next day, we spent helping Anne and Alan p.0k up and 4.prt for
 
o1lfleet ,  finally g
ot them loaded about 3z
0 , then began a brief sight-seeing trip to
 
the Museum of Modern Art, the Gug enheini, and then to celebrate John's birthday with
 
dinner at a p
osh restaurant • The boys were not emitted witout coats, but the .
rri gement

toreaeeinj, the hicks-from--the sticks s
eason was at band had laid in a supply of j
ackets
 
for just such emergencies • They were of grey cotton, similar to those worn by barbers,
 
and a funnier looking trio you'll never so.. Joey a was much too lerg, Johnny's was too
 
short in the the ar m
s  an

With connivance to the bead waiter who seemed to enjoy the
 
contretemps as much as the othar guest., Johnny was surprised with a birthday c

On W

a s
ack lunch i*do up from a

ort u

however, we were forced to wake one stop in Connecticut, s
o we supplemented our rations for
 
the road as soon as B
ig John disappeared into the g
eutalman s room.

ay that A

profile o
f erossaulture patterns, ancient and modern which he b
elieves will open up an
 
entirel ew field in anthropology , perhaps also have a bearing on waking 'votee prints of
 
indivit
hels, much as they are now fingerprinted, and has exciting p
ossibilities in many
 
f
ields of sociology and cultural research. )
 
On Thursday morning, we began the preparations for the wedding by consulting in
 
ri s
Food, retrmsharaeut., rings 1 decorations, tableware 1 silver, etc* when we learned that
 
neither Al.?t, nor T

oixg those who had responded to the airm from the front) kily Post doesn't
 
seem to cover such social emergencies as this, so we all just grabbOd Toni and hugged her,
 
introducing On.elves as we went • Her mother, father, and 13-year old brother had accompanied
 
er in their family station wagon, laden with food, flowers, c
lothes, luggage, and after
 
the friat greetings were over, I hustled Mr. Marchand out the baàk door to help change over
 
the gas cylinder, got Joey and Paul, Jr. acquainted; Johnny with his delightful savoir faire
 
took over Mrs • )&rohand to chat, Toni and Anne discussed plans for the next day, Victor
 
wandered in and out looking hungry and helpful. W
e passed the firit hurdle with hilarity
 
when Mrs. Marchand said, 'Why are you so dressed up? •. They had arrived in shorts and
 
sneakers, and with I'= sure many misgivings about Toni '
a narriage to Alan. The ice was
 
not only broken, it was  oor
nepletely melted and we were all getting along swimmingly. They
 
had brought beautiful white gladiolas and pale pink ones, two big buckets full, and we bgan
 
to plan again about the wedding. Although we offered thor
n food and drink as instructed by
 
Alan, they had eaten along the highway, but j
oined  us in a cup of coffee. After about an
 
hour and a }*li Alan and John came back, theyn the joyous re-unions and the introductions
 
began again.
 
I took to Toni immediately because she is warm and loving, appreelative, gay, sm
art,
 
energetic, and perceptive, In coloring, she reminds me of Pat, b
lack hair, pulled back
 
and caught at the nape of her neck like Pat wears
 her, lovely ey a, freckles, about  '
 
height, maybe not quite so tall, a luscious figure, laughing ejea, a lovely voice and
 
just the right note with every member of the ploygot crew ass nblèd • LIen beamed on
 
her, and immediately took her off , leaving us to get acquainted with her family. They
 
really are quite a smart bunch of cookies. Mr. Marchand is French , descended from a
.
 
Paris family which for several generations has specialised in the wmatlug technique of
 
building displays for natural history and science mae u
sa. H. his be n on sta f
f of Buffalo
 
Museum, but is now free-lancing and has been called on to do displays for museums in Denver,
 
Cincinnati, Fort Worth...all over the coun ry. Be is a love, easy going and fun • M
rs. Marchand
 
is a beautiful woman with brown eyes, nice figure, gorgeous white hair, and an ardent Girl
 
Scout hider , just returned from a week's tour with a troop which stayed one week on a
 
boat at )
4ystic, Oonne for sea-training with her girls • She was s little reserved at first,
 
but by the time we had gone through a few hours together, we were *okcing in a te a

ling buddies • Paul, Jr. Is a self reliant, smart, quiet tall' boy and he and Joe y
 
hit if off beautifully. Be and Joey and Ann had a hilarious game g,1 g of hiding ransom
 
notes behind the garage. W
ell, to telescope the next few hours, ve a f
l had such a good time
 
together, nobody wanted to leave to spend the night elsewhere, so '
all i

down by midnight. Mr • Marchand in the station wagon, Paul, Jr. on an atr mattress , Mrs.
 
Marchand on a folding cot • That smart gal had even brought sheets and beddingi
 
Saturday , after all eleven had been fed, Mrs Marchand and '
I decided on a
. course
 
of action. We cleared out all the furniture in the living room, c
overed a heater with a
 
white pla tic tablecloth for an altar, covered the fire place With pine bou g
hs, and the
 
younger set went to work he'  i
ng white wedding bells, streamers, etc. Then, she and her
 
crew went to Orleans to pic
 t
p food and got flowers fo
the bridé, Tón  and Alan departed
 
to receive a lecture on 0hristian marriage from the Qongregational minister, Johnny went to
 
beach to renew acquaintance with a pretty girl from White P
lains vacationing there, and I
 
l
it in to cook ham, peel sweat potatoes, etc •  For reasons unbeknownst to me, Alan insisted
 
on having sweet potatoes as the accompaniment to turkey and ham, but I drew the line at
 
baked sweet potatoes for 2S  !de two big casseroles with pineapple and lots of seasonings.
 
Mrs •
 Marchand , meanwhile, had most of the craw informed that no lunch would be served,
 
and she and Ana did t.e last minute shopping chores.
 
W

Devotedly yours,
 
September 10, 1961
 
6428 Vanderbilt, Houston
 
Dearest Lomax-Exos, Hawses, ).nsells, and Gordonas
 
Greetings all, and this omnibus report of the festivities at W
elifleet
 
which we all wished for you all. Alan and Toni ,  in time, can give you a report from their
 
point of view, but this is how it all began for us.
 
From W
ashington, we made several attempts to reach Alan, with no
 
answer to te telephone. So, on Saturday, August  19, after an intensive three days of
 
sight-seeing and t
.uristing to all the familiar spots, we ran to catch a train from
 
W
as. to Phisdeiphia for anouthor round there, with dinner at Boolcbinder's(yearned for
 
Susan at that lovely place where lobsters swimming in melted butter were abound t
hg).
e
 
again, we tried to reach Alan by phone...no answer,so on we went to New York, deciding
 
that it was just our unhappy luck to arrive there after he had decamped for the summer.
 
S
ince you are all familiar with the Lomax no tipping policy, you will know that we were
 
al ways heavily laden with luggage on this j
ourney, the only omission from this trip was
 
the Australian camouflage bag which customarily accompanies us on vacation trips. While
 
the fam 1y rallied around a pile of luggage, I ran to make one last call to Alan before
 
we loaded into a taxi and headed for the Taft Hotel where we had rese vations. Anne answered,
 
and immediatelj urged us to come on to the apartment on West third, s
aying she had gotten
 
ready for us, hoped we were coming, and almost given up hope. Alan had called from s
ome
 
place upstate that he would be in later that evening, and both of them were expecting the
 
entire family to stay with thea. So, in we piled to the first upcoming taxi ,  who turned
 
into 6th avenue and circled the Waverly Theater s
o many times Johnny claimed they changed
 
the bill while we were 1o king for Alan's address. Finally, t e driver gave t
ip, admitted
 
that he had just driven in with a fare from L
ong Island, didn't know the Village,
 
and sugfested that we get out and walk. •
 .
we accepted the challenge, and sta
ered half
 
a block up the street ,  then up the stairs to Alan's apartment were we were j
oyously met
 
by Anne and her harlequin poodle, Blueberry .
 
After the cultural tour of e
ducational buidinge and national
 
shrines we had mapned out for W
ashington and Philadelphia, the boys were ready for a
 
change of pace. Anne had thoughtfully provided food for all, and after a few minor skir-
mishes over who would and who
 take a bath, we set out for Times Square via
 
subway on S
aturday night. W
e walked up and down, gawking with the rest of the crowd at
 
all the lights, animated signs, and I bad a gay time re-living my years in New York, coin
 
paring now and then(since 1940 when I l
ived there, and our let visit, when Bess and Butch
 
were married). We also cancelled our reservation at the Taft where I had a hilarious ex-
perience with a would-be Lothario who thought I was lonely in the big city because I was
 
seated on a couch waiting for various members of the party to re-assemble and who faded
 
away in a hurry when John, Johnny ,  Joey and Anne j
oined me. Sack to the partment by mid
 
night, we found only Blueberry waiting to greet us, so the male members of the party
 
decamped into the first of Alan's two big rooms, leaving the second room for Anne ,  B
lue
 
and r
oe to share the bed. The aparbinent is located over a restaurant which features folk
 
s
ingers and modern jazz on Saturday and Sunday nights. I have no idea who they were, but
 
can testify they attacked their entertainment assi g
nments with vigor. Anne and I talked and
 
giggled like boarding school freshmerit until about 2 AM when tere was a temporary lull.
 
The echo of steps on the first •loor hei*lded Alan's return to t
he fold, woke Blue who
 
began to bark, and in be came, announcing almost simultaneously th&tLe He had rented a
 
four-bedrc0rn house in Welifloet ov r the phone, (
2. He had proposed to Toni March
"
 
who had accepted him( . He was leaving t e next day for W
elifleet and 4. W
e must come to
 
W
ellfleet to the wedding which was scheduled for Saturday, Augut 26.
 
Next day, we spent helping Anne and Alan pack up and deprt for
 
ellfleet ,  finally g
ot them loaded about 3s 0, then began a brief sight-seeing trip to
 
the Museum of Modern Art, the Oug enheim, and then to celebrate John's birthday with
 
dinner at a posh restaurant. The boys were not admitted witout coats, but the management
 
2.
 
foreseeing the hicks-from-the sticks season was at hand had l
aid in a supply of j
ackets
 
for just such emergencies. They were of grey cotton, similar to those worn by barbers,
 
and a funnier l
ooking trio you'll never see. Joey 's w
as much too larg, Johnny's was too
 
short in the the ar ms and J
ohn '
a didn S
t fit him anywhere. When they tiled out of the cloak
 
room to r
ejoin me in the dining r
oom, I laughed s
o hard that e
ven imperturbably lnpty was
 
a l
ittle embaraseed, particularly s
ince I had urged all o
f them to take j
ackets before we
 
l
oft the house, reminding them that j
eans and rolled s
leeves were not c
o me i
i taut on
 
upper P
erk and Lexington. ... .ith c
onnivance to the bead waiter who seemed to enjoy the
 
contretemps as much as the other guests,  Johnny was surprised with a birthday c
andle served
 
i
n a l
arge s
lice of cake p
laced before him with & waiter who served it with flourishes
 
usua l
ly reserved for crepes sug.tte • Than, on to Central P
ark for a walk to the Hayden
 
P
lanetarium and a thrilling l
ecture-demonstration on 'Man i

On Thursday morning, we began the preparations for the wedding by consulting in
 
rs i
Food, refreshementa, rings, decorations, tableware, silver, etc. when we learned that
 
neither A
lan, nor T
oni, wanted to b
e married in the registry. There was s
ome uncertainty
 
as to who w
ould c
ome tith Toni from Buffalo, who would be invited from A
lan's friends,
 
and I confess, at that p
oint, how we c
ould mamage the wedding feast of turkey, ham, sweet
 
potatoes, s
alad, wedding cake, p
unch, champagne, salad , etc • in a beach c
ottage, about
 
ìô miles from a town of any s
ize, no telephone and a very o
dd tlêor p
lan . This four bedroom
 
house had four tiny b
edrooms upstairs, all opening onto a minute ball into which tie s
tairs
 
opened • The walls were far from s
oundproof, s
o that every trip to the bathro cm d
ownstairs
 
and across the and of the l
iving room was a s
ound-track production audible to all. T
he b athroom
 
door had a double l
ock, very peculiar, installed backwards s
o that each time it was p
llied,
 
the v
isitor inside the roomy b
ath had a feeling it might be his last s
ight of civilizatin
 
until extricated by a f
ireman's ax.. I
t always did worki with much c
licking and c
lacking
 
auddently you were c
atapulted back to your l
oved ones # at l
east one of whom demanded to
 
know what you c
ould have been doing in there all that time. M
ost knew.
 
A
lan and Anne were anxi
ous that the wedding be gay, and Alan was especially emphatic
 
that there be PLENTY of food and drink. I finally convinced them that it would be wiser t
o
 
depend on outside s
ources for food i
tems too long-cooking for me to at empt in the small
 
gas o
ven of the c
ottage, unless all the present inmates would be willing to l
ive on s
a n
d
 
w
ichos for three days • 3
o, off Anne and I went to grocery shop, making arrangements too,
 
for a weading oaks to be p
icked up on S
aturday at noon, and while we were at it, we got
 
a turkey r
oasted, rented punch bowl, cups, silver coffee urn, cups , saucers, and began
 
p
lanning. Anne was absolutely e
cstatic over the preparations, proved to be a good shopper,
 
and an excellent p
la n
ner and helper. By t
iis time, something had gone wrong with A
lan's
 
oar(the Buick Susan remembers), and e
verytime anybody wanted to go anywhere not accessible
 
by footpaths, the red R
ambler was pressed into s
ervice. In view of the fact that we had
 
rented the car on a milage basis in New Tor., each trip out was l
ooked at with askance by
 
the g
entleman who had s
igned the contract, and all o
:poditione ware j
udiciously routed to

G
ame Friday, and we still d
idn't know how many were coming, who they would be,

J.
 
Alan rushing us back to the cottage  with the announcement that we must all have on shoes,
 
all have on shirts, all have our hair combed and g nerallyX be on our best behavior. W
ith
 
that, he and John got in the car and disappeared for a quick swim. I was hurrying supper
 
so that we could all fulfill the requirements and present a charming picture of genteel ,
 
ray
'feened faintly in waiting to welcome the bride, when suddenly I noticed that the supper
 
wa*n't cooking at the rate it had previously....a quick check revealed .
..no gas at the
 
burner tip. So, out I dashed to the shed where cylinders were stored, tried to guess which
 
was full and which empty, and had just begun to read instructions, when a piercing shriek
 
from Anne a
rnounced "Here they come 1
 Here
 Toni '. Sure, enough there was a large s
tation
 
wagon loaded to the hilt turning into our urive. Away we went to greet her, a cavalcade
 
from the rear j
oing those who had responded to tho airm frc  the front) Emily Post doesn't
 
seem to cover such social emergencies as this, so we all just grabbed Toni and hugged her,
 
introducing ourselves as we went • Her mother, father, and 1-year old brother had accompanied
 
her in their family station wagon, laden with food, flowers, c
lothes, luggage, and after
 
the frist greetings were over, I hustled Mro Marchand out the back door to help change over
 
the gas cylinder, got Joey and Paul, J
r. acquainted; Johnny with his deli:htful savoir faire
 
tok over Mrs. )rchand to chat, Toni and t
hne discussed plans for the next day, Victor
 
wandered in and out looking hungry and helpful. W
e passed the first hurdle with hilarity
 
when Mrs • Marchand said,
 t
hy are you so dressed up!
 . They had arrived in shorts and
 
sneakers, and with
 sure many misgivings about Toni's marriage to Alan. The ice was
 
not only broken, it was comepletely melted and we were all getting along swimmingly. They
 
had brought beautiful white gladiolas and pale pink ones, two big buckets full, and we bgan
 
to plan again about the wedding. Although we offered them food and drink as instructed by
 
Alan, they had eaten along the highway, but j
oined  us in a cup of coffee. After about an
 
hour and a half Alan and John came back, theyn the j
oyous re-unions and the introductions
 
began again.
 
I tok to Toni immediately because she is warm and loving, appreciative, gay, smart,
 
energetic, and perceptive, In coloring, she reminds me of Pat, black hair, pulled back
 
and cau:ht at the nape of her neck like Pat wears her, lovely eyes, freckles, about rW 
height, maybe not quite so tall, a luscious figure, laughing eyes, a lovely voice and
 
just the right note with every member of the ploygot crew assecbled • Alan beamed on
 
her, and imme
diately took her off ,  leaving us to get acquainted with her family. They
 
really are quite a sm
art bunch of c
ookies. Mr. Marchand is French ,  descended from a
 
Paris family which for several generations has specialized in the exacting technique of
 
building displays for natural history and science museums. He has bo n on staff of Buffalo
 
Museum, but is now free-lancing and has been called on to do displays for museums in Denver,
 
C
incinnati, Fort Worth...all over the coun ry. He is a love, easy going and fun •  Mrs. Marchand
 
is a beautiful woman with brown eyes, nice figure, gorgeous white hair, and an ardent Girl
 
S
cout leader ,  just returned from a
. week's tour with a troop which stayed one week on a
 
b
oat at Mystic, Conn. for sea-training with her girls. She was a little reserved at first,
 
but by the time we had gone through a few hours together, we v
.
,ere wroking in a teem like
 
old buzk ling buddies •  Paul, Jr. is a self reliant, smart, quiet tall boy and he and Joe y
 
hit if off beautifully. He and Joey and Ann had a hilarious game going of hiding ransom
 
notes behind the garage. W
ell, to telescope the next few hours, we oil had such a g
ood time
 
together, nobody wanted to leave to spend the night e
lsewhere, so all e
leven is us got bedded
 
down by midnight. Mr. Marchand in the station wagon, Paul, Jr. on an air mattress ,  Mrs.
 
Marchand on a folding cot. That smart gal had even brought sheets and beddingl
 
Saturday , after all eleven had been fed, Mrs Marchand and I decided on a c
ourse
 
of action. W
e cleared out all the furniture in the living room, c
overed a heater with a
 
white pla tic tablecloth for an altar, covered the fire p
lace with pine boughs, and the
 
younger set went to work hanging white wedding bells, streamers, etc. Then, she and her
 
crew went to Orleans to pick up food and get flowers for the bride, Toni and Alan departed
 
to receive a lecture on Christian marriage from the Congregational minister, Johnny  ent to
 
beach to renew acquaintance with a pretty girl from White P
lains vacationing there, and I
 
lit in to cook ham, peel sweet potatoes, etc. For reasons unbeknownst to me, Alan insisted
 
on having sweet potatoes as the accompaniment to turkey and ham, but I drew the line at
 
baked sweat potatoes for 251  W e two big ca sseroles with pineapple and lots of seasonings.
 
Mrs. Marchand ,  meanwhile, had most of the crew informed that no lunch would be served,
 
and she and Ana did t.e last minute shopping chores.
 
W
e had many alarms and excursions over clothes. Alan decided his j
acket didnot
 
look right, so off he went to buy another .
... 
returned with a blue and tan striped blazer
 
/
 
whick looked like the kind of jacket a college glee club quartet would wear  
.
...waS
 
dissauded from wearing that....borrowed a j
acket from a friend, then found his one
 
white shirt was torn .
...
 off again. John borrowed a white shirt from Johnny, pressing
 
went on furiously and somehow by 5
:15 we were all bathed and dressed. Joey was the
 
real best-dressed man at the wedding' He had inherited a
. white jacket and dark trousers,
 
had brought his white shirt, cuff links, black tie, etc. Johnny l
ooked handsome in dark
 
suit. John was sli htly rumpled, but presentable in dark coat, grey pants. All the men
 
had white carnations, Ann wore the pretty rose and white dress he had in Houston, p
ink
 
roses. Tony was radiant in a dress of blue velvet top, stiff satin skirt, pink roses
 
for bouquet. I had my red silk dress along, but noting that Mrs. Marchand was wearing
 
a tan dressmaker suit, I s
witched to Pat i
s grey suit in which I felt elegant, indeed.
 
We jet tables on the porch for the wedding cake and coffee silver urn, at which young
 
Paul and Joey presided. Main table
 held the turkey, ham, salad, and hot rol ls, plus  the  
swe et potatoes casserole, and at the door was a large punch bowl of, guess whatt k
lan's
 
t it was deliciouS1 I held a firm
 
famouris punch. Susan, you will be amazed
 to  know
 tha  
 
hand on the making, ruled out bananas, grapes and various other o
Ldments Alan was going
 
to include. Made of vodka, grapefruit, and pineapple juice with floating oranges and
 
the addition of pineapple sherbet it was wonderful1 Joey refe red to it as diaper pail
 
punch in private conversations to me, (Susan swears that Alan made punch in a diaper
 
tub borrowed from a neighbor in his apartment on one of her New York visits).
 
Alan was a j
oy to behold, so delighted that all was going well, beaming on everybody,
 
rushing around giving us all directions, bubbling with exoitxnent and gaiety. A shout from
 
the front announced the arrival of the first guests, a
. Mr. and Mrs. Holts who had a beach
 
cottage somewhere in tne vicinity and who had known Alan in New York, punch was immediately
 
ladled; another crisis developed. Mrs. Marchand made the discovery we had music from all
 
countries of the world c
overing tribal ceremonies of every description on tapes stacked
 
to the ceiling, but NO WEDDING MUSIC. Victor came to the rescue, unearthed a record of
 
some Bach music from one of A
lan's friends, and we breathed another sign of relief. Next
 
came the Thayere, a delightful couple who had vacated their own cottage about five miles
 
distant to provide a honeymoon setting for Alan and Toni, then came J
.ea Falk and his 10-year
 
old son and a lush, plush blonde cute gal named Shirley Smith. The minister stood quietly
 
by until all had assembled, then the ceremony began. Anne c
ame first, then We Marchand
 
and Toni met Alan and John before the fireplace banked with pine, flowers and white
 
candles. It was a traditional ceremony with all the trimmings, wilt thous answered in
 
ringing tones by Alan, modest assents by Toni, solemn and really lovely; We reached the
 
final prayer without incident when suddenly there was a banging and awbanging at the
 
door....We had for
 
to tie up Blueberry1 Incensed because he was not  includ e
d in such
 
an  interesting fam 1y activity , he  finally got the screen open, banged the  door
 and  charged
 
in, sniffed at each and every guest, finally settled down on Anne foot. All this time the
 
family and guests stood with bowed heads, eyes cutting right and left as B
lueberry made
 
the rounds. The gentle English minister prOceeded t undistrubed, e
ven b
j the second banging
 
on the ecrren doo ...thi8 time a portly little man dressed in red flannel c
oat, white
 
knit T-skirt, sandals, ap earod on the porch. Johnny was nearest the door, started to
 
invite him out, thinking he was a beach combing character who had just drifted in to see
 
what the excitement was all about. Thought better of it and waited. The late guest proved
 
to be a special friend of Alan '
s...a Dr. Redo of Ne  York City who is alleged to be the
 
oustanding psychoanalyst in the U. S. At the conclusion, Victor turned up the Back, punch
 
circulated, and from somewhere, champagne was produced to toast the bride. It may be the
 
only wedding on record where guests crank a toast in peanut butter glasses and c
offee
 
cups, but all present entered into the happy spirit of the day to toast the bride and
 
groom in te minister's word "To yourenduring bap'inees 5 .
 Victor then again manned the
 
Italy, while Mrs.
 
tape recorder, this time playing gay music
 from
 
Marchand and I s
curri ed  
aroun , children helping to see that everybody was fed, pictures were taken, etc. We rolled
 
up the rug, and everybody danced with the bride, the friends the fam ly. Joey and I had a
 
fine time demonstrating what he'd learned at dance school this spring. It was really fun,
 
with everybody having a good time. Meanwhile, after completing ohir stint at the wedding
 
sake, (where they had  rawn a
. beared on the figure of the bridegroom atop the tiered c
ake)
 
the two little boys, plus the one who came as a guest, Johnny and Anne had decorated
 
Alan's oar with shaving s
oap. A
dded a few tine cans, streamers, etc., and all were equipped
 
with rice.

'
 
Food was still plentiful, the punch bowl was refilled, and the guests continued to
 
dance and rejoice generally. About an hour and a half afte  they had left for their
 
cabin hide-away, U
n
ipty game everybody a spoon and a pan, we loaded into oars and tracked
 
them to their lair. Parking care on bill, we alked barefiôt through the sand, and then
 
broke loose with the dad-guadeet racket you can imagine I
 M
ost of the guests and other
 
family were unfamiliar with the ahivaree custom, but delighted to take part in iti We stayed
 
just
 few minutes, just long enough to dieconce t Alan momentarily, then off we drove
 
back to the cottage. Anne, )
4r3. Marchand and I with the aid of the men and boys c
leared
 
up the place and finally fell into bed. I
t was a howling success from every point of view,
 
but mainly because every person present before during and after the ceremony was Be
 
adaptable, so helpftl and so full of good will toward all assembled that it was one of those
 
miraculous occasions where strangers meet under strained circumstances and each rises to
 
meet the demands of a special ch
allenge so admirably that the entire group becomes envel oped
 
in a glow of good will. It was an intangible thing, not related tb the refreshments which
 
really served merely as a gracious gesture of hospitality i a family milestone which was
 
marred by only one thing lacking  
the presence of all of you. How many times did I l
ong
 
for all of you, knowing that each of you would have enjoyed it w
.s much as we did, and
 
wishing we could share this happy time together as we have always shared the times of
 
trouble and sorrow.
 
Long though this letter i
s, I have mrerely scratched the surface, hampered
 
s
omewhat in the writing by the constant bulletins on Hurricane Carla which have been
 
coming in by TV and radio since Saturday
 we now have no electricity, but except for
 
a yard full of l
imbs, we have had no damage. We had candles handy, cooked everything in
 
the refrigerator, and have been in a state of watching and waiting for two days.
 
Deante , about the same, except that she is gradua  y losing weight. I got
 
through to he  about Alan's wedding in a lucid moment, and was g
ratified to hear her
 
say 'That's wonderful news. I wish I could have been therel' This is the most she has
 
s
aid in a long time. Usually just responds to questions. Some days are bad, some worse,
 
but we are fortunate in the wonderful colored girls we have been able to keep; so many
 
families in a similar situation have a constant turn-over of girls who simply cannot
 
stand the nerve strain of caring for a patient of this type. W are blessed, too, in
 
that although Deanie often screams, she is not aware she is screaming, ad although
 
she is  uneomfortable, I do not believe she is in any pain.
 
Please let us hear from all of you. W
e had a wonderful note from Hod with a
.
 
copy of a magazine telling us more about Houston's highways than I knew, letters
 
forwarded from Pat about Shirley's work-out, but we need to know Susan's school
 
address, news about Naomi, Nick, Ovey, Otter, Bess and Butch. Anne reported a mar-
vellous time in California and was so proud of her dress mace there she wore it to
 
Broadway at mi night. Showed us s
ome of Nick's cartoons which we enjoyed mightily,
 
and benefitted greatly by exposure to the Hawes wonderful hospitality, as do we all 1
 
W
e have invited her to spend a month with us next summer s and now I
!m  starting out
 
with the hope that we can work something out so that Naomi, Nick, Corey, Anne, Johnny
 
and Joey can spend some time together.
 
Haven't stopped to correct spelling, the radio warns of tor:ential rains,
 
s
o am rushing to send this lengthy bulletin before our streets are c
overed with water.
 
I have the honor to recommend Toni to each and every one of you. I am delighted
 
that she conaunited to j
oin this c
lan. A letter from her to all i
s an route, and if we
 
ever get pictures, you'll see what a prize Alan ha I

 G

 It i

me against supplying unwanted information in other people's problems*
 
Just about this timep Susan g it must be puzzling t

that although two p

Or,anizecI for t4, P ro r
notion of i iana1h
a
 1
/
 
this deeision be best for UST', instead of "
would I enjoy t
ii1 ".
 I had lived alone in
 
a pleasant apartment, spacious and exactly suited to my wishes.
 Suddenly, I found
 
myself in a small house, primarily designed as a business location, living 24 hours
 
a day in a barrierless proximity of marriage.
 Gone were the days when I could
 
read all night if I wanted to, or play records at 2 AM.
 I loved i
.pty, I wanted
 
to Wmarried, I wanted to help with the new business, but there were many times when
 
I yearned for privac , and the luxutW
 of being alone.
 
Aft r years of supporting myself and disposing of my hard-earned cash
 
as I saw fit, I found it galling to be financially dependent on somebody else and to
 
feel that I had to justify every expenditure as being one of benefit for both of us.
 
I had no charge account, no allowance, and since I had used practically all my
 
8avin s j, pay up a life insurance policy for my parents and to buy my trousseau, no
 
ready  as left.
 I wish somebody had told me then, that sound money management is the
 
basis of a successful partnership of any kind.
 
Then, there's the matter of the birds and the bees books.
 S
omehow,
 
they just are not specific enough to cover the adjustment necessary to become a boudoir
 
belle 4ernightt after years of being taught modesty a home and all the values of
 
virtue and chastity.
 There was a blithe and erroneous impression in my mind that willing-
ness of the mind was enough. .it isn't.
 For a woman, the ultimate invasion of pri-
vacy and person is a dismal failure unless it is based on a kind of spiritual unity
 
and superior companionship which takes time and tenderness to develop...and more pa-
tience than many men have as bridegrooms or at any time therafter.
 A healthy, hapiy
 
mutually satisfying physical relationship is a goal often reached only after many
 
disillusioning experiences and sometimes never, unless the participants are wise
 
enough to profit by shared errors.
 - 
Seventeen years ago, I wish somebody had told me that Umpty was get-
ting a wife who had no experience in actually running a household in the practical mat-
ters of cleaning, washing, ironing, b&ying food wisely, serving it promptly, cooking
 
it skillfully...and even sucha a mundane subject as sewing I needed to know...and didn't.
 
The first time I ironed a pair of work pants, I ironed them as I would a dress...in-
side our, leaving those carefully steamed creases INSIDE the pants legs.
 The bizarre
 
effect of these weird looking britches was enchantingly intei ified by the small lumps
 
of starch which decorated the lboriously ironed shirt, taste4'ully varied with brown scorch
 
smudges.
 There was the day I did my housewifely duty by polishing all leather shoes
 
snd hanging them on the line all-wool garments to sun to prevent moth  and mildew.
 
This admirable effort was canceled when I remembered to recover t
i from the yard only
 
£fter a hard rain had reduced them all to a soggy mess.
 For years, I
'd written reams
 
of radio and display advertising copy directed to homemakers, unct usly telling them
 
what to do.
 Any one of those poor, ignorant women whom I s
o snobbishly regarced
 
from my pinnacle of commercial success would have done better than that.
 
The Spanish are supposed to have what sounds like a silly xproverb:
 
"Here lies LOVE...not killed by one crushing blow, but stung to death by gnats"....
 
A habit of never finishing a song, or rolling eyes, of ciearing a throat, of cracking
 
a knuckle can become unbearable under days of disenchantment already stretching
 
and rasping on nerves rubbed raw by physical stress, emotional upheaval, and financial
 
stringencies.
 (
I got s
o mixed up in those metaphors I think I failed to express the
 
simple thought that anybody c
an get married, but staying married is the hardest
 
work I
've done...the most challenging, the most difficult, the the most rewarding.).
 
Looking back after 17 years, I wish tomebody had said to me:  "Be sure you're READY.
 
then when you feel you can really be a helpmate to the man you know you love without any
 
doubts or misgivings, go ahead."
 
Whatever you decide, now or later, Susan, we love you dearly.

Dearest A
lan, B
ess, and Shirley(pleaae note diplomatic alphabetical order):
 
Word from Alan and Bess almost simultaneously announcing a move into larger quar-
ters for both families  brings up the question of the Lomax furniture now inresidence
 
at the Houston branch. You will remember I wrote to all at the time the Ausust re-union
 
was being planned explaining that I did not expect to get  first pickings as John had
 
80  elegantly expressed it and that we would keep the furniture here until such t
ime as
 
it was needed by whatever family member so announced. The time is now.
 
During the mad Dallas days, Alan J. took one double bed, two s
ingle beds, one dress
ing  
table, one chest of drawers,
 Deanje
'
s desk,
 both
 living
 room
 chairs and b
oth rugs. W
e
 
have the dinding table, buffet and six chairs which belonged to your mother, one bird&&eye
 
maple dresser, one old oak dresser with mirror, and a bedroom suite which Deanie bou ht
 
-
-.two s
ingle beds, a dressing table ,  a chest of drawers,a night stand, and a small
 
table with folding leaves. Also ,  three heavy oak
 
chairs and one oak roc ker  from  your
 
father's office(I thi nk), plus  miscellaneous
 dishes and cooking utensils....pjctures
 
three small lamps, and of course,the s
ilver given to Deanie far wedding Dresents. I
 
do not have just handy the list of objects willed, but I think I remember a specific
 
bequest of the silver and the samovar to me..-.otherwise I do not recall that I would
 
be entitled to any of these other things if it came to a hair splitting decision.
 
Y
ou know the house and you -
now us and the way we live, so I think you'll all agree
 
that whether the furniture comes or goes is not going to throw anybody into a decline.
 
.
....ano to put it very bl un tl y , I love  you  deeply,
 each an
very one, and I value your
 
loving concern for me whi ch began
 before  I married
 John
 and teen seasoned and strengthened
 
through the years
 shared sorrows, sickness, and set-backs, as well as mutual ad-
miration, professional advancement, and personal triumph.  I do not want to endanger
 
this feeling with any kind of shadow(such as the one which has hung
 over Uncle Richard's
 
and Aunt 1
.ttje's heads and ex ten ded to th eir children
). So,  what
 I propose is this.
 
If each of you will write what you need and what you would like to have and when you
 
would l
ike to have it, I will undertake to find out by what method it can be shipped
 
safely and as inexpensively as possible. My preliminary investigations seem to indicate
 
that moving vans cost less than crating and freighting, which also entails pick and
 
moving at the destinati on , but th ere  may  be  some
 factors
 I've
 overlooked.
 In case all
 
tiA r e e  want the same things, what then? Draw for it, I say. .
..or does somebody have a
 
better method? In the past two years we've moved everything in the house at least once,
 
to say nothing of dismantling the Dallas house and the Clarksville house, s
o the idea of
 
shiftin6 furniture around
 bother we in the least. (
it does bother Umpty, who can
 
never understand the strange logic of moving furniture when the i
dea occurs
.-at midnight,
 
say).
 
All this sounds very formal, I know, but I'm determined to get this on pao r
 
before we all get engulfed in the Christmas confusion. Since I began the letter
 
had two interruptions( just two that counted) one, to attend the funeral of a friend,
 
aged 24 who died of a cerebral hemorrhage Just three months aft er  her  we ddi ng  and  the  
second an attempt to help Lightnin' Hopkins find out about getting back his bond money
 
after a ±
slse charge of aggravated assault had been withdrawn.
 
S
o, Alan and Anne, how about the Christmas visit to Houston? Bess and butch, v
.
xiat
 
is the latest report on life and times in a motel while entertaining a Thank sgiving
 
visitor? l
abat is the moving-in date .
.. 
still Dec.
 David is a young man who would like
 
to be engaged to Susan, but I do not believe she is ready to be engaged just yet. Shin e;,
 
what one hundred crises have befallen you at Horn Hall in the past 24 hourat Hav en
'
t seer
.
 
Susan s
ince she got back to Hous
ton  from  Lu bb ock  holidays, but I hear tell there's a

or a  aew hilarious attompts,  I hve abandoned the i
dea of writing new vers s
 
t
"ki
sses Sweeter Than Wine" to describe I
ndigo's increase. This was prompted by La
 
fact that I kept thinking of the line in Pete's version which goes "
then, oh Lorc,  I
 
as the father of ten". So, instead, I senc
' '

anine.
 
1 got the news to Susan next day at her office, a rc  she suogestec we should
 
act our folk singing friends over to build a fence, brick by brick. Of course you
 
oow I am dying to have one of the pups, but Umpty i
s still adamant about buildin'
 
a fence, and after our s
ad exieriences at having dogs and c
ats hit by c
ars,  I
 
it is an absolute necessity
 s
o I
'll just have to yearn and wait.
 
This morning, I talked to Susan and had a wonderful conversati
 '
1
.
 
which wound up with her accepting an invitation to dinner on Monday night. I ex' L
 
to her that Umpty was very upset the last time she was here because of many events
 
which had taken place during the week before we left, plus a few of Johnny' s antic,
 
over that week-end. The girl with Naomi(not the driver, the other one) was not muc
 
Leip in a mixed up s
ituation, so that by the time Susan got here on Sunday even_
 
be was in a real snit. So,  I explained to him she has been working about 18 hou
 
a day, and does so too love us, but has to s
leep sometime. Ssuan told me she har.
 
been working, and I felt free to try to explain to U. that she ,  too, has trobla,
 
in her j
ob which are irksome and am now very optimistic about a ha --
y rauric
'r on
 
onday.
 
S. says she has made uD her mind to move into a house with l
;r e aenc d
 
nrd with a friend who owns tne p
lace. She says there i
s p
lenty of room for two
 
reople and she thinks it will relieve her of the worry over the dogs being shut
 
c
ia  ail day in the house, plus help her finances. I
t i
s much closer to us and
 
'
:ore accessible than the Avondale place, and I feel sure we will get to sea bar
 
:
:ore often after she moves. W
e have offered to help her move, and she has promis d
 
to call on us if she needs us. She seemed entirely relaxed and cheerful and not at
 
all under the extreme tension which I felt this winter and spring. The house is
 
located near one of the boundary streets of the Village shopping Center, and is
 
between Bissonet and Rice Boulevard. Don't know the number nor the name of the airl
 
who owns it. She i
s a former teacher of retarded schildren in the Spring Branch
 
area, and you may have met her. Among other pressures on Susan has been the shock
 
of having her friend Kit Van Cleve  collapse and now under treatment in the Dsycca1 tric
 
ward at Methodist Hospital. She is a delightful girl I've met, formerly a reporter
 
in the weakly conservative newspaper here. One good s
ign was her report of a fight
 
;
'
5
'
ith Joe and her expressing the opinion that every time she s
aw him the time wss so
 
chart and so involved that she felt he was under a strain, but that he was absolutoiv
 
parfect in his behavior under stress....I asked her if we couldn't subsidize Joe

our latest piece of household bad luck- the refrigerator won't get

aid he would have to blow something into it. He'll probably show up
 
:ile James is in the kitchen;but I hope he does show up,because the motor has been
 
r  nning night and day without s
topping f
or five days now.
 
No connection between refrigerators and my next subject,but before
 
*:rget it,I must tell y
ou that Vida Field(s) telephoned t
o enquire about you; said
 
ey are moving to Temple this week;wants y
ou to c
ome to see them and to write. He
 
dress is 803 North 13th,Tsr
nple.-- I sent you Friday or Saturday your knitting in
 
one package, several bills forwarded and a letter for Ftsy from Lubbock as well as
 
a note and some bills end accounts in a separate envelope.
 i
ma wouldn't let me pay
 
f
or the laundry;said y
ou had taken that over and would pay her. I
've seen ier once
 
s
ince she moved;didn't see John Alan for fur days until last ni
t when Mike brou,T;t
 
i
i to see me. They live just two or three blocks from here and I went by,but di n' 
f
ind them at home. He can c
ome over and 11ay with Susan wnen she c
omes. We have phor i
 
Tsephine'e several times but haven't f
ound out whether they went to Austin or whe
 
r mother has gone on home,- haven't seen her s
ince last Sunday. Virginia called
 
again t
o inquire about you. She p
eid us one visit s
ince you left. Mr.Sharp seemz
 
he kept busy with s
ome kind of g
overnment architect business,'vhich is all t
o the
 
ood,I say, except that it keeps him away from home a good deal. I
'm sure they sr:
 
; d for that reason, too , that they moved into the aartment.
 
We,too,are distressed about N.r
ret. I r
io e she has the courage  o
 
Maybe no permanent injury is done in the early s
tages. Your father looks
 
better;he's gone again to the Y this morni
;goea two or three times a week.Ye:tsrJej
 
he was busy fixing up his will;guess that's a sane thing for anybody to do. Cf course
 
;e're wondering whether and when Chris showed up. I
'm glad you decided on Camp. Iwrots
 
out c
sysrs,didn't I
?  Alan writes the following about Bess:
 
I
 '
m waiting in my office for Bess to call me from downtown where s
 
new clothes. I don't wonder she's had her troubles in New York.
 
!
-or clothes are the worst of any young women's I
've ever known.Ve should all be
 
ashamed of ourselves.I've taken her in r
iand and I
'm going too feminize her.She's
 
taking slimming exercises day and night,she's dieting,sho's getting manicures,et'
 
i
e're having great fun living and working together". He adds: "When I
've done my
 
spate with Stith Thompson at Indiana the end of this month and spent about 3 weck
 
in Mississippi I
'm e
p ming home for a week's visit." Th.t ought to make it shout
 
the time y
ou and Bess get out,- maybe a li tle e
arlier. I he you can be here w-isr
 
Al a
n c
omes. I don't wnat you to feel 1.d about what he s
ays;if anybody,mothers in-
cluded, has ever worked harder than you to help Bess with her clothes I've never
 
known it. It's my fault,I s
uppose,that I didn't tea
c h her when she was around me
 
t
o take care of what clothes she had; for it is not the qaulity or the quantity
 
tat's been her trouble,but the lack of care,- l
osing things,throwing them around,
 
nt k eping things cleaned and pressed on time to have them ready when needed;
 
not using deodorants  hen she of all people needed them and knew it. She has swe tcl

a
 a 
t
o all of
 
arest Fat, Bob, Chris ,  Lisa, and Shirley:
 
by this time,  I hope you have heard
 
from the Johnsons with their startling news that Indigo is due to produce a
 
family early i. March. I was so floored when K. called us out of the blue to announce
 
this development I couldn't do much but stammer out your address. Gave her both
 
t
re apartment and the office. I still would like to have one of Indigo8s offspring
 
and John STILL says no, no ,  NO. Susan is very scornful of the Johnson's care of
 
Indigo, and feels that this was unauthorized and an invasion of Indigo's privacy
 
I think •
 At any rate,  if by some mischance their letters have not reached you,
 
do write to them.
 
family news is that Cousin Chloe ciÔ
 
about 10 days ago. Hart did not tell us and I learned of it indiretly through one
 
of the Penick girls who lives here and attends the same church. She had a stroke
 
and lingered about 10 days after. All the children were able to come and be with
 
her before she quietly passed away.
 
Tomny Morgan and Van have been  are
 
visiting Sue and we had a pleasant evening with them. Tommy seemed very quiet,
 
but with Sue,  Jimmie John and me to burble along, maybe he just didn't have  a
 
chance. Van was very complimentary about Susan and said she had enjoyed her  visit
 
to them in Seville. They appear to be happily settled in Rockport and have urged
 
us to visit them. His wife is warm, outgoing ,  handsome and quite a steam-0 n the
 
beam gal. She was a flight nurse during WWI on the African run, then in India, also
 
nursed in Alaska. A Canadian by birth, she has the veautiful skin and bright blue
 
eyes of the Irish .
.. 
lovely naturally curly graey hair...striking looking.
 
Sue i
s having problems with arthritis,
 
although she never complains.  .
...but has difficulty I notice sitting still  for
 
any length of time and often looks as if she is in pain. They talk of selling
 
their house, but have made no definite plans as yet announced. Sue is finding Jimmie's
 
retirement pretty trying,  I think, for she does not like to cook, and those three
 
meals a day come around pretty fast. Except for his farm, Jimmie has no hobbies
 
to occupy his time, and because of his heart attack is limited in activity,
 so I
 
think Sue is feeling the strain of retirement already. She is nervous about  driving
 
at night 01  having him drive at night, too,  so this keeps them pretty housebound.
 
Johnny seems to have turned a corner
 
in his activities at Texas and is bearing down on studies and curtailing his social
 
life.  .
...or perhaps it is as one SMU man told us "The draft makes scholars  faster
 
than we ever could " Joey is having a terrible struggle with math and chemistry, having
 
gotten himself into a major works class. He seems to be gradually branching  out a
 
little and gaining self confidence. We are still struggling with a bad case  of teen-
age skin trouble, despite weekly visits to a good dermatol gist ,  heat treatments,
 
il1a,  salves, washinii , etc.
 
Susan came by Sautrday to discuss a
 
pro'oosed trip to Boston as a delegate from hospital to a Workshop on Occupational
 
Therapy. She seems to think the state will pay her way,  but will leaver her hanging
 
until the last minute to advise her. She looked so darling in black slacks,  a
 
lush sweater she bought in Europe and her hair in semi-pig-tails  .  When I ask about
 
Joe, she always says he is just fine .
... 
period. Joey told me David called once while
 
he was there,  so I do not feel the romance with Joe is warm as Joe would like it to
 
be. Several times lately when we have invited her to do things she has said  she has
 
a date with a doctor, unnamed. I have the feeling that until she reaches some kind of
 
goal she has set for herself, she is not willing to get too involved .
... 
but  this is
 
just a hunch, not something she has told me.  The situation with Mrs. Shelton has not
 
improved, and she(Susan) now says she wants to stick it out for a year, and then try
 
for another post. Meanwhile she is enjoying her Bcout work and her art work.

I am  enclosing an i
des I had for the brownie's. Let each little girl
 
make her own likeness for a scrap book cover. Use brown domestic for girl's
 
dresses and caps .
.. 
thread the general color of hair. You will have to pre-cuct
 
faces, eyes, mouths and caps from construction paper .
.. 
or maybe the whole
 
i
dea can just be strung out over more t an one meeting. The other idea I had
 
was for the good old game of concentration.....about 12 objects pertaining to
 
scounts on a tra, covered. —then uncover and see who can remember the most.
 
One of best indoor games I snow is a treasure n u

ula kleenex carnations are sure fire for decorations and don't cost much.
 
These are just random ideas, of course, since I don't know enough about that
 
age group of girls to guess what would appeal or whether you ar  required to
 
nmett challenges, etc.
 
John is Going fine. No word from Bes: or Alan late. Latest project is a
 
bok being printed and illustrated by a wonderful young man who visited us
 
last week ,  interested in the old manuscript originated for Stith Thompson
 
and now being published as a labor of love  by William witliff of Austin.
 
By the way, he hit t e celirig when he found a Faulkner among the Omax bo3 k3,
 
and says hang on to it .

 rca L y  believe there is a great break t
hrough
 
i
r  al
l of US ... 
yo u  and D
ie and John and Susan and
 
r
uie and eat. I have finally been able to see
 
whole situation in a different light
 not
 
as a result of group th. rapy, but as a reauLt
 
of r al hard searching for a clue as to why tnree
 
young peo le broke down at about the same age,
 
al
l in t
ue s
 ane family,  and why k
'at is so unha
 
t
jrls ar
ia Lisa are havi n
g school problems, and
 
perhaps why Nick h.s ap;eared to have some prob-
LCi1S  adjusting to people his own age.  .
...ani why
 
i have been so blocked anu blind for so  long.  It
 
seems to me that all of us have tried to measure
 
up to an ideal family situation which we ima ined
 
iro n the
.. descriptions we heard from all the 'stories
 
of your happy childhood
 and eac.a of us individu
 
ally Pelt we could not come up to this pattern.
 
.
..but  e kept on tryi n
g, anyway.
 
The other part of the
 
:tury is that i believe people marry in an attempt
 
t
o p
' at a pattern of thei r own  childhoo d if it 
as  ve ry  ha py, or to avoid a pepeat of an
 
wiriapp y  situation if that is the-way they saw the
 
,clati ,-
,nship or their own parents .
... and that's
 
here I come in. i
-
ay ow n mother, grandmother, and
 
:nt were so strong and so bossy,  and my father
 
so gentle and self effacing,  I saw him as almost
 
s etting plowed under. So, I married a man of
 
s
irong convictions ,  feeling that the father, not
 
Lie mother should be the head of the household. In
 
iJ  atteiupts r
iot to be bossy and not to be too
 
ossesive a mother,  I think now that I curbed my
 
x
iatural impulse to follow my own ideas and to
 
ursue my own interests in my zeal to be the
 
erfect kind of mother you all felt you had,
 
nd to avoid the pressures on my children which
 
own mother, gran d
mother and aunt put on me.

Dearest Shirley,
 
I don't know how I will hc
 ic to  :
ct all oir news into t
his
 
ridiculous space, but I
'll try.  As may have reached you second-
hand, Corey is getting married June 19th.
 I don't suppose there is
 
any chance you could be around for the wedding, but maybe the mar-
ried couple could I
i
ieet you in Europe this summer!  They are planniw.
 
to spend their whole wad on a trip to Europe, probably not practi-
cal, but then really I
'm for it.  Having the money and time both
 
at once doesn't come along too often for us, does it?  Their exacL
 
plans are still uncertain, but I
'll let you know about them as scoa
 
as may be; surely, they could come your way during part of those
 
three months, or you theirs.
 
The groom to be is Michael Denos, a senior in Political Sci-
ence at Berkeley -
-
 a nice boy and a smart one.  He is an honors
 
student in Poli Sci and will go on to graduate school either in
 
his own field or law.  Actually, I think his heart is in teaching;
 
he has been working at a school for mongoloid children this past
 
year and speaks of them with much affection -
-
 past summers he has
 
counselled at camp and worked on city playgrounds so he should be a
 
relatively experienced  father.
 In any case he and Corey are much in
 
love and have been going together over a year.
 Though I wish they 
C
OVO wait until they finish school, Mike is 21 and Corey 20; Mike has only a s:w
 
go and Corey is working for her credential which will take a year afte::
 
i
ation in any case, so since they seem to feel they can swing it finan'i - .
 
I don't feel I should worry too much.  (
I guess I shouldn't have writ-
ten on the gum
 part; I
'll try to ink the above remarks in so they're
 
understandable.) 
M g
 
My own position has been in jeapordy out at the college but af-
ter a great deal of hassle I have been offered another year's con-
tract.
 I really would prefer not to accept, but I may.  At the mo-
ment I keep putting things off until after the wedding!  We are start
 
ing into our middle age change of life, I guess, and now would be a
 
good time to reorganize; Nick will be going to S.F. State next fall
 
and Butch and I don't really need this big old place.  Further com- 
z
 
alicating matters is that B
. has been sick almost all year and it
 
looks as though I may have to have surgery this summer -
-
 fibroid
 
tumors in the uterus, nothing alarming -
-
 but we won't get the final r z
 
decision on that for another week or two.  Naomi, that old sweetie,
 
has declared that she will stay home and hold down the house if I
 
M C
l 
have to be sick for a while, so there will be no problem there.
 I
 
0 E
D
 
really think that one reason I haven't written all year t is that e-
verything has been so congenttzally and chronically up-in-the-air. 
m
 
very week I would think that one more week would find some prob'ems
 
close to resolving but no.  Anyway, it looks as thought we may have
 ,
 
a wedding, an operation, a house-selling, a move and a new job hunting
 
Al the same summer!
 I am gathering my strength. 
r
 
The Bessie book is still unfinished,  though I try to get some
 
done every week.
 I hope to get it done before the wedding, though I
 
suppose that's really fantasy.
 I haven't heard from Alan at all and
 
little from Johnny and Margaret; I will get on the phone one of these
 
days if nothing else.  The sweater for Nick arrived; it is beauti-
ful, fits and he wears it -
-
 a mpnenomenon which has really sur-
prised me, N. being in the clothes-picky stage.  He looks very h-nd
 
some in it and I think you're wonderful to have gotten it done with
 
all the else you;ve had to do.
 Every now and again we get a
 
Eorwarded from you.
 I hope your trip has been truly wonderful and
 
I do love you very much though I don't act as though I do.
 Just
 
hold the thought somewhere handy.  And give my love to Pat and
 
Bob when you see them; also to your sweet Susan when you write her
 
next.
 She sent us such a lovely box this Christmas -
-
 all things
 
she had made and all lovely.  Much love to you honey, and I
'll
 
write again, now I
'm over the worst of the r
r
iogrims, as soon as I
 
know what the kids are up to.
 
I have more room than I

other news, Naomi has pretty definitely decided on tackling med.
 
school, Nick has his drivers license finally (the last one I will
 
ever teach) and I am having a paper published in Western Folklore,
 
Butch is on Municipal Court Jury for a month and the dogs are shed-
ding and temporarily not pregnant. So we go on...

ear (crdons ana  Shirley:
 
e were so delighted to have the pictures of
 
Chris and Lisa. They have j
oined the fam ly art gallery in our bedroom
 
ano I enjoy looking at them every day. Many thanks for sending them.
 
As so pleased to have your letter, Pat. I have no kept up my good in-
tentions to write to you direttly,  since I have been sending letters to
 
Shirley each time we get an address.  .
...and feeling that they may catch
 
uo  with her by the time she gets  back  to  America,  am  me  year.
 
Let me clear up the question about the lovely,
 
lovely,  gold olacques. In some letter of Shirley's there was a reference
 
to maybe shipping a package here ,  which we were to re-wrap and send to
 
Dorothy Garner...But how delighted I am to know that these were intended
 
for us. We will treasure them you know, and I have put them over the
 
mantel where I delight in them daily, although Susan and Joey feel that
 
I have hung them "too square". Not being very gifted with off-center
 
arrangements,  I just put them in line with the clock and the old gold
 
angle placque of Deanie's and enjoy it as a grouping of gifts from near and
 
dear.
 
The packages for Susan(2) came yesterday, and I am
 
taking them to her tonight when we meet at the Jewish Com. Center for one
 
of John's singing programs. Talked with her yesterday and she sounded chipper
 
and busy. In case no other letters have gotten through from her .
... she  did
 
visit Alan in New York,  she did see Joe there,  she did feel the conference was
 
a great success, and she thinks she can stick it out here until May 1
 to get
 
her vacation leave
 ,  and then wants to go elsewhere. She says she wants to
 
be somewhere in a city which offers art instruction, for she is enjoying her
 
independent art work very much. I have no seen any of her paintings, and do
 
r
,,
-,t know whether i
t is her natural shyness or whether I should press harden.
 
'
 
e have been in one of our typical churns about
 
urbishing up the house. After getting three estimates on painting ,  we set
l
u
 
ut to learn what we could about aluminum siding. I was reluctant to go into it,
 
but John feels he wants to get this place fixed up as well as we can to cut
 
down on the continual painting required in this climate. So, we looked at
 
houses for days,  searched out applicators, etc. etc. and now have it covered
 
in alumnium siding about the color it was .
.. 
a little more brown in it and with
 
a slight pinkish cast. I sounds awful, but actually it is a soft,  soft beige
 
which looks nice with the black roof. Have also made a concerted eff rt to get 
r
n
 
rid of junk in yard, and as soon as the painters get through, we are going to 
0
 
o some planting across the front. .
.mostly shrubs of the evergreen variety, and
 
have laid a little walk among the ajuga and monkey grass plot out the kitchen
 
window. Joey is now reaching the critical age where his poor, doddering old
 
corny parents can do nothing right, but we steam along working and prodding him
 
despite this barrage of scorn.
 
Going to Austin for week-end of Texas Folklore
 
Society and to visit in Johnny s apartment, being vacated by his buddies for
 
the week-end. If you can give us a Paris address, we will write there. Am
 
saving all your letters, for I want you to write, Mrs. Shirley, and to tell
 
and show when you return.
 
I am hoping to go to Corey's wedding, but all
 
cepenos on the cate.  .
..Our neighbor next door tells me her son is going
 
to work in Zurich this summer. He is Johnn&s buddy from 2 years old on,
 
and if he ever calls up or apcears, he is a sol&dcitizen and a darlin boy.
 
hame is Jack Thomas.
 Johnny plans to go to summer school and hopes to
 
get a degree in history by Feb. 1
, if the draft doesn't pull him in before.
 
He has not gotten a draft notice yet.
 
We love you one and all and we are writing
 
even though I am sure Shirley must feel she has been abandoned.
 
Fond greetings to the visiting Gordons,
 
and auch love to those in residence.
 
Devotedly

... 
trjs might require some

special schooling, but I know such work is offered in California and when  I go to
 
Corey's wedding I plan to find out about it. Am writing to a friend out there who is u

mile-long corridors at Teach seems so hard on you and such a time and energy con-

Susan has departed as of last Friday for a trip to Mexico 
m.
 
with Molly,  searching for uncut gems and investigathing craft centers. She says very c
 
little about leaving now,  I don
'
t know  wheth er  she plans
 to  bide
 her  time
 until
 she  
has some definite plan in mind, or whether she has learned to get along with Mrs. S
 
by skillfully evading her. Sh e men

Johnny apent last week-end with us, and I am happy to re-
nort that he seems more relaxed, less strained, and more pleasant to have around than
 
he has been in years. Still has the extra wei ght which is no help to hi s appearance
,
 
but his general attitude thwar
d the fam i
l y and his studies is miraculou sly improve
d.
 
hick was here, too,  still the same f
.
.mily situation. His mother went out of her
 
may to snub me in the store recently, but I smiled warmly and passed by.  Johrr
 is
 
changing apartments for summer school, and planning to take Accounting, along
 
w
ith his extra history courses. He is coming home today to work until summer
 
session starts, end of next week.
 
Just in case you missed the letter telling Joey's
 
big news, he is to be co-editor of the school newspaper next year. Offered the
 
editorship, but turned it down because he felt he did not have enough experienc .
 
He has suddenly gotten intered in fishing, and after much agaonizing, he bbou,  t
 
a fly-rod with his birthday money, originally intended for an extra set of t
n
nr
 
ohones for his radio,  but carefully saved to be surk that was what he really
 
wanted. He practices in the yard and in the par and has had one fishin g trio.
 
Also is intered in swimming and has  ma de a new boy friend at school who seems
 
to be a get-up-and go-er.
 
Am sending a letter today also in care American
 
xpress London ,  which Anne sent us to mail to you. She merely said her j
ob
 
was going well and that she has been accepted for Columbia in the fall. Johnny
 
Faulk told John that Alan' s incum
ben t came to him in tears before you got to
 
New York,  saying that Alan was using pour visit as an excuse to oust her, and
 
I suppose she has moved in as a permanent tenant with Anne gone to the Village
 
to live. ie get brief notes from Alan, mostly just saying how busy he is, and

that you will know what's happened to your purchases----and I gather that some
 
of our letters of thanks and notification of things received have not reached
 
You. The gloves are a real delight ,  as is the plastic sun bonnet which came
 
in the gems packag and also the cross stitch pre-cut embroidery package. The
 
two gem packages for Susan have arrived and been delivered. Think that covers
 
l
l mailings you mentioned and which we have received. I continue to delight
 
in the plaques. I back-ordered ski pants from Sears from the catalog .
... 
they
 
came too small, had to be returned and re-ordered, and by this time, news of
 
the return to Moline came so I sent the second batch back to Sears. Am sending
 
uoks to Moline in care of Betty for  Chris an d Li sa
'

lts.  Incidentally lust letter I sent to you was in care of the John Deere
 
c
i:ice in Madrid, hoping it would catch you somewhere along the line, by
 
caurtesy of Lanz Iberica.  Wrote Pat and Bob congratulating him on rrnrnotion
 
and sent to Captain Haya a
ddress before the deadline date Pat gave.
 
We have given up trying to figure out the car situation,
 
so will just repeat. We will return it to you in good condition, with Joey the jud

t —
 
anu taking the great bulletin you sent  •  She was pretty as a picture in'
 
o1d -scrolled cotton slack suit, wit, her hair up. She says she is very tired
 
because of her over load of intern, who is impossible, and two people who are
 
euprosed to be observing and who never  should have been admitted into the Health
 
field,  but she was really peppy with us and we all enjoyed her vivist. Says she
 
has found a wonderful place she wants to return to .
.. San Miguel, Mexico, but tnit
 
due to the shortage of jobs in Mexico,  there is no way for any American to work
 
there. She says they are manufacturin,,  j
obs for the Mexicans, and that even so,
 
they are not conquering their over-Do  ulation and underemployment problems, so
 
that no outsiders are welcome, no matt er what their qualifications and experience
 
are, -and jobs are given to the native,  •  She had much car trouble, despite having
 
a thorough and expensive overaul  ont  just before she left. I
s now trying out a
 
small car  Austin-Mealy,  i think, wit h a plan to buy. We tried to suggest that her
 
Ludget would really
 be shot with car  payments, and that perhaps a better i
dea
 
would be to keep the old on e runnin
 for a while longer, but she says it is SO
 
th oroughly un dependable that she ha
 no faith in anybody keeping it in any kind of
 
re liable running 'order* She finally
 .
ismissed the subject with,  "Don't you worry about
 
it.. 1 will work something out myself  "....so, we made her promise she would call on us
 
whenever she felt we could help her,
 nd changed the subject. When I asked about Joe
 
she just smil ed and  said
 he  was  all  r

you last week-end ,

in the triumph of my husband-your brother .

think it must be some lingering idea that they
 
connot compete with karse John that makes both
 
ian and John so jittery about this particular
 
group, when they c a n  get up aid perform without
 
near the strain to 10,000 peoplel At any rate,
 
I think it really did give ma
iy people a new
 
slant on John and I was proud as i
'
-unch that he
 
pulled if off so successfully.
 
We had a deli iiuiul trip
 
home with John and Susan rea iy having a good
 
exchange of ideas and great fun all around.uur
 
stop at a roadside barbecue stand was fun....
 
run by Lightnin's cousin ..."T. D  and Sara
 
Donaldson.
 
In the c
ourse of the drive,
 
Susan mentioned that she was aware the contract
 
signing time was coming up and she didn't know
 
what to say to you about it....she feels that
 
she may leave Galveston, maybe,  a
ria that she
 
does not wat to commit you to a task of house-
keeper aid baby raiser when you should have
 
your own life to do what you want to do. I
 
pointed out that few things in life were
 
more satisfying than being near the ones you
 
love and feeling needed by them ,
 but I did
 
not attempt to advise.... just  saying I did
 
not think you would regard this as a
 
sacrifice, but a joyous experience.
 
I realize how ticklish a situation it is,
 
but I ceitainly regard this as a crisis in Susants
 
liie where she needs a
l 1 the loving attention she
 
0  0  
can get from a
l l of us
 whether she feels she

 needs it or not right now... and I

ednesuay ni ht  .
hen we haa a wonderiul
 
visit with Susan. She looked so can ing in gold slacks and a brilliant floworeo
 
blouse, with her hair in a new and very becoming style. She had said she had to
 
leave at 7:15 to go to jewelry class,  so I had supner ready promptly at 6
, but
 
we all got to talking and laughing about her description of the daily crises
 
during the New York trip that somehow the time slipped away and it was 8:)C
 
before any of us remembered it. She was relaxed, charming and so witty and
 
funny she had us all in gales. She says she is really relieved about the move,
 
once she made up her mind to relinquish the large spacious upstairs apartment ,
 
and feels that having a good place for the dogs and help with the finances a
 
the rent is taking two big problems off her mind. She likes the girl she
 
sharing a house with, and feels that she is a stable, busy, well balaricec
 
D
erson, not given to alarms and excursions like Molly. The girl's name is
 
1
4ary Ann Shaw, from Fort Worth, a former teacher of the handicapped in tthe
 
Spring Branch school System, now working at some kind of vocational rehabili-
tation j
ob and looking ahead to the establish ant of a sheltered worksho p for
 
mental ly retarded girls. The address is 2509 Quenby, the phone Jackson 
She not only had to move all of her things, but also had to move all of the
 
things Molly stored with her. At this point, of course,  she is desperately
 
tired, and says she will never, no, never move again, but she is so pleased t
c
 
have it all done. She has given a cat to Joyce,  since Molly left hers there
 
with her, and I believe Mary Ann has one. Her new housemate also has a doc cr
 
two, once of which Joyce reports is "a African hound". She reDorted Mary Ann
 
as saying their house would be t e only place in Houston where those who wish'd
 
could look at TV while sitting in a closet
 They have four(Molly's, Ssusn's
 
and two for Ml), plus two stereo record players, three radios, and I think
 
MA also has tape recording equipment. Anyway ,  the whole set-up sounds gay
 
and think it is a wonderful step forward for Susan. As I told you ,  it is
 
far more accessible to us, and Susan says she will be able to get here more
 
easily and more often with some of her nroblems now solved. Her friend Kit,
 
by the way,  is out of the i

She was loud in her praise o
f Alan for linding the place on Long
 
Island and for assembling all the members of the clan,  each of whom bencfitted
 
greatly by his gracious and generous hospitality, but also because of his loving
 
interest in every one under his roof. She also had many words of praise for
 
the manuscript you have started about your dorm experiences and is hoping you
 
will continue to work on it as you can. d

This week we go back to Dr. Chamberlin for interpretation of the
 
test uede Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, and we hope the resumption of the
 
thyroid medication. There are indications of a small trace of tissue in the
 
neck area( judging by the sound of the machine and the little information prized
 
out of the doctor who had to administer test manually because the machin e was
 
not functioning properly automatically), and of course this was an awful  blow
 
to both of us, but it is quite possible that this might have been a mechanical
 
misrepresentation of the machine itself, and also with only slight traces, it
 
may be possible to follow a course of treatment without further surgery right
 
now. Have a tentative appointment for Tuesday afternoon, and will let you hear

company. It's a joy to watch Susan and Krishna together, and I continue
 
to marvel at the skill Susan has in this new role. On this occasion ,

in f

trial, his travels, and the Austin scene. He really is a spell binder as
 
a raconteur, and a joy to be with on any occasion. He reports that he w s
 
recently in New York on business and met Stephanie who is Alan's present
 
love. He reports that she is far and away the most wonderful woman who has
 
ever been in Alan's life and he hopes this will develop into a permanent
 
t liance. He emphasized several times that she is calm, serene, capable,
 
and non-competitive. He also said that the last heard of Joan is  that she
 
went to Paris where she met and married a Negro poet who boasted of being
 
able to live on seven cents a day, that they went to Africa, but after a
 
short stay, Joan was stricken with Hepatitis, returned to the U. S. ai d

rue latest idea of Hice seniors is to cancel their rc alia
 
orders a n d  donate the 46 to the 6tudents Committee to hnd the  ar in
 
Vietnam... leaving the college book store on campus to pay for those
 
already received and not used...they are allowed a 51

but the studnnt committee on campus is circulating the news by way of
 
mimeographed bulletins that the book store will not have to pay for them.

Joe has been swalloed up in exams and end o  school projects,

bulletin boards which rezrLjn as they were in 1968...and I cringe every
 
time I pass them in the hall.I'm determined to get along with her, but
 
it's one of those walking on eggs situations.She is so quick and so
 
capable...but so negative.Never mind she'
