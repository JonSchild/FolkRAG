IT IS GOING TO RAIN 
Someone said it is going to rain. 
I think it is not so. 
Because I have not felt the earth and the way it holds still 
in anticipation. 
I think it is not so. 
Because I have not yet felt the sky become heavy with moisture of 
    preparation. 
I think it is not so. 
Because I have not yet felt the winds move with their coolness. 
I think it is not so. 
Because I have not yet inhaled the sweet, wet dirt the winds bring. 
So, there is no truth that it will rain.
