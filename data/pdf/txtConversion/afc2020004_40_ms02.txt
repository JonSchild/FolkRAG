[Ofelia Zepeda reads “B ‘o E-a:g maṣ ‘ab Him g Ju:kĭ/It is Going to Rain”] 
 
Ofelia Zepeda:  This poem, “B ‘o E-a:g maṣ ‘ab Him g Ju:kĭ/It is Going to Rain,” is of course a 
bilingual piece. It’s written in the O’odham language. The O’odham language is my first 
language, a language of course that came from my family. It was the only language of the home 
as I grew up, and so was used regularly and I grew up speaking the language and then learning 
English after going to school. The O’odham language is spoken here in southern Arizona, and 
also in northern Sonora, Mexico: this whole area, which are of course the traditional lands of 
the O’odham. There are many O’odham speakers still; however, like many other languages, it is 
an endangered language. And that is based on the fact that we have mostly adult speakers and 
very few children who are learning the language in the natural setting.  
 
Anyway, a little about the poem itself. When I first started writing, the first pieces I wrote were 
in O’odham and that was primarily for my students who were learning how to read O’odham. 
We produced small amounts of writing, creative writing, poems, in the language so that we 
could have something to read in the classroom as we were becoming literate or I was teaching 
them how to read and write the language. So, I feel very comfortable writing in O’odham. And 
then, of course, eventually I moved into English, and now I will write either in O’odham and 
English or just O’odham and then other times just English.  
 
So, this was an early piece, and I enjoyed this piece because it has some various things that you 
can find in it, of course. You know, the connection to the landscape is certainly there. Also, for 
me personally, it’s an indication of the way that, at least, my family, my parents and all of their 
generation, the way that they lived. That is, they spent a lot of their lifetime in the outdoors 
and I noticed, you know, very early on as they spent time outdoors, they were very observant 
of the movement, especially in the environment, right around them. And they would comment 
on it, especially in the summertime when the changes are so dramatic, you know, with clouds 
and thunderstorms and dust storms, and you know, really dramatic lightning shows and so 
forth. And anyway, so I paid attention when my parents commented on them and, you know, 
said different things about these natural events. And then of course they knew what would 
happen before the rains came maybe, and then after, what happens after the rains come. And 
so all of that was instilled in me, and so growing up and then of course as an adult. I appreciate, 
you know, spending time outside and watching the changes in the environment and then, in my 
case, being able to use some of those images in the things that I write.  
 
This particular piece, I noticed that I chose to sort of copy or replicate the patterns that occur in 
O’odham traditional songs. Many O’odham traditional songs are about the environment around 
the people and these songs oftentimes are very flattering, that is, you know, about clouds and 
so forth. And they say it has a purpose when you sing good things about clouds, good things 
about animals and so forth. You know, that it’s all beneficial, to everyone actually. Anyway, so 
when I understood that about O’odham songs, then it made sense to me that it could also work 
in poems, and so I, you know, took advantage of that kind of style. Then of course, obviously, 
songs have lots of repetition, so this poem does that as well. That was a very conscious act on 
my part about this particular piece. 
 
And so it works well in O’odham, and then luckily it also carried over into English and so those 
of us that live in the Southwest, if you’re only an English speaker, understanding what is the 
information that is in the English form. People do tend to react to it, or reflect on it. And they 
agree, they say “yes, this is what happens just before it rains, or after it rains” having spent time 
here in the Southwest.  
 
The one thing that I have in this poem which I find to be sort of distinctly O’odham, that is when 
they say that “there’s no truth that it’s going to rain.” And I’ve written about this before in 
another piece, that O’odham spend a lot of time in the summer—because this is our monsoon 
season, when the rains come and the clouds are so dramatic and so forth—O’odham spend a 
lot of time watching the clouds come over the mountains and you never know when it’s going 
to rain. Some of them look like they definitely will and then they just sort of dissipate after a 
while or the rain never hits the ground. And so those are the clouds that people will say, and I 
used to hear my mother and my aunt say this about those kinds of clouds, that they were liars, 
they lied to us. And so O’odham like to watch clouds and guess if it’s actually going to bring rain 
or not. That particular line about “no truth that it’s going to rain,” it comes from that 
experience with people who make those kinds of claims about the rain. And then O’odham, 
some O’odham, pride themselves in knowing or being able to guess without the benefit of a 
weather report, of course, and predicting which clouds will bring you rain and which ones 
won’t. 
 
Anyway, so you might think of it as a pastime, but traditionally for O’odham it was very 
important, you know, to anticipate rain and then when you do get rain—because we are in the 
desert—we are a desert, and so rain is very important whether it’s during the monsoon season 
in the summertime or else, in the winter we have, we talk about “small rains” in the winter, late 
fall, early winter, are different points of rain here in the Southwest. 
 
So, anyway, I think this piece kind of reflects on those images, the metaphors and the usages 
that are in O’odham songs and then of course, as I said, my own personal experience, my 
family’s experience, and the way they lived, lived outdoors, and of course the observations that 
they made in the summertime, in waiting for the rain and in predicting rain in different ways. 
So, anyway, so those are some of the things I want to mention about this particular piece. 
Thank you.
