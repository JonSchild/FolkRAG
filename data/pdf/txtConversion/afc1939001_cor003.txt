[Letter from Alan Lomax to John A. Lomax; Port
Aransas, TX]
January 21, 1939
Mr. John A. Lomax Port Aransas, Texas
Dear Father:
The “Fiddler-crab Song” was delightful according to Bess, Elizabeth, myself, Doctor
Spivacke, Mr. Waters, Miss Rogers, Miss Andrews, and all and sundry who have seen it.
That you have not received acknowledgment is due, first, to the coldness of heart induced
by the climate and the tempo of life in these parts, and second, to straight ingratitude. Try
to forgive us all collectively.
I bought Bess for Christmas a large camel's hair coat costing about $39.00, and had to
spend the rest of the money on Library b?siness. When I get paid back I shall buy myself a
$21.00 Christmas present in kind memory.
I was as astonished as you were to find the American Ballads and Folksongs in the
“Oxford Book of Light Verse.” Also, to hear that two of our songs were in Marc Connoly's
recent flop “Everywhere I roam” without acknowledgement. Also to learn that our version,
word for word, of Jessie James was used in “Missouri Territory”, another Broadway
production.
One more word about Bess. She is already something of a leader on the Bryn Mawr
campus, because of her charm, earnestness and intelligence. She is very happy there and
is growing in every sort of way, probably too fast to be able to write about it well.

I can't find the?opy of American Ballads and Folk-songs you mentioned in your letter of
the 15th, but I have talked the matter of rev'sion of the music over with Spivacke, Waters
and Mr. Seeger. They all feel that extensive correction of Mary Gresham's work has to
be done, and do not feel that Mr. Strunk's correction would be sufficient. A number of the
songs will have to be corrected directly from the records, and it seems best to have one p?
rson do most of the job.
A little more about the machine — Doctor Spivacke is anxious to find out how long a trip
you want to make,?o that he may make out the necessary request for mileage and per
dien. The machine will be ready a month from now, probably, depending on what condition
the Detroit thieves left it in. We need some good acetate recordings of work-songs for
possible inclusion in the suggested album for Pan-American republics, etc., and I suggest
that you go by Huntsville, Darington, and the other prison farms in Texas and Arkansas,
and stay as long as you can and get bang-up recordings of group work-songs, also as
many blues with guitar accompaniment as possible. We have made one fairly serious
mistake all along, and that is not repeating songs until really good 2 recordings were made
in all cases. The disks and needles you will be using this time are going to make a lot of
difference in the quality of the records you can make.
I have one town in Kentucky which I suggest you visit — Salyersville, about a hundred
miles south of Ashland. The best banjo player I ever heard and one of the best mountain
singers lives there. His name is Walter Williams. Another singer there of great interest
is Clay Walters. I can give you other names if you decide to go. It seems a great shame
not to keep closely in touch with such a remarkable person as Roscoe MacLean, and
not to make some additional recordings of his voice. On your way through Louisiana, if
you come that way, why not try to run down the story of the Batson affair. It is one of the
most interesting of American ballads and about which even Gordon has practically no
information. I can give you some good names in New Orleans, too, of early jazz musicians
who know folksongs and jazz tunes which were not written down. Elizabeth's uncle lives in

a little town in the no-man's-land on the Texas edge of Louisiana. Elizabeth says that he
has a natural amateur's interest in folksongs and knows all the fiddlers and singers of that
section, and he could probably lead you to very good material. All of which, in addition to
contacts you have, sounds like a good month and a half of work. I hope you can arrange
this trip to stay in prison camps longer than you have hitherto been able, and don't forget
Bowlegs, for Heaven's sake, he is one of the great and when he gets out of Parchman will
be lost to us forever.
About the great Lake songs, I know Mr. Walton quite well and last summer recorded a
number of his songs in Michigan. I think I can get permission for us to use four or five of
them and I shall pick these out in the process of looking at the records.
Mrs. Seeger and I are going to spend all this afternoon and as much time as we can get to
in the next few days on the ballad book.
Please let me know as soon as you can about the loan.
Love,
AL a
P. S. I shall get copyright on the two cowboy songs looked up this afternoon.
