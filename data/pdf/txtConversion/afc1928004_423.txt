PREFACE. 
JOHN PATTERSON, 
THE " RAMBLER FROM CLARE" AND CELEBRATED IRISH CLOWN'. 
TnEnn are at present very few, if any, clowns connected with 
the arenic profession who have in so short a 
period achieved so 
Puqualified a 
success as the subject of the present sketch. 
In 
former years clowning meant to appear in the ring and make 
grimaces at the audience, being at th.e 
same time attired in a 
droll dress or costume. 
It was very seldom, if ever, that a 
clown was called upon to give utterance or expression to 
speech, except in the way of answering a child's conundrum, 
or else in attempting to spell some such word as stovepipe or 
Constantinople. 
At the present stage of the game, however, 
to be a 
clown means to be possessed of a 
proper knowledge 
of the English language, in addition to being able to dis-
course upon matters, men, and things apropos to the times 
and the occasion, 
Mr. Patterson, while being witty, is also 
classical and refined in his witticisms. 
The New York Sunday 
Despatch thus speaks of Mr. Patterson : " His jokes and witti-
cisms -are original, buoyant, and piquant, his manner easy, and 
speech free from any slangisms or vulgarity. 
His songs are 
written by himself, and are full of raal Irish humor. 
Patter-
son, unlike a 
great many other so-called delineators of Irish 
character, tries to elevate his countrymen in the eyes of the 
public, in place of degrading them." 
Mr. Patterson has been engaged as the only and original 
Irish clown by the Great London Circus for the season of 1878, 
His ,c2on , Books are for sale in every city in the country, and 
are replete with the very best character of Irish and American 
songs and ballads. 
4 
NOTICES OF THE PRESS. 
JOHNNY PArrEnsoN, Irish clown, who has but recently come to Amer-
ica, is winning golden opinions from the press and people wherever he ap-
pears. 
It is seldom that one who comes from Europe unheralded, as did 
Mr. Patterson, becomes a 
public favorite in so short a 
time. Among the 
many complimentary netices of the press, we make room for the following: 
" 
One great feature and specialty of the London Circus is the Irish clown, 
Johnny Patterson. 
He is originally witty, and a 
thoroughbred Paddy.' " 
—Meriden Duily R.Tubliran, May 14, 1877. 
" 
There are three or four clowns, but chief among them is Patterson, an 
Irishman, who makes no effort to conceal his nativity, and his drollery is 
rich and delieious."—Dosiou Daily AdrertisQr, June 5. 
" 
The several clowns were as good as ever, but Mr. Johnny Patterson 
seems to ha \ e 
sArnick a 
new vein of humor, and his Irish cecentricities 
pro k 
ed unusually a 
musing."—lies'en Daily L'iyoiny Traveler, June 5, 1877. 
" 
It is often remarked that circuses are all alike, and that there is noth-
ing which can be put into them that is new. 
This is not the fact with the 
London, for they hove one oriental feature at least. That is an Irish clown 
in the torm of John Patterson. 
This man is very tunny, as might be ex-
pected, his Irish dta;ect being natural and ea.sy. and Ins jokes and stories 
told with a 
freshness somewhat at variance with the old style of years 
past."—Besten arraid, June 5. 
" 
The clowns, and part icularly the Irishman, Johnny Patterson, played 
the fool with ' wisdom,' and won hearty and deserved applause."—Purtlaud 
Daily Press, June 23, 1877. 
" 
The Celtic humorist, John Patterson, is one of the freshest and bap. 
piest clowns to be found on the sawdust anywhere."—Buffalo Daily Courier, 
Sept. 15, 1877. 
" 
Certainly the most original of clowns is Johnny Patterson, an Irishman 
who never tires of singing in praise of his native land, and whose song, 
I'il Meet Her in the Garden Where the Putties Grow,' is becoming one 
of the most popular refrains of the day."— Evening Telegram, New York, 
Nov. 28, 1877. 
"Johnny Patterson, the Irish clown, is assuredly one of the features. 
He is funny, principaLy because he is original. 
Neither does Mr. Patter-
son endeavor to cultivate success at the expense of 1.is nationality, for he 
warbles of the glories of his native and with the gusto of one who is proud 
of the Emerald Isle."— New York Daily News, Nov. 22, 1877. 
"PERSONAL—JOHN PATTEESf ' N. — This great wit, a 
new importation. not 
only a 
clown, but a 
Celtic clown, is not one of the least of the attractions 
belonging to the Great London Show."—Torono Daily Leader, Aug. 18, 
1877. 
" 
All of us liked Patterson, the Irish clown. I 
admire that song about 
meeting her in the garden where the 
putties' grow. 
For me there is a 
minor-key cadence of pathos about it which is charming,."— The Illustrated 
Dramatic and Spoiling News, New York, Dee. 15, 1877. 
" 
The epieramatie and worthy sayings of Johnny Patterson were such as 
could be appreciated without any strainingor overdoing it."— The Chatham 
Tri-{reekly, Ontario, Aug. 731, 1877. 
" 
Mr. Patterson, the Irish clown, who recently made such a 
favorable 
impression at the Great London Circus, has appeared at the Comique, 
where he has been one of the many attractions of that favorite resort. Mr. 
Patterson, who is a 
native of the County Clam, is one of the best specialists 
in his line of the profession."— The irish American, New York, Jan. 19, 
187g.

M OLL M cCUE. 
Written and sung by JOHNNY PATTERSON. 
Ant.—" What Can't be Cured," etc. 
COME all you loyal and true-hearted lovers, 
And lend an ear to my doleful tale, 
Shure cruel Cupid has driven me stupid, 
And alone I 
wander through each hill and dale. 
My true love's gone, and left me behind her ; 
Arrah, neighbors, tell me what must I 
do ! 
Oh, I 
search in vain ! 
I 
ever find her, 
My darling fair one, poor Moll McCue ? 
When first I 
saw her 'twas on a 
Sunday evening, 
As through the green fields I 
chanced to stray, 
Where the lark and linnet, more proud than Spinnett, 
Sang most melodious on every spray. 
No haythen goddess e'er looked so modest, 
With her curly locks and her eyes so blue. 
Your Venetian ladies may go to Brady's, 
They're only paper to Moll McCue.

So, hurrah for the captain, and the officers, too ; 
Hurrah for the engineers, and likewise the crew ; 
Hurrah for oar stewards ; they were always up to time. 
Oh, there's grand accommodation on the Canard 
Our saloon passengers they were few—just a 
little above 
two dozen. 
We had on board Sir William Vernor, Bart., his lady and 
his cousin. 
The passengers they varied from a prince down to a 
clown, 
Who said, to keep our spirits up by letting spirits down. 
So, hurrah for, etc. 
On the nineteenth of March near the bridge there sat a 
group 
Listening to the songs and jokes of seine one of a 
circus 
troupe, 
When the chief officer, Mr. McKay, he acted very kind ; 
He told. the sailor rig some canvas to save us from the 
wind. 
So hurrah for, etc. 
Now we ail felt nice and warm, for the funnel it was hot, 
And Patterson amused us with his old coffee Pot ; 
But when he played an Irish jig with their feet they 
would keep time. 
Sure you'd think it was a 
pic-nic on the Cunard line. 
So, hurrah for, etc. 
Now I'll give advice to all my friends who think of leav-

To travel by the Cunard line whene'er they wish to roam. 
For safety and civility I'm sure they take the shine. 
Oh, there's no boats half so jolly as the Canard line.

Dedicated to ROBERT STICKNET, Esq. 
COME all ye lovers, young and old, and listen to my song, 
For 
relate and truly state the cause of all that's wrong. 
Ere I 
did roam I 
loved at home a 
girl named Molly, Oh ! 
But now she's gone and left me in a 
state of grief and 
woe. 
CITORTJS. 
I'm travelling round the country, and I'm searching high 
and low ; 
But she's gone to Cincinnati, in the State of Oho-ho. 
Last week I 
went to Brooklyn to see some boys from 
Clare. 
I 
saw Michael Ryan, Pat O'Brien, and a 
boy named Mar-
tin Hare. 
They said that Molly went out West, but the place they 
do not know, 
Still they think it's Cincinnati, in the State of Oho-ho. 
Your American country is so large, where to go I 
do not 
kuio w 
And look for Cincinnati, or its State of Oho-ho. 
Now, if I 
don't find. my Molly dear, I'll tell you what I'll 
: 
I'll go to Salt Lake City—'tisn't one I'll have, but two— 
And if ever Molly finds me out, I'll have her for to know 
She may go to Cincinnati, in the State of Oho-ho.

ACUSHL A MACHREB. 
By JOHNNY PATTERSON. 
Ant.---" Dear Irish Boy." 
On, Erin, my country, though thousands now leave thee, 
With suffering provocations that no tongue can tell, 
To see the pride of my country depart so does grieve me, 
And their sighs fill the sails as they bid thee farewell. 
Your foes they are smiling, whilst wealth they are piling, 
Our sons for them toiling by land and by sea. 
Oh, land of great plenty, there's your barns and stores 
empty ! 
Oh, Ireland ! wronged Ireland! Acushla machree! 
All, why is my country thus standing in danger 
You rulers of Ireland can best understand. 
'Tis because all our strongholds are held by the stranger— 
Our castles, our cattle. our homes, and our land, 
Whilst my country is dwindling far from its proud station, 
That once was the home for the brave and the free. 
Now the pride of my people must seek emigration 
Far away from poor Ireland, acushla machree ! 
Now Britannia may boast of her army and navy, 
And her conquests abroad, which she ne'er fought 
alone, 
But if a 
war should break out, and she required a 
new 
levy, 
Then she'd need those brave boys she has driven from 
home. 
For Irishmen—ever in battle none braver— 
They fight like the tiger by land and by sea, 
And in all her late quarrels we have shared her great 
laurels. 
Faugh-a-balaugh for Ireland! Acushla machree. 
OLD IRELAND IS THE COUNTRY I WAS 
BORN IN. 
By JOHNNY PATTERSON. 
On, I 
have just left Donegal, and I 
thought I'd give a 
call— 
It is a 
thing that becomes an honest neighbor— 
For I 
am going to cross the say, bound for America, 
'Where I 
am tould a 
man is paid for his labor. 
It is there I'll see, Ochone ! the boys I 
knew at home— 
Oh, the boys I 
often drank with until morning ; 
But wherever I 
may go, sure I'll have you all to know 
That old Ireland is the country I 
was born in. 
CHORUS. 
So now strike up your band in praise of Paddy's land, 
Although I 
am going to it in the morning ; 
But wherever I 
may roam, sure I'll always think of home, 
For old Ireland is the country I 
was born in. 
Ah, then, many a 
weary mile I 
have walked in Erin's Isle, 
And many are the hardships I 
have seen sure. 
I 
have seen both young and old starving in the cold, 
When hurled by the landlord from the door ; 
But now those days have past, and I 
hope I've seen the 
last. 
May the wrongs of my country soon be righted, 
Then the world soon would see Ireland proud and free, 
If her sons would only be united. 
So now strike, etc. 
So now I'll say good-bye„ for the time is drawing nigh, 
And the steamer she leaves Queenstown to-morrow ; 
Troth, my luggage it is light, and my purse not very bright, 
But my heart is well loaded down with sorrow. 
So farewell, poor Granuail; from you I 
now must sail, 
As thousands of my people done before me; 
But if I 
could live at home, sure from there I'd never roam. 
I 
can't, boys, and where's the man can blame me ? 
So now strike, etc.

'TIS LUCKY SOMETIMES TO BE LATE. 
Written and sung by JOHNNY PATTERSON. 
SOME people are oft in a 
hurry, 
Without knowing what they're going to do, 
And oft, through their bustle and flurry, 
Their business transactions they rue ; 
My advice is, take things nice and easy, 
Don't let excitement baffle your fate, 
Many people may think that I'm crazy 
When I 
say it's lucky at times to be late. 
CHORUS. 
Slow and sure is my motto through life, boys, 
Though some don't approve of my gait, 
But you'll find what I 
say is quite right, boys, 
'Tis lucky sometimes to be late. 
Now I 
once on a 
journey was going, 
By rail, a 
number of miles, 
But from morning till night there's no knowing 
What misfortune may add to man's trials ; 
I 
was late, the train had a 
collision, 
Oh, sad was the passengers' fate, 
Now see, by fortune's bright vision, 
'Twas lucky that time I 
was late. 
Slow and sure, etc. 
Once I 
was going to be married, 
But the bride took another in spite, 
And glad I 
am now that I 
tarried, 
For she walloped him that very night ; 
And if he dare say that he's master • 
She tears all the hair off his pate ; 
I'd have had her, but he was much faster— 
I 
missed her, and glad I 
was late. 
Slow and sure, etc. 
Another night, when I 
knocked at my lodgings, 
From the window a 
voice said ' Begone ;" 
It was my landlord, disagreeable mild Hodgins, 
Who says, " I 
won't let you in after one ;" 
I 
turned and walked to the circus, 
And in the ;stables I 
slept safe and sound; 
In the morn, when I 
called at my lodgings, 
I 
found the house burned to the ground. 
Slow and sure, eta.

I 
TOOK my girl one day, 
A 
sailing down the bay, 
And Emma was the darling creature's name. 
While standing on the pier, 
Some chaps at her did stare; 
And one and all around her did exclaim: 
CHORUS. 
Oh! Emma, whoa Emma, 
Emma, you put me in quite a 
dilemma, 
Oh! Emma, whoa Emma, 
That's what I 
hear wherever I 
go 
I 
ask'd them what they meant ? 
When some one at me sent 
An egg, which nearly struck me in the eye. 
Emma began to scream ! 
" 
Oh, Fred, what does this mean ?" 
I 
ask'd again, and this was their reply— 
Oh ! Emma, etc. 
I 
thought they'd never cease, 
So shouted out " Police !" 
And when he came he looled at me so sly. 
The crowd then at me laugh'd, 
And said I 
must be " daft ;" 
And once again they all commene'd to cry— 
Oh! Emma, etc. 
An old man said to me, 
" 
Why, young man, can't you see 
The joke ?" and I 
look'd at him with surprise 
He said, " don't be put out, 
It's a 
saying's got about ;" 
And then their voices seem'd to rend the skies, 
Oh! Emma, eta 
HURRAH FOR A RACE OR A FAIR. 
Written and sung by JOHNNY PATTLRON. 
! 
from Ennis to Limerick one day 
With some neighboring boys I 
did go, sirs, 
It was race time I 
heard people say, 
And a 
pleasanter time I 
don't know, sirs ; 
They came down from Cork and Kildare, 
From Kerry and sweet Tipperary, 
The Waterford boys they were there, 
And each heart was as light as a 
fairy. 
CHORUS. 
Then hurrah for a 
race or a 
fair, 
Where the boys are all jolly and frisky ; 
Sure you'll ne'er see that blackguard dull care, 
Where there's colleens and plenty of whiskey. 
In those days it was horses, not steam, 
That took you so nate and so cosy, 
By your side sat your own sweet colleen, 
And her cheeks they looked blooming and rosy ; 
In the front sat the driver in state, 
With his whip flying away with the wind, sirs; 
And to save his poor horses the weight, 
Tile gossoons he would knock down behind, sirs. 
Then hurrah, etc. 
On the course there was tents, boys, galore, 
There was dancing and plenty of singing ; 
The pipes were playing " Rory O'More," 
While the bell for the start it was ringing ; 
" 
They're off ! they're off !" was the cry ; 
Sure it was true what the people were saying, 
For two jockeys on the ground I 
did spy, 
And if there were three, two to one would be laying. 
Then hurrah, etc. 
THE IRISH FAIR. 
Written by W. I. W HITBREAD, and originally sung by J. II . 
CONROY. 
As I 
rose up one morning, 
The same day as the Fair, 
All the pretty boys and girls, 
They assembled there. 
There was humped- back McCarty, 
And cork-legged Teddy Lee, 
They were among the party, 
Who rode along with me. 
CHORUS. 
While on the road to the Fair, 
Tascha shin ga miska, 
Arrah, what fun was there, 
Falga Balga Lorrah. 
Now we're off to Donnybrook, 
For to see the Fair; 
Won't we have a 
jolly time, 
With the boys and girls there! 
We'll dance and sing, and whiskey drink, 
Till our hearts are free irom care 
There's no such fun, where'er you go, 
As you'll find at an Irish Fair. 
We all went into a 
tavern, 
And there began to sing, 
And Judy O'Brien and Mickey Flinn, 
They done a 
double fling. 
And then they got a-fighting, 
You couldn't hold them back, 
Teddy off with his cork-leg, 
McCarty's head he cracked. 
While on the, eta 
On the road while driving, 
The crowd sung songs so sweet, 
And big fat Lizzie McCarty, 
Shure she broke down the seat. 
They all fell out of the wagon, 
The horse he gave a

I 
split my sides a-laughing, 
At McCarty on his hump.

She was just the sort of creature that Nature did intend 
To walk straight through the world without the Grecian bend, 
Nor did she wear a 
chignon- 1'd have you till to know 
That I 
met her in the garden where the praties grow. 
She was singing an ould Irish song, called " Gm a 
gal ma-
chree," 
Oh, says I, what a 
wife she'd make for an Irish boy like me ; 
I 
was on important business. hut I 
did not like to go 
And leave the girl or the garden where the 'males grow. 
She was just, etc.

Says I, " My lovely darling. I'm tired of single life, 
And if you have no objection 
make you my dear wife ;" 
Says she, " ill ax my parents, and to-morrow I'll let you 
know, 
If you meet me in the garden where the praties grow." 
She was just, etc. 
Now her parents they consented, and we're blessed with chil-
dren three— 
Two girls like their mammy, and a 
boy the image of me; 
I'll train up the children in the way they should go,

EMIGRANTS. 
Written and sung by J. PATTEREON. Music composed by R. 
LAWRENCE. 
Now, here I 
am, a 
Munster boy, from Ennis all the way, 
To live by labor I 
did try, though I 
got but little pay; 
Provisions high and wages small, I 
couldn't myself main-
tain, 
And to earn an honest living I 
was forced to cross the 
main. 
CHORUS. 
So I 
parted from the shore I 
might never see no more— 
Ould Ireland you're my darling, and I'll always you adore, 
Sure the music of your harp with joy recalls the heart 
Back to the green land of Erin. 
Now, the reason why we are so poor I'll quickly tell to 
you— 
Hardships, sure, we must endure, if we have no work to 
do, 
Though the land is rich and fertile, as you've heard in 
many a 
song; 
But if you'll listen for a 
while I'll point you out what's 
wrong. 
So 1' parted, etc. 
Now, if our Irish landlords, who in foreign lands do roam, 
Would spend a 
little time and money in the land they 
call their own, 
I'm sure there's room on each estate for a 
fuundry or a 
mill, 
To give labor to those Irish boys who otl..kr countries

Then hurrah, my boys, for fun and noise, 
I'm the boy that fears no danger ; 
My purse is light, but my heart is right. 
I'm Jack the Connaught Ranger. 
Shure I'm in love with a 
fair colleen, 
And her name is Mary Ryan; 
Together we dance upon the green, 
Oh ! about her, faith I'm dying. 
There's lovers comes about her smart, 
Like asses round a 
manger ; 
But there's not one can melt her heart 
Like Jack the Connaught Ranger. 
Then hurrah, etc. 
Good night, my friends, I 
must away, 
I 
must, upon my honor, 
For I've promised to have a 
cup of tea 
Along with Judy O'Connor ; 
And if I 
call some other night, 
Don't think that I'm a

For to please you all ' tis my delight,

MANY CAN HELP ONE. 
As sung by TONY PASTOR. 
SomE very good sayings I've heard in my time, 
And some I 
believe to be true; 
The one I 
will mention to-night in my song 
Is one that is well known to you ; 
If you meet a 
man who is down in the world, 
And assistance you can't give him any, 
Remember that many can always help one, 
Where one cannot always help many. 
CHORUS. 
Then give what you can to those in distress, 
Let it be a 
dime or a 
penny, 
For many can help one, I've heard people say, 
Where one cannot always help many. 
How often a 
trifle would save a 
man's life 
When he is near dying from want ; 
He's tried to live honest all through his lifetime, 
But finds in the end that he can't ; 
At last he is tempted to steal or to starve, • 
His rich friends they all pass him by, 
They heed not his wishes, they care not his wants, 
He's left like a 
dog there to die. 
Then give what you can, etc. 
A 
man may be wealthy one end of the year, 
The next one be wretched and poor ; 
struggled his hardest to keep himself up, 
But has sunk down to poverty's (ioor ; 
Such men as these deserve your support, 
So give it to them who most need, 
For those Avho've experienced poverty know 
'Tis a 
very hard battle indeed. 
Then give what you can, etc. 
I 
hope what I've mentioned to-night in my song, 
That nothing I've said out of place ; 
A 
man may be poor, but still honest be. 
For poverty, ' tis no disgrace ; 
Then give what you can with a 
generous heart, 
No knowing when the tide it may turn ; 
Just give him a 
chance to rise up in the -world, 
And your kindness he's sure to return. 
Then give what you can, etc.

Why are those tears on thy cheek ? 
Give me the answer I

Speak to me, love, only speak. 
Why are you sorrowing here, love, 
-When I 
am close by your side ? 
Swiftly the day draweth near, love, 
Soon I 
shall claim you my bride. 
What have I 
done to deceive thee ? 
This is the answer I 
setk, 
What were the words that could grieve thee ? 
Speak to me, love, only speak, oh. 
Speak to me then, etc. 
Hearts like your own cannot live, love, 
Always in sorrow and pain ; 
WhiTer you gladly forgive, love, 
Kiss and be happy again. 
Cease all thy weary repining, 
Banish the tears from thy cheek ; 
With my arms round you entwining, 
Speak to me, love, only speak, oh. 
Speak to me then, etc.

On, how soon we are forgotten 
In this busy world Of ours, 
Though we often strew the pathway 
Of our friends with choicest flowers ; 
Ev'ry loving deed and action 
Is remembered but a 
while, 
And the thanks are oft as heartless 
As a 
flirting maiden's smile. 
CHORUS. 
Tho' we often strew the pathway 
Of our friends with choicest flow'rs 
We are very soon forgotten 
in this thankless world of ours. 
Oh, how soon we are forgotten 
In the paths of daily life, 
Though we aid our lame companions, 
Who are plunged in deepest strife ; 
Ev'ry tender word that's spoken 
To a 
friend in sad despair 
has a 
meaning seldom relished 
In this bustling world of care. 
Thu' we often, etc. 
Oh, how soon we are forgotten 
When the form is cold and still. 
Though we've help'd the poor and needy 
To ascend life's rug-cred hill ; 
Some, perhaps,. will have a 
sorrow 
When the Reaper calls us in ; 
But alas, ' tis soon forgotten 
In this thankless world of sin.

Ir we must part, yes, you and I, 
Though tears may come to dim the eye, 
Though hearts are sad and lips may sigh, 
Don't say " Good-bye," don't say " Good-bye !" 
We'll breathe a 
sweeter, softer strain, 
A 
word to give the heart less pain; 
We'll say " Adieu," yes, you and I— 
" 
Adieu," Sweetheart, but not " Good-bye !" 
Well say " Adieu," yes, you and I—

Adieu," Sweetheart, but not " Good-bye 
" 
Good-bye " may do for lips more cold, 
Or hearts whose love was never told, 
Whose visions bright, and hopes are high— 
For them the cold, cold word " Good-bye !" 
But love like ours, so seldom known, 
Should have a 
language of its own 
Some word to cheer the parting sigh : 
" 
Adieu," Sweetheart, but not " Good-bye !" 
Some word to cheer the parting sigh:

" 
DORKINS WAS TIGHT." 
Written by BENJ. D. 
COLLINS. 
Sung by Gus W ILLIAms. 
THE theatre was full, and so were the actors, 
Dan Dorkins was going to appear . 
That night in a 
bare-footed slack- wire clog, 
For he was the Pompey round here. 
The bar-room was fearfully crowded with bec,is 
Who awaited a 
pleasant surprise ; 
For they knew they would cat 
When the lunch was set out, 
And they longed for the curtain to rise. 
The curtain arose, and so did the people, 
Who began to shout and hurrah ; 
Dan Dorkins came out with young Oliver Twist, 
But they gave him the laugh and yak ! yak 
The play it began when the curtain went up, 
But something was wrong I 
felt sure ; 
" 
He's away off his base," says John Jas. Mansfield, 
That hover went back on the poor. 
A brick—well it was—I 
saw Dorkins start, 
And carom on the dark red for two ; 
And it made me feel thirsty to see how he worked, 
But continually dropping his cue.-
He says, " fm the Aing," when a 
woman jumped up 
Cried, " yon lie, for you're one of the gang, 
And you owe me for washing." That knocked Dorkins 
cold, 
And hi,s head on his breast did hang. 
At length the footlights he approached with a 
rush, 
And " Ladies and gentlemen,'' said, 
If I 
haven't drank enough bourbon to-night, 
The fault is my wealth, not my head. 
Many a 
time I 
have made,- you all sick, 
And get up and go out for a 
beer ; 
When me and Jim -_-; tokes walked a 
mile in a 
week, 
How I 
wish Dan O'Leary was here. 
You insult me to-night and say I 
am sober, 
For years I've been a 
Hamlet alone ; 
I'll tell you the reason, I 
know you will treat, 
I've a 
mother-in-law dead—drunk at home."

Of dent years dat pased away, 
When (
ley tied me up in bondage long ago; 
in old Virftinny State, 
it was dar we separate, 
And it

Dey took away my boy, 
He was his mother's joy ; 
From a 
baby in de cradle we him raise; 
Oh, dey put us far apart, 
An' it briAe de ole man's heart, 
In dem agonizing, cruel slav'ry days, 
CHORUS. 
Dey never come again, 
Let us give our praise to Him 
Who looks down whar de little children play; 
So ev'ry night and morn, 
We will pray for dem dat's gone, 
In dem agonizing, cruel sia,v'ry days. 
Still my mem'ry will steal o'er 
To dat dear old cabin floor, 
When de shadow of de sun came peeping in; 
At night, when all was dark, 
We would hear de watch- dog bark, 
And we d 
listen to de murmur of de wind. 
It seem to say to me, 
" 
You people must be free," 
For de happy time am coming, Lord be prais'd! 
For then we would weep and moan, 
For our souls was not our own, 
In dem agonizing, cruel slav'ry days. 
Dey never, etc. 
I 
am very old and feeble, 
And our life am nearly done ; 
I 
have travell'd in the roughest kind of road ; 
Thro' sickness, toil and sorrow, 
I 
have reach'd de end at last, 
And I'm resting by de wayside :vid my load. 
Forc.,et now and foraive, 
has always been my guide, 
For &it's what de golden Scripture surely says; 
But our ment•ry will turn round,

For handkerchiefs they're waving towels to catch our soldiers' 
eyes '•  
They've left their hash to come out and wash when the mar-

Then we all raise our hats to the tune of the Branigan's Band; 
Oh ! don't their hearts go pit- a-pat, 
As each one lifts his hat, the lean as well as fat, 
Says, there's my Dan, there goes my Pat, 
He's the Daisy swell that's with the famous Brpnig,an's Band.

Oh, we had a 
ball in Emerald Hall, and an illegant cypner, too; 
There was beans and peas and frigazees, and oysters tat for you, 
With pickled stews, and Itullaboloos, and Irish quail so oyand ; 
Beets, and cheese, and some potheen for the boys of the Brazil-
gan's Band. 
Oh it's then we snng,, and danc'd a

And oh ! how good we feel, we make the ladies squeal, 
So when morning comes it's home we steal, 
With the boys all drunk as lords, with the Branigan's Band.

And if my pets of the wood and dell

Where robed in yellow and crimson leaves, 
'Twas near the last of the russet fall, 
The men were binding the golden sheaves.

GENTLY touch the keys, my darling, 
Sing to me those songs of old, 
In them there is charming mosic, 
Notes of silver and of gold; 
Ev'ry word, so pure and simple, 
Shadows of the past will bring, 
And I 
wander back to childhood 
When those dear old songs you sing. 
CHORUS. 
Gently touch the keys, my darling, 
Sing to me those songs of old, 
In them there is charming music, 
Notes of silver and of gold. 
Often in the lane and meadow, 
And the woodland, long ago, 
I 
have help'd to swell the chorus— 
Sing the songs that please me so; 
In their melody bewitching, 
There's a 
fascinating ring, 
Aild my heart is all enraptured 
With the songs we used to sing. 
Gently touch, etc. 
Sing the songs of old, my darling, 
Breathe the verses soft and low, 
Sound the key note gently, darling, 
Let the music lightly flow ; 
Tho' the pages now are musty, 
They are just as dear to me, 
And I 
often scan them over 
For some old familiar glee.

Now there's no one left to love me, 
Friends of old have pass'd away; 
Some are glad in lands above me, 
' Where my fancy loves to stray; 
Some in distant homes are dwelling, 
Born a 
joyous life to know, 
While I 
live so sad and lonely, 
With my dreams of long ago. 
CIIORUS. 
Sweet long ago, sweet long ago, 
Life now no pleasure can bestow; 
Pure and bright in lands above me, 
Live my friends of long ago. 
Oft a 
friendly smile may greet me, 
But its pleasure soon is fled; 
Angel smiles in slumber meet me, 
When I'm dreaming of the dead.' 
Days are dark with clouds of sorrow, 
Hope is dead within my breast; 
Joy to-day, and pain to-morrow, 
, Till there comes eternal rest. 
Sweet long ago, etc.

HER cheeks are as red as the roses, 
Her eyes have a 
violet hue, 
Her teeth they are whiter than lilies, 
They sparkle with crystals of dew ; 
Her lips they are tinted with ruby, 
Her hair is of buttercup gold, 
Her form is an object of beauty, 
A Venus so perfect in mould. 
CHORUS . 
Her cheeks are as red as the roses 
That blossom in meadows or bowers; 
Her teeth they are whiter than lilies, 
Her face is a 
garden of flowers. 
The blush of the pink on her forehead, 
The bright yellow shade of her hair, 
The soft velvet touch of her shoulders, 
Are charms that are handsome and fair; 
Her voice is as sweet as an angel's, 
IIer smile is a 
welcome to me, 
Her glances are truly bewitching, 
She's pretty as pretty can be. 
Her cheeks are, etc. 
She's up with the birds in the morning, 
She's cheerful and happy all day, 
She never lets anguish approach her, 
But drives grief and sorrow away; 
She is a 
delightful companion, 
She makes the days shorter than hours, 
Oh, she is a 
darling, a 
dewdrop, 
Her face is a 
garden of flowers.

MY 
love is the belle of the Avenue, 
She walks up and down ev'ry day, 
And charms ey'ry one as she passes by, 
So beau'iful, graceful, and gay ; 
The swells when they see her go crazy, 
And silently wish they were free 
To walk by her side, but they are denied, 
For she will have no one but me. ( Oh !) 
CHORUS . 
She is the belle of the Avenue, 
Graceful and bright, full of fairy light, 
Sweet and enchanting with eyes of blue, 
Beaming with love and glee; 
She it4 the star of soc'ety, 
Pride of the ball with her fairy form, 
Joy and delight of her home so bright, 
And dearer than life to me. 
Sometimes when it's fine in the afternoon 
Her ma sends her out for a 
walk; 
"Now, darling," shell say, " don't be long away, 
Don't stand with the young men to talk ;" 
" 
0, ma," she replies, " do not fear me— 
You know such a 
thing cannot be ;" 
Then smiling she goes in all her nice clothes, 
And waits on the corner for me. ( Ha ! ha!) 
She is the belle, etc. 
We walk and we talk of the latest balls, 
And view all the styles of the day, 
And when she must leave, oh! you can't conceive 
how much I 
would wish her to stay ; 
But she will return on the morrow, 
That is, if mamma will agree, 
And while we're apart I 
know in my heart 
She's all the time wishing for me. ( Ah !) 
She is the belle, etc.

Or give a

But left rue standing at the gate

The arbor near the gate, 
Had said " good- night " an hour before 
Unto his loving mate; 
But he was cold and obstinate. 
His heart was out of place, 
He would not hold me to his breast, 
Or look me in the face. 
He would not, etc.

Without a

Sweet and precious little rose,

THEY ALT , DO IT. 
As sung by To: 
PASTOR. 
SOME folks will cry, " Oh, shame, Mr4 IJones, you are to 
blame; 
I 
never should have thought it, sir, of you ;" 
While if they'd look at home, before abroad they'd roam, 
I'm positive they'd have enough to do. 
Mr. Brown says it's a 
sin that Mr. Smith drinks gin, 
And harbors all the gang from day to day; 
When Mr. Green was caught doing what he didn't ought, 
When he in self-defence was heard to say— 
CHORUS. 
They all do it, they all do it, 
They all do it, though oft-times they rue it ; 
Yet they all do it, they all do it, 
And so it will continue to the end of the world. 
For hours three or four lovers spooning at the door 
On any pleasant morning may be seen; 
And if they have a 
kiss ' twill never come amiss, 
And they enjoy it, though they say they didn't mean ; 
When creeping down the stairs comes the old man un-
awares, 
And kissing catches the couple iii the act, 
The mother from above says, " Don't interfere, my love, 
You can't dispute this most important fact—" 
They all do it, etc. 
Old women do declare girls should never dye their hair, 
And then again they say it's very nice, 
Without the least restraint, their faces so to paint, 
And rob the cats and dogs of all their mice; 
U)

TWRY ALL DO IT.—Concluded. 
Each girl a 
little " puff " has inside a 
seal-skin muff, 
They are never seen without it, night or day; 
And her " turnup " nose she'll powder, if a 
moment is 
allowed her, 
When, if you laugh, she'll innocently say— 
They all do it, etc. 
But what does most impress is the style in which they 
dress; 
It's enough to make you laugh when them you see ; 
They've a 
hat upon their heads large enough to make up 
beds 
For " pussy " cats with kittens two or three; 
In their paniers too behind, if examined, you will find 
The most important papers of the day ; 
The " Clipper," if you chose, the " Herald," and the 
" 
News," 
Or anything that chance puts in their way. 
They all do it, etc. 
There's my neighbor, Mrs. West, who's expensive in her 
dress, 
And her husband only gets nine dollars every week; 
I've often heard him say, " If things go on this way, 
We'll a 
lodging in the station have to seek, 
For the doctor and the nurse will drain my scanty purse, 
With many more expenses to defray; 
Then he gets into a 
passion when they tell him it's the 
fashion, 
And they soothe him when they sing this truthful lay— 
For they all do it, etc.

THE prettiest maiden that ever I 
knew 
Was sweet little Etta Estelle, 
Her hair it was tied in a 
ribbon of blue 
Whenever we met in the dell; 
Her cheeks were as a 
red as the roses of June, 
And brown were her tresses of hair, 
Her face was as bright as the sunlight at noon, 
And she was bewitchingly fair. 
CHORUS. 
The prettiest maiden that ever I 
knew 
Was one that I 
met in the dell, 
Her hair it was tied in a 
ribbon of blue, 
Her name was sweet Etta Estelle. 
The daintiest darling, the sweetest of all 
Was dear little Etta Estelle ; 
Her step was as light as the leaflets that fall, 
And she was considered the belle; 
Her voice was as soft as an angel's could be, 
And fond was the glance of her eyes; 
Her heart was so honest, so happy and free 
I 
thought her the best ' neath the skies. 
The prettiest maiden, etc. 
The saintliest maiden that ever I 
knew 
Was fond little Etta Estelle, 
And down where the daisies are sprinkled with dew 
They've laid her to rest in the dell ; 
Above her the robin is singing its lay, 
And round her the buttercups bloom, 
Oh, could I 
but see that sweet angel to-day 
And bring her to life from the tomb. 
The prettiest maiden, etc. 
DANNY, GO AFTER YOUR FATHER. 
Sung with great success by JAMES BRADLEY. 
Pist Mrs. O'Malley, Roger's wife, 
lie is very fond of drink; 
From Monday morning till Saturday night 
Of nothing else he'll think, 
But go down to the corner store, 
Throw dice and play the cards; 
Instead of bringing his money home, 
He spends it on all the blackguards. 
CHORUS. 
Danny, go after your father, 
He is down in the corner store, 
Playing forty-fives with the Dutchman— 
Against it he often swore ; 
Tell him come home to his supper, 
I 
know it will save his life ; 
So that's a 
good lad, 
Go after your dad, 
And tell him come home to his wife. 
Sometimes he takes the pledge, my boys, 
And he keeps it for a 
week, 
Until Saturday night comes over his head, 
To the Dutchman's down he'll sneak ; 
He makes believe he is going for coal, 
And through the side door he'll steal, 
lie calls out to the bartender, 
Give me a 
big mug of ale! 
Danny, go after, etc. 
Now, dear friends, he's keeping straight, 
And be never leaves the house; 
He sits clown by the fire 
And reads his book, just like any mouse; 
I1ell you we are happy, 
Around the house there's peace; 
But I 
understand there's an alderman 
Going to put him upon the police. 
Danny, go after, etc.

Little bud of loveliness, 
Give your mamma one caress, 
Put your arms around me tight, 
Kiss me just once more to night ; 
All the day you've roarn'd about, 
Cheering with your joyful shout, 
Now your daily toil is done, 
You are weary, little one. 
Little bud of loveliness

Put your arms around me tight,

When you donned your baby clothes, 
You have prattled all the hours, 
Fairest bud of all the flow'rs.

He knows naught of trouble and care.

I NEVER SAW A SAW THAT SAWS AS THIS 
SAW SAWS. 
I'm Cheap Jack by trade, and all things I 
have sold, 
Low-priced, and expensive, and novel, and old, 
I've journeyed o'er the Prairies, Rocky Mountains and Vales, 
An , startled the natives with marvelous tales. 
But to-night I've an article I 
want to sell, 
That will suit anyone, I 
can warrant it well, 
This saw I 
can introduce safely, because 
I 
ne'er saw a 
SUNV saw like this ere saw saws. 
You may have sought a 
saw that saws like this saw saws, 
Or want a 
sort of saw that saws like this saw saws; 
You purchase ought a 
saw that saws like this saw saws, 
But you never saw a 
saw that saws like this saw saws. 
Its uses I'll run through remarkably quick: 
it can cut its own lucky and cut its own stick, 
To cut along quickly it never has 
And goes faster than ever a 
cutter yet sailed. 
It's assisted full many old fogies when ill, 
To cut off their heir—I 
mean in a 
will— 
It can cut in the light and can cut in the dark, 
And has caused full many a 
cutting remark. 
You may have sought a 
saw, etc. 
Non- this very saw—mind, it's truth that I 
tell— 
Assisted in cutting the Suez Canal, 
And it's used, you always distinctly can trace, 
In taking a 
short cut to any known place. 
It's used in cutting a 
dozen things more. " 
it can cut an acquaintance, a 
dun, or a 
bore. 
And as falsehood my spirit is mnchly beneath, 
I 
assure you it's true it can cut its own teeth. 
You may have sought a 
saw, eta 
Mind, what I 
now tell you is not a 
joke, 
'Twill assist you to long cut or short, if you smoke, 
And tho' I've not tried, I 
believe these two facts, 
it's useful to cut down a 
rate or a 
tax. 
I 
never saw a 
saw saw like this saw saws, no! 
Will ally one purchase it now, eve I 
go ? 
For, tho' at the fact perhaps many may scoff, 
This saw is compelling me now to cut off. 
You may have sought a 
saw that saws like this saw saws, 
or want a 
sort of saw that saws like this saw saws; , 
You purchase ought a 
saw that saws like this saw saws, 
But you never saw a 
saw that saws like this saw saws.

I 
FELL in love with a 
damsel sweet, 
And thou9,
,ht she was in love with me; 
I 
knelt in worship before her feet, 
All dressed in my Sunday clothes! 
She heard me thro' and then she grew 
Sympathetic and sad, said ' twas really too bad! 
" 
You know, " she said " I'm a 
friend to you, 
But you must not thus propose." 
CHORUS. 
Oh ! no, don't ask me I 
pray, 
I'm sorry, indeed, 
Believe what I 
say; 
Oh ! dear, now, please go away, 
You're rather too " heavy" for me 
I 
still kept on and I 
hoped to see 
A change take place in her angel face, 
But she was ever the same to me, 
And I 
was her slave the while. 
At last I 
saw her walking out 
With another young man, then between them I 
ran, 
But lie turned about, and gave an awful shout, 
While in vain I 
tried to smile. 
SPOKEN.—Yes, and I 
trembled a 
little too when he said: 
" 
What's the matter with you, young fellow 
Don't you make 
any common error." 
All I 
could say, was— 
Oh! no, don't, etc. 
Down town I 
met with a 
friend one night, 
For pleasure bound, we were all round ; 
Says I, " I 
wish for a 
loan so slight, 
A 
ten dollar bill will do ! " 
IIe looked at me and smiled so queer 
While he vow'el his regret, said he had none " to let ;" 
" 
Do you take me, sir, for a 
Fusileer ? 
I 
must beg to be free from you l" 
Oh! no, don't, etc. 
One night I 
went to a 
dazzling ball, 
In the mazy whirl, with a 
lovely girl, 
I 
thought this pleasure the best of all, 
With music around my ears.

RATHER TOO "HEAVY " FOR AM.—Concluded. 
When came the time, we went to sup, 
There was bright sparkling wine, and the table was fine,

While I 
look'd I 
was fill'd with fears 
SPOKEN.—She had the most astonishing appetite of any girl 
I 
ever saw; and you should see how gracefully she drank off 
her champagne! 
Very charming indeed. 
I 
called on her a 
few days afterwards, and she wanted to know when we would 
go to another ball. 
All I 
said in reply was— 
Oh! ro, don't, etc.

The solemn word " farewell."

And soon or late we'll say farewell 
To some sweet fading flower.

FEVER, 
Beware the first approaches of this stealthy foe, that cometh 
like a 
thief in the night. 
A change of drinking- water, unripe 
fruit, a 
debauch, a 
slight cold may be the first clutch of Fever. 
It can be guarded against and repelled by a 
timely use of 
Merlin's Health Granules. A person should never' 
travel to the mountains, to the sea- shore, or on the ocean with-
out a 
supply. 
Doctors admit this fact, and they don't speak 
well of any medicine unless its merits are very great. 
DYSPEPSIA, the arch- fiend of misery and decay, can 
be cured effectually by a 
persistent use of Merlin's Health 
Granules. Why l Because these Granules go to the 
very root of the complaint. 
They not only drive out -the fecu-
lent matter that clogs the avenues of the body, but, they in-
vigorate and give tone to the digestive apparatus, and make 
healthful blood flow through every petty artery ; then comes 
a 
good appetite, and good food insures a 
lasting cure. 
in the Cholera Years it was found that the first 
thing needed was to drive out of the stomach and bowels the 
noxious germs of the destroyer. 
Nothing is so effeetual for 
this purpose as Merlin's Health Granules, for while 
they are very powerful for good they are harmless for evil. 
A child may take them in moderation, while they can be 
made to operate upon the strongest man. 
" I 
DON'T KNOW WHAT MIA ME!" 
How often do we hear this remark. A man or woman grows 
weak, feeble, irresolute. 
As Hamlet says, " Man delights not 
me, nor woman either." 
This feeling arises from many causes. 
Lack of exercise, loss of appetite, deep grief—all these tend to 
render the fluids of the body heavy, thick, sluggish. 
There' 
was a 
health- lesson taught by the angel stirring the pool be-
fore the sick got any benefit from its waters. 
It needed action, 
vitalizing with pure air. 
This is precisely the effect produced 
by Merl 
heti Health Granules. The sluices are cleaned, 
and the nutriment finds its way where it is wanted and can do 
most good.

M ERLIN'S HEALTH GRANULES cure Biliousness, 
Congestion of the Liver, Cerebral Congestion and Giddi-
ness. 
They arouse the sluggish currents of the blood, 
and awake to healthy and harmonious action every 
function of the body; they render clear and bright the 
sallow skin and lack-lustre eye, renovating and renewing 
the entire system, removing and averting the many 
diseases which the disordered liver provokes and 
produces. 
In malarial districts, where biliousness is 
most prevalent and most to be dreaded, "M ERLIN'S 
HEALTH GRANULES" will prove a 
great saving of 
health and money, as their timely use will avert attacks 
of Bilious Fever and Malarial Fever, and will so fortify 
the system that it will be unaffected by malarial 
influence.

MALARIAL FEVER. 
However doctors may differ as to the exact cause of this 
fearful disease, they all agree upon one thing, that poisonous 
atoms have found their way into the system. 
Common sense 
tells us that the way to cure this disease is to expel these 
poisonous atoms. 
This is effectually done by a 
free use of 
Merlin's Health Granules. Not only do they cleanse 
the bowels of the perilous stuff that to retain is fatal, but they 
restore the blood to activity, and make it pay frequent visits to 
the lungs, where it becomes aerated and full of health. This is 
purifying at the fountain head. 
Where the source is clean the 
stream cannot be foul 
Good health and chills and fever of 
course cannot exist together. 
THE GOUT CAN BE RELIEVED, 
if not entirely banished from the system, by using Merlin's 
Health Granules at the first intimation of an approach-
ing attack. 
The Granules prevent the formation of the 
chalky deposits which, if allowed to become at all fixed, ren-
der the joints stiff, and make them work with difficulty. 
The 
Granules have exactly the same effect upon the joints that 
grease has upon axles and wheels—lubricates the grating 
parts, then the joints work smooth and easy and without any 
pain. 
Try Merlin's Health Granules occasionally if 
you want to bid defiance to that old hereditary foe, the Gout. 
"WAKEFULNESS AND SOMNAMBULISM ; 
though so different in many of their features, are children of 
the same parents—Indigestion and Torpidity of Blood. 
Both 
of these complaints can be cured in the same way, simply by 
producing a 
healthy, natural digestion. 
It is no use trying 
local remedies. 
You may swathe and bathe and bandage the 
head till you are tired. 
It will not alter the condition of the 
blood. 
You might as well expect to make a 
house healthy by 
whitewashing the outside and cleaning the windows while the 
cellar was reeking with sewer gas. No! the blood must be puri-
fied, or disease will ride rampant. 
Use Merlin's Health 
Granules and Wakefulness will subside into calm slumber, 
and the open-eyed sleep-walker will remain with his eyes closed 
upon the unruffled pillow.

DON'T WAIT TILL TO- MORROW 
If you feel any symptoms of Jaundice or other complaints be-
ginning in a 
non- acting Liver. 
The bile is 
topped, and not 
doing its duty. 
Soon follow torpidity, congestion, mor-
tification, DEATH. Take at once a 
full dose of Mer-
lin's Health: Granules. That will stop the disease. 
NERVOUS DEBILITY 
is the curse of civilization. 
Luckily it can be cured. 
It pro-
ceeds from intense mental strain ; from violating physical laws, 
throwing the reins on the neck of Passion. The body becomes 
impaired, the mind follows suit, then the weak body and the 
irresolute mind plague each other, and drive the poor wretch 
to mental imbecility ; but, as we have said, Nervous Debility 
can be cured ; the diseased humors can be driven from the 
blood ; the stomach becomes strong and active, the heart 
bounds to its work, the mind follows suit, black despair flies, 
health returns, not by any miracle, but simply by using the 
great remedy, Merlin's Health Granules. 
One box 
has been known to bring a 
poor wretch from the edge of the 
grave. 
Do your bones ache 7 You are either filled with Malarial 
Poison or there lingers in your system the dire effects of an-
cestral indiscretions and the Mercurial Poisons never driven 
out. 
But do not despair. 
By judiciously using the never-
failing remedy, Merlin's Health Granules, the poison-
ous atoms are expelled to give place to pure, strength- giving 
blood. 
THE PRESENT DAY 
is the time to try and get well. 
The ounce of prevention i3 
the thing. 
Don't wait till you have to get the pound of cure. 
Stop the first small leak. 
Don't wait till the ship is water-
logged. 
Disease is absolutely prevented by using Mer-
lin's Health Granules as a 
family medicine.

"COME AND LET US REASON TOGETHER." 
It has been well said that he that cannot reason is a 
fool; he 
that dare not reason is a 
slave ; he that will not reason is a 
bigot. 
We do not believe, good reader, that you belong to either of 
these three classes, and therefore address ourselves to you. 
You will have noticed that every Doctor, after feeling the 
pulse, looking at the tongue, and ascertaining the temperature 
of the body, pauses for a 
moment's thought. 
Then he quickly 
asks, " Are your bowels regular ? " 
This you will therefore 
notice is the very key-note by which he seeks to know 
whether you are healthy or diseased. 
By further questions in 
the same direction he learns the particular nature of the dis-
ease. 
But no odds how many different points he may wander 
to, he soon returns to the digestive organs. 
The disease may be most apparent in the lungs, the kidneys, 
the heart, the liver, the head; but it is always the bowels he 
treats as the salient point of disease that has to be first treated, 
hence the first medicine prescribed is a 
dose to act upon the 
organs of digestion. 
This is wisdom. 
The doctor knows that 
without thorough digestion half the food taken is 
worse than useless. 
As certain things strewn around become 
incorporated with the soil and nourish it (left in a 
compact 
heap they breed disease), so without an active digestion food is 
hurtful. 
These are truths that no sane man will attempt to 
gainsay. 
What is the remedy 7 Surely a 
medicine powerful 
enough to carry off all injurious matter, and at the same time 
having such balsamic qualities as will heal any inflammations 
that may have arisen in the lining of the different ducts. 
Now 
the very best thing that can be used to do what all doctors 
recommend is Merlin's Health Granules. Pleasant 
to take, easy in operation, and leaving lasting good effects after 
their use. 
This is homely, sound doctrine. 
Try, and be con-
vinced. 
Merlin's Health Granules do not compete 
with any other aperient medicine .; 
they simply extinguish 
them. 
The sun don't fight with a 
penny dip, it merely out-
shines it.
