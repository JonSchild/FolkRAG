Page 1 23E-A3 W. F. TEXAS CANYON Oh, I guess you've heard my story, It's a sunny southern song,
It is down in Mississippi Where I take the road that's wrong. 'Twas down in Mississippi Where I
murdered my first man. 'Twas there that ? Where justice took his stand. I rambled through the
country To a place in Tennessee. Two more man went down before me, Nearly cost me my liberty.
Well, I rambled 'round the country For I never could find rest, 'Til I went to Texas Canyon Away out
in the west. Well, again I started drinkin', And again I pulled my gun, And in a single moment, The
deadly work was done. Now, the sheriff was a woman, But she got the drop on me. I threw down my
guns and surrendered, Gave up my liberty. 2 Page 2 TEXAS CANYON Now, I'm back in Mississippi,
Right here in my home state. I'm [waitin'?] for my trial, But I do not dread my fate. For still the sun
is shining in my home state, I'm waitin' for my trial, But I do not dread my fate, For still the sun is
shining and the stars are bright and clear And my heart is not repentant ? For I do not dread my
fate. ? [??] pining but I do not give a care, But, young men, take my warning, Please take my last
advice, Don't start the game of life / wrong, For you're bound to pay the rice.
I learned it from the Kentuckians around Crandon, Wisconsin..
