When the Leaves Turn Red [Textual Transcription]
RECORD 1
B-1 “When the Leaves Turn Red,” a “kind of a Baptist jumper song, a shouting song” heard
in the Bahamas, sung by Wilbur Roberts, Riviera, Florida, January 16, 1940. Recorded by
Stetson Kennedy and Robert Cook.
WHEN THE LEAVES TURN RED
When the leaves turn red and fall, Even to the green leaves, They turn red and fall.
Everybody's got a hiding place, We poor sinners got none; Run along, run along, Down in
the valley to pray, Run along, run along, Down in the valley to pray.
Oh Mary, Oh Martha, Honor the lamb, Honor the dying lamb.
Give away Jordan, Give away Jordan, Got but one more river to cross.
When I looked way over in Jordan, And I see God's chariot a-coming, And I know it's
God's chariot by the running of the wheel, Red and white robes together, On that mighty
day, On that mighty day, When Jesus Christ was born.
