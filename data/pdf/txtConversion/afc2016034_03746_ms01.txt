Interview Log 
00:00:01 Introduction 
00:00:06 Job title is Scattered-site Housing Manager; she describes as Case Manager/Social Worker; 
00:00:24 A typical day might include: 
• screening folks who are homeless and working to get them housing, which is the 
main part of her job; 
• visiting the many locations where her clients live to assess their needs, provide 
referrals; 
• going to a lease violation meeting where she meets with property management and 
client to discuss concerns and help the client keep his/her housing; 
• taking clients to doctors' appointments or grocery store; 
• charting her notes; 
00:01:52 Description of clients and their homelessness; a large percentage of her clients don't access 
shelter as they are GLBT (Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, Transgender) individuals who feel 
traditional shelters are unsafe for them; they're outside or couch-hopping, staying with 
friends of family, in cars or abandoned buildings; 
00:02:47 How people find out about her work; case managers; in Minnesota, if you are HIV+ and 
working with an infectious disease clinic, you can get a medical case manager; prior to 
coordinated entry, Clare Housing only took applications through medical case managers; 
that's still how they find Clare Housing; Clare Housing only works with people who have 
HIV/AIDS, though a non-HIV/AIDS partner will also receive housing/services;

Number of clients she works with; rapid growth over the past year—including the doubling 
of her program; she supports 43 households (a more average number is 16 households) and 
they are hiring additional staff; 
How people afford housing; her program uses Group Residential (GRH) Housing, state 
funding, for the majority of her households; other funding is (Minnesota Housing Finance 
Agency) MHFA, mostly for families; and Shelter Plus Care (federal funding); Clare Housing 
receives 70% of its funding from the government; additional funding are CADI (Community 
Access for Disability Inclusion) waivers, another source of state funding); funding streams 
pay for rent, the cost of staff to provide supportive services, and other housing costs; 
Tynessia has clients access programs to help pay utilities or county emergency assistance if 
people need help; 
Discussion of how she knits resources together for people; GRH clients receive about $193 
in food stamps each month and $97 in cash and $105 to purchase toiletries online through 
Clare Housing; this doesn't always cover food costs, so she refers them to the Aliveness 
Project, Open Arms of Minnesota for meals/food shelf; more detailed discussion about 
funding streams and client challenges making ends meet; brief interruption with audio 
paused; 
Landlords and the shortage of affordable housing; reluctance to rent to her clients rather 
than someone who can pay a higher rent; clients with criminal background or unlawful 
detainers (part of an eviction) are especially difficult to find housing for; many of her clients 
are housed in the apartment building where this interview is taking place: the housing 
developer received tax credits (also called a Section 42 building) in exchange for making a 
certain number of units affordable; 
Challenges in finding housing for those with criminal histories, especially drug offenses, 
prostitution, arson, and sexual offenses; the more recent the offense the harder it is to find 
housing; if she finds a rundown property where the landlord cares less, the property must 
pass an inspection to receive the funding; Clare Housing-owned property may be an option; 
more about criminal offenses she sees; story about a woman with multiple unlawful 
detainers; clients who build their own relationships with landlords can convince them to 
rent to them; 
Homelessness and healthcare if you are HIV+; harder to see providers, take meds on time, 
eat right 
How Tynessia came to this work; went to college to be a chemical dependency counselor; 
internship overwhelmed her by the stories of what people had gone through and convinced 
her that this was what she wanted to do; worked for Turning Point; 
Strengths in this work; her mother taught her openness to different people; story about 
moving from Chicago to California; loves to network; is solutions-based; relationship with 
God and serving His people; a job that matters—story about working for the airlines in 
contrast; discussion of pay scale in the people-skill jobs; good communicator, especially with 
daunting paperwork; has been in her role for one year; newly created position; 
Challenges of the work; story of filling ten units with her family clients; behavior or mental 
health or chemical health can interfere with keeping housing; practices housing first and 
harm reduction, but private landlords have lower tolerance than Clare Housing; having to be 
the bearer of bad news from landlords;

Expectations from clients; depends on their skills; keep appointments; follow-through on 
plans; contact Tynessia immediately if there's a problem; 
Measuring success; story of a person she encouraged to work rather than be on a program; 
story about a client practicing not letting guests visit; commonly newly housed people want 
to provide a place for their still-homeless friends; discussion of how daunting housing 
responsibilities can feel; story of people who have not rented in decades; story of working at 
Salvation Army; story of a person who'd been there for two years who had no barriers but 
had never been housed; 
Works with people as long as they're in a Clare Housing program; some are independent 
and need very little contact; others need regular check-ins; 
Discussion of how this work has changed her perspective; has always worked in housing, but 
prior to working in a shelter she didn't realize how bad homelessness is; a greater 
compassion for people; she is very grateful for even small things; angrier at inequities, lack 
of resources; (brief interruption by visitor here); 
How her work is impacted by larger events; legislation and funding changes; healthcare 
changes, HIV meds cost $3000-$6000 for one 30-day pill prescription; aside about worrying 
for her clients while she and others will survive economic changes; weather can impede her 
getting to see people; story about a client who broke his leg in the winter; 
The future of her work; HIV and hope for a cure, but expects social work to always be a 
need; 
Wisdom for people entering the field; let go of what you believe to be "normal"; prepare to 
be educated; story about clients' resourcefulness; keep learning about new practices, 
knowledge, like "trauma" which wasn't a knowledge base a decade ago; description of 
trauma;
