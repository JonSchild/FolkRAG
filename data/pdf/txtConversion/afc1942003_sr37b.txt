"Dear Mr. President", Nashville, Tennessee, January or February 1942
AFS 6437B
Medical Student: Mr. President, I am a student at Meharry Medical College. I'm also a teacher in
one of the adult schools which this program is being run this evening. Many of our students ask the
teachers and ask me concerning the defense program and also information concerning the war.
Some of this information I have available at my fingertips that I can give them. But in so far as the
defense program is concerned, and why the Negro cannot get jobs when he is equally trained with
the white man, I am unable to answer that question. If any information is available at Washington,
D.C. I wish you could send some to the Fisk Social Center at Nashville, Tennessee.
