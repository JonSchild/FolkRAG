City, Utah) 
●
Lived in Utah before moving to Ohio about a year ago

Born in Bhutan, in 1989; left for Nepal due to “political problems,” and graduated from

through a refugee resettlement program; brief discussion of the Bhutanese-Nepali

●
Learning to cook at home, through Suk’s mother
●
Common meals in his family home -- lots of rice dishes
●
Navigating Nepali foodways as a refugee from Bhutan; “not really a big diﬀerence -- kind of 
similar; but the way of cooking is a little bit diﬀerent. The spices are pretty much similar; but 
the way of cooking is … diﬀerent. Because we use less spices than them; and we want to cook 
it ﬁrst, and fast.” 
●
00:09:00 -- Nepalese dishes at home: chow mein (an average lunch); dinner, rice with curries

00:10:19 -- adjusting to grocery stores & sourcing ingredients upon family move to Utah

Before the back-of-house work at the hospital and Tibetan restaurant, Suk worked at an 
undisclosed company
●
00:14:25 -- description of the hospital kitchen culture; hired in as “Cook 1” (a starting cook 
position) and worked his way up from doing that work (decorating plates) to, after ﬁve years, 
being the Head Chef at the hospital. This hospital did a hotel-style system, not a tray-line 
system: everything is ordered direct to the room, from a menu; but the menu could be 
tweaked depending on patient need. 
●
00:17:00 -- Suk describes the diﬃculty of being fairly new to the U.S., and having to quickly 
learn about American cuisine; “Sometimes it was hard to learn what dressings went with 
which salads.” He also describes taking each recipe home at night and “doing homework” to 
learn the recipes; which is part of what he credits to his success of rising up in the hospital 
kitchen system. He worked with one other Nepalese worker, who joined the hospital two 
months early. Other positions included prepping materials for the other cooks; and working 
at other stations throughout the kitchen (bakery, prepping areas, main kitchen line) before 
becoming the Head Chef, with responsibilities throughout. Suk describes liking prepping, 
because of making big portions.
