A HANDFUL OF TURF. 
As sung by Dicx DEvrax, of DEVLIN & TRACY, with great success. 
I'ts sailing I 
am at the dawn of the day, 
To my brother that's over the sea, 
And it's little I 
care for my life anywhere, 
For 'Us breaking my poor heart will be; 
But the treasure I 
take for old Ireland's sake, 
And I'll pledge all belonging above, 
'Tis a 
handful of turf from the land of me birth, 
From the heart of the country I 
love. 
(Repeat the last two lines.) 
Then won't that poor lad in his exile be glad, 
When he sees the bright present I 
bring ? 
And won't then the flowers in their elegant bowers 
Breath forth the perfume of spring ? 
Oh, Erin, Machrce though it's parted we'll be, 
'Tis a 
blessing I 
leave on your shore, 
Though your mountains and streams I 
will see in my 
dreams, 
'Till I 
cross to old Ireland once more. 
(Repeat as before.)

BRIGHT LITTLE SPOT. 
Words and Music by TED TRATNOR, and sung with great success by 
DEVLIN Sz TRACY. 
We're stout-hearted boys from the green shores of Erin; 
That Emerald set in the sea ; 
Where bounteous nature her best cloth appear in, 
And choicest gifts scattered free; 
Her mountains and valleys with produce abounding, 
Her rivers and lakes filled with life in galore; 
Loveliest scenes on all sides are surrounding, 
The home of the shamrock, old Ireland, • asthore. 
CHORUS. 
Hurrah for that bright, little spot on the ocean, 
Harmless around it the rude billows roar; 
True Irish hearts love with fondest devotion, 
The home of the shamrock, old Ireland, asthore. 
Dear granuail, her daughters are peerless, 
Pair and as fresh as morn ; 
Ever in battle her sons they are fearless, 
Death do I 
hold but in scorn; - 
Our hearts ever warm to welcome a 
stranger, 
Those in distress never turn from your door; 
And for our country we'll brave every danger, 
The home of the shamrock, old Ireland, asthore. 
I 
love the bright green, and I'm proud, boys, to wear it,' 
To it I 
will ever prove true; 
All loyal Irishmeht that feeling share it, 
Deeply, indeed, as I 
do; 
Distance or climate that bond cannot sever, 
True in our hearts all this wide world o'er; 
The land of St. Patrick, forget it, no, never! 
The home of the shamrock, old Ireland, asthore. 
Bridget Donohue I've Got My Eye on You. 
Sung with great success by Dvirrax & TRACY. 
My name is Barney Blake, I'm a 
taring Irish rake, 
Considered by my neighbors rather handy, 
I 
was reared to the spade, but I 
learned the tailoring trade, 
And things myself as good as John or Sandy. 
I 
work in first-class shops, I 
make clothes for swells and fops, 
I'm contented with my daily occupation, 
I 
love a 
colleen rue called Bridget Donohue, 
And she's the pride of all the Irish nation. 
CHORUS. 
Bridget Donohue, I've got my eye on you, 
If you only marry Barney you'll have no cause to rue, 
You're the apple of my eye, I'm your Irish cockatoo, 
Mr. Cupid knocked me stupid for Bridget Donohue. 
At the wedding of Pat O'Hare I 
first met Bridget there, 
As she sat beside the at the wedding supper, 
When she handad me my tay, I 
felt I 
cannot say, 
But my heart it melted like a 
lump of butter. 
I 
asked her there and then if she'd have me for a 
man, 
When she smiled on me as cute as any jailer, 
She said she would with pride, since that I'm satisfied, 
She loves none else but Barney Blake the tailor. 
She's modest as she's mild, she's a 
decent father's child, 
And I'm longing for the day of our marriage; 
You would go from here to Spain to hear her sing Napoleon's 
dream, 
And at dancing she's got a 
lovely carriage. 
The other logs may try to put out Barney's eye, 
But soon they'll find its nothing but a 
failure, 
She would't see me fooled, she's as pure as guinea gold, 
To her thumping, stumping, jump!og Irish tailor. 
PAT'S NOT SO BLACK AS FTF,'S PAINTED. 
Sung by PAT FEENEY with success; also by DEVLIN & TEAM. 
Ireland you know has been run down for years, 
Her sons by their foes have been treated with sneers, 
Which hurt their bold feelings, and caused them to shed tears, 
For they know not for why they were rejected. 
When we come to England to get work we did try, 
We tried, 'twas all in vain, they said, " No Irish need apply," 
Which made poor Paddy emigrate, or through starvation die, 
But now I'm glad to say we are respected. 
CHORUS. 
We fought for the thistle and we fought for the rose, 
We proved a 
credit to the land where the shamrock grows, 
And I 
am proud to say that now old England knows, 
That Pat's not so black as he's painted. 
England has proved that the sons of our soil, 
Are always light-hearted and willing to toil, 
Which proved when in battle it makes their true blood boil, 
Which shows they are brave and ever daring. 
England has also proved that each Irish colleen, 
Is as witty and as pretty as the finest girls that's seen, 
Although we have been run down by cowards sly -and mean, 
With the best in this world we're worth comparing. 
Then long may the shamrock entwine with the rose, 
Combined with the thistle, defy all our foes, 
And may the true friendship that's in each heart of ours, 
Keep us like true friends and ne'er be slighted. 
May peace and prosperity attend our darling shore; 
May health, wealth, and happiness, come freely to our poor; 
And may God defend us when we meet our foes in war, 
And keep us like true heroes united. 
GEM OF THE SEA. 
Written by Scorr SANDILAND, and sung by DEVLIN & TRACY with great 
success at the London Theatre, New York. 
Greeks and Romans may boast of their ancient heroes, ' 
Philosophers, poets and orators, too; 
But although we have never had Homers or Nero's, 
Had they ever a 
prince like brave Brian Borue ? 
A 
chieftain he was who made all the world fear us, 
In peace or in war he was dauntless and free; 
His shlagaun in battle oft-times did cheer us, 
He died for his country the Gem of the Sea. 
CHORUS. 
Then hurrah for old Erin, the birthplace of beauty, 
Hurrah for her daughters so fair tO be seen; 
Hurrah for her sons who in war do their duty, 
Hurrah for the shamrock, that plant ever green. 
And has for the poet on history's pages, 
One name, ' tis deeply engraved I 
am sure; 
His equal they never had in their dark ages, 
Long life to his memory, the gifted Tom Moore; 
Statesmen and patriots we've had in numbers, 
The brave Dan O'Connell remembered will be; 
And also poor Emmet, who in his grave slumbers, 
He died for his country, the Gem of the Sea. 
Let them talk of philosophers, old Thiojaneurs, 
That some people said lived inside a 
tub ; 
Compared to poor Paddy, we're certain quite green is,' 
A 
smile, faith Pat has for the world's hardest rub; - 
With his pipe and his glassful of smoking potheen, 
Sure no king on his throne is as happy as he; 
He's true to his friends and his darling colleen, 
Sure he'd die for his country, the Gem of the Sea. 
DEAR HARP OF MY COUNTRY. 
THE MINSTREL BOY. 
Written by T. Moon. 
Sung by DEVIIN & TR/CY. 
1
, 'Dear harp of my country! in darkness I 
found thee, 
The cold chain of silence had hung o'er thee long, 
When proualy, my own island harp! I 
unbound thee, 
And gave all thy chords to light, freedom, and song I 
The warm lay of love and the light note of gladness 
Have wakened thy fondest, thy liveliest thrill; 
But so oft hast thou echo'd the deep sigh of sadness, 
t
. That ev'n in thy mirth it will steal from thee still. 
Dear harp of my country! farewell to thy numbers. 
This sweet wreath of song is the last we shall twine; 
Go,—sleep, with the sunshine of fame on thy slumbers, 
'Till touch'd by some hand less unworthy than mine. 
If the pulse of the patriot, soldier, or lover, 
Have throbb'd at our lay, ' tis thy glory alone; 
was but as the wind, passing heedlessly over, 
L
And all the wild sweetness I 
wak'd was thy own! 
Sting by DEVLIN & TRACY, at the London Theatre, New York. 
Send for a 
Free Catalogue of Tricks. 
The Minstrel Boy to the war is gone, 
In the ranks of death you'll find him; 
His father's sword he has girded on, 
And his wild harp slung behind him. 
" 
Land of Song," said the warrior-bard, 
Tho' all the world betrays thee, 
One sword, at least, thy rights shall guard, 
One faithful harp shall praise thee!" 
The Minstrel fell; but the foeman's chain 
Could not bring his proud soul under; 
The harp he loved ne'er spoke again, 
For he tore its chords asunder, 
And said: " No chains shall sully thee, 
Thou soul of love and bravery! 
Thy songs were made for the pure and free, 
They shall never sound in slavery." 
There Never Was a 
Coward Where the 
Shamrock Grows, 
Let cowardly slanderers say what they will 
Against the dear land of my birth, 
Still I 
will maintain in spite of all foes, 
It's the brightest bright spot upon earth. 
Sonic say we are cowards, and lit for naught else 
Beside drinking our own made potheen, 
But I 
throw back that villainous lie in their face, 
We are brave as the Shamrock is green. 
CHORUS. 
Pat may be foolish, and very often wrong, 
Pat's got a 
temper, that don't last very long, 
Pat is fond of jollity, as everybody knows, 
There never was a 
coward where the Shamrock grows. 
The time is at hand, now, when perhaps you will need 
The men from the Emerald Isle, 
But just speak the word, and for you he will bleed, 
On a 
foreign and far distant soil; 
For bravery undaunted, they are so well known, 
That they'll make our foes tremble with fear; 
When led by such men as the great Wellington, 
You may cry out that victory is near. 
Then England and Ireland, their hands should unite, 
In brotherly love let them twine, 
As members of this little part of the world, 
In other great parts will they shine. 
We'll fight hand in hand, and make the foe run 
As we did in the days that are gone, 
We'll Cause them to cry with a 
deep heavy sigh, 
That's England and Ireland in one. 
THE ROSE AND THE SHAMROCK. 
Sung by DEVLIN & 'flues. 
I 
love my native country, and I 
am not to blame, 
And every man, no matter who, he ought to do the same, 
The Englishman loves England, and why not I 
love mine ? 
For Englishmen and Irishmen, their hearts and hands 
should join. 
CHORUS. ' 
When the rose and the shamrock in love are entwined, 
And England and Ireland in friendship combined; 
Then we can show when our flags are unfurled, 
That America and Ireland, can face all the world. 
Our interests are both the same, as you may plainly see, 
And I 
see no reason, that we should disagree, 
Place us upon one footing, and the world we can defy, 
And if they think to conquer us, they had better come and 
try. 
Chorus—When the rose and the shamrock, etc. 
You talk about your soldiers, yet old Ireland can boast, 
Of soldiers, yes, and generals too, and of patriots a 
host. 
With England hand in hand, 110 foreign power they fear, 
For we taught the bear a 
lesson, on the shores of the 
Crimea. 
Chorus—When the rose and the shamrock, etc. 
The Russian bear is growling near, but we fear not his 
growl, 
For if he is not careful, he will soon be made to howl. 
With his million men in fighting trim, don't make us feel 
afraid, 
While we have our Connaught Rangers, and our gallant 
Light Brigade. 
Chorus — When the rose and the shamrock, etc. 
Sung with great success by DEVLIN & TRAcY. 
When an Irishman leaves the dear land of his birth, 
And he crosses the wild raging sea, 
Oh, his heart will fly back to the land that he loved, 
No matter wherever he be. 
And oft in the wilds of some far distant shore, 
That if wafted acr.oss o'er the breeze, 
An image will rise, and fill him with sighs, 
For this is the picture that he sees. 
CHORUS. 
There's a 
glorious ould round tower in Ireland, 
There's the purty little shamrock so green, 
There's the wolf-dog lying down, 
And the harp without the crown, 
And the sun- bursts of Ireland between. 
In the halls of the great, and the cots of the poor, 
There's a 
sight that is always to be seen, 
It is the dear little shamrock we all do adore, 
And long may its memories be kept green. 
The flag of a 
stranger may float o'er our coast, 
But the banner each Irishman bears, 
Is engraved on his heart with a 
pencil of love, 
For this is the emblem that he wears. 
And long may these memories remain on each breast, 
As it sees the round Tower dJes stand; 
May the scenes of past glory never depart, 
As the sun sheds its rays o'er our land. 
May the harp so long silent arise from its gloom 
And sound its broad song as of yore; 
May the green flag of Ireland be once more unfurled, 
And float o'er our own native shore. 
GEM. OF THE EMERALD ISLE. 
Words and Music by PAT FEENEY, and dedicated and sung by Dnvant 
Tic, the Great Irish Vocalists, at Harry Miner's 
Theatre, New York. 
I'll sing now in praise of the gem of old Ireland, 
Whose names are respected by friend and by foe; 
Of the men who proud to acknowledge their sireland, 
Of men who gained fame by words and by blow; 
Their hearts brave and true, never knew any danger, 
As cheerfully they for their country did toil; 
It must be acknowledged by friend and by stranger, 
That they were bright gems from the Emerald Isle. 
First is Brian Borne, the great Ring whose example 
If followed by Monarchs of this present day; 
A 
blessing would prove, for his wisdom was ample, 
lie knew how to rule in a 
true Kingly way; 
Brave Patrick Sarsfield, exiled from his sireland, 
Exclaimed as he died on a 
foreigner's soil: 
Oh, may Heaven grant freedom for old Ireland 
Then died a 
bright gem of the Emerald Isle. 
If we boast of. our gems, surely no one can blame us, 
When we've produced men like those I 
will name; 
Balfe Wallace and Tom Moore who made themselves 
famous, 
With music and poetry they gained their fame. 
There's Sheridan, Goldsmith, and Swift, thnie more 
great men, 
What nation on earth ever equaled their style; 
There's Davitt, Daily, and Killen, three more great 
Statesmen; 
All these are bright gems of the Emerald Isle.

THE HARP OF OLD IRELAND. 
Sung by DEv-trg & TRACY. 
The dear harp of Ireland resounds once again; 
Let the harp of old Ireland resound once again; 
'Tis a 
sound that we all like to hear. 
Let us hear as of yore its melodious strains, 
Which to Irishmen's hearts are so dear. 
'Twill denote peace and happiness when it is heard, 
Bring joy to our dear sister isle, 
And cement a strong friendship much stronger than 
words, 
Between this and dear Ireland's rich soil. 
CHORUS. 
So strike up the harp of old Ireland once more; 
Let us hear its melodious strain. 
May its echoes resound through its own native shore; 
Let us hear its sweet tones once again. 
The dear harp of Ireland resounds'once again; 
Let the harp of old Ireland resound once again, 
Fond men:Cries 'tis sure to recall 
To the time that's now past when its musical strain, 
Was echoed through Tara's sweet hall. 
Tho' years have passed by since its music was heard, 
We welcome its tone just the same, 
As we do the sweet song of our own native birds, 
Let us hear the old harp once again. 
Chorus—So strike up the harp, etc.

,1111 OFF TO SHEER THE CORN. 
As sung by DICK Dzylaw, of DEviali & TRACY, with great success. 
Here I 
am an Irish boy, 
Who is always fond of mirth, 
And show me the creature 
Who would slight me for ray birth; 
And I 
have a 
neat coleen, 
In Dublin far behind,— 
I 
always was a 
broth of a 
boy, 
And my coleen she is blind. 
CHORUS. 
Good-bye, Biddy dear, 
It's hard to part from you, 
Although I 
am going to leave you, 
Me heart it will prove true, 
Then cheer me vourneen, 
And don't look so forlorn, 
The harvest time is coming 
And I'm off to sheer the corn. 
I 
wouldn't have left Ireland, 
But times were hard, you know, 
To see the starving creatures, 
It would break the heart of stone, 
I 
bundled up my kit, 
While Biddy wept and sigh'd, 
And as the vessel left the dock, 
I 
step'd on board and cried,— 
Chorus— Good-bye, Biddy dear, etc.

Down, Down, Sweet County Down; or, 
Donaghadee. 
Sung with great success by DEVLIN & TRLCY. 
It is in sweet Ireland, my home, 
The place that I 
loved so dear, 
It is the place where my forefathers slept, 
And sure to the sea it is near. 
It is only an humble cottage, 
But none that is dearer to me, 
It's Down, Down, sweet County Down, 
And they call it sweet Donaghadee. 
CHORUS. 
Down, Down, sweet County Down, 
I 
love you where'er I 
may be; 
It is my sweet little town, 
And they call it sweet Donaghadee. 
From Belfast away only ninepence you pay, 
To go by the Bangor steamer, 
And there by ear you ride, but not far, 
To my home that's so dear to me. 
And there to the right of the.village, 
And close to the clear Irish Sea, 
It is there where you'll find my home, 
Away down in Donaghadee. 
Then never more will I 
leave my home, 
Across the salt cea to roam, 
But stay in the cot that's so dear to me, 
In the neat little village of Donaghadee; 
Then never more will I 
leave it, 
Where my brothers have dwelt before me, 
It is there where we always lived, 
And we'll die in Donaghadee.

I 
Left Ireland and Mother Because We 
were Poor. 
Composed by DOCKSTADER. As sung by Dicic DEvxxs, of DEVLIN 
& 
TRACY, with great success. 
There's a 
dear spot in Ireland, 
That I 
long to see, 
It's my own little birth place 
Sure its heaven to me, 
Where my poor widowed mother lives there all alone 
In a 
neat little cabin our own happy home, 
We hadn't much money, but my poor mother dear, 
Put a 
kiss on my brow bid me heart be good cheer, 
Though the shadows of poverty stood in our door, 
I 
left Ireland and mother because we were poor. 
Sure I 
ne'er can forget on that bright rosy morn, 
When leaving old Ireland my poor heart did mourn. 
And my dear widowed mother said be of good cheer, 
Good bye Mikel darling, good bye mother dear, 
And my brothers and sisters took me by the hand, 
Sure my heart it near broke when I 
left dear Ireland, 
For the shadows of poverty stood in our door, 
I 
left Ireland and mother because we were poor. 
Since leaving old Ireland my poor mother's died, 
God bless and protect him were the last words she said, 
And the ring that my father gave she sent to me; 
Sure a 
jewel far brighter than gold unto me, 
My brothers and sisters I 
wish they were heie, 
I 
have sent for them all and they'll come never fear, 
I've a 
neat little cot on America's shore, 
Where we'll all live together although we are poor.

THE BARD OF ARMAGH. 
As sung with great success by DICK DEiriaN, of DEvr-nq & TRACY. 
Oh, list to lay of a 
poor Irish harper, 
And scorn not the strains of his mild withered band, 
But remember his fingers they once moved sharper, 
As he sang to the praise of his dear native land; 
It is low* since the Shamrock our dear Isle's lov'd em-
blem, 
Was pluck'd from the soil by the Saxon's wild paw, 
I 
was called by the colleens around me assembled, 
Their bold Phelim Brady, the bard of Armagh, 
I 
was called by the colleens around me assembled, 
Their bold Phelim Brady, the bard of Aimagh. 
How I 
love to muse on the days of my boyhood, 
Tho' four score years have flown by since then; 
Oh, sweet recollection, how dear the reflection, 
The wildest of boys make the best.of old men. 
At a 
fair or a 
wake I 
would twist my shillelah, 
And trip thro' a 
dance wid my brogues tied wid straw, 
I 
was called by the colleens around me assembled, 
Their own Phelim Brady, the bard of Armagh, 
I 
was called by the colleens around me assembled, 
Their own Phelim Brady, the bard of Armagh. 
In truth I 
have wandered this wide world all over, 
Yet Ireland's my home .and the land that I 
love, 
And when cruel death to his cold arms shall take me, 
And my soul shall have flown to the sweet realms 
above, 
Then, oh! let the turf that my old bones shall cover, 
Be that of dear Erin, old Erin go bragh, 
By the side of my Kathleen, my good wire, God bless 
her; 
Lay your own Phelim Brady, the bard of Armagh. 
By the side of my Kathleen, my good wife, God bless 
her, 
Lay your own Phelim Brady, the bard of Armagh.

TREAT PAT AS A 
FRIEND AND A 
MAN. 
I 
Tritten by T. BsowNE, and sung by PAT FEENEY. 
Made popular by 
DEVLIN Sz TRACY. 
It's amighty big world is the one where we live, 
And in it there's room for us all; 
So I 
can't make out how some people will try 
To push Irish folks to the wall. 
Why refuse them a 
chance to exist with the rest ? 
Why treat them with scorn everywhere ? 
They never did evil, to merit such frown, 
So you can't call it honest or fair. 
CHORUS. 
Then do as you'd like to be done by yourselves, 
You'll find it the very best plan, 
Be friendly and true, as he is to you, 
And treat Pat as a 
friend and a 
man. 
Can you blame him for loving the land of his birth ? 
Though he leaves it to seek bread elsewhere, 
'Tis because his own country's so crush'd down and poor, 
That he has no chance to live there. 
He comes over here to assist those at home, 
Yet folks sneer, and they say ' tis a 
shame, 
When they ought to assist him and pity, instead, 
Of giving him undeserved blame. 
If a 
foreigner coins, be he black, white, or brown, 
A 
visit to England to pay, * 
He's welcomed and honored by all, rich and poor, 
Though he's come to take something away; 
Yet an Irishman comes here to work for his bread, 
lie waits long for a 
kind helping hand, 
There's a 
welcome for strangers, but none for your own, 
That's what I 
cannot understand. 
In many a 
battle, on land and on sea, 
Our heroes their hearts'-blood have shed 
For England, and so you should treat us as friends, 
It but out of respect for the dead. 
As friends we can both help the others along, 
We can never be happy as foes, 
So may we soon see in friendship the three, 
The shamrock, the thistle, and rose.

JOHN MITCHEL. 
As sung with great success by Dim DETLIN, of DEVLIN & MUM. 
I 
am a 
true born Irishman, 
John Mitchel is my name, 
To free my own brave country, 
From Newey town I 
came; 
I 
struggled hard both night and day, 
For to free my native land, 
For which I 
was transported, boys, 
As you may understand. 
When first I 
found my countrymen, 
It was in forty-two, 
And then what follows after 
I 
will quickly tell to you: 
I 
rose the standard of repeal, 
And gloried in that deed, 
And I 
vowed to Heaven that I 
n'er would rest 
Until Ireland it was free. 
While in prison close confined, 
Waiting for my trial day, 
My loving wife she came to me, 
And these words to me did say: 
Oh, John, my dear, cheer up your heart, 
And daunted do not, do not be, 
For it's better to die for Erin's rights, 
Than to live in slavery. 
Where I 
received my sentence, 
It was on a 
foreign ground, 
Where hundreds of my comrads, 
Assembled all around; 
My liberty was offered to me, 
If I 
would forsake their cause, 
But I 
would rather die ten thousand deaths, 
Than forsake my Irish boys.

THE BELLS SHANDON. 
21 
As sung by DICK DtvLas, of DEvLiN & TRACY, with great success. 
With deep affection and recolleetion, 
I 
often think of those Shandon bells, 
Whose sounds so wild would in days of childhood 
Fling round my cradle their magic.spell; 
On this I 
ponder where'er I 
wander, 
Arid then grow fonder, sweet Cork of dice; 
With thy bells of Shandon sound far more grand on 
The pleasant waters of the river Lee. 
I've heard bells chiming full many a 
clime in 
Tolling sublime in cathedral shrine; 
While at a 
glibe rate brass tongues would vibrate, 
But all their music spoke naught like thine; 
For inenCry dwelling, on each proud swelling 
Of thy belfry, knelling its bold notes free, 
Made the bells of Shandon sound far more grand on 
The pleasant waters of the river Lee. 
I've heard bells tolling " Old Adra in's mole" in 
Their thunders rolling from the Vatican 
With cymbals glorious, swinging uproarious, 
In the gorgeous, turrets of Notre Dame; 
But thy sounds more sweeter than the dome of Peter 
Flin 2:s o'er the Tiher pealing solemnly. 
Oh ! the bells of Shandon sound far more grand on 
The pleasant waters of the river Lee. 
There's a 
hell in Moscow, while on tow'r and kiosk 0! 
In St. Sophia the Turkman gets, 
And loud in air calls men to prayer 
From the tap-ring summit of tall minarets; 
Such empty phantom I 
freely grant them ; 
But there's an anthem more dear to me, 
'Tis the bells of Shandon that sound so gi and on 
The pleasant waters of the river Lee.

THE ROSE OF TRAIJE,E.,, 
Words by Scan &W EILAND, and sung by DEVLIN k TRACT with great 
success at all the principal Theatres in America. 
A 
short time ago when in Erin's green isle, 
Where freedom for ages has not dared to smile; 
I 
journeyed o'er mountains, through valley and plain, 
And what I 
beheld, may I 
ne'er see again. 
A 
cabin I 
saw, but deserted it seemed, 
The Wintry sun on its roof cheerlessly gleamed; 
No smoke from the chimney curled up to the sky, 
Nor was there a 
trace of life as I 
drew nigh. 
The deadly wolf want, though, in that cot did reign, 
The struggle to keep him out had been in vain; 
Appalled, there I 
stood, touched to the heart's core, 
Now, I'll tell you my thoughts, as I 
stood by the dour: 
A 
child's voice I 
heard, it was puny and weak, 
In faltering tones the poor creature did speak; 
It begged very hard for a 
small piece of bread, 
Its mother through hunger, lay silent and dead. 
The father looked on, ah! but helpless was he, 
The sight, I 
am sure, it was dreadful to see. 
All in the place had been seized on for rent, 
The landlords with nothing else would be content., 
Assistance I 
gave, but, alas! 'twas too late, 
Child followed mother, a 
terrible fate; 
May I 
never again have such scenes to deplore, 
These were my thoughts, as I 
stood by the door. 
Sung by DEVLIN & TRACY, the Irish Nightingales. 
The pale moon was rising above the green mountains, 
The sun was declining beneath the blue sea, 
When I 
stray'd with my love to the pure crystal fountain, 
That stands in the beautiful vale of Tralee. 
She was lovely and fair as the rose of the summer,. 
Yet 'twas not her beauty alone that won me, 
Oh, no, ' twas the truth in her eye ever dawning. 
That made me love Mary, the Rose of Tralee. 
The cool shades of evening their mantle was spreading, 
And Mary, all smiling, was list'ning to me, 
2 
The moon through the valley her pale rays was shedding, 
When I 
won the heart of the Rose of Tralee. 
Tho' lovely and fair as the rose of the summer, 
Yet 'twas not her beauty alone that won me, 
Oh, no, ' twas the truth in her eye ever dawning, 
That made me love Mary, the Rose of Tralee.

I 
Won't Hear Old Ireland Run Down, 
Writted by Tont BROWNE, and sung by DEVLIN & TRACT. 
There's a 
dear little spot called the Emerald Isle, 
And there one fine day I 
was born, 
So that is the reason my blood always boils, 
When people speak of it with scorn. 
Her sons and her daughters are gallant and fair, 
And the country itself is so grand, 
That I 
cannot imagine why people should speak 
In dispraise of my dear native land. 
C11011tS. 
•So— Hurrah for old Ireland, tho land of my birth, 
Her sons have gained famous renown, 
'Tis known as a 
glorious picture on earth, 
So I 
won't hear old Ireland run down. 
I'm sure that no Irishman ever need be 
Ashamed of those heroes gone by, 
Who fought like true Irishmen only can do, 
When foes of their country were nigh; 
And In modern times, when for England they fought, 
They were foremost and first in the fray, 
And at the Crimea, when danger was near, 
, 
Pat never kept out of the way. 
The names of O'Connell, and all such as he, 
Should make every Irishman proud, 
They were Ireland's heroes, and showed that they were 
With wit and with wisdom endowed; 
They spoke for their country, as every man should, 
No matter what country or creed, 
So we never need be ashamed of Ireland's sons, 
For they proved true in thought, word, and deed.

And go roaming with you, Barney McCoy. 
I

That until the Judgment Day, 
You will never see your Barney any more. 
I

If my mother and the rest of them were there, 
For I

In that dear land of the West, 
Living happy with you, Barney McCoy 
I 
am going far away, Norah darling, 
And the ship is now anchored in the bay, 
And before to- morrow's sun 
You will hear the signal gun, 
So be ready, it will carry us away.

On duty in the public park, observed by young and old, 
A dandy man, of pretty girls you'll hear it often told, 
The finest man upon the force, you'll hear it often said, 
Is stationed in the public park, his name is Tim McQuade. 
I 
never mix in common rows, to soil my raiment new, 
I'd rather promenade the park or walk the avenue; 
Where every pair of eyes I

And always whisper words of praise, for I

There's notes and button-hole bouquets await me on my way, 
From all the servant girls that come on purpose every day,

My mother's heart will nearly break when I

They're poor and almost helpless, they're old and feeble, too, 
So I

Oh, who will love the old folks, when I 
am far away? 
Oh, who will cheer their sad hearts day by day? 
They've petted and caressed me through childhood's tender 
years, 
And now I'm leaving them in grief and tears. 
But I 
will write a 
letter when I've found some work to do, 
And tell them how I 
missed them, that my heart to them

Their faces then will brighten, when they shall both read

I'll write it and I'll seal it with a

Between Millionaires and Aldermen, 
To get her for a

It was on one fine morning for soft recreation, 
I 
heard a 
fair damsel making a 
moan, 
Sighing and sobbing with sad lament aim, 
saying my Blackbird most loyal has flown. 
My thoughts they deceived me, reflection it grieves me, 
And I 
am o'er- burdened with sad misery; 
But if death should blind me, as true love inclines me, 
My Blackbird I'll seek out wherever I 
be. 
Once in fair England my Blackbird did flourish, 
He was the chief flower that in it did spring, 
Fair ladies of honor his person did nouxish, 
Because that he was the true sun of a 
king. 
But oh! that false fortune has proved so uncertain, 
That oaus'd the parting between you and me, 
But if he remain in Prance or in Spain, 
I'll be true to my Blackbird wherever he be. 
In England my Blackbird and I 
were together, 
When he was the most noble and gen'rous of heart; 
But woe to the time when he arrived there, 
Alas! ho was soon forced from me to part. 
In Italy he beam'd and was highly esteemed, 
In England he seems but a 
stranger to me, 
But if he remain in Franco or in Spain, 
All blessings on my Blackbird wherever he be. 
But if by the fowler my Blackbird is taken, 
Sighing and sobbing will be all the tune, 
But if he is safe, and Fru not mistaken, 
I 
hope I 
shall see him in May or in June. 
The birds of the forest, they all flock together, 
The turtle was chosen to dwell with the dove, 
So I'm resolved in fair or foul weather, 
Once in the Spring to seek out my love. 
Oh, he is all my treasure, my joy and my pleasure, 
He's justly belov'd though my heart loilow thee, 
flow constant and kind, and cour igeaus of mind, 
Deserving of blessing wherevcr he be. 
It's not the wide ocean can fright me with danger, 
Although like a 
pilgrim I 
wander forlorn, 
For l'll find more friendship from one that's a 
stranger, 
More than from one than in Britain was born

Though seas now divide, and the mountains so wide, 
I'll never once forget you far away; 
But I 
treasure still the flower that you gave me one 
sweet hour, 
When we watched the lads and lasses dancing gay, 
You've longed for my coming, and I've wept. bitter 
tears, 
Your Scotch lassie still is your own; 
She never will be false, for her heart she left with you 
No! your lassie, blue-eyed lassie will be true. 
Cirortus: 
Oh, laddie, my laddie far away, 
Still would your darling die for you; 
She never will be false, ah, no! no matter what they 
say, 
No, your lassie, blue-eyed lassie will be true. 
Then, love, don't forget that I 
think of you yet, 
Mid Scotland's bonnie hills across the sea; 
And though far away I 
roam, au! I 
know there Is a 
home 
That is waiting there, my own, for you and me; 
DI come to you laddie, like the bird to its nest, 
For still I

Of all this world so fair I 
am loving you the best. 
And your lassie, blue-eyed lassie will be true. 
As sung with great success by TONI :
FAST011. The greatest and 
mort popular song in :Tow York. 
Don't call me weak-minded, perchance I 
should sing, 
Of the dearest old spot upon earth; 
And don't think me foolish should memory bring, 
To my mind the dear land of my birth; 
With its hills arid its valleys, its mountains and vales, 
Of which our forefathers would boast; 
Of a 
dear little island all covered with green, 
Ah, but list' and I'll give you an Irishman's toast. 
Cnor.us: 
Here's to the land of the shamrock so green, 
Here's to each boy and his darling colleen. 
here's to the ones we love dearest and most, 
May God speed old Ireland, that's an Irishman's toast. 
My mind's eye oft pictures my old cabin home, 
Where it stood by the murmuring rill, 
Where my playmates and I 
oft together did roam, 
Through the castle that stood on the hill; 
But the stout hand of time has destroyed the old cot, 
And the farm now lies barren and bare; 
Around the old porch there is ivy entwined, 
But the birds seem to warble this toast in the air. 
(Chorus). 
The church and the schoolhouse have long been replarpd, 
In the Harp Hotel dwells a 
new host; 
The white haired old veteran has long been at rest, 
And his wife has deserted her post; 
King Death, the stern reaper, has called them away, 
And their children have gone o'er theseas; 
There is nothing but strangers around the old spot. 
Still this toast seems to waft to my ears on the breeze.

Sung by CHAS. KONOLLMAN 
The spell is past, the dream is o'er, 
And tho' we meet, we love no more! 
One heart is erusied to droop and die, 
And for relief, must heav'nward fly! 
The once bright smile has faded—gone, 
And given way to looks forlorn! 
Despite her grandeur's wicked flame, 
She stoops to blush beneath her shame. 
CHORUS. 
We never speak as we pass by, 
Altho' a 
tear bedims her eye; 
I 
know she thinks of her past life, 
When we were loving man and wife. 
In guileless youth I 
sought her side, 
And she became my virtuous bride; 
Our lot was peace so fair, so bright; 
One sunny day, no gloomy night! 
No life on earth more pure than ours, 
In that dear home, midst field and flowers 
Until the tempter came to : 
It dazzled her—alas! she fell! 
We never speak, etc. 
In gilded hall, midst wealth she dwells: 
How her heart aches, her sad face tells. 
She fain would smile, seem bright and gay, 
But conscience steals her peace away. 
And when the flatt'rer casts aside 
My fallen and dishonored bride, 
I'll close her eyes in leath, forgive, 
And in my heart her name shalt live. 
We never speak, etc.

OVER THE GARDEN WALL. 
Sung with great suetachs by FANNIE and JEPPE-DELANO. 
Oh! my love stood under the walnut tree, 
Over the garden wall; 
She whispered and said she'd be true to me, 
Over the garden wall. 
She'd beautiful eyes, and beautiful hair, 
She was not very tall, so she stood on a 
chair, 
And many a 
time have I 
kissed her there, 
Over the garden wall. 
Chorus—Over the garden wall, 
The sweetest girl of all, 
There never was yet such eyes of jet, 
And you cap bet I'll never forget 
The night our lips in kisses met, 
Over the garden wall. 
But her father stamped and her father raved, 
Over the garden wall, 
And like an old mad-man he behaved, 
Over the garden wall; 
She made a 
bouquet of roses red, 
But immediately I 
popped up my head, 
He gave me a 
bucket of water, instead, 
Over the garden wall. 
(Chorus). 
One day I 
jumped down on the other side, 
Over the garden wall, 
And she bravely promised to be my bride, 
Over the garden wall -.' 
But she screamed in a 
fright, " Here's father, quick, 
I 
have an impression he's bringing a 
stick," 
But I 
brought the impression of half a 
brick, 
Over the garden wall. 
(Chorus). 
But where there's a 
will there's always a 
way, 
Over the garden wall, 
There's always a 
night as well as a 
day, 
Over the garden wall; 
We hadn't much money, but weddings are cheap, 
So while the old fellow was snoring asleep, 
With a 
lad and a 
ladder she. managed to creep 
Over the garden wall.

There it stands in the corner with its back to the wall, 
The old wooden rocker, so stately and tall, 
With naught to disturb it but the duster or broom, 
For no one now uses that back parlor room; 
Oh, how well I 
remember in days long gone by, 
When we stood by that rocker my sister and I, 
And we listened to the stories that our grandma would tell 
By that old wooden rocker we all loved so well. 
Cnonus: 
As she sat by the fire she would rock, rock, rock, 
And we heard but the tick of the old brass clock; 
Eighty years she had sat in that chair grim and tall, 
in that old wooden rocker that stood by the wall. 
If this chair could but speak, oh, the tales it could tell, 
How poor aged grandpa in tierce battle fell, 
'Neath the stars and the stripes he fought bravely and true 
He cherished his freedom, the red, white and blue; 
It could tell of bright days, and of dark one, beside, 
Of the day when dear grandma stood forth as a 
bride, 
This is why we all love it, this old chair grim and tall, 
The old wooden rocker that stands by the wall. 
(Chorus). 
But poor grandma is gone, and her stories are done, 
Her children have followed her, yes, one by one, 
They have all gone to meet 11...r in the " sweet by-and-bye," 
And all that is left is dear sister and I; 
Never more will we hide her gold specks or her cap, 
Never more will we tease her while taking her nap, 
Never more will she slumber in that chair grim and tall, 
T_Lie old wooden rocker that stood by the wall.

The woodbine spices are wafted abroad 
And the musk of the roses blown, 
A breeze of morning moves, 
And the planet of love is on high, 
Beginning to faint in the light that she loves, 
On a 
bed of daffodil sky, 
To faint in the light of the sun she loves, 
To faint in the light and to die. 
Queen Rose of the rosebud, garden of girls 
Come hither the dances are done, . 
In gloss of satin and glimmer of pearls, 
Queen, lily, and rose in one. 
Shine out little head running over with curls 
To the .flowers and be their sun. 
She is coming my own, my sweet, 
Were it ever so airy a 
tread, 
My heart would hear it and beat, 
Were it earth on an earthly bed. 
Come my own, my sweet, 
Maud, Maud, come; 
: I'm here at the gate alone.

In the ebening by de moonlight, when dis darkey's work 
was over, 
We would gather round de fire, till de hoe-cake it was 
done; 
Den we all would eat our supper. after dat we'd clear de 
kitchen, 
Dat's de only time we had to spare, to bab a 
little fun; 
Uncle Gabe would take de fiddle down, dat hung upon de 
wall, 
While de silvery moon was shining clear and bright; 
How de old folks Would enjoy it, dey would sit all night 
and listen, 
As we sang in de ebening by the moonlight. 
Cuonus: 
In de ebening by de moonlight, you could hear us darkies 
singing, 
In de ebening by de moonlight, you could, hear de banjo 
ringing; 
How de old folks would enjoy it, dey would sit all night 
and listen, 
As we sang in de ebening by de moonlight. 
In de ebening- by de moonlight, when de watch-dog would 
be sleeping, 
In de corner near de fire-place, beside de old arm-chair; 
"Whar Aunt Chloe used to sit and tell de piccaninnies sto-
ries, 
And de cabin would be filled wid merry coons from near 
and far; 
All dem happy times we used to hab, will ne'er return 
apin, 
Eb'rything was then so merry, gay and bright; 
And .1 
neber will forget it, when our daily toil was ober,

PADDY MOORE'S WEDDING. 
uti 
with great success by KITTY COLEMAN & DAN MCCARTHY 
in their Sketch entitled The Irish Fair. 
There's joy about the city, and people are getting ready 
For to. go and attend a 
party that's given by Paddy 
Moore; 
The flags they are at full mast, and the bells toll in full 
blast, 
And every one is sighing for the pleasure that's in store. 
And Paddy's sister, Bridget, will meet you at the door, 
Every one will greet you, there will be a 
hundred there 
or more; 
And the band and pipes will play, and be heard for miles 
t. 
away, 
And the boys and girls will sing and dance at Paddy 
Moore's to-day. 
The dancing will be splendid, the music sweetly blending, 
And every one attending will have plenty there, galore, 
And Paddy Moore sure he will be as happy as can be, 
About his golden wedding that takes place this evening. 
Chorus. 
None of That in Mine, 
New songs are now the programme, 
And order of the day, 
As I 
like to keep up with the times, 
I 
have to run that way ; 
New by-words come up every day, 
And are soon put into rhyme. 
But the latest one that's got the boys, 
is, I'll take none of that in mine. 
I 
wouldn't be old Lucy Stone, 
'Who goes in for woman's rights, 
For then to catch a 
sweetheart, 
I'd never have a 
sight ; 
I'm not such a 
foolish elf, 
As to live single all the time, 
And as for dying an old maid, 
I 
don't want any of Mal in mine. 
I 
wouldn't be a 
yankee, 
• 
And hail from Lowell town, 
For there a 
cross-eyed Congressman, 
Is oft seen bobbing round ; 
He always takes all he can see, 
And keeps grabbing all the time, 
When it comes to nipping silver spoons, 
I 
wont have any of that tri mine. 
I 
wouldn't be a 
radical, 
Just at the present station, 
For I 
can't go the President, 
Nor any of his relations; 
I 
have no bull pups to give him, 
Or presents of any kind, 
And when it comes to loving niggers, 
I 
don't want any of that in Mine.

In the United States 31. P.;

Skip the gutter Alexander, tra-la-la-lee. 
They dressed me in a 
suit of soldiers clothes, 
And the pants. shure they fit me like two sacks; 
With an army jacket all bound around with yellow, 
With great big numbers on my back. 
But I've wrote to my Mary Ann, • 
For to 
an Alderman and also for to try 
To get my Uncle Barney for to go and see Dennis 
Kearny, 
To have me home by the fourth of next July, 
Now it's when I 
get my money in my fist, 
Its then I'll be happy and serene; 
And its down Broadway I'll march so gay, 
With my turkey and my suit of Jeans. 
And with my Mary Ann, I 
will be a 
happier man 
Than ever I 
have been since the war; 
And I'll get a 
s:tuation upon the corporation, 
And I'll never carry a 
musket any more.

I'm thinking to-night of the old rustic bridge, 
That bends o'er the murmuring stream; 
'Twas there, Maggie dear, with our hearts full of cheer, 
We stray'd neath the moon's gentle gleam. 
'Twas there I 
first met you—the light of your eyes 
Awoke in my heart a 
sweet thrill, 
Tho' now far away, stilt my thoughts fondly stray, 
To the old rustic bridge by the mill. 
CHORUS: 
Beneath it the stream gently rippled, 
Around it the birds loved to trill; 
Tho' now far away, still my thoughts fondly stray, 
To the old rustic bridge by the mill. 
How often, dear Maggie, when years passed away, 
And we plighted lovers became; 
We rambled the path to the bridge day by day, 
The smileg of each other to claim; 
But one day we parted in pain and regret, 
Our vows then we could not fulfil; 
Oh! may we soon meet and our fond love repeat, 
On the old ruStie bridge by the mill. ( Chorus). 
I 
keep in my mem'ry our love of the past— 
With me tis as bright as of old; 
For deep in my heart it was planted to last, 
In absence it never grows cold. 
I 
think of you, darling, when lonely at night, 
And when all is peaceful and still; 
lly heart wanders back in a 
dream of delight, 
Th the old rustic bridge by the mill. (Chorus)

I'm Lonely Since I 
Lost My Tom. 
Written by FRED HATFIELD, and sang with great success by 
r 
D &N. IVIcCA.tany in his Celebrated Sketch entitled 
The Irish Fair. 
Bad luck to Bergh and the City Fathers, 
And the blackguards that made up that law, 
They can't find its equals from here to Chicago, 
Or from there, my boys, to Arkansaw; 
I 
had. a 
cat, ho was a 
daisy, 
Hig color was gray, he was two foot long, 
I'd. give ten dollars if I 
could collar 
The sucker that stole away my Tom. 
Cnonus: 
He was a 
darling, he sang so charming 
In our back yard the whole night long, 
I'd go without my supper to catch that sucker 
Who went and stole away my Tom. 
He bate the cat of McNally, 
He was the champion of our back yard, 
He ran ap-ainst Mrs. Duffy in Farin's Alley, 
And gave the poor soul a 
very bad fall; 
He was thrown from a 
roof and turned ten times over 
He was poisoned twice now, sure that's wrong, 
But the cat-catchers caught him, and away they 
brought him, 
Sure I'm lonely since I 
lost my Tom. 
My old woman saw young Michael Kelly 
With our Tommy in his arms, 
But he being the son of a 
good, old neighbor, 
She didn't think that he meant any harm; 
But she heard he sold him for a 
quarter, 
To a 
cat-catcher by the name of Long, 
But if I 
catch that snoo2er, you may bet that I'll 
bruise him, 
For I'm lonely since I 
lost my Tom.

Young people all, both great and small, come listen to my 
news, 
It is a 
song I'm going to sing of the murder in Cohoes; 
When Catherine Dunsbaeh, the victim, was slain in her 
house, you all know, 
And Latrimouille he murdered her, and soon to the gal-
lows he'll go. 
Next day the people they all knew, when the Coroner 
spread the news, 
That Latrimouille had murdered her and gone out of 
Cohoes; 
No one saw him murder her, it was all between them both, 
But the Doctor soon examined her, and said he'd cut her 
throat. 
He walked along t•he street so mild, and was in the best of 
cheer, 
He walked down into Shep's saloon and called for a 
glass 
of beer; 
They viewed his hat, his shirt, his pants, his coat, his vest, 
his shoes, 
And he was at the mercy of the policeman in Cohoes. 
And soon the detectives followed him all around the coun-
try and back, 
They arrived at Port Henry, and found him in a 
black-
smith shop; 
They brought, him back to Cohoes Jail, where he was 
guarded well, 
They shut the door and locked him up in a 
murderer's 
dark cell. ,

For three long months he lay in jail and no one could he . 
see, 
Except his father and his mother and a 
Priest from Albiny; 
He chewed and smoked the whole day long, and at night 
fell on his knees, 
And begged the Lord to pardon him for all his wicked 
deeds: 
The morning of his trial he grieved till his heart was sore, 
To hear the witnesses of Cohoes how hard on him they 
t / 
swore; 
Some did their duty ncbly, before our blessed Lord, 
While others shouted, hang him, or we'll lose a 
big reward. 
The morning after his trial, as you can plainly see, 
The Jury Went into a 
back room, and sool they did agree; 
The Jury found him guiity, and the Judge made this reply: 
On the twenty-ninth of August you are. condemned to die. 
For seven long weeks he lay in jail, and all this time he 
hoped 
That he might gain his liberty before he saw the rope; 
But now my days are end d, I 
hid you all farewell, 
It's in my a

Singing your song so glad.

Never again well sorrow,

Leaving the land of sorrow, 
Leaving your heart so true; 
You were my guardian angel, 
Bidding me not repine; 
The clouds are rolling by, Jennie, •

Never again repine; 
The clouds are rolling by, Jennie,

Give the back my heart again, 
I'll forget the happy past; 
You have caused me grief and pain, 
Shadows o'er my pathway cast; 
Life to me was once so bright, 
Ahl I 
dreamt Would so remain, 
But my hopes have vanished quite, 
Give me back my heart again, 
But my hopes have vanished quite, 
Give me back my heart again. 
ClIORIIS: 
Give me back my heart again, 
I'll forget the happy past, 
You have caused me pain, 
Shadows o'er my path cvay cast; 
But my hop2s have vanished quite, 
Give me back my heart again. 
Give me back my heart again, 
Now as strangers we must meet, 
Others smiles will soon enchain, • 
Others lips thine own will greet; 
Go, forget the wrong you've done, 
Ne'er can I 
sweet peace regain, 
Though it is a 
broken one, 
Give me back my heart again.

There's an old-fashioned house in the old country, 
There's an old-fashioned couple live there; 
There's an old-fashotted gate by the old country road, 
And an old-fashioned man near the'chair. 
An old-fashioned woman is sitting there, 
Darning an old pair of hose; 
With her old fashioned cap on her old-fashioned head, 
And she's dressed in her old-fashioned clothes. 
Cnonus: 
Hear those bells, those merry bells, 
And they fill my soul with a 
thrill, 
'Tis the old-fashioned sound from those old-fashioned bells, 
In that old-fashioned church on the Liii, 
There's an old-fashioned clock on that old whitewashed 
With its old-fashioned pendulum and hands; [ wall, 
There's an old wooden bench by that old fireplace, 
With its bright copper kettles and pans. 
An old-fashioned man is sitting there, 
Smoking his old-fashioned clay, 
With his old favorite dog sitting close by his side, 
Watching the children at play. ( Chorus). 
Heaven bless that dear old pair, may they live so for years, 
In that dear little house in the lane; 
May they never know a 
care, but all happiness to share, 
And think of the dear old happy days. 
The same I 
wish to you, with a 
heart of conscience true, 
May you live, yes, for many, many years; 
May you never want for wealth, but enjoy the best of health, 
It is the earnest wish I 
give to you.

Grandpa's chair is vacant, 
Near the fire in the grate; 
Where he told his tales of boyhood, 
Kept the little ones awake. 
One eve, so worn and weary, 
Sleeping on his knees they lay, 
Death called that night, like the fire bright, 
Grandpa passed away. 
Cnouus. 
So let the room be cheerful, 
Place the old arm chair 
Where we talked to Grandpa, 
With his silvery snow white hair. 
How he'd watch the falling ashes, 
And sadly meditate, 
Gently sigh. we all mast die, 
Like the. fire in the grate. 
One bitter night in winter, 
The snow fell fast and wild; 
A 
girl looked in the window, 
A 
careworn, hapless child; 
Then Grandpa whispered " baby," 
And toddled to the gate,

To save from in, he brought her in, 
Near the fire in the grate.

Kind friends and companions were near, 
A merry and mirth- loving throng, 
With links of relationship dear, 
To bind us life's pathway along. 
I 
saw the sweet smile that you wore, 
As we gazed on the friends that we knew; 
I 
heard the same voice as of yore, 
That told of a 
bosom so true. 
And long did that pleasure remain, 
And joyous each spirit did seem; 
Oh, vision return once again, 
Or quickly fulfilled be the dream.

To toy brother, it was found, she had left a 
hundred pounds, 
The same unto my sister I 
do declare,

see, 
She has lett to you her " Old arm-chair."

And how they titter'd, how they chaff'd, 
How my brother and sister langli'd,

Granny had only left to me her old arm chair. 
I 
thought it hardly fair, still I 
said I 
did not care, 
And in the ev'ning took the chair away, 
The neighly ,rs they me chatni, my brother at me laugh'd 
And said it would be useful Jobe, some day. 
When you settle d 
twit in life find some girl to be your wife, 
You'll find it very handy, I 
declare. 
On a 
cs,ld and frosty night when the fire is burning bright, 
You can then sit in your old arm chair. 
And how they titter'd, etc. 
What my brother said came true, for in a 
year or two, 
Strange t say I 
sealed down in married life, 
I 
first the girl did cfart, and then the ring I 
bought, 
took her to church and when she was my wife, 
The old girl and me, were as happy as- could be, 
For when my work was over I 
declare, 
I 
ne'er abroad would roam brit each night would stay a' home, 
And be seated in my old arm chair. 
And how they titter'd, etc. 
One night the chair fell down, when I 
pick'd it up I 
found, 
The seat hid laden out upoo the floor. 
And the

saw before my eyes,

And there is no use for to try.

Ohoi yeho, ho yeho, who's for the ferry

And I'll row ye so quick, and 111 row ye so steady, 
And ' tis but a 
penny to Twickenham to Am. 
The ferryman's slim, and the ferryman's young, 
And he's just a 
soft twang in the turn of his tongue, 
And he's fresh as a

And ' tis but a 
penny to Twickenham town. 
Ohoi yeho, ho yeho, " Pin for the ferry" 
(The briar's in bud, the sun going down), 
And it's late as it is, and I 
haven't a 
penny, 
And how shall I 
get me to Twickenham town? 
She'd a 
roe in her bonnet, and oh, she look'd sweet 
As the little pink flower that grows in the wheat, 
With her cheeks like a 
rose and her lips like a 
cherry, 
" 
And sure and you're welcome to Twickenham town." 
Ohoi yeho, ho! you're too late for the ferry 
(The briar's in bud, the sun going down), 
And he's not rowing quick, and he's not rowing steady-
You'd think ' twas a 
journey to Twickenham town. 
" 
Ohoi and Oho," you may call as you will, 
The moon is a

And with love like a

There's danger in crossing to Twickenham town.

blow, 
I'll give you one, one as true as ever yet .was told; 
For mates I 
wouldn't lie about the dead—no not for gold. 
The story's of a 
maid and lad who loved in days gone by; 
The maiden was Meg Anderson, and the lad, messmates, 
was I, 
A 
neater, trimmer craft than ,Meg was very hard to find; 
Why, she could climb a 
hill and make five knots agin the 
wind; 
And as for larnin' bulks and spars, lye often heard it said 
That she could give the scholars points, and then come 
out ahead. 
The old schoolmaster used to say, and mates it made me cry, 
That the smartest there was little Meg; the greatest dunce 
was I. 
But what cared I 
for larnin' then, while she was by my 
side? 
For though a 
lad, I 
loved her, mates, and for her would 
have died; 
And she loved me, the little lass, and often have I 
smiled 
When she said: " I'll be your little wife," 'twas the prattle 
of a 
child; 
For there lay a 
gulf between us mates, with the waters 
ruruting high 
On one side stood Meg Anderson, on the other side stood I. 
Meg's fortune was twelve ships at sea, and houses on the 
land, 
While mine—why, mates, you might have held my fortune 
in your hand, 
Her father owned a 
vast domain for miles along the shore, 
My 
father owned a 
fishing-smack, a 
hut and nothing more. 
I 
knew that Meg I 
ne'er could win, no matter how I'd try, 
For on a 
couch of down lay she, on a 
bed of straw lay I. 
I 
never thought of leaving Meg, or Meg of leaving me, 
For we were young and never -dreamed that I 
should go 
to sea, 
Till one bright mornin' father said: " There's a 
whale ship 
in the bay, 
I 
want you, Bill, to make a 
crtiise—you go aboard to- day." 
Well, mates, in two weeks from that time, I 
bade them 
all good-bye, 
While on the dock stood little Meg, and on the deck stood I. 
I 
saw her oft, before we sailed, whene'er I 
came on shore, 
And she would " 
Bill, when you're gone, I'll love you 
more and more, 
And I'll promise to be true to you through all the coming 
years," 
But while she spoke, her bright blue eyes would fill with 
pearly tears. 
Then, as I'd whisper words of hope, and kiss her eyelids 
dry, 
Her last words were: " God speed you, Bill." 
So parted 
Meg and I. 
Well, mates, we cruised for four long years, till at last 
one summer's day, 
Our good ship—the Minerva—cast anchor in the bay. 
arAtairi.. 
LITTLE MEG AND I 
—CONTINeED. 
57 
Oh! how my heart beat high with hope, as I 
saw her home 
once more, 
And on the pier stood hundreds, to welcome us ashore; 
But my heart sank down within me as I 
gazed with anx-
ious eye, 
No little Meg stood on the dock, as on the deck stood I. 
Why, mates, it nearly broke my heart when I 
went ashore 
that day, 
For they told me that Meg had married, while I 
was far 
away. 
They told me too, they'd forced her to't, and wrecked her 
fair young life. 
Just think, messmates, a 
child in years, to be an old man's 
wife. 
But her father said it must be done, and what could she i 
reply? 
For she was only just sixteen, just twenty-one was I. 
;Well, mates, a 
few short years from then—perhaps it might' 
be four, 
One blustering night, Jack Glint' and I 
were rowing to 
the shore, 
When right ahead we saw a 
sight that made. us. hold our 
breath— 
There, floating in the pale moonlight, was a 
woman cold 
in death. 
I 
raised her up: Oh! God! messmates, that I 
bad passed 
her by, 
For in the bay lay little Meg, and over her stood I.

BONal. Tambo, I 
know a 
man who am de mos' absent-
minded nigger I

TAMBO. Why, Bones, what did de nigger do ? 
BONES. Well, de udder night he undressed for bed,

back oh de chair, and hung dar until mornin'. 
TAMBO. Why, Bones, dats no circumstance to my brud-
der; he's de berry worst I

BONES. What did your brudder do ? 
TAMBO. Why, de udder night he was writin' a 
note to 
his gal, wid a 
lead-pencil, an' he wanted to say somethin' 
berry sweet; he laid down de pencil for a 
moment to re-
flect; as soon as de idea struck him, he took up his finger 
instead ob de pencil, an' did not discober de mistake until 
he began to sharpen it. 
BONES. Dat's Luffin' to my cousin. 
TAMBO. Why not ?

Well, he was 
eatin' his dinner, and was lookin' ober de Herafr..Z. 
An' 
would you believe it, Tambo, he wiped his mouf wid de 
newspaper, an' commenced to peruse the napkin, an' de 
joke of it was, he didn't discober his mistake until he 
went to tear the corner off de napkin to light his cigar! 
TAMBO. That's no worse than a 
gal I 
once had. 
BONES. How's that ? 
TAMBO. I 
took her home to her parents' mansion one 
night, and when we reached de house she rapped on my 
face, an' bid de door good-night. 
I'M PROUD I'M AN IRISHMAN'S SON, 
Copyrighted 18S2 
by F. 
P. 
ANDERSON. Written, composed, and sung 
by DAN NASH. 
Music and Words published by FRANK P. 
ANDERSON, 33 Court St., 
Brooklyn, N. 
Y. 
If I 
was a 
son of old England 
I'd praise the dear land of my birth ; 
If the mountains of Scotland had brought me to light 
I'd cherish their beauty and worth ; 
But my heart fondly beats for old Itcland, 
And the glorious deeds she has done, 
Till the day that I 
die I'll hold my head high, 
For I'm proud I'm an Irishman's son. 
CnoRCTS. 
So I'll think with a 
smile of the Emerald Isle, 
I'll remember the deeds she has done, 
While my heart is unfurled I 
will say to the world, 
I'm proud I'm an Irishman's son. 
They may treat me with scorn and derision, 
They may bring the hot tear in my eye, 
They may say with a 
sneer when employment I 
seek, 
That an Irishman need not apply. 
When I 
think of' the heroes old Ireland's produced, 
And the glorious deeds they have done, 
I'll still play my part, and I'll say from my heart, 
I'm proud I'm an Irishman's son. 
When I 
think of such heroes as Emmett, 
Who died without one moment's pause, 
Likewise Patrick Sarstield exiled from his land, 
Lamenting the good of the cause. 
When I 
think of such statesmen as Grattan and Burke, 
The respect and the honor they won, 
I'll never deny the land of my birth, 
For I'm proud I'm an Irishman's son. 
When I 
think of such poets as Goldsmith, 
Likewise the famous Tom Moore, 
Their poems and prose are renowned through the world, 
And well they deserve it, I'm sure. 
When I 
think of the great Dan O'Connell, 
The brightest gem under the sun, 
You'll admit, it is true, what more c.,n 
I 
do 
But be proud I'm an Irishman's son.
