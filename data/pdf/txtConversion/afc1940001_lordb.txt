Lord BakemanIn India there lived a noble lord,And he had houses of high degree,But there he never
could be contentedUntil he had been a voyage at sea.Then he sailed east and he sailed west,Until
he came to the Turkish shore.And there he was taken and put in prisonWhere he could neither see
nor hear.The jailor had an only daughter,And she was a lady fair to see.She had stole the keys to
her father's prison,And she said Lord Bakeman she would set free.When she came to the prison
gate,She opened it without delay,And stealing through its lonely way,Soon came to where Lord
Bakeman lay. *She had pleaded with a cruel father.Her pleadings, alas, were all in vain;There on the
cold damp prison floor,Lord Bakeman lay in cruel chains. *"If you have lands, if you have money,And
have you money of high degree, **What will you give to the fair ladyIf she will from bondage set you
free?""Oh, I have houses and I have money,And I have houses of high degree;All these I give to the
fair ladyIf she'll from bondage set me free.""Not for your silver or your gold,Nor yet your houses of
high degree;I do not want them," said the lady,"But all I crave is your fair body.""Then we'll make a
bargain, and we'll make it strong:For seven long years that it shall endThat you won't wed no other
woman,And I won't wed no other man." 2 2 of 3Lord BakemanWhen seven long years were at an
end,When seven long years had passed and gone,She packed up all her richest clothing,Saying,
"Now I'll go and seek my friend."Then she sailed east and she sailed west,Until she came to the
India shore.And there she never could be contented,Until for Lord Bakeman she did inquire.At every
corner of the street,She did inquire for Lord Bakeman's palace."Yes, yes," replied a brisk young
porter,"He and his bride have just stepped in."She wrung her hands, she tore her hair,Just like a lady
in despair."Alas; I wish I was in my native land,Across the seas there to remain."Take a message to
your noble lord.Tell him to send one ounce of bread,And a bottle of his wine so strong,And ask if
he's forgot the ladyWho set him free from his prison chains."The porter hastened to his lord,"A lady
sent me in to thee,Or else my eyes have seen a vision,"Unto Lord Bakeman thus spake he. *"There
is a lady stands at your gate,And she does weep most bitterly.I think she is the finest creatureThat
ever I wish my eyes to see."She wants you to send one ounce of bread,And a bottle of your wine
so strong,And ask if he's forgot the ladyWho set him free from his prison chains."He stamped
stomped so loud upon the floor,He broke the table in pieces three."Here's adieu, adieu, my wedded
bride,For this fair one I'll go and see."Then up spoke his new bride's mother,And she was a lady of
high degree."It is you have married my only daughter,[ " ?][?]But she is none the worse for me. [?]

3 3 of 3Lord Bakeman"Your daughter came with a horse and saddle;She shall return with a coach
and three.Here's adieu, adieu my wedded bride,For this fair one, I'll go and see." ***He took her by

fair,She is now called the wife of Lord Bakeman.
