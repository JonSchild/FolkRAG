Andrew Moore: In the number of capacities. So whether it's, whether it's government advocacy 
or educational programs, networking, communications, you know, that's, that's everything that we 
do on behalf of the industry and I can elaborate on that, or that could be a question later. I'm not 
sure.  
EK: But no, it can be. I mean, you can, because that was really like, that's what we wanted you to 
talk about, like what, how did the pilots benefit from NAAA about half of them that we've talked 
to? Well, most of them don't belong or they say they did belong and they don't any longer or a 
couple of them said, I'd like to but I don't want to spend the money. But it's very clear to me that 
like, most structures that support an industry and I'm thinking about like being a member of NEA, 
as a teacher, they you still advocate for them. You know, you're still fighting for them. And so, 
what, what, what is there, how do you benefit this industry? Like, what are you doing on a day-to-
day basis to make this function? Because these pilots can't do this alone, they think they are, but 
they're not. 
AM: Right. And you know, that goes into all these, all the different areas. But I mentioned that just 
start with government advocacy. We, look my background is in public policy so although I've been 
with NAAA for, since 1997. So, almost a quarter of a century I started as their director of legislative 
and regulatory affairs. And my background before that was as a staffer on, for a member of 
Congress that handled agricultural, transportation, environmental issues. Before that, I worked at 
United Fresh, I've represented the fruit and vegetable industry as a federal lobbyist and my 
background, my educational background’s and public policy. I also have an MBA, but that came 
later when I started to get into association management, but my, my background is, my family's 
background as we, we've been farming for four generations now in the valley of California.  
EK: Which Valley now? 
AM: San Joaquin, Valley Central Valley, California just outside of Bakersfield, California.  
EK: I in another lifetime I drove a truck and we went to California to pick up, you know, fruits and 
vegetables, hauled meat west and then brought produce back. So I'm pretty familiar with the area.  
 
AM: Yeah. So I grew up working on our ranch, we grew, we grow. Our main crop is potatoes. We 
also grow navel oranges, pistachios, almonds. Anyhow, the, that's my background. So, eventually in 
‘97, I was hired by NAAA became the executive or the CEO in 2002. But one of the main reasons. 
Was because of my public policy background and what we've done, what we do. It, probably one of 
the most important things that we do is what we have relationships with people that work at the 
regulatory agencies, whether it's USDA or EPA or the FAA. ‘Course, the FAA covers the aviation 
aspect. The EPA covers the pesticide-related issues and, and then Congress as well, the relations, 
relationships with members of Congress in those committees of jurisdiction that, that affect our 
issues. 
EK: Right. 
AM:  Including Ways and Means which is, you know, taxes affect us as well. So but probably one of 
the biggest issues for us is a regulation that Congress enacted called the Federal Insecticide 
Fungicide and rodenticide act also known as FIFRA. So yeah, FIFRA row is responsible for the 
registration of ever, it gives EPA the authority to register pesticides, whether their rodenticides or 
even bathroom cleaners, or insecticides, herbicides, fungicides rodenticides. You name it. So, but 
every 15 years and what EPA has to do then is they have to, they test for a, for its dietary safety. 
Like, when we consume it, of course. It's environmental safety, like its effects. How does this affect 
the water? How does this impact even endangered and threatened species? And occupational as 
well. So if you're putting this out, how is it, you know, the worker is, the worker protection. So they 
ensure that it is safe and develop label language. So when you buy, you know, you're whatever you 
want to spray your roses because you started to see some aphids or whatever, you'll see a long 
packaging list on the, it's kind of connected to the label. So they develop label language on how it's 
best used to protect yourself. Whether you're wearing protect, personal protection equipment, 
gloves, some cases. It can be some if you're mixing, loading larger, doses of crop protection 
product, that you might have to wear some sort of mask, et cetera. So EPA's testing under the 
jurisdiction for the safety of pesticides and how they're used. So we work with them to provide 
data on how pesticides are used in the field in the aerial application field. Uh, drift reduction 
technologies that we use. I'm not sure how much you spoke to other folks about that, but it gets it 
gets into a lot of different physics.  
[00:06:55] 
EK: Right. It came up in every interview. 
AM: Yes. So it's, it's, you know, make sure like EPA will say, we'll say to the EPA, if you look at our 
statistics, we have probably a hundred percent of our members are using GPS. Global positioning 
satellites, that is the hundred a percent. So that's going to work to prevent overspray. That's going 
to work to prevent drift of a product because you don't want the product to move from one field 
into another. If it's a herbicide and cause damage, or if there's workers in the other field or if 
there's something else nearby.  
EK: Bees. They talked about bees quite a bit.  
AM: Bees. Yeah, there's, there's exactly. I mean there's rules on EPA write, drafts labels to protect 
bees from certain products. Mostly insecticides. Not so much. You know, fungicides. 
EK: How do you, how do you collect your data? Do you get it directly from pilots? 
AM: We do annual surveys. So, or not annual surveys, we do, we do do kind of an economic survey 
every year, but we do a more comprehensive survey probably every five years. Where we’re 
asking our members, or not just members by the way. We're asking those in the industry, pilots 
and operators and I say operators those are the business owners. And sometimes they're both like 
a business owner will also be the pilot. In fact, 87 percent seven percent of our members, I'm sorry 
about our operators are also ag pilots.  
EK: When you say when you say our operators are, is that just members or is that just like the two 
to three thousand ag pilots? 
AM: It’s industry wide. Yeah, it’s industry wide. Sometimes I use them interchangeably but what I 
mean is industry wide per survey. Eighty-seven percent of our business owners are also pilots. 
Then, so the totals, I think the total number of pilots is about 3,400. 
EK: Oh, okay. 
AM: And the total number of operations is 1500, 1560. According to our 99, I'm sorry, 2019 
survey. 
EK: So, so are the the pilots, are they is that a separate number from the operators, do you 
consider operators somebody like Hinen brothers in Kansas like who who have like you know, like 
a contingent of pilots who fly for them, is an operator them, or is the operator like, like another 
pilot? Or a co op? 
[00:10:01] 
AM: No, an operator is the business owner so, so it would be the Hinen brothers would be the 
operator. So we have 1,560 of those businesses?  
EK: Okay. 
AM: Well you asked a good question because they have, they own a number of businesses. So they 
own a number of different aerial application businesses. So, so with the Hinen brothers, that 
includes that 1,560 includes, a number that are from the Hinen brothers.  
EL: Okay, I'm just trying to get kind of an understanding because I mean, obviously there aren't 
that many ag pilots in the country, and, and they don't even know how many of them there are. 
You know, like one guy'll say 2,000 and somebody else will say oh that's too high or no, that's too 
low. And so they don't even know. And, and so, we've been unable to like really get a grasp of the 
size of the industry. So what you're telling us is great. I mean, we're just like hungry for this part.  
AM: I could get you a copy of our survey. I mean, like, this might be more of the oral interview 
compilation, but yeah, we can provide you with that survey.  
EK: That would be fascinating.  
AM: Yeah, that's not a problem. But it is, when you look at the 87% of the 1,560 operators. And, 
and then we have about 2.3 aircraft per operation. It's going to give you a figure of about 3,400 ag 
pilots in the United States.  
EK: Okay. 
AM: So, so I kind of left off on the EP on the on the regulatory stuff.  
EK: Yeah, that’s okay.  
AM: Do you want me to continue on that end or elaborate on something else? 
EK: It, you know, it just raises more questions.  
AM: Let me, I’m sorry, go ahead. 
EK: No, this is your talk, not mine. 
AM: Well, I was just going to say so from, you asked, you know, where does that information come 
from? We do those surveys about every five years and we're asking the number of acres on 
average our, our aerial applicators would treat per day per aircraft. We’re asking what kind of drift 
reduction technologies they use. We're asking them, do they use a closed loading-mixing system? 
And so we have these statistics and we’re able to communicate to the EPA when they're 
registering products, some of the risk reduction, the many of the risk reduction member risk 
reduction efforts will take. So say the EPA was concerned about a worker exposure issue for a 
certain insecticide. And they said, well, we, our theoretical estimates show that you have, you’re 
treating. 3,000 Acres a day per aircraft, so that's going to put the mixer-loader, and we have 
members showing concerns to the mixer loaders. Well, we'll look at our survey and show that No, 
the, the average number of acres treated per day for insecticides is 1,300 acres, not 3,000 acres. 
EK: Right. When you said that, I thought, you know, that's a lot in one day. 
AM: Yeah, well, I mean, I'm just sometimes, you know, they come up with theoretical estimates, 
you know, that fine, we're in communication with them. Just trying to straighten out and get the 
most accurate risk assessment as possible. Or we’;; say well, okay, if there still is a margin of 
exposure, what if we, you know, we can easily, say, require on the label that a closed contained 
mixing-loading system must be used. So you’re closing it as you mix it so you're not getting 
exposure. Or a dry hose where you're locking the hose and there's no risk of blocking the hose on 
the mixing-loading tank that connects to the aircraft. So you're going to mitigate exposure there or 
require more personal protection equipment. So, those are the kind of things if there's, we would 
not be able to do our job. If? These pesticides were not registered for use. Well, let me, a lot of 
what we do is spraying pesticides. We also put out fertilizers and cover crops and seeds and so 
forth but… So registering these products and it's required that EPA every 15 years has to go 
through this process. So say it's kind of like the seventeen-year-old cicadas, right? I don't love your 
having cicadas where you are right now.  
EK: Not yet. 
AM: They're awesome. I love magic cicadas. But nevertheless, you know, they only come out every 
17 years, right? Or this particular brood? So, similarly, the food quality protection act, which 
amended FIFRA, requires that pesticides, be re-registered every 15 years. So, basically, your, your 
registration expires, if you will, I guess it's kind, and then you have to go through all that testing 
again that occupational, exposure, that dietary, that environmental, that water testing because 
more information comes up over 15 years time. More tests are done, whether they’re chronic or  
acute on the effects, on the effects. So that's always, they’re always held up to you know, those 
health and environmental standards. So we're always involved in that process of registering those 
crop protection products.  
EK: So does this for,… 
AM: For aerial use. 
EK: Okay, so does this enable pilots to just carry on, you know because I dare say they have no clue 
what you do. I mean we were at a, we were at a an airport yesterday at the hangar of one of our 
pilots that we've been reviewed and his, they were the chemicals were sitting there and they were 
like, you know, getting ready to load up for another pass. And I just, and I knew we were going to 
talk to you and I and I thought have you stood here where I am standing and I'm not challenging 
you, but, or have, has the EPA, I mean, how do they really know what's going on? I guess is the 
question.  
AM: So you’re asking me, have I gone to, do I go to different operations? 
EK: Well no, I mean what you're doing is like incredibly important to allow pilots to do their job 
but does the EPA or does anybody in Washington really know what these guys are doing? You 
know the reality of standing on a runway watching somebody load their plane? And that's I, I'm 
just curious, you know? I mean just kind of in general? Because like these things are really 
important but how much do they matter to the pilots I guess, you know, in their day-to-day life? Is 
is that an unfair question for you? 
AM: No, well I mean I'll answer, first of all one of the things we do in, with advocacy you know we 
started on advocacy of policy issues, right? 
EK: Right. 
AM: So one of the things that we do is we educate. I mean basically it's education. It's not, really, 
the different than what, I mean we're doing similar... We're educating. 
EK: Okay. 
AM: You're educating one way. I'm educating. Policymakers about our industry and sometimes 
yes, it does, it does. We do have literally field trips. So we will take policymakers from the EPA's 
office of pesticide program say, or from the FAA and also Congressional staff to local operations, 
local here.  
EK: That’s smazing thing. That's really neat that you do that.  
[00:20:01] 
AM: Yeah. And it gets expensive and but, but we will do that. We probably do that every year we 
work with other, you know the other thing about policy is you try to build a coalition. So we 
coalesce with a lot of different ag groups, agricultural groups, whether it's the Farm Bureau, or 
agricultural retailers, or corn growers, cotton growers, you name ‘em. Yeah, to put on these field 
days. We, and like for the past four years of except for ‘19, I think we did it in, I'm sorry ‘20, we did 
it in ’19, ‘18, ‘17, ‘16. We worked with the association of equipment manufacturers. So they're the 
ones that are the build, like they might be the Case or the John Deere's, you know, that build 
harvesters and tractors and... And we had a, we have a field day in the eastern shore of Maryland, 
which is just across the Bay Bridge, or even closer into Southern Maryland, just across the 
Potomac, not just across, but a little further south, but to put on these field days and we'll bus in 
these policymakers and just show them how things work.  
EK: Are they amazed? 
AM: I think so. I think they like to get out, you know. And we have an unfortunately, I haven't had 
one this year either all, the all because of the pandemic. So we'll be back at that. We're actually 
looking at having one, and it's tentatively scheduled for Columbus Day, but we're actually going to 
bring the equipment onto the mall and it's going to be close to USDA and that way not only would, 
you have USDA folks going, their Congressional staff, very close, EPA is their office of pesticide 
programs has moved. They used to be in Crystal City Virginia. Now they've moved back to DC. So 
and then he'd have it also open for the public to look at the education. So there is yes, there is a lot 
of that and we have state associations as well. That do a lot of policy work, they'll do some policy 
work at the state level that put on similar programs. The Texas Ag Aviation Association, the 
Arkansas Ag Association, the California Agricultural Aircraft Association. They have, they ‘re 
bigger states in terms of numbers of aerial application businesses. So they have more robust staff 
to do that type of work. 
EK: We live in Missouri. We actually live on the farm, my husband's farm, family farm. It's been in 
his family since the mid-1800s. So, and that is at the, it's like really what sparked this interest. 
Because one of our buddies is the ag pilot who serves most of the area around here and we love it 
when, you know, he flies over the house and stuff. So the things you're talking about were very 
familiar with, you know, as far as the terminology and stuff. Just yeah. 
AM: Well there's also a Missouri Association. It's a smaller one. But Kansas, they all have there's a 
lot of different state and regional associations. And so you know, I think one of the questions that 
was brought up earlier was like, how do we, how do we know them? Well, we do have, I got, when 
I travel I'll go to different operations and I understand you, having worked in the industry for 25 
years. I'm always learning, we're always learning but, and we're always evolving as an industry 
very much so, but so that helps me obviously in this, worthwhile to me To better educate, you 
know, to have that hands-on experience. In terms of knowing who they are, meaning the 
businesses and the pilots., as I said, we have a, a different state and regional associations that 
we’re very close with. In fact, they actually belong to us, the NAAA the National Agricultural 
Aviation Association, and they, they make up our board so they are able to send a board, you 
know. They decide who their board member is and they will send them to our different board 
meetings to make policy. 
[00:25:11] 
EK: Which is how you know, Sam Styron. 
AM: That's how I know Sam. Yes. And, but, so I think Sam does most of his work in Kansas but lives 
in no, he lives in Kansas but does most of his work in Missouri.  
EK: No. The other way around. He lives in Harrisonville Missouri and which is just like, it's just 
off… 
AM: And he does most of his work in Kansas or at least used to. 
EK: Right. Yes because it's just, you know, like 12 miles away. 
AM: Right. So you know we, they'll share directories with us like whose a member of Missouri, so 
we know and we can see if they're interested in belonging. It's all volunteer as you know, most 
associations are volunteer. So when we probably have third of our members, a third of the 
industry probably belong.  
EK: Yeah, the website said 1,600. I don't know how up to date that… 
AM: That's about right? Yeah, I mean it's a moving number, but yeah that's about right and if, but 
bear in mind that some of those members are also allied industries so they're the aircraft 
manufacturers ,or crop protection product, manufacturers or insurance companies, parts and 
equipment. You know, service providers to the operation. 
EK: I was reading some of Jay’s, I guess they’re articles that have been published. I was reading 
some of his articles about different topics that are like, link, you know they're on the website and I 
realized that it's not just pilots and you know that it's a broder, which brings me to another 
question. Do you what, like the demographic of the membership, are the younger pilots, who are 
probably maybe better educated may have even have a, you know, advanced college degrees, are 
they are they like, becoming more I guess vocal in in AAA? Are they, are there, jas the demographic 
of membership changed? I guess is the question.  
AM: It's changed a little bit, you know. The, the average, what, I'll answer that through our survey 
question. There's a, each, like if you're in the industry as a pilot, you have about 20 years of 
experience in the industry. So, and if you're an operator on business owner, an aerial application 
business owner, you have about 30 years of experience, so it tends to be an older more 
experienced industry. However, in our last survey, it was the young, the, the demographic that 
grew the most was the younger demographic.  
EK: We interviewed Emily Daniel and her husband, and he like, she's very safety-conscious and 
you know, talks, and I follow her on Instagram and she spends a lot of time, you know, just talking 
about safety issues and just, yeah, she's an amazing advocate for the industry.  
AM: Well, she is and she's really done a great job. She does a great job of social media, and she 
does a great job with, on trying to get operators and put our pilots to wear flight suits to, you 
know, in case there, you know, which prevents burns, you know. Can prevent burns.  
EK: She needs a, her dream is a pink one. [Laughter.] 
AM: We’ll look into that for Emily. 
EK: She would love you forever, I'm sure. 
AM: [Laughter.] Yeah, she's great. She's great. One other thing I was going to say just how we know 
about, in addition, to knowing, from the states, like they'll they might supply us with who operate, 
operators are and pilots are in their states. We, there's, you probably already learned this, but you 
have to have a FAA 137 certificate to make aerial applications legally. So that list is publicly 
available by the FAA. Now that's not necessarily going to have all the pilots, but it would have all 
the businesses, so that we use that to reach our reach, the industry too And bear in mind even 
though we, you know, we have, you know, if we only have a third of the industry as members, we 
still, if you look at our website and we have a quarterly magazine, all that information is provided 
to operators and pilots basically free of charge. I mean, we still send our magazine to all aerial 
application operators and pilots in which we have an address for. Because, you know, there's a, 
there's a, we go by the saying that upon the performance of each rests the fate of us all. So if we are 
reaching out to everybody with professional information on aviation safety, and good 
environmental stewardship, and securing operations, you know education goes a long way to you 
know, preventing the reach of, of regulators. And so that's that's, that's a big mantra of NAAA, what 
we do.  
[00:31:47] 
EK: So, so what is your, like, what do you do day to day?  
AM: Well, I do a lot of advocacy, you know, I'm in contact with our, with members of Congress. 
Like right now one of the issues… I saw you guys froze up, I don't know if you guys… Are we still 
connected?  
[Break in recording due to poor internet service. A new link had to be issued for the call 
and recording had to re-established] 
 
00:00:01 
EK 
 
There we go. So, 
                  
00:00:04 
AM 
 
what do I do on a daily basis? Yeah, yes. Yeah. The so, a lot of what I do is policy advocacy. So I'm in 
contact with regulators, and Congressional staff and members of Congress on a number of 
different issues that were working on, whether it's registration of protection products, one of the 
things that we're dealing and when I say crop protection products, that's Besides the the other 
thing that we're working on is right now, you probably heard a lot on in the news about a, an 
infrastructure bill that's being looked at. So one of the one of the issues that's of concern to us as 
an industry are obstacles and wires like towers and wires. You know, we're flying literally 10. Feet 
off the ground, making an application and went early. Wouldn't turbines wind turbines are are 
easier to see but tough to maneuver around but a lot of some towers are very thin or not very 
wide. You know, wind turbine is You know, you've seen those are usually white and large visual, 
you know, you can visualize them and they're usually obviously over 200. Anything over 200 feet, 
has to be has to be reviewed and usually is marked, like, either mark by lights or Aviation and 
orange white, where Aviation orange and white painting, right? Or the guide wires, the wires that 
connect will. We'll have some sort of fluorescent ball on it or something like that in order for them 
to be seen. So you can see kind of the angle, the trajectory of the wire. But a lot of towers, the 
towers under 200 feet aren't required to go through that hazardous review by the FAA. And so, 
but in 2018, we were able to see legislation Enacted that we're waiting for Congress to monetary. 
We're waiting for the FAA to release in a draft form, but we requires marking and logging of the 
location of towers under 200 feet that are in rural areas that are 10 feet or less in diameter. 
Because those are the ones that are really hard to see. Now, we we, when we fought this, this for 
this issue back and we were fighting for it from basically 2005 for almost fifteen, thirteen years. It 
was a lot of meteorological evaluation towers are going up that were under 200 feet and they were 
there used to really see if an area is going to be effective for collecting WIN Energy. So they'll 
before they build the turbines, they put up these Your logical evaluation Towers. And they would 
go up overnight, they weren't Mark. They were under 200 feet and we had fatality sand. We've had 
fatality as, with other Towers to Communications Towers. When we push for this legislation. We 
had a lot of fight back from the communication industry, so they were able to not have the 
requirements to both log meaning. When I say log and it would require FAA to develop a database, 
right? The latitude and longitude where these towers are and then we can feed that into our GPS 
systems. And and it would require them also to mark. So communication industry came in and 
said now will we want to change so that we're just doing one? Not both which probably means 
they just do the logging. But we're continuing to push for logging and marking of these towers and 
you know, they're one of the main one of the components of the infrastructure bill is is for Rural 
Broadband so to help your signal but but no. So you know if so we're going at it we're taking 
another shot at this to see if we can Expand the requirements that they be marked and lit. So that's 
that's one of the issues that were also dealing with in addition to Working with EPA and 
registering products. We're working on Tower safety issues and wire marking Those are some of 
our policy advocacy issues. Why 
                  
00:05:24 
EK 
 
is it? Why is it so difficult? I mean, it's very obvious watching these pilots fly that they need to 
know where these things are. I mean, you know, we see them fly over and they're 10 feet off the 
ground. Why why wouldn't you want to make this safer for an industry industry? I don't, I guess, I 
don't understand the politics of it. Well, 
                  
00:05:48 
AM 
 
that's a good question. They'll it comes down to cost and large part. Yeah, you know, having to 
Two. Paint all existing towers and mark them or put lights on them. They don't want the additional 
liability. I mean, that's something you'd have to ask them, but these are just these are they think 
it's not a high safety. High enough. Safety number that it's, it's It's not harming enough people. I 
mean, these are these are again, I'm somewhat speculating, but also I, we've been working this 
issue right with these communication 
                  
00:06:39 
EK 
 
so enough people haven't died. Yes, you'd have 
                  
00:06:46 
AM 
 
to ask them that but you know what I mean? That's what it's here. Yeah, here's interesting. You 
know, there was a fatal Tower accident with a meteorological evaluation Tower in 2011, AG pilot, 
and operated by the name of Steve Allen. And he, you know, he was flying into this area and the 
farmer didn't tell him that this Tower was there and he collided into it and was killed. And this is a, 
this was a meteorological evaluation Tower. So one that was checking whether perhaps for a, you 
know, for one of the turbines, right? Well, Karen Allen, his widow. Ended up suing the not only the 
farmer landowner and the Energy company in the tower company and ultimately there was a 6.7 
million dollar settlement in her favor. That was in. I believe that was in 2014 the settlement that 
the accident was in 2011, and in in 2016, we passed our legislation for marking. All these towers 
under 200 feet, then all of a sudden, the Communication Company kind of got caught off guard and 
we're like hey wait a minute, we're going to have a lot of towers of hours under this regulation so 
they were able to change the law quickly with in 2018 to get part of their industry out. Now, if 
there were a lot of and you God forbid no we don't want anybody to be the The sacrificial lamb in 
this case. But, you know, I could be an issue where they there isn't a lot enough liability concern 
for them to worry about. so, That's speculation, but it's a, it's a big industry and we're a Davey and 
their Goliath. And, you know, I guess we need to sharpen our stones or something. So get a more 
durable. Leather sling shot or something. But, but it's a challenge because we're a small industry, 
you know, that's something that's it. Word amazing industry. In that I think about it. There's only 
fifteen hundred and sixty operations, 2.3 Pilots / 2.3 aircraft per operation. But we're treating, you 
know, almost a third Twenty Eight percent of the crop land in the United States. Right? That's 
pretty. That's pretty significant, 
                  
00:09:51 
EK 
 
yes, it is, we're 
                  
00:09:52 
AM 
 
small. That's the thing. We don't have. We do important stuff and so that's another thing. That's 
another one of the things we're working on that I work on is work, we try to come up with 
Numbers economic numbers, that show the worth of our industry. The like I said, I mean, 
producing a third of our crops is not insignificant that doesn't even touch on pasture land. That we 
treat range land that we treat for, you know, livestock or dairy products, right? Livestock For very 
forestry, the forestry work. We do not just protecting forests for for Timber and what have you? 
But but forced firework, right? The whole public health aspects. So we're doing a lot of Mosquito 
Abatement few years back. You might recall and 17. There's that big zika virus break out. That was 
hitting the country and then you have West Nile, virus. A lot of encephalitis related diseases that 
are carried by mosquitoes that are deadly. And you know, our guys are in gals, are treating that. So 
so we're well that's another thing we work on. Try to come up with better economic numbers to 
make the case that we are vital and we do need to be that helps us with our advocacy right 
                  
00:11:29 
EK 
 
eye on the website that I was looking through the Educational the curriculum that had provided, 
that's really good stuff and I and what I guess, you know, like being in a high school for 30 years I 
thought, why wasn't that the egg Department? Because for it's got high school has a huge Ag 
Department. Why isn't this? You know, a point of study? Did they even know that this existed? So I 
think that Well, my thought was that somebody needs to go out into schools, you know and 
because because the things that you just listed, I don't think that there's an understanding 
generally that those yellow planes or thrush or whatever. Do more than just you know go over 
cropland. I don't think that I don't think they Stand the vastness of the application. So I don't know 
that that was just, we've gotten pretty protective of of the industry, I think in the course of these 
interviews and we're just like, we got it, what can we do about this? Well 
                  
00:12:54 
AM 
 
you're right. I mean and you know we we accomplished a lot. But here's the issue, you know, I 
mean, it's like the Chicken and the Egg, right? I mean, we need resources to do our job. We are a 
staff of six, that's 
                  
00:13:15 
EK 
 
all. We're 
                  
00:13:16 
AM 
 
a staff of six and we're, you know, representing an industry that treats, you know, third of the crop 
land. Everything I just mentioned and we've got to go up against some be hummus, you know, in 
with the communication industry. Well, even there's an active environmental lobby as well, but 
that fights against the registration of pesticides? And, you know, it's that's a whole other issue. We 
could spend an hour on is The Bennett, the environmental benefits of the judicious use of 
pesticides. I mean you're going to get it's clear that your yields like how many bushels you're going 
to get per acre of corn and soybeans and bales of hay and cotton and You know, way to potatoes, 
whatever per field by judiciously using pesticides, you're going to, you can see yield differences up 
to twenty percent if not more by utilizing modern agricultural practices, right there, just solely 
organic. Now, don't get me wrong, some of our members actually do organic treatment as well. 
They might pesticide applications with organic materials when 
                  
00:14:48 
EK 
 
I think, And that, right? They 
                  
00:14:50 
AM 
 
talk to you sugar or your water, okay? Well yeah, there's some different concoctions and even in 
the early days of our industry back when we started in the in the 20s you know it was you know 
sulfur dust was used to kill insects it was organic materials but again, you're not getting the eels. 
My point is all of a sudden if we didn't, if we went solely organic That's going to. Increase the 
number of Acres of Farmland you need right by at least at least 20%. And where is that Plum? 
Land it? Well it's in. It's in carbon sequestering forests. It's in water filtering Wetlands. It's in 
threatened and endangered species habitat. So we are in many respects Really doing more for. 
Four. You know. The environment an argument can be made. And so that's a whole other 
venomoth. We're up against is where I was going. We have the communications industry. We have 
activist groups and yeah, we're just a staff of six and I was the chicken and egg thing is, you know, 
we have people that you've talked to the don't even know we exist that are aerial applicators that 
our pilots and we need them. Why do we need them? Because Need their support. All right, we 
need their resources so we can fight these issues more effectively so it's a chicken and egg thing, 
you know. And then you know, we need we need more of our members involved. We need them 
better educated of what we do. So they know that they can they'll write us you know they'll give us 
the resources but they get a lot out of it. And you know, Just on having an inventory of products 
that they can use right. Probably the single most important thing but we fought for tax relief for 
them on fuels, we fought for preventing user fees. There's a big issue for user fees, takeoff and 
Landing fees for general aviation. That came up in the Obama Administration was in the Trump 
Administration was in the bush to It's it's, you know, if they had to pay $5 for every takeoff and 
Landing they made, when, or $100 one want administration, had $100 fee for each one, and you're 
putting out fertilizer, you can have, you know, fertilizer, you have, that's dry to drive materials 
spread and, you know, you cover a lot fewer acres per day. You can have up to 60 to 100 takeoffs 
and a day. Yes. A hundred times a hundred. Yeah. For user fee, if you're using a public airport, you 
know, I mean, probably fought against this. We fought against this. So these are other issues that 
we've worked on them. But it's and, you know, it's sometimes, it's tough to write that check, you 
know. Well, gosh, I can you know, I can buy a new pair of cowboy boots for my son ordered or I 
can we can go out to dinner tonight or or we can go into can go to is 401k or five my 529 College 
Plan you know I mean it's tough we all have expenses, you know I contribute to a couple of 
Charities myself and sometimes I skip again area, but because, you know, it's sometimes it's 
tougher than the not, but anyhow, I'm kind of Going off maybe on a tangent but no, I'm 
                  
00:19:17 
EK 
 
you're telling us really interesting things, you know, I, this is kind of what I thought at the 
beginning, that the pilots who aren't members, don't know, they just don't know and and not to 
slam them, but a lot of them aren't overly educated, you know, they and and they just, they just 
want to fly this way to fly but they don't really know. Why they get to you? No no, 
                  
00:19:49 
AM 
 
that's interesting. So there is another interesting thing that's forthcoming that may address the 
education aspect. So, you know, in addition to having your certification, you know, it are in 
addition to each area application business having to have that 137 certificate that I You guys know 
about. So every pilot has to be registered and approved as a commercial pesticide applicator, so, 
right? And there's 50 different state regulatory agencies that You have to go through to get that 
commercial pesticide. Authority, that would license certificate if you will. And, and the EPA has 
during, that's another area of EPA jurisdiction, they given the state's, those all 50 states the 
authority to regulate their own commercial operators. To commercial pesticide applicators. The 
few years back. They did, there was a regulation that passed. That requires. More specific 
regulatory, more specific education. And testing on the type of pesticide application that you do 
and one of those where you have to have. So so basically Usually you have to start like getting your 
license by taking a test, you pass a test right on the number of states. Most states, you just have to 
do continuing education. A number of you earn a certain number of units every year or every 
three years and that allows you to renew your license. Kind of like a driver's license, right? Unless 
you really screw up, you don't have to take the test, you know, some test some states, you have to 
take the test every five years, they just require right? Well, what the the EPA came out with a 
regulation, like I said, a few years back that it used to be that you could take a structural failure of 
an aerial applicator. All you had to take just a couple units, say to renew your your license, but it 
Been in. It could have been in structural pesticide use meaning you're you're treating insects like 
termites and a house. Okay, I took a termite in a house education class to continue my my 
pesticide application license even though I'm Ariel applicator. How does that help? You know, how 
are you? But what the new regulation is for the every state has to have an aerial category that 
education to con, you know, for the sea Use to renew licenses has to be related to that category. So 
that's one of the things that we do with our past program which is called a professional aerial 
applicator. Support system, we focus on drift mitigation, you know, environmental stewardship, 
right barbell. Professionalism, we focus on Aviation safety and we focus on security and so They 
will have to, we were the only ones that provide that pesticide education. We're the only. Only 
entity that provides pesticide education or the specific to into aerial applicators, right? So they will 
be seeing are currently I think more and more people will be able to see our curriculum and better 
understand. What all we're doing to benefit them. Yeah. And about a third of the industry takes 
that that programming every year. What more and more people having to take specific aerial 
application, pesticide education. I think you know that we might be able to reach everyone and 
first of all, I think that'll improve. Our accident numbers, I think that'll improve like reduce 
mitigator accident numbers, mitigate our drift incidences, and probably helped our association 
with with people understanding what we do and and coming forward. We're also, you know, it's 
our hundredth anniversary on August 3rd and so we're We've been really busy this year. Trying to 
where we're developing a whole new history book on the industry and Ice hardback book with 
with great illustrations, throughout the years, making that available to 2. The industry and where 
we have a big campaign, it's a public relations campaign where we've developed. I think you might 
have seen the video, the anniversary video on our website. You can, you can access that at are a 
gay, d--ation dot-org. Go to the 100 tab hundredth anniversary Tab and you can see our our 
documentary on the industry. But we're really spending a little extra money in reserves to reach a 
wider audience. And it's not just, you know, it's one thing that we don't reach, some of our own 
members are members of, you know, some of our own in the industry, right? The really big issue 
that's been a big issue for me since I started is how many people know about our industry or what 
they do know about us the reputation. It's always been, you know, kind of risk averse and our, you 
know, our Sorry, I'm more of a. It hasn't been the best. Stereotype right. And but you know, we've 
if you're around for a century especially today's scrutinizing society and social media and 
environmental Consciousness, you've got to be doing something right, all right? You got to be 
providing a very worthwhile service, you've got to be evolving technologically professional and 
we've been doing that and we're really trying to get that message out. The broader media, we 
really are doing all, we can hiring professional public relations professionals to, you know, get that 
information out to educate people, you know, right? We don't want this. This, whether it's Urban 
to rural divided, you know, we're trying to get this information out to educate. And and yeah, 
that's just been something that I feel we've done even with not having the budgets that we'd all 
like to have here. I think we've done a pretty good job on an advocacy, in the sense that we're still, 
we still have crop protection, products registered for aerial you. We do have some marking 
Provisions in the books. Now there's always more to do, we fought off user peas, we have good 
that attacks a fair tax program where you know we're not using the infrastructure Aviation 
infrastructure. Like a lot of A lot of our guys have their own Landing scripts, so they're not using 
either air traffic control and they're not using public airports that get airport Improvement 
program dollars in federal dollars. So as a result that's why we have an exemption from fuel taxes, 
right set because we're not using that infrastructure and we were successful in getting that similar 
to Farmers because farmers are there using fuel but it's on their field on necessarily on the 
highwomen. So it's very similar it's the same principle so we done a lot of good stuff from an 
advocacy standpoint. It's just really reaching reaching the public. Yeah, positive way myths, 
                  
00:28:41 
EK 
 
die hard to, you know, the myth of the crop duster, The Barnstormer, you know, taking risks and 
that myth dies hard. That's what most people think. One of our The guy who flies around us 
started out as a bull rider. And then, from there, he had a fencing company and then he decided he 
wanted to fly. So he systematically said about doing it. And but the people around here who know 
him, they think he's crazy. Well, he's not, you know, he's because he was a bull rider because he 
was a cowboy And they that like I said, the myth dies hard. That's that's what most people think 
about violets. Sadly it seems we know it's not true because they're back every day and if they were 
crazy they wouldn't be back every day. So one of the things, one of the things that we've heard 
repeated repeatedly in this project, is that That take take off. So optional an angel mandatory, 
right? Yeah. I had a question and probably going to be the last question because we've taken up 
enough of your time already, so circling back to Like, the public View and the eye. How crop 
dusters reviewed, one of the things that a couple of the pilots mentioned, is on social media seeing 
ads from. I guess you could call them at ambulance Chasers lawyers, who advertising like 
Compensation for like cancers or diseases that get and from the ground up and things like that 
around up and using spray planes as the visual as the visual. And I'd really like to get your take on 
that. 
                  
00:31:02 
AM 
 
Well, yeah, I mean there's first of all, you have the glyphosate suits side of glyphosate is the, is the 
active ingredient in the herbicide Roundup. Yeah. So there's been suits, On on Round Up by, you 
know, the irate that trial number of trial attorneys are trying to take advantage of what has 
happened in California, where there was multi-million dollar settlements for. I think it was a 
groundskeeper and so there's a big Mass lawsuit on glyphosate. And now there's another 
Herbicide where there's a similar suit going on, and I think what they're trying to do. This one one 
long term at least that I know of, they use a whole bunch of different pictures because I actually I 
made I went to this one of the website for one of the trial attorneys. All of a sudden, you know, 
your cookies or whatever, in your computer, pick it up and all of a sudden, anytime you're on 
social media those are the ads. You see because they're talking to each other, right? And they know 
what you're looking at. So they're trying to, you know what I'm saying? And so I do know that they 
are, they'll show workers that are using backpacks. Pesticide sprayers, you know, they kept 
backpack on tanks on the backpack and spraying, you know. They have Brownrigg ground rig 
Sprain and they have aircraft Sprain and its really directed towards the workers. I think they're 
trying to hit the workers so whether you're a pilot or a Tractor driver spraying with the backpack 
sprayer. They're trying to get a lot of people involved on on. In some sort of mass lawsuit. You 
know, it's tough. We get calls, like, what is in AAA doing about this and It's not just us that there, 
it's not just aerial applicators that they're hitting. They're trying to hit, you know, a pilot's, they're 
trying to hit, they're trying to get anybody. That's you that's using it in an occupational way and 
you know, you call up the firm and say, well we don't, we wish you wouldn't use a picture of an AG 
plane and basically just Let's just say I've done that and I think I wasted several minutes of, I've 
wasted several hours of my life doing that because they're not paying attention, 
                  
00:34:08 
EK 
 
no almost. Well, every pilot who we talked to, they talk about the phone calls that they get, you 
know, like don't fly over my house. You're poisoning me, you've killed and and they, I guess they 
get a lot of them. And the One Pilots way of dealing with it was just he just changed his takeoff 
pattern. He never goes over that house again, but but I think you know, you're dealing, you're 
wasting your, you know, hours of your life, trying to mitigate that they are too, you know, because 
they call that the people call the airport and they, you know, get a hold of the or they get on the 
internet where the pilots have advertised or Never. But anyway, they like they deal with it to 
constantly. Well, 
                  
00:35:01 
AM 
 
that call FAA or the sheriff and, you know, it's tough. I mean, although, you know, it's sometimes 
people I'd say 80% of the time, if you do, what the one person said did and took off on a different 
way or took another way home or you just call and say, Hey look I'm going to be probably will be 
near you. I just want to let you know and I'm, you know, I'm happy to show you. At my operation, 
you know, how I do my work and and that I'm always praying and the downwind, you know, 
downwind from your house not upwind and, you know, I'm I know where this products going, you 
know? They spend a little time on Customer relations. Yeah. And the uterus relations in this case it 
does help and some of our guys will have field days where they'll open up their operation for a big 
fish fry or whatever, bring in the community and it goes It goes a long ways. Donate to the local 
You know, high school football team or whatever. And but it's not a Fail-Safe you know you also 
have some people that just you can't convince, right? You don't write You know, you, I think 
sometimes people just want to be listened to and heard and, and treated respectfully. And if you 
do that nine times eight times out of 10, You know, you're going to have some success. 
                  
00:36:57 
EK 
 
Yep you have been great. We have learned a lot from your end and in a couple of weeks we're 
headed to only Texas to visit the egg draft. 
                  
00:37:10 
AM 
 
So 
                  
00:37:10 
EK 
 
that's two but you Isam starring was right? We did learn a lot talking to you and you've been, 
you've given us a lot of your time more than we thought. You know that you were you would and 
we're very grateful to it if there's anything we can do to improve public relations other than you 
know, outside of this project. Let us know. Well 
                  
00:37:37 
AM 
 
yeah, just keep us up-to-date on. You know, how these interviews can be seen. We want to 
publicize those much as possible. I mean the I'll tell you to other things, one is and I'll make sure 
Jake keeps you in. Warm, but hey, but you know, there's a big air show every year except for 2020 
by the Experimental Aircraft Association, it's in Oshkosh Wisconsin called are ventral. Yeah, I 
mean, it's literally like 600,000 people attend this over the week, and we're going to be exhibiting 
there. And we're going to be part of their Air Show, and have a little hundredth anniversary 
celebration on there, on the 20 Monday, the 26th of July. If you guys You're traveling around that 
might be kind of fun. 
                  
00:38:27 
EK 
 
Okay. And 
                  
00:38:28 
AM 
 
then because you said you're going to only which is great. I did you know, air tractor, It's a 
Wonderful Plan, Jim Hirsch, the president of air tractor is just a super super guy. Yeah. And and 
Leland snow is, you know, the founder. I mean, he would no question be on the Mount Rushmore 
of aerial application. If there was I mean yeah. If the guys icon a legend in our industry and was a 
you know I'm happy to have had a chance to work with him in my younger days so it's great. Yeah. 
So and then we're going to have an event here on the third meeting. I'm in the DC area and we're 
actually going to be donating and AG aircraft to the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum. In fact, it's 
the aircraft that Is modeled to look just like Dusty Crophopper from the Disney movie Planes. You 
guys have to watch planes if you haven't seen it yet, but the guy who owns Dusty Crophopper this 
aircraft is a guy named Rusty Lindemann. He's actually into harness Texas. But Rusty, is he's going 
to where he's going to come here. Bring Dusty Crophopper and he's dead. Part of the hundredth 
anniversary celebration is he's going to be donating that and fly off to donate that to the air and 
space museum. So, that's, that's August 3rd, okay? Probably in Leesburg, but we'll keep you 
posted, 
                  
00:40:10 
EK 
 
all right? That'd be great. I have some companies that were based and DC and I'll make sure they 
go. Wait, 
                  
00:40:18 
AM 
 
say that again. Your what I 
                  
00:40:19 
EK 
 
I said, I have some colleagues that are based around DC. I'll make sure they go, 
                  
00:40:22 
AM 
 
okay, yeah. Well, we already have a couple aircraft at the air and space museum. We have an AG 
cat. That's there. The hospital on door. You've helped the lon. Oh gosh! Pop the lawn was really be 
the first commercial. Aerial application. Business started in Macon. Georgia, moved to Monroe, 
Louisiana. They did, they did, they were so successful in aerial application that they started to 
diversify into mail package services. And then even passenger service, they renamed themselves. 
Today, you may have heard of them are known as Delta Airlines Delta Air Lines. I kid you not Delta 
Airlines in all this. 
                  
00:41:15 
EK 
 
It's like I read something about it, but you 
                  
00:41:18 
AM 
 
don't. I started as an aerial application company back in 1924, right? So it's amazing history, 
                  
00:41:29 
EK 
 
it is. Yeah it is. Delta is actually a towel outline of choice and it will be go any fly anywhere. We 
didn't know. Yeah, 
                  
00:41:40 
AM 
 
well it's also I think it's maybe I think Americans bigger there. One has a larger Fleet and one has 
more Or. Maybe capitalization our profit, I'm not sure but they're both know the two largest. 
Passenger services in the world so airlines in the world 
                  
00:42:01 
EK 
 
so that's neat. Just curious. Do you fly 
                  
00:42:06 
AM 
 
I do not I'm not a pilot if that's what you're asking. Yeah, my, I do fly a lot, but, but the now I don't 
I'm not, you know, it's my father was, he was in the Air Force and my background was in 
agriculture, and, you know, and policy and And so, you know, I know a bit about it, thought about 
it, but right around here, it's not the best, you know. That's you got to fly outside of the are 
Aerospace Defense Zone. Either in Leesburg or in, you know, bat a deep into Maryland to really fly. 
And it's it's a I'm not a pilot and 
                  
00:42:57 
EK 
 
with that. All right thank you so much. We appreciate your time and everything that you've shared 
with us. It's been great and we'll be in touch and yeah. So okay. Thank you guys. We'll see you at 
Oshkosh. 
                  
00:43:11 
AM 
 
Yeah and enjoy. Enjoy air tractor. Okay Jim I said hello. Alright 
                  
00:43:17 
EK 
 
I hope that we I'm my other son has been, he's our point of contact He's been communicating with 
him, so who will pass on your regards? He's 
                  
00:43:29 
AM
