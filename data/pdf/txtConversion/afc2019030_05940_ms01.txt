LG: 
Okay, today is December 19th, 2019. This is Lisa Gabbert, and I am talking to Dr. Doug 
Barnhart, at his home here, in Salt Lake City. 
 
 
Thank you so much for agreeing to do an interview. 
 
DB: 
I’m happy to do it.

LG: 
Can you please give me your birth date and your current title? 
 
DB: 
Yeah. I was born in 1965, and I am currently a professor of surgery, in the division of 
pediatric surgery at the University of Utah. 
 
LG: 
Great. Thank you very much. 
 
 
To kick us off, can you just tell me where you went to medical school, what years? 
 
DB: 
Sure. 
 
LG: 
As well as residency and fellowship? 
 
DB: 
Yeah. So, I went to Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. I graduated in 1992. 
And then I did my general surgery residency at the University of Michigan. And I 
finished that in 1999. And then I did a fellowship in pediatric surgery at CS Mott 
Children’s Hospital at the University of Michigan; finished that in 2001. 
 
LG: 
And then is that when you came to Utah? 
 
DB: 
No, then I actually went and joined the faculty at the University of Alabama in 
Birmingham (from 2001 to 2008). And then I moved to the University of Utah in 2008. 
 
LG: 
Okay, great. Thank you very much.  
 
 
So, how did you decide to become a doctor? 
 
DB: 
That’s a great question. It was a pretty easy choice for me, actually. I was kind of 
fascinated by science things, but liked being involved with people. And so, back when I 
was in high school I kind of started exploring that. And actually, I became an emergency 
medical technician (with the help of my dad) when I was 16. And that was great, because 
you actually – even though the knowledge level is about 100 hours of training, you’re 
actually able to be involved in taking care of patients. And I really enjoyed doing that. 
So, that was pretty natural fit for somebody that liked a bunch of studying, liked taking 
care of patients – it was a pretty obvious choice.  
 
LG: 
Was your dad an EMT? 
 
DB: 
Well he did it just because I wanted to. 
 
LG: 
Oh. 
 
DB: 
He was a good dad. It was the kid’s interest, so – and I couldn’t drive to the classes, so 
we went together and we both did it together. So, yeah – he did it solely so that I could do 
it.

[02:16] 
 
LG: 
That’s nice. 
 
DB: 
Yeah. 
 
LG: 
And did that lead naturally into medicine, or did you think about staying with EMT? 
 
DB: 
No; I mean, academically I wanted, you know, I wanted to go to college and do some 
kind of graduate school. So, it was pretty clear that what I wanted to do was go to 
medical school. 
 
LG: 
Can you tell the story of getting into medical school? 
 
DB: 
Yeah, I definitely can recall that very clearly [laughs] because we were – at that point, I 
was either engaged or on the verge of getting engaged. So, you’re trying to figure out 
where you’re going to live, and you know, of course medical school – you typically apply 
to bunches of medical schools because the admission rate was pretty low back then.  
 
 
But you could also apply early decision. So, if you applied early decision, you made a 
commitment that they would decide on you within the first month, but then you’re 
obligated to go to that medical school. So, I made the decision to apply to Hopkins early, 
got in, and that was that.  
 
 
So, I can very distinctly remember burning my application to some other prominent 
schools that we have photos of – I have a picture of a Harvard medical school application 
burning after I’d gotten into Hopkins. 
 
LG: 
[Laughs] Nice, nice.  
 
 
For people who don’t know, can you describe your experience in medical school, what 
that was like? 
 
DB: 
Yeah. So, I loved medical school, which was very different than being an undergrad. 
Being an undergrad, I found (and I was an undergrad at Hopkins) – and that was a 
pressure cooker. It was – I would say always fair, but always very competitive. 
Everybody recognized that getting into med school was going to be competitive, so 
everybody tried to study more than the person next to them. So, that was really high 
pressure.  
 
 
And then when I got to medical school it was demanding, but it was what you wanted to 
do. And everybody there was going to ultimately get to do what they wanted to do, if 
they just hung in there. So, there was a real strong sense of comradery.  
 
[04:26] 
Physician Oral History: Doug Barnhart 
Page 4 
 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
DB: 
As you kind of – you know, it was really demanding in terms of the amount of things you 
had to learn, and just that beginning of this transition into a physician role. I mean, it’s 
stressful. 
 
 
And to just kind of make that transition you’ve been waiting, and waiting, and waiting to 
get there; when you finally get there and become a part of this group – it was super 
exciting. I mean, lots and lots of work, and lots and lots of studying, and that, particularly 
in the first two years.  
 
 
Back then it was all basic science the first year, and then basic pathology and patho-
physiology. So, the first year’s normal anatomy, normal physiology; the next year is 
abnormal physiology, and abnormal anatomy. And then the third year was basic 
clerkships of basic medicine, pediatrics, ob/gyn, surgery. And then the fourth year was 
advanced sub-specialties in those things. So, really, really exciting times. I loved medical 
school. 
 
LG: 
What is one of your strongest memories? 
 
DB: 
Boy, there’s a lot of good memories. I think one thing for sure was that first time we 
actually begin taking care of patients, and start to learn that role as a doctor.  
 
 
And at Hopkins, in that phase, the first time that was actually psychiatry. So, the first year 
of medical school, in the behavioral health and psychiatry (kind of basic science part) you 
actually started to interview patients and learn to do the psychiatric history. And so, just 
that part of kind of learning to take on that role is very distinctive.  
 
 
I have distinct memories of the Chairman of Psychiatry kind of laying out the 
expectations for people: how you dress, how you behave for patients, and that part. So, 
that’s a very distinct memory for me.  
 
[06:33] 
 
 
Another very clear set of memories is by the time I was pretty early in medical school I 
knew I wanted to do surgery. And kind of the way medical school curriculums are 
structured, you only have certain amount of times in certain specialties. So, if there are 
things you really like, there’s big blocks of times where you’re not doing that.  
 
 
And so, in the fourth year, the general advice was if you wanted to do general surgery, 
fourth-year is really the time to get all the medicine things in, so you should do things 
like infectious disease, and nephrology, and these other things, rather than do surgery. 
Which I did, but it was – I kind of felt like I was missing out on the thing that really 
excited me.  
 
Physician Oral History: Doug Barnhart 
Page 5 
 
 
So, I had one of the faculty who ran the trauma service, and just contacted him (I was 
going to say emailed, but I don’t think we had email back then). So, I probably left him a 
note and called him, but –  
 
LG: 
[Laughing] 
 
DB: 
But anyway, just said, “Hey, I’m really interested in surgery, so I’d like to spend more 
time doing this.” 
 
 
So, on Friday nights he didn’t have a chief resident; so, he was on call, and I would just 
go with him. And those were great times, because they were kind of a chance to kind of 
function at one level higher with this faculty member, and all the things you wanted to 
do. And be up all night doing these things with him, throughout the wee hours of the 
night. And so, there are lots of memories from that. 
 
LG: 
Can you describe one of those memories? 
 
DB: 
Yeah. So, I think for sure (since it was trauma) – and this was Baltimore in the early ‘90s 
(so, there was a lot of violence in inner city Baltimore). So, I can remember, you know, 
people come in, you know, shot through the chest with us. You know, young guys – 
resuscitating them in the ER, and then taking them up to the operating room to operate on 
them and save their lives.  
 
 
Another very distinct memory that drew me into surgery was when I was at the city 
hospital, and it was somebody who had been in a car crash and just ruptured their spleen, 
which is pretty dramatic, because it bleeds so much and you can have hemorrhage and 
low blood pressure.   
 
 
And now, kind of the you know, once you’ve completed your surgery training, you 
realize actually taking that spleen out is a very simple operation to do. But we, kind of as 
a young medical student [??] took this guy who had very low blood pressures, and was 
you know, exsanguinating. Took him to the operating room, took his spleen out, and you 
know, four or five days later he went home.  
 
[09:12] 
 
And the thing I remember reflecting on is like the natural history of that disease is you 
die. And with this pretty brief intervention, he’s basically back to being a normal person; 
which I think is one of the things that is really, you know, the appeal, the thing that draws 
people into surgery: is this ability to, you know, make a sudden, short intervention that 
really can dramatically change the course for people. 
 
LG: 
That was actually one of my questions, is how did you decide on surgery? What was it 
about surgery you liked? 
 
Physician Oral History: Doug Barnhart 
Page 6 
 
DB: 
There are several things, I think. And I was really pretty clear to me that if I did surgery I 
was going to do some form of general surgery. I ended up, you know now in, pediatric 
general surgery (so, it’s general surgery for babies).  
 
 
But I wanted to be the kind of doctor that actually took care of people when they’re at 
their sickest. And not just have just stable patients with, you know, single problems. I 
wanted to actually be able to care for a broad range of problems. And I enjoyed doing 
things. I liked that idea that you could “fix” things. So, those, I think, are part of it that 
appealed to me. 
 
 
There’s also – kind of to reflect on it – when you first come into the surgery world, 
there’s a little bit of it that’s a bit of a romantic attraction to it, because it’s a totally 
different environment. There’s a part of it that actually is probably pretty ritualized, 
right? You put on special clothes, you go to places where other people can’t go – there’s 
a whole series of rituals to it. So, you feel like you’re part of kind of included in this 
small group of people, that’s you know, some special ability, special privileges probably. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
DB: 
I think there’s probably some appeal to that to people. 
 
[11:15] 
 
 
As I’ve done it, I think the other thing I’ve learned that I like about surgery is it’s a big 
team that takes care of people. They’re really – it’s not a single, star-performer that does 
it: it’s this whole huge team you’ve got. You know, just in the operating room you’ve got 
anesthesia, and monitoring techs, and surgery techs, and OR nurses.  
 
 
So, there’s never a point where you’re kind of alone and bored. It’s this big team sport 
and you know, you’ve got a very distinct role that you do within the team, which I think 
was appealing to me then, and one thing that makes it satisfying now. 
 
LG: 
Can you talk a little bit about your surgery residency specifically? 
 
DB: 
Yes. 
 
LG: 
Once you made that decision? 
 
DB: 
Yeah, it may be an understatement to say that surgery residency is a formative experience 
[laughs]. It is.  
 
LG: 
How long was it? 
 
DB: 
So, I did five years of clinical surgery as a general surgery resident, plus two years of 
research, and then two years of pediatric surgery residency. And back then, much of that 
was on call every other night. So, it was –  
Physician Oral History: Doug Barnhart 
Page 7 
 
 
LG: 
For people who don’t know, can you explain that? 
 
DB: 
That means there is always a resident surgeon in-house. And the way we staffed the 
services then, there were two of us at any level. So, in your early years it means every 
other day you sleep in the hospital. And the days you’re not sleeping in the hospital, you 
work all day. So, come in Monday morning, work all day Monday, stay Monday night, 
work all day Tuesday, go home about six or seven o’clock at night on Tuesday. Sleep in 
your own bed Tuesday night, get up, come in Wednesday, do the same thing until 
Thursday evening. So, it is super intense.  
 
[13:14] 
 
 
But there was a part of it that, I mean, it really was a special time. I mean, it’s really 
demanding – kind of physically, and emotionally; certainly on your family, your marriage 
– all those things are strained by it. But I think it created friendships that are 
incomparable, on the people that I was an intern with are still friends now, even though 
they live in different parts of the country.  
 
 
I mean, they’re a group that you stay in contact with; you went through tons of stuff 
together (in terms of taking care of sick patients, putting up with people [laughs], your 
bosses yelling at you, living with what seemed like unreasonable demands) – kind of a 
little bit of a foxhole mentality among the residents: you’re in it together. So, that’s a 
special part.  
 
 
I think it’s a time where, by virtue of being in the hospital that much, you’ve got really a 
particular and special relationship with your patients. Even though they realize you’re the 
junior doctor, and that you’re not making the final decisions, they – in a big university 
hospital like that – the patients realize you’re the one that’s there all the time, and kind of 
come to trust you as the fact-finder and the person that can navigate the system for them.  
 
 
So, I think you know, then with the nurses – you’re there all the time, so you’re their go-
to person. And then if you’re receptive, and listen, and learn from them, they become 
friends. So, it was really exhausting, really tiring time; but also, pretty special. 
 
LG: 
Is there a story or an experience that you’d be willing to share from that time, that kind of 
captures that intensity? 
 
DB: 
Yeah, there would be a bunch. Let me think of some really clear ones.  
 
[15:16] 
 
 
So, certainly as an intern – one particular patient I remember, Charlie, who was a man 
who had a horrible injury and ended up with severe lung disease as a result. At that point, 
University of Michigan was really kind of one of the leaders in doing kind of long-term 
Physician Oral History: Doug Barnhart 
Page 8 
 
cardio-pulmonary bypass, to try to bridge people through this time when their lungs are 
diseased.  
 
 
And so, (it was called ECMO) when he got sick he was too sick even for that as an 
investigational thing. And there was a different investigational thing that was kind of on 
an FDA, kind of early trial phase, where you put this special device into the big vein in 
their abdomen, try to give them oxygen that way. And ultimately, that device wasn’t 
approved because it wasn’t that successful.  
 
 
But he was the one patient that survived with it. And so, he was there hundreds and 
hundreds of days. And it was, you know, very complicated. And so, you know, kind of in 
the first months my internship was trying to help him stay alive. And then by the later 
parts of the internship it was trying to help Charlie get enough nutrition so that he could 
get well enough to go home.  
 
 
So, yeah – so, you have these experiences where it’s months and months of you trying to 
wrestle through these things with patients like that, and they you know, along the way 
there’s these bumps, these horrible life-threatening events that you have to manage. You 
know, so there’s definitely some of those patients that are very clear in your mind, that 
you know, gosh, 25 years later –  
 
LG: 
Yeah. 
 
DB: 
And I still remember his whole name. 
 
LG: 
Yeah, yeah. 
 
[17:17] 
 
 
So, surgery is probably one of the most intense, you know, residencies and specialties; 
but I think that the training for almost all the specialties is intense –  
 
DB: 
Yeah. 
 
LG: 
In its own way. How do you handle that kind of pressure, particularly when you’re being 
trained? 
 
DB: 
Yeah, I think there are a number of different pressures you need to learn to deal with. I 
think the easiest ones to deal with are the time demands, and the intellectual demands, the 
demands that just kind of – you’ve got bosses that you may never be able to please. And I 
think some of those are one, you’re fatigued [laughing] to where you just kind of getting 
over them yelling at you, is one way. 
 
 
I think the things of time: you learn how to manage it, you learn how to function when 
you’re tired, you learn how to apologize when you’re grumpy with people that wake you 
Physician Oral History: Doug Barnhart 
Page 9 
 
up in the middle of the night. And I’ve come to accept some of those imperfections, 
right? Learn to go back and say you’re sorry, and people are generally pretty forgiving. 
 
 
So, I think those are things you learn. I think that probably the harder part to learn, and I 
think this is probably a more clear part of the surgery resident experience (than other 
docs, I think), which is actually when you make a mistake that hurts somebody. And that 
is always a part of surgery residents training. And it’s always part of what you do as a 
surgeon.  
 
 
So, that part that, despite doing your best, there is some decision you make that is not – 
that doesn’t turn out well. And even though you were diligent, and made it with best 
intents, it actually, it’s a decision that ends up with somebody being harmed.  
 
[19:28] 
 
 
And I think those are the hardest stresses to deal with. And as I actually – as you watch 
residents that struggle, I think it’s that they don’t figure out how to deal with that. And I 
don’t know that there is a single way to deal with it. I think it’s a little bit of kind of being 
in that tribe.  
 
 
I think (again) that part of being a team in surgery helps, right – that they recognize that 
other people have lived that and have come through it, and that they help you get through 
it – I think are the things that probably help people learn to deal with that. I think that’s 
the healthy way to deal with it, is that you recognize that it’s real: it really did happen, 
and that it happened to other people. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
DB: 
And they don’t make perfect decisions either. And it’s part of the experience.  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm, um-hmm. It seems like perfectionism would be both encouraged (in some 
ways) because of course, you don’t want a mistake –  
 
DB: 
Right, yeah. 
 
LG: 
Make mistakes; but at the same time, of course, people –  
 
DB: 
Yeah. 
 
LG: 
Do make mistakes. 
 
DB: 
Yeah, exactly. 
 
LG: 
You know, it’s difficult. 
 
DB: 
Yeah, it is. It’s striving to be perfect, but recognizing you won’t be.  
Physician Oral History: Doug Barnhart 
Page 10 
 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
DB: 
And then forgiving yourself when you’re not. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm, um-hmm. You and I have had previous conversations about the question of 
whether or not physicians have sort of a low-grade suffering, or in some cases even a 
high-grade suffering –  
 
DB: 
Yeah. 
 
LG: 
And one of the things I’ve learned over the course of this research is that physicians 
actually have a high suicide rate. 
 
DB: 
Yeah; right, yeah. 
 
LG: 
Can you talk a little bit about your understandings of the ways in which physicians may 
suffer as a part of their work? 
 
DB: 
Yeah. I think now, where the experience I’ve had now, I recognize – I mean, it should be 
expected, right? I mean, I think – I mean, the nature of what we do is you’re entering into 
suffering, right? Every patient you see has some problem that they’re suffering with. And 
if you’re compassionate, you’re going to share in that suffering.  
 
 
And in some cases, what they’re suffering through is horrible, you know? Whether it’s 
parents where a child has just been diagnosed with cancer, or a premature baby that’s 
born that has life-threatening anomaly, or a healthy kid that’s involved in a trauma that’s 
life-threatening. I mean, it’s horrible suffering that you’re recognizing in the world.  
 
[22:08] 
 
 
I mean, I think for most people, as they go through life you may have one friend or one 
neighbor that experiences this once. And the reality of it is, this is what you do every day. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
DB: 
So, I think there’s a part of it that just being in the presence of that suffering, if you have 
empathy, you’re going to suffer also. 
 
 
And I think that can kind of create a low-grade or medium-grade suffering, just as a part 
of what you do every day.  
 
 
Hopefully, within that you have some hope that you’re relieving it in some way, either 
through fixing a problem, or at least being present with people. But even with that, it’s 
fatiguing. 
 
Physician Oral History: Doug Barnhart 
Page 11 
 
LG: 
Yeah. 
 
DB: 
And then I think, and then there’s acute exacerbations where it’s either it’s some decision 
you make where the decision you made may have not been ideal, and that contributes to 
the problem. That’s probably not that frequent, but definitely that – you suffer a lot when 
that happens. 
 
 
I think there are other times when you suffer because you may know that there’s an ideal 
thing that can be done, and for whatever practical reason you can’t accomplish it: either 
you don’t have the resources, you’re in some other country, some hassle with 
reimbursement insurance, or available facilities, or the distance you are from the facility 
where you recognize that there’s something that could be done that’s not done.  
 
 
So, I think more the social challenges that a particular patient’s in; and those are things, I 
think, kind of acutely make the suffering worse.  
 
LG: 
Can you think of an example? 
 
[24:08] 
 
DB: 
Oh, yeah. Well the easy examples for me personally, are—I volunteer in Kenya. So, we 
take care of kids there and we can really do quite a bit there, compared to what is done in 
a lot of countries. But you know, it’s not the same as North America. So, we’ve got two 
ventilators for kids, so it means that it’s not infrequent that we’ll make a decision about 
what child will be ventilated, and therefore, what child won’t get a ventilator. And the 
natural consequence is that they’ll die. So, just that limitation of resources. 
 
 
You’ll see kids come in with really advanced disease, that if you would be in a system 
where there was more care available, they would have been recognized early and treated 
with, you know, an outcome that would be expected to cure them.  
 
 
And then there’s lesser degrees of that here, but similar.  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm, um-hmm. 
 
 
And how have you, you know, now that you’ve had a long career, how have you, 
personally, learned to deal with this? Or what strategies have you figured out that you 
would recommend to others? Or not? 
 
DB: 
Well no – well there are strategies; there’s no curing it –  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
DB: 
I think that’s the first thing, right? If you’re going to be present with people that are 
suffering, you should expect to suffer. 
 
Physician Oral History: Doug Barnhart 
Page 12 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
DB: 
And that’s normal, and that’s healthy, right? So, I think that’s part of it, is not to be 
surprised by it. So, that’s one part. 
 
 
I think another thing is that to recognize it’s okay to acknowledge that. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
DB: 
I think that’s actually probably one of the real hard parts of medicine, is I think it’s 
historically not been okay to be troubled by these things. And so, it ends up with people 
suffering a lot, and suffering a lot alone. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
[26:20] 
 
DB: 
I think having a group of people that is probably a pretty small group of people that you 
trust and actually be honest with, about both kind of what you see that frustrates you in 
this, or what you see that – where you feel like you fell short, and you can kind of be 
honest about that, and have other people tell you that, “Well nobody expects you to be 
perfect.” 
 
 
So, I think those are probably the healthy ways to cope with it. I think having some times 
we’re not there helps. I mean, you can’t, you know, always be in that situation. And I 
think a little bit of it is kind of what we do, what appeals to pediatric surgery to me is 
you’ve got to be in an area where you get some wins too, right? That helps.  
 
 
I mean, you know, when you see kids where you’re taking out their tumors and five years 
later that they’re healthy, you know, those are big wins and they keep you going on the 
bad ones.  
 
LG: 
Can you give me an example of one of those wins that sticks out in your mind? 
 
DB: 
Yeah [laughs], there’s bunches of them. So, yeah.  
 
 
Just a couple weeks ago I was in the hospital cafeteria, and some parents come up to me 
and say, “Oh, you don’t remember us, you know, we’re here for our oncology visit, 
because she’s three years out of her Wilms tumor.” And you know, at that point she was 
a little toddler, now she’s you know, four or five years old. And just kind of sent me that 
picture of, you know, the time when we’re at the bedside, before I took the tumor out. So, 
yeah. 
 
 
And our specialty is fortunate, we get lots of them like that. So, those are big wins. Every 
time we see our mutual friend, when I took her neuroblastoma out, I think that. So, yeah.

LG: 
Nice, nice.  
 
DB: 
So, yeah. 
 
LG: 
How would you say being a physician has changed you as a person? 
 
[28:20] 
 
DB: 
Wow. 
 
LG: 
You’ve been a physician a long time –  
 
DB: 
Yeah, I can’t imagine not being, honestly. I mean, that’s probably the clearest way. I 
honestly – I can’t imagine, honestly, what I’d would be like if I wasn’t a physician. And 
even if I wasn’t a surgeon, it’s so much of what my life experience is, in terms of being 
with people while they’re suffering, kind of getting to be part of their victories, kind of 
being with parents when their kids die.  
 
 
I mean, that’s – I honestly, it would be difficult for me to look back, take that 20-year-old 
kid in college, and even try to imagine what it would be like at 54 without those 
experiences. I don’t know what I’d be without it. So, I think in some sense it’s like every 
bit of who I am is part of that, just shaped by all those experiences. 
 
LG: 
Yeah. Can you think of a funny experience that you’ve had in your training? 
 
DB: 
Yeah, let me think. 
 
LG: 
Or during residency – sometimes people tell very funny stories about –  
 
DB: 
Wow, boy – yeah. [Laughs] Most of them would be torturing other residents. Kind of the 
typical hobby at two o’clock in the morning, would actually be to call one of your friends 
that’s on call and pretend to be somebody from another hospital, trying to transfer 
something in that’s going to keep them awake all night. 
 
 
We would particularly do that when we were at the VA hospital, because we served a 
whole series of very small VA hospitals, that were from all around the state of Michigan 
and around Ohio. And invariably, we called them up at two o’clock in the morning, give 
them very limited details of somebody that’s horribly sick, and tell them that – any time 
they’d ask for more information, just not be able to give it to them. So, that’s one.  
 
[30:31] 
 
 
We did that just two Christmases ago, when I was on call. We called my partner to 
pretend that one of his patients was in the emergency department in another hospital he 
was covering, and we just couldn’t give him any real details about what the problem was 
–  
Physician Oral History: Doug Barnhart 
Page 14 
 
 
LG: 
[Laughs] 
 
DB: 
But that the family really wanted him [laughing] to drive an hour away, just to address 
some questions. And it was great to kind of watch him, listen to him try to maintain his 
patience while we just kept saying, “Well no, but they really would just like to talk to 
you.” 
 
[Laughter] 
 
 
So, that’s probably our – and unfortunately, all of us fall for it, because you’re geared up 
to be polite to whoever calls. And so, you can take people quite a long way on one of 
those phone calls. And so, that’s probably [laughs] our most common joke. 
 
LG: 
Do you end up telling them on the phone, or? 
 
DB: 
Oh, yeah – that one, yeah; we would say – this actually had a resident, and we got about 
five minutes into it and finally his patience ran thin, he was like, “Well I’m sitting here 
with Dr. Barnhart, and he thinks you should come see him.” And he was like, which – 
and we’ll leave the profanities out of the recording. 
 
LG: 
[Laughs] Do you find that you joke with each other? 
 
DB: 
Yeah. 
 
LG: 
Or tease each other. 
 
DB: 
Oh, yeah. Yeah, and I think there’s actually a little bit of gallows humor too. I think 
there’s a bit of, that’s how you cope with some of the stress, honestly, is kind of – when 
there’s not another way to deal with it, sometimes you’ll joke about the situation, just 
because you don’t really know what else to do with it, I think. That’s somewhat common, 
too. So, yeah. 
 
LG: 
Can you talk about that a little bit? 
 
DB: 
Let me think – it’s hard to think of an example. One of the chronically frustrating things 
in pediatric surgery is kids get hurt on the all-terrain vehicles, right? Because they put 
very small kids on these things. 
 
LG: 
Yeah. 
 
[32:35] 
 
DB: 
And so, we had some poor little five-year-old who had been driving one of these, and 
crashed and was seriously hurt. And so, one resident calls my fellow to explain this to 
him, and he’s just like, “Well did you ask what other vehicles they are able to drive?” 
Physician Oral History: Doug Barnhart 
Page 15 
 
Just sorts of things like that – I’d say probably more it’s more sarcasm than humor, I 
think, is probably how some of these things – where you just, you can’t wrap your head 
around how this happens or occurs. And it’s usually in the setting of trauma, because it’s 
really frustrating to see because it’s something that was preventable. 
 
LG: 
Right. 
 
DB: 
And (at least from our viewpoint) and it didn’t have to happen. It has devastating effects 
for people. 
 
LG: 
My husband calls them “all-trauma vehicles.” 
 
DB: 
Yes [laughs], yes. Yeah, right. 
 
LG: 
It’s his nickname for them. 
 
 
What about – you mentioned sort of joking each other –  
 
DB: 
Yeah. 
 
LG: 
And playing practical jokes – do you think that’s common in surgery? 
 
DB: 
Maybe it’s just common with immature people like me. 
 
LG: 
[Laughs] 
 
DB: 
See, now that you say that, actually now I’m thinking of more of the things we do – some 
of them are very low-grade humor that we do, and there’s some pretty simple things that 
we do that would keep us entertained in those wee hours, actually. 
 
 
Another great thing – you’ve got all the white coats lined up in the OR, and like a great 
thing to do to your buddy is like take their sleeve, and tie it in this super tight knot, right? 
 
LG: 
[Laughs] 
 
DB: 
So, when they grab their coat off the hook to run down the hall and go put it on, they 
can’t get their sleeve down. 
 
 
You can also take a cup of water and put it into that pocket so it hangs just perfectly, so 
that when they go to throw that coat on in a hurry, the water just spills all over them. 
 
LG: 
[Laughs] 
 
DB: 
We use this KY jelly for various source of lubricants, but you can also like pack that into 
people’s stethoscope ear buds, and see how long it takes for them to realize why they 
can’t hear anything through their stethoscope. 
Physician Oral History: Doug Barnhart 
Page 16 
 
 
 
So, yeah – these actually, intern humor that I’d kind of forgotten about until now, yeah. 
 
LG: 
Oh, really? 
 
DB: 
Yeah, this was  
 
LG: 
Intern year? 
 
DB: 
A way to keep yourself entertained, was actually stop in a line to tie somebody’s sleeve 
into a tight knot, so they can’t get their coat on when they’re running. 
 
[34:48] 
 
LG: 
Do you think that there’s a relationship between, you know, there’s a lot of different 
kinds of humor, I think, that happens in medical –  
 
DB: 
Um-hmm. 
 
LG: 
But do you think there is a relationship between the stress and trauma of some of the 
work situations, and the humor that emerges? 
 
DB: 
Yeah, I think it – and I don’t even know it’s necessarily the content of the humor; I think 
it’s the bit of a need to have any kind of humor. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
DB: 
You know, actually now, in this era, I mean it’s a lot about texting each other emoticons, 
and stuff like that, right? 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
DB: 
Of kind of a little bit of just kind of checking in with each other. And there’s usually 
some Star Wars reference, or something, [laughs] about each other to kind of –  
 
 
And I think a little bit of it is just to normalize life in the midst of that stress. And I think 
it's more that than actually the content of any of the humor, and I think it’s for sure it’s 
you’re dealing with all of these things. And a little bit of just a check in, we’re socially 
okay; there’s a bit of us that’s still socially regular. 
 
LG: 
Yeah. 
 
DB: 
You know, I think is part of what happens with it. 
 
LG: 
It does emerge in other high-stress occupations. There’s actually a whole book on trial 
lawyer humor, for example. 
Physician Oral History: Doug Barnhart 
Page 17 
 
 
DB: 
Um-hmm, yeah. 
 
LG: 
And also, among like stockbrokers –  
 
DB: 
Okay. 
 
LG: 
You know? Not brokers, but traders. 
 
DB: 
Yeah. 
 
LG: 
People that actually work on the floor. 
 
DB: 
Yeah. 
 
LG: 
Kind of sometimes similar –  
 
DB: 
Right, yeah, yeah. 
 
LG: 
Similar sorts of things. 
 
 
How do people treat you when they learn you’re a physician? 
 
DB: 
I don’t know; that’s an interesting question. Again, well my mother (when she found out 
I was a physician) started writing it on the outside of all the letters she’d send me. So, that 
was the one person that would write me, “Dr. Barnhart,” was my mom. 
 
LG: 
[Laughs] That’s cute.  
 
DB: 
[Laughs] But other people – it’s interesting, I honestly don’t know if people treat me 
differently or not. I think the most common thing is people assume you’re busy. I’d say 
that’s the most common response, I think, when people hear you’re a physician is they 
assume you’re overly busy, is one. 
 
[37:21] 
 
 
I think (in general) there’s  a sense of respect for what you do, and some deference 
expertise in some areas, I think. I think it’s different in different places. Certainly, when 
I’m in Kenya it’s more than in America now.  
 
 
But I think those would be like the general things.  
 
 
I’d say probably the negative side is like people often think you’re too busy to be 
bothered, right, with a whole series of things (you know, social things, or asking you to 
do volunteer activities or anything else, they’ll assume that you’re overly committed, you 
know, really busy). 
Physician Oral History: Doug Barnhart 
Page 18 
 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm, um-hmm. 
 
 
And if you were going to give advice to somebody who is thinking about going to 
medical school, you know, what kinds of things would you want them to know? Or what 
kind of advice would you give them? 
 
DB: 
I would tell them first I think I’ve got the best job in the world, operating on kids. So, I 
think I would tell them that. But I’d say if you think you’d be happy doing anything else, 
you should probably do that, because it’s pretty demanding, and pretty stressful. So, it’s 
kind of conflicting messages that way. 
 
 
I think I’d say one, I would tell them it’s more gratifying than I imagined it would be. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm? 
 
DB: 
And you know, it’s a privilege to have people (parents) that trust their kids to your care. 
At a critical time when they really have no ability to control what you do after they say 
okay. So, I think that part, I mean it’s a huge privilege, and a huge honor that parents give 
you every day. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
DB: 
So, in that part I’d tell them it’s more gratifying than I ever guessed it would be. And it’s 
more satisfying to see a kid get well. I mean, we have lots of things that we fix where the 
natural history of what would happen to a kid if surgery didn’t exist to fix this, is that 
they would die. And lots of them you can take them and make them well, and have them 
live full, full lives into adulthood. So, I think that would be one thing I’d tell them.  
 
 
I think I’d also tell them that it’s going to be more stressful than they can probably 
imagine. And to recognize there’s part of it that may actually be damaging to them –  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
[40:15] 
 
DB: 
More than they realize. That there will be part of that suffering you take on – it’s a hit to 
you each time. And I think even if you come up with strategies to cope with it, that that’s 
real. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
DB: 
You know, there’s a lot of talk now – things like physician burnout. 
 
LG: 
[Inaudible] 
 
Physician Oral History: Doug Barnhart 
Page 19 
 
DB: 
And I think that [?] I’ve read about, that’s actually probably mislabeled. I think it’s 
actually probably people aren’t really burned out; it’s actually this concept of moral 
injury –  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
DB: 
And I think when physicians talk about burnout, that’s really probably more what’s 
happening, is that they are in these situations where their values tell them they should be 
able to do one thing to make it better, and they can’t. And it’s how do you resolve that? 
 
 
And yeah, it’s not just burnout that gets better by getting some rest and doing something 
you like to do; it’s these kind of really deep issues that you’ve got to wrestle with. 
 
 
Yeah, so I guess those would be my things. So, it’s do it, it’s super rewarding, but be, you 
know, be advised and count the cost.  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. Yeah, I looked up that term, “moral injury,” and it’s out there, but there’s not a 
lot out on it. 
 
DB: 
Yeah, there’s really not; yeah. 
 
LG: 
You know, it came from veterans. 
 
DB: 
Right, yeah. 
 
LG: 
From the military. 
 
DB: 
From military on, yeah. 
 
LG: 
From military, and they were applying it to physicians, saying I think the definition was: 
“Inability to give quality care” –  
 
DB: 
Right, yeah. 
 
LG: 
In particular kinds of circumstances –  
 
DB: 
Yeah. 
 
LG: 
Or the kind of care that you would want to –  
 
DB: 
Right, yeah. 
 
LG: 
But it was interesting to me that, because it’s a very compelling term –  
 
DB: 
Yeah. 
 
Physician Oral History: Doug Barnhart 
Page 20 
 
LG: 
It didn’t seem to be very well-developed. 
 
DB: 
Yeah, it’s really not. I mean, I’ve read a couple articles in kind of throw-away journals –  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm? 
 
DB: 
On it; but I think there’s a part of it that rings true to me. Because I think that whatever 
term you want to put on it, I think that phenomena – and it may not just be moral injury – 
but this reality of doing your best, having to not be good enough. And even doing your 
best and maybe hurting someone is actually what makes it hard for people to work. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm? 
 
[42:30] 
 
DB: 
It’s probably not the work hours, it’s probably not the fact that you didn’t get as much 
recreational time as other people; it’s this loss of sense of meaning –  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
DB: 
Or loss of sense of confidence that you’re doing a good job and doing the right thing. I 
think as I kind of talk to people and listen to people, I think those are really the things that 
weigh people down and take them out. Because there are lots and lots of surgeons that 
work lots and lots of hours and are happy. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
DB: 
They kind of get through that, so. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm, um-hmm. 
 
 
I like the fact that you said a couple of times that – not that there’s nothing we can do 
about it, but that it just needs to be acknowledged that this is –  
 
DB: 
Yeah. 
 
LG: 
What’s going to happen. 
 
DB: 
Right. 
 
LG: 
You know? 
 
DB: 
You’re entering into suffering. 
 
LG: 
Yeah, yeah. And I think, you know, at a really basic level, no matter what kind of 
physician you are, you really are dealing with life and death. 
Physician Oral History: Doug Barnhart 
Page 21 
 
 
DB: 
Right, yeah. 
 
LG: 
You know, even if you’re just giving somebody something for a cold. 
 
DB: 
Right, yeah; right. 
 
LG: 
You know, you’re still staving off sickness. 
 
DB: 
Yeah, right; yeah, right. Yeah, well and you’re facing people’s mortality, right? 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
DB: 
I mean, most people’s job, they can ignore that that’s real. 
 
LG: 
Yeah, yeah. 
 
DB: 
That that’s part of the human experience. 
 
LG: 
Yeah. 
 
DB: 
And they miss that, yeah. 
 
LG: 
I wonder if there’s – is this being addressed in medical communities? I know that 
physician resilience is sort of a hot term right now. 
 
DB: 
Yeah. It’s interesting, and I think it’s different in different places. There’s a lot of 
discussion of physician burnout and resiliency. 
 
 
And I think it is variable, kind of how people approach that and how programs approach 
that. I think some of it is a bit more, in that you need more recreational time, you need 
ergonomics to make your job easier so your back doesn’t hurt. Which those things may 
be true; I don’t think they’re the fundamental reason that physicians struggle, or why 
there’s an increased rate of physician suicide. I think those things are –  
 
[44:52] 
 
LG: 
Has it increased? 
 
DB: 
Kind of outrun the edge –  
 
 
Physician suicide? 
 
LG: 
Is that an increased number? Or is that just like a number that’s historically –  
 
Physician Oral History: Doug Barnhart 
Page 22 
 
DB: 
I don’t know if it’s increased or not. I don’t know what the pattern of that has been. I 
know it’s higher than the general population. 
 
LG: 
Oh, yeah. 
 
DB: 
Yeah. 
 
LG: 
Yeah. 
 
DB: 
And so, I don’t know if it’s rising or not. 
 
 
But anyway, so I think some of these things are actually – I don’t think they’re 
addressing the fundamental issue. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
DB: 
And I also worry a little bit of it – some of these things that are advocated like that are 
actually just what people that are balanced and happy and have resolved some of these 
things do; and so, then it gets kind of interpreted that that’s the cure. 
 
LG: 
Right. 
 
DB: 
And I’m not sure that’s what it is.  
 
 
And I think some of those events that happen when people are caring for patients, 
whether it’s just a patient that you’re particularly attached to that dies, that maybe was 
unavoidable, but just that you became particularly bonded to. Or whether it’s something 
where you feel like you may have made an error. I think there’s a cumulative effect of 
those, and if they’re not addressed they don’t go away. And they linger, and over time 
they pile up and contribute –  
 
 
Without any evidence, I’ve got this theory that it’s a little bit like a boxing match, right? 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
DB: 
If you ever watch any boxing, there’s this part of like these hard hits that happen in the 
second and third round they never really recover from, and they’re actually what makes 
the boxer go down in the tenth round. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
DB: 
And I think there is a bit of some of these things that may happen in people’s residency or 
early experience, if there’s really not a way to deal with them and kind of figure out how 
that fits into your view of things. I think they do linger and people don’t ever forget that.  
 
Physician Oral History: Doug Barnhart 
Page 23 
 
 
I mean, some of these, you know, experiences when I see my friends that we’re residents 
together, I mean we still remember some of those patients. And everybody remembers 
the first patient where they had a technical problem and it hurt them. And you can 
remember it about your peers.  
 
[47:13] 
 
 
So, there is a bit of how your mentors help you through that, that makes a difference in 
what it’s going to look like for 20 years.  
 
LG: 
And of course, the mentors probably teach whatever it is that they learned –  
 
DB: 
Yeah; well but some figure it out. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
DB: 
Yeah, I can distinctly remember one of my co-residents having a technical complication 
that resulted in a patient’s death. And it was with a particular monitoring line that you 
feed in through the vein, it goes into the artery and the lung. And they use it to measure 
pressures and critical low patients. And it ruptured that artery of the lung, and he bled to 
death.  
 
 
And it was a huge issue in the hospital, because it was one of the prominent surgeon’s 
patients. And we have a morbidity and mortality conference where these things are 
reviewed, and it was pretty clear, but he was dreading going into this, because you were 
anticipating that this guy would be crucified.  
 
 
And I could distinctly remember, because he presented that case. And the very first hand 
was the chairman of surgery, who asked him very specifically, he kind of said, “Well 
when that happened, did he cough up blood?”  
 
 
And I kind of thought, “Well that was a really strange question to ask.” 
 
 
And then he just followed up with, “Because when I did this last year, and this happened, 
that’s what happened.” 
 
 
And it was kind of this immediate sea-change of okay, it’s now no longer you – we’re 
going to talk about how dangerous this device is, and how we all need to be circumspect 
about whether we decide to use it, because they’re intrinsically dangerous and even the 
most experienced person has this happen.  
 
 
I still remember thinking about like, there’s a rescue swimmer in the water for that kid. 
 
 
And again, I think that’s one of those moments where if that had shifted the other way, I 
don’t actually know what that guy’s career would have looked like. 
 
Physician Oral History: Doug Barnhart 
Page 24 
 
LG: 
Right. He would have sustained that moral injury –  
 
DB: 
So, yeah, yeah; right, yeah. 
 
LG: 
For the rest of his life.  
 
DB: 
Yeah, so. 
 
LG: 
I mean, he probably did anyway. 
 
DB: 
Yeah, right. 
 
LG: 
But at least it was –  
 
DB: 
Well there’s a bit of this is a dangerous business we do. 
 
LG: 
Yeah. 
 
DB: 
And so, yeah. 
 
[49:33] 
 
LG: 
Interesting. Interesting. 
 
 
There’s an interesting term I’ve come across: “witness to suffering.” 
 
DB: 
Um-hmm. 
 
LG: 
Witnesses to suffering, which goes back to what you were talking about –  
 
DB: 
Yeah, yeah. 
 
LG: 
You know, getting back to the patient suffering, and kind of just being –  
 
DB: 
Yeah, for sure. 
 
LG: 
In that group. 
 
DB: 
Yeah. 
 
LG: 
So, those two concepts are –  
 
DB: 
Yeah, I think for sure –  
 
LG: 
Very usable – the witness to suffering –  
 
Physician Oral History: Doug Barnhart 
Page 25 
 
DB: 
That’s real.  
 
LG: 
And the moral injury. 
 
 
Well what else would you like the general public to know about what it’s like to be a 
surgeon in the 21st century? 
 
DB: 
I think there’s, you know, it’s still very gratifying and I’m glad to be able to do that, to 
help families and kids. 
 
 
I mean, I think you know, we’re in an era where you hear a lot of people complain about 
little things that bother them, right? Whether it’s electronic medical record – you could 
spend about five minutes in a hospital before you find somebody complaining about the 
electronic medical record, which is a sign that they’re worth complaining about.  
 
 
But you know, people are anxious about what the government is going to do with 
reimbursements, and regulations, and there’s all these things. And you’ll hear people say, 
“Well you know, these things are so bad you’d be crazy to go into medicine.” And I just–  
 
 
 
What I always tell undergrads (or anybody that’s interested), I’m like look, if what you 
want to do in medicine is care for sick people, that’s never going to change. And you 
know, and that’s the part that’s incredibly gratifying. I mean, there’s – you know, I tell 
people, I’m like, “I’ve got the best job in the world. Like why wouldn’t I want to do 
this?” 
 
 
So, I think there – I mean, there is; I mean, it’s a privilege. I mean, it’s a privilege to be 
able to enter into lives when people are vulnerable, to have been fortunate to get this 
special training, where you can actually do something that’s unique for them. 
 
[51:34] 
 
 
Yeah, so you know; I mean, yeah it would be great if we could get rid of the electronic 
medical record, but it’s not going to go away –  
 
[Laughter] 
 
 
 
You know, so just – every job has got some parts that aren’t that fun. But our good parts 
are way better than anybody else’s job.  
 
LG: 
I have to say almost everybody I’ve interviewed has mentioned electronic medical 
records –  
 
[Laughter] 
 
DB: 
No kidding! Like I say, because they are worth complaining about. 
 
Physician Oral History: Doug Barnhart 
Page 26 
 
LG: 
Yeah. 
 
DB: 
Yeah. 
 
LG: 
Yeah, good. Well is there anything else that you would like to add, or that you would 
think is important to –  
 
DB: 
No, thanks. Thanks to the –  
 
LG: 
Talk about. 
 
DB: 
Kids that I got to take care of, they’re what make it fun. The only thing I’d tell anybody 
that wanted to be a doctor is you should definitely be a children’s doctor. I mean, there is 
a fun part of – kids are tough, they are fun to play with, and you know, there’s –  
 
LG: 
Did you know you were going to do pediatric surgery? Or how did [??] –  
 
DB: 
Well it’s interesting – I got into that through kind of a strange series of events. I thought I 
wanted to do surgery. And when I was an undergrad I got picked (through the Boy 
Scouts) to go to Antarctica. And there was nobody medical in my family, so I, you know, 
was kind of this random undergrad, trucking along at Hopkins. And the chief of pediatric 
surgery at Hopkins happened to be an Eagle Scout. So, just out of the blue he saw this in 
the paper and just wrote me a letter and said, “You ought to come down and spend some 
time with me. And I think if you’re going to be a doctor you ought to be a pediatric 
surgeon.” 
 
 
And I went – his name was Alex Haller (he subsequently passed away). But I went down 
and watched him. He was chief of pediatric surgery at Hopkins, so he was, you know, 
everything anybody could want academically. But I watched him sit in a crib and talk to 
Dr. Three-Year-Old. And I thought, “That’s what I want to be.” 
 
LG: 
Awesome. 
 
DB: 
He was a good guy. 
 
LG: 
That’s awesome. I think working with kids would be one of the –  
 
DB: 
Yeah, it’s an awesome job.  
 
LG: 
The other thing – kids are so honest. 
 
DB: 
Yeah. 
 
LG: 
[Laughs] And they say funny things.  
 
DB: 
They do [laughs]; they will tell you what they think.

LG: 
Yeah. 
 
DB: 
And they’ll tell you what they think of you, and yeah – you can’t fool them. You can’t 
fool kids or dogs, I think Mark Twain said that, right?  
 
LG: 
That’s awesome. 
 
DB: 
Yeah, so anyway. 
 
LG: 
Okay. 
 
DB: 
Alright. 
 
LG: 
Well I’m going to go ahead and do my closing tag. 
 
DB: 
Okay. 
 
LG: 
Okay. I’ve been talking to Dr. Doug Barnhart, at his home here in Salt Lake City. And 
my name is Lisa Gabbert, and today is December 19th, 2019.  
 
 
Thank you very much. 
 
DB: 
Awesome; my pleasure.
