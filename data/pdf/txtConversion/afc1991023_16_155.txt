TX01: Drove down route 70 west to Marlton to K—Mart. On the way 
back I stopped at one of the produce stands, the one just east of 
the stand labelled Red Top Market G—Red Lion; 23GT and bought some 
peaches and asked the cashier (also the owner? seems like 
it) 
about the stand. He said the stand had been there for about 45 
years and he had been working there for 23 years. All 
of the 
produce except for bananas, 
lettuce, plums and grapes come from 
within a 10 mile radius. I plan on going bark within the next few 
days to take some pictures. 
TX02:Came back to headquarters. Mary came back shortly thereafter 
and wanted to go to Cassville to scope the Russian community. So 
I went with her. As we went onto the G—Pakim Pond Road; 27GT (still 
in the forest) we came across a couple of moped riders and Mary 
asked them some questions. They told us about dirt bikers and how 
they and some of the 4—wheel drive types race 
in the pits near 
Chatsworth. 
They practice for "enduros," one of which might be 
held there next weekend. 
The guy we were talking to, Dan Martin, 
lives 
in Lebanon 
Lakes and 
is a member of the Mercy First Aid Squad there. He 
rides he moped through the forest, sometimes on sand roads but is 
careful not to go on those where he might get stuck. 
He also 
likes to hunt deer and occasionally sees a fox in the area. 
TX03: Next we proceded east on route 70. Shortly past G—Lebanon 
Lakes; 27GT on the south side of the road there was a sign "Honey 
for Sale." Mary thinks this indicates a beekeeper. Maybe I should 
visit? 
Further along Route 70, past G—Country Lakes; 21GT is 
the 
Holly Haven Old Market. 
We turned off 70 onto a sand road. Past lots of dumping 
places. Mary says the public dump has been closed and so people 
have now convenient alternatives to dump their stuff. They also 
check to see what other people have dumped. 
Samuelson--83 Fieldnotes 
page 1 
Mary commented on the use of 
imported plants in yards, such 
as yucca. This was 
in the area near Hanover Furnace G—Pemberton: 
19GT. Passed Brindle Lake. Is this another lake community that 
should be contacted? 
G—Cookstown; 19GT: Tooties Home Cooking. 
G—New Egypt; 54GT: Tooties Diner. 
U—Pick Farm (just past New Egypt). 
Cemetery. 
Passed G—Iglesia San Antonio; 48GT, a Spanish church. Reached 
G—Cassville; 48GT. On Rt. 571, just north of 528, there 
is 
the 
Jackson Historical Museum. Looks like 
its seen better days. Also 
a cemetery nearby. 
TX04: A little further up the road 
is the G—Rova Farm; 48GT. area 
Paused in front of the St. Vladimir Russian Orthodox Infor mation 
Center, 928-2818. It wasn't open but we later found out it would 
be open on Sundays. Across the street is the office for the Rova 
Farms complex, 928-0920. Also nearby is the church, a restaurant 
and bar, with another gift shop. 
We started talking to a guy we met in the parking lot and he 
gave us some background on the place. He has been nominated for 
the board of trustees that oversees the restaurant/bar/social 
club. He commented that the trustees of several years ago 
misappropriated some funds and the place really went downhill. 
The outgoing group now has made some improvements and he thinks 
his group will do even more. They are trying to attract more 
young people to the club/group/church? All kinds are welcome--
Russia.ns, Czechs, Yugoslays, etc. 
He took us over the the gift shop and introduced us to the 
lady who ran the gift shop. She took us through the shop, 
pointing out the various items and where they came from. Most of 
the stuff was foreign made and when we pressed her for 
information on people in the area who make do embroidery, egg 
scratching, cooking, etc. she seemed to know very little. 
We walked into the restaurant. There were pictures of 
Pushkin, Tchaikovsky and Gogol 
in the lobby. We didn't go 
into 
the restaurant proper. 
A mass had just started but we weren't dressed for it. Mary 
may go back tomorrow to the 10:00 mass. The church 
is orthodox. 
Services are held standing up. Women should wear skirts and, 
if 
unmarried, have their heads covered. 
TX05: 
Drove back to G—Browns Mills; 21GT 
and had dinner at the 
International Cafe. This is an old dairy bar that is now run my 
Orientals. The old ice cream sign out by the road now has 
Chinese(?) characters. (Korean is sometimes written in Chinese 
script.) 
The place 
is 
run by Koreans, a woman who takes the 
orders, her husband who seems to be the cook, her daughter who 
Samuelson--83 Fieldnotes 
page 2 
set the table, and a little boy. There are a lot of American 
foods: egg and bacon breakfasts, burgers, cheesesteaks, chicken 
(including honey—dipped chicken). The oriental specialties 
included sukiyaki, ribs, fried rice, monde (sp?) a kind of fried 
dumpling with cabbage and maybe pork. 
This place definitely 
needs to be investigated further.

TX01: Carl and I went to visit and photograph the market I went 
to yesterday. It is called the Green Top Farm Market G—Red 
Lion; 23GT and 
it sells fruits, vegetables, flowers and shrubs. 
The owner is William M. Moore, Sr. Seems like most of the selling 
is handled by his son, David, and David's wife, Diane. David also 
seemed to handle most of the PR work with us while his father 
stayed in the background, although Carl talked to him a little 
bit at the end. 
The market is 
located on route 70 about a mile west of the 
intersection with 206. The address is: Green Top Market, Route 
70, Vincentown, NJ 08088. David Moore's address is Summit Drive 
Vincentown, NJ 08088. 
William has been at this location for 21 years. Before that 
he had a stand down on Route 9 in Bayville. The stand 
is open 
from Easter until Halloween. It opens again briefly in December 
to sell Christmas trees and greenery. 
9 
The pumpkins are just beginning to come 
in. David said to 
come back 
in a few weeks and the whole yard will be filled with 
pumpkin. Trucks too. They will sell about 15 tons of pumpkin 
during the fall season. They had the small ornamental kind of 
pumpkins plus some larger ones called Hubbard squash. David said 
these are used for pies. You cut them in half, bake until tender, 
then remove the seeds (and remove the peel 
too, 
I assume). Then 
you mash them and mix with spices like you would with canned 
pumpkin. He also said that within a few weeks there would be 
corn stalks and Indian corn at the market. 
David's kids, David Jr. and Danielle were around too. They 
liked having their pictures taken, were real hams, as Carl said. 
David said that some people had been stopping at the stand for so 
many years that they had watched him grow up and now were 
watching his kids grow up. 
It was great documenting this place. It 
is 
less 
commercialized then the Red Top Market just down the road. The 
Samuelson--83 Fieldnotes 
page 4 
people were very friendly and having Carl there helped a lot.

TXO1: Headed off into the wilds of section 3, Elaine's territory, 
with Elaine. Stopped at Buck and Emma's Coffee Shop in 
G—Chatsworth; 27GT The people there have owned it for only 5 
months, having come from Fort Dix. The place 
is 
rather small and 
gloomy, has a rather tired air about it. The kitchen looks very 
residential, with cabinets, a domestic—like refrigerator. There 
was a small TV on, a playpen nearby. Piney Power sticker on the 
wall. An old chest—type Pepsi cooler. 
TX02: Went down to G—Green Bank; 26GT and took some pictures of the 
Green Bank Inn, a local tavern. Intended to go east on Rt. 542 to 
Wading River but discovered that the bridge was closed for 
repairs (for a year, we later discovered). 
So we had to detour to G—New Gretna; 15GT. Tried to locate 
George Heinrichs, a sneakbox builder. Got his phone number and 
will pass 
it on to Jens. Took some pictures of the New Gretna 
Bake Shop (closed on Mondays) and also of an interesting lamp 
post across the street. It had a little fish on 
it. 
Passed a cemetery on route 542 about 1/2 mile west of New 
Gretna. Then another about 1/2 east of Wading River. Stopped and 
looked around. It's called the French Cemetery because many 
members of the French family are buried there. Late 18th/early 
19th century. Has a memorial plaque. 
New Gretna has some interesting restaurants, the New Gretna 
House and Allen's Clam Bar. Allen's has been highly recommended 
in a local 
restaurant guide. 
In the local superette market in New Gretna we saw a poster 
for an Old Time Barnegat Bay Decoy and Gunning Show, 10/8/83, 9-
5. Tip Seaman Park., Rt. 9 and Lakeside Dr., Tuckerton, NJ. Rain 
location: Pinelands High School, Nugentown Rd., Tuckerton. The 
sponsor is the Ocean Co. Dept. of Parks and Recreation. Phone is 
296-5606. 
TX03: Saw another cemetery in Smithville on Rt. 9 G—Galloway:09GT. 
Samuelson--83 Fieldnotes 
page 6 
Then another 1 mile 
further south, near Oceanville. 
We had lunch at Historic Smithville Village. It 
is touristy 
kind of s.pot. Clapboard buildings housing many different kinds of 
shops--bookstore, brass, souvenirs, coffee/teas/deli/gourmet 
foods, Norman Rockwell. Ate at Joe's Place. Lots of senior 
citizens around. One lady said they were with tour groups that 
had been to Atlantic City. 
Elaine and I were both enchanted and dismayed by the place. 
On the one hand, there are lots of 
interesting things to buy. 
There may be some interpretative stuff as well but we didn't see 
it. 
The village is clean, 
looks very prosperous. Yet it 
is very 
contrived. I'm not sure how much 
it actually has to do with the 
Pinelands. There were some books on the Pines in the bookstore. I 
bought the Pinelands cookbook, a restaurant guide, and some 
Jersey Devil posters to take to friends in Philadelphia. Elaine 
bought some back issues of South Jersey Magazine which may have 
interesting articles. 
TX04: Next stop was G—Harry's Farm Market; 05GT, 945 W. White Horse 
Pike (Rt. 30) 
in Egg Harbor City. The owner is Lena Massarelli. 
She 
is originally from Hammonton and has operated the market 
there for 13 years. Her husband was around too. The strategy was 
that I asked to take some pictures and as I was prowling around 
Elaine did the talking. The market was enticing because there 
were lots of plaster yard decorations there: Snow White and the 
dwarfs, Virgin Mary, elves. Her son makes them; he 
lives down the 
road 
in and has a shop on Rt. 30. You can't miss 
it! 
The Massarellis sell fruit, vegetables, flowers, shrubs. One 
of the more interesting items was a pitcher gourd. 
It can be made 
into a bird feeder by allowing it to dry and cutting a hole 
in 
it. I have a picture of Mr. Massarelli holding it. 
Along Rt. 30, just west of Egg Harbor City, was Kitty's 
Market. It had interesting road signs that I should go back and 
photograph. Also along this route was a sign for a cider mill. I 
also want to take 
a. 
picture of the White Top Market (?) because 
it had a big chicken on top of 
it. 
Another cemetery on Route 30 after Egg Harbor City. 
TX05: The big find of the day was Emma's Farm and Garden Center 
G—Elwood; 12GT. 
It 
is owned and operated by Ralph C. Putiri and 
located at 826 White Horse Pike (Elwood), Hammonton, NJ 08037 
G-11GT (609)561-4548.. Again, we used the strategy of me asking to 
take pictures and Elaine starting to talk. Ralph and his cousins 
Floyd Bird and Claude Angelo, were running the place. 
As I 
started to take pictures, Floyd talked to me. He wanted to know 
more about the project and the Library of Congress. I told him 
about the various other places the LC had worked: Rhode Island, 
Blue Ridge Parkway, Nevada, Chicago. He was impressed with all 
Samuelson--83 Fieldnotes 
page 7 
the camera equipment and was rather amazed that people got paid 
to do what we were doing. 
The market has the usual array of fruits, vegetables, 
shrubs, flowers but also some Halloween dolls. The heads had 
plastic pumpkins and with cloth and plastic bodies. Ralph later 
told us that some lady nearby in Nesco makes these dolls. I'll 
have to get her name from him. The market also seels cider (made 
in Hammonton), and homemade preserves, jam, pickled vegetables, 
etc. Floyd pointed out to me that the market has a second story 
with windows. When they move the place or build a new building 
they will use this place for apartments. 
Next to enter the scene was Ralph's father, Salvatore 
Putiri. Although Ralph actually owns the place what Salvatore 
says, goes. He seemed very eager to talk to us and we gave them 
our 
names and phone numbers (regretting that our business cards 
were not ready yet!) and mentioned the possibility of coming back 
to 
interview them. All 
of the men seemed to 
like the idea, 
especially if we came in the evening. Salvatore really got into 
the topic of history, especially family history. He mentioned 
that the old town of Amatol was in ruins just a few thousand feet 
behind the market and that Ralph used to play there as a kid. 
Amatol disappeared sometime after World War I; 
it was a 
munitions producing area. 
Sal's parents came to the U.S. from Italy in the 
late 19th 
century and settled in the Hammonton area. Hammonton was 
originally inhabited by English settlers until the Italians moved 
in 
in the late 19th century. The parents first lived 
in a small 
house with their 13 children, then moved. More about this later. 
Sal 
used to live in a one—room house next to where the market is 
now. 
It had an outside toilet. The one room now is the kitchen of 
a greatly enlarged house. Ralph took us over there to meet his 
twin brother, also called Salvatore. The house had a hymnal on 
the piano as well as a songbook, "Songs That Gideons Sing." Ralph 
is a born—again Christian who was raised a Catholic but now 
attends a Baptist church (but is not a member of the 
denomination). 
Meanwhile, bark at the market, a guy named Charlie Palmieri, 
a cousin, showed up. He 
is a guy 
in his 60s and he and Sal Sr. 
were talking about how they could tell 
really big "lies." We 
should try to get him to the interview session too. 
TX06: Ralph decided that he really wanted to show us this house 
where his grandparents lived. 
It 
is on G—Pine Road; 11GT about 2 
miles north of Rt. 30, on the east side near a reservoir. I took 
pictures and Elaine sketched the layout. 
It was quite overgrown 
and looked as though 
it had been broken into and "appropriated" 
at various times. 
In one of the auxiliary buildings, 
it 
looked 
as though people were still 
living there. 
Samuelson--83 Fieldnotes 
page 8 
He next took us to the family cemetery on Rt. 30, just about 
a 1/2 mile west o£ Pine Rd G—Hammonton: 11GT. As we were driving 
down Pine Rd. 
to get there he keep pointing out all of the places 
were he had relatives. When we got to the family plot at the 
cemetery (?Oak Road (or Lane) Cemetery?) we saw that all the 
plots were labelled DeMarco. That is his grandmother's family. 
Looks as though he 
is related to Garfield DeMarco. 
This kind of figures because they really disliked the 
Pinelands Commission, said it started out OK but that now they 
won't let anyone do anything. This is 
in stark contrast to Mary 
Ann Thompson's comments that the Commission is giving building 
permits to all 
kinds of developers. Maybe the Iocalites are 
really getting squeezed out of the picture. 
Ralph directed us around Hammonton proper. Showed us St. 
Joseph's Catholic Church which has a new, modern building. They 
will have information on the Our Lady of Mt. Carmel Society. 
There was a monument erected by the society on Pine Road, where 
the annual procession used to start. It 
is always held on July 
16th. The Society was started by Italian immigrants. Ralph also 
showed us his church and some of the nice homes, old and new, 
in 
the area. He talked about how hard the people in Hammonton worked 
to make their money but that now they are becoming rather 
snobbish. Much of their wealth comes from blueberries. But they 
do have a strong work attitude. There about 15,000 people 
in 
Hammonton. 
As we headed back to Emma's Market, Ralph pointed out the 
2nd house his grandparents lived in, a very substantial 
looking 
house now owned by his cousin Mark Anthony DeMarco. It 
is next to 
the Farmer's Daughter Market on Route 30. He 
is a lawyer and also 
runs the market. 
TX07: Ralph had us head east on G—Moss Mill Road; 12GT which runs 
parallel to the White Horse Pike. We were looking for traces 
visible from the road of the old town of Amatol. He also showed 
us the settlement of Black Jews in Elwood. There is a group of 
about 5 houses, all 
very well kept, and a synagogue, Adat Beyt 
Mosheh. The Friday evening service is at 7 P.M. Saturday morning 
services are at 9:00 A.M. 
There 
is also a synagogue in 
Hammonton, Temple Beth—El, at Bellevue and Liberty Streets. Ralph 
told us that the Black Jewish community tried to emigrate as a 
group to Israel a few years ago but that Israel wouldn't let them 
in. 
Ralph gave 
Elaine lots of information on his spiritual 
rebirth. He also mentioned a farmer in Germania (between Egg 
Harbor City and Port Republic. He has a packing house for 
potatoes and a big 
sign that says "The earth 
is the Lord's and 
the fullness there—of." This farmer's name 
is Joe Sahl and three 
of his sons are pastors. I took a picture of one of his potato 
bags back at the market. 
Samuelson--83 Fieldnotes 
page 9 
Ralph mentioned that one of the better Italian restaurants 
in 
the area is Joe's Maplewood in Hammonton. 
TX08: Upon leaving the Hammonton area we headed for Chesilhurst. 
There I saw a very interesting nativity scene on the White Horse 
Pike near G—West Atco; 31GT. 
TX09: Saw a tiny cemetery on Rt. 541 between G—Medford; 18GT and 
Medford Lakes, across from a Presbyterian church. 
Interesting Quaker meetinghouse in Medford. 
Medford is a neat place. Lots of 
interesting yards. At 12 
Haines Ave. there is a fabulous status of the Virgin Mary. At 
Haines Ave. and Allen Ave there is another neat yard, this one 
with one of those large blue glass balls, 
like a big Christmas 
ornament. Jens thinks they are used to give a wide—screen picture 
of the yard. I think they look kind of weird. Yardscapes are 
going to be very interesting. At first I figured all 
these 
plaster decorations were just kitsch. I shouldn't make such 
aesthetic judgements. They are obviously very important to a lot 
of people. 
TX10: Ended up the day at the G—Red Lion; 23GT Diner, intersection 
of Rt. 70 at Rt. 206. Had gone there for breakfast on Su6day with 
Carl which was quite good. The diner has a large menu but not all 
that good. Will use the experience to update my restaurant file. 
It worked very well going with Elaine. Tandem 
fieldwork is 
great. One person can drive while the other navigates and keeps 
an eye out for interesting things and takes notes. It felt like a 
very successful foray. I can't wait to follow up some of these 
leads.

TX01: These notes may be more like house notes rather than 
fieldnotes. Chris Bethmann, the Lebanon State Forest G-Woodland: 
27GT superintendent came over and told me about Jock Allen, the 
former superintendent who who was 
in charge of the forest for 
forty years from the 1920s to 1960s. The forest's naturalist's 
grandfather knows Allen and Chris has always wanted to meet him. 
So Chris will try to set up something so that we can both go talk 
to Allen. 
Chris also has lots of old maps of the forest that he 
is willing, 
even eager, to show me. He also has a short history of the forest 
area. I asked him about the name, Four Mile G-Woodland: 27GT for 
this area. He thinks 
it was probably four miles from Halfway 
G-Woodland: 27GT, which used to be an old stage stop that was 
halfway between Philadelphia and the shore. He isn't sure of this 
explanation but it makes some sense. (Remember that Mayo's 
restaurant's full name 
is Mayo's Halfway House.) 
He mentioned 
some stories about the CCC (Civilian Conservation Corps) which 
used to work 
in the area. There are also some ruins in the 
forest, especially near the McDonald Branch G-Woodland: 27GT: a 
sawmill, some houses. There was black CCC group in the area that 
used to run a still near Mt. Misery G-Woodland: 27GT. Chris says he 
heard the guys used to call their moonshine "Beatyourmama" 
because it would make you so drunk that you even beat your mama. 
Another in-house "interview" was a phone conversation I had with 
Nanny St. Charles, the recreation officer for the Evesham 
Township G-16GT. I had called the township office to find out about 
fairs and festivals. She told me about a pumpkin festival she is 
planning for October 29, 
1983. This 
is the first year for it so 
it may be a kind of festival-in-creation. The local PTAs and 
churches are involved. There will 
be live music on a flatbed 
truck decorated by the Garden Club of Marlton G-Evesham: 16GT, a 
costume parade with awards, a gong show for adults with cash 
prizes, a pumpkin decorating contest for children, beer and food, 
arts and crafts. She sounded very enthusiastic about the event 
and wanted to know if I knew of anyone who could participate, 
e.g., musicians. I told her I had only been here for one week but 
would keep my eyes open. 
Samuelson--83 Fieldnotes 
page 11 
I told her about the folklife project and she sounded very 
interested and invited me to visit her at her office in Marlton. 
Although Marlton is technically outside of the pinelands area I 
will still try to visit her. She may have some good contacts, 
especially with pumpkin farmers. 
I made a brief foray into town and saw several things I want to 
explore further: the old schoolhouse in Browns Mills and the 
church and cemetery across the street from it; that 
junk/appliance dealer just outside of Browns Mills with the great 
yard decorations; the old church (looks abandoned) 
in New Lisbon 
Pemberton: 21GT; the two houses next to 
it, 
one with a bird feeder 
on top of a ten foot tree stump and one with plaster yard 
decorations of birds. Maybe someday I can get Joe Doyle, the 
postmaster, to take me on a tour around the town. 
Elaine just handed me a card with a new cemetery notation on 
it: 
the Batsto-Pleasant Mills churchyard, between Batsto and pleasant 
Mills on Rt. 543. Dates to at least the 1780s.

TX01: Mary Hufford and I went to visit Frank Banish, a planner 
for G—Pemberton; 21GT Township. He works in the municipal buildings 
on Rt. 530. While we were waiting for him we started talking to 
Earl Piper, a code inspector. One of his jobs 
is 
to issue 
summonses to people who dump garbage illegally on the back 
roads or even those who 
let 
it accumulate in their yards. He 
showed us some photographs of dumping and Mary asked how he found 
out who was doing the dumping. Earl said that you would be 
suprised at how people leave things in their garbage that have 
their names on 
it. Frank Banish arrived and Mary and I had a long 
talk with him about the township: where various ethnic enclaves 
exist, architecturally interesting structures, the area's 
development as a longtime resort community, the existence and 
residence pattern so of 
local 
"Pineys." Towards the end of the 
conversation Earl Piper entered in and started talking to me as 
Mary wrapped things up with Frank. Earl may very well end up 
being a great informant. He 
lives on Magnolia Road where there 
are 
lots of farmers and produce stands. He raises blueberries (52 
acres) but is getting rather tired of 
it, especially when there 
are bad years for the crops. He may get development credits for 
some of the land or give it to his 27—year old son who 
is very 
eager to be a farmer. Earl 
is also has a real estate license and 
does tax work. He seemed very amiable to talking to me 
in 
the 
future. 
TX02: 
In the afternoon I went to Plumsted and Jackson Townships. 
I wanted to visit the municpal offices to see what kinds of 
local 
contacts I could get. First stop was G—New Egypt; 54GT. Went 
through town to find the Elks lodge that is having a pig roast on 
Saturday, 9/24. Don't think I can make the pig roast but I did 
take a picture of the sign. 
I had to stop at the post office to find out where the 
Plumsted township office was. Once I got there I thought I was 
in 
the wrong place because upon entering the building I was right in 
the middle of a courtroom. Luckily no court was 
in session but 
it 
took a little sleuthing work to find the office. Two ladies were 
working there and they gave me a little background on the area. 
Samuelson--83 Fieldnotes 
page 13 
It, 
is mainly agricultural, with grains and vegetables being the 
primary crops. There 
is also some horse raising going on. They 
suggested I talk to John DeMeo, the mayor, who was across the 
street in his place of work, Johnny's Barber Shop. 
DeMeo was talking very intently to someone when I came 
in 
so 
I had time to scope out the place while waiting for him to 
finish. Several men were 
in 
line to buy lottery tickets. There 
were two barber's chairs and a mini-vegetable stand on the front 
porch with beans and tomatoes. DeMeo was talking about local 
issues and politics; I heard him mention something about a 
senator. He seemed to be an archtypal 
local politico type. He 
seemed very busy but still had time to give me the names of some 
local people who might be helpful: a Mrs. Mount on Evergreen 
Road, an ex-schoolteacher; Pat Gale Wright, a member of the 
historical society; George Emley, a farmer, 
lives on High Bridge 
Rd. at the end of a long lane; and Dayton Hopkins, a lawyer who 
come from an old family and 
is also a member of the historical 
society. 
Passed Iglesia San Antonio Claret and recorded the times 
of 
the masses to give to Bonnie. 
TX03: Headed east to G-Jackson; 48GT Township. Again I had to stop 
at the post office to find out where the municipal buildings 
were. The phone book only said Rt. 528 and I didn't know where on 
the route they were. No street numbers in these woods, unless 
someone lives 
in a borough, I think. At the office the 
receptionist directed me to the town clerk's office. The clerk, 
Mr. Miller, has been out for two months on sick leave; he 
is also 
the town historian. However, three ladies who worked 
in his 
office were very helpful. They gave me a booklet on the history 
of the township and lots of contacts: 
Gypsies -- Rt. 526 in Shady Lake Trailer Park 
Oriental farmer -- Rt. 571, Prospertown-Toms River Rd. 
John Smatusik -- storyteller 
Alexander Platt, Jr.-- member of the historical commission 
and part of the group responsible for relocating an old 
schoolhouse 
Viola Brown -- a native 
Sue Stamos -- old schoolteacher (?), now a bus coordinator 
Sylvia Rosenauer -- former school principal 
Frank Holman -- administrator with the state (formerly with 
the county) 
Peggy Hein and Elaine Murray -- Irish-American Club 
Joseph Graziano -- Italian-American Club on County Line Rd., 
Rt. 526 
Aino Mere -- Estonian Club vice-president. works for 
Lakewood School District 
Cemetery on Rt. 527 south, just north of Whitesville. 
Mary wants us to do some contacting 
at the township level 
who can do the same kind of thing that Banish did for Pemberton.

Plumsted is very small and had no planner but the Dayton fellow 
might serve the same function. Jackson Township's set—up looked 
rather elaborate so I will call or go bark and see what I come up 
with.

TX01: Spent the morning dealing with administrative matters: the 
janitorial service, setting up the project's bank account. 
TX02: Then I called the community relations officer at 
G—Ft. Dix; 
19GT and got an appointment for an interview in the afternoon. 
The officer is a civilian employee, Helen Fasik. She 
is 
an 
older lady, probably in her late 50s. She has worked at the post 
for 33 years, mainly as a reporter for the post newspaper. At 
first I wasn't sure how helpful she was going to be. 
It seemed as 
though her boss, Lt. Col. MacNab was really the person who knew 
the most about the post related to the community in environmental 
terms. I met him briefly and was really impressed with his 
enthusiasm for the area and interest in responding to community 
needs. Will 
interview him next week. 
Where Mrs. Fasik was most helpful was 
in giving me a tour 
around the base. We went out to some of the "wilderness" areas, 
the ranges and bivouac sites, obstacle course (near a really 
beautiful bog), and the more built—up areas, 
including a mini— 
museum. Ft. Dix has hired a historian/museum curator. 
The army 
has also been interested in history. 
Got some brochures on the history of the base and 
its 
current use. Will be 
interested in seeing what MacNab has to say.

TX01:Elaine and went to Egg Harbor City to 
investigate several 
community events. On our way down Rt. 536, past G—Chatsworth; 27GT 
we saw some cranberry harvesting. We had to walk about 1/4 mile 
along a dirt road to where the action was. The contrast between 
the 
blue sky 
reflected in the flooded field, the 
red of the 
cranberries, and the green trees was striking. The air was cool 
and clear and 
it almost felt as if I was at the ocean. I 
basically just took pictures since the harvesters were working 
very intently. I tried to get several shots of one guy who was 
wading out in the thick of the cranberries. (The rest of the 
workers were along the fringes, swinging in a big boom.) 
TX02: The first event we visited was the Apple Festival at St. 
John's United Church of Christ on London St. 
in G—Egg Harbor City; 
05GT. We 
introduced ourselves to Rev. Dr. Richard A. Ruof, the 
pastor of the church. He seemed glad to see us and introduced us 
to the coordinator of the festival, Ruth Ellen Gronlund. She told 
us about the event, how this was its 6th year and that it was one 
event that involved the entire congregation. However, 
it did seem 
that it was the women who were doing most of the work. There were 
a few young men present, one holding a baby, and some elderly 
men, but the rest of the crowd was women and children. As Elaine 
and I discussed later, 
in many churches the women negotiate the 
social side of things and the men attend to the spiritual. 
The church started as a Reform Church, due to Egg Harbor 
City's heavy Germanic settlement. They have some active programs 
to help the poor and this event was not only social and unifying, 
but also a fundraiser via the sale of raffle tickets for quilts 
and an afghan, Christmas items, books, plants and food. On the 
first Sunday 
in October they have a Harvest Home observance where 
they bring the fruits of the harvest into the church for a 
blessing. This will 
be very interesting to see because I'm not 
sure how many of these people are farmers. This particular part 
of Egg Harbor City looks suburbanish but several of the ladies 
did indicate that they had some land around their houses. 
Mrs. Gronlund introduced us to Helen Zimmer, who may turn 
Samuelson--83 Fieldnotes 
page 17 
Y 
out to be a real goldmine of 
information. She knows all 
about the 
plants in the area, just the kind of native naturalist we need. 
She does does lots of cooking, canning, etc. and commented on how 
people today just aren't used to doing it, 
so they don't do 
it. 
She also says that she makes dandelion wine and later laughed 
that "they'll read 
in the paper (lots of people think we're 
reporters) that the president of the women's guild has a little 
nip." I assured her that that wouldn't happen but joked that it 
might be good for her image 
if 
it did. We told Mrs. Zimmer that 
we would be back to interview her. 
Next we headed toward the quilt display and Elaine 
registered for the raffle. There was a table just loaded with 
"junk:" costume jewelry, banks, doo-dads, whatchamacallits. We 
proceeded to the plant table where several 
ladies showed us dried 
plants they called pennies from heaven G-Egg Harbor City: 05GT. If 
done correctly, they are dried and easily stripped of an under 
and upper leaf which leaves a thin, translucent layer. 
If the 
plant is properly prepared by drying in the oven the outer layers 
can just be rubbed off by pressing between the thumb and fingers 
but these samples were rather "green" and had to be slowly 
stripped and this process often shredded the delicate inner

ed several times that we could tell 
she lived alone 
e talked so much. She really did seem to enjoy being 
with people. Church activities must give her quite an outlet. 
Like Mrs. Zimmer, she seemed to know a lot about plants and 
mentioned that she lived on 3 acres and had some wooded area. She 
may be another interesting person to talk to. When we returned to 
the table later she was with a lady named Marie Alber who was 
much older, 
in her 70s. When asked for their names and addresses 
they made rather joking comments about being careful who they 
give them to and this served as a catalyst for a very serious 
exchange of stories about people finding sneaky ways of getting 
into people's houses such as asking to how use the phone because 
of a broken car. The stories were both generalized and related to 
specific incidents in their neighborhoods. 
The children at the festival w 
that was a game whereby a chit

Also available for the kids was a face painting stand and a 
balloon concession. Other items for sale included preserves and 
jams (sold out by the time we got there), potholders, fancy dolls 
and the like. The food stand had apples, meatball sandwiches, hot 
dogs, cookies, brownies, desserts, cider, and 
orange drink 
(served from equipment borrowed from MacDonalds). 
Despite this being labelled an apple festival the event 
didn't really celebrated the fruit as such. There were signposts 
along the flagstone paths with names such as "Winesap Way" and 
there were several baskets of apples near the food stand. 
In the 
room where the puppet show was held there were also some apple 
cut—outs on the wall. It seems that the apple 
is used as a theme 
because it 
is harvested in the fall and the area is agricultural. 
Whether or not there are other religious overtones is unclear; 
the only ones I can think of 
is Adam and Eve! 
TX03: We left the church and visited a very different kind of 
event, the Skin and Bones Day of the 1983 G—Renault Winery; 13GT 
Grape Harvest Festival. For eight weeks the winery does Saturday 
celebrations, such as Greek Day, Bavarian Day, Italian Day, Louis 
Renault's Birthday. They get about a thousand people who take the 
winery tour, eat, participate in grape stomping contests, take 
hay rides and buy wine. Of course, BUY WINE. The event, as 
Christine had heard, was a commercial endeavor. It 
is promotion 
for the winery. But it 
is community—oriented, as these things 
must be. I think the choice of groups to celebrate is partly 
influenced by the ethnicity of the area's residents (lots of 
Germans in Egg Harbor City, Italians in Hammonton). Some groups 
even approach the winery wanting to participate, such as Greeks 
from Atlantic City. 
We 
interviewed Teresa Litely, the special events 
coordinator. The winery has been there since the 19th century and 
is the oldest one 
in the U.S. 
in continuous operation. This 
harvest festival 
is 6 years old and appears to be quite a 
success. The crowd was quite different from the one at the 
church. It was more formal and aloof. People didn't know each 
other except for the group they came with. There were couples, 
foursomes, some senior citizens, not a whole lot of kid. There 
was an antique car display and the owners kept to themselves off 
in one corner of the area. There was a guitarist who we taped as 
he was introducing the grape stomping contest. 
The contest attracted a lot of attention. There were three 
eager participants and Elaine did her best to tape the sloshing 
noises of the stompers and the laughter and comments of the 
crowd. Shortly +,hereafter we 
left but only after I had purchased 
two house specialities, blueberry dunk (a variant of cold duck, 
the sparkling wine) and blueberry flavored champagne. 
TX04: We headed back up 563, hoping to make a roast beef supper 
we has seen advertised along the way. Just after crossing the 
Samuelson--83 Fieldnotes 
page 19 
G—Mullica River; 26GT on Pacemaker Bridge we saw a boy walking 
along the road with crab nets. Elaine stopped and interviewed 
him, Nagra and all, right alongside the road while I took 
pictures of them and the Mullica River. 
TX05: Finally we got to the firehouse in G—Lower Bank; 26GT. I took 
what I think will 
be some good shots of the roast beef supper 
sign up against the fire engine. Members of the volunteer fire 
company were helping to park cars and one guy, Warren, seemed 
especially interested in us. While standing in 
line we talked to 
one couple who lived seasonally in a trailer in one of the nearby 
campgrounds. The husband was a fire chief in Elizabeth, NJ and 
they spend their weekends from April to October in the Lower Bank 
area. Of course they support the local fire company and explained 
that the lack of industry 
in many areas means there just isn't a 
tax base to support such things as fire departments. The fire 
companies do several fundraising things each year: roast beef and 
spaghetti suppers, pancake breakfasts. At this one there was also 
a raffle for a duck decoy. 
In addition to sit down diners there were people lining up 
for take—out. Many hundreds would be served before the night was 
over (serving from 4-7 P.M.). The cost was $5 and there were tip 
cans on the tables so that the servers and busboys, children of 
firemen, could earn a little money. The food was average: roast 
beef slices, mashed potatoes with a little juice, well—cooked 
peas, coleslaw, rolls, coffee/tea/ice tea/water. Desserts were 
more elaborate with about 10 different pies (cranberry nut, 
blueberry, coconut cream, raisin, apple, cherry, etc.) as well 
as 
cakes, brownies and such. I tried to take some pictures but it 
was really hectic and I had the film speeds wrong. We decided it 
would be rather difficult to 
interview anyone there so we got 
Warren's name and phone number and may use him as a contact for 
later interviewing. 
Gained some interesting insights on the nature of community 
here. The people we talked to from Elizabeth who stayed 
in 
the 
trailer felt they were different from the "amateurs," the summer 
folk, as opposed to the April—October folk. Also, most of the 
people attending the dinner were senior citizens. People came, 
ate, talked a little, then left. The sense of esprit was probably 
more pronounced among the people actually doing the cooking, 
serving and dishwashing. 
We were rather lucky 
in picking three very different kinds 
of events to attend. The church festival was very personal, 
local, immediate, warm. Everyone knew everybody and was eager to 
make connections. The winery shindig was more distant but had a 
sense of vibrancy of 
its own. There were plenty of outsiders and 
people interacted very little 
even during the most cohesive 
event, the grape stomping contest. The dinner was sort of 
in— 
between, with more chatting between people but not the sense of 
camaraderie that I expected. Since so many people were present 
Samuelson--83 Fieldnotes 
page 20 
there was an assembly line approach to things and a rather 
hurried atmosphere. Some conversation was going on, and 
naturally, and there were small gatherings in the parking lot. 
But even this was interrupted because of the presence of so many 
cars.

TX01: Went out to G—Ft. Dix; 19GT to interview Kimberly Eandhaid, 
the Korean wife of Tony Eandhaid who is preparing to 
leave Ft. 
Dix for Officers Candidate School 
in North Carolina. Kimberly and 
their son Christopher will 
live in Pemberton until Tony 
is 
finished. Her address after October 10th will be c/o Breininger, 
10 2nd Ave., Pemberton, NJ. Phone: 896-2291. I looked this name 
up 
in the book and Mrs. Breininger's first name looks Korean. 
Kimberly grew up 
in South Korea and met her husband when she 
worked at a snack bar he visited while stationed in Korea. She 
is 
24, was married when she was 19. She speaks English fairly well 
but occasionally I had a problem understanding her. 
The interview began with some questions about the Korean 
community in the Ft,. Dix/Wrightstown/Browns Mills area. Several 
local Oriental food stores, such as Eugene's in Browns Mills and 
one 
in Wrightstown, serve as 
informal gathering places. Kimberly 
does ►ots of shopping there as she prepares lots of Korean food. 
She doesn't like American food. 
She told me that Haruko's Oriental food store 
in Browns 
Mills is more oriented towards the Japanese population. She 
doesn't like the Japanese because they conquered Korea at one 
point and governed it for 34 years. She doesn't think the Chinese 
in the area do much together. 
Another focal point is the Browns Mills Korean Baptist 
Church. Kimberly seems to really like the "chaplain," who I 
believe is Rev. 
Im. He may be the very best contact if we want to 
do 
intensive work with the Koreans in the area. 
Kimberly showed me several Korean artifacts. Since they are 
beginning to park up for their move things are kind of 
disorganized. She did have a beautiful embroidered screen with 
lettering on the back (in Chinese she thought) that was supposed 
to be a poem. Upstairs she showed me some wall hangings, 
bedspreads, baby blankets, and a traditional women's costume. She 
wears it to church on holidays such as Christmas, Thanksgiving 
Samuelson--83 Fieldnotes 
page 22 
and Easter. In Korea, only old women will wear it except for New 
Year's day when people go visiting. I tried to take some pictures 
of the bed spreads and costume but the light wasn't very good so 
I don't know how they will turn out. 
Kimberly said she was rather bored 
in New Jersey. She and 
her husband had lived in California for a while and she liked 
that better. She seemed an almost stereotypic Army wife. Probably 
doesn't get out much, her husband watches over her and doesn't 
want her to be away too much. 
It 
is OK for him to go out with his 
buddies but not her. She does seem to have substantial contacts 
in 
the Korean community. I also think she didn't really mind 
being away from her husband for 6 months, felt she would have 
more freedom for a while. 
She had wanted to cook some Korean food for Mary, who had 
made the initial contact with her last week. Because of the 
confusion of moving it didn't seem practical right now but we 
tenatively agreed to get together in a few weeks after she was 
settled 
in her new place. 
TX02: Kimberly offered to call the mother of a friend of hers, 
Mrs. Sun Key Kim, who might be 
interested in talking to me. I 
went to Mrs. Kim's house at 111 Harding Blvd. 
in G—Country Lakes; 
21GT Phone: 893-3805. The first thing I noticed about this rather 
substantial looking bungalow/tract house was the shoes left on 
the doorstep. I offered to leave my shoes there when Mrs. Kim 
came to the door and she appreciated the offer, so off went the 
shoes. I explained briefly that I was interested in all 
aspects 
of Korean life 
in the community but she seemed most interested in 
showing me some beautiful Korean furniture she had; wardrobes, 
dish cabinets, coffee table. They were beautiful and I attempted 
to take some pictures, but again the light was very poor. 
As I walked through the kitchen I saw what looked like 
Korean food on the table. I commented on how sorry I was to 
interrupt their lunch (Her son was also there; he looked about 16 
or 18). I kind of hoped they would tell me more about the food 
but no go. I also kept hoping her son would participate in the 
conversation more and several times she turned to him for 
translation help. 
Using the furniture as a base I asked 
if 
anyone 
in the 
local 
Korean community made it. I had asked the same question of 
Kimberly: did people around there still embroider, carve, etc. 
Each time the answer was no. 
If people want Korean artifacts they 
order them through stores and via friends visiting Korea. 
I can't quite tell what will 
be the result of probing this 
particular community. Kimberly says most of the Koreans in the 
area are either the wives of servicemen or wives of retired 
servicemen. Evidently, older people make up a significant portion 
of the community. How do they fit in? How do their neighbors 
Samuelson--83 Fieldnotes 
page 23 
perceive them? They don't appear to really live close to each 
other so how do the stores and the church function as unifying 
devices? 
Do the Koreans have a sense of place in regards to the 
Pines? Why to the retired ones choose to settle here?

TX01: Elaine Thatcher and I went to the Hammonton area to visit 
the Putiris. First we encountered Sal Putiri Sr. at the market 
(Emma's Farm Market)G—Elwood; 12GT. While waiting for Ralph Putiri 
and Floyd Bird at the Putiri's house, Sal showed us some paper 
and pen games and puzzles that he had learned as a kid. He also 
mentioned that once he had seen the footprints of the Jersey 
Devil. This was when he was little. Said 
they looked like goat 
hooves. 
While waiting for Ralph and Floyd I noticed several things 
about the house. There was a miniature farm market on a knick— 
knack shelf. Elaine later photographed it. There was also a a 
plaster head of Jesus in one corner of the kitchen, on top of 
some cupboards, very inobtrusive. 
They closed up the stand. I was amazed that all 
this meant 
was turning off the lights. No gates or storing the baskets. They 
seemed quite blase about it. 
If someone wanted a basket of 
apples, no big deal. As Elaine pointed out, 
if any large scale 
theft occurred, they would probably hear it. They did have a gun 
in the house which they indicated they would not hesitate to use. 
TX02: Ralph, Elaine and I went to a restaurant south of 
G—Hammonton; 11GT, past the Atlantic City Expressway on Rt. 54, 
called Toni's Custard. This was a small restaurant serving 
burgers, hoagies, soft ice cream and the like. But on Wednesday 
nights a group of Italian ladies, all 
related it seems to the 
owner, Mrs. Toni Marinella, get together and make spaghetti. The 
pasta is home made, as 
is the sauce (although sometimes they use 
a tomato puree ready—made). They make meatballs the "good" way, 
frying them (the night before) rather than baking them. The 
spaghetti comes with either meatballs or Italian sausage which 
is 
purchased locally. I had the sausage and 
it was terrific! The 
meals also came with salad and bread. 
Toni's Custard is a seasonal place, open from April to 
September. It gets a lot of tourist trade but the Wednesday 
"Italian nights" also attract locals. 
On a good night they may 
Samuelson--83 Fieldnotes 
page 25 
serve 70 people from 5 to 8 P.M. 
When we walked in several of the ladies who were responsible 
for the spaghetti were sitting around a table. The one who kept 
being referred to as the one 
in charge, Mrs. DiMeglio (Toni's 
mother), disappeared early in the game and 
we never got to talk 
to her. I struck up a conversation with Toni's mother—in—law, 
Mrs. Marinella. She prefers to make baked goods rather than 
pastas and will trade with the other ladies to get the things she 
doesn't make. She referred to one 
lady who makes pastas and sells 
them out of her house but I didn't catch the name. She talked 
about what she'll do after the restaurant closes--visit her 
children and grandchildren. She said she likes to keep busy and 
keep a good outlook on 
life. 
Taking Mrs. Marinella's place was Clara Paolino, Toni's 
aunt. She seemed the most gregarious of the lot and 
is really 
enthusiastic about canning and cooking. I will try to visit her 
canning house and kitchen. She was amiable to having us visit her 
in the future and gave us her phone number: 561-3447. She makes 
pickled sweet peppers, eggplant, celery, carrots, tomatoes. 
Jersey tomatoes make a really good sauce. She likes to make 
stuffed eggplant, using the eggplant as a little boat to hold the 
stuffing. 
She also makes jelly and cranberry sauce, also a wild 
cherry brandy using vodka as the base. She doesn't like to drink 
it, just make it. She has also tried another fermented cranberry 
drink and liked 
it but decided it was too much trouble. 
Another speciality is blueberry buckle with a crumbly topping 
made with brown sugar and butter. I think this was what I had at 
the roast beef supper last Saturday. Clara claims her cooking is 
easy, not hard. She has a big freezer to accommodate the results. 
Lots of things she gives to her kids. 
She doesn't want to 
lose 
the tradition. If you stop making things, you forget how to. Some 
of her nieces follow in the tradition, especially in regards to 
making pickles. 
During the meal, the conversation started to focus on red 
peppers. Toni's brought out a bowl 
of them and Floyd and Ralph 
egged me on to make a pepper sandwich when I said I had never 
eaten one. 
It was pretty good. 
Is a big thing 
in the Italian 
community. The peppers were fried, cooled and had some oil 
and 
possibly vinegar on them. 
There were several comments about the Pinelands Commission. 
Clara said you needed more then 3 acres in order to build a house 
so she and her husband had to give some of their land to their 
son. 
It was land they used to rent and now the loss of that 
income has .screwed up their taxes. They live, I think, 
in 
something of a family compound on White Horse Pike. Someone 
mentioned there being asparagus fields nearby. 
After dinner Ralph directed us out the Pike to these homes. 
We also took a brief foray onto the old White Horse Pike and he 
Samuelson--83 Fieldnotes 
page 26 
showed us a building that had once been a stage coach stop on the 
old run from Philadelphia to Tuckerton. Along the way he pointed 
out Bremi's Pizzeria in Hammonton as a really good place. 
Earlier, he had recommended the Columbia II 
diner, where his 
Gideons group had met the night before. 
Ralph talked about the July 16th parade for the Our Lady of 
Mt. Carmel Society. The streets are thronged and money is pinned 
to the statues carried through the town. He thinks this 
is 
sacreligious and pagan. G—Hammonton: 11GT The money goes to the 
Camden Diocese. 
Ralph also mentioned St. Mary's Cemetery, the oldest 
Catholic cemetery in New Jersey. It 
is on Pleasant Mills Rd., 
about a mile from the Batsto—Pleasant Mills Cemetery on the river 
side. He claims Catholic tombstones are different from others. 
TX03: We returned to the Putiri house and spent some time 
interviewing on tape Sal Sr. 
(see tape log). He 
is a town 
committeeman for Mullica and a former mayor. He told us about his 
life, about living 
in the area. Gave some good insights on 
farmers and farming (i.e., differences between what different 
ethnic groups grow), gathering stuff in the woods (moss, 
teaberry, mushrooms). He offered to 
introduce us to the rabbi of 
the Black community in Elwood and also take us for a walk 
in the 
woods and show us things. Throughout the interview Ralph was 
sorting old family photographs and showed us selected ones. 
G—Mullica: 12GT 
Mrs. Putiri died last spring and I get the feeling she 
is 
sorely missed. I feel 
like these men sort of rattle around in the 
house. They have a housekeeper who had made a cranberry nut cake. 
(We took a piece home, along with a half gallon of cider that 
they gave us.) There used to be another housekeeper, a Black 
woman named Ethel. She practically raised Ralph and Sal 
Jr. Lived 
in Florida with her husband 
in the winter and then they name 
north 
in April. 
I felt that the evening was very productive. Sal Sr. 
is 
quite a guy. Knows a lot of people, seemed very happy to talk to 
us. Hopefully we can take him up on his offer of a walk in the 
woods (maybe with Eugene Hunn?). Ralph 
is interesting too. He 
followed in his father's footsteps by running for office but 
lost. The Italian ladies, especially Mrs. Paolino, will also be 
great for in—depth foodways stuff. It 
is very intriguing to see 
the ways the different stations along the food network interlock: 
the farmers (we need to visit some), market owners or 
distributors, home cooks (those who make it just for themselves 
and those who may sell some), and commercial cooks (bakers, 
sausage makers), not to mention restaurants. It all fits 
together, that's for sure.

TXO1:I had two major interviews today. The first was with Lt. 
Col. Craig C. MacNab, the Public Affairs Officer at G—Ft. Dix; 19GT 
He 
is an excellent man to have 
in this position. He has steeped 
himself 
in the history of the area and seems genuinely concerned 
about what goes on 
in communities such as Wrightstown, Browns 
Mills, and 
Pemberton. He 
is familiar with much of south Jersey, 
from the Philadelphia suburbs, to the shore, Cape May, the 
Pinelands, etc. 
One of the things MacNab stressed is the public's perception 
of army people as only being around for a short time and thus not 
caring about where they live. The standard tour of duty 
is now 2-
4 years and the army people really do want to make friends and 
see that the place where they live 
is a good one. The base as a 
whole has been here for 66 years and the higher staff recognize 
the need to demonstrate commitment to the area. 
Schools, Scout troops, hunters, etc. can all 
use Ft. Dix's 
facilities. Priority goes to people based here and to veterans 
and army retirees, but most locals' 
requests can be accommodated, 
although MacNab says he has to be careful that the base doesn't 
turn into a "low—cost convention center." 
I asked him about the Korean population in Browns Mills and 
the army's contribution in terms of servicemen's wives. He 
is 
quite aware of the Korean concentration but also indicated that 
there were a lot of Germans in the area because many Army men 
have married German women during their postings abroad. But 
because the visual and cultural differences are not so dramatic 
the German influence 
is 
less noticeable and hasn't really be taken 
into consideration. 
The base, along with Maguire Air Force Base and Lakehurst 
Naval Air Station, are located along the northern edge of the 
Pinelands National Reserve. They have had to work with the 
Pinelands Commission to develop management plans and the 
relationship appears to be an amiable one. The base contributes a 
great deal 
to the diversity of the nearby communities and could 
Samuelson--83 Fieldnotes 
page 28 
bea good resource for future contacts among the local ethnic 
groups such as the Koreans. Also, the recreational and natural 
resources uses of the base--hunting, fishing, woodcutting, 
camping, hiking--could be explored in greater depth. 
TX02: In the afternoon I went to see Earl Piper, a blueberry and 
cranberry farmer who lives on G—Magnolia Road: 21GT. Phone 
is 894-
2026. He also works as a code inspector at the Pemberton Township 
offices: 894-8201. The latter is the best place to reach him as 
he wanted to work with me on township time. He spent a lot of 
time telling me about cranberry and blueberry growing. He owns 
various plots of ground in the Magnolia Rd. area. Right now he 
is 
dry harvesting cranberries and many lugs of them were sitting in 
his shed. They still had a lot of chaff and would have to be 
separated. The dry harvested berries are sold locally or packaged 
for fresh sales while wet harvested ones have to be canned for 
sauce. Earl doesn't do the harvesting himself but hires some 
local people. 
He drove me around the Magnolia Rd. area and also into 
Southampton Township, the area around Buddtown and Stockton 
Bridge Rd. There were lots of cranberry bogs and woods. 
Intermixture of houses--some very old, some suburbanish, some 
rather shabby. He was very keen on pointing out places where he 
had seen deer. Sometimes he and his son go to "spotlight" them. 
They just shine their lights on the deer rather than try to shoot 
them, although he 
is 
an avid hunter. 
Earl counted 12 houses near his house/farm area that 
belonged to members of his family. He showed me one (belonging to 
his nephew?) where they grow azaleas and rhododendrons. Everyone 
seems to work at several jobs 
in order to keep money coming in. 
None of the houses looked run down so the family must do well. 
I also met Wilbur Bush, a blueberry and Christmas tree 
grower who also raises turkeys. He lives on Magnolia Rd., I 
think. There are lots of Bushs in the area. We toured his 
blueberry packing shed. He would be a good person to go back and 
see, 
is part of a prominent grower family that originally from 
French Canada. Another introduction was to Mr. E. W. Bowker. He 
used to have a cannery on Stockton Bridge Rd. that burned almost 
2 years ago. There were cranberry seedlings in front of his 
office building on Magnolia Rd. 
It was great riding around with Mr. Piper. He may be a good 
person to go back to visit some more, especially for information 
about hunting. Maybe I should also arrange for some photographing 
of a dry cranberry harvest. He gave me a name too for a guy 
in 
Mt. Holly who acts as a broker for people who collect moss, 
birch, pinecones, etc. More information on this 
is 
in my tape

TX01: Two major events today, a pig roast and a turkey supper. By 
the end of 
+.he day I had eaten clams, venison, pork and turkey. 
The pig roast was sponsored by the Veterans of Foreign Wars 
(VFW) Post #6805 on G—Mt. Misery Road; 21GT between New Lisbon and 
Browns Mills, 894-8881. The contact I had there was Dino Dimiano 
whose idea 
it was to have the pig roast. The VFW also has surf 
and turf dinners (steak and seafood), picnics, barbeques, and 
lets senior citizens use the place for events too. 
The pig was roasting outdoors on a spit. The fire was mostly 
out as the pig had been cooking since 9:00 P.M. 
last night. It 
was finished 
at about 6:00 
A.M, and was just being kept warm. A 
Filipino man, Nino (?), had been 
in charge of the cooking. 
Whenever any group in the area does a pig roast he 
is the man to 
call. He hangs out at Joe's Tavern 
in Browns Mills and I was told 
he works for the government, which may mean Ft. Dix. He had just 
left to get cleaned up and several hours later, just as Christine 
and I were leaving, he came 
in, dressed very nicely, and was 
sitting at the bar. We complimented him on the pig and maybe can 
reach him through the VFW people for an interview. 
The pig was a whole pig. Accompanying it were salad, corn, 
beer, chicken, hot dogs, clams and venison. For $10 one could eat 
and drink all 
s/he wanted, plus there was a bar inside the VFW 
building. Everything except the clams and venison stew were 
cooked and served outdoors; the clams and venison were 
in the 
kitchen. The weather was bad--rainy--so people got their food 
outdoors and then brought it 
inside. 
Christine and I fell 
in with a crowd who proudly proclaimed 
their Pineyness and seemed to have the credentials to back 
it up. 
One guy, Hazy (short for Hazelton), had been up all night tending 
to the pig and was very sloshed. He comes from a family near 
Chatsworth (possibly the Dukes) where 22 adults live together. 
They live off the woods--cutting, gathering, hunting. They also 
go out to the shore and at night steal clams from other people's 
lots. 
They can make $40 or $50 a night that way. 
In addition to 
Samuelson--83 Fieldnotes 
page 30 
problems caused by his drunkenness, Hazy may have a speech 
impediment that made 
it rather hard to understand him at times. 
He got teased several times by some of the people at another 
table whom Christine was interviewing but evidently Hazy can hold 
his own and is a man to be reckoned with 
if 
he 
is crossed. 
One of Hazy's buddies is a guy named Turtle Simcox. He was a 
part of this Chatsworth crowd and has a sister (married) that 
Hazy admired because she was a good mechanic. This brings up the 
whole issue of the behavior of 
these men (Hazy and his buddies) 
toward women. One guy, a coal miner who had worked in Scranton 
but was from the area originally, was really intense in putting 
his arm around me and had to be pried away from me by one of the 
older VFW men. 
We seemed to encounter two kinds of groups--these Piney guys 
who were welcomed but not central to the main event of the pig 
roast --and the older VFW men. Now, some of them were pretty 
sloshed too but there was more of an air of respectability among 
the older group. These included Dino, a guy named Smitty (who was 
a highly decorated Vietnam vet; his wife was 
in charge of the 
kitchen), and Arthur Gordon, who seemed the most sober of the 
lot. 
It will be people like them that I will go back to to find 
out more about the pig roast, the other events they produce 
(parades, patriotism groups for boys and girls), the role of the 
VFW in a community with a visible military presence (Ft. Dix). 
Smitty was up to posing for me with the head of the pig 
which had been hacked off and placed on a post. The mayor of 
Pemberton, Mr. Albino, also happened by (He's a member of the 
post.) and posed with the pig's head too. There were some kids 
playing 
in the sand nearby and I took some pictures of them and 
asked them about playing in the woods (they do) and building 
forts (yes). 
Kind of an anomalous guy was Levi Scull (possible address: 
203 Seminole Tr., Country Lakes, 893-3433). He was this old guy 
sitting over near the pig after it had been removed from the 
spit. He 
is 84 years old, wears his gray hair in a small ponytail 
(for which he was teased by Hazy and his cronies), 
is 
rather 
arthritic but very spirited. He was born 
in Pasadena and spent 
much of his life as a woodcutter. Used to sell wood for 50 cents 
a cord in Gloucester City. He also had acquired some land and had 
given or sold for a low price the land that the VFW had built 
their post on. He was quite a character and was proud of being a 
Piney. 
Back 
in the post building Christine was interviewing these 
younger Pineys about their lifestyles. I recorded a little bit on 
the Nagra but then a country band started playing and that 
drowned out most of the conversation. I had a chance to scope out 
the rest of the participants. Most were in their 40s or older. 
Lots of couples. Some danced to the band. A few blacks came 
in 
Samuelson--83 Fieldnotes 
page 31 
towards the end. The event started at noon. We left around three 
and 
it was still going strong. 
I felt vaguely uncomfortable around these "real" Pineys. 
Their attitude towards women was very familiar and sexist. 
Christine probably has more to say about it 
in her notes. I 
shrugged off the jokes and come—ons as much as I could. Hazy 
apologized several times for his behavior but a few minutes later 
was back at it. There were times when he was making an obvious 
attempt to be a gentleman, like getting me a beer or using his 
ticket to get us some clams and venison. I couldn't help but 
think, here I am this Ph.D. and this guy probably is 
illiterate 
(Christine later told me they had admitted as much.) and what 
would he think 
if 
he knew the whole story. We tried several times 
to explain who we were and what we were doing but nothing really 
seemed to register with the younger crowd. 
I think people like Dino and Smitty were a bridge between 
this younger group and the more sedate, older post members. The 
young people were there for a good party and to drink; the older 
crowd to help raise money, chat, eat, dance, 
listen to the band. 
Hopefully interviews will flesh this out some more. It was a very 
high energy event and one with a sort of earthiness to 
it too. 
TX02: 
In contrast, the Turkey Supper sponsored by the Germania 
Volunteer Fire Company on G—Cologne Avenue; 09GT, just a mile or so 
north of Rt. 30, was less intense but it had a certain vibrancy 
of 
its own. In contrast to the Roast Beef Supper last week 
in 
Lower Bank, there were more families, more kids, more teens. The 
firehouse was larger and fancier. There was even a oriental—style 
rug on the floor of the garage and a antiqueish fire truck parked 
there with an plastic inflatable dalmatian in the seat. 
There was a long line of people waiting for supper. By the 
time we 
left, over 1150 people had been served. There was a large 
room upstairs with vinyl tablecloths over the long tables and a 
kitchen well staffed with the firemen's wives. Waiting in 
line 
is 
really a part of the event and there were several standard 
comments from people who were leaving, such as "It's worth the 
wait" or "We saved you some food." People would wave at and greet 
others, kids would run around, some people would sit 
in chairs 
around the edge of the waiting area. 
"Chances" were being sold for 50 cents for various raffle 
items. There were also posters advertising other events sponsored 
by fire companies, the American Legion and the like. There was a 
bar downstairs dispensing beer and lots of men walking around in 
aprons (they were also directing the traffic). 
As we got to the front of the line we had the chance to talk 
to several fire company members. The company has 45 men and they 
sponsor a supper on the first Ist Saturday of October and May. 
Turkey and pork are both offered. 
46 turkeys were purchased, 
Samuelson--83 Fieldnotes 
page 32 
about 1200 lbs., plus some extra breast meat. The wives do the 
cooking but the men were up at 4:30 this morning to cut up the 
birds and will not finish working until 
11 P.M. One of them 
remembered that over 35 years ago there would be chicken dinners 
for 50 cents. Said that if we wanted to come back and do 
interviews to do so on Mondays, that's cleaning night. 
Once we got upstairs we saw the teenage girls working as 
waitresses. They may or may not be related to the guys 
in the 
company or their wives. Some may be just high school kids. There 
was a plague on the wall with the names of past firemen. Almost 
all 
of the names were German but when we had asked about Germanic 
organizations in the area no one knew of any current ones. 
The food was quite good. The menu included white and dark 
turkey meat, canned peas, mashed potatoes and gravy, sweet 
potatoes, coleslaw, celery, rolls and butter, cranberry sauce, 
coffee/tea„ soda (25 cents extra for RC, 7—Up, orange), and cake 
(no choice, take what they give you). 
We chatted with several senior citizen types. One guy works 
at the local high school but comes from Lower Bank and considers 
himself a Piney. His wife says that when a group of his relatives 
gets together they talk "River Talk," a kind of accent that she 
can't understand. She also knew someone in Chatsworth that had 
been talking to Christine. By the time we finish we probably 
won't need to introduce the project anymore because everyone will 
have run 
into us or know someone who has. It's kind of neat to 
think about how thoroughly we are doing our work. 
Elaine found out as we were leaving that they had bought 4 
more turkeys to feed a larger than expected crowd. While last 
week's supper was crowded, this seemed a more jovial crowd, 
people tended to linger a bit more. 
It perhaps was more affluent 
too. Hard to tell. 
The men had the most visible positions--parking cars, 
selling tickets, seating people. The women did the more menial 
things--cooking, serving, waiting tables, although the men paid 
their dues 
in the kitchen too. I liked this supper a lot, felt 
comfortable and happy among the people. There was less of a 
rushed atmosphere.

TXO1: 
Went back to G-Egg Harbor City; 05GT to document the Harvest 
Home celebration at St. John's United Church of Christ. Elaine 
and I were there last week for the church's Apple Festival and 
heard about the service. I thought it would be an interesting 
event to document and 
Jens accompanied me this time. Carl was 
glad we were doing a white middle-of-the-road kind of church as 
they often get ignored 
in favor of the more flamboyant black or 
fundamentalist congregations. 
We arrived at 10:00 A.M., an hour before the service 
started, 
in order to set up the equipment. We set up five mikes: 
congregation, pulpit, announcements stand and two for the choir. 
I took pictures from the back of the church and Jens from the 
front. The people were very accommodating, especially Mrs. Ruof, 
the minister's wife. She struck me as being very much what I 
expected a minister's wife to be--very kind, helpful, cheerful, 
chatty. Has a daughter who is 
interested 
in folklore. She and her 
husband are originally from Lancaster in Pennsylvania. Have been 
at this church for 2 years but he has been a minister for 23 
years. The congregation numbers about 150. 
At the front of the church was a large table laden with 
vegetables (tomatoes, peppers, eggplant, bread, carrots), baked 
and canned goods such as jam. There was also a hand embroidered 
banner with the word "First Fruits" and a picture of some fruits 
hanging from above. At the base of the communion table was a 
pumpkin, some Indian corn and squash. By the announcements 
lecturn where s.ome beautiful potted mums. 
The service started rather casually as the reverend walked 
in 
an said good morning and the congregation answered with 
enthusiastic good mornings. Then he asked everyone to greet the 
people around them. I had never seen this kind of direct contact 
between a minister and the congregation at the start of a service 
but thought it was very nine and personal. I felt involved 
in the 
service right away rather than being simply an onlooker. 
Rev. Ruof announced Jens's and my presence and explained 
Samuelson--83 Fieldnotes 
page 34 
what we were doing. The first part of the service was oriented 
around the Harvest Home theme. (See program in ephemera file.) 
There was a hymn, "We Praise Thee, 0 God," followed by a 
congregational prayer said in unison: 
Father in Heaven, we praise you for every good gift of the 
natural world; for water and sunlight and the good earth, for the 
harvest of the fields and orchards and seas. Deliver us, Father, 
from the power of evil, that we may produce a harvest of good 
deeds. Help us to show kindness, to serve one another and 
especially to share with those 
in need. Keep us always in your 
care and gather us at last into your everlasting kingdom, through 
Christ who clearly showed us your loving purpose. Amen." 
Pastor: Let us do good and remember that God alone 
is the 
source of goodness. "For every good thing bestowed and every 
perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of 
Lights." 
Congregation: And 
it was by his will and through His "word 
of truth...that we might be...first fruits among His creatures." 
(From James I:16-18 NASV) 
Then there was a song from a hymnal Scripture in Song, 
followed by a choir piece, "When I Needed a Neighbor." (The choir 
is composed of six or seven women; 
it was mentioned that they 
needed members.) This signified the shift into the other major 
theme of the service, the offering for the Neighbors in Need 
Program. A member of the congregation read the "lessons," 
scriptural passages from Amos 6:1, 4-7 and Luke 16: 19-31. Then a 
hymn, "Gloria Patri," was sung. This was not in 
the hymnal but 
everyone knew the words so 
it may be something sung every week. 
Next was the sermon, also called the meditation, which was 
on a parable from the Old Testament about Abraham and Lazarus. 
Next coming the offering, the doxology, prayer of dedication, and 
another hymn, "Bread of the World, 
in Mercy Broken." Communion 
was served, concluded by a prayer of Thanksgiving. The next hymn 
was "Now We Thank All Our God," followed by the benediction. Then 
the pastor and his wife (in a choir robe although I don't think 
she sang 
in the choir) walked down the aisle to the rear of the 
church. They didn't stand out on the step and talk to people as 
they left but mingled with the congregation, first in the 
vestibule area and then throughout the church. 
As we were packing up the equipment I chatted with several 
of the women I met the week before. Got some leads on 4—H 
activities. The people were very nice and although we repeatedly 
apologized for our intrusion into their services they seemed 
rather happy we were there, even thought it was because God 
wanted us there. 
The reverend showed me around the church a little bit more, 
Samuelson--83 Fieldnotes 
page 35 
pointing out an area in the rear where a crafts table was usually 
set up. At the front, where the vegetables, etc. were, people 
were choosing the items they wanted and leaving money in their 
stead. The items had been contributed by the members of the 
congregation. 
TX02: As we were wrapping things up, Mrs. Zimmer, one of the 
ladies I met last week, 
invited Jens and I over to her house for 
a meal and we accepted. She and her husband, George, 
live a few 
miles away, off of route 561, on five acres of land that runs 
down from their road, G—Heidelburg Avenue; 12GT, to a cedar swamp 
They have a charming house that they built themselves, starting 
with a very small section where the kitchen now 
is and then 
adding bedrooms and living room so 
it's all 
very longitudinal, 
in 
a straight line. Jens and I perused the paper and one of Mr. 
Zimmer's hunting magazines while lunch was being prepared. Also 
chatted with Mr. Zimmer about hunting--he shoots deer, rabbits, 
quail, an occasional fox or duck. Doesn't do 
it as much now as he 
used to. Belongs to the Germania Club, a rod and gun club. Most 
of the members are locals. 
Lunch was an good old Sunday afternoon dinner: roast 
chicken, stuffing, potatoes and carrots, coleslaw, hot red 
cabbage, chow—chow, beets, homemade cranberry sauce, gravy, 
ice 
tea. Dessert was home canned peaches and store—bought ginger 
cookies. Mrs. Zimmer said that almost every day she has something 
home—baked as a dessert but hadn't any this particular day. That 
was fine by us because the peaches were plenty after the big 
dinner. 
They told us a little about their family backgrounds. Have 
German roots, settlement in this area via New York City. As with 
the Putiris there was some stress on big families who had to 
struggle to make it. The Zimmers still feel that they don't have 
much (taxes take a lot) but are proud of their land and house. 
(The land came from her family's farm.) 
They took us on a tour of the immediate yard area. There 
were bird feeders and suet tied in a tree attracting lots of 
birds--titmice, bluejays, chickadees, woodpeckers. Some chickens 
were kept in two pens. There was a small building which serves as 
Mrs. Zimmer's workshop; she makes wreaths and other arrangements 
of dried flowers. They also showed us some chestnuts in various 
stages--covered by their prickly outer layer, partially split 
open by squirrels, and the nut meat. Next was the garden and 
various trees: crabapple, quince, yellow crabapple. 
We really need to go back and interview the Zimmers in more 
depth for local history, foodways (Mrs. Zimmer cans a lot!), 
hunting, ethnobotany, landscape features. I'd like to see that 
cedar swamp. Joseph should be enlisted to take pictures. I could 
spend days with them.

page 36 
I enjoyed the service and dinner. Felt like I was really 
being included in the community. Although I probably won't get 
back to the church I felt like a place would be made for me 
there. It's not just a case of being recognized and welcomed as a 
stranger doing weird things like taping a church service. I felt 
a keen sense of 
interest on the part of the people we talked to. 
Again, the ladies seemed more sociable, as I noted earlier in my 
notes on the apple festival. Yet the men would say hello and one 
person, Mr. Vetter, I believe, sat next to me during the service 
and guided me through tricky parts, 
like the offering, the hymns 
and communion. 
The Zimmers seemed to enjoy our company too and were quite 
at ease. The situation may be different once we truck 
in tape 
recorders and cameras and the like so I was glad to have this 
more relaxed opportunity to observe the scene. They are good, 
kind, gentle people, enjoy their house, their yard, their life. 
They are not woodsy types 
in the stereotypical Piney sense, are a 
bit more "civilized" than than roustabouts Christine and 
encountered yesterday, but still express a highly developed 
awareness of the land and space around them.

TX01: Went to the Southampton Municipal Building in G—Vincentown; 
23GT to 
interview Mayor Bob Thompson. Most of the information he 
gave me 
is on the tape (PFP83—ASS004). Southampton is mainly 
agricultural with some forested areas at the southeastern edge. 
There are a lot of sod farms, a few dairy farms, some 
cranberrying. No real ethnic enclaves or concentrations of Blacks 
or Hispanics. He pointed out the location of two farms formerly 
owned by two Frenchmen (who died without descendants) and a 
Polish farmer's area (entered on map). He said the area was 
really "Americanized." The grange still serves as a focal point 
for community activities. 
Thompson is a part of the Thompson family. He's Brad 
Thompson's uncle. He seemed like a nice enough guy, a bit of the 
local politico about him. 
In driving through parts of Southampton on Rt. 206 and on New 
Road the impression I get is of really beautiful countryside and 
some settled areas with suburban—ish houses with lots of trees 
around. There are plenty of big trucks roaring up and down Rt. 
206 which are 
in sharp contrast to the bucolic farmscapes one 
sees alongside the road. As far as transition areas go, 
Southampton is much closer to the suburban scale, rather than 
exurbia or ruburbia (Time's term for areas out in the country 
which serve as residences for commuters to the city but which are 
not densely populated enough to really be suburbs.)

The purpose of this day's notes 
is to record some 
information given to me by Lucy Long on Korean foodways. Lucy is 
a grad student at the Univ. of Pennsylvania and 
is a specialist 
in Korean ethnomusicology. Since there is a possibility of doing 
some work 
in the Korean community in G—Browns Mills; 21GT she 
provided some ideas on things to 
look for. 
The national dish of Korea is kim chee (chi). Sometimes this 
refers to a particular type, usually winter or cabbage kim chee. 
It 
is a basic, pickled cabbage. There are other varieties, 
depending on the season and what vegetables are available. 
In Korea there is a week—long fall festival devoted to making kim 
chee. 
It 
is packed in huge jars, put in the ground for 1-3 months 
while 
it ferments. It will 
last all winter out in the cold. 
In 
the U.S. 
it 
is made 
in quantities of a gallon or two because the 
big jars aren't available. It may sit around for days or weeks 
rather than months which curtails the fermentation process. 
Kim chee has a very strong smell when 
it has fermented. It 
contains garlic, fish, hot peppers. It stays on the breath and 
Korean—Americans tend not to eat it 
if they know they are going 
to be meeting Americans afterwards. 
In terms of other foods, Lucy describes Korean cooking as an 
earthier version of Chinese foods. It's more solid, "you don't 
get hungry 3 hours later." It also tends to be spicy. 
Drinks include tea and a rice wine called makaly (makali). 
The same dishes are served at breakfast, 
lunch and dinner. There 
is 
rice for each individual. Breakfast is fish, often stir—fried 
or fermented, seaweed, kim chee. Lots of 
little side dishes, as 
many as you can afford. Lunch 
is 
rice and kim chee or perhaps 
soup and noodles. Dinner is the same as breakfast, often with the 
addition of a main dish. 
Another specialty is pulgogi, meaning fire meat, which is often 
broiled or fried at the table. 
It 
is marinated in brown sugar, 
soy sauce and garlic. It 
is a national dish like kim chee. 
Mondu 
is another specialty; 
it 
is available at the International Cafe 
in Browns Mills. 
Samuelson--83 Fieldnotes 
page 39 
Chop chae 
is a Chinese—influenced dish made with rice vermicelli 
and vegetables and meat. 
It 
is usually served cold with a clear, 
corn starchy sauce. 
Dessert is fruit, sometimes a kind of donut with a bean paste, 
and regular American—style desserts. 
Korean musical tastes are interesting. Status 
in Korean society 
is acquired through the appreciation of western classical music. 
The Koreans are very pro—American. Presbyterian influence--
schools and hospitals. Many church—centered organizations in the 
community. People go to church but may not be believers but they 
are very serious at the same time about their attendance. This 
would be 
interesting to explore further in the Browns Mills 
Korean Baptist Church milieu.

Joseph and I began a day of festivals by going to the 
Medford Apple Festival at G-Kirby's Mill; 18GT. Christine had 
previously interviewed one of the organizers about the history 
and orientation of the event so we just went to observe and 
photograph. It was crowded, as Christine had warned us lover 
10,000 people would attend). 
I checked out some of the booths lining the approach to the 
old mill but made my first intensive observations inside the 
mill. It 
is 
in the process of being restored and various mill and 
farm implements were lying around, some labelled. There were lots 
of vendors too. The first one I approached was a 30ish woman 
named Linda Hamilton who was selling quilts and applehead dolls. 
She belongs to a quilting group in Medford that 
includes people 
who teach other how to quilt and thus might be very interesting 
to document further. Linda laughed about her doll-making, saying 
people expect her to 
look like the dolls she makes. This is an 
interesting concept, how younger tradition bearers themselves 
deal with the stereotype of craftspeople or folk artists as 
having to be old. I have to admit myself that I approach a 
younger artist with some skepticism, justified in some cases when 
people admit they use magazines or take classes as a part of 
developing their skill. Linda's phone number is 963-7667; her 
apple doll business is called Apple Dames 'N Dudes. 
The next stand I looked at was a potpourri stand sponsored 
by Dobbs Flowers. Shirley Dobbs is the owner: 654-8952. She was 
very busy so I didn't get to talk to her and thus don't know 
where she lives or how local 
her business is. There were many 
potpourri stands around and I suspect the owners purchase their 
supplies elsewhere, out of the area, and maybe throw in some 
local materials, e.g., dried flowers, when they can 
An example of a less traditionally-oriented artisan was the 
Medford Sampler table. The proprietors are J.A. and D.T. 
Cornelius, address is: 
51 N. Main St. Medford, NJ 08055. Phone: 
654-5627. I think it 
is a mother and daughter operation and I 
spoke with the mother. The daughter stencils designs onto fabric 
Samuelson--83 Fieldnotes 
page 41 
and the mother does the embroidery. The daughter gets ideas from 
magazines and such but also appears to draw on her own concepts, 
such as choosing a decoy figure because she wanted to have some 
"masculine" items available. After the needlework is done the 
samplers are mounted as pillows, hangings, etc. This is an 
obvious folklorismus activity but might be worthy of 
investigation as to the acquisition of 
interest and skill 
in the 
needlework process. 
Did mother teach daughter and then daughter 
search outside of the traditional realm for ideas necessary to 
run a business? 
Cornucopia Enterprizes was a bit more evenly balanced 
between "popular" and "traditional." (What do I mean by that, for 
heavens sake?!) They buy spices from a wholesaler, then package 
them but they also grow herbs and sell them fresh and dried 
(price list and order form is 
in my ephemera file.) They had 
things like catnip and herbal moth preventatives for sale. I 
talked with the owners briefly, Marci and Ed Drechsel, and 
it 
seems like Mrs. Drechsel 
is the more agriculturally—oriented. 
They live at: Box 67-2, RD 2, Wrightstown, NJ 08562; phone: 758-
2009. They also do 
landscape design and so may be very 
interesting to talk to about their conceptions of 
land use 
in the 
area. I don't think they were brought up around here though. 
The apple theme was carried out in the mill by various 
cardboard posters of apples, especially near a little booth that 
displayed photos of the restoration process. There was also a 
booth selling apple candles (votive, cylinder, apple—shaped), a 
deodorizer for the refrigerator (shaped like an apple), apple 
jelly, dried apples, and such. 
Upon exiting the mill (see map of area in my map file) I 
explored what seemed to be the area where food items were 
concentrated. There was table with elaborate Williamsburg—style 
apple centerpieces. A tented area sold hot dogs, cider, orange 
drink (in a MacDonald's plastic barrel), coffee, donuts, and 
slices of cake. Nearby was the bake—off table. 39 entries were 
recorded this year, all 
but four in the dessert category. The 
non—desserts were: Golden Chicken Normandy (the winner), an apple 
chutney, apple salad and apple kugel. Desserts included apple 
cakes, pies and tortes. 
"Jersey Jerry" had a stand selling jugs of cider and bags of 
apples. This stand is associated with Roberts Orchards, Church 
Rd., Vincentown. Behind this stand two men were stirring huge 
vats of apple butter cooked over open fires. One told me about 
the process: you take applesauce, add spices, cook over an open 
fire for 7 hours. You can do 
it on a stove (which makes a real 
mess) or 
in a slow cooker like a crockpot. Doing it over an open 
fire 
is too much trouble, especially since 
it has to be stirred 
constantly. 
Nearby was an apple press. The man running it allowed kids 
Samuelson--83 Fieldnotes 
page 42 
to throw in apples to be gro 
pressing. The resulting fres 
scouts. I bought a cup and i 
and up while he did most of the 
h apple juice was being sold by boy 
t was terrific. 
Along the wall 
of the mill were recipes mounted on red 
paper. They had been contributed by 
local schoolchildren, 
probably garnered from their mother's recipe files or cookbooks 
and mainly concentrating on apple desserts. 
Another big attraction was a blacksmith but my eye was 
caught by a broommaker. This was Dr. Sam Moyer, who uses "broom 
corn" (from sorghum). He 
is a professor who does this as a hobby. 
Christine got some information on him in her earlier interview. 
There was an 
interesting bicycle contraption used, I guess, to 
get some of the chaff off of the broom corn. Some little kids 
were trying it out. 
Next to the broommaker was a basketmaker, Debby Riddle. She 
lives 
in Medford, phone:953-0432. Most of the wood she uses for 
her baskets comes from outside the area but she does use some 
local 
items, such as grapevine or honeysuckle for accent and one 
basket was totally made with honeysuckle. She may be an 
interesting person to follow up on. 
Is sort of a back—to—nature— 
type, dressed in peasanty clothing, had several kids underfoot. 
Would be 
interesting to find out how and why she got into making 
baskets and how much (and where she goes) she utilizes the local 
woods and fields in gathering vines and such. 
Another booth had wassail for sale. There was a table for 
the Pinelands Garden Club, one of the co—sponsors of the event, 
which had lots of pine cone arrangements for sale. Other vendors 
included : caramel apples (rolled in peanuts, being sold out of a 
pick—up truck), soft toys, needlework kits, quilted bags, dried 
flower arrangements, corn husk dolls. One big apple head doll 
table was labelled "American Folk Art" and had a book about 
Bluebeard and the Pinelands on 
it. 
There were lots of quilts for 
sale, mostly 
in pillow, wreath or bag form. Also some handpainted 
Christmas ornaments and other kinds of Christmas crafts (e.g., 
needlework sewed around old Christmas cards), some paintings, 
tole painting, pine cone wreaths, spatterware, picture frames, 
wood art. An 
interesting juxtaposition of a decoy perched on top 
of a plastic Wawa milk crate. Some of the dried flower people had 
local 
items--statice, baby's breath. 
Some music--dulcimer makers and players, a dance group 
(young girls in 
red dresses) 
People come to th

kind of event to be entertained, to eat 
a variety of 
items to choose from but many 
kinds of things. There was no out and and 
lot of the kinds of artsy—crafts thing you 
like this in other places. However, talking 
like the quilter, herbalist or basketmaker, 
Samuelson--$3 Fieldnotes 
page 43 
revealed possible more traditional/local connections so an event 
like this does offer some entry into a less folkie, more 
folkloric milieu. 
Lots people appeared to know each other and greeted each 
other. The historical society and garden club emphasis helped to 
provide more local connections. Thus it was not entirely an 
impersonal affair although it was very easy for one to walk 
through the crowd and remain totally anonymous, interacting only 
in the most vague way with the rest of the people there or with 
the vendors. How far away do people come from to attend this kind 
of event? How involved do the locals get, how much do they feel 
like 
it 
is their turf that they are opening up to outsiders? 
It's definitely a family event, 
lots of kids, who may get 
the most out of 
it because they could participate in things like 
crushing apples or helping the broommaker. Some senior citizens 
were definitely in evidence too. 
TX02: The next stop was clear out on the other edge of the pines, 
at Mac-Hoeh's Marina, Great Bay Blvd. over the 1st bridge, 
G-Tuckerton; 51GT, NJ. Phone: 296-1888, 296-1017, and 296-3303. Our 
host was Charles "Butch" Hoeh (pronouced Hoe-ee). His wife's name 
is Dorothy. They were hosting a "Crab-In" to raise money for a 
scholarship fund to send local 
kids to college to study marine 
biology. 01' Butch was very keen on telling us about how his 
plans for expansion for his marina have been thwarted. He wants 
to build a deck, put in 
restrooms, dredge a lagoon, but the 
permit process is just overwhelming. Because we were from 
Washington he seemed to think we could be of some assistance. As 
we repeatedly told him, we were just observers and interested in 
how people lived and used the water resources, but I'm not sure 
how much really sunk 
in. He was pretty sloshed from drinking 
bee r. 
Part of the festivities was for people to catch crabs (in 
the lagoon) that had been previously marked and planted there. 
Not much was happening in that line, people seemed more content 
to sit around, talk, eat (foot-long hot dogs with chili, 
sauerkraut or onion gravy, clams, soda, beer). Big band music was 
playing on a rather elaborate stereo system. Most of the people 
were locals, all knew each other. 
It almost had a family reunion 
sense to 
it. The older crowd (including some elderly and 
handicapped people) clustered on one end of the deck area (see 
map 
in ephemera file), another, younger group was separated from 
it by a building. They were on the ground and eating clams and 
looking at the crabs that had been caught. Yet a few more were 
down on the marina itself, coming in or going out in boats. The 
view from the deck was tremendous--lots of marsh, 
inlets, could 
see the resort developments on Long Beach Island and as far away 
as Atlantic City. 
I was introduced or referred to several 
local people who 
Samuelson--83 Fieldnotes 
page 44 
might serve as good contacts: Lincoln Mott, the former mayor of 
Little Egg Harbor Township, Bill Colbourn, the retired chief of 
police, Michael Mathis, mayor of Tuckerton and a member of the 
local historical society, Wayne Dumont, a state senator, Paul 
Synder, the superintendent of schools. 
Hoeh has been 
in the area for 43 of his 46 years. He used to 
own a yacht—building business. He 
is retired from that and runs 
the marina. 
(His partner, the Mac 
in Mac—Hoeh, 
is 
dead.) Butch 
also runs a dredging business, Draper Dredging, 336 Bay Ave., 
Tuckerton, 08087. 
He 
is concerned about the development of the wetlands. 
Pointed out clam beds where polluted clams from northern New 
Jersey are transplanted to purify themselves. Is rather angry at 
the Ocean County Parks system because they don't do much with the 
land under their purview. He would like them to give 
it to him 
and he would keep it picked up and clean. He also commented on 
people who scuttled boats. Buy them and use them for a year, then 
don't want to pay storage fees so they ditch them. Also had 
interesting comments on fiberglass sneak—boxes, 
how they are 
better than wood ones. Can leave them out in the sun and not much 
will happen to them. Won't rot or warp. 
Butch introduced us to the manager of the marina, Dwight 
Pueschel. Told us to come back any time and talk. Mrs. Hoeh was 
quite welcoming too, told me about a Sept. flea market that takes 
place near Lake Pohacon. Lots of clam bakes in the summer. In the 
winter people travel to other places to be entertained. 
It was a good group of people. The event was very personal, 
especially in contrast to the bigness of the Apple Festival. When 
we arrived Butch commented that he had "hoped the public would 
come by." I'm not sure how much this event was publicized; Mal 
gave us the lead on 
it. 
It seemed like 
it was a very localized 
thing. They also had Crab—In T—shirts. 
TX03: The last event was Hamilton Township Family Day at 
Underhill Park 
in G—Mays Landing: 10GT. We got there a little after 
4 P.M. and although it was supposed to 
last until 9 P.M. 
it was 
pretty much over. 
It 
is sponsored by the Rotary Club and the 
township, according to the guy I talked with, Tom Boghosian, 1511 
Benson, Mays Landing, 08330. (Send him the courtesy photos.) This 
is the third and possibly last year for the event. It used to be 
held at Lenape Park where there were kiddie rides, miniature 
golf, a dime toss. Among the events this time were canoe races, a 
runathon, bikeathon, dance performance, karate demonstrations, 
bucket brigade (competition between fire companies), softball and 
tennis tournament, dip for apples. There used to be a crowning 
(with wreath of seaweed) of a harbormaster (didn't do that this 
time because not near water). Food included kielbasi sold by the 
Republican Club, 
funnel cake with free orange drink (again 
in 
that familiar MacDonald's container), roast beef sandwiches, 
Samuelson--83 Fieldnotes 
page 45 
pizza, hot dogs with sauerkraut, soda, Italian ice, chips, beer, 
pretzels, candy. 
There was a drill team and a variety show starting at 5 P.M. 
which we did not hang around to see. Joseph took some pictures of 
the drill team girls and the township recreation officer, Joe 
Masker, who told me how they try to 
involve all 
the kids--boys on 
football teams, girls as cheerleaders and on the drill team. No 
one 
is 
left out. He invited us to return the next day for the 
athletic association's football games and sort of homecoming 
festivities. He 
is the athletic assoc. president too 
and lives 
at 1000 Adams Ave., Mays Landing, NJ 08330. 
This event struck a nice balance between the anonymity of 
the Apple Festival and the extreme personal quality of the Crab— 
In. There were lots of kids, after all 
it was family day. People 
knew each other but the intereactions were not concentrated, 
people were off doing different things in the same general area 
and under the same rubric. Elaine and I experienced this same 
variety two weeks ago when we did the apple festival 
in Egg 
Harbor, the Renault Winery promotion, and the roast beef supper. 
Very interesting stuff here on degree of 
involvement and range of 
choices people have 
in choosing how to celebrate.

TX01: Elaine and I headed south again. She showed me the area 
around G—Sweetwater Casino; 12GT where Sal Putiri had gone with her 
last week. Then we showed up at the Putiris and shot some 
pictures and watched Sal 
Jr. paint pumpkins. 
His uses what looks like oil 
paint. There are some rooms in 
the enclosed part of Emma's Farm Market that are furnished like a 
kitchen and living room and this 
is Sal 
Jr.'s "studio." He says 
that other people around the area paint the pumpkins but he says 
the owners of the farm market's don't do 
it themselves as he 
does. He also paints all 
of the signs that line the road east of 
the market along the White Horse Pike G—Mullica: 12GT.. 
Sal 
does many different designs: Dracula, Smurfs, Fred 
Flintstone, the Incredible Hulk, Kermit the Frog, a haunted house 
scene. 
As we were leaving Ralph mentioned that he was going to make 
apple butter and some wine in the coming weeks. I asked him to 
let me know when we was going to do these things so that I could 
come and document the process. 
TX02: Elaine and I continued south to Port Elizabeth/Dorchester 
area to tape a Hymn Sing at the G—Dorchester: 38GT United Methodist 
Church. Carl met us there to help with all 
the miking and 
photographing. 
I was suprised by the event. I has always thought of 
Methodists as a rather staid bunch but this was a very talkative 
crowd, 
lots of "Praise Jesuses" and the like. The event started 
with a welcome and some singing, then a break for testimonies, 
offerings, announcements, etc., then more hymns. The music was 
very impressive and the spirit a joyous, 
lively one. 
All 
of the Methodist churches in the area (or "cluster') are 
invited to each month's sing and the congregation with the most 
people attending (except the host church) gets a plaque to keep 
in the church until the next month. The church with the most 
Samuelson--83 Fieldnotes 
page 47 
attendance over the year gets to keep the plaque at the end of 
the year. 
One of the 
local people, a woman named Ev (Elaine's notes 
should have her full name), took me on tour of the church. The 
congregation is 
127 years old and the sanctuary seemed almost 
that old. There was a newer building connected to 
it, a former 
Odd Fellows Hall that had been moved from down the street. It 
housed prayer and Sunday school rooms, a kitchen, restrooms, etc 
The sanctuary itself was quite pretty, had a nice choir loft, 
memorial stained glass windows, attractive altar area.

TX01: Elaine and went I went to visit Mrs. Clara Paolino, who 
lives on the White Horse Pike (Rt. 30), near the G—Ancora; 33GT 
turn—off. We spent a good deal 
of time talking to her about food. 
She cans a lot, gets most of her fruits and vegetables from 
family and friends who own farms or have productive gardens. The 
tape Elaine made of the conversation gives most of this 
information (see PFP83—RET016/017/018). 
Mrs. Paolino 
is a very kind lady. She seemed to enjoy 
talking to us but was somewhat overwhelmed by all 
of the 
equipment--tape recorder, camera, tripod. I wondered what was 
going through her mind as we tramped down to her cellar to take 
pictures of her jars of fruit and vegetables. They were gorgeous 
though, 
like gems. 
Part of what was going through my mind as we interviewed her 
was an almost undescribable feeling of happiness and goodness. 
The vibes she gave off were incredible. As interested as I am in 
food (as an analyst, preparer, consumer or whatever) I had never 
felt this feeling of 
intense absorption in what someone was 
saying. Food is such an 
important part of her life, a mode of 
communication, a crucial avenue through which she expresses 
herself and her sense of community, her love for her family, her 
friends, her life. I felt warm and secure and happy listening to 
her and somewhat amazed that I had never felt that way before in 
listening to anyone talk. 
Part of my reaction may have been due to the ambience. It 
was a stormy, gloomy day and the three of us were clustered 
around the table in her absolutely spotless kitchen. I could look 
out a large window to her yard and the fields and woods and sky 
beyond. It felt like such an absolutely right place to be. 
Mrs. Paolino let us sample some of her specialties--
cranberry sauce, cherry brandy, bread and butter pickles. She had 
a normal size refrigerator/freezer in the kitchen and then a very 
large freezer downstairs. The kitchen, as I said, was spotless. 
There were some canisters and a toaster oven on the counter, a 
Samuelson--83 Fieldnotes 
page 49 
few wall decorators, some butterfly magnets and pictures of 
grandchildren on the refrigerator. The table had an interesting 
basket of fake fruit that was rather striking in spite of 
it 
artificial character. I tried to take some pictures of the 
kitchen but its spartan appearance was rather deceiving. It was 
obvious she had cleaned up for 
us and she had 
laughed earlier 
about putting lipstick on. I would have rather seen the place "in 
use" with plates and foods out on the counters. (Like the way 
Mrs. Zimmer's kitchen is 
in Egg Harbor.) 
TX02: 
In the evening Elaine and I went to visit Warren and Eileen 
Homiller in G—Lower Bank; 24GT. We had met Warren several weeks ago 
at a Roast Beef Supper at the Lower Bank Firehouse where he was 
directing traffic. At this interview Elaine asked a lot of 
questions about fire companies, landscape, use of the woods 
(Eileen is quite a woodsperson.). I interjected some foodways 
questions, especially pertaining to the roast beef dinner and 
other celebratory occasions, although we did cover everyday foods 
too. Most of this information is on tapes PFP83—RET019/020/021. 
The Homillers live 
in an attractive if 
rather cramped early 
19th century farmhouse. The living room was an attractive pink 
with swag—like curtains, a fire place, pictures on the walls 
(daughter's wedding, their wedding, "ancestors"). There was also 
an organ with a rather expensive looking stereo system on top. 
The organ bench has a great covering that read "I'm proud to be a 
fireman." The coffee table had back issues of Country Living 
magazine on it. This led me to develop an impression of the 
Homillers as a somewhat creolized couple. She 
is from the area 
but he 
is from Philadelphia. They have lived 
in the city but 
decided to move back to the country and are perhaps more self— 
aware of the implications of such actions. They know they are not 
Pineys in the hardcore sense and yet are very involved 
in a 
Pinelands community. I don't know what their educational 
background is but they seem a cut above the blue collar level. 
Warren still commutes to Philly everyday. They have a friend who 
teaches dentristry at the University of Pennsylvania. All 
of 
these hints sort of add up to a slightly more upscale lifestyle 
than I had expected.

TX01: The intrepid Elaine and I headed south again today to visit 
Helen and George Zimmer on G-Heidelberg Avenue; 12GT. They live 
in 
the first house on the left as you head south from 561, 
locally 
called Duerer Road or Deer Road. I think the Duerer business 
comes from Durer, which in German has an umlaut over the "u" but 
when umlauted words are spelled in English an "e" 
is usually put 
after the letter with the umlaut, 
in this case the "u." 
The Zimmers welcomed us warmly. It was a good day to be 
indoors as the rain was just pouring down. Thus we didn't get any 
good outdoor shots but Elaine took lots of pictures of Mrs. 
Zimmer's wreaths (made from grapevines, pine cones, statice, 
etc.), her canned goods (jellies, fruits, vegetables, dandelion 
wine), her cooking (making spaetzle in split pea soup, rendering 
chicken fat, cutting up vegetables for chow-chow). These topics 
also formed the basis for much of the interview, plus stuff on 
history, place names, sexual division of 
labor, hunting, use of 
the woods and so forth. See tapes PFP83-RSS015/016/017/018/019. 
The Zimmers invited us to stay for lunch and we eagerly 
accepted. There was the aforementioned 
soup, store-bought rye 
bread, applesauce, 
lemonade, dandelion wine, crackers with 
raspberry and wild blackberry jelly. Mrs. Zimmer was concerned 
that once again she didn't have any home-baked goods--bread or 
dessert--but there certainly was plenty to eat. Afterwards she 
set me to work rutting up green and red peppers, onion, green 
tomatoes, cucumber and cauliflower for chow-chow. 
Helen and George Zimmer are basically a blue collar couple. 
He 
is 
retired from a foreman's job at Stockton State College. She 
is from a farming family that is probably land rich but lives 
simply. Lots of her relatives live up and down their street and I 
liked the sense of community that was reflected in their 
conversation and references to family interaction. Their house is 
paid for and they feel quite rooted there although they do travel 
a lot--to Delaware, around south Jersey, up to the Catskills 
where they are helping a friend build a house. They are very 
welcoming and we will were encouraged to return for a walk around 
Samuelson--83 Fieldnotes 
page 51 
their woods and to take more pictures. Elaine also wants to map 
their yard and maybe diagram their house.

When I went to get the mail today I talked to Mr. Doyle, 
the G-New Lisbon; 21GT postmaster. There had been an article about 
him in the Pemberton Community News. The article was about the 
Christmas party he has every year in the post office. He had 
mentioned this to me before so I asked him about it again. Doyle 
said he wasn't having it this year because it was too much work. 
Then he 
invited me 
into the working area of the post office and 
showed me a large, 
long divider screen that was plastered with 
newspaper clippings on the party. 
He started it back 
in the 1960s as just a small affair for 
local 
kids and their parents. There were doughnuts and coffee and 
a Santa Claus. The post office employees would also answer kids' 
letters to Santa. Doyle would dictate personal responses, often 
doing 
some research to find out what the kids really wanted. 
Over the years the party got larger and larger. Toys were 
bought to give out as prizes, more elaborate food was provided. 
Thousands of people came, often waiting in cold weather for a 
chance to greet Santa so Doyle borrowed school buses as shelters 
and eventually erected tents alongside the post office building 
so that almost an acre of ground was under cover. The framework 
for one of these enclosures is still up; Doyle would leave that 
tent up all winter and 
it would help to heat the post office. 
Stakes are still 
in the ground as support for another tent. 
Of course, 
local politicians knew this was a good public 
relations deal 
and tried to take advantage of 
it. They would be 
greeted in the post office and also allowed to read off the names 
of the prize winners. Local and regional papers and the 
Philadelphia TV stations gave the event lots of coverage. The 
last year it was held, 1981, the head of the Postal Service, 
Mr. 
Bolger, came. 
Doyle got lots of community recognition for his efforts but 
few people realized that almost everything was paid for out of 
his pocket. Occasionally people would offer assistance but rarely 
came through and those that did help out didn't like a lot of the 
Samuelson--83 Fieldnotes 
page 53 
attendees' actions, such as coming back for extra presents or 
food. Doyle was able to shrug it off but he did get tired of 
having to do 
it on his own. When he and his wife were in an 
accident in 1982 their doctors told them not to have the party. 
People were outraged. Many thought the postal service was behind 
it all and said, "How dare the Post Office stop." They couldn't 
believe it when they heard that only one man did 
it. 
I think Doyle truly enjoyed doing the party. It was a very 
generous, selfless action but in the end he too tired of all 
the 
bitching and selfishness it brought out in people. He may or may 
not have 
it this year.

Went south to find a flea market that Jens had told me 
about. Elaine and I looked for it up and down Rt. 557 between 
East Vineland and Buena but never found it but we did locate some 
interesting other things. 
On Rt. 557 in this same area we stopped at G-Bertuzzi's 
Market; 03GT, a farm market. We saw a guy 
in the fields nearby, 
picking beans. He had a fabulous vehicle. The front was a car 
body but the rear was like a flatbed truck. It was used to cart 
baskets of vegetables. It also had 4 uprights, two at each end of 
the car, which were used to support irrigation pipes during 
transport. The family has four of these trucks, 2 came from 
fam i 
1 
y cars, one from a f 
ri end's, and one from the junkyard. 
Before 1970 they simply bolted together the various sections, 
after 1970 they have been welded. 
The man picking the beans told us to go down to the market 
itself and take pictures of other cars like his that were parked 
there. I also took various shots of pumpkins and other 
vegetables, signs, flowers, etc. The proprietors didn't seem very 
interested in what we were doing. 
TX02: Since we couldn't find the flea market we stopped at a yard 
sale G-Buena Vista; 03GT along this same road. Elaine did most of 
the 
interviewing there so see PFP83-FET1015 for more information. 
Again. I took pictures. Most of the items for sale were pretty 
junky: clothes, 
ice skates, old farm tools, door knobs, Wheaton 
glassware, games, dishes. An interesting it em was a wine press 
that a family member had made. He has made wine for the past two 
years, learned how from a friend. Albert DeRosa was running the 
yard sale. He was friendly enough and talked to Elaine at some 
length; the rest of the family that was involved seemed a little 
skeptical. But because of the wine-making connection they might 
warrant a return visit or telephone contact. We promised to send 
courtesy prints. 
TX03: We drove into G-Buena; 02GT proper along Rt. 557 and Rt. 40 
Just after the intersection between 557, 40 and 54, going west, 
Samuelson---83 Fieldnotes 
page 55 
there 
is 
an interesting produce/flower stand with Halloween 
decorations. Just past it, still going west, 
is 
an old house that 
looks like 
it has some interesting yard art 
TX04: We drove into G-Hammonton; 11GT and had a late 
lunch at Joe's 
Maplewood, an Italian restaurant on Route 30 that had been 
recommended to us by several people. It lived up to 
its 
reputation. The food was delicious. 
TX05: We continued down Rt. 30, the White Horse Pike, and stopped 
at the G-White Way Market; 05GT, a produce stand/farm market near 
Egg Harbor. The reason it caught my eye was because there was a 
large replica of a chicken on top. The proprietor leases the 
stand from a man named Tony Lacktis, who lives right next door. 
He thinks the stand and the chicken (made of tin) are 40 years 
old. This was one of the first stands on the White Horse Pike. 
The current guy 
is Jeff Klotz, 550 White Horse Pike, Egg Harbor 
City, NJ 08215. This 
is his first year running it. Send courtesy 
pri nts 
The stand opens 
in March. The first crop 
is spinach and 
spring flowers. Closes in December and he goes to Florida to 
visit relatives. Klotz was rather proud of the place. Had to 
straighten up the corn stalks before I took pictures and kept 
talking to me Elaine had stayed in the car but she noted the mums 
and pumpkins placed around the roadside sign for the market, how 
baskets of apples altered with pumpkins in a rather artistic way 
on some of the shelves. 
There were a few hanging plants, a Pepsi 
machine. 
TX06: Next stop was 
in G-New Gretna; 15GT. Last week I had noted a 
scarecrow type of figure on a porch and wanted to go back and 
photograph it. 
In the meantime the porch display had become more 
elaborate. There was this figure, dressed like a farmer with 
overalls, shirt, boots, gloves, stuffed with newspaper and with a 
plastic pumpkin for a head. There was a spider web done 
in a kind 
of green florescent string; a ghost with a plastic skull head and 
draped in a sheet, suspended from the roof of the porch; and 
little plastic pumpkins hanging from the eaves. 
Harold Cramer, a 17-year old, does the decorating. We talked 
mainly to his mother and older brother. Harold was babysitting 
across the street and talked to us rather shyly just at the end 
of the visit. Everyone commented on how an elderly man who lives 
across the street enjoys the display. Harold also does them at 
Christmas and Easter. Didn't really have any model, just likes to 
decorate. Send courtesy prints to: Harold Cramer, Rt. 9, Box 12, 
New Gretna, NJ.

TX01: Elaine and I went to G—Egg Harbor City; 05GT this morning for 
a Firemen's Breakfast. It was put on by the Egg Harbor Fire 
Department which we thought was a paid fire company, especially 
since it 
is called a department rather than a company. It turns 
out that it 
is a volunteer company of about 35 men (youngest is 
21, many 
in their 20s), plus ladies auxiliary. They have 3 
breakfasts a year, 
in October, February and May. Have been having 
them for the 
last 5 years and serve about 600-700 people from 
6:30 A.M, until noon. The events are to raise money for the 
equipment fund. 
The breakfast was the most "restaurant—style" of any of 
these kinds of meals that I've attended. A man in fire captain's 
uniform was acting as kind of a maitre d'. There was a rope 
across a doorway; he took the tickets and opened it, then seated 
US. 
His name was Ray Kuehner, a retired past president and 
captain. He was 
in the company for 25 years and now has the 
option not to answer calls. He usually does if 
it 
is a building 
but not 
if 
it 
is just a trash fire. 
The person selling tickets was Barry Kienzle, 400 Havana 
Ave., Egg Harbor City, NJ 08215. Send him courtesy prints. 
Another man standing nearby gave us a booklet on the history of 
the fire co. which was printed for its 100th anniversary in 1980. 
The places at the 14 tables (each with 8 places) were set in 
a rather interesting fashion. The spoon and knife were on the 
left (spoon the furthest left) on a folded napkin, while the fork 
was on the right. We asked some people sitting at the table 
if 
this was a local custom and they said no. The place mat was from 
the U.S. Dept. of Agriculture, Forest Service made for the 
bicentennial. Across the top 
it read "America's history is 
written in her trees" and there was a cross section of tree rings 
with dates associated with significant events 
in history. 
On the table were cups and saucers, 
little plastic cups for 
orange juice, syrup bottle, sugar and sugar substitute, ketchup. 
The firemen did most of the serving and had white waiter—like 
Samuelson--83 Fieldnotes 
page 57 
coats on. A few kids were helping out by bussing tables and 
setting up place settings. I didn't see any wives around though. 
There were no tip cans either. Orders were taken on pre—printed 
order pads and picked up at the Henry F. Heitz Memorial Kitchen 
(which had a plaque that was dated August 10, 
1974). 
The room had a very masculine, clubhouse feel to 
it. There 
was paneling and dark brown curtains, trophy cases, framed 
pictures, plaques, dartboard, loudspeakers, a pool table with a 
Budweiser beer light over it. The table was being used for 
silverware, place mats, napkins, pitchers). 
There was also an 
elaborate bar (not dispensing at this time however). I saw an old 
(1880) list of fire company members on one wall. The only female 
touch was 
a ladies auxiliary plaque. 
The food was really good. Choice of pancakes and sausage or 
bacon; or eggs (any style) and sausage or bacon with home fries 
and a roll. Elaine and I both had the sausage and pancakes. 
The workers started at 5 A.M. but it seemed that different 
shifts came on to relieve each other. The "waiters" were very 
attentive, always filling up coffee or juice cups. Although there 
was no line when we arrived about 9:15 there were plenty of 
people waiting when we 
left. As with other meals of this sort, 
take—out items were also available. 
TX02: This afternoon Jens, Mary and I gave presentations as part 
of the Pinelands Commission's fall 
lecture series 
in Southampton. 
On the way back Jens and I were driving along Retreat Rd. and my 
eye was caught by a house with fantastic Halloween decorations. 
The house was 
in the G—Retreat; 21GT area, but I can't identify it 
precisely. Will have to go back and get the name of the cross 
road where it 
is 
located; I think it 
is on the corner of Retreat 
Rd. 
and Philo's Bridge Road. We got out of the car to ask 
permission to take pictures and met the owners, Harry and Johanna 
Farley. They are from north Jersey and New York City and retired 
down here 5 years ago. He 
is a former comptroller and they 
obviously have some money to put into the house. They bought this 
old house, barn, chicken coop and assorted other buildings and 
have had a ball with them. 
Mrs. Farley is very interested 
in arts and crafts. In the 
barn she dries herbs--tarragon, rosemary, rosehips, sage, mint 
(which she will use as a cutting to start next year's crop). She 
makes grapevine wreaths with dried flowers and does sign 
stenciling and other crafts 
in the upstairs part of the barn. One 
side of the barn had lots of old farm implements hanging on 
it. 
They have tried keeping chickens but foxes got to them. On 
the back of the chicken coop were the beginnings of some murals 
of 
local birds which were done and signed and dated by the 
Farleys' grandchildren from California. We walked around the yard 
and I took pictures. Mrs. Farley pointed out areas in the woods 
Samuelson--83 Fieldnotes 
page 58 
where they found lots of panes of glass dumped where a liquor 
store used to be. They also have a pond (or creek?) on their five 
acres where people have caught snapping turtles. 
Mrs. Farley is a member of the Southampton Historical 
Society and was making signs for them. She 
is good friends with 
Mary Ann Thompson. She and her husband both do a lot of community 
service work, feel that it's very important. She 
is on committees 
for several 
local hospitals and her husband does the accounts as 
a volunteer at the 
local 
library. 
She has tried to learn a lot about local plants, such as the 
5 different kinds of 
leaves of an sassafras tree. One kind of 
leaf 
is hard to spot so you're lucky if 
you do. 
She invited Jens and I in for tea. Her kitchen is an 
archtypal modern/country kitchen. Plenty of appliances--
coffeemaker, blender, microwave oven but with baskets hanging 
from the ceiling and rag rugs and "naive art" placements. It was 
delightful talking to her there, a very cozy place, complete with 
a cat named Petunia. 
She took us on a tour of the rest of the 
house. She learned how to do stenciling at a class and had done a 
lot of that. Cut out floral designs from a sheet and used them on 
the walls, same with wall paper designs. Each room had a 
different theme: a white, bed and breakfasty bedroom, a rose 
room, a Victorian room, a loft. Fabulous rooms that cannot be 
described. A lot of money and care has been put into them. Part 
of me really responded to them and I meant it when I told Mrs. 
Farley that I would love to have a house like that some day. 
The best words to describe a situation like the Farleys 
house, yard and land 
is hybrid or creole. They are 
in the process 
of becoming locals (but certainly not natives) and perhaps being 
as accepted as outsiders can hope to be. They are devoted to the 
community, concerned about preservation. Are really concerned 
about a guy down the road who wants to put in a campground and 
has the Pinelands Commission's approval but they are hoping the 
township will block the development. They are trying to 
learn 
about local use of plants and animals, both from talking to 
people and reading and taking classes. They might be interesting 
to follow—up on as outsider/insider combinations.

TX01: I drove around G—Southampton; 21GT Township today. First 
located the crossroad to the Farleys house (the people I visited 
yesterday). They do 
live on the corner of Retreat Rd. and 
Philo's Bridge Rd. I took Big Mile Rd. north from Rt. 70 on the 
way to Retreat Rd. and passed several houses with interesting 
yard art. One was a new house with a swimming pool 
(on the west 
side of the road) and the other, older, house was on the east 
side. 
Drove over to Buddtown, up to Pemberton, over to 206 and 
then down through Vincentown. Followed the signs for the Jersey 
Jerry apple orchards and took some pictures of apples trees that 
were really sagging under the weight of the fruit. I followed 
Church Rd. and Chairville Rd. out to where it connects with 
Rt.70. Going east on Rt. 70 I stopped at a place that had caught 
my eye a few weeks ago. 
It was a stand advertising native New 
Jersey produce and crafts. I talked briefly with the owner, Don 
Curtis, 859-3572. He 
is calling the place Jersey Roots and 
is 
using it as a marketplace for local people to sell 
the stuff they 
collect in the woods and for crafts they make from local 
materials. There were cedar slab bird houses, grapevine wreaths, 
painted pumpkins, regular pumpkins, cordwood, and some plants. 
There will be an interior area too, hopefully ready by the end of 
October. 
Mr. Curtis is from Mt. Holly, has had some training as a 
landscape architect. He has been working for an outfit that does 
landscaping and also a lot of permit work, woodcutting I would 
imagine. He seems really committed to this idea of providing a 
locally—run outlet for local products and activities. I will 
go 
back to 
interview him. Maybe he can also led us to other 
contacts. 
TX02: I drove down some side roads to 206, then got on Hawkin and 
Red Lion Roads into G—Tabernacle; 25GT. Stopped there at a very 
lavish farm market to buy pumpkins. Missed the Vincentown Rd. and 
ended up going all 
the way down Rt. 532 to Chatsworth. It was a 
nice drive though.

After taking Carl Fleischhauer to the train station in 
Philadelphia I headed for Egg Harbor City via a rather circuitous 
route. I wanted to cruise Rt. 30 
in Chesilhurst 
to get a closer 
look at a nativity scene G—Waterford: 32GT I had spotted there 
weeks ago while on one of my forays with Elaine. I found it, near 
a house with the numbers 603 on 
it, which I assume means 603 
White Horse Pike, Chesilhurst. The nearest cross street (south) 
is Norris or Morris Rd. Another identifying feature is the 
location across the road of the Trilogy Restaurant. 
The nativity scene is an elaborate one. Looks like stone or 
cement figures set inside a stone/cement and glass enclosure 
which has 6 or 8 sides. There are also gold tinsel garlands and 
strings of colored lights inside, along the glass walls. The 
figures include the Holy Family, shepherds, wise men and a camel. 
There 
is no church nearby. I think the scene and 
its enclosure 
are associated with the house mentioned above. Similar stone 
figures can be seen on 
its balconies. It may have been an old 
restaurant or gas station. It looks inhabited (chairs and a grill 
outdoors) but is not terribly well kept. The ground around the 
nativity scene could use with a little mowing and weeding but the 
scene looks as though it remains viable. Maybe if 
I'm back 
in the 
area 
in December I can check up on 
it. 
Saw a potential photo opportunity, the White Horse Farm Market 
along (what else?) the White Horse Pike in Hammonton G-11GT. There 
is a big statue of a white horse situated near a gorgeous bed of 
marigolds. Since the pike 
is a main thoroughfare (and much more 
interesting than its high—speed counterpart, the Atlantic City 
Expressway), I think 
it warrents some kind of visual depiction 
that may came in handy later, especially if further research is 
done on all the farm markets that span that road from the 
Atlantic City area to the Philadelphia suburbs. 
My main goal today though was an event in Egg Harbor City, 
Halloween 
window painting 
on the main street through town, Rt. 
563 G—Egg Harbor City: 06GT. I received a call earlier this week 
from Mrs. Ruof, the wife of the minister at St. John's United 
Samuelson--83 Fieldnotes 
page 61 
Church of Christ. She told me that schoochildren from the 
Philadelphia Ave. School (public) and St. Nicholas School 
(Christian) would be painting Halloween 
scenes on the 
storefront windows of various merchants. The painting started on 
Wednesday and continued on Thursday and Friday (today). It 
is 
supervised by Mrs. Marge Helbig, the art teacher at the school. 
The "artists" are mainly 6-8th graders. They are supervised by 
Mrs. Helbig and several parents who also dispense paints and 
brushes from the back of a truck parked on the main street. I 
photographed about 10 windows in various stages of completion. 
The first, on a stereo/video store, had pumpkins and ghosts 
in 
bright orange and white. The next design (couldn't tell what kind 
of building) was done in an off—season red and green combination 
but had a dragon and other menacing figures. Mrs. Helbig said 
that the boy who did 
it was quite talented. Unfortunately, some 
high school kids had defaced the design the night before and some 
of 
it had to be scraped off and redone. 
A youngish—looking 8th grade girl was painting a witch's 
laboratory. It was quite an elaborate design and I chatted with 
her about how she liked to work alone and how she came up with 
her ideas ("I wanted something Halloweeny but something that 
hasn't been done before.") She seemed very serious about her work 
in contrast to two girls on the corner who were quite giggly and 
had deliberated painted the sidewalk instead of the window. One 
of the parents told me the girls 
would have to clean 
it up but 
since the paints were mixed with Ivory soap it would be fairly 
easy. 
On the other side of street a younger boy was doing a firey 
devilish scene that had been sketched by an older boy. The 
youngster was doing the coloring in 
part. Further down I 
encountered some Hispanic girls, perhaps two sisters, one 
painting very intently, the other watching in a rather adoring 
fashion. They had a large radio with them playing Spanish music. 
Some girls at another window also had a radio, this one tuned to 
a rock station. 
There seemed to be an equal number of boys and girls involved. 
There is a contest for the best painting but it 
is not a graded 
project. Mrs. Helbig first did 
it at this school 2 years ago but 
didn't do 
it 
last year. She says she can remember such painting 
activity from her childhood 35 years ago 
in Plesantville. 
The Rotary Club solicits merchants who want to have their windows 
done. The merchants are responsible for washing off the designs 
(again, a reason for mixing in the Ivory soap). This time there 
was some concern that it would rain and wash away the pictures. I 
asked 
if similar things were done at Christmas. The answer was 
no, 
it was too cold for the children then (It was very chilly out 
there today.) but that some commercial artists do them for 
stores

TX01: Since one food I would like to document in a series of 
event descriptions and photographs is the pumpkin, I decided to 
seek out some pumpkin farms and take shots of pumpkins au 
natural. Today I went to the G—Four Winds Farm; 25GT in Tabernacle 
on Medford Lakes Rd., Rt. 532. Courtesy prints should be sent to 
William J. Stevens, RR 8, Vincentown, NJ 08088. Phone is 
(609)268-9113. 
The reason I chose this farm was because of an article I had read 
in the Pemberton Community News (the local newspaper). The paper 
has columns for several of the lake communities and 
in the one 
for Country Lakes was an announcement of a pumpkin picking 
contest sponsored by the Country Lakes Women's Club. I called the 
contact name, Bonnie Townsend (893-6127) and asked if I could tag 
along. (Send her courtesy prints: 9 Maricopa Trail, Country 
Lakes, NJ 08015.) 
I arrived at the farm just a few minutes before the group did and 
then they poured in 
in a caravan of cars that had all 
driven 
in 
from Country Lakes. 
It was mainly couples and their kids or women 
and their children, maybe 30 people all 
told. Most of the kids 
were really little, 5 and 6 and under, with a few maybe 9 or 10. 
We boarded a flatbed trailer with some hay 
in 
it, 
pulled by a 
tractor driven by one of the Stevens men, the oldest son of 
William Stevens. I think 
it 
is 
he (the son) who actually owns the 
farm as his father said he 
is retired and just "helps out." 
The ride wasn't too long, maybe 1/8 mile to the pumpkin patch. It 
was pretty well picked over and I noticed as I was leaving that 
the truck was taking later people in another direction. The first 
row of pumpkins was for pies and gourds, the rest were what I 
think were called face pumpkins, meaning they were meant to be 
carved or painted. The group milled around selecting their 
pumpkins for about 10 minutes while the truck went back to the 
market area. When 
it returned with another load of people, the 
Country Lakes group boarded for the return trip. 
The pumpkins had already been cut from the vines. Most looked in 
good shape with only a few green or rotten ones. I was too busy 
Samuelson--83 Fieldnotes 
page 63 
9 
photographing to pay as much attention as I should have to the 
dynamics of how people were choosing the pumpkins. While round 
ones were obviously preferred some people did choose more 
elongated ones. The kids were encouraged to pick the ones they 
wanted and they tended to go for the first ones they saw while 
their parents suggested that they look at all 
of them and then 
choose. The forays were made 
in the family groups but no one was 
too far away from anyone else. 
Back at the market the pumpkins were weighed and purchased. The 
going price was about 15 cents a pound. Inside the market were 
other items for sale: stick hard candy, a cranberry—apple slush, 
T—shirts and caps, honey, jams and jellies, glass jars for 
canning. There was an interesting juxtaposition of old and new 
items--a museum exhibit poster of a flower painting, near a 
burlap bag hung on the wall, an old cash register next to a 
digital scale. The Stevenses have owned this farm since 1977 but 
say 
it has been around since the 1800s. 
The Country Lakes people piled back into their station wagons. 
The whole process didn't take more than 30 or 40 minutes which 
was probably about the right length considering the age of the 
children involved. Someone suggested that next year it be 
followed with a carving contest and Bonnie told the tractor 
driver that they would make 
it an annual event. 
Earlier I had heard Bonnie saying that this event was almost 
solely attended by new residents of Country Lakes. The first few 
minutes were spent introducing themselves. 
I guess new people 
are allowed to attend some of these things for free but otherwise 
have to join the Country Lakes Association, which has dues of a 
about $15 a year. 
It and the Women's Club sponsored various 
things, such as a Halloween party for the kids. Bonnie was trying 
to see if she could get pumpkins at the farm on Halloween Day to 
use as prizes at the party. 
We were not the only group there. Some Brownies and Girl Scouts 
were ahead of us and there was another group afterwards. Some 
individuals and families were also coming in and being trucked 
off through blueberry fields to the pumpkin patches. 
The farm 
offers public picking for strawberries, blueberries and 
raspberries too. Seems to attract a very suburbanish crowd. These 
were definitely people from developments, obviously middle class 
and reasonably affluent. 
Across the the road was another stand, mainly with pumpkins but 
which had some cornstalks tied around the trunks of trees. The 
visual 
impact was striking and I want to go back and photograph 
it. 
(I was too tired and cold to tackle it today.) 
TX02: Later I saw several other stands that arranged their 
pumpkins in clever/artistic ways, placing them on top of upended 
baskets or on the four corners of a small flatbed trailer. These 
Samuelson--83 Fieldnotes 
page 64 
were along G—Magnolia Road; 21GT in Pemberton. 
TX03: I had come back up to Rt. 70, then cut over on G—Burrs Mills 
Road; 23GT Along that road I saw a sign for the St. Nicholas 
Byzantine Mission but never saw the building associated with it. 
I need to do some more thinking about how the farm and produce 
market people use their wares 
in what seems to me to be 
artistic 
ways. Some people do so 
in the arrangement of vegetables in 
baskets, or the position of different kinds of vegetables next to 
each other, or the use of different modes of display--fences, 
floors, baskets, counters. At the Four Winds Farm there were 
several obviously arranged displays. The items possibly could be 
for sale but the way the were positioned marked them as something 
different. For instance, one group of pumpkins was near a planter 
with some flowers and also near a stone fence. This was away from 
the main market area, more towards where cars were parked. There 
were also some other buildings and a house nearby so 
it may have 
been a decoration effort more 
in connection with a yard than the 
market or else a marker for a transition between the commercial 
and domestic areas of the property. 
I'd 
like to ask about and make observations on this issue at the 
Putiris market too 
in Hammonton. How do the vendors, as distinct 
from the farmers (whose ideas are also important), feel about the 
food? What sorts of aesthetic responses do they have to 
it, 
how 
do they feel 
as they are arranging items, what kinds of 
experimentation are involved, what kinds of satisfaction or 
feelings of disturbance do they feel at looking at a display? Are 
there right and wrong wrong ways of doing it? 
TX04: This evening Elaine and I went to a 4—H Club Halloween 
party. It was at the G—Flora Lea Farm; 1BGT on Branin Rd. 
in 
Medford. Again, I had seen the announcement in the Pemberton 
Community News and since we will miss a lot of Halloween stuff 
because of the American Folklore Society meetings in Nashville 
next week. I thought this might be my only chance to document 
this holiday. 
It was a good choice as there was a lot going on. The party was 
held 
in the riding arena at this horse farm owned by the Adams 
family. (Elaine has most of the details 
in her field notes; she 
was the observer and I was the photographer tonight.) It started 
at 6:30 P.M. and we got there about 6:45. The first thing was a 
costume parade/contest with everyone marching in a circle. Lots 
of parents were there and their children represented all age 
groups from 1 year to the teens. The oldest group of 4—Hers, the 
senior council, planned the party. There were games for three 
different age groups, schoolchildren, pre—teens and teens. The 
games were very traditional; sack races, tying balloons to 
people's ankles and trying to pop them, passing apples from chin 
to chin and passing lifesavers with toothpicks. There was also a 
small plastic swimming pool where kids could bob for apples. Food 
was set up--soda, hot dogs, potato chips. 
Samuelson--B3 Fieldnotes 
page 65 
The costumes were very good--several punk rock outfits, 
ballerina, a whole family of cats, clown, Christmas tree, 
military, girls 
in bathrobes. Everyone seemed to be having a good 
time. 
It was well organized and well paced. There was also a 
haunted house with ghosts sliding down wires, balloons under the 
carpet (to pop), fake cobwebs, a chest with scary things in 
it, 
i.e., grapes for eyeballs and spaghetti for snakes. 
The lighting was absolutely awful, just a few lightbulbs way up 
high. We scrounged an extension cord and plugged in the our 
lights which helped somewhat but not a great deal. Also we pushed 
the film, even the black and white about to 1200. Took a lot of 
pictures and will hope that at least a few come out.

TX01: As I was collecting the mail this morning at the G—New 
Lisbon; 21GT Post Office I saw Jim Doyle, the postmaster, whom I 
had been trying to corral for several weeks for a walking tour of 
the village. I was very interested in knowing more about some of 
the old buildings along the main road, appropriately named New 
Lisbon Rd., and thought if anyone would know their history 
it 
would be Mr. Doyle. He was eager to do the walk right then so I 
rushed back to HQ, gathered together the Sony tape recorder and a 
camera kit, tapped Elaine to serve as photographer, and went back 
to New Lisbon. 
We started walking toward the south end of town, past some 
houses, an old church, the Fort Dix pumping station, a house that 
used to be a general store and gas station, the Tru—Blu Coop 
packing shed, one of the Rancocas branches that has been dammed. 
Of special 
interest was a hand lettered sign that read "Wildlife 
Sanctuary" (or was 
it Preserve?) erected by the Friends of the 
Rancocas. This is a local group of naturalist and environmentally 
concerned citizens, has some connection with Tom Darlington who 
owns a lot of 
land 
in the area. I mentioned it to Mary Hufford 
and she knew about the group. There is more discussion of the 
group and the sanctuary on the tapes (PFP83—ASS005/006). I found 
it very interesting, wonder how much legal authority they have. 
We walked north through the town, making a foray into the woods 
about a quarter of a mile to the east of the post office to see 
an area where there used to be a dance hall and then a day camp. 
Another branch of the Rancocas was dammed up north of town to 
create another, 
larger lake. 
(The two branches, running north and 
south of the town, join to form one riverbed to the west and east 
of New Lisbon.) It served as quite a resort for both locals and 
outsiders for many decades. Has only been drained in the last few 
years. Doyle seemed saddened by 
its 
loss and didn't like the look 
of the land since its disappearance. 
We walked over the dam that created this lake. The little bridge 
just south of the New Lisbon Rd/Springfield Rd. fork 
is over this 
area. We walked out onto the timbers that formed the dam, then 
back onto the road and down to the post office. Elaine did a good 
Samuelson--83 Fieldnotes 
page 67 
job taking photos, especially trying to capture pictures of the 
big cargo planes heading into Maguire Air Force Base. Maguire 
serves as a staging area for the Marines in Lebanon so 
it has 
been getting a lot of traffic lately. 
I enjoyed the visit with Mr. Doyle. He 
is a great guy, knows a 
lot about the area, having been a postmaster here for 20 years 
and his father for 30 years before that. Of course he knows 
everybody, was always waving at people as they drove by 
in their 
cars and trucks. He was one of the first people I met here and I 
knew instantly that he would be a good informant--intelligent, 
articulate, gregarious, likes people but seems to be without any 
jealousies or axes to grind. He 
is rather distressed though about 
the turn taken by this party he used to throw every Christmas 
season (see PFP83—FSS1013). Of course the tapes will have more 
details of our conversation. My general 
impression of New Lisbon 
though is of a sleepy little enclave, relatively isolated from 
Pemberton or Browns Mills. People pass through it along the New 
Lisbon Rd. but only stop to get the mail. Things were once 
busier, when the lake and the store were still around. Doyle says 
there are about a 100 houses within a mile radius but many are 
off the road and hard to see. 
I love New Lisbon, would like to 
live there. It appears to be 
mainly in the hands of Tom Darlington though. Hard to buy any 
land as he wants to keep it 
in his family. 
A little fiefdom, 
maybe? 
Couldn't get too much from Mr. Doyle about New Lisbon's status as 
a "border town" (my term) between the forest and agricultural 
areas of the Pinelands. It really does seem to me to sit right at 
the edge of the forest. Just to the north of town, along both New 
Lisbon and Springfield Roads there 
is pasture and farmland that 
starts to open up even more as you head towards Pemberton. As you 
back towards Browns Mills or Four Mile it stays pretty much 
in 
forest, although even that changes from a heavy deciduous/pine 
mix to a more throughly coniferous area 
I would like to get more 
feedback from the locals on this sense of place. Also find it 
interesting that the Pinelands Commission would choose such a 
transitional area for its headquarters. (Doyle gave some of the 
historical and political background for the Commission's choosing 
of the site for its headuquarters.)

TX01: Elaine and I went to G—Egg Harbor City; 05GT to 
interview the 
Rev. Dr. and Mrs. Richard (Anne) Ruof. He 
is the pastor of St. 
John's United Church of Christ, whose Apple Festival we attended 
in September. Mrs. Ruof called me a few weeks ago to tell me 
about the Halloween window painting that would be going on 
in Egg 
Harbor City. She also mentioned how weddings were so different in 
south Jersey from some of the other places they had lived and 
agreed to talk with us about them. 
It was great having an 
informant come to me and tell me things they knew and thought I 
would be 
interested 
in. 
It was a little hard to schedule an 
interview time as Mrs. 
Ruof does substitute teaching but we finally managed to connect 
today and learned a great deal. Unfortunately the Nagra was not 
working properly so I had to record everything with those 
traditional tools, pen and paper. It worked out quite well 
actually. I think taking notes like that makes me listen more 
carefully as I know I will not have a chance to go back over a 
tape later on. 
The Ruofs have lived 
in many places. She 
is from Ohio, he 
from the Pennsylvania 
Dutch country in Pennsylvania and they 
have pastored there. They have lived in the Shenandoah Valley and 
near the Appalachian mountains in Maryland. upstate New York, and 
have a house in Delaware too which is where they think they will 
retire. 
The first thing we talked about was weddings. They think the 
religious service 
is pretty much the same everywhere they've 
been; 
it's really 
in the reception that things change. Here (and 
in the Pennsylvania Dutch country, hereafter referred to as the 
Dutch, following the Ruofs's usage), anyone at the reception can 
start banging on a glass with a spoon 
and can be joined by 
others doing the same. The bride and groom then have to kiss or 
else the person keeps banging. Also the wedding party is formally 
introduced at the reception. They congregate outside the room and 
then are announced in the following order: bride's parents, 
groom's parents, ring bearer/flower girl/junior bridesmaid, 
Samuelson--83 Fieldnotes 
page 69 
bridesmaids with an usher (with the ones who had been standing 
furthest from the altar entering first--subtle ranking here!), 
maid or matron of honor, best man, bride and groom (introduced 
with a flourish). 
The reception is almost always a full course meal, either 
served or buffet. Because there is a regular meal the pastor is 
called upon to say grace. It 
is catered, but sometimes by 
relatives. It 
is never held at the church but rather in some kind 
of social hall--Smithville Inn, fire halls, country clubs, 
American Legion. Weddings are scheduled sometimes more than a 
year in advance 
in order to get the desired hall. The reception 
seems to be the big thing and the Ruofs says a lot of the 
variation comes 
in this "social approach" rather than in the 
religious component. Alcohol 
is always served and 
it may be for 
this reason, Ruof says, that people shy away from a church 
reception, because they think 
it might not be allowed. (He has no 
problem with it.) There 
is more social drinking in southern NJ, 
which Ruof attributes to the wine industry. 
Another constant is a band or DJ, usually playing very loud 
music. It 
is a band member that formally introduces the wedding 
party. Ruof thinks the band's presence could be due to the 
Italian influence 
in the area. The first dance is held before 
serving the meal. Mrs. Ruof mentioned that the bride's table 
is 
served first, even if 
it 
is a buffet. They may finish earlier and 
go from table to table visiting. The bride carries a long bag 
(like an evening bag) into which the guests put envelopes filled 
with money. Thus most do not bring gifts to the reception. Again, 
Ruof conjectures there might be an Italian basis to this. The 
Ruofs have never attended a purely Italian wedding. 
In the religious service there 
is a custom involving 
a 
unity candle that they see commonly here and only once 
in the 
Dutch country. After the couple is pronounced man and wife, the 
pastor hands them two candles, 
lit separately. They now profess 
their unity by 
lighting together a candle the pastor holds 
in his 
hands, then they put out their candles and the unity candle 
is 
left burning on the altar. Sometimes the coup►e is 
introduced to 
the assembled as Mr. and Mrs. 
 
 and on occasion the people 
attending have clapped, especially at the wedding of a couple who 
had lived together for 5 years! 
I asked Rev. Ruof how he 
learns about these local customs. 
The people involved may ask him to do specific things or he asks 
for personal contributions, what they want in the ceremony. He 
plays 
it by ear sometimes. One of things that bugs other pastors 
is the use of nicknames in the wedding vows. 
Both Rev. and Mrs. Ruof stressed how the social part of the 
wedding is 
so 
important in the community. One bride's mother went 
to work for 6 months so as to pay for the wedding. The Ruofs 
encourage involvement by the participants. What people do 
Samuelson--83 Fieldnotes 
page 70 
themselves, they take more interest in and the reception is 
usually where they are most involved. What they decide, they 
stand behind. 
Next we talked about funerals. In south Jersey there is more 
emphasis on eulogizing. Instead of 
talking 
about the next world 
people point to accomplishments in the present. This has some 
effect on theology too and the commentary segued into a 
discussion of how the Ruofs feel that people do not exhibit as 
much energy around here. The atmosphere is much more relaxed. May 
have something to do with the influence of the seashore or that 
the Egg Harbor area is south of the Mason—Dixon line. I found 
this very interesting it 
is discussed some more later on. 
In the Egg Harbor City cemetery (north of town on on Rt. 
561) many of the plots are covered with smashed colored glass (or 
small colored stones because it 
is difficult to get the glass 
nowadays) instead of sod. The justification for this was probably 
that grass doesn't grow well 
in the sandy soil and 
it 
it 
is also 
less expensive. There is a bell at the cemetery that is on a 
timer that plays hymns regularly. The bell tolls at the time of 
each burial. 
In comparison to the people they know in south Jersey, the 
Ruofs feel the Dutch are more forthright in facing death. In 
south Jersey there is an avoidance of mentioning inner fears in 
the ceremony. The Dutch lay 
it on the line, talk about it, think 
it's good to be honest in facing fear of the worst. 
Here people 
don't talk as frankly about death. But then fortunately, they 
also don't fight, not much conflict, nor as 
intense. The 
avoidance, Ruof surmizes, 
is because death is something out of 
control of most people. There 
is probably less cultural and 
religious indoctrination in these German churches than 
in the 
Dutch country, and thus the sense of a matter beyond control. 
(Would fit in nicely, I think, with German worldview, at least 
based on what I know of 
it and my own experience in being of 
German ancestry). 
Going back to people's involvement in activities, Ruof 
comments on how many leaders complain that it 
is difficult to get 
people involved. In 
service organizations or churches maybe only 
10-15% of the members will do general work projects. One cannot 
count on people to exert the effort, you're not sure people will 
be there. (There are notable exceptions, such as the Apple 
Festival.) You have to get a bigger organization in order to get 
enough people to insure that things will get done. Some possible 
reasons might be that people have to travel so far to get to work 
that they don't have much energy or time left over. There just 
may be a lower energy level 
in general, perhaps due to the 
climate. (The Ruofs sense this 
in themselves.) It mat be people 
need more time at home. 
As a pastor, Ruof feels he has to watch carefully how he 
Samuelson--83 Fieldnotes 
page 71 
alludes to social or moral "faults." In the Dutch country people 
expect frank preaching, here they find it negative in effect. 
Ruof's background is German (with some Swiss), Irish, 
Scotch—Irish, English (with some French). A good example of the 
American multi—ethnic. 
The Egg Harbor City is a German cultural area. It was part 
of an early (1870s) string of settlements on the railroad line 
between Atlantic City and Philadelphia. The German community was 
intended as a refuge for Germans already 
in the United States who 
could not acclimate. People wanted to really keep 
it strongly 
Germanic. Blacks who moved into the area had to 
learn German in 
order to go to school and get along. But there were not as many 
dissatisfied Germans as was expected. 
This discussion of Egg Harbor City's history slid into an 
interesting conversation on ethnic identity. 
Ruof assumes that 
saying "I'm Italian" or "I'm German" is a way of 
identifying 
oneself as "what kind of American" one 
is. 
In the Pennsylvania 
Dutch country everyone can say "I'm Dutch," 
it provides a strong 
sense of 
identity because of which people know what they're 
supposed to do. 
Here there are several ethnic groups. The different 
backgrounds are noticeable in the politics. With the Italians, 
Germans, Blacks and Hispanics mix 
it 
is hard to get total 
agreement. The Spanish are used to dealing with each other on a 
friendly, personal basis. You know the guy 
in charge who can take 
care of things. People of English or German background are more 
inclined to want to discuss the issues. There is a sense of 
frustration. 
Because there's no majority people use different methods to 
get what they need. Ruof feels this "does something to the sense 
of 
importance, the sense of 
identity" that people have. 
It 
is a 
result of a democratic kind of government but makes it hard for 
people to rally around issues. They wonder, "How will things get 
done?" People try to succeed, want to feel good and work hard, 
but then they see values broken down and see aspects of their 
identity damaged. They find 
it hard to become motivated. 
The ethnic mix 
in some ways 
is deflating. Perhaps Americans 
didn't melt into one kind of people, they're afraid to melt, to 
lose their identity. Democracy depends on pluralism, on the 
strength of cultures. The extended family is becoming dissipated. 
Italian families as more recent immigrants still try to exert 
control. When mixed marriages between kids from Italian and 
German families became more common, some of the older people felt 
hurt. Now Italian mothers may feel that when sons marry German 
girls 
it will break up the family structure and religion. Ruof 
would have liked to have attempted some reconciliation in such 
instances but didn't feel that there was 
much that he could do. 
Samuelson--83 Fieldnotes 
page 72 
However, ethnic and racial relationships in Egg Harbor are the 
best the Ruofs have experienced . 
Ruof feels that religious identity is extremely important. 
Feelings of personal worth and value motivate morality in people. 
along with a commitment to a higher being. He talked about the 
Emmanuel Congregational Church in Egg Harbor City and the school 
associated with 
it, 
the Pilgrim Academy. He thinks it's very 
important for children to get some religious/moral 
instruction at 
school (i.e., 
in all 
experiences of 
life). 
In the public schools 
it's all 
been stripped away and the kids are so tired after 
school and homework that they don't have the energy for 
additional religious instruction. Because the moderate churches 
have adapted to public school 
instruction they may ultimately 
lose members; the conservative churches are growing rather than 
ebbing in strength because they are satisfying the needs of the 
younger generation as well. 
The next life cycle custom we discussed was christening. 
Ruof feels rather distressed by the ceremony because he feels 
parents don't have the means by which to take the vows seriously 
and they abandon their sense of responsibility for the child's 
religious training. 
Except in 
10 or 20% of the cases the child 
spend most of his/her time in a non—Christian atmosphere. A 
church, by definition, 
is something people are born into. 
Conversion occurs at 3 months. The child will grow up 
in the 
church, 
it's all they've ever known. Ruof considers this the 
"moderate" viewpoint. But he says Infant Baptism is an avoidance 
of reality. 
He feels sort of 
let down about christening 
celebrations. There 
is usually a party afterwards (and then there 
is a letdown). He thinks christening is 
in danger of extinction 
if Christian education/guidance of childhood experiences 
continues to be treated in the current cavalier manner. The 
parents need to find ways to make good their vows or else 
discontinue it. He feels a little like a traitor when he does 
one. Ruof says culture comes out of reality and that religious 
realities are fading. Government replaces many of the values. 
Government invades, decimates self—image. An example 
is with 
having American flags at the altar. 
If they are at the altar the 
government decrees that the flag must be to the right (stage 
right) of Christ on the cross. This kind of decree implies the 
church is no 
longer a sanctuary. Flags used to be on the level 
of 
the congregation .Now they must be displayed 
in such a way as to 
show that loyalty to country is above God. 
People want the flags 
displayed according to stated protocol so there is 
strong 
conflict. 
Next we talked about the Pinelands Commission. Real estate 
speculation led to buying up of land by individuals which was 
then reevaluated as forest land and people lost money. Ruof 
thinks people caught in such situations have a legitimate gripe. 
It 
is hard to get a consensus on the Commission because it really 
Samuelson--83 Fieldnotes 
page 73 
doesn't have any identity. Government needs to be more sensitive. 
Elaine asked about how women are responsible for the 
religious upbringing of the kids. Ruof had some very specific 
things to say about how sex roles are produced and/or influenced 
by American popular mass culture. Man 
is seen as a boy growing 
up, who runs around as a teenager, then settles down. A good 
woman helps to keep him tied down. He works to support her. The 
women are the ones who come to church. Two thirds of Ruof's 
congregation on Sunday morning are women. The husband has worked 
hard all week so wants to take the weekend off. She works hard 
too, but continues. 
Women hold the baby at christening, traditionally in 
Christian practice it was the man. 
Funeral arrangements are made by the one closest to the 
deceased, may be male or female. 
In the Dutch country the men speak up even 
if they to 
explode, the women keep their heads but say less. Here the women 
speak up and men are often silent. 
There may be an historical/economic basis to the situation. 
50 years ago men away at work. They were the breadwinners but 
sometimes couldn't bring home much. Women were in charge of the 
home and were more constant and stable in role.Perhaps because of 
the tourist industry which was so unstable and absent in winter 
men felt less 
in control. Women were the ones 
holding things 
together. 
Men take care of the yard, garden, flowers. They love to 
garden. In the Dutch country the women are the ones doing so. 
Mrs. Ruof 
is of Greek (father), English/Dutch, Irish, 
Scotch—Irish and Welsh background. The family's Greekness was 
stressed but not as 
is was for most Greek immigrants because her 
father was a Greek Protestant and her grandfather a minister. 
There was a strong European family structure, 
lots of Greek 
cooking, mother tried hard to emphasize Greek ancestry. Lived in 
central Ohio, town of Worthington. Grandparents were college 
graduates, connected with the American Mission Board. All college 
graduates, 7 professors among her father's siblings. Northern 
Greeks are blond and blue eyed. 
I really enjoyed interviewing the Ruofs. They are 
intelligent, articulate. Their experience in other parts of the 
country enables them to compare different cultural features but 
because of their pastoral role they are welcomed into the current 
community and are soon exposed to many of its 
inner workings. 
They have a great respect and affection for their fellow south 
Jerseyans, despite some of the problems they see 
in the area. I 
think they recognize that such problems are not just limited to 
Samuelson--83 Fieldnotes 
page 74 
this region. Indeed, their comments about government and 
schooling and religion can easily be applied to many other 
communities in the country

TX01: Today I visited with Ada M. Simons. She lives in the 
Tabernacle area on G—Morse Meadows Road; 25GT. Mailing address is: 
RD 10, Vincentown, NJ 08088. Phone: (609)268-0687. I was referred 
to her by Betsy Carpenter (via Christine) as an expert on 
cranberry cookery. 
I had a hard time finding Ada's house. I enjoyed driving out 
there from Tabernacle along the Carranza Rd. There are several 
farms and horse farms, big fields with forested fringes. Lots of 
sky and a feeling of space. Then the trees start to cluster 
alongside the road. There are some development—style houses. The 
road narrows and more pines mix in with the deciduous trees. Some 
of the trees still have their autumn colors. Very picturesque. I 
could really feel 
like I was making the transition from the 
agricultural area to the forest. The area of Morse Meadows Rd. 
is 
very piney at first, then opens up to some blueberry fields. I 
went past Ada's house and drove along the elevated edge of one 
big bog, right next to a ditch. Passed a hunting club/lodge 
called Lone Oak. Realized I was lost and headed back 
in the 
"right" direction. It actually took me two trips to find the 
place; the first foray I had had to go back into Tabernacle 
and 
call 
her for more precise directions. 
We started out by talking about cranberry growing in general. She 
was adamant in her description of 
it as "hard work." The ground 
for a new bog has to be cleared of trees and brush and dams are 
built. At first everything is "in the rough, just natural." Water 
is 
of great importance, either from ditches, or overhead or 
underground pipes. The plants are vines, started from cuttings 
about 6 inches long. When planted by hand in the early 1900s when 
her family started growing cranberries, whole families would 
work, even the children. They would be given a bag full of vines 
which would be pushed into the ground with a punch—like 
instrument and stomped on with the foot to close up the hole to 
keep 
it from drying out. 
Along with several of his brothers, Ada's father started growing 
cranberries in the Tabernacle area about 30 years ago. When I 
Samuelson--83 Fieldnotes 
page 76 
asked why he chose to raise cranberries, she said "it was 
something natural for the ground, they already grew wild." Her 
father's family is from England but immigration took place 
several generation before. 
Nowadays cranberry agriculture is mostly mechanized. The cut— 
harrow scatters the vines, which are "broadcast" over, rolled 
firm into the ground. Once started a bog 
is permanent, except for 
fire. There is one nearby, Ada says, that has escaped fire and 
is 
over 70 years old. After being planted a bog takes a few years to 
start producing--3 years is great, 4 about average. 
Sand 
is put over the bogs 
in the winter to keep the vines from 
growing up. They are also flooded because the water keeps them 
from heaving out (like a roadbed bulges because of freezing and 
thawing). The water also helps to protect from frost, 
is present 
from December to April or May, when the danger of frost is past. 
The vines blossom in 
the spring and bees are essential. Harvest 
is from mid—September through October. It's sometimes a real 
fight against the frost in the spring and winter. This summer 
another problem was the heat and lack of water which produced 
something Ada called "burnt bloom." 
Because of mechanization the bogs have to be level. Ditches get 
in the way so that is why underground irrigation is so popular. 
Ada says her son, George, who runs the family's cranberry 
business now, 
is trying to get underground irrigation for their 
bogs. 
Asking these kind of background questions on cranberry farming 
gave me some time to observe Mrs. Simons and lead into questions 
on cooking with cranberries. Most of the berries they raise go to 
Ocean Spray for sauce and drinks (Cranapple, Crangrape). On her 
own she makes cranberry sauce, pies, and jelly. 
Also her own 
juice. You cook the berries with enough water (probably to 
cover), strain them, cook again with sugar, and bottle. You can't 
make too much at one time or 
it won't drain through the bag 
properly. 
Ada was rather vague about the recipe. She knew how to 
do 
it, didn't refer to any written recipe, and seemed reluctant 
to discuss it much so I didn't press. 
She did have a cookbook called The Cranberry Connection, 
Cranberry Cookery with Flavors, Fact and Folklore. It was given 
to her by a granddaughter. The author is Beatrice Rose Buszak 
from Cranberrie Cottage, Nova Scotia. Published by Stephen Green 
Press, Brattleboro, VT 05301. Ada was looking through it to show 
me a picture of a cranberry blossom as I had expressed my 
ignorance of this phase of the cranberry's growth cycle. She says 
that because of the way cranberries hang by stem from the vine 
they look 
like cranes and thus were originally called 
"craneberries." 
Ocean Spray controls the yields on the cranberry crops and 
growers are sometime ordered to dump extra berries. If there are 
Samuelson--83 Fieldnotes 
page 77 
more than can be used they are "condemned." 
Other foods items made with cranberries inclue bread and muffins. 
Cranberry liquor is made with fresh cranberries and gin, put in 
jars and turned each day. Ada found a recipe for it: 
Cranberry Liquor 
4 c. 
cranberries 
2 c. 
sugar 
2 c. 
gin 
Chop the cranberries. Add 
sugar, gin. Put 
in a jar; turn jar upside down. Turn everyday 
for three weeks. Drain. Save cranberries for 
garnish over ice cream, etc. 
Relish is made from raw cranberries, orange and sugar. 
Ada has talked to Ocean Spray about mixing cranberries and 
blueberries for a juice or drink but they say the mixture would 
be too cloudy. She did have a recipe for a pie containing both 
kinds of berries: 
"Cranbleberry" Pie 
1 1/2 cups raw, chopped cranberries 
1 cup blueberries 
3/4 cup sugar 
3 tablespoons cornstarch 
1/4 tsp. salt 
pastry for 2—crust 9" pie 
Mix berries. Combine sugar, cornstarch and salt and stir into 
berries. Spread into pastry lined pan, add top crust and bake at 
400' until juice bubbles and crust is nicely browned. 
By Mrs. Lee Baughn 
Synder, Texas 
The recipe comes from a newspaper clipping that has been copied 
onto a piece of paper. 
Her daughter makes something that sounds like a cobbler with raw 
cranberries and a batter that "goes down through them." 
Ada used to live on Rt. 206. Moved here 
in December, 1960, to 
take rare of her ill 
mother. When asked if she likes 
it here she 
said that you stay where you can make your living. She also said 
that people have to be energetic and resourceful to make a living 
off the land. Interesting contrast to the lack of energy Rev. 
Ruof referred to. What is different about Egg Harbor that makes 
people more "laid back?" 
If they're not so tied to the land as 
agriculturalists (but perhaps still as hobbyists, woods walkers, 
gardeners) 
is there less of a need to devote energy to what you 
do to earn a living? 
I found it rather difficult to talk to Mrs. Simons. She was nice 
but distant. Maybe she couldn't quite figure out why I was there. 
On the phone she seemed really quite skeptical of what she could 
offer. Said she didn't know anything more about cranberry cookery 
than anyone else would around the area. As I started to wrap up 
the conversation she took me onto her front porch where there was 
Samuelson--83 Fieldnotes 
page 78 
a wooden crate of cranberries which her son had dry scooped for 
her. She indicated that they were special, having been sorted and 
only the finest ones put in the box. She showed me some that 
still had the stems and vines attached and filled up a paper bag 
for me to take home. Then we walked over to the blueberry packing 
shed and she showed me several more crates of cranberries, 
including one really big one 
like I've seen on some of the big 
trucks around here. She gave me some more (unsorted) berries and 
we walked the short distance back to her house. 
The house 
is small but cozy. Had a living room with a table and 4 
easy chairs, a sofa, TV. Cheery curtains with an autumn leaf 
motif. A small kitchen. A few bedrooms curtained off. Chickens 
and what she called guineas 
in the yard outside. 
I left with mixed feelings about the visit. I got some recipes 
and an idea of how cranberries are used. They are a prominent but 
not dominant food in the region. Probably taken somewhat for 
granted just because they are so plentiful. How does a staple 
crop tie 
in emotionally as an item of consumption? Is 
it 
romanticized, revered? Probably not because in this area people 
have a lot of 
locally raised produce and they are also exposed to 
mass produced foods items as well. But it 
is a concept I want to 
think about some more.

TXO1: The Putiris invited Elaine and I to dinner so we showed up 
on their doorstep at about 5 P. M. G—Elwood; 12GT. 
It took a while 
to get around to dinner, about 6:20 or so. There was a scripture 
reading and grace before the eating started. Sal Sr. had made a 
big salad with endive, carrots (some of the best I've ever tasted 
but I couldn't pin him down as to where they had come from), 
radishes, 
lettuce, celery, wide range of bottled dressings. Salad 
was served on plates but Sal Sr. got a bowl for his. Paper 
napkins were placed at the extreme right of the place setting, 
even to the right of the spoon.The main dish was rigatoni with 
homemade tomato sauce (called gravy) and meatballs and sausage. 
Sal 
did most of the cooking but disappeared shortly before dinner 
to take cousin Claude (who works 
in the market) home. Ralph 
evidently did most of the cleaning that day. He was very proud of 
having shampooed the living room carpet. 
Wine was served with dinner. Sal 
Jr. said he hd an uncle who was 
a wine connoisseur. Served a very dry cabernet sauvignon from 
Yugoslavia. Also available were cider, soda or water. 
Sal Sr. showed us a book (can't remember the title but 
it was 
printed in 1921)) with a poem entitled "A. D. 2000." The poem was 
about what historians would think about the early 20th century a 
century later. We felt it was a rather sly commentary on our 
presence, sort of 
like "What are all these strangers going to 
think about us, especially when they get removed from us 
in time 
and space?" Sal also showed us some early editions of Rudyard 
Kipling's work and his high school year book, Woodbury High 
School, class of 1937. He was 
in the chemistry club, drama, was a 
cheerleader. Lots of the pictures were of activities and 
organizations that are still popular today in high school. Not 
that much has changed. 
Both the TV set and the radio were on, competing for everyone's 
attention. The radio was tuned to a station where Sal 
and Ralph 
knew the DJ. 
It was a call—in request show and they asked us for 
songs. I wanted "Some Enchanted Evening" (was the only "oldie" 
kind of song I could think of) but they didn't have it. Sal 
Samuelson--83 Fieldnotes 
page 80 
wanted "Up a Lazy River" and that's what they played "for Sal Sr. 
in Elwood." Later on Ralph called in and they played "Sunshine, 
Lollipops and Rainbows" "for Ralph 
in Elwood and his girlfriend 
Sue Ellen." Guess he had asked for it for Sue and Ellen (he has 
trouble remembering Elaine's name sometimes). Elaine thought this 
sequence of events was a way for Sal and Ralph to show us who 
they knew and demonstrate a little bit of the clout they have in 
the community. 
Shortly after we started eating we were joined by a women named 
Sally, a family friend. 
She comes over every weekend to clip 
coupons (for the men?) out of the Sunday paper. I think she was a 
good friend of Mrs. Putiri's. 
TX02: After dinner Ralph took us to Emmanuel Congregational 
Church in G—Egg Harbor City; 05GT. his 
is a conservative Christian 
congregation with John E. Sahl 
as pastor. Ralph wanted to 
introduce us to Joseph Sahl and his wife. They are potato farmers 
and have a scripture quotation painted on one of the buildings on 
their property. They were very friendly and would probably 
welcome a visit but we doubt if there'll be time right now to do 
so. 
We also met Bob Peterson, the head of the church's school, 
Pilgrim Academy (which Rev. Ruof's son attends). He is a local 
history buff, writing a book about the history of Egg Harbor City 
and also writes a history column for the Egg Harbor City News. He 
went over to his house and brought back lots of old postcards and 
pictures of the town. This invited some commentary from other 
people still 
lingering 
in the sanctuary and I wished we could 
have recorded their comments. I was intrigued that all 
of this 
was occurring in the church proper. Some teenage girls were 
practicing the piano too and their was lots of talking, etc. 
Nothing loud or raucous but definitely energetic. I'm used to 
seeing more of this socializing going on 
in a foyer. But at St. 
John's United Church of Christ, after the Harvest Home service 
that Jens and I documented in October, there was a lot of similar 
activity in the sanctuary. Perhaps because the foyer areas are 
small and other "social" areas are awkward to adjourn to. Or else 
these people feel 
so at home in the chapel, that God's house 
is a 
house, to be treated with respect to be sure, but also a place 
where people can feel at ease. 
Elaine enjoyed the sermon but I really wasn't getting the point 
so 
I spent a lot of time looking at the church. It looked as 
though it had been remodeled or expanded recently. There were 
rows of memorial stained glass windows along the sides. Flags 
were .slightly above the 
level 
of the congregation, with the 
American flag at stage right as Rev. Ruof had told us 
last week. 
There was an organ at stage right and a grand piano at stage 
left. A table 
in the middle (communion table I guess) with a 
scripture carved in 
its side and a floral display. Several wood 
and upholstery throne—like chairs were in back of that where 
Samuelson--83 Fieldnotes 
page 81 
Pastor Sahl was seated. The walls were painted a rather stark 
white. The ceiling was arched like a boat's hull 
and there were 
horizontal trusses from side to side. 
After chatting with people post—service, Ralph drove us around 
Egg Harbor City. He was trying to 
locate the Moravian Church 
there on St. Louis Ave. Finally did so but only after pausing to 
ask directions at the Liberty Beer Garden. He said it was an 
interesting place inside. 
It was a bar, no real garden to speak 
of, but might be interesting to investigate in terms of the 
city's German history. Ralph also drove us past the St. Nicholas 
Catholic Church, commenting on how it was sometimes difficult for 
him to appreciate the starkness of the churches he attends after 
having attended services in the elaborate Catholic churches of 
the area for so many years. 
Ralph drove a rather fancy car, a Toronado. I thought this was 
interesting in 
light of what he told us about not having a car as 
a teenager and not living 
in town and thus not knowing a lot 
about the places where teenagers hung out. 
As we drove back towards the house I asked Ralph about the number 
of produce stands on the White Horse Pike. He said that between 
Atlantic City and Hammonton there are 7, 
used to be 11. Tried 
once to have a formal association of the owners but it didn't 
work out. Several of the markets we passed he pointed out as 
belonging (or once belonging) to members of his extended family. 
He also pointed out a glass and china shop run by a member of the 
Ravelli family who married a Messina girl. The Messinas are good 
glassblowers and cutters. The shop 
is 
the 6th biggest Noritake 
place in the country. 
TX03: G—Elwood; 12GT Back at the house we chatted some with Sal 
Jr. 
and his girlfriend Linda Goff, whom we had met several weeks 
earlier while watching Sal paint pumpkins. 
There was a movie on 
TV, Gene Wilder and Richard Pryor in "Stir Crazy" that again was 
competing with the radio. Sally was still there and joined us for 
dessert--a truly amazing confection called "icebox cake." Layered 
in 
an oblong serving 
dish were crushed graham crackers, 
chocolate pudding, sliced bananas, more crushed graham crackers, 
vanilla pudding, lite 
(low calorie) canned fruit cocktail. It 
was dished out into bowls and topped with canned whipped cream. 
Very sweet. 
As we were eating the dessert the conversation turned to the 
topic of demons, especially the Jersey Devil. Linda asked us 
if 
we had heard about it. She said she wouldn't go to Leeds Point 
where it supposedly was born. 
Elaine told her about the picture 
of the devil 
in some smoke at a fire. Ralph indicated that he 
believed in demons and that the Jersey Devil could be a 
masquerading demon. No one said they didn't believe in 
it. Ralph 
told us a story about how he and Sal Jr. had heard strange noises 
coming from the forest one night about 15 years ago. Something 
Samuelson--83 Fieldnotes 
page 82 
came and sat under their bedroom window and continued to make 
this awful noise. They never saw it but implied that it was the 
Jersey Devil. 
This led to other stories. Linda talked about a boy who had hung 
himself and how she had heard the mother scream when she 
discovered the body and how it was the most awful sound. Sal 
talked about a dead uncle who appeared in a photograph taken of 
other family members in Florida about 6 months after his death. 
Ralph remembered how three female relatives had come 
in a house 
(their house?) and saw their grandfather sitting in a chair 
reading the paper. They held hands, went into the kitchen and 
when they looked again he was gone. Ralph said that his mother 
saw someone walk into her bedroom once. Thought it was one of the 
boys until she realized the thing was too short. When she tried 
to wake Sal Sr. 
it disappeared. 
We talked some about Christmas celebrations. Fis 
dinner on Christmas Eve--shrimp, smelt,

Sometime during the evening we discussed grave blankets a little. 
The laurel and princess pine are dipped in aluminum paint. Takes 
4-5 minutes to put the grave blanket together and 15 minutes to 
decorate it. Some of the wholesale ones are decorated by others, 
such as florists. The Putiris make about 1000 in the season. Bob 
Peterson was aware of them, he buys them (is of Swedish and 
German background). He told us about clay decorations in the Egg 
Harbor Cemetery that people used to paint fresh every year. He 
also mentioned the layout of the cemetery, how the Germans are 
in 
the middle, Italians 
out from there and others at the edges. 
Someone made a comment about strangers who don't have any roots 
in the town, have no concern for the community. Bob was quite 
proud of being able to point to buildings and places that were 
tied to his family history and to the history of the place. This 
seemed very important to him. 
It was an enjoyable evening. More of social occasion than an 
interview, which was what the Putiris wanted. (Eileen Homiller 
indicated a similar interest after our interview with her on 
11/10/83; wanted us to come back for a social call.) We were 
still paying a lot of attention to what was going on though.

Elaine and I went to G-Lower Bank; 26GT to interview Eileen 
Homiller. We started in her kitchen with Elaine spreading out a 
USGA topographic quadrangle map and asking Eileen for place name 
information. Next we went on a tour of the yard with Elaine 
sketching out a map and I taking pictures. 
It was quite a place, 
especially the barn with pony Cocoa and goat Clover. There was 
also an 
interesting depression created by removing gravel to 
build the road. This pit used to have water in 
it and a little 
rowboat for the kids and ice skating during the winter. 
It started to rain so we went back inside for some hot chocolate 
and more talk. Eileen seemed to really enjoy the visit and 
invited us back for just a "social visit" should we ever be 
in 
the area again. 
Going on these wrap-up visits 
is sort of rough in that we don't 
know if we'll be back for phase two, or even 
if anyone will 
return, so 
it 
is hard to create a sense of closure with the 
informants. We do 
our best though and at least can look forward 
to sending courtesy prints as a sort of "final" gesture. 
Eileen really impressed me with her love for her house, 
land and 
community. She seems so thoroughly at home, so rooted 
in the 
area. I like that stability, especially since it 
is so real. I 
almost said unselfconscious but in some ways I think she really 
is aware of her connections to people, things and area around 
her, perhaps because of having lived in Philadelphia for a while. 
Having left the area and returned may make her more appreciative 
and also provides comparative data for her to asses the way she 
lives now with what she knows other lifestyles to be.

TX01: Tonight I finally got to see the famous Pinelands Cultural 
Society's Albert Hall 
in G—Waretown; 52GT. A group of us went: Mary 
Hufford, Jay Orr (up from DC for the weekend), Boris Weintraub (a 
visiting reporter from the National Geographic News Service), and 
Elaine Thatcher. Albert Hall was really a surprise. I was driving 
one car and following Mary. When she pulled into a shopping 
center I thought it was another one of her cute little tricks or 
that she needed something from the Cumberland Farms store that 
was still open. But, no, she insisted that this was the place and 
sure enough we followed her down a driveway and there was a 
lighted sign with flashing lightbulbs announcing the location of 
Albert Hall. 
Cautiously we entered, plunked down our $2 a piece for admission. 
Sam Hunt, one of Mary's informants, was there and gave her a warm 
greeting. He was a great looking man, had gorgeous white hair. 
Turns out that he played with The Pineconers, the group 
in the 
Pines and the royalty of Albert Hall. They came on just as we got 
there, did about 6 songs. Then there was a break and we could 
check out our surroundings a little bit more thoroughly. There 
was a counter, sort of 
like a gift stand, that sold Albert Hall 
T—shirts, Piney Power caps and bumper stickers, Christmas crafts 
and the like. There was a great poster too, something about 
Albert Hall being the Pines' answer to Opryland. 
A snack bar dispensed hot dogs, soda, coffee, chips, candy. There 
we met Arlene Ridgeway, the compiler of the Chicken Foot Soup 
Cookbook on Pinelands foods. 
Elaine and I complimented her on 
the book and talked about some of the recipes, primarily the 
cranberry ones. She told us about a cranberry nut bread recipe 
that wasn't in there. She had gotten it off of a Bisquik box but 
had changed it. 
I've often wondered about how people react to 
their adaptations of printed recipes, whether from newspapers or 
cookbooks or boxes. When does 
it cease to be "theirs" and become 
"mine"? 
The hall 
itself has a high ceiling, supported by columns that 
look sort of 
like telephone poles. 
It 
looked as though the 
Samuelson--83 Fieldnotes 
page 85 
ceiling or walls in one corner weren't doing too well because 
they were being supported by pieces of 
lumber. On some of columns 
were signs saying "one way" or "Atlantic City Expressway." There 
were various other signs, posters, banjos, and clocks on the 
walls. Above the stage was a sign saying "Albert Hall." Stage 
entrances were both left and right. Stage was well 
lit, there was 
a sound board about a third of the way into the audience. Place 
was about half full. 
After the 10 minute intermission Merce Ridgeway and Arlene and 
their son Tom and 1 other musician started to perform. The two 
last songs they did were really good, "The Pine Barrens Song" 
(written by Merce's father) and "My New Jersey (or just Jersey?) 
Home." They were sung with a great deal 
of soul. 
Since Elaine was tired, she and Boris and I left after this act. 
We all thought it was a very interesting event. This is what 
people point to as being very Piney and 
is very well known. I 
find 
it somewhat forced but that is 
to be expected of something 
that is 
"on show." Of course there 
is much to be discussed about 
the "authenticity" or "Pineyness' of what's involved. I find 
myself wondering what the Dilkes people Christine and I met at 
the VFW pig roast would think of this. They were adamant about 
their Pineyness. Have they ever been here? Do they know about 
Albert Hall? Do they think it's Piney? I imagine there are a lot 
of conflicting responses to the place.

TXOI: Elaine and I visited the Zimmers again, down on G-Heidelberg 
Avenue; 12GT. We took a long walk 
in their woods. The walk began 
with releasing their beagle, Cricket, from his leash. He is tied 
up just at the place where the backyard starts turning into the 
woods. He has a doghouse, lined with fresh straw, but doesn't 
like 
it. He stayed with us briefly, then took off after a rabbit. 
We heard him barking many times throughout the walk. Mr. Z seemed 
to keep an ear out for him, could tell where he was. Thought 
maybe he was chasing deer too. We didn't see him again until he 
came trotting back during lunch. 
The Zimmers have one acre along the roadfront, then 5 acres deep. 
Their land 
is bordered by various relatives' 
land: her sister and 
brother-in-law (south), niece (north), brother (Ted Ramp?) and 
sister (Marian) (east?). There were some cleared paths for a 
while (heading east), then we veered off into the forest (north), 
then south along some of the low, swampy land, then roughly east 
again to Ted Ramp's sand pit where he used to have turkey shoots. 
This bark area, almost to Hamburg Ave., used to be Mrs. Zimmer's 
parents truck farm. The old family house 
is currently inhabited 
by her sister Marian and her 5 schnauzer dogs. 
Marian is 
in 
the 
process of restoring the house. Has rebuilt the fireplace, added 
on wood holding area (where the wood can be 
loaded from the 
outside), 
is planning on adding some bookcases to the other side 
of the fireplace, has opened up the stairway. We stayed briefly 
because her sister wasn't feeling well. Turned off the tape 
recorder during that part of the visit. Marian is a public health 
nurse in Atlantic City. Ted Ramp's furnace used to be around 
there too and I was encouraged by Mr. Z to pick up a piece of 
discarded glass from it. 
We started heading back towards the Zimmers, through the woods 
again. Had a rather intimidating encounter with some of the 
swampy land. 
It was never very deep, but mushy and slippery. 
Ended up 
in her sister Emily's backyard, which her husband 
(Frank?) keeps more cleared than the Zimmers do. They also have a 
swimming pool, some wind chimes, a couple of magnificent holly 
trees. 
Samuelson--83 Fieldnotes 
page 87 
Most of the woods walk is on tape, PFP83—ASS007-008. Mrs. Zimmer 
kept collecting examples of various plants she was identifying. 
We sat down later and sorted through them and labelled the ones I 
wasn't familiar with so that they can be keyed into the 
conversation. 
After the walk we sat down to a great lunch, made even better 
because the walk had really whetted our appetites. There was a 
boiled ham (cooked with cloves 
in the water) and glazed with a 
jam—like tomato sauce. There was potato and macaroni salad and a 
late tomato from their garden. Hot sauerkraut which she had 
started to make on our last visit there. Beverages were water and 
hot tea, although Mr. Z offered to make iced tea. Dessert was the 
delicious "doughnuts" (her word) that were talked about at our 
last visit, called fastnacht. They are roughly triangular in 
shape, made from a yeast dough (made with rendered chicken fat) 
with some nutmeg and orange rind, fried in Caruso (a blended) oil 
for several minutes, enough to brown them and puff them on either 
side. Don't want to get the oil too hot or they will brown before 
they are cooked all 
the way through. The inside 
is supposed to be 
fluffy, not doughy. She put the cooked ones in a paper bag with 
brown sugar, several at a time, and tossed them to cover. They 
were absolutely delicious. She indicated that her grandchildren 
really like them too, joked that they would've come over to trick 
or treat on Halloween if 
she had made them. 
After lunch, Mrs. Z and I sorted through the plants collected on 
the walk while Elaine started to sketch the yard. Mrs. Z made a 
great little Christmasy decoration of princess pine, tied with a 
green ribbon and with a little candy cane tied it, 
the cane still 
in 
its cellophane wrapper. 
We walked through the garden, with the Zimmers giving the names 
of the various plants and trees, pointing out interesting manmade 
aspects of the garden (old outhouse, terraced area around a 
birdhouse), with Elaine filling in the information on her 
diagram. It started to rain quite heavily. I was taking pictures 
so don't know how much was getting on the lens of the camera but 
I just kept shooting, trying to finish. We had wanted to do this 
on the first visit and then had to reschedule it from last week. 
Knew this was our last chance, we really had to get this stuff. 
Back inside we packed up. Mrs. Z gave us a couple of grapevine 
wreaths she had made and some sea lavendar and bittersweet to go 
on them. She had wanted to complete them for us but hadn't had 
the time. Needless to say, we were thrilled with them. She also 
gave us a bag full of doughnuts to take back. 
It was sort of hard to say goodbye. I may be up 
in NJ again for 
some visits but who knows when or 
if Elaine will get back. The 
Zimmers have been so incredibly kind to us, 
so open. They really 
enjoyed having us. When a good relationship develops like that 
during fieldwork it 
is difficult to wrap things up. But we hope 
Samuelson--83 Fieldnotes 
page 88 
to continue sending them courtesy prints and Christmas cards, 
etc. 
So, what have I learned from the Zimmers? They don't depend on 
the woods for a livelihood. It's not crucial economically since 
Mrs. Zimmer rarely sells her wreaths (which she makes from woods 
products) for personal profit. But I think the woods 
are an 
important source of psychological and/or spiritual strength. 
Walking in the woods 
is extremely important, for exercise, 
refreshment, renewal. They are at ease, roam freely over the 
relatives' ground. I had the feeling that it was "all 
in the 
family." 
Mrs. Z was really great at looking for specific things. She knew 
right where the sphagnum moss or princess pine was, just the 
right, perfect cluster to show off. She wanted to find good 
specimens for us. 
Further on 
in our walk, when we got more towards her brother's 
land (e.g., the sand pit) or her parents (now her sister's) house 
with the remains of Ted's furnace, I thought Mrs. Z seemed 
incredibly at ease with the land. She strolled through cleared 
areas and briar patches alike, as 
if 
it where her own 
living 
room. Mr. Z too was very casual about the whole thing. This land 
is extremely familiar to them. They know what's here, what's 
going on

TX01: Elaine, Carl Fleischhauer and I went to visit the Putiris in 
G—Elwood; 12GT. What was supposed to be just a quick 1—hour stop to 
watch Ralph make a grave blanket ended up being a terrific 7—hour 
visit. 
We arrived about 9:10 a. 
m. 
and sat around the kitchen table for 
over an hour, drinking coffee, eating coffee cake, and talking. 
For a while it was Sal 
Jr. who was playing host, then Sal Sr., 
and finally Ralph. One of their cousins, a man named Charlie, 
also came 
in. 
He was very quiet for a while because by that point 
the tape recorder was set up and no one really explained what we 
doing. But eventually he started contributing to the 
conversation. He 
is an out—of—work construction worker 
temporarily employed by a bakery but also works making grave 
blankets for Ralph at $1 a piece. 
We talked about wine—making. The Putiris don't make their own 
anymore, say it's cheaper to buy 
it, but some relatives do so. 
Various foods items were discussed. Sal Sr. says he's eaten a lot 
of things, almost everything there is to eat. Squid--likes it 
with gravy (tomato sauce) and peas. He and his brother used to 
trap muskrat, sold the fur, ate the meat. A black muskrat pelt 
would fetch $5. They also used to sell 
rabbits and Sal. Sr. told 
an amusing story of how he won a rabbit at a movie once. Just 
what he needed when he was raising all 
these others at home! His 
family also used to consume possum and raccoon. It had to be 
cooked on a spit because it was so greasy. Sal has eaten 
blackbirds 
and sparrows. "It was a way of 
life then." His mother 
used to bake the birds into a pie. 
Sal Sr. was really interested in talking about food and the 
variety of things that can be eaten. He focused obliquely, I 
think, on how people were less picky in the old days. He said, 
"You'd have to eat or you'd starve," meaning you didn't have much 
choice, you just ate what was there. 
Sal 
Jr. mentioned a restaurant/bar called Champagne Charlie's 
that used to serve only wild meat. It was nearby, 
in the 
Samuelson--83 Fieldnotes 
page 90 
Hammonton area, but no 
longer in existence and no one could 
remember the proprietor's name. This brought up the question of 
game and hunting. The Putiris are aware of 
local practices of 
creating deer piles--food set out for deers to attract them to 
people who want to watch them. 
We again heard about a custom to detect whether wild mushrooms 
are safe or not. (This 
is also on the tape made at an earlier 
interview.) A silver quarter or a piece of garlic are thrown into 
the mushroom as they are cooking. If the quarter tarnishes or the 
garlic turns black, throw the mushrooms out. The best time to 
pick mushrooms is after the first good rain 
in the autumn, 
especially in areas with soft soil. 
Dandelion leaves are picked 
picked in the spring and stored in the freezer. Cooked, they make 
a good spring tonic. The dandelion flowers are used for wine— 
making. Vineland is a big area for this kind of activity. 
Sal 
Sr. had a great time talking about something called abolenta, 
which 
is similar to polenta, the Italian cornmeal mush dish. But 
abolenta just starts out with the cornmeal mush base. He has seen 
some family members spread it out to about a 1/2 inch thickness 
directly on the top of a table. It 
is covered with tomato sauce, 
little balls of hamburger, small pieces of sausage, mushrooms. 
Each person at the table would carve or trace out the section of 
abolenta in front of them and would eat away. This was especially 
popular in families with large numbers of children. Sal said, 
"All I know is 
it was good." The dish was very popular in 
Italy 
too, which he referred to as "the other side" (of the Atlantic). 
The conversation then shifted to a discussion of 
immigration and 
how the descendants of 
immigrants lost many customs. In Sal's 
family the boys learned Italian from the parents (or 
grandparents? It was unclear.) but the girls didn't. Something 
came up about the grandfather (who knew Italian) dying before the 
girls were born. 
At this point this conversation shifted to the "real" reason for 
our visit, the cemetery blankets and such. Sal Sr. started 
talking about crosses made of cedar slabs which are decorated 
with evergreens and artificial flowers and he went out to get 
some slabs to show us what they were like. 
At about this point Carl had taken the recording equipment from 
the car and set up the Nagra in the kitchen (PFP83—RET029-030). 
We continued talking in there, 
including discussion of Sal Sr.'s 
wedding. He pulled out his wedding photo album and Carl 
took some 
of the pictures outside to be photographed. 
Next Ralph, Elaine, Carl and I got in the car and drove over to 
Moss Mill Rd. to find the Amatol ruins that Ralph and Elaine had 
explored on Tuesday. We tromped around 
in the forest for about 
half an hour. The ruins were really interesting, all 
that's left 
of a big ammunitions plants built during World War I We taped 
this too as much as possible on a cassette; 
it would be whatever 
Samuelson--83 Fieldnotes 
page 31 
Elaine's last PFP83—AET is. 
Finally we moved out to the greenhouse just east of the farm 
market's stand (see PFP83—RET030-031). Cousin Charlie was hard at 
work making grave blankets and their cousin Claude Angelo was 
also helping out. Claude would take a cedar slab approximately 12 
inches long and six inches wide. He would staple some chicken 
wire along one side, then pile sphagnum moss on 
it, fold over the 
chicken wire and staple it to the other side. This forms the base 
of the blanket. Piles of cut evergreens (looked like fir?) were 
already on the tables. Ralph and Charlie would select branches, 
trim them slightly and jab them into the moss base. It looked as 
though wider, bigger branches were inserted first and then 
smaller ones on the top layers. Emphasis was placed on not 
getting too much waste from the trimming process. Charlie kept a 
tally of the blankets as he completed them, to be paid, I assume, 
at the end of the day. The evergreens would then be decorated 
anyway the customer desires. They are sold undecorated to 
florists and also decorated and sold by the Putiris at their 
market and on special order. 
Sal. Sr. showed how the cedar crosses for grave decorations were 
made and decorated. A similar process was followed by making a 
rough box out of cedar slabs into which was placed some florist— 
style green foam (not moss). The item was decorated again with 
evergreen and other "live" plants (such as ruskus), artificial 
plants, shiny red ribbon bows, and seasonal 
items such as 
reindeer (painted gold), plastic Merry Christmas signs, candy 
canes, gifts, etc. Sal Sr. made one of this from start to finish 
The process was taped and photographed and included lots of 
commentary from Ralph on what he father was doing or not doing. 
Lots of comments on their personal aesthetics of what makes a 
good grave blanket, cross or decoration. 
About 1 P. 
M. We went to lunch at the Columbia II diner, just a 
few or two west of the Putiris place. Sal, Ralph, Elaine, Carl 
and I had a huge lunch of antipasto (spelled antiposto on the 
menu), fried mushrooms with a tomato—y sauce, bread, and various 
entrees (veal parmigiana, cheesesteak, club sandwich). The 
menfolk had beers, Elaine and I soft drinks and coffee. Of course 
the Putiris knew the owner, Dominic (Elaine and Carl should have 
his 
last name 
in their notes.) and the waitresses. Dominic sat 
down with us several times to talk. He had lots to say about the 
Pinelands Commission, including an interesting explanation of why 
it was created. He has heard that people in northern New Jersey 
were afraid that southern Jersey was getting too populated, 
especially the area between Philadelphia and Atlantic City. Such 
growth might mean a power shift away from northern part of the 
state so they pushed for this reserve concept, knowing it would 
limit growth and thus preserve their power base. I found this a 
very interesting explanation, especially as Carl had been asking 
me the night before about why the reserve extended so far south, 
so far beyond the boundaries of the woods or what people 
Samuelson--83 Fieldnotes 
page 92 
considered the pine barrens area. 
Dominic also talked about trips to Italy by Italian-Americans. He 
brought out a great picture of a tour group he travelled with in 
Italy. The group, mainly people from the Hammonton area, I think, 
were sitting on the steps of the abbey at Monte Casino 
in 
Italy, 
the site of a major World War II battle. 
After lunch we went back to the Putiris' house, taking some 
pictures of the yard and chatting a bit more. 
In the kitchen was 
Tom Caucci (sp?), Ralph's uncle. (Think he 
is married to Ralph's 
mother's sister.) He was a very dapper, charming gentleman, was 
drinking wine with Sal 
Jr. when we arrived. It was his family, 
when he was a child, who Sal Sr. was referring to when describing 
the abolenta mentioned above.

TXO1: I am writing this on 03/16/84. While editing my fieldnotes 
I noticed no entries for the 
last few days of the project and I 
know that on November 19, 
1983, I did visit several cemeteries. 
The first one was the G—Egg Harbor City Cemetery; 05GT. It is on 
Route 561 or 561 alternate, just to the west of Route 563. I was 
interested 
in seeing what is was like because someone told me 
that colored glass was used on the graves since grass had a hard 
time growing 
in 
the sandy soil. Sure enough, many graves were 
covered with green glass (perhaps quite plentiful from the old 
glass factories before they closed down) and also with white 
shiny pebbles. This type of covering was found mainly in the 
older part of the cemetery, on both German and Italian graves. I 
didn't really make much notice of what the spatial 
layout of the 
graves was 
in terms of ethnicity although it 
is possible that the 
Germans would be more in the middle and the Italians on the edges 
reflecting the settlement of the region. I think it would be 
interesting to do more research on the interface between these 
two groups. 
The colored glass was quite attractive, especially when the 
sun hit it right and 
it really glistened. Another interesting 
form of grave decoration were clay markers, about 4 inches high, 
often rounded or scallopped or with a fleur de 
lys design. 
According to Bob Patterson, the head of the Pilgrim Academy in 
Egg Harbor City, the Germans used to paint this things silver and 
repainted them every year but the practice has died off. Some of 
the extant ones looked fairly fresh, some had peeling paint, and 
some where down to just the clay. There were variations 
in the 
ways they were used around the grave. On a rather large plot they 
were found only at the lower corners in an are that served to 
round off the corner with dirt between the pebble part and the 
cement that formed the square of the plot. 
In other places, where 
the only covering was sand rather than glass or pebbles, the clay 
things demarcated the entire grave. 
I took picture of all 
of this, plus other grave markers and 
decorations, including some Christmas grave blankets. Then I 
strolled over to the newer part of the cemetery. Here everything 
Samuelson--83 Fieldnotes 
page 94 
was covered with grass and carefully tended. I saw a few 
instances of a few of the clay markers being used, again in a 
sort of arc formation near the headstone. There were also several 
headstones with pictures of the deceased in them. Across the road 
was the newest portion of the cemetery with only a few graves in 
i 
t. 
TX02: The other cemetery I visited was 
in G—Lower Bank; 26GT over 
by the old Methodist church. Elaine and I had driven by there 
several times and I was intrigued by a grave I had seen 
in 
passing that was decorated with lots of bright figures. But the 
first thing I encountered was a large section of Cavileer graves. 
Eileen Homiller had mentioned that she had Cavileer relations so 
I knew they were a very old family 
in the area. 
I ambled over to the gaily decorated grave. It was a child's 
with a little white fence around it and numerous toy—like 
decorations--a plastic dog, bunny, bird. Nearby were the graves 
of two people (husband and wife I think) with brightly painted 
yard ornaments of elves positioned near the headstone. 
There were two graves covered with the green glass and white 
pebbles I saw at the Egg Harbor cemetery. Another was covered 
with a kind of bark but most of the others had only sandy slow or 
a very scrawny grass cover. 
TX03: Next I went out to Route 542 G—Lower Bank; 26GT where I had 
seen some great signs pointing out the "direction" to the Ben 
Franklin Bridge which crosses the Delaware River between Camden 
and Philadelphia. It 
is about 50 miles from Lower Bank. 
It 
is not 
terribly unusual to see signs like this all 
over south Jersey 
pointing in the most general way to the various Delaware River 
bridges.

TX01: I went back to visit the Putiris in G—Elwood; 12GT, 
especially to see what their stand was like at Christmas. Sal Jr. 
was just loading a truck as I arrived, preparing to take grave 
blankets and other decorations to florists and wholesalers. He 
commented that I had just missed seeing all 
of the blankets out 
along the stand. (That's what I get for stopping to get a Wendy's 
hamburger in Hammonton!) 
Sal Sr. came out in his bright orange parka and had Sal 
Jr. turn 
the truck around so I could take a picture of 
it 
in good light. 
He also pulled out a really good grave blanket and displayed it 
on the back of the truck. There really were quite a lot of 
decorations, a couple of hundred, I think. 
Next I went inside the greenhouse and met George and Pauline, two 
more friends that Ralph has hired to help make the decorations. 
Sal Sr. had a very fancy log (one of the bigger ones) which Ralph 
was also fooling with to "improve" 
it. He is always touching up 
his dad's creations; they have slightly different ideas of what 
is right. At first I was tempted to say that Sal 
goes for a more 
crowded and showy kind of display, but I have also seen Ralph add 
decorations that go along this line too. I think maybe they just 
like to 
inject a bit of themselves into the other's work, part of 
whole process of interaction in this family, always being very 
concerned and interested 
in what the others do. 
It may also have 
some elements of power play, one indicating to the other that 
their work needs improving, but their actions are so casual and 
accepted almost without quarrel (except for a little bit of 
almost ritualized bickering) that I kind of doubt this kind of 
interpretation. 
Ralph told me that they may not be able to make as many blankets 
this year because of a shortage of greens. They come from Canada 
and when it gets cold up there they stop cutting and the greens 
stop coming. 
The greenhouse was a lot more cluttered than it was the last time 
I was there. Boxes of decorations were strewn all 
along one

going out to the Egg Harbor City cemetery but Sal 
this one would be better because there weren't to 
in Egg Harbor. To anmd from the cemetery I saw se 
shops and farm markets displaying Christmas green 
later on as I drove along Rt. 
168 to the turnpike 
Bellmawr and such. I would really be interested i

side--gold balls, bows, plastic reindeer, little boxes made to 
look like gifts. They were also using green florists foam in 
addition to the sphagnum moss as bases, particularly for the 
smaller sprays/blankets. I asked Ralph 
if the smaller ones could 
be used as door decorations as Ray Dockstader (the deputy 
director of the Folklife Center) had asked me to bring back 
something for his door. Ralph said sure and proceeded to make me 
a gorgeous spray with greens, red ruskus, sliver painted laurel, 
a bright red bow and a pine cone. 
In front of the stand he was 
working on a larger, flocked spray and was also starting to think 
about one for his mother's grave. Sal Sr. had already been 
working on a large cedar cross for her, decorated with white, 
gold and red plastic poinsettias. Again, Ralph was tinkering with 
it, 
adding red bows at the top and ends of the cross (Pauline 
said that Josephine liked bows.) and adding little gold balls 
too. He was criticizing the length of the main piece of the 
cross, saying it would be too short when it was hammered into the 
ground and would look like a square cross instead of a more 
oblong one. After much discussion, Sal finally agreed and told 
Ralph he could add another piece to 
it to make it 
longer. 
TX02: After watching all 
this business with the decorations I 
decided I had better go out to a cemetery and take some pictures. 
I went out to the G—Oak Road Cemetery; 11GT, the one Ralph had 
taken Elaine and I on our first visit with him. There certainly

TX03: When I got back to the Putiris Ralph offered to take me to 
a hog butchering so we drove out to Joe Colache's, on 7th Ave. 
near Indian Cabin Rd. 
in G—Sweetwater; 12GT. On the way Ralph 
showed me a rather dilapidated old house that he would like to 
buy and fix up. Says 
if 
he could buy it for $20,000 and put 
$50,000 into 
it 
it would be a good deal. I asked him why he 
wasn't going to and he said he already had 
a house and something 
about "If I get married...." I got the impression that he was 
still mulling over working on this old house which really 
is 
quite impressive and could be quite nice 
if fixed up. 
Ralph told me a great story about Joe's last name, 
Colache. Said 
that Joe's father didn't want to be 
identified with what he 
thought was the negative image of Italian immigrants, so he 
changed his name from something that was similar but Italian 
Samuelson--$3 Fieldnotes 
page 97 
(like Cloce?) to the current name which Ralph says 
is Polish. I 
pointed out that Poles aren't all 
that respected either so 
it was 
an 
interesting choice and Ralph admitted I had a point there. 
At Joe's house there was a group of about 4 or 5 men who had been 
helping slaughter the pigs (one was still 
in 
its pen). Joe's son, 
Matthew, was also present. One of the men was labelled an 
"outsider," being from north Jersey, but when I asked these guys 
if they considered themselves Pineys they said no. They had been 
drinking and were having a great time. 
The carcasses had been partially butchered and were hanging from 
a pole suspended between two trees. Joe showed me the various 
parts--the ham, chops, shoulder--including some comments on what 
was called "pearl 
lard" which was very clean and had little to 
come out during rendering. Other parts, such as the legs/hams, 
had already been hacked off and were put in plastic garbage bags 
and were residing 
in a wheel barrow. At one point the carcasses 
fell down and the men hosed them off and then put them in 
the 
back of a van. They were going to 
leave them there overnight to 
cool down. This would make them easier to butcher. 
In a garbage can were the two pigs' heads. Joe hauled them out 
and pointed out where they had been shot in the head. Then he put 
both heads on the ground and placed empty beer cans and bottles 
around them and on their heads, then got all 
of the men to pose 
for a picture. 
It was a rowdy group but not threatening. They seemed to enjoy my 
being there and Joe invited me to come back and talk the next 
time I am 
in the area. 
TX04: As we were driving back Ralph had me drive up Indian Cabin 
Road to G—Moss Mill Road; 12GT to see some of the houses along the 
way. Along Moss Mill Rd. we also passed several houses that had 
Christmas greens, plain and decorated, out for sale. This must be 
some kind of cottage industry akin to the small produce stands 
that are out in the summer. There definitely has to be a demand 
for the decorations, not just for grave but for household use, 
and they must be fairly uncomplicated to make as many of supplies 
are found nearby--laurel, princess pine (which Ralph says has 
been hard to get), etc. Needs more investigation, that's for 
sure. 
I dropped Ralph off back at the farm market and headed for the 
turnpike, thence to Washington, a long way from the Pines.

TX01: Elaine and I came up to New Jersey yesterday for one last 
fieldwork fling before she goes back to Utah. It was not really 
doing fieldwork per se, more like visiting old friends, but we 
did take pictures and paid attention to what was going on. 
We started out about 10:15 A.M. from Rita Moonsammy's house 
in Mt. Laurel, stopping first to pick up some cough medicine for 
me as I was feeling really crummy with a cold. I was a little 
worried about exposing people to my germs and debated whether or 
not to participate in the trip. By the time we got to Hammonton 
though the medicine was working and I felt better. 
Our first stop with the Zimmers G—Devonshire; 12GT G—Heidelberg 
Avenue; 12GT. 
It took us longer than anticipated to get there 
because we got lost a few times 
We felt kind of funny about that 
because we used to know the way so well. We chatted with Helen 
and George 
in their living room for a few minutes and gave them a 
framed Polish paper cut we had selected from the Library's sales 
shop. Then we tackled the task of measuring their yard. I was 
mainly the assistant as Elaine knew what kinds of things she 
wanted and I also chatted with Mr. Z a lot as we were going about 
the procedure. He talked a lot about the garden, particularly how 
pine mice had eaten the roots of some of the plants. Not much had 
been planted or had sprouted yet as there was still some danger 
of frost. There was a nice big clump of rhubarb, some dill, 
chives, green onions. Several new noisemakers had been added to 
scare 
birds. These were quite interesting. One was made from 
aluminum Coke cans that had been cut into strips and fanned out 
into a circular shape like a whirligig. (2 more were in the 
backyard.) The other was longer and noisier and rectangular. 
After we had measured about half the yard Mrs. Z called us 
in for lunch. She had made a delicious cream of asparagus soup 
with fresh parsley and some homemade rolls (with chicken fat 
which gave them a lovely yellow color). There was also a sweet 
rhubarb sauce and a coffeecake for dessert, plus iced tea to 
drink. She showed us some dandelion wine that she had started to 
ferment; said it takes about 12 days to finish, 
less

cold and the kitchen stove is on making that area warmer. The 
weather this particular day was 
marvelously clear, warm and 
sunny. foodways 
Mr. Z. had to 
leave to go to a deacons meeting at church. We 
asked him to say hello to Rev. Ruof for us. Elaine and I then 
resumed our yard measurements and Mrs. Z soon joined us. We took 
out the cameras and started clicking away to capture the yard in 
its spring array. Most of the flowers were up but not all 
of the 
trees had their leaves yet. Mrs. Z had planted a lot of pansies 
and seemed to really like them. We strolled over into her sister 
Emily's yard which we had seen last fall. It has grass much 
further back, a couple of small garden plots, and a swimming 
pool. 
Mrs. Z showed us George's "hotbed" an old window and frame 
sunk into the ground where he starts seedlings for the garden. 
The glass part can be open or closed in order to provide a kind 
of miniature greenhouse. We also passed the site of Cricket's 
(their dog's) doghouse; poor Cricket had heartworms and died just 
two months ago. 
We passed the swimming pool 
and headed down the paths into 
the more wooded part of the Zimmer's property. Mrs. Z kept 
showing Elaine various plants that were starting to bloom or 
leaf. I was more intent on taking pictures of the trees and sky, 
trying to capture something really "piney" which Carl had asked 
us to do. We spotted lots of fiddlehead ferns coming up and 
photographed them copiously before retracing our steps back to 
the house. 
The Zimmers have a rowboat or canoe upturned and on supports 
in the area between their house and shed. On 
it were pieces of 
wood that I asked about. George had been asked to cut down 
somebody's birch tree. It was an 
interesting shape and so he cut 
it 
into pieces crosswise. Mrs. Z gave each of us a piece, saying 
we could use 
it as a trivet or hotpad. 
TX02: 
We took our leave 
in mid-afternoon and headed down 
Heidelberg Avenue to the 561 Spur and the G-Egg Harbor City; 05GT 
Cemetery. We had passed it on one of our wrong turns on the way 
in and I noted the plethora of flowers that decorated the graves 
for Easter. We drove 
in and took a few shots. Mrs. Zimmer had 
told us about the different kinds of decoration at different 
times of the year: spring flowers at Easter, switch to geraniums 
at Memorial Day, chrysanthemums in the fall, and grave blankets 
at Christmas. 
Following the cemetery visit we headed to a frozen custard 
stand just east of Egg Harbor City on the White Horse Pike. 
TX03: Next we headed north on 563 to Weekstown and Green Bank and 
west on 541 to G-Batsto; 26GT. An old abandoned inn just north of 
the small 
lake north of Egg Harbor City had been restored and was 
open as a restaurant. Route 562 (?) which splits off of 563 to 
Samuelson--83 Fieldnotes 
page 100 
cross the Mullica at Lower Bank, was closed because the bridge 
was out. The water in the Mullica was really high. 
We went to Batsto because Elaine had never been there. We 
wandered around for a while. Only a few of the crafts 
demonstrators were present: a decoy carver, a potter (very 
disinterested), a chair caner. There were quite a few people 
around and the weather was nice but the main house and some of 
the other exhibits had not opened for the season yet. 
TX04: 
About 4 P. M. we headed for the Putiris G—Elwood; 12GT. As 
we were heading south on the road from Pleasant Mills to Elwood 
we saw an interesting hand—lettered sign on a tree. It read "No 
Dump on Amatol." Wondering what this was all about we stopped and 
took pictures, then asked the Putiris later. They said that 
Atlantic County wanted to put a big dump 
in the woods 
in back of 
their house, 
near the ruins of Amatol. 700 people in Mullica 
Township (pop. about 4000) turned out at a town meeting to 
protest it. 
It was not really clear how much the Pinelands 
Commission had control over it. The Putiris were really eager to 
get us to write letters. It seems to be just the sort of thing 
our research could address, for not only 
is the natural 
environment of the woods affected by such a decision but also the 
historical dimension (and there is an historical marker in the 
area) and the contemporary cultural component (e.g., hiking, 
gathering, children's play area). We really should discuss this 
with Mary and Alan before making any moves but it could be an 
interesting test case. 
The Putiris were glad to see us. Ralph and Sal Jr. welcomed 
us with open arms and quickly invited us to stay to dinner. 
(I 
had sent them a postcard a few days earlier to warn them of our 
impending visit.) Emma's Farm Market was gorgeous with lots of 
hanging baskets (impatience), bedding plants (pansies, 
marigolds), potted plants (azaleas, rhododendrons), saplings, 
bushes, and yard ornaments (wooden donkeys and carts, some 
plaster of we had seen last year). There was a white flower that 
Ralph knew only as candy top which he was putting in the donkey 
carts. The only local 
items 
of produce 
available were asparagus 
and potatoes but there were California strawberries and some 
citrus (grapefruit and oranges). Some of the home—canned goods 
Ralph had made last year were still there: applesauce, stewed 
tomatoes, along with honey, pickled onions and the like. 
While the light was still good we took lots of pictures then 
Ralph set us to work moving around some plants. When I gave him a 
hard time about rearranging some of what we had already done he 
laughed and admitted "I will probably change 
it again tomorrow." 
I told Elaine that I thought he tinkered with the layout of the 
market all 
the time. aesthetics 
Joe Colache arrived. He was the man whose hog butchering I 
went to 
last December with Ralph. Joe chastised me for not 
Samuelson--83 Fieldnotes 
page 101 
sending him photos and I said that I had but that they had gone 
to Ralph. (Ralph later found them and gave them to Joe who 
remarked on how clear they were.) Joe 
is working for Ralph to 
enclose the ends of the farm market to keep out the wind and 
rain. He 
is putting up an open framework and then will attach 
sheets of plastic. 
As 
it got dark Elaine and I moved inside while Sal Sr. went 
shopping and Ralph tended the market. Newly arrived visitors from 
Rocky Mount, Virginia were there, Anna and Bruno Marino. They are 
longtime friends of the family, former residents of Hammonton. 
She 
is 72 (?), he 
is 73. As we chatted with Anna (Bruno was 
asleep in the living room.) she told us first about their health. 
She 
is diabetic and has an enlarged heart. He just had quintuple 
heart bypass surgery and has emphysema. 
We talked with Anna for a good hour and a half as we 
sporadically worked on dinner and folded laundry. Anna was a 
close friend of the late Josephine Putiri. She is concerned for 
the boys, hopes they find good wives who will cook and clean and 
take care of them. Like many of the Putiris' other women friends 
she seemed to sweep into their life and set it 
in order, such as 
cooking and cleaning out the refrigerator. She had planned a meal 
of cooked asparagus and an asparagus omelet (lots of asparagus at 
this time of year; we had had 
it at Rita's the night before.). 
Sal 
decided that was not bountiful enough and brought back some 
ham slices from the store. 
Ann and Elaine had hulled 
strawberries which were served with Entenmann's pound cake, 
ice 
cream, and whipped cream. I cut up some tomatoes, cucumbers and 
radishes for a salad and Ralph popped some potatoes into the 
microwave. The result was a rather eclectic meal with everyone 
contributing something. Drinks included diet 7—Up, blackberry 
brandy, wine, water, and cider. The numbers of eaters was 
in flux 
too. Sal 
Jr. had a previous engagement and no one was sure 
if 
Floyd Bird (a cousin living there) would be around (he was not). 
Anna at first said she was not going to eat, and neither was 
Bruno, but then she changed her mind and when Bruno saw all 
the 
food and action going on he joined us too. Although he was not 
eating, Joe Colache was standing around the kitchen and chatting 
during much of the meal. foodways, family 
Ralph asked me to say grace. I felt somewhat tentative and 
uncomfortable and I am sure it was reflected in my voice. I said 
a quick little prayer I remembered from childhood: "God 
is great, 
God 
is good, 
let us thank him for this food." It seemed to 
satisfy. Anna told us 
that she was the impetus for Ralph's 
Christian conversion, or being born again. He changed first, 
followed by Sal 
Jr. 
(which I had not realized) and his mother. 
It was nearly 10 P.M. before dinner was over by which time 
Elaine and I felt we really had to hit the road 
in order to get 
back to Rita's before she went to bed. We felt rather guilty 
about leaving the dishes and all. Ralph had several presents for 
Samuelson--83 Fieldnotes 
page 102 
us, a jar of roasted red peppers, boxes of blooming forget—me— 
nots, a jug of cider, some small cacti 
in clay pots. (We had 
bought a larger one as a hostess gift for Rita.) It was rather 
sad for Elaine to 
leave as she really does not know if or when 
she will be back that way again. I promised to visit over the 
summer as I intend to document the Our Lady of Mt. Carmel 
festival 
in Hammonton in mid—July. 
We headed north, back to Mt. Laurel to give Rita a report 
and to discuss the day's work. It was great to be back 
in the 
field again and to see these people who have become good friends. 
Henry Glassie once told me that the surest antidote to depression 
was to do fieldwork and he was right. The malaise and stress I 
have felt in the last few weeks simply evaporated as I walked in 
the woods with Mrs. Zimmer or sat 
in the Putiris' kitchen. I 
really hope that I can keep heading back there periodically to 
keep 
in touch. It was nice to be back 
in the Pinelands again but 
felt so strange for it to be only one day. Even 
in a short time 
things have changed and I felt like much more of an outsider than 
when I was working there.
