Steve Bower Interview 
00:00:01  April 7, 2014, Ruth Olson in Waunakee, Wisconsin interviewing Steve Bower about 
teaching physics and other sciences at Waunakee High School.  Born in Toledo, Ohio in 1952. Very 
interested in the out-of-doors as a child, through high school. His high school guidance counselor 
advised him to go to college in Stevens Point, Wisconsin where they had a good program in wild 
life management and forestry. He went to Stevens Point in 1971, majoring in Forestry.  In early 
70s, professors were telling students there were no jobs in forestry, and even if they got a job 
they wouldn't be paid anything. Also, Steve was paying out-of-state tuition since he was from 
Ohio. So, he was interested in re-considering his career and also establishing in-state residency.  
Just into his sophomore year of college, he quit and worked in a paper mill near Stevens Point for 
a year and a half, established residency and decided to go into science education. 
00:03:05  Steve never imagined himself being a teacher, but his passion for the environment and 
science was lifelong, so he decided to give it a try. Seven years after beginning his bachelor's 
degree, he graduated from college.  He student taught at Stevens Point. His cooperating teacher 
there was very knowledgeable and knew what was going on--it is interesting to reflect on how 
much has changed since then.  Then, it was pretty much, memorize, vocabulary, study guides, an 
occasional reel-to-reel movie that they would show, and a lab every once in a while, so there 
wasn't a lot of imagination that went into it.  This was in 1978. 
00:04:40  Steve also has a Masters degree from UW-River Falls, which he completed in 1990.  He 
started teaching in 1980, in the same junior high he student taught in.  From 1980-83, he taught 
junior high, 8th and 9th grade Earth Science and Physical Science, and after those 3 years, he 
moved to Hudson where he taught 8th grade Earth Science. There, he collaborated with Jerry 
Larson, who really helped Steve understand Geology. He was a geologist.  Steve knew some 
astronomy. In Hudson they were interested in expanding the curriculum, and Steve thinks they 
hired him to help with that expansion of Earth Science. River Falls is just down the road from 
Hudson, and that's when he started his Masters. Was at Hudson for three years. 
00:06:10  After Steve was finished at Hudson, he was looking for a job closer to Madison because 
his wife wanted to move closer to her parents. Monroe had an Earth Science job available; Steve 
applied for that. His wife's brother was the assistant principal at Monroe High School, so that was 
fortuitous.  Steve started the job in Monroe in 1987. Each one of the changes Steve made really 
broadened the horizons of Steve's teaching. When he went to Monroe, two weeks before the 
school year started, the assistant principal called him and asked him to teach physics because the 
physics teacher had quit. Steve has a life license, which allows him to teach any science--1978 
was the last year that those were granted. Steve agreed to teach physics, and the next day went 
and looked at the textbook and the lab manual, and opened the cupboards and knew he was in 
trouble. The degree he got in Stevens Point was a little bit of everything. 56 credits t the time, the 
required courses gave him a smattering of everything, not expertise in anything.  So, in Monroe 
he taught Physics but also 4 sections of Earth Science.

00:08:40  He realized he had a lot of work ahead of him.  For the two weeks before school started, 
he pored over the textbook, found Physics resources, prepped labs, did everything he could, and 
the first year he was there, he was going 100 miles per hour every day, learning the material like 
he had never known it before "because if you teach the material, you really have to know it." That 
first year, he was one step ahead of the kids. Nobody else in the school had any Physics 
background. But things really took off from there--he realized he needed some professional 
development.  The federal government had Eisenhower funding, which was given to each of the 
school districts for math and science curriculum and training. So he was able to use that funding, 
plus university and National Science Foundation funding, and go to the University of Northern 
Iowa where there was a program called PRISMS--Physics Resources and Instructional Strategies 
for Motivating Students--run by Roy Unrue and Tim Cooney, two professors there. Steve went 
there in the summer of 1987, went back in summer 1988 and 1989. Two to three weeks, each 
summer. They went through the manual front to back the first year--it was a godsend and 
revelation to Steve. 
00:11:02  Dr. Cooney and Dr. Unrue had looked at student misconceptions, and wrote the PRISMS 
manual so that each unit started with questions that dealt with student misconceptions. Each unit 
started with exploration activities; often it was a lab, lasting about 5 minutes in the classroom. 
Then time was spent developing concepts--in other words, what's the physics behind this 
concept? Then, there would be application activities, to get the kids to apply the concepts. Just 
prior to an assessment or the application, Steve would hand back their responses to the 
exploration activity and the class would talk about what they thought.  It's called the Learning 
Cycle. 
00:14:00  How did Steve develop the concepts in the classroom:  "It's really the art of teaching. 
What do you use in order to get a point across to students? It's got to be age appropriate, that's 
really critical. And the PRISMS manual was designed specifically for high school students, and so 
the whole age-appropriateness of that was already done by Tim and Roy, they did that footwork 
prior to this."  Part of physics is the math. Mathematics is a language of physics, so you use that, 
and you conceptualize with the kids as well. This was way before Youtube and the Internet--there 
were videotapes Steve would get from TV, there were labs the kids would do, like in Newton's 
laws, they would pull, read forces, change mass and acceleration, and look at forces as well. 
00:15:55  One unit would certainly take more than an hour. Monroe had 50 minute periods. It 
would depend on the complexity of the unit and how deeply you wanted to get into it. Could be a 
week or two weeks, or three weeks, for Newton's Laws of Inertia, first law, second law, third law-
-the whole thing would be about 3 weeks to develop all three of Newton's Laws. Then if you
wanted to apply that to centrifugal force, you could do that--riding roller coasters and so forth.
That class met with Steve every day. Monroe had a 7-period day, then moved to an 8-period day
with shorter hours so that kids could take more classes. Steve was at Monroe for 12 years, about
1999.
00:17:15  The next place Steve taught was Waunakee, and he has been there 17 years. When 
Steve started at Waunakee, they had an 8-period day, and then moved to a block--which is a 90-
minute class period every other day.  Steve moved from Monroe to Waunakee because he had 
gotten re-married and his wife was teaching art in Columbus, so he moved closer to Columbus.

She then got a job in Sun Prairie and they lived there, which was an easy commute. A few years 
later, she was able to get an art job in Waunakee, so they are fortunate to be teaching in the same 
school. 
00:18:30  Explanation of Life Certificate. The Department of Public Instruction looks to revise its 
certification regularly. In the 1970s, you could take your Methods course, and then 56 hours 
worth of just about everything--geology, weather, physics, chemistry, astronomy--and that's what 
the DPI said constituted a life license. Anyone with a life license could teach any science. Steve 
learned how much you have to know in order to really teach something. Even with his teaching of 
Earth Science--his 6-9 credits in geology and 6-9 credits in physics just scratched the surface. And 
the physics classes were 10 years before teaching in Monroe, so you don't remember a whole lot! 
There are attributes and drawbacks to the life license. You really need to know your material, and 
the art of teaching then is how do you do the formative assessment and summative assessment 
and tie everything together. 
00:20:45  Each one of the moves--from Stevens Point to Hudson to Monroe to Waunakee--has 
been a shot in the arm professionally for Steve. He really needed to learn the material to a depth 
he hadn't before, and having those challenges made him do that. He really stepped up to the plate. 
He looked for professional development, and the Eisenhower and university funding made a lot 
possible. Teachers in the professional development would get paid $60/day, get graduate credits, 
stay at the university and have week-long workshops.  "That's why I stayed in teaching, and that 
has been absolutely instrumental--it is critical for my professional development, to have gone 
through that PRISMS material."  [bell rings] 
00:22:15  What's a typical day like at Waunakee High School?  Blocks are 90 minutes long, kids 
have 10 minutes passing time. School starts at 8:15 and is done at 3:25.  4 classes per day, with 
lunch hour scheduled in there as well. Steve meets with his physics students every other day, and 
he also teaches, depending on what is necessary.  geology, weather and climate, or astronomy, 
whatever is needed. So he's got Physics on the B days, and Weather and Climate on the A days, an 
every-other-day schedule.  The classes are 90 minutes, which is nice, because you can dedicate a 
lot of time to developing concepts.  When Steve was in Monroe, it seemed as if he was setting 
things up, then tearing them down, then setting them up, then tearing them down...a lot of the 
hour was devoted to just maintenance of various things, "the monkey work" of set up and tear 
down--so of that 50 minutes, really didn't have 50 minutes of teaching.  In Waunakee, he spends a 
little time setting up and tearing down between classes, but he is also fortunate in that he can just 
move from room to room; the kids aren't taking Physics and Weather and Climate in the same 
classroom. 
00:24:44  Steve arrives at school at 7:30 to 7:45 in the morning, depending on what is needed. 
Then he sticks around until 3:45 or 4:00. That's his school day.  He grades papers at home--this 
last weekend he was grading papers.  Steve doesn't know how you can keep up with things if you 
don't take stuff home to do.  "You'd just be taking shortcuts if you didn't do that. It's part of being 
a teacher."  The Weather and Climate class (as would be Geology or Astronomy courses) are 
sophomores to seniors.  The students who take those classes take the subject they are interested 
in--they are all electives.  The only required course in Waunakee is freshman Biology. The courses 
in Physics are elective. Steve doesn't teach freshman Biology; he taught biology his first year and 
Wisconsin Classroom Teachers

not since. There is a team of teachers who teach Biology, another group teaches the Earth 
Sciences, Steve team-teaches Physics with one other individual; [bell rings] it depends on the 
number of sections they have. 
00:27:10  Student body: roughly 1200 kids in the school, about 300 per class (freshman, 
sophomore, etc.).  In the science department, they have a cap of 24 per class, because of safety 
and activity. They are doing things every day, getting the kids up and moving around, doing 
science.  There are 9 teachers in the science department, and growing slowly. Waunakee is a 
growing community, so the school is adding maybe 60 kids per year, depending on the 
enrollment. It's open enrollment in Wisconsin; they do have kids coming to Waunakee school; it 
is a magnet school because they do things really well, and test scores reflect that. The school has a 
very professional staff--everyone, not just the science department. They do a bang-up job and 
have resources that really meet the needs of the kids. 
00:29:00  Steve has three sections of Physics on B days--1st hour, 2nd hour and 4th hour--and on 
A days he has two sections of Weather and Climate, and a Science Resource. They have a prep 
period each day, and Science Resource is designed to do that--if kids have questions, need quiet 
time or help in other sciences, they can come in and talk.  There are also Math Resources and 
Language Arts Resources as well, so we can send kids places if they need help. 
00:30:15 Does Steve have a favorite part of the day? "I'm a science geek. I just love this stuff. And, 
I really like both of my classes. And when I teach Geology, I love to do that."  In each of these 
courses, there are "ah-ha" moments with the kids. Those are powerful. Steve really enjoys turning 
them on to science. Steve tells them that when they leave at the end of the semester, he wants 
them to be scientifically literate, more than they were when they came into the classroom. Right 
now, instead of the "Explorations" he does formative assessments. So he asks them what they 
believe, prior to a unit, and then there is concept development, and then summative assessments 
which are labs, or he throws a test or quiz in as well, but often he asks them to write about things, 
to tell him what they have learned. 
00:31:50  Formative assessment, concept development, summative assessment--is a long way 
from Steve's experience in college, with memorization. "It is so far beyond the rote memorization 
that I learned when I was student teaching. And honestly, that is how I was taught. I remember 
that. And many of the people who come into the profession probably had those experiences. You 
know, it's 'sit and get' and rote memorization and that kind of thing. Now, we're getting further 
and further away from that. However, it's an easy way to teach. It's easy to look at vocabulary 
words, and let's just do this, and let's fill out this worksheet, and here's a Powerpoint, and I'm 
going to give you the slides and then you just fill in the blanks. That's nothing more than the study 
guides I gave the kids, and 'open your book.' Maybe it's a little bit more interactive. However, it's 
absolutely critical that we get the kids doing science everyday, particularly at the high school 
level."  Steve as the k-12 science coordinator struggles with seeing to it that the elementary kids 
get enough science instruction. 
00:33:20 Steve as the science coordinator goes to the Badger Conference, which is all the 
Madison-area schools, and every year he asks others if they have a k-12 science curriculum, and 
how much do the elementary school teachers teach, and it is slim to none, across the board. There 
Wisconsin Classroom Teachers 
 afc2013/017

are Foss kits that teachers can use to teach science, but from what Steve can see, Foss hasn't done 
their homework on formative assessments and more summative assessments; it's all that 
conceptual development cookbook kind of thing. There is a ton of information out there about 
age-appropriate formative assessments and summative assessments; the problem with teaching 
elementary is that elementary teachers have to be experts on everything. 
00:35:04 "And what's being tested--it just pains me to think that teaching has come to that, where 
teacher--educator effectiveness is getting to the point, 'Well, how did your kids do?' you know, 
'How did they score on the test?' And, principals are under a lot of pressure, superintendents are 
under a lot of pressure, teachers are under a lot of pressure..." Even if they are told that the test 
scores don't matter, it's baloney, because the scores are published in the newspaper and it's all 
online, which leads to comparison among school districts. It is critical to think about 
improvement, because they do need to think about how to become better, and how to make the 
craft more efficient, "but we can't do it driven by tests. We just can't. It's just shameful, in my 
opinion." 
00:36:40  The round of the school year. In Physics, and whatever the curriculum is, the stress 
points for the kids are where the unit summative assessments are, and the standard testing.  
Those stresses are periodic, depending on how big the unit is. The WKCE tests here in the state, 
given out by the state Department of Public Instruction, are in the fall of the year, and in the 
spring, the PLAN tests for freshmen and sophomores. In the high school, they have four days 
where they have a 2-hour late start for testing, and for the PLAN and ASPIRE tests, Steve thinks 
it's a 3-hour late start--so that is when they have testing at the high school. There is also testing at 
the middle and elementary school as well.  "But every day we test is one day we can't teach." We 
do need to understand where the kids are; Steve isn't trying to suggest that all testing is evil. But 
need to compare apples with apples--what's going on in Wisconsin, that is important. The 
acronyms: WKCE is Wisconsin Knowledge and Concept Exam.  ASPIRE and PLAN tests--Steve 
isn't sure what those acronyms are, but they are content areas. 
00:39:10  Staff meetings take place once a month. The principal gives them the agenda and 
handles those meetings. They take place before school, and last about half an hour. Covers the 
highlights, what's coming up, awards, recognizes people's achievements, and brings in experts to 
help them consider resources to meet district goals. Staff meetings are good. The principal is 
always open to others' ideas, and they can email him at any time. He runs the meetings. Steve is 
the k-12 science department chair, and all the department chairs have system-wide meetings; 
they meet once a month at the administrative center; the curriculum coordinator meets with the 
department chairs and they just run through the agenda; that is an hour and a half meeting. It is 
more of a district-wide initiative, about funding, text books and district goals. The system-wide 
meetings are a moment when chairs can learn and then come back  and disseminate information 
to their departments. 
00:41:32  Because Steve teaches science, he has a lot of equipment. Each department at the high 
school has a budget, and the science department has a budget. Further, each science team--the 
biology team, the earth science team, the physical science team, chemistry team, physics--each 
has their individual budget, which they spend as they see fit.  The computers are supplied, but for 
examples, the Physics team purchases a lot of the software that is specific to Physics. They also 
Wisconsin Classroom Teachers 
 afc2013/017

have 16 laptops and 8 desktop computers, so every kid can have their own computer when they 
want to do graphical analysis or something like that. Also, they have 8 desktop computer stations, 
where kids can gather in groups of three to collect data. Waunakee is very fortunate; when Steve 
goes to Badger Conference, he sees Waunakee is at the top of the heap when it comes to funding. 
Some school districts have next to nothing, and if they do have a budget, their textbooks come out 
of that. Waunakee has an IT department that comes in to take care of computers; all the 
computers are Windows-based. Steve uses a Mac at home, but the IT department finds it easiest 
to maintain one type of computer. They get updated about every 7 years.  
00:44:05  The laptops are on a cart, and they bring those in.  The Language Arts Department is on 
Chrome books, which are less expensive, but they do what they need to do, word processing.  IT 
makes the decisions about the computers, but the department and science teams make the 
decisions about all the other types of equipment. 
00:44:45  Steve doesn't eat lunch with other teachers; he works through his lunch, and has for 
years. Sometimes kids come in, Steve will be running labs and helping the kids out, may eat with 
the other Physics teacher or other earth science teachers during those labs. The teachers do have 
a lounge; there are small groups of people that sit around and eat lunch there. Who are Steve's 
allies when he needs them?  Steve's department pulls together when it comes to budget and help 
each other out.  Steve's principal has been an advocate from the get-go. He is superb; he should 
teach other principals how to operate. Steve has operated under a lot of principals and 
superintendents and has seen it all. Waunakee is a good place to work; a decent district for 
managing things. Have 3 elementary buildings--there have been some problems as far as science 
education is concerned, seeing to it that everyone is on the same page.  But it is a good district. If 
you look at the numbers--people vote with their feet, and they are coming to Waunakee. 
00:47:30  Do you think there is a stereotype of what a teacher is? Steve has reflected on that a lot 
the last few years. When he was growing up, if a teacher said "Steve did this..." to his parents, that 
was the end of the road. His parents believed what the teacher said, there was no doubt about it. 
That was still the case when Steve was in undergraduate school, teachers were respected. Steve 
thinks it's funny, that his forestry professors warned their students there wasn't a lot of money to 
be made in forestry--there isn't a lot of money to be made in teaching either. "It's always been an 
issue, I mean, it truly has. But you pour your heart and your soul into it, and I really believe most 
people believe that. They understand that teachers do exactly that. They're there because of the 
students. We do what we do because it's vital to the democracy. It's vital to the community. It's 
vital to their futures. It's vital to, you know, as I said before, being a scientifically literate human 
being. We're moving into things that we just don't get. We don't understand the whole thing, 
climate change, for instance, holy cow. And I try to get the point across, we need to look at the 
data. Not just an opinion. " 
00:49:45  How things have changed. In the 80s, teaching was nose to the grindstone, and people 
really respected teachers.  In the 90s, a lot of people complained that teachers cost society a lot of 
money, through property taxes.  It rankled Steve that some people would say to him, "It's time to 
pay my school taxes," implying that property tax was a burden and it's the teachers' fault.  People 
didn't say it was time to pay fire taxes, or road taxes, or police taxes--it's school taxes.

00:50:50  "Since 2010, teaching has changed 180 degrees. It saddens me--I'm ending my career, 
I'm retiring this year--it really saddens me that we as a profession have been vilified. We as a 
profession have been painted as union thugs, and all we're looking to do is get rich. 'Oh, you have 
a pension--well, let's take that away.' And I come back to, the fact of the matter is, I never--I never 
got into teaching to get rich. Never. Nobody does. Not a soul would ever look at teaching as a 
gravy job. Nobody would do this.  
00:51:40  Steve tells a story about one of his brightest students, who graduated 12 years ago.  He 
went on to get his degree in Physics, and then got a job at Madison West High School, one of the 
premiere schools.  This young man quit two years ago because his stomach was in knots, he 
couldn't take the stress. He said, 'I can't take what it means to be a teacher and live that lifestyle.' 
So he is working elsewhere. Occasionally, a graduating student will tell Steve that he or she is 
thinking about becoming a teacher--and these are really smart kids--and Steve tells them 'Good 
for you, but you won't get rich, and you might want to think about moving elsewhere.' One 
student was going to go to university in Minnesota, at Mankato State, and said she was thinking of 
becoming an elementary school teacher. Steve advised her to think about staying in Minnesota, 
because Wisconsin is not a place that respects teachers. It pains him to think that teachers have 
been blamed for so much of society's woes. 
00:53:25  "And one of the things that I am going to do after I retire is, I belong to Citizen 
Advocates for Public Education, and I am going to continue to advocate for public education, 
because it brings communities together rather than individual empowerment. And I don't see any 
reason why we shouldn't be working together as a community to educate our students, rather 
than individually 'I'm going here, I'm going there.' It's not going to help our small towns in 
northern Wisconsin, it's not going to help our small towns in southern Wisconsin and the divide-
and-conquer attitude that is pervasive at the state capitol right now is not doing anybody any 
favors." 
00:54:35 Do Steve's students think of him as an individual, or as that villain the teacher?  Good 
question, but not sure how to answer. "Kids are here because they know they need a quality 
education. They know that they are going to be competing when they leave high school. They may 
not know how, they may not know what the other kids are going to have, but they do understand, 
I think, that it's going to be a competitive environment out there. And so I don't know that that's 
changed that much. I've had a few students lately saying, you know, under their breath about a 
teacher, but not very many, just a few, just a few. At parent-teacher conferences, parents are very 
very supportive. This community has passed referendums. So clearly, there's something there. 
They understand that the community supports public education and that the community must 
support the teachers, the buildings, and everything that goes into it." 
00:56:00  How do you use local culture in your classroom?  If science teachers don't use local 
resources to their advantage, they are missing a key component. So, for example, kids drive. So 
Steve brings in a Dane County sheriff and he talks to the kids at the end of the year about his job, 
how he uses physics. He is an accident reconstruction police officer, so when there's a serious 
accident or fatality, they call him, and he figures out what was going on from the evidence. And it 
is really neat--the kids are riveted. Local geology--if we don't teach what's going on in the state of 
Wisconsin, because most of the kids are going to stay here, we are missing the boat.  When Steve 
Wisconsin Classroom Teachers

teaches Weather and Climate, he looks at the weather of the Upper Midwest.  He wants the kids to 
understand why we have the resources we do for farming, by understanding local geology and 
climate. "If we don't really look at some of those local influences, you know, in our teaching, I 
think we're just not using the resources to the best of our ability."
