Maoli 
 
In the beginning there was a voice 
and the voice was Maoli 
 
Singing from before 
the first footprint 
on our sands 
 
This Maoli was part of the original 
echo out of Po 
is our ancestor 
 
Before alii…before the priesthood 
even before the storytellers 
Maoli was heard 
telling the first stories 
singing the first songs 
and reading the stars for the first time 
 
Maoli…my brother…my sister…my father…my mother…my ancestors 
 
Before had england 
even before jesus 
There was a voice 
and the voice was Maoli
