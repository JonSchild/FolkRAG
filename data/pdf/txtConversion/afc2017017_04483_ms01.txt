00:00:39 KS: So tell me about where we are right now. 
00:00:44 GB: Used to be Swedenburg Winery. Came here with her husband when they were 
dating and then married. Was owed by Mr. and Mrs. Swedenburg. Discusses court case that 
Juanita Swedenburg fights to allow wineries to ship their wines out of state. Also discusses 
Juanita’s planting of Pinot Noir grapes in VA after being told she couldn’t grow them there.

00:02:15 GB “Her husband told us one time that they made the wines the way that they liked 
them, and if people didn’t buy them, they would drink them!” (KS cackles, comments on what a 
great attitude that is) 
00:02:30 KS So do you know anything about what their background was? 
00:02:46 GB Explain Swedenburgs were in State Department, had traveled extensively, loved 
wine, so planted a vineyard. Operating since 1986. 
#StateDepartment #travel 
00:02:52 KS “Wow, so it is one of the earlier ones for this area for sure.” 
Yes 
00:03:00 KS And they were retired when they opened it? 
Umm hmm (affirmative) 
00:03:08 KS So, 1986, they just came in… Do you know if they brought in consultants or 
anybody, or did they just kind of figure it out on their own? 
00:03:16 GB Doesn’t know, but says if they did they probably didn’t get good advice. (KS 
laughs) Explains only son and heir to Swedenburgs put winery on market after his mother’s 
death. David Greenhill riding down Route 50 and had been looking at other wineries. Owns 
SatCom Direct. Explains about his business, links to Airbus, ComSat. Greenhill hired Sebastian 
Marquet.

00:04:43 KS And so Sebastian does what?

00:04:45 GB He’s our winemaker. Describes his background at boarding school in France. Says 
KS should talk to him. He is their Chief Operating Officer as well as winemaker. Owns company 
called The Burgundy Experience with his wife, who is French-Canadian. Isabelle Truchon, an 
artist and interior designer, but has her Certified Specialist of Wine (CSW) designation. She also 
works in real estate, locating vineyards and selling them. She was first General Manager at 
Greenhill. She hired GB four years prior (2013). GB describes coming to work there part-time 
because she loves wine and food, a passion she shares with her husband. Traveled all over the 
world drinking wine and eating food.

00:07:05 KS Not a bad way to spend a life, huh? 
00:07:08 GB Trips to California. When she first started drinking wine in early 1970s there were 
no good California wines east of the Mississippi River. They were all the big jug wines. Used to 
enjoy coming out to wineries. Especially loved Meredyth Winery, founded by Archie Smith, Sr. 
He grew many varietals—about thirteen different types. Also in Middleburg. Discusses his 
newsletters, which predated the internet and email, so they really looked forward to them. Smith 
did barrel tastings and dinners, which GB and her husband attended. Discusses taking a niece 
there once, and niece named child Meredyth. Old ruins on site where you could picnic. 
#California #MeredythWinery #ArchieSmithSr #Middleburg #ArchieSmithJr #1970s 
00:09:34 KS Is Meredyth not there anymore? 
00:09:35 It’s there. They probably have some of the oldest Chardonnay grapes. Fruit is sold. 
Does not operate as a winery now. Explains Greenhill is Greenhill Winery and Vineyard. David 
Greenhill also purchased Naked Valley Vineyard in Amherst, VA, which is only a farm. Not a 
winery. All fruit sold. 
#Chardonnay #NakedValleyVineyard #Amherst 
00:10:25 GB “Right now, the problem with a lot of wineries is getting enough fruit.” 
00:10:39 KS So where is Naked Valley Vineyard? 
00:10:42 GB Amherst, Virginia. Vineyard has a family there as caretakers, but after harvest all 
fruit brought to Greenhill to become wine. Everything produced here. 
00:11:00 KS So, I know some of the other wineries will also sometimes—because there’s 
varieties that don’t grow well here, they’ll bring in from the west coast or something— 
00:11:11 GB “We are 100 percent authentically Virginia.” 
Okay 
Winery Workers in Virginia

“And that is part of our vision for this winery.” 
That it’s a Virginia 
Explains that everything here is done by hand. Sebastian employs own vineyard staff who pick, 
harvest, and produce. 
00:11:43 KS We saw some of the guys when we were driving up. They were picking the row 
that was close to the driveway. I don’t know what’s up there growing, but… 
00:11:53 GB Lists #Viognier #CabernetSauvignon #CabernetFranc #PetitVerdot 
00:12:01 KS And so what would you say are the signature grapes for Virginia wines? Obviously, 
Norton is a Virginia wine, but… 
#Norton 
00:12:11: GB Norton is the only one that is indigenous to Virginia. 
00:12:17 KS Do you grow any Norton here? People don’t love it. 
00:12:20 GB The biggest grower is up the street—Chrysalis. They have 44 acres of Norton. Says 
they have been around a long time—Kim should talk to them. 
#ChrysalisVineyards #Norton #Jenny 
00:12:41 KS So, primarily what kind of grapes are your signature grapes, I guess? 
00:12:46 GB “Okay, I’ll tell you everything we grow.” Savon Blanc, 1920s hybrid developed in 
Cognac. Parents an American and French grape, both obscure. (jokes about appropriateness of 
mixed parentage in America from KS) Pinot Noir. One of only VA wineries to grow it. A lot of 
Chardonnay. Riesling, which was part of the original offerings here planted by Swedenburgs. 
00:13:42 KS I do remember coming here maybe in the ‘90s when it was Swedenburg and having 
the Riesling here. 
Yes 
Says part of the thing that put her off VA wines was how sweet some of them were. 
00:13:59 GB Says all Greenhill wines are dry. Many people do not realized they are on the 
latitude of France. Part of the Middleburg AVA (American Viticultural Area). There are seven 
distinct grape-growing regions in VA. Middleburg includes 12 of 49 Loudon County vineyards 
and also includes ones like Slater Run in Upperville. 
#Middleburg #Upperville #AmericanViticulturalArea #LoudounCounty #SlaterRun 
00:14:33 KS I’m friends with Kiernan, actually. I interviewed her as well. 
00:14:37 GB Oh, they make some very good wines. Their winemaker is from Bordeaux. 
Winery Workers in Virginia

Yeah, she’s adorable, too. She’s this tiny little person. 
I know, but her wines are phenomenal. 
She’s good. Yeah, they won a big prize for their rosé this year. 
Well, their Bordeaux blends are… feel like you’re drinking a French wine. She’s really good. 
And she young! 
 
#Bordeaux #rosé #FrenchWine 
 
00:15:01 KS This is one of the things I quite like about Virginia wine is that there’s so many 
women like yourself 
Yes 
involved in every aspect of the production. There’s winemakers, there’s 
Mmm hmm (affirms) 
the managers, the owners, the tasting room staff, the event coordinators, the marketing people… 
There’s so many women involved in this. Why do you think that is? 
 
00:15:25 GB “Well, I think because women traditionally—I think—you know, like to entertain, 
so they’re interested in wine.” Discusses learning to cook watching Julia Child, cooking with her 
husband, pairing wines, hosting dinner parties, which she has done since the 1970s. Says you 
could get nice bottle of French wine back then for $3, though admits an apartment in North 
Arlington was only $150. 
 
#women #JuliaChild #DinnerParties #1970s 
 
00:15:38 GB “And I think people that are in this business—this is a passionate business… You 
have to have a passion for food and wine to stay—in order to work for a long period of time. 
Right now our staff—you know, the people in production—put in 80 to 100 hours a week.” 
Wow. 
“And that is passion.” Says this tasting room has only been open since January 10, 2017, 
references a smaller one nearby that is now a farm shop. Have 2300 club members nationwide. 
Attributes their success to their “incredible staff,” but also because the wine is good. Their wine 
knowledge is crucial to selling it. References a background in sales in a previous career (selling 
to architects, designers, engineers). Talks about difficult work conditions prior to building this 
new facility—working on the crush pad in the rain previously. 
 
00:18:18 KS Beautiful. So this just opened in January of 2017? 
 
00:18:23 GB Yeah. Discusses how the last facility was smaller and had only one bathroom, but 
says they became successful very quickly because of the quality of their wine and the quality of 
their staff… Calls it “phenomenal,” but says she doubts David Greenhill has made any money. 
 
00:18:51 GB “The saying in the wine business is, ‘If you want to make a million, start with 
ten.’” Talks about how much he has spent. Each French barrel is $1500 a piece, and they use 
only French barrels, which are regulated by the government. Have to come from one of five 
forests in France.

#barrels #FrenchBarrels #France 
00:19:26 KS And these are French oak? 
00:19:28 GB Affirms. Trees must be at last 80 years old. Dried naturally before cooper forms 
them. Barrels only contribute to the wine flavor for four years. Can be used afterward for storage 
up to ten years, but have to be careful about bacteria. 
 
#barrels #aging #cooper 
 
00:20:05 GB “A lot of people don’t realize how… You know, they think wineries are very 
glamorous, but they’re really not. They’re farms. You know, we’re a farm, and we’re part of the 
agriculture in Virginia. And it does provide—I think the last figure I got—almost 5000 jobs in 
the state, and tourism is… Year before last, I know, there were 1.5 million people who came to 
Virginia strictly to come to Virginia wineries. We’re now becoming a destination. So, that 
wasn’t the case she I first started coming here however many years ago.” 
 
00:21:00 KS But that’s part of the funny thing, I think, that is unique even compared to 
California… In Virginia, I think because maybe the population density is so big in the areas 
especially for Loudon and Fauquier County, that you get people coming almost every 
weekend… That’s their regular place… That’s their weekend happy place—to come to their 
favorite winery to hang out, see friends… You get to know—you have regulars. (GB affirms 
with “mmm hmm” and “yeah” all through Kim’s question) 
Yes, we do have regulars. 
So talk a little bit about that, because I think that’s really something quite unique. 
#LoudounCounty #FauquierCounty #California 
00:21:40 GB Been there almost four years. Some regulars have been coming that long. Says you 
really get to know you customers, and they become your friends. Says if she doesn’t see 
someone for a while—especially an older person—she gets concerned. References a sense of 
community… Says it’s almost like Cheers. They have people who stop by once a week. 
 
00:22:23 KS I feel like that’s quite unusual compared to Napa or Sonoma, where it’s people 
come from all over, but they’re coming for vacation… 
Right 
They maybe don’t have a relationship with the people there. And even if you’re coming from 
San Francisco it’s a significant distance to go. 
Yes, it definitely is. 
Whereas here… 
 
00:22:43 GB “Especially to get to some of the better ones because Napa… I last went with my 
another couple and my husband about ten years ago, and I won’t go back. 
Oh, really 
Because 31 years ago we made our first trip to the Napa area, and it was very much like Virginia 
is today. You know, a lot of farm wineries, boutique wineries… They kinda rolled up their 
Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017
6 
 
sidewalks at 5:00. We had to look—there was no French Laundry—I mean, we had to look all 
over the place. 
 
#FrenchLaundry #Napa 
 
00:23:18 KS Yeah, where do you get food? I mean, they have expanded that now… I think 
towns like Healdsburg, Sonoma have great restaurants, 
Yes, yes. 
walking, shops. 
 
#Healdsburg #Sonoma 
 
00:23:29 GB Agrees. But references a traffic jam in Yountville on her last trip, and she said 
“Forget it. I’m not coming back.” 
 
#Yountville 
 
00:23:37 KS Yeah. And it’s more spread out, too. I think here you can literally hit—in a very 
short distance you can hit five different wineries and not really even travel very far. 
 
00:23:50 GB Yeah, you can do that in Napa, too. 
Yeah, true, I guess. 
Says the better wineries there require reservations and appointments. Greenhill also takes them 
because it gets crazy on the weekends. 
 
00:24:09 KS Yeah, I can imagine… especially when we have great weather. Right now it’s fall. 
I’m looking out the window. It’s so beautiful. You can see the mountains, the grapes, the 
fields… It’s sunny. 
Yeah, it’s beautiful. 
It’s dry. I mean, this is the time of year. I wish more people would come to Virginia this time of 
year. I think they don’t realize how perfect it is. 
Oh, it’s beautiful. 
 
00:24:31 GB “Well, Virginia, I think, is probably my favorite state. It’s why I still live here. It 
has everything. You know, you can want the mountains, the ocean, the history, and you know, 
we have a building on this property that is pre-Revolutionary War. It was built in 1762.” For club 
members, built by George Washington’s nephew, who was first settler in Middleburg. Says Red 
Fox Inn can tell you a lot about it. Discusses a bit of its history. 
 
#RedFoxInn #GeorgeWashington #Middleburg #history 
 
00:25:37 KS It’s wild. Yeah. So you’ve got the beautiful scenery, the history, the accessibility of 
it for so many people… What are some of the concerns that you have for the future? You were 
saying Napa is—the traffic—Sonoma and those parts… Is that some of the concerns you have 
for the future of Virginia wine? 
Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017
7 
 
00:25:59 GB Doesn’t think that will be an issue. References VA’s strong history, which 
California doesn’t have. People will protect Virginia’s heritage. History as a protection. 
References wealth in the area, which is protective. People can come and get great wine and rich 
history in this area. 
 
00:27:46 KS We noticed on the way out that they’re building an Aldi though. There’s quite a lot 
of housing developments going in. 
Yes, there are. 
Are they planning to widen 50? What are they doing to compensate? 
 
00:27:58 GB Not sure, but they’re going to have to do something because of the traffic. But feels 
they are pretty protected in Middleburg. Also in Delaplane and Upperville. Horse area, which 
requires a lot of acreage 
Yeah, and money, to be honest. 
Yeah, and money. Discussion of Jackie Kennedy coming out to ride as First Lady, her role in 
building the local Catholic church so that she could have a place to worship. 
 
00:28:47 KS So I actually was married at Glen Ora farm, which is the property that the 
Kennedys used to rent for her to go riding. 
Uh huh 
It was just recently sold, but before it was sold they let me have my wedding there, so I have 
great memories and connections to this place for sure. 
 
00:29:15 (GB stops to interact with regular customers. KS explains her project to customer. 
Customer remarks that GB is a “genius at wine, but a wonderful person” too; expresses interest 
in project.) 
 
00:31:30 KS Well, see, there’s an example of your regulars who are so… And it’s a Thursday 
midday, and the place is starting to get hopping! I just want to point out that there’s people 
outside on the porch, 
Yes 
people coming up to the tasting room bar… I mean, this is a normal weekday 
Yes 
—two o’clock—and people are already showing up. Is that normal? 
Mmmhmm. It is. 
Really? I mean, who are these people? Retired people? 
 
00:32:00 GB Some are retired, some visiting. Says they opened same day as Salamander Resort. 
#SalamanderResort #equestrian 
00:32:09 KS Oh. So how has that affected things? 
 
00:32:11 GB People come from all over the world to stay there because it’s an equestrian resort, 
and many of those people join their wine club. “What’s not to love?” 
Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017
8 
 
00:32:29 KS Yeah. No, it’s quite tasty! [GB laughs] So, yeah, what do you think the impact— 
does Greenhill have a relationship with Salamander at all? 
 
00:32:41 GB Yes, they have relationships with several local wineries. Another thing their guests 
can do when tired of being equestrians. 
Right. Or getting spa treatments or whatever else they do. Yeah. 
All the other things that they do. 
 
00:33:02 KS So, do you ever have feedback from Salamander? Like, “We would love for you to 
create another bubbly”? Or? 
 
00:33:14 GB Yes, do get feedback. Have done wine dinners there. They wanted splits, which 
they started making, to put in guests’ rooms. Also a good size for airlines. 
Oh, yeah, easy to pack. 
And usually if you’re flying on a plane, you don’t drink a whole bottle by yourself. 
Right. Hopefully. Yeah, huh. 
Depends on the day! I’ve been known to do that some nights! 
#splits #airlines 
00:34:11 KS So what do you enjoy about this work? Because you’re retired… You’re not doing 
this out of financial necessity necessarily, but… What is it that you enjoy about it? 
 
00:34:32 GB Has worked since she was 15. Used to be a telephone operator for South Central 
Bell. Very hard to stop working if you’ve always worked. Doesn’t have to play golf anymore, 
but explains that you have to play golf if you are in sales, which was her career before 
retirement. Has always been passionate about food and wine, but also passionate about people, 
which was the key to her success in sales… So when she retired from sales, she put the two 
together. Went to work for Delaplane Cellars for Jim and Betsy Dolphin part-time. She heard 
that David Greenhill purchased this place, and Greenhill is closer to her home. Moved over when 
this opportunity came available. Worked by herself at first, but it became successful quickly, and 
the business grew. Says David Greenhill an excellent employer. She wouldn’t work there if she 
didn’t love his wine—has to believe in a product in order to sell it. 
 
#SouthCentralBell #work #sales #golf #DelaplaneCellars #JimDolphin #BetsyDolphin 
#DavidGreenhill #CrookedValley 
 
00:36:38 GB “If I didn’t love it, and if I didn’t love his wine, I wouldn’t be able to work here. I 
couldn’t sell wine that I wouldn’t drink because I have to believe in a product in order to sell it. 
And everything we produce here is really, really great wine. I’m proud to now be alive and see 
Virginia producing world-class wines. We’re starting to be recognized all over the world. What I 
love about Virginia that is different than California is that we make our wines in the Old World 
style to pair with foods… Because we don’t have the luxury of hot days and cool nights like they 
do in California, where we get all of our fruit and vegetables… They have a higher alcohol 
content, and I have a theory—and I think I’m right—that, you know, if you go to Europe, they 
don’t drink wine as a cocktail. It goes with their food. And our wines are very well balanced. 
Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017

You should be able to taste the terroir of your wine, and you can do that in Virginia. You can’t 
do that in California because they’re so fruit-forward, the alcohol content is higher… And I think 
that’s how wine bars and wine as a cocktail got started. A lot of their food—as a foodie—a lot of 
their wines are very difficult to pair with food. They overtake the food. 
Yeah. They’re too strong. 
Yeah. 
Too—too much flavor profile. 
Yeah. And being a foodie, I prefer Old World wines—in that style. I can taste the Virginia dirt, 
and I like that. You know, you should be able to identify if you get a wine from Italy, you know 
it’s from Italy. From France, you know it’s from France. Spain, Portugal—those places you taste 
the dirt, and I think that makes Virginia unique and very special in my—as a foodie. The wines 
are always balanced. You will never find Virginia wine at more than 14% alcohol 
Okay 
so it’s gonna pair with food.” 
 
#California #terroir #OldWorld #foodie #FoodPairing #Italy #France #Spain #Portugal 
#AlcoholContent 
 
00:39:34 KS Okay, yeah, I haven’t thought of it that way, but yeah. 
 
00:39:36 GB Explains that she likes to talk to people about food pairings, to make suggestions. 
People are looking for that information, she says, and this is part of the winery experience. They 
won’t come back otherwise. They can drink wine anywhere. Hunger for information from 
customers. Young people in particular want to learn. “It’s not just beer anymore.” Says 
businesspeople want to know about wine so that they can order wine for clients and appear 
knowledgeable. 
 
#WineryExperience 
 
00:40:47 KS You know, there are recent studies that have come out that say that Millennials are 
consuming more wine than any generation before them, and that the Washington, DC, area is one 
of the largest consumers of wine in the country—that we’re—we like our drinks in this area! 
(laughs) 
 
#WashingtonDC #Millennials 
 
00:41:08 GB This is a highly educated area, which contributes. Customers have traveled, been 
exposed, understand wine culture. Have been to Europe, understand more than previous 
generations. Affluence has contributed. 
 
#Travel #Exposure #Affluence 
 
00:41:33 KK I think you’re very right about people wanting the full experience. You know, you 
purchase your Blue Apron subscription, and then you purchase your wine club to go with it. 
 
#BlueApron 
Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017
10 
 
 
00:41:43 GB Agrees. Says if Blue Apron were smart, they’d pick up on that. People want to 
know—they want pairing suggestions—and she makes lots of recommendations to her 
customers. Discusses matching the weight of food with the weight of the wine. That’s a good 
start. Lighter wine for lighter food and vice versa. Sommeliers aren’t backing you into a corner 
like they used to. Recounts an experience at a high-end restaurant in New Orleans 25 years 
before that had been reviewed in Food & Wine magazine. Her husband wanted her to pick out 
the wine last night. The sommelier scolded her for what she picked out, saying it wouldn’t go 
with their meal. Husband defended her, saying GB had had this wine before, and that this was 
what he wanted to drink. Said they were shocked by sommelier’s reaction, and that this would be 
reflected in his tip. 
 
#Sommelier #NewOrleans #Food&WineMagazine 
 
00:44:05 KS Yikes. Yeah. Well, that’s an interesting thing. Actually, I’ve interviewed a 
sommelier as part of this—to talk and get that perspective as well—and I think maybe the bias 
towards California wines that we’ve traditionally seen—because sommeliers taste so much 
wine—and those California wines are very 
In your face. 
strong, in your face 
Aggressive. 
aggressive, and so maybe there’s something about the critics and tasters that taste a ton of wine 
are going to go for things that are a little more full-flavored because they’ve tasted so much. I 
don’t know—just a theory out there—but I do find that sometimes the sommeliers are kind of out 
of touch with what regular people would like because they’re just kind of chasing anything that 
tastes different. 
 
00:45:06 GB Yes. Well, sometimes—they good ones, though, should always make you feel 
comfortable. She never wants to make the customer feel they’re wrong. In their tastings, she 
doesn’t want to tell people what they should be tasting. Says we all have different palates, all like 
different things. Can’t assume what people will or should like. She explains how they should 
taste the wine, and then she lets them come up with their own description of the wine and 
whether they like it or not. It doesn’t matter what sommelier tastes or likes—they’re not the ones 
drinking the wine. 
 
00:46:16 KS So as a business, Greenhill is very flexible to allow you to interpret things as you 
will, other people to interpret…? 
Yes. 
So you’ve developed your own sort of sales—they don’t sit down and do a training with you 
Oh, no. 
and say, “You have to do it this way”? 
#Training 
00:46:36 GB No. There is a certain way you serve, and you have to give everyone at least three 
tastes. First taste shocks palate. Second taste you’re getting used to it. Third taste is the real taste, 
Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017
11 
 
so you have to give them enough wine to get there. “That’s why a lot of wineries you wind up 
wondering why you bought this wine.” 
Yes. 
They don’t give you enough of a pour to understand the wine. Talks about uncorking and 
decanting and the changes the wine goes through. 
 
#Tasting #Decanting 
 
00:47:45 KS So what kind of training did they do? Obviously you were pretty familiar with 
things, but— 
 
00:47:51 GB Trained her on Greenhill specifically—reference the employee handbook. They 
look for employees who already know about food and wine, but sometimes Greenhill has to 
teach them a bit. 
 
00:48:17 KS So when you bring people in like Eric, who’s a friend of mine who works here— 
Eric knew about wine. 
Yeah, he already knew about wine. 
That’s who we prefer. 
Do you just let them taste stuff? Do you just do a big tasting? 
Yeah. Uh huh. 
 
00:48:35 GB Before you’re hired, you do a tasting so you have an idea about the wine. They do 
periodic tastings for the staff, so it’s ongoing. She has the staff to her house for tastings. It’s fun 
to do. (Sebastian’s dog appears, some discussion of dog, hunting, eating what is hunted) 
 
#Dog #Hunting 
 
00:49:46 GB Says they also raise Charolais cattle at Greenhill, a breed from Burgundy, which 
was first brought to North America in the 1960s. Delicious, marbled meat. They sell the meat at 
their farm store. They also keep bees on site. 10 hives. David Greenhill’s father kept bees in 
Mount Olive, North Carolina. And they have polo ponies because David Greenhill rides and 
sponsors polo. He and the Mars family do a big polo match every year in October that benefits 
the National Sporting Library.

00:51:14 KS So what do they have at the farm store? They have honey, they have cattle… 
00:51:20 GB Cheeses, local things. People consign crafts—trays decorated with wine corks… 
So, sort of wine-related merch. 
Just, you know, local stuff. 
Right. 
Kind of like Cracker Barrel. You go have your breakfast, but you can look 
Right. In the little store. With the rockers. 
Yeah.

00:51:58 KS What do you think is unexpected about the work that you do here? What do you 
think people would be sort of surprised about? 
 
00:52:09 GB Does an actual “Grapes to Glass” tour that takes 1.5-2 hours. Explains winemaking. 
Go out into vineyard, explains trellis system, goes into barrel room, explains how barrels are 
made and toasted. Finishes at manor house on property with a tasting. 
 
#GrapesToGlass #Tour #Process 
 
00:53:10 KS Do you find that people are really interested in the process? Is that a big part of it? 
Yes. Yeah, I think they are. 
Because I notice with the tasting room you guys made a feature when they built this space of 
being able to look into the barrel room, being able to look at the machinery… and is that because 
you want to be transparent? 
 
00:53:29 GB Yes, I think people are interested. We’re very focused on our customer here. The 
authentic Virginia… “That’s something I’m very picky about. People get grapes from other 
states. As a Virginian, I do not frequent those wineries. That’s just my personal… Because I’m… 
You know, I think Virginians are very proud people.” 
Yeah. Sure. 
“We’re proud of our heritage and our state, and if I want California wine, I’ll go to Total Wine 
and buy it. When I’m in Virginia, I want Virginia wine that’s grown here and produced here.” 
#pride #heritage #California #authenticity 
 
00:54:18 KS Which is kind of a funny thing to even be able to say because, you know, for 30 
years, looking at this industry, there was a time where you couldn’t really say, “I’m only going to 
drink Virginia wine.” There wasn’t enough wine to even— 
 
00:54:32 GB “No, and some of it wasn’t very good.” Suggests that Kim talk to Jim Law at 
Lindens, who has been around a long time and is very well respected. (KS says she is hoping 
to.)Discusses history of his business. 
 
#JimLaw #LindenVineyards 
 
00:54:57 KS A lot of people have mentioned his name and given him credit for all of the help 
and support he’s given to starting 
Yeah. 
—fledgling wineries and things. 
He’s very dedicated. 
So it sounds like he’s sort of the godfather 
 
00:55:11 GB He is, yeah. Jim Dolphin knows him well, too. Jim and Betsy Dolphin used their 
own money to start that place. She’s a club member there. Says they are authentic also.

00:55:26 KS I actually did a lot of work in that region with the orchards—the different apple 
orchards and things that are there—in a previous project, so I passed by Delaplane Cellars every 
time driving out to my farms and stuff like that, so I’m very familiar with their setup. 
Yeah. 
Do you need to go check on anything? [referring to the larger tasting room and GB’s 
responsibilities; observes how busy it is; GB says everything okay] It’s a busy day here on a 
Thursday! So what do you think is the future with Virginia wine? 
 
00:56:05 GB "I think we’re going to be known for producing world-class wines that pair well 
with food… Because we’re already doing that here… And I think people will step up. There will 
be a flushing out of those who don’t produce quality wines—that are venues only. You know, 
it’s no different than California. Not every California wine is good. 
Right. Some of those will fall by the wayside. 
“And I think there’ll be more and more people seeking to come to Virginia to experience 
Virginia wines.” 
 
#California #WorldClassWines #FoodPairings 
 
00:56:56 KS What are, maybe, some risks associated with that? What are some of the problems 
that you maybe see? I know you guys recently changed to be 21 and over. 
 
00:57:09 GB The liability. The problem is not the children but the parents. We live in an entitled 
society. Says at almost 67 years old she has seen a lot of changes, and today the children run the 
household, and it’s shouldn’t be that way. Everybody needs discipline. 
 
#children #liability 
 
00:57:39 KS So what were some of the issues that you were having? 
 
00:57:42 GB “People just not watching their children.” Kids running out in the road, going onto 
neighbor’s property and letting the dog out, taking stones out of an antebellum stone wall and 
throwing them. 
 
00:58:11 KS That’s a funny dichotomy that people have here, is that the Virginia wine industry 
has become such a social aspect of people’s everyday life, and a lot of them are— 
 
00:58:23 GB “But I think you wouldn’t take your child to a bar…” 
Yeah 
“Why would you take them to a winery? I don’t understand that because I’m a grandmother and 
a mother, and if I couldn’t get a babysitter, we didn’t go out.” 
Yeah. 
They don’t offer anything but wine or water at Greenhill, so what is there for a child, really?

00:58:48 KS But there are other wineries where they offer kids a juice box when they come… 
 
00:58:52 GB Greenhill does not do that. They want to be about the wine—not a playground or a 
park. 
 
00:59:08 KS Do you think that’s an issue for the industry as a whole right now? 
 
00:59:12 GB Discussion of liability, something will happen, and it’s not going to be good. Some 
child is going to get hurt, and we don’t want to be that winery. 
 
00:59:33 KS So you’re totally in support of that change? 
Absolutely. 100%. 
You saw enough just working here that you were like, “Yep, they’re making the right choice.” 
 
00:59: 40 GB “No, it’s ridiculous. Some people thought that we were supposed to watch their 
children.” 
Yes. 
“I actually was—somebody was actually told that here. ‘That’s your job to watch my children.’ 
No, that’s not our job.” 
Wow, yeah. 
“So we’re on the cusp because we’re growing so fast.” Goes on to discuss that in the end it is a 
business. 
 
01:00:13 KS So it’s not just… I think that’s an important distinction about the Virginia 
wineries… Your view is part of the product. 
Yes. 
The setting is part of the product. 
 
01:00:26 GB Their motto is “Experience the authentic.” 
Okay. 
Asks how anyone is supposed to have a good experience and be focused on the wine if there are 
kids running around screaming. Says you can’t even shop for groceries in peace because kids are 
so wild. That is a change in recent years. References a mentality of entitlement again. 
 
01:01:15 KS Do you find that your workplace now is less stressful because of that change? 
Oh, yes, definitely. 
So it’s not only improved the experience for the customers, you feel like, but also for the staff? 
01:01:31 GB Customers agree that it was a good decision to ban kids. 
01:01:45 KS Yeah, I have to say, I don’t have children, so when I go to a place and it’s like 
Romper Room— 
You don’t want to be there. 
Yeah, it’s not really my favorite. 
I don’t want to either, and it’s not that I don’t love children. 
Yeah. But there should be spaces that are separate.

Yeah, correct. 
 
01:02:00 KS Is there any sort of special—obviously personality, being friendly—special tool that 
you bring to your job? 
 
01:02:08 GB Yes. Has had all of the personality tests—Meyers-Briggs. References her sales 
background and the personality fit for that. Confidence is important. Ideally, you want a sales 
personality, but that’s not always the case. Says they have all kinds of people there—a diverse 
crowd. 
 
01:02:50 KS I’m looking around right now. We have a group of young women who are together 
in sundresses. We have an older couple who look like they are retired or on vacation. We have 
your favorite customers who came up 
Yeah 
to say hi, and they have brought their elderly mother with them. 
Yes. 
And then we have a young couple out here—again, they could be traveling or on vacation or 
something. 
Yes. 
They look very relaxed. We have all sorts. 
And that’s how it is all the time. It’s a very diverse group of people. 
 
#diversity 
 
01:03:28 KS Do you have any pushback in the community for—when they did the buildout of 
the new tasting room or anything? In some places, like especially in Fauquier they’re quite 
protective, and they had limits on how late they could stay open, or what kind of events they 
could have— 
 
#FauquierCounty 
 
01:03:48 GB We haven’t really, but David Greenhill is very involved of the community. Attends 
United Methodist Church, supports restaurants. 
 
#DavidGreenhill #community #UnitedMethodistChurch #restaurants. 
 
01:04:10 KS Is there anything else that you want to add about your feelings about Virginia wine 
or this winery in particular? 
 
01:04:17 GB “I’m just happy that I lived long enough to see it.” She remembers on her first trip 
to Napa 31 years ago that there were retired people pouring wine, and she thought even then that 
that would be the best retirement job. She is grateful that she now gets to do that job herself. 
 
01:04:37 KS Thanks for setting up this whole industry just so that you could retire 
Yes!

and have something to do, right? [laughs] But it’s a great job. Talking to Eric, who’s very young, 
starting out, you know, single—well, dating, but not married yet—and starting out his career… 
It’s been a great supplemental income for him 
Yes. 
to be able to work here. He likes it. 
 
01:05:03 GB Says it’s good for her, too. Enjoys it. Keeps her young, active. Doesn’t need to join 
a gym. She likes the diverse group of people, being involved. Importance of being involved, 
even if you’re retired. Can’t retire from life. 
 
#Retirement 
 
01:05:42 KS Exactly. Kerry, did you have any questions that you wanted to ask. 
01:05:47 KK I think I’m good. This was very informative. 
(All go off to meet someone called James, and also to meet Sebastien. Recording ends)
