0208.29 teacher just let you have your way and don't get you, I (figure), I figure that they
not a very good teacher. And I don't think that a teacher should have pets in school. I
rather that they, that a teacher should be a teacher and get all of them when they do
something wrong. FW: <unintelligible text>. IN: (yes). FW: <unintelligible text> stand? IN:
Well, yes, I did. But more or less I think that as being a child I really don't think that they

0208.30 I don't really think that a teacher really is mean <unintelligible text>. I think they
are interested in the learning and if you learn, you won't have any trouble with them. FW:
<unintelligible text>. IN: Yes, they did. Oh, they would copy, if they think that you had
every good answer, oh, they would look over and like when we have our tests well, if they

read it, she was just very good. And she could work any problem. In <unintelligible text>, I
knew from that that she probably would end up being, a, you know, a teacher or something
one day because she was very good. FW: <unintelligible text>
0208.33 <unintelligible text>? IN: Well, uh, she would, <unintelligible text>. like stars and

he's very dumb, he's in Chicago now. And he <unintelligible text> wouldn't try. I don't think
he wanted to even try to learn. FW: <unintelligible text>? IN: Oh, just copies from every-
0208.34 body's paper, if he could, if he would let him. And wait 'til the last minute and then
he'd say, "did you get it." You <unintelligible text>, "did you get your work" and then "let me
see it." Then if you didn't let him see it, then he would get angry with you and want to fight.

different things that, uh, you know, different cases that people have and learning about the

would have gotten married as early as I did. I would, uh, try to go all the way through high
school and college, and I mean, I would try to make a better life, I think, and then get
married. In other words I would try to have more in <common?>, then start out with my
family. Then I would be more able to teach them. Because,
0208.42 the more I know then I think the more that they would know. FW: <unintelligible
text>... IN: I still would like to be a nurse, and I still plan to go back to school. FW:
<unintelligible text>? IN: Yeah, I still do, I mean, I haven't gave up yet. I still plan to go
