[talking about pottery sitting behind them and visible to the camera]...just between us so it doesn't look like it's 
coming out of our heads.  
 
MM  0:13   
Yes. Make sure no one has any silly hats or anything. 
 
RB  0:19   
We could bring our Halloween silly hats. 
 
MM  0:26   
So I'll start off. My name is Meredith McGriff, conducting the interview. Today is October first, 2018, so we 
remember when we listen to the recording. If you would each introduce yourselves, that will be great. 
 
RB  0:43   
Robert Blue, Woodstock, Illinois. 
 
SG  0:49   
And I am Susan Blue Galloway, also in Woodstock.  
 
MM  0:54   
And if one of you would tell us just a little bit about where we're sitting right now. 
 
RB  0:58   
Okay, this building was built probably in the 70s. And we moved to this location to set up our pottery studio and 
our house in 1982. When we first came here, the gallery upstairs that you see was more used for storage and there, 
the wall, the planks on the floor, had little air holes in them and the person who built this building, built 
everything with old barn wood. He would rip up old barns and bring over electrical, electrical stuff and he would 
bring over wood and he bring over everything and that's how he built the place. He built this place for two reasons 
that when he retired, he wanted to fix lawn mowers and so that's why he had a garage door downstairs. And that's 
what he did, as a kind of a hobby he would fix lawn mowers and small engine things. But he also made all the 
windows around the place because he had a garden, that was probably a half acre garden out there. And his wife 
loved canning, and they liked doing things, as a farmer. So they would can all their foods and stuff for the winter. 
And so they had two or three stoves down there. And she would be able to see out the windows as she was doing 
the canning and stuff. And so that's how this building was built.  
 
So, and then when we came the two of us dry-walled the place. And it looks like we were white all the time 
because of the plaster and the dust. And I'm surprised we stayed married after that. But we did. And after we did 
that, we opened the studio downstairs. And two years later, we opened the gallery up here. And then 10 years later 
we built the addition to the studio for the glaze room. 
 
MM  3:11   
So it might actually make sense to step back a little bit and talk about how you became interested in clay. Is there, 
someone who came first or would one of you like to go... 
 
RB  3:22   
I'll let you go first, for that this time. 
 
SG  3:26   
I had gone to DePaul University in Greencastle, Indiana with the intention of becoming an English and French 
teacher. Because teaching seemed polite and, I was the first person in my family to go to college. So they had high 
hopes for me until I said I wanted to become a potter. But I had studied under Richard Peeler, who had turned out 
was a big deal. He had been president of NCECA, the National Council of Education on Ceramic Arts and he had 
done films about potters in Japan and potters in the United States. He's very soft spoken man and he and his wife 
Marge were a great influence on me. 
 
So by the time I was a junior and I was contemplating a career in ceramics, my parents were quite upset that I had 
not known this two years later, they taken him out for coffee, and he and his wife ensured, were assuring my 
parents that they thought that I had the talent to go on. Went from there to graduate school at Wichita State 
University, got the job here and moved from Indiana to Illinois. I taught at McHenry County College for 33 years 
as their ceramics instructor and really, really, really enjoyed it, but retired at 57, so that I could be part of the 
studio. Our kids had left by then, we'd sent them off to college, and they tripped out, and have been working about 
half time in the studio ever since then.  
 
Oh, and I picked up another master of fine arts degree at Vermont college when I was in my 40s. So I'm "bam fam 
fa," BA MFA MFA. 
 
And I've just really always enjoyed clay. I have, because I had a craft class, done basket weaving and paper 
making and paper marbling and woodworking. I always come back to clay, because that's the one that's most 
fulfilling for me, and that's the one that I keep having new ideas for and that I get most interested in and stay most 
interested in. My family has reconciled to this. 
 
MM  5:46   
How about you, how did you get interested in clay? 
 
RB  5:48   
Oh, it was a fluke, it really was a fluke. When I was, when I finally got accepted to Northern, I wanted to be in art 
in some way or other. And I thought the best way to make a living at art was to be in advertising. Because then I 
could design things and I could use my art skills, but I could see I could also do the very practical things of 
designing, and furniture or, or packaging or whatever. So I went into the design department to get a degree. And 
after the first semester, I realized, and most of my friends who are in the arts, realized we had to do electives. And 
my roommate was also in advertising with me, which was another fluke. He said to me, I'll bet I can make better 
pottery than you can. And I said, "Okay, you're on." And we went into the pottery clay and I touched clay, and it 
was it. I didn't want to do design anymore. But I thought still practicality that I am, I wanted, I did the design 
thing. And I had two classes left before I could get my design degree. The head of the department came to me and 
said, you're no good at this, quit. And I said what? And so I started doing clay, and I've been happier ever since. I 
spent more time in the clay department in the clay room than I did in any of my other classes, so it was obvious 
that that was what I wanted to do.  
 
And, so then I went on to get my master's degree, still at Northern, both the bachelor's and master's degree at 
Northern. While I was working as a social worker and a craft therapist at Elton Mental Health Center. So for five 
years, I did that, while I was going through a master's degree. 
 
MM  7:44   
How did you get interested in doing that? 
 
RB  7:47   
I had to find a job. So I went in, and I interviewed with the head of the social work department. And I just, again, 
as a fluke said, I could also set up a craft department if you want. And she said okay, you're hired. So that's how 
that happened. 
 
And, when I first started doing clay, I realized you could sell the pieces. And that's how I put my way through 
college, by making as many pieces as I possibly could during the semesters, and then selling them over the 
summer so that I'd have enough money for the, at least the following semester, if not the following year. So I 
didn't have to have a part time job while I was in college. 
 
MM  8:38   
Did that start when you were in undergrad? 
 
RB  8:40   
Yes. Now where am I gong from there? So I was selling things through art fairs, but I actually started at art fairs 
when I was in high school, as a painter, because I did want to do art, even when I was 10 years old. And so I sold 
a couple of paintings and a couple of drawings at an art fair, in my hometown, back in the 60s. And I, I just, I 
liked the idea of being up in the, out in, talking to the public and selling my stuff so that it was a natural 
progression to go sell my pottery in art fairs over the summer to put my way through school. So for 48 years, I 
think I did art fairs, from the early 60s until 1999. 
 
And then in the year 1999 and 2000, I decided that it was better to hire people to do the things that I didn't want to 
do anymore, which was sell the pieces. So I went to a couple of wholesale shows and kind of, plethora of 
galleries. At one time I had 70 galleries that I was selling through. Now I have 28. And the places, the 28 that sell 
the most, I tell you they keep ordering stuff. This is nice. 
 
But I've been happier. I enjoyed doing the art fairs, but I now am really enjoying doing the wholesaling part of it. 
Because I don't have to concentrate on the selling part of it. I guess I can concentrate on making a lot more pottery 
than I can doing the art of business. 
 
MM  10:37   
Would you and I'm sorry to take you back over some things, but I think it would be nice to record, would you talk 
again about how your teacher felt when you were doing art fairs and what that response was? 
 
SG  10:48   
When you, when you... 
 
RB  10:50   
Oh. Because, because there's a lot of students and pottery to be fired, graduate students would did some of it, but 
the teacher had to do a lot of the firing because it was very, the gas kilns and stuff were quite sensitive and, uh, 
dangerous, I guess, is what you might call. So when I was doing a lot more pottery and being a production potter, 
he came to me after the third semester and said, you're gonna have to do a lot more firing, you're going to take 
over some of the graduate students' jobs because you're making too many pieces. And he so he was okay with 
that, because, you know, he saw that I was so interested in it, he was okay with that. But, it also, that that then 
forced me also to learn how to fire, much quicker, and felt very comfortable doing it. During the undergraduate 
school, I actually built a couple of kilns, both electric and gas kilns, which was fun to hear and see and do. And 
where else, what else? Can we get some other?  
 
MM  12:11   
Sure, no, that's great to hear about your educational experiences. Susan, did you ever do art fairs? 
 
SG  12:19   
Yes, I did for several years. But it was never something I enjoyed doing. So as soon as I could, I found galleries, 
and in fact, that's how we take vacations. We have some dear friends up in northern Wisconsin at Fire Mouth 
Pottery. Every year, we take our work up there, spend a couple days on the road and spend a couple of days with 
Bill and Kathy, giving them their inventory for the year. And then we meander our way back. When the southern 
Illinois gallery was open, the Illinois Artist Craftsman Gallery, we would go down to southern Illinois around 
Grand Lake, and that was a lot of fun. We saw the Lincoln Library because we delivered in Springfield to the 
Springfield Art Museum gallery there. So we have planned vacations around delivering to galleries. This is a lot 
more fun than being at art fairs. 
 
MM  13:21   
So how did the two of you meet? 
 
RB  13:23   
Oo, that's a good question. 
 
MM  13:25   
...grad schools and ended up here, so tell me about how that happened?  
 
SG  13:26   
I was teaching at McHenry County College when Bob approached me, he had gotten a grant to do a, an exhibition 
of clay art from, and craft from... he and four friends, I think. They had to have it in four different locations in the 
state in order to get the grant, so I promised them that they could have it at MCC. And after that we were 
instrumental in starting the Clay Workers Guild of Illinois. I was a founding member and Bob was one of our first 
joiners. And then after being in the guild for about a year or two, suddenly, we were neither one of us dating 
anybody else and ended up dating each other. When he called on about the third or fourth date and said, I can't go 
to the movies tonight. I said okay. And... 
 
RB  13:28   
I thought that was all over, because... 
 
SG  13:53   
Yeah, you could tell in his voice. He was he was not expecting any... 
 
RB  14:16   
Canceling a date, oh my... 
 
SG  14:27   
And I said, "What, what's up?" And he said, "Well, I'm firing." 
 
RB  14:40   
And I have a lot of plates in the kiln. 
 
SG  14:41   
No, you just said, "I'm firing and the kiln is real slow." And I said, "Oh, do you have a lot of plates in there, or 
shelves?" And he said, "Yes! Yes, I do." And I said "You know, they go slow for me sometimes. We'll catch the 
movie next week." And he said, "All right!" And Marge and Richard, the potters that mentored me and were my 
undergraduate instructors always shook their head and said, potters marry potters because no one else'd have us. 
And when they found out I was marrying a potter, they laughed. But it's worked out well, because I had teaching 
and we had the insurance and steady income. And Bob was able to have the studio here. And then when the kids 
came along, he was able to do a lot more with kids because of that. So we've always worked in, I think 
complimentary careers, both within the world of pottery, but not a lot of competition. Because it took both of us to 
balance it out. 
 
RB  15:45   
And being part of the Clay Workers Guild of Illinois was a really wonderful organization to be part of, and to 
have started it. That's another, we got a couple of grants through that, through the state of Illinois, because of 
some of the shows and exhibitions that we did early on in the 70s and 80s. Through the Clay Workers Guild. The 
Clay Workers Guild gave us an opportunity to not just show clay and do clay. But also give back to the 
community. So in other words, not only did, were we able to gather a bunch of pieces to have a show that would 
travel to junior colleges, or to have exhibitions that we could give awards to, and monetary awards to, not just 
ribbons but monetary awards to. That brought wonderful creative work to the northern Illinois, part of McHenry 
County College. 
 
But we were able to do Empty Bowls, where we could, you know, make a lot of bowls and give them away to for 
food pantries and stuff. 
 
SG  17:03   
And Potters for Peace, the Nicaraguan thing.  
 
RB  17:06   
Yes, exactly. And the workshops that Susan was, was instrumental in starting up a number of workshops through 
the guild. And 
 
SG  17:19   
The Clay Workers Guild, the pottery studio and the MCC Conference Center were able to go together and get 
some grants and sponsor workshops by famous potters, and we did that for about the last decade that I taught. 
 
RB  17:35   
But not just famous potters in the States, but Australia, Canada. 
 
SG  17:39   
Yes, we had Janet Mansfield, who did Ceramics Art and Perception, the Australian magazine, she came in, and 
we got John Glick to come in and do work, it was a big deal. Robin Hopper from Canada. Yeah. We had, we had 
a, Stephen Hill, between divorces. Tom and Elaine Coleman. We had potters who were very well known and were 
a draw, so we got a lot of people from surrounding states and it let the guild meet more potters and it also gave 
people a chance to see extremely well known, and extremely good, potters. And then I would take groups to 
NCECA every year. I think Tom has continued that tradition that he takes them to the Ohio show instead every 
year. So that we could expose the potters in the area and my students, to these artists, expose these artists to our 
area, and kind of spread pottery around so that people could see that it is a small community. 
 
RB  18:49   
But the Clay Workers Guild and having the workshops, and the workshops actually made money for the guild, 
which was, was able to have us afford to be able to do the shows and exhibitions and some of the teaching things 
that we wanted to spread it out to the community. Not just the potters in the community, but we had people who 
were just business people that were interested in seeing what the pottery and things was all about. Just to expose 
the community just as well as the potters in the community. So we were very proud to be part of Clay Workers 
Guild. 
 
SG  19:33   
With our cooperative equipment to, come together by five carts for the price of three or whatever, we would get 
them shipped to the local clay place or to MCC so we wouldn't have to pay shipping. So we did a lot of 
cooperative ventures in the early years.  
 
MM  19:51   
How many founding members did you have? 
 
SG  19:56   
Three, me and Lena and David. Lena Wells is the German-born potter who works on (?) road. She still pots. 
David Trumbull had a pottery in Richmond, Trumbull Pottery, for many, many, many, many years. In fact, they 
had a gallery upstairs where he sold mine and Bob's work. He has retired from that, he's in his 80s, he no longer 
does clay. But one of the big delights of my later years of teaching is that David decided he missed clay, and he 
came to me and he said, Would it be alright if I took your beginning class just to get back to clay? And so I had 
David, who was just the most amazing resource and so happy to be in pottery again, in in my beginning class, and 
he was a real senior statesman there. Then after he did that RB McAllister, who's a potter, was a potter at 
Woodstock, and then had done 20 years in real estate, said, you know, I'd like to come back to clay too. So 
suddenly, I had professional potters in my class, which was just a delight, because every time you see a different 
potter produce something in a different way, all of them have the things that they've learned in undergraduate 
school and graduate school and over the course of years of working in clay. And they were able to bring that and 
expose students to this. So that it was like having a little mini workshop. David had done a lot of extruding in his 
career. And I got to the point where somebody'd say, how do you... and if I saw them with extruding parts in their 
hands I'd go, go ask David, go ask David, he and he'd have, he actually made up a little booklet, and he hung it off 
the machine, and he was always thrilled to answer questions. So it was a lot of fun. So David and Lena, were 
already partners in the county when I came to work at MCC. But they came out to MCC to meet me, and then I 
worked with them, and it was wonderful to have that support in the community. So it was me and David and 
Lena. 
 
RB  22:04   
And then, on average there was probably 25 to 30 potters for many years. Now the guild has grown to almost 60, 
60 potters in the three surrounding counties to DeKalb County. Lake County and McHenry County. 
 
MM  22:24   
So do the students become guild members too? 
 
RB  22:27   
Many of them. 
 
SG  22:28   
Many of them did.  
 
RB  22:30   
and still do. In fact that's probably the majority of the guild, is students. 
 
MM  22:35   
Do many of them stay local, or do they tend to get on from here? 
 
RB  22:39   
Yeah, no, they stay local. Some of them are, have been in 30 years almost. 
 
SG  22:47   
Someone like Trish Vollkommer, who's president of the Clay Workers Guild now, started out needing a part time 
job and she worked for you. And through working for Bob, weighing out his clay and doing liner glazes and 
putting wax resistor on the bottom of stuff - this is interesting. And so then she ended out at MCC taking pottery. 
And she is now 30 years into her pottery career, is president of the Clay Workers Guild currently, helped put on 
many of the workshop and now negotiates and does some of the workshops for MCC. So yes, the people who 
stayed here have stayed effective in clay.  
 
MM  23:30   
That's wonderful.  
 
SG  23:31   
It is. 
 
RB  23:33   
In the early years when I was in undergraduate school. We would occasionally go to different artists, different 
potters studios and see the potters, how they work and stuff. But also, we noticed that many patterns would have 
this annual kiln opening sale, that they would have. So they will do a couple of kilns, they would put a bunch of 
pops in, in an area or on a picnic table or whatever. And then they would open up the kiln, and that weekend, 
people could take things out of the kiln, as well as buy the things that were out of the previous kilns. And so, in 
those younger years, I always wanted to do that kind of thing as well, but I was so busy doing art fairs, I never 
really had the ability to organize them for myself. But one of my neighbors here in Franklin, well in Woodstock, 
was a painter. And his wife was also a watercolorist. And they, when we first moved here, came to us and said, 
Boy, we sure would be interesting to have a show and, showing off the talents. But not just the talents of the 
artists that are in here, because there were three or four different artists up and down the street here. But also the 
people who refinish antiques, the farmers selling Indian corn and pumpkins, anybody that had a talent for 
anything, to just show it off. And so she organized 12 neighbors to do a show which we call Autumn Drive. And 
that has become my annual once a year kiln opening, only it's now, it's the Autumn Drive. It's a different thing 
than an art fair, because it's very eclectic, because some neighbors their talent is garage sale, but some neighbors 
are, they finish the most outstanding antiques that there are, and there's some very creative people that participate. 
So from those 12 people in there now 30 neighbors that participate in this once a year, third weekend of October, 
Autumn Drive, and that is our home show that we invite other artists to participate on our property. So we have a 
mini art fair here. And then some other people have mini craft fairs. And some other people have mini business 
fairs. And the farmers are selling Indian corn, pumpkins, and garage sales are, abound everywhere. And we 
almost get, probably, almost 12,000 people in the weekend, three to 4000 people a day coming to the show, it has 
now become a very popular thing its our 31st year. And it's become a destination for, not just people in the county 
areas, surrounding county areas. But we have had checks from Minnesota and Iowa, Indiana,  
 
SG  26:43   
Colorado 
 
RB  26:44   
Colorado, and people, people who just hear about it come, which is wonderful. 
 
So Fran, when Fran and I got together and did this with Henry Boyd who was the farmer. We never thought it was 
going to grow to that kind of a thing, but it has, and we are thrilled to have, doing that. So my dream had, did 
come true, in that I do have an annual kind of a kiln opening show every year, which is really nice. 
 
MM  27:17   
What kinds of other artists do you invite to come here, is it mostly local people? 
 
RB  27:23   
We have two other porters. We have two jewelers, a woodworker, a metal worker, and  
 
SG  27:30   
Honey, honey and gourds.  
 
RB  27:32   
Gourds, a gourd artist and a fiber artist. And then we give three or four booths to charities.  
 
SG  27:40   
Helping Paws is the biggest. 
 
RB  27:41   
Helping Paws is the one that we that we've been, is the most famous charity thing that we have here. And they 
have, they bring their pets out, they bring their cats and the dogs and everything, all the kids love to pet them. And 
it's a fun fun thing to do. And then they sell t shirts and sweatshirts and treats dog treats and stuff too to try to be a 
fundraiser for the shelter. And then 
 
SG  28:07   
And several adoptions have occurred because of them having the pets here, the puppies are a big magnet. 
 
MM  28:15   
That's wonderful.  
 
RB  28:16   
A bake sale for the dance group or the girls ... high school group and the Conservation District comes out and tells 
what they do. And we have had blood drives here before  
 
SG  28:30   
And the food Co Op.  
 
RB  28:31   
Food cart. So there's a whole bunch of different things that we have on our own property. And the advantage, 
another advantage of that is that right next door to us is a historical building called Perkins Hall. It was built in 
18...67 or something. This is Rick Wheeler (?). And it was a town hall meeting, and is now a historical building. 
And so the Historical Society owns it. And they now have a fundraiser there as well. So it helps, that show has 
helped them for fundraising. 
 
SG  29:11   
Yeah, I'd say popcorn guy is probably the most sought after guy at the entire fair. I, there's 30 stops, and each stop 
has up to a dozen people who are vendors at that stop. But this, the Wisconsin kettle corn is wonderful. And the 
scent of it fills the area. And it's been very successful. It's great. 
 
MM  29:37   
What fun. I had not heard anything about that. That's really exciting. 
 
RB  29:42   
Well you'll have to come.  
 
MM  29:43   
I will have to try, when is it?  
 
RB  29:45   
Third weekend of October, 18th, 19th, and 20th. I'll give you brochures. 
 
MM  29:50   
Please do. I'm actually out of, I'm going to New York.  
 
RB  29:54   
Oh darn. 
 
MM  29:54   
I know, this year. 
 
RB  29:56   
Well this is our 31st. 
 
MM  29:58   
Hopefully there will be a 32nd. Sounds great. So that's obviously that's a big event for you. Would you talk more 
about what your yearly routine was like when you were doing art fairs? 
 
RB  30:13   
Okay. Once I became, once I actually graduated and decided to do pottery full time, the best way for me to, to 
make a living was to go to art fairs and sell my work directly to the customer. And just any art fair would not do 
because if you went to an art fair, and you made a couple hundred dollars, that would work, you needed to make 
$1000 or $2000 a day, at an art fair. So I had to jury too many of the art fairs. And I have done an art fair and 
every state of the union except Alaska and Hawaii. 
 
In search of the perfect art fair. There never is such a thing, but there are many that are much better than others. 
And I would end up getting, there are probably they were probably in the 80s 90s and even at the beginning of the 
2000s, about 30 to 35 really good shows in the country. And I was able to get into 6 or 7 of those. I could never 
get in the same one ever twice in a row, or very seldom twice in a row. But I would get into at least 6 or 7 of the 
really good ones. And I would get into about 15 good shows. And I would end up doing about 10 shows that were 
just okay. So I would end up doing between 24 and 30 shows a year, which means I was out of town for 30 
weekends out of the year. 
 
Sometimes I would end up putting the trailer on the back of my van and carrying enough pottery so that I could do 
three shows in a row. So I will be gone for three weeks in a row. So I would do the show, the show would be a 
Friday, Saturday and Sunday show, so you'd set up on Thursday, do the show for the three days, take down on 
Sunday, rest on Monday, travel to the next show. It's kind of like a carnival. I was a carnie guy. But I did enjoy 
entertaining the public at the shows. And I really did enjoy going back to some of the same shows over and over 
again, because customers would always come back, which was really fun. And then when I would not get into a 
really good show, but then I would get in two years later, they'd, "you're back, oh, you're so, oh, thank you for 
being coming back." And so that was always fun to hear those kinds of comments that people liked my work 
enough that they would want to buy more of it later. And I did that for more than 40 years. 
 
SG  32:59   
And then after the end of the summer, you would start immediately producing and then we would produce your 
Christmas and all spring to get everything so that all of your stuff was in the garage. And sometime in mid May, 
he would load his trailer. And then each time he'd come back from an art fair, he'd have to unload the trailer, fill 
in the empty areas, and then reload the trailer. What we did not realize for many years is that spending a day 
loading the trailer, spending a day on the road, spending a day setting up for the show, being at the show for two 
or usually three days, having that Monday where everything just sags and then getting back here Tuesday in order 
to do it again. 
 
RB  33:44   
That didn't leave much time for pottery. 
 
SG  33:45   
Yeah. Well that, and it cut into whatever profitability there was because you're talking about days on the road with 
gas, with meals, with hotels, as well as the art fair fees. It was about 20 years ago, when we figured it all up on 
paper and realized, yes, shipping is actually more cost effective. Shipping and selling wholesale is more cost 
effective in the vast majority of cases than it is to do retail sales at art fairs, to say nothing of less wear and tear 
on, on Bob's back. 
 
RB  34:24   
At the very beginning in the 70s and 80s, when art fairs were the new thing. And everybody wanted to go to an art 
fair. And I mean, the general public wanted, wanted to go to an art fair and see the art and buy the art and support 
the artists. It was the hippie days. And people wanted to decorate their houses in that venue as opposed to just 
having plain walls, I guess. Art fairs were very popular. Then the people who ran the art fairs realized oh, gosh, 
we could make some money. So they doubled the art fair fees. And then the hotels in the areas that oh my gosh, 
we have a popular art fair, we're going to double our room rates. And it just, you know, then it became a business 
as opposed to a fun thing to do. And so that's why in the 90s, it started to not be as lucrative as it was, and you 
really had to find the really good shows or not do a show because you'd almost lose money if you went to a show 
that wasn't a really really good show that was juried by a museum or an arts organization. 
 
The local Chamber of Commerce did not do very well at promoting the good art here. And it was at that point that 
I realized that I was spending 50% or 60% of what I was making, to other people other than me. The hotels and 
the gas and the food and, and the promoters. And at that point, I said well, I might as well wholesale, if I'm gonna 
lose 50, 60%, I can wholesale and then the wholesalers would pay for the shipping. So I would actually make 
more money wholesaling at 50% off than I did actually doing art fairs. And I could make twice as many pots, 
because I wasn't gone so long, so on. So therefore that was a much more lucrative, and my accountant, when he 
saw me after the third year said, "Why didn't you think of that sooner?" I don't know! 
 
MM  36:40   
Did you do art fairs together? Did you sell your work together? Or? No?  
 
RB  36:44   
No.  
 
SG  36:45   
No.  
 
RB  36:46   
She did her own couple of shows a year. And, but mostly sold through shops, through galleries that she would do 
on consignment. I was, I was the art fair person. And it was very seldom that she would come with me unless I 
needed someone to actually help like, there were a couple of, couple of really good shows that we would do where 
I would be there selling the work, and she would have to be my gopher, going back and forth from the, from the 
truck to the booth. Because, take the dolly and bring back six boxes because six boxes were selling. Those were 
the fun shows. And those were the... but we when we had kids, she would stay home with the kids. 
 
We didn't bring the kids with the shows, to the shows with us very often. I started bringing Alex and Shannon 
with me to help with the shows. But then I realized Shannon was buying more jewelry, that was trading pottery 
for then... was worth her coming to the show 
 
SG  37:56   
She exceeded her minimum wage. 
 
RB  37:57   
Let's do that. 
 
MM  38:02   
She was having a good time. 
 
RB  38:03   
Well, she was, I was happy to have her there. 
 
SG  38:05   
And she got some beautiful handmade jewelry out of it. She has very good taste. But somebody shows up mid-
afternoon, says oh, your daughter said you'd trade for that nice pair of silver earrings that she got. And we go 
yeah, start wrapping Bob. 
 
RB  38:08   
She did. 
 
SG  38:22   
But she, she enjoyed it for a few years. 
 
MM  38:28   
Good experience. 
 
RB  38:33   
And I guess my children's first jobs was being an apprentice of the studio, which is why they don't like clay. 
 
SG  38:40   
After Bob showed Shannon around and said this is how you make the clay and this is how you ball up the clay. 
This is how you weigh it and measure it and that sort of thing. The next day, she brought her brother out and said 
this is how you do it. Wouldn't you rather have this job than me? And we said no, no, it's got to be you.  
 
RB  38:59   
I paid Shannon, by the hour. And she would 
 
SG  39:04   
She would take the ball of clay and go over and sit down and shape it. And then sigh and then get up, take the ball 
back and set it down, get the next lump of clay and go to... Alex was a different story. 
 
RB  39:18   
Alex was just the opposite. I didn't pay him by the hour I paid, I paid him  
 
SG 39:22 
By the job. 
 
RB 39:23 
by the job. And when he, when I said make 200 balls of clay. He would zip right through it and in a half hour, 45 
minutes, he he'd have all that clay done. And he didn't work for four hours doing 200 balls of clay. 
 
SG  39:38   
He wanted to get back to his friends and so he was very efficient at it  
 
RB  39:43   
Should have thought of that the first time too. 
 
MM  39:45   
Well, live and learn, right? 
 
RB  39:46   
Yup. 
 
MM  39:51   
You were both working, in different ways, full time in clay for quite a while. How did that, how did that balance 
work? 
 
SG  40:01   
There were a few years where we would pass the children back and forth like Olympic torches, "Here. I've got to 
go." We were working together but separately, you know that somebody always had had dibs on the kids and 
somebody always had, "I've got to go out in the studio and work now." It was, it was a very hectic time. But we 
wanted to be with our kids. What's the point of sending them off to daycare or whatever? Now, MCC had a 
wonderful child care center and sometimes when I'd go to work I'd take them in after they were about three or 
four and they loved that. 
 
RB  40:37   
Especially when I had to be out of town. Yeah, well, there's that. 
 
SG  40:42   
And Bob and I became scouting parents. So we went through Tigers and into Cub Scouts and then right on up 
through, Bob stayed with that. But when you make the transition from Cub Scouts, to Boy Scouts, they really 
prefer the dads to be the big thing. So Bob became a leader, and they did a lot of camping and Alex actually got 
his Eagle when he was in high school. And so they had a lot of time together with that. Shannon ended up going 
to 4-H and I was the mom that you know, one of the moms that participated in that so that we each had activities 
we did with the kids. Again, it was, I think around middle school, they could not yet drive. They were in different 
schools for a little while because they go from grade school to middle school to the high school and so there were 
always different hours, different buses sometimes and many more before school and after school activities. And 
that kind of, we will write down the schedule and we are crossing things off every day, lasted until Alex got his 
driver's license. And we helped, you know he had some money for a car we helped him a little bit with that and he 
had to pay his own insurance, but the day he turned 16 he was going, "So, can we go over today?" And things just 
eased up a great deal. Because an awful lot of what you do with your kids is hauling them around, in middle 
school, I don't know how old your son is. 
 
MM  42:24   
Two and a half. 
 
RB  42:24   
When he was a kid... spectacular. 
 
SG  42:26   
Oh, yeah, you have not gotten computer generated randomized holidays from the school system yet but you will, 
you will. 
 
MM  42:35   
Something to look forward to! 
 
RB  42:36   
But, it was a spectacular partnership, having had clay together, and having kids together, and being able to have 
all of that work, and every, each of us knew what the other one was going through at all times. That, it just was a 
wonderful life for 
 
SG  42:57   
Yeah.  
 
And we had the cub scouts over to do their badges and, and make clay and we had the Boy Scouts over to do 
badges and have some clay and some craft stuff. And we had the 4-H kids over to have it, so we, we incorporated 
what our life was and the children were not... significantly appreciative at the time. But Shannon, who now, she 
became a librarian and technical services director, is in California and she said "Oh, I don't talk about my home 
life. I talked about you guys." Because it's, you know, my parents are cool. My parents are potters. They did this, 
they got, oh look dad's in a magazine, he got an award. So, she has found us to be very useful. And Alex has gone 
from, I don't know what they do, to, to, oh, it's a great place to bring a date. "Look, these are my parents, the 
potters, isn't that cool." So we finally achieved a status with our children. 
 
RB  42:59   
years and years here.  
 
SG  44:06   
It is real busy, running a studio because being in the studio is very full time. And teaching, if it's done right is very 
full time and parenting is very full time, and there were several layers of full time. I went back for a degree when 
Alex was in kindergarten and Shannon was in second grade, and I think that was probably the most hectic we 
were. It was a commuter degree, I would fly out to Vermont college once every six months, then I would have a 
mentor visit in the studio and talk me through things and I'd be writing my papers. I remember that as probably 
the most sleep deprived time of my life, compared to just, the children being little and waking up sometimes, that 
was, that was nothing compared to doing the school or the degree, the studio, the kids, the whole house thing. But 
we made it work because both of us understood what the other was going through a lot. 
 
RB  45:13   
And I guess it's, that the, if I had learned anything when I was in, going through college and I wanted to be an 
artist, I thought oh, I wanted to be an artist, I want to create things and I want to do stuff. I did not realize that 
being an artist was a business. And that I made a lot of mistakes at the very beginning of my company when I 
started it. Because I didn't know about business. And I didn't know how to ask for help. I didn't know what I had 
to ask for help. And boy, if I had any advice to any artist, or potter, who wants to be successful, take a few 
business classes when you're young, so that you know what you're doing and ask for professional help get an 
account, get a publicist, or somehow trade or you know, however, however you can afford it. Those kinds of 
things do help tremendously. Being a potter, being an artist is actually a business as well. And you really need to 
know some of the ins and outs of how to become a business. When you're a potter. 
 
MM  46:37   
So you talked about having the kids work in the studio and having an occasional assistant, would you talk again a 
little bit about how that worked for you or didn't work for you to have somebody helping in the studio? 
 
RB  46:54   
For the many, many of the times when I had someone trying to work for me, I had a really hard time figuring out 
exactly what I wanted them to do. I tried having someone come in and just do things like clean the studio once a 
week, or to, weighing out clay so that I could make the mugs more efficiently, or waxing the bottoms of pieces 
that I wanted to glaze. And those little chores were fine. But it still didn't, didn't give me any more time with 
either the family or being able to make more pottery. So I tried having an apprentice once or twice, someone who 
was either just starting grad school or whatever. And it was, I ended up trying to be more of a teacher than I was... 
getting enough work from them that it was cost effective. It was actually costing me more of my time, than was 
worth having an apprentice. That was the one thing that I'm sad about, is that I wish I could have had more of a 
 
SG  48:18   
A mentorship? 
 
RB  48:21   
I wish I, wish I would have been able to figure out a way of being able to pass this on to someone else who, or 
give some advice to someone. But it just never seemed to work out, the pieces that they were making or never the 
quality that I could resell and the handles that they would put up mugs would not work very well. Because they 
were learning! 
 
SG  48:43   
Except for the one. [pause] I made, I made mugs for Bob. 
 
RB  48:50   
You still make things for me now!  
 
SG  48:51   
I still, there are still pieces that we do cooperatively where I will throw them and he will glaze them. There are 
certain things galleries want that it's just easier for me to do. So after the two graduate degrees I now do 
piecework.  
 
RB  49:06   
And actually that started out at the very beginning, from having the, this gallery that's here, and someone saying 
to me, "Do you do tea pots?" and tea pots are very hard to make because there's so many parts and so many pieces 
for a teapot. And I said "No, I don't. But Susan makes tea pots." "Well, I don't like her colors." So she would 
make the tea pot and I glaze it in my colors. Or, someone would like my pieces, but they didn't like my colors, 
they wanted Susan's colors, so we would be able to collaborate that way. And make pieces for each other and the 
other one would glaze it, so that we can do special orders. And that has now evolved into this whole wholesale 
thing where she will do three or four pieces for me that she can do them much more efficiently than I can. 
 
SG  50:01   
But then you do the glazing  
 
RB  50:02   
And I do the glazing.  
 
SG  50:03   
and they're your firing 
 
RB  50:04   
The gallery thinks that I made them, which is fine. I don't make very many pieces for her. 
 
SG  50:11   
Well that's because I don't do full time, and... We just retired from special orders. We've been in the process of 
retiring for the last decade, we still plan on working, but every once in awhile we'll look at, it's like Bob retired 
from art fairs. He still does full time pottery, but he doesn't do art fairs really anymore. And we just got in a series 
of special orders where people are going, "Well, can you do this? But can you do that? And you made this mug 20 
years ago, can you reproduce the clay and the colors and the exact style?" Which of course you have to remember 
perfectly. Because, from 20 years, why would you not know? And 
 
RB  50:52   
The comment was, after we took pictures, "here it is, do you want it?" They said, "Yes, we want it." And then 
they got it. And they said "We really liked it, but it had more brown in it last, last time." 
 
SG  51:01   
And so we looked at each other, and went, were retiring from special orders, too. So we, and I think that's part of 
why we're still interested is, so much of what we do is, it's because it's what we want to do. It's not like, "Oh gosh, 
it's Monday morning, we have to go out and..." On Sunday, Bob was out here watching the game while he was 
glazing pots, it's just, it's not a job, it's part of our lives. And it 
 
RB  51:32   
And like I said at the very beginning, it's not, it's not the, what I make, it's not how good I make it or it's not the, 
the beauty of it, that isn't interesting enough to me. It is the dance that I'm doing with the clay day in and day out. 
That is what is, makes me get up in the morning is, is being able to sit at the wheel and make those pots and trim 
them and make them, and then have them come out of the process and you know, look at them and say good, I can 
sell that one, can make more. Because it's the process that is more important to me than the actual piece 
themselves. 
 
MM  52:12   
Would you, since we're recording, would you talk about the pieces of that dance and the, how that works for you a 
little bit more? 
 
RB  52:20   
Yeah. When I am making a piece of pottery, I've always liked doodling and drawing and that kind of thing. But 
when I can doodle and draw three dimensionally in the air, using the earth, and partnering with water to form the 
piece, and then having the air dry it, and after finishing and glazing the pieces, fire it, to harden it and make it a 
useful piece that the general public can use and enjoy. That dance that I, that is with the universe, earth, air, fire, 
and water, is the thing that is the most important thing to me, and is what has always got me up in the morning to 
do pottery. I don't know how else to say it other than that. It's that dance. It's the act of, rather than the piece that's 
finished, is more important to me. 
 
MM  53:36   
And you said, is it 30 different things now that you make, that you've narrowed it down to? 
 
RB  53:40   
Yeah, I've narrowed it down to about 30 pieces. I would always, I was experimenting with different things in 
different forms and the same form but different ways. And what would be interesting for someone to use, and 
have in the kitchen or to put on their wall, or to decorate their house with. And after refining all of those different 
ways of forming different forms, and different pieces of clay, decorating them in certain ways, I found the styles 
of 30 pieces that I really enjoyed making a lot. And the two colors that I relate to very well. The two colors, I'll 
show you... 
 
This is my landscape design. It's a, the reason why I like it so much is because it reminds me of all of the traveling 
that I had done, it's a landscape feel to the pieces, it's Southwest, I just love that part of the country. My favorite 
stone in nature is, I can't remember the... picture agate. Picture agate has that kind of landscape thing, there's 
different colors. And sometimes it's orange, sometimes it's yellow, sometimes it's brown, sometimes it's red. But 
there's always layers to it. And that's what this is, it's layers. And it reminds me of traveling down the road and 
seeing the wheat fields, or the sand, or whatever it is with the sky at the top and the horizon line. So that's what 
this particular color scheme has related to. I started doing the blue ones, which is, see that one, that was the color 
that I did in the 90s and early 2000s. And then I developed this color, which gave me a different style. 
 
And then the other color is oil spot blue, which is a, can the camera see? Oil spot blue, which was, again, one of 
those happy accidents that come. This glaze is made up of dipping the piece in black, and then dipping the piece 
again in black, so that this is a double layer of black, then dipping the piece in white, then dipping the piece in 
white again, so it's a double layer of white. In the kiln, that's when the magic happens. I could tell you that I take a 
brush and put every little dot in there myself, but that would take forever and ever for each individual piece. But 
what happens in the kiln, because of the chemistry that is involved, is that the black glaze, or the white glaze melts 
first. And then the black glaze melts underneath it. There's a gas that's created between those two layers of things 
and that gas has to, it bubbles, the white glaze and it has to escape so it pops. So the black glaze shows through 
where the little bubbles pop. Thin bubbles where there's a thin layer of glaze, where there's a double layer of glaze 
it's a thicker bubble, bigger bubble so it pops and gives that kind of design. So it's a, that was, when I found that 
technique, I refined it to the point where now it's pretty consistent. And I, just happy, lovey, wonderful thing. And 
the millennials like this color better than the landscape. Those people who are very much into nature, and into 
craft... what do you call the kind of crafts that... I can't remember the name of... anyway. They've enjoyed the 
landscape pieces, the ones that look like nature. The millennials like this, because it goes very well with the metal 
and glass top tables. 
 
MM  58:12   
Interesting. You know your audience then. Well Susan, would you talk more about your philosophy of making 
and your style of pottery and that sort of thing?  
 
SG 58:29 
Where Bob reproduces the same piece, and that gives him great joy and satisfaction to see 20 or 30 mugs sitting 
there, or 50 or 100 mugs because he does production pottery, I do what is called limited production pottery. And 
every piece is by design slightly different. I did years of doing sets, and now I think more in terms of coordinating 
rather than in terms of matching. And every year I try to bring into production, a new piece that I haven't done 
before. Over the last few years, there have been garlic pots and French butter dishes and cheese trays, something 
different every year that I'm interested in. But the first time I throw something or hand build something, it is not 
professional. There's a six month or a year arc of how does this get the design tightened, and the glaze adapted 
and get it to the point where I want to send it out into the world. 
 
While I'm doing that, every one of them is going to be a little bit different. And I do a lot of stamping and a lot of 
altering on my work so that it is different then, because that gives me a great deal of joy to manipulate clay and to 
have that, not just a surface, but to have something into the surface and something past the surface, so that there is 
a depth, not just to the glaze, but to the clay itself. And I like it because it just emphasizes the three-
dimensionality. And it also emphasizes the artists input. If you go to the Art Institute, and you look at their 
collection of wonderful, wonderful ceramics, especially the Asian ones, the Japanese and the Chinese, you can see 
the grip that someone used to dunk that. And you can see the fingerprints of somebody who's been dead for 2 or 
3000 years, and is doing the same kind of pottery and has the same traditions behind that person as I have. I love 
the continuity of that. So as much as I tried to do new things, I don't think there's a lot that is new in clay. The 
French butter crocks that I'm doing are back to a 17th or 18th century design, to keep butter when they didn't have 
refrigeration. The garlic jars are from the American Southwest to keep the garlic from growing green shoots on 
the counter.  
 
RB  1:01:10   
Yarn bowls are from early on when they were knitting and making your own clothes in the 17th century. 
 
SG  1:01:18   
So I love to work within that tradition of making practical, functional things, putting my twist on it, and just 
enjoying the process a lot. 
 
MM  1:01:31   
Did your students influence your work when you were teaching?  
 
SG  1:01:34   
Oh, enormously. It's the thing that I miss most about teaching, especially the advanced class, which met every 
Thursday morning for four hours. It was like having a mini workshop, and party, and gossip fest all at the same 
time, because all these women had known each other for a long time. And we would roll in and I would always 
have something collected to show them. This is a new technique. This is a new trick. This is how this other thing 
is done and they would 
 
 
Audio File #2 (afc2018030_04440_sr02.wav) 
 
SG  0:00   
also, because some of them started going to NCECA, they started doing the Twenty Hands Pottery Tour up in 
Wisconsin, they started going to places and they'd bring things back. "How is this done? What is this? Why is 
this?" in some cases, and it was just so informative for me and so much fun. And I really enjoyed that collegiality. 
And that exposure. I do not miss large parts of teaching. I do not miss faculty meetings, I do not miss staff 
meetings. And in fact, when they were about six months ago, talking about arming teachers, one of the 
administrators says I have seen staff meetings, it's a good argument against giving them guns. 
 
RB  0:50   
And she doesn't miss that loading and unloading the kiln  
 
SG  0:52   
Yes  
 
RB  0:52   
for every student that's there. 
 
SG  0:54   
My work went in last it, it was point of professionalism that the student work goes in first. And first semester goes 
in first, second semester goes in the second, third semester, and then fourth, and it just meant I would have to fire 
more. But one of the joys of having my very own kiln, not even one that I share with Bob, but my very own kiln 
is, every single piece in that kiln goes where I want it to go, and every single piece is mine. I don't have, even 
make up, a little twinge of conscience that I am putting a lopsided pinch pot that I know the glaze is bad on, 
instead of a mug that I'd really wanted to see a new glaze for. So on the whole, I am happy that I am retired from 
teaching but I do miss the collegiality of that large group of people because we worked quite well together. A lot 
of them are still in the Clay Workers Guild, so I still see them. And I've taught a couple of them to play mahjong. 
 
MM  1:57   
That's great. 
 
SG  1:57   
Yeah.  
 
MM  1:58   
That's really great.  
 
SG  1:59   
So yes, we all socialize together still. 
 
MM  2:02   
Wonderful. Would you tell the story of your kiln again? 
 
SG  2:07   
Okay. The last few years that I was working at MCC we had ordered a Geil kill, which is just a wonderful kiln 
and I'd really enjoyed firing it and I joked around and nobody took me up on it, that I would really like that as a 
retirement gift. I didn't get that, I got a ring instead. But I had really enjoyed that kiln, and I did not enjoy firing 
the kiln that Bob had here at home. And he was full time. And so the kiln was full time. It was a sacrifice for him 
to let me use the kiln and take up five or six days of what could have been his production time. So I had told a 
friend of ours, at Great Lakes Clay, that I was looking for a Geil kiln and if he could find me a Geil kiln, I couldn't 
afford a new one but... and he came back and said, "I found a Geil kiln for you. It's in a little college town in 
central Indiana, you'd have to go pick it up, but she really wants to get rid of it because she's going low fire in the 
studio." And I said "That's fine. I'm, you know, I'm from Indiana, where is it?" "DePauw University." And I, it 
just, it touched me because I had graduated from DePauw University, Richard and Marge Peeler were not just 
faculty members, but my mentors. They had had me out to their house and I had gotten to see how a family in 
pottery had, could live. And it was a, very much 
 
RB  3:46   
They were both potters. 
 
SG  3:47   
Oh, yes, they were both potters, they worked very well together. And this kiln was in the Richard E Peeler Art 
Center, and I wrote a fawning, obnoxious, obsequious letter saying how much I wanted this kiln and what I was 
willing to pay for it and how this continued the tradition of pottery from Richard Peeler who had taught me my 
first pottery, and this was coming from his art center, and I really wanted to be able to produce pots with it. And 
they said yes. So we got down there got it picked up and got it back. And then about a year and a half after I 
retired from teaching I had a kiln that I could go much more full time, or much more intensely part time. Now my 
philosophy still is the opposite of Bob's, Bob has an online presence. You can go to Blue Eagle Pottery dot com. 
Bob has a wholesale crafts dot com presence. I have by design no presence at all on the internet. If you want my 
work, you go to one of the two small, three small galleries that I supply, or you come to the home show, because 
that's about as much work as I can produce in a year. And I like that. It's personal, it's local. And I get to play. I 
don't come out and think I've got to do 200 mugs. I come out and say, I think I'd like to do mugs today. And I do 
20 or 30 of them, then I take the dog for a walk. 
 
RB  5:32   
And I do not come out to the studio and think I have to do 200 mugs today, I think I want to come out and play 
with clay and then end up doing 200 mugs.  
 
MM  5:40   
That's really great. 
 
SG  5:44   
We're still happy to be here. Yeah, we're still, we still come out every day. I'll take a few days off for this or that, 
and then I will get itchy. I will, I will be drawn back to it. And I've seen Bob do the same thing. We've taken off 
time this year because our daughter got married and there was five or six days in California, plus getting ready for 
it. And then the neice got married. And that was several days off. And by the time we had finished these, these 
two or three different events, we both could hardly wait to get back to the studio, because we have missed it. And 
that's one of the reasons clay is in our life is when it's not there, we miss it tremendously. We just like being out 
here. 
 
MM  6:34   
I feel like there's a partner kiln story that ought to be told, you've got two really interesting kilns out there. So 
Robert, would you talk about the history of your kiln? 
 
RB  6:43   
Okay. When I was in undergraduate school, Northern Illinois University had Alpine kilns. And so I, like Susan 
wasn't affiliated toward the Alpine brand of kiln instead of a Geil. And so when I was looking for a kiln to put in 
the studio, then when we came here in 1982, I was also looking for a used kiln because young potters cannot 
afford new kilns. And so, I asked Nick Nero, who was my clay supplier to find me a kiln, and he said that he had 
one in his, in his little shed there. And so I went out, I looked at it, and it looked like it was in pretty good shape. 
And so I said that I would take that kiln, and we brought it over here. And I looked at the serial number, and there 
wasn't. So I was curious, because I just didn't know where, how it came to be in his little shed anyway. And he 
said that that was the original kiln that was designed by the Alpine company, the first kiln that they ever built, that 
used to fire their baffles, didn't fire pottery, just fired baffles. But that after they refined it from that original kiln, 
then they just put it aside. And when Alpine was bought by Nick Nero the kiln was brought from California to 
Illinois, and then from his little shed to my studio. And it has been since 1982, which would be what, almost 50 
years right? Maybe 60, 50 years, but the kiln was built in 1954. And that was four years after I was born. So six 
years after I was born. So it's almost as old as I am. And it's still in good shape, and it fires quite adequately for 
me. I think that I do between 40 and 48 firings a year in that kiln. Almost once a week, almost once a week. 
 
MM  9:17   
And you use electric kilns for bisque. 
 
RB  9:19   
Yes. 
 
MM  9:21   
Okay. 
 
SG  9:24   
And it has kept us from having a lot of problems that I am not using his kiln and complaining about the firing. 
And that he does not have to wait for me to get my things out of the kiln, in order to be able to fire it. We are two 
kiln family. 
 
RB  9:42   
But, but we have tried in an emergency situation. My kiln is very old. And it has been gerry rigged and fixed and 
re-fixed and new parts were put on old parts, and I always I feel that because I'm firing so much, one of these days 
it's just going to stop. You know, parts wear out. And so for a while, five years ago, I put a number of pieces in 
her kiln, see if it would fire with my glazes. And it took six or eight firings to actually get it to work to the point 
where my glazes would come up just like I wanted to in her kiln. Just in case my kiln gave up the ghost. So we 
can share the kiln if we had to, if the old kiln decides not to work for awhile. 
 
MM  10:41   
It's good to have a contingency plan  
 
SG  10:44   
Yes, it is. 
 
MM  10:44   
Good. So, but, you've talked about, you know, preferring different types of firings. Oxidation, reduction, so really 
you wouldn't ideally be firing pieces together, that... 
 
RB  10:59   
No. 
 
SG  11:00   
No, we do not. I do a lot more glaze testing than Bob, because I am still looking for different and, and unique. 
And I will always put the glaze tests in his kiln as well just to see what they will do. But he has no real interest in 
using any new colors. And I am always on the look out for just that. That next different thing to see how this 
could incorporate into my work. So when I do glaze testing, he fires politely for me, he fires to see what those 
glaze tests look like in his kiln as well. But no, separate kilns makes for a happier family.  
 
MM  11:40   
That's great. That's great. So, what's next for either of you? What are you looking forward to in the future? Or 
what do you think might change in the next few years? Do you have plans, or? 
 
SG  11:56   
This seems like a pinnacle that we've reached, you know, we have the time to be out here. We've worked together, 
we work separately. And we're producing about as many pots as we care to produce. We hope that this kind of 
lasts for a while.  
 
MM  12:11   
That's great.  
 
SG  12:11   
Took a long time to get here. 
 
RB  12:15   
Yeah, it is very comfortable, now to have this kind... I guess, in the future, I might allow the shops and galleries to 
slowly fade away to the point where I would go part time or three quarters time. This is my seventh decade. So I 
don't know how much longer I will be able to continue making pots. But I hope to do it for quite a while. So 
instead of doing full time, I may go down to three quarters time or halftime and do more of the mahjong and 
board games, and going out to dinner, instead of always coming out and doing clay. I do work about... right now, I 
do work about six hours a day, seven days a week. I might take an afternoon off or something. But that's my 
schedule. So it's still a 40 hour week. 
 
MM  13:22   
Do you feel like a lot of that's dictated by the clay needing attention all the time? Or is that... 
 
RB  13:27   
It's just what I want to do? Yeah. 
 
SG  13:30   
And yes, it is not unusual to be out here after dinner. It is not unusual to take off time in the mid afternoon to go 
see a movie. But then to, the next day be out here at 6:30 or 7 uncovering pots and then going to the grocery store 
and then coming back to the pottery. It, it gets to be not work, just part of your life. It's not a chore. 
 
RB  14:01   
So, no, I'm not looking to become more famous than I am. Or to add more galleries to the point where I want to 
have employees and expand the business. Because I'm feeling comfortable working the way I work in how many 
hours I work, and the way that I work. So there's not really any future plans to change anything. And I guess it's 
been almost, it's almost been eight, nine years now that I've felt this way. 
 
MM  14:35   
That's great. Well, and obviously your space and your routines have been through a number of changes, that 
you've gotten to a place that works well for you. 
 
SG  14:45   
It's wonderful. It's wonderful. 
 
MM  14:49   
Is there anything I've missed, or anything that I didn't ask about that you feel really passionate about or that you, is 
really important to your work? I always like to leave it a little open, at the end. 
 
SG  15:01   
I think it's a lot easier to be a partner, if you're part of a husband, wife, potter team, or a pottery duo for work or 
whatever. It's very lonely, if you're all by yourself, and most of us go into the arts because we can stand to be by 
ourselves a lot. But to have the support of another person to have somebody else you can talk over, is that handle 
a little short, why is this glaze not working? Do you think the kiln is doing this, that or the other thing? 
 
RB  15:36   
That's the hardest part. Why is this glaze not working? We have more discussions about that than almost anything 
else. 
 
SG  15:45   
We're not going to talk about problem child. 
 
RB  15:48   
Why did, why did my blue glaze all of a sudden decide not to do the big bubbles and just little bubbles? 
Whatever? 
 
SG  15:56   
Yeah, we have rousing conversations of interest to nobody else in world except us. But to have a partner, either a 
business partner or a life partner to play that off of who is also into pottery in either the same way or 
complimentary way is just wonderful. And it's why I loved teaching. It's why the guild has been so successful. It's 
why we've stayed together. Because you need that input, that, that feeling that somebody else is involved in it, as 
you are, and as interested in it as you are it's kind of like being parents nobody else is as interested in your kids as 
you are. And this is our baby. This isn't, this is what we have been doing in complimentary but not the same ways 
for a while. What else? 
 
RB  16:59   
I'm in my 50th year doing pottery, 52 years now or something. And I started when I was 18 years old. Not going 
to do anything else. 
 
MM  17:15   
That's wonderful that you've been able to... What happened with your roommate who took the pottery class with 
you? 
 
RB  17:23   
Oh, he went on into advertising and 
 
MM  17:26   
of course 
 
RB  17:29   
Designed Cheerios boxes or something, I don't know. 
 
MM  17:31   
I guess that you won the bet. 
 
RB  17:34   
I guess. 
 
MM  17:38   
That's great. That's really great. Thank you both. I really appreciate it.  
 
SG  17:41   
Oh, you're so welcome. This was fun.
