PREFACE. 
THE title of this little book is that of a 
song so 
successfully sung by Mr. Vivian at some of the 
principal minstrel halls in America. 
This gentle-
man (who sings with great success those comic 
songs now so popular in London, and fast becoming 
so here), is daily adding to his deserved popularity. 
Mr. Vivian has a remarkably clear, 
strong, 
musical voice, which, together with his gentlemanly 
bearing, and an entire absence of vulgarity, makes 
his songs so popular; and they are songs which 
depend altogether on the corstic element to make 
them so, and not, as is too frequently the case, on 
coarse allusions and vulgar inuendoes. 
Comic singing has of late years become so pop-
ular, that it has penetrated even to our social gath-
erings. 
It is to meet the wants of amateur vocalists that 
this little book is issued, and the publisher has 
taken particular care to render this work in every 
respect worthy the name of a 
drawing-room songster, 
and to expunge anything that even savors of vul-
garity. 
This work contains most of the songs which 
have earned for Mr. Vivian his fame as a 
comic 
singer, by his successful rendering of them. 
Bryant's Canebrake Refrains.

Preface. 
Mr. Vivian has made arrangements with the 
largest publishers on the other side to furnish him 
with the newest and best songs published in Lon-
don, in order that he may at all times be able to 
gratify his numerous hearers with the choicest 
gems of comic singing. 
It is hoped that all admirers of Mr. Vivian will 
purchase this ten cents worth of comic gems, and 
recommend it to all their friends as a 
tribute to 
the versatile ability of the gentleman whose name 
it heads, and who has done so much to place comic 
singing on a 
par with ballad singing, by never 
saying or singing anything that could call up the 
blush of shame on the cheeks of his hearers.

WHO STOLE THE DONKEY 
Written and sung by CHARLES VIVIAN. 
KIND friends, just listen to my song, 
its a 
new one I've invented, 
And when you've heard how I 
was wronged, 
I'm sure ' twill be lamented. 
One fine day I 
took a 
stroll, 
Full of pleasure, fun and glee, 
With a 
new white hat upon my poll, 
When some boys did shout at me, 
CHORUS. 
" 
Who stole the donkey '? who stole the donkey 
Who stole the donkey I " those boys did say, 
"WHO with a

I 
turned around, feeling in a 
racre, 
But the boys they kept on shouting, 
If they had been upon a 
stage, 
You might have thought them spouting. 
But I 
found myself in such a 
mess, 
While being out on this spree, 
With my new white hat and evening dress, 
Those boys did shout at rue 
Who stole the donkey, etc. 
A 
policeman came up at the time, 
The noise to ascertain then 
lie tried to quell the mob, you know, 
But his efibrts were in vain then ; 
They began to smash him on the poll, 
And seeing he was in for a 
spree, 
I 
ran and left it to himself, 
While the boys did shout at me 
Who stole the donkey, etc.

But where she has gone to, I'm sure I 
can't tell.

Her home and her parents are highly respectable. 
her mother milks cows on a 
three-legged stool, 
Her father's a 
farmer what grows the green turnip 
tops, 
Her sister is a 
dairy- maid, and her brother's a 
fool. 
But I 
weeps and 1 
wanders, etc. 
She is a 
charming young gender, her waist is so 
slender, 
Tier hair is magenta, and she squints with one 
eye, 
She speaks when she's talking, and she moves when 
she's walking, 
And if I 
don't find her I'm sure I 
shall die. 
For I 
weeps and I 
wanders, etc. 
I 
courted sweet Jenny, and told her I 
loved her, 
We were to be married upon a May morn, 
But there came a gay soldier in the " 42d Stand 
Backs," 
Ani on the next nmrning my Jenny wasgone. 
For I 
weeps and I 
wanders, etc. 
But I 
never shall find her, she's gone with her 
soldier, 
So farewell to the Nanny goats and the moo cows 
so brown, 
Farewell to the violets, to the sea shore I'll wan-
der, 
And in the cold water I'll lay myself down. 
CHORUS. 
And no more will I 
wander over dales and over 
mountains, 
For the loss of my true love where'er she may be.

THE BROKEN-HEARTED SHEPHERD. 
I'm in a 
quandary, 
For I've lost my Mary. 
That she's been and jilted me, 
To think I 
am inclined. 
I've searched all over mountains, 
In ponds and lakes and fountains, 
Looked into wells and water-butts, 
But no Mary can I 
find. 
CHORUS. 
Oh! Mary, Oh! Mary, 
how could you be so contrary*? 
Oh! Mary, Oh! Mary, 
Why did you treat your true love so 7 
I 
said to my Mary, 
" 
Love, we'll keep a 
dairy; 
When we've got our bit of land, 
how shall our garden grow 7 " 
She scarcely ruminated, 
lire her desire she stated ; 
'Twas, " Silver bells, and cockei-shells, 
And cowslips all in a 
row." 
Oh! Mary, Oh ' Mary, etc. 
I've about been creeping, 
Neath the hay- cocks peeping, 
Thinking she like " Bopeep " might 
Go there repose to find ; 
My sheep too, I 
cah't find them, 
Tho' she told me she'd mind them ; 
But left alone they'll come home, 
And bring their tails behind them. 
Oh! Mary, Oh! Mary, etc.

Cock- a-doodle doo too, 
One day lost his shoe too, 
Likewise lost his fiddlestick, 
And sadly did it rise too ; 
Although he was in trouble,

That cockamy doodle-doo! 
Oh! Mary, Oh I 
Mary, etc. 
PRETTY JEDIDIA. 
MY 
love she lives in a 
two pair back, 
Her eyes are bright as stars of night; 
Of falling in love I've got a 
knack, 
And she is the girl for me ; 
At six o'clock she leaves off work, 
At seven she's finished her tea, 
At eight she's dressed in all her best, 
And she comes for a 
walk with me. 
CHORUS. 
Oh! pretty Jemima, don't say no, 
Oh hi oh, don't say no, 
Pretty Jemitna don't say no, 
And we will married be. 
I 
once was afraid to speak outright, 
I 
was so shy I 
feared to try, 
The thought of it putt me all in a 
fright, 
So I'd grizzle and pine all day ; 
I 
was getting as thin as a 
scaffold pole, 
My buttons all fell away, 
And just because I 
hadn't the nerve, 
To pluck up courage and say, 
Oh! pretty Jemima, etc.

We went for a 
walk not long ago, 
Thinks I, somehow I'll tell you now, 
I 
just was going to let her know, 
When she spied a 
milliner's shop ; 
A 
hat and feathers was there for sale, 
I 
couldn't do less than stop ; 
By the time I 
had bought it my courage had gone, 
And I 
couldn't the question pop. 
Oh! pretty Jemima, etc. 
At last one morning I 
bought the 'inn-, 
And hit on a 
plan to make me a 
man ; 
Thinks I 
to myself, this is the thing, 
This night shall cast the die, 
I 
held it up, " look ye here," I 
said; 
The moment it caught, her eye 
Her lovely cheeks were suffused with red, 
And seeing no one was by, I 
said, 
Oh ! pretty Jemima, etc. 
Of course I 
was anxious to know my fate, 
I 
almost dread the words I 
said, 
Whether to be Nvith joy elate, 
Or be the most wretched of men ; 
She tried it on her finger and said, 
'Twas a 
little too large, but then, 
I 
could buy a 
keeper and we'd get wed 
Next Sunday morning at ten. 
And pretty Jemima, etc.

Nine times out of ten we see wealthy men 
Refusing the good things of life to enjoy, 
As life is so short, don't you think that we ought 
To like fighting cocks live ? 
I 
believe you, my 
boy. 
It's all very well for our spouses to tell 
Us poor Benedicts that we're treating them ill, 
By rolling home tight almost ev'ry night, 
In cold wintry weather, which does them most 
kill; 
Between you and I, don't you think on the sly, 
They all in our absence themselves well enjoy, 
On a 
small drain of gin, some nook hidden in, 
Known to none but themselves 7 I 
believe you, 
my boy. 
So often do we down area steps see 
Those men in dark blue, who are styled the 
'Stead of quelling a 
row, very often I 
vow, 
They're discovered 0' 
eutly breaking the piece 
Of a 
nice rabbit pie, when in some dark street by, 
They'll the top of their tile as a 
table employ ; 
Think these cunning blue elves don't take care of 
themselves, 
And live just like lords 7 I 
believe you, my boy. 
The newly-made bride gets her beau tightly tied 
In bonds from which he ue'er himself can re-
lease, 
Then day after day he beholds in dismay, 
how greatly in number relations increase ; 
Those whom she'd kept dark come up then to the 
mark, 
Ife daren't say a 
word, or farewell to his joy ; 
With a 
heart ill at ease don't you think he then sees, 
That, lie's married the lot ? 
I 
believe you, my 
boy.

A 
plain fact or two I've endeavored to show; 
All night I 
could sing bout the same sort of thing, 
But prudence now whispers ' tis quite time to go. 
In bestowing applause I 
can see no just cause 
Why your hands and your feet you should not

MY OLD WIFE AND I. 
I 
MERRILY sing from morn till night, 
And misery I 
defy ; 
And I've a 
wife, who with delight, 
Sings just as happy as I. 
She is the comfort of my heart, 
My darling and my pride ; 
For forty long years together, my boys, 
We've travelled it side by side. 
CHORUS. 
Round goes the world, 
And troubles I 
defy, 
Jop-aing along together, my boys, 
My dear old wife and I. 
In winter, when the snow is down, 
She meets me at the door, 
Saying, ' Come in lad. and warm yourself, 
You must be cold, I'm sure; 
Come sit down by the fire-side," 
She'll say, " and take your tea ;" 
She laughs and jokes on the other side, 
It's a

At night, when home returning, 
She greets me with a

Her dear old face beams with delight, 
In such a 
pleasant style. 
She brings my slippers, warm and dry, 
And places them at my side ; 
I 
never could find her equal, 
Though I've travelled the world so wide. 
Then round goes the world, etc. 
So I 
smoke my pipe and sing my song, 
Content to stay at home, 
As happy as the day is long,

Some may long for single life, 
And others for freedom sigh; 
But that shall never be the case 
With my old wife and I.

THE HOLE IN lilt SHUTTER. 
MISTER Drake, a 
cheesemonger and poulterer com-
bined, 
Kept a 
house with a 
shop and small parlor behind ; 
And by plucking and singing and sticking to trade, 
And drawing his birds, had some yellow boys made. 
But with the hot season his troubles too came, 
And a 
close murky night would oft spoil all his 
game ; 
So to keep his shop cool and preserve more his 
butters, 
Determin'd in cutting round holes in his shutters. 
Tho' aged forty-five, for the first time in life, 
he'd recently married a 
good-lookim.r, wife : 
The House of Elmore.

She was some years his junior, and had been a 
cook, 
And made up the match when he made up her 
book I 
A shopman of course he was bound to engage, 
A 
cousin of his wife and about the same age ; 
And of hams and of bacon the best of all cutters, 
And useful at night just to pop up the shutters. 
Thus related, the shopman and good Mrs. D. 
Were perhaps not as distant as strangers might be, 
Which annoy'd Mr. Drake, for he couldâ¢ not resist 
The idea but what something perhaps wrong might 
exist. 
His jealousy roused was not quickly subdued, 
lie watched and each look into love misconstrued ; 
Took nightly his pipe with his friend Mr. Rutter, 
And returning he'd peep thro' a 
hole in the shut-
ter. 
To her spouse after dinner one day Mrs. D. 
Said, " this afternoon, dear, I 
intend taking tea 
At my old friend, Miss Brown's, without thinking, 
no doubt, 
Of the shopman whom Drake had let half a day 
out. 
So, so, said old Drake when she'd gone, Pll be 
bound, 
That wherever they are they together are found, 
And they'll both come home early, said he, with a 
stutter, 
When I'll catch ' em alive through the hole in the 
shutter. 
For his usual pipe out went Drake about nine, 
Didn't stay but returned in a 
very brief time ; 
in the meantime the shopman came stealthily 
home, 
For a 
quiet half hour with the servant alone.

Straightway in the parlor the loving pair went, 
At love making both were on overtime bent, 
And began to kiss, cuddle and sweet things to 
mutter, 
Just as Drake scrambled up to the hole in the 
shutter. 
Now being near-sighted old Drake of course thought 
how nicely his wife and the shopman he'd caught, 
And revenge deep and dreadful was pond'ring 
upon, 
When a 
second edition of kissing came on. 
" 
1 
say," shouted Drake, " here you, sir, what's your 
game 1 
That's my wife you're kissing, 
Oh ! Mary, for 
shame ;" 
When something gave way, down he rolled in the 
gutterâ 
On shutting the shop he'd not screw'd up the shutter. 
Now to pick up the shutter old Drake didn't stop, 
But jumped o'er the stall board and rushed in the 
shop ; 
When the shopman disturb'd, he for love didn't 
stay, 
But popp'd from the parlor and met him half way; 
With a 
large bacon knife he had courage immense, 
While Drake with his cheese taster stood in defence, 
When faint in the arms of old Drake with a 
flutter, 
Fell the girl just as Mrs. D. came to the shutter. 
With excitement old Drake scarcely knew what to 
do, 
And the girl fainting obstinate wouldn't come to ; 
So unconscious of all save of easing his legs, 
Full length laid her down in a 
box of fresh eggs. 
Mrs. Drake then came in, when the shopman ex-
plained, 
Heirs of Derwentwater.

Tnis life is a

For how many people we see 
With faces as long as a

Of good things enough for its all, 
And yet there's not one out of twenty, 
But thinks that his share is too small.

And a

All courted pretty Jessie, at the railroad bar. 
Now this darling little creature, 
With a 
smile on every feature, 
Was serving all the customers 
With cakes and bitter beer; 
And this was on a 
Monday ; 
So I 
asked her if on Sunday, 
She would meet me at the Park gate, 
When she gave me such a 
leer, 
And then she said to me, 
" 
Most happy I 
should be, 
But I'm sorry to inform you 
That its not my Sunday out; 
One Sunday out of nine, 
Is the only day that's mine ;" 
And then she had to leave me just

Well, better late than never, 
And I 
thought that I 
was clever 
To get Jessie dear to meet me 
When it was her Sunday out. 
With my hair curled and anointed, 
At the time and place appointed, 
I 
was there to the minute, 
And began to look about; 
And when my Jessie came, 
My heart was in a 
flame, 
When I 
saw her waterfall, 
And her bonnet trimmed so gay. 
She politely took my arm, 
I 
admired her every charm; 
But judge of my surprise, 
When I 
heard some urchins say 
SPOKEN.âI 
say, Bill, if there ain't Jessie along 
with another swell ! why, I've seen her with 
A 
tinker and a 
tailor etc. 
Now my confidence was shaken, 
But I 
thought the boys mistaken, 
And my modesty would not permit 
To ask if it was true. 
I 
proposed, and she accepted, 
In a 
manner unaffected, 
And the tears she shed completely 
Hid from me her eyes so blue. 
Then I 
sent her a 
wedding-dress, 
Fit for an empress, 
And saw the porter give it her, 
While serving at the bar. 
But on our wedding-day 
Miss Jessie ran away, 
And got married to a 
man who sold 
The STANDARD and the STAR!

had 
was, she had taken in, besides myself,

THE STYLE IN WHICH IT'S DONE. 
I 
STAND before you once again, 
A few words just to say; 
The subject of my song, I'm sure, 
We each meet every day. 
Some men live fast, and others slow, 
As through the world we run ; 
But so very much depends upon 
The style in which it's done. 
A man shall steal a 
horse, we read, 
And not be " brought to book ;" 
While another man across a 
hedge 
Is not allowed to look. 
This may seem contradictory 
Indeed to many a 
one; 
But so very much depends upon 
The style in which its done. 
The politician speechifies, 
And makes a 
great hurrah! 
Till another man, he mounts the stand, 
And points out every flaw. 
He gets the nomination, 
And for Congress he does run;

The style in which it's done.

Just to steal a

How strange the mystery seems, 
That girls can dash along Broadway, 
Who scarce are in their teens. 
Their pas are poor, but still they dress 
In a 
style that's number one ; 
But I 
suppose it all depends upon 
The style in which it's done.

Perhaps you'll say, " it's time ;"

Written expressly for CHARLES VIVIAN. 
THE world has played some funny pranks 
The twelve months that are past, 
And land and wave in every clime 
Strange omens round her cast. 
Volcanic fires have lit the sky, 
And earthquakes earth has riven; 
And wild tornadoes swept the seas, 
In eighteen- sixty-seven. 
Through Europe's realm the shock of war 
Has tumbled empires down ; 
While diplomatic Yankee skill 
has added to our own ; 
And all the world can boast no clime 
More wealthy, proud, or great 
Than ours, which Freedom calls her own 
In eighteen-sixty-eight. 
'Tis true, the war so lately o'er, 
Confusion did create ; 
And there is much we'd like to see 
For which we'll have to wait ; 
But while the people rule as now, 
And dare their rights maintain, 
Though dark may seem the transient hour, 
'Twill soon be bright again. 
But while we pass o'er lesser things, 
We are determined quite 
Each State within our wide domain, 
Shall have its separate right; 
And those that now are thus deprived, 
We'll quickly re- instate; 
Our Union shall be " one" again 
In eighteen- sixty-eight.

About our proud old Empire State, 
I'll tell you how I 
feel; 
Obnoxious laws have ruled of late, 
Which need a 
quick repeal. 
It's freedom in a 
curious way, 
As you'll agree, I 
think, 
To say that certain days or hours 
We shall not take a 
drink ; 
But let us hope that this will change, 
And justice have fair play, 
For what is wrong must soon or late 
To what is right give way. 
It cannot lastâa 
little while 
We can afford to wait, 
And wish the " good time coming " will 
Be eighteen-sixty-eight. 
Each year its notions, odd and queer, 
Of dress, is sure to bring ; 
And fashions change in mode and style 
Like every other thing. 
Twelve months ago, upon Broadway, 
Each pretty dear we'd meet, 
Expanded so with crinoline, 
Cents had to take the street ; 
But now the thing is quite reversed, 
Contraction's all the go, 
And spreading tilters laid aside 
For robes of ample flow. 
Indeed, to keep from stepping on 
Their trails, the task is great; 
I 
wonder what they'll give us next, 
In eighteen-sixty-eight. 
Now farewell to the year that's gone, 
We'll toast the year to come; 
May peace and plenty be our lot, 
Wherever we may roam.

JEMIMA BROWN. 
'Twas at the railway station, 
Upon the Brighton line, 
I 
first met my Jemima ; 
Why should I 
call her mine ? 
Her hair was light, her eyes were bright, 
Her dress a 
morning gown ; 
A 
travling hex stood by her side, 
Upon it " Jeminia Brown." 
I 
used to take her ev'rywhere, 
To all the sights in town ; 
And then she left me in despair,

To Cremorne we went down. 
Took tea and shrimps, drank bitter beer, 
And waltzed with Jemima Brown.

One night, I 
flew to meet her; 
The weather yet was warm, 
I 
saw her fondly leaning 
On a 
nice young fellow's arm ! 
Against my will I 
felt quite ill ; 
Inquiring with a 
frown, 
"

), 
From town to ease the mind from toil and slaving; 
Along the hills to scramble, and in the waters 
gambol, 
To enjoy a 
little clean and wholesome bathing. 
I 
was a 
single man, and my sweetheart, Mary Ann, 
In the country lived ( the daughter of a 
farmer); 
So, natural enough, next morning with a 
puff, 
I 
was soon locked in the embrace of my charmer. 
She met me at the train, and how can I 
explain 
3Iy ecstacy or how I 
was behaving ?

But I 
kissing  
was away, when I 
heard an old man say, 
" 
To cool his love he'd better try some bathing." 
So, next morning I 
arose, and the weather being 
close, 
Determined on a 
dipping in the rivr. 
So I 
told the servantmaid that I 
going was to 
bathe. 
And at eight o'clock I'd be returning thither. 
Two hundred yards I 
swam from the spot where I 
began, 
To an island, when for breath I 
almost craving, 
From the water up arose, turned round to find my 
clothes, 
But all had disappeared while I 
was bathing. 
I 
shaking was like leaves when I 
saw the nasty 
thieves, 
I 
shouted out, " You sacrilegious wretches, 
Take my coat, my boots and hat, satin vest and 
silk cravat, 
But for decency do bring rue back my breeches. 
But all was no avail, they were off and in full sail. 
Not e'en a 
pair of socks could I 
be saving. 
When, my troubles on to force, in a 
boat a 
gent 
across 
Pulled two ladies to the spot where I 
was bathing. 
Oh, judge of my surprise, I 
could scarce believe 
my eyes, 
When I 
saw that one was Mary, my intended. 
I 
was dumb, I 
had no choice; if I 
spoke she'd 
know my voice, 
And look a 
thing that ought to be prevented. 
So I 
dodged around the isle, till a 
quarter of a 
mile 
Stood between me and the boat, I 
almost raving, 
When, agreeable to view, and by chance most 
lucky, too, 
I 
saw another individual come bathing.

I 
soliloquized, " Here goes; I 
must have a 
suit of 
clothes, 
Or they'll raise a ' hue and cry' for Mary's lover, 
So in I 
plunged once more, and swam towards the 
shore, 
And took his, for one good turn deserves another. 
He saw me in the fact, and I 
scarce knew how to 
act 
To get out of the dilemma I 
was braving. 
So away I 
quickly ran, saying, " Catch me if you 
can," 
But he couldn't in the state that he was bathing. 
Like a 
tiger home I 
tore, kept knocking at the door, 
The servant she refusing to admit me. 
While creating these alarms, I 
rushed in Mary's 
arms 
In a 
suit of corduroys that didn't fit me. 
I 
very soon explained why I 
had been detained, 
And was laughing, though the theft was most 
depraving, 
When a 
man wrapt in a 
sheet and with nothing on 
his feet, 
Came and asked to see the gent who'd been out 
bathing. 
Said Mary, " Dear, it's true, this man is wanting 
you, 
I 
wish I'd known what made you stay away. 
I 
saw you all the while, you were dodging round 
the isle ; 
But, to tell the truth, I 
didn't like to say so." 
So the stairs I 
stumbled down, while I 
nearly broke 
my crown, 
And apologized for rudely thus behaving. 
But now rob me if you can, for I'm since a 
married 
man, 
And Mary minds my clothes when I 
go bathing.

comes, I 
know, 
I 
wish it would make haste and come, but ' tis so

No doubt you will desire to know what it's really

Oh ! Ge-mi-ni, cri-key, blow me tight!

(Repeat.) 
My Susan is a

head of hair; 
She's often taken for a

about, 
And I 
always feel so happy when it's Susan's Sun-
day out. 
Olt ! Gemini, crikey, etc. 
She must have lots of perquisites, for she brings me 
lots of meat, 
Tho' sometimes, in the summer time, they isn't 
over sweet; 
She keeps me well in panum, that's what makes me 
look so stout, 
And don't I 
just blow out my kite on Susan's Sun-
day out!

I'm thirsty to-night, Jim, without you,' 
And I 
sigh for a 
swig of old rye; 
For I 
know there are stamps, Jim, about you, 
Whenever I'm hungry or dry. 
Like a

is the thirst that I 
cannot conceal ; 
But I'm busted, and can't he beguiling, 
Though I'm trying to raise a 
square meal. 
CHORUS. 
Then, Jimmy, you never must beat me, 
I 
have no more stamps to conceal; 
Oh! I'm lonely for some one to treat me, 
And trying to raise a 
square meal! 
Oh! the lager flows free in Hoboken, 
As if every glass that we drew 
Informed me that excise was broken, 
And reminds me of bourbon and you; 
But I've drank, Jim, so often without you, 
And you don't know how jolly I 
reel; 
But I'm thirsty to-night, Jim, without you, 
And trying to raise a 
square meal. 
Then, Jimmy, you never, etc. 
Oh! why should I 
beat or go borrow'? 
Why should I 
let pluck lose its place'? 
Won't you treat me, dear Jimmy, to-morrow, 
As I 
smile on your rum- beaten face 
Won't you treat me'?? oh! say, won't you treat me, 
With some sugar and gin, at the lane'? 
And I'll promise, whenever you treat me, 
That I 
never will beat you again.

THE CHARMING YOUNG WIDOW I 
MET IN THE 
TRADI . 
AIRâJenny Jones. 
W HILST in New Jersey a 
letter was sent to me 
From Boston, which bid me quick repair 
To an uncle, it stated, fast he was dying, 
The wish he'd expressed to make nie his heir. 
So hurriedly packing a 
few things together, 
Wishing that Boston quickly might gain, 
By a 
first-class express went; in the same carriage, 
A 
charming young widow I 
met in the train. 
An infant she had, so fondly caressing, 
I 
ventured to ask, if that was her own, 
She answered in words appearing distressing, 
" 
Yes, and its papa is dead and gone." 
When the question I 
asked, in my face looking, 
That look I 
shall ne'er be forgetting again ; 
In fact, fast my heart to herself was hocking, 
Was the charming, young widow 1 
met in the 
train. 
As the train it was stoppin ,T, the engine to water, 
She asked in a 
hurry, would I 
be so kind 
Iler infant to take it, the darling so quiet 7 
Of course, I 
replied, I 
didn't mind. 
To the refreshment-room she went into ; 
The signal for starting I 
heard, but in vain, 
Not a 
glimpse could I 
see of her, the train without 
started 
The charming young widow I 
met in the train. 
Loud I 
was shouting, the train to be stopping, 
Out of the window putting my head ; 
No answer receiving, the infant I 
took it, 
Discovered, oh, horror! it was dead!

On its bosom was sewn a 
note, which on reading, 
Found I 
was taken in, done for, quite plain; 
It begged Inc bury the child for the sake of 
The charming young widow I 
met in the train. 
It was strange to myself that I 
was remarking 
how quiet a 
child, not hearing a 
sound ; 
The sweet little creature asleep was, she told me ; 
Quite dead asleep, so, in truth, I 
found. 
I 
took it, and buried the poor little creature, 
Its age or its name I 
could not explain ; 
On a 
stone was inscribed, underneath was bequeath-
ed me 
By a 
charming young widow I 
met in the train.

IT'S 
WONDERFUL HOW WE DO IT, 
BUT WE DO. 
NAPOLEON used to say " There's no such word as 
fail 
Now I 
believe that saying to be true. 
We have only to put our shoulder to the wheel, 
And we'll find that we can work it through. 
We have all some aim in life, no matter high or low, 
We have always some object in view ; 
So, if we only try, we surely will succeed ; 
it's wonderful how we do it, but we do. 
I 
know I 
am not vain, but, like all other men, 
I've a 
very good opinion of myself; 
So I 
made up my mind, that the lady I 
would wed 
Should marry me for love and not for pelf. 
Now the girl that I 
love didn't fancy me at all ; 
She said that I 
was fickle and untrue, 
So I 
resolved to show her how we men could per-
severe ; 
It's wonderful how we do it, but we do. 
Now, I 
made up my mind that I 
would leave her be, 
Which, of course, was hurtful to her pride ; 
When she saw I 
didn't care in her company to be, 
She always wished me by her side. 
I 
proposed, and was accepted, says she, 
" 
My dear, I 
love no one but you." 
We were wed, and now we try each other to please ; 
It's wonderful how we do it, but we do. 
I've been married just eight years, and during that 
time 
Of children twelve little dears we have got. 
I 
see that you all \yonder how in such short time 
Of little ones we could get such a 
lot.

I 
really never thought we should have so many 
babies ; 
It's wonderful how we do it, but we do. 
So now I'll end my song, for fear I'd tire you out, 
Or else your kindness I'd abuse ; 
But I 
promise the next time I'm called on for a 
song, 
Ill do the best I 
can to amuse ; 
For the patience and forbearance which you've 
shown to-niolit, 
My thanks to you are sincere and true;

movements were graceful, all girls he could 
please, 
And my love he purloined away. 
This young man by name was " Signor Bona 
SlareT," 
Tall, big, and handsome, as well made as Chang. 
Where'er he appeared the hall loudly rang, 
With ovation from all people there. 
He'd smile from the bar on the people below, 
And one night he smil'd on my love, 
S:12 wInit'd back at him and she shouted " bravo!" 
As he hung by his nose up above ! 
He'd fly, etc. 
Her father and mother were both on my sale, 
And very hard tried to make her my own bride; 
Her father he sighed, and her mother she cried, 
To see her throw herself away. 
'Twas all no avail, she went there ev'ry night, 
And would throw him bouquets on the stage, 
Which caus'd him to meet her, how he ran me 
down, 
To tell you would take a 
whole page. 
He'd fly, etc. 
One night, I 
as usual, went to her dear home, 
Found there her mother and father alone ; 
I 
ask'd for my love, and soon they made known, 
To my horror, that she'd run away ! 
She'd pack'd up her box and elop'd in the night, 
With hint with time great:st of ease ; 
From two stories high he had lower'd her down 
To the ground on his flying trapeze ! 
He'd fly, etc.

went to a

By Marcus's Paris excursion, to spend a week's

She wanted no persuasion, but got up for the occa-
sion. 
We took ourselves from London Bridge the Exhibi-

Scarce had we arrived in France, things went

And never knew what we had eat, till we found 
them moving " here." 
She began to talk French to the Valet de Shongâ 
perhaps about meâ she ".vas talking so long, 
Running me down, as she could speak the tongue. 
Of French not a 
word could I 
say, oh, no ! 
Oh, sweet Isabella! etc. 
Isabella, you couldn't resist her; just here she 
raised a 
blister, 
When once ;or hours I 
missed her, and knew the 
Frenchman kissed her. 
One day she thought me sleeping; not me, for I 
was peeping, 
And saw my foreign brother with his arms around

TURNIP RADISHES. 
Sung with great success by eftArtLEs VxviAN. 
I'm what is termed an actor, I 
play before the 
scenes, 
But I, alas ! have been betrayed by a 
lady in her 
teens. 
She used to come and see me, when I 
my part 
would play, 
At the old Bowery Theatre, she'd pass her time 
away. 
Her trade, I 
need not mention, but in Centre Market 
she, 
Behind a 
stall of onions, this maiden fair you'd see. 
She did a 
trade in onions, sold potatoes, all serene, 
To me she sold a 
bunch of turnip radishes. 
I 
was strolling in the market, wanted something for 
my tea, 
When behind this stall of onions this maiden I 
did 
see. 
Nightshade; or, Claude. Duval the Dashing Highwayman. 
Imagination never conceived aught so perilous as this man's life.

Her face it was the fairest, her hands were white 
and long, 
And, judging front her countenance, she was a 
maiden young. 
I 
glanced down at her basket, I 
peeped up in her eye, 
She gave a 
glance at me, then asked me, " what I'd 
buy." 
I 
didn't like to tell her, ' twas her l'd like to have, 
So I 
bought a 
penny bunch of turnip radishes. 
Next day I 
paid a 
boy to take to her a 
note. 
An expression of my love, these were the words I 
wrote : 
" 
I'm an actor at the play, and I 
want to climb a 
tree, 
But I 
fear I 
never shall, unless you'll marry me." 
I 
said I 
had two rooms, well furnished for a 
wife, 
Our days they would be happy, free from all care 
and strife, 
At night with me she'd.go while I 
acted at the 
play, 
In the day- time I 
could sell her turnip radishes. 
She sent an answer back to say, she must give me a 
trial, 
So we each other courted for a 
little whole ; 
Then I 
put her in the box the first night that we 
went, 
The part I 
had to play each word I 
did forget. 
'Twas Edwin Booth played hamlet, while my part 
was the ghost ; 
I 
never thought of Hamlet, ' twas her I 
thought of 
most, 
Instead of saying the partâ" farewell, remember 
me," 
I 
cried, " who'll buy a 
bunch of turnip radishes 7" 
I 
thought I'd won her heart, but, oh, ' twas my mis-
take, 
Nightshade on the Heath; or, Claude and the King. 
The monarch and the highwayman are here brought face to face. 3

" 
She loved me as a 
friend," she said, but me she 
did forsake 
For the company of another, which filled me with 
despair. 
I 
thought that I 
would drown myself, in the foun-
tain of a 
square, 
But no bathing was allowed, so I 
didn't trespass in, 
So I 
took to other waters, but those I 
mixed with 
gin, 
But then to cook my goose, I 
found they were no 
use, 
So I 
tried to choke myself with turnip radishes. 
NOT FOR JOSEPH. 
This song, which has become so popular :n 
this country, 
was written by the great English Comique, ARTHUR LOYD, 
and was presented 13;- him to CHARLES ViviAN, who first 
sang it in America. 
I'VE seen a 
bit of gayety throughout norshort career, 
I 
once was foolish with my tin, but. I 
have paid 
most dear. 
If folks would seek to take rue in they find it is 
no go, 
I'm up to almost everythirgâyou can't get over Joe.

And chatted gayly down the street, but e'er I 
went 
away, 
I 
kindly asked this languid swell to take a 
little 
drain. 
" 
Oh, yes," said he, " I 
think I 
will, and let it be 
champagne." 
SPOKEN.âNo you don't, my dear fellow, you] 
don't get any champagne out of Joseph. 
Oh, no, no, no, etc. 
Some time ago, a 
friend of mine, he asked me out 
to dine, 
And there he introduced me to one he called divine. 
He said she'd make a 
charming wife and had such 
lots of tin, 
A 
widow, only forty-two, my boy: go in and win. 
SPOKEN.âMatrimony may be very nice, as a 
matter o' money, but a 
widow at forty-two I 
could' 
see the joke of having. 
How pretty I 
should have 
looked walking down the Broadway with a 
lady 
old enough to be my mother. 
I 
thought of this, and 
cooly replied, " Many thanks, my dear fellow, for 
your kindness, but say on this occasion " 
Oh, dear, no, not for Joe, etc. 
And now, perhaps, I've sung my song, you might 
be in the cue 
To show your kind acknowledgments, but that 
with me won't do. 
As for to-night I've done my best, and that you 
ought to know, 
So if you want a 
song again, don't try it on with 
Joe.

THE LEADING ACTOR. 
Sung by CHARLES VIVIAN. 
I'm very fond of acting, but that's no fault of mine, 
So went to the " Old Bowery," made up to cut a 
shine; 
I 
there beheld a 
charming girl, and made signs to 
attract her, 
Az*.d saw that she looked sly at me as she spoke to 
the leading actor. 
CHORUS. 
For oh, she was a 
charming girl, 
And sail, " she loved 110 one but me," 
But then, you know, I 
need not tell . 
Her love for Inc was all fiddle-cie-dee.

WHAT PLEASURE WE FIND WHEN WITH POCK-

W HAT pleasure we find when, with pockets well

On Broadway we start in the morning ;

And to do the thing small we are scorning.

At the Western we (line, and the day is so fine 
That we go for a 
trip on the water; 
And we do it. in style, and we win a 
sweet smile 
From Mrs. Smith's rosy- faced daughter. 
In the evening we start, and oh, don't we look 
smart, 
To the theatre to pass a 
few hours, 
And to a 
fair girl, with her hair all in curl, 
We present a 
bouquet of sweet flowers. 
We press her fair hand, and you all understand 
What volumes that action expresses. 
And we gaze in her eves, and the time quickly flies 
With our innocent little caresses. 
But when funds are low, we don't know where to 
go, 
And a 
long, gloomy face then we carry; 
We drink lager beer, and we feel very queer, 
And over the last glass we tarry. 
No fair lady smiles or attempts by her wiles 
To allure us from pathways of virtue; 
None say, " Come, old boy, it will give me much 
joy, 
And another glass never will hurt you." 
But I 
keep you too long, much I 
fear, with my 
song, 
And I 
hope you have plenty of money, 
For in these bard times if a 
man has no dimes, 
his life is not all sweet as honey. 
But whether or no, and wherever we go, 
Let us act to each man as a 
brother; 
Amidst ups and downs, and Ivhene'er fortuno 
frowns, 
Let us try and assist one another.

DE WIT'T'S 
TEN CENT ROMANCES. 
Each book contains one hundred pages, printed on fine white paper, and 
enclosed in a handsome cover, with an Illustrated engraving; and sold 
at the remarkably low price of TEN Cza -rs. 
_. The Demon of the Desert. 
This hook is one of the most powerfully 
exciting 
novels 
ever written. 
The 
scenes are laid in the laud of the rifle, 
the tomahawk and the scalping-knife, 
Terrible 
adventures crimson almost 
every page. 
No. 2. Prairie Pete; or, The 
Trapper's Avenger. 
Of all the tales of 
wild adventure in forest and prairie 
this is the most excellent. The reader 
seems to actually hear the yell of the 
demon red- skins, sees 
their painted 
faces, and witnesses the lurid flames of 
the frontier log cabin. 
No. 3. Wild Bill, the Indian, 
Slayer. Wild Bill,who is an inveter-
ate hater of the Indians. 
He never 
walks out of the house without a 
brace 
of fine revolvers shin to his waist, and 
woe to the Indians that cross his path. 
No. 4. The Death Trail. 
Vividly 
are these pages filled with the doings of 
the

by the corpse of his wife, and his awful 
revenge upon her slayer, in the ruined 
wigwam.

page of this thrilling book is ful l 
of in-
cident.

and excites them to deeds of despera-
tion. No book of its class can begi.i to 
oompare with it. 
No. 6. Six- Shooter Jim. This 
book will find readers as long as there 
exists a 
taste for the wild, the terrible, 
and the sanguinary. It is a 
truthful 
picture of real life as it exists upon the 
frontiers where the revolver, meets the 
rifle, the tomahawk and scalping knife. 
No. 7. The Wrecker's -Victim. 
This Story is terribly interesting. The 
daughter of the iron- hearted smuggler 
and the wrecker is one of the loveliest 
maidens that ever pressed foot on sea-
sand. Her admirers were many among 
the ruffians that surround herâruffians 
more cruel than the awful waves that 
dash on the wreck- strewn shore 
by 
which she lives. 
No. 8. The Storm Child. The 
dark caverns that honey-comb the storm 
lashed shores of Cornwall witness terri-
ble crimes in their recesses.

position were attempted, arson and mur-
der were added to the other dark deeds.

lug. 
No. 11. Sam Sutton, the Scalp 
Tak,r. In this boek figure many of 
the Indians who are now snaking the 
Great Plains a " dark and bloody 
ground." Sans will be readily recogniz-
â¢ 
ed as a 
real character by all our officers 
who have been stationed in the Indian 
country.
