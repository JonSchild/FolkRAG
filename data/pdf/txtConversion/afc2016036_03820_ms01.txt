Laura Orleans: Today is February 10th in the year 2017. This is an interview for the New 
Bedford Fishing Heritage Center funded by an Archie Green Fellowship from the Library of 
Congress. As part of this project we are interviewing shoreside workers in the New Bedford- 
Fairhaven fishing industry to record their stories, document their skills and knowledge and better 
understand their important role in the fishing industry. The recording and transcript will become 
part of the permanent collection of the Library of Congress. I am Laura Orleans and today I am 
speaking with... 
John Miranda: John Miranda 
LO: John Miranda at R. A. Mitchell Company in New Bedford. I actually don't know the time. I 
think it’s about 3 o'clock in the afternoon. 
JM: Yeah, ifs about... 
LO: It’s ok. (laughter) 
JM: Three seventeen. 
LO: Three seventeen. Ok. So I will have you sign something when you're done, but for the 
record do you give us permission to record you for this project? 
JM: Yeah I do. 
LO: So I know that you just said your name, but I'm going to ask you to just kind of introduce 
yourself 
JM: OK, my name is John Miranda. I've been with R.A. Mitchell since 1984. Been through a 
lot of ups and downs and we... .projects change, and different manufacturers, and, for the fishing 
business to adjust to new technologies basically. Thaf s about it. 
LO: Great, and when and where were you born? 
JM: I was bom in Febmary 13, 1961, in Portugal, a little town right next to the water. And I 
came to the United States in 1980, April 1980.1 had a degree from vocational technical school, 
as a machinist, based on a little bit of mechanical work and electrical and when this opportunity 
showed up to work for Mitchell, I started working as part-time. I was working at a machine shop, 
full time, and then working part time at R.A. Mitchell. Then it got to the point where I know I 
definitely like this. Thaf s when I decided to become a full-time employee. 
LO: So what town were you bom in in Portugal? 
Interview with John Miranda, Febmary 10, 2017

JM: In Alvaro. Its close by to Porto. It's about 58 kilometers south of Porto, right on, right on 
the water. Like I said, right on the Atlantic Ocean. On the other side of the river, like we say. 
LO: And did you have family in the fishing industry in Portugal? 
JM: Yeah, my father was a fisherman all of his life, anyway, basically, but he never really 
wanted his kids to follow his footsteps, cause he knew what he went through. That's when 
fishing was very rough. If s like all hard work, and we are a big family. He had nine kids, my 
oldest ones, I have two sisters and now I only have one. One passed away last year. Seven boys 
in a row. And I am the youngest one and they never really like to have any of his kids in the 
fishing industry. Let's put it that way. So that's why when I, he always try to force us to go to 
school. Even though he didn't know how to read or write, but he forced us to go to school. Try to 
get something else aside from the fishing industry basically. And that’s what happened. 
LO: And was he fishing as part of what they call the White Fleet on the Grand Banks, or was 
he more... 
JM: No, no, just local. All local. One of my brothers did, cause back in the old days, we had to 
go the military service by the age of 18, you had to enlist and then they gave him the option, 
either you go the military service or you can go fishing for seven years. He didn't make much, so 
my brother decided to go. He did. He went to the big factory boats, to Saint John's and all over. 
And once that was over he said, no more. He was a carpenter. So he decided to stay with the 
administrate? instead of Of course back then you didn't make much as a fisherman, as you 
know. Even around here, I remember back in the 80's a lot people were struggling. But I guess 
now, we picked up a little especially the scallopers industry. 
[05:06] LO: So the vocational training that you had, was that in Portugal? 
JM: Yes. 
LO: And then what brought your family to the United States? 
JM: My oldest sister she was married with an American man that was actually Italian 
descendant, but he was born here already in the U.S. and he had a lot of family connections like 
in my little town and he says, I want to get married, but I want somebody from this town. And 
the people that he knew, they said, I think we know exactly the right person. So it was kind of 
like a... and then everything came out. And my sister started to bring some of my brothers. My 
parents were never here. I came to America when I was turning 20 and I didn't have my parents 
here or nothing and it was like, just, I was the last one to America basically in 1980. All the other 
ones some of them started to come in the 70's, early 70's.

LO: Did you speak English at that point? 
JM: I had a, in school, even in technical school we need to take two languages, which was 
English and French, we had to take. So basically, I could read and write a little bit, but I couldn't 
understand it because the English is from England. That's with an England accent and I'm..but 
that helped. It helped a lot. As far as, a matter of fact that a few years after a few years that I was 
in U.S. I took my GED and of course I passed then I started to go to technical schools of course, 
because of the new technologies through Mitchell. Like for John Deere, Deutz, a German engine, 
and Atlanta. So it's a lot of interesting new, since we started ah the way to now, as far as 
technologies go, what a change. And even in the fishing industry. 
LO: How did you find out about the job here? 
JM: A friend of mine that we used to hang around once in a while. He says, “John, they're 
looking for somebody at Mitchell." " I don't, I really don't know anything about diesels" I used to 
work with motorcycles even back in Portugal. And I said, "I know about gasoline engines and 
stuff like that but not about diesels." He says, "John, if s easier!" And back then, the old engines 
that we used to work with, the Listers, it’s like you start up, you don't even need any electrical to 
start an engine, started by hand, that's what made Lister better, so famous around the fishing 
industry. Because they rely so much on charging the batteries, or pumping the water pumps and 
they needed something that in an emergency, they need to start up no matter what. And those 
things would. Start up by hand with hand crank. And I really liked that though. I really, really 
like it once I started to get involved in the project. I enjoyed it, and I love it. I love my job 
basically. Thaf s what it is. 
LO: So tell me little about, if you remember, what it was like to learn those first weeks that you 
came here. 
JM: To Mitchell? 
LO: Mmhm 
JM: If s something totally different. I had no idea how the whole...I knew about a spark related 
engines. You got a coil that energizes spark and ignites and ignites the gasoline, ignites the fuel. I 
says, “what ignites the diesel?” So come to find out, I had to learn, diesels rely a lot on high 
compression and a lot of air, basically. Atomizing the fuel to the point where that it blends with 
the air going into the engine and it explodes like that with a high compression! How is that 
possible?! And so then, other things started to show up, and Bob decides to join me. Ready to get 
on the road. And my first job was like 6 months later. I'm in Boston, the Boston fish pier. Like 
and "Bob, I don't think I'm ready for this!" And right then there was no cell phones or nothing 
Interview with John Miranda, February 10, 2017

that you could rely on, that you could call somebody and ask what information that's basically 
what it is. It was hard, it was interesting. And then a lot of learning like taking books, workshop 
manuals at home at night and going through all of them, and plus we had a really good man out 
in the back, the foreman, the shop foreman, back then, Xavier, he was unbelievable. He's still 
alive. He's 83, he's full of energy. He comes around and he is a really, really good teacher, as far 
as he... And plus. Bob is unbelievable. Bob is. He knows, even though, he used to get his hand 
dirty, back in the day. And he knows, so. I learned a lot with them. And then now, we kind of all 
have to work together and learn the new technologies, because that's the way it is. 
[11:11] LO: Tell me about how you've seen some change over your 30-32 years or so? Whaf s 
changed here? 
JM: At the company? 
LO: At the company.... 
JM: At the company itself? At the fishing industry itself? 
LO: All of the above. 
JM: The back of the, when we used to work in the fishing boat back then. If you don't have a 
good flashlight to work with, you're in trouble. Cause most of the time if they're down, with what 
they call the auxiliary engines, the engines that they depend on to charge batteries, for the 
lighting system, back in the old days, they did not have AC, it was all DC. All battery-operated 
light, motors, everything. And most of the times when you go work on one of those units that's 
because they're down. They're dead in the water basically, and that's what work with a flashlight 
on the engine, looking for lef s say, fuel mixed in the oil. If s like, if s so hard to see it already as 
it is, the fuel blend in with the oil, never mind now when if s that dark. Now if s like we got the 
luxury of even shut the engines down and work in a really nice light area with shore power. That, 
the huge change with all of those changes that we've seen along the years. Which is for the better 
anyway. It's for the best. Even for the fishermen, now they can depend on the computer system. 
They depend on emails they have to keep on going back and forth with the Federal, because of 
the rules and they do need the AC, the luxury. Now they got AC on boats... 
LO: Sat TVs! 
JM: Exactly. So if s a long period of time, if s a short period of time and a lot changes for the 
best, of course anyway. 
LO: So you mentioned the flashlight, but what other tools do you bring with you on a job? 
Interview with John Miranda, February 10, 2017 
7 
JM: Basically, back in the old days the toolbox, we knew exactly what sizes we need for the 
job that we were doing. Small toolbox, some of the fisherman used to make fun of me. Like, 
"What are you gonna do with your lunch box?" If s like, I says, "Don't worry about it. If I can't 
fix it with this lunchbox, you're in trouble." And that was sometimes it was funny because some 
them didn't take it a little serious about it, like, "I don't think you're ready to work on my engine 
with just that amount of tools." I says, "Don't worry about it. I'll figure something out." And it 
really depended of course. Most of it was just standard sizes. S.A.E. sizes. Now we gotta carry a 
variety of tools. Like a lot metric, a lot of special tools that we keep, that are designed just for 
specific engines. The new engines, you gotta carry a laptop to plug in. Because without that, we 
can't read the codes. The codes, yeah they don't mean much if you don't have the right tool to 
find out what that code means and what you can do to solve that problem. That's why a lot of the 
fishermen are still scared about that technology, because if that happens when I'm out fishing 
what's gonna happen? Am I going to be without a generator? And some of the boats only have 
one generator set. We still have a few out there that only have one generator set. 
[15:12] LO: So what happens in that case? When they're out at sea? They call? 
JM: Yeah, most of them, sometimes they call. They ask for the basic what they can look for. 
Sometimes if s something as simple code meaning that they have low fuel pressure, lef s say. 
Low fuel pressure is a start by changing your filters. Most of the times if you don't have enough 
fuel pressure on the primary system the higher pressure is not gonna to develop. It's only 
common sense. But, most, sometimes thaf s what it is. Sometimes they get a little bit of water in 
the fuel tank and engines don't like water, at all! Especially any engine don't like water, but a 
diesel they can blow up a tip of an injection, especially now. Back in the old days, the old 
injector used to fire at 3200 PSI or something. And now they open at like at sometimes at 26000 
PSI. That's a huge difference. Thaf s the only way to control the emissions basically anyway. So 
thaf s a lot of changes as far as the tools that we have to carry. Of course, we can't bring 
everything at once to the boat. We gotta go over there and trouble shoot it, keep it in the truck 
and then go back and try to solve the problem. 
LO: I was going to ask you if you can describe. I don't know if there's a typical day? But how 
does your day start? What time do you get here? And what's the first thing that you do? 
JM: I usually get up like quarter of six. and start at 7:30.1 like to take my time. I have my 
coffee at home. And start at 7:30 most of the... sometimes we don't have a time to start. 
Sometimes there's an emergency. You're on the role there are two, three o'clock in the morning. 
Yeah, cause we get a lot of jobs in the New York, New Jersey area on the barges. Upstate New 
York, even down south sometimes we have emergency calls. Not because we are better than 
anybody else, but they feel more comfortable with us. Some jobs in the Caribbean too. I've been 
in Anguilla, an island right next to St. Martin a couple of times. 
Interview with John Miranda, February 10, 2017

LO: That sounds nice. 
JM: It was in the winter. Nice weather. Temperature is perfect. And that's about it. Work never 
ends usually it's 7:30 to 4 o'clock, but no exactly. 
LO: Is there a job that is sort of most common? Whaf s the most common thing that goes 
wrong on a boat? 
JM: Believe it or not, most of the time it's fuel related. Even knowing that they lack of 
maintenance sometimes, filters, or sometimes water that gets in a fuel tank through a crack, a 
vent pipe, anything that could cause that situation. And that's what you got to check first, is your 
basics. If s like, do you have, what do you got for fuel? Or what do you got for air system? And 
basically thaf s the most common problem believe it or not with the fishing industry. 
LO: So can you think of a time, maybe a really challenging job that you worked on where you 
know, you figured it out? Anything that stands out? 
JM: Yeah, we had a few, sometimes. When you think that you know it all and the symptoms 
are the same, the problem is always different. They ... sometimes the basic, one of them that I 
remember was a brand-new installation and they, a small lobster boat, fiberglass, fiber glass 
tanks, fuel tanks. It was local around here, Mattapoisett. They installed the engines on the yard, 
the shipyard where they build the boat and they started the engine. Started to run the boat and the 
boat had no power. The engine had no power. It was like choking, choking. And so I think the 
boat was built in Canada. They tried to bring the boat by the water, but they couldn’t and they 
put it on the trailer. Somebody got involved in it changed the injection pump. And finally they 
says, “Why don't you, can you please send somebody over?” It was a John Deere engine. So I 
did, I went over and started to look at it. And if s like ,"Wow, I really can't find anything wrong 
with it." Brand new unit, nothing wrong with the application, fuel lines were the right size, and 
then I said, “There's gotta be something wrong on a fuel system.” So I took the fuel system apart. 
What they call the rake, or the fuel water separator. And you know what I found? All the fibers 
that got washed from inside the fuel tank launched in a valve that controls the system to separate 
the water from the fuel and that was it. That was as simple as that, but it's challenging 
sometimes. One time I had one boat in Sandwich still, with a fuel line, the return line it looked 
perfect on the outside and the fuel got into the rubber, it started to bubble up. Almost created like 
a balloon and was restricting and closed and the owner, the boaf s name was the Terry Anne, if s 
still around. And he says John, "How did you figure that out? How did you get to that point?" I 
says, “You gotta start with the basics, with the common sense. You don't just start to throw parts 
at it then all the sudden it’s like, "You didn't check that first?" So most of the time you got to 
take a little bit longer to troubleshoot a problem rather than jump into a conclusion and starting 
to throw parts at a unit basically.

[22:20] LO: So you clearly said you love your job, and it shows. What do you enjoy the most? 
JM: The friendship in this company is, we all get along, which that helps and the challenge too. 
I love the challenge. When you think that you have all the problems solved, something else 
shows up. 
LO: Alright, tough question with the boss standing right here. What's your least favorite part of 
the job. 
JM: (Laughing) Going to work on a certain boat! I won't say the name. That's right, it's not 
around if s gone. There's one more but I don't want to say it. 
Bob: As soon as you can, wrap up. 
LO: Yes, we will do that.. .Ok, Well I think we've actually covered a fair amount of ground. Is 
there anything in particular that, you know, I didn't cover that you wanted to add? 
JM: Not really, as far as my job goes as related to the fishing industry. We're not just strictly 
with the fishing industry. We do a lot of construction equipment. Sand and gravel crushers, 
screeners, concrete pumps, like you name it any kind, if s like just worked on one that was 
putting up a building, a fifty-footer, in Boston, and they were experiencing a problem. Of course 
thaf s the only time that we get a call is a problem. But as far as the fishing industry, I would like 
to see these guys having some more days of fishing, basically. Not just, some of them to make a 
living, the fishermen itself and the owners too. They have to pick up, they have to pay for those 
expenses, especially if you, the small business guy that will try to get into the fishing industry is 
not going to be able to afford it basically, especially at the prices, let's say a license. Thaf s 
something that I would like to see. Cause back in the 80's you could see like every single boat 
had a different owner. Now you got like 30 boats with the same owner. It's like thaf s the only 
difference that I would like to see. A little bit more spread. I think it would work out a lot better. 
Would give somebody an opportunity to get into the business. And the way it is, if you don't 
have the right amount of money to get into the business, you can't. 
LO: I think the waterfront is a pretty special community in some ways. 
JM: Yeah we spend half of our lives around that waterfront basically. And yeah you see a lot of 
changes. Thaf s why you don't see a lot of the new people getting into the business. First of all, 
especially on the draggers, there's no money to be made. Most of the people decide they better go 
into construction or something than becoming a fisherman. 
LO: Well it sounds like Bob needs his office back. 
Interview with John Miranda, February 10, 2017 
10 
JM: No actually he wants to go over...He needs me and the other John to go over a few major 
units. 
LO: Let me ask you one last question. So it's a family business, and Bob's daughters are taking 
the running. Whaf s it like to have two young women as your bosses? 
JM: I don't mind at all. They learn the business. They're very good. They're very sharp and they 
know that they can rely on us for a lot of technical stuff When they don't know, they know what 
to ask and when to ask. And that’s the good thing about it. It not like they strictly office people. 
They worked together with everybody. 
LO: How many people work here? I was... 
JM: I think there's like 24, at one point it was 25. I think now if s a little bit less. Probably 
somewhere around 18 to...yeah. 
LO: And thank you very much. I appreciate you taking some time away. 
JM: No problem. 
LO: I'm sure you've got lots of work. 
JM: No problem. Anytime. 
LO: Excellent. 
JM: Alright. 
LO: Thank you. 
JM: Thanks, my pleasure.
