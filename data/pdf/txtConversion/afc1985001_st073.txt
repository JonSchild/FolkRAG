THE MARRIAGE COLORS
Bill Jackson Arvin, 1941
White, Oh white, oh white, oh dear - White, Oh white color Jenkins I wouldn't wear white
Cause you'd see it at night I'll buy me a hum-a-dum-a-diddle-a-daddle-dubble-wubble
sackajus-a-boddle-a-bindin's - To wear with the roobajum jenkins.
Pink, Oh pink, oh pink, oh dear Pink, Oh pink color Jenkins I wouln't wear pink Cause the
color would stink I'll buy me a hum-a-dum-a-diddle-a-daddle-dubble-wubble sackajus-a-
boddle-a-bindin's - To wear with the roobajum jenkins.
Brown, Oh brown, oh brown, oh dear Brown, Oh brown color Jenkins I wouldn't wear
brown Cause it's the color of the town I'll buy me a hum-a-dum-a-diddle-a-daddle-dubble-
wubble sackajus-a-boddle-a-bindin's - To wear with the roobajum jenkins.
Green, Oh green, oh green, oh dear Green, Oh green color Jenkins I wouldn't wear green
Cause the color could be seen I'll buy me a hum-a-dum-a-diddle-a-daddle-dubble-wubble
sackajus-a-boddle-a-bindin's - To wear with the roobajum jenkins.
*This song was explained by Mrs. Myra Pipkin with the following rhymes:
Marry in white You're sure to be right.
Marry in blue You're sure to be true.
Marry in green You're ashamed to be seen.
Marry in brown You'll live in town.
